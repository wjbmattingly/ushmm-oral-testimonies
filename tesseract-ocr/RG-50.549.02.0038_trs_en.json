            "answer": "My grandfather, on my mother\u2019s side, his name was Haim Kabiljo. He came to Split from Sarajevo, a little bit before World War One. He didn\u2019t do too well wherever they lived, so somebody suggested to him that he could come and work with them in Split. He put him in a business doing -- making mattresses by hand. This was what he would do; when people would order, he would custom make a mattress. My grandmother didn\u2019t work. That was not customary for women to work out of the house. My grandfather was also a shamus, which is a sexton in the -- in the synagogue in Split, and he lived right next door, which was provided by the synagogue for him. My grandparents on my father\u2019s side lived in Vizoco, which is the same -- a suburb of Sarajevo now. My gran - grandfather, his name was Isak, I was named for him and so were four of my cousins. He- He didn\u2019t do anything, really. He used to have a grocery store and then he co-signed for somebody on their loan and the other person defaulted, so they took my grandfather\u2019s store in payment. My grandmother\u2019s name was Blanca, which was -- my older sister was named for her. And again, she didn\u2019t work out of the house, but she would take in sewing, so they survived. There was a wh-whole bunch of brothers that were growing up, and she, with her sewing, supported the househo -- the household, excuse me."

            "answer": "My grandfather, Haim Kabiljo, he, as I mentioned earlier, was a sexton, and his main function was, as a sexton, to keep the synagogue in an order, make sure that it\u2019s clean, that it was -- all the things that are needed. And also, one of the big problem was that we had a very small Jewish community and one of the big problems was trying to get a minyan, or a quorum, for the services every day. So he would go searching for people, men. In those days, only men counted for the quorum. He would go around searching and asking them to come to the services. I failed to mention, when he got a little older, and his children were grown up, he s-started sort of s -- a little store, what they sold was yard goods, mostly. It was a very small store, and one of my aunts, I think she was next to the youngest of his children, she worked in that store. My grandfather was well known in the Jewish community, as one can imagine, and my mother had just terrific memories and she always talked about him after he passed away. But I was about nine years old when he died, so I remember him. When we would go visit our parents in our store, we would take a walk and go say hello to him, or we would meet him sometimes on the street and I remember every time we met him, he would reach in his little pocket, which 1s -- he had a watch in the pocket, watch with a chain, and he would pull out a coin. A Yugoslav coin was called a dinar. He always had a dinar for me. That was good for an ice cream or a couple of candies. So ah -- we had tremendous memories of him. Our grandmother, she was a little bit rougher. She didn\u2019t have the finesse to deal with the little children. So our This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now, my other grandmother, I remember her. She was a very hard working woman. She was a good cook and a good baker and she made lots of sweets, which we always enjoyed. She would ship them to us. Once a year we would get a package of all kinds of goods, jellies, marmalades, cookies. Even a homemade salami, occasionally, which I didn\u2019t care too much for, because it had an onion-y smell to it. But these are memories of a childhood. Since then, I learned to love onions."

            "answer": "Yeah. Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives. Both my mother and father had grown up in the religious homes. We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which, for those who don\u2019t know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in Spain, and after the expulsion, they went to either Turkey, or they went to Genoa and crossed over to Italy, or they went to Turkey and moved with the Turkish occupation. They moved further up and of course Sarajevo was Turkish outpost and that\u2019s where they - they must have come that route, I think. Although Split was settled by Jews of Italian descent, which means that the most people who live 1 -- most Jews who lived in Split, came from Spain, through Genoa, through Italy, and crossed over the Adriatic, into Split. As I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives. We observed all of the holidays, quite religiously. We never went to school on any of the Jewish holidays. We maintained a kosher home, and we -- the education was such in Yugoslavia, that the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, because we were a very small minority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would have a free period. And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the- some facility, usually was one central school, well all -- where all the Jewish kids would come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of religious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such.

Where did they fit into town? Do you remember them talking about that, or what was your perception of where they fit?",
            "answer": "Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the town of Split, they were pretty well integrated with the general community. Most of the Jews in Split were either small merchant -- and I\u2019m emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and such. So, I don\u2019t think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up. The- We had, in the neighborhood, we were totally integrated and in the business community, you sa -- s -- have, let\u2019s say, shoe stores, there would be several of them, one might be owned by a Jewish family. The rest would be owned by the local, whatever religion. Prevailing religion in Split, was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they also had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but prevailing Serbs. So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But the classes were conducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the wall and everybody had to say the Catholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them. But this was true fo - both of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids. And some -- some classes, there were a few of those and few Jews. Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was not a Roman Catholic. So I -- I didn\u2019t feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when it was time to be excused. I accepted that gladly. Yeah?"

So everybody considered me like a -- I don\u2019t know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too. I remember now, that I\u2019m being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would be cuddled by every teacher over there. We didn\u2019t have any male teachers, just female teachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married. Anyway, so, nobody ever said anything. I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from somebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer. So I suggested that, and she accepted it for awhile. I guess she was reprimanded later on. But this came - There was at -- somebody who had left Romania and moved to Yugoslavia and this one young girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers.

            "answer": "Yeah, well, that was true for a long while. However, the situation started changing with the political situation. And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over Austria and there was pressure on every country nearby, to sign up with the axis powers. So, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about politics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust. There was a party in the -- in that area, the Croatian area, called Ustashi and they were beginning to rise up, with assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans. And they were agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler\u2019s, you know, values, and preachings and that\u2019s -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more uncomfortable for us.

But we would go further, we would go to the areas that are beach fronts and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn\u2019t crowded -- it wasn\u2019t too crowded. There were people there, because Split was in a -- I won\u2019t call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be shielded from the wind, and our beaches were shielded. So, we would go walk, maybe even take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the surf. And sometimes, or one time, wasn\u2019t just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the neighborhood would start throwing the rocks at us, and stones. And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty well, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end of the stick."

Things that your parents said to you perhaps, or you overheard?",
            "answer": "Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or \u201836, I was only six or seven years old. But in those areas, we -- the kids, six, seven, we were pretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen to the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively. You know, everybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going on. And so we were quite aware. And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there was an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach them some form of a trade, because they were saying, 1n case you have to leave in a hurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you can do with your hands. So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had, like photography, like working with the leather, tailoring. I know my sister took up sewing and she learned pretty well how to sew."

She was two years ahead, she was two years older than I was, so she was telling us how her instructor was making anti-Semitic remarks to the class. And of course, kids caught on and they emulated their professors. And also, there were a few of my, quote, friends, that they would sort of jokingly make an-anti-Semitic remarks, and -- while they\u2019re hugging me and all that, or trying to copy from my homework, they would still make those remarks. So there was no question this was happening as gradually as one can perceive it. And in the meantime, the war started in -- well, there was the Czechoslovakian take over, what we call peace in our times, and then the war started in Poland, that\u2019s 1939. By that time I was 10 years old and I saw what was going on in the world and so did everybody around us. And we saw the signs, we would see the -- these Ustashi, they would have their meetings. I don\u2019t know how to equate this to the current situation. Would be almost like Blacks living integrated with the White community, but every Tuesday night, the White community would don the white sheets and hoods, you know. And so, is that a sign of something? I guess that would indicate, you know, that if -- in case of some trouble, you could not rely on your neighbors too well. So, that was another sign."

He was an immigrant to our community, he was a Jewish young man and he didn\u2019t care for begging, so my father one time suggested to him, why doesn\u2019t he buy some nuts and salt them and toast them and make little bags and sell them? And he did that and I remember our father would always buy two or three bags. He didn\u2019t like the nuts, but he bought them, because this was a way of supporting somebody. And only recently, I was reading about the life of Mimonides, the philosopher and the Jewish theologian, of the what, tw -- 12th century? He -- 12th, yeah. Anyway, and he had -- he wrote on every subject conceivable and one of them was charity. And he had -- he sort of set up eight levels of charity. And I know the highest level is helping somebody become independent and this is what my father believed in. We also believed that the children should get better education that their parents had and we -- we were sent to school, we -- wh-when the war started, Jews were not allowed to go to school, and I think I mentioned that the professors, of course, couldn\u2019t teach, so what we did, we created a Jewish school. The professors that were fired from their jobs, they were employed to teach the Jewish kids who were not allowed to go to school. Well, my father, he had a little misunderstanding with somebody, so he didn\u2019t send us to school, but he engaged tutors to come to our house and teach us things. So, oh -- also, he was teaching us the religious subjects and we learned a lot in the house. When we would go to religious school, we were always top students and like, let\u2019s say if I was in third grade, I would usually be placed with kids of the fifth grade or sixth grade, because of the -- my level of knowledge of the particular This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

My mother was a very, very hard working person, I guess by necessity, because my father didn\u2019t work. We had the store, but he would just go there in the evening. My mother would go early in the morning, open up the place and she would be there all day. And in those days, you opened the store about eight o\u2019clock in the morning, you closed it at 12, you went home for lunch. You went at four, you re-opened and it was opened til eight o\u2019clock. This is, I think throughout Europe, they had this. Some people call it siesta. In summer, I guess, people would go home, eat, and go to sleep for a couple hours. What else did we learn? We learned -- One time I found a wallet that belonged to a construction supervisor and he was ready to fire half of his staff and -- and my -- I ran home with it and my father told me to go back and find who it belongs to. \u201cDon\u2019t give it to anybody until you\u2019re very sure that you find the rightful owner.\u201d And I remember, I had looked inside, there was a lot of money in it, but the guy only gave me one dinar as a reward and I was pretty unhappy about it. But my father told me that the return of the wallet was a reward in itself. I\u2019m a little choked up now, talking about these things because it brings memories. So, maybe if you give me five minutes to get back to my own self, yeah?"

Now, there was enough partisans, they came from the mountain, they organized the local population and there was partisan units marching through the street. If I can mention, Split was a city -- I call it a town, but it was a city of 50,000 people. It was the biggest city in Dalmatia, the coastal- coastal area and much of the interior.

And -- But Split was the capital of one of these, call them states, if -- until I get a better term for it. And so it was a pretty large city. I mean, I remember with pride, looking at the big, tall building, eight floors, nine floors, another one, you know. So, 1-it was wide avenues, tree line avenues, you know, all that. So, the city was sizable and now we saw all these -- the partisans and their insignia was a red star and -- on the cap it was a -- like a military cap, you know, with a red star 1n front of it. And the population started participating, and they would have these meetings, town meetings and you would get maybe 5,000 people show up for the meeting and there was somebody speaking about, you know, we have to arm ourselves and we have to chase the occupation and we\u2019re -- have to do this and that, you know.

So, that was -- was like pretty wild and also like the partisans would conduct trials of the people who had collaborated and in -- there would be signs and you know, posters saying how many were convicted and shot and all that. It was -- maybe it was kangaroo court type, it was very swift and pretty -- I won\u2019t say brutal, but it was swift and final for many people who had collaborated. It was a very sharp division. You\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re with them kind of thing. So the population had committed themselves. And then there was -- the German troops were trying to come into the city, but they were hel - they were held in check at a place where the Turks were held in check several hundred years earlier, the Ottoman empire was held, because it\u2019s such a terrain, the rough terrain, mountains and cliffs, that you can position yourself and you know, it was that kind of warfare that people could establishing -- establish themself and prevent even motorized units and tanks from advancing. So, partisans were able to hold off the German troops for a very long time. And in those days, we were wondering what will happen if the partisans don\u2019t hold the line and the Germans do come. And we didn\u2019t know -- We didn\u2019t think of an if, we were thinking of when, yeah. And that\u2019s -- in those days, we just did what everybody was aware that had to be done, namely prepare, so you can make a quick getaway by whatever means. Some people were thinking of getting a little boat and going to the islands that were near Split. But that wasn\u2019t so safe, because Germany and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Partisans were living off the support that they could get from general population. But Germans were pretty rough if they caught somebody helping the partisans, they burned the entire town. And later on, I remember seeing towns, just everything -- no house had a roof on it, because the roof was burned, you know. The rest was made out of stone, or bricks, so it couldn\u2019t burn, but 1-it was -- or, 1f maybe partisans would kill a German person, the German would just take hundred at random and shoot them. That -- They -- They wouldn\u2019t have to be guilty or they wouldn\u2019t have to be partisans or anything, just hundred citizens, or hundred men, ju -- 0-out of the town, they would take them at random, put them against the wall and shoot them. So -- Okay, so we are in this situation where everybody\u2019s wondering -- you know, the partisans said you have to be either with us or with them, and during those 20 days, lots of people said, \u201cWe're with the partisans.\u201d So when the Germans were coming, then all of these people who had declared themselves to be with the partisans, had to find a way to leave. And the Jewish population, of course, would be the first victims of the German onslaught. And Germans were bad enough, but Croatians were worse. So -- Anyway, sO we were just cognizant of these [indecipherable] and we were ready -- what did it take? Not much. I mean, it\u2019s just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know, a sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don\u2019t know if you know what zwieback 1s? It\u2019s a hard, hard -- it\u2019s not bread, it\u2019s like a, yeah, crust of some sort. Anyway, so I know he had brought that.

They had general mobilization and he -- he didn\u2019t have very pleasant memories from that. I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know he didn\u2019t care for the experience.

I wasn\u2019t going to fight anywhere. So we just left the town when we heard the Germans are coming, and there was no other place to go but the mountains. And if you joined the partisans, you\u2019re -- hopefully, you\u2019re with some -- some organize group. Otherwise, you\u2019re on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange town, you know? And again, the general population of that area was peasant. You know, they live off the land, either as shepherds or as farmers. Once you got into the mountain, there was not much farming, except maybe around your house, you know. No extensive farming of any kind, anywhere. In the lowlands, where I lived, they had like -- grapes was the big thing. And fruit, fruit, different kind. Figs, peaches, cherries. But figs was a big fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes. They -- you know, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and squish them for a wine. You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do. We all have seen movies how that\u2019s done. I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that, yeah. Anyway, so after that, it\u2019s nothing else to do the rest of the year. Well, anyway, so my father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn\u2019t survive in the mountains, among the -- the suther way of life, you know. So, he was out of place, and I guess the entire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it\u2019s in the peasant type environment, you know. Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know, life, because they were not accustomed to it. There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that - that\u2019s in the Jewish genes, they proved in Israel that they can be good farmers and everything else.

And we were accepted, I guess. There was a place for everybody and once we got into this place on Hvar, they found a place for me, too, and I was still 13 years old. I was placed in a machine shop, I guess. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s the best -- the best description of it. But machine shop was making- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the mi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans. I remember, oh there were two kids younger than me in this unit. We were three kids assigned to this unit. One was 11 year old, and one was 12. All f -- All came from Split, similar route that we came. What we were doing, actually, is generating power. It\u2019s a -- like a bicycle, you would just go, you know, drive this bike, stationary bike, but would generate power for the units that they had. We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the ovens, you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know. They weren\u2019t shoeing horses, they were making things out of -- well, let\u2019s say the guns -- I mean the weapons needed certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn\u2019t have it. They take a piece of steel and -- and by hand and hammer, you know. Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat it and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know. And they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know. And I remember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed. And we, the kids were doing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting clothes or whatever for the hospital. You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn\u2019t scratch. Then we would take a metal sheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll. And beat the ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it. So this was a barrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it closed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs. You couldn\u2019t just boil it because you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make it, I don\u2019t know what, 400 - 500, whatever. So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids, did. But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to Hvar, they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these bunkers and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the ground to the bunker and then just lob hand grenade into the small holes in the bunker. And they could do it very silently, so they would not be detected. So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup per -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the bunker and do this kind of job."

If you didn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the villa, then they would fill the rest of it for you. Well here, there was 40 people who found each other. They were all Sephardic Jews from Bosnia and they -- some knew each other from before, some became good friends in the  all this, you know, living in the tran -- in transit, moving around and all that. They became good friends. So they we -- were put in this one villa together and life was good for them, that place. My two aunts were among them. Two aunts and an uncle, one husband of one of the aunts. Anyway -- I\u2019m sorry, and their daughter. They had three daughters. Two were in the partisans and one was with them. So, they were there in -- in this -- Santa Maria was where we were, but next door to it was another village -- a bunch of villas put together, called Santa Croce, which is where they were. And they enjoyed life there, I know, because my aunts were all good cooks -- down, down, down -- my aunts were all good cooks and they volunteered to be cooks over there and like they would get -- down -- they would get food from the military, you know, they would get flour, and dried potatoes -- diced potatoes in cans. This was how the military would give to it\u2019s kitchens. And when we were living in -- with the peasants -- with the local -- I mean, local, from Dalmatian, you know, from the -- when I say peasant, this is not a derogatory term, it\u2019s a people who live off the land, who tilled the land or are shepherds, or are involved in agriculture. So, they -- when we were with them, they would cook the meals, three meals a day, where the flour would be made into paste, and then they would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, this Jewish house, they -- from the flour, they would make pasta, different kind of pasta and I learned how to make pasta myself. You know, it\u2019s really, as a kid, it was fun. And the bacon, because none of us ate it, was swapped with Italians to -- agricultural areas there, Italian, they loved the stuff, so they would give them oil. There was a lot of olives there and oil was a product of the local area. They would give them oil, they would give them green vegetables, onions, and you know, stuff like that. So I remember when we would come and visit my aunt, like you would get -- I mean you eat pasta, you eat fresh vegetables. And they made friends with some American flyers, you know, Air Force officers who were also -- many were from Yugoslavia, because some of the -- from the Yugoslav Royal Air Force, had escaped to London and they were trained to fly US planes, you know. And there was a lot of them nearby, so that they had an opportunity to come and visit civilians and talk in their language, yeah. And they would sometimes bring their buddies from the American flyers, you know, who were not of Yugoslav extraction. And it was fun. And they would bring corned beef cans, you know. And sometimes, like when I would go visit, I mean, you have hamburgers, th-they would make, from the corned beef, they would make hamburgers and you have pasta and you have cauliflower or spinach.

So there was this one outdoor cafe where we used to go hang out, and my father and me and all our friends would meet there. It was called Chinchin, I remember that, na -- yeah, anyway, I took them there and I ordered special ice cream. It\u2019s called, in Italian, it\u2019s called cassati.

This is one time where bureaucracy moved fast and we were able to put them on the manifest to come over to United States with us. Of course, if they couldn\u2019t, we would have just pulled out, but there was the law that was passed, was authorizing 1,000 refugees.

We\u2019d come to meals, sometimes I would see my father then, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. I would see him at night. Since there was no lights, we burned the kerosene.

And frankly, I think unfairly in some cases, because the selection was made on basis of our knowledge of English language, I didn\u2019t know any English, so I was put in seventh grade, even though I was 14 years old. But, you know, people who spoke English, some of my friends, too, were sent to local high school. So I felt a little bit of a -- not resentment, but that I was set back unfairly.

Yeah, it was, I guess, like here, except here schools, you have lunch period and you have lunch rooms. We didn\u2019t have lunch rooms, this was -- this was called junior high school, I guess, and even if we did, we just didn\u2019t carry lunches.

They wanted somebody to put a bond, monitor a bond, to guarantee that we would not become a public charge. So this organization, the Jewish organization called Jewish American Joint Distribution Committee, put the funding -- in other words, they guarantee that -- they guarantee that we would not become a public charge. So, what they were trying to do is, people who are leaving the camp, they were trying to disperse them, so they wouldn\u2019t all go to New York, because they had the mechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same place, because that\u2019s a big burden on one location. So, they interviewed everybody and they convinced my parents to go to Philadelphia. They told them what a great place it is, and in Philadelphia, there is a Sephardic synagogue, which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second synagogue in the United States. Now, the first one was on the Cape -- I\u2019m sorry, first one was in Newport, Connectic -- Newport, Rhode Island, yeah.

Still, 1t was either LA, Chicago or New York, Philadelphia area. So, when we left the camp, we had to go someplace, because we were under the quota and Yugoslav quota was not very large, like maybe six a year or something. But, I think my parents, because they were born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which at the time they were born, was under the Austro-Hungary empire, I think they put them under Austrian quota, which was much larger.

February, we had to leave the country, and we went to Canada. We went to Niagra, Niagra Falls, Canada, and then we crossed the bridge to United States.

They have, you know, allotment, but they\u2019re not sufficient to maintain oneself, especially this point. Well, my sisters were already getting older, you know. I mean, they -- they could go to work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s both sisters. Let\u2019s see, in 1950, no, my one sister would be -- \u201831, she was 19. No, 18, at that time, so she was working already, the -- the one next to me, but the youngest one was still in school. So, this is the sister that I mentioned to you that, pretty strong willed, and she, as soon as she started working, she says, \u201cWell, my money, the one -- the money that I earn, is mine.\u201d And she had problems with my father. He insisted that 1t was his. So they came up to some compromise, but still, not enough to maintain the family. You know, she was making like 25 dollars or so a week and she settled for contributing 15 maybe, you know. It -- Not maybe, but that\u2019s the number that I remember."

In fact, there were three brothers in this family and they lived in Philadelphia, not too far from me. And the oldest boy was a year older than me and the second one in line was year younger.

We maintained our friendship, then the second they - one of the -- middle brother of the three, he was accepted -- he was a pretty good student, he was accepted in what they call Central High, which is academically advanced - advanced school. In fact, you get a BA when you graduate from that high school. Anyway, and that was his future, he found friends, he developed different friendship. But the older brother, this fellow by name of Raymond Barney, he was a friend of mine from then on, I mean, from the camp and in Philadelphia, for a very long time.

We had a standing Saturday night date. But then, let\u2019s see, what happened, we broke up, I know. She went to -- to one of these resorts in the Catskill, she met somebody that was more serious than me, so that ended that. And then, in one of my summer evening classes, there was a bunch of girls -- this was Spanish class. I was trying to get some college credits in a hurry, so I would attend -- let\u2019s say I would attend advance college course, but they wouldn\u2019t give me credit unless I had some of the other preliminaries. So I would take an exam in the preliminary, pass that and have the advance course, which I had to sit for. And this was advanced Spanish. So sh-she saw I had a ring. It was a monogram ring that had turned itself around and she thought I was married, so she thought I was safe, nobody would say that, you know, that she was hitting on me, to use the current colloquial. And so she would come and sit like next to me and I won\u2019t say copy, but we would work the homework together. And it was a very happy group, like about eight girls and two guys and we would go after class, we go out, celebrate, or whatever. And that girl, when I decided to leave town, get a job someplace else, I left her, you know. And then one year I went to the mountains, the Catskills and lo and behold, we met again. And that was my wife for 30 years, and she passed away a year ago."

You know, they were not known for a-ad-advocating religious faith. So, at that point, the faith, because I was in the formative years, I had dropped some of my religious convictions and swung over to the other side, if you will. And then, in this camp in Oswego, well, we had the opportunity to practice our religion. But at that point, I was sort of rebelling and my father would force me -- of course, kids are forced to do their religious obligations, but -- and then after, when I started working in Philadelphia, I would go to services not as often as one should, but maybe once a month and for the high holidays.

            "answer": "Okay, well, no, the reason I didn\u2019t talk about, 1s because I didn\u2019t believe in victimization. I didn\u2019t want to center my life around history, memories and all that. Lots of people have adverse conditions in their earlier parts of their lives, and if they dwell on it and make their whole life based on their victimhood, if you will, then they\u2019re not going to be very functional.

When we came to Fort Ontario, when we started going to schools, what happened, they put us in a school with the rest of the kids. There was no issue, you know, you speak this language or you speak that language, so keep you separated. So, for awhile we just sat there, like bumps on the log, you know, not doing anything or not responding. But, it was sinking in and I remember like in the school where I went to, we had maybe about 16  kids from Fort Ontario. I was the first one that got on the dean\u2019s list, and that was within second -- well, the second report card period, and we had six each year, like three in the first semester, and three in the second -- every six or seven weeks. So, I got on the dean\u2019s list the first time. The very next time, was three of us, but the others were on the high ca -- high honors and I was still on the dean list. Next semester I got on the high honor list. It was like a competition, yeah. And the language was not a barrier, especially we excelled in English grammar, because there was no grammar to worry about, actually, whereas the kids that were born here, they struggled, they didn\u2019t know objective case from nominative case, whatever. We were familiar with other languages, which had much more complex grammatical structures. So, that and of course, many of us were a little bit older than the other kids. Not all, but I was older than others in my fir -- class, where I was first assigned. So, they kept promoting us, you know, social promotions, if you will. And the language was the easiest thing to absorb. That was not an issue. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then I would start saying, \u201cWell, how about if I mention South America and all that?\u201d Now, we were politically aware of what was going up, so this is like an introduction, so you can see what was in back of our minds. When the -- When the Negro movement started coming out, you said in \u201854, I was totally involved in my studies and you know, work full time and trying to take as many credit -- credit hours that I could at college, and there were too many things on my mind to get involved politically.

There was a lot of anti-Semitism by the Blacks at that time, and I -- there was a lot of Jews, young, you know, Jewish students that were participants, but what bothered me, that they never stood up and objected to the overt anti-Semitism by the quote, leadership of the -- this anti- Vietnam movement.

And it\u2019s funny, because the rabbi asked for a commitment from congregants. Any kind of commitment and he says, you know, it was like a -- it wasn\u2019t a fund-raiser, but says, \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to commit yourself to something, to tell you that you know who you are.\u201d So I said, \u201cOkay, attendance once a week of the religious services.\u201d And since then, we would bring our daughter to her school this -- on Saturday, anyway, we\u2019d stay for the service, and when the other girl was born, then we bring her when she was small, and we attended regularly and I don\u2019t think I missed one, even with This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were brought up differently. They had different religions, different scripts and different This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So they were not the same kind. Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came from the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls and agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these people. Divide and conquer, it\u2019s a old expression and it\u2019s -- it was true. So Germany and through Austria, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and the Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so there was -- the conflict was being raised. They were supported -- Serbia was supported by Russia, of course, because that\u2019s the big brother, Russia, and was supported also by France and England. So there was that inner conflict. Now, what we call Bosnia today, actually it\u2019s Bosnia and Herzegovina -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part. Anyway, these were just two little provinces. As far as I know, they never had a political autonomy. And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro Hungarian empire. At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro Hungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods. Anyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the outside powers. So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the supreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian authority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs, too. And that was in everybody\u2019s mind after the war. So Tito, when he became the leader of the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. And whatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. And he was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. He allowed anything that worked for him, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free ownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. But anyway, I knew when he would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn\u2019t build a natural succe-succession force. He did provide the mechanism, but no way to enforce it, because the control of the country was with the secret police and the army and he didn\u2019t have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was gone. But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians declared themselves independent, first 1t was Slovenia, and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection, if you will. And they were not successful, because they had to cross Croatia and Slovenia was in the mountains and it was not the most effective way of conducting a war. So Slovenia succeeded in seceding from Yugoslavia. Then when Croatia seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and they -- they took over the power. And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I want to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government, under this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. He\u2019s -- I guess he\u2019s a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of taking, let\u2019s say territory, they would just go there and destroy. Like, that was their way of discouraging, but not a very civilized way. But anyway, the Croatians were not very civilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that\u2019s all evil, it\u2019s all around and which one is This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But unfortunately for my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were there, we were in a position to pacify that area, we didn\u2019t do anything. In fact, whatever we did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker\u2019s rule. Jim Baker, he was George Bush\u2019s Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was acting in that position. So, I didn\u2019t like what was going on. Libya and Iran were sending arms to Bosnians, to the Moslem side and of course, they had no way to get the arms through, except through American controlled areas. So we just let them and the Croatians would take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. And that encouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. And I think we picked the wrong side in that conflict. We could have pacified it, we didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s my viewpoint."

            "answer": "Okay, the kind of life that my sister had under the Communist regime was not pleasant. Number one, when they were -- she uses the term demobilized, after the end of the struggle, she came home to Split. Of course, everything that we ow -- had owned, was taken, but she was able to find out where some of the furnishings were, like the bedroom set and the dining room and the, you know, just the furniture. And she tried to recover that and they were giving her a hard time. The government was not very friendly toward the Jewish returnees, if you will.

Either -- Well, I don\u2019t know if anybody who listens to this, whether they remember what happened when the Jews tried to come back from the concentration camps. In Poland, they would be attacked and many would die and all that. So, the anti-Semitism was rampant, just as much after the war as it was during the war, except now it was not under the approval of the state, but just -- the state would sort of turn away, or wink, or whatever. So, it was difficult. She used to tell us how she had different problems trying to reclaim this. And then finally, she went to court and very unsympathetic. No, it was very uns-unsympathetic government and when she did get it, it had the -- the furniture had degenerated to a point that it wasn\u2019t worth anything, so it was dumped. And she didn\u2019t have any means of support. She lived with her uncle, who was a barber and she -- there was an aunt that came from Fort Ontario, went back. She lived with them also. And they were very poor. The life was difficult for everybody after the war, but especially for her and she was by herself, there was nobody there. And we suggested several times that she should try to come and we could try -- work on it, but either we were not energetic enough or she was not enthusiastic enough, so nothing was ever done. Then she met a young man and she wanted to marry him and we were opposed to that, because of religious differences.
