wasn’t my first choice. Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician, but since being
Jewish it was impossible to get to medical school in Warsaw. I even mentioned to
my parents that I would like to go to France, but my parents were old fashioned and
the idea of a girl going to France didn’t appeal to them. Could be if I would really
fight, and wanted very much, I would go, but the upbringing was totally different
than it is now of young people. And I was two years in law school, which I didn’t
finish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which
appealed to me. And then for a — before the war started, I was helping my father in
his factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to
get excited. And then the war started —
Q: Okay, let’s talk a little bit more about your home. Did you live in the town,
within the town center?
A: In —1n the city of Warsaw I was living, we had a very nice, comfortable
apartment. I had the room which I share with my sister, which I adore. She paints
my life with roses. She was the best person before I met my husband, in my entire
life.
Q: And what was her name?
A: Edith. Edith, Esfia(ph).
Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood, or —

A: It was a Jewish — not a goo — not a nice neighborhood. I would say too, except
the janitor, hundred percent people were Jewish. Had three courts. The name of the
street was Simonhof(ph) 13. It wasn’t a nice neighborhood.
Q: Why? In what sense?
A: Why? The streets were narrow, the people — the stores were ugly. Everything was
—1if anybody knows Warsaw, they know that it wasn’t a nice neighborhood. I was
walking to school, we had always a housekeeper and we’re going for vacation, I
went to camp. And I went even before the war to Latvia to see my father’s family,
my grandmother, which I hardly knew, my aunts and uncles and cousins. And I had
many, many friends and it was a nice, quiet life, I would say. I didn’t know any
better.
Q: Were your friends Jewish children?
A: Majority of them were Jewish. As I say, except the janitor and the housekeeper,
everybody was Jewish.
Q: And at school were your other classmates all Jewish also?
A: This was a Jewish private school. However, my first encounter was in law
school, where, you know, it was a slogan, down with Jews. But the Jewish girls were

witnessed when they were cutting with the blades, the coats from the Jewish
students, it was winter. Do you know what I am talking about?
Q: Well, you want to tell us a little bit more about that? Who was doing it?
A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewish students. I went to University of Joseph
Pilsudski, which was — at this time he was dead, because he died when I graduate
my gymnasium. And the hatred, there were many things which couldn’t — Jews
couldn’t get. The majority of Jews who wanted to be physicians went to Italy, to
France, to Czechoslovakia. And they tried everything, although some of them were
very poor and it was very hard to support themselves overseas, but they were
working as waiters and some help from the parents. However, since I was accepted
to law school, and in the beginning I thought maybe I’Il be a law-lawyer, and —
however when the instructor professor was coming to the class and you know, the
Jews were sit — standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will
not sit on the left hand side, I will not start the lecture. And he was leaving, and this
was right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up
immediately the Jewish male students. The women they didn’t touch. And many
times when I was walking on the street in Warsaw, in so called mixed
neighborhood [indecipherable] Christian, I saw men who were attacked by young
Christian boys.

A: —I didn’t have any contact exactly, I didn’t have any Christian friends. I — so 1-I —
I was very limited because I was living in a ghetto, you know, yeah. I was going to
shows, and we went to opera. I remember “Madame Butterfly” was a Japanese
song — singstress — sa— woman who was singing. And however my direct contact,
so different from my husband, who went to a state school, was totally different.
Some of our teachers in my gymnasium were Christian, however, it was a different
relation.
Q: How religious was your family?
A: My mother was a believer, my father wasn’t. He — Friday within — my mother
was lighting candles, but my father was never there because he was working
Saturday. The business was open on Saturday and Sunday he was off. And my
mother was kosher — the home was kosher, however, my father outside was eating
not kosher. And I was not believing at all, and my mother was always very upset
because she couldn’t understand why I cannot believe it. However, came a moment
in her life when we’re thrown out — during the ghetto, from our apartment and we’re

the trains were loading the Jews, and the Jews were going to the trains with the
name of God [indecipherable] I heard this, I remember. And she said, children,
don’t believe in God. And I will never forget this because it was coming from a
woman who was so blindly believing in God that if the hole would open in front of
me, and I will go in, it would be less than to hear from my mother that there was no
God.
Q: Did you have any Jewish schooling?
A: No.
Q: Any training?
A: No. I don’t know how to —I understand Yiddish, and now when I am working
with Russian refugees, they are very happy when they hear. My Yiddish 1s very
poor, but I can manage very nicely. And they getting much better rapport than to —
through translator, which I always have. And since I’m Polish, I understand Russian
too.
Q: What language did you speak at home?
A: Polish. And I was angry at my par — at my mother that she didn’t speak, I was
ashamed a little bit that she didn’t speak a perfect Polish. However, when we came

talking Spanish? In her eyes it was that I was talking Spanish.
Q: What were your parents’ names?
A: Maria and Samuel Ma-Magitte(ph)
Q: And what kind of work did your father do?
A: My father had a factory, dyeing factory, where he employed 50 people. It was in
his building, he had few of the real estate. He was dyeing wool, silk,
[indecipherable], rayon, felt, feathers, everything possible. And he had this — he
came to Poland before the first war in 1914, I think, and he built up to — he was a
very comfortable man.

Q: Upper middle class.
A: Yeah.
Q: Mm-hm. Why did you want to become a doctor?
A: I loved children and I wanted to be a pediatrician and I felt — although I think I
was wrong because I’m very poor with science, I am rather for humanities. And it
was glamorous and that’s what I ar — but 1 — I — most likely 1-1t — it was not a strong
wish, because I could go abroad, my father could support me.

this. They couldn’t survive. They were more and more dead body on the street in
Warsaw, especially children, who are dying with their genitals covered with those
garbage flies. It was awful. And I remember I was carrying in a packet stockings,
which I was taking to somebody, you know, I — it is very hard for — when you had to
run, there were people who were fixing this. So a kid grabbed the bag from my hand
and started to eat. They thought this is a brown bag, that this is food. It was getting
worse and worse, you know. The Gestapo and the Germans were beating up walking
on the street. You couldn’t cross the street. And the walls which they built, you
know, people were smuggling because there was still some getting food. Kids were
smuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying
a bread, or something. It — and less and less people were, because the trains to
Treblinka were going all the time. We didn’t know the Treblinka — some people
were even getting cards, come here because we are working and everything is fine.

wasn’t a heroine, you know. They helped me, you know, and they picked me up and
through the window, because the doors were locked. My sister heard that I was in
the train, she went to the other train. She was extr — extremely important to me. In
the same time, we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of
the train and we went back to the ghetto. And my father was sitting on the floor near
the door. He said, I knew that you will come back. We decided that we have to do
something to leave the ghetto because we didn’t have a chance. My father knew a
man, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who took over the management of his factory.
And through him we got false papers for my sister and for myself. I was looking
more like Christian than her, because the whole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes. You
know, they say [indecipherable] in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing. I was always
smiling and — and really, although — and my Polish and her Polish was excellent, and
this was extremely important. And we said — and it was very hard for her to move
around because she could be very easy recognized. So through this man he found
somebody, and she was sitting mostly inside. This was April, before the uprising.
Q: April 1943.

Q: That’s it? Oh — [tape break]
A: Going back to my life during — starting August first, where it was uprising, Polish
uprising in Warsaw. There was time where there was nothing to eat because
Warsaw was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa — Vistula river by Russia
there was no food coming in. All the horses were eaten up. This reminds me on the
revolution in France when they were eating rats and mice. There was — this was
Armia Ludowa and Armia Krajowa. This was one which was to the left and one
was to the right. The Armia Krajowa was very much against Jews. I was working
there as a clerical person for awhile —

Interview with Romana Koplewicz ~

Beginning Tape Two, Side A
A: — Jewish, and I was working in the building there, who belongs to well know
Emil Wedel, who was German descent, but he never declared himself as a German.
There was a — one of the best factory of chocolate which existed now, E. Wedel, w-
e-d-e-I. And I — the people were — for whom I was working as a maid were — had the
apartment in the same building and the ones, the soldiers who were fighting, the
Polish soldiers, not officially soldiers, but to defend Warsaw, they were cooking in
our court, this was barley and some kasha, and they were — supposedly told me that
it was a horse, but then we find out that it was a — a dog — a dachshund who belong
to a well known Polish writer, Maria Rodzewiczkofna, very hard name to
pronounce, r-0-d-z-e-w-i-c-z-k-o-f-n-a. And then, the second time they caught some
kids, I don’t know where, because the uprising started August first and it was til
October where the Polish people have to capitulate because the Germans by air were
throwing bombs and marching, occupying back the Warsaw which for a short time
was in Polish hands. And there it was a cat cooked together with all the ingredients.
When J ate this I didn't know, I didn’t get sick, but I was young, and actually it
didn’t matter what I was eating.
Q: When you found out.

A: When I found out, yeah. But then it was written a book by somebody, by a Polish
writer and she mentioned this [indecipherable] dog. I don’t know if the dog has a
name. But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food. One
of the — after the war, when we’re — I was working with my husband in Lodz and I
saw Mrs. Lempke(ph). This was the woman which — where I was working on my
last job on a maid. She didn't see me, and I said to my husband, you should hit her a
few times. And my husband said, she is a head taller than me, how can I do it? And
she wasn’t good to you, you survi — she wasn’t bad to you, you survive. So why —
why do you want me to harm her? I cannot do anything, right? And this was the end.
But I had a strange feeling that always I would — I-I would never go back to Poland,
never, never. Now we’re — financially we’re okay, that is out of question, but I
remember when we we’re struggling, I always used to say, if anybody would put a
million dollars under condition that we’ll go to Poland to visit, I wouldn’t go. I hate
everything that they did for us. And I hated that in a normal country like Denmark,
even French were — was a excellent underground, although they have their own
Gestapo, Maquis and in other countries you hear so many beautiful stories. And
that’s true that the nuns helped me, and there were other Polacks, but it is such a
small percentage. Well, a — mostly a — were — where we had th-three and a half
million Jews living in Poland, well before Germans enter Warsaw, the Polish

people already was beating us up. The — before the war, you know, the — there was
tremendous hatred always. And I am sorry that I was born in Poland, not here. Joe?
Q: Any other —
A: Do you want —
Q: — stories that you remember, that you would like to add, any other —
A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, and I was 20 years old in 1939, and looking
back, you know, maybe I didn’t know any better. However, when I think — when I
got my — graduated gymnasium, I thought that I would conquer the world. I had so
many dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn’t realize, maybe because I was
stupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland.
They were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street. The
doctors, if they didn’t marry the rich girl, he couldn’t open the office. Lawyers, the
bar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew
couldn’t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn’t get a city job. And now living here
for 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybody can have, I am for sure
reinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us. And I see how people are
coming from different country, working in my capacity, what the help they getting,
what the chances they have to be somebody, to develop, to educate. To compare to
