My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, \"First Person.\"\nThank you for joining us today. We are in our 16th year of the \"First Person\" program. Our \"First\nPerson\" today is Mr. P\u00e9ter Gorog, whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2015 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We are grateful\nfor their sponsorship.\n\"First Person\" is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share\nwith us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our \"First Person\"\nguests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through mid-August.\nThe museum's website, at www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming \"First\nPerson\" guests.\nAnyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can complete the\nStay Connected card that you will find in their program or speak with a museum representative at the\nback of the theater. In doing so, you will also receive an electronic copy of P\u00e9ter Gorog's biography\nso that you can remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.\nPeter will share his \"First Person\" account of his experience during the Holocaust and as a\nsurvivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, there will be an opportunity for you to ask P\u00e9ter some\nquestions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Peter is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.\nPeter Gorog was born in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, in March, 1941 as P\u00e9ter\nGrunwald. He changed his family name in 1962 to Gorog. The arrow on this map of Europe points to\nHungary. on this next map, the arrow points to Budapest.\nPeter's father, Arpad Grunwald, worked as office manager at a Publishing House, while his\nmother, Olga Schonfeld,was a hat maker and she raised Peter. This was the last picture of the family\ntogether. Peter was 3 months old.\nPeter's father was conscripted to work in the\nHungarian Forced Labor Battalion.here is a photo of the Forced Labor Battalion. The arrow\nto the left points to P\u00e9ter's father, Arpad.\nAround December of 1942 Peter's father was taken to Ukraine where he died.Pe\u00e9ter and his\nmother remained in Budapest during in time. In 1944 German forces invaded Hungary. Peter and\nhis mother were evicted from their apartment and went into hiding with a Christian family. A few\ndays later a neighbor denounced them, the Hungarian gendarmerie arrested Peter's mother and put\nher in jail. This is a historic photograph from October 1944 of Jewish women in Budapest arrested\nby Hungarian police.\nTwo days after her arrest, Peter's mother escaped and she and Peter moved into an\napartment safeguarded by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. Later they fled to the Budapest\nghetto where they lived with some of the Peter's other relatives until the end of the war. In\nJanuary 1945, Budapest was liberated by the Soviet Army.\nIn 1946, P\u00e9ter's mother made plans for them to emmigrate to the United States. While in49 while they were waiting for their Visa, the Communist government from Hungary closed the\nborders. Peter grew up in Hungary.\nIn 1980, P\u00e9ter defected to the United States. He worked for more than 30 years at NASA's\nGoddard space flight center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Although Peter's mother had attempted to\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nemigrate after the war, they were unable to leave until his defection in 1980. While in Hungary,\nPeter was eventually able to attend University and he earned a master's degree in electrical\nengineering. He was part of the team that built the first computer designed completely by\nHungarians. His education and experience made it possible for P\u00e9ter to remain and work in the U.S.\nfollowing his defection until he received his green card and later became a U.S. citizen.\nPeter who retired in 2014 spent 34 years in the computer field in the U.S., spending most of\nhis time, as | said, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where he worked on major projects as\nLANDSAT\nThe Hubble Space Telescope, the Space Shuttle, and the James Webb Telescope, which is\nto be launched in 2018.\nFollowing his retirement last year, Peter became more actively involved with this Museum and\nbegan volunteering here. He translates documents written in Hungarian and video testimonies of\nHolocaust survivors and eyewitnesses. He describes his work as \"very emotional.\"\nPeter and his wife Jorgy live in Maryland just outside of Washington, DC. They have four\ndaughters, Sarah, Laura, Anna, and Ilana. They lost their daughter Juliana when she was just two\nyears old. Peter's daughter, Veronika, from his earlier marriage in Hungary, lives in Northern Virginia\nwith her husband and her two daughters Monica, age 7 and Katalina age 5. They are a very\nclose-knit family.\n| am pleased to let you know that Peter is accompanied today by Jorgy and their daughters\nLaura, Anna, Ilana, and Laura's husband Robert Walburn.\nlf you wouldn't mind, raise your hand so you know where you are right you down there.\nThank you.\nPeter is just now beginning to speak publicly about his Holocaust experience having\npreviously spoken only at his children's schools.\nWith that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, P\u00e9ter Gorog.\n(applause).\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Thank you.\n>> Bill Benson: Peter, thank you so much for joining us. For you to be our \"First Person\"\ntoday, you have so much to share with us so we will start right away. World War II began, of course,\nwith Germany and Russia invading Poland until September 1939. Before you turn to the war years\nand the Holocaust, tell us a little bit first about your family and their life before the war.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Let me give just a little historical perspective. | won't go back 2,000 years\nbut maybe 100, 150. In the mid 18th century, the Jewish population of Hungary enjoyed the\nfreedom, actually so much so that many Jews from other parts of Europe fled to Hungary.\nAnd this was the nature of Hungarian Judaism lasted until the First World War when\neverything ended. Unfortunately Hungary was under the losing side of the war. Hungary lost about% of their territory and 3,000 Hungarians ended up beyond the Hungarian border which caused\ntremendous stress and trouble for Hungarians in general and for Jews specifically.\nMy parents were born in 1907, both of them. They were born into Jewish families. My father\nwas born into a (inaudible) Jewish family. It is very similar to conservative Judaism. Here it is more\nliberal than the conservative one.\nMy mother was born into a very Orthodox family. My great grandfather was a rabbi in a small\ntown in Hungary that is now part of Slovakia.\nThey agree up in a family, here we would call middle class families. They went to high\nschool. My father, he aspired to be a lawyer. Unfortunately he wasn't able to fulfill his dream\nbecause after the war in Hungary, they enacted a law which was the very first anti-Jewish law in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nEurope even before the famous Nuremberg laws which restricted the participation of Jews in higher\neducation to the percentage of the general population which was about 5%.\n>> Bill Benson: So no more than 5% of the law school student body could be Jewish?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: That's correct. And unfortunately my father never got into the University or\nlaw school.\nMy mom, she was always good with her hands. She was a very smart woman. But she didn't\nwant to go to college or university. So she went to trade school and she became a hat maker,\nmilliner. Which was very fashionable during the '20s and '30s and she made a very good living.\n>> Bill Benson: You described to me that she was sort of the black sheep of her family.\n>> Peter Gorog: | didn't know that it was going to come up.\n(laughter).\nYes. In a way, she was, as | said -- she grew up in a very Orthodox family. They kept all the\ndietary laws. And among the customs were that Jewish women before their wedding, they go\nthrough a ritual bath. And my mom went to hers the day before the wedding, not remembering or\nthinking about that in the morning of the wedding she has to go to this ritual bath where she was\nimmersed in the water all the way down. And she had to go do it over again.\n>> Bill Benson: Do it over again.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: But she observed Jewish laws but not as much as her siblings | came to\nknow. It had an effect on me as | grew up and | was searching for my identity.\n>> Bill Benson: Peter, how large of an extended family did you have?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: My mom had eight siblings. Of the eight ones survived the Holocaust, two\nemigrated to the United States just before the war. My mom and two of my aunts. The rest of them,\none died of sickness even before the war. And the rest of them died after the Holocaust.\nOn my father's side, unfortunately, | don't have a lot to say about them because my father\ndied in 1942. So one of his brothers -- two of his brothers, one survived but the family just lost the\nconnection during and after the Holocaust with them.\n>> Bill Benson: Before the war began, | think you told me your father eventually joined your\nmother in the business. Is that right?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yeah. That's correct. He was a clerk in a publishing company. They\nthought maybe the hat-making business would be good for them working together. And my father\nstarted to study hat making, believe it or not. And he was very good at it. But that never came to\nfruition either because at the end of 1940, even before | was born, he was taken to the Forced Labor\nBattalion.\n>> Bill Benson: Peter, of course, the war began in 1939 September. But the full brunt of the\nwar and the mass deportation of Jews from Hungary didn't really get underway until 1944.\nNonetheless, conditions worsened for Jews in 1939 and got increasingly worse for your family and\nother Jews in Hungary from then on. And then, of course, as you said, your father was taken for\nforced labor in 1940.\nTell us what you can about the circumstances for you and your family once the war began\nand then about your father being conscripted into the Labor Battalion.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: My parents got married in 1936, and | was born in 1941. My father was\ntaken to the forced labor camp at the end of 1940, before | was born. He was released for two\nweeks after my birth. And that picture was taken during that time.\n| obviously don't have personal memories, but | know about Hungarian history. | know about\nthe anti-Jewish laws they enacted starting from 1938 where they restricted the number of Jews who\ncould work even at private companies. No government jobs for Jews. Actually the numbers were\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nrestricted in many professions, lawyers, doctors. They couldn't be editors of newspapers or any\nmedia.\nLater on, they enacted operational laws just like the Nuremberg laws in Germany, namely that\neverybody was qualified as Jewish whose at least one grandparent was Jewish which caused a lot\nof problem and caused a lot of lies because it is part of the Hungarian history that Hungarian Jews\nstart to assimilate as much as they could. They changed their German surname to Hungarian\nsurname as | did later on.\nThey did actually voluntarily converted to Christianity. So when the war came and all these\nJewish laws -- Jewish males between age 18 to 50 were taken to forced labor camps, these people\ntried to prove that they were not Jewish and they submitted all kinds of petitions to the government to\ndeclare them Christians. Some of them were born into families which were already converted to\nChristianity. So they were baptized in churches, and they had their baptism certificates.\nNevertheless, it didn't save their lives.\nThe reason | know it, I'm working with documents in the archives where these petitions are\nstored. And I'm translating them. And through the petitions, there is a stamp that says \"rejected,\nrejected, rejected.\" Knowing what happens to these people, it is a very hard thing.\nThat's why as our family's concerned, my father went to a forced labor camp. My mom\nworked as hard as she could.\n>> Bill Benson: She was able to continue her work during that time?\n>> Peter Gorog: That's correct.\n>> Bill Benson: Okay.\n>> Peter Gorog: And actually she could even afford to hire a maid who took care of me while\nshe was working. This one didn't last long either because another law came out which prohibited\nnon-Jewish people to work for Jews. This one affected my mom obviously and also affected a\nyoung girl from a village who lost her job and her livelihood.\nMy mom had to cope with the situation as much as possible.\n>> Bill Benson: Did she know where your father was when he was taken for forced labor?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yes and no. My father was able to send postcards. The postcards were\nobviously censored and they didn't let him write anything about the circumstances where he was.\nSo | can only follow his movement from the Hungarian archives where his battalion was\nrecorded from time to time. So unfortunately | do know that my mom didn't know much about him\nbecause at one point, after | was born, my mom started to write a diary. She wanted to remember\neverything which happened to her and happened to me so at the time when she hoped that my\nfather would return she would be able to recount the family history. Fortunately she preserved that\ndiary. And I'm in the process of translating it. And if the museum needs it, | would donate it.\nMy mom also preserved all the cards my father sent back from the forced labor camps. So\nwe have a glimpse of their life, what it was at that time.\n>> Bill Benson: And you actually have all the postcards, including what you think is the very\nlast one that he was -- he sent to her?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yes, | do have. And if time permits, | will just give you a glimpse of what\nhappened to them at that time. This is the card, the last one my mom got. It's dated 1942\nDecember 10.\nAnd just a couple of quotes from the card, if | may.\n>> Bill Benson: While you're looking for that, | was struck by how neat and small your father's\nhandwriting was.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: You can see obviously he had to jam as much information as possible. And\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nit's interesting, | didn't notice that aspect of the card.\n| will have a little problem with Hungarian terms of endearment, translating them because they\nmight not come out well in English. But stay with me.\nMy dear little squirrel -- (laughter) -- my golden little P\u00e9ter, he wrote the card to both of us. |\ngot your cards and they caused me great pleasure and | ask you to write as often as possible\nbecause every line is a very special holiday for me. Your cards are full of longing for me. And can\nyou imagine how much | long for you and for our home. But for the time being, we have to be very\npatient. We have to wait and trusting the good Lord. | cannot emphasize how much you have to\ntake care of your half.\nAnd then she goes on and on. And the last two paragraphs -- and that was the last two lines\nmy mom read from him: | wish you a Happy New Year, a better one than the old one. | hope that\nthe boys are doing well. And | send my kisses to the ladies. Those are the wives of the friends. To\ndear P\u00e9ter from Arpad who loves you a lot.\n>> Bill Benson: Thanks for reading that for us, Peter.\nKnowing because they were censored and you couldn't know actually a lot about what his\ncircumstances were like, generally what were they forced to do when they went to these Forced\nLabor Battalions? What were their work conditions like?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Well, what we know about them for those who survived and eyewitnesses\nand documents, they had very hard lives. They were so-called (inaudible) units for the regular Army.\nAnd they had to do all the dirty work for the Army. They were the ones that had to dig the ditches, to\nbuild roads, to clean buildings. And they were the ones who once they got to Ukraine, Hungary\njoined the Nazi Germany in the invasion of the Soviet Union number 1941. The Hungarian Army and\nthe Forced Labor Battalions were taken to Ukraine. And they were the ones who were forced to\nwalk through the mine fields before the regular troops just to make sure there are no more\nammunitions there. And some of them lost their lives by doing that.\nThey were under (inaudible) because they had the regular Army got first and whatever left\nover they had, that went to the forced labor camp.\nAlso, during the brutal Russian winter, they -- some of them had regular clothes when they\nhad to march and they had to march a lot. Those who were weak, they just followed the line. And\nthey either left them there or they shot them so they don't have to suffer any longer.\nThey were treated by the Hungarian officers very brutally also. They were slave laborers.\nThat's what | can tell.\n>> Bill Benson: Your last postcard is December 1942. When did your mother learn about\nyour father's death?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Well, she did not learn -- well, she was notified by the Hungarian\ngovernment with an official form which came later on in her life that was an official notification that\nmy father disappeared during the wartime activities in Ukraine sometime in February 1943.\nMy mom got the last postcard from the camp from a mutual friend who notified -- or told her\nthat he hasn't heard from my father and many of the friends who were in the same battalion since\nFebruary. And this card was dated in April. So the most likely time of his disappearance, his death,\nis February 1943.\nFrom the diaries | have, | got the sense that she didn't believe this news. She hoped and\nhoped that maybe my father survived and he was taken by the Russians as prisoner of war and sent\nto Siberia which wasn't a pleasant place to be. Nevertheless, my mom hoped he would return.\nUnfortunately he didn't, just like the 40,000 other forced laborers of the 100,000 that were\ntaken to Ukraine during the war. So 40% of them never returned. Some of them really were taken\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nas prisoners of war, and they were released after the war in 1946, 1947.\n>> Bill Benson: P\u00e9ter, so with the loss of your father, your mother would continue to care for\nyou and do all she could to protect you until -- and these conditions as awful as they were, things\nturned dramatically, profoundly worse in March 1944 when the Nazis occupied Hungary.\nTell us what changed so dramatically and what that meant for you and your mother.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: The situation for Jews were increasing even before March 1944 when the\nGerman troops marched into Hungary and actually occupied Hungary. Restrictions became stricter\nand stricter. They had to forfeit their valuables. There was an order that Jewish families had to give\ntheir jewelry over to the banks. They got a receipt that the bank took it for, quote-unquote,\nsafekeeping. But that was just the preparation for taking them away for good.\nFood was in short supply for everybody. It was rationed, but rationing was even worse for the\nJews who by that time were under curfew, not just during the night but during the day. They were\nallowed to leave their homes for a couple of hours a day to do their official business or do some kind\nof shopping.44 March, the German troops came in. The Hungarian government was still in charge.\nAnd the prime minister was more German friendly. Numerus Clausus laws were enacted. One\nwhich affected us was that Jewish people had to leave their homes and move either to the ghetto\nwhich was set up in mid 1944 in the traditional Jewish area of Budapest or certain designated\nhouses where Jews could live. These houses were marked with a yellow Star of David. The\nHungarian game is V\u00e9dett Haz marked by a star, and that's where most Jewish families moved to.\nMy mom, as | said earlier, she was a smart cookie. She knew moving to these houses or to the\nghetto would mark her forever for the next step. So she tried to go into hiding. She had a very close\nfriend, a Christian friend, and she was a Christian, not just a non-Jew in every sense of the word.\nAnd this family took us in for a couple of weeks until a neighbor reported us to the police.\nAnd one day the Hungarian gendarmerie which is a strange organization. It is somewhere\nbetween the Army and the police force. They had a very distinctive uniform. They had very\ndistinctive hats with a cock feather on it or two cock feathers. These are my first real memories, not\njust what my mother has told me from the diaries or the postcards.\nOne morning there was a knock on the door at the apartment where we stayed. And two of\nthe gendarmeries came in and took my mom away. | remember that we were around the breakfast\ntable. | was sitting on a chair with two big books on it because booster seats weren't available at that\ntime. And the families didn't have children, by the way.\nAnyway, my mom was taken away. | really didn't know what it meant. The family obviously\ntook care of me while my mom was away. And they encouraged me that my mom will come back,\nshe will come back. And she did because of her wit, because of her determination to survive and\nmake sure that | would survive.\nShe was taken to an infamous jail, infamous for many good reason in Budapest. The\nso-called (saying name) jail where people were collected, mostly Jews, just before they were taken\nto Auschwitz or the next concentration camp.\nWhen my mom got to the jail, she immediately started protesting that they arrested her\nagainst the law, that she was protected because she was a war widow.\nMy mom wasn't a war widow because only people who were part of the regular Hungarian\nArmy and who died, their wives were declared war widows. And there were certain privileges for war\nwidows. They got a portion -- when food was portioned, they got higher portions.\n>> Bill Benson: Higher rations.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Rations, sorry. And other privileges.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nMy mom wasn't a war widow because my father was taken to a forced labor camp with the\nArmy. So the official people | mentioned earlier which came from the Hungarian Ministry of Defense\nsaid that Arpad Griinwald disappeared blah, blah, blah here and here and there was a big stamp on\nit.\nThe guards were uneducated. Maybe they had four or five years of elementary school. At\nmost -- they couldn't even read what was on the paper but they saw the big stamp. So they thought\nthey did something wrong by arresting my mom. They went to the command, and he called my mom\nin. My mom told him also that I'm a war widow, you must let me out.\nHe couldn't read the document, but he couldn't figure it out. Or whatever the reason was,\nmaybe just divine Providence, he let her out.\n>> Bill Benson: So through her courage and just her quick thinking, she is able to get out of\nthere. And then -- now she's got to do what to do. You told me she then did another major act of\nchutzpah at that point.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yes. She came back to the apartment where | stayed. And obviously we\ncouldn't stay any longer because of all those good neighbors. My mom didn't want to try her luck\nagain.\nSo she called a friend of hers who ordered to live in the so-called protected houses.\nWhat happened in 1944 on the verge of the U.S. government and financial support of Jewish\norganization, a Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg went to Budapest for the very purpose of saving\nas many Jews as possible. What he did and some other mutual embassies in Budapest, they issued\nfalse passports. Actually, they weren't false passports. The passport was an original Swedish or\nSwiss passport, to Hungarians so they can prove that they are foreign citizens and they cannot be\narrested and persecuted.\nHe also bought up some apartment buildings which according to international law was under\nthe protection of the Swedish government and was treated as Swedish territory. No Hungarian\nauthorities could enter these houses without the permission of the Swedish embassy.\nAnd as many buildings as he could buy up, these buildings were in the ghetto. This was,\nquote-unquote, fancy part of Budapest where (inaudible) lived close to the Danube actually. And\npeople who moved to these houses were secure for a while because no Hungarians, no Germans\nentered into these buildings and could arrest. They could not take them away.\nSo my mom called this friend of hers who had this document, who already moved into an\napartment. And she told her that there was one three bedroom apartment which was by Hungarian\nstandards huge. And there were two families living only in the two bedrooms and there was another\none unoccupied. So my mom took me, one suitcase and these papers and the necessities and we\nmoved into one of these Wallenberg Houses.\nLife there was -- well, | was 3 1/2 years old. So if you ask me what | remember or what my\nmemory is, | was an ignorant little boy, did what little boys do. | didn't have the sense of terror and\nhorror what was going on outside the walls. And because of the love of my mom, that's the only\nthing | experienced. And that was enough for me.\nLife in those protected houses was relatively calm. The houses were surrounded by -- there\nwas a parliamentary military group party called the Hungarian Arrow Cross which in October 1944\nactually with a coup d'etat took over with the Germans and these people belonged to party and\nparliamentary group, were young people, 18 to 20 years old. They were in black uniform or black\nshirts and black trousers. And they were guarding these protected houses which meant that they\ncould not enter to the house without permission. They didn't have the permission. So we were safe.\nThis one changed overnight when the Arrow Cross took over the Hungarian government.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n>> Bill Benson: This was now probably October 1944?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: That's correct.\n>> Bill Benson: And if | might just interject for a moment, you had told me earlier that initially\nthe Hungarians and the Nazis had pretty much deported all of the Jews from the countryside. And\nnow their attention was focused on Budapest. And there had been an extraordinary number of\ndeportations. | think somewhere around 450,000 Auschwitz in about six weeks.\nThen it stopped until the coup d'etat in October. Now you had been protected up to that point.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yeah, that's correct. Historians and political parties are explaining the\nhistory of Hungary during the Second World War and during the Holocaust. And it is a history that's\nunfortunately more or less supported by the current government, that the Hungarians were not\ncomplacent in the extinction of the Hungary Jews. The facts are unfortunately different. When the\nGermans came in to Budapest with 600 of the so-called commando, | think that was the name,\npeople couldn't deport in two months, 400,000 Hungarian Jews from the Hungarian countryside.\nWhen you see the documents, when you visit the Web site of the Museum, you can see\nvideos of eyewitnesses and survivors. Hungarian Jews were arrested, were taken to ghettos set up\nin different cities as a first step of taking them to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.\nAll of this happened with the help of the official Hungarian police force and gendarmerie.\nThey were the one who took the properties and valuables of these people while they were deported.\nAs you said, they started at the countryside. 400,000 out of the 800,000 Hungarian Jews at\nthat time in the middle of the month ended up in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other places.\nBy September/October, they turned to Jews of Budapest, the remaining Jews of Budapest\nbecause, mind you, already many of them died or were in the forced labor camps.\nAlso, another sad fact of Hungarian history, when the Germans occupied Poland, they asked\nfor -- | don't Know exactly the Hungarian government to deport 15 or 18,000 Polish Jews who lived in\nHungary, many of them who were born in Hungary but they never gained Hungarian citizenship. So\nthey were still Polish citizens.\nThose 18,000 Polish Jews were forced to leave Hungary. They were transported to Ukraine\nwhere there was a camp, infamous camp where 50,000 out of the 80,000 Polish Hungarian Jews\nwere practically butchered and killed.\n>> Bill Benson: Peter, October 1944, you and your mom are still in the Wallenberg House\nprotected as much as possible. But all that changed very dramatically.\nTell us now what happened. Because from there you would be forced out, your mother would\nleave with you. Tell us what happened and then from there you went into the ghetto.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yeah, this time the new Hungarian government and the Arrow Cross, they\ncouldn't care about international law anymore. And they started to go into even the protected\nhouses. And Jewish people, Jewish families were sent away. As | said, these houses were very\nclose to the Danube. Most of them were marched down to the bank of the Danube. They were lined\nUp -\n>> Bill Benson: Taken out of the Wallenberg Houses?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: They were forced out of the Wallenberg Houses. They were taken to the\nbank of the Danube where they were shot. They fell in the river. They didn't have to care about\neven the dead bodies. Those who fell on the shore, they were thrown into the river. And they\nsystematically went through the houses and emptied the apartments one by one.\nOne day there was a knock on our door. And this Nazi -- Hungarian Nazi, thugs, came in and\ntold my mom to get out and line up in front of the building.\nOne of these young guys intervened, and he told to his comrades or colleagues that \"leave\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nthem alone, | Know them. She's the mom of little P\u00e9ter.\" He knew me by name. How did he know\nme by name? Because we had nothing better to do while we were in those houses. We were\nplaying in the inner courtyard of this apartment building. And what the little boys played, we played\nthe English translation would be police and robbers or something like that. Wwe made weapons out of\nbroomsticks and other junk.\nAnd we just shoot other boom, boom, puff, puff. And these thugs were sitting there in the\ndoorway of the house. He saw us -\n>> Bill Benson:They're watching to make sure you don't leave, they're watching you do this.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: That's correct.\nOne got this crazy idea that why don't you give them our own weapons and they can play with\nreal weapons.\nBeing 4 1/2 years old, we were excited about having -- (laughter) -- a real weapon.\nFortunately will, they were humane enough and they took out the ammunition. So we just aimed real\nweapons at each other and went boom, boom.\nSo we kind of got acquainted with each other. Some of them probably had little brothers at\nhome and they looked at us as will their little brothers, except we had the yellow stars on our coat.\nAnyway -\n>> Bill Benson: Spare this one family, this mom and son.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: That's correct. This is because we built what you call a relationship the\nprevious few days or few weeks. This relationship really saved our life for another day because we\ndidn't know who would come the next day.\nSo on that day, we left the protected houses and we moved into the Budapest ghetto which by\nthat time was built up around the great synagogue of Budapest, beautiful big building, completely\nrestored by now.\nThat was a traditional Jewish quarter of Budapest. According to Jewish customs, on Saturday\nyou walk into the synagogue. So there were synagogues in walking distance for everybody.\nThe ghetto was walled by that time. You could go -- or those who were permitted, could leave\nwith permission. That's where we lived.\nBy that time, that was October, November, December of 1944. Budapest was surrounded by\nthe Russian troops. They came from the east. They were chasing the Germans all the way back to\nGermany. By that time, they reached Budapest. Budapest was under attack. Air raids were daily\noccurrences.\nWe have to -- we had to go down to the basement of the apartment buildings. The way the\napartment buildings were built at that time was an unfinished basement with dirt floors. And there\nwere wooden stairs for every apartment where people stored a few of their wood they used for the\nfurnaces in the apartment.\nThat's where we stayed most of the time during this time. Even when the siren called the air\nraid off, there was no reason to go upstairs again because we just couldn't -- didn't know when we\nhave to come back.\n>> Bill Benson: And you told me that the shelling and bombing was just relentless. So you\nwere down in these basements with wooden floors -- | mean, dirt floors, the conditions were horrific.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: The conditions were horrific. | remember that we had a blanket on the floor.\nThat's where we sat and played. We ate if we had food. At that time, food was very scarce. Water\nwas not there most of the days. And we lived practically underground for 2 1/2 months.\nWhile we heard this bombing, again, for me, | didn't know what it meant. | didn't know that the\nhouse next to us were bombed and everybody died, even who were under the building. By luck, by\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\ndivine Providence, we were saved.\n>> Bill Benson: After being four months in those conditions, you were liberated by the\nRussians. Tell us what liberation meant.\n>> Peter Gorog: Well, liberation meant that we could take the yellow Star of David from our\ncoats. It meant that there was no daytime curfew. It meant that we could move back to our\napartment.\n| don't know if | mentioned, when we were forced to leave our apartment where my parents\nlive from 1936 to 1944, a German family moved in and took over the apartment. It was our luck that\nthey preserved practically everything, the furniture. | grew up with the same furniture my parents\nbought after they got married. Not many Jewish people were that lucky because unfortunately\nJewish properties were looted as soon as their families moved out, as soon as they had to give up\ntheir shops and businesses.\nSo getting back to normal was a different normal, what you would call normal today. But it\nwas something which resembled a normal life.\nWe moved back to our apartment. This family on their own willingly moved out so we had a\nplace to live. Food was still in short supply. Stores were empty. Other food was rationed. But you\ncouldn't even use your rationing teacup because there was no food. So what happened was that\npeople in the cities carried their valuables, jewelry, clothes, whatever they could barter and took the\ntrain to the nearby villages or some villages were not nearby. but their belonging for food, eggs,\nbread.\n>> Bill Benson: And your mom did that?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: My mom did. Because there was no nanny, she took me and | remember\ngoing to the railway station where the trains were so jammed that people were traveling on the top of\nthe train just to get out of the city and get some food.\n>> Bill Benson: And, Peter, when you were in the ghetto, you were in there with several other\nrelatives. | think several grandparents. Tell us what happened to them.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yes, we moved into my grandparents\u2019 apartment which was a one-bedroom\napartment which meant one bedroom, one family room, and a kitchen. And we were there with two\nof my aunts, my maternal grandparents, my mother and | and my cousin. That's where we lived.\nWe survived. My grandparents survived. They were not victims of the Holocaust in the sense they\nwere not killed during the time of Holocaust. But because of starvation, because of the lack of\nmedical facilities and opportunity. They died a couple of months after the war.\n>> Bill Benson: And you attribute that totally to how awful the circumstances, they just\ncouldn't survive after the war.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yeah, they were so weak, so malnourished that | think they had a common\ncold or something like that which caused them...\n>> Bill Benson: Did any other family members survive, P\u00e9ter?\n>> Peter Gorog: As | said, one of my uncles and my aunts left Hungary. My aunt left in 1938.\n>> Bill Benson: Before the war.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Before the war.\nMy Uncle Lester, he stayed in Hungary until 1941 where he was taken to a forced labor camp.\nHe was on leave and he never went back.\nHe was lucky enough to have entry to the United States because he was born what was then\npart of the Hungarian empire but by the time of the war, it was part of Czechoslovakia. So he was\non the Czech quota system which was relatively short. He was able to get an entry Visa.\nHe left Hungary, he followed through the Nazi-occupied Europe and he boarded the last ship\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nwhich left Lisbon to the United States.\n>> Bill Benson: To the U.S. And we won't be able to get into it, but he and your aunt became\nimportant to you when you came to the United States in 1980, if | remember correctly.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: That's correct. In 1980, | came with the excuse to visit them. | visited them,\nand | never returned to Hungary.\n>> Bill Benson: You decided to just stay.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: | decided to defect from Hungary and stay in the United States. And they\nwere instrumental in the first few months providing food and shelter and helping me to get used to\nAmerican life. As long as they lived, we stayed in close contact.\n>> Bill Benson: Let me ask you just a couple more questions, P\u00e9ter, before we close our\nprogram in just a few minutes.\nFrom the little bit you've been able to share with us, obviously you just touched the surface.\nBut it's clear that your mother was brave. She was smart. She was resilient. She was resourceful.\nBut that continued -- that didn't end with the war ending. She continued to do what she could to try\nto get you and her out of the circumstances you found yourselves in in Hungary. But she was not\nable to at that time get you out of the country.\nTell us a little bit about that.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Yeah in 1946, she decided we should leave Hungary. There was no future\nfor us. Her siblings lived in the United States. She applied for a visa, entry visa. She got her\nHungarian passport. You saw the pictures at the beginning from that passport.\nAnd while we were waiting for the Visa, the Hungarian government and the political system\nwere taken over by the Communists with the help of the occupying Russian forces. Hungarian\nborders were closed. Nobody in, nobody out. And so we were will stuck there. My mom was hired\nas a seamstress for the rest of her working life. Worked in two shifts. | hardly saw her most of the\ntime. But we always had food on the table. | always had clothes. And I'm very grateful.\n>> Bill Benson: And, Peter, the last question for you today is: You were planning to go back\nto Hungary because you'd really like to learn what you can about where your father was. Just say a\nlittle bit about that.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Really unfortunately | have no memory on my father's side. The only thing |\ncan do at this point to translate the cards and try to stitch together his life, the last two years of his\nlife is from the postcards and get documents from official Hungarian archives which would at least\ngive me some kind of history of his life.\n>> Bill Benson: Because today you really learned nothing more than you knew then about his\ncircumstances?\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: Well, obviously | learned a lot from my mom who shared a lot and\nfortunately about two years before my mom died, | did a video interview with her just about the\nHolocaust and family history. And that one is still waiting for transcript and translation for the rest of\nmy family. That's how it happened.\n>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn back to Peter in just a moment to close our program. And as\n| said, we only got a glimpse. Of course, what we are not hearing about is what Peter went through\nin the subsequent years, for the Hungarian revolt in 1956, the Prague spring in 1968 and his\ndecision to defect. You just heard a little bit about his career. But he's made these amazing\ncontributions to our nation since then.\nSo, Peter, thank you for being here. | want to thank all of you for being our audience today. |\nwant to remind you we will have a \"First Person\" program each Wednesday and Thursday until the\nmiddle of August. | hope you will be able to return at some point and join us.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nlt is our tradition at \"First Person\" that our \"First Person\" gets the last word. And before | turn\nto P\u00e9ter for the last word, I'd like to do a couple of things. One is when Peter's done, Joel, our\nphotographer, is going to come up on the stage. You saw those gorgeous photographs at the\nbeginning. He's going to come up here and take a picture of P\u00e9ter with you as the backdrop. So at\nthat point, I'm going to ask you to stand so we can get a picture of P\u00e9ter.\nAnd then Peter will stay on the stage. We didn't have time for you to ask him any questions.\nSo if you'd like to come up here on to the stage after we're done and ask him some questions or say\nhi or get your picture taken, please do that. Absolutely feel free to do that.\nSo on that note, I'll turn back to P\u00e9ter.\n>> P\u00e9ter Gorog: | wanted to close with a picture projected. Unfortunately because of\ntechnical difficulties, | couldn't. So you have to use your imagination. And also you can this over,\nyou can Google Hungarian Jews arriving to Auschwitz. In the picture, you would see Jewish people\njust embarking from the cattle cars. They were taken to Auschwitz after four or five days' trip. 60, 80\npeople in a cattle car lining up on the platform and waiting for something. They didn't know what\nthey were waiting for.\nYou can see the grim expression of mostly women and many children. During the Second\nWorld War, about will 1.5 million children died. Out of this 1.5 million were Jewish children. You can\nsee the Jewish children on this picture with the yellow stars completely oblivious what would happen\nIn the next 24, 48 hours.\nWhat happened was that they were gassed. They were cremated. And they are not with us\nanymore.\n| wrote to them and | wrote to the memory of my father and the many Jews who perished\nduring the Holocaust that this would never happen again. It is my responsibility to tell my story and\nthe story of the Holocaust. And it is everybody's story in this auditorium and outside this auditorium\nto make sure that this one will never happen again.\nThe Museum has a local mantra: Never again. What you do matters. And the \"you\" is in big\nbold letters you can see outside the building.\nWhat you do, what | do, what we all do matters, that the Holocaust will never happen again,\nnot to the Jewish people, not to the people in Sudan or Cambodia or Kosovo. Because unfortunately\n(saying name) did not learn from the Holocaust and the Holocaust since then. And it's our\nresponsibility to make sure that it will never happen again.\n(applause).\n(Program concluded at 12:05 p.m. ET).\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n",
