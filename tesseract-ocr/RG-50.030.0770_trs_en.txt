Interview with Barbara Syska ,
October 22, 2014
A: Bialystok was the center city for the county of Bialostocka(ph) Voivoidsfa(ph).
Voivoidsfa(ph) Bialostotsky(ph), that’s come from Bialystok. There was one
hospital at that time. I lived, for the first year, somewhere on the ci — in the city.
And when I was a year, or a year and a half, we moved to the part close to Palac
Branitsky, is Palace of Branitsky.
Q: And where’s that?
A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, so there was a fence between the one park
and the other. One was the school, which was just ordinary school with the school
for the teachers. The other was the ci-city of Bialystok where — where
magistrat(ph) is.
Q: Was municipal authorities?
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: And at that part there was also a big lake where we used to slide during the night
— du-during the winter.
Q: So it would be frozen over?
A: Why we moved to that part, which was the school, because my mother was a
teacher. Both of my parents has only education up to the matriculation.
Q: What does that mean, matriculation? High school, or some college?

A: Twelve. High school, high school.
Q: High school. Gymnasium, and so, yeah.
A: They didn’t have anything farther than that. So my mother was specialized in
teaching the teachers, and because of that, she was teaching e-even in high school,
the 10" and 11" — well, 13 grade. At that time the teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade.
Otherwise, she has only the right to teach up to the ninth — sixth grade, sorry. The
school was divided six grades, four grades and two top, and then you have the high
school.
Q: So your mother was a teacher. Was your father also a teacher?
A: No. He was the — they met in Wejherowa, it’s close to the sea. She was a
teacher and he wanted to be the soldier. And she convinced him to leave the army. I
have no idea what happened during the war on 20 for my father.
Q: In 1920.
A: Because he — in 1920, he was 22. So most likely he was in the army. They never
talk about that. The only thing my mother convince him to leave the army. And
because he was in the army before, he was the army reserve. So from time to time
he had to go and learn a bit more for a week or two. Otherwise, he was a clerk. A —
most likely he was an accountant. I didn’t know much about tt.
Q: I see.

A: And we lived in the buildings close to the palace.
Q: What’s a powets? What’s a powets?
A: Palace.
Q: Palace, okay.
A: Mm-hm. The buildings were built — when I visit after the war, the walls were
most likely close to a meter wide. So it was always warm, but of course for the
restroom we would have to go — share it with two other families and go downstairs
somewhere. There was no hot water, and things like that, because the building at
that time was already 150 years old.
Q: How was it that you lived in this palace?
A: Because my mother was teaching in the school. So we —
Q: And the school was located in the palace?
A: Yes.
Q: I see. Okay.
A: Oh, part of it.
Q: I see. I see.
A: And in the — there was a beautiful park, there were tennis courts, which are very,

town of industry for clothing.
Q: Textiles.
A: And every — textile. And everything went into that river, and vo — very small
river. It used to be called Biatka(ph). Right now they call it Bialy Rzeka — Rzeka
Bialy, which means White River. It was really nothing, it was smelly always, not
transparent, but no — nor — no animals, no nothing.
Q: So it’s polluted.
A: Enormously polluted. You can’t imagine.
Q: Even before the war?
A: Before the war. They were going to put it into underground. What they did
afterwards, I don’t know. I visited Bialystok only once from this country, and it
was completely different. Before the war, it was 104,000 people. And apparently
half of the population was Jewish. I thought it only about a third. Part of the poorest
part was Jewish, and they were all — also little shacks where they were selling every
— food and everything, so we would go there. And I’m sure that 1t was completely
burned while eur — when the Jewish people were fighting.
Q: I see, so —

experience, because when the war started, he had to go to the army, and with his
army, he was going back, back, back —
Q: Wait, excuse me, I’m going to interrupt. We’ll come to that point. I’d like to
leave the — the stories and the experiences about World War II to the side right now,
and concentrate on — on what — what was life like pre-war. And I have a few
questions already from what you were telling me, and they’re factual kinds of
questions.
A: One thing also.
Q: Sure.
A: My mother had a servant —
Q: Okay.
A: — who was taking care of me, and cooking, because she was a teacher. But she
was paying a lot. It we — the servant lived with us, and she was paying 25 zloty. If
you could somehow — I think that her monthly was 200, or something like that, her
moth — my mother’s. So —
Q: Your monthly — your mother’s monthly salary was 200 zloty?

property is divided equally, except if somebody goes to priesthood.
Q: Okay.
A: So they were pushing boys to priesthood so they would — and because of that,

Q: So, I got the impression — tell us again, there will be people who know
geographically where Bialystok is, and others who don’t. Can you tell us where in
Poland the city is?
A: It’s halfway from Warszawa to — you say Vilnius, I’m saying Wilno.
Q: So it’s halfway between Warsaw and Wilno, and Wilno is in Lithuania, so that

A: Beat the Jew. That — those were extremists, but hardly ever. And so that was not
showing what the population was. But we have, don’t buy in Jewish store. Last few
years we e — if we could avoid. And the reason was economic, because before
Poland received independence into ninet — 18 — Jewish people were taking part of
commerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food,
somebody had to bring into the city. And that was what Jewish people were doing.
Q: Okay.
A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very I-large. Out of 30 millions —
no, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish. Because
when in the western Europe in, I don’t know, 15" 16 century, when there were a
fight and they didn’t wan — like Jewish people, Jewish people came, and apparently
just past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of
Jewish people, because we accepted them. So that was only when Poland get the
independence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the — the
shopkeepers could not be only Jewish people. And because of that, Jewish people
were fighting the new stores. Of course, that was economic fight. The whole part of

the new Polish store — not Polish, Christian store. Jewish people were Polish people.
But they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper. After a

went up. That was known, and because of that we were, don’t buy in Jewish store.
But that was not anti-Semitism. This was justified of — as I said, the noblemen,
since they gi — were giving to every son, then they were poorer and poorer. That
was a cul — sort of culture. But —
Q: I want to — I— I want to go to — I understand what you are explaining, but I

A: I—I don’t know, but I knew some things [indecipherable] that they had to wash
the — all the dishes somewhere. So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And
of course, my parents were very much against us. That was just before the war,
there were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were
saying that it’s — it was completely silly. When we had to, during the war, under the
Russian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw, to German — Germany
[indecipherable]. So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave
my mother a sign that my mother has a weak — weak heart, and have to stay at home
for three weeks. That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw,
and she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again. Of
course, that was something what she — it was be punished by whatever, maybe
sending to Siberia. But she gave it to my mother. So —
Q: And she was a Jewish lady?
A: She was Jewish, yes.
Q: Yes, I see.
A: And also we have a doctor, h-he was Jewish. When we started to buy only in
Christian stores, we didn’t change him. So, it was a Jewish doctor. So I really

but in Poland it was not strong.

people were saying that if that one doctor there would cut the leg off, the person
would die for sure. It was a horrible thing. When the war started, all the stores had

Q: Yes.
A: And at the end of that, Germans wanted to get rid of us, so they said, we are not
bandits, we’re soldiers. And from that on, Germans treated us properly, definitely
properly, because we were in Sandbostel, somewheres and somewhere else. And
my father, from that camp went to Murnau, where is only for officers —
Q: Okay.
A: — also. And I don’t remember, but I think it was before the Christmas that we
were sent to Oberlangen. Oberlangen is close to border of Holland, with empty
space all around us. And they sent one after another, they sent women from other
prisoners of war, which was definitely very safer for us. My father said that in
Sandbostel they were — Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed, they will
try to go at any place to our camp, our —
Q: Area.
A: — area, because there are men who are four or five years without women. So
Germans took all the women. Before that they ask who wants to work in th — in the
country, or something. I think 1t was volunteer everywhere, that m-maybe there was
pressure on women, but definitely not pressure on the — physical pressure. No, not
physical pressure, psychological pressure. Because a lot of women from the
prisoner of camp went to work somewhere. But we went, just sent to that one camp.

Q: I want to interrupt you just for a second, just so that we have the chronology
right. The uprising starts on August 1“, 1944, correct?
A: Yes.
Q: It lasts for 63 days, which means that by early October it has been quashed, at
which point you’re taken prisoner —
A: Yes.
Q: — and your mother is taken prisoner, and your father is taken prisoner.
A: Yes.
Q: Were you together at the time, all three of you, or were you separated?
A: For a day or two we were together. We were marched, I think about 20
kilometers to Ozarow, and then in a very big camp, and then men was separated
from women.
Q: And then you were —
A: But we were taken as ordinary soldiers, already.
Q: And so then you were put on cattle cars, is that right, on trains to go to
Sandbostel’?
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s not comfortable, but is nothing.

Q: So, when you get to Sandbostel, you are there for how long?
A: Most likely before Christmas, but I’m not sure whether it before or after
Christmas. Then we were taken to Oberlangen, which was an empty space —
Q: Yes.
A: — with only us.
Q: Only women.
A: Only women, from a different camp. I was in the second barrack.
Q: And your — and this was still done by the Germans together, and this was done —
did you know why they did this? What was the reasoning?
A: Why they took all the women together?
Q: And — yeah, and put them together?
A: I’m thinking because they thought that it was safer. They was done properly.
Q: I see.
A: And we were even received three — three times I think, a parcel from Red Cross.
On-Only three, usually it would be more, food or something. Once they sent
hygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo — well, we had the little
hospital there, for us, and so it was useful. But, more than half of women did not

A: Not only stress, hunger.
Q: Oh.
A: We were given food, but Germans didn’t have much of that. We had to work in
the kitchen for ourselves, so that’s all again — according to a Geneva Convention.
Q: Okay.
A: I cannot say that — somebody once said that it was a special camp or something.
It was the proper camp, they treated us properly. We had to go out to bring the
potatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they ask me very often, what is in this soup?
And I would say that the soup is with salt, or without. Sometimes they didn’t have
salt. I cannot say more salty or less, but salt, or without salt, I could smell it at that
time. So they always ask me, I never made the mistake. So you see —
Q: That’s amazing.
A: — it was so little —
Q: Yeah.
A: — that — that — well, we were doing everything. We could do during the day
whatever we wanted to. The restroom were outside, of course, not inside. And in
one empty hut there was water broken, and even the winter there, it was flowing
there, so we would go there, or something like that.

huts, and only four or five were occupied. Altogether we were close to 2,000, I

plank. And so sometimes it was difficult to sleep, no, not to fall down, because on

anything, we learn history. I started to learn — I-I started to learn English before that,
but we had one book. It was [indecipherable] something like that, it — a some book
on lowest level, about some murder or something like that.
Q: Like a detective novel or something?
A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from
somebody who knew that, were on much better progress, so I was learning what is
here, there, at, and things like that.
Q: So they were learning English from the detective novel?
A: Yes, because we had that detective novel. And it’s still — in Sandbostel we used
to walk up and down the corridor there. There we were 1n such a crowd that when
we were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to
turn around. But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night,
but during the day. And I and two other girls who were learning English — English
was not popular in before the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to
learn later, but wasn’t popular. But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish
sentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget. But then in
Oberlangen it was already something like that. And of course if we were bored,

A: — but somebody sick maybe, we could stand for two or three hours. But that’s the
usual in camp. Opposite us, opposite this four or five huts, were the others, and
there was that little hospital, which we had for — and also, during that morning and
evening —

Q: Prisoner of war, too, okay.
A: They were, definitely.
Q: Okay.
A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel. We knew they were
Jewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It’s a some sort of accent, I don’t know
whether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and
the best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better
pronunciation that others. But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent
which we could recognize. They definitely had, and the older one looked like
Jewish girl. So — with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of
course, because we never knew whether they — even as prisoner of war, whether
they would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was
about 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.
And she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to
people [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where
to go if she mistake it. And she could not read, so she was putting the messages in
between her fingers to remember to whom she has to go and show, if she ge-get
more.

early days of the ghetto.
A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto.
Q: Okay.
A: I don’t remember next to Zelazna where I was walking, whether that was big or
little one, right. And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people
could go from one ghetto to another over that. And that was — now, one of them, the
one which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don’t
remember. And then I was walking — we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew
that they cannot survive, nothing will — there was a Polish underground and Jewish
underground, there were some connection, but we didn’t have a lot of ammunition

were dying there. But on the very beginning, on that — that other ghetto, other part
was fighting and this one not. When I was going through Zelazna street, and over

talking to somebody with — it couldn’t — you couldn’t say joy, I — I don’t have the
word for that. But I was horrified. How could she be so calm, when she 1s going to
die pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand
that she was proud. She knew what’s waiting for her, and I s — I still can see her
how it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that — that they fighting and not —
not allowing to be martyred by — by themselves. It — it give me a — an impression,

A: A few weeks or months later, my father — I used to go by streetcar next to all get
— the ghetto was always closed to us, afterwards as well. There was streetcar, and he
said, don’t go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put — hung some
people and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people
there. So Germans weren’t nice to us. And we learn only that during the

high position in — in the army. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are
close to Wilno, people were saying we’re Armia Kryova. At first they were treated
nicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we

there was some background noise. I was asking you, did you know of — of
transports of Jews outside of the ghetto, while you were in Warsaw proper. What
was happening to them?

starting, some couple which were Christian and Russian — and Jewish, they could
choose the — at least the wife could stay outside. They usually would choose to go
to ghetto together —
Q: Yeah.
A: — because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated,
but not that. Later they knew and most likely we know. But for quite a time Jewish
people didn’t know that when there 1s a transport, the transport is to be killed.

1942 and 1943? Did the term Treblinka mean something?

why not I should be? And then in the third one, I’m sure that he knew the names,
because there was a ter — transport from there. I think that Katyn was not only from
his camp, but from the others as well.
Q: Course.

A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish
army under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans
ask, why do you stop here for the night? Why your women are there? Because
Germans knew. And so they went. I think we were rescued about five or six o’clock
in the afternoon, because they did not know that there was camps.

A: And we went there, and it was the last month when somebody could still join the
army. The Anders’ Army was mainly from Siberia, but also quite a lot of people
came who were taken to German army, and they would go through the — to Polish —
Polish people who were under the occupied person, and they were forcibly joined
the German army. So a lot of people came like that, to them. But, since the war was
over, they was not taking any new people. But — and at that time we could not go to
England. My brother was trying and didn’t before he — he died. And so we’re — we
were in Italy. I was in Porto San Giorgio, and that was [indecipherable] Italy.
And there was a school for girls who didn’t finish. So there were some from the
Polish insurrection, some were through ho — went through Siberia. One of my
friend was a tall, well-built woman — girl, at that time. She was in Siberia, she was
working in the forest cutting the trees. So that’s not exactly a woman job.
Q: No.
A: But otherwise we — we didn’t talk a lot. One was — most of them were driving
trucks to supply there. And one of them said that when it was very hot, th-they
would put wet sheets on them to — to cool themselves. But otherwise they didn’t say
how —
Q: What their Siberian experiences were, huh?
A: No, no.

A: And we didn’t talk about our experiences at all. It was the school and what —
how to do it. And under the — under our school, there were food magazines. And so
we had lot of rats. And in Italy you have, in Polish it’s [indecipherable] it’s a sort
of — something like a — a — over your bed when you sleep, so —
Q: A mosquito net.
A: Mo-Mosquito net. And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once. My other
experience from there was I couldn’t sleep, I went there, and down there, there was

about us, and somebody who was passing by, another soldier, came and say, oh
well, you have a good — so many women around you. And he th — the one who was

so. So I heard it. But —
Q: We — were these soldiers?
A: Yes, Polish soldiers.
Q: Both pole — yeah.
A: Polish soldiers.
Q: I-I have a question about — about General Anders’ Army. Why would people be
joining the army, his army, after the war 1s over? What would have been the reason
for that?
A: We didn’t want to go to Soviet Poland. Poland was not free.
Q: So in other words, it would have been now to fight the Soviets?
A: Well, there were some — I think my daughter-in-law father was in Poland still,
after the war, after the insurrection, and he was fighting there. How he got out, I
don’t know, because we didn’t talk about those things. But he was one who was still
fighting Germans and Russians and he — he was a — we did not fight Russians,
because they were allies, so he was still fighting Germans. And there were some
people left and in Poland a lot was arrested and killed and so on.

A: It’s not — not — for us, the war did not stop there, even for somebody — we could
choose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war, or as a civilian. And many people
decided to go as civilian. If they were found later by Russians that they were in the
underground army, they would be arrested, killed.
Q: I see.
A: So-
Q: So even though they were allies, having fought in an underground army, they
were threats.

My oldest one, I told him, if somebody will ask you something, answer in English,
not in Polish, so they will treat you as a foreigner. Because that was at the time
when it — it could be dangerous, I didn’t know. He was 16 at that time. But I never
expected that I will be able to go to Poland. So, we never expected that, and we —
we didn’t expect that at our lifetime, Poland will be free.
Q: Yeah.
A: But right now 1s still after Ukraine, what would be next is Lithuania, and
Poland, they — they were mentioning that at — at first. But both Lithuania and

those exams in English, even though you knew the subject matter. Then, because it
was in English, it was hard for you to do.
A: Well, I had to pass five exams. One was most likely mathematics; physics and
something like that. Lab. And I was passing four, and the fifth was English, which I
could not pass. I think five times I failed.

through the insurrection, through Italy. In Italy he was studying at Turin

to — to go to one place, and to do [indecipherable] engineering, and he finish
master in engineering. And he hated if somebody will call him engineer. He wanted
to study mathematics. And his professor in Polish university told him, you are too
old for that. He finish, he got the doctorate in mathematics. And apparently, it was

enough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to — to work,
they do. I — they don’t really think of coming back. They don’t think really that they
should belong to Poland and not to be outside this. And it seems to me they’re —
they’re a completely different generation. I lived in free Poland, which was under
150 years when we were not free. And right now some people are — in Poland are

mixed up, and they don’t recognize that they were not free under the Soviet
occupation. There is a lot of progress in the country, as I — I think I mentioned to
you that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to — from Bialystok to Warsaw.
And that half of main road was paved and some half wasn’t. Right now, even in the
village where my mother lived there, everything is paved. There is electricity. Right
now there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si — small. So it’s easy to
pick. So you have to —
Q: They’ve been — they’ve been raised that way, yeah.
A: — start — raised like not — not only it’s a different kind of cherries, not the big
one. So that had to be change, you don’t change it from year to year, you have to do
it. And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000
people, and one — one with higher education only. So education was allowed, but
also some people were pushed, and they should not have the — that higher
education. But definitely everybody has the — much more opportunity. So, the
villages went up, and because of that, some people from there don’t feel that we
were not free for so many years. We — us being outside, we knew what was
happening. They accepted what it was, and it wasn’t a free Poland. So —
Q: And so you’d want people to have a — have a greater understanding of what
freedom means.

Canada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries
outside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these
countries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Bialystok, and
the people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you’d like them to be able
to get about that?
A: I don’t think they would learn by themselves if the — if something will happen.
But what I am not — people — other people are always dissatisfied, I don’t like
what’s right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.
Poland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody. And
as I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that. And
they could stay and learn.

Poland. But here, right now, I — I — is my — my own saying, that et — atheists are not
tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.
Maybe they feel guilty that they don’t believe in God, but I don’t see tolerance in
this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is — 1s separate of state and —
and — and I think it’s going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I’m very
dissatisfied with that, so I don’t know whether people can change it again, back to
religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they — they
have the — right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it’s more difficult,
but those people were — Poland was always fighting Turks and — and Tartars, they
were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were — they were always —
they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any
other people. We don’t have problem with — with Muslims right now in Poland.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if — well, with
Muslims it’s difficult because not all of them are — are fighting.
Q: That’s right.
A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base
of the social work.
