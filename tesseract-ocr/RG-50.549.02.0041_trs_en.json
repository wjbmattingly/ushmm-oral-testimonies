The Red Cross wanted to take me to a hospital and I insisted, I said, \u201cNo, I am dying, I want to go home.\u201d So I -- An old taxi cab, converted into somewhat of an ambulance took me home and I told the driver, \u201c\u201cGo and ask for my father. Don\u2019t shock my mother, because I haven\u2019t seen her for some time.\u201d And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked for my father, wasn\u2019t there, then he told my mother that he had something for her, and my mother thought that it was a suitcase that my father had sent from France. And he had finally said, \u201cLook, why don\u2019t you go with me?\u201d So I -- my mother walked down. It was snowing, and she looked into the car and she was a little confused because she didn\u2019t recognize me. And so then I told her, \u201cMother,\u201d and finally, after she looked three times, says, \u201cWalter?\u201d And that is when she called a neighbor to have to carry me in, and I remember the neighbor touched my legs and they were inflamed and extremely painful. So, eventually, they got me in and someone in the train had given me an apple, that caused me to have a little diarrhea, so I asked them to take me to the bathroom. And shortly thereafter, the bell rang, 1t was my father and my mother yelled, \u201cPaul, Walter is here.\u201d So he came and he saw me and then he just couldn\u2019t control himself and cried for a long time.

And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, \u201cNevermind, we\u2019re going to say that -- that he was not here.\u201d So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the basement. Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother\u2019s suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope. So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn\u2019t die. And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the\", my father went to see the commanding officer, told him about me and they came with the military ambulance, and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time."

            "answer": "Oh well, once with Major Hermann. We didn\u2019t -- It didn\u2019t mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi. I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish. After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in France, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you. So I traveled through France as a Frenchman. I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth. So, except -- until when I came to South America, which is about as pro German as you can get, in any part of South America, and quite anti-Semitic. So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other European countries, where I didn\u2019t dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no."

But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a wheelchair and I would do sketches of the GIs. And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents. And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British."

The entire country was destroyed, Dusseldorf 75 percent. There didn\u2019t seem to be a future. Money did not exist, it was bartering. Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering. My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the Alps. My mother continuously cried.

But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to America. And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane. I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in America. And I didn\u2019t know that much about the difference of South America and North America, to me America was America. I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, \u201cWhere do you want to go, eventually?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cAmerica.\u201d \u201cWhat part of America?\u201d And I said North America just to give him an answer. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m very sorry, but my family has an estate 1n -- close to Buenos Aires, in Argentina.\u201d Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave. Said, \u201cYou know that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Well, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try.\u201d And he said that, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there\u2019s no need for me to say anything. All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you\u2019re going to have a very pleasant surprise.\u201d That was his advice. I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large cities, knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas, which happened to be the Russian zone. My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends. And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone several times. And that itself is quite a story."

So I says Slavaninga, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re not French.\u201d And so I told him that actually I was from Alsace-Lorraine and I also spoke German, and he kind of accepted that and he told me what to do and I became a coal trimmer. A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal and shoves it to the firemen, who in turn put the coal into the fire. So I worked together with a -- with a black guy from Curacao, his name was Lovey. And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening. I began to do drawings, copies of photographs and I became rather popular on the ship and the captain called me one day and told me that we were going to first go to Vitoria in Brazil and that he asked me to be quiet, that he would not turn me over to the authorities. I had told him that I had an uncle in Utawai who was waiting for me, and that came because I had met some guys on an Argentine ship. One of them had told me that his family lived in Montevideo, that I was welcome. Then he gave me an address in Montevideo. The other one gave me an address in Buenos Aires where I could stay. So anyway, I told the captain that I had an uncle in -- in Montevideo and he said, \u201cT\u2019Il bri -- take you Montevideo, so just don\u2019t move in Brazil and let the immigration and the police come aboard and I\u2019 ll take care of you.\u201d And so Lovey, my companion, asked me, \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I say, \u201che told me that he wouldn\u2019t turn me over to the authorities.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the captain, there\u2019s no way he will protect you.

And the Germans are very desirable immigrants. They\u2019re not trashy. They become teachers, they become professionals. They integrate, marry natives, contrary to the British. So they\u2019re very much desired and in demand and some of them become outstanding citizens, some of them enter politics, some of them become statesmen. So, as a whole, German immigration, even in Texas here, I mean, people go out of their way to say, \u201cOh, my grand-grandfather was German.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to me, but they show you that -- they will not go out of their way to say that their great-grandfather was Polish, but if he was German, they will let you know. And of course, there\u2019s many, many German towns here, Brownsville, Fredericksburg, Neiderveld, all kinds of German festivities and so on.

And the horse association\u2019s secretary called me and they didn\u2019t quite know how to handle this request from the United States and so I kind of took over and eventually the idea developed to take 12 stallions to the United States. Shortly before that time, I have to explain; Peruvian parents, parents of polio children used to go to Warm Springs, Georgia with their children. But eventually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here? We give him a car and a chauffeur, it\u2019s cheaper and we don\u2019t lose that much time. So, a doctor came from Georgia and I was introduced to him and he was rather complimentary as to the fine work I had done, and I told him that everything I did was based upon common sense, but I had no schooling in water therapy, but I would like very much to pursue some kind of course. And he invited me to come to Warm Springs, Georgia. I thought, I get a diploma that I can hang on the wall and -- and then I know what I\u2019m doing, and take it from there. So, I was asked to establish contact with horse loving people and I made the same mistake that everybody else makes, and that 1s everybody believes that Texas is the horsey-est state in the nation.

Of course, I have no voc -- no - no control over whether she going to -- going to end up at the age of 25 with drugs or something like that. I-I hope not. Other than that, I look left and right and unfortunately, whenever you see something like the Holocaust, you -- you -- you would think that something like that can never happen again and I wish I could believe that, but I can\u2019t. So, atrocities in the world are not a dampener, or not a way to tell people, \u201cLet\u2019s go into mass education and prevent this from happening again.\u201d No, no, there are many, many prisoners or leaders who said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep people as stupid as possible, because it\u2019s so much easier to govern them. Let\u2019s create some sort of sickening nationalism and let\u2019s teach them that the Albanians, or the Jews, they are no good, they are responsible for your bleeding, they are responsible for your bad economy, they are the ones.\u201d I see it again and again and again.

And so I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try it myself, just to see how the Germans handle this.\u201d And I wrote to, and had quite a correspondence with a member of parliament, a member of the bunderstock, who was head of the judiciary, I think. And he made it very clear, \u201cSorry, Walter, you missed the deadline.\u201d So, in Germany, you miss the deadline, in America there are exceptions to the rule, in Germany there are not. So, I forgot all about it and the people -- the people, some of them died, some of them I didn\u2019t want to have any association with whatsoever. And, you know, Germans tried very hard to claim that, \u201cOh no, we were never Nazis, we were always against it,\u201d and so on. But that\u2019s what you have to expect. Nobody\u2019s going to say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m guilty.\u201d People don\u2019t do that. So, you know. Anyway -- So, I have not -- I know people who benefitted greatly during the Hitler regime, and do I want to make a big issue, do I want to? No, I -- You have to know that whatever you do has some kind of positive result. If not, why touch it? It doesn\u2019t do any good."
