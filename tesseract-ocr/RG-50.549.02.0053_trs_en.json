            "answer": "I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little camps out of Stutthof were concentrated. And the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning down the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian\u2019s doctor taking care of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I had the two typhuses. And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. And after three days, or a week, I don\u2019t know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front 1s coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg. Lomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we - they shouldn\u2019t notice that we have typhus. And they said, \u201cNo, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to.\u201d But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little carriage, but they said, \u201cThe first house in Lomborg, you have to get out.\u201d So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we went out, and the first house we walked in. And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don\u2019t know, at that time I didn\u2019t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn\u2019t know it was preserve, or something. There was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, \u201cShall we drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cI am afraid it may be poisoned.\u201d Left poison, there\u2019s that bottle standing there, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s nothing. And then we couldn\u2019t stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they\u2019re grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women. German, Jewish, it didn\u2019t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where they lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it\u2019s typhus, the Russians didn\u2019t care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. They start running. And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn\u2019t that much water, and anything, and I thought I\u2019Il wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.

He said, \u201cI am too, from Odessa, don\u2019t get scared.\u201d So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were. They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d You know, they dragged me back in the other room. And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a wedding band. And I wasn\u2019t even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la - his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought to myself, \u201cLet him talk.\u201d But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said, \u201c\u201cAkeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?\u201d Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma - Marioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. \u201cMy son wrote a letter at home that you are here in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would like to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you.\u201d And I told him, I said, \u201cI cannot do it. | have to go back home first. I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cDo you love my son?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him well enough. I don\u2019t know what love 1s.\u201d Is -- I -- he didn\u2019t know my age, he didn\u2019t know nothing. Nobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, even to that man that was the fa - and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, \u201cTell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your son 1s, and you\u2019re not even Jewish?\u201d Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don\u2019t even remember, and he says, \u201cYou see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn\u2019t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.\u201d So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn\u2019t the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind. And we felt better, and we didn\u2019t know there was [indecipherable] existed. We didn\u2019t know about people not going back home or nothing.

All taken to Theresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to Auschwitz. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me 1s that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my father was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and - and this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno ghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the thing is 1s, 1s -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes, they\u2019 ll s -- they\u2019Il s -- put us on trains, and they\u2019Il send us home. So they put us on big trucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English, a ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They didn\u2019t give us enough food, the Russians. They didn\u2019t kill us, they didn\u2019t beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren\u2019t beaten up, we weren\u2019t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe Jewish girls. And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese factory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they\u2019re healthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came back. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my family. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, \u201cI am going to Rigenwald.\u201d We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, 1t must have been from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what\u2019s so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to protect when a cow 1s slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs. We learned how to take analysis from a horse\u2019s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It\u2019s a certain chemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness shouldn\u2019t spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife, with the main man\u2019s wife. I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. I -- I told her that\u2019s not proper. I told her your hair doesn\u2019t look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked. We worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from Rigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench. There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he said, \u201cAkdere Marouska?\u201d Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, \u201cIn her room with the other Jewish girl.\u201d He says, \u201cIn her room? You mean to tell me she doesn\u2019t have an apartment of her own?\u201d And his wife got very mad. He said, \u201cI want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.\u201d Because there was dinner in the captain\u2019s house. It\u2019s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So when he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have to be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don\u2019t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel. And what happened is 1s before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls. So what happened 1s is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia. And what happened 1s 1s that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring liquor and so on. But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the woman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That\u2019s the first time I ate watfles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around. She was from Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and nobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldn\u2019t do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the fields and so on."

And he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there\u2019s a order that the -- the Russians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows, no horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called. I was never a veterinarian, so I forgot it.

We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers. We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went out, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped them on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the village that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain. He was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the higher ups, and everything. So everything I wanted, I got. So when the soldiers from each camp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If they wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and he was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I\u2019Il never forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, \u201cAre y -- do you know anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?\u201d And I said to him like that. I put my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, \u201cOh please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d And the Russian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, \u201cMarouska, don\u2019t worry. Anything you want I\u2019ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some medicine when I was sick. You brought food for me. I will help you with anything I can.\u201d A very, very lo -- I couldn\u2019t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with intelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn\u2019t understand why he does it. And he said, you know what?

When we came into the villages, the houses were empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything was in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn\u2019t even have a sweater on. I'll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn\u2019t remember before, riding boots, and -- and they\u2019re real good boots, because one of the officer, police officer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That\u2019s all I had with me, because I was going with him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I said, \u201cOkay. You are taking me to the train, but I\u2019m going to give you a letter. And when the captain does something to you, you tell him, \u2018I have a letter from Maroushka about the seven horses.\u2019 \u201d I said, \u201cAt least I can do for you that you don\u2019t get punished, or put in jail, or anything like that.\u201d So what I did 1s I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat down, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to me, \u201cNow remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I want you to be like you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t know how to speak, you don\u2019t know how to - you\u2019re -- you\u2019re dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.\u201d Because at that time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially on trains, and so on.

And the Akar was shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed down, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn\u2019t take long we arrived in Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him, and everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so happened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, \u201cWho would like to stay in Austria?\u201d And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and like I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved sports.

The teacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in, my book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, \u201cI am leaving.\u201d And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, I\u2019m not going to get into it. I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money. He would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn\u2019t take me in, so I went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school. So I\u2019m telling you, I was a daredevil from the beginning. So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said, \u201cPapa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead. I\u2019m staying 1n this country in. Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and from there we\u2019ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on."

And I don\u2019t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like cattle.

But I have to, and as long as I can drive, and as long as I can work, I will do it. Cornelius is still working again, too. But Pll tell you something, maybe it makes us happier this way. Sometimes I\u2019m very tired, I could hardly get done. Because a lot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are very misunderstanding, and don\u2019t understand the feeling. And I\u2019ve talked to somebody at the federation the other week, and he says to me, \u201cWe have a big problem here, Marsha.\u201d And he\u2019s right, psychologically, he said, \u201cYou are one of the high lite -- lay person, and now you\u2019re staff, and that is a big problem.\u201d And he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t stand anything that is wrong.\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t, because you know, when I go out, and I raise in two days, four and a half thousand dollars to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners are alright or not, because three of them were made, and it was selected the worst of them.\u201d I said -- and that 1s what hurts me. That person that runs that museum, I cannot mention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do with museum, everybody knows me, the whole community. Starting from the federation, to the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else. Everybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem. But I have to work, and I -- this is the only job I know. And I\u2019ve learned, believe it or not, at my age, the last three years I been working on the computer, and I\u2019m pretty good at it."

I was 10 days, I'll show you, from the president of the University of Utah, southern Utah. I was supposed to be 48 hours, I stayed for 10 days. I set up a Holocaust museum in the library, and the kids were coming down from the mountains, the Indian kids, and all kind of kids. And it was called Jewish week.

            "answer": "The something that bothers me 1s that a lot of them are adding certain things that other people went through, that they discussed with. And that what bothers me when I was interviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and Auschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everything else. I worked with, \u201cThe Triumphant Spirit,\u201d with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the Hungarians, from Budapest I\u2019m talking about. They didn\u2019t -- they -- they only start suffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don\u2019t think they went through the things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I couldn\u2019t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- \u201939, or the German Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived pretty good. You understand what I mean? And like again with the Anne Frank\u2019s diary. You take the Anne Frank\u2019s diary, there\u2019s hundreds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne Frank\u2019s diary was found first. And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank\u2019s diary.

I never had a lot to do with her, because her mother was Jewish, and she didn\u2019t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to do with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza, somewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don\u2019t know what it -- what it is. I never went, because I didn\u2019t like it the way she treat her mother. It was her mother 80\" birthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother\u2019s aunt. And I went there - Aunt Molly, and her biggest pleasure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and things like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when she send me tickets when Anne Frank\u2019s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I didn\u2019t go. And I don\u2019t really believe in Anne Frank\u2019s diary. I believe that it happened, of course, it did happen. But there is so many diaries been written, there\u2019s so many children been hidden, there\u2019s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three years old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn\u2019t even know what it means that little piece of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or anything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more head, or something. Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was hidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my mother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34 years old, in Stutthof. I don\u2019t know, like I told you, where she was killed. Now that I read This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving. So now I said forget it. If I want to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that\u2019s all -- they\u2019re here in Los Angeles. I don\u2019t have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there\u2019s so many thousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they\u2019re building millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas. Not that we don\u2019t need it, we need that too, but there 1s a limit to everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There were standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan\u2019s. So I sent Cornelius in to get canned food for them. And I tried to give as much as I can. When I had the money, everybody got. But now I try to give as much as I can. In fact, somebody told me I\u2019m too generous. Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels, and I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels and cream cheese in the morning, for the department. So if -- if I can -- now we are separated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is redone. So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it over. And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it comes to me very hard. But this is my pleasure. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

And after reading a Holocaust book, or something else, I buy myself a little romance book, to relax me. So I lay down in bed, and Cornelius watches television downstairs, and I read that -- and I go from the first page, to the middle, to the last page, to know what the ending is. And that relaxes me, and I fall asleep with it."

I also learned that when I go to a party, they dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old women. They want to stay forever young, because they never had a childhood. And they never had, really, a young life, because they had to work, and bring up a family, and everything else. To me, being a designer, it hurts my eyes. But I know what they feel, psychologically. The third thing is what bothers me tremendously is that the survivor money is handled by Americans. And that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Or when a survivor goes into a state home, and there is millions of dollars in -- in New York. A survivor should never, after what they went through, stay in a state home, should be treated completely different. Not because he\u2019s a survivor, and he\u2019s something special.
