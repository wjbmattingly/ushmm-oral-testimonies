a country in Europe did not exist. It was not on the map of Europe. It was divided

countries tr — took advantage of Poland’s production, they — they milked Poland to
death, taking advantage of everything. So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn’t even 20
years that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own. So we didn’t — we

didn’t know at that time that they — what they had the agreement with Germany,
that as soon as Germany attacks Poland from the west, Russians will attack
Poland from the east. Our forces were fighting as hard as they could to keep ra —
Germans from marching far into Poland, but eventually they did get all the way to
Warsaw, to capital. But in the meantime, Russians took over the whole eastern part
of Poland.
Q: So, if they attacked, or marched in on September 17", they must have reached
Nowogrodek within an hour.
A: They were second day. They were second day they were 1n pol — in
Nowogrodek. We couldn’t — we couldn’t understand some Belarussians and Jews
were greeting them. They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into
Nowogrodek, and they were — the orang — Russian army was pitiful.
Q: What do you mean — what do — why do you say that?

them were like skeletons. People were dirty in the — I could — it’s hard to explain.
We had to c-compare what we were comparing to our soldiers that were really, you
know, sharp looking. This was misery. But they were in power, so what can we do?
And within a — one day of getting into Nowogrodek, the terror s-started. Russians,
with the help of the local communists were arresting policemen, government
people, any military, teachers, priests, they were arresting. Pretty soon the local jail
was full of our local best — our local people. Of course —

afternoon he came home. They — they questioned him and released him, and I
remember hearing my parents whispering, talking. My mother insisted that he
leaves Nowogroédek and goes over to the German side, to the town where he is
from, where his family was, and my father didn’t want to go because he wa — didn’t

Jew, with a red band just [indecipherable] that he was a — one of the commissars
that became communist commissar, led three or four, I don’t remember now,
Russian soldiers with the rifles with bayonets. They took my father, they put the br
— put him [indecipherable] and marched him, and that was the last time we seen
him.
Q: Really?
A: We haven’t seen him since. For — for quite a while, it got to be known that if the
jail would allow us to be — to give some food parcel or clothes parcel to the people
in jail, that meant that the person was still in jail. After about two or three weeks,
they stopped taking parcels. That was indication that my father was not in local jail
any more. Where, or how, we don’t know. We could never, during the war, after the
war, we could never find out what happened to him.
Q: Did you know —
A: And du — du — his main sin was that he was active in a community life, that he
fought at least Russians in 1920. Russians and Germans practiced the same thing. If
you eliminate leaders of the community, it’s going to be that much easier to run the
community. Well, that was my father’s problem. He was active of the — in his
community life, so they had to get rid of him.

Q: Okay. What a terror for your family.
A: Oh God, it was terrible. On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my
father, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town — and like I said, we
had a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted
to — for Russian people to take to live in there. My mother insisted that we will
move if they give us a house to move in. And that’s why we did — we were not very
surprised when on the 10" of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a — some
soldiers, at night — they always done all those arresting and deporting at night. They
— it was the middle of the winter, cold, about a foot or so of snow. They marched to
our house and told us to get ready, pick — get ready, pick up whatever you can carry,
because you’re getting deported.
Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved?
A: No, it’s the same house. But we were — we were thought that we were being
deported from our house to the other house. We were — we went — we didn’t know
we were being deported to Russia, to Siberia. So 1t was quite a shock.
Q: Oh my. Let’s talk a little bit about the months in between. Did you ever go to the
prison where your father was, to bring food?

friend, my gir — her girlfriend, when she wasn’t a — she wasn’t deported, so she was
there, and she, after the war, she told us that she saw my father about a month —
month or so after we were deported, he was being led to the railroad by — with a

already deported to Russia. And that’s what happened. After the war she told us.
That’s when she told us.
Q: Let’s — let’s talk about this a little bit more. You say you never found out what
happened to your father. That is, in — where — what his destiny was, where he was
taken, or anything. Is that — that so?
A: That’s correct, yes. We tried, through Red Cross, we — all kinds of institutions
that had lists of — of our people that were murdered, in Katyn forest, in other areas.
We — n-none of those lists have my father’s name.
Q: So this —
A: But then, of course, they were — lot of our people, lot of men and women were
murdered in the small towns and buried right there, close to it. And some cemeteries
were never found out, never opened, never found out where, who was.

ja—as you Said, the jails filled up so quickly after the Soviets marched in, and what
happened to most of the people there.
A: Well, si— you see, the Russians, probably some of the lists of people that they
were arrested, and some of the people that they murdered, it j — it just happens that
Belarussians do also have lists of people that they arrested. They were arrested in
that territory.
Q: Right.
A: And th-they were — for some stupid reason, they will not release that list. So

the business, and my mother worked for them. She had to work for them, and so it
wasn’t our business any more. As far as the life, right away there were shortages of
just about everything. Even the — such a thing as salt, y-you had to queue — line up

for hours sometime to get some salt. Sugar was hardly ever in the stores. Meat. The
only thing that we could get pretty easy was bread, but otherwise, there were
shortages of everything.
Q: How do you explain that?
A: Well, Russians were exporting — taking everything into Russia. There were
trains being loaded and taken into the deep Russia.
Q: And of course, supply lines were — were cut.
A: Acor — of course. So — and of course the — the life was miserable. Everybody —
the fear — this 1s the way they run the country, fear. One person against the other.
And they, right away that — did that fear took over the whole town. People were
afraid, they were li — would — before they would say anything, they would look
around if there was anybody listening. Because all you had to do was say something
about that you were not pleased what was happening, you can wind up in jail right
away.
Q: Did this extend to school, as well?
A: Well, of course, the teachers were our old teachers, but at least once a week we
would have to have special classes, where they would try to convince us of what a
wonderful country, what a free country Russia is, how — how advanced, how — of
course, we knew better, even though we were children.

degrees below zero, but at least a foot of snow on the ground. And middle of the

and we were taken to the government building, not far from railroad station, and the

cars that were prepared for transporting mass people. The way it was built, on each
end of the — the freight car, there were shelves, two shelves on each end, where they

Most of them were older men.

Q: And how could you tell?

changed the direction. And of course the — the — the countryside that we would see
through those windows was changing gradually too. There were more snow, more —
it was getting colder, and there were more and more forests. And we traveled

out of the train, and they put us on a slow horse-drawn sleds. And again, the grown-
ups and older children had to walk. Only the smaller and old were riding 1-1n the
sled. And for three days we traveled to our final destination, staying at night,

divide pieces of bread into few pieces so every few hours we would have a few
bites of bread. She was unbelievably strong.

middle of virgin forests.

A: It — 1t wasn — part of it was beautiful, not just pretty, 1t was beautiful. The nature

of bread. Everybody, every person, child and old people were assigned 200 grams
of bread, black bread, which amounted sometime to a couple of slices. We were
assigned that much a day, and we could buy it. That — no more, no less, but that was
what we could buy.
Q: So, in other words, you weren’t given food.
A: No, we had to buy it.
Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money’?
A: Well, we had some money with us.
Q: I see.

currency already was Russian dru — ruble.

among other things we had a beautiful horse. And the young man that worked for
us, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard,
among men, that they were goin — the Russians were going to take our horse away.
But he suggested that he — he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse,
somebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse. And my mother
sold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.
Q: And she took that one you left.

you.

that was farther on, not wer — next to our camp, there was a area about a couple
kilometers from there, where there was a spring. And she would bring clear water.
Sh — what she would have to do 1s fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood
— on this horse-drawn sled. She would have to go to the — chop the ice, fill ti — with
the bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the
water there. Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside
the bakery. She would do that all day long. It wou — believe me, I helped her
sometime, it was a back blake — breaking job. And especially, she used to wear a
sack in front of her as a apron. From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like
she was a— she was armor, th-the — the ice so —

A: When my sister turned 16, I believe — anybody over the age of 16 had to work.
And lucky for — for her, she got a job in the local nursery, so she took care of little
children. At least she didn’t have to work in — because the — all the other — and the
other industry was logging.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And eventually my mother worked there too. What the de — women would do,
when the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the
snow so the — the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and
then big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw — would draw those logs
to the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate —
whatever it was.
Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it’s about the food. That
is, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much
as you wanted to.
A: Only one bre — specially the bread, that was assigned to you.
Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn’t handed out.

Poland. And sometime — my grandmother, sometime some friends — as a matter of
fact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogrodek that owed
my father some money. And he — he looked into it and found our address where we
were at, and send us lifesaving food that we’re — I’m still grateful for it. So, like I

was that was in that package?
A: I think it — most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was — God, 1t was —
Q: There’s a lot you can do with pork belly.
A: Exactly. Especially when you’re starving, a little bit of fat —
Q: That’s right.
A: — 1s — it’s a treasure.
Q: Yeah. So, did anyone get sick here?
A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started
losing some infants, some babies. There was no — women didn’t have enough milk
to feed the babies, there was no milk to be had. The babies were starving, they were
dying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear
wood crosses. And after children, little children, the older people started dying.
Within a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people. Our camp
consisted of people from two different parts of Poland. Half of us were from
Nowogrodek, and half were from the southern part of where — what was — what is
now Ukraine, close to the Lwow. So there were people from two — two different
parts of Poland.

he was typical communist. To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his
nation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in
Russia. Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher,
Russian, of course. And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to
school. And of course, we didn’t mind subjects like math and arc — physics,
chemistry, or whatever. But of course they also tried to convince us again of the
advantages of communist system, which didn’t work with us at all.

breathe in the cold air, because 1t was — when you — if you didn’t have anything in
front of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So
you always had to have something in you — in front of your face.

water in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there’s all this snow
outside.

could. Sometime it was like a tunnel between the — on the each side there be about
five feet of snow, and you just go. And the roads, with the passing of the sleds,

away would start.
Q: Would it be hot in summer?
A: Well, I wouldn’t say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it’s — the beauty of
nature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never
seen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it
wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm,
some — a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children —
and I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking
mushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry — wild
raspberries. And like I said before, if 1t wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would
have survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so
we had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of
mushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking
mushrooms, picking berries.

government’s center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for —

Russians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of

we brought with us from Poland for some food.

it’s a Steam room, and next to it is the place where they put all their clothes that they
take off, and it’s so pr — it’s so hot up there, that it’s supposed to kill all the lice —
Q: Did it?
A: — because, let’s face it, in the conditions that we were in, no soap, no soap, you
just wash with water. The pi — oh — only laundry you could do was in the water
without any soap, and lack of clothes breeds all kinds of filth, lice among them. So
my mother had a routine. Every couple days we had to strip, and we would look
through our clothes, killing all whatever was moving.
Q: Oh my. Oh my.
A: It’s terri — yo-you don’t — people that didn’t go through it, don’t realize what a
hell it is.

none. There were totally none. The — the smallest — the animals that I seen were
weasels. And of course, you couldn’t even come close to, they were so fast. The

nobody drew a lot which was right in front of our barrack. So my mother went to

It just again happened that my mother was sick. She lifted something heavy while
she was working in the woods, and hurt her back, she couldn’t get up. She was in
bed. And th — we were really starving. We had a family get together, and decided
that we have t — my brother, who was that time just eight years old — no, I’m sorry,
he was practically nine already. No, he was eight years old. And I was practically

13 — no, I was 13 years old. So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter,
we have to go and get those potatoes. Twenty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30
below zero.

Q: Oh my gosh.

A: I, previous summer, I work — I made a sled, I built a s — myself a sled. We were
gonna use that sled to bring those potatoes. So, my mother gave me and my brother
slice of bread. That had to last us two days. And early in the morning we marched
with dragging that sled. We went to, a 13 and a eight, practically nine year old boys,
28 kilometers to bring the 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.

Q: Potatoes. And you did?

A: We walked all day. When I close my eyes now, I still see when we got out of the
woods, there was a small hill, and on top of the hill there were some hats — hats,
with the chimneys, and the smoke coming from the chi — it looked like picture from
heaven, after walking all day. I found the hats, with my — where the potatoes were.

bodies, and the cigars, or smo — I mean, s — pipes and smoking. We slept all on the

morning. I went outside. Turned out during the night, about 12 inches of snow fell.

you.
A: But this was — going through the virgin forest was just a, you know, path cut out

asking if they will allow us to tie our sled to their horse — horse drawn sled, you

for the horses that would be fed on the — 1n our camp. And the two women climbed
on the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it. We were about the last ones of the
whole caravan of those sleds. E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the
middle of the distance to our camp. There was a steep hill, downwards went the
road, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now.
And there the pass — the road turned left. Well, we were coming down th-the sleds
that went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was
pretty slick going. I kept holding the horse as much as I could, but the — gradually
horse start to galloping, faster and faster. Finally I couldn’t keep up with him, so I
let go. The sled with the — went all the way down to the hill, and made the turn. As
it made the turn to the left, it slid sideways, hit the embankment of snow, and the
two women were catapult out of the top of the sled, into the big pile of snow. All I
could see is two pair of legs sticking out. Of course, my brother turn over too.
Q: What happened to the potatoes?
A: Well, they were — they were turned over too, into the snow. It took us about half
an hour to straighten out the sled, and put back the potatoes on — on the sled

were at our camp.

way it worked, Russians at that time, when Germany attacked Russia, were in such
a bad shape, within a few months, Germany was right into the Russian territory.
They went through the eastern Poland, into German authority. Russians were
looking for help, for allies. At that time, Russia held about a quarter of a million
Polish soldiers in it — prison of war camps. Russians wanted to use those men to
defend Russia. They tr — to — got in touch with Polish government in exile in ri — in
London, to form Polish army in Russia. They agreed — Polish government agreed
on one condition. That they will release rest of the people, too. That included us. So
