They always had boarding schools. And they got the money from my grandfather to do it. My mother was one of the very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst. She studied with Dr. Freud, and he became friends of the family. I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a psychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was aclose friend of my mother -- of my mother's.

They believed in what was then a very novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding school.

And he was transferred, and at one point in order to be near her joined what was called the Camel Corps, and I guess it was what is today Palestine. | Ofcourse, one of the problems that comes with being in a boarding school is that you share your parents with alot of people. Of course, we didn't know any other -- any -- anything else. We had a Bavarian -- I guess she wasn't a nurse - caretaker, who took care of us while they were busy.
