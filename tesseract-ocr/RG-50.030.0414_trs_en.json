            "answer": "All right, I will tell you about my family first, but before I start, I wanted to say something why I am here and why I was hesitating for a long time to tell my story. The reason was because it\u2019s not the typical story of the Holocaust. I was not in a concentration camp. It is my life during the Nazis outside. It is actually a story of faith, all about faith, hope, courage, think about all miracles. I want to bring it out 1n this story, that if you believe in it or not, miracles still exist. Now, you want to hear about my family, correct? I, we have been six. Originally, we had a brother died before I was born, and other sister. I am the youngest in my family. I have a sister Berthe. She\u2019s the oldest. Then I have sister Fanny (ph) she is \u2014 she comes after. I adored Fanny. She was \u2014 had charisma. She was outgoing. She was beautiful. Sometimes I wonder how I admired her so that I didn\u2019t resent it in that I wasn\u2019t jealous. For instance, coming back, all my family was very good in mathematics. My father was almost a genius in that field. She was excellent, but I wasn\u2019t very good mathematics. I was the best in physics. But I never reached Fanny, you understand, and the teacher would always say when I was a little kid, \u201cYou are good, but not like your sister Fanny.\u201d I didn\u2019t resent her. I loved her, and it is actually strange. Then, I had brother. He was known \u2014 he was an excellent chess player, and what he did \u2014 Fanny had a doctorate in chemistry, the other sister just told you \u2014 he was in business with stamps. He was a stamp collector, but it was really, it was his business, and then he was excellent chess player, they called him from all Europe (ph). And then there were myself. That it 1s about the story. We grew up in Vienna. Vienna is one of the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I love Vienna. I\u2019d go back to Vienna, and people sometimes resent it, coming from the Nazis. Vienna was occupied \u2014 why do you go back? I did not know at first. I was thinking, \u201cWhy do I go back?\u201d I found out I go \u2014 if I would not go back, if I would be afraid, it would be a victory of Hitler. This city didn\u2019t belong to him. It was part of me. I grew up there with my father and my mother my sisters. I went to school. I was so happy there and I want to keep it. So, I go back whenever I have some money left. I go back, enjoy the street, enjoy the schools. That 1s about. Do you want me to talk about other things like schools?"

            "answer": "What is my earliest memory as a child? You will laugh, but I sort of remember when we celebrated a Jewish holiday. I must have been very little, and my father was sitting was sitting there and this was a Seder, and that he had a pillow sitting it. I had a feeling he 1s not really there, he was so involved, but not my mother. He was so involved and at times, I asked my mother, \u201cIs father God himself?\u201d I was so little, maybe three or four years old, but it made that kind of impression. My life was very lively. We were four children. As you can imagine, I was the youngest, really the youngest. My oldest sister Berthe was like a mother to me, and I always thought, well, she tried to boss me around, but it was not easy, and I thought very often, \u201cOne day I will be older than all of you, and then I will be the boss!\u201d And they adored me, but suddenly, nobody expected that there was a little girl here. And I was actually spoiled, but not spoiled, because if you hear my story and what developed and how I developed, you have to tell yourself, maybe it doesn\u2019t hurt if you spoil somebody.

Vienna was a city everybody would like to go. There was art. They describe it in the books; later it came out. There is no other city in Europe that you have at the same time, the most famous writer, the most famous artists, the most famous composers. There was like music in the air. Now, when I go back, I hear it. I walk on the Chancellor Strasse \u2014 people are playing the violin, people are singing. It\u2019s a different world. When people sometimes visit Vienna now, and they come back and they say something like, \u201cI was a little bit disappointed, the way you describe it.\u201d I cannot understand it. They did not feel what I feel. They do not see the city like I see it."

He says he can take very interest because he can do \u2014 they can take everything away from you, but your learning, it will always stay with you. And I remember when I studied, all the schools, they were very strict, especially when I had the medical exams. I took the street car. He would be \u2014 he did not know when I would be coming home. He would wait hours to find out, \u201cDid you pass it? Did you pass it?\u201d Yes, I was close, but it was everything was learning. To a certain extent, I was closer to my mother even. She was more practical. She wanted me to have nice clothes to have \u2014 to have \u2014 father just wanted to have it all, too, but all in that picture of learning.

That was the \u2014 my father was always \u2014 here about to stress it (ph) \u2014 he was unusual. He was unusual, then I would say he was almost like a genius when it came to mathematics. He didn\u2019t have a formal training, and he could serve, he could help us with any kind, the hardest problems there was. He would know how to solve it. He, himself sometimes, he couldn\u2019t explain it to me how he did it. He hadn\u2019t learned it, but he came to it. Fanny, that sister, was to a certain extent like that. Then, I do not know. I had a brother, Benjamin \u2014 he died when he was 10. I was not born yet. And, they would tell stories \u2014 none of us children were like him. They would tell stories about him, how brilliant like as an infant he was. He would read something. He read the Torah. He knew the whole thing by heart. How kind and good, gentle people would talk to him. Years after he passed by, there was still, I was told, on his grave from some gentle people a note \u201cHere lies Benjamin\u201d and a few words that would describe it."

You grow older, you lose sometimes somebody, but I would still say Mahkta (ph), she was my best friend. Funny, I would not say my sister, she was my best friend. I had friends.

When we were little girls, you looked at him, and you said, \u2018This is the boy I\u2019m going to marry. This is a boy I want to marry.\u2019\u201d And, so, I married him, but it wasn\u2019t hard.

I don\u2019t think they would accept anything from me anymore, but if I can help you anyway, tell me.\u201d Here, again, I had no idea that she was one of the richest people in the country, and I think for a moment and I said, \u201cYou know, Muriel, maybe you can help me.\u201d She said, \u201cWhat is it Leney?\u201d I said, \u201cI wrote a letter to my cousin, Sam Menczel, in German. My English is no good. Could you translate it?\u201d \u201cOh, sure. Come up to my apartment.\u201d Next day I come up to Muriel. I realize suddenly that she must be very wealthy \u2014 not that arrogant or anything, just the neighborhood, where it was. Went up to her apartment, and met here that little girl, that Connie, and she sits down and took the long \u2014 it was a very long letter writing to Sam Menczel. She was \u2014 after she was done, she leads to her door and she looks at me. She had tears in her eyes, and she says \u2014 mind you, she practically did not know me only from that lecture to that time \u2014 tears in her eyes, and she says, \u201cLeney, if there\u2019s anything I can help you, please get \u2014 I\u2019m leaving for a few days. I give you my address. It\u2019s American Express in Paris. Wherever I go, they will send the mail to me.\u201d And, she \u2014 I remember that. \u201cAnd I will travel back again. I can\u2019t send affidavit, nothing.\u201d I sent the letter on \u2014 her letter that she translated on to my cousin in New York. Weeks passed, I didn\u2019t hear. Suddenly, I got a letter. I have that letter after so many years. I get a letter from him. \u201cDear Leney\u2019\u2019,, he said, \u201cI read your story. I was so touched, what you made from your life. \u2019'm going to \u2014 I want to help you. I\u2019m going to send you an affidavit, and I will \u2014 I will be good to you. My wife, Rosie, and the children will love you, and forget your boyfriend or fiance. I cannot. I\u2019m not rich enough.

I carry that letter wherever I go, but one thing was clear to me. I will not leave without him, without Eddie. I\u2019d rather die. I don\u2019t care at all. So, I got this letter and a few weeks again pass, trying to make some connection for him. Impossible, I didn\u2019t find anybody. Suddenly, I get a call, who was it? Muriel. Who was it? Muriel. And again, I knew really nothing except for that one lecture that I saved her a seat. Muriel, she said to me, \u201cLeney, did you hear from your cousin?\u201d \u201cYes. But he\u2019s not going to send anything to Eddie, and I\u2019m not leaving without him.\u201d She thinks a minute, and she says, \u201cLeney, don\u2019t despair.\u201d I was a stranger to her. \u201cDon\u2019t despair Even if I sent so many affidavits \u2014 wait, wait, help will come.\u201d A few days passed, Muriel called again. \u201cLeney, Eddie has affidavit. I didn\u2019t have to send anything. I called up. I talked with the ambassador, and an affidavit is there.\u201d So, you can imagine. The world was ours. The world was ours. I mean, was it really true that just a few weeks there was nothing? And I now had to wait for a certain number. Even with the affidavit, you cannot go to the United States. Your number has to come up. It was a quota. There was a quote \u2014 from the number way back. They were not ready for us yet. We had to wait."

I find the telephone number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard time to get in. He didn\u2019t want to talk to me. How I did it, I do not know. I reached him. I talked to him.

He said, \u201cLeney, I received my \u2014 I have my visa. I have the number.\u201d I told you that before. \u201cI have everything. What will you do now? Your number is up. If you don\u2019t come to Vienna in two, three days, your number will be given to somebody else.\u201d So, you realize the tremendous problem, not going back to Vienna meant I would never be with Eddie again, because he\u2019s going to the United States and I wouldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have it. Going to Vienna was a tremendous danger, almost 100 percent. They would send me right off into concentration camp. \u201cYou have signed it. You have signed it.\u201d I talk my friends, she wouldn\u2019t want to hide me in order to force me not to go back. I said, \u201cI have nothing to lose. I will try to go back.\u201d And here comes the story about going back. As far as I knew, I will not be able to make it because the Germans will send me right off into the concentration camp. Now, I needed in order to go back, I needed a visa, a German visa, to enter Vienna from Switzerland. Well, I think, \u201cLet me try.\u201d I get my stuff together, go to Zurich, and I go to the consulate \u2014 a tremendous, big building, a lot of people are waiting there in front to get in, maybe a hundred or more, but this \u2014 none of them were Jewish.

To go out, not \u2018til you hear from me at a later date, I do not know when. The people all went home. Within seconds that tremendous place was empty. The only person who was standing there was myself, and two of the Nazis, the higher officials, Gestapos. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You get like so rigid. You do not know what to do, what is happening. You act, or you don\u2019t act. So, what should I do? No gentile, no Christian, nobody can get in. I\u2019m frightened to death, but I had only one desire. I want to be with Eddie. If I can\u2019t be with Eddie, I might as well die. And I thought and I thought. I had to get in.

I assume right off this is the consul. Next to him, Gestapo, and guns, and you name it. And he looked at me, didn\u2019t address me, either. Who was I? You needed permission. You need an invitation.

I had on me my passport, but I didn\u2019t open it, nobody said \u2014 but you can imagine for hours, I was scared silly, but they were nice to me. They did not know who I was.

I had to undress. It was a woman. And I had \u2014 I still have it, I have to show you. When you got married you had nothing yet. My husband gave me a little golden chain with a little heart.

My husband said it would bring me luck.\u201d And she looked at it, and she started discussing it with two or three other men, and then I was already dressed. A man comes to me and says, \u201cLook, you will hope be able to take the little heart and neck- (ph) out when you come here.

I arrived in Vienna in the evening. Eddie picks me up. We were not allowed to take a taxi or anything, and he said to me your number might have been gone by now. It took me just two days, three days. They might have given me to somebody else. And, did I talk too fast? No. And, he said \u2014 the next day we rushed to the American Consulate. Yes, my number was still there.
