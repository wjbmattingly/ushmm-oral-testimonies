When I was a teenager I spoke to him once and he didn\u2019t answer me, didn\u2019t answer me.

But he accomplished miracles as you will later find out. And I\u2019m sure it had something to do with his relationship he had with the higher being."

I just learned some of the symbols and how to pronounce them and how to read them. But you know that time period could not have lasted very long because I didn\u2019t do that very long. And it was must be shortly thereafter that we left. That means in other words, that I didn\u2019t leave the German public school. Well I left Germany in 39. Probably 38."

And playing in the sand and a little girl came over and she said may I play with you. And I was just about to say yes when she added but not if you\u2019re Jewish. My mommy doesn\u2019t let me play with Jewish children. So I said well I am, or you can\u2019t or something. And that was the end of that. But I remember it to this day. And I\u2019m now 67.

There was a current joke that went around in Berlin that it ended with the Jews and the bicyclists. And the question would be why the bicyclists. And then the answer would be why the Jews. And that time it was one of the current jokes. It sounds better in German. And let me see what else. It was just a general feeling of, I don\u2019t know, something dark surrounding us.

And she lent him some money and he, I think he took a train to um, somehow he found -- there was two places he went to. He was in Amsterdam and he was in London, trying to find a stepping stone. I\u2019m a little confused where he went first. And then eventually he ended up briefly in New York to gain a foothold. But in order to enter legally into the United States, he needed a quota number, visa. And so in those days, people in that position would either go to Canada. Some ended up in China. In Shanghai. And he opted or maybe it was the only choice he Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 18 had to go to Havana Cuba, to wait for this and so that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime, we had a year without him. And I must tell you he was a marvelous cook. He was a great cook and he had made a bouillabaisse his last day and I remember after he had left, he had left in the evening. And I don\u2019t quite know what mode of transportation. He must have taken the train to Hamburg, to take the boat over to England, something like that. There we were with his soup that he had left. And I remember my mother and I eating that soup and the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. And for many, many, many years, I couldn\u2019t stand bouillabaisse. I just couldn\u2019t stand. Then much later on I developed a real liking for it because we were together again. That was something. It was a terrible shock to have him gone all of a sudden. But he saved himself and he saved us.

            "answer": "OH a great deal of it. In fact fear was our constant companion. Because then we had Kristallnacht. November ninth wasn\u2019t it? 1938. I believe. And my mother was a real Berliner. There\u2019s an expression in Berlin. If somebody comes at you all excited, we say Nabublensten (German) which means oh so where\u2019s the fire? You know. So at 4:00 in the morning or at 4:30 or 5 there\u2019s a pounding at the door. And my mother gets up out of her sleep. This is some time after my father left. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how long. And all grumpy and she goes to the door and opens it and she said so where\u2019s the fire? And the person knocking on the door said the temple across the street 1s on fire. The Jewish temple. This Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 19 was Fazanemistrasse. The corner had hotel Kampinski at it. That was the last address we had in Berlin. And kitty corner from us across the street was the, a Jewish synagogue, which is now by the way the Jewish Community Center. I saw it in 1978. They did something very smart. They saved the front of this temple. It had been a beautiful building. They saved the doorway and made a modern building for the Jewish Community Center, and put the doorway there. It was a striking and very beautiful thing. And the strange feelings come back after so many years and see that. But anyway to get back to that horrible night or morning. My mother must have gone out the door to take a peek at it. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. She left me upstairs in bed or maybe I slept through all of this. I don\u2019t know. And I remember. She stayed home that day. And I remember saying oh how nice. You don\u2019t have to go to work. You\u2019re staying with me. And I remember her sad smile and she said but what a reason. I was too young to understand the horrible things that were going on around me. And another really nightmare moment was we at this time lived in a furnished room. And I in fact slept on a cot in the kitchen. It was a nice big old Berlin apartment and the lady who lived there was a wonderful old lady. Her name was Mrs. Moses. I think her first name was Martha. I\u2019m not sure. She had a retarded daughter, a little shriveled lady, must have been in her 40s or 50s, scared me terribly because I didn\u2019t know about retardation. But she was kindness itself, very old and tired looking. And she was very good to my mother and myself. She had some other tenants there too. She had her son living in the apartment above her. And_ I think it was the day after the fire or very shortly thereabouts that there was talk of Jewish men being searched for by hordes of SA men. You know those were the Brown Shirts. And there Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 20 was a brass door sign next to the apartment door. Outside the front door and it said Moses on it. That was her name. And some very smart person across the way said, you know if I were you, I would unscrew those screws and take that sign off. It\u2019s a very Jewish name. They\u2019re bound to come to you. And my mother was real feisty Berliner always, said oh that\u2019s not necessary. She didn\u2019t want to do that. And the reason prevailed and they did it. And it\u2019s a darned good thing because later on we heard these boots on the stairs. My mother and I were inside the pantry. With her arms around me, shaking like aspen leaves when we heard those pounding boots coming up the stairs. And we heard somebody say \u201cOh, don\u2019t ring there. There\u2019s no Jews there\u201d and they went on up. I believe they got her son, either that time or later. And I don\u2019t know. She and her daughter must have ended up dead. It was just dreadful. Anyhow, that is a moment that is probably the most frightening moment of my life. And we crept out of the pantry. The Nazis had gone. And then shortly thereafter 1t must have been that word came that we should go to H\u2014from my father who had at this point reached Havana. And, and he said, he wrote, go to Hamburg. Go to the Cuban consulate and get all your documentation and soon I\u2019Il be able to send for you. And so my mother and I took the\u2014and early morning train. It was still dark, from Berlin to Hamburg."

(laughs) I thought that was great. Well then we trudged through Hamburg and we went to the consulate. Everything was fine. It was lunch time. And I was getting hungry. And my mother, everywhere she saw a restaurant it said Jews aren\u2019t wanted, forbidden to Jews. And she was a mother first and she decided the heck with all of this.

You know now I have to go back to childhood memories, before I continue with this. Let me delve back. You know we started moving from one nice apartment to one less nice, to one less nice, to a furnished room. I remember a lovely place we had. Geisenhimerstrasse is the place. It was outside of Berlin and it was a little apartment with a balcony but it was on the ground floor. And I remember, at that time I was four years old. And I was just starting, having this impulse to draw pictures. And so I remember sitting at a little table, on a little chair on this balcony. It had a hedge around it to separate it from the road. And I would sit there with paper and pencil and scribble and scribble happy as could be. I remember that clearly. The first apartment I Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 23 remember. In fact, my first memory was waking up from a sleep and my parents were in the next room packing and we were going to Denmark the next day for a little trip. That was my very first memory.

It was raining cats and dogs and the apartment, the whole neighborhood was now filled with Turkish labor immigrants. They, you know you\u2019ve read about the Turks that, and they were having a very hard time and foreigner hating Germany you know. And there were these Turks in that apartment.

And then of course he couldn\u2019t\u2019 take us right off because there was a sort of Cuban version of Ellis Island called Tresconia. I think it means three horns in Spanish but I\u2019m not sure. And again with a child\u2019s different look at things, I thought it was fantastic. And it was this ancient garden with palm trees. I had never seen palm trees before and they were so wonderful I thought. And we had the, really unpleasant conditions. There were no mattresses. And we slept right on the metallic springboards with a sheet over it, but it was the tropics. It was very hot and it wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable to me.

Rented furniture. We had rocking chairs. The one thing I remember inside was a tray with tall glasses from Woolworth\u2019s with big red dots on them. Anda decanter and this, these are the tropics. It looked so good and so inviting and the house inside was cool. And these wonderful old tile floors. Well we couldn\u2019t believe it. He had totally tricked us. We were so happy, we didn\u2019t know what to think. He had his little joke. He was so happy too to have his family again. And I must tell you. This is where my guilt complex comes in. While others were having this great sorrow and this great pain in Europe and they were going to ghettos and concentration camps, we were having this little idyll lasting some, over a year or so of pure happiness. Of course my father had money worries, but the important thing is we were together and we were safe and Cuba at that time long before Castro, was a wonderful place to be."

There was \u2014 so he decided to leave us with his relatives in Dresden. So we went there. The lady was an eccentric. She had about 13 cats or more and this big old rambling country house in Dresden. She had two sons. I remember one of them was called Reiner and I can\u2019t remember the other one. They were much bigger boys. I was just a little kid. And they played two tricks on me. They gave me something that looked just like honey and they said this is good, Ruth. Why don\u2019t you eat it. I was such an ignoramus. | ate it and it was laundry soap. To this day I can remember the taste. It was so awful. The other thing they did which did not Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 37 endear them to me, they would take, put me in a potato sack and move me around the garden. Just drag me you know. That wasn\u2019t too good. I was scared to death of them. Not having any siblings, particularly brothers you know. And the other thing is I developed a typical childhood cold and some German families had some peculiar ideas of how to raise children. This woman\u2019s idea of curing me was to tie me hand and foot in bed and put a lot of blankets on me to sweat it out of my system. Well my mother was horrified. She felt like she was very vulnerable. She was there because she didn\u2019t have a penny to her name. Her husband was struggling in Berlin to find a job and a place to live. All she had were these people. She didn\u2019t want to offend the lady but she didn\u2019t\u2019 want to desert me either. So while I was lying there sweating and pleading for her to release me and she was sitting there crying. But she didn\u2019t\u2019 have the nerve to untie me. This was a very unpleasant memory. And remember this was not done by a Nazi. This was done by what was considered a good German parentsega, not my mother but this lady who was related to my father by marriage. It was her husband who was a cousin of his. And so my memories of Dresden and it was also ghastly winter weather and depressing and I was cold most of the -- it was just simply a horrible memory"

Here he was at this point in his 50s, Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 43 and he looked for any kind of job. Salesman. He worked at the Savoy Plaza Hotel in the basement as sort of janitorial working. There he was once a well set up gentleman with his little fortune. And here he was now practically a janitor and guys half his age who referred to him as hey Al, you know. And it was a great come down or I don\u2019t know but he was very gallant about the whole thing. He got used to it. He struggled with it. He put up with it. He fought and he finally ended up creating his own position with a German language newspaper, the Stats Sanctunk und Herald (German), a Knight Ridder paper and he found a job in their advertising department. And with his contacts back in Germany and his knowledge of German, he became the advertising director for the ads from Germany, big industry ads. And I wanted to explain how it was possible for him to go back to Germany on business trips after all that had happened. And this was of course after the war when Germany was being built up again. He knew the high commissioner and he had contacts from business before. And he managed to get some fabulous ads for the paper and he did this twice a year for seven years until he died of lung cancer. And the way that he could do this, as I explained before is that he had had 40, almost up to \u2014 no more than 40, mid 40s. He had had a good life in Germany. This was a nightmare that came upon him in middle age and he had had to adjust to it. He had to understand it wasn\u2019t going to go away. That he had to get away from there. He had not been in the camps. He had not had the experience. And so he was able to come back and deal with the post war Germans. He was not eaten up by hatred or revulsion like so many rightfully were. You know.

It just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s how it was pronounced in Germany, Rutt. I didn\u2019t\u2019 like it. It wasn\u2019t enough for me. I didn\u2019t feel like just Ruth. You know or Ruth and so she and I took a walk on Riverside Drive because I told her I wanted to get a middle name. And I realized that every American I knew had a middle name. I only had one and it was only one syllable so I said Jill will you help me find a name. So we walked and we started with the A\u2019s naturally.

But he did marry an artist as his first wife. She was prima ballerina of the Berlin Opera. Her name was Elizabeth Grube. She was non-Jewish and she was a very good dancer. They were married about four years and then she ran off with a stage designer, a Greek stage designer.

I passed that for the day courses. And then my parents took me aside and said Ruthie, there just isn\u2019t the money there. You\u2019re just going to have to take a day time job, go to night school. Well I was very upset about that. All my friends who were able to go to Cooper Union were going in the day time. And it was very hard for me to work at jobs, sales jobs. The worst job I ever had as a very young person, oh this was ghastly was in some horrible neighborhood downtown where we spray painted little monkey masks. You know the little faces on little monkeys. We spray painted them. Every time I sneezed I\u2019d get out a different rainbow color. It was unhealthy and unpleasant. It was I would say factory work. It was just ghastly. Well I did, the jobs I got in those days were not very good. And it was a great strain to work at that and then go to night school. And after a while I, I just dropped out. And much to my regret, really. And then I, eventually after many lesser and less enjoyable jobs, I found a lovely secretarial job with Paramount theaters in the Paramount building in Times Square where I stayed for four years and I really enjoyed it. I was ordering candy for the theater chains and doing secretarial. Candy was bigger with them than the films were. They got more revenue from that. And I stayed with them. Oh I must tell you how I got the job at the State Department in Washington. Would you like to hear how I got that?"

Maybe my past experiences in dealing with hardships gave me the strength to endure this terrible shock of losing him so young and being in charge of three young lives. And I must say they had such good character. It was so easy to raise them. I thoroughly enjoyed being a parent and I must say they didn\u2019t give me much grief at all. They were good kids. I raised them instinctually. All of us do and there\u2019s no handbook for being a parent. And it came out well."

            "answer": "Well there are several versions which I don\u2019t know that I want to go into. One is that he died in a swimming pool and the other one\u2019s a different version that somebody got to him from North Korea and so not knowing the full truth it\u2019s best not to. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. Pll never know the truth so I can\u2019t really tell you. But anyway the idea being that when he had finished his tour, we were going to reunite and I was going to show him my home town. So you can imagine the state of mind I was in when I went years later with my mother. I remember being very unhappy and very unpleasant and very crabby and I apologized to her. I said Mutti, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just so sad. I pictured this so differently. And she said apologies are not necessary my dear. I fully understand. But then after I had gotten there and discovered that it was, everything was so different from what I remembered and people were pleasant. And this was before the return of the skinheads. At this point, I thought oh my this is marvelous. The new Germans are great. This is a democracy. How nice. And it was only later when I was back home a few years later and I read about these outrages against the Turkish laborers and the skinheads you know setting houses on fire. And just being generally nasty to the alien labor forces that they had. And skinheads with swastikas and what not and I got so fed up and so disgusted you know. So as you can see, I\u2019ve always had a roller coaster feeling about Germany. It\u2019 ll always be with me. My daughter said maybe you should see a therapist and I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know. Should I or shouldn\u2019t I, I don\u2019t, she thinks I should."

And then I read an article in the Washington Post about the new holocaust museum. And the idea that I adored, in those days they still had those pass machines when you would take a one of those ID book, cards or pamphlets from the machine and you would read you know people who had been through the Holocaust and you\u2019d read their story. And in those days you would have to go to a different floor and get the second page and you couldn\u2019t just read the whole thing. As you went from floor to floor the fate of this person unfolded. They got rid of those machines because they were used to death, they died. They got rid of them. They were always breaking down. Now you get the whole little passbook and unless you control yourself and wait you can read the whole thing while waiting for the elevator. The idea being that you didn\u2019t know then would this person make it or would they perish. And that was rather dramatic. I thought the idea was phenomenal you know. And then I read that they were looking for volunteers and all of a sudden it was like bong. All of a sudden, I was interested. My heart was in this. This is something that I felt I could do so well with my background. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 69 And so I wrote a letter and they replied. And I came for an interview and I was accepted. I was thrilled. I loved the museum. I love what they\u2019re doing and I enjoyed being a volunteer and were it not for my bad ankle and knee, I would be here much more often than I am.

And that this really did happen. There\u2019s enough evidence in this museum to show that. I love that. That somebody took the trouble to build it and, and I love the architect who went to the camps and got the ideas for the architecture directly from the camps. James Engle Freed. And I love what he did. It\u2019s a magnificent building. And going, the strange is when I applied, I said please don\u2019t put me near scenes of horror. I don\u2019t\u2019 want to see it.

Maybe I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 72 read more into it because of my background, but maybe not. There is a mixture, sort of fear and shame and more. It\u2019s a combination of impressions, when I look at the young faces. They know what their country has done and I\u2019m sure they feel terrible about it. And they feel embarrassed and guilty but eager to see this and afraid to see it.

Some people want that. Others, myself included, do not think it\u2019s such a great idea. But whenever I think it\u2019s appropriate to a particular group of people in a given situation, I\u2019ll mention. There is one place, my favorite in the whole museum and it\u2019s a remember the children Daniel\u2019s house. That is my favorite exhibit because that 1s partly Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 73 my youth growing up in Germany. Many of the things in that exhibit it\u2019s like walking through a series of stage sets. Remind me of my own childhood. Although it didn\u2019t have the terrible ending that are pictured there like the ghetto and the camps. I left before them. But every often when I have a nice family who brought their children, Ill put the emphasis on look at the children and they\u2019!1 say that\u2019s just like my childhood was I grew up under those circumstances and then I say but I didn\u2019t\u2019 have the sad ending. But I says basically remember my own childhood there and this, the children look at me with big eyes. It\u2019s very useful to be able to do that convincingly because it\u2019s the truth you know. And I do that when I like a given group and I want to add to their knowledge. I don\u2019t feel that I want to go around with a badge that says survivor though you know. I don\u2019t want to do that. Was anything else on this subject that you wanted to know. Oh my interaction with people. The sweetest little peasant woman from some East European country talking Yiddish came. She had misplaced some object, had lost something that her grandmother had given her and it had been found in the lost and found and I got it for her and handed it to her. And she didn\u2019t speak the language. She grabbed my hand and kissed it and I thought that was the sweetest most touching thing. And I was smiling the rest of the day. I\u2019m embarrassed but also touched. And you meet so many different people. Sometimes you see a lady middle aged, totally overcome. It was like we would come out of the hall of remembrance and she was just standing there and her shoulders were shaking. She was leaning against the column, her face to the column and I just gently. I know we\u2019re not supposed to touch the public but sometimes a human touch 1s sort of instinctive and I just gently patted her shoulder and stood by her and she calmed down. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 14 You had the feeling that you are an ambassador between the museum and the public and, and you try to be a good influence and help and represent the museum and all of that.

I\u2019m very grateful to her. Had I looked at that, I probably couldn\u2019t continue working at the museum. You would have to shield yourself against the utter horror. There\u2019s limits to what you can take. In fact I\u2019m going to travel to eastern Europe in the late fall and on the way there will be a chance to go to the camps and I\u2019m not going to go. I don\u2019t\u2019 think I could face it. It\u2019s enough that I go through the permanent exhibit. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t\u2019 care, but maybe because I care too much that I don\u2019t want to go."

From the German to English. Unfortunately I\u2019m not ready yet for word processors and things like that. I understand the museum might give courses on that. I\u2019d like that. I\u2019m doing it by hand. It would be lovely if I could just sort of tick it off like this."

            "answer": "Fascinating. For instance, I\u2019Il tell you there is this wonderful video on. It\u2019s called \u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d and it\u2019s about the wonderful French Huguenots mountain village of Le Chambon and they\u2019re legendary for their aid that they gave to Jewish refugees. They\u2019re famous for it. In fact if you\u2019d like me to lend you this, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s called \u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d. Ad it\u2019s this very stirring which I\u2019ve always been so moved by that this particular translation is of a man who was a French Swiss who worked at Le Chambon during the war, helping numerous children, carrying for them, nourishing them, helping them escape. And how they village of Le Chambon worked with him. And it was a very famous priest. Father Trocm\u00e9, legendary and he\u2019s mentioned in this manuscript. So I have been so thrilled to be working with this material because even before I knew of the museum, I was touched by the story of Le Chambon and how they helped the Jews there. They were all Huguenots, not Catholics. It\u2019s very thrilling material. First I did the story of his wife, and now I\u2019m doing his story and it\u2019s absolutely thrilling work. And it shows you the heroism that people are capable of. This is a particularly, this is not the story only of suffering and victimization but it\u2019s what one man with good will can do to prevent horrors from happening and to get, he always emphasizes in this report that he didn\u2019t do it by himself. He had the help of the village people and other priests and many others. But he had this gift of networking which is a gift. And he used it to full advantage to save many lives. And you can imagine how honored I am to be working with this story. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 80"

            "answer": "Maybe that\u2019s the wrong phrase. I just have the feeling that it engages my heart, my emotions. I\u2019m fully committed to bring out the best that this museum has to offer and share it with the public. I have had no dealings with creating it or furnishing or anything but what I am able to do as 1s be in between the museum and the public and convey to them some of what the museum is about. And I feel that I am uniquely qualified to do that. And that is satisfying."

You get the occasional oddball that says something horrible, but fortunately they are few and far between. The majority of people are absolutely enthralled by it."

I don\u2019t know if people know that they can go up to the second floor and look through these books of what others say about it. At the, you know at the end of the exhibition that crosses the Hall of Remembrance and then when you go through the little corridor there these big books that you can write in. And it shows you that the public really does appreciate it."

            "answer": "Definitely. ? ve had numerous, we have one little gimmick that\u2019s very satisfying. Each one of us receives every month, ten tickets. Now you know the tickets are free but you have to wait in line for a long time. And it\u2019s very convenient to be handed a ticket. Now I don\u2019t always have ten family members or intimate friends that I give these tickets to. So I keep them in my purse and when I\u2019m at the museum. And when that hour finally arrives when there\u2019s no more tickets, and I see some desperate young visitor from a far off country, I\u2019m so glad I could slip her ticket or him and oh, right after the Oklahoma bombing, I had the Attorney General of Oklahoma. He was in the news just the other day. I forget his name right now. It\u2019s Boswerson or something. Very nice man. And he looked at me. I had no idea who he was. And he said oh what a shame. He said I can\u2019t get any ticket and I\u2019m only here for a day. And I said where are you from. He said Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ruth Harvey 82 Oklahoma. He said I\u2019m the attorney general. No, he didn\u2019t\u2019 say that then. He just said he was from Oklahoma and I liked the way he looked. He seemed like a nice human being so I reached into my pocket and I said here let me give you this little pass. I hate for you to be here for nothing. And he thanked me so much and dashed off. Hours later he found me where I was collecting tickets or something and said I want to thank you so much for making it possible for me to see. He said I\u2019m the Attorney General of Oklahoma and I said oh my god, I said your poor state. I\u2019m so sorry for what you had to go through. And it was just like instant friendship. We never see each other again. But I don\u2019t\u2019 think we'll ever forget each other. And it\u2019s that sort of human story that is so enriching you know. And many other instances that I can\u2019t remember of a direct contact with another life, brief but you don\u2019t\u2019 forget it. I just said I can\u2019t remember. But you know what I mean. Different various instances remain in my mind."
