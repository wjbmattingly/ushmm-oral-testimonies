They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t tell the German that he escaped. So I took his name. And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus, out, out, out. And they took us to another ghetto, Lodz. Lithmanstadt. They call it Lodz, Lodz ghetto. There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard. There was a- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms. And they told me, you have to be extremely, extremely careful.
