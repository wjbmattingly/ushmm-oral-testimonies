more. But when I lived there, it was a town of about 60,000 people, of which 22,000
were Jewish. I went to a Catholic school. My father didn’t want to send me to the
Hebrew gymnasium because it was co-educational with the boys. So I went to a
Catholic school. And I find the arrangements that they had were very smart. On 44

girls, we were 20 Jewish. So we had a religion class. We had to leave the class and
go to another, we Jewish girls. And we had a rabbi who came and gave us a lesson
in religion. I liked the priest better, he was young and handsome. We had to stand up
at the beginning of our classes and listen. Not say it, but li — stand in the respect of
their prayer. And we had to stand up before we left for home. That was the only
thing we had to do. Otherwise, we had our religion class. And we had a few Jewish
teachers, even though it was a Catholic school. We didn’t have nuns. The only — the
only way they could prove that it was a Catholic school was that we had the prayer
in the morning and the prayer in the afternoon, which we didn't participate in, we
just stood and listened, and that was all. Was a very fine school, and a very fine
education.
Q: Let’s talk a little bit now about your family.
A: My family.
Q: How long — how far back can you go, of generations that lived in that town?
A: Well, I— I know my grandfather, who lived there, and my grandmother, who
later, when she was older and ill, stayed with us in our house. My father, as a 16 —
my grandmother, poor, limping grandmother, who had one leg shorter than the
other, she was very small, had 11 children, of which 10 were boys and one girl. She
was very happy when they took off and went to America. The boys. I know of two

were here, living here in — in New York, but my father came here as a 16 year old
boy. He was a very handsome boy and he was addicted to the theater, to the Yiddish
theater. So when he came to New York, besides learning a trade to become a tailor,
he joined the Yiddish theater in New York. And I grew up on stories of great Boris
Tomachevsky and Luther Adler. And he played with a young boy by the name of
Muni(ph) Weisenthal, which was pel — Paul Muni later. And I still remember my
father in Poland, in a Jewish theater, where he played King Lear.
Q: King Lear in Yiddish?
A: In Yiddish, absolutely. But, after staying in New York City for 11 years in very,
very poor conditions, he got sick. He had TB. And at that time TB was not easily
cured as it is now, so he was so frightened that he took a boat and went back to
mama, to Poland. He never returned. But we lived with New York times all the
time and I lived with the stories of the Yiddish theater, and that was my dream when
I was a young girl, to come to New York.
Q: What was your father’s name?
A: Isadore(ph). I remember him in the Yiddish theater, and so was my mother. I
think they met in the Yiddish theater. My father was an extremely handsome man.
Q: Well, the — the picture doesn’t show up on the tape.

A: Yeah, I know. He — he did very well in his profession, he was very successful, he
had a good business, and he had workers working for him. He specialized in ladies’
coats and suits, no dresses, and he used me as a model. He would say, put on a coat
and go for a walk. My mother helped him in the business and he was very
successful. My father by — he — he used to call himself a — a — a socialist. He be — he
belonged to the Polish socialist party. And when the Russians cov — came into our
town, I was very concerned about him because he was wealthy, very well known.
They didn’t touch him. They didn’t touch him. He closed his business and he was
sitting home, working there, and he survived. I was afraid they will take him to
Siberia. And I shouldn’t have been afraid, it would have been better had they — had
they taken him. Well, they didn't. When the Germans came in, he became one of the

family, nobody survived. I’m the only one, unfortunately. From my husband’s
family, his father and mother came to Przemysl during the war, we got them there.
We thought we can take better care of them. I took them to the train.
Q: So, what was your mother’s name?
A: Anna. She was a very, very smart, clever woman. She was the one to — who

praying, until I rebelled one day and I said I don’t want — I want to go where women
are, and to this day it bothers me when I sit together with men. But my mother was
less religious. She would be in the store on a Friday and she would forget to light the
candles, or couldn’t go home. She would say to me, go home and light the candles,
so Father wouldn’t know. He didn't like it. He was — he was a — in his way he was a
religious man, yes. He — he —I used to love Seders because my father would come
home freshly shaven from the barber, smelling of powder and — and we would sit at
the table and he would say dom(ph) sefredyah(ph) and instead of doing that, I
would do this [indecipherable] always — he always smiled at me when we did that.
Q: These are the plagues?
A: Yes. He was very well known in town. My father had — my mother was the brain
of the family, my father was the heart. He had a big heart. From the age of 10 to 18,
I went every summer with my father for a whole month of July, to the Polish Tatra
mountains. There was a resort in that Polish Tatra mountains on the — almost on the
Czechoslovakian border, where people with TB would come, first of all because of
the weather. It was marvelous, it was in demand. Secondly, they had special waters.
There was one water that was specially for people with lung problems, and the water
was later bottled and sold in pharmacies. So we went every year, and he would
always rent two rooms. I never slept in the same room where my father was. I was

not allowed to enter the room where my father slept, he was so afraid that I might
catch the TB from him, although he was under doctors’ care. A — but nevertheless,
he always rented two rooms with an adjoining ba-balcony, and I — one was for me,
and one was for him. And we would fight constantly, he and I, constantly. Every
year at the end of the season when we were in those mountains, I would say, I will
never go with you again. He says, if you pay me I wouldn’t go with you. Until the
next year. And the next year, May came, I saw his eyes looking at me and he says,
are you Starting to pack? And we went. We left Mother in the store, she was
probably very glad to get rid of us. And —
Q: What was the name of the town?
A: Przemysl.
Q: No, no, the — th-the resort in the mountains.
A: Oh, the resort. That’s hard, Szezawnica, s-z-c — c-z-a-w-n-i-c-a, Szezawnica. It
was a place that was — there was no train station there, there was no bus. So we went
to the nearest town and we hired a taxi and we would go there. And the reason I am
telling you this is because I was about 14 years old, I always travel with my music, I
played piano. And my father had very few requirements of me, but one of those was
that he rented always for me, a piano, where I could go and play an hour a day,
practice my piano. We arrived to the station, and those Jews living there knew him,

because he was there year after year after year. So they were waiting for him to
arrive. And as soon as we arrived, they would tell him something, something very
important, and he would turn to me and say, do you have your music with you? I
said, yes, of course I have my music, I always have it. He says, well, there is a—a
family, a mother and father, Jewish family and two children and they are very poor
and they don’t have enough food. So I, being a spoiled little thing, I said to him,
Father, I don’t understand, if they are so poor, why do they go to a summer resort?
Which was a logical question. But he was enraged. He says, you mean to tell me that
the — only the wealthy can have good air and good waters? We have to do something
about it, he decided. He says to me, do you have that pink chiffon dress that the
dressmaker just finished for you? I said yes, I have it. He looked at my hair and he
said, we’ ll take you to the hairdresser and have some very nice curls made. And I
said, what do you have in mind? You’re going to play the piano, we’ll give a concert
and we’ll collect money. I said no, I’m not going, I am not prepared to give any
concert. I was 14 years old. He says, we will find a boy who’ll play the fiddle. And
if they see a girl and a boy playing, who cares whether you playing well or not?
We'll collect the money. And here’s exactly what he did. He hired a place, he found
a boy, I played with my music because I didn’t memorize anything, and he, he didn't

people, a lot.
Q: You had said that he was politically oriented.
A: Yes, he was a social — he used to say he was a socialist and I would — I would
joke and say, a wealthy socialist.
Q: So you would describe your family as being upper class?
A: Yes, yes, yes, I would describe as being — he never mastered the Polish language
and I felt very embarrassed because of that. He — he spoke English, he spoke
Yiddish, and they spoke Yiddish to each other, but never to me.
Q: What did you speak to him?
A: Polish. And I offered him that I would teach him Polish. He didn't want to. But I
found later that the knowledge of Yiddish was very helpful to me. I didn’t know I
knew it. When I came to Munich, Germany, and I taught piano in a DP camp, I had
children from all over Europe, but they didn’t speak German and they didn’t speak
Polish. So I didn't know how to reach them. I started with my broken Yiddish, and
that’s the way I reached them. That’s the mail.
Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in?
A: I lived like you would live here, let’s say on Connecticut Avenue. The main
street of the city.

Q: And did you —
A: It was a lovely city. We never had any crime, we never had to lock our doors
when we went out. When — there was one taxi standing at the station and if
somebody took that taxi, the whole town knew it. At the same — at this — at the house
where we lived, downstairs were three — two young ladies. They were not so young,
they were older. Unmarried, who had a — a store with sweets; candies and things like
that. And that was my mother’s favorite store, she — there was a chair for her there
and she would always sit in the evening and chat with them. I never had to pay for

A: Music, yes, where I studied piano, yes.
Q: Did you notice when you were younger, even in those eight grades or 1n the

something said against Jews, or against us as Jewish girls. As I said, we — I had — I

particularly — but, in Przemysl, the city is divided by a river. A river with very, very
clean water. And in the summer we had kind of a arrangement. They built a wooden
— wooden cabanas at the edge of the river. And it was done very smartly, that you
didn’t feel that you have a proper figure and you wanted to have a b — wear a
bathing suit. You could go to the wood cabana, there were steps there going down
into the water. You could emerge in the water without being seen by anybody. And

was a very peaceful life, until the war.
Q: Yeah. What kind of relationship did you have with your mother?
A: My mother used to whack me, until I was 16 years old. And she used a coppered
beater as her favorite object, and I got my beating only for the piano lessons. You
see, I had a notebook. For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was
my next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson. If I had a A ora
B, it was all right. If I had a C, I was licked. And yet, she was my best friend. When

mother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant. She didn’t — she didn’t bat an eyelid. She
said, then we have to get an abortion. She went with me. She got the doctor. In
Poland, to get an abortion 1s like to spit. As long you have enough money, no
problem. She got the women doctor and another doctor who was present. She took
me there. I got an abortion. She says, you cannot have a baby now. And if I had that
baby, I wouldn’t have survived, that’s for sure. And after that she said to me, you
can rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home. And we walked home, and on the
way there she must have seen that I was tired. She said — we passed an ice cream
parlor and she says, would you like some ice cream? So we sat down. She was a
very smart woman. She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home.
Walking, mind you. And then, when we came home, she said, Father must not know
about it. You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down. But at dinnertime I want
you dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father. And this 1s exactly
what I did. He never knew that. He was much more sentimental that she was. She
was a very great realist. She knew what is going on. Very smart woman.
Q: What was her family name?
A: Weitz. W — w-e-i-t-z, Weitz.

you first hear of him? Were you aware of that?

were — this seemed so far away. Total — we were totally not concerned about it. Even
in ’38 I wasn’t concerned about it. In ’39, when he finally attacked Poland, this is
when I realized that very hard times are coming.
Q: So, up to September 1939, your life went on?
A: Was very peaceful, very peaceful. I met my husband when I was 14 years old. I
had a cousin who lived in Lvov. She was a perpetual matchmaker. And she probably
figured out, here is that boy who — he was a — kind of tutoring children on the upper
floor where she lived, and she thought he was a very nice boy, she liked him. And
here I have that cousin of mine who is 14, let me introduce them to each other. And
she did that. She invited me for — for Pesach, to come and visit with her, and I did.
And I went there and she introduced me to that boy. And he — the first thing he
asked me was to go for a walk in the park with him. And I forgot my gloves and my
hands were very cold, and I was always preoccupied about my hands because of the
piano. So we were walking in the park and he took my hands into his hands and he
say — he was — see, he said to me, I will always keep you warm. He was ready to go
to medical school, and there was innumerous clauses in Poland, as you know. And
as his brother lived in Italy, in Genoa, and was a very known dentist, he was ready
to go to his brother to study medicine. So when — he took me to the train when I left,

flowers from? And I said, well, a boy gave it to me. My father said, throw it away.
He went to Genoa and he wrote letters to me, and of course I wasn’t allowed to date
anyhow, so there was no danger of my dating, but —

A: Iam 14. And for vacation he came to Poland, so he came to us to visit us. And
my mother was absolutely crazy about him.

of course I didn’t date anybody else, and — and it — I waited for him seven years. Oh,
I — one didn’t get married, not unless your husband can support you. So I waited for
him seven years. And then he came to Poland in 1938, and he was stuck; 1939 the
war started. So that’s where our tragedy started.

the center river, was the border. The other side was occupied by the Russians.
Q: What — what side were you on?
A: On the Russian side. And —
Q: And you were in the town at the time?
A: Oh yes.
Q: What do you remember from that?

living in Lvov.

A: In 1940, that’s right.
Q: We’re talking about September °39.
A: Yes, why was I in Lvov? Maybe I was in Przemysl, I don’t remember that. I
know only that the war was, without — without pity, without — without any — they
were so — the Russians were fighting beautifully, but they had an order to leave the
whole city and move back. So they left the city and the Germans consequently
moved in. And this is when trouble started.
Q: What was your first impressions of the Germans?
A: Well, I didn't — I really didn’t realize what is going on. At first I saw some simple
soldiers in the city, the SS didn’t move in yet. And it was relatively peaceful in the
beginning. They didn't start right away with the ghetto, the ghetto was formed much
later. But my father was very depressed, he probably felt that it’s going to be very
hard. And the first thing they did is to choose a Judenrat. You know what a
Judenrat is?
Q: The Jewish council.
A: The Jewish council. And my father was chosen as one of those. So we always
thought that because he is a part of the Judenrat he is relatively safe. The first thing
that I remember is that we were sitting in our apartment, 1t was — we were not in the
ghetto yet, there was no ghetto yet. And a few German soldiers knocked at our door

and I came to the door. And my father was sitting in the dining room at the table.
They didn’t see him. And I came to the door and they ask me whether there are any
men in the house? And I said no, it’s just me and my mother. And they looked at
me, they — they thought about it for a moment, and they left. They didn’t go in. Had
they gone in they probably would have taken my father, that was the first time I
saved him. And —
Q: You are 22 years old now —
A: Yes, I was 22 years old.
Q: — in 1939.
A: And my father used to say, I don’t know, I don’t like it, I don’t like it at all. They
come to the Judenrat and they ask for a lot of money. You know, they wanted
money from the members of the Judenrat and you had to collect the money to give
it to them to pacify them. And then my father came home one day and said, I think
we are going to move to a ghetto. They are forming a ghetto.
Q: Were there many refugees from other parts of Poland in Tremisz(ph) by then?
A: Not by then. They came later. They formed the ghetto on the other side of the
city, which was not primarily Jewish. In other words, it was not occupied by Jews.
And —
Q: Well, that was a little later.

A: That was later.
Q: Yeah, let’s, before we get to the ghetto —
A: Yes.
Q: — let’s talk about the — what the conditions were. Up t — in the late 30’s what were
you doing? You were still going to that music school?
A: Yes, I was going to the music school.
Q: You were going to the music school all the way up to the time of the war
starting?
A: No. There was one year when I took off. I forgot to tell you about it. I— I ask my
father permission. I wanted to study cosmetology in Lvov, as I had that cousin and I
could have stayed with her. It took a year. My father was terribly against it, he said,
you want to become a hairdresser? I said, no, as a hairdresser, I want to study
cosmetology. Well, he said all right. So I went to Lvov and I spent a whole year
there. And that was in 1938. And it was a very happy year, very nice year. I worked
there and my — when my husband would come for occasion, he would teach me
about skin layers, because he was — he was a medical student, so he knew more than
I did. And I spent that year in Lvov, and then I came back home. But —

Q: — the Germans, and how did your life change then, when the Germans first came
in?
A: Well, it became, first of all, much more complicated, because there was a
struggle for food. There was a struggle for — the insecurity, especially was very,
very, very — I mean, you didn’t know what’s going to happen the next day. They
constantly had different orders, especially with the Judenrat. I used to help out in
the Judenrat, my father asked me to come and do some work there. So I would sit
there and I would watch them. But this was relatively s — quiet the first year. When
it became really bad was when they formed the ghetto.
Q: What about your father’s business?
A: Oh, he closed his business.
Q: When?
A: He closed his business when the Russians occupied our part of — of the city,
because he was afraid that they might send him to Siberia, God forbid. So people
who owned businesses closed them most of the — most of the time they were closed.
Q: So how did he make any money”
A: Well, he sat home and he was sewing himself.
Q: And doing what with the clothes?
A: He became a talor — a tailor again, yes.

Q: Was he a Zionist?
A: Huh?
Q: Was he a Zionist?
A: No. He was very much against Zionism. You know, I had terrible discussions
with my father. I was very much in favor of Israel, state of Israel forming, and my
father did not. He said — and I very often think of his words, he said, the Arab state
will never let Israel exist. Israel doesn’t stand a chance, he said to me, and I was
very angry with him. I said, how can you say that? He says, that’s the truth, why
don’t you face it? So now whenever something happens in Israel, I think of my
father, yes.
Q: Whe — when did you decide to get married?
A: Well, when Julian came back from Italy in 1938, end of 1938, beginning of
1939, we started thinking about it, and eventually we thought, well he is here, he
doesn’t — he has no chance to leave the country and go somewhere else. We — in the
beginning we thought we will get married and then we will go to Italy or whe —
where his brother was. But his brother, when Mussolini made the pact with Hitler,
his brother felt that it’s time to leave. So the only country that gave him a visa was
Australia and he went to s — to Brisbane, which we visited him about 10 years ago,
we were there. Yeah, he was a very — he was — he was a Zionist. His — his brother

when we got married, we lived in Lvov a few months.
Q: Tell me about your wedding.
A: It was by Rabbi Levin. He was a — he was not an Orthodox rabbi, he was a —
what do you call him? Not Reformed.
Q: Liberal? Traditional?
A: Con — yeah, yeah. It was at his home. And I had — my father made me a suit, a
blue suit, and I had a white hat with a veil. And we had the reception at his parents’
home, which was a small apartment, just family. It was nice, it was really very nice.
Q: Was it influenced by the fact that the war had started?
A: Yes, absolutely, absolutely, otherwise it would have been probably much larger,
much bigger wedding, but — and we lived in a small apartment in — in Lvov, when
one day my father decided that it’s very dangerous in Lvov to be there and we have
to come to Przemysl. And he sent a — a truck with some soldiers, I don’t know, he
paid them probably, I don’t know where he found them. And they came to get us,
and we went to Przemysl. And in Przemysl we lived with them until they formed a
ghetto, then we moved to their apartment in the ghetto, and —

A: In Przemysl?
Q: Yes.
A: Not really. Not. They didn’t make any aktions, as they called it, until they
formed a ghetto, because they had them all together. You see, it was much easier for
them.
Q: Did you have any restrictions when you were seeing your husband? Privacy
restrictions because conditions had been changed — before you got married, before
you got married.
A: Restrictions in what?
Q: Well, because it was wartime, you didn’t get married til 1940.
A: Yeah. Not really —
Q: Did that limit your relationship with him?
A: No, my mother — my mother limited my relationship with him. She was — she —
she was wonderful with him, she loved him dearly. And no, no, I didn't have any
special restrictions. But we were brought up this way, that we didn’t have any
relationships unless we were married, contrary what is now.
Q: But you would say that at that time you wanted to get married, and so you were
optimistic about what the world situation —

Judenrat has to comply.
Q: Was your father very upset?

Q: How did he handle it?
A: He couldn’t do it — think about it. How do you handle it? You appease the — the
enemy. That’s the only way you could handle it. Until that night when they took the
1,000 boys from the ghetto, but there’s another story.
Q: And did you have to hand over any of your valuables, or did your parents have
to?
A: Well, I remember — I remember that we had a beautiful dining room set still. And
I remember a German woman came with a soldier looking at that apartment. And
she said to him, I want that table. There was a very beautiful tablecloth on the table,
so my mother tried to take it off and she said no, the tablecloth goes with the table.
And they took it. In other words, they could come in your house, your apartment and
whatever they — they liked, they could take.
Q: What was your reaction to that?
A: I don’t really remember my reaction. I was shocked probably, but — I couldn’t
understand it how somebody — my — my mother was much, much broadminded

about it. She says, as long they take the table, it’s all right, as long it doesn’t concern
the people. Which was smart. I wasn’t so smart at that time. But, in other words,
they could do, those wives of the officers, or SS or whatever, could come to you and
take whatever they wanted.
Q: Did you have to give up anything personal to you?
A: My personal things? Well, they — they did take jewelry yes, yes, I remember that.
But I — I have very vague impressions about that. Not until we came to the ghetto.
Q: What about the other anti-Jewish measures that the Germans put into effect, did
you have to wear an armband with the Jewish star?
A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, we wore an armband with the Jewish star.
Q: How did you feel about that?
A: You know, it’s funny, nothing. Nothing, because we all wore it. This didn’t
matter at all to us. And then when we were in the ghetto, of course, it was very
important that you do — do some work, that you do something that might justify your
existence, so to speak.
Q: What did the armband look like?
A: It was a white armband about that wide, and it had a — a blue St-Star of David on
it.

A: No. No, in the beginning when we lived in Lvov, we had a little apartment. When
we moved to Przemysl we lived with them. And then, when we moved to the

somebody and they brought them to Przemysl and we found them a little apartment
on the same floor where we lived.
Q: Where was your apartment in the ghetto, on what street?
A: I don’t remember the name of the street. It’s funny. It was a part of city that I

Q: What did you bring with you yourself when you went into the ghetto?
A: Well, we had beds. We had a bedroom set, my parents’ bedroom set, and there
was one set for us. Not set, really, beds.
Q: H-How did you bring that? On a truck?
A: I—I don’t remember. Must have been a truck, but a — must — probably my father

otherwise. But I — I really don’t remember being involved in — or worrying about
what I’m going to wear. This was so immaterial at the time. It was not important at
all. That’s funny. And yet, he and I, both of us, worked outside of the ghetto. It is a
very important part of my life. We worked in a place called — do you know German?
Q: No, but that’s all right.
A: Enklausungstella(ph). It was a place where they have specia — they had special
machines where they brought uniforms from the front, full of lice and other things
and they put them through those machines to disinfect them, to clean them. We
would march out every morning.
Q: We being who?
A: Julian and I. He was with a group of men, I was with the women. And we had
the armbands and we were not allowed to walk where people walked, but we had to
go where the cars and th — the horses were going, in the middle of the street. And
they would take us every morning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend
the whole day, and in the evening they would — in the af — late afternoon they would
bring us back. The reason why this 1s important 1s because there was one German — |
cannot talk about it — about him without crying — whom I was so grateful to. The
director of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin. He
was lovely. He said to me — he was always address me the German way, Frau

Doktor, because in German language, the woman gets the title of her husband, if he
is a doctor. So he would come to me and he would say, I am so ashamed, I am so
embarrassed, but I know I am being watched. And according to their rules, if
somebody was caught stealing something, what could you steal something there? A
dirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants. He has to give them public beating. So
one day he came to me and he said — there was a 15 year old boy there working, and
he was caught stealing the pair of socks, and he says, I am supposed to give him a
public licking. Tell him to scream as loud as he can. I will not hurt him, but I have to
pretend that I am doing it, I have been watched. I know I am being watched. So I did
that. He didn’t let me work with the — with the uniforms. He says, you are not going
to work there. You stay in the kitchen and peel potatoes. And to this day I cannot
peel potatoes without turning my head away. When the SS would drop in
sometimes, if they didn’t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they
will go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them.
Totally naked. Stand in the row — I have seen it, and if — they would look them over,
and if they didn’t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip. Anyway they
didn’t like the back, they would hit in the back. He would come running to the
kitchen and say to me, you don’t go there. I will hide you and you can take a shower
whenever you feel like it. And somebody could have thought that maybe there was a

special interest in him in me, and it wasn’t. He was — he was as much dedicated to
my husband as he was to me. He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near
Berlin, and I’m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the
rest of the war there working on that farm. Then somebody gave him out, that he’s
too good to the Jews. And one day they sent him out to the front, to the Russian
front. And the first thing I did when I got out of hiding, I tried to find out what has
happened to him. And I found a boy who was with him, and he told me that he was
killed at the Russian front. I still remember his last name, Burba, b-u-r-b-a. He was
a newspaperman. He was so nice.
Q: How old a man was he?
A: I would say 26 maybe.
Q: He was young?
A: Yeah.

nice only to me, he was nice to everybody. He really felt — he was embarrassed. He
was very nice. It shows you that even among them, you could find somebody who
was nice. So we worked there, day after day after day until — until they made another

Q: How did you know — how did you know?
A: Rumors. Rumors started that there is a concentration camp, that they gas people.
But we all believed that maybe it was exaggeration. You know, nobody wants to
believe that. So I took them to the train and it was started to rain. And my mother-in-
law had beautiful, heavy hair. She didn’t wear anything, and I had a s — some scarf
around my neck. So I took it off and put it on her. And she — she — she embraced me
and she said, you tell — tell my son that I said you will survive the war. I loved my
mother-in-law. She was the sweetest woman. The nicest person. I never heard a
word of criticism from her to any of her daughters-in-law. She was lovely. So, that
was it. That must have been in the summer of °42.

to come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women. We were not allowed

beautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroidered, which I didn’t need. I used to put
one on top of another on myself, and this way I could carry it with me. And that
Polish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish — Polish
people worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with
the machines. Her husband worked there, she would come there. And one day we
were conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying
that. And mind you, she was a total stranger to me. And I was young. And she
would say — she said suddenly to me, my God, you are so young, and you are so
pretty — I was pretty at the time — and I feel so sorry for you. If you want to hide,
come to me. I was flabbergasted. I says, do you realize what you are saying? Do you
know that if you are caught, they put you to death? She said, I don’t care, I’m not
afraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. That was our luck. Well, from that day on,
Julian tried to find out where they lived. And they lived on the other side of the city,
quite a distance from us. Her husband would come every evening to the ghetto — is it
working? — to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and

thought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there. And
that was going on for some while, until November ’42, when the — when the rumors
started to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people. That

day Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out. My
father wasn’t home, because if my father had been home, he would never let me go.
So my mother said to me, you go better before your father come home — comes
home. We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour. So we
had to be — go out before the curfew. And as we were going down the stairs to go
out — there was no light in the stairway at the time, 1t was dark — I heard my father’s
footsteps, he was coming up. And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream
of that. And th — my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and
he stopped me. And I let my father pass me, and I didn't say goodbye to him. That
was the — the worst thing, I think, in my life. But before we go to that, I — I have to

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer
collent — collection interview with Lena Jurand. This is tape number two, side A.
A: Well, there was one requirement of the SS. One day they came to the Judenrat,
and they required in a very specific way, they wanted the Judenrat members to do
their dirty work. They needed 1,000 boys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes.
And that was the only time I saw my father crying. I opened the door, he was
standing there crying, and I said, what happened? And he was telling me, and I said

to him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them — them 1,000 boys. And he
said to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can — how can I go to
one mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay? Am I
God? I said, you have to do it, because if you don’t do it, you know what will
happen. The Nazis will take this — this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000
on the way. And he said, you are right. And they let them have 1,000 boys during
that particular night. Nobody slept, of course. Of course the boys were never seen
again. And I went out in the morning, about six o’clock in the morning, outside.
There was not a living soul, nothing. Total stillness. There was not a bird, not a
wind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn
you, wherever you are. This is not the God I want. I don’t want any part of you. And
what’s more, I don’t want you to save me. That was one thing. As you see, it didn’t
happen. The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the
Judenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train. And I went wild.
So I ran to the Judenrat. We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and
they said to me, don’t go in. He is a wild animal. He just shot some people, he will
shoot you. And I couldn’t care less. I went in. I didn’t knock at the door, I just
opened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday. He was the most
beautiful young man I have ever seen. Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking,

one hand, in the right hand, he had a — a gun that was obviously shot a short time
ago, in the other a whip. I opened the door, he didn’t even look at me. And I didn’t —
didn’t say anything, I was just standing there. He said to me, what do you want? In
German. So I answered in German. I said, I came to inquire about my father. And I
tell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken. He still didn’t
look at me. He wasn't interested at all in what I was saying. What puzzled him was
that I used such a good German language. That impressed him. He said to me, where
did you learn German so well? I said, well German was my best foreign language, I
had it eight years in high school. And I — I really risk a lot, because I was getting
fresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe? Then he looked at
me and he said, what about your father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to
Auschwitz. He called two germ — two Jewish policemen and he said, where is that
man? So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz. He said to
me, you go home and wait. I promise you I will get your father. I didn’t have any
other — I had to go. I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother.
And when I told them, they said, don’t believe it. Nobody has ever come out of the
train going to Auschwitz. And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside.
About 10 o’clock at night we heard some footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought

my father home. Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they
started calling his name Salzburg. My father was so fatumult that he didn’t even
react to that. But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn’t that your name? He
said yes. So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen
brought him home. He was unconscious for about two days. He didn't know what
was going on. After he got better and he realized that he is home, he took my hand,
and he said thank you. So I gave him a —I gave him a-about a year of miserable life,
but life. I still to this day don’t understand what made this German keep his word. It
was puzzling to me. But he did. They stopped the train, actually. Nobody believed it.
Those are the two things I wanted to tell you about our ghetto experience. Now,
going back to coming out of the ghetto —
Q: Be-Be — before we do that, let’s talk a little bit about —

A: Well, we had enough food, because first of all my father was a member of the
Judenrat, and second we had money to buy the food. But there was a lot of poverty.
There were — they were — you saw in the ghetto on the streets, people lying. Oh yes.
Like you see some, there’s pictures now. There was — there was a lot of poverty.
Q: How large was the Judenrat, do you know?
A: The what?
Q: The Judenrat, how many people?
A: 12. 12 people.
Q: And you had said that you had worked there for a little bit?
A: Yeah, I worked — you know, keeping sc — ma — scores — names of people and
things like that. Nothing that’s very important, just whenever they needed me, I did
some work, yes.
Q: Was this in the ghetto or before the ghetto?
A: In the ghetto, in the ghetto.
Q: Okay. What did other people think of the Judenrat?
A: Well, what do they think? They probably resented it up to a certain extent,
because whenever the Germans needed something, they went to the Judenrat, and it
was a vicious circle, and the Judenrat had to accommodate them, to keep peace.
They thought they would; of course, they didn’t. And also, everybody was resentful

to a certain extent because they thought that the Judenrat is safe, and it wasn’t. It
was just delaying it a little bit.
Q: Did you know other people on the Judenrat?
A: Oh yes, there was — there was — we had a neighbor who was a — a doctor and her
son was a lawyer, he was a member of that Judenrat.
Q: And what were their — what was that name?
A: Blech, b-l-e-c-h. They were good people, and I don’t think they survived.
Q: The first name?
A: I don’t remember. I don’t remember.

A: — very much.
Q: Was he involved in the actual choosing, in the [indecipherable]
A: No, no, they were not. A — anaj — where — I mean, my father was not, because he
was too old probably for that. For that mission they usually send some Jewish
policemen with — with somebody younger. Well, the Jewish policemen had to do
their job. They thought that it — probably that they will save their life, which they
didn’t, cause a vicious circle.

the Judenrat, probably.

A: Yes?
Q: — would you sit and talk to your parents or other people that you knew about
what was happening, and —
A: We talked very little. We talked very little because there was nothing good to talk
about. I remember coming back from work. We were — we were six people in a row
working. And I happened to be at the end of the row. And a Italian officer saw me
and started walking alongside with me. And at that time I knew a little Italian, very
little, from Julian. And he said something to me and I answered and he — he took
out the package of cigarettes and wanted to treat me to some cigarettes and I says, I
don’t smoke, but may I take it for my husband? And he gave it to me. So I
remember that, but I only remember that he was very nice to us, and very apologetic.
And that really, that man who was in charge, he felt — he felt guilty, although he di —
he himself didn’t do anything, but he felt guilty for his fellow — for — for other

Q: — what did you say to this young man when you went to tell him?
A: I said that to him, I said, scream as loudly as you can. He will make believe that
he’s beat — giving you a beating, but he will not hurt you.
Q: And did the boy believe you?
A: Yes. Yes, he did. He did. Because I was older, and I was working in the kitchen.
He did. And I said to him, don’t steal any more, because you — you — it’s not worth
it.
Q: Di-Di — were people forced to watch that beating?
A: Na—I don’t remember that. No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Maybe some
watched it because — out of curiosity, but I don’t think they were forced to watch it.
Q: Did you talk to the other women in your group as you were marching to the
camp?
A: Very little. Very little. Because, first of all, we didn’t want to attract attention,
probably. You tried to be as impersonal as you possibly can. It’s funny, there were
some women with me in the kitchen working too, and I cannot remember them.
Q: What did you do in the kitchen?
A: Peeled potatoes all day.
Q: Only?

Q: Did they give you any food?
A: Yes, yes, they gave us at lunch time — noontime, some meal, so they were — we
were cooking potatoes.
Q: What did you eat for breakfast and dinner in the ghetto?
A: What did I what?
Q: What did you eat for breakfast and dinner in the ghetto?
A: I don’t remember. I don’t remember. Probably the — I don’t think we ate any
meat. I don’t remember having meat.
Q: How was your health at that time?
A: You know, this is the most amazing thing. When we were 22 months in hiding,
when we went out of the ghetto, we bribed — Julian bribed a Jewish policeman, who
probably bribed the other one, and they let us out. They closed their eyes. Julian
went with him, with her husband, who led the way, and I was behind, walking. And
as we had to pass the Gestapo building on the way there. There was no other way to
go. And there was a soldier standing, watching. At a certain moment, when Julian
was with him, he said, halt. Stopped them. So Julian said — first he thought he 1s
going to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here]
which means, I have a — I am allowed to walk after curfew. He had that document.

He says [speaks foreign language], it’s not important. Julian had a — what do you
call it? Not lantern.
Q: Flashlight?
A: Flashlight in his pocket and it just happened that the flashlight was on and the
light was seeking through. So he — that’s why he stopped him. And he thought he —
he is going to ask him for papers, and things like that. That was one thing. Then we
came there. Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November
to August °44. It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry
without the window. That pantry was very important. And then you entered the
kitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance
to the room, it had to be through the kitchen. They lived all their lives, especially in
the winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm. She
entertained German soldiers in that kitchen. We were in the room. We could not —
can you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say
a lot of word, and you cannot make a — a loud step, and you cannot be sick. We lived
like that in that room for 22 months. There was no toilet in that apartment. In other
words, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a flight stairs down,
and there was, probably for — for many people, there was the facility. People have,

you do without a toilet? I said, that’s a good question. There was a fire in th — in the
stove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And
the rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I
said, believe me, it wasn’t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of
hearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From
certain — he knew which — which place the floor was squeaking. One time an
electrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he 1s coming. And of
course he had to come to the room. So that was a — there was a mirror with a—a
piece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so
one could hide behind it. Well Julian s — only heard the words, electricity, and he
pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had
to look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs].
And he looked at the ri — lamps or something, checked. And when he left, she came
in and she says, good work guys. The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot
of things, of clothing in her house, she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her
the money for the food. Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told
her, we don’t have any money any more. So she was — she was very good about tt.
When he didn’t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a — a— a— some
soup, let’s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was. There was a

window in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come
every day with her cow to let the cow roam around. And I wouldn’t stand at the
window because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the
window and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn’t give to be this
cow. I mean, people don’t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a
German place. She spoke German. She didn’t know how to read it, but she spoke
German, for some reason she did. And once in awhile she would invite those
German soldiers over for a party. So I help her cook and bake. And then we would
hide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to — drinks to make them half
drunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep,
we would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to
other room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting
between the German and the Russian armies. Terrible fighting. The entire household
went down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian
kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn’t hear that shooting. When suddenly the
shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words
there? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are
free. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely
nothing. So I said — my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep

without fear, once. At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out
right away. I couldn’t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the
world. So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon.
My town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn’t know a living soul.
And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don’t
know, let’s just walk. And as we were walking a man approached us. And he saw
me, and he stood there and said, I don’t believe it. Aren’t you Isadore Salzburg’s
daughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going?
I said, I don’t know, we don’t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an
apartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with him. There were no beds, but it
didn’t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first
apartment. And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that
came out from hiding. And our apartment was full of people in a very short time.
You were — you wouldn’t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s — each
other stories. Of course, I didn’t have a penny to mours — to our soul. So I — one day
I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of
hiding a mile away, there was something about the — the way they were walking,
like we did. And I —I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a
lawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. We

had a — a-an apartment full of people. And she — the first thing she said to me, she
took out some money, pocket money — paper money from her pocket and said, do
you need any money” It was so unimportant. Here, have some. And that was the first
money we got. Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a — as a physician.
Q: Be-Before we go on to that, I wanted to ask you a few more questions.
A: Sure.
Q: What was the name of the family of the woman that you — that hid you?
A: Maria Dambrowska(ph). Her grandson is still alive in Przemysl and I sent him
money. Yeah. And my son graduated medical school, he decided to go to Poland for
a visit. He understands Polish, he speaks a little Polish. He went to Przemysl, she
was still alive. Of course, I gave him money for her. And I was very curious what
she will say. When he came back I said, what did she say when she saw you? He
says, Mother, you wouldn’t believe it. She put her arms around me and started to
cry. You know, that after we moved out to that apartment that the man gave us, she
couldn’t stand it. She moved out from her place and moved to the same house, to the
same floor, opposite our apartment. So she lived there with us again.
Q: How did you know when you were in the ghetto that you could trust her when
she made the offer?

being on the train. Sooner or later. I mean, is — it was inevitable that we will end on
the train.
Q: How did you know that?
A: Because so many people went. I mean, we couldn’t be an exception. Maybe not
sooner, maybe a little later. I finally — you know I found out that my father was
taken.
Q: Tell me about it.
A: Oh, I — I didn't tell you that. As we were — as we were in hiding, one evening
somebody came to the kitchen. We didn’t know who it was, we just heard the voice.
And we were — from what he said we could understand that he was a Jewish man
who happened to know her, he knew her. And you would always try to find a way,
somebody who — who could help you. So he thought he would go out of the ghetto
and go to her place, maybe she can take him. He didn’t know she had us. I felt very
guilty about that later. And as he was sitting in the kitchen and talking to her, she
asked him what happened to Mr. Salzburg? And he says, oh, he was — he and his
wife were taken on the train to Auschwitz. And when Julian heard that he put both
hands on my ears so I wouldn’t hear it, but I heard it. So later — my mother went to
Auschwitz. After the war, I met a boy who was with my father on the train, who

survived Auschwitz, and he told me that on the way to Auschwitz the SS very often
was making some — they tried to find people who had money, and people usually
had some money with them. So my father, who was very — a person that — that
caught the eye, he asks him whether he has any money. He said no. He started sh —
looking through his pockets and he found some money. So he told him to go straight
ahead and he shot him in the head. At least he was saved Auschwitz. Yeah. But she
did accomplish quite a lot I must say, this woman. Wasn’t easy to have two people
hidden in a small apartment.
Q: Why do you think she did it?
A: She didn’t do it for money, because after the war, when Julian joined the army,
and the first money I got, I went to her, and I gave it to — I wanted to give it to her,
she wouldn’t take it. I think she really felt something for us. I don’t know why, I
don’t know — I don’t know the reason, really, but she felt something. You know, to
accomplish — to have 22 months with people where you can — and I told her, when
she first told me — suggested this to me, I said, do you know what will happen to you
when you are caught? Oh, I am not afraid. She was the happy go lucky type.
Q: How old a woman was she?
A: She was older than I was. She was in her, maybe close to 40 at the time, maybe
35.

Q: And what was your relation to her husband?
A: Actually, it wasn’t her husband. You know, the funny thing is that we didn’t
know it. She was carrying his name and we thought they were married. Then we
found out that she’d left her husband and she — he was just living with her. And th —
the dangerous thing was that when he — he used to drink quite a lot. And when he
drank he would threaten her with us. And that was dangerous. So we were very
afraid sometimes about him. But she could control him somehow. And she was
funny. I used to read German papers and tell her what’s going on in the world so
when she would go to work — she worked for a German firm, she could tell them,
and she was well informed. She was a character.
Q: What kind of work did she do?
A: Some — not very important. Something in the — in the office, maybe. But she
spoke German, but she didn’t know how to read it, and she didn’t want to admit it.

you did not get sick, you or your husband?

weeks before we were liberated, I had a friend in school who came from a very
Orthodox Jewish family and the 15 people of that family were hidden somewhere.
And two weeks before the war ended somebody gave them out and they were all
shot. So this was terribly important that nobody, absolutely nobody would know.
Once it happened that I was wearing — I was wearing a housecoat, and she said to
me, come in, and I was standing, you know, at the door of the room, between the
room and the kitchen, talking to her, when her neighbor didn’t knock at the door,
just opened the door, came in and saw me. And my first impulse was to hide, you
know, but she didn’t lose her nerve. She said — she immediately had a story. Tho —
they were — those are Polish people and they were in black market, black marketing
and the police stopped them and they came here to hide for a few hours. And as soon
she got her out of the apartment, that woman. And then she managed to get her back
— she was very clever — and she said, look through the window, there they are, you
see? They left now. They felt more secure so they — they went away. Here they are
around the corner. And she made it so that the woman never suspected. [break]

time he brought me a — a ball of yarn, and I was very surprised to see it. I was
thinking what — what is — why did my mother send me a ball of yarn? Then Julian
started to rewind the yarn, there was a ring inside. But — well, I knew that the
conditions are getting worse. They — they — he told me and he heard it in — and you

A: Well, they almost — they almost — all of the Jewish population of the ghetto
almost went out to Auschwitz, unless you could hide, which was not very often.
Q: What did you know about Auschwitz at th — at that time?
A: We knew that they have — that they gas people. Oh, we knew that.
Q: Where did you get that information from?
A: Gossip. Letters probably. Maybe somebody escaped once in awhile. I — I doubt
that, but there were rumors. They were not really news, they were rumors. But you
knew that they do something with the people. They had to do something with the
people. You know, when the Russians came in, and finally I — we went out and had
this empty apartment, I met a Russian high ranked officer on the street, who said to
— the first thing he said to me is, where is your papa? Where is your daddy? He
knew him from before. He said to me, he was a fine man. Strange, how this happens
in life. I had — I had two black women come here one day with a bible. And they ask
me — they wanted to convert me, and they ask me whether I believe in God, and I
said no, I don’t. How can I? But, on the other side, I am — I am here. This is my
fourth life, you know. First life was in Przemysl as a girl, was very happy. Very
happy life, no problems. Then the second life was under the occupation, and hiding.
And the third life was after the war. And since my husband died, it’s my fourth life.

very important. When we went into hiding, we were planning it, I said to him, I
won’t go u-unless you meet my conditions. You have to have poison with you
because I will not go in German — to German’s hands alive. He says, you can be sure
Pll have it. All right. We went into hiding and there was one night when the German
cars were passing by [makes tooting noise]. And a neighbor came in and said,
Marie, you don’t have to be nervous, they’re just going from house to house looking
for Jews. Would you believe that they went from one house to another, this is the
only house they didn’t enter? There is something written in the stars. At that time
when I heard those cars and she said they are going looking for Jews, I said to
Julian, I want the poison now. He says no. When they will enter this house, Pll give
it to you. They never entered. That’s na — that’s not the end of the story. After the
war, as Julian didn’t have anything else but one pair of pant and a shirt, and he was
always a snappy dresser, he ask me to press his pants. I picked them up, and you
know the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material. And as I
picked them up, there was something stiff there. So I said to him, Julian, I cannot
press it like that, there is something in that belt, you have to take it out. What do you
think it was? Poison. And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he
doesn’t have it. I said, you promise, you don’t keep your promise. I was angry at

very good man. When they t — when he died they gave him a beautiful memorial at
Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital. He was clinical director there. And they really were very
nice. Nice people. Everybody liked him.
Q: At the time of liberation you said you slept for 24 hours, it was the first time you
could sleep.

you are afraid at night.

Then one day, somebody knocked at my door — I wonder whether she 1s still alive?
And I opened the door, and I couldn’t figure it out, whether it was a wom — a —a girl
or a man. The creature was very tall, very skinny. Shaven head, and she spoke
German to me. She was Hungarian. She said she was with a group of women from
Majdanek, Hungarian women, trying to go back to Budapest. They stopped in
Przemysl. Each one of them went to a different house, knocking at the door, trying
to get some food or something, some money. So I said to her, come in, come in. And
she came in and I gave her dinner. And she says she was a daughter of a restaurateur
in Budapest, she doesn’t know whether her parents are alive. She survived
Majdanek with a group of other girls, each one were — and I told her to bring others
here, I would have all fed them. And I tried to get together some money for her for
the train trip to — to Hungary. I don’t know whether she survived that, but I was so
—I was so touched by her looks. I mean, she wore a — a — kind of a uniform coat, and
she was so skinny. Oh, the people that we had, it was very interesting after the war
when I found those people coming out of hiding, and we all stayed together. Didn’t
matter where we slept. Then I found out that two my cousins survived the war near
Warsaw as Polish women. And the first occasion I had, I send them money and
asked them to come to me, and they came.

A: That man who came looking for — for a place to stay, he said that they took Mr.
Salzburg and Mrs. Salzburg. So that’s how I found my mother, otherwise I didn’t
know. But it was very interesting to see all those people and we would sit at the
evening and each one could write a book. And it’s amazing what people can go th —
go through and survive and still have — so those cousins of mine came to me, and the
first thing Julian took them to the army — to the — to the shoemaker to have them
make some shoes for them. One of those cousins is still alive and she lives in
Milburn, New Jersey. The other one passed away. So that was an experience.
Q: So now it’s after liberation and — and can you tell me what you did then?
A: Well, we — we — we tried to get some beds for the apartment, and the first thing
my husband bought — got for me, and I don’t know where he got it, was a concert
grand piano. And we put it in a room that was totally empty. The concert grand was
in the center of the room, so all three of us, all the two girls that came to stay with
us, all three of us played the piano, so we gave concerts.

months. In the meantime my uncle, who was in New York, found out that I am

camp in Munich, Germany. The other was a director of a DP camp outside of

happened that my husband was at that time with us in Krakow — with me in
Krakow. And I said, let’s go. So we took our dog and we boarded the Jeep and we
went to cross the Polish-Czechoslovakian border.
Q: Let’s talk about your dog. When did you get the dog?
A: We got the dog when he was in the army — with the army in Przemysl. They
went for some maneuvers to some residential prin — a [indecipherable] or
something. And the soldiers found that little puppy dog, they put him in a suitcase or
whatever and brought him to me. And I was so geared tomas food — towards food,
that when I heard something moving in that — in that little suitcase, I was sure it’s a
chicken. That was the dog. He was a puppy, and he became our baby. So I have a
picture where I’m standing on the top of a house in Cieszyn, where the border
between Poland ch — Czechoslovakia was. And Julian — w-we stayed with a
Orthodox family, it was a Friday evening when we arrived there. We stayed
overnight, they were very nice to us. And the next morning the daughter of the
household went to talk to the soldier, because we didn’t have any papers. She talked
to him and she probably convinced him, so he let her open the — the — the border, the

because of loss of his brother. So that’s my history.
Q: So now you’re back in Italy with your husband after being in New York, and
what happened?
A: I come back to Italy, yes, and we waited for our immigration visa. And I said to
my husband, what will happen if they don’t late — let the dog go to America? I
mean, this can happen. Very seriously he said, then I won’t go. He went to the
American embassy in Genoa. He got every shot given to the dog by the veterinarian
there, we got a pile of papers, we paid $50 for his — we — we came by boat here. And
we were assured the accommodations for the dogs are very good. But —
Q: What kind of a dog was it?
A: This one.
Q: No, what kind of a dog?
A: A shepherd. And he didn’t like people, so he had to wear a muzzle. And we come
on the boat and it was February, very cold. And the first thing Julian said, I want to
see the accommodations for th — my dog. So he went to the upper dock — deck and
he comes back and says, I am not going to put my dog there. It’s bitterly cold. And
we had a cabin for four people, so the dog had two bunks to sleep with.

A: Macho(ph). He was —
Q: And then you — and then you said your uncle was there and he didn’t like dogs.
A: He didn’t like — he was afraid of dogs, so we stayed with him for about a few
months in Long Island, watching the dog very carefully. And after that Julian
found — he had to make his internship here. He — we went to a place called Neptune,
New Jersey, where he worked in the hospital and where my son was born also, in
Neptune, New Jersey. And we found there is, near Neptune, New Jersey is a small
place where they don’t let cars on Sunday. And we found an Italian woman who
rented the place to us, a— a room to us with the dog, and she didn't know we were
Jewish. And then after awhile I told her and she says, it doesn’t matter. You don’t
want to park your car — you don’t want to drive your car on Sunday here. It was very
nice, very nice. And my son was born there, and then Julian wi — got —

family. And then my brother-in-law, Julian’s brother, who never had children,
started writing letters to me begging me, if I can, to have a child. So I decided

maybe I’ll try it. Never regretted it, he was a wonderful boy. It was a good
experience. But, we stayed there and then Julian found a job in Grantsville, which
is between Annapolis and Baltimore. A state hospital. And we lived there for six
years, in Grantsville. That was very happy years.
Q: What kind of practice was he having? Still venereal disease and dermatology?
A: No, no. No, he wa — since he took this — his state exam, he — he went to — to
psychiatry. This was a psychiatric hospital where we lived.
Q: So he got additional training?
A: Oh yes, oh yes. And we stayed there for six years, very happy years. And from
there we moved to Saint Elizabeth’s, where we lived for 14 years, on the grounds
of Saint Elizabeth’s hospital and my son grew up there. Very good years too, very
good years.
Q: This is in Washington, D.C.?
A: In Washington, D.C., yes. And then Julian, with time he became clinical
director of Saint Elizabeth’s hospital before he retired. And then we came to this
house. And my son lives now in West Virginia. He is also in psychiatry. He goes in
his father’s footsteps. He just directed a play. You know, we started a play —-a-—a-—
a theater in Annapolis. Yes, we bought an old garage, we bought some chairs from
an old movie house, and Julian directed the first play, which was Pygmalion. It was

a smash hit. And I helped with everything. Make-up, costumes, everything that was
to be helped.
Q: Can we talk a little bit now about some of your thoughts and your feelings about
what you went through? Do you think you would be a different person today if you
had not gone through what you did, what you experienced during the war?
A: Probably.
Q: In what way”?
A: Iam sure I would have been different. First of all, maybe I would have been
more religious, which I am not. Second, I think it gave me a certain insight into
human s-suffering, otherwise I wouldn’t have known it. I led a very sheltered life as
a young girl, very sheltered. Good life. And I didn’t know much about human
suffering. I learned a lot. So I —I think — I think in this respect — it’s hard to say that
the war was beneficial for me, it isn’t beneficial to anybody. But I think that I gained
more understanding for people. For people suffering, especially. I hope so.
Q: Are there any sounds or sights today that you hear or you see, or any smells that
kind of bring back your experience during the war, either in get — in the ghetto, or in
hiding?
A: You mean sounds?
Q: Sounds, sights, smells. Anything that triggers what you went through.

Q: Such as?
A: Or men you — even when you listen to news and you hear — or you see people
suffering in so many countries, and you think, isn’t there an end to it? I—I am
specially very vulnerable if it comes to children suffering. And when I see, let’s say
in — in Yugoslavia, the children who are without food, without medication, I suffer.
I do. Because I thought maybe — maybe we have filled out the — the suffering of
people. Maybe it’s enough. But it isn’t enough. It goes on and on and on. Why?
Even — even this last [indecipherable] the bombs, that so many Americans have
died, and local people. Any crazy person can — you know, my father was a socialist
and I used to discuss politics with him, and I — I was very angry at him because he
said he doesn’t believe in forming the state of Israel. And I said, why? He says,
because the Arabs will never, never leave them alone. Very often when I hear the
news, I can see that he was right in many ways. But, look, we will always have wars.
There will be always crazy people who will try to do so much damage. We cannot
help it. We are not responsible for everybody. I wish Julian would have lived
longer. I still feel that he didn't have any right to leave me alone. He never left me
alone in 57 years. If it wouldn’t have been for him, I wouldn’t have survived the
war. I am sure of it. I didn't — I was very sheltered all my life. I didn’t know how to

cope with it. And it was he who — who staged it, who arranged it. He was
responsible for everything, even after the war. And he left me in three days. It isn’t
right.
Q: When you were raising your son, did you — and — and let’s say when he was at
the age that you were when the war started, 22 when the war started. Did that bring
back memories for you of the war? When he became the age that you were when the
war started?
A: No, it didn't bring — I did tell him about everything, oh yes. He knew about
everything. But I — I didn’t — I didn't resent his getting older. Or I didn’t connect this
with the war in any way.
Q: Wer-Were you very protective of him when he was growing up?
A: To some extent yes, but don’t forget that he grew up, his first years were in the
country, which was very nice. We had the nice community there, rather
international. We had a doctor from Vienna, and we had a doctor from
Czechoslovakia. We had a nice group of people.
Q: Are you angry that you had to go through these very difficult times and others did
not, sitting in this country, let’s say.
A: You mean, to people who were here in this country?

A: It’s nobody’s fault. It’s not — certainly not people’s fault and I — I am very happy
that I came to this country. I love it here.
Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial in Israel’?
A: I would have killed him. I was very happy that the Israelis got him. Serves him
right. Too bad he didn't get more. And I looked at him as he was standing at that trial
and I was thinking, you know, he looked like a little Jewish man. Didn’t he? It’s
funny how it happens. But I was very glad they got him. Very. No pity.
Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today? The modern Germans.
A: I know. I wouldn’t live there if you give me millions. I don’t buy anything that’s
made in Germany. I used to tell my son, when you will be older, and you want to
marry somebody, you can marry anybody of any religion you want. But if you ever
marry a German, I will not know you. I resent them very greatly. Greatly. As a
matter of fact I had a friend who was a wife of a rabbi. She was a very dear friend of
mine, she worked with my husband in the hospital here. And her daughter, the

daughter of a rabbi went to Germany to study something and she met a German and
she married him. And she lives in Germany. And every time I saw her, I was
thinking, how can she? How can she have any relationship with those people? I
cannot. I couldn’t. I couldn’t do it. As a matter of fact, about 12 years ago
[indecipherable] we went to Vienna and Budapest. Julian had some meeting in
Budapest. When we were going to Vienna, he said to me, you will love Vienna.
Oh, you will absol — well, I hated it. Every time I was in Vienna and I had to listen
to that German and I was thinking, this is the country that gave us Hitler, I couldn’t
stand it. I enjoyed Budapest very much, but not Vienna. A funny thing happened to
us, we went to Jerusalem. There was a — Julian was supposed to read the paper,
there was a psychiatric meeting in Jerusalem, and he was reading a paper on — on
the war, something about the war. And we were sta — we were — we were staying at
the Hilton in Jerusalem and we met another couple. Very handsome man, who had
on a golden chain, a big letter chai. So you thought he was Jewish, yeah. He was a
Presbyterians minister. And I still have a letter that his wife wrote to me. We
became very friendly with this couple and we had one taxi, and the taxi driver drove
us around. And I said to [indecipherable] how come you speak English so well? He

course. And then we — we traveled to the ocean. Oh, we had a great time in
Jerusalem, I loved it. She came running to me, his wife, on a Friday and said, Lena,
quickly, quickly, you have to get ready. I want to see the Jews dancing at the wailing
wall.
Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?
A: About what?
Q: Israel.
A: I liked it very much, but — but I am not very optimistic about it — Israel. You
know, if they keep giving away — Israel is small, if they keep wanting more and
more from Israel, how long will they stay? I am — I am a little hesitant about
Netanyahu, | don’t know whether he is doing such a good job. But I love the
atmosphere. I felt very comfortable there. That —
Q: Why did you feel comfortable?
A: Because it’s such a relaxed atmosphere the Israelis have. With everything that’s
going around them, it’s amazing that they can forget about it. Or maybe not forget,
but try to forget. It’s beautiful.
Q: Are you more comfortable around people who went through the war, than those
who did not?

Q: More comfortable around other survivors?
A: You know, this is a very strange question that you ask me, and I’Il tell you why.
There is a couple here, they’re not Jewish, very nice couple who — whom I met at
some friend’s house. And they probably thought — they knew somebody else who
was from Poland, also a survivor. So they thought that if they put me together with
another survivor, I will feel mu-much more relaxed and so on. And they invited me
to dinner one time. And I went to dinner and there was the other woman. And I
didn't like her and she didn't like me, and I know it. So you never know. I — I get
beautifully along with Americans, I love Americans. I think — I don’t have to have
people who — who went through everything, as I did. Course, we enjoy it. As I was
telling you that I went to see that family in the hospital with their gra — son-in-law.
Well, the woman, the young woman was a public prosecutor in Poland. She was a
lawyer by profession and she wanted to come to this country desperately. So, we
went together for the — you know, befo — it took five years for the amer — for the
Americans immigration office to give us a visa to come here. That’s why I get so
upset when I see that they let so many people in without — without really knowing
anything about them. They x-rayed us, we went to Naples, we had to go through
some questions and well, the x-rayed showed — her x-rayed showed that she had a
tiny spot on her lungs. Every doctor, including Julian gave her a statement that

there’s absolutely nothing wrong with her lungs, they wouldn’t let her in here. So
she went to Israel. And she became a lawyer there in Haifa. We visited her when
we were there. And a— but why do I say that? In connection with what? I don’t
know. She passed away since then.
Q: Di— did your —
A: She used to write to me.
Q: Did your husband do any studies, any research on survivors? You had said that
he gave a paper on it — on them.
A: Oh — oh yes, he wrote the paper, yes.
Q: Did — did he do research on survivors?
A: Oh yes, oh yes.
Q: What kind of research?
A: He met with all kinds of people. I wasn't involved in that, he didn't involve me in
that. But he did meet with the people who survived the sp — from the psychiatric
point of view, what — what’s — where they had left anything. Well, of course,
everybody who survived that war has to be affected in some way or other. I mean,
you cannot be a normal person after surviving this. Like being hidden for 22 months
without being able to say a word loud, or — or sneeze or cough. How can you be
normal? I mean normal, depending what you mean by normal. But that’s very hard.

time?

more to my town.

Q: Why do you say now you would like to go back?

A: Absolutely. I read Polish books. I like the Pope because he is Polish. Julian left
quite a few Polish books, I didn’t realize when I was looking through the books. So I
started reading them. I didn't read them since I was 18 years old. Quite an
experience. At the beginning I thought [ll have a hard time, but 1t wasn’t working

that’s why I take care of her grandson.
Q: Do you receive any reparation money? Money for reparations?
A: No. No. I know people get it from Switzerland. First of all, I don’t know
whether my parents had any account. No, I don’t. I don’t need that money. I — I have
two granddaughters and I hope they will never know what it means to go through a
war. It’s devastating. I often think about it. But I had a good husband and he was —
he pulled me through it. I would have never survived without him. First of all, I
would have gone with my father, and second, I didn't know how to do it. He was —
he was the one who arranged everything for me, yeah. Strange. I never thought
when I was young that I will go through such a war. What makes one crazy man do
things? And they were — there were some very bright, intelligent people in his group
who followed him. That is the tragic thing. When I read the story of — what was the
name of his — his main — like here it, 1t was the — the forces, the — his for — he —
Rommel. He was a bright, intelligent man, but he was caught. He was caught. There
were more men like that. This is — this is tho — though it’s not an explanation why

conditions we were hidden. Very bright.

Q: Do — do you feel totally assimilated into American culture?
A: Yes and no. I am quite critical about the president, you know. And — but yes, I

in medical school, he fell in love with a very lovely Jewish girl. And I — I thought
they were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted — they were both 20 — he
insisted they get married. They got married, they had a little apartment near GW
where he was going to medical school. And I thought everything was beautiful until
about maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and
we did. And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart?

says no, you know, I love you, but I just don’t want to be married any more. And it
was a terrific blow to him, really bad. She was the one who got the divorce and as
far as I know, to this day she didn’t remarry. So then he met this girl, and she’s not
Jewish. And he married her, and seem like a good marriage. She works for the
World Bank. She’s a good mother. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but
who am I to say something? And he seems to be working out very nicely. He took
over the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he
directed now a play in the theater, he goes in his father’s footsteps. And he wants me
to move there. So I don’t know what life will bring, whatever it is. And I think it’s
