            "answer": "Yes. Ansbach was \u2014 had a very religious Jewish community. We had some famous rabbanim\u2019 there \u2014 Elie Munk for instance who wrote The World Of Prayer, wrote it there in Ansbach while I was his student, and I was very friendly with him. We always experienced some anti-Semitism in Bavaria \u2014 not outright \u2014 but we always felt we didn't belong to the whole town, so it was a strong and purposeful Jewish community that we had. And almost everybody was deeply religious. My father was the Jewish butcher in town, naturally kosher. There was nothing else. And we lived in a nice, heavy, solid stone house where we had lived for many years. My grandmother lived with us, my Aunt Adelheid, an unmarried aunt and there were two girls, myself and my sister Friedl. So 1t was a warm, extended, nice family."

We didn't even have any old age homes. There was a little separate apartment for my grandmother where she could do her own cooking if she wanted to, but I have never seen \u2014 I never remember that she did. She always ate and lived with us. And my Aunt Adelheid was \u2014 she had her own little business. She kept chickens and sold chickens, and I remember a lot how she took care of hens, and how she took us out with her into the yard and we could feel for the eggs, and that was always a lot of fun. It was a very primitive, solid, early 1900's kind of a context that I grew up on. ' Rabbis (Hebrew)  2"

It was a big house and you walked through and out into the yard, and there were the hens on one side and my father's sausage making machinery would be way down on the other side. And my mother's vegetable garden on this side over here. And our swing where my sister and I swang and played ball was on this corner here, and it was fun. We had very happy childhood until Hitler came when I was ten.:03:31"

Father used to get up at four in the morning to buy the cows that he needed for his butcher shop, and then he had to go to the next town to have them shekhted, the Jewish way of slaughtering the meat. And then he had to come back and he cut up that whole animal right in the backyard. I wasn't squeamish about it. And so he was always busy. And when he came home he was short tempered you know \u2014 the customers aggravated him. Mother always was even tempered and sweet and kind and pleasant."

At one time there was a phenomenon of a chicken running around with his head cut off already, the proverbial \u2014 he wasn't \u2014 somehow it didn't die right away and flattered or flipped around for a few minutes."

In fact, in all of Germany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all \u2014 you were very, very Reformed. Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet. So, yes, we were very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported. In other words we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms \u2014 on birth certificates, wedding forms or anything \u2014 our affiliation. It was always Jewish because the state paid for the upkeep of the synagogue. The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the Shohet. So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that and everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too.:06:01  3"

My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people. It didn't seem a problem. We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there was no danger for us to intermingle or anything. So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up to a certain point. But the real close friends were the Jewish people."

            "question": "And when you went to school, it was a mixed school?",
            "answer": "Yes. In grade school. I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the Lyzeum \u2014 that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college. That was already considered higher education. The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to the Gymnasium,\u201d which here is an athletic term, but over there 1t was an academic term. So, yes I do remember that very well. I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I could prove that my father was a World War I veteran. Already, Hitler had just come to power in January. I was admitted to school that fall. And I remember I had to bring some proof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise I could not have gone. I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student. So I did go, but I didn't stay very long. In 1936 there was a law that \u2014 it was phrased in that way \u2014 German students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish students. So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave. I always thought it was a very interesting way of framing it. In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more cautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on. But up to then we were accepted. We did not \u2014 slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore. I remember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph). How some names will stay with you all your life! And she and I were, little by little, we were ostracized. I remember us standing in the corner in the school yard. We couldn't mingle with the other kids anymore. And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be friendly to us. If they would, they were being punished. And I also remember that I was not allowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer. After a while I didn't even raise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me. As a Jewish student I was supposed to be stupid. I was supposed to be ignorant. I was not \u2014 Jews \u2014 Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers? And that hurt a while but then I got use to it. But finally in \u201836 we had to leave. And I got as far as fourth grade in there instead of the ordinary sixth grade. I didn't graduate. And that hurt because I didn't know what else to do. I couldn't stay at home \u2014 and I couldn't go to any other school, so that the childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not. And my sister who was a year ahead of me \u2014 same story. She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was even more ostracized and picked upon \u2014 and she was more timid than I was. I was always more the \u201ctomboy\u201d type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was. So * High school (German)  4 she suffered actually more than I did. And when we came home we talked a little about it, but then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family.:10:45"

            "question": "Did your parents give you any advice about what to do when you came home and talked about this kind of abuse?",
            "answer": "Did my parents give me any advice? I would say \u201cno.\u201d My parents already were wrapped up in their own problems. Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbot\u2019 came \u2014 and I think what you mean by that. The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals 1n the ritualistic way by shekhting. And I always thought that was such an irony. The reason Hitler gave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals. Think about that for a minute. For the animals he had pity, but for us \u2014 he put us into the gas. There was no more inhumanity involved there. So in \u201838, being very considerate for those poor animals, there was the Schechtverbot. And then Father had his own problems. I remember how Father and Mother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out what the future will bring. Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see. For a while there was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936. It was unheard of. Nobody would touch it \u2014 and so he gave that up very quickly. And then there was no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens. And they were having problems. For a long time I remember Father saying, \u201cMir gehen mit dem letzten Zug.\" That was Bayerisch\u201d \u2014 that was Bavarian dialect for \"We're going to go with the last train. We're going to stick it out. We're not gonna leave here.\" But after a while he had to realize that there was no \"letzten Zug.\" There was not gonna be a last train. So they had their own problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems. They couldn't have helped us anyway. If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother. They seemed to \u2014 they were very close to us. Does that give you a little picture of my home life? It was a nice, close, lovely family. And then came 1938 \u2014 Kristallnacht\u00ae. For a while the non Jews were moderate in their intercourse with us. They held back, but they weren't hostile. And I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at night when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit because already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to. All of a sudden that was \u2014 the Jews couldn't really buy what they wanted.:13:37"

            "answer": "Well, little by little the merchants would become hostile to us. And when they saw us coming the better things would disappear under the counter, like the better fruits. I remember there were always Blut Orangen\u2019 from America \u2014 that was those red oranges from America which was \u2014 that was just a delicacy for us. I remember that so much. Mother used to bring that home once in a while. But then as time went on, there were no more Blut Orangen. They disappeared the minute they saw us coming. And so, little by little, there was hostility. And dearth by us, after a little while, and we became poor. I remember how we used to sit around that Blaupunkt radio that we had. I can still remember that so well. You used to turn the knob and the whole dial would zoom back and forth. You didn't have to turn the knob little by little. You just touched it a little and the dial would fly away from you and you had to catch it to where you wanted it. But no matter which station you took, there was always Hitler's voice on the radio \u2014 always this frightening voice \u2014 this loud, hypnotizing speech that he gave \u2014 always against the Jews and how he would make the life of the Germans better and better if they would just follow him and do away with the Jews \u2014 and the Jews had taken all their good things \u2014 and the whole Versailles Treaty was the fault of the Jews. The huge banners that came up over Ansbach that used to say, \u201cDie Juden sind unser Ungliick*\u201d \u2014\"The Jews are our misfortune. Everything bad that happened to the Germans is the fault of the Jews.\" And my sister and I used to slink by those huge banners that were all over the city and we used to try just not to see them, thinking if we didn't see them, they weren't there. But they were there. Little by little that really took over. And I remember the torch parades that came. Hitler visited Ansbach many times actually. It was a stronghold for the SA, the earlier group as you know. First came the SA and then came the SS The SA was the Sturmabteilung\u201d and then the SS was the Schutzstaffeln\u2019\u201d. They actually \u2014 it started out as a personal body guard of Hitler, but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the dominant military and civil force in Germany. But I remember still the SA going down our cobblestone streets with their large torches and singing and marching. And these were all young kids that we still knew at one time before they became SA It was always frightening. And when Hitler came into town the Jews, of course, were ordered to stay away \u2014 stay off the streets. And also an interesting thing was, in the Nuremberg Laws what we thought was the least ominous law was, that the Jews could not fly the German flag. That, you know, we thought that we could live with. Well, who wants it to fly the German flag? But it turned out that was also a seminal law. Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because everybody else had to fly the flag. So that was also an interesting law. That was up to Kristallnacht. After that 1t was no problem anyway.:18:14"

            "answer": "No, except the kids used to \u2014 after a while they threw stones at us, or they made snowballs with a stone inside you know and hit it at us, and we didn't know. And that was, of course, like a missile. And we couldn't retaliate. We couldn't throw a snowball back. Number one, we were much too timid, and number two, they would have just killed us if we had. They were already \u2014 now the Hitlerjungend.\u2019' Both the boys and the girls had to be in the Hitlerjungend, the youth organization of the SS, and they were all powerful. When they had their little Hitleryungend\u2019s uniforms on, they felt like they were God themselves. Otherwise, back to your question, no, I have not seen anyone being beaten up. But I will tell you, we didn't provoke them. We stayed in our houses and we slunk around the streets and if we saw anyone\u2014"

            "question": "Mrs. Haas, can you go back to this time and talk a little bit about the intimidation that you were feeling. You said that you would walk sort of in a frightened way and would stay in your house. What was this doing to you and your sister?",
            "answer": "Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a half older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and \u2014 they called it \" Untermensch,'\u201c\" \u201csubhuman\u201d \u2014 and you personally are responsible for everything that's going wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any way. You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances come up and speak for yourself \u2014 for itself, after a while that does something to you. After a while \u2014 after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid. You believe you look Jewish and you look ugly and you are not worthy of anything. And it really took a while to get over this. And you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing and it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet. They still feel that they are the less human \u2014 the lesser human race \u2014 and I still \u2014 they look depressed to me. I think I got over it, but during the time I believed I was no good. I believed I was a second rate human being. It was a terrible thing to do. And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids that went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden, broken home, they had no clothes to wear, they \u2014 in many cases they had to come to the Jewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi uniforms and their \u2014 first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid. They were beautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they were still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people. But all of a sudden they were shining, they were beautiful. And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you psychologically. These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the uniform. They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great. And they did. They got away with it. ' Hitler youth (German) '* Sub-human (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial theory.  7:22:14 As you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany was the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would stand above the law \u2014 could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on the street. As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them. Now if you think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos,\u2019\u201d stateless. That means we had no recourse to the law. Any injustice that was done to us, forget it. There was no law to go to, to complain. But they \u2014 and the psychological effect of that is not to be underestimated. They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable. No law could touch them. And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we were, they were told how great they were \u2014 and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met them again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had. I don't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person. It suddenly makes him into a semi-god. And Hitler was no dummy about that. His uniforms were beautiful, shiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things. And then the names, they all of a sudden were \u2014 they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore \u2014 they were Oberscharfiihrer'* and they were Blockleiter.'\u201d And the kids already they were \u2014 I can't remember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title. They were somebody. And they had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but that's \u2014 but you don't know that when you're stuck in it. You only know that 50 years later when you acquire a little overview and a little insight. But that was part of the success of the Nazis \u2014 those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades. That was uplifting to them and to the spectators \u2014 to the people who watched. They suddenly belonged.:24:24"

I still remember so well when they sat around the table at night and worried, and worried, \u201cWhat are we going to do? What are we going to do with the kids?\u201d We couldn't go to school anymore. \u201cHow are we gonna live?\u201d Anger was far away. Worry and fear was the dominant emotions. And then the belief in God, that never left us. \u201cGod will help. God will bring resolution. Hitler won't last long. Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by Christmas. Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by spring. No, he wasn't.\u201d We believed our own wishes.

It went in one ear and out the other for us. What does he mean \u201cJudenrein\u201d? This is not a word we grew up with. So we ignored it. But he knew what he meant and he did it too. Now I get angry when I think about it, but in those days, no, there was no anger. There was only great, great fear. And then we gathered around our Rabbi and he told us... Everybody was so short-sighted. Everybody was so blind. Even the Rabbi, whom we thought had real insight and foresight and a direct line to God you know, he said, \"Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Don't leave Ansbach. Stay, stay, stay.\" But unfortunately, then he was the first to leave. He went and got a job in Paris as a Rabbi and he left. And that opened our eyes after that. We too began to leave. That hurt me more than anything else \u2014 that our Rabbi left us our beloved Rabbi. It's like your father leaving you. That was interesting in retrospect."

And I'm not only speaking of my sister and myself. But that whole youth group whose picture you have seen. We gathered around him every Shabbos and we were devoted to him. That great  9 faith, I think, helped me a great deal, because later on when things really got... What I'm telling you now, that's not bad. That's just the beginning. But later on when things really got bad, then there was nothing else to cling to. And I wonder if people understand that, that you can still be religious and believe in God even though you see what \u2014 let's say, what God is doing all around you. I don't want to have to explain what I just said. But on the one hand you see all the evil that \u2014 in our religious mind was still sent from God. And on the other hand, you come inward and you still believed he would help \u2014 and that was a big help. It really was. It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help. And then later on when I was rescued, and I found my father again. Then again also my mother and my whole family had died. Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and had saved my father. And then I married a religious man. I tried to bring up my children religious. And it's a problem. You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of all you can't live without it. So it's a way of life now. It's a way of life.:31:22"

            "question": "When you got kicked out of Lyzeum, when you couldn't go anymore \u2014 when the Jewish children couldn't go \u2014 what was the decision of your parents?",
            "answer": "Yes. I remember that very well also. My sister was already old enough. First of all she had graduated. She was two years ahead of me. She had graduated from the Lyzeum and now she \u2014 there was nothing else to do. There was no post-graduate or college or anything \u2014 forget it. She could either go to Hakhshara'\u2019 to prepare herself for Israel \u2014 for Palestine, but remember we were going with the last train so there was no need to go to Palestine. We weren't leaving Ansbach. So she went to a girls Landwirtschaftschule\u2019* \u2014 a girls preparation for... just to be a wife and a mother. It wasn't Landwirtschaftschule, it was Wolfratshausen. How can I explain it to you? It was a preparatory school for young women \u2014 for young ladies. I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so that they would look like military in the shelves. You know, that's the kind of thing they learned. Much good that did us. And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish school that was still in existence. That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin. Now Berlin was far from Ansbach. It was like 300 kilometers and that was far. Remember, we're in30s in Europe. We're not in the 1990s in America. Berlin was far and I didn't know anybody. I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids. And now the bigger problem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school. I had only gone to my Rabbi during the section that was called \u201creligion,\u201d \u2014 \u201creligion,\u201d when the Catholics went to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went to Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk. And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a week where we had religion. So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly. So that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I '\u2019 Hakhshara He-Halutz [Pioneer Training] (Hebrew) Agricultural school (German) \u201d Religion (German)  10 couldn't excel, you see. So it was tough. And then I was called home after Kristallnacht. I remember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on the streets and the people huddled and depressed. And it was very obvious that what had impacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews. They walked around like the victims \u2014 like the hunted. And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and there my family had been taken to a collection center. Father had been sent to prison along with all the men. And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were packing. And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave everything. And I remember the name of the man that was just \u2014 just a very simple little fellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house. And he already had moved in with his eight kids. And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station, and then we realized really what was going on. Then Father didn't talk about the last train anymore. And, then we went \u2014 we could only go to certain cities. We couldn't just pick up and leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment \u2014 far from it. We were told which cities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone to live with. And we found a distant relative \u2014 well it doesn't matter \u2014 there was some relationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had. And then Father and all the uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn. The Munich Jews had been sent to Dachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg. And I remember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and then we began to wake up. Then we still only thought that the men were in danger. Who could think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected business people or anything? So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the British Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to Sandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope \u2014 this was in July of 1939. There was no talk of war, yet. Hitler kept that very secret. It was \u2014 that was like a bombshell when the war started. So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in Poland, there was no fear of war. So we thought that my father could find domestic positions for us and bring us over after him. But the war ended that."

You didn't leave your family. You didn't separate. You didn't leave your family alone. So that was very traumatic when my father left in that train in the railroad station in Munich. And my mother  11 who was a typical Orthodox Jewish woman with a shaytel\u201d\u201d on and completely helpless. Everything she did \u2014 she ever did, she was told by her husband. People were like that. I know it sounds medieval, but they were married off as youngsters, completely natve and then they were told, \"Your husband will tell you what to do.\" And my father always told her what to do. And all of a sudden she was alone. And I remember how devastated she was and how helpless at first. But then she had to learn. The money \u2014 the little bit of money that she received from the house was put into an account and she was only allowed a little sum every month. And she had to go and humiliate herself and beg for that \u2014 her own money \u2014 to get a little money so she could live another month. And then she sent us away. She sent my sister to Frankfurt, to the Jewish hospital. It was called Gagernstrasse. And I was a little too young to be a nurse. I was just old enough to be a baby nurse. And there's a division we don't have in this country, but I became a baby nurse. I was barely seventeen, and I was to Berlin.:39:49"

            "answer": "I remember the train station very vividly. I'm sure he talked with my mother, but the talk was not \u2014 not morbid. The goodbye was not like a final thing \u2014 like a finite goodbye. It was, \"I'll do all I can to get you positions.\" And the British helped. The British Jews helped. And it worked for many people in that transport. Later on in New York I met many comrades of my father's who had gone with him into the transport and they were able to bring their wives and children, and mothers and fathers over to England still. But somehow it just didn't work for my father. After he died I found his notebook that he wrote. Every day he went and tried to find a family who would take us in. Of course he didn't speak English.

And so we left, and again it was \u2014 it was not a big goodbye. But as soon as I was in Berlin, then we had to wear the star. Then there was a law that we couldn't travel. Then there was a law we couldn't use telephones \u2014 public telephone stations. So all of a sudden we were completely cut off from her. No way of going back and no way of talking with her \u2014 just letters, letters, letters, letters. And she \u2014 the letters that she wrote to my father, she always tried to include letters from us. And my father gave me that whole bunch of letters. I still *\u201d Wig (Yiddish)  12 have it at home. First she writes \u2014 and she writes always the same \u2014 \"How am I going to get out of here? What's my quota? Who is going to help me?

And then the one ray of sunshine, \"And I include a letter from the children.\" So she always waited until she got mail from us, from my sister in Frankfurt and from me. And we wrote, more or less normal \u2014 how we enjoyed our training \u2014 especially I, I worked with children, you see. And my sister, how she liked being trained as a nurse and how interesting 1t was, and how she made friends. This was a new life for her. All of a sudden my sister had friends, and she could shine, and she was a great nurse. And she sent back a picture in her uniform. Now she too had a uniform. That was really something.

The ships\u2019 places were very rare, and the quota was coveted \u2014 to be on the quota was heaven \u2014 to finally reach the quota. So the people who were lucky like that kept that very secret \u2014 very much to themselves. They didn't say. And then all of a sudden, this family left. I met them again years later in New York and that was a big blow to us. And we stuffed \u2014 they finally allowed us to put a few things into their lift \u2014 into their package \u2014 and that's how we saved a very few of our treasured things that weren't so valuable, but they were very much treasured by us. And when I met them again in New York, of course I was also... In a way we were very grateful for them. They had taken us in. But in another way we felt very hurt that they snuck out. So that apartment was confiscated by the Nazis and we had to find another Jewish family. Now it got much more difficult already. So there was this Frau Frankel(ph) who took us in, who had \u2014 her husband was still alive. And I met them later in Theresienstadt again. She and my mother then became friends.

But we didn't know from deportation at that point. The word was unknown to us \u201cDeportation\u201d did that mean? And the other word \u2014 the other term that was used was \u201cArbeitstransport.\u201d Those were all \u2014 there was a whole new terminology coming up that meant very little to us. \u201cJudenrein,\u201d \u201cJudenfrage,~\u201d \u201cLosung der Judenfrage.~\u201d You know, there were \u201cOsttransport.\u201d\u2019\u201d What did that mean? So \u201cDeportation\u201d was not a word that was heard of when I left my mother. I thought she would stay there. Now, by then, \u2014 no, not yet. A little later Father got to America. And then \u2014 yes, Father already had gotten to America in \u201839. He was shipped out very quickly. And that was \u2014 now we're talking about 1940. Mother is alone and the letters that she writes to Father, *! Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their Jewish population. ** Jewish question (German) *\u00b0 Answer to the Jewish question (German) * East transport (German) \u00b0\u00b0 Deportation (German)  14 which Father gave me later on so I'm very much in the picture what was happening through those letters. Now she goes to the immigration station daily, daily, daily. That was her daily work \u2014 to see if she could get out. And he in America was begging for money to buy the visa and to buy the ship's cards for the three of us. And still there was this thinking that the three of us would stay together. And then in one letter, that's like an \u2014 that's like an, like an epiphany already. In one letter she writes, and that was already very late when it was already much too late \u2014 she writes, \"Siegfried, don't try to get the three of us out. Just get the children out. Forget about me,\" she says. So then she volunteered a little bit in an old age home. And then in 1941, when she was 45 years old, she got into Transport. By then I was in Berlin at the Jewish hospital. And then my sister also ended up in Berlin because the Gagernstrasse was Closed. And for a short while we were together. And even when she goes into the transport, the last letter to my father she says, \"Don't worry about me. I'll be okay. Everybody else is going too. And I'm packing all my warm clothes. And I'll see you when all this 1s over.\" Now we can talk about Berlin.:51:41"

She had to go to a public \u2014 she had to go to the Jewish Community to use the phone. She was not allowed into a public phone. So she could call us in the Jewish hospital. We still had a phone. And then we had to call her back, pre-arranged, that she'd be at the Jewish Community in Munich. And she \u2014 first we tried to go with her. And number one, we couldn't get onto a train, we already wore the star. And, and number two, she said, \"Don't go with me.\" She says, \u201cThere's no use. I'll work, and what's the use?\" And then somehow she knew that the transport was going to Riga. That was on the 1 1th of November \u2014 on the ninth of November, 1941. It was one of the very first transports out of Germany. That was before, that was before the Wannsee Conference, when the killing was not really automatic yet. And still, in Riga, as I later found out, they were killed as soon as they got there. But still we hoped that we would see each other again. We had no idea that they were killed right away. When I got to Theresienstadt, I was so happy. I thought I would find my mother. I would find people again.

And the * Camp system (German)  15 remaining people all came to Berlin to work Zwangsarbeit,\u201d\u2019 forced labor at the Siemens factory. To this day I can't buy anything from Siemens, believe me. So my sister was one of them. And later on that whole group went to Auschwitz. But for a short while we were together and we could see each other on our days off. We couldn't use the U-Bahn* or the City Bahn~ transportation or anything. We had to walk. We had to walk with our star. And one of the thousands of laws that concerned us, that are really not well known, was that Jews could not walk in any greenery, in any park, in anything that was planted and was pretty. That was for Aryans only. So where there was a park \u2014 the Tiergarten\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and no matter what we had to walk around it. We couldn't go through it. So I remember walking and walking and walking to visit her and then walking back. And we had to be home at a certain hour, so it was very restricted. The Berlin years were difficult years. The Ansbach years were mostly happy, and the Munich years were ignorance. Dominant emotion was naivet\u00e9. What was going on we had no idea and still a lot of hope. But Berlin and our eyes were opened and all the many laws that we had to respect that Hitler made. The whole, the whole Losung der Judenfrage \u2014 the whole deportation of the Jews was done legally. That's the ironic part. First he made a law, then he killed us. You see? But how did we know that? We knew the law and we tried to live with it. Then we already were, were very much the victims. We looked very bad. We had no more \u2014 we couldn't get clothing coupons. I remember we couldn't get coupons to have our shoes repaired. So we walked around in shoes that were ready to be thrown out. We couldn't get new ones. That's without even saying. But we couldn't get our old ones repaired either. So we had no clothes. We had bad shoes. We were not well nourished. We had the star. We didn't need the star. We marked as victims from the inside out, and from the outside as well. Where as they got better and better \u2014 well fed and more victorious, and more triumphant every day.:57:03 In the hospital, first I was in Niedershonhausen and then that was dissolved, and then I went in Berlin. I'm telling you how bad everything was, and yet there was that little nucleus of happiness still, you know. We were among Jews. We could talk with them. We had our own little kingdom. We had our own little hierarchy. I was just a student nurse. I was nobody, but the hierarchy went to the Head Nurse, and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly with you, which was not the case in my case. I never got enough self-confidence up to talk to a head nurse, and she wasn't that much older than I was. And then, of course, there was the whole hierarchy \u2014 all the physicians that seemed like demigods. And then there was the whole god; that was Lustig \u2014 Dr. Lustig \u2014 Dr. Walter Lustig. He had two Doctors. He called himself Doctor Doctor Walter Lustig. He was a very prominent Jew before the Nazis came. He was married to an Aryan woman \u2014 to an Aryan physician woman and that was why he was saved for quite a while. I'll get back to Lustig in a minute, but as you know the Mischlin *\u2019 Forced labor (German) Untergrund Bahn [Underground train] (German); Subway. \u201d Train (German) *\u00b0 Zoological garden (German)  16 \u2014 the Mischehe\u201d' and the Mischlinge\u201d were a big problem to Hitler, and in fact the hospital remained in existence because of that problem of the Mischlinge and the Mischehe. They couldn't divorce. The Pope didn't allow that, and Hitler couldn't treat the Aryan person as a Jew, and he couldn't really accept the Jew as an Aryan, so he tolerated them. And it was always a.... I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the Mischlinge. That was obviously a thorn in his side. And the children of those Mischlinge were also a big problem. And Theresienstadt was partly organized for those Mischlinge. They couldn't very well go into their death. After all, in many cases they had a pure Aryan father or... who was fighting for Hitler on the front. So anyway, Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as leader of the Jewish hospital."

Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what have you. So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there. So the Oberschwester, > the Head Nurse of Niedershonhausen \u2014 as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her name \u2014 invited my sister. So my sister walked. And I remember the Head Nurse then instructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg. Now that \u2014 need I say more? In40, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin. I remember how much that meant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down. They didn't have good food and they worked very hard. They did factory work. I don't exactly know what they did. She never talked about it. But in one of the letters to my mother \u2014 and then she sent it to my father \u2014 she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse \u2014 that she's taking care of the little injuries, etc., etc., and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was very proud of it also. And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't recall too much about that. I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and they had left. There was this empty big room with nothing there. There was one hat that I remember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back home. I don't recall my emotions or anything. I probably blocked them out and, again, the hope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported. That was always the one \u201cglimmer\u201d of the deportation. We always thought we would see each other again. We would also get there \u2014 like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was not the way it worked \u2014 was the concentration camps.:04:35"

Her rations \u2014 she worked hard and I think her rations were minimal because I remember so clearly how she enjoyed that egg. So she must have had very poor food. And I don't remember too much. I remember that we wrote to my father a lot when we got together and I don't, I don't remember what we wrote, but I know what we wrote from reading the letters 30 years later and she writes \u2014 I remember especially in one letter she writes, \u201cKann denn niemand etwas fir uns tun?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cCan't anybody do anything for us?\" We had, after all by then, the major part of our family here and one part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help us at all. And I've never quite forgiven them that. They could have helped us. They had the money and we could have gone into Argentina. The quota wasn't that strict. And I remember especially from her letter, \u201cKann dem Tante Lina garnichts ftir uns tun??? \u2014 \u201cCan't Aunt Lina\" \u2014 who was the one there \u2014 \"do anything for us.\" So she was much more realistic than I was. I didn't write such things. I only wrote about my nursing and my friends that I made and how much I liked it, and things like that. She was much more with the times than I was. And Aunt Lina unfortunately did nothing either. That was very, very sad that my own family didn't gather around and pulled out as much as, as many as they could.:07:13"

            "question": "Why do you think in the Jewish Community Hospital that you were working in, that the food was simply available and you were getting a better diet?",
            "answer": "Well I think it was simply because they were a big institution and \u2014 I don't know. I never wondered. It never occurred to me to wonder. But we actually still had kosher food. That was the amazing part. That whole business with the Jewish hospital 1s very intriguing indeed, and I'm doing some research on it now. Up to my deportation in *43, there was a kosher kitchen in the Jewish hospital, which is phenomenal. And there were a few people, one of the housekeepers, a couple of the physicians and several of the nurses, who trotted there every meal time and got their kosher meals served, so how? I don't know where they got it from. And why the Jewish hospital remained in existence and was \u2014 never even the name changed, Das Jiidische Krankenhaus\u201d\u201d it was called \u2014 and on Iranische Strasse\u2019\u2019 number two \u2014and it's still there. You can still go there and see the same building \u2014 rebuilt. It was bombed out after I left. And now I haven't done the research yet, so whatever my opinions are at the moment are my own speculations. I think, number one, Lustig, Dr. Lustig was very much in with the Nazi supervision of the hospital. He was as much of a puppet as anybody else of course. And I am still friendly with one of the nurses now that was there, and she was * Can\u2019t anyone do anything for us? (German) * Can Aunt Lina do nothing for us? (German) \u00b0\u00b0 The Jewish Hospital (German) *\u2019 Street (German)  19 friendly with him. And she tells of the story which I totally believe, which is completely within the context of what I remembered. She says many times she would be with him and he would answer the telephone with, \"Hello. Dr. Lustig,\" and he would immediately put it down again. Then the phone would ring again and he would say, \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d You see. They didn't accept if he just... If they were calling him, they didn't want just \u201cDr. Lustig.\u201d They wanted \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d So he was a puppet. There's no question about it. Within the Jews he was all powerful naturally. He was the one that made up the lists. He was the one that put cross checks on who should go into transports of nurses, doctors, personnel, patients. He was the all powerful one. But within the context of the Nazis, he was a puppet. He was nothing. He did their doing. And if he didn't, he was the one that was punished. So, it's hard to know how to judge him. I'm tempted to judge him benevolently. Many people hated him. Many people feared him. He \u2014 of course, you know he was such a powerful man, stories build up. And I remember so well, when we first came to the hospital, we were in Niedershonhausen, student \u2014 we were 17, 18 years old. And again I have to caution you to realize what that meant back in the 30s and in Berlin we were so, so simple, so naive. And then when we were transferred to the big hospital, the rumor went that, \"Dr. Lustig will inspect all the student nurses completely naked. And only the ones that he likes naked he would take in.\" Of course it was a stupid rumor, and it did not occur at all, but that was his, his aura. That was his reputation. He was all powerful. He could demand anything he wanted and we had to do it. But 1t wasn't so. He was just a very nice man. He was very powerful, yes, but also quite nice.:11:37"

And the general rule was to try to be very friendly with his girlfriends And I never managed that. And I always felt very ostracized and very badly. We lived in the nursing home and we nurses, of course, chummed together. And you have to realize I am still friendly with some of these people. My best friend \u2014 my best girlfriend whom I liked so much then, and whom I still like so much now. We're both in our 70s, but we're still like kids together \u2014 and again, an example of how naive we were. She and I roomed together in Niedershonhausen, and we were working hard. We had seven to seven shifts \u2014 seven in the morning to seven at night, or vice versa. And then after the shift we had to do our theoretical work, and we were tired. So we went into bed with each other, studied for a while, and then fell asleep just to save time. And we still chuckle over that, you know. We tell it to our husbands. And in the morning, we were woken up by the night nurses because we didn't wake up by ourselves at all \u2014 forget 1t \u2014 and they found us in bed together. Well, we were called before the, the Leiter\u201d \u2014 I think back to German, to the German things \u2014 I sometimes *> The Jew Lustig, here. (German) *\u201d The Jew Lustig, here. (German) * Director (German)  20 miss my English \u2014 to the administrator of the Niedershonhausen Institution, and he scolded us, you know. But we didn't know why. We didn't know what we had done wrong. He thought we were fooling around together. That was the furthest thing from our minds. This just to show you how very naive we were. So here was that rumor we had to be undressed and we were fearful like anything, but it didn't happen. So then the next thing was we had to be friendly with the girlfriends of Lustig. And somehow she managed it and I didn't. And then we got together in the evening in our nursing dormitories and she would tell me everything \u2014 whatever was going on. They joked and they made friends and they laughed and they talked about the patients and the doctors. And I felt terrible. I never was included. And now I'm not so sorry anymore because this particular Head Nurse was not a very fine person. She then fraternized with the SS, and I'm not a bit sorry that I was not one of her friends. The SS man at the Jewish hospital was Dobberke(ph) \u2014 SS man Dobberke, and he was feared. He walked around and he would send us into transport on his own without going through Lustig. If the star wasn't sewed on nicely, or if he could smell cigarettes on our breath, or if we didn't stand up and greet him properly, or for any old reason, he would take us into transport. And I heard later on, after I left, that this particular Head Nurse from the \u2014 from the Kinderstation*' \u2014 her nurse's name was Elly(ph), Schwester Elly, she then became his girlfriend.

And then the doctors would come in and we had to report on the kids. It wasn't so sophisticated. Don't think we knew all that much. And then at noontime we had, I don't recall \u2014 I guess we went back to the Speisesaal for lunch, and then the inner circle always went into Schwester Elly's little room and smoked cigarettes with the doors closed.

So everything that we did, we did within the hospital. And the hospital was a complex \u2014 a whole compound.

The SS never spoke to anyone else, you see. He was their man. So Lustig let it be known throughout the hospital \u2014 that was in October of \u201842, that \u2014 up to then it was sort of, you know, it was sort of dispersed.

It got bunched up together \u2014 that we were all going to be Wo oe Order (German)  25 appearing the next morning at seven o'clock in full uniforms at the Jewish Community Center on Oranien Strasse . And that was a big room. We got there of course. There was no way we would not go there. It didn't occur to us not to go. That's another thing. We were so conditioned to obey. If I look at those kids nowadays, they refuse to obey their mothers, or their teachers, or their governors, or their President... It was the furthest thing from our minds not to obey an order, you see. And when I speak to students, I always encourage them to continue doing that. So we obeyed. We went in our uniform with our star, seven o'clock in the morning, the whole bunch of us, and it was a big room, and we just stood there. We didn't know why. We had no idea why we were called. Lustig didn't tell us and nobody else knew. And we stood and we stood, and it was, we couldn't go to the toilet, we couldn't get any coffee, and I'm quickly reaching for my nice cup of tea so it won't be taken away from me. We were desperate. At 12 o'clock, three SS men showed up. We knew Eichmann. He was very familiar to us. We also knew Giinther.\u201d\u2019 He was also familiar. There were two SS Gunthers \u2014 one from Berlin and one from Prague. This was Gunther from Berlin. And then there were three Jews from Vienna. And then there was an SS man whom we didn't know. And of course we couldn't whisper among each other, \"Who was that? What's going on?\" That was completely out. And at first they didn't talk to us at all. They just stood there in front of us and smoked and laughed and joked. Very young, our age. I was 20 at that point. And then they called before them the heads of each of the Jewish departments \u2014 of each department, including Lustig who was head of the hospital.:32:44 And then, then first of all, that guy introduced himself. He was Brunner \u2014 Anton Brunner\u201d! from Vienna. And he had come from Vienna with those three Jews. Then he told us why he was there, and in his own Viennese dialect, which is still ringing in my ears he said, and of course I'll say it in English, that he came to show the SS in Berlin how to deal with the Jews \u2014 how they had dealt with the Jews in Vienna. And that's why he came and brought the three Jews with him. How to deal with the Jews? We thought they had been doing fine up to now. But his innovation was \u2014 his fork in the road \u2014 was that from now on the Jews had to do the dirty work. And he demonstrated it right away. He told the leaders of each department to pick their own, to pick their own \u2014 30 percent of each department to go into transport. He wasn't gonna bother picking anymore. He had each of the Jews pick their own Jews. And that didn't sink in right away, but after it sank in it was really ein Wendepunkt\u201d \u2014 a turning point \u2014 a pivotal point in the history of the Holocaust. From then on it was Jews stuffing Jews into the, into the cattle cars. It was Jews taking the Jews out of the cattle cars, too, and doing all the, all the agents of their own destruction they were from then on. And under that falls the Kapos\u201d\u201d and the Jewish elders, and even we, we got white armbands. We had to go \u201d Rolf Giinther *' Alois (Anton) Brunner ** Turning point, milestone (German) *\u00b0 Formen (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor squadron of prisoners.  26 around helping them and we had to do our own.

And he said that if not everybody would show up, those 20 people would be killed. At the time I still remembered their names and I think I wrote it into my, into my notes. I could look it up. But it\u2019s not important at the moment. And some actually did either kill themselves \u2014 some of the people who were supposed to go to transport either killed themselves or went underground, or just ran away. And he actually did kill those 20 people. He sent the ashes to their families. So we knew he meant business. And that was the same thing later in Theresienstadt. If something went wrong \u2014 20, 200, 2,000 \u2014 were killed for one person. So that's the reason why I didn't \u2014 why we didn't think of, of objecting, of doing anything against them. We couldn't be responsible for the death of our own people. But anyway, so then we were sent back, and the second time we were sent back, he called the head of the Jewish Community before him \u2014 that was Dr. Kraindl \u2014 and Kraindl was struck by a heart attack in front of these SS people and fell dead. And he said, \"Move him. Go away. Take away that dead person. Just another dead Jew.\" And then the third time we were told to go the Kasernen\u201d\u2019 \u2014 to the barracks to help with the transportation of the Jews.:37:11 Now that was in February of \u201843 during the big Fabrikaktion.\u201d\u00b0 The Fabrikaktion was that they went into the \u2014 into those factories and took out the people who were working there who thought they were protected \u2014 who had been promised protection because they worked for the \u2014 for the military units. And they came by the thousands. They came in huge furniture vans stuffed with Jews, just they way they were from the factories \u2014 in their aprons \u2014 with their clothes \u2014 and always with the star of course. And we had to take care of them. We had... One of my friends, her name was Klara, I remember it. We were assigned to the Rathenower Kaserne in Berlin. I had never been there. We had to go there by special permit to use the public transportation. And there was this huge barrack, and the Jews were not allowed to use the toilets. That was the first thing. No food of course \u2014 no toilets \u2014 nothing. So then some Jewish people came who dug a ditch in the backyard. That was the toilet. And then finally some coffee came. But in between that we already had some thousands of Jews who were ~* Barracks (German) \u00bb\u00b0 Factory action (German); factory round-up.  27 beside themselves \u2014 direct from the factory \u2014 without their mothers or fathers or children or husbands, or anybody. That was really pandemonium in that \u2014 1n those barracks. Then I remember we had to go out and take in all these people that came by the hundreds. And I remember one van opened up and blood stained people fell out. They had resisted and the SS shot them. Big deal, you know. And we weren't allowed to do anything to them \u2014 we just... We had no material anyway. So they were then shipped off too, the way they were \u2014 bleeding. And then we were... We worked there for two days straight \u2014 for three days straight, and then finally we were released from duty and some other nurses came with their white armbands and we got back. And then we went again the next three days. It was three day shifts. And then finally that Fabrikaktion was over \u2018cause there were no more Jews to take. That was in February, \u201843, and then a few weeks later I was finally taken too. I had enough by then. Now you can understand why I say it was a relief.:41:24"

It was a military barrack. And we were in the big, big room, and we had to bring them in from the vans, and take them to a place, and say, \"Now this is your place. You stay here until we come back to you and tell you what to do.\" They had nothing with them. They came directly from work. And we didn't know very much either, so we did the best we could. We had no food to give them for a long while. What happened was they, they begged us to see that their children would be taken care of, or their old mothers would be taken care of. But how could we do that? We couldn't leave the barracks either. So they scribbled on little notepads where to go to. But if the SS saw that they would shoot right away. So we quickly stuck them into our pockets, and afterwards we drove around and tried to help as much as we could. It was nothing that you can normally foresee. This \u2014 these Fabrikaktion involved 20,000 people that were shipped out of Berlin during those three days."

In many cases they thought they would deal much more kindly with the Jews than the Nazis would, and they could ease our suffering in some ways.

Enjoyment was measured in decimals \u2014 not in going to the Opera. No, this was fun. I was going to be together with Eva and Werner for a few hours \u2014 a few days. And I don't remember too much otherwise about the journey, just that we got there and we had to walk then from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt. And then the children were already taken care of. Somebody took the whole group of children, and we were on our own. Then we turned and helped the older people. Don't forget there were also old patients out of the hospital, and people who couldn't walk. And then Eva and I helped the older people. And she had her little boy with her anyway who was \u2014 see he was born in \u201841. He was two years old. He was a little kid. And then I remember getting into Theresienstadt, and it looked all very, very foreign \u2014 very different. It was a fortress. It was a, it was a medieval fortress \u2014 an enclosure with a moat, and you had go over a bridge to get in, and you didn't see very much because there were these high walls. All I could see was the church steeple. And around, there was this huge walls. And once we were inside we could tell that along the walls, all around the ghetto in an octagon, were these barracks \u2014 these huge stone buildings, two stories high \u2014 and they were again closed up toward the street, you see. You had to go into the barracks just like you had to go into Theresienstadt to see what was inside. You had to again go into the barracks, and then you ended up like in a huge courtyard, and around you again was barracks. Can you follow this? And you could \u2014 perhaps I can, I can compare it to a monastery where you can walk all around and you still, you're still inside. You're still \u2014 always facing that huge exercise grounds. It was a military barracks where the people had to do their military exercises, you see, and you could almost watch that from every point. And we were sent into the upstairs rooms, and we were laid on straws. That was all we had. And that was our Ubikation\u2122 it was called \u2014 unsere Wohnung\u201d \u2014 our residence \u201c Rooming space (German) \u00b0\u00b0 Our domicile (German)  33 for the moment.:59:05 End of Tape #2  34 Tape #3:01:06"

And then it took several hours. Then we had to sit on our knapsacks for a while in the barrack grounds until  36 that whole transport was absorbed and registered in and that took awhile.

And then we had to go into Hundertschaft.\u201d\u201d Literally translated that means detail of a hundred. And it was always a hundred people that worked at a certain task. I was in the Hundertschaft of cleaning \u2014 sweeping the streets at first. You didn't get there to relax or anything. You were checked 1n, get into your straw, put your things down and off to work, you see. And so I swept the streets for a long time \u2014 not for too long. Then it occurred to me, and you know somebody told me all this. You weren't wise, ghetto wise right of quick. So somebody told me, \"Why don't you try to get into the health system and become a nurse again.\" And of course that sounded like a super idea. And I applied to the Jewish self-government. The ghetto was completely self-governed, but again, just like in Lustig's case, they were complete puppets of the SS And so I applied to get into the nursing phase of the ghetto, and I was lucky. I still have my, my little notice that I could be a nurse and wear a nurse's uniform. That was wonderful. And with that came a little better food also."

I was so sick of those barracks, with all these women, and there was a hostile feeling there because everybody was so \u2014 was so humiliated, and was so sad, and there was no spirit there at all. So I was already very happy to get out of that situation. And then I was detailed to the, to the home for children on Bergstrasse. And in that basement we, the nurses, could make a little nest for ourselves. The basement rooms themselves were, of course, you know very, very poor, very stark. And we had a couple of these bunkbeds \u2014 not a couple, two on each lining the wall. There were many people. And I, by sheer luck, ended up sharing my bunk with a nurse from Vienna \u2014 Eva, Eva Atlas. And apparently I attract light hearted \u00b0\u2019 Group of 100 (German)  37 people because I, myself, I'm on the serious side. So Eva was a very lighthearted, nice, round-faced nurse from Vienna, and we liked each other right away. And somehow everything is easier to bear when you have a friend. I think a lot of us who survived, survived because we had a good friend to share things with. At first, when things were very hard, Eva and I made sure that we always had a little bread. If she was out of bread, I shared mine with her. If I didn't have any more to eat, naturally it was the other way around. So that already helped. And then as our rations \u2014 as we worked harder and harder, the rations became better and better. We had what was called S-Rationen.\u00b0* And at the moment I don't remember what the \u201cS\u201d stood for. Maybe for \u201csneziell\u201d\u201d \u2014 \u201cspecial rations\u201d or something. But it meant a little more bread and a little more soup, and extra coffee. And then things were not so bad anymore. And then we both had friends and admirers. And I had Jirca who worked in the bakery, and he made tiny little Gs for my first name in bread then, \u2018cause I shared that with Eva too. And then things got much better. And, again, we were in a terrible situation. We were completely alone \u2014 Eva as well as myself. We had no hope for a future. We were so worried about daily calls to the Auschwitz transports. That was the big, big Sword of Damocles that was always hanging over. And yet we were young. We were 20, 21 years old. We weren't too badly off. We had a bed to sleep in. We had some food. We had some admirers. What more do you want at 21? So we kind of sailed along, and we did our work. I went a lot, by the way, to that, to that old age home that was right across the street from the nurse's \u2014 from the children's home. Because I had discovered that Frau Frankel, with whom my mother shared an \u2014 who took my mother tn, in Munich \u2014 and I was able to help her out in turn a little bit with my little \u201cG-rations\u201d of bread. And that was good, that was good. And I met other old people there. The old people were hopeless. They had nothing to live for. And they didn't work, so they had very poor rations. So Eva and I did what we could over there after work.:12:31"

She had enough bread right now and she had her work, and she had me, and we could go out before the curfew. We stopped work at seven and the curfew was at eight, so we always went out a little bit. And then, I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the ghetto. By 1943 we had to do what was called \u201cGhetto versch\u00e9nerung\u201d\u201d\u201d \u2014 the beautification of the ghetto. So we got involved in that. And why was there all of a sudden this emphasis on having the ghetto beautiful and representative? As you know, there come \u2014 the International Commission came that following summer. But before the International Commission came, a German pre-commission already came. So the whole ghetto suddenly was buoyed. We were suddenly involved in sowing grass and planting flowers \u2014 and painting the houses and sewing curtains to put into only the downstairs where this commission could walk by. So we suddenly, in our little basement room, we had a little curtain. And then there was cultural beautification as well. Suddenly the SS allowed, and not only allowed, but ordered the Jews to sing and dance, so to say, as their little puppets on a string. But we didn't look behind that. We just knew we could sing again, and walk around, and look at the flowers \u2014 and that's what we did. And Eva, who had a very nice voice, was taken into the choir, and so she had a pass past the curfew to rehearse in the choir and I always went with her. And so she rehearsed the Elijah another, another phenomenon of Theresienstadt. The Elijah is an oratorium which, first of all was written by a Jew \u2014 Mendelssohn\u2019? \u2014 secondly, the context is Jewish. It speaks of that glorification of God, who is \u2014 who punishes the wicked, you see \u2014 who doesn't give fire to the sacrifice of the Baalites, and he punishes them in the end, and they have to go and disappear \u2014 and elaborates and honors, and rewards the Jews \u2014 Elyah and the Jews. How they ever allowed this in the ghetto, I will never know, but I didn't ask any questions. I went and heard Eva sing in the choir, and the melodies are still very much with me. So that was Eva. She took what came. \u201d Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein Stone, rock (German) \u201d Embellishment (German) \u2019\u00b0 Felix Mendelssohn  39:17:19"

I saw Tosca, and I saw Carmen. And you must understand that I saw and heard this with the most magnificent voices there was. The Jewish \u2014 the top \u2014 the cream of the Jewish voices had come to Theresienstadt. The best of the Jewish musicians \u2014 of directors and conductors and everything. And we heard that. Of course it wasn't elaborate. It was in some attic room in that ghetto close. But the voices! I still can't take a mediocre voice because in my youth I heard these magnificent sounds, and that stayed with me. And those people, after they were done singing, went behind the (Inaudible) to the transports. That was the bad thing. But we didn't worry about it so much anymore then. We just lived for the moment. We just lived for that evening when we could go and hear that and enter a new world \u2014 a world of sound, and music, and voices \u2014 the human voice. That was nice. So we enjoyed that.

Not even knowing that after the concert these people would all be shipped out \u2014 or after the Commission left. Even before the Commission left, because the ghetto was overcrowded \u2014 hugely overcrowded. The ghetto always remained at 50,000, but it wasn't the same 50,000. It was a constant new transport coming in and thousands and thousands of people being shipped out. So we were just lucky. We were never called to go into transport. And during the pre-commission, the ghetto was overcrowded. There were probably 60,000 or 70,000, and they couldn't show the Commission an overcrowded ghetto, so they shipped out tens of thousands of people before the Commission came.

            "answer": "Yes. And then, during the International Commission, and already before, they decided that the town would look more normal if that, up to then dead, clock up on the church tower would spring to life. And somehow, I don't know why, he got the job of winding up that clock, and he took me with him a couple of times. And that was a permanent event in my life. I can still see every steep step that I climbed, I climbed up there. And as I got higher and higher, how the fragrant air came through that opening, \u2018cause there was nothing \u2014 1t was open, you see, on the top, and how that wonderful air from the surrounding countrysides.... The ghetto of course had always bad air, also many people, and there was nothing to give air to. And here I came up this was this \u2014 and then the view \u2014 and he could see Prague in the distance. I couldn't, but I think he kind of hoped he could see Prague. That was his home town. But I could see the Elbe and the Eger. That was wonderful blue rivers, unpolluted, and I can still remember how I wished I could swim, and how I almost felt the cool water on my shoulders. We hadn't been swimming since I was a child, you see. And I can still remember how I dreamt that I could dive into that water and feel the water go over my shoulders. And then we heard bird sings. But also as we looked at the beautiful things, we also saw die Kleine Festung.\u2019\u201d One of the features of the ghetto was what was called \"die Kleine Festung.\" That was \u2014 you see, Theresienstadt was a garrison town built in the 1600s or the00s for soldiers, and naturally they had to have like a correction place for soldiers that needed to be punished, and that was die \u2014 a medieval fortress \u2014 a medieval, almost like a torture fortress, where they put the soldiers that needed to be isolated. And they recovered this again from medieval times and put the Jews in there. Took terrible consequences. The Jews there were \u2014 were never returned. It was also, by the way, a historical place. The young man by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914, and started World War I in Sarajevo \u2014 I say \u201cSarajevo\u201d \u2014 You say it differently, don't you? How do you say it? Sarajevo. Sarajevo, which is so much in the news now. That how World War I started as you \u201d The little fortress (German)  45 probably know. It was called, \u201cthe shot that went around the world.\u201d That young man \u2014 that young Princip was imprisoned in the Kleine Festung, and then he died just before the end of the war, and he's buried outside the Kleine Festung. So it has a very historical side to it. So this is what we saw from up on the tower and I only, reluctantly, always, went back down into the ghetto after he took me up there.:38:47"

            "answer": "Nice. I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in front of his home \u2014 his children's home. He was the leader of the children's home. He was already a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself. And then when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work with the children. It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always was able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly. While they were  46 supposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved. He was a very lovely young man \u2014 a real Zionist \u2014 a real ethical figure. And the Germans respected him for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was \u2014 yes, I remember that. A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up \u2014 from Slovakia showed up \u2014 alone \u2014 barefoot, in terrible condition \u2014 and we heard about it. And they didn't speak anything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish. And we... Eva went as a nurse to that transport also. I didn't. I don't know why. That was the one time we didn't do things together. That transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had witnessed that, and they were very frightened \u2014 very intimidated. And the order came from the SS that we were not allowed to speak to them. We were not allowed to know that their parents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were not permitted to speak to us who spoke German. So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and spoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put onto the next transport. And he wrote a card back that I remember. After some time he wrote back that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, \"We should do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our entrance into an east transport.\" And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had it very bad. We had no news from Auschwitz. We did not know how bad they had it, and so we, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we are.:44:09"

We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while they could write, but only for a while. And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon. I surely would have heard from them if they had lived. And when Golly was deported to Auschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her. So, there was something fishy going on and we knew it. But also we \u2014 I think we purposely closed our minds to it. We purposely \u2014 because we were so apt to go into the next transport, and why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we took that out of our minds."

So the answer to your original question is \u201cyes.\u201d It was the Jews who made the transport. Of course it had to be. The Germans didn't do it anymore. Why should they? And it was the Jews who worked in the Schleusse. The Schleusse of course went both ways \u2014 in and out. And who took the people to the cattle cars and everything else? Thank God I never had to do that. I only went to all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew. And, in fact, by then the trains came right into the ghetto. And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and just look out the window and see the people come. Eva and I did that. We watched to see if we knew anybody.:47:20"

In the home it was clean. Now you asked about sanitary conditions. We had, we had to keep that basement room clean, naturally. There was no maid service. And we had to wash our own things in that little faucet. But the big, big problem in Theresienstadt were the bedbugs, and we could not rid ourselves of the bedbugs ever. In the summer, no matter how we tried to keep the beds clean, or anything \u2014 naturally we didn't change beds all that often \u2018cause we had to wash the bedding under that little water and hang it out to dry in the winter. I don't think we ever changed beds. So we had enormous problem with bedbugs \u2014 the whole ghetto. And in the summer we just took a blanket and slept outdoors. And there again it was always that beautiful sky. There were no lights to interfere, you see. The whole, the whole ghetto was blacked out \u2014 number one because they wouldn't spend any of the \u2014 any electricity on us, and number two, it was wartime. We had to be blacked out. We couldn't attract enemy fire. So we slept outdoors under that gorgeous sky. And once in a while the ghetto, house by house, would be de-debugged, and it didn't do a thing. After a week or two the bugs were back. So that was a really big problem. We scratched and scratched, and then those things got infected, and it was a mess. There was nothing we could do, no matter how we tried. And you asked about the water. I have no recollection of it. It was probably drinkable. I don't recall.:57:27"

This was a regular children's home \u2014 babies' home \u2014 for which I actually was trained. That was my diploma. And we, we took care of them as best we could. For instance, I remember we had to wash the diapers out all the time. You know, naturally, I mean what do you expect in the \u201840s in Germany? And hang them up to dry and use them over and over again. And the children stayed with us day and night. The mothers could come and visit. In some cases they nursed and came three times a day, but in most \u2014 in all cases they had to work otherwise, and just came to visit their kids. And I remember we were fairly strict with those mothers. We didn't let them \u2014 we were the bosses, not the mothers, you see. We told them when they could take up their kids and not. We were always afraid they would bring in lice, or bedbugs, or disease, or whatever \u2014 and these were our kids and we were keeping them nice and clean and healthy. We had a physician coming, I don't know how often now. But if one of the kids were sick we sent them to the hospital. And we worked very hard. We had to do everything. We had to clean the rooms, do the washing, we had to feed the kids. The food came in. We didn't have to cook it. So it was an all around job. And we \u2014 in some cases when we got very attached to the children, it was terrible when they were called on transport. And then after a while we hardened against this. We tried not to get attached, but that's hard to do.:03:30"

Otherwise, we didn't do anything with them. They slept, and were fed, and were cleaned, and bathed, and slept again. That was all we did. We  53 couldn't do anything with them.

They were hollow inside, and on top of them there was earth, and there was grass. That was called die Bastei.\u201d\u2019 And later on you could plant vegetables up here, and you could walk up there and have a ballgame up there. But what I'm thinking, at the moment, these urns, 1f you want to call them urns \u2014 it was just in little paper bags with a name on them, were stored in those \u2014 between those huge walls. And for some reason or other I was 1n there once. I don't know why or how I got there. But I remember being there and seeing those rows and rows of \u2014 of little packages with ashes. I have no recollection how I got there. And then, after a while, there were so many that the SS ordered the Jewish government to dispose of them. And then they put them onto a barge, and the barge was taken out into the River Elbe and was sunk. So a lot of people's ashes are sunk in the River Elbe."

We called it \u2014 first of all we talked a lot about food \u201ccause we were always hungry, and we gave it a name. We called it \u201cMagenonanie.*\u201d\u201d It's really a name we made up. \u201cMagen\u201d is your stomach. So it was \u201cStomach-Onanie,\u201d and \u201cOnanie\u201d is masturbation. So we had a very nice time masturbating our stomachs with dreams of food. Of all the things we had eaten, and all the things we're going to be eating again. And that satisfied us for the moment. I think we made up that name. I've never heard it before or since. And then we also dreamt that we would get out. That kept us going. We always dreamt that we, we would survive all this. We were hoping that we wouldn't get into a transport. If we would go into a transport, we knew that was the end. But we were hoping very.... And the big question was if one of us would go into a transport, would the other one voluntarily go along? And we kind of didn't make a decision on that, and thank God it never came up. And then we dreamt that we would get out, and get married, and find love. You see, we were by now 22, 23. Love was not a thing we were very familiar with, aside from these flirtations and these.... You know, somebody once brought me a bunch of flowers that they had picked up on the Bastei, that, that was the height of courtship. You know, that was fabulous. I still remember it, and the smell of them, and the look of them \u2014 and just the whole gesture of receiving flowers, you know. So anyway... So we dreamt we would lead a normal life, and have husbands, and have children \u2014 and then we let our fantasy go wild, and we said, \"And then our children will marry.\" And we promised ourselves our children would marry each other. And, as you know, it did become true. My son \u2014 my daughter and her son married, but not because we wanted it to. I was so surprised when my daughter called up and said, \u201cJoe and I are engaged.\u201d I was the most surprised person in the world. Also, 30 years before that, Eva and I had dreamt about tt.

And I struggled a great deal, but then by the time I married a very religious man, then the struggle was over and I had to come to some, to some peace within myself. And the peace is that there is no answer. That I have to live with a God who 1s good, and not good at the same time. And the answer is that there is no answer, that you have to just, just accept it. But the thing is you have to have something. I can't turn to, to drugs, or to hippy living, or to anything. You have to have something in your life.

I was living in freedom. I had food on the table without end and I couldn't function any further. And my husband, who is a physician, advised me to seek professional help, which was in those days, in the early \u201840s, a stigma. You didn't go to a psychiatrist. You didn't go to a psychologist. You just dealt with your problems. But wisely enough he advised me to get professional help. And the interesting answer was that I had a guilt complex. Now in the early \u201840s that was unheard of. What was a guilt complex? Nobody knew that. Now we know that most people who do go through a hard time come out with a guilt feeling. And my complex was, \"Why me? Why am I living this Life of Riley now? Why not my sister? Why not my husband's sisters? Why wasn't my mother alive to enjoy that baby with me? My husband's mother or father?\" Everybody was gone with the exception of my father, in both our families. And why was I alive? What did I do that guaranteed me such joy? And the normal reaction, as I now know of the mind and the body, is a depression. And I got over it because I got help. And then I also got over it because I felt I had to do something for that gift of life, and I got over it then.:18:35"

            "question": "How did you get out of Theresienstadt?",
            "answer": "That was another miracle. That was another miracle. I can still see Eva and me sitting on our bunks. I can still see that in my mind. We were beginning to be very low, even Eva in all her Viennese humor and gaiety. It was February 1, 1945, and we were sitting on the upper bunk. We changed bunks every so often because the window was right at the upper bunk level, and why should one only look out the window all the time, so we changed bunks, and I don't know whose, whose turn it was, but we were sitting on the upper bunk and watching the cobblestones out in the window, and then somebody came. And all we could see, of course, was just up to their mid-calves. And anyone that ever came brought bad news, or God forbid the slip to go into the transport, so naturally we were \u2014 we stopped our conversation and we were very much afraid. And then the person that came said that the next transport would go to Switzerland, February 1, 1945. The war was on, killing was still in high gear, and somebody was going to take us to Switzerland? And so at first we just ignored it. And then the next morning, we heard it again. And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that were in with the administration, and we heard \u2014 especially we, we young women who were still looking pretty well, we heard, \"Go ahead. Go and register for that transport. Hurry up.\" And so after a while, Eva in her light \u2014 I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my whole life to her \u2014 she said, \"Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's register. Why wait for anything else?\" And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said would go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine. So I said, \"But what if we end up in Auschwitz?\" So she said, \"Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one. Then we're together already anyway. So, nothing to lose. We go.\":21:00  58 So we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports. We were looked over. We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was, \"Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?\" And we had nobody, you see. So we could say \u201cno.\u201d And then we saw him write down that we could get into the transport. And then the next day \u2014 this was all packed into two days, you see. There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any kind. So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that we should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase \u2014 no bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind \u2014 and nicely dressed and punctual. The Germans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your death, you be punctual. So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room, and we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland. We did believe something was different. And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages of marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with. And then we left, Eva and I very much together, and we really got to Switzerland. And when we got to Switzerland, we crossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very much. We looked out the window. Number one, nobody yelled us, \"Get back in or you'll be shot,\" you know. And number two, the people smiled. I hadn't seen a person smile in 12 years. What was there to smile at? All through my youth and my growing up. The people smiled at us. And the person that \u2014 then some Swiss people in uniform came tn and they were nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone 1n uniform being nice to Jews. What's this? Gan Eden?\u201d\u00ae Already we're dead and we're in paradise. Was unheard of. And then the third thing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on. There was no war in Switzerland, you see. The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was Switzerland and wouldn't bomb it. But to us it was an epiphany. It was unheard of. So then we were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed together and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also come, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone. And I contacted my father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married. And by gosh when our kids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean\u201d fell in love with Polly\u201d \u2014 right under my eyes, and I didn't see it happen. And I didn't know for many years just how that all came about. May I tell you just very quickly.:24:38 Maybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I discovered it myself. It wasn't told to me. I went to the National Archives. I had an advisor, Tim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and read them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of Recha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit \u2014 approached \u00b0\u00b0 Garden of Eden (Hebrew) *\u00b0 Jean Hammel * Polly Haas-Hammel  59 Jean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss \u2014 a former Swiss President. First she thought she wanted her mother and father to be taken out of Germany. Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he had rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out. And then, she thought, \u201c\u201cWhy not try to get all the Jews out?\u201d It was late in the war, and she asked him to contact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a certain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany. And by gosh he agreed. This is now, of course, I'm condensing this very much. He agreed. Musy went to Germany to meet him first in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed. And I saw the correspondence between him and \u2014 Himmler and Musy \u2014 and then later with Sternbuch. He wanted first \u2014 first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course didn't do that. In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va\u2019ad Ha-Hatsala, which 1s the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada. And they had formed this Va\u2019ad, just for the purpose of helping the Jews \u2014 the war was ending \u2014 whom they knew would come and needed help, even in Europe. And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed to collect money to buy out the Jews.:26:53 In the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to be of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I have said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come. And then Hitler \u2014 and the condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and American press. Why? Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly before him. After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to whitewash himself. He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended. And this was done without Hitler's knowledge. And Hitler heard about it. When the first 1,200 Jews came out, he heard about it. And he immediately disinherited Himmler. Himmler had to flee, and he forbade every other contact \u2014 every other release \u2014 Jews or non-Jews \u2014 nobody leaves Germany anymore. So we were the only transport. And Musy, who it is believed enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity. Nobody heard from him. Then he died. He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse with Himmler. But he died later. Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later \u2014in \u201871. And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him \u2014 and he wandered around Luneburger Heide which 1s a place \u2014 a lonely place in Germany, and then he had to flee from the Allies. It was the English \u2014 the British that captured that part of Germany. And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took cyanide and killed himself. And then they knew it was Himmler. It was too late. And I was saved. He tried to save himself and he saved me instead. Isn't that a miracle? I was number,400\u2014 number 1,174 out of those 1,200."

He was so associated with my youth, and so, so beloved by me that, that was a bond that never dissolved. And then they invited me their house, and the children were all very small, and it was a homecoming for me, you see. And now I have long forgiven him that. I didn't even think about it anymore. It just came back to me now as I was thinking about Ansbach. But you know, the normal measurements of ethics do not apply to the years of the Holocaust. They just don't apply. Was everybody justified in trying to save his or her own life? Were people justified in trying to save their own baby, knowing that if that baby wasn't taken, another mother's baby would have to be substituted? Was I justified to let my mother and sister? Was my father justified to leave us? You cannot apply those normal moral standards to the Holocaust years. You just can't. You just can't. So I have long forgiven him that he saved his life, and his whole family's life. Why should that whole family also have disappeared? And he has since done so much good. He's been such an outstanding Rabbi. And then we were not bound to obey him even though he said, \"Stay. Everything will *' Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovitz  61 be okay.\" Many people left. We could have left too, and we did after a while. So that's a whole other philosophical problem that you just can't allow yourself to get into it. You get lost in the swamp.:33:59"

He first worked for some other Jewish kosher butchers in Washington Heights in New York, and then he and his brother opened their own little butcher shop \u2014 Schild Brothers \u2014 and they became quite successful, but always within the German Jewish community. And you see his fear of anyone non Jewish also never left him. He also carried the scar even though he didn't go through the worst. But he told me once when somebody came into the store that spoke English, they immediately were afraid. They immediately thought it was someone to inspect the store, or to make trouble, or to want something from them. You see, we all, we all have our scars. You can't go through this without scars \u2014 you just can't. So he was always afraid of anyone not Jewish as well. Those were the enemies. But he lived to a ripe old age. He married again  62 \u2014a woman who was in Theresienstadt and lost her husband and two children there. I never knew her there \u2014 I couldn't, it was much too big to know people. We were so restricted and then she was much older. I didn't readily associate or become friendly with people of my parents' age. I stayed very much with my own age, and possibly with the very old people that I went to visit. But I never knew her, and she was very good to him \u2018til the day he died. And he only died about nine years ago at the age of 92. He remained very religious. We became very close too at the end. He never spoke \u2014 I always thought he would say something, at least on his deathbed still, that he shouldn't have left us, or something like that, but he never did. This is another thing I, I don't understand.:38:54"

I could not find a way to him, and he, he was obviously guilt ridden too. He never really asked. Then toward the very end he gave me my mother's letters, and then, then he was already mellowed, and he gave me my sister's letters, and my own letters.

            "num": 185,
            "question": "What did you do?",
            "answer": "Well, two things \u2014 one egotistical and the other altruistic. The egotistical first. I got myself an education. I went to college. My husband, my husband was always very understanding of me. He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could. And by then \u2014 this took a while. My first depression occurred after my first baby was born. And then I still was very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that was in authority \u2018cause that was dangerous up \u2018til then. So then after a while I missed very much that I didn't have an education. And after a while then I went to Bates College in Lewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students. See now, this is different. This was in the \u201850s \u2014 in the \u201860s. I graduated in \u201871. I was only the second person of non\u2014 of not eighteen years old. I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright. I graduated with a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it. And then I was done. And then I didn't know what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, \"Go to graduate school. Become a librarian,\" \u2018cause I liked books. And I did that and again I graduated, so now what? So he said, \"Take a job. Be a librarian.\" And Bates College took me as a librarian, and I was very happy there during the years.:42:22 And then the second part comes in \u2014 the altruistic part if I may say so. Then I began to realize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college. When my husband became college physician in \u2014 soon after our marriage, in the early \u201850s, he was only the second Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some0 years or so \u2014 and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities. And they didn't know Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust. So an opportunity presented itself, ready made, and I stepped in. I got myself funding from the National Humanities Counsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College. I did programs of Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people could hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves, \"What is Judaism? What are Jews? What are the finer points of it?\" And really, I was quite successful. I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived died. This was all back in Maine. We settled in Maine. When he died I was instrumental in getting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph) Jewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library. I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special library. And that drew Jewish interest. And from that library \u2014 I used that again as my platform \u2014 I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in. I had Hilberg. \u201d\u201d I had Lansky\u201d of the Yiddish Center. I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music. I\u2014 who me? I brought all these * Raul Hilberg * Aaron Lansky  64 people in and I educated them. Then finally I saw a need \u2014 the people wanted to teach the Holocaust and they didn't know what to do. They didn't know how to teach it. So out of that activity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the end, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of helping the teachers teach the Holocaust. And that was a very fine success. I moved out of Maine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course. We have a teachers' guidebook. We have all kinds of things, were successful. And then I felt better. I don't have a \u2014 I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore. And I speak all around the country. And I hear students \u2014 I see there is a necessity to speak, because the students know only democracy. The constant question is, \"Well, why didn't you just not go,\" you know. Or, \"Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?\" Or, \"How come you had to give your house up?\" They don't understand this. They're living in a democracy. They don't understand what it is to live in an autocracy. So I still \u2014 I still feel a need to talk and to write, and to answer questions. And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even younger children, because they need to know.:46:30"

I think that's in Ansbach \u2014 near our house. It's not in front of our house. Siegfried and Paula Schild \u2014 very clear. Oh, that's a picture in Ansbach in our back yard. That's my grandmother Sophie on the one side, and my Aunt Berta and a cousin visiting. And that's in the, in the yard where the chickens ran around, and the very background there, that was my father's sausage room where he made the sausage. And on the side, I think that ** Five (German)  65 was our compost heap, if I'm not mistaken. That was very rural, but happy times. That was still in grade school though. That's a class picture still in grade school \u2014 still happy. I'm the one with the pigtails on the top row, fourth from the right, skinny little gal \u2014 and still quite happy. That must have been.... How old could I have been there? Eight or nine? Oh, then we're already 16 or so \u2014 no, not quite. I'm not on that picture. My sister Friedl is the one on the right hand side with the short hair; one of the few pictures I have of her. Of that whole group only two survived, and I'm still friendly with them. And my poor sister was, of course, one of the victims. Yep, that's my sister Friedl. Yes, that was the youth group we had, always clustered around our beloved Rabbi, Eli Munk, and his wife there with the shaytel on, on his right, and on the right of Mrs. Munk is my sister Friedl \u2014 there, there she is. That's Friedl. And I'm there too. I'm in back between Mrs. Munk and Friedl, with the pigtails, and those were such happy times. It was probably Shabbos afternoon when we were singing zmiros > and he was telling us stories, and those were such happy times. Most everybody else is gone in that picture, but it was the same. And that's Elie Munk again in the back, and all the boys \u2014 probably having another session with him and Mrs. Munk. And that was our Hebrew teacher that fellow in the back.

Oh, another picture from my happy youth, also in our back yard, the smokestack between Friedl and me is where my father smoked all the sausages, and on my left shoulder there, that's my father's grinding stone. He sharpened up Songs (Hebrew)  66 his butcher knives there. I can still see that, and that's really the chicken yard right there \u2014 the chicken house \u2014 in back of the grindstone \u2014 and my mother's laundry hanging there \u2014 and Friedl and I just hanging out, as they would say now...

There's my father, and Friedl and I, and my cousin Edith, the same one that was in the picture before \u2014 a very sweet little girl. She came to us for summer vacations every year, and we always were happy together. Ah, another picture of my happy youth. That was an outing with the whole group. It was called the JJA; the Jewish Youth Group of Ansbach. And that's Friedl, the very \u2014 the white figure on the right hand side \u2014 on the very right. And that's me, the second from the left. There I'm already a tall girl. Also, I was the younger one. I very soon was taller than Friedl as you can already see here.
