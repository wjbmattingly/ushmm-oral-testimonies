Because as soon as he \u2014 the word got around that he was \u2014 he ha \u2014 had left the city with his wife and daughter, they took him to the mainland, to the mountains in central Greece.

And so the resistance movements were also polarized. You have EDES, headed by Napoleon Zervas in Epirus, and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance movement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of \u2014 of Greece. And so we had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised us to go to a territory controlled by EAM-ELAS. So we had some very close family friends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three sisters. There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros, and we knew them, we became fam \u2014 we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man who was a colleague of my father\u2019s in \u2014 in the bank. I think we met \u2014 they met them either in Preveza or Arta, I don\u2019t know. And unfortunately her husband, Elestair\u2019s husband died, and the whole family moved to Agrinion and they lived \u2014 and so she and her children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas(ph) and Kostas Bokoros. So, we decided to ask them for help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything they could to assure us that we\u2019ll find you a place, we\u2019ll get you out of the city. And so after we distributed our belongings to the neighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we \u2014 we sent some of the material, clothing and food and household utensils, with a porter to transport these things to the Bokoros\u2019 house, and then we, the three of us, my mother, my brother and I followed behind.

And so we reached the Bokoro \u2014 Bokoros\u2019 house, and a few minutes later \u2014 I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I remember a German bursting into the house and \u2014 and then my mother, you know, she saw this \u2014 she saw him, and she quickly pushed him in \u2014 pushed me into the adjacent room and she quickly pulled the covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the bed, as though she belonged there. She\u2019s a very quick thinker, sh \u2014 amazing person. So th-the \u2014 the German sort of looked around. I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know what \u2014 who he was looking for, and then he left. But 1t was a very frightening experience for \u2014 for \u2014 for all \u2014 for my mother and \u2014 and my brother. I don\u2019t remember where my brother was at this point. All I remember was my mother making the bed at this point. And she asked Christos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the bank and tell my father to \u2014 to drop everything and come to the house, we had to leave immediately. So Christos goes to the bank, and told my father that \u2014 does he have \u2014 even though you haven\u2019t finished counting the money, you have to drop everything and leave. An-And certainly the people in the bank were very cooperative. They signed everything as though they had cou \u2014 as the mon \u2014 as though the money had been counted and everything, or the transaction was very orderly. And so my father comes to the Bokoros house. And then, where there\u2019s another problem they confront is the lack of transportation. The Germans had requisitioned all means of transportation; trucks, taxis, mules, horses. And so the brothers This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so we spent the night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi that was going to Kremasta. This was a spa near the river Acheloos river, nearby. Was so-some distance, few kilometers outside Agrinion. And he had \u2014 the taxi driver had other passengers to transport to the \u2014 the the Acheloos spa. And so this is we \u2014 we got in the tax1 with some blankets, and you know, some household ma \u2014 equipment, materials that we brought with us, and so we left the city. I remember that, I remember how my mother said we should crouch into the \u2014 the taxi, not to draw attention to ourselves, because people did not use taxis then to \u2014 to \u2014 to move around, we didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to draw attention to ourselves. And then as soon as we \u2014 we came to the outskirts of the city of Agrinion, we had to pass through a German checkpoint. And the driver, who apparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there, and he gave them some raisins and cigarettes, and they let us pass. And then \u2014"

And that\u2019s exactly what we did, this Spyros, Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 son guided us to the \u2014 to the cave, and that again, I have a firsthand recollection. I remember this very vividly as a child going into a cave. It was quite an experience, and I was \u2014 I was frightened. I was frightened at first, because it was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very dark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites.

It was like an alcove, and we spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark cave. And \u2014 and my father, he \u2014 he always tried to calm everybody down, and \u2014 and he \u2014 this a \u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014 was a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his exploits, ab \u2014 as a soldier going up to the \u2014 to the front, the Albanian \u2014 Greek Albanian front or \u2014 and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to entertain us.

I-I don\u2019t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I\u2019m not positive. And so, it was hours that we had to s \u2014 to spend in this alcove, in the dark \u2014 semi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed with minerals, would drip down into a \u2014 a pond at the bottom of the \u2014 of the cave. And then suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas. And we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. And so we decided not to \u2014 to say anything, to keep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas, then he said I\u2019m \u2014 this is Spyros.

We have rice and beans, we have \u2014 we even have candles. We have things that we never had before. And I \u2014 I was very impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the \u2014 my friends, they told me they have all this good stuff. And immediately my parents suspected that the owner of the house was the one who looted the room, and my father confronted him, and he denied that he \u2014 he took anything. And my father persisted, and he had to accept to \u2014 the fact that \u2014 he had to admit that he did take a few things. He was afraid of my father talking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. And so he returned a few items. But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden somewhere. And so my father searched the \u2014 the barn and other hidden \u2014 possible This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And oil was a real treasure, because was \u2014 this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very valuable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of food. So my parents were infuriated with this man because he \u2014 he really \u2014 he created the situation that we \u2014 we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. So they considered bringing this matter to the people\u2019s court. There were people\u2019s courts then, in villages. They were not official courts, but they were \u2014 consisted of the elders of the village, and all sorts of ma \u2014 matters of \u2014 disputes were brought to the people\u2019s court. And the people\u2019s court was actually very severe in punishments that \u2014 that they imposed on people. So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter. And that they also didn\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves. So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to another house to live in. This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. This one had two rooms, one room was a Kafeneio, a caf\u00e9. And the other room was the room that we occupied, and th \u2014 and it had a basement. And so \u2014 so that was a big change, it was \u2014 we adjusted to it very quickly. But the main concern now was food. There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion, but had come to the village for the summer, and they stayed on because of the \u2014 the war situation. But they had decided to return to Agrinion. And they had a lot of wheat with them. So my father, being a bank This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the bank. It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to Psilovrahos, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat. But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this point and \u2014 and he could have made the Yovanos(ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for \u2014 for himself. And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when \u2014 after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and \u2014 and asked them for their forgiveness, because by \u2014 by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. So \u2014 so th-that is the situation now, we are \u2014 we have very little food. We do have this oil that the villager brings from the village, and this wheat. Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. It\u2019s a \u2014a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is \u2014 that \u2014 that 1s in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it\u2019s a very nutritious food and very filling. So \u2014 so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for \u2014 for Trachanas or corn meal. Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It was a very difficult situation and there\u2019s winter approaching, it\u2019s already winter. It 1s cold. And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that \u2014 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging clothing for food. Or, she did other things. She knitted for people. She was \u2014 she had many skills. She knew how to make lace. An-And one \u2014 one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to \u2014 to knit. I di\u2014 can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so \u2014 and said, there are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food. And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters. They had prepare seven dowries. So she went to \u2014 started with them. And she\u2019d go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they had. So they ha \u2014 my parents had to start rationing the food. It was less and less every day. And I \u2014 I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees and fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when spring and summer come, th-they\u2019ll be full of figs. And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking underneath those trees, waiting for someday to see figs up on the tree."

            "answer": "The money was worthless, yes, yes. One wonderful thing happened during this period of \u2014 of, literally, starvation. A group of partisans, or andartes, as they were known, they came to the village and they camped there, they \u2014 they settled there for 20 days. There were 60 of them. I don\u2019t know why they settled in the village, but my parents recognized there was an opportunity for us to get food. And it was either my father or brother who approached the captain of this band, and described our desperate situation and asked them if they could help us. And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of a \u2014 of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. And so my brother, when the \u2014 the bugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of \u2014 of a partisan, which was not very much. It was just corn soup and a piece of corn bread. But for us it was God sent. And he did that twice a day, and we would share the food, and \u2014 and that was for 20 days. That was quite a \u2014 a long time. So that was the situation. I don\u2019t know at what point my parents \u2014 my mother decided that she should use \u2014 not \u2014 to sell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. I don\u2019t know whether it was in that \u2014 in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this bright idea of \u2014 of using the cases \u2014 we had brought mattress cases. In Greece \u2014 in Greece you protect everything you have, like mattress, you have to have a case for the mattress, to protect it from dust. And so we \u2014 when we came to the village, we brought these mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make mattresses. So my mother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

These \u2014 the villagers are dressed in rags. And \u2014 but these mattress cases, usually, they have very bright stripes, red stripes. So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with these bright stripes. And then he thought further and said well, we \u2014 we can dye them, we can dye them brown. And that was my father\u2019s great opportunity to experiment and he \u2014 he said, we\u2019ll gather shells of \u2014 walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the fields, and \u2014 and poppies. So this must have happened 1n the spring, early spring, and there are lots of poppies in \u2014 growing in \u2014 in the mountains. So he made this concoction, boiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped these mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they turned brown. Later on I found out that \u2014 that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye wool and \u2014 and fabric. So \u2014 so my mother made pants for \u2014 for boys, and then she used sheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. And so she had all these wares to exchange for food, then she went from village to village with my brother, doing that. And she\u2019d come home with \u2014 with cheese or bread or \u2014 everything was delicious to us, anything was delicious."

But again my father, he invented something, he experimented with pieces of rubber from the tires, car tires, that the village cobbler was using to repair shoes. He would use the material from tires as soles for shoes. And so he collected scraps of rubber and burned them.

So that was the situation in the winter. It was a very desperate situation. Then when spring came, there were \u2014 things were a little better because they gave us a short \u2014 a small plot to cultivate. And then there were mulberries. The mulberry trees plentiful, which caused \u2014 and we lived on mulberry berries for a number of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that. But it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did. That is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down to the city and bring a horse-load of food. And \u2014 and there were groups of villagers that were going to the city. And she said, Ill just join one of them and go down into the city.

He sings them to this day. I\u2014I learned a few of them, but he was the one who \u2014 who sang them, and he had a beautiful voice, he still does. So now I will come back to the \u2014 to this encounter of my mother with Mrs. Volis(ph). So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as possible. She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that \u2014 n-now my mother actually, even at this point, she said \u2014 she insisted that she go into the city, in spite of all this. She said, we\u2019re starving, we \u2014 we have to get some food. And so her husband recommended that she go to another village called Kamaroula, where he has a kombarro(ph). Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. And his name was Christos Zambarros(ph), and he \u2014 he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. So my mother started walking alone with this horrible knowledge of \u2014 of what had happened to our people, to Kamaroula.

And so they said, take this ker \u2014 they gave her a kerchief quickly, said put it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from Psilovrahos. Don\u2019t say anything. They sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha \u2014 what happened, and begged him to \u2014 to go \u2014 I think \u2014 I think what happened \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their store \u2014 the food supplies. I don\u2019t know where this meeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and understood the situation, and he said, don\u2019t worry. I will go down to \u2014 into the city, and I will do my best to bring a horse-load of \u2014 of food. So in the meantime, my mother was waiting in this country home with this deaf mute aunt. This \u2014 Kamaroula was very close to Agrinion. And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not allow any food to leave the city. And they had \u2014 they had executed resistance fighters already in the city, about 200 of them. So the situation had really become very hard, very tough. And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your neighbors, were tea, a bottle \u2014 a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. Very useful things, but not what we expected. So \u2014 so my mother took this me \u2014 these few items and started walking back to our city \u2014 to the village. And at one point she \u2014 she met Pepola(ph) Hannah(ph). He was a re \u2014 a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So they fell into each other\u2019s arms and they cried and it was a very, very emotional experience for my mother. But she had to rush \u2014I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the mountains. They have left their \u2014 their families to \u2014 to save themselves, and they joined the resistance. Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the \u2014 the andartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families, and so they returned. But a number of them stayed in the mountains. So they had to rush to \u2014 Christos(ph) and my mother \u2014 th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after sundown, and it was close to sundown. So they climbed a hill, and at the top of the hill was a little chapel, a little church that Christos\u2019 grandfather had built. And so they spent the night there, and this was Saint Elias chapel. And then the next day they said goodbye, and there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this place, Kamaroula, all the way to Psilovrahos, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time. So when she came back, at that point my brother, my f\u2014 and my father were outdoors working on this plot of land that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her coming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn\u2019t we tell you not to go?

And so she told us, and we were \u2014 we were just devastated. And I remember this scene. I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. Her eyes were \u2014 her \u2014 her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained. So we were just \u2014 just \u2014 just shocked. It took us \u2014 took a long time for \u2014 to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krak\u00e9w, Poland, because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika, that they were being relocated to \u2014 to Krakow to establish their own Jewish community, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted. So we thought that th \u2014 these Jews as well, from Ioannina, Arta and Preveza, that that was their destination. And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but \u2014 but what can we do in \u2014 we\u2019re in this remote village, what can we do? But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village, because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes. Helping the resistance. The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in Greece. But we \u2014 my father knew of this British mission, and he said we \u2014 we \u2014 we have to contact them. We should write letters and we should send a letter to the \u2014 he said, the nations of the world have to know what\u2019s happening, they have to do something to stop it.

So \u2014 so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt, and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in Egypt. It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and \u2014 and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. They didn\u2019t know where Priantza was, they had to \u2014 to ask many people to find their way to Priantza. So they finally arrive in Priantza and the \u2014 the British officials are willing to meet with them. And my mother, when she came back, she described that they \u2014 they walked into a large room, and they sat on two chairs, my brother and \u2014 and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they \u2014 they begged them to deliver these letters. And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn\u2019t sound very reassuring. In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it was his wife and children or \u2014 or some other relative, they \u2014 you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in London, and \u2014 and that \u2014 I have to bear that loss. So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. I don\u2019t know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to \u2014 to anybody. But one \u2014 one good thing that they discovered while in Priantza, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were \u2014 th-they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So much of it they didn\u2019t know what to do with it. And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it\u2019s like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. And so when they returned home after their mission, my brother came into the hou \u2014 room with this big bundle of parachute material. And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on. But I \u2014 from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th There weren\u2019t many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of the Jews. And \u2014 and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they were relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. We were \u2014 my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be \u2014 they\u2019II be able to survive.

So my father actually had to \u2014 to go from villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen.

So we \u2014 from \u2014 from this location, we were able to see fires being set on the villages below. And it was, you know, one village after the other being set on fire, systematically. And they had reached our village, Psilovrahos, and they began to burn those houses as well.

So now we have quite a bit of wheat to transport into the city. So \u2014 so my brother and \u2014 and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) and the mule, or horse, I don\u2019t know what it was, they come down into the city. I \u2014 I I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m glad that I\u2014 you asked me this question, because I didn\u2019t say anything about Baba(ph) Yoros(ph). There was a time, after the first time that \u2014 which was in November \u2014 when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis\u2019 house. There was another time when we had to leave the village. I don\u2019t remember which month it was, but this time my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had. So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she spoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. I don\u2019t know, this is a story that I\u2019m not very clear on. But \u2014 so my mother and I slept in the room, and then early next morning we hear a knock on the door. And we woke up, and there was Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a partisan. And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your child? If the Germans were to come to the village and \u2014 and take you and your child, I will never, ever forgive myself. And so when my mother heard that, she ha \u2014 didn\u2019t have to hear anything more, she packed quickly and \u2014 and \u2014 and she packed more than \u2014 than she could carry, and she \u2014 in her memoir she says how she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to leave the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this \u2014 the \u2014 the mother of this \u2014 of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and crocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and \u2014 and she saw my mother in \u2014 in this \u2014 in distress, and she said, oh don\u2019t worry, I will carry all of your belongings. And so, with her, we reached the upper village, and \u2014 and so this is how we stand this time when the \u2014 the Germans \u2014 that was their second foray into our region, but this time they never reached the village, and \u2014 and so \u2014 and so we all returned. So this is Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) who played a significant part in \u2014 in our story. As I said, th-the people really \u2014 they tried to \u2014 to help in any way they \u2014 they could, including th-the priest. You know, we \u2014 we used to go to the church, first of all to \u2014 not to show that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a \u2014 a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. It\u2019s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we\u2019d go there and \u2014 and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us. And the priest, I don\u2019t remember his name. Papa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. I don\u2019t remember his name. He used to come to our house quite often, because he befriended my parents. And my mother would always serve him coffee, which was a rare find, a ra \u2014 a re \u2014 a real treat for him. And he would chat with my father. I don\u2019t know what they talked about, but we went to \u2014 attended even Easter This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And this is the ttme when \u2014 I learned later on, you know, after the war, I \u2014 I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than \u2014 than the Jewish religion. But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and \u2014 and he\u2019s dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to \u2014 to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his \u2014 his life t-to save you. He\u2019s \u2014 and so he would \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he would ha \u2014 he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. So 1-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents. He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I\u2019m expected to do that, I\u2019m expected to give this kind of sermon. So now, go back to my brother and Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), they\u2019re returning to the villa \u2014 to Agrinion. And so my \u2014 my brother arrived with \u2014 with food, to Agrinion. And then, after a few days, my parents and I came down into the city."

And they \u2014 and she said that the neighbors \u2014 there was also a woman, Stavrypoulo(ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts\u2019 house at the time, and she was a mistress of one of the German officers who lived in my aunt\u2019s house, Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s house. And my aunt \u2014 my uncle \u2014 Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s husband Naseem(ph) Samwheel(ph) was a dentist, and they were well-off, they had a very pretty house, very comfortable.

And their \u2014 a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was frantic, because what are we going to do? How 1s the \u2014 the mother and the baby going to survive? And \u2014 and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-don\u2019t worry, Ill deliver the baby. I know all about babies, I\u2019ll take care of you. So I don\u2019t know whether she delivered \u2014 whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar, or when they arrived in the concentration camp. But I do know that they were among the first people to \u2014 to go to the gas chambers, because they \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014 they took the elderly and the very young to the gas chambers. And so that was the end of these wonderful people. It\u2019s something [indecipherable] my brother and I live with this \u2014 this pain all our lives.

And the walls are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people who were deported, on marble plaques with the day of \u2014 the date of their birth \u2014 the names and the date of their birth. And th-the entire synagogue interior is \u2014 1s covered with these plaques. It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the \u2014 a younger brother of my father, wa \u2014 he\u2019s a survivor of the concentration camp, he\u2019s the one who collected all the information; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished, and then they etched their names in marble an-and \u2014 and there is a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014a good monument, you know, a way to remember them. But it 1s \u2014 it is so painful to think \u2014 when I was in that synagogue, I \u2014 I had already learned a lot about the history of \u2014 of the community, and how rich their lives were, rich in \u2014 in long traditions, they \u2014 these unchanged traditions for hundreds of years. And it all perished overnight, literally overnight. So with \u2014 with my aunt \u2014 with my cousin Nina, when we were in the synagogue, and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is how he survived, he joined them as a young man. Now, when I visited he was an elderly person. But he \u2014 he had a beautiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument. And he took it upon himself to \u2014 to learn the liturgy, because he\u2019s the one who condu \u2014 conducts services in the synagogue, only very few times, on like Yom Kippur.

And so \u2014 so he \u2014 he chants the liturgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin Nina, a survivor of Auschwitz; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. And it was the most memorable moment of my life. And when I looked at the wall, there were the names of our relatives, and \u2014 and cousins that were my age when they were taken. And I s-sort of \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014TI appreciate life. I\u2019m very conscious that I was \u2014 I was just very, very, very lucky to survive. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m one of the very few \u2014 among the very few Greek Jewish survivors. And \u2014 and now I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m eternally grateful to whoever ever helped us to survive those terrible years. And there were many people with small acts of \u2014 of \u2014 just a kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in Kamaria, or \u2014 or the blanket, 1n spite of the lice, they \u2014 they shared everything they had, and I am \u2014 we\u2019re the \u2014 eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of Psilovrahos.
