stayed there for like two months and they liquidated that little ghetto. And from that little ghetto
they left maybe 200 people that worked for those huts in that big factory. When they liquidated
that little ghetto from the 2000 people that they have left, they took 200 to send them to that
factory to work. And the 1800 they dispersed in different camps in Poland. They really took me
out to be sent to one of those camps. When I, when they took me out, I kind of sneaked, tried to
sneak back in, and the Jewish policeman that watched that nobody should sneak back in, he
knew me very well. And I knew them and I used to play with his daughter.

camps in Poland. And I stayed and then as I said they liquidated that small little, they took us to
that to the factory, where we were. And I stayed there til I went to Buchenwald.

but since I had brothers that stayed and I going to go to the factory to live. I figured I want to
stay with them. And I was lucky that that policeman was standing at that time and let me go
through.

us a place to wash. And we told her what kind of food we want. It was an old lady and she says
well I'll give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want, you’re going to
die. We were underweight and she knew where we came from so she said that’s too fat for you.
And this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didn’t’ feed us the proper food. So
we said ok give us whatever you have but we’re hungry. And she did. Little by little she gave us
food that she felt without fat. And we stayed with her for a few weeks. Until the Russian, we
escaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically
next to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that
time. And just across if you run out from the camp, from Mauthausen, you were on the Russian
side. But if you were in the camp, you were on the American side. So we were on the Russian
side. And one night the Russians came in, soldiers came in to the apartment and they knew that

Katie St. John: This is Katie St. John taking over for Gail Schwartz in the interview of Nathan
Neiberg on July 24, 2015. So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the
war. So could you tell us a little about that?
Nathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna,
the Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied
us with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town
in Poland to see who’s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people
walked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that
the war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what’s
going on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they
said don’t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don’t look at it, don’t look at
us welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few
Jewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family.
So we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in,
there’s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary.
Find the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you’ll know
more so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a
train to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn’t have to pay for
the seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I
came into Hungary and I didn’t’ meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact
they told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn’t know where they are or

they didn’t’ see them but they heard from other people that they came across that they feel that
some of the Neibergs, Neiberg brothers stayed alive. They don’t know which ones. They might
have think about me but they didn’t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee
camp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the
refugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It
was not Israel yet there.
Q: And what were the camps like?
A: In Hungary. Decent. Well any place you went after the concentration camps in Germany
and throughout the war, once it ended, nothing was in comparison to the concentration camps. So
whatever you did, it was always a little better then. So the question 1s that how was it. It was
better. But was it good. No, it was just better that you had more food to eat. You weren’t hungry
and you had some clean clothes to wear. The rest ok.
Q: Is there anything specific that you remember from your time there?
A: From Hungary?
Q: From the refugee camp, yes.
A: From the refugee. Not really, not really. It was normal you know. As I came, as a
refugee camp was, which was mainly that you survived, that you’re not in danger of being killed

and being beaten up or had to go to work. To work that was it was a horrible type of work. But
anything, you survived in the camps. You couldn’t’ complain for, there was quite a few a lot of
refugees that they just welcomed, and they did a decent job at whatever they could. No
complaints. And then from, so I joined one of those Zionist groups. And decide that Zionist, the
leaders decided that well we it’s time to move on. We left Hungary and strived to reach Italy.
Q: Why Italy?
A: Because from Italy they formed there refugee camps in Italy. That was already refugee
camps. And from Italy kind of striving to reach Palestine. That was the last stop before trying to
reach Palestine. Or you went to France. But we picked Italy. So to reach Italy we had to go
back to Austria. And we came back to Austria we stayed there for again, for like a month and
finally the Jewish brigade that was serving the English army they helped the Jewish group,
Zionist group reaching Italy with their trucks. It was not legal that they did it but they did it.
Then we went through the Alps from Austria to avoid usual borders. Then we reached northern
Italy, coming through the Alps. And we were left in Modena, Italy in Modena. It’s close to
Bologna kind of. It’s a nice, nice town. And there was also a Jewish refugee camp kind of that
they formed. And we stayed in Bologna a while. Then we left Modena to southern Italy which
was Santa Maria. You have it in here.

A: Yes. And stayed in Santa Maria for a while, naturally with the Zionist groups. And we
decided from the Zionist group decided really, the leaders of the Zionist group decided that there
was a ship which was called the Moleta and they said that you might leave with that ship. And
we left with that ship and we reached Cyprus.
Q: And why that ship?
A: Well that was available. It was that ship was bought through the Zionist groups through
the United States. It was a really a kind of a fishing boat you would say more so. But it was an
enlarged fishing boat, a luxury fishing boat kind of. And we left in the at that particular time was
the blockade of the British navy that they wouldn’t let the Jews into Israel, to Palestine, I mean.
And they used to know the kind of route we took from Italy to Palestine and they were
controlling that particular route. And they always used to catch the illegal ships trying to come to
Palestine. And we were caught by them and we were brought to Haifa. They took us off from
the ships that we came on. They were raiding us. Well we had a light fight with them before they
took us, took over the ship. We threw at them rotten tomatoes and they got a little angry with us
but it was over and they attached us to their ship and brought us into Haifa. In Haifa we had to
leave the ship that we came on and they transferred us to a, to one of their ships. And they took
us to Cyprus.
Q: And how many other people were you with?
A: I would say another kind of at 100, between 150 to 100 people that we were.

A: Correct yes and we were taken to Cyprus and must be familiar with Cyprus Camps right.
Ok so we stayed in Cyprus for quite a while. From Cyprus when they declared the state of Israel
naturally they let us go to come into Israel at that time. And —
Q: While you were in Cyprus what were you doing?
A: While Cyprus was a camp that you just were imprisoned. We were not doing anything
really. Except we were doing you know in groups things to send out great teachers from
Palestine and we used to study the Bible, all these, all kinds of lessons. There was kind of like a
formed school that whoever wanted to attend was welcome there. This was the major things that
we did. There was no work to be done. Yeah there was work that we all had to day, give a day in
the kitchen about wash dishes or something of that nature so we all always were available if they
needed some people but as far as really working, there was no work.
Q: Just focusing on your education.
A: Correct. Just on education and English supplied the food and it was ok. Can’t complain
that they didn’t gas or beat you up there. It was normal way of life, a normal way of life in the
camp. Being imprisoned. And naturally we stayed in Cyprus, the Jewish group, in that camp
until they declared the state of Israel. Soon as they declared the state of Israel, they all let us out.

meant to be the head of the sailors. Kind of, it was a kind of a little rank. And stayed there like

Interview with Nathan Neiberg 62
A: Well it was the war like any other war. You know. it’s nothing special. You got your
you know maneuvers and fightings but I was in the Army. The Navy saw very little fightings.
Because it was skirmishes but nothing special. Just watched the borders. The water borders on
the Mediterranean. And that was, that was the end and then that as I said I got into the
administration and worked at Haifa port. That was the end of it.
Q: One more question. I’m curious of people who were Holocaust survivors who were
fighting in the war of independence. Did their experience in the concentration camp make them
more tougher as soldiers. Did they, did you see people who were —
A: We made yes, anger yes, but tougher soldiers no. The sabras was just as tough. As us.
they were just as angry and dedicated as we were. We weren’t any more dedicated than they,
really born young people at those days in Israel. We were on equal, maybe a little, we were a
little bit maybe more dedicated than the influx of Americans, the few Americans that came in
and wanted to be officers running the Army. But they did a great job. They did a great job.
They were in the American Army and they knew more so about armies than we did. That’s true.
Q: Did you speak any English at that time?
A: No, not yet, not yet. No. I spoke a little bit of Italian.
Q: How did you learn Italian.
