Abstract
Katalin Karpati was born in 1912 in Ujpest, Hungary. Her father, Izidor Dicker, was born around
1860 in Budapest. He was the director of a lumber factory in Ujpest. Her mother (maiden name
Schimek) was born in Slovakia around 1860. She was well-educated and helped her husband with his
business. Katalin grew up in a very large, modern house in a gentile neighborhood. The family was not
religious. Katalin married her first husband, Lajos Nagy, on September 12, 1935. He was born in 1898 in
Zagyvapalfalva [Salgotarjan], Hungary. Lajos was a very wealthy businessman. He owned a store and
mines. He received a degree in diplomacy from the University of the East in the late 1920s, but was
unable to find work due to anti-Jewish laws. In 1940, all Jewish men in the village were sent to a labor
camp. He received a medical exemption and was permitted to relocate to a family villa in Ujpest. He
and Katalin lived there from 1942 until 1944. Their first child, Shandor Michael, was born on January 23,
1944. On April 23, 1944, Lajos was taken to forced labor in Felsd6galla, where he died in an air raid. In
May 1944, Katalin and her son were sent to live in the ghetto and then transferred to Auschwitz. Her
six-month old son was killed immediately upon arrival. She was known as Kato Nagy at Auschwitz.
Katalin’s second husband, Joseph Karpati, was born in 1906, one of nine children of Terez Spitz Katz and
Jacob Katz. Jacob was born in Buj, Hungary, around 1860. He had a small general store. He came to the
United States three times before World War | to earn money. Three daughters emigrated and settled in
the New York area. Joseph’s mother, Terez Spitz, was born in Buj, Hungary around 1860. Joseph trained
as a carpenter in Buj and Sarospatak, and moved to Budapest when he was 18. In May 1944, 25
members of the Karpati family were taken from to Buj to Auschwitz and killed. Joseph and his brother
spent four years in forced labor, but survived the war. Two nieces survived, and settled in Israel.
