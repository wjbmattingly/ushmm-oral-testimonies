>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. I'm the host of the museum's public program First Person.
Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First
Person today is Mr. Henry Kahn whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We
are grateful for their sponsorship. I'd like to let you know that Mr. Louis Smith is here with us
today.

[Applause]

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our
First Person guests serve as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue
twice weekly through mid-August.

The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our
upcoming First Person guests. Anyone interested in staying in touch with the Museum and its
programs can complete the Stay Connected card that was in your program today or you can
speak with a museum representative at the back of the room when we're finished in completing
the card you will receive an electronic copy of Henry Kahn's biography so that you can
remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.

Henry will share with us his First Person account as a survivor of the Holocaust with
us for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of the program, we will have an

opportunity for you to ask Henry a few questions. The life stories of Holocaust survivors
transcend the decades. What you are about to hear from Henry is one individual's account of
the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.

Henry Kahn was born Heinz Kahn on January 18, 1923, in Boblingen, Germany. This
photo shows Henry in 1946 prior to his induction in the United States Army. The arrow on this
map points to the town of Boblingen where Henry was born.

Here we see Henry's mother Hedwig and his father Adolph who was a merchant and
fought for Germany in World War |. Later Henry's father became president of a Cattle Dealers'
Association.

November 9 through 10, 1938, the Nazis unleashed a wave of violent attacks on
Jewish-owned businesses and synagogues throughout Germany known as Kristallnacht or the
Night of Broken Glass. Henry's father was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp.
This photo shows a Jewish-owned business destroyed during Kristallnacht. Henry's father
returned home a month later. Shortly after this, Henry left Germany through a Kindertransport,
a rescue effort that brought thousands of Jewish children to Great Britain from Nazi Germany
between 1938 and 1939. Henry arrived in England in February 1939.

When World War II began September 1, 1939, British authorities required Henry to
register as an enemy alien. He was sent by ship to Australia which is highlighted in red on this
map of the world. After just one night in an internment camp there, Henry and 12 other men
were selected to return to England only to end up in Bombay, India. The arrow on this map
points to Bombay.

In 1946, Henry moved to the United States. After the war Henry learned that Nazi
authorities deported his parents to the Lodz ghetto in 1941. They were later murdered. We
close with this photograph of Henry and Doreen Raymond on their wedding day in 1948.
Henry met Doreen in Bombay in 1943.

Just a few months after Henry's arrival in New York in 1946 he was drafted into the
U.S. Army. With the end of the draft he was honorably discharged in the spring of 1947.
Henry's sweetheart from Bombay, Doreen Raymond, arrived in the U.S. June 9, 1948. They
were married 18 days later, June 27, 1948.

After working in the export/import business Henry went into the scrap metal business.
While working full-time and raising a family he enrolled at the City University of New York as
an evening student in 1956. He earned his degree in industrial management in 1966. Doreen
attended Queens College getting a degree as a paralegal and worked as a paralegal in the
Empire State Building. Henry remained in the scrap metal business until his 65th birthday in
1988. He then became a real estate agent. Following a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1992,
Henry retired from his real estate work.

Henry and Doreen raised two sons, Ralph born in 1952, and Roy David born July 1,
1954, 60 years ago this week. Their sons gave them two grandsons and a granddaughter.
And Henry's son Roy is here with Henry today.

There you are right there, Roy.

To be closer to their family, Henry and Doreen moved to Bethesda, Maryland in 2000.
Doreen passed away in 2012. Henry said to me, "We were very much in love right up to the

end."

Henry continues to volunteer at the Montgomery County Thrift Shop where Doreen
and he contributed their time together. Following the loss of Doreen, Henry became involved
with this museum as a volunteer. You will typically find Henry here on Sundays where he has
spent time at the Visitors Desk and is now being interviewed by museum visitors. He also
speaks about his Holocaust experience at local high school and colleges. Henry is fluent in
English and German, walks regularly, spends time in a woodworking shop, tends to his indoor
garden of exotic plants, reads a lot, and spends time with family and friends.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Henry Kahn.

[Applause]
>> Henry Kahn: Thank you.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Henry.

Henry, thank you so much for joining us and for your willingness to be our First Person
today. You have so much to share with us in less than an hour, so we'll start. You were just
10 when Hitler and the Nazis came to power. Before we turn to those years and the war and
the Holocaust, tell us a little about your family and you before the Nazis were in control of
Germany.
>> Henry Kahn: Well, as you heard, | was born in Boblingen, which was about eight miles
southwest of Stuttgart. We lived there, my parents lived there. | was the first son. We were
very friendly with a lot of people and specifically a Mr. Kindler and Mrs. Kindler. They had two
daughters which were my age as well as my brother's age. We played together. The parents,

they went out. They went skiing and played tennis. And also one day | understand, | know,
they went to a masked ball. My father was a Spaniard. My mother was a pompadour. So we
had quite very good relations with everybody.

In 1930, we moved to Stuttgart. | was 7 years old by then. | went to school. The
school | went to was the Waldorf School. The school was a private school, not a public school.
The philosophy was very modern and very democratic. Boys and girls were in the first grade
together, mixed. The boys learned how to knit. The boys and girls learned how to do
woodwork in the third grade. | was very friendly with my classmates. We went out together.
And even when Hitler came, the school didn't -- nobody was different after Hitler came, not in
the school. But you have to remember, it was a private school. So that's already preselected.
>> Bill Benson: Henry, you were at the Waldorf School, | think, one day you were roughed up
by some kids and your parents reported it to your teacher. Tell us about that.
>> Henry Kahn: Well, you know, kidding around. We were knocking around. My clothes were
disheveled, as they say. And my parents complained to Mr. Hager. He was my class teacher.
| like you to remember the name because he comes up later on again. For two hours he
lectured the kids to conduct themselves properly. And if anything further should happen to me,
| should report it immediately to him, which | never -- | had no intentions of ever doing that.
[Laughter]

Which | didn't. But there was no need for it because nothing happened anymore after that.
>> Bill Benson: Will you tell us a little bit about your father? As we mentioned earlier, he
served in the First World War. Do you know much about his service?

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

>> Henry Kahn: Well, he was -- excuse me. He got a draft notice, | believe when he was 19
years old. He lived in a small village with his mother. His father had passed away. And he
had to go to the board. However, his mother hoped he wouldn't be sent too far away. So they
had actually assigned him to the cavalry which would have been in another town. So the
mother -- you know what the officer did? He assigned him to the Navy, which was not only
three years but four years’ service. In the meantime -- that's the attitude. In the meantime, the
war broke out. So he literally -- he was there until the very end. So the war was four years.
My father was in service for seven years. He got a decoration for his services. But that didn't
help in the end.
>> Bill Benson: But he won the Iron Cross. He was a decorated soldier in the German --
>> Henry Kahn: Absolutely. That's what! said basically. Got the Iron Cross, whatever.
>> Bill Benson: Henry, your family suffered a terrible tragedy in 1932 when your brother died
of an infection.
>> Henry Kahn: That's right. He had mastoid infection of the ear. He died of it. Incidentally,
Penicillin had been invented -- or discovered, | should say, in 1927. However, the news didn't
get around fast enough. So my brother couldn't be saved. So that was it.

Now, we were in Stuttgart. My father was the President of a Cattle Dealers’
Association for a few countries. Germany -- like the United States, Germany was split up in
different countries. There was Wuertemberg, Hohenzollern, etc., etc. You go to a geography
lesson and you learn more about tt.

[Laughter]

So he was President of that organization. Then ‘33 came. And the Nazis came into power.
There was an envious member of the association. He, in uniform with some other guys,
walked into my father's office and told him to get out. He threw the keys on the floor and
walked out.

Of course, now he was without a job. You couldn't do anything about it because the
Nazis were in power. However, my father was under the impression that since he had the Iron
Cross and all of that and had served Germany before that nothing much more could happen to
him. Well, unfortunately he was dead wrong; dead wrong.

My father went to Palestine at that time, after a couple of months, to find out whether
i's possible to live there. When he came back, he said, well, if you live there the way we have
to live over there, we'll last a long time. Here, too, he was wrong.

My mother wanted to emigrate almost immediately. In order to do that, she prepared,
learning how to sew ties, make candies and shirts. All of that she learned in order to be able to
do something. We all had planned to come to the United States.

So after my father had returned he had to do something. In the meantime, | went to
school, of course. In 1935 we moved to Cologne. The reason we moved there is because my
father was able to take over a plywood company. My mother was very much opposed, but the
attitude at that time was, between husband and wife, that the husband does and you have to
do whatever he does.

[Laughter]
It wasn't women's lib at that time.

Unfortunately | wish she would have succeeded. Well, that was ‘35. In ‘35, the
Nuremberg Laws came into effect. The Nuremberg Laws, they forbade Jews to mix with
non-Jews so much so that if a person -- we had a woman who worked in our home. And if a
person was below -- a Christian person, if he was below the age of 40, was by law ordered to
leave. Below 40 and over 40, | guess people know what I'm talking about. So we weren't
allowed to go to the swimming pool, to movies. It was rather restricted. And gradually the pain
of fear started to permeate me and other people, too. Well, that was ‘35.

| went to a Jewish school. In 1938, Jewish children in Germany, at that time, had to
leave all public schools. They couldn't go there anymore.
>> Bill Benson: Before you turn to more about ‘38, you had mentioned your mother made all
kinds of preparations.
>> Henry Kahn: | mentioned that.
>> Bill Benson: | was going to add one other one. One of the things in preparing, she wanted
you learn how to blow glass.
>> Henry Kahn: Oh, yes. Where we lived in Cologne, a superintendent taught me how to
blow glass. That, too, came in very handy in later years. I'll come to that.

The next thing, November, ‘39 -- the 9th of November, 9 to 10 of November ‘39,
Kristallnacht. Kristallnacht was the legal riots in Germany where the Nazis went wild. It was
terrible. That's all | can say.

However, on the morning of the 10th, a friend of mine came. In our street, | couldn't
see anything. But the friend came and told me, "Don't go to school today because there's too

much trouble over there." Our synagogue was not burned because it was adjacent to other
buildings. So what they did, they ransacked it. The school was next door to it also. So
consequently | didn't go to school either.

The next day my father was arrested and taken to the police station. Two people in
civilian clothes came and picked him up. On the way to the police station my father asked
what would he have done if he hadn't been home. They said, “Well, we would have gone to
your neighbor who's also Jewish in order to fulfill our quota.” So, in other words, there was no
reason to arrest anybody in particular for any specific reason as long as they were Jewish;
they had to fill their quota.

My mother went to the Gestapo, the secret state police. [Speaking in German]

They told -- she asked my father to be released. They told her that he'll come home.
However, he didn't come home. So she had to go there again. As it turned out, there was
another man there of the name of my father. They had mixed them up. Evidently something
like this happened to me, too, later on.

After he came home, shortly thereafter, we received a surprise telegram from my
cousin in England saying dates. The reason was in order to see whether I'm qualified to get on
the Kindertransport. The British government had passed a law which would allow up to 10,000
children unaccompanied, below the age of 17, to come to England provided they had
sponsors. Well, my cousin was able to get a sponsor for me. He was friendly with a girl
whose father was part owner of a clothing factory and they were willing to take me.

On the 2nd of February 1939, my parents and | went to the railroad station.

>> Bill Benson: Henry, may | stop for a minute? Before you tell us about going to England, tell
us about your father being released from Dachau. He eventually came home from Dachau,
right?
>> Henry Kahn: | mentioned it, | think.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what he said when he came home. He came home after about a
month.
>> Henry Kahn: He said, “If | ever | get into the concentration camp, | will not come out alive.”
He was correct.

So now on the 2nd of February 1939, my parents took me to the railroad station. |
said goodbye to them through the window. And | knew within me positively I'm going to meet
them again. | was so sure. My parents left the platform. Four or five minutes later they came
back because they had found out that the train had been delayed. The moment | saw them it
hit me like this. This is the one which | was sure | was going to see again but | never saw them
again.

The train -- | mentioned before the fear which constantly stayed in us, probably a lot of
people. Cologne is pretty close to the Dutch border. Once we crossed the Dutch border there
was a little girl in the compartment, in the railroad car. She had an illustrated paper with her.
There was a picture of Hitler. She made sure that the Dutch people were coming in and we
were not in Germany anymore. She took this picture of Hitler and tore it into a thousand
pieces. So you can imagine how relieved we all were that we were out of Germany by then.

Well, we crossed the Channel. We got into Liverpool Station in London. | knew a

little -- you see, in the Waldorf School, not only did you know how to knit and sew, we also had
English and German in the first grade. So not that we learned a lot, but we got the sound of it.
And that was excellent. So | had a little knowledge of English. And, of course, in Cologne, |
went to a Jewish school, as | mentioned before, and there we, too, had English and French.
We were in this big room. Everybody had a tag for identification. | thought | was going to help
somebody. There was a lady coming, after quite a while a lady coming in a nice leopard coat.
| decided I'll ask her | could help her. So | walked up to her and | said, "May | help you?” And
she said -- she took out a piece of paper and wrote “Heinz Kahn.” That was --
>> Bill Benson: That was you.
>> Henry Kahn: That was my sponsor. Well, my cousin came pretty shortly thereafter. He
drove the car. | got promptly lost in the London fog. It was very foggy that day. Eventually we
arrived in the house. We had a good dinner. And the first thing | had to learn was how to eat
the English way. Now what is the English way? Peas, the green little peas. You can't eat
them like this. You can't take a spoon. You have to take a fork, turn it upside down, and plant
it. Well, it's kind of difficult. You get two, three, four and you ate it. That | had to learn first.

[Laughter]

Well, she was very particular about that. We lived in a very beautiful home, one-family
home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. The first thing Mr. London asked me was do you want to
go to school or do you want to work. Well, | gave it some consideration. However, | decided |
would like to go to work. There were two reasons for that: number one, | had no money
whatsoever; and, number two, | wanted to get to the United States. And in order to get there |

would have had to have some sort of a trade. | knew nothing. | went to school, sure. So |
decided I'd like to go to work.

So Mr. London was the part owner of a clothing factory, as | mentioned before. He got
me a working permit. | guess you needed that, which was for an apprentice. Now, in England,
at that time, things were very strict. Everything had to be just so. Apprentices got one pound a
week, period. So! was getting a pound a week. | told Mr. London, “Look, | live with you. You
don't have to give me that much money.” "Oh, that's ok." All right.

The first thing | did is learn how to make knots in the packing room and how to put on
tags on pants, what they are, the names, brand names, whatever. Well, | did this for a while,
but | didn't really learn anything. Making knots, you can't get anything with that. So | asked let
me go into the sewing room. Well, it wasn't appropriate, | guess, for somebody who lives with
the boss to work with these common people who work in the sewing room. Well, there was
nothing. | couldn't do a thing.

So | lived there for a while. They were very nice. He told me to work. And he drove
me home. At lunchtime | had lunch with them. At dinnertime, | had dinner with the family. As
wonderful as it was, it was basically a glorified prison because | couldn't do anything. | had no
money to go anyplace. And even if | did, | wouldn't know how to go about it. There was no
public transportation or anything like this in that area.
>> Bill Benson: Henry, tell us about changing your name, why you changed your name.
>> Henry Kahn: Oh, yes. [Laughter] Mrs. London said, well, you can't be called Heinz.
Choose a name. So | figured | don't want to have a name with an H because all criminals

change their name. So | didn't want that. Then | wanted to have a name which was English as
well as German. So consequently | chose Peter. At that time | was called Peter then by the
Londons. But my mother -- when | wrote to my mother about it, she was quite upset because
she didn't like me calling myself Peter but if Mrs. London liked it that way, that's ok.
>> Bill Benson: As you just said, you were at this time still able to communicate with your
parents.
>> Henry Kahn: Yes. There was no war yet. We wrote to each other, of course.

Well, time went on. There was ‘39. It didn't take very long. In September,
September 1, 1939, in spite of the fact that Hitler had made a promise to Mr. Chamberlain that
he had no further ambitions to expand Germany, he broke that word. Of course he broke more
words. He broke the word when he marched into Russia also.

Anyway, since England had a pact with Poland -- on the 3rd of September 1939
Mr. Chamberlain declared war on Germany. Of course, then all communication was shut off.
Almost immediately the alarms went off. But it was a false alarm but it gave you a nice shock
listening after the war had been declared, | can assure you.

By the way, when | went on the train, | was two weeks after my 16th birthday. If
anybody here is 15 or 16 years old -- nobody? Oh, yeah, there are some. Ok. Well, you can
feel -- you can think about it and think leaving your parents and not seeing them again how
that feels or the parents that you're going to lose your child forever. This is a very, very sad
experience.
>> Bill Benson: Somewhat along those lines, Henry, after war broke out, soon after that

Mr. London told you that you were going to have to go out on your own.
>> Henry Kahn: | was coming to that.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Henry Kahn: | was coming to that. After the war broke out, Mr. London told me, well,
they're going to be evacuating. We meaning Mrs. London, their daughter, and himself.
They're going to evacuate. And | have to look for a place to stay. Well, in a way | was glad
about this because | was out of the glorified prison.

Well, | looked around and | found a place in Finsbury Park. There's one also in
Leisure World, a place called Finsbury Park Lane. Anyway. Then | asked Mr. London to give
me more money. But he said, “No, | can't. You get one pound.” Well, with one pound you
can't do very much. | had to pay for my lodging and | had to take care of myself. So that |
didn't like very much. But now | asked him again to let me work on the machine or let me learn
how to sew. And this time he couldn't refuse me because | was on my own. And soon after |
did that, | was good enough to go into piece work. And piece work allowed me to make more
than one pound.

In addition which they asked -- you see, at that time it was difficult to get ahold of
sewing needles. And some of those women, they liked the idea of breaking a needle and
asking for another one. And some of them didn't break the needle and ask for another one.
So | was asked to take charge of the sewing needles. And | said, now, look, it's my time. I'm
working on piece work. So | got another Sixpence which is half a shilling a day. So it came
out to 30 shillings, which is 50% more than what | had before which was good. And | saved as

| got along fine with everybody. Not much happened till the first few months. Ona
holiday in England, it's also in the United States but very few people are aware of it, we had a
three-day weekend. | decided to go for a bicycle ride to Oxford. Well, the Oxford excursion --
a friend of mine was supposed to come with me, but just before that time Germany invaded
Holland, Belgium, and eventually France. And things got pretty critical over there, but |
decided to go anyway.

So | drove to Oxford. And in Oxford, everything was dead. There was nothing, which
was rather disappointing. | found a place to stay. It was a private home. And in the morning |
overheard the radio say all foreigners should report to the police station immediately. Well, |
said to the landlady, “Where's the police station?” She said, “Why do you want to know that?”
And | said, well, | thought -- they said, “I thought you were Irish.” But | wasn't. | was from
Germany originally. So | went to the police station. They told me go back and stay there.
That's all. Leave things alone. Take it easy.

Well, | drove back. And then, of course, the British Expeditionary Force, which had
been sent to France, had become surrounded in Dunkirk, which is to the south -- the north of
France, near the English Channel. They were surrounded. They had to be evacuated. And
many, many private boats, they went across the channel to take the British soldiers, as well as
French soldiers, back to England. They saved about 300,000 people that they wouldn't be
taken prisoners by the Germans.

Well, England became panicky now, literally panicky. They decided to intern

everybody who came from Germany originally. The fact that | was a refugee from Nazi
oppression had no baring whatsoever anymore.
>> Bill Benson: In fact, you had a certificate that said you were exempted from internment and
it didn't matter.
>> Henry Kahn: No, no. That's not correct.
>> Bill Benson: Ok. All right. So you were considered a refugee from Nazi oppression.
>> Henry Kahn: That was my designation. Correct.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Henry Kahn: Gradually -- this was June. Gradually | noticed that some of my
acquaintances were interned. Realizing that, | decided | would ask for a certificate from the
company, from London Brothers, where | worked, and also took all my money which | had
saved to the Bloomsbury House. The Bloomsbury House was that organization which was
responsible for the kids who came on the Kindertransport. And when | got to that office, this
lady, | told her, look -- when | get interned, get me out as fast as possible. And after that get
me a chance to get to the United States. Well, she said the money isn't quite enough but we'll
make up the difference. Fine.

Excuse me.
| hadn't gotten my certificate yet, but | insisted on it. | said, “No, | want it today.” Sure
enough when | got home the lady told me tomorrow report to the police station, take all of your
stuff along. Ok. | did. | was properly interned. That was July 3.

>> Henry Kahn: 1940. So it's an important day for me. | was interned then.
>> Bill Benson: 74 years ago today.
>> Henry Kahn: 74 years ago today. We were taken to a race course where we stayed for the
night. Then we were given a big piece of cheese, put on a train, and taken to Liverpool.
Liverpool is a port city on the west coast of England. It was raining cats and dogs. The tents,
they were partially collapsed because they hadn't been put up properly. And from the air it
looked like an Army tent, of course. Of course there was barbed wire around it to make sure
we knew where we are.

Then we were told that Liverpool had been bombed the week before and a ship which
had taken prisoners of war and internees to Canada had been torpedoed and sunk and many,
many lives were lost. Well, now we were asked who wants to be interned in an overseas
dominion. Dominion? What is a dominion? Well, | found out in due course.

The question was -- do | answer yes or no? Do! want to be interned? Do | not want
to be interned? | mean sent overseas. | decided to take a chance and be torpedoed rather
than take a chance and stay in England and God knows what's going to happen. First of all,
they may strafe us as an Army camp. And then the Nazis would, God forbid, come and take
over.

Seven days after | was interned we were taken aboard a ship, the HMT Dunera, which
was 73,000 pounds -- 73,000 tons, big enough for 1,500 people. However, we were 2,500

night we slept any which way.
>> Bill Benson: In addition to fellow internees, others that were in the same boat as you, so to
speak, there were also prisoners of war.
>> Henry Kahn: | mentioned that, didn't I?
>> Bill Benson: | don't know if you did. Can you say it again?
>> Henry Kahn: Prisoners of war which were kept separate by a stupid little tent.
>> Bill Benson: So just on the other side of this fence from you.
>> Henry Kahn: Sure.

So the very same night, the 10th of July, the ship pitched and rolled like crazy. |
couldn't see anything outside, but | was surprised because there was no storm. However, it
pitched and rolled because it zigzagged like crazy. And sure enough a torpedo was shot at us,
hit the ship but did not explode. It made a dent in the ship, though.

We drove north, rode north, and went west towards Canada. Of course, the prisoners
of war were mostly Navy people. They knew all about it. Through the grape vines we got to
know what was going on. They said, well, we're going to Canada. And then said no, we're
going south. Went south all the way down, around the Cape of Good Hope, and then east all
the way to Australia. It took two months to get there.
>> Bill Benson: | want you to tell us something else before you talk about getting to Australia.
Tell us what the crew or the guards were like on the ship and what happened to the luggage
and why that was significant.

>> Henry Kahn: All right. Well, as | mentioned before, the luggage which we had was put on a
big pile and a canvas was put over it. Every day when the weather was all right, we were told
to run around the deck. There was a machine gun on one side and on the other side so that
we wouldn't do any harm. And there we saw that the canvas had been taken off and the
luggage was being opened. The crew which came along to guard us of course was not the
cream of the crop from the British Army. They were really the scum of it. Some of them had
glass eyes. There were drunkards in one instance. One of those guys was so drunk that he
had to be taken to the infirmary. And one of the internees picked up his gun and carried it for
him. So you can imagine what the situation was.

Incidentally, the officer in charge eventually became court martialed. But that was way
after the war.
>> Bill Benson: And as they rifled through the belongings --
>> Henry Kahn: | know, | know. I'm coming to it.
>> Bill Benson: I'm worried about running out of time. | know you want to tell us this.
>> Henry Kahn: | know. | will.

They went through that stuff. | didn't see where we were running around. But | did --
the stink was getting pretty awful in the deck; in all the decks, by the way. So | got a couple of
guys together, the youngsters. We had buckets of water and mops. And we chased after the
people on one side. We cleaned the deck. And then we cleaned the rest of the deck. That
was considerably better then after that.

So to give us a deal, we were allowed to come on deck when other people were not

allowed to come on deck and stay out there. And while we were out there, we noticed that the
soldiers were throwing things overboard like crazy. | mean left and right. They opened up the
suitcases. If you had a name on one of your clothes, then you got something back which we
got eventually. Taking them from one deck to the other, all the items that were left over. But
how can you identify bed sheets or cans of soup or anything like that? You can't. So they
threw it all overboard. Maybe some bologna.

However, as bad as that conduct was, and it was criminal, believe it or not it probably
saved our lives. And the way that happened, because there was another U-Boat which came
later. The captain was curious what they were throwing overboard. There were
German-written letters. And | found that out many years later when | was in Stuttgart.
>> Bill Benson: And possibly among those letters that were thrown overboard was the letters
from your parents that you lost. Right?
>> Henry Kahn: Well, everything got lost. That's all right. How quirky things were sometimes,
| can tell you. So there were two instances where we were lucky.
>> Bill Benson: You eventually did make it to Australia.
>> Henry Kahn: Well, the ship made it to Australia, yeah.

[Laughter]

In Sydney we didn't have much to eat. And the tea was terrible. As it turned out, they
put some stuff in the tea to reduce our -- how shall | say -- our drives.

[Laughter]
Yeah. That's a fact.

All right. So we were in it Australia. The Australian soldiers, they were a different
breed altogether. They were wonderful. We got sandwiches. We were taken off the ship. We
were taken aboard a train. We rode 18 hours into the interior. | watched from the window how
a kangaroo was jumping along trying to race the train, but, of course, there was no contest.
We arrived in the camp which was brand new. It was beautiful. It was very windy. And the
sand was blasting against our legs. | felt like being sandblasted, believe it or not. The camp
was there. | guess we had something to eat. | don't remember now. We went to sleep.

The next morning, 13 names were called out and mine was first one on the list. Come
back to the orderly room. Well, we went there. We were told get your stuff. One of them
overheard one of the soldiers say, "These chaps are going back to England." Well, | wasn't
asked. | was told to go back, get my luggage what little | had. | had nothing anymore. | had a
sugar bag | put some stuff in which | got and some stuff which | got -- | got toothbrush and
toothpaste in Sydney. They gave it to us.

So we went back to the train station, were taken back to Sydney, back on the ship, put
in the bunker, locked up. Well, | got scared stiff there. That's the first time | really got scared.
| mean physically scared. We got something to eat. Then we were taken out and taken to the
prison to a prison in Sydney. This was a compound of five different buildings. And one of
them was designated an internment camp.

There we met an Italian who was interned from Australia. He got newspapers. We
saw in the newspaper that London was in flames, especially the lower east end where | used
to work. It wasn't very appetizing to think we were going back there.

>> Bill Benson: Henry, tell us, if you can, why you 13 fellows were selected to return to
England.
>> Henry Kahn: Well, you remember | said | was going to the Bloomsbury House and gave
them my papers. It so happened -- and | found out much, much later -- that my release came
through the day | went aboard the ship, on the 10th. It was only seven days between the day |
was interned and the day we went aboard the ship. So then you didn't have e-mails or
anything like that. It took longer to get the message through. So consequently | was released.
| guess the others, | don't know. It must be similar.
>> Bill Benson: So from Australia you eventually end back up on the ship and you set sail for
England.
>> Henry Kahn: No.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Henry Kahn: | said we were told. We were told that these chaps are going back to
England.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Henry Kahn: Ok. So now we were in that prison. We found out that London was in flames.
After having been in Australia for 10 days, again 10 days, we went back to the ship which was
now ready to sail again. Back to the Dunera. We landed in Perth, the west coast of Australia.
We helped them load pigs, half pigs, cut in half, frozen, of course, which was provisioned for
people. And then we went east for another two weeks. The ship docked. We were taken off
the ship. And | saw that the people around were dark skinned. There was lots of red dots on

the street. And we were taken to the police station. The police, they interviewed each one of
us. The one who interviewed me asked me all sorts of silly questions. Then he said, “Where
do live?” | said, “| don't even know where | am and you ask me where you live?” So it turned
out to be the Jewish Relief Association. Of course they got papers, British government,
whoever. | don't know. | didn't pay for it.
>> Bill Benson: This is now Bombay, India. Right?
>> Henry Kahn: Well, | was coming up --
>> Bill Benson: Ok. You're in Bombay, India now. Ok.
>> Henry Kahn: So, that was Bombay, India, right. You're stealing the thunder from me, you
know.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
>> Bill Benson: So now you're in Bombay.
>> Henry Kahn: Right. Now I'm in Bombay. The Jewish Relief Association was an
association. And the home was sponsored by them. On the board there was a gentleman.
He invited the 13 of us, first six and then seven, to come to dinner because he wanted to -- |
mean, big piles of rice and all sorts of stuff. He was very nice. He selected the youngsters
whom he liked. And he invited them more often. And | asked him, “Eventually, I'd like to learn
something. Maybe you know someplace.” So he said, yes, you can go to a dental lab. He
arranged for me to have a job as a dental lab. And while | was there, | used the skill which |
had learned blowing glass by making -- these are the teeth you put into your mouth and

select -- eject the saliva while the dentist is drilling your teeth. Well, | made those. But there
was no market for it earlier. Sold a few, but it really wasn't worth it.

So after a while | only got very little money. Not even enough to pay for the fair going
and coming to work. So consequently | told the boss, “Look, | can't afford to work for you any
longer. Sorry.” So the next thing | got was a job -- while | was -- | forgot that. While | was
living in Finsbury Park, at night | went to school, learned bookkeeping. In this class there were
all sorts of youngsters from offices. | was working in a factory. So they knew terms which |
had no idea what they were. So | had to learn a lot. However, | did learn some bookkeeping.
That helped.

So now | was back in India. And the next job | got was a bookkeeper in a company.
There | kept the books. Before | did this, | went to a bookstore, bought myself a book on
bookkeeping and started it quickly. | went over it. And | did the job, believe it or not.

Next thing, after a while, | got more money than | had first but | didn't have enough to
get out of the home, which | wanted. | eventually got a job with the Indian Tool Company as a
night shift supervisor. Supervisor, mind you, 17-year-old -- 18-year-old supervisor.

[Laughter]

There were lots of -- about 10, 12 people were working night shift. At that time,
national spirit went very high. You saw signs all over the place, "Quit India," "Quit India." One
of the days a guy said, “You know, we had a lot of fun at the railroad station on the way up
there -- he said to me, “We had a lot of fun. We burned ties and topies.” The hats. And the
ties, a symbol of the British. He burned them on the station. So | got scared wondering when

am | going to be the fun. So | decided | would get myself a piece of rubber, piece of lead at the
bottom, tie it up, and put it into my pocket. So | felt a little safer.
>> Bill Benson: Our time is running short.
>> Henry Kahn: Yeah, | know.
>> Bill Benson: If you don't mind, there's a couple of things | would like you to share with us
before we do that. Tell us about meeting your future wife. And then tell us about how you
came to the United States.
>> Henry Kahn: Yes, yes, yes. Well, first, | was [inaudible] for 3/4 of the year, then | came
back. A friend of mine told me to go to the Maccabi Sports Club. There we played ping-pong.
There was a young girl who played very well; in fact, so well she beat me almost all the time.
So consequently | took revenge, eventually married her. But that was much later.

[Laughter]

The trouble was, though, we fell in love, believe it or not. She wanted to leave India,
too, as | did. In 1946, before we left, we made a conditional engagement if and when we meet
again and feel the same way about each other as we do now, we'll get married.

The only trouble was | went to the United States then. It's a big story, but | got in the
Army. | got out of the Army. That was the draft law at that time. She was born in India. But
there was no quota for people who were born in India, so | had to try and get her over
somehow. While | was in uniform, | went to the State Department. And the State Department |
spoke to somebody. | wasn't married. | had nothing. | wasn't even married to her. So | said
to them -- well, in the Army, you do things. If you can't do them officially, you can do them

anyway.
[Laughter]
So | asked over there maybe something can be done to get her over.

So one day my future wife at the time worked across the street from the American
Consulate. She got a call one day can you come over, come during lunchtime. She went
over. She was asked, “Do you want to still go to the United States?” She said yes. Ok. So
the next day they called again, “When do you want to go?” So she had to give notice first and
all of that. So finally, on June 9, 1948, she came. And on the 27th we got married.
>> Bill Benson: Before we close and before you close | want to ask you one other question.
But before | do, | think, if I'm correct, you and your wife, before you were married, before she
came to the United States, exchanged 117 letters. Right?
>> Henry Kahn: We exchanged 117 letters. She wrote 117. And | did.
>> Bill Benson: Because in your memoir, number 117 is the last one she wrote from India
before she came.
>> Henry Kahn: That's right.
>> Bill Benson: One last question before you finish. Tell us, when did you learn what
happened to your parents?
>> Henry Kahn: Well, | learned it after | was in the United States, after the war. | don't know.
It must have gotten through. | don't remember where | got it from. But my parents were killed.
They were sent to Lodz, a concentration camp of some kind. My father died in the hospital
there. He probably was neglected. And my mother was probably killed, murdered, shot on the

way back when the Germans had to withdraw when the Russians came.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn back to Henry in just a moment to close our program. | want
to thank all of you for being here very much, remind that you we'll have First Person programs
each Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. So | hope you can return and join
us another time. And if not, look to the website for information about our program in 2015.

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So Henry is
going to close up the program in just a moment. Two comments. Because we didn't have a
chance for questions and answers with you, the audience, Henry, will you stay afterwards a
few minutes if anybody wants to ask you a question?
>> Henry Kahn: I'll stay as long as you ask questions.
>> Bill Benson: If you want to just shake his hand, Henry will step off the stage over here.
Absolutely feel free to do that. And when Henry's done, Joel, our photographer, will come up
on the stage. I'm going to ask you all to stand. He's going to take a photograph of Henry with
you in the background. It just makes for a lovely photograph. So we'll do in a moment.

Henry?
>> Henry Kahn: Ok. First of all, | mentioned Mr. Hager, my classroom teacher. In 1962 | met
him again in New York, not accidentally but | met him there. He told me in ‘38 they had to --
they dismissed all the students in the Waldorf School, all the teachers in the Waldorf School.
And he told me he worked in a torpedo factory and once in a while he put sand into the
mechanism. And | asked him why did take such a chance. And his answer was, “I! wanted to
play a trick on the Nazis.” So all you know, I'm here because of him.

lf you Know someone whom you dislike, in fact really, deeply hate for good reasons,
try hard not to generalize. Do not assume that all members of his or her ethnic or national
background are the same or have the same tendencies. Please remember a baby knows love
but to hate has to be learned or taught. Don't let unjustified hate blind you to reality.

After 64 years of married life, Doreen passed away. The funeral director showed us a
sample of the plaque which you put on the graves. And my son -- we saw samples of items
depicting the passing of the particular person, like an airplane or a boat. And my son
suggested that a piano -- since my wife liked music very much, that a piano would be
appropriate. So we decided to put a piano on her side of the plaque. Now, | am a jack of all
trades but a master of none. | had to wonder what can | do. Well, then it occurred to me that |
was very fortunate. And the first time | went for a walk with my future wife, at that time
girlfriend, we were on the beach. And suddenly she saw a shooting star. She got all excited
about it. That's when | gave her my first kiss. So then it occurred to me, since | was very
lucky, I'm going to take a shooting star and have this as a symbol on my plaque. That's what's
happening.

That's the end.

[Applause]
