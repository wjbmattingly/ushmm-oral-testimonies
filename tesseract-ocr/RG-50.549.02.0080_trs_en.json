We f -- I remember that when the Russians arrived, they assigned most of the partisans to the army, because the war was still going on. And I and another group and one of the commandeers were assigned to liberate my town and the vicinity of Pruzana. So ra  time when I -- when I came to Pruzana, the most assignments what we were given was to first of all, to s -- look and find most all the collaborators who collaborated with the Germans. This was one of our mission, and then we were sent surrounding towns around Pruzana. I recall one place, it was near -- not far -- 50 kilometers from Pruzana. We went in a little town, I think it was -- let me [indecipherable] the town. Think it was Bielsk, Bielsk. And I remember a farmer came over to me, and he was telling me there is -- this farmer was eding -- hiding out one of the Jewish -- a Jew - a Jewish boy. And the farmer told me, he says, I been trying to tell him that the war is Over, come out from there. He was in the barn, in a hay barn they\u2019re hiding. And he -- he\u2019s heard -- he didn\u2019t believe him because it was still going on, a lot of bombardments, the Russians, you know, the airplanes, they bombard at the retreating German army. So I remember I went out to him and I says, come out, I\u2019m a Jew, and I spoke to him Yiddish. Finally he came out. Of course, he was all unshaved, dirty and oof -- this 1s -- this is occasion that I can never forget. Then, while being -- eventually, when I settled in Pruzana, I came to my house and the house, a lot of houses were destroyed during the war. My house was still existing there. And I came to my house and there was a family with a lot of children, awful This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And she tried to, you know, give me food and I saw they haven\u2019t got much for themselves, they were -- I just asked her a place to stay and sleep because I was still working, I was still in my uniform, was still given a job to look for all those collaborators. And eventually the  another historish -- historic movement -- mo-moment, I would say, after a -- a few weeks or a couple mo -- maybe -- maybe six weeks, showed up in sh -- in Pruzana a doctor, her name is Olla Goldfine, and she was a neighbor of mine. And before the war, you know, I was in y -- you know, listening to these -- to these history what is going on with the Germans, with the Nazis in Germany, and so what I\u2019m [indecipherable] I was only 15 years old that time, I was surprised and she told me - and she came with a nun, and she told me that she escaped on the second -- this was January the -- I -- I think it was the second transport, January the 28\", 1943, at night from the -- from the cattle car, and she -- sh -- wandered around all night til she reached -- in Pruzana we had nuns -- what is the name?

Of course, I tried, you know, I was able to do a lot of things that time when I was as-assigned to -- in Pruzana. I helped them very much, and eventually, when I left Pruzana, the nun and the doctor followed me and I brought them out to Poland. The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in Bialystok because Bialystok was already liberated, and Bialystok was assigned the temporary capital of Poland. Coming in Bialystok there were already lot of organizations, like different organization from different -- from different nationalities, from churches, some from -- and they helped, you know, that time to find housing and to settle down temporarily.
