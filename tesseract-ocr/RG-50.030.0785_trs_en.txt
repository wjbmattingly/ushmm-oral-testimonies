Q: It would have been southeast.
A: Southeast of Warsaw.
Q: Okay. So was it in the eastern part of Poland, even though it was in the middle?
A: No, as I say, in the central part of Poland. But then, in 1932, my family moved
to eastern Poland, which was [indecipherable]. The district was Tarnopol.
Q: Tarnopol, okay, okay.
A: This is the eastern part, which was then overrun by Russians.
Q: Okay. We’ll come to that, thank you. Let’s stay with Krulewiec(ph). Since you
moved in 1932, you were only a young boy then, but do you have any memories of
this — of Krulewiec(ph) at all?
A: Yes, I have pretty good memories. It was a fairly well organized village, very
new, as a matter of fact. And it was close to a village of importance, was Wola
Zarczycka.
Q: Wola Zarezycka?
A: Yes.
Q: And why was that village important?
A: Because all the homes were pretty new. It was a new village, and — and as I re —
as I remember, houses were pretty nice for that period of time. Lot of them were
brick, with large lots. Will — buildings were quite new.

there was a forest nearby. So th-th — in timber.

A: Yes, it was ver — fairly new. And it had other buildings, like the — for — for the
animals, for — farm animals were kept in there, and also the one where they kept
grain.
Q: So you had a barn, and a stable. You had a barn for —
A: Yeah, there was a stable, and as a matter of fact, the stable was a brick building.
Q: That’s pretty unusual.
A: Yeah, it’s pretty — a-and I remember there were special facilities for — for the
animals, where everything was run down, and I mean, it was pretty clean —
Q: Oh, you mean when the — where you could wash down the dirt from the
animals?
A: Yes, yeah, th-the —
Q: Okay.
A: Yes, it was concrete floor. And of course, there was also this — a lot of straw on
it, but —
Q: What color —
A: — underneath there was a concrete floor, and with gutters, so you could wash out
— wash the area where the animals were living. And of course, you know, th-there
was a different — the separate par — place for horses, also. Because we had cows,
and horses.

Q: Did you have any other animals besides cows and horses?

Q: The king.
A: — very, very good, very intelligent dog.
Q: Yeah. Did your father build this place too, since he was a builder?
A: No, it was already there, because when — when — when they — when he left his
village — when he was born, he moved into this — it was called a colony really, you
know. Like the —
Q: It was a colony.
A: Colony. Kolonia, in Polish. But it was a straight street, very straight street, and
houses on both sides of — of the street. And there was a church, there was a
blacksmith there, who was very busy all the time. I — I spent some time watching
how they were putting shoes on the horses. So, it was interesting to watch.

A: And then there were — there was — well, there were — I — I — a carpenter. There
was a big place where the owner was the carpenter, he built furniture and all — all
sorts of things. So that — that it’s — that’s about all I can recollect.
Q: Well, that’s a lot. That’s a lot. Did —
A: Yes, and I remember there was a pond at — at the end of this colony. I spend
some times cat-catching the frogs in that pond.
Q: Did your family have land near the house? You kept — you kept farm animals,
you kept cows and horses.
A: Yes.
Q: And what were they used for? The cows, I can imagine, for milk.
A: Well, the horses were used to toi — to work on the farm.
Q: So, in other words, you lived on a farm —
A: On — on a farm — no, the farm was attached, or the house was built on a farm,
because every owner had a lot behind the house, let’s say, you know, a lot of area,
where they would raise grain, and — and cabbage and potatoes.
Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it’s — it is in some ways
unusual for people to — 1t doesn’t sound like you lived in the middle of an
agricultural place, insofar as you had a street, you had both houses on the side of the

street, and — and it | — sounds almost like a small residential area, but not a place
that’s a farm area. And — and —
A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German
extraction.
Q: Oh, really?
A: Yes, so it — it — it was even referred like a German colony.
Q: Really?
A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in
there, so the buildings I can recollect, were brick buildings, and pretty substantial,
let’s say, you know, there’s — they not dilapidated or anything like that, it was — I
think it was a fairly new colony.
Q: Okay. Let’s turn now a little bit to your family. Did you have brothers and
sisters?
A: Yes, there were four of us, and two sisters.

January 24, 2015
A: M-Most of people probably came from different areas, from around the villages,
because I think it was a fairly new settlement, let’s say, like outside of this larger
village, Wola Zarezycka.
Q: I see.
A: But it — it had — it’s na— own name, Krulewiec(ph), but right now, when I look
at the maps and everything, kr — kr — it’s just Wola Zarezycka.

hometown?

probably about 10,000 inhabitants. And it was known because there was a castle,
owned by a — the Pototskis(ph) family, which 1-in Polish history, Pototskis(ph) are

January 24, 2015
A: But, I am talking about the early life, because in 1932, my father bought some
land in the eastern part of Poland, because there were huge far — farms, owned by
counts — hrabias, in Polish, and they were dividing the land for purchase, and a lot
of people then purchased this — this land. So we moved from that original area, into
the eastern part of Poland.
Q: Okay. I’m going —
A: And that’s where my — most of my youth — of course, that wasn’t long, because
from ’32 to 1940, when we were deported to Russia, it’s what, only —
Q: Eight years.
A: — eight years.
Q: Yeah.
A: But that’s where I spent my you — youth.
Q: Right. Where — so, how mu —
A: Up to the age of 13.
Q: Okay. We’ll come to that. Now, I just want to do a bit of comparison. Your
father owned the land in Krulewiec(ph)? Did he own it?
A: He owned the land, and buildings, and yes.

A: Which was right by our house, in the back of the — the lots were very wide —
Q: Yeah.
A: — you know, by —
Q: Well, he — four hectares is — it’s maybe small for a farm, but it’s an awful big
area for, you know, a lot of land. You know, for a piece of land.
A: Yes, I think it was just average.
Q: Yeah.
A: F-Four, five hectares.
Q: Could you feed a family from the four or five hectares?
A: Oh yes, yes. So —
Q: So how many hectares did he buy in eastern Poland’?
A: Seven. He — he bought seven hectares, because that — it was called folwark,
which is like a large f-farm owned by count.

A: And they were dividing the land after the war. It was government program —
Q: Land reform.
A: — to — to break up this large —
Q: Estates.
A: — ownerships.
Q: Yeah.
A: So people were — were able to buy — some people who had some contribution in
obtaining the independence of Poland were given land. But my father did not get,
he bought it.
Q: He bought it.
A: He bought it, yes.
Q: But tell — tell me —
A: Because he was a bricklayer, and a builder.
Q: Okay, tell me this. Seven hectares, compared to four is not that much more. I
mean, it is double.
A: Yes.
Q: But he moved his family across Poland —
A: Right.

January 24, 2015
Q: — for that. What was the motivation? Because it was seven hectares, rather than
four?
A: First of all, the — the — the land was much better in the eastern part, because it —
you — you — part of the Ukraine, which was — it was called like the feeding area for
the Europe, for Europe.
Q: Was the breadbasket of Europe.
A: Breadbasket for Europe, and I — I don’t know why he didn’t buy more, but
actually, that was — that was it. But, as I say, his farming was a part-time actually.
Q: Okay.
A: Cause his main income was from —
Q: Construction.
A: — being a builder.
Q: Yeah. So did he — did he build that — was there already a house on that land
when you moved there, or did he build it? What did that place look like?
A: Well, that was another example where the land was being divided because it was
owned by hrabia, which is Count Flossik(ph).
Q: Flossik(ph), mm-hm.
A: Yes, he — he own a huge amount of land, and people were buying a lot —

Q: They needed him.
A: — needed, right. Who wa — whatever they needed, he was there to do it. And yet,
they were very turn — turned — completely turned against us. It’s —I still can’t
understand that, because I think that they — they lived in — peacefully until the very
end when — when the Russians came in. So everybody was friendly and everything
else, helpful. But when the Russians came in, they already put armbands, those
local — local Ukrainians, and they started cooperating, collaborating with the
Russians. But it wasn’t wrong, because the Russians then arrested those people —
Q: Really? Okay.

somewhere nobody knew them.

Q: Tell me what happened.
A: Well, early in the morning, on the 10" of February, I think Saturday, they came
in. It was still dark outside, maybe five o’clock, something like — we all asleep. So
they started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think — I don’t know who
was the first, Father, Mother, got up, went to the door, opened the door, they came
in. There were about five Russian soldiers with guns — no rifles, with rifles and
bayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? Imet’ oruzhiye.
That’s in Russian.
Q: Imet’ oruzhiye?
A: Oruzhiye. Do you have weapons? My father says no, I don’t have any weapon.
Although, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know.
He didn’t even say nothing, because he couldn’t get to it, or even if he could, he
couldn’t do anything, because there’s lo — many of them, these Russian soldiers,
well-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are — you are going
to be taken away from here. And says, you — you do not belong — you do not belong
to here. He says, Father, what? This is my land. No, it’s not yours. We are taking
over. It’s no more — no longer it’s yours, you — you have nothing, just pack up
whatever you can, food and some clothing. Because they came with those vehicles,
Carriages.

Q: Horse-drawn?
A: Horse-drawn carriages, yeah. And they said, here, pack up what you want, or
what you can, take some warm clothing and some food. So — and they were well,
like I say, armed. You had to obey their orders. I mean, Mother was resisting.
Whatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw
off. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha — with them. She — she — she didn’t
— she couldn’t comprehend this, you know, what’s going on. Why — why are you
taking us away? What was — where are we going? We don’t know, but you have to
move. We’ll — we’ll take you away from here. So she was throwing things off. And
the soldiers would put some food, let’s say, food or clothing, or — back on the
vehicle, she would throw it back. They threaten her, if you will continue like this,
we'll shoot you. This is what — what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law
started talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do,
because otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That’s what he said. Now, so
she calmed down, and we put some stuff on the — on these carriages, and then they
drove us away from our home.
Q: How much — how much time had they given you to do this?
A: Oh, it — maybe hour and a half, it was something like that. No — no more than
two hours. We — we — we were on the way. But they took us — this I remember, I’ ll

tell you why, took us to the local school, because there was room, you know, in the
school, classes and everything, there was assembly hall. So they put all these people
together in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out
from the school, went back to our house, which wasn’t far, maybe half a mile. So
when I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and
bacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our
dining room. So, I took the violin. I could have run away somewhere, you know, to
Q: Right.
A: — some neighbors or something like that, but I didn’t. I took the violin, and I
went back to my parents, which were held in that school. But I saw this
[indecipherable] when they already having good time on the food and everything.
So imagine, I — I see — really terrible thing to even imagine how these people felt,
that they had to leave everything behind, for what, why? Why do — why are you
taking, what’s — no compensation, no reason, no nothing. Just —
Q: You were never told — you were never told why you —
A: No, you never told. You — he says, this doesn’t belong to you any more. State is
taking over. State means Russia, Soviet Russia. The state is taking over your —
your possessions and everything, and they forced us out, by taking us to this school.

facilities there, larger. And they put us in a courtroom, large, big hall, where normal
trials were taking place. Now —

They left them there. For no — what was ever reason? They wanted — the father and
mother wanted to —
Q: Be together.

co-coming. So they were gathering this transport, they were arranging a hu — long
transport, maybe of 40 carriages, or something like that, you know? A long
transport. But there were only few from our place, and few from others, and I know
these people because I met them later, in Canada.
Q: On the same transport?

A: In Russia, kipiatok. Which is just boiled water, but you could use it to make
something like tea, or what — or whatever you had to put in it — into it. And
sometimes it was two hours stop, maybe three hours stop, and then everybody
would get back. Of course, it was guarded. There were, every few wagons, or yes,

A: There was no other work available, only timber. Everything was timber. Cutting
wood, cutting to smaller pieces, cleaning it, removing the branches. That’s was —

outside?

new year, the first of January, ’42, my family finally decided to leave Russia.
Q: And why did it take that extra number of months to make this decision?

going to do? Said well, maybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And

two months, by various means, basically freight train. So when they — when we
came to Uzbekistan, Polish authorities, which were already trying to help this
civilian population, say that we are going to move you away from Russia, into
Persia. So, it was a very short period of time, only two weeks when — when my
mother and sister and I was assigned to leave Russia, in March.
Q: Okay.
A: And since we came by the end of February, so only a few weeks. And we were
already, as far as I’m concerned, ready to leave, and I fell sick with typhus. Typhoid
fever. So they couldn’t — they didn’t allow me, because the transport was ready to —
to leave Russia, to Persia, and a— we were assigned to this transport, but because

17.
Q: And you were then about how old?
A: I was 14 years, 15.

A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left Russia early. And my mother
and sister also left in March, while I stayed behind until August.
Q: Oh, that’s quite a while then.
A: Yes, quite a while, because then they stopped the transpor — transports. I don’t
know whose decision it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march —
exodus I call it, let’s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left Russia. But in
August they resumed leaving —
Q: I see.
A: — because General Anders was then in charge of the army and everybody that
was there, and he negotiated with the Russian people, with the Russian authorities.
So, in August they resumed, and they moved about hundred thousand people at that
time.
Q: Huge number.
A: Huge number, but it was all concentrated. August — and mainly August, yeah, a
lot of people left.
Q: And —
A: And then when — I also left Russia.

Q: Also left at the same time?
A: — yes, right, yes.
Q: So let’s go back now, and talk about what happened to your father. The last you
mentioned is he rebuilt this beautiful house.
A: Yes, for the administrator there, the main them —
Q: Right.
A: — boss of that area. And then he started getting sick. And on — on the first, like I
mentioned, on the first of January, we le — we decided to leave. And he was already
very sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17" day of the journey,
he passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm, a place near Ural mountains.
He — he died, and I — I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and
he was saying goodbye, and you know, that — and he just gave up. And we left him
on a platform, because when the train sto — I said, Mother — it was about one
o’clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time — the
first thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know.
They took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are
tracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were
already about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My —
Roman, because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the

railroad platform, without — without funeral. We — we tried to get some kind of
arrangement, but 1t was impossible, you know, there — it’s impossible, just leave
here, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put
some wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it’s — that was the
Perm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru — you know,
communication, rails. That — that was the main — main system of moving around,
either freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare.
Q: Was — you said he was saying goodbye to everybody in — as you were talking to
him?
A: No, he was — we were — I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he
gave up, then I — I woke my mother.
Q: Yeah.
A: I didn’t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn’t know that.
Q: Yeah.
A: But it happened during the night, and I — I knew when it happens, and then I
woke my mother, and — and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put
him on the platform, and — and he was left there, with others. But the death was the
normal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can
understand that. We were treated — I can’t even say. Worse than animals, by the

Russians. They didn’t care. Because it — that was Stalin’s policy. You are here until
you die, but in our case, we were — I mean, blessed that it — that we did get out of
that hell. It was pure hell. People don’t realize like — you know, no — no clinic, no
doctor, no help. No, it — they — they didn’t care. We die here or there, today,
tomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was
to get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin’s policy,
you know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to
survive.
Q: Like you said, everybody left —
A: I—I don’t know, I don’t know. I don’t know how to continue, because this 1s —
this is the worst. Worst moment of the life.

A: — the Germans were — were leading some prisoners along the road, from one
place to another because they were, let’s say, taken to do — do some work
somewhere. Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home,
and there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw
potato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started —
Q: To eat it.
A: — eating a si— a raw potato. But the German pri — g-guard, when saw it, he shot
him. And he was still eating when he was —
Q: Falling.
A: — falling, he was still eating that bre — that —
Q: Raw potato.
A: Who — who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another?
Why — why — why did we have this concentration camp? Why they’re so — you
know, mean to each other? Why?
Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself?
A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being,
that they have soul, and responsibility. We — we are not vegetable. We are people
with feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don’t know, some people don’t
believe that, but I — I believe. I— I’m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how

another human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I — I
don’t know. I’ve seen a lot in my life.
Q: Did you — did you ever question while — when you were there, did you ever
question your belief? Did you ever think there — there can be no God, because a —
what I’m seeing is so terrible?
A: No, this — then the — no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you
know, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how —
maybe there isn’t. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human
being, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav —
savages to another people, went free. I — I cannot imagine that. So I think that there
is — there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one
way or the other. But maybe there isn’t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know,
this is probably not for social discussion.
Q: Well, actually, these are the key questions.

A: No, it — the journey was done on a oil tanker. There were —
Q: On an oil tanker, mm-hm.
A: — oil tankers, because they were out of those ships in that area. So they just put

water, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these little
canteens, so filled with water, maybe say a quart of water in there, and it — it —
journey took three year — three days. So, that water didn’t last long, and there was
no water to get on the ship.
Q: Oh, wow.
A: So it was real — that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards
freedom, we are leaving Russia, so everything was —
Q: You — you bore it —

Persia, well, people were just kneeling on the sand, after we got off the tra — off the
ships in the port, and marched towards the transit area, where there were tents, large
tents where we could, you know, relax, and — and one thing, there was one tent
where the — everybody had to go through that. We strip — stripped everything down,

Interview with Anthony Chudzik
January 24, 2015
Q: And why? Why’?
A: Why? I don’t know, I — it probably just a little stretched, what I am going to say,
but England at that time — let’s say I left England in 1956. After the war —
Q: Yeah.
A: — England became socialized — socialist — socialist country. And they really lean
towards the left, towards communist. The — the socialist government under Attlee,
Premier Attlee, etcetera, you know. And they were buddy-buddy with the Russians.
And I say, well, let’s get as far away as possible. So where we go? We go to the
United States. And I was already married.
Q: I see, you married in England.
A: Yeah, I lived in England for 10 years —
Q: That’s a long time.
A: — before I came to United States. But I think, at least, this 1s what I believe now.
Q: Okay.
A: And I tell people that it was too close to comfort.
Q: Too close for comfort.
A: No, no, I mean it was, anyway, because I thought England was getting too bar —
too friendly with the Russians. And I said, who knows? Maybe they’Il —
Q: They’ ll come back.

A: — like now. So, as the — the — the little girls, they were playing somewhere, you
know, etcetera. Then suddenly, they were asking me questions. Says, how do you
know? Oh, I — I listen to you. Yes, and they are one in Chicago, and one other is in
Minneapolis. Both very bright young ladies.
Q: And do they understand? Do you feel that they understand?
A: Yeah, I — I feel that they understand, yes. They understand, and I say — I was
surprised, you know, how they ne — heard almost — I mean, they were never in the
same, say company, they were playing somewhere —

one, they say, oh Dziadziu — dziadziu means grandpa, yes, I remember how you
were talking, you know, about your experiences, and — and they were interested,
and still are, you know.
Q: Here’s ano — here’s a question I don’t often ask, but what would you want the
young people of their generation, who live in Russia, to understand about what you
went through? Because they won’t hear about it yet from history books. They may
at some point.

A: Yes.
Q: But what would you want them to understand about this experience, these years
that you spent there?
A: I don’t expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how
fragile is the human character, or something, that you know, people can change
from being very nice, to being really like an animal to one another. Which I think
you have to be conscious of it and be careful, because you never know what these
people are capable of doing to one another. This is, unfortunately, my experience.
And I — I hope that this will never happen to anybody, the way it happened to me.
But they should be aware of the human frailty, or human — I don’t know what it —
what it is really — that is capable of changing the character of a — of a person.
Q: That we have it in us, and even if we don’t know we do.
A: I do not understand. I do not understand how can people be so mean to each
other. They can be a friend and they so mean.
Q: Yeah.
A: It — it’s — to me, it’s against the human nature. People should be friendly to each
other, helpful. Extend your hand, if you can. Don’t — don’t push away the extended
hand, or be friendly. There — there is no friendliness among people. And that —

that’s very disappointing. Very disappointing. I— even now I says, why do people
fight each o-other, all over?
Q: And these are the things —
A: There — there are some bad, bad people, like the — you know, those terrorists and
everything say, but they are bad, they are criminals. But I’m talking about the
average person.
Q: Yeah.
A: You know, average person. He can be so nice to you, and you can be friend, and
everything. Something may happen.
Q: Well —
A: And they — they destroy each other, or th-they are mean to each other. Then that
hurts me. The meanness of some people. I think I am very friendly to everybody. I
am. I’m sure of it.
Q: Thank you for sharing all this with us today, despite the cost, and I know there is
a cost to it. And I appreciate that openness, and that generosity.
A: I’m very — oh, I am happy that there is a person who wants to listen to it.
