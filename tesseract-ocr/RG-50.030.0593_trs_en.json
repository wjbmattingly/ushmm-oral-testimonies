I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who were Jewish, I don\u2019t think they practiced their religion either, which was not unusual for a lot of German Jews. But I did go to Sunday school. I went to German Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week and it was just part of my growing up, I guess. And then when I came to the United States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which apparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church."

However, in38, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau. Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out after a fo \u2014 short period. And he was there for a month, and the requirements for leaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa to leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I. And my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was sent to Dachau. And then, we\u2019re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but I was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father was the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child\u2019s life. And that when this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already applied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him. So my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which was caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses. He left through Switzerland and then went to England. And he came to England in September of39. My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939, on the Kindertransport."

And I was very surprised, because I thought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to understand. And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster mother disappeared. Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German teacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less traumatic. But from then on, I was on my own.

My English foster mother always gave me tea, like everyone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that that might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it was all right for me to have tea without milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes, she has tea at home all the time. Well, what my mother didn\u2019t realize is that English tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak. And so my mother said no, it\u2019s fine. So I learned to drink English tea, but was not very fond of it.

And my father had a research fellowship in Ypsilanti, Michigan, because he couldn\u2019t practice medicine yet. And then a year later he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us. And the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you could practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of them. So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston, and he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very successful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us through college."

And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a bath first. And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or closet where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you usually dried yourself in there. And I was in there drying myself when I heard one of the twins come up for her bath. And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was the very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn\u2019t it be fun to close the cabinet door and then open it and suddenly say boo. Well, I had made a mistake and it was not Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous. And of course, she cried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room for what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the twins was crying. So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt, opening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept muttering to myself, and you won\u2019t have any, I will eat them all by myself.

She was my sister\u2019s age, and for some reason she recognized me after all those years. And so I explained to her what happened to us. And so we did see the house in 1982."
