When I was standing in the line and a German soldier was coming and checking the line. Who, who is Juden, who is Jewish and kicking out of the line. But my, as a child I didn\u2019t look like Jewish or not Jewish. They didn\u2019t kick me out but they kicked out another little boy that didn\u2019t, that looked Jewish and wasn\u2019t. And he was screaming I am not Juden. And they still kicked him out. I got frightened and I told the man behind me that was standing a beautiful gray haired man with glasses and he told me he is a Doctor Dolinsky and tell your mother that my line is with in front of him. If I go back to my mother because I got frightened of the German soldiers. So I ran back to my mother and I was almost hysterical. I can\u2019t stay there because I\u2019m afraid of the being kicked out from the German soldier. So she came back and she met this Doctor Dolinsky. He is a person that saved our life because he said today is my last day in the line for bread. I am going to cross the border. To the Russian side. So my mother got very, very happy and she said I wish I can do that but we were poor. We had no money. So he said I\u2019m going to tell the farmer that takes me across, that you have no money but he should take whatever you have in the house. And you know my mother didn\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to happen. And next morning 6:00 the farmer did call on the door and he told me that Doctor Dolinsky sent me. I took him on the other side of the border. Was a neutral border between Poland and Russia that was open, supposed to be open 12 or 14 days. So she, the farmer knocked on the door and he says yes, I know you have no money. So he took what we had, a sewing machine and a customer\u2019s fur coat that was hanging behind a screen. That\u2019s all he was able to take. And put us in the wagon, the four of us. Covered us with hay and took us to the neutral zone."

So he says if you feel that, that strong I\u2019m going to let you sleep over at the farmer\u2019s house again. We slept in the farmer\u2019s house on the neutral border.

You\u2019re going https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rose Kamin 34 August 12, 2013 to be away too much. But when he died, I did go. I took five courses in one year and I got so sick and tired physically. I overdid it. So I took two years at university and I didn\u2019t continue. I put too much pressure on myself. That\u2019s a pressure person. And that\u2019s enough. Now I have to make the best of everything. To see anybody that survived like me because most of the people I see depressed and going into dementia and it\u2019s frightening. I still drive."

I had to avoid looking at that. Because that\u2019s like a pain in the chest. How people survived many of them. But Hitler it\u2019s a shock how people could be cruel, but it\u2019s happening all over again in different countries. So how can we change the world? I like to see it change. Like the orthodox do believe the messiah. Where is he? I like to believe in it. Anyways, theater would be good for you to relax your brain. They\u2019re playing a lot of plays here, Yiddish plays in my area. And the reading a lot, that helps."

            "answer": "My granddaughter, the older one is 28, going to be and the younger one 22. The 22 is not settled. She\u2019s finishing her last year university. She doesn\u2019t taking psychology. She 1s taking philosophy. I says where you going to go with that. She would like to get the same degree that her mother has but it\u2019s not necessary. Not everybody has the same capability. So she has to decide this year. She\u2019s undecided girl, but the most adorable person. The older one is graduated from university in social work. Actually she\u2019s working for the government for seeing the mistakes university are doing. If they need help they call the office where she works to reorganize it. That\u2019s a good job for her. But not, she went to private school so she has an easier https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rose Kamin 35 August 12, 2013 time to face life than the younger one. So my daughter made a mistake with the younger one, not sending her to private school for four years. Because the preparation 1s easier. You are prepared for university pressure. And when you don\u2019t have the push you cannot take the pressure. The younger one couldn\u2019t take the pressure so she had to stretch from four years to five which is ok. But still they are wonderful children. Can\u2019t complain."

            "answer": "No. No, because you know there are so many things on the mind that come and go. And you cannot remember everything, but whatever I remember it\u2019s very hard to face for other people. When I hear somebody say starving, I\u2019m starving. I say please don\u2019t use that word starving. Because they don\u2019t know the meaning of it. Starving, not to see a piece of bread for four years, not to see a tomato. Not to see altogether, I didn\u2019t have anything. For four years. How I survived, I\u2019m still here, I must have been very, very strong person, even being a celiac. Anyway, because people think they don\u2019t eat on time. I\u2019m starving, I have to go to a restaurant to eat. Absolutely not. Control your brain. Take a glass of water before you starve so you don\u2019t starve. I don\u2019t like that word starving. Because nobody knows the meaning unless you do it. Anyways I talk too much. That\u2019s my problem. I do, I do. I\u2019m very outspoken and one of my friends, I just had a Canadian girl with a pace maker, she gets depressed because she is doing a lot of work, amazing woman. But she is absent minded person. And she calls me up to relax. So she said after I talk to you we, cause she cannot get used to the pace maker. And she not a week, not a day it\u2019s going to take months. And she wants to go back to dancing now. I said you can do it but be careful. So she fell and I\u2019m trying to help her but there 1s a limit how much I can do. You have to do it yourself. Right. Maybe I am too logical. Really. Nobody can analyze me. Only yourself, you have to analyze. We have to just try and make the best and not to be depressed. I do go into the depression. I can cry easy. Is that better? I am just listening if I cry easy. Very easy. Something on television that reminds me of Europe, I can cry. Yeah, of course. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rose Kamin 36 August 12, 2013"
