My grandma died in Terezin. So I knew her very well. And he grew up in a little town called Votice, in at -- 12 years, he went to Prague to go to a high school, to a -- that time it was called [indecipherable], which is for a s-scientist, like MIT or something like that. And from the age of 12, he was supporting himself, he paid for his studies, all his schools were private, and he supported his parents. And when he that to us, we had never really a knowledge what it meant until we were much older, and understood what he must have been, to come from a little village to a big town, and no money, and take care of himself. Because he said always, \u201cYou have it easy, I pay your school, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d Which was true. My mother on the o -- other hand, came from a very well-to-do family, and the interesting thing 1s that I don\u2019t have a wedding picture of my parents. They got married in Prague, in a civil wedding, not a Jewish wedding. So I think she just went and married him, and maybe my grandfather was -- grandparents didn\u2019t even know about it when they did it, because she came from a well-to-do family, my g -- father was from a poor family.

But I know that we were - my father tried to get out in a way. I don\u2019t know what all this happened. Cause we found a letter that a friend of his from Palestine had a job for him. And I know that my brother took some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn\u2019t know why. You know, we kids were not told anything. We were not told when somebody was sick. As a matter of fact I could never forget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died. I just found out when I came to visit grandma and grandpa was gone. We were never told anything. They didn\u2019t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn\u2019t f -- I didn\u2019t feel we don\u2019t money or something, you know, afterwards. We lived in the same apartment. We didn\u2019t have to move. We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a room that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments, because if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to have it clean of Jews, and they moved out. Somebody else had to take them in. We took in two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their\u2019s. To me they seemed ancient. And then we had a -- when they were deported away, which was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they said Hitler will not get them. But they said they -- they were going to Lodz -- they went in the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we won\u2019t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German Jews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian. We did not, the Czechs, didn\u2019t think about that ever. And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife, because when they left, we had to take somebody else. That was not the German decision that the apartment was too big for a family. And a friend of mine lived with us, too. It was the decision of the Jewish community, agreement. You know, they -- they had to take care of them -- their own people, nobody else would. And I think everyone complied gladly, we didn\u2019t need that much room. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And in the beginning I still got some schooling, a teacher -- a Jewish teacher after work, we could go and read something, books or -- she had some books from history, so I would go in, she talked about history. It really wasn\u2019t schooling, we were just -- they thought to work the brain little bit. And I don\u2019t know whether my parents paid for it, what it was, but I went with my friend to this s -- but second thing was that Jews have a -- eight o\u2019clock you have to be home. Jews were not allowed to be on the streets from eight to five unless they had a special permit. Jews had -- there was from the beginning, eight o\u2019clock was Sperre, we called.

You have to understand, by this time we are teenagers, so we want to be out little later. We couldn\u2019t. That was the next thing. Then came that we were not allowed to go through park. So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks. Nothing where green grew, you could go around. Then we were not allowed to go to the main squares. To the [indecipherable] like [indecipherable] squares, the old squares, you had to go around, on the out squares. Then came you couldn\u2019t go in the street car, only the last train, the last platform. And if it was full, 1t was your bad luck, you couldn\u2019t get on, couldn\u2019t get on, wait for the next one. We couldn\u2019t go to any coffeehouses, because the Czechs were -- even the young one used to be -- would go for a coffee or dessert in the afternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee. That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all, no movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing. So what we did, like young people, we met in -- every Saturday and Sunday with a group, in somebody else\u2019s house. And what was happening, these groups became very close. You couldn\u2019t bring a friend unless everyone agreed. It was like a social club, you know, because you couldn\u2019t have it grow big, because only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by others and it could be considered that we are planning something against the Germans, or- so the groups had to be very small. I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when we put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed it to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon. At 7:30 I had to be home. It was only for the afternoon. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did 1s he let out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and everything because he says he\u2019s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans. And the radio we didn\u2019t give up either. From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and switched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station. And my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father what\u2019s happening at night, slip in under darkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did get. So you didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- were not allowed to have a telephone. All my life I -- we had a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward. So they\u2019d stripped us of everything, and every time we thought it\u2019s the last thing. And another thing what the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against the Jews. So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were thinking, what will come this time? What will they take away this time? The jewelry? This is my mother\u2019s ring. She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar. So that\u2019s her -- I don\u2019t know whether it was her mother\u2019s or whether my father gave it to her. But when I had it checked, they said it\u2019s 1900 cut. That she hid for me. But you know, it came slow. All these people say why didn\u2019t you ever -- weapons -- first thing was weapons. My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver- had a -- a handgun at home. So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing. So they stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave, you had no rights at all. And you -- if you didn\u2019t step -- when the SS man walked on the pavement, when -- we had to step down into the gutter, whatever. We were not allowed to be in the pavement when the SS walked by."

Each room we were about 40 women in the room, and there was one woman who was called Zimmeralteste, which means the oldest of the room. And she was the one who made the decisions. So -- but she was pretty good, she -- you know, honored some request, it didn\u2019t change anything for her. So it didn\u2019t matter if I was in the corridor, meanwhile, when my mother came she was in the corridor. She couldn\u2019t climb up because she suffered from sciatica nerve, otherwise I would have switched with her, but 1t couldn\u2019t. And then she got right away a bed because of that, so you know, she made those decisions, she also made sure everything is clean, that the room looks clean, because there were checks sometimes. And- and I don\u2019t know by whom, but we were always expecting some inspections. And then she also was the one that distributed the rations. You got a ration of bread. Sometimes you got little bit of milk, which was like bluish water. And sometimes you got little bit of sugar, and margarine, those were the rations. So she got the whole thing, and she had to divide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more, you got two. Bread was always the same, you got a piece of bread, that was for three days. Being me, the first time I got the bread I ate it. In two days I didn\u2019t, so I learned very fast that I marked how much bread I can eat every day. And that was only once that it happened that I ate it all. And I took little bit supply from what I had from mar. So, she was the responsible person. She also decided if we had little bit of wood, when to heat up the room or not, because there was only little stove, in that -- in -- for winter. So it was pretty cold, but you had the blankets. You did have blankets. So we slept with Eva huddled together under two blankets, we didn\u2019t need each a blanket. In summer it was much worse. The bedbugs were terrible, and we would take our mattresses and put it on the corridor outside, in front of the room, along the -- you know how these windows are in Hamburger -"

We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming in, some got earlier. The next day my father said that\u2019s it, the family has to be together, you have to move in. So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing. I didn\u2019t like to be separated. My brother was again with them, and I was in.
