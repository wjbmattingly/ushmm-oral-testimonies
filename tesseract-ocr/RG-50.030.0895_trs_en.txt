A: I—I have to tell you the whole story, because my story doesn’t make sense, with
my answers. So, I have to tell you how I don’t know things, and why I don’t know
things.
Q: Okay.
A: All right?
Q: Okay.
A: So, the first thing I remember, I was four years old, and I found myself in a
place, the snow was higher than I was. A lot of people crying, crying, tearing of the
clothes, and a big commotion. And nobody pays attention to me. When we left, I
said to somebody, where are we? What is this place? And they said, this is a
cemetery, and we just buried your mother. I was four years old. I was told she died
from a brain tumor, on the operating table. So my f— we get home, when I stay with
my grandmother, and my father moved in, and we were the three of us, because
Grandpa died just before. And was a very difficult life, because my mother was so
young, and my grandmother couldn’t take the pain, and the sorrow, to lose a young
daughter like that. So, we covered by rel — Jewish religion, we cover the mirrors
when someone dies, and we did cover it, and after 30 days you’re supposed to take
it off, but she never took it off. As my — as long as I remember, the mirrors were
covered. So, being that I had no one to take care of me, my Aunt Ella hired a

governess, whose name was Mimi. So Mimi took care of me since I was four years
old, til right after the war. And we did everything together, schoolwork, fun work.
She taught me lots of etiquette; she felt it was very important. She taught me how to
boil eggs warm water, in case. [indecipherable] in case of what? Everything is
good to know. Everything is good to know. I was ironing, I was washing, cause she
did tell me all these things. And I was very content, she was very, very good to me.
And couldn’t be happier, except the house where I lived with Grandma, it was a
very sad house. And I — the children didn’t want to play with me, because I was
always sad. And — and this is how the years went by. And I went to school, and
when in 1944, Mimi wanted to leave. And we didn’t understand why Mimi wants
to leave. And she said that in her home, there is a catastrophe, and she has to leave.
Doesn’t matter how much she loves me, she has to leave. So that was an indication
that some political change is going through. But of course the news was handled
through the government, and fa — also the radio. There wasn’t any television or
anything, like today. So, in a quiet, buzzing way, we heard that the German army
took over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other parts of Hungary, Poland, France, all
the eastern European countries. And we heard this stuff, and it was very surprising,
because we don’t know this stuff, we don’t know these things. Could I have a drink
of water, please? [interruption]

Q: So you said you were — over the radio, and newspaper, you were hearing little
bits and pieces about what was happening outside —
A: Right.
Q: — the Germans, you know, their activity. And so you — and then you were about
to tell us about your governess, Mimi, leaving.
A: Mimi left, went back to Switzerland, and so it was my grandmother, and my
aunt didn’t live with us, but my father remarried, three years before.
Q: So, in 1941.
A: Right. They married a very nice person, and they had the child together. Her
name was Susan, Susan. They wanted me to live with them, and I wanted to live
with them, because I was tired of the old atmosphere, and the sadness, and the
covered mirrors, and all that. But my grandmother wouldn’t allow it. She says,
you’re my only contact to my daughter, and I’m not letting you go.
Q: So because you were your mother’s only child, she wanted to keep you there.
A: And she stated it with so much common sense, that nobody was arguing about it.
So I stayed with my grandmother, and contacted my stepsister once in a while. Very
— you know, it — and then in three years they were together only — only three years,
and then became 1944. And so that day, that big day came, when tanks, and military
machines, and guns, and unbelievable attack on every house. They just shoot. They

were shooting without aiming. They just were shooting. And then a young man, a
German fellow, soldier, came in yelling and yelling and pushing. Broke down the
front door, and he said, schnell, schnell, that means hurry, hurry. And I had what I
had on, not special clothes or anything. I just grab my pocketbook, and — and for —
for 1-identification, and — and — and a little jacket, that’s all.
Q: And up until this point, had your life in Budapest been pretty normal?
A: Yes.
Q: Nothing had changed, there weren’t any restrictions?
A: No, no. Some thing — restrictions were in the schools. They didn’t have religious
classes, so they combined the Christian classes with the Jewish classes. However,
they didn’t make us to kne — knee down — kneel down, or any other things. So we
sat in the back, and we just sat there. And our building had three flights. One — two
staircases. One was for the residents, and one was for the delivery and maintenance.
And he keeps on pushing me, the soldier, and I’m going to where I always go, to the
resident s-staircase. And he starts to hit me with the — with the rifle back, and you
lousy ge — Jew, you don’t deserve to be on the — on that staircase. You go where the
delivery is, where — where the maintenance men are. And he was very upset. And I
turned around, went over there, and he started to hit me. I lost three or four teeth —
moving teeth, was loose. And he kicked me down from the third floor, spiral —

spiral staircase, to the bottom. So I had lot of bleeding. I cut my head. And he — th-
the order was to meet downstairs. When someone was injured, you stay here, one —
were you able to walk, you stay here. So my aunt was very worried that I — I have
too much blood on me. So where — why — where they gonna put me? So she licked
off the blood, and she swallowed it. I really don’t know if you could comprehend
what that means, to lick off my niece’s blood, and swallow it. And she cleaned me
out, so I was return on the cl — on the okay people. The not well people were shot
right away, right front of me. Neighbors, students, friends, teachers, they were shot
right there, front of me.
Q: All people you knew.
A: Who were — lived in the house, and people I know. Storekeepers I sold — I went
to. And I just looked, I looked. And then Ella says, what you looking? Stay with me
now. I said, why? Because. And then on the loudspeaker came, everybody goes to a
stadium, and there’s someone gonna lead you, and stay in the line, and go to the
stadium. Stadium was six miles away. You could just physically imagine me, whose
mouth was cut, or head was cut, walking with my grandmother, six miles away. It
sounds not so specifically bad, but in actuality, to put yourself physically in this
situation is — 1s — 1s unreal that — that someone ask you to do this, but don’t forget,
we were the healthy ones.

Q: And it’s mar — March, right?
A: March. March.
Q: So there is — is there still snow out, and it’s —
A: It’s March, cold, snow, and wet. And we went [indecipherable] in the morning,
10 o’clock, and finally, finally we got to the stadium.
Q: And had — had other — did — ha — did you have to march through the city of
Budapest —
A: Yes.
Q: — to get there? So what — did you notice the reactions of people in town, as they
saw all these people being marched?
A: It was a wide lane, you know, it’s not just two or three. So, I really couldn’t see
on th — where — what they do there, where — I heard, there — good for them, that’s
what they deserve, that’s what they deserve, good for them.
Q: This is what people are yelling at?
A: Yelling at. And it was just — after shooting all these people, it was just such a
bad, bad feeling I had. I really didn’t care what did they say to me at this point. So,
getting to the stadium was a miracle, a miracle by itself. Was about one or two
o’clock, I don’t know how long. And there were benches, and we sat in the 10"
row, 12 row, I don’t know, and they said the first row, second row, threed row —

August 26, 2016
third row, fourth row, go down to the bus, and they take you to your destination. No
one would ask where is our destination, where are we going. No one. I was hungry
already, and I was tired, but nothing. After, we found out that those buses took you
to — to Auschwitz, and to all the camp, but we didn’t know it then. So my Ella says
to me, you know, it’s already four o’clock, can’t go on forever. Let’s go all the way
up, because the lower lanes moving. Let’s go all the way up. So we went all the way
up, and — and she was right. And then there was a young Hungarian soldier, a young
boy, who used to be her newspaper boy. And she was very good to him all the time.
And she called over the boy. Now, how did she trust that boy, I have no clue.
You’re doing things which — which you don’t know the risk you’re taking. You
don’t need the risk you’re taking. She called him over, she says, would you walk us
out of the stadium? We will come back tomorrow. And the boy did. So, he took us
out, an — to the — outside the we — stadium. And you know, it’s about evening, it
gets dark early, and now what? But God gave us good Christian people. That
Christian people, Mrs. Mona(ph), was my aunt’s client. She had the store like bed
and bath, bedding and the t-towels, and this kind of a stores.
Q: Oh, like ho —- Home Goods.
A: Home Goods. And she did very elegant work, wa — which included
monogramming. And she had the very fancy clients, they had the crowns, and two —

Interview with Edith Palkowitz :
August 26, 2016
two legs on the crown told you who you are, three legs on the crown told you who
you are. So this Mrs. Mona(ph), we — a year before this all started, came into the
store, and she said — very religious woman, very religious Christian woman. She
says, I love you both, but Edith, I want to give you a cross, and it’s blessed by the
Holy Mother, and Ella, I want to give you a cross. You know, not thi — I’m not
disrespectful, but I didn’t know what holy water is, holy cross, I don’t know, I
didn’t know, I was 13 years old then, when she gave it to me.
Q: She gave you each a crucifix?
A: Yes, no.
Q: Oh, just a cross necklace?
A: Yes.
Q: Little like medallion, or —
A: And the — yeah, yes, yes, yes. And that — no, a cr — a cross.
Q: A cross.
A: Yeah. I still have it. So I forgot about it, took a pocketbook before I left to that
stadium. And so we went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she cleaned us up. I’ve a — and
then, in big signs, if you help any Jew, without any trial, you'll be shot. No excuses,
no discussions. So we didn’t want to stay with her, because we were afraid of — for

her life. And then the news came out that they’re selling tickets to a safe house,
which is managed by the Vatican, and a Vatican flag flies over it.
Q: In Budapest?
A: In Budapest. You know, that’s all we knew. I mean, how you — how you fi —
figured it out, is it true, 1s 1t not, what did it mean. So my Ella, she could afford it,
she had money with her, so she bought for the three of us, two tick — three tickets,
and we went there. It’s a two bedroom apartment, about 40 people. Every night I
felt urine in my mouth, because there was only two bathroom for 40 people. But
looking outside the window, we were still happier to be there, than outside. And
then came the big surprise, that the ticket was only good for 14 days. And now,
what do we then do now? So as we went downstairs, at the door, the Germans were
waiting for us, and put us in the ghetto. And then in the ghetto, we were put in the
worst apartment, and every day we were marching outside. I had the hole in my
shoes, put in newspaper, and by one o’clock [indecipherable] got wet, and melted
from the snow. And very, very degrading person I became. Degrading person who
everybody loved, and Mimi loved, and had everything in the world, and now I’m
walking on the street, and some idiot throwing a — a pox on me, and cursing and
whatnot. Who are these people? I don’t know. I mean, it’s a different neighborhood,
a different zip code, I’d never been there before. And then, I felt that I don’t want to

do this any more. So I said to her — oh, Grandma went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she —
she was hiding there. She had the basement, and she wouldn’t let her go. My
grandmother.
Q: So your grandmother was still at Miss Mona’s?
A: Yes.
Q: But you and your aunt go to the safe house?
A: Yes.
Q: You’re separated at this point.
A: Right. And then Ella and I was in the ghetto. And I said to Ella, I said, look,
let’s get out of the — the — the lane. I mean, they’re not going to kill us. Oh Edith,
please honey, of course, they’re gonna kill us. She called me Chirpy, that was my
nickname, Chirpy.
Q: Chirpy”
A: Yes. And it’s a very warm name, you know, it’s a very loving name. And she
says, Chirpy, this is crazy what you’re thinking. Ella, I’m not going to stay here,
and be here six, seven, eight months. I mean, I — 1 — I— I went on to nothing. And
we didn’t eat, and we didn’t trust anyone to — to talk to, because if people told about
other people, hoping to get extra food.
Q: So you — you didn’t know who to trust.

Interview with Edith Palkowitz .
August 26, 2016
A: No ca—no one to trust. So I walked like on the side of the line, already get back
in the line, get back in the line. So, in the 10, 11" month, one day I walk with Ella,
and I’m talking to her. I said, listen Ella, Ill go out there, you don’t have to. But
this is terrible, this is really not something that I — we don’t know how long it’s
gonna be. In the meantime we had the — heard about the Polish reso — revolution,
that they killed the underground people, and — and — and it was terrible.
Q: Oh, the — the Warsaw uprising.
A: Right.
Q: So you were hearing bits and pieces from [indecipherable]
A: Right, right. She says — and then I said, why don’t you answer me, why don’t
you answer me? And she is nowhere. Somebody pulled her out of the lane, and I
can’t find her. So, I was all by myself, and I think that was my worst day, when I
lost everything; all the confident, all the hope, all the — all the attention, everything.
I lost everything. So I went back to — upstairs to live, and in a couple of days, I
walked out of the line. And the soldier comes to me, what the hell are you doing?
With the big rifle. I didn’t say anything. He said, let me see your papers.
Q: Was this a German, or a Hungarian soldier?
A: A German.
Q: A German soldier.

August 26, 2016
A: German. And I spoke fluently German, remember? But I couldn’t say a word,
the words didn’t come out. What shall I say? He holds the rifle, and he says, give
me your identification paper. And I actually, effectively started to shake, and I
dropped my bag, and the cross fell out, what Mrs. Martin gave me. And he said,
just go. And I feel this is a miracle. I feel that it’s a miracle that the cross fell out. It
was about six, seven o’clock already. So I wanted to go to Mrs. Mona(ph), I didn’t
know exactly where she lived, and — and — and I didn’t had money. So I remember
taking buses, and trains, and whatnot. And I told the bus driver I’m a student, and I
lost all my money. He says, that’s all right. He didn’t know I was Jewish. And then
there was a fruit store, and I said to the owner, do you have any fruit which you
can’t sell, which is damaged, because I’m very hungry. So he went in the back, and
he brought me out some fruit, and it was wonderful, because I was very hungry. So
finally I found Mrs. Mona(ph) house.
Q: The same Miss Mona(ph) who you had stayed with before.
A: Right. And she opened the door, and she says, can I help you? She didn’t
recognize me. I mean, after 11 months in the ghetto, she didn’t recognize me. I says,
Mrs. Mona(ph), this is Chirpy. Oh Chirpy, please come in. Let me take care of
you. And — and — and, she did. Again, the same situation where I wouldn’t allow
myself to stay there, and risk her life, and her family life. I mean, such a decent

person, how could I do that to her? So, a friend of a friend of a friend recommended
me to be a mother’s helper. So I left Mrs. Mona(ph) after three days, and then — this
was end of already finish — almost finished, everything. I went to this lady, she had
four children, and she was thrilled to have me. Which mother is not happy to have a
mother’s helper, you know? And she lived on a 10 flight house. And she said, oh,
I’m so happy with you. Everything was fine. However, as it was the tail end of it
already, the last months, in April 1945, that’s when the liberation was. And the
Germans, and the Russians and the Hungarians fought a staircase, the f — the — the
elevation, the f — third floor, fourth floor, fifth floor, all different soldiers. I didn’t
know which is which because they all wore the boots, and they all had rifles. I
didn’t know which soldier was [indecipherable] but they didn’t bother us, they
were just fighting. For one floor they fought like two days.
Q: And so this was —
A: To take over the floor.
Q: So it’s during the — the Siege of Budapest —
A: Right.
Q: — that this is happening.
A: Right, right.

A: Right.
Q: Wow.
A: Yes. And we went on to the downstairs, to the basement, and that was equipped
with the kitchen appliances, refrigerator and food. And they call it bunker, bunker.
And we sometimes slept there, too. But there wasn’t much of a time, there was — in
the meantime, was no food at all. So the — they took horses, which one was shot
before — there was no man, every man was in the army — women took the horse,
sliced it up and made the stew out of it, or a soup out of it. And when I heard it, I
went like this, you know? And th-the woman says, a rough woman, she says, if you
hungry enough, you gonna eat it. And I was hungry enough to eat it.
Q: These were horses that had been shot that —
A: Right.
Q: — somebody found, and —
A: Was si-sitting on the street, lying on the street.
Q: Right in front of the building?
A: Right in front of the building. And I asked Mrs. Mona(ph) when I got there,
where’s Ella? And she said, she’s trying to hide, by friends. She had a lot of friends,
because she had the store, you know? She knew a lot of people. Well, I was there
two months, at the — at this person, and then the Russians came in and shot all the

Germans, and told them to go to ru — you coming with us to Russia. But there were
no Germans any more, they were the Russians now. And the Hungarians were
arrested, too. So the Russians said, we help you Jews. Somehow, nobody believed
them. They didn’t do anything for us. We were freezing. They had — didn’t give us
any food. So, they said, now you are free to go wherever you want to. But the
problem was, we didn’t have the strength to go anywhere. We had no place to go.
Every house looks like a — a toy house, full of holes, full of holes, just like the
people were damaged, shot, to the [indecipherable]. And then, about three days
later, the English soldiers came to liberate. And then, we felt free. Every soldier
took two, three people, and only took care of those two or three people. And
blanket, and food, and tea, and — and — and for the head. April is a rough month, it’s
very windy, and cold, and the — that’s when we were free, that’s when we were
liberated, in April 1945. Can we pause now?
Q: Sure, let’s take a — a quick break. [break]
A: After the English people came in, and the soldiers, we were really free to go, and
— and before we’re able to leave, they had to straighten us up a little bit, out. I mean,
the strength, the — the blankets, the food, and the kind words, and where you want
us to take you. The house, I will tell you about that that after this, because it has its
own story.

A: Yes, for forced labor, yeah.
Q: Do you remember what year?
A: About — let me see that, 1945, 1944. 1944. A year before. So, we started to be —
was — was nothing open, there wasn’t a store open. Peddlers sold fruit and
vegetables and oil, and eggs, whatever is absolutely necessary, but wasn’t enough.
So Ella and I went out to the railroad, and said, let’s go to the — because her — she
embroidered all her stuff. So that — embroidery comes from small town, far away,
small, little bit back, left town, you know. A little education, and whatever. So, she
felt that if we go to those ladies who work for her, they have some supply. So we go
out one day, is no room on the train. We go out the second day, is no room on the
train. And that kept on going, and then see, there’s somebody sitting on the top of

the train. So what do you do? You go on the top of the train. How do you go on top
of the train? You take a rope, and you tie yourself on top of the train. About two
hours of ride. And you don’t move, you don’t breathe, you don’t anything, just hold
onto the rope.
Q: So in order to get to the small town where your aunt had business contacts —
A: Right.
Q: — you had to go up to the top of the cars.
A: Because there’s no room in the train. Everybody had the same idea. So we went
there, to these people, and they were very gracious, and — I mean, they were
working with Ella 20, 25, 30 years, it’s not a—as-—a short relationship. Ant they
packed us up flour, eggs, oil, I don’t know what else, in big bag. Not bags, in sacks.
So you think that was hard to go out to — on the train going there, but to bring this
stuff with us — so we put everything on top of the train, tied it down, and bring it
with us. And it — it worked, it worked. You know, like I was with the horse food, I
would never think I eat it, never, ever. And I ate it, and you know what, I enjoyed it.
When you were hungry enough, you eat it. Anyway, so we were trying to
recuperate our lives, schools were closed, and people came back, and — from the
concentration camps, and it was a situation which coming back from hell, because it
was hell. They were like 60 pounds, 70 pounds, and he kept us in. I only came back

No one was alive. No one was alive. There is a Jewish synagogue there, the biggest
and largest synagogue in eastern Europe. It’s spelled, the Dohan, do — d-o-h-a-n
Temple. I have a picture. And they — and they threw the dead bodies there, so
people came, and with their hands, they dug up the rocks and everything, in the
hope that they feel some of their relatives. So the Jewish people build a tree there,
and I’d like you to take a picture of it late-later. And every leaf represents a person.
Hundreds and thousands of leaves. It was terrible, and the magnitude of people
came back, they didn’t — nobody handled us. I mean, the — the English people help
us with food, whatever, but what can they do? And the months went by, the years
went by, and about three years later, I decided to leave Hungary.
Q: Before we go there, so when you have these survivors of the camps coming
back, is the first time that you, and other people who had been in Budapest the
entire time, this is the first time you are really learning —
A: Yes.

I ask Grandma, how come Mother left - Mommy left, and she says — and I said to
her, didn’t she like me, did I do something bad? And she says, oh no, she loved you,
but she had to go. Not that she wanted to go, but she had to go. Of course, later —
later years I understood what she said, but it was very hard to comprehend at the
time. And going back now, after three years of liberation, I wanted to leave. But

hours from London, in a hospital, a doctor. And gave me a student visa, a nurse
student visa. So I packed up whatever I had, and went to London. Somebody was
supposed to wait for me, nobody showed. It was so foggy that I said, excuse me,
and the next day I saw it was a mailbox. It was so foggy. So I tried to call a number,
I didn’t end up going, so I didn’t had the number. Finally, somebody came to pick
me up, and took me to Essex, and I met that Hungarian doctor who send me the six
months student visa. So next day I went to the hospital, and — and we going to the
lowest floor. Good thing I didn’t read English, because it says, the morgue.

way you look. And you know, I was an average child, little more educated than an
average — I spoke perfect German, and Mimi(ph) taught me everything. But even I
couldn’t understand that. I couldn’t understand that. But I stayed there for four
months. I collected enough money to go to London, and get the same job, a
mother’s helper job.

a time to have an abscessed tooth, how can you figure that? How — what are the
chances? But you had no money, of course, and he says, I take care of you. And he
took care of me without money. So I go to the immigration, face to face to the
person who handled my case, and he said, you’re all right. And then said, wait a
minute, one number is wrong. I says, what do you mean, wumber — number is
wrong. He says, they didn’t okay you, they okayed someone else.
Q: Oh, your — your visa? They approved someone else.
A: A mistake. A mistake. So, while I was in England, I made some connection to —
because you — England didn’t have any Jewish offices or consulate, or anything, so
I — these two people, not there — people told me that in Paris, they do have. So I got
the address, I got the phone number, and I called up, and there’s always many

Q: And — I’m sorry wa-was it a Jewish organization that —
A: Yes, the Jewish Federation.
Q: Jewish Federation, okay.
A: That time it was called the HIAS.
Q: HIAS, okay.
A: And they put me in an apartment, in a — in a room with three girls, and it was
fine. I mean, what I had before, everything was fine. And they fed me, and — and I
went to work in a fur shop, because I knew how to sew. And in the first shop, I
sewed in the lining to mink coats. Now, I don’t know if you’re familiar with, how
could you, but the leather, to sew, it — all my fingers were bleeding, because to sew
through leather, it’s almost impossible. But you do, you do, you do. And so I
worked part-time, and we gave in that, to a school, my visa application. And I was
in Paris for two years, and I was told that I have the visa.

Q: Okay. So —
A: In 1948, I got the visa. Now, ’'m— I’m — I’m very seasick, and I’m a very bad
traveler. I have this phobia, I can’t look down, I can’t travel. It’s — it’s —1t’s bad. So
they put us in a— in a broken down ship. Took three weeks to get there, and I was
right away in the — in the hospital. Nobody came in. There was a Russian lady
brought me food, out of her — good of her heart. Cause she couldn’t talk, she felt
sorry for me. So she came with food. I asked the doctor, what shall I do? There’s no
doctor there [indecipherable] cruise. Three weeks. Three weeks in the hospital
room. So then the ship engine stopped. No — even my Russian lady wasn’t there. No
one was there. And I hear some yelling, anybody’s here, anybody’s here? So I
understood it, and I yell, I’m here, I’m here. So this American soldier says, what
you doing here? Everybody left — leaved the ship already. I says, well, I am in the
hospital for three weeks already, an-and — and everybody left, they left me, they
forgot about me. And I said, where are we? Are we in the ocean, where are we? No.

me up and took me upstairs. He says, look, that’s the Lady of Liberty. Holding me
like this. Very happy, you know. Very few times I cried of happiness in my life, but
that was the time when I cried of happiness. So we went to Ellis Island. And the
reason we went to Ellis Island, because that’s a — a spy ship I came with, some
Russian spy ship. And they took it apart completely. I was three months in Ellis
Island, so was everybody else. And they ask question. But you know, Ellis Island
looked like the Ritz Carlton, you know, to me, because nobody bothered me,
everybody was nice to me, and the only thing I didn’t like when they closed the
sliding doors, you know, the prison doors. But everything else was fine.
Q: So what — what was it like staying — you just —
A: They had questions, and they said, were you aware of that — that it’s a sky — spy
ship? I said, I wasn’t ever aware of anything, I was in the hospital the whole time.
Could you — could you verify this? I said, how can I verify it? If you have that the
ger — Russian lady, says 90 percent they were Russians. So, do you know the lady’s
name? You know how she looks? I says, I know how she looks, but I don’t know
her name. Anyway, so they let us go after three we — months. It’s a long time, three
months, but it was okay. Very tiresome for me to talk about this, but I really want to
do it. Then I came to the Bronx, in New York, to a— a — a far relation, a cousin
removed couple of times. So she took me in her wings — under her wings. And she

had one bedroom, and the living room was a pull out couch, and that’s where I
slept. And she says, you know how to sew, you have to go to a factory, where you
make money. So I went to a dress shop, I made fairly enough, I paid my rent there,
was five dollars. And she cooked for me. And the boss of the store didn’t pay, he
went bankrupt. It was not a union place. You know, it’s amazing where I took the
strength, where I took the hope, after all this slapping in the — on the face, you
know? I mean, how much — how much can you take? I was 19 years old. How much
can you take? So I went to another shop, which was very successful. I was there for
10 years. On a Hungarian New Year celebration, I met the young man. His name
was Sam Palkowitz, and he was a refugee too, but he was in this country already
couple years. He went to school to get his accountant CPA license. And at night he
worked in a delicatessen, and so he finance his — himself with the money he made
in the delicatessen. And after two years, we got married. He always said I married
him because he was legal here, that he had the green card. It’s not true. Is not true.
But I told [indecipherable] oh my God, you know? It wasn’t oh my God, but I
didn’t have better offers. And so we were married, everything was fine, we had two
children, and then Sam got the CPA degree. He went to work for a CPA fir-firm,
and I got my high school equilency diploma, and I went to work for a bank. And I
was there for 13, 14 years, and became the — the manager of the bank. I stepped up

very nicely. And we were fine. My son Arthur is an attorney, a part-time judge,
and my daughter has her own real estate business. They all very successful, because
I pushed them to no end. And I always said — and I’m saying on a public speaking,
that knowledge is power. That’s what it says on 42™ Street, in the library, and it’s
true. That’s the only thing no one can take it away from you. Everything else goes.
And they listened to me. And then the kids grew up, they went to college, and
whatever. And I think getting from my birth, to getting to America, that’s my story.
Lot of obstacles, lot of painful episodes, but that was the cards dealt to me. So, we
could go on to America now, but I said most of it, anyway. I don’t want to go into
America, because I just said it, but I want to speak about my father.
Q: Yes, I wanted to ask what was happening with him, and your ste —
A: There was an announcement, that who is between 25 and 45 years of age, go to
somewhere, a stadium, or whatever, go and be there. Who doesn’t come will be
shot. So, we didn’t know what, my father was 37, 38, and he went there, and they
took him to Kiev. On the — on the 30 degree cold — minus 30 degree, they made all
of them, not only my father, work. Their work was to build a bridge, and the next
day they — they blew up the bridge — the bridge. They used them as mined — you
know what’s a mine? People dig on the ground and if you step on it, it blows up.
The field mines. And they used them as a mine finder.

A: Where the mines are, for the other soldiers to come. And they — they did that for
months, and my father stepped on one of the mines, and took off one half of his leg.
So he was taken to the hospital. And then, that happened again, at the tail end. And
then the Germans pushed back the — the Russians pushed back the Germans, and the
Germans had to leave, and before they left, they poured gasoline on the hospital,
and burned it down. And this is not the hearsay, because the Red Cross had notified
US.
Q: So they burned down the hospital with everyone in it?
A: Yes. Now, my — my Aunt Ella’s husband, Emory(ph), had the father and a
mother. The mother was a piano teacher, and the father had a store, it’s like Ace
Hardware, but it was very specialized, very good business. And a very tall,
handsome Hungarian soldier came, with many decorations on his jacket, came to
the house, to that house where I showed you, and he said, Emory(ph) has to go to
[indecipherable] my uncle has to go, but the father could be saved, if you write
over the deed to me, the house deed. It was as quiet as now here. What do you do?
So my uncle said, listen, alive is more than a house, and he wrote over the deed to
the soldier. About a half a mile away, before the ink dried, they shot my grandpa
and threw him out of the car. I went back, to try to get back, cause it’s worth over

A: — right, yeah.
Q: So as soon as they say, you know, sign over, he’ll be safe, they turn around and —
A: Yes. And this is just about the highlights. I could sit here and talk to you for
days, because I only put everything in a nutshell. But since that — when I was four
years old, and came out to America, it was nothing good, only bad. But not just a
little bad, a drama. A thing where people don’t get through easy. I went in America
to — for 20 years, for clinical psychiatry studies. I had so much hatred in me. I had
so — never wanted to forgive, never. But by psychiatrists I’m told, if you forgive,
you release yourself, you are the winner. You don’t hold the — the bitterness against
people. They — if you really — if you forgive them, you are the winner, not the other
people. And I felt that these people are educated, and smart, and — and — and for 20
years, I went to these meetings. Did I forgive? I don’t know. Did I forget? No. But
I’m going on with my life. I’m not a religious Jew, I’m not. Never been. I do

me, and made that cross fell out from my purse. And whoever watched over me,
and God did that, and I’m very grateful for it. And if you have some question,

A: Yeah.
Q: Your father is sent to forced labor, but what about —
A: What — before? For three years they were married.
Q: Yes.
A: And my father worked, and my stepmother, right away, she was very business-
like. She worked. She had made a little business for herself. The — the boots, what
the government didn’t use, which was — had a cut at the leg for some reason, she
bought up those boots, and she opened a little — not even a store, like a peddler, you
know? And she sold that, and she made so much money. She liked me. She
preferred I don’t live there, because I was still a package from the previous
marriage. But if — I can’t say that she was mean to me or anything. The sister was a
different story. The sister said that the father — my father loved me much more than
loved her. And my stepmother used to say, no, it’s not true. So, she had the — she

has problems. She went back to Hungary to live, and my stepmother lived here in
America, married three times. If I want to be ugly, I would say, buried three
husband. But I have nothing to complain about her, nothing. So, past 20 years, I
went back to visit them. And she said, Daddy is looking down, and he’s very happy
that you come and visit us. And so, whatever truth 1n it 1s, I did.

they — they think she was an angel, you know? I mean, she did so many favor. That
time, people didn’t make donations, you know? Or have people like the newspaper
boy. When he needed some books or something, came to Ella and says, could you
help me out? I give you back the money. So she gave him the money, and always
helped him. And — and I guess that’s why he did what he did. I don’t know. That’s
what he did. And a good deed comes back. Good deed comes back to you. And you

wonderful children. Wonderful children. Ambitious, and good, and — my son is 60
years old, was last week, and every mother says that, I think what I have the best
children in the world. I’m probably a little prejudiced, but that’s okay. That’s okay.
And so are my grandchildren. I’m very close to them. My husband died 15 years
ago. He had the aneurysm, and in two weeks, he died. He didn’t suffer with cancer
or anything, which I was very grateful for.
Q: And he was a survivor as well?
A: Yes, he was. He was from Czechoslovakia. He was on a — on a— ona bus,
transport bus there. I mean, I didn’t know him then. And he jumped off the bus, and
he broke his knee. And the bus stopped, and they, with their rifle, they hit his knee,
the one that was broken, til he passed out. And they left him there. He said, this is
your punishment, to try to escape. His father was a very rich man. His father comes
from north Hungary, northern Hungary, Ungvar, it’s — he had the winery, huge
winery. Was very rich, and very powerful man. And he went to Auschwitz, and
they couldn’t kill him. They did — he was such a strong, big man, whatever job they
gave him, he did it. And the last day, they shot him. He didn’t come with me for the
therapy, he couldn’t. He says, I can’t pour out my heart to a stranger. He never

grateful to.
Q: So you — you mentioned that you visited — you visited Hungary several times.
A: Yes.
Q: — since moving to America. Was it strange being back?
A: I didn’t look at the houses, I didn’t look at anything. I stayed in a hotel.
Sometimes I went with friends, with American friends. And — but I don’t like to go
to a hotel by myself. It’s not for a special reason. And then we — with my friend
being [indecipherable] trip to Italy, or whatever, some other places, and then we
visited Irene, my stepmother, and my stepsister. And we st-stayed with them two,
three, four days, five days, according to a plan.

A: Was hard.
Q: Yeah.
A: Was hard. And then late — later, I visit — visited or so frequently, because it got
more painful. And as you get older, it’s harder to deal with it. But I did visit, I really
did. But then my stepsister died, my stepmother died. She was 92, my stepmother.

you decide to do that?
A: Which part of it?
Q: I guess, what — what made you decide to start speaking to groups, and telling
them about your experiences?
A: Oh. I was invited first, in a jail. And then I was invited — it’s a name, a leave —
life — or a leave — a life. It’s a group which is built by the government, and
teenagers, 12, 13, 14, 15 — and I go there every year — are pregnant. So this
organization take them to high school, and teach them high school, and they
arranging a nursery for the children. And they were very down. I didn’t say half of
my story. Less than half. But I encourage them that there is no choice not to do
anything, because if you don’t do anything, you’re going backwards. And who
wants to go backwards? Your child doesn’t deserve for you to give up. So I gave a
pep talk, versus my talk. And it worked, it worked, the — some of them started to
cry. They invited me every year, and — and that was the beginning. And then
schools asked me to make speeches. And depends on the audience, depends on the
people how much do I say of the bitter life I had. Depends on that. I do not say
everything. I say some. For instance, in Budapest, the soldiers took the women up

to the ho — office, to do office work, but that wasn’t office work. When they were
finding the second floor, third floor, five — fifth floor, it was two, three men raped
the women. Some didn’t come back at all, and the ones came back, I wish I couldn’t
come back. Bleeding, beaten up, black and blue. And that’s how they co — came
back. So this is — this is — this is a country occupation. It happens in every country.
But I wore the — I mean, I was so young, I wore a kerchief around my head, a black
kerchief, so I look ugly — not that I’m so beautiful, but I look ugly, and — and older,
and didn’t look anywhere like a — a retarded person I looked. I wanted to be — I
didn’t want to take — I mean, with due respect, I didn’t want to be taken.
Q: And this was all soldiers that were doing it?
A: Yes, Hungarians, and German.
Q: What about the Soviet soldiers, when they came? Did this continue?
A: We didn’t see sov — Soviet in the beginning. On the tail end, we did. We did.
Q: Were there also rapes?
A: I don’t know, really. But we were very close to the German and the Hungarian
soldiers. And that was — that was something which happened — I mean, watching the
countries, what happens in the country, and transporting human being, and selling
human beings, it happens all the time. But to me, that was the first one. That was
the first experience, when they — they — they — they transporting — they using human

beings. And to me that was a terrible thing. A terrible thing, which is unexcusable.
Here you make money on it. There wasn’t even money on it. It was coming to them.
And we were very lucky, because the was started four years ago. We were the last
country to be occupied. So we had only 11 months of the occupation, where four —
and then the other countries had three, four years.
Q: And something else I wanted to ask you about the war years, and the years
leading up, did you ever s — what was the ar — the Arrow Cross doing in Hungary”
The fa — the Hungarian Fascist party, I think it’s Nyilas?
A: Nyilas, yes, Nyilas.
Q: What were — what were they doing? Do you remember any specific incidents, or
A: Yes, I remember. First of all, they wear — they wore a feather in their hats. Why
is it important to me, because I — I — I was transferred to a — a big factory, at one
time, for a month or so, with Ella. And we were hiding in the gutter, and we saw the
feather, and then we just played dead. But that’s my af — incident. But they were a
little bit more educated than the average soldier. They were like teaching the
average soldier how to kill the Jews. And they were firm believer of the Germans
[indecipherable]. Firm believer, Nyilas. You — you’re free to mention that. It’s a
word you don’t want to be any connection with.

Q: So they — they were more feared —
A: Yes, yes. As I said, they were more educated than the average people. Educated
by the government, and then the Germans took over their education. And that
wasn’t an education like the five subjects. It was one subject; how to kill the Jews.
That’s what he wanted, a pure country. There is only white people, and Christian
people, and he — that’s what he wanted. Hitler.
Q: Did you hear any — any rumors about the Danube shootings, by the Arrow
Cross?
A: Yes. I don’t —I didn’t see it, but I was told that they tied their hands together in
the back, they tied their feet together, they — they — they pushed them into the water,
and then they shot them. And there are shoes on the [indecipherable] of —
children’s shoes, grown-up shoes, all shoes, because there were lot of, lot of
children there. How did they got away with it? In — in school, I used to sit at the
desk of the teacher — not sit on the desk, near the desk, and I saw the globe. And I
was playing with it, and then it occurred to me, nobody hears us, nobody sees us,
what’s going on. Not one person in the world would help us. Why? And the world
is big. And why we didn’t get any help? But of course, I never got the answer.
Q: And the shoes, you’re talking about the memorial?
A: Yes. Yeah.

Q: Did you hear anything else, specific about the Arrow Cross?
A: The what?
Q: Did you hear anything else specific about the Arrow Cross?
A: No. No.
Q: It was just they were don — you were almost afraid to say the word Nyilas, or —
A: I don’t hear you well.
Q: I guess you were — it was more of a general — you — you don’t even say the word
Nyilas. That’s how much it was —
A: No, no. No way, no way, no way. Unless you say, I love the Nyilas. That’s all
you were allowed to say. I mean, wouldn’t think about it. Wouldn’t think about it. I
mean, it was fire, you know? It was fire. Every house was injured, every person was
injured, an-and that’s why I left. I didn’t want to live there. And you hear, and heard
now, that I had a very difficult journey. Yet, I was told, go back, go back, aren’t you
homesick? No way. No way. The only thing I had there is my mother’s grave,
nothing else. I think we should end this com — this interview. Unless you have other
questions.
Q: I had one more, if that’s okay.
A: Okay, sure. Speak up.

Q: You mentioned that you and your aunt were 1n a brick fac — held in a brick
factory —
A: Yeah.
Q: — for a short time. Was this — was this after the stadium, and after the safe house?
A: Yes. After the safe house, after the stadium. Was before the marching, before th-
the ghetto.
Q: Before the ghetto.
A: Was between the same hou — safe house and the ghetto. We were there a few
weeks.
Q: And what — what were the conditions like in the brick factory?
A: I don’t remember, but I don’t even know what we did there. I don’t remember. I
mean, 70 years ago, you know. But I do remember that we have to find our own —
own transportation, and we were looking to stop a car or a bus or something. And
then I saw th-the feather, and then we played dead. Everybody knew about it, very
few people didn’t. You couldn’t ignore it.
Q: So [indecipherable] my — my last question 1s, is there anything we haven’t
talked about already, that you would like to add to the interview?
A: Nothing more what would help to understand my life. Little things, which
doesn’t mean anything. For instance, I went to that fruit stand, and while the guy

was back getting me fruit, I stole an egg, to take it to Grandma, and I put it in my
blouse. I went to Grandma, and she ran, Chirpy, Chirpy, and she hugged me, and
she broke the egg. But this is not a story, not part of a story which has any — any
factor in it, you know? And little things like that.
Q: So — and y — you think we covered everything that you would like to —
A: Yes, I do.
Q: — to add.
A: I really do. Thank you so much for y — for your patience, and your questions and
the way you conducted yourself up — you know, up to now, to meet, and I do
appreciate it.

A: You’re welcome.

A: Those are my parents; my mother and my father, from when — when they got
married, in 1926. They both of — both of them were taken away from me during the
war, and at the very early age, I became an orphan.
Q: Did you want us to get your phone, or are you okay?

Q: Okay, let me get one more shot of this.
A: This picture is from my beloved grandmother, who raised me after my mother
died, and I’m holding there my little doll. As you can see my face, I was very sad
because my mother was taken away from me.
Q: And how old do you think you were?
A: I think I was seven, eight years old. I was four when my mother died ... I was
eight or nine years old here, wearing the Hungarian national dress outfit. That was a
celebration, some sort of, and it’s a great honor to be in it. I know I was saying a
poem, and it was a great honor for me. Everyone was very proud. This picture was
taken way after the war, behind the Dohan Temple, which is the largest temple in
the eastern Europe. Every leaf is dedicated to someone who died there. When
people came back, before this was put up, they dug with your — their hands to find
relatives, siblings, children, but very few was — even pieces of the bodies. So they
put up this beautiful tree. The leaves are silver, and every leaf has a monogram.
