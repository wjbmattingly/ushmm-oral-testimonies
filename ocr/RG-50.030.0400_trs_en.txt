Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: I think to begin, if you coul
d just say your name  at birth. 
Answer: My name  at birth was Rachel Bielicka --

was the youngest in the fa mily, and 
my mother had five daughters.  
Q: And whe n were you born? 
A: 1922, December.  

Q: December? 

A: December 6. And my oldest si st

r than me. So when I was born, 
after a half a year, she we nt to study to Wa rsaw. 
And she established there 
and get ma rried there, 
and she lived in Wa rsaw. So my ot
her sister, Riva, when I was five
, she also went to Warsaw and 
established there and get ma rried 
there, finish school, and -- but 
we were [indecipherable] very 
open. They used to come  every vacation, and every 
holiday, as Passover, as Rosh Hashanah they 
used to come  home for a little while, and return 
also to Wa rsaw. For vacation when the kids were 
born, they se nd the kids to us, and we used to
 go together to a summer place, to spend the 
summer together. 

Q: Can you tell -- 

A: And my parents were businessmen who have
 a mill. And two little buildings at the place 
[indecipherable] that went to 
fight. We never changed the address before the war because we 
have there our own home and we live th
ere. When the war start in ™39 -- 
Q: B-Before we go there -- 

A: Yes?

Q: I just wanted to see if you coul
d tell us the name s of your parents? 
A: The name of my mot her was Minalaya, and th
e name  of my father was Benjamin. My father 
was 18 years older than my mother. My mother 
ma rried she was less than 18 in that time , you 
know?  And -- but they have a good relationship, a 
good life. And five children were born, and 

that™s it, and my daughter, my ol
der sister left Wa rsaw when I was ma ybe a half a year. And, 
successful there.  

Q: Do you know the name s of your gra
ndparents?  Did they live nearby? 
A: My grandparents? I never ha
ve grandparents. My grandmothe
r died when I was six months 
old, seven months old. My fa -- my m -- grandfat
her died before my mother was ma rried. And 
the parents of my father also died before he 
was married. So I don™t remember. The name of my 
mother, the ma iden na me was Apatova, Apatova. 

Q: And were your mother and father also from Wilna? 

A: Wilna, yes -- 
Q: Okay. 
A: -- yes. The fa mily of my father has a big farm
, as I know from the stories that my sister told 
me . Because you know, when you are 15 - 16, you don™t get in what happened between your 

parents and the grandparents. Wh
en you are a little child you are bus
y with school, with children, 
with friends. And when I meet my 
sisters from Warsaw, after 18 year
s that they also survived the 
war, they told me  stories about my
 pa rents, and they told me  that my fathe r™s family have a big 
far m, and they have 13 children. And from ev -- to 
every child they have tutors, especially. They 
didn™t go to school, at -- every child
 has a tutor. And in the family
 was a couple of rabbis, they 
were very educated because I reme mber my fath
er, he knew fluently Hebrew, he knew English, 
he knew very well ma th -- ma themat ics. When I have some  difficulty in school, he used to tell 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
3 
 
me , and in meanti me , all kind of stories, in spit
e that he was very busy with his business. My 
mother wasn™t working, she helped out a little bi
t my father, and then she took care of the tenants 
there, the --  the -- her buildings
. She was busy. She likes very much
 flowe r s, she has a beautiful 
garden of flowers that took a 
lot of her time , and took care of
 the children, who are still study, 
and that™s what is. And -- 

Q: What do you reme mb er about when you were grow
ing up about the role th
at religion played 
in your fami ly life? 

A: My father was religious, and he was als -- 
always going to the synagogue, I reme mber, very 

early in the morning and then in the evenings. A
nd it was a traditional hous
e, and the s -- all the 
holidays were celebrating in the 
house, and that -- and sisters 
with their husbands came from 
Warsaw, and it was so nice, the Passover, and th
e Shavuot and the Rosh Hashanah, and the -- all 
the holidays. And as I reme mber 
my sisters when they grew up, 
they were not religious, they 
were socialists, most of them. And that what it 
is. But when I was very small my sister went to 
study in Wa rsaw. Financially they we re not so good 
in that time  in my fa
mily, and my sister was 
very brilliant, she was a very
 capable person. And all of a su
dden she want to go to Warsaw 
when she finish high school, with also [indeciphera
ble] like here is A™s, and she find out that 
there was a new nursery school es
tablish in Wa rsaw from the Joint from the United St ates. And 
she said she wants to go to this school. 
And my mother was ag
ainst, she said,  
ﬂYou are such a capable person, why do you want to
 be a nurse? ﬂ She said, ﬁI decided.ﬂ She 
said, ﬁYou are afraid for blood, and 
you™ll be a nurse, working? ﬂ And she said yes. And she went 
to school. And that time in Warsaw through th
e school, they took all the 14 students. The 
director was sent for the -- from the school from
 t he United States. And th -- when she came to 
Warsaw she had all her ticket in one side. They sa
id, it™s full. They have the four student. She 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

said, ﬁBut I can™t go home , I don™t 
have a ti -- another ticket.ﬂ And 
they said -- her diploma was 
excellent, and they looked at her, they said, 
ﬁWait. Maybe one of them will change her mi nd, 
then you™ll take her place.ﬂ And after two days 
some body went out, and they
 put her in. And she 
finished the school, and it was ne
xt to the hospital, a Jewish ho
spital on Chista in Wa rsaw. And 
she finished the school, and then 
they send her to Paris to finish 
special  school for teachers, for -- 
to the nurses school, meaning that 
she™ll return and she™ll be in th
e -- between the teachers, the t -
- 

Q: The teaching staff. 

A: -- in the teaching st aff. And she fi nish the sc h
ool in Paris, very excellent and return to Poland 
and start to be an instructor in the same  school. 
And then the war start, and the director went to 
the USA for  funds or some thing, and she -- the dire
ctor of the school -- and there were dormitory 
in the school that the students came from all of Poland and from all over. In that time it was a 

Jewish nurses school. And she was very good, and th
e war start. And the war start, and lot of 
people start to come  to Wilna because you reme mb
er that there were a pa -- a pact between 
Molotov and Hitler and they divi ded Poland in tw
o, and Wilna get Russia and Warsaw start to be 
-- and the community was very bad, but in the ve
ry beginning, as soon as the Germans start to 
come  to Poland -- people from Poland run awa
y, and lots came  through Wilna. She couldn™t, 
because she was responsible for the chil -- the st
udents, they were 17 - 18 - 19 years gi rls who 
live there. She couldn™t leave them and run awa
y. That™s why she was staying in Poland, and my 

other sister also came to Warsaw to finish the 
nursery school where my si ster was director, and 
she was a nurse. And she didn™t want to leav
e her, so she was staying with her, so -- 
Q: What were their name s, those two sisters? 

A: One was Luba. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

Q: The oldest one was Luba? 
A: Luba. She was Luba Bielicka Blume. And th
e other was Ri va Kakanovich. And the war start, 
and there was in the beginning, the -- 

Q: But before we go to the war Rachel
, I just want to spend a little -- 
A: Yes? 

Q: -- more time . Can you tell us a little bit more
 about your father™s mill, and the business?  What 
was a regular day like?   

A: He used to wake up four in the morning, 
because when peasants were going from all the 
county to the ma rket, they used to leave their gr
ain and all the stuff to ma ke kasha and flour and 
everything in the very morning. And the -- my father knew them all and they -- he prepared the 

stuff. And they used to go to the ma rket, wh
ich was in the mi ddle of 
the city. About nine, 10 
o™clock, the m -- they sold their 
products, they returned and pick
 up the flour and then the kasha 
and whatever it was. And they used to go back 
to their county and during 
the day they have two 
people who helped him, and he was working in there. 

Q: We re the people who were bringing their goods
 to be milled, were they Jews and non-Jews? 
A: No, no, only non-Jews . 

Q: Non-Jews? 

A: Only non-Jews. They were the peasants who live
 in the periph -- periphery of the city, not in 
the mi ddle of the city, but a l
ittle bit behind. It was Wilna, but you know, in the suburb. And 
that™s what I reme mber, all the time  being bus
y and I was in school. I was in school. My school 
was not far from my house, it wa
s four or five miles, walki
ng every day to school. And my 
sisters too. And then I finish sixth grade of the 
beginning school and start to go to gymnasium, to 
the fi rst grade of gymnasium, until ‚39 when the Russians came, they changed the whole system 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
6 
 
of the schools because there was 10 - 11 grades and th
at™s all. And we were 
in the fourth year of 
gymnasium,  they make us the eight -- the eighth
 grade from 10 - 11 year school. And we have to 
start to learn in Russian, because ther
e was no Yiddish school any more. And -- 
Q: Can you talk a little b
it about -- you menti
oned how educated your father was. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And your two older sisters were going o
ff to study nursing and to become  teachers. 
A: My fi m -- yes, but my older sister , they finish gymnasium before it. 

Q: Right. 

A: To the school in Wa rsaw, to the nursing school in Wa rsaw they ha
ve to come  after high 
school. 

Q: But what was -- what did your mother and fath
er, what were their views about education and 
going on to study? 

A: My mother was all the time for education. 
My father said some tim
es, you know, why should 
you educate them so muc h?  They™ll be very edu
cated more than you are, they will leave you and 
they™ll went some where else, 
you™ll never see. And 
my mother said, no, they have to be 
educated. And my fa ther said, I am old, and who will take the business?  They have to stay home 

to ta -- my mother said no, they are too in
telligent to, and they want to go out.  
Q: Interesting. W- Wa s your fa
ther trying to get one of th
e younger daughters to learn the 
business? 

A: She wants some  of the son-in-laws, but they 
we re far away. My son -- my brother-in-law, the 
husband of Luba, was Abrasha Blume. They were 
dating in school, and then she went to Wa rsaw 
to study in the nursing school, and he went to ber
li -- to Belgium to study 
in the university. And 
they fee -- they dating during the 
vacation time, and when they finished school, he returned to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

Warsaw and they get ma rried. And during the Holocaust he was one of the leaders of the 
uprising -- of the Wa rsaw ghetto uprising in 
Wa rsaw. And he finish
 engineering, I don™t 
reme mber exactly the -- and it was hard for him to
 get a job, even that he finish excellent. And 
then they said, if you finish another year in Po
land, you™ll surely get the 
job as an engineer. And 
he finish another year in Poland, and he still coul
dn™t get a job in his field. He was a very nice 

person. And then he start to work in the 
Bund organization. You know
 what Bund is, it™s 
socialism, that time it was very high, and the war 
started. And my sister wa
s all the time in the 
school, and this whole hold her until the end of her life. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit about the relation, the 
sit -- th-the position of your fa mily in the 
community? Wa s your -- was your family involve
d in politics in any 
way?  Did your father 
[indecipherable] the synagogue? 

A: No. My father was 
involved in the synagogue. 
Q: In the synagogue?  [indecipherable] 
A: All the time  he was a [indecipherable] in 
the synagogue and -- in ou
r area, in our area. 
Q: What did that mean? 
A: In our area was a synagogue and he was a me mber
 and he was some  body of the oldest there. 
And as I reme mber all the time [indecipherable] 
synagogue, and the celebrat
ions of the holidays 
and -- but the children not. The children not and 
he let them go their way. Yeah, he didn™t presh. 
And I didn't know if it would help 
because there were other -- e-ev
ery sister of mi ne were very 
independent. I have two in Wilna, 
and the other two were in Warsaw. 
Q: Wa  -- wa -- ho-how do you explain that, th
at you were all such independent girls? 
A: They went to school, they belonged to all ki
nd of organizations, and wh
en they finished, they 
got good jobs, and they get ma rried, and they live 
in different cities, and my -- I have two other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
8 
 
sisters who were older than me . One was Sela
, she finished a -- a professional school ma king 
heads, you know?  And my other sister, Brina was f
our years older than me , a beautiful girl, and 
she finished a profession
al school, tailoring. 
Q: Can I just clarify, ma king heads?  Make -- 
A: Modistes -- 

Q: Wi gs?  

A: Sh -- how can I tell it in? Modi ska is -- she makes heads, special heads. Hats. 

Q: Hats, hats. 

A: Hats, I™m sorry, I am sorry. 

Q: I™m so -- okay, that™s okay. That™s 
okay, that™s -- that™s fine, that™s -- 
A: Hats, yes. 

Q: Oh, so you were the -- 

A: It was a profession in that time. 
Q: Right. You were the -- you were the baby? 
A: I was the baby, I was the very smallest from 
all. I told you, between me  and my sister was 18 
and a half years a di fference. 

Q: I didn™t know you we re the baby. 

A: I was the baby. 

Q: Huh. A-And can you speak some  about the friends
 that you had, or that your family had?  Did 
you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Or one or the other? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
9 
 
A: Yes, but mostly they were Jewish as I reme mb
er, in my fa mily. My sister from Wa rsaw has a 
lot of non-Jewish friends and my other, too, bu
t mostly the friends were Jewish. I want to 
explain, as I reme mber the times in Poland, for Je
wish people, Jewish youths, they don™t have a 
big field where to go. When they finish school, 
high school, they were bright people, and they 
couldn™t get governme nt position. They -- it was ver
y, very ha rd to get into university in that 
time, and they didn™t have where to
 go after school, only in a professi
onal school, like
 at a tailor, 
a tishler, a shoe -- shoema ker, a bookkeeper, a nurse
. Poland in that time start to be under the 
infl uence of the Germans, so anti-Semitism start to
 grow there, more than bi -- than right after 
the World War 
1
. So mostly the people -- it™s very litt
le, people who get doctors and lawyers, 
they™re very little bit from the ve
ry rich and who have connections, of course there are, but very 

little. Mostly the peppele -- population wasn™t so
 successful. That™s the truth, whatever they 
want. 

Q: Wa s that some thing that was und
erstood and spoken about in the time? 
A: Yes -- yes. 

Q: Ho-How would you -- how 
would you talk about it? 
A: They saw there were very 
bright people between them, and 
they want to get into the 
university. For example, I have a nephew, a -- a cousin, who was very bright, his name  was 

Tolchinski, Boris Tolchinski, and 
he finish a Polish high school, 
a very famous po -- and he want 
to get a doctor -- to be a doctor, 
and it was impos sible to get in uni
versity, in spite that his grades 
were excellent. And he came to my
 mother -- as I told you, they 
we have a mill, and the people 
will leave their grain in the morni
ng, and the end of the month, the boss of the farm came to us to 
pay for the whole mont h that hi s people use our 
mill. And his name  was Professor Zehofsky, he 
always -- was -- had the farm, and he was a professo
r in a university. And as
 my mother told me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
10 
 
about -- because I was small that when her nephew fi
nished and he was -- wants so much to be a 
doctor, he we nt to the farm. And th -- ma ke an appointme nt with this Professor Zehofsky is -- he 
knows her from the comi ng for years, for years with
 the account of his fa
rm. And she ask him if 
he could help to put him in to the -- the -- s
howing him that he finish a Polish gymnasium, a 
Polish high school, with excellent 
grades. And he is sleeping thi
nking about being a doctor, and 
he help him, and he get in, and he finish me dici
ne, yes. And he was in Poland so -- survived the 
war, and then he came to Canada, and worked as a doctor. 

Q: A-And the professor that -- 

A: It was my cousin. 

Q: -- your mother went to, to ask for help -- 

A: Professor Zehofsky. He was Polish. 

Q: He was Jewish, or non-Jewish? 

A: Polish. 
Q: Polish. 
A: He was not Jewish, he was Polish, but he 
was like a friend for us, after so ma ny yea r s, you 
know.  

Q: You said that anti-Semitism a -- as you grew older, you we re begi nning to be more aware of 

it, what -- was this some thing that was talked
 about ever, for instance at the dinner table?  
A: No, no. 

Q: Or did you ever hear your
 parents talk about it? 
A: No, no, no. For example, we have neighbors who 
lived in our house for as mu -- as long as I 
reme mber, and they were enough poor they work, 
and some times they didn™t have the money to 

pay rent, and my mother was waiting for mont
hs, for months until, you know, they -- their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
11 
 
situation improved, and then they paid off. Pe
ople who were -- norma lly who were like friends, 
specially the kids were playing 
together, and when we went to the ghetto, all our goods were -- 
we used to push to the neighbors, because we
 have only 15 mi nutes to go out from the  house. 
And we could take very little with us. We  t
hought the war will be ma ybe a couple of weeks we™ll 
return, and we™ll have better good -- be
tter goods. But it works out different. 
Q: What were the name s  of those neighbors? 
A: Leshchevska, Kachinska, Millefsky. 

Q: They were Polish. 

A: They were Polish --  

Q: Okay. 

A: -- Polish, yes. 

Q: So what you™re describing is 
a lot of pretty relaxed interac
tion between non-Jews and Jews -- 
A: Yes, yes -- 
Q: -- in Wilna. 
A: -- and then they were so very, very friendl
y between us in that time , before the war. 
Q: Do yo -- and can you speak a little b
it about what language was spoken at home? 
A: At home  I spoke Yiddish. And in the school 
in the beginning, I was in the -- in a Jewish 
Polish school. It was Jewish children, but the ma
in language was Polish, the first four years. And 
then I changed to a Jewish gymnasium, after th
e six years. And then 
I was starting gymnasium 
until the begi nning of the war, until it was destroye d. 

Q: A-And then you had to speak Russian? 

A: Russian I have to start to speak in 1939 when
 the -- when Poland was divided, and Wilna start 
Russian for a short time, and then they gave 
it to Lithuanian afte
r two mo nths. And it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
12 
 
Lithuanian. But in the first year s when it wa
s Lithuanian, the ma in language was Russian, 
because the population was not Lithuanian, the Lit
huanian was otherwise. 
Little by little they 
start to come  from the counties after the wa
r. After the war for a 
long time, Vilnius was 
Lithuanian but the ma in language was Russian. For 
a long time , and then they
 start to protest th-
that they want -- when they have enough people al
ready in Wilna, they came from all kinds of 
the counties, they start to
 talk Lithuanian, in the stores, in 
the banks, in that -- but before it was 
rush -- Russian. 

Q: What were the political belief
s of your fa mily?  We re they very
 clear to you as a young girl, or 
as you got older?   

A: I was mo stly under the influen
ce of my sisters, like socialists
. And my parents never was in 
their way, but my father was relig
ious. He was religious, and ma ybe 
he was upset a little bit that 
the children went out, but it 
was such a direction in that time in the Lithuanian. 
Q: And whe n you say that you were under the influen
ce of your sisters and 
they were socialists, 
what did that mean? 

A: They believed in working people. They belo
ng to organizations, I wer -- and the school was 
also a little bit in the left dir
ection. And they believed in Russia, 
in the Soviet Union, because we 
didn™t have any informa tion what
™s doing there. But the propaga
nda was so high. The people saw 
th -- especially for the Jewish people, they l
ook and study, they™ll be ab
le to study, they™ll be 
free, they will -- for example, I™ll tell you a stor
y. I was in my school, as I told you, it also was 
with a left direction, and when Russia gave Viln
ius up to the Lithuanian, they came with their 
propaganda to the schools, and ask the children if
 they want to study and have their freedom, 
they can go to Russia, to Byelorussia, to Ukrain
e. And they can study free, and they can became  
teachers and engineers and what, and they™ll have
 their freedom. A lot -- and who wants?  We  can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
13 
 
make lists, and tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, th
ey can leave. And lots of the older classes of 
the children, they scri bed themself in the lists. An
d they are going to Byelorussia to work, to -- to 
study, to the schools, and they -- and they left ve
ry warm and nice families. And left during the 
week to Russia. And weg -- they 
came there -- of course they came into the schools, to the 
university, one -- get the teacher th -- and they -- 
but they sa w the hard life of there. They saw 
that the reality is different. A
nd they didn™t have a way back. Th
ey couldn™t go back to their 
parent. And you know, children, they tried, that -- but they left their parents, their homes, and it 
was lot of them. And one 
of them was a sister of a good friend 
of mi ne. And they went after, and 
they start to study, of course they were hungry, th ey didn™t have what to wear, they have -- and 

they were home sick. And after a couple of months, 
or a half a year, they came  again with lists. 
Who wants to go to see their parent
s, to the -- of course lots of
 people said they want. And the 
sister of my friend also [indeci
pherable] she want to go to Wiln
a, back to see the parent. And 
they inst ead to send -- and after awhile, instead 
to send them back to Wilna, they send them to 
Siberia. A lot of them. And this
 girl, her name  wa s -- now she [i
ndecipherable] after the -- after 
the war she get ma rried. And she went there, and 
she was working very hard, and she was in the 

forest to cut the trees, and they
 gave her a little warm jacket
, and some  big shoes, and the 
[indecipherable] worked very, very hard, and 
we didn™t have any informa tion. One thing was 
good, the whole family was killed, and she was aliv
e. And she worked very
 hard, and in -- it was 
the -- the patriation fr om the -- the Polish ci tizens 
after the war. I think it was in ™47 - ™48 that 
they can return to Poland to get their Polish 
citizenship. She describe 
hersel f [i ndeci pherable] 
return to Poland and then she went to -- to [inde
cipherable] or some where, and finally she came  
to the United States. When I came to the United Stat
es in ™76, I met her, and she told me all the 
stories. Her fa mily was killed, and she was working the place I am worki ng now, and she

another three months. I was nervous, will I st ay at th
e job?  And the Yiddish st
art to be a little bit 
less, and nobody knows the Yiddish, only English. On
ly one person. Finally they -- I think that 
get -- they ge t used to my personality, and they
 accepted me . And during the years I learned, and 
they gave me  things that I don™t need too muc
h, the language like traki
ng -- taking track of the 
me mbership, or of the federation stuff, who wa
s - -  and they picked up, and meantime I learned, 
and I am there for 23 years. Still working, in sp
ite when I came  was 18 people at the staff, and 
now is seven, I am still within the seven, not knowing so well the language. But I doing other 
things that are enough important and th

able] religion. We  were
 Jewish, and we have 
Jewish schools, and we have Je
wish synagogues, and we have [i
ndecipherable] in that time in 
Poland. Other were very assimilated, likepeople before the World Wa r -- World Wa r  
1
, it was 
Russia, as you know. It was change
d in the politics in the country 
[indecipherable] in spite being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

in one city. And the -- for example, my mother spoke a lot of Russian. The parents of my friend 
Solami d, they came from Leningrad originally. An
d the -- at home  they speak only Russian. And 
the -- then it came Poland, and a 
lot of people spoke Polish. They
 were assimilated, and Polish 
was the ma in language of their home. But in my home  they spoke Yiddish. 

Q: S-So you™re describing it almost a -- a kind ofinsular quality that at some  point th-the city 

was Russian, then it was Polish, but you and your 
fa mily were -- were simp ly always Jewish? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit abou
t the years leading up to when 
Poland was divided, and -- was it 
some thing that you were expecting a -- you know -- 

A: When the war start in ™39? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was -- 

Q: So maybe ™37 - ™38. 
A: In ™37 - ™38 was a very big anti-Semitism in 
pole -- in Wilna in Poland. They were under the 
influence of Germans. For example, ev -- next to 
the Jewish stores -- there were a lot of Jewish 
stores, usually stayed the stude
nts -- the Polish students, they 
were calling [indecipherable] don™t 
buy in Jewish stores. They didn™t let in Polish 
people to get into the Jewish stores. In the 
university, some  Jewish people were in the univer
sity, and the students [ind
ecipherable] said the 
Polish people have to sit on their 
right side in the room, and the Je
wish on the left have to sit. 
The Jewish people never sit on the 
left, they were staying, listen 
the lectures, and ma ke the notes, 
staying. 
Q: Standing? 

A: Standing, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
17 
 
Q: Oh, as a form of protest? 
A: And -- as a for m of pr otest. And some times they
 start to beat up people when they see in the -
- the -- ™97 - ™98, it™s a very bi -- it
 was a very big fluence from Ger many. 
Q: ™37 and ™38? 

A: And -- yes, yes. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then in ™39, Poland was divided, and Wiln
a start to be Russian, and wars -- and Wa rsaw 
is Poland. And there were no [indecipherable] a
nd the -- a letter was 
going from there for 
months, three or four mo nths. And then when the 
start -- the war start for us, because my sister 
was in Warsaw, and I reme mber my mother was 
always try -- est -- 
crying, and people from 
Warsaw run away the first days, and as I said, my
 sister couldn™t becaus
e she was in charge of 
that school. And people from Wa rsaw who run aw
ay, lived in our house because every fa mily 
who was able took a couple of the -- of the pe
ople who run away [indeci
pherable] how they call 
here -- like the people who run 
from Bosnia now, or from --  
Q: Refugees? 

A: Refugees. Every fami ly who could took a couple
 of refugees in their home s. In my  home  
were refugees from Warsaw 
who knows my sister, and my 
s i ster was in Warsaw. We 
[indecipherable] once in three, f
our months, we got the letter. We
 send the package, they got it 
after four months, in the beginning. Other people 
were not killed, then 
they was -- it was a 
ghetto. And school where my sister works was on 
the territory of the ghetto, so the nursing 
school was still going on, and the Jewish people 
from the ghetto in Wa rsaw, the young girls have 
studied. Even the nurses from the school were take
n out of the ghetto for work to the hospital, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
18 
 
even to the German hospital. A
nd -- but -- but from -- for us, fo
r the fami ly it was war, because 
my mother was alway -- all the time  crying about he
r sist ers in Warsaw and 
their grandchildre --  
Q: For --  
A: -- about her daughters and the gr
andchildren, in spite -- in the -- ™39, in the beginning, before 
the war start, they were all in Wilna, at our 
summer house, and when their vacation finished they 

went -- the sister with the brothe
r-in-laws went to Wa rsaw, and th
e children was ver -- left with 
us. It was two children from my one sister, and one boy from the ot
her sister. And with the last 
trai n we send them back with the wome n to Wa
rs aw, thinking that the safest place would be 

Warsaw because the pr opaganda was very high in 
that time, that Poland is very strong, and she 
does -- she is not afraid for everybody. S -- so that
 capital, the Germans wi ll not come . And all of 
a sudden, it changed. And the ghetto was smaller, 
smaller, but people were not killed in that 
time. We know there was hunger, th
en there was -- there is no cl
othes, it was [indecipherable], 
and there were ne -- not enough place for them, bu
t they™re alive. And when the war start, the 
Germans came to Wilna , after the war start with
 Russia, we thought, okay, it will be like in 
Warsaw. Some  people run away, some  couldn™t.
 My fa mily didn™t run away, I don™t know why, 
but some  run away and had to return because 
Russia didn™t allow it in
 the beginning, to go in. 
They thought that we are spies, or what. They
 still don™t -- and you know -- but we said okay, 

we™ll survive the war, like in Wa
rsaw. In Wa rsaw they started k
illing later -- later on. As it start 
to be in all the countries. 

Q: Wa s there ever any discussion in your fa mily of sending people out? I 
mean far away, like to 
another country? 

A: We couldn™t. We couldn™t. First of all it was 
a lot of money, and it has 
to be relatives. You are 
thinking e -- before the war, yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
19 
 
Q: Yes, before, mm-hm. 
A: But you know, it was -- it was complicated, especi
ally from Wilna. Life was not bad there, 
and some  pe ople went to the Un
ited States, but very little.  
Q: Wh- Whe n do you reme mber first hearing about N
azism? Wa s this before the war?  Before -- 
A: Before the war, before the war. 

Q: C-Can you reme mber that? 

A: Before the war, when Hitler came to the power,after years, of course we have stor ies about 

anti-Semitism there, about -- even, I think, Kris
tallnacht [indecipherable]. We were ver -- very 
afraid if the Nazis will come , if
 Germany will come  here. And as soon as they hear that the war 
start, a lot of people run 
away to Russia. Luta™s family run aw
ay to rush -- and they went until 
Minsk, and they didn't allow them to go throughthe -- through the border. And they returned 

when the Germans were there, they returned li
ttle by little ba ck to their home s, because they 
couldn't go through, and then they we
nt through the whole ghetto, and -- 
Q: Let me  -- did you ever hear Hitler on the radi
o?  Do you reme mber hearing him on the radio? 
A: Hitler? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: No, no, I could -- I -- I don™t 
reme mber what we know. A lot was going on in the -- Germany. 
And we saw the situation in Poland like they st
art to be like Nazis. No
t everybody, but especially 
between the students, and -- 

Q: How do you explain that, that 
young people did it at first?  Stud
ents standing outside of shops, 
that -- that sounds so unusual. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
20 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Not the socialist, but
 they have to choose
 between the Russia and 
Germany, a nd they like better the ru -- Germa
n. They didn™t expect what will happen, you know? 
Then, when they lost the war ri
ght away, the situ
ation changed.  
Q: Wa s there ever any discussion in your fa mily as
 the war drew closer, or began, of -- of hiding 
people, perhaps even further out in
 -- in the countryside, or --  
A: But the Polish people were very afraid. They
 we re very scared, becau
se there were several 
situations that they show -- they hang th-thi s Po
le for hiding a Jew, or 
-- and they show it on the 
ma rket openly, the people saw it -- 

Q: In Wilna? 

A: -- and they were afraid, yeah. They were 
afraid. And then, when the people went to the 
ghetto, most of the people didn™t believe that it will be  for long. They said a couple weeks and 

the war will be ended. And all their goods they 
put to the Polish people,
 and then they didn't 
want to give it -- it back. So they were ha
ppy, others thought, oh, they were nice people, too. 
And I think if we would burn ev
erything what we have, that th
e people would be nicer to us. 
Secondly, I™ll tell you, when the Russians came, th
e Jews were happy. I™ll to -- I told you, they 
thought they™ll have finally thei
r freedom. They™ll can study, they
™ll can be like the -- all the 
people, like it was in the very be
ginning, in spite that the -- the s
ituation was hard to leave, that 
they were poorer or whatever. But they had a l
ittle bit their freedom in the very fa -- beginning. 
And -- and the Poles saw how they were happy with
 that. And the reality was different. After two 
or three years the politics changed there. Maybe 
that was the reason. But there were nice people 
also. I have  in our mill, when we went into the 
ghetto, for seven months or for a year, I worked 
on a farm five miles from our home , early befo
re the war. And we have a person who were 
working in our mill. He was a -- a bachelor and -- and he saw me once that I am going with a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
21 
 
[indecipherable] on the mi ddle of th
e street with another 200 peopl
e to the farm. For an hour, for 
an hour and a half we march until we  came to wo
rk, to nine o™clock. This person saw me  once 
and all of a sudden I see that he is going with 
a package behind our -- our group, and he is going 
for fi ve miles, until they -- they fi
nd a situation and they start to go 
to the end to talk to him. He 
was afraid, but he gave me  the package, bread 
with a bottle of milk, and disappeared. Every day 
until I worked there, this person, a Polish boy who wo
rked for us for a couple of years, did it. I 
would never expect that this pe
rson can be moved. It too -- 
Q: What was his name? 

A: Hi-His name  was Mironchik, but I don™t know the 
last name. I meet him after the war, he was 
still the same bachelor living wa -- in one of the rooms in our house, poor, of course. I came, I 

supported him, and then he came to me  in the e
nd, ma ybe a five years becau
se I left, he said, I 
want to get the -- to get a pension and I can™t 
get a pension because I don™t have enough years, 

but I worked for your father for 
a lot of years, ma ybe for 10 y
ears, but I don™t have anything 
from the m. Maybe you can come  and tell. And I came a
nd tell. I didn™t wa nt to tell that we were 
capitalists, that we have a store because [ind
ecipherable] it was not rich, we were very low 
mi ddle class because I ha ve a lot of -- you know. But I went and he said, he  worked for your 

father, your father had -- I said, 
yes, my father in that time wa
s sick and he couldn™t work by 
himself, and he took this person for -- and I reme mber him ve ry well. I want very much him to 

get the pension. And -- and I can guarantee that he
 work for the 10 years, and -- and he believed 
me , and he got the pension. I was 
happy that I can -- of 
course I gave him money, I gave what to 
wear after the war when my situ
ation was better. But, that I c
ould do by him this thing, because 
he was really a simple person, but he was -- he ha
d a heart. Can you imagine that in the ghetto he 
brought in a half a loaf of bread
 with a bottle of milk?  Maybe it
 saved the life during the hunger. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

It was not so easy to get in with it to the ghett
o, but some how I hide it in -- between my  pants, 
some how came, if I could. If I saw that some  
Germans had -- staying to the entrance -- to the 
entrance of the ghetto, we  can go around on the mi ddl
e of the [indecipherable] for hours until we 
saw that it™s cleared up and we can 
get in to put in the little thi
ng that we have, we worked on a 
garden, they gave us a little b
it carrots and potatoes and -- to put 
in some how hide it. And we can 
do it only if nobody works with -- only was a Jewi sh
 policeman at the entr
ance of the ghetto. So 
I s -- we saw there were Polish -- Polish, were lot 
of people. Luta will also tell you a story about 
the people who worked in her house for -- 
for ma ny years, and how they helped.  
Q: Okay, let™s stop now. 

A: We are a little -- 
End of Tape One 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Before we begin s-speaking about the change
s in the ghetto, can you tell us about your friend, 
who you call Luta, that™s her nick
name , but tell us her name , and then tell us how you first me t 
her. 

A: Luta™s name was Sulamit Shrey -- Shreyber. I 
was in one school with her brother Josef. Her 
brother was a class higher than me . We were the 
same  age, but he was a class before. In 1939 we 
were at the summer house in 
a place called Neme ncheny, and ther
e, the place we were, were 
three houses. In one lived Luta™s family, in on
e was -- in the second was the fa mily of my 
brother-in-law from Warsaw, and the third house 
was ours. And in that time , as I told you, the 
children and the grandchildren of 
my  mother and her children from
 Warsaw came and also stay 
with us at the hou -- summe r house. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
23 
 
Q: Luba? 
A: Luba and Riva, but when -- with their husba
nd. Well -- but when thei
r vacation finished and 
they have to return to Warsaw, the children we
re staying with us. And we were very friendly 
with the fa mily of Shreyber, with Luta™s fa mil
y. And her father was the director of a technical 
school, and my sister, being in the 
last year in high school, also t
ook courses in the technical. So 
her father knew very well my sister and my 
brother-in-law. And we were young people, and they 
were very friendly with her brot
he r. And she was a little girl in
 that time. She is fi ve years 
younger than me , was a very beautiful girl and we  a
ll like her, but I was friends with her brother, 
with Josef. And then the war star t, and with the la
st train we send the children to Wa rsaw to their 

parent, because my mo-mother believ
ed the children has to be with
 their parent, and that Wa rsaw 
was the safest place in Poland. And then the wa
r starts, and everybody went to their own place, 
and as there were the pact between Molotov and 
-- and Hitler and Poland 
was divide, Wilna start 
to be Russia, Lithuanian, and Wa rsaw was cut o
ff. And then we start a normal life. We were 
going back to school in ™39, and sa -- we very ha
ppy with us, as each ot he r, I start to date her 
brother, and we meet every even
ing in -- in school. And he was comi ng to our house, and I was 
going to their house, instead what 
we would live in different corn
ers of the city. And ‚99 was a 
very happy year, and before 1940, until ™41 when
 the war started in Russia and Germany. 
Q: When Wi lna was divided, when Wilna became part
 of Russia, what were the changes that you 
experienced?  Can you talk
 a little bit about 
that, in the city? 
A: Yes. First of all, they t
ook out the property of the rich pe
ople. And then everybody start to 
work, to find some thing -- work. The ch -- they ma ke
 changes in the school 
system, as I told you, 
this was gymnasium, and al -- they ma ke 10 - 
11 classes, and that™s it. Everybody -- everything 
start to be in Russian, Russian -- Russian wa
s the ma in language, with a little bit Yiddish, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
24 
 
because it was hard to go through. There was no an
ti-Semitics, there was -- the people were very 
nice there, one who came in the beginning, but you 
saw that they were -- they didn't know the -- 
the life that we have before in Poland. The 
soldiers, everybody who ca me from Russia, they 
empty out right away all the stores. In the begi
nning, the owners of the store was happy because 
before business wasn™t going so well. And th
en, all of a sudden 
people start to buy -- buy 
everything. They bought nightgowns and went to th
e [indecipherable] in them, and th-the -- the 
wifes of the soldiers, of the officers who ca me  
to Wilna. And -- but then they saw that okay, 
they™re buying everything, but they don™t have wh
ere to buy new stuff, to hold the business. So 
they were a little bit scary. And then, after awhile
, they start to pick up the rich people, send to 
Siberia. And they organized the youth to help th
em, the [indecipherable] a
nd there were a lot of 
Jewish people also involved with the [indecipherabl
e] that they didn™t know
, they believed them. 
And they were very upset. They took them to ho
mes, and told the people to pack -- pack bag, 
they™re going on -- on the tracks to the trains 
and they™re going some where to rau -- to -- to 
Siberia, to Russia, and -- and people were ups
et, why, what?  But finally it was good for them 

because the one they took out, they survive the 
war, and the one who stayed got killed, mostly. 
Most of them were killed by the Germans. But 
in -- the time being, it was horribl e. People who 
were not rich, they had a little store ma ybe, they su
ffered for surviving with the little store, all of 
a sudden they get the [indecipherable] they get -- ri
ch people they have to go out, Capitalists they 
have to go out of the city. And they send them 
far  away, deep in Russia, and it was very sad. 
Q: Wh- Wha  -- was your fa mily afraid that
 you would be labeled rich afterwards? 

A: Yes, yes. But they didn™t touc h us. We  were 
not enough rich to -- we have the mill, we have 
the house, but we were -- you know, have a lot of loans to pay, so we have problems. And all of -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
25 
 
- all of the family start to work -- to work, 
you know, hard. My sisters, 
and -- and I was study in 
school. 
Q: But you continued to go to school? 

A: Yes, until the war started between Russia 
and Germany when they cut off the schools and 
everythi ng. And I was dating Jose f all this time
, we were very good friends, and the families 
were friends. 

Q: Tell us a little bit about him.  

A: He was a brilliant student. She was a very go
od person, he was intelligent and an aristocrat. I 
was very in love with [indecipherable]. And we
 were study in school, we
re meeting inschool, 
and after school he used to take me  home . And 
then in the evening we me e t  aga -- again, we 
never have enough of each other. And we were 
good friends, and when we came into the ghetto, 
or to the ghetto later -- the fi rst year was quiet
, and then I was working in a farm. Before I 
worked in Judenrat, do some thing, and they want 
to go out from the ghetto, it™s very hard for to 
stay all the time . And I went to work for a farm 
and he went to work, to Gestapo. On the ho -- on 
the yard of Gestapo, doing all kind of cleaning some
thing -- he was very capable, so he did for 

them in the -- in their workshop some thing, in 
the -- I don™t know what. 
And it start to build up 
in the ghetto, Wilna pa
rtisan organization.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Before it was organized, it t
ook a little time in the ghetto, a
nd then the youth people of all 
organizations, Zionist, and Bundi
st and communist, who belongs to the youth organization 
[indecipherable] young people, and relig
ious, and they get together a
nd they start to think how to 
fight, what to do. Not to go like -- they saw th
e people disappear, disappeared from the ghetto, 
and before the ghetto and they didn
™t return. And they st
art to think about organize some thing in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
26 
 
the ghetto, and whoever works outside the ghetto, wh
erever they have a situation to bring in 
some  weapons, to -- to have some thing, in case. 
And he worked in the [indecipherable] of the 
Gestapo, and some how he had the possibility to ta
ke from them some thi ng. And he -- it was very 
dangerous I reme mber, until I saw him again co
mi ng from work, from 
out the ghetto, knowing 
that he is carrying some thing. I was very, ve
ry scared. And [indeciph
erable] organization.  
Q: Mm-hm. [indecipherable] to th
e -- to the ghetto, can 
-- can you tell us -- it was established in 
the fall of ™41, correct? 
A: Yes, the fall ™41, or the begi
 -- yes, on the beginning of ™42. 

Q: So the months before that, what was going on?  Let™s say the spring and the summer before, 

how were things changing? 

A: I will st art with the beginning order -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- of the ge -- how it come  to the ghetto befo
re. After a -- as soon as the Germans came  into 
Wilna, they surround themselves with the [i
ndecipherable] of the 
population. And what do I 
mean? The thieves, the bandits, the -- the one in 
the -- in every yard has a -- a cleaning person or 
were -- who were different, some  we re good and 
some  were bad. But it was the bad people they 
surround. Because how they knew who is a Jew, a
nd who not. I for example was blonde, and the 
blue eyes in the beginning and 
who could tell?  If the person who saw me  or knew me , t hat was 
just [indecipherable]. Aft e r a week they start to
 catch me n on the street. 
Men -- they ever saw a 
ma n, and they said he is Jewish, they catched h
im to a party, and put a party of 150 people, and 
they disa ppeared. And they said 
to take with them a towel and 
a piece of soap. Later on I™ll tell 
you, I find out after the war for what it was. And 
people start disap -- th
e me n start disappearing. 
Or they ring in an apartment, if a man opened th
e door, he may be in slippers, he ma y be without

a shirt. They gave him a [indecipherable] they ca
me  over with three or five people to a door, and 
get him out -- out to the street, 
and they disappeared. Before that
, a week after the Germans came 
in -- five days after they came in, 
they find out who are the leader --
 the Je wish leaders of the si -
- because what did the population -- what do th
ey know, the whole population?  They are living 
their normal life and that™s it. But ther e were l
eaders who had big positio
ns, who had -- can say a 
word to governme nt about their people, who canstand up from the -- the 
first thing they came, 
they picked up 60 fa mous people and they shot
 them right away. Wa s 
several people of my 
friends. So there were nobody to tell the world wh
at -- wh-what happened to the Jews, get th-the 
fa mous people who -- like fa mous doctors or famous lawyers, or famous politicians. And there 
were a lot because this was a big Jewish co
mmunity. Wilna, who had in that time 400 -- 250 
population, 74 of the population were
 Jewish. It means a third 
of the population are Jewish 
people. 

Q: H-How did you hear a
bout that, the leaders? 
A: I knew it, I knew it. Ri ght away people knew. 

Q: You did? 

A: Of course. It was a Dr . Ragovski, and Ailitch 
and Kaplan Gablanksi, it
 was fa mous  people in 
the [indecipherable] who always stand up for the 
Jewish people and have connections with the 
governme nt. There were even people who were in
 the same . And they disappeared, they were 
shot. So the population get with less people, and 
le -- and without leader
s. Then, after three 
weeks, it was a rumor that in the Jewi sh center 
of the city, there was a Jewi sh center, a small 
street s, with big buildings in a 
yard, ma ybe with four buildings, not
 the rich people, we re Jewish 
peop -- it the Jewish center. Most of the Jewish 
people were living there, all the -- the cleaning 
people were not the Jewish [indeciph
erable]. And all of a sudden it was a rumor that in that area 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
28 
 
a German was shot. And in one night they came in and they cleaned up everybody from the area. 
It was about six, 7,000 people. And they ma de it so
 fast, right from the bat on the street. They 
could be in the nightgowns, it was out sleeper 
[indecipherable]. A lot of people came from the 
bandit, fr om the soldier, Lit
huanian, Germans we re, and they 
throw it out the mi ddle of the 
street, and when all the area was empty up, they we
nt out and they took them to Pona ry. Ponary 
was a beautiful forest behind Wilna, and they shot them. Afte r a week, they established a ghetto. 

They were going from al l areas of the city, it 
was five boroughs, and going from home to home. 
Put them everybody on the street, and they were 
driven to the ghetto. For example, into our 
house, my father, before that, was taken -- we
 called them the harponi. They catched, they 
harped ma ns, and he was taken to such a party with the me n, and he was an old ma n, he was in 

the -- in that time 67 years old. But my mother, 
she was very energetic, she was going after them 
and asking, and -- let him go back, let him go back, 
he™s an old ma n, wha t  do you want to -- and 
fi nally they let him go back. After that , it was establish a camp -- a fi ve miles after our area 
where we lived, for turf, work with the turf, 
you know what™s turf?  Turf is earth, and they 
worked it up. And then it was like to
 heat the ovens 
like coal, like -- 
Q: Limestone? 
A: Stuff for heating up, 
it was coal, coal -- 
Q: Okay, okay. 

A: -- [indecipherable] in English also. And it was 
establish such a camp, so -- and my father and 
my brother-in-law was taken to this camp, th
e -- it was behind [indecipherable] it was called 
Rasha. And they were working a lot of people 
at that, three, 400 pe
ople were working on the 
camp in the Rasha. So when -- when we were driv
en to the ghetto, my father and my brother-in-
law wasn™t there. But it was as I remember, my si
ster lived -- has an apartment in our yard, in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
29 
 
other building, with a little child of two years. And in our 
home  I was wi th my mother with 
another sister. And it was about three o™clock 
at night, and all of a sudden we heard that 
some body is  knocking in the door. And seven, eight
 people; one soldie
r, one German, one 
Lithuanian, some  other people, fi
rst -- first we have you in 50 
mi nutes you have to go, take 
whatever you have -- can took in your hand, and go 
out to the street. We  -- the only thing was we 
did in the 50 mi nutes, th
at the best things were put to our
 neighbors. And my sister took the 
child, she took the wagon of the child, she put in
 the wagon whatever and the child and we put 
some -- it was September, it was hot. We even
 didn't think about the winter, and we took 
whatever we had, other things we hide and th
en some  were in the baseme nt, some  we re 
[indecipherable] and we we
nt out to the street. 
Q: Let me just stop you there. From the time 
they knocked on the door, can you des -- describe 
even in more detail who did what, was your moth
er in charge, who ran next to the neighbor, 
what did you give them?   
A: My mother and my sister would give us our
 line and our dresses,
 our winter coats out, 
whatever we can took from the cl
oset [indecipherable] and to the 
-- especially to 
[indecipherable] 
she wi -- she was living there for 20 years. So th
en they went -- so we came  into the ghetto. 
Q: So how did you get there, did you walk? 
A: We  walk. We  walked in the mi ddle of the stre
et, the whole part until 
the end of the street, it 
was a long street. And they were go -- when I ca
me  in, lots of people were staying with the -- 
their packages, with the children, with the -- 
waiting until everybody will go out. And then when 
they empty out all the houses, nobody can be leav
ed -- left in the house, there were too ma ny. 
And we went to the ghetto. And from different 
boroughs in the same  day, they bring the people 
to the ghetto. And we came in, we fi nd -- me and my
 mother and my sister and my little nephew, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
30 
 
my second sister, we came  to a yard who my sch
ool was. And we find a corner in a little room, 
because it wa s lots, lots of peopl
e. And th -- in a room who was one person or a -- maybe 20 - 25 
people, everybody has a little corner
, a little mi ddle to -- to sit dow
n. And after awhile it starts 
then -- it star ts to or ganize stores, little -- for peop
le to give that -- to have some  cards that we 
can have some  bread, some  butter. It was 
organized before, potatoes they give us 
[indecipherable] can be, some how to survive. An
d they start to organize groups to go out for 
work on some  places where the soldiers are, on gardens, on some  plants, on some  -- some where 

to work and people went out -- some  were work
ing inside the ghetto from the very beginning. 
After ma ybe three weeks in th
e ghetto, it was Yom Kippur or ma ybe after a month. Al l of a 
sudden were rumors in ghetto, that
 this night the Germans wi ll ke
 -- come  for people. And they 
ma ke all kinds of lists, and the lists were done in 
my area where I lived and my sister has a friend 
who were a Jewish policeman in the ghetto, and he
 s -- and some how she fi
nd out that I were in 
the lists. So she said, what should I do?  She sa i
d, I will cross her out. But 
better that she will not 
stay at home, because they were ta -- they will
 take people from this area in ta -- in case they 
didn™t have enough, they can take from the one who 
are close [indecipherable]. And I went to my 
boyfriend, to meet Luta. She lived in Shtrashona
 too -- Shtrashona, I don™t reme mber exactly the 
number, but it was a yard and four big buildings. 
And in every building, in every apartment, who 
normally lived a family of three 
or five, lived 40. in one part. And the Germans ca me  i n the 
mi ddle of the night, it was Yom Ki
ppur, it was raining, it was col
d, it was terrible conditions, 
people were sleeping, everything 
was going on in the mi ddle of the night. And they didn™t go to 
the area they promised, they didn't look at a list
, they came to one street, where my boyfriend and 
I was hiding and they surrounded 
two big buildings. In every yard
 was four big buildings. And 
they picked up the people and th
ey took them everybo -- I reme mber
 they came to my -- to our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

apartment and Luta™s father said, should we 
take some  food, s o -- some  thing, some  food. You 
want you can take, you don™t want you can take, 
you can take a piece of br ead, was strange. And 
they took us out to the main street of the ghett
o, Rudnitska. And Luta, she 
was all the time out of 
the ghetto, but this time she came to the ghetto for 
awhile. She was 13 years old in that time . And 
we came to Rudnitska, a lot of people were stay
ing already, driven out from the house, and we 
were staying in the party, and Luta start, sh
e was -- they f -- and the father said, ﬁYou young, you 
will be taken to work, I don™t know about us, butﬂ
 -- she said, ﬁNo, we™re -- all will be  killed. 
They are taki ng us to kill there.ﬂ And she start 
-- and her mother was scared from her shouting 
up. And the mother knew perfect German. And in ch
arge of the whole -- of the whole German, 
the people who took care of the whole party was in
 black -- in a black suit with a swastika 
[indecipherable] head with the -- with the -- 

Q: Hat? 

A: -- all kind of the signs. And she went to hi
m and she says, my husband is an engineer, and my 
husband lives in the Judenrat, let him out, where 
are you taking us?  And he pushed us away. She 
went a second time to him, let us go, my hus
band is an engineer, my husband works for the 
Judenrat, my husband did this and my husband [i
ndecipherable]. Let us go home . He pushed us 
again. She went five time s, and the Lithuanian
 soldier came and gave her a push and she fall 

down and then she came back to us and she said, 
is nothing I can do, or 
they don™t listen to me , 
what should we do?  And we were 
staying upset, prepared to go with
 all the [indecipherable]. All 
of a sudden, the German in the black, who was in 
charge of the whole a --
 goes through the older 
group of the people, said, ﬁ Where is the fraufrom Judenrat?ﬂ [indecipherable]. ﬁWho i s  the 

woma n from the Judenrat?ﬂ One person came, he 
said, ﬁNo it™s not you.ﬂ Then another person, 
no it™s not you. And we were stay
ing not thinking about anything, and he came , ﬁYou,ﬂ  to her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
32 
 
mother. ﬁTake your fami ly and stay next to me
.ﬂ We took our fa mily, and some  other people 
came like they are the family, and we were stayi
ng next to him, and the Lithuanian soldier don™t 
want us to stay next to him, and they pushed us
 again. And -- and we tried 
to stay next to him, 
and they pu -- then th -- he said
 to them, ﬁLet them -- let them
 stay, don™t touch them. And he go 
after me  and he went unti -- we went with hi
m until the end of the whole group of people. And 
we saw that he was counting, one, two, three, 
four, 900 -- 900 -- 998, and he give a short ma rk 
with the hand, go forward with the whole group 
surround by all the [indecipherable]. And to us 
he said, ﬁYou can go home, you are saved.ﬂ It 
was ma ybe five o™clock in the morning, 5:30, it 
was dark, it was raining, we were wet. And a
ll the soldiers are looking, how come  your -- you 
understand, the Germans are a very a
ccurate. If they have to take
 998 people, they™ll never take 
999. They™ll take 998 like they were told. And 
it was a little bit more, and maybe the mother 
came to his mi nd that she was bothering him, bot
hering him, said ah, anyway, some  people has 
to be left, let the woma n with the family be 
left. Some how it came to his mi nd. No explanation. I 
am sure, instead of us went some body else, because he needed the amount of the people. So we -
- and another ma ybe 10 were left over. They have
 more as they need. And we came back -- we 
didn™t go back right away, we went to our baseme
nt, we were trembling all, and we were downs 
-- and it was raining very much, we went to 
the first baseme nt and hide, and everybody was 
looking at us. And we came back to our place we 
lived. The light were on, all the apartment were 
empty from the two yards, from the eight big bu
ildings, w-we are the only one who return from 
it. And when we came back in the morning I sa w 
my fa mily, my mother and my sister, with the 
child of her hand, crying. That th
ey know -- they knew that I went
 there to sleep over, and they 
knew that people from there were se
nt  to the -- they all were sent 
to Ponar and Vers
hat. And after 
the war when I go -- went to Ponar, I saw the pl
ace there was -- they were shot, and they fen -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
33 
 
find out who they were because after the war peop
le take out this and they saw this or this 
skeletons, and that. Wh y, when they picked up th
e ma ns on the st -- the ma n on the street, and 
the ma n from the houses, why did they tell them 
to take a towel and soap?  When they bore them 
to Ponary, to the forest where they killed them
, they ma de a big hole, and put a disk over the 
hole. And the people -- the ma n were
 a little bit far away. One after 
the other, and they have to 
binch their eyes. And one by one they put them to this hole, through -- when they came  to the 
disk, they shot them, and they fall to their hole. 
In one side or the other where they shot until the 
end, or half alive. Nobody came from there bac k, you know [indecipherable]. But this -- this way 

they told them to take a towel and a pi ece of
 soap, not to under -- the pi ece of soap not 
understand and the towel to be in their eyes, not to
 see the last mo ment of their death. You have 
one, I told you that an accident. 
I could be [indecipherable] what come  to his mi nd, to save this 
woma n with her family, I don™t know.  

Q: At that point what did -- how di
d people understand what was happening? 
A: They didn™t -- 

Q: Did you understand that -- that
 -- that you were taken -- 
A: They didn™t know, they said they are take
n to a camp for work. They are -- were lying 
terrible, people -- later on peopl
e understood, and I™ll te
ll you a little bit late
r about it. Otherwise 
it finished. In that time, my mother was hiding so
me where, and they didn™t find her. No, in this 
time they di -- she di dn™t hide, because they pi ck
ed up the two buildings and this area where my 
mother was, they didn™t -- they didn™t touch a
nybody from there. But afte
r awhile was another -- 
another story. It went another two months qui
et, people were working, 
people were eating, the 
young people were laughing, you know it -- you -- you -- 
young people, they want to live. There 
were secret schools where the young people were edu
cated. About Luta™s fath
er she™ll tell he -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
34 
 
you by herself, how he organized a school for st
udents, for people to -- to learn some thing. 
Young people they ha ve what to do. And it was so 
-- everything secretly because th-the Germans 
didn™t want people to -- to learn, 
to study, to -- they want only to work, whatever they could, not 
to -- and the Jewish people want to study, they wa
nt to learn. They want 
to like literature and the 
-- them -- organize the [indecipherabl
e]. Th -- they di -- they want 
to live. But about her father, 
you™re a -- she will tell you hers-herself. There 
was another -- another action. We  call it action 
when there were rumors that the Germans are 
comi ng for people. All of a sudden they find out 
that people who are working have to have pink ce
rtificates. And the pink 
certificates were given 
at the work where the people -- at the work
ing place where the people worked. Like my 
boyfriend worked in Gestapo, he got such a schei
n. They were -- called it a schein, a pink schein. 
Some people from the ghetto who worked in the 
ghetto in Judenrat have
 so -- pink schein. And 
these pink scheins were [indecipherable]. And the 
person with a pink schein can des-describe to 
him a wife a nd children before 16. My boyfriend jo
 -- Josef has such a schein, and he want to 
describe me  as his wife. But we lived together
 with -- with his cousin, a woma n who wa s more 
than 30. And then his father ask him, you know what, Rochola is so young, she can go with my 

daughter of 16, but Dina is old, and she can™t 
go with my [indecipherable]. Can™t you describe 
Dina as your wife?  And I will desc ribe  Rochol
a as my daughter, because he also has a pink 
schein from the Judenrat. 

Q: Rochola was your nickname ?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: In Yiddish they called me  Rochola. 

Q: Rochola, okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
35 
 
A: Yeah. And then [indecipherable] 17, I was st
ill Rochola, lot of people called me  until now 
Rochola. My other sister was de
scribed to another person as -- as
 his wife and my ot her sister 
also find a guy who describe her as her wife. 
Q: So people were essentially sort of listing fr
iends or relatives as their wi ves and children? 
A: Y-Yeah -- not -- not that. 

Q: To keep them safe? 

A: You know, some  people has -- had pink sche
in and they didn't have anybody, they were 
bachelor s, or  what. So if they know each other, th
ey describe them as a wife, and went out with 
them as a wife. My mother didn™t have such a 
-- and she -- she didn™t ha
ve a hiding place, and 
she was still in the ghetto. And my s i ster was 
with her all the time looking, something for her. 
And she left her of five mi nutes, she has to 
go to some body, ask if they have for her a hiding 
place. And my mother saw that she is -- my sister  will not leave her al one, and she was 

[indecipherable] what should she do. And she has in
 her pocket a couple of da -- of rubles, of 
money. She said, I have to meet her in five 
mi nut es, but I™ll try to go to the exit. Maybe 
some how I will go out [i ndecipherable]. And she 
went to the exit -- no, I™l
l tell you about -- later 
how she went out. My sister returned to the pl ace 
where my mother has to 
meet her, my mother 
didn™t return. She come  t o there, where is my 
mo -- I can™t find the mother. And she was crying 
and I was crying and we™re looking for my moth
er, my mother disappeared. We  went to the 
working place, and to the places where they put us
. They put us to the other ghetto, before it was 
two ghettos, from one side of the street and from
 the other, and all of 
a sudden they liquidated 
one ghetto. And they put them to the Ponar
y. And in that ghetto they liquidated the 
[indecipherable] and the people fr
om the ghetto out, some where out to the places where they™re 
working and some  were to the second ghetto wa 
-- what was empty out, for the couple of days. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
36 
 
And I was wer -- crying. My mother wi -- I didn'
t know where she is, she was killed, she was 
shot, or -- all the three day -- three days we we
re in the ot her place. My friend Josef was working 
for the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] y
eah, doing all kind of -- of hard work. And he 
has a Polish woman who worked in their house for 
40 years. And she used to come  to him where 
he worked, every day. And he went out -- we we re
 in the second ghetto, and he went out for the 
w-work every day. And he knew how I was crying 
and he told Vera, the woma n, wha t  happened 
to my mother, and the -- and th
ey don™t know where she is, and 
Rochola is crying all the time. 
She said, ﬁYou know what, I™ll go to the place 
where she was living before the war, ma ybe 

some how she went out of here.ﬂ She went to th
e place when -- where I lived, and she find a letter 
from my mother,that she gave 
some money to the policeman and 
he let her out. She took out her 
stars, and she went out the place to the camp my  
father and my brother-in-law was all -- almost 
working at the [indecipherable]. And she went 
by our house where we lived before, and she -- 
she saw that we will be concerned, and she left  a le
tter that  she™ s safe and she went to my father. 
And this woma n, Vera, risk of her life, and sh
e went there -- she we
nt -- and next day she 
brought my boyfriend Josef the le
tter from my mother, and he 
brought it in the second ghetto, 
and telling that my ma ma is alive and she is
 together with my  father on to -- in the 
[indecipherable]. We  returned after 
awhile to the ghetto to fi nd that lots of, lots of people were 
taken out. They said that they take
 that -- took them to work. They sa
id that they -- they are alive. 
But some how thoughts came  in that people who are 
alive, they ma y be s u
rround with the -- with 
the worst enemies, but somehow one of the thou
sands, thousands of people can find a connection 
and send some thing to the relatives
, a sign that they are alive. If
 such signs doesn™t come from 
anybody, it means that they are not a
live. But people, they don™t belie
ve in this, they™ll believe in 
life. They said, ma ybe, ma ybe they are working 
like we, they are some where, they are surround 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
37 
 
by the soldiers, they can™t send anything. And they
 -- you know, they think that they are killed, 
but in the underground they said 
that they are still alive and th
ey can™t believe that people can 
kill people. For what? We were in the ghetto 
another year, and it was all kind of feelings, 
feelings. A couple of people worked for a plant so
me where. All of a sudden we heard they didn™t 
return from work. They took them out to the yard and shot them, couple of hundred people. A 
couple of hundred people worked some where in B
ilavarka around Wilna, also
 in turf, and they 
disappeared, they didn™t return home after work to
 the ghetto, they were killed. They said they 
send them to another camp, but no, they were k
illed. One time it were ma ybe a -- of -- over two 
years, or a year and three quarter
s living in the ghetto, there were 
rumors that all the people from 
the -- from the shtetla -- from the towns that 
surround Wilna were bringing to the Wilna ghetto. 

And from the Wilna ghetto they are going to K
ovno, it was a city in Lithuanian, to build a big 
plant, a bi g factory. And people came from th
e -- you know, from the little towns around Wilna 
and they looked good, and they were -- were good dressed ye t, and they came with all families, 
with the old and with the sick and with the l
ittle children. They were about four and a half 
thousand people, and they all came 
to the ghetto. And they made a 
lot of friends they were study 
in the school, because our gymnasium was the only one in Poland with the Yiddish language, 

who had right for comi ng in after finishing to 
go to the university. So 
from all Poland, people 
used to come  to our school. And some  of thes
e people from the shtetla were in school, I knew 

them and they looked well, because you know, in the 
little shtetla they are 
[indecipherable] air is 
good, and th -- and they were for a 
week in the ghetto, and -- and 
they were [indecipherable] and 
we saw that, and after a week they said that th
e trains are ready and th
ey are going to Kovno to 
the -- to view the factory. And everybody was going 
by themself without things. They are going 
to build a plant. They went to the wagons [inde
cipherable] with their kids and older people and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
38 
 
the -- and the sick and all kind, 
and when they all get in, they
 thought that the wagons were 
[indecipherable] they were closed with not to ge
t out. They said why are they bombing the -- the 
trains?  The wagons that we ge 
-- we are going by ourself. We  are told to go and we are going, 
why should we be closed?  And they were chec -- they were watching, and a lot of people, young 
people, they know the area. Th
ey know how to go to Kovno. A
nd -- and they thought all of a 
sudden they are going to the forest
 from Ponar. So it was clear of them that they were not going 
to by -- but they were -- are going to shot them. 
Then they broke the windows of the going train, 
and they start to jump through the windows, whoe
ver could, all over the forest. As soon as the 
Germans and the Nazi they saw it, they start to 
shot. And the whole forest was shot with dead 
people. Very little could run out and survive, ve
ry little. Mostly they we
re shot. And the whole 
forest were with the dead, shot people. So tomo
rrow they came to the ghetto and they told the 

story, the German. And they asks Gens, Gens was 
in charge of the ghetto, to give him me n to 
clean up the forest. They were afraid to show th
e other people what they did. So they want the 
people and they guaranteed Gens. And Gens -- y
ou know who Gens was, yeah, had a big power. 
So the German. And he guara
ntee that the people -- 
Q: Jacob Gens. 

A: What? 

Q: Jacob Gens. 

A: Yeah, Jacob Gens. And they guaranteed that 
the people who did the work of cleaning up the 
forest will return, that they will not be shot. But [indecipherabl e] these people were the 

[indecipherable] who we re taken to clean up th
e [indecipherable]. He came back. He  promi -- 
that what he promised, he did, the people came bac
k. They were all -- they find a lot of friends. 
They told them to pick up of the dead peopl
e the teeth, the golden teeth, the jewelry, the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

whatever they can. If they have 
good shoes, the shoes, da, da, da
. It was terrible, and put into 
them [indecipherable] dead [indecipherable] 
half dead [indecipherable] you know. And it was 
4000 people, and to put them to the holes, to put 
with the -- all kinds of stuff to burn. And when 
the people came  back, some  were crazy, they co
uldn™t [indecipherable] a
nd they told the real 
story. And that™s what the story 
is, we find out what is Ponary, 
and where all the people were 
gone. When I came back from the concentration camp, the first thing I went to was 

[indecipherable] to the Ponary, and I find out a
ll the places where was the this, the --  the man 
who were, the beginning of the war taken from th
e city, and this people
, and the other people, 
and from [indecipherable] night where we were 
inside. And the childrenall of a sudden they 
picked up all the children until 16 years, and they put them in big trucks, and the kids didn™t 

know, they even were singing on the trucks, they 
are taking them to a camp for a co -- a couple 
of months. And they took them to 
Ponary and they sho -- shot them. It helped me  out of a -- to 
save Luta one time. I™ll tol -- te
ll you another story when we got
 to the camp. And that was the 
story and in the end, and -- and th
e FPO organization to which I bel
ong to the ef -- I came  to the 
FPO much l a ter than my  boyfriend. It was very cyc
lically and they were af
raid, they were afraid 
not only for the Germans, they were afraid 
for the Jewish population because the Jewish 
population were against -- if you fight, they will kill 
all the ghetto. Otherwis
e, some will survive. 
And everybody was thinking, if somebody will be  -- will
 survive, it will be me . Not another, but 

me . They were thinking with 
the -- you know, people don™t belie
ve in death, as I told you. 
Q: Rachel, when you heard about 
the -- the -- the people from sh
tetls who were killed in the 
forest, was that one of the fi rst times that it --
 you really began to re
alize what was going on? 
A: Lots of people, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
40 
 
Q: C-Can you talk a bit about that, I mean, do 
you reme mber what you were thinking, or how it 
dawned on you?   
A: It was very terrible. When his cousin -- her c
ousin came, I had told he
r the story, and the -- all 
my friends who I meet two days ago, were shot
 on such a -- and you know, it was very terrible, 

but what can we do?  Wh at can we -- the [indeci
pherable] we -- we didn't have a place to hide, 
nobody would take us. Where should we go?  And th
ere lo -- then, all of a sudden, and the 
[indecipherable] organization, a co
uple of hundreds people, we prep
ared some  la mps  with -- with 
stuff who ca n -- who can shut out, you know, in
 case when the Germans look and we™ll throw 
whatever we have in the hands and we™ll fight. 
It was very hard to get connections with the 
people from the forest. We were 
alone. And until we get a connec
tion to take out some  people in 
the forest. It took a lot of time. 
A lot, a lot of time. And finally 
people saw that this is nonsense, 
to fight against the German where we don™t ha
ve any weapons. When we don™t have military 
people to rule us. And we™re thinking about th
e forest [indecipherable]
 but how?  And all of a 
sudden, it wa s ma ybe a month before the liquidati
on of the Wilna ghetto, yes, and we in the 
partisan organization of the ghetto, every night 
some  people were sleeping in the apartments 
whose window go out -- outside the 
ghetto, little, little pi
eces, and they have watch. If they saw 
that soldiers are surrounding the 
ghetto, they have to come  to th
eir leaders and say the parole 
Lisaroft. Lisa roft was the parole
 of [indecipherable]. I was -- 

Q: That would be the head? 

A: Yes, yes -- 

Q: Lisaroft? 

A: Lisaroft. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
41 
 
A: [indecipherable]. And they find out that tomo
rrow they are comi ng for people. And they said, 
okay, took whatever you have and go on some  places
 that wa s chosen, that we™ll fight from the 
places. And you wait until it will be the -- it will
 tell you some how, start when the ta -- when the 
Germans wi ll come, and the -- and the Lithuani an. The morni ng they came over the places and 
said you have to go, and me  [indecipherable], and 
my boyfriend Josef. [indecipherable] this will 

be your place when you start to 
take over [indecipherable] the la
mps with the -- with the stuff 
that arouse how -- how you -- can I say? 

Q: Oh, is this a Molotov cocktail? 

A: Yes, a cocktail. 

Q: Some thing that you throw? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And you throw and -- and we were staying wa
iting. I was next to Jose f. All of a sudden the 
Germans and the Lithuanian and the group of -- of
 12 or 15 people, together with one of our 
leaders, came to the yard and they said, don™t fi
ght [indecipherable] in Russia -- in Yiddish 
[indecipherable]. Don™t fight. Whatever you have, put
 -- they are taking you to Estonia for work. 
And we decided not to fight. 

Q: You decided not to fight? 

A: Not to -- we didn™t have -- they di
dn™t tell us. We can™t do it by ourself. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: We™re waited for -- 

Q: You waited for the order. 

A: -- for the order of the -- above -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
42 
 
Q: The resist ance leaders. 
A: -- of our leaders in the resistance and one
 of them ca me  and said, don™t. You are -- 

Q: Oh, one of the resistance 
leaders came and said don™t? 
A: One of the resistance -- they decide
d in the last mi nute not to fight -- 
Q: Oh. 

A: -- but the population was so 
angry that before of -- that
 several hundred of you, how ma ny 
were we, 400, the whole ghetto will be shot
. And our leader wa
s [indecipherable] up, 
Wittenberg, the -- the ma in leader of the FPO. An
d we didn™t have a choice , put it down, and -- 
Q: Can you wait to -- 

A: -- we all went to 
the mi ddle of the -- 
Q: Please stop for a second now. We™re
 just going to change tapes. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: So -- so let™s pick up with that story. You
™re describing a night wh
ere so me people in the 
resistance moveme nt we re going to ha
ve an action, you were going to rebel. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And you were all ready, and you 
were waiting for the order. 
A: Yes, and we didn™t have the order.  

Q: Let™s pick up there, you didn™t have the order. 

A: The order. And all of a sudden, my boyf
riend Josef said why, why can™t you fight? 
[indecipherable] them whatever we have. We  will 
-- we™ll die, we™ll di e, but we™ll do so mething. 
But without an order you can™t do, we  were told
 do -- do -- don™t do anything without an order. 

And the orde r come  because they decided all of a 
sudden to go out to the forest, not to fight in 
there. But it was too late. Until they fi nd the conn
ections, until they decide that the --  until the 
st ory for it  -- for i t s el f.  
Q: Do you think -- did you agree with your boyfri
end that -- with Josef, do you think you should 
have fought? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. I wouldn™t be alive, but
 you know. I don™t know, I do 
-- I really don™t know. 
From the other side, they would kill us in -- in
 a second and then what use?  What use, they 
would kill us, kill the others people, and what 
use? Their deci sion will --  was already made. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They liquidate the Jewish people in the ge 
-- in the Wilna ghetto. And we have rumors from 

Warsaw what™s doing there, and my brother-in
-law was one of the leaders of the -- of the 
resistant of Warsaw ghetto. And they heard -- be
ing in the ghetto they 
were killed. They didn™t 
know exactly how and what. After 
-- after the war I find out that 
my sister is still alive. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
44 
 
Q: At this point, where is your mother
, and do you have any 
contact with her? 
A: She was still in Rasha at the turf. 
Q: Okay. 

A: But the last month they brought there from the 
turf in the ghetto. In th
e last month she was in 
the ghetto. But I was still with Josef™s 
family, that was -- I™ll tell you soon. 
Q: And can you talk a little bit more about how you 
be -- at least became  part of the resistance 
group?  Did -- did you have any meetings, were th
ey secret meetings, how did they train you? 
A: Ye-Yeah -- yeah, I™ll tell you, I 
will tell you. I came  late to th
e resistance. [indecipherable] 
end -- we were meeting, five of us, five girls 
has one leader from the [i
ndecipherable]. And they 
were -- told us what to do, what we can do. I 
can™t do too much because I was inside of the 
ghetto. I couldn™t bring weapons. Bu
t one of our friend, he was a chemist, he was almost of the 
fifth grade of university [indeciphe
rable] and the tel -- taught how 
to ma ke the cocktail for -- 
Q: He was a chemist? 
A: -- and we™re hi -- yeah -- and we™re hiding and 
trying to do and once a week before, we also 
want to resist -- a week?  Two days before. And we
 were gathered in a bu
ilding of strashunatur. 
And in the last mi nute we heard that the Germ
ans are going to destroy 
this building. And this 
was an order fast to go out from the building. 
And one on our -- -- on our friends has a cocktail 
lamp in his hand, and he running from the [indeciphe
rable] then he fall down and he was killed 
with his own lamp in his hand. And then we we
re -- he was a boyfriend of my close friend. And 
we went to look him for the -- no, it was in th
e same  day that we were on [indecipherable] 
resistant. And we find out -- we find him in th
e morgue and -- house that he is dead, and we 
recognize his jacket, he was covered. And the
n, when everybody went out, they destroy the 
building, a big building. So
me how they find out -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
45 
 
Q: Who -- who destroyed th
e building?  The Germans?  
A: The Germans, yeah. But the people went out, he was the only one killed by himself because 
he fall down with the face on his cocktail la
mp, and he was killed, a young, nice boy. And here 
where we were up in the -- were the -- one of our 
leaders came, telling us not to fight. They said 
throw out whatever you have in the hand on the si
de, we -- that we did, and go to the mi ddle of 
the yard. We  went to the mi ddle of the yard, and they separate the wome n from the boys. And we 

want to go w-with them, and they didn™t allow it,and they took the boys and they took them to a 

place, and later on they went to Estonia, and 
with this group went Josef my friend, and I came 
back without him. And you could see that™s the 
end of the ghetto. And after that they organized 
all kinds of group, promising Gens -- Jacob Gens, 
that they are going to 
Estonia for work. What 
they did, they send the people to Estonia and they
 work. The -- Josef was in Estonia, also ma ybe 
for a year and worked. Then the -- the -- the -- th
e last  day of the war, when they saw that the 
war is lost, they shot them all and killed. On
ly a couple was hiding, ma ybe  eight, nine people, 
and they survived. And they shot them all, a
nd they didn™t have enough time  to burn them, and 
when the Soviet army came, they find the people in the -- and the one who survived sa w 

everybody. And there was her father, and becau
se when they liquidated the ghetto --  
Q: Luta™s father, and Josef. 

A: -- and yes, and Josef. And my father and 
my -- because they -- when they liqui dated the 
ghetto, yeah -- and that was three weeks before
 the liquidation from ghetto. Then nobody went 

out for work, and then some  partisans group went
 out to -- partisan. 
Maybe a couple of hundred 
people, yeah. And how did they get out?  Jacob 
Ge ns was sure that some  people, with his 

connections, with his power with the Germans, he will survive a-at least a couple of thousand 

people from the ghetto. And he could -- his wife 
was Lithuanian, his daughter was Lithuanian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
46 
 
They would hide him very, very fa
st, together with themself. But 
he believed very strongly that 
some  people with his -- and in the end, you know 
the end of him?  In the end when the people 
from the ghetto were survo -- were taken to the 
place from where they were taken to Estonia. 
You know where Estonia is that. From there, I even
 get a letter from Josef. Yes, somehow it -- he 
send out that. And Gens came there, ma ybe the -- 
to -- to see the people. And all the famous 
bosses of the ghetto, like Weiss, like Himmler, a
nd -- from the Germans, who were very close, 
good friends with Jacob, and they listened to hi
m, and -- also came. And Gens came. And then 
they want to shot th -- him. And one said I ca
n™t. We iss said ca n™t. Hi
mml e r said, I can™t shot 
him. And he said, give me the weapon, I™ll sign 
-- shot myself. Then came  a stranger who knows 
him very we ll, and shot him too, and Gens di
sappeared. But Gens, Gens was a Lithuanian 
general during the war. When the communists came
, they we re looking for him, they want to 
arrest him. I know very well a woma n who were a communist, her name  was Hannah Borofska. 
And Hannah Borofska knows very well Gens. It 
was before the ghetto, it was th-the -- the 
Russians came  over, and the -- and he came to he
r, asking her, telling her the story, that the 
Germans -- that the Russians want to arrest him, 
and can she help him, to hide him, and she did. 
And she was a communist, one of the leaders of 
the partisan organizati
ons. And some how, she 
has a connection to him, and whatever she ask 
him some thing, he did for her. And he know a 
[indecipherable]. If you wou -- wi -- he would be 
enough wise, he would help, little by little to 
go out, people in the night to the forest. Thousan
ds of people could -- could, even the time when 
they got the connection. He let th
em go out, the last couple of w
eek, the last months before so 
closed door from the ghetto. And ha -- how did 
they go out, you know, fr om -- the last group to 
the partisans, you know? A friend of mi ne, his 
name  was Kapinski, and he was -- it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
47 
 
described in some where -- he was a [i ndecipherab
le]. Before the war, he worked with the 
canalizations from all the -- so he kn
ows the road, through the canalization. 
Q: The tunnels? 
A: The tunnels. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: From the  whole city. When the whole gr
oup of 200 people, 220, went through, he was going 
through the -- you know, on the street, how so th-t
h-the round people -- the round places where 
the people are going to re
pair the canalization? 
Q: The sewer holes. 

A: The sewer hole. He went down, and after him 
the people, and he went with a pump to clean 
up the water, and people went after him until the [i ndecipherable] of the city. And when the 

people went through, he push -- he le
t the water go again. So little by little they went out. And 
then they divided in two and thre
e and they have the plan how to go to the forest, and they went 
to the forest  to fi nd a connection with the partisans. Mi -- 

Q: I want to go back to -- to Jacob Gens -- 

A: Yes? 

Q: -- because he™s -- he™s an interesting figure -- 

A: A very interesting figure -- 

Q: -- as you said, he -- he -- 

A: -- a very inte
resting figure. 
Q: What -- what did people think 
about the choice that he ma de?  Af
ter all, he was Jewish and he 
was the head of the Jewish police. So he was 
the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto. 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
48 
 
Q: When people talked about him -- 
A: What did they think -- 

Q: -- did they respect him, or did they 
-- did they -- were th
ey angry with him?  
A: They afraid of him, but -- 

Q: Afraid? 

A: -- he -- for example -- because he helped to
 organize all the cleanings from the ghetto from 
one side, but he didn™t have a choice, I think. Ot
herwise we were -- otherw
ise he was killed right 
away and they picked up anothe
r one. I™ll tell you a st
ory. My sister -- and my fa mily was in 
Rasha for turf, but they went out in September wh
en the -- it was very hot. And the winter came , 
and they didn™t have a coat, they 
didn™t have anything to
 wear. So my sister picked up -- said, I™ll 
go to my neighbors, and I will pi ck up some  cl othes. And she went, and she picked up -- they 

gave her some thing and she came back. Next time, a 
week later, they didn™t have what to eat, so 
sh -- they -- they sold some thi
ng of t he clothes she bought, and she went to buy some thing -- the 
peasants, and she went to buy a chicken or so
me thing, and other people saw her, and so the 
Gestapo -- she was arrested, she was arrested and 
bring to the prison. And 
my other sister came  
to the ghetto some how, hiding, asking what to 
do. And we we nt to the Hannah Borofska. And 
Hannah Borofska went to Gens asking hi -- her -- because she was a good friend of ours, to pick 

up my sister some , and he did and she was re --
 they let her go out, you know, for awhile. Then it 
was the liquidation of ghetto, befo
re the liquidation of get -- of the ghetto, they bought every -- 
all the people from all the [indeci
pherable] worked with the turf
, and the other places to the 
ghetto, and they liquidated. When -- and we ha -- 
and us, me  and Luta, they didn™t took with us 
through the canalization. 
And they said it is a big group and 
we can™t go so ma ny people in one 
time because we will al l [indecipherable]. You are not si milar Jews, as Jews, and they gave us -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
49 
 
Q: You are not what? 
A: Similar as jew -- you can go 
like Poles, you think al -- 
Q: Oh, oh, you don™t look like Jews. 

A: -- we are not look like Jews. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And you can take out your stars, and you have 
the direction how to go to the forest, and you 
come  by yourself. We  were five of us. 

Q: They said you were on your own. 

A: On our own. But we ge -- they gave us the di
rection how to go. And the last night, when they 
gather -- when most the older pe
ople were out from the ghetto, we 
still were looking for a place 
to go out, yes, and they s -- they told us attic 
who were connected with the na -- attic of the 
Aryan side, and in that attic wa
s a hole with a door, go out thr
ough the hole to the attic on the 
other si de, and somehow you will divi de it in 
two, and you will go to the forest by your -- 
yourself. We were looking the whole night for the attic. A whole night five of -- I was, and Luta 

and other three girls. Five or six of us. 

Q: You were in a building just tryi
ng to find this secret door inside? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in at -- the attic. And it wa
s dark and the attic was very big, and finally we 
find the -- and one of our girls was 
very brave and she said, I am r
unning the first -- first, and she 
runs through the hole, and we heard -- heard 
[indecipherable] some body was there, they catched 
up the hole, and this girl was 
catched. We  don™t know what happened to her, we never saw her 
again. And we start to run back [indecipherable]. 
And we we re trying to go out, we couldn™t. So 
we came back from all the attics to the ghetto 
street, they were empty. The Ukrainian soldiers 
were liquidated the Wilna ghetto, and we were tr
ying to find another exit 
and we couldn™t and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
50 
 
don™t know where we are. We  are alone, five gi
rls, and don™t know what to see. And then 
some how some body goe s through, and this is the last
 of the police, Aryan -- the yard of the 
Judenrat. So we went to the J
udenrat and we [indecipherable] th
ere, and with the last group we 
went to Rosa where they -- where all the people 
from the ghetto was there. It was a rainy night 
and a rainy day and they were sitting on a big pla
ce on Rosa, and in the dis, and when we c -- in 
the dirt, and as soon as we came to the -- to th
e place, right on the corner I saw my fa mily. My 
mother and my two sister s with the little child 
of three years. And my 
mother saw me , why are 
you here?  And you are here, why did you come ?  A
nd I was crying and she was crying, I said, 
where is -- and she told me  right there, the me
n were separate right aw
ay, my father and my 
brother-in-law. I said, and -- and -- and sh -- Lu
ta™s father. And I said, ﬁAnd where is Luta™s 
mother with her aunt? Why are 
you not -- not together?ﬂ And she said, ﬁLuta™s mother and the 

aunt are sitting down the hill,
 a little bit below, not far.ﬂ I sa i
d, ﬁLuta, come , we™ll go to find your 
mom, and you™ll bring here, we™ll 
be all together.ﬂ And we went to find Luta™s mo m. And we 
find them, a nd all of a sudden was an order to go out everybody, and everybody stand up, and we 

were going, but the people who were in the first pl
ace, next  to the exit, they were already throw 
out, and my mother with my sister, with the othe
r sister , with the little 
three years old child, and 
they threw them out right away to the left. 
And we were going through the [indecipherable] so 
the children were left alone w
ithout mothers, and -- and we we
re going, and Luta™a mother and 
the aunt was before, and when we came to the ex
it they pushed them right 
away to the left , the 
mother and aunt, and me and Luta [indecipherable]
 to the right. We  ca me , there were ma ybe 800 
-- 1800 dollars -- people, or 2000 people, young until 20. No children, nobody. A group on the 

right side. And the one who were 
on the left  si de were taken to
 Treblinka, Majdanek. And we 
were taken to Riga to Kaiserwa
ld. Luta will tell you the [indeci
pherable] about her mother, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
51 
 
that was the last. Another story I forgot to te
ll you, when only I came to Rosa, to the place where 
all the people from the liquidation of the ghett
o were taken, I saw a little farther a big, tall 
building. And from the roof of the building were
 three [indecipherable] like they are going to 
hang some body. Three. We said, wh
at™s this? And all of a sudden, 
three people from the partisan 
organization of Wilna, the three I was quarreling 
with them, why are not taking you with us, and 
he said we are a group people, we are full of weapons, and we can go with a group people. It was 

a friend of mi ne, Asia Bik, Janka
 Kaplan, and Abrashak Voynich, 
he was a leader of the Bund. 
And all of a sudden I saw that they went on th
e [indecipherable] and th
e [indecipherable] around 
their head and they were hanged. And the mother of
 Asia Bik was around, we start to hide in her, 
not to see. The same  day of the liquidation 
of the ghetto. And all the year s I was in the 
concentration camp, I was thinking, what happene
d to our old group. We r e  they all kotched?  
Why are these kotched, what happened to the othe
r, I didn™t know. When
 I came back to Wilna 
after the -- the liber ation, I fi nd out that these th
ree people with the weapons, get lost. Instead to 
go to the left, they went to the right, and they 
meet a group of Lithuanian and German s oldiers 
and they were looking at them, that they start to
 shot, and it was a fight
 and they were kotched 
and bought on the face of the whol
e population of the ghetto, they were hanged. This I found out 
when I returned in 1945 from the concentration 
camp. And the other people, who went the right 
way, they survived, mostly survived. A couple we
re killed during the -- be
ing in the Holocaust, 
from all kinds of people. And the 
-- the other people 
survived then.  
Q: I-I-In talking to your mother or Josef or your
 father, ha-ha-had you ever prepared for a day 

like that, I mean, had you ma de
 p-plans, or said good-bye? 
A: No, we didn™t [indecipherable]. I will tell you. Lu
ta™s father has connections and they have a 
house where the ladies who worked in their house 
for 40 years were still living. They were out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
52 
 
but the Polish wome n, they -- and the engineer ca
me  to hi m a nd asked the permission to build up 
a hiding place in their apartment. And he came to
 his son, telling him about it. As -- the -- his 
son, Josef, said, no, you have to fight the Germ
ans. In that time we were full of, you know, 
exciteme nt, we™ll find and we™ll fight, we™ll do th
is, we™ll do this, we™ll 
-- we™ll [indecipherable] 
young people, they always believe in some thing. A
nd he said, not -- I am not going. We have to 
fight the Germans. We™ll go hide, and the other peopl
e won™t. And the father said, to save my old 
life -- old life, my son don™t want. And he said 
to the person no. The worst thing was that people 
don™t -- didn™t believe in deat
h. They thought ma ybe the people 
are in -- in camps, maybe they 
are working, ma ybe we™ll surviv
e, maybe we™ll -- we™ll [indecipherable]. Because they were 
lying. They said that -- but this
 little Luta?  She was small and 
[indecipherable] they are killing 
us, they are killing us. Nobody w
ill survive, nobody will survive. 
Q: Did you believe her? 

A: I also don™t believe. After -- after especially Josef was taken, I didn't believe that  we will 
survive. The Germans [indecipherabl e] won the wa
r with the Jews [indecipherable] survive how 
many survive. In the camps also was situations 
when some how we survived that we could be 
shot. But this is later on, ma ybe 
[indecipherable] how about that?   
Q: Just a few questions about the ghetto. You 
had described that there were two. Wa s there a 
name or a number of one of the 
ghettos that you were former ly in? 
A: One was a big ghetto from once -- one side of
 Jerma street, and the other was a smaller ghetto 
from the other side of Jerma street. It was a [ind
ecipherable]. It was the Je
wish center, as I told 
you, who was empty up in the beginning before th
e ghetto started. And in their houses they put 

in the people from the whole city. And the 
other ghetto was existed 
-- existed for not long, 
ma ybe a half a year. In the other ghetto was th
e big synagogue y -- as a city, very famous, who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
53 
 
was built 600 years ago, and there was the Wilna [i
ndecipherable] was started there in the -- lot 
of years ago. And a big writer, Haim Grada describe in his books about this big synagogue, it 
was like a city. And a lot of people 
lived there who were destroyed a
nd th-their place, and they -- 
as the Germans want to o -- every other month or 
couple of week, liquidated 
a lot of people, so it 
was the easiest way, they said okay, this ghettois liquidated, why the Jews have to have two 

ghettos, it™s enough one ghetto. But what should 
we do with these people?  They put them, 
everybody in the wagons and they put them to Ponar and shot them. 

Q: Towards the end of the time in the 
ghetto, h-how is your 
health?  I mean -- 
A: My -- 

Q: -- presumably you™re not eating very well, bu
t how -- how -- what is your state of health, 
physical health? 

A: My health was good, and a lot of them helped me  that they went out from the ghetto to work 

for a farm. We worked very hard, but we were at 
the -- at the [indecipherable] all the time, and at 
the fresh air, and after that we have vegetables. 
And we have carrots, and we have beets, and we 
have this and this, and I told 
you that the -- the worker of my
 house bought us every day a little 
bit bread and milk. Mostly I bough
t it back to the ghetto, but a li
ttle piece I took. So some ti me s I 
was afraid to come  to the ghetto on the face 
of everybody who was very pale and very -- I, 
personally, looked good. But mostly the people were ve
ry, very, very pale, or very upset, and ver 
-- didn™t know what to do, get [indecipherable] get 
-- get lost, you know, a lot of people were left 
alone because a mother or a brother or a father we
nt to work and they were catched up and they 
were taken away. They thought that™s to a camp, but
 as we find out later they were shot right 
away, and kids were -- be left without the -- w
ithout parents and s -- pa
rents without kids and 
husbands without wives. I have --
 I had a friend, he was in school 
together with my sister Luba, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
54 
 
and he worked for the Judenrat. And one time 
he and an artist from [indecipherable] and 
some body else, three of them, get the permission to
 go out for awhile from
 the ghetto, outside the 
ghetto. And they bought some thing -- some  vegeta
bles, a little piece of bread, and wa -- they 
went to the ghetto back and the -- at the entr
ance was Morra, the fuehrer of the ghetto, a German. 
And he saw that they have a package with them
, and they were arrested, and people were ask 
Gens to do some thing, his wife, to took them out
 from the prison, but when he came  it was too 
las -- too late. They took them right away to P
onar and they shot -- shot them. And the wife with 
the little children were stayi
ng in the ghetto, lost and didn™t k
now what to do, and finally they 
went to Estonia with a group, and they were killed, too. 
Q: You talk about people being lo
st, or people without mothers. 
Towards the end Josef had been 
taken, you were separated from your mo
ther, what was your me ntal state? 
A: I was crying, I didn™t know what to do. And 
after awhile, you know, when you were -- were 

left alone, you don™t care about yourself, rea
lly. What will ha ppen will ha ppen, you™re alone. 
Otherwise you are [indecipherable] from this pe
rson, from that person, you get along. What will 
happen, will happen. And when I was left with Luta
, I was yo -- always cared about Luta and she 
about me . And we were afraid that some thing ca
n happen, so we tried our best to go through, and 
we didn™t have a choice. You know, people, when th
ey are healthy, they can kill themself. It wa s 
not too ma ny suicide in that time. I was wonderi
ng -- it was a little bit, but not much, not ma ny. 
Other people will -- said, my G
od [indecipherable] why are we 
living, what for?  I™ll commit 
suicide. But not too ma ny commit suicide, not in
 the camps, or -- I know a couple of -- I think 
that Luta™s mother commit suicide in the -- on he
r way in the -- in the train where they were 
taking from the left to Treblinka. 

Q: S-So -- so what are you suggesting, that ma ybe people were too much -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
55 
 
A: I don™t know how -- 
Q: -- in shock to even do anything about it? 

A: I don™t know how to explain it,
 I really don™t. Maybe the will 
to live is very strong. I don™t 
know, but people were left for thems e lf. Ever
y person was for themself in that time. 
Q: Will you tell a stor y about what Luta™s tut 
-- again it™s towards the end and it™s becomi ng 
clear that you and Luta will be together, and 
Luta™s father gave you some  advice about being 
together. Can you tell that story? 

A: She -- she -- no, no, she -- where we in the ghe
tto have to go out to the forest, we were 
dressed like normal people, made up our hair nice
, and have nice pocketbook and were prepared 
to go out like Polacks, and maybe we will -- can
 reach the forest. And before we came to say 

good-bye to her father and mother. And the father 
looked at her and he said -- Luta was in that 
time 15. And he said, ﬁLuta, you are a child, you are 
left alone.ﬂ I said, ﬁShe™s not alone, she™s 
with me .ﬂ And he said, ﬁYou are also a child.ﬂ Iwas 20 in that time  -- 19 and a half [inaudible]. 
And he said, you are also a child. But Luthishka
, don™t run without Rochola. Without me . And 
stayed all the time on all our life together, then 
she get ma rried, I get ma rried, and we still were 
friends and our husbands were friends. And the 
whole life was -- I was very upset when I left 
Wilna and she was staying. But I hoped that she™ll 
come. I write her all the time to come, and her 

daughter was here. I was sure that -- 
but it took a lot of time until she came.  
Q: Let™s take you back to right th
at night, or perhaps it™s the morn
ing after of the liquidation, and 
again you are with Luta.  

A: Yeah. We were sta -- 

Q: And you™re tryi ng to reach -- 

A: The forest. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
56 
 
Q: -- her mother -- well, you pick up, you pick up. 
A: You know, when we were taken to the place wh
ere all Jews wel -- were already for the night 
from the ghetto, we were five of us, five. Before 
we were six and one girl
 we were with -- when 
she were caught.  

Q: Through the attic. 

A: And we were going and together with us wa
s another girl from our friends. Her name  was 
Raia -- Rasha. And we went through the place she used to live before the -- before the ghetto. 

And all of a sudden she said, ﬁGirls, I am running.ﬂ
 And she disappeared from the party. She saw 

that next  to her were -- the Germans were not
 around or some thing, she saw her place where she 

lived, and she jumped into the yard where she liv
ed. She thought that all of us will go after her, 

but we couldn™t. The Germans was right here. I me
t her after the war, a
nd she still good friends 
with Luta, she went out and she came to the yard
 she was living, and she came into a apartment. 
And the -- pull open the door, and she closed befo
re her eyes [indecipherable] go away. And she 
went out to the attic, and ther
e was a little window in the at
tic, and she looked through the 
window until the whole group will go by. The group was still going to the place they ga thered all 

the people, and she looked -- 

Q: Marching by? 

A: -- yeah, like the people ma rching by. A
nd it went dark, and nobody was around. She went 
again to the neighbor, and she looke
d out, she didn™t let her go in, 
but she gave her a little thing 
to cover her head, and she gave her some  food. 
And she explained to her the way how she can go 
to the forest . And she went to the forest and she 
reached the forest, and she reached the partisans, 
and she was -- her sist er was already in the part
isans and she was older, until the end of the war 
with the partisan. And we meet her when Luta, on 
her way to the United States, in Italy she came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
57 
 
specially to see her, and then she was in New Yo
rk, and I saw her and she told me that she -- the 
story with the Polack that one of
 them give her to -- what to eat then show her the way to go to 
the partisans. So she has the -- 
the way, like they gave us ever
ybody, the directions how to go to 
the partisans, everyone from us has it. And she went to the partisans there,
 she reached them and 
she survived the war in the partisans. And we 
went to the concentrati
on camp [indecipherable] 
Q: You -- you me ntioned in that case a -- a Polish person who helped some what, but -- but 
generally did -- could you rely 
on Polish people to help you? 
A: On some , but very little, very 
little. Some  were afraid. Some were -- but I were -- like  I told 

you that my sister went to a fa mily and she 
want to pick up some th
ing to eat, and a son 
[indecipherable] went out thr
ough the other door and bring the 
Gestapo and she was arrested. 
And it was all around, all around. And some  people th
roughout th-the -- the -- the kids, and some  
Polish people pick them up and they -- and th
ey™ll grow them like Poles, like Lithuanian. 
Q: H-How did you know though, who to trust? 
A: It was very hard. It was very hard. So
me -- someti mes [indecipherable] and sometime 
[indecipherable]. I know a fa mily, no -- were -- we
™re connected with them through the ma rriage, 
and they lived in Lithuanian, and his wife was ve
ry energe t -- his mother was very energetic and 
she saved a lot of kids, giving them to the Lith
uanian fa mily. And one of them was her little 
daughter, she was about two or th
ree years. And the li
ttle daughter, the Lit
huanian family who 
she knows, took her as a daughter, an
d the family survived the war. Survived the war, and when 
the war finished they went to look the Lithuanian
 people, where their daughter were. Their sister, 
the daughter left, and they couldn™t find it. As soon
 as the -- they didn™t have any children, as 
soon as the German lost the war, they moved 
and took the girl, and they look for her ma ybe 20 
years, and they still not [indeci
pherable] I was connect
ed through a ma rriage with them, with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
58 
 
brother of the girl. They were looking for her 
for 20 years, and she was lost. A -- there is a 
[indecipherable] I don™t know if you leed -- he wa s 
left in the Lithuanian fa mily when he was 
two. And he grew up as a Lithuanian person. A
nd when he was 19, in the fa mily was an old 
woman, an old grandmother, and 
she was dying, and she was on her he
art that she ha
s to tell the 
boy who he is, his roots. And she told him that he 
is Jewish, and that his pa
rents left him when he 
was two years old, and the parents perished fr
om the Holocaust, and that™s it, but he was 
Lithuanian through and through. She was a engin
eer and he wa s a writer, and he was very 
touched with the story he heard. And after he he
ard the story, he wrote 
a book. In Yiddish is the 
[indecipherable]. The Internal Check
. You know the checks, the play? 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: The internal checks, it means the -- forever, forever, yeah, the checks. And what was in that 

story, that a Jewish guy is playi
ng checks with a German. And he ha
ve to -- he have to or -- he 
have to lose, and if he will win, he can be shot. He didn™t want to lose to gi ve hi -- the 
satisfaction the German to win, a
nd he can™t win because he could 
be shot. This is the story of 
the book. And as soon as he feel that he is 
going to win, he took some thing back and he 
[indecipherable] in losing. And dur
ing his playing with the Ge rman,all kind of histories from the 
ghetto, from the camps were his mi nd, and he describe
 it in his -- after he 
find out -- he was also 
a sensitive boy -- he start to look for his r
oots. He didn™t find anybody from the fa mily, but 
finally he ma rried a -- a Jewish gi
rl and he left for Israel. I thi
nk that he left Israel too, he™s 
some where in the -- in German or -- Canada [i
ndecipherable]. His name  was Marris. All kind of 

stories happened. And I™ll tell you, th
ousands of thousands of Jewish children survived and they 
are in [indecipherable] family, they don™t know
 that they are Jewish. They grew up as 
Lithuanian, as Poles, th-the whol
e family perish, and they get -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
59 
 
Q: Let -- let™s pick up the story 
of -- of -- of where we ended 
it a bit ago, you 
were actually 
telling about the liquidation of 
the ghetto. And at this point a 
group -- the whole 
-- all the people 
from the ghetto are gathered in a field? 
A: In a field, in -- 

Q: An-And you called it Rosha? 

A: It™s -- it was -- Rosha is the place. It was a 
ceme tery, an old cemetery. I reme mb er it was very 
rainy, and people were sitting in th
e -- in that -- in -- in the wate
r, in the dirts, upset, and you 
know, not believing in survival. And then everything 
was so fast and with such a -- with such a 
noise, with such a rush, and sch-schnell, schnella,
 schnella, schnella. People
 couldn™t think. Like 
animals. They were -- they were pushed to
 the wagons, th-they were the place to stay. 
Q: And whe r e was Luta at this point? 

A: With me.  

Q: We re you holding hands? 
A: We  were together. 
Q: You were together. 

A: Yeah. Next to each other. 

Q: When the move me nt started, did y
ou try to get back to your mother? 
A: I couldn™t find her, I know where she was, and 
she was already gone, and sent to the left. She 
and my two sisters and the little 
child, with the nice blonde hair. 
Q: Did you know what that meant at that
 point, to be sent to the left? 
A: We i magine that they are going to 
the -- they™ll be s
hot. Very fa -- 
Q: You did imagine that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
60 
 
A: Yes. And they were right away
 sent to Majdanek, I 
think, and there they were sent to the gas 
chambers. And I want to tell you, if we -- me  and 
Luta wouldn™t go to look for her mot her, what 
it took, five, 10 mi nutes, we would stay with my 
parents and we will -- would send also to the 
left. But were -- in the begin -- 
in the beginning, all the people were
 sent to the left, especially 
when there was a little child. I reme mber one
 person, she has two lit
tle children, she was young, 
had her little children and she 
has a package on her shoulder with some  blankets, or some  
clothes. And she heard right away that with lit
tle children, people were sent away. So she empty 
up her bag, and she left only a litt
le blanket, and both of her child
ren, three years and two years, 
she put into the -- to th
e bag, put up her shoulders like it™s cl
othes, and she went through to the 
left. The orientati -- other people were -- th-the  
will to life was so str
ong that other people left 
their children. There was some body -- one person left
 a kid by herself, she -- she want to live. 
And she knew that she™ll take the 
child she™ll be killed together w
ith her. And I can™t say that she 
did wrong. I was thinking if my 
sister would leave the child, ma
ybe she would be alive. But you 
know, it™s -- it™s a terrible situation. You can™t say that she didwrong, that she™s a bad person the 

way she did that, because in that mo me nt, she 
get like crazy. It was a 
very terrible thing. 
Q: What did it sound like?  Do you reme mber sounds? 

A: People like -- like that people, 
that -- that they didn't know what
 to do it -- first of all, the 
noise and the Germans with the schnella, schne
lla, schnella, schnella, schnella, you couldn't 
orient what™s doing, what™s going on. You couldn™
t think. And there all of a sudden you see you 
-- you are staying with a group of young, beautiful 
girls, healthy. When you are 18, when you are 
19, when you are 17, as much as you go through, you 
are still young. And we saw that ma ybe we 
are going temporary to a camp to work, and we were
 sure that one of -- on the left  side will be 

shot, because they were sick, they were old, they 
were little children. We  were cryi ng, we were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
61 
 
don™t have the right to cry. The Germans woul
d go through and see some body crying, go to the 
left.  
Q: A-And so, when you went to the right, wh
ere did you go?  On-onto 
a train, or trucks? 
A: Yeah, we went -- the separa
tion wa s ready, they put us to 
truck, very crowded trucks, and 
they -- they -- we didn™t know where we are goin
g. [indecipherable] was very crowded. We  were 
going for two days, not eating and not drinking and 
we didn™t have a bathroom, we didn™t have -- 
the conditions were terrible. And 
all of a sudden, we came when the 
-- the mi ddle of the night to 
a place, it was such a beautiful forest , and they opened the doors, and the illumi nation was so 

strong, so ma ny lamps, so ra -- and full of soldiers
 and who will -- and they 
start to throw out us 

from the wagons who were [indecipherable] peopl
e. Maybe hundreds was in one wagon that we -
- all of us were about 2000 girls 
fr om Wilna. And they said, fi rst 
of all, everything you have in 
the hand, on the side. We have in our bags, we pu
t in some money, some -- I reme mber my sister 
make a double -- a double -- ther
e can put some  money, some 
jewelry, so put it everything 
[indecipherable] and we were s -- like we are. A
nd they put that to the -- to some  barracks on 
[indecipherable] I don™t know, well,
 hundreds -- hundreds of people already were there. And all 
of a sudden we heard that after we we re ther
e a couple weeks, a couple of days, I -- I don™t 
[indecipherable] all of a sudden we have to -- we
 have to go through a bus, to have disinfection, 
we are all dirty. And we heard that they are shav
ing us the hair, they are taking out our clothes, 
they give us other cl othes and they left  us 
[i ndecipherable]. And we were waiting when we will 

have to go to the bus, we didn™t know that some  bus
es were gassed in that 
time  not, and it was in 
case of [indecipherable]. And Luta, my friend has 
hair until here, blonde, bi g, how they call of it 
-- 

Q: Curls?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
62 
 
A: Not curls, but you know they are together. 
Q: Braids?  

A: Braids, yeah. 

Q: Braids. 

A: And they really were so upset that the Germ
ans will have the satisfaction to cut it, so I fi nd 
some where a scissor and I cut her hair until here, 
for myself. I didn™t want 
to give the satisfaction 
the Germans to do it. And then we heard that th
e only thing what wed -- wh
at is left  is that 
people -- is their soap. And we had a little soap. 
And my friend Mira, who was with us in the five 
who has to go out -- the four of us, because one 
run away, has a little piece of gold. Her mother 
gave her, she had. And I said, ﬁMira, give me  the lit
tle gold, I™ ll melt it a litt
le bit of soap. I™ll put 
it in.ﬂ And we wash it, and you 
will -- let™s see that
 you have some thing, ma ybe we™ll need it. 
The five of us ma ybe wi ll buy a little bit of bread 
for it. She said okay, it™s
 -- it™s -- it™s a deal. 
And I gave it, and I gave it and I said, hold it. Sh
e was in class together with me . And then they 
put us to the baths [indecipherable]. First of all 
were full of soldiers, young German sol diers, and 
they shave whatever hair they saw in the wome n. 
They shaved us all the 
-- without hair. And all 
the what is in the body, they did it. They shaved 
Luta, and they gave us other clothes who were 
big, they gave a small dress who are small, they
 gave a long dress, without underwear, it was -- 

we went out from the bath, we didn™t recognize 
each other how we look. And all of a sudden I 
asked the girl, Mira, where is your soap?  She said
, ﬁOh I forgot on the table.ﬂ [indecipherable]. 
And then they put us to the camp behi
nd Riga, was a schlasenhof, the place where 
[indecipherable]. We  looked -- I 
can™t describe it, how we l
ooked. Some  were laughing, some  
were crying, some  were s -- you know, you didn™t 
know what to do. Well, we came to the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
63 
 
first night, and we changed between
 other -- each other the clothes.
 Who has the big clothes, give 
to a bigger si -- person has a small, ha -- some how
 we make ourself to be
 similar of people.  
Q: Okay. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Where we were was that you we
re describing that after you had 
been given these clothes, they 
didn™t fit, you switched around again. 
A: That™s [indecipherable] 

Q: And you were getting ready -- you we
re describing sort of the state -- 
A: Yeah, so -- 

Q: -- of the girls at th
is point, the young wome n. 
A: -- to look like -- look like peop
le, not like [indecipherable] we 
couldn™t survive otherwise. We  
were very cooperating with -- with
 each other and helping each ot
her, whoever we were, if we 
knew each ot her or not. 

Q: Did anybody become  a kind of a leader, an informal leader? 

A: They choose some body. We  have on every table 
in the -- in the camp, 23 people, who in the 
morning they gave us a piece of bread with a littl
e bit tea be fore we went to work. And then we 
went to work, we worked the whole day, and in
 the evening we came, some ti me s aft e r work, 
every time  we were counting, before we went to
 work, and after we came, we were counting we 
-- the same amount people came back. And then 
when we came back we were staying in line 

because there was a kitchen and we have little 
-- little bowls to pick up the soup, and we were 
going with the soup upstairs and there were on th
e table, on every table we re 23 peoples, and 
there were an older people on every table from 
one of us, who divided 
the pieces of bread. And 
the pieces of bread you have to have for the 
whole day. And Luta was always very hungry, and 
she said, give me , I™ll eat the bread right away. And I didn™t give her. She was angry at me  

because she was young, she want to eat. And I ga ve 
her half a piece, I sai
d, the half a piece will 
be for lunch. Otherwise we will not survive. 
And she listened to me. And sometimes we came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
65 
 
from where -- yes, when we came to the concentr
ation camp i n Riga, in Strassenhof, they divide 
the people, some  people were going 
every morning to a factor y -- it was out in I -- I have -- can I 
make a little break?  I [indecipherable] I reme mbe r  everyt hing, someti mes I mi x it up, but I make

the -- yeah, we were sent to a textile factory, 
Yugalas ma nufactury to work. And we worked 
about 12 hours a day in the morning. And after 
12 hours we returned. We returned and when we 
came back they count us again and sometimes 
we were punished. You were not going so well, some  were out of the lines, and for that you have 

to ma rch for an hour and an hour a half on the yard where the -- where the camp was for 

punishme nt. Next time your -- you didn't sing so we
ll, because we have to go singing, we were 

on the mi ddle of the road, and we have to sing --  

Q: Singing? 

A: -- sing the German songs that
 they™ve taught us. Va -- show 
that we are strong. And if we 
didn't sing so nice, we were punished, we have to
 walk for another hour and a half before we™ll 
have our dinner. And then we came back. So we
 worked in the Yugalas manufactury for all the 

time. Some people were sent to another 
factory where -- where they did silk. 
Q: What were you ma king, Rachel? 

A: We  were ma king the linen, like the thick linen. 

Q: Linen?  

A: Linen. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes. And in the morning we go over there, in
 the evening we came ba ck. One story I must to 
sell -- to s -- tell you. As there 
were all from Wi l na, mostly the people knew each othe r. And 
once, girl who were starting in school with me , 
came to another girl, a friend of me , and said to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
66 
 
her, Leia -- Leia was her na-name, do you want to 
go to the earlier -- because the people from the 
silk factory used to go a half an hour early home,
 and our group went a half an hour later. Do you 
want to change with me , I™ll go with your gr
oup, and you go with my group, because th-they che 
-- only they need the account. So she said, why not
, I am tired, I want to come  to a little bit 
earlier to have a rest, and sh
e went. When our group went back, she didn't show up, Lola, the 
person who ask her to go home . 
Q: Leia?  

A: Leia was the one who she ask to go instead of her -- 

Q: Oh, okay, all right. 

A: -- with the first group. And 
she™s supposed to go with the s
econd group, and she didn't show 
up. So our group came and when they count, was one person less. Which means that one 

disappeared. And they s -- tried to find out how 
could it be. They were count, the first group 

came, everybody came who disappeared from the ot
her group. It was not 
too hard to find out, 
then they find out that one person from this group came befor e  with the other group. Anyway, 

they find out that the girl Leia came instead of Lo
la. And Lola has a mother
 also there. And they 
said, why did you come  instead of her?  They find 
out that this Lola is disappeared. Anyway, they 
took her out and together
 with the mother of Lola, and they took her out some where we don™t 
know, we never saw her again. I heard that they put 
her to the -- to prove the main roads, because 
some ti me s the m -- the roads around Riga, there we
re ma in -- mi nes around, so they took people 
to go on the roads until they fall on a mi ne and 
they were killed on the mi ne. You understand, 
yeah? 

Q: They used her as a [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
67 
 
A: They [indecipherable]. And her mother was 
killed right away because
 after awhile they 
bought the clothes back to the -- what happened, this girl Lola decide with
 another two me n, they 
find some how a hiding pl ace, and they want to hi
de there. And not to find it out right away 
because they have to go out, they have to
 -- somehow they arranged with some body, I don™t 
know hi -- how, the girl survived. She asked the gi
rl to go inst ead of her so the Germans will not 
find out that some body was mi x -- mi ssed. So the girl
 was killed instead of her. She hide then, 
and she was hidden for a long time, maybe a coupl
e of months, a half a year, until their food 
finished and they were very hungry and one of 
the guys went out some how to find some thing to 
eat, and he was kotched, and th -- caught, and th
e whole group, the three 
of them were caught. 
But they didn™t kill them, they send them to Stu
tthof and they ma de [ind
ecipherable] Stutthof and 
this -- this girl survived the war. I met her, 
her name  was Lola Gittelson. 
Maybe she is still alive 
in Leningrad until now. But the other girl  who came  
-- so even to run away, even to hide then, it 
was very hard. Even if they find out the connection.  
Q: A-As you™re describing it, there 
-- there are not a lot of choices. 
A: No. She™s -- she™s -- 
Q: And yet, you™re ma king daily choices
 that in some  way keep you alive. 
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: We ll ha -- what were the things that you fe
lt that you were doing that 
were keeping you alive? 
A: Even when she would come  to me, ask me  -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- I don™t know if I would l
eave Luta. But -- but if you would be alone, she would ask me , 
will I -- will you go before me , 
I will go with your group and you go with my group, I would go. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
68 
 
I wouldn™t think about that some thi
ng is wrong. I -- she didn't  tell me
 that she want to hide, that 
she disappear. And I wouldn™t think about. So the 
girl didn™t think about 
it too. But she did it.  
Q: Well I guess one thing I was -- I™m -- I was al
so asking is that how -- how were the small 
ways -- what were the smaller things that you did 
on a day to day basis in the camp that kept you 
going?  
A: First of all, I try to
 keep myself clean. In the bathroom -- 
in the -- to make a shower. We  never 
had hot water, it was hard to wash yourself. As ba
d as it was, I would every day to take a shower. 
A shower to wash myself, to [inaudible] my body. 
Secondly, I was together with Luta, it help -- 
we were together, we were -- then I thought a lo
t of my boyfriend. I thought he was taking to a 
camp, I a m t a king on a camp, maybe he™ll survive, ma
ybe I™ll meet him, s o it hold me  to survive, 
to -- to -- to -- to -- to eat
. Even that -- that the soup is terrible
 without taste, I ate it, even I could. 
And again, I was with Luta. I was caring with her, 
she was a little gi rl , still she was a small child. 
Her [indecipherable] she was a strong -- a strong 
[indecipherable] we were together. So me times 
she was taking care of me, some ti me s I was taking care of her. 

Q: How did she take care of you? 

A: I [indecipherable] we were together. And I were
 with the ot her two girl
s with whom we were 
-- we wanted to run away. And we were young.We were still young, and we can survive the 

portion they give us to eat. A
nd some how we survived on our way. 
Q: Did you sleep in the same  -- di
d you sleep next to each other? 
A: Four ap -- yeah, four across. Four people ac
ross. Friends. There, when we came  to our room, 
we were alone. The Germans were some  very 
-- we were go -- go out from our yi -- you know, 
went to work or what, and were -- we  were 
still working. We didn't have anything from them, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
69 
 
but we were going to work, we had a little bit fr
esh air on our way, by foot. And then we worked. 
For ourself, but not -- not -- 
the mi nd was a little bit busy. 
Q: W- Wa s there a danger with so ma ny girls a
nd then German guards that -- that some girls 
mi ght be raped? 
A: No, but there were some  that they were girlfr
iends of the -- of thepeople who looked after 
them somehow, I don™t know, I don™t know. 

Q: So some of the girls from Wilna mi ght -- 

A: Very little were -- 

Q: -- become  friendly with a guard or -- 

A: Yeah, there were some , very little. Two, three.
 [inaudible]  
Q: How did the other girls view that? 

A: What can they do?  They 
said it dangerous, but you know, it 
happened, it happened. This was 
all about Strassenhof and some  girls came pregnant
 from the ghetto in the beginning, they had 
the husbands. The husbands were taken off, and on
e wa -- friend of mi ne came there, she was in 
the six months pregnant. They were three of them from the girls who came  to Riga. And then 

they took them to Kaiserwald back, and promised to bring them back. And they ma ke them 

abortions and they came back. Wa s how they -- they destroyed the pregnancy. 

Q: The -- the -- the woman who had a six month old baby? 

A: Yes, they made the -- it™s not 
an abortion, it™s a like 
taking birth, and then they came back to 
the Strassenhof and they were working. They surv
ive the war, too. A lot of the people who were 
sent to Riga, to Strassenhof, on the left, a lot 
of them -- I™ll tell you another story. When we came  
to Kaiserwald, before we went to Stutthof, th
ey make -- the Germans ma
ke lists of the people 
they who they sent to Strassenhof. They wrote 
the name  and the last name , where they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
70 
 
born, their age and -- I was staying with Luta, 
she was 15 years old and I was 19. And some how 
when the [indecipherable] when they ma de the list,
 I was thinki ng that  there were an action in the 
ghetto where they took the children until 16 years, 
and they took them a way for a camp, but they 
so -- shot them. And Luta was 15. I said, Luta, 
we ™re describing us the same  age. What will 
happen to you will happen to me . We™ll ma ke us both 18. I am 18 and you are 18, and we are 
sisters-in-law. She said why do you want what -- 
ma kes o-old?  I said, Lu
ta, this is the way I 
want, and we™re ma king. And she was 18 and I was 
18. After a ye -- not a y
ear, after maybe eight 
months, all of a sudden they took 
the whole party from the rooms to
 the yard and they start to 
count us. And they count us, I don™t reme mber how
 ma ny people. And all of a sudden they called 
up people before 18 and after 20 -- after 22. If So
lanis -- Luta was written her real name , that 
she™s fo -- 15, in that time she was 16, she wa
s taken out for death. They took them out, and 
people were very upset. From the room they knoc
ked in the windows, that I am not 20, and I -- 
you know that -- and they were took aga -- some wh
ere, and next day all their clothes were 
brought back to the -- they were 
all shot. If Luta would describe
 her real age, she would have 
been shot. Nothing helped. You couldn™t ask becaus
e different people, different soldiers came  to 
pick up this action. And about, I 
would say two or 300 people were 
taken away and shot. After a 
couple of months they took us to Germany, to Stutthof. 
Q: How long were you in the camp in Riga? 

A: In Strassenhof I think we were two weeks a
bout, if I reme mber. In Riga we ma ybe in 11 
months. I have wrote here how l
ong we were in Riga. Strassenhof 
from October ™43, prin -- til 
August ™44. In August ™44 all of a 
sudden, they came  and they said -- because the Russian army 
came next with -- they took us from Riga to St
utthof, to Germany, when in Wilna already were 

the Russians, were liberated. The -- Wilna wa
s al -- already liberated, and I reme mbe r  the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
71 
 
German bos s came to us, to our big group and sa
id girls, you are my Jews . In case when the 
Russians come , I put on your clothes and I am a Je
w. [indecipherable] he was caught in the end 
and he was shot from the s e people. 
Q: Were there ever any Germans that you came acro
ss whether in the ghetto or in the camps that 
-- that -- some body who helped you perhaps?   

A: Not me , not me , but there were. Very little 
there were. I had, when I -- as soon as the 
Germans came -- as soon as the Germans ca me, it was in ™41, I worked at the German place 

where the soldiers were. And I was working 
in the yard, you know, the cazarnes where the 
soldiers were during the day and dur
ing the night, and they need he
lp to clean the yard, to clea n 
the walls, and they took girls from -- before it wa
s the actions of the pink 
scheins, he know -- he 
knew about that, that some thing wrong can happ
en. And he was so bad th -- a young guy in the 
brown clothes with the swastika, and he didn™t even
 allowed us to talk to each other, we were 
five girls. And all of a sudden he came  to 
me  and he said, ﬁLook, do you have a pink schein?  
Because something will go on in the ghetto.ﬂ I said
 yes. And I was -- I was afraid, why is he 
asking?  He™s such a bad person. And I came and I told
 the other girls what he
 told to me , what -- 
what he told me , and they said, oh, we don™t have 
anything. We are afraid to go to ghetto. What -
- ask him, maybe they -- he can do some thing fo
r us. We  have neighbors on -- in Zarinyitz, on 
such and such street. I said I am afraid. Hesaid, go, ask, we don™t ha
ve a choice because we 
don™t have a place to hide , we don™t 
have a ra -- a pink schein. And 
I came to hi m a nd I told him. 
You know what he said?  I am okay, but my friends
, two girls, they lived some where there behind 
the bridge, and they don™t have anything. And he 
said, ﬁTell them as soon as they can,ﬂ in 
German he s a id, ﬁlet them go to th
e street, let them take off their --
 their signs -- their stars, and 
let them go over the bridge, I will catch them.ﬂ
 Somehow we went with
 the -- with the group, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
72 
 
and they find the [indecipherable] that they took 
out the stuff, and they went to the paveme nt, 
and they went through the bridge
 -- [indecipherable] blonde girl. 
And they were going, all of a 
sudden this guy went through the bridge and took 
the boys -- girls under the hand, and they said, 
go wherever you [indecipherable] and I™ll go with 
you. And they came to the street, and he said 
go and ask if the people will take you, and I will 
wait for 15 - 20 mi nutes. If they want to take 
you, you™ll st ay. Otherwise you will return and 
I will took you to the ghetto. And can you 
imagine that the -- that the neighbors let he r st ay, and he was waiting, waiting. We  never saw 
him again, she never saw it again. What it was, I can
™t explain. He was so bad to us if we were 
talking to each other. Maybe he was 19 years ol
d. She was with the -- with the stick, he  was 

hurting us, we were afraid for him. In that mo me
nt he saved the girl. Sh
e perished another time 
because there were lot, lot of time, but it happened, a Germa n boy.  

Q: During those 11 mont hs that you were ther
e and you were working, just what was your 
general state, what was your frame of mi nd? 
A: We  hoped that some day we™ll be liberated. We
 knew the war is going to be -- to the end. 
Some how you know -- we were working with Lit
huanian people, Lithuanian were guarding us. 
Not Lithuanian, but Latvian people. It was Riga. 

Q: And they were telling you things? 

A: Sometime. Very little. That the war is goi
ng --  th-t hat the Germans will lose the war.  
Q: At this point did you know anything 
about your mother or your father? 
A: I hoped that ma ybe, ma ybe, but I had little -- 
little hope for the people
 who were s -- were 
sent to the left, because it was a lot of children, a 
lot of old people, a lot of sick people. Mothers 
went because  of their children, they di dn™t want  
to leave them alone. But still a little hope was 
maybe. And they return after th
e war to Lithuani a, to Wilna because I hoped that some body of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
73 
 
the family will st ay alive, and we said to each other, wherever the war will fini sh, wherever you 
be, you return to Wilna, and it™s here we™ll meet
. This way, we returned to Wilna and then we 
didn™t ha ve a place to go back and you know, st
art to build up their 
own life how it was.  
Q: Did you pray at all when you were in the camp? 

A: No, I wasn™t religious.  

Q: We re you -- wa -- anything that brought you solace? 

A: I thought if God woul d exist, it wouldn™t 
happen. And if it happe
ned [indecipherable] 
righteous, it means that there is not God 
in the world. Maybe I was wrong, but you know.  

Q: Can you tell us about th-the switch, a -- I gu
ess it -- you were saying it was August of ™44, and 
-- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- what wa s going on, and you were moved to a new -- a new camp. 

A: August ™44, we were working, we came for wor -- from work, and they saw it, they came to 
our room and said, be ready, tomorrow we ar
e going by boat to another camp. We didn™t know 
where, we didn™t know what. And we were ready, 
and we went to Gdansk, Gdansk and they put 
it to a big boat on the bottom. Ve ry crowded. They put up all the [indecipherable]. And we were 
going with the ocean -- with the Baltic Ocean. A
nd we were hungry, we didn™t ha ve what to eat, 
it™s so crowded. And I never saw an ocean. And I 
saw Luta, some how let us go to the top to see 
the ocean. I want to see an ocean. I don™t reme mb
er how, but we went to the top and we saw the 
ocean. And we came ba ck to our place, and we came  to Stutthof. 

Q: What was the ocean like? 

A: Baltic Ocean. 

Q: But can you describe seeing it for the fi rst time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
74 
 
A: You know it™s big. [indecipherabl e] of water,
 we saw only water, water without a beach, 
without a land, from all the [indecipherable] 
you know?  Interesting [indecipherable] came back, 
and it was so crowded, it was so dirty, it was so 
[indecipherable] and dark, and people were -- we 
didn™t know where we are going, to wh
at and to when. And then they
 brought us to the Stutthof, 
that terrible camp. And we saw 
the people like death were goi
ng around here and there, and -- 
and again sounds that -- and the -- and they was s
houting, and ri -- people we
re -- they lost their 
mi nd, they -- they -- how can you survive it, fr
-from the noise, from the -- I reme mb er they 
bought her to her room, and a crying woma n was  th
e [indecipherable] it means the oldest of the -
- of the rooms we were, it™s a bi
g room, and they make there the 
per -- a peu. It means -- it means 
they want the count. 
Q: A roll call. A roll -- 
oh count, the roll call. 
A: Yeah. And we were staying to five -- five people
 here, next to them another five, next to them 
another five, next to them another 
five until the end of the big hall.
 And all of a sudden they said, 
sit down where you stand. And one were 
sitting in the feet of the othe
r. One with another, five of 
us. And there were a little empty room, and a
nother group five [indeciph
erable] they said, sit 
down. And here how they live. And they gave us a 
little bowl, and said this is for your food. This 

is if you want urinate. This is what -- this
 what you have. You couldn™t wash it, you couldn™t 
change it. 

Q: You couldn™t wash it? 

A: Or you couldn™t change it, ther e was nothing. That™s 
all they did. And we were oy -- and Luta 

start to say here we™ll die, we™ll di e fro m the -- the -- the --  Rochola, Rochola, she said, will we 

die, will we survive?  I said, ye
s, we™ll survive fr om the war. 
Q: Did you believe that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
75 
 
A: I told her to give her a li
ttle bit hope. I didn™t be
lieve it. [inaudible] hope. And then, after 
awhile and we didn™t work, that was the worst. Bu
t still there was a washroom with cold water, 
and seldom were of all the people we re going to
 the washroom to wash themself. They didn™t 
have energy. They didn™t have the -- they were 
not strong any more. And 
we went out only from 
the room for  awhile. It was soon winter, we saw big mountains of dead, dead naked bodies 
around the corner of the [inaudible]. 
We returned. I tried to take a 
shower every day, as bad as it 
was, as cold the water as was.  

Q: Did Luta -- 

A: And I took Luta also as -- and she was afraid 
that it™s the end. And we
 lived there maybe for a 
month or six weeks. It wa s very terrible, very
 dirty. And all of a sudde
n we heard that people 
were taken to work on farms, 
somehow. Some pe ople were afra
id, but we saw one group went. 
They picked up some  pe ople. And we said to each 
other, Luta to me  and I to her, let™s go, let™s 
try. And some how we went out to
 the group, and we were picked up to go to work to there, 
because the German people, the men, they were all 
taken to the army, to the front, to -- t-t-to 
fight. And all the wome n were left with the big 
farms, and the winter was comi ng, and they have 
to pick up the -- th-the 
beets and the carrots and the potatoe s, and the -- 
Q: The harvest. 

A: -- they didn™t have. So [indecipherable] peopl
e get some people from the camp. And they got 
as five of us, and we went. This ma y be also ch
anged a little bit our life 
and helped to survive. 
We worked very, very ha rd. We  came to a place,
 and the wome n were -- was very, very bad. But 
there was a housekeeping woma n, a nd she cooked fo
r us once a day. In the morning we wake up, 
we went to the field to -- 
that™s right, the field, yeah? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
76 
 
A: To work. It was very hard to pick up from th
e earth th-th-th-the -- the carrots and the beets, 
and the -- and the beets for the -- for the calf
s, you know, the white one. 
And -- with the hand, we 
didn't have it -- and she, th-th-th
-th-th-the -- the wife of the N
azi was after us, urrr. And they 
brought Ukrainian people also, the one who were ca
ught from -- I don™t know, from the army or 
from what. And they were shouting of the -- 
with the worst things on the woma n --- on the 
woma n, the boss. And she came to us, can you tell me
 what they said?  And they said terrible 
words, I said, we don™t know Ukrainian, how ca
n we know what they said, we don™t know. And 
they were angry, you know, they were not so afraid
 like me , they were not so tired. And we were 
there ma ybe for four mo nths. So we were 
on the fresh air. They said that the -- 
Q: So you spent the night there?  You lived there? 
A: Yeah, they gave us a -- 

Q: Oh. 

A: -- little room for five people, and once a day 
they -- th-the housekeeper ma ke the best for the 
food, that we were not hungry. And on the fresh 
air and from time to time we can catch a -- a 
carrot to eat, a -- and we were 
a little bit strong, y
eah. And ma ybe it saved 
our lives, but -- later 
on. But they also, one of our people, of the girls,
 they -- she wa nt to go to the bathroom, and it 

was far away the yard, and it was 
a little bit too dark, and she went
 to the bathroom on the yard, 
and all of a sudden, you know who s e nt a dog to her,
 and the dog went after 
her and bite her in 
the foot, and she start to shout and cry very mu
ch. From that time I was afraid for a dog for a 
long, long time. And then she came to us and we tr
ied to ma ke a disinfection and to help her. 
Such things happen. And still, when the four or 
five months fi nished, th
e winter came , and they 
se -- they send us back to Stutthof. And this wa
s really a terr ible time. But being there in the 
room by our self, we wash ourself, we hold ourse
lves clean, we wasn™t so hungry. But when we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
77 
 
came he -- back, and they put us back to Stutt
hof again, one in each other, where people were 
dying terrible, it was dysenteria, it was typhus, it 
was all kind of sickness. And we went to sleep 
and we wake up in the mi ddle of the night, Luta
 waked up first, and we
 were terrible surround 
with lice. Big, I ma  -- the lice were this big. And 
there were not a -- and Lu
ta star t to cry, sta -- 
Rochola this is our end, this we™ll not survive an
d we don™t know how to clean up for -- from it. 
And we were here a couple of nights, and they 
sit at -- the girls who came with us start to cry, 
water, water. We  didn™t have the water. After an
 hour, one is dead. Again 
another, water, water, 
she has the same condition as me, she was also
 working for the -- but she came out and ma ybe 
the typhus catched her very badl
y during a night or two. And peopl
e were running and they were 
picked up right away and they disappeared. We  we
re five, we were 10 around, we were eight, we 
are seven, we are [indecipherable]. Th
is is -- we™re sure that the end, 
we™ll die from the si -- from 
the sickness for -- during the day where we went 
to stay for raba -- we™re out, they counted. 
Some times they count in the room, and some ti me
s we went out outside. You see there were less 
and less and less, and we saw girls we  were so 
strong and nice and happy at the -- at the far m. 
All of a sudden they go, and th-th-they have 
diarrhea and we see the wagon came and put it on 
the wagon -- wagon and took them to the [indecipherable] and home  because there was such a 
place where they took the sick people
 and they -- of course they s
hot them right away. For a little 
while we were there, and all of a sudden me  a
nd Luta find out that they need people to clean 
potatoes for the -- for the camp. Come, she said, 
come . And I was so upset, I didn™t have any 
more energy. But I said we have to go some
, we have to do some th
ing. We went out and 
some how they pick us out a -- pi ck us up to the pl ace where we are cleaning the potatoes for the 

camp. And a group of people, all of a sudden -- the worst were the wome n Nazis. They came, 

they were so bad. The men also was bad, but 
-- but not so terrible as the wo me n. And I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400

wondering, how can a wome n, a wome n be so ba
d, but they were. We  were cleaning the 
potatoes, a group of ma ybe 150, or maybe hundred, 
I don™t reme mber how a
ll. All of a sudden 
some body c a me , the Ge rmans, and threw the potatoes, 
wherever it fall, it fall. To your head, to 
our face, or -- who catched it, catched it. One time
 was such a story. A little girl, she came  not 
far, they bought her from Hungary -- Hungary. 
[indecipherable]. And she came, and she also 
came to the potato [indecipherable] but she was 
-- she was looking well, sh
e was a healthy -- she 
was not so long in the camps as we. And she was -- and all of a sudden a German, drunk German 
came, look very good, and they were around, goi
ng around, drunk. And all of a sudden he came  
to the girl, and he start to talk
 to her, and she get [indecipherabl
e] sudden, she was afraid. And all 
of a sudden he gave her a pick and put her on he
r -- on her knees. Sit -- he sits where she was, 
and put her on her knees. And she did so, you know, fr
ightened. And he start to talk to her, and 
all of a sudden such a n -- Nazi woman came i
n. And she saw it and she gave her a slap and she 
start to beat her up. Whore, she star
t to talk to her, with all the 
terrible w-words, and she put her 
away. What she do -- did with her, I don™t know, 
she killed her, she [indecipherable]. And he 
was laughing. 

Q: So at this point you™re peeling po
tatoes in Stutthof. What -- what -- 
A: After that. 

Q: -- what come s after that, yes. 

A: After that, they put it to another place, us, 
the people who peel the -- in another room, who 
were from wood ma king such beds, one after the 
other, so everyone has his own place to sleep. 
They gave us better to eat, and we have much 
better conditions. And after that, after awhile, they 

start to evacuate the camp of Stutthof. It was January. We  didn™
t have any clothes, we didn™t 
have any shoes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
79 
 
Q: You didn™t have shoes? 
A: Yeah, they were rip, the -- you know, was so
 ma ny years we wearing the same  shoes. And 
people were evacuated. And other 
people want to go out, they want
 to be evacuated, too. And I 
said to Luta, Luta, I am not going now. The -- it™s
 very cold, the weather 
is terrible. We can get 
frozen on the mi ddle of the -- we were evacuat
e through the forest, it™s around, around forest. 
And I said it™s very dangerous to go. Let™s wait 
a little bit. She said, no, 
better to go, I said no, I 
am not going in the end of January. It™s very co
ld, and we™ll stay a little bit longer, and we 
stayed. 

Q: Alone? 

A: No, other people. They took a group, as much 
as they can take on a -- on a train, and no, not 
on train, by foot. They evacuate ther
e by foot, through the forest. A lit
tle bit farther, because the -
- the front. They -- they™re losing the war, and it 
came  nearer and nearer to the place we were. 
But in the beginning of ma r -- March, or in the 
ever end of the February, when the sun was a 
little bit shining, we deci
ded to go. And they evacuated us and 
brought us to a little camp. And in 
the little camp, the manager fr om the camp, the German was the one who was the chief in 

Strassenhoffer, we were in Riga, the same  pers
on, and he recognized us. We were there almost 
for a year, for 11 month. And he start to shout, my Juden, my Juden. Give them the plac -- the 

best place. And they gave us a room where we were
 sitting. They gave us from time to time what 
to eat. We  didn™t work, we only sit there. And in th
at time my feet start to be sl -- swollen and 
Luta will start to cry because that we™ll ha ve 
-- we have dysentery, and we  -- you™ll ha ve typhus, 
you have -- you -- you are dying, you [indecipherable]. 
I said, don™t cry, I will not di e, it will go 
away. And we were there sitting for ma ybe a wee
k, or what. And then they said -- one evening 
they came and they with big balls with water, so
me thing inside. And they said, you have to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
80 
 
off all your clothes. Leave only very little thing 
to cover the self, and the blanket. And you have 
to put in to ma ke an [indecipherable] it means a 
disinfection to get rid of
 lice or some thing. And 
there were robes over us, and then you™ll dry it on
 these rocks there. The 
clothes. I was in -- I 
didn™t have a choice, we did it,
 and we were covered with bl
ankets, and everyone some thing on 
them, that™s all. They were all wome n. Then we
 dry it out and we put over us. It was in the 
morning [indecipherable] in the mor ning. About tw
o o™clock at night they
 said you have to put 
on your clothes, and we are evacuating the camp. 
But everything was wet. But we didn™t have a 
choice. We  put on the we t o -- clothes, and we surround us with the blankets. And it wa s a 
terrible night, it was snowing, it™s ma r -- it wa
s March, the ninth of March. It was snowing, it 
was cold, and Luta says I can™t, I can™t go. And 
I look, she was burning. I said Luthishka, come , 

the end is soon, the end is -- we will not surv
ive, we will not survive. And we were going 
through the forest the whole night, 
frozen and exhausted and -- and it 
start to be a little bit light 
at six o™clock, five -- seven o™clock in the mo
rning. No, it was six, 6:30. And there was a little 
lake, and we were very thirsty, we
 wa nt to drink, and we went to 
the lake, they allowed us to go 
to the lake, and we were drinking right from th
e lake the water, and we were going again, again, 
until ma ybe seven, 6:30, and all of a sudden we stoppe
d, and we saw a big barn in the front of us. 
A stall. You know what it is. Where there is th
e food for the -- for the calfs. A stall.  
Q: A barn, mm-hm. 

A: A barn. And we were in the end of the group, 
and the soldiers were [indecipherable] fast, go 
faster, faster, schnella, schnella, schnella. But 
the people from before didn™t move, and we don™t 
know what to do, and we were exhausted, we were w
eak. And they said farther, farther, farther. 
And we couldn't understand, but finall
y we get in. What happened, in 
this barn, this
 stall was full 
of people who went [indecipherable]
 before, and were living there,
 and lot of them were with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
81 
 
frozen legs and backs, it was crowded, and they
 don™t want to move, they don™t have what to 
move, and the new people stepped on their stomach
s, on their -- on their f
eet, on their -- and it 
took a lot of time until we settled on each other.
 And we couldn™t fall asleep, ma ybe somehow 
we fall asleep we didn™t feel it, and in the morn
ing, usually about nine, 10 
o™clock, they used to 
bring us some  food. They, not we, we were ne
w. And they saw that nobody bought us anything. 
Then they opened the yard -- they could bur
n us, I don™t know why they didn™t, cause nobody™s 
around. No sign of kitchen, no sign of food, no si gn of
 -- o-o-of their soup what they bring. And 
there were some  brave pe ople and it™s -- was far 
away, the place was called fino. I reme mber we 
went through the part and we saw in the little 
houses it was light, it was ni
ce and we want to go 
in to see how it™s life. And we were [indeciphera
ble]. And these brave three wome n went to see 
what™s doing. And it™s was far away from the ro
ad. They went, it was an hour they got back, 
ma ybe two, two and a half hour. They came back
 surround with -- with 
-- with all kind of 
clothes, and you know?  And they said, we are 
free. Nobody™s around. I -- we went ma ybe for a 
mile, two, and nobody™s around. All that we see, vacan
ce, with food, with clothes left alone and 
nobody™s there. Then the whole barn, who -- all that
 could, took their blanke
ts that their clothes 
were still wet, without hair, and you can™t imagine 
what it was, and we went all together to the 
road we went, a mile, two miles. And all of 
a sudden we saw the sound of tanks, the sound of -- 
o-of -- of cars, the sound -- and th
e people like they were going, they 
went right away to that -- to 
the tanks where the -- the -- they 
are going, and they didn™t look at
 anything, they went in the -- 
to the road, and they st opped the whole -- the 
whole procession of the -- of the military. And I 
was stand up for awhile, and I said, my God, do I l
ook like all the people? And Luta said me  -- is 
very bad. I have a terrible headache. And sh
e was burning like she -- I don™t know how high up 
temperature went. I am hungry, I want to lay 
down. And I was stopped for awhile and I look to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
82 
 
the crowd at the people. I thought, yes, ma ybe we  
were liberated, but it™s
 too late. We  are all 
crazy. We  are not norma l people. Sorry. Other pe
ople went to the wagon, they find food and start 
to eat, and they got diarrhea and they were d
ead right away, after th
e liberation. And I didn™t 
look at th-thi s, any [indecipherabl
e] anything of that because it ar
en™t interesting, I want a place 
for Luta to [indecipherable]. And we went to -- 
to a soldier, an officer, and we ask him, can you 
put us into a house with my sister very sick?  An
d he said come  with us, and another 10 people 
c o me  w i t h  u s .  I  r e me mb e r  t h i s ,  L u t a  r e me mb e r e d
 it a little bit different, 
but I see it like it was. 
And we ca me to a little German house, and 
an old person, maybe for 90 was along -- around, and 
the officer, the Russian officer came, ﬁOpen your
 house and let the people in. What did you do 
from people?  Look what you do -- did to people.ﬂ He
 opened the house, and we went in to a little 
house, clean, nice, the table was se
rved. I think that the 
Germans served it for breakfast and they 
had to run right away. With the beautiful beds
, with the nice blankets. Like the country, you 
know, home . And first of all I put her to the bed, 
she was burning. And then soldiers came  in and 
a lot of people here and there and this was our lib
eration. Like a little [inde
cipherable] first of all 
we went to have a shower.

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Di -- so you were aware th
at you were being liberated? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. That what I told you. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I said that it™s too late, 
because the people how they looked, how they behaved, how we were 

thrown ourself to the tanks, and to the -- not thin
king that there is a possi
bility they couldn™t stop 
right away. But, you know.  

Q: And how did the Russians treat you ap -- ther
 -- I™ve heard some  stories that some  of the 
Russian troops were alwa ys respectful. 

A: I™ll tell -- I™ll 
tell you. They™re different people, and di
fferent Russians, like different people 
all over.  
Q: So did you stay at the -- at 
the house and take care of Luta? 
A: No. There were more people, she has a good be
d, and -- and all of a su
dden they came , that 
the ho -- the hospital that is the same town is a 
hospital and there ar e lots
 of sick soldiers, and 
refugees and there no people to take care of them
. And who only could, we re go to work there. 
After a week I went to work, to
 the hospital for a couple of hours,
 and I was taking care of Luta, 
and she was in bed, she was still feeling bad, she 
was still, but sh-she has a bed. She was in bed, 
she was -- but she didn™t have any medicine, we
 didn™t have anything. And I hoped that she™ll be 
better and better and better. She™ll get a little be
tter and then [indeciphe
rable]. And after three 
weeks or a month, the soldiers came and they said
 that this earth where we  are now, has to be 
given away to Poland or to German or to ru 
-- and who wants to return to his homeland, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
84 
 
where they came , they have to go to the trains, 
and they™ll go back to Li
thuania, to Russia. And 
as we decided with our family, that we™ll meet af
ter the war in Wilna, we tried to go to Wilna. 
Other people were older than we, they wer -- were 
more -- they thinking a better way. They want 
to go to the other side, not to ru
 -- to return to Russia. They 
know what -- knew what Russia was 
and I didn™t knew it. I had a good time there in Russia 
being a kid. So we decide to go to Wilna, 
maybe we™ll meet somebody from 
our friends. And we went through Poland, but I heard that all 
my fa mily perished during the resi stant in Wa
rsaw ghetto. And I was mi s t aken, only my brother-
in-law perished. My sister survive, but I didn™t know that. So we went to the wagons to go to 

Lithuanian. When we came to the border [indeciphera
ble] soldiers came in
 and said, who doesn™t 
have any docume nts have to go out. We were 
very tired, Luta was sick, and we were going 
together with the Russian soldiers, with Russian
 officers. And they said, you know what girls?  

There in the back are some bags 
with -- with -- with co
rn, with some  ba -- go behind them. Don™t 
go out. Whe r e we™ll go again to a 
center that -- for the people [i
ndecipherable] you will come  to 
Wilna, to your city, you™ll find some  friends, a
nd you™ll got your docume nts. And we listened to 
that, and we went and we™re hi
ding. And we didn™t go out to the 
border, to the centers wer -- 
were gathered the people without docume nt. 
And we came t o Kovno [indecipherable] we ca me  
to Kovno, we went out. And there were Jewish peopl
e, they saw us, because they were liberated 

at -- almost a year ago. 10 year -- 10 months
 ago. And they saw, oh you came from the camp, 

from the camp where -- and I remember that some
 people were working in a bath house, a place 
where people came to wash themself. And they put us
 there, and they gave us a room there, and 
they brought us food, and we wash ourself. We  we
re cleaner because we were in the German 
house, so we wash ourself, we were cleaner beca
use we were in the German house, so we wash 
ourself and we changed our clothes,
 and so we were not so dirty, we
 almost have a little bit view 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
85 
 
as -- as people. But still they hair didn™t grow 
up, for sha -- such a short 
-- and there we were for 
ma ybe a we ek, and we want to go back to Wilna. 
We  ca me  [i ndecipherable] rest a little bit whe -
- and somebody -- somebody from Wilna ca me, and they
 gave us a report and they told us about 
the Shreyber fa mily that they died, and the -- Josef 
is not alive, my fa mily
 is not alive. I had a 
cousin who was alive, but he left already for the United States. And so you go to Wilna. 
[indecipherable] we came to -- we wa nted to go fr
om Kovno to Wilna, what 
is an hour and a half 
by train, they didn™t let us. Where is -- are your 
documents?  We said we don™t have docume nts. 
Then go back to the border where is the center 
of the people who doesn™t have docume nt. I said, 
we will not go. And a couple of days we go into th
e train and they put us out. We were in and 
they put us out and they take 
us to the police and 
the police said, how did you survive?  Did you 
work with the Germans?  And 
I said, my God, I thought that 
everybody will be happy that some  
people survive after so ma ny sufferi -- suffering. 
And then what should we  do, how can we come  

to Wilna, that it™s so close that we can™t 
ha -- here we don™t know anybody, there we™ll find some  
-- some  people who came from the partisans, or 
who were hiding, we™ll find them. And then we 
came to the machinist from the train and we ask him bring us to Wilna. We are comi ng to the 

train and we are throw out again, we are comi ng 
again. Is -- the only thing what we can do for 
you, sit down in the front where the machinery is, 
not inside, and this way he™ll [indecipherable] 
so we didn™t have a choice, me  and Luta, and 
Luta was se-sent in the front, and we came to 
Wilna. We went out for the -- from the train. We  
didn't recognize each other, we were from the 
coal -- from the -- we were da -- dark, w-with 
all the stuff, with all the dust. And we came to 
Ponarski Street where Luta used to live, but 
she -- everybody stranger. We
 ca me  to a yard, and 
they came to the f -- second floor. We  saw that th
is was a Jewish fa mily, and we knocked in to 
the door. And they opened the door, and knocked it back. They saw the people, they get afraid. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
86 
 
Knocked at the seven -- a second time . I said, pl
ease, you don™t want to let 
us in, bring us some  
water and a little soap to wash our faces. We  ca
me at the train on the top and we get dirty. We  
want to clean up ourselves to co
me to the center of the city. So
 they took out the bowl of water 
with the little piece -- 
so they were not -- they were afraid, 
they were the Je wish people, but they 
were not fr -- they didn™t understand the situatio
n. They had the norma l life ma ybe for  a year. 
And maybe they came from Russia, from evacuati
on. Anyway, they give us the water, and we 
wash ourselves and we wiped out, and -- a little bit.
 And we went to the cen
ter of the -- li -- Luta 
came to her yard where she lived, everything 
was wiped out, her house, and she didn™t find 
anybody from people she knew. And we went to th
e center, and there wa
s a librar -- a Jewish 
library and some  offices. And some  people cam
e out and they recognized us. And th -- oh 
[indecipherable] some  pe ople take us to their house 
and we were afraid to come  in, we were still 
so dirty, we -- we didn™t have 
anything, we didn't have money and we didn™t know the language 
because Russian we don™t know, we learned a little 
bit. See, Luta knew, but not me . And she was 
very sick, she was very sick. And some body took us
 to their house, and it 
was clean, it was nice, 
it was white, and we didn™t know where to sit down. You know, we were still dirty. And then a 

friend of mi ne who li-lived over 
[indecipherable] has an apartment, three of them, one  -- and 
they said, oh we™ll clean up a 
little room for you, and you™ll come
, you™ll live with us. And they 
cleaned up a little room of ours, she gave me  a dr
ess, and Luta a dress, 
we change a little bit. 
And then I heard a brother of my 
brother-in-law from my second si
ster, oh -- he find out that we 
came, and he took us to his apartment. He took us
 into his apartment, but Luta was feeling very, 
very bad. And they find out -- a doctor, not [inde
cipherable] they came to him and they ask him 
to look at her and he said she has to go to the 
hospital. And she went into the hospital, she was 
for three months in the hospital, and they didn'
t know what™s wrong with her. And finally they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0400  
87 
 
find out that she has an open cover tuberculosis on
 her -- and she was maybe 
for a year in a tute -
- institute. She was 17 at the time . And then, one of her friends, her husband came  fr om the 
army, and th -- we were on the summer house [i ndeci
pherable] with him, or the friend from the 
fa mily. He was a couple of years older than he, a
nd he fall in love with her, and he was taking 
care of her very -- I -- very much, even when 
she was very, very sick. And she was with the 
tuberculose over a year. Everybody was liberated, I 
was working, trying to support her. And her -
