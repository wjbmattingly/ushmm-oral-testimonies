TEOFIL KOSINSKI 
November 8, 1995 
 
Question: Can you tell us your name  and wh
ere you come  from and when you were born? 
Answer: Yes, I do this.  My name  is Teofil Ko
sinski, Polish, but for Americans it ma y be a 
little difficult to pronounce, Kosinski, 
so it's better I say Toffi Kosinski. 
 I was born in Poland, in Torran.  This is a 
Polish name , and in German it was Torran.  I 
was born on the first of January 1925, so 
in one month I will be 71 years old. 
Q. Did you go to school also in To
rran and what did your parents do? 
A. I finished my ordinary school
, seven classes, in Torran.  My
 parents -- my father worked 
on the railroad and my mother worked 
from time to ti me  cleaning some houses. 
 We were together fi ve children and my mother
 and father.  Until the war, until the fi rst of 
February 1929, we were living in the railroad bl
ocks.  We  had three room
s, but two rooms were 
rented always because the salary of my fath
er was very low to feed the whole family. 
Q. You speak also very well German.  Why?  

A. You see, in Torran were ma ny Ger man people. 
 Even my par e nts had to go to the school, 
to German s c hool so that before the war I learne
d a little German from German people, and just a 
little home because from time to time my parents if they wanted to speak in secret s before me  

they tried to speak in German.

Q. And do you understand what they were telling? 
A. No, no, I couldn't.  I was so angry.  "M
amma , why you speak?"  And she laughed and it 
was so funny, but then when Hitler came I had to 
try to speak and to le
arn because I knew that 
was very important for me. 

Q. How were you raised -- in 
which religion were you raise 
A. I was catholic.  I am catholic and that's all.
  I was educated in th
is religion.  When I was 
going to the school -- we had also because in Torr
an were some  Jews.  I had two friends at my 

school but during the religi
on lesson they went out. 
Q. Do you remember their name s?  

A. In Torran school not, but later I had so me  fr
iends after the war that I me t.  Titleba um.  

He's now in Israel.  He left Israel in 1968 probabl
y he's still alive.  Maybewhen I will be in Israel 
I will fi nd him.  It will be a great pleasure for me. 

Q. I don't know Torran at all.  Can you desc
ribe how it looked dur
ing your childhood when 
you grew up and your family --? 

A. Yes, I try.  It was a wonderful time.  It st
ill is wonderful, very old city.  Some  people 
called this town ___________.  It is fr om the old 
century, mi ddle age city.  A most gothic, 
beautiful old churches and the music house also ve
ry nice.  This place, the Torran was the place 
born _________________.  It was very fa mous.  You reme mber ma ybe or you know some thing 

before the wa r Hitler had in the pl ace of 
_______________, before it was a corridor, they called 
it, the train passed from Germany through Torran to
 Dank.  So, me , as a child, I ran very often 
this train.  I followed.  I asked for sweets some thing and the Germans ga ve me. 

Q. Do you remember in your early childhood, lik
e when you went to school, was there any 
tensions between yourself, catholic, or Jews 
in Torran, or did you never notice anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

A. No, I noticed.  In Torran, not very Jews but the Jews that are, are very kind and very 
good.  Even we, we ma de shopping by compa
ny by ___________.  My father was, as I told you, 
a railroad worker, so if we like to buy some
thing, some  dressing, some  clothing, we received 
from hi m especially ___________.  It was very conve
nient for us because cash to pay it was very 
difficult.  I played with the two boys and I went ho
me  and I like the cuisine,
 the Jewish cuisine.  
We had some restaurants and to me  personally 
when I was young, I worked not only be German 
I had it also to some  Jews some  restaurants only -- I me t with them shopping.  So, I had money 

because I should never holidays, instead to go like
 holidays like all the children to spend a nice 
time I had to work. 

Q. Your fa mily didn't have a lot of money? 

A. No, I told you.  Even my mother -- we  ha
d three rooms, nice rooms but one room was 
always rent ed.  They were given to the window fo
r rent.  It was also not good because sometimes 
they changed.  Some times it was very good, some
times it was very bad.  Sometimes s he didn't 
receive money for it.  It depends
 there are different people.   
Q. And you we nt to school -- 
how was your school career? 
A. You see, I finished this ordinary school.  
It was exactly in 1939 and I reme mber in June.  
Then my par e nts wanted me , personally, because 
I had not talent but I ha d very good knowledge 
and the teacher said to my mother and to my fa
ther that it should be very good when they send 

me  to the gymnasium.  And my parents decided our
 son mu st finish just a little high school. So, I 

tried to ma ke examination and I passed very 
good notes.  I wa s the third on the list, and my 
mother ordered a new suit for the gymnasium.
  I had the uniform and we couldn't pay 
imme diately so we ordered it exactly like my
 __________so the suit could be paid for for a few 
months.  Then came the war and I never went to th
e gymnasium.  I never wear this nice uniform.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

I gave it back to this tailor because  I didn't us
e it and we couldn't pay.  So, my further education 
was fi nished.  Since the war it was absolutely fo
rbidden for the Polish peopl
e to go to the school. 
Q. Do you remember the day in 1939?   Can you tell us exactly? 
A. Of course, I reme mber very well.  It wa
s on the third of September, morning --no it was 
on the first of September.  I was in the ma rket. 
 Usually I went very early before going to the 
school, and I helped some  Ger man far mers to put 
vegetables on the ma rket.  They paid me  also 
with some  vegetables and it was very hard for 
my mother.  I returned
 home .  We heard the 
signals and my mother said, "Oh my  God, the wa
r began."  She has seen -- ma ny people had seen 
a cross on the sky oral like this
 because my mother spent the first war, she had the experience 
and she said, "No, never in our life a 
second war."  But the second war began. 
 And then, on the third of September, it was Sund
ay, I'll never forget it.  My father has to 
go to Wa rsaw to fight against the Germans.  He 
has received three months
 salary.  He left his 
money to my mother.  My mother took the money. 
 She took special -- 
not in paper money only 
in coins, use silver because she said she had experience.  Paper money would not be va lid.  The 

coins will be valid, just silver. 

 So, the third of September, from our fa mily
 from village they came with the horse and 
how we call it this car --
 with horse, and they took us from
 the village because everybody afraid 
that they will come, the bombs will come, and we wa
nt to be hidden ther e so that we went to the 

village with our fa mily with our family to be 
more surely there than in the city of Torran. 
Q. Did you return to Torran? 

A. Not so early.  First me , brother, everybody, we were there and the village but ma ybe aft e r 

two weeks after we heard that in
 Torran are the German sol diers, my mother aske d me  and my 
older brot her has to go to this house and try to pr
ove that   everythi ng is okay because during the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
5 
 
absence could happen everything.  We had returne
d.  We  seen soldiers, some  soldiers in the 
beginning we re very kind.  They tried to give soups and  
breads because in the soups we 
had nothing.  I took some  br eads ev
en and I went by foot with 
my brother to the village and I told mother, "Com
e on.  There is no reason to sit here.  We must 
go home .  The soldiers ar e not so bad.  Maybe the war will be  not so long."  And we returned to 

the same place to the nice house where we lived before. 

Q. Did you stay in this
 house during the war? 
A. Oh, only ma ybe two mo nths we were living 
there in the same house, but then once they 
came there, the soldiers, by some patrol, I co
uldn't recall because I was very young, and said you 
must leave this house.  Oh my 
mother began to cry but where ar
e we to go.  We  are living so 
long here.  Don't ma ke a ________. You must leav
e.  We  are giving you a few hours time but 
first she would like to know where.  You will receive a good flat.  We  went with my brother.   

We had seen this replacement for us. It     was 
terrible, but it wa s what we had to do.  It was an 
order.  So, we tried to take as much as was possi
ble and we went to this 
new house.  It wasn't  a 
house, maybe it should be called shed maybe becau
se it wa only -- we had three rooms and now 
my mother said it is more easier to move from 
a worse place to better than to on the contrary, 
from the better to the worse.  Here it was 
only one room hous e, with small kitchen, a dark 
kitchen.  There was no water inside
.  There was no water, toilet 
outside, no cellar, nothing, but 
what we had to do was to leave and to stay a
nd thank God we had receiv
ed this because some  
people they were put on the street. 

Q. Why had you to leave the 
house and how ma ny other people 
had to leave the houses in 
Torran?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
6 
 
A. The only reason was that we are Polish.  This 
was the reason.  It was too nice to us.  They 
put it imme diately German fa milies from Ger many.  Some time, because we  were living in -- 
across some times we look out the window.  It was ve
ry difficult to just liv
ing here and the people 
from Ger ma ny took our flat.   

Q. How did you support yourself and how did the family support themselves in the 

following months? 

A. Usually all young people were sent to the fo
rce camp to Germany.  My brother -- before 
the war was one or two years he  
learned not as baker for some sweet things, but baker and so he 
worked by this baker and once he came  to me  
he  said you see, it's better you take the job by 
____________.  It is also baker and I have some  frie
nds there.  It will be very good job and 
maybe it you will not go to Germany to the force camp. 

 And I went to this bakery.  I reme mb er he 
was very nice tall ma n.  I didn't speak so good 
German.  I tried to speak German but  this Germ
an he was living in Poland so he could speak 
Polish too.  First, he refused to sp
eak Polish but when he seen that 
I try   but I couldn't he started 
with me  speak Polish.  I told him that we have ve
ry difficult situation.  My father is not here.  I 

have younger sisters and brother.  
We  have to help mother.  I w
ould like to work because I heard 
that there is wanted a boy his 

bakery.  He called his wife.  
She looked at me  probably I was good for -- I looked well.  She 
agreed and soon I was employed there as a delivery 
boy.  This kind of job I ha
d to go by bicycle.  
I had on my back a basket with bread and every mo
rning very early I brought this bread to some  
German hos pitals, to German shops and to some  private houses. 

Q. Were you disappointed that you were not al
lowed to go to school?   How old were you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
7 
 
A. I heard this immediately. 
 It was written, we had ma ny ti me s some  special how you call 
this on the streets, ther e was written, at the first 
in the beginning it was wr itten in German and in 
Polish_____________.  I don't know in English how it was.  I went 
 

to the school but the door was closed and it was 
only for German children.  I knew immediately I 
couldn't go. 

Q. Were you disappointed? 

A. Of course because I was so glad I started to
 study.  I wanted to be as we called in Poland, 
even in Torran, one me nsch.  My mo ther, my father said I will take from a month and put to him 

for his schooling, one of our fa mily must be a me nsch.   I think in compa r ing with other people, 

it was ma ybe in the be ginning not so bad for us because as I told you I was working as a delivery 

boy for a baker.  So, I could receive even for 
my payment, my salary was not so high.  I 
reme mber it was only five marks per week, but I 
received some bread and it was very important 
because the food was rationed es
pecially for Polish people.  
We had received -- what I 
reme mber, there was one pound of meat per mo nt
h including bones.  You can understand it was 
nothing.  It was with some  soldiers also.  Some
times we wondered she prepared some dishes, of 
course meat was ma ybe two or once per month, but sh
e prepared this or that
 so things that my 
ma ma, she was very practical and we  were 
not hungry.  In the be
ginning I thought and my 
brother bought so that our fa mily didn't be hungry. 

Q. You said there were Polish people from To
rran sent from Germany.  Do you reme mb er 
stories, do you know people who were 
sent to Germany for forced labor? 
A. Oh, yes.  Even my friends from 
the school they were sent to _________________.  For 
the first time I had received letters, I also have at 
home  he sent me  picture how he had to work in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

_____________, how very hard, and very -- they had here
 a -- Polish, this is
 in Poland and he 
wrote me so that I could read th
e conditions were very, very hard. 
 So, therefore I tried to do my 
best only to stay to work for this ba
ker inst ead to go there, to Germany. 
Q. Did he write you where he was -- was he ki
nd of imprisoned in a work camp or did he 
work for --? 
A. That was forced labor, ___________.  He was sent, ma ny Pol i sh people were sent.  Some  

of Polish families were sent to this ___________.  
It's called because we were born in Torran.  

Who was born in Torran the Germans they kept th
em there, but who wasn't  born there, they sent 
to the district _________________.  Maybe it was better. 
 We  would like also to go there, but we 
couldn't.  We had to stay in Torran. 

Q. Do you know why?  

A. Why we had to stay?  I 
don't know, ma ybe they wanted to make us German.  I don't 
know.  I don't know why. 
Q. Those friends of yours who were se
nt to ____________, where did they live in 
___________? 
A. Oh, I never seen him.  Then I went
 -- my study later, I never seen him. 
Q. But when he did write the letter, di
d he tell you -- did 
he live in a house? 
A. Oh, no, together with horses.  Together with horses.  Their food was very bad.  They had 

to take hi m from the fields some row of carrots or
 this to feed because they were so hungry.  You 
see, I tried to do everything not only to go there.  
Some  of them they escaped but when they were 
caught, they put them in the prison. 

Q. How old we re you when you started to work for the German baker and did you stay 

working for him all the time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
9 
 
A. Yes, I tell you.  When I was fourteen years 
old I worked for this baker, and I worked, let's 
see, 1941, I worked there.  But it was so that
 during the war for young people, no chance, life 
was so boring we couldn't go -- there was cinema
 but for German people only.  There was the 
arts but for German people only.  We had nothi
ng.  We had to stay home from eight o'clock 
evening until six o'clock in the morning.  It wa
s how we call curfew.  You couldn't walk.  You 
can't  imagine.  It is summer, a very nice time.  Ev
ening it's dark first at 10:00 and you have to be 
home.  What we have done.  There was a small 
place, we took our chairs, from all people, we 
were sitting there to spend in the fresh air becau
se we couldn't go on the street.  One time  when I 
was delivering the bread to the hospital, I pass, al
ways the theater.  I was very keen for theater 
because I like very much music.  I like to sing, ev
en in the school.  And then I have seen there 
was written "Chorus singers wanted."   I think 
"Oh my God, ma ybe I could go there."  First I 

wonder and ask was me  as a Polish can I do it.  
They look at me  because I'm very young.  I was 
16 years old and first he said, "You 
want to be singer?   You still 
have this mutation, this change 
of voice."  I said, "No, no, I finish my mutation. 
 I would like to sing."  
Okay.  We  e mploy also 
Poles, but the examination will be at this and this 
time.  I asked to write to fill my name and after 

two days I went there.  I reme mber Mr. Veber, 
not so old, but a very good ma n and he gave the 
examination, first on the piano and then he as
ked me  sing something. German songs I didn't 
know and I asked, "May I sing Polish?"  "Yes. You 
can do this."  I never forget I sang a very 

nice Polish old song.  He liked it. 
 It was very nice.  I translate 
it soon as I could and he said to 
me , "Go a w ay, wait."  I don't know.  Maybe he
 asked some body. Maybe the commission ma kes 
some  discussion.  Anyhow, after one hour he said
 okay, you will be our chorus singer.  Your 
voice is correct, very good, only the 
question you must work here only 
as an extra task.  It will 
not be ma in work.  I didn't  understand what he
 meant.  You will work afternoon and evening and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
10 
 
the other job you have you must keep it.  Okay, I ag
reed.  I went home.  I said to my mother, my 
mother, oh, it will be  too difficult for you, tw
o jobs.  And ma ybe the _________ will not be 
satisfied that you are working in theater.  The nigh
t will be too short for you.  But I insisted, my 
mother, it will be everything okay.  I will keep th
is job and this job and believe me it will be 
possible.  Okay, do as you like.  And so I wo
rked in theater and I worked in the bakery. 
Q. You stayed working for the baker?    

A. Not all time, but in the beginning I was work
ing yes, I was working bakery and theater.  
The theater was very nice.  I like this climate, th
is atmosphere.  There were dancers, singers, nice 
people.  In the theater you could forget, you see, 
the war, and especially for me , I had no chance, 
nothing, no cafes, just no -- it was war time  bor
ing.  During the evening it was dark, closed 
house, no gas lamps nothing.  Wa r. Exactly war.  
So, when I was working in the theater it was 
everything good, but in my job happened some thi
ng very wrong.  Because as they told you you 
reme mber when I was employed by the baker the 
woma n, his wife, came  to me .  She looked at 
me  and then later I knew what for.  The age of her husband and the woma n was very big 

difference.  She was younger and probably she 
wa s bigger and more demand in the month for 
love.  She used me  as a boy not only for delivery of
 bread but also of the 
delivery love letters to 
her lovers.  In the beginning it was everythi
ng good but some thing happened very, very wrong.  
When I went with this letter, 
open it, a woma n.  She said, "Wha
t are you doing.  You're trying to 
ma ke -- break my ma rriage."  And I ran away.  I to
ld  -- I said in German "Meist er, and she said 
"Yes did you --"  No, I have this.  Good that 
you haven't given this but ma ybe she can recognize 
you because Torran was very small.  Everybody knew us
.  And then in this mo me nt s he tried to 
do everything that will go out from t his job. 
 My mother, the me ister, everybody was wondering 
why.  It was always so good, but I knew later that
 the reason was that she was afraid that ma ybe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
11 
 
there will some blackma il.  The man will be kno
w about her and okay.  
I was looking for a new 
job.  It was very, very difficult to find a very easy
 job.  But I found it as an ordinary worker.  It is 
in German a ________________.  You can translate this 
into English.  I reme mber the name  it 
was Hanz Kruger.  I agree and I was working there.
  I said imme diately that I cannot stay very 
long only until 3: 00 because then I have to exercise s 
in the theater.  They appreciated ve ry much.  
At first they were very anxious, curious that 
Polish people and I said 
"No, I'm just a chorus 
singer, nothing more."  And so I worked
 ther e and I worked in the theater. 
Q. But Polish people were not allowed to be on the street after 8:00? 
A. Yes. 

Q. But you had to work in the theater some ti me s in the evening? 

A. Yes, you are right.  Before I accepted the th
eater because they told
 me  you will work here 
nights, performa nces until 10:00 and you will receiv
e a special pass for the night.  I received a 
pass from 8: 00 until 12:00.  I was very funny and 
very proud, but it was not for other people not 
good.  Other people you can imagine.  They are si
tting.  They are waiting 
and I'm coming at ten 
or eleven o'clock home.  They are wondering wh
at's happened.  Maybe he is a German now.  I 
couldn't explain to everybody that I have this 
permission.  At home  my
 mother knew.  My 
brother was not satisfied with this, 
and he wasn't  also satisfied that I was working in the theater.  
Maybe some friends, because he had ma ny friends
, and ma ybe they thought I was collaborating 
with Germa ns.  It was not a pleasant time for me , especially when I came  home  or when I passed 

a street when some body -- it happened also that
 my friends from the school some times when I 
passed they took the hat so on this side th
ey thought that ma ybe I'm collaborating. 
Q. Did your German also improve when you we
re working in theater?   Did you start to 
speak better German? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
12 
 
A. Yes, of course I had to because we ha d the exercises.  We  received a note and it was 
German.  I tried to learn the German better.  I 
asked my mother, my father, the gramma r.  My 
mother could speak but she couldn't explain me
 how it was gramma tically good.  Then I asked 
some ti me s Mr. Veber and he was very glad that I 
am so keen for this language.  He said, "Oh, 
you are a very clever boy.  In a short time you will speak fluently German."  It was not fluently 

but it was better and better, always better.  So, 
that's  and even when I was working with this 
baker, we went together and we
 ma de shopping with the wome n, with
 the me ister and I tried also 
to speak German or Polish.  She said we are going
 now to the German shop, try to speak German 
only.  And sometimes if I needed some
thing, _____________, then because we couldn't buy, 
except a small ration of food in the cart
, nothing, no ______________.  The Germans had some  
____________, it is permission for buying clothes, dres
ses or shoes.  We  had nothing. Once I 
reme mber she also went to a German shop and you see the boy this winter it's cold ma ybe you 

have some thing, and they put it to give because I 
talk to her German, ma ybe they took me as a 
German too. 

 Anyhow, I improve my German so much as
 possible sometimes the Germans couldn't 
recognize me that I was German, bec a use I used th
is night pass control for some  shopping.  For 
Germans there was everything, but
 at night, evening.  And I we
nt to those shops, I bought I 
reme mber it was mar malade, there was some not
 -- a kind of zwieback, some times there was 
some  fruit some  oranges, but ther
e was only two or three.  They w
ouldn't like to sell more so that 
I had use of this privilege of my pa
ss and I could buy a little to my mother. 
Q. Then when you worked for the theater you me t at one point some one who became very 

special? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
13 
 
A. Yes.  It was once when I left the theater 
I crossed usually the same place to make some 
shopping and I feel that some body watched me
.  At the mo ment I thought ma ybe some 
policeman because it was dark.  I di dn't  see.  I 
went and he followed me  and they see there is 
some  unifor m, some  soldier.  I didn't know what
 he wanted from me .  He  watched, but his 

watching was completely differently than usual.  
He s miled to me .  It never happened before and 
he started to ask some thing of me  and he
 said _________________, which means "this is a nice 
place"  and then hello, how are you?  What are 
you doing?   "I'm going home .  Shall we go home 
to drink some  coffee? "  I'm looking.  A Ger man i
nvited me  for coffee.  My hat was trembling I 
was so excited.  I didn't know maybe if I refuse
 him ma ybe s o me thing happen wrong.  I agree.  I 
went and then when we'r e inside, so, and you're
 out shopping.  "Your pa
rents are living here, 
fa mily?"  "Yes, my parents are living here.  My 
father is not here.  My father is I don't know, 
ma ybe in Ge rmany and I was born also here."  
You were born here?   You're not German?   No, 

I'm Polish.  Oh, God, what are you doing now."  I sa
id, "Don't worry.  I have the passport.  I am 
working theater.  I have the passpor t until 12:
00"  "Oh, God, that's  good, but ma ybe we  go out," 
because I think he was afraid my characteristic
, Ge rman speaking that somebody here that he 
speaks with me , there were not so ma ny people bu
t anyhow I knew that in 
the beginning when I 
spoke only a few words it was correct.  But I star
ted to speak more he felt that my accent was 
bad. 

 And we went out.  He asked me  in whic
h direction I'm going home .  I showed him 
because I was living not in the center of city, we 
were in suburb, very, very poor district.  Then 
when the evening he asked me , "May I see you agai
n? "  For the first time, I would like to me et 
you.  But he look always in eyes.  It was some thi
ng completely different than usual with all the 
German me n.  I asked why not, we can do this.  
"But where? " I asked.  You see, here, this

station.  It was in the railroad 
station in the mi ddle of the city. 
 It was a very good place.  Okay, 
but when?   You see I don't know when I'll receive the permission for going out because he was a 
soldier.  And I also, I don't know
 bec a use there we re differently 
plays, operetta, gypsy, a little 
longer, some times ____________ it is an operetta it was 
a little shorter.  We fixed exactly I 
reme mber it was after two days at the same place,
 and he came after my performa nce, he came.  

And then, I have to tell you we went -- I took h
im because I knew places. He asked me  whether I 
knew some  places because he is not so good to walk for him and for him,  especially for him 

ma ybe more because Polish people were not on the street.   

 And I found some  places we were standing there in the theater and he -- ma ybe I so 

exactly there is some  item but he pressed on and 
he said, "You look very nice.  You are a very 
boy."  Then he told me , "I'm not German."  
"You are not German?  Who a r e you then?"  "I'm 

Austrian.  "Austria, Vienna?   Yes, 
Vienna."  Then I feel a little be
tter.  It is completely different 
to like a German.   Have you me t in these places as
 a child.  As a child I played in some places.  I 
knew some .  It was destroyed in the war in 
the field there was some body watching as a guard. 
Let's go because it was cold.  I me t him it was on 
exactly the fourth of No
vember 1941.  It would 
snow.  It was cold.  I liked to
 wear shoes -- only small shoes 
and trousers with pump, here.  So, 
the snow -- the winter wa s so strong.  He took me 
to places for the first time like father and I was 
a child and it was very pleasant and then we went 
to the shed.  We  played.  It was roma ntic.  It 
was not so suffocating like now ma ybe, completely
 different.  Then when I went home , I couldn't 
sleep.  I dr eame d because it happened some thing with me  completely di fferent. 

Q. What happened?   What was different for you? 

A. Different for me , it changed my life.  I f
eel some thing, like love.  It was like love but 
don't think that there was real sex.  No.  Ther
e was playing, kissing, ma ybe the sex come s also, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
15 
 
of course, I was young, I feel it.  But and we 
had no possibilities but it was a very, very 
pleasurable time .  We  couldn't see each day as 
I told you because he could not receive every day 
the permission but so long he could he came a
nd he brought me  always 
s o me thing, some  sweet, 
some special ration card.  With this card I co
uld buy some  pas t ry because for Polish people it 
was absolutely forbidden to receive pastry but 
for his card especially evening when I went, I 
could receive it.  I received once even shoes beca
use he had seen that my shoes for the winter 
time was no good.  Home was big scandal, especially my brother. 
 My brother felt that there is some thing 
wrong because I brought shoes.  I br ought once 
shirt, inside shirt and he knew th
at this shirt was from soldier.  He asked me some thing, "What 's 
happened?   Don't worry.  What I am doing is my 
business."  Some times he was very angry.  He 
said I am older than you.  I promise Fath
er to take care of you so I must know. 
Q. Did you tell him?  

A. Not early.  La ter.  When that was so big 
that even my mother feel some thing happened 
with me, something, because I ask very often, 
"Mother I need white shirt."  My mother 
complained, "I have no soap.  You change every day.  I cannot wash.  Mother I must look very 

nice", but it was not for theater. It was for my 
friend.  His name was Willie Goetz.  I will never 
forget his name. 

 Because he was so sweet to me , I wanted also
 to be sweet and once they of course, when 
my brother drank a little, schnapps, that's a ki
nd of illegal vodka, we couldn't buy it but he had 
some  contacts.  Maybe later I will tell you.  I kn
ew he had to work.  He worked with some  
underground.  I never knew exactly, but he br
ought also some times schnapps probably from 
these pl aces. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

 I said to him, his name  was Casimi r, I sa
id, "Cashic, you must understand me .  I fall in 
love with soldier.  Oh my God, why?   Y
ou don't like women?   No, I like men like you like 
women.  I like men.  You must 
understand me .  No, this is only for the mome nt.  You'll find a 
girl probably, especially with Germa ny.  You know
 what's  happened.  It's  very dangerous.  No, 
it's not dangerous, it's  so good.  No, you can be sure. 
 You must stop this.  I'll tell mother.  Don't 
tell this mot her, I ask you very much.  Don't do t h
is."  He didn't  say this, but from this time he 
changed his behavior towards me .  And our rela
tion was not so open.  I knew that some ti me s he 
went to somebody but not night only during the 
day.  He had no permission so that his time 
working and doing this was not so easy for hi
m.  Anyhow, our relation was not so good as 
before. 

Q. You said that your brother worked in th
e underground, did you ever 
get into difficulties 
with that? 

A. I feel it. He never said this at home but 
there are too ma ny friends and they came to our 
room, with no loud speaking.  Even my mother, 
"What are you doing?   This
 is our business."  
SO, that I feel there was some thing there.  They
 had some  ne ws about the war, about the front, 
from where?  We had no radio.  I forgot to tell 
you that when we were 
living in this nice house 
we had very nice radio, Phillips Radio.  We  didn
't  even pay.  There was two years of payment 

and the Germans in the beginning 
immediately took this radio so 
that the Polish people never 
listened to no radio.  For my brother I had some
 news because from BBC they heard something. 
It was only my feeling, but I suppose he was afra
id that I was working 
in the theater with 
German people.  And then I said to him I have th
is friend, this soldier, 
I'm sure that he didn't 
want to tell me  about his underground work.

Q. Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie 
was Austrian, I mean he was part of the 
German ar my and the German ar my was responsib
le that you couldn't go to school, that you had 
to work. How did you feel about that? 
A. Usually my feeling to Ge rman soldiers was very bad because in the sc hool we were 

educated against Germany and Russia.  Even my
 mother sometimes when I wouldn't go to the 
church, she called me  a Bolshevik. 
 That was the worst thing.  Wh
en I met Willie and he said to 
me he is Austrian, my feeling was completely 
di fferent because I felt he's not German and his 
behavior was so good.  I thought ma ybe when I sa
id to my brother that he will understand me , 
but he didn't because he said for me  German unifo
rm is Ger man uniform.  It's Austria or it's not 
Austria but it is for me  German.  And he knew that I couldn't go to the school.  Very often he 

made me pla ns, you see the world, it will not be war time.  The war will fi nish.  Maybe you'll 

come to my country.  You will study there, you 
will be a real mensch.  Be a waiting person, do 
like just now.  Be in this way as
 you are because I was very honest.   
 In our family and my mother was very st
rong, strong for the education.  I never forget 
once before the war I went not to the school I we
nt -- instead to school with boys to some  play 
and because I was always going to the school, th
e teacher sent some body t o ask what ha ppened 
to me  why I didn't come  to the school.  My moth
e r  knew this.  I came home as usual.  It was 
greetings.  I said _____________.  My mother said 
I give you forever and I received -- I was 

punished so strong and she punished because who lie s also steals.  So, I was very honest so 

everythi ng what I've done was correct and therefore I believed Willie. 

 We talked about his future plans.  We  talked
 about is life and before for me  it was for me  
a pleasure to hear it.  I agree that
 I was very lucky especially as 
I told you during the war time .  It 
was so boring for young people.  I wa s 17 years old at
 this time .  I had no friends because I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
18 
 
to work mor ning from one work to another wo
rk.  I even had not enough for sleeping, only when 
I had no appointments with him I could sleep a little longer. 

Q. How old was Willie? 

A. He was ma ybe five or six years older than 
me , but he looks very handsome, very strong.  
I never seen his picture and he 
told me -- I asked once for his pi
cture but he said it's better you 
will not have it.  It will be very dangerous fo
r you and for me.  He told me also.  He said 

some thing, you must be very careful because Hitler
, what you receive for this kind of love is 

very dangerous.  You must be very careful.  
I said what for we are doing nothing.  Don't tell 
anybody that we meet or that we are comi ng here.  
It would be very dangerous.  He told me  one 

day he said "You know Hitler is also for me n.  He lik
es only this kind of love.  Really?  Yes, he's 
not ma rried.  He is single and he likes this 
kind of love.  The Fuhrer then why are you so 
anxious?   Please believe me , I a m olde
r I know better."  He told me  that. 
Q. Did he tell anything about the persecution of homosexual men? 
A. No, it was only the attention 
given to me  in this way, but 
it was in a real 1941 when we 
me t, let's go to a place here, I cannot tell you.  
He brought me  some thing new and he was very 
nervous.  What's happen?   At first I thought 
maybe someone has seen us. I asked him, no, 
nobody seen you know.  I'm sent to the eastern front of
 war.  Oh my to Russia. I heard that this 
was the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow.  You must wait for me .  I 
promise you.  The war will not be longer.  When the war is end the war you will come to Vienna.  

I will try to live with you together .  Wait for me
.  But how will I contact. I'll write you.  I gave 
him my address and I was waiting fo
r his letter but I hadn't received
 it.  I wa s very sorry, very 
sad.  Even my mother, my brother.  I said tomy  brother that my friend went -- he accepted, he  

agreed.  He was a little satisfied with this.  
He was more calmly that some thing happened wrong 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
19 
 
to me .  I wa s waiting for this letter.  Once I couldn'
t reme mb er -- I have to 
state to you also that 
in my theater there was working like me.  He was 
a little older.  He knew exactly, he learned me  
this way, he explained me this ki
nd of love and he asked me  -- firs
t I didn't want to tell him but I 
wanted to see the place, what's happened.  Wher e is this shed and then come  on let's go.  We 

shall go ma ybe there and once we went there it 
was after the performa nce and when we went 
there, voices.  Some  people -- I wanted to run 
away.  He too, and especially one fellow took us 
here very quickly, halted the mouths.  We  coul
dn't cry, nothing and then in broken German he 

said to me  that he's from the concentration cam
p Studthoff.  He was a very young Jew.  Bascal I 
reme mber this name .  We give our story to him to
 the other people.  We  talk to them also.  One 
spoke very good Polish.  He was Polish.  That 
Sigmund, the other boy took the Jew -- I couldn't 
take where we were living.  He took him home  
probably for some feeding even some dressing.  

What's happened there I don't know exactly.  I wa
s only with my things 
about my friend.  Even 
Sigmund if I  wanted to know, he 
told me only it was very nice time.  I can imagine. Maybe he 
used him for  some  sex or some thing like this because he said it was so nice. 

Q. How ma ny me n were in this shed? 

A. Three me n.  Some  of them they had stripe
s, some  trousers. Maybe they found them, but 
they had stripes.  They couldn't go on the stre
et.  They would be im
me dia t ely arrested.  
Everybody could recognize them.  They had this cap 
also with this thread. 
 Now I know that they 
had some _____ but I don't re me mbe r  exactly.  I 
knew only the faces very --- Bascal was small, 
but the eyes were very large,
 very big.  This is all. 
Q. Bascal, where did he come  from?    

A. He said to me  from France and he spoke -- 
I couldn't speak French.  He spoke only a little 
German, a few words.  Enough only to understand me .  Then when I was in the theater one day I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
20 
 
had seen a German ne wspaper and this German
 newspaper on the table and there was written, 
there was the address for the soldiers who are on th
e east front.  I wrote se
cretly this and then I 
was fighting with myself.  It was so long time, four months.  I haven't received a letter.  Have I to 
write or not to write the letter.

Q. When you went to this shed and you heard voices, what exactly happened? 

A. You see, when we went there there wa s 
change.  Usually I reme mber it that it was 
completely different.  We heard some  voices, so
me  huma n voices and when I said to my friend, 
Sigmund, let's go, we go, at this mo ment some
body stood up and closed our mouths, nothing to 
say.  Probably this ma n thought we are from Pola nd or
 ma ybe  some  spies.  Then he started to ask 
me  Polish.  He spoke very good Polish.  "What 
are you doing here? "  he asked me .  We  came 
only here because our paths crossed.  We  are not 
from -- no we are Polish.  He tested me  many 
times.  He fe els that I speak perfect Polish.  My
 friend also, and then we have seen two other 
faces.  They were layi ng the sheets and the 
youngest was trembling, was ve ry cold even the 
outside was not so cold.  And th
e youngest tried to speak some thing.  I asked in Polish first, but 
he couldn't reply me  Polish and he said to me  in German.  I asked "Are you German?   No, in a 

completely different way, in French. I'm French a
nd Jew."  He said Bascal's  his name .  My friend 
Sigmund took care of him i mme diatel
y.  I gave him shirt because he
 had only his striped jacket.  
This from the Studtkoff.  It is warm outside I 
can go home  in my white underwear shirt.  And so 

I did.  Then he said to this Basc
al that he will take 
him home  but only in this dressing.  Then to 
the two, he promised to wait here so long as 
they will come.  The French with the Bascal 

probably he wanted also to br
ing some  food, ma ybe some  dressing. I don't know exactly.  I had 
enough problems with my Willie and I couldn't help
 nothi ng more. I give only my shirt and that 
is all.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
22 
 
 Only the next day or after ma ybe two da
ys I asked Sigmund what happened.  He said 
everything is okay. Bascal was at hi
s house, slept there, and he didn't want me  to say more.  I can 
imagine he helped them.  He gave maybe food some
 dressing and they escaped from this place to 
ma ybe another place.  I never went more. I was al
so afraid that if I go 
there and there are some 
prisoners because they said they
 are from Studtkoff.  It was fo
r me  also very dangerous to go 
there.  So, that I didn't go anymore there. 
 Only this I knew from Si gmund can be sure
 everything is okay.  
You can be sure don't 
ask more.  I was wondering a little.  Usually he was a little crazy, not crazy, but so funny and at 

this mo me nt he was very, very serious and I proc
eeded very much.  Unfort unately he is also not 
alive.  I have me t hi m maybe even ten years ago when I was in Torran but no more.  He's  also 

dead.  He's no more alive.  If he were we could 
go -- I would like to ask him even for this address 
of my fr iend as I told you Titlebaum.  I tried to find his address.  I wrote to my fr iend to 

____________ in the South of Poland but for Sigmund 
I have no chance because he is no more 
alive.  I'm s ure that he helped for them ma ybe 
they are st ill alive, these three prisoners, maybe 
not.  Maybe when we ask some ti me s in the radi
o, who was hidden in the shed near Torran, 
maybe we'll find them. 

Q. Did you know then what Studtkoff was? 

A. Yes, I heard that it was the concentrati
on camp for Jews and Poles.  If something 
happened in Torran, they were se
nt immediately to Studtkoff.  I 
had -- there was very, very bad, 
very slow time.  Usually the family received the letter, this and this is dead, but we never 

believed.  It was not dea
d, probably shot more.  
Q. Were the Jews of Torran sent to St udtkoff?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
23 
 
A. No, I don't know.  Maybe not all.  In Torra
n there were not so ma ny, but near of Torran 
there was Alexandrov and there we
re ma ny Jews.  Even imme diatel
y in the beginning of the war 
when I didn't work by baker, it was not so fa r so I went by foot to Alexandrov to buy some  
bread.  I remember that the Jews had to wear th
eir David stars and they 
had to go on the street, 
and probably from Alexandrov th
ey were sent to Studtkoff. 
Q. And Polish people from Torran, do you know any Polish people? 

A. Who were sent?   No.  At the mo me nt I don't know.  I cannot reme mber. 

Q. But there was talk in Torran what happened in Studtkoff?  

A. Oh, yes, yes, you know among the people there 
was talking of course
 that the situation 
was very bad.  The food and the hell, --as all 
the concentration camps, 
but exactly as you know, 
ma ybe you r e me mber about my life, later then 
I was arrested and my knowledge about the 
situation of Polish people, Polis
h Jews  in Torran was broken. 

Q. Why were you arrested? 
A. As I told you when I found the address 
in the __________ in the German newspaper, I 
wrote secr etly the addr ess and then I was fi ghting 
with myself whether to write to Willie or not 
to write. 

Q. Which address did you find? 

A. I find it ___________________. It was for the soldiers
 who were sent to the eastern fr ont 
in Russia, ______________.  A very important address,
 probably for mos t  all soldiers in the 
front.  And I wrote a letter in my young German
 l a nguage.  Probably it was you see, my mi nd it 
is very di ffi cult to say the whole letter.  It was that  I love him.   I'm waiting for him.  I pray for 

him that he comes back and I never go to the sa
me places.  I didn't mention the shed.  I never go 
to the same place.  I wait, I hope you will come back
 as soon and I will be very grateful.  Please  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
24 
 
give me  some news because I am so anxious ab
out you.  I cannot sleep.  I cannot work and at the 
end, with may kisses your friend Teo.  I wrote. 
 And it was a little na ive to write especially 
I put my sender.  Usually I couldn't do that 
but I was fighting if I se nd without sender what
 will ha ppen.  Maybe the letter will not come  
back.  And if come  back I will know
 that he is not there.  So, 
I send the letter with my  sender. 
(section in bold has been copychecked; ge
t most updated version from Joan. 9/10/96) 
Q. And what happened then? 

A. After sending I was still waiting.  I wa
s waiting for a reply, but the reply didn't 

come, never.  Once it was September 19, 1942,I was working morning at this manufacture 

and the boss called me and told me that I'm 
invited to the gestapo.  I have to go to the 

gestapo.  I asked him, me to the gestapo?  What
 for?  I was so honest.  I do nothing, what 
for do I have to go.  He said please go there.
  We have received the or der that you will go 

there. 
 Usually I took a bag wi th some sand wi ch
es to the work.  My mother prepared me 
the sandwic hes and I left this bag wi th sandwiches
 at this manufactory but he said take this 
wi th you.  Maybe you don't come back.  Oh, why 
not?  If I come back I will have nothing.  
No, I didn't take, and when I we nt to the ge
stapo I remember this uniform, this black 
uniform wi th red here on the arm.  He asked 
me first for the name. 
 I told him that and 
then he took a typewr ite.  He started to wr ite.
  He wr ite I sitting also in front of hi m when 
the paper came down.  I read from other side 
and I never forget the words it wa s written 
"_______________" In English it is "Order for pris
oner."  The first moment I thought I 
wo uld fall down, and then he said you will stay no
w.  What for?  I began to cry.  Don't play 
_________. And then he called somebody.  They took
 me to the cell it wa
s down stairs in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
25 
 
cellar.  To the cell and there was the furnace wa
s only a wooden bed and a toilet and that's 
all.  Even the door was scraped wi th wooden 
s o I could put the handle like this.  And I had 
to wait.  The whole time I was sitting the nigh
t and I think what happened.  What for, and 
the next day when I was called again to him, he
 showed me the letter.  This letter which I 
wrote to Willie.  Is this your letter?  I was very honest.  I said of course.  This is my letter.  I 

wr ote this to him.  You, you wr ote this letter 
to a German.  You loved him.  I wr ote him it 
was very good, yes.  Then he said where did 
you meet him.  He wanted to know exactly 
where we  m e t at, what we  had done, in which way.  We se en only once or twice.  I lied, I 

tried to lie but you say me and he showed me 
some pictures, other pictures of soldiers, not 
only soldiers, civilians.  He wanted to kn
ow you cannot remember. You will reme mber.  
_______________ wi th trousers to beat especia
lly wi th the ____________.  It wa s terrible 
and I cried.  They put it in my trousers and th
ey beat me when I couldn't breath, I couldn't 
speak they brought wa ter and poured water 
on me and began once more again and again.  
All over, and always I heard only them, "You pig, you ______________" So many bad 

words I cannot translate it into
 English especially in Germ an. 

Q. Say it in German. 

A. In German ________________________________.  Terrible,
 so many words I hadn't 
ever heard before that.  And every day I was sent to the cell there was given only once a 

day, I don't know from there they brought.  At 
first in the beginning I didn't eat nothing.  I 
wa nted to drink only water.  Sleep I couldn'
t al so because I was so be aten swollen under 

my back -- when I was layi
ng only on my stomach. 
And so happened I don't know when, I lost
 even the dates, maybe about two we e k s, 
everyday the same question.  The last one they
 gave me something to 
sign.  I don't know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
26 
 
what.  I was  so tortured.  For me it was everything I signed only to be free.  
_______________, when you tell us the truth you'll be fr
ee.  I was so stupid.  I told them 
also about Hitler, what Willie sa
id, that Hitler is also homosexual.  He wr ote this.  Yes, and 
you the Fuhrer.  It was very, -- now I'm sm il
ing but it was not for smiling.  It was for 
crying.
 
 It happened so after two weeks as I told you I 
signed this what they wrote.  I don't know.  
Then they took me  by special closed car.  
It was a kind, we call this like a ___________, which 
means you don't see nothing there, like in pris
on.  When they brought me  I had seen the round 
prison.  I know because my brother immediately 
after the war, he was by the Germans also 
arrested by Germans but for very short time .  
Only reason was that he as a boy when he was 
going to the school -- it was not
 high school it was for the baker school, when he was going 
there, he has to train as a soldier, a Polish soldie
r.  For this reason he was in the same  prison.  I 
never forget how my mother suffered.  Some times  
she give me  bread to give him and then I had 
seen she cried and she said "Oh my dear God 
it's better you take him."  I had seen how the 

mother suffered if the son is arrested. Later wh
en I was arrested I thought
 also that ma ybe she 
suffered also.  He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but ma ybe 

we should go with my story further. 

 I was brought to this round pr
ison.  I was put in the cell with
 six or seven crime prisoners 
usually.  When they heard because each prisoner 
had received a special card.  I had received 
card.  It was written paragraph 175.  I didn't know 
what this mean paragraph and I showed it to 
everybody, but there was some body oh _______________it is for the gays, for the homosexuals.  

And since this time I was very bad behaved in this
 cell.  I was not human.  I couldn't sit at the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
27 
 
table when the meal began.  They trea ted me  very, very bad.  And I was sitting ther e until fi ft h of 
December 1942. 

 On the fifth of Dece mbe r  1942 some body opene
d the door.  The block meister took me  to 
the Judge.  I reme mber there was only my mother
, no people and me  and ma ybe five or six in 
black dresses.  They were the judges.  There was 
shouting and cried, I have to
 be isolated.  I have 
demoralized the German military, me Pollock and how could I do that.  I must be punished.  I 

must be punished for long time and I was 17 years old.  They punished me  for five years exactly 

___________.  I don't know exactly how it's called in German but _____________ is a very hard 

prison. 

 Immediately then I met my mother.  I c
ouldn't speak.  You can imagine how was the 
feeling my mother and me.  When I came to the cell first I cried.  But later I had to go -- I was 

sent to Koronovo.  was not far from ______________ 
ma ybe 50 or 60 kilome ters.  It was the 
worst prison in Poland before the war and during the war.  Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners. 
 I will never forget they cut my hair because 
in Torran I still had my own hair.  They gave 
me with some maybe yellow -- I 
don't know, it was here on the arm,
 and I was sent to the cellar 
with about 40 prisoners.  There 
were ma ybe about five 
or six Jews together with me  and it was 
terrible.  My me mories, especially in this cellar
 because the ol dest of this cell it was a prisoner 
for a long life, murder and there was a clan.  
Around him he had a few prisoners.  They ma de 
everything for him what he liked.  We  had nothing 
to say.  We had to be polite what he -- even 
with the toilet.  The to
ilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it 
was very small, but even if we receive d one s
poon of ma r malade, he took from us.  We were 
given a little ma rgarine, once or 
twice per week, he took also.  So, 
that this time this is my worst 
time in my life.  And then my leg began 
to be I have received a kind of ________________.  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
28 
 
cannot explain in English.  Due to the reason I ha
d no vitami ns.  It was like it was spoiled this 
leg.  It started from a s mall wound.  This was this
 leg.  From this to this here, this place.  
Nothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come  a 
little better.  Even there, there 
was so that because our work we 
were living, we were working in 
the same  cell.  There was very stupid work but ve
ry dangerous, very dusty.  We  had to the ropes, 
we could resolve the ropes then we had to ma ke 
the leather for the new shoes for the front they 
were sent.  This was the job and once they 
looked they wanted one ___________.  Oh, I have to 
explain also here that here we
 could write the letters once ever
y two or three months home  in 
German language.  Everybody doesn't  write Germa
n.  Me and especially my good friend, it was 

the Applebaum, exactly I reme mber, he wrote also 
German.  Some  of them gave us one potato or 
two potatoes for the writing.  At the first mo me nt
 I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes 
take it.  It is for them also very helpful when
 they have the contact with the parents or with 
fa mily your letters. 
 And so we cooperated very good in this wa
y and once happen that block me ister came to 
our cell and asked the oldest me n for  some body w
ho can write and speak German.  Fi rst he send 
some one from his clan but after a few mi nutes he
 came back and he said no.  Exactly he said 
_______________.  Then when he came one mo re, "You have nobody here?   Among 40 me n 
you have nobody.  I need a writer.  I was standing 
and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I 
think maybe I will be able for him.  I said "Her block meister, I can speak German and I write 

German too."  He was wondering I wa s so slim
 a nd young, where I could speak English.  And he 
took me  to his room.  He  gave me  pa per penc
il and dictated.  He di
ctated in German.  I 
reme mber it was an office, exactly 
as you like I can do this in German, 
__________________________.  He looked at this, yes, good.  
Go there.  Take your clothes and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
29 
 
you'll come  here.  I went to the cell and I reme mb
er everybody especially 
those of the clan but 
my friends, they said, really, he agree.  You are ab
le to take -- he takes you?   Oh that's  very good.  
Go boy, with his hand and with this 
you are also good that God helps you. 
 When I went there it was a three me n cell,
 much better, near the kitchen.  Some times 
when I had a little more -- I received someti me
s cigarettes.  Cigarettes we re very good like 
money for exchange.  Because I didn't  smoke -- 
I never smoked, I could make the exchange for 
the prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I receive
d some  bread.  Then I had the permi t  to go to 
other pl aces.  I belonged to the hi gh society of 
this prison.  I received be tter uniform, prison 
uniform, bet t er warmer.  Even the hair was a litt
le longer than usual.  As the flour some time one 
had no water and me  I was -- but I never forget 
about my friend Applebaum.  I went and took 
with me some bread some food and I went to th
e cell and I wanted to give him this.  Then I 
reme mber, I don't know exactly the name  of hi m,
 he said since few days there's no more 
Applebaum.   He patted -- he was in so high depr
ession.  He was ill.  He had diarrhea and it was 
very, very dangerous.  You know if some body ha
d this they couldn't stop and suffered.  I 
suppose he thought that this is the end and he ma de this. 
 Of course I left his bread there.  I came  
-- and that was not all because  every week from 
Koronovo where the transport statio
n to Sauxenhausen.  So always 
thinking about it was one day 
I will also be sent there.  Becau
se that  was the end of their life.  Who was sent to Sauxenhausen 
never returned. 

Q. Tell us a little bit more about --? 

A. He was older than me .  He was ma ybe fort
y, ma ybe, older than me .  He was black, black 
hair.  He spoke very good Polish.  He told me  that he lived in Lodz, this German city for 

_____________.  He had fa mily, but he never didn't  want
 to say me  what the reason was that he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
30 
 
was in Koronovo.  I thought ma ybe he was arre
sted before the war.  I don't  know, ma ybe 
political, I never knew.  Usually later you received
 a card what was the reason of the prison.  But 
this we haven't therefore I never 
knew.  I never heard about this.  His behavior, he said to me , 
boy don't be worried.  You are very young.  You w
ill succeed.  The war will be not long.  You 
can be sure.  He should be older because he told 
me  also about first war.  Maybe he knew this 
before.  He was so sure that -- because I lost 
my hope.  I thought ma ybe that Germany -- because 
always the Germans said Poland is forever forgo
tten, forever.  And I lost my hope, but he gave 
me  this trust in the pr ison. 
Q. Was he Jewish? 

A. Of course.  You see I have to state, ev
en in this prison, you knew immediately who was 
Polish who was Jewish.  The David's  star, they ha
d this, this Applebaum.  Therefore we knew, 
we Polish had only a number or ma ybe yellow on here, this stripe around. 

Q. What was this yellow me an? 
A. I don't know what this yellow means.  It
 was prisoners, not like pink or no -- the 
differences of color when I was sent as a writer
 I received green.  Before I don't know exactly the 
differences of color.   
Q. Did people in the prison know that you were sentenced because of 175? 

A. Yes, Applebaum kne w.  I told him, before 
I never hear this word homose xuality.  I told 
him only that I had some thing with a ma n.  I told 
him also with a German soldier.  He wasn't  
astonished, only he smile, oh you are a young boy.  It 
was stupid.  You are still healthy.  But my 
leg, you see, the war will not be so long. 
 He told me  always in this way. 
Q. Were there other prisoners who were 
imprisoned because they were homosexual? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
31 
 
A. You see there were of course ma ny, but some
 of them like the docto
r for instance.  He 
was working as a doctor because we had lazaret.  
It was for the very ill people, but there was no 
medicine, nothing.  But there were some.  When 
I was in the high position I met also another 
writer.  I met also someone from theater, not from
 Torran, from other places.  He was also for the 
homosexual.  Then because we receive, everybo
dy has a card and there was written for me for 
instance was written at this time not pa
ragraph 75, only ____________.  I don't know how to 
translate this into English.  I don't know.  It is li
ke because I have just now this year I received a 
document thanks to the red cross and I have even with me  this document and there was written 

_________________.  I looked at a dictionary.  It's  terr
ible.  It is in the Polish language, 
prostitution.  I was not prostitution.  St upid.  I 
cannot show this document to anybody.  It was 16 
or 17 years prostitution during the 
war, stupid.  I was so angry fo
r this document I couldn't sleep 
three da ys.  I wanted first to writ
e to ______________ because ____________ is a gay national 

in Berlin.  I wrote them.  I have also the 
copy and I explained them everything that this 
documentary is wrong.  Only one is exactly th
e date that I escaped from the prison in 
_____________ in the island.  It was the 15th of May 1945. 
 This is correct, but
 even there was a 
question nation, there was written unknown.  They 
arrested as a Polish.  They cried, "You Polish 
sow."  And then put "Nation, unknown."  I was so 
angry when I received this documentation.  If 
you wish I can show you later. 

Q. If you go back to the prison, did you have 
contact with other homo
sexual prisoners.  Did 
you talk about your situation? 

A. You mean in the prison?   No, becaus
e I had no experience.  This was ma ybe no 

homosexual.  I was also as we called this -- I 
didn't  know exa c tly.  Later after the war, I knew 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
32 
 
what it means, homosexual, gay etc. but me  I wa
s really very shy boy and I didn't know this.  I 
didn't talk about this and nobody asked, so that I ne
ver talked about homose
xuals in the prison.   
Q. Did you understand when during the interroga
tion, in the prison when the guard showed 
you the pictures of the other me n, did you understa
nd why -- what were you supposed to do with 
those pictures? 
A. You mean after the war? 

Q. No, you said in the beginning. 

A. In the begi nning when I met Willie -- . 

Q. No, no whe n you were arrested. 

A. I think ma ybe they wanted to know that I 
had ma ybe more soldiers, not only one.  This 
was the reason.  Before they showed me  some  so
l diers and civilians but I hadn't.  I had only 

Willie.  It wa s true, but they beat me .  They wanted to know and ma ybe they should kill me  

because they didn't believe me .  But  ma ybe afte
r two weeks they couldn't receive nothing more 
and they believed and I signed some thing.  What
, I don't know.  After the war, especially later 
when I was a tailor then I tried to fi nd the doc
uments so I wrote to Red Cr oss, everywhere.  I 
wanted to receive my documents.  See, ma ybe I will tell you some thing.  When I was a tailor and 

then when I was ill I didn't  receive any indemnif
ication for my time for prison.  Then I think I 
have to do some thing, I must wr
ite to anybody and to fight for my rights.  I spent as a boy for 
nothing so I suffered and my leg was -- my body was 
burned, and I want to call.  Fi rst I wrote to 
ask for the indemnification.  I explained that I 
was so long time the whol e time in the prison for 

this reason and I would like to
 receive some thing, some  comp en
sation especially because I had 
to go early as a tailor.  I couldn't work.  I wa
s ill for this reason and I had skin cancer and 
different illnesses, but I have re
ceived a reply very kindly that th
e money has been sent to Polish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
33 
 
governme nt.  I have to go to them and ask and th
ey have to give me .  But  it was the communist 
governme nt.  They will ne ver give  money.  Then 
I wrote once more that maybe some symbolic 
one ma rk only that I will have this satisfact
ion that he agree with
 me and I ask you for 
forgiveness.  No, I received letter
 if I try more to write all letters
 will go to the paperbasket.  I 
was so angry.  Then I write once mo re.  I will fight so long I will write to New York to the 
United Nations.  I will fi ght for my rights.  I 
bl ack ma iled a little because  I knew I coul dn't do 
that.  Then what I have to do, 
then I find an address in Germany in the parliame nt there was 
homosexual bond organization.  I wrot
e to them.  I explained that
 I was so young.  I suffered.  I 
have paid with my life.  My mother suffered a
nd my fa mily, and they explained we agree with 
you.  We  are very sorry, but really what we can
 do, we can only collect money for you for your 
research me dicine.  And I said no, I don't think 
you -- I don't need money.  I want to receive 
indemnification.  You must do some thing for me .   

 Then in Poland there was ma rtial law, you re
me mber and I said oh no, I cannot stay here.  
I must do some thing, and one day I received a 
very nice letter from Ger many.  A young writer 
wrote me a letter and he put this
 letter in a book about young Jews in 
Israel.  He wanted to give 
me  with this book a sample of his writing, how 
he  writes, hi s style of the book.  And it was 
written in this letter thathe found it by this organiza
tion a homosexual by Mr. _____________, 
he found my  story.  This story is very good for 
writing a book, and he asked me  whether I agree 
for this book.  If yes, he'll help me .  He put inside 20 ma rks for the stamps and this wa s the first 
money that I receive as indemnifica
tion from my stay in the prison. 

 Then when I wrote him I agree, I bought used
 old typewriter and ev
ery day because I was 
not working any more.  I was retired now accord
ing to my illness and I wr ote hi m every day 

about my be ginning from the prison everything that 
he needed for this book.  I sent to him, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
34 
 
sent me  again, so about six months we wrote. 
 He wanted some pictur
es. He  wanted to know 
some  details and when this project of this book wa
s finished he came to me , to Wa rs aw.  I gave 
him the signature and the book was printed in Ge rm
any.  The reaction of this book wa s fantastic.  
I never believed, especially the young people.  
They wrote letters and they asked me , ma ybe I 
need some thing.  They wanted to help me  and they were saying -- I suffered only the reason was 
I love somebody, that I loved a man.  It was very
 touching for me . Even until now I have contact 
with some  of them, espe cially one doctor who 
delivers me always there the medicine and they 
contact -- they visit me .  They 
come  to me .  I stay up to now 
with very good ma ny friends and 
the name  of this book is "Damned St rong L
ove" and in German _______________.  I paid really 
with my illness and with the me mories especi ally
.  When I was sitting in Torran and I had seen 
my mother was watching and I couldn't say to her it was some ti me s, it was -- for me it is very 

heavy to reme mber.  Some ti me s I say I can forgiv
e German, but never forget.  It is too difficult 
to forget.  And thanks also ma ny American so
ldiers because you see when I escaped in the 
British zone, I went to Munich because I though
t I will go to Vienna.  
I will find Willie.  I 
wanted to know what happened with him.  I wa
nted to meet him.  In the beginning it was too 
difficult.  My leg was worse and worse.  I rece
ived the displaced, the ca
rd, the displaced person 
card in Muni ch from the Americans and I was sent
 immediately to the American hospital.  I was 
about two or three weeks. I don'tknow exactly now, but I know that 
after three weeks I was fit.  I 

was so healthy and I was so ha
ppy that I was again alive.  
 Now, I want to go to Vienna.  In Vienna ther
e were Russians.  I couldn't I wanted to go to 
Poland.  I couldn't, because everywhere I heard 
that in Poland there are communists and their 
situation is not clear.  What I have to do is si
t and wait?   No, I started to work and I worked by 
Americans.  By Americans I learned a little Englis
h.  By Ame r ican I learne
d how is their life.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
35 
 
By American I learned how it is good because I was working in the canteen, I'm asking an 
officer.  I'll never forget the nice apples, red, 
the conflicts and even I reme mber some  words I 
learned, very funny like "hubba hubba" and it was real
ly -- I had some friends and I met also one 
officer.  He wanted to adopt me .  He wanted
 you must come  t o America.  I dreamed about 
America.  I wanted to come here to America 
but he said you must receive the permission from 
your parent s because they are alive.  I received 
once the letter from my mother and my father 

came back.  He was also in the forced labor ca
mp in Germany and especially my mother asked 
me  so much, come  boy, back.  Come  on, it is not very good but we will be  together.  And I was 

fighting with myself. I didn't know what have to
 do, to go or not to go.  Many friends said don't 
go, but my s oul says, "Better go" and I went of course. 

 When I returned I regretted it because it was everything strange.  Even when I went to 

this bath house where we were sent from 
Ger many I didn't recognize my young brother.  I 

reme mber he came and I said to my mother, "Mother a boy came."  She said, "This is your 
brother."  I cried but I couldn't go to
 Munich.  I had to stay in Poland. 
Q. Let's go back to the prison.  You told usyou were transferred to a small cell with three 
beds.  It was a better situation. 
 Did you stay in this prison? 
A. No, no.  Later, in the beginning I didn't 
know, but when the transport to Sauxenhausen 
the block me ister came also to me  and said you'll go to Stum.  You must go -- no he didn't sent 

me  to Stum only e took me  to sa me  transport.  Me
 and some  ma ny four or five prisoners.  They 
gave us you know how the hand -- and we went by 
and we went in special truck.  Then on the 

way I heard Stum.  Also, it is ________________.  In Stum, because my leg was so bad they 

sent me i mmediately to the lazaret.  In lazaret 
it was a little better because
 it was not necessary to 
work, but they couldn't heal my leg because th
ey had no me dicine and I was there ma ybe a few 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
36 
 
months, when the control always was there.  
Once he said, "Oh, you are too long.  It is not 
sanitary, you must go out."  I know why because the front of Russia was near and near and they 
wanted that we do some thing.  It
 was very hard work.  It was very wrong because once I was in a 

one man cell and we had always this
 card and it was written ___________________, what, I was 
with animals.  I was -- I never ha
d some  dogs or calves.  I went to
 the block me ister, excuse me  
please, it is written here, "Yeah su
re," he cried.  But no animals.  Please ride with me n but never 
with animals, and they put this 
animals away and only with me n. 
Q. Were you the only homosexual prisoner 
there or were there other prisoners? 
A. Only me .  Then I was sent to ____________ also
 there.  I haven't seen mo re homosexuals 
there.  There were some  me n who 
ha d stolen packages from t he fr
ont from soldiers.  When they 
killed the meat for the black market so completely different for everyt hing.  Some letters -- I 

don't know exactly the reason but ho
mosexual I haven't seen.  I reme mbe r  only it was in winter 
in January 1945 there wa s so _____________ because
 the Russian front was, it was 1945.  And 
we had to pack everything and about two week
s we went by food in the strong winter and you 
couldn't stop because you could fall and be fr
ozen.  It was very strong.  I reme mber the 
___________ was frozen.  We  crossed the 
____________ and the first maybe in ___________ 
received some  trucks or trains and from th
ere I wa s sent to the ___________ .  It was near 
Ha mberg. It was an island.  It 
was an island and I reme mber so 
ma ny bombs there but I pray that 
maybe the bombs will fall here, even in prison I 
could escape from prison.  But the bombs were 
to the city but never to the prison camp.  Then at
 the end of the war, it wa s the fifteenth of May, 
1945, I escaped from this prison.  I worked
 there as a pork, ________________.  It was a rather 
good job but I have taken with me  s o me times potatoes also, but thank God it was not so long 

time when we escaped.  I went immediately to
 the British soldier. It was exactly in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
37 
 
_____________.  I reme mber near Li nnenberg.  Then th
ey send me  to Birken Belsen but it was 
no more a concentration camp.  We we
re living together with Jews in 
this but not in the barracks.  
Only in the houses where the SS me n were livin
g.  There food was too good.  I was ill.  I was 
swollen and my leg was also very bad, so I th
ink no I have to escape here.  I must go to 
Americans.  There was no train and with some
 fr iends some  other boys we went by train to 
Munich, but it was no train, only American soldiers, some  transport.  And when I came to 
Munich there was the Judenrot.  They gave out
 a displaced card.  They sent me  to the 
_________.  It was for displaced pe rson.  I was living th
ere short time , but I wanted to be free so 
I me t a nice Polish gay boy who lived private and this boy, he 's still alive. He's living in Poland.  

He's older than me, but he's still alive.  He's ol
der than me . I met him very often. We  speak about 
our time because during this time I learned Engl
ish.  I bought a book for myself and he liked also 

the American soldiers.  Of course I me t also so
me  but I had no experience 
at this time.  Later, 
when I knew what homosexuality. 
 I learned later. The first time as I told you I was not so 
suffocated.  It was more roma ntic.  And so is my life.

 Can you tell us again, when you left th
e Koronovo prison and where did you go to? 
A. Yes.  As I told you a few prisoners were se
nt  to some places at the beginning we didn't  
know exactly where we are sending.  The firs
t mome nt I thought ma ybe we are sent to 
Sauxenhausen, but usually the transp
ort to Sauxenhausen were much
 bigger.  At this mome nt, a 
few only we nt.  Then we had seen some  other pr
isoners, a new one and we heard that it's Stum.  
Stum, special for young prisoners.  Young 25, 26, but 
not so ma ny older.  
And i mme diately after 
arriving there, they had seen that I couldn't wal
k.  They had seen my leg and they sent me  to 
Lazaret.  I wa s in the Lazaret with othe r prisone
rs, not homosexual there.  There was one from 
Kriena, there was fr om Belgium.  There was fr om
 Norway a nd German.  This Ukrainian, I was a 
little friend because it wa s very easy, Polish and Ukra
ine language is si milar so that we were like 
friends.  We  talk most than with other prison
ers, and after ma ybe two mo nths, because  every 
time ca me  control, especially one was ver
y, very bad, probably he
 was from Ha mberg, 
some body s a id to me .  I don't know exactly for everybody block me ister we gave a special 

nickname .  Let's say this horse Polish it was _________, it means horse head, because he's  

looking horselike.  He said, "Oh, you are still here?  
 You must go work.  He is not sanitary.  You 
will sin heathen."  What I had to do, I had to leave 
and I was sent to one cell, one pe rson cell.  As 

I told you ma ybe before with it's descri
ption on my door, ______________, with animals.  I 
asked him to change because you can ride with me
n I had only with me n some thing but not with 
animals.  It was not so easy.  It was 
_____________, everything is the same , especially during 

the war.  This is demoralization and it's just like 
animals.  I had to go to work.  It was very, very

hard, with other prisoners.  The nationality Itold you was mo st of them were Polish, some  
German, some  English, and also from Ukraine.  But Ukraine, I was wondering why from 

Ukraine, then after the war I can remember because
 Ukraine was treated a li
ttle better.  They had 
collaborated with Germa ny and ma ybe the prison
ers were better treate
d.  It was the reason. 
 Frankly speaking, ma ybe it was not so -- onl
y the work was very hard.  The food wa s 
ma ybe just a little better but not much better 
than in Koronovo.  Of course, there was not enough 

to be food, but better than in Koronovo.  I don't know why, but one time  they had to send me  to 

_______________.  Then I also feel what happened here
 was a big change.  Then somebody said 

to me that my mother applied -- I don't know th
is is kind of a group for German cities and like 
that.  She wa nted to he lp me .  Then after the wa
r my sister she told me  she wanted to take the 
lawyers advocate.  She had done everything to rel
ease me  from this, and this was the reason that 

I was sent from Koronova to the St rum generally 
for the young prisoners.  Not so the crimes like 
in Koronovo, there was completely different. 
Q. Which kind of release --? 
A. This is like German release, this belongs 
ma ybe for better treating.  
It was a kind of -- it 
was exactly a group __________________________, I don't know.  
I had never seen this.  I had 
only after my release the my mother applied for th
is. Maybe it was the preparation that after the 
war we would be the German citizens.  Ma
ybe, I'm not sure, but probably it was this.  
Imme diately the change was but
 before there was no change. 
Q. All other prisoners in Stum were in this program? 

A. Maybe also.  I have never seen this docu
me nts with this third group of German list.  
Probably it happened the same .  I think so, beca
use when we escaped from this, there were only 
three Polish boys.  One was from __
____________, one was from _____________.  I think so,

therefore, when I wrote the book, I asked th
e writer _____________ to find old documents.  First 
I wanted to fi nd my full documentation.  I wanted to have the same  _____________ that's 
happened in east Germany.  He has done everythi
ng, he couldn't .  What I received, I received 
only an option of one part of these docume nts whic
h was as I told you, -- but
 it is not exactly the 
same . 

Q. In Stum _________________________? 

A. No, I was brought there.  I didn't know nothi
ng.  If some body said to me  they had to say 
to me, "Your mother applied to this German lis
t.  You are now Ger man."  No, it couldn't  be 
because I should be sent  to the military.  It's 
happened.  I have seen some times, you know, they 
took them but from whe r e I don't know.  Maybe to ___________ when they needed soldiers. 

 Ones that go free to the ____________ they will
 go free but it was very dangerous and 
nobody returned back.  But I didn't never.  First I 
knew about this when I returned after two years 
after the war to Poland.  My mother "Yes, I tr
ied to do my be st but you didn't --"  She thought 
that I would be free immediatel
y and even in these documents I received there was a mention 
that I had to be in the pr ison exactly five years. 
 It was fifth of December, exactly five ye ars.   
Q. What kind of work did you have to do in Strum?

was some  ki nd of beating for this you could -- 
I don't know ma ybe he thought he didn't  see it, 
because he was very, very --.  At the end when 
they feel that the Russian front is comi ng they 
changed a little bit.  We  had days where we wa

A. Around the -- it was in _____________ because in _________ were barracks.  The

no place and it was kind of a _____________ before.  And they ma ke this for the security, for

Q. Were they wooden barracks or stone barracks?

The baker house is standing, the prison isthere, the documentation from t he foundation 

_____________ when he go there I will show them.  
They will make a documentation because 
me , I 'm 71, ma ybe tomo rrow or after tomorrow I'll 
die and there will be no document a tion.  It 
must be for the young people. 

I can forgive but not forget, especially for th
e young.  They must know how it was difficult in the 
war and what for, for what reason.  Only for the 
fact that I like men. From
 the beginning, I'm not 
the child of God.  I was born, -- I didn't  know when
 things happened.  Maybe just the first time  
when ___________---, but it was pl aying.  I didn't know.  First, even as I told you it wa s not so 
suffocated, it was _________ in very childish wa
y, a rather roma ntic way.  Now, I know 
everything.  I am old and I read book.  Of course
 it should be like I had 
no advantages.  Not only 
advantages, I even had three time s fr iends because 
I like not to jump from one flower to another 
one.  I had good friends.  Even just know in Pola
nd, but he's ma rried and this is more difficult. 
Q. It must have been also ve ry difficult 
for you to go through all these years because you 
were very young.  How did you ma nage.  Where 
did you get the strength
 to get through it? 
A. (Answers in German.)  I lost my hope that 
I will stay alive.  A
nd especially in Koronovo, 
I had to be also absent in the 
bed or I felt that I forget to sa
y how ma ny insects there were.  I 
don't know exactly the name s of these, even the 
lice, but you know, it's terrible.  I prayed and I 
was so -- it was for me  some times 
if I should be dead.  Some times I wished to be dead.  You see, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
45 
 
then in Stum, and this again, I wanted to stay to
 alive and I feel that even in Stum, one  day came 
very good infor mation that in Wa rsaw, 
______________ this uprising, it was in August -- I'll 
never forget, it was August 1944, came informa

A. Of course I can.  The barracks were let'
s say ma ybe 20 for each -- in each barracks were 
living in two divided bigger room
s, 40 or 30 prisoners.  There were also one barrack for the 
kitchen, one barrack is for the ma gazine.  One 
was for the tailor and for workers like wooden 

work.  What's more there, maybe -- and around th
e barracks as I told you
 was some  of that 
sound, the electrician wire.  They said I don't 
know, I'm not sure but they blackma iled us, if 
some body tried they will pay with 
their life.   Each corner was 
a tower, a watch towe r.  He 
was with a gun and that was -- and we had each day for half an hour we have to walk because 
you need fresh air and during the walking I me t this ______ who told me  I'll follow you.  It was 
this and -- 

Q. When did you have to get up? 

A. It was morning, very early.  It was about six 
o'clock.  First we have to bring this way, and 
to wash there was everything, washing in cold wa
ter of course.  And not in the same  barrack 
where you were sleeping privat
ely.  There was a barrack for washing.  And you came  to your 
barrack and the _______ brought you some  kind of 
soup.  It was soup like water and a piece of 
bread.  Everybody -- for me  ca me  the  block me ister.

the ma gazine ma ke the or

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

 After that afternoon, they came again.  We 
stood there in this barrack.  There was no 
central heating.  We  had only through -- they ga
ve us wood, but it was warm rather, so long as 
you put the wood.  It was warm.  Some ti me s th
e guard would bring some  kind of tea that 
some body put in the water.  Some  they drank, bu
t only prisoners who had 
a special contact with 
some body.  I had no contact so I couldn't do nothing. 
 I was living, as I told you, with Hendrick.  
He was upstairs.  He was working for the tailor. 
Q. Did your mo ther know where you were? 

A. At this mo ment, she knew.  She had received information that I'm -- but I never saw her.  

It was not allowed to visit to come , no, but sh

me and wrote to my mot her that I am 
alive, but she told me  later, when we talke
d, after my return from 
Ger many, she said some body

her hope was a little better.  First when I wrote 
the fi rst letter after the war, she was co mpletely sure that  I was alive. 
Q. You were not allowed to write lett
ers during the time you 
we re in prison? 
A. Yes.  In ___________,I don't know.  I'm not ex

only letters, you understand, but at the end of the wa
r when we left this, she -- she didn't receive 
any informa tion from __________.  Only the last, ma
ybe from Stum or ma ybe I don't  know.  It 
was too long time ago. 

Q. Did you receive letters fr om her? 

A. If I had I would like to have the documentati

me  relation with some  other prisoners who 
worked in cafeteria, and they ma ke very ni ce friends.  I send this ____________ so some  of 

prisoners they were sent to ma ke the job outside

with bread and they sent  to my mother and this 
friend I have -- and I put 
a pictur e of my mother 
there and from foundation he was before he cam
e here he was home he made a picture. 
Q. So you must have felt very isolated in th
ese years not knowing how your fa mily was, if 
they were alive? 
A. Listen, youknow, my father 
was not home and I loved my 
mother over everything, and I 
couldn't help.  I had seen how she suffered wh
e n my brother was only one month.  She had 
suffered so much, I have seen this.  She crie
d, "Why you give me  this?"  You must understand 
that this painful on mother.  She was so happy when
 I returned.  Therefore, I tried to go as soon 

as it was possible and I am correct, so about -- 
I was together.  I was 
living in Wa rsaw.  All 
holidays, Christma s I spent with her and I help so 
that in this way I'm correct and satisfied.  She 
suffered.  She spent you know so she has -- I wa
s the youngest, but then there came another one 
which she loved very mu ch.  Even after the war when we talked some ti me s, she told me  that a 

neighbor, she was some t hing talking, and they 
asked "What is the reason you?"  She said, "I 
don't know."   But probably I thing so that the 
gay, Sigmund, ma ybe he said some thing.  What 
happened with him, I don't know.  M a ybe he said
 some thing.  Afterwards everybody knew.  But 
my mother, she was very simple.  She finished only 
four classes, but she neve
r said to me "It's all 
my fault, or this is the reason."  She 
had to suffer.  No, she never said this. 
Q. Can you tell us when in ___________, when the Russian army approached, what 

happened?

48 
 
couldn't recognize.  I didn't re me mb er exactly.  Th
en we had to go.  They shouted always, "Don't 
stop.  If you stop, you'll see you'll die."  Because it 
was twenty degrees be low zero.  It wa s very 
cold.  I was very tired.  I wanted to stop I'm sure
.  If I would fall, I could die imme diately.  You 
were frozen.   You were tired.  You better go, go, 
go.  And always they shouted don't escape.  If 
you escape, you'll pay.  We 'll shoot.  Then because we
 had to count always.  Always, lists, lists, 
lists.

very good.  And it was 28th of February, rather 
a little warme r  but not so warmer, and they 
picked up this and they ate it so I remember. 

 After a few days they needed some  pigs.  Th
ey were not for us, only for the staff for the 
block me ister.  And they needed somebody.  I wonder,
 I never worked before in this wa y.  It was 
very difficult because  you had to ma ke clean alwa ys
.  The pig were --, you have to do this.  But I 
was satisfied because I share with the pig some
 how you call it -- this is

that there is a special, it was a ki

left this cart and I joined them.  They knew proba

instea d to work the soldiers they ma ybe will work in the garden everythi ng.  They do nothing so

 I'll never forget it was in Hanover, I thinkso, and there was black American and I told 

him that I only German.  He allowed us to come
 in.  He came some  things of food and soon by 

this truck, this train, we went to Muni ch becau

Then I worked there until the end of my stay.  
When I wanted to go to Poland the American said 
"Stay better here."  And I receiv
ed very nice recommendation.  I 
have it in English here.  He 
wrote, "Any recommendation will be __________.  
He worked and he's  going at his own 

request." 

Q. The first time when you me t this British sold
iers and afterwards, did any of them ask you 
why you exactly were in prison? 

A. No. 

Q. Did you tell anyone? 

A. The Americans, no. 

Q. Whynot? 

A. You see, first of all, as I told you, this 
is -- I didn't know this word.  I said what for 
because I loved a Germa n soldier.  Stupid reason.
  Nobody could believe me .  Now, if I was to 
answer, "I was a homose xual."  But at this time I 
was some times I thought in my head, what for?   
I didn't kill anyone.  I was in very good friendship 
with some  of the soldie
rs, this is the reason I 
have to go to prison?   When they asked me  -- th
ey didn't ask me .  I told all of them I was in 
prison.  There was nothing given to this question.
  This was nothing.  A displaced pe rson.  They 
found me  my country is Poland and I am in Ger ma
ny.  The war is to end and I am in Germany. 
Q. Do you know what happened to Willie? 

A. This is so complicated.  Me, together 
with Lutz Va nDyke, we tried to research 
everywhere.  In Poland, in Germany, in Austria,
 and with no news, nothing.  But you see, I have 
also this document.  I received, it's stupid.  Th
e same  na me  a nd everything is okay, even the age 
should be maybe the same , Willie Goetz.  Only th
e question is he was born not in Austria, in 
Germany.  It was written in German and what's more
 it is written that he is dead at the beginning 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

-- I was arrested in '42, and he's dead in '43. 
 During the war -- I'm not sure.  I have this 
document.  Thanks to VanDyke.  I have to stat
e he helped me  a lot.  Through him I received 
even the document that I was in the pr ison fr om th
is and this time .  When I went to no security, 
for insurance, for this time  for the three years, 
-- longer because they give a better date, but for 
three years they came to the tailor and I have just a little more, but fi rst when I went for this 
document.  It should be translate
d, but this translator who writes 
for this translation, and for me  
they said, "You received this from Germany?   
This exception, they neve r send this."   Yes, 
through a very good friend, I said.   

 Many things, he has done for me  a lot.  I am
 with him in very good friendship.  He visited 
me .  I 'm staying always in contac
t.  You must know I was very i
ll.  One month ago I wanted to 
cancel my trip to America and he called me  always.  He wanted to send me  money because I had 

kidney stones.  Our health service is very bad.  
They sent me  to the hospital and I knew in the 
hospital very bad service.  They should cut me  i
mmediately and I didn't want, so I have a little 
money for this addition and from this money I ma
ke everything private.  
The special laser and it 
was private.  I paid a lot of 
money for it because I suffered for four weeks.   Then I thought I 
could do this.  Even before I came  here, firstfrom the foundation, one of the gentlemen came to 

me .  He wanted to ma ke the picture.  He ma
de this frame of my mother.  He made some 
documents for the documentary.  He brought me  from ___________ one letter from young boy.  

I never seen him, a very nice wri
tten letter.  He wr ote me, "Dear Mr
. Stefan, I'm astonished that -
--"  I regret that I didn't bring th
is letter here --"I'm astonished that you never hated us.  You have 
suffered so much.  I read your book.  I found your 
story very good but very touching.  I want to 
help you if you need help then please ..." 

Q. Did you have difficulty later on from 
the years you were in prison physically? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
54 
 
A. Of course, ma ny.  Live r and heart.  With liv
er always.  I'm ta king me dicine every day.  
But thanks in Ha mberg he sent me  always.  Th
is me dicine I couldn't buy and not to pay because 
in Poland it would be too low, it would be not e
nough.  Like he had private.  You know I paid for 
this the last time  I was ill about ten million lo
tas.  It is in dollars
 about $1,000 I had to pay 
everything private.  He called me  always, take pr
ivate.  Do this.  If you need more I'll send you.  
The last time he sent me a very nice letter a
nd said you are going here and I am to Moscow 
because he works in the Ann Frank Foundation.  
He knows me  well.  He know how I suffered.  
We worked together on this book so that we are 
like brothers.  He knows my sorrows also and 
we plan in the springtime I would like to ma ke a 
report of my  visit here 
in the United States of 
America.

Q.  How did you feel about what happened? 

A. Sometimes I'm wondering that I'm still a
live.  That I succeed and some ti mes I'm 

wondering what kind of reason that
 the people that do are ever ab
le to torture the young people 
like me .  I am catholic, I forgive but forget I canno
t.  I cannot.  Some times
 there are very heavy 
scars even now.  On Sunday I was invited to Amer
ican friends.  They never spoke.  I have to tell 
them and in some  places my voice was broke becau
se it is everything fresh.  Even during the 
writing of this book and when I read this 
book I cried because I have everything _______ 
especially twice.  When I see my mother alwa
ys standing watching the pr
ison.  She didn't see me  
but she came.  She wanted to see me .  I saw her, but
 she couldn't.  Then the judge, it was terrible.   
 But, with my soul I'm correct  that  I return
 back.  I could be here
.  Maybe I could have 
here very good possibility for everything and ma
ybe I would even be millionaire but I spend my 
time with my parents and especia
lly with my mother.  She suffered so mu ch, and the only thing 
even the education from the child she learned 
me  how I have to be good and honest to other 

people.  If some body did wrong I think then sh
e said don't you think and always my teacher 
when I was going to the school after the war, I ha
ve to finish my exa mination once it was written 
what I could do if I could.  And I was written agai
nst all enemies.  I'll never forget this teacher  
she wrote, "The word is very good, but don't forget 
enemy is destruction."  And I know this is for 
-- it is very good that the young German people they
 cannot take the respons
ibilities for the old, 
for the Nazis but they are so good and I'm so to
uched when I receive so ma ny letters and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
56 
 
critique was so good.  In all German languages, th
e reception of this book was fantastic.  I'm sure 
it will be the same  here. 
 As you know, yesterday, when we had this sm
all journal interview, ma ny ladies, they 
came to me .  They gave me  business cards.  They wa
nt to stay in contact.  They want also to 
print in the gay news, they want 
to show the world that the wa r and the stupid rules of the war in 
Nazi time must be over, never again.  Never. 

Q. When you were in Poland you di
dn't talk about y
our experiences? 
A. I couldn't.  During this I couldn't, I had to 
lie.  I said always I was in the prison and you 
know the reason I give _______________________.  Because if
 I did, I couldn't find job.  It was 
for gays, it was very bad time.  I suppose th
ey knew some thing, there is some thing wrong 
because even I finish my studies but I couldn't receive very good position.  First of all, I was 

always single.  This is no good.  Second, I was so long time in _______________ until 1947.  

Usually everybody returned and me  not.  I know that
 some time s even in some  works where I was 
working especially they collabo
rate with the communists by dri
nking vodka they said you are so 
clever and you are so good, but you have some thing.  You cannot advance.  I knew the reason 

was ma ybe this, that I wa s a gay, a 
homosexual.  That was the reason. 
Q. Did you meet anyone later --? 

A. Yes, I me t in Torran.  I was also in Koronovo 
but that even the last time  I was in Torran 
with some of them was working in
 the war house and my br other went to him.  He gave us a very 
bad time because he had some  better quality goods or like that.  I have seen him.  I have met 

three.  One was the doctor, he was living in Wa rs
aw but he's now dead.  About three, I me t, gay, 
from Koronovo. 

Q. Did they say the same  thing about what it's like to be gay me n? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
57 
 
A. There were more, but after the war 
I me t the m in Torran and one in ____________. 
Q. So there were a lot of gay me n in prison in Koronovo? 
A. Not so ma ny, but there -- especially fr om 
Torran.  As some body told me  there were about 

80 to 100 people arrested for homos e xuality in Torran.  I di dn't  know that in small place so ma ny 

but he told me  so. 

Q. Who told you? 

A. The doctor.  He knew, I know  his name  but it's not necessary.  I know his first name  

because he was also in Warsaw and I met hi m very
 often and he told me .  He had the possibility 
to see the docume nts because he was working ther
e as a doctor  together with the German block 
me ister but he finished before the wa r.  He wa
s educated as a doctor.  He  could work there. 
Q. Did you ever talk to the fa mily about the years? 

A. Never, and they gave me  never chance to 
speak about it and to feel it.  I'm sure they 
knew, my brother, but only you see one sist
er she said to me , _____________ he's  probably like 
you because he's ma rried and he has no children and I'
m sure that he's also that.  I'm s ure maybe 
he was also gay but it was little
 discovered because my sister said
 everything he had he wrote in 
the last will to one young boy, that
 was in village and his wife once told me  also whe n I me t her 
in Torran that she coul d receive a divorcement 
when she go to the church because she doesn't  
sleep together with people li
ke this.  So ma ybe it was the same in family.  I think so. 
Q. Did you talk with your parents or brothe
r about what you went 
through in the prison? 
A. No, no, we like it this subject -- even when
 we went to ot her fa milies, oh you spent some 
time in prison what was the reason and I said, don't
 talk about it, this was a very bad time, don't  
mention it. 

Q. Did you tell your mother about
 the conditions in the prison? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355  
58 
 
A. Oh no, I couldn't to ma ke her -- no, no, never. 
 I tried to do my best.  Even when I was a 
student and came to my mother 
she went to bake and brought me
 some  bread.  She showed me  
that she loved me.  This subject was omitted.  
 (Looking at pictures)  That's me .  I think I wa
s ten years old and it was in Torran.  This is 
the ma in street opposite of the munic i pa
l house.  This is the ________________ Monume nt. 
 That was my last holiday in Torran n
ear _____________.  I was with Polish friends and I 
bake a cod fish which I succeed without a card, free 
of ration.  I was here about sixteen years old.  
It was my last holiday. 

 It's me  when I was working in theater as a 
gypsy in operetta.  That was before when I was 
sitting and this ma de a picture.  It
 was not on the stage it was in the ______________. 
 This is very important documents.  This is
 my displaced card which I received from 
American in Munich.  The both sides, the first one 
and the other side it's very important.  It has 
everythi ng written that I am a displaced person. 
 It is written in English so
 that everybody knows that this 
is a displaced person's card and 
it's use. 
 That's me .  I was here about 23, 22, no 
21, ma ybe 21 or 22 when I was working for 
American as a waiter in Dachau.  There is descri
ption "Kitchen number s o and so."  It was in 
Dachau as a waiter. 

 That was in Munich when I was working as 
kitchen help together with a Polish guard.  
They are working as a guard for American sold
iers. He was Polish but in American uniform.  
 This is in Munich.  I was here probably 
21.  Behind me  is this 
house where I was living 
there.  You see how the house it's windows were without glasses.  So looked Munich after the 

war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0355

 This is the documents when I was working for the American military as kitchen help as a 
waiter. 

 This is also one docume nt more dur
ing my work by American in Munich. 
 This is my certificate of my working as a 
waiter in Munich or Dachau as a waiter for 
American soldiers.  And there 
is a translation into German 
the same. It was my last job. 
 This is very important documents.  It is th
e part of my documents in all the prison.  I 

received these documents after researching five 
or more years and there 
is everything written.  
Only some t hing is very, very stupid because
 it is me ntioned "Nation unknown."  How it is 

possible to write "Nation 
unknown."  I was arrested as a Pole.  
I was beaten as a Pole and they 
me ntion unknown.  It is a stupid pa rt of the documen
t but I couldn't correct it because I was glad 
to receive this very important doc
ument.  This is the proof that 
I was in the prison so long time.  
It is there written.  Everybody can 
see here that I was punished for 
five years of prison and that 
was so long that I have to be in the pr ison 
until December 1947.  It means that longer than the 
war, but thank God I escaped and I was free earlier.
