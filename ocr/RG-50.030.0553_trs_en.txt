Q: Did you attended a school at the time? 
A: No, I never went. I-I was supposed to 
Œ I remember that I was supposed to go 
that year to school when the Germans came 
in. So I never actually went to school. 
Q: Were your other sisters on Œ 

A: The older sister mu st have gone 
to school, but I really don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But I™m sure she did, because she wa s much older. Like, I was closer to the 
younger one, you know, and th ere was prob
ably quite a few difference between the 
older and my self and my  younger sister. 
Q: And how Œ how ma
ny years are there in betwee
n your sisters and you? 
A: I Œ I don™t know, you know, I™m just so
rt of imagining that sh Œ th e older one 
must have been like at leas
t three years older, because 
I rememb er her Œ you know, 
being that I was little, I thought she was bi
g. But the truth is, I don™t know. And the 
younger sister was wa Œ not too Œ 
too much younger than I was.  
Q: Okay , so wh -what do you rememb er about the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: About the home life I don™t rememb er to
o mu ch. We lived in a very beautiful 
street by the name of 
Panienska
. And I know that the fi Œ people who know 
anything about 
Dubno
, and if you tell them
 Panienska
 street, they know that that 
was a very beautiful street. My parents ha
d like a little Œ I would say they called it a

kiosk, like they was having 
candy and things like that. So my  parents were hardly  at 
home. But th ey had one of Œ a Œ a Œ a Chri
stian, actually a Uk
rainian woman by the 
name of
 Lerna
(ph), and she was raising us. Sh e wa
s really more like my mother Œ 
like a mother to me th an my
 own mo ther, because she was always with the girls, my  
mo ther was busy in the store. So, I loved 
her very mu ch , and she loved the ch ildren. 
She was very devoted  person to  us. And in  
fact, she was the one that saved me, at 
the end. So, too mu ch ab out the life befo
re that, I don™t rememb er too mu ch. But I 
do remember when the Germans came in, a
nd I™ll never forget one of my cousins 
came and they said, you know, you have to
 leave your home, and we have to all 
move to a ghetto, which was a 
Dubno
 ghetto. And then wi Œ all of Œ the whole 
family, like my mo Œ I remember my gr
andmother was there and my  father™s 
brother also lived th ere, and they  had ma
ny children, like at least fo ur or five 
children. But I don™t remember, y ou know, 
their ages or their names, I hardly 
remember that. 
Q: So they were all 
gather at the ghetto. 
A: And Œ and th ey Œ we were 
all in the ghetto, and la Œ 
Q: Okay. Ah Œ hah Œ sorry, just

Q: How did you know that Œ I me an, you we
re seven years old,
 how did you know 
that this was the Germans? Did you also
 see local people involved in  gatherin g 
Jewish people and taking th em to the ghetto?  
A: Well, to tell you the truth, I didn™t 
see Germans until I was in the ghetto, and 
then I did see Germans. They
 used to come every once in
 awhile, they would say Œ 
you know, they used  to call it an 
obla va
(ph), which means like Œ you know, they 
would decide that they woul
d Œ gonna come into the ghe
tto, and let™s say, whoever 
was outside, they would kill. 
And I do remember seeing them. 
Q: Did you recognize them in their uniforms? 
A: Uniforms, yes. 
Q: Okay. Were they a different 
color than  other people? Was Œ 
A: Well, it was the German uniforms Œ 
Q: It was German. 

A: I remember their hats, it wa
s like a greenish uniform. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And, you know, people would alert us, 
so, the Germans are co
mi ng, so we used 
to hide. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Yeah.

Q: So, th e ghetto, how many people of your
 family do you Œ do you recall mo re or 
less? I mean, a Œ yo-you ju st mentioned 
th at you met there your aunts and Œ 
A: Yes, yes, there was Œ 
Q: Œ cousins. 
A: Œ well, I Œ as I said, I don™t Œ I know he
 had a wife, and I know we had cousins, I 
don™t rememb er how many and how old th ey 
were. But, you know
, I know we lived 
in the si Œ all th Œ all in the same h ouse,
 you know, in Œ in th
e ghetto. And in the 
ghetto, I don™t know, I remember playing 
like outside a little bit with, you know, 
other kids. And Œ and th en I also rememb er
 that m-my uncle and my father, they 

made like a hiding place. They called it a 
schr on
, which means like 
an  un d e rg ro und  
bunker, I would say a bunker. And wh enev er
 there was rumors that the Germans are 
coming, or that the end was gonna come or wh
atever, we used to hide in that place. 
And once it was over, everybody came
 out. So I do remember that. 
Q: And was it only your sisters and you th at
 hid there, or was also the other Œ 
A: No, e-everybody. 

Q: Œ cousins, and Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay , okay. 
A: Everybody.

Q: Okay, so others as well? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. So, what ha
ppened afterwards? 
A: What happened afterwards, of course 
you know the life in the ghetto was a Œ 
pretty miserable. I remember even I Œ I 
Œ I™ll never forg et that one day we were 
outside and the Germans came, an d I rememb
er they took like a 
little kid, and they 
threw them in the barrel of water, like 
rainwater, you know, the barrels used to 
collect rainwater? And that image stay
ed with me for a lo ng time. But what 
happened is, towards the end, 
I remembered also again, people came Œ well, first of 
all, you know my  father 
was in touch with le -- 
Lerna
(ph), that™s the nanny that I 
was telling you about. And what happene
d was, the ghetto was built by Jews, and 
they were built by planks, yo
u know, there were planks
? And they like left one 
plank open, and she used to come and ge 
Œ bring us food. And one time she actually 

came and said that she wanted to  take me, and you know, to save me, and Œ and Œ 
and so on. And she did take me out of
 the ghetto, I don™t reme mb er how, but I 
remember that my father was 
like crying when I left. And 
in the middle of th e night, 
she took me to her place where she liv
ed, not too far aw
ay from the ghetto. 
Q: Do you know why Œ why y
ou, and maybe not your young
er sister, or your other 
sister, yeah.

A: I don™t know. I always wondered. I al
ways wondered. That™s something that I 
always, always have in mind, why me, you know? Bu t I think that wh at happened, 
that it was circumstan ces, because we Œ ye
ah , I don™t Œ I don™t know really why. 
But the first time that she took
 me out, in th e middle of the night, I sort of got Œ got 
scared, you know, that I™m away from my 
parents, so I came back by myself, I 
don™t know how. 

Q: How old were you still? 
A: I™m maybe seven years old. 
Q: Seven, okay. 

A: And I came back and I still remember that
 at the ghetto gate, they used to have 
Jewish, I don™t know, I want to call them 
policemen, but guard s, let™s say guards. 
And I still remember that one of them sa
id, look at her, she™s coming from the 
outside and she didn™t bring anything. Ca
use all I did was, you know, just come 
home. And this 
Lerna
(ph), who was the one that, you know, I was with, woke up in  
the mo rning and I was gone, and she was like really panicky. So  she came  to the 

ghetto and she said to my  father, I don™
t know wh at happened , I don™t have the 
child. And he said, don™t worry, she™s here. So
 that™s Œ I remained 
in the ghetto with 
my family, until the very en
d when they announced an 
akcja
 Œ an 
akcja 
mean  Œ  
meant that they were 
liquidating the ghetto.

Q: This was in Œ was it years later, or Œ 
A: Well, we were occupied in ™41, and th is mu st have been, I don™t know. To Œ to 

tell you the truth, I don™t know exactly 
whether it was a year or two later. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Whatever the ghetto, you know, that 
probably  could be documented. Bu t I do 

remember that somebody came tomy father and said, listen, 
Lerna
(ph) is at the 
gate, you know, because we were all 
gated in. It™s not like today™s gated 
communities, yeah. And they 
said, you know, if you have a Œ a child, just, you 
know, throw her out, like bring her out. So
 I remembered like 
they picked me up 
physically and brought me to the gate. 
By that time the Germans were already Œ 
they were on their way to come to liqui
date the ghetto. And sh e was waiting for me, 
she took me by the hand like th is, and we st
arted walking, just walking. And I Œ I 
don™t know, I was just very pliable, I guess,
 and this time I just went with her. And 
in fact, on the way Œ on the way, as we
 were walking, we were caught by th e 
Ukrainian police, and we were taken into
 a pla Œ a room, and I rememb er sitting 
with her, just like today, like she was s
itting and I was sitting. And the policeman 
was called away for some reason. There 
was a woman scrubbing the floor and she 
said, what are you sitting here? Go. He™s not 
here, get out of here. And so  she took 
me again by the hand and she Œ we walked  
out of there, which was again a miracle,

I guess in Jewish you would say
 bashert
. And we just walked an d walked and 
walked until we hitchhiked. 
We hitchhiked, and 
she had a brother that lived on a 
farm, I don™t know how many 
kilometers aw ay, because I 
have no idea of things 
like this. We came to her brother, and I rememb er she put me up like in a part 
where, you know, nobody could see me. And 
I was there for maybe a week or so, I 
don™t know how long either, because I ha
ve no Œ I had no perception of time 
whatsoev er. And after awhile the brother sa
id to her, listen, you can™t stay here, 
because if they discover that you have a 
Jewess here, th en you know what™s gonna 
happen, we™re all gonna get killed. So Œ 

Q: Just a quick question again, sorry. 
A: No, that al Œ 
Q: Was this the house of her 
brother or were you in Œ in 
[indecipherable].
 Was this 
a house, a farm? 

A: It was a farm. 
Q: It was a farm. 
A: Definitely a farm. I™m Œ he lived ther
e, you know, with his wife, I guess, and Œ 
and her mother was still alive, I reme
mb er that. You know, an older woman. 
Q: So, were you allowed to go into
 all the rooms inside the house? 

 
Interview with Ellen Kaidanow

12
A: No, I Œ I was just like Œ 
they used to say, like an 
apprivichik
(ph), I don™t know 
how to explain it, but they had like a wooden
 stove, and then on 
top used to be like 
warm, you know? And I reme mb er s Œ bei
ng th ere, like cooped  up, you know, 
hidden. And so she said, y
ou know wh at? I™ll go back  and I™ll see, because you 
know, she didn't  know what happened. So  
I remember she went away for a day or 
so, whatever, I don™t know how long it took.
 And wh en she came 
back she said, I 
can™t take her back because nobody™s there any more, they™re all killed.  

Q: So sh e went back  to look fo r your family? 
A: She went back to the 
family, to the ghetto, and th
e ghetto by that time was 
completely liquidated, nobo
dy was there. So she came
 back and th en  she had 
another sister that lived also on 
a farm, but the farm was called the a 
houtur
(ph) 
which means that it was isolated. It was 
like the farm, and then it was nobody all 
around, you know, not too many 
people around. So we stay
ed with that sister fo r 
quite awhile. And I don™t know wh at I wa
s doing, I remember going out with the 
cows, or with the horses and you know, li 
Œ she had one son, and it was very good 

to me. I would Œ never had any suffering, 
I never had Œ I was never hungry, because 
on a farm, you know? And this wo man, 
Lerna
(ph) who took me, she was like crazy 
about me, and I loved her so mu ch, that
 she was everything to me, you know? 

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Ellen Kaidanow  
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
13
A: And I was very lucky, because I was be
loved by her, so I didn
™t feel Œ I didn™t 
feel like, you know, like I was trash and so
mething like that. And I don™t know how 
long we stayed there. We 
stayed there for quite awhile
. And then  she had another 
sister by the name of 
Anya
, and she lived in the city, 
which was not any more the 
city of 
Dubno
, but it was called 
Ro vna .  
Was 
Rovna
, let™s see, what was it? No, not
 
Rovna
. I Œ I have to think of the 
name. In Russian it was called 
Krasnoarmiisk
. 
But really, it was 
Radziwi
ów
, you know, and th  Œ when  the Ru ssians were there 
because it was constantly Russian, 
Polish, German, Russian. So it was 
Radziwi
ów
. And there we had an  apar
tment, and I lived with 
Lerna
(ph) and her 
sister
 Anya
. And in fact, you know, when  the Ru
ssians came, they Œ the bombings 
were there and we were like in a Œ sort 
of in a bunker hiding from the bombs, and 
her sister w as hit with the shrapnel in her 
arm; I was sitting right next to her. And I 
remember there was a certain flower on th
e table, that for years afterwards I 
couldn™t Œ cause the mingling with  the blo
od and everything, I couldn™t smell those 
flowers, you know, like every time I s Œ ha
d those flowers, I s Œ like nauseous. And 
you know, during th e time, I can™t like 
tell you everything. The way I went to 
church , and you know, wearing th e cross and 
I used to play with th e kids, and some 
of the kids said that I™m a Œ a Œ a Jewe
ss, you know, and she denied it because she 
said that I was her child, that™s
 how I survived, as a child of 
Lern a
(ph).

Q: Were you Œ were you then
 raised as a Christian? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yes, but at night she used to remind 
me, because she was so
 wonderful that I 
can™t even begin to tell you.
 And I didn't want to Œ I 
Œ be Œ be remi nded that I™m 
Jewish, I really didn™t want to, you know,
 but at night she kept saying to  me, you 
know, I don™t rememb er if she talked Jewish
 to me or something, couple of word s, 
whatever. But yes, I was runn
ing around as a Christian girl. And Œ and, you know, 
so then after the war, when 
Œ not Œ it wasn™t really afte
r the war, it was just a time 
when our town was lib
erated. So I had an uncle, my 
father™s brother, his wife and 
their son, they were saved in
 Russia
 and they lived in 
Siberia
. So, they had written 
to our town, if there™
s anybody left from Œ 
my  maid en  name was 
Leviatin
(ph)
 Œ 
Lev -- Leviatin
(ph), but you know, you have
 to s Œ in English it™s 
Leviatin
(ph). So 
she had written to somebody, I 
don™t know to whom, and th
ey said they think that 
one child was left. And on that sc
ore, she came all the way from 
Siberia
, and sh e 
met me. I was at that time r
unning like to school, and she met me  on th e street, and 
she said, oh my God, you know, I™m Œ I™m 
Janyet
(ph), her name was 
Janyet
(ph), 
and Œ and I Œ 

Q: She was their sister? 

 
Interview with Ellen Kaidanow  
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
15
A: She was my aunt through marriage. He
r husband and my father were brothers. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I ran away from her. I said, I™m not
 Jewish, I™m a Ukrainian. I™m Œ I Œ I™m a 
devoted Œ I even remember, 
because she reminded me. I didn™t rememb er that, but 
she reminded me afterwards that I said, I™m
 Œ you know, like an 
Œ in Russian I said, 
I™m a
 steeron
(ph) 
kryinka
(ph), which means that I™m 
a devoted Ukrainian, and I 
ran away from her. But she persisted an
d she came back and Œ and she took me 
back with her. And 
Lerna
(ph) said the only reason she™s giving me up is because 
she fi Œ felt that I would have a better lif
e with them than with her, because they 

could give me papers and pe
ncils and I could be educat
ed, whereas she hardly had 
anything. So , my  aunt took me, and she took me back to
 Siberia
, to her. And I was 
devastated. To leave 
Lerna
(ph) was like worse than wh
en I left my parents, 
because, I mean, she was everyt
hing to me. And Œ and I st
ayed with them, and then 
when the Russians sai d  that
, you know, Polish citizens can go back , we all went 
back to Œ first to Œ was,
 you know a Œ a trip from 
Russia
 almo st took a month, I 
remember. And we came to 
Poland
, 
Ló dz
, and then from there to 
Czechoslovakia
, 
from 
Czec hoslovakia
 to 
Germany
, and at that time we were in a 
DP 
camp which 
was called 
Bad Reichenhall
. And that was in 
Germany
. And there we stayed for 
quite awhile. And then my aunt, for what
ever reason, she had a sister in the 
United 

 
Interview with Ellen Kaidanow  
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
16
States, 
so she said Œ you know, th
ere was an orphanage called 
preen Œ 
preenum
(ph) 
kindsai
(ph)
 
in  
Germany
. And she decided to send me and her son, 
her own son 
Victor,
 as my brother to this camp, becau
se she wanted us to come to u 
Œ the 
United States,
 wh ere she had a sister. But unbeknownst to us Œ so we were in 
that camp for about a yea
r, and finally, you know, our quota came through and I 

came to the 
United States 
on a boat called General
 Black
, with my cousin, who 
was my  bra Œ you know, like my  br
other. And wh en we got to th e 
United States 
we 
discovered that the aunt who was supposed 
to be like everything to  us, prepare a 
house for us and money and you know, all th
e things and take us
 in and blah, blah, 
blah, but she died away Œ she di
ed three weeks before we came. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And Œ and sh e Œ they didn™t want to
 let us know, you k
now? So, they had a 
daughter by bern i Œ by the name of
 Bernice
, she was sic Œ all of 16 years old, she 
was the one that took us, both my self and my  cousin, my  Œ
 Victor. 
And th ey lived  
in 
Freeport, Long Island
 at the time. Her f Œ their father was very busy, and it™s 
funny Œ irony th at he also had the Œ lik
e a candy store, so he was busy night and 

day. And we remained with these Œ with th is cousin, an d you 
know, with all kinds 
of troubles. I mean, sh e liked me, she didn
™t like him, he had to go live someplace 
else. But eight months la
ter, my Œ the same au nt, 
Anya
 and uncle, my father™s

brother, came to the u Œ finally came to the 
United States
, and we sort of became a 
family again, whole again, and Œ 
Q: With
 Victor? 
A: With 
Victor
, right. 
Q: Okay . 

A: You remember. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And by that time, actually 
Bernice™s 
father, by the name of 
Norm an
, he got us 
an apartment in the 
Bronx, 
and they registered me to school, to high school. I don™t 
know, I Œ I think I lied about my age, cause 
my cousin was there, so I wanted to be 
in the high school too, a
nd I don™t know, they accep
ted me, don™t ask me how, 
because I really did not have any educa
tion whatsoever. How 
I pulled through, I 
don™t know, but I did graduate high school. 
Q: You know roughly how ol
d you were at that time? 
A: When Œ when I 
came here to the
 States, 
I was like 12 and a half or 13. 
Q: Wow. So six years of suffering, and then Œ 

A: Pardon? 
Q: Six years, roughly 
six years of suffering. 
A: Oh, yeah.

Q: Moving in Œ from one place to the other. 
A: Oh yeah, right, definitely. I me an, a
nd you know, I can™t tell you everything. I 
mean, like, when I was with 
Lerna
(ph), you know, we Œ I us
ed to go to funerals. 
Now I think back  of it, because you know, you don™t think ab out those things. I 

remember going to wakes, you 
know, because the kids used 
to have Œ on a grenade, 
they would si Œ go on th e grenad e at Œ af
ter the war, even, and blown up and th en I 
used to have like nightmares,
 you know? Noth ing, so then
 I Œ you know, went here 
to school, in Œ in th e 
Bro nx
, 
Ta ft
 High School, I graduated, and right after that I 
met my husband, we got married. He was take
n into the army after we got married, 
I was pregnant. So, my son was like Œ you 
know, we got an apar
tment, I was alone 
for nine months. When he came back, my
 son was nine months
 old, and he was 
actually born in an army hos
pital in Œ where was it? On 
Staten Island, Govern or™s 
Island
, you know. And I Œ you know, I mean
, you can™t tell everything, but Œ 
Q: No. 
A: Œ you can imagine my feelings. I used 
to go to the army  docto rs, and I didn't 
know anything about children, cause I wa
s never around child
ren, I never knew 
anything about it. And I mean, crying like
 Niagara Falls
 every single day. And I 
don™t know, somehow you surv ive, you know.

Q: Were you afraid that something would ha
ppen to him, when  he
 left to the war? 
Or when  he was enlisted? 
A: You Œ you mean my  husband? 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you Œ 
A: Well, na Œ yeah, well what happened  wa
s, we tried to postpone his service. We 

used to go to  congressmen, and to the ra
bbi and ev erything to  say that, you know, 
I™m alone and I™m with child and I can™t be
 without him, but nothing helped. But the 
judge delayed it so that he was just aw
ay nine months. You know what I mean? 
Because by the time th ey process the pa
pers and everything 
Œ he was stationed 
someplace in 
California
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: When he came back, my son was alrea
dy nine mo nths old. And I don™t know, 
slowly but surely, I mean, 
there™s other things, you know
. When  we got married we 
lived in a one room apartment by other peop
le, and you know, it™s Œ all these things 
are Œ I don™t know how important 
they are to this conversation. 
Q: Everything is important. 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, you know. So, I lived with one fa
mily, and Œ and she was very mean to us, 
so we mo ved out and we lived with anothe
r family, and then finally we got our own 
apartment. And the other story is that, mir
acu lously, I found my mother™s sister here

in the
 States
. It™s not that I found her. I remember
ed something, that there™s an aunt 
in the 
United States, 
but I did not know her name
, I didn™t know Œ you know, 
New 
York
, number one. There was no way for me 
to find out anything. Bu t one of our 
landsmen, who came from our town, it was ju
st this crazy, crazy thing. He was 
walking on 
Pitkin
 Avenue
, 
and he was looking for someb
ody else. So they Œ he wa 
Œ went into a tobacco shop, 
and he was looking for a Mr. 
Guyer
(ph). So he went in 
and he asked him wh ether 
he™s related to other 
Guyers
(ph) from Œ that were in 
Israel
. So he said no, but then  he asked 
him, where do you come from? And he 
said, I come from
 Dubno.
 And he said, you know, I ha
ve a niece that comes fro m 
Dubno
, too. And the niece turned out to be 
my mother™s sister. And she came, she 
really saved my life, because when  I wa
s all alone with my son, I didn't know 
anything about raising the 
kid. And she came and she 
stayed with me, and she 
helped me, you know, to tell 
me what to do and, you know,
 how to feed him and so 
on and so  forth. And you know, from that tim
e on, we Œ we sort of picked ourselves 
up. He came back and he wo
rked  in a bakery , then he had this own bakery, and 
that™s Œ that™s a Œ I™d Œ I think it™s like 
Œ more or less, in short, you know.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: A short history. 
Q: An amazing Œ an  amazing story, really. During your Œ

A: Oh, the other thing that I wanted to 
tell you, which I think is very important, 
because after our city was lib
erated, my mother had, yo
u know, given a few things 
to a Czech woman, b
ecause I was like very peculiar, I had to sit in my own seat and 
I had my  own ch air and all that, and I wo
uldn™t eat unless it™s my  own spoon. So, 
when  she Œ 
Lerna
(ph), the one that saved me , came  to this Czech woman, and she 
wanted to  say Œ to get some 
things that my mother left 
with her. She said, you better 
get out of here, or I™m gonna say that yo
u have a chi Œ a Œ a Jewess with you. Bu t 
the only thing th at she did give me is th
e spoon, like a soup sp oon, which I have to 
this day. And I don™t know if y ou want to ask me anything else. 
Q: Yes. I™d like to know if you ever went back to 
Dubno
? 
A: No. 

Q: You™ve never been  back. 

A: No, I never went back, no. 

Q: And wha Œ did you 
ever hear again from 
Lerna
(ph ) ? 
A: So this Œ from 
Le-Lerna
(ph)? Since I married, fore ver, I™ve been sending her 
money and packag es and we 
Œ I have beautiful letters 
from her, beautiful. And, you 
know, I was like Œ you know, we
 ourselves were very poor, I couldn™t take her here, 
so I never saw her again. Bu t we Œ I have a lot of correspondence with her, and we 

helped her as much as possibl
e, and I have pictures of 
her. And wh at happened , she,

of course, eventu ally passed away. And her sister 
Anya
, with whom I 
lived towards 
the end of the war, the one that
 was hit on the shrapnel, wh en
 Lerna
(ph) died, I 
became her surrogate, more or less, you kn
ow, sending her things. And now that she 
was passed away, I™m Œ to this day, in fa
ct I have now a package again to send to 
her daughter. And th e daughter lives in 
Lv iv Œ  Lv ov , 
the u Œ the 
Ukra ine. 
And she 
just called me the other day, so I™ve alwa
ys been sending money, packages, and I™ve 
always been  in touch with her. 
Q: That™s amazing. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I have one last Œ 
A: The only thing that I didn™t do, and I 
really regret it, I guess maybe it™s not too 
late, she was a Righteous Gentile
 and I somehow never went to 
Yad Vashem
 to 
report that. 
Q: Well, you can still do that. 
A: Yeah, I was gonna say that I could still 
do that. But, you know
, being Œ we were 
young, we were s Œ you know, strugg
ling ourselves, raising th e children. 
Q: Under such circumstances, yeah. 

A: And I wasn™t Œ you know, I wasn™t su
ch a big hero, you know wh at I mean? 
Like, I don™t know, we just neglected it,
 I guess. But I didn™t neglect her. I just

neglected to , you know, make it Œ and I neve
r talked about it, now fi Œ finally we 
talk about it. I never talked 
to my children, I have three 
children, six grandchildren, 
and I din Œ I did not like to talk about it. 
But I think now, sort
 of, I don™t know, it™s 
amaze Œ I™m amazed myself th
at I™m even talking.
