this poe m M ay 11, 1980. 

When ages of civi lizati on crumble to dust  

And dea t h is  ragi ng s upr e me  

When t he Devil i s crowne

Then freedom is a far away dream.  

When all that you love
d is taken fr om you 
And you are  stripped 
to the bare bone  

Wh en all mo ral boundaries
 and laws are broken 
Then you are in Hell with Satan alone. 

Whe n J e ws are depi cte d as s ub-huma n, as  ver min 

And br ute force and evil prevail  

When Nazi doctors turn
 children to corpses 
Then all l ogi c and reason fai ls. 

Whe n t he whole  worl d r e mains  dea d silent  

With the exceptio
n of just a few 
Then they gr ant Satan 
license and opportunity 
To mur der  i n t he gas  c ha mbers  a  God-lovi ng Je w. 

Whe n ma n a nd woma
n ar e kept  apart  
And ne w li fe  is not  c onc e i ved 

When there is no soun
d of laught er or song 
How ca n God by man be percei ve d?  

Wh en ma ss mu rder of 
t h e Je ws bec o me s le gal  
Under  the ba nner  of a n i d eolo
gy or  God's sacr ed na me  
The n i t s not  the victi ms  but t he 
nazi  murder ers  who di d not  resi s t
 Satan and defi
le God's name. 
Whe n li ving skelet ons are  marc hing at gunpoint  

Through the gate of Auschwitz in
 long column s of fi ve, cold, st
arve d, for ced to har d l abor 
What  power on eart h gave the m t he st rengt h t o sur vive?  

When all  heads are shaved
, all  huma n ri ght s deni ed 
And all wear  the  sa me  ki nd of
 __________ str ipe d dres s  
Whe n t o wor ship God be comes  a  cri me  

The n t he  whole world is  i n a  very terri ble me ss . 

Wh en Hitler's dreams
 become a reality 
And the nazi 's send Jews to the left and to the right 

The n such men are not  r u led by God's divi ne power  

But  by their  own burni ng a m

Whe n t he so-calle d s uper i or Ari an na z i  race

To murder 6 million
 Jews merely for 
being born Jewish 
That I don't believe was God,
 but Hitler's  
demonic will.

That  e xpl ains a  lot  to us. 

Q: Why don't we , I 'd like to begi
n by havi ng you tell me your na me
, dat e of birth a n d where you  
were born, and a little bit 
about your family.  And 
you might tell me your na
me now and your name  
at bir th. 

A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz.  I wa
s  na med a f ter  my mat erna l  great- grandmother It ka  
who was als o bor n in Poland.  
A nd my fa mily n a me, my p a r e nts n a me, wa s Ci m- mo -nella- s i mo n  
(ph) .  M y fa mil y __________ use  to
 call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yu
m-fa-yet ska (ph), a name whi ch I 
like to be called.  I was born 
April 15, 1926 during
 Passover, the Jewish
 holi da y celebr ating 
_________.  I was th
e oldest of t hre e sibli ngs .  I was bor
n i n a s mall town, Chair -han-off ( ph)  
Pol and, loc a t ed about 90 kilometer s nort h of Wa rsa w
.   At  th e ti me  whe n  the  Nazi s c a me i n,  I wa s  
13 years old and the popula
tion of our home town, Chair- han-off 
(ph) Poland was 
about  15,000.  A 
little less than half of that wa
s Jewish.  My fa mily 
consisted at that ti
me of my parents,  
___________ Hymen, my little
 brother Soo-lick (ph), 
my little sister 
Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal  
widowe d gra ndmother , ___________
__ ____________.  My a ncest ors on
 my mo the r 's side ca me t o  
Pol a nd fr om Ger ma n y ar ound the 16
th
 century.  Four gene
rations were still aliv
e and each one had a 
lot of chil dr en because t hey came
 fr om an ort hodox ba ckground.  So my  gr
andmother wa s one of 
seve n s i bli n gs.  M y mot her wa s one  of s even si b
lings.  M y Aunt who li ve
d also i n Chair-han- o ff 
(ph) had als o se ven chil dren.  M y
 ot her Uncle ha d thre e c hildren.  
They al l had, the younger ones  
had les s bec ause  we di dn't  ha ve  enough opport unity 
before t he war t o have 
more chil dren.  So we 
had a very large famil y.  I  feel 
t hat bot h my par ent s and my gran
dmother were my first t eachers and 
my first role mo dels.  I reme
mber when I was a little
 girl, my grandmothe
r used, who was an  
extre me l y re ligious woman, obs ervant
 wo ma n ,  at ho me we
 only spoke Yi ddish.
  We o bser ved t he  
Je wish l a ws, cust oms a n d tradi tio
ns.  And my gra ndmother was wear
i ng a  sha ytle ( ph) , in Yiddi s h 
its called, and it's called 
a  wi g in Engli sh, but not t o be auti fy 
he rsel f but for religi ous  pur pos es.  For  
my gra nd mother reli gi on wa s not jus t  a beli e f, it
 wa s a wa y  o f li fe whi c
h effected t he way she 
behave d, t he  wa y s he dre ssed, t he wa y she ta ught 
us.  And I re me mber t hat
 ever y morni ng when I  
would get up my gra ndmother woul d say with me th
e pr ayer s a nd in t he e ve ning she would sa y with 
me t he pr ayers.  She used to gi ve
 me coins to put in 
the push- ka (ph), whi ch is cal l ed her charity  
box, and she  would tell 
me , "Yit-col a (ph) , to he lp those who 
are less fort unat e than we are is our  
mitzvah (ph), our commandm
ent."  I remember one time I was s
till a preschooler, didn't know one  
coin fr om another , and 
a poor man ca me t o our do
or and asked my grandmother for al ms .  And my 
grandmot her  gave me s o me c ha nge
, some c oins, I had no ide a th
e val ue of it but I looke d in my  
hand and I  s aid, " Gra ndma , so mu
c h  money? "  And my gra ndmother  
s aid, "My chil d, 
you only ha ve  
what you gi ve a wa y."  I  ques tio
ned my gra ndmo t her 's pr over b be
c aus e I coul dn't understa nd it , 
being so li ttl e, how can you give 
a w ay somethi n g and still have it? 
 So my gra ndma  bega n with a 
s mi l e and sa ys, " Yit-c ola  (ph), I onl y give what G
od and my parent s have give n me.  I 'm not givi ng  
mi ne."  This  is how she fel t .  And 
s h e taught me lots of Yiddi sh song
s, told me lots 
of stories.  I 
ca me fr o m a  fa mi l y  o f  st
ory-t ellers .  And since, at
 that time, tech
nology wa s not de
veloped so mu ch 
so, and my grandmother ha d lot s
 of chi l dren.  In fact , when
 Ge r m any i nvade d Pol and, my 
grandmot her  had fi ve married chil dr en, 21 great
-children and one gr eat- g
randchild.  Only one  
granddaughter, which I'm go ing to speak about a little later, her na
me was also Yit-cola (ph).  I was 
eight  years old when she emigr ate
d to Palestine in
 1934, to get married w
ith s o me bo d y  wh o wa s,  
without her boyfriend, that she met 
also in Poland, Check-han-off (p
h), who wa s from t he sa me city, 
the same, and he left  a lit
tle earli er, so she went  there to marr y 
hi m.  An d I r e me mb
er that the whol e 
fa mily was gathered and 
everybody was cryi
ng and saying, "God knows if
 we will see each other

agai n."   And my grandmother , who wa s a woma n of 
ver y de ep fai t h, trie d 
to comfort  us and s h e  
said, "Yit -cola (ph) , ______ ______
_ ________, don't cry.  Wit h God al l things are pos sibl e."  I  
always a d mi red my gr andmot her 's str e ngt h be caus e  
she lived t hrough Worl d 
War One.  She lost a 
brot her , she lost her husband, sh
e lost two of her child
ren, that was before 
the Holocaust, and she  
lost a gra nddaughter .  But  she neve
r lost her unshakable fa ith in Go
d.  And she al ways  belie ved a nd 
she never questioned.  And it seem
ed to me the more she suffered
, the more s he be lieve d and t he 
kinder she  was, so she was a  wo
nderful role model for 
me .  And she  lived wi
t h us from t he  da y I  
was born.  And she was the only one in my family
 who wa s pr i vileged t o di
e a natur al death shortly  
aft e r Ger ma ny i nva de d Pol a nd.  From e a rly chil dho
od on my par ent s and gra ndmot her stre sse d t o  
us childre n the mea ni ng a nd i mp ortance of
 _________ _____
___, whi c h i n Englis h mea n s  
huma nness .  Whe ne ver  I  woul d do
 s o methi ng that di dn't me a sure  
up to the yardst
ick of ________ 
________, t hey never sc rea med at 
me, the y di dn't hit me, but  they woul d expla i n t o me why it 's  
wr ong, and usually the y wo
uld s ay, " Yit-c ola  (ph) , 
its not ______ _______." 
 I  use t o cringe when  
they said this here beca
use I kne w that the y di sa ppr ove d a nd eve ntuall y I  starte d to view mysel f  
through that yardstick.  You k
now, when I did somethi
ng I felt always will my
 parents approve? 
But  they also, what  they did al so 
is t hat t he y, when I  di d s o mething 
good they used 
to praise me.  
And I really felt that they love
d me unconditionally
 and that was a wonderful 
gift.  But they were 
strict wit h me.  Wh en I was alre
ady a sc hool girl , I re me mber  in 
Poland was very col d winters and 
some of t he  kids , and we were
 wearing old wool so
cks, stocki ngs I mea n, a nd I don't eve n  
re me mber how t hey use  to hol d up but I re me mber
 the y we re always r o lling up, t he y we re like  
_________ you know a nd t h
e  ki ds didn't  like  it .  So a few kids
 put  on knee socks  a n d I wante d t o  
wear knee socks too.  So I reme mb er that I aske
d my pare nt s, can I put  
on t he  knee  soc ks?   And 
they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too 
c ol d".  And I wa s na ughty and I fi
gur e d I 'm not going t o start t o  
convince the m, I felt I ' m not goi ng t o
 be c old, __________
________, s o what di
d I do?   I we nt i n  
and I put t h e knee s ocks  under neat h my st oc kings and 
I we nt  to school.  My father often use d to 

come t o the school yard because 
he had act uall y t wo kinds of, firs t 
we wer e in the dair y busine ss , 
like whole sa l e dair y busi ness , but he wa s with a 
partner and obvi ousl y I do
n't know why, whether 
they, li ke the  part ner shi p diss olved,
 a n d then he  sta rted t o work in 
photography and picture fra mi ng .  
So he used to travel sometimes 
a nd whene ver he  would 
c o me home , or be for e  he le ft, if I was n 't 
home , t he sc hool wa sn't fa
r to dr op in and sometimes even br
ing me some good
ies or something, 
just to see me.  So that particul
ar mor ning, I went to school a n d 
it was re ce ss and some of the ki ds 
starte d to sa y, " Yit- col a (ph) , your  fa ther is  he re."  
 And I  di dn't know wha t  
to do.  I was wearing the 
knee socks.  And my fat h er looked 
at me, and I'll never forget for as 
long a
s I live, tha t  look, and he  
said, " Yit-c o la (ph), I fee l  ver y 
__________ and di sappoi
nted i n you.  Be ca use ever ybody c an make 
a mi stake, but when a pe
rson lies , he deli berat el y de ceives 
you a nd t his i s not
 ____________ an d 
I 'm very disa ppointe d."  An
d I felt s o terrible and I  starte d to cr y 
and as k for give nes s, so he fixed me  
up and said, I was still not so old 
yet, and he said to me, I'll ne
ver fo rget it, "Yit-cola (ph),  
ever ybody ma kes a mi s t ake but onl y a fool ma kes 
t wice t h e same.  And in
 everyt hing there is a 
lesson.  So I  hope that 
you have lear ned, that you ca nnot lie
 wit hout be c o ming a liar  and hel ping 
other people."  The reason I am shari ng thi s stor
y is because I  found out la
ter when the Nazis came 
in, when everythi ng was  dece pti on,
 how important it is to
 speak t he tr uth and 
not to lie, and you 
know how justice is important.  
I r e me mb er on e  ti me  I was wal k
ing home from sch
ool al one and a  
bunch of ki ds t hat I di dn't kn
ow, and wh o did not know me, a
ttacked me both verbally an d  
physically.  I tried to free
 mysel f but t he ci rcle closed around 
me  and I  felt  punc he
s  comi ng all ove r . 
And I coul dn't , it was both the phys
ic al pain and the e mot ional  beca
use t hat  was my first encount er  
with an incident like this here, 
with anti-Semitism.  An
d I couldn't understand 
why.  Why are they  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

so angry wit h me?   Why do they 
hat e  me  s o muc h?   I was too yo
ung to under sta nd it and I ca me  
home crying bitterly.  Usually I 
was not a cry baby and 
my mother saw that so mething serious must  
have happened, she was  home .  A
nd she asked me, " Yit- cola  (ph) , what 's happe ned? "   You'll s ee  
later why those t hings are i mpor
t ant , because of the val ues. 
Q: So your mother  a s
ked you wh at happened? 
A: What ha ppe ne d.  I re lated t o 
her t he whole st ory.  And s he  did 
not s ay a single wor d, s he j ust  
took me l ovi ngl y in he r a r ms  a nd she  tried t o c o mf
ort me.  After I finally 
quieted down a nd stoppe d 
crying, she l ooked at me  and sh
e asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and 
what did you do?"  And I was 
shocke d.  I said, " Not hi ng."  A
nd my mot her looke d __________
_________, she sa id, " We ll m y  
child, t hen you have not hing to 
cry a bout.  Your ___
___ _______ doe s not de
pe nd on how ot her s 
treat you but  on how you treat other s."  And I re
me mbe r  my fa mily ta u ght me that my __ __ __ _  
_______ does not depe nd on how ot hers trea t me but how I treat others , whi ch had a  tre me ndous 
impact on me up to  this date.  Because
 they taught me how never to 
hel d other s, how not t o s ha me  
or held other s beca use its  not 
_________ _________
_.  But t hey never ta ught me , what should I do 
wh en I am held, how should
 I  re spond?   So what I 
us ed t o do, I us e to cr y. 
 Because I knew I cannot 
held anybody and I  ca nnot
, and a not her t hing which 
they taught me , is that
 no one can br eak my  
spirit as long as I d
on't do something evil.  As lo
ng as I don't do somethin
g wrong.  So t he y act uall y 
very much stressed __
________ ________, Yiddish _______, 
________ ________
__.  I received 
bot h, li ke I s aid at home we s poke Yi ddis h but in 
school we s poke Polis h a
nd I had als o, I we nt to  
Bant-tee-os-kov (
ph), which was a Je
wish and Hebrew sch
ool.  My little brother 
actually started at  
age t hree.  My parents we
re both culturally and religiously Jewi
sh but they were 
not orthodox.  But 
in those days, not orthodox
 was mor e t han today, j u st like beca
use we obser v ed al
l the holidays, we 
had ____________ i n our  
home , and we li ved acc ordi ngl y to t h
e Je wi sh te achi ngs and cust oms a nd  
traditi ons .  Bec ause my mot her was  the onl y one 
of my gra ndmother 's c hildre n who didn't wear  a  
sha ytal ( ph) , who di dn't wea r  a wig, beca use my  
mother was  a ver y artis tic per son.  She ha d a  
beautiful voice and I remember s
till how she used to sing to me, t
each me Yiddish songs.  Because 
be for e  my  mo ther  was  mar r ied , she  bel on ged  to  
a J e wish dr a ma group a nd 
she use t o pl ay in the  
Yiddish Theater.  An
d at  that  ti me, t h e Yiddish Theater  used
 t o be t he ________
 ________, li ke a 
regul ar theat er but the y had t hat 
i n t he fire hous e, you know?   Wh
ere the firemen lived, so they  
would allow them there.  But af
ter she was marri ed an
d s he ha d a fa mil y s h
e would do it onl y for  
charit y.  So my pare nts very often used to ta ke 
me t o the theater and my
 mother belonged to a 
literary group.  She was more
, she was very artistic. 
 If she would have had 
the opportunity
 then she
 
would have done much
 more, but unfortunately.  And I think 
that she instilled in me  a love for 
literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, 
because as I said, my gr
andmother had lots of 
grandc hildr e n and chi l dr en.  Excep
t for one s on and one cousin, you 
know the cousi n  that left i n  
1934, my cousin Yitle
 Pash-o-vick (ph), an
d one of my Uncles 
who left when he 
was 18 years old, I 
never kne w hi m.  I  kne w  hi m only 
through photographs and through le
tt er s that t he famil y used t o 
get fr om England, London.
  Because that 's wher e 
he  marrie d  and he li ve d. 
 So the whole fa mily 
lived i n Pol a nd and we used to be a very close-kn
i t  fa mil y.  So we got to
ge ther and bec ause there  
wa s not, as  I  ha d me ntioned be fore
, t echnol ogy, s o parts of, when we
 woul d get t oget he r  the y use d  
to, t he fa mil y us ed t o sit and t e ll st ori e s, re mi ni
s ce , you know?   And e very
body thought that I don't 
eve n pa y att ention and I wa s just si
t t i ng in a c orner and li sten and ta
ke in a ll these st ori es.  Another  
time  also that I heard a lot of st
ories is that in Pola
nd, Chair-han-off (ph), wh
ere we li ve d, t her e was  
onl y one  Synagogue .  But there wa
s  the  ___________, li ke  t hey call  
it, li ke t he study house  a nd a 
lot of the boys who came to study th
ere, t o t he Yit-shi va ( ph) , some 
of them we re fr om other cities 
so t hey used to be on Fri day or
 on holidays, my fa ther woul d a l wa
ys bring home , i n
 the He brew its 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

called ____________, or
 gue sts.  And then t here woul d be c onve
rsati on at t h e table and t hey used to 
ask hi m que stions and he  would tel l  a dve ntur es a n d st
ori es.  So it was , and one
 thing also, that after 
my mo th er wa s ma rried  
she didn't work so I al wa ys ha d my
 mothe r and my gra ndmother home , 
whi ch was a great i n fluence.  I re
me mber anot her s t ory whi ch al so 
ha d a ver y grea t infl uence on me , 
is that we di dn't ha ve runni ng wa
ter or electri city in our home.  
And wint er, to h
eat the house, we  
cooked on an iron stove, and to 
heat the house it used to be 
a tile oven, which 
reached from the 
fl oor , mos t  peopl e in Pol and had t hos e, and the y us
ed to, they wer e able 
t o ope n wells , you put t he 
wood t o he at  it, to ba ke potatoes a nd bake apple i n
 ther e some ti me s, 
but mostly the winter time this 
would be the source of heat , th
at heated t he house. 
 So when t hey came
 on the holidays and  
___________, they 
woul d sit ar ound the ove n and tell thes e st ories .  And s o I hea r d a l ot of st orie s  
and I knew a lot about  Jewi sh l i fe.
  An d I  was a l wa ys , wh en  I star
ted to go t o s chool , one of my  
worst s ubje c t s wa s his t or y.  Beca use the way it was 
pre sent ed, it was j ust t o me a bunc h of da tes ,  
long ago, and a lot of pl aces.  But 
it  was not presented as r el evant
 to our  life and I had no idea 
be for e the Holoc aust how hi stor y e ffects our li ve s,
 beca use hi story is ma de by people and it e f fect s  
people .  And I wa s a cre a tive c hild.  I love d to sing,
 I loved to write and to 
read, I was forever doing 
this.  And I wa s drea mi ng that whe n
 I, a fter I finis hed publ ic s chool, t hat I goi ng to c ontinue t o have  
more for mal education, that 
I 'm goi ng to be come  a write r.
  Even as a young girl 
I used to write a lot.  
An d I re me mb er my  fat her al w a ys  
wa s s o pr oud of me, my pare nts , 
my grandmot her , and my fat h e r  
used to take me a lot wi
t h hi m s o wh en we we nt so me plac e h e  
always sai d, " Yit- cola (ph) , recit e a  
poem."  And I was bl
essed until this day to God with a goo
d memory and I've learned the poems  
and I learned lots of songs, both at
 home .  And a n other  source  of, I r e
memb er that it 's  al most funny, 
that t here used t o peop
le  who would go i n t he courtya rd and 
sing and pla y inst
rume nt s and some  
had wonder ful voice s a n d pl aye d wel l , a nd pe ople  
woul d t hrow t he m down 
mo ne y.  S o  I r e me mb e r  
onc e I was goi ng home , it was  on a  Fri da y, I  was 
goi ng home  from sc hool.
  And t hos e peopl e  
played in our yard and I always want ed to lear n 
a ll the songs , so they s ung a ne w song.  I caught  
most of it but not all the words fo
r the first time, so I 
fi gured they probably w
ill not sing it again in 
the s a me c o urtya r d s o I  followed t h e m.  And I got 
so involved that I completely forgot that its 
Friday a nd t he fa mil y is  going to
 be  ready, the sha- bot ( ph)  was obse rved ver y stric tly.  And I  

remember I came 
home, the candles were lit al
ready, and my father was 
sitting because the sha-bot 
(ph) wa s ver y strict ly obs erve d, a nd here I ca me in
 and my mot her l ooked 
at  me , a nd she  said, " Yit-
cola ( ph), quickly.  
Go in and wash
 up.  Come to sha-bot 
(ph)."  And I  was so grate ful t hat  she  di dn't  
screa m at me or  anything.  An
d I  re me mber  the  hol ida ys and s ha-
bot  (ph), but li ke I menti one d  
be for e, I wa s bor n during Pa ss over , so Pass over 
wa s my birt hda y and we  alwa ys fait hfull y, e ver y 
year , we obs erve d Pa ss over.  And it wa s so di ffe r en
t than it is now because 
every single object of 
the house was taken out in the cour
ty
ard.  Di she s wer e  ch
ange d.  And at t h at 
ti me, I re me mb er , we  
didn't ha ve r egul ar mattr esse s like today, we had so
me burla p sacks and it wa s wit h str aw, it was put 

in the, t hey changed th
e  stra w.  And pai nt t he house a nd wa
sh e ver y obje c t.  I t  wa s mor e  for 
cleanli ness, it was also because 
of t he holida y, so Pass over  was bot h a  physical a n d spirit ual  
cleansing and I r e memb er, t he reas
on why I  s p eak about  Passover , 
i s beca use  it i s ve ry, it  is  
coincide ntal , beca use I was born on Passover a nd 
I was li ber at ed on Pa ss over, duri ng Passover , the  

liberation.  And I was thinking th
at be for e, whe n we sa t at the 
_________, and we 'r

slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery,
 about the plagues, abou
t starvation, I couldn't 
underst and t his here .  Be caus e up

My faith in God was not te

 and I c ouldn't unde rst a

I remember, no

I  said, I 'm not  surpri se d that pe

wa y.  The y cannot relate  bec aus e,
 to give you an example, if 
some one , God for bid, has a  terri bl e  
illness then when he talks with so
mebody who is heal
thy at that time , the he
althy person could tal k  
about the future and relates di fferent to life , sees li
fe  differently, and this is 
here .  So, in my, it never  
entered my  mi nd that one da
y I will suffer like 
t h is here.  Tha t  my pe opl e w
ill  suffer li ke 
this he re. 
And I re me mber als o a n other i nci dent, its like I st ar
ted t o tell you, we didn't ha ve heat but , we di dn't 
have r unning water  and we di dn't ha ve  
elect ricity i n  our home , s o we  . . . 
Q: Let me j ust as k her e , you didn't  have t hese 
but that was  nor mal?   Yo
u were fairly middle 
income?  
A: Yeah, that wa s not because we were of pove
rty.  This wa s because in the small __________, 
nobody in the s ma ll _______
___ ha d it at that ti me.  So, in fac t , when I we nt now ba ck to Pola nd , 
they still have, some pe
ople have outhouses and 
things, you know? 
 But its so much
 more modern, 
its more  ____________ in
 the larger city.  But at that 
time it was common,
 you didn't know 
anyt hing di fferent  be caus e  I r e me mb
e r , my Aunt  li ved, my mot her 's 
sister , l i ved in War s aw.  When 
my  fa mil y t ook  me I  ca me  h o me a n d tol d all  my 
friends, I was excited, 
she had a toilet and you 
pulled t he st ring from t h e ceili ng and I sai d, "I t was 
like a mir acle t o me."  
So it was because t his 
was, I 'm describing the world th
e way I knew it and t his all i n fl
uenced, you know? 
 Because when 
there was not water in the 
hous e, so we  ha d a  wa te
r car rier who woul d br ing 
i n water .   We  di dn't  
have like today rea dy- ma de foods a nd, or you co
ul d go int o the  kosher butc her like t oda y and buy a  
chicken.  At that ti me 
we used t o go t o the ma
rket  which was t he market
 pl ace was t he place wher e 
Jews and Gentiles had the most 
relations, was the most involve
d, because they would bring  
livest oc k, chicke ns, t urke y and c o ws and they wo
uld bri ng ve geta ble and fruits .  The Je wis h pe opl e  
would bring what they ma
de, shoes and boots and clothes.  So that was the exchange because that  
was the most time when 
Jewish people interm
ingled with the Gentiles.  
And so those things were , 
the li fe was  di ffere nt a n d it infl ue nc ed di ffere nt
l y als o.  But  goi ng bac k  
now t o the  not havi ng 
electrici ty, even though we didn't 
ha ve el ectricit y we had a light , fr
om a nuft (ph) i t s call ed i n  
Polish, petroleum,  you know?  
Q: Kerosene? 
A: Kerosene , yes , I forgot the wor d, keros ene .  
So we ha d a  keros ene la mp.  And sti ll we woul d 
always sit a n d read a nd it wa s ver y, educati on was ex
tremely important.  And so I reme mb er that we  

didn't have a refrigerator. 
 We didn't have all the m
oder n applia nces beca us e  at that ti me nobody had 
the m i n our ___________. 

[e nd of si de 1 of ta pe 1]   So 
of c our s e we didn't  have any, we di
dn't have electricity, we  didn't have 
any re fri gera t or.  And we  use d t o 
st or e food in t he  root  cell ar.  We
 c alle d i t  root beca us e, besi des  
hol ding t he peris ha ble food we woul
d put  in the r e for t he wi nte r , s o
meti me s  my fathe r  w oul d g o t o  

the c ountr y and buy li ke  a whole 
sa ck of potat o es, carr ots , oni ons , 
for t he wi nter.   An d we  als o  
would keep there in the winter
 the  peri sha ble food, you know
, whe n we cooke d somet hing.  
Sometimes when it 
was very cold, I reme
mber my mother used to put 
it on the window sill, outside 
on the window sill, but mostly in th
e root cellar.  So one time, in 
the root cellar it was dark.  You  
had to, you ope
ne d, t her e was a s qua re in t he  kitc
hen floor wi th a ri ng, you pulle d up t he ri ng an d 
there was a l ong ladder.  It wasn't
 built in, it was put 
i n, and you had to wal k
 this, this ladder down, 
it was dark.  A dirt fl oor.
  No windows.  Cold.  It smelled wo
nder f ul wit h all the  di ffer ent kinds of 
vegetabl e thi ngs .  But it wa s dark a n d I was , as
 I menti oned be for e, I wa s only 13 when the war  

broke out a n d this was ea rlier, so 
I was afraid to go down
.  And my mother  notice d
 that I am afraid. 
She  sai d, "Li t  a ca ndl e."  She  ga ve
 me  the c a ndle t o my ha nd, a nd 
she tell me, she wa
ve d to me , for  
me , and she said, "Go Yi t-co
la ( ph) , go.  God is i n the root ce lla
r too."  And I loved her, I trust ed  
her, and I knew.  I understood th
at i f there woul d be danger for 
me she wouldn't s end me bec aus e

she was very protective of
 me.  In fact, I was ne
ver away one single day in
 my, until the Nazis came  
in, alone.  I  was al ways wit h 
the family.  So I walked down a
nd I brought up t he butter .  And 
aft er war ds I wasn't so afr a
id anymore of the dark root
 cellar.  For two reasons. 
 First of all, because I  
re me mb ered  my mo th er 's wor ds,  " G o, Yit- col a  ( ph)
, God i s i n the r oot ce
llar."  And s econdl y, for  
mysel f I t hought, i f I could do it once I can do 
it again.  And so at home it was warm, it was a 
wo nderful world.  My grandmother 
wa s, li ke I mentione d, she would not
 permit me to ta
ke  a bite of 
food wit hout saying _________
_, whi ch means a special  prayer
.  And al wa ys stress ed the 
i mport anc e.  Yiddis h gui de, the ment al gui de to
 her wa s _______
___.  And anot he
r thi ng whic h I  
do really appreciate a lot 
about my grandmother is, 
that whenever I did fo r 
her a little added.  She  
never took me for gra nt ed.  Sh
e would ma ny ti me s over sa y, " Oh 
my __________, 
Go d Bless you 
and thank you" , a nd s he  woul d make
 me  feel  s o  good.  
And one time I said, 
" Gr andma , it s j ust  a 
little thing."  I didn't call her grandma, I calle
d her ___________, ______
_____ for grandmother.  
And I said, "It's just a 
little thing."  And my 
grandmother would smile 
and she would say, she 
always , whe n I as ke d her  somet hing 
she had such a beauti ful, war m sm
ile, she said, "Yes my child.  
But kindness and caring are not 
little things."  And th
e reason why th
e _________ is later I fo und 
out how much those val ues helped 
t o sha pe me .  And als o of cour
se there was t he infl uence from 
fri ends.  In fact, I use d t o  have one fri end bec aus
e where we li ved, we lived 
at two a ddr e sses .  I wa s 
bor n in one house an
d then we move d.  And t he fir st house,  t he entrance was fr
om the back and I 
reme mb er like today, ther
e was a huge field and I us
ed t o play there.  And 
one of my  girlfriends was 
a Polish little girl, her na
me was Helenka (ph)
.  I cannot remember any lo
nger the last name, but w e  
used to play a lot together.  An
d I reme mber that she used to co
me like in the mo
r n ing whe n it  
snowed, wi nters were c o ld, s o I don't  know how 
its called in English but
 I would go out a nd la y 
down on t he  snow a nd make  a
 
Q: An an gel ? 
A: An angel ,  you know?   And wit h Helenka (ph) 
we would, you know?   A
nd the n I re me mber like  

today, I was always very
 happy child and I 
was playing.  A
nd I remember when
 I was little and I 
went to the field and I fel t  such
 a s ens e of __________, s o I woul d 
fl op my  hands like a  fel das (ph)  
and prete nd t hat I 'm a bir d and fl y.  And later , it ne
ver ent ere d my mi nd t ha t  one da y all this going to 
be gone.  That I will not have this
 anymore.  And then, everything 
all of a sudden 
changed when the 
Naz i s ca me  i n.  

Q: You me ntione
d thi s Polish girl
.  Did you have othe r friends or
 other neighbors who were not  
Je wish?  

A: We , there were not too man
y, not too ma ny.  We ha d some 
non-Jewish, and 
we had a good 
relationship to them.  Ac
tually, I personally, the on
ly serious incident of 
anti-Semitism was when I 
wa s walking home .  And 
anot her t h ing whic h a lso, but that  
was not, it was 
verbal, it was not 
attacked.  I once hear d a 
non-J e wis h child sa yi ng 
to me , "The houses  ar e y
ours but the streets ar e 
ours ."  And at that ti me  
i t  di dn't re fle ct, but  I 
coul d, also when I was thin
ki ng about  it I  said, " What  
do you me a n?   My fa mi ly 
li ves  her e  alrea dy for ,  my anc est ors 
came here in the 
1600's.  We  are 
citizens.  We  do everything.
  And yet, we're not looke
d as equals?"  You know,
 you sense a little bit.   
But  I pers onally di dn't sens e it 
so much.  I knew mo
re about it  from goi
ng t o He bre w s chool , 
knowi ng about the poe ms  fr om my gr an
dmother and my parents, use to 
tell how it was.  I also knew 
good thi ngs also about some nei ghbors, but we had 
pretty decent rel ationshi ps
.  It wasn't at that 
time , but that was after like, af
ter Pew-suit-ski (ph), Mal-shall-vi
c Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, things 
started to change.  And y
ou know, we were not treated, we were
 treated like second-class citizens in 
ma ny wa ys beca use whe n we want ed 
to go to higher studies, it started like a fe w years before the 
Hol oc aust , you couldn't  go, Je wis h
 pe ople  c oul dn't  go t o t he uni ve
rsit y, we  wer e not  all o we d.

Q: Wh at year are you talking? 
A: Wh at year?  I would 
say like in 1937 or 1
938 it started to get a li
ttle more because I don't 
remember t he exact year 
that Pew-suit-ski (p
h)  died, but t hings were 
a lot better.  Though the 
governme nt officiall y didn't ha ve a ny law against  
J ews, or s anc tions , but there were  ma ny t ypes o f  
things I remember from th
e st ories t hat I hear d, 
the fa mi ly t ell and fr om other peopl e, a nd from 
history.  That I know that
 the  Je wi sh  p e opl e wer e ,  we  
were  on t he _____________. 
Q: Did you know a bout,
 or did your  fa mil y talk about, wh
at wa s happe ni ng in Ger ma ny pri or to  
1939?  Did you know
 who Hitler was? 
A: At the time?  No.  I didn't know
 much of politics, ye
s.  I was like I said a creati ve child.  I wa s 
more interested in writing and in
 pla ying with the ki ds
 and doing art  wor k a
nd singing, I  love d t o  
sing si nce I  was a  c hild. 
 And my mother  ta ught 
me , not j u st my  mo t h er
 but  both my pare nts  
beca use  they us ed to ta
ke me to the theater, 
ma ny s ongs and t hi ngs . 
Q: So your fa mil y di dn't t alk about  wh
at was happening in 
neighbori ng Ger m any?  
A: Maybe they talked but 
I don't remember this in 
partic ular .  That didn't , you know, li ke I  sai d, I  
wa s onl y 13 years old when t he war broke out.  An
d a not her  thing whe n I was a chil d, here a 1 3  
year old c hil d knows a l ot about 
her body, knows , you know?   Beca
use I wa sn't br ought up i n the  
envir onme nt  and my gra ndmother was so orthod
ox, so it wa s more modest and you didn't kno w  
mu ch about sex, you know?  An d we
 didn't talk too much about those things at that time.  And I 
remember that in our cit y ther e 
was a girl, her na me was Rosa L
ober t a ( ph) a nd s he wa s a lea der  
fr om __________ _________
__.  And beca use  some of my fri e

there, to tell you the trut

 I didn't understa nd yet e xactl y the, I  
didn't know t oo muc h about politi cs to
 be very honest wit h you.  So I wante d to belong t oo.  And i n  
Pol and ever ybody bel ongs to orthod

her, "Rosa, I wo uld like to belong

this was about a year 
before the Nazis came  
in.  And she sai d, " Yit -cola  (p

_____ because it starts from 
______________."  And 
when __________
_ ca me I no l onger  could do 
it.  And later,
 I  don't know 
if you know abou
t Rosa  Loberta  (ph) , she wa s . . . 
Q: Di d sh e i mp r es s

A: Yes.  Sh e was a very happy

ever ybody tol d me a 
tremendous leader. 
Ver y, very much for Isr ael.  Sh

ist a nd s he was hopi ng that, very  
mu ch involved.  You know, the olde
r childr en, bec ause I was ______
___ a n d I thi nk be c ause of my 
grandmot her  I didn't, I was more in
 the religious influence, but I 
also was lucky because I had all  
other i n fl uence from my pare nts 
who took me  to the the

 Wa rsaw, because I  
had cousi ns there , I had ________

___________, s o  we w

And I re me mber li ke t oda y, I use d
 to be  so happy to
 go  wit h  my  mo ther
 and she was ver y  
affecti onat e, she wa s ver y war m.  And I re me mber
, I ' m not a thinker, but my mot her , which als o  

made a great infl uen
ce, that she instilled in me
 a love for literature and fo
r singing and 
everything.  
Is that when we li ve d in Pol and, we didn't ha ve cl osets like we  have
 now.  We ha d wha t  they calle d 
a Fre nch a m our ' ( ph) a nd it was a woode n che st t hat 
reached al most fr om the 
floor to the ceiling and 
it had t w o doors .  Facing the chest, t h e right- ha nd 
side wa s wi d e r, it was u s
ed for the wardrobe, and 
the left side was for linen and the very highest it
 had hat s of my gra ndm
o t her 's and my mother 's , 
hats lying there.  And fo
r some reason, when I was younger, th
is was still a pre-schooler, this wa s 
always  loc k ed, this  si de  of t he war d robe .  And 
I  couldn't underst and why, 
I  was so curious and I

use d to try t o play all ki nds of ga me s to try to gu

  And I us ed to thi nk, 
ma ybe a  trea sure , ma yb
e a skelet on, I even used to
 went so far as to thin
k t hat maybe I am adopt ed  
and they don't want me  to know th
at I am adopted and they are hidi
ng the papers.  
It wa s a wh ole 
sour ce of curiosit y for me.  And 
I re me mb er one  day my  mot her sa
i d, "Yi t -cola ( ph) , pleas e come .  
Co me  here.  I wa nt to show you 
some t hing."  She t ook 
out the key and s he ope ne
d the chest.  An d I 
had li ke t wo kinds of e motions .  In  one  wa y, I wa s bur ning with curios
ity to see what 
is in the chest 
that was constantl y c l os e d.  And on
 t he other hand, I was  fri g htened, 
what  I 'm going t o  find t here? 
What is t her e?   And s he ope ne d the c hest a nd s he  
said, " L ook Yit-c ola (ph)."  And it was a whol e 
chest full of books, all l eather -bound books .  And 
she took out a book, poi nt
ed t o the closet , she 
said, "Yit-cola (ph), when 
you will learn how to read, 
you will be with the gr

 a book, she 
took me on her knee, 
and she started to  
read.  And t his be ca me a daily rit ual  to which 
I l ooked for wa r d.  And I 
wa s quit e  young whe n I  
kne w a lot  of Yi ddi sh l i t e ratur e  a nd Yiddis h plays 
and poetr y because my mo
ther never read to me  
little children's stories, sh
e started with this grown 
up stuff.  And one story that I wanted to relate, 
which was written by 
_______________ __
____________, a Yiddis
h writer, it was calle d 
_____________ ____
_________, Bunc ho
s (ph) of the Sile nt .  I re me
mber ma ny stor ies, but thi s  
story I ' m rel ating t o you because I 've been t hinki
ng about i t mo st of th
e ti me when I was in 
Ausc hwitz.  And the stor y is ab
out a young chil d, about a ma nactually who was c alle d Bunc ho s  
(ph), ___________ ____
_______ which means silent. 
 And this ma n, when he 
was a little child, lost 
his mot her a nd beca me a n orpha n, only ha d his fa th
er.  At the age of 13, 
t he father remar ried and  
took a very cruel woman who abus
ed the little boy.  She 
would eat well but she 
would starve him.  
She ma de hi m c hop wood bare foot i n the winter. 
 He ne ver had a ne w c han
ge of clothes.  Th ey 
didn't send him to school.  Didn't ha
ve a friend.  But no matter what
 she , he was co
nstantly lonely, 
but he never  complai ne d , not e ven to his fa ther . 
 And one ti me, in the mi ddle of t he winter, i n a 
drunke n st upor, his fat her  thre w hi m out in t he middle of t he ni ght , 
dra gged hi m out by t he ha ir.  He  
picked hi mself up and he
 left and he was goi ng 
from pl ace to place.  He 
wandered into a big cit y  
and for  no r e ason known to hi m he
 was put in jail.  An
d t hen he was, for t h
e sa me  unknown r eas on 
to hi m, he was let  go.  But he 
was still silent. 
 Ne ver c o mplai ned.  Then 
t he st or y rel a tes how he  
suffer ed als o , sta r vati on, looking 
for j ob, a
nd wor se than the  j ob 
was looking for th
e job, and then 
people woul dn't pa y hi m.  He wa
s consta ntly a bused but Buncho ( ph) wa s  alwa ys sil ent.  And t hen  
he marrie d a woma n who already ha
d a child.  And it was a 
lit tl e boy, a baby.  An
d she l e ft hi m with 
the child and he raised the child, 
when the boy was 15 y
ears old, he threw him 
out from the house. 
But  Buncho (ph)  was aga i n sil ent .  
And it r elate s t h e whole stor y, a bea uti
ful  stor y.  It  ke pt me  so i n  
sus pense .  I re me mber it  toda y.  Act ually when I  
learne d to r ead Yiddis h, whi ch I le ar ned t o rea d  
well , I r ead ma ny of t he books whic
h my mother  had i n t hat chest . 
 And t h e reas on why she kept i t 
locked is because I was the oldest child and she wa
s afraid that the little ch
ildren might damage her 
books .  Late r, whe n we wer e ol der, t he chest wa s  
ope n whe n we le arned t o res pect it .  But i t s just  

the val ues that she had.  So thi s
 man wa s constantly abused and la
ter some body run hi m over wi th a 
horse and wagon.  And even in 
the hospital where peop
le are allowed to co
mplain, he was still 
silent .  And in silence he lived and in silence he 
died.  And aft er he was buried they put  a piece o f  
wood and a mar ker on his

mar ker and the gr avedi gger 's wi fe 
found it and used it to light the, to

then, but it  wa s di ffere nt, the write
r  says , i n t he other  worl d, the worl
d where t her e is justi ce.  And 
when he c a me up, t hey told hi m, 
" B unc ho ( ph), here i n heaven e ver yt
hi ng is yours .  Whate ver you 
wa nt.  Pi ck, choose ."  And he c ouldn't belie ve it.
  Why woul d s o mebody be

other  worl d where t he y wer e s o cr ue l to hi m her
e ?   And yet, Bunc ho ( ph)  
didn't comp lain.  Not to 
ma n, not to God, never, he was en
vi ous that somebody had more.  
So fi nally t hey sa id, " Buncho 
(ph) , wha t  would you like? "  And 
he c oul dn't  belie ve it .  And 
fi nall y he sai d, " We ll, your  
Exc elle ncy, all I would li ke is ever y morni ng for br
eakfast a hot roll with butter."  And when I was,  
later during the Nazis, I was thin
king ver y much about t his  st ory 
because I reali
zed why he  was  
silent .  He had no choice.  And al
so, what would we give
 for a piece of br ead.  So t he l iteratur e, and  
also a not her  thing which I ofte n thi n k about thi s st
ory, is that  Paris ( ph)
 wh o was a g r eat Yi ddi sh  
write r, that he wr ote a bout one ma n a n d this has be
come a Yi ddish cla ssic .  
Thi s book i s  in Englis h 
still and its beautiful.  I di
dn't go into all the deta
ils because it woul
d be too l
ong, but the basic thing 
is, the cr uelt y.  And whe n he says he re that the y 
look, why was he sile nt?   He didn't have to be  
silent , he shoul d ha ve cr ied out.  But  when t he Nazi
s ca me in, I realized that I became like Bunch o  
(ph) t he Sil e nt.  When Ger many 
inva ded Pol and, the first t hing of
 the hometown, the first thing I 
remember, because 
at t h at ti me we l i ved i n the other ho
use already.  And ou
r house was strict 
_____________, whi ch wa s 
near Warsaw Street , whi c
h wa s the mai n str e et. 
 An d a s  soo n  as we  
came out, this was almost in th
e c orner, was a la r ge hous e and the y ha d a  cellar, t he y had li ke bi g 
cellars .  So when t he air raids wa s,
 we we nt to hiding, int o hi di ng.  
And e ve n ther e, sit ting ther e, my  
mother tried to calm us down with 
telling us stories.  She was such
 a wonde rful story-te l l er and she  
knew so much literature a
nd so many plays.  And th
en, when they just ca
me in, we were still 
allowed to move from 
place to place, so people started t o ru
n.  People fro
m Warsaw came to small  
towns .  Other pe ople ca me t o di ffer ent pl ace s.  
And my fat her 's entire fa
mi l y, his si sters, thr ee  
sisters , one natural si ster and t wo hal f-sister s, be ca use hi s fa the r  died whe n he was a young boy, and 
my father was born in Pull-tos (p
h), Poland.  So they still lived wi
th the children and, I think, their 
nieces and nephews, they lived in
 Pull-tos ( ph) .  And we di dn't 
know what's happ
ened to them 
because, so my fat her was going 
t o go, I r e me mber t oda y t h e conv
ersati on bet we en my parents, he  
said, " Let 's go to Pull-t os (ph) .  My sisters ar e 
gone ."  Be cause bot h parent s, like , I never  kne w my 
grandparents on my father's side, so
 he held the responsibilities being th
e oldest child, to take care of 
the m.  But we didn't know, we di dn
't go.  And the n, when t he y  to
ok War sa w, we could no l onger go 
fr om place t o place.  That 's when t he Na
z i s be gun their syste m atic destr ucti on. 

Q: Did th e Ger ma ns c o me i nto y our  town?   We r e  
there bombings?  Did the sol dier s actuall y co me 
in? 

A: The soldiers came in.  
There was bombi ng.  And, I  
just t old you, we we nt 
int o hi di ng.  And t hen 
when t he bombi ng s t opped, I 'll tell
 you what my gra nd m other di d. 
 It's almost ironic.  My 
grandmot her  lived thr ough Wor l d Wa r One, s o sh
e reme mbered a di fferen
t kind of Ger ma n y. 
Because she remembered a Ger m
any not at war against civilia
n people, women 
and children  
especiall y targets, and Jewish peop
le.  So she baked a ca
ke and s h
e said, " Yit-c ola  (ph) , ta ke it  out  
to the poor soldiers that are 
away from ho me ."  She was a ve
ry c o mpa ss i onat e  woma n.  She ha d 
not hing to do wit h politi cal _____
____, and she a ske d me to bring it ou
t.  So later wh
en they, I thi nk 
it was towards the end of, th
ey came i n Oct obe
r, I mean September 1, 193
9.  At t hat  ti me  was  about  
3,300,000 J e ws  in Pola n
d.  Ninety- p ercent  have  peris he d.  And 
most  of t hos e, the  te n per cent  who 
survived, mostly surviv
ed in the USSR  Because there 
were no ghett os .  There was n o  
concentr ation, no gas c h a mber s, you know, c onc en
trati on ca mps wi th ga s 
chambers.  They also 
have suffered. 

Q: Okay, tell me your story. 

A: So, anyhow.  Wh en the 
Nazis came in to the other cities, th
at was the last ti
me that I saw my 
relatives.  All the other relatives 
that  lived i n t he  other t o wns  beca use we  coul d no longer t r avel  
fr om pl ace to place.  They star
ted by taking up the spirit ual 
and the communit y leader s, t he

intelli gencia  (ph).  Some  Polis h pe ople too.  And they took t he m a wa y s o me, t hey s hot , the one s  
they t ook a w ay, I di dn't s ee what they did with the m
 so I can only bear wit n
ess for what I saw.  And 
they start ed to de stroy t h e Syna go
gue s, the Hol y Scri ptur es.  The y 
confiscated all ou
r  busi ne sse s. 
We  di dn't have , in Chec k-hon- off ( p
h) a busi ne s s.  M y fat he r  wa s, 
li ke I  said, I t old you be fore . 
And they started to put on curfews.
  We wer e not  allowed to c ongregate in large gr oups .  I could n o  
longer, we c oul d no l onger go to s chool , all sc hools 
were cl osed.  All social Temples wer e closed. 
We  ha d t o wea r  a yellow st ar.  We
 wer e not all owed t o wal k on the pa ve ment , just i n the  stre et.  
And we had to gi ve up, ever yda y when we 're t o ld 
this is the worst, some
thing worst happened . 
Eve r yday t h ey ma de ne w la ws .  And we were not 
allowed a ny longer to obs erve t he  Jewish l a ws  
beca use  they burne d, not ope nly, 
they had to do 
it  i n hidi ng. 
Q: How soon did this ha
ppe n a fter  they ca me  in?  
A: Well t he bur nings, the y sta rted to bur n books . 
 I tol d you, my mot her  
value d s o mu ch book and 
its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Hol
y, all the books that w a s 
fr om the Yi -shiv-as (ph) and a
ll t he books from the Synagogue, 
i n t he Syna gogue, t hey bur ne d 
down everyt hing.  So t h ey st arte
d to just destruction right awa
y, and c u rfe w s, and we were not  
allowed to congregate in larg
e groups, you know, for religiou
s pe ople, t o go for ___________, 
whi c h is you ha ve to ha ve 10 pe
opl e to ha ve for the pra yer s .  So al l those thi ngs we re, act uall y 
religious people suffered the most
.  They s t arte d t o, wh
en t hey saw elder l y me
n, most of t he pe ople, 
my fathe r  di dn't ha ve a beard, he was clean- shave n,
 but s o many other pe ople
 did.  So they laughed, 
they start ed to pull out t he bear d or t hey woul d shav e off hal f  a beard.  They
 started to torture, to  
mock.  Be ca use t o, the y did whate v
e r  the y wa nte d.  They ha d all l egal  ri ghts  to do t hos e thi ngs. 
An d then they confiscated the busi
nes s, t hey l oote d the  merc ha ndis e. 
 They started to ration the foo d  
and starte d s t arvati on.  And al so we had t o, the y 
wo uld grab people to do th
e work i n  the st reet . 
An d a fter a wh ole d a y 's wo rk , the y 
would c o me home a nd w
oul d ha ve to stay in 
long lines to get a 
s mall rati on, a ver y s mall  ration.  So r i ght a w ay we 
starte d to s t arve .  Couldn'
t go t o sc hool .  And in  
other  __________ c ount ry t he most  
i mport ant  ri ght  is t he  ri ght  to 
pr otes t, t o s pea k up.  But  you 
coul dn't.  So that 's  whe n I was  thi nki ng a l ot abou
t st arvation, about  Bunc ho 
(ph) t he Sile nt.  That  
we ha d to be sile nt, you know, i n or der t o s urvi v
e.  And t he n  somet hi ng happe ned which e f fe cted  
me ver y much per sonall y, a nd my 
mother .  They as ked us to give
 up a ll our valuables, gol d and 
valuable s, s o  we bec o me i mpoveris he d and we ha d to
 do forced labor.  So 
one day, a nd also t here  
was a law, that the Je
wi sh pe opl e, for t he Ger ma ns  to 
associat e wit h Jewish people wa s 
____________ bec ause t hey 
si ngle d us out  as  an inferi or ra ce . 
 And we  were not  allowe d t o have  
any tra nsact i ons , not  busi ness , not  soc i al, not  se xual
, because for the 
Nazi and the Je w, if this would 
happen, it would be 
punished.  And 
we had a big __
_______ and one 
time a man, a 
civilian, until 
this day I don't know his name , 
but I reme
mb er the incident ve
ry cle arly beca us e  I was als o 
involved in it.  A man 
came in and he was selling household ar
ticles.  Since peop
le, most people  
gave up t he mone y be ca use they di dn't wa nt to ri s
k, i f t hey ar e caught for whate ver you did a gai nst  
the la w, it was punis habl e by dea t h.  And even wi th
out any re a son they s hot  and the y kill ed and the y  
tortur ed.  But anyhow, so when he 
ca me i n a lot of people , just  for curi osit y, ca me a nd l ooked.  And 
one ma n wa l ked by, hi s na me wa s Ca l -fus (ph).  He
 was t he owner of the buil ding where I we nt to 
school .  And he walke d  
by t oo and he ca me  in.  
And my mother all of a 
sudde n re a lized t hat i f  
some body is  going to se e us sta ndi ng and havi ng
 any busi ne ss transacti o
n wit h some body who is  
not Jewish, and we didn't know wh
et her he wa s Poli sh or whethe
r  he  was  Ge r man, be caus e there  
wa s a l ot of __________ __
________, t hat is  some body who is of
 German descent but
 he didn't live 
in Poland.  So she said, she was 
afr aid, so she said, " Please come
 i nto my house ."  She i nvit ed 
ever ybody.  And Cal- fus  (ph) obviously took a risk 
and he di dn't give a w ay all the mone y.  So he

bought ma ybe 90 per ce nt of the me
rcha ndi se.  My mother didn't bu
y a nyt hing.  We ga ve up the 
merchandise, you know?  Maybe he
 hid a little bit becaus
e I remember, but befo
re we came to the  
ghett o I re me mber se eing my mothe r  taking out 
fr om her corset, you know wome n were we aring 
corsets, and it was li ke a 
bone, l i ke a plasti c bone , she pul led t h
is out and s he ma de r oll s of money 
and she st uffed it i n s o t h ey c oul d hide it on t he m
, so t he y mus t  ha ve s ave d some money but ma ybe  
she didn't wa nt to s pe nd it  or what
ever .  But anyhow, t he Nazis left, I 
mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the 
people left and this man, who wa
s selling the merchandise.  But it di
dn't take long, this same man  
brought the Ge stapo int o  our hous
e a nd de nounce d my mot her .  An
d the y aske d my mother , " Who 
is the  man who brought t he mer cha ndise, bec aus e he t o

that I  heard my mother  li e.  She 
said she didn't know.  
But s he  did know who he  was .  He  was  not a

A: So, I was telling you of 
the story about, when th
is man who sold 
the household arti
cles that we 
didn't know brought the Ge stapo to 
our house and they interrogated my
 mother.  The y wa nte d her t o  
tell who Cal -fus ( ph) wa s.  And, I '
m not s ure whe t her I me ntioned t his
, that this was the first time I 
hear d my mother l ying.  That she sa
i d she di dn't know, she denie d it. 
 So aft er interr ogated for quit e 
a whil e, they saw that they cannot get out of her 
anythi ng.  The y took her a wa y.  The Gestapo took  
her a w ay.  I  wa s by t hat  ti me 13 ye ars old, a nd 
I sa w al rea d y the cr uelt y, wha t 's  goi ng on, t hey 
started many destructions, many pe
ople were already kille
d and tortured.  So 
I was afraid to be 
separ ate d fr om my mot her.  So I 
r u n a ft er her.  And I  was  deter min
ed, no matt er what 's  going t o  
happe n, I ' m not goi ng to leave her al one .  So the y
 ke pt on chasing me a w
ay.  And fi nally, one of 
the m sai d, " Take her  too."   And 
I wa s al most  happy that
 they took me too 
beca use  I t hink t hat  
whate ver ha ppe ne d, othe rwis e I won't eve n know if
 the y ta ke  her away, I  wa nt t o know what 's  

happe ned t o her.  And the y br ought
 us  to the Gest a po, the  stati o n, 
a nd the y s eparat ed us .  They t ook 
my  mot her i n to a sep a ra
te room.  Thi s, I was not 
an e ye- witne ss, I wa s an 
ear- witness.  And, what I  
hear d, it  s ounde d li ke t h ey wer e bea ting her a
nd she  was scr ea ming.  Th
e shout s got  louder and 

louder and after a while it
 wa s sile nt .  Tha t 's whe n  my he art al
most st oppe d too, beca use as l ong a s 
she was screaming, I knew
 that she's still alive.
  But when it was sile
nt, I had no
 longer any 
knowledge, whether sh
e's still alive, whether she'
s conscious.  And what 
see med to me like an 
eternit y, I ca nnot esti ma t e how l ong
 i t  took, but fi nally t he doors 
s w ung open.  Two Gestapos , ea c h 
hol ding her under t he ar mpit, dra ggi
ng her across the floor.  And t o
ok me in, to be next.  And I  
wanted to see whether my
 mother, I saw she was bl
eeding, and I wanted to 
see whether she is still  
alive.  So I  l ooked at  her , whi l e 
they took me out, took
 her  out, t hey took me  
into the same place.  
And s he didn't s ay anything, but s h
e gave me a si gn not t o sa y anyt
hi ng.  And I l
ove d my mot her  
beca use she always l ove d me so mu
c h and I kne w what kind of a pe
rson she was.  So I was, when 
they started to ask me questions I sa
id, "I don't know it."  I lied too.
  Deliber ately.  And t hey started 
to beat me a nd I was s cr ea ming, a
nd my mo t her h eard me 
s cre a m but s he didn't sa y anything.  And 
after I was beaten quite well, th
ey, because we spoke Yiddi sh at 
home , and Yi ddi sh is si milar t o  
Ger ma n , they unde rstood, that t he y sai d, " Gi n
-nook (ph) ".  Enough
.  _______ _________  
_________ _______
__, whi ch me ans  ma ybe we don™t know. 
 Maybe _______ we don't  know.  An d 
that 's whe n t hey r elea sed us.  Thi s st ory beg
un i n  1939, shortl y a fter Ge
r ma ny i nvade d Pola nd.  I  
didn't see anymore  Cal- fus ( ph) .  I di
dn't know what's happen
ed to hi m.  At that ti me, t he Nazi s use d  
all kinds of techniques.  Th
ey reversed, you see,
 Hitler's laws were a reversal
 of all the Jewish laws. 
 
We , in Judaism, in home  
and i n He br ew sc hool, t hey
 ta ught us that we  ar
e all responsi ble for one 
anot her .  What they did is that i f one pers on 
did somet hing wr ong, t hey 
punished us all.  Group  
punishme nt  for i ndi vidual  acti on.  
So, and ironical l y, what  was legall
y our s t hey took 
away by  force 
and we were  punis hed for trying t o
 keep it or t o have 
it.  So I didn't know 
what 's ha ppe ne d to t h e  
Cal-fus (ph) family 
but wh at we knew, both my mo ther and I,
 is that if we w
oul d have t old the y 
would have killed the whole fa mily
, not just the father. 
 And I'm going to stop 
here because I don't 
want to lose the end of this st
or y beca use thi s stor y had a tre m endous i mpa ct on me.  And I 'm goi n g  
to skip and come back later to 
1939.  I ' m goi ng now to 
1981 when I we nt to th

Je wish Hol o caust  survi v ors, oka y?  

Q: Okay.

when we came t her e, each

Mena chem Bacon was the President there.  And I 
was over whel med with em

t o  the gate s of  Jerusale m a nd a f

nd t he n I underst o od al rea dy what it me a ns t o ha ve our homela nd, 
then people  cannot tell  you, "The  houses ar

are our s."  And I wa s  
over w hel me d.  And I  wa s so eager t o
 go t o mar c h, and t hat ma rch a s

but t he y a sked me  not t o beca use  they nee de d me  t o

"Ca n I  ha ve  a mar ker  or  a pen? "  And I  wrot e on

 in case s o me body re cogniz e d, y

Wh o will know me?  And as I st
and t here, Kent el Vee-che-nya 
(ph) from Lindst rom, Pe nns ylvania  
(ph) was bri ngi ng t he Ameri ca n fla g  
as a gi ft to Mena chem Bacon.  
And he looked at
 my badge, he 
said, " Y ou'r e from Chai r-h

wal ke d a not her ma n and he sai d, " I 'm from Cha i r-h

I said, " Who are you? " 
And he sai d, "Cal- hus (ph)."  And 
I we nt be rser k.  I starte d to cry and to l augh and I wa s so e xcit e d

t o be t h e fat her .  He  said, "I 'm Cal-hus 's (ph)

they took away from us all our fr eedo m,  they

Q: Were  you abl e t o tr y t o obs erve  holidays a nd t h ings  li ke t hat ?

A: We  couldn't observe holidays anym
ore because, fir st of 
all, Jews were not al
l o wed ofte n t o pr ay  
or t o go a mong the Synagogues. 
 We couldn't make a traditional sha-
but (ph), there 
wa s no food. 
We  lived in constant fe ar
.  And I saw, for instance, I think that
 I me ntione d it , th
e religious people 
suffer ed mor e because th
ey coul dn't ofte n _____________ and th
ere wa s st arvati on.  When you, we  
tried as much as we could.  I still 
knew what day it is an
d we tried as much as 
we could to keep the 
sha- but  (ph), but  that wa s  whe n we were sti ll li ving
 in Chai r-hon- off ( ph) .  An
d I  act uall y di dn't say  
good- bye to any of my re lative s. 
 Only, fr om all the fa mily, fr om all the member s, the onl y pe rson 
on my  mo th er 's  sid e  t hat I sai d 
good-bye was to my  grandmother. 
 Be cau s e  my  mot h
er  and I was at  
her bed si de when she di
ed.  And she  was c l ear , her mind wa s so
 cl ear .  And I r e me
mb e r  that  I wa s  
terribl y upse t and my mother sai d 
somet hing that  also was to be a 
less on.  She sai d, " Yit-c ola (ph) , 
(she said that in Yi ddi sh, of cour se, because as I 
said I spoke Yiddish), deat
h teaches us not to t ake 
for granted life ."  And we still 
had, usually you know
, according to tradition, 
the Jewish burial was  
very i mportant.  But later we co
uldn't have, people couldn't ultima
tely go and bury so we still, she  
wa s sti ll buri ed i n Chair- hon- off ( ph) . 
Q: You were  abl e t o bur y her properl y ? 

A: We di d, we were a bl e  to bur y 
her properly but it was not like a 
big funeral that s he would have  
had because the chil dren fr om Wa
rs a w, t he childr en from __________ 
a nd all of t he m, they c oul dn't  
come .  We j ust, our fa mily, a nd 
the people who wer e invol ved.  
Beca us e from e ver ythi ng, fro m  
birth to deat h, our live s wa s di ffer
ent than it is now, how it was duri
ng the Hol oc aust .  Bec ause, for  
insta nce , the r e wa s not funer al pyr es .  There was not
, you didn't bury people the s a me  way that is  
here .  And e veryt hing was di ffere
nt, on t he wa y t he c ust oms wer e do
ne.  Our whole li ves cha nged .  
Be fore the Nazis came in, the longe st that I ever 
didn't eat was fr om one me
al t o the other .  And  
being that we have a kosher home
 and familiar, after 
meat, eating, you wait 
six hours.  So the 
religion taught me a lot of
 discipline too.  And la
ter t he people who ke pt kosher c ould not kee p  
kos her , t he y didn't  ha ve  food at  al
l.  They were starving.  So  then
 in the middle of
 t he  ni ght  . . . 
Q: Di d you break thos
e rules?  Did you eat whatev
er you c oul d at that poi nt?  
A: At t hat point t here was no meat
.  The r e was no meat a nd we tri e d 
as much to keep as we coul d. 
But  event ual ly when the hunger  to
ol over you no longer
 could do it anymore 
because I remember a  
young pupil onc e of a Ra bbi , whe n I 
wa s in Cha i r - hon-off ( ph) .  Some
body was sick so he sai d tha t  
you're all o wed, you don't have to fa
st if you don't feel good becaus
e t o preser ve your  health, that 
was the first obligation.  So all th
e laws, all the rules that applied 
be fore into othe
r times that no  
longer could be applied he
re.  Be cause here was ju
st one thing,
 survival. 
Q: How long were you able to
 li ve i
n your  own home?  
A: This is where I'm coming to 
no w.   I  re me mb er exa c
tly.  It was in the mi
ddl e of the night. 
Oct ober 15, 1941.  We were a slee p
 a n d we he ard, t hey br oke in, th
e mi ddle of the night.  "All you-
den r ouse."  All J e ws out .  And at tha t  poi nt we only, we coul dn
't, you wa ke up and you ar e tire d, 
oh, the first thing with my
 mot her , gr ab what she wa
s mostly interested of c
ourse, the family should 
get out ali ve .  She took t he ca ndl estic ks, books, 
her books.  A fe
w books and a coupl e  of bundles  
beca use  e ver ybody was  c onst antl y ha
ving, l i ke  a few thi ngs, we di dn't
 know fr om day 
to day.  And 
we didn't know, where ar e the y taki
ng us?   And when I wa
s a child, we us e to, I 
use t o play a lot at , 
you know they ha ve, ________ it was  called, a river.  I '
m tr ying to, is this a  river or a lake?   Whi c h 
is larger?  A lake?  A river.
  A lake  is larger , I think, but this wa
s a ri ver .  And in th
i s river, we used 
to play a s childre n, I us e to go, a nd there were big 
trees .  In fa ct, I re me mber a stor y whe n I talk 
about the river and, I don't know, 
should I tell it?  Wh ich is reall
y, okay.  But a nyhow, s i nce pe opl e  
in this river , people used to bat he and there wa
s like a special , li ke a place 
where on sha- but ( ph) we  
use d t o go, ___________ 
they use to call it, you know, to go 
for a  wal k.  And we would go to the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

river .  And had be auti ful mome nts .
  And then was a bi g cast le near 
the river, there was a castle. 
Wh en I lived there, it was empty, nobo
dy lived in there.  Bu
t a beautiful castle.  
In fact, I was now in 
Poland, it's still there, the castle is
 still there.  I have 
a photograph of it.  S
o, in the middle of the  
night, " All you- den rouse ."  Wit h do
gs, ri fl es, and they chased us ou
t a nd t h ey took us
 to the castle 
near t he ri ve r.  Lee- din- ya (ph) was c alled t he ri ve r.
  And fr om there they pu
t us on trucks and they 
took us to the ghetto
, No ve' Mesto, Poland. 
Q: Now who was with you at this plac
e?   Your e nti re i m me diate  fa mil y?  
A: My parents, my little brother an
d my little sister.  That was all.
  My Aunt and 
Uncle and their 
childr en, the y wer e the only ones that  I saw still 
in the begi nni ng, but whe n  they cha se d  us out the y  
wer e not wit h us .  So li ke  I said, the only pers on t h
at I said good-bye was my
 grandmother.  The rest 
of the fa mil y  we  di dn't 
know be cause t o the ot her 
ci ties we coul dn't even go
, but  the m we  woul d s ee  
occasionall y.  But when t h
ey chased us out, not un
til after the war I 
found out that wh
en t hey chased 
us out they didn't chase 
out the wh ole city, they 
just chased out part.  
I don't know whether it wa s 
the larger or the smaller 
but  the rest  they chased out  later, 
s o  my  A u n t  mu st 
have been, a nd he r  
fa mily with them. 
Q: Di d you have  any sens e of wh
y you were  chose n  to go at  th
at poi nt vers es anot her  fa mi ly?  
A: I didn't even know that we were, that some bo
dy was le ft .  Beca use t h ey cha se d us out in the 
mi ddle of the night.  We  
didn't have a cha nce t o t alk to anybo
dy.  Not unti l aft er the war did I fi nd  

this out. 

Q: So t he y s ent you t o t h is ot her  town? 

A: They se nt us  to ot her town whic h wa s cal led 
No ve' Mesto, they change
d t he na me s, e ver ythi ng 
wa s ch an ged .  An d No ve ' 
Mest o, wher e pre viousl y lived one fa mil
y, they put in six,
 se ven a nd eight  
fa mi lies .  And t he ghett o, you know, I don't have
 t o expla i n to you what
 a ghet t o is, we wer e  
isolat ed fr om t he whole city.  A
nd it  was so te rri bly cr owded.  A
nd t here ,  where we li ved i n was a  
fa mily, the family which 
lived there was called Yat
-rack (ph), and when we 
came there the fa cilities  
were not much better, like
 in ours.  And so many 
families with little childr
en, and every
body wanted  
to be abl e to go to the st ove or use t he faciliti
es and e ver ythi ng.  So, it 
was already horribl e just  
being s o c r owded.  And one  ti me , 
my mot her  and fat her sai d  to us
, "Kindle-left  (p
h) childr en, get  
toget her  the  fe w be longi ngs , we  are  
leaving."  And I thought to myself, ar e they loosing, ha ve they 

lost t heir  mi nds?  Wher e are we le
a vi ng?   It 's a  ghetto.  We c ann
ot go out .  But we
 were, kne w to 
respe ct our pare nts so we obeye d.  And we  went to
 a place where was before
 a stor age for grains.  
And it was e mpty, it wa s  a dirt fl oor and nothing th
ere , just a s mall wi ndow and a door.  And my 
pare nts we nt , there we re ma ny r uins 
a nd they got t oget her s o me bric
ks and by the msel v es the y built 
a little stove.  But what they said is
 still clear and vivid in
 my mind.  They said
, "At least here we'll
 
have, it 's  e nough t hat t he  Naz i s dest
roy us fr om the outside.  Here at
 least we'll have 
a little bit more 
peace and we'll be toget h er
.  But  it won't be beca us e the fi ght ing, 
t he screami ng, the chi ldren cryi ng.  
So we'll live there, right 
here , in thi s stora ge r o
om."  Exactly, and t he co
nditions of the ghetto, I 
don't  thi nk I nee d t o go
 in be cause i t s very 
clear at this point. 
Q: Well  how ba d wa s it?
  I mean, there are ma
ny ki nds  of ghett o s. 
A: Okay.  This ghett o, t o  my 
knowle dge , was not  like t he Wa rsa w 
ghett o where t here was physi cal  
resista nce , of fighting.  In fa ct
, ther e was s o me  ghetto, it wa s not
 as large a ghet to.  What I  
remember is that we were
 constantly hungry
.  And my mother tried fr om
 the little meal that we had, 
she tried to make m
eals and many times what she 
did, she woul
d take a little of he
rs, she would give 
to the smaller children becau
s e  the y c oul dn't endur e so muc h.  We
 wa nte d t he par e nt s, i f  the pare nts  
wanted to protect the children, sh
e still was trying to read poetry 
and to sing songs, she still had the 
books , a nd s he s ays , " We must , a s l o ng as we  live,
 we must  go on like  a cloc
k.  We c annot st op. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
17 
 
 
We have to go on."  And she triedto teach my li tt le sister who didn
't have a chance 
to go to school , 
so s he tri es t o tea ch her a t  home
, _________ a nd to write a lit tle bi
t .  And my br other never had a 
chance t o become bar mit zvah.  I  do
n't know the exact age 
of them but I know th
at before, that  he  
wa s not yet bar mitz va h.  And ba r mit zva h was al wa
ys a very, ver y i mpor t ant thi ng for a Je wis h  
child.  So we lived in co
nstant , a nd there wa s a  lot  of sickne sse s.
  Because t he sanit ary, t here was no  
medication, there wa
sn't a sanitary.  A lot of 
parents died.  You 
saw little orphaned children in the 
street beggi ng for food.  It was just horribl e.  
Why I don't go in so muc h
 detail fro m the ghetto, 
because remember like I sa
id be fore , that each ti me we thought
 it's the worst, something worse  
came.  So after Auschwitz,
 this was like paradise
.  And for the main reas
on, because I still had my  
fa mi ly. 
Q: Okay, but then
 let me  ask you 
a fe w questi ons . 
A: Okay. 

Q: Bec a us e we know a l ot more a b
out some of the larger
 ghettos, but I don't 
know too muc h about  
this one.  Was ther e an organi zat
i on wit hin it?   Wa s there a yudde
n-rot (ph)?  Where there Jewi sh 
polic e men?   Or  di d t he Ger mans patrol the  ghett o?  

A: The Germans patrolled, I don't 
know wh y I don't have so mu ch 
knowl edge of how it was in t h e 
ghett o.  Bec ause I know one thi ng, 
that most of the time we stayed
 insi de so muc h.  I know t here  
wa s a  lot  of sickness.  I kn
ow t hat  the y trie d t o hel p, t her e wer e  
pe opl e who tried t o hel p each ot her .  
But the problem is that everybody 
was star ved.  Eve r ybody wa s hungr
y.  You couldn't go, it 's j u st 
that someti mes the parents 
like made sacrifices.  Th
ey would give a 
little of their ration to a younger 
child a nd the starvati on.  The ki ds couldn't anymor
e go t o sc hool.  But if they woul d disc ove r that  

we tea ch the childr en, we c oul d be  shot .  The y  didn't want  us to be e d ucate d.  The y wa nte d t o  

destr oy ever ythi ng else.  So stil l, the parents tried 
to teach and there were gr
oups and we tried, li ke 
there was a group and if somebody got
 sick they tried to help.  But 
the exact conditions that I should  
reme mb er so clearly, I don't reme mb
er.  I didn't know, I wa s too yo
ung still to kn
ow everything. 
Q: So you di dn't know how i t wa s organize d or run? 
A: No. 
Q: Was  ther e a  soup kit c hen?
  Do you re me mber that?  
A: I don't.  No, I don't. 

Q: It 's oka y.  I f you don't  
mi nd, ask you a fe w questions. 
A: No, no, you c an as k me.  But I 
don't know.  I know that , yea h, 
there  mu st have bee n a sou p  
kitchen because I re member t hat  we 
used to go to get some
 food, bec ause we di dn
't ha ve  the  food at  
home .  We  got rat i ons. 
 But I don't reme mb er ex
a ctly how it was orga niz ed. 
Q: Di d pe opl e wor k i n t he  ghetto
?  Did either of your parents,
 were t hey forced t o work?  
A: I don™t t hi nk too much, no. 

Q: Okay.  Di d you play
 with othe r c hil dren?  
A: Ye s.  In fact, t here  wa s 
one girl that I got to know
 i n the ghet to.  We stayed
 frie nds.  So ye s, I di d 
have friends, tried to as 
much as  we  coul d t o go 
on and t o t al k, but t he cond
iti ons wer e s o horri ble .  
Because hunger and no place to wash, no pl ace to, if
 somebody got sick th
ere was no medicat i on. 
So there was a l ot of 
ill ne
sses , li ke typhus  was  a l ot , al so, goi
ng in.  Some  pe ople  di ed of starvation.  
Some people die
d, that's what I reme
mber most, is little kids crying
 a lot and begg
ing.  And older  
people sitting outside 
because there is alread
y a lot of orphans. 
Q: Werebodies burie
d when people died? 
A: This I don't know. 

Q: Di d you, wer e  you a bl e
 to s ort of, you wer e, wa
s t he ghetto fenced in?  
We re you able to go out  
of it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
18 
 
 
A: Yes.  Yes, it was fe nced in. 
Q: But you c oul d wa nder fre ely 
on t he  stre ets 
in the ghetto?  
A: In the ghetto, people tried 
not  to wa nde r ar ound t oo muc h beca
use they didn't wa nt to, t he y  
wa nte d to avoid to be vis i ble.  Not to get hit be
cause the Nazis had a tenden
cy to torture, to mock 
us.  I n fact , for tha t  reas on, we tr
ie d as muc h to stay out of s i ght
.  I re me mber that I wa s mostl y  
trying to be inside, like 
I felt safer to be inside. 
Q: Did th e Naz i s co me in
to the ghetto?  Do youremember  seeing people 
in uniform inside the 
ghett o?  

A: Yes.  But not constant
ly.  I don't know wh
y I have so little reco
llection of the ghet
to.  That is not 
too muc h, I  wa s a whole  year  in t h
e ghett o.  It was e xactl y October 
15, 1941.  They c hase d us fr om 
home .  And the ghett o, t he e ntire gh
etto was liquidated on Nove mber 
17, 1942.  About 
a year later . 
What I  remember i s that 
when, agai n in t he mi ddle of the ni gh
t, I don't know wh
y, but wh en we 
wer e chased off it was i n the mi ddl
e of the night.  But this time 
we were tol d, the y got us all  
together, and we were told
 that we're going to be 
resettled to a fa mi
ly camp  where we
 are going to 
have better conditions.  Wh ere we 
are going to have fo
od and medications an
d where the fa milies  
are going to be toget her a nd work
.  And people were happy t h at we
'r e going to ha ve bet t er medi cal 
conditions and better food.  
And then they took us a
ll and they put us in the 
cattle cars.  I still had . . 
. 

Q: How did you get t his  i n for ma tion?  

A: Fr om t he  __________ b
eca use  I we nt t here  too. 
Q: No, how did you get  th
e info rmation that you were going 
to be moved suppose d ly to the se  
fa mi ly  ca mp s?  

A: Because a Nazi  say t h is. 

Q: So they came and they told you that? 

A: They told us that
 we are going to be resettle
d to a family camp
 and we are going 
to have better 
conditions.  We 're going to
 have medicine
, because a lot of pe
ople died because th
ey got sick, they 
didn't have a ny me dicati o n.  And t hat we 're going t o 
ha ve more  food, that we
're going to have good  
conditions.  We 're goi ng to work but we 're goin
g to have good conditi on
s.  And it ma de se ns e 
beca use  the y  wa nt us we ll, that 's 
wha t  we  thought .  So t he y ar e goi
ng to feed us 
better, they a r e 
goi ng t o gi ve us me dicat ion, and we didn't put a n y 
resi stance beca use we didn't know.  We beli eve d  
it.  I wa s brought up t o tr ust pe opl e, t o belie ve .  Y
ou know, in my li fe, my fa mi ly di dn't  ever bet r ay  
me .  Lik e  I said , th e o nl y ti me I  he a r d my  mot h
er lyi ng i s t his, so I had no r eas on why not t o  
belie ve. 

Q: Let me  as k you one qu
estion.  Di d your fa mil y t a
lk about what was happen
ing or you j ust got by  
day to day?  

A: I didn™t hear much discussion
, I don't know whether my  parents wa
nted to shield 
us.  Believe it 
or not, in the worst cond
itions, they were tellin
g us stories, they we
re teaching 
us . . .  
[e nd of si de  1 of ta pe  2] 

Q: So you and your fa
mily
 were put on cattle cars?  
A: Yes .  

Q: Tel l  me  a bout t h
e trip, the journey. 
A: Oh that was a ti
me I will never forget.  They
 closed, they closed, we we
re put in the cattle cars, 
they pushed in, it was so tight th
at you hardl y had place to sit down.  Ther e was nothi n g to sit on. 
And t here was no place t o reli eve 
yoursel f.  They locked
 us in with just a 
small window that you  
looked out, and they locked us, y
ou know, her m etically sealed cattle
 trains.  And wh
en the journey

begun, t here wa s s o ma ny pe ople  pa ck
ed in this here, and we traveled 
with this here, the train, fr o m 
Nove mber  17, 1942
, whe n we  arri ved  in Au sc h wit z was  No ve
mber 22, 1942.  So fi ve  days, right?  
Q: Wh at wa s ha pp en
ing in the cars?  
A: Wh at was happening in the cars
?   It wa s hot .  We were hungr y.  
We were thirsty.  People were 
crying.  Pe ople were pra ying.  Pe
ople were screaming, 
going crazy.  We had no
 choice , we ha d to 
relieve our se lves in fr ont  of other pe ople .  Star va
tion.  Fear .  Where ar e we goi ng?  How l ong are  
we going to go?   Whe r e they ar e taki ng us?   The y
 promi sed better c ondit ions , whe n is it going t o  
be?   And I r e me mbe r  pa rents trie d to comfort , when
 we arri ve there thi ngs are goi ng t o get bet t er.  
And in the meantime, people were
 fainting.  People 
got  sic k.  It  wa s j ust a li ving Hell. 
Q: As a yo u ng g i rl d o y ou re me mbe r  wh at wa
s goi ng on i n your mind, wh
at you were thi nki ng  
about? 
A: What wa s going 
on, I wa s cli ngi ng t o my parent s.  
And I was wondering, what 's goi ng t o  
happen?  And I was crying
 because I saw my 
little brother and sister so 
hungry and I had nothing to 
give t he m.  The pare nts wa nte d to pr otect us, we  
want t o pr otect the pare nts.  And we sa w older  

people , we wer e  al wa ys  told by my pare nts a nd my
 gra ndmo t her, may she rest i n pe a ce, t hat we  
always help thos e who a r e less fortunate but here 
we were all less fortunat
e.  And t he worst thi ng 
was that we coul dn't help each 
other t oo much.  We we
re all in the same 
condition.  There was no 
relie f, no reli ef.  And j ust , I kept
 on thinki ng about , I wa nt
ed to turn my mind of
f so I was trying to 
think of st ori es but t he hunger t ook
 over.  We were sleep
y, ther e wa s no pla ce to lay down.  It wa s  
the most horrible journey.  It wa
s a horribl e journey.  And the n, a ft e
r five days like t hi s, the ste nch, 
the ti rednes s, you know?   The  Hol o
ca ust for me , i t  wa s not , _______ 
___________ was not hing to c o mpar
e to what we suffer ed.  But th
e worst sufferi ng 
was that we, I

me and said, "All 
rouse , sc hne ll, 
schnell, schnell."  Al
wa ys sc hnell, al wa ys rouse .
  And they told us to le
ave everyt hing, to l eave our  
bundle s ther e.  We di dn't  have t oo much t o be gin 
with.  And ever ythi ng we nt 
so fast .  And the n t h e  
Gestapo wer e chasing us 
and I reme mber I saw a gate.  It said
 All- mi ght- m uck- fry 
(ph).  All-might-
muck-fry (ph) means 
wo rk ma kes you free.  But 
as I fo und out later, th
e onl y dea d was onl y whe n  
they liberate us.  Onl y 
a few sur vi ved.  Wh
en we came t hey star ted t o
 make selections.  And  
Mengelia, at that time I 
didn't know that this is 
Mengelia , s o me ver y wel l  fed, good l ooking Nazi s, 
with the Nazis unifor ms , wi th th

you c oul dn't tell from the i r fa ces

ma de t he se lectio n wh e n we wer e

started to separate male fr om 
fe ma les  a nd ma ke  sel ecti on.  To t he r i ght  and t o t h

And all of a s udden, when  
we came there facing the gate wher

hand side, which would be the le ft , but on my si de

out to my pa rents .  I said, "Se e
, they kept t heir pr omise .  Th e  
Red Cross stands for he

said, they started to tear apar

 Separate the 
fa milies.  Pulled out children fr om 
the hands of their parents.  Little
 infants away fr

And t hey sta r ted t o ma ke  the s el

And they took away my littl e

selected to go each.  And  
at that poi nt . . . 

Q: How old wer e your br othe
r  and sister at  that ti me?

A: I don't know their  exact age, 
t hey wer e younger than I but I  ju
st go by because I know t hat my  
little sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't 
start yet school.  And 
my brother wasn't yet  
bar mitz va h, so I don't know their exa ct age.  It was,
 at ho me we di dn't cel ebrate birthdays like here 
beca use for t he Je wi sh pe ople didn't , s o me pe ople 
didn't wa nt t o say t heir a ge be cause t hey belie ve  
in the evil eye and things like th
is.  I don't know, superstitious.  
But anyhow, they were still young. 
So when they took them away, my
 mother  was  wit h me , a n d e veryt hi
ng we nt so fas t  that  I di dn't 
even have time to think.
  And then my moth
er  tur ned to me and she sa
i d, "Yit- cola  (ph), you™re  a  
big girl.  I have to go with the little children.  
But reme mber my child, no 
matter what's going to 
happen to you, don't become hate
ful and bitter.  Don't 
let them destroy you." 
 That was her last 
wo rds.  And all of a sudden I wa s a
ll alone.  And t hat 's it, ever ythi
ng t hat I  had, e ver ythi ng, be cause  
I wa s bec a m e dea d.  And I didn't e ven have a cha n
ce to sa y good- bye bec a use I didn't know that we  
are parti ng forever.  I didn't know about gas 
cha mbers , not hi ng.  My per sonal experi ence , not hing 
can hi stori c ally, I neve r kne w about gas c ha mbers .  When you sa w that we were dec eive d. 

Dec eived, we di dn't know.  So t hen
 they lined us up and 
we were taken into th
e, a di fferent wa y.  
And the y le ft for t he barr acks .  And t hey took t he m a w
a y.  I di dn't know at that ti me where, I ha d no 
idea .  No w wh en I kn o w  what 's h a
ppene d, but I me an, at th
e ti me when they took
 us away we didn't 
know.  And t hey t ook a w ay all ol
der people, young childre
n, pr egnant woman.  So I talk to mysel f, I  
re me mber it toda y, look how kind t hey ar e bec ause 
we we re told th at we were a l l  goin g to b e  
toget her .  So we  thought  
that they give them a ri
de, which I a ppre ciate d ve
ry much.  I  fi gured the 
little children, but I had no idea that 
we are parted forever.  Wh o c
ould know that doctors who were 
trained to say the Hippocratic
 oath, that are trained to
 heal the sick are going 
to kill their health.  In 
fact, I wr ote a poem ab
out Me ngel i a.  Woul d yo
u l i ke me  t o sa y it?  
Q: I think I'd like you to conti
nue now and then we 'll see if yo
u feel li ke re
ading it later. 
A: Ye s.  An yho w, wh en they t oo k 
us away all of a 
sudden they brou
ght us into a pl
ace and we were, 
they shaved, fi rst of all  t hey ma
de their number.  We  had to give
 up ever ything.  I re me mber I was  
clutching a little picture, a photogra
ph of my family, and I ha
d to give it up.  At 
fi rst I didn't want t o  
so they started to beat me so I fi gured its not wo
r t h it to, you know?   I kne w that I ' m not goi ng to be  

able  to ke ep it so I  ga ve  it
 up.  And we  ha d t o . . . 
Q: What is  your  numbe r?  

A: My number? 

Q: They gave you a number? 

A: Yes .  2-5- 6-7- 3.  Not e veryone
 got numbers.  The ones who they
 took away to the gas chambers, 
they di dn't get nu mber s.  And 
also, I don't know whether you ar
e a ware , Auschwitz  was Ausc hwit z  
I, II .  I was t ake n t o Bir k ena u 
and Bir kenau was where 
the gas chambers we re, 
all the ga s chambers. 
Q: Were your brother and sister
 still with you at this point?  
A: Wh en they took away . . . 

Q: When the y t ook you i nto 
the  s have d a nd tatt ooi ng . . . 

A: Oh, no, no, no
.  The y i mme diat ely had t he sele ctions.  Ma
ngelia sent t h e m t o t he tr ucks .  And I  
remember they were ho
lding hands, you know, my
 little brother and sist
er.  My brother was 
protecting my little sister, they to
ok them away.  And then
 my mother saw them
 going away.  I don't 
know how
 much she know, wh at sh
e kne w, but a g ain her ___________ , she ma de a fat al choic e and 
she  went  wit h t he c hil dre n.  She  sai d she  ca nnot 
l eave  the m al one , you ar e  a 
big girl .  So tha t  wa s  
the last time I ever saw them.  
The whole famil y 
for four ge ner a tions .  And 
I  had no idea where my 
Aunt, who li ved in War s aw
, she was married with children, my
 Aunt i n the __
______.  Anothe r  
__________, all t he r ela tives .  
I ne ver said good- bye , I  don't kn
ow wh at's happened to them. 
Whet her my Aunt in Wa r sa w die d

We don't even ha ve , you under stand why t his stor
y of Buncho (ph) the S
ile nt, I wa s thi nki n g. 
Because, I don't know whet
her it was just coi nci dental
 that this story had su
ch an effect  on me and  
why I r e membered because 
Bunc ho (ph) t he Sile nt in t he stor
y was 13 years old,
 when the st ep-
mother came.  And also 
I was ma ny ti me s thi nki ng th
at we live for so lon
g, si nce a bout the 1600  
cent ury my ance stor s ca me t o Po
la nd.  And yet , we had t o le av
e e ver ythi ng.  Everyt hing t hat was  
ours t hey inherite d, they took a wa y ever ythi ng. 
 Not hi ng was  ours.  And, you know?   And the n  
when we came t her e, t h ey shaved
 our he ads , e v erybody had sha ved
 heads.  Th e guys, it was done 
too.  And then we 
were the fortunate ones, at that ti mewe di dn't know bec ause good a nd ba d 
fortune can only be understood in re
trospect.  So I didn't realize that
 I was still lucky, that I got the 
number.  At  least I 'm ali ve with 
the number.  And the n 
we re ally got a ba th, we di dn't  get ga sse d,  
but obviousl y, or I wouldn't be here t o  tell you t his
.  But we got a bath, wh
ich we welcomed because 
a shower was, you know?  An d then
 we went out  for, a whole full of
 the fl oor wa s la yi ng uni for ms .  
And they were stri ped, t he sa me t hing as we 
sa w with t he ones who c a m e 
to the train.  And, not 
fr om t he Nazis, thi s wa
s also hefflinger (ph), whi c h means Jewi
sh pe ople  who were i nte rred t her e. 
And the n they ga ve us t hos e uni for ms a nd they t
ook a wa y our s hoe s.  Eve r yt hing wa s take n.  Ou r  
clothes, our shoes, our hair, our na
me.  Ever ythi ng.  And all  of a s u
dden, I realized that to them I 
wa s just a number.  And I reme mber
 that at t he ti me, when they 
c alle d, you know the y  ne ver calle d  
us by na me but number , in or der 
t o dehuma nize us, t hat we should
 gi ve in and give up.  The y  
always woul d call my number , whic h wa s 2-5- 6-7-
3 [in Ger ma n ], a nd when
ever t hey say that I  
always woul d say under my brea th
, "Yit-cola (ph)".  Be
cause I thought t o my
sel f, how can I be a  
number?  I can feel , I can think, 
I can laugh.  Of c ours e I didn't ha
ve fre edom but I ha d free dom of  
mi nd, free dom of t hought s.  And s o 
I, this was my spiritual form of 
r esist ance.  That I re fuse d to se e  
myself through their mi nds.  And af
ter they gave us the, 
instea d of my shoes , whic h was a nice pair  
of shoe s too, they ga ve us  wood
en c l ogs.  And mi ne, unfor tunat el
y, were not  mat chi ng.  And we got  
an ena mel bowl .  And this wa s all our worl dly po
sses sions.  I n one day our entir e pas t  was wiped  
out .  And we  had no fut ur e .  We di
dn't  know it t hen yet.  I di dn't 
know a bout gas c ha m
bers yet.  And 
they marched us into a barrack. 

Q: Let me  a s k you one questi on he
r e.  Was ther e anyone 
in this gr oup you kne w from be for e?   Di d 
you know some  people
 fr om your t o wn?  
A: Sure .  We  ca me  with peopl e fr om
 our town  who were
 in the  ghett o. 
Q: Di d any of the ol der  peopl e tr y t o protect 
you because your mother
 wasn't wit h you? 
A: The older  pe opl e didn't come  i n wit h me . 

Q: Well , older mea ni ng t hree  ye ars  ol der, or?  

A: I n t he ghetto, I mean, in t he concentrati on camp
 there was pret ty much 
solidarity.  However, I  
had one bad experience.  And I 'll come
 to i t .  So when the y gave us
, a nd we always  ha d t o marc h t o  
line up, never, since I came i n 
on Nove mber 22, 1942, 
unti
l  Ausc hwitz wa s res olve d , unti l  Ja nuar y  
18, 1945, I had no longer  fre edom. 
 No free dom.  We were, everyt
hi ng, bec ause fr om the morni n g  
we woke up, we ca me _
_______ i n the barrac k, it wa s a real  
big, l ong barrac ks.  And was three  
layer  bunk beds .  And cr owde d on 
the bunk beds wit h one  bl a nket . 
 An d t hey  were  s o low t hat yo u  
coul dn't sit up.  We  c oul dn't  sit up. 
 The same clot hes, t he shi ft  that  
we got, with this 
I slept.  There 
wa s no night  clot hes .  Fr om 1942 
to 1945 I ne ver brus he d 
my  t e eth .  I  n e ver  sa w my sel f  in a  mirror .  
Nobody eve r  e mbra ced me . 
 Nobody ever sai d, aft er havi ng so 
much l ove.  So when I 'm looki ng  
back from an environment where I wa
s free like a bird, to come to a pl
ace where I felt l ike i n a cage.   
An d you know, you can put a 
bir d i n a  cage but you ca nnot de prive 
t he m of their des i re t o fl y.  The y  
took away my freedo m but 
they couldn't t ake away my
 desire to be fr ee.  Th
ey took away my loved 
one s but t he y coul d not t ake a w ay my de sire t o 
li ve.  And I guess  the r e 
were ma ny horrible t hings  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

but proba bly the most  horrible wa
s l o sing everyone I l ove d.  An
d not  onl y e xper i enci ng my own 
sufferi ng, but wit ne ssing the suffe r
ing of others and have to be sile
nt li ke Bunc ho (ph)  the Sil ent . 
And I c oul dn't s ay a nyt hing.  And i n  the ba rrac k
s, whe r e I c oul d sa y so
met hing when the Nazis 
were not there at night, it was like the Tower of
 Ba bel .  Bec ause eve ryone spoke  a different  
langua ge.  And we wer e too tired, too grie ve d in 
the be ginning.  So when we c a me  in, so many  
people were crowded in t his bar r ac k.  And all of
 a  sudden, from a happy s helter ed lovi ng home to  
be thrown into an environment 
li ke  this .  And ever ybody wa s s u
fferi n g.  M y fir s
t  concer n was, 
when is our fa mily going 
to come?  But I still was 
naive enough to believe 
what the Nazis told us, 
that we are going to get 
united.  So I'm waiting.  
And I don't see th
em.  So I start 
asking questions. 
And t here i s  a cons pirac y al most li ke, s o sil ent .  
Whet her t h ey di dn't wa nt to t ell us beca use  the y  
didn't wa nt t o bre ak my heart , or
 whe t her they we re not allowe d to
?   Thi s I don't 
know, but whoe ver  
I aske d nobody ans w ere d anythi ng. 
 The y di dn't  say yes or no, not hi
ng.  Final ly, a ft er consta ntly 
badgeri ng a nd repeati ng, one of the  girls said, 
"You might as well tell her.  We are all here 
condemned to die."  And 
she point s at the smoke and she said, 
"You see that chim
ney?  This is  
where your parents ar e."   And tells me t he st ory 
about the gas chamber s.  
She said, " Thi s is whe r e  
we 're all goi ng t o be ."  Re me mbe r  I r elated a stor y, 
it was when I was a child, 
I went  t o the funer al ,  
my pare nts t ook me to t he fune ral a
nd t he y t old me t hat, to take your
 own life  is a sin.  It's like  
spitti ng God and your pa rents i n th
eir  fa ce beca use the y ga ve you a gi
ft and its agai nst the Je wi sh 
law.  So I did not for 
once think about committing suicide.  Bu
t at that mo ment, 
if I would have 
bee n abl e to die when I found t his
 out, t hat 's how horri ble my gri e
f wa s.  An d I j us t  wa s rea dy t o  
give up.  I wa s not tr yi ng to t hin
k a bout commit ting s uici de, but I 
be ca me obli vious .  I didn't care  
what 's happe ning.  And a nyhow . . . 
Q: Can I ask you a  questi on her e?  

A: Yes .  

Q: How long do you think yo
u wer e t here  be fore  you 
reali zed t his?  Or  befo
re you were told this? 
A: I didn't know the first day. 
Q: Was it a few months? 
A: No, no, not mont hs .  It was in
 a fe w da ys .  The  exact da y I don't
 know.  Not ver y long, not ver y  
long.  Be ca use I was c onst antl y as king and ba dge
ri ng t he girls .  And I'm 
going to go in later to 
descr i be what a da y in Ausc hwitz wa
s, but for now, t he y ga ve  us the 
ration bread and I felt like, its  
like a funeral for me. 
 I l ost e ver ybody.  So I di
dn't, couldn't , I  wa s sta rve d 
but I  couldn't eat .  So I  
took the bre ad a nd le ft it .  In 
t he mor ning my bre a d wa
s gone .  And one of t h
e girls there, I don't 
re me mber her last na me any l onger, Est her I know
 was her fi rst name, she 
wa s fr o m Ch
air-ta-hoff 
(ph) a nd she  actuall y ca me fr om
 a prison.  I don't know whet
her t he pri son wa s dur i ng t he wa r  
beca use  fr om what  I know s he was 
not a cri minal, so maybe she, the 
Na zi la ws  were  di ffe r ent  th a n  
our la ws .  For kee ping _
_______ on, for wa nting to practic
e our 
religion, for wanting to live.  To 
kill you was legal.  But to
 save a Jewish child or 
a Jewish adult wa
s illegal and punish
able by death. 
To s urvi ve wa s to the m , ever ythi ng that was our  th
ey ha ve t ake n away, if 
we would try to ke ep 
something, we were treated like cri
minals.  So anyhow, in the mo rn
i ng Est her sa ys t o me , " Oh poo  
Yit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread."  And 
I said, "M y gosh, wha t  place is this?   Stealing  
somebody's piece of bread."
  And when I got the ne
xt day my bread, I coul
dn't eat agai n.  Even 
though I was, like my
 thr oat was l ocked.  And I 
le ft t he br ead.  In the ni gh
t for some reason we slept  
so ma ny people on one bunk, s o i f
 one ha d to t urn, so we sle pt  on 
our side s  like s ardi ne s, the ot her ,  
we had to wake the others, so so
mebody woke up.  
And as I wake up, the gi
rl, Esther, who pitied me  
wa s e ating my brea d. 
 An d t hat  wa s al mo st
 like the last straw 
for  me.  And at t hat
 point I just didn't  
care what's happening.  And I was 
sitting and crying.  And 
I didn't know it at th
e time, in 
Auschwitz 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

if you di dn't get up for th
e _________ or the count in
g, if you didn't obey 
the law for a n ythi ng, you 
would ri ght awa y be kill ed, ta ke n to t he ga s cha m bers .  So a girl wal ks ove r  and s he as k me, " Why  
are you cryi ng?"  And I didn't care at  
all, I  was so, so heartbroken, t hat  I just start ed crying.  I j ust  
didn't even want to answer .  Finall
y she, i t  wa s some thi ng in her voic
e, that I felt that like she's 
caring, whic h I st arte d to underst a
nd and I reme mbered 
what my gr andmother use to s ay, " Yes my  
child, but kindness a
nd caring cannot be little thi
ngs."  Like when
 I did the ____
________.  And  
what's happened?  And fi nally I tell her.  And she said, she thought that I cr ied bec aus e of the bre ad, 

I cried of t he  whole sit uat ion, of losi ng the fa mi
l y and e ver ythi ng.  So s he t ook a piec e of her br ead  
and s he br oke it off and s he sai d, " T
a ke it."  And I didn't 
want  to take it .  Bec ause I al ready kne w 
that we are all there to be
 killed, that it's just a ma
tter of time.  So I figure
d I cannot afford to get 
involved with anybod
y, t o care for someone, to 
ha ve a relati onship, be caus e in case one  of us goes , 
there 's goi ng to be  additi onal pai
n, t o  prote ct mys elf fro
m the pain.  But there 
was something in her  
voic e and he r fa ce and e v erythi ng.  
Her na me i s Benac k (ph), a t  the ti me , was Bi nna Gold-cut ( ph),  
Ya nka  Gol d- c ut ( ph) , bec a use  s he use  to ca ll herse l
f Yanka.  And fi nally I 
t o ok t he  bre ad and I s aid, 
"No, I c annot alone , no matt er how 
l ong I ' m goi ng t o li ve, al one.  It
's  not e ven wort h li ving.  I ' m all  
alone."  I t o ok the br ead and Bi nna
 became my dearest fr
ie nd.  And from t hat
 day on, s he beca me  
like my sister.  We cared 
for each other.  We cared
 dee ply for e a ch ot her and 
we hel ped e ach othe r. 
In Auschwit z, a piece of bread mean
t life.  Meant winning in
 the game of su
rvival.  So I 
just felt that  
she wa s so kind, t hat she was a ble
 t o br eak up, and t he cont rast.  
Here, Est her st ole my pi ece o f  
brea d.  And this gir l  ga ve away 
a pie ce of br ea d.  I didn't e ve n 
know until  this da y, I don't know 
when she came, I didn't 
know at that ti me a nyt hing.  Now I kn
ow that she wa s bor n i n Wa rsa w , but  
I didn't know.  At that ti me we 
di dn't  think of it .  And I took t h
e bread and with it so mething in my 
spirit started to soar again and 
we made a commitme
nt, Binna and I.  We  di
dn't know if we were 
goi ng to get out of t here , but to li ve or to die 
with ______________
, with huma nness .
  Not to lose  
our dignity.  And thi s is  i mporta nt t o know, t hat  
in Ausc hwi t z there we r e two ki nds of la ws .  I f 

some body was hungr y a nd while t he y
 wer e carrying the c aul dron wi
t h soup, people would li ft up 
the li d a nd put i n t heir bowl a nd 
gr ab a nd run.  If the y wer e luc ky 
they could run away.  If the y 
caught t he m, they woul d get 25 on their bare be hi
nd.  And someti mes e ve n wo
rs e.  But one i n mate  
fr om the other, that wa s a no law.
  Would not take, beca use  we know 
this meant survival.  And fr om 
1942 t o 1945 I was  in Au
schwitz, nobody ever stole fr om me  a
nyt hi ng.  You know
?   And we  felt  
like we had no freedom at all.  No fr eedom of m
ove me nt , only in our soul and our mi nd c oul d we  
be fr ee.  And just t o feel
 that  I ha d s o me  ki nd of c hoic es yet  
to make.  We  use  to
 switch, you know, 
like to share.  I would gi
ve Binna a little bit of my
 soup and she would give

they were lucky to be to

 be a hair bigger than the ot
her because the starvation was s o  
great .  Binna and I trusted each othe

 our bread.  We didn't
 keep it separ ate and  
she never betrayed me, or vi ce-a-

Q: You wer e  begi nni ng to tell me 
what an a vera ge da y or a typic al da y in Ausc hwitz  was like for  
you. 
A: We di dn't  wake  up by the  cl oc
k.  We  wo ke up, until 
this day I don't know 
what time, I know it 
was still dark.  We  
would wake up and didn't have 
to dress because I slept in 
the shift, the same shift 
that we wore  during the day.  We di dn't have any ex
tra clot hes.  This was al
l that we had.  And there 
wa s water  b ut we we re t old t hat th
is is not good drinki
n g wat er.  S o wate r 
was ver y scarce.  We  
didn't ha ve, we couldn't go t o the ba
t hro o m wh en  we  want ed .  It wa
s like a collectiv
e bathroom, like 
the latrines you know?  A
nd it was j ust a wooden board and in i t 
like cut out a piece. 
 So we c oul dn't  
go where  we want ed and t his was 
a  terri ble t hing beca use  ce rtain 
pe opl e, some ti mes  out of, t here  
wa s suc h a t errible t hirst or a hunge r, that some ti mes 
the y woul d eat thi ngs t hat
 they shouldn't eat, or 
drink.  And there f ore the y
 got diarr h ea.  And be caus e the c o nd
iti ons, we  coul dn't
 wa sh up.  We 
didn't ha ve a nywhere to wa sh.  So it wa sn't clea
n.  And once you got the di
arr hea , tha t  was the end 
of you, bec a use whe n you have  di arr hea you ha ve
 to run a lot and they 
wouldn't let  you go and 
work.  And i f you soil ed 
you rself, then wh en they ma de  the se
l ections, then you 
woul d go now.  S o  
it wa s i mportant.  And in or der t o feel a s ense 
of free do m, since  we c o uldn't wa sh, I could go 
through t he move me nt s of prete ndi
ng that I'm washing my
s e lf, j ust to ha ve 
some , t o  feel  some  
freedom.  So when I got up in th
e morning, it was dark and in th
e summer it was hot, winter was 
cold, and out of habit I was still
 saying the __________, I would s
till say the pray
ers, even in 
Ausc hwitz.  And we would start , 
go t o the ________ where we are co
unt e d.  Alive or dea d, we ha d 
to be _________.  And 
they used the matter t hat
 one wa s re sponsi ble for 
all.  So i f one  pe rson 
would not be found bec ause he 's si
c k or wouldn't come out, or wh
ate ver , we all had to sta nd n o  
matt er how long.  Rai n, in
 the biggest rain and th
e frost without a coat , wi
t hout anyt hing.  I f we  
didn't ha ve , and we woul d stay, fr eez e.  So we us ed 
to try to warm each othe
r, one in t h
e back, you 
know s o me body woul d s t and, you st
ay in the fr ont and s o me body in the bac k and e mbrace e ach  
other .  And one day we coul dn't do it ulti matel y
 because t he Nazis, t hey
 counte d.  And someti me s  
we woul d be  lucky, tha t  ever ybod
y was ac counte d  for.  Othe r t i me s
 we would stay 
for hours.  And 
then they would gi ve us  s o methi ng,
 even t hough we di dn't ha ve  enou
gh  o f  it  an d we  wis h we  wou l d  
have ha d more, but its s
uppose to be  coffee, it re
se mble d muddy wa ter.  A 
little beet .  A piece o f 
brea d.  Some kind of s mell y c hee s e, its li ke Li
mbur ger c he ese, i t  was s mell y.  But we didn't ge t  
enough of it.  We  were 
grate ful  that we  ha d t his  here  be cause
 we wer e s o hungr y t hat we  would ea t 
anyt hing al most.  In fact we had to re strain ours
el ves
, someti me s not to e at things whi ch could ha r m  
us.  And in t he wi nter , be caus e t h
ere wa s lack of water and no place 
to wa sh, we would pick up the 
snow.  And if a Na zi would see  us
 or  the  one who was  watc hing us , 
we  woul d get bea t en for t hat . 
They tried to torture us.  And then after we got 
our ration, we had to line
 up, and I can still hear, 
"Links ."  Li ne up and go marc h. 
 And on both sides big, long lin
e s with the pri soners  mar chi ng , 
with the inmates marching.  And 
I don't know how to ca
ll our selves because wh
en they talk about  
slavery in Egypt or _______
__ was not as bad as wh at we  had, 
yet they don't call them slaves.  So  
prisoners, I don't know wh at, bu
t I feel we  wer e  wor s e tha n 
slaves because slaves ar e not  
condemned to die, you know?   Not 
that way, they used the m for so
met hing.  And we start ed to walk 
and on bot h sides were guards and th
e Nazis wit h  the dogs, t h at went 
wit h us to work
.  And then we  
had t o go thr ough t he gat es, a nd at the gate s ma ny
 times was a dren-dall (
ph) , the y would ta ke out  
some body who didn't wal k too good or
 didn't  look to good.  Ot her ti me
s we  wer e just c a lled, 1- 2-3, 
5-6- 7, the  8
th
 out , someti me s t he 10
th
 out , we ne ve r know.  So you 
c oul d not pl an from one se cond  
to t he other beca use  you don™t k
now whet her you c o me bac k, woul d 
you be ali ve  t he next  day.  
That 's when I realize d how a per son wa s conde m
ned to deat h, you know, 
who has a fa mil y illness

must fe el.  And I found ou
t pretty soon that it was more danger
ous to walk on the outside line so we  
tried to be in the inside line and not t o be the ve r y fir st or the  very last .  The less vi sibl e you c oul d 
ma ke your se lf.  And we mar c he
d.  Whe n I ca me I was assi gne d to Bl oc k 8 and a Turkis h woma n 
was our Block Elster (ph)
.  A Block El
ster (ph) had a little 
more privileges th
an the others, she  
didn't have t o go out t o work but s he  was r espons i bl
e.  And then we went out
 to work and I c annot  
estimate how long of ti
me or how ma ny mile s beca use I ha d 
no wa y of me asuring, but I know we 
worke d snow, winter, s uns hine, it didn't matter .  
 And the n we ca me t o  wor k.  An d we al wa y s 
wo rked outside the camp.  And, 
outer-comma ndo (ph) it was called,
 when you wor ked outside, 
outer -commando (ph) .  
And what I started t o real ize is t hat t h
e work we were doing at that time  was  
not us ual  work.  We  would ta ke ston
e s or  gr avel  a nd carr y it  fr om 
place  to place  a nd t h e Nazi s use d 
to mock us.  And poi nt  to t he  
gas chambers and ____________ th
ey said, " See?  That 's where  
you™re all going to come 
out."  And then he
 sai d, " Where i s  your God 
n ow? "  An d t hat 's wh en  I 
remembered what 
my mother told me, when I 
ha d to go to t h e root cell ar.  "Go, Yit-c ola (ph), go.  
God is in the root cellar to
o."  And I said t o myse lf
, " Go, Yit- cola ( ph) , go. 
 Yo u™re the last one of 
your fa mily.  If you don™t survive,
 the world will not
 know and it will be the 
last.  It's like your 
fa mi ly will not have existed.  Go .  Go d is he
re too.  But ma n is not
 here.  _______________ 
[huma nness ] is not here ."  And I st arted to
 understa nd wha t  _______
______ mea ns , why my  
pare nts str es sed it s o muc h.  And 
I never for once felt like God has fai l
ed me.  I felt the people failed  
me .  Beca us e God give s me n choices  
to do good or evil. 
 But they have chosen
 and they were the 
educated people.  My fa mily always
 stressed education.  
____________ .  In fa ct, 
my fa mily used to  
say t hat _____________ is the 
hi ghe st for m of reli gion, scie
nce and achievement.  And i n  
Ausc hwitz, I  had a cha nc e to fi nd out  that this wa s true.  Be ca use Me nge li a has doctor al degre es . 

And he 's res ponsibl e for the deat
h of 400,000 pe ople including my 
own fa mil y.  So 
I did not doubt  
God.  In s pi t e of what wa s happe ni ng, t hat I sti
ll pray to God and I stil
l believed in God and I 
remembered other things, which 
I didn™t mentioned this story a
nd I think I will now because I 
thought of t h at stor y ofte n.  You 
know, for Pa ssover a nd Ra sh-sha- sh
ona ( ph) e ver y ye ar, re gar dles s 
of how poor you were , or  
rich, pe ople  would get ne w clot hes .  It  
didn't matter whethe
r you had a lot.  
And most, a nd there 
wa s not bi g de part me nt stores like t his
 here , so mostly we would go t o the  
dressmaker to ma ke a dr ess.  That particular su
mmer, I was like in my pr
e-teens, and I reme mber  
my mother  ordere d for me na vy 
bl ue ___________.  An
d t he dres s maker ma de
 me a dress, a t w o-
piece dress, a sail or dress, a pleat
ed skirt with the collar 
like this.  And when we
 we nt t o  try on fi rst 
the me asur e me nts and e veryt hing. And t hen whe n 
the  dre ss wa s rea dy I  would try it  on a gai n a nd 

look in the mirr or and it  fit well.
  And I felt so proud, so ha ppy wit
h
 thi s dres s.  The  sailor dr ess . 
And I ca me home a nd it wa s earl y 
Pa ssover , be for e Pas sover .  So, 
like a child, I want
ed to put on  
the dre ss a n d to show my girl frie nds  what a pret ty
 dres s, I was so pr oud 
of it.  And when I was 
goi ng to put on the dres s, my mot her
 said to me, "Yit-cola
 (ph) , plea se don't  put on the dress now." 

I said, " Oh Mom, i t 's gonna 
. . ."  She said, "It mi
ght get t ore and it might  get st ains a nd t hen yo u 
won't have it for Pas sover."  And I said, "Oh M o m,
 its going to be oka y."  So I re me mber my  
mother said to me , "Yit-cola (p
h), pl ease .  Don't  take cha nce s on some thing you ca n't afford to  
lose."  But as a child I st
arted to nudge, oh please 
and plea se a nd plea se .  So
 fi nally my mother said, 
she says, "Well, you lear
n about responsibility.  Th
at's the only way 
you™re going to learn."  And I 
promi sed I won't, I 'll be care ful.  
And I ha d e ver y intent ions of doi ng 
it, i t  wa s not out of mis chie f  or  
not  cari ng.  And I  put on t he dres s a nd I c a me ou
t.  And I  was very, a c o
mbination.  In one way I 
could be very serious an
d I was very playful and a little tomboy
 and I remember I 
mentioned to you 
that we ha d the ________, the rive
r .  And we use  to go there ,  it had be aut i ful tree s.  And the kids  
ca me and some body c hal lenged, the y  said, " Who can
 cli mb up highest on the tree?"  And I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

pretty good at that, you know?   
I wa s ne ver hea v y, which act ually in
 Pol a nd t hat wa s not l ooked a t 
fa vor abl y.  The y use t o  say t hat s h e has cons um
ption i f you wer e thi n. 
 Pe ople wer e  mor e , s o  
anyhow, in no ti me I cl i mbed up t h is tree, t he 
tree, a nd I wa s, I di sse d the pers on who wa s  
challe ngi ng me .  And all of a sudde
n I  hear  some body sa y, " Yit -cola 
(ph), Yit-cola (p
h) your mothe r  
is coming."  And I got scared 
and I re me mber ed, my gos h, I ' m wear
i ng the good dre ss .  And I we nt  
to get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt.  I 
came down.  My mother wasn't ev
en there, it was just a prank th
e y pl aye d on me .  And I was i n  
tears .  And I  said, " My God.  M y 
mother begged me not to take ch
ances.  Not t o take a chance to 
lose s o met hi ng and now my dress i s  torn."  A
nd I re me mber  like today, I took t he pleats and I 
folded it over so it wouldn'
t show my  flesh, because it was a bi
g tear .  And when 
I came into the 
house with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at
 me, she didn't have to 
ask muc h.  All she  sai d,  
"Take of t he skirt ."  Beca
use she  sa w t he wa y I hel d it wit h te ar
s in my eye s, so 
she put two and two 
toget her .  " And I 'l l  fix i t  for 
you."  But she said, "Re me mbe r one 
t hing.  It 's up to you.  You c a n 
wea r  your  ol d dr ess or t h e dre ss t h
at I 'll fi x for you.  
But you™re going to go to services."  I was 
crying my e yes  out beca use  I didn'
t  wa nt t o we a r  my ol d dre ss a n
d I didn't  want  ever ybody to se e 
that, what  I did wit h t his  dres s.
  But I remembered th
e lesson.  Because my fat her al ways poi nted 
out , in ever ything there i s a lesson.  In ever y expe
rience.  And what I reme mb ered fr om that lesson 
is not to take chances with something I cannot affo rd
 to lose.  And this was 
for me a terrifi c lesson  
beca use  I knew one thi n g I ca nnot a fford i n Aus chwitz
, is to lose my life.  
So what I tried to do, 
many think rather than to take chances like grabbi
ng a little soup, you know, although I was starved, 
I said no.  I don't want 
to take chances because if
 they catch me they can 
kill me or beat me up so  
badl y a nd i f I cannot wor k they'll 
ta ke  me a wa y.  And I  star te d to 
reali ze t here how i mportant it  is , 
the upbringi ng, the i n fluence s t hat
 I  had and t he  l essons  I had.  And 
mostl y  I sa w, you see be for e t he 
Hol oc aust I  had no fr a m e 
of reference with whi ch 
to compar e the t h
ings , t h e value s, and t he t hings  
or the bless i ngs t hat I ha d.  And t he n I had a c hance 
to see what it is to be 
without a fa mily, without 
a Jewish community, withou
t the  ____________, 
we we re al wa ys J e wish  there , b ut we we re n ot ,  
Jewish people were not the only 
people who were in Auschwitz.  
There wer e Gypsies, there were  
Jehova h Witness, there were the Polish people, they
 were  fro m all c ou ntries .   Ho we ver , t he J e wis h, 
we , the Je wi sh girls , we wer e  not
 together with the me n in the sa
me c a mp.  The Poli sh girls wer e  
not t oget her in the sa me barra cks wit h us .  We we re 
separated.  So in all the 
year s that I  was ther e, I  
never had any c onta ct wit h a ma n.  
I ' m not  tal king in a sexual  wa y, bu
t I mean even t o be friends or  
to be in t he company of 
men.  And here, this is my
 teen- age years.  The pr
ice of going to _______, 
the price of higher education t hat 
I was dreaming, to get 
a good, for mal educati o
n.  The price of all  
the things , of liberty, which I started to realize ho
w im
portant freedom is.  Ou
r liberty.  And this is  
when, when I felt all this here, th
e n I felt, oh I wi s h I had a pe ncil and pa per so I could write down  
how I feel .  But I didn't ha
ve.  And at that ti me , I 
wrote in my head to past
 ti me, t o forget, t o run 
away fr om t he harsh real ity.  So 
I remembered t hat  I wr ote a poem 
i n my mi nd a nd it wa s what I felt 
and it wa s, I  fee l  like a bird with cli p ped wi ngs , ti ed
 to t his ea rth by invi si ble stri ngs, c hained t o a

a prisoner that cannot break loose,
 I l ook at the

d I wa s looki ng out a n d seei ng the  
physical  s urr oundi ngs .  Ar ou
nd us wa s the barbed wi
res, the watch towers, 
the crematories.  The 
smoke constantly above 
our heads and beneath us
 wa s mud.  There was so
 much mud there that 
when we wore those wooden cl og
s, sometimes they got stuck in 
the mud and t he feet got wet a nd  
on col d, winter days the y , for a long time you c oul dn't
 even take them off, if
 the feet got  frozen, the  
________ bi te, fr ost bi te, and t he n a ft er a da y like 
this of suffer i ng a nd on t h

We c oul d not, we were not all o wed to

wo rds .  An d  I was t hin ki ng to my s e l f
, my gosh, if this is, if this 
is our _______, I don™ t even ha ve  
the word t o expr ess it , its like a di fferent pl anet .  It's in t he sa me worl d like a di ffe r ent pla net , a  
planet of destructi on, of death.  The dead we
r e not burie d a nd was mountains, e ver ythi ng was  
mountains.  Mountains of 
dead bodies until they buri
ed them.  And constant 
living under th
e fear of 
ma ybe today they are goi ng t o take you a wa y, an
d i f you got sick you ha
d no l uck, the re was n o  
me dicat ion.  Eve r yt hing that they
 promis ed wa s not.  And onc e I 
found out what th
ey do wit h the  
people who come , tha t  they ta ke a wa y, a nd I  he ar
d mus i c pl aying.  And I 
a ske d so mebody, " Where  
is the music?"  An d that's when
 I found out t h at the y have  a 
live orchestra playing.  When the 
trans port  wa s c o ming a n d they ma
de selecti ons, s endi ng a wa y  pe opl
e to the ga s chamber, the musi c 
wa s pla ying.  Classical music .  A
nd later, when I heard t he music, 
I al wa ys starte d to cr y bec aus e I  
kne w t hat my pe opl e ar e  bur ning, th
e music is playing.  
And you know, e v en a ft er the Hol oc aust  I  

always l ove d musi c and singi ng, but 
for a long t i me whenever I start to
 he ar musi c, I s t arted t o cr y 
because the visions of the little child
ren, of everything sepa
rated and how they tore
 apart.  And then , 
aft er a  long day, a gai n, wal king 
through the gate, the selections.  
Some  peopl e got be aten to de ath. 
Other pe opl e  from wor ki ng were inj u red, s o me pe opl
e got sic k .  And ever y day there be ca me less er  
and les ser  of us .  And t he  bodie s, mor e s kelet al.  
And we didn't, couldn't ta ke
 a s hower or a nyt hin g  
and we started to accu mulate lice. 
 So a bi g treat was when we coul
d ta ke off tha t  dre s s and try t o 

________ t o  expos e of t he lic e.  
And people wit h di arrhea, a nd it
 was  ju st Dant e 's I n fer no  is a  
come dy c o mparing to what it wa s.  That 's what I 
say beca use you ask me , did I, it 's i mpos sibl e to 
descr i be e ve r ythi ng.  So we ca me
 back tired, fro
zen, cold, over heated fro
m the heat i n the whol e 
day, we  ca me ba ck, a gai n the a ppeal  (ph), sa y a p p
eal  (ph) and check t her e, 
t here to al ive, we are  
there.  And then we had to wait, 
after they count again 
they give us a little so
up, a little 
bread.  It 
wa sn't e nough to li ve a nd not enou
gh t o di e.  And ma ny
 pe ople , ma ny, c ons tantly people  die d.  And 
seeing, here  you was wi th some b

r e gone.  And consta ntly ne w 
trans port s, a nd you c oul dn't s pea k. 
 So, a nd t he filt h, the star vation, 
the  l oneli nes s.  Like I starte d 

before to tell you, is all this ti
me  not seeing yourself in
 a mirr or , not having a 
toothbrush.  They tried 
to dehumanize us to the 
poi nt where  we  di dn't e v en, I 'm e mb arra
ssed to talk about
 it, but when I 
re me mber what my pare nts t aught
 me, t hat my ______
_____ does not  de pend
 on how other tre at  
me but how I treat  ot hers, 
than I 'm not ashame
d because I  haven't  done anyt
hi ng to deserve it.  We 
didn't even have a piece of
 toil et tissue.  All t he ti me I was i n
 Auschwitz, I  coul dn
't have a pi ece o f  
toilet tissue.  This is how they deprived us.  No
t a  spoon, not a  for k, nothing.  You know, t hey trie d  
to reduce us  to be like non- huma

he mocking consta ntly 
and eve r ythi ng.  So agai n, eac h  
day t he sa me thi ng, over  
and over, starting the ______ and just ha
ngi ng on anot her da y.  Just  i f you  
coul d get  thr ough the  da y, not get  
beaten, not go to the gas chambe
r, go through the day and come  
home t oget h er wit h Bi nna, that 's
 _____________.  
An d many time s, people 
would go in the eveni ng 
and some body would sa y, " Liste
n, I ' m goi ng to give you a li tt le of 
my soup.  You want
 to give me a 
piece of your bread?"  Some people
 preferr ed t he, a little soup to 
t he br ead.  And t he starvation. 
And t hen the  Na zis woul d co me a nd 
t hey woul d say t hat t hey are goin
g t o give  us  ext r a  brea d, who 
wa nts to ha ve extr a bre ad?   And I l earne d ver y 
quickly, whenever they ca

There we re ple nty, I know certai n
 peopl e who I pers onall y kno w

then they take them awa

 c o nsta ntly tr ansport s.  And then wa s one  
day, we wer e calle d _______, the y
 a ske d us to st ay l onger a n d th
ere was a girl an
d he r na me  was 
_____________, so meth
ing with a " Z" be gins, I  for get her last na me , Zi t-a-e mir (ph) , somet hin g 
like t his her e.  I  di dn't know he
r per sonally but I  knew of he r. 
 She was a messen
ger ,  you know?  
And I  don™t  know the e x act st ory b
ecause I don't, I'm not,
 I was not a witness 
when she run a way, I  
didn't se e he r run a wa y.  But I know that one da y 
we were all called togeth
er a nd we wer e, they 
prepared a gallow and they
 were going to hang he
r  beca use s he run a wa y a n d the y br ought her bac k, 
they found her.  And s he , whe n
 they found her, I don't know 
from wher e because in Auschwitz I  
coul dn't get anyt hing mo re tha n 
what  I got , t he bowl  and t he clot
hes.  She  had a ra zor  some plac e  
hidden.  An d before they hang he
r, she cut her wrists in my  pres
ce nce .  Then there  wa s a not her  
hanging.  This hanging I  did no
t wit n ess bec ause Rosa Lober t a (p
h), my __________
, the bea uti ful  
Rosa, t his st ory I just know fr
om my __________, the fe
w t o have sur vi ved.  That she was also 
hanged in Auschwitz because she 
wasn't de ad a nd t hey dest roye d 
one of the crematoriums .  And 
when t he Nazis st arted to lose th
e war, of course I didn't know 
about it bec a use we  ha d no out side  
communication.  Completely cut off.  That 's  why I 
sa y, its i n t h is worl d but  a pl anet  like a di ffere nt 
world because we were i solated completel y.  They
 starte d to s pee d up t he gassi ng and they wa nte d 
to destroy everybody because even
 though he is losing the war but 
he still was carrying on with th e 
plan of destr oyi ng the Je wis h pe opl e.  So the girl
s  made to de s t roy the ga
s cha mbers .  And anyhow, 
there is somebody who's na
me  is
 Noy-ia Zub- o-dal-vic h ( ph) , he
 lives in Israel. 
 And he was able,  
because they kept 
him in solitary, and they
 tortured her.  And fr om hi m I 
know this story.  That they  
hang her .  And be fore t h ey ha nd her, she sai d, " Ha- zak viv-l ots (ph)", t h e strong and brave .  And 
what t hey wanted fr om her is t h
at she  shoul d denounc e, t he y inte
rrogate d her too a nd t h ey wa nte d  
her t hat  she s hould 
tell who the  ot hers  were .  The r esista nce
, you know, she  wa s i nvolve d wit h othe r  
people.  She, from the story t h
at I 've hear d, t h at she was smuggli ng pieces of ammuniti on or  
something, but as I said, I'
m not a wit ness to t hat  but I  heard.  
So t her e was resist
ance but very, not 
spea king for  the Wars a w  ghett o we know that res i
stanc e , but t his I 'm not 
going to spea k bec aus e I  
wa sn't in those ghett os, I wa sn't th
ere.  But the ver y fact , t o want 
it t o go on knowing that nobody is  
left anymore.  There is no place to go back or
 a n ythi ng.  So survi vi ng,
 a nd we di dn't  know how 
other s, what 's going on, wh
at are they doi ng with the war or anyt
hing.  But I kept const antly a ski ng  
myself, the German pe ople at that
 time were the 
most  educat ed people an
d yet t hey di d the mos t  
horri ble  thi n gs.  A doct or who ta kes  t he Hi ppocrat i c 
oath to he al sic k pe opl e 
is  mur deri ng he althy?  
And e ver ything, it see me d to me li
ke ironic al.  The youngst er he 
considered too young to live and  
the old were too old to live and th

bit, they were just

right t o go t o  Hell  and li ve and to suff er and t o di
e there.  So i t was extrem
ely, constantly living with 
pain to see t hat ever yday there is
 l ess  and les s.  And t here  was  
the son-day-commander (ph).  And 
the son-day- comma nde r (ph) was a group of Je wi sh pri soners in 
Ausc hwit z who were oper ating the  
involve me nt  wit h gas sing the people .  And I  di dn™t
 know it then but now, af
terwards I found out, 
and al most I was in there.  I returned to Poland 
a nd I we nt t o t h e ga s cha mb ers now be ca use  I never  
sa w a gas c h a mber i nsi de .  And what
 I, so we sa w, I have phot ogra p
hs a nd I sa w it by mysel f .  The  
process that they had, that to te
ll the peopl e that t h ey are goi ng to 
take a ba th but i nste a d to put on 
gas , thi s wa s  out  complet e
ly of my e xperi enc e both hi stori call y 
and privat ely.  I never  hear d t his . 
And not  onl y that, everything that t h ey t ook away 
that was ours became t heirs
 . . .[e n d of si de 1 of  
tape  3]... You know, all t he val ues
, all the many beliefs  th
at  I 've be en taught and ma ny t hings, I ha d 
to tell them everything. 
 It was  not just t he physicall y, but  t o
 tell them becaus
e I started to ask 
que stions of mys el f.  I said, what i s educ ation 
for if it leads to Auschw
itz , to ga s  cha mber s?  
Imagine.  Not only did 
they took away our poss essions, our homes, our tr
aditions and everything, 
but a lot i n Poland, gol d teeth was 
our  status s y mbol.  Pl us pe ople di d it to fi x their te et h, but those  
who were wealthier used to make 
the crowns for  the teet
h, they put in gold teeth.  So when the 
people were dea d, be fore they went  in they cut  th
e i r hair and t hi s was use d
 for German economy, it  
wa s for matt ress st uffing and e ver ythi ng.  And I was 
thinki ng, we had str a w mattre sse s .  My par ent s  
didn't go t o colle ge, and my gra ndmo t
her.  But how di d they li ve?   I 
started to compare the values. 
And the n, is anot her thi n g, from t he teeth they took
 away ever ythi ng a nd t hey
 selected, the glasses, 
and e ver y si ngle t hing they took a wa y from e ver y part  of t he body.  Fr om t he ski n, l a mp sha de s and 

ever ythi ng.  So ever ything was, again, what i s te
c hnology for?   And t his is
 why, whe n I got out , I  
coul d no l onger have t he sa me val ues .  I had to t e
a r  down e ver ythi ng and t o 
compar e.  What did my  
pare nts tea c h me?   Wha t  did my gra ndmother t e ach
 me?   What does my  re
ligion teach me?  That 
the most i mporta nt thi ng was a huma n li fe, t o sa ve 
one li fe, the Tal mud te ache s us , is l i ke to s ave  
the whol e world.  And here was 
my mothe r  who di dn't ha ve colle ge degree s, was a extre mel y 
intelligent woman, well-red and inte
lli gent a nd ver y artistic , but  she didn't ha ve coll ege de gree .  And 
yet s he re sist ed.  She resi sted bot h physical ly a nd sp
irit uall y.  She di d not gi
ve up Cal - fus (ph) .  And 

fr om one person that is now seve
ral generat i ons of people.  Ca n you i magi ne how ma ny ge nerati on s  
would be if they wouldn't have
 killed the six million
?  How ma ny people?  
And one Menge
lia could 
do so much da ma ge.  And tha t 's  
when I starte d to realiz e, by goi ng bac k.  Not eve r ythi ng that I  
reflect whil e  being there .   Many thi n gs I re flect e d
 upon until  this da y.  And I start e d to sa y, s o I 
realize d something ver y i mport ant . That four gr oups of people ac
t uall y influe nc ed my desti ny. 

Because the Nazis, t he only reason 
why t he Nazi s  did t his to us is 
be cau se we wer e  b or n Je wis h.  I 
did not choose my parent s and my 
par ents didn't c hoose to die in th
e gas chambers, to be murdered. 
The y di dn't die.  They 
di dn't die .  The y were murdered.  Th
ose who st arve d of star vati on, thos e who 
were killed or those fr om diseases
, they were murdered 
because they put us in
 those conditions.  
 
And ever ything that  was  ours  beca me  
their  by brute for ce, by t error an
d by dec epti on.  And t his  is  
why I start a bout honest y.  And the n I  started t o re
alize, when I  look bac k now, I reali ze d also t hat  
there a r e s o me t hings you ca nnot 
buy wit hout money but t her e are al
so s o me t hings we cannot buy  
for mone y.  And t hose ar e 
the things that I miss 
t he most .  No mone y i n 
t he world can replace t he  
six million Jewish
 people and fi ve
 million non-Jewish 
people who were murdered by the Nazis. 
Q: I wa nt to ask you some  specifi
c que stions about Ausc hwi t z.  You'
ve t old me quit e  a bit but I 'd 
like to learn a little bit mo
re about who the guards were?  How 
they treated you?
  Wh o were the 
people you lived with?  Wh
ere were they fr om and 
did that keep
 cha ngi ng? 
A: Well in Auschwitz ev
eryt hing ke pt c ha ngi ng constant ly.  
Bec ause pe ople we re dyi ng ver y fast , 
oka y?   And people wer e  comingc onstantl y.  So t he tur nover wa
s ver y quick.  Pe opl e ca me.  The  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

people in Auschwitz, we wer e in 
the same barr ack but as I tol d you
, we coul d not speak each other 's  
langua ge.  Some could.  The pe opl e  who s poke  
Yiddish ca me very ha ndy for me.  Because i n  
Europe not everybody,
 but those who came from re
ligious  homes, t he y c oul d s pea k Yiddish.  So it,  
as far  as the guard, t he peopl e in
 the barra cks  I c oul dn't s pea k with
 everybody, nor di d I have t h e  
ener gy, nor wa s there e n ough ti me . 
 We came home, we were dead 
tire d.  And once we gave us the  
piece  of br ea d we were 
l ucky t hat we could lay 
down our  hea ds bec aus e before  we knew it, it wa s 
mo rni ng  ag a i n.  
Q: How ma ny people slept 
on your be d wit h you?  
A: I think it was 
li ke about si x pe opl e  or  some thi n g li ke t his  he re. 
Q: In that  one-thir d of t he  bunk?  

A: Ye s.  And the bunks 
wer e so l o w you couldn't sit up.  You 
couldn't si t up.  And s o meti me s it  
happe ned that s o mebody die d i n t he  mi ddle  of t h e ni
ght .  Couldn't do anyt hing
 about i t .  The cor pse. 
Q: We re you a ware , I mean at c ertai n peri ods be
caus e you were ther e a l ong t i me, you were there  
two years?  

A: I wa s fr om 1942 to 1945. 

Q: Yeah, the  end of 1942? 

A: In  No ve mb er.  

Q: Yes .  We re you a ware  of peri od
s when t here were less peopl e ther
e or all of a su
dden t here was a 
huge ne w tra nsport comi ng i n?  

A: Towards the end when they started to lose  th
e war , t her e was more  tran sp ort.   The y we re 
bringing more people.
  It's like, it seem
ed to me from looki
ng back now, that H
itler was determined 
to destroy everybody.  He was al
so deter mi ned that ther e s houldn't be any tra ces .  And another  
thing, which, see somebody wo
uld run away.  Everything is relevant
 to conditions I've learned.  For 
insta nce , i f  one girl woul d r un a way, t here  were  a l o
t of obst acl es.  The fir st  
obstacl e was that i f one  
would run a wa y the othe rs woul d sta y in ______
__ until t hey found _______ 
of t hat, we al l woul d  
be puni shed.  So those 
who had a c ons cious a n d wh
o car ed said, how c an I s ave my li fe a t  the  
expens e of other s?   Sec ondly, the y evac uate d, 
Au sc hwitz wa s calle d b e fore Os wi e c i m, it wa s a  
town.  In fact there is 
a survi vor  who is fro m Oswi eci m.  That
 was her hometown.  
So it was a town 
like any other towns in
 Pol and.  So they clear e
d, they evacuated all t he 
peopl e from t here because 
they di dn't wa nt to ha ve witnes
ses.  Plus for mi les and mile s aw
a y ther e  were no pe ople s o you 
coul dn't hide .  And Aus c hwi t z, 
Birke nau was  the  onl y c onc ent r atio
n camp  to my  knowledge, but I 
don't know e veryt hing, s o  as far 
a s I  know until  thi s da y Bir ke n au
 wa s t he o nly co
ncentration camp  
where  the y ma de , t hey put on nu mbe r
s.  So you had t he nu
mbers.  Your  he ad wa s sha v ed.  You ha d  
no, you wer e we aring the cl
ot hes .  And the sa me nu
mber that you ha d on th
e ar m wa s also put on  
the dr ess , s h ift .  Where c oul d you go?   And t here  
was bar be d wire s, guar d s, watc h towers.  So it 's  
one of the two, she would want to
 go to the barbed wires because,
 so two things happened.  Either 
you get elect rocut ed or you get s hot
 from the guards.  So it wa s impo
ssi ble al most t o r u n a wa y from  
Auschwitz. 

Q: Di d pe opl e try?  

A: Not t oo ma ny trie d fo
r the reason that I  tol d 
you, be ca use t here was no 
place  to go.  Who woul d 
take you i n?   Where woul d you go
?   So not t oo ma ny people.  Some
 pe ople  mi ght have jumpe d th e  
train, but I don'
t know of any. 
Q: Were ther e many sui ci des? 

A: Relatively very fe
w.  That I am
 surpri sed.  Very few.  For me, 
its like, when I to
ld you, at the 
poi nt when Binna and I deci ded to 
accept  it, I  accepted her pi ece of br ead but I also accept ed what  
she offere d more, her fr iendshi p.  
At that point, I ma de a decisio
n.  I will , first 
of all, of my

upbringing, I told you what
 my, this here had a ve
ry great influence.  
Plus I said, I will not 
colla bor ate i n my own destruction. 
 I  did everyt hi ng to tr y to kee p
 mysel f  clean, to keep mysel f, 
under t he c o nditi ons.  I e ven went t hr ough li ke t he  
motions of wa shi ng my sel f 
just to fe el and try to 
think, its ironic we were thinking
, I r e me mbe r  that Bi nna a nd I was 
tal king, sai d, i f we 're going to 
go out fr om here, once in 
my lifetime I want to s
till have a whole loaf of
 bread.  That was my 
drea ms .  Dr ea ms c hange.  It wa
s one of my dreams.  Wh en I wa
s, before the Ho
loca ust, I wa s 
dreaming of getting a good 
formal education, become
 a writer.  When I wa
s in Auschwitz, I was  
drea mi ng a b out once i n my li fe, be fore I die , on
ce to have t he feeli ng of
 not going, my stoma ch 
should not turn fr om hunger, have
 cra mps, hunger cra mps.  And the ot
her dream was still to be free. 
To be able to walk once in my 
lifetime still without th
e guards walking with 
me, with the guns and 
havi ng t o ma rch.  I- spy-dr y-links ( ph)
, I-spy-dry-links (ph), I stil l hear 
that in my head
, the columns .   
And t o se e peopl e dying and sufferi
ng in a world of destruction wh
en I was br ought  up to r es pect  
life.  This was, a nd a not her thi ng t ha t  we were na
ive, a nd I s e e now that it s not s o, is t hat whoever 
goes out, if I have one dress, ju
st a clean dress and someplace to
 put my head I will not ask for 
anything more, but if I have a lo
af of bread, a clean dress.  We wa
nted so little.  But we still have 
not faced reality then be
cause in concentration cam
p, in Auschwitz, I was 
with other people.  And 
actuall y, e v en though the conditi ons were sohorri ble , some body still  took care ,  I still have 
someplace to, even that 
was the horrible conditions, but I had 
where to put my 
head down.  And 
even though there was so 
little, hardly enough to ge
t through the day, fo od, 
I still had somebody.  So 
aft er a ge 13 I was neve r on my 
own.  I  ne ve r, I wa s pr otecti v
e, loving environment.  Here 
compl etel y alone except for Binna,
 w h ich b eca me  my  frie
nd fr om, i n Ausc hwi t z.
  I didn't know her 
fr om before.  And t hen, t o
 go out in t he worl d, I didn
't face it because at that 
ti me all we had, all we 
wer e thi nki ng about  is of sur vivi ng.
  Of having the thi ngs , t he things 
t hat I wa nt.  So 
at that ti me I  
wasn't thinking of
 other things.  It's not un
til I came out __________ that 
everything hit 
me.  And so 
we wer e  in Au sc hwitz a nd 
with all this here, consta
ntl y de ad around us.  No separati on bet we en li fe 
and de ath.  The  de ad pe ople  were no
t buri ed t her e.  They put  the m, th
ey took them in, they had like 
a little wagon and they 
would pull them away.  And if somebody 
died when we were
 at work or was  
killed, we had to carry th
em back to the concentr
ation camp to be counted,
 because we knew we are 
account able.  They made
 us responsi ble, one for
 t he other.  
And this was goi ng on
 for  years.  And  
not  ha ving, l oneli nes s, c o ld, star vati on. 

Q: You had t o c arry bodi e s, you 
per sonally ca rried bodies  ba ck?  
A: I pers ona lly was fortunate t hat I di dn't ha ve to
, but there we re many ti
mes that our commanders,  
you know, i t  was a comma nder, you 
were assi gned to a s pec ifi c 
group, we had t o c arry home ,  
somebody was killed or died
 on the way, we had to 
carry them ho me.  Dead or
 alive they had to be 
account ed for. 

Q: Do you re me mber  ot he r thi ngs t hat
 you and your frie
nd tal ke d a bout?  
A: We was talking about how, that
 when we goi ng to ge
t out we are going to 
be grate f ul.  And you 
know, I 'l l  tel l  you somet h
ing.  You know, int uiti on has nothi ng to
 do wit h logi c, ri ght?   But yo u 
know, I once read that t he 
heart knows of t he rea son, that rea son 
doesn't know heart.
  But actually, 
one time, its like, I don't 
know, it wa s not at ni ght, 
its not what I was dre a mi ng.  Its j ust li ke a , its  
like a vi sion that I see t h at I am free and people 
a r e standing around me a
nd as king me what the 
numb er is.  I didn't know whether th
e outside world knows.  I didn't kn
ow at all what  it  was.  I  was  
isolat ed.  I magine, in older year s, not  only did th
ey take away everything 
fro m me but they stole  
three , si x ye ars, ne arly s i x year
s  of my li fe .  They st ole  the  ch
a nce of e duc ation. 
 They stole t h e 
chance, I never could go to 
proms, to dates.  So fr
om one thing to the other.
  And still 
they didn't 
fi nis h i n Aus chwitz .  In
 1945, it wa s J anuary 8.

Q: Oka y, but  I wa nt t o stil l as k you a  
few more questions before we move on? 
A: Yes .  
Q: Wh en it started getting, more tran
sports would come in. 
 Did the conditions get worse or did they 
stay pretty mu
ch the same? 
A: The condition got c onstantl y wo
r s e for me bec a use I bec a me we ake r .  My body wa s al mos t  like  

a skeleton.  And t he longe
r you suffer the harder 
it get s.  And t o see  the consta nt dest ructi on. 
Bec ause I , I cannot prai s e mys el f and say, but  I ha d, it
 was helping me to see th
e peopl e suffer.  It  i s 

helpi ng me when I  see t hat, I want
e d to hel p s o me body.  They didn'
t all ow us  to hel p eac h othe r . 
We ha d to do it in hi ding.  Let 's sa y if s o me body
 fell a nd you were to li f t  up a nd t o help you got 
beaten.  Sometimes you 
both could get killed. 
Q: So you got we aker but you 
didn't get less food or trea
te d worse or anythi ng like  that?  
A: We ll per sonally i t  di dn't c h
ange that much, but t he onl y thin

trea ted with r es pect beca us e  
ever ythi ng t hat God cr ea ted s hould, but the dogs had 
better than we had.  They
 l oved all  their dogs . 
So me ti mes  t hey  wo uld 
let their dogs bite 
some  peopl e.  And a lot  of mo
ckery.  That I felt, okay, 
they say that they had to 
carry out their duty.  But th
ey real ly didn't.  They 
coul d r esist .  They c oul d 
say no.  They couldn't maybe, when
 Hitler became so powerful, but th
ey could have done that in the 
begi nni ng.  My mot her r i sks my

But at least we tried not

which is not, it didn't happen then . . . 

Q: Let me just, I just want to fi

A: T h ere  wa sn 't  s o

Q: Well , but  there  were  
peopl e olde r t han you?  
A: Yes, ther e were 
peopl e ol der .  No.  People wer e hel p ful 
t o each ot her because 
we knew t hat we 
are, we shar e the same 
circumstances, t he same desti ny.  Th
ere were, I  talk mostl y  about Bi nna 
because I was closest wi th her .  Wit h her I beco
me, we shar ed such a tr aumatic, such an extreme 
experience.  And t hat 's 
wh en you really get to know people
.  That 's where the weaknesses, and 
when I saw t he cont
rast of Esther to her.  With Esther I ne

wish if she is alive 
until today, I don™t even 
hold that against her beca
use under those circumst ances not everybody was

A: There wasn't  to

we re col d, we wer e  tir
ed constantly.  On  
the job you wer e this , but I could f
eel  for i nstance that Binna cared fo r me.  Because as
 I went to the 
gate , we wer e goi ng t o go thr ough t h e gate , a nd wh
en she knows that they 
always looked how you 
look, not t ha t  they ne ede d __________ beca use  t hey

and they wer e Nazi , so 
she woul d sa y, " Yit- cola  (ph) , you ar

 I woul d do the s a me for her .  
If we stood i n the pe n or
 where we st ood, she sai d, 
"Get into this light."  
She was three years ol der  
than I, so it was like, in
 fa ct, after the liberation 
wh en we  we re to geth er s o
me people said, "Well, 
she's acting like she's your mother
."  She just felt about me lik
e I ' m her younger sister .  But  
affecti on, huggi ng, kissi ng?   There was not , no, th
ere was not  affection.  Yo
u feel , you don™t ha ve  
just __________, okay, physi
cal a f fe ction i s ver y  i mporta nt b
ecause at home I c oul d not wal k by 
my par ents or my gra ndmother wit h
out a hug and a kis s.  
But this was not the pl
a ce, it  was not t h e  
ti me .  I f you would se e, we were s o t hin, so s kele t al
, so dirty, so lonely, so 
terrible, so full of pai n,  
that those thi ngs wasn't even on 
the mind.  You know, the hug.  It 
wasn't because we hug each ot her ,  
there  was  not, you c a me home  fro m 
work.  I don't re memb
er it, s pec ial huggi ng eac h other .  The  
onl y ti me  was li ke i f one of us
 broke down, the other wo uld embr
ace and say, try to comfort  and  
say, especi al ly like this.  No, I fel t  depri ved 
a nd I mi sse d this a l ot because I wa s al ways an 
affecti onat e pers on. 
Q: That's why I was asking you. 

A: Yes , I  mi ssed it  terri bl y. 

Q: Were you at all aware of
 when Jewish holidays were? 
A: No. 

Q: Di d you have  muc h i n for mati on about  the  re st

the rest of the camp? 
A: Not at all .   Very is olat ed, not
 knowing what, jus t  this worl d.  
Getti ng c up, coming to t he barr ac k, 
waiting, and by the ti
me you got your
 piece, little food, and everythi

_____ finished, 
espe ciall y in the cold, you wer e 
so gl ad, you were  so tired that 
you lai d down.  Some ti mes you wer e  
too tired to 
talk even. 
Q: Wh en you first got there, we
re there pri soners  who had be en 
there l onger who would give  you  
advi ce? 

A: When I c a me in the beginning, I descri bed t o y
ou the condi tions .  I wa s  very, ver y down, very 
wo rried to wh at's happened to my
 fa mi ly.  But  when I found out 
I wa s so, felt be traye d, I  felt  
shocke d, I fe lt grie ved, I fel t  so many e moti ons .  An
d I wa s just, I don't know
 if it wouldn't be for 
Binna , whet her I woul d have e ven su
rvive d.  J ust knowi ng tha t  we  ne
ed each other  for  support , t hat  
she is already an orphan and al
one.  And you ca n't  i m
agi n e  ho w ma n y  ti me s 
I told her 
about the 
story, Buncho ( ph)  the  Silent.  Beca use  I re me mb
er t hat , when my mother
 finished r eadi ng thi s 
story and I a ske d her , I 'l l  never fo
r get this, and I sa id, " H ow could 
Bunc ho ( ph) t he Silent endure s o  
mu ch  su fferi ng a nd  pai n? "   A nd  my mo ther  an s w
ered me, " M y child, some
ti mes are many stronger  
than iron and other time
s we can't enough lie, but no one know
s their own strength until they ar
e 
ever t ested."   And t hat 's when I 
found out, i f somebody woul d tell me
, this I re me mber this thing.  
That t he ver y fir st ti me when Ica me  and I sa w the conditi ons, I sa w ever ythi ng.  And for the fir s t  

time I was isolated from my fa mil
y, I said to myself, at that time 
I was not  in contact with anybod y 
yet, I 'm not  goi ng t o s ur vive  her e  
one da y.  And you know somet hing?  
 It was ironic. 
 Wh e n  I  we nt  
on the M arc h of the Livi ng, t here wa s a girl and the 
first day s he sai d to me, "Yit-cola ( ph) , I 'm not  
goi ng t o ma ke it."  And I sa
id, " Sur vivors  don't gi ve up, hone y."  
And I told her, that when I was in 
concentr ation camp, that I '
m not going to ma ke it , an
d I made i t .  You're goi ng t o ma ke  i t , I ' m goi ng 
to hel p you.  And s he cal led me , y
ou know, what kind of awar d I go

And al l the kids say, I 'm l ike a Bobbie (ph) to

Q: Di d you t oward the e n
d do di fferent wor k a ssi
gnments or did you stay
 mostly on that one?  
A: No.  Toward the e nd of it al mo
st, t oward t he end of 1944 I got a lucky str oke .  I was given a jo b 
to the ___________, 
t h e __________ t hey call ed
 it, t he _____________. 
 _________ they were 
called beca use we  were  wea ring re d kerc hie fs .  

Q: How did you get this assignment? 

A: Just was lucky.  Some
body must have die d or  
somet hing or ma ybe they 
needed more.  I don't 
know.  But one day, instead of taki
ng me out, they took me to the 
commander.  And that wa s, I wi sh  
it would have happened earlier then I  would not have
 lost so much wei ght 
and so much suffering. 
Because thi s  was better, for several 
reasons.  First of all, you didn
't have to work outside.  The 
outsi de  wor k was  a  kill er.  Ma ny
, ma ny people  die d.  I  was  youn
g and ma ybe t hat 
helped me t o  
survive, I don't know.  But anyh
ow, i n the ____________ 
we would go, we work
 inside.  Our work  
consisted of selecting, you
 know the people who arrive d the y to
ok away everyt hing
 fr om them.  It 
came fr om t he, and all  
t he bundle s wer e br ought 
to t he ___________
__, they call ed i t .  Why the y  
called it Canada (ph) I cannot tell yo
u, I don™t know.  But 
this is what it was 
call ed.  And my job,  
and the jobs of those who were there, wa s to take
 a part  the  bundl es and to
 se lect  a nd t o put  in  
bundles the towels with towels, 
and all this went to Germans fo
r t heir ec ono my.  Everythi ng t hat  
was ours became t heirs. 

Q: Was  it str ange goi
ng t hrough othe r  pe
opl e 's  bel ongings?  
A: It was ve ry stra nge .  But we 
ha d no c hoic e .  We ha d to obey or
de rs.  At lea st, it was not hurt i ng 
people .  Those wer e t hings.

Q: You were telling 
me a bout t he wor k c o mma ndo at Ca na da . 
A: Ye s.  In Ca nad a  we had to work  also  ev er
y day.  My work consis
ted, and everybody's wo rk 
actually consisted, we took apart the 
bundle s and we ha d to se lect the m.  Put each ite m of the sa me  
kind in bundles and in pl aces.  Now, l et me start 
with the advantage for me. 
 The advantage was that 
I didn't have to work outs
ide.  I was shielded a li
ttle fr om the cold and fr om
 the heat.  The wor k was 
easier than i t  was to dr ag the stones and everythi
ng else .  And also I coul dn't take a nything fr om 
there but t he r e were Naz i s that we re wat chi ng us  
too.  But what I c oul d do, occ asi onally but not  
always , nobody could se e.  Let 's sa y 
i f I found a pi ece of brea d, I coul
dn't ta ke it out but I coul d ta ke  
a piece of it and eat it.  
So that provided a little 
extra fo od for me.  Then 
there was something that 
they di d t hat  if it woul dn't  be  
for  wh at my  mo the r  t a ug ht me ,  th
at my  ___________ does not depend 
on how othe rs treat  me but how I t rea
t others , I woul d fee l  as ha med t o 
tell this here.  
It's just like a 
woma n who is raped, and it doesn't  have a good
 self and she doesn't understand that it™s the 
victi miz er not the victi m  who is s uppose to feel 
a s ha me d, the n I would feel asha me d to t e ll you t his  
here .  But I don't .  I fe el pained. 
 When we were l eavi ng, ever y si
ngle day, the most
 humiliating, the 
most painful thing, they
 wo uld search us intern
ally so we  wo uldn't smug
gle out a ny di a monds , a ny  
gol d, beca us e someti me s  you did fi nd those thi n gs the r
e.  So we c oul dn't  take out anythi ng.  And 
that was so humiliating 
for me.  A gi rl who was 
mode st, who wouldn't e v en 
undre ss i n fr ont of he r 
pare nts .  And you know I wa s lik
e a buddi ng te en-ager when t he Hol o
ca us t begun.  And her e, t o go 
through, t hat  someti mes I wish I 
would have still walked in th
e outsi de commando because each  
time they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches
.  It was so humiliating a
nd so disgusting to hav e  
these Nazis t o search me.  So as 
far  a s this , i f you hear d st orie s th
at some body s muggl e d out, t hat 's  
not true.  _________, ma ybe they di dn't tell you, but 
they searched us.  They 
searched us every inch, 
all over, even internally
 so wh at, how can you 
s muggle  s o met hi ng out?  
Q: Were you sear ched
 by me n or women?  
A: So me ti mes were  men , s o meti me
s wo me n.  It wa s not, and eith
er way it wa s disgusting, it wa s 
horri ble.  I feel, I cannot  tell y
ou how much, how I 
felt.  Because 
I was never, unti l I came t o  
_____________ I never had a 
i nternal exa mi nati on.  And thi s wa
s my experie nce , it wa s horr i bl e .  
And a l so the horribl e t h ing was t o
 see, to know t hat , seei ng all 
the things fr om 
so me fa mili es  
brought beautiful thin
gs beca use  the y  we re not i n ghett o, the y
 ca me i n a nd ma ny pe opl e  we re ric h.  
And knowing that the pe opl
e are dead and t hat t h ese cl othes ar
e going to go away for the German 
economy, t h at for t he Jewish child
r e n who were wea r ing the clothes, Je wi sh mot her s and fathe r s  
and grandfathers.  I shed plenty 
of tears.  The only ad
vantage was that I was 
warm and had a litt le 
bit of e xtra  food.  That  was 
t h
e onl y a dva nta ge of t his j ob. 
Q: So i n your t w o year s  pl us i n Aus chwitz , basi
cally you had this job a
nd you ha d that out sid e  
wo rk?  
A: That 's all .   It started physi call y and e moti ona
lly and spiritually in ever
y single wa y.  That 's why I 
relate d to you the st ory a bout go
ing to ___________ because I thou
ght, how could a wr iter stand so 
much sufferi ng and abuse,
 and I don't know ________
 because at that ti me, 
it was almost like it felt, 
why was Buncho (ph) the 
Sile nt sile nt, why didn't he sa y somet h
ing?   But I had t o fi nd out that I  
had t o be si lent t o survi ve beca use eve n whe n 
t hey called me number , tr
ied to reduce me to a  
number, I c oul dn't sa y l oudly or
 anythi ng, but und
er my br eath I s aid, Yit-c ola ( ph).  You know 
wh at I called my number?  My ba
dge  of honor.  And s o me body a ske
d me  onc e, a reporter, why do  
you ca ll it  your  ba dge of 
honor?   And I tol d hi m.
  I got  the number  mer el y for being bor n J e wish. 
To be born Jewish 
or Gentile is not 
a choice, but to mu
rder people because 
they are different,  
because they are Jewish or Gen
tile and because somebo
dy gets a crazy idea
 that somebody i s

superior to somebody else, which 
is a fi gment of 
Hitler's imaginatio
n, then this is something whic h 
ma de  me ev en mo re  
pr oud to be  Je wish. 
Q: Toward t he e nd, di d you have a 
se nse t hat you mi ght get out of t h
ere?  That t he 
war  wa s s hi ftin g,  
that there was a possib
ility you would be fr ee? 
A: I had no, I didn't ha
ve  any knowle dge  what  wa s going out si
de.  There was no pa per , no ______ 
of c o mmuni cation, no meeting wit h a nyb
ody else .  I  di dn't ha ve a ny contact . 
Q: No ru mo r s ?  

A: No rumo rs.  Not hing.  I didn't
 he ar a nyt hing.  I don'
t know, it seemed to 
me l i ke  all I di d wa s  
work, come home , jus t  waited.  C
oul dn't wait t o ge t, to la y down, 
to put down your he a d, it was s o  
exhaust ed and c old.  And some ti me
s, you know what wa s our, but 
that wa s not done deliberately, 
we sle pt so ma ny on one  bunk bed.  So out of ne
cessit y of the overcrowded
ness we sl ept on the si de  
like I t old you, cl ose one another.
  So that was our, you know bo
dy give s out heat t o o.  So we ha d 
one  bla nket, ever ybody was pulli ng i n
 different direction.  So layi
ng, whoever was lu
c ky was la yi ng  
in the middle, felt less co
ld.  So it was not, its an existence, 
not knowing.  Ca n you imagine?  All 
thos e years , not havi ng t he thi ngs
 wh ich you take for granted.  Like
 a piece of toilet tissue?  How 
degr adi ng. 

Q: So you ha d no ide a
 what was going on?  
A: I didn't know anythi ng what was goi ng on.  I wa s 
living, e ach da y was the sa me fr om da y to da y. 
Just  kne w i n war dly, e motional l
y, spiritually that I need to
 hol d on.  But that 's all .  
Q: And by sayi ng tha t , I need to hold on, th
e r e obvi ously wa s some h
ope that you would get  
through it?  

A: No, I don't.  But you know wh at
?   I re me mbe r ed t he upbri ngi ng I 
had, that we ne

give  up hope .  We  don't give up

______________, whic
h me ans as long as
 one vein is still
 moving there is ho
pe.  So we were 
hoping.  I ha d even a fter th
e Holocaust situations wh
ere ever ybody gave up h
ope .  I  di dn't.  I 'm not  
this ki nd of a  per son. 
Q: So how did you happ
en to leav
e Auschwitz? 
A: I di dn't , a gain, I di dn't  ma ke a ny c hoic e.  
In Ausc hwitz, t h e onl y choi
c e I ma de i s, you cannot  
always  pic k circums t anc es but you c an pi ck res p ons es
.  So t h e onl y c hoi c e I ma de, to live or to die , 
with dignity, with Menschlichk
eit , and to hold on as long as I ca
n.  So I di dn't make a n y choice , but  
one mor ning we woke  up a nd I 
didn't even know what's happ
e ned.  We didn't ha ve t he  
______________.  The y 
starte d to chase us out .  And we star
t ed on the de ath marc h.  And that wa s 
the most hor r ible thi ng because yo
u s urvi ve for so long and her e we ha d to mar ch be ca use the Nazis  
wanted to make sure that we shou
ld not get into the hands of the Ru
ssians.  They wanted, they blew 
up s o me, I didn't s ee the m do t hat, but lat er I wa
s, now I know how ma ny thi ngs they ble w up . 
They tried to destroy all the ev
i dence of t he cri mes that  they 
committed.  So we
 had to march. 
Q: What did they sa y t o
 you?   
What  happene d?  
A: The y di dn't s ay a nyt hing.  The y  said, "Just 
go.  Go."  And wha t  happ
ene d, a n d we eve n i n 
concentr ation camp we wer e
 not all owed ulti mately t o help each 
other, i n their pr esence.  But her e  
was even worse.  Because i f one, 
we  had t o walk.  It was, i m agine Pola nd is ver y, ver y col d.  We  
were now in April and it
 was still pretty cold. 
Q: Ja nuar y. 

A: No, no.  I was . . .

Q: Oka y.  But I ' m talking a bout, I 'm c onfusi ng 
this.  Let 's  stay with 1945 bec aus e  it's getti ng  
confusing. 
A: Ri ght.  I ' m jus t  
trying to tell you th
e truth, very cold. 
Q: It wa s in January?  

A: In Ja nuar y, Ja nuar y 18
th
 we were chased out.  
I di dn't know at t he t i m e 
i f ever ybody was l e ft or  
not be ca use there was no ti me to 
fi nd out.  And what the y di d or
 didn't do, once I wasn't t here I  
coul dn't s ee.  But we had to marc h 
on foot .  I f you stoppe
d, i f  you fe ll, t he y shot
 you.  I f
 some body 
fel l or  couldn't go you were not 
allowed to help them. 
 So many pe opl e, ther
e were plenty pe opl e  
who I sa w on the wa y who was la yi
ng dea d.  And we could not do 
anything about it.  This is the  
most, this pr oba bly, besi des  my 
own experience from my  own sufferi
ng, this was the most horrible  
thing fo r me .  To be human and no
t to be able to help
 another human being,
 i f some body falls . 
Live d for s o  ma ny ye ars  and the n in
 that way to die?  A lot of 
pe ople di ed on t he way.  A lot of 
people di ed on the wa y.  And we starte d to 
marc h on January 18, 1945 and we ca me t o  
Ravensbr uck.  I 'm thi nki ng ____
_______, I wr ot e down t he date 
somepl ace.  It 
escapes me now 
beca use  I ' m so, I ' m goi ng to 
gi ve you t he date s I  wr ote 
it down but not right now. 
Q: January 24? 

A: I t hink.  Six day mar ch, a ft er six da ys, oka y?  

Q: Were ther e people from a l ot 
of di fferent  barracks or was it j u
st your gr oup on t his march?  
A: There was lots of people.  
I don't know whether the wh ole camp
 or not beca use I don't know, 
what the case was.  But 
there was, you could see 
like marching very, very
 long.  And not until we  
wer e al most  Ger ma n , a nd the n t he y t o ok us  to this
, to Reve ns br uck.  We  arri ved to Rave nsbr uc k. 
Q: Okay.  On the march, did t hey
 gi ve you any food?  
Di d you stay someplace 
at ni ght?  Did you 
sleep?  

A: We  had to walk.  Wa lk and 
walk.  Not until we were
 already on the Germ
an soil, and I don't  
know e xac tl y what s pot i t  was , the n t here was li ke 
some trucks that picked 
us up.  And on the truc k 
on the way we fell asleep, 
standing, sitting, in anypl
ace.  But while you walked
 you had to stay alive 
and to be si l ent, to be Buncho ( ph)  t h e Silent . 

Q: Di d the y give  you 
any bread or anything? 
A: Not while we were walk
ing.  Some  pe
ople had a little piece, pe
ople died of thirst, 
of cold.  It was 
so col d and wit h the cl ogs, wit h th
e fr ozen feet .  And by that ti me 
we wer e skel etons.  Most of us  
was more dead than alive.
  If it would take a 
little longer we probably 
would not have
 made it. 
Q: Was it all wome
n on t he ma rch?  

A: I mar che d wit h all wo men .  Ma y be the r e wer e me
n too but when t hey chas
ed us out of the camp 
fr om the rest it was, I mo stly sa
w wome n.  Ma ybe  me n ca me t oo but wh
en they took us
 out we wer e  
all women. 

Q: And you were wi
t h your fri end?  
A: Yes .  Fort unat ely she ma de  the  ma rch.
  And then we  came
 t o Ra vensbr uck. 
Q: Oh I know, there was one other 
questi on I did want  to as k you. 
 As  you were marching did you 
notic e a ny of  the  local pe ople  al ong t h e way?  

A: I didn't notice a nyt hing.  I was j ust  having one th
ing in mi nd, the only thin
g I looke d if Binna is  
still wa lki ng with me .  That was my
 concern a nd if they ot her  girl
s, i f nobody i s, and I  knew wi th 
the last strength, I don't 
know w
ith wh at strength 
I , I re me mbe r e d my mot her 's wor ds, " S o meti mes a  
ma n is stronger
 than I am." 

Q: I just  wondered if 
people saw you marching?  

A: This I don't know.  I wa s too 
i nvolve d, t o ma ke sure that I 
can ma ke i t , you know, when you  
we nt so long.

Q: So what happened when 
you arrived at Ravensbruck?  
A: We arrived at Ra vens bruc k, t hat 's a date t hat 
I also wr ote but right now 
I 'm so upset , whe n I ' m 
thinking a bout t his  Cana da, t he  ___________, t he searc h. 
Q: I t hink you've said t hat  you we

th
 we wer e chased and t hen we ca
me si x da ys lat er, the si x-da y 
mar ch, and t hen we 
came in February 11
th
.  And there wa s a l so, t his 
was the only concentration  
ca mp, deat h ca mp, on Ge r ma n soil
 tha t ha s al so ga s c ha mbers. 
Q: Rave ns br uck?  

A: Rave ns br uck. 

Q: And you were 
there for two or  three weeks? 
A: Yes .  

Q: Wh at was it like? 

A: What was it like?  Same
 kind of suffering, same kind of su
ffering still.  They 
still didn't let go.  
And I ma de a ste w a nd Est h
er dead.  The y took us, t his ti me  we
 didn't have t o walk already, t he y  
took us wit h trucks.  And they 
brought  us to a not he r concentr ati
on ca mp in Malchow, Ger many.  I n  
the Malc how, Ger ma n y t h ey ha d no ga s c ha mbers . 

Q: You di dn't wor k i n Ra vensbr uck di d you?  

A: No t ver y mu ch .  It wa
s not  a long t i me .  It wa
s already c onfusion.  Did 
some work but it was not  
already as extensi ve as
 it wa s i n Ausc hwi t z. 
Q: So i n t he  dayti me?  

A: We  di d work but , yes we did 
work.  I ' m trying to
 thi nk beca us e I know I worke d i n a n  
a mmuni tion fa ctor y, but t hat
 was in Malchow.  Because I reme mb er
 we sabotaged a lot of the things  
there. 

Q: So, in Ra vensbr uck during t he da y . . .?  
A: We  di d work.  I don't 
remember exactl y what  t
ype of wor k we di d t he r e.  To an a m muniti on  
fa ctor y or s o methi ng.  The r e was not a ny Ca nada 
or anyt hing like t hi s here a nymore.  I don't  
re me mber.  I  don't ha ve t hat many be caus e Ausc
hwitz , ot her t owers , ever ything ___________, t his  
is why I , t he  other s i s, but  
I know that there wa
s crematoriums.  I was less shielded. 
Q: Do you re me mber  a ny striki ng di ffe re
nce s bet we en Ra ve ns br uck a nd Aus chwitz?  
A: It wa sn't as huge .  
I didn't hear the orchestr a playing so 
that was the, and th
er e wasn't so many 
people .  And I didn't stay so long so t here I ha ve
, when I speak even though I was t here but I must  
not speak of Auschwitz
 because that 's where, i t was the last day when I 
came wit h family, t hat was  
the la st da y on e arth for my e n
tire  fa mi ly.  Thousa nds of Je ws
 fr om the ghetto No ve Mesto 
including my friends and relatives
.  And the firs t day of ______
________, that 's why Aus chwitz  
was the worst of it, Birken
au, t hat  was the wor st. 
Q: Well  of c ours e, and you als o 
wer e  ther e much l onger.  I  was 
just  tr ying t o get a pictur e. 
A: Yes, we did work but I don't, 
I remember that after th
at, after Auschwitz, I 
no longer worked on 
the outs i de  c o mmando.  So 
it must either an a mmun
iti on fact ory or  s o mething.
  To be  very hone st  
with you I don't reme mb er because 
I didn't st ay that long there. 
 But I know that there was gas 
chambers and I know th
ey wo uldn't just sit 
a nd not  do a nyt hing. 
Q: And the people , the other pri son
er s who were t here when you arri
ved, they looked pretty much 
like the people at Auschwitz? 
 They were thin and sick? 
A: Not ever ybody, not ever
ybody bec ause  it de pended on t he l e ngt h 
of time .  That ha
d a lot to do, it 
depended on the physical strength of
 a person.  Some we re
, not j ust _______ pe
ople but they were

fortunate t he y didn't get s i ck be cause i f you got si c k
 it 's t he end.  I don't re me mber Ra ve nsbr uk ( ph)  
in as many details but I know it wa
s, the people there was more Polis
h pe ople in Ra ve nsbruk (ph) . 
A lot of Polish people an
d some were a little older to
o.  So it seems like th
ey allowed older people  
maybe more there to come. 
Q: So t he n t hey took you to Malc how? 

A: And they took  and br ought me 
to Malchow.  And I came there with
 Bi nna too.  A
nd there, to my 
recollection, there was no gas ch
amb ers anymore.  We  
still were treated ba
dly, we still had little 
food.  The only good bet t er thi
ng wa s, a nd we  went e ver y da y to
 work, a nd t he c ondi tions  wer e  
horri ble .  The only bett er thi ng wa s  for me per s
onally, fo r Binna, that 
we didn't  work out side . 
Bec ause out side , winter or summe r , wit hout clot hes ,
 the proper clot hes wi thout.  That wa s, a nd we  
worke d insi de a nd we , t here I r e
me mber e xactl y what , a n a m muniti on factor y.  And I know that  
they gonna use this ammunition 
ma ybe  agains t us or other  peopl e 
s o whene ver we  c oul d sa bot age  
somet hing we di d. 

Q: Ho w?  

A: Ho w?   You k no w , lik e if
 you™re s uppos e to put it on thi s way you put it  in the oppos ite.  I didn't  
have any tools or a nyt hing to s abotage it but not t o
 do it .  And if you could 
wor k sl o wer  we wo rke d  
slower , you know, the pr oductions .  
And we kne w, whate ver we ca n we 
di dn't wa nt to do to help the 
Nazis.  To help 
t hem to succeed. 
Q: Wa s anybody, of the prisoner s, 
ki nd of orga ni zing t his?   Sort of advisi ng pe ople what to do?   Or  
you j ust thought  thi s
 up on your own? 

A: With  wh a t ? 

Q: Withthe sabotage. 

A: That was  a pretty vei l ed conce pti on.  We all 
wa nte d all the ti me but 
what could we do?   We 
coul dn't.  In Ausc hwitz I  coul
dn't, what c oul d I  sa bota ge?  

Q: But here did people t alk about it?   Did t hey
, when you were ne w t her
e did people  who were  
already ther e make suggestions 
or you just fi gured it out? 
A: So me  wo rd wo uld get  
out a nd some we sa w othe
r pe ople doi ng it .  It wa
s not disc uss e d, we we re  
afr aid t o talk.  You know, some
body, you ne ver kne w who c a n hear 
us or somet hing.  But we sa w 
that whe ne v er we c oul d, not to do proper l y or s o methi ng, then we did it .  If it woul d be, I don't  

know.  Knowing my self, I don't know
, i f I had opportunity t o  da ma ge 
the Nazis, that I don't know if 
I could do.  But the things that
 helped them to k
ill people, that I did 
with good conscious. 
Q: And enjoyed doing it?  

A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost
 felt like a responsibility.  It fe
lt that, they used everything fo r 
destr ucti on, you know?   People can be cr eator s or 
de stroyer s of li fe.  Ever
yt hing c a n be us ed for 
good a nd e vi l .  That is t he  education, I wa s dre a min
g about a for mal educati o
n but I tell you, ther e is  
no substit ute  for pers onal  experi enc e.  And what t h
is experience in the concentrati on camp taught  
me no pr ofes sor, no te xt books,
 no sc hool c ould te a c
h me .  Bec a use t here  you ha d t he c o nse que nce s 

of your acti on.  When, l
earni ng, book learni ng is  i mporta nt but it does n 't  have consequences .  It's  

not  the  sa me thi ng.  It 's  one t hing t o re ad about  
slavery t han being a sl ave.
  It's  one thing about 
losing, i f some body lost
 a fa mily, than losing
 your own.  Sa me  t hin
g a bout s u ffering, about  
believing fr om t hat  my ancest ors 
were in Egypt, i ts di fferent when
 you go _________
 on yours . 
Then you know.  An d then some
thing ha ppe ns  insi de you.  De
pe ndi ng on your at t itude .  You  
become either bitter or better.  My
 mother's last words 
were not to become bitter and hateful and not 
to let them destro
y, and I realize this now.  Th
at hate is the 
most destr ucti ve t hing. 
Q: What el se  ca n you tell  me  a bout M alchow?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
41 
 
 
A: Well I can tell that Malchow? 
I just felt eve r yday, e ver yda y wa
s  like  you wa nt anot her le ase  on 
life.  I know that t he wor se the 
c ondit ion got  the  l onger it took.  
We  tried to enco
urage each ot her  
agai n, ma ybe tomorr ow, don't give 
up, hol d on.  That was li ke a __
_________, don't give up.  Don't  
give t he m t he vi ctor y, don't give
 the m t he fi nal  victory.  And 
we j ust we nt, we k n e w we  were  
trapped and we  were hoping for a mi
r acle.  And not knowing 
i f its  going t o  ha ppen.  It j ust went  on.  
Worked and anot her  
da y, anot her  da y, not  knowi n
g what's  going to happen. 
Q: Now at this point did 
you ha ve  a lit t l e bit  more 
i n for ma tion a bout t he war ? 
A: No. 

Q: Still?  

A: We  didn't have contacts
 with anyone.  From 19
42, until I came to concen
tration camp.  Actually  
fr om the ghettos we knew
 nothing, until I came to 
the ghetto, before the ghe
tto I could 
still hear 
rumor s or s o met hing but nobody, 
we didn't have , who coul d tell us
?   The onl y pe ople that we sa w 
when I was i n concentr
ati on camp is t he i n
mates and the Nazis. 
Q: I j ust fi gured that maybe at 
t his poi nt you mi ght  have some  s e
nse t hat you ha d be en move d int o  
Ger ma n y . . .? 

A: No I didn't be cause I  didn't know.  Beca use , I  
had bee n told not to bui l d, not to as sume .  An 
assumpti on i s di ffer ent fr om a fact .  So I didn™t kno
w, s o I didn't make any a
ssumpti on.  I just hope d 
and pr aye d a nd trie
d to hold on for 
as long as I coul
d.  Tha t 's  all . 
Q: How long were you there? 

A: I was there until I wa
s liberated on, during Pa
ssover, April 26, 1945. 
Q: What happened? 

A: What ha ppe ne d?   That 's an int e resting story.
  I woke up one mornin
g.  No __________.  
Commotion.  And then the Swedish Re d Cross came 
to sa ve us.  Not eve r
ybody.  They took out  
mo stl y th os e  w ho  were  s i ck
 and by that time  I was pretty sic
k.  And Bi nna a nd I,
 a n d a  fe w othe r 
people , ther e was a gi rl, Fra nya Gil ma n ( ph) , s h
e wa s als o  on our tr uc k.  And ironicall y, bei ng 
decei ved by the Nazis about  
this, Red Cr oss.  When I  
saw thi s Red Cr oss I was 
afr aid to go up.  But  
you know, peopl e c onve y mes sa ges by words, by their  e m
otion, by the ir body la nguage.  And thos e  
people di dn't  see m like Nazis.  Firs
t of all , they di dn't wear the uni fo
rms.  And I felt th
at this is not, 
but at first t h ere was fear 
to go up.  But, s o they t o ok us on the trucks.  Fr om on the dat e that I gave 

you a nd t he war was st ill  going on be caus e it didn't fi ni
s h offic i ally.  So a bomb, a part of a bomb 
fell in our truck and it hit Fran
ya Gil ma n ( ph)  and Franya  Gil m
a n ( ph) ha d to ha ve her foot  
amput ated.  That was already towa
rd the end, on the way.  A
nd from there we traveled fr o m  
Ger ma n y t o via Cope nha gen. 

Q: I wa nt to ask you a que stio
n be fore you c ont inue .  When 
you say you sa w the Swe dis h Re d  
Cross, where were the Nazi
 guar ds?  Where were the 
Ger mans at t his point ? 
A: I didn't see the Nazis.  I don'
t know what's happened 
to t he m.  I di dn't se
e anybody.  All of a 
sudden I didn't see, in 
the commoti o n, we  di dn't
 know, something ______
_______.  A
nd fr ankly I  
didn't know wh at was going on.  I didn't know if 
I should be happy or sh
oul d be unhappy, I didn't
 
know what wa s goi ng on.  But 
t hen they came and they helped me.  
By that time I was pretty sick. 
And they helped me to come  to a truc k, they helped 
me up.  And we ca me t o, 
we traveled.  It took a 
whole  day.  At ni ght  I r e me mb
er  we wer e i n a  bar n, in Co
penhage n, Denmark, Cope nhage n. 
Q: Di d you t ake  a boat?  

A: No, no.  By bus. 
 Not  bus , by tr uc ks.  Tr uc ks a l so.  But not
 suc h a , not wit h 
Nazis anymore.  An d 
I didn't know what to think, I fe
lt sick and I didn't know alr
eady but I  sa w fr om t he wa y t hey  
touc he d us  beca use  t he Nazi s never woul d t
ouc h us beca use we  wer e full  of lice and

over  ni ght  i n a bar n.  And a fter t h
at the y brought us  to Lund, Sw
e de n.  A univer s
ity city, to a 
hos pital .  And I wa s ali ve  but  I ha
d no home to live in so the hospit
al,  the y gav e  me my  fi rst ho me  
aft er liber ati on.  But be fore we we nt in we ha d 
to strip a gain, na ke d, throw a wa y the tatter e d 
concentr ation camp shi ft, and we got
 a bed.  And aft er all those years,
 ne ar ly six years, I saw mysel f  
in front of t h e mi rr or .  I coul dn't
 spea k a lot of Swe dis h, or under s
ta nd.  I was statel ess, homele ss, 
penniles s, j o bless .  Unli ke my non-Je wis h fell ow su
rvi vors, I coul dn't go ba
c k  ho me t o  my fa mil y ,  
to my relatives, to my friends be
c ause Je wish home , Je wi sh fa mi l i
es and Jewish communiti es wer e  
destr oyed.  I  had no one left, t o he
l p me , to love me , to
 w a it for me, or t o mis s me .  B ut I mis sed 
terrible , ever ybody.  And I re me mber  the shock I  got
 when I saw mysel f for 
the first time in the  
mirror.  I didn't know my self. 
 I didn't see myself all those y
ears.  And it wa
s no sign of 
womanhood.  Another thing, during 
this Auschwitz I didn't
 get my period.  Un
til this day, I don't 
know the  rea sons why.  That
 wa s mal nutriti on or wh
ether they were putting 
something in the fo od?  
I would suspect its malnutrition.  
And I didn't know if I 
am going to be like a 
normal woman.  And 
when I sa w mysel f  in t he  mi r r or , I 
started to scream.  The nurses di
dn't know what's happened.  And 
I didn't know how to explain.  [e nd 
of side 1 of tape 4]   Anyhow
, I , it was a coi n
ci dence because I  
wa s bor n during Pass ove r  and I was l i berat ed duri ng 
Pass over.  And I ha d less, I had more on the  
day whe n I wa s bor n than the da y of liberat ion. 
 Not a tangible shred wa
s left of my pre- war  
childhood world.  Not a singl e do
cume nt, not a family an
nual, not a photograph
, nothi ng.  And t he  
Swedish people in the hosp
ital were very kind.  Very, ver y kin
d, very cari n g.  And t o me, i f I didn't 
get beaten t hat was already a luc
ky day.  Beca use the n I st a r ted to
 realiz e I didn't know anythi ng  
what was happen, 
with Hitler, I didn'
t know what's  Germany, I didn'
t know how the wa
r is.  I was 
away fro m t he war for nearly si x y
e a r s, not ha ving any contac t, isol
ated fr om t he whol e world.  Not  
readi ng, not knowi ng a nything.  I 
onl y kne w what  I se nse d, what I 
felt and what I, 
by comparison. 
And I talked to myself and I started to realize 
how one pers on can make a differe nce .   Thi s wa s 
Gentile people and this was Gentil
e people.  One destroyed so ma ny 
of my  people, the other saved 
the m.  And I  starte d to underst an
d ma ny, ma ny thi ngs .  Not i m me diat
e l y, because in t he  begi nni ng I  
wa s t oo sic k to t hink 
a nd it was  lonel y .  Bi nna fort
unat ely survi ved too.  At  
what poi nt I  realize d . . . 
Q: That you wer e a ctual l y fre e?  
A: Wh e n I wa s with t he  S wed ish R e
d Cross.  Then I st arted t o real
i ze, when we wer e  goi ng, whe n 
we ca me t o Cope nha ge n and I sa w that they tre at us
, it was li ke bet wee n ni ght and da y, the contra st. 
The y t r eat  us  ki ndl y, the  others  trea te
d us crue l.  They
 took care of us. 
Q: And you felt you were
 able to trust them? 
A: At  first  I was afraid to go
 because I didn't know
.  Wh at th
e Red Cr oss repr ese n ted t o me  
destr ucti on of so ma ny pe ople at first .  But the n I 
didn't see any Nazis.  I wasn't , I was naive, I was 
young but I wa sn't comp letely
 s t upid.  And I coul d see t hat , the di
ffer enc e  of the wa
y they treat ed us  
and, you know?  Th ey fed us. 

Q: What did it feel  
like, being liberated? 
A: It  was  a t r e mendous s hoc k, a 
tr emendous, t he t ransiti
on wa s not, I di dn't, all  the  ti me I drea mt 
about being fre e but the e very da y str u ggle t o s urvi ve,
 to get through the day, 
not to be put to the gas 
cha mbers , not to be mai me d, not t o be, healt h, a nd to
 li ve .  It was t he str u ggle t o sur vi ve so t hat yo u 
coul dn't thi n k about all t h e othe r things.  You we re
 with e ver ybody t ogethe r .  Many pe ople toget her, 
we were on t he sa me boat  like we use d to say.  Bu
t when we were liber ated, and when I came ther e,  

I coul dn't speak the la nguage.  I was  19 year s ol d. I coul dn't unde rsta nd a wor d of a nyt hing.  A  

stranger i n a strange worl d.  Not 
havi ng a nyone.  And all  
of a sudde n, i n t h e be ginning right a way I  
didn't e ve n t hink so muc h.  I wa s 
too sick, too tir ed, t he s hoc k was 
very much.  But t hen t he very

first time, I will ne
ver fo rget, but this was late
r, but I'm sharing now an 
experience when I  was the  
first time, or maybe I should
 go wh en I come  to it. 
Q: Okay. 
A: I was in the hospital th
ere.  I was getting good care.  The c
ontrast was a sharp 
contrast fr om the 
wa y t he Naz i s tre ated us here .  An
d  I  re me mb er  o ne t hin g I  w a s t hin
king, if this is, I remember I 
was seeing t he di fferences because I  always had th
e abilit y because I was crea
ti ve t o compare.  I  
said, "This is Gentiles and this is
 Gentiles."  So good an
d evil, no one has a mo no
poly on it.  It has 
more to do with th
e _____________. 
 With who you ar e as
 a human bei ng.  What you believe  about  
yoursel f, about God a nd about  ot her s
.  That e f fe cts your behavior .  
An d therefore, I realized even 
mo re wh at my  mot her 's  last wor ds , don 't bec o me 
hateful and bitter, don't 
let the m destroy you, I 
realized what tragedies and hatred is.  And th
e more the Nazis t ortur
ed me, the more I was 
deter mi ne d never t o bec o me li ke  the m, t o vie w 
myself through their eyes
.  And here  I s aw ki nd  
people .  I  ha d a ver y, ve r y wonder
ful me mo ries.  Very, very grateful
 to the  Swe dis h pe ople , t he wa y 
they helped me.  They helped me
 to get on my feet.  I have not hi
ng.  I ca me in, like I said, I ha d 
more on the day I was born.  He re I went in the hosp
ital, I came in nude becau
s e the y coul dn't allow 
this filthy dr ess to c o me  in this her e , the firs
t t hi ng, we c a m e in and t ook the showe r s and t hey 
helped me to bathe, cove
red, nurse me back to heal
th.  And for this I will be
 always grateful because  
I learne d not  to take a nyone or a nyt hi ng for gra nte d. 
 Because i t s ver y easy to
 lose everything.  And 
we  stayed in the ho spital
 and then, I think I gave 
you all  the date s, ri ght?  
Q: Well I don't know . . . 

A: Ot her wi s e I ha ve eve r ythi ng, I  ha ve it all writ te n down. 

Q: I don't know how lo
ng you were in the hospita
l, I just know 
t hat  you a rrive d i n Lund on Apr i l  
28
th
. 
A: Right.  Because on t h e 26
th
 I was l i berat ed.  On the 27
th
 I wa s in Cope nha gen.  The 28
th
 I arrived .  
And at that t i me, when I  started t o get healt hy I 
starte d to e x a mi ne a nd t o re-e valuat e ever ythi ng. 
What is it?  Who is re sponsible?  
And ba sicall y what I wa s i ntere sted
 is, in the begi
nning, t o re ga in 
my health.  I started con
centrating on regaini ng my 
health because I real ize 
that heal th is weal th, 
healt h is i mportant because if yo
u™re sick a nd you are alone , you ca
nnot do very mu
c h.  And I was  
very much awar e that I no
 longer have anyone to 
love me , t o prote c t me , to
 take care of me.  So I  
nee ded t o be come my own pare nt a nd start taki ng car
e of myse lf.  Of c our s e, Binna and I were st ill  
very de voted and very loyal t o e
ach other and we wer e 
each ot her 's fa mily at
 the time. 
 An d I  wa s  
there in t he hospital , I got ver y good care.  I al
so wa s always fortunatel y a good stude nt  and al ways  
love d la ngua ge, words.  I always r
ealized the power  of word
s, so I was ver y e age
r to learn Swedish. 
So while there, I started, 
they were  ve ry ki nd to me
, t hey gave  me  a dicti onary a nd I sta rted t o le arn 

a little bit.  And to 
recover.  And I was 
in Lund, Sweden until 
May 7, 1945.  From
 there I was sent 
to Dod-ug-st up ( ph)  in Swe den.  It 's  called Do
d- ug-st up (ph), it 's ____
________ you 
know?   And  
this was DP Camp, which in Swed
i s h is  cal led _________
_____.  On Ri nks- va gen
 ( p h) 20 B, t hat  
was the address.  No
w there we were in a quarantine, we s
till couldn't go out 
because the people 
wer e  a frai d,  if we  are , i f we d
on't  car ry any dise a ses or, so we we
re not t r eated ba dly, in fac t  we  
wer e tre ated ver y nice .  However , we only got 50
 cents a week, it 's 50 __
______, whi ch i s like 50  
cents  here, for poc ket  mone y.  And we  start ed, t he pe
ople fr om the town  came  
to the, ther
e was al so 
a fe nce , but wa s not bar bed wire s,
 it  was not ele ctroc ute d wi res, 
a nd we would come  to the fe nce  
and they looked.  Some 
ca me and we would gi ve the m some ti
me s the mone y and as k the m to buy 
little trinkets for us.  And there 
was a couple with a young son, mu
st have been ma
ybe early 20's, 
and with the fe w words that I coul
d speak we made contac
t.  I already recovered a little bit, looked a 
little better.  And I didn't think of 
myself at that time 
as a woman yet, but ob
viously he thought of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
44 
 
 
me that way, and he asked me, a nd i n the br oke n 
Swe dis h wi th the dict ionary, I unde rstood that  
when I get allowed, when 
I will be allowed to get 
out fr om the quarantine, 
will I go on a date with 
hi m.  And that wa s the fi r s
t date of my life, okay? 
 So I wa s ver y exci ted a n d anxious .  I didn't know  
how I 'm goi ng to know how to beha ve
 with a man, I di dn't s ee a man 
for  all thos e ye ars.  I di dn't  
have a ny experie nce  in dating an
d mati ng.  I we nt out  wi th hi m.
  It  wa s a  ve ry, ver y pai n ful 
experience for me.  Because as s
oon as we started to
 talk, and not very 
much, he  paid me a  
compli ment , you don't look Je wi sh.  
And that wa s like a kni f e in my, 
t wi sted in my heart.  Here I  
suffer ed so much an
d I ' m not  Je wi s h?   And agai n, he does n't s
ee me  as  a huma n bei
ng.  Ye s, I'm not 
denying my Jewishness, I'
m proud to be who I am.  Wo uld I be
 born a Gentile, I w
ould be proud to  
be Gentil e, but I 'm born, I didn't make choic es about
 thi s.  It hit me s o har d, and I don™ t believe he  
me ant it i n a  bad wa y, i n  a ma li cious wa y.  He wa
s a kind pe rs on.  But fo
r some how he  re mi nded 
me who I a m, not t hat I  ever for
got it.  And I sa id, " Good- bye."  
Excuse my self with tears in my  
eyes and I left .  And I made a 
decision.  Never will I go out wi
th somebody who 
is not Jewish 
beca use I ' m the onl y link left , the onl y daught er le ft 
of my fa mily.  I cannot  do 
it to my fa mily or to 
my  people or to myself.  An d 
in our  camp there, in the DP Ca
mp , was a woman which was called ,  
we calle d he r ____________
_____, me ans  she was a 
Ra bbi 's wi fe , s o the hus ba nd i s  a Ra bbi , s he is 
the Ra bbi 's  wi fe .  So sh
e was  the Rabbi 's  wi fe  a nd she wa s orth
odox and s he  took a  gre at i ntere st , 
she want ed t he chil dre n, t hos e who ar e under 21, to 
re main Je wis h.  So she took us, s h e told us ther e 
is a camp t h at she wanted to take
 us .  Also, we wer e not stil l comp
letely free to go.  A kosher, a 
camp .  It wa s no, it wa s, I prefer 
kosher to not kosher of
 course at that  ti me, 
but  it wa s n 't  so much 
the kosher  because i n t he concentrat
i o n camp I  ate not  kosher , so, but 
it  was that I felt I  need t o be 
with Jewish people. 

Q: The DP Ca mp was mi xed?  

A: Th e DP Ca mp  wa s onl y Je wi sh ,  but  whe n  I  we
nt out , a nd he t e lls me  thi s here , I wa s t oo  
wounde d ye t from the whol
e exper ience.  Maybe i f
 he would sa y t oda y I 
woul d l a ugh it off, it  
wouldn't even have mattered to me 
thi s mu ch.  But  at that ti me , I 
wanted to be accepted for who I  
am because I realized by that time
, if I cannot be accepted for who I 
am surely I will 
not be accepted 
for what I am not.  So I  want ed somebody t o a
ccept me for , it 's not that  I had anything about a 
Gentile or anything, but I 
wanted to be, I needed to
 be among my people who 
are Jewish in order to 
know tha t I don't , s houldn't be t o
ld you don™t l ook Je wi
sh, or  be a cce pte d  
for who I  a m.  So I  
vol unte ere d to go to the ca mp.  An
d on Jul y 10, 1945 I le
ft ____________ and I went  to Hel-s hin-
fel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called.  However , there 
was s o met h ing whi c h was troubli ng 
me .  I wante d Bi nna to c o me too. 
 I didn't wa nt t o separate .  I t
hought of Binna as my exte nded 
fa mi ly.  The  Rabbi 's wi fe said, "I
tka, I don't want  to sepa
rate you 
fr om your friend, but I can't  ta ke  
her.  Not now at least.  Becaus
e I ca nnot make e xce ptions."  And 
she was three years older so she  
coul d no l onger go.  But sh
e said, "I  give  you my  word that  a f te
r a few weeks, I will  bring her t oo. 
But  not right  now beca us e the n I c a
nnot gi ve __________ a bout this ."  
So I deci ded to go and I t old 
Binna  that  I 'm goi ng to t r
y to ma ke s ure t hat she 
comes  late r.  And the  Ra bbi 's wi fe c e rtainl y kept  
her pro mise  and s he brought  Binna t h ere t oo. 

Q: Now I  ha ve a que stion about  
act ual l y bot h of t h ese ca mps. 
A: T he DP  C a mps?  

Q: Ri ght .  Because I ' m curious wh
o organized t h em and 
supported them?  And 
also, what sort of 
activit y we nt  on 
in them?   They were trying 
t o, I think, rest or e pe opl e.  We re t here  fa mi l y tr aci n g 
servi ces?   Di d t hey have  r eligious
 ser v ices?  I n t hese DP ca mps?  
A: I n t he fi r st camp t her e was ha
r dl y a nyt hing.  There was just t h
e emphasis on restoring us to 
healt h.  Even when I came t her e,
 I wa s not physically that strong
 yet.  So the emphasis was on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
45 
 
 
restoring, to get us used
 t o a nor mal li fe , i f you ca n call it nor
mal .  And s o  there wa s not muc h, w e  
reste d basi ca lly.  We di dn't do ver y much.  It wa
s more re c uper ating.  I t  was li ke a convale sce nt 
home you woul d go fr om a 
hospital , t hat sense, except better becau
se we were already, we wer e not  
invali ds . 
Q: Any religi
ous  se rvic es ? 
A: No. Not at that point. 
 Nothing yet.  At 
that point it was just plain st
art putting us 
a little in the,  
now when I ca me to He m-
s he d (ph), we obs erve d strictl y the  Sh
a bbat.  I n  fa ct, Mr . Pound (ph) wa s  
the na me of the __________ and he
 coul d only s pea k Swe dis h.  He wa s t he, i n Swedi sh was t he  
____________.  This was 
like the ma nger, like  the, what ever
 you c all it, when s o mebody is in  
charge of.  He  couldn't sp
ea k a si ngl e wor d of ot her l a ngua ge , j u
st Swe dis h.  So he  as ked, "Is  ther e  
anyone who can speak Swedi sh a li ttle? "  _______
__________________.  I learned quic kly th e 

langua ge.  While I was there , I wa
s always wit h the dict ionar y and 
tryi ng to lear n the l angua ge.  So 
he, I beca me  his hel per i n  the offic e.  I  had no trai ni

I wasn't asked to do any 
office work.  My job consisted ba
sically, t ranslati ng.  
I f some body c a me i n an

We got sheets and pi llow cases and 
things like this fr om

would be in char ge of t hi s her e. 
 I f some body, bas i cally

but no office work 
beca use I  ha d no tr aining i n this  her e. 
Q: Who supporte d t he se ca mps?  

A: I have no idea.  
At that time I didn't know, 
I was still not havi

the normal world but it wasn't yet 
a nor mal li fe for me, it wa s  not.  So
 I woul d rather not sa y and te ll 
you s o met hi ng whic h I have no kn

it mu st have been, I don't know.  No w I'm 
aski ng, I ' m glad you™re  as king t
hos e questi on be ca use  maybe  I 'm goin
g t o a sk around t o fi nd out. 
Q: It ma y be  _______

A: Yeah, it c oul d be somebo
dy, ma ybe the Re d Cr oss  or
 ma ybe the Swedish . . . 
Q: Or t he World Jewi sh
 Congr ess , or  . . . 
A: Ye ah, s o me body.  Bu
t who?  I don't know at th
at ti me .  But we had good 
meal s.  It wa s in a ver y 
nice place, physi call y it wa
s a nice place, nice surroundi

eens and i t felt good. 
Whe n we ca me  the r e we  didn't  have  anyt hing.  
Everybody got a suit case
, the sa me  ki nd, a nd a 
change of clothes next to
 what we were wearing. 
 And sheets, pillow cases, 
soaps, towels, this we 
got fr om the r e.  And I wa s worki ng th
ere and t hen at one point , I start 
t o feel  that I no l onger want to  
be in coll ecti ve li fe.  I 
want to start a life  on 
my own because when it s co
llective, it ha
s advantages, 
but it has the  disa dva nta g e.  You don't  devel op an i d
entit y as much.  I nee de d to sta r t a fi eld, buil d a  
life.  So Bi nna a nd a not her girl , Regi na Sha piro 
( ph) , who wa s ther e als o, we we re as si gne d to go, 

we got our fi rst job.  And 
this, I didn't have 
any, I was 19 years old.  I 
had no marketable skills and 
onl y seven grade of publ ic school and a fe w gr ades 
of Hebre w
 sc hool.  So I didn't ha ve, I ha d t o  
take whate v er job t hey would gi

 Nove mber 18, 1945 I

called Re dla nd- da ( ph)

 At that time I didn't know where its

Q: You had complete freedom to

me we coul d leave.  That
 was because when 
I came ther e in

was i n  
July and we we nt on Nove mber 18

Q: Let me a sk you s o me thing, did you thi nk the r

A: Not once .  I knew t hat  they di dn't.  I kne w th

doe sn't . . . 
Q: Not i mmediate  fa mil y  but you 
had a lot  of c ousi ns and . . . 
A: I didn't go to Poland.  I didn
't have the means, I didn™t ha ve the stre ngt h, I didn't ha ve the know-
how, I didn't  have t he mone y, I didn'
t have anything.  I just s t aye d, 
this is why later, towards the  
end, I ' m goi ng t o just ma ke a su
mma t ion a nd you are going t o see wh
y I realized that
, I'll talk about 
this l ater bec ause  then i t s goi ng t o
 ma ke mo re sense than now.  An y
h o w, s o wh en we we nt t o wo r k  
here, we came, th
at was my first job.  Free
dom by choice.  Un
til that date, whatev
er I did is where 
they se nt me , e ven to 
go into ___________
__, t o the kos her  _
__________, the DP
 ca mp.  I don't  
know if we didn't call it, we called 
it  ______________
.  I didn™t even know th
at it exist, DP camp,  
so I was still cut off of the wo
rld.  I had no communic
ation because I wasn't
 on my own, I didn't 
have a ny r adio, I  di dn't have , you know t hose t hings, 
pa per s a n d thi ngs.  I c oul dn't re ad t oo wel l  yet  
to be abl e to under sta nd, so it wa s pre tty tough stil l.  And whe n I ca me 
to __________
___, on my 
first job I had a very traumatic experience.  
I came willing to except
 any job providing its 
respe cta ble.  I was deter mi ned, i f
 I survi ved Auschwitz 
with dignity I will not
, I was determined o n  
three t hings not to give up, on 
my li fe , on my ________
___ a n d on my free dom. 
 Because I realized 
without it life is not worth living fo
r me.  And I came ther e, there wa
s basically a very tiny village.  
There was a sanat ori um for children 
wit h TB.  And most of
 the inhabitants ther
e, I don't know how 
mu ch the population, were people
 who were elderly pe ople .  Si ngl e, elde rly people .  The r e wa s  

very, I don't  think there wa s anyb
ody my age there.  But at that
 time I didn't think about those  
things.  I was just gr ateful a
nd why I accepted t he j
ob also because it was 
room and board and I  
would still get paid a little.  And I need that to have
 because that was, I didn
't have a home still.  I 
didn't  ha ve  a n a part me nt  or a nyt hing on my own yet. 

Q: How did you fi nd 
out about this job? 
A: Mr . Pound helped me
 out .  Mr. Pound li ked me  a lot.  In fa c t , he sai d to me , we got t o know each  
other a nd he liked me a lot and he s aid, "Itka, i f th
i s doe sn't work out you come
 back t o me .  I have a  
wife and children a
nd we'll take you in until you 
get on your fe et."  He was very nice.  He was not 
interested in me as a wo
ma n, he  was  inter este d a s a huma n be
ing, to help me.  He saw me as a 
homel ess c hi l d.  And he offere d, but
 I was determined to make it on 
my own.  And we we nt ther e, 
and t he gene ral boss wa s a ver y ni ce 
wo ma n .   She  wo ul d so me
time s invite me for 
a wal k, t o go with 
her, she would help me a little with
 Swedish.  Anyone 
who didn't help 
me was nice to me then, you 
know?   The  comparis ons, 
you know?   Tha
t 's  what
 I said, when you hear
d me saying a reference 
with which to co mpar e.  And she took me into the 
kitc he n, as signed me  to work i n t he kitchen.  I n  
contr a st , the  woma n who wa s the ma na ger of the 
kitc he n, she wa s the gener al mana ger.  The 
woma n who was i n the kitche n for 
no appa rent r ea son hate d me wit h
 a passion.  Fr om the mo me nt 
she brought me  in.  Why?  I have
 no idea and it doesn't sur pri se me
.  Half of the 
world hated me, 
that I  di dn't care and I survived, 
so I didn't worry about 
it anymore.  However,
 s he ass i gne d me  t o  
her a nd one day the ge ne ral boss sai d to me , "M ake 
the sa ndwi ches ."  As s o on a s s he l e ft , s he would 
say, "Scrub the floor" , or do s o met hi ng t hat was 
not a s eas y or as good a s
 the othe r j ob.  But I  
fi gured, I came 
here to work and I'm 
going to do what they
 tell me until I'm able 
to get on my fe et 
and then I'll see.  And I 
worke d t here  and I got pa
id, not  too much.  And Bi
nna , Re gina  and I s hare d  
one room and we got room and boar
d.  One da y was my hal f  a day 
off and I wa s going to leave and 
they bur st fr om the kitc hen, ma de
 like "Don't go! "  And a ll of a 
sudden I  had a flas hbac k fro m  
concentration camp and I 
was getting nervous. 
 And I very politely ask, "Wh y
 not?"  "There are still

dishes", she answered.  An
d I said, "There will always be dishes
 in our hospital, 
but it's my half a 
day off."  Be caus e I wa s t hinking, i f s he would ha ve
 as ked me I would have  gladl y sta ye d.  Beca use  
then I have a choice.  But  when I 'm or dered I have
 no choice.  And i f I acce
pt it once, the begi nni ng  
is the most import
ant, than I'm going to
 have to do it all the time.  A
nd I 'll  lose  my free dom and I 'm  
not ready to, after Auschwitz
, never again will I give 
up my freedom willingly. 
Q: Were you afraid to say no?  
A: Nope .  And I marc he d out .  Afte
r Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anyt
hi ng.  Just to do s o methi ng t o  

disgr ace my sel f or my fa
mi l y.  Ot her things I ' m 
not afraid.  What can sc
are me aft er  Auschwitz? 
And a s s oon as I wal ke d out , and 
I ca me to my  ro o m, t his so- c a
lled good mana ger c o me s in a nd she 
says  to me , "Itka , I hear d what 's
 ha ppened.  But would 
you do it for me?   Go
 ba ck? "  And I ha d 
mi xed fe elings.  The he a r t said one t hing, the hea d 
said a not her.  But I we nt bac k.  Wa lking on the  
wa y, e ver ything in me r e volte d.  I sai d, "I 'm sorr y, I can't do it."  I starte d to cry a nd I r un back i n  

and I di dn't go in.  I  ha d been t a
ught as a child t hat ne
ver ma ke serious deci s i on, long range decisi on  

when you™r e  under  e moti onal  str ain
.  So I told myself, 
I said, s uppos e I  le ft ?  
 Wher e a m  I goi ng to 
go?   I have no home .  The only opti on is t o go t o 
Mr. Pound and I don't wa nt 
to do that.  To be a 
bur den for  the m.  What future i s t her
e for me?  It al so mean
t  to l eave Binna, t o se
parate from Binna. 
Because I didn't dare ask her, co
me  wit h me, when I have nothing 
to offe r.  Not a pla ce, not a n  
apart me nt , not a job.  So I said, no, 
I c an't do it .  So I went to t he go
od boss  and I told her how I fe el  
about it, and I said, "Listen.  I have no home a
nd no pla c e to go.  But I a m a s urvi vor of a  
concentration camp.  I go
t so much abuse that I 
promised that I 
will never allow an
ybody to abuse 
me a gai n or give up my freedom.  
So I will gladl y stay beca use  I 
don™ t ha ve any other pl ace to go. 
Give me any job.  I d
on't mi nd scrubbi ng t oilet .  J o b does n't sc
a r e me.  I was  worki ng car rying st one  
and t hings .  But I want t o be tr
eate d wit h di gnit y.  If some body 
wants so mething fr om me, let them 
ask.  And if I can I will gladly gi
ve, but I don't take orders anymor
e."  And she sai
d, "I'm sorry.  I 
would gl adl y do it but  s he has bee n 
worki ng for me for 36 ye
ars.  I can't afford 
to lose her."  After  
that I ha d no longer t o t hi nk.  So 
I figured, so agai n not justice.  It
's  j u s t  fo r  c o n v e n
ient  for me.  At 
that point I said, whatever is involve
d, wh atever risk, I mu st take it.  
I went in with tears in my eyes , 
I said good- bye t o bot h my friends . 
 The y di dn't offer to c o me and I 
di dn't ask the m.  
At that time I 
didn't e ven c onsi der , I di dn't eve n, now I a m t hin
king, how come I didn't offer to come Binna?  I 
wouldn't let  the m anyhow, but the y didn't .  You 
know, everythi ng we nt so
 fa st.  And I pic ke d  
mysel f up and I went .  Li ke
 Buncho ( ph) t he Sile nt.  We nt to 
t h e world wit h  no one , a n orpha n, wit h  
no one t o car e.  And when I  ca
me to the train, they asked 
me  where  do you wa nt t o go?

Q: At  t he l as t  tape you were getti ng 
ready to get on a tr
ain for  somewhere. 
A: Somewhere.  And when
 I ca me  t o t he tr ain, r unning not  wa
l king, bec ause  I want  to ma ke  the  
train.  I di dn't have t oo many belongi ngs to ta ke wi th
 me, I di dn't ha ve ver y 
much.  And I didn't even 
have ti me to buy t he ticke t at the offic e, at the st
ati on, but I boa r ded on the 
t r ain.  And the conduct or  
aske d me , " Where  are  you going? "  
I sai d, "To t he near est , l argest 
city."  Because I didn't know 
Sweden at t hat ti me, I ha
dn't bee n ar ound yet .  So he said, 
"Boss (ph)?  Boss 
(ph), Sweden?  You 
know Boss (ph)? "   I sai d, " Okay." 
 And that 's where I 
le ar ned.  When I ca me int o  Boss (ph) , 
Sweden, I di d not know a  single s
oul.  I had no home.  
An d all of a sudden it
 da wned on me .  Where  
am I going now?   No w I am completely alone.  No 
fa mil y, and not  even frie
nds .  M y t w o fri e nds ar e  
also without me.  Where am I goin
g to sleep?  Wh at am I going to do?  And I walked quite a while , 
mostly I was completely oblivious
 of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to  
realize my s i tuation, t hat I have nothi ng.  I ha ve 
no mone y.  I have no home.  I 'm a homeless pers on 
and I ' m all a l one .  Eve n as ba d as it wa s in c onc en
tration camp, I knew this
 is where I'm going t o  
sleep at ni ght.  He re, I don't ha ve
 anyt hing.  And I 
must admit  I  was concer ned.
  And a ll of a  sudden 
I looked up to Hea ven a nd I found mysel f pra yi ng.
  A nd I r e me mbe r  ex actly
 what I said, inside  
my self.  Dear Go d, I am all alone and I am helpless. 
 I 'm i n your ha nds.  Guide me .  I don't want t o  
do s o met hing to disgr ac e mysel f  
or my fa mil y.  And I 
had been wal king, I 
don't know how long, 
and t hen all of a sudden I though
t tha t  I hear s o mebody s ayi ng, " Yit-c ola ."  I said, a m  I losing my 
mi nd?   I'm heari ng voic es?   And again I hear re p
eati ng, "Yi t -cola ."  And I look around and a girl  
fr om concentration camp recogniz
e d me .  She li ved in Boss ( ph) .  And I tell her my st ory and she  
said, " D on't worry.  We 
are concent r ation camp survi vor s.  We 
can shar e whatever 
we  ha ve.  Come 
up."  And I s t aye d over ni ght .  She 
dir ected me how t o go
 to the unemployment 
office, the next day, 
and I we nt.  The y asked me , did you 
work before?  I tol d 
the m, yes .  Wh y di d you le ave?   I sai d, " I  
tell you the truth, there's 
no young pe ople .  And I  wa
nted to start a 
new life.  Th ere wa s nobody for  
me t o associ ate with."  
Wh ich was not a lie.  But 
that was not the onl y r eas
on because event uall y I 
would have left a nyhow.  But it didn't  dawn on me .  
She as ke d me to c o me bac k, that s h e 's going t o  

check out my story. 
 Bec ause I was n 't  use d to t ele phone s ye t 
because I didn't have 
a te l ephone.  And 
she checked out the st ory and when
 I ca me bac k, s he a sked me , " Why di d you tr y t o pr otect  her? "  
And I s aid, "List en.  I di dn't le av
e , I 'm not goi ng to gai n anyt hing
 by making her  
look ba d."   You  
know, my mana ger from the kitc he n.  
"I just don't have a future there.
  And I left for thi s  reason, but 

I also eventually would have left 
anyhow because there is no life fo
r me."  And I told
 her a little bit, 
not  muc h, but I t old he r t h at I ha ve
 two friends wh o stayed
 there and I wa nt to 
be with them, can she 
fi nd a j ob for me , for t he m too?   
And she did f
ind me a job.  Ho we
ver , in Sweden was a cust om.  
That you onl y, i f you worked for 
s o mebody t he y provide d you wit h a n
 apartment.  You paid for it 
but i f  you s t opped worki ng you no 
longer could use that apart ment.  
S o I we nt to  wor k an d,  whe n I  
had alrea dy a job for t he three of us, a nd a n a part m
e nt, I got i n touch wit h  my frie nds and I brought  
the m over.  Wit h Regi na  it didn't
 work out too well because t here 
was , two is oka y, four is oka y,  
three is a little part in our re
lationship.  Because Bi
nna and I, except fo
r underwear, shared  
ever ythi ng.  Eve n a f ter we were l i ber a ted.  It wa
sn't mi ne  and yours .  Mo
ne y, ti me , wor k.  She felt  
better i f she did for me , if I did be
tter I did for her.  So we were lik
e sister s.  Regi na wasn't , she was  
more, s he was a  nic e gir l  but , li ke , t his i s mi ne, 
this i s yours, and we we
re not accustom because 
even in Auschwitz we shar
e d.  So we deci ded t h at she 's going 
to ha ve for hersel
f a roo m.  So we  
were on the second floor, ______
_____ was also a little room.  So 
Binna and I shared
 one room, she  
shared another room.  In
 Sweden, t he cust om was the dinner  wa
s not in the evenin
g, it wa s during 
lunc hti me .  Since I wa s brought up i n Pola nd and 
there was no rea dy- ma de foods and ever ythi ng, s o 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435

I was still accustom to do, 
I knew a little bit 
how to cook becaus
e when I was at hom
e I used to help 
my __________ and my pare nt
s , you know?   Chop this
 and . . . so I kne w th
at my mot her trie d to 
teach me everythi ng
, what she could, and I woul d, we woul
d make meals toget h
er .  And ever y day 
somebody would 
go take turns, one 
day Binna would go and warm up 
the food a little early and I 
did, I had a day when I didn't feel 
s o  good she woul d hel p.  We wer e  
rea lly de vote d t o each other .  
And one da y, I was wa lking home 
from work and I was rushi ng. 
 I was always very fast and 
ener getic .  And bingo, I 'm on 
the  ground.  And I fe
el that fr om the el
bow, fr om the back, 
some body's helpi ng me
 up.  I t urn ar ound.  And 
it wa s a ma n.  I thanke d hi m a nd he st a r ts talki ng t o  
me and he notices t hat I  
have an accent.  And we
 star t tal king a nd he  ha d a n a cce nt too and we  
found out that we are both
 survivors of the Holocaus
t.  And he tells me that
 he lives on the same  
street , he a sked me  where  I li ved, I  
told hi m, the same str
eet.  But he li ves  in a hote l a nd I  was, I got  
a small apart ment.  He helped me
 home a nd he te lls me that hi s 
fa ther wa s, not 
a ___________, but  
you know li ke a sel f- ma d
e _____________, ________
____.  There use d to be
 a lot of people like  
home-made remedies an
d he was going to clean up
 my knees and bandage, I 
was still, even though I 
we nt through Aus chwitz , but I sti
ll was not the kind of girl that
 would le t hi m s ee my knees , you 
know?   So I said, no t ha nk you.  And I wa r med
 up the food and offere d 
hi m some food.  And he  
said it s me l l ed nice and ever ythi ng, 
a nd he sai d, " Oh, I  would gladl y 
pay t o have a me al like thi s."  
And I s aid, " I don™t run a  restau
rant .  However , i f you want t o 
have a home - ma de me al, duri ng t he  
wee k we wo rk, I d on 't h ave th e ti
me , but on Sunday you'r e wel come .
  Binna a nd I i s  going to be  
home.  You can come 
up and have  di nner  with us ."  His na me  
is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz 
(ph) , now he  calle d hi ms elf Abe. 
 And Avr u m Sc hmol-l ev-it z  (ph)  
started to come.  I don™t know 
how I should call it, to da
te me?  But he would come
 constantly visiting.  Sh
owed a great interest in 
me .  I liked hi m ver y much as a frie nd.  Very lo
yal, well de vote d, ca ring.  But I didn't ha ve an y 
fe elings for hi m ot her wi se.  And 
he wa s comi ng to our hom
e for al most a year .  
Now, at that time, 
they sent t o Sweden, when we 
came to Sweden, all th
e wome n were there. 
 ___________
_.  There  
wer e other women fr om Swe d
en too, that were surviv
ors.  But the men they se
nt i n other place s.  So 
there were only two men in
 our city.  So t here wa s  no pr os pect 
for some body to fi
nd, you know?   So 
ever ybody, Binna and everybody else
 is sa ying, "Itka , you're  so l u
c ky.  You ha ve a man who like s  
you so much."  And, I 
don™t know, I never tal k
e d wit h hi m about love bec ause I ce rtai nly di dn't love  
hi m.  I l ove d hi m a s a huma n being, a s a good pe
rs on, but  no ot her wi s e.  And I re me mber t hat  
Binna said, " Oh, I woul d be luck
y to f i nd a  man l i ke thi s."   And, 
"Why don't you ma rry him? "  And 
I said, " You like hi m, you mar ry 
hi m."  Anyhow, I di dn't mar r y 
hi m a nd Avra m, i n Yiddish we 
actuall y call ed hi m Avrum because we spoke Yi ddish, 
he  rece ived, found out  that  he has t w o si ster s  
who live in America, who 
survived.  I don™t know where, I don't 
know too mu ch abou
t those things. 
And t he y se nd hi m a  vi s a.  And I c o
uld ha ve gone wit h hi m to Amer
i ca but I  di d not  wa nt t o go. 
Bec ause I sa id, I ' m not  going to ne ga
te myself in any way.  If I'm 
goi ng to mar r y some one it 's  goin g 
to be some body who I have
 dee p fee lings  for .  Love not only 
as a fri end but a s a ______________. 
And anyhow, one ti me , Avru
m Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to 
our apar t ment and 
he tells me, he 
invites me to come 
to hi s a part me nt.  I got  so a ngry.  I  
said, "After knowing 
me so long don't you  
know I ' m not the ki nd of girl that doesn't go t o 
a ma n's apartment?"  You 
know, we wer e brought  
up, you had to be a virgin wh en 
you got  marrie d, it 's not li ke t oda
y, you know?   An d he said, "Sha-
sha, I'm not just i
nviting you.  I'm in
viting Binna too and ther
e are going to be ot
her people."  And I 
didn't know at that time  yet what
's, a nd I c a me.  And t his  wa s ei
t her  June  24, 19
46, yes, it wa s  
already 1946.  June 26 or
, I think it was June the 24
th
 in 1946, and I come  to 
t he pa rty a nd as I come  
in wit h Bi nna, ther e are lots of guest s , and I di dn
't know that this was the 
party for hi s, farewell  
party, good- bye  pa rty, bon voyage  
par ty.  He was l eavi ng for  Ameri ca.
  And as I come
 in a man sits

there and as soon as I lo
ok at him and he looks at
 me, he moves a 
little bit and 
makes room 
and says 
to me in Polish, "Please 
sit here ."  And I sit  down next  to hi
m,  a nd  fro m  the  first  mo me nt,  I care  
dee ply a bout  hi m.  And I  started t o get worried, wh
at about Binna?   And he, I found out late r that 
Avrum Schmol-le v-itz ( ph) and thi s ma n, a nd I 'l l  
tell you late r who he wa s, kne w eac h othe r fr om 
the same homet own and the 
man that this man came 
with was also fr om the 
sa me home town.  Fr om 
Bell- hot -off (ph) , Pola nd.  They'r

 other fr om home, they went 
fr om __________. 
 And found out  lat er that t here  wer e e ve n
 s o me cousins  als o bet wee n t hese  me n.  
And he, wha t  I found lat e r 
out , t hat he  kne w alre ady that I a m no
t going t o get invol ved wit h hi m so  
he said to hi s friend, "I f 
she cannot  be for me at least let  her be
 for you."  Because 
he considered me  
to be okay, I  don't know 
what he thought about me
, but he wa nted me to 
get a nic e  ma n.  And t he 
person t hat I  met ther e was Rockmi
el  Zygmuntowicz (ph), my hus ba nd
.  And a ft er, and he as k me  
can he  ta ke us home .  So I  sai d 
t o hi m, " Y ou ca me  with
 your frie nd.  Why do
n't you invite hi m too 
and we 'll go toget her? "   Bec ause I wante d for Bi nna to have some body, to
 ma ke ______________,  
you know how _______
________is , to be 
the ma tchma ker .  And he sai
d, "Okay."  And they wa nt 
to go upstairs and I said, "No, it's
 t oo late.  Aft er a certai n hour nob
ody c o mes to our  apa rt me nt ."  So 
he sai d, " Pr o mise me t h at you'r e goi ng to wai t  fo

ifts fr om morning until  
2:00 a nd fr om 2:00 t o 11: 00.  
That I'm going to wait.  He 
got a job and the other ma n wa s 
_____________ ___________
_, which turned out la
ter  to be Bi nna 's  husba nd.  And he s aid t o 
come, will we wait for him?
  And I agreed.  Any
how, I met him a couple of
 times and ___________  
____________ s tarte d to
 date Bi nna  t oo.  And on
e  ti me, Rockmiel  (ph) sa ys
 t o me, " D o you know a 
girl, her na me i s M anya Mo- nes- ka  (ph)? "  And I 
said, " B y sight  I don't kno
w much about her.  I 
just know she's a prett y girl.  That 's all  I know ab
out her , from sight .  Why 
are you a ski ng? "  And h e  
tells me that her brothe
r was with hi m from where 
he ca me from,  another city in Sweden, and he 
aske d hi m t o  meet his sist er.  He 
wa nt ed t o ma ke a  match.  He didn'
t tell me at the ti
me  t hough that  
he ga ve hi m a letter, he really wa
s trying to make a match.  So 
I said, "Why don't you go?"  An d 
Binna kic ks  me  under  the ta ble , s he sa id, " A re
 you cr az y?   You're goi ng t o se nd a cat for 
__________.  Yo

re goi ng t o se nd hi m to anothe

he likes her better, it's better he
 makes the choice now than lat er." 
 And s h e didn't like that so s he  
sent ____________________. 
 He c a me bac k and he said, " N ow 
we c an get engage d."   So a wee k 
later, a ft er I met hi m, I was engaged.  And on Ju
l y 13, 1946, be fore Avr u m Sc

to go t o America, we had a do

beca use  obvi ousl y I  love  my hus ba nd, we l ove d ea ch

le survivor of a large 
fa mi ly.  He wa s one of s e ve n.  Onl y one si ster di ed
 be fore t h e Holoc aust and t he rest of his fa mi ly  
didn't survive.  And I was the sole 
su rviv or o f my  fa mi ly
.  At least he had th

we ddi ng.  I didn't have one si ngl e person from 
my home town.  One si ngl

My fa mily .  An d I  re me mb ere d t hat wh en  my , w hen
 we lived in Check-hon-o

But fr om the geese and fr om

this was suppose to be for a trousseau

 And here I wa s  all alone. 
 I  had no one.  And it hi t

the week of vacation, because we didn't have 
enough money for 
the next week.  And on our  
honeymoon, we di dn't go anypla ce a nd we c ooke d 
a big pot of soup.  An
d for a whol e we ek, the  
four of us shared.  This was our condition in the be
ginning.  And yet, I've tr
ied to make a go of it 
and Binna a nd I  ma de a  s witc h.  I s hare d wit h 
her my apart ment and Ma
ndl e ( ph)  a nd Roc k miel  
(ph) shared a little apartment when
 they came fr om the 
other city.  So Binna
 went to live where 
Rockmi el ( p h) li ved with Me ndle  (p
h)  and M endle  (ph) mo
ve d in wit h me  a nd 
Bi nna mo ved out, in  
that little apartment. 
 You don't understand?  I 
had an apartment where I sh
ared with Bi
nna before I  
wa s marrie d .  Mendle ( ph) a nd 
Rockmiel ( ph)  came 
from anot her cit y and the y had a litt l e  
apart ment .  So when we got marri
e d, so Bi nna went to li ve with Mendle ( ph) , it wa s her hus ba nd . 
An d I  liv ed  wit h Ro ck
miel (ph).  But there is 
something that, it™s a curi
ous thing, be cause I l ear n a  
lot fr om pe ople.  Whe n a n e nga ge
me nt we  made, I didn't know too 
ma ny people .  So t here  was  onl y 
Binna and Mendle (ph), Ro ckmeil (
ph)  and I , Avra m, a nd t wo gi rls 
that  I met in Boss (ph) , that  I 
didn't know fr om before.  One girl
 tells, who was invite
d there, Rose Li ft-ka 
(ph) s he was calle d at 
that time , I don't know what's he
r , she  was mar r ie d, a nd s he was ve
r y anxi ous t o get married.  She 
was a l ot older and t here wa
sn't a ny boys  to ma rry, 
the gi rls were worried t h
at they won't fi nd, and 
not everybody wa nte d to mar r y out 
of their religion.  So anyhow, we
 had a ti ny room.  Al l there was  
in the room is two single beds, a 
ta ble and a c ouple  of c hair s.  I di
dn't even have a stove in the room 
so we went to going fr om the steps,
 to go up to the fi rst fl oor, I took
 a little, made a 
little curtain or 
drape a nd I bought a  hot  pl
at e.  And that 's how I  cooke d.  And 
fr om the s i nk t hat  we use d.  But  I  
wa s s atis fie d .  So I  went  out  to 
bring in the food. Anyhow, this girl says to
 me , I  introduce  my  
fiancée when we  got engaged, and 
s he says t o me , " Yit -col a (ph), 
he's not for you."  An d I said, 
" Why? "  And she s aid, " He 's t oo bi g 
a flirt."  And I think 
t o mysel f , wait a mi nute , I onl y de al with 
fa cts .  Ho w wo uld  sh e k no w wh at h e  is, she j ust  
met hi m?   She  would s ay 
he's not attractive, she  
can se e, but how ca n she kno
w he 's a flirt?   He 's never , she ne ve
r met hi m before .  So I j ust ignor ed. 
After we were married, my
 husband aske d me , " Are 
you good frie nds? "   And 
I said, "Just met her." 
But  I ha d no one else and 
I wanted somebody to be with us at
 our engage me nt.  So he  said, " Did 
you know that when you went out 
t o  ________, she invite d me t o 
come to her a part me nt without  
you? "  I 'm goi ng to c o ok for you, I 'm goi ng t o  do 
this .  And I thought  to my sel f , you s ee how 
important  is the thing for yourself.  To think wh
at pe ople sa y a nd us e your own c o mmon se nse .  
Thi s is why I 'm telli ng you t he st ory.  Anyhow, 
we were married and ev
entually my hus ba nd wa s  
worki ng ver y hard.  And Mendle  (
ph) told me  how hard 
he 's worki ng so I  wa
s upset about it so I 
we nt a nd I gave up the  job I had, 
whic h was
 that  I coul d have, beca use ,
 t hat  he shoul d be abl e to ge t  
a better job.  And I should get ap
artment, to get a little bigger apartm
ent.  And we were in Swede n  
and we didn't have anythi ng, we start e d wit hout a n ythi ng.  But we underst o
od that it™s a  begi nni ng 
and we wor ked har d.  And t he n i n
 1948, and for  a l ong 
ti me I was worri ed whet
her I'll be able to  
bear a chil d.  Because I di dn't ge
t the period yet for so long.  Fina
lly I got the  period.  And anyhow, 
we got an apart ment .  
An d you know, I'm telling y
ou t hose stor ies because I ' m seeing t h at all  over,  
in every country and in every relig
ion, and even in every home, ther
e can be people who are good or 
not so good.  So anyhow, we ha
d an apartment and this, in this
 house where I had t he apart ment  
fr om thi s la dy, I had anot her job,
 she told me  from the beginning 
that I'm not allowed to have any 
children in that home, in that 
pl ace.  Because t here were only 
li ving peopl e wit
hout children. 
Mostl y el der l y people.  And she pu
t in our apart me nt t wo be ds , singl
e beds.  And one  ti me, at ni ght , 
I hear  s o mebody is openi ng t he do or.  She ca me t o  check i f  we ar
e sl eepi ng toget her , and here I am 

mar ried.  And I al ways, I  don™t kn
ow so much about how 
I was  wh en I was  r e al 
young, but as far as 
I can re member, I was taught to thi
nk for mysel f and t o tr
ust mysel f .  And my par ent s a l wa ys gave 
me  confidence, you know, that I ha
d that, that I was able to trust 
mysel f .  So I fi gure d , let her sa y

what she wants.  I didn't argue, I 
didn't talk bac k.  And it s o ha ppe n 
that that's when
 I got pregna nt,  
in that place.  But I knew, as soon
 as it will be shown 
s he will  ma ke me  mi sera
ble.  So agai n, I had 
to switch because I didn't want it 
to have , to worr y, and 
s o me body hear , s o ma ny of my people wer e  
murde r ed.  And here , I had 
worried for so long, i f I'
ll be able to bear a chil
d.  Her e  I 'm pregna nt and 
somebody looki
ng down on me or not 
permitting me to 
have a child.  I need 
her permission?  So I  
started to look for an apartment to get, to keep 
t he movi ng a gain.  Anyh
ow, whe n, before , when I  
move d i nto anot her , wh
en I  was pr egnant I moved to anot
her a part me nt.  
An d I didn't know 
anyt hing about how t he human body wo
rks.  A woman's body.  An d the 
doctor just told me the date, 
when to expect.  And just told me 
two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's 
time to come. 
All t he ti me  my husba n d and I wa
s  rehear sing.  Where we goi ng to
 go?   Ho w we g oin g to g o?  
Everything.  It so happened he 
had still shift work.  And he left 
in the morning an
d I woke up and 
my wat er ba g broke but  at that ti me
 I  di dn't know that  I ha d a  wat e
r bag a n d I  di dn't
 know what it  
wa s.  I just sa w it 's not somet hin
g t hat 's, not, t h at I neve r had be fo
r e.  So I go i n, I  don't  ha ve a  
fri end, I don't ha ve a fa mil y, I don't  have anyone 
that li ves near t hat I c an as k.  So I go into a  
neighbor, t o ask her, wha t  does t hat
 me an?   She said, "I don't  know. 
 Go ask the doct or."  So she 's  
advi sing me to go a sk the  doct or.  My hus band is
 not home , I don™t ha ve a  telephone number .  And 
here I see somet hing is not right a nd I  don't know what it is.  So I take 
my bicycle and I'm goi ng on 
a bic ycle to ask t he doc t or.  And her e my wat er ba
g i s broke n.  And I  ca me 
to t he doctor a nd the y  
don't let me go home anymore.  In
 the  me a nti me , I 'm s howi ng you the di ffe r ent infl ue nce s, how on e  
thing influe nces t he othe r.  An
d i n t he me anti me , my husba n d m
eet s somebody i n t he street and 
they ask him, how is Yit-
cola (ph), a n d he tol d the m that I a m
 expecting the baby.  And here I wa s a  
little bit _________.  
Anyhow, and this was alread
y after he knew that I went on the bike to th e 
hos pital , t hat  the  water  bag broke .  And he  tell s he
r the stor y.  So she  sa ys
, "Well, if the water bag 
broke a nd t h e ba by's not bor n then t h e ba by cannot liv e."  In t he mea nti me , I gave  birt h to a healt hy  
boy a nd my hus ba nd come s to
 the hospital and he come s in, I s
ee the  unc ertaint y on his fac e.  He  
hol ds his  ha nds  behi nd his back a nd not a  s mil e, no 
emotion.  I said, "What's 
going on here? "  And I  
wa s wonderi ng.  No congratu
lati ons, no not hing.  So dista nt and co
ld?   I said, that 's not my hus ba nd.  
That 's not the ma n I know.  And I sa id to hi m, " M
istletov, we have a son."  And he get so excited  

and te ars are  in his e yes , and behi nd he ha d a bouqu
et of fl ower s but he wa
s afraid to show them 
because she told hi m the baby mi
ght not li ve, a nd he thought ma
ybe it was a mistake.  So I' m 
showing you, why am I tellin

 I had no experience.  I wa
s alone.  That when I 
nee ded s o me body, a  mot her, I nee d

nobody.  Yo u know
?  And my so n

draperies, to slip covers, to cu
st om ___________ and I wor k ed ve

because I could be home  wit h t he 
famil y.  Then I recei ve
d infor mati on t h at, fr
om t he _______, t hat 
we can go to Amer ica i f we want 
t o.  And I deci de d tha t  I 'm going t o
 talk with my husband, find o u t 
how he  feel s .  And we  both deci ded.
  We 're going to go to America. 
Q: Why did you wa nt t o come
 to America and l eave Sweden
?   Or not  go t o  Isra el?  
A: The y di dn't give me  a choice t o go t o Isra el. 
 If t hey woul d gi ve me
 a choice I  would go. 
Bec ause the y woul d ta ke  care of it , s o I ha d to 
go again where I was, the r eason why I was leavin g 
Sweden is because t here wa
s no synagogue.  Ther e wa
s, the few Jews 
t hat  wer e there, i f any, were 
assimilated.  And I 
felt I  sur vived as a Jew, I  
suffered as a Jew, 
I lost  my  fa mil y b e ca use  w e  we re  
Je wish.  And ort hodox or not or
t hodox, but I wa nt to give  my 
chil dren a Jewi sh education.  A 
___________ e ducation, not j ust 
the secular but 
a Je wis h education t o o.  I  want e d t o be, for  
instance, when my son ha
d t o be cir c umcise d we  had to bri ng 
a Rabbi fr om St ockholm.   Wh en we 
wa nt t o ha ve kosher me at we had t o  send it , by
 the time it comes after 
t hree da ys it s  no l onger  
kos her  i f you know t he  
laws  of __________. 
Q: But you c oul d have move d t o St oc khol m?  

A: No, we felt there is n
o, t hat there, we c oul d ha ve move d, it 's
 not so e a sy to mo
ve.  You have t o  
have a job, you ha ve to move , an
d you have t he circums t anc es.  
We had not hing, we starte d wit h 
nothing.  So  we decided, plus, I ju
st felt that t oo ma ny, you know, 
in Europe there 
we re to o ma n y  
painful me mories .  I f the y woul d ha
ve given me a  choi ce I s ur ely woul
d ha ve gone to Is rael and that  

ti me , but  I didn't have a  choi ce.  
They
 assigned me  to come Philad
el phia, so on Fe bruary 15, 1953  
we arrived to the United States and settled in Philadelphia,
 and we've lived there 
ever since.  During 
the time when we ca
me  here, I kne w t hat we  wa nt ed t o ha ve 
a  larger  fa mil y .  And we ha d t o ma ke  a  
choi ce.  And I knew t hat all life, from the morn
i ng you wake up until the time you go t o slee p, you  
ma ke choice s.  And I wa s 
also taught  that  every, i n every c
hoi ce there are conseq
ue nce s and t her e  
are le ss ons .  So I  ha d t o  put my val ue syst e m t o  wo
rk.  And I said one thing,
 i f I  ha ve c hil dren I  
don't want the m some body el
se to take , I wa nt  to be wit h the m.  I wa nt to, I di dn't ha ve that  
privil ege bec ause it was not of my c hoic e, my mo
ther woul d have want ed 
me , beca us e one of t he  
things whic h I re me mber ed, very di
stinctly, is that my mother put 
aside her, she want ed to be an 
actres s but s he put  a wa y.  And t he 
famil y was al ways firs
t .  And other t h ings  whi ch I  hea r d whe n I 
wa s ho me is  that my mo t her was 
pre g nant but she had a misca r riag
e a nd I wa s ver y 
much the chil d 
that she wa nted so much and I wa
s loved unconditionally by
 my parents.  And I felt I don't wa nt to 
deprive my children of that.  So 
we decided, my husband an
d I, as long as we 
can pay our bills, we'll

forego l uxur ies.  I would never a cce pt a ha ndout 
from anyone.  We worked 
hard work.  And I will 
stay home with t he chil dr en ____
______.  And the n i n 1956, Nove
mber  24, 1956, 
our s on Sa muel  
wa s born.  Again, I reme mb
er t hat when I  was going t o go t o 
Ameri ca people s aid, whe r e you goi ng  
to go wit h a  baby?   Or t he se as
, and how are you goi ng t o
 ma ke out?   I alwa ys
 had fai t h.  I sai d,  
listen, I'm nursing the baby.  So
 at least until I nurse him he's 
not going to starve.  And the n  
some how its  goi ng to 
work.  You cannot ha ve eve r
ythi ng mapped out e ver y 
inch of the way.  And  
we went .  It wa s di ffi cult .  I ca me her e.  I didn't  
know a single person in th
is country.  I didn't know 
a singl e wor d of Engli sh.  Agai n we had to adj ust , to
 start anew, to make adj u
st me nt, t o ma ke wor k. 
_____________, I was a lready skill
e d, I was alre ady a fa shi o n desi
gner but my husba nd ha d no 
marketable skills.  He wa
s working in a knitting 
factory making nylon st
ockings.  But he was 
willing to work and ta
ke it, we went fr om one, 
it was very hard be cause he got a jo
b here when we  
came t o Phil adel phia, he worked 
i n ___________. 
 By the time he came, 
t he _______ the chil dre n  
were asleep.  By the time he 
came home, they were 
already, they were s
till asleep, they were 
already asleep.  And I sa
id, no, this won't do.  
Because I will never put ma
terial possessions above 
spirit ual thi ngs , whic h we need.  So I encour age d hi m t o cha nge t h e job.  The r e was a n  
advertiseme nt.  After he worked 
a fe w days , they just 
had a few ________, t hey
 l e t hi m go.  So he  
wa s ta king a ny kind of j ob, th
ree , four j obs .  But he  would 
never, we never took anythi ng fro m 
anyone.  And we struggl ed and th
en on Febr uar y  21, 1964 our younge
st son, Mic hael , was born . 
And I knew that I ma de the right de
cision, to st ay wit h the kids at ho me.  Because, fi rst of all, i t  
would cost a fort une , four
 chil dre n you ha ve t o  ca mp, and I 
didn't wa nt to se nd t h e m t o ca mp 
because I remember ed t he 
beautiful summers that 
I ha d in the  countr y, pi
c king mushr ooms a nd my  
mo ther showing, making crowns an
d put on your hea d, a nd si ngi ng, 
and I don™t want t he m to mis s  
all this here.  I felt that 
t o give  the m l o ve, be cause  I  start ed to re
alize that it's the lo
ve t hat  I received 
that I can give to othe
rs now.  And that
 you can survive with very 
little because in Auschwitz I 
didn't ha ve a nyt hing.  And aft er I was  marrie d.  
Anyhow, wh en my youngest son wa s suppose to 
bec o me ba r mitz va h, we deci ded i nste a d for ma ki ng 
a big part y, his na me was Mic hael , ma y be r est 
in peace, that we'r e goi ng 
to go t o Israel instead.
  And t o cele b rate his  ba
r mitz va h t her e.  And s i nc e  
I 'm an i ntuit ive pe rson, and we deci ded t his al
r e ady, I wake  up one morn
ing and I said to my 

husband, "Honey, let's go now."  An
d he said, "When wa s this born?  Wh y?"  And I said, "I don't 
know why.  I just now fe el 
we s hould go now."  And 
he a gre ed.  And it wa s a 
very good de cisi on . 
And we we nt.  And for the 
fi
rst time I met my
 cous in Ut a (ph), oka y?   I 
was  eight year s old in 1934  
when she left .  I came t here in 1974, wit h my y
ounge st son.  Ours was 
always a ver y clos e knit  
fa mily and Uta (
ph) was thrilled.  We cried in 
each others ar
ms.  Because 
she was the sole survivor 
of he r fa mil y.  She al wa ys felt  
ba d t hat s he l e ft.  She never  c oul
d co me back.  An
d I remembered  
my grandmother saying, __________
_________.  So I  was  ab
le to go back with
 my  s on,  to  me e t  
my cousi n Uta ( ph).  An
d t here i s Israel, t here is a coun
try now.  And s he ga ve  hi m for hi s  
bar mitz va h a  ___________ an
d a  ___________.  
And she  a sked hi m, just l i
ke my pare nts cal led me  
affecti onat e, I called my childr en 
a ffectionate , " Micha el, what woul d you like besi des this ."  He  
said, " Not hi ng, I ' m just happy t o se
e  you."  She s ays , "No, t el l  me ."  He s aid, " O kay."   He want s a  
little chain, Michael.  And I went to
 Israel, it didn't take long.  I rece
ive a call.  My cousin Uta (ph) 
we nt to the  doctor , her c h eck up, 
a nd either on the  wa y t here or on 
t he way home , got a  heart attac k  
and di ed.  I f I wouldn't  ha ve gone 
then, I already told you 
what I, my intuition an
d that I listen to my  
intuiti on.  And I woul d not have 
seen her.  An yhow, Michael wa s 
a  beauti ful young 
man.   He  was  
very s ucc ess f ul beca us e he was love d and he had a

 and the conversations, I wr ote it

fr om it .  And I re me mber tha t  
whe n  we  move d into our  firs t ho
me , t his  is my se cond home  in  
Ameri ca.  He wa lke d over to a neighbor 's, his mo ther
, an el de rly lady.  He  sa
id, "Lady, I don't have  
any gra ndpar ents.  Would you be my
 grandmother?"  I 'm telling you t hos
e thi ngs, that 
it e f fected not  
only us, it effe cted the children.  
And she bec a me l i ke his adopt ed gr
andmot her.  She wa s ve ry good  
to him.  She lived to 
be  96.  Anyhow, Mic hael  
and I, and I reme
mb er one time , you know he was 
more than fi fteen years bet ween 
hi m and my older son.  So he al
most gr ew up like a n onl y child  
because t hey were alr eady in coll
ege , ___________.  And 
one ti me I wa s si tting 
and I fe lt so lonely  
and I said, "Michael, I need a little 
medicine."  And I'll never forget 
his scared look.  And he said, 
"Ma, are you sick?"  And I sai d, " Oh, not that ki nd
 of me dici ne.  I nee d a 
hug and a ki ss."  And he  
ca me over a nd ga ve me  a hug and 
a kiss  and a fte r that  he would 
co me  o v e r ma ny  ti
mes, he  would  
say, "Want a little medicine?"  
And that became our _________ be
tween us, medicine meant a hug 
and a kis s.  And when he
 wa s alre ady in c olle ge, he would al
wa ys , whe n I woul d writ e to hi m or  
call him, I'd say, "Michael, 
I can't wait to have 
a little medicine."  
And he said, "I ca
n™t wait to give  
it to you."  And he was very su
c ces s f ul be cause he was l ove d by 
many peopl e.  He was successful  
in coll ege.  He gr aduat ed from t he Uni ver sity 
of Rochester.  At age 
25 he was already in a 
wonder ful positi on and he owned his own ho me and 
he was successful in every way.  He was dating 
a bea uti ful girl.  And it wa s, my son Jerry was s
uppos e to gr aduate in 19
90, fr om Universit y of 
Cor nell .  And Mic ha el was here Thur sda y a nd he  
said, "M om,  Dad.  Be  re ady.  I ' m goi ng t o c o me  
and pic k you up.  We 're  goi ng t o go
 to my br other 's gra duati on."  
That was Thursday.  Friday, the 
police came and told me th
at I have no longer a son.  My son,
 Michael, was killed. 
 And instead of a  
graduati on party I  ha d a fune
ral.  He was killed 
instantly in an automobile. . 
.  [end of side 1 of tape

 and hundreds of people came to 
his funeral .  Hundreds of trees 
wer e pla nte d.  He has a gar den i n  East side fr om
 all the t rees that was 
pla nted.  My cousi n, 
_____________, my son is 
gone , my fa mi ly is gone.  And I alwa
ys we ar this, this is my most  
preci ous pi e ce of je welr y.  Mic hael . 
 And i n my l i fe ti me, I se e  the de
struction of European jewelry. 
The  ________ a nd de fea t  of Nazi  Ge

ti me , Mic ha el and I wer e very, ver y  close be cause
 he was the youngest.  And he wa s the longest  
home .  And he was  ve ry, ver y a f fe ct

 I ga ve hi m.  And whe n I l os t  
him I was thinking
, at least I was alwa ys for 
him.  An d his cards, in ou
r home we have a tradition, 
we wri t e home- made car ds.  And in
 e ach c ard he s aid, Mom you we
re al ways t here for me and you 
loved me unconditionall

went now to where they 
are living, I mean to the 
Wo rld Holocaust Survivors, 
Michael is no longer with 
me.  He is still with me
 
because he died late. 
He didn't go wit h me to t he ga ther
ing.  An d now when I we nt to th
e March of the Living, and I saw 
the trees and I was thinking.  Wh
en I went the first 
time I went for Mich
ael's barmitzvah.  M y  
husband was still a healthy 
man, now he's not.  
How many changes 
in our lives and how quickly, 
fr om good fortune to ba d fort une , li fe can c ha nge . 
 And how ma ny ti me s , if we
 don't have a, if we 
don't sa y good- bye t o the one s we l o ved.  And be cau

Q: Let me  ask you a 
couple of questions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
56 
 
 
A: Okay. 
Q: Are you okay?   Do you 
wa nt t o t a ke a  bre a k?  
A: No it's okay. 

Q: You sure? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When you came over he
re, to this country, was 
it easy for you to make ne
w frie nd s?   An d to start  
agai n?   You had to begi n agai n i n Swe den. 

A: Wh en I came here, as I said before without wa
nting to r epeat mys el f, I  didn't know one si ngl e  

person in Philadelphia.  
But when I was still in Sw
eden, when I came to 
Sweden, it was the same 
thing.  And I ' m goi ng t o go ba ck s o mething, t o Swe d
en, be ca use the sa me  thing happe ned here .  It  
happens to be related. 
 Wh en I was in Sweden, and one time 
it da wned on me , th
at if something 
wo uld happen to me , you 
know?   So a l one  a nd eve r
ythi ng.  Nobody woul d mis s
 me .  I f  I would die ,  
nobody would, it wouldn't be 
a loss if people don't kno
w me .  And I decided th
at the most  i mporta nt  
thing is fa mily and fr
ie nds.  And I  ma de an e f fo
rt t o reach out. 
 I wa s no longer  of being hurt , t hat I  
lose somebody, beca
use in life  everyone that 
we love either they will di
e before us or we will die 
be for e t he m.  But not to l ove is t h
e gr eatest loss.  Not  to 
trust is the greatest lo
ss .  Whe n I ca me her e ,  
I didn't know anyone .  Whe n I ma
de my son's barmitzvah, the first 
one, I had over 100 pe opl e.  And 
when I make my _________ bar mi t zva h, I have  
over 300 peopl e.  Whe n I was goi ng to make  
Micha el 's ba r mit zva h, a n d I start to
 make the list, we needed 500 pe
ople.  I  don't sa
y everybody was  
a pers onal, c l ose fri end, but t hey
 we re people who I was involve
d.  And I said, no, I  cannot get  
involved.  I made fo
r  my fri ends alr eady now, 
I  _________ i n Is rael .  I 
find one t hing.  That  t he  
survivors of the Holocaus
t here i n Philadel phi a, we have our , 
first we wer e  called th e J e wi sh Ne w 
Ameri cans.  Then we changed t h
e na me to Holocaust Survivors. 
 We ha ve a common past a nd a  
common responsibi lity.  To
 remember our personal stories.  B
ecause for us the Holocaust is bot h a 
personal and a collective 
Je wish tra ge dy.  It
's a human tragedy. 
Q: Di d you fi nd t hat , c e r tainl y as  you were getti ng 
started here, that it was 
easier t o be cl ose t o 
people who had a l so undergone t he 
Holoc aust?   Or did you rea dily 
ma ke fri ends with ot her people 
who ha dn't been in Europe?  

A: First of all, I c oul dn't ma ke
 friends with ot he r people unt il 
I lear ned the la nguage .  And we  
for me d alre a dy 1956, we  alrea dy ha
d here t he organizati on.  So we 
s hare d a lot t oget he r .  And we  
realized that  this cannot be just a social organiza
tion.  We have to work 
for Israel.  We have to 
re me mb er th e H olo
ca ust and to shar e wit h ot her s a nd t o te ach
.  But  for  me, I  had and I  sti ll ha ve, all  
kinds of people.  If I would sh
ow you my telephone 
book, you will say how 
can you keep up? 
Bec ause I made , I di dn't discri mi nat e.  I feel one t h
ing, the only criteria that I, that is important to 
me , i s  not  h o w  mu ch  s o me
body has, who he knows,
 what he knows, but how 
much he cares.  And 
when a pe rs on is cari ng, and he is a good, dece nt  
human being, tha n I can be
 their friend and they 
can be mine. 

Q: W
as it easy for you in the ear
l y da ys here?   Be fore you we r e
 going a round and s pea king a bout 
the Holocaust?  To talk 
about  your  experienc es?  
A: It was difficult then, 
it's difficult still. 
 However, I don't do
 only the things wh
ich are easy.  I do 
ma ny t hings  which are diffi cult but
 t hey are necessar y. 
 And when I was aske d, t her e wa s her e a  
profe ss or ___________, the lat e 
____________, I menti oned to yo
u before.  And she is fro m 
____________.  An
d s h e wrote  a book of t he Holoc aust  a nd 
she, onc e a fr iend 
of ours fr om the  
orga niza tion invite d about 20 s urvi v ors.  I didn't kno
w wh at the pur po se wa s, 
it wasn't like a social 
thing.  And I found out th
at she wanted to or ga nize, that pe ople shoul d s pea k on the Hol oc aust .  

And I went there and that  was the first time that 
different survivors among ou
rsel ves start ed to shar e 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435  
57 
 
 
a little feelings.  And I reali
zed that there is not, we 
realized that there is ve
ry little in the text books 
about it. 
Q: Ac tuall y wh at I ' m tr y i ng t o un
der stand is , not  so muc h i n a for ma l  wa y, spe a ki ng about it , but  
you had fri e nds fr om all wal ks of li
fe , talki ng in t he earli er da ys her e.  Wa s this s o met hing that you 
coul d t alk about?   That y
ou could s ha re?   Did pe ople
 want to hear about it? 
A: I never went around a nd volunteer ed. 

Q: Just on a pers ona l basi s. 

A: Okay, but I me an, 
what happened was that wh
en people saw t he number
 they start to ask me 
que stions .  And I answe red.  I al wa
ys, I did the  s a me thi ng li ke I di
d with my children when they 
aske d a bout sex.  Short questi on, shor t ans wer .  Th
ey a ske d me so I a ns we red.  And pe ople , not too 

many people were so interested, they didn't know 
what it is.  And then, a little later, when people  
started to know about  it, especiall y
 the Holocaust survi vors, realized
 that in the text book there is 
very little about the Holo
caust.  They speak about 
Wo rld War One but not abou
t the Holocaust.  So 
we start ed to for m an or ganizati onand be involved with th
is here.  So it was diff
icult.  Because, to 
give  you one exa mple , wi
t h some peopl e it was eas
ier.  Some ar
e more compassi
onate, some  are 
more underst andi ng an
d more c uri ous .  Others ar
e more i nvolved wit h thei
r own life.  So it depends 
who i t  was .  I ha d my l a
te friend told me that 
s o meone a ske d her once  a bout the  Hol oca ust and s he  
started to tell a little bit.  She sa
id, "Well, we had that
 in America hard too.
  We didn't have any 
steak."   And after  that she deci de
d never t o ta lk about  the Hol oc aust  to her .  The  Hol oc aust  ha s  
taught me many lessons.  Becaus
e before the Holocaust I only ha
d positive experien
ces.  I had no 
fra me of reference with whi ch to 
compare all t h e blessi ngs
 t hat I ha ve.  The  ble ssi ng of a loving 
fa mi ly.  The blessi ng of good he
a l t h.  The ble s sing of ha vi ng my home.  Not to be called all 
di ffere nt na me s.  Bec ause I 've be en called all ki nds of
 na me s.  I've been c alled 
no name at all.  I've 
bee n call ed, derogat ory now, 
__________ J e wes s , whic h was  anti-
Se miti c na me .  I was  calle d you 
refugee.  You foreigner.  All kind
s of name .  And I feel one thing, 
that its very i mpo
rtant.  Respect 
for one anot her.  Respect 
for di fferences.  That we 
cannot expect everybody to be ali ke.  And t hat 
we must, I don't want t o use the wo
r d  mu st be caus e that s ounds  dictat orial .  It 's i mporta n t to prot ect  
our huma n ri ghts .  And j ust, in t he 
ve ry be gi nni ng, with eve n t he s ma llest i ncident t hat 's ha ppe ne d.  
Whe n s o me body does not tr e at you right .  I have lear ne d t o be
c o me a __________
___.  I wa nt t o  
give you an exa mple be c ause t hat 's going to be 
more.  I was  invite d se ve ral year s ago to an ope n  
house , a ba r bec ue.  And the ba rbe cue  started bec a
use t here was some
 pe ople who wer e  suppose to 
come fr om other cities to
o, it was like a big gathering.  They st
arted to come  on Friday until Sunday 
evening.  We came Sunday.  We li
ve, it was n 't  in Phila del phia .  
And when we arr i ved, not t he  
owner  but one of t he guests gree ti
ng me with anger.  "What's the ma
tter?  Wh y so late?"  At that 
ti me I re aliz ed, I had a c hance to s ort  out my e mo tions , a nd I r ealize d that i f I a ns wer in anger he is  

contr olli ng me  e mot iona lly.  So I l ooked at hi m very
 c al mly a nd I  sai d, "Thank
 you.  I am so gla d  
that you mis sed me ."  And he a ns we r ed, " You know 
I li ke you Yit-c
ola ( p h)
."  And I s aid, "Tha nk  
you" again.  Thi s man, may he r est
 in peace, is no longer ali ve.  
He was otherwise a good man, but 
he had a habit of pu
tting some people down .  And I have noticed that vo
lubility illicits aggression in 
the group, c o mpa ssi on i n the  ki nd, and sile nce i n th
e indifferent.  And this
 is nothing to do with 
race, color or religion.  It  has to do wi th the abili ty 
of sel f i mage, of
 confidence, of the ability to l ove 
yoursel f bec ause you cannot lo
ve othe rs if you don't love yours elf
.  And t o care.  To know t hat what  
we do e ffect s not onl y us, it e ffect
s other s too.  Bec ause a fte r the 
Hol oca ust, I was thinki ng ma ny  
ti me s, you know I told you I lik
e t o wr ite, and I wa s thi nking up
 to age 13 most
 decisions my  
pare nts and grandmot her  made  for  me.  You know c h
il dren don't make where t o li ve and what  to  
do, of c our s e I had some .  During 
the  Hol oca ust I coul dn't ma ke choi
ces a b out my li fe.  Eve n a fter

the Holocaust.  Ok ay, I 
could have said no, I don't wa nt to co
me here.  But I didn't have many 
choi ces .  I  c oul d sa y, I c o me, I don't come , but I  c
oul dn't say I want t o go
 some pla ce else bec aus e  
the _________ ___________.  So I fe
lt that so much in my life I ha
d to li ve and to do by choice s  
whi ch ot hers  made t hat e f fe cte d me .  And I sat  
down once and I  wrote  just
 a fe w words.  And it 
goes like this: 
Fo ur groups of people 

Dramatically infl uence my destiny. 

My late, beloved family in
 Ch eck-hon-off (ph), Poland 
Who knew me  and loved me  and em
powered me with positive energy.

But  hate d me mere ly for  being bor

The bystanders, wh o knew but didn't care. 

And t he  Swe dish Re d Cr oss , who di

From Nazi tyranny and

I am one and the same  person. 

If four di ffe r ent groups of pe opl e vie w ed me  di ffer ently, 

And t r eate d me  di ffere ntl y, 

I was loved for who I am 

And I wa s hated and star ved 
and tortured 
for who I am. 
The more t h e Nazi s t ort
ured me for who I am 
The more I wa s determined ne
ver  to bec o me li ke  the m, 
But  t o vie w mysel f  thr ough their  e yes . 

To the Nazis, I was just a 
number, s ub-huma n, a  ve r mi n. 

But I am not a number. 

My numb er is my  badge of honor. 
Let those  res ponsibl e for the number  f
eel asha med, or  what ever  they want. 
I a m a proud Je wis h da ughter. 
To be  bor n J ewi sh is neit her a c r i me nor a  di sgr ace , 

But  t o st arve , t ortur e a nd murde r  i nnocent  pe opl e  

For  being born J e wis h is  a cr

and huma nity. 
A cri me that has infl ue

Because whatever  we 
choose  to sa y and do 
We  ar e bec o mi ng par t ner s too. 

But  other s a r e becomi ng t he be

Or  the  vi cti ms  of our  evil de eds .

Therefore, I fe el that 
my first responsibility 

Is to God 

To live by the 
commandments

And not  t o tr ans gres s t he m  
Bec ause I  ca nnot do evil  wit hout bec o mi ng evi l . 

The lessons that my father taught
 me, whatever I do I 
become, if I lie I'm goi
ng to beco me a liar and 
I 'll hel p hi m and ot her s. 

And I know one  thi ng, 
we live in this world 
We ar e r esponsi ble 
for  one another .  
But not in a way to 
punis h e ach ot her .  
So whenever  ther e i s 
i njustice and cruelty 
We  nee d t o be, to s pea k 
out , no matte r wher e it  is . 
And t o sta nd in sol idari ty 
wi th those  who are  repr esse d 
And not  wit h t he oppre ss or. 

In t he final  a nalysis , wit h out  ______________
, all _________, religi onand education fai ls. 
So  we need first to impr
ove our sel ves because then 
we ma ke  a  better  worl d. 
 

If you wis h I  ca n s hare  wi th you a  fe w 
of the poems if there is still time . 

Q: I have a question.  Be
cause you do fe el responsi ble, a sense of responsibi
lity for your world . . . 
A: Our world. 

Q: Right, but it's the same.  Are there certain events
, hist oric al eve nts, i n the last forty years or s o  
that had a really str ong i mpact 
on you other than, you've mentione d th
e bi rth of t he Isr aeli St ate.  
Are  the r e ot her t hings  that ha ve  
e f fe cted you i n this countr y, lik
e the Civil Rights
 Movement or 
war s or a nyt hing?  

A: Yes .  I feel, do you re me mb
er there was a ______
____ who ca me a nd he 
wa nte d to, here in  
Philadelphia, to speak in 
t he movie s a bout the Naz is?   We  went
 and marc he d.  Whe n the r e was , we  
went t o speak.  Then t her e was sup
pose to be a rally here, Nazis want
ed to march here.  We  we nt to 
court , I wa s a mong the m, and we f
ought a gai nst it .  Whe n I he ar in
 pr ivat e life, it doe sn't onl y ha ve 
to be in big things, in 
pr i vate  li fe , when I  was , 
when I hear  that somebody 
is ma ki ng a  joke or on 
some body el se 's  e xpe ns e, 
or an et hnic  gr oup, ge ne ra
lizati ons , I  sta nd up a n d I speak up.  I  s aid, "I  
don't  apprec iate what you s aid." 
 In fa ct, one of my  dear frie
nds  who is  non-Je wi sh, who I  met  
through s uc h oc casi on.  Bec ause we wer e in 
the _____________, it was 
a meeti ng and so mebod y  
said some thi ng ne gati ve about a not
he r gr oup.  And I sai d, 
"I really don't apprec
iate  be caus e I kn o w  
how it  feel s when pe opl e  do
 that."  So in small th
ing.  You know, prej udic e
 is ver y easy because  
you don't ha ve to give ac counts fo
r it .  You jus t  sa y it but you don't ha ve to give, you know?   And  

the point is one thing, it's
 like fire.  When t here i s onl y one spar
k, you ca n e r ase it .  But i f t here i s a  
big fi re, you have no cont
rol any longer.  So in th
e little thing and the inter-rel
ationship, in our daily 
life, in the personal, how we do
 people.  Beca use  us uall y whe n 
a per son from one  gr oup offe nds 
anot her , someti mes he starts hating or bei ng a n gr
y towards the whole gr oup. 
 So its important to 
respe ct e ach other.  It 's i mport ant t o  spe ak up
 when ther e is a cause,
 when the  Rus sian pe opl e  
wo rked, you know, wh
en there wa s Iron Curtain, and we were
 fighting to re
lease them, I wa s 
mar chi ng.  So when there is somet h ing, a speci al
 cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I 
write a letter, I speak up. 
 That 's my c ontri buti on.  Those are th
e things whi ch I do.  I ca nnot sa y, it  
doe sn't bot her beca use it  effe cts .  You know, I just
 wa nte
d to add, t he Holoca ust e f fe c t ed not just  
me, because the point is one thin
g, six million Jewish 
people and about

a cri minal .  Wh at trade-off is that?  So it 's 
i m porta nt.  Even to, in 
my own home, to my own 
hus ba nd, I once tol d my hus ba nd, in sicknes s and in povert y a nd in riches and poor a n d ever ythi ng, 
I will always stand by you ______
______.  But you commit a crime a
nd I don't want to
 be any part 
of it.  The n you ha ve to trade your
sel f i n.  So t he r e are cert ai n loya
ltie s.  In li fe we ne ed to ma ke 
choi ces.  We need t o say t o bri ng up decent  chi ldren
 we have t o  learn to sa
y no.  Because
 you know, 
in the commandme nts t h ere is the ten comma ndments .  It says you s hall , you shall not.  And anothe r  

thing how you can put out, you canno
t hatred with hatred, anger with
 anger.  Somebody once said in 
anger to me , I hate you. 
 Because I wo uldn't give in
 to some thing that was no
t moral  or ethic al.  I 
said, it's okay I love you for both
 of us.  An d the person
 apol ogized, she sai d, I 
really don't hate yo u 
it 's j ust t hat  I  wa s a ngr y wit h you, I c oul dn't, yo
u are st ubbor n.  I sai d, wh
a t you c all st ubborn, that  
stubbor n is what save
d me from.  Because, 
i n fact, I al ways felt what my
 fami ly taught me .  That no 
power i n the world can 
break my spirit as long as I don't 
colla bor ate wit h pe opl e  in my own 
destruction.  Because what we do
, this is what we be
come.  You kill you be
come a killer.  You 
cheat  you become a cheat.  You sa
ve some body s o you, 
so the final analysis, 
it's not how much we  
know or  how muc h we  have, 
how much we car e.  Caring i s  what  
life  is all about.  And we have a 
wonder ful group in Phi l adel phia 
no w, t hat was  in the mu seu m 
last week.  They are called  
Cha mpi ons of Ca ring.  High Sch
ool  stude nts .  And thi s is spons ore d by t he Holocaus t Muse um i n  
the Was hington.  And by the Jewi
sh Relations Counsel in
 Phil adel phia .  And the ________, al so in 
Phil adel phia.  And t hose kids , what
 do the y do?   The y go a nd help
 those who ar e less fortunate .  
The  sic k, t he  elderl y, the  disa bled. 
 This is what we ne
e d to do.  You know, 
the str onge st  me ssa ge I  
can give , what I 've lea r ne d, i f we
 are not our brot her 's kee per , by omissi on we bec o me our brot her ' s  
killers.  Because there are sins by 
omission and sins by commission. 
Q: Would you li ke t o rea d  some thi ng?  

A: Yes.  I pi cked those t wo poems because, act ually t here are three 
poems that I woul d like t o share 
wit h you i f t here  is  enough ti me. 

Q: We 'll see. 
A: Okay.  The fi rst one i s cal
led 'A Wo rld That Va nished'.  
Q: And wh en did 
you write these?  
A: Thi s  was  writt en Ma y 8 , 1 97 8.  A l on g ti me  
ago be caus e the Holoc aust , I 've be en li ving a n d 
breat hing it , it 's e f fe ct

The Nazi boots are marching 
My world with terror is filled 

The  Hol y Sc riptur

Children are starved,

The ghett os are cl osi ng us in 

What  is ther e for  us i n st ore? 

My world is  goi ng slower  and slower  

Nothing is like

The  frei ght t r ains  are  ta ki ng us  on a j o urne y 

For  most it  i s 
the last ride 
My brot her s and sisters ar e burni ng 

The re i s no more pla ce t o hide  

Hitler's fi nal solu

We ar e tr apped i n 
a world of Hell 
I am amazed that  
I ha ve  s urvi ved 
The horr ors from the Holoca ust to tell 

 

And t her e i s anot her  poe m, which 
is called "I Am Not A Number",
 a nd I wrote i t M ay 13, 1994. 
I was trapped in the killi

Surr ounded by bar be d wi res, 
gas chambers, smoke and flame 
The  Nazi s t a ttooe d a number on my ar m 

2-5- 6-7- 3 be ca me my ne w na me  

They tried to redu

De huma niz e  me da y by day 

But  re gar dle ss of

The  c oul d not ta ke  my s elf wor t h a w ay 
They murdered in the ga s chambers my entire fa mi ly 
In one  si ngl e  da y 

All  my eart h ly pos ses sions we

They t reated me wor se th

Even though I did no

The y hat ed me  mer ely for being bor n J e wish 

And star ved and tort ur

I was only 13 years old wh en they to

But  t hey c ould not  take a wa y my

For  nearl y si x night marish years

Nevertheless, I have
 outlived Hitler an

And l i ve d my st ory t o tel l  

 

The third one is my conv

son, Mi chael.  When he 
asked me t he fir st ti me

And this was writt

Who wrote on your ar m,  Mom?

The  Nazi s t a ttooe d t his  number  on my ar m 
I told my  son short and plain 

Why di d t he y do it, Mo m?  He as ked furthe r  

My God, I  thought ,

You see  my child,

He  was  ve ry cruel  and hat eful

I want ed to protect  hi m

From knowing my  de

So I answered his ques

He  want ed t o know why we  Je ws ar e hate d 

Did we  commit some kind of a crime?  

No, my chil d, I  tol d my s on, 

We  have not  commi tted a ny cri me  

Yet  we Je ws  ha ve  be en vi

Do  you hate the Nazis fo

Now I ha ve no gra ndpare nts and r elati ves  like  my friends  

The Nazi  mu rdered 
all our loved ones 
The y ha ve bl ood on their  hands  

I know, my  child, that
 you too are hurting 
But  hatre d a nd revenge c an ne ver r est ore  
The lives of those who pe

And t he  pr ec ious  things
 we  ha d once be for e  
You and I  who know

Must  ne ver  i n flict  hurt a n d pain 
We  mu st try to bui

So the deat h of t he victi m

This is my message. 

Q: Di d you t alk muc h
 a b out  your  experienc es  wit h your s ons?  
A: Yes .  B ut I spo ke to 
them, I told them, but I s
poke to them more about my
 experiences before t h e 
Holocaust.  I want ed them to know their grandparen
ts.  Because I felt its important.  And as a result, 
my oldest son __________, a coup
le of years, two or three year
s ago and maybe a little longer , 
came here to visit.  He lives in
 Ne w York.  And a ft erwards he c alls
 me up a nd he s a id, " Ma, I ha d a  
very trau mat i c experie nc e."  I sai d, " What 's happene
d? "  He  s a id, "I was  wa
iti ng for t he trai n a nd I  
sa w a ma n l aying fac e down ac ros s t he trac ks .  A
nd I s a w from near by t h at 
the tr ain i s comi ng.  I  
didn't know whether he was drunk, 
dead, sick, pushed, or 
wanted to co mmit suicide.  I had no idea. 
And I  was  t hinking, 
what s hould I do?   M y mi nd was r aci ng.
  On t he  one hand, I  risk my li fe 
beca use I didn't know i f I 'm goi ng t o
 be able , ge t ti me t o get ba ck.  And on t he ot her hand, I t hought,  
what would my gr andmother do?  
 My grandmother _______________
_."  Because I  t old hi m t he 
story how my mother sac r ifi ced he
rs el f a nd me .  And he said, " I  ju
mpe d up and I sa ve d hi m.  People

had t o pull me up."  My first r
eacti o n was, how coul d y
ou do somethi ng like thi s
?  And then I sai d, 
"_____________, whe n you gra duate d from Yal e Uni ver s
ity I fel t  you ac hi eve d some thing s peci al.  
But this is something more special
.  You pr ove d t h at you are  a  _____
______ and that is the highest 
religion, education and achievement.  I am very 
grat e ful ."   Another t hi
ng, beca use  everyt hin g  
effects , a not her t hing is  that wh
en he was little and he
 wa s t he olde st a n d he
 was not bor n i n thi s  
country, ha d also to lear n the langua ge and go t h rough the di ffi cult y as a child.  I onc e told hi m,  
beca use he aske d me al so a bout 
my  experience.  I said, "_____
_______, bot h y
our pare nts ar e  
survivors of the Holocaust.
  We  lost ever ythi ng t hat was  ours .  
All t hat we ha ve is  our  good na me . 
And if you will, I w
ill always love y
ou unconditionally,
 no matter what you 
will do because you are 
my chil d.  But just li ke I ought to 
fe e d you, I ought to fee d you spirit
uall y.  But there i s one t hing.  
You do s o mething moral l y a nd et hi
ca lly wr ong, you wi ll not
 be allowed to have
 my na me ."  And I  
completely dismissed it fr om my mi
nd.  Wh en he was an adult  alread
y and I ca me to vis it.  And al l  
of a  sudden, he start s tel ling 
me, "You know, Mom?   Wh enever 
I was going to 
do something I 
aske d mys el f , is this goi ng to di sgr ac e my pare nts ?
"  And thank God, my s on gre w up t o be a ver y 
respectable, loving son, 
husband, father.  He has now a little gi
rl, my grandchild, our grandchild.  
She is na me d after my
 la te son, sec ond na me .  He r na me is
 Eli zabet h Michaela.  We cal l her Eliza-
la (ph).  And s he was he re s hortl
y be fore I  we nt on t he  Mar c h of 
the Livi ng, Apri l 14, 1996.  And 
for the first t i me, she not iced my
 number.  And she looks at me , 
she says, she was he re Mother 's 
Da y.  During the ti me she learned a li ttle more , sh
e gre w .  And she's playi n g, busy pl ayi ng, and she 

takes  a l ook on my a r m a nd she  sa
ys , "Bar bie , A- B- C's."   Bec a use  
she has a book with A- B- C's and 
she se nse d t hat this is rel ated.  She 's onl y two yea r s 
old.  So it 's even effect
ing he r.  For  me, for my 
children, even for my grandch
ildren, it's too late.  They w
ill never know the joy of having 
grandparents  and Aunts a nd 
Uncle, t h ey di dn't know.  But hope fu
lly it s not goi ng to be t oo lat e for  
other s.  And I want t o fi ni sh wit h
 a very inspiring story.  Reme mber
 that I repeated many times that  
my grandmo t her 's pr over b, you only have what you 
gi ve away.  In 1984, I 
received a letter from a 
pers on t hat I  didn't e ve n know.  Ida J ervis (
ph) , _____________, Was hi
ngton.  And I ope ne d the  
letter and I start readi
ng it and it  says, I ' m your c ousi n. 
 I 'm na me d a fter  the  sa me great-
grandmot her , ____________ 
_____________.  I was four years  old 
when my fa mi ly le ft Pol and and 
I'm sure that you will appreciat
e this.  And I'm looking, she 
send me a phot
ograph of my 
grandmot her  and her s o n.  And I thanke d her.  Sh
e invit e d me to c o me a nd vi sit .  Reall y not 
knowi ng what to expect , a 
sur vivor, how I ' m going to act?  Am 
I going to be react ing nor mal , am I  
being all broken up, or  whate ver. 
 And I ca me  a nd ther e wa s a not he
r relative who kn
e w my  mo th e r  
beca use t he y  were cousi n s and she l e ft short l y be fo
re the war.  And s h
e 's te lling me t hat  ever y yea r  
for many years now, t hey have
 a ____________ fa
mil y  reuni on, because
 t his cousin was 
____________ a nd she c a me w
ith he r sister a nd t hey starte d t his beca use people li ved in di fferent  
places.  And they invite
d  me to  co me  wit h  my  fa mil y.  We 
went.  From not havi ng any rela tive s  

here , all of sudden I ha d more th
an 130, 140 rel at i ves.  And until th
i s day, whene ver
 we can we go 
for Tha nks giving reunion.  We a r e close .  And 
my cousi ns spea k with price , my c ousi n, ever y 
occa sion, my c ousins .  They ha ve  fa mil y.  So, be
cause my gr andmother send thi s pict ure away from 
Eur ope, this  pictur e i s now r etur ne d t o me  a nd I r
ealized now I can tell you 
what you can give away, 
you still ha ve it.  After I  lost ever ything in t he 
Holoc aust .  My home, my
 fami ly, my community, 
my ea rthl y posse ssi ons , s i x years  of 
my life  and went thro
ugh a  living Hell .  I fo
und out, when I had 
lost ever ythi ng ma terial , that I  ha ve
 spiritual things to 
gi ve.  The Na zis hat ed me  but t h ey c oul dn't 
stop me fr om l ovi ng pe ople , fr om 
believi ng i n God, and fr om c aring
 a n d wanti ng to help.  And we  
certai nly have what we gi ve a wa y.  We can give up, 
for over 20 ye ars I 've bee n gi ving awa y st orie s, 
about the Holocaust, about my fa
mily.  Many people tell me, I  kno
w you because y
our grandmot her

and parents, like they would be 
mine.  And I still can give away. 
 We  can give k
nowledge, a poem,  
love , c o mpa ssion.  What  
you are doi ng, to give awa y 
type d, to rec ord t h is here , it 's t he s piritua l  
things t hat  nobody ca n t ake a w
ay.  And t he res ult, pa ssing the m
 ont o t he next  generations .  Th e  
result  is pas sing the m onto any pe rs on, ol der , y
oung, stra nger or fa mily. 
 Whe n we  do t hat , then  
long after we are gone  they rema
in.  Bec ause Anne Fra nk wr ote a  di
ary.  She  is  gone  and her  di ar y 
is going to live on.  An
d we can al wa ys give a way kind wor ds 
and good de eds .  No mat t er how poor  
or rich we are.  How educated or
 not.  And this is wh
at is important.  This
 is the lesson of the 
Holocaust.  Now you 
underst and why I  felt  it 's 
important to talk about my
 fa mi ly.  They gave  me  
unconditional love.  Showed
 me, my  mother's 
experience and I, many ti
mes when I think, if she 
coul d l ove me  s o, so much a stra
nger, how muc h more did s he l ove
 me?  And that gives me, ma kes 
me  feel like I'm worthwhile. 
 And t his  is ver y i mportant.
