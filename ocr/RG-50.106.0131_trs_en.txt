A: My father™s name was 
Abba Lin
 and my mother™s name 
Kia Lin
, born 
Hayman. 
Q: And what kind of work
 did your father do? 
A: My father, he was born 
in the small village called
 Babovka
, and in the 
beginning he -- he studied in 
Yeshiva. 
But th en he decided to drop it and became a 
tailor and when he came to 
Riga 
he established a small business. Yeah, a small 
busin ess. 
Q: Did you -- do you have any sib
lings, any brothers or sisters? 
A: I have a half si -- a half sister. Sh
e was born in -- after the war, in 1946.  
Q: Did you have a large extended family in 
Riga
, aunts, uncles, cousins, 

grandparents? 
A: Yes, I -- I had a -- a large extended family in 
Latv ia
 actually, because my 
grandfather had 15 brothe

i-in those times, half of them 
died early. But -- 
Q: This is your grandfather on your father™s side?

A: My father came over from 
Barovka
, they rented an apartment in 
Sardonikova 
Street. 
Sardonikova
 Street was in the -- the so-called 
Moscow
 
[indecipherable]
. 
And no -- how is it to say maybe less than
 a mile from the center of the city, 
because 
Riga
 was then a small town, only 300,0
00 people. And yeah, this was mo st 
-- a lot of Jews li -- used to live there and 
later it became a ghetto over there, so you 
should know th
e area, about. It was -- 
Q: How would you describe 
the neighborhood, was it a mi
ddle class neighborhood?  
A: I would mo stly describe it as a work
ing class neighborhood. Across the stre et 

they had -- it was not a church. In  Russian language it was called 
bougadena
, 
where they  used to house 
poor people, you know. And 
I would say work ing class 
like shop owners or factory wo rkers or sm
all business people. Like my  father was, 

yeah. 

Q: How did your parents me et each other? 

A: Well, my parents met each other -- you -- 
the villages where they used to live are 
very close to each other, about six kilo
meters, I think, or maybe less from each 
other. So one village was called 
Skundaliena
 and th e other was called
 Barovka
. 
And they  probably knew each other mu ch ea
rlier than -- before
 they got married. 
Q: And did your mo ther work? 

A: I -- I want to ask -- no, just ask me a perso n  
[tape break]
 Okay. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

Q: And so can you tell us a little bit about
 your mother™s family and background. 
A: Okay . My mother 
was born actually in 
Daugavpils
 in a hospital, but it was si -- 
six kilometers from th e village called 
Skundaliena
 as I mentioned. And my  
grandmother, he -- her name was -- maiden name, 
Kuperschmidt,
 right? And my  
grandfather™s name is 
Hayman
. So where they got married
, they had a small farm, 
let™s say maybe 18 acres, s -- a -- a coun
try store and a few cars, ma ybe seven cars 
and th-th-they possess some land. It -- it™s
 unusual, I think fo r the Jews to possess 
land, right, in 
Latv ia
. So they considered
 themselves more or
 less well -- well off, 
right? And so my  mo ther actually, since he
r childhood, she worked
 in the farm and 
worked in the store and work
ed in the office, 
keep the book -- bo
okkeeping with her 
sister and older brother. He
r older brother went to 
Daugavpils
 and then became a -- 
a -- a businessman. And she and her older si
ster and their mothe
r, they -- they ran 
the st -- the business. And my -- on my fath
er™s side, my father was a blacksmith 
and so they were poorer, much poorer. An
d my -- you see, my mother was a foo -- 
of the so called -- may b e they
 considered themse
lf intelligentsia 
or something. So 
she married  late, because she 
was very choosy, I think. So
 -- but she realized that 
my  father was a good man and had a -- a head
 on his shoulders, so I guess it™ s how -
- what happened. 

Q: How religious were your parents? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
5
A: This is a peculiar situation because my
 mother was never a religious woman, and 
my father was very religious. I remember 
that on holiday s my  grandfather used  to 
send a -- a 
kishen.
 We™re talking in Yiddish, but it™
s a pillow in Eng
lish, with a -- 
with a chicken, you know, 
ga -- slaughtered ch icken. 
I do -- even remember th e 
blood in  the 
kishen
 and the -- a-and th e feathers, you know. And my  -- my  father 
tried to have a Jewish house, kosher, all of
 this, but my mother always resisted and 
sometimes my father was take -- would ta
ke a -- a knife my mother used to cut 
butter and then use it for meat, an d thro
w it out the window. And this what the 
situation was. You know, so th ere 
was a -- you know, I would say, a 
contrarian
 
interest. Of how you call it? 
Q: A little disagreement, contention? 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. 
[in d ecipherable]
 that again? 
Q: What language did your parent
s speak to each other and to  you? 
A: To each other they spoke Yiddish, but to
 me they always sp
oke Russian, and we 
lived in a -- in 
Latv ia
. Is -- but -- but in -- in 
those areas, they came from 
Latgalia 
where people mo stly spoke Ru ssian langua
ge more than Latvian, because it was 
close to Polish border too. So th ey spok
e Po lish , my  mo th er 
spoke German and my 
father, of course, spoke Hebrew and Latv
ian and that. And my father served in 
Latvian army  too, when he was a young man.

Q: Did your parents feel that they were La
tvian first, or Jewish first? What do you 
think? 
A: No, it™s hard for me to tell because 
I was very young, but I can imagine that 
when you live in a bu -- ho
w it is, I -- of course they
™re Jews. F-Fir -- first and 
foremo st they™re Jewish people, but you
™re loyal to your country where you live. 
It™s -- it™s why he served in the army
, and dealt with the -- in business and 
everything, it™s -- it -- and 
he stayed, even -- he™s -- hi
s brother actually left for 
Palestine 
in 1934 to become a 
chalut, 
but we stayed in -- now
 I want to turn off 
and I want to say something, but I don™
t know what to say.
 Turn off, please. 
[tape 
break]
 What -- where did we stop? 
Q: Well, you were talking 
ab out this organization. 
A: Yes, you see, in 
Latvia
 there was an organization called 
[indecipherable]
 and 
this organization actually an-a
nybody could belong to -- to
 this organization, but -- 
and my  mother and my  aunt, and probably
 my  grandmother, I™m not sure, belonged 
to this organization, 
[indecipherable]
 just was a pure Latvian organization. I would 

call it guards, and because you were a 
property per-person, 
you should have 
belonged to this, especially in rural 
areas, that™s what I want to say. 
Q: An-A nd did they  belong? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
7
A: Yeah, they did belong to  this organiza
tion. Of course, during the Soviet times it 
was forbidden and we™d not -- you wouldn
™t mention that you belonged to this 
organization, but if a -- as a matter of 
survival you would like 
to belong to this 
organization, my  mo ther did. 

Q: Did it require her to do anything? 

A: No, it didn™t require, probably  only paid
 dues, and you know, probably only that. 
Q: What are your very first memories? 
A: I would say my fir -- very first memori
es, th-the coming of Soviet army  in 1940. 
Maybe before I have some memo ries, but
 in 1940 I -- I re
memb er standing by 
school numb er 56 
[indecipherable]
 Soviet times it was number 56, and I saw 
Soviet tanks coming off
 Moscowyella
, it™s a street called
 Moscowyella
 in 
La tv ia
. 
And I remember the small tanks, yeah. And 
where they parked, th
ey were parked -- 
there was a -- a street called 
Zilnaw iela
 where the great synagogue used to stand, 
that they burned it. There was a cor -- small corner between 
Lacspiesa iela 
and 
Zi lnaw iela 
and all the -- right there there was 
a corner where the Soviet tanks 
stood. And this I rememb er vividly. 
Q: Did you -- of course, you were born in
 1936, so you were 
so very young, but 
before that time of the Soviet tanks, do 
you have any reco llection of your parents

talking about difficult times
, hard times, a ma n named 
Hitler
? Anything that brings 
back that memory? 
A: I can tell you something about 
[indecipherable]
 I™ll tell you, my father was a 
small businessman and about maybe seven, 
10 people used to wo
rk for him in the 
shop, tailor shop, and he made
 the suits for -- for a comp any. So  after the Soviets 
came, of course he had to relinquish his bu
siness and what is interesting, that the 
Soviet government, they hire
d him to work for them in 
the army, to make uniforms, 
I think, and th -- and he was making 
good money, they  paid very  well. 

Q: He was working as a civilian in the army? 

A: Yes, as a civilian, he was working in th
e Soviet army as a civilian, yes. And the -
- the former, his employees -- you know, in
 -- in capitalist countries the employee 
not -- not always is satisfied with his sala
ry or something. So they  would -- befo re 
the Soviets came in, th ey knew they would 
come in, they said 
oh , w h en  th ey  co me 
in, you -- you will not feel so good. After th
ey came in, my fath
er was hired by the 
Soviets and the workers made 
so little that th ey would meet my fath er and say, I -- 
how good it was when we work ed for you, 
in comparison what 
we make now when 
we work for the Soviets.  
Q: Let™s get back to your me
mory of when you were fo
ur years old, and you saw 
these -- the tanks coming in.

A: Yes. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah, what -- can you describe 
-- what -- what your thoughts were? 
A: I-I -- I couldn™t have any thoughts for de
sse -- was too young to, I was not even -
- 1940 I was under four years old, still.
 But I remember it very well, and -- 
Q: Do you reme mb er being frightened? 
A: No, I was never frightened, I couldn™t 
understand that actually, frighten ed or not, 
th-this is a -- not the -- the sense that I had. 
Q: What kind of school were yo
u going to  at four years old? 
A: At four years old I didn™t go to no school. 
Q: Oh, you were just 
standing on the corner. 
A: Oh yeah, I standing with 
my mother. I was standing 
on the corn er and watching 
this passing by, that™s it. It™s a -- it™s 
a natural thing because
 you know, something 
new.  

Q: Did she say anything to you, that you rememb er? 
A: No, I can™t rememb er that 
she -- she -- she told me, no. 
Q: And then  wh en is your next memo ry? 
A: My next memory is when
 the war started. In 1941, 
it was June. And I think -- I 
remember my father carrying me -- before
 that I would say wh en we left our

apartment, we -- we possess some goods, es
pecially with -- my father had some 
stuffs. I remember sacks of
 goods sitt ing on the floo
r, we lefted everything. 
Q: Now wha -- wha -- you™re talking abou
t leaving your apartment, why were you 
le -- why were you leav ing? 
A: Why we were leaving? We
 had to run. We had to run for our lives and I think 
my  father took me on his arms. He only 
put on -- he had the leather, I rememb er, a 
black leather overcoat and my  mother took
 a few things. She -- my father had the 
golden watch, and th is overcoa
t and then he carried me to
 -- to the railroad. Not to 
the station, on th e
 Lacspiesa iela
 there was an overpass. And 
that™s to the train. And 
I think this was the last train. And I reme
mber -- I™ll tell y ou the truth, I remember 
shooting, and I think sh ooting and shooting 
and shooting a lot. And I wouldn™t say I 
can say for sure that they we
re bombing us at this particul
ar time, but I am sure that 
the train was the last o n e to leave 
Riga
. I can™t say the date, but this was the last 
train. And I was -- sat in the train, it was 
a mixed train of civ
ilians and military. And 
we took off so slowly
, it was so slow -- there was a place called 
Mezure
 
Park
, it™s -
- 
Mezu re
 
Park
 it™s -- it™s like a forest park. It
™s pine trees, you know? And it took 
us so many hours to get to 
Mezu re Park,
 it was maybe five kilometers from u s. 
And you know what happened? Turned out
 the military suspected that the m-
machinist there, loco
motive machinist, that™s called? 
He was probably a traitor is 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

what we understood. So, I-I -- I saw it. Th
ey pulled him out of 
the locomotive, put 
him against the train and shot him dead.And since -- after that, the train began 
moving, and quickly -- pretty fast. And th
en suddenly, German 
airplanes came over 
us and began bomb ing. They  began bomb ing,
 we left the train, began running into 
the forest. And I personally, I remember I fell 
into a pit, a very deep pit with water. 
I lost my parents, I didn't know where they
 are. And I woke up -- I-I woke up on the 
-- on the table, operating table, right in th e forest. And th e doctors, they patch me 
up. I -- I was wounded in my right leg. Ev
en now I have a big scar. And yes, it™s 
how it happened. We boarded our train back
 and it turned out that the last three 
cars, railroad cars, they were blown apart,
 an d my  mama to  -- mama to ld  me th at 
about 40 people died in the train. So, I th
ink it was the last train, and from then we 
moved pretty good to-towards 
Estonia
 and we moved pretty fa
st I would say til we 
reached 
[indecipherable]
, then we came to 
Yeloslavil. Yeloslav Skyoblis,
 it™s a 
region, 
Yeloslav Sky -- 
yeah. 
Q: Let™s move back a little 
bit. In between 1940 and 19
41, betwine -- b-between the 
time that the tanks came in and the time you 
had to leave in that year, do you have 
any memories of that time, of -- 

A: Between 19 -- 
Q: In 
Riga. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
12
A: -- 1940 and 19 -- 
Q: 1941. Do you have any memories of that
 time of things that were happening in 
the town ? Did you pa
rents say anything? 
A: No, I don™t know. I-I -- I 
don™t have memories, it™s -- 
Q: I know you were very young. 
I know you were very young. 
A: I have memo ries like, I would say, wh
en I went to my  grandfather, yes and you 
know how in a small, tiny v
illage, there were probably 
fleas, and my mother didn™t 
want to keep him overnight ov
er there. And then we went
 back to her village and I 
was running and suddenly a dog bit me on my
 left foot. And then I remember there 
was a circus passing by and the small 
pony was ki -- pulling a -- a wagon, and 
behind th e wagon an  elephant
 was tied up. This I -- I re
member this, yeah. This 
kind of things. 

Q: Yeah. So during that year, between 
™40 and ™41, between -- it had to go -- 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: -- i-it -- yeah, a-and you don™t have any -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- other memories that were upsetting or frightening? 
A: No, no, no, we lived pr
etty good. We -- we had th
e -- my mother w -- and my 
father, they lived really good life, I woul
d say. My mother liked theater. Sh-She 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
13
liked reading and going out. And I woul
d say movies. She could tell you every 
name of a personage in the movie. She liked  arts. 
Q: So until the Germans 
came in, life wa -- 
A: Pretty good. 

Q: Pretty good. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Ho w would you desc
ribe yourself. Again, you 
were very young. Were you 
very close to your parents, we
re you very dependent on them? 
A: Wh-W hen you -- when you 
so small it™s -- especially
 in Jewish families, you 
know how it is when kids are very close 
to their parents and so  it was -- what I can 
say, they very close. 

Q: When it was time fo r you to leave 
-- you were saying how your father, you 
packed  up things and you we
re -- you have memories of 
st -- of bags on the floor. 
What did your parents say 
to you? Why -- what did th
ey tell a young child why you 
were leaving? 

A: No, I-I -- I don™t remember this, I-I -- 
I can™t say nothing because I -- I don™t 
remember wh -- if they said
 anything to me or not. The only thing I know my  
mother told me, that my
 father didn™t want to leave. 
She said he told her, maybe we 
will overcome this situation, you know. Bu
t my mother loved me
 so much, and she 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
14
never believed that -- that we™re going to 
be safe with the Germans. And so she 
insisted of leaving, yeah , th
is wa -- I -- I know for sure. 
Q: So it was her -- 
A: Yeah, her. My father was a m -- my fa
ther maybe a -- he was a smart person, I 
know that, but in th is case, maybe he 
was a little naïve about -- like many -- so 
many people. 
Q: Did other me mb ers of your ex tended fami ly leave with you? 
A: You see, as I told before, my mother™s 
sister and -- and her brother, they lived in 
Skundaliena
 in next big town  called 
Daugavpils
, and my -- my – I™ll call it -- my 
mo ther™s uncle had seven kids -- 
seven children. Their name was
 Kuperschmidt
 
and then the -- they remained in 
Riga 
with all -- with all seven kids and ob-
obviously they were killed. And my
 grandfather remain ed in his town
 Barovka
 and 
he was shot. My mother™s sister, h er name was 
Dwara. 
In Russian they
 used to call 
her 
Vera
. Sh e was kept alive with her son, 
as my mother told  me, for awhile, 
because she was a translator for the German
s, translated from Ge
rman into Latvian 
and Russian, I know this. And 
my ol -- uncle, with his wife -- yeah, ma -- my  -- my 
aunt, she was married in 1935 or
 ™36 and her to a person named 
Opanansky
, who 
was sa -- later in Soviet army, and he wa
s killed in action. And she -- she had the 

small child, two years old, so was -- she 
was killed in -- with 
the small child, two 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
15
year old male. And my  u-uncle, he 
was shot in the -- in the fortress o f
 Daugavpils
 
with his wife and the three year old to
o -- male child. And then I had the -- my 
grandmother™s sister, on my  mo th er™s side
, sh-she -- she didn™t 
have her own kids, 
but she -- she married to a person who had 
his own four. But two of them escaped. 
One of them actually, a woman, I don™t 
remember her name, she w as a communist. 
And in 1937 the -- she wa
s caught by Latvian police an
d probably  wo rked  over 
good in the prison. And then th ey pr
obably released her and sh e went to 
Russia
. 
But you know what happened in
 Russia
 in 1937. So  they  -- they grabbed her and 
sent her to 
Magadan. 
She got married in 
Magadan
, f-far eastern 
Pacific 
Ocean, 
she got married. And I saw her in 1957, she 
had a son. And sh -she spent 20 years in 
Magadan, 
from ™37 to ™57, it was precisely when I came from the army and I saw 
her. It was strange that she never blamed 
the communists for her mi sfortunes, which 
was very strange. And my  grandmother™s 
si-sister, as I men
tioned, they were 
busin ess people, dealt in lumb er 
and had properties 
and houses in 
Daugavpils, 
so 
everything gone. I even remember my f -- my
 uncle™s building had 
three stories in -- 
on
 Riga 
Street in 
Daugavpils.
 It stands now. 
Q: Speaking of the communist 
party, when -- before you left
 Riga
, and did that 
word  mean anything to you as a ve
ry young child, the communist party? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
16
A: No, if you ask me about the communi
st party, it never meant to me nothing 
because I -- a -- a -- nothing at all. The onl
y th -- I began understanding wa -- the co 
-- what is it probab
ly  when  I was nine, and I bega
n s-seeing the pictures of Mr. 
Stalin
, because before that I -- I -- I haven™t 
seen these, I never 
read nothing. There 
was no time for reading. 
Q: Before you left
 Riga
, had you heard of a man named 
Hitler
? 
A: No. I never heard th -- I don™t remember. 
Q: So it was just the three of you who le
ft, your mo th er, your 
father and you, and 
getting on th e train.  
A: As -- as far as I can -- as far as I ca
n remember o -- for my
 family only. No, I 
would be wrong. I forgot my -- my father™s
 sister. She -- she was with us, too. Four 
people. 

Q: And you were together in one car? 

A: Yeah, we were together in one car, we went to this 
[indecipherable]
 an -- a 
village called 
Pol™kino.
 What is interesting, then we
 met over there a family, they 
were our neighbors. They lived next build
ing from the yard acro
ss this. Their last 
name was 
Pantz. 
We met them in this town
 -- not town, it™s a village, 
Pol™kino
. 
Because I was wounded my mother had to 
carry me once a week or whatever to a 

docto r about eight kilometers 
aw ay for bandages. It™s an interesting story there. My

father and some of his friends, they -- they 
tried to catch some fish in the river. And 
you know what? After all th
eir efforts, they caught on
ly one fish. One fish, I 
remember this, one fish. A
nd why I remember that very
 good, because now my  -- 
my daughters-in-law father, he came from 
Byelorussia --
 but actually, it™s not like 
that. My son went to -- with his wife to 
Byelorussia
 with all his fishing equipment 
and I telled -- I tell him, you know wh at my
 son, you will not catch one fish over 
there, they ate it, 
everything. So --  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Michael Lin. 
This is tape number one, side 
B
, 
and you were talking about the fishing. 

A: Mm-hm. The -- th -- good en
ough, my son 
returned from 
Byelorussia
 and he 
told me, I did catch one fish. 
Q: Just to get back to that beginning 
train ride, did your -- did you have enough 
food, what was the cond
itions like in the car? 
A: We lived in the village 
Pol™ki no 
for a short time, maybe f -- 
Q: No, no, no, I was talking about that tr

A: Ah, out of 
Riga. 
Q: Did your mother -- di
d you have enough food? 
A: Yeah, but this was -- 
oh, okay, on the train from 
Riga
 after we got bumped, we 
left these th ree railroad cars behind and I-I don™t rememb er precisely, but it took us 
very short time to reach 
Yaroslavl. 
Q: What -- were ther -- was this a train car with seats? 

A: No, this was -- as I mentioned before
, this was a train , a mixed train with 
civilians and military. So -- 

Q: But did you have seats to 
sit on, did you have benches? 
A: Wa -- yes. It was -- those 
cars were called, I remember, 
Pullman
. You probably  
have them in 
United States
, it™s what kind of here. It
™s regular passenger c-cars. 
Q: And how did you sleep? 

A: We slept on benches. They
 have just benches, that™s
 it, nothing we -- no pillows, 
or mattresses or something like that, no. 
Q: Did you take -- you were very, very y
oung, did you take anything special wit h  
you, a special toy, somethi
ng you wanted to  play with? 
A: No, I-I think we didn™t have any time for 
taking more valuable things than toys. I 
don™t think we took anythi
ng with us besides just a few things, as a -- as I 
mentioned before. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

Q: B-Before you left, did -- did the word 
ghetto ever -- was that ever mentioned? 
Did it ever mean anything to you? 
A: No, I wouldn™t say that the word ghetto
 ever meant to me anything, I -- I don™t 
remember.  

Q: So you left before the 
ghetto was established in 
Riga? 
A: Obviously I left before the ghetto wa
s established because as far I know from -- 
now I know from literature 
that the Germans entered 
Riga
 about July first, 
probably . And then  we 
left with the last train , what can it be, 28
th
 of June? So  there 
was no time to waste and we had to ru
n for our lives. That™s how it was. 

Q: So yo-you -- you™re sayingyou left the end of June? 
A: Yeah, twen -- yeah, I left 27
th
 to 28
th
. This was the last train, I -- I thought I -- as 
far as I have in my mind.  
Q: Why do you think 
your mo th er knew enough to  leave? Well, how do you think 
she knew? I know th is is looking
 back, obviously, as an adult. 
A: Yes, well I -- I -- later -- I-I can think th
at my  mo th er is a 
-- was a woman -- she 
died already -- she was a woman of perc
eption. I think she was a very bright 
woman. And besides, my  mo ther mentioned 
to me that of course she s -- learned 
everything, she read newspapers and liste
ned to the radio. We -- we knew what™s 
going on in -- in 
Germany
 and 
Poland
, it™s obvious. And besides, w-we had the 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
20
relative, I think, my mother mentione
d him. Very removed, but he was a 
[indecipherable]
 I think, in 
Lithuania, 
I think, a 
[indecipherable]
 you know, the 
chief -- yeah. And he predicted that -- of 
course, I don™t know how they predict, but 
they know what they  
talking about. So we knew very well.  
Q: Did your -- now you™re in 
Ya ro slav l
, what -- h-how -- did your wound heal all 
right? 
A: Yes. Yes, in this 
Pol™kino
, it took me ow -- actually, I™ll tell you, maybe. You 
know, with this primitive medicine, they 
patched up my  wound so
 badly that even 
now it™s -- you know. So it 
took me about eight months
 for me to heal it.  
Q: How did your mo ther find you when  
you were thrown out of the train? 
A: I don™t remember -- I don™t rememb -- 
I was on th e ma -- on the table operated. I 
woke up, I see the doctors, my mother sa
w them -- me to o. So wa -- wa-wa -- we 
were all running and the bombs were falling all over the place. And I saw the 

airplanes, they were very lo
w. Actually, it was covers -- fa -- co -- forested area and 
only you could see th -- I would say from 
above, you could see 
the railroad tracks. 
So -- so they can say. 

Q: Were there other children from other families on that train? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
21
A: Yes. I think I had a distant co
usin who was me -- his name was 
Yosef Za ks
. This 
-- it -- maybe I forgot a little bit, 
but my father™s first co usin, 
Riva
 
Za k s
, she was 
with her ch -- with her child, 
Joseph Za ks. 
Y eah, 
Yosef Za ks
, in -- in Yiddish. 
Q: Do you reme mb er talking 
to  him on the train at all? 
A: No. No, on th e train, I -- no, I don™t 
remember. I only m -- I -- met him only in  
1945. She -- she was -- I would say -- this 
is personal, but I would say my  mo ther 
loved me more than she loved her son, b
ecause my  mo ther never gave me away to 
this -- how you say, we call it in Russian language the 
do m.
 It™s called, like for 
orphans. Orphanage. And -- and my  father™s
 first cousin, she ga
ve him away into 
orphanage. So my 
mo th er always mentioned that. Yeah. 
Q: How long did you stay in 
Ya roslavl
? 
A: We stayed o-only for, I think a month. 
I want to say something about -- this is 
not 
Yaro slavl, 
this is 
Pol™kino
, the village. One day I was walking alone, and I saw 
a peasant woman. And there wa -- high in
 the sky was an airplane, I guess it was a 
German airplane. And this woman took o
ff a kerchief off your head  and began 
waving to the German airplane. Yo -- I -- 
I think it was a sp -- how you say, a spy 
plane, yeah, and she -- I remember it. She -- she waved to the German airplane. 
Q: Did you tell your parents? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
22
A: No, no, I -- I didn™t tell this, but I -- I ke
pt it inside there. You ga -- I didn™t know 
what I -- what it is, but lookin
g back I know what it is.  
Q: Did you have enough fo od at that time? 
A: In 
Pol™kino
, yes, we -- we had what to eat -- we
 had what to eat, but if you want 
to know how it went further, our journey from 
Pol™kino
 to cur -- to central
 Asia
, 
Dalino,
 it™s called 
Vallo Furginah, 
we™re -- 
Q: Well, before we get there, 
I just want to talk about -- 
A: 
[indecipherable] Pol™kino
 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: -- you -- you had enough 
food. Where did you live? 
A: We had a -- I remember th-there was a 
two story -- a two story house, I think. 
Yeah, even I remember the 
color, it was gray. Yeah, you 
know, there wasn™t hung -- 
a hunger right away of the first 
days of war. It started later. 
Q: What does a five year old know about 
war at that ti me? What -- what -- do you 
reme mb er questioning your parents? You were
 five years old, you had to leave your 
home, you™re in this new s -- town -- 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 I was not five yet, September would be five. Bu t I don™t think, 
when  we talking about a five year old ha
ving any judgment to judge what the war 
is, or peace, it™s only the minute he feels it, 
in  my opinion, he feels it, what a war is, 
you know, or wh at hunger is
. But I don™t think it -- afte
r awhile, if you, under 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
23
peaceful conditions you have 
bad impressions, maybe if 
you personally affected, 
you know, physically, then 
you probably will remember, but otherwise I -- I don™t 
think so. It™s philoso phical point, I don™t know.  
Q: Did you stay very close to your parents in 
Pol™kino? 
Did -- 
A: Yes, of course, it was my  parents. We
 slept in one bed, obviously, you know. 
Since 1941 til 1944, I slept in one 
bed with my moth
er. That™s it. 
Q: And then you stayed there and th
en when did yo -- how -- for how long? 
A: We stayed in 
Pol™kino
 for ab out a month, I think. And this was already I would 
say end of July, or beginni
ng of au -- August, and then
 we took o
ff from there 
because th-the Germans were moving and 
actually it™s much 
to the north of 
Moscow
, but they were moving qu
i-quick, I don™t -- I w -- I 
have to look up in a -- 
if the Germans reached
 Yaro slavl
, I don™t think so . 
Q: And then you got back on another train? 
A: Yes. We got back  on a train, 
but this was not a -- already not a 
Pullman
, this 
was a cattle train. And we were sleeping
 on shelves, there were no pillows or 
mattresses or something like that and it to
ok us about a month. Actually, we were 
changing trains. In the beginning my  -- my  
mother told me we had the train loaded 
up with coal and we were sitting on the top 
of this sc -- railroad 
car with -- full with 
coal for awhile, until we got another one 
that was empty, a cattle train and we -- 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
24
from there we went all the 
way down to -- to central 
Asia
, as I said. That town was 
called 
Utchkulgan
. A damn ed place, I would say. Damn ed.  
Q: What was it like? 
A: Okay. My father was s
till not in the army. They -- he probably got sick or 
something, they didn™t as
k him til 1943. I remember 1
943 they™d -- 
they -- they 
were all in -- lined
 up and when  the 
[indecipherable]
 came, and they lined up and 
sent him off.  

Q: Bu-But now you™re still -- the th
ree of you are still to gether.  
A: Yes, and my father™s sister.  
Q: Oh, th e four of you. 
A: And my father and me and my  mo the
r, and we lived in a barrack. No, at the 
beginning I would say not, it™s -- was not a 
barrack. I remember 
Ja nuary 1942, we 
lived in a big wooden hous
e. And -- and the hunger be
gan to set in. You know why 
I remember this very well?
 Because there was an 80 
year old person, and he 
probably  had money. And he had the girl
friend who was about 
30 years old, so -- 
and we lived together in one room, 
about maybe, I would say 30 people. I 
reme mb er another thing. He 
had money, so he bought so
me carrots. They dug a -- a 
-- a pit and buried the carrots into the pit 
and covered it so -- some fo od, right? So 

this -- what I want to say, this old ma
n lived with this you
nger woman -- well she 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
25
lived with him for -- of cour
se for food. And suddenly  
this house burned down. It -- 
I remember snow in central
 Asia
, snow. January there, snow. And then -- it was ™42, 
yeah, we moved to a barrack. My mother wo
rked at the factory that used to make 
ropes, and she would leave 
me alone, obviously, in the 
barrack. Yeah, I was bitten 
by a scorpion at night once, in my left le
g, and my  father once reached into his 
pockets at night and got bitten in the -- 
in his hand. I would say with food the 
situation was so bad, if I tell you th at I didn™t see any milk for four years, you 
wouldn™t believe me. And br
ead, they used to make 
it from a little cornmeal, how 
you say, the dark, dark  bread, mixed 
with -- we call in Russian language
 mich
. It™s 
a -- parts of sunflower seeds, but they™re no
t sunflower seeds, it™s the -- the waste of 
sunsower
 -- flower seeds, because you could see the -- 
Q: The hull. 
A: The hull -- hulk. No, hull -- 

Q: Hull. 
A: Hull? 
Q: Hull. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: The outer part of the seed. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
26
A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the -- the hull mixed t
ogether, it was kind of bread that he was 
yellow in side. In 1941 I™ll tell you -- we were
 going to sit here for a long time -- 

Q: Good. 
A: In 1941 I caught malaria. Yes. An-A nd 
lucky fo r me -- and then  I had a little bit 
pneumonia too, maybe in light form. I thou
ght I™m going to die, I said my mama, 
I™m dead. I remember she began cr
ying and all this, but survived. 
Q: Wh-Where were you living then? 

A: Then, in
 Utchkulgan
. No, th -- no, this was not 
Utchkulg an
, this was 
Andejan. 
This was 
Andejan
. And luckily for me, my  grandmother™s brother lived there with 
his daughter-in-law in there -- and -- hi-his
 daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law™s 
daughter. This I have to tell you, his name was 
Moskevich. Velville Moskevich, 
Velville.
 In Russian language they  call him
 Vladimir,
 but he was 
Velville. 
Actually 
we would say wo lf in Yiddish. His son 
was a famous flyer, everybody knows him, 
Yakov Moskevich
, a general and commander in chief of Soviet Air Force. Two 

times hero 
Soviet Unio n.
 As we know, he was arrest
ed in 1941 and with other 
generals, and shot. So  -- but in 
Uzbekistan
 wh ere I lived in, they probably didn't 
know about the situation with
 him yet, so they supplied 
food to -- to his father. S o  
it™s how we survived, because they didn™t 
know of the situati
on. But later on they 
arrested his daughter-in-law and sent her to
 -- to far away places, this I know. So I 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
27
survived 1941. So I 
mentioned you about the burning 
down of the house. So , after 
that we moved to a barrack. I would say 
maybe seven families lived there, in the 
barrack. My mother wo
rked at the f -- rope factory, 
suppli -- they supplied us with 
bread, as I mentioned.  
Q: We™re -- we™re in 
Utchkulgan
 now? 
A: Utchkul -- yes, 
Utchkulgan
. Tiny piece of bread, of th
is mixture. Tiny piece. It 
was absolutely piece -- if you -- if you pre
ss it in your hand, I-I think water would 
come out. There was a kindergarten, yeah
, I attended kinderg arten as I remember, 
but the food was, you know, 
a little pea soup. Whole day, 
that™s it. Believe me. So 
my -- my mother had to su
rviv e somehow. She began de
aling -- how you say selling 
and buying fruits, vegetables
, you know and selling and 
buying and sometimes she 
would go into the desert and 
collect tortoises, yes. She had a big, how you say, not a 
hammer, but an axe. And she would discard 
the par -- carapaces and only take meat 
out and the eggs, and bring it in a sack. 
One time she was really
 caught in -- in a 
storm. It w as a terrible storm, I rememb
er an d -- but she brought the sack with -- 
with the turtles, anyway. Sh e got sick, but -- but my fa
ther™s sister, she probably 
didn™t have a strong constitution my mother 
had. So sh-she began actually starving 
to death. On e day she had diarrhea, they 
took her to a hospital.
 And they took her 
hospital -- after she became a little better th
ey fed her sauerkraut soup. And you 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
28
know what it is, sauerkraut
 soup? You eat it, in a few hours you™re dead. That™s 
what happened to her. I reme
mber it was raining, ter-terri
ble rain and my father was 
coming from the hospital and he was 
crying. Yeah, it™s what happened. 
Q: Were -- were -- was your family able to bury her? 
A: I-I don™t remember actually, I will tell 
you. I don™t remember how they did it 
because they didn™t take me 
with -- with them. So -- 

Q: What was your father doing? Was he working? 
A: Yeah, my father was worki
ng. In the beginning, I don™t 
know wh at he did. In the 
beginning we -- we™re together with the 
Buka ra 
Jews, you know, 
Buka ra
 Jews, 
they used to have collectiv e farms over there, they used
 to go to s
ynagogue over 
there in b -- with the 
Buka ra
 Jews, but later I don™t -- I can™t say that I remember. 
Go -- in 1943 he was drafted to -- into
 the army  and he never came back. And 
[indecipherable]
 when I lived in barr
ack, the situation was so bad about -- I think it 
was about like 
Ethiopia
 in modern times. I -- I was then seven years old, a-and a 
young guy maybe 10 years ol
d lying on the floor on a ma
ttress, and you -- he was 
squirming like, because he was dying. And 
I was with him together in this room. I 
remember getting so scared I crawled al
ong the wall and bolted the door and ran 
and ran til I -- I don™t know for how long I ra
n. I stopped and I -- in a few hours I 
came back and I remember so
me me-medical personnel, of course not in a car, 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
29
medic -- some medical personne
l gave him an injection, 
I think and he died over 
there. He was swollen like three times his 
reg u lar size, I -- I™d -- I th ink so, yeah. 
Q: So while you were there, you 
said you went to kinderg arten? 
A: Why did I -- why -- 

Q: When  you were there, 
you went to kindergarten? 
A: Yes, I don™t remember what year I went 
to kindergarten, but probably  it was ™42. 
For awhile -- I didn™t even go fo r a long tim
e there, because you know, there was no 
-- there was no food over there, no -- 
Q: Were you parents ve
ry comforting to you? 
A: Well, everything they could get, they
 -- what can I say about my parents? The 
best in the world. 

Q: I-I was just wondering what you tell 
a young chil -- what a parents says to a 
young child going through su
ch traumatic ex perience. 
A: I-I don™t remember actually, I™ll tell you. 
F -- my -- of course my mother, what 
can she do? She comfort you and the -- if 
there™s no food you -- what can you do? 

You want a piece of bread, but
 how to get it? So when 
we had these turtles it was 
already a holiday, right? But this was alr
eady when my father 
was in the army. I 
reme mb er it when sh e began going into
 the desert to ge
t these turtles. 
Q: How long -- how lo
ng did you stay in 
Utchkulgan
? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
30
A: In 
Utchkulg an
 we stayed til 1944, when 
my mother got news from 
Ural 
mountains -- beyond 
Ural 
mountains, it was the cor -- 
valley -- it™s not a valley, 
actually. Beyond the 
Ural 
mountains there was a town called 
Tavda.
 So in 1944 -- 
you know, I had nothing to w
ear, because we lived in a 
s -- I -- I -- actually, I was 
sick for three years with 
malaria, right? I got some 
quinine, right? I reme mb er 
sitting on the -- in 120 degrees 
Fahrenheit
 sitting on -- on the -- on the stone and 
shaking. You know what malaria is? Afte
r th ree years of malaria? S o , my mother 
got the news that my father™s firs
t cousin, he was a -- a soldier in 
Ta vda
, there was 
a -- a prison for -- maybe for all kind of pe
ople, political and the criminal elements. 
And they  called her to come over there. So
 I had nothing to wear so my  mo ther 
knitted something for my feet, an d it was 
December already. You know, I had to 
wear this. We stopped over in 
[indecipherable]
 town, right? Now it™s probably 
called
 Orenburg
, if I can remember. I look out th
e window -- you k
now, we took a 
train, right? We come to 
Orenburg
. We stayed only there, 
my  mo ther had to look -- 
somebody to ld her ma ybe my  father is aliv
e, because she got the news that he was 
released from the army  because of sickness,
 but she couldn™t find him. We stayed 
over -- the wind was sweeping -- this is an 
open plain, no forest over there and the 
wind was sweeping so horribly that my  mo th
er couldn't  take it any more, so we -- 
we boarded a train to 
Swedlofska
 and from there to 
Tavda
. I™ll tell y ou, we had the 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
31
very 
[indecipherable]
 small luggage. There was no -- no luggage, actually, and she 
placed it on the -- on the floor and somebody 
wanted to steal. So my mother was 
pretty alert, she gave him a -- a kick in
 the behind so he fell in -- on the railroad 
tracks, I remember th at. When we boarded 
the train -- of course there are no toilets. 
There are toilets, but you know
 what, no heat. So the huma
n excrements and all this 
urine, was frozen and piled up I would say 
maybe three feet high. Yeah, and that™s 
how we traveled to 
Tavda.
 This was not 
Tav da
, it was called a town, 
Sa ra golka
. 
You see, I remember all the names. Yeah, it was
 Saragolka
. 
Q: Wh-What was it like when your fath
er was called up into the army? Do you 
remember that? 
A: No. I -- I -- I wouldn™t say that I reme
mber. I only, when I -- as I mentioned, I 
saw him lining up on the -- on th e sk
 -- square of this town, and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: D-D you rememb er missing 
him and asking where he was? 
A: I don™t rememb er missi
ng or asking where he was. 
I-I -- I don™t -- I can™t say 
that. I -- I-I don™t remember. 
Q: So when he left it w as just th
e two of you, you 
and your mo ther? 
A: Yes. After he left, my aunt died, just 
me and my  mom, and that™s it. Two of us. 
Q: Did you mix with other children 
at that time, when you were in 
Utchkulgan
? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
32
A: No, I wouldn™t say that I mixed with 
any other children, I was by my self. By 
my self all day. You know -- you know the two -- 
Q: What -- what did you think about? 
What did you do to occupy your mind? 
A: What did I do to occupy
 my mind? I was looking fo
r food, and you know what? 
I remember this case -- you see, I am shav
en now, right? I am 63 years old now and 
I am shaven. It™s how I was 
shaven wh en I was seven or eight years old. So  what 
did I do? You know p-peaches -- 
actually not, apricots. And the 
Usbecks,
 of course 
they had their orchard in somewhere else
 -- there was a market
, sur rounded by a 
high wall, as they do it in 
Asia
, was a clay wall. So one time I stole a -- you know, I 
stole a me lon from one 
Usbeck,
 and he ran after me with 
a n -- with a knife. But he 
-- of course he couldn™t catch me. And th
e -- in the corner I remember there was a 
bank, and the bank had a nest of wasps. Ye
ah, the wasps, of course, the melons are 
not like in this country, th ey are a little bit be -- sw
eeter and better. The wasps has 
very sm -- good smell, ri
ght? So they attacked me 
and bit me se -- I di -- I 
reme mb er s e v e n  times in  my  h e ad . S o  my  h
ead had big bump s. Then I -- in order to 
survive I collect -- I of -- of course I dr
opped this melon, what
 could I do? And in 
order to surv ive I would pick up the seed
s from apricots. But a -- I remember b eing 
ashamed doing this, so I wouldn™t do it be
nding, with  my  hands, but I would pick 
them up with my feet. With 
my toes. With my toes, yeah
. And collected them ca --

then coming home and taking a -- a stone an
d breaking, and th ey were nutritious. So 
-- so I ate like the s -- the seeds.  
Q: Why did you not have 
any hair on your head? 
A: You see, during the war we had the la --lice. In order to get rid of them we had 
to shave our heads.  

Q: Wh-Who did that for you? 

A: I -- I actually don™t remember who -- who shaved my
 head, you know. 
Q: Was that hard for you, as a small child? 

A: No, I had no feeling there about having
 hair or not having hair, probably  the 
same I don™t have now. I don™t rememb er
 having any feelings about styles. 
Q: Did th at hold true for your mo th er too, 
did she have to  have her hair taken off? 
A: Oh no, my  mo ther never shaved her head, no. Sh e didn™t do it. 
Q: So now, your father ha
d gone and your -- 
yo-you™ve moved -- you™ve continued 
on your journey. 
A: Yes, we came to 
Saragulka
, was December 1944, and my father™s first cousin, 
his name was 
Ulman
, 
Schmul Ulman -- Schmel Ulman, Schmel, Schmel
, yeah. 
And my grandfather™s sister, my -- my f-fa
ther™s side, she was there too with her 
daughter. And it turned out that 
Siberia
 was much better than central
 Asia
 in -- as

food is concerned, because my mother
 began work ing, no
t chopping wood, but 
sawing wood, you know, big logs
 of -- she worked all day. 
Q: How had your mother™s health been up to
 that point? 
A: You know, it™s very interesting, my mo
ther™s health was ve
ry good. She was a 
very strong woman despite later starting to
 comp lain about high
 blood pressure or 
something, but I rememb er she had her -- 
her -- when she was younger, she had her, 
you know, w-women™s characteristics a little
, about -- complaini
ng or something, 
but actually her health was pretty 
good, considering the horrible times.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Michael Lin.
 This is tape number two, side
 A.
 I 
just wanted to ask y
ou, when  you were in 
Uzbekistan
, were -- did your mother 
know wh at was happening in 
Europe
, and if so, did sh e talk to you about it? Did 
you as a child, have any idea of wh at wa
s happening with the war, and th e Jews 
also? 
A: I-I -- I w ould say I-I can™t recollect if sh
e was talking with me about the war, and 
these other things. The -- mostly we were ta
lking about food, I think. To me was, at 
least the -- but what was happening, of 
course she knew wh at was going on, but she 

never talked with me about 
the situation, I would say. 
And I never attended school 
yet, I was in a -- I don™t think I had any 
strength to attend any school. I was young 
til then from -- I began going to school, I was only eight years old. 
Q: Okay . You were living un
der these terrible times, under these terrible conditions. 
Did you -- and -- and 
did you feel very Jewish? Di
d you -- were you angry that 
these sad times were happening to you b
ecause you were Jewish? Did any of those 

thoughts come through your mind? 
A: You see, the -- I -- I didn™t know what
 Jew and not Jew is. Later on I real -- I 
understood what a Jew is or not a Jew, 
but at a young ag e I probably  didn™t 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
36
understand what it is, what -- to be Jewi
sh or not Jewish. I -- I -- I d idn™t know 
nothing about it yet. 

Q: I-I was just asking were you -- in case 
you were angry that 
this is happening 
cause you were Jewish. 

A: No, no I -- I couldn™t say that, becaus
e later on wh en I unde
rstood, then I -- I 
knew wh at it is to be a Jew, but in th -- 
then, I didn't understand. Now, my  mo ther, 
of course, ne -- obviously I -- I don™t even wa
nt to talk about it. But she knew all the 
situation, but she never converse with
 me about this -- what™s going on.  
Q: So now it™s 
December 1944 -- 
A: Yes, it™s December 1944, we come to 
Sara gulka
. Seemed like it -- the end of 
the world. There was a -- a sc -- a school, I be
gan going to school at the edge of the 
village. A -- a s -- a small -- and there 
was a club. S-Strange enough, I began 
performing i-in the club, ju -- reciting 
poetries suddenly, I remember. And s -- 

Q: You were now eight and a half. 
A: Yes, I was about eight and a half ye
ars old. I be -- I rememb er applaud -- 
applauses. I don™t even know where 
I got this poetry from, you know, and 
declamations, you know, this kind. I don™
t even know. I don™t rememb er how it 

happened . 
Q: Did your mo ther recite poetry to you? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
37
A: Probably  she did. My mo ther probably  
said it, poetry to me, because when I last 
saw her, she was close to 85, sh e was s
till reading in German
 and reciting great 
authors. Yes, she had 
the very go
od memory. 
Q: What language were yo
u reciting your poetry in? 
A: Of course in Russian, it was 
Russia
. Obviously . So, Russian language. 
Q: Did your mother -- when
 you were very young, did your mo th er sing you any 
songs? 
A: I-I can™t say that. But there™s an inte
resting case, when I was younger, I can 
remember. Maybe it™s im
agination or something like, 
about the angels. I remember 
was a 
taholim, 
as they say in Yiddish, like a dream.
 But I was lying in  bed, I think I 
was maybe three years old, or four and I 
saw somebody in white
 clothes above me, 
hovering above me, and I -- I-I think it was an angel. And I -- even now, I -- after 
all these years I think that angels exist. 
I remember this, yeah
, it was wa -- I-I n ever 
forget. I tell my -- my sons
 that angels exist, yeah. 
Q: Di -- had your mother sang 
you any songs about angels? 
A: No. I don™t think my moth
er -- she was not a religious woman, so it was a -- of 
course she knew th-the Bible. My father us
ed to tell her stories fro m the Bible. I -- I 
reme mb er this very well, about -- yeah, 
I can -- now I recall when we -- when we 
led me to this. I recall it, about -- about 
Eliyahu
 
Na wi,
 I recall when -- when my -- 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
38
my  father used to tell stories about how he 
u -- would be invisible, go to place, to 
place, help people and all this stuff. I 
-- I recall it vividly now because it has to 
come to me , you know, maybe I have so
mething I forget, but I remember, yeah. 
From the Bible my father used to tell a lo
t of stories to my 
mother from the Bible 
and she would -- yeah . Sometimes you s -- 
like you see dead people. My mo ther 
told me a story, she thinks she saw her mo th
er in the -- in the square. O-Of course I 
don™t believe this, but maybe she imagini
ng, but it™s what she told me. Yeah, it 
happened to her.  
Q: Do you reme mb er your fa
ther conducting any Passover 
Seders
? Doyou 

reme mb er your father conducting any Passover 
Seders
? 
A: Not th at -- I don™t rememb er. I don™t th
ink we would be -- as I mentioned to -- 
when they -- he -- he 
used to go to the 
Bukara
 Jews in 
Uzbekistan
. I was not a 
participant, he -- he would go by himself. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So, I-I -- he -- I don™t think we would 
be able even to 
conduct any Passover 
Seders
 if you don™t have nothing. You co
uld only use your hands, nothing else. 
Q: And -- and no memory of 
Seders 
when you were very young and in 
Riga? 
A: Yeah, I remember -- well, I would not -- 
not say that we -- I have memories of 
Seder,
 but I remember o -- the 
-- when they bought fish
, usually a -- a live pike, 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
39
long pi-p ike, long. And the fish was alive, 
I even dipped my  finge
r into his -- caught 
me by -- yes, caught me, th-the pike caugh
t me, it™s a vicious fish, yeah. Bu t -- 
Q: An-Any memories of sitting aro
und with other relatives at a 
Seder
 table in 
Riga
? 
A: No, I-I don™t have these memo ries, no. 
Q: Mm-hm, okay, we™re move -- we
™ve mo ved forward and you™re in 
S-
Saragulka? 
A: Yes, w-we™re in 
Saragulka
 and it™s wintertime, Dece
mber. You see, th -- 
Q: December ™44. 
A: Yes, December ™44. And it was a much 
better place, at least we started school, 
going to  school in the middle of season. 
And the school was about a -- a sh -- a 
small -- not a building, a -- a house, a wooden
 house in i -- in one -- in one ro om the 
-- the teacher had four classes, starting with
 first and -- to fourth
, yeah. Right on the 
edge of the forest. They 
used to tell me that bear
s are crawling around during 
summertime. Because they had th
is tree they called in Russian
, Kairda
, but it -- it 
se -- they have seeds. In
 Siberia
 they have this -- maybe it™s called
 pignolis
, in 
Italian? 
Q: Oh, 
pignoli
 seeds. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
40
A: Yeah, it™s -- actually it™s -- they look lik
e pine trees, but they  have the seeds, 
very edible, contain a lot of -- of oil, so it™
s very -- so we use -- they used to collect 
this, the autumn time.
 Then  they  used to go hunting 
too. One times -- wintertime I 
saw my father™s cousin with his sold
ier -- fellow soldiers, going a hunting 
expedition, bear hunting. And I don™t know wh
at gratta -- hit me. I w as sitting in my 
shorts, actually. The houses over there are very peculiar. They™re
 very long, wooden 
houses, and the entrance is from b o th side
s, both sides of the houses. So I was 
sitting on the one side, the end of the ho
use and looking through the window I see 
the soldiers going bear hunting. And I -- 
I bolted out th rough the door, it was about 
40 degrees Centigrade, minus, and I jump ed 
on the sleighs, and my  hands and knees 
got stuck to the sleigh, so they had to pu
ll me off the -- the steel. I was crying, of 
course, but they know what to
 do, they put in 
a -- in a big pot they put some cold 
water and they dip your hands 
into -- in this cold stuff. 
Yeah, but it™s very painful. 
So, it was a much bette
r place than in the 
Uzbekistan
, plus they had some dried 
nettle. Nettle is a -- in 
Europe --
 they have in 
America
 or not, I don™t even know?  
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, so you make soup o -- from it, 
in your -- nettle. Then they had potatoes 
and because here the celery, he was a guard
 over there in the prison. And so it was 
much better than in central
 Asia
. But in a few months they -- they  drafted him and 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
41
he joined the army. I 
mean, in the front, he went to th
e front in 1945. So we stayed 
til May 1945, we stayed in 
Sa ra gulka
. And -- and then we t -- went to 
Riga
, but I 
don™t even remember what tr
ains we took, was it the passenger trains or any other. I 
-- I -- I don™t remember. 
Q: Le-Le-Let™s talk a little bit about Ma
y 1945. How did -- th-the war is over? 
A: Yes, the war was over, yes. 

Q: What did that mean to you as 
a eight and a half year old child? 
A: You see, they tell me the war is ove
r, we™re going home. And what can I say, 
we™re going home. I don™t think I had ve
ry -- a reaction very viv -- I don™t 
remember that I had a reaction, 
positive or negative. I don™t -- 

Q: Was there any celebration? 
A: I don™t think we celebrated anything, no
. But j-just casually. We had a patch of 

potatoes, so we sold it, this potato patch.
 Yeah, my mother and my relatives, th ey 
had a patch of potatoes and they  sold
 it to somebody and -- and we went to 
Riga. 
Q: How did you hear ab out your father? 

A: I think my -- my mother had a -- news fr
om somebody. It was not official. It was 

not official, somebody told 
her something, that he™s 
supposed  to come home. And 
he never came. 

Q: Did you miss your father while he wa
s gone? Did you talk about him a lot? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
42
A: No, as I mentioned, I -- I don™t reme mb er
 talking ab out my  father. Me -- maybe I 
did, but I don™t remember. But did I miss him, or -- I d on™t remember. 
Q: Or your mother ta
lk about him to you? 
A: No. I am -- I am telling you maybe I™m
 a little angry at my mother, that she 
didn™t search for him, but she told
 me she couldn™t take it in -- in 
Skalif
 the weather 
was so bad and we sat at the railroad st
ation and th ere™s no fo
od and no clothing and 
no nothing. She couldn™t ex -- possibly to l
ook for him. I remember the wind, it was 
overw helming. So  maybe I shouldn™t bl
ame her, but it™s how -- what it is.  
Q: So now it™s May 1945 and your mo ther™s
 preparing to  leave and to go back to 
Riga. 
A: We™re not preparing, we just -- we just 
left and that™s it. We sold our patch of 
potatoes and took a long 
way from -- it™s not 
Ural 
mo untains, but beyond 
Ural
 and 
we came to 
Riga
. It was in May or beginning of June -- I wouldn™t -- I -- I 
reme mb er passing by, there are a lot of ce
meteries, there were cemeteries, some 
were close to 
Leningra d
. And a lot of German soldie
rs, I remember, buried over 
there, with crosses, cro sses, crosse s, 
crosses, I remember those cemeteries, for 
miles, seems to me. And you can -- the nor
th ern route we took. We took north ern 
route and we came to 
Riga
 in -- in May, yes. 
Q: Did you have any memo ries of 
Riga 
from before? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
43
A: No, from before I didn™t -- I probably di
d, yeah. I remember th e f -- I remember 
vividly the street and I reme mb er this 
bogaden
 as I told you, the f -- the poor house, 
like -- like a church, it was a hospital hou 
-- fo r the poor. I reme mb er the yard, it 
was like a -- the buildings were about five 
stories high, I think, I™m -- and there was 
a yard, and build ings surrounding the yard. I 
rememb er this is -- yes, and the school 
where I stood in  40 -- 1940 in the street, 
Menishnai
 and th -- and the other 
Yikapils 
over there and 
Lascpiesa
 street an d 
Mo sco w
 Street, I -- yellow, in Latvian 
language, it™s called 
yella
. I remember them. They were -- 
Q: Wer -- were you happy about 
returning? Were you ex cited? 
A: No. I-I don™t recall that I was any different from -- you know there was a few 
Jewish families in -- in 
Urals
 and I reme mb er a brother and sister there from 
Harkov
 in 
Ukraine
. And yeah, we did a few things 
that I recall. Yeah, I remember 
-- this I will tell you. One time, what they  
did, they -- they made fo r me like boots, 
high boots, called 
buky
. And one day, it was probably
 January , there was only one 
tractor and one lorry. Lorry is in 
English a truck. And it was disabled. 
Zi lfife
 the 
lorry was. So the tractor was pulling the lorry
 and we kids were running after this -- 
the lorry. And we got into -- de
ep into the forest, everybod
y of the kids they  jump ed 
into the top, I would call it, of the truck, 
and I tried to do it too. So  unfortunately I 
stepped on the -- on the wheel, and the wh ee
l turned and my left
 leg  got under the 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
44
five ton truck. And the kids didn™t see me, so
 they left me alone crying in the forest, 
and you know. So I -- I cr
ied and I called and called 
and called til th e railroad 
tracks. And during the war, becau
se they probably didn™t 
have adults, so a 15 year 
old, about, a girl was checking the tracks,
 and she saw me. She grabbed me, put me 
on her shoulders and brought me home to th
e village. So -- yeah, 
for three months I 
-- I had this swollen leg, but fortunately 
nothing broke. Probab
ly the snow was so 
thick and soft that it just pressed into the 
so -- snow and didn't  break my  leg, no. 
Q: Did you experience any anti -- a
ny anti-Semitism when you were in 
Russia
? 
You said this Russian girl brought you home -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- which was a positive. Did you have
 any negative experiences with the 
Russians? 
A: During my  chil -- early childhood, the seve
n, eight, and ni -- I™ll tell you, the first 
experience in anti-Semitism I 
probably began ha
ving when I was in fifth grade, I 
think, understanding -- un
derstanding what it is. 
Q: Okay, now you™re back in
 Riga
 and wh ere did you s -- where did you and your 
mother settle? Did you 
go back to your house? 
A: No, we didn™t go back because my moth
er went over there and this was alre -- a 
ghetto region. And he -- she reme mb ers sh
e climbed the stairs, everything broken 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
45
over there of -- piled up. So sh
e just turned around and r
un from there. But r -- as I 
mentioned, we left a -- a lot of stuff over 
there. So one day my  
mother came back -- 
I don™t rememb er whether -- our neighbors, 
where they lived then
. She entered their 
apartment alone, and you know what? She 
found -- she had -- in those times there 
was style overcoat with a fox -- en tire 
fox over the shoulde
r, right? You maybe 
reme mb er right? And she found this. She 
found -- she took aw ay the overcoat, and 
the fox. She found a golden  watch. And I think a few other things. And she told  me 
about that. And this is interesting because
 h-her friend told he
r, why you didn™t take 
everything away from her, what
 belonged to you and even
 didn™t belong to you? 
And my mother says, I wouldn™t do that. 
[indecipherable]
 I only took what I saw 
mine, and nothing else. That™s how it is. 
Q: And then where did you settle in 
Riga
? 
A: In 
Riga 
we settled -- they gave us a room on the -- by the small 
Daugava --
 
small  
Daugava up e.
 And 
Dauga upe, 
it™s a -- a river, 
upe 
in Latvian language,
 
upe.
 And there were -- it was a -- a church fo
r the old believers. There is a church 
for old believers somewhere, from 
Moscow
 a small street takes you. And th ey gave 
us a room in the -- in the house that belo
nged to the old believers before. I think it 
was even beyond the walls. 

Q: When -- when you say they 
gave us a room, who was they? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
46
A: Nu -- who gives us? The -- probably th e 
government, probably, or whoever they 
-- who gives you -- you don™t enter the r
oom by yourself, right
? So somebody gave 
you the room. So i -- after the war the si 
-- th e situation was pretty bad with food. 
My mo ther managed always somehow to surv
ive, so she began tr
ading. There was a 
-- a market, you know, in old stuff, 
clotheses
 and all, she sells and buys. Then  she 
had co nnections with th e army . She would get some American sugar, and -- it™s 
called 
tushunka,
 it was -- it was canned 
meat, you know, from 
America
. And I 
remember it was very tasty, very tasty. So
 in 1946 she 
got married. Actually ™45 or 
™46, and he was a -- a soldier, he 
served in the army, his name was 
R a ishstain. 
Raishtain, Hugo Raishtain
. Actually, his name was -- 
Hugo
 is he called hims elf, 
but he -- actually 
Kyos
 his name was. 
Q: When da -- when did you definitely 
hear about your father? When did you and 
your mo ther definitely 
hear about your father? 
A: About our father? 
Q: Well, what had happened  to your father. 
A: About my father, I mean
? I -- I th -- up til now I don™
t know what happened to 
him. My mother thinks sh 
-- that he died on the way 
home. Or somebody -- even -- 
she even mentioned maybe he
 had the -- a little money,
 and maybe somebody killed 
him, or he died -- or he died because he was sick, is what -- 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

47
Q: So you never got any 
definite information? 
A: I never got any info rmati
on about my father, never.  
Q: So your mother remarri
ed, and you™re at school? 
A: Yes, my mother remarried, but he was 
an invalid, actually. He got hit in the leg 
and -- in 1944. 
Q: Were there other Jewish children who 
had returned like you did, and did you 
spend time with them? 
A: Yes, I had, later on in -- already in thir
d, fourth  grad e and I -- I had Jewish kids, 
friends of mine, 
Lotkin, Izzie L o tkin
, Joseph Pomeranzif. 
I don™t even know -- 
Q: Did you talk about what you had expe
rienced with these other children, during 
the war? Did you -- did you as ch
ildren speak about your experiences? 
A: No, I wouldn™t say that I talk with th
em about our experien
ces. The only -- the 
only person I would talk with is -- I mentioned befo re my  --
 Riva Moskevich, 
my  
father™s first cousin had the son, yu -- 
Joseph
. So with him we were friends. He was 
my third cousin, I would say. With him we 
talked about a lot. Bu
t beside that, I-I-I -
- I talked very little with 
my mother. Was -- p robably there was a reason, I didn™t 
like sh-she -- she remarried
, probably, you know. And many times I would run 
away from home and slept in -- underground
 -- you know big buildings, they have 
basements. I would slip -- it™s wintertime a
nd there were gangs, even kids of my 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
48
age, 10 - 12 years old, 14, I join ed with
 the gangs, you know. No t rough stuff or 
some, no, but just we had gangs, called 
spana
 in Russian language. 
Moscow
 gang 
or -- or 
[Russian]
 gang or some -- from other parts 
of the city. So we fought each 
other, you know, with sticks and st
ones and clubs and bottles and those -- 
Q: Did you -- did you feel ve
ry tough because yo
u had been through such a difficult 
childhood? 
A: Yeah, I was very tough, I felt it tough, 
because I™ll tell you, I didn't hesitate to 
use my fist right away. If I didn™t like, or
 somebody bothered 
me, I would use my  
fist right away, bam and th at™s it. I didn™
t know any better, you kn
ow? Very tough, I 
was very tough.  
Q: Well, you had seen so mu ch as a youn
g child, and ha -- and been  through so 
mu ch . 
A: I don™t know what th-the reason, becaus
e I™d been through so
 much, or just the 
character. I can™t judge, but I was pretty tough. I was hit one time by an -- one guy 
hit me with a knife on my chin, a little. We
ll, since -- we run ba
refoot on asphalt, 
since I -- I was -- you know, barefoot, I ne
ver knew what footwear is. I™ll tell you 
the truth, my f -- soles of my feet were so 
thick. I used to like to play soccer and ice 
hockey, you know, so we pl

tried to pull the nail out, it wouldn™t come 
out. I pulled it and pulled it, at last I pull 
it out and a tiny blood appeared. It was by th
e river, I just washed it up and then we 
continued playing so ccer. We swam since 
I w as a ch -- nobody bothered me, my 
mother never 
[indecipherable]
 me where I am. All day I was by myself with kids 
and -- I liked school, I™ll tell you. I liked sc
hool. I wouldn™t miss it because I knew I 
need it. 

Q: Were you with Jewish and 
non-Jewish children in school? 
A: Yes, the school was mixed, and there 
was no su ch thing Jewish or non-Jewish, 
everybody together. And I attended 50 -- Latv
ian 56 school that before the war was 
a Jewish sc hool where my
 father™s first cousin 
Shaina
, she was a teacher there. And 
we lived -- later we got an apartment, it 
was basement ap artmen
t in 1946 
wh en  my  
sister was born, half sister, we got an 
apartment next to the school, it™s called 
Male 
Lacspiesa
, little 
Lacspiesa iela
. I just would climb over the fence and I was in 
school. 
Q: Mm-hm. And did you e
xperience any anti-Semitism in elementary school? 
A: I would say the first time I understood 
what it is -- maybe 
I didn™t understand 
then what it is, but later on I -- I began when
 my  teacher of sports, of the physical 
education, I remember even his name, 
Vasily Vasilivich
, was his first name and his 
father™s name,
 Vasilivich
. Fa -- 
Vasily Vasilivich
. You know, as a kid I w -- I liked

to prank -- pranks and everyt
hing. So one time he takes me by the shoulder and say 
-- and says me -- tells to me, you know 
what? We saved you for -- from death in -- 
Germans, and you behaving like that? I un
derstood right away wh at it me ans. This 
was my first experience with this kind of
 -- excuse me -- garb
age. Since then it™s 
how it went, many times. Of course, I coul
dn™t hit him. I should have, but -- 
Q: What were some of your other experiences like that? 
A: Th--This was when I was adult already. 
Q: Oh. 
A: You don™t -- you™re not interested, or I™ll tell you wh en adult -- 

Q: Well, we™ll co -- we™ll come to that  
A: Yeah. 
Q: But when you were in school, were th
ere any incidents with the other children? 
A: No, when  I was at school, y-you know, 
I wouldn™t say that somebody would say 
kike
 
or so mething like that. Maybe I hear
d somewhere far, but nobody would dare 
to tell me in my face. 

Q: So you felt safe on the street? 

A: Yes, in those times I felt pretty  good
 -- safe, because you 
belong to a gang, and 
local ki -- local persons would never t
ouch you, only somebod
y from outside. I felt 
-- what I want to mention, 
in 1946, this I me
ntion -- I rememb er vividly. As you

reme mb er, maybe some of wa -- you, all 
these German and Latvian collaborators. 
Not -- Germans are not collaborators, like 
Drexel
, but collaborator with 
Dunkel
, 
you know, about 10 of 
them, when they had a 
[indecipherable]
 a trial? I remember 
1946, about February, I went to my friend. 
I was about nine -- le

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with

. This is tape number two, side
 B. 
A: -- all the time my mother was telling me
 about the Germans and Latvians and -- 
and as I me ntioned, I was standing on the corner between 
Lacspiesa
 -- no, it was 
Zi lnow iela 
and 
Moscow iela
, yes. And my  mo ther asked 
me, do I want to go to the 
-- to vi -- vitness -- witness? Witness the 
hanging of the -- of the 10 people, I think 
there were 10 people. I said -- I said no, I do
n™t want to go to wit -- witness. It was a 
-- I remember the -- vividly the day wh
en they were hanged, because it was 
snowing and no sun, the sky was covered 
with  clouds, but it was not dark. An d my  
mother se -- went with my stepfather to
 witness the -- th e hanging of these 10 -- I 
think 10 people. Then he told me what -- how happened. They were brought by 
trucks and then they  was -- they stepped on stools, and the stools were knocked

under them and she -- she was witnessing -- it was on the -- a big square in r -- in 
Riga
 on -- what was it? It™s called  the para
de square or I-I -- I™ll not -- I don™t recall 
precisely how the square, but I reme
mb er the square, it™s very big. 
Q: What was the date? 
A: I think it™s February 1946. My moth
er witnessed the -- the hanging of these 
bastards. 

Q: Why do you think sh e went to  witness them? 
A: I don™t think for enjoyment, but for -- fo
r justice, or it™s supposed to be. Tooth 
for a tooth. 
Q: Did your mo ther at that time, or ev
en during th e war, ever talk about going to  
Palestine? 
A: You see, you -- going to  
Palestine
 you have to be a dedicated person, but -- and 
as you know before wo rld wars
, not too many Jews went to 
Palestine, 
only
 
very 
dedicated, as my uncle 
[indecipherable]
. And you know how people are. When 
they s -- well establish ed in certain place,
 they want to live 
there in this, like 
anybody else. So now it™s 
some thing else, and then
 was something else.  
Q: So you continued on with
 school. You were 10 - 11 - 
12, and what was life like 
for you then? Do you have any specific memories? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

A: No, what to say? It was hard in th
e beginning, you know. 
A stepfather is an 
invalid, he gets unpatient
. You know how much patient you can get in certain 
instances. And he worked. He
 worked, not always, and my  mo ther didn't  have an 
official job, but she tried to -- later on sh
e began -- began work ing in trades. I mean, 
a saleswoman. She wa -- became a sale
swoman, yeah. And th-then 1946 my  

stepsister w as born and we sa -- liv ed in ve ry small apartment. No, I would say, we 

began eating better than befo re and slowly
, slowly, life improved. I remember when 
I was a kid attending this school, first time
 I saw, during the -- the -- how you call it, 

elections? This was a Soviet style election. 
In school they would organize -- I don™t 
know, it was specially fo
r new republics, like 
Baltic
 Republic, where it was als -- 
also 
[indecipherable]
 I™m not sure, but over there 
I -- they would bring artist and 
singers and all kinds of stuff and all day 
they would play mu sic and -- and praise 
Stalin
 and all the party and we used to watch 
it, enjoy it actually, I would say. You 
know, everything is good fo r a peasant. 
Q: Were you part of any Ru ssian youth group? 
A: No, I would say I was never even not a 
peer -- Pioneer. They 
used to force you 
to become a Pioneer and wear 
this -- how you call that, tie. This is like a tie and in 
public maybe I would put it on, but then I 
would take it off and put it in my  pocket, 
because I never wanted  to be a part of it.
 I don™t know, it was mainly in -- inside me 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

that I didn't want to be a me mb er of a
ny organization, even from childhood. Not a 
Pioneer, later on a 
[indecipherable]
, later on a party memb er. I know many Jews 
were party members, I -- I have friends that live in the 
United Sta tes
, a lot of who 
were party memb ers, but I, never. I felt I don™t belong there.  
Q: Was your mother a member?  

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: Or your stepfather? 
A: No. My stepfather was a Zionist befo
re World War 2. Of
 course, he never 
mentioned, you know 
[indecipherable]
 were a Zionist, what happen to you. 
Q: What would happen? 

A: If you were -- what would happen? Will 
go to faraway places, is what would 
happen. So, you know, I-I 
[indecipherable]
 but in a quarrel, let™s say my mother 
would quarrel with him. And 
she would give a hint that he was a Zionist, he was 
scared, you know. Obviously my  mo ther wa
s joking, but you see, Zionist is a good 
cause. It™s why we have our country ther
e, and he was a Zionist and didn't want 
anybody -- he belonged  to a sports club and he was, himself from 
Rezekne
, andhis 
-- two of his sist ers, they went to
 Palestine
 in 1933, but his mo ther and two br -- an 
older brother, they all were killed in 
Rezekne
. So -- and he always dreamed about 
coming to 
Israel
, so they managed to come to 
Israel
 in 1966.

Bar Mitzvah
? 
A: No, nobody gave me 
Bar Mitzvahs,
 nobody gave me 
Bar Mitzvahs,
 no, I don™t 
know. I don™t rememb er. Yes, when I -- I was 
Bar Mitzvahed --
 I don™t remember, 
but I -- I was in Jewish circles because my
 father-in-law had his cousin  and the -- 
the cousin had two -- 
Q: Your st -- your stepfather. 

A: Yes, my stepfather over there. He had 
a cousin , he was an invalid too after the 
war, who got hit in the head. And he had 
two daughters and a son. Yeah, and they 

really wa -- 

Q: Was it safe to be outwardly Jewish in 
Riga
? 
A: Outw ardly? 

Q: At that time. 

A: You say outwardly, nobody wore beards, 
or didn™t wear -- I never seen anybody 
wearing Jewish uniform, you k
now, I recall the black stuff.  
Q: Did you do anything religious
ly in the late 40™s - 50™s? 
A: No, I never did, despite
 that my father was a 
Chabadnik. 
My father, personally 
was a 
Chabadnik
 before war. You know 
Chabadnik,
 in 
Israel
 they have this. But 
I personally, no, I was not religious. I -- what
 to say about religion? I believe that I 
am a Jew by blood. I don™t have to 
be very religious to confirm it.

Q: So th en you went on to high
 school. Any experiences there? 
A: Yes, I went to high school -- a-actually
, you see, he was not my father, right? So 
he always insisted that I go 
to work . I was 13. Go to work
, go to work, but I want -- 
I wanted to study. I wanted to study an
d I went -- actually I went to school 
evenings, high school. I went to work, I wa
s a lathe -- lathe operator, worked a little 
here, a little there, you know, what do you wa
nt, you were 13 or 14
 or 15 years old, 
you know. And that was t
ough actually, in many ways, 
obviously. So one time I 
worked at the big factory, th
ey used to build floating cr
anes over there. They -- and 
you know how in
 Soviet Union
 is, they you -- they s-send 
you to collective farm to 
work summertime. S o  I am 17 years old, 
they send me to a collective farm. T h ere 
was about five people, or seven people, maybe. One Jew, engineer, me, 17 years 
old, and ab-about five 
schlubs. 
Big, huge. Out of the army
 already. You know what 
-- what they  did to this engineer? They  ac
tually treated him like piece of dirt. All 
the time, kike, kike, kike to him, and he 
couldn™t do nothing. He was a -- a weak 
person. It what my opinion is he looked
 weak  and he behaved weak . I didn™t say 
noth -- a word, but one day we
™re sitting by a table, the 
engineer was not there, 
these five guys and me. And you know wh at
 he says -- one of the guys tells me? 
Hey, hey you, kike, give
 me th e - -  p ass me t h e 
leffel. L effel,
 he need a sh -- a 
spoon. Pass me the spoon. I don™t know wh at
 hit me. I -- I jump ed up, ran toward 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
57
the guy and hit him with my le
ft, right in the jaw, right in the bloody jaw. He fell on 
-- on the floor, right? He fell on the floor an
d then he got up and tried to jump on 
me, but the others, they -- how we say, th
ey s-stop him. So  they separated us, but 
we lived on the -- how you call it --
 sarai
 in Ru ssian language, how you call -- with 
this hays -- haystack? How you call it, barn
. Yeah, we lived on th e u-upper part of a 
barn, in the huge barn . So I was afraid to
 go to sleep. We slept on the straw, you 
know, there was nothing, just maybe you -- you take from home a blanket, maybe. I 
was afraid to go to sleep. We had to clim
b a -- a ladder. But the -- I had to go to 
sleep, so I collected a lot of stones, maybe 
five, six big stones. I climbed the ladder, 
stepped i-in the opening, and I say, 
now approach me on
e by one. And nobody 
approached me. It was some kind of psycho
logical thing. Nobody approach ed me, I 
throw away the stones and went to -- in
to my corner. And nobody touched me. 
That™s how we tre -- it was 
instinctive, you know what
 I mean? But it™s how a Jew 
should behave with everybody.  
Q: Do you think you 
behaved that way again because 
of what you had experienced 
before that? 
A: I actually behaved like this again, 
and it happened I™ll tell you when, in 1960 -- 
™61. I -- I was a seaman on a fishing bo
at. It was not the fishing boat, it was a 
transport boat actually, the -- named 
Riga
. And we would cross the 
Atlantic
 by

Canadian shores -- how to recall it precisel
y not to make a mi stake -- by Canadian 
shores w -- you know what I 
did, I loaded up barrels wi
th herring from other ships. 
And you wo rked  like this 12 hour
s a day. It was a int -- it was 
[indecipherable]
 of 
six hours and six hours.
 And th ere was one from 
Latgalia
. A guy -- I -- I have a 
picture some of this, but I didn't bring it. He was from 
Latgalia
, a lat -- a 
Latgo, 
and he called me kike. In those -- then, I di
dn't hit him, but I took
 a -- this worn out 
glove, with salty gloves herring and I -- thre
e times I hit him in 
the face, cri sscr o ss 
like this. And this was the end of it. One 
guy approached me a
nd says later on and 
says he could kill you -- you. And I said, 
well, he didn™t. And what is interestin g, 
next year I was going from 
Riga
 to 
Mo sco w
 and th-they stopped at the station, 
right, in 
Latv ia  
over there. And I walking along th e 
train and I -- I see this guy. He 
runs towards me as if I am this best frie
nd. It wa -- you probabl
y have to give them 
a good shot that they rememb er you, right? 
Q: So when you were -- you 
said you went to school at
 night and worked durin g the 
day -- and th-this wh en you -- we™re going 
back in -- years when you were in high 
school. An-A nd then  wh at happened? 

A: No, I worked in th -- during the d-day an d went to high school. I graduate from 
high school and then  I was drafted to -- in
 -- tha -- I want to mention -- yeah, you™re 
-- I am okay, I am okay. I want to mention one thing. Maybe it has to do something

with anti-Semitism. I --
 when I graduate from seventh gr
ade I wanted to go to junior 
college. I always dreamed about becoming a geologist. So, I have a -- I had a friend 
at the 
[indecipherable]
. He was already a student in -- in
 Siberia
 geological 
faculty. And so I was talking with him what
 he is doing and -- and I ask him, wh-
where do you th ink should I go for thes
e courses? He say s, come to us to 
Swedlo sc 
over there. But I didn't want to go cold, I 
remember this, cold. 
So I say, I™ll go to 
Ukraine
, be -- for exam. Well, it was 1952. I 
went -- okay, I send my papers, they 
had invited me for it. I passed the exams ve
ry good. I think I should have became a 
student of -- in
 Kiev
, capital of 
Ukraine,
 but I got a letter that I was not taken, so I 
think i -- there was a reason for n -- me not 
being taken. An-And this ta-tartar told 
me, you will never be a student in 
Ukraine
, he told me himself, my fr-friend. He 
says -- 
Q: This is because you were Jewish? 

A: Yes. He says, come to 
Urals.
 That™s what happened. 
I think it™s better that I 
didn™t go and become a geologist. I -- I fe
el that otherw ise I would be staying in  
Russia
 til now.  
Q: So what did you do instead? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

A: When I came home I go this information 
that I -- so I went to high school, 
because this was junior high school. So in
 1955 I was drafted in the army. So they 
took me -- 
Q: This is the -- the Russian army? 
A: Yes. I was in the Russian army, 
it was September 1955, I think. And -- 
Q: What™s it like to put on a Russian uniform? 

A: First I want to say that I didn™t go to  
college. I don™t know, I didn™t feel like -- to 
go -- going to college. And I -- I went to th
e army , I would say, not thinking about 
anything. So, of course wa -- how they tran
sport you, they transport you cattle cars. 
Later there was no -- any accommodations.  
Q: Did th at bring back any memo ries to you? 
A: Probably. And especially what was inte
resting, one time -- okay, wh-wha -- what 
happened , we were traveling and suddenly
 we stopped. We heard shots. Shots, 
shots, we stopped, everybo
dy began running toward  the sounds. They  opened  wide 
the cattle car, the doors, and they see a sold
ier is lying -- he was then not a soldier, 
in civilian clothes, were not soldiers yet.
 And I see he was dead
. What happened, a -
- a drunk sergeant, he was dr
unk, he gathered all these 
boys together, drove to  -- 
into a corner and began shoo
ting, and he hit only this 
guy, fortunately. So what -- I 
had my first experience with the ar
my. Then we came to a town called 
Perlomiesk.
 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
61
You have a lot of tr-trans
lation to do here. I don™t know
. And we came to a town 
called 
Perlomiesk
 and a big division over there called 
[indeciphera ble]
 division. 
Do -- don™t write this. This 
[indecipherable] 
division it™s called because they don™t 
have a full, how you call, personnel. It™s 
only maybe half or a quarter or whatev er, 
during peaceful times, I thi
nk. So I went to this 
Molodog Bietz,
 it™s called the 
young so ldiers™ training. We lived in ba
rracks, 200 people. The food was, you 
know, we used to call i t 
ka ir za
. It™s like they gave us bo
ots, only they™re not from 
leather, they™re made from some kind of plastic. So we called the food th ey gave us, 
this 
ka ir za
, like plastic it was
 ka s h a
, like porridge. And a little bit of sugar and a 
little bit of meat. Yeah, ever
ybody was hungry, you know
, hungry, I will tell y ou. 
So we spent like this maybe ha -- traini
ng half a year, you run, you -- maneuvers, 
you shoot, you know, and all 
this stuff. You go to  -- a -- a bathroom is about in  the 
middle of the -- we call it -- we call it town over there 
[indecipherable]
 bathroom. 
A big barrack with -- for about 200 people, 
opened  ho-holes over there, and around 
too, everybody urinates ar
ound the barrack. The barracks 
were so cold, it was about 
four degrees Centigrade. And -- and th ievery
? I had hundred rubles and my  glasses, 
I had begun wearing glasses. 
And so I put it under my p
illow, gone. Forget it. You 
know, if you™d -- even -- we call 
p a rtienki,
 it™s not like socks, but a piece of cloth 

you wind around your feet, right? And even  
this would be stolen, if they were new, 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

at least, you know. I-I™ll tell you, two years 
I was in the army, I 
remember going to -
- taking a bath only four times. In the be
ginning we went three times and then  I 
didn™t go to -- didn™t have a bath fo r a ha
lf a year. I -- we were wearing underwear, 
s-summer underw ear. For winter 
they would give us like 
formbika,
 it™s like cotton, 
right? And there was so -- supposed to be
 white, but it was not white, it was earthy 
color, you know, 
black. An -And the 
[indecipherable]
 were all -- the shirt -- the 
green shirt, you -- you would take a -- a knife
 and clean with a knife the dirt off the 
-- you know, to come off. This
 what kind of an army. I 
used to play pretty good 
soccer, and -- but I didn™t want to play 
soccer, you know, no matter how hard  they 
tried to convince me. Swimming, I swam very
 good and I wanted to  get away from 
there, not to stay there.  
Q: Were there a lot of other Jewish -- ve
ry many other Jewish soldiers, and did you 
stay together? 

A: With me, was only one Jew, 
Dick -- Dick Teryoff. 
And th is 
Dick Teryoff
 was 
treated pretty badly. You know wh en yo
u her -- see small peopl
e, short and weak? 
They have a field day with them. But 
I wouldn™t say that anybody touched me, 

because I came, 18 year old, 
I weighed six -- 73 kilograms 
and then in about a year 
ya -- I became 82 and pretty athletic. One 
day my lieutenant saw me naked, took a 
look at me he was oh -- he was a very shor
t guy -- and he look at me and se -- says, 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
63
oh how beautiful you develope
d. You know, I was athletic, I only needed meat a 
little bit on my bones, you know
? But when you are short like
 Dick Teryoff
 and -- 
you were treated like a piece of dirt. 
And besides we had a lot of -- from 
Asia
, Cos-
Cossacks, Uzbeks, 
Chuwash
 from 
Volgar
 region. And I™ll tell the u -- the 
Ukrainians were the worst. Especially I 
remember sergeant Ukrainian. He didn't 
dare to tell me a bad -- bad word, but I -- I 
felt he had something inside. He wanted 
to say something, but he 
didn™t dare to. But those 
[indecipherable]
 people, they 
were called 
churek, chumek,
 and all kind of, you know, word s that they wo uldn™t 
like it, to hear. One guy turn
ed out to be a German over there, and with a strange 
name. His name was 
Ingalls.
 Is it strange or not? Friend of 
Karl Marx.
 And I think 
he was pretty anti-Semitic. A German guy from 
Volgar
 region.  
Q: Did he -- did he a
ttempt anything with you? 
A: No, no, he didn't attemp t to play with
 me, no. He was a big, strong guy, but he 
didn™t 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: How long were you in the army? 
A: I was almo st two years. What happen
ed , in 1956, as -- as -- as you know, or 
maybe know, 
Czechoslovakia
, through
 Russia
 -- or 
Russia
 through 
Czechoslovakia
 began selling weapons. And all the weapons went to 
Egypt 
through port of
 Nikolaev. 
So th ey sent us to 
Nikolaev  
to load the ships. And you

would do 12 hour shift with very  little food.
 I would say th ey wo
uld bring at night, 
if you wo rked at night, they would bring 
you a -- two slices of bread with a cup of 
tea and a piece of sugar. It™s all w h at yo
u would get. And I wo
rked over there all 
summer, July -- it was in June, 
July, August, I think three months. It was this funny 
in-incident in my -- I wouldn™t say incide
nt with me. I was on guard and there was a 
raider on ze -- on the truck,
 Zeil.
 And one -- I was on guard there, and one day, I 
don™t know what hit me, I took my  rifle and 
had -- had the sh -- stick, it™s called like 
a -- it™s like a knife, how it™s called in Englis
h, I don™t know, a knife on the front of 
the rifle. And I hit with this
 -- with this knife, a tire. 
Q: A bayonet, you mean? 
A: Bayonet, right. And I hit 
the -- I hit the tire of the 
raider.
 Then it, I think 
something going to  happen to me. I became
 scared. And they didn't notice. An d 
next few days I was not there on the guard,
 but when I came ba
ck I noticed that 
everything went over the -- overseas. And I 
was lucky enough to escape this kind -- 
they would prescribe me probably 
treason or something, I don™t know. 
Q: Were you involved with
 anything going on in 
Hungary
 at the time? 
A: I™ll tell you. Okay, so -- so we left 
Nikolaev
 in end of summer, I think. We came 
to our base -- and they send -- this was 
October, I think, 1956, they  send us to 
collective farm, to work on 
a collective farm, and we sl
ept in a church, a former

church . They -- they didn't have any electric
ity there. They only 
had electricity for a 
few hours. The -- the gi -- girls would come
 over, you know, with
 soldiers and you 
wouldn™t even see their faces. They used 
to show movies over there and use their 
diesel, you know, so there was some light 
maybe inside there, in the church. Bu t 
otherwise, hm. So, one night, it was maybe three o™clock in the mo rning, they  say 

alarm, alarm. We got up -- it was about 1
50 kilometers from our base -- we didn™t 

ask nothing, nobody asks, you 
have an orderly row. And we came to our base, and -
- and they  tell us some thing happened in 
Hungary
. It was November, October ™56, 
somewhere. And they said -- 
so they took half of our 
battalion. They di -- it took 
only about a day or two, they gave out un
iforms special for battle, battle gear, and 
fortunately they only to
ok half of our battali
on and they  sent it to 
Hungary
, and I 
was lucky, stayed home. And later I -- I 
met one guy and he was wounded in the 
cheek. A -- a bullet went through his -- bot
h cheeks and never 
touched his teeth. 
Q: Were you proud to be in the Ru ssian army? 
A: In those times, you know, I wouldn't  say 
I was very proud to be in Ru ssian army , 
but I actually had no feelings, 
is what I want to say, I ha
d no feelings. I lived there, 
and you have to do what th
ey tell you. And I -- I -- I wouldn™t -- I didn't think about 
it. There is no -- they wanted me to be an
 officer, one time they approach ed me and

said we™ll send you to acadamia
 -- academy in somewhere -- 
Odessa. 
But I never 
wanted to be nobody there. I di
dn™t want to be nobody there. 
Q: Why? 
A: It™s probably -- you know wh at? I™ll 
tell you the truth, I th
ink subconsciously it 
probably had to do with ha
ppened to my father™s cous
in. I knew that no -- no matter 
who you are there, this -- the higher you c
limb, the faster you fall. I had the feeling 
like this. So this wh at -- I -- you know, mayb
e -- I reme mb er my  father-in-law, he -- 

maybe he was proud of
 having a guy like 
Kaganovich
 in the ku -- in the 
government, but I didn™t have such  a feeling because I know who 
Kaganovich 
was. 
If you can™t speak Yiddish, or your own 
language, you don™t 
have your culture, 
what kind of -- you know -- 
Q: Did you feel very Jewish 
when you were in the army? 
A: I felt it, yeah, I felt good 
that I am Jew. I am not re
ligiously, but -- but -- but my 
blood. You know, wa -- I rememb
er when I was younger, when 
Stalin 
died  and we 
had this situation, my 
mother was very afraid.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is the 
United States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer collection 
interview with 
M-M-Michael Lin
. This is tape number three, side
 A.
 And you were 
talking about 
Stalin
. 
A: Yeah, I was talking about 
I remember in
 1953 when 
Stalin 
died, and my  mo ther 
was scared because of the s
ituation, you know, with the 
-- I heard all -- all the time 
about the doctors and the ti -- 
timosh -- 
what her was named, this Ukrainian last 
name?
 Timoshuku
 or whatever, I don™t reme mb er her name. And one day yo -- 
actually I -- I would say 
they were talking about 
[indecipherable]
 being prep ared 
for transportation as to somewhere, faraway places. So that™s why my mother was 
really afraid. One day 
Stalin 
died suddenly. It was March nine, I think or -- or 
earlier. I was skating alone in
 a park, Catholic park in 
Riga
 and I heard this. I had -- 
for me, it didn't bother me at all. I -- I don™
t ev en believe that somebody cried with 
sincerely. Maybe somebody did. For me this
 was absolutely non-event that he died. 
I was skating, then  I come home and my  
mother say -- say -- says to me, what™s 
going to  happen to us? And I rememb er prec
isely what I told her. I say, somebody -
- they will find another one. It was -- was 
my words, precisely. 
This was -- was my 
recollection about the situation with her, was in ™52 - ™53.  
Q: What did you do wh en you left the army ? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
68
A: When I left the army, I didn't  go -- want
 to go to work right away, so I went to 
technical school. I went to te -- actually, I went to 
Leningrad
 Geological Institute, 
but I forgot, I™ll tell you, mathematics, and I -- I couldn™t pass properly. I -- I 
passed, but it was not good enough. It was 
a v ery prestigious institute -- college, I 
would say. So I went to a technical school
, after a year and a half I graduated, I 
went to work. I worked at a power station.
 I worked at a power station and then I 
went to a diesel plant, where I 
met my wife, and my wife was from 
Moscow
 region. 
She was a -- she even used
 to work at the power 
plant in krem -- in the 
Kremlin
. 
Yes, she was an ice 
-- insulationmechanic. 
Q: And her name? 

A: 
Rya Lin
. 
Rya Bramawa, 
her maiden name. But she -- she never saw nothing, 
and her father died in action. An
d they lived in a village beyond 
Moscow 
[indecipherable] Vladimir
, and she doesn ™t know noth
ing about nothing. Noth ing 
at all.  

Q: So you met your wife, and then did -- 
A: Here we go, I met my wife and I d
on™t know if maybe I married young a little 
bit. Was 23 years old, she was 22, we didn
't  have an apartment and we didn™t have 
nothing. And I had -- first we liv ed with 
ma -- my mo-mother and my stepfather 

didn™t want us, so I™m -- I -- 
I -- I make him to want us. 
And then I tried to collect 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
69
some money to buy an apartment during th e 
Khrush chev
 time. You know they 
allowed to buy? So I went to -- became 
a seaman to make a 
little money,because 
you don™t spend it. And my  wife work ed, 
and we bou-bought our own apartme n t, a 
small one in 
Riga.
 And we had the son over there in ™64. But my  parents, they 
always wanted to emigrate to 
Isra el
, and they started very ea
rly apply, and I applied 
too. Oh, it was interesting. 
Q: When did you first start 
thinking about emigrating to 
Israel
? 
A: Oh, I think I began thinking about 1963, 
but I didn™t apply yet. I let my  parents 
apply. They began probably  ™64 to apply, 
or maybe even earlier. You see, I -- I was 
a seaman in a -- on a si -- on a fishing boat, 
right? On a -- then I wa
nted to be in a -- 
on a boat that, how you call a -- how you 
say it? A boat -- goods? To -- to -- 

Q: A freighter? 

A: Yes, I want to be on a freighter. An
d you know tha -- I a
pplied to be on a 
freighter and they never took me. You know,
 there is a reason why they didn™t take 
me. They didn™t want -- they understood 
maybe I run away or something. I 
wouldn™t do this. I was a very 
placeable
 person. I wouldn™t run aw ay and leave my  
parents and my  wife and my  -- this was 
impossible. But nevertheless, you know the 
situation. So  then in  1960 I went to college, nights. I took -- I took shipbuilding 

courses. Yeah, I work ed daytime and I 
took sh -- courses in shipbuilding in 
Russia

five years, nights. But ever
ything til -- diploma, I didn™t wa
nt to take my diploma. 
I™ll tell you the truth, I was afraid th
at they impose a penalty when I leave 
Soviet 
Unio n
, and I felt that wouldn™t be proper that 
I take this diploma. It was mo -- my 
feeling. But my parents, they left -- we 
managed to leave in 1966 September, with 
my  sister, she was then 17 years old. I went to 
Moscow
 with them, and you know, 
they had this embassy and police, a lot of
 police was standing behind. I was very 
naïve probably, or what, I 
don™t even know why. The pol
iceman approached me and 
began talking so  loud. I -- he
 began talking so loud that
 I -- I -- I even asked him, 
why are you talking so loud? I didn't real
ize that he had the microphone probably 
over there hidden. So -- but 
then when I -- we entered 
the embassy, we went to 
some of the persons over there and I see a ma p hanging, of 
Israel
, and it was ™66. 
We -- we couldn™t talk loud over there, so
 in whispers I -- I took a pencil and on the 
map I made the West Bank like this, I surr
ounded the West Bank, I say, it has to 
belong to  us. And you know, fortunately th
e next year it happened . And then  they 
left in 1966 for
 Israel
 and I was applying, applying 
of -- five times. They were 
applying many times too. 
Refusenik
, refuse, refuse, refuse, but -- 
Q: Did you have many frie
nd wh o were applying also? 
A: I know only -- only one, but he was,
 I think he was a -- a activist. I don™t 
remember his last name. He was an active 
-- Jewish activist because one time I -- in

to study Hebrew. And I took this book 
and then I had a friend, he was mu ch 
younger than I am, his -- his mother -- his last name was 
Sefian
. She -- she taught 
mathematics in -- in the co
llege. So with him we studi ed a little Hebrew, you know? 
I began writing a little bit and -- and so  I 
don™t know Hebrew now, I forgot, but I 
can recall, I -- I think. And this guy, 
Sefian
, he was a stu d ent with me too, he 
studied Hebrew with  me.  
Q: So your -- your parents 
left, you stayed with your wi
fe and continued to work, 
and then  -- 
A: Yes, I continued to work -- 
Q: -- and then wh at was your reaction after the ™67 war? 
A: Oh, I -- I always find myself in the -- in cul -- 
K u lh o rz.

older I get, the angrier I become. I don™
t know, maybe not everybody like this, but

A: I am very angry of what™s going on 
in the world, with 
the Nazis, Holocaust 
denial, with this

 RS
 
command, and you will find all these 
SS

A: Before we™re -- I -- 
I spent four days in 
Vienna
, yeah, in the castle, yeah. And

 and allowed us to stay in 
Vienna
 fo r four days.  
Q: Did you ever cons
ider coming to the 
United States
 instead? 
A: No, in  those times, no. In those

. I came 
to 
Israel
, it was March fir -- March third or 
fourth . It was a hot day and I was 
wearing a bla -- black suit. So, my parents

75
Q: What was it like to put yo
ur foot down on Israeli soil? 
A: First of all, I was happy, pretty happy. And so  we came to 
Kiryat Ya m, 
she -- 
they had a small apartment, 
because they were a little 
-- I don™t know, the -- my 
stepfather™s sister brought them to 
Kiryat Yam
 and put them in a small apartment, 
three people, when th ey could get any ap ar
tment they wanted, you
 know? So I came 
to 
Israel,
 I didn™t go to any 
[indecipherable]
 like many other people, I didn™t take 
any loans or something like this. In tw
o days, because my profession was very 
good, I went to work for 
Ka blan
. It™s a private entrepreneu
r. So -- and he put me to 
work 
Haifa Kimikali. Haifa Kimikali
 it was a plant that was built in 
Ha ifa
, a 
chemical plant, and it was just -- they™re
 beginning to  build with a French firm 
together. So I worked there for awhile. I worked there 
for awhile, but then I decided 
-- but there were no benefits. I didn™t ev
en know. I didn™t even know how mu ch I 
get, and I wo rked  24 hours a day many tim
es. And they didn™t pay too mu ch . Bu t I 
think -- I got an apartm
ent, nice apartment in 
Kiryat Shmuel
, and I thought I am in 
paradise. 
[indeciphera ble]
 I considered, my wife doesn™t work, my kid is okay. I 
ma -- make money that I can pay rent. The 
rent was cheap then. I can eat whatever I 
want and still put aside something in the 
bank. So what do you expect? Even I 
work ed a lot, but I was strong guy, I wo
rked . But then  I -- I just -- I had a bad 
experience with my --
 Kablan
, you know 
[indecipherable]
 business, he want to

squeeze out a few. So
 I -- they took me
 Vulcan.
 It wa -- they used
 to build military, 
th-the, you know, duds. You know what 
a dud is, like bomb that -- no, it doesn™t 
exist now, so I can say. So it was like a cast
 iron fact-factory, they  used to cast iron, 
yeah. And I worked therefor awhile, but you see the problem -- and we went 
through a -- this 
Suez 
crisis, you kno0w, ™69 - ™70 - ™7
1, and I -- they never too -- 
took me to -- into Israeli army . I was 
a -- you know, I came 32 years old, nobody 
touches me? I work, but I felt so mewhat -- 
something small, felt like I™m confined, 
you know? I wanted somethi
ng bigger, some -- it™s what my
 feeling was. It was not 
maybe financial, no. Bu t something bigge
r, like. So one day, we -- we had the 
relatives in 
America
, my grandfather™s sister. She 
-- she was here since 1920. I 
never knew about her, but she -- she -- I aske
d her to send me a letter. So she send 
me a letter, I came on a tourist visa
 and -- by myself. A few days we 
[indecipherable]
 here, a owner of a factory, textile plant. So, he hired me. The 
sooner you™re hired -- in those times I 
was making, like I said a -- I would say 
equivalent of our times maybe 15
00 dollars a week, you know, so -- 

Q: What city were you? 

A: It was east
 Rutherford
 in 
New Jersey
. So -- so I worked th
ere since ™72 January  
til ™73 May when  I got -- yeah, I got my papers, you know, through 
Tolstoy

Foundation and they  didn™t charge me nothing. Praise 
[indeciphera ble]. 
In those 
times they didn™t charge me nothing, no. 
Q: And your wife and son are still in 
Israel
? 
A: They™re still there, yeah. 
And then this, you know, I 
think I got my green card, 
right, and I say, I™ll go to 
Israel
, check on my -- I had anot
her son, this guy, who 
was born there, 
Eugene
. So I -- I™ll check -- I buy -- buy a ticket, I h ave my green 
card, I go over there, stay there for a fe
w weeks and then sudd
enly at the airport 
they say, oh you can™t go, you have to go
 through the army firs
t. So they -- they 
took me about fo r six, seven weeks, I don™t rememb er, 
Mechana David
. Now of 
course I was not very  happy, but wh at ca
n you do? They  actually didn™t need me. 
Well, okay, I went through the same mo tions as a young fella, 
Mechana
 
David
. I 
took my oath of religions, and after that 
they released me  and after six or seven 

weeks and I went back to 
America
. Then the papers -- my wife got the papers with 
my  sons, and in  1973 October they arri
ved, and th at™s how we™ve stay here. 
Q: Did they come before the Yom Kippur war? 
A: No. They  came after Yom Kippur war. 
Of course, I was nervous. And I had a 
friend, a older man, so I called up and my
 wife didn™t have any telephone. So 
through upstairs neighbors, 
Ro manian people, I called my wife up and ev erything

was okay. Of course, she -- she spent 
a little time in basement, you know, but 
everything turned  out, you see, we™re 
goo -- we™re si -- where we should be. 
Q: So th en your wife and tw o ch ildren came to the 
United Sta tes
 -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and wh ere did you all live?

both sp -- after a few years she began 
working, I -- I worked -- I am a good 
machinist and -- screw machine. And ma
ybe in the beginning was not as easy 
because my language was not as good enough
, but -- so I didn 't think about going to  
school or something, becoming some con
tin -- maybe engineer or something. But 
the money was good, so I say, ah, hell w
ith it, you wo rk, you make a living and -- 
and my  wife began working an
d she worked nights for 10 
years. She worked really 
nights, from 12 o™clock at night til seven in the morning.

Q: Mm-hm. Can we talk now a little bit 
about your thoughts and feelings about 
what you went through? 

A: Yes. In where? 

Q: Just generally, after the war. Do you f
eel you would be a di
fferent person today 
if you hadn™t gone through 
the ex periences that you did? 
A: If not for the war I would be -- even 
my  thinking would be different, obviously. 
First of all, my father wanted to expand 
his business, one thing. Seco nd, I had some 
talents for music, I think, and I want 
play s -- fiddle. So 
everything would be 
different and pro -- we probably  w

one, I think. So it™s how the situation you 
keep -- it™s hard to say what I would be 
thinking about, but it would -- ev
erything would be different. 
Q: You -- your ch ildhood was very difficult,
 extremely difficult. Do you feel you™d 
lost it? That you never really had a childhood? 
A: I never had any to ys, but I never felt 
that my childhood is lost because I was 
involved in rougher stuff 
like sports, gangs, and you kn
ow, I-I -- I -- I wouldn™t say 
that I miss, you know, what it means to be
 a childhood, to be patted over your head? 
It depends on your way of th
inking, it™s -- I think, right? 
And so I-I -- I -- whatever I 
had, I had, and I can™t -- you can regret or
 not regret, you can™t change it, right? I -- 
I don™t think I have hard feelings like -- 
like what -- about child
hood. The only hard 
feelings I have, what happened to  my  family 
and to all of us, all Jewish people, this 
what I have. That to me pers
onally, I -- I don™t think so.  
Q: Do you think a lot about 
your wartime ex periences now? 
A: You know, when  time passes, you always
 remember the better parts of it, right? 
And the hard parts you 
-- as if you forgot. I 
[indecipherable]
 I -- I th ink so. So I 
reme mb er my  ch ild hoo d  
with -- seems to me 
with a smile, yes. Cause a smile, I -- I 
feel this way.  
Q: This is your -- your postwar childhood? 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

Q: After, when you got back to 
Riga. 
A: Yes, yes, postwar. Well, before I can™t sa y because I too young to rememb er 
very much. But I was very spoiled I reme
mb er and I -- I don™t think I would be -- 
you see, in those times even my  mo ther 
was giving me so mu ch bananas -- can you 
imagine bananas in 
Latv ia
 in those years? Because she was so do-doting. It was too 
mu ch . Ev en  I met o n e wo man  who  ev en  rememb ers h ow m -- my  mo th er was 

doting over me then. So I don™t kno
w, maybe I would be spoiled. 
Q: You™re talking about after the war was 
over she spoiled you 
because you didn™t -
- 

A: No, before the war. 
Q: Oh, be -- 
A: Oh, before the war she spoiled me, not
 after. After the war she didn™t have the 
means to spoil me. 

Q: When your children, when
 your sons were little, and th
e age that you were when 
you were going thro ugh hard  times, did th
at bring back memo ries for you? Wh-
When your boys were four, five, six, se
ven, eight, wh en  y
ou were going th rough 
such awfu l times, did that bring back me
mo ries for you when  you were that age? 
A: You see, when you have 
kids and th ey have -- they
 don™t have to experience 
what I had, you feel happy. And sometimes
 when they me -- mi
sbehave, or don™t

achieve what you wanted them to achieve, you
 regret that they didn™t do it, I™m say 
didn™t achieve. But this is 
a life, their own life to liv
e, you know, if they™ve -- 
everybody has his own character. And you
 c -- you can™t do nothing about. If you 
have a -- the way you born, the way you die,
 it™s what I think. My philosophical -- it 
doesn ™t matter what background you co me 
from, you™re already born with the genes 
that comma nd you what to do. 

Q: But your childhood was 
so unusual, do you not th
ink that affected your 
character, all the difficulties that you experienced? 

A: Obviously. Environment affects everyb
ody, an animal, right, according to 
Darwin
, right, believe it or not. So  it affects your brain. 
Q: Well, that™s why I was asking before
. How do you think that affected you 

growing up, not -- not in wh at kind of jo
b you would have, but just psychologically, 

because you were tested so 
unusually for 
a young child. 
A: I don™t know -- 
Q: Did it make you to ugher? 
A: I can only think about it and say that I 
-- of course it made me tougher. If I were 
-- if there was no war and all these conditions
 I lived through, I 
would probably be, 
as you call in Russian language, 
Mami kin sinook.
 Mother™s -- how we call? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

Mother™s son, or what? Yeah
, just a spoiled brat, yeah. And I -- you know. I have 
something to  say about Christian peopl
e. You see I have a ring here, my -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- and my wife has this. This ha -- ring 
has a history. No t this ring, but the gold. 
My grandmother used  to have a -- a armb and, right? So  -- 
Q: Right, a bracelet. 

A: A bracelet made from gold and pearls, ri
ght? My mother always mentioned it. So 
one day, it was 1952, I think, I coming ho
me -- I was about 15, I coming home and 
I see a woman sitting by our door. A very 
skinny woman. I remember her, she was 
so skinny. She asked me, here 
Chaya 
lives? 
Chaya
, my mo -- my mother. I say yes, 
but my mother wasn™t home, so I didn™t 
let her in. After a few hours my mother 
came from work and -- her name was 
Antya
 and she was of Po
lish origin. Turned 
out she was from my 
mother™s village, 
Skundaliena.
 And we didn™t have a big 
place, so she slept on the floor. Mattress 
was on floor After sh
e left, my mother 
showed me a bracelet, this brace
let. She says, you know what 
Antya  
bought? This 
bracelet. My grand -- my mother, she -- my
 grandmother™s bracelet, she brought it 
from 
Skundaliena. 
She said, my sister, before sh
e was shot with her son, she 
handed over to
 my -- this 
Anty a
, and this 
Anty a
 kept it til sh-she brought it to my 
mother, this bracelet. I™ll tell, this 
Anty a
 was so poor, hungry and she brought this

bracelet to my mother. What 
happened to this bracelet?
 In 1966 when my mother 
was allowed to travel to 
Israel -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Michael Lin.
 This is tape three, side
 B
, and you 
were talking about the bracelet. 
A: Yes, so when  my mother was allowed to  travel to
 Israel
 she took the bracelet 
with her, and in  
Keev -- Tamozhnya
 it™s called, the checkpoin
t, they na -- didn™t 
allow her to take it with her. So -- but they
 were kind enough to write out a receipt. 
So two years later I was traveling to Crimean
 peninsula with my  wife, so we spent a 
month vacationing. On the way back I went to  
Keev
, and the -- and the checkpoint 
the -- I had this receipt becau
se my mother sent it from 
Israel
. So I had this receipt 
and they  gave the bracelet 
back to me. And I knew that I would do -- be going to 
Israel
, I didn™t want to lose it, so what I 
did, I made two wedding rings for me and 
my wife. So it™s how it is, it™s what to 
ba -- story. Bu t I wanted to  emphasize how 
goyim, some goyim are good, good peopl
e. Oh , the other friend of my  mo ther 
Kuiznitz Orway,
 who used to live right on
 
the 
Moscow
 Street, close to 
Rumbula
 
forest where the 
Vulcan
, there used to be a factory, a rubber factory, he used to

work, this g-guy in there, and they we
re witnessing the slaughter of Jews in 
Rumbula
 f -- th-the her -- they probably didn™t
 see in person, but they heard th e 
shots for sure, and they told my mothe
r. And they were g -- very good people. 
Maybe they  didn™t hide Jews because -- but
 as Russian people, they were from -- 
from her village, from 
Skundaliena
, they were very good people. And it™s -- not 
everybody™s a villain. 

Q: Talking about all the terrible massacres 
and pogroms and killings that went on in 
Riga
 after you left, and wh en you heard abou
t them, as -- and wh en you were older, 
ho-how did you respond to 
hearing those -- news of these terrible atrocities? 
A: You see, I don™t re-recall my  reaction 
to this, but I never went to see our 
apartment, old apartment. I™ll tell -- I 
never went to see. I -- I didn™t go no 
cemeteries, no nothing. I -- I felt I don™t wa
nt to see it any mo re, you know? Maybe 
it™s wrong, but it™s how I feel. 
Q: Too painful you mean. 
A: Yes. Because one time when my -- it 
was 1965, we went -- we had -- had a 
Jewish cemetery in 
Riga
, in 
Yugla
 area, where my  grandmother was buried. And 
then my -- my mother™s aunt 
died in 1965 and 
they buried her in
 Jewish cemetery. 
And when I was in the Jewish cemetery 
there was nothing to remind me of my  
grandmother, there was ground. My -- my mo
ther stomped the ground in the place 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
86
where my  grandmother was buried and said, 
here is the place where she was buried, 
as far as sh e could -- could remember. 
But there was nothing, they destroyed 
everything there. So this year -- 
Q: So you have been -- 
you have been back to  
Riga
? 
A: Since when? 
Q: Have you returned ? 

A: No, no, no, this
 was in 1965.  
Q: Oh, ™65. 

A: Yeah. I-I -- I intend to go, but my wife does
n™t feel to o good, so -- I wanted to go 
three years ago, just -- over the phone
 I-I realized that somebody knew my 
grandfather. Old wo man, but this was thre
e years ago. She even mentioned him like 

a 
[indecipherable]
 name, it like -- like a darling name. She called him 
gidelka, 
my  

grandfather, so she was a very old woma
n. I don™t even  know if she alive now 
because she was 87 then, and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What are your thoughts about Germans and 
Germany
? 
A: You know, I have some relativ es who live in 
Germany
, moved over there. As I 
mentioned, my  father™s cousin, who was a guard in 
Ural
 mountains, in the prison, 
his wife lives in 
Germany
, in
 Berlin
. And she has two daughters, one in 
Sweden
, 
and one a -- one in 
Berlin
. She -- they lived there in 
-- from the 70™s, I think. And 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
87
her hu-husband is a dentist and she is an 
owner of some -- what -- my feelings are 
very confused about the situ -- 
Germany
. First of all, of course, they helped to 
build  
Israel
, it™s for -- we know it, money-wi
se, ah -- they must. Maybe new 
generation, they better. Was it only brainwashing, o-o-or else during the 
Hitler™s
 
time? I don™t -- I don™t know, this a -- 
or, weren™t there anti-Semites before
 Hitler
? 
As we say, a dirty pond breeds mo sq
uitoes, no? So it was a dirty pond, 
Germany
, 
that bred these mosquitoes. What I say, a 
lot of people don™t like Jews. You have to 
read history of our people. And no matter 
how hard you try to escape, some people 
try to escape to be Jew, it will not help th
em any way. It™s showed through history 
that even in fifth generation, you will be
 one day hit hard. I 
am proud to  be Jew, 
that™s it. A nd I always said 
I am Jew, that™s it. What 
can I say? Who escapes our n-
nationality? I call it nationality, not just a 
religion but -- because anybody ha -- can 
have a religion, but nationality, it™s one. You 
have certain features, you have certain 
blood, maybe. But religion, it can have any religion. 
Karl Marx
 was a -- a 
Christian, right, considered. What kind of
 feature he had? Everybody -- if you walk 
through 
Mo sco w
, everybody would call him kike, 
take a look at him. No matter 
how hard  he tried to escape Judaism, or Jewish people. 
Q: Have you beco me mo re religious in any way since your experien ces? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
88
A: No, I didn™t become religious, but I am
 proud of our achievements. I am proud 
that we have Bible. I am proud that peopl
e -- that everybody, e-especially in the 
western world has a part of our culture
. Everybody, and they
 can™t escape it. 
Sometimes I even have a fee
ling that everybody wants to be a Jew, but in their own 
way. And this is impossible. So I -- I am
 proud of our achiev
ement. Maybe I would 
like to have m -- cultural achievements like 
the Greeks, maybe in architecture or in 
some other things. Maybe I would be in di
sagreement with the Bible, but actually 
they were different times. You had to take from the pagan wo rld, you had to  take a 
certain people and make them who they
 became. And there was no other way, 

because you couldn't  pray to
 a -- to a statue, right? This was ma -- n o w, of course 
we a little b it we are out of -- separate from religion, it was -- in some ways it g-

gave us the opportunity to 
achieve our greatn ess, actually Jewish people are great. 
Q: How did you impart that feeling to 
your children, about th
e greatness of the 
Jewish people? 
A: I-I -- I tried to knock in their head a
ll the time. My older is not -- you know. 
Maybe he has in his heart, but he -- but my  younger is very proud, and he wo rk  for 

Jewish causes and he went to 
Israel
, served voluntarily in 
the army, worked in 
kibbutz. And this is a different k -- person.
 But my older is more materialistic, y ou 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
89
see. I don™t know how to  express this. 
[indecipherable]
 materialistic too. A lot of 
them, unfortunately. 
Q: Are you more comfortable around 
people who experienced Wo rld War two 
firsthand than those 
of us who did not? 
A: No, it depends on situation. You know,
 I don™t have many fri
ends I would say, 
but I don™t talk -- people in 
America
 they don™t understand,
 many of them. They 
don™t understand wh at it is. They have it 
too fat here. They™re
 only comp laining. 
Complaining and complaining.
 They took one dollar away
 from them, they already 
think that they are hungry. Yo
u see, depends on situation. 
Comfortability
 depends 
-- of course I am happy to see my  old fri ends, we have organization with survivors 
of -- Holocaust survivors from 
Latvia
, so I am a memb er, pay my dues. But -- but I 
know a few of them, one or -- one, two. Th
at™s it, because they™re all from different 
places and older people 
than I am, even. Some 
of them younger, but -- 
Q: Did you go to th e large 
1983 American gathering of Holocaust survivors? 
A: No, I didn™t go to Holo caust survivors. 
You see, those Jewish organizations are 
so fragmented, and it seems to me  I don™
t like many things about this, reparations 
and this, all what™s going on
. Pay the personalities from --
 maybe if you have your 
name in the s -- in the ba
nk, your personal name, you shoul
d get paid , yeah. But in 
general, my  opinion is, it should go to the state of
 Israel,
 everything. I-I have the 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
90
feeling all the monies, it -- where we™re bu
ilding our co untry, that™s where it should 
go. 
Q: How would you descri
be yourself today? Israeli, American -- 
A: First of all, mostly I describe my
self as a Jew. My first love goes to 
Israel.
 I -- I 
-- I™ll tell y ou, even when th
e -- the weather is over there no rain, I feel bad when 
they have no rain, you know? 
And this is first, these ar
e my -- my head is -- it™s -- 
you know, it™s separation of he
ad  and heart. My head is 
materialistic, my heart is -- 
probably  a lot of people like th
is, it™s my -- I™m not the first. My heart is with m -- 
Israel
 and the Jewish people. I know we ha
ve a lot of faults, obviously, like 
anybody else. I don™t say that we are bette
r than an ybody else, but we are peculiar 
people, we™re special. And that™s what it is. 

Q: You were here in the 70™s in the 
United States
 and of course there was the big 
Civil Rights movement that started in the 
60™s here. Do you feel that you, who lived 
through times when your rights were take
n away, and your parents and ev erybody 
else, that y ou have a more -- a bigger se
nsitivity to people whose rights have not 
been addressed. 

A: When -- you™re talking about the bl
ack ama -- African Americans? You -- you 
see, like I said you™re a person, no ma
tter w h at color. If you™re a good person, 
you™re a good person, if you™re a bad pers
on, you™re a bad pers
on. And I didn™t live

through Civil Rights movement during th e 60™s over here, I was in the 70™s. But I 
heard about the Black Panthers, and I -- bu
t it™s a radical organization. I -- I don™t 
think by bullets and wa -- and bombs, youwill achieve too much  in this country , 
because this country , despite its democracy,
 we have a very strict police over here 
and -- and intelligence. I don™t think -- and 
-- and lately I began feeling that -- you 
see, I am a middle class person with a bl
ue collar back-background, right? We start 
in polit-politics now. And I feel that a lo
t of blacks don™t 
like Jews, unjustly. I-I 
have my  philosophy about that. Jewish peopl
e tried to help everybody, they out of 
their skins to help ev
erybody but always it turns out ag
ainst them. It™s what happens 
with us. No matter what you do good for 
them, one day they w
ill say you didn™t do 
nothing for us and you going to  be a Je
w anyway. So  we have to mind our own 
busin ess. We have to be strong, we have
 to  know how to  defend ourselves and I 
think we have to keep  our 
culture alive. I -- I don™t 
say about, let™s say inter-
marriages, or some other things like this
. I™ll frank -- I™ll tell you, new blood help s. 
Because I know in our religi
on we even allow cousins to
 marry, first cousins and 
this is not good. It creates monsters dur
ing generations. It™s why short people or 
weak people or something like this. 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

92
Q: Are there any smells or sights or sounds 
that come back to you now as an adult 
that you remind you of your difficult times
 during the war? Anything th at triggers 
your thoughts about the war time? 
A: Yes, I™ll tell you. I don™t think it™s right 
to dislike people of -- Latvian people of -
- in general. But I have the feeling that 
they -- they wronged 
us. They  wronged us 
and during 
Ulmenist
 time it was pretty good. You kno
w, we had cu lture, we had the 
-- you could do anything you 
want. But probably -- the fascists are fascists, they 
always felt the -- with the help 
of Nazis they tried to achieve 
Ju-Judenfrei
 country , 
you know, so -- but this is not the first 
time, and I hope it™s the last, but I™m a 
pessimist about this. 
Q: You think th is could happen ag ain? 
A: As long as 
Israel
 is strong, I don™t think so, but 
it™s gonna -- goes into realm of 
politics. So I think we™re becoming weak in 
Israel.
 Too m -- you see, you can™t 
even compare 
Israel
 of today an d 
Israel
 even 30 years ago. 
No, I don™t even know 
what to say. What to say, we just giving aw ay -- our tiny country  away. O-Of 

course we have to separate from the Arab
s, we have to separate somehow. But t -- 
empty land, we have to keep it. We have
 to keep it. When 
I look, let™s say at 
Golan 
Heights,
 it™s not only defense of the countr
y, we™re always emphasizing defense 
and defense and defense. It™s not 
that. Take a look. Who divided up 
Africa
, 
Middle 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
93
East?
 The Colonial powers. They divided up, 
they set up borders and they set up 
their rules, their interna
tional borders. Who gave them the right to separate 
[indecipherable]
 
Jordan
 from 
Israel --
 from -- or to separate 
Golan Heig hts
 from 
Israel
? Who gave them the rights? It™s wh
at I me -- question. Don™t forget, 
Golan 
Heights 
was a tribe of 
Manasseh
 once. And you have to 
look at the historical 
prospectus. You know, during Roma
n times, your first je -- war, 
Golan Heig hts
 
belonged to -- to Jewish state. Was it under 
Ag rippa
, or what his name was, 
[indecipherable]
 the second? I don™t rememb er 
the name of the king with the 
[indecipherable]
 but it was under Jewish rule. I 
remember this vividly. So  if 
French or English th ey decided to , for th
eir own purpose to put new borders, why -- 
I don™t go along with it. 
Q: What do you think th e role of educa
tion should be about the Holocaust to the 
next generation? So mething like the Ho loca
ust museum, for example? Do you think 

lessons can be learned from the Holocaust,
 or is it too large, too much to be 
grasped? 

A: You see, we have many deniers of 
Holocaust, right? I -- I don™t know, when  
people come and -- and look at the exp
onents, right? Exponents or exponents? I 
think it depends on the person what his f
eelings are, or he doesn™t want nothing 
happen to u -- anybody else. Or so me people 
cu -- come with a vi
cious heart. It -- it 

 
Interview with Michael Lin

94
can happen too. They look an
d look and say, ah good. Th
is what happened to them, 
fine. You can™t -- you can™t get into a he
art of a person. Sometimes they™re frank, 
you know, I -- I worked with
 bl-blue collar workers and 
I know how they smell, 
even in 
America
. So there™s nothing new th at the anti-Semitism exists. I don™t 
know what is the percentage
, but everybody whispers, ri
ght? And especially for me, 
I don™t look like Jewish, some
times they think that I am
 a German. So they are 
frank with me. And -- 
Q: And how do you answer them? 
A: It™s a big surprise to them. You see,I don™t use my fists any more because it 

would be a prison term. So I know how to 
behave, but you know, whatever was said 
about Jews over the centuries, it™s alive toda
y, in -- in their hearts, in  their minds. 
They don™t -- they will never change. 
Q: Do you feel another 
Holocaust could happen? 
A: Maybe not, maybe not like a Ho locaust, but you see, t-take 
Austria
. You see 
coming to power people like this 
Hey -- Haider
. See, that™s very simple. Good that 
Haider 
is a small politician in a small country
, right? Suppose somebody comes in 
United States
. It can™t happen? Ah
, anything can happen . 
Q: Do you feel safe here in the 
United Sta tes
? 

 
Interview with Michael Lin  
 
February 27, 2000 
 

 
 
95
A: Yes, I feel safe now because we have
 a good economic climate. Ec-Eco nomy  is 
good and everything is prosperous. You al
ways feel safe when there™s something 
like this. In 
Germany
 we didn™t have this situ
ation with the inflation and 
unemployment and all that, 
Hitler
 would never come to power, you know that. 
Now there -- if the situation 
comes back, huh? I remember 
the situation here when -
- about the loans to
 the farmers in 
Iowa
. Right, they began blaming th eir bankers, 
the Jewish bankers, right? No? So see,
 you can™t change. How you say, a -- a 
leopard can™t change its spots,
 right? So what can you say? 
Q: Do you speak openly
 about your wartime experiences to others? 
A: I-I would say I don™t talk about it. 
Q: Why not? 
A: Well, what to talk about it? You kno w, the locals, they wouldn™t understand 

what it means, you know? How you talk to
 them? They -- you -- why would I talk, 
it will be complaining like, I feel .  You can™
t teach nobody nothing.
 I know how they 
smell right away, ar-are you at least neutral toward Jews, or you friend of Jews, or 

you against us. It™s -- it™s in your heart,
 it™s not that you ca
n change by word s. I
