So, as you see, of course, it's a mapof  Europe.
 
And we're going tof ind the country of  
Lithuania, Nesse'shom e country.
 
Nesse Godin was born Nesse Galperin in1928 inSiauliau
, 
Lithuania, 
whereher parentsowned a sm all store and sold dairy products.
 
Siauliau was a 
vibrant Jewish com munity and hadalmost 10,000 Jewish residents.
 
 
T his isa picture of Nesse when she was a little girl.
 
Isn't she cute?
 
She's still cute.
 
W e'l l  s e e h e r  i n a m inut e .
 
 
Here's a picture of Nesse with herf am ily andNesse has a circle drawn about.
 
S he ' s  
theone to your extreme lef t, the young child.
 
 
Af ter the German Army in vaded Poland in1939, Nesse'sf am ily heard terrible stories 
f rom  relatives in Lodz, a very lar ge city in Poland
, 
that Jews are being horrib
ly m istreated by 
the Nazis and by German soldiers.
 
T heyf ound these rum orshard to believe.
 
 
By 1941,Germantroops invadedthe SovietUnion andoccupied the Baltic countries 
of  which Lithuania is one.
 
In Siauliau, Lithuania, Nesseand herfam ily were f orced to move into 
a ghetto.
 
T hey li ved inthat ghetto for quitea long tim e.
 
 
In 1944, asthe Soviet Arm y approachedf rom theeast, Nesse was deported to 
Stutthof concentration cam p, near Gdansk, Poland.
 
Nesse was transferred to several camps 
af te r Stu tth of 
and was forced to go on a Death March,af orcedm arch, in January
 
1945.
 
On the 
10th of  March, 1945, she was liberated along with wom en with her,by Soviet troops.
 
 
In 1950, after spending f ive years in adisplaced persons camp, a DP cam p in 
Ge rm an y, 
Ne sse  
em igrated to the UnitedStates.
 
 
Nesse's story is oneof the mosaic of experiences encounteredby Holocaust survi vors 
andtoday she will share that history with us.
 
 
Please joinm e in welcom ing Nesse Godin.

[Applause]
 
>> Patricia Heberer

Ric e :  
T hank you
 
for joining us today, Nesse.
 
It's always a pleasure tobe 
with you.
 
W e're a team.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T h at 's  r i gh t .
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
So, do you want tostart f irst telling me what lif e was like before 
W orldW ar II broke out in Lithuania?
 
C an  y
outell us a little bit aboutwhat your f am ily did, how 
old you were? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W ell, I tell you,Lithuania, Jewish people were invited to be there by oneof 
the kings because Lithuanian people mostly were f armers.
 
So started to invite Jewish people
.  
And Jewish people cam e.
 
And som e were already from  other areas and they hadfull rights to 
live there, go to school, beeducated.
 
Som y two brothers and m yself , we were educated in 
Lithuania.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
[Inaudible] 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Yeah.
 S
o it was a norm al life.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Just anormal lif e.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
But, I don't know if you want m e to continue.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Sure.
 
Of  co u rse.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W hen the Soviets tookover, they were chasing the Germ ans.
 

3 
 
>> 
Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
A lot of people don't know that the Soviets
 
--
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Already things were different.
 
T he very r ich peoplethathad big businesses 
were sent toother places.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
L i k e c am p s ,  r i gh t?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
No .
 
It
 
saved them .
 
It saved them because if  they wouldbe inSiauliau, 
Lithuania
,  
they would have m aybe have beenkilled.
 
Soall of those rich people were taken 
to
 
--
 
If orgotnow what the names are.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Siberia and placeslike this?
 
>> N e s
se Godin:
 
Ye s .
 
But us
 
--
 
sincem y m other had a tiny little store, dairy store, just, you 
know, m ilk, butter, cheese,and m yf ather worked inafactory for shoes.
 
So we were there.
 
B u t 
they putpeople to see over in those little stores to seehow m uch money
 
they make
. I
f  they are 
too rich,they sent them  again.
 
So that's how we were taken over slowl y.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And you weren't allowed to go to Hebrew schoolanym ore.
 
Is that 
r i gh t ?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W ell, thething is, there was a Hebrew school.
 
And m y brothers, m yself,we 
went to the Hebrew day school.
 
And I startedf rom  kindergarten.
 
But when the
 
--
 
they took 
over, I was already 13 years old.
 
So I couldn't go to Hebrew school anym ore.
 
W eh a d t o  l ear n  
Russian.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
A nd  l ea r n
 
Russian along
 
--
 
instead of Hebrew.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T h at's it.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
So at a certainpoint, though in1941,theGerm ans invaded 
Lithuania.
 
They invaded the Soviet Union ofwhich Lithuania was now a part.
 
Do you 
rem em ber that tim e?
 
>> N
esse Godin:
 
Yes, I do.
 
I tell you, the most important thing that Irem em ber is when m y 
m other said
 
--
 
shedid the sam e thing just before the Russians cam e but, again, she said we 
have to run into the basem entbecause it looks like the Nazis, the Germ ans, are going to take 
over.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And they m ight shell or shoot or som ething.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
So we went downstairs in the basement.
 
And nobody bothered us.
 
Because, 
you see, them ain Nazis, the m ilitary, the m ilitary, were chasing th
e Russians but the other 

group, they were already taking over our town.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
So they occupied
 
--
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
S o the f irst th in g
 
--
 
you want m e to continue?
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Absolutely.
 
You're on a roll.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T he
y had made us wear the Star of David onf rontandbackof our garm ents.
 
 
W hen I  wa s  bo r n ,  I  was  a b l on d  l i t t l e gi r l .
 
And m y grandm otheronmy father's side was 
blond.
 
Ourneighboralwa ys used to say tomy m other that I belong to them .
 
Because I'm  
blond
, s
o  
said you always said that [speaking Lithuanian] is yours, take her.
 
W ha t d o 
you 
expect, I should risk my life?
 
Didn't take me.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Didn't take you.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
No .
 
So they m adem ehide under abed.
 
T hey made m e do whatever.
 
Bu t  
w
hen the ghetto was created, was a special thing.
 
They came to each house, those Nazis
 
--
 
I 
c a ll t h em  Na zis .
 
I don't want to say Germ an because Germ any now is a norm al country.
 
T he  
Nazis, you know, came to every house and they took whatever they wanted.
 

4 
 
 W
hen they came to our house, we were in the kitchen, I remember,lined up,m y 
father, mother, two brothers andm e.
 
And a young Lithuanian girl was assigned
 
--
 s
he  k new 
G e r m an
 
--
 t
o give us adocum ent to go to theghetto.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
S o lik e  a  
ticketor a schein, in Germ an.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
You had this ticket.
 
So while the main Nazis
 
were taking what they wanted, 
c
hina, clothing, whatever, my m otherasked the young girl
 
--
 
she gave herm oney to 
ﬁ
write a 
c e rt if ic at e f o r m y girl.
ﬂ 
>> Patricia Hebe
re r
-
Ric e :
 
Because they were n't going to give you a ticket.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hey wouldn't give m e.
 
T hen when they walked out, my mother quickly 
looked if  the girl lef t usa certif icate.
 
Yes, there was two f or m y parents two f orm y brother, and 
one bl
ank certif icate.
 
See, the girl was sm art.
 
If they would catch her, she would say, oh,they 
just made out, you know
 
--
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Ablankone, an extra one.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Butm y parents couldf ill out the certif icate.
 
Andthat's how I walked into the 
ghetto.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
T hat was a lucky chance.
 
W hat happened topeople who didn'thave 
this ticket, that they weren't allowed?
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hey were takenoutand killed inthef orest near us.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
C a n w
e backtrackfor a second, Nesse?
 
Right bef ore you all went 
into the ghetto, there was som e shooting of about 1,000 men in thatarea.
 
Do you remember 
anything about that? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W ell, I'll be very sincere wit h you.
 
You know, I was so young.
 
M y f a t
her m ade 
behind the cabinet aplace where when they went to work, all of  them , I had to go into that 
hiding placeand stand there.
 
S o s om e t im e s  
--
 
what you can read now is the testimonyf rom 
other survi vors, m aybe they were older,m aybe they rem em ber, but I was standing there and 

theonly things I saw is those Nazis running and grabbing people away.
 
 
Oneday as I was standing there
, 
I saw one of our neighbors, a very nice lady.
 
S he  
had likef ive or six children.
 
Som eof  them  were working.
 
But one she was holding by herhand.
 
Dad wasn't around.
 
And all of a sudden I heard shooting.
 
T he Nazis shot thebaby in front of  
the m other.
 
I rem em ber af ter this day, 
W
hy didn't that Nazi take thebaby hom e? 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Righ t .
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W ould be Germ a
n.
 
B ut  t he y k ille d .
 
T hey did suchterrible things.
 
 
So m aybe, what you asked m e before
 
--
 
oh, I don't remem ber.
 
Oh, it happenedto 
som ebody else.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
I think,f rom going with you these past several years, that in thever y 
early weeks 
of  the war, when they were in Lithuania, the Germ ans were shooting justm en and 
boys.
 
And quickly over  the summer they began to shoot whole comm unities.
 
But they shot 
about 1,000 boys in Siauliau.
 
And you didn'tsee itor hear it.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Yes, beca
use they tookthem  to theforest.
 
In Lithuania there werem any 
f o re st s.  
And aroundSiauliauthere were parks andf orests and such.
 
Not just boys, it was 
som e rabbis and som e other people, and theboys.
 
W e heard shooting.
 
And what happened, 
they tookthem  r
ight to the forest and killed them .
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And killed them .
 
The groundm ovedfor several days af ter that, I 
rem em ber you telling m e.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
It's documented.
 
Som e think that document
 
--
 
some that were liberated, what 
they rem em be
r.
 

5 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And so can you rem em ber what it was like in the ghetto? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W hat was like in the ghetto?
 
W ell,as I tell you, when I was so young, I 
couldn't get a working job but whenthings becam e so terrible,m y mother paid somebody off.
 
You know, you couldalwa ys f ind somebody to give them a littlem oney, and to give m ea job to 
go outof  the ghettoevery day to go to work.
 
So they foundm ea job in a hospital where they 
usedtobring the German soldiers, the injured soldiers.
 
W hat was my job?
 
The young boys 
were chopping the wood.
 
T he girls, f rom  room  to room, sentfor things we didn't have.
 
An d  
that'show I was really helped a lot.
 
 
But oneday as we wer e com ingf rom work we heard criesf rom theghetto.
 
Are you 
going to askm e
 
th a t?
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Ho w d id
 
yo u
 
know that?
 
[Laughter]W hatdid you hear?
 
W hat  wa s  
happening inthe ghetto?
 
Because the children
 
--
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Every day as we cam e closer, the wom en that were crying, they told us 
what's happened thatday.
 
SS, Gestapo, and other peoplethat joined them  ran through the 
ghettoand grabbed everyone away.
 
W e didnot know then where they were taken to.
 
Am on g 
them  were healthy and strong and children and sick because, you see, the healthy and the 

strong the Nazis wanted to kill because they shouldn'tf ight them  back.
 
Among them was my 
fa the r.
 
T hey were taken.
 
W efound outaf ter the war thatthey were takento Auschwitz 
concentration cam p where they were killed in the gas cham ber.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And that was the child action in1943, that you lost yourf ather.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hatwas called the kinder
 
--
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
T hey alsotook grown
-
up people.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T h e s a m e.
 
But that was nam ed the kindertransport becausem ost people 
were child
re n
. T
hey took elder elderly, children,healthy and stronglike m y father.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
But yourf ather happened to be home that day.
 
And he was caught 
u p  in t h at  k illin g.
 
 
And you were in the ghetto for som e time.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W e were 
there a long time.
 
I didn't look carefully how long we were, but the 
thing was one day they said we are leaving gh etto.
 
Som e people were working in thef actory.
 
Some people
 
--
 
we had shoefactories, leatherf actories owned byJewish people.
 
T hey, 
them selve
s, had com e to the UnitedStates just before.
 
And one day they said, well, we are 
going to leave the ghetto, take your precious things with you and we're going.
 
T hey didn't say 
where we were going.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
T he RedArm y was  com ing.
 
>> N e s s
e Godin:
 
Because that's it.
 
You see, it was really
 
--
 
they wer e not af raidf orthe 
Ru ssia n s.  
T hey were af raidf or the Germans.
 
You know?
 
So the Germ ans f igured they have to 
m ove us out.
 
If not, the Russians will save us.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Righ t .
 
An
d they took you
 
--
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
In those days the Russians were the good ones.
 
You know?
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Indeed.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
And if  you can
 
--
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
T hings change.
 
But they were the good guys in thosedays.
 
Ye s .  
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
So they took usby horse and wagon to the train station.
 
And all of a sudden 
I'm  not with m y mother and I'm not with m y brother.
 
I'm there m yself .
 
I don't know where they 
are.
 
W e traveled.
 
W e cam e toa concentration camp called Stutth
of .
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Near Gdansk, Poland.
 

6 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hat was diff erent.
 
But at least there they didn't have a gas cham berand 
they didn't kill people there.
 
So thenight came, I lined up with the wom en.
 
W e had to line up 
a
nd leave everything
 
we took with us, just leave it behind.
 
 
T hen we lined up.
 
T hewom an said tom e, "Little girl, you cam eby yo urself?"
 
I sa id , 
" No .
 
I cam e with m y mother" .
 
On the side ofm e.
 
She said tom e, "They m ust have killedher 
already" .
 
 
You know
, i
t was terrible.
 
But she said, oh, you should
 
--
 
I hope you can get out of  
here to som e labor cam p or som ething because inthe concentration cam p they'll kill youfor 
sure.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And so did you getto one of those labor cam ps? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
W e ll, e ve
ry m orning we wer e lined up and they looked us over.
 
A nd  t he  
wom en always said tom eput yourself around with s
c a rf
 
so you lookstronger.
 
P u t s
c a rf  
lik e  
this on your head so you look
 
--
 
and if  you could get out to a labor cam p,m aybe you'll survive.
 
Here they won't donothing.
 
They said look at the lining of  people.
 
Pinch your cheeks so they 
wi ll be pink,health.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Stand on your tiptoes so you're taller. 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
And thenm aybe, maybe they wil l let you out.
 
 
So oneday as I'm
 
standing thereand that woman says, " Did you do what I told you?"
 
You know, put on this do that
a
nd standhere and hopefully you'll be ableand maybe you can 
sneak up on top of  that hill.
 
W ell, I tell you, som e people did it and I followed.
 
And I stood th
ere 
andI they lookedus over.
 
It turned out 1,000 wom en sent to other labor camps.
 
And f rom  
those labor camps I was sentf rom  place to place to place.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
And can you talk about any of those places?
 
Did you do hard work
, 
h
ard labor? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Yousee, we didn't talkbefore a littlebit soIf orgotbut you knew to askme.
 
T hat's why I had stopped.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
T e ll m e .
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hat's wh y I stoppeda littlebit. 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :

>> Nesse Godin:
 
I was in aboutf our orfive labor cam ps.
 
W hatdid we do?
 
W e were digging

See, a tank
 
--
 
the Germ ans wanted 
t o  k ill t h e t an k s .
 
Atank can goup thehill, down the hill, but if  itf alls like this, it goes in.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
I t 's st u ck.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T hey cannot getout.
 
And we were thepeople, they killed them and thenwe 
hadtodrag them  outand get ridof  it.
 
And that we didf rom  cam pto cam p to cam p.
 
 
And I tell you, in those days, you know, I still was ver y, ver y young.
 
I was not even16 
ye t .
 
Oneday they said, well, we are leaving the cam phere.
 
So we thought we are going to 
another.
 
But instead we started what they call the Death Marches.
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
Can you talk a 
little b it ab o ut tha t?
 
I thinkyou ended up in a barn.
 
>> Nesse Godin:

One tim e we were in a 
barn.
 
I didn't speaktoo m uch.
 
Allof  a suddenI hear noise

Th e

Sothey chased us outside.
 
Milk a cow gi ves the next day.

>> Nesse Godin:
 
Oneday, we stopped in a barn.
 
It was af ew days and we were notm oving.
 
W edidn't know what was 
happening.
 
And the guards were hiding.
 
W e didn't get any food.
 
People ate straw.
 
People did anything they could.
 
And they told som e women to take them  out, 
thedead,anddress them  naked because the clothing you can recycle.
 
 
W hen you go through the docum entaries in the Holocaustm useum ,you see this.
 
 
And, we didn't really know what was what, what's doing, who was leaving, who is not.
 
Oneday one of the wom en that carried out the deadbodies said " I didn't see the guards."
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
W
hat didthat mean? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
So, som ebody said, oh, they m ay be hiding behind the barn.
 
But you see, 
they ran away.
 
T hey knew the Soviets were taking over.
 
But we didn't.
 
So we sat inthat barn 
andall of a sudden we hearm arching.
 
W ethought the Na

And then we heard 
Russian language.
 
And lucky we knew a little bit of Russian.
 
>> Patricia Heberer

Ric e :
 
From that tim e when you were in class.
 
Right? 
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
T h at's it.
 
And they were saying we are chasing the Germans,they are 
lo sin g

So we didn'teven 
tru st the m.
 
W e were not so sure thatthat's what's happening.
 
Buttwo days later, doctors 
c a m e.
 
And in the village they m ade ahospital.
 
And they took us
 
all in tothat hospital.
 
 
And then Ididn't remem ber anything.
 
All of asudden I wake up in ahospital.
 
A nd  
wom en are saying,

ﬂ 
Ididn't realize that I was outof  consci

And

I'm sohappy you're alive.
 
W e ' l l

Don't worr y.
 
Don't worr y."  and they set us up andhelped usbut many, many 
of  useven died in those hospitals.
 
 
I don't know how I survived but I was already at thatpoint 17.
 
From13 to 17 I lived
 
through hell.
 
And we were all later set up in displaced persons cam p.

And they alwa ys said if you survive, don't 
let us be forgotten
; t
each the world what hatred can do.

Did you ever go back to Lithuania, backto your native villa ge?

W hen [Indiscernible] started tobuild thebuilding, 
Mr.

Ric e :
 
T he f ounder of this theater.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
Said to m e,W
hy don't you go back?
 
I said I don't have the m oney
; 
I  am  
workin g and doing all ofthat.
 
He said, 
W

I have f requent Flyer points
 
I ' ll give  yo u .
 
Go f ind 
som ebody that will go with you
, t
he young lady that also was volunteering at that tim e.
 
And we 
went to Auschwitz, wh ere m yf ather was killed.
 
W e went to many other killing places.
 
And we 
did go to Lithua
nia.
 
 
T he Jewish community there was very sm all.
 
Most peoplehad em igrated.
 
And when I 
askedthem  why they are still there, well, the intermarriage, the children, you know.
 
And they 
hada nice sausage there.
 
T hey m ade breakfast and drinks f or m e and m y par
tner.
 
 
And then Iheard Jewish songsf rom  theoutside.
 
I s a i d , 
ﬁO
h, whatare you doing?
 
A re  
they doing som ethingspecialfor Hanukkahfor the children?
ﬂ ﬁ
No,we don't have m oney.
ﬂ 
I 
said, ok, letm e see.
 
 
So when I cam e back,as well as I raisedm oney f or thebuilding, I cam eand I talked 
t o  Mr.
 
Myerhoff andhe said,don't worr y
, 
10 people, 20 people, everybody gi ve you
 
$5, you'll 
ge t it.
 

 
So I sent them  quite abit of m oney.
 
And even not so long ago they said that the 
Jewish area is not thatpopular but they still have m y picture
 
as
 
thesupporter of the Jewish

He llo .
 
T here you go.
 
You talked about being put on atrainf rom  the ghetto and being sent 
on a train.
 
W ehave a train upstairs in themuseum.
 
I wonder if  youcould talk about that 
experience a little bit. 
 
>> Patricia Heberer

Ric e :
 
Can you talk a little bit about what it was like tobeonthe train going

W e really didn't know where we were go ing.
 
W edidn't know of  Auschwitz.
 
W e d i dn ' t  k no w of  no t h in g.
 
So itturned out indocum entary that 
we  we r e

some later onthey sentthem  to work butm any, m any were killed right away.

Here we go.

Ye s .
 
M y question is
 
--
 
f rom  your experience, in your opinion, why would you think that your 
non
-
Jewish neighborsandfriendsturned against the Jewish com munity so quickl y that you 
see i
n the documentaries?
 
Did they just buy into the propaganda ordid they not truly take in 
the Jewish com munity?
 

>> Patricia Heberer
-
Ric e :
 
S o,  he 's a skin g
 
--
 
you were saying that you were in this very 
integrated community bef ore the war.
 
W hy isit that your neighbors turnedagainst you when 

12
 
 
the war started?
 
W as it propaganda?
 
W as itthat you were never fully accepted?
 
T he Jewish 
counterparts.
 
>> Nesse Godin:
 
I tellyou, I asked that question many tim es.
 
But people said, well, even now 
people don'tm ix in.
 
T he
y see all of these terrible things happening and we let it go.
 
 
So in those days I suppose they didthe same thing.
 
T hey wanted to protect 
them selves.
 
As I said,take your little girl
. 
13, 13
 
1/2  I wa s a t tha t time .
 
T he neighbors are 
going to say we saved a Jew.

It wa s

It's really nobody

I didn't see adocument saying exactly who did.
 
But there were 
people involved and created those places.
 
An d
 
we were held.
 
Because if  it wouldn't be Jewi sh 
relief , Christian relief, the Red Cross.
