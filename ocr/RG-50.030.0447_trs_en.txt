A: Was Rollig,R-O-L-L-I-G. 

Q: Would you say so me thin
g a bout your fa mil y bac kgr ound, your
, your f ather , fir st hi s na me  a nd 
then what he  di d?  

A: Fi ne .  M y  fat h er™ s  na me  wa
s Franz Xaver and shortl y aft er  I 
wa s born, Wo rld Wa r I broke out 
and he we nt into t he Ar my and my
 mother and I, we wer e al one. 
 My, then there 
was no mone y for  
soldi ers™ wi ves and s o on and my fa
mi ly wasn™t rich so Mot her had 
t o wor k.   An d s he went to work  
at a very unusual way.  Sh
e worked for, as an, i mporter for a fi
r m that reproduced wooden barrel s. 
And s he we nt all over t o buy th
e ri ght wood, I don™t know any 
more a n d I ne ver knew a nd neve r 
will know what kind of wo
od it was.  But she was very good at that and 
when my father came home  
in 1918, I was five year s  old.  I 
hardl y recognize d  hi m.  I tol d 
my mot her, ﬁThere™s a st range man 
out there, woul d you go look for hi
m?ﬂ Then I knew it was 
Fa ther.  Duri ng the war he occa sionall y  
came and br ought food
 because food was ver y, ve
ry rare in Vi enna.  I ha
ve ver y bad memories as  
far  as food goes t hat Mot her and 
I, we were standing i n li ne for a 
l ong ti me .  I™ ve , now, i f, I try to 
re me mb er,  it  see ms  it  wa s 
the whole  night i n orde r to get  s o me 
food rati on that , t hat  was s uppose d 
to come t o us and when we got 
there, was someti mes ther e was no fo
od left and sometimes, once a t  
least, I remember when we came
 home , ther e were pota t oe s and th
ey we re all spoil e d and M othe r  
cried.  So I wa s the n ma ybe t hree ye ars ol d.  Occ asi
onally, we  went to my gr
andparents.  They had a 
far m in, in Si lesia, no, in, in
 [ta l kover ] , no, Mor avi a  . . .  

Q: Mor a vi a.  

And my, my father™s pa rents had a 
far m i n M or avia .  My fa ther™s pare nt s, the y had t he far m in 
Mora via a nd Mot her a nd I went t here  seve ral ti me s 
in orde r to get s o me fo
od.  The y, t hey did n o t  
suffer  so mu ch because t h
ey had all kinds of ani mal s and, and, 
and, it™s, it, it 
was n™t too ba d for  
the m a nd when we ca me home , we always ha d f
ood for t he few we eks t o  eat, until t h at went l ow 

agai n a nd t h en we  went  bac k to 
them agai n.  They we
re ve ry good t o us and I ha ve  ver y vi vi d 
me morie s of my gr andmother , who c arried me on he
r bac k, no pera mbulat or or some thing like that . 

She j ust carr i ed me on her bac k.  So
 I must have bee n ver y lit tle and 
pr obably ver y light als o.   So  
when the war was over my fat her  
came home.  He was a mechani cal
 engi neer  and t her e was no j o b

for him to get so he 
worked as a ditch digger and in a factory 
as this and in a fa ctory as that until the 
situation had settled.   
Q: What wa s  your  mot her ™s na
me  and her fa mily background?  
A: My, my mother ™s na me  was  Anna Stei ner , and 
my gra ndfat her  ha d, well  fact or y is  sai d t oo 
much, he had a little
, what would you say . . .   
A: Shop. 

A: A little shop where he pr
oduced linen and I still ha
ve napkins fr om him.  
And one tabl
ecloth that 
he, he produce d, it™ s a long ti me . 
 And he lost  that 
a nd my gra nd mot her and t wo sisters  and a  
brot her  were  alone .  Grandfather die d.  And she . . .  

Q: He l ost  that beca use  of the  war?  

A: No , th at wa s be fore t he war.  Th ere, I do 
not  know whet her you a r e 
fami liar wit h European 
history but t here was a very, very har d ti me and 
peopl e like now, the y just  had to cl ose  up.  There  
wa s no more , aski ng for good suppli e
s and good things.  Pe opl e bought
 whatever t hey coul d and as  
long as it wasn™t too expensive a
nd a p pare ntly wha t  he produc e d wa s ver y expe nsi ve.  You ca n see  

if I have now still someth
ing that  he produc ed, it must have b
een good.  Now it™s 
more  than hundr e d 
years now almo st.  So, my mo th
er  and my fat her  mar ried in 
1909 and I was born in 1913. 
Q: Di d you have  any br
ot hers  or  si ster s?  
A: My mot h er had one st illbor n chil d.
  That, that was all, no more.  That was before me.  I was an 

onl y one .  He clai ms  you ca n sti ll 
see it.  But it doesn™t, __________. 
Q: Wh at were your pare
nts™ political leanings? 
A: My father  was a Soci
al  Democrat .  He 
wa s ver y  mu ch c onc e r ned wit h
 the wel f are of poor pe opl e  
and he trie d to hel p as much a s he c o uld.  He 
became a council ma n in t he c
ity council and he was ,  
he was kind of, well shunned, b
ecause wherever it was an
d whe r ever he we nt he would s ay, ﬁThat™s  
fi ne but , but  you ha ve t o do so
met hing for t hose people .ﬂ  For i nsta nc e he  or ga ni zed t hat , a t  
Chr i st ma s, basket s woul d go out wit h food to poor  fa mili es and of c our se , he wa sn™t loved for t hat  

by the people who had to f
ill the baskets.  And, I gue
ss I grew up in that spirit
.  I still love to send 
bas kets too but I send t he m, s o.  An
d my mother wa s very hel p ful in 
e ver ything that ha d to be done  
in this respect.  In fa ct
, my  father used to say,
 ﬁIf you want something fr
om Mot her , s he will  gi ve 
you her l ast  shirt .ﬂ  An
d it, it was true, so. 
Q: Di d you have  a parti cular reli gious  
upbringing, r eligious  e ducation, als o?  
A: Ye ah .  M y mot her wa s ver y re
ligi ous .  She wa s Catho
lic.  She was very reli
gious in the way that 
she thought you have to, you have a 
certai n a mount of obli g ation a nd you have to he lp where ver  
her, you ca n.  That wa s mostly he
r reli gion.  The rest of her famil
y, t here wa s one au
nt who we nt t o  
chur ch al mo st daily a nd my fa ther di dn™t thi nk ve ry 
much in religious terms. 
 He always said that 
religi on i s the crut ch of t he poor 
a nd the c hur ch t r ies to ke ep t he m i n bondage .  That  was hi s fe eling 

so as you ca n see my, for some ti me, I we nt to
 parochia l sc hool beca us e appa rentl y  it was the n  

already, al so better than the pub
lic schooling.  It was not too go
od a n e xperi enc e for me , and I  
droppe d out . 

Q: Wh at was your father
™s attitude toward Jews? 
A: I don™t know, he never had any. 
 For us, in our house, my  father
 had a fri end who wa s a  pri est . 
They came and they came 
toget her and they ar gued 
for hour s.  And my fat h
er used to say, ﬁAnd 
where wa s God when, on the, on th
e, in
 the war when the people were lying on the ground moaning 
and dying by the hundre
ds? Where was God then?ﬂ That™s
 what people ask now about the 
Hol oc aust , t oo, r i ght?   He had t he sa me a ttitude.  
We ha d, we had Jewish frien
ds.  I had a very, ve ry  
good J e wi sh fri e nd.  She di
ed l ast yea r  in Cali for ni a.  We , we kept very cl os e all the ti me .  Whet her  
some body was as he al ways said, 
ﬁ Whet her s o me body™ s gr een, bl ue 
or red, it doesn™t matter, as

long as they are good.ﬂ 
 And this was his attitude. 
 And for religious reason, 
he didn™t really, I don™t 
think he ha d any feeli n gs for or
 against a ny ki nd of r e ligi on.  He
 j ust  didn™t beli e ve int o the  
doctri ne s of t he r eligi ons. [ta lkover ] 
Q: Did you, do you re me mb
er from your c hildhood seei ng a ny type
 of a nti- Se miti s m or any t ype of 
discrimi nation? Were you 
aware of, of that in 
Vienna at t hat ti me? 
A: Dis cri mi nation, r eall y onl y a gai nst me.  M y 
fat her , we, I  was once de
taine d, wr ongl y in t he  
aft ernoon and my par ent s  were very
 c onc erne d tha t  I didn™t c o me ho
me , even the n you didn™t kno w  
what ha ppened.  I f your c h
ild is supposed to be home
 at one thirty, a nd at t h
ree or four o™clock, it™s  
not a t  home ,  you wonde r .  
So my fat her came t o sch
ool and I recall t hat t h e, 
the priest had ke pt me  
and a fe w ot her girls  in s chool for 
 a very funny i ncidenc
e.  He asked what  wa
s Christ  when he  was 
for 40 days in the, in th
e desert and ther e was no 
food a nd t hat wa s at  t his
 time, the time of the 
people who wer e call ed ﬁhunger arti s t sﬂ.  I don™t  t h
ink you know what that  
me ans here.  There were  
people who were going on 
a hunger stri ke for so 
a nd so long in orde r 
to, to show, to prove 
somet hing.  And when
, when the  pri est a ske d wh
at wa s Chr i st, one of t h
e girls  sai d , ﬁ A hunger  
artist.ﬂ  And then he said, ﬁWho sa
id that?ﬂ And of cour
se , nobody did sa y so 
I was one of the ones 
who wer e s u ppose d to ha ve s aid it  
and thr ee or four ot her s we re ther
e too.  And my 
father came and 
he tol d the priest t hat what he did was wr ong 
beca use he  can ke ep me at , i f he  thinks I di d 
somet hing wrong t he ne xt  
da y, a m I t o o wordy?  
Q: [negative grunt] 

A: That he can keep me t he next
 da y but not on the da
y when my pa rent s don™
t know about it.  And  
fr om t his da y on when t he prie st ca me i nto th
e class, every morni ng he
 said, ﬁ ____________ go 
into the corner.ﬂ  And then I had to stand all, all 
the whole hour until the hour
 was over.  So this was  
the discrimination I experienced.  We ll, then there,
 of course, the girls  or the boys  that we re not  
Cat holi c, the y c oul d sit i n  the  rea r  of t he clas
s but  I  di dn™t  find t hat t his  was  discri mi nati on. 
Q: When you, whe n you say 
not Cat h olic, were  t h ese Pr otest ants or , or  Je ws ? 
A: Pr ote stant and Je ws .  The y were , they c oul d sit  in
 the rear of the class and they coul d read or do  
anyt hing el s e.  I neve r fe lt that t his was di scri mi natio
n. [tal kover ]  I , no, no
t exactl y, but I know t h at 
three girl s I was cl os
e with, they were in
 my cla ss . . .  
Q: Three, t h ere wer e 
t hre e Je wi sh girl s. 
A: Thre e Je wis h girl s.  I  was prett y c l ose with, I 
visite d the m,  they vi site d me .  We pla yed t oget her  
and it  was , it  wa s, wel l  a very close re lationshi p. 
 So, of, of c our se, when 
the Nazis ca me, it changed  
drasti cally, t hen.  Everyt hing cha nge d and the y wer e resett le d.  I didn™t have a ny c ont act the n wi th  
the three gir l s.  I wa s, I  did 
go up beca use I went then t o sch
ool i n Vienna and I  wa sn™t i n  
As kers dor f a nd thi ngs ha d cha nge d quite a lot .  
And then when the Nazi s 
ca me, I tri ed to conta c t 
one of the gi rls but they already, t he fat her was a 
physicia n, t h ey alrea dy had le ft but they we re not  
resettled.  They had 
left for, I do not 
remember, America, 
anything, anywhere. 
Q: When, when di d yo
u move  to Vie
nna?  
A: I  lived i n  Vi enna al l t he ti me
 but it was a suburb an
d I went t hen, I  move d 
then into the city, 
proper, in the first  dis tric t.  Whe n
 was it? I think in ™37,
 ™36 or ™37.  I worked there.  My father 
wa sn™t very happy t hat I move d ther
e but I, living in the suburb as it 
is here , in order t o go fr om the  
Wh ite House to Silver
 Spring or t o e ven Belts vill e(ph) , i t  ta
kes you an hour and 
a hal f because we  
didn™t have cars at t his  ti me .  You us ed public tr
a nsportati on a nd i t  wor ke d
 out  well .  I had a good 
job.  I, I li ke d my j ob 
and, and I me t my  husband. 

Q: Go bac k j ust a bi t.  In ™34 ,
 as I understa nd it , Dol fus ha d ba nne d all poli tical par ties i ncluding th e  
Socialist s.  What  effect did that  
have  on your fa ther, on
 your  fa mi l y li fe and on your  pe rcepti on?

A: I don™t t h ink it  ha d ve ry much 
effe ct.  My father did 
anyhow what he wante d
 to do.  He  al wa ys  
did.  Like al most all me n do, ri
ght?  And, well , Dol f us , he had apart y of peopl e and he ha d man y  
people around him who were 
t hought kind of ridi cul ous  
people, die Hamenschwenzler? 
A: Yah.  The y, the y ri dic ulous. 
A: Hmmm?  

A:   T hey  we re ri dicu
l ous _________ Pol and. 

A: Yeah, t h ey, they wer e, 
they wore hats with a, 
a cock feat her on their  hats or t hey wer e cal l ed 
accor ding to the cock feat her and wer e  made
 ri dicul ous, t his is about all  I  know. 
Q: But he wasn™t pe
rsecuted any way. 
A: No, no, no, n
o.  He was not per se cute d.  What ever he di
d, he got a wa y  with 
it.  He  was , e ven  
when I was arrested when
 he went, no, no, out. 
Q: We  ca n  get i nto t hat . . .  

A: Yeah. 

Q: That time later.  

A: Ri gh t.  

Q: Did you have any knowledge of the, did, did you have much po
litical awareness, what was goin g 
on in Ger ma ny?  

A: No.  No, no, I  di d, unfort unate
ly I di dn™t  ha ve ver y muc h  poli ti
cal  awareness.  See I went t o 
school a nd I worke d and it really 
t ook up all my ti me .  And my mot h
er was sicki sh and I also t ook 
care of her.  So whatever 
time there was, 
I didn™t have time fo
r politics.  I was inte
rested in it, but I 
could never take an active 
part.  I took an active part in politics
 only after Hitler came  to Vienna . 
The n I start ed to be come muc h 
mor e aware of what was going 
on and I, because ma ny of my  
fri ends were affecte d by it .  An
d, and I, I tried to fight it. 
Q: Tell me about what you were 
st udyi ng in sc hool [tal kover ] an
d what you were doi ng for wor k  
aft er? 

A: Oh I worked, fi rst of all I, I 
went  t o t he I nstit ut e, Le hrer bildung
sanstalt, I don™t know now . . .  
A: Te acher college. 

A: It™ s a teacher™ s col lege, okay, 
and while I, in my free time, I worked in the Je wish kindergarten 
whi ch I e nj oye d i m me nsely.  I , I  ne ver kne w that 
I woul d l ove  chil dre n  that  muc h but i t  was  a  

delight ful j o b.  I eve n t h ought so
me t i me  that I  woul d write  a bout 
the sayings of the children and 
their be havi or.  I ne ver did of cours e, t hat was 
j ust a dream.   And t hen
 aft er I  ha d my degr ee I  
started, I tried to start to
 work in a public kinder
ga rten but  it  was a bs olut ely i mpossi ble  beca use  as  I  
applied fo r the job, the inte
rviewer told me, ﬁWell, I 
tell you, we do ta ke t w o people a year.  We hi re  
two people a  year .  We have hundr
ed and three applicati ons so you 
fi gure out how long it will take 
befor e you are being hired.ﬂ  So 
my, my aspects of being a bei ng a 
publi c kinder gart en t eacher went  
all the way down.  Then I ju
st tried to get all kinds of
 jobs and it was ™33, th
e time when it was very,  
very hard to get jobs.  It was in
 Amer ica the same.  There was t he bi
g cr ash on the , on the Bör se, on 
the st ock market a nd i n  Eur ope it wa s the s a me.  Jo
bs wer e very scar c e.  So fina ll y I did get , I 
worked as a secret ary in 
a, i n a  fac t or y, no, no, i n
 an offi ce t h at i mported 
wo od  fr o m Yu go sla v ia.  
Then I worked for so me times in an offi ce that 
i m porte d fr om Ger ma n y, dr yers , comme r cial dr yers 
and what els e did I do?   And t hen 
I, one of my father™ s ac quainta n
ce s los t  his wi fe and he  ne ede d  
some body to take care of 
his books a n d help hi m i n hi
s praxis.  I took that  job and this is when I met 
hi m while I wa s there and I, I stayed
 i n t his job unt il I wa s arres t ed. 
Q: Let™s go back t o your worki ng wit h chil dre n. 
 You wer e
 worki ng wit h, 
in t his  kinderga rte n  
i mme diat ely aft er you got  out of s chool? 

A: No, no, no, while I wa
s studying.   I was working two or 
t hre e [tal kover ]  t hree  da ys , ya h.

Q: As an intern. 
A: Studyi ng to be a t eac her in Vie nna  is quit e di ffe
rent .  I do not know whether thi s li ke that her e  
but I reme mber that we had to work
 for three months in an institute
 for the blind.  
Three months in 
an institute for the deaf
1
 and three months we worked in an ins
titute or institution for the retarded. 
And I remember that this was the hardest part  of 
my st udying, so.  And wh
atever  I had on fr ee ti me,  
I wor ked in t he kinder gar ten, partly as  part  of
 my  training, partly al
so because I liked it. 
Q: What did you li ke about it?  You sa id yo
u wer e surprise d by ho
w much you liked it. 
A: Yes .  

Q: Wh at wa s th
at  experience? 
A: We ll, I al wa ys li ke d c hildre n but I  never kne w how much you c an 
do to help them grow up and 
to help them to develop their abilitie
s to see the world, to learn how to
 talk.  I reme mber that I tried 
to teach them Englis
h, English songs a
nd one of the fi rst one was pitte
r patter pit pat, listen to the  
rain.  You know that? N
o, you don™t  know an E
ngl ish chil dre n™ s s ong?  
Q: You wa nt to sing it? 

A: No , it wa s, pitt er 
patter pit pat, listen to the rain, falling 
in t he ga rde n, r unning down the pane.  A 
big s ong and the , another one t hat we , that I tr
ied to teach them was th
e tee nsy weensy spide r  
[talkover] you know that, went up
 the water spout.  And those ve
ry tiny little things and the kids 
were just delightful.  I remember
 that once we went ou
t to the park and one 
of the little boys says, 
ﬁWill you please excuse me but the fi
re engine has to make
 pee-pee.ﬂ [t alkover] 
 So those, all those 
things made me to get so much 
cl ose r  to the c hildr en, t o unders tand t he m so mu ch mor e.  You le a r n  
a lot from books but you do not lear
n what you can lear n from a pers
onal contact.  Their warmth, 
their love and later on I often thou
ght how many ma de it. 
 That was the hard part because I am sur e  
that ma ny of them and 
their parents perished. 
Q: And this, these , t his  ki nder gart en was a  Je wi sh kinder gart en s peci fi cally?  

A: Yes , it wa s, it was run b y a J e wis h or ga ni
zation but I do not rememb
er anymore by what 
orga niza tion. 
Q: How did you end up in
 a  Je wi sh ki nder gart e n?  
A: This was arranged from, this, 
fr om the college.  The college se nt
 people out to t his , and t o thi s,  
and to thi s ki nder gart en a nd I happe ne d t o get t his
 one .  __________ sit, yo
u™ll fall down. [talkover] 
Q: Did you have, you mentione d 
tha t  you ha d, you had ma ny Je wi
s h fri ends and that you ha d 
Je wish frie nds i n your fa mil y a n
d your fa ther had Jewish
 acquaintances and ye
t there, there was a 
growi ng per haps se ns e of a nti- Se mi tis m es peci a lly 
after Hitler came in.  
Di d you, di d you ha ve  
fri e nds who wer e n™t Je wi sh, who wer e , who were
 que stioning your tea chi ng J e wish c hildre n a nd 
enjoying t he m s o much or di d you 
e xperi enc e a n y sort of der i sive 
comments for doi
ng that sort of

 It wa s more , we wer e young

 What was. . .  
A: A t eacher ™s college.  The Vienna
 teacher ™s college.  An
d li ke  most of t he colle ges , no I shoul dn™ t  
say most.  But in all the colleges 
there  was a l arge perce nta ge of Je

mo re Jewish than anywhere
 el se  be ca use  Vienna  had t he  lar ge Je wish popul ation. 
Q: Now . . .  

A: I , I  als o wo rke d wit h  Je ws  a l ot.   It, s o me ho w,  
I, I  ca n™t t ell  you how i t  
happened but my feelings 
were kind of, well, not biased in any way.  A pe

 it.  That™s what my 
fat her™ s t eaching was. 

Q: Di d you c onsi der  your sel f

Q: When the  Ger ma ns were . . .

 it was just unbelie vabl e .  Just t hinking of it, I  
cringe. 

Q: Would you descr i be  your
 meeting with, ho
w you met Dr. Pe rl and that day? 
A: I do not know exactly the date
 but it was s o meti mes i n J une , [tal kover], ™ 37.  And I ha d a bi g 
argume nt wi th my father
, as I told you he was n™t happy t hat
 I move d out of th

into the city proper and I was sittin

there was a l arge row of chair s a

were  chai ned one to a not her so  
that nobody could take on

, he walked by 
sever a l ti me s.  And I don™t re me mb
e r  that but he  says so.  And fi
nally he  aske d me, ﬁ I s this c hair  
here free?ﬂ The chair next to me
.  And I just spit  at
 him something like, ﬁO

hun dreds of chairs, leave me alone.ﬂ 
[ta l kover ]  So of course he sat 
next t o me a nd t h en we talke d 
and he start e d talki ng a nd he starte d te lling me a nd 
then we found out that I

Q: Wh at wer e  y our  firs

A: A ve ry br ash young man.
  But he wa s very likable

A: So the n we , we we nt  out a couple  of ti mes t oge
ther and then we thought well, this is something  
that will go into 
some thi ng more , more earnest  and I wa nte
d, well t he n  he  sai d, 
told me that he 
would neve r  marr y a  Je wis h girl , 
a  non J ewish girl a nd whe ther I 
would consi der converti ng.  And 
somehow I fel t  that converting wa
s absolutely not necessary for 
me be c a use my fe e lings wer e  
anyhow for, agai nst Nazi sm and fo
r e veryt hing t h at stood i n J ewi sh
 life.  But we 
br oke up anyhow, 
so, be ca use he didn™t want t o put  a ny kind of 
pres sure  on me  
and we parte d.  And then ca me  
Christmas and he send me 
a lilac bush, a white lilac bush as a Chri
stmas gift.  It™s, 
in a, it was for  
long time in the garden of
 a cousin of mi ne in, in 
Vienna.  I don™t know whet
her it™s still 
ther e.  He  
died and s o on and a 
fr ie nd of mi ne when she sa
w t hat bush she said, ﬁEh!
 That  mea ns mar r iag e . ﬂ  
And I t old her, ﬁ Y ou™r e c razy, we j u
st  broke up.ﬂ  She  was ri ght.  So
 we  got  the, I, I  calle d hi m and I  
thanked him and we got in
 touc h agai n and t hen t h
e, our, t he r elations hip 
became much closer and 
we decided we would marry.  I 
would convert and we
 would marry.  An
d then Hitler came. 
Q: Were you aware of wh at it would 
me an for  you, any pers onal da nger s?  
A: I  was  a w are.  I wa s very  mu ch
 awar e.  And especiall y my fat h
er was a ware of it .  He was, I 
think, much more aware because he
 was politically mu
ch more astute than 
I was.  And after we 
wer e  marrie d, it wa s ve ry ki nd of s a d a f fa ir.  My 
fat her , his brother , I  and he .  I t hink, I don™t  
reme mb er anymore who walked firs
t.  We went to the, to the 
Seitenstädter Temp
le where Rabbi  
[ta l kover ]  Ta geslic ht  ha d agree d t o ma rry us . 

Q: You were  converted?  

A: I had c onverte d, yea h.  But t here wa s no mi kvah
 a ny mor e so t he conversi on wa s not c o mpl e t e  
but i t , I  wa s converte d as far a s
 Tageslic ht we nt a nd he, he t o
ok into consid
eration all the  
circumstances. 

Q: Wh at did you have
 t o do to convert ? 
A: I, first of all I had to stud
y and I had to tell him 
a lot about Judaism.  
I tol d hi m my thought s 
about J uda is m a nd so on and appa
rently, whatever  we t alked and 
whate ver I had lear ne d about , he,  
he was satisfied when he questi
oned me.  And t hen, 
when we  got marr ied it  was a  ver y s hort  
ceremony and we all, I gues
s , li ste ne d, whet her t he SS is  c o mi ng. 
 And after, afterw
ards, we just all 
left t he way we  ca me , one behi nd the  other  a nd he  we
nt home  a nd I, I 
don™t t hink I  went
 wit h you.   
A: No. 

A: I onl y la t er ca me  t o you. 

A: Yah. 

A: And, well it was,
 as I said it was a sad affa
ir instead of 
a ha ppy one. 
A: Was illegal fr om both points, fr om the Jewish 
point of view and 
fro m the . . .  
A: Nazi point of view. 

A: Na zi poi nt of vie w .  From the  Je wis h poi nt of
 vie w bec ause s he had no
t really fully co mpleted  
the conversion.  She ha
d completed it according 
to his saying but she ha
d not fulfilled all the  
requi re me nt.  She  hadn™t studi ed 
enough and t h
ere  wa s no
 mi kvah, but Ra bbi Ta ge slicht  wa s a  goo d  
friend of mi ne from, I wa s ____
______ a nd he  kne w he r a nd he felt that she™ s a very val ua ble  

pers on a s he told me .  And he sa
i d, ﬁI f she converts , we ll you ca nnot 
wi sh for better Jewi sh chi l dren 
than fr om he r.ﬂ  He wa s c onc erne d.  So he sa ys 
__________ and fr om
 the Nazi poi nt of vie w it was  

a major, very major crime. 

A: We both would have been killed 
if they would have fo und out so 
it was, as I said it was a rather  
sad affair. 

A: He would have 
been killed too. 
A: And probably he to
o.  But killing for 
them was a very eas
y thing so . . .

A: The synagogue was in this 
building.  The Jewish 
synagogue still is 
in this building. 
A: But it™ s a  ne w bui ldi n g now.  We l l , a nd the n, we  ne

He was i n hi s apart ment and

th
 of April.  
And on the 10
th
 of J une  he  le ft  
for, after he had been arr ested
, and fr eed, he l e ft for Engla nd. 
Q: Di d you conside r  yoursel f, were you a ble t o 
c onsi der your sel f Je wi sh
?  Di d you fe el that you 
wer e able to really bec o me Je wi sh or did you fe el
 that that wa s just a si de conse que nce of your  
mar r iag e ?  

A: I  di d not fe el t he c onversion ha
d made me  more  Je wis h i n t h inki
ng and acting than I wa s before. 
That™s the answer to your questi
on.  After Bill had left
, I did collect food fo r the people who were 
sent t o the East a nd I ver y oft e
n work ed fo r Gilde r mei s ter .  Do you  k no w  wh o Gil der mei s ter wa s?  
And I do rec all one woman a nd a, her  
son and until today, I someti mes 
talk about it that I couldn™t, I 
do not know whet her the y got out be caus e I was 
arreste d be fore I coul d know whether they di d 
really succ ee d in getti ng out .  And until toda y I th
i nk of the littl e boy who was deli ght ful and he had 
a char ming mother .  And I 
some times wo nder if I wo uld have said
 t hat  I adopt t hat  child.  Nobody  
kne w t hat I wa s Je wis h.  If I woul d have a dopte d th
at c hild ma ybe I c ould have made s ure that he™ s  
alive. 

A: You will never have a
dopted a  Je wish chil d.  
A: At  this time  . . .  

A: No. 

A: Maybe  it  woul dn™ t have bee n possibl e, I don™t 
know.  But I feel, for on
e re ason or a not her  I  
always feel guilty that
 I let those two down. 
Q: Will you try to describe
 or reconstruct 
your growing politic
al awareness? 
A: It  started to become
 more political, not only feelings after 
I had met Bill.
  He told 
me about the  
plight of the people in Pola nd a nd he told me  
about Pale stine .  And that wa s, Pale stine wa s  
something that was not in my thinking at all.  It
 wa s too far a wa y.  But thr ough hi m I be c a me aware  
of so ma ny t hings and I r ecall the fi
rst time when he told
 me t ha t  he ha d coll ected s o me betteri m(ph)  
fr om Poland and they would 
go illegally to Israel and 
he showed me and introd
uced me to them.  It  
wa s al wa ys very cla nde s tine.  It al wa ys had t o be ve
ry secr etly so that I woul
dn™t be caught with any 
one of t he m.  And the n he asked me  whet her I wo
uld c onsi der kee pi ng his, we were  not marrie d  
then, ke epi n g his , the pas sport s of the people .  A
nd I re me mber that I ke pt al l the 16 pas s ports a nd I  

wa s a ver y, very big s ecr et age nt.  I put the m i nto 
a leather chair here in t he rear and I thought that  
would be a b solut e ly s a fe .  But fo
rtunately nobody looked
 for the m a nd nobody ca
me and aske d so it  
wa s sa fe .  That was t he fir st ti me 
when I really was involved in sa
vi ng some people ™s live s.  I, I  
kne w about it but  I, I only knew
 intellectually but no
w I had met  the  people and i t  wa s quite  
different.  And from then on as 
I was aware of his and 
became more and more 
aware of his activities  
I, I  was , l et™s  sa y c aught .

Q: It  sounds like you a nd 
Dr . Perl wer e  in ma ny ways ver y, ver y
 di ffere nt.  He ha d a di ffer ent leve l  
of political awareness 
than you certainly. 
A: Yes .  
Q: Wh at wa s the bond or 
the attraction? Can you, do
 you t hink you c an de sc ribe or  chara cterize  it?  
A: I think that I was, I was draw
n to hi m.  As I told
 you before it wa s his 
spirit and it was his 
me ntalit y that dre w me t o hi m a nd t h en whe n I re
alized t hat he was goin
g out , out of his way a nd  
forgetting about himsel
f and helping other people 
even to the, to the mayb
e end that he™s would be  
killed, it, it formed a bond. 
 And if I think about it 
now, it might also be th
at it reminded me of my  
father.  I never thought about it, it ju
s t  occurr ed to me now.  So you 
are now my therapist.  But it, it  
mi ght  be  tha t  bec ause my fat her  was  al ways s o 
c onc erne d wit h the underd
og t hat  thi s  wa s a not her  
attracti on. 

Q: How did your fa ther  feel a bout 
Dr . Pe rl?  Di d, what was . . .  
A: He didn™t  ha ve ver y ma ny feel
i n gs e xc ept that he  sa id, ﬁ You™l
l get into proble
ms  and you, you 
don™t know what you are  h
eadi ng for.ﬂ  But he would 
never sa y don™t do it  or don™t do that, never.  
He just said, ﬁHe will
 be working and he w
ill have to work and at ti mes he
 will have to
 forget about 
you and wherever you will be
.  If you are together, 
you will be an 
albatross about hi
s neck and if 
you ar e not  t oget her , you will  ha

 and wor ry.ﬂ   And th
is is how it was. 
Q: Di d your  fri ends know of the  marr i age?  

A: Nobody except my  father, 
hi s brot her and t he t wo of us. 
A: Nobody ________
__ t he whol e ti me. 

A: So.  People did __________ sus p ect.  People 
did suspe ct my cl ose nes sbe cause I always  ke pt

didn™t go a nd see  a nybody.  It
 wa s seven years, right?  So. 
Q: Wh en Dr. Pe rl we nt to London, wh en
 he  le ft  Vi enna

A: Yes .  

Q: Soon after you we

A: Married. 
Q: Wa s there a possibility of, of 
you going? Di
d you want to go,
 just the idea of escaping, gettin g 
out  of Aust ri a?  
A: I c oul d have pr oba bly gone  be caus e
 I could travel very freely but it,
 at this time 
it  was for many 
reason not possi ble .  My mother  was 
very si ck and I , I  just
 didn™t wa nt t o a bando

my father al wa ys pointe d out agai n a nd a gain, ﬁ Y ou™

will have so much to
 do, so much to wo

nd the safety of the 
people whom he tries to, 
to get into Palestine.  
I f you woul d go, it woul d 
not  be a good t hing.ﬂ  I  
realized t hat and I di
dn™t go.  And t he n whe n B
ill was in America 
he s ent a n a f fi da vit for my pare nts  
and for me but the war had broken 
out  and it was not, a nd my mother 
had died a nd ver y shortly a ft e r  
my mother  died, my fat her die d. 
 Fortunatel y i
n  a way because then
 when I  was arr ested I didn™ t 
have t o worr y a bout anybody but  my

Q: Mea nin g Dr . Perl .  

A: Ri ght.  And my fa
ther  and my mot her 
didn™t live anymore so
 I was on my own. 
Q: Soon in, after the war broke 
out  were you a war e __________ be
ing as they said in quotes 
resettled in the East.  Did 
you have any idea 
what that meant 
to be resettled? 
A: No, I did not know in the beginn
ing but after I saw that they took
 sick and old people to resettle , 
I a m a ver y gulli ble person.  I ho

station.  So I believed first th
at it is resettleme nt but when 
I saw the misery, the illness and 
everything I knew that, because 
Hitler at this time had already 
ordered the, the killing of the 
me ntall y ill  i n Vie nna .  So I kne w t hat  this  was  no
t  resett le me nt .  I  mea n kne w
 i n quotati on ma rk.  I, 
I, I felt that it wa
s not resettlement.   
Q: You were aware of the k
illing of the 
mentally ill? 
A: Yes.   I  wa s a wa r e o f  this  
beca us e I had a  fri end 
wh o wa s a nu rse  in th

me ntall y dist urbe d me n but I , a nd, she  ha d t old 
me  that they came in and took the incurable out . 
Q: And she knew wh
at  t his meant? 
A: Yes.  There was al so one sp
ecial institution, Steinhof, the, 
the Ya rd of, of St ones, literary 
translation.  There were only incu
rable me ntally ill and this, within
 a short time , it was completely  
e mptie d a nd you kne w  that.  I t hi nk al l Vienna  kne w i t. 

Q: Whe n you use d t o go
 and bring packa ges , food
 packages t o t he r esettl
ement center, were you, 
wer e you, was t hat a ri sky t hing 
to do? Were a lot of 
people  doi ng that?  We
re you under suspect?  
A: I do not know whet her  a lot of 
people do it .  I do not know whether I wa s a sus pect a nd I tell you  

I didn™t c are .  I just we nt there and I  brought it 
a nd tha t  wa s it. There are  ti mes when you rea lly  
don™t, I hope  you ne ver will be i n a situati on like th
at, when you do not rea
lly care what happens t o  
you, you j us t do what  you thi nk y
ou have to do.  And t his  is , I 
kne w I could not  hel p  ever ybody 

there, that there is, but I knew I 
coul d gi ve one or the othe r peopl e 
hope .  That was , t hat was  all I  

coul d do.  I, I, if I woul d have bee n  able to 
bri n g wa gons full of food 
it mi ght have helped one  
segment of settlement but wi
th my little things that I 
brought, it, 
it, it was just a littl
e bit of hope an d 
maybe also not on
ly hope but seeing that so
mebody cares that helped a 
little bit.  Th
at was all. 
Q: Can we go back to

 period immediately after . . .  
A: Yes .  

Q: And you had that sh

A: I kne w t h en be cause a s I told you I had ver y
 many J e wis h friends and 
ri ght a ft er the Ansc hlus s  
when t he SS started r ounding up J e ws, tha t  wa s for 
me, let™ s say a very hard a wa keni ng.  I kne w 
about anti-Semitism and I kn ew wh at it meant but I di
dn™t realize that it would 
go to that extreme. 
That , for  ins t ance , I  had ma ny frie

t he  bat ht ub.  Anot her  one j u mpe d  
off the wi ndow from t h

A: No, I wa s  not  ac quaint ed wit h 
a nybody who wa s, who was r eal a n 
anti-Semite.  I, 
if I tried very 
hard to reme mb er, no, no.  So me 
people were saying, oh well, th
e  Je ws , t h e, t he wome n fla unt ed  
their jewels, their jewelry and so 
on and pe opl e got ver y j eal ous  an
d, but  I don™ t t hink they were  
aware t hat  those were ant i - Semiti c fe
el ings  or  a nti- Se
mitic statements. 
Q: So do you think that  the ma jority of the Vi e
nnese pe ople  were per haps, apat hetic  towar d . . .  
A: Yes, yes.  But, but when it then
 came to looting, I should
 say it, it™s ugly to 
say but I fe el that the  
Au strians are very, very big opport
unists.  Ev ery single one of th
em and when it came to looting 
then, t he J e wis h home s and t he Je wi sh st ore s, t he y we
re all for it.  All .  I 
had a cousi n who™s , onc e, 
wh en  th e Nu re mbu r g  La ws  ca me  out
 and when the laws ca

 non Jews  shouldn™t

 And we nt to her store

this Jewish, this Christian swine

__________.  She  sat  
for  the  whole day t here  in t he wi ndow. 
 That™s, ma ny peop

people  di dn™ t ha ve  the  c o urage t o do i t . 
Q: When, when t he Nur e mbur g rac e  laws wer e impo

how di d that ma ke you

A: Well , I kne w about it  fr om t he be ginning.  For  
me it was n™ t  anyt hing new a nd I wa sn™t going to  
mar r y a  Je w any more .  Right?  So it  really di dn™ t 
affect me.  But I know, 
I know for instance an 
acquaint ance of mi ne went to, t o 
the prison where I was also because
 he had a Jewish gi rlfri end and  
I, I visited him in the 
pris on not knowing that  a  
s h ort ti me  la ter  I woul d be i n t here  too.  So. 
Q: So you, did you, woul

 you, when you were married that 
there was a sad feeli ng . . .  

A: Yes .

A: Three Nazis came towar ds us an

when those three came they
 mimicked our Je

so tall that Bill had to

 fear , what will

didn™t do anythi ng.  Th

[ta l kover ]  
A: No w the first, he c a me , fir st 
of all I had s muggle d mone y out to 
cousins of his which I gave the m  
in, i n Fume and t he n I went to his hot el.  I , I thi
nk he was n™t e v en there a nd 
when he ret u rned and he  
found me he  was quite happy.  An
d t hen we went  out a nd we ca me
 into a demonstration that was 
very, ver y sc ary for  me.  The , t h
e people were shouting Hitler, Du ce 
of, Hitler and, and Mussolini. 
A: __________ 

A: Yah.  And Hitler and th
e Duce should go down. 
A: The Duce. 

A: The Duce, the Mussolini, they 
should go down [talkover ] and, a
nd he brought, no pull ed me i nto  
a doorway and 
we there we were sta
nding.  I, you cannot imagine th
e, though the st
reet was filled 
wit h pe opl e, one ne xt to the othe
r , it was reall y a horri ble feeli ng.
  And a ft er the whol e  thing was  
cal med down, we we nt i nto t he ho
tel  and we, we  tried t o for get 
what ha d be en a nd what we ha d  
bee n through and we jus t  were happy to be togeth
er.  And the n we we nt out for di nner  and it must  
have been a l ong dinner because
 I do not recall  how long it t ook
.  We t ook ho
me a carri age. 
A: I  ha d bee n dri nking.  I, that™s  
one of the t hree  t i me s I ha ve bee n

but  I wa s high a nd s he al wa ys  tells  me how i n t h

 the top of my  voice. 
A: Yes , he wa s reall y si ngi ng at

it wa s alr eady ver y la te, s o, t his, this was our  
honeymoon.  And the next
 da y I  had to lea ve. 
Q: Di d you, i t  so
unds  as  i f you both 
ma y have had really a feeling of
, of hopefulness 
for  t h e fut ure .  
A: I tell you, I always 
thought if Willie promised 
me to get the moon
, he will get it. 
 And well, so.  
Q: It™s okay. 
A: At this time I knew that he 
woul d not sta y in Europe , that  he
 would go to Ame r ic a and he wil l  
ma ke it .  I, I  had so, I ca n™t tal k, c an™ t talk.  
Ther e mi ght ha ve bee n dangerous ti me s, I kne w t hat  
also but I knew that  he 
would make it.  I knew it.  As I always told when I came home, when the 
war was over and I came 
home from concentration 
camp, I always told ev
erybody Willie will be  
here i n Ma y.  Well he  wa s, he was her e on t he 22
nd
 of June .  So ever y, e ver y soot hsa yer c a n ma ke a ,  
a three week error, ri ght?  That™s 
it a nd he wa s there.  So I , I rea
lly kne w whate ver wil l  ha ppe n it  
will end well.  And I 
think he is an eternal optimist, he, anyhow, for him th
ere™s nothing that can be 
bad.  Ever yt hing will  tur n
 out  well and it  di d.  So. 
Q: Back in Vienna, it wa

That , that was the __________ side
 of the war breaking out.  No

that America would get into the

they did not tell me too 
much.  I kne w that wh

A: __________. 

A: And no i t  was n™t als o infor ma

The n I , I wa s arr este d.  My arrest  ca me  a bout, I 
had a ver y good frie nd a

 We ll one  da y s he  
came t o me and she tol d me, ﬁWe ha

And the rese ttle ment poi nt was th

very down a nd I want ed to go on

recuperat e.  And i n orde r to not  
ma ke it obvious  that , t h
at she is alone i n  th

cousin of mi ne to stay 
in the apartment with her.
  So when li ght is on, 
the water is running, that  
people do not say hey, wh o™s ther
e, this apartment isn™
t empty, she isn™t ther

gone, s he di d some thi ng very st upi d.  She we nt t o
 her la wyer .  And when she ca me t o  her la wye r , 
the Gestapo was there 
be caus e he had a Jewi sh wi fe .  So wh

d I do not know what they di

t hat s he had bee n hi di n g

 ba ck.  And when I c a me  
ba ck, s h e tol d me , ﬁ You

thought that maybe that SS man of 
whom I told you that he wa s so nice , tha t  he had s ent  the m.  But  
they, he  ha dn™t s ent  the m.  They
 just interviewed me 
and they took me to 
t he Ge sta p o headquarte r 
and there they were telling me all 
ki nds of t hings and thr eate ning me
, me with all kinds of things 
and telli ng me what a threat I am t o the, to t he 
Ge r ma n spi r it wit h my doi ng what I a m doing.  And 
then they let me go

they believed it but they let me g

Q: Where was Val erie at the ti

A: To Pola

never he ard fr om her again, and, 
a n d I was brought to t he Ge stap

ou be fore that I visit ed a friend o f

 This is where I went first. 
Q: So you were a rrest ed, not  be cause

 five or s i x people .  It  was clea n.  
We also stopped at t he Pankr us( ph)
 t h at™s the big prison i n Prague. 
 That wa s a hor rible e xperi enc e. 
We ha d to st and t here wi th our bac k t o the wall a n
d our hands stretc h out t hat, tr y to do that for a n  
hour.  And tr y to do t hat for fi ve a nd six hours a
nd you will se e how har d it is
.  Then finally when I  
got into a cell, there were
 Yugoslav partisans in, th
ere was such a st ench, you
 ca nnot i ma gine.  It  
was a stench of, of, of flesh bein
g, being eaten up by illn ess.  And those partis
ans had been beaten 
badl y on t he  soles of thei r feet a nd on their bac ks . 
 Their backs were raw.  There was no bandage, 
no nothi ng.  I re me mber  t hat
 I  tore up che mis e . . . 
A: Cl ot h?  

Q: Huh?  

A:  A rag, a cloth. 

A: No, no. 

Q: Shirt. 

A: No, an unders hirt [t alkover ] .  A
nd I tore it up to stri
ps  in orde r to help on
e of the women to cover 
her back.  There was no salve, 
no medici ne, no not hing and the 
groa ning and t he mo aning I have 
still in my ears.  From 
there we went then on Wi eherachen, 
there was another big place and some  
other  prisons  whic h I  do not  re me mb er int o Berli n. 
 Berli n Al exa nder plat z .  This was t he, the big 
prison in, in Berlin.  While we were there, bo
mbs were fa lling.  Bedbugs
 were one of the first 
things.  You coul d hear th
em when they came do wn
 and fell on you. 
 And t he ste nc h, unbeli eva ble . 
An d while we we re there, the bombs
 wer e  falli ng and pe ople wer e  pra y
ing.  Some were crying and I 
always t old the m, ﬁ D on™t worr y, we™ll get out of 
t his .ﬂ  We did get  out of it.  We c a me t o 
Ravensbruck and until today, I do 
not know how we get 
from Berlin to Ravens
bruck.  I know we 
got  ther e because I  was ther e but  I  couldn™t t el l
 you how.  I onl y know
 when we  arrived in 
Ra vensbr uc k we we re ha d to st and in for mati on, t w
o hol es dee p.  And all t h
e time in the prison and 
on t he tri p fr om the pris on to Ra ve ns bruc k I , I al
wa ys had t h e feeli ng it™ s  not I t hat™ s happe ning to, 
some body e l se, a nd I wa s outsid
e  just watc hi ng what wa s ha ppe
ning.  When we came to 
Ra vensbr uc k I lear ned, I had to wa
ke up.  While we were s t a ndi ng 
t here, there were t wo witnesse s 
of J ehova h c o ming a nd t hey ha d a 
bi g basket i n between them.  They
 were walking on the street the 
so-ca lled La gerstr ass e and a big tr uck was c o ming.
  And the tr uck would, wa s goi ng s o clos e that  
the mirr or that a side mir ror tha t  he had, hit on
e of t he women. 
 The women fell a
nd t h e rear wheel  
we nt ove r her.  All t he  people  who wer e st anding
 t here in for mat ion sear
ched for what.  But  the 
over seer s right away did sick t he dogs at us.  An
d this was the  m
o me nt when I a woke a nd kne w, I  
can™t drea m anymore .  That™s I , that ™ s not s o me
body else .  So some ti mes  
I think t hat that woma n 
died so that I can live, okay.  
__________ Now whi le I  
was  in Vie nna  th ere 
was a gi rl ther e who 
told, who ha d c o me i n fr om Ra vens

  And she  ha d t old me

we st ayed t here, we, there were

There, in every bunk wer e at leas

was really everybody i n there.  
And t hen we were  separat ed a nd I went int o bloc k number one, t h e

ha d to wait out in t he hall wa y for 
the little while and for, for the fe

 After the war, she

Now.  The numb er one  bl

Q: You mentioned that most of
 the people in the num

A: Yes .  

Q: Were they mostly Viennese? 

A: No, no, no.  There wer e

  Were you, wer e

A: No, first of all, 
I do not reme mber our arri val .
  I just know that
 we  went  then  int o

went through a line where this yo

everybody was there. 
 From criminals to 
political prisoners.  They all 
were and all, the women were 
all unwas he d, dirt y.  The cl othes t hat we  rec ei v
ed was not  the cleanest
 either and, and it wa s 
mis era ble.  
Q: You me nt ione d seei ng the t w o wome
n who were  Je hovah™ s Wit nes ses  . . . 
A: Witnesses. 

Q: How,  how could you 
tell that they were? 

A: Oh, the y  had, ever yone in th
e ca mp ha d a di ffe r ent , the triangl
e on the sleeve and the purpl e  
triangle was the Witnesses 
of J ehova h.  And t hose  t w
o wo me n had those triangles. 
Q: So at the time yo
u, you didn™t know th
at they we re . . . 
A: No, I di dn™t.  I onl y learne d later what the y we r e.  I recogniz ed the , the tri angl e and t h e color of it  

but  I did not know.  M aybe some body t o

uldn™t  tell you. 
Q: Do you re me mber , we re you gi ve n a number?  

A: Sure .  Ri ght when you ente re
d you were gi ve n a nu mber and 
you wer e suppose d to se w the  
number on your sle eve .  I had 
some 80,000 and s o me, 18 thousa
nd and s o methi ng, I do not know 
how muc h it  wa s.  I  d
on™t  re me mber a nymore .  
I just know the 
18 t housa nd.  My ba by™ s a sleep. 
Q: What c ol or badge  wer e you gi ve n?  

A: Red.  Red.  All the political 
prisoners had red badges.  The 
so-called, the Jews had yellow,  
yellow triangles and the people wh
o wer e, they wer e the , some of
 the m had blac k triangl es, t hose  
wer e like the , our bl oc k a nd t he, and t he rec eivi ng bl
oc k the one who was a prost
itute or also the, I, I  
think that™s all. 

Q: Was ther e segregati o n bet ween t h e di fferent 
cl asse s of prisoner s?  Or
 did you have . . .  
A: Sur e .  Su re.  Sure , we
 would not have a ssociat ed with cri min
als, right?   The cri minals also had 
black and I think that the political 
prisoners did keep a lot together. 
 By the way, in the same block 
that I was was also Ja n Mc Gloc k(ph).  Jan Mc Gl oc
k( ph) was the sist er of LaGuardia t he mayor of  
Ne w York .  Wh e n th e ca mp  was  lib
er ated, Eise nhower wa nte d  to br
ing her  over on a  s p ecial quota  
but of c our s e La Guar dia  wa s very 
much against  i t .  He wante d he r 
to come the regular way.  She  
wa s there wi th her daught
er and her grandson.  Fo
r a long t i me  they ha d be en in the  bunker beca use  
the SS di dn™ t want the m to be in, in t he populatio
n, in the ca mp popul ati on, 
but fi nall y all three of 
them were released. 

Q: You had quite  a , a  group of pe opl e 
in your bloc k, it s ounds l ike . . . 
A: Yes .  

Q: You me nt ione d severa l pe opl e who reall y . . .  

A: Yes .  

Q: Became  prom
inent later on. 
A: Right, ri ght .  And I  think 
t hat a mount of Ger ma ns , ther
e were al so pe opl e who be ca me  
prominent later.  But I, 
as they were not Aust rians and not from 
Vie nna, I di dn™t kee p tra ck of the m.  
But t he people in our bl ock wer e re ally s pecia l , a
ltogether special people, not
 that I cl ai m t o be a 
speci al peopl e but t he ot hers 
were, mo st of them were. 
Q: Di d you know at t he  ti me  that 
LaGuardi a™s sist er was there? Did 
you know that sh
e was t he . . .  
A: Wh en ,a ft e r 
she came . . . 
Q: Si ster of the ma yor of Ne w York? 

A: Yah, after she came out of the 
bunker and came into our block, 
she of c ours e told us .  And you 
know that she was the one 
we practiced English with
?  I f ther e was a wor d, 
I re me mber  she  br ought  
me a book t h at I shoul d re ad, t he fir st book i n Engli sh in t he c a mp 
was M en Against Dea t h.  Do you 
know?  I™ m s ure you don™ t.  It™s
 about  Sa mmel vise (ph) , the guy wh
o found out in Hu
ngary that s o  
ma ny wome n di ed, di ed i n 
c hildbirth beca use  the  doct ors  di dn™t wash
 ha nds.  That wa
s the first, she,

and ther e were of course wo
rds that I didn™t understand
 in spite of the fact that my English was, let™s 
say, prett y good for Eur ope an sc
hool English.  But th
ere were certai n words that I didn™t  get  a nd 
then she would be the one who, t o
 tell me what it me ans.  So, I 
did __________ s o
mething fo r my 
education i n Ra vensbr uc k. 
Q: Di d you . . . 

Q: Were Je wish pris oners  
in a, in an
y wa y . . .  
A: Se parate. 

Q: Se par a te,  wer e  t hey  in
 any way singled 
out in terms of harsh treatme nt? 
A: No, no.  Har sh treat me nt wa s re
ally for ever ybody the 
same.  It was just the kind of work that  
you could ge t that woul d re move s o
me of the harshness of the life.  
See for instance, 
I worked i n the  
library and I worked in the book 
bi nding.  For me, li fe a s suc h wa
sn™ t  tha t  hars h be ca use I didn™t 

have t o go out i n t he mo

A: St eamroller. 

A: The stea mr oller .  Wo me n use d to ever y day go out and pull  the stea mrol ler and I ha d, later on I  

ma de a friend whom I got away 
from there becaus
e some how prisoner s di d ha
ve s o me i n flue nce on 
what could happe n to pr isoners a nd I  got her a w
a y.  Her n a me wa s Ann e ma
rie Thiele.  She came  
then to America as a co
usin of ours.  We  sent
 he r an a f fidavit .   
A: She was  not  Je wis h. 

A: B ut s he wa s in  ca mp  be
caus e she had an affair with a Je wi sh
 ma n.  And s he wo
re t he black and  
yellow star, so.  We sent 
her then an affi da vit to come  to Am
eri ca.  She was a 
cousin of mi ne. 
Q: Di d you wit ness  othe r br utalit y?  

A: Yes , but, but I do not 
want to tal k about it.  It™s, it™s t o
o, too, it™ s too har mful for  me a nd it  
wouldn™t do any, and it wouldn™t do
 anything.  I have he
re still a big dent wh
ere a SS woman kicked 
me .  I have t his where  an SS wo
man slashed against me  and wh en 
I made like that, 
she sta bbed my 
hand and you s ee t he  finger?  

Q: She stabbed it. 
A: Ye s, s he wa s an gry at  me  be
cause I wasn™t fast enough wit h
 some thi ng or I di dn™t underst and 
what she meant, so she grabbed a s
cal pel a nd s he we nt like 
tha t  to me a nd I  ma de
 of course like that  
and, did you see it?   So, I kne w t h
at there were experi ment s goi ng 
on bec aus e whe n you we nt on t he  
street that ra n bet we en t h e barra cks , t he t wo r ows
 of barra cks, you c oul d h
ear the moaning a nd t he  
groa ning.  And, s o you kne w what
, what ha ppe ning.  Some  . . .  
Q: Me dical  e xperi me nt s?  
A: Yes .  Medical experi me nts a nd some of t he pri s
oners, some, there was one block where they kept  
the pris oners  who had gone 
over the e dge .  And it wa s really te rrible .  It wa s so ba d that  after I ha d  

my fir st son, in, wit hin a very s
hort ti me , he , he found out i f he  crie
d in a ce rtain way, he  could have  
anyt hing he wa nte d, be ca use it did 
re mi nd me so much of Ra vens bruc k 
tha t  I just wa nte d hi m t o be  
quiet  a nd not  cry.  In t his wa y, he
 found out very ea
rly.  Childr e n do. 
A: You c oul dn™t  dri ve  thr ough the  tunnel i n Ne w York. 

A: Oh yea h, a long, lat e , when I wa s in Ne w Yo
rk, for a long ti me whe n
 we went t hrough the  
Linc ol n Tunnel, I felt sic k.  I felt li ke  throwi ng up, di
e , I al wa ys tol d hi m, ﬁP
lease, let™s not,ﬂ told 
my husband, ﬁPle ase , let™ s not go
 thr o ugh the t unnel anymor e.ﬂ   And t hen we t alke d a n d we tal ked , 
and a fter all he™s a ps yc hologist .  And one day he 
s aid, ﬁLet™s go and look wh
at™s what. ﬂ   An d it wa s  
a very sl ow traffic a nd I really looked and you 
kno w wh
at™ s  really a ma z
ing, at the bottom end, 
pardon me , and at the top of the tunnel of the til
es, were bl a ck stripes.  I  do not re me mber now 
anymore whether they were double st
ripes  or singl e stri pes .  I   kne w 
that was in the 
shower room in 
Ra vensbr uc k.  From then I could go t hrough the 
t unnel wi thout any probl e m.  We ha d found out

what caused the problem. 
 So.  Whe n  I already wa
s in A merica I coul d for  instance, not eat steak. 
The smell of sear ed flesh just made 
me sic k.  Cour tesy of Rave nsbr uc k. 
Q: Wh at wa s  the  first  j ob  th
at you ha d there?   Wha t  wa
s  your  fir st wor k det ai l ? 
A: My first work detai l  was in 
the SS li brar y.  Worki n
g with the SS like for 
i nst anc e  in t he li brar y, 
in the book binding and so on, 
we, we, __________ were mostly political prisoners and we had all 
one a dva nta ge.  We c oul d take a s hower onc e  a we
ek because the SS was afra
id that they might get 
lice too if we get lice, right?  So 
t he y, they tri ed to ke ep us cl ean.  And I r e me mbe r  tha t  the s hower  
wa s s o methi ng t hat wa s very, very
 i mportant for us, becau
se it separate d you mor e or  less fr om t he  
dirtiness of the camp.  
Because the camp was not  pa
ved.  Everythi ng was dust .
  And t h en you were  
standing for hours a nd hours a t atte nti on whet her i t wa
s c old or  hot .  It  di dn™t
 do ve ry much to your  
image. 
A: Roll call in the morning. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Ever y mo rning woul d 
you go for roll call?  
A: Ver y e a rl y in t he mor ning.  We
 got up, I don™t re me mb
er the time anymore but it was very early. 
It was eithe r  fi ve, four or fi ve 
o™cl ock.  And we ha d a bout s o a nd 
so ma n y  mi nute s  
to get ready and 
have our br e akfas t, the n we had to st and at atte nti on, at the apell(ph) as it wa s calle d.  And the n we  

wer e st anding there as l o ng as t he 
SS did feel  it wa s good for us .  
And the n a  bell  ra ng and we could  
go to wor k. 

Q: Di d you, wer e, was  it cold?  

A: Sure it was col d.  We  didn™t have any cl othes . 
 We had ver y thin pris on
er™s clot he s.  And you 
didn™t ha ve, you hardly had any un
der wea r.  Lat er on whe n I was a 
little bit fami liar with the camp , 
I went to some of t he Witnes ses of J ehova h who wer e
 in cha r ge of all the clothi ng t hat  had come i n  
and t hey st ol e for me for my bund
le, under wear so that 
I c ould have under w ear. 
 You, you had some  
very fl i msy stuff.  You, you mu
st know from, from t h
e museum a nd so on, 
you know how t hi n the  
clothes wa s that you had and someti
me s when it  got ver y c ol d, we  
got a j acket  which didn™t very  
much against the cold eit her.  And up there it can ge
t ver y col d.  The wi nd is extremel y cold and if 
some body, for insta nce , out
 of fatigue or not feeling well, if
 some body fainted,
 that was fatal 
beca use he wa s just tra mpled, or s h e wa s just tr a m
ple d to de ath.  Not t ha t  somebody picked her up 

and br ought her t o t he doctor, to th
e  hospit al, she wa s just tra mpled 
to de ath.  That™ s i f some bod y  
fel t  si ck, we  always  trie d to le an one a gainst 
t he  ot her t o hol d her up. 
 Sometime s it failed. 
Q: Ho w was you r healt h?  

A: Prett y good until one day I had a, a ver y od
d episode.  I reached fo
r somet hing 
and when I  
reached I , I  collapsed.  I got a
ll bl ue and I don™t know, until to
day I don™t know why.  I j ust  
colla pse d and the y brought me then
 to the so-ca lled Revi er.  Revi er
 is infirmary.  And there the,  
there was a Czech heart speci alist , a prisoner and sh
e l ooked at me and she sa
id, ﬁThat™s the camp.ﬂ 
And I re me mber, I thought , I though
t it™s my heart because I™m all bl
ue  so the y didn™t ha ve any  

me dici ne.  I just was l ying ther e fo
r s o me ti me a n d she ordere d some 
rest .  I we nt to t h e hos pital and 

I stayed in the hospital a few days a
nd then I went out agai n.  That was 
all.  So.  And with this here I 
got  ba ndage d a nd they c oul dn™t  do a nyt hing 
beca use  the y didn™t ha
ve suture material. 
Q: Withthe woun
d on your hand. 
A: Ye ah
, s o it just gre w t he wa y 
it is and when I came to
 Ame rica, t he friend of
 ours  sa id, ﬁ H ave  it  
done, you ca n ha ve t his a ll fi xe d.ﬂ   But the n I ha
d a ba by, I ha d a ne w li fe , a ne w, a ne w house a nd 
really a ne w hus ba nd bec ause  we hadn™t li ved together 
for too long a time .  I di
dn™t wa nt to be  in a  
cast for six months. 
 This is what, no, six weeks.

They were almost as big as

ever y bl oc k got one  of t h ose t hings a nd t his i s th

 In t he mor ning we got

again water with a little bit of some

Wh en I came to camp I had the, th

 t o get i nto a  good bl ock .  
Whe n I wa s in ca mp suc h, I  ha d 
the support of Muti Teichman an

and Helen a nd s o on.  And I had r
eal ly a l ot of support and fr om th

to other pe ople, now ot her pe ople send pac ka g es
 to me.  It wasn™t 
much, because there was 
rationing goi ng on but it wa s always a big joy.  For 
ever ybody around.  Even i f you got onl y a bit e , 
it was already, well I 
mean it was life . 
Q: You woul d share t he pack

ople who di d not s har e a nyt hing wer e 
the Polis h gi rls.  The y di dn™t  gi ve. 

A: Je wis h pe ople  were  ge ntle. 

A: This I don™t know.  But the Po
lish girl, Poland still had a lot of fo
od and they rea
lly got food but 
they rather let it spoil than share it with somebo
dy who wa s not Polis h.  Thi s is some thing I, unti l  

toda y, I do not underst and.  We worked wit h one Poli

me in the library and I 
coul d ne ver underst and ho

the, in book binding, it was intere sting, I really lea r
ned book bi ndi ng.  So if 
you have a  book t o bind,  
don™t bring it  to me. 

Q: Who wa s chec king out  
books at t he  libra ry?  Wh
o was t he li brary for? 
A: The SS peopl e.  That 
was t he SS li brary.   
Q: What s ort s of books  di d t he li brar y have?  

A: I don™t re me mber .  I di

 a single one.  I woul d assu
me, and jus t  an a ssu mpt i on t hat t his  
wer e all  polit ical books .  The y woul dn™t have novels
 or anythi ng of that  ki nd.
  My as sumption.  So. 
Q: But the  pr isoners  were  not  a
llowed to check 
out any books. 
A: No, no, we di d not , t he  pris oners  di d not  ha ve  a lib

 And she told us that 
she was i n  love wit h a 
Jewish man and he 
jilted her and she™s very ha
ppy that she didn™t marry 
him.  So y
ou know what  
kind of a per son she wa s.  She wr ot

s ar e, i s, how is so and so and 
how is s o and s o.  I re me mber a ns weri ng one l ette

who was there.  She is ok
ay, she™s very busy an d 
she™s too lazy to write, 
but I™ll make her write.  Th

Q: Di d you have a ny contact wit h
 the outside world?  For exampl

Dr . Perl  at  al l? 

A: Oh yeah, I had a, I ha d a telegr a m  going thr ou

 would help.  And he 
went wi th the Postal Ser vice to
 Ro mania a nd to Hungary a n d so 
on.  And he got at  those other  
countries, food.  That wa
s reall y al l that count ed. 
 An d t he y we re o ne,  tha t
 wa s one couple that send 
me food.  Then I ha
d another friend, her husban

re absolutely apolitical. 
I, if I ever saw a person as a
political as those two were, they 
were very much concerned with  
holis
tic me di cine  and, a n d, an
d all kinds of t hi ngs  . . . 
A: ____________ ps yc hology.

And after I came home, I didn™t even fi nd the hear t

Because I really thought

A: No, Sol o mon had to go 
to the bathroom and I threw all the pa
pers t hat  I ha d on my lap, I thr e w 
the m o ut .  And wh en we  ca me to
 the bor der, we didn™t ha ve a pass
port, we  didn™t have car pa per s,  
we  didn™t have anybody.  
That™s how much I hated to
 go back.  I didn™t th
r ow it up, out  on purpos e  
and I, but I re me mbe r  the n where it must ha ve ha pp
ened and we found the pa
pers.  We we nt bac k.  
They were still lying th
ere.  But that™s how 
I felt about Europe. 
Q: Wh at had become  of mo st of your
 Jewish friends fro
m before the war?  
A: With some of them, 
I had still contact.  Come when they 
were in America but
 most of them,  
unfortunatel y wer e killed.  Most 
of t h em.  One was in, 
i n London, I  do not  r
ecall anybody el se.  Hi s 
fa mily of course, they were all 
in Ameri ca but, and t h
is one friend I was rea
lly close to, she came 
also to Amer ica and I had contact wit h  her.  And 
that™s about it, I do not 
know anythi ng of anybody 
wh o was cl o se to me in Vie nn a .  It
™s  sad but things were s o, i n su
ch a tumult that fr om one day to

Q: Di d your  fe elings  about fai t h, parti cul
arly the Jewi sh fait
h grow over the war? 
A: I tell you something.  I always
 be lieve d in God and Go
d is everywhere so give it any kind of 
stamp.  It™s Go d.  And I 
really bel ieve that God was 
not only during al
l that time with 
us , that God is  
with us all the time.  I really believe that.  Th
at, and s o me how, s o meti me s 
I feel that it™s like an, 
pardon me, l i ke a n umbr ella a bove us so t hat rea
lly nothing can hit us a
nd I always tell it to the  

childr en.  They, so t hat  
they should feel t he same
 way.  I think that the 
Je wis h r el i gion in, i n  
comparison with the Catholic relig
ion has so much more 
positive.  The Cathol
ic religion has s o  
ma ny re strict ions  whi ch t he Je wis h r el i gion doe sn™t  ha ve . 

Q: Such as? 

A: Su ch as.   Yo u c a n t a lk  to Go

 You ca n, you c an eve n scol d God 
if you fe el li ke it , right?   You ar e 
not forced to do 
this and this, this.  There 
are cert ain restrictions i n  
the Je wis h re ligions too a nd you ha ve
 to obey certain, certain laws but 
it™s not as harsh as the, as the 
Cat holi c re li gion. 

Q: Di d you have any struggle i n
 accepti ng God™s, [talkover] God™
