 I am born 28 of July '37, and I born in  
Athens.  And I spend my  six years -- the firs
t six years in Athens, and after Occupation 
when  the Italian came to Athens, one of them 
was frien d of my father, and he came to our 
house, and he told us about 
the German -- what they are doi
ng in  Europe, and th ey told   
to my father "Mr. Cohen, take your whole

 I born in '3 7.  And all my
 father families and mother 
families liv ing in Saranac, and from
 there, they took them to Poland.
 
 Q: I see.  And the -- after th
e German Occupation of Greece? 
 
 
A: It is not exactly the German because the It
alian fests (ph) wants to occu py Greece, but 
they don't  succeed, and then th
e German came from YugoslaviA
:  They occupied Greece, 
and then they give to the Italian the northern 
side of Greece, and then I told before came 
the Italian officer.  His name is C o llin Enoro
ssi. He came to our ho
use, and he told my 
father this and this wh
at I  told you before.
 
Q: Had your father known th is
 person before this officer --
 
A: Because they have relati

and he go to Saranac 
to the brothers of my  father, and only one 
brother give permission to this man with a 

soldier named Angelo .  And they  bring three 
sons of my  father brother to Athens, and 
they survive with us.
 
Q: Did --
 
A: We go -- we escape to the 
mountains with the pa
rtisans.  We  spend th ere about six 
months, and we escape from the German soldiers
.  They are occupied also the south of 
Greece.  It is a half island.  Its name is 
OgygiA:  There we escap
e from Athens, and from 
there with the help of the partisans, we pa
ss by sea to Turkey, and 
from Turkey, we go to 
Syria, and the city name Halab. And there exactly the English troop defeated the Vischi 

Government, and they catch us like illegal immi
grants and took us  
to the Gaza Strip in 
Army camp, and then come the 
Jewish agency, and we escape,
 and we came to Tel Aviv 
like illegal citizens.

Only my father knows the all 
others, andone 
day he take a 
cab, two cabs, and they take all the family w

And then we met the partisans,
 an d they guard us, and we liv

them till there is occasion to pass 
the road to the 
sea to Turkey.
 
Q: What was it like to be a child

right are from Monarch, Monarch from the King. 
 But during the war, they fight together 
against the Nazi enemy, but we ar
