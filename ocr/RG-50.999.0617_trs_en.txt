around 1919 or 1920.He had recently em igrated theref rom  Poland.
 
 
On thism ap of Germ any, the arrow pointstoBerlin, where Harry and hisfamily lived 
when he was born.W hen Harry was 1 year old, in1938,af am ily f riend, who was a policeman, 

warned the Markowic zs of  an impending outbreak of  violence against Jews in Germany. Harr y 

andhisf am ily escaped to Belgium .
 
 
In May
 
1940, Germ any invaded Belgium .This photo shows Belgian ref ugees

head toward the German troops.
 
 
T he Markowicz f am ily tried toescape and cross theborder to France. On this map, 
we see anarrow on the right pointing to where thef am ily hadbeen livin g, in Antwerp, Belgium . 

T hef am ily tried to cross theborder to Francebut they were denied entry. T hey renteda beach 

house in La Panne,Belgium . The second arrow, on the lef t,points to La Panne.
 
 
In 1942, Harry and his fam ily went into hiding in Brussels. Harry andhis siblings 
were placed separately in children's hom es and with diff erentfam ilies. Harry li ved with the 

Vanderlindenf am ily until the liberation of Belgium  inSeptem ber
 
1944. Here we see Harry with 
Mrs .
 
Vanderlinden.
 
 
Af t e r  
the war, the Markowic zs resum ed their life in Brussels. Here we see Harry and

Ma rk o wi c z.
 
 
[Applause]
 
Harry, thank youf or joining us and being willi ng to be our 
F
i rs t  
P
erson today. And I know you 
have a lot to share with us in apretty short tim e so we should probably just get started.
 
 
Your father settled inBerlin in 1919, married your mother in 1926. By thetim e you 
were born in 1937, Hitler and the Nazis hadbeen in powerf orfour years already. Bef ore we 

turn to what happenedaf ter your birthand the events you'll describeto us, tell us,f irst,a lit
t le  
bit about your fam ily and their life bef ore youwere born.
 
As I understand it, they led a m iddle class life. My f ather was in thefur business
, w
holesale. In 
it quite comf ortably. They were m oderately rel igious.
 
Your father had served in the FirstW orldW ar. Do you know anything abouthis service? 
 

Not except that he was 15 years old when hewas draf ted. He never talkedabout it. Oncem y 

wif e asked him  what it was like and he just said it was terrible. Also,I know that he must have 

been in the cavalry becauseone time whenwe were on vacation at a beach, my brother saw 

two horsem en riding long theocean and when they got close, it realized oneof  them  was m y 

fa the r.
 

Hitler cam e topower in 1933. So your parents experienced his rise to power andf our yea
rs 

under Hitler, before you were born. Didthey talk to you later aboutwhat lif e was likef orthem  

in Berlin after Hitler cam eto power? 
 

No, they didn't. Infact, we never talked
 
--
 
m y fam ily, we never talked about what happened to 
u s. Afte r
 
--
 
during thewar. It was a taboo subject, I think.
 
You did share with methat yourfather was am ong those whof ought, and these were your 

words, that the riseofNazism  couldn't last. 
Wi
ll you say a little bitm oreaboutthat?
 
Right. He was one of thefew people who thought the world wouldn't let Hitler go on. You 

 
3
 
m entioned thepoliceman who was our nanny, m y brother and sister's nanny's 
fi an c é
.  He  wa s  
a policem an who m yf ather rem ainedf riendswith. By the tim e I was born they couldn't have a 
nanny because of theNurem berg Laws didn't allow young wom en to work f or Jewish f amilies. 

But anywa y, this policem an warnedm y f atherthatthings were going to get really bad and that 

he should get out of the country and gethisfam ily out.
 
And that happened atabout the tim eof  Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, which took 

place November
 
9 through 10, 1938.So f rom that warning, it sounds like your fam ily f led f rom  
Berlin toBelgium . Justprior to that yourfather had lef tGermany andgone to
 
--
 
excuse me, 
had gone to A
achen, Germ any
,  
but lef tand then returned. Can youtell us why he lef tf irst tim e, 
cam e back, and thenwhat happened with the warning about Kristallnacht?
 
He lef tbecauseof  the warning f rom  thepolicem an. He tookm y brother and sister, were older
, 
wi t h  h
im ;
 
went toAachen, which is a resort place near theBelgium and Dutchborders. From  
there they were supposed to meet with a smuggler to cross theborder.T his I learnedf rom m y 

brother who is theonly survi ving m em berof m y f am ily now.
 
T hey were takenby this wom an 
sm uggler and they wal ked through theforest. They didn't goto the regular custom  place.They 

ran into a Dutchpatrol who turnedthem over to the Germ an authorities.
 
 
Leaving the country was not illegal at the time. Inf act [Indiscernible] but they wanted 
tom ake sure that people leaving paid their taxes, which m y father had done. Inother words, 

he andthe other adults were put in jail in Aachen. Af ter the police was able to check thatm y 

father paid his taxes he was released on thecondition thathe leave the country. I thinkhehad 

one m onth.
 
T o leavef or good. Doyou know why when he went toAachen withyour two siblings, wh y your 

m other and youdid not go with him ? Any idea wh y? 
 

W e ll
,  
it would have beenm ore diff icult
 w
ith me, because I was only 1
-
year
-
o ld .  A ls o ,  up  unt il 
then the Germ ans, theNazis, seem ed to have focusedonm en, noton womenand children.
 
Your father, had he applied to leave the country? Had heappliedfor a visa to com e tothe 

United States at any point?
 
Yes, they had appliedbut it was very diff icultto com eto the UnitedStates. It was ver y diff icult 

to get a visa. T hey wer en't issuing visas, especially to Jews even though there were visas 

available. And going to other countries also was very dif f icult. Som y father had to rely on this 

idea that Hitler would be stopped by the restof the world.
 
You toldm e that whenyour f ather left with your siblings to Aachen and you and yourm other 

rem ained in Berlin,Germ an police came to your apartment lookingfor your dad.
 
Ye s .
 
I th i
nkthey cam e to the houseand asked your m other where yourfather's whereabouts were.
 
I thinkthey just called from  Aachen.And, yes, m y m other andfatherhad workedout whatthe 

plan was, to tell them  that m y father took m ybrotherand sister on vacation to Aachen because 

that's wherepeople went for vacation.
 
So they bought it.
 
Yeah, they bought it.
 
T he warning that this policem an, who hadbeen the 
f iancé
 
of  yourform er nanny, the warning 
thathe gave about the pending violence against Jews, he was likely
 
speaking about 
Kristallnacht. And on this night,for the audiencem em bers, of  Novem ber
 
9 through 10,1938, 
violence was directed at Jews all over Germ any and Austria. On that night some300 

synagogues were burned in Germany. Sothat really com pelled your 
f am i
ly to leave. Your
 
fatherf irst going to Aachen.
 

 
4
 
 
T ell us about the decision then tom ove yourfam ily f rom  Berlin toBelgium.
 
B y th a t tim e
 
--
 
we were  gone bef ore then.
 
You got the warning and then lef t.
 
Right. My f atheronhis own af ter hisf irst attem ptf ailed, he went back to theborder. I don't 
know how he got across but he got into Belgium .T henhefounda Belgian m an who lived near 

theborderbut worked in Germ any and commuted every day. He arranged,paidthism an a 

large sum  ofm oney
,  
to bring us a
cross the border a
s 
hisfam ily, passed us off. My m other and 
m y two siblings and I. And that worked out
 
f i ne .
 
 
At the very m om ent that we were at the Germ an border, Hitler was gi ving a speech, 
a very im portant speech on the radio. Inf act
,  
it was translated inother languages and in other 
European countries the speech was about the partof  Czechoslovakia that was inhabitedby 

several m illion Germ an
-
speaking peopleandHitler was claim ing the territory on the grounds 
that these
 
Germ an people living in C zechoslovakia were being attacked by the Czech 
governm ent.That wasa time that the FrenchandBritish primem inisters met with Hitler and 

concededthat he could have thatterritory.
 
And that was 1938. Right?
 

1938.
 
But youm ade it intoBelgium and Ithink youwent to Antwerp.
 
Righ t .
 
So that was your new home.And it would rem ainthat until Germ any in vaded Belgium  in 

Ma y
 
1940.W hat was life like for your fam ily in Antwerp, in Belgium ,during that period? 
 
I think we lived quite well at thattim e. My f ather had been in thefur business but that wasn't 

what he was doing. He was invol ved in exchange of  currency. Ever ybody expected the war to 

break out, so theBelgian m oney was not consideredan im portant currency but thedollar and 

the British pound were. So people were trying to leave the country vi a thesehard currencies 

andm y father was involved in exchanges ofcurrency. It was legal until the Germ ans occupied.
 
But that'show he wasm aking his living while you were there.
 
 
Germ any attacked Poland Septem ber
 
1939
, 
W
or ld W ar  I I b e gan
 b
ut not yet in 
Belgium . Andthat happened when Germany invaded Belgium  in May
 
1940, May
 
10, 1940. A 
few days af ter that your family f ledfor France. Tell us about yourf amily's leaving f or France 

andabout your attem pt to try to get into 
F r anc e .
 
W hen Germ any invaded Belgium, Holland, and Luxemburg ontheirwa y to France,abouttwo 

m illion Belgiansout of eight m illionpopulation tried to leave the country and go to France.So 

we were not theonly ones leaving. It was a mass exodus. My parents and anotherf am ily that 

we were related to,plus threeotherf am ilies, rented a truck,a large truck, with a driver to drive 

us to France. But when we got to
 
--
 
Sof ivef am ilies together. So whatever you could take, youput in the truck.
 
Right. Couldn'ttake too much.
 
Righ t .
 
W ehad to leave pretty quickly. T he Germ ans invaded May
 
10. My brother and sister's 
birthdays were May
 
14, and that's theday we  lef t.W e got toAachen and the driver said he 
wasn't going any f urther. He dropped us off by the sideof  the road.
 
W ithall of  your belongings and just said I'm stopping, I'm not going any f urther?
 
Righ t .
 
O k.  

It could have beenf or any number of reasons. One, the roads wereclogged with people 

 
5
 
walkin g, on bicycles, horseback.
 
W hen yo u  de s c r i b ed t ha t  t o m e
 -- 
plus you'vesharedhistorical photos of  that. It's likeas soon 
as we see in war m ovies, literally, as you said, two m illionpeoplef leeing, onf oot,onbikes in 
carts, in the truck thatyou had rented. Is thatwhat it was like, just masses of people try
ing to 
get out? 
 
Yes. My m em oriesdon't start yet so it's not my o wn m em oriesbutthat's the way it was 

described to m e. 
 

 
So we had to walk therest of the way. M y f ather and theotherf am ilies that we were 
related to bought a Sur
re
y, which is a kindof bicycle contraption with three orfour wheels that 
you f ind at resorts, that people rent to pedalaround.
 
Som ainly for pleasure, forf un,but youbought it to carry your goods.
 
Exactly. And the other fam ily hada 3
-
year
-
old girl, m y cousin, and I,we were put on top. 
Ever ybody else was pushing and pulling thisthing to theborder.
 
W hen we got there, we were 
notallowed into France because we were stateless.W edidn't haveany nationality. T hey 

allowed in Belgians, Dutchpeople.
 
Explain wh y you didn't have any nationality, why you would be labeled stateless.
 
Becausem y parents had left Poland, they lost the Polishnationality. My f ather lived in 

Germ any 19 years, m y m other14 years,
 
but they hadn't becom e Germ ans. It takesa long tim e 
to becom e citizens inEuropean countries.
 
And they weren't Belgian.
 
And they weren't Belgian either. I was born in Germany af ter the Nurem berg Laws took 

relations f rom  Jews.
 
So essentially it says you have nonationality andbecause youhave no nationality, you 

couldn't com e in.
 
Right.W e didn't have any docum ents.
 
So you were blocked.
 
Righ t .  My f a m ily we n t  b a c k  a lit t le  b itf rom
 
the border. T his is along the F
rench seashore,a lot 
of  resorts. People gothere during the sum mer. But during the war there's nobody there so they 

were 
able to renta house. My f atherdidn'thave any m oney lef t.W hat happened was just 
bef ore the invasion started, he hada partner.He and the partnerboughtf urs.I guess they 

thought it was better to havef urs than tohave cash.Sohe investedall of  hism
oney in f urs 
with the partner who whenthe Germ ansmoved in, he took off inhis car which was loadedwith 

all thefurs. Som y f ather didn't have any m oney. T he upshot of thiswas they sub
-
rented the 
vil la to other refugeeswho were com ing back f rom the bor
de r .
 
W ho also had been turned away like you.
 
Had beenturnedaway. My brothers told me that there were like 50people in this house. At the 

tim e,the British had sent soldiers to France to helpthe French to stop the Germ an invasion. 

Belgium  declared itself neutral, like inW orld War I, but in both cases Germany didn't expect 

that. So the British troops waited at the border.W henthe Germ ansm oved into Belgium , the 

British troops moved into Belgium . 
 
 
And thepicture with the refugees going onedirection, theBritish soldiers going in 
theother direction. My f irstm em ory in m y lifetim edates back to seeing British soldiers, who 

were no threat us. I was less than3 years oldso I didn'tunderstandwhat was going on. But I 

was reacting to m y mother'sf eelings.
 
They were not athreat.
 
 
Inm y m emory, I remem ber falling asleep.W e were on the side of the road. I 
rem em berf alling asleep.W hen I woke up, the soldiers were gone.And Iasked my mother 

 
6
 
where the soldiers wer e and she replied thatthey were gone. And I knew that she was anxious 
or af raid. I couldfeel that. In
 
f act, inthe whole war I 
rem em ber being af raid because I always 
knew when the adultsaroundm e were af raid.
 
So you're in this little resort town of La Panne, which was thenoccupied by theGermans.
 
So  
oncethey occupied it, you returned to Antwerp which, of  course, was also underGerman 

occupationas was allof Belgium .W hat awaited you when you returned?T ell us about going 

back to Antwerp and whathappened when you got back there.
 
W eha d t o  wa l k  b
ackbut on the way we were pickedup by Germ an trucks, em pty trucks that 
were com ing backf rom  the front.They carried the refugees,probably to get them off  the road, 

so they could travel on the road.T heyf ed us. They weren't concerned they were Jewish o
r 

anything. They were concerned with the war eff orts. And we got back to our apartment and 

m oved back in, like many other people com ing back.
 
Once Belgium was occupied,there was 
no point going to France anym ore as Francewas also occupied.
 
R
igh t .  Righ t .
 A
nd it wasn't long bef ore I think, if I rem em ber right, yourf ather was ordered to go 
tof orced labor by the Nazis. But hedidn't do that. Right?
 
Right. Actually, thefirst six m onthsof occupation nothing was doneabout Jews in particular. 

And then in October of 1940, they started putting in anti
-
Je wish  la ws.
 
The f
irstone was that 
Jews had to register where they lived with the Jewish councils the Germ ans, inthe countries 

they occupied,they set up Jewish councils. And this was the way they m anaged the Jew
is h  
population, through the Jewish councils,m aking them  responsiblef or carrying out the order.
 
By doing that, they had your address. They knew exactl y where you lived.
 
Yes. In Belgium  therewere no ghettos unlike Eastern Europe. But they had the addresse
s 

where you li ved.
 
Righ t .  Righ t .  Righ t .
 
 
W hat were some of the other restrictions that you know about?
 
J
ews couldn't own radios
. T
here was a curf ew f or everybody but Jews had anearlier curf ew. 
J e ws
 
--
 
e ver ybody had to have an identity card af ter age 16 andup.You had to carry an 
identity card. If you were Jewish it was stam ped Jew.
 
 
T hey didn'thave all oftheir special requirem ents, which is [Indiscernible] it was 
st e p -
by
-
step. So you got used to onething and then there was anew thing. Professionals 
co
uldn't work. Doctorscouldn't practice. Lawyers couldn't practice. Jews couldn't be civil 
servants, teachers, professors.
 
My father was notaffected by that becausehe was not a 
prof essional. He was in business on hisown. 
 

Right. And then at some point he
 
got calledfor forced labor.
 
Right. T heneventually they started
 
--
 
Jewish councils started dem anding that Jewish men, 
able
-
bodied men, report for work in Germ any andalso to buildf ortif ications along the coastof  
France andBelgium ,the AtlanticW all th
at was built to prevent the allies f rom landing.
 
 
Again, they were ver y deceptive. Thef irstm en who were drafted towork were m ade 
to write postcards home, send these cardshom e with messages like we're working, we're fed, 

we're housedand everything is f ine. Sothat they were able to convince otherpeople to go.
 
T hey didn't getenough m en sothey alsohired, actually hired, Belgium men to work in 

Germ any but they wer e treateddiff erently. They were paid a salary and so on. They were not 

slave laborers lik
e the Jews.
 
W hat did your father do?
 
Oh,m y father. I'm sorry about that. My f atherdidn't trust the Germans. So hedecided
 
--
 
he  
didn't think them en were going to com eback. This is what happened. On the day thathewas 

 
7
 
supposed to report for work, he di
dn't go.W eleft Antwerp surreptitiously and moved to 
Brussels where m y parentsdid notdeclare where we lived, didn't give our address tothe 
Jewish council.
 
So they didn't register there, so sortof  living off the grid a littlebit, as people say today. 
Rig h t ?
 
Righ t .  Ye s .
 
You said they weren't hiding at thetim e but living sort of  anonym ously.
 
Ye s .
 
W hat were circum stances likef or them oncethey m oved into Brussels?
 
Pretty m uch like inAntwerp. M y f ather continuedhis business. My brother and sister went 
to  

school
.  
I stayed hom e with m y m other. I
t  
didn't really change much.
 
T hat is,until later, September
 
1942. You hadnow been living in Brusselsf or som e 18 months 
at thatpoint.T hat's when your parentsm adethe really trul y profound decision to take the 

fam ily into hiding. Tell us what got them tothat point to say we're going to hide our entire 

fam ily, and what they did.
 
Right. In August of 1942, the Germ ans hadtwo or three raids in Antwerp, the city where we 

had lived bef ore.T heycam e atnight, surroundedthe Jewish area.And inAntwerp with the 

assistance of the Antwerp police they went to all the apartments where Jews lived and picked 

up wholef am ilies, children,old people, sickpeople, andtook themaway.
 
Entire neighborhoods.
 
Entire neighborhoods,
 
yes. And the word gotback to Brussels pretty quickly, f rom people who 
hadescaped. So instead of sleeping atour apartment that night, we stayed
 
--
 
m y m otherhad a 
brother who lived notfar away. I don't know how f ar but not in the Jewish area. So we sta
yed 

with m y uncle and aunt, some of us, and some of us stayed with f riends who alsodidn't live in 

Jewish neighborhoods. Then we went back during the daytim e.And afew days later it was a 

raid in Brussels. W e were not there.So we escaped.T hat was a wise
 
decision on the part of 
m y parents.T hat's when we went intohiding.
 
 
T here were several undergroundorganizations, so Jews and non
-
Jews that helped 
Jews to f indhiding places, especially f or children.They separated the children because it's
 
--
 
for one thing, it's harder to hide when you have children totake careof . So the children were 

separated, sent to separateplaces. And theparents were not toldwhere the children were. It 

was hard enoughfor the parents to give awa y their children to strangers. They didn't know 

where they were going. But not to be able tovisit them , not knowing where
 
--
 
if  they would ever 
see them  again. Of  course, I wasn't thinkingof  itf rom  that point of view at the tim e. I was 

thinking f rom m y point of  view, separated f rom  m y
 
f am ily.
 
And your brotherand sister who were older were very a ware of all the risks and dynam ics 

invol ved.
 
Right. Of course, Ididn't becauseI was too young tounderstand.
 
So where did youf irst go when theyf oundhiding for you? 
 
T he  f
irst place was nei
ghbors
™
, anelderly couple. I don't know how m y parents knew them but 
they lived in theneighborhood. Of course these were non
-
Jews. My parents paid them tomove 
away f rom  the Jewish neighborhoodand take us with them .That way we could pass notf or 

their 
children but possibly their grandchildren. 
 
 
So the threeof us went with thisf am ily, this couple. And we stayedwith them a short 
tim e.I have no ideahow long it was. It imm ediately becam ea problem  because they didn't 

feed us, which Ididn't care about
 
because my brother and sisterdid. But the big problem  was 
af ter af ew weeks, m aybe, they decided tom ove back totheir old neighborhood, the Jewish 

 
8
 
neighborhood, where there were lots of vacant apartm ents sincethe Jews had been taken 
away. And that was 
a problem .
 
 
T he otherproblem  was that the 18
-
year
-
old gr andson lived with them as well and he 
joinedthe Reichstag party, af ascist politicalparty thatexisted in Belgium before the war. He 

joined the m ilitia.
 
T he  f a scist.
 
T hef ascist m ilitia. And eventually that m ilitiabecam e incorporated in the Germ an Arm y.There 

were about25,000 Belgian young m en who became part of the Germ an Arm y.
 
So it wasn't going to work to have three Jewish children living in that homenow.
 
Right. T he grandson wasn't going toturn in his grandparents but it still wasn't a good idea. I 

don't remember how all of  thishappened butwe were takenaway f rom there. And next I was 

with m y sister only in a children's hom e, in the countryside. I don't know who the other children 

were, whe
ther they we re Jewish or not.
 
 
My brother came to vis it us andhe realized there were some Jewish adultshiding 
thereas well and that made itm ore dangerous. As children we could pass butf oradults, 

especially sincem ost of the Jews in Belgium were notf rom  Belgium .T hey were foreigners. 

And they didn't speak the language well so they could be easily identif ied.
 
So we toldm y 
m other andagain we were taken away f rom there. 
 
 
Ne xt I wa s with  Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden.T here was a picturedof m e with a wom an 
standi
ng behindm e ina park.That was Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden. I stayedwith them ,andm y sister, 
for a while.
 
I didn't know, but in the same neighborhoodm y brotherwas stayin g with another 
f a m ily.
 
But you didn't know that.
 
No. I didn't know that. T hey didn't tell me becausethey thought I m ight reveal thattom y little 

f riends.So I didn't know he was there.
 
 
T he Gestapo cam e to the house. It was the Gestapo intelligence, not lookingfor
 
--
 
there were two other Jewish children besides m y brother. Didn't care about the Jewish 

children.T hey camef or, m ore im portantly, the son of thef am ily, anadult who was working in 

Germ any on the railroad. Heand som eother Belgians worked in the railroad yard. After a 

while they got leave to go home.They gotf ive days vacation. But ittook them  threedays to get 

home because thetrains weren't running. They were bombed. So they were late getting back.
 
 
Unfortunatelyf or them  the railroad yard had beenbom bedby the allies in the 
m eantim e so they suspected thatone orm ore of these
 
young Belgian workers hadprovided 
theallies with inform ation about the railroad yard, sothey were arrested whenthey cam eback. 

And theGestapo intelligence cam eto thehouse to lookfor a radio transmitter,apparently. 

T hey were looking behind pictures and so on, everywhere. T hey didn'tf ind anything. Andas 

they were leaving they told m y brotherand the other two Jewish kids, in German, thatthey wil l 

be backfor them the next day.
 
Laterm y brotherf oundout whathappened. But they didn't 
com e back. T
hey could have taken them  with them  in their car but they didn't.
 
So then m y 
brother came over to wherem y sister and I were staying.
 
T o the Vanderlinden's?
 

Yes. Even warned us that theGermansm ight come in theneighborhoodthe next day. So we 

le ft. I we n
tto stay with m y parents. Every tim e I retrieved places, I stayed with m y parentswho 
lived in a house that looked like
 
--
 
well, their apartment looked like itwas vacant. It was 
custom ary in Belgium  to cover the windows, vacant houses, with newspapers over the 

windo ws. And the landlord obviously knew they li ved there.
 
There was a neighbor acrossthe 

 
9
 
street who did thef ood shoppingf or them  and broughtover. Also m y brother and sister wrote 
letters to m y parents. That was the only way t o keep intouch.T hey wrote tothe neighborwho 

brought over them ail to m y parentsandthentookm y m other's letters tomy brotherand sister 

and m ailed them
, t
omake itm ore diff icult to trace back. 
 
 
Af ter that, m y parentsusedthe sam e strategy. T hey asked the Vanderlind
en s ,  
through theunderground organization. My f ather never lef t the apartm entfortwo years. My 

m other, who was blond and blue
-
eyed, Aryan type, although she was ableach blond
 
--
 
[Laughter]
 
Could pass but she didn't know
 
--
 
she new several languages but she didn't know the national 
language of Belgium ,French and Dutch.Sothat was always a risk for her to go out.So she 

didn't goout. She came to visit m e. Idon't know how she did it because intheory she wasn't 

supposedto know where I was. But shefound
 
out.
 
 
Anyway
 
--
 
I'm  sorry, I lost m y train of  thought.
 
You were at the Vanderlinden's but I think you were going to tell us about persuading the 

Vanderlindens to move
 
--
 
their hom e was sort of  in the country, a little biton theoutskirtsof 
to wn . B u tI t
hink your m om  asked them  tomove
 
--
 
to actually m ove you with them  into 
B ru sse ls.  

Right. T hey li ved actually on the edge of Brussels, and across the street there wasf arm land. I 

showed up withm y sister one day, so the neighbors knew we were not their children, the 

Vanderlindens. Som y parents asked them  tom ove and they did it.They m oved into Brussels. 

And they were in a neighborhood where people didn't know them.
 
T hey hadat least onechild them selves?
 

T hey hada daughter.She was around18. Idon't know
 
her age.
 
So all of youm oved into Brussels.
 
W e moved into Brussels. Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden had to change work, change jobs, but they we re 
wi llin g t o  d o  it .  
S
of rom then on I lived with them  until liberation. I could passf or their son. So I 
was hidden
,  
wh a t th
eycall a hidden child, but I was hidden in theopen.
 
You were their child as far asthe outside world 
knew.
 
Right. Only thing that was hidden was m y real identity. I had afalse identity, different name. I 

hadtopretend to be their son. I had to pretend tobe Catholic. There were a num berof  

im portantdistinctions between m y own identity and what I was pretending tobe.
 
Do  
you 
recall what that was like for you? I know you were ver y young. Do you rem ember any 
of  thefeelings aroundthat tim eor any incidents? Because you were young. But what do you 

r e m em be r  of t h at  tim e?  
 
I remember quiteaf ew things. A lot of the traum atic parts, separation and so on, were things 

thatI couldn'tunderstand,obviously at that age. So I kindof feel that it was like swallo w
ing 
som ething that youdon't digest.And it staysthereforever.
 
You toldm e aboutone incident, Harry, where you were actually outon the street, if I 

rem em ber right, and you saw your m om . Can you tell us aboutthat? 
 
Right. I had beentoldhow to behave,
 
how to act, things todo, things nottodo.Obviously I 
was not supposed to tell anybody that I was Jewish, that I could understand Germ an soldiers. 

Not topee inpublic because in Europeboys were not circum cised, things like that. Nobody 

said what I should do if I ran intom y m other in the streetsbecause itwas not expected andyet 

it happened. I was playing on the sidewalk wit h another boy.W e were throwing the ball back 

andforth. And then I saw
 
--
 
well, f irst I saw in the distance somebody approachin
g be h i nd  m y 
f riend.As the person got closer,I realized it was m y mother walking i n my direction. As shegot 

 
10
 
closer and closer,eventually she passed right next tom e. Ididn't look ather.I could have 
touched her. 
 

And shedid the same.
 
Shedid the same
.  

She just passed by.
 
Right. After a while I said Ihave to go in. Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden ran a store. I went in the backand 
toldm y f riend Ihad togo home. My m other was waiting theref orm e.
 
Harry, there's so many details that you couldshare with us but we
 
won't have time to get into 
andI wish we could. You continued living with the Vanderlindens and then in August or 

September of 1944, as the Germans were retreating, your m other showed upand took you 

f rom  the Vanderlindens
. I
t wouldn'tbe long after that
 
that you were liberated.Tell us what you 
can about your mother com ing to get you and then about what you recall about your liberation. 
 
W
ell,m y m other showed up oneday and said she wantedm e to com eand stay with my f ather 
andher.She didn't say wh y. I was to the point I had gotten very close to the Vanderlindens. I 

knew I had real parents but being with theVanderlindens was normal. Life was norm al.
 
Seven days a week,24 hours aday for a long tim e.
 
W ecould gooutside and speakopenly in French. Andnobody would botherus. It was ver y 

different with m y parents. My m other, we whis peredbecause we spoke in German. It was a 

gi veawa y. So in every respect living with theVanderlindens was preferable.
 
For a littleboy, yeah.
 
For m e.
 A
l s o  f o r Mrs .
 
Vanderlind
en. She was ver y attached tom e,too.W ebonded.She 
played with m ea lotand soon.
 
 
Som y m other said, well, after the liberation,which was expected im m inently, she 
said you can com e back to live with the Vanderlindens. SoI went wi th her.We were ona 

street car. My m other
 
--
 
usually in thepublic, like onthe street car, she was nervous but this 
tim e she was less.Som ehow I knew that. Atsom e point she pointed out the window and said, 

ﬁL
ook,
ﬂ 
again whispering in German. SoI looked. And rightnext to the street carthere was a 
little Germantruck pulled by ahorse
. I
tm ighthave run outof  gas orhadengine trouble. On top 

of  the truckthere was a soldier lying down on top with apretty heavy m achine gun. I was used 

to seeing German soldiers walking b y proudly, notf earf ul. But this guy looked strange. Hekept 

looking upat thebuildings on both sides.It was very strange behavior. And then m y m other 

whispered again. Shesaid the Germ ans are running away. I rem ember that always. 
 

Of course you have.And then, of course, she took youa park where you described it as kind 

of  an atm osphere of happy pandem onium . Ibelieve those were your words. Tell usabout 

go i n g 
to  
t h is pa rk.  
 
Yes, af ter I had beenwith m y parents af ew days, you couldhear cannonf irenotf ar away, in 

thedistance but getting closer. And then one m orning m y m other said we were going to a park. 

I didn't quite understand what was going on. Iaskedher why m y f ather's not com ing, since 

we're going out. And she said
 
--
 
well, I think she told m e
 
--
 
described it that the alliesare here 
andthe Germ anshave run away. So Iaskedher about m yf ather and she said, well, he's not 

ready tof ace people.He had been inside.
 
As you said,he stayed inside their hiding placef or two years.
 
Ye s .
 
W ithout going out. Even thenhe couldn't come out.
 
Right. He wasn't ready.
 
 
So we got in the streets and there were m any, many people going in the same 

 
11
 
direction.At some point we passed a tanka Germ an tank, that was onf ire, the 
t u rre t
 
was on 
f ire. I didn't know what happened.I realized later it was theBelgianUnderground whoprobably 
threw a Molotov cocktail on the tank.It was on f ire. Of  course, being a little boy I was 

fascinatedby thef ire. So I stopped cold in my tracks and stood there. Butmy m other was 

im p
atient, grabbedm eby m y arm . I rem em ber that. Pulled me.W e continued. 
 
 
More and more people were com ing out of houses andall going to the sam e 
location, the park.W e got thereand there was this strange sight.T here was a row of British 

tanks and Briti
sh soldiers and Belgian civilians kissing, hugging. For  m e the world had 
changed. My m other and I walkedover to atank where there was a soldier standing by him self  

on the tank.W e looked up. He lookeddown.W ehad no com mon language. And then he 

leaned over and put out his arm . My m other handedm eup. He tookm e in his arms andheld 

m e. I lookeddown onm y m otherf or instructions, I guess. I didn't know what todonext.
 
T his soldier holding you.
 
T he soldier holding m e, sm iling. She said, 
ﬁG
ive  h im  a  kiss.
ﬂ 
So I kissed him  on the cheek.And 
again I lookedather and she was crying. I couldn'tunderstand why she was crying. She sort 

of  explained she was crying out of  joy. T hat was a concept I wasn't used to. 
 
Harry, you were liberated, Brussels was liberated, you were liberated, in thefall of 1944. The 

war would continue inEurope, of course, until thefollowing Ma y of 1945. You did go back to 

the Vanderlindens
. D
oyou know why your parents took youbackto the Vanderlindens during 
th a t tim e?  
 

For one thing,
 
m y m other prom ised that I could go back.
 
Shedid prom ise you could go back, yes.
 
Other than that I really don't know. I askedm y brother recently and he saidhedidn't know, 

m aybe becausem y parents' apartm ent was very sm all. And in addition to us, one of
 
m y 
cousins
 
--
 
the uncle and the aunt who we stayed with, they had a son and a daughter. T hey 
were deported on the last train toAuschwitz from  Belgium . My cousin was in hiding som eplace 

else. My parents picked her up.Sothere wer e many of  us.
 
 
B u t  ba sica
lly, looking back, Ibelieve that I wanted to live with the Vanderlindens 
because as I was saying before, it was normal as opposedto
 
--
 
in addition to everything el se, 
without even understanding what it meant tobe Jewish, I was asham ed. Ididn't tell anybody I 

was Jewish. I was in my 20s before Iadm itted to anybody that I was Jewish. I had no idea how 

long I stayed with the Vanderlindens after liberationuntil If igured out, much later.
 
 
W hile I was with them , well, as soon as Brussels was liberated, eve
rybody had flags 
on their houses, allied f lags, British, French,Belgian, Am erican, Russian
 
--
 
only one on the 
b lo ck.  

[Laughter]
 
T here were hugef lags. I don't know how people m adethem . They were the size of  double 

sheets. I guess they used sheets. But how they got the dyes and everything, I have no idea. 

But they were hanging on thefacades of houses.
 
 
So after liberation, af ter I was back with theVanderlindens, one day I was outside 
andI noticed there were no f lags.T hey were gone. Not a singlef lag.
 
So I went backand asked 
the Vanderlindens where are thef lags. She told m e that the Germans m ight come back. I 

knew she was af raid.
 
 
It was years 
bef ore I 
realized that it was the timeof  theBattle of theBulge which 
took place in Belgium, the big Germ a
n  
--
 
the last counteroff ensive of theGermans.
 
So they were genuinely worried the Germ ans were going to com e right back in.
 

 
12
 
Yes. Infact, they almost succeeded in cutting off  theallied troops. But they didn't.Sothis 
happened.If  youf ind the history books, ithappenedat Christm astim e. So it was December, 

January. So I was with  theVanderlindensf ive, six m onths af ter the liberation.
 
W e're just about at the end of tim e.T here's so muchm ore you could share with us, but Ido 

want
 
--
 
two  th in gs I wa n t to 
ask youabout before we close. One, when you were back withthe 
Vanderlindens, Ibelieve, your brother and sister were som ewhere else. Your parents wentto 

get them  andthey hada very f rightening experience. Sharethat with us.
 
Right. My brother andsister, by then they we re in them ountainousarea of Belgium . My 

parents couldn'tpick them  upatf irstbecauseit required trains,and the trains were being used 

by the alliedtotransport them ilitary equipm ent and so on. So they hadto wait. And they had 

to  
get perm ission totravel. So eventually they went to pickthem up to pick up my brotherand 
sister. But on the way, I guess on the train, they were speaking to each other in Germ an.
 
And that was their language, of course, German so they're speaking with each other.
 
T hey could have spoken in Polishbut it was normalf or them  to speak in Germ an. So they 

were whispering, again. But som ebody overheard them . AndGermans were very unpopular 

f rom plenty of Belgians, so a mobformed.They were threatened.But they were rescued by a 

B e lgia n
 
--
 
T hey were on the verge of being lynched, right?
 
Possibly. I don't know what would have happened butfeelings ran pretty strong.
 
Somebody intervened.
 
Yes, a policem an rescued them . 
 
W hen did your parents
 
--
 
when did and your parents learn about thefate of  the rest of your 
fam ily, what had happened to the extendedfam ily? 
 

W ell, itdidn'thappen all at once.T hey didn'ttell m eeither, soI don't know. My aunt, the one 

who was in Belgium , cam e back. My uncle and cousin didn't com
e back f rom  Auschwitz. My 
aunt cam e back.
 
 
I was home alone. My parents had toldm e that I shouldn'tallow strangers in the 
house.T here was somebody rang the doorbell, so I opened the door and there was this 

wom an that I didn't know. She was strange looking. She had very short hair. She didn't say 

anything for a while. Ididn't know what to do. So I just stood there.And then she said, 
ﬁD
o
n 't  
you recognize m e?
ﬂ 
Itwas m y aunt. Shehad been in Auschwitz. So obviously I let her in.
 
T hat evening after we had dinner she talkedabout what happenedfrom  the tim e that they 

were arrested.
 
 
In them ovie theatersthey had shown news reels. Ithink in the 
S
tates as well. 
Anyway, we had seensom e shots of cam psbutnot with any kind of detail. My aunt went into 

great detail about what sheexperienced. I rem em ber a greatdealof  what she toldus. At som e 

point she showed usher tattoonum ber.W e kind of all leaned in to look. She said the worst 

things were the train rides inthe boxcars withoutfood and drink or toilet fordays with people 

dying on thetrain. And theother thing, in thecam p itself , was the roll call every m orning and 

ever y evening when everybody had to be accountedfor. And sometim es that took hours inthe 

sunshine, inthe heat,or in the winter in the snow. Andanybody who dropped orfainted was 

shoton the spot. 
 
 
In f act
,  
on the thirdf loor there's a large picture of  a roll call, inm ates lined up. If  you 
look carefully, you can see thatthere aretwo inm atesholding up a third onebetween them to

Althoughhelping Jews in any way was f orbiddenby the Germ an authorities, m any 
Belgians, including nuns, priests, and ordinary citi zens risked arrest, deportation to 

concentration cam psand eventheir lives by helping Jews in various wa ys like providing 

m oney, false I.D. cards, f ake ration couponsforf ood, andby hiding Jews, in particular 

children, f rom  the Gestapo and Belgian collaborates.
 
Conditions varied ineach occupied

survi val com pared to Holland where less
