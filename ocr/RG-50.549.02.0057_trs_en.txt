Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Blanka Rothsc
hild, conducted by Regina Baier on July 13
th
, 
1999, in Mrs. Rothschild™s home. This  is a follow-up interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview co
nducted with Blanka Ro
th schild on September 27
th
, 1994. 
The United States Holocaust 
Memo rial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and 
Toby Herr for making this inte
rview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So 
my first question to you is when were yo
u born and where, and give us your full 
name again. 
Answer: My full name is Blanka Irma Rothsc
hild. I was born in Poland, in Lódz, and 
-- August 19
th
, 1922.  
Q: And I would like to start with the time ju
st before liberation. If you could set for 
us the context a little bit, where were you, 
when was it, and what was your physical 
health and your state of mind at that time. It
™s a pretty heavy ques
tion, but if you just 
-- 
A: Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 
in so-called [indecipherable] which me ans in 
English, a sick bay. I was lying there with
 some broken ribs, which I received on the 
last beating that I got at the hands of th
e meister, the supervisor from the airplane 
factory in which I w -- slaved. And at that tim
e the allied forces were closing on the -

- around our city, Bittenberg. We were not re
ally sure who were they, but we were -- 
we were subjected to bombardments and th
e Germans closed us 
in the barrack, and 
the -- the doors were locked 
and the windows were covered,
 and we were not let out 
to work, and as well with the sick bay. Sinc
e this came so rapidly, they did not have 
time to dispose of us, because the plan wa
s to somehow eradicat
ed the camp with the 
inmates. I was brought from the sick bay to
 the main barrack wh
en they closed it. 
And the following day, or two 
days later, one of the girl s looked throug
h the window, 
the -- the shutter, and she have
 seen that the towers wher
e the German soldiers were 
usually with -- watching us, ar -- they we
re absent, nobody wa
s there. So they 
decided to  break the door ope
n and run. And the ones who c
ould, ran to the kitchen. 
They brought us some very 
silly foods, margarine, one 
egg, I think, a couple of 
potatoes and we stayed for awhile there. 
We had very mixed emotions because we 
didn™t know what to do. However, we decided 
that the safest thing for us would be to 
leave the camp, since it was abandoned by
 the Germans. This was the supposedly 
mo ment of the liberation, and we didn™t feel 
liberated yet. It was very strange feeling. 
We went across the street
, my friends helped me. 
Q: You couldn™t walk? 

A: I am -- I -- I walked, because I -- the human
 need to survive is so great that you 
summon all your energy to -- to
 survive. So I lived with 
this pain, and they helped 
me. And they -- as a matter of fact they sa
y, Blanka, another day,
 another day and we 

will be free. And we crossed the street. There was the house in which the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
4
commandant lived from the camp , with a gard
en, lovely flowers which I envied when  
I passed by and saw it. We went in side, it 
was abandoned as well. And there were, I 
think, seven of us, and one 
girl has -- had a mother with
 her yet. And they brought 
the food, and so mebody was preparing the fo
od, and all of a sudden the commandant 
came back with a gun, 
cocked the gun, aimed at the gr
oup of us and 
of course we 
were petrified, we thought that™s the end. 
And this big, strong man with the gun was 
afraid of us. And he backed out and disa
ppeared. At that moment we thought the 
safest thing would be to leave his hous
e and go to ward s the fire, because this 
indicated that whoever is 
fighting, is a liberato r. 
Q: How many of you at that time? 

A: I don™t know what happened, but we sp
lit. I was in a group of five. Two of the 
girls were helping me, and the five of us
 were running. We passed a field, it was 
street or a field, there were two young men 
there, and they joined us. These were two 
Polish men who wo rked  there during th e war 
as hands at the farms b ecause Germany 
needed laborers, and they jo
ined us. Since we were from 
Poland, we spoke Polish, so 
the seven of us reached the front line. 
Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first 
soldiers that we -- soldier th
at we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol 
maybe, with the eyes that ma ke seem that he™s Asiatic. 
And he was with the dirty 
unifo rm, filthy. And we kissed his boots. 
I rememb er that mo ment. And he motioned 
with his hands for us to go in
 the back. We went 
in the back, th
ey told us that we can 
help ourselves to food, which was in a ba
rrel, there were herrings. We ate some of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
5
the herrings, we got very sick from it becaus e the bodies were emp ty -- the stomachs, 
rather, were empty. And there was no waterbecause the pipes weren™t work ing. So -- 
but we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shap e. 

Q: So they were salt herrings, or [indecipherable] 
A: Long herrings, long herrings. And then they -- th
ey told us to l
eave. This was the 
front line after all, they were being shot an
d they shot back. So  we reached a house -- 
this was a village, finally, and we reached 
the very first house, which had a slightly 
damaged roof, I believe, and we went in. 
And it -- since the fighting go -- was going 

on, we decided to go to the basement. Th
ey had the basement, which was very, very 
well appointed. They had two so rt of cots
 to sleep, with -- w
ith linen on them, and 
they were -- the walls were 
lined with shelves, and the sh
elves had all sorts of jars 
with conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And 
in the other part of the basement there 
were barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, 
and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were 
some candles. So they were r
eally very well prepared. And of course we ate some of 
the stuff, and we lied down. And that baseme
nt was approachable by a swing door up 
and down, that™s all I remember, u p  and do
wn. And at some point during the night, 
the door swang open and tw o Russians came, 
and they  demanded girls. I believe that 
at least one of them was drunk, because he
 pulled up his gun and started to shoot at 
the jars. Now, I said to myse
lf, when I survived the five years, or over five years of 
war, and I™m still alive, I™m not going to be 
subjected to that, I™d rather die. So I ask 
one of the Polish boys to sa
ve me, and I said to him, 
look, tell them that I™m -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
6
pretend I™m your wife. I was lying on th is cot, and he covered me, and he sat down 
on top of me. And th e other girl did the sa
me, and one went in the back room wh ere 
the barrels were, and two girls were rape
d. No w th e -- the Russian who was shooting 
at the jars, was laughing like a child. To hi
m this was absolutely normal. Women and 
men were made to -- to mate. So there 
was nothing strange to him. He couldn™t 
understand that -- that we hated it, that we
 couldn't  understand it. I rememb er that the 
pieces of the broken jars, the glass, embe
dded in my left leg, and I still have the 
scars. And I didn™t ma ke a peep, not a sou
nd, because I wanted to
 survive, so I was 
quiet. On e of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I rememb er her, she 
was the youngest. She became hysterical a
nd she started  to scr
eam, so the Russian 
took a candle, put the light on -- lit the 
candle and brought her some water. And he 
put the compress, cold comp
ress on her forehead, he said
, okay. When the mo rning 
finally arrived -- 

Q: Had he rape -- had -- had he 
just raped -- I mean, after the -- 
A: Yes -- 
Q: -- rape, or before, or -- 
A: I he -- he raped -- one girl was raped on
 the floor, her name was Anya, she went to 
Israel, I don™t know too mu
ch ab out her now, and the other one was lying on the 
other cot, and it was dark, but we heard 
the sounds. And she was quiet. She was 
raped. She came from a very religious fam
ily, Jewish rel igious 
family, so in the 
morning she did not tell us that she was ra
ped, but we knew she was raped, because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
7
you -- you could hear the sounds. Extraord
inary. The next mo rning we decided to 
leave this place for something safer, and 
we walked through 
the village, found 
another house. They were -- all the hous
es were abandoned by the Germans who 
were running to ward s the Amer ican line, or English line. 
They did not want to be 
captured by the Russians. An
d the cows and the pigs we
re not fed so they were 
making sounds. We got into a house, we ma
de ourselves comfortable, we ate. The 
two boys went to the garden and th ey ch as
ed some chickens, we cooked the ch ickens. 
After we finished eating we took the tablecl
oth with the china an
d threw it out of the 
window. That was -- this was the little reveng
e. We didn™t want to wash the dishes, 
we didn™t know what will happen. It didn™
t feel like we are liberated. There was not 
the sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all,
 the war was still goi
ng on. We were so-
called liberated by the Russians, who became
 in our eyes, another oppressors. So I 
questioned my self, is -- was th
is worth it, all my suffering, 
to arrive at this moment? 
What™s going to be? What will happen la
ter on? And there was a story about -- I 
believe that I had on media tape, that we we
re so scared of the 
Russians that at night 
we took a ladder and we went to the attic, 
an d we slept in the attic, four of us. The 
two boys slept down stairs and one of the fi
ve girls, her name was Sarka, she found 
herself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a 
very enterprising young lady. The four of 
us were scared, four poor souls, so the f
our of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a 
bed, big, big bed, and the 
boys pulled the ladder down 
and we stayed up there at 
night. And the same night, we have hear
d German voices, and we thought that the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057

Germans came back. The Polish 
boys jump ed  out of the window. The house faced a 
small forest, a young forest, 
and evidently some of the so
ldiers who ran away, they 
were hiding. They were hungry,
 so they broke to 
this kitchen to eat. So the Polish 
boys jumped from the window
 because they were downst
airs, and they ran to the 
Russian commandantura to tell th em that th
e ru -- there are Germans in the house. 
And we hear the Russians coming, and we 
understand them because the Russian and 
Polish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the 
roots are sort of -- you could understand. 
They wanted to throw -- 
Q: Hand grenades? 
A: Hand grenades, and -- to the house. So th
e Polish boys said don™t, don™t, there are 
Polish girls upstairs. And we, a
ll four of us, crept undernea
th the big bed, we™re lying 
underneath the bed, and Blanka, the young
est one who -- who -- who was hysterical 
before, she wet herself and we 
were lying down there in th
e urine, not ev
en thinking 
about it. Here we survived 
the Nazi camp, here we are 
so-called liberated, here are 
the Germans downstairs and the Russians wa
nt to kill us. The -- the situation was 
absolutely unbelievable. The 
Germans tried to escape thro
ugh the kitchen door to the 
-- through the garden, 
and they  were shot by the Russi ans, both of them. And the two 
bodies were for two days lying there. After 
that day, my fear was so intense, that I 
did not want to stay with the girls. Th
e next house ha-h ad  French  prison -- ex-
prisoners of war, and I moved with them, they
 said they would take care of me, and 
they did.

Q: Through all of this
 you had broken ribs -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and you were really ill, but -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- did you get any kind of -- of medical supplies, or -- 
A: No, the Russians gave me -- as we -- when we were there at first, when they gave 

us some food, they  gave me some bandages 
to wrap myself, that™s
 all. I d -- I really 
don™t know how these people fought, because 
they were -- they di
dn™t change their 
unifo rms, they were dirty, they had all so
rts of food that was unthinkable, and they 
were fighting. They were very strong 
people, the -- the -- the stock. And the 
conditions were just tragic. I 
stayed with the Fr
ench people, who took care of me. As 
a matter of fact, I have pictures. They -- 
they  gave me some pictures. And one of 

them wanted me to go with him to France. He
 said, we will -- we will cure you there. 
And we stayed there fo r quite awhile, I 
don™t reme mb er the dates and how lo ng. But 
then the war was over on May sixth. We still 
stayed, because we didn™t know what to 
do and where to go.  

Q: How did you hear ab out that? 

A: Well, the Russians. Hitler kaput, Hitler 
kaput. It™s over. Sarka had this Russian 
lieutenant, or I don™t know wh at his rank 
was, she was very happy, and the th ree of 
them with the two Polish boys
 were still in that house. I 
was with the French people. 
I was absolutely scared
 out of my wits.

Q: [indecipherable] I will in
terrupt for just one second
. So now we are continuing 
again. So you were really scared. 
A: Yes. After I don™t rememb er how many weeks, but few weeks, people started to 

think of going back to  thei
r native countries. Now at that point, I did not know th at 
my family didn™t surv
iv e, that not one of them surv
ived. So I thought that my ob -- 
first obligation was to go back
 to look for 
my family.  
Q: We should -- I™m -- 
I™m sorry to interrupt. 
A: Yes? 
Q: We should probably say 
for the listeners who have no
t seen the videotape that 
your father had already died befo re the war. 
A: Yes. 
Q: But your mother and -- 
A: Grandmother. 

Q: -- your grandmother -- 

A: Well, my grandmother was taken away. I 
did not know if peop
le who were taken 
away were all dead. We tho
ught maybe some of them surv
ive. And my mother was -- 
you know, when  they  parted 
us, I thought maybe she surv
ived. So I th
ought that I 
have to fulfill my -- my first obligation 
and go back. And there were people from 
Poland who walked with little carts and Po
lish flags, towards Poland. And I decided 
that I will join them. There were carts, 
so I had some rides for awhile. And after 
tearful good-byes with the French people, 
that I will never forget, I left. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
11
walked, and walked , and th en they  had the 
horse once. So the ho
rse pull -- pulled the 
cart and I was in it. We reached a city ca
lled Lignitsa, which 
used to belo ng to 
German and became Polish, so I don™t rememb
er what the name was previous to it. 
Lignitz? 
Q: Lignitz. 
A: Lignitz, probably. It was not too far fro
m Breslau, and Breslau became Brotswow. 
And in Brotswow people al
ready had ap artments, people who surviv ed. Now, I was 
never very  enterprising, so I just depende
d on that man who was walking. And we 
stayed in Lignitz -- Lignitsa fo
r a couple of days, then we 
continued, and then  we had 
part of the trip was done by a train that  the trucks still remained somewhere. And 

eventually I reached Warsaw.  
Q: How did you eat, and wh ere did 
you get clothes [indecipherable] 
A: Who needed clothes? Who th ought of 
clothes? I had something from the German 
house. I -- I™m sorry to -- til today that I didn™t bring with me -- didn™t -- I didn™t 

think of preserving an ything from the camp , I 
just want to get rid of it. So I went 
through -- through the closets with my frien
ds, and I remember that I wore, I think it 
was a man™s shirt, blue, long-sleeve shirt, and some sort of a skirt. Some people were 

looking for watches, for thi 
-- I -- I didn™t think about it.
 I just wanted to see my 
family. When we reached Wa
rsaw, which was bombed to ru
bble, and they left me 
there, I didn™t know what to
 do, how to reach my city, L
ódz. I have no money, I have 
no possessions, I -- I™m -- you see me, that™s
 how I am. And there was a truck, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
12
Polish man who had a sign he™s 
going to Lódz. So I ask him if he could take me. And 
I said I have no money. He said okay. Th
ese times were different. People had some 
sort of -- I don™t know, not obligation, bu
t they felt like helpin
g one another, because 
the survivors were streaming back. So this 
man ow -- took me to his truck, and the 
funny part of it is that he stopped in one city
 and he left the truck 
to go to eat, and he 
didn™t think that I -- of me, that I™m hungr
y. Which -- which was sil -- really silly. 
Q: So you didn™t eat? 
A: I didn™t eat. I don™t reme mb er -- you see, certain things are faded in my  memory 
because they are not of majo
r imp o rtance. We eventually 
reached Lódz. We -- he let 
me out on a street, after all,
 this is my city, and Lódz
 was not really destroyed, 
because ra -- Lódz was occupied after fe
w days. It™s not too far from the German 
border, so it was occupied pre
tty mu ch untouched. Few build
ings I think we lost, and 
I knew my way around. So I went to m -- he 
-- he dropped me off in my  vicinity on 
the -- the house that I lived 
in, the Dineska, 31A, still st
ood, very nice house, four 
story house, a corner. And I went in and th
ere was the superintendent who work s for 
us, because the building belong
ed to my family. And he cr
ossed himself when he saw 
me. His greeting to me was surprise, and 
why did I return, how did I survive, and 
why did I come back? He said, you can™t go
 upstairs because people live there, and 
the Germans took ev erything out 
of your place, everything.
 Carpets, and -- there is 
nothing left. But I said I w -- I still wo
uld like to go -- did somebody come back? 
Anybody came here? He said 
nobody did. But I still walk
ed to my apartment and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
13
rang the bell, and they wouldn™t let me in
, the people who lived there. You see, 
Polish people were not really 
very friendly, and this is 
mi -- putting mildly. I went 
down stairs and the st -- intendent -- the supe
rintendent of the building to ld me that 
two blocks away, or three blocks away, th
ere was a office by Jewish -- I don™t know 
if this was HIAS, Jewish committee set up 
an office, and there were lists of people 
who came back, or who inquire
d, or who surv ived , and that™s where I went. And 
when  I s-scanned the list, I didn™t see any na
mes from my family, any at all, but I saw 
a name of my  school girlfriend, and her ad
dress, which was not too far. And I went to 
her apartment. She lived with her husba
nd, she was very  happy to see me . She 
survived with her husband,
 she got married in ghetto. 
And wh en ghetto was being 
liquidated completely, after the great liqui
dations, there were two groups left. One 
group that I was with my mo
ther in the hospital in on 
Wargevnitska. And the second 
group of 500 people, I believe, on Iyakuba in
 hiding. This is the only group that did 
not leave fa -- Lódz, and survived in hiding
 because the Russians came to Poland ju st 
in time. We were taken at th
e last  mo men t, in  Nov emb er. 
Q: How did you -- how did you feel, t
hough, when  you see no names from your 
family? 

A: [indecipherable] The emptiness, and th
e futility of survival
. The futility of the 
years of wishing and wanting and yearning to
 see somebody, to -- to live again, to -- 
the life was very bleak, that I had -- my fee
lin gs were that it wasn 't  worth survival. I 
didn™t know why I was chosen 
to survive. You mu
st know that at that time I w as not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
14
well, I had bandages on me, I had no mone
y, I had no possessions. I went to my  
friend, I had some tapes put around me
. You would be surprised how you can 
survive, how strong we are.
 The circumstances are just 
unbelievable. M-My friend at 
this time, with her husband, were already 
in a very nice apartm
ent, and they lived 
some sort of normalized life. He was occ
upied with some enterprise, earning money, 
and I didn™t feel very much wanted, since 
I did not have any fa
mily left, and Polish 
people did not greet me very 
nicely. And I remember distin
ctly my bitterness that my 
Polish girlfriends did not come to see me  wh
en I went to ghetto, 
not one of them. My 
dear friends from school, of all these years. 
I decided to  leave Poland. We have heard 
of displaced person camps in Germany, pe
ople who su rvived wi -- camps. And there 
was another girl who survived as well, a
nd I knew her, and th e two of us decided to 
leave Poland and go
 to the camps.  
Q: This would probably be a 
good place to change, to stop -- 
A: Okay .

anka Rothschild. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. This
 is tape numb er one, side
 B. Before we go on to 

Germany th en, let me ask you this, how -- wh
at got you through all of this? How do 

you think you -- you surviv ed? Wa
s there anything in  particular? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
15
A: I -- I ask  myself that question many, ma
ny times, because it is -- it seems to me 
improbable now. Ho w did I cope with the 
situation? How did I survive, and why it 
was me. It was combin
ed with a sense of 
deep guilt that I was 
the onewho survived. 
Why I? I didn™t feel worth it. There were pe
ople who were better in
 my family than I, 
and they  didn™t surv ive. They were youn
ger, and some older. Ho w did I go -- how 
did I have this burst of ener
gy to proceed to l
eave Poland, to thi
nk about it? Maybe it 
was the -- the deep sense of bitterness towa
rds people that I knew before the war who 
betrayed me, because I thou
ght this was betrayal. These were people who were 
coming to my  home, sleeping an d eating, an
d I was helping them with work. I was 
fairly good student. And they
 did not know me when th
e war started. So leaving 
Poland was not as traumatic
 because there was nothing th at I was leaving behind.  
Q: How did you leave, what [indecipherable] 
A: That™s -- th-th -- these are amazing stor
ies. You know, my -- my
 -- my -- my life 
is a -- like a kaleidoscope of different mo
ments that collectively saved me. And it -- 
they came in the -- just the 
right mo ment. When I decide
d to leave with my friend 
Irka, her name was Irk a, and strangely enough  we shared the last name. We were not 

-- we were not related, but 
we were both Fisher. We deci
ded to leave Poland and my 
friend, in whose home I was staying, said 
to me, you know, I™ll give you a couple of 
zlotys, which was the Polish money, very little
, and she gave me two bottle of vodka. 
She said, this is a very g
ood trading mark with the Ru
ssians, if you need it. And it 
proved to be true. We were not both
ered by any lu ggag e because we had no

16
possessions, neither one of us. Can you imag
ine this? I still wonder
 about it. The two 
of us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine
 -- Polish Posnine, 
Posen in German, a 
university city which was on -- near the borde
r, and we wanted to board a train which 
was going to  Germany. Now ho
w do you board the train when
 you have no money or 
anything? Just so happened on th is station,
 there -- there were -- the whole Russian 
contingent of soldiers were sitting arou
nd waiting for this train. And Irka and I 
decided to  find one of the Ru ssians, maybe he
™s Jewish, so he would help us. So  we 
said to -- how do you find the Jew? How 
does Jew look like? Wha -- wa -- how we 
can judge? We have to -- to
 chance. Or maybe we™ll find somebody who is decent 
enough to help us. And we still have thes
e vodka, covered of course, because the 
Russians and vodka, it™s -- we
 w alked -- they were making remarks as we were 
passing by, and we saw one tall individual 
in very  long coat, reaching his ankles, 
with a very prominent nose. And we said, 
do you think he might be Jewish? He was 
an officer, he had some insignia. And we 
approach ed him, and 
we asked -- we knew 
the few words in Russian, Ve 
evrai means Je w in Russian. Ve
 evrai, and he said da. 
Oh, that was first relief. We are little Polis
h, little Russian, we are two girls that are 
Jewish, the families were kille
d. We have nobody. We want 
to leave Poland to go to 
displaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to hi
s compartment, took 
his filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in
 the corner, and covered us with this -- 
hanged th is on a hook and covered us with  th
is stinky coat, and he said, don™t make a 
sound. And when  the train started, he gave 
us some bread. He was very ni -- he -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
17
gave him the vodka, we were so delighted. A
nd he said he was a dentist, and he said 
to us, don™t go east, go west. And he said if
 he would have his wi
fe, which was in one 
of the Russian cities [ind
ecipherable] he wouldn™t go
 back either. It -- it™s 
unbelievable this -- the situations that I wa
s involved with, the people that I me t, the 
people that did help me, that
 -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s a story after story after 
story. And we reached Berlin after -- afte
r stopping th -- at the border where we 
heard screaming because some women were
 being raped. I s
uppose German woman 
were being raped by the Russians, and we 
were still under that coat, and we reached 
Berlin station, we got off, we thank him. 
We found tw o men that 
looked to us Jewish, 
and they  were, and they  gave -- put us on 
the bus, they paid the 
fare, they told us 
when to get off. Now, both of
 us spoke German. We got 
off and that was the first 
Schlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at. 

Q: And how did it go from there then, and 
so -- who -- who -- do
 you know who was 
ministering that camp? 

A: I have no idea who was in
 charge, because I -- I was n o
t too long in that place. I 
don™t want to sound snobbish, but it was diffi
cult for me to get us
ed to it. They did 
give us a place to sleep  and 
they did give us food, but 
we, both of us 
felt we would 
like to -- and they helped us
 to -- to get a room by a German family , the first o n e, 
Frau Beans, I think, I don™t remember, a 
war widow with a son an d with her aunt. 
And we got a room there by her. It was 
not too far from Alexanderplatz in the 

Russian sector. We had some money, some
 ration cards. We lived like the Germans, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
18
on a ration card at that time. 
It was still unbelievable that we surviv ed to this point. I 
did not have any joy of my
 freedom, because it was not the freedom that I was 
longing for.  
Q: What would that freedom have been? Your family? 
A: My freedom would be, in my childish 
thinking, my  freedom wo uld be to be 
reunited with my family, and living a -- a nor
mal life. N o rmal meant to me to be the 
cultural life. Something that I -- that I thir
st for, I had hunger for it. That™s why Irka 
and I, wh en we have this room, decided to 
go to a movie one day,
 because we wanted 
to start some sort of normal life. A nd 
we went to the movie, which was German 
movie with Marie Carruk, I remember. I re
member -- I don™t remember the name of 
it, but I remember Marie Carruk, I don™
t know why. And once it was dark and th e 
movie was running, and we wh ispered to 
each other and all of a sudden we felt both 
us hands on our shoulders [indecipherable] and the Ru ssians took us out of th e o -- 

movie house. And we -- we c
ouldn™t understand, we were 
absolutely stunned. Well, 
we spoke Polish to each other, so we were
 spies. Spiong. Crazy, crazy idea. Didn™t 
we go through enough? They took us 
to a si -- a sta tion, Russian station 
commandantura, sort of, and th ey  had so 
many people they were get -- catching on 

streets, people, Germans, that they open
ed that -- I remember a large wrought iron 
gates. They opened and they pushed us in 
and it was full of people that they caught 

from streets. You know, 
they were sending them to Sibe
ria. And th e two of us were 
there too. Just so happened that that very 
day, Irka had a very ba
d toothache, and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
19
went to a dentist that the Jewish committ
ee paid for, and he pulled her tooth. And it 
started to hurt her, and she started  to cry. An
d she kept crying and they started to yell 
at her, they were annoyed that she was cryi
ng. And finally they we
re so annoyed that 
they open ed  the gate and th rew us out. This
 is another mo ment that saved us, because 
we would have been sent with the rest 
of the people, God knows where. Once we 
were thrown out, and went back to our room
, the very next day I said to her, I™m not 
going to st -- there were sectors, A merican
, British, French and Russian. We were in 

the Russian sector. Schlactensee was in the 
Russian sect or. I said
, I™m going to go to  
American sector, or English, or -- anything
 but. Now, th-the -- the [indecipherable] 
that -- that train was going around Berlin to a
ll the sectors. It -- at th at time it w as not 
close, you could get on and get off. So
 how do you go -- ev
erybody had to be 
registered. You know, the German red tape, 
you have to  be registered with polisi -- 

police. So what do we do? We were ge
tting ration cards, certain rations from the 
American relief organization, Jewish. There was a rabbi, with a -- 

Q: Joint? 
A: Joint -- Joint Distribution, that™s it, Jo
int Distribution. So  we had some coffee and 
cigarettes. Now, to have co
ffee in Germany, you don™t ne
ed diamonds after the war, 
coffee was it. So our brains st
arted to work, with this coffe
e, maybe they can register 
us in American sector. I can get rid of the 
co ffee, anything just to get out from this 
terrible situ ation. And we left
, we went to a police statio
n in the American sector -- 
unbelievable, is -- isn™t it?
 It -- it™s -- it -- it™s like -- like make- up story. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
20
talked to the German who was in charge, an
d I said, if you put our
 names there, here 
is the coffee, we just want to be in Amer
ican sector. He unders
tood because he also 
liked to be in American sector. He took th
e coffee, he put two -- two cards with our 
names and registered us, and we never put a foot in th e Ru ssian sector again. We -- 
no, Irka got herself some friend. Irka was a 
flirt, she was very pretty. I was alw ays 
scared. I was always scared. So I applied 
an d asked, and -- I don™t rememb er this was 
this was this German [indecipherable] of po
lice that assigned me th
at -- to that room. 
No, there was another camp , I was in anothe
r camp. That was Schlactensee, defin -- I 
-- I™m mixing up. The first ca
mp that I was was on Oranie
nbergerstrasse in the ru -- 
Russian sector. 
Q: That was the Russian sector.  
A: That was the rush -- 
Q: Schlactensee was the American -- 

A: Schlacten -- Schlactensee -- you see, I mi
x  -- I™m sorry. Oranienbergerstrasse was 

the first one, that was Russian
 sector. Then we went to 
Schlactensee, which was in 
American sector. I™m sorry, it™
s so many years. And we were
 in Schlactensee, and we 
were assigned places of course, and -- and I was there for awhile, and I didn™t like it. 

I just didn™t like it. I don™t want to go in to de
tails, I just wanted to leave. I wanted  to 
live a little bit more normal. People were 
occupied doing things, going pl -- pl -- 
driving, making money. I-I was a lost
 soul, I didn't  want to have -- 
Q: Sort of black market
 activity [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
21
A: Sort of, yes. The exchanging stuff. Th
ey were going to Breslau and back, to 
Brotswow. I was never that enterprising. So a
ll I wanted is to have a -- a private room 
somewhere and -- and be left alone. And I we
nt to the American 
Je wish chaplain and 
there was some sergeant there who ask me if 
I have relatives in the United States. So 
I said, all I know is that my
 maternal grandmother had a 
sister and half a brother. 
And the sister lived in Detroit. So I gave
 him the name that I remembered, because I 
had really nothing to  do with th em, and th
eir name was Polsonsky,
 that™s all I knew. 
And we received the ration cards and Irka go
t herself a -- a -- a gentleman. And I was 
given the room by Frau  Pegello
 on Tanaustrasseact sane. Yes. 
Q: You still remember that. 
A: I still remember th at. And there was a ni
ce room, and I stayed there, and from 
time to time I was going to this Joint Dist
ribution, getting my ration there. I still had 
tough times. I still didn™t feel that this is
 the freedom that I lo
nged for, and I said 
what -- what life holds for me again? Wh-W
hat I™m gonna do? I didn™t want to stay 
in Germany. I didn™t want to stay in a 
country that I suffered, and that killed my 
family. I didn™t want to live in Poland beca
use this was a country that I grew up, 
country that I loved, country that -- whose 
language and literature and music I loved, 
and where people with whom I grew up didn
™t want me, so I didn™t want them. The 
idea of going -- at this time there was no Isra
el or Palestine, wo
uldn™t apply to me 
because I was too sick, I was not capable 
of any work. And Am
erica was the only 
solution. About six months later I received
 a letter from the Join
t Distribution, th ey 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
22
located my family in Detr
oit. Family that changed 
the name, from P o lsonsky to 
Souls.  
Q: That™s amazing. 

A: It™s amazing. You see, as I said  collec
tively, all these little th
ings, like beads in the 
necklace, one was next and 
next and next. Evidently, wh
en I have bad times, and 
doubts, why -- why did I surviv e, and all 
this [indecipherable] they say, well you 
were meant to survive and there was a 
purpose to -- to keep you alive. You 

propagate, you have a lovely daughter, a
nd you have a wonde
rful grandchild. You 
have now small family, but it™s your own. I 
carved myself a niche 
in this liv -- living 
here. And -- 

Q: We™ll talk about that some
 more, in more detail a little 
later. So how did you get to 
America th en? 

A: Well, they -- I had to wait 
for my turn for th
e visa to -- to this family. And the 
family, the half-broth er of my  grandmothe
r lived in New Jersey. And his s-sons-in-
law were attorney s. One was even prom
inent in Republican party. A water 
commissioner from New Jersey. 
So they  speeded up th e proc
ess of -- to obtain visa 
for me. And I was awaiting that result in 
this apartment, Frau Pegello, who after 
awhile warmed up to me, and wasn™t afraid 
of me any mo re, and 
Frau Pegello always 
told me, Fraulein Fisher, Miss Fisher, I am an
 old lady, I™m over 90, I have seen a lot. 
I was a Naz i and all my neighbors were 
Nazis. And now nobody was Nazi, only I. 
Well -- well, we ended up as sort of friends. 
I said, I want you to learn about me, who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
23
I am, and -- and we -- we parted on friendl
y terms. And I awaited that visa and the 
visa came through, and I arrive
d -- well, before I arrived, I went to -- wh-which port 
was it that I sailed from? Not Hamburg, I don™t rememb er. 
Q: Bremerhaven? Bremer -- 
A: Bremerhaven, I think. I think Bremer
haven. On Marine Marlin, which was an 
army transporter, used to transport the ar
my  back and forth. And this was another 
piece of injustice that I suffered, becausewe, the people who were -- some survivors 
that were booked on this 
line were put in the very bo
ttom of the boat, and the top 
were reserved for the German
 war brides. So we were ag
ain noth ing down  there. To 
top this off, we s -- we sailed in December 
of ™46, and we encounter a horrible storm. 
We lost part of the bow, and we were 16 
days on the ocean. Ev
erybody, including the 
crew, was deathly sick. We were throwing
 up our guts, nobody
 could eat. And we 
were wondering if -- why did we survive to 
die in the middle of the ocean? And that 
was the trip. So -- and it was a gehanah. 

Q: And then  you saw New York, though? 
A: I arrived in New York, and we were 
pointed to benches, long benches, above 
which there were alphabet na -- letters, A, B,
 C, your last name. Mine was F, Fisher, 
so I was directed to F to sit, and I was sitting there. 

Q: Was that Ellis Island, or was that [indecipherable] 
A: No, no pier. No Ellis Island, pier. I 
don™t remember w h ich one, but pier. And I 
was sitting there, and people were comi
ng and picking up the -- the newcomers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
24
Nobody was coming for me, and 
I know that my family sp
onsored me and knew that 
I was coming. I was sitting there, almost th
e last one, and finally I saw a gentleman 
walking by waving a photo. A
nd th e photo was of my  grandmother. And I said to 
him, my  grand -- in Polish, and he didn™t 
speak Polish. I said, speak German? No, he 
doesn ™t speak, he only speaks English, Am
erican [indecipherable] only English. No 
Polish, no German, no Russian
, no French, English. But 
he picked  me out by hand 
and we walked out an d there at the outside 
door stood an elderly 
gentleman with gray  
hair -- white, snow white hair with pink ch
eeks and blue eyes and I knew that™s my  
family because he looked like my grandm
other, and that was her half brother. And 
this was his son-in-law who pick ed me up,
 he -- this was the lawyer. Now the story 
was that I was supposed to go
 to my  grandmother™s sister 
in Detroit. What happened 
was that it took our ship 
to sail for so many days that the elderly lady who so  
anxiously aw aited my  arrival, died just pr
ior to the boat docki
ng in New York. And 
the family from Detroit let know the family 
in New Jersey that I am arriving on this 
ship and somebody should pick  me up because 
they are her funeral. Story. And th ey 
took me to their place in New Jersey, and 
m-my great-uncle™s wife spoke Polish and 
German, and was -- this was the first moment
 that I had some warmth, that -- this 
older lady, whom I loved.  

Q: Did you see your mo ther again? 
A: I have seen my mother after the war. 
In Germany. When I survived and I went 
back to Poland, and I went back  to Germ
any, my  -- I don™t rememb er these things. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
25
was trying to  locate my  mo ther because when  
they parted us, they
 said that she was 
going to  -- not [indecipherable] some place, 
different place, that there was a group of 
-- from our group was taken there. And I was 
supposed to be with them, but the -- the 
young ones like myself were 
taken to this Bittenburg to 
work in Arando, and they 
separated us. And my mother was in Strusse
n, so she went there, where we were 
supposed to be, by this Ge
rman, I think his name was Zi
fer, who said you will be my 
group. Sort of like a Schindler. And I -- when
 I came -- l-left Poland, a-and came to 
Germany first, I was s-searching fo
r her. And she was in Oranienberg -- 
Oranienberg-Sachsenhause
n hospit -- but she died
. She was completely -- 
Q: But you saw he
r one last time? 
A: I -- I saw her. I don™t even want to th
ink about it because th-that™s a terrible 
memory, so I -- certain thin
gs I try to erase from my 
memory. Subconsciously I™m 
erasing things from my memory. I don™t want
 to see -- I d on™t remember the face of 
my tormentor who crippled me. I don™t reme
mber the face of th
e SS offzeering for 
whom I knitted the sweater. I don™t -- don™t wa
nt to rememb er the face of th-the 
people wh o, on our appelleplatz, the man 
who sends the dog to 
rip me apart. You 
know the story? That™s amazing, 
this story, with this dog. 
Q: Yeah, you -- you told that story in th
e videotaped in terview, the dog did not -- 
A: The dog did -- 
Q: -- harm you, he licked your face. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
26
A: -- he licks my face. The dog brought me
 to my consciousness, and the German let 
me live because the dog, the dog had some 
sort of understanding that I™m a dog lover, 
you know, there is some connection there.
 And something human woke up in  him. 
He said, the dog let her live, I will let her live. 
Q: S o  so me memo rie s are sa
fer buried for you than -- 
A: Some memo ries are -- I pushed away. So metimes I don™t rememb er I™ve seen my  
mo ther, I don™t remember her face or anything, I don™t, I don™t. 

Q: Let™s go ahead -- 
A: It™s the guilt, the guilt th
at I survived. I just though
t I wasn™t worth it. I had a 
cousin i -- my family was very modern, ev
erybody had one or tw
o children, period. 
And my  cousin who was the only child, his 
name was Nicoden Pishen. He left the 
ghetto, smuggled  himself. Spoke German -- a
ll of us spoke Germ
an. And he decided 
he™s not going to  stay, he™s young, he™s
 strong, and he speaks the language, he 
wanted to  surviv e. He smuggled hims
elf out the yudas -- the -- the -- the -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- stars -- the stars, and he went thro
ugh Germany, and my aunt received -- you 
see how strange of the German -- the order, th
ey killed, and yet th
ey were orderly in 
keeping the data. They sent her a postcar
d to ghetto. Your son Nico den died of 

longensindong, of -- 
Q: Pneumonia? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
27
A: -- of pneumonia. He was 16, I think, 
struck on the Swiss bor
der. The Swiss must 
have turn ed him back or -- or he was caught
 just prior to -- I -- I pretty mu ch think 
that they turned him 
back, and he was killed. So here
 they were killing people, and 
here they sent her a postcard, which maybe 
she would have lived for the hope that he 
survived. So -- 
Q: We should -- we should st
op here, this is the end of 
tape one, side B, interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. 

A: Okay .  
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
28
Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. This 
is tape numb er two, side A. So now you have arrived in 
New Jersey? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And how was -- I mean, where did you stay -- I guess, where did you stay, where 

did you live, but also how was it to be in 
America? What did you st -- was it strange? 
You didn™t speak an -- no -- any English yet? 
A: Well, I arrived in New Jersey because the 
family to whom I was 
supposed to go in 
Detroit, there the lady who was my grandm
other™s sister passed away, and they let 
the New Jersey part of the family know of 
my  arrival. I was picked up at the pier, and 
I stayed with them, since Detroit was busy 
with the funeral and the mourning period. 
I stayed for couple 
of weeks in New Jersey, and I de
veloped a very warm friendship 
with the great-uncle, and his wife, who 
was an elder -- elderly, charming lady, 
speaking few languages, and sh
e endeared herself to me , be
cause she made me feel at 
home. It was warm, it was not anything mate
rial that I needed, 
I needed -- I needed 
love and affection, and that™s what she ga
ve me. But after couple of weeks they sent 
for me to go to Detroit. They put me on a 
train in a very beautiful, luxurious car. I 
was sitting with the chair facing the window,turn around chair, I 
remember, an d they 
gave the porter extra money to take care 
of me because I couldn™t speak the language, 
to bring me food and so forth. And it was 
a long trip, and when the train arrived in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
29
Detroit, a whole group of people ar -- were 
awaiting me. Now, at this time, I forgot to 
mention that when I was leaving Germany,
 I was still having some ration from the 
Joint. I had some coffee, cigarettes, and I 
never smoked. So I decided to change this 
for some decent clothes. So I received fo
r my cigarettes [indeci
pherable] some fur 
coat. Some -- I -- [indecipherable] I-I think it 
was, and a nice hat, and I looked -- I 
wanted to look presentable wh
en I was arriving. So when I 
arrived in Detroit in this 
coat, and white gloves, and I looked -- I s
uppose I was already nourished because in -
- Joint gave us food, and in -- in New Je
rsey I was getting good fo od and care. So I 
came -- I -- I looked almo st human. They 
were all stunned. I don™t know wh at did 
they expect? Some spectacle? Somebody wh
-who is from beyond
 the moon? Who -- 
of course, I didn™t speak English, but here
 I looked like a lady. 
And they brought me 
home. The older lady and her 
husband were very nice an
d they sp oke some German, 
so there was some communicatio
n. But they had only daught
er who was, well, I must 
say she had two degrees from 
various universities, but th
at doesn™t make a person 
very bright, or very polite. 
And she made my  life miserabl
e. She resented me. I was 
the attention gatherin g point. 
My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady 
that died wanted to be very
 nice to me. She was very nice lady. Sh e was patroness of 
arts and mu sic, and I could communicate 
with her because I loved it. And her 
daughter resented every single thing th at I -- 
I did or said. They sent me to a night 
school to learn English. And this was a 
class composed  of elderly people who came 
here very early as -- I suppose i-in the 19
10 or 20™s. They worked all their liv es and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
30
now that they were retired they were -- wa
nted to learn the proper language. So  after 
a few weeks, the teach er said, my dear, this
 is not a class for you, because y-you will 
learn rapidly in a different class. And I st
opped going there. What I really wanted 
was to have a good medical care, but my  fam
ily, for some reason, did not take me to 
doctors. 
Q: Did you ask them to? 

A: No. I wouldn™t ask. 

Q: Did th ey know how -- 
A: They knew, but this was healed by this 
time. It was crooked, 
you can still touch it, 
how crooked it is, but I didn™t ask. I -- I ju
st -- I never partoo
k of anything that 
welfare had to offer, or my family had to o
ffer. I just wasn™t brought up this way. So, 
way -- since I was here, I did not bother with 
that aspect, and it wasn™t that noticeable 
at that time. And I -- I -- the family did not 
understand that I had 
pride, I didn™t want 
to be given few cents. I was 
walking without a penny in  
my pocket. Now, when -- I 
wanted to  work , I want
ed to earn some money. Now, 
they took me to a bakery  one 
day, and I was supposed to sell bread a
nd cu t bread, but eviden
tly I wasn™t fast 
enough, so after the whole day wo rk, they  
dismissed me  without pay. And I -- I came 
home and everyone said, you didn™t get paid
? You have to get pay an yway. I said, 
but they  didn™t like my  wo rk. 
So  I didn™t get any pay. So that was the end of th e 
bakery . But I still didn™t like being so dependant. I wanted  to -- my  independence. 
And I -- I was very unhappy with the daughte
r™s treatment of me, so I decided to get

a job on my  own. Now, Detroit has a larg
e Polish population, and I went to that 
Polish sector -- these are people who live he
re many years, but Polish is still the 
language of the house. I got my  serve -- so
rt of menial job wo rking on camera cases, 
on -- I don™t remember exactly, but I think it was -- 
Q: Don™t go quite so close 
to the microphone, just -- 
A: I -- I -- I think I was getting about 18 do
llars a week. I -- those days, I -- and my 
family -- so -called family was absolutely 
stunned. You don™t have to wo rk, you have 
bed, and you have food, and you
 have -- I want to be independent. I don™t want to ask 
for 10 cents, if I want ice cr
eam cone for instance, I just 
don™t want to. So I decided 
to save the money enough for a ticket to go
 back to New York, a
nd to the family in 
New Jersey that I loved, that old lady. 
Now, the old lady with her husband in New 
Jersey, who was my grandmother™s half-broth
er, they were retired
 people in not too 
great financial situation. Their children we
re quite well off, but 
they lived a very 
nice, middle income group. And I got my se
lf -- they accepted me with open arms, 
and I got myself -- I w ent to nursing class.
 By that time I was already rapidly learning 
the language, reading, going to  movies, pick
ing up quickly. And I -- I couldn™t go for 
three years, so I went for a short course in
 private -- private nursing to take care of 
newborn infants. I loved babi
es, and I didn™t have to sp
eak to them. And I got my 
diploma, and my  very  first job that I had was with the doctor from the family who 
recommended me to another doctor, they ha
d new baby. And I became part of their 
family, they -- they were just -- till today.
 Till today I am in touch with them. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
32
my very first pay I gave to my aunt, and 
I said, now I™m independen t, I can pay. And 
it was a wonderful feeling. But the -- the freedom had a fringe always, of guilt. The 
survivor guilt. And I -- I was not the very 
happy person that I was before the war. 
Q: Could you -- could 
you talk to anybody about your
 experience? Did anybody ask 
you, did they want to  know how was --  

A: Well, people knew  that bad th ings ha
ppened to me, but th
ey thought that by 
avoiding the subject they did not make me 
feel bad going back  to it. And I thought 
maybe even for therapeutic r
easons I should have talked 
about it, and I did not start 
my talking until quite late. It developed as
 my own project and it grew by word of 
mouth. 

Q: Your public speaking, 
but not [indecipherable] 
A: My public speaking. 

Q: -- private, too. 

A: In priv ate, well we mentioned things. 
They  knew ab out my  back being scarred, 
and the ribs crooked here, and about fam
ily, yes, everybody™s gone, and ev erybody™s 
killed. Oh, that™s just terrible, let™s not talk
 about it. They though
t that they did me a 
favor not to go back into it.  But I felt that since we were getting on, getting a little 

older, and older, and something has to be sa
id, something has to be aired. And when  
the museum came into being,
 this was for me a -- a tremendous step. But by that time 

I was speaking already on my  own.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
33
Q: Yeah, well, we™ll g et back to that a 
little later. So you were
 -- you now had to 
work , and you felt independent. 
A: I felt independent. 

Q: Did you make friends? 
A: I made friends m-m-mainly were in the 
cla ss, the nursing class that I was. I was a 
large group of people and I made some fri
ends, I was invited fo
r Christma s holiday, 
for the Christmas tree and so  forth, and we
 became friends, yes. And the people for 
whom I worked, I was always very fortunate,
 I -- I worked for people who treated me 
as a member of a family, as an equal. No
t like that cousin™s daughter who made me 
feel very inferior, and th-that™s what I said
, you don™t need the college degrees to be 
absolutely a -- a miserable, evil person.
 Knowing intelligencefrom book doesn™t 
make you a whole person.  
Q: Did you take -- take part in -- in Jewi
sh -- in the Jewish community and activities -
- 

A: Not -- no, not in the beginning, no. I am 
not really very religious person. It would 
be very difficult, even if I would have been
, to continue being very rely -- religious. 
As I said in my tape, some people lost 
their faith completely, and some people died 
with the name of God on th eir lips. So my  
family, my father and my mother were no 
-- were very free thinkers. They were not ve
ry observant. My gr
andparents were. Th-

The older family. And we sp
ent holidays together, which 
the memories of this I 
treasure. That is the warmth, this is 
-- you ask me before what gave me the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
34
background, the strength. The strength, part 
of it, is due to the basic background of 
the person. Of the family, of the ethical, mo
ral upbringing of the behavior and of the 
sense of obligation to so ciety and to my self 
and I always said that, if people ask me 
about religion I said I -- I am not very 
organized in religion, but if I obey the 
commandments, I™m religious. It doesn™t have to have a label. I don™t do anything 
that they say don™t. And I -- and I do respec
t people and respected my  parents, and I 
didn™t steal and I -- thou shall not kill. Yes,  I am that kind of p -- th-therefore I am 

religious. So I never thought 
that I needed a house of wo
rship to make me religious. 
A human being can be religious, like my  father
 said, that God surrounds us in -- in 
the nature. When  you sit at a bank of the 
river, as I did with my father, and we 
watched the flow of the water, and the littleducks on it, and the flowers and trees, 
this -- this is part of my religion.  
Q: Did you want to have a fa
mily  at that time, and is 
that what you wanted your 
family to grow into, that kind of -- 

A: When I survived and came here, this was the uppermost thing in my mind. I 
wanted a ch ild so badly, because I felt that 
I owed this to my fa
mily. I wanted a child 
to show Hitler that I conquered him. And 
when my  granddaughter -- the strange part 
here is that I, my mother was not religi
ous, my father was not religious, I was not 

religious. My daughter is not 
religious, but she sent her 
daughter to Hebrew school, 
and her daughter had Bat Mitz
vah, which neither she, nor I, nor my  mo ther had. And 
I spoke at that Bat Mitzvah, and at one po
int I said, if I rememb er verbatim, that

some honorable people up there must be 
smiling today, because 
our seed survived 
after all. I addressed this to my grandda
ughter. She is -- she™s the one who is carrying 
on. So sometimes -- and wh en I was pregna
nt, when I wanted to get pregnant, my  
doctor said, this will be very bad for you, your back. It will thro w you off completely. 
I said, it™s worth it. I had 
to have a child. I wanted 
to get married because of 
[indecipherable] you just didn™t have a child
 without being married that -- those days. 
Q: Yeah, I was just about to say, before 
we get to your grandd
aughter, let™s get to 
your husband. 

A: Yes. Yes. 
Q: How did -- how did you -- ho
w did you meet him, and is
 he -- is h e Jewish as 
well? 
A: My husband is Jewish. 
Q: Is he s -- a survivor, too? 

A: No, no. He was born in Ge
rmany, and his parents, a middle-class family, had six 
children, and in 1935 - six - seven, started 
to send the children out
, one by one out of 
Germany. And they  followed them in 1938. So
 this was wise, because if -- so me very 

wealthy people didn™t leave because nobo
dy could believe wh at
 would happen. I 
mean, it was just unthinkable. But they surv
ived because they were just middle class 
people, they sent one by one 
the children here. My husban
d arrived here as a boy, 
went to high school and hi
gh school, and started university in Rochester, but had a 
very tough time financially, and had to -- 
h e  w o rk ed  an
yway . And  I met my  mo th er-

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
36
in-law first, before I met my husband, as
 a -- as a nurse. And she was a dear, sw eet, 
wonderful lady, who she -- when she liv
ed in Brooklyn on a f -- low floor, the 
window was open and theres 
was sitting Frau Rochelle 
with cookies, and gave 
everybody cookies, and she was known in the whole neig
hborhood. And wh en she -- 
when I took care of -- took care of -- was 
it that child in the hos
pital? But I got to 
know her, and I visited her. And way -- she sa
id, I have a son, a very nice boy. And 
later when she talked 
to Harry over the phone, becaus
e Harry lived on the west coast, 
she said, she™s not only nice girl [speaks German here], 
she speaks German. That was 
to her -- because she didn™t speak English, 
so to her this was just wonderful. And I 
met my  husband, she went to west coast, he
r si -- her d aughter lived in Oregon, and 
they sent for me, just like 
that, and I started -- first I 
corresponded with him. And I 
met him and we went to Justice of 
Peace, I didn™t have any wedding.  
Q: So what did you like about him? 
A: I™ll tell you what I liked about him. 
I me t some people in 
New York th at were 
interested that I -- but I couldn™t -- I coul
dn™t find really what I would have done 
before the war. I was not that desirable eith
er, because I was not that well. I had to 
compromise somehow. I wanted
 somebody who™s nice, who has had some things that 
we shared, love for music, love for animal
s, love for nature. We are otherwise very 
different people. But I had to settle for ce
rtain things. My husb
and will like operas, I 
like classical music. My husband
 will read certain things, I 
love to read, I™m an avid 
reader. I enlarge my vocabular
y, English, by reading. I we
nt to community college to

37
better my self. I -- I -- under normal circum
stances, I suppose I would have gone on 
and on because, education. My
 husband, education is important to him, but he was 
not as fast in it, and he work ed, he made
 very mediocre living. I was happy. I mean, 
this was not the most important things. I 
wanted to create a home and atmo sphere 
into which I bring the child an
d teach her from the very early on, love for music, love 
for the word -- written 
word, and I succeeded. 
Q: Yes, you did. 

A: Yes, I succeeded. 
Q: When  was she born, and wh at™s her name?  
A: Her na -- 

Q: [indecipherable] a little bit about her. 
A: My daughter -- well, when it came to
 naming her, my  mo ther was Ann -- Anna -- 
Annemarie. So, Anna. My husband lost a sist
er in childbirth, her name was Rose, and 
I didn™t like Rose. So we -- we made Roch
elle Ann. And aftia -- after awhile we 
dropped the Ro because the kids in school
 teased her, roach. So it was Shell Ann. 
And now it™s Shelly. Now she™s Shelly. 
And she -- she has Master ™s degree in 
advanced English from England. Sh e wr
ites, and sh e work s for Santa Monica 
college, for the students. Her husband is from 
England, he™s an attorney. And Alexis 

-- Alexis wants to be -- 
Q: That™s your granddaughter? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
38
A: My granddaughter is Alex
is, Alexis Danielle. She wants to study environment law 
-- environment. She wants to save the world.  
Q: Good for her. We™ll get to her a little late
r, I still would like 
to stay with your 
daughter. 
A: Yes. 
Q: When  was she born, and wh at kind of
 parenting id eas did you have for her? 
A: Okay, she was born in March 22
nd
, 1951, and I have to sa
y that I was a little bit 
brainwashed being in United St
ates, by Dr. Salk. Dr. -- no, no, doctor -- not Dr. Salk. 
Q: Was -- was he the famous -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, the child -- 

Q: Oh, Dr. Spo -- 
A: Dr. Spock, Dr. Spock. I had his book, 
this was my  bible, because I didn™t know 
much about it. So I had Dr. Spock book, an
d I believed that the mo ther doesn™t work , 
mother has to be home, mother has to br
ing up the child. Well -- well, my financial 
situation was very precarious, we lived on 
a walk-up in the Bronx 
on the fourth floor, 
one bedroom, which I gave to my  child. We
 slept in the living room on a couch. I 
believed in the education. I was singing to
 her, reading to  her, and she had dancing 
classes. I -- I would have gone out without an
ything, but she had to  have things that I 
thought were important, and she -- she was 
taught she will be polite, she was taught 
proper manners. Well, she became American 
very soon, you know
, after the -- with 
school, and the peer pressure, you know, th
at -- she was fairly good student, not the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
39
best. She -- she did not try to achieve he
r potential, sometimes
 was lazy. But she 
developed very, very  good back ground cultu
rally. She is avid reader, she is av id 
theater-goer, she loves mu sic. And Alexis 
plays piano beauti -- my  daughter started 
to play piano but we gave up after I sa
w it was no use. It was no use. I had piano 
lessons and I wasn™t good either. So I must 
admit, I wasn™t good
. My -- my -- my two 
uncles were pianists, but I didn™t in-inherit th
is, and neither she did, did she? Alexis 
plays piano, but also she™s not a pianist. She plays piano. 
Q: How did she di -- how di
d you teach limits, though? 
A: A very, very difficult in United States, 
because she would say, her mo ther let her 
do this, or -- I said, well -- there was a saying in my house. She -- her best friend was 

brought up in a very free 
house, very free. At the age of nine, she could go 
[indecipherable] hang out, or go to a movie 
or something. And she said Annie can go. 
I said, you can™t go. So  she used to  -- she 
wanted to hurt me, sh
e didn™t know how. 
So she said, you™re such a continental mother. This was 
the wo rst she could come up 
with. I was a -- I said yes, that™s y our misfortune. I -- I set the limits on -- to a certain 
point. When -- Annie was brilliant, her best 
friend. No doubt about it, extremely high 
IQ. She went to Bronx High School of Science. My daughter didn™t, my  daughter 
went just to high school. She was permitte
d to -- to do things, some her own. Her 
teacher told her mother that she reached th
e top, they can™t teach her any more. Annie 
became some sort of a failure
 in life. They still commu nicat
e, they love one another, 
they -- when Annie used to co
me to my house -- we lived 
in the same building, too. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
40
When a -- she used to come to
 my house, or -- I insisted
 on open door. This was one 
of my -- because Annie I didn™t trust. An
nie™s smoking, and things -- what she was 
smoking. My daughter didn™t smoke. I said, 
I™m not going to sit and preach to  you 
that it™s bad for your health, but I said, lo
ok what™s happening to these people later 
on. You -- you have brain, 
use it. She never did.  
Q: You mean drugs? 
A: Drugs and th ings. Never did. Neither di
d Alexis, I™m very fortunate. Neither did 

my  son, you know. Well, he was brought up 
by very square people 
in England. So we 
were very lu cky there. I never pressed 
on her any strong belie
fs, she develop her 
own. You know, we had many arguments, a 
number of them, yes, because I tried to 

foolishly spare her some of the disappointme
nts in life. B u t eviden
tly you have to go 
through the experience yourself to learn. 
And I wanted to spare her the hard lessons. 

So sometimes it was backfiring. However, at
 the end she realized that maybe I was 
right after all. So -- 

Q: Did she ask you -- did you 
talk to her at a certain point about what happened to 
you? Did she -- when was -- 

A: I la -- I never made a secret of my pa
st, but she herself had -- her -- her love for 

me is so deep, so intense, 
that she did not want to know
 the details, til today. She 
cannot stand listening to  how th ey did it to me
, and wh at they did 
to me. For instance, 
they pulled my wisdom teet
h without anesthesia, learning. And at one point, and I 
don™t rememb er it was Ravensbrück, 
somebody pulled my  teeth, yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
41
Q: [inaudible] 
A: For instance, when we arrived in Ravens
brück, we were subjected to the medical 
exam. We had to be stripped naked in front 
of the men there and put on the chair with 
legs up, I never saw this. They were l
ooking fo r valuab les, and -- and they were 
laughing because we were virgins, few of 
us there. This -- it was very humiliating -- 
humiliating, degrading experience, that she w
ouldn™t want to hear, and sh e wanted to 
spare me, le -- don™t th ink about it. When 
I had bad dream, don™t -- get away from. 
Til today she cannot stand my -- she feels so
metime that I am too pessimistic, that I 
have bad mo ments, and she 
calls every night. Every si
ngle night. And no matter, 
even if we had argument, which we do, sh
e ends up with I love you. Because she 
once said, I never want to be sorry that I 
never said to my mo ther I love you when 
she was here. That some people say it™s too 
late, I should have told  my  mo ther this 
and this. We are friends as well as mother
 and daughter, and that is wonderful.  
Q: Yeah. I have to change 
the tape again. This -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. This 
is tape number two, side B.
 So we just talked about 
your daughter. 
A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
42
Q: And your very close relationship to her. It
 just occurred to me 
that in a sense that 
you have not recreated, but -- but cre -- cr
eated something close to the relationship 
that you had with your own mo ther, and 
your grandmother. And 
now you have very 
close relationship with your 
daughter, and it -- one child, you were one ch ild, too. It™s 
an interesting progression, and yo
ur grandchild is very close -- 
A: Very close. As matter of fact, she was he
re this weekend, spent with us, went with 
her Papa to the zoo, and here -- and Nana 
makes what she likes to eat, and we have 
be -- 
Q: Nana and -- 
A: Nana and Papa. 

Q: Nana, that™s you. 
A: Yes. Very, very close relationship. As
 -- my relation with 
my  mo th er was mo re 
formal than my daughter and myself. We 
are more friends. Wher
e with my mother 
there was a -- a -- some formality
, some respect, which here in the United States is a l 
-- sometimes a little absent. I 
sometimes w ouldn™t dare to 
approach my mother in a 
manner that my daughter will come to me. 
However, we very freel
y express the love 
for one another, and my  daughter calls me 
nightly , saying I love you, Mom. And I™ll 
say I love you, no matter how an gry I can be 
at her. So -- and this is the closeness. 
My mother-in-law -- my mothe
r, for instance, prior to th
e outbreak of the war, was 
being courted by a -- a physician, because 
my  dad passed away co
uple of years. And 
she tried to keep me still 
very, very  young. Sh e used to  come home in the evening, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
43
and she™d say, is the child asleep, and I 
was 14. So th -this didn™t happen with  my  
daughter and me. That -- that was a little bit different. 
Q: Well, that was a different age, and a different world -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- still, it is a very close -- 
A: Oh yes, very close fami -- 
yes, absolutely.This 
-- this is as -- as I said previously, 
this is my -- my solid back
ground that -- the basis that ga
ve me that push to surv ive 
and to live and to continue. 
Q: So how was survival in America, 
then? You continued to wo rk ? You had a 
daughter, what -- where -- where -- where are we? We are now in -- 
A: When I got married. 
Q: Yeah, but when did you get married? 
A: December 22
nd
, 1949. 
Q: In ™49. 

A: It™s going to be 50 years this 
December. And we got married on the 22
nd
 of 
December because he had day off on Christma
s, and we had no money, so there was 
very -- just right. I remember a small, little 
detail, we went to th
e store to look for a 
wedding band, and th e clerk said which on
e would you like, and 
I said, I would like 
the cheapest. Yes, becaus
e it didn™t matter to me. 
Q: It™s -- it™s lovely though. It™s a small, delicate -- delicate band. 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
44
Q: So th en the 50™s approach ed. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you feel -- wa -- di -- do you reme
mb er when you began to  feel comfortable 
in this country, or in 
your identity as American? 
A: The beginning was tough. I still had 
my European way of thinking. My 
upbringing. The -- certain th
ings bothered me. I -- 
Q: Like what, example? 

A: Sometimes there are bra -- they were abra
sive, the Americans. 
I used to go to  the 
subway, and I used to get up and give my  
seat away, and people thought I was crazy, 
but I was brought up this way. I couldn'
t understand otherwise. There were young 
kids spread around with the 
legs sticking out, they woul
dn™t dream of getting up. I 
couldn™t under -- this. In my mind, I criticize
d this. I ate differently, I used my fork 
and knife differently. I was different. It t
ook me time. Not that -- funny part is I 
learned to eat chicken drumstick with
 my  hand now, and I think it™s very 
comfortable. I really like it. But I wouldn
™t dare to do it at home. No, the beginning 
was tough. And the lack of 
the -- the knowledge of the la
nguage makes it very tough. 
And then  you see people who ev en  were kind
 towards the newcomer
s, still called us 
uh -- these are the -- they don™t know mu
ch, they™re from Pola
nd, what do they  
know? And I thought to myse
lf, they don™t really know
 me. They don™t know my  
potential, and to them I was -- I w as just th
e newcomer, a displace
d person. What is a 
displaced person? A person w
ho was chased away from some
where and came here in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
45
order to rebuild their life. But that person,
 ev en though may not use your language 
yet, or your customs, can be equal, or so
meti mes ev en  may b e su pe
rior to the people 
who criticize her. So the beginning wasn™t easy.  
Q: Did you feel that A mericans knew abou
t -- w-were they know ledgeable about th-
the Holocaust, especi
ally what surv ivors had gone thro ugh? 

A: Nobody who is not walkin
g in the shoes can understa
nd fu lly what has happened. 
You have to suffer to unde
rstand somebody else suffering.
 My -- my experience with 
the family, for instance, w
ith their daughter, she was minimizing everything, and I 
was -- I -- I wouldn™t talk about my expe
riences, because I felt that I created a 
disruption in  the family by my  coming there. 
I didn™t feel comfortable. I wanted to be 
on my own. So my beginnin
g was difficult, un-until I went
 back to New Jersey and 
started working. And then I got married. Ev
en after I got married, my English wasn™t 
-- getting better, not as fluent as it is now, I 
am more articulate 
with the passage of 
time because I made my business to learn 
the language properly. And I will never get 
rid of my accent, but I will speak correctly, 
hopefully. I don™t say don™t, he don™t, I 
mean, like, like, you know, you
 know. I try to avoid this, 
and I can see this in my 
own family, but th-this is something th at makes me me. 

Q: You should never lose your accent. When
 -- when did things 
get a little easier for 
you then ? 

A: Well, when I had my child, it wasn™t 
easy. I was very happy because I had the 
child, and I wanted a daughter the worst way.
 I was so partial to it th at sometimes it

46
scared me, because the doctor said I should 
-- if I attempt to have a ch ild, I shouldn™t 
have -- try again, because of my  health. So 
I said, oh, if there is any power, anything 
-- I wanted a daughter because a daughter usua
lly is closer to mother than a son. And 
when  I had a daughter, I was absolutely in
 seventh heav en . At that time my  husband 
worked nights because he ha
d 15 percent bonus for worki
ng nights. We lived in New 
York, and I lived on this fourth floor. And 
of course my  pains came in the middle of 
the night when he wasn™t ho
me. So we had prepared a te
lephone near my -- tel e phone 
-- maternity [indecipherable] so
rt of, and I called him, and th e man down stairs came, 
he says, come down. I says what do you me
an come down, I™m -- I™m -- I™m -- I have 
pains. I -- I had to walk do
wn with my little piece of lu
ggage down. It was a plain 
man with a car, who made himself maternity -- and he took me to the hospital in the 
middle of the night. I walked 
with this little luggage, with
 the pain, and they ask me, 
are you married? Because who comes alone to have a baby in  the middle of the night. 
So I said, wh at do you think? 
So th is was funny. And of 
course, after I had my -- my 
daughter, I was absolutely 
deliriously happy. And I to
tally devoted myself to 
bringing her up. And the result is good. It 
paid off. And we are very close. We share 
many interests. Well, they are diverse. For in
stance, our taste in literature is a little 
different. And I adopted some love of the new mu sic, because after all I had a 
teenager home, a girl, so I could tolerate 
The Beatles, for instan
ce. But when the new 
groups started coming, I couldn™t take th is, quite. You know, it -- an-and especially 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
47
now, it -- it™s a lot of vulgarity and -- and in
 the movements and in the -- in the lyrics, 
so-called. And this is -- this
 is totally u-undesirable. 
Q: When  you began to make 
friends here, were they othe
r survivors, or was it a -- a 
range of people? 
A: No, strangely  enough, when  I moved to  
New York City, because I got married on 
west coast, we -- we decided to come b
ack because my  husband™s mo ther became ill 
with cancer, and I said, I lost my family, a
nd I love your mo ther, we have to go back 
to New York . And I was pregnant. We a
rranged rides from city to city, sharing 
expenses until we reached -- 
reached New York. And we got
 an apartment at this 
walk-up in the Bronx, and I se
e my mother-in-law deterior
ating, but she did see her 
granddaughter born. And I loved her. 
I respected her. What else can  -- 
Q: I asked -- I asked about friends. 
A: About friends, yes. We moved to this 
build ing in the Bronx,
 and there were no 
survivors that I knew in that building, bu
t we became then the really good friends, 
because we were in the same, at th at 
time, little lower middle class financially 
people, but with the same hopes and aspi
rations. We wanted our ch ildren to be 
educated, and th  -- to have a decent upbrin
ging. I learned how to play Mahjong. And 
I played Mahjong with the ladies. And they
 were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I 
adore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my 
build ing, two across the 
street. It was safe 
to walk out on the street in 
the evening. When 
I took my baby in the carriage, we 
walked to that park
 in the evening becau
se it was hot, there was no air conditioning, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
48
and the apartment was s-stifling, and no
body was afraid because the times were 
different. And we -- I met the other mothers 
with carriages there. And the -- it wasn™t 
easy, but it was a happy time, because I ha
d what I wanted. Of course, financially 
was a little difficult. We never hit if off re
ally, but it -- it -- it -- it didn™t matter to me 
that much because I saw what
 can happen. We had so much
 and we lost it overnight. 
So, the priorities changed. What was importa
nt was to have good family and enough 
to eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools 
are free here, libraries are free here, which 
is wonderful. People don™t know, there are 
so many free. We used
 to go to Lewison 
stadium those days for free concerts. I t
ook the baby in the blanket and we were 
sitting like in a amphitheater, around, and 
listen to concerts. It was free, it was 
wonderful. So if you partake 
of wh at the city could offer you, it is not the amount of 
money th at people try to amass mo re, the 
greed is so enormous. They never have 
enough. My  prio rity was not to amassing we
alth, but wealth of cultural things, of 

good life, and I hope that in 
some measure, I achieved it. 
Q: Since you mentioned The Beatles, let™s 
just say we are in the 60™s somewhere. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Which events out of the 60™s, say, remain
 as events that were -- had an impact on 
your life? Can you -- whether here
 in the U.S., or in Israel. 
A: The Seven Day War, you mean? 

Q: I don™t know, anything th at -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
49
A: Well, as I previously s -- mentioned, I 
am not religious, however, I have a strong 
feel of Judaic tradition in me, because it is
 -- it is ethical, it™s moral and it is 
misunderstood. And I thought that my  people 
deserved to  have their homeland after f 
-- millennia of suffering. And th e creation of 
the state of Israel 
meant an -- a lot to 
me. I was d eliriously happy when Israel ca
me  into bene -- being, because it gave 
home and hope to countless people who didn™t 
have it. I remember o n e event on -- at 
Madison Square Garden, there was a big ga
thering on -- that was on the eve of the 
Six Day War, I don™t rememb er the date, but Gold a Meir was speaking, and I got 
there in, with a friend of mine. And th ey we
re holding that Isra
eli flag and people 
were just throwing money in 
it. And I had very little, but wh
atever I had, I put it in, 
because it was an -- I -- I was elated that th
e people deserved it, they should have it, 
and -- the homeland. So, I myself could not f
it into the life there, because you have to 
be strong, you have to  be healthy. My lif
e I made in Un ited States, I™m very happy 
here. I became an excellent citizen , my hus
band and I, beca
use we are civically mind 
people. We are volunteers; my  husband in hos
pitals four days a week , and I with my  
speaking and helping, and I was a school mo the
r. I went on every trip with this class. 
I was always he- helping. Of course, without
 remuneration, just because I thought it™s 
necessary. And -- you know. Yes? 

Q: I -- I want to talk about 
in -- in -- in depth, really, about your work a little later. 
For the time being, I would just like to as
k you t-two mo re questions. Did you go to 
Israel? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
50
A: I went once. 
Q: When  was that? 
A: After the Six Day War. Six Day War, it was -- when the wall -- 

Q: So it was [indecipherable] 
A: -- in Jerusalem was liberated. Now, the trip
 to Israel was, my  husband had a sister 
in Israel, who was sent by th
e parents prior -- in the 1930™s, early 1930™s. So  we went 
to his sister. And she had three daughter
s [indecipherable] were married and the -- 
the -- the sons-in-law took us wi
th the car, we went to Jerusalem. T h is I have to say, I 

have to mention this. For somebody wh
o is not religious, when I walked in 
Jerusalem, this was one of the biggest im
pacts on my  life. When I touched th e wall, 
something happened to me, b
ecause it was like a link in history. I touched the wall 
that for so many years was important to 
my  history. I rememb er my grandfather 
having th e sign for Jerusalem in his room, 
because every Jew™s hope was someday to 
be in Jerusalem. I walked the streets that
 Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of 
cross, and something happened to  me. I was 
walking on the cobbled 
street s that  Jesus 
walked. It was important to me, historica
lly. I went to the Mo
sque, to the Grand 
Mosque. I took my shoes off, 
paid my respects. I went there and I went down and I 
saw the huge rack that was supposed to 
be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to 
sacrifice his son there, Isaac, 
and God stopped him. 
So all these things that you read -
- I have books on -- on all the world™s relig
ions here, because I was interested, the 
impact of Jerusalem, it was very deep, 
emotionally, spiritually, and -- and I thought 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
51
to myself, if people only would know -- all 
three great religions are meet in this little 
place, if we could learn how to get along.
 The Arabs say Salaam, an d we say Shalom, 
it™s so much alike. Both are Semitic. Yu
goslavia, all these pe
ople, it -- it™s religion 
divides them, why? Why? 
Q: Did you see the Yad Vashem, too? 
A: Of course. 

Q: What -- what was that whole experience?
 Did you learn something th at you didn™t 
know? 
A: Yes, I -- I learned so -- a very powerful lesson, I™ll tell you wh at. Yad Vashem, 
when I went in, I was in the gallery, af -- 
that was only once, and so many years ago, 
and I looked in the somber, dark cham -- 
chamber, with the name
s of the camps. I -- I 
broke down, I cried, because 
I thought of the people who 
did not survive. And when I 
left Yad Vashem, and I opened th e door, an
d I walked out, and that was very sunny 
day, and there was this street with the tr
ees, and -- called the Aven ue of Righteous 
Gentiles, with the name of the Righteous Gentiles underneath each tree, this was my 
greatest impact of Israel, because I was not 
aware, up through that moment, that there 
were Gentiles who did help. This was the very
 first time. Nobody told me about that 
before, I don™t know why. That people 
did help , and people paid the supreme 
sacrifice, that people cared. I thought nobody 
did. And this, in itself, motivated me to 
speak and to mention th is f
act in most of my speeches,
 that there were people who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
52
were righteous, that there were people wh
o cared, in spite of everything. It was 
tremendous impact. I always mention this.  
Q: Excuse me. Let™s talk ab
out your work then
. When  did you begin -- when  did you 
begin to speak out publicly in a more cons -- 
sort of in a more c
oncen trated fashion?  
A: Well, I became -- I became more reassu
red in my English, and I -- and my 

daughter also said that I have something th at I should share with people, that a -- 

maybe -- she calls this a gift, that I am 
able to communicate and impart of my self, 
and -- and present in such a way that it w
ill be not offending to some people, but 
rather, instructional. And I try to do my very
 best to -- to fulfill 
this. I go -- I used to 
go to  every place that ask me, anybody wh
o was willing to listen, to schools, and 
church es, and public -- not rea
lly public, but groups of peopl
e that wanted to hear me, 
and I was very happy. And wh en I started to 
see the results and the letters that I was 
getting, this became the impetus 
even more so, that I was ab
le to reach some of them. 
Q: What -- what did people say? Say a little 
b it more about what kind of different 
groups you went to, and wh at -- what were
 some of the responses that you got. 
A: Well, as an example, I can give you fo
r instance the Navy in
telligence unit. This 
unit is comp rised of very young people. And I 
always tell it -- I have to repeat myself 
that if they™re in intelligence 
unit, they must be fairly in
telligent. I have to say this 
because -- but they are also, 
at the same time, are very 
gung-ho, very -- how did you 
let yourself to -- to go this way, and to  be 
done to you. They  cannot perceive that the 

circumstances under which we were, were
 so outrageous, we were not only 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
53
persecuted and beaten and st
arved by the Germans, but th
e Polish population was sort 
of enjoying it. Helping, and not helping us. 
We tried to -- to -- if we could get a gun 
smuggled to  ghetto. Me -- I understood firs
t in Yad Vashem that there were some 
Polish people who did help, 
but up til that moment, I 
did not know it. There™s a 
whole wall of people names that did help, 
and I was in a shock, because I didn™t 
know that. My love was concentrated on 
th e country of Denmark because what -- 
what they  did, as a country, as a country. They  saved ab out 95 percen t of their Jewish 

population. And I -- each time 
-- in San Diego there is a little
 place in a Balboa park 
that has that little -- a Danish place, and 
German place, and Polish place with the 
flag. On Sunday they™re open. 
Whenever I walk to the little 
Danish place, and there is 
a book th at you write, I say thank you, De
nmark. They  don™t kn
ow why and who and 
what, but it makes me feel good.  

Q: So you are trying to 
communicate to these little ma
cho young people that -- 
A: I try to communicate and you have no id
ea what a tremendous response I™ve got. 
Now this was, I would say from the entir
e group, there was one Jewish woman 
lieutenant, and one half-Jewis
h. That™s it. They were ma
gnificent, all of them. They 
listen intently, they made 
sort of mental notes. They ask question after my  
presentation. They listen to my explanation. 
I told them, yes, it™s 
easy to say, but the 
circumstan ces were su ch, we were comple
tely helpless. I said, do you know how 
many people committed suicide 
because they couldn™t do 
anything? The 
world didn™t 
listen. They -- there was a Polish repres
entative who -- who reached Un ited States, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
54
Jan Karski, he tried to tell them. T h ey didn
™t want to listen, they didn™t want to 
believe. So we were -- if the 
war would have been cut by 
a year, they could save God 
knows how many people. They never bomb ed
 the trucks that were leading to 
Auschwitz. So -- 
Q: Did you tell them about s-small acts of re
sistance, as -- such as your -- your own? 
A: I did -- my -- absolutely. Th
is -- this was a hit, because 
this sabotage, in their eyes, 
was a tremendous act of courage, which it 
was, because we risked death at every 
moment. But at that point we didn™t care
 anyway, because we thought we will die 
anyway.  
Q: This is a story, just for our listeners, a 
story that Blanka has to
ld in the videotaped 
interview, when she was work
ing in an aircraft factory,
 when she committed acts of 
sabotage, really. 

A: Ye-Yes. While -- excuse me, while I was 
riveting -- joining parts of the wings of 
the p -- airplanes, I noticed a small notatio
n in a Russian script, done by the Russian 

prisoners of war who work ed at night shift,
 i-instructing us wh
at to do and how to 
sabotage. When we join
ed the two parts, to leave a little
 bit opening at every third or 
fourth rivet, hoping that the force of 
air will force this rivet out. And this was 
tremendous, tremendous thing [indecipherabl
e] us, and -- for us, and the -- the young 
intelligence officers were 
absolutely s -- mesmerized by this story. 
Q: Yeah, we should -- unfortunately we shoul
d stop here. And this 
is the end of tape 
two, side B, interview 
with Blanka Rothschild.

End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
56
Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. This 
is tape number three, side
 A. So, I just wanted to 
follow-up a little bit on the response from 
the Naval intelligence unit. Just maybe 
elaborate a little bit more on wh
at they said, and -- and -- 
A: Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, th
ey were very intent on listening, they 
were very polite. And when I 
finished, I™ve seen few tears,
 I must say I did. Because 
they were -- majority were men, but ther
e a couple of wo men lieutenants, too. And 
then there was a question answ er period
, and the qu -- tw o questions which very 
frequently  come up were asked there as 
well. And one of them was how did we 
permit this to happen  to us. And of course
, the answer is very 
incomprehensible to 

them, but I try my very best to tell them 
that the circumstances under which we were 
kept comp letely preven ted us from doing anyt
hing. There were a couple of revolts in 
some camp s, I believe, small, that the peop
le were able to get some guns, some 
ammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto
 had revolt. But in Lódz ghetto, for 
instance, where I was, it was impossible. 
We were surrounded by
 very anti-Semitic 
population. We could not get a
ny gun for the life of it. W e were -- as a matter of fact, 
the people were rejoicing seeing our terribl
e situation. So  -- and we were starved. 
Now, if you are starved, y
ou don™t have strength to pi
ck up anything, how can you 
fight? That™s why people were committing su
icides, a lot of them. Besides the spirit 
was completely broken when
 you saw memb ers of your 
family and children being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
57
taken away, and knew -- by that time you al
ready knew that they were going to 
places where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. The second question that 
very often I am asked is if I can forgive.
 I believe that I even
 spoke about it on my 
videotape, and this question has two 
prongs. The people who committed these 
horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, mu
rder human beings, no I cannot forgiv e 
them, and I never will. But the other peopl
e, the other German 
people, who did not 
participate, who were born after the war, 
who help, like Jehovah 
Witnesses, there is 
nothing to fo rgiv e. They did not do anythi
ng wrong. So as I said
, there are two parts 
of this question.  

Q: When  you go to -- you go to  other pla
ce, to schools for instance, what -- ho-how 
do you sort of experien ce a response there? 
A: Well, when I go to school
s, I try to tailor myself to 
the audience that I™m speaking 
to. If I am in a class of let™s say, junior
 high students, who are young children, I 
always tell them to close their eyes in 
the beginning of my  pr
esentation, because 
what they see in front of 
them is an elderly lady who 
has some problems walking, 
and they  cannot relate too mu ch  to her. So  
when I ask them to close their eyes and try 
for a moment to visualize me
 as th ey are now, a-as I 
once was. I was a young girl, 
and I had shared the same inte
rests as they do now. I wa
s thinking of my  friends, and 
I was thinking of boys, and of secrets. So I 
was young, and I was fairly good looking, 
and I didn™t have any other worries as -- 
if I g-got enough weekly  allowance to buy 
my self something. But of course, now I™m ol
der. So I -- I try to sort of bring them a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
58
little bit up to my level, and lower myself to
 their level and I go from there. So when 
I speak about us as young girls 
in ghetto, they try to -- try to
 bring this to the previous 
saying, that oh yes, I was once young, and 
how did I got into the situation? They  
listen intently, and they ask question afte
rwards, and they write me letters. I™m a 
recipient of many, many hu-hundreds of lette
rs, some of them which I sent to the 
archives, to the museum.  

Q: In the end of this interv
iew, maybe you can read a fe
w excerpts from such letters. 
I have some, yeah -- not -- not right now, maybe. 
A: All right. 
Q: But -- but later on, so -- 

A: All right. There is a Catholic school he
re in San Diego, Sa
int Madeline™s, and I 
spoke. I was invited there three times already,
 to different classes. And I said to the 
teacher, but I™m repeating myself. She said, 
but what you think the teachers do every 
year, they repeat themselves. 
And it™s a different class. A s a matter o f fact, some lay-

sisters came from other classes, w ere standi
ng at the door to listen, and -- and the 
receptionist always [indeciphera
ble] they -- they -- they 
ask questions, they bright, 
they have -- they show that 
they have good schooling, an
d this is very rewarding to 
me, because if I can reach 
couple of them, th
en th -- I accomplished something. 
Q: Do you think the impact, 
or the impression of a surviv
or in -- in person, talking 
about it, is a different one than readin
g it from -- i-in books or seeing films? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
59
A: Abso lutely, absolu
tely, absolutely. And this is 
why I drive my self even though 
physically it™s getting exceedingly diffing -- 
difficult for me to do so, because I am 
disabled. But I -- I -- I still try and -- when I 
tell them that they will be able in the 
future to say to some -- maybe their own 
ch ildren, I heard the story from the mouth 
of actual survivor, not from a book. And th er
e is an imp act there. And the children, 
especially the -- the brighter 
ones, they do respond
 to it. They react. And that makes 
me happy.  
Q: Can you think of an example? 
A: Yes, I can think of the example 
of -- which is the letter that -- 
Q: Yeah [indecipherable] 
A: -- from the high school. 
Q: I -- I looked fo r the -- 
A: And th-this was a girl in high school, in 
a very affluent part 
of San Diego, who has 
written me. 

Q: Which one is it, this one? 
A: Yes. And my -- 
Q: Oh, your glasses?  

A: I had them -- 
Q: [indecipherable] they™re just
 looking for -- over there.  
A: Yes. The girl who has written me, and I 
thought that was very significant. As a 
matter of fact I sent a copy of it to D
r. Ringleheim in the museum. ﬁDear Mrs. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
60
Roth schild. Thank you for coming to our 
school and telling us about the way it was 
for you in the World War 
11
. It meant a lot to me. My 
views on wh ite supremacy and 
hating people of other ethnic 
backgrounds were changed. 
Your presentation helped 
me realize a lot of things that I never ev
en thought of. I felt te
rrible to think my 
boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped
 the man, the same kind of a man that 
broke your back, or hit your gran dmother. I™m  very sorry for many things I have said 
and done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the 
SS  tattooed on my  hand. There are a lot of 
young people such as me who never even stop
ped to think of the 
real terrors. I know 
you made a great impression on my  mind, a
nd I had stopped to th
ink of the things 
that I have said and done. Si
ncerely, C. Hale.ﬂ Now, the letter is grammatically  very 

poorly written, especially fo
r a high school student in 
an affluent area. However, I 
made a dent in her way of thinking. I made 
her think, and that is extremely imp o rtant 
to me. She thought well enough
 of it to sit down and write to me. T h at means that she 
-- she some -- some so rt of changed occu rred in her. Now, even s -- even small 

change. If she asks me to please continue sp
eaking to people like 
her, that mean s that 
I have done some good.  

Q: You have spoken now fo r about 30 years? 

A: About, just about. 
Q: About [inaudible] 
A: Yes. 

Q: What is the price that you pay for that role? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
61
A: The price that I pay is my health. 
It is getting extremely difficult for me, 
especially when I have to tr
avel. But I do not want to s-
s -- keep that occasion. If I™m 
invited -- for instance, I was invited to Duke
 University twice already. And I went the 
first time a-absolutely on my
 co st, because I do not charge
 for my speaking, I feel 
this is my obligation, my obligation to -- 
to those who cannot speak for themselves. 
The second time I was invited, and I was -- 
I was provided with a fare and a hotel, 
which helped. But of course, nothing fo r 
the speaking. And I re
ceived a booklet, 
beautifully done, because I spoke for tw
o days. The first day it was in a large 
auditorium which was filled to
 capacity. Besides the stud
ents, there was also some 
contingent of faculty and ministers, coupl
e ministers. And the kids who came little 
bit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the 
floor, because all the seats were taken. And 
the second day I spoke in a classroom. This 
is a special course on
 Holocaust at Duke 
Institute at this year. And the teacher of
 the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is 
Polish, was kind enough to send me a bookl et comp rised of the letters, he-headed by 

her own letter, and in which she said that sh
e gave the students a task of instead of a 
final, to write a letter responding to Mrs. 
Rothschild. And I have the letters, and this 

just very special to me, and a copy of 
it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the 
second co py I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the mu seum. 
Q: Yeah, at the end of this interview we
 will read a -- a few excerpts from -- from 
that booklet. But let me ask you also, wh
en  I ask you about the price, does it get

62
easier to speak about it as th
e years go on, or do you still ha
ve a -- bad nights before 
or after, and bad dreams?  
A: I -- I usually have, no matter how many 
years I will speak, th
ere is apprehension 
before I go, because I don™t know what kind 
of audience or reception I will receive, 
and there is sleeplessn ess that is usually a
ssociated with it, and it -- it bothers me a 
great deal. And then after I speak, and I co
me home, even though
 it was very good 
reception, I always have some thoughts th
at I omitted something important, that I 
should have said this or th
at, and that was of major imp o rtance. But there is a sense 
of accomplishment. 
Q: Have you ever mistrusted your memo ry? 

A: I made couple of mistakes
, even on my video. I tried 
to -- to tell D
r. Joan at the 
very end, when I speak of my liberation, 
on the interviewer asked me the day I was 
liberated, I said, April 26, 1
944, and it was 1945. That™s one thing. And another one 
was oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my  mo th
er. I -- I just cannot say the right -- 
maybe this is this -- the terrible pain that 
I have in my  heart. And also, once I made a 
mistake on --in my speaking, wh
en I talked about Bittenberg,
 which is the city that I 
slaved in Arado airplane factory, and I sa
id that the city had 
the church on which 

door the Martin Luth er affixed the 1905 
thesis. And in one sp
eech I said Martin 
Luth er King. And th ey couldn™t take that King out, because it was too late.

Q: Well, we have corrected it here. Do you 
do anything to -- just to -- to ha -- to 
stimulate y our memory? Is it -- is it fading, or
 is it still very st
rong, except for now 
and then ? 
A: A cert -- no, certain things are very de
eply engraved 
on my memory
, that I will 
always repeat it, and they stay with me
. But many things slowly start fading aw ay. 
And that™s why it™s so important that I did sp
eak for all t h ese years. Yes, some t h ings 
I -- as I said previously, I try to eras
e fro m my  memo r y , lik e th e faces o f  my  
tormentors. But some -- dates,
 for instance, I don™t reme
mb er. And I don™t rememb er 
what I wore when I left that camp. I calle
d my  friend in New York  who was also in a 
camp, she™s, don™t you reme mb er? I sa
id no. Then I -- I ask somebody about 
something and she said, Blanka, but I was w
ith you. And I didn™t remember that. So 
the age takes over. That™s why I™m
 speeding with 
my speaking.  
Q: Did you ever go back 
to Germany, to Poland? 
A: I was in Poland only after I was liberated
, and once I left after the bad reception, I 
decided never, ever to come 
back to Poland. I was back 
in Germany couple of times, 
because the German government
 recognized that 
they did impair 
my health quite 
badly. They crippled  me, and the condition 
is worsening with ag
e, so a couple of 
times I was granted a so-called cour. I was in
 a resort that the doctor treated me, and I 
received treatments, however what they gave
 me was not sufficient to cover all the 
expenses like flight and the hotel, so I ha
d to stop going to  Germ
any for that reason. 
The treatments were wonderful, much superi
or to the ones that I™m getting here. I™m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
64
going now to, so far, couple 
of times to Canestoga spa, which has some bath, and 
they are not quite the same qua
lity and value. But it does he
lp me, so I do go there.  
Q: You never received compensation for slave labor? 
A: Not so far, I -- I™m receiving a gesundheits
han. I™m receiving a 
m-monthly rent for 
my broken health, but now th
ere is a class action for the slave labor and I filled the 
papers, and I hope that I will be able to -- 
after all, I worked in
 Lódz ghetto for a few 
years, in a -- is -- not factory, but th
is was establishment. I was working making 
sweaters fo r Germans, they 
need ed  for the winters. And th en we were working on 
some cement place, making blocks for the bu
ildings that were be
ing destroyed. And 
of course in the airplane factor
y until the liberation in the camp.  

Q: When  you went back to Germany, wh at
 was your impression then of the country 
of the Germans? Was there something that
 stays with you? Co nversations you have 
had, things you have seen? 

A: Well, when I went there, I used to go
 to the spa. In th e spa there were many 
people wh o were coming fo r their vacation, a
nd they were at the -- 
their very best, at 
leisure. And if they ever ask me anythi
ng -- not a person that I met k n ew about 
anything, so they were quite
 innocent. They did not know  about the atrocities, they 
did not hear about the camps. Anyway , 
the people that I met never, with the 
exception of the old lady in Berlin after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and 

so were all her friends, the doctor and the pe
rsonnel in the spa were very nice. After 
all, they were being paid for it, and the pe
ople that I met there were friendly with me, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
65
but then  I met couple of Du tch people there 
who come in for the same treatment. And 
there were a couple of peop
le even from Israel that 
I met there, and the local 
population I -- I -- I made friends with a ma
n who made me brace, because I have to 
wear back brace, I just put 
it on. And in the beginning he
 -- his reaction was not too 
friendly, but after awhile when
 he got to know me, he be
came very friendly. He and 
his wife visited us in Un ited States. He made
 me brace, for wh ich he was paid by the 
German government, and he made me a brace as a gift.  
Q: Do you think his original
 unfriendliness had -- he was just a grumpy person, or 
did it have something to  do with  who you 
were? Not you as a person, but that you 
were Jewish? 

A: I really couldn™t put my finger on it. He
 was not too intelligent man, but he was a 
very good busin essman. So  he knew how 
to -- how to work 
fo r the government 
because he was doing this t
ype of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not 
too many people nowadays know 
this. There™s no industry fo
r making this type of 
braces, so he was just about one of very fe
w in all of Germany, and he cashed on it. 
In the beginning why he wasn™t too fri
endly, well I was somebody strange, and 
maybe he thought that I resented him. 
I had to go to him from Bad Kissingen to  
Schweinhold on train, but the next time when
 he saw me and he 
-- he met me, and he 
sort of liked me, he came with his car to pick
 me up, and spare me the ride on a train.  
Q: Nice. Did you have any 
anti -- did you hear any anti-
Semitic remarks anywhere? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
66
A: Well, wa -- once. People were careful with
 me wh en  th ey
 knew that I was Jewish, 
but once I had an  incident because the coup
le did not know I was Jewish. And that 
was in a café and we were sitting at the sa
me table, and they admired me, I™m -- to 
them I was somebody from America. And 
th ey said, how do you like Germany? And 
I said it™s v ery nice. And they said, well 
it™s very nice, but too many Jewish people 
are coming back. And at that point I excuse
d them from my  table. At the same  token 
I spoke -- my  husband was with me the last
 time -- couple of times because I needed  
escort, I couldn™t travel by myself. My 
husband and I were sitting in the park, 
speaking of course, English. And an elderl
y gentleman with wife were sitting nearby 
and start the conversation with
 us in German. And he b
ecame a friend. He was there 
for his health. And we went 
to the cafés together, and he
 was a very charming man, 
and he -- when we left for the States, th
ey brought us very nice gift. And we 
exchanged Christmas greetings. 
Q: You also told me, and not on the tape 
yet, but I would like you to  talk about it, 
that you had invited younger German people
 to your home in New York . Maybe you 
could say something about that. When  -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- when was that, and what -- 
A: When I lived in New York 
City, prior to being on the 
west coast, we lived for 20 
years in the city, we -- I contacted the 
-- The Quaker Society,
 American Friend 
Society, and I ask them to send a couple
 of students for a holiday for a dinner, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
67
because I wanted people from 
different countries to learn  
about us, and I thought that 
one on one, it™s the best way to learn ab
out people. And one day the lady from The 
Friend Society called me and asked me if I 
would mind if she would send a German 
girl. And I said, by all means send her to me
, let her see me as I am. And she and a 
Dutch girl came together to our house. Sh
e was in the beginning very shy, and very 
sort of frightened. But as th
e things progressed, and th e dinner, we became quite 
friendly, and she left as a friend, and th at
 was an accomplishment. Yes, I think that 
the young people should try to reach and m
eet, maybe some survivors, or people who 
-- whose family suffered to -- to form a 
common bond. It™s very important when 
people try to understand each other. After 
all, we are all individuals, we are all 
different. We have different points of view
, religions, cultural background, but we are 
all human beings, so if we try to over
come our prejudices, and reach a hand and 
listen, then the world would be
 much better, mu
ch better off. 
Q: Do you still have hope? 

A: Ah, that™s such a tricky s -- question. 
Q: Honestly now. 
A: Honestly I -- I am -- I am at times 
pessimistic, because I don™t see mu ch progress 
in many parts of the world. I™m afraid that
 the human race did not learn the powerful 
lessons that Holo caust and the prev ious ge
nocides provided. They
 are still going on 
around th e globe. And it™s not only Yu goslav
ia, but it™s in Rwanda, it™s in Sri Lanka, 
it™s in yugo -- it™s in Ireland. Bo -B oth people are Christian, only different 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
68
denomination and th ey hate one another. I -- 
this is the greatest divisor of people, 
religion. And if people would really, truly 
were religious in their hearts, they would 
find a way to -- to find this common bond, an
d the link. But truthfully, when I see the 
situation in Koso vo and Yugoslavia, 
I -- I am not too optimistic, sadly. 
Q: This is the end of tape three, side
 A, interview with 
Blanka Roth schild. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Blanka Rothschild. This 
is tape number three, side B. So after the sort of 
skeptical statement that you have just made
, maybe we can contin ue with some hope 
afterwards, because we are looking at
 a booklet now. Maybe you should say 
something about that -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and then we™ll read a few ex-excerpts. 

A: Yes, on -- my last speaking enda -- e
ngagement was at Duke University, and I 
spoke twice, one day to th
e third auditorium of student and so me faculty and 
ministers, and the next day 
I spoke before a class which was instituted this year, 
specifically  on Holocaust. The class is sma
ll si -- consisting of
 a teacher and 16 
students, and this teacher was kind enough
 to send me a lovely
, bound booklet with 
some of the -- with the lette
rs. And she said she had high
 expectation for the class 
and student, and she worried, 
but eventually the 
class -- she was afraid that the class 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
69
become desensitized by the narratives of
 horror. But eventu
ally she saw the 
transformation of students to deeper un
derstanding. And she said, ﬁThis is the 
moment that all teachers dream o f, and I knew
 that the class had been successful. It 
was your visit and your important message
 th at coincided with this success. The 
student had already begun to 
bring the Ho locaust, the human capacity for genocide, 
and the resp onsibility of the 
bystander into discussion about
 current social injustices 
around th e world. They had started to 
question their own co
mplicity. They asked 
what they could do for Ko
so vo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on 
our own soil, and it was your talk, your 
willingness to speak of your losses and to 
testify for those who are forever silent. Your 
dedication to social action that solidified 
this response from the students. It was inva
luable for all students, ranging from those 
who had never studied the Holo caust to your
 own gran ddaughter, to hear a survivor 
bear witness. All of the students posted 
lengthy notes about your
 visit on our email 
news -- newsgroup.ﬂ And I will read a couple of excerpts. 
Q: Yeah ga -- about five or so, becaus
e they are really important, I think. 
A: Yes, by the way, they -- they endeared 
themselves to me be
cause they all called 
me Nana, as my granddaughter does, who is
 part of this class. ﬁDear Nana, some 

people come into our lives 
and quickly live -- leave. So
me stay for awhile, leave 
footprints on our hearts, and we are never, ev
er the same.ﬂ This is how she started her 

response. Maggie Gandi wrote, ﬁMrs. 
Rothschild made clear not only her 
appreciation for the fact that we are st
udying the Holo caust, but also channe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
70
challenged us to spread wh at we have lear
ned to futu re genera
tions. Therefore, I™m 
going to take from this class, more than 
the images provoked by any one passage or 
movie clip, are the words of Mrs. Rothschild
. The challenge that 
we not forget what 
we have learned, and th at we bear some
 of her burden by pa
ssing our knowledge onto 
our ch ildren and peers, so the stories of 
the Holocaust are never forgotten.ﬂ Another 
student wrote, ﬁI had such a great time ta
lking to her, not only ab out her Holo caust 
experiences, but about life in general. I think that it took so  mu ch co urage and 

fortitude for her to speak for over 30 ye
ars about -- 20 years, about her horrific 
experience during th e war. I just want to fi
nish by saying that I admire Alexis™s 
grandmother so much for not on
ly coming to talk to us, bu
t for just volunteering to 
talk to anyone who is willing to listen. I al
so admire her because 
she has such an air 
of dignity and pride that surrounds her. I 
am definitely a better person fo r having met 
her.ﬂ There™s so many. [indecipherable] Let™s see now, I can™t find -- ﬁIn our final 

meeting the students presented me with a gi
ft. They gave me a 
picture from -- frame 
engraved with the words, we
 will remember, April 14, 19
99. Inside was a photo of 
you and I with the entire class, taken on th e da
y of -- of your visit. For me this gift is 
a lasting monument, a commitment that the 
members o f col -- Holocaust testimonies 

will remain  vigilant, strive for social justi
ce, and educate future 
generations about the 
Holocaust.ﬂ This is what -- she had it 
-- her letter with, but I wanted Melina. 
Q: Take your time. Just look fo r the ones
 that you really want to -- to read.

A: This letter I™ll -- I™ll read an excerpt 
from, is from a girl fro
m a -- Koso vo. Dear 
Nana, I™m writing this letter to thank yo
u for coming to Duke
 on Wednesday. I -- 
although I was unable to attend your formal 
talk, I enjoyed hearing your stories from 
an intimate perspectiv
e. They ™re extremely vivid accounts
 of your experiences in the 
concen tration camp, and en courag ed me to 
think more about the 
situation in regards 
to my relatives in Kosovo. I am sure that those who have heard you speak will agree 
that you have made a trem
endous impact on their lives. I will never forget being 
moved to  tears by your word s and emotion.
 I find it extremely fortunate that I w as 
able to hear your experiences. Again, I 
thank you so much for 
coming. Until then, to 
your health and happiness. Melina.ﬂ And th
is is from my granddaughter. ﬁDear Nana, 
thank you for doing something 
for me that forever will be 
part of my memories at 
Duke. Your speech was wonde
rful and inspirational as us
 -- always. The presence 
that you have wh ile speaking to  o -- strange
rs, bearing your soul
 and revealing some 
of your most painful experiences, astounds
 me. As I have said before, your family 
can rest in peace knowing that you to ld and 
continue to tell their story. You are -- you 
have touched many lives with your testim
ony, but you have touched me because of 
the person you ca -- became -- become af
ter the war. Your generosity, love and 
strength are your greatest as
sets and you have taught me
 well, as I now en ter my 
senior year of Duke and begin to look for 
the road I will travel next, I will keep all 
that you have told me in my heart. Th
ank you again fo r coming to Duke and for 
sharing yourself so unselfishly. 
I love you. Always, Alexis.ﬂ

72
Q: How does that mak e you feel when you read that? 
A: Wonderful. Wonderful. Th
-There™s so many of them he
re, it™s -- well, but Joan 
has it. 
Q: Yeah. So you -- our listeners who would lik
e to read more of those can find it at 
the Holocaust Museum. 

A: Yes, the booklet is -- I -- the teach
er was thoughtfu l enough to  send me two 
copies, one for me and one for the museum
 specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr. 
ronga -- Ringelheim. 
Q: Well, since we are with the museum, 
let me follow up with 
a question about the 
mu seum. How do you -- how do you see the ro
le of the Holocaust
 Museum in -- in 
Washington, D.C.? Ho w do you fe
el about what -- what they
 are doing, or wh at they 
have done already? 
A: Well, I express myself, I feel very el
oquently about it on my  video. I -- I was 
absolutely delighted 
with the creation of this muse
um, because it is a tremendous 
tool, not only of showing people what ha
s happened, but as a tool for educating 
people for the future, how to 
learn to get along. How to -- how to see things from the 
perspective of different human beings, pe
ople who went through it, people who did 
help, people who taught about it. The muse
um has testimonies of so many surv ivors, 
and they  range from people who can hardly  
express themselves to people who are 
very articulate and who can just bare thei
r soul, and try to teach the listeners, and 
open their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
73
Q: I™ve heard some survivors be quite critical
, though, of the fact that this is not a 
museum solely dedicated to Jewish surv
ivors. Ho-How do you  feel about that? 
A: No, I disagree strongly. I disagree beca
use then it would defeat the purpose. If it 
would be only to perpetuate 
the Jewish Holocaust, it would 
be very parochial. I think 
that the mu seum is a warning and teaching 
experience for people of all persuasions 
all around the world, of all the people who ca
n have the access to the museum. It is a 
mo rally and ethically marvelous tool, becaus
e it exposes people to -- not only to  the 
evil, but also to the goodness.
 It exposes people to the 
teaching of the survivors like 
myself, what did they learn,
 and what did they want to
 tell the future generations? 
Because we as survivors are getting old, and 
we are dying out, and we will be the last 
ones who will be heard from. 
Q: Do you think there can ev
er be too mu ch education ab
out the Holo caust? Because 
some people are also a little 
fearful that too much quot
e, fixation on the Holocaust 
takes away from more -- fr-from o the
r aspects of Jewish culture. 
A: I don™t think so. I disagree. This is my
 point of view . You can never take away 
from the culture by teaching people how to ge
t along with other people. It is this -- 
my individual understanding, and I hope by
 -- that people who will listen to me will 
agree with me, that 
the museum, it was created for th
e purpose of teaching people to 
avoid in the future, genocides not only 
of Jewish people, but all the people 
everywhere on this earth. Unfortunately, we
 have the bad examples occurring now 
throughout the world. And this mu seum t
eaches people how to -- how to  understand 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
74
this, and how to avoid. How can the mu seum
 be a -- a -- o-only preaching about the 
Jewish genocide? There™s genocid e now going on. 
Q: D-Do you feel that there was a certain
 point in American history when  people 
were beginning to be mo re 
interested and more knowle
dgeab le about the Holo caust 
in -- in -- as -- as a whole? Was -- do you th
ink there was a certain turning point, or -- 
yeah, well, that™s the first point of my  question. 

A: I think th at many of the survivors who 
became successful in their private lives 
were very instrumental in 
pushing the idea of creating this mu seum, and they  were 
able to support it financially. And ever sinc
e that time -- there are other museums in 
different countries that are being spurred 
by the idea of the -- of the Washington 
Holocaust Museum. 
Q: And how do you feel about sort of popul
ar films and -- and sort of popular culture 
to -- representing the Holocaust? 
A: Well, I™m not too fo nd of them because 
they could never really portray th e true 
Holocaust. The movie ﬁHolocaustﬂ 
that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy 
tale, absolutely pointless. On
 the other hand, ﬁSchindler™s Listﬂ was a teaching tool. I 
feel that Schindler deserved
 to be mentioned because no
 matter what his motives in 
the beginning were -- he was a businessman 
who wanted to cash in on, and make 
money. However, even tually, by seeing the in
justice and the h-horror of the German 
authorities, he changed his 
mind and he became instrume
ntal in saving people. So 
this fi-film I believe it -- it was w o rthwhile. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
75
Q: Do you -- are you a part of a s-survivor 
group, or do you -- do
 you so cialize with 
survivors? 
A: Not really, because where I lived, I -- I 
have my few friends 
here who happen to 
be just American born friends, and not ne
cessarily Jewish. I -- we have a writing 
class, we h ave a reading club, and I also
 play Bridge. I do not belong to  the group 
which is very active in our city, of -- there 
is no -- no reason really, I just can™t travel 
them and I -- I stay in touch with  people who 
help me because I can™t drive, they pick 
me up and take me with them. 
Q: Is there anything that you would like to 
say to end this interview? I have asked 
you wh at I wanted you to ask -- 
what I wanted  to ask you and -- 
A: As usual, my  ending would be first th
anking the interviewer for taking the time, 
and being very kind, and asking me all the 
questions and traveli
ng here in the very 
hot day. And my  philoso phy is always th
e same, I try to persuade people to open 
their hearts, and open their ears, and th inking 
of -- that we are here on this earth, put 
on temporarily, and we should make the best of
 the time that is allotted to us. Why do 
we have to  fight? Wh at divides us? We a
ll are of human race, no matter what color, 
what religious persuasion. We
 should concen trate on doing the very best to get along 
and to -- to divert our energy and resources 
to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that 
we have spread around the world. 
Q: Unfo rtunately, I have just thought of one 
more question, and that™s the very last -- 
A: That™s ok -- that™s all right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 
 
  
 

 
 
76
Q: -- I promise. When you th
ink back about the last 55 years, that™s a long time, it™s 
five and a half decades, is there so mething 
that you can say about that second life, if 
you will, that you have lived -- 
and are still living, of course. 
A: Well -- well, my life as I would have th
ought when  I was you
ng and hope for the 
future, it™s very different from the one I pi
ctured for myself. For one thing I thought 
that I will go on with my education to -- to
 the -- to the nth degree because school 
was always my -- my favorite. And my h
ealth problems prevented me from it. 
However, I taught my self English well enough 
to be ab le to speak ab out it. And I -- 
and I educated my  daughter in the manner th
at I wanted to be educated myself. And 
the next generation, my  gran ddaughter as we
ll. So these 50 years, I am proud of what 
I did in my small measure, to -- to help. And 
I can see that the help is in the form of 
the letters that I receive from people who lis
ten to me, and in the next generation, my 
daughter and my  gran ddaughter, who are perpetuating my  dream of good life and
