Beginning Tape On e 
 
Question: Good morning, Lore. 
Answer: Good mo
rn ing ,  Jo an . 
Q: It™s nice to see you. Tell me what -- what 
your name was -- what -- what is your name 
now? 

A: My name now is Lore Segal. 

Q: And -- 

A: I was born Lore Groszmann. 
Q: But it was Lore? 
A: It was Lore, and nobody can pronounce it 
the way my  mo ther did, which is Loourie, 
you see, is the Au strian way to do it. 
Q: So, it was a very long O. 
A: In -- and in -- while I lived in England,
 I was Lorry, like a truck. But now people ask 
me how to pronounce it and I say o-open season, any -- 
Q: O -- and what was your date of birth? 
A: March 8
th
, 1928. 
Q: Now tell me something. This is, for me, 
somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a 
novel about your -- about your ex periences in
 Vienna and going to  England. Why did you 
decide to write a novel and not a memo ir? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

A: Because I was really less interested in th
e history than in being a writer. And for many 
years -- I -- I have written little stories before
 that, and I came to the point in my 20™s 
when  it seemed to me I had no subject. I hadn™
t been in love, I hadn™t died. None of the 
big even ts had happened to me, and I wanted
 to be writing. And it seemed to me that 
these stories that I did have with  -- my  e
xperiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew 
about them. And then one day I 
-- when i-in -- in my early da
ys in New York , I had gone 
to the new school and taken a course in crea
tive writing, and we -- the people in that class 
had a s -- had a -- had a party. And somebody
 said to me, how did you come to the 
United States? And I began to tell my -- my H
itler stories. And there was that silence in 
the room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn™t experienced at that time. I thought, 
gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- a
nd -- and it came to me that these stories were 
my subject. But again, I wa -- didn™t write th
em because I wanted to -- what I think is 
now known as bearing witness. I wanted to  be
 writing. And I -- I mean another answer is 
that as a novelist you can in a way -- it™s a clic
hé, it™s a truism, but you can be truer that 
you can -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- by sticking to the facts. 
Can I give you an example of -- 
Q: Sure. 
A: -- how writing as a novelist changed wh at 
might be a fact. One of the -- one of the 
chapters in ﬁOther People™s Housesﬂ was about  my  attraction for aw hile to the stories of 

Christianity. No-Notice that I™m
 -- it™s the stories that attr
acted me. Now, 
in the chapter 
about this in ﬁOther People™s Housesﬂ, I 
mad e it may -- the narrative seems to suggest 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
3 
 
 
that it was the people in -- my foster parents 
at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two 
foster mothers tried to convert 
me. And when they go
t to -- when th -- one of them at any 
rate, read the story, s -- read the book, sh
e wrote me and said, but we never tried to 
convert you. And I wrote back 
and said absolutely not, y
ou didn™t. But for an -- for a 
story, to be seduced by a pers
on is more -- is a be -- it™s a 
better story than being seduced 
by an idea. In fact, it™s almost impossible n
ovelisticly to write that
. Sonovels suit me 
better than history, or biography, or 
auto-b iography. It™s a long an swer.  
Q: No, it™s very -- it™s very interesting. 
So is -- is doing an  interview somewhat 
problematic for you because you are not bein
g a novelist now, when I ask you questions? 
A: Oh, no. I will try and answ
er you historically. But I -- as we were saying earlier, once 
you have actually written someth
ing, or even told 
it a lot, something ha
s happened to it. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: It -- it b ecomes overlaid with, I guess a skin
. Like an anecdote ge
ts a kind of polish on 
it that is almost impossible to -- 

Q: To remove that skin. 

A: -- to remove that skin and 
get back. But it™s an interesting 
thing to do. I think it™s what 
one would do in  -- in analysis, 
I think. Wh en  you™ve got -- you -- you go back  to -- to the 
-- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say re
al,  but you go back to th
e -- to the event as it 
happened , or try to. And th at™s an interesting 
-- so this is interesti
ng thing to do. I don™t 
know how -- how well I can unpack wh
at was -- what was wrapped up.  
Q: Well, we-we™ll divide our -- our -- your stor y in to a few parts. So let™s -- we™ll go from 

28 to  38 bef -- before you actually leave Vienna
. So  when you th ink about your parents as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

a kid, wh at is your -- wh at is your earliest
 me mo ry of being in  Vienna? How -- how far 
back do you go? Cause you™re 
born in 1928. Are you five, are you four, are you six, 
eight? Do  you have -- 
A: Well, once again, as -- as with all t
hose me mo ries, I don™t know what are the 
memories, andwhat are 
the stories told me.  
Q: Mm, mm. 
A: I mean, I have a lot of memories being a cu
te kid, very cute, and very mu ch  beloved. I 
was the only grandchild, the only
 child, the only gr
andchild, the only niece of two loving 
uncles. So I was a big deal. I will tell you the 
embarrassing story which explains this. My 

mo ther loved to tell the story against -- she fe
lt it a story against herself, that she took me 
with her to a ladies™ café yousa, a -- a coffee 
klatch. And all the ladies were talking with 
each other and at the end, as my little coat wa
s being put on, I was re
ported to have said, 
here one knows noth ing, here one speaks of no
thing. I might have be
en five, or six. And 
my  mo ther said, what do you mean? And I said, 
here they don™t know 
that I dance on my  
toes. Here they don™t know th
at I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. No, I must have 
been older, seven -- six or seven [indecipher
ab le]. And my  mo ther was embarrassed and 
realized that I had been made too much o
f, and too mu ch  admired and too mu ch  praise. 
But I always thought that I™m in
credibly lucky to ha
ve been brought up by two of the best 
people in the world that I know. My moth
er and my  Uncle Paul, who -- who were both 
witty, loving, very, very, very 
much attached to me. Gave me
 a lot of space to show off. 
That was a world in which my poor very la
r -- father, who was a 
six-footer, which was 
unusual for -- for a European  Jew, I think, 
who was a -- who was an accountan t, a chief 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

accountant in the Bank of Cooksbro ck and 
company, was an outsider. He was odd man 
out. He was not able to laugh, 
he was not able to participate in the fun th at we had before 
he walked in the door. He wa
s very dear and very lackin
g in imagination and became, 
when I was five -- this certainly
 is a datable event, and one 
that I remember, became very 
ill. He was a bleeder. 
Q: Oh. 
A: I suppose not th-the worst degree of bleede
r, otherwise he wouldn™t have surv ived , but 
he™s -- he was taking my  mo ther is the story,
 for a bicycle ride along the [indecipherable] 
the -- the dia -- the Danube -- I don™t know wh at an [indecipherable] what -- what -- what 
-- what broke down -- wh-what -- what is -- 
what is supposed to hold the water in? 
Q: Dike? 
A: Yeah. An yhow, it was a long road, and th
ey were -- they were riding along it and 
some partridges -- he saw some partridges an
d he took his hands off the bicycle and 
clapped and fell off and began to  bleed. And 
I remember we were in my grandfather™s 
house in the village of Fischamend, which is  some half an hour by train from Vienna. 

Very close now, 10 minutes now from the 
modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my  
grandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge hous
e with a store, with 
my  grandfather™s straggled store at the bo
ttom. And I remember my parents had their 

own room back there. My fath
er -- remember my father flat
 on -- on the bed. He had -- he 
-- I-I remember particular that he was not a
llowed to have a -- a p
illow, and oddly enough 
I cannot bear to lie for two seconds withou
t a pillow under my he
ad. But that -- he -- 
there was a bucket of ice water next to his 
bed with little balls of butter which he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

supposed to eat. I don™t remem -- I have no id
ea what kind of a theo ry th at was, but that 
was -- that™s certainly one of 
my earliest memories of going 
to see my father lying flat. 
And it was really from that mo
ment on that he was essen tially -- well, in and out of 
hospital is overstating it, 
but I -- I do rememb er coming home from school and my  
mo ther saying, put -- don™t take off your co
at, we™re going to go see Daddy, who was 
once again in the ho
spital, always with his head flat 
on the -- on th e -- on the wh ite sheet. 
My mo ther was always cooking diet for him.
 I think one of the -- one of the perh aps 
mistakes my mother made in 
her very, very lovely relation 
with me is to use me as a 
friend to c -- to -- to co -- to 
have headaches with and to comp
lain of my father™s illness, 
which stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think. 
Q: So your -- your re
lationship to your father never be
came as close as
 your relationship 
with your mother? 

A: It was not -- my relationship to my father 
was one of regret, that I was not responding 
adequately to the affection he had for me. I 
understood that I was not responding, and I re 
-- I was sorry for him. So was a g -- and my 
-- th-the man in my life was my Uncle Paul, 
who was then -- 
Q: Not your father. 
A: -- seven years younger than my  mo ther, who 
lived with us while he
 went to the -- to 
study at the -- at medic -- at the school of 
medicine, a -- ma -- University of lon -- of 
Vienna, and lived with us and read stories to 
me and played the guitar for me  and told  me 
about things like -- I remember th at he had 
a professor called Professor Tort -- I mean, 
Professor Death, and he told me about -- I --
 I can™t think of the 
word now, hypo -- hyp --

hypnosis. I mean, here I was in my  -- about 
seven years old, learni
ng these fascinating 
things from my  uncle, who would sit by my  beds
ide and tell me -- tell me -- tell me about 
the world. 
Q: Right. Was your father jealous of Paul? 

A: My father wooed me. He wooed me by ta
king me out for ice cream, and my  mo ther 

had told  us not to have ice cr
eam, it would spoil my  lunch. It was always something the 
matter with what -- what my  poor father di
d. I have a curious memo ry around the 
Christmastime and Vienna was full of -- of Chri
stmas things. My father said, I™ll take you 
across the street to look into th e toy sh op, be
cause it has a Father Christmas there, a Santa 
Claus. And I said, I™ve already seen it. And I st
 -- to this day I regret not giving him the 

satisfaction of being able to -- 

Q: To take you. 

A: -- give me something th at I mi ght enjo
y. These are -- I mean, th e -- in fact, my 
relationship to my father seems very vivid, 
but it is not a -- not a -- it is always a little 
sad. And of course, he became very ill. As 
soon -- when we -- when we came to England 

-- one of the chapters in my  book is called ﬁT
he Alienﬂ, and what it™s about is my  father 
being ill in a foreign country.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know wh at it™s like if you™re
 not home and you have a cold? 
Q: It™s terrible. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

A: And here he was, being ill in a w -- in a 
world -- you know, he was -- he was supposed 
to be the one who knew  English, but when  we
 came to a -- I™m -- I™
m jumping to the next 
chapter -- 
Q: It™s okay, right. 

A: -- but wh en we came to England it wa
s my  mo ther who promptly learned the 
language, who managed to do all the things
 that needed  doing -- my father, who was 
incapacitated, only partly
 because of his illness. 
Q: So did he know 
English in Vienna? 

A: He knew  English, but he didn™t 
know it when  he got to England. 
Q: England. But he -- so did you learn so
me English as a kid, befo re you left? 
A: I did, es -- I -- we had English -- 
English lessons in clu -- in school. 
Q: In school. 

A: Which I don™t think that did very 
much except introduce a couple of -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- of words, which always seemed to me 
very peculiarly spelled.
 I went around saying 
pictooray. How can that be picture? 
Q: Pictooray [indecipherable] 
A: It makes no sense. Picstooray. 

Q: Right. 
A: [indecipherable]. But then 
when Hitler came, my
 cousin Inga and I were sent to a 
young lady, a young English la
dy who struck me as alien  
for two reasons. She was not 
Catholic. It struck me. I understood, I le
arned that she was somethi ng else, she was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
9 
 
 
Protestant, which seemed to me very peculiar, 
because in -- in -- in -- in the other people, 
the other world in -- in -- in Vienna was Catholic.  
Q: Catholic. 
A: And the other thing is that 
when my friend, my cousin I
nga and I came outside to go 
home, outside they waited for 
her -- her -- her boyfriend, who was a nats -- an SS man. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you like school when
 you went, as a kid? 
A: You know, I reme mber loving school, but wh
en I think back of it, I™m not so sure. I 
reme mb er wh en  my  ch ild
ren were small and I would go with them or pick th em up and I 
walked in to the school, I had a real yucky fe
eling and I realized, did I really like school? 

I™m not so sure. 

Q: You™re not so su re. 
A: That™s for sure. 
Q: So what do you re -- what do you rememb
er about it? Do you remem -- did you like ta 
-- 
A: About school? 
Q: Yeah, did you like teach -- 

A: Oh, I was -- I was -- I was -- I 
was the good -- I was a good student.  
Q: I imagine. 

A: I was a very good student and I was a prig. 
I remember the first time I talk -- well in -- 
in -- in a Viennese school -- let me tell you ab
out the Viennese school. You sat at a desk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
10 
 
 
in pairs and you had your hands like this. I have
 to show it. Yeah, I know that, yeah. Like 
this. 
Q: Like that, right. 
A: Your thumb was undern eath the desk an d 
your hands were -- I don™t know what they  
thought you would do with 
your hands if you let them loose. God knows. 
Q: You had to stay like this? 
A: You had to stay like this. It seems impr
obable, but that™s what I remember. And you 
did not talk to your person s
itting next to you. Oh, and if
 you misbehaved, you had to 
stand next to your desk while the lesson went 
on. If you were really bad, you stood in th e 
corner. The famous you 
stand in the corner. 
Q: Right. 
A: Is that a concept in America --  

Q: Yes. 
A: -- standing in the corner? 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Well, we stood in th e corner. That hard ly
 ever happen ed though.
 But I once spoke to 
my -- to the child sitting next 
to me about some practical th
ing, like do you have a pencil, 
and the teacher said Lore, stand up next to 
your desk. And I stood 
up next to my  bed an d 
I howled. My virginity had be
en ruined, I was no longer the 
person who had never stood 
next to her desk. And the da -- the teacher -- 
my mother said the teacher afterwards said 
to her, I had to si -- make her s
it down, I was frightened that she -- 

Q: She was howling? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
11 
 
 
A: I was howling.  
Q: Did you have lots of friends? 
A: I-I -- I -- I had best friends, yes, I did -- 
Q: Best friends. 

A: -- have best friends, yes. 
My cousin  Inga was my  best 
friend. And a couple of other 
children who had co me. We -- had play -- play
 -- play dates. And one of the children 
actually not in my school, but w
ith whom I had a play date is 
still an acquaintance, is still 
a friend. Now, I ha -- married to a Welsh doct
or, living in England a
nd that is the one -- 
that™s the one lef -- that™s the one pers
on still -- whom I still know from that period. 
Q: Yeah, right. This one -- 
A: Then there was Ilse. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Who was sent to the camp s with her pare
nts, who have diphth eria and was -- was -- 
became deaf and was gassed. And I know that 
because her cousins, the cousins who were 
with them in the camps came out, and my moth
er many years later, they -- they made a 
bakery in -- in -- on Broadway, above -- 
above colum -- Columb ia [indecipherable] 
Hosp ital. 
Q: Univ ersity? Uh-huh. 

A: And my mother was a -- was a -- wo
rked in that -- 
in that bakery. 
Q: Huh. 

A: And my cousin In ga came to England 
early because her father had a -- was an 
importer exporter and had a Lond
on partner, so they came out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
12 
 
 
Q: This was -- this was a mixed sc -- 
A: We are talking -- 
Q: This was a mixed school, yes? It was boys and girls? 
A: No. 

Q: It wasn™t? Just girls? 

A: [indecipherable] only girls, yes. 
Q: Is that typical? 
A: I think it was universal. I cannot imagine ha
ving any school that was mixed. I™m just 
thinking am I -- am I -- no,
 it was -- it was not mixed. 
Q: It was not mixed. 

A: No, no. 

Q: And it wasn™t just Jewish kids, it was a mixed -- 

A: Well, it was Jewish kids w
ithin a week after Hitler came. 
Q: Right. 

A: But that™s -- 

Q: But before then -- 
A: Before that, it -- yeah. 
Q: -- it was -- it was -- 

A: And I remember th at we learned how to
 sew. We made hem stitching. And th -- 
Q: Hem stitching? 

A: Yes, one of the things we learned. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
13 
 
 
Q: So was it -- was it a very different kind -- 
do you know this -- wa 
-- very different kind 
of school than the boys had? Did you -- you ha
d sewing, I™m sure th ey didn™t have that. 
A: I have no -- I have no id ea
 about -- about boy™s school ex
cept through my Uncle Paul. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Which is, of course, a generation, or 
half a generation earlier, who went to the 
gymnasium. 
Q: Right. 
A: Which was a different 
-- different kind of -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- education, yes, I would th ink. 
Q: Was there a lot of talking about politics wh
en you were growing 
up, before -- before 
Hitler comes? Do you hear about Hitler in Germany? [i
ndecipherable] hear things? 
A: Yes, I remember -- I reme
mb er -- now here I™m coming across one of those problems 
that what a -- what -- what I me -- I mean, 
yes, except in my book,
 for instance, I start 
with this event of a dinner where this wa
s discussed, but I™m sure it  was discussed 
constantly. And my  Uncle Paul saying we shoul
d leave. Now, this is 30-something, if I 
remember it. I mean, I™m 
born in thirt -- in ™28 -- 
Q: ™28, right. 

A: I left in ™38, at 10, right? 
Q: Right. 
A: So when does it -- I mean, 
I -- I must have been six. 
Q: S -- the Nazis come in in ™33. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
14 
 
 
A: Th -- ma -- but -- but in Austria, it was not a ma -- ™33 -- 
Q: Is nothi -- it do-doesn™t happen, right. 
A: Is -- y-you know -- you know what the 
political re-realities were? The Spanish Civil 
War. 
Q: That was more -- 

A: Over the radio. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: We got our news over the radio, and I 
rememb er hearing about 
the Spanish Civil War 
and having one of those total 
revelations. There is always war. I suddenly knew as a 
child, there is no place -- time when there isn™
t war. I understood that, because I had seen 

the first W o rld War pictures in my grand -- you know, iv -- a -- postcards with pictures of 

young ladies who -- and -- and messages to so
ldiers. You know, in 
-- in the sort of 
circular -- the -- the oval sha -- the oval sh
ape. And I knew about the first World War, 
and here was the Spanish Civil War, and it came 
to me that war is one of the things tha-
that -- that™s -- that™s al
ways there in the world. 
Q: Did th at scare you? 
A: And what -- horrified me, as a -- and it was 
one of those real-realizations that -- that 
stays with you for life. But I do remember 
my  Uncle Paul saying, probably  not that 
realistic, because he didn™t do it either, we s
hould all leave. And my father making fun of 

him, saying what do you mean leave, where ar
e we going to go? Going 
to  go  to  
the jungle 
and eat coconuts? And I said to
 my mother, what is go -- and I had that -- you know, that 
-- that -- you know that feeling that the -- the --
 the release of gall into your -- into your -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
15 
 
 
I don™t know how you can feel gall in you, 
but that™s the -- that™s the experience I 
reme mb er. And turn ing to my  mother and sayi
ng I -- what -- what™s going to happen? Is 
there going to be a war? And my  mo ther 
said no, no, no, no, don™t worry. And my  
thinking, okay, I won™t worry. 
I™m just going to not worry
, cause I don™t know how to 
worry. The problem was, when
 you™re a child -- or not -- 
when you™re a grown-up too, 
somebody mentions a calamity, 
and you kind of believe it,
 but how do you imagine it? 
What -- what is it going to be? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: What™s going to  happen? Wh o™s going to 
do what to whom, you know? So, let™s not 
think about it. 

Q: But for you, you did write a sh -- a l -- 
a -- before the book, 
I think, on ﬁOther 
People™s Housesﬂ, where you start talking 
about every -- no, it™s something else, but 
everywhere around you is calamity. Wh en
 you -- when  you realize when  you had 
children -- 

A: That™s the end of it. 

Q: Yes. 
A: That™s actually the last -- the last -- yes. 
Q: It™s the last -- the last lin
e that there™s a calamity all -- 
A: The -- the -- the thing that I think se -- 
Q: -- surrounds. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
16 
 
 
A: -- that seems to me
 something that came to me as a 
result of hearing about the Spanish 
Civil War, th-the end of my -- my book says I™m 
-- at th e moment -- in a moment of -- of 
-- of peace. I have a husband, I have children -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- my mother is here, nobody is sick. It 
feels like a -- an island, the season of -- of 
peace in the -- on an island, surrounded by calamity. 
Q: Surrounded by calamity. 
A: And by that I mean  it isn™t calamity -- 
it™s not only the calamity -- the -- a political 
calamity -- I mean death is -- is a cala
mity, it™s the final calamity, so -- 
Q: Right. Right, right, right. 

A: -- yeah, there are no -- 
there are no good outcomes. 
Q: Right. 

A: But that was -- that 
was a very, very early -- 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: -- it™s a -- was a very early understanding. 

Q: Your mo ther didn™t work  wh en you were a kid. 
A: No. 
Q: Wi -- before -- before she came to England -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- right? But was -- she was a musician? 
A: She went to the music academ
y in Vienna, was a talented -- talented pianist, but of -- 
not -- not -- not in th e grand -- in the grand s-style.

Q: What does that mean? 
A: I mean, she was not going to  be a concert pianist. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: She wa -- she was a -- did not like to perfo
rm, but there were -- there was a piano in 
our house and -- and she wa -- she practiced. 
She had th-this imagination of -- I mean, 
there is alw ays -- there was always practici
ng going on. In fact, I remember her playing 
Chopin and say -- an-and -- and I s -- I used to 
sit and listen, and I thought this was really 
something else, this w as [ind
ecipherable] lovely. And my  mo ther would say, Chopin is 

nothing to Bach. And I thou
ght, oh Bach -- I didn™t
 know what Bach was. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I don™t know which of 
those things Bach was, but Bach  -- I took -- I took my  -- 
my -- my taste 
from my mother. 
Q: So you like Bach? 
A: You che -- I like Bach 
better than Chopin, I -- 
Q: Still? 
A: -- didn™t re -- oh yes. 
Q: Yes? 
A: Oh, I™ve go -- I mean 
I -- yes, I caught up. 
Q: You caught up and -- 
A: Yes, I think -- I think pretense is someti
me s a very good teacher, because you -- if you 
say Bach is better, then you begin 
to listen to Bach, and you say hm. 
Q: Hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
18 
 
 
A: But i -- it takes you years to catch 
up with your -- with your phony -- 
Q: Right. Did your mo th er
 teach you piano as well? 
A: She did, it was a disaster.  
Q: Why? 

A: Well, because I -- I didn't  want to practice. 

Q: You didn™t want to do th at. 
A: I -- I did eventually take 
piano for quite a time and became a reasonable proficient, but 
the fact that I no longer remember a note is a 
sign that I was really not -- that was not my 
-- you know, I thought at one point I was goi
ng to be a painter, I was going to be a 
pianist, I was going to be a -- oh, I wa
s going to be a -- an ice -- ice skater. 
Q: Really? 
A: But actually I was a writer. I w as always
 going to be a writer [indecipherable] 
Q: You were always going to be a writer. 
A: Once I settled down to that one. 
Q: Right, right. Was your house very religious? 

A: Not at all. I find it interesting that my
 grandparents, my mo
ther™s parents, my 
Hungarian born gran dparents di
d not have any notion of Yidd
ish and had absolu tely no 
relation with -- with the ortho -- orth -- I-I m
ean, the Orthodoxy is 
just too far away. I 
don™t think my  par -- grandpar
ents would have known wh en 
the Jewish holidays were.  
Q: Hm. 

A: My mother™s family. Howe
ver, my  grandmother would not eat ham. She served it to 
us, but wouldn™t eat it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

Q: Interesting. 
A: Whereas my  father™s parents, who had died
 by the time my mother married, ow -- h-he 
was -- came from Pressbou
rg, one of those places that 
was Hungarian in language, but 
became Czech by the time the 
first World War was over. I gather that they were 
Orthodox, or that there was -- you know, ev
erybody you talked to
 had -- everybody™s 
father or grandfather was chief rabbi of so
mething. Well, mine were too, except I™ve 
never -- I™ve never follow
ed through on that. 
Q: So you™re not sure. 

A: I™m not sure, but I th -- I™m sure they were
 religious, and that my father said to my 
mo ther, we are going to have a kosher house,
 we™re going to have a religious house, and 
my mother said like -- lik
e how? And then  there™s a sort of
 a nasty story. This is one of 
the nasty stories, that my  father asked my  
mo ther to light Shabbas candles and she did, 
and then he took out a cigare
tte and lit the cigarette on the candle, and Mother said -- my 
mother -- 

Q: That™s the end.  

A: That™s the end of that. That was the e
nd of her. An d yet, she would say the Shema 
with me every night. 

Q: Every night? 

A: Every night. I -- I mean at some point
, I -- I was made to say the Shema by my 
mo ther. I don™t understand it. An
d we did spend the high holid
ay s in the synagogue, but it 
was a synagogue that was created only for th
e high holidays, it was really a -- a Jewish 
restaurant. And I think -- that™s w h at I remember.

Beginning Tape Two 
Q: You went to Hebrew classes? 
A: Yes, God save the [indecipherable] 
Q: When -- 

A: He-Hebrew classes are famously unsuccessful. 

Q: Really? 
A: I went to two Hebrew classes, one in Vien
na, and one in -- in the 
f -- my f -- in -- in 
Guilford and they were both terrible. Why are 
they so awful? The 
wa -- I -- I remember 
the one in Vienna mostly becau
se there was a naughty boy ther
e, and I made it my job to 
inform him. I did not do a good job. My j
ob at reforming him and telling him not to clap 
the -- you know, to keep opening and closing th
e -- the -- the -- the lids of the desks, and 
sitting still. It -- it didn™t work, but I also re
member absolutely noth
ing I learned there. I 
did not -- I was supposed to learn the -- the 
-- the Hebrew letters, and it™s gone. I mean, 
there™s nothing left at all -- of this at all. 
I just reme mb er this being unsuc -- unsuccessful 
teaching. And that -- 
Q: And you™re trying to keep  
this bad boy [indecipherable] 
A: I was -- I was going to reform him, yes. 
Q: Reform him, yes. You have th at in you, right? 

A: No longer. 
Q: No lo nger 
A: It™s gone. I got tha -- rid of that. 

Q: Oh, that™s good. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
22 
 
 
A: Those were my wild 
oats, reforming little boys. 
Q: So why do you th ink your mo ther
 was having you do the Shema? 
A: I cannot imagine, because sh
e was very disappointed in me
, in her old age, because I 
became fascinated by Hebrew texts. I ha -- w
ith my -- with my dear
 friend Jules Harlow, 
Rabbi Jules Harlow, translated the -- wrot -- 
did the translation of the wa -- the book of 
Adam to Mo ses, which was published by [ind
ecipherable]. I mean I -- I did -- I -- I -- I 
now attend a -- a -- a monthly Genesis semina
r. My mo ther is very disappointed in me, 
she really had -- she was a genuine no
n-believer and thought this was all a 
[indecipherable]. So her, in 
my  childhood, making me say the Shema is a my stery to me. 
Perhaps my father wanted it. It™s 
one of those things that has no -- 
Q: Was this very uncomforta
ble for you because you -- 
A: Not at all, no. 

Q: -- not at --  
A: No. 
Q: -- it wasn™t.  

A: It was okay. 
Q: No, it was all right. 
A: I mean, I had my -- I had my
 bath and said the Shema. 
Q: Did you say the -- the Shem
a in bed, right before -- 
A: Said the Shema in bed, 
I -- as I remember, yes. I al
so  remember that those high 
holidays that we spent in -- in  the -- in the synagogue, I reme
mber sitting with
 my mother 
upstairs with the wo men -- mu st have been a s
ynagogue. It mu st have been a synagogue. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
23 
 
 
Q: Must have been a synagogue of some kind if you [indecipherable] 
A: And downstairs I remember my father w
ith his prayer -- with 
the sh -- what do you 
call it, the -- the -- 

Q: The tallis? 

A: With the tallis, doing the -- 
that -- that curious, that to 
me very curious
 bobbing up and 
down . I rememb er being allowed to go ou
t with the other ch
ildren wh en we got 
obstreperous and w-w-we -- there were -- there were some stairs and there was a little 

boy and I who made a lot of 
noise clattering up and down th e stairs and co -- and -- and 
sliding on th e banisters. The shamas came
 and gave us a bad 
time and made us go 
outside, and that™s -- those are th -- my memori
es of that. Oh, and we had Seders and the 
Seders were always -- my father actually, I wa
 -- think very tenderly of my father sitting 
patiently at the head of
 the table, doing wh at he was supp
osed to do as the leader of the 
Seder and everybody else making fun. My  -- my
 Uncle Paul would put the parsley, th-the 
-- the bitter herbs into his la
pel. My mother would come 
down the [indecipherable] and 
make a line and top them up and ma -- and ma
ke a summation. I mean, was a -- it was a -
- it was a g o od joke then. And I always, of
 course, spilled the red wine. Always -- 
Q: Always. 
A: -- spilled the red wine on the white tableclo
th. Every time, yes. Th
at was my thing for 

me to do was to spill the red wine. 
Q: But not on purpose. 
A: Not on purpose, no. 

Q: But you would sp ill it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
24 
 
 
A: Every time, as I remember, yes.  
Q: And that™s tough to
 get out of the white tablecloth, isn™t it? 
A: And that was my  degree of my  Jewish education. 

Q: So, th is place that you went to that wa
s a synagogue sounds lik
e it was Orthodox, but 
you wouldn™t know, right? 

A: I wouldn™t know. 
Q: Because of the separation of men and wo
men, one would think that it was in s -- 
A: Oh, but wasn™t that 
[indecipherable] I think -- 
Q: It™s Conservative as well? 

A: I™m not su -- I wonder whether there were 
in Vienna in 1935, Re
form synagogues? I™d 
-- 
Q: You think you [indeci
pherable] I don™t know. 
A: -- would they -- I mean you would k
now more about it th
an I. I don™t know. 
Q: No, I don™t know. 

A: I -- I really don™t know whet
her there was any such  thing. 
Q: I don™t know.  
A: I -- I -- 
Q: I -- i-it™s maybe even Conservative -- 

A: -- am now very much in doub
t that mu -- it must have be
en a synagogue. I think it -- 
only that we didn't go there, except on the high holiday s. 

Q: Right. 

A: That I thought it only existed on -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
25 
 
 
Q: Existed on the holiday. 
A: -- I think that. I -- I -- I -- that -- that seem
s to me a more reasonable explan ation than  -
- than -- 

Q: Now, for those people who may watch th
e interview, who don™t know what a Shema 

is, could you explain wh at the Shema is? 

A: No. 
Q: Oh, you don™t -- 
A: Well, it is the one -- isn™t it the sort of daily prayer? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And that™s about as mu ch as I know about it. 
Q: Do you remember
 it? The Shema? 
A: I don™t. 

Q: You don™t. Did your mo
ther translate it for you? 
A: No. 
Q: No. She just to
ld you to say it. Shema Yisrael -- 
A: Eloheinu echad. 
Q: Yeah, that™s part of it -- 
A: Then the elohein --  

Q: -- there™s a [indecipherable] 
A: -- there™s an eloheinu echad [indecipherab le] 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: No, I don™t know it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
26 
 
 
Q: And how long did yo
u say this? Did you -- 
A: As long as I was at
 home with my  parents. 
Q: In Vienna. 
A: In Vienna. 

Q: And that -- not later.  

A: Well, there was no later. There was no later. Afterwards we -- we sta -- we spend a 
little time in Fischamend with 
my grandparents. I have no pa
rticular memory, but I would 
have thought that that would be an even ing r
itual that would contin
ue. Then, when we got 
thrown out of the Fischamend house, I had to
 go and stay with a friend because there was 
nowhere for us to live. An
d from then on I went to -- 
on the Kindertransport. 
Q: Right, and so  you [indecipherable] 
A: Lived for only four 
months with a Jewish family. All 
the other families I liv ed with -- 
Q: Were not Jewish. 
A: -- were not Jewish. 
Q: Right. So when you went ba
ck with your parents, with your
 mother and father, that™s -
- that was -- 
A: My father had died -- 
Q: Died -- 

A: -- my -- and I was then with
 my mother ma -- the f -- I 
lived with my mother for a 
little while in London where we sh
ared a -- an apart-apart --  
Q: Right. And then sh -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
27 
 
 
A: -- a -- a room while I went to
 the university. Then 
she went on to join
 the family in the 
Dominican Republic. 
Q: The Dominican Republic, right. 
A: I then joined them, those -- m-my grandp
arents and uncle had ab solu tely no relation 
with -- 

Q: Right, right. 
A: -- with Jewish performance. But I had a litt le time of being Orthodox in the first -- 
with the Cohens. I loved it. 

Q: You loved it. 
A: I really liked that. 
Q: Well, we™ll get -- w e™ll get to that in a -- in a second. 

A: But it™s also -- it™s -- 

Q: It™s -- 
A: A-And then I come back in 
my -- in my -- in my 
-- in my late life to a -- a real -- real 
fascination with the texts. 
Q: And just -- 
A: I™ve gone to Talmud classes, I -- 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. I mean, superficially. 
Q: Yes, but it™s interesting -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- that there™s such a move. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
28 
 
 
A: Yeah. So mebody asked me the other day,
 one of -- one of the many things you get 
asked, give me your seven -- seven favor
ite books, right? The Bible. Grimm™s Fairy 
Tales. 

Q: Right. 

A: But the Bible comes first, as literat
ure, you know? So, what can I tell you? 

Q: But as a kid growing up, 
there™s very little connection -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: In -- in Vienna. There™s these strange 
kinds of connections, but no real knowledge 
with respect to what this is, so y
ou don™t even know what the Shema -- 
A: Only  one thing.  

Q: Mm-hm? 

A: A friend of mine, Ruth Gay -- I don™
t know -- you probably know her wo rk. 
Q: I do know the name, yes, yeah. 
A: Yeah. Ru th Gay once said to me, did you 
have any non-Jewish fri
ends in Vienna? And 
I -- I thou -- I looked my  -- I thought the kids with whom I played -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- that were chosen for me 
to play with, or the people 
who visited my  parents, none. 
Q: None. 
A: None. Not a one. There were no non-Jewish 
members of the social
 world in which we 
lived, either -- either in my at -- at -- it™
s -- in  -- at my age, or at my parents™. 
Q: So, not even close 
friends in the school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
29 
 
 
A: No. And that was not by any -- any o-orde
r by any by-law or by any choice, just who 
would you invite home, or who 
invited you home, these were al
ways Jewish children. It™s 
very strange. 
Q: But maybe not so strange in a society that 
really had a segregation to it, that you as a 
kid can™t help. 

A: But the segregation at school was self-segregated. 
Q: Self, uh-huh. 
A: We were -- there were cr -- I mean, it 
was a regular wa -- regular public school. 
Q: Right. 
A: And it was not a particularly Jewish dist
rict, so there would be many different -- the 
wa -- it was not a je -- a Jew -- as it turned out
 later, it w as not a Jewish schooling by any 
means. 
Q: Right. 
A: Very strange. 
Q: And your neighborhood was mixed? 

A: Mixed, totally mixed, yes.  
Q: Totally mixed. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And did you live in a house,
 or lived in 
an apartment? 
A: Lived in an apartment build
ing that was four flights high.
 It was a block th rough con -- 
it consisted of one, two, three -- three or 
four -- fours floor highbuild ings separated by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
30 
 
 
yards, by square yard s, and there was a pa
thway -- a -- a -- a g -- a -- a way through from 
one end to  the other.  
Q: So there was an inner courtyard? 
A: There wer -- there wer -- there were two inner courtyards. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Probably  two inner courtyards. Maybe it™
s four -- four inner courtyards, probably, 
yeah. 

Q: So did you have 
a room for yourself? 
A: I did not. It was -- no, there was a -- you kn
ow, wh en I went back in 1938 with my  
husband, we went up to the apartment and 
I rang the bell and the wo man who lived in it 
put the ch ain on and wouldn™t let me in. But 
my husband™s -- a-a-and I said, you know, I 

reme mb er the geography. Now, I think this is 
pretty interesting. We don™t realize that 
what makes the impact is not the color of th
e walls, not the quality of the furniture, but 
the geography. You walk in, th
ere™s a bathroom here, but the kind of bathroom that™s 
only a toilet. There™s the kitchen here, the ma
id™s room -- the miserable maid™s room o-on 
-- beyond it. There™s the [indecipherable].  Th
ere™s a thing called this gas castle. I don™t 
know, it was a ga -- it was a big piece of -- of 
-- of -- of furniture inside which I suppose 
was some kind of the ga -- ga -- 
I don™t know what -- what to -- 
Q: Gas? 

A: I am going to  leave this. I can only tell you 
was called the gas -- the -- th-the thing that 
contained the gas. And then over here is th
e door that leads into
 the Herrenzimmer, which 
is the equivalent of the living ro om. Next door
 is the -- the dining room with a table so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
31 
 
 
huge that there™s only a gangway around it, ex
cept my mother™s piano 
is in there, so my 
memory is clearly not as effi
cient. And then there™s my pa
rent™s bedroom. And then -- oh, 
th-th-the -- the f -- the front -- the -- that foyer 
is L-shaped, leads to my  parent™s bedroom, 
and the -- and th e -- and the bath room here. 
And there, very ofte
n, one of the uncles 
stayed. My -- I had my Uncle 
Paul, or my uncle -- my -- Mi
mi, my father™s brother. And 
all my grand -- my parents slept in the -- in th e -- in the -- that room, and I slept in the -- 
in the -- in the living room with a -- a be -- 
a bed put up for wh atever uncle was sleeping 
there. When  my  ca -- parents had guests, whic
h happened fairly often, they would -- I 
would be put to bed in my  pa
rent™s bedroom because they  would use the living room as a 
part of the -- of the -- of the events of th
e evening. And I would listen to the fun and 
games, the telling of jo -- I-I think my parent™s 
social life de -- consisted of telling jokes. 
So here would be people sitt
ing around this big table, 
and there would be one voice 
speaking, and th en ev erybody 
would burst into laughter, 
and then  would be an other 
voice. And I was trying to listen. And I had this
 notion th at they put me to bed early. I™ve 
checked this out with children,
 my grandchildren for instance
, do you hate going to bed? 
Yes, because that™s w h en all the fun starts. 

Q: You listen -- right, right. 
A: Do you remember that? 

Q: Yes, absolutely. 
A: You think that they just getting you 
off to bed so they 
can do their thing. 
Q: Thing, right. An
d you would listen -- 
A: Especially when there 
were people there, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
32 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: So -- 
Q: So did you hear the jokes? 
A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- but I remember the jokes that -- when th
ere were no guests there, or -- or when I 
was not in bed. Those jokes I wa
s sent out of the room for.  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I mean, there -- there were jokes that 
I was allowed to listen to, those were the 
bathroom jokes. 

Q: I see. 

A: And then I guess there were others. 

Q: That you were not allowed to listen to. 
A: Which was a waste of time sending me out, 
I wouldn™t have understood them anyway.  
Q: Right [laughter] 
A: That was a total waste. But there were 
those jokes also. Bu t mo st of the jokes of 
Viennese -- of the Viennese class of
 my parents were bathroom jokes. 
Q: Bathroom jokes. 

A: Bathroom jokes. But, well there™s a -- a --
 I™m reminded of my  grandchildren, all of 
whom go through th e poopy -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
33 
 
 
A: -- poopy jokes. I think th ese were poop
y jokes. I don™t know what else they 
[indecipherable] 
Q: But they were adult poopy jokes. 
A: Adult poopy jokes.  

Q: Right. 

A: And then  there was a whole class of joke 
that were about Graf Bobby, o-or -- or -- 
what is Graf in -- in -- is it Duke Bobby? Th
ey were Jewish jokes about the aristocracy, 
about the -- the -- the -- the -- 
the shabby -- the shabby po -- 
you know, the -- the -- the a-
aristocracy that had lost its power and its -- 
its m -- power mind by intermarriages and so 
on, and so th ere were Graf Bobby jokes. 

Q: But this was about Jewi
sh acris -- a-aristocracy -- 
A: No, no -- 

Q: No, it™s everything -- 
A: -- it was the Jewish joke about the -- 
Q: -- about -- 

A: -- about the -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- about making fun of the aristocracy. 

Q: I see. [in d ecipherable] 
A: I™ll tell you one joke. 
Q: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
34 
 
 
A: Graf Bobby and his best friend Tony are 
sitting in the park and -- poopy joke -- and 
the little bird poops on Graf Bobby™s hat. An
d Graf Bobby takes off his hat and tells -- 
and asks his friend for a little piece of paper to
 wipe it off -- oh no, he -- he starts wiping 
and his -- his -- his friend give -- oh, that™s 
it, his friend gives him a little piece o f his 
newspaper and Graf Bobby says, because of 
that I™m not going to  climb up on th e tree. 
To wipe the behind. 
Q: To wipe the -- 
A: That™s -- that™s a typical joke.  

Q: This is -- is a typical joke. 
A: Yeah, yes, that both makes fun of [indeci
pherable]. And interesti
ngly, th e Graf Bobby 
jokes traveled with us to Engl
and. So one Graf Bo
bby joke would be Graf cha -- Bobby is 
now a pilot and is coming to bomb  London. And 
he goes back to Vienna with th e load of 
bombs still in his plane, and his -- and they
 say to him, how c
ould you -- don™t you 
understand how dangerous it is 
for you to land? Why didn™t 
you drop them over London? 
And Graf Bobby says, because as -- just as I 
arrived the all clear we
nt off. They™re Polish 
jokes. 

Q: They™re Polish, right. 
A: They™re Polish jokes, but it™s maki
ng fun. I mean, 
it™ s a Jewish --  
Q: Who is Graf Bobby? Wh at does that mean? 
A: Graf Bobby is a universal aristocrat. 
Q: I see. 

A: And what the -- what the Jewish jo ke is saying is they™re all fools. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
35 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You have to make fools of people -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- who -- who don™t let you join  their club. 

Q: Club, right, right. Do you rememb er your 10
th
 birthday? 
A: Yes. 
Q: 1938. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Was that significant? 
A: I remember particularly because my -- my
 dance teacher was inv
ited and I had a crush 
on my dance teacher.  
Q: Oh. 

A: Steffi Stile. I don™t know whether she came 
or not, but that™s really all I remember. I -- 
I also remember getting a -- getting a -- a turt
le, but I don™t know whether that was the 
ninth or the 10
th
 birthday. And this turtle would not 
do anything but sleep, until it was put 
into the bathtub with 
a little bit of warm water, and then it went. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, I remember my turtle. 

Q: Was a teeny turtle, a little one? 
A: No, a [indecipherable] 
Q: Oh, it was a big one. 

A: Wonder what happ
ened to my turtle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
36 
 
 
Q: Oh, you didn™t take it with you? 
A: I -- I can ™t remember what -- that mu -- no. 
Q: No [indecipherable] 
A: That, I -- you know, I believe this, in 
70 years is the first ti
me I wondered what 
happened to that turtle. 

Q: To your turtle. 
A: I don™t re -- I -- 
Q: Did you name the turtle? 

A: No. I just remember 
its -- its boringness when it wasn™t 
in a -- in the ba
thtub with the -
- 

Q: Who gave you a turtle? 

A: My mother, maybe
 [indecipherable]  
Q: Was -- it™s interesting, why a turtle? 
A: I mean, that was th
e only an imal we had. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: We didn™t have a dog, we didn™t ha
ve a cat in -- in -- in -- in Vienna. 
Q: In Vienna people didn™t have animals. 
A: I had a bird. I had -- 

Q: You had a bird? 
A: Yes.  
Q: What kind of bird ? 

A: It was a yellow canary with a hair st
anding up so that it was cal l ed Schopfel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
37 
 
 
Q: And that you had -- 
A: And it was -- it had a re -- a relationship 
with my Uncle Paul, 
cause whenever my 
Uncle Paul wanted to  study 
with his book open, Schopfel wo
uld sit on the -- on the -- on 
the page and he would do a sort of a -- a loop across his page.  

Q: So he was -- 

A: It was a very in -- and it was a very im
portant memb er of the family, the Schopfel. 
Q: And so you -- 
you had the --  

A: I had a turtle and a bird. 

Q: -- and the bird. An d you had the bird at a younger age. 
A: Yes, he was there. The -- the -- 
Q: There was a long -- a long time [indecipherable] 

A: -- the bird was there a long time. 

Q: You liked the bird? 
A: Ah -- 
Q: Do you remember? 

A: I was interested in the bird. 
Q: You were. 
A: He -- he -- he also liked to take -- you 
know, he was a bird to tell stories about. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: There are people and their animals. And one
 of the things he did was to pick up a 
noodle, a long noodle and drag it acro
ss the table. He was a nice bird. 
Q: Really? So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
38 
 
 
A: And he flew around, yeah. 
Q: Yeah, he wasn 't necessari
ly in the cage all the time. 
A: I guess not. 

Q: I guess not.  

A: It -- you know, th is is the trouble with history. 

Q: Right. 
A: I remember the fun parts, but I don™t remember -- 
Q: Right, not the bad parts. 

A: -- the factual. I want to k
now what happened
 to my bird. 
Q: You don™t know what happened to the bird
, wh at happened  to -- and did they  have a 
relationship -- 

A: And the turtle. 

Q: -- your bird and your turtle? 
A: None at all. 
Q: None at all.  

A: No, I don™t -- I -- I don™t think the tur
tle had mu ch in -- had mu ch  going for it. 
Q: No, it sounds like it was in too small a 
place, before you put it in the tub -- 
A: No, it was wa -- what do you mean? It was 
in the -- in the livin
g room. I mean, it was 
walking around the apartment. 
Q: Oh, it wanted water. 
A: Maybe so. 

Q: I think. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
39 
 
 
A: It wanted warmth or something, yes. 
Q: Warmth. Warmth and water. 
A: I guess so. 
Q: I don™t know. 

A: But those were the only two pets. My gran
dparents had a cat, but in -- in Vienna we 
only had the bird and the ha -- and the turtle. 
Q: Did a -- mo st people had no animals that
 you knew. The Jews that you knew had no 
animals?  
A: I don™t think so. 
Q: Uh-uh. Now, only a few days after your 10
th
 birthday, the Nazis come in. 
A: Right. 
Q: And then Hitler comes in on the 15
th
, so the -- 
A: 12
th
. 
Q: Is it the tw -- 12
th
 -- 
A: As I remember -- 

Q: -- right. Ri-Right. 
A: -- the 12
th
, yeah. On the 12
th
, my  parents had again visitors
, but these visitors were not 
the kind that I was segregated
 from. They were my cousin
s ea -- I tol -- mentioned my 
cousin Inga. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And she and her parents came. And my  mo th
er and my  Tante Ann -- by the way, I say 
the animals you tell stories about
 and Tante Erna was a person you told stories about. Sh e 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
40 
 
 
was the foolish aunt who -- it™s not worth telling 
those stories, but -- but that™s -- that was 
her -- her purpose in life was to make ma -- 
give -- give my  mo th
er stories to tell. 
Q: But you have one stor
y th at you tell about her for that night, right? 
A: Y-Yes -- 
Q: The night when sh -- 

A: -- well -- well, one of the stories was my mo
ther used to tell that aunt -- Tante Paul -- 
Tante Erna would co me and pick
 up her skirts and says, let me
 see your ne -- do you have 
new pants -- panties on? That was one of the st
ories. It may not be true, but that was -- 
that was a Tante Erna story. Oh , I tell you one 
other Tante Erna story, wh en she gave my  
cousin Inga a new doll for her birthday, she 
kept the box and wrap
ped the box again in 
tissue paper and put it on top so  that the doll 
wouldn™t get dirty. That was another Tante 

Erna story. A true Tante Erna story. 

Q: That™s -- that™s a tru e one.  
A: That™s a true one. 
Q: So -- so -- 

A: She wasn™t -- 
Q: -- your cousin  never played with the doll. 
A: No, because it would get -- it would get dirty. 

Q: Right. You had do
lls as a kid, right? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Were they important to you as dolls? 

A: Unsatisfactory. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
41 
 
 
Q: Unsatisfactory.  
A: Yes, that™s -- 
Q: Why? 
A: Can™t remember. T h ey were always promis
ed more than -- than
 -- they were not 
babies, I think. Th-Th-They  were just do
lls. I can™t remember being particularly 
enthralled. 
Q: Did you want a sister or a brother? 
A: Yes. Yes. I asked my mother for a sister or brother. And I think after awhile she said, 

well you know, Daddy is not well. We -- we w
ouldn™t have a -- i-i-i-it™s not a good idea. I 
wa -- I wasn™t -- I was not persuaded by this 
argument. I did -- that™s why I -- you know, I 
showed you the picture of my  parents when  
they took me into th
e Alps, they provided 
some little kid to
 play with -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- to make up for this li -- brother or sister I didn™t have. 
Q: Right. 

A: Unsatisfactory, totally unsatisfactory.  
Q: Right. And her explanation 
didn™t work for you either. 
A: No, I -- I kept wishing. I-I wish to th
is day that there was a -- a -- a -- somebody 
who™ll remember the same things that I remember. 

Q: Yeah. They don™t remember the 
same things, that™s the thing. 
A: No? That™s -- 
Q: They remember 
different things.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
42 
 
 
A: But the -- oh, the -- 
the evening of the 12
th
, I think there mu st have been th at 
expectation of calamity, of a mi -- of -- of
 real calamity, immedi
ate calamity. My Uncle 
Paul was there -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- and I reme mb er them -- I -- I mean, I don™t know wh at was in the newspapers, I 

reme mb er my  Uncle Paul calling a friend of hi
s who was a journalist, and being told not 
yet. So there mu st have been in
 th -- i-it -- it must have be
en abso lutely obvious what was 
going to  happen. And in  the middle of the me al -- we had the radio on in  order to f -- to 

keep in to uch with what was happening, 
and they stopped the-- the -- they stopped 
whatever was going on in the radio and Schu
schnigg, the -- the ka -- cha-chancellor gave 
his goodbye speech. Now, I quo
te it in my book and it™s -- 
it™s -- it shows what a bad 
scholar I am that I didn™t look up what he act
ually said. I mean, it is easily r -- it™s on the 

records, but I -- I put down what I remembered
, which is only partially true. And after he 
had spinish -- the speech more 
or less said, I wish my -- my
 -- there™s going to be a 
change in -- in regime and I wish you all a 
bearable future is the way I rememb ered it. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then they played for 
the last time, th e Austrian 
National An them, and my  Tante 
Erna said to my mother, they™re playing it sl
ower than  usual. And my  -- and my  mo ther 
said, it™s the -- it™s probably th
e same record they -- they 
always used. And Tante Erna 
said, Franzi, you, a mu sician, you don™t hear 
that they™re playing it slower than  usual? 
And my mother said, Erna, you are a cow. Y
ou don™t understand wh at has just happened  
to us. And Tante Erna said, Ernst, my  coat. This
 is what she has said to me, this is what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
43 
 
 
she calls me. My mother said, please Erna, I am
 sorry, we are all th -- you know, in this -- 
in this th -- your wo rld had just stoppe
d. Yo -You -- you -- yo-you™re going to  be -- 
probably  be -- likely to be dead
 in  the next year and here you are, the nerves are acting in 
this -- in this human way.  
Q: Right. 

A: And Tante Erna an
d Uncle Ernst left. 
Q: They did leave? 

A: They left. But of course, they come back 
into the picture, becau
se they are the ones 
who have the contact with London. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And they  were the ones to wh
om I sent my letters to help
. So they are make -- play a 
big part in this. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Let™s stop the tape. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

Beginning Tape Three 
Q: Do you reme mb er your mo th
er calling Tante Erna a cow? 
A: Clearly, yes. 
Q: You -- you were sitting there? 

A: Oh yes, yes, I was sitting there. 

Q: Were you shocked? 
A: I can™t remember my reaction, but I do re
memb er watching my  mo ther trying to  take it 
back -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- and apologizi
ng, and the apology not 
being taken -- a-accepted. But I at that time 
was already cla -- clearly aware that Tante Erna 
was the butt of jo -- not the butt of jokes, 
but the butt of stories. 
Q: Right. 
A: So I al-already understood th at. 
Q: Right. 

A: That she was a comic character
 whom one told stories about. 
Q: Right. It™s a very interesting use of the wo
rd cow though, that -- th
at your mo ther uses 
it -- 

A: [indecipherable] kuh. 
Q: -- [indecipherable] just kuh is just stupid. 
A: Erna [indecipherable] kuh. It sounds better in German. 

Q: Were you at that moment aware that 
something was going on
 now in Austria? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
45 
 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: You did. 
A: Oh yes. But of course that
 event, that little -- 
little interplay with Er
na [indecipherable] 
kuh -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- it -- it didn™t lighten it, but it gave one
 -- it™s almo st like giving you -- giving you 
time to breathe before you were fu lly in 
it, bef -- let me  tell you something wh ich -- 
which may be irrelevant, but I once watched 
a shooting from my  window on 77nd Street. 
I looked -- I happened to be looki
ng town -- ah, down and -- from the 10
th
 floor and a 
man came running out, holding his hand -- ar
m like this, which was bleeding. And I saw 

somebody -- two people running away and 
the man was yelling for the police. And I 
called my  husband to  come and watch, and we
 stood an d we watched this. The man went 
back inside, he came back outside. It took 
some five or 10 minutes before the police 
came, bef -- all of a su dden there were a mass
 of people standing around, something had 
happened. I™m always been inte
rested in the gap in time be
tween what happened and the 
world™s reaction, or even one™s own reaction. 
And that al -- I always connect that. I mean, 
it may be very far fetched, but I always co
nnect that with that -- the b -- the axe has 
fallen, but th -- a -- a time -- th-th-there™s a ti
me in which you don™t 
know what to do with 
it. 
Q: Right. And you d
on™t even notice --  
A: Do you remember in Fa
hrenheit -- what™s his name 
-- shows our president -- 
Q: Bradbury, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
46 
 
 
A: -- sitting with the children whom he was 
being a president for. 
Do you remember? Do 
you remember the scene? 
Q: I think so .  
A: He sits for quite awhile. He™s just been 
told  that 911 has occurred, wh at we now think 
of as 911. 

Q: Right. Ri-Ri-Ri-Ri-Right. 
A: He sits. He does nothing. He does not
hing. The -- you gi -- you see the -- the aid 
bending down to tell him this, and he sits. A
nd then, of course, everything explodes. It™s 
that moment, that -- to be [i
ndecipherable] that™s -- that™s 
what that represents in my 
memory. Before you actually sit up and sa
y, now our lives are totally changed. 
Q: Changed. 
A: We are now in imminent danger, but it does
n™t hit you. You have 
to ha -- you have to 
have that -- that moment. 
Q: Do you -- do you -- were yo
u around when Hitler comes th
rough Vienna, in that car? 
A: I was around. I didn't see him. 
Q: You didn™t see him.  
A: I didn™t see him. B u t mine -- my -- mine 
-- my  next experience is of being taken down 
s -- by my  -- to my  parents on the very next
 morning, going to 
the bank -- you know, 
when  I go back to Vienna, I lo
ok fo -- at that -- at that door 
still. It™s not a bank any more, 
but it was a building that had -- Vienna has 
so-some of the -- the -- the door seems to 
have been cu t off of it. The door -- i-if you 
ha -- you have a square -- I mean, a corner -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
47 
 
 
A: -- but the corner is cu -- is -- is cut off 
so that the door is 
-- I don™t know how to 
explain it, geo -- geometrically, 
but I remember, I still look fo
r that. And we went to that 
door, and the door was locked, 
or in the process of being locked , and th ere were lots of 
people standing out on the -- on the sidewalk
. People trying to  get their money out -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- before -- before it was -- disappeared fo
rever, and we were already too late. I don™t 
know what the financial situation was, but
 we know -- we did 
not get our money out, 
certainly not that day,
 because it was lo
cked. And my -- and there were -- it was a very 
bright day, it was one of thos
e beautiful March -- March days with -- that sa -- the -- I 
always think of the sun in Vienna being wh
iter and cleaner than anything is nowadays. 
Maybe -- maybe in -- in th-the light over the o -- b-by the Great Lakes in -- in wa -- in 
Chicago has some of that light. But it was that
 kind of light and there were flags up and it 
was jolly. And people kept li -- raising thei
r hands. There™s a very, very moving little 
picture, horribly moving, in -- in the m
ovie ﬁInto the Arms of Strangersﬂ where a 
grandmother is trying to get her f
our year old to raise his hand -- 
Q: To raise his hand, yeah. 
A: -- and he won™t. He doesn™t 
know what she wants from him.  
Q: Right. But you -- 
A: But I thought it was very charming, I th
ought it was beautiful. 
And -- and you know, it 
looked very cheerful.
 And my  parents rushed me back
 up home. So wh en you ask me 
what did I know, it™s again one of those very
, very unclear -- I did know, and yet I didn™t 
understand why I was being rushed
 back into th
e apartment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
48 
 
 
Q: So it didn™t feel dangerous to you? 
A: Didn™t feel dane -- in fact it 
felt very gay. It felt very merry. 
Q: So when they took you back 
upstairs you don™t recall you -- 
A: I -- but I certainly understood their hast e, and their -- that they were upset. I 

understand -- underst
ood th at very well. 
Q: You understood th at. 
A: Yes. 
Q: But you didn™t know why. 

A: At the mo ment I did not know why, no. 
Q: Right. 
A: So, at -- th-th -- th-that™s one of the cu
rious things of what 
a child of 10 does and 
doesn ™t understand of that large political pictu re. 

Q: Right. And th ey didn™t sit you down
 and say here™s the [indecipherable] 
A: No. 

Q: -- and why would -- 

A: You know something? It™s so interesting -- 
we -- we talk a lot abou
t what is and is not 
told us. I mean, we are now doing a -- a wrap-
up of -- of an event, 
how -- did I ever sit 
my children -- I happened to have written a book about it. But if I hadn™t, would I have 

sat my childr
en down -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and explained it? 

Q: Explained it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
49 
 
 
A: I mean, explaining the facts 
of life is -- is one of those 
awful things that nobody knows 
how to do. 
Q: Right. 
A: And explaining th e facts of 
history and of politics, is --
 if we don™t -- we don™t -- we 
don™t do it. 

Q: We don™t do it. We don™t do it. 
A: Can you imagine the moment in
 a life? I -- is it after b reak
fast? Is it at breakfast? Do 
you say, wh en you™ve
 had your bath, put 
on your pajama s and I™
ll tell you so mething? 
There is no time. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: We don™t explain things to each other.  

Q: It™s -- it is interesting.  

A: It™s -- it™s -- it™s very interesting --  
Q: It™s very interesting, yes.  
A: -- that th -- we -- that is -- you know, is it 
our culture, or -- or -- or -- or is it just hu-
human that we don™t actually have -- it™s not 
part of what we do, to tell each other, to 
explain th ings.  

Q: Well, especially to children. I-I-It™s as if 
e-either we think that children don™t need to 
know -- 
A: Or -- yeah -- 
Q: -- or they get so -- 

A: -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
50 
 
 
Q: -- they get it anywa -- somehow people get it.
 I mean, often we don™t explain to each 
other, right? 
A: Exactly. I™m really ve
ry interested in this. There™s -- 
I kno -- I know the -- the -- they -
- there™s now a kit that you can get from 
the Smithsonian about 
interviewing your 
relative. But certainly that -- but -- but that™s an
 un -- it™s an un-unnatur
al thing. It™s a -- 
it™s a -- 

Q: It is unnatural. 
A: -- it™s an  artifact. 

Q: And it™s very hard . 
A: Very hard to do
, yeah, yes, yeah.  
Q: Much harder to do th
an someone you don™t know. 
A: I think it is. I -- I did debrief my grandf
ather for my book and I got him to tell me his 
childhood stories. But it was be -- for a purpose
. It -- it w ouldn™t have occurred to me to 
do th at. 
Q: To do it otherwise, yes.  

A: It™s funny, one of the curiosities. 
Q: So I know, when  I ask somebody who is a 
child, did your parents explain, there are 
ways in which I know 
there™s no explan ation -- 
A: There™s no explan ation, yeah . 

Q: -- and yet I want --  
A: -- yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
51 
 
 
Q: -- I w -- I want to know, because maybe 
there was something. But you felt something 
in their bodies. That™s 
-- you did feel tension. 
A: Oh, for sure.  
Q: For sure. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you knew something was wro -- 
A: And you become agitated yourself. 
Q: Right. 

A: I nearly became frightened. 
Q: And you don™t have -- you -- and how -- 
and an yway, how would you understand it 
[indecipherable] really. 
A: I mean how -- what -- what [indecipherable] 

Q: What would you -- 
A: -- yeah. 
Q: So -- 

A: Now, it™s interestin g, when I did ex-explain
, I -- I used that scene 
in my book, be -- the 
conversation between my  Uncle Paul and my  
father. That explains in the book to 
somebody who doesn™t know, what was happenin
g. But I don™t think that was ever -- I -- 
I don™t think that happened. That™s the way a 
writer -- I mean the writers -- the -- one of 
thing -- the first thing writers have to do is to
 introduce the reader to what they™re talking 
about. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
52 
 
 
A: But in life that doesn™t happen. 
Q: You have to create something th at doesn ™t -- 
A: Yeah, you have to  -- you have to i-in -- 
you know, you go to an 
Ibsen play  and in th e 
first [indecipherable] the bil -- 
the beans have to be spilled 
of what you have to know 
before you can start th e story. 
Not in life, you don™t do that. 
Q: Right. So when is the firs
t time that you experienced some
thing that has to do with the 
Nazis, besides seeing the flags and -- 
A: I think that™s it, that was it. 

Q: That was it. 
A: And then  of course, the next thing is 
that at school, in the weeks before Hitler, 
everybody became intensely Aust
rian. And my -- the teacher ha
d made us -- in our class 
we had made posters that said [speaks German 
here]. Red, white, red to the -- to -- to the 
death. 

Q: Wow. 
A: It™s in -- interesting that I suppose there 
was still an assumption, 
at least in my school, 
from the top down I assume, that
 we were refusing to be 
annexed by Hitler. On the day 
we came home after the annexation, they bro
ught big sacks into which we stuffed these 
posters that we had made, very rapidly. 

Q: To hide them. 
A: Because now we were on the other st -- th
-the other side had 
won. And I remember 
that very, very, very clearly
, the teacher tearing down , mak -- making -- and making us 
stuff it and tear it up. And that one of the children said, hey can I take a -- can I take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
53 
 
 
home the one that I made? And th e teacher sa
ying, don™t -- are you a stupid fool? Put it in 
there quick. Some -- some really rude -- rude
 word, and -- and in a great agitation, be -- 
be -- I mean you can™t -- you could ge
t -- you could go to jail fo-for -- 
Q: For that. 

A: -- presumably, for having th at. And the ne
xt thing was -- I don™t know if it was on th e 
same day, but certainly within the next -- with
in the next mo ment of experience, that the 
Jewish children were ha -- were made to 
stand aside the -- i-it wasn™t -- the word 
Christian was not the one that was used, Arya
n. The Aryan children sa
t in the front rows, 
then you left a couple of rows free so that 
there would be no contamination, which I say 
now, I don™t think that was said then. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the Jewish children sat 
in the back. And th e next thin
g that happened was that the 
Jewish -- the Christian children, the Aryan ch
ildren were moved to  a 
different school, and 
my school became ther -- the -- th e -- the area
 school for Jewish children. And the other 
great e-event in those days was that the te
acher who was sent in, not a Jewish teacher, 
who was assigned to teach the Jewish children in
 my class, came in 
-- in an Austrian 
volksschule, in Austrian [ind
ecipherable] the chi -- you behaved very  well. I mean, you 
not only sit with your hands like 
that, but when the teacher come
s in you rise to your feet. 
The teacher told us to take 
out our books -- take your books
 and read, she said. And then 
she went to the window and stood with her ba
ck to us and we could see her crying. You 
could see her -- her -- her shoulders heaving w
ith sobs. And there was not -- I mean, they

fa -- the old cliché, you couldn™t hear a pin dr
op. The effect of a -- of a grown-up crying 
and us all sitting there 
pretending that we were
 reading while sh -- 
Q: [inaudible] 
A: -- bu-but [indecipherable]. I mean, I reme
mber that, I can -- I can -- I can -- I can 
picture it, I can know exactly 
wh ere everybo -- everything was in that room, that was 
such a -- such a -- such 
a -- a memorable moment. 
Q: What did you think 
she was crying about? 
A: Oh, I think we understood. We
 understood that she didn't wa
nt to be -- sh -- it was -- it 
was a demo tion. I don™t know what wa -- 
Q: So it wasn™t the situation, it was her -- 
A: It was a c -- first of all, this was a grow
n-up crying. It was a grown-up crying cause 
she had to teach us. Oh, that was perfectly cl
ear to me. It was clear to me then, it was 
clear to me -- it™s 
clear to me now -- 
Q: Right -- 

A: -- it was clear to me then. 

Q: -- right.  
A: You know, it™s inter -- i-if I were writing th
at, I would have to find some way of -- of 
how a child phrases that to herself. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I can™t do that backwa
rds. I-I mean, I don™t know how 
to do that, but I certainly 
understood it. I think we all understood it. 
Q: And what ha -- wa -- you knew you were 
Jewish. However, you we
re not religious -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
55 
 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- you knew, sort of, you were Jewish, right? 
A: -- yes, yes. That™s a very interesting k -- 
thing, isn™t? How did I -- what did that mean? 
Q: How did you know this? I mean, why didn
™t you think you were an Aryan kid? 
A: No problem -- 
Q: There was no -- 
A: -- no confusion about that at all. 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: Very interesting. I -- I -- I™ve never aske
d my self that question. I -- I don™t know. Bu t 
there was no problem. 

Q: So when the -- when  the Aryan kids 
leave, and it™s only Jewish girls now -- 
A: Only  Jewish girls. 

Q: What do you th -- wh -wh -- does something go
 on in your head  lik
e what the -- what is 
happening, why are -- why -- why are these kids
 leaving, what -- were -- or are you so 
confused to -- 

A: The word Hitler takes care of -- 
Q: Everything. 
A: -- of all of this. Of all of this, yes. 
There are these events, one after the other, and 
they™re all clearly understood. It was clearly
 understood that our maid -- we had -- we 
always had one maid, usually sent us by
 my  grandmother from Fischamend, from the 
village of Fischamend, some -- so me -- some da
ughter of one of the customers, or -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
56 
 
 
she had to leave because j -- Jews were not
 -- because Christians were not allowed, 
Aryans were not allowed. I mean, how did I kn
ow the word Aryan? Th
at -- that -- that -- 
Q: Did you have a relationshi
p with her? Yo u knew her? 
A: You know, I don™t really remember which 
one she was. We always had a girl, they 
never -- did never -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- didn 't necessarily stay 
very long. Not very mu ch, no, 
no. I knew my  grandmother™s 
maids better, when I went to
 stay with my  grandmother. There was somewhat a 
relationship. I don™t think th ere wa -- 

Q: Did she live there? 
A: She -- there was -- 

Q: There were -- 

A: -- th -- [indecipherable] the kitchen -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and there -- there was a -- a -- a rotten 
little room behind the kitchen and wh en my  
mother later on in -- in -- in -- in England was the cook, she said to 
my father, this -- di-
did we really make our maids sleep 
in a room like that? Shame on us. 
Q: Shame on us, right. 

A: Serves me right. 
Q: Now the rule in Germany, I don™t know wh
at it was in -- in Austria, it was what, Jews 
could not have maids under the ag e of 45. 
A: I don™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
57 
 
 
Q: Only  over 45. 
A: I don™t think -- I don™t think that was -- 
Q: That was poss -- 
A: If it was, I -- I would -- didn™t know. 

Q: You didn't know. 

A: I do remember -- and I rememb er it now, th
at my  father would not acknowledge the -- 
the presence of a maid. He would look like 
this. If the maid was wa
lking this way, my 
father m -- I could remember -- I remember 
my father sort of, 
you know, edging away 
from the co -- from the air contact -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- with this foreign body, yes. 

Q: That™s interesting.  

A: But I remember how -- she didn™t wait at tabl
e, but she brought stu
ff in and took stuff 
out. My  mother did the cooking.  

Q: Uh-huh. And did she do the -- 

A: For the longest time we had not a ma -- 
liv e-in maid, but a woman called Frau Raizy, 
who had a little boy called Eric who would come 
and play with me under the piano. And 
when I went back to Vienna I looked up Er
ic and we went to vi
sit his mother. There™s 
that wonderful story which is useless to te
ll because it a -- it only 
works in German. My 
mother said something to Frau
 Raizy, that she should do 
something that -- Frau Raizy 
was quite small and had little raisin eyes, th
at she should do something about that. And 
Frau Raizy said, [speaks Germ
an here]. Now, a shass is 
a fart. And the only way to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
58 
 
 
translate th at is, in that -- if 
-- if -- if Madam wants me to
 do that, she has just stepped 
into my fa -- a fart. She has -- the fart has entered -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- it™s -- but it™s more, the fart has entere
d her -- her sole of her foot like a splinter. I 

me -- there™s no way to do that. And my  mo th
er, who was about to get up on her high 
horse, put her back head and roared with  laughter. And from that on, the two women 
were very good friends and in fact Frau 
Raizy took some degree of care of my  
grandparents. Her hu -- her husband was 
a -- was a -- was a -- was a Communist. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And she -- she took some degree of care of my -- of my -- 
Q: Interesting. 

A: -- she bought them food. 

Q: So if you played  under the piano, it mean
t you had a grand piano 
in your house. Did 
you have a -- 

A: We had a baby grand. 

Q: You had a baby grand. 
A: No, I think -- is there something between 
a baby grand and a grand? Because I think it 
was bigger than a ba -- I have a baby grand 
at home and it seemed to me that piano -- 
Q: A little bit smaller. 

A: -- was longer than that. 
Q: Yeah, there is. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
59 
 
 
Q: Sure, cause they™re different -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- you know, there™s [indecipherable] 
A: And it was a Blutner. 

Q: It was a Blutner? 

A: Yeah, I have to -- 
Q: Yes, it™s very good. 
A: -- I have to di -- spell that. It w as a Blutner, yes. 

Q: That™s a  good piano.  
A: And underne -- it was fun playing with Eric
. And I -- I -- as I said, I -- I looked up Eric 
an-and the conversations were 
not very -- very satisfying. 
Q: They were -- they weren™t satisfying? 
A: No. 
Q: So school changes. 
A: School changes, my f -- our maid has to 
leave, and I don™t remember what her name 
was. 
Q: Right. 
A: I™m surprised that there was a maid becau
se -- because it was really Frau Raizy who 
had been our cleani
ng -- cleaning help. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But there was a maid. I reme
mber that, that she had to le
ave. And my father lost his 
job, and cou -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
60 
 
 
Q: And do you rememb
er your dad lo -- losing his job? 
A: I remember that he no longer went -- 
Q: To work. 
A: -- to the office. I remember
 once my  mo ther taking me to pick him up at the end of a 
day, we were going to go pe
rhap s do so mething or other. An
d it was extremely grand. It 
was one of the baroque banking houses, and 
I remember my father
 coming down  a stair. 
This may be an imaginary memory, but there it is. And I reme
mber saying to my father -- 
we are going back to my -- to 
the early -- I say ing to my fath
er, what is it like up there, 
what -- and my father didn™t ha ve enough imagination to answ
er me. He just said, oh, I -- 
I sit and I write numbers. Unsatisfactory. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I wanted to -- I was as
king a novelist™s question. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Tell me what it™s like so
 that I can imagine you. 
Q: Likes -- right. 
A: You know, that was -- I -- I 
get back to that in a bit. 
I always needed -- I wa -- I 
wonder whether mo -- all childre
n need to have a -- a mi se-e
n-scène. You need to know 
how to -- if you want to 
think of your parents -- 

Q: Right, right. 
A: -- or anybody, you need
 to s -- you know -- 
Q: You have to have a picture. 
A: -- where they are. You have
 to  have a picture, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
61 
 
 
Q: Right, yeah
, yeah. Yeah. 
A: My father was unable to -- 
Q: To create that. 
A: My Uncle Paul could do this, you see. 

Q: Right. 

A: But my a -- father was never able to do that. But he was fi
red, and I know th at he got a 
certain amount of mo ney. What would you ca
ll the money that you get when  you -- wh en 

you are dismissed from a job? 

Q: I forget. But there is a -- there is a -- 
A: There™s a -- there™s a severance pay. 
Q: Severance pay, right. 

A: Severance pay. The reason I remember it, be
cause at that point also, now I have -- I™m 
not going to tell you how I thi
nk our apartment was taken from us, because I do think that 
is imaginary, I really don™t re -- there were
 too many years I did not
 reme mb er how that 
happened . I just knew th at we had to leave,
 and that we then went to live with my 
grandparents in the house in Fischamend. 
And I remember my father saying to my 
grandfather, what I should do is put
 my  severance pay in to the shop. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my m -- grandmother saying -- turn ing 
to my  mother and saying, your husband is 
a s -- is a fo ol -- my husband is a fool, your 
husband is a fool. You™re going to put money 
into a shop when 
the Nazis are going to take it away fro
m us? I mean, it is so -- there is 
that, knowing and not knowing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
62 
 
 
Q: But she knew. 
A: She knew -- 
Q: She knew something. 
A: -- that my father -- my father had just 
been thro wn  out of his apart -- job and his 
apartment and he™s going to  put it -- what are 
we -- what -- what does the human head do 
with these facts? But I mean, 
of course the aw -- aw -- Germ
an Jews had been doing that 
since ™32. 

Q: Right. 

A: Hanging in there, thinking 
it was going to go -- all go away. 
Q: And isn™t it human that if you move
 to another place, they™re not here. 
A: Oh. 
Q: So, it™s safe. The -- so geography seems to protect you. 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Or at least you want to believe it. 
A: Yeah, right.  

Q: But what did pe -- I mean, sh
e said this, she clearly was -- 
A: She understood it. 

Q: She understood it. 

A: I mean, she -- they all unde
rstood it, but she faced it. 
Q: Right. 

A: She looked it in the eye. 

Q: Right. And did your mo ther face 
it in a similar way, do you think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
63 
 
 
A: Don™t know. 
Q: You don™t know.  
A: I don™t know. My  Un cle Paul certainly did. 
Q: He did. 

A: My Uncle Paul arrived one
 day from the Univ ersity of
 Vienna from which he was 
about to be thrown out. He was a medica
l student who had screwed around being a -- 
being a Socialist, being a poet, you know, doi
ng all these things, not getting on with his -- 
with his studies. And he came out with his ea
r lacerated, cause he got into a fight, from 
which time on he stayed out in Fischamend, 
which -- which I loved, because I loved to  
have him around. Then there co
me  the, you know, the series of events I -- I -- I don™t 
even know how to put them 
chronologically. There is a -- a September. There is a -- no, 
how could it be a September? We had left 
in August. There is a -- w h at I remem -- 
Q: You left Vienna in August of ™38, right? 
A: We -- we -- no, we -- 
Q: Or is that -- 

A: -- left in  mar -- in April. 
Q: In April to go
 to fishen -- 
A: To Fischamend. 
Q: Right. 
A: April, May, in -- within
 months of Hitler coming. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
64 
 
 
A: April, May, June. I -- I can™t -- I -- I mean
, I -- I really can™t do it. I -- I don™t -- it was 
re -- I know that we were back
 in Vienna in August, so -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- sometime before then. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I know that I lived for several months 
in Fischamend, and that my  Uncle Paul -- 
Q: Was there. 

A: -- was my teacher, taught me there because I 
could not go t -- I ha -- I could not go to 
the -- th -- to the village sc
hool because it was -- because I 
was Jewish. Now, the village 
school was of course the school wh ere my  
uncle and my  -- Uncle Paul and my  mo ther 
have gone as children. 

Q: Mm-hm. How old is your Uncle Paul? 

A: My Uncle Paul was -- 
Q: About. Is he in his twen -- 
A: -- seven -- my mother -- I can only do th
is, my  mo ther was born ™04 and Paul was 
seven years younger, so he was -- do 
th e arithmetic, four plus seven. 
Q: Four plus -- 

A: Oh 12? Six --  

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- 11, yes, 1911 -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- when he was born.

End of Tape Three

Beginning Tape Four 
Q: Lore, when you were in Fi
schamend, were there Nazi kids
 -- were there young people 
who were Nazi supporters? 
A: Oh, I would think universally, yes. My -- th
ere were the kids that my Uncle Paul and -
- and my  mo ther had gone to school with, who had -- you know, had been  -- been anti-

Semitic, but it didn™t amount to  very much. I mean
, my mother used to 
say that they had a 
-- a --a game that was called the old bird  selle
r. And th e old bird seller was a Jew, and my  
mo ther always had to  be the bir -- old bird
 seller, and -- and she was disappointed cause 
there were other -- other parts like being bird
s, or being somebody else that she would 
have liked . But it didn™t amount to anything ve
ry much until -- you -- you see, this is to -- 
seems to me so interesting about this wh
ole thing. On e understands meanness of many 
kinds, one understands anti-Semi tism or ra
cism, but you have to wait for a -- a -- a 
regime that not only  permits but mandates th
at meanness and that racism. And then you 
get hell on earth. These young -- these young pe
ople were just auto
matically mean, anti-
Semitic people until Hitler came. And then there was the day on which they put ladders 

up ag ainst the windows of my  grandfather™s hous
e and walked in -- came
 -- first they s -- 
they sat on the windowsills, and 
then they came in and help
ed themselves to whatever 
was in the house. These were the age group 
of my -- of my -- of my -- my mothers and 
uncles -- they had gone to school together, or th
eir -- or their -- or their children, or their -
- or their younger brothers and sisters. 
Q: So they™re in their 20™s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
67 
 
 
A: The people who -- who wrote Kauf nich t bi 
Juden, don™t buy from the Jew, in red -- in 
blood colored letters o n  the outside of the house or on the windows, and across the street 
and across the pavement, those were all the 
people that my -- my parents -- my -- my 
uncle a-and my  mo ther have grown up with . 
Q: Did this frighten -- cause you -- 
you™re sitting in -- in a house -- 

A: Oh -- 
Q: -- was this frightening finally? 
A: You know, lots of people ha
ve asked me -- have compla
ined about my book, that it 
seems to be so cool and I can only  -- only sa
y yes, that it is -- e-everybody waits for the 
expression of -- of horror, and I -- it™s there, 
but I can™t -- I can™t bring it to the surface. 
Q: Right. 

A: Some psychological damage, or some -- I m
ean, I -- I -- I refuse to
 put it into words if 
it isn™t there in the feeling. 
Q: Right. 
A: But it certainly is missing. What is the 
reaction? You know, we™ll come across it when 
-- when -- when we talk ab
out my leaving home. Where 
-- where was the -- where was 
the -- th-the depth, th-the -- the intensity? I don™t know where it is. 

Q: You don™t know where it is. 

A: I don™t know where it is. I 
remember being horrifi
ed when they -- th
e nats -- t h e young 
Nazis came and took my father 
an -- the men, my  father, my  uncle and my  grandfather to  
the police station, and I -- to beat them up, 
I think is too -- too st
rong a word, but they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
68 
 
 
certainly smacked my father 
and broke his glasses. And th
at shocked me. That -- that 
seems to me -- 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: It shocked me in a sense that I have a 
-- a memo ry of having seen  that, wh ich I could 

not have done because it was 
done at the police station. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I reme mber being frightened  because my  
bed had to be pushed way up against the 
wall away from the windows be
cause they kept throwing st
ones until all the windows 
were broken. I mean, that must have terrified 
me, and yet terror is not -- is not what I can 
come up with in memory. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: That™s a -- some kind of failing -- a failu
re of -- of -- of response on my part. 
Q: But let me ask you something. When  you we
re younger, before all of this started, how 
would you describe yourself 
emotionally as a kid? Were 
you very restrained? You™re 
somehow treated as an 
adult by your mother -- 

A: Yes, yes -- 
Q: -- because of the inadequacy
 of the relatio nship, right? 
A: -- yes, yes, yes. 
Q: So do you th en somehow feel as
 if you have to exhibit a certain -- 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I did not feel that it was require
d of me to be brave. That™s not -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
69 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- that™s not at all what it is. It™s a habit.
 It™s almost like some
body preparing to be a 
writer. Let me observe this. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Let me see how this looks, how this opera
tes, rather than a gut a-anger, or gut grief. 
And I can™t answer the question because I™ve 
certainly thought about it, and I don™t know 
how it work s. I don™t know how my  emotions or
 my responses operate,
 I just don™t know.  
Q: Now, le-let me -- then let me ask you the 
people around you, beca
use it -- it sounds as 
if you™re taking stuff in as opposed to givi
ng it out. You -- you -- yo
u want to get a sense 
of what the circumstan ces are. What is -- 
what™s happening with your mo ther, with your 
father, with Paul? Are they reacting in a 
similar way, that -- that you can remember? 
A: I watched -- I watched that awful wo
nderful -- wonderful awful movie, ﬁMrs. 
Miniverﬂ the other day. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: They seemed to react in a cool fashion. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: As if you watch what™s
 happening, you -- you know, 
you -- you -- you deal with 
things as they come, your
 house has just been -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- broken up. 
Q: Right. 

A: I think it™s -- it was -- I wonder 
whether that isn™t how many people -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
70 
 
 
Q: Reacted -- 
A: -- in fact go through -- 
Q: -- yes. 
A: -- I think we -- when we look 
for the high drama, I think we
 are thinking of literature 
rather than -- 

Q: Rather than human -- 
A: Human [indecipherable] 
Q: And your mother in -- in 
the movie, ﬁInto the Arm™s of Strangersﬂ, said something 
about herself. ﬁI just -- e-essentially I went 
with whatever happened . I could deal with 
whatever happened.ﬂ So it wa
s -- she didn™t sort of dwell on the fact that -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- now she was going to  be a cook, or now she was going to  be a maid. 

A: You do what -- what -- 
Q: What has to be done. 
A: -- has to be done. And I think th at™s 
how -- my  father, it seems to me, was hanging 
onto himself. I have a vision of him looking 
as if he was trying to  not throw up. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: He was co -- so concerned with staying 
on his feet, and not being -- coming ill again, 
that™s what -- that™s what he was up to. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then, you know, there were things -- 
i-in the -- the extreme reaction is not one 
that I remember -- any of us. It is curious, is
n™t it, because it™s almost
 as if the reader or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
71 
 
 
the hero longs for some -- some -- the reaction 
to disaster, and here is disaster happening 
all around you. 
Q: On the other hand, if you react too much, 
you cannot then act in -- within the context 
of the disaster. 

A: Maybe so. Do you remember that fam
ous photograph which is -- all -- wa -- 
something I carry almost in 
my head, of the little boy in the middle of the group of -- 
Q: Warsaw. 

A: -- th -- yes. 

Q: With his hands up, yes. 
A: Now, wh at is the reaction of those peop
le? They  look horrified, but nobody is howling 
and screaming.  
Q: Right. That™s right. 

A: I have one other s -- answer to this ques
tion. When my mother 
and I were flying from 
the Dominican Republic finally, to
 New York , we were in a plan
e. It started fra -- in -- in 
the Dominican Republic. It was fu ll of Domi
nicans and my  mo ther and me, and it was 
one of those horrible flights wh ich goes all a --
 which seems to descend or fly all the way. 
And all the Dominicans, ay, mamita, ay [i
ndecipherable]. And my  mo ther and I were 
sitting there with our -- with 
the white knuckle, holding on, 
saying not a word. And then 
the plane would steady up and I rememb er th
ere was one toothless woman who turn ed 
around kind of shamefacedly an
d grinned at us. And then th
ere would be another drop, 
ay, mamita, a didi -- Dios mio. There is the -- 
is there a d ifferent reaction that -- that you 
expect o-of yourself, or I -- it is a puzzle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
72 
 
 
Q: It is a -- it™s -- 
A: It™s a puzzle. 
Q: -- it is a puzzle. But I have the feeling that
 -- that often the resp
onse comes much later 
with people. 
A: Yes, it comes in terms of my not being ab le to bear to go to the movies in which 

there™s going to  be a minimu m of respo -- of -- of suspense.  
Q: You also wrote somewhere -- maybe it was in
 the introduction to the -- the novel, that 
you don™t actually like being in th
e movie theater, in the darkness. 
A: I don™t like it. I™m afraid -- I™m afraid 
it™s going to  bother me, it™s going to put me 
through something. 
Q: That you don™t -- 

A: I mean I k -- when  somebody in a movie 
once again goes into an
 empty room to look 
through somebody™s desk that they™re not su
pposed to go into, I close my eyes.  
Q: Cause that™s -- 

A: I -- there is -- I -- there™s a -- there™s a 
danger here. I mean, I know nothing™s -- I been 
there -- I™ve seen that scen
e many times. I cannot bear -- 
Q: You™ve [indecipherable] 
A: -- I mean, I -- I -- I™ve -- well, cannot bear
, I find it excruciatingly uncomfortable and 
unpleasant to be in a situation of -- of -- 
of danger. I lie in bed -- now my -- I have a 
wonderful bed. My  bed, if I look out to th e right, I look all the way down  to the Empire 

State Building. I look over to the Empire Stat
e Building and I think, 
look, it™s still there. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

A: There™s no war on at the 
moment. That™s, I think, what
 has happened. But screaming 
and crying and howling at the time did not happen. 
Q: At the time it [indecipherable] 
A: Did not happen. 

Q: What -- what -- wh-what you see, in 
terms of the rest of your life is -- 
A: Is a m -- 
Q: -- i -- is this -- there is a -- ther
e is a danger that™s alw ays present -- 
A: Yes, yes, yeah. 
Q: -- which is not present in man -- in -- in people who haven™t been through stuff. 
A: Is it not? I know people -- I -- you know, I™m
 -- I™m eager not to 
claim emotions for 
those of us who™ve been thro ugh 
this experience that are not un
iversal. I really want to be 
careful not to do that. 
Q: Mm-hm, right, right. 
A: There may be -- there may be more -- mo re 
expectation of -- of disaster, of calami ty, 
which is the last 
line of my  book. 
Q: You mean, in more people? 
A: Ye -- in more -- mo re in me th an in most
, but I suspect it is not -- it™s not a sp -- it™s 
not a specialty. I mean, it™s -- it™s -- I 
think it is a human -- human experience. 
Q: But it™s a human experience within the contex
t of experiences that are -- that match in 
some ways what you™re talking about. 

A: Yeah, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
74 
 
 
Q: That where people have experienced external 
dangers, that they ho
ld -- that they can™t 
get rid of, because how can you get rid of it? 
A: I -- yeah. I will also tell you that any time 
I™m supposed to go on 
a trip, including to 
Washington, I have a -- a week bef -- it is 
preceded by a week of
 having every illness 
under the sun. So, you know, it 
-- it plays itself out somehow. 
Q: In some -- in some other way. 

A: I get a cold, I get diarrhea, I get -- I ge
t dizzy. And then  I™m on the train and I™m 
having a lovely time. So
 it™s there somewhere. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: It™s -- it™s -- it™s gone underground and take
s its place a-at -- in a -- it is -- comes up. 
Q: And I don™t know if it™s not a rhetorical 
question to say, what did you feel at that 
moment, because I -- I don™t know. 
A: I have no answer. 
Q: I know. Yeah. 
A: I was certainly frightened, but I 
was not out of control frightened. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I left -- when I left my parents in 
Vienna, I was not out of control unhappy. 
Q: Right. 
A: I did something else, I was sa
ying wow, I™m going to England. 
Q: England, right. You have to 
leave Fischermund [indecipherable] 
A: -- ermen d . 

Q: Fischermend. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
75 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Does everybody have to leave?
 Does your -- your grandparents? 
A: As I remember it, and I 
think this is correct, my gr
andmother, who wa
s persona non 
grata, because she had a big mouth, as we sa
y, she had expressed he
r -- her irritation with 
the customers when -- who came into the -- into the -- into 
the -- loudly. My Uncle Paul, 
my  father and my  mo th er and I had left. I don™t know -- no, my  mother and my  

grandfather stayed behind. Well, let me just 
say wh at happened was that they backed the 
-- backed a -- a truck against 
the door. By the way, Obam
a -- Barack Obama the other 
day used a f -- a simi le which 
-- which -- which was wonderful.
 He said, wait til the -- the 
Republicans back their garbage 
truck ag ainst the door and du
mp it. And that called up the 
truck -- 
Q: Truck. 

A: -- that the Nazis pulled up ag ainst my  grandfather™s house, and emptied it out, and 
then made him sign a gift to the vinter -- 
vinterhelfs fund. The Winter Help Fund. And 
it™s es-essentially emptied the store out of 
-- of anything th at was saleable, and it got 
closed down. 

Q: Hm. 
A: And after that -- that was -- after that -- you 
know, here -- here is the sort of -- first of 
all the blood red wo rds on the wall. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Then one -- my  grandfather™s assistan
t, a young man, came up one day on some 
message, on some trumped up message and fo
und us listening to  the radio, the o -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
76 
 
 
forget wh-what the -- I-I mean, so
 it was what is now radio-free Europe, but I forget what 
it is. Think it was British broadcasting -- 
Q: Was maybe the BBC. 
A: -- I don™t know, but we were listening to it
 and he found us liste
ning to it. The next 
day one of Paul™s old room -- colle -- sc
hoolmates came up and demanded the radio for 

use at he -- at Nazi headquarters. I mean, th
ere™s several events lik
e that. Then there was 
the Hitler rally, which happened 
right outside our ha -- store,
 because the store was on the 
-- on the main -- main square. There was a 
big pole, on top of wh ich was mo unted a 
radio, a loudspeaker that broadcast the whol
e -- in the environment. And there were all 
the young people in their Nazi 
uniforms, including my grandf
ather™s shop assist ant Mitzi 
who was my -- who was my best friend, I though
t. And my mother kind
 of -- my -- I -- I -
-I want to say, hi Mitzi -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- and my  uncle pulled me into the room and ca -- and closed the door.  
Q: [indecipherable]  

A: And then came that really drastic event of 
their walking i -- up the ladders and into the 
-- 
Q: Into the apartment. 

A: That kind of intrusion, that kind of 
-- I mean it -- it -- yeah
, you™re -- you™re coming 
into my house. 

Q: Right. 

A: You™re invading me. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
77 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And -- and then the stones -- the -- the st
ones throwing that broke every window, and 
then the -- the stores closed, the men are taken to
 the police station, I think th at is mo re or 
less. And then we have to go and my  -- I thi
nk they -- they asked my  father, or ordered 
my  grand -- my  grandfather and my  mo ther
 to stay and fi -- close up the shop. 
Q: And then  -- and -- and so  then you le
ft to go back to Vi
enna in August -- 
A: We left to go back to Vienna, of cour
se nobody having anywhere to live because 
they™d taken our apartment. 

Q: Taken your ap artment. 
A: And we were kind of divided up. I was sent 
to stay with a -- in th e book I make it -- in 
this book I™m -- I™m at pain
s to -- to m-muddle up who -- who was who, so that -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- out of -- out of some kind of probably
 unnecessary tact. But my grandmother went 
to live -- grandmother and grandfather let -- we
nt to live with one 
of my  grandmother™s 
many sisters. She had 15 
brothers and sisters. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Of whom only three survived. All the othe
rs ar -- were killed in -- then, including 
Tante Frieda, whom they went to stay with. 
Q: Mm. 
A: Let me just say something about that. Th
ere was a mo vie once on television, I can™t 
even remember where we were
 and which -- which disaster 
we are talking about, but one 
of the wo men who was being asked to -- take
n on some -- some death march, was hugely  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
78 
 
 
big, like my  Tante Frieda, who had an abso lu
tely lovely, lovely  face, but was obese, and 
that now, if you want to know when I di -- 
when I fell apart, at -- w atching -- it wasn™t a 
movie, it was on the television, that™s when I 
we -- fell apart. Because I tried to imagine 
my Tante Frieda -- 
Q: Walked. 

A: -- being walked on a two day walk. And th
is women in the -- in
 the [indecipherable] 
died. Died [indecipherable] becaus
e she couldn't walk. That got me. 

Q: Right. 

A: That got me. But anyhow, I was taken to liv
e -- to stay with a g -- a friend of mine, a 
school friend. My father went to stay with
 his brother Max, Mimi. I don™t n -- Paul, I 
think went -- my Uncle Paul went to stay with
 his -- with his friend Dolph, I think. That™s 
-- that™s -- that™s how I reme
mb er it. Eventu ally my  grandparents found a house in the 
Jewish district, the sec -- zweiter Bezirk, 
the second [indecipherable], and then  my  
parents went to live with him. And the last 
day before I went on my Kindertransport, I 
stayed, I think one or two 
nights with them there. 
Q: Did you have any sense that this
 Kindertransport thing was coming? 
A: I had no idea, all I knew is
 that everybody of the Jewi
sh community talked literally 
about nothing except emigration.
 You know, it™s so interes
ting wh en people ask us why 
we didn™t leave. Now, what -- what -- I me
an, the sensible ques
tion is why didn™t you 
leave before it came because you had every re
ason to know it. But 
why we didn™t leave 
then, nobody wanted anything except to le
ave. Our ac -- occupation was going to -- from 
one consulate to the other. Ou
r -- learning hand sk ills, the one -- the kind of skills that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
79 
 
 
you n -- you -- that you could earn  a living if
 you didn't know the language, my  father 
made little -- little -- m-miserable 
little leather purses. My father and mother went to learn 
machine knitting, knitting on -- 
on these mech anized machines
. My mother learned large 
quantity cooking, what do you call it, yeah
, cooking fo r many people. They  learned 
Swed ish massage. My Uncle Paul let -- went 
on -- on a Hakshera w
ith people who wer -- 
wanted to go to Israel to learn farming, to
 learn -- yeah, farm -- farm -- farm, do farm 
work . 
Q: Right. And who™s providing th
ese classes? Jewish community? 
A: I should imagine it™
s the Kulturschemand -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- the Jewish cultural organization, I would imagine. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: At least the -- the -- the -- 
the f -- the Hakshera, I™m sure 
that they -- they were doing 
it. The rest I think peop
le just found -- found -- 
Q: The places. 

A: -- the places. At this point it wa -- became
 you -- it -- it -- little b y  little what you co -- 
were allowed to do shrank. You couldn't go sh
opping, you couldn™t 
-- th-these were the 
times when people were hauled out -- my  a 
-- my  Uncle Paul™s second wife was hauled 
out of her house and made to
 scrub the sidewalks. That 
was a common thing, you would 
look --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- you would see people -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
80 
 
 
Q: Did you see that? D id you see that?  
A: I don™t think so. I think I see my Au
nt Susan do it, but I don™t think so. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I don™t think I saw that personally, no.  

Q: Did you n -- did you n -- do you rememb er 
noticing that the streets are different, that 

there™s some -- th-there™s something r
eally different here than that -- 
A: Oh, well, firstly you -- 
you were -- you were told to 
hurry home. If you went to 
school, you hurried home. And then of cour
se, the big event was -- it was Kristallnacht. 
Q: Kristallnacht, yeah. 
A: When  they told us at school
 to go home very quickly, a
nd we said why and they say, 
just go home very quickly.  

Q: So you did go -- wh en you we
nt back to  Vienna in August, school starts in September, 
or -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: And you did go to a Jewish school then ? 

A: I went to the same school that I had 
been  -- that had been
 made into the -- 
Q: Right.  

A: No, I went to a different Jewish school. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Because I was living in a different -- in a di
fferent district. Yeah, that™s right, I wa -- I 
was now living -- I was no longer living in Jo
sef Stetter strasse, I was living -- I forget 
where my  friend lived, but it was a different school district.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
81 
 
 
Q: Right.  
A: So I went -- I mean , I now see that I 
remember, I see a different class, a class 
differently -- 

Q: Arranged. 

A: -- arranged. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And the different tea -- it was a male te
acher. I don™t really reme mb er who the -- who 
-- I don™t -- anyway, after -- after 
the event of the teacher cryi
ng, I have no more memory 
of that school. Maybe it was because we left v ery soon afterwards.  

Q: Left soon, right, right. 
A: But the school afterwards, there was a ma
le teacher. And we were
 told to go home 
quick ly, and that was th -- a very great dram
a because the Nazis came. Th-The kind -- th-
the way Kristallnacht played its
elf out in our -- in -- in my
 friends -- in my friend™s 
parent™s house is that all the Jewish families 
who lived in that build
ing -- now, buildings -
- I have a memo ry of a huge building, bu
t m -- there were no huge bil -- there was one 
[indecipherable] in Vienna. My
 mo ther went to take me, it was 10 -- 10 stories high, 
okay? So it was a four -- ba -- mise -- m -- wa
-was not a -- more than -- I can™t imagine it 
was more than four stories high. But what I 
do remember is that th e Jewish families were 
being forced to move themselv
es and their furniture all into
 our apartment,
 the apartment 
of my  friend, wh ich had a bedroom, a livi
ng room and another bedroom. There were 
three rooms in general. Interestin gly, I can™
t place the kitchen, but there was a kitchen, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
82 
 
 
I™m sure. A nd so , by the end of the night the 
furniture that they ha
d brought in -- and you 
know, Viennese furniture is not lik
e this, Viennese furniture is -- 
Q: Big. 
A: -- big. It has to have weight. And when  
you™re left alo n e as a child in your room, it 
creaks. 

Q: It creaks. 
A: It -- it™s -- it -- it is alive and the wood sh
rinks and -- and you he
ar distinct, ghostly 
creaks. Well, this [indecipherable] and -- and 
there were upside-down chairs. There were 
tables with their feet up. There were peopl
e sitting around crying. It was a -- it was a -- 
some kind of a battle scene. 
Not with -- with active battl
e, but something was wro -- 
everything was wrong. Tables 
and chairs are supposed  to have their f -- legs down and 
these were upsid e-down  on top of cupboards
. And the Nazis kept turning the lights off 
and on. I mean that makes of -- the -- the pr
actical jokes against the people over whom 
you have power. The other thing 
that I remember very clearly 
is th at Tante -- that -- that 
my mo -- my friend -- my friend was called 
Dieter, and her mo ther had a brother who 
came at that moment to hide out in our -- le
t me call it o u r apartmen
t. Because they were 
taking men from the apartment he
 was living in  and of course
 walked straight into the 
arms of the -- of -- of the Nazis and was 
taken away. I -- I don™t re -- know -- don™t 
remember the end of that stor
y. What I do remember is th
e following days. It™s such a 
curiosity. I remember one of the 
men, one of the neighbor -- ma
le neighbors, stayed in his 
pajamas and wh enev er there was a ring or a knoc
k at the door, he woul
d get into bed as if 
he could pretend he had some 
terrible disease and then  they wouldn™t take him away. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
83 
 
 
remember this man in the paja
mas playing chess with one of
 the -- one of the children, 
one of the boy children. There 
was just this sense of -- of 
oddity, of pecu -- of -- of a 
peculiar world. And the funny -- a funny consci
ousness on my  part that the man who kept 
pretending he was sick was lying, 
and you™re not supposed to lie. 
Q: There™s that thing 
again. We™re gonna -- 
A: And also I -- that -- that is the -- that is
 one of the times that I do remember crying in 
terror, because it occurred to me
 at that moment I didn™t 
know where my mother was. 
And I do rememb er sitting down and cr
ying and being comf
orted by somebody. 
Q: By so mebody. 
A: I think it was Dieter™s mother, whose name
 at the mo ment I -- her father was Otto and 
he was a -- he became a very dear friend, 
an old -- old -- older friend. He knew I was 
smart and he liked it and he talked to me. He, 
like my  Uncle Paul found th at it was fun to 
talk to me. 
Q: Right. 
A: As I now find it fun to talk
 to my grandson Isaiah -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- who is very clever, at seven. 
Q: We have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
84 
 
 
Beginning Tape Five 
Q: When you were crying, when this -- so
me body came and you -- you think it was the 
mother, it was -- it was Dieter™s -- 
A: I think so . I think so it was. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I remember some of the s -- comforting me 
with a hand, with a vo
ice. Can™t remember 
what they  said, but I rememb er feeling wh at 
you might feel if you sudden ly realized you 

were in a -- in -- in -- in the supermarket 
and you had lost your 
-- you didn™t know where 
your mother was. It was that 
-- it was that experience. It su
ddenly came to
 me I didn™t 
know where she was.  

Q: And that™s what fright
ened -- at that moment? 
A: That™s what -- yeah, that moment, yeah. 

Q: And who knows what 
really frightened you? 
A: Well, the whole -- 

Q: Yeah, the whole thing. 

A: -- I understood th e whole thing to be a -- a -- a mad scene. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Something where ev erything was wrong. 
Everything wasn™t the way it was supposed  
to be. 
Q: Now, is this before Kristallnacht? 
A: That was Kristallnacht. 

Q: That wa -- that was the night at -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
85 
 
 
A: That was -- 
Q: -- that was the night. 
A: [indecipherable]. Now, there were much ot
her stuff going on. There were -- there were 
-- this -- th-there were synagogues burning. 
Q: Right. 

A: A-All around Vienna, but I™m -- I -- I knew th
at later, I did not know that at the time. 
Q: Uh-huh. So it™s you -- 

A: It was not an experience.  

Q: Right, right. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So this was the experience. Now, is it a fe
w days later that you are told that you™re 
going to  leave? 

A: It seems to me it is, yes. I think that™s what mobilized my fathe
r. That this is -- of 
course, happens off-scene -- 

Q: Okay . 

A: -- that my mother wanted -- wanted -- my
 mother -- my parents by -- by this time now, 
moved in with my grandparents, into this 
two bedroom little -- little
 -- little apartment, 
and my mother wa-was just waiting f -- to bri
ng me home. And I think at this point wh at -
- my father -- I mean, this -- 
I know this from my mother™s st
ory, that my fa-fath er said, 
she™s not going to stay here. And then he cam
e to pick me up one day and it was within -- 
it would seem to me within 
the week, within 10 days of 
this, while -- you know, I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
86 
 
 
remember that condition of ev
erybody living in this all --
 I mean, w e-well may b e some 
10 -- some 15 people living in
, with all their furniture. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I can™t remember that -- th
ey didn™t -- never moved out again, so I mu st have moved 
out. My  father picked  me up and said, you™re
 going to  England. And I said, what do you 
mean I™m g o ing to England? 
Y -- we™re going to eng -- he 
said, no, you™re going to  
England. Mo mmy  and I can™t go.
 And he to ok me to a burned out Temp le, that™s the b -- 

that™s -- that™s -- that™s why 
-- and that™s when I knew. It was a round -- a round Temple, 
a circular Temple, and when you walked acr
oss fallen lumber, it was gutted. And there 
were people cleaning it out and then there 
were people that -- pa-parents and children 
hanging out down th ere. And th en there were 
people standing up the stairs and along the 
women™s gallery, waiting to be processed. 

Q: In this bu
rned out place? 
A: In this burned out synago
gue, yeah. And my father and I were called out of line. My 
name was called, Lore Groszmann, and my  fath
er walked me past all these people into 
the office, and there was my uncle ot -- Tante 
Frieda had four children, one of them was 
Otto, who was -- unlike my  uncle, had finish
ed his doctor -- doctora
l studies and was a 
docto r. And he had a girlfriend 
and the girlfriend worked for 
the Kulturschemand, for the 
culture, and she had put my  name on th  -- tha 
-- there™s a complication 
of being in such a 
situation, of having been pu
lled out of line and -- i-it -- I -- I have not grieved over it, but 
I think about it once in awh
ile. Somebody was there because I was there, right?  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
87 
 
 
A: But anyhow, I was told that I was 
going to  go on this -- on -- on -- on this 
Kindertransport. At this point my  next memo
ry is being with my  grandparents and my  
parents in this little, very small ap artment. 
A nd my -- I remember the evening before my 
departure, which was on a Thursday. Now, st
ory. Cup -- I believe we went -- left on a 
Thursday , but I have since met a -- a -- so
me body who was on it, who was not only 14 
years old to my  10, but Orthodox, a
nd he knows we left on a Satu rday. 
Q: That™s interesting. Cause in the book 
you -- book, you clearly
 say it™s Thursd ay. 
A: It was thur -- but it was not. According to him -- 

Q: He was -- 
A: -- and we know it was on the same -- 
on the same Kindertransport, the first 
Kindertransport that left. But the interesting 
thing -- and this is something about memory 
-- I believe what my logic tells me. History 
tells me it was on a Saturday, but I still think 
it was on a thur -- 

Q: It™s your experience that it was Thursday . 
A: I left on a Thursday. Which I think tells yo
u a lot about these thi
ngs I™m telling you. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: Right? 
Q: Right. 

A: And that was th-th -- you know, the gr -- 
the great drama of my  leaving and all the 
cousins coming and all the friends coming 
and ev erybody bringing me candy to take 
along with me. And my  mo ther, who wanted to
 do something sp ecial for me, said, I have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
88 
 
 
to pack you food 
for three days, what shall I pack 
for you? And I couldn™t -- I wasn™t 
hungry. I couldn™t think of anything. So 
I said, a wurst. Which is a sausage. 
Q: Right. 
A: And my mo ther said, I am going to  get 
you a wurst. And my father, who was very 
passive I think, or thought until I remember
ed  that it was he who got me on to the 
children -- by th e way, in her 101
st
 year, when I visited my mo
ther in the nursing home, 
she and I did a revisionist history of my  father
. If he got me on to th e Kindertransport, he 
was not the passive -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- and th-th-th-there™s someth
ing we had -- we had left out of th e story, th -- she and I 
together, over the years. 

Q: But even so, in -- in
 the novel, that is th
e one act he performs. 
A: Yes, but -- 
Q: It™s very clear your mo
ther would rather you -- 
A: My mother didn™t wa
nt to hear about it -- 
Q: She didn™t want to
 hear about it, right. 
A: -- she didn™t want it -- it to happen. Sh e -- 
she didn™t argue because the situation -- I 
mean, it was clear by this time, my father ha
d tried every -- see, it wasn™t the only thing 
he did. He was the one who went from consul
ate to consulate. It was he who got our 
name onto -- on to th e American quota, which is
 why I™m sitting here t
oday. So it wasn™t 
-- it wasn™t all that clear -- 
Q: It wasn™t just the one -- uh-huh -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
89 
 
 
A: -- it wasn™t just that one thing. In my he
ad it was the one thing, but my  -- he quarreled 
with my mother, they 
-- he was afraid of her going down
. What if in the last minute 
something happens and prev ents us from -- I me
an, I was supposed to
 -- I was due to go 
to meet up with the -- w
ith the children to go on 
the train that night. 
Q: Right. 
A: Bu t my  mo th er wen t  do wn
 anyhow. I wanted a wurst. I wanted a sausage and I was 
going to  get that sausage and she was going to
 go and get it for me
. And she went down 
and she got it and she came back and m-my -- th
e other thing I reme mb er is the anger of 
one of the aunts, who had twins and how co me
 I got onto the -- my father had got me on 
the Kindertransport, how co me he hadn™t 
taken the trouble to get her twins on the 
transport? And my father -- this I do remember
 very clearly, my father sort of standing 

me between his knees and saying, when  you ge
t to England, you have to talk to the 
English people and you have to tell them to
 get out -- Mom-Mommy  and me out, and th e 
grandparents, and Tante Milla a
nd the twins. And I said, oh yes, yes, that™s what I will 
do, I will get everybody out. And it does seem
 to me an interes
ting -- a -- a horrendous 
burden to  put on a 10 year old -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to save some -- some six or seven 
or eight family members from Hitler, out of 
Hitler™s Germany -- Austria. But I -- I took it 
absolutely seriously, 
that™s what I wou -- 
and I did -- I -- I-I -- I worked at 
it. At least worked at being 
guilty if I wasn™t working at 
it. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
90 
 
 
A: For -- for ye -- for a year or two. 
Q: Mm. 
A: Then everybody went to -- they -- they -- 
the aunts -- the aunts left, the cousins left, 
and my parents a -- a -- I think that th -- we --
 as I remember it, we were allowed to take a 
rucksack, a backpack 
and one suitcase, and no mo re. An
d we had -- we were -- I don™t 
know at what point we were
 given the number 152, but it was certainly -- I-I think it 
might have been when we got -- we -- here
, we walked across th
e bridge and what I 
remember about that is seeing 
my father and mother talking 
over my  head . They held my  
hand and over my  head  they were talking 
about how -- again, the la -- the conversation 

about getting out of -- of -- out of Vienna. A
nd my  mo th er said something like why don™t 
you try the Dutch consulate, and my father saying here, yo
u can go to Chin a and go to 
Beijing. And my  mo ther said, why don™t you try the Dutch -- the Dutch. And I thought 
they are talking -- they are already talking 
about tomorrow and I™m 
not going to  be here 
tomorrow. 

Q: And so it was upsetting you. 

A: Y-Y-Yeah, and I got angry -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- I got really angry and I -- 
I withdrew my hands from them. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And I said to my mother, ﬁL
ook, the moon is reflected in
 the Danube.ﬂ Bu t they kept 
on talking. 
Q: They weren™t paying atten -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
91 
 
 
A: And it was -- it was -- it was one of the hard, 
hard things, that here at this moment I 
am about to leave and they™re talking and th
ey™re not listening to my  -- you know, I -- 
there was a little boy, when  I was living in  Ells
worthy Terrace in England, there was a lit 
-- I watched -- looked out th
e window and there was a little boy walk ing with tw o 
women, one of them was his mo ther, clearly.
 And the -- the -- the tr
ees in the -- in the 
street were in bloom and th e little boy said, 
ﬁMom, look at the -- look at the trees,ﬂ and 
the mother kept talking to her friend. The 
little boy said, ﬁMommy, the trees, the trees, 
look at the trees.ﬂ And I thought, oh, there 
-- there I go. It™s happened again, and they™re 
not listening. An yhow, we got onto the tram -- 
Q: Wait, let me ask you something.  
A: Yeah? 

Q: Who packed your ba -- 
your lugga -- your luggage? 
A: Oh, my moth
er, my mother. 
Q: Your mo ther did. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: And your rucksack? Did you take -- 
A: My mother. 
Q: Your mo ther. So  she packed  ev erything? 

A: Yes, yes. Who else would do it? I -- 
Q: I don™t know, no, was there anything you wa
nted to  take, that you -- that you made a 
decision about? 

A: No, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
92 
 
 
Q: No. But the wurst go
es into the piece of 
-- into the luggage? 
A: The wurst -- 
Q: Wurst. 
A: In germ -- Viennese, it™s a wurst. 

Q: Wurst. 

A: Goes into the backpack. 
Q: Into the b
ackpack, okay. 
A: And I™m not carrying the backp
ack or the -- or the sum --  
Q: They are. 

A: -- they are carrying it. And 
we get into the tram on the other side of the Danube, and 
right across the aisle th ere is a child who is cryi
ng. And I said to my mo
ther, look that girl 
is cr -- little girl is crying.
 And my mother said, yes, and 
I -- you™re not crying, you are -- 
you are s -- being so  brave. And I had a seri
ous doubt on the subject. 
It seemed to me, in 
my  childish wisdom, reasonable to cry, and 
I was not doing it. Cause what I was thinking 
is, wow I™m going to England. Cause I had coun
ted. I had been to Au
stria and I had been  
to Hu ngary and I had been to Czechoslova
kia. Now I was going to  be -- go to -- to 
England, that™s going to be four co untries. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I can™t count E
ngland until I™m there. 
Q: But you have a double thing that goes on in
 you all the time , don™t you? Why aren™t I 
crying, but I™m going to England. 

A: That™s right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
93 
 
 
Q: So it™s -- there™s the -- th
ere™s this -- some kind -- 
A: They -- there™s -- th ere™s the 
-- the -- the -- the feeling is, th
is is a -- this is ex citing, 
this is an adventure. 
Q: Right. 

A: Ought it to be an adventure? Oughtn™t it 
to be a grief and a horro r? I have a friend, 
who -- an old ﬁNew Yorkerﬂ writer, Bernard 
Taper, who was a child of -- a-an English 
Jewish child, with h
ung -- with -- with -- with Amer
ican grandparents -- grand -- an 
American father. The father died , the mother sent him to Amer
ica to be out of the war, to 
be with th -- he had th e same -- he did the same
 thing. He said this 
is -- w-we have talked 
about this. So it™s not -- it™s one way, apparently -- 

Q: Right, sure. 

A: -- to handle this -- this situation. The one -- one o -- it™s not -- 
it™s -- it™s -- 
seemed to 
me unnatural, but it™s one natural way -- thing to do. 
Q: I think so . Wh at™s interesting about you is
 that you have an internal conversation -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- of wondering why ar
e you not crying like that little gi
rl. And at the same -- as if 
there™s some -- 

A: You know, I will ask him. He is still barely alive, but I will ask him if he was doing 

the same -- 
Q: Same thing. 
A: -- if he wa -- he was -- also tu
rned into a write
r, so I mean -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
94 
 
 
A: -- whether he was both playing that -- that
 game with himself and also being aware 
and wondering whether that was kosher.  
Q: Cause you di -- you do this a great deal. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And clearly did it at a very young age. 

A: Yeah, yeah. It was not -- I was not very ol
d wh en I had the distinct -- not so -- it™s not 
an image, the distinct experi
ence of an entity, an -- a watchf
ul -- an eye, a -- a knowledge, 
an awareness sitting -- and it™s over here, and 
taking note of wh at 
was going on. I wonder 
if that™s rare or whether that™s
 -- and I always choose to assu
me first that this is a human 
thing you™re doing, not -- not a special -- th
en you can check it out afterwards, but -- 
Q: I suspect the part that™s ra
r e is t h e double consciousne
ss. I think that what you™re 
doing, it may not be as rare, that a lot of pe
ople do it. I™m not so sure that the double 
consciousness is -- i s - - 
A: You do -- you don™t have a -- a -- a -- an 
observer who is fantastically interested? 
Q: In what™s going on. 
A: Yeah, whatever it is. Whether -- whether 
it™s grief or -- or -- or -- or the thrill  
Q: I™m not -- I™m not sure. I don™t k
now, I have to think about this.  
A: I™m going to do a poll. 

Q: You do a poll, okay. 
A: Oh it™s mostly in polls. Bu
t we get to an open field, 
an open -- a large open space 
behind th e [indecipherable
], the west st ation. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
95 
 
 
A: And there are innumerable bodies, people, 
it™s dark, and there are people with poles on 
which there are placards that say something like 
-- mine particular said 100 to -- o-o-of -- 
one fi -- 150 to 200 -- to 190 -- 199, assuming, right? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And I mu st have had my  number before, 
because we™re -- we™re -- we™re -- my parents 
take me to this one thing. Now, at some 
point I have the famous
 little cla -- little -- little 
wooden -- little -- little pla -- 
cardboard  thing with a number 152, and -- and they -- on -- 
on a -- on a shoe -- shoestring, with a nu -- 
with the same number wh
ich was attached to 
the two pieces of luggage. And I looked -- a
nd my mother was stan ding -- my mother had 
a black pony fur. I™ve always tried -- I -- when 
going in to stores and said if they have a 
pony fur, and they say, a what
? Apparently there is no such thing as a pony fur, but that™s 
what I thought my  mo th er had. And it had a 
biz foc -- big fox co llar, and inside that fox 
collar was her face, and it was perfectly red a
nd hot. And -- but except for its color, she 
made a hi -- a -- a -- a monumental effort to
 neither cry nor look upset. In fact, she was 
talking to  me in what sounded like a normal voice. 
Q: Mm. 
A: And we were just talking and I -- and my fa
ther mu st have been th ere but he was very 
tall and besides he was, as usual, a backgr
ound figure. And then 
at somebody -- point, 
somebody to ld us to line 
up. I think -- I seem to remember th
at we were supposed to be in 
-- in -- in -- in a group -- in four or so. An
d my mother put the ru
cksack on me, and she 
carried the --  
Q: The luggage? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
96 
 
 
A: -- the lu -- th-the -- the little suitcase. Bu
t she kept talking to me, she kept walking 
beside me and talking until 
somebody from the organization [indecipherable] took th e 
suitcase and gave it to me, and the next thi
ng I knew I was through th e portal inside the 
station, and my mother was no longer there.
 Now, I had a friend 
who believed that he 
could elicit forgo
tten information. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And it interested him because I said I reme
mb er my  mo ther holding the suitcase, and I 
remember being inside the train. I seem not
 to have crossed the station, got onto the 
platform, got onto the train, wa
lked into the carriage. And he
 tried very hard, it was very 
interesting. He tried to make -- he tried to 
retrieve the lost memo
ry. I -- I mean, I tried 
very hard.  
Q: You didn™t succeed? 

A: I didn™t succeed, no, I can™t do that, I can™t do it, it™s gone. 
Q: Do you reme mb er saying goodbye? 
A: No, because as a matter of 
fact, I was surprised 
when my mother was not -- oh yes, we 
said goodbye, we -- I kissed my
 mo ther, I must have kissed my
 father, and then -- but the 
-- but she continued to walk
 beside me after that -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- after t h at goodbye. 
Q: Right. And then all of a sudden -- 
A: And then I™m inside the carriage and outside is my cousin Otto™s girlfriend, with red 

hair and who knocked  on th e window. And I c
ould, in those days, and for many, many a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
97 
 
 
decade later, stand on my head. 
So I got down on 
-- on my head and stood and wiggled 
my toes. I was a great showoff. You see, my
 fa -- I had been -- my -- my family had 
brought me up to be a showoff -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- they were always saying, oh she™s so 
-- she can -- she can sta
nd on her toes, she can 
-- 
Q: Right. You™re very -- you were ve
ry proud of being 
able to do that. 
A: I had got all this -- this
 -- all this reinforcement -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- yes. So I stood on my head for her. 
I think there were four children and four 
children. And I remember that it 
took an heck  of a long time, 
too, for the train to go. It 
seemed to take forever. It didn™t go and it di
dn™t go and it didn™t go.
 And we were being -
- there was -- here™s an interesting thing. Th
e Kultusg emeinde is sent with us, of grown -- 
grown people to help us, to be with us. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Who I think tha -- wi -- ﬁInto the Arms of
 Strangersﬂ backs up this memory of mine, 
that they had agreed to go back
. That if they were
 found to have bolted, there were going 
to be no more child
ren™s transports.  
Q: Mm. 
A: And it seems to me so pe
culiar, that the Nazis who want
ed us gone from the world, 
insisted on these people coming back
. There™s so many inexplicable -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
98 
 
 
A: -- and contradictory things in this -- in 
that -- this [indecipherable]. Why not make our 
exit easy? They  made it difficult as possible. 
What was that about? You know, I always 
reme mb er the story of the pharaoh and the -- 
and the gi -- a-and the -- and the Hebrews. 
He wanted  them gone, but wouldn™t let them 
go. What gives? That
™s such a -- such a 
peculiar --  

Q: There™s some tension between both -- 
A: Isn™t there? 
Q: Yes. 

A: And there™s something psyc
hologically peculiar there. Go
, but don™t go. Get out of 
here, but -- 

Q: But we™ll make it hard. 

A: -- we™re gonna close -- or -- close the door
s. Very strange. So  these people came with 
us and as far as I know, stayed a couple of da
ys in the camp s to settle us, and then went 
back. 

Q: And then  went back . 

A: Went back into th
e -- into -- into hell -- into the he
llhole. Meanwhile, it was -- that -- 
that was an exciting -- exciting train ride. Fi
rst of all, the tension and the -- the usual 
nastiness between children, who was going to  
sit by the window. If you were going to lie 

down , somebody else had to stan
d up for awhile. And then it got 
to be your turn to  sit and 
the other person to lie down . And there were 
th -- always the girl who would not get up, 

who wa -- 

Q: Who wouldn™t -- right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
99 
 
 
A: All the way to heaven or hell,
 that™s got to be the person -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- who will not relinquish her seat. 
Q: And with -- were the -- i-in your little cab
in were there mostly
 [indecipherable] -- 
A: All girls. 

Q: All girls -- 
A: All girls -- all girls. 
Q: -- and mostly the same age? 

A: No, no, there were some older wome -- older girls. 
Q: So, older ones, but not -- 
A: So, I mean, the older would be 14 or 15. 

Q: Right. 

A: I was 10. There was a smaller child whom 
I wanted to make friends with, but she was 
-- she was -- I th -- alw ays connected her with
 the child crying on the -- on the tram, but 
there™s no reason to think th at she was. I alwa
ys -- I think I always thought she -- it was -- 
Q: The same one. 
A: And she -- she wouldn™t give up her suitcas
e, she held it on her lap and wouldn™t let it 
go. Then  came o -- and the -- and the -- the he
lper, the wo man would come in and -- and 
say everything™s okay, settle down, we™ll go in
 a little bit. When I got -- was supposed  to 
get up to give my place to somebody, I ha -- 
either remember or have created the good 
girl, the -- the -- the saintly girl who had neve
r slept. I -- I don™t know whether that™s true, 
but she certainly was very sweet,
 very kind to me. She sent me to go wash my face in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
100 
 
 
bathroom, where I discovered the pleasures 
of green soap. Because you could turn it 
upsid e-down  and green soap would come out. 
Q: Really? Oh, right, right. 
A: And the other thing that 
I discovered is that if you go 
to  the toilet and you pee and 
then you put your foot down, th
e thing opens up so  that the -- 
Q: The thing goes -- 
A: -- pee can go through. 
Bu t you could also see 
the rails go underneath. 
Q: Right. 
A: Oh, there™s a lot of fun 
going on in the bathroom. 
Q: Is that the first time you were on a train? 

A: I was on a train all the time fro m -- 
from Vienna to -- to
 my grandparents. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I don™t know that th
at was a proper train, that -- that didn™t count. I don™t 
remember any of these charms -- 

Q: Only these charms that -- right -- 

A: -- of the bathroom. 
Q: -- right.  
A: So finally I had to  get out because peop
le wanted to get in. 
I also remember the 
experience of -- th-there™s always somethi
ng in teresting for children to watch other 
people sleeping. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
101 
 
 
A: I remember being rather terrified at seeing 
my father sleep at some point. That seemed 
very unnatu ral. He was supposed  to be up, I was suppo -- but 
to go along this -- that train 
and look in and see children sleeping was very
 interesting. I remember it. I remember 
people in the act of waking up and sitting 
up and lo oking sort of as if -- you know how 
people sit up, but th ey™re still asleep? 
Q: Asleep, yes. 
A: I remember seeing that. I -- I enjoyed that. 
Q: Did -- did a numb er of kids cry, do you 
remember, w h en you we
re walking through, 
or were people pretty quiet? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er that. 
Q: You don™t remember. 

A: I reme -- then I remember when we got 
to the border and the Na
zis came in, the border 
contrale. And that was really terrifying. That
 I remember being terrifying, because they 
went from -- not carriage, what is it? Ca -- 
what do you call the -- the -- the subdivision, 
the -- the -- the cabin. 

Q: Cabin, a little cabin, yeah. 
A: And they  t -- from our one th ey took one 
child out, and don™t know what happened, 
but she came back and she looked -- she look
ed frightened. And I remember we didn™t 
ask her what had happened. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: She must have been searched. I 
don™t think anything mo re than -- 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
102 
 
 
A: -- happened than that. But th
e -- the girls, the older girls said to us, you mu stn™t move. 
And so we all sat down like that
. You know, when  you sit there like that you begin to -- 
Q: Shak e. 
A: -- vibrate, yes. 

Q: Right. 

A: Was no reason for us to sit like that, but it 
was something to do, I 
think, to be scared. 
It -- it -- it™s almo -- it™s almo
st like an occupation. To sit lik
e that is better than -- cause 
you can™t do noth
ing when you -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And then the Nazi, they got of
f again and the train went on -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- into the -- into the charms of -- of
 being welcomed in 
Ho lland. And be given 
chocolate and apples and it was very sweet, that. 
Q: And that was nice. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: We have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
103 
 
 
Beginning Tape Six 
Q: Just one small detail. When did the kids
 started singing Zionist songs on th e train? 
When  you got into  Holland? 
A: There is a mo ment -- y-you™re on a pl
atform and people, women are coming and 
handing you -- I mean, you are 
-- you™re in the train.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: On the platform are these 
women and they™re handing you 
food, apples, chocolate, hot 
chocolate to drink, chocolate. We -- the trai
n starts up again. The children -- we™re all at 
the windows looking out and th is way and we™re singing g -- wh a -- I wa -- I forget how 

you say that in -- in German, somethin
g Princess Juliana -- Ju-Juliana, yes?  
Q: Yes, sh -- 
A: Does that sound politically incorrect? 

Q: That™s -- sounds right. 
A: I mean, go -- I would not say -- 
Q: Is it [indecipherable]? 

A: -- God bless, but I can™t remember. 
Q: Right. 
A: And the train gathers full 
speed, somebody cries, we™re out. No w, this doesn™t make 
sense, because it should be
 the other way around. 
Q: Other way around. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
104 
 
 
A: Has to be the other way around. But it cert
ainly, at some point somebody says, we are 
out. It -- it has to be. The scene of the -- of 
the platf -- people being on th is platform has 
to be afterwards -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- except it -- I can™t make it do that. I™ll 
tell you why I can™t do -- make it do that in 
my memory. Because somebody says we™re out
 and immediately the -- the train doors 
open up and the boys come in. We were -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- a -- a -- a -- a --  
Q: Segregated. 
A: -- of the girls, and now the boys come in. 
And there is this big -- and they ™re some of 
the bigger boys, and they turn
 back their lapels and they
 have -- I mean, how anybody 
would do that -- they have th
e Kruckenkreu z of Austria, they
 -- they -- it™s -- it™s a cross 
like that and it has -- it has a -- it™s like an ey
e. They  have the Pfad
finder, the -- the -- the 
-- the g-guides -- no, what are Pfadfinder? 

Q: Boy scouts? 
A: Boy scouts, the boy scout. 
I mean, they have all these 
forbidden insignia on th eir 
lapels. And there™s -- they were singing, a
nd I think th ey were singing those Au strian 
songs, pre-Hitler Austrian song
s, and they were singing Zion
ist songs, none of which I 
knew. And I was hugging so mebody, somebo
dy was hugging me. Now, the reason I 
can no t mak e  my  me mo ry  p ro du c
e the scene at the -- when we
 were given the food after 
that -- because I remember goi
ng to sleep in the middle of 
this. That™s what memory 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
105 
 
 
does. And I reme mb er that the very next 
thing that ha -- that happened was that 
somebody was putting my  rucksack 
onto me -- I di -- one of the older girls, or one of the 
helpers, putting my  ruck sack on a-and iden tif
ying my  suitcase and standing me down  in 
the very co ld air on the plat
form. So th -- I mean, you kn
ow, I -- obviously, this is 
logically not possible, but that™s -- that™s how -- 
Q: That™s what your memory -- 
A: -- that™s what memory
, or memory does to me. 
Q: Right. 
A: Clearly. And then we were -- the next thi
ng I reme mb er is being on the boat and being 
led into a cabin, which was incr
edibly comfortable. Imag ine 
after -- this was a day and a 
day, a night -- a day -- a night, a day, a night.
 And now you™re in a little room that has a 
white bed with white sheets. And I had a wo
rry, I had a problem. I couldn™t brush my  
teeth and wh at would my  mo mm y think if I di
dn't  brush my teeth, so that worried me. 
And I had another wo rry. I had been to -- I had 
been told that when 
you go on the water 
you throw up. So I went, got 
into bed, and I prayed. I-I 
was sorry I hadn™t -- I hadn™t 
brushed my teeth. I hoped God would not met 
-- let me  throw up and please don™t get -- 
take my parents to the -- away [indeciphe
rable]. Which incidentally, having your pa-

parents taken [indecipherable] was daily. I 
mean, you could -- we™d
 always hear of 
somebody -- so and so having be
en  taken away, mo stly men. Almo st always men, but not 
entirely. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
106 
 
 
A: So your parents being taken aw ay, your fa
ther being taken away, it was just -- it wa -- 
it was what happened instea
d of going to the office. 
Q: Right. 
A: So -- and then I remember this black stewar
d coming in and I™m s -- I said to him, am 
I going to th row up? And he said no, what you 
do is you put your head down  and you go 
right to sleep and then  you won™t throw up. 
Oh , and I also asked him -- he had brought 
me something th at looked like coffee and he 
said, no tea. And I said white tea? And he 
said, tea with milk. Which was my 
first experience of English tea. 
Q: Did you have tea wh en you were in Vienna? No. 

A: Not that I know of. 
Yes, tea with lemon. 
Q: With lemon, but not with milk. 
A: Lemon and sugar. 

Q: Right. 
A: That was a great experience, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: But not tea with milk, 
that looked 
like coffee. 
Q: Right.  

A: But he was ex -- he was very sympat
hetic. He was very tall and sympathetic. 
Q: Were you alone in  this cabin? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
107 
 
 
A: Yes. And I was also trying out my Englis
h on him and it wo rked  fairly well. The next 
day we arrived and th e boat was on -- standi
ng there. The next thing as I remember, 
between then and getting to the ca
mp , was the world of waiting.  
Q: Mm. 
A: You waited in the boat to be processed 
by these ladies sitting ar
ound the table. I was 
wanting for one of the many photographers to co
me and take my  picture. And they didn™t 
-- and they  didn™t take my  picture. And I 
tried many things. I tried sleeping, I tried 

hopping, I tried eating. Oh, I forgot about th e sausage. I have to tell you ab out the 

sausage. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Because on the f -- when -- on the -- on the 
-- on the train, we were supposed to eat 

something and I took the sausage and I hated it.  

Q: You hated it? 
A: I couldn™t bear it, so I at
e some chocolate instead. And th e next day there was still this 
sausage and I tried it again. And by that 
time it was kind of yucky looking and I tried it 
again, I really didn't like it. It was not th
e sausage I -- I wanted an
d liked. So that™s -- 
Q: You wanted another kind of sausage? 
A: So I™m -- I guess. 

Q: Uh-huh, I guess. 
A: I mean, when I said to my
 mother I want sausage, I wa
s just saying so mething because 
she needed me to say someth
ing, not because I had a tast
e in my mouth that needed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
108 
 
 
satisfaction. So I ate more chocolate, and I had boiled sweets and I had mo re chocolate. 
And I was eventually processed a
nd given that visa, that -- I -- 
I t -- that I showed you -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- th-that c-card -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that special -- I mean, it was instead of 
a visa. It -- to get a visa from the Austrians 
was a nightmare. It™s like goin g to the Social Se-Security. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right? 
Q: Right.  
A: That™s what it -- and they -- a-a
nd they meant it to be difficult.  
Q: Right.  

A: So we had these alternative things. And th
ey either -- the -- eith
er the lady gave it to 
me -- I don™t know, but it had something to  do
, I saw that for the first time. And here 
comes another wrong memo ry. I was processed,
 and now I c-could -- 
could go with my  
coat, no suitcase, down the gangplank. Wh at I reme mb er is going down th e gangplank 
entirely by my self, seeing an empty dock with 
work ers standing, watching, and that there 
was a mist, a -- a s -- a -- a -- one of those Englis
h -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s like -- it™s like as if 
mist had been decimated and was hanging in 
the air, going down  to a huge glass and iron 
hangar where were rows and rows of suitcases
 and I was told to get mine. And the notion 
of finding mine in all this 
seemed to me a nightmare. So I sat down and cried so me mo re. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
109 
 
 
And somebody came and of course all they di
d was look at the number and then  go to  the 
number. 
Q: Right. 
A: But here is the puzzle. There exists, and 
it was given me by the wa -- la -- the producer 
of the movie, ﬁInto the Arms of Strangersﬂ, wh ich deals with the -- with the 

Kindertransport, they  actually found a pict
ure of me coming off the gangplank. You can 
see the -- I have it, I own it, I own this little 
picture. It says 152. I have my little cap on 
and I™m not alone by any means, I™m one of 
an-any numb er of children coming down th e 
gangplank. I™ve given up trying to dis-disent
angle memory from the 
evid -- from contrary 
evidence. 

Q: But if your experien ce of that was of isolation -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, it is not -- it -- it -- 

Q: -- then you would just -- yo
u™d knock ev erybody else out. 
A: -- it isn™t -- it isn™t that puzzling, yes -- 

Q: Right, that one -- 

A: -- perhaps it™s not, you™re quite right -- 
Q: -- that one isn™t. 
A: -- that™s very true, that™s not that puzzling.
 I had a sense that I was alone in the wo rld -
- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- going into a world I didn't u nderstand -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
110 
 
 
A: -- going to do a task which 
was demonstrably impossible. 
Q: Right. 
A: So then we sat in -- on th
e -- on -- then we sat in a way -- in a place where we waited 
for a train. And then  we got in a train and 
then we sat in a place where we waited for a 
bus. And then we sat in a bus. And then a bu
s -- I wa -- of -- there™s a double-decker bus 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Did you go to th e bathroom in any of this
 here? Did you -- is there any bath rooms in 
this waiting period? 
A: Don™t rememb er going. 
Q: Okay . 
A: [indecipherable] rememb
er going to th e bathroom. 
Q: I don™t know, I just -- 

A: Okay, I remember the 
bathroom on the train -- 
Q: -- given our co nversation about
 what we don™t talk about -- 
A: Yes, I don™t remember -- 

Q: In the train 
you do, you know? 
A: -- there must have been. 
Q: Cause it sounds like there are long pe
riods of time after you get off the boat. 
A: Oh, like a day, yes. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: Yeah, it must have been. 

Q: So it must have been . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
111 
 
 
A: But I™m still eating my chocolate -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and -- 
Q: And then na -- 

A: -- and it does occu r to me that I™m not going to eat the sausage -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- but there™s nothing I can do ab
out that, so I pack it back -- 
Q: And you keep it. 
A: -- pack it back up and -- I 
do remember approach
ing this little -- little
 city of tiny little 
huts on the seashore. It was adorable, these 
little -- they look lik
e little dollhouses. When 
I -- later on, when I was with 
my first foster family in Li
verpool, the Cohens, I wrote up 
this experience that you and I are talki
ng ab out now. And I rememb er thinking how 
disappointing it was to just a
rrive there, no sunset, no sunris
e, so I stuck one in. Exactly 
the kind of thing as a grown-up writer that
 I would never do, I would never you know, 

tweak it, never. 

Q: Like that, never. 
A: I mean, it™s absolutely ag
ainst my -- I very -- my -- my
 -- my deepest morality says 
you don™t tweak a memo ry. 
Q: No? 
A: I mean, it may be
 a wrong memory -- 
Q: Right, but you don™t tweak it. 
A: -- but you don™t mess wi -- you don™t tweak it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
112 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You don™t enhance it. 
Q: Whatever is there, is there. 
A: Yes, and you keep -- in fact
, you keep it at its lowest and 
let it work. That™s -- that™s a 
-- that™s a -- that™s a holy -- 

Q: It™s a holy writ. 
A: Abso lutely.  
Q: Yes. 

A: Very few th -- very few holy [indecipher
able]. You don™t -- you don™t distort f-for 
purposes of drama, is -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So we -- 

Q: So are you getting an tsy in all of 
this waiting and tr -- or -- or not -- 
A: Exhausted, tired, sleepy. 

Q: You™re -- so you™re tired, sleep y? 

A: Sleepy. There are no strong emotions, no 
dram -- no s -- no drama. None of the things 
that would make a good movie. 

Q: And the other kids? Everybody™s the sa -- 

A: Everybody -- 
Q: -- is the same. 
A: Well, if you see -- if 
you look at the children in 
the -- in -- in the movie -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
113 
 
 
A: -- nobody is -- nobody is acting up -- 
Q: No. 
A: -- nobody is screa m ing, nobody is howling.  
Q: No. Right. It™s very quiet. 

A: They™re howling -- they may be 
howling interially, but they™re -- 
Q: Right. 
A: We were then taken to this huge hall. Th
e -- I -- I -- I understand that these -- these 
camps were w-workers holiday camp, closed fo
r the winter and they  had opened them up 
for us. They were su-summer ca
mps, they were not for the winter, so while we were there 
they were installing -- this turn
ed out to be one of the ha -- 
coldest winters in memory and 
they installed ovens, stoves, w
ith -- with those l -- with t
hose long -- with those -- what 
do you call it?  
Q: Pipes [indecipherable] 
A: Pipes that were led up out t -- of the ceiling -- 
Q: [coughing] Excuse me. 

A: -- the glass ceilings. 
Q: Right. 
A: After we were addressed by the camp 
leader -- I-I don™t rememb er anything about 
that, we were sitting there wi -- we were a
ssigned five little girls with one older one, or 
four little girls with one older one, and assi
gned to a particular -- one of these little 
houses. And a-after we had put down  our -- our
 -- our suitcases and chosen our beds, we 
were supposed to go back fo r a meal. And I said I didn™t
 want to go, because it had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
114 
 
 
occurred to me I had to do something with
 this scosset -- this
 sausage, which was 
beginning to smell noticeably an
d had been commented upon by
 the little girls in the -- in 
-- the little girls in [indecipherable] what -- w h
at™s [sniffs]. So I said I wa -- I w asn™t 
hungry, I was sleepy, I was going 
to  stay there. And I was going to  figure out wh at to do 
with this thing. And here comes one of the 
great puzzles in life. How do you -- how do 
you get rid of something th at smells bad, 
which your mother has 
given you before you 
left Vienna. There is no way that you can th
row it out, but there is no way you can keep 
it. 

Q: Keep it. 
A: And this is a problem. 
Q: Right. You got a big problem here. 

A: You got a big problem and you keep thinki
ng th at any mo ment now, you™re going to 
figure it out. But you™re also sleep y , so you 
lie down in  the bed, and you™re going to  
figure this out. By  this time you hear --  

Q: The kids coming back. 

A: -- the kids coming back, so 
you scoot it under the bed. I mean, y-you take that -- it™s in 
-- it™s in a paper bag -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and scoot it under the bed. 
Q: Right. 
A: Well, who is the horrible person w
ho has made in her bed? Yes, who -- 

Q: Who did it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
115 
 
 
A: Y-You jo  -- you join , you know, where™s 
the thief? You join 
the -- it™s -- it was a 
problem for -- for man y  a day. 
Q: So what did you end up doing? 
A: Noth ing. 

Q: Nothing? Did it just shrivel up, what? 

A: It shriveled up and stank. 
Q: And just stayed there. 
A: It stayed there. It stayed there. I trie
d several things. I tried to bury -- now -- by now 
the f -- the ground is frozen stiff. I took it outsi
de and tried to make a hole for it with the 
heel of my -- of my shoe, it wo -- it wouldn™
t -- it wouldn™t. It did occur to me I could 
throw it in the garbage, but I -- you couldn
™t. How -- you can™t throw that away. Your 
mommy we -- went all the way down, she had 
a fight with your fath
er about going down  
to get it, I mean. Anyhow, he
 -- in -- in the -- in the -- 
they were -- th
ey -- they -- 
meanwhile we spend mo st of our
 time in this big hall. We st
and around the -- the stoves. 
They  -- we have -- there™s a -- there™s a --
 a drawing competition. There™s the bodybuilder 
who came and did a performance for us. 
Q: There™s film of 
that, I think. Yes. 
A: There™s -- no -- 
Q: Oh, was that -- is -- 
A: -- there™s a film of -- of a guy pl
ay -- wh-who -- a tennis -- a tennis guy -- 
Q: That™s true, you™re right, you™re right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
116 
 
 
A: No, ours was a -- ours -- and I was so impre
ssed with him because he -- all he had on, 
these little purple trunks and it was really cold
, and he could flap 
his stomach muscles. 
That™s what I most -- 
Q: That™s -- 

A: He could flap -- flap this one -- 

Q: And flap that one. 
A: -- he™d flap this one. And I -- I did 
feel that it was very sweet of him. 
Q: To come. 
A: It was sweet of him to be there. The other 
thing that I rememb er is that th e mayor of lo 
-- I think it was in Lowestoft. They were -- 
we were in two camps, but we™ll make it in 
one camp, it™s too long a story. We were move
d out of the first camp because the next set 
of -- of -- 

Q: Kids were coming. 
A: -- kids were coming. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And I think they  divided boys from the girl
s cause they were doing th ings that you™re 
not supposed to. Even 
in -- even in this -- 
Q: Even in this situation. 

A: -- yes. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Where the little kids were -- w ere -- I don™t know, but there -- th ere was a -- there was 

-- we were separated and moved on in a train to another camp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
117 
 
 
Q: So the girls were separated? 
A: I don™t remember. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: I do not remember. I -- I only remember th
at I -- well, the people I was with, I was 
suddenly no longer with, I was 
with other people. Here it becomes -- you know, there™s -- 
it™s interesting, there™s just 
so much memory that you -- 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- or detail that you can put in, then -- th
en i-it™s full and -- and there™s no more room. 
Q: Right. 
A: The things rapidly that I remember. I re
memb er the mayor coming and my thinking I 
was going to  ask the mayor -- my  daddy had sa
id, you must talk to
 the English people 
and get them out of Vienna. My grandp
arents, my parents, my Tante Milla. 
Q: And the two boys, right? 

A: And so I was thinking I™m -- I will go up to 
the mayor and ask him. And I said to the 
girl who -- our -- th-the -- the -- the first big 
girl, I said to her, ho
w do you say to bring 
out of Vienna, or some -- some phrase. 
And she said, I don™t know. Now, I was still 
going to -- I had this -- this idea that once I wa
s face to face with the mayor I would have 
the right words. But of course when it came 
to the point, I wasn™t
 even sure which was 
the mayor and at that mo ment somebody addr
essed us, somebody -- he had a bad cold, I 
reme mb er that. The mo ment never happened
. And now I-I -- you know, I was beginning 
to wo rry that I was not doing th is thing. My pa
rents were going to be taken to ca -- to -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
118 
 
 
wasn™t called concentration camp in the war, I 
don™t know what it was called. But it was -
- 
Q: Whatever. Wasn™t [indecipherable] 
A: -- whatever it was, they we
re going to go because I had 
forgotten to -- I hadn™t got 
around to  talking to  the mayor. The other thi
ng I remember is that there were all of a 
sudden in the camp, these ki
nd of -- these kind of things. 
Q: What, wires? 

A: Wires. They were all written because they were -- they were -- they
 were filming it all, 
or -- or putting it on tape. 
Q: Really?  
A: And I remember all of a sudden th-there
 were these me -- th
ese snakes, these big 
snakes. 

Q: Big -- real snakes? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No, no, the wires. 

A: These snaky looking wires there, yeah. 
Q: Right, right. Did they take your f -- th
ey obviously  took your 
picture somewhere.  
A: Maybe. I don™t -- let me get on with this. 
What -- what I also re
memb er i s t h ey  were 
dancing the horah , the children w
ith their arms around each other and I wanted  to dance, 
but I didn™t know if I was meant to join th em
. And I didn™t know how 
to get my self out of 
my chair, into the situation of
 dancing. And I thought, I wi
sh somebody would come and 
ask me. So one of the ladies -- there were -- ther
e were lots of ladies in -- suddenly, in fur 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
119 
 
 
coats. And -- and one of the la
dies in fur coat said, don™t yo
u want to dance? And I said 
no. And she said, why don™t y
ou come and dance? I said I don™t want to. And th en she 
went away, and I thought, if she comes back a
nd asks me again, then I will come. Course 
she never came back. And I told th is story th
a-th-th-th-th-th-the Austrian filmmaker took 

us around and to ok us to some of these camps
 that now exist, that resemble these camps. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I was telling these tha -- th -there was a -- a-a -- a f-f -- a photo -- 
Q: Camera? [indecipherable] 

A: -- camera, who was about 19 years old a
nd there was the -- th-the -- the -- the person 
with the boom. He™s a young, 
gorgeous young -- young man. And I told him this story, I 
thought it was so peculiar of a -- 
of a -- of a child that wasn™t 
able -- oh, they said, I know 
just how that felt. I know ex ac
tly wanting to dance and not. 
Q: So did you ev er get up? 
A: Th -- I never got up, never got up. 
Q: Never. 

A: Sta -- sat in my little coat. 
And you know, the longer you s
it, the less possible it is to 
get up. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: The -- th-the -- there were ladies walki
ng around with -- with -- 
what -- what -- what 
do you call the thing that you -- clipboards
. And walking around saying -- saying to 
children -- choosing children.
 They were looking for 20 
children to go -- I mean, the 
whole point of our being in  the camp  is -- wa
s ba -- while they were finding us foster 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
120 
 
 
homes, or schools to go to, or making the arra
ngements. By the way, one of the things my 
mother said mo-most recently, she said, it just 
occurs to me that wh
en we sent you away, 
we had no addresses. We didn™t know -- 
Q: Right. 

A: And that seems so amazing. Cause they were still in the 
process of finding places to 
put us. 
Q: Right. And they didn™t know
 wh ere you were going to go. 
A: They didn™t know where we -- 
Q: Right. 
A: Anyhow, they were walking around and th
is lady comes up to me and says -- two of 
them, there were two of them, and one of th
em came up to me and said, wh-w hat is your 
name? I said, Lore Groszmann. How old are yo
u? I am -- I said half past 10. And sh e 
said, would you like -- oh, they  
said to each other, she speaks
 English. And one of them 
said, would you like to go to an
 Orthodox home? I said yes.
 And so they put me down 
and they said tomorrow you™re
 going to Liverpool. And th
en when they™d
 gone, I was 
writing a letter -- I was in process of writing a le
tter, I said, by the wa y, what™s Orthodox? 
Q: You were writing to your parents? 

A: To my parents, what™s -- what does that
 mean, Orthodox? And my  father wrote me 
back and said, do not go to 
an Orthodox home. By that tim
e I was already in being -- 
Q: [indecipherable] over there. 

A: -- having learned -- I was already doin
g a good job not tying my shoelaces on a 
Saturday. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
121 
 
 
Q: And you liked it. You liked it. 
A: I liked it. I liked it. You 
know, there is someth
ing in a confusio n, if there™s certain 
things you know are right and 
wrong. This you™re supposed
 -- I never learned how they  
were -- expected me to  hold my knife and 
fork, cause it was different. That I couldn't 

figure out. But to not tie my  shoes on a 
-- on a -- on a Shabbas, that I could do. 
Q: That you could do. 
A: There were lots of things that were very 
clear, and I thought it was interesting. I thou -
- I-I thought that was good. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I -- I knew to tell them th-that I -- the -- the ca -- the maid not to put the milk 
[indecipherable] and the [indecipherable
] together, I figured that one out.  
Q: It™s interesting. Wh
en did you start writin g le
tters? A fter you got to the 
[indecipherable] 
A: Oh, in the camp I started -- 
Q: In the camp. 

A: -- writing camp -- and I wrote 
letters to my parents and my
 grandparents and I wrote 
letters to the cousins, here come th e cousin s. The cou -- the -- the -- Tante -- Tante Erna, 

who had been called a cow, they  were al
ready in England because of his business 
connections. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And I wrote them inte
rminable letters. Now -- 

Q: The cow was in England. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
122 
 
 
A: The cow was in England, 
the cow and her husband.  
Q: And her hu -- 
A: Tante Erna and Uncle Ernst were already in
 England and they  -- I wrote them letters. 
Now, wh at I think happened  is
 that they sent the letters
 on to  the organization called 
Bloomsbury House, wh ich was -- you 
must have come across that, no? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: They were the o -- they
 were the organizers, together with the Viennese 
Kultusg emeinde for -- for managing these ref
ugee matters. Because my  parents did, as a 
matter of fact, by March have a visa to Engla
nd as a married couple; that is to say as a 
butler and cook. I have always assumed, and 
I don™t know why I know th is, that my  uncle 
e -- Uncle Ernst sent this [indecipherable] or
 in some way organized this, because I don™t 
know who else would have organized it, ther
e was nobody in England except I and th ese 
cousins, who could have -- 
Q: But your -- your letter, the one letter that 
I read is extremely poignant, because while 
you™re talking like a kid about how wo nderful 
things are, things 
-- but in your heart 
there™s this fear about your parents. And 
I can imagine someone receiving th at letter -- 

A: And being moved by it. 
Q: -- and being moved and si -- 

A: I was also operating like a writer. I had 
-- I had images. Out -- outside -- out behind 
the -- behind the cottage was a rose, and th
e ro se had snow on it and I was saying how 
will my parents -- if you don™t get my parents 
out, they  will die like th
e rose in the snow, 
stuff like that.

Q: Like in the [indecipherable], right. It
™s fabulous, and unusual, it seems to me. 
A: And I also thought, 
that™s really good. 
Q: That™s real -- you did. You -- you knew it was good. 
A: Oh, that™s a good one. 

Q: It was, it™s a great -- you™re too mu

Beginning Tape Seven 
A: I want to tell you about the other image 
that -- that I rememb
er from -- from a letter 
which I was proud of, and which I think makes 
a -- m-ma -- it™s really more interesting. 
Wa -- one of the problem
 -- one of the problems of getting out of Austria, out of Hitler-
land was that you needed a number of documents. 
You needed a visa to get into the other 
country. You needed  a -- the peop
le of -- a letter from -- of either a job or people to look 
out fo r you. You need ed an exit visa. And all of
 these things were dated, and all of these 
things had to  be somehow procured and curre
nt at the same time. A nd it simply didn™t 
happen. And my image was to sa
y what I™ve just said to you,
 and say, it™s like winding up 
a ball of wool that keeps falling out of your 
hands and unraveling. And I thought that was 
pretty good.  

Q: That was pretty -- 

A: And I mean, it even refers to
 something real, that was a r
eal, real disastrous problem. 
Q: Yes, because you can™t -- 

A: An-A nd the w -- yes -- 

Q: -- you can™t catch it. 
A: -- and the -- it was also the m -- the ma
lice of all the countries like America, who 
made as ma ny -- who put as many roadblocks 
in the way as possible, unconsciously, I 
believe.  

Q: When you wrote these letters to your relative
s, were you mainly at the Cohens or were 
you -- 

A: No, these were done -- these w ere 
written in -- in the camp, in the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
125 
 
 
Q: But this -- this one, if this is -- 
A: The one that I™m talking abou
t, the one with the rosebud -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- was definitely from the camp b
ecause th e rosebud was outside the -- 
Q: But you mu st have known th
at you were going to the Cohe
ns, because this particular 
letter seems to have care of Lore Shelly at the Cohens. 
A: This somebody else™s writing. Look 
at that. That™s a grown-up writing. 
Q: Oh, you™re right. 
A: Somebody put that on, I -- I 
was surprise d to see that. Some
body mu st have added th at 
to my letter. 

Q: Put it on later. 

A: Did you see that? 

Q: You™re right, it isn™t your hand -- it isn™t the same  -- 
A: No, not at all. 
Q: -- you™re absolutely right. 

A: That™s a grown-up. 
Q: You™re right, cause your handwriting is different, I™m sorry. 
A: I mean, we gave the letter -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- to the camp person -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- who must then have -- that must 
have been in th at
 [indecipherable]. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
126 
 
 
Q: So you™re very self-conscious in 
writing these letters, of tryi -- of -- 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Both  of being the writer and being this 
-- a desperate kid who wants your parents out. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: And you love the fact that you create 
these great images at the same time. 

A: Yes -- 
Q: You™re very -- 
A: -- yeah. It™s not pure. 

Q: It™s -- n o , no, no, I understand it™s not pur
e. Do you have all these letters? Did you 
ever get all of them back? 

A: I think I do. I also have the letters I wr
ote to my  grandparents that are incredibly  
boring. 

Q: Incredibly boring? 
A: And later on -- boring. I mean, what do you
 write to your grandparents year -- week 
after week after week? And wh
at do th ey write to you? I 
mean, at o n e point I started 
learning to play the piano and I would tell th
em what I was learning to play . And since I 
learned to play the same thing th rough many 
a month, that™s what was in those letters. I 
have those letters. 
Q: You have those letters. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: This one I don™t think has the -- see -- s
ee whether you recognize 
this letter. Can you 
see it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
127 
 
 
A: Not without my glasse
s, sorry. Here, hang on
to that for a second. 
Q: Okay . This is where 
you™re writing to ern -- 
A: Is that the letter that was in the -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: In -- 

Q: In the book. 
A: In the book. 
Q: In your own book you don™t -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- you don™t repeat the letters. 
A: Today fourt -- is 14
th
 of December. We live in a holiday camp. That™s -- so that is still 
-- 

Q: The camp, right. 
A: -- that is still in the camp. 
Q: And 14
th
 of December is only a few da
ys after you actually left. 
A: Right. In fact, it must be the firs
t day we were there. We left on the 12
th
, that I™m 
pretty sure about. 
Should I read it? 
Q: So this means -- 

A: Shall I read it? 
Q: Yeah, read it. 
A: Ah, we live in a holiday camp toge 
-- oh, this is a translation, obviously. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, you didn'
t write in English. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
128 
 
 
A: Y-Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. I don™t know if it™s a good translation. 
A: ﬁOur address will be Dovercourt Camp, 
Holiday Camp, Harwich, England.ﬂ That™s 
the second camp, the first was Dovercourt, right. 
Q: Right. 

A: ﬁWhere I am now it is beautiful. We live in
 dark brown huts in wh ich no more than 
four children can sleep. We have two little wi
ndows with red curtai
ns. When we in the 
hut put the light on, it looks from 
outside as if there were a fire
 inside. In front of the hut 
are small green wooden fences. 
In the morning when I sit up 
in bed, I can look through 
the window and see far out across the ocean. 
Sometimes the sun has reddened the sky so 
that it looks as if there were pink silk drawn 
across it. The juicy green grass, tooﬂ -- this is 
-- this is self consciously pu
-purple, all right? ﬁThe juicy green grass too, adds to the 

beauty of the region.ﬂ 
Q: Uh-huh, yes. 
A: Yeah. ﬁJust imagine, it is 
so beautiful here and yet it is
 not beau tiful. I would almo st 
say that it is ugly because whatever I am doi
ng, I must think of my beloved parents. 
Though it is good to think of one™s parent
s, it  is not good when one doesn™t know 
whether they were still able to 
sleep last nightﬂ -- yeah, this is
 purposeful. Yeah, this is -- 
this is meant to be a tear raiser -- tearjerker. 
Q: Yeah, but not every 10 year 
old, for heaven sakes, would -- 
A: No, I was a special 10 year -- 
Q: You were a special 10 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

A: -- who -- who was a good tearjerker. ﬁThou
gh it is good to ﬂ [indecipherable] -- 
ﬁdoesn™t know whether they we
re still able to sleep last ni
ght and when one doesn™t know 
if they will have enough money to pay for the 
emigration ticket. It is going to take a very 
long time. No, then it is trul
y not good to think ab out it. 
Sometimes when I think about it 
I have to keep my self from crying, and 
not out of homesickness,
 but because of the 
above-mentioned reasons.ﬂ 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: ﬁThat is why I beg you a thousand times to give me news 
of my parents. I have written 
to them too late to expect an answer by next
 week and I™m afraid th
at they might not get 
my  letter, and beg you to answer
 me immediately. And one mo re request, and this is the 
biggest one that I have ever had. In  case my
 parents are not able to emigrate, p lease, 
please try and buy th em a visa 
to Paraguay or get my  poor -- my  poorﬂ -- there are many, 
many -- 
Q: Zeroes. 
A: -- zeroes. I don™t know how to re

A: ﬁPlease, please write to me, ev en if 
there™s no good news to be told. Many, many

Q: It™s a fabulous letter. 

A: Yeah, it is a fabulous letter, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
130 
 
 
Q: It™s [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, it™s amazing -- 
Q: It™s very unusual -- 
A: -- yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- to think of a 10 year old writing this. 

A: Yeah [indecipherable] 
Q: And so it™s not difficult to
 think that they would be -- 
A: Be moved, ah, oh surely --  
Q: -- extremely moved -- 
A: -- surely. 
Q: -- and try to do something. 

A: And the anxiety is very genuin e. 

Q: Yes, yeah.  
A: I remember -- I-I remember a d ream of my
 grandmother crucified. Now, where I get 
that shape from, she was a -- 
she was nailed to a wall like this. That was a -- o n e -- one 
dream that -- from which I woke 
with a -- with -- with -- in a 
-- in a sweat. And then, after 
my  -- I™ve learned that my  grand -- my  parents had moved again, to another apartment. 
This is now when I™m living in -- in -- in Li
verpool with th e Cohens
. Let me just finish 
the little story. The next morning, after I had 
said I wanted to go live an Orthodox family 
-- 

Q: Mm. 

A: -- that my father™s warning about not
 going to  Orthodox 
reached me -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
131 
 
 
Q: While you were there, right. 
A: But the next day we went on the train out
 to Liverpool. And it was while I was out in 
the bathroom here, wa -- out 
in the bathroom. I came back
 to the -- to the -- to the 
compartment, that™s what it™s called, and fo
und th at somebody had taken down my  -- my  
rucksack, my backpack
, opened it up, and there was th
e sausage. Which by now had a 
different kind of smell. It™s no longer active 
decay, but that sort of musty smell. And one 
of the -- 

Q: So you put it back in your -- 

A: Oh, I kept putting it back. 
Q: Oy vey. 
A: Cause I couldn™t thro w it away. 

Q: Right. 

A: And one of the children said, it isn™t even kosher. 
Q: [laughs] 
A: And I died. I mean, I remember -- here -- he
re™s a -- here™s an image that I res -- I-I -- 
do you know, you feel as if th
e waters close over you, of 
shame, of embarrassment. Now 
when we got out, I guess it wa
s the s -- in -- in -- in -- in 
Liverpool, that one -- the two 
ladies were -- who were -- picked us up sa
id to me, now you can th row it away. And I 
threw it away and I finally hollered.  
Q: Mm. 
A: And I rememb er -- you know, because you
 -- you keep commen
ting on the double 
consciousness, I reme mb er howling and I reme
mb er looking at the two ladies and seeing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
132 
 
 
they were frightened , because they  didn™t 
know what to do with 
an out of control, 
weeping child. Anyway -- 
Q: Was -- was that your -- your separating? 
A: It was that -- that sausage. 

Q: That -- which was separating from your mother -- 

A: Well, it was -- you know, I me an, we all 
know -- know that something given us by 
somebody has -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- it -- it becomes a -- it b
ecomes a sympathetic magic, I mean, it™s a magical object. 
Q: Right, you™re right, right. 

A: That™s why it -- so many [indecipherable]
 Victorians will have lockets, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Stupid things, but they
 represen t -- they represent the person who gave them. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And I think that sausage -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- had got a -- had got a 
wallop of that kind of -- 
Q: Abso lutely. 
A: -- of meaning.  
Q: So this is --  
A: But I just wanted to bring 
us to it, to get -- get us fi
nally to Liverpool. What wa -- 
what were you asking me about
 the letter? What -- oh, something about the letters. One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
133 
 
 
thing you do wh en you 
really need letters desperately, 
you try and keep disappointment at 
bay. So  I would make long arithmetical arrange
ments with my self. I would say, it takes -- 
it™ll take fiv e days to get to Vienna, it™ll take
 them five days to an
swer. Then they will -- 
it takes five days to get back, let™s say six days
. I™m not going to have a letter for the next 
15 days. Then of course
 on the next day you ge
t a letter. Happiness. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I turned that -- I had a little friend ca
lled Renata and I turned
 that into a game 
with her and she never understood 
what the principle was. So -- 
Q: She always had th e wrong -- 

A: She always -- she always made -- well, sh e ma
de her letters come as fast as possible.  
Q: Possible, right. 
A: I was always winning. 

Q: And you were always winning, right. 
A: Until she -- until she said sh
e wouldn™t play any more. 
Q: So this is a real story 
that you have in th e book. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: This is -- this really  happened. 
A: Yes, oh yeah, abso  --  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: -- oh yeah, yeah. But I wanted to tell -- I 
wanted to  give you some sense of how -- 
how it was, that fear for the parents. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
134 
 
 
A: Once I learned that my  parents had once ag
ain moved, now I™m without a -- a visual -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- place in which to place them. And I ha
d a extraordinarily un
comfortable image of 
my father on a -- I think it™s -- I th ink it™s so
mething I got from Laurel and Hardy. I think 
at one point one of them is up on a big po -- th
-that -- that connection came to me as ki -- 
came to me long afterwards, bu
t the-there™s a pole and one of them is straddling on top, 
you know, with a for -- like -- lik e a -- like a 
-- like a -- like a bug that
™s -- that™s wiggling 
its -- and the problem is, as long as I was -- if 
I tried to think of my  parents, they were up 
on th at extremely uncomfortable pole. So I 
had to si -- try to not th ink about them. 
Q: Right. 
A: Which is like the el
ephant in the room. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And it was excruciating, the -- the compli -- 
the -- th e -- the -- the 
tri -- the attempt to 
not think about your parents because if you th
ought ab out them they would -- they would 
be uncomfortable. It was -- it was a -- for m 
-- for many days in -- my occupation. And I 
think my  -- the foster parents, the Cohens, 
would see me suddenly 
get up and run out of 
the room and come back agai
n in an attempt to get away
 from the image, with a --  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- or to occupy myself in some way 
so I wouldn™t think about them. Very 
[indecipherable] 
Q: And they  -- and th ey woul
dn™t understand, of course. 
A: And of -- they -- I didn™t understand it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
135 
 
 
Q: Right. And yet, you 
couldn™t stop th inking about them in some way. 
A: Well, I couldn't stop thinking about them
 and I had to because it was dangerous for 
them. 
Q: Right. So you were in an impossible situation. 

A: It was i mpossible, yeah. 

Q: It was really impossible. 
A: So the -- the stress was not 
the kind that expresses itself in
 a flow of tears, it™s this 
other stuff.  
Q: Yes. 
A: Now, there was a tear management that I 
learned after awhile. I would sit in front of 
the fire on a low stool and I discovered that
 if you -- if you a -- you -- you can use tears 
like a blanket, but you didn™t want to cry th
em, because then -- the 
blanket then was all 
over. So  I would bring them up to  here, and sit 
looking into the fire and to have tears up 
to here. And that -- I got -- I got an exp -- got to
 be expert at being able to do that. And of 
course these poor people were trying to  cheer me up. 
Q: Right. 
A: They kept telling me I -- why -- why -- don™
t be -- don™t be miserable, and I™m s -- I 
was saying I™m miserable, I™m not misera
ble. I wish I was properly miserable. 
Q: When  you say 
you brought the tears up to here -- 
A: Up to here -- 
Q: -- you mean -- 

A: -- that™s how it felt. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
136 
 
 
Q: -- inside? 
A: That™s how it fel -- up 
to here, yeah, inside. 
Q: Up to here. 

A: Inside. 

Q: Inside the eye. 

A: Before they came out. 
Q: Before they came out. 
A: Yeah, that was it. And you could do that an
d then th ey would st -- then they  would go 

away and you™d have to wo rk at it again to 
-- to get them up there 
and keep  them there. 
Q: Oh my  God. So  they found it extremely di
fficult to be with you, because you were not 
being with them. 

A: I was not being with them and I was unabl
e to call my  foster mother Auntie Lena. 
Q: And she wanted -- 
A: She wanted me to call her Auntie Lena
 and for some -- for reasons that I don™t 
understand, I couldn™t get those wo rds -- 

Q: Out of your -- 
A: -- out of my mouth. So I couldn™t ca
ll her anything. So  another reason I kept 
disappearing from the room, because I coul
dn™t think of a way to address her.  
Q: How did you address the father, Mr. Cohen? 

A: He didn™t demand anything. 
Q: He didn™t de -- oh, so it didn™t matter. 

A: He didn™t ask for anything
, so this wasn™t a problem. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
137 
 
 
Q: I see. O n ly she was the problem. 
A: The girls -- there w ere six girls. 
Q: That™s a lot of people in this house. 
A: Five girls, six girls. I 
have to count them. There were a lot of young wo men, of 
various ages. The youngest was 16, who was 
my friend, who still is, we™re still in -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- w-we write for the Jewish holidays. I go to
 see her when I™m in -- in -- in -- in -- in 
London. She is -- she is a Zionist and a 
poli -- very political, wo
nderful, wonderful 
woman, terrific woman. And she brought me 
books to read wh ich I couldn™t because I -- 
my  English was certainly not up to  that. And 
she brought me paper to write my  story on. 
And that™s when I -- 
Q: Did she -- 

A: -- wrote this story for the first time. 
Q: Really? 
A: 36 pages full of -- full of sunsets and sunrises. 

Q: But that was lovely
 of her to do that. 
A: Very. She was wonderful. 
She was -- she was very sympat
hetic and very, very lovely. 
Q: So sh e was bo -- 

A: The other women -- the other members o f 
that family, except for the father, who 
wanted nothing except to give my sixpences. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
138 
 
 
A: And sit -- let me sit quietly, without 
bothering me, without m -- dem -- without 
making demands on me. It was very sweet to 
sit with my  tears right here and he was 
sitting in his cou -- couch over there, with hi
s big, thick glasses. 
And he would just sit 
and I would sit, and that was very cozy. 
Q: And that was okay. 

A: And as soon as somebody
 else came in, th ere was some
thing I was supposed to do, 
like be cheerful, or cry, or do something -- 

Q: Something. 

A: -- that she could understand. 
Q: So was this daughter with wh om you 
were closer, the youngest of the -- 
A: Ruth, yeah. 
Q: -- oh, ru -- Ruth was her name? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Wis -- she wasn™t like her mother? 
A: No. She was the child in
 the family who was fightin
g her mo ther. Everything her 
mo ther did was stupid.  
Q: Really? 
A: She was the reb-rebellious one. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: She now tells me how mu ch she values 
her parents. Those par -- you see -- you saw 
the parents? 

Q: Yes, I saw the parents [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
139 
 
 
A: And I almost said to her, value what
 -- value what. But I didn™t say that. 
Q: You didn™t say that. 
A: No, I didn't say it. 
Q: You would have a long time ago, I bet. 

A: I hope not. But she is a classy lady. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: To look at, to
 talk to, to -- 
Q: That™s funny. Is it Aunt Lena who tells 
you th at your parents are coming? Who tells 
you? 

A: Aunt Lena -- I am now at a -- at the Jewi
sh school. They put us in a Jewish school. I 
have never -- I -- I look back on
 that, it™s a -- I think it™s a 
-- an Orthodox school, for one 
thing. It™s the world at -- it™s that -- it™s th
e Jewish -- the Jewish world I don™t know. It 
seems s-su -- subclass to me.  

Q: Subclass? 
A: Yes, underclass. I mean, it™s -- it™s -- I don™
t know that world. It™s -- i-it™s sa -- it feels 
to me like as I went into a 
cave, okay? I mean, children we
re still b eing beaten with -- 
with -- with -- with -- 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, ga -- boys. Boys -- 
Q: The boys.  
A: -- boys had their hands beaten with rulers.  

Q: Oh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
140 
 
 
A: I -- it™s really -- it w as really a -- a -- a -- a 
-- a place -- a -- a -- an -- land I don™t know. 
Do you know the kind of thing I 
n -- or don™t -- or don™t you? 
Q: I don™t know. I certainly don
™t know that from experience, 
no. So  they put you in th at 
school and the other girls were -- 
A: All the -- all the children -- 

Q: -- all the children were there. 
A: -- all the 20 -- 20 little girls went into that school. 
Q: 20. 

A: Yes. 
Q: So you get there wh en? Yo
u™re -- you get there Decemb er? 
A: Ah -- I -- this is December -- yes. 
Q: Something December. 

A: I -- I was in two camps for about less than two weeks, I would say. 
Q: Right. 
A: So I -- I we -- I went to -- we came in
 this -- we -- we arrived on December 14
th
 and I 
think before the end of the year, certainly. 
Q: Right. 
A: Bef -- before the end of the year -- 

Q: You were with the Cohens. 
A: -- I was with the Cohens. And I -- I got to be
 11 years old at the Cohens and they were 
going to  give me a party. And 
on the day of -- the day before or the day of my  birthday, 
Mrs. Cohen came -- I-I was called to the head
master™s office, and in the headmaster™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
141 
 
 
office sat Mrs. Cohen and said -- the headma
ster said, you can go home today. And I 
understood -- already understood -- I mean, th
ere mu st have been talk  of my  parents 
coming. 

Q: Cause somebody had to know. 

A: Which I can™t remember. 

Q: Yeah.  
A: I -- there must have been something in th
e air, and I might not have chosen  to know it 
in -- so as not to be disappointed . But, I 
said, my  parents have come. And Mrs. Cohen 
looked at me and waited for me to do -- 
Q: Something. 
A: -- something. I mean, just as I hadn™t
 cried efficiently, here I wasn™t happy 
sufficiently. So I -- she said, 
aren™t you happy, you fun
ny child. Sh e does noth ing but 
write letters home, and now I tell her, she™s not
 even  happy. So  then
 we got in the car, 
and on th e way I kept producing the drama that
 meant I was happy, because obviously I -

-  

Q: Right. 
A: -- I wasn™t -- I wasn™t -- what I felt was 
v ery clear to me. And I™ve had -- you know, i-
i-in -- in the movie, in ﬁInto the Arms of 
Strangersﬂ the number of people wh o have it -- 
describe something like this, the removal of 
a burden th at you didn™
t know you were c -- 
you were carrying. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
142 
 
 
A: You™re suddenly realize what
 it™s -- what it feels like to
 be a person. Y-Y-You haven™t 
known th at you were not, but you™re s
uddenly out from under. And the feeling is 
exquisite and does not expre
ss itself in ah ha ha ha. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: You know, it doesn™t express itself -- 

Q: Ri-Right. 
A: -- in the expressions o -- it™s true joy, and ha
d nothing to do with --
 with the things that 
-- that usually express. It seems to me s -- I™v
e said to students in my writing classes, one 
thing you can be sure of, when you feel real
 emotion, it will not be what you think it™s 
like. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Cause wh at you think it™s like is taken fro
m the last bit of prob
ably not very good 
literature. Whatever it is you™re 
going to be feeling, you w
ill be astonished. And you will 
-- or at least I didn™t, never manage to be
have in that expect
ed literary fashion. 
Q: You know, your mother, wh
en she was interviewed for th
e film, said when you left, 
nobody could speak. The film ju
st says, I didn™t speak wh en I came home, but if you read 
the full testimony -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- that they didn™t incl ude, she said, nobody spoke. 
A: She said my father went, lay down in 
the bed and s -- s -- lay perfectly still -- 
Q: Still, right. 
A: -- and unspeaking and unmoving fo r days. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
143 
 
 
Q: Right. So is that not feeling? I mean, clearly it™s -- 
A: Well, but is that what you 
would expect? I mean, if you -- 
Q: I don™t know. I don™t -- I don™t know wh at -- 

A: What you don™t -- you don™
t know what, is the answer. 
Q: Right. 

A: You don™t know what. And y
ou know, our -- I have learned 
to really let people ex -- 
feel what they feel -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- without -- without assuming that I know what it is. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Or waiting for a particular -- I mean, it™s w
onderful to wa -- watch movies of the 40™s 
and 50™s, where everybody does 
exactly [indecipherable] what
 they™re supposed to do. 
Q: Right. 
A: It™s not so any more, I think. 
We are much more subtle now.  
Q: It™s true. 
A: Yeah? 
Q: It™s true, they were -- they were re
ally giving you a [indecipherab le] tell you -- 
A: They were telling what you can -- yeah. 
Q: -- what to feel. 
A: And then  people f -- when th ey didn™t do th at, thought, oh dear. 
Q: Right. 

A: I™m s -- I™m scared of messing up here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
144 
 
 
Q: Messing up is right. And no
w it™s much more nuanced. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: But is it -- 
A: And surp rising, yeah. 

Q: Right. Bu t somewhere you -- you wrote ab
out ur-geo graphy. Wh en
 you fir -- when  -- 
a-and the fact -- 
A: Oh th at, that™s about bedrooms. 
Q: Be -- yes, about bedrooms, but it also se
ems -- cause at the end you said something 
about Proust said it right. A says so
mething to B and B hears something. 
A: Oh yeah, that™s argument, that
™s -- that™s in the nature of 
-- of excha -- yeah, it™ll -- it™ll 
apply here perfectly well. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. 
Q: That wa -- one doesn™t know wh at the other person is really saying. 
A: No. 

Q: This is a little bit dist
ressing though, isn™t it? 
A: And oddly enough I -- I -- I have made that  
-- that funny connection. I as -- I -I -- se e, 

check yourself out. Put yourself in your be -- in your earliest bedroom.  

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know wh ere the door is, right? 
Q: [indecipherable] ente
ring, yes, absolutely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
145 
 
 
A: And my point was in that -- in that piec
e already, that we somehow assume that the 
other person knows our ur-bedroom. And if
 you don™t know my  ur-bedroom, there™s 
nothing else. Everything else 
i-is not clear to you.  
Q: That™s true. 
A: And the -- the -- I mean, it™s 
-- internationally, it is a disast
er  that we don™t know what 
the other person wants. 
Q: Wants. What they™re saying, yeah. 
A: And that they do -- that we don™t -- we
 don™t understand wh at -- what their meaning, 
or their -- their -- their need
s, or their wants are.  
Q: Are you -- I -- when I read that, I began 
to think about the ear
liest bedroom that I 
remember and exactly what it 
looked like and exactly where 
things are. And I rememb er 
explaining something to  somebody about th
e bedroom, but not -- they didn™t ask me 

where things were. But all that
 I see is where things are. 
A: Yeah, and I think I mentioned that
 -- that Ellen [indecipherable] -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- was -- was -- was eager to point out that
 what really mattered was that -- w h at is 
right and left. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And what is in front, because we didn™t
 -- we didn't  know. And we didn't know it 
because we thought everybody knew it. 

Q: Yeah, because -- 

A: It is so basic that it didn™t
 seem to need to be mentioned. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
146 
 
 
Q: So one thinks that wh
at one is saying -- that people know that wa -- 
A: I mean, I™m not going to  tell you th at my  head™s above my  -- my -- my  feet, right? 
Q: Right. 
A: You know that. 

Q: Right. 

A: But all that other stuff, you don™t know. 
Q: I don™t know. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 
A: I™d forgotten that essay. 
Q: It™s very nice. I read this -- I read it last night, it was -- it™s -- 

A: Huh. Hm.  

Q: -- wa -- why the things we 
tell each other seldom achieve direct hits. What we mean is 
likely to land, if it lands at all, to the right
 or left, or aslant of what we intended.  
A: What essay is this? What is [indeciphera
ble]. I remember -- I remember the thought 
then -- 
Q: ﬁOther People™s Hous
esﬂ, but it™s -- it™s -- 
A: Oh, it™s -- 
Q: But it™s w -- 
A: -- is it the in -- introduction, is it? 
Q: Well, you know, I know -- 

A: Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
147 
 
 
Q: -- I don™t -- I don™t know if it™s from the introduction beca --  
A: If it™s not in --  
Q: Maybe it is. 
A: -- it™s not in the body. 

Q: No. 

A: Cause that™s a much -- mu
ch later thought than -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- I mean, I didn™t -- 

Q: This is when you 
were in Ohio State. 
A: Yeah, I don™t remember.  

Q: So, I don™t know what the date of 
this is. I didn™t recall reading this. 
A: I remember writing it, but I 
had forgotten [indecipherable] 
Q: It™s quite lovely, it™s really lovely. So,you se -- oh, okay, let™s change the tape.  
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

Beginning Tape Eight 
Q: So, what was it like to see your parents? What -- 
A: I™ve been sitting here trying to remember th
e first view of them, and I can™t remember 
that. 
Q: You can™t? 

A: It™s gone. 
Q: Do you remember sitting in 
the living room [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, I remember many, many moments, but not -- 
Q: The first. 
A: -- I mean, I™m trying to open this, like my friend -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- tried to recover the -- the -- the scene in 
the -- before I got in the train, I™m trying to 
open the door, I™m trying to  look and I don™t 
-- I don™t know it. What I remember is my  
mother™s eyes, which were 
huge and tear laden.  

Q: Mm. 

A: I reme mber my  father looking ill, sitting in a chair, not knowing wh at to do with 
himself, tending to echo what my mother said
. And I remember their leaving. I remember 
their l -- th ey stayed a couple 
of days and one of the things 
that happened on those couple 
of days was my  birthday party, with a whol
e lot of children from school. They  were not -- 
there was s -- ch-children from 
the street that I™d played
 with and children from the 
school, refugee children from the school. And 
the English children in
troduced games that 
I remember -- still remember 
with horror. One of them wa
s you were ba -- you were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
149 
 
 
blindfolded and then told a funny story, 
which included your pu
tting your finger on 
something and you -- and when  
you put your finger it was a -- 
a -- a -- an -- a tomato. So 
that you put your finger in something that wi
th in the story context was really disgusting, 
like an eye, you know. That™s
 what I rememb er. And I reme
mb er looking at my  mo ther, 
whose eyes were following me. Everywhere 
I went, my mother™s eyes followed me. I 
reme mb er my  mo th er co n stan tly
 th anking the Cohens, and my  father echoing the thanks 
that my mother was giving th
em. I remember that the neig
hbors collected money for my 
parents, who were about to go down south to -- 
Q: To Kent? 
A: -- Kent, to become -- to Kettles -- the pl
ace was called Kettlesell House, to be a -- a 
cook and a butler. And I rememb
er their leaving and I was standing at the top of the 
stairs, and I wouldn™t go down. I -- I w
ouldn™t go down  to embrace them. I was 
embarrassed. I was in some way confused by 
the double -- by the double family that I 
now belo nged to. And my  mo ther and my  fath
er standing there being -- about to be 
driven  to the train by one of the da
ughters, and I wouldn™t come down. 
Q: Hm. 
A: I have to  make that analogy. In  the movi
e, ﬁInto the Arms of Strangersﬂ there™s Erica, 
whose parents are about to arrive at the 
end of the war on the same train as her 
schoolmates and she can™t stand it. So she says
 -- sh-she™s about 13 - 
14, and she says, I™ll 
-- I™ll just run down and 
put the kettle on for tea. 
Q: Because it™s too much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
150 
 
 
A: One of the -- one of the sadnesses of th
ese stories are how hard  it was to become 
reunited with a broken family. 
It™s not -- I mean, you should think of what could be mo re 
blissful than to be reun
ited with your fa -- and it 
was. But it was complicated. 
Q: Right. 
A: It was unmanageable on both sides.  

Q: Was it worse then 
the children were older, or when wa -- 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: -- you don™t know. 

A: There™s a story -- and ag ain, one a -- one a 
-- one of the stories in ﬁInto th e Arms of 
Strangersﬂ where the -- the 18 year old pushes 
away his father™s hand from his hair. It -- 

it -- it™s -- it was -- it™s -- and 
I -- when -- when later on, when
 I rejoined my parents, I 
was disappointed th at they weren™t English. 

Q: That they weren't E nglish. 
A: They were not English, they were these 
oth -- these -- these peop
le from some -- some 
strange past of mine. I m
ean, I loved them, and I -- 
Q: Yes, yes. 
A: -- I wanted to be with them. Neverthele
ss, there was something the mat -- th ere was 
something wrong with them. 
Q: And you were already more 
English in some ways, I guess. 
A: I-I -- I th -- I knew how to serve tea in th
e drawing room and my 
parents were have -- 
ta -- kept having this coffee on the 
table. I -- I mean, that™s terrible. 
Q: Right, right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
151 
 
 
A: I mean, when you think 
back, I mean, there was a ti
me when I embarrassed and 
horrified at this. Now, I just look ba
ck on it as another one of those -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- one of those results -- 

Q: Did your mo ther talk to you about her me
mory of that first time that she met you -- 
she saw you after the -- 
A: She did. And wh at I™m telling you is
 now -- has -- contains -- or -- wa -- 
Q: Part of her story. 
A: -- her -- yeah. I -- I -- it™s -- it -- it was a -- 
it was a disastrous, wonderful visit, because 
I couldn™t -- I c -- y-you -- there wa -- there wasn™t an embrace that will do it, there 

wasn™t a kiss that would -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I mean, again, literature thinks -- or -- or  movies think that -- that -- that -- that -- 
that kiss, that embrace will -- will -- 
will close the deal, but it doesn™t. 
Q: It doesn™t. 
A: Y-Yeah. I have to really 
think more about that. Why that
 was, why the -- that -- those 
reunions were so regularly disastrous. And no
thing like as disastrous as the -- the -- the 
children who never saw their parent
s again, who never got over that. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I mean, and there were 
only 10 percent of us -- 
Q: Who had [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
152 
 
 
A: -- accor -- yeah, according to 
-- to some statistic that 
ever got reunited with our 
parents. 
Q: I don™t know, there must be -- there™s so
 much that™s unresolv ed, that seeing each 
other again doesn ™t res -- 
necessarily resolve it. 
A: Well, you know, I mean, al -- there™s enou
gh problems between parents and ch ildren -
- 
Q: I know. 
A: -- at best of times, and now 
you add -- you add a separation. 
Q: Right.  
A: And add the fact that the child that you ge
t back is three months older, or eight years 
older, and there has become -- has -- has 
acquired a bit of a different nationality. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And a lot of snobbery. A wall up of snobbe
ry. That one get -- that™s one one gets over. 
Q: That one gets over pretty quickly. 

A: By th e time you™re 80 you™ve got over th
e snobbery of that -- of those days. 
Q: You know, I once interviewed a woman wh
ose mo ther sent her to another family 
because she thought she would be  killed, so this way at least the ch ild would be safe. It 

ended up the mo ther lived, was reunited with
 the daughter. I met th e daughter when she 

was over 50. Sh e has never, ever 
forgiven her mother
 for giving her up, even  though she 
knows intellectually -- 

A: She no -- yes. 

Q: -- she did it to save her life, and her 
mother is alive and 
across the street.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
153 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] kn
ow that, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And she can™t -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So there™s some 
-- there™s someth -- 
A: Do you know in the movi
e ﬁSecret Livesﬂ, by Aviva Sles
in, about the children given 
away when they were -- Aviv
a herself was given away  to  
a -- a -- to a p-peasant woman 
when  she was two mo nths old and returned to
 her mo ther when  she was three years old. 
Q: Oh my God. 

A: That -- but that is not the subject of 
the film, but these -- but she takes other -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- hidden -- hidden children 
back. And that -- that™s -- it™s fascinating and complicated. 
Q: I should see it. I haven™t seen it. 

A: You must see it. 
Q: Yes. 
A: It™s a -- it™s better th an this film. [inaudibl
e] No, this is good, bu
t -- but that -- that -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- is very extraordinary. 
Q: Right. Your parents go to  Kent -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- to be a -- a cook and a butler. 
A: Cook and a butler. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
154 
 
 
Q: Although your father ends up being too sick
ly to really do very
 much, or he™s also 
[indecipherable] 
A: My father was too sick, my father was 
-- I -- I think it happens so often that the 
women were more agile, more 
adaptable, more adventurous in a way, more willing. My 
mother was a -- became a wond erful cook. She liked -- sh
e liked the lady she -- she 
worked for, to some degree. 
She -- my father -- you know, I have a memory, I don™t 
know whether that™s in ﬁOther
 People™s Ho usesﬂ or not, of visiting, when  I eventually 
visited my  mo ther at the school holidays. 
I remember sitting in 
the kitchen when my 
mother was in the scullery, and my  mother was wash -- 
maybe it is in there -- was 
washing dishes. And I looked in bec -- and th
e steam w as rising, a nd in the steam was my 
mother whistling in the sweet
est ma -- most b eautiful -- 
she was a wonderful whistler. 
She was whistling some -- someth
ing, I forget what, but it 
was extraordinarily lovely. 
Now, there was nothing -- actually, my father 
did like nature. This 
-- this man from the -- 
from the bank -- from the -- h-he did like the 
chickens. He did like pottering at -- put-
puttering around. But he was ill, h e was not 
able to -- to use the language he knew. He 
was within -- within a -- 
a couple of months of having -- having a stroke. 
Q: Right.  

A: And he could not understand
 ho-how you wait at table, gi
ving food from the left and 
taking away from the right. Left and right were beyond him in that -- 
in that condition. So 
my  mo ther would do the cooking, take off he
r kitchen -- kitchen -- kitchen apron, put on 
the service apron and wa -- go 
in and serve fo r him and come
 back and take off the c -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
155 
 
 
put on th e other ga -- and make the next -- ne
xt course and go in  a
nd serve it. He could 
not . He could not. 
Q: Was -- is it an accu rate portrait in the book
, of your frustration with him? Is -- is -- 
A: Yes, I™m sorry to say, yes. 
Q: -- is that -- 

A: Yes. Well, I was -- 
Q: I mean, you were a kid, after all. 
A: -- I was on my mother™s side -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- and I could see that he was ma
king her life -- she didn™t say that. 
Q: Right. 

A: I™m not sure that she™s -- thought it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But I saw it. I saw that he was making 
her life yet mo re difficult. And you know 
where I saw it? Later on in Guilford. The Je
wish doctor saw it. He saw that she was 
wearing herself. Wasn™t even 
aware that she was doing all the housework, going to  visit 

him in the hospital, going b
ack to cook dinner and co
ming back in  the mo rning. 
Q: Yeah. Right. 
A: He, at point, forced her into a holiday
. So I was not the only person who saw -- 
Q: Who saw that. 

A: -- that what -- the -- the -- the we
ight she was carrying was beyond --  
Q: [coughs] Excuse me. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
156 
 
 
A: -- beyond the possible. But I was very angry at my father  for being ill, for making life 
so hard for her. For the unreas -- his unreasonabl
eness, in his illness. I have thought that 
my father™s illness, in the weig
ht, in the -- in the -- in the dr
ead of it, was as bad as Hitler. 
I mean, the experience of Hitler was no worse th
an the experience of 
my father™s ongoing 
illness. Those two things seem to
 carry -- have been as -- one 
as -- as heavy as the other. 
Q: That™s interesting.  
A: I said the -- someth ing like th
is to my class. I -- I teach 
a class in creative writing at -- 
for the 92
nd
 Street Y, and I said something about
 this. Somebody asked me about it. And 
one of my  students began to cry. Sh e 
said, my brother is ill like that.  
Q: I don™t know wh at to say to that one, beca
use it -- it would appear as if the historical 
weight of what the Nazis were 
doing was mu ch 
heavier than -- 
A: Of course it is. 

Q: Of course. 
A: Of course. 
Q: However, your experience of it is not so we
ighted on the Hitler side -- I mean, it™s par 
-- it™s -- it™s partly that you -- 
A: I think if I had been  in 
-- in the -- in the camps -- 
Q: The camp, you wouldn™t say it. 
A: -- I would not be saying that. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think 
that™s what I™m thinking. 
A: Yeah. But let me sa
y that the emigration, the Kindertransport -- 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
157 
 
 
A: -- was no heavier than my
 father™s ongoing illness. 
Q: Right.  
A: And no -- ma-maybe it™s -- ma y-maybe it™
s -- it™s foolish to try and weigh these 
things, but it -- I™m really only 
expressing the immensity of -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- of my father™s -- of the illn
ess, my father™s illness and -- 
Q: It™s -- 

A: -- everything. An -- 

Q: It™s very clear that everything is colored by that, right? 
A: Yes, yeah, it is. I used to -- I had this notio
n, I think I describe it, I had that notion that 
things never happen wh en you expect them
, or from the direction in wh ich you™re 
looking for them. Which resulted 
in my notion that if I kept
 imagining my f -- well, the 
things that could be happening
 to my  father at any given 
moment, that™s not what was 
going to  happen. Kept me once again like before
, very busy trying to  keep  on top of all 
possibility so that it -- 
to prevent it from happening. I me
an, h-he -- he had the -- he had 
strokes, one after the other. I was going to  
prevent another stroke by imagining him 

having a stroke. That™s hard wo rk. And there 
was my  mo th er at th at
 time, we™re now in 
Guilford. We™re -- we™re many -- many -- many 
ha -- e-events, many adventures later, 
and she™s working as a cook down in a subt
erranean kitchen, wh
ich I could look down  
into, because that -- th ere was a grate, right? 
So here™s my father, 
continuing to be -- to 
have -- to bother her by having strokes, an
d here she is down , wo rking in  the kitchen. 
Q: And you can™t stand it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
158 
 
 
A: And I can™t stand it. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And then  I would go visit him in -- in what
 was then the ward. I me
an, people la -- he 
lay in a bed, and in this direction and th is 
direction were other beds with men in them. 
And you -- they would get their food and y
ou would lo ok down -- lo
ok down  the row and 
you would see the mo use, like that. And I woul
d have my  -- I had my  bag here like that 
and I had my  hand in it on a book. And I kept 
wondering, I wonder if it™s okay for me to 

take out my book and read while I™m sitting 
next to my father who is now eating. I™m 
visiting him.  
Q: Did you? 
A: Never.  

Q: You never took it out? 

A: No, never took it out. And I ke
pt my  finger in the pages. 
Q: Did you talk with each 
other, or was it mainly s -- 
A: He was not -- he -- he kept saying that he
 wan t ed  my  mo th er to
 take him home. So I 
would yell at him, please don™t suggest that 
to her, because she™ll do it, right? Then  he 
said, I wish she would write to Paul -- my 
Uncle Paul, who had -- 
who had stopped short 
of getting a doctor™s certification, as if 
maybe my uncle™s information, medical 

information, could save him.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then  I would try to explain to him 
that this was not reasonable. That was our 
conversation. Not -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
159 
 
 
Q: Noth ing else. 
A: Nothing else. I pitied him. I was irritated 
by him. I wish he woul
d stop leaning on my 
mother. I wish I weren™t so bored. Ba
d. You know, I had another thought.  
Q: Mm-hm? 

A: I remember I thought neve
rmind about my being such a 
bad daughter. I will be old, 
and I will be ill and my children will 
not want to sit next to me.  
Q: And you -- and you™ll pay the price?  

A: I will pay -- 

Q: You thought of this at 10? 
A: I thought -- no, 10, I™m not 10 -- 
Q: 11, no you™re a little -- 

A: -- now, I™m 15 -- 

Q: -- all rig h t, 15. Still -- 
A: -- I™m [indecipherable] bi
g girl, I™m a -- I™m a -- 
Q: You™re a big girl, yes. 

A: [indecipherable] a big girl. And I™m, you kn
ow, I thought it™s okay, let me -- let me  
not give myself such a bad time, because th
ere will be a payoff. I would -- I would get a 
payback from this. 

Q: You™re in five different places in E
ngland, right? Five different homes bef -- 
A: The -- the -- the Cohens, who -- I think he
 was a manufacturer of furniture or se -- 
cellar furniture. Jewish Orthodox in Liverpool
. The next one was -- then I went to stay 
with my mother and father, who were being 
a married couple. The Cohens wrote and said 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
160 
 
 
-- Co-Co-Cohens have had it with me. And it 
was a [indecipherable], so they suggested 
that it might be happier for me to stay with
 them. And anyhow, they  had some aunt or 
some -- so mebody needed care. 
So my mother talked to th
e lady. These were called our 
ladies. 
Q: Our ladies, right. 

A: And the lady connected her with the -- 
with the Tumbridge -- 
the Tumbridge la --- 
church ladies™ Committee for Refugees, who 
found me a home with the Gillams. He was 
a railroad stoker. I mean, it™s so sweet to thin
k of somebody being a stoker. That meant 

he was the person who put the fuel in
 the place that makes the train go. 
Q: Train go, right. 

A: He was a -- a -- a union man, a -- a charmi
ng, witty fellow. He had a wife who played 
the piano. He ha -- who in -- sta -- stammered.
 And two daughters, one
 of whom I™m still 
in touch with -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- Mari. Mari -- oh, this is an interesti
ng story. I -- oh it -- probably shouldn™t even tell 
this story because it was told me in confid
ence, but it™s so long ago. There was also -- 
these are people, these are working class peopl
e who take in the Jewish refugee child and 
they also took in  the orphan from the orphana
ge. And the orphan from the orphanage was 
a horror. His name -- I call him Albert, I thin
k his name was Harold. And he was -- he 
was -- h-he really hated me, because I was th
e newest -- the newest member an-and a -- I 
can™t even do Harold. 
But we hated each other. And a -- 
at some point we were wa -- 
Mari and I went to go to the 
public school -- oh -- ra -- or the -- the -- th-the s -- city 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
161 
 
 
school, and we both won a -- a -- a -- a -- what 
do you -- what do you call it, a -- a -- a -- a 
-- we were -- both could have go
ne to the -- what she called th
e la-ti-da school, and told  
me that she wasn™t going to  go because it 
would -- it would betray her class. And I 
certainly didn™t care anything 
about betraying any class -- 
Q: Class --  

A: -- and I went. No w, many, many, many, 
many years later, I was in vi -- was in 
England and I -- Mari and her 
husband, a -- who was an engi
neer, a ship -- shipbuilder™s 
engineer, came to see me and I reminded her 
of this. And she said, that wasn™t why I 
didn™t go. I went because my
 mo ther told me that my  sister Joy had not made the 
examination and there would be bad blood in -- 
in the family if I went. So that™s why I 
didn™t go. I said, Mari, would you do the sa
me thing with your ch
ildren? She said, are 
you kidding? A-And -- well then Mari -- and th
en it was Mari -- what 
I said in the book, 
and what I believed was that 
the discrepancy between our e
ducation finally got too mu ch  
for the Gillams and they said I had to leave.
 They also had an au
nt, a blind aunt who 
needed to be taken care of. 

Q: Who came, right, right. 
A: So this is not in the book
 and I™ve never -- never -- this is not in public. Mari then 
went to the bathroom, and John, her husband,
 said to me, that was not why th ey -- you 
know why they sent you away? 
Because Harold attacked Mari and tried to rape her, and 

they wanted  to get you out of 
the house. So all this
 time  I have been  thinking of them in 
such a demeaning -- or such a m -- not de
meaning, cause they 
were very good, but 
minimizing way. Wh ereas what they did was to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
162 
 
 
Q: Was to protect you. Try to protect. Wow. 
A: If you really -- to judge other people™s mo tiv
es is just -- it™s a -- just a stupid thing to  
do. 

Q: Wow. 

A: And he said don™t tell her then, that they 
didn™t want you to know
 that. But I™m glad I 
know that. 
Q: Yeah, I am too.  
A: Anyway, they said I had to leave, and then
 I did this amazing thing. I borrowed Mari™s 
bicycle and went to the church 
ladies™ comm ittee and said I have to leave. And they gave 
me an address, and I -- I motor -- I motored ou
t -- I mean , I f -- I bicycl
ed out to this -- to 
this other family and interv iewed th -- you know, the -- I 
showed you a picture of the 
three little children?  

Q: Yes. 
A: Those were her children. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Sh -- He was a munitions worker and I 
-- I -- I literally interviewed her. She was a 
very simp le young woman. An
d I decided I would co me and 
stay with her. 
I lived with 
them long en ough fo r him to get -- you know, we
 do know that the war has started in the 
meantime, right? 
Q: Yes. 
A: The war has started , my father has been se
nt to the Isle of Man, my  Uncle Paul has 

been sent to the Isle of Man, beca
use here there were enemy -- enemy --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
163 
 
 
Q: Aliens. 
A: -- German speaking enemy aliens. 
Q: Right. 
A: I came -- went to live with -- wi -- wi -- I 
forget what their name
 was, but anyhow, he 
was sent to Croydon where munitions -- as a 
munitions worker, and th
ey sent me to live 
with her mother and father. They were old 
-- sweet, old people. He was a milkman. He 
had a pony with a little panel truck. And th
ese people -- you know, people take children 

and take children in. They had a daughter ca
lled Ruby who went -- who was a -- a ladies™ 
maid, I -- a -- across to wn, who went to stay w
ith a neighbor so that they could give me 
her room. I mean, these are -- you know, none 
of -- I-I™ve said, none of these people were 
really -- I -- I didn™t have a wonderful time wi
th any of them, but how amazing they were. 
So this Ruby goes to live next
 door. There are a batch of y
oung males in that family and 
they all live upstairs in the attic, to gether with
 a -- a -- a-a -- a -- a London -- what do they 
call them w h en they sell the 
children away from London? You 
know, to -- to -- to -- to 
avoid the blitz? 
Q: Oh. 
A: I™ve lost the word
 for the moment, but 
you know what I mean. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So th ere -- there are any number of people in
 this household. This is when my mother, 
who was -- had to le -- and I™m leaving out bits
, but -- but I -- let me fill in, when the war 
first started , England went into a -- into a panic. First my mother and father™s flashlights 

were taken. Flashlights and maps, in 
case they were going to give -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
164 
 
 
Q: Signals. 
A: -- signals to the enemy. Th
en they interned all male, 
German speaking en emy aliens 
over 16. The next rule was that women also
 could be spies and need ed to be moved 
inland from a certain mileage to
 the coast, so they wouldn™t 
give signals. So my  mo ther 
came and picked me up and we went to Guilf
ord, the last place where we lived, where 
she and I got -- she got a lovely 
job with this -- with the best
 family in the world. They 
were Scots, they were classy Scots. He 
was a architect and he 
lived -- he was a -- a 
national trust architect and lived in 
a s -- in a -- let me call it a 17
th
 century water mill. 
They lived in part of 
it, the other part was for public -- 
the public could 
go and -- and visit 
it. And these are still my very dear friends. 
We go -- we go visit. They come and stay 
with me, I stay with them. They
 are the s -- th e salt of the earth. The people without class 
consciousness.  

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: The upper class -- 
Q: The upper class [indecipherable] 

A: The upper class Socialists. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So, [indecipherable] Socialists. 

Q: And your father is ill enough so they sent
 him out of the Isle of Man and he co mes to 
Guilford, is that correct? 

A: Yes, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
165 
 
 
Q: And are we talking 1941 
now, ™42? ™41? We™re talki
ng about the attack on Poland 
now. 
A: ™41 -- ™41. 
Q: Yes. 

A: I -- I -- I -- I -- yeah [indecipherable] got the -- 

Q: Right. 
A: And I went to live with the church -- th-t
he -- the -- one -- one of the ladies working 
for the church committ
ee in Guilford. Miss Ellis and Miss Wallace. 
Q: Who were Protestant. 

A: High church. 
Q: High church. 

A: Protestant is -- 

Q: Episcopali -- 
A: Well, it™s not called Episcopalian, but High Church. 
Q: It™s High Church. 

A: Yes. Church of England.  
Q: Yes. 
A: Church of England. 

Q: We have to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Eight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
166 
 
 
Beginning Tape Nine 
Q: You were starting to talk about the last
 house you were in, with the High Church 
women. 
A: Can I tell you about a one that preceded this? 

Q: Sure, absolutely. 

A: Because I have not written about it at all.
 This was upstairs and downstairs. I lived 
down stairs in upstairs anddo
wnstairs. It was an 
extraordinarily grand house, with seven 
garden ers gardening the -- 

Q: Seven? 
A: Seven gardeners and a butler and a hous
ekeeper and my mother
 was the cook and 
there were any number of ladies™ maids. An
d there was the cook™s little daughter staying 
over. And you would have thought -- you know, th
is was th-the -- this -- this was the real 
McCoy, except it wasn™t. Except that the lady of
 the house was, I think an -- an old -- an 
old prostitute who was living there with he
r new young man and th
e -- and the husband 
was off somewhere in -- in 
the city. But otherwise -- 
Q: Otherwise it was -- 

A: -- it was the experience, you know, all that 
you learn in -- in ﬁUpstairs, Downstairs.ﬂ 
You know what I™m talking. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, I do.  
A: Wa -- that was how it was regulated. It was 
very interesting, or -- or God -- Godsford? 
It was Godsford. Th-The Altman movie. 
Q: Right, ri-ri-right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
167 
 
 
A: Anyhow, just want to put th
at in because that™s very -- it was very interesting to learn. 
Q: Now this was the only plac
e where your mo ther was work ing wh ere you were actually 
living, is that correct? 
A: I wasn™t living, I was visiting. 

Q: You were visiting. 

A: She was there only for a shor
t period, and I can™t quite fit 
in -- I -- I can™t -- you know, 
I don™t -- I™m -- I wasn™t good at dates, but -- 
I™m not good at dates, and I wasn ™t -- don -- 
don™t know how it fits in, but she was there fo
r several months and I stayed with her for 
several weeks. Y -- and then somehow at th
at point -- I think from there we went to 
Guilford. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I cannot put it in -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- in -- in -- in -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- in chronological order. 
Q: Right.  
A: But yes. So now I was livi
ng with Miss Wallace and Miss Ellis, two elderly ladies in a 
Victorian house, where again, there -- I -- 
I still sometimes look at the confusion of my 
dinner table and remember how Miss Ellis 
and Miss Wallace could or -- the orderly 
upper class procedures, you know, in family li
fe. I™ve never been able to repeat it, but I 
remember it. I rememb er liking it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
168 
 
 
Q: You liked it? 
A: Yeah, I liked. Miss Ellis ha -- always ha
 -- ho -- Miss Ellis was a -- was in her -- mu-
mu st have been in her 50™s, she seemed ve
ry old to me. I think the -- I think Miss 
Wallace -- I would now imagine Miss Wallace wa
s her companion, but that was never -- 
it was never brought up, there was never -- Miss 
Wallace drove an Austin with a -- with a 
tra -- what™s the seat that
 you ope -- sit in the back? 
Q: A trundle seat? 

A: Trundle seat. And it -- it had to be cranke
d up in order for it to
 go. Miss Ellis rode 
around to wn  on one of those high bicycles
, like -- like -- like en
e -- do you know the 
movie, wa -- one of my favorite movies, 
ﬁBlithe Spiritﬂ? If you ever see Madame Arcati 
ride some -- looked exactly like Miss Ellis. 

Q: Yes? 

A: I love that movie because it looks like Miss 
Ellis. And they had this formal h ousehold, 
Miss Ellis always loved babies, and sh e alwa
ys had an -- a maid, who had an illegitimate 
baby to -- which she could bring in to the li-
living -- in-into the drawing room, we didn't  
have a living room, it™s the drawing room, in or
der to play with. And 
upstairs there was a 
study for the canon. Canon O™
Malley, or canon something 
from the -- from the -- Miss E-
Ellis™s church. It -- I -- I have -- you know, 
I have said, and I thin
k I might have shocked 
people to say that I find it simply am -- wond
erfully amazing and -- and terrific that I got 
to the -- live the inside life of 
all -- of the class system of
 England, which mo st people 
don™t get to do. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
169 
 
 
A: I mean, you visited as -- you 
visited, you are a -- a tourist. But I was a me mber of the 
household, I was a child just barely less th
an the child of the fa
mily, but almost like 
[indecipherable]. For instance, 
Ellis at -- I didn™t have a nu
rsery for me [indecipherable] 
chil -- but I ate -- I didn't eat -- I ate breakf
ast and lunch with them
, but dinner in the 
kitchen with the -- wa -- or th
e -- some -- so me memory of 
how children are treated in a 
household. 
Q: Huh. So it wasn™t just because yo
u happened to be this refugee kid? 
A: No. 

Q: No. This was the way children -- 
A: But -- that was the way children -- yes, 
this was the way child
ren -- I mean, read -- 
read -- read Henry James, the children co
me down -- or -- or -- or Jane Austen -- 
Q: Right, right, right. 
A: -- children are coming after dinner. 
Q: Right. 
A: Of course, I was too old to have -- have 
a governess, but they tried to rec -- recreate 
that world. I-I mean wa -- not tr
ied, I mean, that was the na -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the na -- the na -- way for it to be in. 

Q: But you were also quite amaze
d that these people, in spite of the fact that you said you 
weren™t very  nice, you weren™t easy to be ar
ound, that these people opened th eir houses 
to you, and he -- 

A: I -- it wasn™t that I wasn™t
 nice, I was merely a child -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
170 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- who was being a child. I was not -- I 
was not a -- I was not a darling little girl. 
Q: Right. But -- 

A: But I™m amazed at the -- I™m amazed -- 

Q: That they were opened -- 

A: -- and they didn™t -- yeah, and some of th
em got tired of me a
nd got rid of me after 
several months, but the -- but Miss Ellis kept 
-- they kept me there for -- well, fr-from 12 
to -- til I w as sixt -- fo ur years. 

Q: Four years? 
A: Miss Wallace, who was the -- she was th
e member of the c
hurch committee, she 
bought a house in -- she bought two houses.
 She bought one house in which sh e housed 
English gentry who had lost their money,
 and she bought a house for people like my  
mother and father and other refugees.  

Q: Really? 
A: I mean, that™s amazing.  

Q: It really is amazing. 
A: That is amazing. There was a -- a meeting 
where -- where the refugees met at. In fact, 
it was the auditorium of my -- of my high 
school that I -- that I went to, where the 
refugees met on Thursdays, which 
is the maid™s day off, day out. 
Q: Mm-hm. And so you could see your mo ther.  
A: I could see my  mo ther. I could also run 
across to Albury Lodge, 
which the -- the house 
that -- that Miss Wallace had bou
ght and go visit my mother 
and my f-father there. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
171 
 
 
there you see you have the difference between 
all these -- all these -- 
all these Jews living 
together and here was my  -- 
my  upper class, English -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: It took so me getting over.  

Q: To get at -- to be -- 

A: I mean, the orderliness, th
e handsomeness of the furn iture. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: It was a -- i-it was the class -- I was playin
g -- I was living out the class -- class system 
of -- 
Q: Of the -- of the -- 
A: -- class world of England. 

Q: What do you think motivated all th
ese people to -- because especially -- 
A: Virtue. 
Q: Virtue, all of them? 
A: Christian -- 

Q: It™s Christian virtue. 
A: -- virtue. Now, it didn™t make them loving and -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- and -- and -- but it made them take us 
in. Miss Ellis -- you know, I have an image in 
my mind. When I began to menstruate, I ha
ve an evening where Miss Ellis is sitting, 
sewing me my  -- what do you call them? 
Q: Napkins, or [indeciphe
rable] or whatever -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
172 
 
 
A: Nap -- yeah, sanitary napki
ns, she sewed them for me. 
Q: Sanitary. Really? 
A: I mean, that is this -- this
 -- that is amazing, isn™t it? 
Q: It is amazing.  
A: It™s a very m
oving, I think -- 
Q: Did she explain to  
you? Did you know what 
was going to happen? 
A: Well, you don™t want to hear that story, 
that™s just everybody -- 
every girl has a story 
of -- of --  
Q: The story. 
A: -- of being shocked and surp rised. 
You don™t want to hear that story. 
Q: It™s certainly shocking, yes. 
A: But there she was, taking care of it once -- 

Q: Right. So it wasn™t your mother, it was her. 
A: It was her, yeah. I was living -- that™s where I was liv ing. 
Q: Right. I didn™t hear -- 

A: By the way, I just wanted to say someth
ing ab out the -- maybe this is [indecipherable] 
these wonderful people in the mill, the M
acGregors. They not onl
y -- they took one look 
at my  mo ther and said, oh you come and eat
 in the dining room with us. Wh en you 
finished cooking, you come in and eat 
with us. Then my 
father had his n
th
 stroke and was 
in the hospital and came out of the hospital. 
They said oh, let him 
come in -- yous -- he 
can s -- live with us. And I was welcome to 
play with the children. That was a house -- 
this was during the worst bombing in London, 
th-the blitz in London. And ev ery weekend 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
173 
 
 
this house was open to people 
from -- who were tired of be
ing blitzed. They would come 
out the week and spend the week
 in the -- in the mill. If th
ere weren™t enough beds then 
you just put -- you put mattresses on th e floor 
and there were always enough coats to 
cover people with. That™s the kind of people 
they were, they really
 a -- th-they were and 
are extraordinary. These were people who were
 -- y-you see, they were good in the way 
m-mo st o f  my  -- my  m-m -- fo st
er parents were not. They did their duty, but these people 
did their duty out of some -- out of some
 -- some heart -- un-unthinking heart.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I always -- I -- I love them. I -- I really
 think they were -- th
ey were -- they were 
extraordinary. It™s -- it™s it 
-- almo st a -- a -- almost a view
 of what -- what the world 
could be like. 

Q: Right. 

A: First of all, the mill is
 absolutely gorgeous, and -- an
d -- and it™s built over -- over a 
wa -- a running water, with the mill wheel, 
though broken, still -- 
still there, and the 
watercress growing on the side. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: I mean, it™s just physically beautiful. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we all -- we go spe
n d  su mmers th ere so metime .   
Q: Do you? Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
174 
 
 
A: Yeah. But there™s a great difference betw
een that kind of goodness and that other 
principled  goodness. I mean that differe
nce -- I™m making the difference there. Miss 
Wallace certainly was -- was -- was 
good-natured and -- and -- and -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- careful. Miss wa -- Miss Ellis, the older 
one was -- was not. She was doing her duty.  
Q: But you benefited from
 all these different -- 
A: Oh, it -- 

Q: -- [indecipherable] in -- in extreme ways. 

A: -- and I -- as I -- as I then add, I have 
not done the same. I have not taken in alien 
children. Most of us don™t do that. 
Q: Most of us don™t, no. 

A: Most of us don™t. Mo st of us have perf
ectly good reasons for not
 doing it, but they did 
it. The Cohens, the Gillams, the -- all 
of them, and -- and I find it amazing.  
Q: It is ama -- when you thin
k about how many people have -- 
A: Think what -- I think what it™s lik
e to have a child in your house. 
Q: Right. 
A: You know, I didn™t have to be
 a nasty child, I was just a child. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: And all that involves and all the -- all th
e thought, all the -- a
ll the -- the -- the noise, 
the mess. And th en they  go and menstruate. 

Q: And then  they go 
-- and then they become
 young women, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
175 
 
 
A: Yeah. I tho -- I think they were -- I think 
the English were just 
wonderful, they were 
won -- ama -- wa -- 
amazingly wonderful. 
Q: Were you following the war very carefully? 
A: I was hearing the bombs. Guilford was 
on the route from London 
to wherever the -- 
the -- the bomb
ers came from. 
Q: So you could hear the bomb ers. 
A: So you see a double -- a double -- ah, you 
would see our bombers fly in this classic 
formation, to bomb what they
 were going to bomb. In  th
e mo rning we would open the 
windows and watch them come b ack and you 
would see where there were holes in the 
formation. You could coun
t how many had been --  
Q: Been shot down. 
A: -- had been shot down. Mean wh ile, the bo
mb ers flying back , woul
d very often unload  
-- unlike Graf Bobby, they would unload and 
we would very often have bomb s in the 
vicinity. They were not -- we were not target
s, but they  would unload  befo re they flew 
back. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There was a lot of bombing. I remember ly
ing in bed thinking, wh
ere there ever be a 
time where there will not be bombs droppe
d? Later in the war, there were the 
doodlebugs. Do you remember? D o  you hear 
about? They were self-propelled and they 

made a very particular noise, they went bzz, 
bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, and then they  stopped. 
And we were, at that p o int already knew you -- 
I forget, you ca -- a co
unt of five and they  
would explode.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
176 
 
 
Q: Hm. 
A: And that™s when you wonder
ed whether you were the one 
they  were exploded  on top 
of. 

Q: And were you -- were you hearing ru mo
rs about concentration camps and killing 

centers? 

A: I can™t remember w h en that became conscious. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: That is Ruth Kluger™s. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Her story of -- of the -- of th -- her shoc
k at the unwillingness of the Jews in England 
and in America to -- to
 want to hear -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to want to think about that. 
Q: Right.  
A: I don™t know -- 

Q: You don™t know. 
A: -- the answer to that. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I am -- I am shocked that I 
don™t know the answer to that. 
Q: It™s possible nothing was -- 

A: Now wa -- the -- but England a -- is in the war in a way that really, the States don™t -- 

Q: We™re not, obviously , of course.

A: Miss Ellis -- when -- when France fell, Miss -- the -- 
they create -- they were -- 
imagine of -- pieces of concrete, about this hi
gh with ab -- as -- a 
pole of iron. Imagine 
four of them. Imagine those po
les connected with 
barbed wire, and th
ey went across the 
whole of England, incl
uding through Miss Ellis™s rose gard
en, to keep out the invasion, 
the -- the German a -- the Germans. Miss el 
--  Miss Wall ace, she™
s the one who -- the -- 
the -- the member of the ref
ugee committee, collected our refugee™s paper, put them in 
boxes, ready to bury  them, so
 that the nat -- the in -- the 
incoming Nazis would not -- 
Q: Look at them. 
A: -- identify the Jews.  
Q: Hm. 
A: I mean, it was, in -- in a sense that you 
were about to be invaded. That it didn™t happen 

was, I think a surprise
. They  would change the names of
 ro -- of streets. They would 
rearrange street names to -- 
Q: To confuse. 
A: -- to confuse. It just a -- it just ha
ppened now to happen, but -- but England was 
entirely -- and there was the Home Guard. My mo ther was so anxious to play her part that 
she and m -- an-and my  singing teacher from scho
ol were Home Guards together to -- to 
walk up and down the street. 
And she did -- see, this is wh
ere m -- w h ere my fa -- where I 
was angry with my father. My father had lost the lo -- was becoming -- a -- e -- couldn™t 

walk any more, couldn™t -- he -- he was b
ecoming senile. And my  
mo ther did not only 
her own evening, but his as well. My mo
ther paid the -- the 
-- the -- the refugee

committee paid for my private school and my mo
ther insisted on giving them 15 dollars a 
month. 
Q: That™s a lot of money. 
A: I still have the -- 15 shillings, 15 shillings. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I still have the roster of -- of her paym
ents, which is really very touching. She 
absolutely wanted 
to  do everything that was possible to
 be part of th e -- of the solution. 
Q: Right, right.  
A: And -- except here. Here is where we -- he
re is where we differ. One of the other miss 
-- miss -- Mrs. Biddle of the refugee committee,
 when I had finished high school, called 
me in and said you know, your mother is work
ing, your father is so ill -- I had applied for 
college and got into c -- Univ
ersity of London. And she sa
id, you know you can™t go. 
You know th at, don™t you? You have to go to
 work . And I went home and said to my  
mother, she doesn™t -- she thinks I™m not going
 to go to college. Sh
e thinks I™m going to  
work. My mother said
, oh, it™s just ridiculous. Ridiculous. 
Q: Ridiculous, you go to  school. 
A: Thinking about -- what™s sh
e talking about? Of course 
you™re going to college. The 
mindset, the Jewish mi ndset. 
Q: So is this the end of the war? 
A: This is towards 
the end of the war. 
Q: Towards the end of the war. 
A: Yes. ™45 -- I went to college in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
179 
 
 
Q: In ™40 s -- 
A: -- ™45. 
Q: ™45. 
A: Yes, right. 

Q: And your father passe
s away a week bef -- 

A: The -- what -- what was the last -- I don™t kn
ow wh at is the last day of the last week. 
Literally, the week before the 
end of the European war. I mean, the Japanese war went on 
for some time. 

Q: Right, right. But I think it™s May fifth or something, 1945. 
A: ™45, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So he dies before it. 
A: He dies the week before.  
Q: And going back to  what™s cons
tant in this story, is you™re trying -- you would tr -- you 
started walking, trying to cry. 
A: I did have a paroxysm of crying wh en
 I first heard, and then I couldn™t. 
Q: You couldn™t. 
A: Couldn™t do it any mo re. 
Q: But there must have been some relie
f as well, because it was so difficult. 
A: Well, the relief takes one of the evil forms.
 I dream of hearing my father™s tap tap of 
his stick and I™m appalled. And 
wake up feeling monstrous.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

Q: There™s no end, is there? No.  
A: After my father died, my mother had a 
brief breakdown of her own, but it took the 
form of buying a pink dress, and almo st acqui
escing in having an  affair with his doctor, at 
least going around th e block with hi
m, and being invited to coffee. 
Q: Oh, good. 

A: But she -- she couldn™t -- 
Q: She didn™t -- she couldn™t do it.  
A: -- she couldn™t -- she couldn™t do 
it. Bu t she did buy the pink dress. 
Q: That™s great. 
A: She to ld me, I bought a pink dress. I said, 
you mean a dull pink. She said, a pink dress.  
Q: Pink dre -- 
A: I mean, she wore it twice and then -- and th
en ab andoned it, but -- you see, when  I tell 
my students, assume that wh
en something happens you will 
not react the way you think, 
it™s only another example. 

Q: Right. A pink dress. 

A: With -- with white dots. 
Q: With white dots. That™s quite amazing. 
Now, your mother -- you -- am I wrong? Was 
Paul in England also? Uncle Paul? 

A: Paul -- Uncle Paul came to 
England with his wife Edith. 
Q: Uh-huh, the one who was -- 

A: A very  beloved, a very, 
very  passionate young -- young
 love. They were in the 
midlands, he was working as a farm
er. He was over 60 and he was a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
181 
 
 
Q: That he was [indecipherable] yes, right. 
A: -- a German speaking enemy alien. He fi
nds himself in -- on th e Isle of Man with 
Edith still somewhere a
nd speaking not a word 
of English, in the midlands, living on a 
farm where she knows nobody 
and there™s nobody -- now this 
is that moment when the -- 
wh en  so meb ody  co mes to  th e 
camp  and says, who would lik
e to go to the Dominican 
Republic, and ev erybody says, in the wh
at? Who™s heard the Do minican Republic? 
Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: And Paul says, will I 
be reunited with my wife and they say sure. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That™s how -- 
Q: And that™s how he got s -- 

A: -- Paul gets to the Dominican Repub
lic. When he -- he got there -- domin -- 
Dominican Republic was -- was th
e attempt to set up -- make up a settlement of -- of t -- 
European farmers, taught by American e
xperts on goodness knows what, certainly not 
tropical farming. And I c -- I c 
-- this is too long a story, th
ough it™s awfully interesting. 
You should -- you sh ould have somebody talk to
 you about [indecipherable] really -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- it™s really -- but that™s a whole -- that™s it
s own story. Edith died  of -- I -- in the store 
-- in the -- in the -- see, this is
 what you can do with a novel. 
I -- I -- I did not want to put 
Paul thro ugh wh at actually happ
ened, so what -- I made her die in childbirth, which is not 
what happened. Sh e was pregnant, but died  actually of blood poisoning. 

Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
182 
 
 
A: After having touched a -- a -- a spot on her 
face, and I think blood poisoning is a s -- is 
a si -- a s -- you know, grows as rapidly as th
e pla -- as tropical plants. By the time they 
got her to Puerta Plata to the 
hospital, she was already dying or
 dead. And as I say, I think 
they hurried up -- m-my
 theory is, my theory
, my belief, my fantasy, my knowledge is 
that they got Paul his parents. Th
at -- that -- th at th-they got out -- 
Q: Because -- 
A: -- yeah. 
Q: -- because [indecipherable] 

A: He was going to  go crazy, I think with his 
grief and -- and -- and when my unc -- Paul 
found that he could not physically do the land 
work. So they set up 
in a shop for him, 
called Productus [indecipherable] where th
e -- where the cheese and sausages and 
whatever were sold in the ne
arby middle -- mid-mid -- little 
town called Santiago de los 
Caballeros. And my -- when my grandfather 
became ill, Paul called my mother who was 
-- she and I were living in London, I was going 
to University of Lond
on, to please come 
and help. Help in the shop, he
lp  with my  grandfather. And 
my -- and we agreed that I 
would finish -- get my  degree and then join  my  mo ther. 
Q: Right. 
A: All this time we were waiting for the Ameri
can quota. I mean, it 
t o ok us from August 
™38 til May ™51 for the quota to come through.
 But one of my -- one of my thoughts these 
days is, if -- this was ™48, if it had been ™78,
 I would have said to 
my mother, I really like 
it in England. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
183 
 
 
A: I™ll come visit. Never oc -- what in
terests me is it never entered my mind -- 
Q: That you wouldn™t go. 
A: -- that I could say that to her. It isn™t th
at I fought valiantly to
 -- to do what I had 
promised, it never occu rred to me -- 
Q: To not go. 

A: -- that -- that I had that choice. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I think that really is a -- a -- a di
fference of the decades, don™t you think? 
Q: Probably, yes 
A: That a -- a g -- a -- a young woman of 21 -- of 20 -- 
Q: Would stay in England, why would -- 

A: -- would -- would stay in England if she chose to stay in England. 

Q: Right. So  you finished your degree -- 
A: So I finished my degree. 
Q: And f -- wa -- followed and went to Dominican Republic. 

A: Went to the Dominican Re
public via Trinidad by -- by bo
at to Trinidad. There were 
only three flights a week from Tr
inidad to the Dominican Rep
ublic. Just to give a sense 
of it -- 

Q: Yeah, right, right. 
A: -- of the changing of -- I went to stay with
 my uncle -- with -- with
 -- with the -- with -
- with the f-family in S-Santiago
. It was interesting that they
 would not let me help in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
184 
 
 
in the shop. It was st
ill assumed that I was made for be
tter things. It™s -- it™s funny. My  
mother worked ther
e, my  grandfather work ed  there, my  grandmother -- 
Q: Everybody work ed -- 
A: -- everybody. It never occurred to them. 

Q: That you should -- 

A: Another things that doesn ™t occur to peop
le, right? Didn™t occur to them I was going to 
be a shop girl. I was g o ing to 
go to  sh -- to [indecipherab le], live there and teach English. 

Q: But not work  
in the shops. 
A: Not work . Didn™t occur to
 me, didn™t occur to them. 
Q: I -- I have a stupid questio
n to ask you. Did your mo ther ever ask you about the 

sausage? 

A: Well, I started wri -- I mean, sh e read it -- 

Q: And you wrote -- she read it. 
A: -- in the book, yes. 
Q: And did she say oh, this is what -- 

A: She was, of course, fascinated by the book. 
Q: Yeah, I bet. 
A: Which is dedicated to her. No, she didn™t
 -- I-I mean, I don™t think the sausage meant 

to her what it meant to me. 
Q: Meant to you, yeah. 
A: She didn™t think, oh here if I give 
them a sausage. That
 was my experience. 
Q: Yeah, it didn™t became an icon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

A: Yes. For her not at all. 
Q: Right. We have to change the tape.

Beginning Tape Ten 
Q: I think what we™ll do is we™ll close off th
is part of the interview and I will come to 
New York and interview you 
on your life after the war. But I do know that you went 
from the Dominican Republic w ith your mother to 
the United States in
 1951. But pre -- 
A: Well, let me go back a little bit. 
Q: Yes. 
A: My -- my Uncle Paul -- my fath
er had died  in England in ™45. 
Q: Right. 
A: My uncle™s wife Edith died
 in the Dominican Republic at
 age 21. My f -- grandfather 
died in the Dominican re -- 
is buried in the Do minican Republic, in 40-so mething. My  
father had put our name down 
on the American quota in ma -- in August ™38, and our 

quota came through in ™51. Bu t it ca -- it
 came -- th-the quota was -- was given out 
depending on land of birth. So  my  grandmothe
r went -- came to ing -- to New York first. 
My Un cle Paul -- she was Hungarian quota. My
 Uncle Paul was on the -- on the Viennese 
quota, came next, and my  mo ther and I came ne
xt. So the remnant of the family , whoever 
was leftover and hadn™t died, a
ll came to New 
Yo rk by 1951. 
Q: And were you on the Viennese quota as well? 
A: I was on -- my mother and I were on th
e -- both on the Viennese quota, yeah. 
Q: Oh this -- right. 
A: But it also depended on wh en you had 
put your name on this -- on this list. 
Q: Right. 
A: Or goodness knows what else it depended  on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
187 
 
 
Q: But life in New York  was not so easy. 
You didn™t -- you -- you all had to wo rk in  
various places for a long time -- 
A: Oh yes, yes  
Q: -- before you could do -- 

A: Oh yes, and -- and I thought, because I 
had this degree in -- in th -- in English 
literature I was going to ge
t some wonderful job. 
Q: Right. 

A: But what I ended up was filing. 

Q: Right. 
A: In Queens, in a shoe factory. Badly. 
Q: Badly. Cause that™s not your thing. 

A: No, I™m not good on 
-- on -- on filing details.  
Q: But you -- you™re s -- very st
rong desire as a very young ch
ild of nine or 10 years old 
to become a writer, became true. 

A: Oh yes. And I had been writing by the -- 
I mean, in a way I been writing since 1938 -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- in sa -- no, in ™
39 I was already writing.  
Q: Right. 
A: And in -- in -- when I came to the 
-- to New York, I -- I discovered, because 
somebody asked me a question, 
somebody asked m -- I kept thinking I™ve got nothing to 

write about. Finished. I™ve shot my wad. I have
 not been in love, I™ve not died, what di -- 
what -- what -- what am I supposed to write 
about? An d then I was -- I went to the -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
188 
 
 
went to a -- the new school fo-for social re
search and to ok a course in creative writing. 
And in one of those se
ssions, or rather in a party afte
rwards, somebody said, so how did 
you come to the Un ited States? And I had be
en thinking that everybody knew all those 
stories. You saw them on the newsreels. 
I knew them, everybody I knew knew them. 
That was nothing to  write about, but being as ked that question, how did you get here, I 
began to tell my  stories. And the room was 
silent. And I had the experience, which I™ve 
had often since, having been a teacher 
of me talking, other people listening. 
Q: Right. 

A: Delicious. 
Q: It™s delicious, yes. 
A: So I realized I actually did have a th
eme and I began to  write the stories.  
Q: Right. 

A: In -- and when I first came 
in ™51, they didn't get publis
hed until -- ™62 they began to 
be published. 

Q: But they finally did. 

A: Yeah. They were published in ﬁThe New 
York erﬂ between ™62 and ™64 and then -- but 
look what a -- what 
a -- what a long -- 
Q: It™s a long haul. 

A: -- a long haul. 
Q: Right. Bu t some people never do, so it™s wonderful. 
A: No. Well, I was going to  write anyway, that would have -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
189 
 
 
A: -- that™s -- that™s al
l I™m really good at doing. So  [indecipherable] 
Q: Well, it™s been a pleasure 
to talk with you, really. 
A: Thank you, Joan . [indecipherab le] 
Q: And now what we™ll do is we™ll stop 
the camera and we™ll do some of the 
photographs. And th ank you very, very mu ch.  

A: Thank you for inviting me to do this. 
Q: You™re more than welcome. 
A: These are my mother™s 
parents, my  grandmother Ro
sa Stern -- Shtern and my 
grandfather Josey Shtern. Do 
you need mo re than that? 
Q: And they  surviv ed? 

A: And they  we -- my Uncle Paul was able 
to bring them from Vienna to the Do minican 
Republic even after the war started, I think in
 -- in 1940, which was 
a remarkable thing to 
manage. 
Q: Right. Ok ay. Do  you need  
me to [indecipherable] that? 
Q2: Okay, and who is this? 
A: This is my father™s moth
er, Gisele Groszmann, who di
ed -- she -- well, she and her 
husband died before my  mo ther
 was married -- my mother a
nd father were married. They 
lived in Pressbourg, and I know very little ab
out them, except that
 my mother was once 
mistaken for her. So maybe there was 
a little family resemb
le -- a non-family 
resemb lance. I think the greengrocer addr
essed my  mo ther as Gisele Groszmann. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522

Q: And who™s the child here? 
A: The child is Franzi, Franzi Stern. She is my -- my mother -- th -- 
the -- my mother as a 
little girl, and I want you to know that my 
grandmother made all her dresses fo r her. 
Q: Really? 

A: And the other one is my mother at, I woul
d say, she -- this is 
already in the United 
States, so it must be after fif -- after ™51. 
I can™t do arithmetic fast enough to figure, but 
this is -- this is how I remember h er. 

Q2: And wh en was this picture taken? 

A: This is my mother in her 
late 90™s. She died in -- a-at 
-- three months before her 101
st
 
birthday. Sh e disliked this picture very
 much, but it was taken by a painter called 
Katherine Kadish, who -- who loved my  mother
 and who thought she was very  beau tiful 

in her late old age. I love that picture. 

Q 2 : Ok ay , g o  ah ead . 
A: My mother lived in her own apartment on 
the ground floor of th e building in which I 
live on th e 12
th
 floor and sh e was able to stay at
 home until she was 
97, and only spent 
the last four years in a nursing home, quite
 close -- some  16 blocks -- 13 blocks out from 
where I live. 
Q: Great story. This one? 

Q2: Wh at™s this photograph? 
A: This is my father, Ignatz 
Groszmann. He was an accountant
 in a bank. He had been an 
officer in the Austrian army, 
briefly, I think. And my  mo th
er -- I -- my mother married 
him, firstly because he aske
d her, and secondly because he
 was not like all the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
191 
 
 
crude and joke-y  salesmen who came to 
my  grandfather™s stor
e in Fischamend and 
wanted to marry her.  
Q2: And who™s this little cherub? 
A: This is little Lore, age about four or fi
ve, I imagine, in -- in Hammerling Park, which 
was the park very  close to wh
ere we lived, which I went -- we
nt to see when I went back 
to Vienna and where I reme
mber the words, kina Jude
n, no Jews, during the Hitler 
period. 

Q2: And on the left? 

A: In the left, my father had -- always ha
d August off from his ba
nk job, and we would 
always spend a month in the Au strian Alps. Th
is is my father, mother and me biting my 
nails, because my parents had decided I needed 
some little other kid to
 play with and they 
got -- they  found -- somewher e found this little boy who was Hungarian, didn™t speak a 

word  of English.  
Q2: And wh at™s this photograph? 
A: These are my dolls. I™m not sure that I was th
at interested in ma --
 as babies, but I did 
like to arrange them. No, really. 
Q2: And this shot? 
A: Yes. 

Q2: What™s this? 
A: This is the ti -- a little older Lore, doing her homework. 
Q: How old do you think you are there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
192 
 
 
A: I would have to guess six, 
seven? I™m trying to  think of 
my  grandchildren, trying to 
guess how old I would be at that a 
-- at that -- w
ith that look. 
Q2: And this group shot here? 
A: It™s -- it™s -- it seems to be posed for 
-- for some very s-stiff photograph -- I™m sorry 
I™m screwing up. 

Q2: That™s okay. 
Q: That™s all right. No, no, no, it™s fine. 
A: Have you already d-d-di --this -- 

Q2: Who -- who is in the shot here? 
Q: Who is in the shot? 
A: Oh, oh. It™s my fath er on -- on the left, 
my  grandmother in the mi ddle, my  Un cle Paul 
standing behind -- who was then a medical 
stu d ent. Little Lore on the table and my 
mother, Franzi. This is a formal sh ot made
 for perhaps my  grandfather™s birthday or 
something like that. 

Q: And how old do you th ink you are? 

A: Three, two? Two or three. 
Q2: And wh ere was this document here?  
A: This is the lifesaving document. You w
ill see it says, this doc
ument requires no visa. 
And the attemp t to get visas and -- and -- and 
permits and everything at the same time 
was a -- an almost impossible job. So the 
-- the Kult-Kultusgemeinde in Vienna and the 
Bloomsbury House and the State Department in 
England cooked up this
 particular way of 
facilitating the -- the imi -- the emigration of 
children, but only child
ren without parents. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
193 
 
 
And this is the document that got me ont
o the Kindertransport and from Vienna to 
England. 
Q2: And wh at does this represent? 
A: It is actually not the camp to which we 
-- in -- in which we we
re housed while they 
were find -- trying to find foster parents for us, 
but it is the closest thing that exists today, 
or rather this is the only picture that -- that
 -- that I could find of such a camp, such a 
worker™s camp, which were used
 for the children. And this is
 the kind of view that I 
would have had -- that we woul
d have had from the bus, from the top of the bus, after the 
crossing the channel and arriving, this is th
e view we would have had, with the ocean 
behind it and this little -- little s -- little town 
of little -- little houses in which we were 
housed while we were in the camp.  
Q2: And what about this picture? 

A: The family Cohen, whom I -- my first fost
er parents, bought me
 a little coat and then 
they took me to the --
 to the photographer to have a pi
cture to send to my  parents and I 
was 11 years old, or almo st 11. This
 would be 1930 -- ™39, early 1939. 
Q2: And who is this couple? 
A: This is my -- this -- th
ese are my first foster parent
s, L-Lena Cohen and th e -- her 
husband, whose name I can™t remember. I do re
me mb er that he was very dear and very 
quiet and didn™t ec -- expect anything of me exce
pt for me to sit next to him while we -- 

and look into the fire, whereas
 Auntie Lena insisted that 
I call her Auntie Lena and I 
could never get my self to do it. This pict
ure was given me by their youngest daughter 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0522  
194 
 
 
Ruth, who was my friend and 
champion and with whom I am
 still in touch. And who 
speaks very lovingly  of -- of these two parents. 
Q2: And this shot, Lore? 
A: It™s a picture of my  father, my  mo ther 
and me, age about 14. I think what -- what is
