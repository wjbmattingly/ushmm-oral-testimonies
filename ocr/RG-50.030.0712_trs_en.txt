was part of Romania, but it had been part 
of th e Au stro-Hungarian Empire until 1918.  
And thereafter, ________ it became attached to
 other nations, so it didn't stay Romania

where he had resided all his 
years in the United States. 
Q:And when and where we
re your parents born? 

Interview with Pepi Schafler

A:My parents were born -- my mother was 
born in a small town  called Berehomet, which 
was on th e border of the Bukovina and Po la
nd in -- when -- when 
th e Bukovina became 
part of Romania, Berehomet became part
 of Romania as well.  And her -- my 

grandparents lived there. Their -- my moth
er's maiden name was H o llar, Klara Hollar-
Schafler.  My grandparents' name was Malk
a -- grandmother's name was Malka Hollar.  
My grandfather's name was Ma
lkilabe(ph) Hollar. And my moth
er also had other siblings 
in the family.  She had two sist
ers that survived th
e Ho locaust, but her brother did not.  
He was deported from Berehomet with his fam
ily to -- to Moldova, to Transn istria, and 
they -- well, they -- they were e
ither beaten to death or died of
 starvation.  He didn't.  He 
was very ill, and he died in
 1945 in our house, but he wa
s very ill. My mother had 
another brother who was a banker in Indian a 
and during Kristallnacht, he -- he was -- the 
police came to pick him up, told him that he
 needed to  open the bank fo r some urgent 
matter, and he was never seen again.  His na
me was Benja -- Bena Hollar in Vienna.  So 
they -- in the morning,
 they let her know th at he ha
d a sudden appendicitis attack and 
died. So  his wife and son left Au stria and we
nt to the United States.  His son became a 
professor at the University of Connecticut at
 the Connecticut Institute for Research.  And 
I don't know, the lady, his widow, died. My  
father was born in a town called Vishnitz.  
He comes from a long line of people that lived 
in Vishnitz, and Vishnitz is also part of 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  And a long lin
e of people empowered.  Somebody had -- 

with an interest had tracked th
e Schafler family in Vishnitz
 and tracked it down to 19 -- 
to 1845 where the -- the town, it probably th
e equivalent of mayor or executive, was a

Schafler.  And the Schafler fam
ily was a ______   educated fa
mily  in Vishnitz.  That's all 
I know. My father's parents I did not know. 
 They died during the 
1918 group epidemic.  
My father was, at the time, a 
student at the University of Konstanz in Germany.  So he 
didn't  know too mu ch ab out them, about their de
ath. And then he -- and th en he -- at the 

time, he ma y have also ready been -- he 
was eventually a pris
oner in Moscow, the 
German army -- he was in the German army
 and he was taken prisoner.  So he didn't 
know much about the circumstan
ces of their death.  But that
's all I k n ow about my -- he 
had -- he had siblings.  He had two sisters an
d -- and a brother.  And there's more about -- 
it was an interesting experience. On e of hi
s sisters when -- when the Bukovina was 
annexed to  Soviet Union, one 
of his sister s was marrie d  to 
a very  wealthy man.  And he 
was with her when th ey had two children, and 
they had a baby.  They were -- as soon as 
the Soviet -- the Soviets occupied Chernowitz
 and Bukovina, they were deported to -- to 
Siberia, to Siberia. So they -- they went w
ith the older children who 
were then teens, and 
they left the baby behind to  their sister.  Th
ey figured they 're comin g  back and they'll get 
him.  Well, they -- they didn't 
co me back.  They came like 40
 years later.  They went to 
Israel, and the son was raised by the sister a
nd didn't know his parents and did not relate 
to them, and that was the end of th at. An
d the others -- I don't know -- you know, they 
died of natural causes in vari
ous places, mostl y  in
 the United States.  They all came to 
United States.  They were not interred in an
y concen tration camp; as were my  mo ther's 
sisters, they were not interred either. 

Q:And can you tell me what was your family
 life like?  What was 
your childhood like? 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
6 
A:Well, my  family life was a middle class, uppe
r middle class family life.  We lived in -- 
in those days, everybody lived  in
 apartment.  I guess they owne
d it or they didn't own it, I 
don't really know th at.  But we had a lovely  
apartment.  We always
 had household help, a 
maid.  When I was younger, we had a nurse maid
, sort of a nanny.  We -- I was -- it was a 
very nice apartment.  We had a nice life. 
My dad was the -- was a CPA.  He was an 
accountant and financial manager for Auto Ma
taro(ph), which was th
e Ford distribution 
center in Bukovina, and it was a
ll _______ and elegan
t, sort of Austrian style. And my 

mo ther, as I mentioned, we always had a ma
id, and it was comm on in  -- in those days in 
Europe to -- to go on the prom
enade around noon, 
betw een noon and one o'clock.  There 
were certain main avenues, you went on the 
prom -- it was true even in Paris and other 
places. My mother and her sist
ers dolled up every day and we
nt to the promenade.  And 
my  dad came home for the midday meal at one
 o'clock and we ate, and then  he took a 
nap, and went back to the o
ffice around four.  And that's
 what I remember a lot. I 
reme mb er my  mo th er 's sist ers, es p ecially  
the youngest one, was very beau tiful, tall, 
blonde, and she was sort of assert i v e and, 
you know -- I suppose we're not supposed to 
appear assertive, and they -- 
she was teased that she walked
 like a sergeant, you know.  
She -- on the promenade, she was sort of a
ssert ive.  That was a 
daily event. And my 
parents entertained.  My parents went out to
 -- for evening functions.  One -- I remember 
one night there was -- obviously th e maid was 
living in.  My -- my parents were out, and 
my  brother woke up and they weren't there, so
 he went and woke me up and said "They're 
not home."  "Okay."  "Come, le
t's -- let's look."  
And we went out on the terrace and we 
were looking for them. Well, my parents 
were coming home, and they could see the 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
7 
children on the terrace at one o'clo ck in the mo
rning.  They didn't 
know what to make of 
it.  You know, they  asked me -- well, they as
ked him, and I don't kno
w what he said, but 
they asked me and I said, "I don't know, he told
 me to get up."  You know, that's about it.  
He was two years older and told  me and I did.
  The maid didn't  know about this, and my 
parents were upset.  So I -- I reme mb er a very
 nice middle class, upper middle class life.  
We had -- we had a car at the disposal of 
the chauffeur.  I don't think my  dad drove.  
Certainly my  mo ther didn't . And my  mo ther sp
ent time with her family
 -- with her sisters, 
spent time homemaking.  You know, she baked 
and cooked and stuff 
like that.  Holiday 
dinners, I remember P assover Seders.  Dinner
 parties, when  I woke up and -- and heard 
voices and got up to  -- to go into th e dining
 room or living room and asked what time it 
was, which, you know, shocked my  parents. 
There was tea in the afternoon.  Neighbors 
invited me for tea.  And there were two ladies
, or my mother described them as spinsters, 
and they  wanted to pump  me about secret 
-- you know, family secr
ets.  Not so mu ch 
family secrets.  I don 't know 
what they were.  But like my 
mother 's t w o sisters, and the 
one wasn't  married and the othe
r one was just engaged, who we
re they seeing, you know.  
They  were pumping me, basically, but I lik
ed it, you know, and I talked.  You know, 
three years old, anything.  Four years old, 
anything. So  I reme mb er a very -- my  brother 
had started school before the Soviet occupati
on.  He went to public school, which took -- 
because a lot of the Jewish children went to
 Jewish schools.  But my parents -- my dad 
used his influence and wanted him to go to  
public school. He was -- he's very smart, he 
was very smart, but he -- he was sort of a 
troublemaker.  He did something, throw it in 
the garbag e, put it on th e door, wh ich almo st 
got him expelled.  My 
dad had to go and use 

Interview with Pepi Schafler

his influence.  I did not star
t school until the Soviet occupati
on other than -- than dancing 
school.  And I had neig hbors th
at I played with and friends.  And it was -- I had a lot of 
toys and stuff like that. In fact, ours was a 
kosher home, and my  pare
nts were concerned -
- I had been ill when I was three.  I had wh
ooping cough and -- and sc
arlet fever, so there 
were a series of some kidney
 problems.  So my parents we
re concerned that I wasn't 
gaining weight.  And, 
you know, Jewish mo ther always wo
rries about the kid not eating.  
So they  felt that maybe ham would -- would pu
t weight on me.  But, of course, they 
couldn't bring it into  the house. So the maid
 every afternoon for the -- what is called 
yowzah, for the -- the tea time, would take me
 to a -- a place that sold ham sandwiches 
where I could eat a ham on hard rolls.  I ate pa
rt of it anyway.  That was a daily ritual, I 
remember that. And I had -- and my closest frie
nd, play friend, was -- well, actually I met 
a little girl in the park whose father was -- tw
o I had -- her I was just fascinated.  But my 
closest girlfriend, the -- this girl I met in th
e park, little girl in the 
park, her father was a 
bus driver.  And they  lived in a basement one
 room, and she invited me to come  over.  So  
the maid took me there.  But wh en the ma
id told -- yeah , I didn't know one ro om from 
three, but I liked being in one room because 
everybody was in the sa
me place.  So the -- 
my -- my parents, my mother, was not too exc
ited about that, about this relatio nship after 
the maid told her that they 
live in a basement. But I -- I di
d still insist on going.  And 
since she didn't have too many toys, my  uncle
 had come -- Uncle Jupiter had come back 
from the toy fair in Leipzig.  Every year, they
 have this big toy fair.  And he brought me 
some toys which I already -- some of them 
I already had like a new 
baby doll buggy, so I 
gave them to her.  An d my  parents may not have
 liked it, but I don't k
now what they said.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler

I don't recall.  But my  brother, my  brother ha
d something to say about that, and he said, 
"You are gonna make us poor."  Because I ga
ve my toys away, these toys that Uncle 
Jupiter brought me. And the other friend that 
I spent a lot of time with was a little girl 
named An ita.  She was -- Anita Gelburd.  She was three years older than I was, and she 
had four -- I mean three older sisters.  Th
ere were four girls.  The oldest one was 
eighteen, nineteen, and there were a couple in 
between, and sh e was seven and I was five.  
She was -- since when I was f
our, and she was going to scho
ol.  And I loved being th ere 
because there was girl talk, 
you know.  There was a lot of
 commotion.  Our house was 
quiet, you know, kind of stuff.  And there 
it was commotion.  And unfortunately, the 
whole -- they were deported, all the Gelbur
ds -- the older daughter had gotten married 
somewhere in between and had 
a child, but the rest of th
e family was deported. And 
when  -- when people were coming back  wh en
 -- when  the nightmare ended, and th e 
oldest sister, whose name I think was Lenny,
 saw that her family didn't come b ack, she 
committed suicide.  Whole fam
ily went out {Crying}. That 
was my childhood.  Sort of 
uneventfu l.  You know, it just -- used to go 
see my grandparents.  
My grandparents were 
religious.  Shabbat -- Shabbat was Shabbat.  
You had Friday night dinner.  I liked my  
grandparents. My grandfather was something in
 a wood factory.  I don't know what he 
did.  He was a supervisor or something.  
And on Shabbat, people 
would come over and -- 
and, you know, they 'd  -- my  grandmother woul
d bake stuff on Friday, make challah, and 
she gave me a piece of dough 
and I could work -- work the 
system.  And they were -- 
they were kind people that I -- I loved.  And 
didn't see th at much of them.  And I -- they 

were a different way of life than -- than we 
were used to, but it was a nice life. The whole 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
10 
town -- you know, there was a ma
in street, and their house was on the main street.  They 
were all individual houses.  And she -- peop
le would walk by and see you on the porch 
and that kind of stuff.  It was different
.  They had a garden
 in the back.  And 
unfortunately, they were killed 
in Moghilev.  They -- they di
ed.  They weren't killed.  
They  died  of malnutrition probably, and th ey 
were older so didn't  see too mu ch of them 
after that.  You know, after the war started, 
we didn't see too mu ch  of them. So that's 
basically -- I didn 't start 
-- when the Soviets occupied th e Bukovina, when  it was 
annexed, wasn't occupied, they would like 
to say it was annexed, in  1940, I started 
school, in Russian school. No w,
 I -- to roll back, wh
en  my  dad used to
 come home for -- 
for his -- the midday meal, then he would lie 
-- lie down, I guess it was a couch.  I know 
he was -- he lied down and I lied down  right 
alongside of him.  Had my  head on the -- 
sort of under his arm.  I learned to read.  
I learned to read.  We spoke German at home, 
but I had learned to read  Ro manian and to speak Romanian, and I also later learned some 
Russian, even before -- before school.  Bu
t Ro manian and German I had learned. And 
when I didn't learn fro m -- when I was read
ing the paper with my  dad would -- what I 
didn't  learn , I sort of translated myself, yo
u know, like -- I remember
 an example that my 
family had repeated, namely that in Germ
an whipped cream is schlagsahne, meaning 
beating, and sahne -- or schlagobers, the Au
strians used to say.  Well, schlag means 
beating and -- and obers is a colonel.  Th
at's the -- so I had 
translate d  __________ 
batoot(ph), you know, beaten colonel fo
r -- for whipped cream.  That was my 
accomplishment.  And people t
eased -- my parents teased , my brother especially  teased 
me about that. It was a quiet life, pleasant. 
 You know, no -- no par
ticular drama until just 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
11 
before the Soviet occupation.  I remember my
 parents, we -- my mother and the children 
had been visiting the grandparents, and my  
father came for the weekend and was -- was 
telling my  parent -- my  mo ther and th e grandpa
rents that the maid s -- they were usually 
Ukrainian or Lithuanian, and th ey
 -- that there -- there is unrest,
 that there is h ooliganism.  
But I mean it was abstract.  It 
wasn't -- nothing had happened 
to us or to our house kind 
of thing.  Bu t there was some cloud on th
e horizon. And in 19
40, the -- the Soviet 
marched in.  It wasn 't  -- it wasn 't  like Army 
takeover.  It was -- they just sort of marched 
in.  It was by agreement, although they had 
bombed, apparently, the 
airport.  So it was 
sort of different but much the same. The -- the 
Soviet -- the Auto Mato
ro was eviscerated.  
And my  dad, they wanted 
-- some  town  father or whatever these people had as 
commanders wanted my  dad to be the accounta
nt for Meloche (ph) Trust.  In -- in the 
Soviet Union, in co mmunistic structures, everythi
ng is a trust.  It's 
the milk trust and the -
- the shoe trust and the -- so Meloche Trust 
was the dairy trust, and my  dad became the 
accountant and chief financial officer for the 
dairy trust. And, you know, we basically 
went on the same.  I started school.  I don't 
rememb er whether it was kinderg arten or first 
grade.  I mean I don't know that I would have
 been able to tell th
e difference actually.  
But it was Russian and -- My parents ente
rtained some -- I remember my parents 
entertained some -- somebody from the comp
any, some people from the comp any, 
Russians, and th e guys were 
amazed how people lived, you 
know, the beauty
, what they 
considered luxury.  I mean we were uppe
r mi ddle class people, but we weren't by no 
means rich.  Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever. And he -- he was just 

amazed at how people lived.  A
nd he said something to my 
parents, and my brother felt 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
12 
compelled to answer, so he said
, "Yeah, this is all nice, b u t they call us dirty Jews."  So 
he said, "Well, you can call me 
anything you want as long as
 you feed me honey."  So  
that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a 
perception of what they  had, you know.  But 
other than that, the year went uneventful ag
ain, and you went to 
school and you -- my  
Uncle Jupiter was not too {C oughs} excited ab
out it because he was a businessman.  He -
- he did international busin ess with -- with
 Au stria and Germany 
and France, and he 
couldn't do that.  So he was not too excited bu
t, you know, he had to put up and shut up, 
basically. And when the Naz -- on
 July 21, 1941
, the war started.  I 
mean Nazis invaded.  
Actually, rolling back, in '39 
I remember when Poland was i
nvaded.  How do I reme mb er 
it is that my mother had take
n me for someplace, to some
 -- somewhere, and we were 
coming back.  And in front of the perfect _
______, the police there,
 which was the major 
police entity, there were people sitting on -- on 
packages on the street and the sidewalk.  
And I had asked "Why are they there", and my
 mother told me th
at -- this was in 
September 1939 -- that these people are fro
m Poland and they are refugees. And -- and 

just as we were standing there, a dog came 
by and bit my thigh, you know, chubby little 
thighs of little girls, an d that was a big minor 
crisis.  You know, I don't think he broke the 
skin, I don't remember, just th
at the idea of it was a majo r thing. So in 1941 -- and we 
knew that Hitler had inva
ded Poland and that there was -- a
nd in 1941, the Nazis, on June 
21st, 1941, the Nazis occupied Chernowitz a
nd then ev erything ch anged.  That was not 
benign, that was not -- it was -- first of all, 
it was war, number one, although you didn't 
feel it that much. But there we
re -- there were a lot of anti-Semitic outbursts.  A lot of 
windows broke and a lo t of Jewish businesse
s broken and -- I don't -- and lot of Jewish 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
13 
businesses just simply put out
 of business. And -- and th e 
Nazis had plans, had made 
plans to basically make  Cher
owitz _________, to expel all 
the Jews.  Alth
ough my Uncle 
Jupiter was not -- he said, "Oh, they 're not go
nna do it."  And he was 
-- he was amenable.  
He was pleased that -- that the Soviets had 
gone.  Oh, let me roll 
back. In 1939, when 
Europe was getting just by things not look
ing so  well, the Ford
 Mo tor Comp any in  
Michigan  had -- had offered my  father and hi
s family to come to America.  And my 
mother said, "Who goes to Am erica?  Only people that wa
nt to get away from a bad 
wife."  Because in Europe, divorce was very
 difficult.  Or people that can 't make it 
financially and stuff like that.  So that wa
s one opportunity missed. And -- and wh en th e 
Soviets were retreating, they offered my dad 
to come to Moscow.  And my parents were 
sort of torn, I guess, about that.  Bu t Un cle 
Jupiter said, "No way, 
don't -- don't you dare", 
you know, kind of stuff.  So that was the othe
r opportunity that -- that was missed. And in 
1941 -- so when they 
occupied, Jewish children could not 
go to school.  And they -- they 
started forming a ghetto.  All -- all Jews had to
 move into a certain area where Jews -- let 
me roll back. Uncle Jupiter immediately went
 into business or -- or revived an  old 
business, I'm really not sure. 
 But food transport, eggs, stuff like that was a big busin ess 
in Europe.  I -- I didn't really know that 
until much later.  And he was involved with 
shipping aid -- you know, transporting food, 
eggs, dairy, who knows.  That business was 
not in Chernowitz.  It was, what, 40, 50 mile
s away in some smal l 
town . So  he was back 
in -- he was in busin ess immediately.  And 
so  w h en  th ey  
-- when they tried to make 
Chernowitz _______, they orde
red people to move into ghetto
s, you know, certain streets 
where Jews had lived and where the kosher sh
ops were and stuff.  But 5,000 people or 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
14 
whatever thousand, I don't know, maybe -- ma
ybe more, maybe 6,000 were permitted to 
stay in their homes because th
ey were needed to 
run the town.  I me
an they were the 
professors and the physicians and the busin e
ssmen.  And we were pe
rmitted to stay in 
town, and Uncle Jupiter was pe
rmitted to stay in town, and 
so were -- so was my uncle, 
my  father's brother. And so we were home but 
-- and then  these people that had gone to 
the ghetto -- so, there is -- apparently there wa
s a list that they pu
t people on, and these 
people could stay in their hom
es.  And those that had been  
put in the ghetto, some were 
transported to Transn istria, and some were
 allowed to go home an
d they would have 
transports later on.  Well, we never went so, 
you know, we were cons
idered not at risk.  
And this was like in September or in the fall. 
And the next -- so after the winter, the next 
deportation -- these were deporta
tions, by the way, they were. 
 The next deportations -- I 
didn't  go to school.  My  brother didn't go to sc
hool.  I had a non-Jewish friend that I met 
in dancing school, and then in
 the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk.  Her father was a 
prominen t attorney.  And then  in that one ye
ar of schooling that was either kindergarten 
or first grade, I don't know wh ich one, and th
ey -- they used to come over and bring me 
school work .  And so to  keep  me in touch w
ith school work, and -- and bring stuff for my 
brother.  So then in the -- the 
next deportations were ordere
d to take place in June of 
1942, and they were to be 
-- to take place on three consecutive Su ndays. Oh, my  dad -- 
my  dad had a job, so Un cle -- he work ed 
in  Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food 
transport, had something to do with eggs an
d stuff.  And my dad wo
uld travel with Uncle 
Jupiter every weekend.  He would come hom
e every weekend.  He would travel every 
Monday, go there.  So Jews had to be home 
on those three consecutive Sundays, and that 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
15 
didn't  affect us the first two Sundays.  Th
e third Sunday -- and I 
had, in fact, said 
goodbye to some neighbor gi
rl that I knew, whose name I don't even remember, b u t I 
know I had said goodbye to 
somebody. Bu t the third Sunday, Un cle Jupiter had sent a 
chauffeur.  So Jews couldn't  be out, but he
 -- he could send a chau ffeur.  And my  dad had 
come back on Friday .  He had -- he went to
 the bank or he pick
ed up money, had a 
briefcase full of money, real money, two hu
ndred -- the equivalent of $250,0 00 to pay 
wages, to buy material, who knows why.  That 's
 what he had.  The briefcase was lying in 
our hallway, like the entrance hall had lik
e a cabinet. And Uncle Jupiter sent the 
chauffeur Su nday  evening about eight o'clock or
 so to suggest that we come to his house, 
that we stay with -- with th
em.  And my mother said, "Nah
, I don't want to go."  You 
know, Max is going to 
-- back to -- I can 't remember th
e town where this business was, 
and he has this money and, 
you know, Un cle Jupiter was goi
ng with him so he knew.  
And, you know, "Bathe the child
ren, put them to bed.  I do
n't think so." Well, that was 
our last chance, because in the middle of 
the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell 
rang and it was the police, and they said they 
wanted us to go to 
the police station to 
check the documents.  Don't 
worry about it, nothing serious
, just check the documents. 
So we dressed.  My -- I dressed myself.  I 
re memb er we arin g  kn eeso
cks.  That's what 
every kid wore, kneesocks, little k n eesocks.
  And we -- when we got out of our 
apartment, there were -- there was a lot of pol
ice and a lot of people in the building that 
were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I 
didn't  have the perception to  understand it, 
that somebody was giving some policeman a 
bag of jewelry and they didn't  go, they 
didn't  leave. So -- but, you know, my  parent
s were secure that -- that once he -- they 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
16 
know that he's needed
, then the business will open, it wo
n't have any mone
y, that nothing 
would happen to us.  Well, that
 was obviously wrong. We -- we left the house in a -- like 
a bus, and we were taken to -- to cattle cars, a
nd that was it.  And my dad, we didn't have 
any -- we didn't pack any lu ggag e, although 
some people had taken something.  My dad 
had the briefcase of mo ney, and 
that's it. And we learned late
r that th e -- that they were 
short on the transport.  They  had to have 2,
000 people in the three -- three transports, and 
they were short 120 people on this transport. 
 So they just went in
to a place where they 
knew Jews lived and took th em, you know.  I 
mean who's gonna hold them accountable? 
So that was basically how we were on the ca
ttle car on the way to Transnistria.  That 
ended the ch ildhood that I experienced. 
Q:Did you have any sense of 
what transports meant before 
that mo me nt?  Had you heard 
about transports, or was this the fi
rst -- your first experience with it? 

A:I mean I knew what a transport was as a forc
eable sort of thing, but I -- I didn't really.  
Neither did my  brother.  We didn't  really. 
 And we sort of relied on -- on something, I'm 
not sure what that something was.  I cannot
 articulate now.  But we relied on status or 

something th at -- that it's  gonna
 turn out okay.  And 
in fact, the train that -- that we were 
on, the cattle car, it sto pped in -- outsid
e of Moghilev someplace, and people were 
looking for water.  Obviously we
 had no food. Oh, the night be
fore when my mother said, 
"Oh, we'l l stay home, bathe the kids, put them 
to bed", we were havi
ng dinner.  Not that -
- the big meal was usually at noon, but some dinner.  And my  brother who always 

complained said, "Nah, I don 't lik
e this.  It's too greasy."  I 
don't know wh at it was, I can't 
reme mb er. And my  mo ther said, "Some day yo
u're gonna be hungry
 and you won't have

anything to eat."  Just to, 
you know, to -- he was getting a 
little on her nerves, I suppose.  
It was a constant thing.  He wouldn't eat,
 and complain, and sh e would worry.  It was a 
merry-go-ro und.  And there he was, two days 
later he was hungry, you know.  There was 
nothing to eat. So it was like {Coughs} was he
 clairvoyant, was it a feeling that -- who 
knows.  She never -- we never discussed it ag
ain because -- at the sa
me ti me, i f  sh e h ad  
any feelings, she should've -- we should'v e go
ne to my  uncle's house. So we were on the 
train.  And when  the train stopped -- well, 
my  uncle, the concierg
e where we lived, my 
parents told them to go to Jupiter's, 
which was I don't know how many -- the distance 
was, and tell him that we were taken.  And 
he did do that.  So 
my uncle put in -- in 
mo tion all kinds of -- called all kinds of people 
by nine o'clock to get us off the train, but 
you couldn't, I mean -- and to 
get us out and stuff like that. 
 So when -- wh
en the train 
stopped, I went to get some water, and I saw 
people, and I don't -- I had a container, but I 
don't remember where I got it and what it was 
like. And it was down a hill, and I slipped 
and I inju red my  knee.  It might have been something glass that I held, but it was a big 
cut on my knee, and there was no
thing to  -- to deal with it, nothing to clean, nothing to 
clean with, so that became in
fected .  And for the next th
ree months or more, July, 
August, September, three months, I couldn't  be
nd the knee.  It was -- it was sw ollen and 
hot, and I couldn't bend it. So -- but I'll tell you 
once we got to camp , if you wanted to ask 
me about getting there, so this is how we 
wound up in  Transnistria.  And the camp we 
were taken was Cariera de Piatra
, which is a stone quarry, tran
slated stone quarry.  It was 
-- it had a Romanian commander.  And we were
 unloaded, and there were barracks from I 
guess the people that work
ed there at the sto n e quarry, so
 we were put into barracks. I

out the barrack other than that th ere were a lot of people in each 
barrack and that we slept on like pallets, wood
en pallets, but they we
re -- they were off 
the floor, but they were 
-- they were contiguous, you know. 
 It was like -- so that's what I 
remember. And every day I was sitting outside. 
 I don't know whether 
they carried me.  I 
was sitting on a big rock with my leg, my 
swollen leg, and it was getting bigger and I 
couldn't bend it.  And I had little
 pig -- pigtails and sat ther
e and at some point -- if you 
want me to continue.  Did yo
u want to ask me something el
se?  I mean I'll continue. 
Q:Were you togeth er with 
your family at that point? 

A:Yes.  Yes. 
Q:And how long was the journey from Chernowitz to -- to camp ? 
A:It probably was about four da
ys, five days.  And if you want me to continue, I'll tell 
you about being there.  So the camp  wa
s commanded by a Romanian officer, and he 
would walk around ev ery day, 
and -- and the barracks were like in a circle around the 
piazza, if you will, or the -- I can 't  think of an
other word at the mome
nt -- that round sort 
of in the middle of it for -- So he would just sort of walk around every day.  He would 
come by.  And he would see me
 and he wo uld go by and pull 
my pigtails and look at the 
knee and, you know, smile or pat my  head 
or something and -- and walk on. At some 
point, I don't know whether -- how my  parents he
ard, but my  -- my  father figured he has 
to return the money to the 
comp any.  So he gave the -- the camp  commander, about 
maybe a month later, month and a half, the br
iefcase full of money.  And the commander 
returned it to the company.  He
 did not pocket it.  And the 
-- my uncles -- so with the -- I 
mean the authorities that could do that were im
pressed that my father 
returned the money.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
19 
It never occu rred to him to buy his way ou
t with that.  And -- and that the camp 
commander forwarded it on.  So he -- but so
mehow th e camp  commander had been told  
that there are efforts underw ay -- can I get you 
mo re comfortable -- that there are efforts 
underway  to bring us back. So  wh at we 
-- you know, we were 
hungry.  People were 
dying.  My  parents did their best to -- the pe
ople -- my parents -- my father had to work 
on th e quarries, I guess.  I don't rememb er much 
of that.  Some local farmers came with -- 
selling food.  If you had money, you could buy.
  I don't know.  You 
had to sell stuff to 
them.  But I mean food was scarce. I can 't say that I ever complained
 or that my  brother 
ever complained because we kn
ew that our parents -- someho
w that childhood that your 
parents are always on top of you doing the be
st for you, you know.  There's so many little 
things that they demons
trated that.  So that if there wa
s no food, it's because there was no 
food kind of thing. Well, in September, ar
ound September or early October -- I mean we 
didn't  have a calendar, didn't  know one day fr
om another.  My parents might have known 
when it was.  The -- there was 
an edict to exterminate th e Jews from Cariera d e Piatra, 
basically.  But the -- the people to be sent 
away were to be told that they 're being 

relocated.  So -- 
Q:And how did you -- how did you know that?  
Is this something you 
learned later or is 
this something that you 
heard from your parents? 
A:Something I learned later, right.  At the 
time, people didn't know.  Something we 
learned later.  And so one day, there are all th
ese Nazi people.  There's a setup of tables.  
People are told to line up, get their possessions  and get in line.  And my family, we were 
in -- sort of getting ready to
 go in line, and the camp  commander mu st have signaled -- 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
20 
signaled to my parents for -- there were tabl
es over there and he was standing over here 
to -- to the right of the Nazis.  They were sort of registering people. And he -- he -- my 
mother went up to him and said, you know,
 "Where -- how will this -- how will this 
affect our returning home?"  A
nd he looked  at her and he sa
id, "Run.  Run over there."  
Now, he was standing this way, he was sta
nding this way (indicating).  And the Nazis, 
they were loading on truck.  He 
said, "Run to the right.  Right." 
Q:He told you to run behind him? 
A:Yeah, "Run over there."  So my parents ran,
 my  brother, and my  knee that I couldn't  
have -- I ran, and it was oozing.  I ran.  And 
-- and he said, "Run and 
hide." So -- so when 
-- once we came -- we ran, there were on that
 part of the -- of the circle, there were 
shacks that must have been eq
uipment shacks or something.  
So we -- we entered a shack 
and there were other people that -- that he ha
d told to hide.  {Cry
ing} -- this is very 
emotional, so forgive me, but I 
think that's -- that's  the pivot
al thing that happened.  So 
we went to stay in there, 
and it turned dark, and water, fo
od, nothing. One -- before it 
turned dark, the Nazis went 
on an ex -- inspection tour 
with the camp commander, and 
they said, "What's in there?"  He said, "Oh, 
nothing.  Old equipment that we don't use and 
we throw away."  And 
they said, "Oh, okay."  And they
 walked away, and th en  we could 
hear the trucks left. The next morning, th
e camp commander asked ev
erybody to come to 
the square, ordered ev erybody to  come to the 
square.  {Crying} and he said, "I saved as 
many of you as I could."  There had been
 4,000 people in the camp {Coughs} and now 
there were about 300.  And he said {Cryin
g}, "Did my best.  You will have a tough 
winter.  But if you surv ive th
e winter, you'll be okay." 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
21 
Q:So this was in the 
fall that this happened? 
A:Yeah, in the fall.  We -- and he sent peop
le back to the barracks.  I d on't -- but, you 
know, here is a guy, here is -- that the Nazi
s put in there because they  -- they saw in him 
something that they thought woul
d be to their advantage, and 
it turned out it wasn't. So he 
-- he did the best -- he says, "I'll do the best
 I can to help you." 
 There was some  food 
provided , and I don't recall how.  My brother 
got typhoid, got typhus, and th en he got 
some infection. Do  you mind if I get a 
tissue and somewate
r?  Would you like 
something? 
Q:No, okay.  One minute.  [In
terview paused].  Go ahead. 
A:Okay .  Are we okay? 

Q: Uh-h uh. 

A:So my  brother had ty phoid, 
and he had an in fection in his 
leg.  And he was -- for about 
three weeks, he was unconscious.  And then 
I got typhoid.  And I remember nothing till 
the spring.  I was very sick. 
My -- my  parents had nothing to sell.  There was a docto r, 
but he was Jewish.  I don't know where he got 
-- they gave people strych -- he gave, to 
live, I guess, to -- to stimulate 
the heart, they were giving st
rychnine shots.  Why th at, I 
don't know.  And wh ere he got them, I don't kno
w.  Bu t my  mo ther gave some of the 

wedding -- her wedding ring, and 
they got the strychnine.  And 
then we both recovered.  I 
had some other illnesses.  They cut my hair 
off, you know, my pigta
ils off.  T h ey were 
full of lice anyway.  And then 
I lost my hair, and then it st
arted growing back .  And then  
the spring came. And in the spring, we were 
transported to -- 120 pe
ople were transported 
to the other -- this other cam
p Capostiano(ph), which is a v
illage, and the people were 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
22 
housed in , I don't know, houses or shacks that
 -- and they worked, I 
guess, the fields. My 
-- my  family and two other families were
 housed -- it was -- one of the things in 
Capostiano was that it was a sof-house(ph).  
Sof-house, a co-house, is a communal kind 
of enterprise.  Everybody has a 
share in the total.  And in so
f-house is that you keep your 
own property but you -- you -- what you har -- 
harvest is communal.  So in other word s, 
if one grows potatoes and one grows carrots, yo
u -- that's communal. So we were placed -
- three families.  There was the Glotters, wh
ich was a husband -- he was a soccer player 
and he was sort of caught in 
Chernowitz in a riot, with hi
s wife.  And he had a baby, a 
young baby when  he was deported.  The -- Ha
rry.  By the time we got together, he -- 
Harry was two years old.  And they were th
e Glotters.  And then there was a retired 
couple.  He was -- had been the Postmaster G e
neral for Chernowitz, and he was this very 
distinguished sort of looking man, older man,
 and his wife. And my family -- and we -- 
we received a room on the property of the so f-house, and again it was sort of like a circle 
for various functions.  And we -- we were hous
ed in two small rooms.  When you walk ed 
in, there were -- just you could stand or sit or
 stretch out, lay down , I suppose. And across 
was the dairy -- the milk separa
tors.  They brought 
all the milk in ther
e and the machines 
were sep -- making cheese and butter and stuff 
like that.  So that wa
s on the other side.  
So we had th e -- several advant
ag es of being in there.  One is that we had -- I don't 
remember whether -- which room we had, but 
we had some -- we us
ed to get some little 
skim milk or somethi
ng from the separators.  And my  da
d was immediately recruited to -- 
to do the bookkeepin
g for the farm.  I mean 
that's -- that's -- so he
 went to work every 
day. My  mo ther did not wo rk, was not demanded to wo rk.  Sh e was going around 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
23 
offering -- my mother had been 
a -- years before she married,
 she -- she and her sister s, 
they had a small  sea m stress 
designing salon.  They  did 
ball gowns and debutant gowns 
and things like that.  And so  she went around 
offering her services to
 the farm women, or 
to the men telling your wife, and we got some pot
atoes.  We got to eat -- I love -- I got to 
love potatoes and even potato skins.  I mean
 the -- we had -- we were no longer starving 
as much as we had in the pa
st. So on th e farm, there were two pivotal people that would -
- it's like a movie, Matt -- Matt D amon.  He 
-- there was this guy named Misha.  He was a 
young guy, about 25.  He appear
ed to be 25 to me.  Very g
ood looking.  And I was at the 
time -- when we got to Kazakhstan, I was se
ven years old, and -- but I knew he was good 
looking, with a mu stache, blonde.  And he
 was the commander -- 
you know, he was in 
charge of th e sof-house, and he would go arou
nd and scream at people. But the Jewish -- 
oh, the other Jewish people, the others that we
re teens, were in th
e town.  They worked 
somewhere in the town on
 farms.  On the sof-house, there were no other deportees.  Just 
these three families.  S o  we had no contact w
ith them.  Not that we
 knew them, we didn't, 
but we also had no co ntact.  So I mean obviou
sly we couldn't  leave, or maybe we could, 
we never -- it never occurred to somebody to 
go stroll through town. 
So there was Misha, 
and then  there was the -- the -- he would co me
 by twice a day or something.  And, you 
know, demanding -- he was dema nding ag ainst the 
fam -- I mean we didn't have -- he had 
-- maybe he, Mr. Glotter, I think, worked for th
e farm.  I don't rememb
er that.  He -- he'd  
play with little Harry. And then the other person that would come 
by every day was an 
older man, sort of a heavy man.  He may not ha
ve been  as heavy, as he wore this big coat, 
and he wore it all the time, same thing, ever
y day.  He was short and walked  slow.  And 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
24 
he was -- they said he was a vet.  And he we
nt to check, every day he checked the milk 
and checked the -- the separa
tors. And, you know, would say hello, maybe a pat on the 
head, that's it.  Would not inte
ract.  Misha interacted more.  
So that's how we lived.  We -
- occasionally Misha would tell something abou
t the news that's going on in the world.  
We lost all hope of -- that we wo uld be brou
ght back.  We knew th at
 the -- so from Misha 
we knew that the Nazis were losing, that th
e army  was moving fo rward, the Soviet Army .  
So I -- my  brother work ed in th e gardens.  I 
don't recall what he did.  I know wh at I did.  
Maybe he did the same  thing.  I pulled w
eeds.  I was -- p u lled weeds from the plants. 

Somehow we heard -- this is ac
tually 1943.  I was eight years 
old.  My parents heard, and 
I'm not sure how, that the Red Cross -- oh, 
I know.  Let me roll back. The -- we started 
hearing -- if you envision like th is room is round and down  there is a forest, and we heard 

shooting at night in the forest.  And we didn 't
 know what it meant.  
D id they -- were they 
gonna shoot -- were they
 shooting Jews?  We didn't know.  We didn't know that the Nazis 
-- that this was the partisans 
were doing that stuff. So we -- 
we learned that the Red Cross 

was -- this is probably -- should I give you a 
napkin?  That the Red Cross was -- I think 
maybe from Misha, t h at the Red Cross was tryi
ng to  save the children.  And they were 
organizing a -- a mercy transport back, kinder 
transport back to Romania to save us from 
the -- because they feared that -- the gene
ral premise was that the Nazis would kill 
everybody in their path back, 
and they (?withdraw?) that 
they would kill the Jews and 
everybody else.  So they wa
nted to save the children. 
Q:And who ran the collective that you were 
in?  Was it run by th e Germans?  Was it run 
by th e Romanians? 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
25 
A: Pardon me? 
Q:Who ran the collective where y
ou were work ing in  Kazakhstan? 
A:Well, nobody ran it really.  It was -- it 
ran itself.  The -- th
e commander, the Misha, 
was, you know, he said he was a Ukrainian 
and -- and the people -- the people basically 
owned it. The -- there was no guard in control.
  And the -- the round guy was -- was just 
in charge of the farm.  So -- 
so it wasn't clear.  We were basically free, you know.  We 
could starve on our own, die 
on our own.  You know, we pr
obab ly could have left, but 
you are in the -- on the corner of nowhere an
d nowhere without any money and you are in 

rags. So the Nazis -- as the Nazis were movi ng -- I mean the -- as the Soviet Army was 
moving forward, the Nazis were in retreat.  
And we could hear a lot of gunfire, and we -- 
I can't reme mb er whether somebody to ld my  
dad that this was the partisans, you know, 
that were hiding in the forest
, and they -- they were shooting the -- they were destroying 
the train, the railroad tracks and things. Sowhen -- when the Red Cr
oss -- some body told 
my  dad at work  that the Red Cross wants to ta
ke the children out, ou
t of there, so they 
would su rvive.  {Coughs} the -- my parents si
gned us up.  Well, my parents talked to us 
first, and I didn't  want to go.  I felt that I 
wanted to stay with my parents. My brother was 
not as vocal as I was.  Now, at
 this I must make a point that 
this Jagendorf, this guy, says 
he arranged it.  And that is 
a lie.  That is not true.  Bu
t anyway, they -- it was the Red 
Cross.  He says with the -- he arrange it with
 the Red Cross.  The Red Cross.  There was a 
lot going on that we didn't know.  There wa
s a lot going on in  the Soviet Un ion that -- 
that we didn't know about.  They -- that th
ey knew about.  So they  signed us up, and -- 
and in order to ensure, A, that
 -- that we stayed together -- that we get -- we get to go.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
26 
And he says this was for -- only for orphans.  
Not true.  We weren't orphans. So -- but my 
parents wanted to assure that we would always 
stay together, so they 
made us twins.  So 
they pick ed the birthdate, 1931, on Novemb er 28t
h, 1931, so they couldn't  be traced back, 
and -- and signed us up. But then th ey were
 worried about -- also my parents were 
worried about that I was too yo
ung, somebody would -- so they 
-- they register us twice.  
If you -- hopefully I get the list, 
if not I'll chase the woman do
wn.  They -- they registered 
us twice; once as twins, and other times as bo
th separately being 11 and 12 years old.  
Just to -- to, you know, sort of secure that if somebody can 't take tw ins, they can take 
one.  Or if eight, they think will be too young to
 complain or somethi
ng like that.  So they 
registered us.  And you couldn
't -- you couldn't be sent b
ack to Chernowitz.  You could 
not.  Bu t you could be sent a
ny other place in Romania. Well,
 you know, wh ere to send in 
Romania, you know, cold, but my -- only wher
e we have friends and family.  We -- my 
dad had done -- he had done business with Fo rd
, with Auto Motora(
ph), the Ford agency 
in the city called Botosh an. 
He knew Mr. Bacall, who wa
s a man by then would have 
been in his 50s or 60s, and 
he figured -- and Mr. Bacall also
 had two -- two sons.  So he 

figured they -- they -- if they 'r
e th ere, they 'll take us.  An
d so he put them down to -- 
that's where we were going, 
to the Bacall's in Botosh an
. We left around -- before 
Christmas -- and then  when  my  parents a 
couple of times asked Misha, "What's the 
shooting up there?"  He says, "I don't hear any.
  Shooting?  I never heard any."  So, you 
know, we -- we just sort of didn't -- didn't pr
ess him. The -- but he would come in and say 
to us -- "Hold on, ________+ -- just
 -- just stay."  He -- he invited us -- so he said he was 
married to this farm w o man.  He invited us
 to his house once for 
dinner or twice.  And 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
27 
this woman was 20 years older than he was, 
wh ich that's  how it goes.  And had a nice -- 
you know, it was good.  Anythi
ng was nice.  And so, you know, he -- but he always said 
"Just -- just stay and hold on."  So  would th
e round man, the vet. And so  we -- we -- my 
parents said you gotta go.  So we went.  We 
left.  My dad rode with us to Moghilev in a 
cart with horse, horse and bug
gy.  And somebody else, whic
h I can't remember who the 
somebody else was.  Not a child
.  It was an adult. And we stayed in Mogh
ilev for -- for a 
couple of weeks while the transport was being or
ganized.  And I cried a lot.  I was sick.  I 
was heartbroken.  My dad return ed  in that 
horse and buggy.  And of course, my  parents 
were heartbroken.  But that -- that was the 
general -- you are heartbr
oken wh en you are in 
a concentration -- Nazi concentr
ation camp. We eventually made our way to  Bo tosh an in 
-- in the spring.  There were 
about 18 children that went to
 Botosh an from other camps.  
Jagendorf says that when -- when -- that he 
arrange it and the children of Bo to shan have a 
welcoming for them.  Never happ
ened. So we -- we arrived by train, by a regular train.  
And we were in like a large room, and the peopl
e that were supposed to pick up children 
came, but so did a lot of other people.  Y
ou know, just -- just to
 help, just to care 
{Crying}.  So the Bacalls were
n 't there.  It w as circumstantial, because they were not 
notified and they were out of to wn . Bu t ther
e were other people who said -- numerous 
other people who said, "We'll take care of th
em.  We will."  And 
there was some body in 
charge wh o decided who may an d who may not,
 I guess.  There was this family named 
Finklestein.  A woman, she was I think 29.  
Sh e had a brother that was 25.  They lived 
with their father.  And they
 said, "We want them.  We want them."  And they had 
neighbors, a couple, and -- and tw o sons, like 
18 and 20, and they sa
id, "We want them.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
28 
We want them.  All of us want
 them.  We'll take care of them
."  So we went. They were 
the most loving, wonderful people
.  I mean they were so ha
ppy to have us.  You know, 
we were dirty, we were probably in rags, a
nd I don't really rememb
er.  They -- they fed 
us.  They caressed us.  They -- th
ey were -- they put us to sleep
 in their beds.  I mean they 
were not people of means.  They had a small 
-- little bit small apartment, but -- and -- and 
we were so excited, that the -- the son sat 
up all night and the neig hbor, the Marcus, the 
name was Marcus, he sat up -- the two of them 
sat up all night to watch us sleep.  They  
were worried that if someth
ing happens in our sleep.  And just the sweetest, kindest 
people.  And was fine for us, we -- we were ha
ppy to stay there. They cleaned our shoes, 
such as they were.  I don't re
me mber what kind of shoes I ha
d and what clothes, but they 
-- they got us some clothes or they gave us 
theirs.  I don't reme mb er nothing about that.  I 
was just so taken by their kindness.  That 
was just -- i t was like 
-- like you're a dream, 
you know, you're dreaming about 
this. And we stayed there for 
four or five days, and th e 
Bacalls came back, and they fo
und out that -- that we had a
rrived and th ey were not there 
and they  were notified.  They were not to
o happy about it and, of course, they also 
powerful people and they're also ri
ch people, so they sent a ch
auffeur and -- to pick us up. 
And, you know, the Finklesteins and th e Marcuses, they were so upset.  And they -- they 

called somebody and they were
 trying to say -- and Mr. Bacall said -- you know, Mr. and 
Mrs. Bacall, these gorgeous-looking people, lik
e something you see in
 the movies.  And 
they said, "No, they -- 
they -- their parents said they co
me here.  They come here." Mr. 
Bacall, Sr. had died in the in
terim.  And they ha
d the Ford agency 
still.  And so, you 
know, mo ney trumps a lot of things.  We stay
ed in touch with the 
Finklesteins though and 

Interview with Pepi Schafler

the Marcuses. So they -- we st
ayed with the Bacalls
 for -- for several months.  They were 
very kind and very lo ving, and I guess they
 bought us clothes.  I don't know wh ere the 
clothes came from, b u t we -- they weren't th e rags that we came with. And it was a 
household where there was a maid and -- an
d a chauffeur and butler.  So dinner was 
formal and -- and, you know, 
you rang the bell if you wanted 
something, even  to make 
the butler come from a long ways
 so he open the bottle.  And 
that -- we stayed there -- of 
course, when the Soviet occupied, reoccupi
ed the Bukovina, the 
Bacalls lost their 
household help.  Apparently, the -- the maid
 and the butler had been communists.  I 
wonder why.  And so they -- 
they quit. But before -- befo
re this, the occupation, the 
reoccupation, was not -- was not seamless.  
The Soviets bombed the town  and bomb ed -- 
it was a sed er, I remember the seder, and there 
were people and it was an elegant sort of 

dinner.  And we stayed -- we went on the ba
lcony and looking over, and then  the alarm 
had gone off for the bomb  shelters, and ther
e was a bomb shelter. But before we could -- 
could process it, a bomb had hit the house ac
ross the street.  And 
by the time we got to 
the bomb shelter, the go-ro und, there were appare
ntly a lot of victims.  And my  brother 
insisted on going to  help care for the victims.
  The men went, you kn
ow, to help.  And I 
think he was seeing the carnage, the blood and 
that kind of stuff, and he was severely 
affected by that.  So anyway, we -- we stay
ed with the Bacalls.  The Soviets occupied. 
And then  my  -- one day, my  mo ther had notifie
d them that they are planning to get us.  
And one day my  mo ther just -- I could see he
r walking up.  She ha
d -- she had used an 
Army truck.  She worked her way up on an Ar my  truck, and that was -- by then, that was 

-- we had stayed with the Bacalls maybe six m
onths already, five or
 six months. And we 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
30 
went back .  I don't know wh ethe
r on a truck or a train.  I wa
s -- we were so deliriously 
happy, I don't rememb er.  And we came home, and we didn't even know wh at -- what my  
parents found in Chernowitz.  What they
 found was nothing.  Our -- our home was 
stripped and our property was gone, and the ap artment was -- somebody else was living 
in it.  And like you didn't even want to
 start making demands. So -- but -- so what 
happened  while we were gone is -- is a stor
y unto itself.  So my  -- my  parents were -- 
absolutely you hear the shoot
ing, and my  parents were obvi
ously  very frighten ed.  Every 
-- the Glotters and the Steinvitzes, the other 
two families.  So -- and Misha would come 
by or -- or the round guy, a
nd say "It's okay."  "Shooting."  "Not shooting."  "How?  I 
don't hear any." Well, when  
the shooting stopped and wh en -- wh en  Soviet Army  had 
occupied -- reoccupied, Misha 
came in {Crying} to see my  parents and the Glotters and 
the other people, and introduced himself as
 M o she(ph) Wiseman, a Jewish colonel from 
Moscow, who -- who was a partisan.  And a
ll those shootings were the partisans who 
were blowing up the -- the rails. A nd -- and 
the round guy was a general.  He was in 

charge of all the -- the -- the partisans in 
the Uk raine.  But this gave him a good cover.  
You know, they -- and the reason he was w
earing this round coat was he -- he was 
carrying a weapon, a long weap
on.  And he -- you know, they
 befriended th e parents, my  
parents, and the other people and helped th em 
leave, get transportati
on to go back to -- to 
Chernowitz. And -- and, you know, it -- it seem
ed like -- like my  dad was saying.  Wh en  
Misha said he 's Moshe Wiseman, a colonel,
 and th at woman he said was a good cover 

and she knew that -- who he was 
and what he was doing.  And th
is -- this guy, they spent 
time with him and, you know, it's  like -- like 
a novel. So when  we came home, you know, 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
31 
my parents filled us in.  And then my unc
le, my mother's brot
her who had lived in 
Moghilev, he -- he had been  badly beaten, bu
t when the Russians cam
e in they -- all men 
had to be conscripted.  So they  -- they fo und
 a job for him and -- but he was very sick.  
He -- they said he had a bloo
d disease.  We think he had 
leukemia. And he came to live 
with us.  And we -- we had an empty two-room
 apartment and a kitchen, a small kitchen, 
I guess, and the -- the -- the uncle when he came
 to stay  with us, we had -- I think we had 
cots that -- to sleep on, and I gave him my  co
t, or maybe my  mo ther told me to give him 
my cot.  And he -- he stayed with us for a 
few weeks, and he died in  January  1945, the 
day after my  birthday.  And he was lucid.  
He was lucid at my  birthday.  Wasn't any -- 
anything done.  I was nine, turn
ing nine, and he -- but he told
 me I'm gonna grow up to  be 
very beautiful, and I'm gonna be rich and ed
ucated.  And I think that took a lot of 
imagination because this scrawny little girl -- 
I mean I never became rich but I'm -- I'm 
okay, you know.  I'm -- I'm no th
reat to -- to the millionaires, 
to Gates, to Bill Gates, but -
- so he died the next day. And I went to scho
ol.  I don't -- there was no grad e.  I mean you 

just sort of went there 
and you learned Ru ssian -- 
Q:How -- how old were you?  Ho
w old were you at this point? 
A: Nine. 

Q: In Chernowitz? 

A:In Chernowitz, yes.  So the -- there were al
l sorts of ages.  So -- because these were the 
return people and nobody had 
actually been schooled.  So
 {Coughs} actually when I 
started, I think when  I started school -- you 
know, I turned ten.  And I don't rememb er 

where I learned it, asked me what I want to be
 when I grow up.  I said I want to be an 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
32 
architect.  I knew no more about architecture 
than -- than the cat, but it sounded like a 
good thing to say. So I don't recall what 
we learned, but we -- we went -- there was 
someplace to go.  And my brother had a diffe
rent -- for just older kids, but the same 
thing.  And -- but then he be
came -- my mother's 
sisters and Uncle Jupiter had gone to 
Romania.  They  didn't want to live under the So
viet rule.  My dad had a job, I think again 
at the Meloche Trust, which is 
the -- the dairy trust.  And -- but we didn't  have very mu ch  
of anything. So -- and we -- a
nd my  uncle persuaded 
us, persuaded my  parents to come to 
Bucharest, to go to Bu
charest.  So that was another sort 
of using forged papers for --  so 
they used the -- the different birthdays, an
d that's how we got 
to be -- we came to 
Bucharest.  I -- I remember I 
was in -- still in Chernowitz wh
en the war ended in Europe 
May 8th, 1945, and there were thousands of
 thousands of people on the square in 
Chernowitz.  And was a woman officer, you kn
ow, I never seen women in the Army , and 
she said, "This is a special day.  Today we
 -- we celebrate probelov(ph), free -- freedom 
and peace.  So that -- that was awesome. 
And we stayed in Chernowitz a few more 
months and then went to Bu charest.  And I don
't -- we -- we got to Bu
charest, I think, on 
a train.  But the -- the -- with the fear of
 the documents always.  And it became  now a 
fear of documents. We arrived in Buch arest in
 19 -- sometime in 1
945, and stayed there 
until 1946 when the -- wh
en the -- or -- or later, maybe -- 
yeah, '46, late '46 when the 
Nazis -- when the Soviets were occupying -- 
you know, the king -- when  the king was -- 
was being ousted, King Michael.  It wa
s becoming co mmunist and it was gonna be 
communist, and Un cle Jupiter didn't want to 
stay there.  And my -- my parents -- my 
parents -- an aunt and cousin were in Germa
ny already, and they  felt that we should leave 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
33 
there because nothing good is g
onna come.  We should
 leave the area. So again, you so rt 
of struggle and you -- you -- we lived in
 a one-room apartment or something in 
Buch arest, like a studio apartment.  And you 
struggled  to organize
 documents and visas 
and all this kind of stuff.  {Coughs} -- and in
 1946, we were leaving.  We had a visa for 
Germany, and a pass-through vi
sa to the other countries in
 between. My uncle couldn't 
get a visa, so he just contacted smugglers.
  There were always these smugglers and -- 
Uncle Jupiter.  So he paid somebody a lot of
 money and they -- on the -- the Hu ngarian 
border was still the Hungarian border.  So 
the smuggler took him 
to this little town 
waiting for the train, for a train, for the right
 conductor to be able to smuggle him over.  
Well, it took a couple weeks and he still hadn'
t gone.  So he said he would send fo r the 
women, when -- his wife and my  other aunt wh
en -- when he's on the other side. But then 
it had become commu nist already and you co
uldn't  leave.  So -- but the women had 
become anxious, so they -- they contacted the 
smuggler who tried to talk them out of it.  
They  also paid him a lot of money, and they le
ft their -- their beautif
ul apartment, all their 
possessions, and he to ok them to -- to the bo
rder town. Now, these -- these people must 
have had a brain freeze, because in a -- in a 
little border town where 
everybody is -- is a 
peasant, and you see these beautiful two women,
 the one with the long
 blonde hair, you -- 
you immediately conclude that there is some th
ing going on.  I mean 
so when -- when the 
smuggler -- the smuggler didn't want to take all 
three of them.  They talked him into it.  
He put them on the -- on a locomo
tive or something, and of cour
se they were all arrested, 
arrested and sent -- sentenced to  prison fo r f
our years.  But in th e meantime, our -- we 
had these visas and we went.  We left Roma
nia and went, and I lived in Prague for a 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
34 
while.  We lived in Prague for several months
.  Don't know why.  But we lived in Prague 
for several months in 1947.  And after that, we
 -- we went to Munich.  I stayed there until 
I came to the Un ited States. And I had -- so I 
didn't  go to school in Buch arest.  I had 
learned -- had some tutoring, 
you know, volunteer tutors. 
 But I learned -- I taught 
my self.  I was reading and writing and stuff lik
e that.  And the same was in Prague.  And 
then -- and when we came to M
unich, where -- where did we f
it in?  We didn't really fit 
in any particular.  There -- there was a school
 where, you know, we went every day and, 

you know, it was sort of teac
hing you life skills and stuff like that.  Intellectually, we -- 
we were self-taught. And came to the United Stat
es at the end of 1951.  So  I -- when  I say 
I grow up in Munich , I grew up basically ther
e.  And, you know, it was a lot of sort of 
empty time, a lot of -- grew up fast, dating,
 older people, you know
, was kind of -- And 
my  brother -- my  brother went to Switzerland to
 study so me kind of engineering, and he  
-- he came here two years after us.  He stay
ed there until he finished his course, his 
studies, and came to the States in
 1953.  '52 maybe.  Yeah, in 
'52.  It was only a year and 
some months in the summer.  And then he -- 
he went to college and -- oh, roll back.  He 
was drafted, and he was dr
afted a few months later. 
Q:By whom?  By who?  He was drafted 
by whom?  By the -- who -- who drafted him? 
A:The United States.  He came on a green card 
and he was arrest -- he was drafted.  He 
was drafted.  He was multilingual, as I was.  
They  didn't try _______ at the time.  Don't 
have to now, I guess. So he was drafted.  A
nd th e funny thing is my  parents wanted to  
stay in Germany, wanted to stay in Europe
.  But they  were concerned that my  brother 
would have to serve in the Ge
rman Army, or in the Europe
an Army .  They  didn't want 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
35 
that. So lo and behold
, we came to the United States.  
But once I got here, I had gotten 
used to it.  And my  brother, once he came on 
a green card, was drafted.  So th e -- but he 
was in basic training. The -- the co lonel -- you know, my  parents wo rried about him.  I 
worried about him, too.  Because, you know, in
 the basic training in the Army is a lot of 
Mickey Mouse stuff, clean your
 weapon, put it together, take it apart, make your bed, 

make -- shine your shoes.  Well, we didn't thi
nk he knew how to do th
at.  He's very smart 
and would become a very success
ful man, but these things are a skill unto itself.  So the 
colonel one day heard him -- st
arted talking to him and said to him "Where are you from 
and what language do you spea
k?"  And he says, "Okay, you'
re my aide from now on.  I 
want to learn French ." So he
 eventu ally was sent to Europe.  And I don't know if the 
colonel went, I don't recall, and he became part
 of the forerunner of the CIA.  He was for 
the Army Intelligence.  He was trained and 
they -- the Army Inte
lligence, he was -- he 
served the Army Inte
lligence.  They gave him a differe
nt name.  They put him in a 
private house -- they -- they 
rented a house for him in East
 Berlin.  And he was a spy, 
basically, for -- for three years. And he -- they
 wanted -- tried to persuade him that he 
should -- he could be this, you 
know, he was done with  the Ar
my, that he should do this 
as a -- as a job, that he should
 become -- take this on.  But 
we try to -- we talked him out 
of it eventually.  But tried to explain to him,
 "Listen, they're not gonna send you to Paris, 

they're gonna send you to Africa or somepl
ace." Well, anyway, he -- he went on to 
college and became a -- had a couple of degrees
.  And his job, his longest job, was for 35 
years at the Rand Corporation,
 The Think Tank.  He's very 
smart, and he's very good.  
And he died, unfortunately, 11-99.  That 's 1 4
 years ago. So -- and I got marrie d  in 1952.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
36 
I'd been here just months, here in Buffalo, an
d had no particular schooling, self-taught, 
learned -- I learned English by myself, sel
f-taught.  And in -- in Germany, nobody 
learned English.  The school we attended to  pe
riodically didn't  teach  English.  They just 
sort of kept you off the street, I guess.  
And I -- I taught my self English. And I tell 
everybody the story that we lived in -- we ha
d an apartment.  We 
lived in an apartment 
and we had a maid, Anna Marie.  {Coughs} --
 my mother -- my moth
er took ill in camp 
and she never basically  recove
red.  She had arthritis.  A
nd I think she was emotionally 
injured as well, but she had a severe arthritis.
  And, you know, the meds that you take fo r 
arthritis sort of harm you as well. But so
 in Munich, people hadn't seen African-
Americans.  And Anna Marie,
 the maid, was in the park 
and met a soldier that was 
African-American.  S o  one day he came to see her.  She told him sh e lives there.  She 

didn't  tell h im she works there.  So people 
saw him in the building.  And oh, my  God, 
what's gonna happen to us.  And he came to
 our door and rangthe doorbell.  And I 
opened th e door, and he said, "I would like to
 speak to Anna Marie."  And since I spoke 
English, I could tell him she doesn't live here
, she just works here, and sh e's not here.  
And spoke a few more words to him.  Very nice. 
 It was all very nice.  He was a nice guy. 
But the -- the -- I was a star 
for th e neighbors, because it wa
s -- people were frightened.  
They  had lived through the war and -- and this
 was a strange sort of person, you know, 
and they  just didn't know what to make of
 it.  And English was not spoken.  No body 
spoke English.  So it was -- mad e me a -- that
 was my good deed fo
r -- for the week. So 
there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
  My -- we -- my relativ es that were in 
Munich, my  cousin, a physician, well-know
n physician, had in th
e meantime g one to 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
37 
New York, moved to  New York , so
 we really didn't  have an
ybody in Munich. So I mean 
my  dad had a job.  I don't know wh at -- how 
good a job it was.  It may have been less 
than he's used to.  And he provided for his fa
mily, I guess.  And he -- so we also came to 
the United States, not only -- but primarily 
because my  parents worried that Armon 
would have to serve in a Germ
an Army.  So that's what br
ought me to the United States. 
Q:What do you rememb er about how you and 
your family were received in the United 
States as refugees or as survivors? 
A:In the United States? 

Q: Uh-h uh. 
A:Sort of half let's not touc
h them and half like the circus 
puppy or the circus performer.  
Half let's stay away, they were
.  But that's not only in Unite
d States.  That's Jews have 
done that, too.  Jews that were not deport
ed had the same attitude. And -- and I had come 
to understand -- to observe that later, that -- 
that, you know, that's th
em and that's  us, and 
somehow they deserved being 
deported.  It was on th e merits, not just on -- on some 
crazed anti-Semite.  It was on some merits.  
A nd that was one -- one part of it. And the 
other part of it was curiosity.  Oh, you were 
in concentration -- you mu st -- and you lo ok, 
you know, like everybody else, a
nd so  that -- that accounts for -- that sort of registered 
with me.  That accounts for my 
never having wanted to talk 
about it, that I just didn't  
want -- I never -- I never did. My -- since I sp
end a lot of time in Ca
lifornia.  You know, 
Spielberg has a show.  No, I didn't -- and my  br
other was married to -- his first wife was -
- her father was in the studio, a studio man, 
you know.  And he -- he wanted me to -- my 
brother I mean absolu tely would not, and th ou
ght well, maybe she's not as adamant. So I 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
38 
-- I -- that was in part, I didn't want to.  I mean
 there is -- there is 
a population that -- that 
chose to, and I give them credit that chose to. 
 I know Gerda Klein.  Gerda Klein lived in 
my  neighborhood in  Kenmore, Ne
w York.  So it was -- it was -- 
I give her credit.  It was 
courag eous.  It was -- well, I don't know 
ab out being courageous, but it was -- {Coughs} 
it was an affirmative thing to
 do. And it -- it brought atten
tion to  it, and she was okay 
with that, and her family was 
okay with that.  In fact, my
 -- my former husband had a 
busin ess with her husband, Mr. Klein, had a printing shop.  And my former husband was 
in advertising and, you know
, did that.  And the Kleins 
had three children within the 
same town, so at some point 
somebody collides.  But I think 
that the Kleins, as a model, 
were not as accepted as you woul
d think.  They were respected but not accepted.  That's 
my  interpretation. Just because -- you know, 
I -- some people don't see that distinction, 

perhap s.  I'm a shrink besides having a law degr
ee.  So the -- I think you can be respected 
without being accepted.  And I 
think the Kleins were respected but -- accepted means 
you're just a regular guy, yo
u're a regular woman.  That's
 acceptance. If you are singled 
out fo r something th at you had 
no choice about, or you had a choice about, that -- and 
people give you credit for that, that's not accept
ed.  That's respected. 
 But accepted is all 
the people.  So I -- I don't know if you see the 
distinction, but that's
 -- or you've ever 
noticed the distinction.  But I 
-- so I -- I didn't put it forth that
 I am -- when  people say to 
me "Where are you from?"  Or you say mo re. 
In fact, I was a college professor at one 
time, and some of the student
s didn't -- you know, like they 
don't  know accents.  So they 
would say "Dr. Schafler, ar
e you from New York ?" {L aughter}  "Or where are you 
from?"  So, you know, I would say "Oh, I'm from
 some other place."  I didn't want to go 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
39 
into it. So the -- the -- I did no
t want to attract attention beca
use of that.  So, but I don't 
think that Jews were as forthcoming as all that.  They were not forthcoming in many 
ways.  And -- and the mo re you -- you look aro
und, there were a lot of Jewish profiteers.  
I mean like -- like Mr. Jacobs was a profiteer 
in the sense that he earned money and he 
lived better and earned himself positions. And 
I was reading a book not long ago about 
the Wrightmans.  I don't know if the family 
name strikes you, but the Wrightmans are 
billionaire developers.  They have developed half of To
ronto or three-quarters of 
Toronto.  And th ey are Hungarian Jews, a
nd they bought their 
way out when -- when 
Hungary was going -- they bought their way out 
and they went to Tangi
er.  So they -- so 
that they wouldn't be consid ered profiteers. 
 Oh, and they  went into money laundering.  
That's  profiteering.  And th ere was so mu
ch money.  There was no place to launder 
money other than in offshore.  So they becam
e very, very wealthy. So for -- for people 
that don't know, they  said she -- that Mrs. Wrightman had a group of wo men and th ey 
were wrapping packages to send 
to the concentration camps. 
 Now, that is the stupid -- 
the second stupidist thing I've ever heard.  I ca
n't think of the first.  T h e idea that you can 
send packages to the -- to the 
concentration camp  and they have mail call, and they say 

"Sch mu l Kahn(ph), there is a package for you." 
 Are you kidding?  So they -- and -- or -- 
or that the Nazis would have allowed packag es
 to Dachau or Auschwitz or even Cariera 
de Piatra.  That is too stupi
d. Oh, and -- and she -- they wr
ite -- probably self-written.  I 
don't recall who wrote it.  But 
they write that they -- they 
had difficulty sending them to 
the camps.  They  have to send them thro
ugh Switzerland.  An
d the packag es had 
chocolate, coffee. Now, come on, give me a br
eak.  How ridiculous can you be?  So the -- 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
40 
the -- they had dehumanized.  They dehuman ized
 the experience.  If you think that -- that 
you can launder money for Nazis but you're 
sending ch ocolate -- chocolate to some camp 
somewhere, how dare you.  So  Jews did 
not -- did not do mu ch
, did not do mu ch. 
Q:When  did you become interested in re
searching your own st
ory and really piecing 
together your family history? 
A:I -- I didn't -- I mean I know -- I knew some of 
it, you know, as I -- as I went along.  I -
- the -- the Schafler side of it was done by 
somebody else.  When my  brother died, the -- 
the rabbi said, "Sch afler, are you related to my
 best friend Schafler who was a rabbi in -- 
in Toronto?"  I said, "I don't know."   And he
 showed me a picture, and he looked exactly 
like all the Schaflers.  All the Schaflers ar
e blonde, blonde, blue-e
yed or green-eyed.  
They  have perfect features.  Th
ey all look alike, you know.  So
 I said well, this guy mu st 
be related to me because he looks like my dad.  
So anyway, he says, "Well, I'll -- I'll -- he 
died, but I'll contact his wido
w." And he co ntacted this wi
dow, and she -- she l ived in 
Boston at the time, and she had -- but they  had 
lived in  Canada befo re, and then  he been a 
rabbi in Boston as well, and she had seven ch ild
ren.  They 're sort of all over Canada and -
- and Israel and New York  and wh atnot.  And 
she started researching th e Schafler family, 
and she sent me -- she would keep me posted,
 and she would send me all kinds of stuff 
about it, and she'd sen d  me -- she'd send me
 like a matrix outlining who went where and 
who did what. But then one day she called me  
and told  me that she's not gonna do -- and 
she had gone to Israel and she 
talked to people and she went 
to Vishnitz.  But one day she 
told me she's not gonna do that anymore be
cause she's getting married {Lau ghter}.  And 
she met this friend she -- who -- who died
, and sh e met up -- she connected to  her 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
41 
husband and she is ma rrying this guy. So  what
 I know is what I -- about the Schaflers is 
she did it.  And I -- and I just have it.  I bene
fited from it.  As far as
 the Hollars, that's my 
mother's family, is what I kno w is just the one generation prio r.  I -- I don't know very 

mu ch beyond th at. But what have come to me
, what I have -- I never thought much about 
it, many -- for many years, I ignored the -- it's
 been too painful to evaluate the Jewish 
contribution to the Holocaust and 
to the people that suffered.  It
's been too painful.  But I 
have come to understand -- I d
on't understand it.  I just no
tice it.  The Jewish people had 
been conditioned by religion th at
, you know, do what you're to
ld to do by authority.  No 
way could -- could ten Nazis with
 ten guns shoot 6,000 people.  No  way.  So  if they 
would have shot 200 people, 300 people, fu lly 5,700 or 4,700, whatever the ma th is, 

would have been alive, and -- and they offere
d no resistance.  My grandfather said "It's 
God's will we go" when they were ordered to 
-- to evacuate or get on the train. What I 
didn't  -- what I didn't say is -- about wh at ha
ppened  to the other people in Cariera de 
Piatra.  The people were shot on the way.  
They were shot just going to -- on th e way to 
Kiev.  And those that survived
 {Coughs} were buried, were taken to Kiev, to Babi Yar.  
You've heard -- have you heard 
of Babi Yar?  Yevtushenko'
s poem and stuff.  I have a -- 
a picture I'll show you later.  
I went to Kiev to Babi Yar to see Babi Yar a few -- ten years 
ago.  And Babi Yar was babi in Russian 
and Uk rainian means grandmother, and yar 
means a forest. But so this at 
the time was -- was outside of 
the city so they -- the Jews 
were dropped off there and told  to dig grav es a
nd they were shot right into the graves.  So 
nobody survived
 even for two days.  That was the 
end of all the people at Cariera de 
Piatra is that they -- th
ey were murdered there. 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
42 
Q:And how did you learn about that, the fate of
 that particular transport?  Did you learn 
about that much later? 
A:Later.  Later.  Later.  Later.  Much later, yes,
 yes.  We -- we didn't k n ow.  I -- I learned 
about it mu ch later.  And after Yevtushenko'
s poem, I wanted to go to -- to see it.  
Because we -- we had so many birthdates, my
 parents -- when my parents were alive, 
they were very worried abou
t that, that -- that somebody 
will find out.  They had been 
intimidated by -- by Nazis and stuff.  And -- and they -- they had trouble coping with me 
because -- and so had my brothe
r, by the way.  And the interes
ting part is that he -- he 
had high security wh en  he wo
rked for the -- for the REC and 
they never discovered that. 
And -- and he had a diffe
rent name.  Armon.  He was us ing the same initials, A rmon, and 
I can 't remember what last na
me they had given him, but 
Armon Schafler was his name. 
So -- but -- so my -- when my
 parents were alive, they 
were always worried that 
somebody is gonna find out.  What are they
 gonna do?  Where are 
they gonna send me?  
You know {Coughs}.  But -- but I didn't want
 to worry them, like 
why would I -- and I -- 
my -- so I -- I tell people when I was born, 
you know.  And it does not coincide with the -
- with my documents.  So 
my  parents knew that I am doi
ng that. Now, I married the 
second time.  I had divorced and married in Me
xico, because it's diffi
cult to divorce in -- 
in New York State at the time at
 least. So I {Coughs} need to
 take some water.  I -- we 
arranged that we would -- I would get divorced 
in Mexico.  That used to be the divorce 
capitol of the world, in Juarez.  And we'd  ge
t married ten minutes later. My -- I married, 
my husband was an attorney, and -- but my
 parents was worried about that, that 
transaction.  So -- and we flew right away to 
California.  So on th e ai
rport, just getting off 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
43 
the plane, my mother 
said, "Does he know your birthdat
e?"  {Laughing} The big secret.  
The big secret. So when my parents were aliv
e, I mean this was -- this was one of my 
instances when my parents were 
alive.  I didn't want to ca
use them grief, you know, to -- 
to travel, so my -- my passport said born in '
81 -- '31 or whatever.  And did not want to -- 
but -- but they worried  about me going to  Russia 
or the Ukraine.  They
 worried about that 
{Coughs} so I did not do th at. But after they 
died, I did, and that's what took me -- you 
know, nobody cares, I don't think they cared, 
but my parents cared.  And -- and I went to 
Kiev and I went to Babi Yar. 
 And Babi Yar has now the -- the City of Kiev  had grown 
around it, so it's now just a -- like a park.  This
 is a park and it has that -- that statute on it, 
and I photographed it.  But mo st people don't k
now about Babi Yar and stuff like that so -
- But anyway, I went to Moscow, and n
obody -- oh, and when I was in Moscow, 
somebody lo st my  passport, and {C oughs} -- I 
-- I didn't think for a second th at -- that it 
was -- had anything to do with -- with the 
false papers they got out of the Soviet 
occupied.  But at the same ti
me, a little bit, you th ink about it. So that -- that fear is 
{Coughs} -- and I have my  driver's  license -- my
 driver's license, if 
you were to take our 
driver's licenses, my  brother's and me were twin
s.  So my brother never told his wife.  He 
had been married for 27 
years to this -- this woman, and 
he never told her about that. So 
earlier this year, I went to California and sh
e had -- she had made some reservation for 
me, and she says, "Well, give me your -- your
 birthdate as it's  written on the -- on your 
driver's license."  So I told
 her.  She said, "Oh, my Go
d, that's my  brother -- my  
husband's ."  I said, "You're right, it is."  So
 you can change it and it doesn't matter.  It 
doesn 't matter.  But the fear is there and,
 you know, when  I would say "Mom, where are 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
44 
they gonna send me?  I 'm sta teless.  I 'm an Am
erican cit izen.  Where are they gonna send 
me?"  And maybe I'd like it if they do.  So
 the -- the fear. And -- and I think there is a 
Jewish fear.  There is a inherent fear.  
Maybe -- maybe it's just the generation th at 
experienced Naziism.  Maybe it's still -- a
lthough the Jewish paper, somebody sent me 

this article from the -- 
the D.C. Jewish paper that it said
 Jews have no opinion about some 
political thing.  Like why sh ou
ld they have an op inion?  I mean Amer
icans should have 
an opinion.  Why should they have an 
opinion? So  maybe -- maybe it's not as 

homogenized yet as I think, that that fear ha
s -- has been left.  But then Jews don't speak 
out about -- about Jewish slight.  Jews we
re silent in the '30s.  Bu siness was good, 
especially in the United States.  It was afte
r the Depression.  And they were selling arms, 
and they  didn't want to rock the boat.  
So they were silent.  I mean having a 
demonstration in -- in New York City is not 
enough, so -- but this has come to me later. 
When I married my first husband, he -- he wa s a staunch -- talked about Roosevelt, his 
whole family.  And Roosevelt sat with his 
lover he had in Beth
esda.  You know, you 
probably  heard that he had on th e corner, lik
e the second corner of Connecticut Avenue, 
there is a house on the hill and he
 used to go th ere every after
noon to  meet his lover.  And 
-- and Jews didn't -- w ere not an issue.  Jewi
sh blood being wasted wa
s not an issue.  So 
that had come to me later when
 I -- when I started looking at 
it.  And for me that's what I 
like about Israel.  They're pugnacious and they  -- they -- in a way they are like a four-

year-old who's pugnacious but dependent at th
e same time.  Israel is dependent on the 
Western World.  But at the same time, they
'r e  pugnacious, and they
 -- "Hey, I don't like 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
45 
this crap, yeah?  I don't -- I'm not gonna take th is."  So -- but that 
h as co me to  me mu ch  
later.  The fear of being Jewish
 has -- had persisted for a while. 
Q:So why did you decide to tell your story no
w?  Why did you decide
 to tell your story 
now? 
A:Well, first of all, because I -- I no longer fe
el constraint by -- by my constraints.  As I 
mentioned to you, when  -- when
 the man spoke, and you can pr
obably look it up in the -- 
who he was and -- look it up in the calendars, 
you know, I thought I'
m not doing that, you 
know.  I'm not looking at -- and, you know, all 
the people in California, I didn't want to 
have anything to  do with it.  But -- but I -- ma ybe it's an empowerment.  I have 
empowered my self. This happened to -- to me 
despite what I thought, despite me being 
innocent, and now I can tell yo
u about it and you didn't help
 me.  You did nothing about 
it.  The -- the people that we thought were 
-- we were helped by 
the people that we 
thought were victimizing us. 
 The camp  commander who hid, 
who said, "I saved as many 
of you as I could", and he didn't steal the m
oney, he didn't -- he didn't bribe himself.  He 
had the opportunity. And -- and the -- and Mi
sha and th e -- we never -- didn't know his 
name, the r o und guy, is {Cough
s} that used to give us 
food and say "Don't worry about 
that, just hang in."  Just -- just -- o r some da
ys when there was a lot 
of shooting, he'd  say, 
"Today is not a good day you 
should look out", you know, 
or something like that.  But 
he'd  come by almo st every day.  I can't reme
mber a day that he didn't. So these are the 
people that helped us that we
 thought were our -- our enemie
s, our -- that betrayed us.  
They  didn't betray us.  They  did wh at they 
could to su rvive themselves.  And in a way -- 
in the -- on the way of helping th
emselves, they helped  others. 
 This is a huge risk for the 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
46 
camp commander to hide 400 Jews.  This is a hu
ge risk {Coughs}.  And -- and to sort of 
minimize it, and probably he was 
scared stiff, but he said, "Oh, th ere's nothing th ere, just 
old stuff." So this is why I -- I feel empowered
 now.  I got it.  What I didn't get before, I 
got it now.  And I think it's a -- 
it's a moving story to tell.  It's 
-- it's -- this kid that didn't 
have any schooling went on to -- I started 
-- I took a course in college in interior 
decorating.  That's what you did in the 
'50s, you decorated your house.  And _______+ 
went on would take maybe something else 
similar. But later I -- I heard -- I took a 
psychology class, and I was so enthralled by wh
at the professor had to say that this was 

my  -- going to be my  life-long quest to study.  
So I went on and I -- I have a BA .  I went 
on fo r a Master's, and I have a Ph .D.  I have 
been in school for, I don't know -- in college, 
not -- actually for 20 years, yeah, and then 
I went for my  law degree.  I had -- I had 20 
years of college and no nothi
ng. And when I started college
, you still had to take gym.  
So I had to get special permission, I do not take
 gym.  And golf didn't count.  I used to 
play golf a little bit.  That didn
't count.  I used to take balle
t lessons for a long time.  That 
didn't  count.  Had to be gym, and I'm not sure
 what it had to be. I was just -- you know, I 
was way beyond that.  So -- so I have come a 
long way, I think.  I didn't become rich, you 
know.  I modeled in  between.  I have mode
led for artists, for ph
otography, you know, 
kind of stuff.  I was a college professor. 
 I had my  own psychot
herapy practice and my  
own office.  Self-made. In fact, my daughter, my children,
 are highly educated.  My 
daughter is a physician.  She'
s a distinguished physician.  She was a rogue scholar and 
she -- they both went to Ivy League schools.
  And she was a professor at Penn.  Now 
she's a big wheel in a drug company in 
-- drug co mp any -- pharma comp any, Merck.  

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
47 
And my son is a lawyer.  He went to Co
lu mb ia Law School.  And Ginsburg  was his 
professor, Justice Ginsburg.  So  -- and even  th
e next generation, the grandchildren, three 
of them at Cornell and one at Williams.  Ho
w -- how better can it get? So -- so it -- it can 
be done, and I did it.  So now I -- I feel no -- 
no constraints.  I -- if I'm not accepted, I 
don't care.  I mean I might 
be respected, but I don't know 
that any -- any concentration 
camp victims are accepted.  I don't know that.  I have not seen any eviden ce of that. I 
think that even those that have reached fame 
or wealth are sort of more like the circus 
entertainer than just -- just an
 ordinary person.  But that's  my  own view of that.  Elie 
Wiesel is s o meb ody  wh o  co mes t o  min d .   I me
an he's n o t -- he's ad mired but he's not -- 
and respected but he's not accepted, you know. 
 I mean he's not a regular guy, you know.  
To -- to be accepted, you have to -- you can 
be respected and be a regular guy, and he's 

not respected as a regular guy. So -- but
 I don't care now, you know.  I have 
accomplished a lot.  And those that
 don't want to accept me, go away. 
Q:Is there anything else you would lik
e to add that we haven't discussed? 
A:I -- nothing that, you know, I haven't -- I'm 
trying to think what 
I wanted to tell about 
the camp story that I omitted.  That to -- to 
illustrate the accept 
-- I felt as a child the 
acceptance versus the kindness. And as I told 
you before -- and I thi
nk you may want to -
- to make a point of that, that
 -- I told you that the Bacalls 
were not there when we were, 
and there were the Finklesteins.
  They -- they accepted us, yo
u know.  They  
-- they didn't 
do th eir duty to -- to some unkno
wn whatever.  They accepted us.  We were children, and 
they -- we were special.  And th
e way they  treated us, you know
, sort of -- we were dirty, 
I'm sure we were, and they -- 
they  put us in their beds an
d they cleaned our clothes and 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
48 
they watched us sleep.  That's acceptance
. And -- and -- and they  were poor but they 
fought for us, to keep us
.  They were not poor -- I mean 
poor, I'm u sing it in relation to -- 
but they  were not wealthy.  And two mo re m
ouths to feed, I don't know th at it was easy.  
But they were -- they were -- 
they wanted to share because 
they -- they accepted us. So 
not a big -- the Bacalls were wonderful and 
all their frien ds.  They had parties and 
physician there, and he used to ex amine us and he was their close friend.  An d they were 
wonderful.  But then they were
 rich.  And the maid did mo st of it, and the chau ffeur did 
the rest of it, so they -- it's 
easier k ind of thing.  It was 
not -- they -- I don't think they 
accepted us.  They so rt of a "noblesse oblige"
, if you know anything in French , that so -- 
that kind of thing. And I thi
nk that -- that the acceptance fo
r minorities in general is just 
not what it should be.  It should -- just not
 what it should be.  I mean when  -- when I 
came to this country , I thought being Jewish, 
being a Holocaust survivor, is like being, 
you know, a toddler, you grow 
up and you move on, 
but it isn't.  Nobody -- you're not 
treated like that.  So therefore,
 you internalize that you're not treated like that. We also 

thought that, you know, we -- we 
fought fo r the '60s and all 
the ma rches and stuff and we 
thought well, equality for -- for African-Amer
icans, for black people would come.  And 
then you would just think well,
 this is another woman and she's great or she's awful or 
just another guy and he's  great or he's -- didn't 
happen.  It didn't  happen. The -- so this is 
one of the reasons that I decide
d now to -- she's the one that is
 the survivor.  I mean when 
-- when -- when Madoffs, the pe
ople that gave the mo ney, you know -- you know, we all 
-- you probably know, you saw the list, I'm 
sure you saw the list, you -- you think -- you 
thought to yourself how coul
d people that have that mu ch
 money be so stupid?  How 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
49 
could they not know wh at goes on?  How 
co uld they not know 
that -- that when 
everybody else pays 3 percent and somebody pays
 10 percent that is illegal or -- or fraud. 
But people looked at Wiesel, 
esp ecially, Elie Wiesel, and th
ought how could he do that?  
I'm sure you know he lost a lot of money.  And he
 said he didn't want to talk about it.  He 
feels that.  He feels that his -- his -- his burde
n is -- is higher than  someone else's burden.  
You know, somebody else had lost that mu ch
 money.  A lot of people spoke out.  He 
never spoke out, because he feels that -- that 
he's not accepted, and for him would just be 
another piece of evidence not to accept him.  
No, another reason not to accept him. I had 
-- I had wonderful childhood, you know, wonde
rful childhood.  That's not true.  I had 
wonderful childhood until -- until -- but I ha
d like Ruth, I had very good parents, 
wonderful parents, although th
ey were more conservative a
nd fearful as they got older 
and fearful because of wh
at they went through.
  They were -- they 
were just -- we were 
their priority, and if we -- they didn't give 
us food when we were
 in camp was because 
there was none.  And we didn't have to ask 
and say "How come we're not eating?"  If it 
would have been possible to get food, they  woul
d have gotten it. So -- 
so this kind of total 
devotion.  And I remember my
 -- when we came back 
from Botoshan and we were 
walking down th e street and we saw my 
dad come walking, {C oughs} coming toward s 
us, and he hugged me and he 
said, "You came back to your 
poor old father."  And I'm 
thinking to myself how coul
d he doubt it?  How could he
 doubt that we would come 
back?  Yo u would make a choice you left luxu
ry and you came to your
 poor -- poor old, 
poor father.  How could he doubt that?  That 
he -- they were very l
oving kind of -- if not 
dad -- my dad was more affectionate than my  mother, but both of them had the priorities 

Interview with Pepi Schafler 
 
50 
taking care of the children. So -- so this -- this
 kind of thing gives y
ou a basis.  I didn't 
have to worry about that they wo uld not protect 
my interests.  So -- so you take this basis 
with you into life, this
 early -- or this -- this approval, yo
u know.  I had come to -- to -- to 
-- when you go through
 marriages and stuff like that, 
and you realize that only good 
parents love you.  Everybody else has a mo tive
, wants you to  love them back, wants to be 
married to you, uh, whateve
r.  But only loving parents lo
ve you because they -- they 
wanted to  have children and they  -- they -- th
ey feel the responsib ility to do the best by 
you.  And when  they  led us -- they sent us 
away, they wanted us 
to survive.  If they 
couldn't assure their survival, they wanted some
one else to -- they wa
nted us to survive. 
So an yway -- yeah, I 
can think of -- the woman in Ru th
, she -- she talks about -- I don't 
know if you are familiar with the book, but 
she talks about hers was a mo re modest.  
They were sort of hand to mo
uth kind of people.  And so an
y -- any bit of deviancy in life 
affected them immediately {Coughs).  So 
different experiences may have made her 

different -- her attitude different. 
 That's  all I have to say. 
Interviewer: Thank you ve
ry much for your time.
