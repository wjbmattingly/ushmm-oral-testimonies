Interview with Irene  Shapiro 
March 27, 1992 
Ipsmont, Ne wYork 
 
Q: Today is March 27, 1992.  I™mAnthony Di Iorio 
and I™m at the home of Mrs. Irene Shapiro in 
Ipsmont, Ne wYork and I™m here on behalf of the United St ates Holocaust Memorial Museum 

inWa shington to interview Mrs. Shapiro abouther experiences and those of her fa mily during 

the Holocaust.  Good afternoon.   
 

A: Good afternoon to you.    

 

Q: I thought perhaps we could begin by
 having you tell us where you were born. 
 

A: I was born in the small Ukrainian town, Brezan
y.  It was part of what™s  now known a s  the 
Polish Ukraine and the breadbasket of both Poland 
and the Ukraine and later the Soviet Union. 
 

Q: And when were you born there? 

 

A: 1925, which was ancient history of course, and we
ll, I was born there as 
I explained to you.  It 
was almost accident al, certainly no
t historically awaited, and that 
is, I was -- my parents were at 
that time living in a town on theVi stul a River befo
re it goes into the Gdansk Bay. The name  is 

Gludjan.  However that time there were no, very 
few Jewish people, perhaps, and no rabbis and 
no moyels and so my mother in her eighth or ni
nth month of pregnancy 
went by train two days 
back to Brezany where a mi dwife would deliver 
just a girl.                                          
 

Q: Just a girl? 
 
A: Just a girl. 

 

Q: We re you an only child? 

 

A: No.At that point I was the 
one and only, but later on anothe
r ﬁjust a girlﬂ came along but she 
was born in Gludjan. 
 

Q: So you were born in Brezany when it was part of Poland. 

 

A: Brezany became  part of Poland in 
1918 with theTr eat
y ofVe rsailles. 
 

Q: And you grew up not in Brezany but in Gludjan? 

 

A: Gludjan.  Until 1938 I lived in that pa rt.  It 
was known as the corridor.  It was everybody™s 
transit point since 
ancient times, since theTe
utonic orders yet. And in 1938 my fa mi l y was 
forced to leave the corridor or ____ and went to 
Bialystok, and that was an entirely different 
part of Poland.  It was the for merly Russian 
part.  Poland was under occupation for 150 years, 
and that part of Poland was a czarist part.  So
 everybody spoke Russian an
d it had the looks of a 
Russian part.  It was poorly ma intained stre
ets, whereas Gludjan was a western German, 
typically German town, and in 
1938 for one year I attended the 4
th
 grade of junior high school, 
Polish junior high school in the so-called Drus
zki Gymnasium which was the most expensive 
but very modern academically very advanced ju
ni or high school and high school. And then I 

entered the high school in 1939 but the 
high school became in the Soviet 10
th
 year school ____.  
The Soviets occupied as part of Poland.This wa
s the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement.   It was 
fortunate for us as I told you before. The Ge
rmans did come  to Belsic for one week and 
promised us a proper, final solution even then, 
but the Soviets intervened and so we lived under 
Soviet occupation and most ordinary people, and especially from
 the viewpoint of a child we 
had a very good time. This was the time  when they
 sort of tried to schmaltz up to us kids, tried 
to get us to the Pioneer Organization and the Co
unselor Organization and politicized us and etc., 
etc., etc.  I™ll never forget myself screaming 
at our landlord: ‚if you don™
t fix that toilet I™m 
going to tell on you.™ This was the time
, but generally it was a norma l time . 
 
Q: You™re talking about the Russian occupation? 

 

A: The Russian occupation. I wanted to set the reco
rd straight.  Pe ople are expecting us to say all 
bad things about the Sovi ets.  No
t at that time. They were ve
ry careful about anti-Semitism.  
They put people in jail for anti-Semitic expr es
si on, so I saw absolutely, I sa w nothing, but of 
course my fr iends whose fathers were factor
y owners and such were sent to Siberia. 
 

Q: And what was their crim
e?  Being a class enemy? 
 

A: Bring class enemy having employe d and not havi
ng workers testifying for them. Apparently if 
the workers testified and intervened they mi ght 
have been given some  jail sentence but their 
fa mily was not removed and otherwise they were 
removed especially if they were very wealthy 

and didn™t get out.  Most people who had that 
kind of money could 
also get out because 
Lithuania at the beginning was not yet a Sovi
et republic until 1940. There were quite a few 
months and ma ny peopl e did go through Lithuania,
 Roma nia and such.  Some  even got to 
Palestine at that time .  M a ny had gone to China and so forth. 
 

Q: Did any me mbers of your fa mily go to Palestine? 

 

A: My uncle left Poland mu ch before that as a 
young law student from Le mb
erWol f as a Zionist 
and -- 
 

Q: That™s  your father ™s  brother? 

 

A: That™s  my fa ther ™s  brother and he was in Israel
 until very recently.  In
 fact, I did not know, he 
adopted me . You see, I was nineteen and a half 
when the war finished and was still adoptable.  I 
think it was still until twenty-one. And he a
dopted me .  But I didn™t know and I went to the 
United St ates and he was just heartbroken, and I w
ould have been his daught
er in Israel while I 
was already in the United St ates. 
 

Q: Could you tell us more about growing up in Pola nd, as a little girl and then as a young adult? 

 

A: We ll, the times I had in Grujan were not particularly happy for me  personally because I had a 
very strict father, still theAustrian school wh
ere you™ve got to be home on time, you can™t  go --
you can™t  pal around with some body whom we don™t 
know.And that let out most of t he Jewish 
boys and girls that I knew. They we re all daught
ers and sons of lower me rchants and me rchants 
and as I™m told by a friend whom I know now, my
 parents were stuck up. And I mi ssed on this 
and I interpreted all th
is as it was I who wasn™t  popular, nobody liked me , I had no friends and 
so forth. And I became --I was very bright, and ex
cellent st udent, so I di dn™t  suffer any anti-

Semitism. This was a Polish girl
s™ Gymnasium; I was the only Je
wish child in class, but so 
good a student that I was always at the top of the 
list all the time.  But I wasn™t  very happy as 
very young teenager. Also most of t he kids, they 
were a little older than
 I was and looked down 
upon me .  But when I went to Bialystople, that ma
de my day.  I was in a Jewish school with all 
Jewish girls and boys who all 
loved me .  I became not only popul
ar but I was voted in a an 
S.O.G.O. whatever, students™ orga
ni zation president prior to the co
mi ng of the Soviets, and then 
after that when the Soviets ma rched in I ran into a problem because they voted me  in but the 
Soviets didn™t  want to have a non-Communist, 
and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist.  
We ll, that wa s the worst thing you should have st
ated. They were forced by my colleagues to 
let me  be, to be the president of their Utchco
m the student  committee, 
but at home my  mother 
packed my valise and waited for the NKVV then 
-- the KGB now -- to come  and take me  a way 
cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak 
of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I 
defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very
 close to Marxism.  In fa ct, Marxists, the 
Zionists and we the Jews have the same  right to
 feel proud of our nationa
lity, as did the other 
Soviet republics.  I in essence negated the Jewish
 question of St alin, the 
little pamphlet, that  the 
Jews are not really a nation because 
they don™t have a land of their own. 
 

Q: Sounds like your heart belongs 
to your uncle in Pa lestine. 

 

A: It sort of disappeared on me .  I was very easily
 swayed to look the othe
r way and then I joined 
the Pioneers, you know, which wasn™t  much of a plan
 either, and I sort of had the left-winger ™s 
leniency because of my revolt ag
ainst my parents and my grandpare
nts.  I played with daughters 
of supers in the house and working kids and so 
forth.  So, in Soviet Bialystok I was very busy 
with political affairs of the school.  I was on the committee and I was in charge of the 

newspaper and what not, very, very
 involved with that. Ve ry lit
tle time for my poor mother, and 
it was the fi rst time in her life that she didn™t 
have a servant. You had to have a doctor ™s 
certificate to be entitled to a ma id and she 
didn™t have.  I feel very guilty about that. 
 

Q: Your activities as a student and with this 
paper, was this always in Polish orYi ddish? 

 

A: No, no the school became a Russian school, a school
 with a Russian language of instruction.  I 
am fluent, or was at least till the --. 
 

Q: You™re fluent in Russian? 

 

A: Oh, absolutely.  I was a so-called otlichnica 
which means I had all ﬁAﬂs
 and therefore I could 
enter the university without an exam. And base
d on that I was able to get my Regents, my 

graduation di ploma because the list of these otlic
hnica was kept somewhere.  I came here to the 
Soviet consulate, where they piously tried to
 say to me  wha t  are you doing inAmerica, you 
should go back to the Soviet Union.  But they 
did get me  testimony of so- a nd-so, I gave the 

name of my directorthatI was 
a very good student ---- otlichnica. 
 

Q: You were conducting your
 own pro-Zioni
st activity? 
 

A: Oh, no, I knew better within a month. This
 was in the beginning.After people started 
disappearing and after my friends came  to sc
hool crying, I knew better.  It was just the 
beginning; no, after that I neve
r owned up to anything other, oh, I fervently, I very much -- I 
really enjoyed what was happening. You have to 
understand this. They ma de us, as kids feel 
very important.  I discussed this with the pe
ople who survived that. We  a ll had the same  

feeling. Wh o cared what they did to the grownups, 
or the capitalists.  I me an we were kids and 
they had all kinds of things for the 
kids. They had a way of getting us. 
 
Q: You™re referring now
 to the Communists?  
 

A: Ye s. And, well, we were too young. You couldn™
t even think of being a Communist.  In fact, 
that isn™t what they were
 interested in. They wanted us to
 be supportive, and we were, some  of 
us at least.  I was one of them. 
 

Q: How would you describe or summarize the po
litical information of the Jewish community? 
 

A: You see, Bialystok always ha
d a left-wing population. They were
 not Communists; they were  -
----.  It was the second interna
tional.  I don™t know, besides the l
eaders who were sent out, some  
of them, most of them I think, switched. Th
ey had a large workers 
population that possibly 
support them and the rest were as anybody else.  
I was very opportunistic. That was the way to 
get a job. That was the way to get ahead and my
 father had a warm feeling about the Soviets 
because really they saved his life, you know. 
 He was caught up in the revolution.  He was 
captured as anAustrian prisoner of war and wh
en they took him out of t hat prison, it was going 
from whites to reds, from whites to reds, and the reds --- 
 

Q: You™re talking aboutWo rldWa r I and then the Re volution?   

 

A: 1917 -- that™s right, and he was when the reds 
came , he was pronounced to be a white, or was it 
the other way around, one way or the other.   
No, no, no.  So they were supposed to execute 
him, and they did apparently, but one of the la
dies there whom my father was in love with 
traded hi s freedom for some money or what a
nd he became -- they liberated him and he was 
able to go home , so he was very, very thankful to them. 
 

Q: How did your father get to be a judge? 

 

A: He was the bandleader in the army.  He was, 
I think, an officer.  I 
have a feeling that the 
bandleaders had to be. Ye s, yes. 
 

Q: In the Polish army? 

 

A: Polish army.  He was at that time , when he
 was, after the Revolution, he was offered the 
freedom of joining of them forming Siberian legi ons of --- which he did and via the Far East 

through China, Hong Kong, he went around through 
Persia, I would say, through the Persian 
Gulf and so forth, and Suez I would say and came b
ack home , in the legion. And stayed in the 
Polish army till much aft e r Poland wa s formed a nd 
still was fighting with 
the Soviet Union.  He 
was in the mi ddle of the Battle ofWa rsaw, the famous battle, and christ ened forever by that fact 

and had difficulties with the 
Soviet people because of that. 
 

Q: What was he by vocation? 

 

A: My father was a violinist.  He was desper
ately trying to play in
 the Huberman Symphony 
Orchestra in Palestine at  that time and some
how couldn™t get out, but 
he was an excellent 
violinist.  He was an excellent  violinist but th
ere was absolutely no ma king a living that way in 
Poland for a Jew. And he mi ght have tried ot
her symphony orchestras too, and he couldn™t get 

in; he couldn™t  get out, get out. As a ma tter of fa
c t , my father had anAmer ican visa. As late as 
1939 a visa was waiting for him inWa rsaw, but not for us and not for my mother. 
 
Q: Just for your father – 

 

A: And he refused to go. 

 

Q: Had he tried to get it? 

 

A: Ye s.  My uncle here in Ca lifornia got him the vi
sa but refused get it for his family. That was the 
way it was done in the days past. The husband 
would come  and then bring his family, but my 
father knew better.  He knew the war was comi ng and so he didn™t go. 
 

Q: Now where did your father grow 
up?   He was born in Brezany? 

 

A: He was born in the same  town, Brezany and that
™s where he grew up.  He was the oldest of 
three children of my gr
a ndfather who always impressed me
 as anAustrian sergeant who 
ma rches through town and everybody would bow to
 him and that again was an oldAustrian 
household with a very strict father and I guess my
 father perpetuated this.  I think I broke the 
vicious cycle.  I became the democratic parent. 
 

Q: Your father was strict. 

 

A: My father was extremely strict.  I think that 
he realized what he was 
doing when he was taking 
his exams in pedagogy.  He would tell me  
ﬁHmm, now I know why you always say no and 
never yes.ﬂ And I guess he had an id
ea he was not raising us properly. 
 

Q: When he spoke to you when he was being st
rict, did he speak to you in Polish or German?  
 

A: No, only in Polish. We  spoke Polish at home. 

 

Q: Was he strict  when it came to religious matters? 

 

A: No. We  were not religious. 
 Most westerni zed Jews were r
eally once a year, one day or two 
days Jews, so called and that is they™d go 
to synagogue on Rosh Hashanah andYom Kippur.  
My parents were keeping traditi
on in a modern sense. All th
ese modern children™s holidays 
were ma intained. The little community in --- ma
intained all the holidays and they had a Zionist  
organization to which I was not allowed to belo
ng but nevertheless I was taught Hebrew. They 
imported a teacher fromWa rsaw, a young ma n w
ho taught us boys and girls Modern Hebrew 
and religion with it. To that extent we  were 
Jewish, with all the holidays maintained more or 
less the wayAmerican Jews, those who are not
 Or thodox, the sort of 
social life centering 
around the suburban synagogue, the reform te mp le.  
That is more or less what it was like. 
 

Q: How about your grandparents? 

 

A: My grandparents were modern t
oo, but a little less, because they
 still kept  a kosher house and I 
had the most mi serable time to re me mber whic
h knife went where and why I shouldn™t  take 
butter with the same  knife or fork.  I was just fl
abbergasted but to that 
extent they were more 
religious, but my grandmother did not have the 
wig, and again they didn™t go to, they did not, 

they ma intained, they lit candles for 
Sabbath. We  didn™t, not very much, no. 
 
Q: Did they live  in Brezany?  

 

A: They lived in Brezany, ye s. 

 

Q: How did your father get to _____? 

 

A: Again another not very large town that nobody ever
 heard of. Another accident.   His army unit 
was sent to, this was a very big army  
and air force base.  I think it was the 67
th
 -- Polish army 
some thing, and that™s  where he stayed and that™s
 where he was discharged and he fell in love 
with this little town.  He played at  that  tim
e in cafes, and they had a French-style café where 
you would sit and have  coffee and eat a very fine 
piece of cake and listen to some  niceVi ennese 
violin playing. 
 

Q: He was a violinist. 

 

A: Ya h. And the orchestra leader. 

 

Q: Oh, orchestra leader? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: He had his own violin?  Wh
at type of music did he --- 
 

A: (Cough) I™m sorry.  Almost any kind, but I would surmise that if it was a café it was chamber 
music of the lightest type,Vi ennese, Schubert.  
Ours was a very musical home; I played the 
piano, my fa ther played the violin, my sister 
danced, and this was our trio. We  had Friday 

coffee hours with Germa n friends of my father would be invi ted for ﬁcafé mit za me nﬂ which 

meant coffe e  with cream, and the children and the father would perform.  
 

Q: How about your mother?   Did she – 

 

A: My mother refrained.  She was an operetta a
nd an opera buff from herVi e nnese time s and she 
would sing a little but she did not perfor m, no.  Sh
e was a very sweet, soft, very kind person.  I 
will never forget my mother givi ng br ead in a concentration camp to a child. That was not 

done. 
 

Q: What did your father do for 
a living once he left the army? 
 

A: He was playing in the café for a while and me
t some  people and drank with those musicians ----
- because when I went back to Poland in 1956 I called up some people who said to me , ﬁAh, 

that was a musician; they don™
t make them nowadays this wa
y.™  So he was still known. 
 

Q: I recall when we were looking at photos of
 your father --- he was a teacher, wasn™t  he? 
 

A: He was having me mory loss spells when he 
was giving concerts ---Well that™s what he was 
doing in Gdansk; he probably went to give concerts, and he wa s in the mi ddle of something 

______ and he would take bromides to be able to 
play, and finally the doctors told him ﬁSir, you 

better give it up.ﬂ So he did.  He went back
 to Lumber____ and whatever pedagogy classes and 
music appreciation and whatever
 else he had to do and t
ook exams with everybody at home  
frightened out of their wits while he was st
udying and took the exams one or two or three 
evenings and passed and got his license. And 
he started teaching music in a German school, 
Folkschule and Gymnasium which 
is the high school, more than a high school. A high school 
plus. And that™s  how he fini
shed his career.  He was alwa
ys a musician; once a musician, 
always a mu sician.  So he still entertained for 
the Jewish community, and he gave of hims elf or 
organized a ma ndolin orchestra; he was an extr
emely gifted musician.  He  played one, two, 
three, four, maybe five instruments besides the 
violin.  He orchestrated
 his own mus i c.  He 
wrote excellent scores for the s
ilent movies. This was a gift. 
 He was an excellent conductor 
also, a very --- I watch so me and I see -- very sad 
-- when I think of my father; that ™s the kind he 
was, and very gifted, wrote his 
own music, orchestrated almo st
 anything and he performe d all 
through his life with the children.  Kids were ve
ry fond of hi m; he was very handsome.  Now I 
have friends who would say ﬁHah, well of 
course he looked at me  once or twice!ﬂ 
 

Q: These friends who were students– 

 

A: Ye s, they were having a crush on him, and he
 conducted choral groups in all languages. We  
spoke aboutYi ddish; in Bialyst
ok this was a literary
Yi ddish not just a jargon, a beautiful 
language, and some how he ma stered it.  He must
 have been able to read it -- theYi ddish 
alphabet -- and he taught the stud
entsYi ddish folk songs which I sing to this day with my 
guitar. And just a very gifted person; that™s  
how he died.  I wa s told by people who got out of 
___ Majdanek in October, that they™d seen him 
in camp orchestra.  So they must have gotten 
him a violin; his was taken right away. 
 

Q: These friends who were students – 
 
A: Ye s, they were having a 
crush on him and he conducted 
 

Q: In Novembe r  of 1943? 

 

A: ™43. And I am told that the or
chestra people were 
the last to go. 

 

Q: So he went to his ma rtyrdom because --- ye
t in the 1930™s he was teaching music to German 
students. 
 

A: How he got to teaching Germans  -- I think 
he  started with the Ge
rmans because he spoke 
German.  M y teachers -- all my music teachers were German. We palled around with 

ma ny____; they were very lovely people. They 
were all Socialists by the way__.  He dealt not 
with the Deutsche Reich.  He dealt with theVo
lkdeutsche. They were much less anti-Semitic 

than were the Poles. And those were our frie
nds and they, I am told, behaved very, very nobly, 

by my friends in ____ today. And these were hi
s friends and I guess they lined up some  kind of 

contact for him both for ___ and here and then ne
xt step was to become  a teacher for the high 
school, for the elementary and the high school. 
 I doubt if the Polish high school would have 
had a Jew. There wasn™t  a single Jewish teacher there, no.  But they did. 
 

Q: But he got along well with German community in Brezany?  

 

A: Until ™35, 6, 7, whenever, when the studentsstarted wearing their swastikas. What do you 

mean, you have a Jew? !  Not everybody knew he wasa Jew.  H-A-S-S, S-F as it is written in 
German is not a Jewish name , andAdolph was not. 
 

Q: ---nameinGermany.  

 

A: So they got to know it when it was important
 to know and when the director of the school, 
whose name  was Hildebrand, I couldn™t  forget, wr
ote the mos t  beautiful letter, ﬁI am ashame d 
to have to dismiss you, but such are the times, and I wish you the best of luck, and you are a 

fine, fine musician, and so forth.ﬂ  He cherished 
that letter. Those were theVolkdeutsche. The 
few who were ashame d of what was happening, but
 times were changing, and it was in Poland.  
They weren™t free to ma rch as Nazis; it was all hidden. 
 

Q: When was he dismissed?  

 

A: 1938. That was after theAnschluss of Czechoslovakia. 

 

Q: After the Sudeten – 

 

A: The Sudeten, right.  So at th
at point it was obvious that Pola
nd was on it™s way to becomi ng the 
next customer. 
 

Q: And he was dismissed because he wa s Jewish. And who ran, who financed the sc hool? 

 

A: That school was financed from Ger many. This 
is why they had to dismiss him.  Perhaps if it 
was a Polish school they would not
 have -- no, they couldn™t have 
dismissed him on that -- that, 
the principal ma de sure that he™d know that 
he wasn™t  being dismissed because he was an 
incompetent teacher but that he was --- 
 

Q: The mandat e came from Berlin? 

 

A: Ye s. ___. On racial grounds. 

 

Q: How were your father and mother ™s  
relations with Poles in that ---? 
 

A: Ve ry good.  She was a good neighbor, ‚cause wh
en we went to my apartment the neighbors 
would say, ﬁAch, that was a house where you coul
d always borrow a glass of vinegar.ﬂ And I 
reme mber going to funerals of people, and it wa
s a very good relationship, and once again, this 
was a non-Jewish town, and until this anti-Jew
ish sensitization happened via students, the 
National Democratic Polish Party where they had 
picket lines in front 
of stores -- ﬁDon™t buy 
here, buy ___,ﬂ there wasn™t  any anti-S
emitism.  It was comp letely unknown.  
 

Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends? 

 

A: Ye s. All of my -- I was the only Jewish student
 in my class, so sin
ce I was not allowed very 
often to meet with my Jewish friends, because th
ey were freer and they could do things on their 
own, they weren™t Œ it was important, it was 
described in my home  as a ____ you see, 
ﬁupbringingﬂ, the proper one, how to
 sit at the table, and what to 
say, and when to say, and how 
to say thank you, when to come  home, and --
- the Polish Jews, comi ng from Poland proper 
didn™t quite, it was the nouveau rich
e sort of atmosphere as opposed
 to the grandfather to father 

to daughterAustrian upbringing and so my pare nt
s were afraid that I would learn bad things.  
So, yes, I was allowed to play with the daughter
s and sons, daughters, no sons, daughters of the 
Polish officers and so forth who went to my school. 
 
Q: No Jewish friends – 

 

A: Ye s, a Jewish friend and she™s alive and in R
hode Island and I just discovered her.  She™s a few 
years older.  She was the daughter of 
an engineer, also with a good upbringing. 
 

Q: Did you notice any difference between the Germans and the Poles? 

 

A: The two didn™t  mi x.  Not at any time. The 
Ger mans were very large -- they were business 
people and very largely gentry more or less, 
so they were living on the outskirts and had 
gardens and such.  No. 
 

Q: How about in relations with Jews, the way Ge
rmans dealt with Jews and the way Poles dealt 
with Jews? 
 

A: Germans ha d no dealings with Jews other th
an my father because there wa s 150 fa milies of 
Jews and the Germans ke pt to themse lves.  It 
was a tightly closed community.  My father had 
dealings with them because he organi zed thei
r community house activities.  He was very well 
regarded until the onslaught of Hitler. 
 

Q: Earlier you me ntioned there was an increase 
of anti-Semitism.  Did you notice any changes in 
the school that you were attending?  
 
A: Yes.  I personally di dn™t have any attack; I 
was accepted.  I think par
tially because my father 
was an offic e r of the Polish army.  He was th
e proper Jew, but my friend, the one who™s now in 
Florida told me  she was badly mi streated.  Shewas a poor st udent.  It still didn™t compare with 
what we had to -- it was a kind of gentlema n™s 
agreement. That™s  what we had. It didn™t  
compare with what was happening in towns wher
e ther e were a lot of Jews and the National 

Democratic Party.  Don™t forget, these were the 
time s where the Jewish students had to sit in a 
separate portion of the university
 where ritual slaughter was being forbidden and where Foreign 
Minister Beck was a German and ___ who 
was pro-Jewish or at least benevolent 
 

Q: Notanti-Jewish? 

 

A: Wa s ___ after ™35 and ___ who was the field ma rsha
l that time was my fa mily™s personal friend.  
He come s from Brezany. That was the funny part
 but I don™t think he would have stood up for 
Jews. 
 

Q: Just the fact  that he established the quotas at  the university .. 

 

A: The universities.  It was e
ither numerous klauses or numerous.  InWa rsaw you had klauses and 
in (? ) you had klauses, but they had the Jews. 
 

Q: During these years di d you know who Hitler was? 

 

A: Ye s, yes.   I knew he was .. 

 
Q: What was being said of him in the town? 

 

A: We  were busy.  I guess the Jews of (?) were busy with Polish anti-Semitism because at  that  
point they were having all this happening but we 
knew.  I now read the letter that my American 
relatives had that my father wrote in 1938.  ﬁWe 
ar e heading for a catastrophe.  Help us. We ™re 

sinking.ﬂ I cried bitterly.  ﬁHelp 
us!ﬂ  He tried Holland, he tried 
the poor relatives they had here 
in the Bronx and he knew.  So 
my parents knew.  I was as much aware as the averageAmerican 
junior high school student. 
 

Q: Do you wish to elaborate on .. 

 

A: Okay.  I was about that much involved.  I re
ad the children™s versi
on of the Polish-Jewish 
newspaper ﬁNash Schagloneﬂ which came fromWa
rsaw.  It was primarily jokes and puzzles 
and stuff. 
 

Q: So these were probably the days when your fath
er ™s  beginning to try to
 get a visa to go to 
America, that you me ntioned earlier. 
 

A: Yes.  I think he tried in
 ™37 or ™38.  I would say ™38. 
 

Q: Afterbeingdismissed. 

 

A: I think that summer was the 
crucial summer -- no, he must have
 been told that he would be 
released before. The spring, right. And that™s  
-- he didn™t think he w
ould get a j ob and then 
towards the end another letter said that he was 
settling in Bialystok, but 
before that he tried 
through a rabbi who knew some body inAmsterdam 
to contact the Jewish community. As a 

musician he did have a professi
on where he didn™t  really need the language.  He could have 
settled some where but nothing came forth. 
 

Q: The summer of ™38 is when you .. 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Were you still in touch with the rest of the staff at Brezany? 

 

A: Ye s.  I went to Brezany in 1935, ™36, ™37 a
nd ™38 for my vacation. There was a railroad 
executive who my parents knew from Brezany 
and I would go with them. We  would go by 
train.  So that™s how I knew Brezany.  It was th
e fi rst time that I encount
ered boys and the stor y 
goes that anything that wore pant
s was an absolute object of awe 
on my part after the years of 
starvation. 
 

Q: You™re talking about after .. 

 

A: ---. And I™d go there and be able to ha ve at 
least walk counter-clockwise with the boys walking 
one way and we™d walk the other way.  It was 
known as the Curso. And then I would have big 
eyes -- anything Œ 
 

Q: Promenade? 

 
A: Promenade, yes.With this cousin of mi ne, and the other. 

 

Q: You were close to at least one cousin in Brezany?  

 

A: Ah, no. Thi s one and the one who™s older than I.
 Ve ry close.  I woul
d spend days with them; 
there was a gigantic, gigantic lake in Brezany wi
th a beautiful beach and early in the mornings, 

supplied with a big lunch, I would go walk with my
 cousins and all their friends to swi m, and I 
was an excellent swimmer. And that was Br
ezany.  I™d gain about 20 pounds and be all sun 

tanned and come  home  and my
 mother would say, ﬁOh, GodAl mi ghty, you look like a 
Ukrainian peasant™, and I would lose my very, 
very Mazurish, which is a very chopped Polish 
accent and speak with a very, very sort of like 
southern Polish accent, and was spoiled by my 
grandmother. 
 

Q: Your grandmother and grandfat
her were – how did she spoil you? 
 

A: I mean, she just allowed -- well, I was always
 chaperoned. The cousin who was my chaperon is 
now in Mexico.  I was only allowed to go (? ) in
 the evening, in the af
ternoon.  She spoiled me  
by feeding me  and there was no end to it, spoile
d me by ha ving time with me.  Scanty time with 
my mother and my father.  My mothe r  was ve
ry much involved with my father; ma ybe it was 
my fault.  I really wasn™t  a child who would 
go and converse very much, but there I was very 
giving and -- permissive people. 
 

Q: Grandmothe rIda. 

 

A: Ye s.  My grandmother Ida; the other one was dead. 
 
Q: Do you have a sense of what she was thinking
 during these years about 
the world and about the 
dangers that your father – 
 

A: No, it was never, it wasn™t  customary to sp
eak with children.  I never heard anything spoken 
other than my own parents who we
re discussing it at the dinner tabl
e.  Not there. They had no 
such thoughts. That was a different part of Po
land.  Here my father was actually threatened 
from two points of view. We  could see the bo
rder on a clear day. There was no question about 
it if the war started (?) would be
 occupied within half an hour. 
 

Q: How about relations between 
Jews and gentiles in Brezany?  
 

A: Bad.  Good with the Poles, because they themselves were a mi nority there. And they were of 
the higher class. The Ukrainians
 hated their guts, but nothing was 
ever done. You did not have 
to (? ). Oh, incidents, but I mean. The city wa
s, the town was largely Jewish with Ukra inians 
and Poles on the outskirts. A
nd now, my uncle the lawyer was 
handling gentiles exclusively 
because I know because they paid with chicke ns 
and geese and eggs. That was the lawyer ™s fee 
very often. 
 

Q: What was your cousin Sylvia doing– 

 

A: Oh, Sylvia, fist of all, was not only older in ye
ars, she was older, older.
  I was a child.  One of 
my cousins claime d that I was a real teenager 
because I was imitating her.  But Sylvia was a 

lady or a sort of some body to be admi red by the whole town.  She always walked with her 
mother.  I wa s being trained.  See, her mother 
was gathering her dowry.  I never even heard of 
it.  My parents were saving money for my me dic a l 
school.  It was a different kind of thing.  It 
was a little town, and there she was. 
 

Q: So Sylvia was planning on getti
ng married.  Did she have a fiancé? 
 

A: She had, yes, well, I was in the ghetto 
already. Yes, she did. Ye s, she did. 
 

Q: InBrezany?  

 

A: InBrezany,yes. 

 

Q: She finished her schooling? 

 

A: She did, no, she graduated before me . 

 

Q: But she finished her schooling with high school? 

 

A: Ye s, with a high school diploma.  In ™39, no ™ 41. No, it couldn™t , I, She graduated in ™39 and I 
graduated in ™41. 
 

Q: She graduated before the war began? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 
Q: Wa s she working or– 
 

A: Ye s, I was told that  she was working after th
at during Soviet times. And she had a fiancé who 
was a student in (?), really a fiancé, ‚cause
 I had a boyfriend, but nobody 
called him a fiancé. 
 

Q: No,no. 

 

A: It was just a ghetto friendsh
ip which, boy-girl explorations, 
which were the end of the world 
kind of thing. 
 

Q: So, Sylvia was planning on getting married and– 

 

A: In a proper way, with the two 
fa milies introduced and all that. 
 

Q: So, it wasn™t a childhood sweetheart? 

 

A: No, no. Somebody she met, yes. 

 

Q: FromLvov(?)? 

 

A: Lvov,yes. 

 

Q: And she was working during the time of the Russian occupation. 

 
A: She was.  Everybody was. You had to.  
You had to.  Unless you had some body who was 
incapacitated.  My mother really ha
d a very weak heart, angina a
nd so forth, so – not that they 
forced you but there wasn™t  enough to eat if you didn™t. 
 

Q: Yourgrandparents 
were still in Brezany? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: They were retired I would imagine by– 

 

A: My grandmother never worked
 but my grandfather was a reti
red person all through the Polish --
in between the Polish republics.  He 
was getting hisAustrian pension– 
 

Q: He was anAustrian civil servant? 

 

A: Ye s, yes. That™s  what he was. 

 

(END OF SI DEA)  

 

 I now recollect that during the Soviet times 
my father was sending mone y and I would put the 
two and two together knowing what I know about 
the Soviet Union that 
they probably did not 
honor the pensions.  Or did they?   I don™t know
, but somehow I™m under the impression that 
things were tough 
at that point. 
 

Q: Where were you and your fa mily when the war broke out? 
 
A: I was in Bialystok and during our graduati
on ball, came home, got to
 bed and suddenly the 
bomb was fl ying.  My father was at the airpor
t wa lking with the students when he saw the 
bombing of the airport, the Soviet airplane.  
And we had a Soviet offi
cer living in our house, 
one room was rented, and he walked out.  He sa
ys, ﬁOh what stupid guys, it must be maneuvers.  
They must have done some thing wrong.™  It wa
s one bomb.  I t  wasn™t  ma neuvers. Then we 

heard (?) announcing that 
they were invaded. 
 

Q: This was the Soviet invasion? 

 

A: That was the German invasion of the occupied 
territory of Poland. We  we re almost at the end 
of it, almost at the end of it– 
 

Q: So in September 1939 German troops ma rched into– 

 

A: September 1939 was their original–Oh, you™re talking about– 

 

Q: Yeah, that™s  what I was refe
rring to, when war broke out. Yea
h, you were in Bialystok when the 
war began in September 1939. 
 

A: ™39. The Polish-Soviet, the Polish-Ge rman war. 

 

Q: That™s right,yeah. 

 
A: We ll, that lasted a very short time . The Po
lish army suddenly was no longer there.  It was busy 
fighting the Soviet army, not the German ar my.  I t  was from both sides. 
 

Q: Bialystokreceivedsome
 visitations, did it not? 

 

A: Bialystok received a visitation. 
 Even before all of this there were some  Germans infiltrating 
there but it ha d the Germans in for a week.  
I believe that the fighting took ma ybe a week, 
certainly not more. And in September, whenev
er theYom Kippur, the Rosh Hashanah came, 
they were already there, for a week.Yeah.  
But this was the beginning of the whole thing, you 
know. The final solution was yet postponed. Th
at was the beginning.  I don™t know how they 
worked it in Poland proper. They were killing 
people but weren™t as organized; it wasn™t  yet a 
conveyer belt operation.  So I can™t  think of any at
rocities of that time.  It was a week of 
intimidations, I would say. They would come  ov
er to a Jew with a beard and smack him and do 
things like that, nothi
ng beyond this, but they were promising it to us. 
 

Q: In what way? 

 

A: They were. I overheard them talking, that with
in a week they were going to become  much less 
gentlema nly.And we expected it. We  already 
knew what they were capable of doing because 
they™ve done it to German Jews. Yes, I was aw
are of Germa n Jews being, for mer Polish Jews, 
who lived in Germany, being thrown back to 
Poland, and what they were doing, the euthanasia 
programs and the concentration camp of Buchen
wald existed. The German Socialists and 
Communists were being persecute
d and German J e ws.  Kristallnacht.All this was already 
known.  So we at that point knew what to expect
, and I was on breadlines when they said that 
onYo m Kippur they were going to 
celebrate that holiday pr operly. 
 

Q: The Germans would? 

 

A: The Jews would. The Germans were (? ) a gi rl standing, you will read this, and I came home, I 
said, and told my parents about it. 
 

Q: The Germans were saying that the Jews--- 

 

A: That the Je ws -- don™t worry about the Jews. We  
will, we know what to do with them.  But they 
already, within a day or two they were rem
oving their belongings, th
eir telephone lines and 
everything, leaving us. And the Soviets came in
 and were greeted with flowers and songs, by 
all but the Poles. They did not trust them. 
 

Q: We ll, their country had been invaded. 

 

A: And vice-versa. The Russians, this is why, this
 is why, not that they so very much loved the 
Jews. They were the only ones who they could tr
ust. They had nothing against the Soviets, the 
Jews.  Here they came and liberated them 
from Germans. Anybody would be a hero, and 
certainly they were. And the 
capitalists were the only ones w
ho knew, but didn™t know to what 
extent they would be persecuted. Yes, everybody
 knew about the purges in the Soviet Union.  I 
didn™t, but the older people did. 
 

Q: So the Jews of Bialystok were glad to see the Russians come  in? 

 
A: No question about it. 

 

Q: And how was the German evacuation– 

 

A: The German evacuation was very curious.  I 
didn™t see that part, but I did see, while the 
Germans we re moving, at the same  time in one such street, I saw a contingent of Jews with a 

red flag.  Now can you imagine Nazis and the re
d flag?  You can only do that brazenly when 
you know that this will be done with impunity. A
nd that™s  what they were counting on and of 
course the Germans weren™t 
doing anything at that point. 
 

Q: The Jews were waving red flags– 

 

A: And throwing things at them. 

 

Q: Throwing things at them? 

 

A: Eggs and stuff. 

 

Q: Throwing eggs at the Germans? 

 

A: And they made a note and they came and kne
w about Bialystok already, knew where it came  
from, from the Jewish sector. 
 

Q: So the period of the Russian occupation 
was a relatively safe period for your fa mily? 
 
A: To the non-capitalists.  By capitalists I™m si mply
 talking about very rich people, or people who 
were in some way intimidating workers, and th
ere were such always.And, oh, no, politically  
involved people, Polish officers, policemen, not fa
natical Zi onists, all lead
ers, all leaders were 
in trouble.  
 
Q: How did the Russians treat your father, who afte
r all had been an officer in the Polish army?  

 

A: They didn™t know that. 

 

Q: Theydidn™tknow? 

 

A: No.  My father hid his army booklet.  I don™t th
ink he burned it because he felt ma ybe he™d have 
to use it some day, but he hid it and he told th
em he didn™t have it. You had to give up our 
military and your Polish passport to get a Soviet 
pa ssport.  We  became a Soviet Byelorussia, 

Byeloruss now. And he hid it and they disbe
lieve d that. You don™t lose a military booklet, 
whatever it was, or any document. You don™t tr
avel, you don™t go shopping with it for sure, but 
he wouldn™t give it, so they called me . The KVD 
requested my presence.  Mother was scared to 
testify against my father but I knew better. At
 that point I certainly 
never would have been 
politicized against my fa ther personally, but I wa
sn™t  even politicized against, for them, or 
against Zionism. This was not 
yet, they hadn™t reached me  and all I knew was that my father 
was in trouble. Wa s he a n officer?   I don™t know. 
Wa s he in the army?   I think so, but I don™t 
know.  Have you ever seen any booklet?   I haven™t 
seen any of his papers. That™s how it went, 
hour after hour. The only time I knew what it was 
like was when we had the hearings ofAnita 

Hill. You reme mber Specter? 
 
Q: Ye s. 

 

A: That™s  how I was interrogated. And I wrote a 
letter to Specter and told him that. That was a 
shame ful performa nce. This way you can get almost any ﬁtruthﬂ that you wish to get, and that™s  

how, but they didn™t break me  down. 
 

Q: Did they interrogate your mother? 

 

A: No.They knew that if they 
ever going to get some
thing it would be throu
gh the kids. The bad 
guy and the good guy. You know that routine. 
 

Q: Wa s your father able to c
ontinue working as a teacher? 
 

A: He was not only able to, because he really ha
d a very good story to tell, that he was in the 
Soviet Union during the Revoluti
on, that he certainly wasn™t  si
ding with theWhites, and why 
should he have?   He was just anAustrian soldier, that he, that they ma de him a commis sar of 

something the month or two that he was there. But he was also just  a musician, just  a teacher, 

and that™s  what was called (? ). You were betw
een the working people and the peasants.  So, so 

long as you weren™t tied in with th
e capitalists, you were a safe soci
al class and they (?)  He was 
very well regarded and he did know Russia.  He 
still reme mb ered enough.  So he worked very, 
very hard.  He was involved w
ith the (? ) which was sort of 
the children of the schools were 
creative in all kinds of 
musical and dance ways and they had 
Olympiads to that effect and he 
was going to Minsk and to Moscow with his chor
al groups.  He worked in high schools.  He 
was working very hard, very ti
red, but he surely liked it. 
 

Q: This was a good time for  you as well as for him.  

 

A: For me  it was a grand time.  I was allowed to
 stay up late. The school wa s a second session.  I 
would be there in the evening. Boys were co
mi ng fromWa rsaw, you know, the refugees were 
comi ng and I met some very nice, 
interesting people, and that was the time that I actually met 
with true Communists for the first time. Thos
e were people who were imprisoned in Poland.  
The Polish Communist Part
y was illegal.  Some  people sat in
 prison ‚till the Soviets came .  
Their daughters and sons were different than we
 were. They really and truly believed in 

Marxism. And they were also ni
ce people; all they said was very
 plausi bl e, ethi cal, and I was 
very impressed with it.  Little did I k
now what else was behind, that I didn™t . 
 

Q: So you™re a high school student at
 a school that is now a Russian? 
 

A: It became  a Russian school. A
nd at first it looked as if I was 
going to be in trouble because very 
childishly and naively when we had our electioneering, I told them, thinking that I™m doing 

something great, I said, ﬁI was a 
left wing Zionist!ﬂ  Little did 
I know that it was a dirty word.  
You don™t ever, you can be all left wing you want
, you™re still a nationalist, you™re still a 
Zionist, that™s  a nationalist.We  don™t believe that
. Marxist is not even 
a second international -- 
you know.  It™s a –  
 

Q: That™s  purging the party. 

 

A: It would have been just as bad if I told them th
at --  worse, if I told th
em I was aTr otskyite and 
just as bad if I told them I was a Buden me mb
er. This was Hashomer Hatzayir (? ) in 1939, I 
was a gymnast in their camp. To that exte
nt I was a Zionist, so I pronounced it proudly. 
 
Q: How did Brezany fare under the Russian 
occupation?  We re there any changes? 
 

A: No.  I would surmise that all of
 the towns that I know had about the same  fare, and that is influx 
of Soviets, we called them (? ),
 or the (? ), eastern people woul
d come .  First we poked fun of 
them. They didn™t know how to dress (? ). All 
the institutions will become (? ) but it became 
Ukraine. 
 

Q: Yes, there is a difference. 

 

A: Ye s, but you don™t run pogroms at a time that they are trying to pronounce themselves 
Internationalists.  In our cas
e I™m telling you this is the tr
uth and everybody would corroborate 
that a person who was sitting in a dentist™s of
fice went ahead of a Jewish patient and that  
Jewish patient said, ﬁThat™s an anti-Se miteﬂ he 
had to serve in prison a 
day or two at least. 
 

Q: That™s  under the Russians? 

 

A: Ye s. They were very, very correct. They 
were trying to force my school to become  aYi ddish-
speaking school, saying ﬁAren™t you ashame d 
to speak Polish with all the Polish anti-
Se mitism? ﬂ  It was a whole different ball game .  
They were conducting, they had a university in 
Yi ddish in (?) They had aYi ddish library in
 Bi alystok. All the songs, everything was in 
Yi ddish. They promoted, not Hebrew, not Zion, 
butYi ddish. That™s  what was happening, and 
the same  thing was happening there except ther
e it wasn™tYi ddish, it was maybe Ukrainian. 
 

Q: The Russians were calling the shots. The Ukrainians are not Œ 

 

A: The (? ) Ukrainians. 

 

Q: Yeah.  Keeping in mi nd the relations between 
the Ukrainians and Poles, the Ukrainians and 
Jews -- 
 

A: Ukrainianshatedthe 
Soviets to begin with. 
 

Q: Uhhu m.  

 

A: I don™t think the Russians trusted 
the Ukrainians as much as they
 trusted the Jews, for a simple 
reason. Wh at could the Jews 
do but be obedient citizens? 
 

Q: So the union of Polish Ukraine with the Uk
rainian republic is more nominal than real. 
 

A: Nomi nal.  It became a Sovi
et Ukraine.  So did ours. 

 

Q: Now, where were you when the Germans attack
ed the Soviet Union and come  to Bialystok? 
 

A: I was (? ) that I was home. That was the day,
 the year of my gradua
ting from the Soviet tenth 
year of school, in lieu of the 
lycee of science which I was really part of, and that was June 21
st
, I 

think, 22
nd
 perhaps, 22
nd
. And on the night of the 21
st
 and the day of the 21
st
 we had our 
graduation ball in school.  I came home very late; th
at was also my first kiss with a boy, which I 
won™t forget. And that early morning they bombed some thing in the city, I don™t -- forget -- a 
house.  One house, and we thought, and so did th
e Soviet officer in our house that this was 

some  mi sha p with the ma neuvers, but they didn™t know that they were attacked. 
 

Q: So it was a bi g surprise? 

 

A: Oh, absolutely.  I saw soldiers comi ng out
 in their underwear to
 get to their units. 

 

Q: Nobody that you knew even suspected or 
talked about the pos
sibility that -- 
 

A: Ye s. There was a talk that they ha d seen Ge
rmans, that they had s
een strange people walking 
around pointing to the pictures of St
alin, Molotov, (? ), etc., etc. ﬁThat™s not going to be here the 
day after --ﬁ and the date was given. 
 

Q: You were very close to the German frontier.     

 

A: They infiltrated, we were told, with the refugees
 yet. You see, the Jewish refugees were comi ng 
in 1940, winter of 1940. They opened the borders.They knew what was going to happen to 

Jews, and allowed them in. They took so ma ny 
a nd no more; then they closed it and I am told 
that that was one danger, that they 
got Germans and then they did try. 
 

Q: What happened during this
 second German occ upation? 
 

A: We ll, that second Germa n occupation was the re
al McCoy. They™ve already had two years with 
Poland, so they already started the annihilation of
 Jews.  So obviously they were just going to 
take up to this point (?), wh
ich they did. They burned the 
Jewish sector; they burned the 
people.  They took people who had, theThursd
ay people or the Friday people, they would 
round up by profession, by age, me n, only, and pur
portedly took them to work. They me ntioned 

that they went to work.  Later 
when it was discovered that they
 were then killed (?) but they 
used them for a while. 
 

Q: This was imme diately after -- 

 

A: This was for about a mo nth.  No, it was more th
an a month, it was the summer and into the fall.  
Then in October, I believe, of that year, wh
ich wa s in 1941, they constructed the Bialystok 
ghetto.They walled in a section of
 town and my family had to move in. We  were given one 

portion of a room, a specific amount of cubic me t e rs
 per person.  It formed a (? ) like this, about 
the cubic me ters, three cubic meters. 
 

Q: Your fa mily had lived outside of the ghetto  before this time. Wa s it a mi xed neighborhood? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And how wa s the ghetto run?   Di
d your father continue to teach? 
 

A: Oh, no. The r e were no schools.  Schools we
re absolutely forbidden. The only schools -- no, 
Jews were not to be trained, not in the academ
ics. They would only attend ORT schools; you 

know, like the Jewish ORT. Those were artisan 
schools. (?)We  ran our own schools.  I ran a 
little school for little ki ds.  High school graduate
s would do that because most of our teachers, 
professors we  called them, were killed. Ve ry -- 
 
Q: Yourfather? 

 

A: My father, no. They never got to him.  He was 
just in the ghetto and at
 first he worked in a -- 
uh -- he worked in some  kind of a factory,I believe a furniture f
actory or some thing. 
 

Q: So he™s no longer a mus i c -- 

 

A: Oh, no, no.  In fact, all of his music was up on th
e roof, under the roof (?) but my father at first 
worked there and then this didn™t shield hi m.  
That first action which happened was in February 
or January in ™43, February, I think, yup. 
 

Q: A year and a half later. 

 

A: Ye s. And he was in danger. We  hid in the 
Yudenrap (? ) the Jewish community because of my 
uncle who worked there 
 

A: So you had an uncle who worked for the Jewish council? 

 

A: He, yeah, he was some thing -- a mi nor official.  
And he coaxed my father to become something.  
They didn™t have an opening there, but they di
d have an opening for a scribe in the Jewish 
police, the militia, and as they booked the scribe
s, it was a totally benevolent non-malignant 
type of an institution, because there was no reason for it. There was no crime. 
 

Q: So your father was a scribe? 

 

A: Yeah.  He was sitting in the -- 
they called it the Revere.  It was 
an all-officer thing, the militia.  
And as such, he was getting a daily soup (? ) it 
was just a little bit 
easier. And we sold 
everything we had, little by little. You had to
 smuggle going through the ghetto walls all the 
time. 
 

Q: Food was being rationed? 

   

A: We ll, we all lost weight , but uh --  halfway decent. 

 

Q: Did you have to wear a yellow star? 

 

A: Ye s.We  had to wear a yellow star right away.  
I didn™t.  I had anAryan look.  Uh-uhh.  I went to 
villages and sold things and brought food 
home .  Before the ghetto.  Oh, yeah. 
 

Q: Your mother and father
 did wear yellow stars? 
 

A: Yeah.  They stuck at home .  But I didn™t. 
 I took a chance. Very -- I didn™t  mi nd taking a 
chance.  Should™ve coul d™ ve taken more of a chan
ce but didn™t.  Could™ve 
gotten actual papers.  
When I was going to the Soviet 
Union trying, at first the army. 
What happened was when the 
Germans attacked us, the Soviets were foldi
ng every office and moving and the trucks were 

moving, and the cars were moving and fa milie
s, Soviet families, they were removing 
themselves. The army was removing themselves. They came to my father and said, 
ﬁTovarishka (? )!ﬂ means come  with us.  Pleas
e come  with us, you know what happens.ﬂAnd 
my father answered, my father told me  you don™
t move anywhere during the war; I™m staying 
here. And when I heard that, I had two more 
friends and we were walking around I said ﬁThis 
ain™t good; let™s get out of here. They™re going to
 come  here any day and there we go.ﬂ All 
Bialystok wa s moving on foot. With rucksacks th
ey were moving, especially those who were in 
some  way involved, whether they worked for the S
oviets. Who would have asked them id they 
were truly Marxists?   It was anot
her thing -- it was put in a ma
nagerial position to call him a 
Communist.  It was bad e
nough to be a Jew, but to be called 
a Communis t  Jew, that was in the 
end, so somebody like myself and they would call me  
everything else, I just didn™t  even want to 
take a chance, and besides I knew what was going 
to happen, so we ma rched in order to cross 
the front line.  I was going by foot, didn™t get too far, and we came back 
 

Q: Overtaken by the Germans Œ 

 

A: I -- we stayed -- we stopped when we knew th
at they were ahead of us and then we were 
overtaken. Ye s. 
 

Q: That™s interesting that you w
ould seek to flee, you who are in
 less than immediate danger than 
say, your parents, who were obvi
ously, your father was a leader
 of the community and clearly 
Jewish. 
 

A: No, they wouldn™t have gone.  My father was,
 because there plenty of
 such, who were on the 
road.  I went with my friend™s parents who were 
his age, but that was the nature of my  father 
and my mother, and I wa s afraid of my mother. 
 

Q: Your experience suggests that if they had 
tried to leave they w
ouldn™t have gotten -- 
 

A: No, no. The y would have come  back; the trains
 were demolished.  Even if my father were -- 
the trucks were demolished.  I mean they were
 bombarding us.  I woul
d go -- planes would 
come .  I would go to a little forest; I™d wake up 
-- there was no wood.  Now that™s  what I was 
trying to say -- and so ma ny dead people, and some
 of the m Christians.  
I certainly could have 
gotten some body else™s  papers, easily.  Just the bi
rth certificate would have sufficed, in my case, 
my age. 
 

Q: Do you know what was going on in Brezany during these mo nths? 

 

A: We  knew that the same  thing was happening. Th
e ghetto was for med. And it was true of all the 
little towns and some of the towns were completely demolished but Brezany was in existence.  

That we knew.  Some  of the people in the smalle
r towns, their Jewish populations were partially 
shot and they were removed to a larger town.  
They were consolidating the Jews into specific 
centers to await the final solution. The 
planners had that in view all along. 
 

Q: We re you in touch -- were you and your fa mily in
 touch with other me mb ers of your family in 
Brezany during -- 
 

A: Ye s. We ll, yes.  I reme mber one letter clearly.
  I have a feeling there ma y have been one before 
that. And we had family in another part of s
outhern Poland in the Carpathian Mountains.  I had 

an aunt who was a dentist and a younger aunt -- 
my mother ™s fa mily, and we were not only in 
contact with them but my sister was there. A
nd it was my sister who was hidden by my aunt for 
whomAryan papers, a bi rth certific
ate of a deceased gentile Christian child. These pa pers were 
bought and she was taken by a guide to another part
 of Poland, given to a Christian family who 
were told that she™s the daughter of Polish of
ficers who were executed by the Russians. And 
subsequent to that I discovered 
that she was christened by the guide, now that he didn™t tell my 
aunt.  It was just a ma tter of her giving him a 
certain amount of gold, dental gold, I suppose, and 
some thing, and that™s how my sister became Ch
ristian, and she was on her way intercepted by a 
German officer who said ﬁYude!ﬂ to her, b
ecause she looks ve ry Jewish.  She became  
frightened. The guide told him, ﬁOH, no, no, no, 
no, no -- I mean here are the papers, blah, blah 
---ﬁ She ran out and locked herself up in a bathro
om, refused to leave.  It was a tough time.  
When she got out, when she got out, she tells me
 she wanted to have nothing to do with it -- 
with her Jewi shness, and she sat in front of St
. Mary™s  picture and said ﬁNow, I don™t know if 
you™re really there, or if you were, but I prom
ise you, if you save me , I™
ll stick to you.™And she 
did.  
 

Q: She was saved? 

 

A: She felt she was saved as a Christian. 

 

Q: She survived the war in your aunt™s  town? 

 

A: She survived -- no, she survived not in my aunt
™s  town --where she was taken to that Christian 
fa mily.  I went back to Poland in 1945 -- ™
44 -- ™45, and I came to her high school, and she 

walked out.  She recognized me  and she said, ﬁWhere™s my mother?ﬂ That™s how she greeted 

me . And aft e r that, the next day she went to mass to expiate the sins of our parents who killed 
Christ. And that™s  when I said to my self, ﬁI live
d as a Jew, not very Jewish, I suffered as a Jew 
as the rest of them, I™ m going to die as oneﬂ, and I stayed for a while and I left for Germany.  
And that™s another fancy story.  I told you I 
became a British subject by bi rth to get out. 
 

Q: Now, a few mome nts ago you said that you reca
lled one letter from your  relatives in Brezany. 
 

A: Ye s.  My boyfriend, my first love, the one in
 Bialystok -- no, no, that was a boy in high school, 
in (? ).  No, this was another, it was an older 
boy.  He was already a year
 o two older than I and 
he wasn™t  from Bialystok; he was from Lieder, 
and he came to our house and he wanted to have 
a connection with the underground and some bod
y told him if there was anybody who knows it 
would be (? ) and they brought him to my house. 
And indeed I had a connection, but at first I 

had to get to know hi m.  So I di
d get to know him. We  fell in love and both of us fell in love 
and he stayed in our house.  My parents were 
-- because hi s pa rents were -- his mother and 

brother were shot in front of his eyes, and aLithuanian guard knew him fr om the school and 

pulled hi m out and started -- he didn™t  look Je
wish -- he says, ﬁ What are you doing here?ﬂ -- 
and got him out, so he was saved.   Shot badly.  
So that news that this is a boy who lived in our 
house and was my boyfriend, that became  the big 
story that wanted to
 travel some how to 
Brezany and the letter came , ‚Huh, you have a boyf
riend; he must be very rich -- who has 
boyfriends nowadays?   Must be lots of money.
ﬂ  Little did they know
 that he was on my 
parents™ keep with no place to go.  
 

Q: Who did this letter come  from?  

 

A: Mycousin,surely. 
 

Q: Was it Sylvia? 

 

A: It must have been my gr andma.  She  was likely to
 be the acidulous type of 
(? ).  It wasn™t  usual -
- it was -- the story went, ﬁIt™s in the ghett
o, you became engaged or you married, it was for 
money.ﬂ Younger girls ma rry older guys who ha
ve some  s muggling -- you know, money from 
here, there or some wher e else.  But the tr
uth was that very many young kids like mys e lf 
acquired live-in boyfriends because 
we all felt, and I wrote music w
ith him, that the world is in 
flames, and we are spinni ng in that ship on that 
ocean of foam and wrath and, let™s be together, 

let™s see what  it is like.  
 

Q: Live for toda y because there ma y not be a tomorrow. 

 

A: That™s right
, that™s  right. 
 

Q: What else we re you doing during these months? 

 

A: In the ghetto? 

 

A: Yes. What -- 

 

A: We ll, you have my story of the involveme nt
 with the underground.  I me t with the underground 
through English lessons.You know that. 
 

Q: So you were taking English le
ssons because the underground -- 
 
A: I suspect, I suspect it was a boy that had some
thing to do with some thing and he inasmuch as 
admitted -- I knew him from (?), he was fr om Bi
alystok and we decided let™s continue those 
lessons. I was going to drop it already,
 but he said, ﬁLet™s  continue 
those lessons. That will be a 
good way for us to talk.ﬂ And he involved me  a
nd it was decided that because my father was a 

policeman this house wa sn™t  likely to be sear
ched, so under my ma ttre
ss there was some  old 
Russian ma gnum (? ), a long thing, you know, -- a pi
stol, a very long pistol and a couple of 

grenades and literature also. 
 

Q: Where did these come  fr om? 

 

A: From the left wing underground.  I was associat
ed with a left underground which meant it was 
all the way from Communists 
to Zionists -- left wing. 
 

Q: So, the Jewish underground? 

 

A: Oh, yes, exclusively Jewi sh. And -- so that wa
s part of it.  But I would occasionally meet one 
person, all I knew, his name  was Beryl, and thathe was telling me  that I would go to the woods 

when the time comes. When the time ca me I 
did go, but not very far because it was decided 
they wouldn™t  waste the weapons on an inexpe
rienced girl, having so ma ny boys who could do 
it, or girls who could do it -- whatever it was 
-- I wasn™t  quite what I mi ght do. I tried to 
convince them that I could pass for gentile and 
I can easily get money, I mean food, I can, I am 
experienced.  I was led to believe we don™t do it 
that way.We ™ll go in with our guns and force 

them to give food which was absolutely (?).  
And besides, they said, 
you are the spiritual kind 
of person, you write music -- I wrote some  part 
of the songs -- you go to the ghetto and be in 
charge of our propaganda to get more and more people.  So I, from the sort of a way station, 
went back.That was my first and only encounter, because the second time that there was a 

chance to go out I was in love with a boy and not 
ready to leave this -- that was that time  -- and 
so we were caught.  
 

Q: You were caught -- 

 

A: In the ghetto. And we discovered the night 
we did have some body in our headquarters who was 
a Gestapo Communist. 
 

Q: You mean within the --  within -- 

 

A: Gestapo.  He was our contact with the Gesta
po.  He knew the ghetto would be liquidated within 
a day. Apparently, he did know -- some how we 
knew that it was going to happen, that they™ve 
already brought Ukrainians and 
Lithuanians in and they™re surr
ounded.  Now that this happened 
we had a dichotomy of philosophy. The older pe
ople said, ﬁLet™s  all perish fighting and write 
history.ﬂ And we said, ﬁThe hell with history.  
Let™s not peri sh; let™s get out and hibernate in the 
woods and save the cream of the nation.  Give 
us your arms.ﬂ And so for a while, we didn™t 
wasn™t  to stay in the ghetto and that™s why 
the young were going, the older were thinking of (? ) 
occasiona lly, Parisian commune style of showing 
this was a left-wing division.  But the same  

was happening with the revisionists and the right
 wing also; they were 
talking about (?).  
 

Q: When was this now? 

 
A: This was ™43 because we  had the first action in
 February and after that we knew that we were 
doome d. We  thought at first we 
were designed to survive; we 
were going to be the museum 
piece. No, we weren™t. The final solution -- we
 were going to be -- a
nd we already knew about 
Tr eblinka because people were comi ng back and 
telling.  So we knew there was no hope.  So 
that™s  the time , on that night before the fi nal solution and that had to be September 4
th
 or 5
th
, one 
of those because my birthday is September 6
th
 and I was already on -- waiting for the train.We  
staged, we had it in plan, but now the orders 
were given.  So I was given an order in the 
morning to go in such and such a place with 
a gr enade and wait for the tank and the tank was 
going to come  and I wa s told where it was going to come , only I didn™t know how to use that 

grenade, and I™d seen enough cowboy movies and 
such type movies where I knew you had to 
pull some thing with your teeth, but which part, an
d what do you do with it?  And so I went there 
and they were firing; we had guns -- it was an 
uprising. We  were -- I don™t know what they 
were shooting. They were shooting Germans or  
Ukrainians or some thing and I was supposed to 
stand there and wait for the tank.The tank neve
r came, but an old German came -- a wee old 
We hr macht who was not involved with the Ukrainia
ns, but he was truly helping people settle 
down on their ma rch towards the train where they 
were going to be taken, because they were 
wearing kid gloves with us. A
ll alone, nobody was shot at that point. That was one of the 
gimmicks.  ﬁOh come  on, you know you™re not going 
to die. You know that you™ve worked for 
the Germans. You are working contingents. You™re
 all going to work.  Just behave.  Make sure 
that your luggage is well labeled and --ﬁ 
 

Q: So you were being resettled? 

 

A: So that German intercepted me  and because I wa
s still looking at that grenade he assume d that I 
picked it up from the me n who were lined up some where behind these things. And he says, ﬁ(?) 
Leave it, don™t touch it, and give it to me .  Or
 put it down.ﬂAnd he picked it up and, ﬁ Where are 
your parent s? ﬂ And took me over -- was totally
 be wildered. A little bit later my boyfr i end 
came. He sa ys, ﬁThat™s a lost cause.ﬂ  He was s
hooting (?).  It was a lo
st -- we didn™t, weren™t 
even organized as well as they were,Wa rsaw gh
etto.  But it lasted. We  burned up that whole 
ghetto.  I™m told after we were 
taken away there was still shooti
ng. They had barricades.They 
died to the last person. There we
re more people like myself who went
 off or were directed off.  
Girls, not boys. 
 

Q: How ma ny would you es
timate were involved? 
 

A: In the underground? 

 

Q: Ye s, and in the uprising. 

 

A: I have no -- that you would have to check record
s.  Because all I could se
e that one little piece, 
that one little street, I never 
knew the leader, any second names.
  I knew one face, one ma n and 
suspected another, so if I wa
s caught I could be tortured to
 death, I had nobody to tell on. 
 

Q: Did your parents know what you were up to? 

 

A: My mother discovered in the concentration camp 
and all she could say, ﬁOh, is that what you™re 
to us? ﬂ 
 

Q: This is after she was in the concentration camp? 
 
A: ﬁThat™s what you were doing to us. 
You could have had us all killed!ﬂ 
 

Q: And what were your parents doing? 

 

A: My mother was working in a sewing factory, 
making a uniforms or parts of it, some thing like 
this.  My father was, I told you, a scribe in th
e militia, and I at that point was made into a 
gardener. We  were raising our own vegetables 
and in the militia gard
en. So me how he got me  

released from work, my father, but my ma in 
job in the last few months was teaching younger 
children.  I opened little schools. The boss gave 
me  a couple of dollars, vlatiks, whatever, and it 
gave me , I apparently was born a teacher, the pl
easure of facing a child and saying ﬁYou™ve got 
to know Latin and Physics, absolutely and there 
it is. Without that you will never be accepted 
to the school.ﬂ And the little 
child translated it into, ﬁI™m goi
ng to live!ﬂ  So I credit myself 
with able to do that more than anything else; th
is was the greatest amount 
of passive resistance.  
Of course, none of these children survive
d.  Nobody very mu ch younger than I survived 

because then they were classi fied as children. 
 Eleven, ten, some  tall, twelve, thirteen, okay. 
 

Q: We re your parents rounded up at this time? 

 

A: They went. We  were given an order -- you had 
a choice. You either stayed in your apartment to 
be clubbed to death or to be ki
lled there and my friend™s parents chose this. Or you had to line 
up -- you were given the hour, the placement to 
bring your knapsack and label it, all that. 
 

Q: We re you with your parents or with your boyfriend? 
 

A: No, I was with my boyfriend.  I was told -- my 
parents left and we said we were going after 
you. They didn™t know. We  didn™t. We
 went where we we
re supposed to go. 
 

Q: So your paths did not cross? 

 

A: No, no, no.  Then the Germans brought me  to th
em, my mot her said,ﬁWhe
re have you been? ﬂ   
I didn™t tell her. Then I saw 
another girl who also came.  I 
was disheveled, without anything, 
you know. 
 

Q: What were you able to take with you? 

 

A: Must have been the best that we had.A skirt 
and a sweater, cold -- some  shoes, possibly soap, I 
would say.  Food, ma ybe some  bread. 
 

Q: Where were you taken? 

 

A: We  were taken by train toTr eblinka, which was 
not even a retaining camp , just pure and simple 
extermination. You were driven in, exterminated
.  So we passed the field of ashes and huma n 
bones, and they were totally unabashed. We  saw 
it. And it wa s at that point, and there were 
ma ny train, that we started to sing all kind of 
songs, among them, ﬁThe In
ternationalﬂ and they 
were shooting onto the train becau
se there were some  left-wi
ng and some  Zionists -- and we 
were singing all kinds of songs and that was th
e song of our revolt, and they shot me  between 
my thighs and I was scraped by the bullet. 
 
Q: You were grazed by the bullet which was 
shot through -- you were in a cattle car -- 
 
A: Ye s, yes, and so we decided to jump. We  
were nearing the point before we went to that 
Tr eblinka. We  knew where we were going. We  -- 
there were some people -- at that point I 
realized there were more people in the 
underground, even the other factions, you know, 
whoever they were, and they were, uh -- I cut 
my  skirt -- there were 
no slacks worn in those 
days, and we were going to jump through the window and we saw people who were jump  -- 
 

Q: Through the window in the cattle car? 

 

A: Ye s, you could. You would push -- you could. 

 

Q: No window, but the opening? 

 

A: The opening. The opening. That was big enough
 to be pushed through and we saw -- I mean --
to let you know that you c
ould -- see, we™ve seen bodies. We ™ ve 
seen.  I™ll never forget the jazz 
musician whose song I carry in my heart and nob
ody to write it down, and he was shot in front 
of me .  He j u mped. 
 

Q: As he was jumping, he was shot? 

 

A: Ye s, and then he didn™t move, and I never heard of
 hi m.  Never.  So he was killed. And we still 
decided we will take a chance.  But there was not -- we didn™t have anything with us. We  didn™t 

have weapons, we didn™t have anything.  So we
 asked people, ﬁPlease give us your money.ﬂ 
 
Q: So you got out of the car successfully? 

 

A: No, no. We  were standing in the car and we™re
 asking people who were si
tting there praying to 
God, ﬁNever mi nd your prayers. We  are your hope. 
 If we survive, that nation will live. We  
can™t; we need your money.ﬂ 
 

Q: Oh, okay, cause I -- 

 

A: We  knew.  Some body said, ﬁOh, this one, this is 
rich so-and-so.ﬂ Their answer was, ﬁWe need 
that money to buy ourselves out.™ And besides Œ 
 

Q: This was still in the cattle car? 

 

A: Ye s. And then some body said, ﬁIf you dare to
 come close to that wi
ndow we™re going to call 
the Ukrainian, because if you jump, t hey™re going 
to shoot through the car.ﬂ  So, we said the 

hell with it. At that point (End ofTa
pe 1).  I didn™t  mi nd taking a chance. 
 

Q: So we™re outsideTr eblinka in the rail car? 

 

A: That™s  how we crossed toTr eblinka after the 
shooting I already had a sore and the reason which 
I so well reme mber the scene because with me
 were my high school friends whose name s I 
know.  I know how they perished. Ye s. And 
I know how they perished. And because my 

mother fa inted. 
 
Q: Your parents were in the same  car? 
 

A: Ye s.  I joined them with that German and I we
nt with them and I ma naged to pass the selection.  
Many parents were sent off and 
the train stopped inTr eblinka a
nd the last two wagons or three 
wagons were detached and these people went direc
tly to the annihilator. 
 But my parents passed 
their original inspection and were with us young 
people in the same  wagon.  My mot her fainted 
and she couldn™t even go down because it was so 
crowded. This was the fi rst time that I opened 
my big mouth to my father.  Normally had I done 
this he would have let me  have it.  I me an 
physically.  I said, ﬁGod damn it, would you ge
t off your you-know-what and help your wife.  
She™s fainted.ﬂ And wild-eyed, he looked at me  as
 if he was from a different world, and that™s 

when I recognized that that™s the end of the bi
g father of mi ne and the beginning of me , the 
leader of that family.  I™ve done this all along, 
supported them, got food for them, gave them the 
money that I earned.  I was the undertaking kind 
of a person but now I knew if there was any 
decisi on to be  ma de, it would have to be me  because he™s just not there. 
 

Q: This was a di fferent world? 

 

A: This was a different world, and I had to live up to
 it, so I went  to my 
mother and I said, and I 
shook her, and I said, ﬁNo, you live. You will live.  Now you stop it.ﬂ  She said, ﬁWhy did you 

do it?   Why did you wake me  up?   I could have
 died.™  I said, ﬁYou don™t know yet.ﬂAnd for 
some  reason at that point when I knew I couldn™
t -- we passed the point. Tr eblinka was much 
too far from wherever we  could go, some body told
 us where the point was. There were ma ny 
more people.  I never knew how ma ny -- 

 
Q: Who were to escape? 

 

A: Who were to escape -- oh, my boyfriend knew. 
 See, my boyfriend was taken with the fi rst 
action, the one that was in February, and he jump ed 
the train; that first tr
ain in February, and he 
stayed with far mers and he came back home  to 
me.  So he knew the point of -- where you could 
go to, uh, where there wa s Jewish underground. Th
ere was no point going anywhere especially 
not where there was a Polish underground. You had to go where we knew we had hiding 

places. The underground amounted to hiding pla
ces. We  did a little sabotage, but it was 
basically survival. We ll, at that point, we sai
d, well, let come  whatever ma y, and once it passed 
Tr eblinka, we started believing, ye
s, that we are going to work. 
 

Q: You™re in the cars that we re not 
left there, so the train continued? 
 

A: That™s right. 
And at that point. 
 

Q: And your family is still together? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Friends ar e still with you? 

 

A: Ye s.And we  were taken to Lublin.  Katzov Lubli
n.  It™s  known as (? ).  
And that is the fi rst time 
that I realized that they anni
hilate people in the way they sa
id, because I saw cans of Zyklon B 
gas right in fr ont of me  -- a pile. (? ). 
 
Q: We re you the only one to see this? 
 

A: No, we all saw it. And we also had children 
removed from their parent
s and taken to the place 
in front of which was the Zyklon B gas, scream
ing mothers, mothers trying to go with children 
and some  of us screaming, ﬁNo, you can have othe
r children!  For the na
tion.ﬂ We  didn™t let 
them. Some went, some stayed. We were sepa
rated from them in that Zukplaza (?) which was 
in Lublin depot and my friends volunteered them
selves.  Call went for young ladies to work in 
such and such a factory and all the wome n starte
d beautifying themselves with the kerchiefs.  
Some thing told me , ﬁDon™t  do that.ﬂ We ll, t
hose friends of mine went and never came back. 
That was one other ploy.  See, they didn™t have 
a full capacity for all these exterminations. We 
had such a big transport.  So they mi nimi zed it.  
They used all kinds of things. They would take 
you part way in the train and gas -- CO -- carbon 
monoxide or whatever 
in the train or an 
exhaust or shot them. 
 

Q: When you stopped atTr eblinka we
re you separated from any friends? 
 

A: No.We  would start separated from the begi
nning -- separate.  I knew some  friends who went 
with their grandparents. 
 

Q: No, I mean your group. You, you, your car, your 
wagon, relatives and a lot of friends that you 
mentioned? 
 

A: Just some  that I knew.  
Most were on other trains. 

 
Q: That means you all continued 
on after you stopped atTr eblinka? 
 

A: When we disembarked in Lublin, that is when I 
realized that we were so very few. That means 
that the rest either disappeared
 with the fi rst action --it was 
(?) big ghetto or were already 
separated and had gone on toTr eblinka and I kn
ow that my neighbors, young people, a boy and 
a girl, my age, went with their grandparen
ts, in a wheelchair, so obviously I knew what 
happened.And my father and my unc le came out 
of -- you never knew what it was -- steam was 
comi ng out from both. Sometimes the steam meant 
that there was steam comi ng down as well -- 
hot water comi ng for a wash-up. 
 

Q: You™re talking about Lublin? 

 

A: Ye s. We  we re all given -- no, no, we were not 
all given baths.  My par Œ our me n were given a 
bath. That included my cousin, my uncle, my b
oyfriend and my father, and they got out. We  
saw them. And they were brought to Majdanek. 
 Majdanek was behind, it was an adjunct, sort 
of a part, outlying area of the (?) of the c
oncentration camp. We  were walked to that 
concentration camp without the bath. 
 

Q: Thewo me n ?  

 

A: The wome n.And we were placed
 in a square with lights shining on us. We  were walked with 
the dogs and I was looking around saying, ﬁHow do I 
escape?  I™m going to my death.  How do  
            I?   Do I go to a Ge rman and tell him a story?  ﬁYou know, I™m an a dopted child.  I™m not 
Jewish.ﬂ  Maybe I can befriend a dog.  I don™t know
.  How do I go?  Wh ere do I go?ﬂ Nowhere.  
I got to that square and I becam
e fra ntic because I saw the steam houses.  I was sure this was the 
gas chamber, and no escape. And again, around the 
friendly faces of the Ukrainians, I tried to 
talk Ukrainian to them.  ﬁOh, you know, I™m really 
--ﬁ I was just out of my wits. Towards the 
morning I said to myself. ﬁI think I™m going to li
ve.ﬂ And all of a sudden I came to my mother 
and I said, ﬁYou know what, I have a feeling we™re 
going to live.  Now let™s stop that.ﬂ  Oh, my 

God, she was petrified.  I said, ﬁUh, uh, some thi
ng tells me  I™m going to live.ﬂ And I turned 
around to the others; I sai
d, ﬁLet™s  stop being stupid.  If they
 wanted to exterminate us, why did 
they bring us here and not there?
ﬂ  I was partially right because 
they did have a selection right 
there.  I was able to push my mother with me
 and we went to the bath instead of the gas 
chamber. We  got out, the others never did.  
We  were taken to Majdanek which was a nothing 
camp but occasionally we  would go to work. 
 

Q: You were with your mother? 

 

A: Always with my mother, yes. 

 

Q: Your mother was critic
izing you as she did before? 
 

A: Oh, no my mother was a child of mi ne.  From th
is point on just as she had been a child of my 
father, a subdued fema le, so now I became the leader
 in a very forceful ---.  Not only her but I 
was elected a st_______(? ) th
e leader of that particular --
 with all the older wome n a nd 
everythi ng.  Because they knew me  from school
 and some how I ma de this impression. My 
spirit wasn™t broken. As a st______, one morni
ng we walked out to work in the fields, 
some where collecting cabbages or whatever it wa s 
and we came  back late.  Instead of being 

brought to where we were on top of the field, we
 were lined up at th
e bottom of the fi eld 
precisely at the time that a factory camp like 
the one described in the book was looking for 
seamstresses, just for seamstresses.  I knew if 
they say seamstresses from a concentration camp, 
you raise your hand, oh, yes you are a seamstress.  
 So I raised my hand and the SS woma n was 
picking out specifically fair, ge
ntile-looking, young girls. That wa
s me  and in the back of me  
was my mot her.  Once she passed and she pointed 
to me  to go to the line, not only did I go but 
grabbed my mother and said you go and stood in 
front of her and hid her. That™s  how my 
mother ended up in the girls™ work camp. 
 
Q: Your mother was how old at this time? 

 

A: She was 49, that wasn™t  a girl. We  ended in 
a camp, Blitzen, (?). While we waited in Lublin 
train station, they ma rched in 350 men. While they
 were standing waiting also to be joined with 
us. This was the contingent of a city of
 150,000 Jews.  One hundred and fifty of us and 350 
me n. That™s all that eventually survived. 
 

Q: Brezany?  

 

A: That™s  when they were walk
ing to the train, I asked him. So
me body that I knew, did you see my 
father?   He said yes, he™s in the orchestra.  Oh
 I said, he must have more soup.  I was rejoicing 
for him.  Being something in camp to meant that he
™s a little better off.  
Little did I know what 
was going to happen.  So we worked in that B
litzen, indeed I worked 
in a knitting factory. 
 

Q: How close was Blitzen to ______? 

 

A: ToAuschwitz? 
 
Q: To Lublin. 

 

A: To Lublin.  No, I think this was the Blitzen.  
Wa s near Radom.  Not very fa r, I would say ---. 
 

Q: Anotherrailtrip? 

 

A: A 150, 200 miles. 

 

Q: So you went by train again? 

 

A: Ye s, by train.  But it wasn™t  a big trip, no.  
This camp was different.  It was not a typical 
concentration camp. It was a working camp where the families weren™t together, but women 

who ca me  before us had their clothing on, thei
r things, their belongings. We  didn™t, because 
they took it away. We c ame from a 
concentration camp.  But  they did. 
 

Q: What were you wearing? 

 

A: I had some  old rag with some th
ing on the back, whatever it was. 
 

Q: What they gave you at Lublin? 

 

A: Ye s, after the bath. Ye s, we looked real funny. 
They didn™t shave our heads at that time. That 

Blitzen was survivable until about Christmas of that year. 
 
Q: December,December____? 

 

A: Wa s okay.  By okay I meant the soup was pre
tty dense, there weren™t killings, there weren™t 
executions. They were intimidating, there were a lo
t of civilian Germans wo
rked the factories.  
Then there came  the leadership of Lublin, of
 that camp, Majdanek and took over.  Our camp 
became a concentration camp and things became worse. 
 

Q: So the Majdanek management basically, took over the management Blitzen? 

 

A: But I didn™t know how a nd why and then we 
discovered it.  Because some  wood, burning wood, 
woodpiles came from Lublin to us.  In them 
a piece of, a chunk of, a log was found was Hebrew 
inscription. That told us on Nove mb er 2, for th
ree days, machine-gunning 
of all Jews, they are 
no more. So we knew that I had no father, no boyfriend, no uncle and my mother ---. We ll, she 

said if I survive I can find anothe
r guy, she says.  Interesting, my
 mother.  I couldn™t believe it. 
 

Q: That™s her hu mor? 

 

A: No, it was a me thod for s urviving.  
Oh, we™ll ma nage, you did not despair. 
 

Q: So your father was killed
 in the final liquidation --? 
 

A: Of that Majdanek, the Jewish, it was a gigantic
 amount.   So that thes
e guys who escaped going 
to the front line ---- and I also 
discovered from the book, from Schli
ndler ™s  List, that all of these 
camps, the work camps, were really refugees fo
r enterprisi ng Germans. 
 Made a lot of money 
but they were all converted to concentrati
on camps.  Now without theWa nnsee Conference, 
they were planning for ma ss executions.  So we 
stayed in Blitzen and 
started hearing big guns 
going off in the East.  I went through dysentery 
and a severe one.  I went through typhoid fever, 
typhus because we were knitting th
e soldiers™ socks and they came w
ith lice.  It was a very big 
epidemic, lots of people died.  I not only didn™
t, if you want to know 
how easily I survived.  
Because I wa s a sports-minded, _______(? )  kind of girl.  I ha d typhus and the German doctor 

disbelieved it because  I was picked up from the f
actory with very high fever, walking.  So he 
personally came  to the hospital to examine me  and that wasn™t  done by German doctors.   

Because he didn™t believe -- it was after everybod
y had their typhus, I came  down wi th it.  He 
found that my spleen was yet to be enlarged
 but everybody had to go through 14 or 16 days.  I 
was done with it in 12. After 14 or 16 days pe
ople were just lying and I stood and nothing 

happened.  Furthermore, I ate and nobody ate.  
So I was never really very skinny because I 
utilized my fat and I was taught sparingl
y so I survived th
e typhus very well. 
 

Q: How was the food at this camp?  

 

A: We  counted it out.  I have a cousin who taught 
atYa le and in that camp, we came to a count of 
about 700 calories a day. That™s  a reducing di
et for sure.  Later it became  worse.  In a 
concentration camp, it was about 350 calories a day. 
 

Q: Majdanek? 

 

A: AndAuschwitz.  So that would have been ve
ry much more reducing.  
But I wasn™t  there long 

enough.  Fate has just foreshortened all of my suff
erings in this graceful wa y. We stayed there 
until May, I think, of ™44, in Blit
zen. Then they took us toAusc
hwitz with an order that these 
are German workers.  Nobody touched us, no sel
ection, no shaving heads, stamped numbers, all 
of us. The entire contingent of that camp got 
into theAuschwitz area.  People were asking me  
what is it? Who did you know?  To this day, I don™t know. 
 
Q: You were all Jewish?  

 

A: Ye s.  From t his book I™m surmising that thes
e civilian Germa ns still 
hoped that they can get 
some  of us out.  Because that™s what they did, 
that Schindler  did.  It was skilled workers he had 
there. Machinists, all kinds of people and he was 
hoping to get some  of us out.  I mean we could 
ma ke socks in no time and all kinds of things were done for the army.  I don™t reme mber if they 

did some  work for the navy. We  got toAuschwitz intact and my mother stayed with me . They 

had a selection there later and my mo ther st ayed 
with me .  Some how I ma na
ged until --.  By the 
way, inAuschwitz I was helping a Russian to pass soup to the officers who were in very bad 

shape. 
 

Q: Russianoffi cers?  

 

A: Ye s.   I helped a French ma rquis, ma nage to
 get a contact to keep some  Re d Russians and to 
give them to another camp. There were so many
 camps and I survived by being with them all 
day long.  Instead of sitting and mopi ng around a
nd being hungry, there was no work, I would 
go from contact to contact. Some  died and me t so
me  people fr om Paris and so forth so I did in 
that sense help. They helped me ; I got a litt
le more soup and I bring it to my mother who 
needed it more. 
 
Q: Where were you housed? 
 

A: In a barrack.  I™ve visited there, 
I™ve been toAuschwitz several times. 
 

Q: We re you in the ma in camp? 

 

A: No, Birkenau, Birkenau. 

 

Q: Birkenau? 

 

A: Ye s.  I was in the former gypsy camp.  It wa
s anA camp, no a B camp.  I had Œ my number was 
A. What was it Marvin, 4, 5?   45867
, my mother ™s was 45868, I think. 
 

Q: You weren™t tattooed? 

 

A: Ye s, I was.  I had it taken out because  I used to ha ng on a subway strap and people were 
looking.  I came  here before anybody else.  
I just didn™t want to have it on me . 
_____________(? ) . 
 

Q: We re you put in slave labor? 

 

A: No, once I was. They didn™t and if so, it was busy. Birkenau, you were waiting your turn 
basically but this was the end of the war.  
What started was exporting people to replenish 

mi ssing slave labor of other nationalities.  People
 were getting out, some  of them might have 
just gone to be exterminated, you never knew.  
There was a civilian comi ng it was more likely 
to be for work. He was handpicking his -- mi nd you they claime d they didn™t know what they 
were doing. What were they doing picking 
people?  They didn™t  know it was there. 
 

Q: And you arrived in May of 1944? 

 

A: I was there until November. 

 

Q: Did you notice operations? 

 

A: Absolutely.  I was near the gas chamber because
 when we arrived that scene, the girls showed 
me .  Once I did go on a work there.  I wouldn™t 
see the bodies.   Furthermore, how could you 
mi ss it? These chimneys, the four chimneys were smoking so viciously, with such a stench, that 

only the burning of animal fat, animal protein 
could produce. You couldn™t mi ss it, the stench 
was awful, and it was so hot, the flame was comi ng out.  Because they were very heavy 

hydrocarbons, pardon my biochemi stry, comi
ng through.  It was incomplete combustion, 

because of the amount of bodies and the pauc
ity of oxygen. So it was black smoke that was 
catching on fire from the  heat. What was it?   
And I was right next to
 the train, the rails. 
 

Q: Did you see the people arriving? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: What do you reme mber seeing? 

 
A: I saw people dressed beautifully some times.  Be
ing aroused, ma rched, I saw all that you see in 
the movies, I really saw it. Then I could see 
trainload of 50 people comi ng into camp of a load 
of thousands. 
 
Q: Now this was the busiest time inAuschwitz? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: A time of the Hungarian deportation? 

 

A: Right.  Not only this, we  saw. We  didn™t know wh
at they were doing there.We  hadn™t  worn this 
kind of clothing for a long time.  But there they we re comi ng in and it was happening at night.  

We  had the so-called blockspech ______(? ) .The 
block was closed; you never went out to the 
bathroom at night. You just used the barrels, 
but on the outside of the block, they would bring 
them in and you couldn™t when they had the blockspech _______. We  told one another, ah, 

coals have arrived for the stoves. Yes, I knew 
about this and yes I knew about the me n™s camp.  
We  saw them, they were less capable of surv
iving.We  saw the so-called muselmenn looking 
worse and worse.Wa sn™t  very bad, not as bad as it 
was in the spring.We re r
eal horrors in there.  
We  seen people being punished by having to si
t down in ditches for a day with hands-up.  
Torture. We  seen beatings; we seen people on the 
electrified wire fences.  
I just di scovered -- I 
was giving that soup and I was told don™t have your hands shake, you gonna feel the field.  I 

didn™t and that book claims that the 
inner fences were not electrifie
d that we were told untruth.  
That to scare us they told us these we re electri
fied wires but that they weren™t. But the outer 

ones were. 
 
Q: I™d like to ask you to backtr
ack just a little bit. Your j
ourney toTr eblinka and then to 
Majdanek? 
 

A: And then to Blitzen. 

 

Q: And then toAuschwitz. Certainly in the early pa
rt of this trip, you were in the same  car as your 
parents --? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: And other members of your fa mily and your hometown? 

 

A: No, just my parents. 

 

Q: Ye s.  Do you recall what was being said, what 
wa s being thought during th
ese days of traveling, 
the time  that you were waiting to 
see what would happen atTreblinka? 
 

A: No, I would say that people prayed, I would 
say that ma ny people hugged or, if they we re my 
kind, walked around. You™ve seen the animals at th
e zoo? Back and forth, back and forth. That 
was me  at all times, where do I go, what do I do? 
 

Q: You paced inside the cattle car? 

 

A: No, I was thinking, I was active.  I would go 
to a person and say what do you think we could 
do?   Do you think there are loose 
part s. Where is the -- getting 
the information -- what could be 
done?   Same in camp.  I met a Hunga rian and a Roma
nian girl and French girls.  Some  people I 

knew from Brezany would surface there. What do you know from the outside and what do you 

think is going to happen?  Do you know if they™re burning, what kind of people?   Does that 

mean that we™re staying?  Just constantly doing 
some thing.  In a sense of being involved with 
people who were doing so me thing and possibly pr om
oting my mother ™s survival.  Because if 
some thing was going on and we could become  pa
rt of it -- or  at least get some better 
accommodat i ons.That was happening all along.  If
 you could become  a helper of the kapo or 
something like this, that meant survival, at
 least temporarily.  N
obody was thinking tomorrow 
but nothing like this happened. 
 

Q: But in the cattle car, before you actually
 arrived, was the sense of, the mo od of --? 
 

A: Desperate. 

 

Q: Desperate. What were othe
r people doing, saying on the train?
 What were they expecting? 
 

A: There was fighting for water. We  we re beastly 
thirsty; we were drinking all sorts of dirty water 
that some  pitying Ukrainian would give to us. 
 People had to defecate and urinate where they 

stood.  Some people were fighting. There was 
no friendly atmosphere.  If you know t he biology 
of the crowded rat, you don™t expect that from 
people in those conditions
.  Huma n behavior is 
not very diff erent.   But we were the young, we 
were part of some thing, some  hopeful thing, we 
felt. 

 
Q: I reme mber there was a debate during the initial
 train trip about whether 
to try to jump out of 
the train? 
 

A: Ye s, we would have, several of us. 

 

Q: Were there ot her si milar type --? 

 

A: Escapes? 

 

Q: No, not so much escapes but argume nts, de
bates regarding what to do?What to expect? 
 

A: No, the only impression I have is a very nega
tive one, is from the same  religious people who 
believed that  G-d will help them but did not see that so much more will be achieved if at least 

some  of us survived to have children and so fo
rth. There was a chance, because people did get 
to the partisans. My boyfriend, as
 I told you, jumped the train and survived that time. That™s 
how I could have but you had to have money to 
pay that farmer not to infor m --.  For the 

imme diate thing, without money, there wasn™t  ve
ry much of a chance.  Even your gun wouldn™t 
have really helped you on your own.  It™s  
only when you™re already with a group. 
 

Q: You and your mother rema ined together through the time  you were inAuschwitz? 

 

A: All the way to Novembe r  when they had anothe
r selection. At  that one
, she was so debilitated 
and old looking that she no longer passed.  I hid her 
again in back of me  and she was pulled out.  
I went after her and my friends grabbed me  and 
s a id don™t you dare.  She ended up in what used 
to be a chamber of the doomed. This painting I 
have, I made it.  It™s in my family. The place 
didn™t have windows, it had skylights, painted.  
They waited there until the black ______(? )  was 
completely enclosed. Most barracks were just fre
e, that one had a little
 enclosure and grating 
with wires.At night, a black truck would come  
and take them to be gassed.  So the next 
morning after a night of anguish and guilt fee
ling, why didn™t I go with her?  Some body came 
and said, she isn™t gassed, that™s  where she is. 
 I went there and lo 
and behold, the door was 
open.  Later I learned that there was an explosion in the gas chamber. Ther e was an uprising, 

they went up with it. Then some thing, I 
think the Swiss commission, whatever it wa s, my 
mother was there because they sepa rated the old from the younger. Still this kind of selection 

going on, in part because now they really were
 taking the young ones to work. They didn™t 
know yet how they™re going to ki
ll the old, the older people. I cam
e to her every day and even 
there they had a selection because
 theTheresienstadt women came. 
 

Q: So your mot her was saved basically by the revo
lt that took place in the 
crematorium?  This was 
in, say November of 1944?  
 So you™re again together? 
 

A: In a sense.  I was in a different group. Then 
things became very bad with me.  It may have been 
the beginning of typhoid fever or it
 ma y have simply been the food or it ma y have been an ulcer 
but I was vomiting.  I was taking whatever it 
was in the morning and vomi ting. Ta king 
whatever it was later and vomiti
ng.  I knew that that meant that I would die and my mother 

would see me die. I then decided I™ll take a chan
ce.They were taking people, some  to work and 
others to be killed and others to diffe r ent camps.
 We were quite close to the fr ont line with the 
Russians. The Russians came in January, I think; this was November.  So I spoke with my 

mother and I said I am going to try to get you on 
the list of the capable work. You™re not that 

old, don™t act old.Act young, perk up and so fort
h and you will yet go to work. But I can™t wait 
because I™m dying, I™ve got to get out.  Something 
in the water, or some thing in the food but I 
can™t  hold it. Ye s, she said, I, some how thr
ough a doctor, reached, and there was another one, 
We iss I think was his name , a Ge
rman doctor who was ma king the selections.  He put on the list 
of those who were capable of work. The rest 
of those people were left
 in that place were 
liberated by the Russians.  But my poor mother 
was taken, with the people who were on the list, 
on the death ma rch to Bergen-Belsen. 
 

Q: This was in January? 

 

A: She survived until the end of February.  She died a natural death in Bergen-Belsen. 

 

Q: If you call it that? 

 

A: We ll, everybody was starving.  She was in bed. 

 

Q: She was ma rched all the way to Bergen-Belsen? 

 

A: The situation there was just 
absolutely awful.The y were ha
rdly giving them any food and she 
was already exhausted. 
 

Q: She died in ---? 

 

A: In bed.  My friend was with her one evening, talk
ing to her.  She was telling her I™m trying very 
hard to survive, to live.  I know that™s the end a
nd I just want to live, I have two daughters.  She 

believed my  sister was alive.  She worried more
 about me  than she worried about my  sister 
because of the vomiting but she wanted to survive. 
 
Q: She died in her bunk? 

 

A: She came in the morning, the bed was empty.  Sh
e can™t  reme mber if it was February or March.  
She approxima tes based on the day of liberation, so
meti me inApril, something.  So it was not 
when the British were there as I was told. And ot
hers had seen her too and seen her walking to 
the bathroom.  In other words, she was not si
ck, sick, she wa s just debilitated, worn out. 
 

Q: Wherewereyou? 

 

A: I was taken to a munitions factory, 
L____(? )  near where Kr
up_____work and all that. 
 

Q: This is January, ™44? 

 

A: I worked, made hand grenades and befriended 
some  Italian prisoners 0f war who refused to 
fight on the Leningrad front.They were taken back
 to Germany and put to work.  I befriended a 
German ove rseer, an older guy, who came to my work
 and said I want to hear the story. We  
spoke German and little by little
 I told him.  So I found a sandwich on my workbench every 
night.  It was a night shift, a 
night shift which was constantly 
interrupted by the British, came at 
night and theAmericans came at daytime. Th
at lasted until the end of March but in the 
meanti me  I became sick with typhoid fever. 
 

Q: So you went from typhus to typhoid?  
 

A: I was taken to the typhus barracks (?) the qua
rantine.  Once again I showed everybody a mi racle 
because I walked.  I wasn™t  even si ck but my fecal examination was constantly showing the 

bacillus. Again it was hard to be
lieve that they couldn™t --.  I got
 to look and act so much better 
that I started me nstruati
ng.  Now I™ m me nstruating, you didn™t have enough fat 
 

Q: We re you treated by German doctors or by prisoners? 

 

A: Prisoner, a Hungarian doctor. 
 But I had a friend, he was a Po
lish SS man.  He was a former 
PPS or socialist or a communist, Polish
 fro m ___ ____(? )  who knew my  fa ther. 
 

Q: Some one who knew your father. 
Wa s he _______ or in the SS? 
 

A: He was given an option. We  either shoot 
you or you go to the SS. He wa s bringing me  onion 
because that was some thing very valuable as you know. 
 

Q: Did he recognize you?   

 

A: No, he didn™t know me .  He was -- but he knew my
 father because he pr obably was a musician.  
Well, I saved his life later, I mediated betw
een him and the gum chewing GI. But in 19___. I 
got out of the typhus-barracks 
as I said to you, menstruating 
and looking so well that the 
Germans we re asking me , where have you been, at a 
resort?  This is what I mean, survival of 
the fittest, I wanted to surviv
e.  I must have been endowed with some  survival genes which 
unfortunately doesn™t  serve me  right now. 
 
Q: You look like a pre
tty tough lady to me . 
 
A: We ll, after this, the order 
still was _________Judenrein (? ).  No
 ma tter what you were or what 
you looked like. At the end of March, they
 ma rched us out of that L______towards 
Buchenwald only they didn™t get too fa r. They 
came to a little village Kaunitz, K-a- u-n-i-t-z. I 

mi ght visit it if I have enough nerve. We  sat in 
the ditches and right in 
front of us, there moved 
a jeep with a white star on it. We  had better se
nse than say a boo.  First of all, they probably 
wouldn™t have heard us and second of all, we 
could have been shot.We  looked like the army, 
later on the patrolling airp
lane told us they didn™t know what
 the hell was going. They™d never 
seen anythi ng like it.We  each wore an army blanket on us. They didn™t know if we were army 

wome n. They never saw Jews. We  were the firs
t liberat ed Jewish women yet. So we let the 
Americans pass and sat in the ditch. All of 
a sudden all of our SS disappeared on us. The 
overseer, his mi stress, everybody except for the 
Polish SS.  He said, Pan_____(? ) , he called me  
Irene, you reme mber don™t you?   I says yes, I re
member, stay with us. We  saw the whole 
village was hanging white flags out. At that 
point I became  a front
-runner because I knew 
English. 
 

Q: Your boyfriend™s help? 

 

A: I still thought that they we re 
British.  I didn™t know theAmericans were at war. We  walked to 
the village proper and there stood 
a tank with this gum- chewing i
ndividual, his funny helmet.  I 
asked him, who are you?   He says I™m anAmerica
n.  I said, where from?  He gave me , I said are 

you sure you™re not British?  They all started 
laughing and they asked me  who I was.  I told 

them and he said, I don™t believe it. He called in
 so and so and they came over to us and took 
out their mezuzah and asked me  to identify.. I told them what  it was,  So they what they call 
organized, they didn™t organize t
hose tanks right away.  They occupied the whole village and 
kicked the Germans out and said girls, this is
 yours.  Everythi ng in it and we will br ing you 
more. And they did!  Clothes and chocolate, 
started pushing on us, crying some  of these guys.  
You are the first surviving girls yet. We  can 
fraternize with you, you™re not German.  It was 
something fi rst for the -- especially the Jewish GI™s
. We  stayed in that village and that™s when I 
me t Captain Lubetsky who was in charge of theAmerican garrison there who was looking for 

an interpreter. I was walking with a frying pan 
to the burgomei ster to have it fixed.That™s  how 

brazen we were.  Hey toots, said he , and proceeded to talk to me  and discovered because I 

spoke Russian and he was in charge of the 
PW a nd DP camps. Come  on, he said, you™re going 
to be working with us. What kind of house woul
d you like?   I said with a piano.  Okay it will 
be with a piano. They found a house with a piano and I was working with the army all through.  

Then the British came  and took over. Again 
I worked with the British and recuperated and 

traveled to Bergen-Belse n to find my mother. 
 But what was in my mi nd was what my uncle 
said.You find your sister.  So some time s in Nove
mber, I declared myself to be a Soviet citizen 
because that™s where I thought my sister wa
s. They needed some body to accompany the 
Soviets, the PW™s who refused to go back home to the Ukraine which would have been where I 

wanted to go.  I went with them. 
 

Q: Go home  voluntar
ily or involuntarily? 
 

A: Voluntarily.  It was a ma tter of propaganda. 

 

                             (END OF SIDEA,TAPE 11)  

 Why would they be willing to get them?  What do
 they need them for?  These are all traders, 
they™re not going to shoot them all?   He said, 
why not?   Little did I know!  I didn™t believe it, 
not based on the behavior they showed to us when 
we were there.  It was none of this St alin™s  
paranoia at that point. That was later on so I 
went all throughWa rsaw.  I saw whatWa rsaw 
looked like and while I was (PAUSE INTAPE) 
 

Q: You saw fly e rs inWa rsaw? 

 

A: This was announcing hangings of those who stag
ed the pogrom in Lublin of Jews.  I will find 
my sister but I™m not staying.  I went to the Soviet Union.  First of all,
 I was dragging with me  
Polish-Jewish girls who didn™t speak a word 
of Russian to discover on the German-Polish 
border that it was no longer Sovi
et Union, but it was Poland. Th
at all the Soviet Jews were 
comi ng back.  So now I was going into the Soviet
 Union and I belonged here.  I couldn™t  tell 
them that I was Polish so with my pu
rest Russian I said
 __________(? ) .Who, me ?  ______ 
They™re all Russian.  I passed through. 
 

Q: AllRussiangirls? 

 

A: I have this ability to mi mi c an accent.  I we
nt through the Soviet Uni
on to once again encounter 
anti-Semitism.  Jews don™t wash, Jews go to the front
 of the lines, they don™t fight.  I di dn™t tell 
them I was Jewish.  I learned right away if I wa
nt to go through that without much ha ssle, what 
do I have to tell them I was Jewish.  I told  them _____(? )  Polish.  I could hear it and I 

imme diately realized that this 
is not a country I wa nt.  I went
 through the Soviet Union to the 
place where my aunts were last .  I found some  Ukra
inian patients of hers who told me  that they 

were all transported to what was formerly Ge
r many and now became Poland.  It was a trading.  
Polish Ukrainian became Soviet Ukrainian and Polish Jews from there were -- and Poles, not 

just Polish Jews --. 
 

Q: These were aunts from which town? 

 

A: The town was B____(? )  which was the only part 
of Poland where they had oil, mi ne. That™s 
where she lived and that™s  where my  sister went 
to visit before the war started.  I supposed she 
had some  kind of pneumonia and that was good for 
her.  I still didn™t kno
w if my sister was 
alive but I heard that she was onAryan papers. 
 Fr om there I went to Poland, to a Jewish 
committee in Prague. They looked up lists and yes, 
your aunt is in such-and-such place.  I went 
there and they greeted me with wh
ere is your mother?  We  heard sh
e was alive.  I went to tell 
them the story and -- why did you leave her?  Can you imagine having this
 kind of greeting.  I 
needed a psychiatrist right there! They told me , 
yes, your sister is alive 
but she never told these 
people that she™s Jewish.  She™s going out w
ith a boy who doesn™t  know she™s Jewish.  She 
doesn™t  want  to be Je wish.  Maybe she will change if she sees you.  So I went over there and 

she didn™t change.  My parents ki
lled Christ and I told her, years ago it wouldn™t have ma ttered 
to me  but now I am Jewi sh so we better part compan
y.  I suggest, I told he
r, I don™t want to stay.  
I have to be on my own and I want to be where 
I am going to be free.  I am going back to the 

army and I am offering it to you.  I will ma
nage, you come with me.  No, no, she had a 
boyfriend, her church and so forth.  I left and 
the only way I could go is
 with the Germans who 
were being sent to Germany from the Polish part.  But how can I go as a Pole, impossible.  I 

took my papers and they became my citizenship 
pa pers and I didn™t speak a word of Polish. 
 

Q: You mean -- which papers now? 

 
A: I had an army paper:ToWhom It May C
oncern, Miss Irene Hass is 
our interpreter and we 
would appreciate it if all help were given to 
her.  She is looking for her family in Poland. 
 
Q: So this is anAmerican document in English? 

 

A: That was British. 

 

Q: British, a British document in English ---. 

 

A: Which they couldn™t really beli
eve.  It had a very fancy stamp,
 it looked like a true citizenship 
papers, not very much different fr om my citizenship papers here. That™s what I ma naged to tell 

them. 
 

Q: So you were able to fool the Poles? 

 

A: They let me  though both the Poles and the Russian
s.  Not only this but on one corner of the 
bridge, they were telling the other corner, hey you
 there. This is not a German girl, don™t be 
fooling around. They were raping Ge rmans. Thi s 
is the way I got to Berlin,We st Berlin, into a 
British citizen camp which also had theAKA and 
theAKA army,Those soldiers were telling 

me, you can tell them the truth now. You don™t have to tell them you™re a British subject by 

birth here.  Oh, no I said. What do you mean, 
my father, my mother, now I don™t reme mber 
who was British.  I went  back because  of my mo
t her or because of my fat her but my whole 
fa mily™s  there.  I was questioned by the British an
d I am sure that they di dn™t  believe one word 

of what I was saying but I was much too young to
 know from such things.  I maintained my 
story.  I was afraid they would send me  back. 
 I didn™t tell them and I 
couldn™t get out of the 
situation because they had written to Great Brit
ain, it would have come  out.  I was wise enough 
to say I better get out of here. Where do I go, 
I always wanted to go to the university, mi nd you.  
I went to Berlin Medical School and it was ra
ining through the roof which was non-existent.  
They told me the only university which is totally intact is Heidelberg. That sounded great so I 
had a story.  I came to them and said, my medical
 school told me  that I can get a transfer to 
Heidelberg.  I did go to Heidelbe
rg and I said let me  know when
 the papers come from Great 
Britain.  I we nt to Heidelberg and that was th
e first time  whe r e I became me .  Not only did I 
become  me , I enrolled at the university as an
 under- student but the Ph
iladelphia Inquirer ran 
pictures of me .  Here they are. This was all 
in the Philadelphia Inquirer
 playing the piano. You 
see that  I am corpulent. This is the UNRRA offi
cer and I am sitting in the offi ce. This is Ruth 
Krager that was in my girls™ dorm. This is th
e JWV, Jewish center wher
e the GI™s met with the 
Jewish girls and we had our salami  and coke
, salami  sandwich and coke. These papers 

appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer and my co
usin is in Philadelphi
a and they discovered a 
survivor, one lonely survivor there, me .A telegr
am ca me , re gistered to theAmerican council for 
a visa. At the time where I had already applied 
for savant (?) because I did speak French.  I 
decided to go toAmerica.  Before that time, a 
little bit before that happened in Heidelberg, a 

very strange thing occurred.  Because I am 
not an English speaking person and because my 
behavior was very much like th
at of gentiles andWa sps and 
because there was preconceived 
notion of children of immi grants who came here
 from the little shtetls without ma nners and 
without this and that, that I co
uldn™t be Jewish.   I was summone
d before the and I didn™t  speak 
Yi ddish -- in other words, I just didn™t fit.The 
other Jewish boys and gi
rls even at the medical 
school were more like the t
ype that you would find among Ne wYork Jewish people for 
instance.  It  was just a total bi as. I was summone
d to prove that I was Jewish.  I was questioned 

by a Canadian head of the Joint Distribution Co
mmittee to pr ove to them that I was Je wish 
before I get the toothpaste and th
e toothbrush or whatever else. 
 

Q: Didn™t you have your tattoo? 

 

A: That didn™t mean anything.  I c
ould have done it to myself.  So 
I asked him.  He had an aide 
who was a German Jew. I asked him do you speak any Hebrew?   He said no and I proceeded to 

recite poetry by the noted poet Bialy (? ) All he 
was intere sted in was the prayer s and I knew the 

prayers and after two mi nutes, th
ey realized.  I didn™t have 
enough guts and knowledge to just 
tell this guy what here the Polis
h organization was begging me to 
sign that I am Polish and give 
me  anything just to sign. We  a
ll signed stateless, we were furi
ous with the Poles. Why would 
he want me  to prove I wa s Jewish?   Surely 
I wasn™t  German, so what was I, Polish? Why 

couldn™t you give me  a toothpaste and toothbrush 
to a Polish girl? That was horribl e, I will 

never forget this denigrating e
xperience.  But eventually my visa didn™t come , I didn™t wait and 
meanwhileTr uman signed a 2,000 person collective 
visa for professional students and such.  I 
was asked to sign that.  I came here on that coll
ective visa and my visa went to some body else.  
 

Q: When did you come  here? 

 

A: I  came here with the very first Marine perc
h (? ) in May of 1946.  I wa
s greeted by the press for 
whom this was the first experience.  Nobody came be
fore and that was that.  I stayed with my 
relatives for a while. I knew Eng
lish well enough to imme diately enter Hunter College. Tr ied to 
get to me dical school, didn™t have the money.
  I knew Russian, taught myself to type and 
worked as a translator for Russians who went to
 school.  One of these days, I was introduced by 

my for mer boyfriend to that guy and that™s  how 
the story goes. We ™re still friends with the 
boyfriend. 
 
Q: Still married to the guy too? 

 

A: Still married to the guy. 

 

Q: What happened to your gra
ndmother back in Brezany? 
 

A: I am told Œ I was told by one of my a unts th
at was in the hiding -- I am assumi ng that she ma y 
have heard it from the Ukrainians.  She was 
hidden by the Ukrainian family -- that my 

grandmother couldn™t get off the bed.  She was 
clubbed to death and that my aunt and my 

cousin, my girl cousin, were taken away.What
 happened after that, I don™t know if they were 
shot, executed on the ceme tery or wherever or ta
ken to a camp to be executed.  Some how I have 
the feeling that some body said my little cousin 
wa s trying to run away.  He did lookAr yan, he 
was blond and all this. 
 

Q: Sylvia™s brother? 

 

A: Brother, that they shot. 

 

Q: From the letters that you received, th
ey were still alive in the spring of 1943? 
 

A: Yes.  I™m putting that togeth
er with what I know later and th
ey probably perished in that 
massacre. 
 
Q: The final deportation? 
 

A: I didn™t even know that that™s  what it was.  I 
thought they were just do
ing it to people who were 
in bed killing them on the spot.  So with the re
st of the fa mily.  Countless mounds of -- those 
who didn™t mi grate to the United St ates at the end of the 19
th
 century, some of my relatives were 
here already, and later. Those who were, were
 still _____(?).  Some  great
 aunts and uncles and 
cousins and second cousins that were there. 
 

Q: Did you return to Brezany at
 the end of the war in ™45? 

 

A: No. That became the Soviet Union.  No, I didn™t go there. 

 

Q: You just went looking for your sist
er and your aunt and that was it? 
 

A: Ye s, because  by then I already knew that ther
e wa s nothing left. There were no small towns that 
had survivors.  No point going anywhere, no su
rvivors anywhere.  Comi ng back from ca mps 
later, they we re often hiding. 
 

Q: I have one small question I would like to ask 
you.  I™m pretty sure you™ll know the answer to 
this one. That is the day that you were lib
erated, I™m sure you will not forget.  Do you 
reme mber the date? 
 

A: April1
st
. 

 
Q: April Fool™s  Day. So you were 
one of the first to be liberated? 
 

A: We  had to be, we were almost at the Dutch 
border, oh yes we were. They had just broken 
through. They were stalled, this is why we were ma rched toward Buchenwald because they 

were stalled. They were bombing but they were 
stalled for a while at Ochen(? )  and we were not 
very far from Ochen. 
 

Q: Nor mally, the forced ma rches and evacuations
 were in the opposite direction but instead you 
were moved closer towards the front? 
 

A: No, we were moved closer -- in between 
the Russians and theAmericans, Buchenwald. 
 

Q: I™m saying Buchenwald --. 

 

A: Closer to the Russians. 

 

Q: Yeah, so you were moved in a westerly direction? 

 

A: In an easterly direction -- we were between th
e two fighting armi es. They had no way, we were 
almost at theAmerican lines, we couldn™t go we
st. There was south, they could have taken -- 

no, Bergen-Belsen was liberated ma ybe 15 days later 
so that entire front 
line was really broken 
through. The only way they could go is a little 
further east. That indeed took a longer time.  
Buchenwald was liberated much worse, much later and was in a worse shape. 
 

Q: That™s right. 
 
A: They had an order because each working cam
p was known as the ouser
kommando and we were 
ouserkommando of Buc henwald. That™s  why they 
are ma rching us there but never got there.  
That Polish soldier, I told theAm
erican.  I said now look, he was kind, he was helpful.  I said at 
least question him.  I wa s under the assumption he
 was going to be shot.  Because later on I did 
some  things I shouldn™t have done. Wo me n captured a horrible, horrible overseer who™s 

beating, in Germany, be ating the wome n merciless.
 The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme .  
He says if I give him to the CID forg et it.  
With the white gloves nothing™s  going to be done. I 
know what we™ll going to do.  I have a dumb so- a nd-
so southerner.  I will tell him that if this 
guy budges, he™s to shoot.  I™m going to stand ther
e and I™m going to call for him to come to me.  
Don™t say a word, he said to me .  I said okay 
at first. This procedure was being enacted, 
some thing drove me  out of it.  I screamed, no, do
n™t you dare to do it and spoiled the story.  He 
said why did you?   I says killed 
in battle but kill, his wife and 
children are standing, that™s not a 
revenge. We  are not vengeful people and that is
 what I would like to say to the blacks who 
executed a Jew. We  didn™t  do it, very few cases
 where the people got ou
t of ca mps and killed 
Germans. You would have heard about them. We  are not vengeful people and I didn™t have it 

in me  at that point, at least, or now.  I am not 
able to go to Germany and enjoy it, sightsee at this 
point because of the things that have been ha
ppening.  I cringed when I me et Germans who are 

the proper age and start questioning me  where fr
om Poland, where am I from?   I see the type 
but beyond this ---.  ﬁNever againﬂ means don™t letit go and get to that point. That wa s before.  

At this point I am most concerned with anti-S
emitism whereas before I was concer ned with all 
kinds of biases.This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious 

and vicious because it singles one
 particular group of people to
 cure all ills anywhere you go. 

You na me  a country where there was no anti-Sem
itism and no killing of Jews.  So it™s much 
worse than blacks because they™re not being single
d out all over the world.  But Jews are, even 
in Japan, that never had and doesn
™t  have Jews.  Now I™ m saying ch
arity begins at home .  I put 
all of my e fforts trying to stop this vici
ous happening. That™s just the way it is. 
 
Q: I thank you on behalf f the United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum and I certainly hope that 
your wish will come true. 
 

A: I hope so. 

 

Q: Thank you.
