Question:  This is a United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum interview with Mr. 
Roger Neighborgall.  Did I 
pronounce that correct?               
 
Answer:  That's correct      
 
Q: Okay.  Taking place on 
May 2, 2014.      
 
A: That's correct.      
 
Q: In Falls Church, Virginia.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And we're going to be talking today, 
Mr. Neighborgall, about your experiences in 
World War II. And --      
 
A: Except I'm not 'Mr. Neighb
orgal'; I'm Roger.      
 
Q: Okay.  We're going to be talking with
 you, Roger, thank you -- about World War II -- 
your experiences there -- what you saw, and 
much much more -- what
 comes from that.  
But we're going to start at the beginning.  And 
we want to get a sens
e of who you were as 
the war began and how old you were and things
 like that. So very fi
rst question is, "When 
were you born?  Wh ere were you born?  An d 
what was your name at birth?"      
 
A: Okay.  I was born in Garrett, Indi
ana on September 13, 1923.      
 
Q: Gary, Indiana?      
 
A: Garrett --  G-A double R, E, double T.       
 
Q: J-A double R? 
 
A: E, double T.      
 
Q: Got it.  Garrett.  Were --      
 
A: Garrett, Indiana is a suburb
 of Fort Wayne.      
 
Q: I see.  A nd were you born into a 
large family or a small one?      
 
A: No, one sister who was two years older than me.      
 
Q: What was her name?      
 
A: Betty Jane.  And my mother's name was Jane.      
 

Q: And your father's?      
 
A: Homer.      
 
Q: And how did your fa
ther support the fami ly?  I assume it was your father.      
 
A: He worked as a lumber in
spector for the Baltimore & Ohio
 Railroad.  Garrett, Indiana 
was a -- being an  old railroad town , it wa
s 150 miles from Chicago on th e B&O, and 
everybody in Garrett either wo
rk ed for the B& O or did something to  support the people 
who worked for the B&O -- like 
the grocery store.      
 
Q: I got it.      
 
A: A drugstore.      
 
Q: Uh-huh.  Do you have any earliest memo ries
 from either your home or your family or 
the town itself?      
 
A: Yes, I have lots of them.  As a matter of
 fact, I continue in touch with one of my  
classmates.      
 
Q: Really?
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: From grade school and from high school.      
 
A: Grade school and high school.      
 
Q: Wow.  So tell me a little bit about your
 family -- the family you were born in to -- 
about your father, what kind of
 a person he was, your mo th
er, and some of the values 
they tried to -- let's say, share w
ith the kids and so  on.      
 
A: Okay.  First of all w e were very poor
 family. We lived in a 2-bedroom house, little 
frame house.  I think we sold it for $2,000 
or something wh en we left. Maybe $3,000.  
But that didn't bother me, because none of
 my  friends had any money.  It was the 
Depression was on in th is country.      
 
Q: Yeah, as you were growing up.      
 
A: As I was growing up, I grew up in depression.      
 
Q: Did your father still have his 
job during the Depression?      
 
A: No, he work ed wherever he could.  But 
the B & O laid off almo
st everybody ex cept 
for the train crews.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And did your mo ther ha
ve to work or try to?      
 

A: My mo th er was a nurse volunteer, and she 
volunteered at the Catholic hospital as a 
nurse's assistant but not for money.
 
Q: How large was Garrett, Indiana?      
 
A: Say again?      
 
Q: How large was --      
 
A: 5,000.      
 
Q: Did you pretty mu ch know most of the pe
ople there -- or did your fami ly?      
 
A: Well, yeah -- that's  
good and bad, because everybody al
so knew me.  [laughing]      
 
Q: [laughing]      
 
A: If I did something wrong, my  mo ther 
knew about it before I got home.      
 
Q: Oh, that's a very effective network.      
 
A: [laughing]      
 
Q: Were your parents religious at all?      
 
A: My mother was very religious. 
 My father -- medium.      
 
Q: Can I ask which religion?      
 
A: Yes.  My mother was a -- we g rew up in 
a Presbyterian church.  
My mother was raised 
as a Catholic and changed to Protestant for my
 father.  Then, after 
they were married for 
some period of time, she went back to the Cat
holic church and my sister went back with  
her.      
 
Q: And yourself?      
 
A: I became a Catholic during the war.      
 
Q: Did you?  I see.
 
A: In Germany.      
 
Q: And -- but, before the war, 
did you go to  church ?  Did yo
u go to services?      
 
A: Yes, we went to ch ur
ch every Sunday.      
 
Q: So what's the difference between going to
 church an d becoming a Catholic during th e 
war?  Going to church as a kid, and then --      
 

A: I guess I don't really know.  Du ring th
e war I was convinced I wasn't going to live 
through it, and I decided I wanted to be buried
 as a Catholic.  That was kind of the way it 
went.      
 
Q: I see.  Were there many religions in Garrett, Indiana?      
 
A: Garrett was a very religious town.  There were
 at least a dozen church es, maybe 15.      
 
Q: Most of them were Protestant, or 
most of them were Catholic?      
 
A: No, no, no -- there was only on
e Catholic; the rest of them 
were all Protestant.      
 
Q: I see.      
 
A: But the Methodists, the Bap
tists -- they were all over the place.  All my friends went 
to church.      
 
Q: Okay.  Regardless of which church, 
they all went to a church.      
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Were there any Jewish people?      
 
A: Very few, but some.      
 
Q: Did your paths ever cross 
with anybody who was Jewish as
 you were growing up?      
 
A: Well, the -- the local men 's haberdashery 
was run by a Stern family, and I knew them 
very well.  But they  didn't have any ch ildren.      
 
Q: It was a husband and wife?      
 
A: It was husband and wife.      
 
Q: How is it that you got to know them?      
 
A: I was very involved in athletics, and they  we
re supporters of my wo
rk -- of my --      
 
Q: Activities?      
 
A: -- accomplishments in athletics.      
 
Q: Did you ever have a part-time j
ob as you were a teenager?      
 
A: Yes.  As a matter of fact, I had a pape
r route of 75 cu stomers, which I had from the 
fourth  grade on. In ab out the fourth grad e, my
 father said to me, "I would like for you to 
be the first Neighborgall to graduate from co
llege, but you have to
 understand I don't 
have a penny to  give you; you have
 to do it on your own."      
 
Q: Did you want that?      
 

A: And so, I immediately decided that the 
way I was going to  get through college, which 
I did, was athlete scholarships.      
 
Q: Ah -- I see.      
 
A: And that was what's  -- that 
was my father instigat
ed it when  he said, "I want you to  be 
a college graduate, but you have 
to understand I don't have any 
money to give you."      
 
Q: And is that what you mean
t by support from the Stern family
 is that they contributed 
in some way?      
 
A: No, not financially.  They  
contributed by being active lookers
 in the audience.      
 
Q: So they'd go to 
your games.      
 
A: Yeah, they 'd  go to games.      
 
Q: I see.  D id -- what was high 
school like in the 30's?      
 
A: High school -- my class -- I th ink they ar
e like 78 in my  high school grad uating class.  
I grew up, from the first grad
e to the seventh grade in ab
out 60, and then the country  
schools came to high school, which served as 
a county high school as well as a city high 
school.      
 
Q: So it enlarged -- the cl
asse s got bigger?      
 
A: Enlarged  -- 17 or 18 came in from the country .      
 
Q: Was there an immigrant population in your
 town ? Did you know any kids in the class 
who were from, let's say, Euro
pe -- or European refugees?
 
A: [laughing]  About half of 
them were immigrants. They're mo
stly from Ita -- Italy.      
 
Q: Uh-huh.      
 
A: You have to understand, 
in a town of 5,000 wh ere we're a railroad, that includes 
workers on the railroad that laid
 the ties, laid the track and 
so on so forth.      
 
Q: You know some towns -- b
ecause I'm not familiar with
 the Midwest -- some towns 
can be very homogen ous, and some are not.  
And that's the sense I'm trying to get is, 
"How much were there -- how
 much influence was there?
 How much knowledge was 
there?  How much interaction was there with 
people who either woul
d have been Jewish, 
people wh o would have been from Europe, peop
le who were different from, let's say, a 
midwestern American?"      
 
A: Well, that's very interesting.  Because when  some new family
 moved in, the first 
question you ask them, "Can you 
play football or baseball or basketball?" [laughing].      
 

Q: Those were the imp o rtant questions?      
 
A: Yeah, you do that, everyt
hing else is fine.      
 
Q: [laughing]  Those are not 
bad criteria actually.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: But -- okay.  So I'll go ab
out it this way. I'm trying to 
ask, "In school, were current 
events talked about?"      
 
A: Current events were talked about, bu
t only  in Europe, not Japan.      
 
Q: Okay.  So in other wo
rd s, you heard wh at was going on in  Europe?      
 
A: We heard wh at was going on, but we tr
uthfully didn't believe it.      
 
Q: Okay.  So this was in
 the 30's  --      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: -- when Hitler comes to power?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: People in your town kn
ew about that.      
 
A: I said "I was told about it, but I didn't  believe it."      
 
Q: And what was it that you didn't believe?      
 
A: That there was a Hitler who was 
killing people and so on.      
 
Q: At that time in the 30's, it would have 
been like political people -- it would have been 
people wh o were opponents ideol
ogically from his regime.      
 
A: Well, Hitler's speeches were on the radio.      
 
Q: You mean you heard them in 
the original German?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Wow.  And were they translated then?
 
A: No, except my mother could speak a little Dutch, a little Ge
rman and so on.  And my 
friends -- some of my friends.  And my mini
ster, whose name was 
Reverend Joe Jordan, 
he could speak German fluently .  And he had 
been in World War I.  
So he pretty mu ch 
kept us up to speed.  He said -- again, I repe
at -- I did not believe that this was actually 
happening.      
 
Q: Yeah, okay.  Okay.      
 

A: And you have to understand 
that I was raised in an isolationist atmosphere.      
 
Q: That's w h at I wanted to get at too.      
 
A: Yeah.  The answer is that "We did not 
believe in being invol
ved in other people's 
wars."  Let Hitler do what he's going to do in
 Europe and so on so  forth, but we're not 
going to  be involved .      
 
Q: That was a widespread feeling in the town?      
 
A: That was very widespread.      
 
Q: Was it something that you took for gr
anted as the right way to be?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Did th at change for you at any point?      
 
A: Pearl Harbor when I was a 
freshman in college.      
 
Q: What college did you go into?      
 
A: It's funny, because I went to Indiana Un
iversity on a full scholar
ship.  But then my 
father was transferred from Ga
rrett to Buchanan, West Virg
inia.  So I transferred to 
University of West Virginia, an
d my  sister did too.      
 
Q: And she was going to college as well?      
 
A: She was a sophomore in college.      
 
Q: What?      
 
A: She was a first semester junior when I was 
a first semester freshman at Indiana.      
 
Q: That's p retty -- that's
 quite an accomplishment for 
a poor family.      
 
A: That's v ery unusual.  In my high school 
class, I think either two or maybe three went 
to school --      
 
Q: -- beyond --      
 
A: -- went to college.  In fact, one of them 
went to nurse's school.  So mebody else went 
to college. There's only three of us that went 
to college.  The point being is that you could 
walk down to B & O Railroad and get a j
ob instantaneously.  There was really no 
advantage of going to colle
ge -- financially.      
 
Q: Well, by the time y ou finished.  Because, wh
en you started, it w as sti ll a de pression.  
When  did jobs come up again?      
 

A: Well, the answer is that the B & O -- 
the B & O did not do mu ch  hiring during the 
Depression, but there were jobs for kids, whic
h paid, you know, $3.00 or $4.00 an hour.  
Now, it was way below -- what was 
th e mi n imu m wag e th en ?      
 
Q: Yeah, it probably  would have been way less than $3 or $4.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: So it couldn't  support a family, but it could employ a kid.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: So you're saying there wasn't
 that much incentiv
e to going on to co
llege because there 
was this choice.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay.  Still --      
 
A: And, in addition to that, 
a fair number of kids' family 
lived on a farm.  Indiana -- 
northern Indiana is a big farm area.      
 
Q: So they were need
ed at home?      
 
A: They were needed at home,
 and they made their -- all ha
d money.  The farm kids all 
were financially stable, because they -- what th
ey did was, they woul
d bring in a pig or a 
cow and get credit for it at the grocery store 
for a long period of time.  So those kids 
could take me and go into these grocery stor
es and always get a candy bar on a trade-type 
thing.      
 
Q: And did they?
 
A: Yeah, they sure did.      
 
Q: Did you feel the difference between yours
elf being from a not so well-to-do family 
and the other kids or not so mu ch?      
 
A: There was zero feeling -- zero feeling as 
far as wealth was concerned.      
 
Q: As far as what?      
 
A: Wealth -- money was concerned.  
No one had mu ch  money.      
 
Q: Okay.  But I go back to it.
  It still is quite unusual and 
quite impressive that the two 
children in one family that is not so we
ll-to-do end up going to college.      
 
A: Yeah?      
 
Q: What do you attribute that to?      
 

A: My grandfather paid for my sister.      
 
Q: I see.  S o  education was something that 
was valued not only by 
your father but by his 
father.      
 
A: Yeah.  No -- by my mo
ther's father.      
 
Q: Uh-huh -- by your mother's father.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: I see.      
 
Q: And, when you were a freshman at -- was it
 in Indiana or West Virginia when Pearl 
Harbor happened?      
 
A: I was in Indiana University.  It was the 
idea that I was going to stay there for four 
years and graduate --      
 
Q: I see.      
 
A: -- on an athlete's scholarship.      
 
Q: And you transferred to West Vi
rginia at what point?      
 
A: At the end of my freshman year.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: So do you remember where you were 
when Pearl Harbor happened?      
 
A: Yes, I do remember where I was.  I was --
 I was with a group of
 friends, and we -- not 
a single soul had any idea where Pearl Harbor was located.      
 
Q: How did you hear ab out it?  How did you 
hear about the fact that Pearl Harbor is 
attacked?      
 
A: It was hard to believe, because the Japane
se capability was absolu tely unknown.      
 
Q: So was it through the radio?  Was it through 
newspapers?  Was it word  of mouth?      
 
A: It was radio.      
 
Q: Radio.  It must have been quite a shock.      
 
A: But then what happened, of course, was that
 -- that meant that the 
boys in school, a lot 
of them immediately volunteered for the serv
ice.  I stayed for another year before I 
volunteered.
 

Q: And, when you volunteered, you
 were already in West Virgin
ia; is this correct?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  Did you want to vo
lunteer right away?      
 
A: Oh, yes.  I was in ROTC, and I had my ch
oice of staying fo r two 
mo re years and being 
a lieutenant or going right now and just ma
ke my way in in the military.      
 
Q: And so, if you were in RO
TC and you delayed at
 least that one year, did that make a 
difference?      
 
A: It made a difference in my
 ability as enlisted personnel in the army, because I knew an 
awful lot.  I was already ed
ucated militarily.      
 
Q: So in that year -- the one year that 
you were attending scho
ol -- what were you 
studying in addition to ROTC?      
 
A: My plan was to be a doctor.  I was in pre-med.      
 
Q: Wow -- wow.  And why did you finally th
en sign up after only one year rather than 
two?      
 
A: I just felt that I should participate.  Most
 of my  friends were in the process of going to 
the military  or being in the military.  It ju
st seemed like the th
ing to do.      
 
Q: Did you talk about it at hom
e with your family?      
 
A: My dad was dead-set
 against it.      
 
Q: Why?
 
A: Yeah.  He did not want me -- he had been  
in World War I.  He did not want me to get 
involved World War II.      
 
Q: And you were how old when
 you signed up?      
 
A: Nineteen.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: Maybe 18.      
 
Q: Yeah.  Well, it's kind of understandable y
our dad wouldn't  want 
you to go to war, you 
know?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: So, when  you did sign up, 
what happened ?  How were you directed, or how did you 
choose one thing over another?      
 

A: I was sent to Fort Hayes, Ohio.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And I remember th e first night -- we were 
in a huge gymn asium-type thing.  It was 
several hundred bunks around a
nd with the snow and so on so  forth.  I didn't sleep the 
first night.  I remember that very well.      
 
Q: I assume that changed in th e subsequent nights.      
 
A: Oh yeah -- I only stayed th
ere for four days.      
 
Q: And what was that place?  Was that sort of like --      
 
A: It was a -- it was a p lace wher
e people got into the military.
 
Q: So it was sort of like a transfer place -- 
you joined , and from there they send you out 
to other places?      
 
A: Yes.  To get your shots, your understand
ing of your responsibilities insofar as life and 
death and so on so forth.  Your NSLI -- Nati
onal Life Insurance comp any position.  It just 
got you oriented into  the army , and then
 th ey sent you some place.      
 
Q: Let me go back a little bit -- I 
want to go back to 
your father being dead-set against it.  
Did he eventually cave, or di
d you say "I'm going to  do it a
nyway ."?  What kind of terms 
did you part on?      
 
A: [pause]  Not very go
od terms.  Not very good terms. 
 But I imme diately signed up to 
send money home to my family.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  From your pay?      
 
A: From my pay.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: In other words, I sign up -- my family
 would depend upon me.  Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay.  And -- okay.  Did things change 
then? You know, did it kind of like, before 
you were shipped overseas you had --      
 
A: I wasn't shipped overseas
 from Fort Hayes.      
 
Q: Okay.  Then tell me 
what happened.      
 
A: Okay ?  I was sent to Camp  Croft, South 
Carolina.  And I was there for two or three 
weeks.  I have a very high IQ.  And th
e army had something called ASTP -- Army  
Specialized Training Program, which was to 
take the brightest people in the army  and 
make engineering officers out of them.      
 

Q: Engineering officers -- okay.      
 
A: Yes.  So the answer is -- is that I wa
s just called up and said, "You're being shipped 
out."   And I was going to go to  Mississippi 
State College for engineering.      
 
Q: Wow -- okay.      
 
A: And I did that for one year.  And then th
e army decided they di
dn't need engineering 
officers.  S o  they just can
celed the program.      
 
Q: But you had then  a s
econd year of college under your belt.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Could you use it eventually?      
 
A: Not in the military.      
 
Q: So, after they canceled, th
en what happened?      
 
A: I got sent to camp.  I got sent to Ca
mp  Sheldon, Mississippi.  In Camp  Sheldon, 
Mississippi, I volunteered for the rangers.      
 
Q: And tell me, what were the rangers?  How ar
e they different -- or 
how do they fit into 
the military , not being a milita
ry person at all?      
 
A: Okay .  There was a sign on 
the bulletin board --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- and it said, "We're seeking volunteers fo
r a classified organization where loss of life 
is very high." And that's -- as a young sold ier, th
at sounds very interesting to me.      
 
Q: Not frightening at all?      
 
A: There was a sign that was on --      
 
Q: Okay.  I'm going to read th
is out.  This is from a pres
entation th at you have given in 
the past and will give again on
 leadership.  It's called 
"Leadership from a foxhole and 
passing the baton of freedom."      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And it is one that you'll be speaking at th
e Elks Lodge in Fairfax, Virginia on May 4, 
2014.  And it's one of the 
slides there.  And for the 
rangers, what the sign said -- 
"Volunteers wanted for a special classified miss
ion.  The risk of loss of life will be high.  
The ideal candidate will be unmarried and 
under 25 years of age and no physical 
disabilities whatsoever.  Expert
 training in small arms an
d bayoneting is a requirement. 
Special skills such as demolition, radio opera
tion, rubber boat hand
ling, and parachuting 

is valuable.  Those interested give your name 
to the first sergeant."  
So of this, what are 
those -- what are the various features -- the 
various, you know, points that they mention 
that caught your attention a
nd you said, "Gee, I'm intere
sted in that."?      
 
A: I thought I could do demolition, the radio ope
ration, rubber boat handling, and -- with 
no problem. Remember, I was 19.      
 
Q: Yeah, and you weren 't scared 
about the loss of life?      
 
A: No, never --      
 
Q: Because 19-year-olds never die.      
 
A: No, you don't think about it.
  But you give your name to
 the first sergeant.      
 
Q: Okay.  And you did.      
 
A: And I did.  And the first se
rgeant said, "I don't have the s
lightest idea what this is all 
about.  Go to  battalion."  I go to  battalion, an
d I talk to the sergeant
 major, "What is this 
all about?"  "I don't have the slightest idea.  
Go to  regimen."  So I walk to regimen, and 
they didn't have the slightest 
idea.  They  sent me to division headquarters, and the first 
time I heard the word 
"Ranger."      
 
Q: Uh-huh.  So even then it was just vol unteers without even 
the word "Rangers?"
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay .  So , wh en you get to division headquarte
rs, this is all in Sheldon, Mississippi?      
 
A: No, no, no -- this is -- where am I?  Wher
e am I?  Yeah, I guess maybe this was still at 
Camp Shelby -- yeah, it was.  It's 
Camp Sheldon, Mississippi.      
 
Q: Okay .  And so you get to th
e division headquarters there. 
 And this is the first time 
you hear "Rangers."  And does anybody
 give you an explanation?      
 
A: They not only gave yo
u an explanation, there were physical and mental tests involved.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So for two weeks I did much
 ro ad marching and to ok tests for mental stability and so  
on.      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er anything 
about those tests?      
 
A: Yes, I remember it very well.  And the 
answer is that there was maybe 100 guys to 
start out with, and it kept ge
tting smaller and smaller and smaller.  A nd so , for the final 
tests, there were ten 
of us left.      
 
Q: What kind of mental tests?  Wh
at did you have to do?      
 

A: They asked -- it was an interview-type thing.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And one of the things was, 
"Are you -- is death a problem?"
 
Q: Is death a problem?      
 
A: Yeah.  Not for a 
19-year-old.      
 
Q: Any other kinds of que
stions to kind of gauge mental stab
ility?  That you re
member.      
 
A:  No.  I remember they -- they asked a lo
t of questions.  In fact, y ou're asking here 
about growing up and so on.  "Why do 
you want to be in the rangers?" 
 That sort of thing.      
 
Q: It was kind of hard  to an
swer why you want to be in 
the rangers if you don't know 
what the rangers are.      
 
A: Well, by this time I had a ve
ry  thorough understanding that
 they were going to hit the 
beaches on D-Day.  They were going to 
lead raids all throug
h Europe.      
 
Q: So that kind of explana
tion had been  given.      
 
A: Yes.  And now, you get down to
 there's ten of us left, and th
ere was the final test.      
 
Q: Okay.  What's the 
final test?      
 
A: We lined up, and I had to be first.  And there 
was a tent about the size of this room.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And the room is about -- oh, 
about 8 x 8.  Oh no 
-- 8 x 12?      
 
A: 10 x 20-type thing.
  8 x 18.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: And I hear "Neighborgall, come
 in."  So I walk in this r
oom, and it's fairly dark.  Not 
very well lit.  And behind a desk
 in front of me is the mean
est-looking guy I ever saw in 
my life who's a ranger.  My first ranger I've 
seen.  He says, "Neighborgall, sit down ." 
"Yes, sir."  "Neighborgall, we don't trust anyone. 
 Put your hands on the table."  I did.  He 
pulled a knife out and stuck it right in between my
 hands.  I was petrified, but I never lost 
eye contact with him.  He says, "Neighborg
all, congratulations -- you're in."      
 
Q: No kidding.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: So that was the final test 
-- "Would you flin
ch?"      
 
A: Now, I thought, "I wonder what the rest o f 
these people are going to
 do?"  So I stayed 
outside while the next guy went in.      
 

Q: Okay.      
 
A: I heard a knife go on th e table.  Shhwww  
-- out the door.  He wanted nothing to do 
with the rangers.      
 
Q: Wow.      
 
A: Of the ten people, three or four of us passed.      
 
Q: Wow.      
 
A: It was that selective.      
 
Q: Wow.  So , by this point, you kind of get a sens
e of the purpose of what this group is --      
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: -- and they have done whatever tests they n
eed to do to see whether or not you've got 
what it takes --      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: -- and what happens then?      
 
A: I get sent to a ranger outfit.      
 
Q: What is a ranger outfit, and 
what did you do th ere?      
 
A: Yeah.  It was new.      
 
Q: That's the dog keepers come by.      
 
A: Yeah.  The answer is that I'm n o w a memb
er of the fifth rangers battalion.      
 
Q: Okay.  How large was this battalion?      
 
A: Please.  No, no -- no, no...      
 
Q: The dog is getting tangled in the wires.  I'm ju
st saying that for the inte
rview purpose.      
 
A: A ranger battalion is 5 or 600.      
 
Q: Okay.  And what kind of further training was there?      
 
A: The further training was in England with  the British commandos.      
 
Q: So when did you go over to England?  Do 
you remember the dates -- approximate?      
 
A: D-Day --      
 
Q: Was '44.      
 

A: -- was '4 4.  So I was in England Febr
uary  or March of '
48 [sic].      
 
Q: Of '44 -- so the same year.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And you had signed up in 1942?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: So we're talking between the time you ship
 over to Europe and the time you signed up 
it was about a year and a half --      
 
A: -- yes, of training --      
 
Q: Of training.      
 
A: -- and most of it was British commandos.      
 
Q: In England.             (phone ringing).      
 
A: In England.  That's my phone.
  My wife will take it.      
 
Q: Okay .  Hang on just a second.  I'm going 
to -- okay.  We can go forward.  So  wh ere 
did you get sent to in
 England -- what part of the U.K.?      
 
A: We landed at Birmingham.  And I don't 
know where we were -- we were part-time in 
Scotland.      
 
Q: Tell me -- before you -- befo
re you got sent ove
r, did you have an  
opportunity to say 
good-bye to your family?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Had you told them that th
e rangers had this loss of life -- higher expectancy?      
 
A: They -- the answer is "no."      
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Had your father reconcile
d by th e time you left for England?      
 
A: Yeah.  But my father
 also got ill and died.  So my fa
ther was not there anymore.  It 
was just my mother.      
 
Q: Oh, I see.  So you lo st him while you were 
in, you know, right after you en listed?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: It mu st have been hard
 for your mother.      
 
A: It was very difficult.  But because of -- I 
was in the army , and of course, they gave me 
the opportunity to
 go to his funeral.      
 

Q: I don't know what to say.  I just can 't im
ag ine -- it mu st have been really hard -- for 
everybody -- for you, for your mom, for your 
sister.  So, when  you get over to the U.K., 
you land in Birmingham, a
nd then do you get transferre
d to Scotland?      
 
A: No, the answer -- we were -- part of
 the training was in Scotland.      
 
Q: What kind of training wa
s in Scotland?      
 
A: Landing on beaches and clim
bing hills. Climbing.      
 
Q: Okay.  Now, forgive my 
knowledge here -- or lack of knowledge -- I thought D-Day 
was supposed to be a secret operation and that nobo
dy knows about it.  Was that not true?      
 
A: No one knows the date.      
 
Q: But everybody knew there was goi
ng to be something.      
 
A: There was going to be a breach of 
the -- of France some place.      
 
Q: Okay .  So it was widely known th
at there is going to be an assa
ult on the fortifications.      
 
A: Yeah.  But, on the other 
hand, we were already fighting in Africa.  We were already 
fighting in Sicily.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And we were on th e mainland of Italy.  So
 that was the -- Roosev
elt, as it turned out 
wanted to go immediately into D-Day -- to go
 into France -- but C
hurchill talked him out 
of it and decided to go through 
Sicily in Italy.      
 
Q: And this is while you're already in 
the U.K. and you're training?      
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.      
 
Q: The beaches that you trained on in  Scotland, 
did they  have the same height and depth?  
I mean, were they simi lar to those cliffs in Normandy?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Yeah.  Were they
 harder to climb?
 
A: Again, I'm a teenager.      
 
Q: Of course, you can do it.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: You can do it.  And then wh at happened
?  How long were you 
-- how long were you 
training in th e U.K.? And wh
at other kinds of activities 
w ere you being --      
 

A: Well, the biggest challenge was the pubs
. [laughing].  But you have to understand 
England, there were very few men there.  They
 were almo st all gone.  So there were lots 
of girls around --      
 
Q: Socializing.      
 
A: -- socializing.  And there were -- the an
swer is the pubs, the American soldier was by 
far the best customer they had ever had.      
 
Q: So there was a great social life.      
 
A: It was very great social life.  "Social" in
so far as you can work  all 
day and drink beer at 
night if you wanted to.  It
 wasn 't mandatory.      
 
Q: But did you?      
 
A: But it wasn 't exactly social.  I mean, you 'd 
have a few beers with your buddies.      
 
Q: Okay.  Did you meet a
ny British girls?      
 
A: I -- we had a dance every 
Saturday night at the place 
where we were, and the British 
girls came chaperoned.  And when ever -- I d
on't know, 11:30 or something like that, they 

all went home.  And, if you were dancing 
with somebody, you couldn't hold them close 
to you; you had to hold them
 out here.  If you got too clos
e, a monitor would go along 
and separate you.      
 
Q: Boy.  Boy, I guess there was a great d
eal care taken there wouldn't be too mu ch 
fraternization.      
 
A: Yes, that's true.      
 
Q: Still, it's not the same thing as being on 
an army base and not being able to have any 
fun at all.      
 
A: I agree.  I agree.      
 
Q: And for young kids away 
from home, you know, about to
 face something --      
 
A: Now, there was one thing th at I shou
ld have brought up 
about Camp Sheldon, 
Mississippi.  The Nesei American 442nd combat
 team w ere also there.  And so, we 
maneuvered against them constantly in the -- 
this is Florida rangers.  So for example, 
Senator Danny Inouye.      
 
Q: Oh, yes -- from Hawaii -- Daniel Inouye.      
 
A: Yes, he was there as lieutenant.      
 
Q: In this -- what did you call it again?      
 

A: 442nd combat team.      
 
Q: 442nd combat team.      
 
A: And they went to Italy.  And they
 were like a ranger battalion.      
 
Q: I see.
 
A: And they  did very  good 
work in Italy.      
 
Q: Did you talk amongst yourselves about wh at
 you might expect?  Did you talk amongst 
yourselves about wh at you were
 thinking of going forw ard?  
Or is it you just, you know, 
paid attention to  wh at yo
u had to do and not mu ch 
talk going on?      
 
A: Not much talk going on about wh
at was going to happen.      
 
Q: Were you scared?      
 
A: No, I didn't -- you rememb er I'm a 19-year-old kid.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: Either -- I graduate from high school, I was 
still 16.  I went to college, but I just went 
to college -- I was 16, but my  birthday is in 
September, so I was in college for one month 
before I was 17.      
 
Q: Right.  And then you went -- and then the fo
llowing year at 18 is when you enlist.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay.  And that's '42.  So, during this 
time in the U.K., do you 
reme mb er wh en  it was 
that you got the order that, "Okay,
 we're leaving now."?      
 
A: I don't.  I don't remember.      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er bein
g on the boats?      
 
A: Oh yeah.
 
Q: What were they like?      
 
A: Prince Rupert.  Prince Rupert was a British boat.      
 
Q: Prince Rupert.      
 
A: Prince Rupert was a British 
boat.  You understand -- they 
went across the channel to 
within sight of the beach in a big 
boat, a fairly big boat.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Then they unload
ed -- load you into small craf
t at the beaches.      
 

Q: And you weren't yet -- let's say, if that 
was June '44 and you were born in 1923?  You 
hadn't  yet had your 21st birthday.      
 
A: No, I (indecipherable).      
 
Q: So you were 20 years old, 
and you hit the beach.  And is there anything you want to 
tell me about that?      
 
A: Not a thing.  I don't want to talk about it.      
 
Q: Okay .  And the reason you don't 
want to talk about it?      
 
A: It would keep me awake at night and so  on if
 I got very heavily invo
lved into it.      
 
Q: Okay.  I understand.      
 
A: I -- after D-Day we joined -- my ranger 
battalion was assigned to Patton's third army .  
And that was before we had all the wonderfu
l reconnaissance capability we have now an d 

satellites and so on.  
Wh en Patton wanted to  know wh at 
was out there, [laughing] he sent 
the rangers to look and come 
back and tell him.      
 
Q: So I'm going to just bridge this a bit 
and say you su rvived th
e assault on Normandy on 
D-Day.  And only one last question befo re 
we go fo rward -- and that is, "Were you ab le 
to sleep at that time after -- after you knew 
you were safe, did you have any chan ce to 
recover?"      
 
A: Yeah.  No -- it didn't bother me.      
 
Q: Didn't  bother you.  Okay. 
 So when you -- what happen
ed -- wh ere did you get to?  
The assault's over. You survived.  Where di
d you get to in France?  Where did the 
rangers get to?      
 
A: It's -- it's hard to descri
be.  They went through a bunch of small towns.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: No big towns.      
 
Q: Near the beaches?  Not so far?      
 
A: Near the beaches.      
 
Q: And then  wh at were your tasks?  What were your assignments?      
 
A: We were a part of Patton's third army . 
 And we were on individual missions.  He 
would send us out there, attack the Germans,
 find out how strong they are, how many -- 
make a guess as to what th
e estimated numbers are conc
erned, and we did th at 
continually.      
 

Q: What kind of missions we
re you personally on; do you remember?      
 
A: They were all -- they were all the same
 type of missions.  The answer is that you 
would go a certain distance 
before you ran into drillmen shooting at you.      
 
Q: So in other words --             (w alkie talkie talking).      
 
Q: Okay.  So the missions were all similar, y
ou're saying.  But I'm trying to  get a sense 
of, if I were on the ground -- or, if you were 
describing it to me in detail, what would you 
be experiencing?  Wh at wo
uld you be doing?      
 
A: Firing at Germans.  And, by the way, 
the casualty list was very high.      
 
Q: From this?      
 
A: Yeah.  You would -- during missions like th
at, you'd expect 50% casualties.      
 
Q: And you got them?      
 
A: Yeah.  50% of us would be
 killed or wounded.      
 
Q: So weren't you scared by this point?      
 
A: What?      
 
Q: Weren't you scared by th is point?      
 
A: I don't think "scared" --
 
Q: That's n o t the word, huh?      
 
A: No, that's because we're highl
y-trained.  See, you're highly
-trained so you wouldn't be 
scared.  If y ou were scared and someone told 
you, "See that guy up 
on top of the hill with 
a machine gun?  Go  kill him."  You wouldn't do 
that unless you were highly-trained.      
 
Q: All right.  I guess what I'm trying to  say is
 that, before you leave the U.K. -- before 
you leave England -- ev erything is theoretical
.  The minute you hit France, it stops being 
theoretical.      
 
A: Theoretical and training are 
the same thing to me.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: In other words, we were highly trained.      
 
Q: Okay .  So  that -- so that th
at's what kick s in -- this almo
st-automatic response, "Okay.  
I know how to do this."      
 
A: Yeah.      
 

Q: Was there any change, though, in you -- 
that you sensed in you -- when  you saw all 
those casualties?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: Did you ever come -- did you 
ever capture an
ybody?      
 
A: Oh, lots of captures.      
 
Q: Any interaction withthose that you captu red?
 
A: I didn't speak German, but some of the 
rangers did.  But there really wasn't  any 
interaction.      
 
Q: What did these people look like 
-- these G erman soldiers?      
 
A: They looked just like us.      
 
Q: Same age?      
 
A: Same age.  Blue-eyed like you are.  [laughi
ng]. Except they're mostly
 blond-haired.      
 
Q: Yeah, not gray.  [laughing]
.  When  did your missions change -- or did they change?  
Did you ever go -- it sounds like you were in skir
mishes rather than ac
tual battles at that 
point.      
 
A: Well, remember -- we were 500 people. 
 And that -- and we 
were never -- and we 
never attacked as 500.  We always attacked 
as 25 or 30 or 40.  So metimes just a couple.  
Before we went into Germany, we came out
 of France and went to Belgium.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And we went into Arlon, Belgium.      
 
Q: Arlon.      
 
A: A-R-L-O-N.      
 
Q: Arlon.      
 
A: Arlon, Belgium.  And the second day we
 were there, while we were preparing to 
attack Germans, a delegation comes up to us
 and said, "We would like to play you a 
game of football."      
 
Q: What kind of delegation?      
 
A: Maybe four, five people.      
 
Q: Were they local people?      
 

A: Local people, Arlon people.      
 
Q: Okay.  So were these guys 
from Arlon young guys?      
 
A: Yeah, "We'd like to play you 
a game of football."      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: We said, "Well, we don't have a football. 
 We don't h ave any capability and so on so 
forth, but we'l l do it."  So it was like seven or
 eight days.  So we practiced like crazy.  
And I was a quarterback.  And we thought we
 were -- we got pretty good at being a 
football team.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: When we walk into Arlon, 
Belgium, we see the first socce
r field we ever seen in our 
life.  "What is this?"      
 
Q: Different football.  [laughing].      
 
A: He says, "Well, look -- we're here.  If you 
explain to  us how you 
play this game, we'll 
still play."      
 
Q: So you were at a disadvantag e.      
 
A: So th ey explained to us 
how you play soccer. The big 
thing is you can't use your 
hands.  That was bad news to Americans.      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: But we played.  And th
ey had about 20 goals. We didn't have any.      
 
Q: Oh.      
 
A: So finally we said, "Look, we'r e here.  Le
t's play American football."  And th ey said, 
"Okay.  We don't know how you play American foot
ball.  Well, tell us and we'll play."      
 
Q: And did you?      
 
A: They did not like blocking and tackling.      
 
Q: [laughing].      
 
A: Every time we got the ball, we scored a touc
hdown.  So finally -- and, by the way, the 
stadium was jam-packed with 
people, and they were all sc
reaming their heads off.  And 
so, finally we said, "This has been a nice expe
rience.  Let's go to the bar and have a beer." 
And that's the way it ended.      
 
Q: Well, it sounds like a wonder
ful thing to happen.      
 

A: Yes, it was a wonderful thing to  happen.  
And by the way, I've been back to Arlon 
since then.  And the stadium's there.  
And this thing is still there.      
 
Q: Oh, I see -- this is a sign.  "The First 
of Novemb er 1944 Footba
ll Match."  And it says 
"Match de Football avec black and white st
ocken le champion divi
sion 1942, '43, '44 
versus selection American."  And I can 'tspeak French, but it's
 written -- there's 
something written in French -- I can 't -- I 
don't know what it is -- but it is a sign 
announcin g this football match.      
 
A: Yes, and it's still there.      
 
Q: That's really cool.  So you were out of 
danger for a while, you were
 able to play for a 
while, and then what happe
ns?  To you.      
 
A: To me.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm -- to you.      
 
A: The rangers -- ranger battalion -- they were eight or nine officers.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And all -- and I like all of them except one.
 And he was what we call "GI."  "Yes, sir," 
"No, sir," "Yes, sir," "Yes, sir" -- you talk 
to him and you're always at attention and so 
on.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And so, one time he comes and says, "Nei
ghborgall, you and I are going on a 2-man 
mission." And I said, "Tell me about it."  He
 said, "You and I are going behind German 
lines to get information and so
 on so  forth."  I said, "Why 
me?  You and I don't even get 
along."  He said, "You're the best man for the job."      
 
Q: Did he tell you what the job was -- 
what kind of info rmation?      
 
A: Yeah.  The answer is -- is
 that we were to go behind 
the German lines and reconnoiter 
-- the answer is "Find out what 
was there and so on so forth"
 -- because we didn't really 
know what was there.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And the way you do this -- 
you do it at night, a
nd you hide during the day.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: So about the third or fourth day early in
 the mo rning, a German patrol spots us and 
fires at us.  And he's hit in the legs --      
 

Q: This officer you don't like --      
 
A: Yeah.  And there were 
just two of us.      
 
Q: What was his name?      
 
A: I have to think about th
at for a moment.      
 
Q: Okay.  Okay.      
 
A: Something about Lefkowitz.  
But anyway, the poin
t is that now suddenly  I'm his best 
friend.  I'm his life and death getting out of ther
e.  It was snow on the ground.  So I took 
his jacket off and put it in and cu t do
wn  two pine trees about this high --
 
Q: That would be about four or five feet.      
 
A: Yeah, four or five feet.  I mean , and I made
 a slab out of them which I can pull.  So I 
pull him back three miles to 
the American lin e.      
 
Q: Did he survive?      
 
A: And he survived.        
     (phone ringing).      
 
Q: Were you able to -- hang on a minute.  
Did you find out the in formation you need ed to 
find out before he was hit?      
 
A: We found out that there were Germans back th
ere, but we didn't comp lete the mission.      
 
Q: Okay .  And do you rememb
er what part of the country you were in?      
 
A: Yeah.  We were in -- in 
Germany and not too far from the 
Belgium border.  That's all I 
remember.      
 
Q: Okay .  Would it have been close to Aach
en -- which is close to the Belgian border, a 
major German city?      
 
A:  Yeah, Aachen was already 
a battle.  But we were not into
 it.  Aachen was a -- Aachen 
was a huge battle.  There were probably 1,0
00 Americans involved -- 800 or 1,000.  And 
not small groups like us.  It was a 
big division-type thing.      
 
Q: But you weren't close to there.
 
A: No, no -- we were not near Aachen.      
 
Q: At that -- I want to pause for a second a
nd switch our topic just a little bit.  The last 
time I asked you about world affairs is, you're 
in high school and you're hearing Hitler's 
speeches.  As time progressed and as the years 
went on and now you'
v e joined the army 
and you were in uniform -- I m
ean, you were in college and th
en you're in 
uniform and so 

on -- did you continue hearing about what H
itler was doing even being in the U.K., being 
in England, or was the news mo
stly about the actual war -- battles here, battles th ere?      
 
A: There was a newspaper called "The Stars 
and Stripes," wh ich was a weekly, and it had 
some world news in it -- but no
t much about Japan.      
 
Q: Not much about Japan.      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: Did you know by the time you got to 
Normandy th at there was a special kind of 
treatment that Jews were getting across Eu
rope?  Did you know anything about the 
concentration camps, about civilians being persecuted?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: No.      
 
A: I told you -- when  I was in high school, th
ere was a rumo r kind of floating around of 
things like this were go
ing on, but I never believed it, and it 
never got much authenticity.      
 
Q: Was there a time w h en that changed?  
Wh en you started to believe it?      
 
A: I didn't believe it until after th e war was over.      
 
Q: Really?      
 
A: I didn't really believe it, because we 
never got into  concentration camps.      
 
Q: So you were never at c
oncentration camps while you were in service?      
 
A: No.  And the reason I wasn't is because th
e rangers were involved
 in it at the last -- 
when I was in monuments bend. 
 In other words, I was pulle
d out of the rangers -- which 
reminds me -- my ranger battalion 
went into Auschwitz.      
 
Q: They did?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Your ranger battalion went
 into Auschwitz?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: But the answer is, 
"They weren't the first 
ones there."      
 
Q: No, th ey weren't.  They couldn't have 
been.  It was the Russians who came before 
them.      
 

A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  Did you talk to the guys afte
rwards, after they went in; was this the first 
time they would have heard anythi
ng or seen anything?      
 
A: Yes, I talked to them -- but
 not in much detail.      
 
Q: Do you remember --      
 
A: And when I said, "Auschwitz," it may not
 have been Auschwitz.  Linz?      
 
Q: Linz is in Austria.  That was one of H
itler -- that was Hitler's home.  His parents were 
buried there. And then --      
 
A: Linz is where Hitler's parents were buried -- yeah.      
 
Q: Correct.  And then Mauthausen was a conc
entration camp  in Austria.  Could it have 
been that the rangers went to Mauthausen?      
 
A: Yes.  The answer is, "When I say 'A usch
witz', I know that's not correct."      
 
Q: Okay.  It's a 
major concen tration camp.      
 
A: Yeah, a major concentration camp.      
 
Q: But you don't know which one.      
 
A: No.  I can't rememb er.  I was to ld, but I can't rememb er.      
 
Q: Okay .  And, when people 
did say they had been  there, 
what do you remember them 
telling you?
 
A: Well, they came up with facts and figure
s -- I mean, not "facts and figures," but they 
came up with descriptions wh ich defied absolute
 logic.  Even  though people had seen it, 
it's really hard to accept unless you'
ve seen it yourself.      
 
Q: So it didn't really si
nk in  with you.      
 
A: Say again?      
 
Q: It didn't sink in with you that mu ch.      
 
A: No, it did not.      
 
Q: Was there a point when  it did sink in with  you?      
 
A: Yeah, after the war was over and I star
ted getting more information.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 

A: The average American did not have a reali
zation of how bad it was.
  [pause].  I mean, 
it was -- it was still hard for pe
ople to accept that something lik
e this could happen.      
 
Q: Yep.  It's, you know, what we're doing now 
is trying to reconstruct what it looked like 
then.  That's not so easy to do
, but it's part of trying to  ge
t an historical record through, 
you know, a medium like an or
al history interview is to reme mb er what you didn't know 
at the time .  That's not so hard -- that 's
 not so easy to do 
when you already know 
something.      
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay.  Let's go back then to -- you know, 
you bring this officer 
back whom you were 
his now lifesaver. You dragged hi
m back to your lines.  You weren't able to finish your 
mission.  What happened then ?      
 
A: Battle of the Bulge.      
 
Q: And you were in it?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: In what way?  What was your experience of the battle?      
 
A: The Battle of the Bulge was a complete su rprise to the Americ
ans -- to Eisenhower 

and so on so forth.  On Christmas Day, I 
was -- in the morning I 
had been on a mission -- 
a reconnaissance mission -- and I came back, and I was laying down to sleep and 

someone came in -- I was in a house, in somebody's house, and all I rememb er is I pick 

up my  rifle and ran to  the window, because I 
thought they were telling me that we were 
being attacked right then.      
 
Q: And what was the actual case?      
 
A: The actual case was that -- there's 
the Battle of the Bulge.      
 
Q: Okay .  You're showing me a slide of the 
German attack based on the weather.      
 
A: This was -- Eisenhower is here.  And he
 put his line right across the Battle of the 
Bulg e and divided the responsib
ility between Patton in  the south an d Montgomery in the 
north.  So British troops here were under Pa
tton. American troops
 up here were under 
Montgomery.      
 
Q: Isn 't that interesting.  You know -- a sw
itch, that British troops would be under an 
American general.      
 
A: But that was only because he had 
to have some responsibility.      
 
Q: Where were you on this map?      
 

A: Down here.  And we were -- the third ar
my was attacking east. 
 When Patton got the 
mission of th is, he mo ved ab
out 100,000 people from attackin
g east to attacking north .  
And the weather was bad.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: It was snowing and so on so  forth. 
 And right there is Bastogne.      
 
Q: That's right.  I see Bastogne.      
 
A: And we captured that.      
 
Q: And you were part of the group that did?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And there's where I got into -- I rode a tank.      
 
Q: Is that you on the tank?      
 
A: That's n o t this one.  It's a ta
nk like that that I was on.      
 
Q: Okay.  And here we have a photo of -- 
of looking like we're going th rough forests and 
really heavy snow on th e fi
r trees and heavy snow on 
the tank itself. It looks like 
blizzardy weather conditions.  Miserable, in other words.  Miserable.      
 
A: Yes.  And so meone said, "That couldn't  have
 been very comfortable."  And I said, "It's 
better than walking."      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: Now, something unusual happened.      
 
Q: What happened?      
 
A: When the tank I was on got to where th
e Germans were firing at us --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- we jumped off the tank.  And I jumped 
off and put my  weapon 
up to my -- to start 
firing.  And I was with my friend Bill Pretty
[?], and the first th
ing I noticed was my 
weapon had stuck to my  cheek.      
 
Q: [sucking in a breath of surprise].      
 
A: So he said, "Keep firing, Roger, and I'll bl
ow on it."  So he blew
 on it, and the weapon 
came off my cheek.      
 

Q: It was that cold.      
 
A: It was that cold.  Yeah.      
 
Q: Wow.  Wow.
 
A: Okay.  Here we go.      
 
Q: Okay.  So here we are.  This is a 
continuation of the Un ited States Holo caust 
Memorial Museum interview w
ith Roger Neighborgall.  And did I -- I say that correctly, 
yes?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And we were talking 
about the Battle of the Bulge and how --      
 
A: Yeah.  And when the Battle 
of the Bulge was over, we lost 60% of our people.      
 
Q: The Rangers?      
 
A: The Rangers lost 60%.      
 
Q: That's a huge loss.      
 
A: So we were training recruits back behi
nd the lines.  And we'r
e walking down this 
country road, which is lik
e three miles behind the front lines --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- and this jeep comes right up and stops 
beside me, and th ere's Patton in the front 
seat.  And he tells the guy in front of me.  
And I hear the whole conversation.  He says, 
"Son, what outfit is this?"  He says, "Sir, th
is is your shift regular time."  He says, "I 
know that, but what the fuck ar
e you doing back here?" He sa
id, "The war's up that way."  
[laughing].
 
Q: [laughing].  Oh God.      
 
A: And my friend in front of me said, "Sir, 
we 'r e training recruits.  We lost 60% of the 
people in the Battle of the Bulge, and we no
w are training recruits."
 And he said, "You 
can train people in th e front line as well as you can train them back here."      
 
Q: Oh my.      
 
A: And so, they drove off.  Th
at was my conversation with Pa
tton.  And that night we got 
sent back to the front line to 
do our training there.      
 
Q: So he issued an order.  
It wasn't like he was in a ba
d mood and drove by.      
 
A: No.      
 

Q: No?  He got your back there, huh?      
 
A: [laughing].      
 
Q: So what was it like training 
at the front lines?      
 
A: Well, the front lines -- the front lines were 
-- it wasn 't like a line -- 
solid line of people.  
It was people here, there, and so on so forth.
  So the an swer is that, "We kept training, 
and we kept -- we did missions as we normally do."      
 
Q: Okay.  At this point -- remind me again, 
the Battle of the Bulge 
was fought in what 
time?  It w as the Christmas of '44.
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And how long did 
it last?      
 
A: Lasted about ten days.      
 
Q: Okay.  So you were in 
early January '45.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And then you 're tr a ining
 these recruits.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And so we're talking Janua
ry, early February.      
 
A: Yeah -- yeah, yeah.      
 
Q: What happens to you then?  How do
 things progress for you?      
 
A: Well, the ranger -- my rangers are comp
letely -- we're still at war.      
 
Q: Correct.      
 
A: So we get missions from Patton.      
 
Q: Okay .  And that's the same kind 
of reconnaissance missions?      
 
A: Yeah, same kind of reconnaissan
ce missio n s that we had.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: Recon mission is you go some
 place -- say, you find out 
the Germans are there, then 
you fight.      
 
Q: Easy, huh?  Or easily said.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 

Q: At wh at point does the Monuments Men come
 into the picture?  
Kind of try and bring 
us up to that.      
 
A: In April.      
 
Q: Oh, so you have an  entire wint
er that you're still --      
 
A: Fighting.      
 
Q: -- still fighting.  Okay.  All right.  So in 
April, which is just a 
month and a half before 
the war ends --      
 
A: -- yeah, but we didn't know it.      
 
Q: -- of course you didn't know.  Wher
e were you at that time?      
 
A: [pause]  I think in Bavaria.  Bavaria.  Near Munich.      
 
Q: Okay .  So how were you 
pulled from what you were do
ing to join the Monuments 
Men?  Wh at happens?      
 
A: I got a call to go see the colonel.  And I 
said to my self, "What have I done wrong to  
deserve -- to deserve personal treatment?"  
So I was going to him, and I said, "Sir, 
Neighborgall reporting as requested."  He sa
id, "Go get everything you own, including a 
bag of explosives."  I said, "Yes, sir."  So 
I went back an hour to get organized, and I 
come back.  And I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, 
"See that guy in the jeep over there?" And I 
said, "Yes."  He said, "Go there and report to 
him."  So I go report to him, and he says, 
"Get in, Neighborgall."      
 
Q: And who's the person you report to?      
 
A: He was a colonel in the in
telligence corps. And at this poi
nt in time I never heard the 
word "Monuments Men."      
 
Q: Do you remember his name
 -- the colonel in the in
telligence corps?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: Okay .  So  you hadn't heard of th e Monuments Men -- or you hadn't heard of the 
effort?      
 
A: No, I had not heard of Monuments Men. 
 I didn 't know that there was such a -- 
someone who was interested in
 saving the arts.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: So I said to him, you know
, "Here I am, what do you want 
me to do?"  He said, "Well, 
in the Bavarian area, there are several banks 
that we think have Jewish -- stolen Jewish 

property in them.  Wh
at we're going to do is, we're going
 to go up and ask for the people 
to open the vaults so
 we can inspect them.  But we think they'r e going to  give us 100 
reasons why they can't open the vault.  'I
t's time sensitive, that no one knows the 
conversation', so on so forth."  Then  I'm goi
ng to say, "Neighborgall, blow open th e 
door."  So I had experience 
blowing open till* lo
ck doors where you 
put an explosive on 
the handle.  When it goes off, the handle goes
 flying and the door comes open.  If you do 
that on a vault, nothing happens.  Yo
u're in a learning curve.      
 
Q: Oh my gosh.      
 
A: So I tried several things.  And finally --      
 
Q: So -- okay.      
 
A: If this were -- if this were a door, a 
bank door -- here's the handle --      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: -- I put explosives all the way around like so.      
 
Q: So in  other word s, you put explosiv
es around the frame of the door.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay.  And this was -- when you got -- was 
this as a practice, or
 was this when you 
got to the bank?      
 
A: Oh, I'm in a bank.      
 
Q: So in  other word s, what he was saying 
came happen -- happened.  He went to the 
bank.  People said, "We can't open it."  And so
 on so forth.  And he says --      
 
A: "Neighborgall, blow it."      
 
Q: So you su rround it with explosives.      
 
A: As I said, that was the end 
of the learning curve.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: I tried several things first.
 
Q: Ah...      
 
A: I tried to first of all -- the second thing I 
tried was on the hinges.  If I blow the hinges, 
would th e door open?  The an swer 
is, "nothing happened."      
 
Q: So one fail, another fail, and this
 was the final effort, right?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 

Q: What happened?      
 
A: The door flies off.  Door ju
st goes -- falls over.      
 
Q: And what was inside?      
 
A: Everything you could possibly imagine in gold.      
 
Q: Gold bars?      
 
A: Gold bars.  Gold 
-- [pause].      
 
Q: We're looking at, again, a presentation wh
ich you're going to be giving.      
 
A: [pause].  Well, it's n o t in he
re, but it is some place.      
 
Q: Okay.  We can pause a little bi
t.  Was that -- wait, hang on -- wa
s this flag in there?      
 
A: We'll see that.      
 
Q: But was this in the bank
 vault, or is that just something else?      
 
A: No, I got that in a separate mission later.      
 
Q: Okay.  This is a Nazi flag that you have.
 
A: On the other hand -- let me go on.      
 
Q: Sure.  Go on.      
 
A: We're at this bank in  Bavaria.  That's  yours.      
 
Q: Oh, thank you.  Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And I'm there the two or three days.  All 
of -- the colonel, the driver, myself were 
there by ourselves the first night.  Then  othe
r people came.  And then I heard the word 
"Monuments Men" mentioned fo
r the first time.      
 
Q: When  you say th at you were there the first 
night, did th at mean you stayed  in the bank 
to make sure it did not get looted ?      
 
A: Yes, we did.      
 
Q: So you slept there.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And what kind of German 
officials were you meeting th
at weren't going to open the 
bank vault?      
 

A: The head  of the bank.  The people -- bank 
employees.  In Germany, the head of the 
bank lives in the same build ing as the bank.  
It is an apartment involved with the bank -- 
with the vault.      
 
Q: I see.  D o  you remember the name of this 
particular bank and where it was located?      
 
A: No, I can't rememb er.  He said  it was on the Danube River.
 
Q: It was on the Danube River so
me place in  Bavaria.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And, when you went in, you say you saw ev
erything in there.  So you saw gold bars.  
Were there photo?  I mean, not photos -- were 
there portraits?  Was there art?  Were there 
sculptures?      
 
A: There was all of those -- all of that.      
 
Q: How large was it -- this bank vault?      
 
A: Very large.  It was probably thr
ee times th e size of this room.      
 
Q: Okay .  And again we said this room is about --      
 
A: 8 x 18.      
 
Q: 8 x 18.      
 
A: So about 30 x 40.  It was big.      
 
Q: And the gold bars -- was ther
e any way of knowing who th is 
stuff belonged to?      
 
A: Our job was to open
 the vault.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: Other Mo numents Men inventoried ever
ything.  We did not do th at.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And their goal was to find 
out who it belonged to.      
 
Q: Okay .  So I'm gettin g ahead of myself a li
ttle bit -- you say you st
ayed there a couple 
of days.  The first night it was just three of yo
u -- you, the colonel, and the driver.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: The second day someone else came by?      
 
A: Other Mo numents Men came by.      
 

Q: That's when you first heard 
of "Monuments Men?"      
 
A: Yes.  And th ey joked with me saying, "We'
re all volunteers here -- the first draftees."  
The first person drafted.      
 
Q: Does this mean you were then pe
rmanently reassigned to them?      
 
A: No, I stayed with 
them for [pause] -- thre
e weeks maybe.      
 
Q: So fo r three weeks in Ap ril 1945 you 
were going around with them.      
 
A: Yeah.  We went to half a dozen banks.      
 
Q: Okay .  That was going to be my  next 
question, "How many of these places did you 
open up?"      
 
A: [pause].  By the way, there is a bio.      
 
Q: Oh, thank you -- thank 
you very much.      
 
A: And here's a picture for you 
of my silver star.      
 
Q: Thank you very much.      
 
A: And in order to make sense out of that, 
you need  to [p ause] -- you need th e front and 
the back.
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: This is the bank.  This is the back.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And there's the silv er star right there.      
 
Q: Here?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: I'll take a look later.  I me an, I'll take 
a look right now, but we'll continue.      
 
A: And you got a copy of that.      
 
Q: I do.  Thank you so much.      
 
A: And over here you'll 
see my name.      
 
Q: It's quite beautiful.  Very distinguish ed.  I 
see it.  I see it.  It says, "For gallantry in 
action, Roger Neighborgall."  So did the subsequent places that you went to with the 
Monuments Men, did they have other kind
s of items in those vaults?      
 

A: Well, let me go on to the s
econd and third night.      
 
Q: Yeah, sure.  Tell me.      
 
A: Okay .  At lunchtime, I'm 
kind of fed up with the whole th
ing.  I want to get off by 
my self.  So I get a sandwich and glasses of 
something to drink to 
go down by the Danube 
River.  And there's a dock in front of me in 
the river.  And mu ch to my  shock a German 
fast patrol boat -- German navy -- comes up 
and docks right in front of me.      
 
Q: But I thought this would have 
been conquered territory.      
 
A: Well, the answer is, "They thought I was 
a German in American uniform."      
 
Q: Really?      
 
A: Yes, that's what they tho
ught.  And one of the crew of four speaks English.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: They jump off.  I have the machine gun, and I quickly take them prisoner.  My 
decision is, "What do I do?"      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: The answer is, "I can kill them right then, 
and that would have been
 legal."  But, if I 
take them prisoner, then you can't do anything
 with them.  So some reason or other, I 
came up with the following logic, "Give me th
e buttons off your uniform, give me your 
flag, and get the hell out of here."  They
 thought that was a good deal.      
 
Q: [laughing].      
 
A: [laughing].  So that's the Ge
rman -- that's  the flag.      
 
Q: So th is is how you came to have 
the flag, and that was on their boat?
 
A: It was on German fast patrol -- a river destroyer.      
 
Q: A river destroyer.  Oh my -- and so , you ha
ve the flag from that.  And you have their 

buttons.      
 
A: And I have their buttons.  I made it into 
cuff links, and I have th
em.  And I'll show 
them to you.      
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  So, while the va
ults had gold and art, you had th
ese kinds of souvenirs.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  And that was the second day?      
 
A: Yeah.  It was the second day.      
 

Q: About how many Monuments Men did you meet?      
 
A: Maybe a dozen.      
 
Q: Okay.  And then I go back 
to  my  other question, "When you got to th e bank vaults of 
the other banks in th e area when you were, 
you know, driv ing around with th em, was 
there any mo re different kind of materials in those 
vaults or mo re of the same -- gold?"      
 
A: That was the inventory of the first bank.      
 
Q: Okay.  I'm going to read th
is out.  This is a single Bava
rian bank in April 1945.  And 
you had 23 -- why don't you re
ad it out.  What was inventoried there?      
 
A: This -- this was by memory.      
 
Q: Got it.      
 
A: There were Treasury gold ba rs.  Twelve bags of American
 $20 gold pieces.  Eighteen 
bags of other coins -- gold coin s.  Twen ty-fi
ve bags of German Reich marks.  Persian 
rugs, artwork, and furniture.  It was all ther
e.  But my job was not
 to inventory it; there 
were other people assigne
d to do that.      
 
Q: Okay.  And then the other ba
nks it was similar stuff.      
 
A: Similar stuff.      
 
Q: Okay .  And did you get resistance in the 
other banks, or did an ybody at those other 
banks say, "Okay. We'll open it right up."?      
 
A: No.  Ou t of the five or six banks, we blew
 open three doors.  [coughing].  Excuse me.  
A nd  th ey  op en ed  th e rest 
up.  [pouring a drink for interviewer].      
 
Q: Okay .  No, enough for me -- thank you.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I take it you mu st have 
seen the movie "Monuments Men."      
 
A: I must have seen -- ?      
 
Q: -- the movie "Monuments Men."      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: What do you think of 
it -- having been a Monuments
 Man yourself?      
 
A: I also have the book, Monuments Men.      
 
Q: That's right.  And read 
the book.  So --      
 
A: Have you seen the book?
 
Q: I have the book too.  I have
n't finished reading it.      
 

A: Okay.  There's the answer, "I
t's hard to read." It takes yo
u all day to read -- months to 
read it all. There's a lo t of information there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  But what about the film?  Beca
use most people will have seen the film.  
How accurate was the film compared --      
 
A: The film was accurate, but I didn't -- the f
ilm allowed me to put together some of the 
things I had seen which I didn't really understand.      
 
Q: I see.  S o  it put things in context for you.      
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  And yet, you had heard of the M
onuments Men wh en you were on the mission, 
so you knew the two were alike.  I mean, you knew th
ey were all part of the same effort.      
 
A: Yeah, I knew -- but I didn't quite know [p
ause].  They were part of MFAA -- 
Monuments, Fine Arts, and Arch ives organization.      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: And it was founded in June 1943 as a jo
int USA and Great Britain organization.  And 
it was in the civil affairs branch of the allied military government -- I 
forgot my territory.  
And it was justified United States by the Roberts 
Commi ssion.  And I looked all that up.      
 
Q: So was it that -- how come your tenure w
ith them ended?  Ho w come you were only 
there with them for three we
eks and not longer?      
 
A: I can 't remember, b u t they took  me back there. They
 took me back to the rangers.      
 
Q: They maybe didn't need explosive experts anymore.      
 
A: I think that they thought 
that they -- well, the war was 
winding down, and I think they 
thought they  were not going to  have to bl
ow open any mo re bank vaults.      
 
Q: But I want to clear one thing, just to make
 sure I got it right -- in all the bank vaults 
that you did blow up in  all the places that you 
visited, this was already territory that was 
occupied by the A
llied forces; correct?  It was conquered territory.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  Did th
ey take --      
 
A: But recently.      
 
Q: I understand.      
 
A: When  they got involved in immediat
e -- as soon as they could.      
 

Q: Got it.  So it's newly-conquered, and th
ey -- and they get to 
it right away before 
anything can happen.      
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay .  Did they  take you back  to the same 
place where you were stationed befo re?      
 
A: Rangers had moved in the meantime.      
 
Q: And where did you go then ?      
 
A: It was still in Bavaria, but 
the rangers had moved.      
 
Q: Did you see any military action after finishing?      
 
A: Oh, yes.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: There was military action until 
Germans surrendered.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: In fact, there was some military  action 
after the Germans surrendered, because some 
of the Germans didn't get the word.      
 
Q: So what kind of events were you in
volved  with after -- after --      
 
A: It was the same thing -- it wa
s armed reconnaissance.      
 
Q: Armed reconnaissance -- okay.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And where were you when the war ended?      
 
A: Where was I when the war ended?  In 
Markgraffin, [Markt Schwaben?] Germany.
 
Q: Markgraffin?      
 
A: Which is near Munich.      
 
Q: Did you hear of da'h al [?] 
when you were there?      
 
A: Again, the answer to that is "yes, but 
the details were not very  great."      
 
Q: Okay .  So  you're outside of Munich 
when the war ends, a
nd how does your work  
change?  What do you -- what 
happens to you?      
 
A: I'm put in the army  of occupation.      
 
Q: What did that mean?      
 

A: Right after the Germans su
rrendered, then  there's an army  of occupation.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And the goal is to get as many people
 to Japan as possible.  And the ranger 
responsib ility was to come back home and then
 go to Japan and do the same th ing to th e 
Japanese -- D-Day.  But it didn't happen be
cause the atomic bomb and th e Japanese 
surrendered.      
 
Q: I see.  S o  between May and August 
1945, are you still in Germany?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And what were you specifically doing?      
 
A: As I said, army of occupation.      
 
Q: But your role in it.  What was 
your ro le in the army  of occupation?
 
A: Well, I was in charge of the guard one 
night, and a woman comes up with tears in her 
eyes and says, "My opal, my  opal, my  opal."  We
ll, I went to high school with a couple of 
girls named Opal.  Opal Ellenjer.  And th
ey were German.  So I'm assuming someone 
grabbed her daughter, and she's scared to deat
h.  But she grabbed my  hand, an d she drags 
me around and so on so forth.  Opal is 
her car.  So [laughing] someone --      
 
Q: Stolen her car.      
 
A: -- some one had taken her car and put it in
to a parking lot.  The Germans were not 

initially allowed to have 
automobiles.      
 
Q: I see.  S o  they -- okay.  So 
she wanted her car back.      
 
A: She wanted her car back -- "my Op
al, my Opal, my Opal."      
 
Q: Did she get it back?      
 
A: Yeah, I gave it to her.  I said, "I th
ink the keys are still in it."      
 
Q: So you had guard  duty; that 
was amongst the things that you had to do.  Was that --      
 
A: Well, the answer is that "W
e're occupying Germany."      
 
Q: Yes.  But as I said, this is -- what is it
 that you were doing as
 part of that effort?
 
A: Well, the answer is that, "We had no id
ea whether the Germans 
-- what the German 
civilians were going to
 be doing."      
 
Q: Okay.      
 

A: And didn't know whether th
ey were going to be belligeren
t, whether they were going 
to try to kill us, or what they were going to try to do.      
 
Q: Were you patrolling the streets, for example?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Like a policemen.      
 
A: Like a policemen.      
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  And how we
re they actually?      
 
A: Actually, they were most gracious.  The 
first day he wanted back  was their opera 
opened.  [laughing].      
 
Q: They wanted their opera.      
 
A: They wanted their opera opened.      
 
Q: Okay.  And were you in the same place,
 y ou know, during these months?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: In this -- can you tell me the to wn  again -- Mark something?      
 
A: Mark M-A-R-K graffin G-R-A-F-F-I-N [sic].      
 
Q: Markgraffin outside Munich.      
 
A: Yeah.  It was outside Munich.      
 
Q: And it's a small town or something?
 
A: Yeah.  Small town.  They ju
st have -- that's where the Raiders had headquarters.      
 
Q: And so, you were patrolling the st
reets -- you had guard duty.      
 
A: We were not only patrolling the streets;
 we were patrolling the country.      
 
Q: So did th at mean 'o n foot' or did that mean
 'by jeep' or did that 
mean 'both'?      
 
A: Oh, no -- by jeep.      
 
Q: By jeep -- okay.  Did you have prisoners
 that you were guard ing as well?      
 
A: No, the prison situation was gone -- solved.      
 
Q: Okay .  And was there anything even tful in these couple of months?      
 
A: No.      
 

Q: No.  Were you just wa
iting to go home?      
 
A: Waiting to go to Japan.      
 
Q: And what happened [pau se] -- to you?      
 
A: Well, we had -- we moved pe
ople out of their houses, so we were all inside.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: But we didn't  have any -- there 
were very few problems.      
 
Q: Okay.  So the anticipated
 problems never appeared.
 
A: Never really happened.      
 
Q: Okay .  When  did you get orders 
to go back to the States?      
 
A: To go back where?      
 
Q: To the United States.      
 
A: Well, I was born in May.  I went back to
 the United States in eith er November or 
December.      
 
Q: Half a year later.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Did you go home to your mo ther and sister?      
 
A: I went home to my -- as 
I said, my father was deceased
.  My sister had married -- 
married a guy in  med school.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And I was planning on going back to Un
iversity of West Virginia.  But I was 
contacted by Duke University.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they offered me a full scholarship --      
 
Q: Wow.      
 
A: -- to go to Purdue.  So, inst
ead of going to back 
to University of We
st Virginia, I went 
to Purdue and graduated.      
 
Q: Well, did you still go to pr
e-med, or did you change?
 

A: No, I changed now to econo
mics and engineering. My  
degree is in economics and 
engineering.      
 
Q: Okay .  And so, you graduated Duke, and 
then how did your life -- your career and 
your life go forward?      
 
A: I was highly recruited, and I went with 
a comp any called ACF Industries, which basic 
product was railroad cars.      
 
Q: Oh, isn't that funny 
-- you grow --      
 
A: But the thing they want me to do was ge
t -- was be an interface with the government, 
on government-type contracts.  So I stayed 
there for ten years and had planned to spend 
the rest of my life there.  And we got 
a huge contract from the New York Central 
Railroad -- New York Central Railroad -- and we 
had a big party in th e Waldorff Astoria.  
The day before I was told th
at I was going to be the you
ngest vice president in the 
company. And so, that sounde
d wonderful.  And we go to  Waldorff Astoria, and the 
president and the chairman and the senior o
fficers, including my bo
ss, from A merican [?] 
foundry, and their counterparts 
from New York Central, were in
 the receiving line.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And my boss, for reasons never known, goo
sed -- goosed the president's wife of the 
New York Central in the receivin
g line.  Now, she giggled, so he goosed her again.      
 
Q: [breathing in]  Oh!      
 
A: Can you believe that?  The next day the 
president of American Foundry got a me ssage 
from the head of the New 
York Central, "And once that son 
of a bitch is off the payroll at 
the end of the day, I want to cancel my  orde
r."  And that was the biggest order that had 
ever been let in for ra
ilroad cars.      
 
Q: That was a dumb move; wasn 't  it?      
 
A: Oh, stupid!  It was stupid.      
 
Q: So what did it mean for you?      
 
A: Well, the answer was, "I was on his team."      
 
Q: So did th at mean you got let go too?      
 
A: I wasn't let go, but I knew that -- immediat
ely that my  teamster was in doubt, because 
someone else was going to come in who I didn't 
know and I didn't fill and so forth.      
 
Q: Right.  Right.      
 
A: So his two deputies -- I was on
e of them -- moved on.      
 

Q: Before we go to that, you left -- you left
 the Un ited States as a ranger, as a 19-year-
old, okay ?  And you come b
ack as a 21-, 22-year-old -- so
mething like that?      
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: How did you chan ge in those years?  Or
 did you change in those years?      
 
A: My first answer was, "I didn't change at 
all." I mean, I had experienced death.  But, 
when I went to Duke, you know, the men th
at were there who had -- competed -- who 
had not qualified to be in the 
military, but most of the classmates -- the men were ex-
military just like me.      
 
Q: Okay .  So  there wasn't -- you know, wh en
 we hear now about people coming back  
from Iraq, or even it was just Vietnam War 
-- they came back and had real problems 
readjusting and had real proble
ms; that wasn 't  something that
 you experienced.      
 
A: No, I didn't have any problems readjusting.
  I went immediately  into it.  I wasn 't 
looking for employment.  I immediately had job 
opportunities.  And I sure really feel for 
these guys -- particularly the wo unded warriors.
  And I might add th at there's all kinds of 
money missions circulating around these things
.  I get a runner every month asking me 
for money.      
 
Q: Yeah.  [pause]  Did you go
 back to Europe?      
 
A: In my American -- in my 
American economy ten years, I went to Spain once.  They  
had a fast cargo passenger train wh ic
h we ran copies of.      
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: We wanted to make in this country.  Bu
t then later [pause] -- 
I now was with another 
company, and th ey gave me intern ational re
sponsib ilities.  So I started traveling all over 
the world.      
 
Q: What was the company?      
 
A: Diagnostic Retrieval Systems -- DRS.      
 
Q: DR -- ?      
 
A: Diagnostic Retrieval Systems.      
 
Q: Okay .  And you note in your biograp hy th
at you served as vice president of several 
companies and president of one 
firm for a total of 60 years.
  What was the firm where 
you were the president?      
 
A: What was the name of the company?  I 
had like 1200 employees.  What was the name 
of the company?  I'll h ave to come up with it.  
I can 't think of the name right offhand.      
 

Q: That's o k ay.  And kind of like my -- not qu
ite "last question" but close to last question 
is, you did go to  Au schwitz.  We're almo st done
.  You did go to Auschwitz in 2012; is 
that right?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: And was this the first time you were in a concen tration camp ?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: I assume that by this time --
 
A: This was our eastern Europe trip.  My wife
 and I did a lot of traveling.  We went to 
Chin a.  We went to Japan.  And we went to every place.      
 
Q: So I see that in this easte
rn European trip, which was in 
2011, you were in Berlin, in 
Prague, in Vienna, in Budapest, in Warsaw, and in
 Krakow where Auschwitz is close by.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  Was this the first and only concen tr
ation camp  that you have been  in?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Okay.  I see the Berlin --      
 
A: This is Berlin stadium.      
 
Q: Yeah.  Let's go to the Auschwitz ones.  Righ t here.  I see that in your slide you have -- 
this is the aerial view of the camp and then 
some facts from -- and where it's located.  
Some facts about the 
-- about the camp.  And what kind
 of impressio n s can you share 
with us about your trip
 to Auschwitz?      
 
A: Well, when you're -- looks like.      
 
Q: Of course, when you enter, there's a photog
raph here, which has a couple of build ings 
that are very old-fashioned.  And it has a 
sign by the door "Arb
eit macht frei," which 
means "Work will set you free."      
 
A: The reason that Auschwitz was in such a 
good shape was, it was 
a former army post, 
and the buildings were -- the buildi
ngs were built to last.      
 
Q: Yeah.  I see those things -- the ladies 
and ch ildren's latrine, yeah?  Those were 
photographs from Europe.  The barracks for the prisoners.  Large ones.      
 
A: I took all these pictures.      
 
Q: You took all these pictures.      
 

A: This is unbelievable --      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: -- to be in there.      
 
Q: This was the interior of the gas chamber.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: And then  you took a picture -- or I see here 
of the cyanide pellet chute, that is where it 
came through, and th e crematorium furnace.  You to
ok pictures of those things.  Okay.      
 
A: I would let you borro w th is 
if you send it back.      
 
Q: Thank you.  Thank yo
u very much.  We'll talk about it at
 the end.  But, for right now, I 
think we'r e winding up.  And I'd like to ask 
-- [laughing] -- one fina
l question.  And that 
is -- and this is sort of like a wrap-up.      
 
A: Let me ask you a question first.      
 
Q: Sure.  Go ahead.
 
A: Being a mother of a 19-year-old --      
 
Q: Yeah.      
 
A: -- that sounds like a wonderful experience.      
 
Q: It is.  It is a wonderful experience.  It is, you know --      
 
A: I congratulate you.      
 
Q: Thank you.  Thank you.  
Wh at would you want someone 
like my 19-year-old  daughter 
to understand about your experiences?      
 
A: I'm torn between not getting her mo stly up
set and not worrying ab
out it, to where she 
really ought to understand wh
at happened.  [p ause]  The point being is I'm quite 
comfortable "If she's not going to
 experience anything like this, 
so why burden her?"      
 
Q: Did you ever k
ill anybody?      
 
A: I refuse to answer that
.  I shot people.      
 
Q: Did th at weigh on your soul?      
 
A: In the rangers -- on mission.      
 
Q: Yes, that's what I meant.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 

Q: Did th at weigh on you?      
 
A: You were set up that you either shot 
somebody or they  shot you.      
 
Q: But that's a price that we 
ask people to pay -- to defend us.
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Well, one of the reasons we conduct such 
interviews is so that
, when people who are 
young -- like 19 -- if they do choose to fi
nd out about what happened and about what 
someone's experiences were, they have the 
possibility of doing so .  They can choose 
themselves to learn.      
 
A: Yeah?      
 
Q: Yeah.  Without having
 it force-fed.  So, for that, I'm ve
ry grateful that you shared with 
all of us today.      
 
A: We thank the Ho locaust Museum -- and by 
the way, we were in
itial members when it 
was formed, but I don't think an yone sends 
me a bill anymore.  I don't know whether I 
belong or not.      
 
Q: Well, I can talk to our devel
opment people [laughing].      
 
A: [laughing].      
 
Q: So I'm going to say at this point that
 this concludes the Un
ited States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview.      
 
A: Well, thank you for coming.      
 
Q: From -- with Mr. Roger Neig hborgall on May 2, 
2014.  Thank you very much.
