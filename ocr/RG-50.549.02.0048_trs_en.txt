Q: You don™t have to tell me  any gossip, 
okay, let me -- Unite
d States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collecti
on, this is an interview with Mr. Kurt 
Thomas, conducted by Arwi
n Donohue, on June 22
nd
 -- 
A: 23
rd
. 
Q: -- is it the 23
rd
, I™m sorry. June 23
rd
, 1999, and this is a fo
llow up interview to an 
interview conducted with 
Mr. Thomas, by the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial 
Museum, on videotape. This is tape number on
e, side A. Okay, I™m interested in starting 
with you, this -- this date is a 
very significant date for you, 
can you tell me what this date 
is? 
A: Yes, it is 57 years ago, when  my  parents 
and sister were murdered in the gas chamber 
of camp Sobibór. In the early -- In the early hour
s of th e day, as I know, being there later, 
the whole procedure, how they
 -- how -- how it was handled.  
Q: Do you have a special way, every time that
 this day rolls around 
every year, of -- of 
recognizing that? Do you memoria
lize them in a particular way? 
A: No, not as -- not any specific way, alth
ough I -- I awake in th
e morning, on the 23
rd
, or 
rather on the 22
nd
, already, when I saw them the last
 time , and think of them. I know I 
think of them and of the events, daily, with
out wanting to even, it 
just come into my 
mind, and I am trying to analyze and study wh
at actually happened , and why it happened . 
Q: You™re still trying to -- You™re still questi
oning on that level, is
 that what you™re 
saying? 
A: No, I don™t question any more, I think that
 I have my answers. I think I have my 
answers. I feel that the Germ
an nation was mi sled, and that 
there is n o t only -- there are

two entities who are guilty of mass murder. We
 know of the executioners, it was Hitler™s 
political cronies, who went along 
with him, to eliminate the 
Jewish people wherever he 
could get them. But anti-Semitism was -- or ra
cism, whatever you want to call it, goes 
back centuries, many cen
turies, and the original sin wa
s committed by Christians, by the 
church , which actually propagated , I woul
d say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by 
accusing the Jewish people of whatever was 
convenient for them. 
For instance, up to 
today, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, pr
evails within a large segment of people who 
do not know history. It is kno
wn, for instance, that
 the crucifixion was an act of erga -- 
Romans. It was their law by wh ich they -- by whic
h they sentenced people to death. The 
Jews stoned. And I want to tell you a very in te
resting story. I met, 
a year ago, a lady of 
the name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple
 books, I believe three books. She a foo -- 
survivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, 
because of her English lang -- English 
knowledge, she got a job in 
a little town so meplace in Germany, to help disp laced 
persons, from all over Europe, of different na
tionalities. And she became responsible for -
- I believe, if I rememb er well, for 8,000 people,
 and got a very responsible, big job th ere. 
One day she got -- she was asked by a German 
doctor, wh ether she would co me with him 
to inspect a ward of sick peopl
e in the hospital, which was also
 in that same s -- in that 
same area where she worked. 
And when they entered a wa
rd, a woman attacked her 
verbally and physically in Po lish, and told  he
r, ﬁYou are Jewish, you sh
ould not be alive. 
You killed Christ.ﬂ With this 
one sentence, this Polish woma
n told the whole story. The 
curse on the Jewish people, wh ich is a historical injustice, carryi
ng on th rough centuries, 
which culminated this time in 
the Holocaust, but there were
 many events prior to that.

You can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at
 individual abuses of führer, masters in 
Europe, in Russia, all over. Wh
erever Christianity was the 
main religion. And never was 
anything done on th e side of th
e church, to dispel these wro
ng ru mo rs, even up to today. 
Whatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough. I think the church owes us 
an apology. They  should -- stop it, please -- 
they should  admit, confess, and atone for 
what they have done. I think this is what th
ey  owe us, and it would also elevate the mo ral 
standing of the church , which up to today is
 only hiding and el -- and not coming out s -- 

directly of what happened. Th
ere™s another interesting thi
ng which came into my mind. 
Protestantism was founded in
 Germany at least, by Mar
tin Luther. Martin Luther 
originally protested against the abuses of th
e church , by being bought off for money, and 
ultimately was the founder of the Protestant
 movement in Germany. Although he was 
sensitive to what the abuses of the church, 
he took with him the anti-Semitism of the 

church, by putting his feces on the church, I 
believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for 
the banishment of the Jews unless they became
 Christians, and of their -- of killing them, 
which is very interesting, and th at only sh 
-- tells me how great and how deep the belief 

of the Jewish guilt was implanted in not 
only the population, but also among the 
intellectuals of the church itself. 

Q: Let me ask you something.
 You™ve been  living in  a Christian country in  the United 
States, for the last 50 years. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you feel that there™s a danger of so
mething like what happen
ed during World War 
Two, in Europe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
6 
 
 
A: No, no. 
Q: -- to the Jews again? Do you
 feel that anti-Semitism is -- 
A: I -- I do not believe that anything like th at
 would be possible again, and I want to 

emphasize today, in my  own mind, a tremendo
us chan ge in government -- in govern ment 

forming of -- of laws. Originally, if a govern
ment persecuted people, oppressed people, 
killed people, nobody interfered. 
At best -- There was an artic
le in the paper, thanks to 
the courage of our President C
linton, and to NATO, that a ch
ange in this attitude finally 
came about, when we declared war on Milose
vitch, wh o was oppressing his own people, 
and abusing the other minoritie
s withinYugoslavia
. This is a historical event of 
tremendous impact for the future
. And I think we should call 
this the Clinton Doctrine. I 
am -- I am highly impressed a
nd very satisfied and happy that
 this happened, not because 
-- not because of my self, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind. 

Q: You think this is the -- the first time th
at something like this
 has happened  on a 
governmental level? 

A: I don™t think, I know this is the first 
time, and never anything
 -- never anything like 
that happened. Even, you have a case here w
ith Pinochet. There is still a dispute whether 
he is guilty or not guilty fo
r killing people during the time 
when he was in power. Now 
they figured out that he is 
guilty now only from a certain da
te in England,
 when they 
reversed their thinking.  

Q: Do you think that -- that 
Clinton™s and NATO™s actions 
in -- in Yugoslavia are -- do 
you think there™s a chance that they had an
ything to do with -- w
ith Holocaust memory? 
Like if you™re thinking back on what happ
ened during the Holoca
ust and what -- what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
7 
 
 
America and the world did not do, there -- th
ere -- perhaps there was pressure on the 
governments to actually take action now,
 in a way that they didn™t then. 
A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people
 might have been influenced by th e tremen -
- by the terrific injustice which happened 
during the second Wo
rld War, toward the 
Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. But generally speaking, if -- if 

NATO, under the leadership of
 Clintons, wouldn™t have done
 wh at they have done, the 
thing could have been  again forg otten. As
 a matter of fact, from what I have been 
listening, to stories about the -- me mo rials about
 the Ho locaust and so 
forth, nobody ever 

touched the church, which is gu
ilty just as much as the Germ
ans themselves, fo r what has 
happened .  

Q: Talking about -- about faith
, and -- and religion and -- and -- and the influence of 
religion on prejudice, can you -- 
can you tell me the role that 
that™s played in your life, 
and in -- in your own sense about -- 
A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religi
on is concerned, I personally believe that 
religions were necessary to raise the standa
rds, the moral standards of the population. 
Whatever abuses happened la
ter on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and 

oppress others, this is a different story. Pe
rsonally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish 
home, by birth, but we were not religious
. We kept a kosher house, because of my  
father™s father, who was a widower. When he 
passed away, in his early 80™s, my  sister 
and my self said, ﬁMom, let™s stop that kosher de
al, we want to eat everything.ﬂ And that 
was the end of the kosher household. Persona
lly, I believe that Moses himself was one of 
the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, 
by inventing the 10 commandments and giving 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
8 
 
 
them to the people as a guide
 for morality, for life. And I al
so am co nvinced that Jesus, 
another Jew, was another very great man, gr
eat statesman, who spread the teachings of 
Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Juda
ism rather than sticking
 to the old ways of 
the Jewish religion.  
Q: So do you see them mo
re as politicians in a sens
e, than spiritual figures? 
A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with
 a political result. And the spirituality is 
terrific, if you can believe in it, and importa
nt is that you should 
then do what they tell 
you to do, what they  wrote do
wn  that God said, but not what
ever pleases anybody to his 
own advantage.  
Q: You were just mentioning a moment ago, 
off tape, about yo-you -- before the war, as 
you said, you were an atheis
t. What did your experience 
in the camp , how did that 
influence your feelings about religion in any way? 
A: Ah the experience in camp only confirmed 
my conviction that ther
e is no God, that it 
is people who make their life, for other peop
le, either nice, or miserable. And anything 
else is just an individual need
. Some people need to believe 
that they will 
go to heaven 
after they die. I believe that I will go -- after 
I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that 
will be the end of -- because I don™t believe in
 -- either in  heaven
, nor in a purgatory.  
Q: Let™s go back. I wanted to -- t-to bring 
us back to th e beginni
ng of your life. You -- 
You mentioned -- Why don™t you just tell me
 what your -- your name was at birth -- 
A: Well -- 

Q: And tell me something a
bout your origin al name. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048

A: My original name was Ticho,
 T-i-c-h-o, which is an old 
family name, which goes back 
into the 13
th
 century, in Boskovice. There were, acco
rding to the chronicle which I read, 
long before the war, but which I cannot locate
 now, and I tried to ask people to find it, 
there were originally, in 1492, that was th
e year when Co lumbus discovered America, 
three Jewish families living in Boskovice,under the castle. Their name was Horvald, 

Stefanski, and Ticho. The-There are very 
interesting things. One of the people who 
survived the war, was Mr. Igna
tz Horvald, who was married 
to a Gentile woman, and he 
was, at that time, when the wa
r broke out, he mu st have been 
in th e late 60™s or early 70™s 
and somehow th e Germans didn™t even intern him,
 at the end of th e war, what they did to 

every other memb er of a mixed marriage. He su
rvived, and he lived in
 the same  section, 
which is mentioned in the chronic, under th
e castle. Now, at my time, there were my 
family Ticho, then there was a company of 
the name Brothers Ticho, wh ich was owned 
by tw o brothers of a family 
of 13 children, tw o daughters 
and 11 sons. They  were not 
related to us, we did not acknowledge any re
lationship between us. Th
en there was a third 
Ticho, Max Ticho senior. To distinguish it 
from my father, Max Ticho junior, who was 
the son of George Tic
ho, who also did not acknowledge 
any relationship to the other two 
Ticho families. During the o
ccupation of Czechoslovakia, there came  to Bosk ovice, 
another ma n of the name Ticho, a tailor 
who lived in  Vienna, but originated in 
Bosk ovice, and then came to Boskovice, my
 father™s cousin, fro
m a little town called 
Switofka, and these were all the Tichos, as
 far as I remember. But I met in Vienna, 
another Ticho, his name was Franz Ticho, 
a tailor, who came f -- or his parents came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
10 
 
 
from Marish-Ostra -- Morifska-Ostrava, to Vie
nna. That is all I can tell you about th-the 
Ticho roots in Bosk ovice. 
Q: Wa-Was your father born in Bo skovice? 
A: My father was born in Bosk ovice, yes. 

Q: Your grandparents? 

A: Also, Joseph Ticho. 
Q: So you -- you would be 
pretty certain then, that you are ru -- descended from the 
Tichos who were -- 
A: I -- I am convinced of that, that my root
s go back into that 
Ticho family, which was 
mentioned in that little chronic.  

Q: Have you been  back  to Bo skovice? 

A: Once, yes, after the Communists left 
-- were expelled f-from the government in 
Czechoslovakia, I went back. I was there. I w e nt to the cemetery, I 
went to -- to see the 
city, I was with my high school chums, we 
had the dinner together -- rather, a lunch 
together. It was a nice meeting. 

Q: High school chums meaning non-Jews, or -- or survivors? 
A: They were non-Jews, yeah, there was -- th er
e were no Jews left. As a matter of fact, 
some 443 people, if I am exactly to the -- 
to the exact number, were deported on March 
the 14
th
 an d 1 5
th
, 1942. Of those, seven came back 
alive. The Hanak family, with Mr. 
Horace Hanak, his wife Greta, 
and their daughter Vera, they 
survived in Theresienstadt, 
because he was maintaining 
the water works, or work 
-- or works -- 
worked on the 
maintenance of the waterworks 
in -- in Theresienstadt, and 
the Germans needed the water

for themselves, is where thre
e people. The fourth was a Mrs. Clara Stickelmacher, who 
had some kind of a job, and surv ived, was fou
r. Eric Brill, who lived 
today in Frankfurt, 
who survived Dachau. Mitzi Brow
n, a sister of Mrs. Hanak, who surviv ed Auschwitz and 
other camps. She is still alive in Bernau toda
y in the capital of Moravia, and myself. And 
I would like to ask you to inco rporate my  orig
inal family name, so that it would be -- it 
would be part of my  name, like
 Kurt Ticho Thomas. Thank you. 
Q: What was it like to -- we™re jumpi
ng around chronologically a little bit -- 
A: Oh, that™s alright. 
Q: -- but we™ll go back and catch things, bu
t while we™re on the subject, what was it like 
to return to Bosk ovice and m
eet all of these people who you 
had been friends with befo re 
the war, but who™d suf -- had not -- you know, 
you -- your pe -- your family had been 
wiped out, what di -- what was that like? 
A: Well, to that point, I want to -- I want
 to bring out a very pleasant yet painfu l 
experience. I came to Bosk ovice with the -- 
with the Czech Legion,
 which I joined in 
Saragura, in  Ro mania in 1944
, in the fall of 1944, and I was home with my  unit on May 
the 12
th
, 1945. The transport stopped on what they
 called the Walhoff hill, where the city 
started. And as we stopped with  our trucks, I 
jump ed off the truck, 
and out came from the 
first house, a woman. And she looked at me, 
and recognized me and said, ﬁWhere do you 
come from?ﬂ And I says, ﬁI fell d o wn from h
eaven.ﬂ And she crossed herselves and run 
back into the house. 
When we were f -- in 
Boskovice for a day or two, the commander of 
my unit, a Slovak mayor -- 
major -- major, not mayor, majo
r, came to me and says, 
ﬁSargent Ticho, I know that this is your na
tive town. If you want to
 stay here, you can be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
12 
 
 
here as long as you want to, 
just join us, our point is Pra
gue.ﬂ I says, ﬁMayor -- Major, I 
appreciate your offer, but I can™t stay here, 
because when I look ar
ound, in the windows 
where I knew all those people, they are gone
. And I rather go with  the unit to Prague.ﬂ 
Q: I think we need to back 
up. You -- Just to remind you 
of where the last in terview 
ended, you had just talked ab out, in you
r video interview, after you had escaped from 
Sobibór, you found your 
way back  to Piaski, yo
u found your way back to the home of the 
farmer -- 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- who had been so  kind to you. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And they  hid you again, and 
-- and you described that you we
re hiding in -- in a pigsty 
or a -- 

A: Yeah, I -- I was on the attic of a pigsty. 
Q: Tell me about that year, or however -- how
 many mo nths was it that you spen t there? 
A: Well, I escaped from 
Sobibór on October the 14
th
, which was a Thursd ay, 1942. And I 
slept in the forest called Sobi
bór. Soba in Polish means an
 owl, and bor is a forest. 
Sobibór means actually the forest of the owls. 
I slept in the forest and the next morning -- 
no, the same evening yet, Chaim Engel approach
ed me to go with th
em. When I say with 
them, with his girlfriend Selma, her name 
was Weinberg, from Holland. I figured where 
they are two, the third one w
ith be superfluous, and I tha
nked them for the offer and I 
went my own way. W -- I -- I was sorry that 
my f -- girlfriend, also from -- fro m Holland, 
and it was Minnie Katz, did not come out, 
and I would like to tell you th e story what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
13 
 
 
happened  before. A couple days before the up
rising, I asked Minnie to get herself boots. 
And she says, ﬁIt™s still warm, what do I need boots for?ﬂ So I says, ﬁIt might get cold 
any time now, please get yourself boots.ﬂ And 
she went into the -- 
into the warehouse 
where the boots were located and got a pair of
 boots. I didn™t want to tell her about the 
uprising to upset her, because I figured, at th
e time, she will come 
back into camp one 
and we will get away together, 
but unfortunately she didn™t 
make it. So, that night -- 
Q: Can I ask you a couple of questi
ons about that before we go on? 
A: Go ah ead. 
Q: You -- You met -- Did you meet Minnie in camp ? 
A: In camp, yes. Minnie came from Wester
bork, from Holland, being discovered in  
hiding, and that™s how we met. She was a 
very well educated lady. Sh e spoke Du tch, 
English, French and German. 
Q: And you were able to
 carry on a -- a courtshi
p with her in the camp? 
A: No, after work, we had a f -- a couple ho
urs, so we -- we -- we spent time to gether. 
But courtship, you cannot talk 
of any courtship, it was just 
th-the be-best we -- we -- we 
sat together, we talked to each other. When
 -- We rem-remembered
 things, and at one 
time, Minnie said to me, ﬁDo you think that 
we will come alive out of here?ﬂ I says, 
ﬁMinnie, my  brain tells me no. My hear
t tells me yes.ﬂ She was of a very nice 

background. She told me that her parents 
sent their money from 
Holland to England, 
instead of going themselves. And I believe
 that none of their relatives survived. 
Q: You lived in -- in camp one
, in Sobibór, is that right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
14 
 
 
A: Yeah, you see, the camp was divided in to f
ourparts. Originally three, later on four. 
Camp one was where the ramp was where the victims w ere br
ought in on -- by railroad or 
through the gate by truck or wa
lk ing, whatever. And also, it 
was the living quarters of the 
Germans. Camp two was the sor
tier section, where you sorted
 clothing, and whatever. In 
camp one there were also all the trademens 
shops, like tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, 

goldsmith. People who work ed 
on mechanical things, what-whatever. And in ca -- camp 
three, was actually the gas ca -- gas cham
ber and the cremation -- cremation, not 
chamber, i-it -- it was, as far as I n a -- heard,
 done on roasts, on steel roast, where they 
burnt the people. And then later o -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: Go ah ead. 

A: It was in 1943, probably in the early su
mm er, when the Germans established another 
work ing s -- working spot, or whatever you 
want to call it, where mostly women were 
employed in cleaning ammunitions of the enemie
s -- of the, in our case, of the Russians. 
That was camp four. 
Q:  Okay . I want to ask you something about that, because you mentioned th e -- the 
women cleaning ammunition -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in connection w
ith the uprising -- 
A: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
15 
 
 
Q: -- and -- and the plans for the uprising. An
d I™m interested in h
earing more about how 
you knew about the plan s for the uprising. Y-You -- 
A: Well, one day, a fellow of the name 
Feldhandler, I forgot 
his first name now -- 
Q: Leon. 
A: -- came -- came to me -- do 
you -- what did you say? 
Q: Leon. 
A: Leon Feldhandler came to 
me and asked me whether I w
ould be willing to cooperate 
in an uprising which is being 
organized. I says, ﬁLeon, I am risking my  life every day by 
cheating on the Germans in s -- in stealing medi
cations and covering up for sick people. I 
will do anything what is necessary, but I woul
d not like to go into any meetings.ﬂ Now, 
for the uprising, they also 
wanted the women to bring ha
nd grenad es, but they didn™t 
bring them the first day and they were afraid
 to bring them the s
econd day, an d so the 
definite date for the uprising was set for October the 14
th
, because a day or two later, 
Sharführer Wagner, the most brutal, and I wo
uld say the -- the -- the 
most intelligent one 
-- not by education, but by s -- by nature, by
 character, was coming back and we didn™t 
want him to be there. We wanted -- wan -- 
wim -- we w anted to do it before he came 
back. So that wa -- that was th
e day, Thursday , October the 14
th
, at four o™clock. It started 
before four o™clock already.  
Q: Let me ask you this. I had been readin
g in -- in the book 
by Yithzak Arad , are you 
familiar with the -- th
e book on Sobibór -- 
A: No, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048

Q: Belzec, Treblinka. Well, he mentions in 
this book that the -- 
that the uprising was 
postponed, that it was origin
ally  planned fo r October 13
th
, and it was postponed for the 
14
th
. 
A: No, it -- it originally planned for the 12
th
. 12
th
 and 13
th
, and the 14
th
 and we did it. 
Q: So I™m -- I™m interested in hearing more
 of the details of how -- how you knew wh at 
you knew. Did -- Did Feldhe
l-handler keep  you abreas
t of what was going on -- 
A: No, no. 
Q: -- even though you we
ren™t in the meetings? 
A: No, I did not get any info rmation from a
ny mo re, but the news leaked thro ugh and I 
knew that we are preparing to
 get hold of the -- what they called wuffencummer, which is 
the chamber of weapons, which was a wooden bu
ilding in --  in the what they called four 
lager, in the -- that part of part of camp num
ber one, before you got into the -- that part 
where we slept and where the artisans had 
th eir shops. And once we get hold of the 
weapons, we will walk out like a armed unit,
 and that would ha
ve been the end. 
Q: So it was your impression that the prison
ers in general, knew ab out the uprising and 
that most people were aware of -- 

A: I -- I would say that it leaked through. 
How many knew, I have 
no idea. For instance, 
Minnie Katz did not know, because otherwis
e she would have probably done something, 
and I didn™t tell her. I feel gu
ilty about it, but I can™t chan
ge that any more. And there 
mu st have been -- there mu st have been so
me people of non-Po lish, or non-Russian 
ethnicity, who probab ly did not know wh at 
was going on, because th
e -- the uprising was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
17 
 
 
entirely in the hands of one Ru ssian office
r, and a group of Po lis
h -- other Po lish Jews, 
and they  didn™t trust anybody else. Th
ey treated me as an exception. 
Q: Why do you think th at was? 
A: Because I proved through my behavior th
at I™m not a traitor, that I was helping 
anybody who needed  help and I 
could do anything for him. 
By which I mean -- I believe 
it was in March -- end of March or beginni
ng of April, 1942, wh
en Dr. Subeese, Dr. 
Nink, and Dr. Breslev. Breslev was Polish, 
Nink and Subeese were Dutch physicians. 

Breslev was a specialist for dentistry, but 
he was still an MD. In
 Europe you had to 
become an MD and then specia
lize in dentistry. And th -these men came to me  and told  
me they heard a rumor that th
e Germans will allow the Jews 
to be sick for three days. 
And they  said, ﬁProviding that would happen
, we would like you to  take on the job.ﬂ I 

says, ﬁOkay.ﬂ It didn™t take lo
ng, and during the appelle, Cha
ffearal Fransel, I guess, who 
I testified in Hagen, tw o times and once in 
Frankfurt, I believe -- Frankfurt or col -- 
Cologne? I don™t know now, which one of the tw
o cities -- told us that they are looking 
for somebody who will take care of the sick
. And I raised my  hand and he said, ﬁWhat 
kind of a qualification do you 
have, or how -- how can you do 
that?ﬂ So I lied to him and 
I told him that I was a sanita
ry non-com officer, in the Czechoslovakian army , and I got 
the job. Now since I knew that Jewish people 
can be sick now fo r three days, as soon as 
somebody was not able to go to  wo rk -- prio r to
 the point of course, if you couldn™t be 
able to -- if you were not able 
to go to work, they 
took you what they 
called in the -- into 
the Lazarette, and they shot you. Pardonme. So I wrote down, for instance, Arwin 

Donohue got sick on June the 22
nd
. So you -- w-we --were lega
lly sick, allowed to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
18 
 
 
sick, 22 - 23 - 24. On the 25
th
 and you still were sick, I th rew that old card away and 
wrote a new one. And that™s h-how -- 
Q: How did you thro w it away, did you have to burn it, or did you --  
A: I didn™t -- That -- That was my own -- my
 own invention, my  own set up, nobody told 
me. But it was good that I had it, because 
at each appelle, at noon time and in the 
evening, they counted  us. And 
they knew, as an example, th
at they say are 480 inmates. 
Now, they counted and 
they™ve howd -- only 472. So the -- then they said, ﬁKurt, how 

many sick?ﬂ I said, ﬁEight.ﬂ In most cases, 
th ey accepted my number, but sometimes they 
went to the barracks and all the sick one ha
d to come out, to d
ouble check, and that 
Fransel did it that way, and Wa
gner, he never let them co me 
out, but I had to come with 
him to the door of th e barracks and call the 
name, and the sick one had to an sw er, to 
make sure that there is no ch
eating. Now, through my functi
on, actually, I™d had to save 
my life. There was a fellow of the name
 Leon Friedman, he cames from washa -- 
Warsaw. A ve-very nice young fellow, maybe 
19 - 20 years old. He developed -- but I 
told you this story already. 

Q: Yeah, this is on the -- this is on the other tape. 
A: So why should -- w
hy sh ould I repeat it? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. I didn™t want to interrupt you. 
But, let me see. You did tell that story, you 
-- you, and we™re just kind of 
filling in on a few things that
 -- that I was interested in 
hearing more details about. And one was,
 so you -- you menti
oned about the -- the 
women with -- 
A: Who were supposed to be [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
19 
 
 
Q: -- who were supposed to be -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Was that something that had just
 filtered out in the same way? 
A: I doubt it. That I doubt. 

Q: How did you learn about that? 

A: I found out about that when
 they postponed for the first 
time, th e uprising -- the date 
of the uprising, why it was postponed. Bu t I 
don™t remember who told  me, that I don™t 
know. 

Q: Okay, okay. I had read some
thing -- the reason that I™m asking about that is I had read 
something that said that the date was 
postponed because th ere were a group -- an 

unexpected group of SS  office
rs, from Osova, who came into the camp , and that was the 
reason wh y it was postponed . Do you think th at
 could have anything to do with it? 
A: I ha -- I -- I remember something abou
t that, but I don™t rememb er any more. I 
couldn™t give you any detail, I 
would only made up a s -- make
 up a story, I don™t want to 
do th at. 

Q: That™s fine, that™s fine. Okay, you talk
ed about your escape. I had one more question 
about Minnie. How did the SS and th
e camp personnel respond to  romances, 
relationships, inside the camp? 

A: They were not, at the time -- First of 
all, it was notduringwork ing hours. After 
appelle, after we came back from work  and we are counted once mo re. I don™t know 

whether we were counted after work, in the 
evening or not, I don™t rememb er now. Bu t 
anyhow, we got our co ffee, and 10 people
 got a loaf of bread and maybe some 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
20 
 
 
marmalade, whatever, out of b
eets. That was the end. There was no German with us any 
more, in -- on camp number one. An
d by nine o™clock we had to
 be in our barracks to go 
to sleep, and that -- that was the end. Bu
t say from seven til nine, although I was busy 
with wo rking on people who had cuts, or br
uises, whatever, you know, with  bandages, 
and -- and so forth, dispensing aspirin, 
whatever. That was th
e time when  we could 
associate among ourselves.  
Q: So you -- you had a little bit of -- 
A: A little bit of -- 

Q: -- freedom and leeway in that. 
A: -- yeah, yeah, in that. As a 
ma tter of fact, I would say toda
y, in retrospect, that it was 
the German™s negligence that it 
-- that the u -- that the upri
sing happened at all. Th-They 
were so -- so content with that -- wi-with th
e run of the mill, that that was not -- not 
enough, I would say, diligence 
on their part, for which I am
 very happy, although they 
were still b rutal in killing. But i-in othe
r words, I would say they -- they missed 
something, th-they -- otherwise, it couldn™t ha
ve happened. I mean, it was very cleverly 
put together, how to  -- how we got rid of th
e first of the -- all 11 of the SS men, you 
know. But somehow, there wa
s something missing on the d
iligence, on the -- to find out 
what™s going on among the Germans. 
Q: Another question related to the uprising.
 You mentioned wh en Leon Feldhandler came 
to you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and asked you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
21 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- if you would be involved . 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you said that you -- you were involved 
in being a medic and that that was enough 
of -- of a risk and you didn™t want to t-ta
ke that chance. How did he respond, did he 

accept that? Was he understanding? 
A: He accept it without any -- without any rema
rk. When we -- we parted, we were ver -- 
on a very friendly basis,
 respectin g each other. 
Q: Okay . I had asked you earl
y on -- you described in the fi
rst interview how -- how you 
escaped and how it happened th at you and -- and Otto -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Came to return to -- to the farmer™s 
home. Can you tell me --
 First of all, you 
mentioned that you and Otto 
parted ways. Did you -- Do  you
 reme mb er th at mo men t  o f  
making the decision to -- to go on your own 
way, and f -- and to separate from him? 
A: No, no, that is a mi
sunderstanding. Wh en we arrived, on Monday the 18
th
, on the -- on 
the outsk irts of that little village, Selishkey,
 we set down in a ditch, because it was still 
daytime, and the -- the dusk was coming in . An
d I told him under the w -- on the way, 
under those -- during those four days, the whol
e set up with the farmer, his family life, 
and what I did there, and gave
 him a complete info
rmation. As a matter of fact, I gave 
him even some money on the way that if he wo
uld have chance to bu
y something, that he 
would have some money. I then, when  it got 
dark, I simply decided, ﬁYou wait here, and 
I™m going to find Po charlie™s house.ﬂ And as 
I walked maybe 20 - 30 steps, there is the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
22 
 
 
barn of his estate. So I passed the barn, and 
th ere was the dog, Caesar on a chain, and he 
licked my  hands wh en I came to him, he r
ecognized me. And then  I walked down to  the 
house. Excuse me, I h ave
 to powder my nose.  
Q: About -- 
A: Oh yeah, I stopped -- 

Q: You mentioned you were
 -- you went and, Caesa
r, the dog [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, I went into the yard
, and opened the little gate of
 -- which was surrounding their 
thatched roof house, and lo
oked into the kitc
hen through the kitchen door, where they 
were eating dinner, and on a -- with a petrol
 lamp. And a little while later -- it w as pitch 
dark, it was a cloudy day -- cloudy -- cloudy nigh
t -- a little while later, the homeworker -
- his name was Joseph, opened th
e door and went down the two 
or three steps to the gate 
and left, didn™t see me . And it dodn -- didn™t ta
ke long, and the farmer came o u t on the 
usual routine, to check the 
barn, whatever, and let the d
og loose. And as soon as he 
opened th e door, I whispered, ﬁKoss padashu.
ﬂ That means in Polish, farmer, but it™s -- 
it™s a title at the same time. And he recognize
d me immediately, and he says. ﬁWhere do 
you come from?ﬂ And I says, ﬁI escaped from 
a camp and I came to save my life with 
you.ﬂ And he says, ﬁMarno.ﬂ That means in 
vain. And th en he says, ﬁCome with me.ﬂ 
And -- 

Q: W-Why do you th ink he
 said that, in vain? 
A: Because he probably wasn™t ready to -- to
 keep me. And then, as
 we walked toward 
the -- this stable, the horse st
able and the cow stable, he said to me, ﬁI owe you so me 
money.ﬂ From that you can see what an hones
t person he was. I sold him a suit in which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
23 
 
 
he took a picture with his wife. I have that 
pic -- I have that picture, and I says, ﬁI don™t 
need any money, I have some mo ney.ﬂ And then
 he says, ﬁBut allete samiastish.ﬂ That 
means, but you are alone, with an emphasi
s on the but. And I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ Because I 
figured out right away  if I would have tell -- 
told him that we are 
two, that my chances 
would be even smaller. Today I know that I wa
s thinking of Otto, but he was thinking of 
Emmie, my friend from Piaski, who once in 
awhile came out onto
 his farm in summer, 
and sunned herself on the lawn someplace, and 
th en in th e evening we went back togeth er 
into the ghetto. And he wanted
 probably to know 
whether Emmie is with me. That -- 
That™s where the misu nderstanding, and it came
 into my mind only 
much later. Anyhow, 
we came to that stable. He says to me, ﬁY
ou wait here,ﬂ and went out and lo cked it from 
the outside -- the door from the outside. I c
ouldn™t get out. After awhile he came  back. 
Brought me a bottle of hot -- hot tea, or hot coffee, if you may -- want to call it coffee, it 

was chicory with milk. And the bread, whic
h they baked every Mo nday, for th e whole 
week, but they break
 fo -- they bake one loaf of sw
eet bread, and then I told you, I 
believe, in this story, too, wh ich was a mixt
ure of poppy seed and 
sugar beets and white 
mea -- white flour, while the rest o f the brea
d was rye -- wy -- was 
rye bread, dark rye 
bread. So that he gave me, and he spread on the f -- on the floor, in the straw there, a little 

home-woven carpet and said, ﬁI come to see 
you in th e mo rning,ﬂ and lock ed  the door 
from the outside, and that was 
it. I had no way to get back to
 Otto. Early in the morning, 
he took me -- he opened the door from the stab
le and took me across
 the ya -- across the 
yard in the barn and says, ﬁCrawl up there 
someplace and hide.ﬂ Wh ich I did. In the 

afternoon, when I was really rested, I came dow
n, and later on, Mrs. Pocharlie came with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
24 
 
 
another bottle of hot tea and tw
o big slices of rye bread with
 lard. And that was the first 
food I had on th at day. And she told me th
at at night, partisans 
came andwanted their 
bicycle. So I put one and one together and fi
gured that I told Otto
 that Toidya, their 
daughter, Theodora, commutes on 
a bicycle from Selishky to Piaski, where he -- where 
she work ed. And he mu st have been -- come in
to touch with them. Th
at is my theory, but 
I believe it makes sense. When I came back af
ter the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he 
came back into his native town
 of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but
 nobody knew of him, so he 
mu st have perished during the war. 
Q: Do you think about him? 
A: Yeah, I think about him once in awhile, but
 I didn™t know him too mu ch. He came into 
the camp, maybe only with the last transpor
t from Bialystok, wh ich mu st have been two 
or three weeks before the uprising. There cam
e a few Czech people, he was one of them, 
a fellow of the name Shtasni was another one,
 and otherw ise, I -- I don™t rememb er any 
more. But hi -- While he were -- While we were 
already in the forest, 
he just came to me, 
and he says, ﬁI™ll go with you.
ﬂ And that™s how it happened.  
Q: Tell me mo re about the time that you sp ent 
in hiding. How long were
 you in hiding in 
that pigsty? 
A: I was in hiding from Friday -- no, from Monday, October the 19
th
, until the very end 
of July. And I know it was the very end of Ju
ly, because my late si
ster™s birthday was the 
20 - 24
th
. I knew the date once in awhile, because my  farmer threw up to  me, a paper 
which he bought in Piaski, whenev er he went 
to Piaski. And that gave me the date, and I 
knew wh en a Sunday  was, because there was quiet on th e -- on th e yard. Th-The pe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
25 
 
 
The f -- The farmers did not work 
on that day. So I knew on the 24
th
 -- the 24
th
 of July, I 
believe was a Saturday. I would like to check this
 out that I am right. And on that day, on 
that day, a tank went through the yard, which 
was the way into the fields, and also to the 
main road to Piaski. And I remember beingin the straw there, I hear a noise coming 
closer and closer until everythi
ng was shaking. And I went th
rough to the straw roof and 
looked through my little peepho
le, and there I saw a tank going 
through and leaving. That 
was the 24
th
 of July, I believe, on m-my
 sister™s birthday. I would like to check whether it 
was really a Saturday. And then, a few da
ys later -- then there was shooting, and 
whatever, which I dis -- already mentioned in 
my report originally 
-- in the interview. 
The -- 

Q: Actually, we don™t have anything in  you
r interview on this 
-- on this time, so -- 
A: No? 

Q: Yeah, you -- you [indeci
pherable] into details. 
A: Then I will -- Then I w
ill tell you what happened. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: A few days before that tank already came,
 I could hear far away, artillery sh ooting, 
artillery cannon. Then later on, I could also 
hear machine guns. And 
then that -- one day 
that tank went through and a day later, I believe, I see a commo tion in  the yard  from my  

vanta -- vantage point on the attic
 of the pig sty, from which 
I could see almost the whole 
length of the yard, not what was beyond me 
on the side where the barn was, where the 
barn started, but down there, yes. And there I 
see that my farmer, in
 a hurry, is putting the 
horses i-into the wagon and she was bringing ou
t stuff of the ho -- fro
m the house, to load 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
26 
 
 
it on the -- on the cart. And then 
sudden ly I could hear bzzzz,
 like a whistle, and then an 
explosion, and that was a shar
pnel. And the farmeress stood th ere with a mug in her hand, 
and when  she heard that noise, she crossed he
rself and got really pale and was beside 
herself. And her husband -- and they were a 
nice couple, he came 
to her and he says, 
ﬁThose,ﬂ -- I could hear it, ﬁThose which y
ou can hear, they are 
not dangerous. Those 
which you don™t hear, they can
 kill you.ﬂ By wi -- By whic
h he mine -- m-meant that 
those wh ich he hears, they are flying far aw
ay. And then they disappeared. Now, from 
Toidya I have later found out th
at they spent two da
ys in the forest, hiding. And after they 
came back one mo rn ing, I can hear a noise
, a commotion on the yard
. No, before that, 
pardon me, I-I am -- I am going too far ahead.
 Then a group of Germans -- soldiers came 
into the yard and disappeared w
ithin three or four hours. As 
a matter of fact, there were 
U-Ukrainians among them, mostly Ukrainians
. And one of them opened the door to  the 
shack, from which you then coul
d get up onto the roof of th
e -- of the pigsty, and was 
looking around there wh at™s going on, and 
I s -- I -- how do we say, crawled on my 
stomach to the edge. Luckily, he didn™t hear 
me, and when I saw him, it was a Ukrainian 
soldier, one of those who actually guard ed us
 in the camp. I slow
ly, but without any -- 
causing any noise, retreated and -- back, so that he wouldn™t see me . 
Q: You mean one of the actual s-
soldiers? One of the same people? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Really? 
A: And I can tell you, I heard my -- my h
eart poin -- pounding in ma -- in my -- I 
remember that like today, that
 it was the lucky day, becaus
e that was the crucial time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
27 
 
 
Shortly after that, the Russians came. And he 
then left -- And then 
they left. Suddenly 
that -- the -- got a command and they left. Th
ey were retreating. Then one morning, I 
look out, and I can see a lot of commotion ag
ain in the yard, and there were carriages 
there, with one horse between two like woode
n shafts, with little carts. And there were -- 
the soldiers were mostly women, big bust
ed, short wo men. They
 were Russian women 
soldiers, who now were in the 
yard. And I think th at they disappeared  either the same 
day, or the next mo rning. And then  my  farm
er came to me and says to me, ﬁDon™t come 
down  yet. Wa -- Let™s wait a couple days or 
so.ﬂ Which, I was a --
 wh-which I agreed 
upon. And then wh en  he told 
me, then I came down and left -- or when I -- when I came 
down, we star -- we stood at -- it was around
 noon time, we stood at the barn. And he 
says to me, ﬁYou know,ﬂ he knew that I want
ed to fight the German
s, ﬁthere™s a Czech 
legion so meplace. It is in pon -- Pordales
 Pordalsk. There you could join them.ﬂ 
Q: Stop here and flip the tape, change.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A,
 of an interview with Kurt Thomas. 
A: Kurt Ticho Thomas. 
Q: Kurt Ticho Thomas. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: I™m trying to -- 
A: I think I stopped telling that I came downand we stood togeth er at the barn. And Mr. 
Pocharlie told me that there 
is a Czech legion, with headqu
arters in Communist Poldalsk, 
which is, I think the Ukraine. 
And I thanked him for saving my  life, and I was sorry that 
his wife wasn™t there. And I told him, ﬁY
ou raised yourself a s
on.ﬂ And I hugged him, 
and I left. He had -- Oh yeah, 
pardon me, he also told me, 
ﬁDon™t go through the village,ﬂ 
which is characteristic of the 
situation as he knew it. And 
he said, ﬁBecause, if they 
would know that I saved a Jew,
 they would not -- they woul
d now kill me.ﬂ And by that 
he meant his -- his villagers, which is a
nother proof how deep the anti-Semitism was 
imbedded in the Polish population, generally. Although my -- my li fesaver was an 

exception. And I think these exceptions should 
be remembered someplace, so  that the 
stigma of generalization 
would be punctured.  
Q: Was your lifesaver ever honored in any way? 

A: Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Pocharlie were name
d as -- were -- were honored as Righteous 
Gentiles during a ceremony in  -- I believe in
 Warsaw, on my -- on my re-request.  
Q: Are they i-in yadva -- by Yad Vashem? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
29 
 
 
A: By Yad Vashem, yes, by Yad 
Vashem. As a matter o f fact, I have seen the tree with 
their -- with -- with the little wh
at is it, the little metal plat
e where their names are listed, 
and they  are -- their name is also listed
 among the maybe 15 or 1800 Po lish Righteous 
Gentiles who saved Jews. And by the way, I wa
nt to mention that there are more Jews 
saved by Poles than by any other nationality, 
at least in Yad Vash em, at the time I was 
there. There was not one, as far as I re
me mb er, mentioned from the Czechoslo vakia. 
There might be some, but I haven™t seen them. 
Q: So do you think that it™s -- So often 
we™ll hear about the anti-Semitism of Polish 
people. You -- Do you think 
that that™s exaggerated? 
A: No, it is not exaggerated. It is actually a
nd unfortunately a truth, 
a sad truth. But there 
were a few who were -- very 
few, who had character, who 
had compassion and courag e. 
This is what ven -- was need
ed. You know, the Mrs. Poch
arlie always addressed me 
Mister. These people treated me unbelievably re
spectfully. I did my  best to work  for 
them, but I think in that respect, th ey are an
 ec -- an exception to any other savior.  
Q: How do you -- Di -- Have you tried to expl
ain that to yourself? How it is that they 
came to be the way that they -- 

A: They™re -- They™re -- They  were just 
plain very, very  nice [indecipherable] noble 
people. You know that he -- After I had to 
leave their farm because the Germans gave 
orders at the end of October, that no Jew can
 work  out of the ghetto any mo re, and I -- 
when  I came -- before I came ba
ck, she told me I should hide
 behind the farm, and when  
everything will quiet down, f -- I should b -- I come back out 
again and that we will kill a 
pig and eat pork and cabba
ge during the winter, then in spri
ng the Mister will be able to

work with us a-again. But, in
 spite of that, I went back 
to the ghetto, and while I was 
going back to the gh
etto, there was a Polish peasan
t with a bicycle and he was 
intoxicated, he was drunk, and co uldn™t use th
e bike, so he used it more as a support and 
he s -- yelled to me, he says, ﬁJakog dat ya
desh,ﬂ Jewboy, where 
are you going? And I 
says, ﬁI am going to  the ghetto.ﬂ He says, ﬁD
on™t go into the gh
etto, they™ll kill you.ﬂ 
That was his warning to me. While I was a few 
days in the ghetto, so mebody told me that 
I should come to the fence, to the barbed wi
re fence. And wh en I got there, I see my  
farmer with his horses alongside, and as ha 
-- as soon as he spotted me, he lifted a s -- 
burlap sack and threw it with a heave over th
e fence, and took his 
whip  and he whipped 
the horses to get away. He gave me in that
 sack, I found a lard and potatoes. And if 
anybody would have seen him on the German 
side, I wouldn™t be here, and he wouldn™t -- 
and he wo uldn™t have lived to th e end of his 
days and died of a normal life. That™s how 
cor -- courag eous and loyal he was to me. 
Q: Tell me about your contact with him afte
r the war and -- and what became of -- of 
them, and of your contact with their daughter.  
A: A-After the war, I didn™t have any contact at
 all. I left Czechoslo
vakia at the end of 
January of 1948, or -- or -- or middle of ™4
8, yeah, for England 
and sailed on the Queen 
Mary from Portsmouth, and arri
ved in the Uni-nited States 
on February the fourth, 1948. 
On th e boat I wrote a card, or a letter, to 
the Pocharlies, and fo rgot all about it, until 
Toidya, with who I am still in 
touch, told me that she woul
d like to find that piece of 

mail, but she never can find it. And then I st
arted to correspond w
ith -- with them in 
Polish and in Czech, and they 
answ ered in Polish and then 
later on, the Pocharlies gave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
31 
 
 
up th eir farm and mo ved to Lublin to the dau
ghter, and there they died. And then  the son-
in-law started to study English and from then
 on, we started to correspond in  English. 
Q: Did th e son-in-law study English so
 that he could communicate with you? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Was that his motivation? 

A: That™s what -- That™s what I understand th
at he did it, because of that. Maybe he had 
other -- Maybe he had other re
asons, too, but to me he 
learned English, because he 
wanted to  help his wife to stay in touch with  me and ma ke it easier.  

Q: You mentioned that at first you were co
mmunic -- you were writing to th em in Czech 
and they  were writing to you in  Po lish? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How did you communicate 
to each other verbally? 
A: Polish, because I learned a little Polish 
while I was in Poland, and it™s a Slavic 
language, and I had a -- I think I have some 
talent for languages, so I caught on. As a 
matter of fact, while I work ed on th -- first on
 the farm and then  later on for him, at noon 
time, we took those things wh ich we smuggled ou
t of the ghetto of Piaski, to sell them in 
the village. So we went from house to house 
and we started to talk to the people and 
that™s how we learned a little more Polish.  

Q: Going back to the issue of 
la -- or staying with the issu
e of language for a little while, 
you mentioned in your first in
terview that your -- your father was a German n -- speaker. 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
32 
 
 
Q: And that you spoke -- yo
u learned German in the ho
me and you learned other 
languages as well, and it soun
ded as if Boskovice was -- ha
d a lot of German speaking 
among th e Jewish community there. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What -- Did you speak
 German in the home? 
A: Yeah, we spa -- spoke German in the home
 and I will give you the historical reasons 
for this. Mora -- Czechoslovakia was origin
ally part of the Austrian-Hungarian 
monarchy. And the Jewish people were very gr
ateful to the -- to Franz Joseph, I believe, 
who came out in 1848, with some
 rights for the Jews. And one of the -- one of the strings 
attached were that the Jews ha
ve to go to Jewish school -- 
to German schools, to help 
Germanize the non-German sp
eaking regions. Now, Bosk ovice was about 8,000 people, 
of wh ich there were probably 
350 - 400 Jews. There were 
mo re deported, because many 
came from other towns at the time 
of the deportation, to Bosk ovice. So we spoke at home 
-- my father had only Jewish -- German
 schooling. My  mo ther had German and 
Hungarian schooling, because 
she came from Slovakia, whic
h was under the jurisdiction 
of the Hu ngarians. And I consid ered my self
 a pure Czechoslovakian because my  mo ther 
was Slovak and my father was Czech. I am
 the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and 

survived Sobibór. I don™t
 know how we came to this. Ye
ah, the -- the historical reason 
why we -- we spoke German, but in 1918, 
wh en Czechoslovakia was formed and I was 
four years old, there was still a German sc
hool. But in 1920, the German school was 
closed, and by the way, it was not
 attended only by Jewish child
ren, z -- but also by some 
Gentile children, whose parents wanted them to learn German. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
33 
 
 
Q: Did an yone in th e Jewish -- Did you speak any Yiddish in your family? 
A: No, no. We didn™t talk any 
Yiddish at all, we spoke only
 German, and I went to Czech 
schools and then later on, we spoke Czech at
 home. But originally , my  mo ther language 
was German. 

Q: Was the Jewish community in Boskovice ge
nerally pretty assimi
lated? Did they not 
speak Yiddish or Hebrew? 
A: Nobody spoke Yiddish
 in the community, w
ith the exception I kn
ow, that our cantor, 
Mr. Gross, he spoke with his wife, Yiddish
. And I really don™t remember whether the 
rabbi spoke with his wife Hungarian. He 
came from Slovakia and he had Hungarian 
schooling. Or, whether he talked with her 
j -- Yiddish , I don™t remember that. But the 
Bosk ovice Jewish population 
spoke only German, and ha
d only German schools.  
Q: And did your father idealize Germany in 
any way, or was he 
germ -- did he -- you 
mentioned that he spoke Germ
an, did he also feel -- 
A: He was politically an orga
nized member of the Austrian
 German Social Democratic 
party. We had in our home, pictures of Vi
ctor Adler, who I think was the head of the 
Social Democratic party in -- in Vienna, 
and another one, Shoemayer was his name. I 

remember the names and these pictures were 
in our house and my  father was a devoted 
German S-Social Democrat.  
Q: Was he very shocked by the developmen
ts in Germany after the rise of Nazism? 
A: Well, he was not only shocked, disappoi
nted and -- but what could he do, I mean, 
there were many mo re people who considered 
themselves Germans, or were in the sense 
of Hitler™s, real Germans, and still did no
t go along with national Socialism.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
34 
 
 
Q: Did you -- Did you -- 
A: But they did not -- nobody ev
er thought that it will co me 
to a organized extermination 
of the Jewish people. Nobody 
ever thought of that. As even
 I, I found out only wh en I got 
to Sobibór, after a day or
 two, what™s happening. 
Q: That mu st have been  an incred ible shock. 

A: It was, it was. As a matter of fact, for 
about two or three days, I didn™t want to talk 
German. And I don™t know -- I think I mentio
ned it in my a -- interview in Washington, 

D.C., after I was taken out from the ranks of t
hose who arrived that da
y, around 3,000 we 
were, fr -- between the ghetto from Piaski and Iz
bitsa, they asked for textile experts and I 
raised my  hand and I was taken out. And in
 the afternoon, I was already sorting the 
clothing of those who came with me. 
Q: Yeah, you did talk about that. 

A: But before I even start wo
rking, while we were getting soup, I see there a girl who was 
with my in Piaski and 
worked with me in
 Selishky, on that -- on the estate of th at Polish 
nobleman who fled to England. His name was 
Bertha Collek. The same name  as the long-
standing -- long and well-known  mayor of Je
rusalem. That was Teddy Co llek, and her 
name was Bertha Collek. And her father happ
ened to be the mayor 
in a little village not 
far from Bernau, in Du
mborshitz. And she came to me and 
I says, ﬁBertha, what™s going 
on here?ﬂ And she says, ﬁKurt, be happy that
 you are here. The other people will have it 
much worse than we here.ﬂ
 And with that she left 
with tears in her eyes.

Q: How did you find -- I mean, realizing wh
at was going on, that 
you were in a death 
camp and that -- that you were just being ke
pt alive for economic
 reasons, how did you 
find the -- what gave you the will 
to -- to survive at that point? 
A: Well, you remember when, under Eisenho
wer™s government, when
 Kruschev was in 
Russia at that time, the political boss, we had a 
spy in the air in a -- 
in a drone plane like. 
I forgot his name now. That man was -- la
nded -- I think he was shot down  and landed 
alive. He had with him cyanid
e pills, I believe, to finish his life, but he didn™t. And 
Kruschev at that -- that
 time said, ﬁShtojiott, 
horchesi ott.ﬂ Whatever is
 alive, wants to be 
alive. And that was with me and with all thos
e others in the camp, too. We hoped that it 
will not u -- be us. Gary Powers, I think was 
the name of that f -- of that pilot. You 
remember the -- the thing, no? 
Q: No. Tell me about -- we were just talk
ing about your father and your -- and his 
political orientation. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And I -- I had -- it reminded me of a questi
on that I had. You mentioned that at one 

point, he was arrested early on in the war. 
A: Oh yes, he was arrested and they wanted
 him to inform about the Gentile population. 
Q: Do you know wh at made them thin
k that he knew an ything about that? 
A: Well, he had -- he was close with -- with 
a few Gentile people, and I believe that one 
of the Germans, local Germans,
 told the SS th at my  father might be the one who would 
be able to give them some information.
 The man I think who I have in mind was 

Estelberger. And that is a very, very characteri
stic story. Before 1918
, there were actually 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
36 
 
 
two political entities in Boskovi
ce. One was the Jewish comm
unity and the other one was 
the non-Jewish community . We had our own 
mayor, and our own police department. And 
the policeman was this Mr. Estelberger, who 
was brought in from Au
stria to become the 
Jewish policeman in Boskovice. That guy beca
me a good Nazi, and I believe that he gave 
the Gestapo the information abou
t my father. He didn™t surv
ive the war. I -- I think that 
he committed suicide. He had a daughter wh
o had a son, his name was Alphonse Beçka, 
B-e-c-k-a, with a little hook on the c. Beçk
a means a barrel. Mr. Estelberger forced his 
daughter™s husband, his son-in-law, to be
come Germans, by wh ich the grandson, 
Alphonse, became -- became liable 
to serve in the German ar
my, and he lost his life, 
shortly after the war, in Russia. He paid fo
r being a good German, Mr. -- Mr. Estelberger. 
Q: So your father had a re
putation for being very s -- 
A: My father -- 
Q: -- socially integrated? 
A: -- We -- He had Ge-Gentile friends, custom
ers. For instance, one o-o -- was the man 
who distributed cigarettes for the city and th e 
vicinity and that does -- that was a position 
which you could get only when
 you were an invalid, a veteran after the first W o rld War. 
And that was a Mr. Kosheneck. And -- And Ju
lius Ko sheneck had a reputation of being 
the mo st unfriendly person you 
can find, but he was very  friendly with my  dad. And o -- 
one day, I remember, d u ring the war, he brou
ght a piece of pork to my mother and ask 
her to prepare it for him with spices and pe
pper, you know. And he 
did it and he brought 
it back to him in his -- in hi
s store, whatever. I didn™t k
now anything about it. When I 
came back after the war, I went into this Mr. 
Kosh eneck™s store. And I said hello and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
37 
 
 
talked a little bit. And 
then I says -- And then he offere
d me whether I w
ould need leather 
for soles. I says, ﬁThanks, M
r. Kosh eneck, I don™t need any.ﬂ And then he says, ﬁI also 
could give you hen -- honey.ﬂ 
Because he was a beekeeper, that was his hobby. I says, 
ﬁThanks again,ﬂ and I want to say goodbye, 
he says, ﬁJust a minute.ﬂ And he says, ﬁPull 
out the drawer from that desk
.ﬂ I pulled out the drawer, there was nothing in  it. He™s, 
ﬁNow, put your hand into the opening, and to
 the left.ﬂ And there was another opening -- 
ano-nother drawer, another handle, I pull this 
out, and there were a few jewels which my 
father left with him. That™s how decent th
e man was. There were other people where I 
took stuff of ours, and either got back hal
f, or nothing. Bu t that was the unfriendly Mr. 
Kosh eneck, you know? He had character and he was decent.  
Q: I don™t think you actually mentioned in 
the first interview, what your father™s 
profession was. 

A: My father was an agent. He represented 
insurance companies. He
 also represented a s 
-- manufacturers who supplied -- who made linings
 for the local ready 
to wear industry, 
and buttons. That™s what he did. 

Q: So you were followi
ng in his footsteps? 
A: No, I was working with a friendl
y family, who manufactured clothing. 

Q: Yeah, you did --  

A: A fellow -- 
Q: -- you did talk about it. 
A: And I mentioned that when I saw the wedd
ing picture and the picture of the three little 
girls, in Sobibór, I -- I™
m sure I mentioned that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
38 
 
 
Q: Now that I don™t think you mentioned. 
A: I did not? 
Q: The wedding picture of -- of whom? 
A: Of Ilsa Bruell, my  boss™s daughter, olde
st daughter and Ziegfried Lerfber, who he 
married during the war already.  

Q: Okay. What was your boss™s name? 
A: Karl Bruell, B-r-u-e-l-l. If I didn™t mention th
is, then this is a big omission that is very 
interesting. One morning, wh
en  I went from camp  one, into camp two, to pick up so me 
drugs -- I was allowed to get cotton, iodine 
and salves. As I go -- walk through the lawn 
there, whatever tha -- it was, there I see a little 
pile of clothing. And as
 I got closer and to 
it, I see on top tw o pictures. One was the we
dding picture of Ilsa Bruell and Ziegfried 
Lerfber, my friends. And the other picture was 
of Ilsa Bruell and her 
two younger sisters, 
Ruth and Lydia. And then there 
was that little -- pard
on me -- that little 
pile of clothing. 
So I knew that they came at 
night, and they  were shot  right
 away , of course, and had to  
undress and they left it there. Now, when 
I came back to Boskovice, the father of the 
three girls, Karl Bruell, surv
ived because his second marri
age as to a Gentile woman. 

And I slept in his house and he asked me wh
en he can expect his children. And I told 
him, ﬁYou have to be patient.ﬂ
 I couldn™t tell him what I know
 -- what I knew. He died in 
™47, I think. Yeah, ™46 or ™47. 

Q: Tell me more about th -- your parents. We
 -- We never got mu ch of a sense of your 
relationship with them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
39 
 
 
A: Oh [inaudible]. Well, we had a very nice fa
mily life. My mother 
was the most loving 
mother I could imagine. They 
were tolerant people, liberal
 people, understanding people. 
I had a very  nice relationship with my  sister. 
It was a -- We were a very nice family. And 
we were five years apart. She was born 19 
nine -- six years -- nine -- 1919, I was born 
1914, five years apart. 

Q: And her name was? 
A: Maryann. 
Q: You -- There was something th at -- that 
you had written in a lett
er to the Holocaust 
mu seum that you wanted to mention in  your 
first interview, about your parents, and -- 
and one -- one story about your mo ther te
lling you something ab out crying, do you 
recall? She said -- I don™t want to -- I want to
 hear the story from you, but it -- but it had 
to do with we 
should not let them see us cry. 
A: Oh, yeah. And then, let™s not
 forget about the taw my fath
er was called to the Gestapo, 
to Bernau, and when he
 came back home, at the first in
terview, he was mistreated. And 
he had to co me back one week later, and my
 mo ther went with him. And the Gestapo 
says to -- the Gestapo man says to my wif -- 
to mo ther, ﬁWhat are you doing here?ﬂ Says, 
ﬁHe is my fa -- my husband, and I want to be 
with him.ﬂ And they  kick both of them out 
and sent them back. Now my  mo th er told us in
 the ghetto, when we 
were in desperation, 
we had nothing to eat, we had -- ju st miserabl
e, ﬁThey never mu st see us cry.ﬂ By that 
she mean -- meant th
e Germans. That™s what a person she was. 
Q: And you took that to heart -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
40 
 
 
Q: -- very much. Did you -- Di
d you ever cry for her, or mourn for her, with tears? 
A: I really do not remember. I do not rememb
er, but I probably did, but I couldn™t tell 
you any instance, but I only know that in 1942
, when I already knew -- no, 1943, when I 
already knew that they were 
mu rdered and let -- and -- and ended th eir lives in Sobibór, I 
lit a candle in memory of them, 
which is a Jewish what you ca
ll it? Not habit, a Jewish -- 
Q: Tradition? 
A: Tradition. To light a candle for a deceased.

Q: Tape two, side B, of an in
terview with Kurt Ticho Thomas.  
A: I brought something out here, wh ich I didn™t 
publish yet. In April of ™90 -- ™98, I got 
an inquiry from the directory of the mu seum
 from Boskovice. Among other things he 
asked, he says in his letter, ﬁIn the Czech Re
public with -- with it™s growing racism, it is 
very important steadily to remind what happen ed in the first half of the f-forty -- for -- 

year -- f -- 40
th
 years.ﬂ And I answered him then, 
all his questions, in a 14 page long 
letter. But I want to tell you only what would be
 interested to this in
terview, regarding the 
position of -- of the Jewish 
people. Just a minute. You 
may stop it, because -- The 
magister -- Trimisal Ribel is his name -- is
 th e -- is the director of the museum in 
Bosk ovice. I answered to him 
with regard to the racism wh
ich he is mentioning in the 
letter to me. ﬁIn your letter you mention racism
 and the need to remi nd th e public what 
happened during the H

A: No, but I mean, ther
e is a word for that. 
Q: For the forgi 
-- forgiveness? 
A: Yeah, th-there™s another word. 

Q: Redemption? 

A: No. I -- I -- I™m -- I™m sorry. 
I should have translated  it be
fore you came . . . I -- Yeah, 
ﬁHe -- He protested against the selling and forg
iving of -- of sins and of the general decay 
of the moral quality of the chur
ch. The pure teaching of Christ
™s was his justification for 
the f-fight of cleansing. He left the church 
and became the founder of Protestantism. 
Being -- Being to death -- condemn ed to deat
h by the church, he escaped thanks to a 
German nobleman, who was his pa
rtisan. It is interesting that
 he took with him, the anti-
Jewish attitudes, which were -- which were on 
96 dissertations, affixed to the door of his

church. Through his rabid anti-
Semitic stand, he confirme
d the infectiousness of the 
church . He -- He demanded -- He demanded imme
diateﬂ -- pardon me -- ﬁchristening of 
Jews.ﬂ What do you call it wh-when you -- 
Q: Christening. 

A: ﬁChristening of Jews.ﬂ  

Q: Or Baptism. 
A: Yeah, ﬁBaptism of Jews, or banishment, or death -- or he -- or their death. Maria 
Theresia, well known  for her deep church ordi
nast -- loyalty, gave a order to expel all 
Jews from Prague, only something that -- mo
re than 200 years ago, during a cruel -- 
during a cruel winter, thousand s of Prague citizens left their homes. Hundreds perished 

during th e march, and many mo re hundreds di
d not live long enough 
to come back to 
their beloved town. Christ™s t
eaching of love and compassion 
disappeared. S -- In order to 
save their lives and co uld -- continue in thei
r faith and traditions, 10
 thousands of Jews 
left, during the Spanish Inquis
ition, their homes. Their goal was Portugal, whose king, 
yim -- on whose king promised them haven. On
 the pressure of the Sp anish government 
and it™s emissaries, the king gave up the -- th
e protection of the exirons. The Jews were 
dragged onto ships and brought to No rth Africa, 
where they were sold 
as -- as slaves.ﬂ Do 
you want me continue? 

Q: Well, let™s hit pause -- 
A: The murdering during the Crusades, the H
eersnow affair in Moravia, the Dreyfuss 
affair in France, the pogroms in eastern Eu
rope, have the same  background. My  friend 
Joseph Stanyek, who is
 a Gentile man, writes me from 
C zechoslovakia, I o -- because I

told him why doesn™t he declare himself 
non-Catholic? And he says, ﬁThere is no -- 
There -- Nobody carries an ev
idence of Catho-Catholics. N
obody leaves the church. It 
wouldn™t be -- to tell it to so
mebody, if somebody would like 
to -- to -- to leave. I am a 
born Catholic, which during my lifetime, parted
 because of the behavi
or of the Catholic 
hierarchy, who, in all Czech history, did no
t love the Czech people,
 the Czech nation, but 
rather corrupted it. Sho -- They always -- It 
always went mainly for the power over them, 
and for the -- for the miatac --  for the -- for the -- what th
ey possess -- possessions. Christ 
would not enjoy them.ﬂ Then , I™m writing he
re about Mrs. Rubenstein, who had that 
accident -- that episode in the hospital. ﬁW
ithout the hundred -- ce
ntury old persecution 
of the church -- of the Jews, 
it would not have come to th
e Holocaust. Hitler w as not the 
first initiator of killing Jews. He 
had very good -- a ve
ry good teacher in 
the actions of the 
church. All German governments after the war, 
we -- with -- with a -- with no exception 
of political -- political s -- parties, starting 
with Conrad Addenower, accepted publicly, 
the responsibility for th
e guilt or the tragedy of the Germ
an nation caused by the Nazis. 
They did not express their sorrow, their sincer
e sorrow by words only, 
but by deeds. They 
returned all political rights and legal -- legal 
dif -- off -- legal defense. Former -- Former 
people of German nationality, and their -- and 
their heirs, through 
return of possessions 
and restitution for suffering, and -- and for not 
being able to get educated and for loss of 
health, and through big support 
to build  up the state of Is
rael, defending and protecting 
religious freedom and throug
h persecuting anti-Semitic pr
opaganda. So Germany was 
accepted into the circle of civilized nations. Th

to today. Small -- 
Small -- Small actions 
didn™t have any influence on the thinking of 
the Christian -- Christia

of individual Christians, laymen, priests and

Q: This is tape number three, side A, of 
an interview with Kurt 
Ticho Thomas, and we™re

Q: The voluntary -- 
A: -- ﬁvolunteers who nachanya -- who enth us
iastically supported 
the murderous actions 
of Hitler, e -- prove that anti-Semitism, spread
 by the church, was part of the culture of 
the Christian public. It is nece

y of executing to  death. The Jews stoned.

confirmation of the sincerity of the church™s 
decision, necessary to 
better the living in 
lares -- in respect and in peace. Started in Fe
bruary  and ended at th
e end of April, 1999, 
Kurt Ticho Thomas.ﬂ No
w I got it off my  mi nd. I hope you don™t mind. 
Q: No. Tell me what -- what the writing of 
this letter meant to you, and -- and of your 
process of developing the 
thoughts that are in  it. 

A: I tell you, he actually provoked me, because 
he probably -- he -- he means it well. But 
I want him to know what caused the idea of 
getting so rabid against the Jews, and that he, 
if he -- if he is -- if he is really sincer
e, should tell the other people, wher -- where the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
49 
 
 
reasons sit. It is not only the Germans. To 
th e Czech people, it™s the Germans, period. Bu t 
actually, it goes back  hundreds of years, a
nd the Czech people too,
 were influenced by 
the chur -- by the church, to hate the Jew. Th
at is the reason. And -- And it™s logic. And I 
am -- I™m a person who goes to th
e root of something, if I can. And there is the root. This 
is where it is buried, th-the whole -- the whole 
tragedy of history is buried in the original 
position of the church, and they s
till didn™t do a thing about it.  
Q: Tell me how you came to ha -- develop th
ese thoughts. Did you -- Did you think of it 

after the war? Was it something that be
fore the war you were thinking about? 
A: Before the war I never thought this way. 
Bes -- Before the war I was liberal thinking, 
social thinking, [indecipherable]
 a person of social responsi
bilities. And I knew there was 
a friction between the Czech Catholic and the 
Czech Jew, historically, because we were 
talking German, and there was a certain -- a ce
rtain social envy also, because the Jewish 
people, in mo st instances, owned stores, or 
manufactured, and were mo re educated than 
the average non-Jew. An-A nd so I -- I could un
derstand that, but I tried to overcome this 
also, by spoke -- speaking only
 Czech, of course. And Czech 
history was my history. I 
hated the Germans, because I was taught in  sc
hool what they did to the Czechs. And I 
was one of the Czechs.  

Q: So after the war, did you do some read
ing, or did you do -- 
was it something that 
happened during the 
war that mad e you -- 
A: Yeah, reading and hearing. For -- For inst
ance, as of today, the Czech government 

didn™t return 90 percent of what was left 
after the Jews, only to those who either came 
back, or to their heirs. There are many, 
many properties, which nobody claims, because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
50 
 
 
they were entirely wiped out. 
But they didn™t return anythi
ng. I have a friend here in 
town , whose father owned, with  his three br
others, the largest ready-to-wear factory in 
Prostejov, he can™t get a penny. They -- Th
-They just are stonewalled. I have a friend 
who was born in  Theresienstadt, his name is 
Peter Steinlay, he lives here in town .He 
showed me the picture of his house -- of -- af
ter his father™s, and he went there, and the 
person who lives in it, he says
, ﬁI am not giving it back  to 
you.ﬂ And he -- he wouldn™t 
know wh ere to go, how to get 
it back. There is a -- a-another fellow in Prosnitz, his name 
is -- whatever the name  is, he -- he tried 
to claim a house after his parents have -- his 
father was a doctor -- he can™t get no place. Th
at is all th ere and today when they claim 
there -- the -- when their -- th
at th ey are democrats, bal
oney. They  belong to  NA TO 
today, they never shoul
d have been accepted ev
en, to NATO, because 
they live still with 
Hitler™s and Stalin™s ideas, at least a great pa
rt, and do not give an
ything back, what they 
should have done already, years ago. 

Q: You™re talking about
 Germans, Germany? 
A: Am I -- I™m no -- The Germans 
did, but the Czechs did not. 
Q: Czechs didn™t, okay. You were talk -- When
 you talked in your 
other interview about 
your pre-war life in Boskovice -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- your relations with your Cz
ech neighbors were very good. 
A: Yeah, I -- I mean, my -- all 
my friends were not only Je
wish kids, but also Gentile 
kids. As a matter of fact, I res -- correspond 
today with  the one surviving lady who went 
with me to high school. I am in contact w
ith her. And with a young
er lady who is retired, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
51 
 
 
who I only knew that -- she was a little girl 
at the time when I was grown up. And then 
with this Mr. Stanick in Be
rnau, for whose father I work
ed during the war, when I 
couldn™t work for my old bo
ss, who was Jewish. So I ha
ve still contacts -- Christian 
contacts, and these people are honest, but they 
have no influence, th
ey can do nothing.  
Q: Do you -- They -- So your -- Are you di
fferentiating between the Czech government 
and the Czech people? 
A: Definitely. 
Q: Do you think that Czech 
-- Do you think the Czech pe
ople are more aware, more 
enlightened? 
A: The Czech people -- The Czech people sh
ould be led by the g
overnment, who would 
explain to  them, ﬁListen, these were our pe
ople. Their properties were stole from them 
originally, by the Germans. Th
en they were nationalized or
 stolen by th e Communists, 
and now we are free and we should have th e de
cency to return it to
 those who are still 
alive, or to their heirs, as 
much as they 
are around.ﬂ  
Q: Does your experience with Czech people, 
non-Jews, tell you th at they are accepting of 
that and that their anti-Sem
itism is not such  that they
 would not recognize their 
responsib ility to do that? 
A: No, I had no discussion with an ybody. At 
the time w h en I was there, I didn™t have a 

discussion, because it was too early, the Comm
unists just left, you know, and I hoped, in 
my naiveté that everything will be fine, but it wasn™t. 

Q: Well let™s go back to that time, immediat
ely after the war when you™re -- you™re -- you 
joined the Czech legion -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
52 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and you ended up in -- in Bo skovice. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And your goal -- Was your goal at 
the time, to fight the Germans? 
A: Of -- No, that™s why I joined the army. Th -That was my goal, to 
-- to -- to -- to for -- 
fight Hitler. 
Q: Did you end up in  comb at? 
A: I was with a artillery unit, and they were ne
ver up front. Also, I didn™t feel -- I was -- I 
was sickly, actually. I -- I was -- from all t
hose things which I had behind me, the camp  
and then the hiding, I was -- I was not myself. 
But luckily, I was with
 a unit wh ich didn™t 
go into action, and not 
only that, at that time, the Russi
ans did not use the Czech unit any 
more, because they wanted to
 come with some Czechs home
, because there was another 
unit in England, and they didn™t want to 
come with a hundred pe
ople. And the English-
Czech unit came back with a fe
w thousand, you know
. So th-that -- they -- they didn™t 
want to either. So, for that reason, we were
 somehow protected, toward the end of the ye 
-- of the war. 
Q: What was it like to see again, the to
wn speople who you had 
-- you know, you had 
been put into this gh
etto and -- and herded off. Did -- Di
d anyone say -- Did anyone seem 
disappointed  that you had surv ived ? Was ther
e that kind of experien ce, or did you -- 
A: I didn™t get your question. 
Q: We were talking earlier about 
the anti-Semitism of the Poles -- 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
53 
 
 
Q: -- and how deep that was. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: When  you return ed to Czechoslovakia -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- did you find that these former neighbo
rs, who you had been 
close with, were -- 
A: In Czechoslovakia? 
Q: In Czechoslovakia. 
A: I was disappointed, because there was one 
who was a very good 
Catholic, and he had 
all the silverware of my aunt, who perished in
 the camp. And she told me that he has it -- 
she has it with this fellow. I went to him -- 
Nowo rdny was his name , he said, ﬁI didn™t 
even know your -- your aunt.ﬂ
 He denied ev erything. I me
an, i-it was just -- it was a 
material greed. I didn™t get more than a half
 of my sister™s dowry back. Linens from a 
tailor, who also was a very well known Catho
lic. Kosheneck was also a Catholic. That 
was the guy who had th e -- this -- diversion of 
cigarettes. He told me, and I didn™t even 
know -- pardon me -- that there was anything what
 my father left th ere, because he didn™t 
tell anybody. So, I mean, there were two differe
nt types of people, that the great majority 
either didn™t care, or enjoyed it. 
Q: But here we™re talking about a place wher
e your fami ly had been for centuries upon 
centuries -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- you have very deep roots there. 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
54 
 
 
Q: Did you feel like all of
 that was erased, or -- 
A: Not -- Not -- Not when I came back, bu
t wh en -- wh ile the Communists taking over. 
And then  there was the process against the 
Jews, if you rememb er, they were sentenced 
to death, eight or 10 of them. Honorable Sl
ansky, Rightsin, and  [indecipherable]. Then I 
lost entirely -- I lost entirely my -- my hi
storical connection as a Czech, with the 
exception of the few people with 
who I am still in touch. But I 
disliked the -- the action, I 
-- I abhorred the action. 
Q: Do you still feel that that historical 
connection is gone? Is it gone forever? 
A: To a great extent, it is gone. To a great ec
 -- ec -- a-a-and I™m angry wh en I think of 
the people who can™t get anything back, who ar
e there. I have a friend in California. She 
owned with her brother, a large apartment 
building in Bernau, 
in the capital of 
Czechoslo vakia -- oh, Moravia. The brother 
unfortunately perished, she survived. And 
it™s her property today, because she inheritedone half after her brother. She can™t even 
find a lawyer who would take over the case. Or
iginally the lawyer to
ld her that she has 
difficulties because she became 
an American citizen. Now, th
e -- later on, there was some 
reform in that respect. So she wrote to that lawyer, and she 
wouldn™t even talk on th e case 

any more. It is really miserable.  
Q: How long did you stay in Bo skovice with th e Czech legion? 

A: Two or three days, that™s all.
 A nd then I went to Prague.  
Q: What did you do in Prague? 

A: Well, then I was discharged, in fall I was 
discharged , and I went back to Bosk ovice, 
and stayed with this Hanark family, who cam
e back. And then I got a job in what they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
55 
 
 
called the Sudeten, where my father™s c
ousin represented a manufacturer, and this 
manufacturer happened to be married to a Je
wish woman, and he was still in -- in 
Kernoff, and I went up there and got a job w
ith them. And then th
ey nominated me to 
become the trustee. And I resigned from the job after a short while, because I didn™t feel 
that it is right, that it should be th -- given 
to  the man whose it was in the first place, and 
at the same  time,  there  was some Jewish 
-- an-anti-Jewish grumblings, that the Jew 
became now the trustee. So I just quit. And th
en I -- I went to Prague, and from there I 
went to England and to the Un ited States. 

Q: So, originally, in -- in th
ose -- that time immediately following the end of th e war -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- did you have thoughts that you woul
d stay in Czechosl
ovakia permanently? 
A: No. As soon as I got in t
ouch with my  relatives in Amer
ica, my  uncle and his sister, 
my aunt -- 
Q: I™m sorry, this picked up a -- 
A: Oh, that™s okay. 

Q: -- noise. 
A: That™s okay. I -- When I got mail, they o
ffered me an affidavit again, which we had 
already befo re the war, but the quota was exha
usted, so I couldn™t -- you couldn™t use it. 
But then  of course, I could feel that the 
Communists are taking over, which I hated. So I 
was eager to get out. I got out at the end of
 January  to London, and arrived in the Un ited 
States on February th e fourth and within two 
or three weeks, there 
was the coup and the 
government -- the Communists took 
over the government in Prague. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
56 
 
 
Q: This is 1948? 
A: No, this was -- 
yeah, 1948, yeah. 
Q: And you went to England just
 en route to the United States? 

A: Right. 

Q: That -- It was no plans to stay? 

A: Right. 
Q: Okay. Go ahead. 
A: I stayed there with a man whose father
 and mother I met in
 Prague. They came 
originally from Lublin, Poland
, wh ere today Toidya lives. A
nd I stayed in his apartment 
in London, while he went home to sleep every night, to Blackpool. He -- His family was 

in Blackpool, but he commu ted.
 But he had an office in L
ondon, and a room there where 
I slept for a few -- I would say a week in Lo
ndon, before I got to Portsmouth in -- on the 
Queen Mary. 
Q: Let me ask you something about -- again ab
out returning to Bosk
ovice after the war. 
Your -- You were -- You were the surv
ivor of a very unusual experience. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: I mean, not only ha -- were you a surviv or
 of a concen tration camp , but you were a 
survivor of an extermination camp. Did 
anyone ask you what you
 had been through? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, people were listening and I 
had a need  to talk. I had a need  to talk 
constantly. But it was one ear in and the ot
her ear out. Didn™t make -- Didn™t make any -- 
any impression, any -- any lasting impression. 
And today, I want to tell you honestly, so 
they do talk, what happened, and everybody comes to meetings
, you know, but that™s all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
57 
 
 
Nobody talks about the real re
asons why it was possible to happen . Go back into  history. 
And I intend to translate this, and then I w
ill have an opportunity to
 talk about the camp 
and the life, I will bring this up, too. Th
en, if you want to, I will send you a good 
translation of the whole thing. 
Q: Okay, yeah. I™m su re the ar
chives would be interested. Di
d you have the feeling that 
people believed you wh en you ta
lked ab out what had happened? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
. They believed me, but they didn™t
 care. As a matter of -- I -- I 
have a very funny experience. I was at one tim
e in Naples, Florida, and there my wife™s 
two cousins were very friendly with some no
n-Jewish people, and we
 had a meeting, and 
he wanted me to tell them what
 I went thro ugh. And next to
 us stood a group of Jewish 
women. As soon as they heard my story, they 
left. They didn™t want to hear it either. That 
doesn ™t me an that others would, but that 
group, they didn™t want
 to hear it, it w as 
probably  too emotional for them. 
Please excuse me [inaudible] 
Q: Okay, sure. -- block. 

A: When I left the farm, after hugging my --
 my  gospardash Po charlie, I went past the 
barn and into the field, and there I was appr
oached by a Russian so
ldier, with a automatic 
carbine and he asked me who I am and I tried 
to tell him in Czech and he finally let me 

go. And I went thro ugh th e fields in a big ci
rcle, and came to Piaski, where I have seen 

the city half destroyed. Horses on the street 
blown up, dead of course. And th en I joined a 
huge crowd of people which were walking, a
nd I walked with them, I don™t know where I 
went. I know only th at from 
the time I left Selishky, and 
arriving ultimately in Saragura 
in Romania, it took about six weeks. When
 I first found Communist Poldalsk, in  the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
58 
 
 
Ukraine, and there the railroad station was destroyed, the city didn™t exist, actually, and 
somebody to ld me that -- I don™t know who, 
that they moved, the Czech unit moved to 
Saragura in Romania. Now I had to go to Ro
mania. At one time I g o t caught by Russian -
- by Russian soldiers and put t
ogether with German prisoners 
of war, into a train. At 
another time they kept me with Germans pris
oners of wars in a barn. I remembered one 
night I slept in a little farm i-
in -- in the stable with the 
cows. But I cannot tell you how I 
got either to Communist Pold
alsk, nor to Saragura. As soon as I was in Saragura, I 
somehow changed my whole mentality. I must
 have been absolutely depressed. And 
w h en  th ey  to ok  my  clot
hing -- I had a pair of pants and 
boots -- shoes, and wouldn™t give 
it back to me, I started to raise hell, becaus
e they were ma-making 
money on the clothing. 
And I forced them and I h -- I had a fight with
 them, and I -- the first day, I got it back. 
Q: When you escaped from Sobibór, were 
you wearing a unifo rm of some sort? 
A: No, I had beau tiful black boots. You see, in the camp, you co
uld have gotten any 
clothing you want to, the Germans didn™t 
care, because in the end they will get it 
anyways. And there were warehouses, or secti
ons in a warehouse, where there were boots 
for men and children™s shoes, and men™s pant
s and men™s coats, whatever. And my  new 
winter coat was in another building, wh ere th
ey -- where we -- the sorters, were f -- were 
instructed to deposit it there f-for their ow
n benefit, because they then took it to 
Germany, so -- with so many other things. So
, I had a pair of britches, beautiful black 
boots, which the Russians took
 away from me and gave me 
another pair of bad boots. 
And then they took those aw ay from me, another Russian, a
nd gave me regular shoes, 
with laces. So I cut o
ff the front and put the 
money which I ha
d had, into the lining of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048

shoe, because I figured these shoes, nobody 
will take and I will keep the money. But 
that™s what I wanted to tell you about the fact 
that I™d s -- could not recall my  being lost 
for those -- about five, or s -- may b e six weeks.  
Q: What changed once you got to Romania? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: H-How did -- How did that -- 
A: Or -- Or -- Or Saragura -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Once I got to Saragura, I was again -- I wasn ™t my self, but I could again think right, at 
least, you know. 
Q: Why do you think th at is
, why the sudd
en change? 
A: I -- I -- I have no idea. That was a -- Th
at was definitely -- There was definitely 
something what happened to my  mind, becaus
e o-on the farm with  Pocharlie, I had at 
least the haven there, a certain degree of security. But here, I was under -- among 

strangers, I didn't  know the language, nothing.
 Yet, I made it. And this is what I™m 
writing him, this Mr. Ribol, the director of 
the mu seum, because he wants to know all the 
details from my  youth on, and wh at happened 
during the war and where I was and -- and 
I tell him that, it™s an ab
solu te blank, I don™t know, couldn™t answ er that. 
Q: Is he going to  use that in
formation in the museum in -- 
A: I hope, I hope. Bu t I tell you wh at happen
ed, why I say I hope. A few years ago, I 
wrote an answer to a historical book written 
by a fellow of the name Professor Bronsky, 

about the Jews of Bosk ovice,
 and there were quite a few 
misstatements and anti-Semitic 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
60 
 
 
hints, and I wrote a letter, happened to be 
14 pages again, and I succeeded through my  
Gentile friends in Boskovice -- th
e local paper wouldn™t print it,
 because I told them what 
I know about the Gentile people in Boskovic
e, how they behaved, almost like gen -- 
Germans. A -- My professor of
 Latin™s son joined the Germ
an army , and then  he got -- 
then he disappeared -- it was one of them, 
but I had quite a few cases, where I told him 
what he didn™t know, or what he didn™t 
want to publicize, and the paper wouldn™t 
publicize this. So then 
my  friends arranged for having it in
 the museum, to visitors of the 
mu seum, and I sent them one issue, covered 
in plastic. Now, I found out later on again, 
through this Stanick, that the thing disappeared. Allegedly for historical reasons, they are 
studying it. And in the letter to Ribol, I™m 
writing now, also, ﬁI hope that it came back, 
and tell me why they took it away in the first 
place.ﬂ I never got an answer from him yet. 
Q: I want to talk about your journey to the 
U.S., but actually first, 
I want to go back to 
one mo re thing that you mentioned -- 

A: [indecipherable] 
Q: -- off tape. You didn™t mention -- there wa
s something that you didn™t mention during 

the interview that you wrote in
 a letter afterwards, an-and 
I thought you might want to 
add it to this tape, and that™s -- it was a reco
llection of your father, from the time that you 
were, I believe, working on a farm
 and bringing home a lot of -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- food in Piaski. And he said so
mething about how he would rather -- 
A: Oh yeah, I remember that. 
No, that was not in Piaski ye
t, it was in Boskovice. When I 
had a job with this Mr. Stanick, the son, an
d that -- the father of Joseph Stanick, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
61 
 
 
you are mentioning in the letter th ere. The 
tailors were home tailors, they took the stuff 
home to sew it and bring it back  to us, and 
I got him me rchandise, I got him business 
from Vienna, and from Stuttgart in Germany,
 because I knew perfect German, how to 
write and I wrote to the Chambers of Commerc
e, and these people didn™t have labor, but 
they had some materials, so we are fini -- 
we were finishing it for them, and the tailors 
from the little villages around, wh
ich did the work for us, they 
were very grateful to me, 
and were bringing me illegally food, like butter, 
eggs, chicken, whatever. And I sent them 
to my  mo ther, to the house directly, and she pa
id them for it, and then gave other people 
who needed it. And my father at that time said
 that I would rather eat dry bread and drin k 
plain water in freedom, than have plenty
 of here to eat. That™s what it was. 

Q: And how did you respond to  that at the ti
me, what did that mean to you at the time? 
A: Oh yeah, I think I mentione
d that too. It didn™t come 
into my mind the deep meaning 
of it, until I was in the concentration camp, 
or in Piaski, in the 
ghetto, you know, how 
much ahead he was of thinki
ng, and how already thought th
at I know everything. I was 
about 28 years old at that time. Yeah, I re
me mb er that. But I forgot all about it, you 

brought it back now into  my  mind. And -- And th
at I did -- I said, I think I said it there.  
Q: So you -- What did it -- Can you sa
y more about what 
that meant to you? 
A: What it meant to me, that freedom is pric
eless, period. And fo r freedom you have to 
fight, and you have to  be
 watchful it shouldn™t be
 taking away from you. 
Q: And you -- 

A: And this is why I love so mu ch this country .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
62 
 
 
Q: Tell me more about that. Tell me more
 ab out arriving in this country, your 
expectations and -- and what™s
 it -- it™s meant to you? 
A: I -- When I arrived in New York, at the 
pier, my uncle was waiting for me. He was an 
employee of the Shanley Hotel 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a 
very -- the finest hotel in 
town, he was a maître™d™. And he came to Ne
w Yo rk to pick me up, but the crossing was 
48 hours late, th-the first time ever for th
e Queen Mary, because 
of very bad weather. 
And he couldn™t wait any longer, because the FB I took me to Ellis Island, because of that 
dumb doctor in Prag ue. When 
he examined me before the government would give me a 
visa, they had to confe -- somebody had to conf
irm to them that I am well. So he asked 
me, ﬁWere you ever seriously sick?ﬂ And I says
, ﬁYes, at the age of 
15, I had pleurisy,ﬂ 
with an [indecipherable]. And he wrote -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: Tape three, side B, of an 
interview with Kurt Ticho Thomas. 

A: And he asked me then, after he examin
ed me, whether one can hear anything by 
listening. I says, ﬁDoctor, you ju st took my
 x-rays and listened to me, you should know 
whether there™s anything or not.
ﬂ And he wrote a thing down  th
at I had pleurisy at the age 
of 15, and when I arrived in the pier -- at th
e pier in New York, th
e FBI took three people 
from the boat -- four people. Two, I believe
, either Russians or Ukrainians, one woman 
who was Jewish, but allegedly was coming into
 the country on a proxy marriage, which 
something was not right, and I. These three pe
ople went into the -- 
on Ellis Island, into 
the political section. I went into the Merc
hant Marine section, for an additional 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
63 
 
 
examination. And two days later, one man 
came to me, I was playing chess with a 
German sailor, and he told me that I can 
get dressed and get out, and the German sailor 
translated it to me in Englis
h. And when I came th
en to the -- to the window, leaving Ellis 
Island, there was a fellow waiting for me. 
His name was Kaufman from the -- from a 
Jewish organization, from the -- I forgot now 
the name, and he took me -- w-we went on 
the ferry from Ellis Island to lo
ng -- to -- to Manhattan. And th
ere we went to a restaurant 
and I had a sandwich with cheese and ham, 
and so me mi lk. And he ordered sandwich , 
and then  I asked him how mu ch  I should tip
, and how mu ch I should tip in the check 
room, and all that. And he brought me 
to the Pennsylvania gr-gr-grandel -- the 
Pennsylv ania railroad station, the Grand Centra
l Station. And there I took a Pennsylvania 
train to Pittsburgh, where I arrived around 
one o™clock at night. And in the meantime I 
called -- pardon me -- I called from Ellis Island 
yet, and he actually put the call through 
and I sat down and before I 
could sit down, it rang already.
 I was amazed, because I got 
the call immediately. In Czechoslovakia, wh
en I was calling somebody 20 miles away, it 
took a half an hour before I could be connect
ed. So that was the first pleasant surprise, h-
how communications work . 

Q: Let™s back up a bit. Can you rememb
er where you are if I interrupt you? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. I wanted to ask you a little bit more 
about your trip. How long
 did it take to get 
o -- to get across the 
ocean on the boat? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
64 
 
 
A: The ocean? Two ye -- Two days longer, 48 
longer -- I believe five days, instead of 
three, or six instead of four. I don™t -- th
at I don™t know any mo
re. That was the old 
Queen Mary. 
Q: Do you remember what your 
thoughts were on that trip, wh
at your expectations were 
of this country? 

A: I was -- I was -- I w as happy that I was -- th
at I was going to America. I slept together 
with another fellow, down in the lowest qu
arters, on a berth above him. And he was born 
in this country, but fortly before the war, hi
s mother came back to Slovakia, his father 
was still here. And then he came
 back again as an 
American citizen, but 
he didn™t speak a 
word English. So I says, ﬁWhere are you goin g?ﬂ He told me in Slovak, of course. He 
says, ﬁConnecticut,ﬂ and the city, he forgo -- 
I forgot now the city. He pronounced it, the 
-- the -- the phonetic way, as it is written, yo
u know, that was so funny, today. At that 
time, I didn™t know better, either. 
I forgot the name of the city.  
Q: What languages did you speak at the time? 

A: Czech and German, and a little
 Polish. And a little -- I lear
ned a little Jewish in the 
camp, too, from the Polish Jews, you know.  
Q: No English at all? 
A: No. Oh, I -- very little, I m
ean, I tried to learn English, 
but this was all forgotten. 
Q: But you were excited to
 be co ming to America? 
A: Oh yeah. So then, 
when I arrived, they were waiti
ng for me, my aunt, my uncle and 
my  cousin, they had the DeSoto  car, and they 
took me home in the -- 
into their house, and 
it was a nice little house, in the campus of 
the Carnegie -- the Carneg ie Technical 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
65 
 
 
Institute. And I was going to med -- I was going 
to English elementary school with little 
kids, for about six or eight we
ek s. And then  I went to high 
school, Taylor Alderdise High 
School in Pittsburgh, and th en
 during the summer, I took summe
r co urse, again in the al -
- Taylor Alderdise High School
, and because my uncle didn™t 
want me to go to work until 
I get a little bit settled, and he wa
s so good to me
, like a father. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: Leo Steiner. That™s -- There™s his picture. 
That™s the man. And then he -- I got a job 
through my cousin™s wife™s fa
ther, who had a store with pants, and through the salesman 
of the comp any for who he was buying, I 
got the job as a cutter, in Beaver Falls, 
Pennsylv ania. I had to get up at five in the mo
rning, to be, by 6:30 or so, in the railroad 
station, Pennsylvania, Lake Erie railroad, to 
get to Beaver Falls before eight o™clock, to 
get into the plant. And then, in
 the evening I rushed
 home, and twice a week I went to the 
University of Pittsburgh, to get English histor
y and English. And there were two veterans, 
GIs who copied my work. 
Q: Really? 

A: I™m not kidding you. And when I came back
 home from school, I was so tired that I 
barely ate my  dinner, and lied down, and the ne
xt mo rning, ag ain to the railroad station. 
At the end of the year, before Christmas, th
ey gave me a box of candy and told  me I 
shouldn™t come any more, because they are 
closing up the plant, which I was so happy 
that I didn™t have to go back to th at work  
any more. Then I had other jobs, in a -- in a 
grocery store, in a umbrella shop and ag ain 
in a pants factory. I mean, that one I was 
packing rather than cutting. No
, I was working in the cutting 
room, too. And also in -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
66 
 
 
the -- in the room wh ere we put orders toge
ther. And from there I w e
nt on th e road with 
ready to wear, through the help
 of a Miss Bertha Strouth -- Strouse was her name. Sh -- H 
-- She was a buyer in a -- one of the departme
nt stores in Pittsburgh
, and through friends 
who I made in Pittsburgh, their 
name was Albert a
nd Laura Davis, they
 wanted to help 
me out of my  menial jobs, and through th
em I got acquainted with her. She acquain ted 
me with a salesman who didn™t 
want to travel in Ohio. He wa
nted to travel only in and 
around Pittsburgh. So I took 
his line on, and that™s how I met my wife, because she 
owned with her brother a 
little ready to wear store, ladies ready to wear. 
Q: What was her name? 
A: Her name was Tina Zacks, Z-a-c-k-s. 
Q: And -- And wh en was this that you met her? 

A: I met her in 1953. In 1952 I started to tr
avel, in 1953 I met her, 
in 1954 we got married 
and I moved to Co lumbus, and then my  an
kle -- uncle and my  aunt moved also to 
Columbus. That was his sist e
r, they were brother and sist
er. She was a widow, and he 
was a bachelor. 

Q: They  must have -- So, did they
 come for -- because you were here? 
A: Yes, yes. They came here because I was here. 

Q: Tell me more about your relationship with
 them in the early days. Were they -- Did 
you talk to them about what your e
xperiences had been during the war? 
A: Well, we were always a very closely kni
t family, my mother and her four siblings. 
One brother came here already befo re the fi
rst World War, but I never saw him because 

he died befo re I arrived. And th en Uncl
e Leo, who took over. His sister, with two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
67 
 
 
children from Vienna, when Hitle
r came in there. And -- And 
then I had the two cousins 
here, and another cousin  who lived close to Pittsburgh, a
nd they tried to make my life 
very nice. I have a very  nice relationship, 
they were very kind to me. And I finally 
Americanized, you know, and 
became, I hope, a good citizen. 
Q: Did you talk to them about what 
did happen to you during the war? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. As a matter 
of fact, when I wrote my firs t letter to the United States, 
when the mails started to function in ™49 -- 
1946, I wrote to Un cle Leo and Aunt Ilinor, 
my  life in the camp, and he used this during 
one of the meetings of
 some organization in 
the Shandley Hotel at that time, I remember --
 I was told later on, when I came here, of 
what was going on. 
Q: Did they encourag
e you to -- to talk? 
A: I don™t think that they did have to, becaus
e I n -- I needed to. Today I don™t. Today I -- 
Q: That™s interes -- Oh, sorry. 
A: Today I am not hundred percent, but I woul
d say maybe 90 percen t of wh at I used to 
be, before all this happened. 
Q: It™s interesting to hear yo
u say that you had the need to 
talk immediately after, and not 
so much now, because I™ve hear
d other people say, ﬁBack th
en I wasn™t ready to talk 
about it yet, and people 
didn™t want to listen.ﬂ 
A: Oh so me of them didn™t want to listen and 
some people told me I should already stop, 
you know. They  me -- They  
meant it well. Th-That was my
 imbalance. There was a 
mental imbalance, definitely. I said yesterday,
 I -- accidentally, to my sister-in-law, the 
wife of my wife™s brother. My wife™s brot
her was her husband, he passed away. I says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
68 
 
 
ﬁFlorence, you know, when  I go
t into your family, I wasn™t ri
ght.ﬂ She says, ﬁI know th at, 
Kurt. We know -- We knew that.ﬂ But they -- th
ey accepted me too, and treated me just 
like I would be theirs. 
Q: In what way -- when you say -- 

A: In any way. Any way. I had to -- the 
same right and the same oblig ations, like 
anybody else.  
Q: But in wh at way, wh en you sa
y I was not right, wh at do you mean? 
A: I -- I was not my old Kurt. I was ve
ry much influenced
 with my past. 
Q: You were thinking a lot about what had happened? 

A: Not that I was thinking, but I ch -- i-i-it in
fluenced my  thinking. 
I was -- As I told you 
before, when I finally hit the SS man in 
the jaw, after that point, even in my 
unconscience, I was afraid. 
Q: Tell that story on tape, because I -- I thi
nk you didn™t tell that 
on tape, about your -- 
your dream. 

A: No, th at was when  -- in -- in this country  already, I was dreaming -- I had a nightmare, 

always the same nightmare, that Sharführer 
Wagner is -- was chasing me, and I always 
escaped someplace in the straw. 
Jumped so meplace and lie in 
the straw, and he couldn™t 
find me any more. Until one night, I™m dream
ing again the same th ing. Suddenly I 
stopped running, and made a fi
st and hit him in his jaw. 
And from then on, I never had 
the nightmare any more, and I improved defin
itely, in my mental 
attitude, toward the 
public -- toward the non-Jewish
 public, because at the time 
when I came, I suspected in 
the first place anybody again, wh o is non-Jewi
sh, might be -- want to harm -- wanted to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
69 
 
 
harm me, o r whatever, you know. Thi-This is 
something, but it™s not easy to understand, 
and it is not easy for me to explain. 
Q: How long did it take for you -- How long 
were you having those dreams before you 
turned  around and so cked him? 
A: That I -- That I don™t remember, but it wa
s quite awhile. It could have been a couple 
of years, I don™t know. But I do not know
, I really can™t -- this is just a guess. 
Q: And then -- And then -- 

A: As a -- As a matter of fact, I w as so intim
idated also, that I didn™
t talk English in the 
public, when I was in a bus wi
th somebody, I wouldn
™t open my mouth.
 It took me two 
years, before I started to talk English in 
a bus, or in a restaurant, you know? I was -- 

Because I felt that I™m forei
gner, I have an accent -- today 
it doesn™t bother me, I know I 
have an accent, but I don™t give a hoot. 

Q: What language did you speak with your family? 
A: We spoke English, only English. When  I a
rrived, and we got to bed at night, and the 
next mo rning, when  I came into the kitchen,
 and my  au nt was giving me breakfast and 
she started to talk to me Ge
rman. I said, ﬁAuntie, please, don™t talk to me German, only 
English, wh ether I understand or not. I don™t
 want to talk German, I want to learn 
English.ﬂ And we never spoke German. 
Q: That™s very impressive. What were your
 -- What were your ideas and expectations 
about America? What was your 
idea of what America was? 
A: You know, the expectation of America were 
very much different wh
at the reality was. 
I thought that everybody is rich, and that no
body work s. And I found 
out that the majority 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
70 
 
 
of the people are not rich, the great majority, 
and ev en the rich one 
work. I also thought -- 
I -- I -- I was not aware of the fact of the 
national coherence of ethnic groups. I thought 
that they are separated, but as far as the 
nation concerns, America, if he™s Polish or 
Italian, you say something against the country, and I™m sure that they would -- they 
would not like it. Th-That was another very pl
easant experience for me. And the equality, 
that everybody is protected by th e law, and 
has the same  oblig ation, like anybody else. 
And the idea of a Lincoln, to build  a natio
n by -- by mixing, by respect and cooperation 
and understanding fo r everybody, this all I 
didn™t -- I have no -- I had no idea who 

Lincoln was. It was en  -- It was entirely 
-- I was tra -- a transplanted tree, from one 
orchard, in to another orchard, in another climate. 

Q: But then you started to st
udy about American history. 
A: Yeah, I was interested, I want -- wanted
 to know what was going on and what -- 
what™s going on now, and so  forth. 
Q: You mentioned that in -- in the early 
days you -- you felt su
spicious, and -- and 
insecure about non-Jews
, and not -- not sure wh
ether you were safe. 
A: I didn™t know -- I didn™t know how to take
 it. I didn™t know how to take it, because 
nobody made any remarks. As a matter of fact
, I got -- I arrived here in 1948. When I got 
married in 1954, we took a honeymoon to  Canada
, and th ere, for the first time, I heard an 
anti-Jewish remark. In Canada, not here.  

Q: What was the remark? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
71 
 
 
A: I don™t know any more what it was. We 
were in a store and somebody made some 
nasty remark about Jews. In Canada. I don™t kn
ow any mo re which city
 it was, but I re -- 
that I remember dis-distinctly. 
Q: And by then had your f
eelings changed, ab out -- 

A: Oh yeah, no, I was -- I was already Amer
icanized. I was already a American citizen. 
No, I was not citizen yet. Yeah, I was citizen, yeah, because otherwise I couldn™t have 
gone to -- to Canada. 
Q: Tell me about becoming a c
itizen, when did that happen? 
A: That happened, I believe, in 1953. The huge
 gathering by a judge, and a clerk of the 
court, in a big building in Pittsburgh, do
wntown. I don™t know whether it was the 

courth ouse, or whatev er. And th ere were for -- I was prepared, I was studying fo r it, and 

then they gave us a few questions, and if yo
u answered, you became a citizen, and if you 
didn™t answer, you get a citizen too. 
Q: Was it a very important occasion fo r you? 
A: Definitely, but I want to tell you, once I go
t into this country, I got a little green card, 
for identification. Not once, until I became a 
citizen, was anybody ever asking me about 
my identity. No policemen, nob
ody. It was just a entirely  different life. In my old 
country, if you went to visit some body for mo re
 than 48 hours, you ha
d to report it to the 
police. That™s what they call a 
police state. When my late gr
andmother came to visit with 
us, she had to go to the po
lice and tell them, ﬁI came fro
m Warscarvas, I™ll be staying 
with  my brother -- with my 
son-in-law and my  daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Ticho,ﬂ such an 
address. And the day before she was leaving, 
she had to  tell him she 
is leaving, where she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
72 
 
 
is going again. And that was a demo cratic st
ate at the time, already. All Czechoslovakia 
was a democratic state. The 
only one in central Europe. 
Q: Did you have friends or acquaintances th
at you got to know who were non-Jewish at 
the time, or were you mainly moving 
in -- in the circle of your family? 
A: Where, here? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I did not have any non-Jewi
sh acquaintances, with
 the exception that
 when I traveled, 
I had to, of course, approach any buyer, wh ethe
r he was Chinese or Protestant, or Jewish, 
whatever. But these were nice business frien dships
. As a matter of fact, I am still in touch 

with the former buyer of the May Comp any, 
Betty Flaherty, and one happened to be a 
Jewish fellow, Buddy Fagersner, who was also
 in a Cleveland store. But I was very 
friendly with -- with my  buyers and they had 
great confid ence in me. And when  my  wife 
died, I rememb er one of the ladies made some
 preserve, then gave it to me, you know, I 
shouldn™t -- I should have some home cooking, whatever. 
Q: How did you meet your wife? 

A: I was selling these dresses, try ing to sell th
e dresses, when I came 
into the store called 
Taft™s, in Columbus, Ohio. And 
she wasn™t there at the time, 
her si st er-in-law was there, 
and she asked me, ﬁHow does your wife like 
it when you are trav
el from col -- from 
Pittsburgh to Ohio, and you are at home only
 over a weekend?ﬂ I says, ﬁI™m single.ﬂ So 
then they introduced 
me to the single girl in the fa
mily, and that™s how it happened. 
Q: Was she Jewish? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
73 
 
 
Q: Was that important to you, to -- to ma
rry a Jewish woman? Was your Jewish identity 
very important to you at that point? 
A: Oh, i-i-it -- it was, yes. It -- It -- It -- 
It was, although it didn™t matter to me whether 
she was ir-irrelig-religious, or 
religious, but somehow there 
was a cultural background, a 
cultural need.  
Q: And you were living in -- 
A: I don -- I -- I didn™t know any Gentile women anyways. So, I mean, I don™t know 
whether -- if I would have l -- 
fell in love with a Gentile
 woman, maybe I would marry 
her too, I don™t know. 
Q: Did you talk to your wife about what 
had -- what your experiences had been during 
the war, and wh at had become of your family? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, the wh
ole family wanted to 
know, they were very 
interested in what -- 
what™s going on, and they were very -- they 
are very active in Jewish causes, you know?  
Q: Did you feel that th ey were capable of 
-- of really understanding what you had been 
through? 

A: Oh yes, oh definitely, de
finitely. For instance, my nephew -- my wife™s nephew -- 
former wife™s nephew, is today president of
 the Jewish congregation in Columbus. He™s 
very active in Jewish activities, an d also a ve
ry ardent Republican, 
who is very friendly 
with -- for instance, President Bush . And 
his mo ther is a outst
anding -- absolutely 
outstanding -- I would call her a genius. No t 
only in Jewish causes, but sh-she™s an 
inventor, and sh e very g -- very generous, 
help people. Not only 
Jews, non-Jews -- non-
Jewish organizations. I remember sh-she help
ed a woman to become an opera singer, for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
74 
 
 
years supporting her, a non-Jewish woman. 
And when she was fina
lly an opera singer 
and gave a performance in Cincinnati,
 we went down there to see her. 
Q: What was her name? 
A: I would have to ask Florence, I don™t reme mb er. 

Q: You mentioned coming to th
e United States, and having some awareness of -- of some 

of the ideals of this country , and you came in th
e early 50™s. It wasn™t long after that, that 
-- that there were a lot of civil rights i
ssues going on. Was that
 some thing you were 
particularly aware of? 

A: I want to tell you, for instance, there wa
s this Korean War. I di
dn™t understand it too 
much. I was a cutter and I was tired, and I read
 the paper, but I didn™t -- I was n o t in -- not 
into the global politics yet at all. T h at came 
at -- That™s why I say, I changed. I developed 
again into  what I used to be. It was a long process. On -- Only it -- it -- and only it came 

along because of the environment in which I 
lived, and it was protect -- it was protective 
and understanding. 

Q: Do you feel like you™re ba
ck to a hundred percent now? 
A: No. I would say it™s about maybe 90. 
Q: You m -- also mentioned -- and this is so
mething that I saw written down somewhere, 
but you didn™t tell the -- tell the story 
in your interview, 
something about your 
involvement with the trial of one of the SS members -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in Sobibór, Frenzel. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
75 
 
 
Q: Can you tell me about your 
involvement in that trial? 
A: I tell you how it happened orig inally. A 
fellow with who I wo rked in the camp, 
together in a little -- a little 
building, his name was Friedberg, Alfred Friedberg from 
Frankfurt, Germany. He was a 
-- His hobby was painting. And 
we work ed to ge
ther in this 
little place, on little items, sorting them out and 
deliver them to the Germans. And I found 
[indecipherable] money. And one day one of 
the Ukrainians, which 
have close by kept 
the horses, came into our place, and picked  up
 a fountain pen and a pencil, whatever, and 
I had the money there prepared, and he pick ed
 up the money too, German marks. And the 
next day he came and br
ought us a liter of vodka and a kilo
 of Polish kielbasa. And that 
went on all the time I -- we wo
rked in this -- in this little 
place. Every second day we got 
a kilo and a liter. The liter we gave away, we 
didn™t drank it. Gave it to some other goy -- 
boys. But the salami k ept us alive, until that
 stopped, the job ther
e stopped. There was no-
nothing met to sort, and I went back into th
e sorting department and then I became sick. 
Got the flu or the typhoid fever, I don™t know 
what it was. But that 
I mentioned in the -- 
in my -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- memo ries there. And then I became th
e sanitator, the man who was taking care of 
the sick people. And what did you ask me originally? 
Q: I was asking about your invo
lvement with the trials, the po
st-war trials of Fre-Frenzel. 
A: Oh. Oh yes. This Friedberg
 got the job to make the labe
ls for the SS wh
en they were 
going back to Germany, the address labels 
on their lugga-luggage. 
And he had any name 
but of the commander of the camp  and of 
Sharführer fr -- Wagner. Wagner was too 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
76 
 
 
shrewd to  give it to anybody. And at one tim
e he told me, ﬁYou kn
ow, Frenzel lives in 
the -- close to Berlin, and he gave me the 
n -- city™s name , which co ntained the word  
lerver, lion in German, and I think berg or 
borg. I don™t know how it happened , after the 
war I wrote a letter to some German office, 
mentioning that we had Sharführer Frenzel, 
who was very brutal, and he lived in this c
ity, which has the wo rd lerver and berg  or 
borg. And I didn™t pay any atte
ntion to the whole thing, I di
dn™t hear anything. When I 
was in Frankfurt, I believe, at the trial, it 
was the last trial, there was a public persa -- 
persecutor, his name was Pfeiffer, very nice 
young man, and he ca
lled me aside and he 
says to me, ﬁYou know,
 because of your tip, we went to
 -- we went, looked at the map, 
found the town next to Ber
lin, found Mr. Frenzel work ing as a carpenter, wh ich he was 
originally, on a stage in a th
eater. And that™s how we got 
him.ﬂ And then I testified 
against him, I was called as a witness. The fi
rst time in 1966, and 
then later again, and 
then he was sentenced to life 
and then he got out on so me 
kind of a legal point, I don™t 
know wh at, and I had to go to testify again, 
and then he got again arrested, and ended in 
jail. He is not alive any mo re, I don™t thin k so. He was a year or two older than I.

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is tape number four, side A, of 
an interview with Kurt Ticho Thomas. We™re -- 
We™re resuming on the following day, it™s now June th e 24
th
, 1999. And so do you want 
to start by telling me -- you had a couple of 
things that you rememb ered, that you wanted  
to add. I™ll hold -- 
A: The first thing what I want to mention is 
that when I was transl
ating the letter to the 
director of the museum in Bosk ovice, that 
the word which I was mi
ssing, which actually 
is the deed, when the church
 was selling wh at it™s called indagencies, to those who 
sinned, and were buying off their -- their si
nning. That™s number on
e, number two, wh en  
I was translating that same letter, I omitted, 
I believe one sentence, which I definitely 
want to repeat, namely , when I say that Chri
stianity is a noble religion, which will be 

here for eternity. And now, if you allow me, 
I would like to start to read two letters from 
Theodora Toidya Cobaletska, that™s her -- that
™s her married name, the daughter of the 
farmer, which she wrote me on my inquiries in
 the 90™s, what happ
ened during my  stay 
there, which I could not know, because I coul
dn™t get out, and after I left. All right then. 
Here is the first letter from
 Toidya, dating into  September 19, 1993. ﬁDear Kurt, in 
reference to your letters of 
March 15 and August third, 1
993, I am conv
eying to you 
information regarding my parents and my fa
mily. My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa, 
was born Ap ril 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitz
ca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while 
my father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Mi
ch ael and Mary anna, was born on April 21
st
, n -- 
1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska. To
gether they will work  
as farmers o n  their 
farm in Sialishky. Through their own daily wo
rk, they managed to acquire a larger farm, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
78 
 
 
and until Hitler™s German inva
sion of Poland, in Septembe
r 1900 and 39, they were 
leading farmers in the village. After that, my
 father worked simulta
neously in the Casa 
Shef-Shef-Shefsheek  Savings Bank in  Piaski
. The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi-
exploitative regime and the for -- the for -- th
eir forced deliveries 
of goods ruined the 
Polish countryside. The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime an d the 
forced deli-deliveries of goods
 ruined the Polish
 countryside. Not fulfilling the quotas 
was cruelly punished by the German admini
stration, with arrests, and with sending 
people to concen tration camps. The period of
 the German occupation was a brutal time, a 
time of violence and terror. There was a lack 
of food, and the basic food articles were 
distributed by means of ration cards. I reme mb er
 that Mama used to prepare a syrup from 
sugar beets, and we sweetened our black co
ffee with it. There were times when there 
wasn™t even flour for bread, which Mama ba
ked herself. Our basic diet was mi lk and 
potatoes. Thanks to the resourcefulness of my
 father, there was never any real hunger. I 
remember the day when you came to us at nigh
t. My father warned 
Moth er not to give 
you any food th at was too fatty or excessively ri
ch during the first few days of your stay 
with us. After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your 

stomach and your whole digestive system. At th
at time it was not easy to get medicines 
and cu ring you would have b
een made significantly more 
difficult under the conditions of 
your concealment. I want to mention that my
 parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors, 

who were numerous around our farmyard. 
A woman by th e name of Fran-Franechka, 
who was very nosy, was sp
ecially dangerous. She lo
ved to look after -- around 
everywhere, in the outbuildin
gs, and tell the whole village
 what was going on around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
79 
 
 
there. For that reason also, we had to maintain
 the greatest possible vigilance of all costs. 
After that, there was a young girl in our hou
se, by the make of Kriska, who was with us 
as a helper in the housekeepin
g. Her mo ther asked my  father
 whether she could work for 
him so that she could be registered in our
 community. Wer -- This 
registration saved her 
from being carried off to forced
 labor with the Germans. I reme mb er also a conversation 
of my father with his brother, who likewise li
ved in Sialishky, who to ld father that a 
neighbor had told him that there was someone
 hiding in our outbuildings, because one 
night you could hear co ughing. This informa
tion from his brother made my  father very 
uneasy and he told you about th
is occurrence, indicating that
 he wo uld have to  change 
your place of hiding. Father,ﬂ -- pardon me, he 
didn™t tell me about that, but he said that I 
should not cough, 
but he didn™t tell me why. I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the 
reason. ﬁFather and Mother were considering 
how to do this in or
der to create safe 
conditions for your further stay in hiding. With
 that goal in mind, both of them went to 
Mama™s brother, who was living in the village 
of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers 

from Sialishky, in order to di
scuss with him the matter of tr
ansporting you to that locality 
and of concealing you at his fa
rm, but that event turned out 
differently. It happened that 
my  mo ther™s brother was being sought by th
e Germans and had to  hide himself as well. 
In that situation, Dad and Mama decided that
 you would remain further at the place in 
Sialishky, whatever the conseq
uences. In regard to Kriska
, you -- who had seen you in  
the barn, Dad explained to her, if I rememb
er correctly, that you were one of the 
partisans, who was hiding there. It goes w
ithout saying th at it was impossible to let her 
know who you were, and in  the interest of th
e safety of all of us. Apparently, she must 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
80 
 
 
have believed Dad™s explan ati
on, because, as it turned out,
 the matter never came to 
public attention. Fu rther -- 
Fortunately, as you know, we 
endured those hard times and 
lived to see the liberat
ion. For us, the day of liberation,
 which came in our area in the 
second half of July, 1944,ﬂ -- it was rather at th
e very end of July  -- ﬁwas a special day. It 
was possible for you to leave your hiding place,
 and you were able to return to a normal 
life. We were overcome with great joy. That
 which had seemed an impossible thing, had 
become a reality. Our faith and 
confidence, in the help of Go
d, and also our prayers had 
been answ ered. After your departure from Si
alishky, at the end of July , 1944, we 
continued to be uneasy about wh ether you had 
made it in s -- in sa
fe and sound to  your 
home in Czechoslovakia. Your letter, sent fro
m the ship Queen Elizabeth,ﬂ-- but it should 
be Queen Mary -- ﬁsaying that 
you were alive and on your 
way to United States was an 
enormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our
 hearts to be at ease. We were able to 
think about you -- your new life, with a feeli
ng of relief, and to wi
sh that it would be a 
happy one. Our country was free from under Hitler™s occupation and we thought that the 
peaceful life would now en-ensue. In the mean
time, from the very beginning, there were 
starting to be arrests, death se
ntences and deportations to pris
on camps deep in the Soviet 
Union, from which many Poles never again retu
rned to their countr
y. They a -- They 
arrested members of the National Army, and 
those who did not acce
pt the new political 
order. A difficult period for the Polish societ
y had begun. Many in nocent people died 
during th e consolidation of the people™s go
vernment. The truth about these times of 
violence and repression has just recently 
begun to come to light, little by little. In 

September ‚44, my father was arrested on 
the charge of possessi
on of weapons and of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
81 
 
 
concealing partisans. In our home, a rigorous 
inspection was carried out by fu nctionaries 
of the Bureau of Security. Mama and I were 
terrified and beside ourselves at t h e thought 
of wh at would become to us 
in the future. At a certain ti
me, Mama and I left our home 
and possessions. Ou r neighbors took care of th
e entire farm during our absence. Such a 
situation could not continue, 
however, and our return to Si
alishky was necessary, without 
regard to the consequences. That was a very 
difficult time for us. The Bureau of Security, 
after many interrogations, was not able to prov
e the charges they ha
d brought against my  
father, that his possessions of arm,  and concer
ning partisans. Father did not return home 
until December fi -- ™44. However, there was 
not any further peace. Difficult times began 
to wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by th e 
people™s government. My father was likewise 
accounted as one of these kulak
s. Extremely high tax charge
s and mandatory deliveries of 
agricultural produ-produce, and livestock, we
re imposed by th e office of the community, 
aimed at liquidating the so-called kulak  farm
s. If the farmers did not comply with the 
community prohibitions, they we
re e -- threatened with seri
ous penal consequences. With 
hard labor, my parents endured even this hos
tile rate of taxation, of the people™s 
government, or wealthy farmers. They worked
 on their farm until a
dvanced old age. My 
parents did not want to leave 
Sialishky, here they had th ei
r family, neighbors, their home 
and their free life. On the other hand, being with
 us in Lublin, they 
were condemned, as it 
were, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of
 neighbors with  whom they  had lived together, 
or a -- great part of their lives, and to lack 
of all of that which surrounded them in the 
village. Simply put, they neve
r im-imagined a life in town for themselves, an d I am not 
surprised, because the link with their envi
ronment, which accomp
anied them almost 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
82 
 
 
throughout their lives, was so strong th at it 
could not be broken. My  father, right after 
Mom™s death, when  we wanted to bring them 
to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two 
months, and not until December, di
d he decide to come to ou
r home in Lublin. While he 
was with us, he was extremely homesick 
for Sialishky, and it might be that the 
homesickness and idleness hastened his death. Mom died  June 28
th
, ™71, in Sialishky, and 
Father on April 1972, in Lublin
. They are both burie
d in the cemetery in Piaski. I want to 
mention that I have been married since Decem
ber 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in 
Piaski, and worked there initia
lly, in the cooperative agricu
ltural market, afterwards in 
the cooperative savings bank, and later, after 
bringing up the children,
 in the post office. 
There was always frequent contact with my  
parents, especially during the times of 
intensified field labor. All my family [indeci
pherable] these jobs. Ou
r children spent July 
and August vacations in Sialishky, and to th e 
extent they could, help
ed their grandparents 
with the harvest. Myself and 
my husband, who likewise are wo
rk in Piaski, took a leave 
of absence at the time, and sp
ent it working on my parents fa
rm. In 1966, we
 obtained an 
apartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Stre
et, and a new phase of our life began for us. 
My son Andre finished  at that time, the [i
ndecipherable] technical
 school. My  daughter 
Alsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymna
sium, college preparatory high school, and 
the younger daughter, Eva, went into the se
cond class of basic school. I, after coming to  
Lublin, have been wo rk ing con
tinuously at the post office in
 Piaski, which allowed me to 
be continuous -- in continuous 
contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride 
after work on my  bicycle, about 
three to six kilometers from Pi
aski to Sialishky. At that 
time, my  parents were already over 76 years 
old, and had less and less edj -- energy to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
83 
 
 
work. They sold part of their land because 
they were no longer
 in any condition to 
manage it, and earlier -- and -- an
d earlier, a part of the land 
had been sold to pay taxes 
imposed yearly by th e people™s government
 of the community. They were on what 
remained of their farm right 
up to Mom™s death. My fathe
r, after the final liquidation on 
the farm, came to our house in Lublin in De
cemb er ™71. All my  family hold them in fond 
memo ry. They were people of high mo ral 
le-level, upon whom it was all -- always 
possible to depend. Their mo st particular 
character trait was kindness and fondness for 
the family, and that was felt in
 every step in their contact 
with us. For that reason also, 
our children were always very eager to be 
with them, and receivedeach announcement of 
a trip to Sialishky with joy.
 Fo r us and our ch ildren, my
 parents home was always an 
oasis of peace and joy, where everyone alwa
ys felt happy and secure. That resulted in 
their positive influence on our h
earts and minds, and arose fro
m their deep faith in the 
values of the Christian teaching, on which th
ey were followers. Kindness, tolerance, and 
mutual respect. My parents and all of us were
 eager to see you after years, once again in 
Sialishky, but that has turned  out to be impossi
ble. I think that this will come true to a 
certain degree with your meeting with your s
on -- with  our son Andre and his family al-
although in America, where they have been
 living permanently since September 1988. 
May he represent those who have
 already departed from this world, my  dear parents and 
us all, living in this country. 
We have the hope that this 
meeting will take place. Lublin, 
December 19, 1993, Theadora Kobaleska.ﬂ 
And now she™s got a beautiful letter -- 
Q: Let™s pause for -- Let™s pause for a minute, don™t -- 
A: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
84 
 
 
Q: -- read those yet. Let me ask you so meth
ing ab out that. Did y
ou -- Did you -- Did you 
ever go back  and visit? 
A: No, no, I never went back. I was afraid
 of the Polish Communist government, I -- I 
never went back. Bu t we are continuously  
corresponding and I am helping them out. 
Q: Did you know Toidya wh ile you were there? 
A: Yes, I s-saw Toidya a few times. She was 
a girl about 18 years old that time, and I 
don™t know whether I mentioned it in my  stor
y, at Easter, 1943, she came out of the 

house while I was watching the yard, with a 
little basket on her arm, and with her came a 
young man. He stood in front of the house, on
 the side in front of the house and she went 
toward my hiding place. And wh
en she got in, she reached me
 the little basket. And there 
were Easter cookies, and colored vodka to dr
ink. There -- There -- They regarded me as a 
member of their family . It wa
s really a beautiful relationshi
p, and I told him he raised 
himself a son, and I am treating her like a sister.  
Q: What -- How did you start to correspond w
ith her? Was that something that you had 
been doing over the years? 
A: Well, originally I wrote to her parents,
 but then when they
 passed away, and we 
continued some corresponding in Czech and 
Polish on either side, 
her husband Yanoush, 
started to study English, and 
from then on we started to co
rrespond English on both ends, 
and you could have seen the im
provement in his English as ti
me went on. It was really 
interesting. And he™s a very find ma -- very 
fine man too. By the way, their oldest son 
Andre came a f -- quite a few years ago with hi
s wife and two daughters to the -- to the 
United States. They™ve -- They le
ft Poland. And they live in 
San Diego, California. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
85 
 
 
tried to send them some money and the first time they finally took it. 
And then he told me 
they don™t want any help, they
 want to do it on th eir own, and a very, very proud, fine, 
noble people.  
Q: This is the second letter th
at -- will you say something -- 
A: I am now continuing with the follow up le
tter after receiving the first one, I wrote her 
and this is the answer, dated Lublin, December the 17, 1993. ﬁDear Kurt. In reference to 
your letter of November seve
nth and to th e information wh
ich I sent you in a letter on 
September 19, I would like to finish descri
bing those events that I still rememb er from 
that letter. I began working at S-Spudsyai
rn a rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in 
September, ™41, and my  wo rk th ere prevented me from being taken to a forced labor 
camp in Germany. In the fall, and especia
lly during th e winter, I frequently spent the 
nights in Piaski, and during the spring an
d summer, I often came home to -- by bike. I 
was in Piaski the day you arrived at my  pa
rent™s home, on October 18, 1943. The next 
day my  mother came to me and told me about
 your arrival and that same day I came to 
Sialishky and we were tell -- talking. I believe
 roo -- you reme mb er that mo me nt.ﬂ I don™t 

reme mb er that she was talking to me, that
 Toidya was ta-talking to me. ﬁI stopped 
work ing at the Sporgiana and came home to liv
e with my parents with
 my father -- when 
my father took me from Piaski . This happened when the Germ
ans and Soviet armies were 

approaching our village. During 
this time, attacks from wa-war
 planes, were intensifying, 
which were bombing German regiments and fl
eeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame . 
At that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the 

Volksdeutsch, had penetrated in
to the village, took horses a
nd anything else they could, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
86 
 
 
and fled west. I and several other people
 from the village, took
 our horses from the 
stables and we ran off in the meadows to
 prevent the Germans 
army from requisi -- 
requisitioning our horses. We spent the night in 
the fields, in the bushes, where we safely 
waited until the morning. The Ge
rman army horse corp, and 
along with them civilians, 
arrived in our yard that same night. Many fa
rmers ran off into their meadows, whereas 
my  parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara re
mained in the buildi
ng. In the morning 
my mother came and told 
us not to return home yet. We re
turned to the village only in the 
afternoon, once the Germans left. As we 
later discovered, rebels from the Polish 
underground army  ambushed th em outside of 
Piaski. Most likely they were Germans and 
Ukrainians. A portion of them who surviv ed
, returned to  Sialishky and ordered us to 
leave our buildings because 
the Soviet army  was going to  occu py them. My parents 
quick ly load ed the wagon with  foods and clothe
s, and at that time, 
informed the military 
personnel that the messengers from the village 
went to the commander in Piaski to verify 
whether this order was reliable. They were 
surprised by this information and shortly 
afterwards, left the village. 
Our village is located between 
two main roads, which when 
leaving Piaski, one leads to Ho lm and the 
other one to Zamo sc. 
The Polish and Soviet 
armies were advancing on the road to Holm
 from Piaski, where the German™s army was 
retreating likewise it on the road from Piaski 
to Zamosc toward Lubl
in. Both sides were 
exchanging machine gun fire from both Jal a
nd the highest point -- from both Jal and the 
highest point in Sialishky. The villages, Driz
ishky, Drazitchae, Jel
ltov and Piaski, and th e 
surrounding area were aflame, but our village 
was preserved. During this shoot out, we 
were sitting in a man -- manhole across from our 
residence, that was dug up by my father

and our neighbor Alexander Paster
nak. In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding 
place, there was another exit through the attic
 into Pasternak™s sh
ed, that led to the 
meadow. My father explained to me that in 
case of any danger, yo
u could have run away  
by opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed
. After the German ar
my  retreated beyond 
Lublin, I decided to turn to wo
rk  in Piaski. That was at the end of July ™44. The day you 
left our house, I was at work. In my fath
er™s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable] 
Piaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, becaus
e that was where the 
Polish and Soviet regiments were located. On  
the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were 
many deserters dressed  as civilians, of whom my
 father was suspicious, so he decided to 
lead you to the road be
yond the yard, that led 
to the main road.ﬂ Th
at is not so in my 
memory, but it doesn™t really matter. ﬁYou as
ked in your letter if
 anyone heard you 
coughing. That was our neighbor, Adam Sma
lleara, who walked  by your hiding place to 
his farm buildings every day. He told hi
s neighbor Constanti Poch arlie about the 
coughing in your -- in our build
ings. He was my father™s br
other and frequently  came to 
our home. The next thi
ng you asked is where my  mo ther 
and I were when we left our 

home in Sialishky after my  father was arrested, 
and who took care of our farm. My father 
stayed with the si -- her sist
er, who lived in Volla Garjanits
ka village, and I stayed with 
my cousin in Lublin. In our 
absence, my fath er™s brother, 
Constanti  Pocharlie and his 
wife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and liv
ed near us, took care of our farm. They 
informed us through acquaintanc
es that it was possible to retu
rn to Sialishky. Was Kriska 
in Sialishky? Sh e did not live there. She 
was from Walla Posi -- 
Biasetska village, a 
municipality of Piaski. Some information ab
out my family. My hu
sband Yanoush worked

in Piaski, wh ere [indecipherable] during th e 
German occupation and several years after 
the liberation in  -- until 1949, and su
bsequently in Lublin, December 31
st
, 1981. From 
January first, ™82, after 40 years of work in
g, the -- h-h-he retired. Our son Andre was 
born January 10, ™47 in Piaski
 and graduated from a techni
cal school in Lub-Lublin, and 
as you know, lives in the Un ited States. He ha
s two daughters, Monica is 17 and Biara is 
16. Our daughter™s Edjberta, her married 
surname being Warchieska, was born January 
first, ™48, in Piaski and r eceived a degree in Lublin, and 
subsequently in Warsaw. She 
was 21 all -- She has a 20 year old daughte
r, who il -- Ivana and lives in Warsha -- 
Warsaw. Our daughter Eva have --  her 
married surname bei
ng Remish, was born 
December second, ™5 8, in Piaski, and received 
her degree in Lublin 
and has a 12 year old 
son, Pavel and lives in Lublin. We move fi
 -- from Piaski to Lu
blin, with our entire 
family in ™66, where we are still living to
day. If you would like any more information, 
please write, and I will gladly send it.ﬂ 
That™s the end of the second letter. 
Q: It mu st have been in teresting to learn 
about wh at was going on 
from their perspective 
during th at time that you were there.  

A: I -- I remember when I got 
married, in ™54, I think not too long later, I got a request 
from them, the only time they as
ked fo r anything. They told me that the oldest son, 
Andre, who now lives in San Diego and 
the second born da
ughter, will have 
Confirmations. And they need for the girl, a l
ittle white dress. So my
 wife Tina had made 
up a dress with the -- with the 
repair seamstress in the store, and we send it to them. It 
had a stiff crinoline, and they thought that th
e crinoline is being wo
rn outside instead of 
supporting the dress, and I got 
the picture, the confirmation pi
cture with that crinoline on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
89 
 
 
the outside. I never told  Toid
ya about this mistake, but it was really  funny, and a 
beautiful picture. I have the photograph someplace. 
Q: What -- 
A: I have also the photograph of Stanislav Po
charlie and his wife Anna, in the suit which 
I sold him, f -- and which he mentioned to me
 that I owe him -- that
 h e owes me  so me 
money fo r it. I have that picture, too, and the 
suit is as crinkled as 
it was when I s -- when 
I smuggled it out of the ghetto in to the village
 to him. But these were beautiful people, 

and they  were so kind to each other. A beautif
ul married life and a beautiful family life, 
the daughter, she was -- she was a queen , 
yet she was a wonde
rful daughter, you know, 
Toidya. I have -- I have very warm memories, full of gratefulness. 

Q: What was it like for you to learn about some
 of the trials of the 
Poles in the area, and 
just to think of it fro
m their perspective?  
A: That™s what I just wanted to  let those 
know who will study the 
situation, that the 
Polish people, who were anti-Se
mitic, unfortunately, but that 
was again the fault of the 
church, later on suffered so 
mu ch by th eir own Co mmu nist system, undeservedly. In 
other words, they were always between two 
big millstones. On the west was Germany, 
and on the east was R u ssia. And Poland was act
ually divided, I believe three times during 
the history. The last time it was unified in
 1918, when  the southern  and -- and western 
part belonged to Au stria-Hungary . The north
ern part belonged to the Germans and th e 
eastern part was Russian. They 
-- They had very -- a li -- ve
ry few periods of their own 
nationhood, I think under the yagalons, wh ich 
was a -- which was a -- they are kings, the 
yagalons, they were very, very well known, hi
storically. But the Polish nation as such, I -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
90 
 
 
- I can see a very smart people, lacking 
some education and also infrastructure. 
Communications, roads, electricity, that was 
missing. Bu t the peopl
e itself, are just as 
good as any of the civilized nations, or mo
re civilized nations. I w -- I wouldn™t -- I 
wouldn™t say that they are not civilized, but 
less me -- technically me
s -- less developed.  
Q: Do you want to say anything
 else about them before we move onto a different subject? 
[indecipherable] question -- 
A: No, I really -- I -- I -- about the Russians? 
Q: No, about -- about th
e -- your -- the family ? 
A: About the -- no, no, I -- I -- I think I said 
everything I felt and feel about them, bef -- if 
I should rememb er later, I might be sorry, bu
t right now I do not know wh at to say. 
Q: When  we stopped yesterday, we were talk
ing ab out your experience with going to  the 
post-war trials.  

A: Yeah. 
Q: And that you had testified 
a few times ag ainst Frenzel. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you said somet h ing abou
t how he had -- he had -- about wh at his sentence was. I 
wanted to  get mo re of a sense of your experi
en ce with going to those trials, and what did 
you testify, and meeting othe
r people who had surviv ed So
bibór while you were there, 
and wh -- and what that was like. 
A: The trial, generally speaking, were orga
nized in such a way, that one witness per 
week. I did not see a witness who was before 
me, or the one who came after me, because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048

the court wo rked  only on Monday, Tuesday a
nd Wednesday, I believe
, and Thursday th e 
-- the court wa -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
A: -- ee -- d u ring the trial against the 
accused, Karl Auguste Frenzel Rosen, 
Undersharführer, or Sharführer of the SS. Firs
t in Hagen, where I was two or three times, 
and then in another time, I was either in Fr
ankfurt or in  Kur-Kurnamrine -- no, I was in 
Frankfurt, Frankfurt mine. Anyhow, at one tim
e, he denied that I am the person who was 
in the camp, and the presiding judge, I belie
ve his name was Schneider, stood up angrily 
and he says, ﬁMr. Thomas, how did they call 
you in camp?ﬂ And I says, ﬁKurt.ﬂ And then 
he said to Frenzel, ﬁNow, don™t you rememb
er a Kurt in the camp?ﬂ He says, ﬁYes, I 
remember a Kurt, but this is
 not the Kurt which was there.ﬂ He deny -- He was lying 
through as much as he could, but ultimately 
he was sentenced to life, because there was 
no death penalty in Germany, which he later 
on, fo r some legal reason, renewed the -- the 
trial, after b eing jailed for quite a few years,and the last trial confirmed again his guilt.  
Q: What -- What did you testify, and what was 
it like to te -- to be faced with this person 
and to testify against him? 
A: Well, I felt a certain satisfactio n, that he c
ould see that some of us surviv ed and that he 
couldn™t get away with what he -- what he ac
tually was doing. He was really exploiting 
us very badly. I am -- Otherwise, I -- I do 
not reme mb er now anything during the trial, 
but I would say this, ﬁThere were actually th
ree German families, w h ich took care as 
much as they could om -- om --
 of us witnesses. One always
 was resting, while the other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
92 
 
 
two were active, and in my case, it was anot
her judge, who was very kind to me, with 
who I correspond once in awhile
, and then  there was the wife of the principal of a high 
school, their name was Wagner. Very, very kind,
 nice people, who tried to make us feel a 
little bit at home while we -- while we
 during the trials in Germany. 
Q: What year were those trials tak ing place? 
A: The first one was in 1966, and then I coul
dn™t tell which following years when it was. 
But the last one, I was a re -- I was real surp
rised, because it was quite a few years when 
they started a retrial, after he claimed that
 he was sentenced inno
cently. And that was 
quite a few years later, it must have been in
 the 70™s, already. And also Germany looked 
entirely different at that time, than during the 
first time of the trial. 
Even the hotels were 
so mu ch better, and -- and the fo od and th
e -- it was an -- it was already a Germany 
restored, almost comp
letely, economically. 
Q: What was it like for you to be in Ge
rmany, and how did you find the Germans? 
A: Those Germans which I encountered, were 
very, very  nice, very kind, decent people. 

And I believe that the German people are a --are very -- very, ve-very good nation, like 

anybody else, but they were 
misled by a -- by a govern
ment, by getting promises, and 
also because they suffered of the -- of th e defeat during the first World War, which was 

interpreted to them as a -- as
 a reason to avenge it. But no
body wa -- was tellin g them that 
they actually started the war themselves, I 
mean it -- the war started  in -- in -- after 
Ferdinand Testi was killed in -- in Bosnia by
 Gavria Princip, a Bo
snian nationalist, who 
killed the successor to the thro
ne of the Hapsburgs
. And they gave 
the Serbians an 
ultimatum which they 
couldn™t accept, and that™s why 
the -- how the war started. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
93 
 
 
when Austria declared war on os -- on Serbia
, the Russians declared war on Austria, and 
the French declared war on th
e Russians, and -- and Austria,
 and the English way north, 
and the first World War started. 

Q: Did you feel any anger at all to wards th
e Germans when you we
re ther -- there?  
A: When I was in Germany? No, not personal. It
 was rather a historical feeling, but I had 
nothing against the German population any mo
re. They -- They we
re defeated, they 
changed their political system, an d -- and th
ey were admitting their guilt, and paid 
restitutions, so what else can you -- can you as
k? I think they were, in -- in the aftermath, 
they were the most decent ones of all -- of al
l the nations who were 
involved in the war 
and took advantage of the superiority of 
the German army, o-of the -- of the -- the 
German government. 

Q: Did you ever feel angry at anyone? 

A: No, I was -- certainly had no
 friendly feelings toward Fren
zel. As a matter of fact, I 
just remembered, I was waiting 
one mo rning on a stone bench in the courthouse. I came 
earlier than necessary. And next 
to me sat another German citi
zen, he was -- at that time, 
at least, I would say 20 years older than I. An
d I told him -- he asked me what I am doing 
there, and I told him that I am there, 
being summoned as a w
itness, and mentioned 
Frenzel, and then I mentioned another -- a
nother SS man, whose name was Gomersky. 
And he to ld me that he knew the Go mersky™s 
boys, pre-war, that they were very, very 
poor people, they had nothing, they didn™t have even 
a bicycle. And when Hitler came 
into power, or rather, before he came into
 power, the n -- the National Socialist Party 
supported the family, for the pr
omise that they will be voting National Socialist. That™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
94 
 
 
what he to ld me. And Gomersky, I have seen, 
he was already sentenced, I think. He died 
in prison. 
Q: You mentioned earlier that rig h t after th
e war, you™d sent some information to the 
West German government about Frenzel, an
d about his hometown, 
and where it was -- 
A: Yeah, i-it wasn™t the government, it was some kind of a court. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But it was a -- it was a government institutio
n, but not directly the government, and I -
- I mentioned that Frenzel came from a city, as
 I said this before, which consists of two 
nouns, lerver, lion, and borg or berg. 

Q: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that and wh at 
I was wondering is whether -- did you feel -
- did you trust the German govern ment to act
ually persecute it™s criminals at that point? 
A: Well, I-I really -- I knew that the Germans 
are persecuting those Nazis. It never came 
into my mind that they will not pick up the information which 
I gave them or -- or -- or 
simply pigeonhole it someplace. B u t it never cam
e into mind either, that they will take a 
map and find th e city and -- and -- and find th
en Frenzel in this 
theater, working as a 
carpenter. It was just a lucky coincidence th
at Friedma -- Friedland -- no, Friedberg, told 
me where he -- where his hometown was. If I 
would have asked Friedberg at the time, 
ﬁGive me all the names and addresses of all 
the people,ﬂ he would have given it to me, 
but who thought of that we will come 
out one day and be able to use it? 
Q: I wanted to ask you about the -- So, during
 that time, y ou didn™t actually meet with 
any of the other Sobibór survivors? 
The time that you were testifying? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
95 
 
 
A: No. I didn™t see any of the surv ivors, alt
hough I think that at one time, I was going 
back to the United States with
 Samuel Lehrer and his wife, Gail. No, no, no, they were 
still there, and th ey asked me because I will be home in [indecipherable] sooner than I, to 
call their ch ildren that they are alright. I thin
k we -- we -- we saw each other there for -- 
for a short while, in Germany. 

Q: Have you had any other kinds of -- of ga
therings, of that -- that group, or any 
[indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, we had some gatherings. One time 
we were together in New York, when the 
movie about the uprising of Sobibór was premiere
d, and we, the survivors, saw it first. At 
that time, the United States 
witnesses came to  see the mo
vie, and even one fellow who 
was in South America, Shlo mish Misener, he
 -- he too came. The movie was financed -- 
The making of the movie was financed by the 
Chrysler corporation, and it is often shown 
on PBS, the uprising in Sobibór. 

Q: That™s the one called,
 ﬁEscape from Sobibór?ﬂ  
A: Yeah, ﬁEscape from Sobibór.ﬂ 

Q: That™s right. 
A: At that time I had a dispute. I, on one si
de, against all the other former internees, 
because I didn™t like what Hollywood made 
out of the story, by adding things which 
never happened, and not telling about those things wh ich were just as important, and 

didn™t show them in the movi
e. And they  were angry with me that I was mentioning th at. 
And I said that history -- as these documents
 should be a historic
al document, should 
really tell the truth, and not be biased
 by so me filmmaker, who made up a story. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
96 
 
 
Q: Have you had a -- There™s been so mu ch 
material on the Holocaust coming out ho -- in 
Hollywood and popu
lar culture -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- lately. Have you had a problem with that? 

A: Well, some of the literature, I will have 
to mention my former colleague Blatt. He 
issued a little booklet, and it is in such a lo
w standard, and so  unin
formative, actually, 
that it™s ridiculous that some
body even printed it. There is 
another book wh ich I read, by 
Jules Scurvis. He™s a -- a Holland citizen
, from -- from Holland. A
nd he spend one hour 
in Sobibór. When  his transport arrived, 
they pulled out from 
the transport, 80 
typographers, and he wa
s one of them too, but he was 
not -- he was not taken. So he 
asked an SS  man whether he could join th em, 
and the SS  man kicked him in his butt into 
the group. Now there were 81. 
They were used during th e wa
r for typographical -- for -- 
what do you call it, when y
ou print books? Printing purposes
, and also, I understand, for 
falsifying British currency, counte
rfeit. It™s interesting that 
of the 81, he was only one 
who surv ived, and th en  wrote a book about Sobi
bór, and it was interesting. He put into it 
-- I have it here, all the names of the some 34,000 Du tch people wh o came from 
Westerbork to Sobibór by transport, by date
, and alphabetically. 
And that book was 
reprinted many times, because people were in
terested, not only 
about knowing about 
Sobibór, but about those who perished there. 
That book is there, I can see it from here. 
It™s in -- It™s in -- in Dutch,
 in Hollandish, and I got later 
on a translation in German. It 
was translated into German. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
97 
 
 
Q: Did you say something in 
your first interview that 
Jules Scurvis had told  you 
something about the fate of your 
family, or am I misunderstanding? 
A: No, Jules Scurvis could not 
tell me, I told Scurvis about th
e fate of my family, and he 
put it in the book. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: There is also my -- a pict
ure of mine in that book. 
Q: What about other times that you™ve gotte
n together with survivors from Sobibór, has 
that happened? Have y
ou maintained contact? 
A: Yeah, it happened, b
ecause I used to go once in awh
ile when I was in New York, on 
busin ess, I used to go to  wine land, where qu
ite a few of the former survivors of Sobibór 
were in the chicken business,
 and egg busin ess, you know? So
 I met with them there. 
Q: What was that like? 

A: It was a friendly get togeth
er, you know. We -- We were happy that we are around and 
that we outsmarted the German
s. I also forgot to say yesterday, after the war, when I 
came to the United States and I married my wife
, I worked for awhile 
in their store. Her 
brother and his wife were together with a partner in a business where they manufactured 
slippers. Originally -- The orig
inal trade name was Angel Treads. And th en they  came out 
with another line called  Deerfoams. And when 
the -- Prior to that yet, I was working in 
another bran ch of their business, called Ho
use of Foam, which was selling foam rubber. 
We represented Firestone inAkron, and I was active th ere, traveling a little bit, and 

selling the stuff wherever I could. And we 
made pillows. And then
 when they came out 
with the line of Deerfoams, 
the comp any™s name is R.G. Barry Co rporation, with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
98 
 
 
headquarters here in Columbus. I got a line of
 these Deerfoams and started to travel, to 
introduce that line of slippers, washable 
slippers in Pennsylv
ania, Ohio, Michigan, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, I for
got now wh ere else. Min-Minnesota, and 
introduced these slippers and 
got them into big stores, and as the distribution rose, and I 
could not handle that many states any more, I 
was giving up territory, and ultimately, I 
landed with four or five cities in Ohio, lik
e Columbus, Cleveland,
 Dayton, Youngstown. 
That™s about it. And then I retired in -- and 
that™s how I make an -- a living, and a nice 
living.  

Q: Di -- Was your work  an important part
 of your life, was it particularly -- 
A: Well, I devoted all my energies to my 
work, and -- and to my wife. These were the 

two main objectives, and I was successful 
building up this business, and the comp any 
was very nice to me, to o. 

Q: Did you have any ch ildren? 
A: No, I didn™t have any ch ild
ren from my -- with my firs
t wife, neither -- nor no-none 
with my second wife, of cour
se, we were too old already. 
Q: And you mentioned that yo
ur first wife passed away? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: When  was that and -- and how did that happen? 

A: She had circulatory proble
ms and later on also develope
d Alzheimer™s, and he passed 
-- she passed away in  ™82. 

Q: And -- And your -- you remarried when? 

A: ™84. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
99 
 
 
Q: In ™84? 
A: In ™84, yes. 
Q: Will you state your wife™s name? 
A: Gloria, Gloria. She™s American born 
also, just like my first wife was.  
Q: We pause for a second. It™s -- Well, it™s in
teresting that you -- th
at you pulled out th e -
- the book that Thomas Blatt wrote -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- because I had a quote from the in
terview that we did with him. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And -- And I wondered what your response wo
uld be to this. And he says, ﬁThe fact is 
that the survivors from the d
eath camps act co mpletely diffe
rently than 
survivors from 
concen tration camps. Concentration camp  surv
ivors have societies -- have societies. 
Mau-Mauthausen prisoners, Au
schwitz organizations, and Bu
ch enwald. You never hear 
of S-Sobibór or Treb linka orga
nizations, or Helmno. First of all, that™s you on the left, 
but people ask me, do you get to
gether? No, we don™t get toge
ther, we don™t get together 
because our memories are too terrible, really, to
 talk about, so we don™t have contact with 
each other.ﬂ It sounds like what
 you™re saying is different. 
A: It is not only different, this is -- he 
personally, had with him -- Shlomish Misener, 
staying fo r six weeks, when  they  were trying 
to put together a book. So, th-that is already 
in contradiction that we ne -- didn™t get toge
ther, we did get togeth er. I was together this 
last winter with Esther Robb and her husb
and, wh ich was not in the camp , and with 
Samuel Lehrer and his wife in Florida, a
nd it was I who initiated that meeting. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
100 
 
 
already set for next year, that we will make it
 so that we could be longer together than a 
few hours. 
Q: And -- And he emphasized -- 
A: I went, for instance, to Chaim Engel™s so
n™s Bar Mitzvah in Connecticut. And I try to  
be in touch. But then , when  I had that cont
roversy, that dispute about the movie, with 
which I cannot come out publicly, because I di
dn™t want to put wind into th e sails of 
those who denied th e Holo caust. I felt orig
inally, and I -- now I -- it watered down, 
definitely, that me -- th at feeling, that the 
only thing I have in co
mmon with them is, the 
physical living together in the camp, but that intellectually, we are far apart. That was my 
feeling at the time, and I was very angry an d 
frustrated, because they were at me like I 
would been a traitor, when I mentioned that 
the movie is not really a hundred percent 
correct. In -- In the basis, it 
was correct that th ere was a ca
mp  and there was killing going 
on, mu rd ering, and th at we s -- that we 
had organized an upri
sing and some of us 
survived. That is true, but certain details were not -- were not true. 

Q: Did they not agree with 
you that certain details -- 
A: That™s exactly, they disagreed with me, be
cause he didn™t want -- they didn™t want me 
to even mention that there™s a
nything wrong, which shouldn™t 
have been there in the first 
place, and that they omitted other things whic
h they sh ould have put in. And I think the -- 
the -- that -- that is my -- my -- th at I put 
one and one together. The 
main reaso n  why this 
happened  to  us, Esther Robb went to Yugosl
avia twice when the movie was made, as a 
consultant. First she went as a -- as a volunt
eer, and then when  they saw that she could 
give some information, they made her a c
onsultant. And sh e had in her power to do it

right, because she has a good memory, she™
s a smart girl. And -- But she let them do 
whatever they wanted to do, 
and -- and on that she -- in that
 sense, sh e is guilty in my 
own mind. But I forgave her already, b
ecause it doesn™t make any difference.  
Q: Okay, there was some -- some
thing else -- on the -- the whole idea that survivors of 
extermination camps, as opposed to concen tra
tion camps, have a very different kind of 
experience, do you think th ere™s anything to th at? 
A: I don™t believe that, what he said, becaus
e it was the trauma of the beatings, of the 
servitude wh ich we have to manifest and -- 
and th e horrible conditions
, and to know that 
many people got killed. What is the differe
nce? I -- I don™t -- I don™t believe that I 
suffered more than somebody wh
o surviv ed Mauthausen and 
Dachau. I personally don™t 
agree with that, and I don™t know how he came
 to that conclu sion, as if he would be a 
better, more elite caste of the survivors.  
Q: You mentioned something yesterday about 
how, immediately following the war, you 
had more of a need to spea
k about it than you do now. 
A: Yeah, yes. I don™t have any need now at all. 
But at that time, it -- I think that there was 
-- there was something mentally, 
because wherever I had an op
portunity, I started to rattle 
down my experiences. 

Q: Did you ever meet -- Did y
ou ever do an y public speaking? 
A: No. I had one little speech at the university 
here, and it was a fiasco, because first of 
all, there w ere only very few listeners. More 
than half of the listeners were frien ds of 

mine, instead of students from the university. 

Q: When  was that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
102 
 
 
A: Oh, maybe four or five years ago. 
Q: Hold  on. Did you say that 
you had gone to visit in -- 
in Boskovice, one time, after 
coming -- 
A: Yeah, it was a -- 

Q: When  was that? 

A: That was, I -- in the 90™s,
 in the early 90™s, after the 
Communist system s-stopped to 
exist. Later, a year later, I think, I went
 to Czechoslovakia and was in bo -- was in 
Bosk ovice for about three days, 
but I stayed in the hotel in
 Bernau , and we commu ted by 
taxi, because the -- the accommodations in Be
rnau were -- were easy and also I had 
friends in Bernau, survivors. 

Q: Will you tell me something about that trip, 
and what it was like for you to visit again? 
A: Really, it was nothing dramatic. The mo st dr
amatic thing was when I wanted to visit 
the graves of my  late grandparents, my  fa
ther™s mother and fath
er, Josef and Rosaria 
Ticho. They had two very nice tomb stones, 
and before I went to 
America, I erected a 
plate -- a marble plate, which 
was affixed on the two to mb st
ones, in which I remembered 
my  parents and my  sister, that they perished  on June the 23
rd
, 1942, in Sobibór. The 
stones were -- were -- f-f-fell down and -- no, at th
at time they were s
till there. No, at that 
time they were already gone. It was -- The st
ones were f -- laying flat on the ground and 

the tablet was torn off, and I could not -- I di
d not know that I need 
a key to get into the 
cemetery and I didn™t even know wh-w ho th
e key -- who the -- would have the key. I 

crawled over the fence, into the cemetery, a
nd that was the most dramatic thing on -- on 
the whole trip. As a matter of fact, we went 
first to -- where did we go first? First to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
103 
 
 
Hungary, and stayed  in Budapest, and my  fri
end Rudolf Hurlinger, with his wife Inga, 
who live in California -- she unfortunately died 
a few months ago -- went on a trip with a 
group. And as it happened, they  also went to 
Hungary, to Budapest, and also to Vienna, 
and also to Czechoslo vakia. 
And we, my wife and myself, 
we were on our own. So we 
happened  to  meet in Budapest, in the hotel
, and when I was leavin
g with Gloria, the -- 
their room, I took the elevator, 
and in the elevator I see a ma
n, and I look at him, and I 
says, ﬁSir, aren™t you a senator of the Unite
d States?ﬂ And he sh
ook my  hand, and he 
says, ﬁI am Sam Nunn, and this
 is my  son.ﬂ He introduced 
me in the elevator, and that 
was the day when Yeltsin stopped that tank 
in Mo scow, during th e revolution there. And 
I says to him, ﬁYou know, Senator, we were lu
cky in -- in Russia.ﬂ He says, ﬁI just came 
from there, and we were really lucky.ﬂ And in
 the meantime the elev ator stopped on the 
first floor, and there were people waiting fo
r him already, downstairs. That was in 
Budapest, and th en we met again in -- in Vienna, and th en  we met again in Bernau. 
Q: With Senator Nunn? 
A: No, w-we -- 

Q: Okay , okay. 
A: -- my  friend, Rudy and Inga. 
And we wanted to go to -- to
 see the Spielberg, which is 
the same name as the producer of the movi
es, Spielberg, the same sp elling, which was 
originally a torture camma built in the mid ages. And they tortured their people for 

religious and political reasons, but it wasn™t acce
ssible, so  we decided instead, and took a 
cab and went to the Matzocra, 
which are limestone caverns, built by -- partly by the water 
seeping through from th
e outside, and there™s also a ri
ver on which you go on the little

boat called Punqua, which was very interesting,
 that we spent togeth
er there with Rudy 
and Inga. Where else did we -- Oh, yeah, th en
 in Vienna, I knew my  best friend™s brother 
-- 
Q: We s -- sorry, why don™t we sw

Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
A: -- which was a younger brother of my  -- of 
his brother, who was a very close friend of 
mine, and we arranged a meeting and we met 
at the opera house. Inga, Rudy, myself, 
Gloria and Emmanuel Ohare came too, and we
 had dinner togeth er and -- and then we 
went to see the opera. I forgot now what we 
saw. And then in Prague, we met again with 
Rudy and Inga. And we stayed downto wn  in a 
hotel, and they stayed 
on the outskirts in a 
hotel, with -- with was orig
inally built during th
e Communist system for Communist™s 
functionaries only. It was a luxurious place, 
I went there, with every amenity you can 
imagine, with terraces in front 
of the rooms. And they stayed
 there for two or three nights 
and we stayed, as I said in 
the -- in down town. And there I 
met one of my  school chums, 
from high school, Rudolf Bubla, who help ed 
us in Prague. He was a very nice fellow, 
who became a professional officer of the Czec
hoslovak army, and then I found out later 
on, when I met him after the war, in Prague, 
how terrible all these officer were treated. 
He worked in a coal 
mi ne for years, because he was a officer of the Czech army  during 
the occupation of the Germans. 
Q: During th e war? 
A: During the war, yes, yes.  
Q: He was not Jewish [indecipherable] 

A: No, he was not Jewish. Otherw ise, he wouldn™t -- 
Q: He wouldn™t [inaudible].  
A: Cramp -- Cramp in my foot. Yeah. 

Q: What about return  visits to Sobibór? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048  
106 
 
 
A: I never made it, and maybe 
I should have gone, but wh at would I have seen there? I 
have ha -- I have pictures. There is nothing th
ere but a elevated mass of -- of soil, and a 
monument in memory of those 
who got killed there. And I c -- I couldn™t -- I couldn™t do 
anything for them anyways, so I -- no -- so
 I -- I never went. There was a big -- There 
was a big gathering, and I think that Mr. Blatt 
was there, too. I was the only one missing, 
at the 50
th
 years anniversary of the uprising, I belie
ve. That would have been ™4 3 -- in ™93, 
there was. And I have, someplace, even pict
ures. You can remind Mr. Blatt that he was 
there too. 
Q: One more question then. Did you make a 
conscious decision not to have ch ildren? 
Was that something that -- 
that meant anything to  you? 
A: I tell you, we considered -- we were talki
ng about ad opting and I could not, at the time 
at least, accommodate my  mind, that I could l
ove a child which is not of my  blood. So  we 

dropped the idea.  
Q: Is there anything y
ou want to add or say? 
A: No, I want to thank you 
for being patient, and co ming 
here, and I hope that we 
fulfilled our historical duty, to put on 
the tape, whatever I could remember. 
Q: Thank you very much, appreciate it. 
A: Yes, it was a pleasure, you are very nice
 lady, and you are very
 good looking, too. 
Q: Oh, thank you. We™ll have that on the record. Okay, this concludes the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum in
terview with Thomas Ticho 
-- with Kurt Ticho Thomas. 
Thank you.
