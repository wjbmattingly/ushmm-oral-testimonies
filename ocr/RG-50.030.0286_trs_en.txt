ANNA LEISER-KLEINHAUS 
 September 29, 1994 
 
Q: Will you just begin by telling me  your name  
during the war and date of birth and where 
you were born? 
 
A: Okay, well my na me  during the war was -- I 
had several names, but the name  I was born 
to was Annaliza and I wa s born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936. 
 

Q: So you were very young at the time before 
the war.  You probably don't have too much 
me mory about what was happening prior to the wa r? 
 

A: No, only very sporadic me mories of my fa
ther and me mories that perhaps are based on 
stories more than me mor i es but I do think I ha
ve very clear pictures of going to the park 
with my dad and playing with him and doing 
things that normally you would expect a 

boy to do with a father rather 
than a little girl and I thought
 that people usually ask me  
why I chose a profession that I chose and a
lthough my father was a very orthodox Jewi sh 

man and certainly would have never admitted to
 that feeling I think that I was his fi rst 
born and I think he considered me  in some  wa
ys his son.  I reme mber the feeling of going 
to the park and playing with him and him 
being perhaps more involved with a child, 
particularly a ma n of his generation than you'd ex
pect him to be particularly with a girl.  
That's what I reme mber. 
 

Q: You had a comfortable family life? 

 
A: Yes.  I reme mber having two dear little fr
iends who lived with us in the same  house, and 
my grandfather and just pictures mostly 
not -- I reme mber I ha
d a little friend who's 
exactly my a ge a few mo nths older and hi
s sister who was two years younger and we 
lived in the same  house and we were consta
ntly fighting cats and dogs.  We couldn't be 
without one another.  So, we al
most really always be together
 and I also reme mber that I 
didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I us
ed to give them to my
 little girlfriend.  She 
loved the dolls.  That's what I reme mber.  I 
reme mber being very comfor table.  I'm s ure 
we were not comfortable I mean fina nciall
y but I had a very nice feeling about the 
fa mily.  I mean just my grandfather was a very 
sweet old ma n.  He used to tell me  stories.  
That's basically all I reme mber. 
 
Q: Now what kind of business was your father in? 

 

A: I'm not sure.  I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond 
cutter or some thing of t he sort.  He was very, 
very religious.  I reme mber that.  He was 
always going to synagogue, comi ng from synago
gue and praying an awful lot.  In my 
head it seemed like too much.  It seemed like 
not a very tense life.  He was going to work 
and comi ng home  and we observed the Sabbat
h.  We  would always go for walks in the 

park and things of that sort.

Q: Did you have non-Jewish frie
nds as well, or were you mostly in a Jewish community? 
 
A: I was strictly Jewish community before 
the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my 
parents knew anyone that wasn't  Jewish ex
cept in an official capacity.  I don't know, 
postman, policeman, -- no social in
teraction with non-Jews at all. 
 

Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well? 

 

A: Yes.  The ones I knew.  I mean I was a kid so I don't re me mbe r  everybody who lived 
there but I would say the majority were Jewish. 
 

Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war.  Do you have 
any images of that? 
 

A: The only one is a st ory that my mo m told me
 and that sort of became an indication of my 
early rebellion and that was at some  point durin
g these --right either at the beginning of 
the war or the pre-war period my grandfat
her was beaten up on the way back from 
synagogue or threatened or ha
rassed and he I think people 
were pulling at his beard and 
he hid his beard in his coat.  When he  cam
e home , he looked really terrible and very 
upset and he had told me  that this was a Frid
ay night that Friday night when me n used to 
go to the synagogue they had a couple of 
angels who were watching over them and 
walking with them to and from synagogue.  So, when he came  back beaten and so on, I 

asked him Grandfather where were your angels 
then.  So, that picture remained with me , 

his frightened look and the statement that I 
made then, I don't reme mber having made it, 
but it fits with the way I think.  So, and seve
ral people that I have met, in fact recently, 
very recently just about three months ago wh
en I was last in Belgium said you are this 
little gi rl  who said that.  They reme mber that
 statement.  That's the only evidence I have  

of anti-semi tism that touched us dire
ctly but before I 
really don't know. 
 

Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that? 

 

A: I don't think he said anything.  He didn't say anything. 

 

Q: Did you ever have to wear the St ar of David? 

 

A: Yes, I did.  Both my mo ther and I wore it
 I think after the men, -- the husband of this 
neighbor and my dad were taken I think to 
go to a work camp, and we had to wear the 
star.  One picture I have of th
at is that she used to alwa
ys carry me  over her should to 
hide her star so that we would travel in th
e trolley  or some thing 
and she would carry me  

so that her star and mi ne were essentially hi
dden to avoid being harassed in the streets.  
She'd always do that, carry me. 
 

Q: Do you remember, and I assume  we 'l l be ge
tting into things that
 I think you probably 
have a very clear me mor y of -- do you reme mber when Belgium was occupied by 

Germany?   Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?

A: I reme mber having to leave in the middle 
of the night and wa lking through woods and 
being petrified and having German shepherds,
 hearing German shepherds barking in the 
distance and dragging and running through woods. 
 I reme mb er that, so I reme mber the 
German voi ces and the dogs, part
icularly the dogs and until 
ma ybe ten years ago I had to 
run if I saw any dog or heard a dog.  So, I've
 overcome that too, but I really was very 
shaken by a dog.  I couldn't  go in a room -- a
nd particularly a German she pherd, I would 
just freeze.  I would complete
ly decompensate so I reme mber that.  I don't reme mber the 
streets of Belgium per se.  I reme mbe r  the te
rror of what appeared -- I saw my mother 
being frightened and I became comp letely pe
trified.  I reme mber that ma rch through the 
woods and ending up in some  abandoned home 
s o me where and being there with a lot, a 
lot of people.  I don't remember who t hese pe
ople were except for those friends that we 
were living with basically. 
 
Q: So you were running to 
hide from the Germans? 

 

A: Yes, we were running to tr
y and escape because at some  
point after the two husbands had 
gone to work, during that period some people 
came into the house and they weren't really 
Nazis, but they pretended to
 be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house.  My 
mother and my grandfather and me  and they
 were really beating us and I reme mber 
screaming and my mother screaming.  They fi
nally left.  They ransacked the place and 
they were looking for money and so on.  They
 got in on the pretense of being Gestapo 
and -- 
 

Q: These were just Belgium police? 

 

A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Be
lgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of 
official capacity.  They mi ght have just done
 that.  This was a good time to do that.  I 
mean it was perfectly acceptabl e.  So, at th
at time my mother I think and her friend 
decided to leave and try to join
 the husbands and I think that
 this is when we  went to 
France with the idea of trying 
to get to Switzerland because 
Switzerland was a safe place.  
If I reme mb er when we got to the rondeveax
 essentially of where we were supposed to 
meet our fathers and some one to take us acr
oss the border, some one 
had betrayed and so 
that's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps ________________, was 

one of the camps that they went to.  I'm not 
exactly sure how we got out of there and they 

went to another camp and that period my frie
nds and I went to that home that we were 
hidden in. 
 

Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I 
don't get confused.  Now you had me ntioned that 
your father and his friend your nei
ghbor were sent to a work camp?  
 

A: InFrance. 

 

Q: This was before you went out into hiding in
to the woods?   I'm trying to get the sequence 
here.  If you reme mber, through researching a
ny dates, ma ybe that would help me  too.  I 

mean that I know that you -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286

A: I think the first time  we left, because we le
ft twice.  The first time we mi ght have gone all 
of us together to __________ in France, and 
that must have been '40, '41 some where 
around there.  And then we came ba ck to Belgiu
m.  I think subsequently the me n went to 
work again to that pl ace in France. 
 

Q: Which was called? 

 

A: ________________ or some thing like that. 

 

Q: This was near ____________ I think? 

 

A: Yes, in the north of France some whe r e.  And 
during the period that they were away that's  
when we had the incident of people breaking in
to our home and then we left I think that's  
when we we nt through the woods and were supp
osed to meet up with the fathers and then 
supposed to meet up with some one who was 
going to take us across the border to 
Switzerland, but we didn't  ma ke
 it.  So, and we got caught that time.  The first time we 
were simply sent back home .  The second 
time we got caught by the French police who 
then put us into these sort of transi ent cam
ps which are really de
portation but I certainly 
didn't know.  I don't know how muc h my parent
s knew of what these places were going 
to lead to.  I'm not sure they really knew.  
At some  point they heard that people who left 
there never got back.  I mean that through the gr
apevine that sort of information started to 
filter through and so they found that out and that
's when I was in the children's home they 
were at a camp and that's when they decided 
to run out of the camp befor e  they were sent 
to Germany. 
 

Q: Now, as I understand it, the sec
ond camp they went to was ________________? 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Were you in that at all with them?  

 

A: No, I think that when they were transferred to ___________ they had ma de some  
arrangements to take the children away and tr
y to hide them, and that's when we were, 
my friends and I in that camp in that home  near ______________. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit about the home, who was there, what was it like? 

 

A: Well, the children ranged from about four 
of five years of age, some where around there 
until they looked very big to me, but actually th
ey were 16.  I think the oldest were 16 to 
17.  There was a mi xture.  They were allrefugee children.  Many of them were not 

Jewish and ma ny were actually refugees from
 the Spanish civil war because this pl ace 
was very close to Spain.  It's in the part of
 France that borders on Spain almost so the 
catholic archdiocese of that area had taken in 
some children fro m that 
war and kept all of 
them together in that home. 
 

Q: So, this was a catholic home ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286

A: It was a catholic run home but it ha conn
ection to Jewish organization who was able to 
channel some  of their kids 
into that particular  home. 
 

Q: Now you we re about how old then? 

 

A: At that time I must have been about seven, 
six or seven because I was born in '36 and that 
must have been '42, '43 some where around there. 
 

Q: How long were you in this home? 

 

A: In this home I was approximately eight to 
nine months and that part I remember quite 
well.  
 

Q: Tell me  about it. 

 

A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real
 hunger.  Nothing to eat
, but that didn't bother 
me because I really di dn't like to eat but 
I reme mber my little girlfriend, food was her 
thing.  She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her 

food.  So, I used to run to the kitchen at nigh
t and steal whatever I 
could find and feed her 
because she was crying all night.  She 
was crying because she was hungry, and I was 

crying because I wanted 
my mother.  So, we were quite 
a pair.  So, hunger -- and I knew 
there was nothing to eat and whatever ther
e was I couldn't swallow.  I just couldn't 
swallow any food there.  The other thing I re
me mber is lice and the worst incident which 
ma y look ridiculous now but was when you ha
d lice they shaved your head, and I was 
very proud of my hair. I had re
ally beautiful long 
hair and when I found out that I had lice 
and I could tell, because I was really itching. 
 I hid in the outhouse.  There was no indoor 

plumbing.  There was indoor cold water to wash
 but no toilet.  I hid in the outhouse for a 
couple of days and nobody could get me  out of
 there because I knew as soon as they 
found out they would shave my head.  So, but th
ey eventually did. I ha
d to get out.  They 
shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible,
 just horrible.  Now, it looks kind of silly 
but and it wasn't  just lice it was scabies, 
 you know the things that
 crawl under your skin, 
so we were not really in very good shape.  A
nd there was always a feeling of fear and just 
terrible -- feeling terrible.  First of all, 
not understanding at all w
hy you were there what 
was happening, mi ssing your fa mily and just 
the terror basically.  I think I acted 
irrationa lly on ma ny occasions where I would ju
st run out of the window in the mi ddle of 
the night in the nightgown and just try to 
run away and being caught.  You know, brought 
back to this, so we had songs but I don't know
 if they made them up or the older children 
probably did which referred to us having to 
wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to 
wash with cold water and the son refl ected
 that there was no food only some  kind of 
vegetable, some thing like a sweet potatoes. 
 That's  why when people serve me  sweet 
potato at Thanksgiving I say tha
nks but no thanks.  I can't  even look at the stuff.  I don't 
know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's
 enough to turn me  off.  That's all we had.  
SO, there was a song that reflec
ted the realities of the time. 
 

Q: What was a norma l day like in this home ?   What did you do? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
6 
 
 
A: As little as possible.  I mean I'm not a ps
ychologist but if I look at myself back then I 
must have been -- I would qualify myself as 
a really depressed child, entirely depressed.  
I couldn't do much of anything.  We were ve
ry regime nted so we had to get up at 7:00 
and we lined up.  I don't know if you saw the 
several films about children's homes, 
catholic home s _________________ I think is one of
 them where children just line up 
and they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer.  They used to 

pray but we sort of didn't pr
ay along.  I believe that there 
were some  kind of organized 
games, like playing ball or something like 
that and there were various levels of 
instructions, but I don't think I learned a 
tremendous amount.  I just don't reme mber 
anything that was organized.  There was some
 instruction but I'm sure the way I feel 
when I think about it I wa s just there, but I wa
sn't  there basically.  That was that.  We  had 
to ma ke our rooms and we had to help in th
e kitchen.  We  had to peel the few potatoes 
there were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this 
vegetable was.  We had to help clean up and 
that was it.  There wa
s nothing else going on. 
 

Q: Was it crowded?   Did you sleep in th
e same area with a 
lot of other kids? 
 

A: Yes.  There were two areas, there as a fe
ma le area and there was a ma le area, boys and 
girls.  We  were lined up like in the old hos
pital wards, a number of
 beds together one 
next to another.  We  had essentially no posse
ssions.  We  didn't have anything.  We  just 
had our beds and I don't reme mber if I had any 
change of clothes.  I me an I don't think I 
had anything.  Maybe they provided us with 
some old clothes, but we didn't  have -- I 

don't re me mber having a cubicle I could call 
my own you know with my stuff.  I had 
nothing. 
 
Q: How ma ny kids were there? 
 

A: I really don't know.  I'd s a y 100 or so, not more than that. 

 

Q: Were the people who 
took care of you nice? 
 

A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell.
  I was just so unhappy.   I don't have good 
feelings about anybody there, but it ma y not be
 them.  I don't  reme mber-- for instance, 
this incident with the hair, I 
thought they were barbarians when
 they did this.  I felt that 
this was a mi ddle age torture but in retrospect
 ma ybe that was the only way to deal with 
the lice.  SO, I Thought they were me an, but ma ybe they weren't.  I don't reme mber 

anybody being particularly kind to me  or particul
arly paying attention to me  but then they 

probably were understaffed and lots of kids 
and all of us were mi serable and unhappy.  I 
know for a fact that I was extr
emely rebellious and did exac
tly the opposite of what I was 
told.  It didn't  ma tter what it was, I would 
just fight it.  I would 
continuously argue and 
fight scream run a way.  So, you really would ha
ve to be a very well trained professional 
to handle a child of that condition and they were
n't.  I assume  they were volunteers from 
the church or from other relief organizations 
and I guess they did the best they could but I 
can't  say that there was some body there that was nice.

Q: You said you were there about eight or nine
 months, how did you get out of there?   What 
were the circumstances? 
 
A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit m
uddled but apparently my parents send some one 
to pick us up from there because they were es
caping to Nice to the part of France that was 
occupied by the Italians as to the Germans. 
 

Q: How did your parents get out of _____________? 

 

A: From what they told me is that  they were 
told that they were goi
ng to be sent some where 
else and they sort of smelle
d a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say 
goodbye to their children or visit 
their children and then of c
ourse they ran away to Nice 
during that supposed trip, but they didn't come 
to pick us up because they were afraid.  

So, they apparently sent some  lady to pi
ck us up, but my  friend whom I spoke to 
yesterday, said that this person 
was afraid to travel with thre
e children, so she gave us the 
money and left and told us how to get there. 
 

Q: Were you the oldest? 

 

A: He and I were the oldest. 

 

Q: At age seven or eight? 

 

A: Yes.  And I do reme mbe r  parts of that trip 
like getting on trains and 
getting off trains and 
some how getting to Nice, but I cannot recall the 
details of that but I know we ma de it.  
My recollection is that there was no adult with 
us and he confirme d th
at that this lady had 
at least given us the mo ney, she didn't  takeit and run, but she was af
raid to travel with 
three children.  She thought -- th
e way we looked with our shav
en heads and with the lice 
and the scabs.  We  really looked 
awful so she decided to just te
ll us how to get there.  We  
had grown up pretty quickly, and we got ther
e.  We simply ma de the rondevoux with our 
parents in Nice.  That wa s --that's why I sa
y it sounds like it's not true and just like a 
dream, but it is true.  We  did get there and we
 did find our parents.  But I then in Nice it 
actually was a very happy period. It sounds also
 crazy but we were living in a hotel and 

in the same  hotel we had Italian soldiers and 
they were very, very nice.  They were not 
too interest ed in what the directives were 
from t he Nazi government.  I reme mber them 
giving me  chocolate and I used to go up with 
them and play with them. I mean they were 
just very lovely people.  And we were t
ogether but the remna nts of that previous 
experience were ther e with me and so by that 
time I was eight or so and I was wetting my 
bed and I was screaming, having nightma res 
every night and waking up and screami ng 
even though the days were fairly happy, the nigh
ts were just terrible, really terrible.  But 
that st ands out as a ni ce time in Nice because
 we were all toge ther and we would go to 
the beach and I wasn't  at the time full y realizi
ng -- we lived pretty much for the present.  
As a child in general you don't 
anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age.  We 
were together and we were having a good time.  
I could not imagine that
 first of all things 
would get worse again and that was not a te
mporary arrangeme nt, that it wasn't  a full 
time solution to the pr oblem.

Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian 
occupation, Italian German occ upation? 
 

A: Right.  But Italian, not Ge rman. The German
s came in later, so it 
really was strictly 
Italian. 
 

Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time ?  

 

A: Officially no because the official part
y line of the Italian Nazi governme nt with 
Mussolini was also that Jews had to be de
ported and rounded up, but the orders were not 
quite as effective and ther e was very little di
scipline in the Italian army, and those people 
who were in the army just couldn't care less 
whether we were Jews or some thing else.  
They simply couldn't care less so we were suppos
ed to officially hide
 that we were Jews, 
but they knew fully well we were and I thi
nk we were fairly fr ee to go and do as we 
pleased.  I'm not sure, I think that the or
der of deportation sort
 of depended on your 
nationality and so my pa rents at the time
 mi ght have become Czechoslovakian or 
some thing like that and giving 
me a different name and that name I don't  reme mber.  If 
you had Czechoslovaki an papers it really di dn't ma tter at the time whether you were 

Jewish or not.  For a short period of time  th
e authorities respected 
the nationality versus 
your ethnic background. That didn'
t last, but for a short period of time it was that way and 
the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't 
care less.  I mean they just 
did not round up people. 
 

Q:  So, you were in Nice leading what you felt 
was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway? 
 

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember about how long you were there? 

 

A: I would say also about ten months or so 
approxima tely and then when Italy capitulated 
and the Germans ca me  ma rching in through the 
part of France that had previously been 
occupied by the Italians. 
 

Q: When was this? 

 

A: The end of --must have been the beginning 
of '44 or some whe r e around there, I think.  
The war was over in '45 and we were in ____________ for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 

or so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of th
at.  At that point the news spread rather 
quickly that -- well they alre
ady knew what the Germans we re doing to various people in 
various other places, so when they heard that Germans were comi ng they decided to run 

and again try to get to Switzerland the s
econd time around.  Things moved very quickly 
so it also became known that entire families 
were subject to be ing arrest ed and they 
would be preferable for wome n and children we
re still sort of le
d through without being 
bothered or had a better chance.
  So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two 
little friends, we decided to leave from thes
e to a border town Sw
itzerland and to leave 
the me n behind and they were going to try a
nd find some way to get there, not by public 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286

transportation but try to arrange 
some  kind of private way to jo
in us.  From there we were 
going to try and get through to 
Switzerland together.  So, the 
train trip was uneventful, I 
mean my mother and myself and her friend a
nd her two little child
ren went along and we 
got to a place where I don't know
 if we stayed in a hotel or
 I don't know where we stayed 
exactly.  In the meanti me my father and 
his friend was going to come  by ambulance.  
They had found some one who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being 
ill.  So, they established a point of meeti
ng which was a block fr om the hotel where we 

had stayed.  My father for some  really stupi
d reason decided to go ba
ck to his hotel room 
because he ha d forgotten his prayer 
shawl and his ______________, and when he got to 
the hotel the Germans were there.  So, he didn'
t make it.  They arrested him.  Apparently 
Mr. ______________ waited until the 
evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm 
not going to stay any longer because we'r e going 
to get pi cked up.  So, they left and they 
came and dropped off M r . Shimme r wherever we  were.  And then I reme mber this most 

horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come  in alone.  She 

imme diately knew that some thing was very, very
 wrong.  I just reme mb er her just totally 
going completely hysterical and screaming a
nd pulling out her hair and to me  this was 
just the most frightening because I just came 
out from some thing that was relatively safe, 

and it just was everyt hing fell apart.  We st
ayed together for a while with those people 
and the fami ly had their parents at least. 
 The woma n had her parents in Switzerland and 
so they decided to really push on and try to 
get to Switzerland and my mother at that 

point said she didn't care anymore.  She just 
didn't care, and she decided to stay put in 
_____________, which was the town where we were at.  At that point we  got papers 

from people who proceeded us and who we paid 
a lot of money to get those fake papers.  
So, we changed our name again. 
 

Q: To a French name? 
 
A: A French name  so my name  wa
s __________________.  I had one or two name s in 
between but I just don't reme mber and that wa
s a terrible thing because they tell you you 
are no longer such and such but you are such
 and such, and you keep repeating it to 
yourself until you actually believe that you are 
this other person.  It gets extremely 
confusing.  At that point, I must have been 
around eight or so, eight and half, and I me an 
I was very angry.  At that poi
nt I just became very, very 
angry about everything and we 

moved into an apartment in a private house 
where they were -- actually it was owned by 

the people who lived downstairs and there we
re two floors above.  The first floor was 
inhabited by a Jewish family who were German
 Jews.  They had become  French, but they 
were Germa n Jews originally, and then we ha
d an apartment which was not really a real 
apartment but just under the roof where the 
roof actually meets the floor.  It's called 
_______________, like an attic apartment essentiall
y.  I don't know if we had three or 
four rooms t here, but really two rooms 
maybe, just two room, one which was an 
everything room and one which was a bedroom.  
We  stayed there pretty much to the end 
of the war with the false iden
tity and at that time , my mo
ther became involved with the 
resist ance not officially part
 of it but harboring people who 
were in the resistance and 
also harboring a lot of people who were in 
transient trying to get to Switzerland.  She 
would provide them with hiding place and with
 food and when they le
ft they left their 
papers behind and we'd get their ration cards 
for food.  So, at that point, we were really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
10 
 
wealthy in terms of food availa
bility.  It was a time for me  where I was pr etty much like a 
street child.  I did whatever I wanted.  I wa
s supposed to go to school but I never did.  I 
mean I said I was going but I played hookey and 
I was hanging out with sort of the worst 
characters of the town, but compared to what  worst characters are now, I guess they were 

pretty mild.  But we just would go and hide 
and play.  We 'd play three mus keteers and 
we'd play all these fighting game s.  I  didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and 

when I was there I was so disruptive that they
 used to throw me  out, so it really didn't 
ma tter.  But I learned how to read by myse
lf.  Two things I wa s doing.  I was reading 
voraciously.  I didn't understand a thing of what
 I was reading.  I just simply didn't 

understand.  I was just reading books and books.  
Whatever it was, it didn't ma tter what it 
was.  It could have been the phone book.  It
 didn't ma tter.  It was an escape, you know, 
and I could just not be in the 
present.  It was away from 
everything.  I had another friend 
then who lived nearby.  I was friends with all 
the village kids, basically.  Then, the people 
who were renting us the place were ve ry, ve
ry ni ce.  They were French, but they 
pretended not to know, but they knew of cour
se that we were Jewish.  They never 
questioned anything, but they knew and I used
 to go to church with them on Sundays 
because it wa s kind of accepted and would be
 better that I would show up.  And my 
mother's French was not great.  
It st ill has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had 
really become completely fl uent fro m that time in Nice and in that  home I was perfectly 

fluent so I could pass for French kid easily. 
 They thought it would be a good idea for me  

to go to church, so at least the child goes ev
en if the mother doesn't  show up.  I was quite 
taken by that service.  As much as I had b
een anti-religious to my
 own religion, there was 
some thing very comforting about the church 
and the priests and there was a very safe 
feeling in that big building 
and the way the voices resounded.  That I reme mber that 
feeling for the church.  Now, I hate the cat
holic church, but I real
ly felt very comforted 
by that whole atmosphere.  The daughter of 
the people who were renting the place to us 
had her solemn communion as they call it, and 
I was very envious.  They wore this white 
dress and this white veil and to me  this was 
like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all 

these things.   
 

Q: Do you think unconsciously anyway that
 you knew these people were not being 
annihilated the way Jews were. 
 

A: Oh, I knew that going to c
hurch was a safe thing that 
once you belonged to that group 
you were okay.  So, I guess it was wa nting to be 
safe and wanting to be part of another 
group.  I me an I knew that I couldn't tell who 
I was.  And, as I said, I was really very 
angry and I was very nasty.  One of the pe
ople that my mother had taken in in the 
meantime until they got someone to take th
em to Switzerland was extremely fearful for 
good reasons and was not leaving the apartmen
t at all.  I mean it was just really 
sequestered and would not go out.  My moth
er was circulating freely with her fake 
papers. I mean if they would really look into
 it they would have found that her French 

was not great and she would have been pick
ed up, but she braved it so to speak.  I 
certainly could pass for a French kid, but this
 ma n and his wife were there and they we re 
absolutely pe trified.  He, in particul ar wa
s just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had 

curfews where we had all the windows and so
 on, and I used to come  home  suppose dly 
from school, but from wherever I was hanging 
out and I would scream at the top of my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
11 
 
lungs for him to come  down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up.  I 
had this little thing, and if he didn't I was goi
ng to give him away to the Germans.  You 
could see the warped feelings
 that in some  way I could 
pass for not being Jewish.  I 
convinced myself that I was catholic and I was 
going to be fi nd.  I also knew this wasn't  
true, but some how I took it out
 on this poor guy who was rea
lly terribly fr ightened. I 
mean I can still see myself standing at the 
foot of those stairs and screami ng, you come 
there and pick up my ba g and if you don't I'
m going to tell on you.  He would come , you 
know, he would just come .  He
 didn't know what to say. 
 

Q: You were trying to exercise some  sort of control? 

 

A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't .  But 
deep inside I knew this was just really not 
true, but some how we ma naged to fake him out
 a little longer and he didn't have papers 
and he did nothing and he didn't know French, 
and he looked real Jewish.  He would have 
been picked up very quickly.  In incidents li
ke that where I was just doing really nasty, 
very nasty things.  They were really a 
way of saying, you know, I can do what I want 
basically.  I'm not going to sc
hool.  I can just do whatever. 
 Nobody can tell me  what  to 
do.  There were some  terrible mo me nts for me  be cause my mother was frequently gone, 

and I never knew if she was going to come  bac
k, and there were nigh
ts where there were 
alarms for bomb raids, and those were really 
horrible.  They were ju
st just horrible.  I 
would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself.  I was afraid to 

get out of bed let alone -- it was all in the da
rk-- let alone go down the 
stairs and go to the 
shelter by myself.  I usually ma naged to some how ma ke it to the people below and we'd 

go together.  So, when she wasn't  home, but then to go back to my place.  I me an she 

didn't want to always say that she was leav
ing, you know, to the other people.  You don't 
know.  They could put a trace on her.  Sh
e was going to Switzerland.  She was getting 
watches and she was then going to Pa ris a
nd she was selling them.  She was doing all 
sorts of weird things just to get some  mone
y to survive, and she was helping people get 
across the border, so she really never wanted 
to say what she was doing and she didn't tell 
me either.  She would just tell me I'll be back
 as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, 
that's not that reassuring part
icularly having been separation 
where I didn't know if I ever 
was going to see her again having seen her 
reaction to my father's disappearance and 
knowing that that certainly was not really good.  
I was really scared, I 
me an really, really 
scared. 
 
Q: Was the bomb shelter in your
 building or in the town? 
 

A: It was not in the building, it was somewher
e further away.  I don't exactly know where it 
was, but we had to go walk in the dark, run ba
sically and to this day I must say that I'm 
still afraid of the dark.  If I'm in the house al
one, I'll have every light on.  I just won't be -- 
I really have to talk to myself to be able
 to turn off all the lig
hts and say nothing will 
happen.  We  were in the dark because  of curf
ew to begin with and then you weren't going 
to star t taking fl ashlight s going to a shelter.  That was really better. 
 

Q: The Jewish family on the first floor
, did people know they were Jewish? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
12 
 
A: Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they 
were French citizens and so they thought -- I 
don't re me mber, or I don't  think that papers 
in France said that you were Jewish.  The 
French documents, I don't think that they me ntioned religion but I'm not sure.  They 
looked awfully Jewish, because she ha d a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very 

distinguished gentlema n, German origin, and 
perhaps he thought that was going to save 
them.  It turned out that he was picked up a 
day or two before the liberation and he never 
made it back. 
 

Q: Did you help your mo m with any of th
ese activities in small ways or --? 
 

A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housek
eeping things.  I'm sure I did some of the 
shopping where she'd send me  to buy food.  I 
reme mber going to the grocery store and 
doing all of that stuff.  In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I re me mber seeing all 

these people, being upset because some ti me s we had ten twelve people sleeping in one 

room.  We had five or six people in one be
d, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of 

threaten some  of these people, but for the mo
st part I was probably helping her as much 
as I could.  I know that as I said I'm s ure
 I did the shopping and I brought food home  and 
I helped her with cleaning up and that sort of
 thing.  I didn't go to Paris with her to sell 
watches. 
 

Q: It's  interesting that your mother, as you desc
ribe d it, really fell apart when she didn't see 
your father, and yet it sounds lik
e she was pretty courageous. 
 

A: She was extremely courageous but she wascourageous throughout but that first impact, 
that first shock and this is what I reme mber.  Now, I think there's nothing worse for a 

child than to see the mother fall apart.  As l
ong as the mother is still in tact then they 
know they have some body to lean on.  I realiz
e at that mo ment that
 something terrible 
had happened to my father but I didn't realize ex
actly what but when I saw her, it just hit 
me  like a sledge hammer .  She was really 
gone.  I mean she was just not -- I don't know 
that it lasted a few hours and ma ybe the next 
day she sort of composed herself and she 
certainly pi cked up the pi eces and went on 
and survived, and not only survived but 

helped me  survive.  There is no question 
about it, I would not 
survive without her. 
 

Q: When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was 
predictable that she would get so invo
lved in illicit activities like this? 
 

A: No, not at all.  But one thing about her 
is that even though she came from this small 
village from this very orthodox background, 
she was quite some what of a ma verick 
within her generation.  She was orphaned very
 early, I don't know if she told you that, but 
she was about six years old when her mother
 passed away, mother and one brother went 
with the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time.  She became really the 

housekeeper for her father for a short periodof time , his mot her came and took care of 

the household, and then she got killed in some  stupid accident.  She got kicked in the 

belly by a horse.  She went to ma rket, so 
she lost her grandmother ma ybe a year after 
that.  So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or some thing, so 

she was quite independent.  She had to be.  Sh
e's a really intelligent person and she was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
13 
 
always interested in a lot of things so sh
e became interested in zionism, and so she took 
Hebrew lessons secretly because it certainly wa
s considered inappropriate for a girl to do 
that. So let's say that  it's not totally out of
 character to do things which one would not 
have expected of a woman of that genera
tion and that background.  She adapted.  She 
learne d Hebrew, she learned French.  She even
 learned English at that point on her own.  
She didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all 

self ma de.  I think that she had no inclinations 
to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to 
take charge of herself when needed, and so
 she did.  This was the only thing that was 
opened to her, so she did that.  I mean th
e smuggling of the watche
s with the resistance 
that was really self preserva
tion.  I think to some  extent 
she I don't know t hat she really 
cared that much about herself at 
that point.  I think she just fo
rgot about herself.  She just 
did things for the wider picture if you wish, but
 she was no longer afraid for herself.  She 
sort of thought well, you know the worst 
has happened as far as her husband is 
concerned.  She had to leave her father be
hind in Belgium.  She couldn't take him 

because he wouldn't come .  He had to cut hi s beard off and he wouldn't do that so he 

stayed behind.  She already had lost her mo
ther and a brother so some how she felt it 

doesn't  matter anymore.  There was her child, 
and so I think she did 
a lot for me, for my 
sake.  
 

Q: Even though the people like your landlord
 who probably looked 
the other way and knew 
you were Jewish and was very kind, he must ha
ve had some  concerns about all the people 

comi ng in and out of your attic apartment. 
 

A: He mi ght have, but I wasn't  aware of any fr
ictions.  That she could 
tell you much better.  
I was very welcome in their household.  Thes
e people were -- he ha
d been a fighter in 
World Wa r I and he had actually lost a leg or
 suffered a severe injury so he was limping 
or had a wooden leg.  I just reme mb er him lim
pi ng rather heavily, and she was just a very 
sweet lady and they could not have children.  
In fact their daughter was a adopted one.  
She was one of 14.  The woma n's sister ha
d 14 children so she adopted her youngest.  
Then I was sort of a welcome addition in a 
sense because she had hoped to have a large 
household with a lot of children, and she didn't.
  I felt so good in that household.  It was 
very warm and just norma l.  Basically it was 
just  normal.  So, that I really always felt 
very good there, and my mother still writes to
 them every Christma s.  Every Christma s 
she sends them a box of chocolates.  The ol
der couple is now gone, 
but the one girl, the 
one whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother.  She's in her 60s.  I don't 

think there could have been too much antagonism.  Like I said, he 
fought in World War I 
and he was not very fond of the Germans at a
ll, and he was a really strong French patriot 
and this invasion did not sit too 
well with him, and he was sort
 of in a way sorry that he 
was too old to fight.  So, I th
ink in that sense, he knew we
 we re Jewish, but he wasn't  
quite too sure and all that activity to him so
rt of looked like a good thing in the sense of 
being resisting the occupation.  Although 
he wasn't  personally involved in my 
knowledge, he sort of turned away.  They we
re in their 60s at the time I think.  They 
looked very old to me , but again, now that 
I'm going to 58, it doesn't  look that old. 
 

Q: How did you hear about the liberation? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
14 
 
A: I'm not sure how, but I reme mber that 
we all were dancing in the streets of 
_____________.  The entire town was there and there 
was really a jubilation and I didn't  
fully -- so I guess it came over 
the radio and all the people from the resistance knew that 
the end was near. 
 
Q: Do you remember when this was? 

 

A: It was May 8 of '45, I think. 

 

Q: This area wasn't  liberat ed until then? 

 

A: No, I don't think so.  It was the final -- it 
was when they gave up.  There was no liberation 
there in France.  I mean they were there until the very last , because they picked up this 

gentlema n, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before.  She had a baby 

right then after he was gone and something r
eally very moving.  My mother went to the 
ma ternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and 

his mother lives in Israel and so does he a
nd the mother called up my mot her from Israel 
to remi nd her of the night when she gave birt
h that she had been present at that time.  
That was 40 years ago, so that '44, the end of
 '44 beginning of '45.  I don't  think it was 
liberated before that.    
End of Tape 1 
 
 Tape2 

 

 

A: When we went back to Belgium on that 
final trip back, we stopped again, me  and my 
complete negative and angry nasty self, we st
opped several time s on the road to drink and 

at one point the only thing that
 was availabl e was beer and I 
said I would rather die than 
drink beer. 
 

Q: Which mi ght have been the choice. 

 

A: A person told me  well, ma ybe you'r e just go
ing to have to do that.  Maybe you're just 
going to have to die because that's  
all we had.  Telling me , a nasty kid. 
 

Q: Okay, just to backtrack a bit from wher
e we stopped the tape, upon liberation your first 
me mory is everyone dancing in the streets. 
 

A: Yes.  I reme mber just elation.  That's
 the feeling for everybody and sadness.  My 
neighbor because she had no trace of her husba
nd, and I reme mber that and I reme mbe r  
my mother leaving and going back to Belgiu
m and telling me  that she was going to find 
my father. 
 

Q: You were all alone then? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
15 
 
A: At that point I remained with the landlord
s.  I was in the apartment, but in the same 
house.  I had been pretty much alone for a long ti
me , so at that point I wasn't  even all that 
scared because it sounded good.  
So, as I said my mother 
came  back.  I don't know how 
long she was gone, whether it was a week or
 a month.  I don't know.  She said we are 
going back.  She had found my dad and that wa
s that.  So, we went back and finding him 
was the real disappoint ment, because he had changed from the me mories.  I mean I had 
this illusion you know as a four
 year old child your father
 and the way he was involved 
with me and he was really -- he was not the 
same  person and by then I was nine years old 
and I could see things very differently.  He
 came  back. I saw him, he had no hair.  His 
teeth were shaking.  He looked 
like a skeleton.  He just look
ed frightening to me , ve ry 
frightening. 
 

Q: Where had he been? 

 

A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly.  A
nd, he was extremely -- he had become  very 
impatient and irritabl e and I just wanted to cl
ing to him and it was broken.  It just wasn't  
there anymore.  We were just comi ng from 
different places all 
together, and he had 
become  even more religious and rigid about it. 
 I had at that point completely rejected.  I 
mean I just couldn't deal with that at all. 
 I was doing whatever I wa
nted during the war.  
Certainly not observing the Sabbath, and all 
of a sudden we'r e back to not turning on 
lights, and not going to the movies on Saturday a nd all that sort of stuff.  I just couldn't  

deal with that at all.  I mean 
I just couldn't deal with that.  S
o, we had lots of fights, really 
a big arguments and right after we came  back 
we lived in a place that
 belonged to one of 
the people that we had me t in ____________, a Je
wish lady whose husband did not come  
back and who had owned a house with her husba
nd and so we lived in that place and I 
reme mber the three of us, my mo m, my dad, 
and I sleeping in the bed and he was having 
the worse nightma res and he would scream in
t he mi ddle of the night and of course I 
would just relive all my terrors. It was just no
t what I had hoped for or what my fanta sies 
had about how it was going to be when my da
d c a me  back.  The reality was very, very 
different.  Not only that, we pretty much ha
d no money so we had very cheap bed and the 
bed would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing bed I 

mean it was really terrible and we didn't  ha
ve any warm water.  We  just had a pump in 
the kitchen.  It really was very primitive.  A
nd then in my view what really ma de things 
completely disastrous was when my father
 found out about his surviving relatives in 

Russia.  He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mo
m and my dad, all of 
a sudden these people descended upon us.  Th
ere were two brothers, a sister and a 
grandfather, and we all live
d together.  There were ten 
people every day, all the time 
without any space for anybody.  It was litera
lly a nightma re.  To me , this was a 
nightmare.  I resented them for a long time. 
 I mean there was nothing else to do but I 

really couldn't  say I was very thrilled with 
that whole set up and then to top it off, my 
brother was born.  My mother couldn't  handle 
it.  She simply couldn't handle the food for 
all these people, so I essentially was trusted as
 the permanent babysitter for my brother.  I 

was in charge of him bas i cally.  I had nothing to
 say about it.  I had 
to feed him and dress 
him and just take care of him, except for goi
ng to school.  Things were just not great.  

Then, at that point, all my fears came through.  
I could not stay alone.  I tried, I reme mber 
that my parents wanted to go for a walk on 
a Friday night after 
dinner and I would say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
16 
 
sure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked 
out I was just overcome by such fear that I 
would just scream by myself in the house a
nd my neighbor upstairs would come  and get 
me .  I was trying.  I always said, sure you can go.  I'm fine.  I'm great, no problem.  As 
soon as ma ybe five mi nutes after they walk
ed it would just come  and engulf me  and I 
couldn't really function very well.  Then school wa s another nightma re because we were 

people of all ages put into the same  class.  
Now, I was put in the right grade for my age, 
but I really knew nothing.  I just knew how 
to read because I had read -- and I spoke 
French beautifully because 
finally I began to understand 
what I was reading and I 
developed a very nice vocabulary.  So, on accoun
t of that they decide
d to put me  in the 
proper grade for my age.  I knew nothing, so 
I was in school feeling like I was among - -  
just what am I doing here.  I don't know, but I ma
de it.  I don't know how I ma de it.  I just 
picked up whatever had to picked up and 
there were people there who were speaking 
Polish and there were people speaking Yiddish
 and there were those who were speaking 
German and I was speaking French.  The teachers were themselves, they came from 

concentration camps or other pl aces.  They
 didn't know anything about anything except 
they had sticks and when they mi sbehaved they hit us.   
 

Q: This was the Jewish school? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: They just rounded up whom they could find 
as teachers and there were no one that you 
could really call a teacher.  But I don't know
, I just some how s t arted to click and I 
became their prize student, so that was another 
thing that I always had this thing of taking 
out this anger in some  way, so they had th
ese donors, these potential donors and they 
were trying to raise funds.  It was a private 
school, so they would parade the bright kids 
around and they didn't have that ma ny.  This 
was like an ape in the circus, do this trick 
and do this trick.  I would recite, they woul
d ask me  a question and I would always know 
the answers.  Then, after that, there was nothi
ng in terms of disciplin
e that I would obey.  
We had these individual benches you know, a
nd I would just run across on top of the 
benches and teachers would run after me  with a 
ruler.  I mean some  of these teachers are 
still alive and when they see me
 they say all this grey hair is fr om you.  I me an, I was just 
impossible.  When I think about it now, r
eally I under norma l circumstances would have 
gone to a reform school or some thing.  It
 sort of calme d down and at that point, 

some where around the age of nine or so or te
n I said I'm going to do something with me  
life.  I'm not just going to be a housewife 
and sit here passively and have some  guy tell 
me  what to do. 
 

Q: At age 10? 

 

A: Yes.  I had a big argument with my mother's
 friends who told me  I should think of getting 
ma rried when I'm 18.  I s a id no way, not ever, an
d I decided to get there I had to get to a 
better school, and so I wa s in that school for 
two years.  This time in Belgium it's divided 
into six and six.  Elementary and then high sc
hool is six years, and I decided to go to the 

public high school.  The public high school whic
h was at the time considered the top high 
school because from tha t  one you could go stra
ight to university w
ithout having to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286

special entrance examinations.  So, after tw
o years I applied to that high school which 
was unfortunately in Flemish and that was a 
language I didn't know at all.  So, the only 
Flemish I knew was from talking to the clean
ing woma n who used to come once a week 
and that was the extent of it.  But I made it. 
I mean I got in somehow.  I guess I faked it.  
Whenever I think about it objectively I shoul
d have never gotten in there because my 
knowledge of everything was compl e tely sporadic
 and having big gaps in various places.  
I never learne d how to do multiplication, things 
like that.  Big, big gaps, but I got into 
high school, because it wasn't  automa tic.  You had to apply to get into that particul ar 

school.  So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school. 
 

Q: After the war? 

 

A: After the war, quite a bit, and there wa
s only two Jewish girls 
in that whole school, 
another one and myself.  We  really had a tough 
time.  It took us years to be accepted and 
to ma ke friends only a few friends we ma
de on the whole the atmosphere was not 
welcoming at all, not at all. 
 

Q: Were you blamed for the war? 

 

A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at
 the time there was school on Saturdays, and 
he didn't allow me  to go.  It was a horror 
show.  I already had mi ssed so much school 
throughout my life and of course they put 
Latin and Greek and ma th and whatnot on 
Saturday.  This really is not easy, and the te
achers refused to help.  I me an I would have 
to go every Saturday ni ght -- I mean that's
 why I became even less attracted to the 
religion.  I had to go and beg from some  girl 
who really didn't want to give me  her notes 
for all the lectures that had been given that
 day and then try to work it out on my own 
because my father didn't know anything and 
my mother didn't know anything about that 
stuff.  The teachers just said, her statement 
was, " Well, you Jewish girls don't want to 
come  to school on Saturday, you just work it out.  It's not my  problem."  It ma kes you 

feel that after all that heari
ng this business about Jewish gi
rls -- it was a secular school, it 
wasn't  a school that was under any kind of religio
us aegis or directives.  That's  what the 
public school was.  It was a secular school 
where there was religion gi ven according to 
what you wanted so there was one hour you coul
d choose either religi
on or ethics so you 
didn't have to attend -- because there was a cat
holic school system just as there is one 
here an official catholic school system.  
So, the people who were there, we ren't even 
observant, but they still had a feeling that we 
were foreigners.  Essentially the feeling was 
that we were foreigners.  We 
were different and foreign.  We  
did not feel very well there, 
really not, and then later they opened a Jewi
sh high school and most Jewish kids now go 
to the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted. 
 

Q: Still? 

 

A: Yes, oh yes.  They go to a Jewish high sc
hool, which the Jewish high school is accepted.  
It's a completely official school and they 
can get from there to the university, again 
without entrance examinations, so
 and that's  what I had want
ed but there wasn't  anything 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
18 
 
at the time.  We were, as I said, in fift
h grade, everybody was together, all ages, all 
languages.  This high school developed just
 a few years after I started high school. 
 
Q: What happened to
 your grandfather? 
 

A: My grandfather I think was 
essentially beaten to death.  
My mother's father, the one 
who's picture is there.  He  refused his son, my  mother's brother, left I believe it was the 

last boat that left  Antwerp 
and they went to Brazil and th
en some how got to the states, 
and he didn't want to go because you had to cu
t your beard to get on that boat.  I think 
when we fled, he refused to come  for the sa
me  reason and so apparently my mother had 
asked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take
 care of him and she said she would but 
she heard when she came back to Belgium that 
he had essentially been beaten to death on 
the streets. 
 

Q: What other aspects to y
our life during these years do you 
think are real important to 
r e me mb e r ?  
 

A: You mean during the war years? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: In what sense. 

 

Q: I don't know if I have all the right questions. 
 I think that we covere
d the areas that I had 
some  idea about, and if there's anything else th
at you think would be useful to record that 
I haven't asked you, I want you to feel free to say it. 
 

A: In terms of who I am today, I would have 
liked all this 
activity around survivors of the 
war whatever events took part in their own 
lives to happen earlier because  even as I tell 
these things and some of these th
ings bring tears to my eyes so
 that i know that I st ill feel 
them, but they'r e not -- I think I'm now perhaps ab
le and it hasn't  been that long -- able to 
associate my reactions to trauma  and whatever 
fr om the past.  So, it's hard for me  to say 

now.  The worst part of it was the fear, you know
 the absolute terror that I can still invoke 
certain times thinking back particularly -- the sa
lient points were in that home where I just 
didn't know where anybody was.  And then wh
en my dad was taken.  These were just 
terrible, terrible mo me nt s.  I know that 
until he died, my father -- I had ma ny, ma ny 
nightma res about anticipating his death that they
 were just really te
rrible and I was acting 
irrationally during ma ny years in 
relation to him in terms of be
ing so afraid that he would 
die that I could not even enjoy when I was 
near him.  He wasn't  a well ma n, although he 
pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and 
helped his br others build their own lives, 
so he did a tremendous job.  I couldn't  even appreciate any of this.  I was just always 

afraid of losing him so that was sort of some
thing that marred my life for a long time.  In 

fact, I think I was liber ated fr om
 that feeling only when he died.  When he finally died, I 
sort of gained some  peace which seems sort of
 crazy, but that's what happened.  When he 
died, I said okay that's over.  He's really
 gone and he's  not comi ng back.  That's  it.

Q: Are you at all religious today? 
 

A: No, I'm not, but I observe  the traditions b
ecause I think they'r e pretty and perhaps only 
recently I have trouble with dogma in general. 
 I have trouble with author ity, but there is 
sort of a deeper philosophy which guides thelives of those who are 
truly religious and I 
really don't refer to people who are shut 
off from the outside world like __________ or 
that type of think.  I'm thinking of my brot
her who is really an exceptional human being 
in that he lives his religion.  This is who he 
is in terms of his interaction with his wife and 
his children, his family.  He lives in Jerusa
lem be cause that's  the only place where he can 
be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically
 left wing so -- and when I see him, there's 
a deep meaning to the rituals  that is not th
e superficial type of thing that ma ny peopl e see 
and rebel against which is the things that I re
bel against.  You can't
 go here, things that 
look totally idiotic to me .  It's a lot easier to
 take an elevator let's say for a person my 
mother's age and condition than to wa lk ups
tairs.  That kind of thing, but when you go 
deeper and you ma ke it pa rt of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm 

beginning to appreciate it alt
hough I think I live my life in a cer
tain way in that sense, in 
terms of how I relate to my mother and to 
my family and I'm really a very good friend.  
People know that I'm really a loyal fr iend, that 
you couldn't have a more loyal friend.  But 

I have no inclination to do th
e ritual, but I do like to go to synagogue on high holidays 
only because I identify with the gr oup, because
 I like to be identified with the Jewish 
people.  I'm proud of them.  But not in term
s of observing the things that I consider 
interfering with the co
nduct of modern life. 
 

Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearl
y during the war years you appeared to be a 
little bit resentful of it and so
rt of embraced the security of
 the catholic church and all 
these other things and I think 
people certain people after th
e Holocaust felt stronger about 
their Judaism, some felt irrelevant . 
 

A: I don't want any part of it. 

 

Q: Or they had been abandoned by it. 

 

A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt 
abandoned by it, but as I said the story about 
my grandfather and the angels, I was ma ybe fo
ur years old when I asked him that, which 
I mean this is a logical question to ask.  
Where are your angels, and there's no logical 

answer to that.  So, then of
 course there was no time to practice the religion after that 
whole incide nt because we weren't supposed to be  Jews anymore.  That's one of the 

things I resented when my dad came b
ack.  I embraced catholicism only because it 
represented a safe haven and not because of
 anything that had to do with Jesus or 
anything like that, didn't appeal to me very mu
ch.  What appealed to me really was the 
ritual and not the cont ent.  What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and 

not the ritual.  The ethics be
hind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't 
hide that anywhere.  Perhaps if I we
re in a place where nobody observed anything I 
would do it just to express my Judaism to the 
rest of the world that way, but I don't feel 
that I have to do that.  But as I said, I do id
entify with the group, so 
--my mother saysthat 
after the war my little girlfriend, the one that
 I had spent all this time with in the home 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0286  
20 
 
and so on and we stayed friends for a while af
ter.  She became religious and I wasn't , but 
a certain point in time  we were going to 
synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers 
would try and ma ke us pray and we would just
 giggle.  I me a n that's all we 'd do, we 'd 
giggle.  We  could just not do pray or do a
nything.  Then when I went to study, I left 
home  and I went to Switzerland and the ve
ry first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to 
synagogue.  I didn't even go inside.  I stayed ou
tside the entire time, but I was there.  You 
know, I just felt that I had to 
express that I was part of th
at group but I wasn't  going to 
pray because  the prayers meant nothing to me . 
 The prayers are sometimes very pretty if 
you look at them in terms of poetry, but I re
ally don't believe in God.  I really don't 
believe in that at all.  So, my religion woul
d be expressed in terms of how people should 
relate to one another and nothing to do with 
some  superior being.  I'm a scientist and I 
don't believe in that at all. 
 

Q: Anything else you want to add? 

 

A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome
 anything.  You at some  point have to take 
responsibility for your own life, no ma tter how
 bad.  If you do that, you won't be alone.  
If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't  do anything and nothing is 

going to work out because  you went through th
is terribl e thing, then you will remain 
stagnate and people will shy away from you a
nd you'll just be a very lonely person.  I like 
to be with people.  I don't  like to 
be alone.  That's all I have to say. 
 

Q: Thankyou. 

 

A: Thankyou. 

(Viewing pictures) 
 
A: This is my mom and da d's 
wedding picture and I think that
 occurred in 1934 some thing 
like that, in Antwerp.  These 
are my fraternal grandparents,
 grandfather, grandmother, 
uncles, aunts.  That was taken in Poland.  It
 must have been around '34 or '35 because my 
father is no longer on that picture.  He  had moved to Belgium by then.  This is my 

maternal grandfather, my  mo m and dad, my 
mom's brother and his wife.  The baby on the 
old man's lap is myself and the three children th
at are standing are my cousins.  They are 
my mother's  brother's children.  I assume , I wa
s born in '36, it had to be, I was close to six 
months to a year.   That's the town in France where we stayed when we didn't ma ke it to 

Switzerland.  That was the place. 
 

Q: Weren't there a couple pictures on  here? 

 

A: This is _____________ which is on the Belgium co
ast and it must have been very shortly 
before.  The one on the right is in _____________ which is a town where my mother and 

I spent the last year of the war approxima
tely.  This pict ure is the center is my 
grandfather and it's essentially 
ma ny of the same  people that 
appeared in that previous 
picture.  So, it's my dad's  brot hers and sisters after the war 
after they got ma rried and had 
children.
