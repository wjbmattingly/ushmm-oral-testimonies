support their family, what did his parents do?

lived very modestly. But I remember Œ and I used to visit  a lot, because I think my 

parents were alwa ys working. And she sort of lived in her bed in thei r living room.

blueberries, you know, but I Œ I Œ I loved visiti ng, and I™m told that we visit Œ I have 

a sister Œ that we vi sited a lot, because m y parents were working a lot .

life, and the y were all t aken, including the people who hi d them. So t he tragedy i s, 

the y al most made it . I mean, they survived.

A2: Because he was a chemist, he ended up working in some Œ 
some chemical 
company that was considered part of the war effort. 
Q: So your fath Œ okay, let™s repeat that so t hat  we hear it on Œ on tape, is that your 

father was actually not only not deported, but t aken to work as a chemist. 

A: Right.

Q: Oka y, oka y, during Œ 
A: ﬁMy first weeks in

become clear that I would not leave accordi ng to m y original schedule, I planned to 
visit the sister of 
Berta
(ph) 
Solomon
(ph), 
Rosie Coen
(ph), m y mother, who lived 
in 
Berlin
. Remembered how helpful the 
Co
ens
 had been to my father when he and 
Hans Sol omon
(ph) Œ many sibli ngs were Œ were married to 
Leo Coen
(ph), my 
father. It Œ a pharmacist, the 
Coens
 had t wo lit tle girls, 
Doris
 and 
Hanna h
(ph), who 
they had managed to send to 
England
 with the last Kindertransport, i n August

1939, da ys before the outbreak of the war. 
Rosie
 and 
Leo Coen
, unable to leave, 
remained in 
Berlin
, and so now that I was here, I planned to visit. My mother had 
stayed in contact wi th 
Hans
 and 
Berta
(ph), who like m y release from 
K2
,ﬂ 
whatever that is, ﬁthe onl y place opened to them was 
Sha ng hai
, and through the 
Suez
 canal t o 
China
, I had gotten their address from m y mother, before she left for 
America
. You never knew where you would end up, so it was good to have 
contacts, and keep up conn
ections with 
landsl eute
.ﬂ  
Q: Yeah, people from your country. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Fellow countrymen. 

Q: Yes. 
A:Overmen.ﬁSo, one afternoon,I made m y way 
Œ m y wa y to 
Berlin
, 
Bierstich
(ph) 
Gardner Strasse
, and the pharmac y was, of course, no longer owned 
by 
Leo Coen
. It had been Aryanized after 
Kri stallnacht
. So when I came to the 
apartment, only 
Rosie
 was at home. She was surprised to see me, because I had 

come unexpected, but had brought along some tea that,ﬂ oh, his mot her, I guess 

ﬁhad sent to me. Remembering m y mother al ways reminded me never to come 

empty handed. And –ﬂ I Œ 
I™msorry, m y e yes 
Œ 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

Q: That™s oka y. 
A: Œ are not so good with this. ﬁWhen our respective family histories, 
Rosie
 was 
happy to hear that m y parents and brother were already in 
Amer
ica
, and that I was 
on m y wa y as well. Of her 10 brothers and sist ers, 
Rosie
 was the only one who had 

not been able to emi grate. Her husband 
Leo
, a trained pharmacist, was now working 
in a chemical factory that was making war materials. I understand that , as such, he 
would never get a permit to leave. He was now a member of the war essential work 

force, assigned to work far beneath his qual ifications, at wages set arbitrar Œ 

arbitrarily by the Nazis. Since the war had started in Sept ember 1939, 
Rosie
 had 

heard only sporadically about their two girls, 
Doris
 and 
Ha nnah
(ph), since the y 
had left for 
England
. Directcommunication between 
England
 and 
Germany
 was 
no longer possible, and it will come directly through friends or relatives in neutral 
places, like 
Amer
ica
, or 
Sha ngha i
, or some South Ameri can countries. I had met 
Doris
 about five years earlier, when she was visiting her Aunt 
Berta
(ph) in 
Celle
, 
and I was happy that she and 
Hannah
(ph) were safel y in 
England
. I was also glad 
to have made this visit to her mother, because she and her husband had helped m y 
father.ﬂ 

Q: So this is the last Œ t his is the l ast sort of witness report  Œ

A: Exactly. 

Q: Œ from 
Kurt
. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Oka y. And then after that you learn that Œ you learn after the war, that they went 
into hiding. 

A: Yes. My father had a friend who worked for the American government. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And it was really much later that he Œ he was able to go to 
Germany 
before, you 

know, a lot of the history was discovered. And he™s the one Œ 
but we werealready 

here. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And it was much lat er. He™s the one who found out what happened, and let my 
aunt know, and us know. 

Q: So, it was years later. Do you ever Œ di d he ever tell you the name of the Œ there 

is a German term for the Jews Œ and there were some very famous ones in 
Berli n
, 

who, in tryi ng to save t heir own li ves, would betra y other Jews in hidi ng. Whether it 

was 
s chna uper

A: No, no.  

Q: As well  as Œ you never knew the names of the people who had saved them? 

A: No, no.  

Q: And then, do you know what happened t o your parents, in the sense of how the y 
died?  
A: When, yearslater, my sister, herhusband andI
, we went to 
B erli n
, and we Œ we 
tried to find, you know, the records, and we learned that the y were sent to 

Auschwitz
. And we have the dates, that™s i n Œ in the papers there. My sister found 

that out. 

Q: Oka y. And then that  was pretty late. 

A: That was late. And t hat Œ I have that for you, in the papers.  
Q: Thank you. Thank you. It takes such a l ong ti me to piece just t hese few 
fragments of details. 

A: I know.  

Q: You know? I can™t imagine what it was like for you not to know. 

A: Well, you
 Œ 
you
 know, a couple of things happened when we went  to 
England
. 
It Œ because war broke out, the y evacuated t he entire school. So all of the English 

kids who were in our school, were in the exactl y the same position as we were. So it 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
55
 
wasn™t as traumatic, it wasn™t like we were the only ones who were separated from 
our parents. It was, they put the school on a train, the y sent you t o these remote 

places, where mostly reall y poor people had volunteered to take the children, and 

they got some mone y. So, you get off the train. The y walk you down Œ down the 

street, knock on the door, here are t wo kids, here are two kids. And we Œ 
we were 
all Œ the English kids were in exactly the same position. 
Q: So it™s a shared experience in some ways. 

A: So it wasn™t li ke we were the only Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ non-English speaking German sad litt le girls, because all the other kids were in 

the same position. And then Œ so Œ and then we still had hope that, you know, m y 

parents, we were goi ng to get together. 
Q: Yes. That™s early on? 
A: It was early on, and there was hope that they Œ  we would meet, and all come t o 

America 
together. I thi nk that kind of saved the total shock. The other thing that 

happened is Œ course, we didn™t speak the language. So, there were a few German 

kids, and t he y sent us t o whatever t he local school was. I practically had no 

education. 

Q: You™re talking about in the countryside. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
56
 
A: In the countrysi de. So the German kids stuck together, and then the teacher 
separated us, so that we would speak English. And the funniest thing happened. 

Because one of the German kids, somebody said to her, where Œ you know, where 

did you get your accent from? She picked up m y accent. So, you know, was really 

funny,becauseshe sounded more German than 
Œ 
Q: Than you did. 

A: Œ than I did. And of course, we had to learn English. 

Q: Of course. Of course. 

A: And then it was a crazy time, because Œ I don™t know whether you™ve watched 

any of this, or this German stuff coming back now. We spent half our ti me in air 

raid shelters. We basicall y had no education. 

Q: Let™s Œ l et™s loop back a little bi t then, to the very beginning of your ti me in Œ in 
Germany
 Œ in Œ i n

. You went by train? 
A: By boat , and then by train. 
Q: Oka y. So Œ 

A: I think we went to

revisit some of the questions I asked about your childhood in Œ i n 
Berlin
.  
A: Oka y. 
Q: Oka y. One of them was that, off camera, your son told me that i Œ  your 

interactions with Brownshirts on the street, someti mes went even be yond just being 

handed a flag. That people Œ that someti mes they would talk to you. 

A: I think he™s making that up.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: I™m not sure. Th-They assume t hat I was German Œ 
Q: German. 

A: Œ cause I looked that way.  

Q: Oka y. So you were blonde and blue e yed, is that it?

someti mes some propaganda literat ure.

parents said, we™ll see you again? Was it at  that point, was it befor

like this is your legac y, this is your Œ 
who you 
are. And Œ  
A: I was so touched. I mean, it was translated by 
Kurt

A: I think so. Cause there wasn™t much Œ 
you

Engl and
, 
they were all  non-Jewi sh, I mean, all the fami lies were not Jewish. I t hink the only 
Jewish family is t he girl that I lived with i n the end. I™m sure they were Jewish. 

Q: Oka y, oka y

a whole Œ t here™s a whole story Œ

A: Œ in Œ I Œ I have those papers somewhere. And she Œ she was tiny, but she kept 
the entire large family together. And she was never going to go to 
Germany

everything German. But then she got this offer to go to 
Fulda

recreating the Hebrew school that the y went t o. There weren™t any Jews left, but Œ 

but

Q: I know. But do you remember what decade it was? Was this t he 70s, or the 80s?  
A: We just went through that. 

Q: I think we did, but I™d like to ground this chronologically. Was this where you 

said your daughter was three years old, and now she™s Œ 
A2: It was 1987. 
Q: 1987. Okay. So 19 eight Œ 

A: And that was actuall y very meaningful for everybody. 

A2: It was Œ we went back in May of 1987. 

Q: And did you Œ was t his the first time you were back in 
Germany
?  
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. Okay. So tell me about t hat trip.  
A: Well, first of all, it was really i nteresting, because m y aunt, who said she™d never 
go, since I was free, and Œ her fami ly was goi ng. There were a whole lot of us. A lot 

of her sisters and brothers of m y family. We Œ we were a whole group. And it Œ it 

was very meaningful to the family as a group, because you know, 
Steven
 
came, m y 
cousins from Œ 
Berta
™
s
(ph)
 
own children cam e. Other chil dren from these 11 
offspring came. And Œ and it was very wel l organized. I mean, we m et in the

Q: Yes. 
A: Œ it was interesting. 

Q: Yes, it™s a pretty cit y. 

A: Because, you know, it wasn™t really demolished, I mean, so it had a lot of the 

original history. And so many people came from 
Israel
, from all  over the place. 
And then there™s just a small, funny aside, and a lot of religious peopl e cou Œ course 
it was Œ the mayor, and another person who™d come from
 Israel
, I mean, they Œ 
they worked it out. And the people who went to this school were paid for, but all the 

relatives who came, we all paid for ourselves. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So it turned out to be a much bigger group than they were expecti ng.
 Lufthansa 

ca
-catered the kosher food. That t o me was such an irony, because they were 
unprepared for, you know, the many people that would show up. 
Q: Wow.

Steven

A: For me it was meani ngful because I had refused to speak German. In fact, I 
didn™t Œ I never talked it. So when we got the first day Œ 
I had a ca 
Œ bad Œ m y aunt 
had a daughter who was very interested in keeping in touch with whatever groups 

there were. Unfortunat el y, she™s not alive any more. But she had written to 
J udith 

Miller

O ne by One by One
.ﬂ 
A: Right. Who happened to be in 
Germany
 covering the 
Nuremberg 
trials, or 
something. And she showed up the next da y, came up to me, and said, can you t ell 
me who 
Nancy Kamp
(ph) is, m y cousin is, and I said yes, she™s over there. 
So  
Judith Miller
 talked to 
Nancy
. Really liked 
Steven
 because he was young, and not 
an old refugee, and cottoned onto him. I think he Œ he Œ you were at 
Harvard 
at  the 
time, right?  
A2: Yeah. 
A: So Œ you know, so she held onto me, and to 
Steven

the German, but I definitely was able to translate. 

Q: It™s interesting too, t hat when you went to li ve with your relatives once you 
arrived in 
Brooklyn
, that that means you didn™t speak German with each other at 
home. You must have spoken Engl ish. 
A: We did.

that happen?  
A: It Œ there  was a l ot of Œ more people that  were m y aunt™s vintage.

A: Cause you know, I was really Œ

was very meaningful was, we went  Œ again, the members of my family, i ncluding Œ

A2:

 t hat woman.

A2: Yes. 
Q: And your mom wanted also to have you share what your experiences were at 

that point, and particul arly in the home that used to belong to the 
Lump
 
family, 
because that was your grandmother™s mai den name. Okay, so take it from there. 

A2: Oka y, great. 
[break]
 

Q: Oka y 
Steve
,so tell us. Whatdo you 
remember from that? 
A2: Oh, so this was 1987, so how long ago was that? 

Q: Thirty years. 

A2: Thirty years ago. I remember Œ I remember it pretty vividly. There was a large 

group, and the town, and the press really be yond the town, in 
Germany
, I guess this 
was a ti me when there was a lot of interest in 
Germany
 about Jews coming back to 
visit. And I remember getting off the plane when we first arrived i n 
Germany
, and 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
94
 
departing off the plane with my mother and the whole group. And there were news 
cameras recor
ding us getting off the plane, and it was a li ttle jarri ng, and Œ  
Q: You didn™t expect that. 

A2: Not at all. And then Œ and then the next day we looked, and you know, the Œ the 

local 
TV 
station, and I think even beyond the l ocal 
TV
 station had, you know, news 
reports about the Jews of 
Fulda
 coming back. And I must say, i t was quite 
arresting, because I-I have never real ly f -felt so much like, you know, the Jews 
coming back, it was just weird to be Œ 

Q: In a group like t hat? 

A2: Œ in a group li ke that, and I guess the Œ
 Fulda
 had had a large Jewish 
population before and during the war, that  there were Œ  

A: Very Orthodox. 
A2: I think when we came back, there were 60,000 people in the t own of 
Fulda
, 
and ma ybe 30Jews.
 
Q: Who st Œ who were local there, and lived there. 

A2: Yes, i n other words, the population had gone from 1200 to 30. 

Q:Twelve hundred in 19 
Œ  
A2: Probably 1200 to zero, and then some came back, but Œ  

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
95
 
Q: All right. So 1200 pre-war, and t o the Œ okay. Did you meet any of the local 
Jews who Œ who stayed and lived in 
Fulda
? 

A: No. 

A2: I don™t  remember doing that. 

A: I don™t think there were any. 
A2: Yeah, I don™t Œ I don™t think there were Œ 
Q: Oka y. Any of the 12, for exampl e. 
A2: I Œ I Œ m y beli ef is that there were no Jews that survived in 
Fulda
, that some 
had come back Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A2: Œ between the end of the war and 1987. But 30, that™s not a huge number. 

Q: No, 30 is not a lot. 
A2: And the town made a big effort, and the ma yor of the town, who I think later 
hada more prominent political, you know,
 career in ger Œ 
in modern 
Germany
, had 
Œ one of his initiatives was to try and rebui ld a  temple in 
Fulda
, asa way of 
emphasizing, you know, a new Œ a new post-Nazi view, and Œ and I think he was 

the one behi nd organizi ng Œ 

A: Right.

A2: Œ the Jews in 
Ful
da
 to return. But it Œ it was Œ it was very int ensel y personal for 
m y mother and her family and our family, but you couldn™t miss the fact that it had 
this political significance. The wa y it was covered by the press. Frankl y, the 

security. It was a lit tle eerie, because everywhere we went, it was fairly subtle, but 

there was Œ 
Q: Coverage. 
A2: Well, there was coverage, but we had arm ed military, not just local police, but 

Œ 

Q: To protect you? 

A2: T Œ yes. Because t here was the belief Œ I think 
Germany
 felt that there was al l 
Œ you know, in 1987, t here were a variety of Œ 

A: Anti-Semitism left, do you thi nk? 
A2: I think there was t hat, I think there was just terrorism. 
Q: Yeah, it could have very well been, yeah. 

A2: There was a lot of Œ 

Q: There was the Israel i Œ I don™t know what year that Œ that massacre happened i n 

mu 
Œ in 
Munich
, but it mi ght have been in the 80s, during, I think the Olympics? 
A2: Well, that happened previously Œ  

Q: Previously. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
97
 
A2: Œ but t here were Œ there was Œ it wasn™t necessarily German anti-Semitism, I 
think there was a fear that Œ 

A: A lot of unrest, I guess. 

A2: Well,in midde 
Œ t here Œ 
you know 
Œ  
Q: Mideast terrorism. 
A2: Exactly. So, and I think 
Germany
 felt, and the ma yor felt that, to invite the 
Jews back to 
Fulda
, make a big statement about reconciliation, and have a terrorist 
incident, would not be a good thing. But the Œ but the level of security, ma ybe it 

wasn™t necessary, and Œ but it was Œ it added a level of Œ 

A: Drama, I think. 

A2: Œ drama, to something that was already prett y dramatic. But, for example, when 

we went to the Œ 
A: Castle?  
A2: Well, not the ca Œ when we went to the ceremony, to dedicate the reopening of 

the synagogue in 
Fulda
 Œ I don™t know if you remember that, there was Œ it was Œ 
there was an open st reet, and the y Œ they had Œ they had a Œ you know, si Œ I don™t 

know if it was buses, or cement trucks, but  they had Œ the y had obstacles closing off 

the street, t o make sure that Œ th Œ you know, i f you looked Œ it was subtle, but if 
you looked carefully, t he level of security was Œ 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

Q: It was t here. 
A2: I-It wasn™t just  local police, it was way beyond that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A2: And, you know, it was Œ it was Œ you know, it wa Œ it wa Œ it was a f Œ it was 

just int Œ i t was just a li ttle unnervi ng, really. So I remember that. I remember bei ng 
shocked, be cause I t hought I knew my mother. How old was I? I was probably in 
law school at the time, so in m y mid-20s. I had never really heard m y mother speak 

German. I didn™t think she spoke German. And the second Œ  

Q: And then all of a sudden Œ 

A2: All of a sudden, as she said, I Œ  

A: As 
Judith
 sa yi ng was Œ what™s he sa ying, and 
Steven
, what™s he saying? 
A2: And then m y mother started translating. And then people Œ we would be goi ng 
somewhere, and we would try and be lost, and my 
mother would stop andask 
someone in German what the directions were, and seemed to converse Œ 
Q: Wow.
 

A2: Œ completely i n German.  

A: You know, that was really a shock to me. 

A2: Yeah. I t was kind of amazing. So I remember that. I think Œ you know, it was 
a 

little Œ I-I-I think for a l ot of the people in t he fami ly, i-i-it ™s al most as if they Œ 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

there was this mind shi ft, where suddenly, you know, you felt what it must have 
been like to be there Juden, you know, and like different in this place. And you 

know, it was touching, but it was j ust Œ it  Œ it was just Œ I think it affected everyone 

very deeply. The wa y you suddenly started speaking German, you know, everyone 

reacted differently. 
Batta
(ph), who my mother was talking about. 
Q: Aunt 
Bertha
(ph). 
A2: Aunt 
Bertha
(ph). 
A: She was interviewed in the radio. 
A2: Yeah. 

Q: Oh, was she? 

A: Yes. She was prominent, this 
Judith Miller
 Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ covered her. 
Q: But she was the one who was so set against going. 

A: Yes, totally. 

Q: And when she actuall y did go, and was interviewed, what was i t that she said? 

What was it  that she Œ did that change, I mean, clearly? 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017

A2: I think the local radio station wa Œ you know, she was one of the people the y 
interviewed about comi ng back. You know, 
Bertha
(ph) was very Œ is Œ was Œ as 

m y mother said, very slight. 

Q: Yeah. 

A2: Very magnetic, big personality. And Œ and she wasn™t trying to be a big 
personality, she was Œ she just Œ  
Q: She was being herself. 

A2: She was being herself, and it wa Œ it was, you know, magnet ic. She wasn™t 

bitter, but she was very straightforward about things, and she didn™t sugarcoat it. I 

don™t remember the int erview, cause it was in German, and I didn™t understand t hat. 

But I Œ 
Iremember very wellthat we were in acoffee
 shop. 

A: Listeni ng to her. 
A2: We were sitting around a table with her, and it was j ust a small group, and she 
was describing a Œ a very bad incident, in which Œ 

A: Her sist er was Œ  not raped, but Œ by a German. Is Œ isn™t Œ isn™t that what it was? 
A2: The one I remember is where j ust the Jews in Œ in 
Fulda
 were being rounded 
up, and that  the local people, the y had had good friends, but thei r Œ t he local Œ t here 

was a mob that was sort of Œ 

A: Not Œ not sympathetic. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
101
 
A2: Just sort of cheering on the Nazis, you know. 
Q: As the y™re rounding the people up, mm-hm. 

A2: Yes. And 
Bertha
(ph) was speaking about  it, you know, very directl y, pretty 

you know, angrily, but just matter of fact. And I remember it was j ust jarring, 

because he we are sitt ing, listening to her, and there was like a tabl e adjacent to it, 
with like a Œ  
A: I don™t remember that. 
A2: Œ 
a 
Œ a German woman, who was of sort of a similar age. And she just had t his 

like stricken look on her face. You know, j ust sort of horribly upset to be hearing 

this, and it  was just interesting. Bat  Œ
 
Bertha
(ph) was not aware of thi s other person 
who was li ke overheari ng and listening. But it just struck me that 
Bertha
(ph) was 
telling her story, and this woman was Œ 
I don™t  
Œ I couldn™t read her mind, but it 
seemed like some combination of just bei ng horribly upset Œ but  not necessarily 

sympatheti c, just upset that someone was stirri ng up the pot, you know. D-
Do you 

understand?  

Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 talking about that, yeah. 
A2: So I remember that . 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
102
 
A2: And then the one other memory Œ 
many, 
but one memory I have i s that m y 
mother had spoken so much about visiting her grandmother, and in the bed, in that 
house. And Œ so I remember at some point  Œ 

A: A group of us went. 

A2: Œ said, well let ™s go, I mean, let™s see if it™s still there. 
Q: Let™s see the old house, yeah. 
A2: Is it st ill there? And s Œ 

Q: Do you remember t he street it was on? What the name of the street it was on? 

A2: You know, it was chronicled i n this book, so I™m gonna Œ I don™t know if the y 

have the address, I don™t think so. 

Q: 
Oka y.The y may not.
 

A2: So we went there, I think we t ook a cab there, maybe Œ 
A: I know a group of us went.  
A2: Œ 
was bi 
Œ might have been even two cabs. And we went out and we went and 
we got out and found it . And it was not Œ there was plenty of local press in 
Ful da
 
about this event, and the mayor inviting the Jews back, so it was Œ  
A: This we just did on our own.  

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

103
 
A2: But it was na Œ 
it wa 
Œ it wouldn™t Œ it would Œ you know, it would be ob Œ it 
would be very likely that any resident would know that this group had come back, 
you know.  

Q: Oka y, so it would have been in t he news. 

A2: Yes, absolutely, 
TV
, news Œ  
A: But it wasn™t. 

A2: No, the Jews of 
Fulda 
coming back was i n the news.  

A: Oh yes, of course. 

A2: So we get out of the cab, it™s maybe Œ I don™t remember that Œ I remember it 

was a morning. 

Q: And what did the house look like? 

A2: It was a nice enough house, it was bi g. 
Q: Stucco?  
A2: I think it was stucco, but I don™t remember it very wel l. What I remember is, 

there were shutters. 

Q: Singl

A: Well,it wasn™t very biganywa y.
 
Q: Oka y, oka y, I™m just trying to get sen Œ

Q: Oka y. 
A2: Single family. So I remember we were like looking, and peeri ng around, and I 

remember someone went to the back and said, oh look, the barn™s still there, or 

something like that. And then the shutters open a little bit , and someone looks out 

from the second floor, and then the shutters close again. And then that happened 
like two or three ti mes. And I think we rang on the doorbell. No one answered. And 
then we rang the doorbell a-again, and a wom an opened t he door, and she was Œ it Œ 

the whole dynamic real l y suggested that t he person there j ust really didn™t want 

these visit ors and woul d Œ would like them to go away, and Œ 

A: Right. 

A2: Œ didn™t want to have anything to do with this. And I don™t remember who Œ  

A: One of my uncles, I think. 
A2: Œ 
said hey, 
you know, we don™t want anyt hing, but we Œ 
yo u 
Œ this used to be a 
fa
mily house, we have a lot of memories from the house. Would it be oka y if we 
just Œ 
A: She was very rel uct ant. 

A2: She di dn™t like that idea at all, and she finally allowed, I think, a Œ 
a f 
Œ the 

group to come in, i n like stages. And I Œ I remember going in wit h you, and first of 

all, to me Œ well, I didn™t really remember the details of the house. I remember the 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

106
 
details of the reaction t his woman had, because you Œ you couldn™t fail, just based 
on her age and her reactions, to t hink that  thi Œ that this w as the person who Œ 
A: Who took over. 

A2: Œ who owned the house after Œ 

Q: After you all eit her were thrown out or left, or whatever, however. 
A2: When i t was taken. 
Q: Œ was taken Œ 

A: Everybody would Œ everyone had gone m y Œ to the contra Œ concentration camp.  

A2: And I think t hat the local Gestapo, or local party, you know, would Œ you 

know, desi gnate who could take over, so i t was often people who were, you know Œ 

A: Connect ed. 

A2: Œ friends of the Nazi party. 
Q: These are suppositi ons, but this is what comes through your mind as you™re Œ 
A2: No, I remember someone telling me at the Œ cause I remember after it, thinki ng 

like Œ asking like, how is it Œ how di Œ when a house got vacated, who determined 

who got it.  

Q: Got it, oka y. 

A2: And so someone se Œ told me, well, this is how it usually worked. 

Q: Oka y.

A2: That it Œ that i t was Œ the party would allocate who got it, or i t was put up for 
auction, but the auct ion was rigged, you know. 

Q: So how did this lady react? 

A2: So, this is the part I remember. And then, if it™s all right, because this was a 

while ago, t his reporter m y mother mentioned, did write a book about  it. We found 
the passage. So I™ll tell you what I remember, and then I™ll  Œ I™ll read you what Œ 
Q: The passage was. 

A2: Yeah. 

Q: Sure. 

A2: 
Which hopefully 
Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A2: Œ matches up a littl e bit. 
Q: Oka y. 
A2: I remember going t o the room that m y mother had described Œ cause I would 

ask her, wel l what Œ  what™s your memory of your grandmother. And t his was Œ

of reacting very greatly to like, thi s is exact Œ i t doesn™t look anyt hing like Œ all the

Q: The room. 

A2: Œ the room. This is the room where I woul d sa y Œ  

A: And thi s big cross. 
A2: Yes. And you told me, the one thing that™s different is, there is Œ t here was thi s 
huge cross that would have been like, over the bed Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A2: Œ you know. So I remember that, but t he t hing that I remember the most is t hat 

you know, every Œ 
the group 
Œ everyone was aware that this woman didn™t have to 
let us in, you know, we had asked if we could see it, and everyone was trying to

kind of Œ and it was clear that sh Œ who Œ di Œ who Œ everyone sensed that she had 
this feeling like oh, they™re going to take it  away, they™re going to take the house 
away from me, or something. So we were trying very hard to be like reassuring, and 

you know, kind of very appreciative that she was letting us see the house. And the 

rest of my mother and the relatives were sort of going back, looki ng t hrough the 
house, and she kind of turned to me, and I was kind of more wa Œ I was kind of 
running int erference. I was like tal king to her, and letting everyone el se see the 

house. And there wa Œ and I said, t hank you for letting us see the house, it really 

means a lot, you know. And she said, it™s oka y. And then there was a silence. And 

then she looked at me, and she looked down, and she said, you know, these shoes 

are terrible. These shoes hurt so much. I cannot get a pair of shoes that fit me, and I 

have a ki Œ you know, m y feet really ache, it™s very hard t o walk. I™m so 
uncomfortable, m y 
Œ it ™s very uncomfortable m y f Œ terri ble, m y shoes really hurt. 
A: I don™t remember that at all.  

A2: And I said Œ I said, oh yeah, it™s a shame, I™m sorry, you know, t hat happens. 

And she ki nd of went on with shoes, it™s terrible, these shoes, they Œ  

Q: Well, there™s a si gni ficant moment. She realizes who the peopl e are who have 

come back, and instead of somehow or ot her acknowledgi ng this significant

moment, t his is what she is Œ this is what Œ how she is able to handle it, in other 
words. Or not handle it. 

A2: I Œ look, I Œ 
we
 
couldn™tread her mind.
 
Q: Of course not. 

A2: But, I- I believe that she was Œ 
A: She was asking you to give some mone y for shoes? 
A2: No, no, no, I don™t think that at all. 

Q: I mean, t hat thought  crossed m y mind, too, ma ybe.  

A2: No, I Œ she Œ I didn™t think she was asking, I think she was feeli ng extremely 

uncomfortable. I th Œ I took it that she felt Œ well, let me go on, and then I™ll tell you 

what Œ 

Q: Sure. 
A2: Œ how I Œ how Œ I™ll Œ I™ll just tell you the facts. 
Q: 
How you 
Œ how you took it
,  yeah
.  
A2: And t hen I™ll tell you how I t ook it. 

Q: Right. 

A2: It was very odd for us to be there, and for her to be Œ she wasn™t sayi ng, give 

me mone y for a new pair of shoes. She was sayi ng, it™s terrible, t hese shoes, the y Œ  
Q: Yeah, they kind of hurt, yeah. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

111
 
A2: Œ they don™t fit, it really hurts. And then I said, well, that™s a shame, you know, 
thanks agai n, it™s a very nice house. And then she said, oh, the house. It™s Œ 
it™s very 

hard to mai ntain. There™s lots of difficult y. It Œ 
you 
Œ there™s always something t hat 
has to be fixed, and Œ 

A: All this is in German, and you understood i t? 
A2: It was broken, you know, but I understood it. And I Œ must have been in broken 
English, cause I di dn™t speak German, so Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A2: It must have been English. But she was sort of ex Œ she wa Œ the two things she 

communicated to me was, her shoes hurt, she was very uncomfortabl e, and the 

house is Œ is really a burden, but what can you do? And I was sort of ext Œ I was 

kind of nodding and, you know, kind of saying that, gee, that™s a shame. And I was 
thinking to myself, you know, you™re Œ you seem Œ oh, I remember, there was one 
other thing. I said l ike, oh, you know, how long have you lived here? And she said, 

oh, you know, a very l ong ti me. And I said oh, like when Œ like, since when? And 

she said oh Œ she didn™t  Œ she said a lon Œ you know, had it for a long time. I do Œ  

and then she said something very vague. And so I combi ned that with her obvious 

discomfort, and her saying that the house was a burden, and I thought it was Œ I 

thought she was Œ I took it to mean that she was dealing with, you know, 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

ambivalence, and guilt, and discomfort at t he part Œ I believe that somehow, some 
way, she was part of st ealing the house. Or wi th Œ 
youknow, or was complicit with 
the Nazis, and that now the people who had been the victi ms of this act were back, 

and you know, she Œ  

Q: Unexpectedly. 
A2: Œ unexpectedly. 
Q: Yeah. 

A2: And I think she was feeling Œ and I thi nk t hat she realized no one was going to 

be making a claim against her. This was simpl y us remembering t he Œ the place 

where we had been harmed, and exiled, or m y family had been. And I don™t think 

she could handle it. So I think the wa y she handled it was to sa y, this i s really 

uncomfortable, these shoes really hurt. Och, it™s terrible. My poor Œ I Œ 
Q: My poor feet, yeah. 
A: I don™t remember that at all.  

A2: And I remember just being floored by it. 

Q: Well, ee Œ as I said, it sounds like a very Œ such a bizarre kind of statement at t he 

significance Œ even if it™s not her significance, but significance to people who have 

come to her door, and that her mind woul d not be on, why is this significant for 

them, but on something like this.

A2: You™re going t o uh-oh, who Œ   
Q: Yeah. 

A2: And then I remember one more thing, she said to me, so Œ and you know, m y 

mother mentioned t hat the Nazis very often thought she was a good Aryan girl. 

Q: Yeah. 
A2: And Œ  right Œ 
A: Yeah. 

A2: Œ when you were Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A2: Œ when the y would hide Œ hand you t he fliers. 

A: Right. 

A2: And I™ve had that experience, cause I am told I don™t  look particularly Jewi sh, 
whatever that means. And so, she did turn to me, and said, but you™re not a 
Lump
.  
Q: That is the ma Œ 
A2: You™re not a 
Lump
, are you?  
Q: That is the maiden name of your mother. 

A: Right. 

Q: You™re not a

Q: So, clearly Œ 
A2: No, you™re not . You™re not one of them, right? 

Q: So she knew who was the family who lived there before. 

A: Yes. 

Q: She knew that it had been the 
Lumps
.  
A2: She said, but you™re not Œ you™re Œ you™re Œ you™re just taking them, right? And 
I said no, no, that™s my mother. And then she didn™t know how to answer that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A2: So, ma y I read this? Would that make sense? 

Q: Please. Please read t his, mm-hm. 

A2: Because I just think it™ll Œ 

Q: Sure. 
[i ndecipherable]
 
A2: Œ add a little color, and then I™l l leave you, you know. 

Q: So this is Œ this is from 
Judith Miller
, her book, ﬁ
One by One by One
.ﬂ She 
was a ﬁ
New York Times
,ﬂ reporter Œ  

A: Right. 

Q: Œ who 
[indecipherable]
 on thi s.  
A2: She Œ she wrote Œ she wrote t he book in 1990. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
115
 
A2: So it came out  a little after this. 
Q: Right. 

A2: But at the time in 
Euro pe
, t here was a phrase that a lot of people used, called 
Holocaust amnesia, because there were in the Œ in the social discussion and in t he 

politics of 
Europe
 at that time, there was Œ not  holo Œ you know, there was amnesia 
ab
out it. And so 
Judith Miller
 Œ th-th Œ the premise of this book was that, to 
counteract Holocaust amnesia, she would tell not the large histori cal story, but 

specific detailed stories. 

Q: Individual stori es. 

A2: That™s why it™s cal led, ﬁ
One by One by One
.ﬂ  
A: And she was coveri ng some trial in 
Germany
, and m y cousin had written to her, 
and that™s why she came. 
Q: Oka y. 
A2: And so, a chapter in the book chronicled her accompanyi ng this group to 

Fulda
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A2: So that™s kind of the background. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
116
 
A2: And so I™m just reading from it, because i t™s the same incident with Œ but a little 
more cotemporaneous, I guess.  

Q: Oka y. 

A2: So it says: ﬁBut with the surfacing of good memories, came the bad and the 

ambivalent. One day, for example, some of the 
Lumps
 mustered the courage to 
visit their former home. It had been occupied for years by a woman, now very ol d, 

whose husband had probably bought it at aucti on from the Nazis.ﬂ Presumably, the 

author of this book researched it, and got her own information. ﬁShe let us enter i n 

stages, said 
Doris Fingerhood
, 
Rosie
™
s 
daughter, who had left 
Germany
 for 
England
 when she was 11 years ol d. The house looked physically much as I 
remembered it, only m uch smaller. I kept t hinking, where did m y parents put 11 

children? But I had remembered the house as full of character, now it was 
peculiarly devoid of any. The woman who owned it,ﬂ Œ this is m y mother speaking 
Œ ﬁthe woman who owned it was 80. She kept saying that she had lived there for 20 

years, but knew not hing about how her husband, who was dead, had acquired it. She 

was crusty, and very formal, typically German. I didn™t know what to believe, and 

that made me uncomfortable. She comp Œ she complained about her health, about 

the cost of keeping up the house. It  was so expensive to maintain t hat she couldn™t 

travel, 
Doris
 said. Finall y, she looked at 
Steven
 and me, at our bl ondi sh hair and

blue e yes, and said, you don™t look like t he 
Lumps
. There was a final shock 
awaiting them. 
Regina
™
s 
bedroom was virtual ly unchanged from 
the day she had 
died there, with one exception. Over what had been the 
Lump
 family™s old double 
bed hung a large wooden cross. I™m glad m y mother coul d not see it, 
Doris
 said 
softl y.ﬂ And then it goes on to talk about other things. 
Q: That™s true. 

A2: So 
that™sthe history of 
Œ  
Q: That™s t he history from different voices, your voice, your voice Œ 

A: And her voice. 

Q: Œ and jud Œ 
and her voice 
Œ and 
Judith Mil ler
™
s 
voice. 
A2: Yeah. 

Q: I mean, one of the things that I™d like t o ask both of you, and this touches Œ I 
mean, your 
Œ your story on this t ouches on that, and that™s that theme of, what do 
contacts wit h Germans, ethnic Germans, non-Jews, what kind of cont acts are there, 
so many years after the war, and what kind of feelings do the y leave you with? And 

I™ll preface that also with a thought. I usually t ry not to be leading, but I get the 

impression, after talking to so many people, that one of the most difficult aspects in 

this story is Œ the large story, is the loss of trust, and can trust ever be regained? And 

I wonder if that plays a role here. So there™s really two questions. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
118
 
A: Well, I don™t think I can answer that, but I can tell you for my aunts and uncles, 
like 
Julius
, who was a big football player, and Œ 

A2: Soccer.  

A: Œ older Œ or soccer, or whatever he did. But the y met Germans whom the y knew, 

and the y made it possible Œ the y had teas, or coffee, or you know, they had Œ they 
met  that ol der group, with other ol der groups, and they actually interact Œ acted. 
Now, I wasn™t part of that, but they had the opportunity to meet peopl e that they 

knew when they were younger, and growi ng up. 

Q: During this tri p to ful Œ  

A: During this tri p to 
Fulda
. Th- There were definite meeti ngs, when the Germans 

could meet the people l ike m y relatives who had lived in 
Fu
lda
. How it went, I 
can™t really t ell you. 
A2: You don™t remember any comment? 
A: I think some were quite positi ve. 

A2: I think so too. 

Q: Oka y. And what about your own feeling? 

A: Well, I j ust Œ m y own feeling was that  the ma yor, and whoever t he powers-
to
-be 
who had arranged this, did a very good job, because it seemed successful. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
119
 
A2: That™s true, but you™re not answering how Œ the question is like, how did it 
leave you, in terms of feeling you could trust people or not? 

A: I was just glad I wasn™t there any more. I mean, I Œ I di dn™t like 
Germany
, I 
didn™t like the at mosphere. 

Q: Even then, in 1987, in 
Fulda
.  
A: Right. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But I was glad I was there, that I could absorb. Like we went to my 

grandmother™s grave, and that was very i mportant to me. I was glad t o have the 

connection more
 personally, but I wouldn™t want to be there.
 
Q: Oka y. So, in that sense, what was broken couldn™t real ly be repaired. 

A: No. 
Q: What about you? 
A2: Well, I kind of had to somewhat Œ 

Q: And I™m not just talking about the 
Fulda
 trip, but if that is the catalyst, if that™s 
the only ti me you were there Œ 

A2: No, I™ve been t here s-since. 

A: But not in that context. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
120
 
A2: No, not in that context. You know, I think that Œ I think that i t™s Œ I don™t Œ I- I 
think two t hings. I don™t think it™s a Œ I don™t t hink it™s nearly as si mple as, the 

Germans did something bad to the Jews. That ™s certainly t rue, but  it™s also true Œ 

although it ™s horrific to sa y Œ that t here were Gentile friends of 
Rose 
and
 Leo
 who 

risked their lives to save Œ to hide them, until 1944. And the Œ 
they 
Œ they perished 
instead of surviving the war, because of a f Œ fellow Jew, who Œ who ratted them 
out, you know. 

A: So it™s very complicated. 

A2: So I don™t think Œ 
I 
Œ if there™s an us versus them, it Œ it™s not Germans versus 
Jews, you know. SoI™m 
Œ but, you know, I don™t think Œ it™s one thi ng to read about 

horrible things in t he paper, or in history books, but when you see it t hrough your 

own family, or your mother or grandparent s, it™s very dark. And t he i dea that 
neighbors didn™t know what was going on, to me is Œ 
A: Hard to believe. 

A2: Œ is nonsense. And Œ and it Œ to me, it  was the little things, li ke the reaction of 

this woman, that just betrayed the fact that Œ you know, t here was lots of compli city 

in Œ in bad acts. And so, I don™t feel like, oh I can™t trust Germans. And I™ve been to 

Germany
 a lot, and Œ 
Q: Since then? 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
121
 
A2: Yes. And you know, in the modern wor Œ I mean, the interesting thing, by t he 
way, is that  one big contingent of visitors on this trip to 
Fulda
 were Germans who 
had emigrated to 
Israel
. And the y Œ and you know, 
Israel
 and 
Germany
 
have a 
very functional relati onship right now. And 
G ermany
 is i mportant to 
Israel
™
s 
economy. And what I found interesting was that the Israeli s had Œ had gotten over 
this a long ti me ago. Israelis did not exhibi t a lot of ambivalence, or Œ 
A: Interesti ng. 

A2: Œ you know, emotional compl ication. American Jews did. Israeli Jews had 

other problems. 

Q: So, that ™s also interesting.  

A2: So I-
I guess 
Œ  first of all, 
[indeciphera ble]
 fascinated Œ 
A: That™s very interesti ng. I didn™t  even think about that. 
A2: But, I mean, what I want to sa y is like I Œ I found it scarring. I found the 
experience scarring, you know, just kind of feeling like I was reli ving through my 

mother, you know, or her relatives, l ike what had happened. I think it was a hugely 

traumatic thing. And I t hink everyone has, you know, lived remarkabl y good lives, 

given such a rip in the entire family support syst em, fabric. And look, that happened 

to a lot of  people in that time, but this was real l y acute. 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
122
 
Q: One reason that I ask that, is t hat willy or nilly, we are having t his conversation 
several generations after the events. And the fact that we have it so many years, 

decades after the events, when there a
re several 
Œ that influences us. How you speak 

of something Œ you don™t have different facts, but how you speak of the facts 10 

years afterwards, two years afterwards, and 50 years afterwards, changes somewhat, 
is influenced by things. And toda y, there are young Germans who, I™ve heard often 
say 
Œ and it™s not t he onl y voice. It ™s not the onl y voice, but they say, this happened 
such a long ti me ago. This has not hing to do with me. Why can™t I be taken by who 

I am 
Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ rather than by all t his? Why do I have to apologize for somet hing that even not 

m y parents did, but maybe even my grandparents didn™t? And part of why I™m 
asking these questions is to provi de a window to what makes Œ if that is the case, or 
not, you know? Does that Œ 

A2:Let me take
 that  point and narrow it into like a very specific mini-example, 

cause I understand t hat feeling. So when we were on this trip, m y mot her said, this 

at the beginning, 
Lufthansa 
provided transportation, or was part of it, and there was 

a sizable contingent of people who were kosher, who were Orthodox and kosher. 

And the Œ some of the events that someone in 
Germany
 catered was, the y had to 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
123
 
provide kosher food. Wel l, there are, you know 30 Jews in Œ i n Œ in 
Fulda
 
at the 
time, and it  was a Œ  it was a productio
n. And Idon™treally know howtheydid it, 
cause we don™t keep kosher, but I think it involved getting food from, you know, 

further away places. And I remember at one of these events, speaking not to a 

dignitary or anything like that, just to some Œ some kind of a guy who was working 
Œ I forget if he was part of the catering, or part of 
Lufthansa
, but he was one of the 
people that arranged for this food to be provided to the kosher people. And I was 

making Œ you know, I was sort of just having casual conversation wit h him, sort  of, 

because it was Œ I w Œ i t was just i nteresti ng to me that thi-this was like a very Œ I 

was part of this visible, the Jews of 
Fulda
 back there. And I said something like 

wow, quite an event, and I think he spoke reasonable enough English. And he said 

yes. And he said, you know, it™s Œ  he basically said it™s really very expensive, and 
very difficult to have to get this kosher food. And it™s really a big production, and 
we Œ he Œ 
I don™tthink he 
Œ he basi cally sai d, we have bett er things t o do. 
Q: Ah, so it was with this kind of attitude.  

A2: It was like Œ and Œ and I don™t think he was being angry, but it was very 

interesting, because his perception was exactly what you were sa yi ng about like 

why 
Œ I™m not res Œ his whole perception was, look, I-I™m a young person, I™m not 

responsible for whatever happened in the past. Somehow or another, we have to run 

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood  
 
April 27, 2017 
 
 
 
124
 
all over the place to get  this kosher food, for this group of people that are visiting. 
Why do we have to do this, you know? It™s a big Œ it™s a big Œ 

Q: Pain. 

A2: Œ burden. It™s a big pain. And I don™t get it. And so he was not, at all, welcome 

back, you know, I know a bad thing happened, we™re making a huge effort. It was 
more like, why the hell am I doing this? And I thought to m yself, wel l, you know, if 
Œ if this group hadn™t killed, or exi led these people, they would have t heir own 

thriving community, they could get their own kosher foods, so it™s reall y the least 

you can do, to be i nconvenienced. 

Q: Yeah. 

A2: So Œ but there are both sides, you know. I don™t know what t o say. 

Q: So you could see Œ you could see his point  of view. 
A2: I c Œ I understand someone sa yi ng, we didn™t do this. Hell, you Americans, I Œ 
what are you doing for the native American Indians, or you know, or Œ th
at™s your 

promise? And Œ so, I™m not particularly persuaded by that point  of view. 

Q: Yeah. No. 

A2: I was a little indignant by it. 

Q: Of course. 

A2: But I can understand it.  

 
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood

Q: Well, I mean, the question that I posed is one that I don™t think reall y has 
answers. 

A: I don™t think so either. 

Q: But the y are part of the realities, and there are very deep feelings on both si des. 

On all sides. There ma Œ someti mes are more t han two sides. 
A: You know what I™m noticing Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ the most is t hat the Germans t hat I™ve met toda y, the y alwa ys say, t hat wasn™t 

us, we had nothing to do with it. 

Q: And what does that do when you hear that? 

A: I don™t believe it . 

Q: Oka y. Okay. 
A: Do you have the same reaction? 
A2: I do. But I also have to say Œ 
I mean,I do, peri
od. But it makes me wonder 

what is happening now, under our own noses, that we™re not suf Œ attuned to 

enough, you know. 

A: Now, if you speak t o 
Kurt Œ 

Q: Yeah.

A: Œ he has many German connections, and he feels very differently. Really, he™s 
made a lot of co Œ he™s gone back and back and back. He™s made many connections, 

and he treasures the fri endships with Germans. 

Q: Yes. 

A2: I mean Œ 
Q: Thank you for bringing that in, because we™re talking Œ you Œ we™re talking 
individual s. I™m not Œ 
I™m ad 
Œ I™m sometimes reflecting something t hat™s in the air 
that™s not i ndividual, but people are Œ have their own way of processing that, their 
own wa y of responding to it. And it™s not a finished story. 

A: No. 

A2: I mean, I Œ I Œ I would just add one more thing Œ 

Q: Sure. 
A2: Œ and I am s Œ 
rem 
Œ so removed from it, but m y impression is that Œ you know, 
Weimar
 
Germany
, I guess, was really col lapsing. People turned to a strong, 
authoritarian dictator because the y thought  it was the only way t o get things done. 
And I think once 
Hitler
 Œ I think 
Hitler
 very quickly, you know, empowered the 
worst, lowest, most brutal, most cri minal elements. And I think once t hat happened,
