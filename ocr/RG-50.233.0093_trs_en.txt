Q: What kind of school did you attend? 

 

A: Was the Roma nian school up to 4
th
 gr ade.  Then in the 4
th
 grade, the Hungarians 
came in.  There was no school for two years 
because they didn™t allow the Jews to 
go to school.  The Christians didn™t go to
 school, very few of them went so two 

years later, they opened up the school again and they accepted the Jewish people 
but I didn™t go back any more because it 
was optional.  So I ne ver went back, you 

know kids, kids rather not go. 
 

Q: Yes.  Now when the schools were run 
by the Roma nians, did you experience anti-
Semitism or any kind of problems? 
 

A: No, not by the Roma nians. 

 

Q: The instruction was in Roma nian? 

 

A: In Romanian, Romanian teachers.  They
 brought them in from different cities.  
They were ve ry nice, the teachers, very nice.  They had no problems with them. 
 

Q: Who were the students in these schools? 

 

A: Mostly Jewish, mostly Jewish, ma ybe fi
ve of the Ukrainian children. That™s about 
all.  They didn™t go to school. 
 

Q: Your older brother and your olde
r sister went to the same  school? 
 

A: My sister.  My brother wa
s out of school.  He was already six years older than me  
and he was out of school.  
My sister went with me. 
 

Q: What did your father do for a living? 

 
A: My father worked at the railroad 
station, loading and unloading whatever was 
shipped in or shipped out, food.  We  
had a heavy wooded area; my section was 
the heavy wooded area so we shipped out 
a lot of wood.  Then we didn™t grow 
wheat or sugar or anything so everythi
ng had to be imported so everything was 
brought in.  He was at the 
railroad station, him a nd tw
o other me n.  That™s what 
they did. 
 
Q: Was he employed by the state railways or --? 

 

A: No, no.  He was employed by the people 
that got me rchandise, 
either shipped in 
or shipped out. 
 

Q: So he worked hard? 

 

A: He was a very hard worker.  Wa s like these people, what is it called now, people 
that exerci se with the machines, iron-something? 
 

Q: Oh, the weight lifters? 

 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: Pumpingiron? 

 

A: Pumping iron, that™s what he did. 

 

Q: Pumping iron, yes. 

 

A: Yes, pumping iron. 

 

Q: So he was a strong ma n? 

 

A: Yes, very strong ma n. 

 

Q: Now your mother had six children so she 
must have been working very hard at 
home? 
 

A: No, she was a dressmaker also and worked at that also. 

 

Q: In addition to raising six kids, she wa s a dressma ker? 

 

A: Yes, she was a dressmaker and she sewed quite a lot also. 

 

Q: At home  or at a shop? 

 

A: At home .  We had a sewing machine in th
e house and she sewed quite a lot.  I had 
to take care of the three little ones while she sewed. 
 

Q: So you were the baby sitter
, the resident baby sitter? 

 

A: I was the resident baby sitter.  When s h
e cooked too, I had to ta
ke care of the three 
little ones. 
 

Q: How about your older si
ster, what did she do? 
 

A: She helped cooking and cleaning and then 
she learned also to be a dressmaker.  
She had mor e  different job than me . 
 Everybody was assigned to some  job and 
that was my job, taking care of the little ones. 
 

Q: Did you have a garden with your house? 

 

A: Yes, we had a big garden right on the b
ack of our house and then we had two other 
fields right near our house to gr
ow corn and hay for the cow. 
 

Q: You had a cow?   Who did that work, your father? 

 

A: My father, that we all had to do.  I never milked a cow though.  I was afraid of 
that. 
 
Q: The cow was afraid of you too? 

 

A: I don™t know but I never milked a cow. 

 

Q: It sounds like you ate well? 

 

A: Yes, it was -- everything was very, very
 good.  Everything was ma de at that time , 
for when you are going to use it.  Ever
ything was fresh and everything was good 
until the Hungarians came in.  When the war broke out, the situation changed 

drastically.  Then you couldn™t get supplies,
 there was a shortage of everything so 
everything changed. 
 

Q: Now you mentioned that when the Hunga
rians came in, you were forced out of 
school.  Then you -- of course the war had meanwhile broken out.  Did your 

parents ever discuss politics 
or your older brother or sist
er ever discuss politics, or 
the Nazis.  Had you heard of
 the Nazis and Hitler?   
 

A: Well, let™s say like when the Hungarians came in, they kind of ma de us use, have 
flags and greet the soldiers in and praise 
them.  Of course we didn™t want to; right 
away we knew the Hungarians are not as
 good as the Roma nians and we were 
very upset.  When the Roma nians left, we 
were very much afraid that they are 
going to start some thing bad, the soldiers. 
 
Q: The Hungarian soldiers? 
 

A: The Roma nian soldiers. 

 

Q: The Romanian soldiers? 

 

A: The Roma nian soldiers when they ha
d to pull out but everything went very 
smoothly when they pulled out.  But when the Hungarian soldiers came  in, after 

they occupi ed and after a few weeks, 
they pulled out, they started fires. 
 

Q: The Hungarian soldiers started 
fires around Ruscova or in Ruscova? 
 

A: Yes, in Ruscova. 

 

Q: What was the purpose of that? 

 

A: I guess anti-Semitic, no other purpose.  But yet we were afraid of the Romanians 
and the Romanians didn™t do it.  I was very
 young at the time, you see.  I really 
wasn™t that much involved but I remember
 my mother like saying that we were 
afraid of the Roma nians and yet they
 didn™t do anything.  The Hungarians we 

weren™t afraid of because they rema ined. 
 They rema ined in Hungary and yet they 
did it anyway. 
 
Q: That™s interesting, that y
our parents would be afraid of
 the Roma nians.  Was there 
any --? 
 

A: We were afraid when they pulled out.  
As a ma tter of fact, we didn™t sleep in the 
house, we went to sleep in the fields when
 they pulled out.  That they going to do 
some  da ma ges and they™re going to do some  killing. 
 

Q: Vandalism?  

 

A: Killing, vandalism because they had to pull out for the Hungarians to come in.  I 
reme mber we were afraid and we didn™t 
sleep in the house and yet they didn™t do 
anything.  They just pulled 
out and everything was quiet. 
 

Q: Had you heard of Hitler at that time? 

 

A: Me, personally, no.  I didn™t.  It 
was a small town and nobody had a radio. 
 

Q: Noradio? 

 

A: So you had to depend on a newspaper, you didn™t get ma ny newspapers either.  
We were very remote, you know, we are twelve miles away from the Rus sian 

border, the _______.  It™s a remote place, we didn™t –.. 
 
Q: So you probably didn™t even know where Germany was. 
 

A: No, but we weren™t involved, as I 
say.  And even in 1942, even though it was 
Hungary, they were already 
taking away people that weren™t legally ma rried, from 
different towns and different 
cities, but some how our town 
they left alone.  They 
didn™t touch us until ™44. 
 

Q: So from 1940 when the Hungarians came 
in until 1944 they did little other than 
close down the schools. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And draft – 

 

A: Oh, no, no, no they did lots of other things. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: The Jews couldn™t, had to keep open th
e stores on Saturday and on holidays and 
then they had to hire, whether they needed
 them or not, a Christian person in the 

store to stay at the store.
  They didn™t leave you alone, they were, right away they 
showed their anti-Semitism 
in ma ny, ma ny ways.  But it wasn™t as bad as when 
they took us into the ghetto. 
 
Q: Now another thing you me ntioned earlier, 
your oldest brother he was drafted into 
the Hungarian army labor service. 
 

A: Yeah, labor service, right and he worked 
in the coal mi nes and then he worked in 
the battlefield, they didn™t let Jew fight, they couldn™t fight.  So he had to clean up 

the, after the battle, clean 
up the bodies.  That was his job and he got liberated by 

the Russians and six mo nths before, in
 ™44, 1945, I would say in January, six 
months before the war ended.  So he came back home  to Ruscova. 
 

Q: Now were there other changes under th
e Hungarians that you reme mber, other 
than the ones we™ve just me ntioned? 
 

A: Well, they came  around, the Germans cam
e around and they started to say they™re 
going to start a ghetto. 
 

Q: This is in 1944? 

 

A: In 19–before 1944. 

 

Q: The Germans came in before 1944? 

 

A: Germans came in and they said that they
™re going to have a ghetto, they™re just 
going to have us together, just for the durat
ion of the war, and then they planned a 
ghetto and then they ma de the ghetto and _______  
 

Q: Which is near where? 

 

A: Next town, it™s only a few miles 
away. But that was the nearest city. 

 

Q: _________ 

 

A: Uh,huh. 

 

Q: Did you do any traveling at all 
during these years 
as a young girl? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: So you were always in Ruscova. 

 

A: I was always in Ruscova. 

 

Q: How about any of your brot
hers and sisters, other than the brother who was in the 
Hungarian army, were there other me mbers of the fa mily? 
 
A: Well, my sister she was the one who went
 to Budapest, in ™42 or ™43, in between 
then she went to Budapest and she wa s a 
dressmaker so she was able to go there 
and work.  And then when it became so bad for the Jews she had these Christian 

friends and they got the Christian papers
 and she lived under the Christian name  

all those mo nths, but it was very, very st
ressful for her.  Very scary for her and 
one ma n found out she™s Je
wish and he was going to report her and she wa s 
hidden for three days, she was hidden and without food or drink or anything and 

she was very upset.  Finally she said sh
e doesn™t care, she has to give up and go 
out and see and go out because she can™t st ay ther e and what ill happen will 

happen.  She found out that her Christian friends were looking for her and they 

couldn™t find her.  That ma n that was goi
ng to report her, got killed by the first 
Russian bombs when the Russians started to 
invade Budapest.  He got killed with 
the first Russian bomb, s o she got saved. 
 

Q: She knew that?   Did she know that he™d been killed? 

 

A: After she got out, after the three days of
 hiding, she said she can™t stay there any 
more, she™s thirsty, she™s hungry, there is nothing there.  She got very scared, she 

says, they™ll send her to a concentration cam
p, they™ll send her if 
they catch her.  
There is nothing she could do any more.  So
 that™s when her friends told her, the 
Christian friends, ﬁI was 
looking for you, Lily, I was 
looking for you.  That ma n 
got killed with the first Russian bomb.ﬂ 
 
Q: Did she know how this guy knew she was Jewish? 
 

A: I really don™t know how he knew–.oh 
he kind of guessed, he kind of guessed. 
She didn™t look Jewish at all because she™s 
bl onde, and German she spoke.  So the 
blonde people and speaking German
, you could get away with it. 
 

Q: So your sister Lily could speak German?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Had she learned it in Ruscova? 

 

A: Yeah, we had a German fa mily there 
and, like I spoke to them too.  We  were 
friends with the kids and we spoke to
 them, so you picked up these languages 
from that area, which I forgot mo
st of he m because I don™t use them. 
 

Q: Was Lily able to send letters to Ruscova? 

 

A: Oh,no. 

 

Q: No, so there was no correspondence? 
 

A: But I knew where she lived so when I came back from the concentration camp I 
stopped off in Budapest and I found her.
 She lived at 31______, and it™s still 
there. 
 

Q: On the Pesht side of the river. 

 

A: Yes, when I went the last time I went to
 look at that street again at that house, I 
found it. 
 

Q: But until 1944, you living in this sma ll remote town, near the Carpathians, the 
Hungarian police are running the town? 
 

A: Well the Hungarian police and we had, 
I told you, the aristocratic Hungarian 
fa mily and they had a lot of children a
nd their children took over everything.  And 

everybody was kind of their slave, you had to
 do what they say, they said, and 

when you met any of them you had to say ﬁ____________ﬂ which you know what 

that means, ﬁI kiss your hand.ﬂ  And to 
the older ones, the elderly you had to go 
over and kiss their hand, if not they woul
d let your parents know that the children 
weren™t ni ce to them and they were very anti-Semitic, but when my brother came 

home  and two other guys came home , fr
om the ______ they were going to kill 
them.  So they took the Russian soldiers
 and they got afte
r them, but some how 
they found out and they all ran away and 
they don™t live in Ruscova any more, 
they live in _____.  
 
Q: So when the Hungarians took over this
 local Hungarian aristocrat became the 
ma ster of the area? 
 
A: The masters of the area. 

 

Q: In all probability, this 
same  fa mily controlled the area before the Roma nians took 
over in 1918. 
 

A: They owned a lot of property, a lot.  Th
ey happened to live ri
ght across the street 
from us, fortunate we were, huh?   But, so we
 had to be their slaves all the time .  I 
mean, whatever they wanted we had to
 do for them, baby sit, go shopping for 
them. 
 

Q: So you would describe them as anti-Jewish? 

 

A: Oh yes, and yet they were only friends 
with the Jewish people,
 they didn™t have 
other people to be friends with. 
 

Q: The Slovaks were pr
obably not their friends. 

 

A: They were too, very common people. 
 

Q: AndUkrainians. 

 

A: Very common people, they were not 
better class, so the only body they can 
mi ngle with was the Jews.  So, they were al
l very friendly with the Jews.  I played 

with thei r children and 
their grandchildren. 
 

Q: Until– 

 

A: Until– 

 

Q: Thedeportation. 

 

A: Yes, I played with them because they lived across the street and we were all 
friends.  My mother was very good friends with them. 
 

Q: Did she do sewing, dressmaking for t hem?  

 

A: Oh yes, they would pay in food, most  pe
ople paid in food -- b
eans, flour, potatoes, 
chicken. 
 

Q: Would you happen to reme mber their last name , this aristocratic family? 

 

A: You know, I really couldn™t tell you b
ecause we called them the Preesin.  You 
know what that means the Preesin?  It™s like a queen or a king. 
 

Q: Thelords? 

 

A: The lords, like.  That™s what we 
referred to them.  They™re all in ____ now 
because when I came home none of them were found, they were all gone.  They 

ran for their lives because  they knew what
 they did and they were afraid the 

Russians were going to get them.  One th
ing the Russians, they paid back for 
people, what they knew were bad. 
 

Q: Were there any Hungarian fasc
ists, He rrocross, in your town? 
 

A: No, the only thing what happened, I 
reme mber once, maybe they came the 
Herrocross or some body, they instigated 
those Christians there and for a little 
while they were very anti-Semitic, but
 then it calmed down.  Okay, like on 
Christma s and Easter we  would be afraid
 to go out, we kind of, even during the 
Roma nians we kind of didn™t go out too mu
ch be cause we were afraid of them, 
the Christians what they would do.  So we
 kind of stayed out of their way.  But 
otherwise they left us alone, they
 didn™t bother with us too much. 
 

Q: There weren™t any pogroms?  

 
A: No,never. 

 

Q: And you say you were told there w
ould be a ghetto some ti me  in 1943? 
 

A: They were comi ng to look who™s where, what, you know and the pity is we  had 
such deep hills we could have all hid a
nd they could have never found us.  It™s 
such big woods, nobody – 
 

Q: Did your parents ever consider emigrating? 

 

A: Many, ma ny years ago they considered em
igrating to Brazil, when Brazil opened 
kind of?   Or Argentina, I don™t reme mber 
the land.  But it fell through, they never 
did.  We  had our aunt here which was my 
father™s sister, so probably one of us 

would have come  eventually, one of 
the children.  And once one came, they 
brought out the rest. 
 

Q: And you we re still a little girl during 
these years, did you have any particular 
dreams about what you would do when 
you grew up or where you would go?   
 

A: Well, there was one thing I always used 
to think to myself that I™m going to work 
for whatever I need, but I want to have 
everything nice.  I was always thinking 
that to myself, that I like nice things and 
I would work for it.  And that™s what I™m 
doing, I™m still working to get whatev
er I like and whatever I want. 
 

Q: How about your sister Lily now, she act
ually grew up and went to Budapest, did 
she have particular goals in
 mi nd, particular job or – 
 

A: She was a dressmaker, you really had, wh
at should I say, you didn™t have much in 
mi nd, the only thing you thought of was 
growing up and getting ma rried and 
having childr en, actually because that
™s what everybody did.  Here too in 
America, the same  way, nobody had any careers in their mi nd. 
 

Q: Lily would have been old enough to 
consider getting ma rried by this time – 
 

A: Well, kind of, kind of. 

 

Q: You, certainly not, you were much too young. 

 

Q: No, I was young.  Kind of, she was too young also, Lily.  The only body who 
mi ght have been was my brother, but he 
was in the army.  So he was the only one 
that was old enough. 
 

Q: How did people ma rry in your town, did th
ey get ma tched, or were they arranged? 
 

A: It was a match, they had a matchmaker
, it was ma tched.  And some  people got 
together  on their own, and those that didn™t, the families made the match. 
 
Q: Do you know how your parents ma rried? 

 

A: Ama tchalso. 

 

Q: But the fami lies knew each other. 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: She was from a different town, my mother. 

 

Q: She was born outside of Ruscova? 

 

A: Yes she was from a diffe rent town.  
So it had to be a ma tch.  There was no 
divorce, not one couple got divorced. 
 

Q: Now you mentioned that after a couple 
of years the Hungarians decided to reopen 
the schools because no one was going a
ny more  and you decided not to go. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: What did you decide to do? 
 
A: Stayed home and helped in the house. 

 

Q: You were still ma king dresses? 

 

A: My mother, yes.  I helped in the house, well, in the summertime there was a lot of 
work to do in the fields, in the spring 
and in the fa ll and in the whole summer.  
It™s a lot of labor. 
 

Q: Did any of your brothers a
nd sisters go to the schools? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So they did go? 

 

A: They all went, yes.  The younger ones, right. 

 

Q: Did they have any experien
ces good or bad in these schools? 
 

A: No, there was no, everything was kind of
 peaceful.  These Hungarian aristocrats, 
they were the teachers, their daughter-in- la
w, their daughter, the son-in-law, they 
were the teachers.  So they lived in 
the town, so everythi ng was, uh, peaceful. 
 
Q: So the ma in difference was that the la
nguage of instruction was Hungarian instead 
of Roma nia n? 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: What about the signs on the streets a
nd the notices and so forth, are they in 
Hungarian now? 
 

A: There were no signs on the streets, th
e only way you got news was with the drum. 
 

Q: So some one beat a drum? 

 

A: Some one would walk down the street, 
beating the drum, and as soon as a few 
people got around him he w
ould tell you the news. 
 

Q: The town crier? 

 

A: Well, whatever it was, whatever ne
ws it was, that™s how you heard the news. 
 

Q: That was your ma in source of ente
rtainment, someone hitting a drum?  
 

A: He hit a drum, then you gathered around him, and he would tell you what the 
news is, or what 
to do, or whatever. 
 

Q: Now when was the ghetto set up, do you reme mber how the ghetto came ? 

 

A: The ghetto wasn™t in our time, it wasn™t. 
 All I know is after 
Pesach they took us 
all together in the synagogue and then
 they shipped us out to ________ by the 
train and then we were there for a month. 
And then they told us we were going to 
a ma in ghetto, a ma in ghetto, and that wa
s Auschwitz and then we took like four 
days and four nights without water, wit
hout ba throom facilities, without anything, 
everyone sitting on top of each othe r, no room, everybody was scrunched 

together, there was no room to stand up eve
n, they put in so ma ny of us.  Day and 
night, day and night. 
 

Q: Now who told you had to move to _____________? 

 

A: Well the Hungarian soldiers. 

 

Q: The Hungarian soldiers came  in and said you had to go, how much notice did 
your fa mily get? 
 

A: They didn™t give you notice for anything. 
 

Q: It was today, you™re told, you go? 

 

A: Right, you do what you were to
ld, they didn™t give you notice. 
 

Q: The train was waiting for you? 

 

A: The train is waiting and you go. 

 

Q: Were you able to carry anything with you? 

 

A: Just what you carried. 

 

Q: So it was you, your mot her and father, and your–

ster.  And aunt and uncles and cousins, 
cousins, cousins.

A: The whole town, everybody.

A: They used the train and when we mo ved 
in we had an uncle living in _____ so we 
moved in with him.  And everybody got a

Q: What kind of train? 

 

A: Therailroad. 

 

Q: So it was regular passenger cars? 

 

A: Passengercars. 

 

Q: But no food, no water. 

 

A: In _________ it only took a few mi nutes, only half an hour or so. 

 

Q: And then how long were you in the ghetto? 

 

A: Four weeks, after Passover and before Shavuos.  By Shavuos we were in 
Auschwitz already. 
 

Q: And who controlled the ghetto? 
 

A: The Hungarians and then they put Jews 
in charge and they handled the Jews.  
They told the Jews that were in char
ge what they want and that™s how the 
messages came through. 
 

Q: Did you ever see any Germans?  

 

A: Not that I reme mber, I saw the 
Hungarians, the Hungarian police. 

 

Q: Thegreen? 

 

A: The Green Feathers.  They are scary. 

 

Q: Did they have any help, you me ntioned 
the Ukrainians and the Slovaks lived in 
the area, did any of these people help the Hungarians? 
 

A: Not at that time, no.  But when we left
 they destroyed, they took everything out of 
our houses, everything. 
 

Q: InRuscova? 

 

A: In Ruscova, because I came  back afte
r the war and everythi ng was gone, there 
wasn™t a stitch left in our house or anyone else™s house. 
 

Q: So you were staying with relatives in the ghetto? 
 
A: And my fa mily, my mot her, my father a
nd two little brothers a
nd little sister.  The 
three little kids. 
 

Q: What were those four weeks like? 

 

A: Nightma res. 

 

Q: In what way? 

 

A: There wasn™t enough food, there wasn
™t enough room, there wasn™t enough 
anything, sanitary conditions were terribl
e, so ma ny people in one little house. 
 

Q: No work, no income , no school? 

 

A: They were good at doing that, ma king the Jew into imbecile.  No work, no 
bathroom fa cilities so then 
you™re a filthy pig, of course. 
 

Q: Were you able to go out? 

 

A: In the ghetto, not 
outside the ghetto. 
 
Q: But within the ghetto you could walk the streets? 

 

A: Yes, what do kids know.  I was a kid,
 I ma de fun of everybody.  Kids are kids, 
they don™t take things seriously. 
 

Q: Did you have to wear a yellow star? 

 

A: That we wore even before the ghetto. 

 

Q: InRuscova? 

 

A: In Ruscova, that we wore before. 

 

Q: Do you remember when you ha
d to start wearing the star? 
 

A: That I don™t reme mber exactly.  Mayb
e like six months be
fore the ghetto. 
 

Q: Sixmonthsbefore? 

 

A: Maybe eight months, I™m not so sure
.  You know, you didn™t pay attention to 
anything because we always figured it™s 
only during the war and after the war it 
will all go back to normal. 
 

Q: So you had to sew your own?   Your mother sewed? 
 
A: She made a lot of them. 

 

Q: So your mot her ma de them for other people? 

 

A: For other people.  We  sold them.  We
 always kept on thinking that it™s only 
during the war.  The war will end and ev
erythi ng will go back to normal again. 
 

Q: So how did you and your fa mily find out
 you had to go to another ghetto?   An 
unnamed ghetto? 
 

A: Thepoliceagain. 

 

Q: They ma de t he announcement?  

 

A: They ma de t he announcement that we were going to the other ghetto, the ma in 
ghetto, in Czechoslovakia. 
 

Q: In Czechoslovakia, they said.  And how
 much time did you have to get ready for 
this trip? 

 
A: No time at all.  No time at all.  Ri
ght away.  They didn™t let you know in advance 
anything.  If we would have run away ma
ybe.  Maybe some  of us would have run 

away.  Can you imagine.  I can™t believe th
at people were so ignorant to believe 
all those lies. 
 

Q: You mean about this ma in ghetto in Czechoslovakia? 

 

A: The ghetto and ________ and not run away.  No fa mily hid.  Not one fa mily from 
our town hid. 
 

Q: Either in Ruscova or? 

 

A: In some  other towns they hid.  Some  fa milies survived.  All you had to do was 
hold out for three months, six months at
 the most.  Like I™m telling you my 
brother got liberated six mont
hs later after he left.  All you had to do was hid out 
for a few we eks, then the Hungarians left or some thing. 
 

Q: What™s a little girl to know? 

 

A: I mean, there were the politicians.  

 

Q: The council the Jewish council? 

 

A: The Jewish council.  They should 
have known.  They were saying, ﬁFollow 
instructionsﬂ.  Now I guarantee those H
ungarian aristocrats knew what was going 
on.  But they didn™t tell anybody because they
 we re friends with
 all the Hungarian 
officers and I™m sure the o
fficers knew what was going on. 
 

Q: So suddenly you are ordered to report 
to the train stati
on for another trip? 
 

A: Yes.  They stacked us in again, lock
ed the doors and that was it.  And unlocked 
them and Auschwitz. 
 

Q: Now this time , was it a passenger train?  

 

A: No, a cattle train. 

 

Q: But you didn™t know that 
until you got on the train?  
 

A: When we got on the trai n.  But that 
wa s cattle train.  It was nightma re.  Plain, 
plain nightmare.  Then when we arrived 
and we finally thought we were arriving 
someplace, like I was going to help my mother
 with the little sister to take her out 
of the train, and one of the workers, th
e Jewish workers, pushed me  awa y.  I 

understand they did it to a lot of people.  
They saved a lot of young girls.  Because 
if you had a child in your hands, you went 
to the crematorium immediately; if you 

were a certain age an a certain time  and a certain body, they sent you to work so I 
guess those Jewish workers unloading the 
people from those trains, they knew 
what™s what so as I was going to help 
with the child, he pushed me  away and he 
says I should go away.  I didn™t know, so I 
listened and that ™s the last I saw of the 
fa mily. 
 

Q: Your younger sister
 and your parents? 
 

A: My whole family and my  parents,
 that ™s the last I saw of them. 
 

Q: And you we re alone after this? 

 

A: Yes.  Everything is rush, rush, rush. 
 They take you away and I thought I™d see 
them.  They told you you™d meet the parent
s at night.  So then they took us to a 
different place, they showered us and 
they cut off our hair and took away our 
clothes and gave us the camp clothes.  Th
e striped uniforms, wh
atever.  No hair.  

Nobody recognized any body  Everybody thought
, ﬁI don™t look like that, I don™t 
look like thatﬂ.  You didn™t have a mirro
r, you didn™t see yourself.  Until one day, 
I saw myself in a window.  The kitchen had windows.  Our barracks didn™t have 

windows. 
 

Q: Now, when you got on the train, your fa mily was together? 

 

A: We were all together . 

 

Q: And a lot of the people that were on the train, you knew them?  
 
A: Everybody, we knew everybody. 

 

Q: Now, the trip you say took bout four days? 

 

A: Four days and four nights. 

 

Q: What did people do, what did th
ey say, what did they think? 
 

A: They cried and cried and cried and crie
d and cried and cried ----- the kids cried, 
the people cried, we all cried.  We  didn™t 
have a bathroom fa cilities, we didn™t 
have water.  The little children were 
thirsty, we gave them urine to drink. 
 

Q: Nobody fed you during the trip, no water to drink? 

 

A: Just what you took with you.  We  didn™t 
know what to take or how long it would 
take or anything like that.  We  di
dn™t take water, we didn™t know. 
 

Q: You didn™t know where you were going? 

 

A: It rained one day so we stuck a cup 
through the wire window, we stuck out a cup 
to catch a little rain.  It wa
s a horrible, horrible experience. 
 
Q: And when you arrive it is even worse. 

 

Q: When you arrive, it™s even worse. They
 rush, rush, rush, rush, here, there.  
Mengele did the picking. 
 

Q: Was it daylight when you arrived? 

 

A: Daylight.  He  did the picking.  As I say, 
I didn™t have a child so I went that way.  I 
didn™t know anything. 
 

Q: Were there any friends w
ith you after the selection? 
 

A: Yes, my cousins, my friends.  
We  stayed together the whole time. 
 

Q: What were you forced to do? 

 

A: Well, we got into the saylager in 
Auschwitz and we chopped down stones, broke 
up stones and carried them to a certain spot.  Then we had to, every morning the 

saylafeller, I don™t if you h
eard about that, the saylafe
ller, we fainted away, me  
too, we all fa inted away, cause we stood 
there for hours in the same  spot.  And 

that went on for six months, from M a y to October 
 

Q: This was the first time  you™d seen Ge rmans, in Auschwitz? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Now, you were ther e until the fall of 1944. 

 

A: And you know what they did?   On Yom Kippur , they came to see if we were 
eating.  They didn™t want us to fast.  So so
me  girls didn™t fast. I fasted.  Some  girls 
didn™t fast so they were eating and they 
were satisfied to see some  girls eat. 
 

Q: What was the norma l food when you weren™t fasting? 

 

A: Well, you got a slice of bread, that saw
dust bread that™s what we called it.  Soup 
and a piece of liverwurst for dinner and that was it. 
 

Q: So a norma l day was almost a fast? 

 

A: Oh yes.  Wh at was it, 600 calories.
  How long could you survive on 600 calories, 
like six months or so and then you should die. 
 

Q: And that™s about how long you were there. 

 
A: And that™s how long I was there. 

 

Q: Performi ng hard labor for those months. 

 

A: Definitely, definitely.  And no 
clothes and no nothing. So, all that. 
 

Q: And you knew what was going on in the rest of the camp? 

 

A: Let™s say we saw the smoke from the cr
ematorium.  Next door to us there was a 
gypsy camp also.  And one morning we woke 
up and they weren™t there.  So they 
took care of them very quickly.  We  didn™ t see any of the crematorium, we only 

saw smoke. 
 

Q: Did you know they were gas chambers? 

 

A: We knew, and we knew and as I say I c
ouldn™t believe it.  I 
couldn™t absorb what 
was going on.  I couldn™t believe it.  I couldn™
t understand it.  I c
ouldn™t believe it.  
I just didn™t believe that this could be 
going on.  I always said
 we going to meet 
my fa mily when this war is over.  They were in a separate working camp and I™ll 

meet the family.  Until I went into the working camp, the labor camp, and then I 

began to realize I think, they gave us that
 stuff in Auschwitz that we shouldn™t get 

our period..  I think that made me ve ry bl
urred because I remember not being very 

clearly thinking.  Could be that st
uff ma de me  not alert at all. 
 

Q: You were like in a daze while you were in Auschwitz? 
 
A: I reme mber always thinking not being able
 to think too clearly.  So it possibly was 
t h at  st uff. 
 

Q: Did you see any people getti
ng killed with your own eyes? 
 

A I was very fortunate.  I didn™t see anything like that.  I saw once a lady went on 
the barbed wire.  She didn™t want to liv
e any more so she threw herself on the 
electric wire and she died.  The only th
ing I knew, we had a hospital in Saylag, 
the only thing I knew nobody s
hould go to the hospital. 
 

Q: And why wa s that? 

 

A: Because then if they would go to the hos
pital, we would never see them again.  So 
I happened to have been, as you say I ate 
very good and I was a healthy child and 
I was able to –. And in our area we were
n™t spoiled people.  We were used to 

working hard.  And we weren™t used to sl
eeping on a soft bed because we  had the 
wooded boards and a straw ma ttress and r
ough sheets.  We  didn™t have the fine 
linens like the city people had.  And thi
ngs like that.  So 
we were able to 

withstand all that  hardships better than 
city people.  That™s why a lot of us 
survived. 
 
Q: From your t own? 

 

A: From my town.  I would say, and I™m sure 
fr om a lot of other little towns.  But if 
you were from any kind of softer upbri
nging you couldn™t survive.  Today, I 
couldn™t survive that.  My children coul
d never survive because you would just go 
on that wire and kill yourself because it w
ouldn™t pay to live.  You have to give up 

all that.  But we were very roughened up. 
 

Q: O.K., we we re talking about 
what it was like as a survivor. 
 

A: As I was saying, city people could never 
survive.  And they di
dn™t.  They fell like 
flies.  They couldn™t hand
le that bad situation. 
 

Q: What else in your opinion, were import
ant factors in surviv
al in a place like 
Auschwitz? 
 

A: Well, the thing was this.  We were 
together.  When they say mi sery wants 
company, that™s the truth.  We  were a
ll in the same  situation.  Nobody was any 
different.  We were all 
kind of young and there wasn™t ma ture person who was 
ma rried and had children because once you had children, you went straight  with 

your children. And we kind of stuck togeth
er the whole time.  So that you didn™t 
feel alone. You had your fa mily, people th
at you grew up with, with you.  Your 
fa mily, your friends, everybody.  And then we slept like herrings, you know like a 
can of herrings, this way and that way, 
that™s how we slept, seven this way and 
seven that way and one blanket.  And 
you couldn™t turn around.  And that™s how 
you had to sleep, the way you lay down, that‚s how you had to sleep on the same  

side.  And the one that was at the end,
 was never covered.  That was Auschwitz. 
 

Q: Now, when some  people describe Au
schwitz, they describe what you just 
described.  They cooperated and helped one
 another.  Others, some ti me s depicted 
Auschwitz where everyone is trying to su
rvive and where even 
a little bit of food 
is some thing you fight for.  Did you see any of that? 
 

A: I saw some  of that, yes, not amongst 
us.  Not amongst our friends.  I saw some  
people were able to go into 
the kitchen, they went into
 the kitchen and they did 
get something extra and like you say, they would kill you for it. 
 

Q: Now you we re with women all the 
time, you were separated fr om me n?  

 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: It would be interesting to do a comp
a r ative study of how women behaved with 
each other and how me n behaved. 

 
Q: Our barrack, I tell you -- there was neve
r any incidents in 
our barrack.  They 
came, they brought a pot of hot water, wh
atever it was.  They gave you in a bowl 
a little scoop full, a ladle 
of hot water and you took it and you ate it and the bread 
and the kopel that we had happened to be 
a nice woman.  And th
anks to her, we 
went into the best labor cam
p when we went to work in the working camp when 
they sent us. 
 

Q: When you were transferred from Aus c hwitz? 

 

A: When we were transferred from Aus c hwitz
.  I think it was thanks to her; she was 
a nice intelligent woman.  It must have 
been hard that she kept us in line, 
whatever. 
 

Q: Was she Hungarian? 

 

A: Czechoslovakian. 

 

Q: So some one you never, nobody knew before? 

 

A: You see, all the people in charge were
 Polish or  Czechoslovakian because  they 
were ther e years before us.  Like they said, they built the camp for us.  They had it 

very, very rough.  We  got there, they said this is a vacation for you.  Because we 

had to build it all.  They went thr
ough terrible hell, they went through. 
 

Q: You guys had a higher number than they did. 
 
A: But I didn™t even get the number becaus
e we were not even considered people any 
more.  Those that got a number were cons
idered at least a worker.  We  were not 
even considered that.  Because we were not gi ven a number.  We just had a 

number sewn on a piece of paper on our uni
form.  Most of the Hungarian Jews 

don™t have numbers.  Only those that went
 in 1942.  Like I was telling you they 
took them whose parents weren™t ma rried a
nd then ma ybe those that went at the 

beginning but otherwise once we came , itwas already they didn™t want us any 

more 
 

Q: Also when you arrived, there were
 such large numbers, ma ss ive. 
 

A: Day after day, day and night. 

 

Q: How did you get transferred, now, you sa
id you think your kapo played a role in 
your transfer? 
 

A: Well, they came , in Aus c hwitz you mean to go to work, they came, I have to 
mention one more thing before I get to 
that.  One day they came  and took blood 
from everybody for the soldiers. I held out, 
I didn™t want to give blood.  And the 

people that they caught to give blood, they
 said they were never the same  again 
because they didn™t ha ve  food to ma ke up for the loss of blood. 
 
Q: So you ma naged to avoid? 

 

A: I ma naged to avoid.  I had one motto 
-- I run to nothing a
nd I don™t hide from 
nothing.  Whatever God will give  me, that
™s what I™ll take. I had that motto.  
That™s one thing I ran wa y from, giving blood. 
 

Q: How did you ma nage to do that? 

 

A: I went to another barrack when they 
took our barrack.  They only took the people 
in the barracks. 
 

Q: You were the only one in your barrack that did that? 

 

A: I don™t know if others did it but I 
did it and I™m very glad I did it. 
 

Q: Because you needed every drop of blood? 

 

A: You needed every drop of blood but thos
e poor people, the kids said they were 
never the same  again since that
 blood, they were so weak. 
 

Q: Do you remember whether this was s
oon after you arrived or much later? 
 

A: Much later, much later.  Shortly befo
re they took us away to the working camp.  
So anyway, the kapo said they were going 
to come  and select us, they needed 250 
girls for the working camp and they took 
you to a different area, different camp, a 
different area and again 
they showered us, oh God, again, naked and disinfect 
you.  A ma n had to disinfect you, prisoners
, and we were shy, so shy and so 
ashame d for  the ma n to disinfect you, with the hose, you know. 
 

Q: Do you remember when this was? 

 

A: When we got to Auschwitz and when 
we went to the working camp, again this 
was. 
 

Q: No, I mean, do you reme mber when this 
was, when they were getting ready to 
move you to the working camp?  
 

A: That was in October, October of ™44.  
Then they showered us and disinfect us and 
gave us different clot
hes and they had us sitting in 
a room on concrete stairs.  So 
that™s where we spent the night, on these 
concrete stairs.  And they came and took 
two girls out and they sent two nurse
s along, so we knew it was going to be a 
good camp.  And then they sent us to 
the camp which was in Weisswasser and 

they had the barracks when we got ther
e, I don™t know how long it took to get 
there. 
 

Q: How did you get there? 

 

A: By train.  From Auschwi t z. 

 

Q: Weisswasser.  This 
is in Czechoslovakia? 

 

A: Czechoslovakia, yes.  Sudatin. 

 

Q: That was the German name  for this pl ace? 

 

A: Yes.  There is Rodwasser also, you know
, there is red water after the camp, I saw 
it. It™s red water too.  So 
when we got liberated and we
 took a walk to the next 
town, there was Rodwasser and th
ere was red water.  Anyway. 
 

Q: Were you transferred in a cattle car again? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber that time . 
It could have been a truck. 
 

Q: The disinfecting and all that occu
rred after you arrived in We i sswasser? 
 

A: No before, everything was in Auschwitz. 
 In We isswasser, we were treated like 
people.  You got your own bed, your
 own sheet, your own blanket. 
 
Q: So no cattle car this time ? 
 

A: No cattle car.  Everything, they c
ouldn™t, the We hrma cht, that™s the __________, 
and the Wehrmacht ran the camp, ran the factory.  They ran the camp.  Actually, 

the Nazis ran the camp. But one day one of
 the SS wome n be at up a girl for some  
reason and the next da
y she wasn™t there. 
 

Q: The SS wo ma n wasn™t there? 

 

A: Wasn™t there.  And there we had mo re food, another clothing,
 another change of 
clothing, they gave us. 
 

Q: Did you get warmer clothing? 

 

A: In the winter, we got warmer clothing 
for the winter, yes and a different pair of 
shoes already.  There they treated us 
more like huma n beings.  It was an 
ammunition factory.  You ma de radios for 
the planes and the ships, we made.  
And there we were until May 9
th
.  It got slow after a whil
e and we got scared they 
were going to send us some place else  but we
 were very, very fortunate they didn™t 
send us away.  And the Russians came  in a
nd the head of the camp even held us a 

speech and said we should all leave the 
camp and go to the next town is the 
Czechs and they™ll take us in.  Because  th
e Russian soldiers will arrive  and here 
there are so many wome n, they™ll come and ra
pe us and that™s what I did, most of 
us went away and the ones that rema
ined, they did get raped by the Russian 
soldiers.  I di d stay with a Czech family
 for three weeks and then I ma de my way 
home  which took four weeks.  On top of 
railroads.  It didn™t
 cost you any money 
because there was chaos.  How I ever got back, I™ll never understand. 
 

Q: Because you™d never be en away from home? 

 

A: I™d never been away from home , I™d neve
r traveled on trains and how to get back 
from there to Ruscova, I don™t know how I 
ever ma de it. But I got back, it took 
like four weeks.  And in between I stopped off to see my sister in Budapest.  She 

remained there because she had her pe
ople, she already was getting ma rried. 
 

Q: So she did find a husband in Budapest? 

 

A: Yes, and I came  home  a nd I found my brother there. 

 

Q: The one who had been liberated by the Russians? 

 

A: Liberated by the Russians.  And a lo
t of other people came home and we were 
there until October. And in October al
ready, a lot of people started to leave 
Ruscova to go back to Germany either to go 
to Israel or to America. So, again, it 
took four weeks but at time  already we ha
d a lot of help.  There were a lot of 
organizations already working and helping 
us.  They had already set up places in 
Budapest where we should stay and then
 they smuggled us across the border to 
Austria.  We  went to Austria.  From
 Austria to Germany. But  there already you 
had lots of organizations helping you.  And then I wound up in a DP ca mp and 
_________ in Germany i n the American zone.  That™s because we had an aunt 

here and we knew ---five of us came , my 
cousin Dave, my cousin  Nathan, my 
cousin Ceil and my cous in Ruchel and 
me  and we all ma de it to Germany on the 
American zone.  And we were there 
‚till --- I came in February 18 1947. 
 

Q: Were you in a DP ca mp? 

 

A: I was in a DP camp.  They treated us very good in the DP camp.  We  had 
everything.  They threw out the Germans of
 apartments and they gave us their 

houses so we had a house and piano and they
 had kitchens for us.  Or either you 
could go and eat in the soup kitchen or 
you could cook yourselves.  They gave us 
packages of food from the joint and then 
the joint took us out here.  And I came  
here on a Tuesday and Monday I went to 
work as a finisher.  I had no trade. 
 

Q: You didn™t want to be a dressmaker again? 

 

A: Yeh.  So I went to work as a finisher. 
 And I worked until I became pregnant and I 
got ma rried two years later. 
 
Q: You got ma rried first and then you became pregnant? 

 

A: Yes.  I got married and then I became pregnant.  I worked until I became 
pregnant. 
 

Q: It came out the wrong way. 

 

A: In those days you didn™t do those things.  No, you first got ma rried.  I me t my 
husband.  His mother is from my home  to
wn, fr om Ruscova.  So, I me t him.  And 
when I met him, we couldn™t even talk
 two words because he doesn™t speak 
Yiddish and I didn™t speak English.  I was he
re six weeks.  So then we didn™t see 
each other for a year and we me t a year later and we started to date.  And we got 

engaged six months later and six mo nths 
later we got ma rried which was June 4
th
 
1949 and our first daughter was born Nove mber 15 1950.  So, I worked and I™m 

still working. 
 

Q: And the fa mily grows. 

 

A: God bless them.  Should only keep 
growing.  So now I have two wonderful 
daughters and a wonderful husband.  He
™s a very nice ma n.  And five 
grandchildren. 
 

Q: When did you realize that
 you lost your parents? 
 

A: In the working camp.  By then, we knew already more what™s going on. 

 

Q: In the working camp of Czechoslovakia? 

 

A: And then we had, we were only 250 girl
s and after a while they brought another 
250 girls from another camp plus they 
brought a doctor to camp and they said 
what™s going on.  And they told us all 
the things what™s happening and what™s 
going on.  So then we began to realize but
 I st ill di dn™t believe until I got ho me 
after the war and nobody came home . 
 

Q: When you went back to Ruscova? 

 

A: When I went back to Ruscova.  I was su
re the family was going to come home.  
And I understand my fat her lived until Purim.  That™s when he died. 
 

Q: InAuschwitz? 

 

A: No, in a labor camp. 

 

Q: So he was put in a labor camp?  
 

A: He was put in a labor camp, my fathe3
r™cause I know people that was with him.  
And then he got killed in the cremat
orium one of the crematoriums, possibly 
Buchenwald. 
 

Q: So when you arrived in Auschwitz, you we
re separated from your fa mi ly and your 
father was also separated. 
 

A: After they went together and after th
ey separated the me n from the wome n, the 
children went with the mothers and that was it. 
 

Q: So your father was put into slave labor in Auschwitz and then transferred to a 
labor camp and then probably to Buchenwald until Purim. the following year.  
 

A: Which was another month, till May 9
th
, when the Russians came  in and we got 
liberated.  If he could only have survived. 
 

Q: He died about a month before? 

 

A: About a mo nth before, ‚cause that™s wh
at a ma n who was with him told me , that 
till then he was alive. 
 

Q: In Buchenwald.  In fact, the ma n I in
terviewed this morning was in Buchenwald. 
 

A: The me n, they went through horrors, the me n.  They were worse to the men then 
to the wome n, those Nazis.  And they 
were worse to the Polish, then the 
Hungarians.  They were pretty bad to 
everybody, they were pretty bad.  Just no 
reason for it.  I still can™t
 understand it.  How it happened, how the world allowed 
it.  It  makes no sense to me until today™s date. 
 

Q: So although you were in a daze in Auschwitz, even when you came out of the 
daze, it still doesn™t make sense to you? 
 

A: And it still doesn™t.  Does it ma ke sense to you? 

 

A: Notreally. 

 

A: No, it doesn™t.  I can™t u
nderstand it.  It wasn™t on
e person who did it, Hitler. 
 

Q: Couldn™t have done it by himself. 

 

A: He had to have, there was a lot of help,or Mengele.  It™s unbelievable. It™s such a 
-- if I really think about it, I coul d just 
kill myself, because it™s unbelieva ble, such 
a horrors. 
 

Q: For you, though, you didn™t know anything about Hitler.  It be gan with the 
Hungarians. Without the Hungarians, it w
ouldn™t have happened the way it did. 
 
A: No, because I have my uncle, Mendel 
Hyam, he was in Romania and he survived 
with his fa milies, three boys
 and his wife.  My cousin
 Hycha was in Romania.  
She survived with her three boys and he
r husband.  My cousin Shay was in 
Roma nia and she survived also with her 
four children and her husband.  They had 
it very bad.  They went through such hells.  
But they survived with their fa milies.  
The Romanians didn™t give out thei r fa milies.  They imprisoned them themselves.  

They made camps for them themselves 
but they didn™t give them out to the 
Germans.  The Hungarians gave them out imme diately. 
 

Q: In your particular town, it
 was a particular family, this aristocratic family which 
you described earlier. 
 

A: Well, they were Hungarians and they c
ould have saved us.  If they had any kind 
of heart, they could have saved at least so
me  of us.  They were in business with a 
lot of the Jewish people and th
ey let those people also go. 
 

Q: Now you said you played with th
eir children, right up to the end. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: You never suspected that
 they hated you so much? 
 

A: No.  They were friends with everybody. 
 We had to cater to them a little more 
when the Hungarians came  in and everybody wa
s afraid of them and they tried to 
please them and all of that but we never 
believed they could be like that.  One 
good satisfaction, at least they
 are not living in that ma
nsion and that mansion is 
completely destroyed.  When I went b
ack a few years ago, it wasn™t there. 
 

Q: But it was there when you re
turned in the fall of 1945? 
 

A: When I returned, it was there.  When 
I went back in ™84, I had to go back once 
more and see; I went to the cemetery, 
I went to the synagogue.  We  had two 
synagogues so one synagogue is dest royed al
ready and one is falling apart.  By 
now, it is probably destroyed too.  There 
was three Jews left and I understand one 
of them moved to Israel sin
ce then so there™s only two Jews
 left in all of Ruscova.  
The cemetery is beautiful -- it
™s still there and they have
, I guess, they hire -- the 
Joint has a caretaker taking car
e of it, which is very nice.
  I guess they must be 
doing it all over Europe to take care of
 the cemeteries that they shouldn™t get 

destroyed. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that your sister in B
udapest ma rried.  Did she also come  to 
America? 
 

A: She stayed -- my sister rema ined 
in Budapest until 1965.  In 1965, I took her out 
here and then her husband died, and then
 her two daughters came  here.  First one 
daughter she took out and then another 
daughter.  She has two grandchildren.  
And they are all here now, thank God. 
 
Q: And your brother also came  to America? 

 

A: My brother came to Americ
a in 1949 and at that time, they didn™t let hi m settle 
here any more, so they sent him to Califor
nia.  So he had three children and he 
passed away in 1963 and my sister-in-la
w just passed away in 1989.  And the 
three children are there -- he has th
ree very beautiful children and three 
grandchildren but he is not here to enjoy them. 
 

Q: Do you have any additional observations
 or thoughts about your experiences and 
your fa mily™s? 
 

A: My fa mily that is dead?   
All I can tell you is -- but I 
told you I was the baby sitter 
most of the time  -- my two little brot hers 
and little sist er .  But I remember fr om 

them.  Whenever I used to
 sit down they used to hang on to me  and kiss me  and 
hug me  and that is what I reme mber most 
about them.  How t hey used to kiss and 
hug me . They really loved me . 
(survivor starts to cry) 
 

Q: And you we ren™t even able to say goodbye to them?  

 

A: No.  One day in the concentration camp, 
someone told me that they saw my older 
brother Burachal?? , he was twelve years 
old.  He™s alive (they said).  I went 
looking in that camp every day to see 
him.  And you know what?   The whole 
time, I saved up four portions of bread to
 give him and I never saw him.  So I 

don™t know if they said the truth or not.  
And another thing I have to say -- when 
we went to the working camp, I had this 
very good friend of mi ne from my home  
town -- Rochela.  And they chose us na
ked to go to the working camp.  So she 
was very skinny and she was right behind 
me and I went forward -- they let -- 
they pointed me  to go forward, I went 
forward and I am there and I am looking 
for my friend Rochela and she is not there. 
 I give a look to the other side and she 
is over there -- purple and blue and that is 
the last that I saw of her.  You see, you 
had to be perfect to survive.  You c
ouldn™t have a pimple on your body and here 
they gave you for six mo nths not to get 
your period and we broke out in all kinds 
of boils and as a ma tter of fact, ,I di
d have a boil on my belly but the SS me n 
didn™t see me, he must have been distract
ed so he didn™t see the boil, he just 
pointed me  to go ahead.  But we all had so
mething fr om that --  it wasn™t normal 
and that is the last I saw Rochela. So 
they chose you naked -- you couldn™t be too 
skinny, you couldn™t be too fat.  You coul
dn™t have a boil, you couldn™t –– can 

you imagine? 
 

Q: You couldn™t be sick? 

 

A: You couldn™t be sick.  Can you imagin
e how ma ny people survived really?   How 
few survived? 
 
Q: Veryfew.  

 

A: I mean just to think of it.  If you ha
d a child you went right away.  If you were 
old, you went right away.  So there wasonly a certain few that were old enough -- 

if you were young. I me an the youngest pe
ople that could live is two years 
younger than I am.  The r e is three girls fr
om my hometown and then there™s me.  
Because I wa s sixteen.  So you had to be 
a certain age and a certain weight and a 

certain shape -- too fat and they wouldn™
t -- you went right away if you were too 
fat.  And then finally when you ma de  
it and after six months in Auschwitz you 
had to be -- you couldn™t be too skin
ny, you couldn™t have any pimples on you -- 
you know?   It™s unbelievable. 
 

Q: But you survived. 

 

A: I was husky. 

 

Q: And you didn™t come  down with any di
seases?   You didn™t me ntion typhus, for 
example. 
 

A: No, no. I never was sick a day.  I wa
s husky and I had a very, very nourishing 
upbringing.  Everything was very natural a
nd very healthy and that is how we 
should eat today.  All that
 good, healthy natural food. 
 
Q: I will say yes to that . 
 

A: Yes. So I had good stock -- as my son-in-law says ﬁpeasant stock.ﬂ 

 

Q: Peasant stock -- good genes -- good upbringing. 

 

A: So all those little things that I guess 
God was with me .  I put myself in God™s 
hands.  As I told you a while ago -- I ma
de up my mi nd, I am 
not going to run to 
and I am not going to run away.  Wh ere G
od will put me , that is where I am going 
to go.  And that is what I did.  I didn™t 
run to and I didn™t run from.  Like they 
used to say, they™re picking from this bl
ock or that block a
nd they ran to that 
block to be picked or ran away from our 
block so that they shouldn™t be picked. I 
let God™s hands and then I never believed 
– Oh -- this you must hear too.  In the 
labor camp, I have -- I happened to have 
a mechanical mi nd.  So they put me  to 
work -- to do a ma n™s machine -- work a 
man™s machine.  So because I understand 
machinery. 
 

Q: This is when you were working on these radio controls? 

 

A: Right, yes. So, some  of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and 
some of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the 
hallway and flirt with them 
and I wouldn™t.  I said like 
this -- if I™m going to burn 
-- there will be less of me to burn.  If they
 give you a slice of
 bread, an apple -- I 
don™t need that.  If I™m going to burn, ther
e will be less of me  to burn.  If I am 
going to survive then I have a conscience I 
want to live with my conscience -- that 
is not to sell my soul for a piece of bread
 or for a piece of appl e.  And I didn™t get 
anything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the ma il back and forth.  

That is another thing -- I am very proud 
of myself that I was young and yet I had 
my principles. 
 

Q: You had your honor and your dignity. 

 

A: My honor and my dignity.  First I didn™
t believe that they™re going to let me  
survive.  Would you believe they™re going 
to let you survive and tell the world 
what happened?   I never believed.  The 
only thing I hoped was for the bombs to 

come .  So then I said, if they put me  in
 the crematorium, I will burn quicker if 
there is less fat on me.  So that is my morals. 
 

Q: So there was flirting between ma les and – 

 

A: Males and females.  Oh, we had a French
 labor force.  That is where the flirting 
went on -- they were free. 
 

Q: These were French P.O.W.™s? 

 
A: I forget what they are called. 
 

Q: They were me n though? 

 

A: They were me n.  They were
 forced laborers but they live
d free, they didn™t live in 
camps. 
 

Q: But they worked in the same  ca mp a s you? 

 

A: They worked in the sa me -- they worked 
in the same factories.  So, they met in 
the hallways and they flirted with each 
other.  I was too young for that anyway.  
For flirting, or for anything like that.  Bu
t I didn™t get anything from the m but I 
did deliver the me ssages.  
That was some thing huh? 
 

Q: Do you remember anything else? 

 

A: There were probably a lo
t of incident s -- there is 
probably a whole year of 
incidents that you can™t just 
-- you know -- think of them. 
 

Q: You reme mbered quite a bit today. 

 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: On that note, I thank you. 

 

A: I thank you Tony.  You are a very nice ma n. 

 

Q: You are welcome.  Y
ou are a very nice lady. 
 

A: Your mother did a good job.  Thank her for me. 

 

Q: Iwill. 

 

A: Bye. 

 

Q: Bye.
