T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hat you are about to hear

W ebegin with this portrait of  Alf red Munzer dressed in a Jewish National Fund costum ef orthe 
Purim  holiday, takenafter the war, probably 1948.  Al was born in Novem ber, 1941 inTheHague, 
Netherlands. Al's parents, Sim cha and Giselle, were m arried in 1932 in T he Hague.  Herewe see 
their wedding portrait.  Al had two older sisters, Eva and Leana. Eva is on the lef t, Leana is on the 
right, with Al between them.  
 
 
T he Germ an Arm y invaded the Netherlands in May 1940 beforeAlwas born.  Immediately, lif e 
becam e very diff icult for Dutch Jews.  Af ter the invasion,
 
the Munzers rem ained in their hom eand 
endured the repressive m easurestaken against Jews.  On this mapwe see the Germ an invasion 

routesof W estern Europe in 1940.  
 
 
In 1942 Al's sisters went into hiding with thefriend of aneighbor. Al went intohiding with the 
ex
-
husband of a neighbor, an Indonesian imm igrant namedT ole Madna.  Here we see aphoto of 
T ole Madna.  
 

 
Al spent the rest of the war in T ole Madna's house, where he was caredf orby T ole's 
Indonesian nanny, Mim a Saina.  T his photo was taken 
while Al was in hiding in Tole's hom e.  Mim a 
Saina ispictured on the lef t, andT ole Madnais in the m iddleholding Al.  
 
 
Al came to the UnitedStates with his motherin 1958. He obtainedhis undergraduate degree

My parents were born in Eastern Europe inapart of the world which  at that time was part of  
the Austro

HungarianEm pire.  My f ather in a sm all town called Kanczuga, m y m other in Rym anow.  
Conditions in those towns, for Jews, were fairl y good, until the endof  the FirstW orldW ar.  At that 
tim e,those littletowns becam epartof  Poland and things becam emore difficultf or Jews.  More 
persecutions,pogrom s, so there was a lot ofpressurefor Jews to leave those little towns.  Andm y

My m other lef t herhom etown, Rym anow, for Berlin, which was thebig center thatattracted a

lot of  Jews after the FirstW orldW ar. T here she joined two older siblings, and who hadalready 
establisheda business there.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy did your m other go to Berlin, as things were so diff icult in Berlin in1930s? 
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, she arrived there really bef ore the rise of the Nazis.  She arrived in Berlin 
actually just before Hitler's book " MeinKam pf," m y struggle.  She had no concern about Nazis, so the 
attraction was m oving to the big city, being liberated f rom  them entality of  living in a sm all town.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  A very cosmopolitan center.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Actually, the most cosmopolitan at the tim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said yourf ather opened a clothing business. You had written in amem oir that
 
" all of m y ancestors were tailors."   
 
>> Al Munzer:  T ailoring seem s to have beenpart of m yf am ily's story f or many, many generations.  
T here's afam ous story abouta Jewish sage in m y mother's hom etown, in Rym anow, who m ade the 
aphorism , which really showed his background asa tailor. He said,Alwa ys m end what isold, and 
never spoil what is new.  And that sort of becam e his very f am ous saying.  It reflected thefact that,as 
a young m an,hehad been apprenticed to atailor.  
 
 
T hese little towns of ten are really caricatured in plays like " Fiddler on the Roof"  but inactual 
fact, some very im portant people who contributed greatly to science and medicine cam ef rom those 

little towns. T wo of  the people who cam ef rom m y parents'hom etown were a m an nam ed I

for thef irst tim e to the United States. So some people very im portant in science andm edicine 
com ingf rom  these tiny towns.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Including descendents off olks, like yourself.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Exactly.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You also wrote your grandparents keptfew of theirpossessions in cash,furn
iture or 

homes. W hy was that?

Hungarian Em pire, 
when Jews were som ewhat protected,therewas al ways the fear ofpogrom s,of persecution, andof  
thepossibility that they would have to leave their hom es ina hurry.  T hat's why they really did not 
invest in things like real estate, but really kept their possessions in things that were tangible and that 
they could carry with them , like jewelr y.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  If and when they
 
needed it.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  In case they had to leave in ahurry.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other leaves Berlin, goes to Holland,m eetsyour f ather, they marry. W hat 
was Holland likef or Jews at that tim e?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, Jews had lived in Hollandf or hundredsof  years, and Jews were f ully integrated 

andaccepted in Dutchsociety.  Butm y parents, m y m otherarrived in Holland, interestingly enough, 
andm arried m yf athervirtually on the same day that Adolf  Hitler was administered the oathof  off ice 
m aking him  chancellor of Germ any, sort of  starting really the Nazi er a in neighboring Germany, just a 
few hundred m iles away.  But that's whenm y parents were m arried in Holland.  
 
 
Fortunately, theyf elt very saf eat thetime. They becam e very close f riends with their

Jewish, with theirChristian neighbors, and really enjoyed being awa y from the constraints of 
living in a ver y restricted atm osphere in Eastern Europe.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents wouldhave three children, and you were the youngest.
  
W hen were 
your sisters born,Eva andLeana?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  My sist er Eva, the oldest, was born July 1936.  And this was obviously a m ajor 
celebration,a majormomentof  joyf orm y parents. Interestingly enough, it is also the exact same 
tim e that the infamous Berlin Olym pics were held, which Adolf  Hitler turned intoan instrum ent of Nazi 
propaganda.  So again, the juxtaposition of the very happy event wit h som ething of  the rise of  Nazis 
in neighboring Germ any.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile your parentsare living,  in their m inds, the good life at that tim e.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Exactly.  Even at that tim e, itwas ver y diff icult, if  not im possible really,f orm y m other's 

relatives, m y father's relatives who li ved in Berlin to gainanexit visa to come visit m y pa
rents and be 
part of the celebration.  
 
 
My sister Lea was born 1938, Novem ber 12,1938.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Another very auspiciousday.  
 

>> Al Munzer:  Exactly.  Novem ber 9
-
10, 1938 was thenight when thefullf ury of anti

S e m it i sm  wa s  
unleashed in Germ any. T hat's when hundreds of  synagogues were destroyed andthousands of  

Jewish businesses were plundered andm any Jews were sent to concentration cam ps, another major 
turning point in thepersecution of Jews under the Nazi era.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwe refer to asthe Night of  Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht.  War began 

September 1, 1939, whenGermany invadedPoland starting the war. T hef ollowing May, May 1940,

Holland as well as Belgium  and Luxem bourg, the so
-
called low countries, were attacked by Germa
n y.   
T ell us what you can about what thatm eantfor your fam ily andother Jews in Holland, both 
im mediately af ter the Nazi occupation and in them onths thatfollowed.  Of course, you were not yet 
born, right?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  No, but I had many conversations with m y m other.This was obviously an event ver y 
m uch imprinted on herm ind.  She shared many details with m e.  She told me thaton thenight of  
 
May 9, m y parents had been askedto provide shelter to a man whowas part of  the Dutch resistance, 

and he 
carried plans in his brief case to preemptively destroy the m ajor railroad center in the city of 
Utrecht. It wasf eltby destroying that railroad center, any Germ an invasion couldbe slowed.  
 
 
As they listened to the radio May 10,1940,earl y in them orning, as they were having breakfast 
with their guest,m y parents heardthat the city of  Rotterdam , the port city of  Rotterdam  had been 

bombed anddestroyed.  Afew m inutes later,QueenW ilhelm ina of the Netherlands cam eon the 
radio andannouncedthat the Netherlands surrendered and thathergovernment was going intoexile 
in England.  
 
 
It was m y parents' guest, thism anf rom  the Dutch resistance, who was thef irst to speak up.  
He said in Dutch, " God zij dank is voorbij,"  thank God it's over.  Becausefor h
im,  this  was  jus t
 
--
 
he 
haddone allhepossibly could, and now it wa s a question of accomm odating to living under the 

occupation.  Butm y parents were aware of  all theterrible things thathadhappened to Jews in 
Germ any, and in theirhometowns
 
--
  
>> B i l
l Benson:  Because you had relatives there.  
 

 
ROUGH DRA
FT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
10
 
>> Al Munzer:  Exactly, relatives, brothers and sisters. And they looked at eachotherand looked at 
their children, and they realized that they wer e all aloneand would befacing som e major,m ajor 
d if f icu lt ie
s.   
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Nazis began im posing restrictions on Jews alm ost immediately, and you wrote 

thaton March 12, 1941, all Jewish property is Aryanized.  T ellus alittle more about that. 
 
>> Al Munzer:  It really meantthat all Jewishproperty had
 
to be registered. You know, the 
regulations that were put inplaceby the Germ an occupation started with somethingf airly sim ple,and 
that was som ething thatm ay seem  simple, the banning of  killing anim alsfor kosherm eat,andthe 
ritual slaughterof  ani
ma ls ,  if  yo u  will.   
 
 
But then it progressed very quickl y to other things, and one of them is registering Jews.  Just 
as it happened inGerm any, Jewish m en having to take anew m iddle name, Jewish wom en having to 
takea new m iddle nam e so they couldeasily
 
and always be identified as Jews.  Eventually, it 
progressed to having to register all property, which then somewhat later led tohaving to surrender the 

property.  
 
 
One episode
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Go ahead, please. 
 
>> Al Munzer:  One episode that m y mothertold me about during that period was that Jews were 

bannedf rom going to the public parks.  Likem any regulations that really don'tm ake toomuch sense, 
m y m other disobeyed the regulation. She took m y sister Lea to thepark.  A Germ an wom an 
approac
hed thebaby carriage.  My mother's heart alm ost died. T hen the woman looked at the baby, 
looked atm y sister, saw blonde curls,blueeyes, she said, Ah, you can tell this is good Aryan blood.

My m other hada sighof relief ,and she thanked the wom an. 
 
Of  course, af ter that, she never 
went back to the park.  This was just one of the many kinds of oppressive m easures, afairly m inor 
onethere, that was being taken.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1941, Ibelieve your parents enrolled one of your sisters in a Catho
lic school, or 

startedto. W hy was that?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, they f eltthat by enrolling m y sisters Eva and Lea in a Catholic school,they could 

really begin to hide their Jewish identity.  T his is also how they f orm ed a relationship with thef am ily 
th
ateventually was to hidem y sisters.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hen, of  course, November 23, 1941, alm ost19m onthsaf terthe invasionof  Holland 

by the Germ ans, youwere born.  Your parents' joy of having thebirth of a son inthe m idstof  these 
circu m st an ce s t
hat you've describedm ust have beenaccom panied by prof oundf ears ontheir part.  
Can you give us any more insight into that?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, those fears really beganwhen m y m otherf irst learned that she was pregnant.  
She m ade an appointm ent with her obstetrician, and he told her that she ought to have an abortion.  
He toldher that in no uncertainterm s.  Hetold her it was imm oralto bring another Jewish life into the 
world.  
 
 
My m other wasn't particularly reli gious at the tim e,but shedid turn
 
to theBiblefor advice.  
W hile reading the Bible, she read the story of Hannah. Hannah, you m ight recall, was a wom an who 

was desperate to have a child, and she would go to the templeevery year in Jerusalem and pray that 
shem ight conceive.  
 
 
It wa s i
n reading of Hannah's agonizing desire tohave a child, andof  Hannah's pledge, " If the

12
 
alm ighty will gi ve m ea child, I will gi ve that child to the service of God all the days of  his orher life,"  it 
was in reading that m y m otherdecided she couldnotpossibly havean abortion.  
 
 
So she was f ired by the obstetrician, and nine months later is when she gave birth tom e,with 
the help of  a nurse.  That, of  course, brought about another dilemma, because Jewish male children 
are traditionally circumcised at 8days of  age.  My parents'f riends advised ver y strongl y against 
having m e circum cised becausethat would label me as being Jewis h.  
 
 
T his tim e the answer to m y parents' dilemm a came in theform of apediatrician, who hada 
worr ied look on hisface.  My fatherasked, Isthereanything wrong with the baby?  Thepediatrician 
said, No, it's just that your son will need am inor operation we call acircumcision. 
 
 
My f athertoldhim about our Jewish tradition, and eight days laterf riendsof  thefam ily, 
neighbo
rs,everyone gathered inour hom e in The Haguef or this,for a celebration of thismilestone in 
a Jewish lif e.  
 
 
Some pictures were taken of thatevent.  Very sm all pictures. They're actually aboutonly 1 by 
1  
1/2 inch in size.  And what makes thosetwo pictures so rem arkable was thatm y motherwas to 
carry them  on her body through her subsequent stay in 12 concentration camps. She developed this 

feeling, a superstition, that if she ever lost those photographs it would mean that Ihad been killed.  
 
 
Fo r
tunately, m y m other survi ved.  T he photographs survived.  And Isurvi ved.  Those 
photographsnow are part of the collection of this m useum . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It'sastonishing tothinkthat she was able, som ehow, to keep them  with her through 

that extraord
inary ordeal.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Absolutely.

>> Bill Benson:  Over the next 10m onthsaf ter your birth, Al, leading up until September 1942, 
conditions justbecame so much worse. Every day got worse.  Somuch so that by September 1942, 
your parent decided
 
itwas tim e to go intohiding.  Tell us what they did.  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, this was obviousl y a decision that wasf aced bym any Jews in Hollandat the 

tim e. Men were being called up to go to labor camps, which was really m ore of  a euphem ism for 
co n cen
tration cam ps. Many ofthem  knew that thatm eantultimately being sent to a camp in Poland, 
which did nothave a very good reputation, even then.  
 
 
So Jews went intohiding, m adeplansto go intohiding.  Now, some fam ilies, like thefamous 
story of  Anne
 
Frank, Anne Frank'sf am ily wen t intohiding asonef am ily unit in an attic, som e were 
lik e  h e rf am ily.   
 
>> Bill Benson: T o stay together.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T o stay together.  My f am ily decided, asaform  of insurance, so that in case one 

m em be r wa s d isco
ver ed,one member of the family was discovered, at least theothers would have a 
chance to survi ve, they decided we oughtto split up.  
 
 
So thef irstones tobe placed were m y two si sters. T hey were placed with a very devout 
Ca t h o lic f a m ily.   T h e  wif e in
 
thatfam ily had avision of  the vir gin telling her totake Jewish children into 
hiding.  So m y two sisters were entrusted to that wom an andher husband.  
 
 
My f atherpretended to comm itanact of suicide,and that gained him  adm ission to a 
psychiatric hospital, as a patient, pretending to be apatient, which was tobehis hiding place.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T henwhat happened with your m other?

>> Al Munzer: W ell,my m other,of  course, was lef talone inthehouse with one last childto place, 
andthat was m e.  Male Jewish children, becausethey were circumcised, were m ore diff icult toplace.  
But eventually a neighbor of m y parents,Annie Madna, agreed to take me in, with the planthatI 
would eventually be placed somewhere in the countryside.  
 
 
She transferredm e toher sister,a wom an by thenam eof T ina Polok. T he sisterf ound out 
she hada neighbor who was a member of the Dutch Nazi party.  She got scared, passedm eback to 
Annie Madna. At thatpoint, Annie Madnadecided to passm eon to her ex
-
husband
.  Shewas 
divorced, and she passed m e to her ex
-
husband who happenedtobe an Indonesianm an, an 
im m igrantf rom Indonesia, by thenam eof Tole Madna.  He also had custody of their threechildren, 
W illy, Dewie and Robbie.  I joined those three childrenas 
the fourth m em ber of  the fam ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W e're going to come back tothat in am inute.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Sure.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Here's your mother now.  Your m other isalone, you're with the Madnafamily, your 

two sisters are with the Catholicfam ily.  Yourfather has beenadm itted because of his staged suicide.  
W hat does yourm other do now?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, she closed thehouse that we lived in all theseyears f or the very last tim e, then 
joinedm y father in the sam e psychiatric hospital, pretending tobenot a patient,butas a nurse.  So 
that was really, for her, theend of the story of thefam ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  She's pretending tobea nurse in the same psychiatric facility, but if  I rem em ber 

correctly they did notact as thoughthey knew each other at all.

reunited with m y sisters.  That was December 25, 1942.  Christm asDay, as a special gif tm y two 
sisters were brought to the psychiatric hospital, ver y stealthily.  For one last time, thatpartof the 
Munzer f am ily was reunited. T hat was the last tim e thatm y parents saw my sisters.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other later talked to you about the experience of  being inthat psychiatric 
f a c il
ity, with your f ather thereas a patient andher asanemployee. W hat did she tell you about that? 
 
>> Al Munzer:  My m other described what it was like to be in af acility with patients who had grave 

m ental illnesses. T his was before theadventof  any kind of psychotherapeutic agents, any drugs, 
and she watched people who hadbeen thereconf ined inthat hospitalf ormany years.  She saw 
people who were weari ng clothesthat were way out off ashion, that they had worn when they'd com e 
to the hospital.  
 
 B
ut theone thought that went through her m ind was that when she looked at the patients and 
she thought abouttheworld outside, she said, You know, it's the world outside that ism uch more 
disturbed andhasm uch more of am ental illness than thepeople in 
the hospital.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Crazy outside world.  
 

>> Al Munzer:  Exactly.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Al,did anybody in the hospital know that your father had feignedhis suicide and that 

was the reason he was in there?  Do you know?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I'm  not
 
sure of that. I don't know.  T here were m any Jews in hiding in that psychiatric 
hospital. T hat's what led to the psychiatric hospital,of  course,eventually being em ptiedof  all patients 

andall Jews, not just Jews but all patients and all staff working
 
there. T hey were all deported. My

parents were f irst taken toa prison.  Ironically, housed in the old hom e of  the Dutch Jewis h 
philosopher Spinoza.  Then they were sent on toa concentration cam p.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere taken, I think, am I correct,the day af ter Christmas.  Christmas Day
 
--
  
>> Al Munzer:  Actually, Ne w Year's Day 1943.  Right after.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter they'd seen your sisters.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Really, a day when many other psychiatric hospitals in Holland that had Jewish 
p
atients were emptied.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  New Year's Day?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Exactly.  That's when all of those patients inall of  those hospitals, including one where 
I've beentranslating diaries, were senttoW esterbork, to this concentration cam pon Dutch
 
s o il.   
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatkind of place was that,W esterbork? 
 
>> Al Munzer: W esterbork had been built originall y as a receiving centerfor ref ugees, Jewish 
refugees stream ing f rom  Germ any across the border intothe Netherlands.  So it really was no
t an 
unattractive facility, at leastaccording to m y m other. She saidthere were geranium splanted 
ever ywhere, curtains on the windows.  T oher it was not a terrible place.  
 
 
Subsequently, of  course, it becam e very, ver y overcrowded andbecam e, really, a
 
he llh o le , lik e  
any of  the other transitand concentration camps that were put together by the Nazis.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you noted earlier, your mother wouldend up going to 12 different cam ps.  Atone 

of  the cam ps she convinced the Germ anauthorities that she was experienced at assembling radio 
tubes. W ill you say a little about that?

>> Al Munzer:  Sure. My parents remained inW esterborkf or af ew m onths, then they wer e sent on 
to another concentration cam pon Dutch soil called Vught, inthe southern part of Holland. That's 
where m y parents were assignedtodo slavelabor in thePhillips electronicf actory.  My m other, 
through the grapevine, learned thatone of the tasksthat was essential to theGerman war eff ort was 
assembling radio tubes.  So she started doing that. That's what really kept her alive.  
 
 
My parents remained in Vughtabout six m onths. W hile there, m y motherdescribesa visit by a 
m ajor Nazi off icial, Heinrich Him m ler, and she describes how therewas a lineup in them orning at 
5 :0
0 a.m ., and Himm ler addressed all the inmates. He assuredthe inm ates that if they continued 
workin g f or the success of  the Reich, nothingbad wouldhappen to them.  
 
 
My m other tellsm e that during that speech she saw the spire of a little Dutch church way off in 
thedistance. She said to herself  it wouldbe so wonderf ul if peace were tobreak out at that m om ent 

and she could run to that church,fall onher kneesand thank Godfor her liberation. Butthat, of 
course, wasn't to happen, because f rom  there
 
m y parents were taken via W esterborkto Auschwitz, 
where they were separated andm y m other was sent on to another cam p where electronics were 

being assem bled. The Telef unken Company was housed in Reichenbach. T hat's wherem y m other 
continueddoing the s
am e  k i nd  of  wo r k .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  She also engaged in resistance.  Sheengaged in sabotage, didn't she?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, one of the joys, if  you want to call ita joy, of being at thatfactory, butwhat gave 
m y m other som e hope, let's put it that way, was that she worked alongside many Germansoldiers 
who had been repatriated f rom  theEastern Front.T hese were people who had severe injuries, who 
were m inus an arm  or leg.  They did all they could

they hated Adolf  Hitler and didall they could to

sabotage the war eff ort.  They just would throw their tools and everything else over their shoulders 
and say, Here's onef or Him mler.  Here's one for Hitler.  
 
 
My m other and some of the Jewish prisonerswere m ore subtle withsabotage.  My m other 
spent a whole day assem bling one radio tube, then when the sirenwas sounded at the end of the 
day, indicating the end, she would just disassem ble the radio tubeand put it back in the drawer, then 
thefollowing day start the whole process over again.  
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  She'sa very bra ve lady.  
 
 
You beganto tell usnow, of course,about yourself before yourm other went tothe psychiatric 
hospital.  Sheplaced you with the Madnafamily, and becausethe reason youdescribed about the 

neighbor who was a Nazi, you ended up livin g with T ole Madna and hisf am ily, his three children and 
Mim a. T ellus about life as you know it during that time with the Madna family.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Sure. W ell, theperson who really took careof m eduring thatperiod was the nanny, 
wh o
 
had taken careof the Madna children previousl y.  Her name was Mim a Saina.  Mima was born in 
Indonesia.  Shehad com eto Holland in the early 1900s,f irst to work in a restaurant, where Papa 

Madnahappened tobe the manager. W henhis children were born, he induced her to becom e a 
nanny f orhis children, and shem oved intothe Madna household.  
 
 
Mim a spoke no Dutch;she was illiterate, could not read or write.  But this woman hada heart 
of  gold. And she now really adoptedm e asher own, as her child. She becam em y m other.  
 
 
Because I was, of course, illegally in the house, thefam ily couldnotobtain ration cards, which 
were required to buy any kind of necessities. So they had to sharewhatever little they had in term s of 

food with m e,and Mima would literally have to walk m iles every day just to get som em ilkfor m e,f or

the baby.  
 
 
I slept in Mim a'sbed, I'm  told, and she kept aknife underher pillow vowing to kill any Na zi who 
m ight try to com eandget m e.  And telling people she would even kill me, if necessary, rather than 

have m ef all inthe hands of the Nazis.  
 
 
T here were tim es when the house where I was hidden with the Madnafam ily was searched. I 
was not allowed out of the house at allf ortheentire tim ethat I was there.  Theonly vie w o
f th e  

outside world I had was looking through am ail slot.  
 
 
Periodically, thehouse would be searched,and
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were with them  alm ost three years.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T hat's right, three years. Andwhat I remember is having to go into a
 
lit t le  ce lla r 
underneath the stairs. Hom es in Holland do not have basem entsassuch, so it was just a little cellar.  
And that's where the fam ily kept all their Christm asdecorations.  And one of the memories Ihave is 
playing with those Christm asdecorations, not knowing, of course, that that was am om entof  grave 
danger f or m e.  
 
 
At other tim es,Papa Madna invented som e crazy stories.  He told som e Germans that I was 
the illegitim ate child of his ex
-
wif e, andthat she now had anew boyf riend who did no
t want m e 
around. So that was another way of  really sort of  shielding m e.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T o think about that,here the Nazis are hunting every Je w they canf ind. T here you 

are, a Caucasian infant in an Indonesianf am ily's hom e.

>> Al Munzer:  Interestingly enough,f rom m y own m em ories,even later on, I was never aware of  
actually being different.  Ifelt very m uch apart of  the Madnaf am ily, and
 
W illy, Dewie andRobbie 
were m y brother and sisters.  It's som ething that really even continues today. W e now Skype each 

otheras surviving children and their grandchildren. I've always f elt part of thef am ily.  Never felt any 
difference.  
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  As you explained a m om entago, you had to stay in that hom e all the time.  So very 
few, as I recall very f ew of the Dutch neighbors, thenon
-
Indonesianfolks, knew you were there,but 
am ong their own comm unity you were known asbeing in the Madna house.  How was that possible?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, there were some peoplewho were a ware, ver y few people were aware that I 
was in the house. T he Indonesian comm unity was ver y close, andm any years later when I went to 
visit Papa Madna andwe went toan Indonesian grocery store, am an looked at Papa Madna, looked 
atm e,and there I was a grown m an,30 years old,and he said," Bobby."   
 
I should explain children placed inhiding were gi ven a new name.  I was gi ven the name 
Bobby.  Form any year s, by the way,
 
I thought I was gi ven the nam e Bobby after thedog, so if  the 
dog was being called, ifpeopleheard Bobby being called, they woul d think it was thedog being 

called. Butthen I was set straight andtoldthat, no, thedog's nam ewas reall y T eddy.  
 
[Laugh

In any event, the Indonesianfam ily, so when I went to this grocery store, thisman im mediately 
recognized m eas being Bobby.  Because, he had beenaware of m y presence inthe hom e.  
 
 
Another wom an who was aware, who Im etmany, m any years later, approachedm e, she said, 
You know, you used to drink m y m ilk. I said,W hat do you mean? She said, W ell, every day,

schoolchildren in Holland during the war years were gi ven a little bottle of m ilk, andherm other told 
her to save half the bottle f or thebaby next door.  And I was the baby next door.  
 
 
So there youhave it, a young child participating in saving a hum an life during the Holocaust.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Al,ofcourse,as you said that, they couldnot get a rationfor you.  As thewar ground 
on, by
 
the winter of 1944
-
45, which was an exceptionally bitter winter, that's oneof  them em ories you 
do have of  that winter and the deprivation that was all around. W ill you say a little more about that?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, that was a time of terrible hunger in Holland. There was really nof ood available, 
andpeople say thateven dogs and catshaddisappeared. T he only thing that was lef t to eat at the 
tim e was tulipbulbs, which Holland, of course, hasm any of . So tulip bulbs wouldbe ground up, and 
th a
t's what we would have asf ood. That's what we would have to subsist on.  
 
 
I remember onenightwaking up ver y hungr y and seeing a table set for breakf ast thef ollowin g

T he other thing, the other object thatI donated tothe museum  isone that Iused to bring to 
these whenever we had a 
Fi rs t  Pe rs o n
 
interview, but now has gotten very f ragile.  It was a barrel.  I 
rem em bered that the barrel was actually a liquor cabinet, and I remem bered as a child seeing this 
ver y big barrel in the house.  And then som eyears ago, about10 years ago when I visited the Madna 
fam ily, and I told them  the story about the barrel, they pointed tothis little barrel sitting there
.

with them . I wondered what are they

what the heck do they have in that duff le bag? I opened it up, 
there was the barrel, with abottle of Dutch gin inside. 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
For m any years I hadthe barrel in the house,but with the clim ate inW ashington it beganto 
deteriorate, so If inally donated it also tothem useum , and it'snow also part of the collection of the 

US Holocaust Mem orial Museum . 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hich is fabulous. 
 

 
Your two sisters, Al, Eva and Leana,as youexplained, were hidden with this Catholic wom an 
who had a vision. T ragically, 16 months after their placement withher, they were taken by the SS. 

W ill you tell us about that?

>> Bill Benson:  In af it of  rage. 
 
>> Al Munzer:  In af it of rage. And the Germans tookhis wif e andm y two sisters.  His wif e 
eventually was f reed.  She was im prisonedf or a while but was thenfreed.  But m y two sisters were 
im mediately taken to the sam e cam pthat had housed m y parents,W esterbork, and then two days 
later were takenf rom W esterbork, in February 1944,exactly 70 years ago this year, to Auschwit z, 
where they were im m ediately sentto the gaschamberand killed. And they were only 6 and 8 years 
old at the time.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid your m om  learnabout whathappened toher two daughters, your two 

sist e rs?   
 
>> Al Munzer:  I'm  notentirely sure.  You know, m y m other was liberated in April 1945 through the 

interventionof  thehead ofthe Swedish RedCross, Count FolkeBernadotte, who interviewed on 
behalf  of several thousand womenand negotiated their f reedom with Him m ler. 
 
 
She was taken, she was liberatedat the Danish border af ter going from  one camp to another 
as the Germ an Arm y retreated. Horrible, horrible thing ref erred toas the deathmarch.  Peoplehad 
ve r y,  v
ery l ittle to eat,no clothing, and just going across all these cam ps, until she was f inally 
liberated atthe Danish border, and greeted by Count FolkeBernadotte andtaken to Sweden, where 
she was lef t to recuperate.  
 
 
I don't know whether it was while in Sweden that she learned of thefateof m y two sisters or 
whether it was later, when she returned to the Netherlands, to Holland inAugust1945.  
 
 
My m other toldm e that the shock was so severe, andof  course, you know, any thought 
brought tears to hereyes, and shehad real diff iculty coping with that kind of loss. But shealso

realized thatpeopledid not want to see tears.  Som e people sort oftold her tobe quiet, and so she 
would squeeze her hands whenever shef elttears com ing or welling in hereyes, so severely that she 
actually developed an infection inher hands.T hat was m y m othertrying to cope with thenews of  the 
lo ss.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when she isf inally liberated,12 camps, hard labor, a deathm arch, she f inally is 

liberated, she com es
 
back af ter the war in May of 1945. T ellus what happened there. There you 
are, part of the Madna fam ily asf aras you knew.  
 

>> Al Munzer:  T hat'sone of thef irst very clear m em ories that Ihave.  It's of the day m y mother came 
back.  That's the term  
we all use.  Not "survive," but" cam e back."  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you rem em ber that day?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I rem em berthat day ver y wel l.  I hadbeen asleep in theback room  where I usually 
slept,and som eone in thefam ily, one of m yfoster sisters, came 
over to get m e and wake me up.  
Like any other child that's being awakened, Istartedto cry and was cranky.  
 
 
I was takento the living room , where theentiref am ily was sitting in a circle.  In a very typic al 
wa y, som ething that you do with a crying child , I was passedf rom  lap to lap,and there was one lapI 

wouldn't sit in,and that was m y m other's lap.She was a complete stranger to m e. My own m other 
was a stranger, because I already had am other, and that was Mim a, Mim a Saina. That'swhen I 
f ina ll
y sat in Mim a's lap and I quited down.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid your m om dothenwith you at that point? 
 

>> Al Munzer: W ell,my m other realized that it would be very, ver y di ff icult to separate me.

>> Al Munzer:  Abruptly f rom  Mim a. She really appreciated how Mim ahad taken care ofm e, and so 
she invited Mima to becom e part of our household and to continue to care for me while m y m other 
went looking for work.  
 
 
Shealready, at that tim e I think, had learned that m yf ather probably had died.  She didnot 
have any def initive news.  So she knew shewould have to go out to work.  And so arrangem ents 

were m adefor Mima to stay with us.  
 
 
Now, just to get usedto being alone with m e, m y m other sent Mimato am ovie. She gave
 
her 
tickets to see am ovie,which was really still a novelty im m ediately af ter the war.  And Mimaleft the 

house, andthenf ive minutes later she cam eback inthe house,and she wagged herf inger atm y 
m other, she said, Don't hit him . That's how protective Mim a was of m e.  She did not eventrust m y 
own m other to carefor m e.  
 
 
T hen, sadly, two m onths later, Mim a suff ered a cerebral hemorrhage and passed away.  Som e 
people said that she really died of  a brokenheart, becauseher baby was being taken away 
f rom  her.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter Mim a had passed, what do you know aboutyour adjustment back,both your 
adjustm ent back with your mother and your mother'sadjustm ent,and whether ornot you had 
connectionstothe Madnafam ily still af terthat?  I know you have them now, butduring that tim e.  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell,my m otherhad to gof ind work, as I said,and initially she tried to sell som e of  

them aterials that hadbeen lef t over f rom m y father's business. Butthen she realized thatwould 
m ean having to leavem e alone with caregive rs, and shedidn't want that.  So she was able to 
purchase a cosmeticsbusiness, and so that's how we li ved thef irstfew years af ter the war, until we

I visited the concentration cam p, when
 
I visited Ebensee and stoodat his gravesite.  Iburst out in 
tears. Thathad never happenedbefore. And it happened twice.  Thatf irst tim e, when m y m other 

tookm ethere in 1958, just before we em igrated to the United States.  Shefelt we ought tosay 
goodbye, if  you will, to m y father's grave. T hen when I returned in1995, the same thing happened. I 
visited his grave, and again I burstout in tears.  Because, the reality of the lossof m y father and what 
m ight have been justhit m e very hard.  
 
 
T he

m issedout on, because of this terrible horror.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Al, in addition to your own nuclearf am ily, your sisters and yourf ather, you lostother 
relatives f rom  an extendedfam ily as well.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Yes.  The only personf rom my m other'sfam ily to survi ve was a brother, who 

m anaged to escapef rom  Germ any, f rom Berlin, oneof  the very last to escapeto Bolivia. 
 
To this day, 
I still have som e relatives living in Bolivia andin Chile.  So that'sabout the extent of m y imm ediate 

fam ily.  Although, you know, periodically I learn aboutother people,m ore distant relatives.

to Australiaf rom  there.  I was just at the convention center here inW ashington, saw the exhibit, and 
there was aphotograph of one of the relatives.  So
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  FromShanghai?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  From  Shanghai. Abeautif ulexhibit.  Oneof  thefew places that had opened its doors 
to Jewish ref ugees, a thing that obviously didnotoccur in the United States or in most other 
countries.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. Al, in the little time we have lef t,I would like you to share with us two other 

things, if  you don'tm ind.  One is,thef irst would be, you've been able to get the Madnafam ily 
recognized for what they didf or you, inIsrael.  If  you will tell us about that. 
 
 
T hen, if you would, extraordinary recentdevelopments in your life. I m ean,extraordinary.  You 
have a guest here with you in thef ront row, Racelle, who I will introduce. Af ter you spoke
 
to a group 
of  Indonesian students at Tem ple University i n Philadelphia last year.  
 

 
If you don'tm ind, maybe telling us aboutthose two.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I rem ained in very close contact with the Madnafam ily, still ver y m ucha part of  the 

Madna fam ily. 
 
For exam ple, 9/11,the first telephone call I received was f rom Dewie Madna, m y 
foster sister, wanting to be sure I was OK. That continuesuntil thepresent time.  
 
 
T he Madnafam ily was singled outf oranhonor in Israel, in Jerusalem ,at the YadVashem
 
Holocaust memorial. T hey were recogni zed as righteousamong the nations. T hey arethe only two 

thathave the name Indonesia, Mim aSaina andT ole Madna that have the name Indonesiaaf ter their 
name.  
 
 
So a little over a year ago, a professor inIndonesia got wind of this story.  He was trying to

honor anIndonesianfam ily that haddone som ething wonderf ul,and he said,Well, letm ehonor 
som eonef rom  the Indonesian diaspora who lived in Holland,and cam eonPapa Madna's story.  T hat 
story, in turn, was shared very quickl y with RacelleW eim an, sitting here with m e.  Racelle, at that 
tim e,had a contract wi th the USState Departm ent, still does,tobring Indonesian studentsandother 
foreign students totheUS to teach them about religious pluralism .  She invitedmeto speak to her 
class. W e didn't tell the class anything aboutm ebeforehand.  
 
 
T hen, when I showed them thef irst photograph, which was of  Mim a Saina holding m e, Iasked 
them ,W hat do you see? They said, well, obviousl y, an Indonesianwom an. 
 
W hen  I t o l d t he m I  was 
thebaby she was holding, there was a gasp in the room . Af ter that,I had their undivided attention.  
 
 
At the very, ver y end, I told them , you know, Mim a used to sing a lullaby to me, and it was 
called Nina Bobo.  All 25 students 
started singing the lullaby in perfect unison.  An incredible, 
incredible,m oving mom ent.  
 
 
W ell, thatm oment was shared with the Indonesianambassador to the United States, andhe 
invited m eto tell that story at theIndonesianEm bassy, invited 200people to hear the story.  T hen 
invited m eto come to Indonesia,urgedm e tocom e toIndonesia, really, to share the story there.  
Racelle and Ihavem ade one visit together to Indonesia.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Afew m onthsago.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Few m onths ago. Very m oving experience where I spoketo400 students. I had the 
sam e wonderf ulexperience, this tim e400 students singing the same lullaby.  Now we're pl anning to 
createa docum entary bringing the story of my sur vi val, the story of  the heroism of the Madna 
f a m ily 
back to the Indonesian people,because wefeel very strongl y that it is a story that belongs there.  It's 

 
ROUGH DRA

a story thatthe Indonesians deserve to be proudof . So we have begun tomake plansfor the 
docum entary, and, God willing, we'll return to Indonesia laterthis year to actually begin tofilm  that 
docum entary.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's outstanding. W e're going to close the program  in justam om ent.  I'm  going to 

turn back to Al to close our program.  Bef ore I do that, I want to thank all of you for being here with us 
f o r 
F i rs t  P e rs on
. W edidn't have timefor question andanswer. W e couldhave spent a lot longer this 
af ternoon with Al.  But Al, you can stay behindf or a little while?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Absolutely.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  If anybody would like toaska question, pleasefeel f ree to com e talk to him  
af terwards, or just say hi, whatever you want to do.  Pleasetake advantage of  that when we're done.  
 
 
W hen Al isdone, I'm also going to ask if  all ofyou would stand, because our photograph
e r,  
Joel, is going to come up on stage and get aphotographof  Alfacing him, but with you as the 
backdrop.  Itm akes a really nice pictureof  Albeing here at 
First  Pe rso n
.  
 
 
It's our tradition at 
Fi rs t P e rs o n
 
that our First Person gets the last word.  So on thatnote, I'm  
going to turn itbackto Al to close our program . I know, if  you're like me, you've got many other things 
you would like to have heardabout. W e'llf ind anotheropportunity.  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, as you go through thePerm anent Exhibition you will learn about the horrors, the 

evil of  the Holocaust.  T hat is,unfortunately,m ostof the story of  the Holocaust.  But tom e, the 

am azing thing, really, is that in that seaof evil  it was possiblefor afew people, like the Madnafam ily, 

to  s
tandupand to dowhat is right, to makethat choice.  It'sbecause, of course, of thosepeople that I 
am alive, andother survi vors that areheredoing volunteer work at the Holocaust Museum . If only 

therehad beena thousand of thosef orevery one who did stand up, there would have been no 

Holocaust.

I thinkthe Holocaust is the result of incredible hatred, andI think the one lessonthat Ihope 
people will take away as they vis it them useum ,as they listen tom y story, is to where hatred can 
lead, th
at hatred can really lead eventually to people being killed, tom urder.  So them ost im portant 

lessonfor each andevery one of us is to really banish hatredf rom our hearts.
