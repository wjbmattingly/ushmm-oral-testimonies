ROBERT A. BELFER 
 April 20, 2006 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: It™s very nice to see you, 
Mr. Belfer, after all these m
onths of talking on the phone. 
A: And very good to be with you. 

Q: Tell me , what was your name  when you were born? 

A: My Polish name  was Roma n, and my
 Hebrew name was Avraham Yas huah. 
Q: And your last name ?  

A: Belfer. 

Q: Belfer. And you™re now known as? 

A: As Robert Alexander Belfer. 
Q: And whe r e™d the Alexander come  from? 
A: My cousin, one of my  mother™s
 sister™s children, ma rried a fe
llow by the name  of Shie Faigel, 
and he also was a Yashuah and he changed the 
name  to Alexander. So I felt that it was 
appropriate as an American to have a 
mi ddle name , so I followed his example. 
Q: I see. And when were you born? 

A: In March 27
th
 of 1935. 
Q: And whe r e? 

A: I was born in the town of Hajow in Silesi
a where -- near the German border, where my 
parents happened to be living briefly. 

Q: But you weren't raised there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

A: I was re -- raised in Kr aków. 
Q: In Kraków. And wha t  did your father do? 

A: My father was a processor of feathers and 
down. He would buy the ra
w feathers from Polish 
far mers, separate the feathers from the down and 
then market them separately. He had a factory 
in Kraków that did the separation. 

Q: Huh. And did your mother work as well? 

A: Bef -- my mother worked in her family™s tr
avel office, and my father, as a result of his 
business, ma rketing the feathers and downs, did a lo
t of traveling. So he ha
ppened to visit travel 
office, and he found wha t  he thought was an attr
active young gal, he courted her and ma rried her. 
Q: So she lived in Kraków? 

A: Kraków. 

Q: Kraków. 

A: Yes, yes.  
Q: And do you reme mbe r  the house where you were living? 
A: It was -- 

Q: Or the apartment? 

A: It was an apartment. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was, I believe, on the second floor. And fr
om what I reme mber it was quite a -- a nice 
apartment from the persp
ective of a very young child. 
Q: Now I know that your -- your dad left Poland when?  Wa s it after the wa r started, do you 

reme mber?  Or do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

A: Yes, I do know. Oka y, on August 23
rd
, 1939, when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non-
aggression pact, there was the fear
 of war in the air in Poland. Th
is was particularly true with 
respect to my father. Wh en the Nazis got into
 power, they establis
hed all kinds of trade 
restrictions. My father was e
xporting feathers to Germany. Wh
ile he was visiting Germany, he 
was arrest ed, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-ru
les. He was able to post bail, and he actually 
jumped bail. So he knew that if Nazis ever got in
to Poland, that he would be picked up. With the 
encouragement of my mother who 
said to him that if you are in  Poland you will be arrested, if 
you™re out of Poland, you ma y be he -- able to help
 us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the 
country. It being late August, my father™s pare
nts, being religious, said, the high holidays are 
comi ng, you should wait and leave until after the holidays. Well, my father left Poland from the 
port of Gdynia, or Gdansk in late
 August, with the last
 ship to leave a Polish port before the war 
started. 

Q: Wo w. 
A: While he was in the mi ddle of the Atlantic, September first came along, with the outbreak of 
the war, and clearly, if he had listened to his 
parents rather than his 
wife, I wouldn™t be here. 
Q: Right. Now, you s -- you were very young, so 
do you have any recollections from your own 
me mory of your father leaving?  
Do you reme mb er that day, or -- 
A: I reme mb er that my fa ther would take a numbe r of
 trips, but I can™t tell 
you at this point that I 
reme mber this departure. He had previously gon
e to the United States, where s -- the ship was 
going, on -- on a -- business trips.
 So I think to my young mi nd, the difference between this 
business trip and other busine
ss trips, was not apparent. 
Q: Right. Do you reme mber feeling any anxiety in
 the house because of a possible war and then 
the war comi ng?  Do you -- do you ha
ve a recollection of that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

A: Well, my  recollection is that  when the war came
, we fled to my father™s village, ni -- which 
was relatively close to Kraków
, called We rdiswow. In my ow
n mi nd, and perhaps this is 
fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the A
nna Tefka. And as -- so we felt it being a small 
village, it was a quote, safer place to be
 with the Nazis swarmi ng all over Poland. 
Q: So it was you and your mother, your
 two sisters, and anyone else? 
A: We ll, when we were in We rdiswow, we were 
with my father™s extended fa mily, his parents. 
He was one of seven children, there were three boys
 and four girls, and my
 father was the oldest, 
and so there were a lot of 
Belfers around in We rdiswow. 
Q: Right. 
A: And you know, some  of them 
had children, and I suspect that
 there were, you know, close 
fa mily friends. So I do reme mber that one night 
when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the 
night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, some how feeling that
 that was safer than staying 
in our homes. That there was the noise of artille
ry in the background. And I am told a story about 
myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me , but
 it doesn™t, that appare
ntly in the mi ddle of 
the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and ju
st relieved mys e lf to the expense of a sleeping 
neighbor. 

Q: And who told you this story? 

A: My parents, and my sist
ers would tease me  about it. 
Q: I see. Now, you had two older sisters. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Can you give us their name s, please? 

A: Yes, there was my sister Selma who was three years older, and my sister Anita who was just 

one year older than I.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
5 
 
 
Q: Do you reme mber them in Poland?  Do you reme mber being with them?  
A: Well, I reme mber that my si
ster Anita, who was then called Hanka by her Polish name , had a 
nanny ma id by the name  of Topja. And apparently
 Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed 
to be looking after all three of
 us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita. Also reme mber being told 
that when she was two and I was one, that I was 
as big as she was. And, by the way, I was told 

that I was a 10 pound baby. Obvi
ously I can™t prove it. 
Q: Right. That™s pretty big. 

A: And that I was a muc h better 
eater, you know, and that I would 
eat the food off Ha nka™s plate. 
Q: With her permission, or you simply went there? 

A: We ll, she would, I think ha -- was happily ac
quiescing at being relieved of the burden of 
eating. Having grandchildren of various temperaments -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- I know some  of them are more like I-I am, and some  are more like my sister. 
Q: I see. Let me  go back for a second. You -- because not everybody who watches this will know 
what you meant when you said -- when you went to
 this little town it 
was like Anna Te fka to 
you. What does that me a n? 

A: That it would be a small east European vill
age with largely unpaved streets, and probably 
chickens running around the place, and most 
of the me n being bearded, and Yiddish being 
spoken -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- much more so than Polish. 

Q: And Ann a  Tefka actually refers
 to a town in a musical, yes? 
A: Yes, that™s -- it is the name of the -- 
a fi ctional town in ﬁF
iddler on the Roof.ﬂ  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

Q: Right. 
A: Which of course has now become an American icon. 

Q: Right. Your -- where did your father go when 
he left?  He didn™t get 
to the United States? 
A: Wa  -- he did. 

Q: He did? 

A: Yes. By that -- the boat on which he was 
on sailed to New York. He was permitted entry to 

the United St ates as a business person on a busin
ess visa. While he was in the mi ddle of the 
Atlantic, the zlotys, the Polish currency that
 he  had with him became worthless overnight. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: When he got to Ellis Island, he was given 
five dollars by HIAS, the Hebrew Immi grant Aid 

Society, and -- in or der to have the wherewithal to 
get off. And he ma de c ontact, reme  -- as I said 

before, he had been to the U.S. previously. 

Q: Right. 
A: He had business contacts, and they initially 
helped him out and he went to work for them, 
initially as an employee, and he shou -- he sh
or tly became their partner.
 Because he was aware 
that the war had actually broken out, and because wa
rs create scarcity, when he used hi s business 
contacts to send cables to -- which wa s th
e pre-internet way 
of communic a ting -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to Europe, asking for quotations on feathe
rs and down. And whatever quote he got, which 
was then above the ma rket, he responded yes. Wh
en the me rchandise arrived, and the fact of the 
war had been more widely recognized, the feathe
rs and downs had appreciated in value, he was 
able to then sell them at
 a profit and get started.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
7 
 
 
Q: Huh. Now, was he able to communicate with your
 -- with your mother and the family at all, 
do you reme mber? 
A: There -- the ma il service was working. I think 
that there was an exchan
ge of letters. I don™t -- 
don™t believe there was any telephones -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- that time that were functioning on a 
U.S. to Poland -- to occupied Poland -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- relationship. 

Q: You don™t have those letters? 

A: No, I do not. 

Q: No. So how long was you father in the United States then?  

A: We ll, the -- my -- because he had a business vi
sa, rather than an immi
gration visa, he had -- 
he applied as a hardship case as a refugee from 
a occupied country. But he had to leave the U.S. 
and go to Canada and -- to be permitted to re-e
nter the United States 
on an immi grant status. 
Obviously with the war raging in Europe, he 
was happy to be able to stay in the U.S. 
Q: Right. Now, in the meantime, your mother is
 trying to get out of 
Poland, is that correct? 
A: Now, in the meanti me my father was preoccu
pied not only with trying to ma ke a buck, but 
getting his fa mily out of Poland. And he had with him -- and I™m hoping I can actually get you a 

copy of wha t  I would call a life-saving photograph. It
 was a picture of his wi
fe and three children 
that he had with him, and util
izing that picture, and -- let™s 
just say the cooperation of the 
consulate of the Republic of Nicaragua, he was able
 to obtain for his family, citizenship papers 
of Nicaragua, then a neutral country. My mother 
won -- who was a little bit 
older than my father, 
grew up when there was no Poland. It was part 
of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and so she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
8 
 
 
spoke a perfect Hoke Deutsch. And the Germans 
-- I mean, I can go into some detail about her 
contacts with them, did not speak Spanish, and so
 she conversed with them as a citizen of a 

neutral country, not as a Jew, not
 as a Pole. To the best of my knowledge, she ne -- we never had 
to wear yellow stars. 

Q: Hm. So s he™s communicating in Poland, to get out of Poland, yes? 

A: So as -- as the holder of a citizenship pape
rs of Nicaragua, she applied to leave the Third 
Reich. She was told that in order to leave the Th
ird Reich, that she had to
 go to Berlin. But if I 
ma y, there are a couple of things that I do 
reme mber before our departure for Berlin. 
Q: Absolutely, tell me.  

A: Well, I reme mber that it snowed a lot, and 
that I reme mber holding my mother™s hand as we 
walked the streets in Kraków, and the way that s
now gets shoveled into p
iles on the edge of the 
sidewalk, it seemed to me as a little ki d that  the 
piles of snow were as ta
ll as I was. I reme mber 
that if we would walk in the st
reets and we™d come  across Nazi s-
soldiers, that well, you could -- 
my -- my mother would definitely
 show fear which I could feel. 
Q: Cause you were holding her hand. 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: So did she grab you tightly? 

A: I think she -- I think that she would hold ont
o me  a little tighter. Now, I have shown you some  
pictures of myself, probably taken in the summe r  
of ™39. And modesty aside, I had blue eyes, and 
blonde golden curls. And there was a fear that 
the Germans would take some  eastern European 
children who looked like Aryans, take them awa y 
from their fa mily and raise them as Germans. 
So my mother cut ou -- had all my hair cut off to
 make me look less entici
ng to the Germans. My 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
9 
 
 
hair never grew back blonde. I™m
 sure it wouldn™t have -- it woul
d have turned color anyway, but 
it™s a stor y that I mi  -- th
at I kind of enjoy telling. 
Q: Did she actually cut off all your hair? 
A: I can™t say that I have any 
pictures of myself post haircu
t, so I can™t give you a precise 
answer, but certainly you can see from the phot
os I have, that I had an abundance of golden 
curls. 

Q: Right. Which were cut off. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right. Do you reme mber seei
ng these Nazi soldiers when you were walking?  Or do you only 

reme mber your mother™s response, do you think? 

A: So -- I know I reme mber seei
ng Nazi soldiers in Berlin, and 
subsequently when we ended up 
in Madrid. 

Q: Right. 
A: So I can™t be sure -- 
Q: Where, yeah, right. 

A: -- just  where I saw them -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but I certainly do reme mber
. Also, I mi ss -- I -- I also reme mber very clearly my  -- a 
German offi cer would knock on the door of our
 apartment in Kraków, accompanied by one or 
two soldiers. And they woul
d referto my mother, who 
spoke perfect German, as 
[indecipherable] frau, gracious la
dy, which was the appropriate way 
to greet a respected stranger. 
And they would come  and borrow a furniture for the 
duration of the war. In short, they stole it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
10 
 
 
And because there was this polite officer, you know, who request -- or looked very tall to me , as 
did most adults. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- you know, didn™t get any sens
e of fear out of it, but I do reme mber, you know, these visits 
where, you know, there was no sense of compensa
tion or anything like that. The Germans took 
whatever they wanted to take. 

Q: Right. 

A: I also reme mber two other thi
ngs from pre-war Poland, and that 
is that we used to visit my 
father™s parents in Werdiswow, and I reme mber
 his brothers, including one of them, Norman, 
who is still alive and in the U.
S., playing with me and picking 
me  up and standing me  on top of a 
very tall dresser and I 
just thought this was, 
you know, very exciting. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And you know, so a family was a very big part of -- of our lives. 
Q: Right. 
A: I also reme mber that in summers we woul
d go to Wr oclaw in [indecipherable] southern 
Poland, as a fa mily and while I don™t have specific
 recollections, it kind 
of rings of a pleasant 
me mory.  

Q: Mm-hm. So it™s understandable as a young kid, 
you have these vague -- certain very specific 
me mories, but th-the history is much vaguer for you. 

A: I-It is. I can™t really be 
much more specific than -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- what I™ve said here. Now, after the war star
ted, I do reme mber that my sister S-Selma, who 
used to go and play in the stre
ets with her cousin, who also was Hanka, and was the daughter of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
11 
 
 
my mother™s brother, so her name  wa s Hanka 
Annisfeld, and she was no longer allowed to go to 
play in the street, and I suspect I wasn™t eith
er. And norma lly I would have been starting school, 
probably that September, but with the outbreak 
of the war, whatever forma l  schooling I mi ght 
have had was deferred. 
Q: Right. Were you -- did your 
two sisters go with you and your mother when she was going to 

the German embassy to try to 
get out of Poland?  Did you know -- 

A: I -- I think that you -- see, 
to try and -- and clarify, we -- we
 were able to go by train from 
Kraków to Berlin. 

Q: Right. 

A: We  were put up at a mother 
-- at a mother and children™s ho
me  [indecipherable] kinderheim, 
and while we were there, my -- my mother would 
take me to visit one co
nsulate after another to 
try and get visas so that we coul
d leave the Third Reich. I suspect I was not as well behaved as I 
should have been, so rather th
an leaving me  at home where I 
could be annoying our neighbors, 
and just sort of realiz
e that here I was speaking Polish, and 
all our neighbors were German and 
they obviously weren™t too crazy about us. And so
 it would have been rather risky to antagonize 
them. So I went with her, generally by subw
ay, and I reme mb er being on the [indecipherable] 
and my two sisters, who are only slightly olde
r than I was, were left to stay at home. 
Q: Cause they were 
quieter than you were? 
A: Yeah, they were better behaved than I was, 
and I™m not quite sure how they occupied their 
time. But in any case, they -- they stayed home 
while I went with my mother. And I mi ght add 
that while we were -- the first visa
s that we were able to obtain was to go from Berlin to Moscow 
to Shanghai and then hopefully the United States. To
 put this in a chronological time frame, we 
left Kraków in March of 1941. When I saw the movie,
 ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ I 
realized that we left 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
12 
 
 
Kraków a week or two before all the Jews we
re rounded up in the ghetto. I™ve always wondered 
whether we weren't very lucky in getting out 
just in the ni ck of time. And I mention the 
chronology because we were in Berlin for a total of
 four months. Was not a -- a quick or easy st -
- stay from March through July 
of ™41, and as -- as -- on June 22
nd
 of ™41, we were getting ready 
to leave for Moscow, the Nazis in
vaded the Soviet Union, Operati
on Barbarosa, and that avenue 
of exit was closed to us. We subsequently we
re able to get permission to go through Vichy, 
France to Spain, and that™s -- th
at™s a-another chapter. But be
fore I leave this, and the RAF 
would come  over most every night and drop 
bombs on Berlin. They had no idea where the 
bombs were dropping. It was more 
like a -- an annoyance, but it 
meant that just about every 
night, we would have to go down to air raid shelte
rs. And I reme mber there was at least one time  
when a bomb fell pretty close to the building 
where we were and that
 needless to say, shook up 
pe -- shook up the people mo -- in more than on
e way. Getting up in the mi ddle of the night and 
going to the baseme nt seemed more like adventure to me  -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- you know, and I -- now that 
I think back, I wonder how the 
Germans who were in the air 
raid shelter with us, felt about this foreign fam
ily who was in their mi dst. The only thing I can 
say is that I don™t re
call any act of verbal or phy
sical harassme nt. To thatextent I will say that I 
appreciated the, shall we say, self discipline. 

Q: Right. 

A: But it is, you know, some thing th
at I quite clearly reme mb er. 
Q: Did they know that you were Jewish, or 
do you think they thought 
that you were Polish? 
A: I had -- I regret that I didn™
t ask that very question to my 
mother, because only my mother 
could give a defi nitive answer. I will say this, we 
did not have  to have any i -- wear  ye llow stars 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
13 
 
 
or anything else that identifie
d us as -- you know, physically as
 being Jewi sh, and that my 
mother did speak this perfect German. 
Q: Right. 

A: So -- and realize that ther
e were German i mmi grants who 
had move d to Central and South 
America, I mean particularly countries like Arge
ntina. And so we could have been -- possibly 
been viewed as Germans  who 
moved to Nicaragua, temporarily ended up in Poland, and were 
going back. Again -- 

Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: -- I-I just -- I wish I ha
d asked, I wish I could give
 you a -- a precise answer. 
Q: Do you reme mber later on seeing your
 passport, did it have a J in it? 

A: Oh, our -- we had a Nicaraguan paper -- 

Q: Oh yeah, right, so it woul
d have an [indecipherable] 
A: -- and so it wouldn™t have -- 
Q: Right. So you left Poland with Nicaraguan papers? 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Cause you were then Nicaragua
n citizens according to that? 
A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: Now, what happened to your grandpa
rents, did they stay in Poland? 
A: Okay, my grandparents ended up in Auschwitz. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And they were both killed. 

Q: Right. And this was 
your father™s parents? 
A: My -- I™m sorry, we™re talki
ng about my father™s parents. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
14 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: My father had four sisters, they all ended up 
on a boat, a ship, and it was put out to sea, and 
sunk by the Nazis and they all 
perished. My father™s two 
younger brothers ended up in 
concentration camps. They went through a series
 of harrowing experiences, being mo ved from 
one camp to another, especially 
as the Russians were advancing, 
but they ma naged to survive, 
ended up in Italy at the end of the war, and with
 my father™s help, star
ted up a feather and down 
business and subsequently emigrated to the Unit
ed States, and of the 
two brothers, one passed 
away a long time ago from cancer, 
and the other one, the youngest, Norma n, is about 83 years 
old, still alive, and except for ha
rd of hearing, is in good health. 
Q: Right. We have to change the tape. 
End of Tape One

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Did you ask your mo ther when you were -- 
as you were traveling, what™s happening to 
Grandma and Grandpa, or did you just think -- 
were you conscious that
 there was a war going 
on?  Did you realize some th
ing funny was happening? 
A: Having -- going to air raid 
shelters almost every night, 
it was impossible not to -- 
Q: Not to. 
A: -- realize that there™s a wa
r going on, and yes there was a gene
ral anxiety, but again, I don™t 
think I really felt it. I don™t have
 the sense of a fearful childhood. It
 was in -- in some  ways from 
my young perspective, an adventur
e as much as anything else. 
Q: It™s interesting, isn™t it, that at such 
a young age, with bombs falling, that you don™t recall a 
fearsome  childhood. It
™s interesting. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So your mother must have been very -- you mu
st have felt very close and safe with her. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Don™t you think?  Is it -- 

A: Yes, I-I do, and I mean, I -- when I think about 
the complaints that I hear from various fa mily 
and friends living in this count
ry, about what they think are harrowing problems, and I think 
about what it was that my mother underwent, I 
mean, living in mortal fear of losing all three 
children. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It does give you a surge of respect of -- 

Q: And it hurts you. 

A: Ah, it -- yes, it gives me endless 
admi ration for my -- for my mother. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
16 
 
 
Q: Yeah. Okay. We ™ll stop the tape. What happe
ned to you just a few mi nutes ago?  We just 
stopped the tape. What -- what was it that was 
going through your -- you --
 your head about your 
mother, you think? 
A: I believe that my mot her did some extraordin
ary things to bring her 
children out of a death 
trap. But that wa -- it is hard for me  to think a
bout her and the fact that 
she passed away at a very 
early age of 58, that -- that she 
was dealt an unfair h-hand in life
. I™m sorry. It just upsets me  
[indecipherable]. I feel silly crying, but I -- I -- I 
loved her. I owe my life 
to her. Maybe I™m quite 
a hardboiled business executive, and so
 this is quite an emotional out
burst for me, and I st -- I -- I 
think I have now gotten it quote, out 
of my system. But it is just a f
act of my view that this is a 
wonderful woma n who I loved dearly and 
who was dealt an unfair hand by fate. 
Q: I™m assumi ng you told her what you felt. 

A: She knew it without being told. 

Q: Mm-hm. She must have been quite a specia
l person. So, you want to get to Madrid now? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What -- what were you doing fo
r four months though, in Berlin, 
tell me . You we re just going 
around with your mother to the 
-- to get -- try to get out? 
A: Well, I know that we spent a lot of time going from one consulate to the next, and because 

most children that age were going 
to school and I wasn™t, I have a 
bit of a hard time  fi guring out 
what it was that I was doing with my time. It ma
y be that because my ni
ghts were interrupted by 
going down to the air raid shelter, that I ma y 
have slept more during the day, but otherwise I 
suspect I quote, played with my
 sisters, and I know that sinc
e Polish was the only language I 
could speak, I certainly wasn™t 
playing with the other kids w
ho happened to have been around.

Q: Di -- do you recall your mother
 saying, Robert, or r -- she pr
obably called you Roma n at that 
time, yes, be careful, or don™t go outside? 
A: No, actually, they used the dimi nutive of Roman, which was Rome k. 

Q: Rome k. 

A: And Rome k is what became Robert. 

Q: I see, so that™s -- makes more sens
e as to how it moved to Robert, right. 
A: Okay.  

Q: So did she warn you, don™t use Polish, keep quiet? 

A: I know we tried to keep a low profile, since 
as I alluded to, we -- we -- clearly we were 
foreigners in a country that wa
s at war with all of the nationa
list fervor that being a-at war 
implies. And so keeping not only my self, but my  two sisters, you know, in a low profile, must 

have been quite a challenge and a burden to my mother. 

Q: Right. Did you have enough food, do you reme mber? 
A: I believe that we were given ration cards, I™
m not certain. And I do remember that while we 
were in Poland, and we -- reme mber, we were there for a year and a half -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- under Nazi occupation -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- from September ™39, til March ™41 that the va
riety of food seemed to have dimi nished. That 
you couldn™t get the kinds of things that you could 
before the war. But I don™t recall every being 
hungry. 

Q: Right. Do you recall your pare
nts being re-religious in Pola
nd?  Or se-semi-religious, how 
would you describe it?  If you know. I don™t know if you even know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
18 
 
 
A: I -- I know -- I mean that -- 
that we observed the Sabbath, a
nd obviously the high holidays. I 
don™t have any specific recollect
ions of, you know, going to a s
ynagogue or anything like that. 
Q: Right. And were you kosher at home? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You were. 

A: Oh yes. And we were kosher when
 we go to this country as well. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you ma intained that throughout the tr
a -- even the travels, 
to -- to get here.  
A: I suspect that we -- when we were in c
ountries like Berlin -- you know, in Germany and in 
Spain, that we weren™t perhaps as stri
ctly kosher as we mi ght have wanted. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: But we -- there wasn't a choice. 

Q: Right. Do you reme mber going to Spain? 

A: Yes. 
Q: You remember it?  Ye s? 
A: Yes.  

Q: What do you reme mb er? 

A: We ll, I reme mber that we stayed at a hotel 
in Madrid and in the ho
tel lobby was an over life 
size portrait of Adolf Hitler. I re
me mber clearly that ther e were Nazi soldiers on the streets of 
Madrid, and that Spain was -- under Franco wa
s cla -- a Nazi ally, and while not a war 
combatant, was certainly involved in helpi
ng the German war effort, and under German 
subservience. 

Q: So that must have been really weird, to be in
 this hotel with this huge
 portrait of Hitler. Did 
you know who this guy was?  
Did -- did anybody say? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
19 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You did. 

A: Yeah, yes I did. You know, I -- sure. 

Q: So you™re about si -- 

A: Six. 

Q: Six. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Six to seven, because you™re there -- okay, right, you™re not quite seven yet. 

A: No. Six and a half. 

Q: So you knew who he was? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So did it scare you? 

A: To a certain extent, I™ve retained a sense of a
dventure, and as I said, my
 recollection is not of 
being fearful, but rather of 
being curi -- sort of curious. 
Q: Right. 

A: And inquisitive. I was told th
at I asked more questions than 
I should have. On the other hand, 
I had the time, because I wasn™t going to school. 

Q: Right. And your sisters weren™t going to school. 

A: Correct. My sister Selma had gone to school -- 

Q: In Poland. 

A: In Poland -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- before the war broke out, 
but her educati
on also stopped. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
20 
 
 
Q: Right. So you™re in Madrid again for what
, three months -- July -- no, two months, couple 
months. 
A: We ll, right, six weeks. We  ended up -- and I --
 frankly I only have a vague recollection as to 
why we mo ved to Saville for awhile. I think it ma y have been economics. But we ended up -- my 

mother was continually trying to get transit 
on a ship bound -- leaving Spain for the United 
States. And we were finally able 
to get passage on a converted Span
ish coal freighter, called the 
Nava ma r. The small ship contained -- carried 15
00 refugees, probably all Jewish, in quadruple 
decker bunks. There was an open hole in the 
sleeping quarters because it had been a coal 
freighter and this hole was where they would du
mp the coal. And the ship left from what I 
believe was the port of San Sebastian, and set out for Havana and then New York. The -- because 

there was a lot of illness about th
e ship -- in fact, I was told that about si x pe ople had died in 
voyage, and that™s a voyage that t
ook almost six weeks, that my mo
ther was anxious to get us off 
the ship as quickly as possible. I recall that ther
e were live cattle aboard th
e ship, like four cows, 
because they didn™t ha ve  refrigeration, or adequa te 
refrigeration, and so in order to ha ve me at for 
the passengers, you had the cows. My mother was 
very appropriately concerned about the health 
of the water, so here I was, a 
six and a half year old kid, drin
king wine regularly, because it was 
deemed safe r than drinking the local water. Now -- 

Q: Did you like it? 

A: I don™t recall not liking it. 

Q: I see, okay. 

A: Now, the Spanish flagships were being used
 to get around the Bri
tish blockade, and the 

British were regular ly sinking Spanish fl agships. So there was a concer n as to what -- as to this 

possible danger. I think by the time  the ship got 
to Bermuda, or possibly cl
oser, we were boarded 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
21 
 
 
by the British Navy. I reme mber these officer
s in white uniforms boarding the ship, and 
satisfying themselves that this was a refugee sh
ip, and you know, not a tran
sport ship helping the 
German war effort. We  disembarked in Havana, a
nd in addition to the heal
th concerns, we didn™t 
have immi grant visas into the United States. When the Navamar returned back to Spain, it was 
converted back to being a coal freighter, a
nd was sunk by a British submarine on the next trip 
out. Yes, here we are in Cuba -- 

Q: Let me -- let me ask you something. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Since the Polish zloty is nothing any more
, what is your mother using for money, do you 
know?  

A: Okay, my father was a -- a -- was able to 
send funds to her through, I think was a Jewish 

network to hel -- which enabled money -- 

Q: I see. 
A: -- to be funneled, from the Unite
d States to, you know, Jews living -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- under Nazi control. 

Q: Right. So now you™re in Cuba
 with Nicaraguan citizenship. 
A: Correct. 

Q: Where do you go in Cuba?  You can™t get in
to the United States right away, right? 
A: Correct, well, we -- my recollect
ions of Cuba are not all that 
precise. I reme mber two things 
very clearly, that there were a 
lot of mosquitoes, and I reme mber my -- I can still picture my 
mother putting Calami ne lotion on me , and the other is
 that they had a lot of delicious ice cr eam.  
Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
22 
 
 
A: And it didn™t seem like an unpl
easant, you know, existence. It wa
s, of course, unusual to be in 
a sort of tropical island after 
having spent my previous years a
nd -- in Poland, and while we were 
there, having arrived in September of ™41, my  -- the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 
December, and that changed everyt hing. This point, it was much easier for my father to obtain 

immi grant status or visas for his fa mily to be
 reunited. And so in Ja
nuary, of ™42, we -- my 
fa mily boarded a ship called the Monterey, whic
h went from Cuba to Havana from -- to New 
York. Because there was a threat of German su
bmarines and we were now [indecipherable], I 
reme mber that there were like 13 passengers on th
e entire ship, and there were more crew than 
passengers. So that during the course of a meal, 
there™d be a waiter st an
ding behind every chair. 
So here we went from you know, a most -- 
you know, extreme harrowing experiences to what 
seemed like -- like the lap of luxury. 

Q: Right. 

A: And whe n we got to 
United States on January 23
rd
, 1942, it was such an extraordinary event 
that the New York World Telegram, then a prom
inent newspaper, featured a picture of my 
fa mily, and that is of my w -- of my mother 
and my sisters and myself
 having arrived, escaped, 
you know, Nazi tyranny. That was th
e first -- the last time for a l
ong time that my -- before my 
pictur e appeared in the paper again. 

Q: Again. When you were in Cuba, do you reme mb
er where you were sta -- staying?  Were you 
in a camp of some  kind for refugees, or no? 

A: No, we were in an apartment. 

Q: Hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
23 
 
 
A: It wasn™t a -- you know, lux-luxury apartm
ent, but we weren™t, you know, living in 
depravation. And I wish I could te
ll you how I spent my ti me . It certainly became  a lot -- I have a 
lot clearer picture what I was doingwhen I got to the United States. 
Q: Right. Now is your -- when -- your father 
was able to send for you because he™s now under 
immi grant status, or he™s already a citizen? 

A: No, no, he™s in immi grant stat
us. He had applied for citizenshi
p, but it requires five years of 
living in the United Stat es before -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- one can become  a citizen. 

Q: Right. And so he was able to get immi gran
t status for you -- for you and your mother and two 
sisters. 

A: Ri-Ri-Right. 

Q: Right. 
A: A-As -- as immi grant -- you know, as perman
ent status rather than a temporary visa. 
Q: Right. And is he living in New York? 
A: Yes. 

Q: He is. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So when you see him, is he -- is he some body you really reme mbered? 

A: Yea -- well, yes, and he had toys for us -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
24 
 
 
A: -- and was a [indecipherable] it was about -- 
perhaps 10 inch long mode l car that was green, 
was a police car and you could wind it up with a 
key and it would go and would ma ke a -- a siren 
sound. And you know, I just reme mb er being very excited. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, I can feel the exciteme nt of that January 23
rd
 day. 
Q: Right. And where does -- where is he liv
ing?  In s -- is he 
living in Brooklyn? 
A: He had been living, I think, in
 lower Manhattan in a hotel, but wh
en his fa mily arrived, he had 
acquired an apartment at 1035 Wa shington Avenue
 in Brooklyn, into the Flatbush section of 
Brooklyn, across the street from the Brooklyn Botani
c Garden. And that™s where he w -- he set 
up shop. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I think on his own, he bought furniture in 
a department store and had the place furnished 
and it was a four room apartment. I initially shar
ed a bedroom with my tw
o sisters, and I had a -- 
like a pull-out couch. A few years later we move d 
to a five room apartme nt in the same building, 
where I was able to get a -- my own bedr
oom and my two sisters shared a room. 

Q: Right. So is your dad stil
l doing the feather business? 
A: Yes. 

Q: In New York? 

A: Yes. 

Q: When do you, as a young person, become  consci
ous of what it was that you really went 
through in terms of the hist
 -- I mean, you -- you know what you went through, individual 
incidents or events, but you don™t necessarily 
know the history for a long time. So when does 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
25 
 
 
that become  really clear to you, that there was 
some thing called a Holocaust, and th-the Nazis 
were exterminating pe
ople, killing people? 
A: Let me backtrack just a little bit. 
Q: Sure. 

A: We  get to country in January of ™42. My -- 
I get s-sent to the loca
l public school, P.S. 241, 
and of course, reme mber, I -- 
I-I -- I™m not speaking English. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I was desperate to become  an American, a
nd so I willed myself to forget Polish, if you 
can [indecipherable] grasp that concept. And so th
at summer we were sent  to a -- a sl eep-away 
camp called unserkamp inkindervelt. I would say 
that it was the extreme left wing of Jewish 
Socialism. I laugh when I think back on that. Th
e following September, I was sent to the Crown 
Heights Yeshiva, and my two sisters stayed at 
P.S. 241, and were given piano lessons; it seemed 
appropriate for girls. They hated 
piano lessons, I hated the Yeshiva. 
Q: You couldn™t switch. 

A: No, I-I wasn™t gi ven the choice, and so here 
I was taking three and a ha lf hours of Hebrew in 
the morning and four hours of English in th
e afternoon and somehow 
I was trying to learn 
English the same time. I can™t tell
 you how it worked out, but it did. 
Q: Why did they send you to Yeshiva, do you think? 

A: Because that™s what boys did. 

Q: I see. Your father had gone to Yeshiva when he was a boy? 

A: He went to Johaida. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: You know, I -- more of a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
26 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- religious school.  

Q: Right. Did you tell your
 parents you hated it? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And wha t ™d they say, it™s too bad? 

A: Well, I had this checkered past  where in the 
third grade I switched for one seme ster to P.S. 
241, and then I went back to the Yeshiva. And 
then I should -- reme mber you asked me about 
my recognition of the war, and it has -- two thi
ngs come  to my  mi nd. One is that we were big 
Roosevelt fans. Back -- I even reme mber in 1944 
that when he ran for re
-election, the Roosevelt 
cavalcade went right up Washi
ngton Avenue where we lived. Bu
t the Hebrew teachers thought 
that Roosevelt was an anti-Semite because he didn™t allow more Jews into the United States. So 

we had this feeling -- this sense, you know, that 
bad things were happening to Jews there. The 
other thing that you asked, when did I really 
get the recognition of th
is?  I reme mber comi ng 
home  from c a mp in August of ™45, and my fa
ther was sitting on a camp trunk and crying because 

he had just gotten a telegram th
at his parents had died during th
e war. Then in ™46, my  Uncle 
Nor man showed up, together with his brother Ma
urice, and while Mauric
e went back to Italy, 
Nor man stayed in the United States, got hims elf 
a little tan Ol dsmobile convertible wi -with red 
leather seats and I thought he was real cool. By 
that time  he was speaking Italian and I think he 
kind of, you know, had the glow
 of It-Italian chic. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I was turning aware that most of
 my fa mily had not 
survived the war. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh-what did that do to you, do you think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
27 
 
 
A: I think it certainly gave me  a -- a sense of 
identity, you know, of being -- of being Jewish, of 
being very supportive of Israel. And I reme mber, 
I guess, that Nove mber ™47 vote in the U.N. on 
-- on partition of Palestine as th --
 as something very specific. It was --  it was a histor ic event that 
I can say I have a contemporaneous recollection. 
Q: Right. And you were 12. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes. We  need to change the ta
pe. Do you want to really get up now? 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
28 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: So you -- you were saying that you have a vivi
d recollection of the 1947 
-- the vote to form a 
state of Israel. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you then, as you get a bit older, you™re then
 12, in your teenage y
ears or in your early 
20™s, do you start reading about th
e Holocaust?  Or is -- 
does that come  later? Or do you not even 
feel the need to because you went through it in some  way? 

A: Because so ma ny me mbers of my  fa mily perished
 in the Holocaust, I™d have to read about it. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I mean, I was on the periphery of it, and did so
rt of reinforce this. My mother had a sister 
Dora, who ma rried a Dutchman by the name  of Jo
el Grajower, that ™s G-r-a-j-o-w-e-r, and lived 
in The Hague. Dora did not survive the war, but 
Joel and their four children, who had been in 
what ha -- what -- I think been in the Caribbean 
during the war, came -- visited us in new -- i-in 
Brooklyn in 1946, and lived with us actually, fo
r a few months. And they ma de us very 
conscious of the fact that they were displaced pe
rsons, so to speak. And so we were -- we were 
living that. We -- we were livi
ng the detrious of th
e Holocaust. We  have 
to read about it. 
Q: And your Uncle Norman, did he talk 
about his experiences when he came?  
A: Y-Yes -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- I mean, you know, that he -- I 
heard his experiences in detail
, but it™s been over the years, 
so it™s hard for me to just say this. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
29 
 
 
A: But certainly, I mean, I reme mber him telling me
 that at one point he
 and his older brother 
Maurice were on one of these death ma rches wh
en they were moved from one concentration 
camp to another. And that when somebody woul
d drop from exhaustion, they were presumed 
dead, and their bodies would be th
rown on the back of a truck and then buried, you know, in due 
course. And so my Uncle Maurice fell down, was 
thrown on the back of a truck and then his 
younger, mo re rigorous brother Norman literally
 took him down from the  death truck, you know, 
and revived him. And you know, that
™s about as bad as it gets. 
Q: Right. Do you recall anti-Germa n 
-- I don™t know whether to call it
 propaganda or -- ways in 
which the United States portrayed the German
s once -- once you came he re
, and then after the 
war, was there a -- a lot of talk about how
 horrible the Nazis were, or other people? 
A: We ll, within the Jewish world, where -- wh
ich was where I basically lived, you couldn™t say 
nu -- bad things about 
the Nazis often enough. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And there was just this feeling that this was 
the greatest calamity that had ever befallen the 
Jewish people in our 3200 years 
of history, and that it was shoc
king that cultured Europeans, and 
the Germans, who are certainly viewed as being 
in that category, could act in such a bestial 
ma nner. 
Q: When did you start reading English ne
wspapers, do you reme mber?  Or American 
newspapers. 

A: Early on. See, I was, let™s say I 
was gung ho to become  an American -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and one of the consequences
 of my experience th -- is 
that I was and still am a gung ho 
American. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
30 
 
 
Q: So does that mean you read papers as soon as you could read? 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: And how long did it take you to learn Englis
h?  You were seve -- seven when you came here -
- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- about seven, yes. 

A: Well let me say, I reme mber very clearly fo
llowing the progress of the war, 19 -- you know, 
™44. 

Q: You did, uh-huh. 

A: Oh yeah, and D-Day was another da
y that I -- so I re -- reme mber. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so that™s -- sure, I was 
reading the paper, you know, we used
 to get the ﬁNew York Post.ﬂ 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And was by -- by that time I was -- I must have
 picked up the language quickly. I think that 
kids are much more facile at doing that than 
trying to pick up a la
nguage at a later age. 
Q: Right. Did your mother speak English? 
A: She had to learn it. 

Q: Yes, and your dad as well, of c
ourse, because he was doing business. 
A: Yes. Of c ourse he had been in this 
country for a few more years than we had. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But he always retained quite a he avy fore
ign accent, whereas my -- my mother had not -- 
spoke English without any noticeable accent. 

Q: Really?  Interesting. It
 must have been great 
to be a family again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
31 
 
 
A: It wa -- it was. 
Q: Yeah. Was there a conflict when you were in 
the Yeshiva and hearing about what happened to 
the Jews, and then in the newspapers you™re read
ing primarily about the wa r, which is not about 
death camps and labor camps and all the horrors
 that the Nazis committed against Jews a-and 
other people. Wa s there a conflic
t in you about what™s going on? 
A: Yes, because I thought that my teachers, who 
-- at the Yeshiva, several of whom were rabbis, 
were being too critical of my 
adopted country that I loved. And 
that they weren™t looking at it 
from the American point of view. 

Q: You were very conscious of that. 

A: I wa -- yes. 

Q: That™s interesting. Did you come  home  and talk
 about it with your parents, what you were -- 
what you were hearing, 
what was bothering you? 
A: I talked about it to
 -- to my sisters. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I mean, it™s interesting, when -- when you ask 
me  this question, you really have turned the 
clock back ma ny, many years.  

Q: So you -- that you reme mber?   

A: I reme mb er discussing with my sisters -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- who were going to public school -- 

Q: Public school, right. 

A: -- and who didn™t ha ve  these teachers who ha
d -- who were thinking lik
e old Europeans -- Old 
World Europeans. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
32 
 
 
Q: Right. So did that ma ke you want 
to go to the public school even more? 
A: Yes. I™m -- I have to tell you, actu -- duringthe morning three and a half hours of Hebrew, I 
was not a very good student, and I wa s a very badly behaved, throwing spitballs at the teacher, 

having my face slapped, being sent  down to th
e pr incipal™s office, having my knuckles rapped 
with a ruler. To a -- this wa
s a different world. And in English from the get go, I was an A 
student and with -- with a A in conduct. So I -- 

Q: They mu st have thought
 you were schizophrenic. 
A: Well, th-they had a point. I had certainly -- 
was fighting between my -- the American identity 
that I wanted to totally absorb. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my Jewish heritage. 

Q: Right. So how long did you go to Yeshiva? 

A: I stopped wa -- going there in my
 last year of grade school. So
 I finished -- I was -- I think I 
was -- just  after I -- I was Bar Mitzvah™d in late
 March, and that June wa
s probably my last year 
in the Yeshiva. And then I finished at P.S. 241. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And went on to -- for the next 
two years to Erasmus Moore High School. 
Q: Two years, you did high school in two years? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, I tell you. After two years, I switched 
to the Horace Mann School up in the Riverdale 
section of the Bronx, where I was one of the few boarding students. 

Q: Huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
33 
 
 
A: I was able to come  home  weekends, but I think that
 in part I was sort of glad to have a bit of a 
different environment. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Those two years at Horace Ma nn ma de quite a lasting impression on me. 

Q: What was the biggest impression, you think? 

A: That I was now thinking of myself as being 
more pli -- more privilege
d, more worldly, more 
obligated to the society of which I was a part. Mo
re comfortable in different social environments. 

A quote, real American. 

Q: Right. And you were grow -- 
you were really growing up. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And from hor -- Horace Mann you went to -- 
A: Columbia College. 
Q: Right. A-And what was your ma jor in Columbia? 

A: I started actually doing engineering, and I took
 the engineering sequen
ce of -- of advanced 
physics and chemistry and mechanic
al drawing. And especially the 
last one, I -- I really didn™t 
like. And I finished college in three years, and I was thinking about
 -- by that time my father had 
entered to the upstream, or growing ec -- e
nd -- production end of th
e [indecipherable] gas 
business. And this was a business that appealed
 to me  as opposed to 
the feather and down 
business, or it™s a -- it™s sequence, the foa m rubbe
r business, which he had been in. And so I was 
thinking about going to get a Master
™s degree in petroleum engineer
ing at the Carlotta School of 
Mines, or some place like that. However, I decided th
at this wasn™t for me, and so kind of the last 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

mi nute I took the LSATs law school aptitude te
st, you know, did exceptiona
lly well, applied to 
Harvard and got in and there I was, you know, 
going to Harvard Law School, and knowing that I 
was looking to a business career rath
er than a career in the law. 
Q: In the law, uh-huh. 
A: But I was always glad to have had the benefi
ts of the law school educ
ation without having the 
acute anxi eties that many of my classmates ha
d, because their standing in
 the class could very 
well determine the career tr
ack that they would be on. 
Q: Right, right. And were your pa
rents very influential in term
s of sugge sting that you do one 
thing rather than another, or were
 you quite independent by this time? 
A: We ll, I™ll tell you, my  sister Selma had a major influence on me , both in terms of going to 

Horace Mann, because she had also had some  cat
ching up to do school-wise, havi ng not gone to 

school for several years. 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So rather than going to Erasmus Hall, the 
local public high school, she went to the Rhodes 
school in Manhattan and got out in three years, an
d so this is my -- my model of going elsewh -- 
going off the standard path -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and -- and going at your own tempo. 

Q: Right. So that™s really important. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So when you graduated, when you got your 
law degree, did you go into your dad™s oil 
business, or did you go out on your own? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
35 
 
 
A: Okay, I did some thing wh-which has always
 brought me  a lot of pleasure to think about. 
Having been 23, I took off a half a year and traveled around the world. And I went to pl aces 

which are c-certainly out of bounds to tourists, 
pa rticularly American tourists. Places like 
Kashmi r in Nepal, and Bali. And I 
had a lot of wonderful me mories of
 that trip. One of the things 
that happened as -- July 14
th
, 1958, there was a revolution in Ira
q, and I was in India, and my 
parents said come home, come home . And I sa
id no way. And actually I 
went from India to 
Cairo, you know, and -- you know, people 
don™t sort of realize 
that India isn™t that far from that 
part of the world. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I -- I have to tell you a story which I 
kind of enjoy, and that is that I took 2000 
Kodachrome slides during the course of this trip
, and when I me t my wife  the following year, in 
™59, and I told her about my slides
, she said, ﬁI™d love to see them
.ﬂ So I s a id to her, ﬁWell I™m -- 
I™d love to show them to you, would you like to 
move in with me  for three weeks? ﬂ She said, 
ﬁ What is this?  What kind of a girl do you thi
nk I am? ﬂ  Obviously the alternative was to pro-
propose ma rriage, which I did. 

Q: When -- how long did you know her before you 
proposed that she mo ve in for three weeks? 
A: Se -- a few months. 

Q: A few months. 

A: But I knew -- I knew that it -- th-that was not
 a serious -- a -- a question because obviously I 
knew her answer. 

Q: I see. 

A: It was just a way of -- 

Q: Right, right, you were just -- I see -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
36 
 
 
A: -- have -- play -- playing the game . 
Q: Did you fall in love right aw
ay?  Was it pretty fast for you? 
A: I would say that I was attract
ed to her right away. I -- let me
 say, I was living in Manhattan by 
that time, and she was living in Lawr ence, Long 
Island, which ma de her what -- what we would 
refer to as G.U., geographically undesirable. 

Q: Right. 

A: So rather -- she was working in Manhattan -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- for CBS classical records. We  had a love 
of music in common, and so rather than asking 
her out for Sa turday night, which me ant driving 
to Lawrence, comi ng back to the city and then 
driving out to Lawrence again, I would only ask 
her out during the week, because this way I 
could meet her after work. 

Q: Right. 
A: And she was wondering whether -- what my leve
l of interest was, since I wasn™t asking her 
out Saturday nights. 
Q: Right. 

A: I had me t her the previous August. By the tim
e the spring came , she we nt to an extended trip 
to Europe with her fami l y, and when she came back, she was wearing mu ch brighter colored 

clothing, and I found that very at
tractive, and so I said to he
r, I said, ﬁYou know, I like -- you 
look so well in these colors.ﬂ And she said, ﬁW
ell, you know I used to deliberately wear dark 
colors because you™re -- you™re a Harv
ard ma n.ﬂ I assured her that -- 
Q: That you weren't -- 

A: -- my -- my education and my taste 
in clothes, had nothing in common. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
37 
 
 
Q: -- weren't -- weren™t -- right. And so I unde
rstand that you -- you got 
ma rried a -- a year 
before your mother passed away, so 
she was able to be at your wedding. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So that was good. 

A: We got married December third, 1960. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my mother passed 
away December fifth of ™61. 
Q: Right.  

A: And my wife, to her everlasti
ng credit, moved in with me into my father™s apartment because 
he was truly devastated at my mothe r™s early 
and unexpected death. She died from -- she did not 
recover from an operation to remove a benign 
tumor near her brain, an
d whether it was an 
avoidable matter, bec -- or whether because she 
got ex -- excessive anes
 -- anesthetics, or 
whether it was unavoidable,
 we can never be sure. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: But the consequences were there. 

Q: Right. 

A: And wha t  ma de it so singularly unfortunate is
 that we had just moved to Manhattan a few 
years ago, and -- I mean her. She was opening --
 she was beginning a new phase in her life -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- just when it ended. 

Q: Right. Did your father rema rry? 

A: Yes. 

Q: He did. A number of y
ears later, I -- or  in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
38 
 
 
A: Three or four years later. 
Q: Uh-huh. And were you close with her or not? 

A: Oh, with his second wife? 

Q: The second wife. 

A: I would say we were cordial but not close. 

Q: Not close. 

A: And we still ma intain very 
cordial relationship, I spoke to 
her on the phone a day or two ago. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, but she has her children and my father has -- 

Q: His. 

A: -- had had his. 

Q: Had his, right. 

 A: And as I think I me ntioned to you, I -- despit
e the fact that both my sisters have passed away, 
we keep in close cont act with my nieces and nephews. 

Q: Right. And I understand you™d like to be able 
to say some thing as we -- as we close the 
interview, so I want to give you an opportuni
ty to say what it is that you want to say. 
A: We ll, my  two older grandsons, Ge orge and A
ndrew Malkin are wonder
ful boys. They live in 
Greenwich with their parents, and go to Gr
eenwich Country Day, a school that is over -- 
overwhelmingly non-Jewish. My old -- oldest 
grandson George wrot
e a paper about my 
European experiences and backgr
ound. He asked me  to appear 
before his history class to 

[indecipherable] my -- my expe
riences. And at this pointhis younger brother Andrew is 
expecting me in a few weeks, and anxiously
 looking forward to sharing my European 
background experiences with his classmates, and I 
feel that their intere
st in my background is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
39 
 
 
some thing that I would like to share not only 
with them, but with my other three living 
grandchildren, and hopefully more grandchildrenthat come  down the pike, and possibly even 

their children. I™m appreciativ
e of having this opportunity. 
Q: What is it you really want them to know, do you think? 

A: I want them to know that -- how
 fortunate they are to be living 
in this country, to be living in 
a comfortable environment, to r
ecognize that being Jewish isa privilege and a burden. It is 
some thing that you can retain in 
your heart almost separate and 
apart from wh-whatever rituals 
you practice or don™t practice. That it
 also represents a caring of fa m
ily, of loyalty to each other, 
of the ability to handle a
dversity. So I think that there™s a -- mu
ch to be learned from what others 
went through, to hope that you don™t have adve
rsity, but that when you do, well we all have 
bumps in our road, you keep a sense of perspective. 

Q: And the Holocaust acts as a way of k
eeping a sense of perspective, you think? 
A: Certainly the Holocaust as an 
abstract concept is hard to tr
ansmit. But when you realize that 
you come  from a fa mily that had actively, even at 
-- to an extent periphera
lly participated in the 
Holocaust, it gives you an -- a sense of -- of 
i mmediacy, and intimacy, which you can™t otherwise 
get. 

Q: Is there anything else you™d 
like to say about your life? 
A: While bad things have happened to me  ove
rall, I™m an extraordinary lucky person and 
appreciative as I said of this 
opportunity to share part of my 
history with my fa mily and anybody 
else who is interested. 

Q: We ll, thank you very much for giving of your time. 

A: Thank you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506

Q: Thank you. All right, now we™re going to do 
the photographs, so you can™t leave. You can 
leave and find out what™s going on in your office, but you have to come  back.

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay, and what is this [indecipherable] I 
mean, Robert, I keep calling you [indecipherable]. 
Robert, what is this? 
A: This is a picture of my parents, Ar thur and 
Rochelle Belfer, and my older sister Selma in the 
mi ddle, and to her right is my other sister Anita
.And on my father™s lap 
is a picture of myself. 
Judging by the age of the children, I 
would say that this was taken 
in the summer of 1939 at the 
resort of Ropka in the Ca rpathian mountains 
of southern Poland. – Let me ask you, since I™ve 
already identified the players, I ca
n go a lot faster [indecipherable] 
Q: Go ahead. Okay, whenever you™re rea
dy. Robert, what is this picture of? 
A: It is the picture of my  pare
nts and my sisters, Selma and Anita
, with me  sitting between them, 
and it was probably taken in the 
resort of Ropka in southern Poland in late summer of 1939. 
Q: Okay, and Robert, what is this? 

A: This is a picture of myself at probably th
e age of about four, and 
I would guess that it was 
taken during the summer  of 1939, and I look very happy sitting on a horse. 

Q: Is this after your hair was cut? 

A: No, I still -- I think that my hair -- no, my
 hair wasn™t cut until after the war broke out. 
Q: Uh-huh. Okay, and who is this? 

A: This is a picture of my sister Selma, who is
 probably about seven and a half at the time, and 
her younger sister Hanka, or Anita, who was five and 
a half, aboard horses. 
I suspect this was the 
summer of 1939. 

Q: And which one is Selma?  

A: Selma is the one on the right, the o-older on
e. Notice they are both we
aring these big bows in 
their hair. I imagine that that was 
the in style in Poland at the time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
42 
 
 
Q: Okay [indecipherable] these. 
A: This is a picture of my parents, Ar thur a
nd Rochelle Belfer, taken in Poland. It was probably 
taken in 1939, shortly before my father left for 
the United States, never to return to Poland again. 
Do I need to me ntion my  name , or do I se -- just say it™s me? 

Q: You can say it™s you. Are we ready?  Yes. Okay. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Who is this? 

A: It is a picture of Bob Belfer
 at his high school graduation. You ma
y notice that my hair is a lot 
shorter and a lot darker than 
it was in the previous pictur
es that you™ve seen of me . 
Q: This is high school? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And who  is that? 

A: This is a photograph of my 
father, Arthur Belfer, taken 
about 1990, or about three years 
before he passed away. He is looking very di
stinguished to me , and 
clearly a man of great 
wisdom.  

Q: Okay, and who is this? 

A: This is a photograph of my mo
ther, Rochelle Anisfeld Belfer, 
taken probably when she was in 
her late 40™s or early 50™s, in the United Stat
es. It was a black and wh
ite photograph that was 
subsequently colored in to accurately reflect he
r coloring. She looks rather glamorous there, and 
it™s my pleasure to see her pretty face. 

Q: And wha  -- who are these people? 

A: This -- this photograph 
is of my darling wife René and myse
lf. I suspect it was taken about 10 
years ago, which would ma ke it 1996. I would say th
at René has aged very little since then. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
43 
 
 
Q: These folks? 
A: This is a photograph of René 
and myself in formal attire. I think René looks lovely, as she 
always does. We ™ve now been ma rried for over 45 y
ears, and it was certainly one of -- the very 
best move of my life. 

Q: And who are these folks? 

A: This is a photograph of my wi
fe René, to the right, and in 
-- sitting in the mi ddle is my 
younger daughter Elizabeth. Behind her is my son 
Lawrence and his bride Ca
roline. This picture 
was taken, I would guess, about si
x years ago, and I can 
tell you that everybody 
looks at least as 
well now as they do in that picture, 
with the possible exception of myself. 
Q: And who are these folks? 

A: This is a photo of my  son-in-law, Tony Malki
n, my daughter, and his --
 and his wife , Shelly, 
and their two boys, Arthur and Andrew. The picture was taken when they were probably about 

11 and nine years old. They™re a wonderfulfami ly and I love them each dearly.  
Q: Okay, and who are these? 
A: This is a picture of my cousin Hanka Anis
feld Wyvell, and her husband court -- Dr. Curt 
Wyvell. He was an orthopedist who accompanied 
the Israeli Ol ympic team to Munich in 1972, a 
horrifying experience for him and a
nybody else who thinks about it.  
Q: And who  is this? 

A: This is a photograph of [ind
ecipherable] God, the Israeli vers
ion of Avram Anisfel d, the son 
of my mother™s brother,and th
erefore my cousin, in his Israel
i army uniform. He subsequently 
became Israel™s ambassador to Argentina.  

Q: Okay, and who are these folks? 

A: Okay, this is a photograph that I treasure, show
ing four generations. My father Arthur, my son 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
44 
 
 
Lawrence in the mi ddle, and my olde r daughter™s
 son, Tony -- I™m sorry, older daughter Shelly 
and Tony™s son, George Malkin when
 he was about one year old. And it is extraordinary that -- 
I™m sorry -- can I -- can I take that from the top? 
Q: How old is he now? 

A: George is now going on 16, and of course I™m in
 this picture also, and 
beaming with pride at 
having been associated with so ma ny wonderful people. 

Q: You™re really good at this. Okay, this is a lo
t of people here. All right
, what are we looking at 
now?  

A: Okay. I love this wedding photograph of my s
on Lawrence, who is on my left. Beneath him is 
his beautiful bride Caroline. Next 
to her is my delightful wife, René
. I™m sitting next to her, and 
on my left is my older daughter Sh
elly. And to her left is my y
ounger daughter Liz. In front of 
her, sitting, is my six foot four inch son-in-law
, Tony Malkin, and the -- the two little boys in the 
foreground are George and Andrew
 Malkin, and I would guess fr
om the photograph they were 
about five and three years ol
d. It™s a delicious photogra
ph of my beautiful fa mily. 
Q: All right, one more. And 
here, you know, if you don™t -- okay. 
And what are we looking at 
now, Robert? 

A: This is a photograph of two of
 my grandsons, George and Andr
ew Malkin, and eight of their 
cousins who I will not identify by name. What they
 all ha ve in common is that they ar e all 
grandchildren of this -- of Arthur and Rochelle Be
lfer, and the -- with -- he
re we are together for 
a Passover Se der, and it is always a source of grea
t joy and pride that our fa mily stays so close 

together. 

Q: Okay, the two gentleme n on the photograph. 

A: The -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506  
45 
 
 
Q: Who are these [indecipherable] 
A: Okay. These are -- my younger two grandsons ar
e Arthur and Daniel Belfer. If they look 
devilish, it™s an accurate representation of their pe rsonalities. They 
are lots of fun to have around. 
Q: Very good. Okay, who is this? 

A: After four grandsons, my blue eyed prince
ss, Abigail, daughter of my son Lawrence and 
Caroline, arrived. She imme diatel
y wrapped her older brothers a
nd the rest of her fa mily around 
her finger. 

Q: And how old is she now? 

A: She is now three and a half
, and as delicious as ever. 
Q: Very good.
