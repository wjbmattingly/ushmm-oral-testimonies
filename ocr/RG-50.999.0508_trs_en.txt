[Applause]
 
Nat, thank you som uch f or joining us and your wil lingness to be our First Persontoday. It's wonderful 

to see yourf am ily ri ght here in thef ront row. W e're going to startbecause youhave som uch to share 

with us, and we have just an hour. You werenot yet 3 when Germ any invaded Poland 
i n Se p tem be r  

1939, startingW orldWar II. Butbefore we turn tothe war years andparticularly as it affected your 

comm unity, let's start first with you telling us a little bitabout yourfamily and your com munity before 

the war began. 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: B o
thmy parents com ef rom  sm all villages in eastern of  Hungary, which is called 
T ransylvania at thattim e. My m other was the oldest of 12 children, and m y f ather was the youngest of  

six. A little later on, in1924, afterf irst world war, m y f ather and two of
 
hisbrothers imm igrated to 
Rom ania,opened abig farm , dairy f arm toprovide products to theRom anianArmy. 
 
T hen in 1930, m yf ather went back to getm arried.T he twof am ilies knew each other, because both 
grandparents, their parents, were in the cattle trade, and they knew eachotherf rom  the different 

trading. So it was natural f or them  to get married within thef am ily. 
 
So in1930,m y fathercam e back to Romania with a young bride, and before long they hadthree 
children, two girls and a boy, and I'm  th
e boy. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas lif e like in thedairy f arm for you asa youngster? 
 
>>
 
Nat Shaff ir: A normal life, different choresto do. Norm ally, it was not really excitin g.W edidn't 
have any television, no iPhones, iPadsor anything like that. Butpretty much we stayed home and we 

hadhom e schooling. That's pretty m uch what lif e was all about, very sim ple. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was the Jewish comm unity? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  T here was approxim ately 25 different f am ilies in that f arm com munity, so different 
people haddiff erentfarms. Some were traders of  different products,but generally about 25different 

J e wis h  f am ilie s .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So a sm all comm unity.W hatwere relationships likewith the non
-
Jewish population? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: My f ather lived thereapproxi m ately 20 years. He dealt with the gentilefarm ers. He 

helped them  a lot when things were badf or them, crops were shortor certainthings. Healwa ys tried 

to help. He never said no to anyone in this entire area. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W as your family religious? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Ye s, the y we re . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned
 
tom e that, you mentioned am oment ago, there were no iPads, 
things like that. Infact,there was no electricity.

>> Na t S h aff ir: Co rre ct. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa very sim ple, rural life that you were living at that tim e? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Righ t. 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Nat, you m entionedalso that you had three different birth dates.W hy was that? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Actually, two, yeah. I'll tell you what happened. My daughtersare laughing.W hen we 
lived f urther away f rom the m ain city, m y m other gave birth at hom e. By the tim em y father got a 

chance to go tothe big city to register us, took some tim e, somem onths, sometim es two months, so 

at thatpoint they registered based on the date maybe that he cam e, butmy birth date was actually 

December 26, 1936. Itwas registered as Decem ber 28, 1938. And Ithink it was only one December 

28,1936. Evenm y m other never had it together exactly what was the date. So that's what happened. 
 
So one tim e, we didn't know exactl y what's going on, so I sentaway t o the Roma
nian embassy f or 

birth certif icate. Finally cam e back,m y birth date was Decem ber 26, 1936. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's when you celebrate? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hat's when you celebrate. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nat, althoughW orldW arII began with Germ any and Russia
 
attacking Poland in 
September 1939, it wasn't until 1941 that thelives of  yourf am ily and other Jews in your com munity 

near the city of  Iasi changed dramatically. T ell us aboutthat period,what you can,about that period 

between the start of the war in September 1939 and whenthings really changed dram atically in 1941, 

then later in 1942. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: As Bill m entioned, we didn't have radios, television, we didn't know m uchwhat's going 

on. Som ehow, little things trickled intothef arm  area thatthere's a war going on in Poland,andthe 

Russians joined theGerm ans. Little by little,we f oundout af ter 1940 people arebeing killed,people 

are being sentaway. W hat we had in Rom ania, inIasi inparticular, in July of  1941, was abig pogrom  

where 10,000
 
Jews were roundedupand killed.T hat was theextentwe knew e xactly what's going on 
in the war to this point, that people are killing Jews. For no reason, just because they're Jewish. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou toldm e that evenbef ore the war, in 1938, the governm ent becam em ore 

anti
-
Sem itic in Rom ania. So there are changes already happening, things got lessf riendly thanthey 
had been for you as a youngster. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Romania was a m onarchy. I don't know if  you knew that.It was am onarchy, then the 

general in the Iron Guard Arm y tookover.W as a very anti
-
Sem itic individual. He hated anybody, but 
particularly Jews. So Jews were alwa ys lo w c itizen, or the lowest class of  his government.T here was 

no Jewish people in his governm ent. Jews were treated differently than the gentiles were treated. So 

through the years, later until 1945, he handled everything that's going on in Romaniaat that time. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the early years of  the war, butbefore things got really awf ul in Rom ania, was yo
u r 

father and hisbrothers, were they able to continuetooperate thefarm  asthey had? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Until 1941, yes. There were problem sf rom  time to tim e. I remem ber one particular 

problem . My father hired som e people todom anual work, actually hir
ed one, two people, and about 
four of them showed up. My father told the individual thathehired,he said, Ionly hired two of  you. 

T he guy hadanaxe inhis hand. He said, How m any did you hire?

He said, Four of you. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the fall of 1942, yourf am ily and other Jews f rom Buchum  were abruptly forced to 
pick upand move to Iasi. T ellus how that happened.Tell us what happenedthere. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W henwe lived in Buchum one of our neighbors was a priest. Every week he would 

com e by and
 
askfor donationsfor the church, some dairy productsfor some of his  congregants who 
couldn't afford.In20 years,m y f athernever ref used once. One day, 1942, the same priestshows up 

with a policeman, apolice off icer,and two arm ed guards arm ed.W hen
 
we saw him approaching the 
house, we all cam eout to greethim . Once hecam e close, he turnedto the officer andpointed at us 

and said,These are Jews. He used the wordfor a Jew. Theoff icer told m y father andm other that we 

have f our hours to vacate th
efarm, and they're going to take ustoa place, relocated closeto the 

large city of  Iasi. In the four hours, we're allowed to take one horse
-
drawn wa gon to take whatever we 
can carry or can load in f our hours. Keep inm ind, it was Novem ber, som y mother realized, though 

m y f athertried to convince him  perhaps he canf orget theorder. My father said,Look, I've known you 

since you were born.I've known your f am ily over 20 years.  Can't you do something about it,f orget 

about the situation? 
 
He says, T he reasonthathe gotthef our hours is because you know m e, you know m y fam ily. 

Otherwise, you wouldn't have gottenf our hours. 
 
My m other realized there's no way to convince him not to take usawa y. She orderedall three of us 
into thehouse and told us to put on asm any clothesas possible.I rem ember putting on two pairs of 
pants, two shirts, socks, and I rem em ber that a small wagon with one horse is not a lot. My m other 

was able totake blankets, som e pillows, thecash she had in the house,her jewelry, som e potsand 

pans, cooking utensils. Then we were escorted tothe ghetto of Iasi. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned, Nat, that this priest was also with som ebody f rom the Iron Guard. 

W ill youexplain touswhat the Iron Guard was? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T heIron Guard was fascists. It was run very 
--
 
ver y close to Mussolini. T hey hated 
Jews. Very anti
-
Sem itic. They actually did later on 
through the war did a dirty job, a dirty war f or the 
Nazis, becauseGermany or the Nazis did notoccupy Romaniaper se, but the Iron Guarddid their 

d i rt y work .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were young at that time.But you rem em ber theday you were f orced to leav
e 
your home soabruptly. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yes, Ido. Goingf rom  Buchum  all the way to Iasi, riding on the wagon, it'sver y clear 
to  m e . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described tom e whenIf irst talkedto youabout it that you rem em ber, just the 
raw em otions everybody had, the fear, all of  those things. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yes. First, we didn't know where we're going. Didn't know all we had was the clothes 
that we cam e with. And a little bitm y m otherput in the wagon. Everything else we had to leave 

behind. 
 
>> B i l
l Benson: W here did they take you? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T o a closer city, Iasi. Iasi isabig city at thatpoint. Had a populationof  50,000 Jews. 

Iasi was situated, the way it was situated was courtyards. Each courtyard has a certainnum berof

houses. T hey 
took these housesand dividedeach individual room f rom thehouse given toone 
fam ily.W e received one room forf ive of  us.The only thing we had in that room  was two beds. No 
closet,nonothing in there. One bedm y m other and two sisters sleeping, the next bedm y fatherand I 

were sleeping there. Once arrived tothe ghetto, number one, they took your nam edown. You hadto 

be registeredto receive ration cards. They weref orbread, kerosenef or heating and cooking. Once in 

the ghetto youhad todo certain things thatnorm ally we were not used todobefore. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthey came to get you, the authorities createdthis already? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T he ghetto was createdbefore us.Probably within the last six m onths. People would 

start to accum ulatedifferentfarm sor different little small towns, smaller cities. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your extendedfam ily go with you? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: No,m y extendedfam ily stayed in Hungary, all m y gr andparents,m y uncles, aunts. 

T here were three of them  
--
 
33  t ha t  
rem ainsback in Hungary at that tim e. Later I'll tell you what 
happened to them . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,I think, operated thedairy f arm  with two brothers. 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Co rre ct. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ere they with you? 
 
>> Na t  S h af f ir:  No t  in 
--
 
in the ghetto, but different areas.T here were 400 ghettos. Some ghettos 
were closed, som e were open.W e were in the open ghetto, which m eans we had a certain am ountof  

space we were allowed to walk around.W e had to wear our yellow s tar declaring usas J
ew. The two 
uncles youm entioned were in the different part of  the streets.W edidn't see them . Once in a while m y 

father saw them , because they were having differentm anual jobs perform ingforthe iron guards and 

the authorities. So they see each other f r
om  tim e to  tim e . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though you were in so
-
called open ghetto, you could notf reely m ove to where 
they were because they were in a separate open ghetto? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hat's correct.W e hadapproxim ately 12 blocks tom ove around.T hings had to go,for 

instance,for the breadwas outside the ghetto. To get the kerosene,outside the ghetto.W e couldnot 

leave the ghettobefore 5:00 a.m . and thenonly f or different reasons. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'll take you back a littlebit.You m entioned
 
the pogrom  that took place in 1941. Can 
you tell us m ore about that? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: In July 1941, there were two trains loaded with Jewis h people,f erriedf rom Iasi to 
another town approximately 150m ilesaway. For threedays, going back andforth, without any 

reason. Nofood or water. By the tim ethey cam eback to Iasi and opened the trains, half  ofthepeople 

were dead.Inaddition to that,at the same time, in July 30, 10,000 people were killed by axes, guns, 

clubs, just because they were Jewish. 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: T hatwas before they began creating the ghettos andm oving you into the ghettos? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Ye s. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem ained in the Socola ghetto until 1945 whenIasi was liberated. Tellus what 

lif e was like in the ghetto you describeda little about.

>> Nat Shaff ir: Since I m entionedthe ration cards, we have to gotothe bakery, to the kerosene 
station.T he ration card was a booklet.T herewere pages for kerosene,pages for bread. Also pages 

for butter andoil, but we never saw
 
these rations because the indivi duals responsiblef orthe rations 
sold those things to the black m arket. 
 
T o stay in line,to gooutsideto stay in line toget thebread,for instance, we were allowed 1/4 loaf of  
breadfor every two days per person in our
 
f am ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  A quarter loaf of bread, every two days? 
 
>>
 
Nat Shaff ir: My f ather sentm e to stay in line, because he didn'twant to sendm y oldersister, 
because there'sa lotof hooligans picking onJewish gi rls. Here I'm approxim ately 8 years old. He 
sentm eout to get all the breadand the kerosene. That's pretty much what happened. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that whenhedidn't want to send your sister out, you would goout,and 

you did get into som escuffles,as you put it. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yes, Idid. I came hom em any tim es with a bloody nose. I tried 
to f ight back a little bit, 

but we couldn'tbecause they were gangin g up on one individual.Itwas hard tof ightback. In the 

ghetto they hadf or the grown
-
ups, 18 and 15, diff erentm anual jobs to be perform ed: Sweeping the 
streets, laying cobblestones, cleaning themarket area. T hat'sfor the older people. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith such harsh rationing,f ood was ver y scarce. How did your f am ily m anagef or 

those several years to m ake endsm eet while living in that kind of envi ronment? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: First, 
there was a black market. Some people took their own lives in their hands going 

out the ghetto, trying to sm uggle in things. Many were caught. Som ewere not. Bringing in products 

through theblack m arket. People who still had cash with them  were able to buy som e things, eggs, 

potatoes,f ruit.Even wi th kerosene,f orf ive liters of  kerosene, oncea week, especially in the 

wintertim e, it wasn't that much. Especially if  you hadto warm  up,m y m other alwa ys cooked at night, 

this way whatever she had to cook,this way s he warm edupthe room  itself  as well. And my f ather 

would be takenevery day in the morning toa certain location to dosom e manual labor, then com e 

back late inthe af ternoon orevening. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather was clearly a very enterprisin
g m a n,  and  yo u  t o l d m e  s omeh ow o r  
another hem anaged to get aholdof  some cattle while in the ghetto.T ell us about that. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Let me go backf irst.W hathappened, one day he worked,he was working them arket 

to clean them arket area, and there was an oldf arm er, what happened bef ore that, letm ego back a 

little bit, thefarmers used to congregate in one specif icplacearound m idnightonW ednesday night, 

because them arket, in Iasi, was onThursday. They congregate in som e area, then go asa c
aravan, 
drive into Iasi and sell the products onT hursday. 
 
W hen he was cleaning the area in them arket this oldf arm er cam eby, and he said tom y father, I'm  
really sorr y what happened to you and yourfam ily. I hope you guys are doing well. And never said
 

anything af ter that. He said, By the way, som e of thef arm ers, we think about you, we know you 

helped usbefore.W etried tohelpasm uch as we can, but we don'tknow how to doanything like 

th a t. 
 
It was thearea we had to getour kerosene, so to get the
 
kerosene you hadto line up at5:00 in the 
m orning to lineupat acertain place.Som e would show up 7:00, 7:30.

>> Bill Benson:  You've been in line since 5:00 in them orning? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct. Imagine rain, snow,heat, depending the weather at
 
th at tim e .The  wa y it 
worked like today, put in your credit card, youget the gasoline.There was a booth where the 
attendant would be inthere, there was a linenext to thebooth,approximately f ivef eet away. Once 

the line was lined up, he motionedforf ive people to com eforward. He will take the ration card, took 

the couponfor thatparticular week. Then hewi ll pum pthe kerosene. The way it works, the pump,on 

thatpum p was a cylinder. Tof ill that cylinderfrom  thebottom was ahandle you pushed back
 
and 
forth.Once youdid that, f ive liters of  kerosene would com eup,then he lowered it intoa can.T hen he 

would get thenextf ive. Then if he didn'tfeel loo it,he just stayed in his boothfor a while, didn't come 

o u t. 
 
Oneday, I decided, Idon't know
 
if  it was arrogance or 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Entrepreneurial. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Let me approachhim , perhaps I can do som ething together with the extra kerosene. 

His name was Gregor.  I neverf orgethis name.W hen m y time cam e and thefive people inf ront 
of  

that line, I saidtohim ,I addressed him as Dom ino, that is someonever y im portant, intellectual. He 

was noneducatedperson,he was adrunkand lazy person. SoI pushedhim , I said Dom ino Gregor, 

I'd like to help you. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're 8 years o
l d ? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  Yeah. He looks at m e, he said 
--
 
I was kind of maybe smaller than he was. He says 
you're going to helpme? 
 
Yeah. 
 
How? 
 
I'll do your job. You look sick, tired,probably didn't sleep so well.W hy don't you rest in thebooth. I'll 

c o ll
ect the coupon and the ration cards.I'll bring them  to you. I'll pum pthe kerosene.W hen m y turn 

com es, give m e a little bit extra. 
 
So he's looking atm e, he said, I'll see. Bef ore long, he says, Goahead.Let m e see what you can do. 

So I start pumping thegasoline. Henever gave me anything. For three weeks I was doinghis work, 

he never gave m e anything. Finally, oneday af ter three weeks,he says to m e, next week bring a little 

extra can with you. From  thatpoint on I was getting perhapsanother liter,
 
liter and a half , alittle extra. 
W hich, num ber one,helped us to warm  up the house. Also sincemy m other was af irm  believer in 

education, she gave so much kerosene to an old teacher in the ghetto teaching us, sharedwith him  

certain things. 
 
T hat worked
 
for a while.T hen I said, if I gotthat,perhaps I can convince him  to give me som ething 
else. So in1944, June of 1944, there was amessage into the ghettothatevery m ale between theage 

of  18 and50m ust assem ble in the synagogue yard, and to bring extra clothing with them  because 

they would be shippedoutfor the east. 
 
My f ather lef t.Theday he left, he said to me,Nat, take care of the girls. So I'm  81/2 years old at this 

point. Thepressure one gets to take careof a m otherand two sisters was eno

But you know, you gro w up very f ast,the wartim e,especially in conditions like that.

So after he left, again, I said,Im entioned that we didn't have any closets in the room , all we had was 
two beds. Everything we had we keptunderneath thebed. One day I tried to get anothershirt f rom  

underneath thebed, and Ifounda bottle thatm y f atherhad. Aplum Brandy. I wrapped it inthe shirt. 

Did nottell m y mother, because sheprobably would have toldme not to do what I was planning todo. 

I wrapped it in anothershirt, brought it to Gregor. I cam e tohim  in the m orning, I said I have a present 

for you. Iunwrappedthe shirt. He saw the bottle of  Schlibalwitz. His e yes got bright. He saidI assum e 

this will cost m e som ething. You want extra kerosene? I saidno, I wantanextra ration card.T his 

wa y, I get anotherf ive liters of  kerosene, another loaf of bread. Bef ore that, I want tom ention, bef ore 

m y f ather lef t, when he went back to clean the m arket area, oneof  thef armers thathe wasver y 

f rie nd ly 
with, m yf ather, said to my father,W e got together and we want to help you. Here's what 
we're going to do, between 2:00 and 3:00 we pass the ghetto where you live. Com eout and watch 

the last three wagons, see what happens.W e wil l tr y to drop som ething for you. 
 
Sof irst,being outsidethe ghettoat 2:00 or 3:00 inthe morning was terrible situation,because, 

numberone, you were considered trying to escape.W ho would go out at that particular time in the 

m orning? My m otherdecided the risk was wo rth it. My f ather came out where thef arm ers told him  to 

be.T he last three wagons created a situation where oneof  the wagons had a problem , and while 

stopping therea sackor package kindof  was thrown towards the side of the road. In thepackage 

were som e potatoes, apples,things like that.Ever y week it was something different. 
 
T his was going onfora while. Af tera while, thefarm er said, I'm  sorry, Anton,m y father's name, the 

authorities aretrying to findout who is leaving stuff for the ghetto, and we're risking our li ves.W e're 

sorry, we can't do that anym oreat this point.So that stopped. 
 
W hile these things were going on, we were getting differentproducts f rom them , certain things. For 

instance, once we gota ham  in the package.Obviously, we kept kosher, so we couldn'teat that. My 

father traded that with otherpeople who were not keeping kosher. 
 
T he way the thing worked, growing up, therewas conf idence in theghetto, so the police know to 

catchanybody with contraband, num ber one, would be arrested, probably worse than that.My f ather 

alwa ys told me, You carry the stuff . Follow me 30 paces away. Once we get to where people are 

trading, then I'll do the trading. So if  you are caught, if a child is caught he gets probably beaten up a 

little bit. Butaf terthat, the ham will be taken awa y f rom him, probably would hurtm orethan the 

beating, but that's what we did. 
 
Lateron, when we we nt to Israel,I was told that they only tookm e to protect him . 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, you were school age in the ghetto. Youm entioned that your education 

was ver y im portant. How were you able to get some education whilein the ghetto? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Number one,I was notallowed to goto schoolat that point anym ore.W edid have 

som e elderly teachers in the ghetto, Jewish teachers.They tried to schoolus.T hat's where we 

learned. Although when we finally were able to go to school af ter the war, we were probably behind a 

year, year and a half f rom the regular children.W e were always theoldest in class.Always  looked at 

us asdum b kids, because we're som uch older and aren't in their class. Eventually we caught up. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How about religious practices?W ere you able to practice? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Ye s, bu t no t op en ly.

>> Bill Benson: W as that a great risk? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: It was.People were standing outside what we called the synagogue area, people 
would stay outsideand notify us when theauthorities show up. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ould the IronGuard ever com e into the ghetto? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah, from  tim e to tim e. Those were thepolice,thepolice that were constantly 

patrolling the ghetto. Lookingf or contraband,lookingf or the black market, which mostof the time 

they never found,because they were m oving around. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his will probably sound likem aybe a silly question in light of  what you've told us 

about going out, protecting your f ather,dealing with Gregor, basically being them an of thefam ily. But 

you were still a kid.W ere you abletodoanything f orfunduring those years you were there?W hat 

did you do asa kid,for a boy? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Didn't do much. I rem ember the only thing in the ghetto we hadother kids, so m y 
m other was taking som e rationand sewing them up, we m adea soccer ball out of that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  A soccer ball out of rags. You playedm arbles with walnuts? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Righ t.W e we re
 
able to get walnutsf rom the trees in thefall.T here was a little hole in 
thedirt, we'd throw the walnuts towards that hole, thenf lip them .W hoever was able to getcloser, 

obviously they would get the whole lot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Get the walnuts? 
 
>> N
a t S h aff ir: Righ t. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told us a little about your father being forced in 1944 to gof orforced labor. It 

where did he go, andwhat do you know about what he was forcedto do? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: In June of 1944he left the house.T hey tookhim east going to lay railroadtracks 

between Rom ania and Poland towards Russia. All thesetimes,for alm osta year, we never heard 

f rom him. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Notaword? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Notaword. Didn't know if he's alive or dead. From  tim e to tim e, we hear som e stories 
about people were m oving further east.That's about itthat we heard. Never heardf rom  him ,until the 

war was over. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of the war ending,you were liberated, Rom ania, Socola ghetto,you 

continued living there until the spring of 1945 when the Russians cam e in and took Iasi and you were 

liberated.T ell us what life was like 
--
 
what it was like to be under Russian attack,and thento be 
liberated, what that was likef or you. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: For quite a while there was bom bardment constantly, day and night. In particular, the 

last three days, rem ember lateronthat was thef inal Russian capturing the city of  Iasi, was 

bombardm entday and night. T he people once bom bardm ent started, outside the ghetto was a little 

f ield we all would go in there.T here was a big ditch, what we calleda bom b shelter.W e would all go 

in there. For threedays we stayed in the bomb shelter. All of a sudden, it was quiet.One individual

f rom  thebom b shelter looked out,andhe said,W e're
 
liberated.W esaid,W hat do you mean we're 
liberated? 
 
Yeah. 
 
W etooka look,far away on the outskirts of thatf ield, there were soldiers dressed in long gra y coats, 
fur hats with the red star on theforehead.W e knew these were Russians. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  You said you went into bomb shelters.T hat creates an im age of a concrete thing 
under the ground. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: It was a dug

up ditch. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ahole in the ground? 
 
>>
 
Nat Shaff ir: Exactly, covered with branches. That'spretty muchwhat thebomb shelterwas. T hat's 
what m ostpeople, it was wet in there,m ost of the people sufferedf rom arthritis later in life, a lotof  

sickn e sse s be cau se of  t h a t.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And wouldn't protect your very m uch. 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: No . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedtom e that you were forcedto blackout your windows during the 

bombardm entperiodbefore liberation. Say a little more about that. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T heIron Guard thought we were Germ an spies.T hat the Jews were Germ an spies. 

No, Russian spies.So the Germansauthorized the Iron Guard to make sure every window of  the 
house would be blackened out, either by paper or no lights being shone out,becausethis was 
s ign a lin g t
he pilotstobe able to drop the bombs ata certain place. 
 
Obviously, people weren't doing that,butdef initely had to blackenthe windows to m ake sure no light 

escaped. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Had you not done that, the penalties would have been severe? 
 
>> N a
t Shaff ir: Severe, yeah. People were shot. Put into prisonfor that.There was wartim e, so 
ever ything went pretty m uch. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now you see the Russian troops, they're here.W hat did that mean?W hatwas it like 

now that you got Russian troops in
 
control? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: First, the Russians gave usfood, num ber one. I rem em ber them  giving us sardines, 

black bread, Russianbread.Theolder beam ,they were gi vin g butter. They tried to take us in and 

helpus a little bit.That was f or a little whil
e . 
 
Bef ore that,eventually, m y father cam eback.W hat happens is that he walkedfor days. Hehitchhiked 

som e wagons. Finally, he showed up.W hen he showed up,obviously, we were happy because we 

never knew if  he everdied or was alive. So whenthe Russianstookover, number one, we were able 

to go back to school. But lif eat thattim e wasn't great either, because the Russians, although it was a 

comm unist regim e,the old regim ebecame com munist. Sothey kindof f lippedand becam e

>> Bill Benson:  Right.But for aperiodof  tim e af ter you're liberated, your father was not back. So 
your m om
 
had no ideahe was alive, still, even though you were liberated. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct. He cam e back som etim e inthe m iddleof  May, perhaps, 1945.T he war was 

over at that tim e.W estill li ved in the ghetto,but didn't know exactly what to do. Hetried tof igure out 

what we can establishcertain things.T hen obviousl y, m y f ather came back, it was easier.Num ber 

one, we were able tom ove out of the ghetto, diff erent location, tried to open up another sm all type of 

fa rm . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You couldn't get the otherfarm  back? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hemain one we had inBuchum, six m onthsaf terhe returned m yf atherandI went 

back to thefarm  to see what's going on.T hefirst thing we did, we stopped at the oldf arm er that 

helped us with the packages f rom time to time.T hey were talking for a while, then the oldfarm er said, 

Anton, I wouldn't com e backhere if I were you, because they're going to kill you. 
 
Now, we tried tof igureout whathappenedto thatfarm .T hefarmer said thatfarm  was divided into 

t h re
e.1/3 given to thepriest's brother

l a w.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he one who denounced you? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T heone who turned us into the authorities.T heother gi ven to them ayor of theoff icial 

that was part of the town. Thethird was some of the IronGuard off icers would get that. So obviously, 

they were choices made. T he priest m ade a choice, because of  f inancial gain. T he f arm er m ade the 

choicebecauseof  rightful gain.T hefarm erhelped us out, knowing that he is in danger himself. He 

risked his own life,not only his own lif e,but the life of hisfam ily if  they f oundouthe's trying to help 

Jewish people. So that's what happened. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nat, do you know when your fam ily realized the,or learned thefull m agnitude of the 

Holocaust and what 
happened to your extended fam ily? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T here were rum ors com ing back that all the Jews f rom  Hungary were sent to 

Auschwitz to be killed. T here's no Jews lef t inHungary at thatpoint.Five months af ter we were 

liberated, that's when the rum ors
 
were com ing in, because we couldn't have any 
--
 
there's no phone 
or any kind of comm unication. 
 
Finally, people were able to travel back intoHungary, and they f igured out that some of the peopleat 

Auschwitz did die, some did survi ve.W eheardf rom  the survivors that som efam ilies were 

im mediately killed, som efam ilies were sent to concentration camps, some families were sent to slave 

labor cam ps. 
 
T he realthing about my f am ily we f ound out only in 1960, approxim ately, when oneuncle who 

survi ved 
--
 
le t  
m e goback a little bit. 
 
W hat happened is that thefam ily f rom Hungary, there were 33 of them , Germany invadedHungary in 

March of 1944.T hat'shistoricalf act. Between April 151944and July 9, 1944, 440,000 Jews were 

deported to Auschwitz.  Among those, 3
3 were som eof m y fam ily. The older ones,the younger ones 

who could not work, once they got to Auschwi tz, they im m ediately were sent to the gas cham bers. 

W ithin six hoursof arrival in Auschwitz they were dead.The rest of them , the ones who were able to 

work, were sent to subcam ps in Auschwitz, to slave labor cam p. Som eof  them  rem ained in 

Auschwitz f or a while. The rest were sent to different cam ps. My grandf atherand two of  his sons,two

of m y uncles, rem ained in Auschwitz at the tim e. My grandf ather di

was liberated.T wo uncles, one 21 years old,one22 years old, weighed65poundseach. Im aginea 
21 or 22

-
old weighing 65 pounds.It's like a walking skeleton. 
 
W hen the Red Cross cam e in, they saw the shape they were in, they were put on ships and sent to 

Sweden, to sanatoriums to recuperate. Unfortunately, oneof  these two brothers, oneof  the uncles 

diedon the way to Sweden and was buried at sea.T he rest of thefam ily were in differentcam ps.W e 

don't know where or when they died. So theonly survi vor f rom  33 people was one,m y uncle, which 

eventually im m igrated to the United States. 
 
So in1960 whenhe cam e to visit us in Israel,he told us the whole story what happened tothefam ily, 

t o  ou r  f am i l y.  
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  Nat, with the war over, your father returned andthefam ily trying to re
-
establish 
yourselves, knowin g that the governm ent included manyf olks thathad been thef ascists and now 

comm unists, you would live under that environm entforf ive years, until 1950, when you imm igrated to 

Israel.W hat were those f ive years like, and how were you able to get out and get toIsrael? 
 
>>
 
Nat Shaff ir: Af ter two years, 1947,m y father realized there's nolonger a f uturefor us in Romania, 
so he appliedfor exit visas toPalestine,at that point. Every tim e, thepapers came back denied. 

Ever y tim e he appliedagain, againdenied. Until he was able to bribe the proper individual, ableto get 

a visa in 1950.Actually, it was this month, April 1950, we arrived in Israel, which was Palestine at the 
tim e.Af terf ive years that we were under the comm unist regim e.It wasn't really pleasant, because 
under com munist regim e, num ber one, Jews  were not allowed to join any kind of  young club or young 

group.T here was a group called thePioneers, which was the best in the class were allowed to join 

the Pioneers.T hough I was a good student,m y sister was a good student, we were never allowed to 

join the Pioneers. That's when we realized there's nofuturef or Jewis h people in Rom ania at that 

tim e.Soeventually in 1950 we went to Israel. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, you ended up, thefam ily, to bribe off icials in order to get yourvisas to 
get out.T ell usabout actually going to Israel, the trip you tookto getthere. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W e went by cargo boat.There was like a cargo hold, somefor men, som efor wom en. 

Ironically, the name of theboat was T ran
sylvania. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Really? Men in one hold, wom en in the separatehold. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah. At night, we com eupon whatever it's called, to see each other. Usually took 2 

1/2 weeks to arrive. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your two sisters, m other and father. Any other? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: No other relatives at thatpoint.T hen otherpeople the same way.W e arrived atthat 
point, in 1950, thenI stayed there until later on. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know, have any ideahow your parents were even able to manag
e to pay 
those bribes? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: My m other still had som e jewelry they were able tocash in, whatever

i n g.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Any survi vin g f am ily m embers rem aining behind inRom ania? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  Yeah, one of  m y uncles, the oldest of  the uncles from  m y f ather's brother, he stayed 
therebecausehis children couldn't leave. Hedid not want to leave the children there, so he stayed. 

Lateron,the childrenwere able to leave, but he couldn't leave anym ore. Then he died inRom ania. 

Also one of the children. He couldhave lef t, but he didn't do that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that recently you did learn that you stillhave, I believe, a cousin or 

relative in Rom ania,but you've had no luck intracking her down. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah, I foundoutthat the older siblings of m yf ather,the one that stayed inRom ania, 

eventually died,had a daughter. She was
 
m y age.W e went to school the same tim e.If ound out 
she's still alive. She must have been at that point, two years ago, year and ahalf ago. I tried tof ind 

outexactly how I can get aholdof her.T hemuseum  tried to help me out. Finally got to thePresi
dent 
of  the Jewish com munity in Iasi. Couldn't connect.Soat this point Idon't know what's happening. 
 
One situation thateventually what's going to happen, m yf riend here, Jeff, he is inthe Army, he goes 

to Europe with NAT Oa lot. T wo years ago, Ithink,he was in Macedonia,he said tom e,dad, why 

don't you com e down here, we'll drive out toRom ania, see where you were born. Som ehow, the 

dates didn't work out, but we still have inm ind todothat. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're 14 years old, you arrive in Israel.W hat do you remember about that? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hef irst orange I saw was 14. I never saw an orange before in m y life.T hat was 

som ething good.T he weather was beautif ul.April tim e, nice weather. People weref riendly. The 

governm ent obviously supplied enough to start us off with. Gave uscertain places to go.Then later 

on, went to school,eventually went to the Army and I served three years in the Israeli Arm y. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here's a story you toldm e about being inthe Arm y during the 1956, thiswas the 
Suez Canal war in 1956. You saw lots of combatand were wounded. If  you don't mind telling us this 

sto ry. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah. We were advancing on Egyptian area in Sinai and I was shot in the knee. They 

evacuated me into a town where m y m other happened to be anurse at the time. Again,no 

comm unication theref rom there.T hef irst time m y mother saw m ewhen they took me inon a 

stretcher to be able to com e into the hospital. So obviously, it was not a good reunion in awa y. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  Yourm other was working in thehospital where you were taken? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Go back a littlebit when yougot to Israel. How did yourf atherestablish him self ? 
W hat did he do toearn a living? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Again, since he was in the dairy product business,he opened up a dairy distribution, 
delivering and selling m ilk andm ilk products. That'show the whole thing started. Althoughhe did go 

to different towns until they were able to get accomm odations andhousing in that particular town. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1961, 25 years old I thinkat the tim e, youmadeanother big move. You came to 
the UnitedStates.Tell us what prom pted youto do that,and what it tookfor you to gethere.

what was happening elsewhere? Even in Rom ania,m uch less elsewhere in Europe?

old boy, what did you think aboutf or thefuture? Did youhave 
dream s?W hat did you thinkm ight becom eof you?W hatdid you want to 
do? T hings kids think about 

or get asked about. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Very good question, by the way. First, we didn't know what's going to happen to us in 

the im mediatefuture. W edidn't know what's going to happen tom orrow, if we survi ve or not while 

go i n g t
hrough the war. T he only thing I was thinking about survivin g and hopingf or a betterfuture. 
Just being with m y f amily and stay alive. But Ireally didn't dream of  anything big or anything like that. 

Perhaps going back tothefarm , perhaps livea norm al lif e.T hat was thefuture we were thinking 

about. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nat, do you think, do you rem em ber, if  your parents believed that somehow or 

another they would survi ve all of this?Or was there just a sense of hopelessness? Obviously, they

were doing am azing things to try to survive. Do you have any senseof  what it was like, what they 
comm unicated to youas kids? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Bothmy parents were ver y str ong people.Bothm entally and alsophysically. My 

father was strong physically too. They always
 
believed thateventually those who believe they will 
survi ve did survi ve. Those who gave up did not survive, because once you gave up you had no 

reasonto live. Sotheykind of gave up. Mostof  the people who survived were strong indivi duals. My 

m other was a strong individual. My wif e could attest to that.She knew that to survi ve she has tothink 

positive. That's what she always taught us,to m ake sure we get oureducation, even intheghetto, 

because eventually yo u're going to need that. Shealways looked som ehow to thef uture knowing it's 

going to bea betterfuture. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you for that question.Right here. OK. 
 
>>W hatm ade you think that you wanted tobecom eanentrepreneur? As you were getting older and 

you hadalso gottenmarried, what made youwant to becom ea businessman? 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatm ade you want to becom e abusinessmanor entrepreneur? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Originally I was not.T hen I met som eother survivor s f romPoland that decidedto go 

into the toy business.They askedm e perhaps I can join them .Thewa y this was in 1970,bef ore 

1970, probably 68, 1968. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're in your 30s? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Right. The way toys were sold atthat point is what, if youtake a look at the 

superm arketthe dead space in the
 
supermarket is the top of  theproducedepartment.T hat space 
doesnot contribute any m oney to the store itself.T his individual, his nam e was Henry Ornstein, 

decided to build toys, put a sampleof  thattoy on the topof  theproduce department. People come
 
t o 
the store on a weekly basis to buy groceries, they put adollar away for thatparticular toy. At 

Christm as tim e, they pay the thing up, likea lay
-
a way plan, by the tim e Christm as comes,they paid 
off  the toy, they accumulateall the orders, and we deliver all the orders prior to Christm as.It was a 

great thing. Later on,the whole thing m ushroom ed out to a larger com pany, the name of topper Toys. 

Com peting with Mattel, ifanybody knows theBarbiedoll or other Mattel toys. T hatm ushroom ed toa 

l a rge r c
om pany andeventually we went public with that com pany. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you. A question over here. 
 
>> Goodm orning. I would like to know, in term s of the languages that you spokeof ,had learned, 

Germ an, Yiddish

back inthe 60s, the com pany went public, late 60s, was a jewelry c om pany. One of m y partners lived

addition to that, whenI was in Israel, I went to Berlitz to study another language, it was Germ an that I 

studied there. Italian Ihadtodobecause theItaliandidn't speak English, so I had toforcem yself  to

ever thoughtabout giving up orfeeling this sense of hopelessnessor dreadthat you cannot live 

another day in the terribleness that you've been through?

wanted to give up, thought you couldn't goon?

Nat Shaff ir: I never gave up. I was som etim es were bad days, som etimes were betterdays. Never
