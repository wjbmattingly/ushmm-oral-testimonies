Interview with Charlene Schiff 
January 29, 2003 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: -- 29
th
, 2003. We™re at the Holocaust Muse
um annex at L™Enfant plaza. My 
name is Neenah Ellis. This is tape one, side
 one. Charlene, you di
d your oral history 
interview 10 years ago, al
mo st exactly 10 years ago. 
Answer: Wo w. 
Q: March ™93. 

A: Really? Almost 10 years ago. 

Q: March ™93. And I just listened to it agai
n. It was a remarkable experience as a 
listener, to hear it. But I want to start, beca
use this is a post-Holocaust interview, at the 
end of that experience when 
you were by yourself in the 
forest. You™d been wandering 
for a couple years, maybe? 

A: A couple -- three winters and two years.  
Q: Three winters, yeah. And y
ou were liberated, as you say -- 
A: At [indecipherable] by -- 

Q: -- by some Russian soldiers -- 
A: -- soldiers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068

Q: -- who found you. 
A: Well, yeah, they were pus
hing th ey -- at that time they were pushing th e Germans 
back and as it happened -- I don™t know, it wa
s I guess, an entire battalion, I™m not sure. 
But Russian soldiers, Soviet Union so ldiers
 were marching through the forest where I 
was dying, actually. I -- usually when I was 
in the forest, I would dig a little grave and 
cover it, camouflage it as mu ch as I could an
d stay there as long as hunger and cold 
would allow me to stay in one place. At th
at point I was very ill,
 I must have eaten 
something that didn™t agree 
with me. And I was in my ow
n filth, surrounded by my own 
filth, and I -- I think I was dying. I don™t real
ly recall one time, I think, that I wasn™t 
actually aware of it, and yet I must have been
 aware. When they literally stepped on me, 
it was dark, at night and all of a sudden I fe
lt -- I mean, in -- in 
the forest there are 
always a lot of noises, so I didn™t hear them coming. Bu t all of a sudden I felt 
something on my  ch est, and it was, I guess, one
 of the soldiers. And they realized it was 
something alive. And to their credit and my 
luck, they  did clean me up and put me in a 
tent in a -- a military hospita
l and dragged me with them 
until we came to the city of 
Luck , L-u-c-k, which is in 
the area where I come from. 
And there they found a -- a 
regular hospital and they left me there. 
And apparently -- I never saw the note, but 
apparently  there was a note saying -- and I™m paraphrasing, but it was something like, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
4
this is a child of the forests. Treat her gent
ly, with great care. And that note was pinned 
to me, to my -- whatever I was wearing. All -- 
Q: How old were you at this time? 
A: In that time -- I -- it 
was in 1944, so how old wa
s I? 19 -- I guess it was -- 
Q: You were born in ™29? 

A: Yeah, December ™29, and that was -- 
Q: So you were 14 - 15? 
A: -- 14 -- 14 years old, or so, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Do you remember 
them carry -- they must ha
ve carried you. Do  you 
remember any of that? 

A: No, I -- 

Q: Do you remember th
em speaking with you? 
A: No, all I remember is someone kept sa
ying yebishka, yebishka and th at means in 
Russian, l-little girl, little girl. But I did no t speak. I don™t remember speaking. I kept 

throwing up, and I was very, very ill. And -- 
but I vaguely rememb er it. And then when 
I did get into  the hospital -- yeah, I don™t th
ink they carried me. I 
think they had like a -- 
horses with wagons. And I don™
t really know, maybe they did carry me, but they did 

have that. And then  they woul
d have tents in forest -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
5
Q: Camps, they had camps, mm-hm. 
A: Camp s, yes, uh-huh. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And they treated me very well. And later on, after the war we went to Russia 

because I went back to my hom
etown, which is another story,
 which I™ll tell you about. 
Q: You told  some of that
 in the first interview. 
A: Did I? 

Q: About going back , mm-hm, you did. 

A: Where they tried to -- 
Q: And when you went to the town 
and then  tried to take your son. 
A: Yeah, did I tell about that? 

Q: Yeah, you did, yeah. 

A: Well, anyway, but I tried to find out who 
were -- what kind of a te -- who were the -- 
the soldiers, especially  the 
two soldiers who first found me, and were so -- gave me 
back my  life. And I couldn™t get names or a
nything. I know one th ing, that I still had a 
gold coin, and I th -- the coins and all the 
jew elry that my mother sewed in, I don™t 
know if I told that in
 my first interview -- 
Q: Yes, you did, how she put
 them into your clothes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
6
A: Yes, but a -- I lost the coat and all that
. And so then I had like a rope, a -- a real 
heavy rope that I wore on my neck. And that
 and my little penknife I had with me and 
the gold -- gold coins and what
ever else, and jewelry. And I still had one coin and I 
gave it to them, to the two so
ldiers. I -- I do remember that, 
that was it. But other than 
that, there was no real thank 
you or anything, for giving me
 back my life. But when I 
ended up in the hospital at Luck, that™s 
where they nursed me
 back to, I guess, 
reasonable health. I did not speak
 for a long, long time, and 
I do remember th at -- how I 

regained my speech. I was on a ward. At that 
time, I mean, there were no private rooms, 
or if there were I wasn™t in one. And I was 
just in my cot, whatev
er, in clean sheets, it 
was wonderful. And -- but I did not speak. And th en all of a sudden there was an 

attendant. It was not a docto r and it was not  a nurse, but a young woman. And she was 

sort of humming wh ile she was doing things 
and all of a sudden  she started singing a 
song that my mother used to 
sing to me. And, I mean it ju st gave me chills and I started 
talking. That, you know, brought back my
 speech. And it was a very, you know, 
emotional day at that time. But when I was nu rsed back to health, I found there was one 

other surv ivor from my  hometown . And it seem
ed that most of th
e survivors -- the war 
was not over yet in 1944, but
 fo r us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over. And 
so everybody who surv iv
ed tried to gather in a larger
 town. And Luck,or Lvov, wh ich 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
7
now is called Lviv were the two big cities a
nd all the little shtetls were in between. And 
Horochow, my town, wa
s also in between. So a lot of  people gath ered in Luck, and 
that™s where I was, in that hospital. And I 
came out of the hospital, I found a lot of -- 
not a lot, but survivors. And I did meet th
e other surviv or from my  hometown. They  say 
that there are more people wh
o survived, but these were 
people who my  father and 
other people in Horo chow helped  escape be
fore the war started and who eventually 

ended up in what was then Palestine. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And as a matter of fact, when we went, my
 husband and I went to
 Israel a n u mber of 
years ago, I can™t remember wh
en, the st -- th ese were old students of my father™s and 
they gath ered togeth er and they  had an even
ing dedicated to the memory of my father. 

Q: Wow. 

A: And that was very -- it was very
 -- it made me feel very good. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But coming b
ack to Luck. 
Q: Before we go, can you put this on the tabl
e, cause I can hear it pretty si -- loudly. 
Yeah, that™s fine. 

A: Sorry. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
8
Q: That™s okay. So  you -- you went to this 
meeting, people were gathering, surv ivors 
were gathering and you met this one surviv
or who was from your town, somebody that 
you knew before? 
A: Well, she was -- sh e used to be a st 
-- a part time stu d ent of my father™s. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- because my father taught at the 
university in Lvov, bu
t he also taught in 
Horochow. There were several different sc
hools there and there was a gymnasium. A 
gymnasium is a -- not a gymnasium here, lik
e here, but it is the next step after high 
school. Sort of an in-between school. Bu
t anyway , I did know her family. She was 
actually married before the war and had a ba
by, but she lost her 
entire family, and sh e 
survived  by herself. And the two of us decide
d to go back to my  hometown, and -- to 
our hometown and to  find out maybe some ot
her people or our loved ones survived. 
And so we set out. Transportation 
was very difficult in those days. 
Q: How far was it? 

A: Well, it wa -- by car now, it would be an  ho
ur and a half, that™s all. And at that time 
there was no car -- there were no cars availabl
e. Trains were going maybe once a week 
or so, so you had to hitchhike
, and -- with the soldiers, with
 the military or with farmers 
in trucks, or just wagons with horses. It 
took us two days to get back to our -- our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
9
hometown. And there we were 
not greeted very warmly. The 
people in our hometown -
- and this was going on all over eastern Poland
, I don™t know about other countries, but 
in eastern Po -- what used to
 be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and th ey 
did get everything. All our po
ssessions, all our material possessions ended up in their 
hands because when  we were ordered to go in
to the ghetto, we could only take with us 
what we could carry, nothing else. And so ev
erything else went to the neighbors and 
whoever got ahold of it, or -- 
I don™t know how the Germans and th e Ukrainians at that 
time directed and disposed of all the mate
rial  goods. And then
 there were homes, 
houses. And they felt, I™m sure, th e 
local populace, that whoever survived  

[indecipherable] will come and say now, I wa
nt my house back, I want my -- all my 
furniture back. I want 
my linens, my silver, 
my -- all sorts of stu
ff. And that probably -- 
and besides, there was still, 
and still is, there™s great anti-
Semitism in that area. And 
they resented our surviving and that made us 
feel very, very hurt. And it seemed at that 
point that there was a movement that -- you 
know how rumors star
t and all, and there 
was a movement in our -- our -- our directi
on for everyone to gather in Germany. Why 
in Germany? 

Q: Let me ask you on
e question before -- 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
10
Q: -- we go to Germany. Do  you rememb er
 any -- I know it™s a long time ago, but do 
you remember any sp ecific encounters with 
people in your hometo
wn when  you went 
back that first time? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And did you go to your house? 

A: Yes. 
Q: And you mu st have seen neighbors 
or people that you knew quite well -- 
A: Yes, yes -- 
Q: -- cause it had -- was only a few years -- 
A: -- yes, yes. 
Q: -- that you were away. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So do you remember a
nything [indecipherable]  
A: Yeah, the first thing I would say th -- an
d I mean, oh, you™re Professor Perlmutter™s 
daughter. I said yes. And, yo
u know, and I would ask of so
me -- because o-of school, 
people wh o went -- I mean, kids who went 
to school with me, you know. And I said 
where is such and such, you know, Marusha 
Trikoska who was right
 -- living near us 
and all. And couldn™t find anyone that went 
to school with me, or the younger people, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
11
but the older people kept saying, oh, you ar
e so -- my  -- my  dear, dear girl, you know. If 
only we knew what was happening, what wa
s going on, we would have helped . Well, 
how could th ey not have kn
own? And I mean they were right there, we were 
surrounded by our neighbors befo
re we went into the ghetto
 and I-I mean especially in 
the very beginning, the Germans when  they  
first came in , they had lists with names 
whom to take. And when my father was -- when
 they came after my father and that was 
right in the very beginning af
ter they burned the synagogues 
and all that, and my father 
tried to esc ape through the ba
ck door, there were two Ukra
inians right there, who we 
knew, and they wouldn™t let him -- they woul
dn™t even let him say goodbye to us. So 
they knew. But that was thei
r response; if only we knew, 
we would have helped . And 
that™s -- tha t -- that -- I  heard that all over 
in my neighborhood. The house, I did not go 
into my house. 

Q: Somebody had taken it over? 
A: Oh yes -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- somebody was living there. And I -- 
Q: It was a nice house. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
12
A: It was a very nice house, and as a matte
r o f fact, I mean there were still several 
rooms, I think tw o ro oms that were never fini
shed because my father had hoped that we 
would go to the Un ited States and he, just at
 that point he didn™t want to put -- we 
weren™t rich, I mean he was an educator. And 
-- but the thing was that he didn't want to 
put any more money into the house, and he 
left two rooms or so unfinished, and they 
were still u n finished at the end of war, or 
when we came, you know, to -- to see. My 
friend, the other survivor, liv
ed actually on the outskirts 
of Horochow, and it was a little 
village, almost like a suburb and the name
 of it was Skamelka. And she went back 
there, and she didn™t find anyone very rece
ptive, very happy a
bout her survival. She 
was actually hidden by a farmer throughout th
e entire war. So she had one friend. What 
is so very puzzling to me -- it™s n o t puzzling,
 it™s just very disappointing to this day. 
I™ve gotten rid of the hate and the anger b
ecause it was destroying me personally, but I 

feel a great disappointment by the fact or fro
m the fact that our neighbors and our to wn , 
where we co-existed in a very nice way, my
 father and mother and other Jewish leaders 
were working hand in hand 
with the Gentile population 
for the good of the entire 
community. And I™m not just saying th at, but 
it™s such a puzzlement 
to me that friends 
and neighbors who lived in -- in harmony, a
ll of a sudden, overnight could tu rn into 

enemies, an d not one of them helped. And 
I know it was dangerou
s to help, but when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
13
my  mo ther was digging ditches outside 
from -- you know, in the ghetto and she was 
trying to  trade something fo r food, not one 
of our neighbors woul
d give her anything. 
Strangers would, but not our neighbors
. Why? Why such  hate? I-I -- I cannot 
understand it. And I don™t know -- now I wa
s thinking maybe it™s envy. It was envy 
because they wo
rked hard, most of them were poor
 peasants, you know, and they never 
accomplished anything in their 
lives. They never became e
ducated, they didn™t stress 
education. And they  were always work ing and 
they were poor peasan
ts in the beginning 
and they  were poor peasants at the end. 
And maybe that™s why,
 I don™t know. But 
anyway, we did realize that we were not 
welcome in Horochow an d other people who 
went back to the neighboring 
villages and shtetls had the sa
me reception as we did, and 
so we set out to go to Germany at -- 
Q: And did you find out anything about your 
parents or your sister in that visit? 
A: Well, at that time I only 
fou -- I found I didn™t -- nobody knew anything about my  
mother, but in retrospect I™m
 sure that she was probably 
killed by a bullet or so and 
drowned in the -- in the -- 

Q: River. 
A: -- river. But -- they wouldn™t tell me who,
 but my  -- my  sister was denounced. And 
there again is a long story and I don™t know if 
I mentioned this in my  oral story that I, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
14
you know, gave with  Dr. Ring
elheim, but my sister was actually a mu sical prodigy, and 
she played the piano and sh e al
so played the violin extra, 
extra beautifully. As a matter 
of fact, at one time -- and th at was way befo re
 the war started, my father bought a very 
well known, a very -- a name -- I can™t rememb
er. It was not a Stradivarius, but a very 
good violin for my sister 
because she was exceptionally-- an exceptional artist. And 
she played  in recitals and sh e would have go
ne far because it was her love of her life. 
And wh en we went to the ghetto, I know my
 -- I can™t remember 
what I said in my 
story, but I don™t know if I even emphasized th
at, but my  mo ther kept telling us to take 
only, I mean, just clothing and only the dearest 
things that we wanted to have with us. 
She took all the pictures. We don™t have any 
pictures, my mo ther did take them and of 
course we lost them. But my sister  did not listen to my mother, an
d whatever sh e took I 
don™t know, but she also took her violin to  
the ghetto. Actually, she 
should have given it 
to the Germans because
 they wanted all musical instru
ments and all, but she wouldn™t 
part with that violin. And what she did, sh
e was wearing a loose dress, and she took th e 
violin and th e wh at do you call, the bow out of the -- 

Q: Case? 
A: -- case, and she didn™t take the case.
 But she took them and she tied it with 
something, you know, but she 
would not part with it. An
d wh en my  mo ther found a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
15
place for her with a farmer, and it was time fo
r her to go there, she went right from 
work. I don™t recall exactly ho
w, but she took her violin 
with her. And I was told two 
versions, I™m not -- I™m not sure which is ri
ght. One that the -- the farmer who agreed 
with my mother to hi
de my sister -- one person, my 
sister, that he denounced her 
because he wanted the vio
lin. And the other one was th
at she was denounced by 
someone else and she was paraded naked th
rough the main str
eet and then they 
mu rdered her. I don™t know wh ich is the right 
story, but that™s what I was told by my  
neighbors when we came back to learn the 
fate of the rest of our families, and -- 
Q: So you found that out -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- that -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- first time you went home? 
A: But they wouldn™t give me names. No
body would give me name s of the -- I didn™t 
even know the name of the farmer who was hi
ding, or was supposed 
to hide my  sister. I 
didn't  know that. And I don™t know if 
I was too stupid, I just didn™t know. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
16
A: And -- but I did know the name of the guy,
 the farmer who was supposed to  hide my  
mo ther and me, and actually I did know and I do
n™t know if I said it in my other story, 
but we used to buy dairy products from that -- 
Q: Yes, you told that -- 

A: Did I say that? 

Q: -- yes, and th en you went there after you lost your mo th er -- 
A: Yes, I did. 
Q: -- and he had your father™s gold watch. 

A: Yes, yeah, did I say that? 
Q: Yeah. And he would only
 let you stay overnight. 
A: One day. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, one day and then wh en  it got dark  -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- out I went. And I asked if he was stil
l alive when  I went back  and they  said, oh 
yeah, h-he was still alive. An
d -- but I never, when we went
 back, I mean
, we only had 
an hour and a ha -- two hours 
they told me, and we couldn™t
 go, but God willing, before 
I die -- I don™t know if he™s still alive, but 
I™m sure some of his 
-- you know, sons and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
17
daughters are probably still there,
 and I do want to face. I wa
nt to meet them face to 
face and talk to them. 
Q: So you went then , 
you and this other -- 
A: Sonia. 
Q: Sonia, went to Germany? 

A: Yes. 
Q: You heard that there was going to
 be a meeting there, a gathering. 
A: Gathering. 
Q: A gath ering. 
A: That everyone who survived  was gather
ed there. Why? Because there -- we were 
safer there, because it was -- 
they had the American -- 
Q: Sector, mm-hm. 
A: -- sector. Then they had 
the French and the British and 
the Russian. And of course 
we wanted to go to the Amer
ican sector. And we -- our jour
ney was also an experience. 
Again, there was no transportation. We didn™t have I.D.s, we didn™t have anything, we 

were just, you know, stragglers. But we went
 by groups and we had to travel illegally. I 
didn™t have any money or anything, but othe
r people did have some
, and we went in -- 
in groups. And so we ended up going from Lu
ck to Kraków, which is
 the southern part 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
18
of Poland. And then from Kraków we made 
our way to Bratislava
, which was at that 
time Czech oslovakia, and from there -- and peopl
e along the way, as long as it wasn™t 
the militia, you know, were ve
ry kind. They would give us
 bread, and so metimes they 
would ev en bring some like hot soup or so to
 feed us. And from Bratislava we ended up 
in Vienna, where the reception wasn™t very
 good. And then from Vienna we finally 
ended up in Munich. And in  Munich, or righ
t around th e area of Munich, we were put 
in what they called DP camps, Displace
d Person™s camp s. Now th ese camps were 
actually under the ausp ices, the people who 
formed and organized these camps, it was 
the United Nations Rehabilitatio
n and Relief Agency. Gee, I 
got it out right. And they 
were the main people who organized these ca
mps. It was the first 
experience, the first 
camp -- I can™t remember where it was, it wasn
™t actually outside of Munich. I think I 
ended up someplace -- Salzheim, 
Salzheim, I think in Austria,
 that was my first camp. 
And there -- and you know, at that point ever
ybody so rt of went th eir own way. I lost 
my  -- Sonia, I -- I -- you know, she ended up so
meplace else. But the first experience in 
the camp was very traumatic. We were still fi
lthy, we had lice. We really needed a 
disinfection. And the way it was given to us 
was rather primitively. I remember we had 
to undress, and it du -- didn™t matter if ther
e were man, women. It was one corner there 
with maybe a sheet hanging in between. You ha
d to strip completely 
and then they put a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
19
hose on you. And th e hose had wh ite -- it lo
oked like wh ite powd er. And th at powd er, I 
can still smell it. I feel it in
 my body. That powder was 
an anti what do you call it, 
disinfective -- 
Q: Sometimes they used DDT.  

A: Maybe that -- 

Q: Sometimes they did, yeah. 
A: -- it smelled like sulfur and like rotten e
ggs, and they  kept spraying -- and I™m not 
exaggerating, for maybe two hours. And it 
seems by the time you were finished -- my  
hair was chopped anyway because I had so 
many lice and all, everybody was filthy. But 
they kept spraying without mercy. And I 
kept saying enough, en
ough, you know, in 
Yiddish or in Polish. They di
dn™t pay any attention to  you.
 And by the -- after your -- 
you were finished with that powder that pe
netrated every pore of 
your body, th en they 
made you go and take a show
er. And of co urse the shower
 was pretty cold. But it was 
good -- 
Q: To get clean. 

A: -- to get clean. And I mean, we still weren™t 
really clean and I think a week later they 
would line us up again and spray maybe for 
half an hour. And th ey did this several 
times. So by the time we came 
to Munich, or the ti -- by th
e time I came to Munich, I

was pretty decent. I mean, I -- I didn't have
 any lice crawling around my body and I -- I 
had some kind of -- they gave me a dress, 
an d a pants -- no, I don™t remember, but an 
outfit. 
Q: And you were feeling better physically? 

A: Not really. 

Q: No. 
A: No, no -- 
Q: You were -- 

A: -- I felt very -- 
Q: What was your physical condition? 
A: My physical condition wasn™t
 bad. Emotionally all of us
 were very distraught and 
very disappointed. I was very confused an
d I still had hopes that I would find my 
mother. Because they
 said in Horochow
, nobody knew about 
my mother. And I 
couldn™t face the reality and the fact that she 
vanished  and sh e perished right there when  
I was there. I still to this day, I don™t kn
ow, but it seems I™m -- I™
m getting away from it, 
but when I walk on a street and I see someone
 with the build of my
 father or mother, 
they were both very tall -- t
hough look at me, I™m a shrimp
. But my father was over six 
foot, about six four or so, very, very tall. An
d my mother was very 
tall, almost six foot 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
21
tall. And when I see people, you know, wa
lking from the back and it reminds me of 
their build, I have to rush up
 and look back and see, because I still think maybe it™s 
them. Anyway, when
 we came to Munich and we -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is tape one, side two, Charle
ne Schiff. Okay, you new -- came to Munich. 
A: When I came to M unich we w-were -- at 
that point we were assigned to some DP 
camps, and there was one DP camp a little 
bit outside of Munich by the name of 
Fernwald. That™s one of the big DP camps a
nd one of the ones that I spent a lot of time 
in. I came there and I was assigned a space to 
live. A bunk, a bed, a very narrow bed, 
and a little like a foot locker, 
like a locker, and that was mine. I was given a cake of 
soap, the first time I think in
 five years. In the other camps where I was disinfected and 
all, they didn™t have that. It was very, very, 
very primitive. But in
 Fernwald it was sort 
of a little more luxurious. I did get a toothbru
sh  for the first time in five years. I got 
some toothpaste and as I said a -- a cake of
 soap, and a little rag that was my towel. And 
food was still rationed three times a day. It
 was adequate, but I was still very hungry 
most of the time, in the begi
nning. But at that time, I 
k n ew my  m -- I reme mb ered  my

grandmother™s address in the United Stat
es. Because all my young life I think the 
conversations between my  parents and me we
re always centering around the f -- the 
fact, when we get to America. And anyw
ay , I -- my  grandmother™s address was 231 
Echo Place, Bronx 57, New York
. And I wrote a letter to my
 grandmother and told her 
that I was alive and I™m looking fo r my  parents and my  sister, but I -- 
Q: This was your father™s mother? 
A: Yes, yeah. And she was a widow when sh
e emigrated to America. I -- it didn™t take 
very -- I mean, it wasn™t right away
, but I did get an answer shortly. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: Her name was Hana, Hana Perlmutter. A
nd I saw pictures of her -- I mean, I knew 
her from pictures, because I don™t know if 
she emigrated before 
I was born or after. 
Time before is sort of hazy to me. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I don™t think I ever met her actually, in person. Bu t I did receive an answer and I 
don™t know who wrote it, but one of the sister
s, apparently, one of my  aunts wrote it. 
And I was informed that my grandma died duri
ng the war. Ostensibly 
later they told me 
of a broken heart because her one and onl
y son never joined her, my father. But 
anyway, the sisters, th e aunts got together 
and sent me papers and affidavits which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
23
testified to the fact that I would not become
 a burden to  the government and so I should 
be allowed to emigrate right away. And oh, wh en I got these papers I didn™t know what 
-- because it was all in English and I had 
to, you know, go to so
meone who spoke it, 
who understood English and they
, you know, translate it a
ll to me. A nd I -- I was so 
happy, and I went to the consulate. And I 
can™t remember, I think I had to go to 
Bremen, I™m not quite sure where. And there my enthusiasm and my hope were 

extinguished right away. Oh, th
at™s not enough, you have to
 have other papers, and we 
have so many people who are 
-- who need  to go befo re you. And we™ll let you know, 
don™t call us, we™ll call you or su -- or someth
ing to that effect. So
 I went back to the 
DP camp very, very disappointed. And at that
 point I really didn't know what to do. I 

started a correspondence with my family in
 the United States and they kept sending 
new papers, and you know, thinking th ey need
 this and that. And every time I™d  go to -- 

to Bremen, which cost, at that point cost a 
lot of money to go, and then I would come 
back with nothing accomplished.
 At that time I™m still -- 
I mean, kept looking, and I 
don™t know if -- if anyone else was telling 
you this, but wherever we went, we would 
always have a big board or some kind of a 
wall, and everybody would leave little notes, 
paper notes, say, do you know such  and such
? I am from there and you know, and my  
name is such and such. If you have ever h
eard of someone, you know, please let me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
24
know and give an address. Cause phones were
 not as, you know, a-available as they are 
here. But write here and -- and let me kno
w. And a lot of people did get some 
connections from these 
information walls as it were -- w e
re ba -- as it were. I did not 
get any information from my family, or from anyone else in my 
town. I know at the 
museum they keep saying that there were more than two survivors, but again -- 
Q: From your town? 
A: Yes, but these people who su rvived, we
re not actually from 
Horochow. They were 
from different villages and all, because the 
only one who survived
 with me was this 
Sonia, which has died  last year, actually. 

Q: She made it to the States? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Oh, oh. 

A: Oh yeah, she made it to the States. 
She remarried and she had two wonderful 
children, very accomplished. On
e is a -- a radiologist in Ca
lifornia, and the daughter 
also has a very important job in  the Sa
n Francisco area. Sonia actually, and her 
husband, they lived in 
Dulu th, Minneso ta because she had some family there, and th at™s 
where they started their new life. And she 
would have been another sh -- you know, 
wonderful designer because she 
had golden hands. I remember the first thing she made 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
25
in Luck before we left, she 
made me an outfit from an old military blanket. And that™s 
what I was wearing until we came to the DP camps. 
Q: When you were in that
 camp near Munich, far -- 
A: Fernwald, Fernwald. 
Q: Fernwald, and going back  and forth and tr
ying to get to Ameri
ca, what did you do? 
What -- what -- wa -- h o w did you spend y
our time? Did you ha
ve friends? Did you 
have a boyfriend? 

A: Well, yes -- no. 

Q: Lot of people -- lot of people hooked  up right away  -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- and got married immediately  -- 

A: I did -- yes -- 

Q: -- in those camps. 
A: -- no, I did not. And I -- I -- I felt if I didn
™t have family in the United States, I would 
have probab ly gone to Israel
. And I did get invi -- it wasn™t Israel, it was Palestine at 
that time. I got involved with
 the Betar, B-e-t-a-r, it™s the -- they were vini -- revisionist 
group and they had like a kibbutz in Fernwa
ld. And I went there in the very beginning 
and I met very nice young people. Men, wo me
n and -- I mean, girls and boys. But after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
26
they figured out -- and I -- I guess
 I told them, I wasn™t going 
to pretend, that actually I 
was hoping to go to  the United States, I coul
dn™t be there any longer. And so  I found a 
place -- or, they f -- assigned me another place 
to live. But when my 
efforts to join my 
family in -- in the United St
ates were coming to nothing, 
I decided that perhaps -- I only 
had a third grade education -- I decided mayb
e I could go to school and emigrate on a 
student visa. And at that time I felt that -- 
I don™t know why, but there was a DP camp  
by th e name Benzheim and that was between 
Darmstadt and Fran kfurt, and very close 
to Heidelberg. And I™m not sure, but I th
ink my  father had a lot of, you know, 
docto rates, and one of them, 
I think, was from Heidelberg. And I went to Heidelberg 
and I spoke German at that -- 
you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a 
student. And they so rt of looked me up an
d down , and where ar
e your papers, you 
know, from school? And I said I have none. And 
they  were very help ful. They  gave me 
a tutor and they took all so
rts of cr azy tests. A nd because, I guess, I was a Jewish 
survivor, they accepted me
. I stayed there for over a year, 
and thought that I would go -- 
emigrate on a student visa. But by that time 
my  papers started taking on importance and 
I eventually  ended up going on 
the papers that my  family
 provided for me. But it took 
three years after the war before I ended up 
in the United States. There™s one other thing 
that I would like to mention, and I do mentio
n it all, you know, when  I speak to schools, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
27
and -- wh ich I™ve been doing since 1985, an d we™ll get back to that. I -- it was very 
difficult for me to comprehend and to underst
and that even after the war, there were 
pogroms in Poland. Not just eas
tern Poland, but all over Po
land. Now, the eastern part 
of Poland, after the war ended, became the pr
operty of the Soviet Union. So  Po land was 
actually divided. And the Po land that I kne
w from before the war was no more. It was -- 
a third of it was chunked off to th e Sovi
et regime. And wh at was going on all over 
Poland were pogroms, after the war. And th
e local populace was so resentful of our 
surviving that to them the onl
y solution of getting 
rid of us is to kill us. And I don™t 
know if you™ve ever heard of Kielce. Kiel
ce is someplace -- my  geography is not that 
good, but I think it™s in central Poland. And 
Kielce was a big town , a big city and had a 
lot of Jews before the war. On
 the fourth of July, 1946, th
e local populace got together 
and murdered 42 Jewish
 survivors. And that was one of the mo st infamous pogroms. I 
think they mention it on th e second floor in
 the mu seum, when th
ey talk about DP 
camps and all. Kielce, one of 
the mo st infamous pogroms. 
And that was devastating to 
hear when  we were in the DP
 camp s, about these happenings. And this was going on all 
over the place in Poland. So wh
en anybody says that now th
ere are no Jews in Poland, 
and consequently there can™t be any anti-Sem
itism, it ain™t so. It™s
 not so, and I would 
like to -- I wanted to
 make that point.

28
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: Now back to my -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I wa -- 

Q: So you -- you -- your paperwork came through -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- eventually.  
A: Eventually. 

Q: And you were in -- st
udying near Heidelberg? 
A: In Heidelberg. 

Q: In Heidelberg. 

A: Yeah, in the University of Heidelberg
. But actually, what I was doing, I was not 
getting grades there. I was what do you call 
it, a -- what do you call when you go -- you 
take courses, but you™re not grad ed ? 

Q: I don™t know monitoring classes? I don™t know. 

A: Well, I mean, I -- I -- I was not -- I --
 there™s a special word and I can™t --  
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
29
A: -- think of it now. But I mean, I -- at that
 point it was, you know,
 i-it -- I mean it -- 
my  thought was good in  the beginning but it di
dn™t work out anyway, because I just left 
and -- and I went and I ca -- I mean, I did re
ceive the word that it™s -- you know, my 
time has co me. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I ca -- arrived, I was -- I arrived on 
the Marine Flasher. That™s the boat™s name 
and there is a picture of the boat -- of the ship, you can call it boat, in the mu seum on 

the second floor. 

Q: Oh. 
A: I mean, it™s not ba -- I™m not on the p -- in
 the picture, but that™s the ship that I 
arrived in th -- 
Q: Where did you leave from? 

A: From Bremen, Br
emerhaven, yeah.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I was sick as a do
g all during our journey. 
Q: Seasick. 
A: Seasick, oh, and I mean I 
-- I couldn™t even keep Coke 
down, they ga -- nothing, it 
was terrible. And I™m still not a very good 
motion traveler, but I arrived in the United

States, June 25
th
, 1948, in New York. And my aunt 
from Colu mbus came to pick me up 
and -- 
Q: Can I ask you about that experience of 
come -- did you co me in on boat during the 
day? Did you see New York ? 
A: I was so sick. 

Q: You don™t remember. 
A: I didn™t --  
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t rememb er anything. I don™t re
member seeing the Statue of Liberty. 
Q: Mm. 

A: No-N othing, I was too sick, no. And as a 
matter of fact, I™ve ha -- I remember when 
I came and mo st of the people were being pi
cked up in  the wh at do you call -- the Po rt 
of ath -- of authority. And there were two 
young people, cause my  -- my  aunt had to 
come from Columbus to 
New York  to go -- she 
had to go to her sister, one of th e sisters 
and there -- from there she was 
going to  go to the port of au
thority, or whatever you call 
it. But she was late. Trai -- she came by trai
n and the train was late, or something. So 
the people who met me at the port was a 
young co uple, I don™t know who th ey were. 
And it was an engaged couple, another cousin
 Rosalie from New York, from another ci 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
31
-- another sister™s daughter and her fiancé
. And the fiancé, Stanley, who eventu -- I 
mean, married her, he recogni
zed me because I sent them 
a picture of me from the DP 
camps. And they were looking and looking and 
I didn™t know for whom to look and he 
recognized me from th e picture 
and they picked me up and to ok me to my  Aunt Belka™s 
place, which was also it the Bronx someplace
. And there was my aunt from Columbus. 
And I want to describe to you that mo ment 
because that is something I™ll take to my 
grave. When I -- when I me
t -- I mean my -- my cousin
 Rosalie from New York  who 
came to pick me up and Stanley, her boyfriend 
at th -- her fiancé. They were nice young 
people and they tried to talk Yiddish and 
it was just not very successful. And then I 
came to my  Aunt Belka, who lived near wh ere my  grandmother lived, and -- used to 

live. And there was this apartmen t, a very small apartment. And there, when I came in, 

there was my aunt from Columbus, Aunt Be
rtha -- Brocha. And I™ve never in my life 
seen such a wa -- vision of b
eauty. She was very petite -- 
all my fath er™s sisters are 
short or were short and that™s the way I am
. But she was blonde, she was petite. She had 
-- her hair was beautifully coiffed and she wa
s wearing a green, a silk green dress. It 
was in the summer, obviously. She made that 
dress. She made all her clothes and some 
of mine, too. And her daughter, Rosalie™s. Sh
 -- the dress had a V neck, with a double 
collar in green and the bodice was very tightly
 fitting and then it was a flared skirt with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
32
piping and the we -- the west -- the waist a
nd short sleeves, and she was wearing high 
heels and silk stockings, and she wore make
-up. And she had blue
 eyes and her skin 
was like -- like peaches. She wa
s beautiful. I™ve never seen
 anybody -- she was -- she 
looked a little bit like Zsa Zs
a Gabor, only she was prettier. 
She was really was a beauti 
-- a stunning beau ty. And sh e started to spea
king to me in Yiddish, and she gave me a 
hug, and I™ll never forget that. She was so good to me.  
Q: You must have just felt so relieved and so -- 
A: Well, no, I didn't feel -- I felt awed -- 

Q: Awed. 
A: -- by her. Yeah, I felt such, oh, there wa
s such a beau ty . And she™s my  aunt, you 
know? And sh-she was really so
 beautiful that before lear
ning of her goodness and of 
her wonderful qualities otherwise, I was just
 awed by her physi
cal beauty. Everyone 
was always awed by her physical beauty. She 
was an -- I should have
 brought a picture, 
because I do have pictures of her. She was 
probably the most beautiful creature I have 
ever met. I don™t see movie stars who are as 
beautiful as she is. An
d she was al so very 
smart. And she was a very special woman. An
d she was very good to me. She was wise 
and she tried her best to give me the love th
at I needed at that 
time. But her heart was 
also broken at that time, because she had lo
st her husband very  shortly before I came to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
33
the United States, and she had a younger -- a 
young daughter, two years younger than I, 
but the same birthday, the same month and 
same day. And then sh e had two married 
sons. The first thing they did after getting 
acquainted with my  Aunt Brocha and my  
Aunt Belka, who was also a very good lookin
g wo man with dark hair
 and dark  eyes and 
dark comp lected, but also very nice and tried -- 
Q: They were sist ers?  
A: Yes, yes. And sh-she -- th-they both -- everyo
ne tried to be very nice to me, b u t what 
they did at first, and that 
hurt so much, I came, and before
 I came to the States, I did 
receive several care packages. They said they 
-- they sent an awful 
lot of them to me 
personally. I only got about three or four in
 all the years. Someone else was helping 
themselves to my pack
ages. But in the pack
ages there were cigarettes. And cigarettes 
were a very desire -- desired commodity. I w
ould sa -- I wasn™t doing any black market 
there, I guess I was. I would sell the cigare
ttes, I didn't smoke. And with the money I 
got myself outfitted to go to America. So I 
had leather boots up to my knees, and I had 
a little herringbone coat. And I had, I can™t remember what kind of dress, and I had 
another dress in a little suit case. My hair that time was 
long, and the fashion was to 
have ringlets. And I didn™t wear any make
-up or anything. What was I, 17 or so? 
Q: 17 - 18? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
34
A: But they took me into th
e bathroom and the first thing 
they did, without asking me 
or anything, they took off my  coat, they 
took off my  boots, th
ey say a young girl 
doesn ™t wear that here. And 
they chopped 
off my hair. 
Q: Hm. Why? You don™t kn
ow. Wh at do you think? 
A: I don™t know. 
Q: Fashion? They wanted
 you to lo ok American? 
A: I wasn™t asked. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And all of a sudden I 
felt like a plucked chicken. 
Q: Yeah, I bet. 

A: And then  I went on the train. I don™t re
memb er if it was the same day or the next 
day, I went on a train with my  Aunt Bert
ha, Brocha, to go to  Co lumbus. And that™s 
where my new life started. When I came in, 
I mean she was so -- sh
e -- she was really a 
ver -- an extraordinary person. And the firs
t thing -- she was already living in a small 
apartment. They got rid of 
the house where things happen
ed, and where she lost her 
husband, whom I never met, my  Uncle Li
eber, Leonard. But she lived in a small 
apartment -- well, it w asn™t really small. 
There was a living room and a small dining 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
35
room and kitchen on one floor and then up
stairs there were two bedrooms and a bath. 
And one bathroom was Rosalie™s, one 
bedroom was Rosalie™s, my  cousin  -- 
Q: Your cousin? 

A: -- yes. Who™s also -- she looks a lit tle b
it like her mo m. She™s blonde, blue-eyed and 
very pretty. And Ro salie ha
d one bedroom and th en my Aunt Brocha and I had the 
other bedroom, where there were two single 
beds. The first months were very difficult 
for everyone concerned, for many reasons. My  aunt experienced a very tragic loss of 

her husband and she also lost her business 
that had to be built up from scratch. And 

then all of a sudden, I come in, in addition 
to her problems and -- financial and personal 
ones. And I my self needed love and I gue
ss peaceful surroundings. And unfo rtunately 
that couldn™t happen because 
of the circumstances. It wa
s very difficult for everyone. 
Q: She was work ing every day? 

A: Yes, oh yes. 
Q: So sh e would leave in the morning? 
A: Well, she would leave and after a little 
while, I would go to wo
rk with her and I 
became sort of a cashier. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I mean, that™s about the only thing I co
uld do because I didn™t
 speak the language. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
36
Q: Right. 
A: And I mean, numbers, you know, taking 
the payments, at that time, you know, 
people always -- not always, but they -- th
ere were no credit cards, they had -- you 
bought something, you paid a down  paym
ent and then  you made so many payments, 
you know, for a year or whatev
er. And I would do that in the -- in the store, in the 
office. 
Q: [indecipherable]. M m-hm. 
A: And so we would go. And also in the ve
ry beginning, my  aunt did an admirable 
deed. She threw me into school. 
Q: Right away? 
A: Right away. And I -- I didn™t speak -- I 
spoke many other languages, but I didn™t 
speak any English. And I cannot understand 
why I didn™t start learning English while I 
was waiting to go, you know, to 
emigrate, b u t I didn™t. And I came, as I said, I think the 
25
th
 of June, and after the Fourth  of July 
holiday, I was attending
 night classes a t 
Colu mbus Central High. And th ere again I 
was like a wild animal, because I didn™t 

speak a word of English. And -- but you know
, it was the best thin
g that happened to 
me. And I attended these classes u n til September 
and by then I went 
to Ohio State. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
37
by th at time I spoke some English and again, 
they were very helpfu
l. They gave me a 
tutor, for no money. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And I entered Ohio State w
ith a third grade education. 
Q: Wow. 

A: It was the best thing for me, but I work
ed  in the daytime and I attended school at 
night. And life was very difficult for my  aunt
, for me, for Rosalie, for the rest of the 
family. 

Q: Tell me about how many aunts and cousins a
nd wh at kind of -- what was the size of 
this family you were 
moving in to? I mean -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- were they a close family? Did they sp
end time together, and you know, wh at kind 
of -- 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- if you want to talk about that. 

A: Well -- 
Q: But I™m just trying to  get a sense of --  
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
38
Q: -- here you are, you don™t know anybody.  
A: That™s right. And I mean -- 
Q: And what were you -- what kind
 of wo rld were you co ming in  to? 
A: Well, it was like I was coming from Mars. A
nd part of it was my fault. But I had so 
mu ch pain and so mu ch  hurt
. I needed caressing and I need
ed love and understanding. 
And they, my family, in retu
rn needed some guidance too. Ho w to treat me, and -- you 
know, ho-how to react to me. 
And it didn™t come freely on e
ither side. In retrospect, it 
must have been terribly difficult for them, 
but it was also extremely difficult for me. 
Q: Were you in -- now that you™ve had 
these years to look back , what was your 

behavior like? Were you angry, were 
you short with  people? Were you -- 
A: No, I kept it all -- 
Q: -- what were you like, do you think? 

A: -- within me, and when -- on the way to
 school, I would cry. Wh en I was alone I 
would cry and I wasn ™t alone, 
I didn™t have any privacy, no
ne whatsoever. But that was 

out of my -- I -- I -- there was nothing I coul
d do about that. And my  aunt was so good 
and so caring -- 
Q: I™m sorry, we™re going to have to
 change tapes. Ho
ld that thought.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape two, side one, Charlene
 Schiff. Okay, your a
unt was very caring. 
A: Yeah, she was so caring and she was so fu
ll of love, and yet she was so hurt herself. 
I didn™t know -- didn™t know how to comfort her, and it f -- it almost felt that I sh ould 
comfort her, and it was sort of a mutual thi
ng, but then  there was my  cousin Rosalie. 

She was hurt because I was taking away part 
of her mother™s love, which was hers. And 
then all of a sudden she had to share it w
ith a stranger, and I was a stranger in every 
way. 

Q: And she had lost her father, too. 
A: And she had just lost her father and she 
was a very -- she was the only chi -- girl in 
that family, so her father both, and her mother
 adored her. And she was sort of lost, too. 
She needed comforting. And my  poor aunt wa
s torn. And it was very, very difficult. But 
to answer your question about 
the family, as it happened, th
e four other sisters of my  
father all lived in New York. 
And all of -- all the f -- the f
our sisters were married and 
each one had children. I became 
closest with Aunt Belka™s 
daughter, she had only one 
daughter, Rosalie also -- popular name in my
 family -- an d her fi
ancé, Stanley. And 
they -- eventually
 they -- they did marry, I think th
e same year. I became close with 
them because they were the 
ones who first greeted me when I first came here. Then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
40
there was -- there was Aunt Belka, then th
ere was Aunt Anya -- Anna, actually. She had 
two children, Toby and Jeff. A
nd then there was Aunt Ida, 
and sh e had three children, 
another Rosalie, Henry and Joe.
 So how many do we have 
now? Ida, Anya -- Anna -- 
Ida, Anna, Belka --  
Q: Bertha. 

A: Bertha. I™m missing one. Be five. Sarah. 
Aunt Sarah was the oldest of my father™s 
sisters and she had two children,
 Joe and Millie. Millie is stil
l alive. Millie must be now 
about 80 years old or so. Sh e is the daughter 
of the oldest aunt. But I was not very close 
with them because they were 
all in New York and they did 
not exchange frequent visits 
to Columbus. So basically th
e family would get together for different occasions like 
weddings, or Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, which I 
never knew about because this was a new 
happening for me, a new experien ce in the 
United States. But I was closest with my 
Aunt Bertha with whom I liv
ed, who open ed her home and heart to me and gave me 
unconditional love. Unconditiona
l love. And her children, sh
e had three children. She 
had two sons, Marty, the olde
st and Bobby. Bobby is no
w in  L.A.. He became an 
engineer and migrated, I think, a year or so  after I came to the States. Marty married 
and stayed in business with my aunt. And 
Rosalie was still a teen
ager. So I became -- 
and then there was -- also, there were some 
other relatives in Columbus. There was an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
41
Aunt Dora, and these were -- most of them 
were related to my Uncle Lieber. And they 
were very social, and I mean that™s the wa
y the family conducted itself. I mean, there 
were many parties and things like that. 
Q: So th ey kept 
you in their -- 
A: In -- yeah, but I --  

Q: -- in their [indecipherable] 
A: -- in the beginning I had no social life. 
Couldn™t speak English, and Rosalie was 
younger than I, and she had her own group. 
And usually wh en she and her childr -- her 

-- her friends would come, I™d go to the 
basement. There was a basement in the 
apartment. It was difficult. 
It was very difficult. My st
udies were progressing, I did 
quite well. I wanted so badly to  become 
Americanized. And I was attending school and 
I did very  well there, and I was still, you know,
 work ing at the store part-time. And my 
aunt tried her best to be my  friend and to
 be my -- my healer, 
in a way. But it was 
difficult. And then there was once -- and a -- I 
-- my social life was 
not very active, but 
I started -- I wasn™t dating, but I saw this yo
ung man, and at that time I was very, very 
naïve, I didn™t know anything. And I was me
eting him there after school or so -- or 
before, because I was going in  the evening.
 And now it comes out, I think, the only 
reason he dated me, he was majoring in  Ru ssian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
42
Q: He wanted to speak with you? 
A: And for me to help him in Russian. 
Q: Oh [inaudible] 
A: And so th at -- there was no ro mantic 
in -- you know, involvem
ent. But there was 
once a party, and the party was an Ohio Stat
e party, you know. I-I was -- I did belong to 
Hillel, but that was not from Hillel, was just 
a party, and a lot of the kids who came to 
the party, also there were some alumni 
who came. And my  husband had cousins in 
Columbus, twins. They were dentists. 

Q: Your future husband. 
A: My fu ture husband. 
Q: Right, okay. 

A: Yeah, th -- he had cousin s and they were 
twins and they were bo
th dentists and they 
were both alumni of Oh io State. As a matter 
of fact, they were my 
family™s dentists. But 
they came to that party because 
they were alumni of Ohio Stat
e, and at that time my f -- 
my  future husband visited th
em, and th ey brought him along. And that™s the way I met 
my  husband. I was playing hard  to get. My  husband is older than 
I am, but if I would 
line up a million men right now, I coul
dn™t have picked a better husband. 
Q: When you were at that party and you 
were introduced to him by so meone, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
43
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Did you hit it off right away -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- or did he see something -- 

A: He did, he kept purs
uing me and calling me and 
I played hard to get. 
Q: For how long? 
A: About three, four months. He was from 
New York and he came 
from a family, very 
nice family , he has one sister, 
and he had parents, 
obviously. He was in the military, he 
enlisted in the military when 
second World War started. And when the war ended, he 
got out. And he was sort of at loose ends, 
he didn™t know what to do with himself. He 
didn™t have a college education, so he starte
d going to  school and trying to see what he 
can do with himself. He had some kind of 
a job at that time in New York, but I don™t 
know why, but he came to visit, and lo ok 
around, maybe he was going to  go to Ohio  
State or whatever. And he came to  visit his 
cousins and it was, as they say in French 
[indecipherable], I guess. But once we star
ted dating, and our first date was around 
Thanksgiving, we knew -- I knew that this is
 what I wanted and I needed. And he has 
been blind since then, and doesn
™t see any of my faults, and 
I™m forever grateful. He is 
the best thing th at could have happened  
to me at any time, but especially then. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
44
Q: His name? 
A: Ed. But his actual name is Erwin, E-r-w-i
-n, which I don™t particularly like, because 
when  I say Erwin, I think of Erwin Ro mmel,
 the German general. So everyone calls 
him Ed. His -- his mother was German, she 
came from Germany. And her parents are 
his -- my  husband™s grandfather, Grandpa Ha
rkavy was a cigar manufacturer for the 
Kaiser in Germany. And they both, Baubi
 and Zedi Harkavy they come from th e 
famous Harkavys who -- some 
of these relativ es were wri
ting -- have written a prayer 
book, you know, for -- you know,
 for services and all. But 
he -- Zedi Harkavy had a -- 
as I said, a f -- a ma -- manufactured cigars
 for the Kaiser. And wh en I was introduced  
to Baubi and Zedi, and my husb -- my future
 husband said, you know, that I came from 
Europe and I was a Holocaust su
rvivor, I don™t think that th ey realized or wanted to 
believe that anything could have 
happened in  their beloved Germany. 
Q: Pardon me, but were they Jewish? 
A: Yes. 
Q: They were Jewish. 

A: Oh yes. 
Q: And when did they come to the U.S.? 
A: I™m not quite sure. A long time ago. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
45
Q: Well before the war? 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But my -- my mother-in-law,
 may she rest in peace, had 
one sister and her parents, 
but she -- they still spoke German occasionally
 with her sister. And that was difficult 
for me, too. 
Q: Yeah, I bet. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But you were in Colu mbus? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And they  were in New York . 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you weren™t seeing th
em on a regular basis. 
A: No, I wasn™t, and -- but that -- by the time 
we decide -- not by 
the time, actually we 
thought -- we didn™t set a date for the marri
age, for getting married, but as it happened, 
my husband was -- my future husband was in 
the reserves at that time, and he didn™t 
know if he was going to  go back  to school. 
He didn™t know what he really wanted. But 
we decided to get married and we didn™t 
set a date. And then the -- I think -- I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
46
recall exactly, but I think th e problem started 
with Ko rea, and he knew he was going to 
get called back because he was in the reserv
es. And so we did decide to get married. 
The date of our wedding wa
s set not by me. My mo ther-in-law and father-in-law and 
my  husband™s grandparents on both sides, I th
ink -- I know at least o n  one side, were 
married April 15
th
. And it was decided that E-Ed 
and I would get married April 15
th
. I 
did not have anything to
 contribute to that. The wedding 
was supposed to have been in 
Colu mbus, Ohio , my  aunt was going to  do that
. But, at the last min u te it -- the wedding 
took place in New York. My
 mother-in-law decided that Grandpa and Grandma 
Harkavy couldn™t travel, and the wedding ha
d to be in New Yo rk
. We got married -- 
Q: Was your aunt able to come from Columbus? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, she came and so me of
 the family. The aunts,
 my father™s sisters 
came. The wedding was in Franklin square in the s -- what is it, community center or 

something. And the rabbi who married us, 
I didn™t know him from beans, he was my  
mother-in-law™s rabbi. My husband -- at that 
time my  husband to be didn™t have mu ch 
to say about that either and we 
got married, and th at was wonderful. 
Q: Was this April after you met in November? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: So, like six months later. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
47
A: Yes, yes. We would have waited longe
r, but with the war -- 
it wa s, I guess, t h e 
Korea incident at that time. Well, su
re enough, we were married April 15
th
, I™m not 
going to  say wh at year, I™ll tell you later on. And May 12
th
 my husband was called back 
onto active duty. He knew he was going to  be
 called back. And his first assignment was 
Germany. And that did not sit very well 
with me and I guess I mu st have been a 
feminist way, way back, because
 even then I said
, I™m n o t going. And so  I -- at that 
time also my studies were interrupted beca
use I had -- I-I wanted -- I said I™m going to 
join you, you go. I mean, he 
had to go. But I™ll join you 
when I become an American 
citizen. Not that I wanted to 
go back to Germany anyway. 
And so I had to wait a year, 
but it was easier and shorter to go to New 
York to become a -- 
a citizen than in 
Colu mbus fo r some reason, I don™t understand
 why. So I went and 
stayed with my in-
laws until I beca -- and I -- I got a job at a 
candy store, a chocolate store, you know, 
while I was waiting. And my f -- my fathe
r-in-law, may he rest in peace, was a 
wonderful person. He accepted -- accepted me
 when my husband -- 
my future husband 
introduced me. He used to ca
ll me toots. And he said, toot
s, welcome to the family. And 
a -- a -- what -- yeah, if he -- if -- if, you kn
ow, Ed decided, and wh at he decides is good 
enough for me and gave me a big bear hug an
d he was a doll. He lived til 103. Oh, he 
was a f -- a wonderful person, I loved hi
m. He was such a wonderful person. Did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
48
everything wrong and yet he liv
ed til 103. He -- when he woul
d co me he would give me 
his orders. He liked steak and he liked a 
schnapps at night and he liked coffee, but 
actually it wasn™t coffee and it wasn™t half 
and half. It was heavy cream, about three 
quarters of the cup and then a 
little bit of coffee. And the steak
, h-he said, don™t trim the 
fat, because that™s the best
 part. But he lived til 103. 
Q: Wow. 
A: Yeah. A wonderful man. But anyway, I 
stayed with my in-l
aws and became an 
American citizen and then I went to join 
my  husband in Germany. This time when  I 
came back to Germany as an American citizen
, it was a lot different than living in DP 

camps. We went with  my  hu -- 
Q: Can I ask you a question befo
re we go back 
to Germany? 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Just what was it like in New York, and 
maybe even in Ohio? 
Did you know other 
survivors and -- and how are you ge
nerally regarded or considered? 
A: I was regarded as a -- lik
e in a zoo, what do you ca
ll it, when there™s someth ing 
strange or different. I was not regarded as
 a -- a regular human being. That™s -- 
Q: You felt like an outsider all the time. 

A: Always, yes. Oh yes, I have. And yes, I -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
49
Q: In New York  too? 
A: Oh, well first of all, they 
lived on the island, 
they lived in Frank
lin square, my in-
laws, and I -- 

Q: I don™t know where that is.  

A: It™s -- 

Q: The island meaning? 
A: The island meaning Long Island. 
Q: Long Island, okay. 

A: Yeah. I do -- I don™t know in New York re
ally, myself. That™s 
where they lived and 
all I knew, in the mo rning I would go into  -- I think it was Hamp stead or West 

Hampstead, to go to work
. Lufts, it was called , it was a -- like a -- lik e Bartons or so, it 
was chocolates, you know. And I would go to  wo
rk an d then I wo uld go back  at night. I 
didn™t go to school then  or anything. Just
 waiting and studying fo r my exam, you know, 
to become a citizen. It™s pre tty -- it was pretty -- not difficu
lt, but it was a lot. You had 
to learn history and -- you know. Bu t, you 
know, I passed and ev erything was fine. So I 
didn™t have any social life at that time 
either. And by that tim
e I was married and I 
couldn™t care less, you know? I would write to my  husband and -- almo st daily and so 

did he. And when the time came
, when I became an American
 citizen, I went back to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
50
Germany to  join my  husband.
 Now this is probably -- I don™t know how to express it, 
but becoming a wife of an officer -- o-o-of an
 ar -- of a -- of a military person, was the 
mo st important, wonderful thing that could ha
ve happened to me 
when I came to the 
United States. Why? Because all of a sudden I 
was part of a group. I finally belonged. I 
was a wife of a military person. And th
e military wives and all, accept you 
unconditionally, without reservations, without questions, you are one of them, and they  
take care of you. And I did not experi
ence anything like this until I married my  
husband, and until -- I mean, he wi -- became pa
rt of the military. And of course at that 
time it was also, ah, a nice Jewish guy, what
 is he doing in the 
military, you know? But 
at that point, and that™s also like -- almo
st like a Domino effect, my  husband went to 
Germany and he was to serve there three year
s and then  he would be out again, because 
he was in the reserves. But in order, since I 
didn™t go with  him, so it was a year or so 
before I became a citizen, an American citizen
 and was going to join him, so by that 
time he only had two years or 
so. And the military isn™t stupi
d. They  said, well, if you -- 
if you want to bring your wife over, you have
 to sign up for three more years. Yeah. Or 
something like that, I mean I™m -- I™m not 
quite sure. But anyway
, so my  husband had 
to sign up fo r another three years to serve in
 order to bring me to Germany. We -- we 
got some housing and all, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
51
Q: Where were yo
u in Germany? 
A: We were in -- outside of Munich. Rame
rsdorf, it™s -- it™s -- it was a post outside of 
Munich. And that -- at that 
time, you know, I became part
 of the military and we had 
meetings and I mean, there were so many thi
ngs to do and you ha
d to entertain and I 
didn™t know how to boil water. And there™
s one thing my  mo ther-in-law did th at I 
really, at th e time, like everyt
hing else, I didn™t appreciate, but
 she did a very nice thing. 
For the first Hanukkah after 
we got married, my  mo ther-in-law gave me a cookbook 
and rightly so, cause I didn™t
 know, as I say, how to boil water. She was a magnificent 
hostess. She -- and there was a large family, th
ey -- my father-in-law was one of 12, and 
my mother-in-law had a small family, but th
ey lived again -- also
, after they moved 
from Franklin square, they move
d to a very fancy place on 
the island with property on 
the water, right on the water and she ente
rtained beautifully, a
nd she -- people would 
come and visit like, you know, Sunday mo rni
ng, she™d say why -- why don™t you stay 
for dinner. And, you know, by
 the time she™d look
 around she™d have 25 people for 
dinner. And she would just do it as, you know, 
talking to  you or me. And I couldn™t do 
anything like that. But anyway
, she gave me this book and I was offended, but I really 
needed it because I didn™t know 
how to cook and how to ente
rtain. But when we did go 
to Germany, there were many obligations, y
ou know, I had to en te
rtain and -- and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
52
did get together, there was a lot of social act
ivity, and I was part of a group. And ev en 
though I hated being in Germany, and I m
ean, there were many instances where I never 
let on that I spoke German. And so many -- once
 my husband™s siste r came to visit and 
we went in, she wanted to buy some gifts. An
d there™s this fashiona
ble -- they still wear 
them, they call them lederhos
en, you know, the short -- sh
e wanted to buy so me. We 
went into a shop and this salesgirl, you 
know, was yelling back, an
d she says, these are 
Ammies, you know, Americans. How mu ch do 
I -- you know, what kind of price do I 
quote them? And they yelled back, telling 
them, you know, how much to ask, cause 
things were not marked. And then in my pures
t holk-deutsch I answered that if the price 
is different for the Ammies, we are not 
buying here. And we walked out, you know. 
That gave me great satisfaction. And I 
mean, there were many instances, you know, 
there that they didn™t
 like the Americans ev
en though we, you kn
ow, with the Marshall 
plan and everything, we did so much for theGermans, they still rese
nt -- that™s probably 
why they  resented us. And you would go
 and you would see signs, Ammie go home, 
you know. And that was in the 
50™s, but that™s the way it wa
s. But anyway, I was almo -
- I mean, I was -- I was becoming a different
 person, and it was very good for me. And 
so my husband signed up fo
r three mo re years and by th at time we came home and we 
ended up in several places, I can™t rememb
er where. I should remember. But anyway, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
53
we finally did have a son. An
d that was also after very di
fficult circumstances and this -
- I call him my miracle baby, we only have
 one son. And our liv
es changed and it was 
wonderful. My husband was tr
aveling quite a bit and many tim
es he had to go on duty 
without me, obviously. And so I had to lear
n, you know, how to 
do th ings for my self 
and all. But life was good. 
Q: What year was your son born ? 
A: He was born in 1956, so -- 
Q: And you were in the States then? 

A: When  he was born, yes. I had a very di
fficult pregnancy. And I reme mb er the doctor 
who took care of me in the military. He was 
born at Fort Lee, Vi
rginia and no matter 
where he was going to school since then, he
 was always referred to as the boy from the 
south. But th e doctor who to ok care of 
me, the obstetrician was getting out of the 
service, and he promised me that he™ll stay
 on, even a -- you know, if I don™t deliver on 
the date that, you know, he was -- actually
 had to get out like a week befo re my  
scheduled  delivery and he said
 he would stay on to see me through because I had a 
difficult pregnancy, and he did.
 And he said that the child
 would be born on September 
22
nd
 and he was born on September 22
nd
. But I went to the hosp
ital three times before, 
you know? And I reme mb er my  
husband was so excited that 
when th-the child finally 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
54
arrived and he was coming to the hospital, 
he had a box of cigars, you know, to hand 
out, he sp illed them all over the place. But th
ose were very good years. And then came 
Vietnam. And -- yeah ? 
Q: Your husband was still in the military? 

A: Well, after the three years that he signed 
up, then  he came back 
and he didn™t have a 
college education or anything 
and he decided to stay on. 
So he signed up for another 
three years. And by that time it was already ni
ne years or so, so he stayed on and he got 
his education too. He work ed at night and 
got his undergraduate degree and then  later 
on he got graduate degree, all 
while he was in the military. 
By that time he decided to 
make the military a career cause he s -- put in 
too much time into th
e military. And he -- 
actually he rose -- he became a full colone
l, you know, later on. But -- and that -- 

Q: Let me -- we™re almost out o -- on this
 side, let me turn this over before --

A: Is it on now? 

Q: Yes. This is tape two, side two, inte
rview with Charlene Sc
hiff. It™s the late 50™s 
now, your husband has decided to 
make the military a full career. 
A: Yes, bec -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
55
Q: And your son is a small -- 
A: Boy. 
Q: -- small boy. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And you™re where -- living where? 

A: We were living -- in ™56 we were living at
 -- living at Fort Lee, Virginia, which is 
just about I don™t know how many miles out
side -- south of Rich mo nd, Virg inia. And 
our son was born with some kind of 
a -- can I close this [inaudible] 
Q: Sure, just -- just start over. 
A: Well, our son was only three months old 
wh en my  husband got 
or-orders -- received 
orders to go to Japan.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the entire family was ou
traged. You™re going to take
 a little baby to Japan, in 
the wilderness? Well anyway, we
 did go to  Japan. Ou r son wa
s only three months old. 
When he was born there was so
mething a little bit -- that need
ed a doctor™s opinion and 
care. And I don™t know if you™ve ever hear
d of a famous docto
r from Pennsylvania, 
University of Pennsylvania 
in Philadelphia, he became the Surg eon General. Can™t 
remember his name, it™s terrible. But he™s 
a famous doctor and he became the Surg eon 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
56
General and now he™s a -- an activist. He ha
d a little beard, he™s usually in the news. 
Isn™t it terrible, I can™t remember his name. 
Q: Koop? 
A: Koop. Dr. Koop, yeah. D
r. Koop was recommended to us
, I mean, that we should 
see Dr. Koop with this little problem. And D
r. Koop, to see Dr. 
Koop you had to wait 
six to eight months to see him at that time, 
he was so busy. And we were at Fort Lee. 
Well some how, thro ugh a friend of a friend, 
Dr. Koop saw us right away, because we 

were going to go to -- 

Q: Japan. 
A: -- Japan. And usually, I don™t know how mu
ch he o -- he charged, but being th at my  
husband was military, and an 
officer, a young officer -- I 
mean, a ju nior officer, he 
charged us only 10 dollars to 
see our son. And he gave us 
the prognosis and he told us 
what to do and thank God everything
 turned out better than perfect. 
Q: Before we go to Japan, let me ask 
you sort of in a summary kind of way -- 
A: Mm-hm? 
Q: -- you™ve been in now -- in
 the States almost 10 years. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Just about 10 years. You™ve bi -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
57
A: Not quite, yeah. 
Q: Not quite 10 years, but you™re married
, you have a child, you™
ve been overseas, you 
-- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How -- an-and you said in the beginning 
when  you first started talking ab out your 
husband how understanding he was, how comf
orting he was to you at such a difficult 
time, but those first 10 years,
 how do you exp -- how -- h-how 
was it that he was able to 
understand, do you think,
 what you need ed and what you had to -- 
A: Because -- 
Q: Could he understand wh
at you had been through? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And did you find it easy to talk to him -- 

A: Yes, yes -- 
Q: -- and tell him what -- 
A: -- yes. 

Q: He knew  everything -- 
A: Yes, yes -- 
Q: -- about what had happened to  you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
58
A: -- everything -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- everything. As a matter of fact, before
 we became engaged, I -- we ha -- we s -- 
we had -- we sat up a whole ni
ght and I told him, and I sa
id, do you still want me? And, 
you know, he -- he is just a very -- again, I 
was so lucky. He™s a very special person, he 
has a big heart, and he -- he should have be
en  probably a psychiat
rist, I guess, because 
first of all he is very, very
 sharp, and he -- he has the 
understanding and he knows how 
to approach you and how to make you feel
 good ab out yourself. And there isn™t a day t-
til today that he doesn™t tell me 1 0  times that
 he loves me and I am the most beautiful 
creature in the whole world. I said, I just ho
pe he continues being blind for the rest of 
his life. And even  when he was so ill -- you know, he was very ill and I don™t want to 

go into it, but even when he was so ill, his main concern wa
s not to be a burden to me. 
So, I mean he -- somehow he has the right 
comb ination of making me feel like I™m the 
Queen of Sheba. I mean, I-I™m -- I™m rea
lly something, I™m 
important and he 
understands what I went through, or he -- if 
he doesn™t understand 
100 percent, he tells 
me with his love and with his actions that 
he does. And he makes me -- I -- I -- I can tell 
him anything and ev erything. An
d he is soft and wonderful.
 And yet, as a soldier and 
all, he was hard and he was decisive and -- 
and he was mean when he had to  be mean, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
59
but he has never been  mean to me . And I™m 
a very difficult person to live with, maybe 
part of it because of what I went through,
 but I -- I am difficult,
 and I know it. And 
sometimes I would start an argument, and 
the mo st frustrating thing is, he never 
answers. He doesn™t want to argue. He doesn
™t want to have an argument. And a -- it™s 
sometimes exasperating to me, but he doesn ™t 
want to argue with me. He says he had 
enough arguments. And, you know, so he -- he
 just -- he™s just a v ery special person. 
And a -- a -- I™ve been just very
, very fortunate. And I think 
he got most of all this from 
his father. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Cause his father was a very gentle pe
rson, a very loving pe
rson, a very caring 
person. He was one of 12. I don™t know ho
w many ended up here in  the Un ited States 
and all, but mo st of them, not all of them, 
have done extremely well financially. Not my  
father-in-law. He was actually a builder, 
you know. But money and my  father-in-law 
just didn™t go hand in hand. 
It always went away from him. I mean, he made a living, 
but nothing extraordinary. And yet, during th
e war he had a big gard en and after work 
and all he would co me -- he was always a ha
rd wo rker, and he wo uld, you know, grow 
all these w o nderful vegetables and everyt
hing. And on Sundays th
e whole family, the 
real rich ones, you know, who could afford
 anything and everyt
hing would co me and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
60
load their cars with all the ga
rden  vegetables and fruits th
at my father-in-law worked 
on. And they  wouldn™t ev
en say thank you. So  -- 
Q: Were you and your husband religious? Did you -- 
A: Yes. There again, when I -- when the 
war ended, I was angry and disappointed and 
hateful and I lost my faith. I always say I™v
e had one-sided di -- a one-sided dialog with 
God, cause he never answered. And I felt al
most abandoned by God. Our back ground -- 
I -- I don™t know wh at I said in my oral hist
ory before, but I think I probably  said that 
we weren™t kosher. 

Q: You did mention that. 
A: I did. I think we were kosher, but -- at 
home, but wh en we wo
uld go out, I think -- 
or, you know, there weren™t that many restaura
nts, but in -- in Lvov, I mean was a big 
city, my father would allow us to have a sa
ndwich with  chicken, an d I know it wasn™t 
kosher, you know, so I -- you know, we were re
ligious at home, but not as Orthodox as 
most other people. My father never wore 
a yarmulke un-unless he went to shul. So 
when -- now I was sort of at loose ends, I 
think, and when I came
 to Columbus, there 
were the rituals; Friday night, and my aunt 
would go to shul on 
Saturday -- not every 
Saturday  -- and the holidays were observe
d, you know, with traditional food an d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
61
traditional whatever else there was. But wh
en  I married my  husband we had a tradition 
-- a traditio n -- we had a -- a religious mar -- 
Q: Service [indecipherable] 
A: -- wedding, yeah. And we al
ways belonged -- in the milita
ry we always belonged to 
the chapel, to the Jewish ch
ap el. And ag ain, it wasn™t something th at my  husband 
would, you know, use the what
 do you call them, the Tef
illin, you know, he wouldn™t 
do th at. But we preserved the traditional 
way of observance, I suppose. And then  

something happened  in  1985. I don™t 
know, am I ready for that? Not yet. 
Q: Well, we™re jumping ahead a little bit, but -- 
A: Yeah, so -- 
Q: -- if you think it™s relevant here, it™s [indecipherable] 

A: Well, i-it™s relevant to th -- becaus
e that™s when I rega
ined my faith --  
Q: Oh right, right. 
A: -- completely, yeah. But I started regain
ing my faith when my son was born. And 
also, it was very important to both of us 
that our son get a very thorough Jewish 
education. That was very important to us. An
d it started with the birth of our son, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, we™ll co me back to that later. 
A: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
62
Q: Because I think it -- it™ll be interesting to 
talk about in -- in re
latio n to your decision 
to speak out, too, in those times.  
A: Yeah, i-it™s all sort of -- 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s -- yeah. So let™
s go so rt of chronologically -- 
A: So where are we now? 

Q: We™re -- you™re going to Japan. 
A: Yeah. Well, we™re going to  Japan. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And again, I know my  daughter-in-law, 
God bless her, sh-she™s a nurse -- my -- my 
husband -- my  husb -- my  son is a doctor, so 
who else would he marry? A nurse. But -- 
because it takes a special person to underst
and a doctor, you know
. But anyway, she -- 
when  she sometimes hears about -- listens to
 our co nversations no
w she says, I could 
never be a military wife. And I can see that, 
you know, but for me, again, I think I said 
it before, it was the best thing that ever ha
ppened to me. But I had to learn -- well, I 

didn™t have to, because I was used to it, but 
you have to take the bitter with the sweet. 
Going to Japan was an -- an occasion for us
 very exciting, but the whole, the entire 
family, mine and my  husband™s was very mu
ch against it. I mean
, they voiced their 
opinion. You™re taking a little babela, a littl
e baby to the wilderness, you know. Well 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
63
anyway, we set out to go to  Japan. We had 
to go to th e state of Washington, I don™t 
know where we left from, someplace there. It
 was a military place and that™s where we 
went. And what happens usually
 w -- in the military, and es
pecially when you have a 
child, when you go overseas -- at
 that time we didn™t have mu
ch in -- as far as furniture 
and all, but we had a little bit of stuff. And so
 when the packers came 
to pack us -- they 
call it hold luggage, hold baggag e and regula
r baggage. The hold 
baggage is supposed  
to come right after you arrive in the new co
untry, cause that™s th e st uff that you cannot 
do without. So wh at could I not do without? I 
needed a crib, I needed diapers, and in 
those days you had diaper that
 you had to wash, and all the 
things that I 
needed for my 
son, right, and a few things 
for us. And -- and that™s the 
way it -- so that was our hold 
luggage and the rest was going to
 come later. When we -- well,
 first of all, we boarded -
- is that what you call it, boarded  a-a -- the 
ship, and right away 
the military has their 
own way. So, it was in the winter time when
 we went, and my  hu
sband was cal led to 
duty on the ship, to be with
 the troops, downst -- down there in the -- in the deep 
whatever you call it. 
Q: In the hold, yeah. 
A: In the hold, yeah . And Stephen, our son,
 and I, the three month old baby and I were 
someplace else upstair -- up in a little cabin, a 
very small cabin. The weather was so bad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
64
that they had to tie the mil 
-- th-the little thing that they
 had for my son -- it wasn™t 
really a crib, but some kind of a thing be
cause it was going back and forth. And me, I 
got sick, you know, again. And my s -- my 
husband was down with 
the troops, so we 
had no care except for the peop
le who, you know, care for you, th-the waiters or 
whatever you call them. And th
is was a mi lit ary ship, so we had some nurses a nd all. 
By the time we got to Japan, I mean, I c
ouldn™t wait to see the 
ground, to feel the 
ground, you know, under my  feet. And as a --
 as we came, my husband at that time was 
already a specialist in petrol
eum, you know, all the oils 
and all the petroleum for the 
cars and for the airplanes. And at that time 
he was in charge of the petroleum for all 
Japan. And we came in, there was no housing 
for us. Usually there is, but there wasn™t. 
They  need ed  him right away. And we were
 assigned a house on a 
depot, the only house 
there. So there I come with my little boy in  
a house with no other 
houses around. And I 
was assigned a little Japanese girl to help 
me, like a lit t le maid. Lovely young lady. She 
didn™t speak English and I didn™t speak Ja
panese. And the water had to be boiled and 
we had to  put Clorox in  it because it wasn™t
 safe in those days
. And our hold baggage 
didn™t come. So it was a very hard first ye
ar. And my  husband wh
en he -- we finally 
arrived in Japan, he was called t -- mine -- to
 -- to be in charge of a big petroleum lab 
which was near Yakuska. We -- I was in Yok
ohama, he was in Yakuska, and then there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
65
was a little island by itself and that™s where th
e big lab was, and my husband had to go 
there. So for the first y ear I hardly saw him.
 And the thing th at real
ly scared me, I mean 
you learn and you do, 
you know, what you have to do, 
and th e baby was being cleaned 
and all with water that we had to boil and we
 had to put Clorox in
. And my little helper 
would co me every day and we sort of, yo
u know, communicated. And she had to go 
and buy me diapers in a Japanese place, and 
we had to get a crib from somewhere. And 
somehow we, you know, managed. But the fu
nny thing was, she has never eaten wh ite 
bread. [coughs]. Excuse me. She was used to
 a diet of rice. [coughs]. And -- sorry. 
Q: It™s okay.  
A: And when she came to me, I mean, once a 
month I could write out an order and the 
commissary would deliver it to me. When 
-- you know, because my  husband wasn™t 
around. We didn't have a car 
or anything. So  when  she was introduced to wh ite bread, I 
was using a loaf of bread almo st daily becau
se she just loved the wh ite bread, which 
you know, was fine. And sh e wa
s very anxious to come and 
work  with me because of 
the white bread. Nothing else 
appealed to her as much as
 white bread. But anyway, 
Formikasan was her name. Very lovely young 
girl. We wanted to  bring her back with 
us when our time was to come home from Ja
pan. Bu t to show you -- and there I™m 
mixing apples and oranges, but 
to show you what a custom th
ey have in these countries, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
66
in Japan, for instance, she was one, I think of six, but she was the oldest daughter, the 
oldest child in the fami ly, and sh e wouldn™t 
go with -- I mean, we told her, if you co me 
with us to America, you™ll have a better life,
 you know, you™ll go 
out and do, you know, 
what you want to do. She -- by that time she 
learned English a little bit, and she wanted 

to go to America badly, but she, being th
e eldest in the family, sh -- it was her 
assignment, her task to take care of her pare
nts. So she couldn™t -- unless we would take 
her parents, and of course we
 couldn™t do that. Now, co ming ba
ck to Japan. For the first 
year, was very difficult, but our son thrive
d and he gained weig
ht, and it -- you know, 
for me it w as a full time -- fu
ll time and a half of -- of, 
you know, taking care of him, 
and without my  husband™s help  and in  a stra
nge co untry without knowing the language 
and the cu stoms. There was one thing that occu
rred at that time that is -- I think I should 
mention. I was introduced to something calle
d typhoon. They  have typhoons and this is 

like a hurricane, I-I think on a grander scale,
 cause you know, Japan is like an island. 
And anyway, we had this typhoon and I mean,you have to prepare 
yourself and all -- 

everything was closed and all. 
And I was still in that one ho
use on the depot, there were 
no other houses. But the mili
tary, they would call me, a
nd some of the wives would 
come, you know, and lend a help ing hand. And 
th ere again you go, I did not feel very 
abandoned. But the typhoon wa
s very, very difficult because there was no -- there is no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
67
-- there are no basements in that area, and th
is is the area of Yokohama. And the house 
was a not a very, I guess, sturdy house. But we lived through it, was about three or four 
days, but in the middle of the typhoon, I did get a -- I had a telephone. I did get a 
telephone call from one of my  comp atriots wh
o lived already in the American section, 
which we later did get housing and we join
ed. And she called me to let me know that 

my husband was killed in the typhoon. He 
was on a boat because his lab was on a little 
island off Yakoska. Yakoska is a port, and wealways used to make fun th at everything 

was classified, but you go to 
Yakoska because you know, it is
 a -- a -- what do you call 
it, port city, and on all the bars and all it sa
ys, welcome the Enterpri
se. In other words, 
Enterprise the ship is arriving. It was suppos
ed to be classified, but they na -- knew it 
all. Well an yway, this friend called me to sa
y that my husband was killed. He drown -- 
his little boat that he was going from the lab,
 he was trying to come back home, and 
then the boat capsized and 
he drowned. And for about 
tw o days I didn™t know any 
different cause the typhoon was still raging. An
d of course, thank God, it was a mistake.  

Q: Oh my God. 

A: It happened twice actually, in
 -- in Japan, you know. But -- 
Q: Wow. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
68
A: -- so anyway, but finally we did get housi
ng on the -- they called it Nagishi Heights, 
and we moved there. It was a very nice house
. Very interestingly, the house bordered a 
-- it was an enclosed area where mo -- not mo
stly, where all the American military and 
their wives lived. And the house was a subs
tantial house, but it bordered a Japanese 
cemetery. And every day you™d go to  the liv
ing room window, lo
ok out and you would 
see from th e fences and all, eyes staring at 
you, and that was -- these were the Japanese 
people, they were just curiou
s. At -- in the cem -- at th
e cemetery, looking into our 
windows. But it was a very interesting experience being in Japan. 
Q: Let me ask you a question about that. Was 
there any sense of irony fo r you to  be in 
Japan as an American, as the conqueror of Japan -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- when you had been a Holo
caust survivor, and on the -- 
A: You™re very perceptive. 
Q: -- receiving end -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- of that experience. 
A: Yeah, yes. 
Q: What was that -- it must have been -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
69
A: Was a good feeling. It was of -- I cannot 
describe it, but I was -- and I am, I guess, I 
-- I was a v ery good military wife, and I triedto do everything by 
the book. And just to 
give you an example even then
, I mean, I felt empowered. I did. But of course there was 
always the worry about your 
husband, you know, and I m
ean he had to fly out to 
different countries and all and I 
-- and that™s the army, the mili
tary life is that th ere are 
many separations. But the one th ing I rememb er -- and I mean, we were told you have 
to give so many cock tail par
ties and all that. And I rememb
er my first party when we 
moved to  Nagishi Heights. It was to be a pa
rt -- I can™t remember 
what our holiday was 
or whatever. And I said, oh yes, I™ll give a 
party. At that time I™ve learned how to cook 
and how to serve the right things, but I lik
ed to  have the wives also. Because the 
Japanese businessmen, and this -- these were
 mostly the people 
who had all these oil 
factories -- I mean, not the fact
ories, what do you call it? 
Q: Refineries. 

A: The refineries. And I mean he -- th-these
 are the -- the highfalutin people in Japan. 
Q: Very wealthy families. 
A: Yes, very wealthy families. And I said, 
I will not invite them unless I get p ermission 
to invite the wives. And th is was unheard of
 in Japan because thei
r system is where the 
wife goes three steps behind, even today. A
nd I mean, I felt I had my rights, and I felt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
70
empowered to do that. And I said, I™m an American and in our society, the man come 
with their spouses. And they allowed me 
to do that. And I -- I -- I would say that I 
probably  established the first of -- I guess,
 way of including th e wives. Because when  
we went to the Japanese affairs, there were
 never any wives. There were Geisha girls, 
who were assigned to en tertain the men and th
e women, because we were invited. And I 
mean, we would have a Geisha, and I mean 
she would -- I mean, it was clean fun, but 
very sexist. I mean, in the se
nse that the wife is subservi
ent and th e Geisha is supposed 
to amuse me, you know, with some stupid th
ings. It was very -- I™m sorry. No, but th-
the set-up was that the wife did not count. 
And the Americans -- they had to suffer and 
they had to invite the American
s -- they didn™t have to, but th
ey did. And they were sort 
of tolerated. That™s the way I felt with the 
Japanese. But when I invited the wives, the 
spouses of these business people, I™ll tell 
you, every one of them
 came. They were 
dressed in their mo st beautiful kimonos, th
-their outfits, their national, you know, 
outfits are magnificent. Each one brought an 
exquisite gift. And they were so thankful. 
And from then on, an y time I entertained, wi
ves were always included, and they knew 
it. And other women took the le
ad from my  lead, and they started doing the same thing. 
And I felt very empowered, very good about 
what I accomp lished there. And the wives 
were elegant and lovely  and dain ty and very
, very grateful. And th -- we™ve kept in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
71
touch with quite a few of them, because to 
them it was just an -- 
a w o nderful treat. We 
were invited once to the -- to Emperor Hi
rohito™s birthday party, and that was a 
wonderful, wonderful experience. 
Q: In Tokyo? 

A: Yeah, to -- Yokohama and T-Tokyo is 
not very far from Yokohama. And I have 
made a policy -- or I mean, I don™t know if 
it™s because of my  experiences but wh en we 
go overseas or when we go anyplace, a lot 
of Americans live in 
an American ghetto. 
They live in their assigned hou
sing. They  go and exchange 
parties or play bridge, you 
know, which, you know, we d
on™t, for many reasons. But they stick to their own. And I 
feel that™s wrong. When y
ou go someplace and -- wh ere you™re assigned, you are a 
representative, you™re an am
bassador of your country to
 the country that you are 
visiting, because that™s all 
you™re doing, you™re vi -- you ar
e a visitor, and you should 

show your best side. And we ha
ve tried to absorb the culture, 
to go to Kabuki, to go to 
the museums, to mingle with the -- with the Japanese. And I felt that it was, in a way 

your mind doesn ™t become st
agnant and you acquire an 
awful lot of knowledge, and 
you enjoyed a -- a -- you know, just -- as we
ll. So there are many, many, you know, 
positive things that come from 
living oversi -- overseas, but 
you have to be willing to 
give of yourself and to represent your
 co untry in the best way possible. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
72
Q: Do you think that your desi
re to mingle with local people was also s -- driven in part 
by your experience as a survivor, where you
 were ghettoized, and 
you had su ffered the 
consequences of that kind of 
thinking before, and so you we
re feeling some insistence 
on people of different cultures --  
A: Of di -- maybe so, I never -- 

Q: -- mingling -- it wasn™t conscious then . 
A: Yeah, I don™t think it was conscious, but 
you have a very good point, and boy are 
you perceptive. Yeah, I -- I am sure that had some -- I™ve always been surround -- I 
wanted to  surround myself with people. No
w, as my -- you know, as I™m getting older, 
in the golden  years, I enjoy 
solitude. I am never bored with
 myself, I don™t have enough 
time to myself. But in those days, yes, it wa
s wonderful to be surrounded by people and 
especially of a different culture and to 
learn. And I mean, I knew the background, I 

knew the history and it™s alwa
ys, you know, maybe I didn™t 
know as mu ch, but I knew, 
I mean they -- they were the 
perpetrators and they were ve
ry cruel and th-then I learned 
about the Shanghai Jews, wh
o survived in Shanghai. 
Q: Mm-hm.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
A: -- about Japan. 
Q: [indecipherable] about Japan. This is ta
pe three, side one, of
 Charlene Schiff. You 
were talking about the ps
yche of the Japanese. 
A: They -- they™re very inscru
table, is there such a wo rd? You never know what they 
really think. They always have a smile on their face, and they wo
uld say yes, they -- 
they hate to say no. It™s like yes, we have 
no bananas. And it™s true. But we have made 
some wonderful friendships ther
e. My husband had a very  loyal crew. He needed to 
depend a lot on the Japanese because -- and this
 was all classified stuff, with the testing 
of all the jet fuels and all. And he had a 
very  responsib le job th
ere. And we™v e made 
many friends among the military. And as a matte
r of fact, that™s w h ere I first took up 
Chin ese cooking. I -- Chin ese, and that™s Ja
pan. What was happening, there were two 
Benedictine sisters in Tokyo, an d they we
re stranded during the 
war. They came from 
China, they were working in 
China, Americans. And they  were stranded in Japan with 
no in come, no way of making a livelihood. 
And so  they opened a school for the 
military, for the -- all the m
ilitary in -- in the area, a
nd started teaching Chinese 
cooking. And th ese schools became so famo
us that all the embassy people, you know, 
wanted to -- it wa -- it took about a year or
 so to go th rough th e course. I had to wait a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
74
full year to be able to f -- 
you know, to enroll. And they 
came out with a little booklet 
of -- well, a little cookbook where they ad
apted the Chinese recipes to American 
consumption. And th ey were so much fun an
d it was a fantastic experience. For a whole 
year I took this cooking co
urse. And they -- they -- we 
corresponded until they passed 
on. But it was very well known in the embassy 
and all, all the wives were just waiting, 
you know, to attend this. Then 
I also took cor -- courses in flower arranging. I tried to, 
you know, get mo re cultu
re, what have you. 
Q: Ikebana. 
A: Ikeban a, that™s right. And I was learni
ng, and th at I took fo r three years. And I 
passed, now I have a Japanese professional name, and I became an instructor, and don™t 

ask me to arrange two flowers now, cause 
I don™t know how. Bu t I mean, the lines and 

all, it™s very, very precise, and very exact
. And I attended these classes for three years 
and I came back home and that all of a sudd
en -- I did know th at you don™t need a 
dozen  roses to make an arrangements, can 
ma ke it -- an arrangement, you can make it 
with one rose. And I enjoyed th at very much. We attended ka
buki and we traveled quite 
a bit. It was a good time, yes. 
Q: What were the years that you were in Japan? 
A: It was ™56 when my
 son was born, til ™60. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
75
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And then  -- let me  ask you one thing ab
out Japan. Was your being a survivor an  
issue in any way with  anyone? 
With you, or with any of 
the other Americans that you 
knew -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- or with the Japanese? And was that okay -- 
A: The Japanese couldn
™t -- wouldn™t know, no. 
Q: And was that okay with you, was it -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- [indecipherable] knew -- 

A: No, actually, when I married 
my husband it see ms like  I we
nt into a different world, 
and I had no connection with su rvivors, not 
at all. And I mean, I didn™t know anyone. I 
-- I did keep  in touch with my  friend Sonya 
in Du luth  and -- and of course with my  
family in Columbus and 
New York . Bu t no, I had no 
co nnection with any other 
survivors. And you know what? That was good -- 
Q: You think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
76
A: -- at that time, yes. I need
ed that. I -- when I married my
 husband I felt that -- and I 
mean when I came here, I wanted to become 
Americanized overnight. And that desire 
didn™t leave me and when I met my  husband 
and when we married, I wanted him to be 
proud of me and not to be referred as 
the greener. And you know wh at a greener 
means? A greener means the -- the -- when
 you™re green means your -- you™re a -- a 
stranger. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And they  always say the greener couz
ina. The couzina™s lik
e a cousin . And in 
Yiddish it™s the greener couzina, it means th
e -- the stranger who doesn™t know how to  
pick up a fork, you know. I -- 
I wanted to become Americaniz
ed and I didn™t feel that 
until I became Mrs. Erwin H. Schiff. And I-I don™
t know, but in Japan I don™t think -- if 
anyone was aware of it, they didn™t question 
it, they didn™t treat 
me any differently. I 
was one -- we did make friendship a lo -- a lo
t of friends. We met friends in Japan and 
we have one couple, the husband just died 
in -- suddenly. But we™ve been friends since 
Japan and they are Jewish. He was a lawyer 
and he had open heart 
surgery. The surgery 
was a success, then he got an infection, 
you know, wh at do you call it, that horrible 
thing, and he died. And -- a
nd his wife and my husband an
d I are still dear friends and 
we keep in  touch almo st on a daily basis. 
She lives part-time here and part-time in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
77
Newport, Rhode Island. But -- and we met in
 Japan. So we were active there in the 
chapel, in the Jewish chapel
 and we had several Bar Mitz
vahs and all that took place 
there. So -- but nobody ever ma
de an issue of where I come from. I was -- what was he 
at that time, I think a major -- M ajor Schiff™s wife, Charlene. 
Q: Well, military is -- 

A: Militar -- 
Q: -- an equalizer. 
A: That™s right, the great equalizer. And 
I mean, sometimes you wonder how things 
happen. I mean, a Jewish boy
, they kept saying, a Jewi
sh boy going th-the military, 
making a career out of it? It™s unheard of. 
And -- and coming ba -- well no, we haven™t 
reached Vietnam yet, have we? 

Q: No [indecipherable] 

A: Not yet. But yes, it was the great equaliz
er for me, and it was the best thing that 
could have happened  to  me. My daughter-in-
law, as I said, said she could have never 
been a military wife. But I mean, the hardsh ip
 that come -- th-that 
-- the hardsh ips that 
come with -- with being in 
the military are many. And I m
ean, the moving around -- our 
son was in 17 different schools be
fore he attended high school. 
Q: Wow. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
78
A: Yeah, he -- didn™t hurt him one bit. He ente
red he -- he -- his -- he went to Princeton. 
Then , you know, he went to medical school. Did medical school in th ree years, then 
trained in har -- at Harvard for his specia
lty, urology for seven 
years. And now, you 
know, is in private practice, and teaches pa
rt time in Brown. And 
when he got out from 
Harvard he was in -- at Yale as a -- on the 
staff and faculty of the medical school. So it 
didn™t hurt him, not at all. But you mix the 
bitter with the sweet, and it™s an experience. 
And it takes a special person to be a good ar
my -- a m -- a military
 wife. And in the 
early years it seemed that the 
wife doesn™t have mu ch to sa
y. You go wh ere the husband 
has to si -- to -- to go. And that is still tr
ue. But yet, you can le
ave your mark. You can 
do th ings that you want to do.
 When  I established this pr
ecedent, I mean, it wasn™t 
happening until then that the wi
ves, the Japanese wives were invited to cocktail parties 
and all. It was a fantastic achievement and I™m still proud of it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So, you know, there ar
e pros and cons and -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- for me it was good. 
Q: Yeah. So you came back
 to this -- did you come
 stateside in 1960 -- 
A: Yeah, we came back
 to the States -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
79
Q: -- and this is -- you -- you had -- 
A: -- yeah. 1961. 
Q: -- all this is -- you men
tioned the era of Vietnam. 
A: Yeah, well Ed, at that time 
I think he was assigned to Fort
 Lee again. No, I think he 
was assigned not -- yes -- no, to the Pentag on. 
But at the Pentagon he was only, I think, 
a year. And then we went to Fort Lee again.
 And then -- I can™t re
member exactly what 
year -- we were active at Fort Lee, that
™s the quartermaster 
headquarters. And my  
husband was still with petroleum and all, but
 he was at Fort Lee, you know, assigned 
permanently to Fort Lee, Virginia, but he sp
ent an awful lot of tim
e at the pentagon. So 
again I -- he™d go for two we
eks and co me back maybe fo r three days. And so it was, 
you know, that I was there for 
my s -- for our son. We were 
very much involved there, 
at Fort Lee with the Jewish
 chapel. And that™s where we met a very wonderful man, 
Rabbi Elster. Rabbi Elster was serving the 
military, his -- what was it, two or three 

years, and then was going to 
get out and be a rabbi in the civilian world. We became 
fast friends, Rabbi Elster and Shulamit Elst
er, and now they have
 three married kids. 
But our friendship started at Fort Lee. My 
husband was at Fort Lee and th en he got 
orders for Vietnam. I think it was 1964, and 
between Fort Lee and -- and the Pentagon, 
you know, and some other pla
ces that he would go like for six weeks and come back. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
80
When  he was assigned to Vietnam the firs
t time, in 1965, was the beginning of our 
involvement. Well, the military
 involvement. I think theyhad advisors and all earlier. 
But in 1965 my husband was ca
lled on to go to Vietnam. He
 was very much against our 
involvement in Vietnam, and wh
en he got -- but he was in 
the military and they ordered 
him, so he went. He expressed his, I guess hi
s views to the higher ups, and he wasn™t 
the only one, because he said, this is a kind of
 war that we cannot win, because we are 
trained to conduct a -- a re -- what do you call 
it, a -- a regular war, and these people are 
not terrorists, but they are guerillas and they
 were fighting the war in Vietnam from the 
underground. They had th -- we
 went to Vietnam just five
 years ago, and I saw these 
tunnels and all. They were 
fighting ev erything from the un
dergro und. And my  husband 
and several -- and other people, the younger, th
e younger officers sa id this is ki -- the 
kind of war it cannot be won. 
But of course, they didn™t lis
ten to them. But, when my  
husband got orders to Vietnam, I decided in  
my infinite wisdom -- I™m being sarcastic -
- to go to Columbus, to stay 
in Colu mbus. Why? Because I had family there, my  aunt 
was still there. I -- so I rent
ed an apartment near where sh
e lived, and enrolled my son, 
at that time I think he was in third grade, 
and he had his cousins there, you know. I say 
cousins, but they were my  cousins, but he 
co unted them as his cousins. And we lived 
the year that my  husband was in Vietnam 
in Columbus, Ohio. Was a miserable year. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
81
Why? Everybody th at I knew and everybody wh
o knew me was always asking, what is 
your husband doing in Vietnam? 
Why didn't he go to Canada? 
Q: Oh. 
A: Because some of these people went to Ca
nada. And I even got into a fight at an 
airpor -- at the airport. And there were 
some young people picketing, you know, and 
protesting the war. And at that time I felt 
my husband is there, I didn™t know th e 
situation, but his country, right or wrong. 
And he™s serving his country, he™s there. And 
I didn™t like the way they propr -- they we
re protesting and scre
aming, you know, and 
cursing an d all, and I slapped one guy in th e fa
ce. I almost ended up in jail. But that was 
my  experience you know, in -- in Colu mbus. 
It was not a good experience. And after 
that, when my husband came back -- and that -- 
that first year was also very -- I did get 
a call that my husband was killed and that wa
s -- he was assigned again with petroleum. 
All the oils and the jet fuels and all for -- fo
r the entire area. And at that time he -- the 
headquarters were in Saigon an
d they were -- there was a bi
g inter -- there was a -- a -- 
a big explosion, it was all over the news, and in
 a great hotel -- I forgot the name of the 
hotel, and a lot of Americans lost their lives
. As it was, my  husband had a meeting at 
that ho -- in that hotel with some generals
 and all, I don™t know what it was, and he 
wrote me daily, and -- that first year that he was in Vietnam. And he told me he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
82
going to  be, you know, in Saint Regis, I thi
nk, hotel on Tuesday of whatever. That -- 
the letters would go about a we
ek or so, and that Tuesday wh
en he was supposed to be 
there, they had a big ex -- 
they bombed the -- 
the guerillas, the hotel and -- and you 
know, there were a lot of casualties. And I 
called the Red Cross to find out what was 
happening, and they  -- that™s why I™ll never 
give another penny to the Red Cross -- and 

they called me back that my husband was k
illed. And as it happene
d, my husband was 
in the hotel and left five minutes before th
e explosion. So, you know, lucky fo r me and 
for him. When he came back from Vietnam 
he was smoking something like two packs 
of cigarettes a day. He was, I think, bone 
-- skin and bone and hi
s hands were shaking. 
He -- he was a mess. V ery -- I mean, physica
lly very frail. He was a young man at that 
time. And it wa -- it w as very sad to watch. 
And th en when he came, with the reception 
he got in Columbus was just
 absolutely dem-demo ralizing. His next orders were to 
work with the chiefs of sta
ff and the Joint Chiefs of Staf
f at the Pentagon. And so he 
ended up wo rking in  the Pent
agon, and we bought our firs
t and only modest house in 
Springfield, Virginia, which is a suburb he
re. And that was the first time that our 
Stephen, our son, went to the same  school tw
o years in a row. And he work ed in -- in 
the Pentagon. I never saw him because mo st 
of the time the hours were mi serable. But 
he kept on saying th at, you know, he and 
other young -- they called them the young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
83
Turk s -- kept saying that Vietnam is some
thing we should never have gotten involved  
in. Well, lo and behold, in 1969 he got or
ders to go back to Vietnam to the same 
petroleum job. But this time he was going to
 Play Ku , wh ich is the mountainous area. 
And he -- this time he had hi
s own chopper and he had to 
supply the fuels not just for 
Vietnam, but for the en tire area of all the c
ountries around, a very 
big job. And he had 
to -- actually had to build the pipes and all th
at go. And there again, he spent a -- a year, 
that was -- had many close calls. Once the --
 the chopper that he was in -- he had a 
pilot, he didn™t pilot it himself, b u t it was -- 
there was an explosion. All the buttons on 
his shirt were ripped off and he came out w
ith a s -- without a scratch. And there were 
several -- and then, I mean, he 
worked so hard. And it wa -- a
nd th en they  had to go into 
Cambodia, which was a classified thing, I 
wasn't supposed to 
know about it, and all 
that. Finally, thank God, he came back. He 
came back and he was assigned -- and again, 
he had several very big arguments with 
his superiors. He, a
nd other young men, 
officers. And they were, of course they we
ren™t listened to. And he
 ended up again at 
the Pentagon. And at that time they promis
ed him a star. H e was going to become a 
general if he would give up 
his ideas about Vietnam. He couldn™t do that. And that™s 
when  he retired. In a way as a protest, you 
know. And then he went to wo rk, you know, 
different places and all. And at that time, after he retired, we decided to make our home 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
84
here, to stay where we -- we still had th
e little house, and our son was a big man on 
campus in high school here. And he went to  
work for a -- an associ
ation, my  husband. 
And at that time, in 1983, I think we had th
e first Holocaust survivors meeting here in 
Washington, and I attended it. Meanwhile, and then at -- this is again not correct 
chronologically, before my  husband went for 
the second time to Vietnam, we belonged 
to Fort Belvoir, which is a 
military group here, and there 
was a Jewish chapel and a 
chaplain. We did get a call fr
om our old friend, Rabbi Elst
er, who said that he was 
coming to take over the pulpit at Agudas Ac
him in Alexandria. And of course, when  we 
heard that, we joined 
Agudas Achim and we are still memb
ers today. But Rabbi Elster™s 
not there any more. But at that time we re
freshed -- I mean, we -- we -- we were such 
good friends to begin with, it was wonderful 
to be again with them
, with the Elsters, 
and he became our rabbi. 
And we belonged to 
Agudas Achim and we still belong to 
Fort Belvoir. 
Q: Before we get to the 1983 meeting,
 let me  ask you a question and a half. 
A: Yeah? 
Q: Your son was in high school -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- around in the 70™s when your husband 
left the military and you were living -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
85
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in this area, and stabilized. 
A: Yes 
Q: [indecipherable] stable, 
more stable. You were look
ing around [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, yes. The first time in the same
 place for more than
 a year or two. 
Q: And you had this long fri
endship with this rabbi -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- who later becomes, I know, instru
mental in your own decision to -- 
A: Yes, that™s right. 
Q: -- become active. But I want
 to know if -- h-how -- I don™
t even know how to ask it. 
Your hap -- your bein g a survivor, was this 
something that you had ex -- talked to your 
son about up until that time? Did he know, an
d how did you tell him,
 and was that -- or 
was it an issue? Di -- was it difficult to
 tell him, was it a -- a sensitive -- 
A: No. It was an issue for 
the simple reason that I was very ill from the time he was 
very little. And I had many physi
cal problems and I -- but a -- 
Q: Relating to your experience -- 

A: Probably  everything related, you know, I ha
ve ulcers, I had other very serious progre 
-- problems. And that was one reason that he
 wanted to become a doctor from the time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
86
he was four years of age, cause mo mmy wa
s a lways sick. And mommy was sic k  -- and 
I mean, even in spite of her being sick, sh
e always did everythi
ng and nobody really 
knew that mu ch, but I had an 
awful lot of sickness. But -- 
so that was not mu ch of a 
problem. He knew. And I d
on™t know how much he compre
hended wh en he was very 
young, but he always, when  -- when my  hu
sband went to Vietnam the first time, he 
says, I™m g o ing to be the man of the family
, I™ll take care of Mommy. And he did. He -- 
he was a wonderful boy from th
e very beginning. We never had any problems with him. 
He never smoked, he never dr
ank, he never -- he was neve
r on drugs, he was always 
just a straight arrow. And the thing -- it mu
st have been very di
fficult on him. I -- his 
father was a wonderful father and is a wonderfu
l, very ev en temp ered and all. I was the 
explosive one. I was the one who demanded 
-- demanded mo re than perfection, because 
-- in retrospect, I didn™t realize then, but in 
retrospect I think I tried to live my youth 

through my son. 
Q: Which had been ro bbed from you. 
A: Yes. But he had to be more perfect than 
perfect. He had to havestraight A™s, and he 
had to take all advanced  co
urses, and he had to be th
e big man on campus. And he 
didn™t live up to  one -- he wa -- he never had 
straight A™s even in high school, but yet, 

he was the one -- the only one who was accepted
 at sprin -- to Princeton. He -- he was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
87
wonderful student, but he was so busy with ot
her things too, that he just didn™t get 
straight A™s. I think he had two B™s or so
. But the valedictorian from the high school 
didn™t get into Princeton, but 
Stephen did. Has a wonderful 
personality and he -- he did 
everything beautifully. He -- he would ma
ke a wonderful lawyer, he would make a 
wonderful politician. He is just good with pe
ople, because he was always with people 
and he always had to face new friends beca
use we moved so much. And it did -- it did 
come and I mean it di -- it was good for him.
 And he is very cosmopolitan, he™s very 
sophisticated, and he feels good and felt go
od about himself. I instilled on him that 
there is nothing he cannot do. I told  him, 
you are better than an ybody else, and I was a 
little bit too demanding. So he knew all the 
things; as time progressed I would tell him 
stories, and he was very -- hi-his -- the wa y he received it was very adult like, very 
adult like. And he was, I guess, used to bei
ng sort of the head of
 the family when my 
husband wasn™t there. So he said, don™t wo
rry, Mommy, I™ll take care of you, I™ll take 
care of you. And he did. He was very go
od and he was -- we had an awful -- even 
though when I -- 
the second time wh
en  my  husband was in Vietnam, I already lived 
here in Springfield in our little house. And th
ere were a lot of nasty things that were 
going on. I would get phone calls in the mi
ddle of the night, your husband is in 
Vietnam, we know you™re al
one, you know. And I would ca
ll the police and they would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
88
say I have to -- they cannot do anything unle
ss they are there. We in
stalled a -- what do 
you call it, a -- 
Q: Security -- 
A: -- a secu rity thing and they tried to breakin twice. And Stephen was always just with 

a -- you know, a -- a bat in his 
hand, you know, he 
was going to  take care of. So he was 
very mature for his age and nothing su rpri
sed him any mo re. And 
he™s also -- he™s a 
little bit like his father, he™s a wonderful so
n and I think he™s a 
wonderful husband and a 
wonderful father. Of course, I™m being prejudic
ed at this point, but he really is a very 
good person. He -- he is a -- a urologic surg
eon and he lives now in
 providen t -- outside 
Providen ce, Rhode, Island, and it™s a very po
or state and there are many people that he 
treats pro bono, because they don™t have in
surance, what is he gonna do? And -- but 
anyway, he --

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
89
A: Actually, what I didn™t say before, I said 
I didn™t have any contact with survivors. I 
did keep in touch with one surv ivor who -- 
whom I met in a DP ca
 -- in the Benzheim 
DP camp, and I still keep in touch with her, 
off and on. She surviv
ed with her mother, 
and we kept in touch off a
nd on. Now, I did see her last
 year, and I don™t know if I 
should ev en say it, but all of a sudden I look
 at her -- her mo ther died since and she has 
remar -- she married and sh e just lost he
r husband, she has three children. She was a 
wonderful girl and we were very like, you 
know, real friends. And now when I came -- 
they live in flor -- she lives in Florida, 
I found I have noth ing in common with her 
except the fact that we were
 in the DP camp together, 
in the same DP camp. And I 
don™t know if this is a strange occu rrence 
but all of a sudden -- interestingly enough, 
when  we were in DP camps we didn™t discuss 
our pasts. Most of us
 did not discuss our 
past. I didn™t even know -- I knew that she su
rvived, I think, in Ru
ssia, i-in the Soviet 
Union, she was not in, you kn
ow, in -- in Hitler™s -- under 
Hitler™s regime. But when  I 
met her last year, we had no
thing in common. How can th
at happen? And, I mean, it 
was nice to see her and all, but nothing in  common. But -- do we go back  to wh at, to 
™83?

Q: Well, we were talking ab -- you were sa

and how mu ch he knew  and how -- what -- 
you know, wh at -- how you transferred all 
of that -- 
A: To him. Well -- 

Q: -- history, and -- and was it important 
-- obviously  it was important to you to  -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- that he knew. I mean, that™s not always the case, I th -- 
A: Yes, and he was interested. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: He was very interested, and he -- he a-ag
ain, he is a very sweet boy and -- and was a 
sweet boy and he gave me hi
s love and his caring and wa
s very demonst -- it -- it was 
demonstrated in a very obvious way, and th at
 was very nice. And he -- he d -- I think -- 
I don™t know if he understood ev erything, but it was given to him -- I -- I gave it to him 

gradually. And it wasn™t shocking to him, a
nd he -- because he -- he says, well, that™s 
why you™ve been so ill. And it made a lot of 
sense to him. And th
en in 90 -- 1992, I 
think, I can™t remember and I shouldn™t jump
 ahead, but just to make a point, we had 
one of our annual gatherings
, the child survivors. We c
onsid er ourselves a separate 
group, not all survivors, but th
e child survivors. And we, for 
the first time we organized 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
91
a -- we had a second generation 
panel, and my son came. At
 that time he was already 
married. And he was the leader of the second
 generation. And everyone in th at second 
generation, and th-that™s another story, trie
d to blame the parents for their short -- for 
their shortcomings or for their not realizi
ng their dreams or so, because their parents 
were survivors. And Stephen said that he 
and I got along and he 
accepted me the way I 
was because I am his mother. But he didn™t
 blame the Holocaust 
for my what do you 
call it? Peculiarities or for my
 idiosyncrasies. I was his mo
ther, and as his mother he 
loved me the way I am. And that was his ma in
 argument, that it didn™t have anything to 
do with being a surv ivor. He accepted me 
the way I was. He didn™t blame it on the 
Holo caust or on my  being a 
survivor, why I had temp er tantrums, why I yelled at him, 
why I wanted him to be better than perfect. He
 felt that™s the way I am and that™s what I 
wanted from him. And I don™t know, but 
maybe it was good. Was a very healthy, it 
seems to me, attitude. And now he™s very inte
rested. He doesn™t have much time to be 
involved  with second generation, but like tw
o months from now or I think th is early 
spring, I™m being invited by my  grandsons 
class to speak about my experiences, and 

he™ll introduce me. And that is a day that 
I can™t wait for. And my  grandson does not 
know mu ch. He does, but he is now 11 an d wh en Stephen was 11 he knew a lot mo re. 
My grandson knows when  I come, or when  
I went t -- he was younger, and even now 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
92
he says, Nana, would you sing me these songs 
that are not in English? Lullabies or so. 
And you know -- and he knows a little bit, the ol
der one, but not as much as my son did. 
Q: Hm. That™s interesting. It™s all -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- it™s always interesting to me how pe
ople choose to tell the next generation. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: When they do it,
 how they do it. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s always different with every pers
on. But it sounds like for you, you never 
questioned that you should. 

A: No, no. 

Q: All along. It was never choice, you just -- 

A: Never questioned, only had one [indecipherab
le] all basket -- all eggs in one basket, 
and he need ed to know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He -- and when he was very young, he 
says how come everybo
dy has two sets of 
grandparents and I only have one? You know. 
And that™s the way it started, you know, 
but I tried to make it not so that he wo
uld have nightmares, 
you know, and make it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
93
mo re palatable, I don™t know. And it was a wa
y of life, that™s the way -- just like his 
father was a military man, and there were
 no questions, that™s they way it was. 
Q: And -- and one more questi
on before we get to 1983 and 
take a little break. It seems 
like from what you™re saying 
that from the time you came to 
the U.S. in the late 40™s, 
until this period after your husband came back
 from Vietnam, you had so many travels, 
so many different experiences, 
so much -- you know, in rais
ing a son. Bu t it sounds like 
between the lines that yo -- in a 
way, that you have healed .  
A: Well -- 
Q: Part of you has -- is found a place, found a life -- 
A: -- come -- yes, yes. 
Q: -- and made a happy and safe place for yourself. 

A: Well, and I™ll tell you, I have never been
 nosh -- they 
o -- this -- in schools I get 
many questions -- I me an, many schools ar
e -- are -- are you being seen by a 
psychiatrist, did you have wh at do you 
call it? When  you go th rough years of -- 
Q: Therapy. 

A: -- therapy. I™ve never seen a psychiatrist
, I™ve never gone thro
ugh therapy. I think 
my healing came from my fam
ily, from my  husband and my  son. And my  aunt. No 
matter  what, may she r est in peace , she was a n
 angel. I really miss her so much. She -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
94
she and I understood each other finally, and I -- I don™t know if I appreciated her as 
mu ch wh en I first came to this country  as sh
e deserved to be appreciated, but I loved 
her with all my heart, and 
sh e deserved that love.  
Q: Isn™t it amazing how one person can make a difference in a life? 

A: Oh yes, yes. Mm-hm. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: When I came here, I mean, 
my  mother was a teacher by 
profession, but she wasn™t 
teaching. I don™t remember her ever teachi
ng. She did an awful lot of philanthropic 
things in our town and as a matter of fa
ct, she organized camp s for poor ch ildren, 
Jewish children and Gentile chil -- children.
 And I mean not she alone, but she was 
always the head of it. And 
so she wasn™t, you know, sitti
ng at home and all, but we 
always had a lot of quality time,
 and I didn™t learn how to 
cook and all, w
ho would ever 
think? But my mother set a be
autiful table, and we always 
had a lot of people, was an 
open house, people were coming and going. 
And she -- and I always -- I remember like 
for Passover or so, I mean, there was crys
tal and there was silver, and the linen 
tablecloths and ch ina. And I™ve 
always missed that, and I reme
mber even in the forest, I 
would so rt of daydream, gos
h, when I grow up, Momma 
will come and show me how 
to set a pretty table. And then
 when I came to the States, to
 the United States, my aunt, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
95
don™t know what it was, but she set a beautif ul table, even though that her heart was 
crying within her, but the ho
lidays, Thanksgiving and Pass
over, the little time th at we 
spent that I was there, she set a beautiful tabl
e with linens and crysta
l and I told her, that 
reminds me of home. 

Q: Mm. 

A: And to me even now -- we
 live in an apartment and usually it™s all right, now it™s a 
mess, but I don™t entertain any more, no
body does. Bu t nothing gives me greater 
pleasure than to set a pretty table. And it so
mehow brings me closer to my  past. And my  
daughter-in-law, I mean, they entertain quite a bit, and she does -- she sets a table 
magnificently. And that endears her to me 
greatly. And it means a 
lot. I don™t know, 
maybe because it brings memo ries of my  pa
st. But I have come -- I don™t know, I™ve 
not made peace, because I still have nightmar
es and awful things, but I think I™ve -- I 
have probab ly healed, 
cause I couldn™t have surviv ed if
 tha -- if I hadn™t. And I -- I -- 
my attitude, I have a good attitude, because 
I™ve been very lucky, I have a good man. 
And I just hope he™ll be here forever for me
, selfishly. And I have a good son, we have 
two wonderful gray -- grandchildren. An
d only health permitti
ng, you know. My 
husband is on a three months schedule and ev
ery three months when he goes back, my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
96
heart skips a beat. But life goes on and you 
have to smile and put
 on a happy face and 
be happy, even if it™s pretending. 
Q: Let™s take a break now and get something 
to eat. [tap e break]. Here we are, we™re 
back from a break. We were goi
ng to talk now about your 
decision in the early 80™s to 
speak out. You mentioned befo re we took
 a break that there was a survivor™s 
conference or a gathering of so
me sort that you went to? 
A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: Why don™t you te
ll me about that? 
A: Well, yeah it was -- I think it was in 1983,
 and at that time my  husband was out of 
the military , he had a new career, our son 
was in school, and -- already in co llege, I 
guess. And I was settled. In other words, we di
dn™t have to move again like in a year or 
so. And all of a su -- not all of a sudden, 
but I was thinking it was time to try and reach 
out and get in touch with some -- to get 
a relationship with  some other survivors, 
because I did not have it, traveling around,
 you know, all over th
e world, you know, 
being in the military. 
Q: And did you feel the need for it, or -- 
A: Yes. I felt -- no, I felt the need for -- I -- I 
didn™t feel the need for it, but I felt it was 
time. It was time becau se I ha
d no relationship with anyone 
-- with survivors, per se, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
97
and the only one was my  girlfriend from Be
nzheim DP, with wh om I corresponded, and 
she came, as a matter o f fact, to visit us on
ce with her family, in 
Springfield, when we 
still lived in Springfield. She did get married
, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP 
camp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle 
-- an older -- mostly it used to be, you 
know, older men. She married a very nice, very
 fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af 
-- the brother had also a fami ly and they a
ll -- they all emigrated 
to America to gether. 
And my friend™s -- Rya is her name -- Rya™s mother was still alive. And all of them 
ended up in the United States, 
I think about a year before I 
did. How they were able to 
do th at, I don™t know, but sh-she was the only on
e I kept in touch with. And at that time 
it wasn™t that I felt the need 
for it, I just felt it was time to
 get in touch in with  other 
survivors. Maybe it was a need, I don™t know, but I felt it was time 
because I was in one 
place and I wasn™t going to go
 overseas again. And so when
 the time came, as it was, 
there was going to be, I think 
th e first gathering of survivor
s in Washington, D.C., and I 
think it was 1983, and I attended it. It was 
not quite a week, but it was more than one 

day, I don™t recall exactly. And there I me
t many new people, and 
some whom I have 
known from the DP camps, and it was nice to be
 together. It was a rather emotional and 
solemn gathering. And most of the people th at I knew have settled an
d have also started  
their own lives and were successful in be
coming Americanized. Af
ter that meeting, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
98
which was several days, it lasted several days
, I remember one thing very distinctly, I 
met -- forgot his first name, Rosenzaft is hi
s name, he is the -- th
e was at that time, I 
think, the first second generation activist. 
And he made a very emotional and very 
memorable speech at that meeting, and he 
was telling us -- he was -- he was born in 
Bergen-B elsen, where his parents ended up at
 the end of the war. An
d when they said, I 
was born in Bergen-B elsen, people said, oh in
 a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at 
that time it was a DP camp. But he was bor
n in that camp, and he became very active 

and he still is. I forgot his first name, but yo
u know, that I rememb er
 from that meeting. 
And after that meeting, things were quiet, but
 it™s sort of like -- it gave me a little seed 
in my mind. I knew I had to do something, I 
didn™t know what, and I didn™t know what 

I was ready to do. At that point we did be
lo ng to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly 
Elster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went 
to him and I said, I wa
nt to do something 
to honor the memory of all th
e ones, the millions who peri
shed in the Holocaust. And 
he looked  at me and right away  he says
, why don™t you become a Bat Mitzvah? You 
know what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here. 
I said, oh, but I don™t know. And Hebrew, I 
don™t know any prayers. I mean, you know, I-I 
was really  an ignora
mus when it came 
to, you know, Hebrew reading, and chan ting 
and all that. He says, I™ll teach you. That 
was, I think, in January. In April that day -- that year, 1985, was Yom HaShoah, the you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
99
know, observance. And they star
ted observing -- at that time
 they did already observe it 
at the rotunda, you know, in  the Capitol. But our synago
gue usually had sort of a 
religious school, you know, commemo ration or 
something, not as elaborate and all, but 
just to commemo rate. And I said well, I don™
t know, but if I -- I don™t think I could 
learn by April, you know, all the chanting and 
all the Haftorah and ev erything. Cause I 
didn™t know any of the blessings in Hebr
ew , nothing. Didn™t even
 know how to read. 
And he says, I™ll teach you, an
d he proceeded to teach me. An
d by April, to make it -- it 
was very difficult and it took an  awful lot of 
time, and my  husband said he could recite 
some of the prayers in his sleep because 
he heard me repeating them so many times. 
And came f -- when -- when April came, I don™
t rememb er what day, I think it was also 
the 25
th
 or something, 21
st
 or 25
th
, I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah. 
And I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a 

very nice accomplishment. I i
nvited the entire congreg ation and actually some of my 
relatives from Columbus, Ohio
 and New York, and so me of them came. And they said 
later, they said, yeah we came because we fe
lt sorry for you and we didn™t want you to 
fall on your face without family around. We
ll, I didn™t fall on my face. I astounded 
them all be cause I did the whole thing.
 Usually kids, you know, learn from very 
beginning and th en it takes them a year or so
. And I chanted it all and did a good job, if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
100
I must say so myself. And after that we di
d attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe 
not every Saturday or -- but ar
ound that time when I was pr
eparing for my Bat Mitzvah, 
I did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and 
I made -- and my remarks were centered 
around the theme that this is Yom HaShoah a
nd I™d like -- this is 
my way of honoring 
all the millions who perished during th e Ho
locaust. And it was -- I felt very good ab out 
it. Well, at this time my wond
erful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class 
-- I mean for their graduation, they have He
brew school and then , you know, religious 
school and then the people -- 
the students who want to go on
 after their bat mit -- Bar 
and Bat Mitzvah wh en -- they 
call them to confirmation class. And he says, you mu st 
go and sp eak to my  kids in confirmation clas
s. And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I 
cannot do that. I -- my  English isn™t good. I 
-- I -- I don™t have my  story, you know, in -- 
in my head. He says, I don™t care. And that 
was a Sunday morning wh
en he has a cla ss. 
He dragged me in and he says, I™ll give you
 questions and you answer. And th at was my  
first presen tation, against my will. I was pe
trified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public 
speaker, not that I am now, bu
t I -- I -- it was very difficult 
and it was really, I mean, he 
pushed me and I was angry with  him that he
 did. But it was a wonderful beginning. Not 
a wonderful, but a beginning of
 something that I realized I had to do. And what I 
realized at that time -- I mean
 then, the next Su nday  he ha
d another class, and he says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
101
well you keep on, you™ve d
one great and you™ll do even  
better. You mu st -- and you 
know, the first time w h en I made this presen
tation, when I finished, I got sick to my 
stomach, you know, went and th rew up. But 
little by little, it was easier as time went 
on, and then I realized that this
 is what I have to do. I have
 to bear witness, I have to 
share my experiences, especi
ally with young people. And Rabbi Elster gave me  the 
push in the right direction, 
and because of him I started doing this. And it grew  from 
that one, first confirma tion class. 
Q: In that first class, di
d -- do you have a memo ry of
 the -- how th e young people 
responded, and -- 
A: They were -- they were stunned, because 
at that time there weren™t many people that 
went into  details and all. And I have one 
instance, the -- and this is something that 
people remember because it is 
so, I think, unusual. I have 
an instance where there were 
seven of us ended up in a haystack , in a 
huge haystack. And I think that -- and my  
whole presentation, centered around th at fact. 
And -- and I mean there were seven of us, 
and onl -- and I™m the only one who su rviv ed. 
And after the presentation, the -- all these 
kids, or most of them, came around to give
 me a hug an d to ask questions. And it felt 

good. It wasn™t a catharsis, but it felt as if th
is is what I have to do now. My travels 
were over with, I wasn™t the military wife 
any more, and I had to do something else, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
102
and -- and that was the thing I had to do. A
nd this is the way it evolved and th e strange 
or interesting th ing is, as the years go by, it 
seems that a -- of course now I™m with the 
Speakers™ Bureau of the Ho
locaust Museum, and a lot of
 my gigs -- my si -- my 
presentations come through the mu seum, but I 
also have an awful lot of them that are 
by word  of mouth, that people heard me, or
 they -- somebody said something, and they 
call me. And I go back there maybe once a year 
for five or six or seven years, and lately 
now, from the museum, I™ve been sent all 
throughout the countr
y to sp eak. And like 
two years ago I was the guest speaker at th
e -- in Utah at Salt Lake City at the 
governor™s mansion, wh at do 
you call it, at th e governor™s
 invitation and I made the 
keynote speech for Yom HaShoah. I™ve been 
to a number of places
, and military places, 
and I have now -- I have s -- a schedule all 
the way until, I think June, with many, you 
know, si -- some -- I th ink I™m going to Io
wa and I™m going to -- just came back from 
South Dakota and Kent
ucky. And the reception -- as th
e years go by -- the reception™s 
always been  very  cordial, but it seems that 
the students now, especially in high schools 
and middle schools, the students are mu ch mo re knowledgeable because the teachers 
offer so much more 
information. And that happens in turn  because th e mu seum and 
other places, I™m sure, too, 
offer so many wonderful course
s that inform the teachers 
how to re -- how to teach the Holocaust. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
103
Q: I reme mber -- excuse me -- in your or
al history interview 
you mentioned you had 
been doing this for 10 y
ears already in  1995. 
A: Since 1985, yeah. 
Q: You -- you mentioned an early experien
ce you had at a school wh ere a parent -- 
A: Y-yeah , oh, well -- 

Q: -- questioned -- 
A: -- yeah, I had two instances -- 
Q: -- questioned your story. 

A: -- I had two instances, negative instances 
in all the -- in all my experience --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- you know, time that I™ve been speaki
ng. One was the one you referred to and it 
was at the Children™s Capital Museum, before  the Holocaust Museum was built. And at 

that time, I don™t know if you were here, 
and are you familiar with
 it, they had one 
section, and I th -- I think they called it -- they
 didn™t call it Daniel™s story, but it was, in 
essence, the composite of a young boy who 
lives through the horrors in Germany. And 
it was -- bu -- I mean, Daniel™s story is that 
composite boy. And what -- I don™t know i -
- under whose auspice -- auspices this wa
s, but they would br
ing students, young 
students, and I think some of them were, 
you know, still from elem
entary school. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
104
would bring them to that children™s mu seum
, and they would let them go through the 
rooms and familiarize themselv
es with the story of this 
boy, Daniel. And then  wh en 
they finished listening to the description an
d going through the ro
oms, they -- each one 
would receive a tile, an d they had to regi
ster their impressions with painting a 
statement. And -- you know, th
ey gave them paint and -- and the tiles. And this one 
time there were two kids in that group, fro
m two different classes, but the same school. 
And of co urse they always had chaperones, a
nd this father, this one man, came over to 
me. I happened tha -- usually he -- when  they 
had these presentations of Daniel™s story, 
they tried to get a survivor to finish  off. Af
ter the kids went through the story of Daniel, 
they would have a survivor speak about his 
or her own experiences, and th at sort of 
finished off the program. Well, 
it was my turn, because I partic
ipated in it, to speak that 
day and I got up, wherever it was, and ther
e were all these kids, you know, sitting and 
listening to my  story. And I made it very 
simple, because it -- th
ese were young kids. 
But after I was finished this guy comes over, 
and there were several parents, obviously, 
you know, with the kids a
nd th ey were always very 
nice and asked meaningful 
questions. But this time this guy co mes over a
nd looks at me and first of all he says, 
now wh at™s your na -- hey, yo
u, you know, wh at™s your na
me? Usually I say, Charlene 
Schiff. To him I said Mrs. Schiff, you know.
 Already I sensed so
mething wrong. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
105
he says, you know, Mrs. Schiff, come, come, a
ll this is a figment of your imagination. 
Just like that. I wa -- I -- I 
was spe echless for a minute, c a
use I di -- I -- I mean, I was 
completely taken by, you know
, surprise. And I said, how 
dare you say something like 
this to me? And I said, do you 
th ink anybody would co me up to
 bare one™s soul just to 
make up a story? He said well, there was no 
Holocaust, and things like that. That was 
my  one ex per -- and am -- I -- and I asked -- I 
said, well if you don™t believe that there 
was a Holocaust, why did you br
ing your two children -- not one, but two, two children, 
to this museum, to the Childre
n™s museum. He says, well, they
 -- they needed -- tha-that 
was a -- an outing, or whatever
 he called it, and a field trip
 and they  need
ed a chaperone 
and I wasn™t working that day, 
so I said I™ll g o . Or in other 
words, he didn't even realize 
what they  were going to see or hear. And th
at was one instance. And the other one was 
in a school. And that was in a mid d le school in this area -- 
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
106
Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is Charlene Schiff, tape four, side 
one. Can you start again?
 It happened here, in 
a local school. 
A: Yes, in a -- a middle school, and usually what
 I try to do if it™s possible, I encourage 
the teachers to get several classed together 
so, you know, I can spea
k to more than one 
class. And usually they  honor my request if it™s possible. In this school they  did use the 
auditorium and there were a
bout 500 kids or so, yeah. 
The whole mi ddle school. And 
after my  presentation I always ask to have 
a Q and A and the kids started raising th eir 
hands with questions. And in th e middle of 
this all, or you know, a few minutes after 
the questioning started, this one kid gets up
 and mo st of them we
re wearing very nice 
clothes, school clothes, you kno
w, jeans and all. This kid ha
d a hat, what do you call it, 
a -- with the visor in the back
. I don™t know what you call it,
 but anyway, he looked like 
he was sort of a troublemaker. Tall, good-
looking kid, dark. An
d he says, Miss Schiff, 
how many Jews were mur -- were killed? Ho
w many Jews did you 
say were killed? I 
said, I didn™t say. I don™t ever like to take
 -- to say, you know, numb ers, cause I -- you 
know, I™ll say 6,000, they say no, it was only 
6001, or whatever. I 
don™t give numb er -- 
I said I -- I didn™t say. But how many would 
you say were killed? And I said, well, there 
were six million Jews and five
 million others. And I said, 
even one being killed was too

many. And he sort of took off his head and 
started scratching his -- took off his hat and 
started scratching his head and hair. He sa
id, well six million, maybe it was a few too 
many. Just like that. And I -- he was looking to  see that people will start laughing. It 
was dead silence. I said, as far as I™m c
oncerned, even  one was too many. And are you 
satisfied now that you made yo
ur joke? Just like that. And he says, it™s not a joke. And I 
said yes, it is a joke. And he was standing
 there. And after I said, you know, tha -- you -
- you finished with your joke or wh atev
er, and even  one is too many, the whole 
audience got up and started applauding and I 
got a standing ovation. And at that time he 
walked out. And then I fo
und out he is -- he was from a Muslim f -- you know, 
household and his father was 
a Muslim and he came -- he would come to school always 
with very  contradictory statements and all. 
I wish the teachers had warned me. I don™t 
know what I would had done differently, but
 nobody did until af
ter it happened. And 
those two instances were my  only instances 
where it was unpleasant and traumatic, very 
traumatic. But other than that, I never had 
th at kind of an experience. And as time 
progresses, which is again very, t-to me, of gr
eat interest, the intere
st in the Holocaust, 
and you know, history per se
, you know, about World Wa
r II, the interest by young 
people increases every year. I don™t know wh
at to blame it on, or what to give cr -- 
credit, and especially now, after September 11
th
, it -- it is really amazing, and a -- I just

came back from Kentucky, that™s my most re
cent gig, and I was amazed. I spoke there 
in a high school and a middle school, two di
fferent schools, and the reception couldn™t 
have been mo re cordial. It was -- it happe
ned it was my  birthday, and I n -- I ne -- I 
don™t know how they found out, but I gue
ss from the internet, or whatever, and -- 
Q: Watch your scarf there. 
A: -- both schools had great bi
g signs outside when  I came
 in, happy birthday, Mrs. 
Schiff, happy birthday, Charle
ne. They baked me a cake, 
they sang ﬁHappy Birthdayﬂ, 
all 500 of them. And i-it was in -- and the ques
tions, if I had the time, if I didn™t have to 
catch a plane, I could have stayed there anot
her day, they were so eager to learn more, 
and I had to  promise them they would send
 me the questions and I™ll answer writing. 
It™ll never happen, you know. But it -- it -- and 
this is occurring everywhere. So I -- I -- 

it™s not a catharsis for me, but I feel I™m doing
 the right thing at the right time. This is 
my  time to bear witness as long as I can st
and up on my  own two feet
, and as long as I 
can still speak somewhat coherently and reme
mber what transpired. I think it™s very 
important for -- especially for the young 
people to know, and once we™re gone, it will 
be -- it™s w o nderful that we have the museum
, and it™s wonderful that that legacy is 
there, and the museum stands there as a wa
rning that people sh
ouldn™t tamper w ith 
human rights. But it™s still not the same as w h
en I -- a live person stands there and tells 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
109
you wh at happened to  him or her. And that™s
 why I was -- I™m doing it, and it turns out 
it™s almost -- not quite, but al
most a full time job, yeah. 
Q: Why do you say it™s not
 a catharsis for you? 
A: Because every day when I tell my story,
 I remember -- and now it™s getting hazy, but 
I remember new details, and it™s as if reliving
 everything that happened all over again. 
It™s not a catharsis, no way. Many times I -- 
I -- I went with David Klevin the other day 
to a school and I -- usually they allot me -- 
allow me to sp eak an 
hour, maybe two at the 
most. And there, I think I was there 9:15, di
dn™t get out until one o™clock, because the 
kids had so many questions and they had 
the time from other subjects, they allowed 
them to stay, you know, and que -- question 
me. And when I got home, you know what 
I did? Went to bed. I was emotionally drai
ned and that happens a lot. So it is not a 
catharsis, b u t it feels that -- it feels that I ha
ve to do it. And that™s why I™m doing it. I 
am a -- in our group, like the -- the group of
 child survivors, I pr
each whenever I go. 
Now, I can™t even attend there the monthly 
-- we have monthly meetings, cause I™m so 
busy. And a lot o-of my  presentations are on Sundays, too. I™ve had two or three 

church es. Yesterday was an exception, 
wasn™t a Sunday, but usually it™s Sunday 
evening when I speak to
 the adults, you know, in -- in the church es. And like yesterday, 
you know, I™m so glad it didn™
t snow or rain, but their social hall, th ere was -- p eople 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
110
were standing, there was no room in the seat
s to -- to accommodate everyone. And that 
makes me  feel good, but a catharsis
 it is not. Abso lutely not, no.  
Q: Tell me about your decision to b
ecome involved w
ith the museum. 
A: Well, since I™ve been sp
eaking, you know, since 1985 and all, when  the mu seum 
was built, and I remember that opening day, 
it was an April day, it was raining, it was 
cold and windy. It was just like everyone el
se felt, you know, in their hearts. That™s the 
way the weather was reflecting it. And our son 
came down to  be with us and to witness 
it, too. And then I said, well gosh, I mean, th
e museum is here, let 
me see what I can do 
there. I don™t think it was right when they
 opened, but a little la
ter. A nd then came -- 
John Minnick joined, and he 
is the director of the Spea
kers™ Bureau. And I filled out 
some papers, and somebody said well, why 
don™t you go and become
 a -- work in the 
archives or start translating, you know, th
at™s a very interesting thing, you know, I 
could translate in several languages. And th en
, I don™t know if I™m proficient any mo re, 
but at that time I thought, well, I™d rather 
be with people. I want to do so mething where 
I™m not going to  be by my self. And that s
eemed -- you know, I was doing that anyway, 
I said well, maybe I should go an-and join  
the Speakers™ Bureau. 
And the way it™s -- it 
fell into place, I don™t know if it was organize
d, I shouldn™t -- it™s not fo r me to criticize, 

but right now there are about 20 of us. Th
ere are 64 surv ivors who wo rk, who volunteer 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
111
at the museum, 20 or so are 
with the Speakers™ Bureau, a
nd maybe I™d better not say it. 
You know what I™m -- was going to say. 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: But just -- I think a few of
 us work more than others, 
for good reasons. And the thing 
is when I go to my meeti
ngs, the children™s -- the -- the 
child survivors meetings, I 
always have arguments with the rest of my  
friends and they all have become friends -- 
maybe not all, but some have become very
 close friends, and I 
say, why don™t you go 
out to sp eak? We need a good mouthpiece. A
nd very few are intere
sted in doing that. 
Q: Well, this is what I want
ed to  ask you ab out next.  
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: What -- how do you un
derstand that, that -- 
A: I don™t. Well, I do and I don™t. I mean, I 
started out, and I™m not a speaker, but I feel 
now that I -- I write out my remarks, mostly
, because of being so sick wh en -- early on 
in my  life. Sometimes I start speaking and 
I™m at a loss for a word . I cannot rememb er 
it. But when I have it written out, I™m much 
more comfortable. And I have several -- I 
have about -- every time I change a little bit a
nd I have about 20 di
fferent formats. One 
is 20 pages, one is 40 pages, you know, th
ings like that. Large letters, you know, so I 
can read. But some people don™t know ho
w to speak. I didn™t either, but I felt a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
112
compulsion, that I -- a duty that I had to do
 it and so I learned. So me of these people 
have selfish motives. They don™t want to 
be remind -- reminded of their experiences, 
and they  don™t want to have
 anything to  do with it. I reme mb er one meeting we 
attended -- every year we have
 international meetings, that
 people from all over Israel 
and from Europe come to these meetings. An
d every month we have our own meetings. 
Once we had an international meeting, an
d I met two brothers from Connecticut, two 
brothers who su rviv ed the Holo caust. One br
other talks about it a
ll the time -- not all 
the time, b u t I mean, he is facing reality a
nd his past. The other guy is -- he -- it™s the 
first time h e introduced him cause that was the 
first time he ever came to a meeting, that 
was an international meeting. An d he has 
never spoken about his experiences. He™s 
married to an American wo
man who doesn™t know his pa
st. I mean, I don™t see how 
you can live with a person and not tell her your
 story. Bu t anyway , he doesn™t want to 
face it. You know, he doesn™t 
want to go through again what
 he what -- what he lived 
through once. So, I don™t know, 
I don™t know how to explain it. 
Q: Hm. How -- how is your -- how -- the [indeci
pherable] this group of child survivors, 
how is that group, other than the age differenc
e, how is their view of the Holo caust and 
their -- as a group, their work in -- in talk
ing about the Holocaust,
 how do you think it™s 
different from other survivor groups? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
113
A: Well, it™s very different, to this day. 
And that™s another ongoi
ng, friendly discussion 
that we have. Our group -- first of all, mo
st of the memb ers in our group are qui -- 
Q: What is the name of your group, by the way? 
A: Child Su rvivors of the Holo caust. 

Q: And is it a local kind of [indecipherable] 

A: Well, it™s not just the lo -- it™s -- it-it™s a 
-- we have, I think, ab
out 30 or 45 different 
groups in the United States, in 
England, in -- all over the plac
e. And it™s stupid, then no 
-- again I™m using the word I shouldn™t, but it 
is, in a way childish to refer to ourselves, 
child survivor -- survivors. Mo
st of the people who su rviv
ed were children. Very few 
adults did su rvive. But now none of us is a ch
ild, but we still refer 
to ourselves as child 
survivors. The difference in these groups 
-- I don™t know if you™re familiar with Nessie 
Godin in  th-the mu seum? Who 
doesn™t know Nessie? Her group -- I say her, she is the 
co-chairman of the group, is survivors an
d friends. Their policy was from the beginning 
to open their -- I m
ean, they accept anyone who is in
terested in the cause of the 
Holocaust, or in -- in the them
e, Holocaust, is welcome. Our 
group, to this day, is -- I 
would call it almost like a hypochondriac cause
, or case. They feel, most of them do, 
God forb id anybody should join  who is no
t a Holocaust survivo
r. They™ll steal o u r 
secrets? What will they do to 
us? But they feel that they 
don™t want anyone but just the

child survivors. When I first 
joined, it was a very strange s
ituation. I came in with Ed, 
and they -- you know, I said, my name is 
Charlene Schiff, I™m a child survi -- who is 
that? I said, my husband. Is he a survivor? 
No . Ou t you go. They  wouldn™t allow him to 
stay, so I got up and I was going to  go. And 
I mean, eventually, after some debate and 
all, they ma gnanimously  allowed my  husband
 to come to the m eetings. Now, this 
situation has sort of evolved. No w spouses, 
if they are not surviv
ors, are allowed to 
come. But it™s sort of a real closed group.
 They don™t want to
 have any kind of 
relationship with anybody else. And basically, until very recently, this group was a 

support group, let™s face it. 
Q: Mm. Mm-hm. 
A: And there™s some people who, 50 plus 
years later, still n
eed that support. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: There are many people who burst out in tear
s when they talk abou
t their family that 
maybe one memb er perished and the rest of th
em are alive. Their -- I mean, I -- I ha -- 
don™t have any tears any mo re since -- sin
ce I came to this country . I -- I don™t know 
how to cry any mo re. I don™t. But when  I sp
eak, I divorce myself from my old self, 
cause otherw ise I couldn™t do it. But these pe
ople are not strong en
ough, a lot of them, 
and they still need a lot of emotional support 
and they don™t want an
yone else to know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
115
about their struggle and about their emotiona
l weaknesses. So that™s the way I would 
explain it. 
Q: What do you mean though,
 Charlene, when you say you
 don™t have any tears any 
mo re, you don™t cry any mo re? You™re very  emotional -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- when you talk about -- at least on this tape -- 
A: I am, but I -- I -- I d on™t -- I can™t cry eas
ily and the thing wh-w hen -- when  -- I cried 
when  my  friend™s husband died. We said go
od-bye to him a mon -- a month -- an hour 

before he died, we were in hi
s room. For that I cried. But 
when I think that my sister, 
who went to her death with her beloved -- I can™t cry.  

Q: You mean you won™t let yourself. Becaus
e you said when  you came -- when you 
first came to Co lumbus, you cried every night -- 

A: Yes. Yeah. 
Q: -- by yourself and -- but 
I -- I™m just trying to -- 
A: I was even considering -- 
Q: -- what you say -- 
A: -- I was considerin g going back to the DP camp s. 
Q: Really? You were so lonely? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
116
A: I -- it wasn™t loneliness, it was just 
confusion and ch ao s and not knowing wh at™s 
ahead. I shouldn™t have 
said that. But -- 
Q: Does -- does this ability that you have or  have learned, to speak in public, do you 
think it™s part of what gives you strength? 

A: I think so . I hate it when 
people tell me, oh you™re tough, you can do anything. I am 
not tough. It™s just that life has dealt me a 
very difficult hand, and I learned how to cope 
with it, and how to deal with
 it, partly because of my  wonderful help  from my  husband 
and my  son. But I am not tough, and it™s -- 
and I™m not hard, but that™s the way people 
judge me. I don™t like it at all, but I™ve heard 
it a lot, and I™m sure th ey mean it as a 
compliment.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But it™s not. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I -- I don™t know how to  explain it, 
but I -- even, you know, after I got married 
and things where -- were, you know, great, 
an-and there was -- you know, there were 
[indecipherable] and there was -- there were 
times when it was very difficult and all, 
but this is something that ha
ppens in everyone™s life. And in  a way I do understand my  
son™s philosophy and his 
approach to things, 
and he™s -- he accepts 
me as I am, and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
117
doesn ™t blame it on the Holocaust. That™s -- 
maybe I would have been this way without 
the Holo caust, who knows? Pu shy and very  
aggressive and very demanding wh ere -- 
where my  son, you know, wa
s involved. And now I reali
ze that it was very probably 
wrong, but in spite of it all,
 it turned out okay. So -- 
Q: You mentioned September 11
th
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And talking in -- to groups of people afte
r that. There have been so many times in 
the past 20 years when there ha
ve been wo rld events that 
I would think could be very 
upsetting to you. Things like the war in th e former Yugoslavia and the massacres in 

Rwanda, and the fighting 
in Chechnya,
 you know. 
A: Yes. Well -- 
Q: Every time a minority of people is su-subjugated -- 

A: Was fighting for independence and for fre
edom. Everywhere there is a fight for 
freedom, it churns within me. But 
the reason I brought up September 11
th
, September 
11
th
 is unique in my mind for one reason only. It
 was the first time that here in America 
we were touched on our soil. And I think September 11
th
 is very unfortunately 
important because we American
s were touched where it hurts
 us most. It seems that 
until September 11
th
, all the other horrible, horrible 
situations in Rwanda, where the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
118
United Nations promised help, an
d I went to hear General -- 
I™m terrible with names -- 
Diddio. The general who was in charge of 
the Rwanda, you know, 
contingent, and he 
was promised by the United Nations to get a
ll the help he needed, and wh en he got to 
Rwanda, all he saw is death and destruc
tion and massacre and not any help from the 
United Nations. And cons
equently he resigned his post
 and became a drunk for awhile. 
I mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks abou
t this situation. That churns within me 
and it makes me sick, physically ill. All this, 
Bosnia and all that. But to the American 
psyche, I think one of the mo st important th
ing, do anything, but don™t come to my 
beloved America, to my soil, on my soil. Do
n™t do anything on my soil. And sin the -- 
since the Civil War and all, 
all the wars were fought outs
ide of the United States. And 
September 11
th
, sadly, touched us right
 here. And that™s why it™s so important to the 
Americans. That™s the way I figure. I also 
have seen something here that I was mi ssing 
all these years. We went to Israel, can™t re
me mb er wh en , in
 the 80™s, and the first thing 
that struck me was the fantastic pride a
nd patriotism that the 
people have. Maybe 
they™re not as observant, you know, religiously, 
but when  they wo re 
that uni -- wore th-
the uniform of the military, th
ey did it with pride, wearin
g it and holding their heads up 
high. Here in America, when there is a war, 
G od forbid, the militaryis regarded as one 
of us. When there is no war, th
e military are second rate citizen
s. The military is sort of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
119
an underclass, and it™s been that way ever si
nce I came here and I -- and I was a military 
and still am a miri -- military wife and I™m
 very proud of it.
 Since September 11
th
, you 
see stickers, I™m proud to be an American
. You see the flag on cars and I think it did 
awake our patriotism and our pride in bei
ng an American. And it didn't do that when  
Chechnya started, when  Bo snia started, wh
en Uganda started, when -- when all these 
other terrible, you know, wars started su -- 
on a different soil, not on American soil. 
And this is why I think it™s different. I might 
be -- I™m probably very  wrong, but this is 
my explanation. And that™s wh
y, until now, am -- most places,
 I always when I start my 
remarks, since September 11
th
, I start with the horrible tragedy of September 11
th
, and I 
comp are it. And I -- I do say it has no comp aris
on to the Holo caust, but
 it is also driven 
by ev il, by -- by people who ha
te, blind hate, and by people
 who have no regard s for 
human life. And this is one thing that we 
must fight for. And I -- I have my four evil 
eyes, and I say even now, 55 
years after the Holocaust, we 
must all fight the four evil 
eyes. The evil of indifference, the evil of inju
stice, the evil of into
lerance and th e evil of 
ignorance, four eyes. And th
e kids always write it down. 
Q: I™m going to jump
 around a little bit. 
A: Okay . 
Q: You mentioned that you traveled to Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
120
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: What was that like 
for you to be there? 
A: That was very, very emotional. The reason
 it was emotional, first of all, we™ve made 
friends while here, with -- usually we try to
 find out who is here from Israel, an d we 
became very good friends with the military 
attachés and the ambassadors and all, and 
they would stay here three y
ears and then go back
 to Israel. So we™ve had several and 
the last one, poor guy, he 
now has Parkinson™s. But Hada
ssah and Jakov Gran at and he 
was the military attaché here in Washington.
 Can™t remember the years, it™s terrible. 
But anyway, when we were visiting Israel, we
 got in touch with the Granats and we had 
a wonderful time visiting th em. And th en I did get in touch with some people with 

whom I was -- I wasn™t in the same DP cam
p, but they were in  a neighboring, there 
were so ma ny of them. And there was one gu
y there who was my father™s student. And 

he ended up he didn't make it 
to Palestine, he ended up be
ing caught and he ended up in 
the Polish army when the war started, and so
 he had a story of his own. Bu t when he 
came out after the war, he s -- found out that 
I was alive and he came to say hello. And 
through me he met this other girl, who was in
 a different DP camp and they fell in love 
and they  got married. So
 we visited with them. 
Q: Let me turn the tape 
over now. Hold that thought.

End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is Charlene Schi
ff, tape four, side two. 
A: My God. 
Q: You visited with them. 

A: Yes, I visited with them, and he gather
ed togeth er other students and people who 
knew my parents. Mostly my father™s fo
rmer students, and they had -- I think I 
mentioned it before, they had a -- an evening wh
ere they paid tribute 
to my father -- my 
parents, but mostly my father, and reminisced
 and -- and told me s-stories that I didn™t 
know about my  dad. And it was very, very em
otional, but also very nice, because they 
actually knew my  parents and it™s something 
very, very dear to 
me. So, and then we 
went sightseeing and we -- we didn™t stay th
ere long enough. We never did go to the 
southern part, to Eilat, but we
 had a private guide because I 
couldn™t walk very  well, so 
we ha-had a car and a private gu
ide. And this guide turned ou t to be a retired military in 
the mili -- in -- in the -- in 
the Israeli military. And so he 
and my husband hit it off very 
well. It was a very nice visit in Israel. I ca
me home mu ch stronger after that visit, it was 
good for me. It was beautiful 
to see Israel, but you know, it™
s amazin g, not specifically 
in Israel, in  Israel and in the United States, wh
en I get off a plane, to
 this day, I feel like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
122
getting on my  knees and kissing th e ground. 
Because the United States, no ma tter how 
we criticize it and all, it™s still the best -- be
st country in the worl
d to live in, with our 
demo cracy and our freedoms and we should 
cherish them. And so many times, mo st of 
us take it all for granted. 
And Israel is to me a 20
th
 century miracle.
 When you drive 
through you see the desert and then all of 
a sudden there -- there are trees and there is 
water, and there are beautiful flowers, and 
there are fish, you know, and it -- it -- it™s 
just a miracle, a mirage. And that again, I 
mean, is worth of gettin
g down on your knees 
and kissing the ground. And that™s th
e way I feel about the two countries. 
Q: Mm-hm. This current round of violence in 
the middle -- in -- in -- 
in that part of the 
world must be hard. It must be hard. 
A: It™s very difficult. And you 
know, all this violence, all ove
r now, Chechnya is -- is an 
unresolved situation, and I mean
 Bosn ia -- I don™t think -- it™s 
sort of, I think, quiet right 
now and all. But there is so much hate, fo
r hundred s of years, and I don™t think it™s 
really resolved a hundred perc
ent, never will be. And all th
e other places of unrest, and 
especially, especially Israel, 
it is something that is very, 
very sad. And I know I feel 
very frustrated. I™m not a politician, I™m not 
a political science majo
r. I don™t know how 
you resolve something like that, and especi
ally now with Iraq, you know, and -- and 
hanging sort of like will it, or will it not? Wh
at™s going to happen if it does and if it

doesn ™t? It™s very difficult and I think -- I 
know we have some friends who never had 
any ch ildren, and one couple regrets it 
-- by choice. And the other couple keep s 
repeating, even to th is day, 
we™re glad we don™t have ch ild
ren. We don™t want to have 
to leave our children in such 
a terrible world, where peace is at que -- in question every 
day. And I don™t know, I -- I™m very glad 
th at I have a child, and I have, hopefully, 
continuity. But it is a questi
on to ponder. What are we le
aving our children with, when 
we cannot guarantee them freed
om, and freedom is what ev
eryone until now has paid 
such a dear price for. 

Q: You said in the -- in your oral history in
terview, you said a number of times though, 
that you feel hope. You do feel hope for humankind. 

A: Well I -- yes, I do, I still do, in spite of 
it all, because if I didn™t, I couldn™t go -- I 
never speak to the school kids, especially sc
hool kids, and adults too, without injecting 
some hope in my remarks. 
I know nobody can live with
out hope. You might as well 
give up. And I know in my  -- in -- in my
 darkest hours, no matter how I came to 
achieve it, if I tried, you know, to -- to just 
talk my self into it, but I always felt that I 
mu st have hope, and I have 
hope now. And I think, I 
mean, it™s no comp arison, but 
when my husband got so
 ill, I prayed to God and at th
at time I said, God, I -- I don™t 
care what you do, please give me hope that 
he™s going to go on a
nd he™s going to  live.

And I reme mb er a very beau tiful thing happene
d. There was a Catholic priest -- they 
have a priest and a rabbi and all at the Walter 
Reed Hospital, and this 
priest just start --  
just happened to pass when I was sitting ther
e, and I mean, I wasn™t crying, but I was 
sitting in the corner waiting for some results.
 And I was -- I looked very sad, and I think 
I was waiting for our son to come and I -- he 
says -- what -- what™s
 bothering you, my  
child? And I told him. And he says, I™ll pray
 for him he™ll be all right. Yeah. And that 
Christmas we went over and we gave him a 
nice donation. He was there for -- he™s gone 
now, he™s gone someplace else. But a Catholic priest, you know, had so much 
comp assion. That gives me hope, because th
ere is some thing good in every human 
being. And I also have another philosoph
y. You know how wo men get together and 
they start gossiping and all, and I don™t lik
e to gossip. Bu t I always say, if you don™t 
have anything nice to say, d
on™t say anything. Say only  wh
en  you have something nice 
to say, otherwise don™t. And if you feel, yo
u know, anger and all, try to concentrate and 
try to find so mething nice about that person.
 And sometimes it™s very difficult to do 
that, yeah. 

Q: I remember in your first interview you ta
 -- describing how hopeful your mother led 
you to believe -- 

A: Oh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
125
Q: -- that she was, whether or not she really was. 
A: I never saw her cry. 
Q: She was very strong. 
A: But -- but sh -- you know, sh
e turned  gray overn ight when  
they took my 
father away.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. I should go ov
er that and refresh some of what
 I said and some what I didn™t 
say. 

Q: Oh. 

A: But she -- she was - - and she wasn™t th
e only one. It seem
s that most of the 
nourishment -- nourish -- nurturing befell to th
e women, because mo st of the me n were 
gone right away. And this was his -- Hitler™s 
plan, you know, take away the leaders and 

everything will fall ap art. And that™s what
 happened. But the women came through 
gloriously. And I know my  mo ther kept sp
inning tales that -- I mean, now they are 
laughable I am sure, but everything that sh
e -- that came  out of her lips always ended 
with hope. When they 
took my father away, 
both of us cried, my  sister and I. And sh e 
gathered us -- she -- sh e hu
gged us, she didn™t say anythi
ng. And later she was making 
plans, wh at kind of a party we™ll have wh
en  Papa would come home. And, I me an, she 
always invited people, even in the ghetto, wh
en she saw a little urchin, a little b oy, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
126
or a little girl by themselves, and there were 
lots of them, she says come and we™ll eat 
something. And she was a genius at ma
king soup, and she™d add mo re water and 
whatever, I don™t know, but everything she ma
de, because we were hungry too, tasted 
so good. And it was always shared with so  mu
ch good feelings. It 
wasn™t just oh gosh, 
we don™t have anything for tomo rrow, yo
u know, but well, we™ll have something 

tomo rrow too. Enjoy it, and eat, you know. 
And it -- it was -- she gave us so much -- 
she gave me so mu ch strength. And I wish 
I could be one-tenth of the person that she 
was. And sh-she was strong, and she was very
 wise, and she wasn™t the only one. They 
-- she and a group of wo men organized a sch
ool fo r a -- for the kids who didn™t work , 
too young to  wo rk. And there again, we co
uld have lied about our age had we known 
ahead of time, but we didn™t. Bu
t this too was such a wonderful gesture, to -- to be with  
the kids. And -- and they were tired and beat
, you know, from the work
 that they did all 
day, and yet they would come with smiles 
on their faces and sing happy songs for us, 
just to keep us occupied and to give us 
something to do. Yes, 
my mother was a very 
special woman, but she wasn™t the only one. 
I think ordinary people -- and my  mo ther 
was not ordinary, she was extr
aordinary, but I think ev en ordinary  people were made 
extraordinary by their circ
umstances in the ghetto. And 
I mean, what befell us, you 
know, when the Germans came in , that peopl
e who were ordinary became heroes. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
127
that happened everywhere. That™s another 
thing th at I, nowad ays feel very strongly 
about it, and I keep learning 
much more, is the fact that 
t h ere was so much resistance, 
and there was so much -- there were upris
ings, you know, all over the place. Sobibor, 
Auschwitz, and of course, Warsaw. But I was 
reading someplace just recently that there 
was resistance in 105 different ghettos. And 
I think probably it will come up that it -- it 
was mo re than 105 ghettos. Cause my  mo ther™s
 school, that™s resistance. The -- our kids 
getting to gether, about 20 of us, building a tunne
l. Tunnel, it wasn™t really a tunnel, but 
it was a tunnel. That™s resistance. And these 
kind of fo rms of resistance took place 
almost in every little ghetto. And that is some
thing that when we 
consider that there 
was practically no help from the outside, a
nd even in -- in the 
Warsaw ghetto, how 
difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you
 know, how very -- 
even for money -- I 
mean, people would, on the outside, w
ould promise you weapons, 
and th en you would 
come and you™d find empty shells or you 
know, corroded things that didn™t wo rk . And 
when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should 

walk now with our heads high, too. And I of
ten say I™m very proud to be who I am. I 
wouldn™t change it for the world. And I am 
proud of being a Jew.
 And I am proud of 
having to sur-survive -- of 
having survived. But until rece
ntly, I had enormous guilt. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
128
Now my guilt I™m trying to rationalize and ch
ase it away. Why should I feel guilty? But 
I have felt great guilt.  
Q: Ten years ago you sa
id you felt imprisoned -- 
A: Guilt? 
Q: -- imprisoned by your 
memories, in your guilt -- 
A: Oh, I™m still imprisoned by my memories, 
but I don™t feel guilt any more. Maybe not 
-- I still feel a little b it, but not that much. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I felt enormous guilt for surviving. Wh
y me? A nobody like me when  people who 
had so mu ch  to contribute to human kind we
re just blown away like flies. Why me? So 
that™s why I feel very strongly that I mu st 
do wh at I can in my  own small way. I™m not 
Elie Wiesel, whom I met a number of times a
nd just recently had an  occasion to be at 
this table at a luncheon, which was very in
teresting. But in my  own way, I have to 
contribute what I can, and this is my contribution. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s -- I need -- I need to take
 a break for a sec -- [tape break] -- 10 years 
ago, you were still looking for answers about 
what happened to your
 father and mo ther. 
And has there been, in the 10 years -- 

A: Any resolution. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
129
Q: -- any more information? 
A: Well, you know, I went back to my hometo wn and that was a disaster. As I said, my 
sister apparently was shot then  and there, 
I don™t know what day,
 or -- but, during the 
liquidation. My father, at firs
t they told me he was -- he 
pa -- I guess the people in my  
town -- excuse me, that he went to Dachau
, the concentration -- Dach au concentration 
camp. And when  I was in th
e DP camp, and later when
 my  husband and I were 
stationed in Munich -- excuse me -- we went to Dachau to search 
all the papers. Didn™t 
find anything. And then , wh en I went in 1988 
to my hometown, I was told that the 300 
leaders were led from our hometown to  the outsid
e of the town to a -- one of the forests, 
there are lots of forests around. I don™t know 
if they kept them one day or two or three. 
They  made them dig a mass grave and then  th
ey shot them there and then. I don™t know 
which is the true story. I did not see the gr
ave. I hope before I di
e I will go back to my 
hometown and have an swers to some of th
ese burning questions. Maybe not all of 
them, but some. If there is a gr
ave, I feel that™s probably wh
ere he lost his life. I -- and 
if it™s so, I -- my aim is to put some pla
ques, memo rial plaques wh ere the ghetto was, 
which is now a leveled space, and I hope so meone will show me the mass grave, and I 
could put some memo rial plaque there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
130
Q: Do you have reason to believe 
that people there know where it is? 
A: Oh yes, they do. They
 told us they do, but we
 had no time to go there -- 
Q: Oh. 
A: -- because I was given a limit 
of two hours to be there. 
And the town was completely 
leveled. My house is still there, w h ich agai
n doesn ™t look like my house, but it was a 
very traumatic return to my
 hometown. Nothing was the wa
y  I rememb ered  it an d  mo st 
of the houses were gone and I don™t know, but 
my -- our theory is that there must have 
been some kind of a experiment which turn
ed sour. I™m not saying it was Chernobyl or 
anything, but -- I don™t know 
what it was, but something oc
curred in that little town of 
mine that leveled everything and there is not
hing there now. Wh en  we went in ™88, my  
husband tried to comfort me cause I was so ups
et with all this. He says, well, you don™t 
see anything, let™s go and sh ow me where the 
river is where you were hiding with your 
mama. And I try -- I said, I -- I 
s -- I was so disoriented, and I asked the people there, 
where™s the river? No more ri
ver, they diverted the river, too. So , I mean, everything 
was so traumatic and so puzzli
ng, to this day I don™t know 
if any of the facts or if 
anything they said is the truth, but I have 
to believe someone. But there is, th ey told me, 
a mass grave outside of the city.  

Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068
 
 
 
131
A: Yeah. I should have gone through my  st
atements from oral history, so I wouldn™t 
have probab ly repeated  my self. 
Q: That™s okay, that -- that™s okay. I -- 
I don™t have any other questions. Is there 
anything else that you feel like I missed
, or you™d want to go back over, and -- 
A: No, I think you were very
 much in detail and I thi
nk I™ve talked too mu ch  -- 
Q: No, you haven™t. 

A: -- and I don™t know if I made sense, but -- 
Q: Yeah, it™s very clear -- 

A: -- I just gave you my  feelings. 
Q: -- it™s very clear. 
A: And I tried to be clear, but some
times it gets sort of convoluted . 
Q: No, it™s great. Th
ank you very much. 
A: Thank you Neenah, so much
, for your very nice feeling th at you give me, of 
confid ence, and for being so  perceptive. Seve
ral times you told me things that I didn™t 
know how to  express and you ex pressed them for me. 
Q: Oh good. 
A: And I™m very grateful for that.
