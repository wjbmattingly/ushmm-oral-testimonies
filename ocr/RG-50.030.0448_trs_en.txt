Question: This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Dr. Ann Resnick 
conducted by Amy Rubi n on Nove mber 25, 1996, in Wa sh
ington, DC.  This is tape one, side A.  
Would you please tell me your 
name  now and at birth? 
Answer: My name  is Ann, my birth name  is He
rtzog and my ma rried name is Resnick and I  

combine it by being Ann Hertzog Resnick. 

Q: When and where were you born? 

A: I was born in Hindenberg which is consider
ed now Ger ma ny, Eastern Germany, a nd I birth 
date is stated Nove mber 1, 1939. 

Q: What was the ma ke up of your fa mily? 

A: I was born into a mi ddle to upper class family. 
 My father was a political activist, he was a 
journalist.  My mother was runni
ng a Textile distribution business.
  I had an older brother, we 
were a very well to do happy fa mily. 

Q: What are the the names 
of your family me mbers? 
A: My fathers name  was  Benjamin, my mothers 
name  was Sara, my brothers name  was Joshua. 
Q: Do you have any me mories of living in Hindenberg? 

A: I me mori es of Hindenberg are practically zero. 
 I don™t reme mber the city at all.  My father 
being a political activis
t was persecuted much earlier than 
the general Jewi sh population.  He 
was constantly in hiding and at certain times 
they would storm the house and take him away for 
short periods of time.  So they decided to esca
pe Germany a nd go to Poland and that was Eastern 
Poland where my mothers fa mily lived and also my fathers family resided in the same city.  My 

mother™s family owned a textile mill and they we
re distributors for textil
es as well as had the 
retail store.  My recollection of 
that plays a very vivid they were very happy days even for the 
fact we were displaced from our home.  My gran
dparents and the siblings of my mothers and 
father were living in a very la
rge home, within that  ther e were
 like apartments where my aunts

and uncles were living and I had a lo
t of cousins.  We  used to play
 together.  Early restrictions 
were started to impose upon us as the Germans 
were stormi ng Poland, but relatively it was a 
happy time for me. 
Q: Let me  just ask you a little bit about the ha
ppy or happier time s a
nd where exactly where you 
do you know where this was in Poland? 

A: The city was small the name  was Shotcouf and 
we were living on the out 
skirts of that city 

and the place was called Yelganetza. 

Q: So before there were to ma ny restrictions
 were you was your fa mily practicing religious 
traditions and customs? 

A: My fa mily was conservative
, we adhered to all the holid
ays.  My parents were going 
occasiona lly to the Synagogue on Saturday and 
they were considered quote unquote a cultural 
fa mily.  I learned Hebrew, I love the Hebrew songs
 and musi c and in general I was raised in the 

Jewish traditional lif
e and I loved it. 
Q: We re you mostly around 
other Jews at the time ?  
A: No not not specifically because my fa mily was 
waiting with non-Jews.  So I used to play a lot 
with all kinds of children of different faiths and 
when the restrictions were imposed upon us the 
me re fact that I couldn™t play with the non-Je
wish children made a big impact upon me.  I do 
reme mber wanting to play with a certain child that
 I like very much and prior to the war we were 
very good friends and as I approached her one day th
e mother pulled that litt
le girl away she said 
ﬁOh no you can™t play with her any more she is 
no good she is a Jewﬂ, and the little girl said 

ﬁ What is a Jew, she is my friendﬂ, and that thats 
when I really started feeling different.  It was 
also the fact that I couldn™t pl
ay on the play ground that ma inly 
our activities were restricted to 
our house, with my coursins being in the same  situ
ation it made me  already feel that some  thing 
bad is comi ng upon us.  We used to play down in 
the celler in the dark places, mainly inside the 
house. 

Q: Do you have an image of how old you were at this time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

A: I would, think five, five years, five, six ye
ars like at an age pres
chool age where you know 
were jump, hop scotching and pl
aying those type of ga me s. 
Q: So you were able to play for a while before
 everything was really disrupted and even though 
the war had already started? 
A: Well, I real yes, I, we were relatively off, better off than other families because of the fact of a 

although all the goods were confiscated and a 
business was removed and given away to non-
Jewish citizens my grandparents an
d parents were able to still hide some  of the goods and that 

way they kept up secret trades with the a farmers 
in the villages and the obtain food, in order to 
obtain food so were were not initially totally star
ving.  I reme mber we used to disguise ourselves 
a wearing shawls and peasant cloths and at ni
ght to to the villages 
and carry these good in 
exchange for food and ma ny ti me s these farmers 
would take there goods and not give us the 
far mers food and we would come  back empty ha
nded.  But I used to look forward to going on 
these excursions it was an adve
nture and for a child it was a my
steries way of sneaking through 
the dark st reets in the evening in a disguise aw
ay.  This was going on for a short period of time 
until a they were posting all ki nds of curfews and th
reat ening with being killed if we left  certain 
time.  The               wearing the white bands
 with blue star and it beca
me much more restrictive. 
Q: Did all of your norma l daily life activities then become  disrupted? 

A: Yes, that when when gradua
lly gradually newer restrictions 
were announced and I reme mber 
still the sound the drums where at a city empl
oyee would come out and run to a square city 
square and listen to the announcements.  What 
we  can do and what we can not do and all the 
restrictions and so on so.  It it
 it became  gradually more difficu
lt to live, also big impact on us 
when they started bringing Jews from different
 countries like Hungry.  Suddenly they brought 

hundreds of Jews and into the synagog where 
they camped out there and these people were 
poorly ma lnourished.  They have no food they have
 no clothing they have to leave suddenly, and 
thats when we realized that a actually there is
 a war and that we are going to be involved, by 
probably being displaced also. 

Q: Where you frightened at this time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

A: I was I, can not describe the feeling of a child
 the because I just expe rienced these restrictions 
as a ma tter of fact.  This is what it is you 
can™t go to school, you can™t play, you can™t you don™t 
have much food, you can™t go outside on certain da
ys.  You the windows have to be shut, the 
doors have to be shut.  We we each me mber of 
the family was assigned to sit guard behind the 
window.  Lets say 12 hours a day there was a exch
ange each me mber was taking a turn and there 

was fear.  There was anxiety and there was an
 air of uncertainty.  You didn™t know what 
tomorrow might bring.  It it it was a kind of a day 
to day life, mo me nt to
 mome nt really.  Along 
with restrictions I know they for m a Unionrod wh
ich was a collection of elders and my my uncle 
was part of that.  Unionrod and through him we 
were learning some  of the horrors that were 

going on in the larger cities not to distant from 
us.  There was our only co
nnection to the outside 
world. 

Q: What did your parents tell 
you or what did they try to 
explain to you at this time? 
A: They didn™t, they did not tell me  much.  I us
ed to hear, stories of the old good days when the 
Kaiser was alive.  World war one and the excite
me nt then they the exciteme nt adventures of 
wars and I kind of thought that was a really neat 
thing to be able to wonder from country to 
country and a see soldiers fighting and so on.  And 
so I imagined that to be the same way.  Little 
did I know that this war was going 
to be directed against me .  My
 image of a war was soldiers 
against soldiers not soldiers ag
ainst children.  We  really were
 not, as children we were not 
prepared for anything realistic th
e adults probably knew and I used to hear them talk about 

killings and death and so on but, as ch
ildren we did not know what to expect. 
Q: Did you hear anything about Hitler specifically? 

A: Oh, yes that was mentioned a lot and I reme mb
er the adults talking 
why doesn™t Roosevelt do 
some thing about it.  And more why doesn™t the wo rld organize against Hi
tler and why don™t they 
try to to to help us to get out of this mise
ry here.  But thats as 
far as I could understand. 
Q: Where you living in a getto in
 Chorkof, or you were alwa ys outside the town of Chorkof? 
A: We were living outsid
e Chorkof at at only for a brief period
 of time.  What happened was that 
soon after they for med the Unionrod we heard of
 Acktunin an action being a a being performe d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448  
5 
 
 
in all cities around us.  Well one day my uncle cam
e running from that Unionrod screaming at us 
to disberse some thing terrible is going to happe
n.  He didn™t know what but nothing good and to 
run away, just get out of th
e house I don™t want to see you.  
That was the beginning of the 
extermination of our town.  I reme mb er my mothe r
 grabbed me  she said ﬁLets go lets runﬂ, some  
of the other me mbers ran down the we had a ve
ry big celler and they ran down there and my 
mother grabbed me  and said ﬁLets go.ﬂ  So we we
nt outside of the city fa lling on our floor until 
we reached some far m farmers houses we heard shot
s very soon, very near by we hid in stacks of 
hay from house to house and the shots were comi ng 
closer and closer , we knew we had to move 
fast, we could only move  at night or in the da
rk.  We crawled to house 
until we started hearing 
voices, these were Jewish me mbers of the city 
carring dead bodies to a near by cemetery.  We  
kept on moving farther and farther away until the lamenting shots became much more distant and 
pretty soon quieted down.  We  stayed in a hay 
stack at a farmers house over night.  The space 
was so small and so tight, that I reme mber 
laying there over night
 doubled over until early 
morning when the farmers left for the fields.  We
 crawled out of there and the bright day light 
really blinded us and we stretched out and was pr
etty quite and peaceful and then we decided to 
move back to watch the town.  We  came backand a deadly silence greeted us there wa s blood 

and dead bodies in the street.  And we cam
e back to our house and the house was totally 
ransacked the windows were broken, there was n
obody there, we sat on the floor.  Pretty soon 
some me mbers emerged from the celler and th
ey were telling us how the Germans we re 
searching homes and killing people and lucky they didn™t di scover them in the celler.  My father 

who used to be in hiding all the time  escaped last
 mi nute and hid in a village.  And then when he 
returned, upon his return he was su
re that we were all killed.  
My uncle who was in the Unionrod 
was a witness to all these killings and death.  At
 that time my brother 
who a was not a direct 
me mber of the Unionrod, but my unc le use to
 keep around him there because he thought it a 
much safer place.  Wa s taken from the Unionrod and he was ma de to gather all the de ad bodies 

into the villages square and then he was lined 
up and taken away with the transport.  Later on 
some  of the far mers was telling us they st
ood and watched and they saw the Jews ma r c hing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

towards the railway station and they saw my 
brother along side my grandfather march along 
without a speigel to their death. 
 My uncle described the scene wh
en they lined them up he was 
pointing with his sad eyes towards him like ma king 
a gester rescue me , get me  out of this line, 
but he couldn™t.  One of the Jewish elders tried 
to pull away a little gi rl  
out of the line, his own 
litle daughter, and he was shot on the spot.  Afte
r that and a few other action occured, they wiped 
out the total town.  The few le
ft over people and among them we 
were part of the left over 
population was transported to
 a city called Lutrouch. 
Q: I just want to ask you a li
ttle bit more about your brother,
 can you tell me  what kind of 
relationship you had had with him before he was taken away? 
A: My brother was older than I quite a few y
ears I don™t know totally how ma ny for sure like 
five and I always looked up to him, he was like my
 God.  For a child I used to love to brush his 
cloths and shine his shoes, looki
ng for his approval and he wa s joining always organizations like 
Sha mar Zier, and I always love when he took 
me by his hand, took me  to these me etings.  I 
reme mber Saturdays when he took me  there, 
there was always singing going on and he was a 
very good student and in school and he used to tu
tor other children and I always go along with 
him and he play the violin and I always hope
 that some  day I would, it was a very close 
relationship. 

Q: How did you react to heari
ng that he was taken away? 
A: I was totally devastated, I kind of refused to be
lieve he™s really dead.  I always have the image 
that he escaped some where from a train.  I went
 into total isolation, I did not speak to anybody, I 
wore black cloths.  As a child I 
associated that already with black
 cloths, I wouldn™t eat, I just 
totally went into morning more than any adult. 
 It was a devastating experience for me  and I 
totally refused to acknowledge th
at he™s not there.  I reme mb er
 even some  how get a hold of a 
piece of choc olate, I don™t know how it ever came to my hands, I refuse to eat it I was saving it 

when he come s back for him.  

Q: Do you think that hearing about him being killed, 
made you more afraid at that time.  Did that 
change any of your feelings a
bout the war and the war time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

A: I really didn™t hear that he 
was killed.  I knew that ﬁThey we
re taken away to camps.ﬂ  And 
the adults knew that there was no return from 
those camps, but I as a child refused to believe 
that.  My image was alwa ys that  he escaped and he
 will come back.  As far as fear I personally, I 
can not describe the feelings of f
ear. It was a life of living from 
mo ment to moment and I I I just 
have never had that feeling of fear.  I felt that 
I have to meet what come s and any challenge that 
will come I should surmount it.  It is amazing to me
 that as a child during those times before this 
action and this devastating acti
on that took place, my ma in con
cern and regret was I couldn™t go 
to school.  I couldn™t play, I couldn™t go to nur
sery school that was my
 ma in depravation I 
experienced during those years.  Not so much food 
lack of food or lack of 
cloths it was more lack 
of freedom, lack of playing of 
interaction of other children. 
Q: Had you gone to school at all by this time? 

A: I had gone to a little nursery school, which I re
me mber just a play school.  As far as learning 
to read, I was all taught by osmose
s, my father used to read to
 me because he was in hiding I 
would go down in the cellar.  He 
would read to me , he would sing 
songs to me , tried to teach me  
Russian.  That was my main e
ducation was underground education. 
Q: What languages were you speaking? 

A: I was speaking German and Polish not as flue
nt and then my father taught me  Rus s ian, and 
some  Hebrew.  Ya I remember he taught me  al
so Hebrew songs, poetry and Russian poetry, he 
read me  instead of children stories, he read me  stories tell st
ories                       Thats what I grew 
up upon, war and crime and that kind of 
thing, and not Cinderella stories. 
Q: When you were near this town Shortkof, di
d you experience any contact with Germans or did 
you experience any anti Se mitism yourself? 

A: Oh yes, yes very much so, even as a child 
I knew I was different, even at nursery school.  

There was a time ﬁReligionﬂ and we as Jews w
ould not, as Jewish children would not go, that 
hour we had to stay out and that 
by itself ma de us  feel different 
and bad.  I personally was treated 
a little bit better and I don™t understand why ma ybe because my fa mily was more influential.  In 

the area I wa s well known but I used
 to hear all the time Shid Sh
id, which in Polish is Jew and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448  
8 
 
 
felt a different treatme nt by the teachers, I definite
ly saw that  I more rejoiced in fact in the 
Hebrew language and the Hebrew 
spirit and didn™t dwell muc h of
 the other side of the a being 
ma ltreated as a Jew. 
Q: Did you ever go to your parents and ask them 
about being called a Jew in that wa y, in that 
derogatory way? 

A: I just absorbed it, I didn™t, I didn™
t ask questions.  I learned it on my own. 
Q: Did you have friends and were they always Jewish? 

A: No and that thats when I started feeling that
 there was different, I 
had Jewish and non-Jewish 
friends.  I had a lot of friends and I wa s a leader. 
 When we were playing I was always the leader 
and I started feeling this difference by the non-
Jewish friends turning against me , and I even 
reme mber the farmers or the villagers used to co
me  to take some  of the goods from us and some  
of the children would come  along.  Later on thos
e children would turn away and wouldn™t speak 
to me , gee why you come to take all of our goods
 and you still dispise us and don™t like us.  One 
of these little girls said ﬁBecause your Jew and no goodﬂ, I did feel that badly but I ha d to ma ke 

it out on my own and understand it on my own. 

Q: You were starting to that you were 
then taken to a ghetto in Bochoch? 
A: We  were ordered to within four hours to l
eave the town, take what you can in your hands and 
out.  I think we were taken into a horse and wagons
 and driven to we didn™t know where we were 
going and after some hours we arrived at this to
wn was a very depressing place.  I reme mber 
comi ng in a wagon there were cobble stone streets 
was no lights, houses were dark  the streets 
were filthy and smelling, gray cobble stone and we
 were taken to a house, which was like a two 
story house, there were some  inha
bitants there already.  There wa
s a dark corridor there were a 
few rooms assigned to families, there were like ei
ght to 14 people to a room and there was like a 
communal type of a life.  There was a two stor
y house there was only one bathroom on the lower 
floor and I reme mber the lines they used to be 
lined up for that bathroom.  I was always thought 
gee what if some one was constipated
 and got stuck there and all these 
people still waiting in line.  
In a way it wasn™t totally totally a destructive life there because we lived together  because there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

were some  childre n fr om diffe rent fa milies that we  interacted right away.  Except now we started 
to experience food shortage and muc h more 
limited freedom of move ment.  We were not 
allowed to leave that house, toward evening one
 me mber of a  room snuck out and brought back 
some food.  I reme mber that ther
e wa s like a black ma rket and my 
father did not look Jewish at 
all and he would be the one to leave the house 
and venture out, he grew a beard and mustache 
and looked very much Aryan.  And he would co
me  back and bring food.  Many a time we didn™t 

know if he was going to come  back because he
 could have been caught.  I still reme mber 
specifically in those times me mbers were appointed 
to sit guard, and I wa s a 
little bit older and I 
was to sit with an adult, looking out through th
e crack in the window, wh
ich was totally covered 
with a sheets, looking out across the street was theAryan side.  And I used to children walk and 

children play and I just couldn™t 
imagine through a children™s eye wh
at it would be for me  to be 
able to go across there and just walk.  That
s when I really st arted to experience  
[end of side one, tape 1] 

Q: Would you continue to tell me a little bit abou
t your experiences shortl
y after you were in the 
ghetto and how it felt for you? 

A: By being thrown into that open ghetto, I, 
and being totally limited to
 a certain place, while 
looking out the window and seeing th
e other side across the street, 
which was the Aryan side and 
seeing people walk freely and child
ren playing and I was totally isol
ated and deprived of the sun 
and the moon.  I started to understand whatit meant to be a Jew under the Nazi regime . 

Q: We re you worried for your life or fo
r your family's lives at that time? 
A: At that time  we, I specificall
y, became aware that life is ve ry finite and we actually are in 
danger of losing our lives in th
e days or weeks to come .   
Q: How old do you think you were at the time , what
, what's your image of yourself at the time? 
A: My, I cannot specify my age but my i mage 
of, was that of a 10 year old, going on 25, very 
serious about life and death.  I 
saw my grandmother die and she 
died a natural death on the bed 
and we, in our home nobody spoke about death.  I re
me mber that night, the children we re placed 
in one room only, I guess to protect us from 
the visual image of a 
person actually dying and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

taking the last breath.  And the 
adults and the children, the, my
 mother's brothers and sisters 
gathered that night around the bed and we heard 
the heavy breathing of my  grandmother, but we 
didn't say anything, we just lay th
ere motionless and I cannot speak 
for what the others heard, but 
I still reme mber now, it becomes so vivid in my 
mi nd, the way she was really gasping for the last 
breath and I reme mber my father, who was he
r son-in-law, asking for forgiveness and I 
reme mber her asking, "Why, you didn't do anything 
wrong, I have nothing to forgive you."  It's  
the first time that I really speak 
of that.  And I remember as a 
child hearing that.  Nobody spoke 
anything about it and the followi
ng day, naturally it couldn't be funeral, but I reme mb er my 
uncle, her son and some other men from the hous
e were carrying her body wrapped in a white 
sheet.  I did not know, we were 
not told where they were going and what they are going to do 
with the body and we never knew whether they we
re going to come  back alive because they had 
to leave the compound.  This was the first time  
that I spoke about it.  Li fe went on, very 
restricted, if you can call it life. 
 My father came to realize that it's time to do something about 
survival and his features were 
not Jewish and he grew a must
ache and he looked totally Aryan, 
so he used to escape out of this restrict
ed compound to venture on the outside and as I 
me ntioned, to bring us food.  One day he took 
the freedom of leaving for a day and wandered 
into a village and it was Easter
 day, Easter morning.  While wa
ndering through this village and 
trying to get some  food, he started 
to be suspected as a Jew.  At 
least he was a foreigner there, 
nobody knew hi m, said, "What are you doing here, so
me thing suspicious about you."  So he 
started running to different areas,
 where he found hims elf on Easter 
morning in front of a church.  
The me mbers of the church were 
let out after the Easter sunr ise 
ceremony and he was so deep in 
pain and so much alone, that his heart started cr
ying and he started singing Ailee, ailee(ph), the 
song from Yom Kippur services, with a loud, stro
ng voice.  He used to love to sing.  The 
Christians walked out and started asking, 
"Who a r e you and why are you singing here, why 
didn't you go inside?"  And he started saying, "M
y voice sounds better on the outside and didn't 
you hear the priest sing that? "   And these pe
ople stood around and listening to his singing and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

then walking away, nodding their heads.  It was 
ironic that he was a Je
w, hiding his identity, 
singing a, a holy Jewish song in fr
ont of a Christian audience.   
Q: When he came back and told you about that 
incident, was he very worried about going out 
again?   We re you very worried about him?  
A: We  were worried, but we couldn't sit and philo
sophically worry.  By being on the outside, he 
was more in touch with reality.  He picked up me
ssages, he knew that the war is comi ng closer 
and closer.  And when he returned from the outsi
de, he knew that some thing has to be done and 
started to organize the men in
 the compound to build bunkers, hi
ding places.  So, immediate 
action was taken to build bunkers within th
e big house or compound.  They organized and 

searched the house and the ground and finally they
 found what they thought
 was a great tunnel 
under the house and constructed a rock that blocke
d off a certain area.  And that was deep tunnel 
leading to nowhere, that's what they thought 
and for days they were digging and constructing 
that bunker.  At the same place they built some 
alternate places, hiding pl aces.  One day, very 
soon, the guard, quote unquote, the 
guard, was sitting in front of
 the windows spotted some  
activity going on on the street with Ge rman sold
iers popping out on the corners.  The signal was 
given for us to run to the bunker.  It wa s amazing th
at prior to that we used to practice every day, 
how fast we, it has to take for us to run down 
the stairs and climb up those rocks and one elder 
was standing and timing us.  Well, time ca me to
 hide and we started hearing shots.   Pe ople 
became panicky and one was climbing up on the ot
her too fast, enter that bunker and moved the 
rocks.  I remember there were sick peopl
e on the second floor and nobody could carry them 
down, cause everybody was running towards the bunker 
and they were left in their beds.  The 
place was very small and the people were crowde d together, there was nowhere to mo ve, you 

couldn't breathe.  But unfortunately it didn't last
 long, pretty soon we heard, started hearing shots 

and German voices shouting rousse
(ph), rousse(ph), which meant ge
t out, get out.  We couldn't 
believe that they discovered us so soon, we were 
so convinced that this wa s such a safe  bunker.  
What it turned out to be is th
at the tunnel was leading across 
the street underground, below some  
of the stores on the Aryan side 
and there was the barber shop a
nd when we were digging that

tunnel, they used to hear the voi
ces of the Jewish people building 
that bunker and as soon as this 
action star ted, the barber right away notified theGermans and the Polish militia, that there were 
Jews hiding right underneath andthey came straight, without havi
ng to search long.  They found 
the rock, they opened the rock and urged us to
 come  out, but nobody would move, so they started 
shooting into the bunker and throwing some  gas ro
ckets, whatever it was.  People started to 
move back, towards the wall, there was scr
eaming of children, people bleeding from these 
wounds inflicted upon them by the shots.  Therewere a few sick people laying right near the 

entrance, they were shot on the spot.  And I 
reme mber pulling my mo m and my dad and said, 
"Let's go."  And even at that mo me nt, I was th
inking of my brother and I said, "Let's go, we'll 
join now Joshua."  On the way out they were
 beating everybody with clubs.  People became 
disoriented.  There was blood running through their f
aces.  They were lined, these soldiers were 
lined out along the corr idor, lining 
up the people and beating them at
 the same  ti me , so they will 
be, came so helpless and disoriented and did not o
ffer any resistance.  Any 
resistance would have 
been me t with a bullet anyhow, so there was no 
point.  I remember spotting my uncle, standing 
there and his blood was dripping from his head an
d we could not do anything and we were ready 
to go.  I stood with my parents and I spotted 
a door and I tried the door and it cracked opened 
and I pulled my mother and she says, "Why are 
you pulling me?"  I said, I pointed with my 
finger, with my thumb, "Go over there, go over." 
 And then I pulled my fa ther and then I, I 
pulled them in and we went up the stairs, we we
nt up the stairs and th
ere were bodies laying up 
there on the bed, with the blood dripping down and 
went into a room and each of us hid under 
the bed in a puddle of blood.  And then we h
eard the lame nting voices from downstairs and 

pretty soon it became mo re quiet.  Suddenly we 
heard footsteps running up the stairs and a voice 
saying in Polish, "I saw you runni
ng up there, I know you are hidi
ng.  Stay under the bed until it 
become s quiet and then go down and hide again." 
 And he disappeared.  As it became quiet we 
emerged from under the beds and we went into a di
fferent hiding that my fa
ther constructed.  It 
was located on top of a toilet which pretended to
 be like a ceiling.  Pretty soon the Germans and 
the Polish militia returned with some  other ci tize
ns, to remove the dead bodies and to do a last 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

mi nute search.  They entered the toilet room 
whe r e we were hiding a
nd instead of looking up, 
they looked down and there was a child that fe
ll through the toilet seat, it was a constructed 
toilet, not like we have here and this child was 
deep in feces and the soldiers were st anding there 
and laughing and one said, "Don't 
waste a bullet, she'll drown in 
the feces anyhow, " and walked 
away.  We  rema ined breathless up on top, until 
all the bodies were removed and the doors were 

closed.  Later we emerged from our hiding and th
ere were a few other people that survived in 
that same room. 

Q: Who had you been living with 
first of all, in the ghetto? 
A: My parents, my mother's fa mily and my fath
er's brothers and there were people from other 
parts of different, other parts of 
cities and different villages that 
were brought there, into that 
compound.  It wasn't  a really compound 
of ma ny houses, it wa s one huge house. 
Q: How ma ny people were livi
ng in the one house with you? 
A: There were like, total I thi
nk there were 120 and about, I think 
the ma jority, I think 90 percent 
were wiped out, killed off duri
ng that one actione(ph).  I reme mber as it quieted down, these 

people were ma rched out, the outside
 of the city, but not too far 
away and there was a ma ss grave 
being dug by some of the militia people, and all 
our fa milies, there was, _____, the other people 
from that compound and other compounds in the ghetto, were shot into that ma ss grave.  That's 

where most of our fa mily was killed.  There were
 only four members, out of about a total of 45 
o r  5 0  fa mi l y  me mb e r s  r e ma i n e d .  

Q: Who wer e  the ones surviving? 

A: Surviving was myself and my pa
rents and one of my uncles.   

Q: Had you seen dead bodies like that before? 

A: Never, no.  No, only I heard it from descriptio
n.  When they had the first actione(ph) in our 
little city _____, but I've never b
een in a trapped bunker.  I've ne
ver seen people falling right in 
front of me , shot to death.  I've never seen 
people laying in bed with 
the blood dripping down on 
me .  This was a horrible experience.  But even du
ring that experience, I did not lose my strength 
and will to survive.  Beca use it was this little 
girl that really sa ved her pare nts, by being alert 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448  
14 
 
 
enough to recognize and realize that 
this door was an opening to a life
 or to at least an escape for 
this time . 
Q: What did you do immediatel
y after this actione(ph)? 
A: We ll, as we were lucky enough to escape the s
econd time  in that toilet
, hiding, we stayed in 
that house for a day or two until everything quiete
d down and pretty soon [pause], we rema ined 
in the house, all the four
 of us, wondering what's  going to ha
ppen next.  We did not rema in for 
long alone.  Few days after this
 total destruction, new transpor
ts were comi ng in from nearby 
cities and vi llages.  These were new resettlers
.  The house was filled again with Jews from all 
over the area.  Some  urban, some  rural, people 
that had only in common by being persecuted by 
the Nazis because of being Jewish.  They came fro
m all walks of life.  We befriended one fa mily 
that was a farming, a Jew from a farm that had a 
little girl my age and we became  friends.  My 
father, being again mobile and circling around the 
non-Jewish quarters, was 
aware that the war is 
comi ng to an end and this is a time, a final actio
n that they final soluti
on of the Jewish question 
is in sight.  And his only way of escape would be 
to do it now, otherwise we are doome d to die.  
We were lucky enough that we were
 able to save gold and silver 
coins that we carried in our 
clothing, hidden in seams.  And my father appr
oached this, befriended a family, his name  was 
Abraham and told them that he would offer hi m money in order for both of the fa milies to 

escape.  His idea was, because Abraha m knew all 
these farmers and had such great faith in his 
village, that  he would send Abraham to fi nd a hidi
ng place.  The plan was to divide our fa milies 

so that in case somebody's killed, one me mber at 
least, will remain.  Abraham went back to the 

far m and was to come  up with three hi ding places.  He left, but we never knew whether he would 

return or  not.  After some time he did return
 and announce that he found a place and the children 
would go first.  Thus it was deci
ded that I and his little girl w
ould follow him.  The eve of one 
day, we were to follow Abraham through fields
 and paths, through fo
rests, moving forward 
through the night and hiding in the fields during the day, in orde
r not to be spotted by far ming 
people in the fields.  We  crawled on our four
, until Abraham decided that he was going to 
venture out and find a farming house and we stayed 
in the fields until he  returns.  The two little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448  
15 
 
 
girls rema ined laying there, waiting for Abraham 
to return.  It took days til he returned and 
announced that he found a place, we ought to follow 
hi m and just run into a barn, in towards the 
evening, without telling anybody or 
speaking to anybody.  That night 
he let us into a barn, we 
climbed up on a high stack of hay and Abraham s a id 
goodbye to us and left us there.  And if, if 
we only knew that we are in a barn, but we 
had no concept where we were, we had no image 
whether this was a city, a villag
e, a town, a far mer's house.  We had no concept what's on the 
outside.  We  could only tell day fr
om night by the sound of the environment, like the crack of the 
dawn, the rooster, the rooster w
ould crow, or towa rds the evening 
the farmers would return from 
the fields.  The only other being was the horse in
 the barn and we knew day from night when the 
horse would return from work in the field.  A
nd the morning when the farmer would c o me  and 
feed the horse and get him ready to go to the field.  

Q: What did you bring with you when you 
left the ghetto to go into hiding? 
A: We brought nothing.  We could 
not carry anything, we had to crawl on our feet and hands and 
we certainly could not carry anything.  We  re
ma ined laying on top of that high stack of hay, 
which was piled up, up to the roof of the barn.  
Our food consisted of a morning ration of water 
and a piece of dry bread.  The fa
rme r  would bring the water, a buc
ket of water to feed the horse 
and out of that he poured some  for us.  He ha
d a hiding place for the ladder and he would quickly 
assemble the ladder and with a sound, with a sign
al of a cough, he would approach the haystack 
and quickly place the, some  wate
r and a piece of bread and immediat
ely descend.  This repeated 
itself at night.  The only change of meal was 
on a holiday or a Sunday, where instead of water, 
we would get some  milk.  We  could hear the chil
dren outside playing in 
the yard and we were 
never sure whether they were going to run into th
e barn and play, although the farmer ma de sure 
that the ladder is not in si ght. 
 The only companion was the horse.
  We  laid stretched out on the, 
on top of that  haystack, two little girls, covered 
under a blanket that  blended in with the hay, not 

speaking to each other in order to conserve ener
gy.  We  could not stand up, there was room only 
to sit or lay and thus was our da
ys going, flowing in from da y to 
day.  We could not tell time, we 
could not tell season, we 
just existed up there.

Q: How long do you think you were
 in hiding in that place? 
A: I cannot tell.  I really can't . 
 I don't know if it was months, or more than a month, or weeks, no 
concept.  
Q: Did you think about your parents a lot? 

A: We were, but we had other th
ings that were happening.  We we
re both alternating at night to 
retrieve our food, by crawli
ng forward towards the haystack and one
 night I, it was my turn to do 
so and I reached out for the bucket and reach
ed too far and by holding the piece of bread, 
tumbling over and falling off that big haystack.  
The horse, hearing that noise, got up and ma de a 
lot of commotion.  I laid there 
and cold, bleeding, the floor was cement.  Lisa, my fr iend up there 
could not help me , we could not speak, not ma ke
 noise.  The farmer came in and saw me laying 

there and did not say anything, just
 walked out again, in order not 
to arouse suspicion.  We , I 
wondered what is going to happen.  I couldn't mo
ve.  The following day the farmer came back 
and placed a ladder, motioning for me to climb back
 up.  I was too much in pain that I couldn't 
move, he'd finally found some  kind of harness th
at placed me  in it and pulled my up and thus 
returned me to the top of the hi
di ng place.  After that he let Abra
ham know that he wants us out.  
Q: Can I ask you a few questions ab
out being in hiding?   You said 
that you didn't want to arouse 
suspicion by talking, but did you ev
er talk with your friend who you 
were right next to, all that 
time? 

A: Not, I don't re me mbe r  any talking going on between
 us at all, we were
 just laying quietly, I 
guess sharing each other's pain and dr eams. 

Q: What were you dreaming about? 

A: Some day, I reme mbe r  dreaming of having, imagining a bowl of soup and a ma tzo ball 

floating on it and that's justifying swallo
wing that dry piece of bread and water. 

Q: We re you thinking a lot about food?  
 What else were you thinking about? 
A: At that time , I think most of the time  we we
re, I was just imagining a hot meal.  I could not 

think of anything else. 

Q: What about being around th
e horse, what was that like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448  
17 
 
 
A: The horse  became our savior  and our guardia
n angel.  We  were always, I was always 
wondering whether he understood, they knew what
 was going on, but in certain ways he 
protected us from being thrown out of the barn.  
He formed a shield that 
night when I fell off and 
I was sure that the farmer was going to throw me  out
 that  night, just throw me into the fi elds and 
the horse ga thered some  hay around me , laid dow
n, e mbraced me  half-circle and I laid down on 
top of him, feeling the wa rmth of his body and, a
nd the warm breath and the soft, friendly eyes, 
as if he were saying, "I'm not going to let you di
e."  And he refused to eat and drink until the 
far mer would place me  back on the ha ystack and 
leave us some  food, and only then he drank his 
portion.

Wo uld you conti

in this bar n  
including the  na me .  Di d you
 give  the hors e a  na me?  
Ans wer: No, we  di d not .   We did 
not  and we didn™t, we neve r spoke
 to the horse, 
was the far mer  
used to, the time when he  placed 
our r ation up on t he bar n, he  used
 to us e hi s c onv
ersation with the 
hors e a s a  di sgui se for the noise  
that he wa s ma ki ng plac ing t he la dd

exchanged glances at each ot her and the, t he eyes
, they were  so sympat he

war m towar ds us .  We  kne w t hat  we
 had a  frie nd in t hat horse .    
Q: The far mer was not Je

A: Cor r ect .  The far mer 
wa s not Je wish a nd oddl y 
enough, in all thes e da ys
 whe n he wa s bri ngi ng

The moment  had t o be sei zed j ust at the right ti

Q: Were you scar ed a lot

some body walking i nto t he 
barn and suspecting someth
ing.  And as a matter 
of fa ct, that™s wh at 
happened.  Through some  my sterio
us wa y, the far mer, not beknown 
t o us or t o hi msel f beca me a 
sus pect of hi ding, quote unquote, 
hiding J e ws.  One day when he wa

sudde nly he ard some suspici ous sounds , loud s o und
s of mili tia appr oac h ing the bar n .  Wi t hin a 
mo ment or t wo, we r eali zed t hat
 this is danger lurking right be
hind the barn an
d what do we do?  
Wit h a glance at each ot
her we kne w t hat we  have t o e sca pe
 and how do you escape? There™s no 
ladder a nd we are wa y up high there a nd t hos e voi c
es ar e comi ng cl ose r  and 
closer .  We jumped off 
that big high haystac k a n d by s o me mira cle we  got
 up fr om that cold ston
e fl oor and ran t hrough 
hal f- ope n door a nd be hind a not her ha ystac k a nd t he ya

mo ment as we went thr
ough that yard, the militia 
was approaching the gate 
and entered the barn. 
The r e was l oud noi ses a nd si ngi ng a nd voice s of joy 
ass u ming that the y a r e gonna cat ch us .  We ll  
we were ri ght behi nd.  The y r an i nt o the far me r ™s

We i n tur n laid in t he field.  It was  broa d da

cornfields.  We  laid ther e until the evening approac

fr om the village, yet by

goi ng too fa r  we™d have , we
 would ha ve l ost  our way bac k t o t h

He came and sat t her e at

 maybe they took us aw
ay and killed us in the fi elds.  He sat in 
that barn quiet, assu ming that th
e farmer will come in 
and he did but his only 
greeting was that to 
take us away, right away 
he will not subject hi

 wanted us out.  Despite  
all the pleading, Ab

agreed to wait ‚til Abra

come back.  We  did not 
know what to expect.  We 
thought maybe he was kille
d.  However, after a 
fe w days , Abra m ca me bac k and took us.  He took 
us to, not  find, not be ing to abl e  to fi nd a ne w  
hiding place, he divided us
 up and took us to wher
e my parents were and to ok his little girl to wher e 
he wa s hidi ng at .  I was very weak a n d quite  ill  
and it  di d me  well be s t

Q: Wh at was it like to see them?  
A: It was a s hoc k beca us e I mys el f di d not se e my

I looked.  I wa s shoc ked by t heir a p peara nce i n

Q: Had you known t hat  t hey were  als o i n hidi ng?  

A: Yes .  It wa s a plan ne d situati
on t hat we knew that they were

and we had no concept of the geogr

.  But we did know that they

He took it a nd the n ne xt  day change d his mind. 

He said, ﬁ Y ou gotta go.ﬂ  And so 
a gain, Abr a m wa s ca ught bet wee n having t o ta ke us out of t his  

hidi ng pla ce  and not fi nding 
anothe r.  We wer e  c h as

turning cold and winter 
snow was  on the  gr ound.  I wa s very
 weak, practically unable to walk and Abra m was just tryi ng to 
help by fi ndi ng another place which wa

we spotted a dark

out by lea vi ng us  on t he  snow 
and movi ng forward to examine 
what it was, came back few feet , 
telling us that it looked like it™s a

This time there was neither a hors

ained t o us that he had a cow t hat  
died bec a use  he c oul d not  fe ed her so he had no mi l
k.  Hi s cr op died in t hat c old we athe r and he ha d 
no bread and the gold that 
we gave hi m was  no a v ail to hi m be cau
s e he could not  go i nt o t he ma rke t 
to buy a nything beca us e he was know

area .  So on a Sunda y we would  
have some potatoes but he was so
 poor t hat he  couldn™t a ffor d  
any salt.  But he wa s good- heart ed  
and really sympathized with
 our fate.  For so
me time we stayed there un
til one day we heard shots .  
The se wer e  very dist ant and we did not pa y muc h 
attenti on unt il the far me r  ca me a nd s ai d, ﬁ D o you 
know the war™s approaching.  The 
Russians ar e comi ng near er and n
ear er and t hey are beati ng t he 
Ger ma ns  and you™r e goi ng t o be fr

.  We  cont inued t o re mai n i n 
the same position, very pessi mistic
 and doubting 
whether we would ever ge
t out alive from these 
place s.  One  night, we h
eard ver y c l ose shots .  Pr
ior to those shots, we 
hear d t his l a me nting of 
huma n bei n gs was was ,  whi c h was 
so painful, was like these lamen
ting cats that someti me cry at 
night.  It was so close that wethought that it™s approa chi ng us  and 
soon e n gul f us in it.  I re me mber  
thinking is this how you 
die, by he aring  t hes e voic es c o ming 
out of nowhere? Pret
ty soon, we hear d 
some voi ces  knocki ng, s o me
 sound knocki ng at t he  
door of t he far mer™s  house a nd l ater we lear ned  
that Abraham, his littl
e girl and his wife , at th
e last minute prior to the 
Russian Army  approaching  
the village, were taken out by one of
 the farmers that they were hidi
ng at.  Abram and his wife and 
daught er we re dr agged out into t he 
open fiel d, cl ose t o t h
is  fa r me r™s house  and 
s hot  to deat h.  Thus  
was the end of Abraham after all 
these wanderings.  After all thes
e  nar r ow e sca pes ,  the  frie ndl y 
far mer, the farmer that Abraham 
fed and provide

 his own quot e unquote fr

that was t ota lly a str anger  to us , our fa r me r , e xpl ai ne
d t o us t ha t  the knocki ng at the door  was one of 
the militia men that asked 
him to go out and 
bury those bodies.  The fa
r mer described these three 
bodies laying in blood and the 
blood was still warm, melting the wh
ite snow.  And 
the ground was 
so froz en tha t  he coul dn™ t  dig any hole s.  After whil
e, he just had to leave 
them there and cover them 
up with the snow.  Days after, the 
farmer came back to the barn sayi
ng, ﬁ Y ou know, t he end is here . 
The Ru ssians are comi ng.ﬂ  We did no
t believe it.  He said
, ﬁ Look, you c an c o me
 into my  house.ﬂ 
His house really consisted of one 
room where five people were living,
 thr e e chil dre n a nd his wi fe.  
His wife was ill and was in
 bed.  But we did not da
re leave that barn until
 one knock at the doo r  
convinced us that fr eedom is her e. 
 He came i n, the far mer  came i n, 
just refused to 
close that door 
and dragge d that, dra gge d us into t he hous e.  By th
en, s oldi ers ca me in a nd he explai ned us that t h e  
Russia ns a r e  here .  The Russia ns i n
deed wer e there.  They wer e 
frie ndl y.  M y fat h er, tea chi ng 
hi msel f the Russia n l angua ge , st art ed ta lki ng t o 
them with tears in his eyes.  My mother , I 
re me mber, wa s kis sing their hands 
and t he Rus sian s ol diers  wer e patti ng her sayi ng, ﬁ Devi e (ph), 
devi e (ph) ,ﬂ whi ch mea n s no, no, don™
t have to do that.  We ar e here
 to libe r ate you.  And the n the y 
saw me and they lifted 
me up and said indeed, that™s a yehvoos

little girl.  They 
sa w tha t  we barel y were  breat hing a n d e mbrace d us

for departur e.  We kne w t hat we c oul dn™t  sta y  
in t hat house any longer
, that we had to move 
for ward be c ause the batt lefield was r i ght t here . 
 The r e were  bombs e xpl od

Russians dropped us off at the ne

ite the fact that quo
te unquote we were 
liberat ed, the  danger was lurki ng behi nd ea ch a nd

very frie ndl y to s urvivors .  The y we

village.  At one moment, a, one of 
the villagers lifted his,
 an ax, trying to chop 
off our heads, when a 
Russian tank rolled by an
d noticed that and shot 
the man on the spot.  I 
remember the villagers  
standing on t he stre ets a n d poi nti ng at  us and we
 had to prot ect ours elves by hidi ng behi nd the tanks  
that were rolling by
.   I  re me mb er  my  fat her  g oin g over  to  o n

in their tanks de spite the 
li mitati ons  and re gulati ons  not t o pi ck 
up civil ia ns.  They
 br ought us  from 
village to village and unti
l the, a certain destinati
on where they could not move
 on any longer.  They  
placed me in a far mer™s hom

 to light the fire in 
the oven, ma de room for

while, the battle 
wa s goi ng on a nd we ha d t o move  on. 
Q: This  far mer that you were
 with, wh at nationality was he?  
A: The ge ne ral popul ation ther e wa
s Ukraini an but he wa s such a 
si mp le ma n, a man wit h a p ure  
soul.  He did not know of any 
nationalities, he did not know of
 any differences
 between human 
beings .  He wa s j ust a poor 
s oul , alive  and tr ying t o li ve as pur e as  he c oul d. 
Q: Were you wi th your
 parents with him?  
A: Ye s.  Th at™s h o w we  survi ve
d, t h e three of us , in t hat one  st
able.  That isol
ated, totally God-
forsaken countr y, r eall y.  The object ive was to mo

 to our pl ace of ori gi n  
whi ch was Short koff (ph) .  It wa
s not easy to move on. 
 Everywhere we went
 there was cartouches 
(ph) a nd bombs a nd artil ler
y.  We  als o found our s e lves i n ca mps 
with soldiers arou

forbi dden for us to sta

kitchen in offering my services.  
I went to the cook telli
ng hi m I™ m gonna peel potat oes  in or der  for  
hi m t o give me s o me food for my par ents .  And he
 pointed a big knife  toward
s me  said, ﬁThis is not 
a toy for a little girl
 like you.ﬂ  And th
en he gave me a whole bucket
 of hot potatoes and I was  
proudl y c arr ying it  towa r ds my par e

Q: How old do you thi nk you were  now?  

A: Gosh, you™ve got me.  I really 
am totally at a loss.  I lost tr
ack of ti me  and age a n d I have , I  
totally cannot recall.  I coul

r-old maybe, doing all that. 
Q: I™ m imagining that it™s

A: Yes I agr ee and I™ ve been tryi ng to ponder upon 
that be caus e in no way coul d I have bee n suc h a  
young t ende r  age t o do all that .  And I suspe ct t her
e may be  a di fference 
of four or  fi ve years  
bet wee n my actual birt hdate 
and the, t he date that i s given i n my
 records.  This be
ing that, when we 
were aiming to emigrate 
to the United States, we needed t o ha
ve a s pons or.  And bei ng a c hild, I  
coul d not ge t a s ponsor  beca use  we had to gua ra ntee 
that we woul d not fall to welfare, that we  
would be abl e to support 
ours elves.  The per son that spons ore d us
, my pare nts, couldn™t , did not fin d  
any wor k for  me, s o t hat  I  ha d t o be  younger
 i n or der to quali fy to e nter  as  a  child. 
Q: So I don™ t wa nna br ea
k the flow of earlier but 
thank you and ca n you con
tinue telling me about 
your e xperie nces  s oon a ft er being li be rated but not  yet  being tr uly free?  
A: Thi s  ti me  wa s al so ti me
 of trial and tribulations. 
 The road to ret urn to our
 home  wa s not ea sy.  I t  
wa s invol ve d wi th narrow e sca pes of 
bombs whi c h were not at  least, no
t dir ectly direct ed against us.  
At least this was a general war, 
not a war wa ged a gainst thre e people .  Thr ee Je wis h, a gainst Je ws t o  
begi n wit h.  We finally 
came to our place of bi rth, 
not  of birt h but t hat™ s where we wer e livi ng and 
there was no sign of th

was  wi ped out t o the gr ound.  Ther e was , our home  
wa s t otall y none xiste nt .   The r e we re s o me bric ks
, broken gl ass  and not hing

ntly was occupied by pe
opl e that escaped in the 
last minute when the Russians ap
proached because the oven was 
still warm and there was a fire  
burning in the fireplace.  We es
tablished our living ther
e for a short while.  
The bombs were falling 
near by de str oyi ng t he  re st of the  buildings .  We  st
ayed on t rying t o make
 cont act wit h near by 
villagers a nd far mers t hat  we kne w be fore but nob
ody woul d l et us i n.  Nobod
y would speak to us . 
Everybody was hostile and surprised 
that we survived.  They even 
went far enough to
 tell us that 
they di dn™ t know who we  were , t o get out  
of the ir proper ty and j ust t o go a w ay.  
Q: Di d you e ncount er a ny ot he

A: No .  Wh en we ca me  bac k, we

people t hat l i ved i n t hat town befor e  the Nazi

Q: Was this, was this in th

A: It wa s i n Short koff  (ph) which wa s se ve

My fat her was deli rious,  
didn™t recognize me.   The bomb

the glass was shattered.  It was qu

emotions, my fe ar was with me a

ital bed being so a fr a id, cl osing 
my eyes and being ready for what

whatever wi ll come.  Soon enoug

We found a place to live 
and we we nt on.  We

Q: Where were you li ving now?  Th

A: It was stil l in Short koff ( ph) . 
 It wa s Short koff ( ph) but it wa s oc

it was still an area where th

We we re hoping to move

parti cular  direc tion but we c oul d not sta y i n t he

Q: Were you experiencing anti-Se mitism?  

A: There was anti- Semi ti sm i n t he 
Polish population, foreve
r.  Before t he war,
 during the war and 
after the war.  So much so that when we moved to
 the west , again we came 
to a beautiful city which 
was called Vrotsluv (ph) and agai
n my parents started 
a little business.  Agai
n, selling goods and  
selling clothing and 
we had a very beautifu l home .  This was 
a home that belonged
 to Nazis, former 
Nazis.  These Nazi s escaped and le

re allowe d to move i n.  As a matt er of 
fa ct we wer e  assi gne d by an orga nizat ion t o, t o mo ve

this was like a, a mall 
and dur ing the day when I wa

I was not liked.  The 
Poli sh st udents did not sociali ze with

was religion we had 
to wait outside.  We  c
ould not participate in certa
in club activ

was certain remarks, t here were 
remarks ma de behind our backs. 
 There was not a very friendl y 
at mos phe re i n sc hool.  Despite  that, I conti nued to 
really thrive and love sc

Q: Had Germany been 
defeated already? 
A: Yes.   Thi s  was  the  ti me  whe n Ge r ma ny  was  i n 
ruins  and de feat ed.  And 
this was the time where 
there was movement to get 
the Jews  out of Poland.  
Actually, we had 
to get  ours elves 
out of Poland.  
However the r e were or ga nizati ons tha t  wer e hel p

We  bri e fly parke d quot e unquote i n

and we visite d, I re me mber 
Bodgoshtine (ph) which was a, a summer home fo
r Hitler.  And it is a 
very beautiful place, 
unfortunately, Hitler made 
it his residence and that 
brought back bad me mories
 and bad taste in our 
mout h.  But ,  besides that, the li fe 
was pleasant .  We did not stay at 
one pla c e for long
.  We ke pt on 
movi ng on a nd moving on. 
Q: Di d you f i nally fe el fr ee 
wh en you came  
to Austria? 
A: I , yes, a nd I woul d think we
 fel t  fr ee because we wer e  toge
ther in a community, not in a 
communit y per se , but i n  a commune wit h all Je wi sh pe opl e.  They had the ai m, to i m mi grate a nd to  

bec o me a us eful, pr oduct i ve citi zen
 of a countr y that we were prou
d of.  There was , be t wee n us, we 
had no di scr i mi nati on and we, it did not ha ve mu ch
 interaction with the Au
stria n population ot her  
than being like a tourist. 
 So we di d feel free altho
ugh it wa s not a nor ma
l life  that we were leading.  
It wa s not t h at we woke up i n the 
morning, ha d to go t o wor k
 and, and have a stab
le environment.  It 
wa s a gai n, a te mpor ary e xiste nce  
but it was a pleasant on
e wit hout e xec uti on and wit hout prejudic e. 
Q: Di d you go t o t he DP c a mp i n Sal z
burg or  wher e  di d you st ay ther e?  
A: It wa s no t a ca mp a n
d it was not called the Displaced Persons
 Ca mp .  It wa s an
 a s signed, als o  
like, it wasn™t barracks, but there,
 it was an assigned ar ea that  we had lived like i n a commune.  It  
was together  with other peopl e and we shar ed co
mmon bathrooms and bedr

joys  of t ouri s m and so on. 

Q: Had your  fa mi ly be en practi cin
g t h e reli gious  c ustoms  t hroughout?  

A: We pract iced mainl y  the holid
a y s, al though we  ha d not  run acr os
s real religious within that 
commune.  So me of them were no

A: Oka y fr om Salz bur g, some how we were a ssi gned t o a city called Awns boh (ph) whic h i s 
sout her n Ger ma ny.  And there  it wa s l i ke a di spl a
c ed c a mp whi ch you have a
lluded to although we  
did not see i t  as a camp.  There 
were indi vidual hous es wi thi n  cer
tain area, there were no walls to 
the area except it was outside of 
the city with an area of wood
s a nd fl ower be ds a nd it was ver y  
pleasant.  There, there was a Je
wish self-ruling committe
e established where al
l the administrative 
work was done by a, by an elected quote unquot
e governme nt body.  And my fathe r  happe ned to  
become one and we was kind of considered to be 
the elite group of that 
commune.  My uncle who 
returned from the Russ ian Ar my, he was the only 
one that  sur vived due to
 t he fact  that he was 
threat en t o t he Russian Ar
my , wa s the physician for that wh ole ar
ea.  And again we 
wer e  fe d wel l . 
We  had a ample supply of food.  
M y, my own c onc ern was t o go on wit h  my e ducati on and I did  
not like li ving in that commune so because of th
e school bei ng in the dow
nt own ar ea, my parents  
and I deci de d that I would move
 out and live with a fa mily, ir
onic enough, a Ger ma n fa mil y. 
Ho wever, I had my  own r
oom and I could go to school in th
e mor ning t hen I woul d ha ve tut ors 
come in the afternoon to their ho
use where I coul d tot ally concentr
a t e on my st udie s a nd, and I™ d 
have tutors either going to their 
home s or the y comi ng to my home . 
 These tutor s were for mer Nazi  
profe ss ors , they wer e not  allowed p
ublicly to teach anymor
e in the sc hool syste m so t he y ma de t heir  
living by t ut oring st udents
.  And tha t ™s, I  fell  in
t o the hands agai n of fo
r mer Nazi s.  Si nce my 
objective was to get as much as I 
can as far  as educatio
n was  c onc erne d, to catc h up for  the t i mes  
that I l ost , I deci ded to forgo t h
e fact t hat these were Nazis and 
conti nued on without dwelli ng upon 
political differences
.  I also in the afternoon, a
ttended a special course for quot e 
Cre eks bes ha ydic kter (ph)  whic h mea n s, mea nt that  all 
the people that participat
ed in the war, in the 
Ger ma n Ar my coul d not attend re gu
lar sc hool a n d the se wer e  for mer
 Nazi  yooogunt 
(ph) and Na zi  
soldi ers t hat vol unte ere d early i n li fe t o be in t h
e ar my.  A special course 
was creat ed for them at a 
very fa st pa ce to catc h up on all the educ ation 
requi re me nts .  And we 
found out about it and I 
appli ed for t hat and I got  accepted so I was the only
 femal e st udent, 
Jewi sh, sitti ng wit h all for mer  
Naz i s, Nazi soldi ers , Hitl er yoogunt ( ph) t hat dur
i ng brea ks made t he sa me re mar ks t h at I used to  
hear before that how sorry they are that they didn™t
 kill off all the Jews and that they had to do it

over again, they would volunteer 
over again and they ha
d no hesitation admitti
ng how, how 
they are 
looking for w ard t o t he  Na zis c o mi ng
 back and r ega in
ing t he power .  
Q: Di d the y know you were J e wis h at  the  ti me?  
A: I wo ul d,  wa ger  that  t hey  k n
ew except t hat it never came up an
d we  never  dis cuss ed it .  The y  
de fini tely knew t hat I wa s not , by birt h, a Ger man.  
I don™t thi n k that my se nt
iments were 
suc h that I  
could join them in the di
scussions of the past activities and they
 must have suspect
ed but they were  
uni nhi bite d a nd not re mor se ful  at  all of wh
at  they di d a nd wha t
 wa s ri ght  to do. 
Q: Di d you f i nd it ver y tr oublin
g to be around such
 students and even 
the other teachers? 
A: It  was di ffic ult , it wa s  ver y di
fficult and sad for me t o 
just totally, fi rst of al
l , I was isolat ed.  I  
coul d not ha ve muc h int e raction, 
you i magine in a classr oom where,
 what if you mi ss c ertain note s  
and what if you nee d to ask so meth
i ng, s o it wa s  very di ffi cul t.  It was troubli ng but I had only one  
choi ce: eithe r , eit her gi ve  up and 
not  do what I  se t out  to do or just
 to suffer through it and obtain 
wh at my goal was.  Some  of the 
tea chers were frie ndl y, they li ked 
me and t hey wer e  admiri ng me a s  
a chil d or young per son stic king to
 my guns despite the 
fact that it was so di
fficult.  And they 
underst ood t he sit uati on and some ti me
s they even favored me.  Some 
of t h e teacher s were di rectl y 

hostile and maybe I pe
rceived it as being hostile 
but they™re definitely not
 friendly.  The people I  
lived with were fairly civilized. 
 I had kitche n privileges a nd they made s ur e there was enough coal  
because the winter was cold th
ere and it was fairly livable.  
Q: How ofte n would you see your par ents?  

A: I would go visit maybe every 
third day, and go, it was on a h
illside and was go up 
there and visit 
for an hour or t wo a nd t hen go ba
ck, understanding that hey, we™re 
not se parate d beca use of ne ed. 
We  were se parate d beca use of c hoic e and tha t  I 
had t o ac complis h thi s and not t otal l y live  in a  
displ ace d ca mp where  I c oul d not  ac
hi eve  that  e duc ation as  I  di d. 
Q: Had your  fa mi ly alre a dy st
art ed some  ki nd of paper w ork to e mi grat e t o t he U.S.?  
A: I think they di d bec ause by the 
sheer fact that they were assign
ed to that area that this came  
through an organi zati on t hat assigned us to that area
 in order, then later to 
emigrate according to the  
planne d number of people 
that wer e gonna leave that area.  Th

Q: What year? 
A: What year? 

Q: What, what year do you
 think this was that y
ou were in Awnsboh (ph)? 
A: ™46, se ve n. 

Q: So it may 
have still been
 Palestine. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So I™m also curious, in preparation to go to 
the Unite d St at es, si nce you did have it i n your mi nd 

that you wer e tryi ng t o e mi grate  ther e,
 did you st art le arni ng Englis h at  all ? 

A: Yes I did and as a matter of fact I was introduc
ed to the English la ngua ge through newspa pers . 
And thi s ha d starte d the se, in Vr
otsl uv (ph) be fore we ca me to Au
stria a nd Ger ma ny.  My fathe r  
wa s a se l f-ta ught man and he belie ve
d ver y muc h in s t arti ng early so
 he  use d to r ea d to me , he  
taught hi mse l f Engli sh t h rough cer
tain, certain self, self, like tape
s  and books  and t he y  we re c alle d 
Longons hi de  (ph) lett ers  and th
rough those  books he t aught  hi
ms elf to prono
unce t he English 
voc abulary a nd l ear n t he, the  language.  So he i n
tr oduce d me  t o thos e books a nd t o ne wspa pers  an d 
that™s became my, t hus I  l ear
ne d t he  la nguage of Englis h. 
Q: Do you re me mber  s o me 
of the first things that 
you lear ned i n  Engli sh?  
A: Ye ah , I r e me mbe r  so me articl e
, s o me arti cle i n the  ne wspaper a nd it s aid, Engla nd won a ne w  

lease of l i fe  and I c oul dn™t ki nd of t r ansl ate it into Ger man ‚ caus e ther e™ s no e qui val ent ki nd of  

expr essi on, a ne w leas e of li fe .  
And I remember sayi ng 
to my father, I said, 
ﬁJust like we won a  
new lease of life now.ﬂ  That
 was a lot of fun to lear
n all that and explore and.

Q: What la ngua ge  was  your  fat her
 us ing to explai n Englis h t o you. 
A: Some, mostly German.  But he 
was, my fathe r  wa s also a Yiddis
hci st ( ph) .  He bel i eve d in t he 
Yiddis h l anguage a nd t he  Yi ddi sh cult ure a nd he  used
 to speak to me in Yi
ddish too which sounds 
like German and so it was 
eas y for me t o understa nd.  He  en
couraged me so much to use the 
Yiddish source of literature which 
was very rich and to read like  __________ and 
Sholomosh (ph) 
and Byal ake (ph) , Nokman Byalake ( p h) i n
 He bre w and Yi ddi sh tr anslati o ns.   
Q: How l ong di d you st ay 
or  about  how l ong in Aw
nsboh (ph) and then wher
e did you go after that? 
A: I think we stayed in
 Awnsboh (ph) a ppr oxi mately se ven or 
eight months.  From there I think I 
we nt t o a ve ry bri e f st ay at Muni
ch because I qualifi ed fo
r ent rance to t he Uni v
er sity of Munich by  
compl eting t hat special course wh
ic h was a very advanc ed c o urse .  I did go to M uni c h for a bri e f 
period of time and fr om there we 
qualified to emigrate 
t o the Uni t ed States. 
 We di d le ave M unic h 
to Bra me rhoffe n (ph) whi ch i s t he port  from wh
ere the Jews embarked to
war ds t he  Unite d State s.  
Q: When you wer e i n M unic h, 
di d you st ay on your own ther
e ?  Wer e your pare nts  with you?  
A: No, my  parents rema ined in Aw
ns boh ( ph)  and I st aye d aga i n, 
I wa s a ss i gne d a r oom in a l arg e  
Naz i  home a nd again, the y had a lar ge  Jewi sh co mmunit y in M unic h and there wa s a sel f- gover ning 
body again, a Jewish sel f- gover ni
ng body with, they™ ve for m er, a 
ver y fa mous for mer  prominent  
Je ws bei ng a t  the  top.  
An d th ey  mad e  sure
 that the Jewish, 
remaining Jewish po
pul ation had a plac e  
to live by, by plac ing the m i n ho
mes where for mer Nazis 
lived and restrict ed 
der Libens traum (ph)  
just li ke t he y restri cte d ours for a long period of ti
me.  It wa s not  ver y pl easa nt to l i ve wit h t hese 

people beca use you we r e re minded ever y da y t hat 
what , that they were sorry t hat t hey did not  
complete the job of total liquidati
ng t he Jewi sh r a ce and that t hey™ d 
have to do it over again, they 
would.  So t hey ne ver le ft that  doubt i ng t hat  the y
 are sorr y t h at it did not  
come t o be, what t hey 
planne d to do.  Ot her wis e, li fe  wa
s very bea uti ful  in M uni ch.  Again,
 I e nj oye d my st udent ye ars.  I  
love d the universit y and 
the environment there.  I loved the cu
ltural life there, 
the museums we re  
fa bul ous.  The musi cal li fe , I re me
mber, for the first time
 when Leonard Bernst
ei n came to conduct  
a s y mphony and I we nt t her
e  and he  pers ona lly, I  got t o s ha ke  ha nd
s wit h hi m.  it  
was such a thrill 
for me .  And again, attend
ing all  these theater s an
d art  museums.  The  stud
ent population at Munich 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448

Uni ver sity had a fai r ly, few Je wis h st ude nts a nd we 
r e mained very clos e.  
Unfort una te ly, t he, t he ,  
the st udent  body at Europ
ean universities is not a ve
ry cl os e-kni t , it™s  not tha t  you att end a clas s a nd 
you™re part of that cl ass.  You 
atte nd certai n c our ses on di ffer ent 
le vel s.  So we di d not have on e  
unit , there was one fri end at t his 
l evel, a not her friend on the other  
level but we kept very friendly 
and we had a Jewish student 
organization.  It wa s nice. 
Q: Wh at was the trip li
ke to t he United St ates? 
A: I reme mber it was a tr
ans port  s hip.  Ever ybody 
wa s si ck.  It wa s quite  pa cke d.  The  j our ney was  
not ver y ea sy, the voyage t hrough the s ea wa s 
quite st or my but I s h all ne ver forget, I don™t  
remember t h e year 
but  I  know t he  day when 
we arrived.  We coul dn™t  
e at much exc ept t he  da y 
when we arr i ved, we doc ked at a port  and we st
ood the re for a whole da y 
and suddenl y we were  
serve d big portions of turkey.  
I knew what it was but 
a l ot of pe ople di dn™t 
know a nd s aid what ™s  
happe ning, s uddenl y, all  that big 
food and t urned out to
 be  Thanksgi vings Da
y a nd that ™s why we  
staye d a  whole day doc ked at t h
e Ne w York  Har bor  lo ok
ing at these skyri ses and the Stat ue of 
Libe rty and r eally gi ving t hanks  fo
r  arr i ving at  t he 
land of freedom. 
Q: Wh at were your first impression
s wh en you fi nally 
got off the ship? 
A: We had no conce pt what it woul d 
be like to, to arrive in a, in 
a country that we  didn™t know 
anybody.  Where will , we  had no pl
a n, we were j us t  goi ng t here  wit h
out a ny plans what  would be or  
how it woul d ha ppen.  
We  arri ved, we docke d for a whole  day, 
we were take n off the  shi p.   The y  
were calling out names and 
I rememb er hearing our 
name, Hertzog ( ph), and I couldn™t imagine, say 
who knows us here , I mean w
ho would be c alli ng our na me?  An
d these were people from an 
orga niza tion, I thi nk  it  was Hebre w Aid Socie ty, 
Hi yos s ( ph) .  And we we re taken t o a place  wher e 
registr ations and a ll ki nds  of pa per w
or k ha d to be done .  The n we we re as signed t o sta y i n a hotel i n  
Manhatta n a nd we were t o come 
to that administrative building 
whic h was s o me wh
ere ar ound east,  
on the  ea st side  and we  were ha
d t o wal k fr om Ma nhatt an to c o
me  for  lunc h and 
di nner  to that 
administrative building.  This wa
s at the transitio
nal period.  From there 
we had to d
ecide, people 
had to decide what to do and how to
 construct their lives.  For lots 
of people, this 
was just a waiting 
period to move on to differen
t s t ate s, midwe st and Chi cago and s o on.  Being tha t  people had

relatives in those parts of the Unit
ed States.  We  were destined to 
st ay i n New York si nce my fat her 
had a cousin.  It was a time of sear
ch, a time of inst
ability, a time of insecurit
y, a time of losing self-
respe ct for onesel f, bei ng that we wer e de pe nde nt
 on t his  Hebr ew Ai d Soci
ety to provide us with 
lodging a nd food.  We  had onl y a  
limited amount of reso
urc es t o e stabli s h our own i dentit y.  The 
sponsor that signed for us was 
a cousin of my father™s who wa
s a millionaire in 
New York, being 
the proprietor of a multi-m
illion dollar business consisti
ng of all, of all the th

that he i mported fr om Chi na that wer e folded 
and ba gge d in his plant  in Ne w York Cit y.  We  
natur a lly vis ited hi m a nd other me mb

You were t e lling me about meeti ng

A: Ah, my father re plie d, ﬁI™ll do wha t  I always do

how ar e you gonna start?  You don™
t have any money.  
I™ m gonna give you a 
job because I signed  
for t hat.ﬂ  So he offere
d a  job for  my mother  a nd for mysel f . 
 Now legally I was 
not  suppose d to be  
working yet.  He placed us in
 a sweatshop where it 
was packed with wome

large l ong ta ble fol di ng t hos e net s, hairnet s and pl

 The wor k wa s so fast

with a real  whip and hit the tabl

 withdra w  our  ha nds because we wer e not fas t

 that kind of envi

kept on walking the str eet s of 5

And a fte r a whi l e, I wa s desi gni ng c h ildren™s wear  at

 I used to fini s h a job and s a y we

An other piece of cloth.  I, my, I,

So I was awarded their , t heir, I wa

not reall y knowing wha t , how the y gonna s urvi ve

 the major storekeeper  
as my fat her  was mai nly ordering

back into business.  I then, it was 
time that I get out of this fa mi

lost all their property and ho me 
and textile plant in Eu
rope thought that ma

bac k.  A move me nt wa s on for _
_________, meant t hat t he  Ger m
a n governme nt shoul d rest ore  
some of t he propert y to t he Jews.  I, t here not bein
g ver y ha ppy in that e nvir onme nt of st ore and just  
doi ng desi gning, I de cide d to go back
 to Europe and to enroll in the 
universit y ther e and at the same  
ti me try t o s ee i f I c oul d regai n s o me of our, our

 a g ain, di d not

I did ma ke some contact s wit h

discouraged me saying that there

  By then my fa ther had had 
some account in a Swiss ba

mysel f t o Ba irn (ph), Swi t zerla nd a nd 
enroll at the university
, conti nue my  medi cal studies there an

agai n, was t o no avail.  
I we nt to the ba nk a nd t hey said the r e™s no s uc h  
account .  But I stayed on at the Un

wit h honor s.  Switz erland wa s nice 
in the effe ct that I had all the 
free dom to study and there was a  
small Jewish student population ther

my  ai m a nd that™s w a s my 
goal a nd t hat™s why I we nt

the meantime, a very sad 
thing ha ppe ned, whil e I wa

became ill

very di ffic ul t since be ing in me dicine , I kne w what
 the out come would be.  However , I had to go

and my mot her pa sse d a wa y without  me being at  he r be dsi de.  My fathe r  upon c ons ult ation wit h a  
rabbi decided not to let me know un
til it was too late fo r me to come 
‚cause they were afraid that I 
would stop s chool a nd ne ver ret ur n 
to it.  And being in the last ye
ar t he y t hought 
it would be wis e  
for me to fi nish and that I defi ni
tely could not change th e situation.  This is 
still a very heavy guilt 
that is weighing upon my shoul der s, not being abl e
 to hol d the  hand at the end of her li fe a nd I™ll  
just ha ve to l ive wit h i t. 

Q: Did you t alk with your pare
nts once you were in 
the U.S. much about 
your experie nces duri ng  
the Holocaust? 

A: I ne ver did spe ak about it, neither wa s my mo
ther .  M y father bei ng the e xtr overt ki nd of a  
pers on starte d to wri t e a dra ma , dr a m a and he na me d 
it , ﬁ Oh Hea r  Me World.ﬂ   He never fini she d it . 

It was tr ansl ated by a fr iend i nto
 English.  He wrote it in Yiddis
h.  He liked to talk about his 
experiences  but  we ne ver  di d. 

Q: When di d you per sona lly
 deci de to spea k public ly
 about your experiences? 
A: In 1995.  I had joined
 a cert ain or ganizati on t hr ough the  Je wi
sh community, Jewish
 Federation in 
L.A.  The y had s o me progra ms , c ultural pr ogra ms  a
nd I ca me upon c ertai n people .  The y were c hil d 
survi vors in di ffere nt c oun
tries , in Sc a ndi navi an c o untrie s a nd t h
ey were telling of their experiences 
as or pha ns being t ake n t o a pri est , by prie sts i nt
o, J esui t s a n d churc hes a nd li ved i n orphanage s. 
And they ha d the most
 interesting stories to tell 
a n d fi nall y I joined t he m.  Alt hough I did not spe ak 

much on my  experience
, I ha d t his  fee ling that  I be
longed to a  c ertain gr oup, that  is  chi ld survi vors .  
In 1995, my  son being a 
student at  t he Universit y
 of Penns yl vani a, visi te d Wa shi ngt on a nd vis ited 
the museum, the Holocaust Muse
um and came back 
and ha d as ke d me to tal k  about my  
experiences .  Although I never di d sp
eak to my children about it, I di
d spea k to hi gh school st udent s  
at the Je wi s h Fe derati on and I 
became a docent  at the 
Museum of the Holoca
ust i n L.A., in Los  
An gel e s.  

Q: What s ort  of long-t er m  
i mpa ct do you feel  the Holo
c aust  has  had on your life?  
A: I n t he  pa st I did not t hink t hat
 it had any impact.  I just was so
 involved with su
cceeding i n li f e  
and, and pursuing what I wa
nted t o do in my li fe and, and medi
cine was my only go
al in life.  And

then I got married and I had two 
beautiful successful children and 
I think I instilled
 upon them the 
same love of learning and that there was my all,
 my whole awareness was t he presence, the present ,  
not thinking of the past.  Now that I start dwelli
ng on the past and s eeing 
t hat, I had no childhood , 
that I  ha d li ved t his li fe i n  hidi ng and during pe
rse c utions and a very unus ua
l  chil dhood, I , I begi n t o 
realize t hat i t , I think it made me a stronger 
pers on alt hough I cannot i ma gine how it would have  
bee n had I had a nor ma l childhood. 

Q: Have you started to wr ite ab
out your experi ences as well?  
A: I have .  I  ha d bee n e ncoura ged by ce rtain pe
ople  in the newspa per  fie l
d t o, a fter  t hey sa w my  
story in a vi deot ape , t o write  down thos e e xpe ri
ence s a nd I  deci de d to do t hat .  And it™s  slow 
because I™m still very much
 involved in medicine 
and it just leading a no
rmal, busy professional 
life.  But one of these days, I™ll 
r etreat and do some more recoll ectio
ns, putti ng it down on pa pers  s o  
that maybe my children and 
their children can read 
about it.  As of today, 
my daughter still doesn™t 
know what her mot her  went t hrough a nd what  
a  li fe s he has  ha d duri
ng he r childhood.   
Q: Would you mi nd rea di ng just  
for a mo ment or two, a selecti
on from,  some  of your me mo irs?  
A: This is entitled, ﬁA Day 
in the Life  of a Hidden 
Child.ﬂ  It was a day as 
it was in t
hose times, a 
dark stable, a hor se, a hi gh st ack of 
hay.  Thi s, t hi s ha y oc cupi ed a s pac e al most up to t h e roof.  Two 

little girls, motionless, lying side
 by side, communicating only with a 
whisper, a sigh.  Sharing the  
sa me de stiny for no re ason or fault 
of their own.  Each di fferent, ea
ch from di fferent
 corner s of the 
world, thrown into a doom
ed fate of struggle an
d despair.  Both cuddling an i magi nar y dream on  
their worn- o ut bl anket, t he c olor  of hay t o bl end i n
 with.  The space was smal
l , onl y r oom to sit but  
not to stand.  Th e positi
on as sume d was horiz onta l , layi ng down 
only, to re duc e fricti on, to conser ve 
ener gy, ti me  of the  day j udged by t he  sounds  of th
e outsi de.  Sunrise by th
e crowing of 
the rooster, 
sundown by the return of
 the vill agers fr om the fiel ds.  Sund
ays and holi days by t he presence of the 
horse in the stable, by the small rati
on of milk instead
 of water.  At the crac
k of the da wn, the far mer  
would e nter the bar n, get ting the  
hors e rea dy for  a da y™s  wor k.  He
 woul d ca rry a pa il of water ,  
some of whi ch we woul d share w
ith the horse and a piece of dry br
ead under hi s shirt.  With a  
cough, he woul d signal his appr oa ch, produc e a la dde
r a nd pla ce it at the e dge of t he ha y.  He woul d

place then, t he wat er and the bread

quic k as pos sible .  This e xchange 
was so fast, wa s so quic k tha t  we
 never had the chance to see his 
face.  Ti me wa

Q: And before we  concl
ude, will you just 
let me  know after you were
 in school in Switzerland, 
when di d you ret ur n t o 
the U.S. and where you lived after that, briefl y?  
A: Aft er I gr aduated, a s I  menti one d, I went t o I sr

ed a tourist for two weeks 
and the n I j o ined, I vol unteered at 
t hei r hospit al in 
Tella  Sha mir  (ph)  and Ra ma dgan ( ph)  in Isr ael .  I  
was almost persuaded 
to remain there and work 
there in the hospital howe
ver, I still felt that the 
Uni t ed Stat es were my home and I 
returned 1966.  I ret urned to 
Ne w York.  I ha d t o pa ss cert ai n
