house for mo st of the hours that usually 
people in Œ who are 
work ing were, usually 
from about eight o™clock until four o™clock at
 Œ in the afternoon. And then he had 
sometimes meetings with Œ at his place 
at the quarters where his army post was. 
And sometimes soci Œ social 
events, sometimes in the parades. I think he had Œ at 
one point was the adjutant of the 
general who was chief officer of 
Lvov
. So as an 
adjutant he would stand at the place wh
ere the parade was being received by the 
president of the city. And

Q: What was his rank? 
A: He was a captain. 

Q: He was a captain. And was there an 
army base, a military base then, in 
Lvov
? 
A: Oh, but several. Italians, 
or several, how you call it, th
e Œ the bi Œ it™s a big Œ was 
a very big city, so it had a lot of different kinds of 
[indecipherable]
 my father was

the marching people, the soldiers, foot 

soldiers.

the air force. They 
had the small Œ there

career, he was in charge of security of be

this Polish air for Œ at 
Lvov
 Œ 
Q: The airport. 
A: Œ air force Œ air Œ airport. 
Q: Wa Œ it sounds like it was very much th
en a military town. 
Were all Polish cities 
had so many bases from the military, or was 
Lvov
 exceptional in some way? 
A: No, 
Lvov 
was a third size city in 
Poland
. It was a very well known, years, years 
before, centuries before, as 
a commercial crossroad from the 
Baltic 
to 
Black Sea
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so there was a lot of influx of th
e Armenians, and th e people from the east 
who were trading, going th rough. And th
en  later on it developed quite a well-known 
cultural center. And it was Œ it ha
d this specific atmosphere. 
Lvov 
was somehow 
unique in  that sense that if you meet anywhere somebody from 
Lvov
, you always 
have something to talk about and you 
ask each other, where did you live, what 
street? And was a very patriotic city, but 
toward the end of the first World War, 
after the Austrian empire fe
ll through Œ lost the war, 
Galicia
, that was part of the 
Austrian empire was again, somehow, 
having problems with
 the minorities, and 
there was a big minority of the 
Ukrainians, wanted to have 
Lv ov  
as their city, and 
there were strong battle in Œ for several m

Russia

the battle for Œ they 
entered also the eas

Poland

they wanted  to bring co mmunism to

young people who were fighting for the in
dependence were already at the front, 
being busy, so the students of 
Lvov
, the students of universities Œ there were a 
couple of polytechnic and university very
 well recognized. And th e young ch ildren,

Q: Of 
Poland

A: Œ it became part of Polish, because

 I can™t re-recall how many 
miles yet to the Russian border, because 
it, y ou know, was se

miles to the Russian border, so
 it was still well in Œ well in

Q: Yeah. Tell me  a little bit about your mo ther. Her name again was?

Q:

. And how Œ what was her role? Was sh

Q: Okay .

A: Or also she worked in bank. And then
 when she got married
, one of the things 
that life of the officer was very often 
on th e move. You spend few years here, few 
years there, and then we were born, so she r
eally took care of us for rest of her life. 
Q: Was Œ was your family from 
Lvov 
for generations, or had your parents moved 
there from other parts of 
Poland
? 
A: On my  mo ther™s side and my  husband Œ 
my father™s side, there were memb ers of 
Lvov 
community. I don™t know ex
actly, looking past a hund
red years Œ mo re than 
hundred years of my father™s families Œ pr
ogeny, and the relativ
es who were, but I 
know that they were qu
ite well-known in the 19
th
 centu ry. And on 
my  mo th er™s 
side, they were well-recognized as book 
editors and bookselle
rs. That was on my 
mother™s side, and also  when the 
oil started at the lower part of 
Poland
, close to 
Ukrainian border, some of the Œ the memb er
s of my mother™s family were owners 
of the Œ of the Œ 
Q: Oil wells? 
A: Œ oil wells, or participated
 in some kind of things. 
Q: In the oil business probably. Ho w woul
d you describe your
 chi Œ the home life 
inside your home? Were your parents very 
strict, were they lenient? What were 
some of their values? What are the thi
ngs you remember them, I guess sh-sharing 
with you that were imp o rtant to them?

A: I think that I™m Œ I gain
ed much from Œ from them, fr
om the teaching, or wi Œ 
they were very moral people. 
Q: Were they religious? 
A: They were religious and they attende
d th e church  as we Œ although, when  I 
started going to the Œ the primary school, 
it was a public school, but they were also 
Œ sometime the Œ the schools 
run by nuns, or the Œ for th
e girls, or for boys, the 
monks. Bu t I was in public school, but we
 had also gone th
rough a Œ learning 
religion in school, and attende
d all Œ part of our life was living also a religious life. 
And all our mo rals are based on that, and 
I think th at Œ that added to the strength 
afterwards, that we, when difficulties starte
d later in life, and the tragedy started, 

that the Œ the base was that we had loving
 parents, and my  mo ther would Œ although 
I always felt that she preferred my brothers to me, she was very st
rict Œ stricter with 
me. It™s only when I was grown-up, much 
grown-up, she Œ she told me that she 
expected more from me, and was stricter 
with me because the women have hard er 
life, and have mu ch mo re to depend on th
e moral self- awareness 
than the boys. So 
there Œ therefore, difference that I felt as a 
negative thing, was in the form of trying 
to make me  stronger. 

Q: Do you think it worked? 
A: I think so .

Q: Yeah. Which Œ wh ich pare
nt were you closer to? 
A: I was close to my mother because sh
e was always around. But I was also Œ I 
knew that I was in Œ in ma Œ in the eyes 
of my  father a little princess. I would Œ 
wouldn™t do anything Œ even  he expected al
so a lot of me. Fort
unately I was a good 
student, so there was never this Œ any c
onflicts like that. But 
I remember once she 
wa Œ he was passing by my  
Œ our bedroom, and a rug th
at was near my  bed was 
crooked. And I remember him telling me, yo
u, with your artistic in clination, how 
can you stand a crooked rug? And tha Œ you
 know, that mu st have been so many 
years ago, but something like th is happened
. And I was very pro
ud of my  father, he 
had been Œ ha-had  many frie
nds, and was considered quite an Œ outstanding as a 
person. 
Q: Was he an outgoing person? 

A: I would say he was mo re like home pe
rson, whenev er he was coming. He was 
not too much into going out so mu ch, but
 usually wh en he would come home, I 
would rememb er him readi
ng newspapers, and staying 
home, and Œ and also going 
visiting with the re Œ other relatives. But he
 was also very much feeling responsible 
for his subordinates. So he was always 
on th e lookout, or check
ing out with them. 
So I understand they  had a great admiration for him, which proved later on in life, 

when they were 
looking fo r him.

Q: Would you descri

you describe your ch ildhood? 
How would you, wh en you think back on th
ose years before the war, what is the 
feeling that you have? 
A: I would say, on Œ like mo st
 other girls, I would say si
milar experiences in school. 
I was sometimes teach er™s pe
t, so I suffered a little bit 
sometimes, b ecause being 
somehow shown as a Œ an example, make
s you an  enemy of some people. Bu t 
anyway, mostly a good, plea sant type of fa-family,
 
my  mo th er an d fa
ther, and also 
the distant family, aunts and uncles vis
iting, everybody will Œ 
even later on they, 
when as an adult, and some 
aunt, or some uncle from Œ from 
Poland
, when we 
visited, they remembered me as a child. 
And I remembered how 
close they were to 
our family. So it was a, I 
would say, mo re Œ mo stly 
[indecipherable]
 except that we 
were not rich, because the army people ar
e not rich, so I knew that from time to 
time they might have had some problems, 
financial problems if something extra 
happened. But I, fortunately,
 I don™t rememb er any big sickness in my  childhood or 

my brothers™, except for scarlet fever and di
phtheria. But at that
 time there was a 
kind of Œ every Œ every child almo st, had 
it, and you had to be in  the hospital, 
because there was epidemic of scarlet feve
r, so that they woul
d not allow children 
to stay home. So I spent so
me six weeks or something 
like that in the Œ in the 
hospital, but Œ my  brothers, too, at di
fferent times. But nothing really tragic.

Q: How would you describe
 your parents™ relations

A: It was Œ from what I can say, and co

them. It was great resp ect for my fath

husband™s respect. Th Œ I coul

am sure that it™s impossible to liv
e through life without any Œ any little 
disagreements or something, but I was not
 aware of any problem of any serious 
consequences. 
Q: Did you have close friends at school? 
A: Yes, I had several friends and Œ and 
Œ an d one, especially one whose parents 
were also friends of my parents. He was a famous painter in Œ in 
Poland
, and her 
mo ther was not wo rk ing, was also taking care. But 
Ba rah

A: Œ people, you know, kind of 
difficult, and because the army  Œ 
Poland
 was then, 
you know, just rising from th
e ashes. And I think in 
Poland
 was starting to build  the 
economy and industry. So it Œ a regular situ
ation with the army, it™s Œ wasn™t that 
they were not very 
[indecipherable]
. Maybe there were people who had so me 
special assignments, or some
thing like that, would get extra money fo r trouble, or 
something, a presentation or someth
ing. It™s not that we™re poor. 
Q: No. 
A: I didn™t feel the poverty. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But no Œ from knowledge of how the 
situation was. As an adult I could 
recognize that we™re middle class, well 
educated, and middle class very mu ch 
interested in the social and cultural life.
 But not probably exte
nsively or too often 
outside of 
Poland
. 
Q: Did your fami ly own a car? 
A: No, we did not own 
a car. The horses, the 
[indecipherable]

horses were usually belonged 
to Œ to the commander of th

we were not the people who could cause th

not to kind of being afraid that we ar
e facing such a mighty enemy, and su ch a 
ruthless enemy. So unfortunately, this
 happened. But it still, from what I 
understand, the Germans, when talking ab
out the September war, 1939 war, in their 
reports said that some of the bravery was 
enviable, about Poles be
fore they died, or 
before they had to leave the post, or so

I™d like to know personally, 
for you, for your family, wh
ere were you, and how did 
you learn of the war? 
A: Well, the instant of the war, I very 
well remember, th e first of September. I Œ 
when I came back from my aunt, near 
Kraków
, where I spend th e vacation, she 
brought me around sixth or fifth of August.
 And I knew that the Œ at that time th ere 
were some unpleasant meetings betw
een the German and Ru ssian people, 

diplomatic, some conferences 
or whatever, we didn™t know yet at that time. A nd 
because that war seemed to be imminent, my aunt and uncle brought me home to 

Lvov
. And by th en my father was not sleepi
ng at home, but staying on his post 
where he was assigned at part of 
Lvov
, at 
Lychakiv
, near where his whole unit was 
at. An d  my  mo th er to ok  me 
on the first of September to
 say hello to my father, 
because this was around Œ lik
e around 10 o™clock or so 
in the morning, to greet 
Tadeusz
 after coming back from vacation, and 
to  say hello, to see him, but then 
return without him, with my
 mother. And I was returning by tram number one. That 
I reme mb er too, the tram number one was 
actually traveling from nearby wh ere my  
father was staying, but he™s quite a lot 
across from where we 
lived, and by the time 
we were passing mid-after Œ sittin g in the Œ 
in the train and train was going, and we 
started hearing something like bomb s, or so
me shot Œ shooting, or something th at 
sounded like thunder, or we 
didn™t know what it was. And close to our church,

which is Œ which was not too far from the place where we lived, at that number one 
stopped, and the tramway Œ an
d people were trying to wa
tch the planes flying over, 
and people were saying no, th-these are not
 Polish, these are not Polish planes. And 
then we hear some of the bombs breaking
 sound, and the Œ the conducto r of the 
tramway said, you have to hurry  home 
and try to get into  the basement or 
somewhere to hide, because this is 
the Œ we are attacked from the air by 
Germ any
. 
I remember then walking b
ack, I saw a woman Œ I don™t 
know how I re
me mb er th at, 
but carrying a pillow with 
blood on it. And sh e said 
my daughter was hit by Œ 
whether by shrapnel, or whether by a bric

house, that her Œ her head 
was on that pillow when her 
daughter was, and she was 
crying and carrying before we got to our

 in 1933 Œ 32 first, 
and completed in ™34 for non-aggression pact. So 
supposedly we were free on the east, but 
unfortunately, the Russians broke it. To 
this day they  say there was no war. So, fo

take care of them. They were the ref

communists who were, as they expressed it,
 they were waiting to go to paradise, 
you know, Russian paradise. So, at that 
time, the Œ there was eight men and one 
woman, a wife of one of them. And sh e real
ized that my mother
 didn™t know Œ she 
wasn™t dressed. The soldier for bed Œ fo

close the bathroom 
door, that she could dress a
nd no Œ get all together that
 we could dress. And he 
stood at the door, open door, and they woul
dn™t give us any keys to the attic, where 
we had our luggage, that we could use it. 
They were afraid to leave us without the

Lódz
, I 
believe, she realized Œ she took the capes, 
or covers of a bed,
 spread out and put 
some pillows and some clothing. She opene
d the shelves of some of the chest Œ 
chest of drawers, she took some of the th

although there were two big bundles,

who finished  Œ was just finished high school,

But we waited there two and a half hours,

had a good head on his shoulder

th

had the name of

Perestroika
 starte d, 
Gorbachev 
brought the letters sh owing that there were the camps of

have to prepare, and I didn™t like it, as a 
child. Oh, good th

cause I wouldn™t eat it. But that 
was at the beginning. And then  afterwards
, one wo man had the can of tripes, and 
she opened it, and she gave it to the child
ren, one spoon each. 
And it was so good. 
Until I reached Œ r

woman who was quite elderly. She mu st ha

Vicovnya

recently was opened up on the Russian, near

didn™t have enough room to take prisoners to 
Russia
, and they would shoot the 
prisoners and th row them through the wi

what I know from eyewitnesses,
 that they were one level,

the things. And I know that was Œ

of the book, and he asked Œ and he Œ there

Allen Paul

Washin gton
, and several senators came,  and Po
lish, you know, consulate Œ consul 
and officials listened for it, and so I wa
s started saying how we were taken to 
Russia 
and that. And then at one point, I said
, I have to stop here, suddenly, and 
stopped this, what I™m talking about, and tu rn
 to real heroes of this thing. Imag Œ 
now that I am a mother, beca
use back then , it was in 1990 so mething, I already had 
five children. Now that I am a mother, I can
 understand the tragedy of a mo ther who

could, for a blouse you could get three

would give us a first chaff of
 wheat. So we burned the chaff on top of the stove that 
was iron, and put in the water, so the waterhad the taste, and that was our soup that 
we ate. And these things happened, and I Œ 
I didn™t say exactly at that time, but I 
mean, this was a woman who, as you sa

they said that the Œ because the harves

somehow let the horsed Œ the horses who we
re waiting with the carts to take the 
wheat to the magazines in the 
big cities, or wherever they
 were taking, eat the wheat 
while waiting. So what was left, they 
still had to put the taxed amount to th e 
government, and what was left, so  very Œ 
I think th ey brought 
it on themselves to a 
certain degree, that they didn™t have too

helping us, from time to time sending some

And always asking us to co
me and tell him how we are.
 My mother was, at one 
point very sick. She had heart problem, 
and she had kidney problem, whatever. And 
the docto r told us that she cannot drink 
too much water, because
 of the heart, to

re mother-in-law Œ a

mo ther-in-law, had some friends who lend
 us her Œ some money, who paid the Œ 
some ticket transportation, and came in the boat. 
Q: Did you land here in

A: In the Œ February, ™52. 1952. 
Q: In February 1952. 

A: Late February . 
Q: Did you ever go back to

A: I visited 
Lvov
 couple of times. It was sti

Poland
 was 
by then free, there were cha
nges. In 90 Œ 1996 was th
e year they had the Œ my  
elementary school, had the 180
th
 anniversary, and they  somehow in vited some 
people wh o were at the school. And my  br
other, who lives in eng Œ one of them 
lives in

England
 they were much more conn ected, they knew more of 
the things and he told us that 
there is a chance to go to Œ to

 here, and we went 
together to Œ to Œ 

Q: 
Lvov
. 
A: Œ 
Poland
. 
Q: Yeah. You have shared today a really 
Œ an amazing story. As I said earlier, it 

would be very hard to  believe that all of
 these things happened
 to one person, and 
that, you know, for Œ it starts with a 12 
year old girl who has a normal life up until 
that point, and between age 12 and age 
19, goes through so many different Œ I 

mean, hell and back. What would you wa
nt Œ wh at would you want younger 
generations to understand about all of this? About these experiences? What do you 

think you™d want to pass on to them? 
A: That™s a very difficu lt question. You have
 to stick to your ethics, to wh at you 
learned as a Œ wh ether it was only in school, 
or it was only in religion, or also only 
from watching your parents, wa
tching the people Œ I Œ I c
onsider myself lucky that 
even in 
Africa
 in the high school, we had ex tremely good people, honorab le people,

who were thinking along the lines that I was thinking, not 
carpe diem
 type of thing 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ not lightly look at Œ at life. Be of some use to humanity. Be a Œ a person who 
has lived, but gave something of herself to 
the Œ to return for 
good, that some how I 
received from time to time, 
throughout these difficult ti
mes. And also, I wo Œ 
maybe I always wanted something more seri
ous, even if Œ I remember in small Œ in 
the small grades they Œ that 
I wasn™t a flighty, stupid, 
young girl, who just from one 
ice cream would go to a stupid movie a
lthough my  parents would know where I 

could go, or where I shouldn™t go. But an
yway, I think th at 
life is much more 
serious than just to catch up, 
or a false fame by so mething Œ 
Q: When you were in 
London
, right befo Œ before you 
met your husband, and you 
said you didn™t find any co
mmon language so metimes, and 
I wanted to ask you: did 
you feel lonely? I mean, you ha
d gone thro ugh su ch experi Œ 
[loud noise] 
[technical difficulties] [break] 
I guess I wanted to wrap
 up the interview with, 
what your final thoughts would be, and wh at you were ab le to maintain, and how 

you felt you had changed, if 
you had ch anged. Wh at final words would you want to 
leave with people?

A: As I me ntioned, and you suggested that
 actually I didn™t have childhood; I was 
still standing mentally to a certain degree,
 or psychologica
lly, a 12 year old girl who 
had to so metimes face more difficult things
, working to Œ to ge
t something to eat Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ or to help my mother to help 
us. That made me much more aware of 
seriousness of life. And wh en I came to 
England
, to Œ so  to speak to normal life, 
and went to 
London
, and lived in 
London
, met some other people, I still was not 
hungry for light Œ kind of young 
teenagers like nowadays you see Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ an Œ around, wh ether on television, or you met during that Œ 
Q: Sure. 
A: Œ stay in a Œ in 
England
. I wanted to study. I was ve
ry close to my mother, and 
somehow they si Œ some of the girls that I 
w o rked at the cook™s 
office, that I said I 

work ed after the second job in  
Lo ndon
, that I don™t know 
how you live like that; 
you are so close to your mother; whether 
you will be able to get married, because 
you won™t cut yourself off that closeness. 
But I Œ I think that was maybe this Œ and 
maybe something of a 
un-conscience 
way of holding to so mething that holds me to 
pre-war times, that holds me to my fathe
r, in a sense, to the time when I was Œ

A: Œ somehow Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ mo re serious looking at
 life, and also when Œ in 
the high school, I rememb er 
that I developed that feeling that the teachers and the ch airman of our Œ director of 

our high school said, which was accordin
g to wh at I was thinking and what my 
father taught me, that by y
our behavior, you are ambassador
 of your country. And I 
never stopped loving 
Poland
, and always thinking that 
maybe some ter Œ something 
might happen, like the things that you did 
not plan happened, th
at you will go back. 
And th Œ I will never got rid of my
 hope that Œ a-and longing for 
Lvov
. And I 
visited 
Lvov
, then afterwards I visited twice or three times later. 
Lvov
 was very 
neglected, and you could see th
e Œ kind of Uk rainians trying
 to cut all the traces to 
Pola nd ism
, and I could not find th e names of the 
street that I knew, because first of 
all they were changed, but 
they were changed in the Uk
rainian alphabet. So I didn™t 
ever learn that Ukrainian, so Œ but I stil
l had a feeling that I was walking on my

A: It has the effect, or somehow if people
 would talk to each
