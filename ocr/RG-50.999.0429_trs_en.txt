>> Bill Benson:  Jill, welcome. Thank you very m uchf or being will ing to beour
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
today.  It's really good to have you here.
  
 
W e're going to start right away because you have so 
m uch to share with us in our shortperiodof  tim e.
  
 
 
You toldm e that 
f o r 
yourf am ily, Kristallnacht was the catalyst 
that led to their decisions to leave Germ any and endup in Kenya. That was in 1938.  You 
were born in 1933. W hy don't we start with you telling us about your fam ily, comm unity, what 
lif e was like bothbefore the war and theevents that led up toKristallnacht.
 
>> Jill Pauly: W ell,I can only answer you wit h a5
-
year
-
old's m em ory.  And sinceI was born 
af t e r Hit le r 
cam e topower, I don't rem embera norm al lif estyle.
 
 
I was born the 1st of May.  T hat was the day that theGermans 
celebrated Hitler's becom ing chancellor. And for a Jewish baby to be born that day was 
treacherous
, b
ut I was born. And m y uncle had to drive m y m other to the Jewish hospital in
 
Cologne
. T hey tookme hom e, I suppose.  
 
 
I don't rem em ber thef irst two years.  I have early childhood 
m em oriesof  never being able to play with other children
, o
f always b eing in the house, and 
having ver y l ittle exposure even to the backyard. W hen I went out, it was with an adult. I 
rem em ber when I was ver y little thatm y grandm other still walked tothe cemetery on 
Saturdays
; n
ot every week, but 
o
f ten. And I would walk with her.  I rem em ber the synagogue.  
I  a ls
o rem em ber the green grocer. I don't rem em ber why, but he'snot thereanymore.  I 
checked. T he store is nota green grocery anym ore.
 
 
I remember littlethings.  I rem em ber darkening, putting things

over the windows, 
b
lock outour light.  Of course, Ididn'tunderstandwhat that was, but I 
presum e,having reada lot abouthow the Jews of  Germ any li ved during those years,anything 
to keep theoutside world out was practiced.
 
 
Inside the house, O
rthodox Judaism  was practiced. W e were 
O
rthodox Jews. W hen I was 2, the Nurem berg Laws were put inplace, and kosher 
slaughtering was f orbidden.  Def iantly
,  
m yf am ily continued to do kosher slaughtering
 i
n  ve r y 
clandestine ways.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  T hey took the chickens andm aybe sm all calves to the attic. Threeof m y 
uncles were certif ied kosher slaughterers. The big beef , when they needed it or wanted it
 
--
 
an 
uncleof m ine was thebutcher part of thef amily business.  My f am ily was in the cattlebusiness
 
a
nd doing very, ve
r y we ll u n t il Hit le r c am e .  My U
ncle Ernest set himself up a way of  
slaughtering the cattle.  He had to be terribly caref ul because theneighbor next door was a 

Nazi.  And they usedto watch everything that went on in the yard. So he devised a system  
wher
eby he would slaughter the cow, andthen he would take a gunand shoot into the severed 
head.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the neighbors would think
 
--
 
>>
 
Jill Pauly:  T hat hedidn'tdo kosher slaughtering.  I wonder now, of  course,had they known 
how seriously they wer e endangering them selves.  T hey m ight havelived by the laws of  the 
T o r ah
 
which says in order to survi ve you m ay doanything.  But the Jews at that time didn't 
know what thef inal solution wouldbe, so they were just def iantas long as they could be

without being conf rontational.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I recall you telling m ethat they would hide the ritualknives in the chimney.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   T h e
y hid the knives.  They taped the big knives insidethe chim ney andthe 
lit t le  
knives they threw in wi th the cutlery.  Andthey were raided twice.  So they were gi ven away by 
som ebody
, e
ither by other Jews who m ight have thought they knew or just people.
 
>
> Bill Benson:  You've describedLechenich, the town where you were born and lived, asa 
ver y ancient city.  And your f am ily actually we nt back centuries.T ell us a little bitaboutthat.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  I hadalways beentoldthat theancestors cam ef rom
 
the region where I was 
born,and I started reading a great deal. My m other gota book inthe 1950's that som eone 
wrote which had very l i m ited inf orm ation,but it did say that thef irstancestor that they could 
f ind of the Berg fam ily dated back to 1699. 
 
And about two weeks ago som eone sent me a 
genealogy, which is a crossover of m y mother andfather because they were very distantly 

related.  And thef irst date that I read on the genealogy is 1711. Sowe
 
know that even during 
the 1600
s there were Jews li vin g in the greater
 
--
 
you know, along the R
h
ineland, outside of
 
Cologne
. 
 
C o l o gne
 
has a very, ver y ancient Jewish history.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was your extendedf am ily gi ven that your fam ily had such long 

roots in that com munity?  How m uch of anex
tended fam ily?
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh, God.  Do Ihave now?
 

>> Bill Benson:  Back then.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Hundreds and hundreds of people.  My grandm otherhad100 f irst cousins in the 

c i t y o f  
K r ef el d
.  And I got that genealogy.  I readm y grandm other's age

to read it again before the next tim e I speak
, b
ut I recall that I think she was the only survi vor of  
that age
-
group. T hat gives you some idea where six m illion cam ef rom . 
 
W e found som e 
survi vors of  thenext
 
--
 
m y f ather's generation. W ith afam ily that size, obviously som e people 
were lucky.  
I think I found four cousins o
f  m y fa the r's.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: T hat survived.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hat survived.  Buthedidn't know they survi ved.  Five cousins.  One hefound 
while he was li ving.  But
 
the others,they came out after he passed awa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jill, in those years before Kristallnacht and the war beginning, you were too 

young to go to schoolat that tim ebut your sister
,  
I n ge
, 
began her schooling.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  It was very rough.  First they let her go topublic school in Lechenich
 w
hen she 
was 6, that was 1935,and shealready had aver y hard tim e with being discriminated against in 
the school, by childrenand the teachersnotbacking her up, backing up the children.  Shegot 
in
to it with a couple ofboys.  And she hitoneof  them.  Andhehad a bloody nose. And she 
ran home.  Andm y parentsdecided to take her outof the school.  And she was sent away 

f rom hom e tom y grandm others where therewas a little Jewish school, one classroom .  Ithad 
a teacher with every gr ade in it. I think up tobar m itzvah age.  He was a genius.  He taught all 
of  those children individually, beautif ully.  
 
 
And I have to tell you,his nam e was L
a ra  Gottlie b . I th in k Im u st 
have seen him .  He was sucha kind soul.  He had such aheart.  He said, I never did anything 

to anyone. I read about him . There was a write
-
up about him
 a
fte rth e  wa r.  I go tth e ma teria l.  
He would nothide himself.  Andhedidn't think it was necessary to run away because he d
idn't

have any enem ies.  He never did anything toanyone. And he died in the camps.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was the teacher of your sister.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  M y sister 's teacher.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jill, November
 
9, 10,1938,Kristallnacht, the Night of  theBroken Glass
, t
e ll u s  
what happened that night, what happened toyour f am ily, whether or not you recall anything 
personally, what you know about itf rom  other fam ily m em bers. 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Som eofthefam ily m em bers were put in the concentration camps. 
 
That I know.  
Oneof  them  survived.  He was 16.  He already had papers to leaveGerm any, and six weeks 
af ter he was arrested he was allowed to leave.  Others, they somehow got outof the camps if  
they had where to go.And they had papers.Some of them got out. Som eof  them  didn't. 
 
Butm ainly, that incarcerationthat was doneon Kristallnacht was like a warning. T hey tortured 

them en terribly.  I read up. T here are books
 
--
 
a m an wrote hisexperience.  I readhis 
experience.  Sadistic, cruel, horrible
 
treatm ent.  But they let a lot of  them  out
 a
f t e r six we e ks.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Andfor many of them  they would let them out only because they said you 
have to leave Germany.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  And f or those people they recovered.  I remember seeing som eone in 

1939, inearly 1939.  He cam e to visit us in
 
Cologne
, where we wer e supposedly in hiding.  He 
was a relative of m ine's brother.  He was going to carry m y grandmother when we lef t. T hey 

m ade arrangem ents to carry her f rom  theapartm ent to the train 
in
 
Cologne
. She could no 
longer walk.  She hadcancer. She was dying.  Andthe Nazis didn't have a lot of usef or sick 

people, so it was ver y dangerousf or her to be takenout.  But he volunteered
a
f ter com ing out.

He was ver y courageous
, t
hat he would 
carry her to the train
 a
nd  he d i d .  A n d I  r em em ber  
seeing him.  He looked horrible
,  gr
ay, if a person can have gray skin,  he looked
 
gr a y
.  H
is  h a ir
 
--
 h
e was a young m an.  His hair was stubbles.  Hollow.  I was a littlef rightened of him  
because I had never seen anyone look likethat. That was after six weeks.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he night of  Kristallnacht your synagogue was burned,as were hundredsof  
other synagogues throughoutGermany andAustria.  Do you rem em berthat?
 
>>
 
Jill Pauly:  Yes.  Of course Ido.  Ido. Kristallnacht, we were in the house.  T here was a 
knock on thedoorat 9:00
 
inthe morning.  A righteous gentile knocked on the door and toldm y 
fam ily thatthe men should not goto the synagogue that day
;  
tha t s
om ething really terrible was 
going to happen.  It was 9:00, andm y father hadn'theard anything.  It wasn't on the radio.  
And he said, 
ﬁW
hat's going to happen?
ﬂ
  
And the m an said, 
ﬁ
I don't know what's going to 
happen, but I'm  telling you don't gothere.  
Listen to m e.
ﬂ
  
Sothey didn't go. And about 20 
m inutes later or so thephone started ringing with relatives in other areas telling them todo 
som ething because houses were being invaded andpeople were being chased out, that 
homes were being broken,do something,hide yourself, they were picking up the menand 
s e n d i n g t hem  t o t he cam p s .  
 
 
So what they were doing, really, the Nazis, they were using the 
synagogues, especially, to pick up the menthatobserved and send them  to the camps.  Itwas 
a gathering 
place. 
 
 
So instead of  going to the synagogue there was a lot of 
scream ing. I rem em ber the noise in the house.  It was terrible. W ewere seven people in the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
house.  AndI was f rightened because there was scream ing.  My gra ndmother jumped outof  
her chair
 
and said
, "W
e're leaving.
  
C
all somebody to drive us to
 
Cologne
.  W
e' r e l e a vi n g. "  
 
 
You know, just leaving and hiding in a country where it's so 
dangerous to gooutside
, y
ou really hadto think
 
--
 
how to plan inf ive m inutes where you're 
going to go.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  She said on the spot we areoutof  here.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Because somebody called andsaid com etoour house.  Andm y father said, not 

com ing to your house. You know, hem ust have thought, well, I'm not saf e here, why would I 
be safe there? 
 
 
So what we did,again, a righteous gentile was wil ling to drive 
us, m y grandparents,m y sister and I,away f rom  thehouse. And when we got outside, we 
went into billows of smoke. W esaw the sm oke and thef lames of the synagogue. W e were 
terrorized.  W e
 
were absolutely terrorized. W e started scream ing. W e were being separated 
f rom m y m other andfather.  We were put into the car.  My grandm other had diff icult
y 
controlling us so she put usonthef loorboards of  the car with ourf aces down.  Sheput her f
eet 
onm y sister and m y gr andfather had to put his two f eetonm eto keep usf rom looking outthe 

windo w.  Andthat quietedus down.  
 
 
So I know thatthe synagogue burned. 
  
Shealso didn't want us 
to see the other synagogues burning because there were a lotof f ires on the way to
 
Cologne
.  
Right bef ore we got out of  the car she letus up, and we saw f ires in the distance.  Horrendous 
night.

>> Bill Benson: W hy did you go to
 
C o l o gne
? 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  No w that I've read a lot, it seems when the Jews got f r
ightened
 
--
 
the majority of  
Jews in Germ any lived in small villages.  Andwhen they gotf rightened, when they were 
persecuted, they lef t their hom es and wenttolive
 
--
 
they thought going into big cities, they'd be 
dispersed am ongstother people,nobody would know them . That'sthe only reason.W e went 

to
 
Cologne
 
because I think she didn't know where else to go.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had somefam ily there.  Right?
 
>> Jill Pauly: W e hadfam ily.  The grandm other and grandf ather went into like a senior li
vi n g  
place. And we m ovedin, eight or10people intoanapartm ent thathousedfour people. So we 

were 12, 13 people livi ng under really, ver y re stricted conditions. 
 
 
My f atherand his brother and the cousins,f ive men who were in 
thebusiness, the Berg 
brothers
 
--
 
I realized that overnight when I thought about it, he didn'tget 
in the car with m y m other.  He got in anothercar becausethosef ive m en drove all night long 

until they hadno gasoline. And then they cam eback
 
--
 
a woman told m e this50 years
 
later.  
T he one gasoline station thatthey knew thatthey couldtrust to getm ore gas in the car. And 

they just kept driving.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Essentially just not staying st ationary anywhere, just driving around.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Exactl y.  Or going into the woods som etim esand com ing out again. But they did 
not stay stationary.  And it happened, I believe, on aThursday.  If  any of youhave read or 
studied, it was decided the next morning at10:00
 
it was over. W henhe said it was over, it was 
over.

>> B
ill Benson: T his was happening all over Germ any.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   A ll o ve r G e rm an y.  
 
 
S o  afte r th a ttim e
,  
they came into
 
Cologne
. They tried to work 
out where they were going to hide with us. So m yf ather decided the sam e thing that Uncle 

Frank did.  Hedecided to go into an attic.  I don't rem em ber it. Because it must have been a 
ver y short tim e. T here is a living relati ve who  is of  sound m ind. She's 95 or96.  Idon't know.  
I did questionher about it, and she said it was in the sam ehouse where we were li ving.  T here 
was an atticupstairs. They were going to m ake that their hiding place.  But itdidn't work out.  
And I have to say, thank God it didn't work out.  My sister had scream ing nightmares. So that 
would have been a dead giveawa y. 
 
 
So then
 
they decided they're leaving the country.  T hey didn't 
have papers. But it was a good decision. They took the car,fam ily car, the threem en, two 
brothersand a cousin, and they drove into Holland. And they got caught.  And that's a whole 
other segm ent
.  
>> Bill Benson: T ell us just a little bitaboutthat. They got apprehendedby the Dutch
, b
y 
Du t c h  Na zis .
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappened to them  there?
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hey we re put in prison.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Holland.
 
>> J ill P a
uly:  In Holland.  Ionly just discovered this75 years later. W here we lived was one

hour by car to Holland.  I saw the sign. Otherwise
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: W ouldn't have realized it was  so close.
 
>>
 
Jill Pauly:  I didn't realize how they couldhave gone. 
 
 
I had two other uncles and anaunt who wentto Holland in1937, 
legall y, because they couldno longer
 
--
 
they were not well to do
.  T
hey hadno incom e. One of 
them  used to work for the Berg brothers in the business, but theb
usiness
 
was closeddown.  
T he 1st of January
 
1937.  I just read that.  Sothey had to leave the country. T hey had no way 
of  surviving.  So they went to live in Holland.  
 
 
So by 1938 Novemberthey had been there alm osttwo years.  
T hey were not allowed to work.  Jew that came into Holland causeda big problem  

econom ically.  I think there were 40,000 of them . T hey were notallowed to work.  Sothey had 
to live onm oneys that m y f am ily had sm uggled out the day I was born. 
 
T hey had a chunk of  
m oney in Holland.  Sothe family had to live on that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And by doing that theday you were born in1933, yourf am ily was anticipating 
there was aday that they were going to haveto leave.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  M y grandm other.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your grandm other did.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  She didn't know we had to leave but she knew she didn't trust the Nazis.  Soshe 

wouldn't allow the fam ily business to put their m oney
 
--
 
leave their money in the banks.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So she had it
 
hidden in Holland.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  No.  Actually, one of the uncles, the oldest one, used to take vacations in the

m ountains. That wasa picture of him. T hatwas the one.  He met som eone there who was an 
extraordinarily wealthy Jewish m anf rom  Holland. 
 
And he turnedoutto be the court Jew.  He 
had access to the queen.

T here was a child in the same

oneof her successf ul cousins was a very wise  m an who decided to leave Germany and went 

to England in1934 and started a business.Andhebroughthis younger brother to England to 
study law.  And when the brother graduated in 1937, he was hired by a prestigious law f irm in 
Nairobi, Kenya.  So she had this contact.  And she kept going,f or three months,every sin gle

for those visas, the price went up af ter that. I think you said it went to 250

I was told that that was lowered again. T hey tried it or 
som ething. They wanted to

paying that backf or years.  
Be
cause the Bergs didn't have it left. W henthey got to Kenya, 
although they were well to do, they had justenough when they came together with the little bit

So thefact that they were well to do in Germany
 
--
 
m y m other 
alwa ys told me that we did not get out of Germ any with m oney.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou were not allowed to take money out,butyou could purchase goods 

if  you could get them .
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh, they did that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you began trying to preparef or 
th is  t rip .
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh m y God. It was really f unny when you look back now.  T hey didn't have 

anything to do. So they took m oney, and they went shoppingf or theforeseeablefuture in 
Af rica.  And the women bought sevenbig lif ts, the size of  a sm al

T hey bought sewing m achines, ref rigerators,cutlery, whatever.  Chil dren's clothingf orf ive 

years.  And it was a big f am ily.  So Ithinkthere were seven lif ts.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he idea was it would be shipped to Kenya
 
with yo u.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hat was the idea.  But the Germ anshad a great idea.  It was all shipped to 
Ham burg, andthey stole halfof  them
 a
ndthen two or three of them  arrived.  My m other was 
lucky, one of hers arrived. And so they started com municating, what happenedtoour lif ts? So 

they said they went down.  T hey didn't go down.  T hey were stolen. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you had hoped to be able to takeall of  this with you, but you weren'table 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

to. But you were able to make thetrip.  You lef t, I believe, in June
 
1939.  T ell us about that 
journey, taking that trip to go to Kenya.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh, that was serious stuff .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And just to rem ind the audience, war hadnotactually begun yet.  It wouldn't 
begin until Septem ber
 
1 when Germ any would invade Poland. So this was just right bef ore the 
actualbeginning of the war years.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  It was bad.  It was like eight weeks before the war broke out. The train, of 
course, wasf ull of Nazis.  And m y mother knew that.  And she also
 
knew thata trip to Kenya 
would be extraordinarily strenuousfor m y sick grandmother, herm other.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had several grandparents with you.  Didn't you?
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hree. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hree.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  And she askedm y grandmother whether she was sure that she could take this 
trip.  It was very, ver y strenuous andhot.  And m y grandm other said
 
--
 
m y grandm other, bless 
her, said, "
I
f  Idieon the train tom orrow, I'm  not staying in this place."   Saved m y life.  Because 
had she said, you're right, I can'tm ake it, who would have taken care of the grandmother? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you went.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  So we went.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmade your way out of Germ any.
 
>> Jill Pauly: W e had to be very, ver y caref ulthat we weren
't separated.  T he wom en had 

m ade plans with eachother, documentedplans on what todo in case certain things happened.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
Because they felt they couldbe thrown off  the train and we would be on thetrain with the sick 
grandm other. Or they could throw all our luggage awa y and we wo uld have nothing to deal 
with.  So they m ade plans.
 
 
So what we were told,we were not tom ove on the trip. Couldn't 
go to the bathroom, couldn'taskf or water. W e were not tof ight. Itwas very serious business.  
And m y m other
 
gotthrough to me. She did. If oundout thatm y little cousin, who was
 
--
 
ughh, 
he was bad.  He was 18 months old.  He'sa big donor here now.
 
[Laughter]
 
He scream ed, kicked,carried on.  He was really bad.  You know, children were neglected 

under those
 
conditions.  So Ifound out that his m other gave him whiskey. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the secret, huh?
 
>> Jill Pauly:  She put him  to sleep. She was a nurse. So she knew what she was doing. And 
he slept f rom
 
C o l o gne
 
into Switzerland.  Af ter Swit zerland we didn'tcare.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You crossedthe border then.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  And I rem em ber very vi vi dly the sm ilethat broke out on my mother'sface 
when we went intoSwi tzerland out of Germany.  It didn't last
 
lon g.  Ju st tha tm om en t. 
Because once we got to Italy, all sortsof  problem s. It was really hot.  And we didn't really
 
--
 
we had no money.  Every Jew that left Germany was allo wed 10
 
ma rk
.  Som ehow we went 
into a hotel. Som ebody must have had something
, o
vernight or over two nights.  And thenwe 
had to get back on a Nazi ship.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's the amazing thing tom e. T he ship youhadto take was a Nazi ship, to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
21
 
Kenya.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T here was a reasonf or that. They wanted to controlusf rom
 
Cologne
 
to  
Mom basa.  And 
if  we hadm oney, we m ight have gone som ewhereelse.  Everything was li ke a 
m iracle. W hen we gotto Kenya, they want tobe sure if  they're getting rid of  the Jews, that 
they know where they'r e going.
 
 
So the Nazi ship was very, very dem eaning for m y m other 
because they separated the Jews f rom the other human beings. W e were on a separate level.  
Shebecam e very angr y, really angr y.  Sheactedout.  She resisted in a way.  Wehad a 
separate lunch room. Diapers were notas usef ul as
 
they are today.  My little cousin, every 
tim e we ate in thedining room ,he left a puddle under thehighchair and hism other wanted to 

clean itup, andm y m other said, 
ﬁN
o, you don't.  You do not clean itup. They putus inhere 
lik e  t h is
;  
let them  clean
 
it up.
ﬂ
  
She wasn't being funny.  She was being def iant. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do I rem ember correctly that in ordertoeven get on the ship you had one 
grandparent who didnot want to go becausethey weren't serving ko sherf ood.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh, yeah.  My
 
grandfather wouldn't go anywhere withoutbeing absolutely 
assuredthat there would be kosherfood.
 
>> Bill Benson:  On this Nazi ship. 
 

>> Jill Pauly:  On the Nazi ship.  Nobody explained tohim
 
--
 
he really knew Je wish law.  He 
knew it was dangerous, too.  Butnobody internalized thef inal solution.  Nobody internalized 

thatthey would go asfar as to murderpeople for this
, f
or whatever they wanted.  So he still 
stuck to the Jewish rules.  Andhe said he needed kosherf oodonthe Nazi ship.  Someone 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
pickedup a phone and called Berlin and we got kosherf oodonthe ship.  Nuts. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And while you were on the ship, you hadalso this am azing experience that 
was ver y f rightening to your m other in that the ship
 
--
 
if  I remembercorrectly, the ship's captain 
heard you singing, a little girl, you were singing.  T ell us
 
about
 
tha t.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  I rem ember always singin g wit h m y grandmother.  And the singing m ust have 
stopped on Kristallnacht
 
anddid not occur because we were separated in
 
Cologne
.  W he n I  
got on the ship,there was sunlight, andthere were people
; 
I started singing again.  And Iwas 
overheard. And m y mother was asked to com e see the captain. She was ver y f rightened.  
Because
 
he was a Nazi captain.  But he wasok.  He said to her would shem ind if  I could sing 
for the crew.  I didn't know about it.  
 
 
She was extrem ely upset. Because while we were locked up in
 
Cologne
 
with nothing to do, m y mother's uncles, who hadm agnif icent voices
 
--
 
o n e of  t h em  
was an opera starbutalso very Orthodox, preparedm efor the 
P
assover Seder
 
in  m u s ic .  I  
sang the whole thing.  
 
 
W hat do you think I was singing?  Not altogether.  I sang 
Germ anfolk songs aswell.  So I remem ber the grandm others,

 t

, n
ow looking back.  It was funny. 
  
First of all, when we 
arrived, I hadn't seen m y f atherfor al
m ost a year.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because they had gottenthere before you.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  And I see this manon the harborthere in Mom basa.  He's wearing a dark 
gra y suit and a white shirt and ahat, European hat.  He was theonly one.  Everybody else
 
wa s  
in tropical. So I picked himoutof  the crowd.  It was hot, like here today.  Hot. I don't

I don't know what day, ifwe arri ved on aSabbath.  I 
don't know. W alking, riding, I don't rem em ber.  
 
 
But the f irst
 
culture shock I really rem em ber was really hilarious 
becausem y father had taken a room f or thefour of us to sleep in Mom basa, somewhere. It 

couldhave beena hotel.  I don't know.  Andever ybody in thetropics had to sleep under a 
m osquitonet.  And we
 
hadto learn that, the f irst night.  Ithought I was suffocating, but we had 
to sleep underam osquito net. And all of a sudden I hear thishorrible scream . It was m y

She said, 
ﬁM

room bringing m e anything.
ﬂ
  
She had just lef t Nazi Germany. T here were a lot off unny things.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwasn't sof unny was thef act that Kenya was a British colony.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   Yu p .
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're living no w under British colonial rule. W hat was that like? 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T heanti
-
Sem itism  continued in a differentform.  It was hardbecausethere are 
rules and regulations,and youalways f elt suppressed. But it wasn't like Nazis. W hen we f irst 
got to Kenya, we lived in a greatbig house that belongedtoa Lordand 
L
ady Napier.  Andwe 
were all, 18 of us,17, who knows, li ving in one housefor afew weeks.  
  
 
But while thef am ily m em bers were lookingfor af arm  to buy
 
--
 
a
ndm y father was in it Africa. Andhe was afraid of  wild animals. So he inquired to see where 
he could buy af arm  that would be the least exposed to wilderness. So he boughtaf arm .  
T hey boughta beautif ul farm  in abeautif ulplace only 20
 
m ilesoutside of  Nairobi. And yes, 
indeed, we didn't have lions walking around or elephants or giraffe,but we had snakes and 

hyenas
 
every night. W e learned to live with them .  He learned to live with them .  
 
 
He loved thef arm .  My father always said theeight happiest 
years of his lif e were on thef arm ,because whenhe left thefarm, he was discrim inated 
against.  He was swart hy.  He had blackhairandbrown eyes.  He looked very m uch likethe 
Indian Indians who were alsodiscrim inatedagainst and weren'tallowed to use European 
hotels.  So whenever he cam e to visit us in Nairobi, he would be sitting in f rontof  thedoor.

And I would say 
ﬁP
apa, why are you inf ront ofthe door?
ﬂ
  
He said,

I got kicked out again.

So oneof  the reasons, I suppose, he couldn't wait to leave Kenya was because he wanted the

>> Bill Benson: W ith the war beginning in Septem berof  that year, 1939, and,of  course, then 

Englanddeclared war on Germ any, in one ofthose very i ronic twists  you were now vie wed as 
enem iesof  the state.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hat's right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Explain that.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   Ye s .   A ll G e rm an  J e ws
 
--
 
it was hardfor me to understandfor 50 years, and then 
I learned a little bit about
 
it. TheBritish decided thatall Germ an Jews neededtobe sentfar 
away f rom  Nairobibecause we could be adanger to the country, not women and children, 

m en.  Because they could be spiesfor Germ any.  Now, I can't imagine,of  course,anyonewho 
was sane
 
who could im agine that Jews woul d be spying f or Germany.  I mean, the 
discrim ination hadbeen in placefor six years.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had f ledGermany. But because you're Germ an citizens, youare, 
therefore, an enem y alien.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   A n  e n
emy alien. W hen the war broke out,all the menwere picked up and put 
into cam p.  Ourf am ily got out.  All them en got out. BecauseI think they had put the 
down 
paym ent
 
on thef arm  so that the governm entwould know where they would be. All the men 
that
 
were in those camps had to stay there until they had jobs somewhere in Kenyaf araway 
f rom  Nairobi.  Andthey becam e managersfor theBritish men whohad to go to Arm y servic e.

It thenbecam e law that all the Germ an Jewish menhad tohave 
these jobsof  replacing people who had to gof ight in the war, Arm y duty.  So in m yf am ily t wo 
or three
 
--
 
m y father had Arm y duty, hisbrother did. I don't know wh y the others didn't. They 
m ay have, and I don'tknow.  But I don't think
 
--
 
well, t wo of them  couldn't speak a word of  
English, ever.  Didn't learn English. So they were useless. They m ight have been spies, but I 
don't know what language they were translating into. 
 
 
My f ather, I rem em berhis duty.  Andm y uncle, I rem em ber his, 
next door. My uncle had to carry a gun anddidn't know what to dowith it. 
 
 
For m e, there was a lot of discrim ination in the school.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because in order to get an education, which was very important to yourfam ily, 

you hadtobe in Nairobi for that, not on thefarm .
 
>
> Jill Pauly:  Actually, we were supposed tobe inboarding school,andmy motherandf ather, 
because they were kosher and didn't wantusto eat non
-
kosher f ood, decided to board us out 
instead.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Boarding school would have been an English boarding school.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  And if  you ever read"
N
owhere in Af rica" where a littlewom an,m y 
contem porary, wrote a bookabouther experience inKenya, God really held his handsover us.  
She had to eat 
mu t
to
n  
ever y day. W hen I read what she had to eat,I wouldn't have m ade it. 
 
 
So we lived with fam ilies outsideof  school who boardedus.  
And we went tothe educational system  in Kenya was notf ree. T hey were called governm ent 
schools,but you had to pay.  Andpeoplehad toearna lot of money to send

Andm y parents, although thef arm  was operating and producing, they had to starta sideline

>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  In the beginning they came with their superiors who camef or 
R& R
.  T he y 
loved it som uch that they would com e backwithout their superiorsif  they were transf erred.  
But unf ortunately m ost of  the soldiers that cam eto thefarm  in the early years were shipped off 
to

Bill Benson:  You would remain in Kenya until you were 14 years of  age,until af ter the war.  
Do you recall whetheror not yourfam ily hadany comm unication wit hf am ily m embers back in 
Germ any at all? And if your f am ily knew the extent of  what was happening in Europe, what 
was happening to you, what was happeningwith the Holocaust at that tim e? 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  During the war?
 

>> Bill Benson:  Yeah.  During the war years.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  In thebeginning a few letters arri ved. T he last letterprobably arri ved in 1941.  

Nothing was ever writt en about being put into, you know, into ghettoized Jew houses.
 
W ehave som e letters,if you can readbetween the lines

wa y that you realize they're hungry.  T hey not know.  They had no idea.
 
 
W elistened to the BBC ever y day on abatteried radioat night, 
ever y evening on thefarm . W ehad no electricity.  So we had a batteried radio.  And we had 
no electricity at allf or alm ost seven years on thefarm , which wasf ine.  Noproblem.  You can 
live  wit h o u t  e le c t ric it y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you could get the BBC.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   O n  t h is  th in g.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hearing the war news.
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Ever y e vening.  Andnothing wa s ever said about the Jews.  Nothing was eve r 
said about concentration cam ps.  It started com ing out practically the day the war was ove r 
because of a very sad and unique situation. T here were m aybea half
-
dozen menthat had 
becom ef riendly with m y parents because of the bedand breakf ast situation, socially f rie
ndly, 
that came all thetim e, who had left their wi ves and children in Europe and had come to scout 
out Kenya and the war brokeout so theirf am ilies stayed behind.  And the day the war was 
over they f ound out that they didn't have fam ilies anym ore. T hey started sending away f or 
wi ves.  T hey wanted to rem arry.  They needed to learnhow to date. It was really sad.  It was a 
ver y sad tim e.
 
 
I actually have

I knew I had

I'm  going to tell them  this.  I 
knew I had apictureof m y late Uncle George perf orm ing a wedding ceremony for one of these 
m en with a cam p survi vor girl.  And I couldn'tf ind thepictured.  Andthrough the Museum ,and 
through 
this wom an who wrote the book" Nowhere in Af rica," I reconnected with a womanwho

was in Kenya, whose husband wasf riendly wi thm y f ather. She's 103.  She got me asa 
connectionbetween herself and the Museum.  She rem em beredm e when I was 11 years old.  
She sent me a picture
o
f  this wedding. And in the lef t
-
hand corner in the top of the pictureare 
t wo  g ir l s  wi t h
 
big brown hats on.  It's Ingeand I at the wedding.  And that's how I started 
learning aboutthe Holocaust
, a
bout these wom en, these young wom en.  Noneof  those 
m arriages worked out.  They were em otionally not ready to getall dressed up and have their 

ha
irf ixed and com eto Kenya andm eet husbandsand marry.  It didn't work.  Anda lot of them 
just remarried again later.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Our tim e
 
--
 
we're just aboutup. There'sone morething I want to ask you 
about. 
 
 
Of course, it would notbe long bef ore you would learn the 
enorm ity of the lossesof your own fam ily.  Yo u said yourm other's, 100f irst cousins. None 
s u r vi ve d
, l
osing hundreds off am ily m em bers if not more. And the danger wasn't over for you 
either because in 1947 there was the beginning
 
of  the uprising in Kenya so your fam ily decided 
to pickup stakesandwere able to get into the United Statesand begin a new lif ehere. W e 
don'thave tim e to go into that in our conversationtoday, butI wantyou to tellus justa little bit 
bef ore we close, lastf all, fall of 2012, you were invited back by thetown you were born in to 
com e back. T ellus about that.
 
>> Jill Pauly: W ell,I had been invitedf orf ive years.  I wasn't readyto accept.  I'm  very 

conf licted.  Andf inally I decided that it was not right of me not to go because I was being 
invited by the granddaughter of a very ri ghteous gentile whohelped m y family.  I didn't know

this.  Ididn't understand it. But imm ediately af ter the war, one af ter the other wentback to 
Germ any to meet with this manand hisfam ily to thank him.  Andthis little girl started picking 
up allof  this inf orm ation.  Shedidn't know wh at the Holocaust was.  She didn't know what 
happened to theBerg fam ily.  And she developedan interest.  On avisit back, somehow
, I m e t 
her and she wanted me to come. She kept writing m e, I should come and visit and speak to 

the comm unity.  
 
 
I  f in a lly
 
--
 
when they got it togetherand did itthe right way, I 
accepted.  And I went in October. It was an interestingfour days.  Isp
oke to four schools 

where I canhonestly say I was not successful.  It's very diff icult to reach them .  I didn'tfeel 
successf ul.  But when I spoke tothe town, the m ain reason I went, this ver y big audienceto 
the town, I was ver y successf ul. And it had to do with age. I would say the average age of the 
townspeople were between 40 and70, and som e youngsters.  And in the schools they wer e 
really a m uch younger generation, the internet generation. Very hard to reach.  And it went 
ver y well.  T hey showed 
me
 
--
 
they were ver y,  ver y courteous. T hey showed Kurtand I a great 
tim e. Af terf our days I felt it was tim e tomove on. 
 
 
I'm  still conf licted.  Because in one sensethey were ver y polite, 
world m oves on, lif e goes on and yet Ifel
t  
very pulled in and
 
suckedin by the sadness that 
when you go back and you realize
 
--
 
it was like a tree that was choppedoff and ground upfor 
building purposesor som ething. The Jewish lif e just is gone
, e
specially in the small towns 
where them ajority of  the Jews lived in Germany.  Nothing. There's nothing there except 
cem eteries. And eventhose have to be guarded because they're being infringed upon.

And I'll tell you a little bit about inf ringem ent. T he synagogue 
that was burned was still
 
--
 
the hole in the ground was therefor 70 years.  Because whenever 
som ebody went back, they went to thathallowed ground. This time thisf riend shows m ea 
little synagogue that she discoveredacross the streetf rom  where the old one was.  It wasa 
lit t le  
row house
, a  little  to wn h
ousethat was used inthe 18th century bef ore the other one was 
built.  AndI said toher, 
ﬁW
hat's this synagogue?  W hat happened? T here were houses there.
ﬂ
  
She says, 
ﬁ
I haven't been herefor a long tim e.
ﬂ
  
Som eone in the town government had 
m anaged to pickupthat land, wrap som ething aroundthe law of holy ground, which is not 

supposedtobebuilt on, built two houses on it and put plaques that that used tobe where the 
synagogue was.  
 
 
And that's life going on.  You know? W hat can we expect?  
T here are Jews in Germ any, but there'snothing
 
--
 
nobody that would mean any growth went 
back of the Jews thatwere in Germ any bef ore the Holocaust. T heJews that arethere now are 
m ainly eastEuropean im m igrantsf rom Russia and students
, 
Jewish students.

J ill?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  I think what I lef tGermany with

or Vienna because we stopped f or a f ew days 
in Vienna

was m y gr atitude to God that wem ade it to the UnitedStates
, t
ohave had the 
Go d
-
given privilege of being able to live in afree society in a wonderf ul country with wonderf ul 
people.  
 
 
I thinkm y conf lict when I'm over there is thatI'm  homesick to get 
back to what I want tobe.  My culture isnotGerm an.  My culture is American. I lef t too early
, 
t
o have even am em ory of  that culture.  I recognize it.  But it's notmy culture.  And I'm  justver y 
grateful thatm y children were born here,m y grandchildre
n, and m y great granddaughter.  I'm  

happy to say they have absolutely
 
--
 
otherthan physical interestsof where we were and where 
we cam ef rom ,m y children have no interest of ever leaving the United States. T hat's what I'm  

happy about.
