Abstract
 
 

 

Laura Gruenbaum, born in 1911, discusses her 
brother Abraham, who wa s born January 17, 1908 
in Rozwadów. The fa mi ly built a six-room houseoutside of Rozwadów a
bout two years before 

World War I. Abraham was sent 
to gymnasium in Czechowice, a
nd then attended university in 
Krakow. Although he had the best  grades, as a Je
w, he was not admitted to me dical school in 
Poland, so he attended medical school in Prague fo
r a year or two. He returned to Poland and 
attended law school in Kr akow. He had a thri ving general law practice at the fa mily home 

outside of Rozwadów for two years 
before the Ge rmans invaded Poland. 
 

When they learned of the German invasion, Abraha
m, their sister Hanna, and a brother went to 
Russian-controlled Lvov, a four or
 five hour train ride.  They wa
lked and rode on a horse-drawn 
wagon part of the way.  

 

Germans later evicted La ura and her parents from their house, and they headed toward Lvov. 

ﬁNobody knows where to go–It was ju
st a terrible thing to live
 it through,ﬂ Laura says. 
 

They found Laura™s brothers and sisters in L
vov, and lived together. 
After a few weeks or 
months, Russians took La ura and her parents from 
the house, and sent them to Russia. Abraham 
and Hanna were out at their jobs. The Russians 
had given Abraham an office job. He moved in 
with a friend.  

 

In 1940 or 1941, Russians sent away rich
 Poles and others in cattle cars.  
 

After the war, Laura found the woman with w
hom Abraha m had lived.. She told Laura that 
Abraham said a ma n had warned him that the Russ
ians were comi ng for him. He said he would 
not sleep at her apartment that night. Neith
er she nor anyone else
 ever saw hi m again.

 it was nume rous clouds in Poland. So Jews 
they wouldn™t take, ______ (50), I don™t know what. Because ma rks he has the best but 

he wasn™t accepted. So my parents sent him 
to Czechoslovakia, to Prague, in a me dical 
school. He was there only a year

 or two and then came back and went to law 
school in Cracow? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. Let me ask you, your parents, 
what did your father do for a living? 
 

A:  {He wants you to tell him for the tape.} He 
was like in wholesale business. They have in 
theŠhow you call themŠthe big farmers, they ha
ve lots of things. They ma ke their own 
whiskey. They have their things. The produce and the machines and everything. But there 

were places in Poland that they had more 
than now itŠa place, or now an estate or 
some thing. So he was going there and buying like
 variants (76). A big amounts, ten tons, 
I don™t know. For those people, that was much
 cheaper than to buy there because they 
didn™t have in the industrial (
81) state where we were living. So that™s what it was. He 
was always on the go. 
 

Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about your house and what 
kind of street you lived on? 
 

A: The  houseŠwe lived not far from a town. But the rest yearsŠ 

 

Q:  So you lived a little bi
t outside of Rozwadów?   

5
 
A:  Yes, yes. So the last two years, no more th
an two years, my parents decided that they sold 
everythi ng and they moved to Rozwadów.  Bu
ilt a house, two years before, this I know, 

two years before the war. But he was stil
l in the same  business like he was buying big 
amounts of grain and he makes, he rent a 
mill and he makes flour for the bakeries. 
Around the thing, Rozwadów and other places, th
at needed, the stores and the bakers. So 
this was until the war.  
 

Q:  Do you remember what street you lived on in Rozwadów when you mo ved? 

 

A: Yes, Panska. P-a-n-s-k-a. 

 

Q:  Was it a big house or a medium house or--? 

 

A: Was six rooms. Yeah. He opened in that 
house and he finished in high school and he 
opened an office in the house.  
 

Q:  Opened an office in the house?  I see.
 Did your brother ever 
live in this house? 
 

A:  He did. 

 

Q:  He did?  How long before the war did 
your brother start law 
school in Cracow, do you 
reme mber?  A few years orŠnot pretty shortly 
before the war?  Not too long before the 
war? 
 

A:  I know that he finished law school, the house.
 He had to help practice with a lawyer. He 
was two years with the lawyer. After this, he
 opened a law for hims elf. What year, do you 
want to know? 
 

Q:  So he had finished law school and was 
already a practicing lawyer before the war? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah. He wa
s a practicing lawyer. 
 

Q: That™s what I wanted to 
know. Do you reme mbe r , what his office in Rozwadów?  Yes. Do 
you reme mb er where it was in the city? 
 

A:  On the same  street what I told you. 

 

Q:  The same  street your house was on? 

 

A:  Yeah. {I thought the office was 
in
 the house.} Yeah, that™s right. 
 

Q:  His offi ce was in the family home? 

 

A:  {Was in the house, right.} 

 

6
Q:  Now you said your father had 
an office also in your house? 
 
A: He don™t have an office because th
is was really an outside business. 
 

Q:  Must have been a pretty busy house. 
Did your brother have lots of clients? 
 

A:  Yes, he had a very good practice.  

 

Q:  Do you remember what kind of law he 
was practicing?  Did he deal mostly with 
agricultural problems or--? 
 

A:  No, everything. He had a good name  as a 
good lawyer in that two years. Those people 
that my father was dealing came to him as a lawyer also. 
 

Q:  For legal advice? 

 

A:  I reme mber we didn™t have a telephone befo
re the war. Because he was a lawyer, so he 
has to have a telephone. Very
 few people has a telephone. 
 

Q:  So he got one for the house? 

 

A: For his office. 

 

Q:  Did he get ma rried before the war? 

 

A:  No. 
 
Q:  No?  Wa s he dating anyone before the war, do you reme mber ? 

 

A:  He was too busy. 

 

Q:  Sounds like a lawyer, yeah. 
You said all this happened before the warŠhow long before 
the war, do you reme mb er?  How long did his 
practice run before the war started? 
 

A:  The two years. 

 

Q:  Just two years?  Let me  go back just a 
little bit to when both 
you and your brother were 
born. Before WWI and I™m trying to get a gras
p for where Rozwadów wa s. I™m trying to 
reme mber on the map. I™ve looked it up several times but I can™t remembe r . Was that part 

of Poland under Russian rule? 
 

A:  Austria. 

 

Q:  Austrian rule?  Okay. Did your father
 fight in the war, in Wor l d Wa r I? 
 

7
A:  He was in Russia, no. He  was in Russia four
 years. {But he was a prisoner, so he did 
fight.} But he didn™t fight. {But he was a soldier.} Yeah, they took him. He was a soldier 
because he di dn™t ha ve any choice, they t
ook him and ma ke him a soldier. Too bad I 
don™t have the pictures, he showed
 the pictures as a soldier. 
 

Q:  He had pictures of hims e l f in uniform? 

 

A:  Oh, yeah, yeah. Very nice. From 14 t o 18, he was in Russia.  

 

Q:  Did your brother--, before WWII, I know th
at Poland had a compulsory military service? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q:  Did your brother serve in the military? 

 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  No? Was there a reason for that or--? 

 

A:  I don™t know what it was. I think he didn™t have good eyes, good enough for a soldier. 

 

Q:  Can you tell me  a little b
it about when the war started, wh
at your brother was doing, what 
happened when the Germans invaded Poland? 
 

A:  What happened was known to everybody that 
the German comi ng in the town. They start 
from theŠhow you say itŠfrom the 
doctors, lawyers, businessmen--. 
 

Q:  They came for them first? 

 

A:  Yeah and everybody knows that. First thing, he
 had a sign over the hous
e. So that sign we 
had to take off.  
 

Q:  So they knew he was a lawyer? 

 

A:  Yeah and then they take out, right away th
ey take him. That™s what they did in Lvov. He 
and my sister and my younger brother left 
the house when it was 
known that the German 
come  in already in the town. 
 

Q:  Oh, so they decided to leave before they knew what the Germans would do? 

 

A:  Yeah, yeah. Then they were going, just 
walk to Lvov. You know where this stands to 
Lvov. We ll, it™s further, even with the train you 
have to go four or five hours. So it took 

them, I don™t know. My sister went and my 
younger brother with him. {Your sister, 
Clara.} 
 

Q:  They all walked to Lvov? 

8
 
A:  Yeah. How they ma nage d, I can™t tell you. It wasn™t too pleasant but
 they came  to Lvov. 
In Lvov, was already the Russians.  
 

Q: The Russians were already in Lvov? 

 

A: But the Russians were the good guys compari
ng with the Germans what they did to the 
people.  
 

Q:  Do you remember what day or how long af
ter the invasion started, the Germans ca me  t o 
Rozwadów? 
 

A: Not more than a week. 

 

Q: Not more than a week?  Do you remember 
if your brother ever talked about being 
frightened or anybody in your fa mily bei
ng frightened about what was going on in 
Germany be fore they invaded? 
 

A: No, no. Nobody knew. 

 

Q: Nobody really knew anything? 

 

A: Nobodyexpected. 

 

Q: Did your father say anyt
hing about the Germans - -? 

 
A: About the Russians, you mean? 
 

Q: No, no. About the Germans since he ma y have
 fought with them during the war, did he 
have anything to say about the Germans o
r--?  Do you remember what he thought about 
the Germans at all? 
 

A: I don™t know. Nobody talked too much about it. 

 

Q: The reason I asked is that some  people ofte
n say that their parents said that all the 
Germans we re nice people, they had known them
 before the war and that kind of a thing? 
 

A: Yeah, that they, yeah. 

 

Q: They wouldn™t do, you know, the th
ings that they were accused of? 
 

A: No, no, they wouldn™t do it. They said the same  thing. 

 

Q: So we have your brother and your sist
er and your younger brother walked, I would 
imagine several weeks, to get to Lvov?  
 

9
A: They didn™t have time, 
several weeks. I don™t know. 
 
Q: But they ma de it to Lvov some how? 

 

A: Yeah. {Maybe they got rides with people goi
ng.} Oh, yeah, yeah. It was that people that 
my father was doing business, they ha ve a
nother place on the other side in Poland. So 
they have a son and that son run away t
oo. Going, my brother me
t him on the way just 
like that. He went with a wagon and horses so
 he have them a ride. That what ___ . 
 

Q: But they didn™t plan to meet? They
 just happened to meet on the road? 
 

A: Yeah,that™sright. 

 

Q: So they went to Lvov. Do you know what they were doing there? 

 

A: In Lvov, we have friends and they have apartm
ent. So the first thing 
they have a place to 
go in till they fi nd out; they w
ill think what to do. But they were staying there for a few 
weeks. In the meanwhile, the Germans came and told us to get out. 
 

Q: From your Šfrom Roz wadów? 

 

A: From our house. So we start to go in 
the same direction. I don
™t know why they are 
because when they left, they didn™t know where they go and we didn™t know where they 

go.  
 

Q:  Oh, so they didn™t have a specific plan to 
go to Lvov?  They were ju
st running to the East? 
 

A: No, from ot her towns they run to
 Rozwadów. From Rozwadów, theyŠnobody knows 
where to go or why they go. It was just a terr
ible thing to live it through. What else you 
want to know? 
 

Q: Did you--?  Now you we re with your parents, 
right?  Wa s it just you and your parents or 
other people? 
 

A: My younger sister. 

 

Q: Your younger sister? And what™s her name  again? 

 

A: Anna. 

 

Q: Anna. 

 

A: {No, it™s Hanna.} 

 

Q: Oh,Hanna. 

 

10
A: Hanna is Yiddish. 
Q: And you all also went to 
Lvov?  Did you get there from 
rides or did you go on a train? 
 

A: We ca me  to a little town and there we find out
 that a train is going, 
the last train goes out 
for that little town. So we hea
d, I think, a ride into Lvov here. 
 

Q: When you all came to Lvov, did you meet up 
with your brother and your other brother 
and sister? 
 

A: Yeah, we met. Not right away because  we 
have to stop in another town that the train 
didn™t go exactly to Lvov.  
 

Q: You didn™t know that they were in Lvov, did you? 

 

A: No, no but through people. So there were apar
tments and even those 
people were running 
from Lvov too so they left the apartment. So 
we had an apartment. Apartment! One room.  
 

Q: One room for the four of you?  And your olde
r brother lived in a different apartment near 
you, or-?  
 

A: In the same  building. 

 

Q: In the same building? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 
Q: Can you tell me  what the Russians were doi
ng in Lvov?  We re there any restrictions on 
you as to what--? 
 
A: Don™t ask, the Russians was not--. First thing 
they take everything wh
at they saw to take. 
Because they had, they didn™t ha ve to pay. 
They went and nationalistsŠ{nationalized} 
nationalized and it was stamped, they are co
mi ng and taking whatever they want.  
 

Q: Did your brother try to start to 
work or was there anything to do? 
 

A: He was working, they gave him a job. 

 

Q: The Russians did?  

 

A: The Russians did, yeah.  

 

Q: So he was practicing as a lawyer again?  

 

A: No. He wor ked in an office. 

 

Q: Was he doing clerical work or--? 

11
 
A: I don™t know, I can™t tell you. But that, they
 di d him a big fa vor. Because if they know, 
the Russians would, a few weeks later, two or
 three weeks later, the Russians came and 
took us to Russia. If he would be hom
e, maybe he would go to Russia too.  
 

Q: But he wasn™t home when they came? 

 

A: He was working and my  sister too. 

 

Q: How long did you stay there before you 
left?  How long were they were?  Do you 
r e me mb e r ?  
 

A: Whoyoumean? 

 

Q: Before the Russians took you from Lvov? 

 

A: Just a few weeks, ma ybe two or three w
eeks or maybe months. Could be a few months, 
it™s too hard to reme mb
er all those things.  
 

Q:  Do you know what happened 
to your brother after you left? 

 

A:  No. My brother was, he had a friend, not
 a friend he knew because she was an older lady 
already but she has apartment. Some how he got
 her address and he was there, he lived 
there for a short time . He was working. Thenafter the war, I was talking to that woma n 

and she says that one evening--. They knew 
that Russians taken alre
ady the people in the 
trains, not the trai
ns, the cattle cars. 
 

Q:  Taken out the Poles? 

 

A:  Huh? 

 

Q:  Taking the Poles from--? 

 

A: The Poles also, the rich people first. Firs
t went the rich people. She says he came one 
evening and she said that some body t old him that
 they will come  for hi m. He asked her to 
give him a blanket and a pillow that he ha
s toŠhe wouldn™t sleep there that night. She 
never saw him again and nobody saw him again. 
 

Q:  Would this have been in 1939 still? 

 

A: No, this would be in ™40 or ™41. {Didn™t it
 say in that article in
 the book, didn™t it say how 
he was working though when he was in Lvov
?  He was working to help other people.} 
Yeah, in that book. {It mi ght be useful fo
r you to have that, if you can, to have it 

translated.} 
 

Q: Sure, talking about what
 he was doing in Lvov? 

12
 
A: {Yeah, before the war. I thi
nk that™s why, in fact, they had 
an individual--. Not before the 
war, during the war. I think that
™s why, in fact, he™s got that 
individual articl
e in there, I 
don™t know. I don™t remember it that
 clearly but he was working to help other people to 
get out or do different kinds offŠto save 
themselves in some way. In the process, 
some how, he was caught up.} Helped the peopl
e, he sent in food to them. {Yeah, but 
that™s what he did and it does talk about that in
 the article.} This is a ve ry nice article. {If 
you think you had it translat
ion, could you send me  a copy of the translation? }
