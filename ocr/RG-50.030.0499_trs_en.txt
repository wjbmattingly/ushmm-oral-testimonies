ZDENKO JOHN BERGL 
 September 14, 2005 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: It™s nice to see you again. 

A: Sa me  here. 

Q: Tell me  what was your name  when you were born? 

A: My name  was Zdenko Bergl. 

Q: You had no mi ddle name ?  

A: No, I did not have a mi ddle na me. I was born in 
a little c- community in Croatia, and in town 
where I was born there were only five Jewish fami lies, so we didn™t have a Jewish 

[indecipherable] per se. 
Q: Right. 
A: So we were very mu ch integrated, and to 
have any Jewish relationship we had to go in 
neighboring town where there were quite a few mo
re Jewish fa milies. So but where my father 
conducted the business, and where we lived, so, for 
all practical purposes, and 
to enroll me  in the 
school, mi ddle name  wa s not required. And my 
family was -- by that time, where I was born 
there were what you would consider today 
Reform Jews, not  very religious Jews.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Even to the -- my grandparents come from
 a different background b
ecause you see the -- the 
Yugoslavia is really a offshot of Austro-Hungarian
 Empire. So when Yugoslavia was for m as a 

country, was on the end of the first World Wa r, 
when President Wilson told to Serbia, what do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
2 
 
 
you want. And Serbia say, I like a lit
tle this, a little of 
that. So they form a Slavic nation which 
give a name  to Yugoslavia. So it happened conse
quently that people were 
living all over in the 
part of Yugoslavia that™s called Cr
oatia today. My grandfather who se
ttled there is really of them 
from Hunga rian ma ke-up. And my grandparents s
poke Hungarian at home, and parents used to 
speak Hungarian at home. So really, my bac
kground was Hungarian. And my dad, who was also 
from Hunga rian background, he was actually work
ing in neighboring town as a ma nager for a 
Jewish bigger firm, like a little wholesaler, but
 a bigger town than ours. And then become  
acquainted between my mother, who was run -- he
lping her father in the business, and my 
grandfather was getting big -- ol
der, and older. So my grandf
ather saw opportunity, he™s a good 
looking guy, he -- he ma ke the goo-goo eyes at 
my daughter, ma ybe I can hook up with him, and 
I got my right hand. And that™s how it happened, 
my hand -- my father ma rried Mom, and the -- 
start ma naging my grandfather™s business, and 
that™s how our [indecipherable] took place in 
Croatia. But the background from the both side
s, my mother and father, is Hungarian. 
Q: Uh-huh. Now, what was this 
little town where you were -- 
A: Sv. Ivan Zabno. Saint Zabno. 
Q: Saints --  

A: -- Zabno is a -- is a really -- 
is no translation for it, there™s 
just wa -- you know, just one -- 
Q: Is that near Zagreb? 

A: This is approxima tely north from Zagreb, 14 miles. 

Q: Was that far at that time? 

A: No, it was not the ti -- all th
e [indecipherable] we had the trai
n communication to Za greb. We  
didn™t use the buses at that time
, the buses become  popular much later. But my grandfather was 
doing quite well, and so ma  -- and my mothers, 
you know, my mother come
s from a family of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
3 
 
 
three br others and four gi rls, so it was a very pr
olific family, and they were each one in his own 
way, very situ -- well situated. But in our town 
that I was born and where my fa mily took root, 
only two girls stayed. The rest of
 them ma rried and moved on. Only 
one sister left, that ma rry a 
doctor, who was a Czech, and he was Gentile. Matter 
of fact, he studied to be a priest, and she 
married him, and -- and my mother, 
who took care of the grandparents. 
Q: Uh-huh. So the -- were your grandparent
s living in the same
 town with you? 
A: My -- were living in the same  town, in the same house. 

Q: In the same  house. 

A: In the same  house. But you know, as we prosper, 
then they build one, o -- extra house, or they 
had their own. But build -- that  Mother was really
 caretaker for my grandparents as they were 
aging. She was never get it from he r brot
hers and sisters to 
take care of it -- 
Q: Okay. 

A: -- but that™s a story a-all by its
elf, and if you wishing to go into 
it, I will explain it to you what 
happened. Because one of my mother™s brothers 
become  a [indecipherable] Jewish in Croatia 
[indecipherable] big buck. And he wa
s really the patriarch of the 
family because with his money 
[indecipherable] the power, and he
 -- when my fat her -- see, my
 father was a visionary. He 
wanted to get hell out of Europe in 1936. And 
my uncle, my mother™s brother says, you know, I-I 
would prefer if you would take
 care of the folks and I™ll te
ll you what I™m going to do. When 
they die, I™m going to buy out all my brothers and 
sisters, and everything 
is going to be yours. So 
my father thought that™s a good deal
, let™s do it now, but let™s go to
 America. But it never worked 
out. 

Q: It didn™t work out. 

A: But finally at a certain 
point, he wish come  true.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Q: Right, right. Now, you didn™
t tell us your birthdate. 
A: I was born on August 23
rd
, 1929. And I was the third try of my parents to have a child. 
Q: The third try. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you™re the only child. 

A: I would -- no, after me  one more, but see, we 
-- we were living in such a -- I wouldn™t say 
uncivilized -- a -- a little comm
unity that didn™t have a hospita
l back up. That ma  -- all of my 
brothers were premature. Before me  and afte
r me, so they die very
 shortly after birth. 
Q: I see. 

A: The only guy who wa s mean e
nough to stick around was me .  
Q: Was you. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So that must have been difficult for your parents. 
A: Yeah, was very difficult for my parents, yes.  
Q: Right. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you, as you were growing up, experience 
that, that you -- you realized that -- 
A: I -- I think as I was growing up I took advant
age of it, because you know, I was the only one 
and I rode it for all it™s worth. 

Q: I see. We re you spoiled? 

A: Oh. That™s a understateme nt. 

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
5 
 
 
A: Yes. From all sides. Because my mother™ssi st er, which wa s ma rried in -- in Zagr eb to 
attorney, she didn™t -- they didn™
t have any kids. So she really
 dir-directed all her attention 
towards me , from day I was born, and as the hi
story developed, when she finally lost her 
husband in Italy, I brought her to 
America and she lived in my hous
e til she died. Sh -- but Mom 
went before, we had to take her to the old age home  --  

Q: Really? 

A: -- because we couldn™t handle it at home, whi c
h I took care of her til she died. It was kind of 
payoff -- payoff back time. And I-I was delight ed to have an opportunity, because she was to me  

like a second mother.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know, anything I couldn™t get from my
 folks, I was playing like a fiddle. 
Q: Right. 

A: I know where to turn, and she 
did it. Especially when I was 
growing up in Italy, and going to 
the faculty and so on, and I start dati
ng, they saying she financed everything. 
Q: She financed everything? 

A: Everything. 

Q: Really? 

A: So I -- so did you -- I don™t have
 to tell you how delighted I was 
when I was able to take care 
of her til she died. 

Q: Right, oh absolutely.  

A: And she knew it. 

Q: So before the war, you lived in Croatia. 

A: My -- my  p -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Q: A pr-pretty comfortable life. 
A: My grandfather, he started w
ith a little ma  -- grocery store. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He was a grocer before he moved there. See,
 the hard time s, they didn™t have that much 
grocery. And he was like a [indecipherable], my
 grandfather. He figur
e out, this is little 
community, they don™t have a grocer
y store, I think we can prosper 
here. So it didn™t take very 
much mone y, he came over there and he opened his 
grocery store, and that was the first one in 
the town. The most [inde cipherable]
 whatever is like a supply fr
om home t hat used to go the 
town and bring few grocery, and people -- farmer used to know where to go. This was really 

legitimate grocery store. And then he was diversif
ied, become  bigger [indeciphe
rable] little bit of 
dry goods [indecipherable] then he 
was taking care of baker, we 
bring a [indecipherable] stores, 
we would sell a bread. And we was prosperi
ng. And that™s how they, you know, he was doing 

better and better. Family really took off when 
my  grandmother play Austro-Hungarian lottery. 
And she won 250,000 florins, which my grandfathe
r never knew that sh
e bought, because he was 
really a dominant figure, he would never allow pl
ay lottery. And then wh
en they open the brick 
factory and that really took off. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They we really become  m
oney -- richest people in town. 
Q: In that  town -- 

A: In town, in -- 

Q: -- in [indecipherable] 

A: -- bat -- fi ve Jewish family. In five Jewish fam
ily, we we re controlling the town. I hate to tell 
you that. Our friend Most ar, which still lives there,
 he had a flour mill. Then we had a other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
7 
 
 
Jewish fa mily who was a general ma nager of this fl our mill. And then we had a pharmacist, who 
was the other guy who was taking care of. And then
 finally wa s -- oh, the guy here that -- bar and 
a beer joint, and entertainment ha
ll. The town didn™t have a -- like 
theater. When used to come  a 
roving circus in town or -- or -- 
or silent movie in town, that hall was where was showing it. So 
really, there™s five Jewish fa mily were the key fam
ily in town. At that time 
they didn™t feel very 
anti-Semitic because ther e™s a close relations
hip with the community. Community was quite 
poor, so mo st of the business conducted was on cr
edit, and all those Jews
 extended credit to the 
farmer, like the fl our mill that  would pay more af
ter they got the grain collected, they sold it. 
And then in carry -- [indeciphera
ble] of the books, so was -- ever
ything was going fine. But later 
on we found out it was not enough, and the Nazi
s come  in, it was only a front for their 
convenience. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: People that we didn™t expect 
to be in our -- our corner, th
ey come . And the people that we 
counted on, they disappointed us.  

Q: Right. So -- 

A: But yo -- I™m going -- I don™t want to 
go ahead of you in chronological order. 
Q: It™s all right, I can always
 -- I can always come  back. 
A: Yeah, you can just go ahead, stop me  at any time.  

Q: Right. How big a to
wn was this, about ? 
A: Okay, we had a city hall in our town, a
nd town which in itself has about 3,000 population. 
But the community, or the commune where they
 will call it, had obtain ot her off shops -- 
Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
8 
 
 
A: -- that used to belong to all that. So a
ll together you would tell by the 20,000 people belonged 
to the commune. 
Q: So that™s big enough to 
support all these businesses -- 
A: Oh yes -- 

Q: -- cause the small, little town couldn™t do it. 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we ha
d the big -- like, for example, lots of stock. 
So once a month was the stock ma rket where the 
butchers used to come  by, all the stock what 
they need.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Then farmer will bring it there, and that™s 
where they do it. They -- they once a month a big 
ma rket. The -- the vendor with th
e tent come  in the town to -- you know, to supplement thing 
where the town didn™t have. 

Q: Right. 
A: But did they wanted to go to a bigger town, 
the be -- he -- the two of
 them, one was about 15 
miles away, the other 25 miles away. But was stil
l quite far away for a guy who was comi ng with 
horse and buggy. 
Q: Yeah, sure. What was your father™s name ?  

A: Nandor Bergl. Nandor, N-a-n-d-o-r. 

Q: Right. And your mot her™s name? 

A: Ilonka. 

Q: So tell me  about them as people as you were
 you growing up, what was your relationship with 
your father and your mot her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
9 
 
 
A: Ma -- ba -- my father was extremely good l
ooking guy, and my mother was extremely jealous 
woma n. And my father being -- fo
r the business is always trave
ling all over, and wa -- and 
wome n loved him, and that™s exactly didn™t go big 
time with my mother. Now, we ne ver used to 
go to Zagreb, which is the capital
 of Croatia. My uncle, who was ma
rried to that aunt of mi ne 
that -- I di -- he was a big pra
nkster, he was attorney. Corporat
e attorney, brilliant . A matter of 
fact, he was representing
 my mother wealthy brother in a c
ourse against German ag -- during the 
Hitler, in 1936. This wealthy uncle
 of mi ne, he had -- he was a -- he had a dealership for Agrell 
car factory for all Yugoslavia. And then so
me  mi sunderstanding happened, and the German 
company sued him in international court. And 
my -- this attorney -- brother-in-law defended 

brother-in-law, and he won agains
t the Nazis, in Vienna. But that
™s -- but this guy, this attorney, 
whenever my father will come  to Za greb for bus
iness, and you know how my mother was wildly 
jealous. He would go put a silk st
ocking in his shoes, or a note. One time he put a -- he had had 
two theater tickets in his pocket, because he 
know when my mother come home she™s going to 
go through the pocket to clean them, and they us
ed to luftig, you know what I -- know what 

mean luftig? Air it --  

Q: Air it out. 

A: -- air the clothes before you put
 the clothes in -- she™s going to
 come  with the ticket. So she 
come s this ticket, and my dad, ask him, were you in
 theater in Zagr
eb?  He says no, he says, I was 
working til six o™clock in the evening, I was ha
ppy to eat and I slept by 
your sister, and took a 
train in the morning. You sure you didn™t go no theat
er?  She said, you got two 
tickets there. Said, 
I was not in theater there. My mother hired detect
ive to go ahead with the picture of my father, to 

go around to see if people saw him with a woma
n in theater. That™s how far she went. 
Q: So when did you find that out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
10 
 
 
A: I found it out when I was alrea
dy there, because don™t forget the 
I -- when I left Croatia, I was 
almost Bar Mitvah™d, 12 and a half years old. 
Q: Right. 

A: So this bickering, I was laughing, was very 
funny, because they -- didn™t take him long to 

discover th-that my uncle pulled the trick. 

Q: Right. 

A: And even after my mother become aware that 
he™s a prankster, he still pulled trick on and he 
got away with it. Because my mo
ther never trusted him, you know? 
Q: Ne -- fa -- your mother never trusted -- 

A: Ne -- ne -- ne -- 

Q: -- your father. 

A: Never. And he was really basically a very fa
ithful guy. When we were in immi gration in Italy, 
and the woma n who offered us a villa, and took 
us in, you know [indecipherable] to be their 
tenant, and I™m not talking little ho
le, I mean talking Italian villa, 
and they give us a room, and a 
kitchen, and it™s a long story, and we
 -- on the end they gi -- bor -- 
when they have to go in the 
hiding when the Nazi come  in, th
ey tell you, she give us cash, so we can go in the hiding. But it 
was the woma n™s birthday, so my fa ther goes to 
kiss her, wish her happy birthday, who walks in 
is my mother. And he say, I was wishing happy bi
rthday. So my father [indecipherable]. Then 
she went bidi -- the shoes were very hard to ge
t during the war, so we wearing Italian, sh -- wood 
shoes called zoccoli. So she had th -- and 
you know how noisy you are when you™re wa lking on 
your ma rble with the zoccoli, you think the army
 is going through. She had 
the rubber -- a rubber 
sole put on it so she can tiptoe 
[indecipherable] so he can not h
ear it. It was so comi c it™s 
unbelievable.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
11 
 
 
Q: But it wasn™t funny for them. 
A: No, it was not -- it was not funny for them, it 
was not funny for my da -- but she -- Mother 
could not help. 

Q: Yeah. But see -- 

A: Even when we come  over here, he could not help. 

Q: Right. 

A: So it become a more j
oke than a serious threat. 

Q: Right. 

A: But basically they 
were wonderful life. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because my father was an excellent busine
ssman, but wa s very lousy bookkeeper, and that™s 
where my mother come in. 

Q: So she was a ba -- 
A: My mother was a bookkeeper, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my mother took a schooling and so -- 
so she was able to go give him a back-up 
[indecipherable] that needed especially --

Q: When you were growing up, were you 
close with both of your parents? 
A: I was close with my parents, and with this 
sister™s son -- you know, th

same  town?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
12 
 
 
A: They had a b-boy same  age, and we were like 
-- like glue together 
when is -- we were 
growing up.

is the sister of your mother? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. She ra -- her name was Emma  Chopik, she was --  

Q: Emma  Chopik. 

A: -- an-and he was -- he was a doctor in 
the town. He is the 
guy who deliver me . 
Q: I see. I see. 

A: My mother™s -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- sister husband. He was a -- 

Q: And the -- the one who is the lawyer in -- 

A: She live in Zagreb. 

Q: And is this a -- is this 
the husband of another si -- anot
her sister of your mother -- 
A: No, no, n -- 

Q: -- or is she a bru -- is -- 

A: He™s -- Ruza is the other sister of my mother
. See, really, my mother
 had a -- three brothers. 
One was killed in the first World War, in
 the German ar my, fighting for Austria. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And the other, it was killed by the Nazis be
cause he ma rry a Gentile woma n, he thought it™s 
gonna save him, and he couldn™t. And the third 
brother, this very w
ealthy guy, he came to New 
York, he -- he -- he had a lots of mo ney in Switz
erland, but the war it came , so then he come  to 
Italy with the rest of us, but when you come  to
 the Italian pa rt I w
ill explain it to you what 
happened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
13 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And -- and then he come  to Ne w York, he still
 had a lots of money, but he forgot that for 
America he was a little fish. In Europe was a bi
g fish. Here was nothing. And he went in oil 
business in Atlanta, Georgia, and he 
lost his butt. Quic
k. I™m talking now 1951. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Just like everything 
he touched in Europe turning in to
 gold, everything he touched in 
America went sour.  

Q: Oh, that™s interesting. So when you™re
 growing up -- this is
 before the war -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- between 1929, and -- 

A: And 1941.

ope that were taking Je
ws, Yugoslavia and Italy. 
Yugoslavia because they thought that nothi ng is 
going to happen, and Italy done it because some  

-- for some  Viennese Jews, especially I would ca
ll it aristocrat, professor, doctor and genius, 
Yugoslavia is not very appealing. 
Italy was much more appealing.  
Q: Right. 

A: Now, I™m sure you heard, you know, the part 
that my wi fe explained it to you, and you know 
with the fi -- how Italy opened the border. 
Mussolini -- it was Mussolini, I want you to 
emphasize that, who was under pressure of Hitle
r nonstop to do some thing about the Je ws, he 
kept putting him off. Because from day Mussolini
 enter in the -- in power, in October of 1928, 
the l -- his liberation in Grand 
Sasso by Colonel Scorcese, Ge rman paratroopers, and then whisk 

him back to Germany. Nobody touched a J-Jew in It
alia, not a single Jew wa
s killed. They put a 
pressure on them, they made their life mi serabl
e, but was not life thr
eatening, because Mussolini 
was put in power by Jews. We ll lots of Italian Jewi
sh aristocr ats, they were Fascists when he 
come  in power. People don™t know that. So he 
was -- he felt obliged to them, like bonhommes, 

and all these Jews were still you have in Italy pe
rpetuate in the dynasty in their family, but he 
was under pressure, and he was passi
ng the racial law to pacify --

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Because original Mussolini, he had the agre
ement with Schuschnigg th
at if Hitler attack 
Austria, he is going to defend Austria. And he™s
 a chick -- hit -- and Mussolini chickened out. He 
figured, hey, that guys is stronge
r, I™m not going to go with my head against the wall. And they 
got involved in this thing. But that got Nazi in 
the war, it concern us as a Jewish, as a salvation. 
If you notice, every Jew entering that passport It
aly didn't stamp it. He didn™t want any record 

how ma ny J e w he let in Italy. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Like when my wife was in the concentration 
camp, this was like -- first [indecipherable] to go 
help him that some Jews are th -- I have a 
concentration camp. But this concentration in 

Ferramonti di Tarsia was a joke. Now, I have a 
fr iend who will live in Tars
ia, and he  was telling 
me  story, and I unfortunately don™t have his pict
ure, Italian guard around 
there, there was little 
booth where they stayed and guard, but they couldn™
t stay there because was -- the little gr ocery 
store, with the cigarettes and the 
fruit and the candy. So even if it™s 
raining, they just stay in front 
of booths, they™re doing business with the people in
 the camp . So you come  to the fe nce, and you 
tell the -- ah, Jojo, come  here. He say, 
what you need?  Two pack of cigarette.  
Q: Yeah, that was before -- 

A: So, you know. And e ven in the 
life in the camp in itself is mu
ch completely different life 
because they, you know, nobody worry about the life. 
There were so ma ny engineers, doctors, 
like Evie told you, when she hurts her finger, everybody come running. That was cream de la 

cream of Vi enna, mostly Vienna, in [indecipher
able]. Now -- now I™m going back to Yugoslavia 

and Croatia. Croatia didn™t have
 an organized Jewish community 
when j -- Viennese Jews start 
comi ng Croatia. So what the Croatian community in
 its -- in itself done -- because you have to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
18 
 
 
reme mber, whole Yugoslavia had 60,000 Jews. That 
the more Jews in one little town in Poland, 
the whole damn country of Croatia had -- yugo -- 
not Croatia, Yugoslavia. Now, Croatia would 
have approximately 12,000 Jews, mo re or less. So w
ealthy Jews in Croatia, being they were not 
organized, each one took a fa mily in the house for boarding and sleeping. 

Q: From -- from -- 

A: From Vienna. 

Q: From Vienna. 

A: Yeah. I™m talking 1938 - ™39. Now mi ne uncle 
[indecipherable] in business, and he couldn™t 
babysit or take care of the people in the house. 
He took a little hotel 
in Zagreb called Hotel 
Astoria, and -- and there were 22 rooms, and he 
put 22 Jewish fa mily in that hotel for duration, 
food and everything included. 

Q: Really? 

A: On his own, without anythi
ng to do with the community. 
What those poor people didn™t 
realize, that this hotel was ta
ken lease in 1939, and the [indeciphera
ble] lasted only 
til Easter of 
1941, they had to run again. So the people w
ho choose Italy, they ma de a better choice. 
Q: Right.  

A: I just want to tell you -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- a mechanic behind the Croatian Jews help 
the Viennese Jews. Some  Viennese Jews ma de it 
to Belgrade . Now Belgrade Serbia had a much 
bi gger Jewish community. And Serbian people as 

a overall, were less anti-Semitic -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
19 
 
 
A: -- because King Alexander was a big frie
nd of Jews. You -- you -- you -- I™m sure you know 
who I am talking about. King 
of Serbia, of Yugoslavia. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And King Staff, you know, Dr. Alka
li and all these mi nister were mostly Jewish. So the Jews 
had it pretty darn good from the day that Y
ugoslavia -- inception of 
Yugos lavia, til the 
Yugoslavia fell apart in
 the whole country. 
Q: So you didn™t grow up with the feelings of being Jewish and there be ing anti-Semitism in 

Croatia? 

A: I -- I -- I -- I br ought up in th
is little community that I know that was anti-Semitism because 
you always had -- you ha ve it every place. If you don™
t have a community that™s anti-Se mitic -- I 
mean, I can see -- I felt it which is there, 
but not to the extent to be threatened.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: A ma tter of fact, the kids I we
nt to the school is right now one 
of them is a surgeon who just 
retired in Zagreb, Croatia, every time I go over 
there I™m his houseguest. I mean, we grew up 
together, we hang her up all the time . And-- and other guy wa s a son of the post officer 

manager. He™s living in Opatia in 
-- in Croatia, also. I™m in -- with him in touch all the time. So I 
keep in touch with few of them that they rema
in our friend, even that we couldn™t -- but when 

they came -- when we couldn™t during the war. Bu
t when we come  to run, the saddest part it is -- 
and I™m know that you™ll be interested in this, 
when the Nazi come  in, they confiscated our 
property, they come  in April, by na -- by June 
all our property gone, groc
ery store, factory and 
all that. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
20 
 
 
A: They send so-called supervisor 
to run -- they were totally inept.
 I me a n, to -- one -- they sold 
what was on stock, they were i -- 
in heap of trouble. But to puni
sh my father, first they send him 
on a false labor in a old orchards. They had the bi
g orchard with 4,000 trees of fruits. So all town 
could see the Jews is comi ng over there, cleaning th
e veets and all that. And when this got old -- 
and my mother was working with him, too -- then 
took my father to the --
 ready to ship into 
concentration camp. And they took him to Zagreb 
where -- to be shipped to the infamous camp 
of Jasenovac, okay?  But my aunt, married to atto
rney in Zagreb, she and the guy -- when she was 
going to the [indecipherable] who wa
s th -- at that time she didn't re
alize, he was a fifth column, 
that™s a -- you know wha t ™s a 
fifth ca -- the -- the German Nazi
 underground all over Europe. She 
didn™t know that, but he was [indeci
pherable]. And when Hitler took over, and the Nazi state of 
Croatia was created, she seeing hi s picture that he
 become  police commissioner. So she call him. 
His name  was Medwid. And he told Medwid, 
listen, what the hell ha
ppen, I thought that you 
love us. He said, I still love you, 
but that™s [indecipherable] my job 
for me . I -- I believe in a free 
Croatia. I didn™t believe the Serb
 that should dominate [indeciphera
ble] okay then, I don™t want 
to talk politics, I have a probl
em. My brother-in-law is in Zb
ore where they put the -- sending 
people. Said, don™t worry, I take car
e of it. So he say okay, tomorrow morning he is going to be 
out, have his fa mily from Zabno, from my home t o
wn come , I™m gonna give them papers so they 
can go in there to Italian border, and then cl
andestine over the mountain crossing with Italy, you 
couldn™t just legally cross to It
aly, because that™s already ™41. D
on™t forget, Evie come  with the 
passport in 1938 -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- I coul dn™t do that. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
21 
 
 
A: That™s already different ballgame . 
Q: We ™re going to have to stop the ta
pe, I™m afraid. We ™ll continue this. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Zdenko, I -- I understand that y-your fa mily 
was so conscious of what was going on that you 
had a family boycott of all German goods, is that right? 
A: Yes, yes. We started alrea
dy doing it in 1938, and I was very upset because I -- there™s some  -
- even Berkly German toys, fantastic toys, I mean 
they™re the best toys on 
eur -- i -- on European 
ma rket. Everything disappeared in 1938. I used to lik
e to have a little lead
 soldiers, I mean the 
whole army, in trucks and all the stuff. It was 
not allowed in our hou -- any part to our fa mily, 
not even family that was bringing me  toys. So th
e -- we did -- we were very much aware what 
was going on. Unfortunately, didn™t do 
nothing about it, they still ke
pt s-same  -- do business in -- 
in Yugoslavia, but we knew what was going on.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Did this ma ke you feel 
bad as a kid, or did you understand it? 
A: It ma de me  feel bad to the point because we™ll --
 my dad, especially, he 
was very fearful, he -- 
he always wanted to get out of it for so -- 
like I told you before. So I™ve become  very 
uncomfortable because my dad could not expand 
his business, he was holding back, while his 
brother-in-law, my mother™s wea
lthy brother, he was increasing it. Now, when it was time to go 
ahead and run, and pick our ma rble and go, he star
ted building a f -- mill, steel mill, steel, now 
listen. One the biggest  steel mill that™s today exis
ts in Croatia, my unc
le start building in 1938. 
Insane, absolutely insane, because he was so commi -- he felt like a bi g Croat. 

Q: So he thought he needed three mills? 

A: Yeah, he -- yeah, he  really thought nothing is going to happen, people will appr eciate, he was 

always big patriot. You me  -- my uncle by self
, supported Catholic church in my hometown. I 
mean, priests that he needed money for new roof
 didn™t go to -- to Zagreb
 talk to bishop. He 
talking what, to guys from our home town, he got th
e damn l-lumber yard, and a st -- a -- a brick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
23 
 
 
factory, and they™re ma king a roof 
covers and all that, the clay til
e. Why am I gonna go to bishop 
when I got here [indecipherable] or go to Za
greb, next time  come  to town, and I got 
[indecipherable] talk to him.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I mean, when they used to come  bless the ho
me for the Christian holi
days, I mean, the priest 
went first to five Jewish houses
. He collected more money than whole the rest of town. So you 
see how [indecipherable] integr
ated with this community. 
Q: So there wasn™t a sense, even though ever
ybody knew that there was a difference in people™s 
religious orientation -- 

A: Yeah, no, you -- no -- it was not really a th
reat or a feel of 
a strong anti-Semitism.  
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: We  only realized how much was  fake to so
me extent, when we had to finally leave our 
home town like I told you before
 because my father was taken to go to the camp, and we had to 
follow him when the news come  that we are ready to get hell out of there, nobody come  to the 

street to say good-bye. There™s only 
one fa mily, close to the railroad 
station, that tell us well, if 
you have to leave, come  over, we want to give 
you dinner before you go on the train. But the rest 
of the town was hiding behind the curtain. And th
e sooner we got over ther
e, like vultures they 
cleaned up the house mu ch as they can. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did Germans come in
to your little town in 1941? 
A: The German come  i n oy -- war started Easterweekend of ™41, the Germans actually -- in vel -

- their physical presence wa
s there 14 days later. 
Q: So they really were physically present. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
24 
 
 
A: Yeah, we did -- we did tro -- they come  to 
our store. My father wa
s still running his grocery 
store, and they were so starved fo
r fine toiletry, like fine soap, smelly soap and stuff, they bought 
everything. They give us the German ma rks.  
Q: We re you frightened when you saw these German soldiers? 

A: Yes, yes, they were very imposing, very. 

Q: They were imposing. 

A: Because th -- you coul d notice -- I didn™t see ess -- S.S. troopers, I saw only soldiers. 

Q: Right. 

A: So they already scaring hell ou
t of me . But when you see a really 
S.S. trooper, i-it™s ri -- it 
looks to me  like a liquidation squads, with the 
black uniform, with the 
skullcaps, the ma rching 
group. They were so programmed, like the robotics
 today that you see. It™s amazing. I mean, I 
think they invented the roboticbefore their time . I mean, it is funny. A -- later on when we were 

already liberated, I used to ma ke
 fun of the damn S.S. because
 it™s so funny. One of them is 
comi ng, and you™re hop, hop [indecipherable] hop, and everybody jump like a bunch of yoyos. I 

mean, I can see that later on when I was serv
ing American army, I was laughing, said boy this 
German offi cer would die if he would come  over 
here. He would try to run American army the 
way do that. But they were very [indecipherable]. 
Never question a order. I me an, they come  in 
the town, they say -- I saw in It
aly, after Italy capitulated, and Ge
rman took over, and then when 
they kill two German, the partisan, they took every 
ma n they got hold of and they hang it -- them 
up on the trees, they will look like Christma s deco
ration. So -- but that™s a different chapter. 
Q: So when -- when -- when you saw ess -- S.S. came  to your town? 

A: S.S. come to town like a month later. When -- when the Croatian government was formed, the 

Nazi Croatia -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
25 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- under Ante Pavelic, then the S.S.
 is come  in town as recruiter. 
Q: Recruiting Croatians? 

A: Re -- for -- recruiting Croatia
n for the Croatian Nazi army. 
Q: They get a lot of people from your  town? 

A: No, they didn™t get very ma ny people from my town. 

Q: They didn™t? 

A: No, no, no, they didn™t get any place very
 ma ny people, because ma ny people were aware 
what was going on because when you volunteer for 
the job, they know Rus sian front wa s next 
direction. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So they were already aware that the ww-ar is
 spreading and all that. 
You know, they were not 
sitting over there and playing soldiers -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- they know there™s going to
 be some thing else behind it. 
Q: How mu ch were your newspapers giving you 
information about what was happening to Jews 
in Germany?  I mean, by ™
41, there are no exter -- 

A: Our newspaper give us a 
blow by blow descriptions. 
Q: So you knew how anti-Semitic these Germans were. 

A: We  know exactly what was happen, we couldn™
t -- we couldn™t believ
e that Roosevelt in 
Washington was sitting on his 
finger, and couldn™t understand wh
at was going on. We c ouldn™t -
- it™s absolutely mi nd-boggling. The European pr
ess, of the country not
 occupied yet by the 
Nazis, and I™m talking about -- if you™re talking 
™41, at that time you still had the French, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
26 
 
 
was part free, part [indeci
pherable], you had the Belgia
n, Luxembourg, Holland, Sweden, 
particularly northern Baltic country, they know 
what was going. But Baltic country was always 
pro-Nazi. Even without occupation. 
The -- the Nazi influence stop in
 fil -- Finland and up there, 
way up north. But Norway and -- and -- and -- a
nd -- and -- a-and Sweden, they were always 
Nazi oriented. Now, wha t  concerned the whole Eu
rope, in the countries th
at were not occupy yet 
-- you know, Poland was already gone, Austria wa s 
already gone, so th -- but that ma ke no 
difference what people felt there, because 
they already fell under the Nazi boot. 
Q: Right, because a month after -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- they go into Yugoslavia, they™re in western Europe. 

A: That™s right. But see, what happened in Y
ugoslavia, when -- when the Nazi vic -- wanted 
Yugoslavia to join the no
n-aggression pact, and sign this thing 
that they would fall in line with 
the Fascist Italy and Germany, it happen [indeciph
erable]. See, King Alexander was dead, now 
his brother Pa ul, who was regent, because 
Alexander™s son Petar was too young, was only 14 
years old, so his Uncle Pa ul was the allegiance 
-- running the governme nt, he signed that pact 
with the Nazis. But Serbian peopl
e revolted, and they hi -- th-th- 
then there was demonstration in 
Belgrade says, better war than pact, ﬁBolje rat nego pakt.ﬂ That™s in Serbian. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Better war than pact with N
azis. Next morning -- that was 
Saturday evening, next morning 
Belgrade was bombarde d, they flatten it. And that
™s end of Serbian war -- 
a-and it didn™t take 
him long to -- Nazi to go over, es
pecially northern part of Yugos
lavia because they -- there™s so 
many infiltrated Nazi in different -- di fferent units, 
so it was just -- it™s a 
joke, they just  ma rched 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
27 
 
 
through it. Sl ovenia gi ve them a little more re
sist ance, but Croa tia di d not give them any 
resistance, no. 
Q: Right. When your father is 
ta -- he™s doing first forced labor in your own vineyards? 

A: In the vineyards, yes. 

Q: Right. But then he™s going to be sent 
to Zagreb to go to a concentration camp?  
A: To Jasenovac. 

Q: To Jasenovac? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And that™s when he™s -- 

A: We were able to get him out. 

Q: Right. Were you scared? 

A: You bet. 

Q: As a kid? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Scared to death. 

A: Yeah. We didn™t know -- we di
dn™t know of my aunt™s clout in Zagreb with the Nazis, 
because later when the same  guy helped to have whole fa mily out. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. We  never know what happened to him, 
by the way. I think the partisans kill him at a 
certain point. Tito. But we didn™t know exactly 
when. They caught up with him, but we don™t 
know where. But he a bi -- eve -- be -- gradua
lly, systematically all 
the family, except the 
younger brother, is split on the Adri
atic coast, he was ma rried to 
the gen -- he could get out too, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
28 
 
 
but she was convinced that she ca
n save him, and he didn't want to leave his wife. Fantastic 
huma n being. He had plenty opportunity. Because  he
 -- duri -- Split was in
 the Italian domain. 
Q: Right. 
A: And he -- you know, he was able to come  to vi
 -- when we were in hiding, he took Italian, he 
gave him the [indecipherable]. This is passing 
docume nt through all the borders. And he come  
visit us in the hiding. And he brought us
 present and food fr
om [indecipherable] 
Q: And then went back. 

A: -- and went back. But when -- he didn™t rea
lize that one, the Italian copulat -- capitulated on 
September 23
rd
 of 1943. 
Q: Right. 

A: The picnic was over. I mea
n, [indecipherable] we were conf
ined -- when leet -- when we 
arrived in Italy, over the border, you unders
tand, first we were in hiding, in u --  
Q: Explain that. Let™s go -- let™s go back. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: When do you go into hi
ding?  Your father -- 
A: Okay, let me  explain you. 

Q: Okay. 

A: After we got those docume nt to get my father out of the camp -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we went to the border town ca-called Kra
ljevica. That™s was Italian zone of occupation. 
Now, Italy had the two zone of occupation. I want
 go slow to try to give you the picture. One 
zone they consider occupation zone. When you 
were in occupation zone, you were not safe, 
because you -- the Croa tian Nazis, a
nd Italian occupation forces together. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
29 
 
 
Q: And is that the north? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: The north tri -- 

A: -- I™m talking about north. O-Over th
ere covers Opatia, Fume , Trieste -- 
Q: Right. 

A: That zone. And in that zone, you was always 
in danger if they catch you, the Nazi -- the 

Italiame nt -- the Italian Fa sc
ists would turn you over back -- they would not harm you, they 
would give you back to 
the Croatian Nazis. 
Q: Croatia, right. 

A: When you enter to the jo
int Italian an-annexed to Ital
y, like Ljubljana, you know, they 
consider part of Italy, you have it ma de. So our jo
b, after they fi nally get in a s-s --  half safety 
zone, an occupied zone, to get to annexed zone
, this was a big thr -- because we know, if we 
reach Ljubljana, we are fr ee. And we ma nage ag
ain, with the he lp of a -- how would you call it, 
of city ma na ger of a little community by Opa
tia, you know, in the northern -- little commun -- 
ma ybe 1200 population. My father become  friend w
ith him, he know that we are in hiding, he 
said listen, I will need a paper to
 de clare us that we are resi de nt
 of Grobnik and we have to go to 
business to Ljubljana because we
 have to catch a bus. And give us some  name s f -- cock and 
bull, whatever you want to ma ke. 
And he give us temporary pass w
ith all this stamps and what y 
-- and we caught the bus from spl 
-- Rijeka, that is ri
ght of Opatia, to Ljubljana. We  pass few 
checkpoint. Croatia Nazis and Italia
n. Once we enter in Ljubljana, 
we went directly to Italian 
authority said hey, we are here, the Jews from Cr
oatia, we want to apply for confinement in Italy. 
That™s ag -- very good. Now here come  the new in
formation that fo -- Evie didn™t tell you. She 
said they got a subsidy. Italian [i
ndecipherable] to all th
e Jews that didn™t have nothing, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
30 
 
 
had to eat. And they just have them all in 
camp, because there were whole bunch of them, and 
the only known ca mp wa s Ferramonti di Tarsia. Di
dn™t have any other camps. Had to give them 
livelihood. Every head of the fa mily got a five lira
 a day, wife got three lira a day, for each kids, 
two lira a day. So if you add it 
up, it was not enough for a fantas
tic life, but you would not be 
hungry. To give you idea how [indecipherable] to 
a real -- what, over 300 lira some thing. A rent 
would cost you 120 lira a month, approxima tely in th
e little communities. The rest of it for your 
food. So they give you e
nough money to survive. 
Q: Right. 

A: So when we arrived in Ljubljana, we apply for subsidy. Til my
 uncle Rich Rada, til he find 
out where we were. Once he find out we were -- 
he was running too, because he was in Italy, in 
Aosta.  

Q: In Aosta? 

A: Aosta -- 
Q: Aosta, uh-huh. 
A: Aosta, province of Aost
a. That™s northern Italy. 
Q: Northern Ital y. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he didn't have no problem go to Switzerland because he come  to the border, sa y here, my 

s -- account in Swiss bank so and so, and Swi
ss say welcome Mr. Rada. Now for rest of us a 
different story. But when he -- once he becomi ng -- 
got into safety -- and even before, when we 
were confined in Modena -- we were sent to 
Modena, by the way, which -- 
this a breadbasket of 
Italy. The most fantastic cuisine if you can ever
 dream. And t hen we [indecipherable] by this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
31 
 
 
Italian family like I me ntioned befo
re that helped us eventually, 
we even -- Italian -- they -- you 
know, this was the war. So even Italian when they
 want to go over there and get a supply for the 
winter, they have to go city hall,
 get a permission to buy a pig. 
They™ll have a pig, or the cow, 
have it butchered, and then they will take it hom
e, and they will [i ndeci pherable] and refr iger ate 
it -- because they didn™t have a refrigerator in 
every house, but there were lockers that you could 
rent at -- to st ore the -- fre-

A: She thought that I would want a steak, or a 
wienerschnitzel, some thing. I knew better, I knew 
it was not available, it was in wartime. But I 
saw -- when you enter a re
staurant and you start 
smelling from garlic three blocks away, 
I know that they would have some thing --

odd, but y -- did you have your own little suitcase? 
A: Yes, I did have my own suitcase. 
Q: Yes.

A: It was -- my junk was much
 heavier than my clothes. 
Q: I bet it wa s. Now, I gather your parents must ha
ve left o -- just about
 everything in the house. 
A: My -- we left everything. We  had some  frie
nd of my mother that 
she couldn™t find jewelry. 
She said the Nazi came, took it away. People that 
we really trusted. Now, what mi ne father did 
that -- when he noticed the Nazi was comi ng, he we
nt in the baseme nt of our house. We had -- in 
this town by the river is the factory, we had the three homes. 
Q: Mm-hm. Three homes? 

A: Three home s, yes. 

Q: In this little town? 

A: Yeah. All of them built in three years or four before the war. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: My father knocked it down, and build becaus
e original house where my  fa -- grandfather 
started the business was 95 years old by time -- that
 time , so he knocked it down the same  spot, 
in two. First he knocks down the old grocery stor
e. So he mo ved the grocery store in the living 
quarters. You understand? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Then when we -- the new store wa s built, mo ve
 it back, knocked over living quarter. Then he 
finished living quarters, now this
 house was done. Then he went 
cross the street, he build the 
house which he figure for us, says one day I™m a -- 
want to retire, if I sell the whole thing we 
have a place to live. And then he bought additio
nal property, was right on 
the border, a lot with 
the house next to it, he bought it also.  

Q: But that had all been confiscated by the time -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
37 
 
 
A: That was all the [indeciphera
ble] by the Nazi. We got back
 everything but the last house 
where was --  what my dad built for us, and we will never get back because is post offi ce in it, to 
this day. 

Q: Hm. But you did get back the other? 

A: We  did get the other, and we sold it. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. Yeah. 

Q: But the stuff that was in the house, you -- 

A: Was [indecipherable] 

Q: It was -- it was gone. 

A: Gone. 

Q: It was gone. 

A: Very fast. 
Q: Right. 
A: Now my father took all silverware. 

Q: He did? 

A: Yeah. And he buried it in the house, in our 
house, he bury it in the house. Now, that was 

1941. In 19 -- we came to Kansas City, ™49, in
 1955 - 1955, a Croatian guy -- well, I -- you 
know, it™s so difficult tell you my story in 
a -- in right chronological order. 
Q: It™s fine, it™s fine. 

A: And I™m jumping. 

Q: I™ll -- I™ll reme mber. 

A: When we  were sent to Kansas City -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
38 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know, at random, we didn™t have no choice. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The Jewish community just send us to Kans
as City, and -- and my mother said, you know, 
Kansas City, I think that one guy that work for us
 on our brick factory, he -- he got ma rried and 
he went to Kansas City. And his name  was Nicola
 Rodina. I wonder if he™s living in this town. 
Now he come before the war, first World Wa r, 
to ma rry his sweetheart, then war happen, he 
couldn™t come  back to America. So he and 
his sweetheart live -- and he  worked for my 
grandfather and my dad til the war was over, andthen after the war, around 1930, went back to 

Kansas City, where he started. And he was work
ing -- you know, Kansas City was third biggest 

city for meat packing house, and you had the Swif
t, [indecipherable] Ar mour, all of them were in 
Kansas City. So they were working because di dn™t need much language to be a butcher. So 

Mother go over there, pick up in the telephone 
book [indecipherable] Rodina. And he had a son 
about my age, and we [indeciphe
rable] right away, and we become  friend. But in 1955, this Nic 
Rodina that used to work for us, goes back to 
Croatia for first time. And my father said, ﬁNic, 
you want to do me  a favor. In my house,ﬂ and 
he write him -- ma ke him a  sketch of -- a 
schematic. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: ﬁIn this part I buried
 all of our silverware. Take a shovel, 
see what the hell is there.ﬂ He take a 
shovel, the first time he pushed it -- because 
our basement by the way, it was no concrete. 
Basements are dirt. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
39 
 
 
A: The first time he push a shovel in, it hit the 
me tal box with the stuff. The first. Took him 
exactly 10 seconds to hit a spot. Right on themoney. He brought all the silver. Now whatever 
was silver was okay, but we discovered the hand
les, you know what I me an, it was not silver. 
Knife, and blade and the stem was silver. 

Q: Right. 

A: So when you brought everything -- spoons
 were no problem, forks were no problem. 
Q: But knives. 

A: I™m talking knife. So when he brought it to Ka
nsas City we had the new stems put with the -- 
I got -- the silver was there in Kansas City. 

Q: The same  -- 

A: -- silver yes, but [indecipherable]. So s
ilver didn™t rot, but wh
atever it was not -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- what was not silver , it rot. That was just
 like a little postscript to --  to the stor y. 
Q: Did you have to be explained why 
you were going, or was it really clear? 

A: No, it wa -- I -- to me it was very clear 
why I was going, you know, when -- when we first 
arrived and were confined in this little community
 of -- of si -- Concor
dia Santa Catarina, which 
is, you know -- Modena is a breadbask
et of Italy. Wheat, grain, fruit, 
you name  it. So they told us 
right away in -- Italian police in Ljublja
na, they say hey, you guys, you got it ma de.  

Q: How did you know in Ljubljana 
that you were going to Modena? 

A: We didn™t.  

Q: Oh, you didn™t. 

A: We ca me over there -- my dad come over ther
e to police departme nt. [indecipherable] say, we 
are going to send you to Italy, insi
 -- inside Italy, and you™ll be 
confined to a little community. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
40 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And they gave a whole bunch regulation, you ca
nnot socialize with Italians, you cannot work 
over there. You have to report to the f -- fascio. 
This the Fascist head police once a day, head of 
the family, so we know that you are in the to
wn. They™re not going to
 look for you, you better 
show up there. And give us all thes
e rules. And that -- that was not 
diffi cult to f --  to -- to follow. 
But the Italian [indecipherable] people. I mean, Icannot find the words to describe my love for 

Italian, because when we arrived to the -- in Mode
na, and we went to quest
ura, which is a police 
headquarters, which in Fascist Italy -- and I™m not talking regular police, I™m talking Fascist 

Italy. Italian everythi ng they do they have thei
r own political version. Even Italian communists 
go to church. I™m telling you how ridiculous it is. Th
e red shirts and the flag in the church at the 

confession. So they -- they modifi
ed the -- the convenient. So we 
go to this questura and he tell 
us, now these are the community
 around here. Do you have any pa
rticular town that would you 
like to be confined?  And my father say I would lik
e to go to a little town that is not expensive, 
and that there are nice food around. They says, 
I™ll tell you where I™m going to send you to 
Concordia sua Secchia. Secchia is 
a be -- river. Concordia on the 
ri -- on the Secchia river. He 
says, fantastic bread, everything 
was rationed, the -- with the fa
rmer really, your ration cards 
would be superfluous even if you sh -- needed to 
go to the store, but farmer will supply whatever 
you want over there and you can enjoy yourself. And 
he gave us all this rule that we go over 

there. So when we trooped up 
to this lady, that she was divor
ced for a high ranking Italian 
officer, she was living with a sister and a daughter. Daughter was about -- I was at that time 

already fi 15, I think -- no, ma ybe 14 and a ha
lf, 15, she was 18. And so there she was looking, 

oh my God, I -- she was in [indeci
pherable] in a sexy and all that
. And then my fa mily engaged 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
41 
 
 
her to teach me Italian. And my
 Uncle Pawel, and Ruza are alre
ady with us, in the same  house 
[indecipherable] with them. 
Q: Is that the Mitrani and adio -- 

A: Mitrani, yes. 

Q: Andreoli? 

A: Andreoli Mitrani. 

Q: And is it Andreoli mita -- Mit-Mi trani? 

A: Mitrani Andreoli. 

Q: Andreoli. 

A: Mitrani is the woman married to the [indecipher
able], Andreoli is the si ster, because  sister 
never marry. So she keep the maiden name. 

Q: I see. 

A: You understand? 
Q: Right. 
A: The Italian officer was name d Mitrani. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they had a daughter, Anna Ma ria, and sh
e was teaching me  Italian. And my uncle, he 
was looking over there from the balcony when she 
was teaching me  Italian. He says, ﬁYou know, 
Zdenko, if you want to learn Italian -- I watch 
you from balcony, you have to stop staring at her 
breasts. I mean, are you -- you are 
not paying one word of attenti
on what the woman™s teaching.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁHow do you know? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI™m watc
hing you from window [ind
ecipherable].ﬂ Said, 
do you know any -- do you know anything what she to
ld you?  And I would ba-ba-ba, I start 
[indecipherable]. He was right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
42 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And that was the end of my 
staring. And he told her, he 
says, you know, you™re a yu -- pretty 
young lady, and you want nephew to teach hi m It
alian, dr ess up a little different. A young boy, 
his hormones star -- start working, you know, ma ke 
possible for him to concentrate what you are 
doing. But was very funny, that
 -- that™s a little -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- postscript into the whole story.
 But they took us in. Now, when -- 
Q: No, wait, I™m going to have stop you because 
we -- I™m sorry, we have to stop the tape. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: How long are you in the occupied zone be
fore you get to Lub -- Ljubljana, do you think? 
A: Nine mo nths.  
Q: Nine mo nths. 

A: Nine mo nths, yes, we  were hiding in 
a little town called S
ilvo, S-i-l-v-o. Real -- 
Q: S-i-v-l-o? 

A: Oh, yeah, this town wa s ma ybe 200 population.  Is right between commune of Grobnik, that I 

me ntioned before, and Shushak. Really a small to
wn, but we -- we tried to be a -- you know, a -- 

a -- as unseen as possible. So we found in 
a -- by -- old lady, you know, about 75 years old, she 
had a room to rent. So my parents, they ki
nd of crammed in there, and nobody in town know 
about us, that we even there. 

Q: Now why are you hiding there? 

A: We are hiding there because was Italian occupa
tion there, but we™re afra
id if Italian get hold 
of us, they mi ght turn us back to the Croatian Na
zi because they hi -- they were sharing authority 
in that zone. 

Q: Right. 

A: There was not complete
ly Italian authority.  
Q: So how -- who was figuring out how to 
get out?  This was your father who was -- 
A: We ll, when we were there we were aware that 
in order to reach a complete safety we have to 
go in Italian zone, which is annexed.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: Not occupied. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
44 
 
 
A: Quote unquote, there™s a big difference annexed and occupied. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we know that because we™ve still -- we s
till saw even that Italian had the final word. 
Now, if you were -- we got caught one time by Italia
ns. See, is only [indecipherable] what Italian 
catch you. One time they caught us, they were ready to
 ship us back to Zagreb and the -- and we 
were begging, please don™t send us, you know wh
at™s waiting for us. They guy say, you don™t 
know. So there were five Italian cops, and th
ey were arguing betw
een them, we couldn™t 
understand. Little bit, not very much. They were
 dickering. One guys said
, let them go, why the 
hell you playing around with them?  And they said no 
we can™t help it, our duty -- well, we are -- 
we allied of Germany. Send them back to Zagreb
. So it™s -- they said, you know what, let™s ma ke 
a smart thing. So you want feel guilty that you didn™t carry order and that
 I didn™t carry order. 
Let™s tell them that we go for lunch, and we beback in 30 mi nutes and that™s why they don™t -- 

and I don™t have to tell you how quick we [indeci
pherable]. But that™s only happen in Italy. I 
mean, all the Italian with the stuff like they 
said, hey listen you guys, you 
are [indecipherable] in 
the arrest but by the way we go for lunch, but don
™t go anyplace, we™ll be
 back in 30 mi nutes.  
Q: Could you understand some  Italian? 

A: Very little. 

Q: Very little. 

A: But -- no, but once I got in Italy, young, I 
couldn't go to school, so the only organized 
playground is the church backyard. Everybody was th
ere. I mean, they -- the movies, priest was 
showing, you had the ping pong table, he had the bask
etball tab -- ev-everythi
ng what the kids in 
this little town which we were confined, [i
ndecipherable]. So I become , you know, with -- when 
you are with the kids, you pick 
up Italian very fast. And for me is no problem to ge-get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
45 
 
 
integr ated. A ma tter of fact, to a certain point, I 
got integrated little too much because my parents 
noticed that I was going st -- sit
ting at the ma ss, and the one time they short of the kids, and the 
priest  talked me into be --  helping serve the 
mass, and I come home, I could serve the mass better 
than those Italian kids. Why?  B
ecause during the Hebrew school -- 
see, the -- the Testament, Old 
Testament is same . And t he kids my age didn™t get to New Testament yet. So what they knew, I 
already was way ahead of them. A
nd priest was very impressed with
 it. [indecipherable] told me , 
how do you know, and he says -- I said we Jews 
didn™t have to worry about New Testament. We  
worry only about the Old Testament. So he sai
d, would you like to go ove
r there and help serve 
the ma ss?  I said why not?  What is in it for me ?  
He says cakes and cookie 
and hot chocolate. I™m 
in.  

Q: Now let me  go back to Ljublja
na again. Is -- was this typical 
that if you got there, you could 
go to the authorities and say you 
wanted to get to Italy?   
A: Me and 2,000 other ones. 
Q: There were 2,000 Jews? 
A: 2,000 Jews. Even some  Austrian Jews. Once you 
reach Ljubljana and you were Jewish, this is 
such a amazing thing about Fascist Italy. That th
ey let you in, but they 
didn™t want to know you 
were there. Like reme mber in th
e previous segment when I told you that they give us list of do 
and don™t do? 

Q: Yes. 

A: We ll, when we got over there with all these 
restriction, and my fath
er™s reports the first 
morning to the -- to Fascist headquarters, said, he
re I am. Then he come next morning there. And 
finally the third day th
e guy told him, ﬁ Why you bother me  here every morning,ﬂ he says. ﬁI 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
46 
 
 
know you are here.ﬂ He said, ﬁBut we  supposed
 to,ﬂ -- ﬁI know. If you are mi ssing here, 
some body™s going to tell me . Don™t bother me  no more.ﬂ  
Q: I see. 

A: Then if you want to go to movie, you need
 a special permission. So I was a young kid, I liked 
to go to movie, every time they -- there™s a bi
g plaque at the [indecipherable]. No American 
movie, Italian -- Italy ma de lots
 of movies, lots of -- ma ny of 
them propaganda movie and stories 
and -- and I was going to movie every sun -- when th
e -- owto -- if Fascist author ities saw me  in 
the movie, they wouldn™t bother, they™d turn 
around, they didn™t want to see me . The y didn™t 
want to know I™m there. 

Q: So how -- how -- how did you 
understand this?  I mean, you come  
to Italy, they have anti-
Semitic laws. 

A: Ye-Yeah. 

Q: The Jews have been thrown 
out of some  occupations, right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So there™s a certain level -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- of oppression. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Then there™s anothe r level 
where there is no oppression. 
A: No oppression. 

Q: It™s -- it™s very -- 

A: Because -- because Italian are flexible. That
™s a very good word to describe. Italian are 

opportunist ic. Italian -- no, first time
 that we come  to little town it says, oh, the Fascists told us 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
47 
 
 
that you Jews were take -- taking eyes out of 
the kids and that™s why you™re confined. I said 
that™s a bubkes. That™s not true. And th -- when
 they got acquainted with you, when they notice 
on daily basis the way your people with a -- when 
they saw that we went, asked the farmer for 
bread, or to give us some fl
our, or to share us the flour, 
everything. We  th -- it -- it was 
unbelievable, the response of the community, we f
eel so comfortable. Now we come to the -- the 
September, or armi stice, that we got so excite
d, and finally the war is over. At this point, 
Americans already past Sicily, 
they landed on the boot of Italy, and on Calabria. And they™re 
ma rching their way the boot. And we are in Flor
ence. That™s like 450 miles down the boot. Lots 
of mountains. So we, a little educated, we knew wh
at was expected that th
ere™s not going to be a 
pancake, especially the Ge
rman from the Brenner -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- were comi ng out. But when we had to run to
 go back when -- when the Italy collapsed, you 
know, and when we had to run, the questura, the -- 
these Fascist headquarters 
that tell my father 
pick up where you want to go, he send the word to 
the priest of the town 
telling people to get -- 
he had a -- a lot of that, because st arting tomo
rrow Nazi are taking over,
 I™m out of business. 
[indecipherable] ever prot ect hi m, so whatever 
you can do for them, do for  them. Then the -- the 
Andreoli relayed this to us. Andreoli had the conn
ection with the priest in Florence, and they call 
that pr iest  in the Florence, said we got these re
fugees here, and we™re going to have to put them 
some place because Ame r icans are comi ng up the boot
, we know that it is only a question of 

time. Can you help us?  So the priest said, I see what I can do. And sure enough [indecipherable] 

they couldn't s -- we had only hours, said okay, te
ll him to go to -- to Florence, and go to such

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Q: Right. 
A: It™s a little 
leather good store. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Ha me r leather goods store, a
nd selling to -- ca -- look for Se
nor Torchi o. Senor Torchio is 
going to take  over from there. Now this is only two blocks from Ponte Vecchio. 

Q: Right. 

A: Okay?  

Q: When Ponte Vecchio is -- 

A: Is on the ri -- that™s right. So
 they say we -- they send us over 
there, we  already on next train, 
we have a problem. We  got to ma ke to -- to Flor
ence, and from the station to that store roof, 
mi ssed the -- we™re -- was -- 

Q: How do you get there? 

A: Yeah. We went on the foot, 
we didn™t want -- we tried to
 be  like 20 - 30 feet apart, 
individually, not as a family. A
ll these Fascist It alian with the 
Nazis decoration and I™m talking 
hard [indecipherable] they volunteered. They were
 embarrassed because Italy collapsed. So we -- 
finally we made over [indecipherable] I got pl
ace for you, it™s not very far. You go over there, 
and via Borgo San Jacobo, this is a street right 
ne xt to Ponte Vecchio, and th-the  houses all -- 
one was on the [indecipherable] and the other wa
s across the street. And 
wa -- were called via 
Borgo San Jacobo and was going -- extending about 
three, four blocks. He  say go and visit -- I 

forgot the nu mber exactly, and talk to the housekeeper, who take care of palazzo. They -- the 

garden apartment in palazzo. She was called --
 so called portiniya, you know, that™s a -- in 
charge of whole building [i
ndecipherable] whoever needs 
anything. Here you would call it 
doorman, but she was not doorman. You come to this
, you at s -- anyway, in this apartment was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
49 
 
 
Italian colonel, very big Fascist, who was so asha
me d that Italy collapsed, 
that he volunteered for 
Russian front. Now, wha t  the Nazis di d, the S.S.
 come , seal his apartment, because he knows 
some body else is going to try to rob 
it or take it over, some  Nazi
 or Fascist, so nobody can touch 
it. So obercommand fr om deutsche politsi sealed 
the apar tment with a seal. But she has a key 
from back door. So in this apartment of this Nazi
, we were refuges in there with Ruza, with this 
attorney husband, my father and me . Ruza was the 
only versatile enough to go in the street not to 
be s-suspected she™s not Italian. She blended in
 perfectly and Italian was quite good. So all the 
supply that we needed -- 

Q: She got. 

A: -- was Ruza provide. 

Q: Your mother™s there too, yes? 

A: Yeah, what -- this th -- oh, five of them. Bi
g a partment. Ah, there™s a radio, we were listen 
radio London, and [indeciphe
rable]. Had everything. 
Q: Yeah. But you have to hide there, you have to -- 

A: We  are hiding, of course, nobody in
 building know we are there. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we didn™t worry that some  Nazi come  in
 because it™s sealed. My mother catch t-typhoid 
while we are here in that apartment. 

Q: Typhoid? 

A: Typhoid. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So again we go back to Mr. Torchio. He sa
id, [indecipherable] okay, 
I get you a doctor. At 11 

o™clock at night, Italian Fascist 
doctor, a ma jor with a Fascist uni
form, come  over to the door and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
50 
 
 
tell to Neila Fussi, that our house 
ki -- was hiding at -- say you 
got here a Jewish family hiding, 
and she almost doody in her pants. She said yes. 
Say, I™m a doctor so and so, that Mr. Torchio 
send me  ove r, you got some  people sick here. So
 he was comi ng there 
every night, giving us 
shots, and taking care of my mother, at the ri
sk of his own life, that™s why he™s comi ng 11 
o™clock at night. Stealing the serum from the milita
ry supply, til my mothe r  got well. After the -- 
four [indecipherable] say no, it™s very dangerous
 for me  and for you, I don™t want to come  
because some body mi ght follow me . You know, 
you never what they do [i ndecipherable] 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- he said. Now, she™s to the 
point of recovery, she™s not inf
ectious any more, so you can relax 
a little bit. But one thi
ng she is desperate is a 
vitami n C. Whe r e the hell do you get vitami n C?  
Again you go back to Mr. Torchio, to a -- and don™
t worry about it, he said. It™s a monastery up 
there, the hill above Florence, the nuns. They 
growing lemons on the tree inside monastery. Next 
day we had all the lemons and stuff that we wante
d. Just to give you a little [indecipherable] this 
is absolutely mi nd boggli
ng. So my mother weather this thin
gs out. Now, Americans already in 
front of Florence. German are feeling the he at. And German Hauptcomma nder give the order 
that all the streets facing th
e Arno River have to evacuate be
cause there™s some body that screw 
up in [indecipherable] think American won™t be 
able cross the arn -- Arno River. Now, the only 
city they didn™t blow up is Ponte Vecchio. 
Now everybody thought that Ponte Vecchio, first of 
all, Germany loved the arts, and they didn™t wa
nt to destroy. It was some thing else, German 

engineers, they figure out Ponte Vecchi
o cannot hold American Tiger tanks. 
Q: Anyway. 

A: Yeah, so they will not tr -- the Americans ar
e not stupid, is not going to
 close it. So when the 
Americans -- they didn™t touch it. So they left this
 here. With the rest of it, where we lived -- but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
51 
 
 
it didn™t blow up. They gave us four hours to 
mo ve. Not us, the whole build -- now we didn™t 
want [indecipherable] no more, because now 
we are [indecipherable] with Italian. 
Q: Right. 
A: 4,000 refugee in Palazzo Pitti. Now, that™s wher
e is -- where all the art 
gallery be, all the fun 
stuff. Now, t he shelf where used to be those e
xpensive things, we took th
e picture and pile them 
against the wall, and those were our beds, because they were 18 inches apart. Now in the garden 

there were two wells of water. Now, for four
 days, the 4,000 people only supplied the water for 
them in this Palazzo Pitti, was this thing. No ba
throom facility. But we really made that flower 
garden really flourish. Now you -- 

Q: Are you staying outside? 

A: Oh no, no. We  -- we -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- we™re i-in the -- in the garden -- 
Q: Inside. 
A: -- inside, during the night, all 
of them in the building. Younger 
people, without the kids, they 
were sl-sleeping in the garden, th
ey didn't want to. But for us they give us, with the family, we 
were using the shelves as a bed. Didn™t haveno ma ttress or anything, a blanket, or you coat, 

whatever you could put under the head. 

Q: Right. 

A: On the fourth day, about three o™clock in th
e morning, when they blow all the houses, and I 
hit the -- the air percussion was 
so strong that my  head hit the bunk above it. I really -- moved 
me  up [indecipherable] everybody, 
we know bye-bye, Germans are gone. Now here come  the 
Americans. You know how long took Americans 
to cross river?  They brought those big 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
52 
 
 
Caterpillar bulldozer, and they fill up the Arno Ri
ver in two hours. Italians
 -- the whole Florence 
come  to see what the hell that stupid Ameri
can™s doing. Like nothing. They use the ruins of the 
building, they actually done him a 
fa vor. They just pushed the debris in the river. But they were 
smart, they couldn™t keep it very long, otherw
ise they would block the flow of the river. 
Q: Right. 

A: When they were on the o-other side, they
 cleaned it up dimen -- and then they come , 
American pontoon engineer and put those temporar
y bridges in -- in 48 hours river wa s flowing 
and American was going both direction. Now co
me  -- we report right away to American 
authorities. And they tell us, okay, we got the ca
mp in Rome , which all the foreign refugee, now 
quote unquote, who are awaiting repatriation to th
eir homeland are going ahead to the camp of 
Cinecitta. Now we are going to move you on the tr
ucks partly, and partly the trains, because 
some  part the [indecipherable] train is not wo
rking. So we have to move you from Rome  to 
Grosseto by truck, and then we put you on the 
train to Rome . We couldn™t care less, we ™re 
sleeping the army tent, I got intr
oduced to the corned beef, and 
to all the American good stuff 
with the breakfast. Egg -- powdered eggs, th
e first time in my life, you ever tried them?  
Q: No. 

A: You wouldn™t believe it. You would -- you -- 
but was all kind of food you wanted. Bacon, oh 
my God, wa s comi ng out of your ear. And you coul
d eat as much as you want. I me an, there™s 

not such a thing you what -- what is -- 

Q: And who was cooking?  What was -- 

A: American army. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you  

A: Was ya -- you -- it was just -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
53 
 
 
Q: -- so you were eating w
ith the [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was regular under tent
s you know, no building. When -- 
Q: Under tents? 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- it was sh -- f -- like MASH, only w
ithout the hospital in the field tent. 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- and then they put the truck, take us
 to Ro me . No w we arrive
 -- we were liber ated 
some ti me  in the first part of the August, th
 -- took about, I think, one weeks journey from 
liber ation to arrive in Rome. By time we arrive
 in the camp in Rome, Evie was there already 
because she was liberated four days before me
. She was further down south. But that time  her 
mother was working, her father was working, and 
in -- in order our family, which was friend of 
Evie™s from V-Vienna, they were in Ferramonti. They were liberated before so they we re first in 
the camp, and that™s was a mother, father, daughter 
and Kelmer was a son-in-law of that Wi nkler 
fa mily. Fa mily was Wi nkler and son-in-law was 
Kelmer. And he was a t
ypical Jewish Viennese 
finagler. Al-Always know his [indecipherable] to find. It took him exactly 10 days that he 

become  a general ma nager of the kitchen for ref
ugee. He spoke a little Italian, spoke a little 
German, he was able to get connection with 
Americans, say hey look, 
you™re a guy, we need 
some body t o run this kitchen, we got about tu
rnover between 900 and thousand prov virtually 
every week, and we need to put it together a st
aff to feed and take care of it. Now one thing you 
know about American, they
™re not multi-lingual. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
54 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So they need a multi-lingual st aff to take care
 of this [indecipherable] because there were 10 - 
15 nations. But next to us was a Italian camp, still 
in Cinecitta, just for 
Italian refugee. That 
Italian [indecipherable] took care of it. But wa
s a big different in th
e food and supply what 
American were taking care of in Italian [indeciph
erable]. So Italian refugee would be delighted 
to be in the foreign camp , but couldn™t get in
 foreign na -- now, by the end it came  they were 

looking -- i-if car -- is appro
aching some  kind of American holiday, I don™t reme mber  if was 
Labor day or whatever it is. And American guys th
e officer wanted to have a holiday. So they ma  

-- they send a feeler out, any 
of the refugees you know how to 
cook, we need a cook and a baker 
to make cakes. So I asked my mo -- my mother
 says how long for how long. He says, well all 
depend how good you cook. So sh -- my mother st
art cooking for 30 guys. Now, Evie™s mother 
was already working for the employees of th
e camp. Now Kelmer, that guy who was first 
arrived, he was running refugee kitchen, so I™m te
lling you how those Jews got all situated in key 
position. Now my mother wa -- pure accident ally 
because my mother was a gourme t cook and a 
baker. So she prepared, you mi ght think, Labor 
day meal wha t  -- August was Labor day, because 
we arrived in August. And she cook him a pishinger 
torte and a Dobish torte,
 and a Sacher torte, 
a -- you name  it. And the guy said -- and then sa
y she cook him paprika golish and stuff. Sa -- 
says hey listen, we got to hook up with the girl
. So she -- Mother told him, you know what?  You 
have three Sl ovenian guys, helpers. All of them know about cooking 
a little bit. I™m c onsidering 
the deal, but I want those three guys as help
ers because I cannot handle it by myself. I know 
these guys know what they are doing, and if I gi
ve them direction [indecipherable]. She got the 
job. Now my Aunt Ruza that was lib
erated with us, when we come  to the camp the first thing 
they want to i-in -- gi ve us injection and all th
e protection all diseases. But my Uncle Pawel ba -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
55 
 
 
my s mart attorney, is like Evie™s brother, no 
injection of me . Nobody™s 
going to poke me  with 
the needles. Next day he left the camp to 
live in Rome . Found hisse
lf a little apartment 
[indecipherable]. And they never came back to cam
p. Lucky for them [indecipherable] order that 
my mother got job in the kitchen, because they 
never had to spend a di -- dollar for grocery. 
Q: Mm-h m 
A: They came  twice a week for the food supply that you will not believe it, the shopping 

[indecipherable]. It just happened 
the chief of police, again a ref
ugee, was a gradanier, Serbian 
gradanier from Belgrade, he was a royal guard, about
 six foot five, he become s chief of police. 
We become  friendly with him, a
nd that [indecipherable] our fa m
ily was schlepping this stuff, 
said did you come  for the supplies? 

Q: He knew. 

A: He not only knew it, he say that™s what they
 have, you want me  to get you Jeep to take you -- 
they were living in piazzi [i ndecipherable] ma ybe
 only four miles down the road fr om Cinecitta. 
Q: And Ruz a  is with him?  Cause it -- 

A: Yeah, Ruza is with Pawel in the apartment.
 Ruza was carrying, and Pawel, but some  of the 
stuff is heavy, you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: They had to catch a streetcar to go back. 

Q: Right. 

A: So he ask him, you want my Jeep to take you 
home . It was so funny. He -- Evie -- when sh -- 
when Evie was standing next to him, he was 
resting his elbow over on Evie™s head because she 
was so small. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
56 
 
 
A: Sorry. But that™s why my mother got employe
d in the camp in Cinecitta, and -- and we 
thought we were living like ki
ngs. Now people, who went out to Rome  on their own become  
wealthy. They were dealing with gold, they were 
dealing with all kind of mi shigosha zachen on 
the black ma rket. But we were content, we didn'
t want to take any chances, we didn™t want to 
rock the boat, we were very happy and we live lik
e king because we got those private rooms that 
used to be dressing room of the stars. Like, we 
were in a room that us
ed to be dressing room 
from Italian actress Alida Valli, I do
n™t know if you ever heard of her. 
Q: Her -- see, I don™t know her -- 
A: Okay, but -- 

Q: -- but I know it was great film -- 

A: Well -- 

Q: -- studio. 

A: -- so we were -- and we had the running water 
in the bathroom, and a
ll of that. And then I 
hooked up with Evie™s brother and Heinz Wi nkler.
 That was the brother-in-law of Kelmer -- 
Kelmer and Mary Wi nkler™s da
u -- really, Wi nkler™s sister. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they become  a little clique in the camp, a
nd I thought that I had died and went to heaven, 
I love it. Four -- five Austrian Heinz™s, and me  -- 

Q: And you. 

A: Yeah, I fell in this group. So it was four -- I 
couldn™t speak German, e xcep
t a little that I pick 
up at home. But those guys was constantly bla
bbering in -- in German, 
so I was forced to 
[indecipherable]. So we decide, l
ook, we got these [indecipherable]
 Jews for the camp, at least 
20 percent of that which -- let™
s or ganize Jewish community cente
r. Hell, the Americans have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
57 
 
 
their [indecipherable] and on thei
r own the Jewish community cente
r is getting all kind of goods 
from America. So we go over there to Jewish 
community [indecipherable] says, my name  is 
Moishka Pinsel, we would like to ma ke a Jewish community center in the camp at Cinecitta, 
what can you do for us?  Says, well you bring us th
e me mbership, give us the name  all the kids 
you have, and then come  once a week, [indeciph
erable] the chocolate, and the candy, and all 
information you need. Said, but you got to have 
some  kind of orth -- organization. Here -- go 
back in the camps, so I tell every brother, okay, 
you are going to be vice
-president, you are going 
to be treasurer, so m- ma ke a little legitimate th
ing. We  go Italian pr int shop, and we go to Italian 
haberdashery shop. We  gather those -- you know, 
like American hats wh
at the soldier wear?  
With a big Magen-David with a green background, and we become  a -- Jewish boys 

[indecipherable] Cinecitta. Come  
for the [indecipherable] Jewish 
-- the own special bridge, we 
create it. We  -- 

Q: From -- from this small group? 
A: From -- yeah. 
Q: And you didn™t -- you didn™t 
include other kids, it was -- 
A: Oh yeah, sure. 

Q: Oh, you did. I mean, but -- 

A: We were just the managing, see, because we are on permanent stock. 

Q: I see. 

A: The rest of kids were comi ng and going. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So they have to have a nucleus who is runni
ng the thing. And we ca me here with a room for 
meetings. And we had the mi nutes for the meet
ings, because Americans are not st upid, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
58 
 
 
wanted the mi nutes from the meeting before they 
give us chocolate. But first time that we got 
chocolate, give us so mu ch chocolate I tell to Wi
nkler, my fr iend that™s still live in Kansas City, 
said, ﬁListen Heinrich, we  got only 32 kids, Ame r
icans give us like 100 box. Let™s sell them back 
and ma ke money [indecipherable] 
Q: So you sold them? 

A: Yes. We still hadth
e -- more than we need. 
Q: Where did you -- where did you money to do these hats?  

A: From the  stuff that we sold. From the stuff 
that we sold, we got so much overflow of the 
goods that -- 

Q: From this chocolate. 

A: From the  ya --  

Q: You had extra money. 

A: -- chocolate and the candies, all 
the kind of stuff they give us.  
Q: And who did you sell it to? 

A: On the black ma rket, piazza redi -- 

Q: You sold it on the black ma rket? 

A: Piazza Vittorio. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. Right wi -- pi azza Vittorio. You coul
d sell anyt hing piazza Vittorio. Not then, even 
today. 

Q: Did your parents know that you were doing this? 

A: My parents didn™t know da mn thing except Ev
ie™s brother know, Wi
nkler know, I know, and 
children, because we have to fina
lly [indecipherable]. We  we re th
inking to charge a me mbership. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
59 
 
 
But how can you charge a me mbership to the kids 
who mi ght be three days 
in the camp, or mi ght 
be three weeks in the camp? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So we have to have a source of income .  

Q: Right.  

A: We  didn™t have our own sour
ces to go [indecipherable] with. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we had to come  fi gure it out to finag [i
ndecipherable] -- w-we did what American army 
does for last hundred years. You know, I learned that
 when I was drafted. I mean that, I was in a 
-- a quarterma ster. I would take a hundred pair of
 tee shirts, I will go to 
the motor pool and I will 
say, listen, I need the Jeep, I need
 this, I need that. I didn™t st
eal, I didn™t get a dime . But I 
changed the services [indecipherable]. I went to 
the kitchen in Tokyo and I told the chief cook, I 
said, you know what, I would like to come  -- 
when I come  from Tokyo, 
a little t-bone steak, I 
would like it when I come at 
two o™clock in the morning, kitchen is working all night, I don™t 
want that you give me  hard feelings. But you will
 never have to ma ke application for the white 
paints and the shirts, anything. You come  to me , I  ta
ke care of it. I™ll bypass the slips altogether. 
And that worked for me  for year and a half in Tokyo. 

Q: So it™s a lot of bartering. 

A: It™s wa -- oh, everything is bargaining. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: A ma tter of fact, when it was time for me  to
 come  back to United States, and that™s called 
return to Z.I. You know what™s a 
Z.I.?  Zone of Interior. And I say damn it, I went to Japan and 
Korea in the ship, I don™t want to do that again. Th
e army transport ship, you sleeping in the cots 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

eight high, one on top of the other. And I was stup
id that I was figure I don™t want to crawl up 
there, I was going to be the bottom [i ndeciphera
ble]. And the sergeant who was on top told me  
son, crawl as high as you can. So I™m not goi
ng crazy. He says, you™ll be sorry. Yeah, I was 
sorry, because everybody who got sick
 he would cough right down below you. 
Q: Right. 
A: So I learned, so I said I™m not going to go 
through this. So when I had to take a me dical 
examination to return back I said to my doctor,
 what can you do for me  to send me  back by air?  

Said, ah, that™s if you™re sick, wounded, high 
ranking officer. So, you know sir, I know you buy 
your uniform. How would you like to 
have a three pair of headqua
rters -- I mean lowquarter 
shoes, a couple of pair of boots, some underwear
, and I gave you a uniform to put me  on the air. 
Says how can you do it?  I says, you put me  on the 
air and you™ll see. He 
says, you have a deal. 
So he wrote a paper that severe motors -- moti
on sickness, that I got d
eathly sick. So -- but I 
didn™t trust that son of a gun, so I brought him a
ll the left shoes, and I brought him pants but no 
jackets. And I brought him shorts, but no tee-shir
ts. When I saw my na me  on the order that I™m 

going to States by air, I gave him the rest of it. A
nd I flew. I fl -- descended back the air. I was so 
excited that I was in 24 hours in California. Now, 
he put the manifest that I™m very si -- problem 

with sickness. He said, be sure when you arri
ve San Francisco, ambulance be there for you, so 
you better be very sick. So I was there, a
nd they sure pick me  up with the orders 
[indecipherable], but when we stopp
ed next to a telephone booth, I co
uldn™t resist to jump to call 
home  that I™m back in States. They caught me .No plane back to Kansas City. Boot camp to 

Ca mp Carson, Colorado peeling 
potatoes for two weeks. 
Q: We  have to stop the tape. 

A: Do you got --

End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Zdenko, when you were in Modena, when you went
 to Italy, did you have to have a change of 
name ?  Did you chan -- 
A: We do -- we do -- no.  

Q: You had no -- 

A: No, I had a -- I went to Italy with Zdenko Be
rgl, my father, none of the fa mily changed his 

name . We had a false name  later at a certain point
 when we went in the hiding, when we got the 
ma tter of our false paper which were issued to 
us during the German occ
upation of Italy, then I 
become Lui gi Bianchi. 

Q: And was that in Florence? 

A: No, whe n we -- when we had to run from M odena, you know, from -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Andreoli-Mi trani --  
Q: Yes. 
A: -- they figure out that she has to give
 us some  kind of paper if we get stopped. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So -- so we, again, through the ecclesiastic he
lp, the same  channels they use before, same  
pipeline, they gave us docume nts that -- the Ital
ian identity card that 
I have a photocopy it here. 
That I become  Luigi Bi anchi, my mother become
 Maria Bianchi, and my father become  Georgio 
Bianchi. And they gave us birth benevento, whic
h is southern Italy alre
ady in American hands. 
So if they wanted to find out if is true or 
not, they couldn™t. So they
 had the foresight when 
issuing the false paper, that they™re issuing fo
r a province there is no wa
y the Nazi or  Fascist 
could check it out.

Q: Right. But not -- not -- so
 this is when you were moving from Modena to Florence? 
A: Before -- before we went to Florence -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- they give us like ov
ernight those funny paper -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- if -- case we get st
op on the way to hidi ng place. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: To have some thing I.D., because -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in Italy at that time , every two steps some body ask you for I.D. 

Q: Right. 

A: So we didn™t want to press 
our luck to go, you know, a-around just for a walk. We  j ust needed 
to go from point A to point B, in case you get stopped you have some  kind of paper. And those 
paper were issued to us on the way to Florence. 
Q: Now, did you keep those papers when you 
were in Fl orence so you -- so in case -- 
A: I keep these paper -- no, I kept th
em in Florence, I kept them to 
-- to this day, til I turn it over 
to the institute in Wa shington. They kept 
the original, they send me  the photocopy. 
Q: I see. So you could use it at any time, obvious ly. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right. 

A: They did do -- if he would need 
it we could use it any time, yes. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
64 
 
 
A: Wethi -- done quite well. I mean, they were
 -- it was done in a m-
mo nastery, I don™t know 
which one exactly, above Florence. 
Q: Right. 

A: And they did a hell of a good job. 

Q: But when you were in Modena, you didn™t need anything? 

A: In Modena. 

Q: In Modena, rather. 

A: All right, in Modena I didn™t have any pape
r, because we were it -- Italian power, Fascist 
governme nt was in force. 

Q: Right, and it was -- 

A: And they didn™t ask me , we™re just who we 
were, we were Jewish refugee from Croatia. 
Q: And it was no -- 

A: So it was no problem, no, no, no. Til -- til -- til the mo me nt that the Germany took Italy over, 
we didn™t have no problem at all. We  could m
ove  more -- more than you -- more than you can 
even imagine. 
Q: So you were outside playing, and --  

A: I was with the kids playing, my fa ther wa
s going dealing with the farmer, we™re going to 
bicycle to neighboring town. N
obody ask anything. A ma tter of 
fact, when -- I™m goi ng to go 
take you back, I suppose you know
 a little bit about opera. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You fa mi liar name  Be njamino Gigli? 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
65 
 
 
A: When Gi gli come  to sing, I think, in ﬁMadam
e Butterflyﬂ in neighbori
ng town -- I mean, the -
- we went to see hi -- to list
en to him. I mean, you know, in It
alian it™s a big faux pas to say see 
him, you don™t see opera -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- you listen to opera. So we went to listen to
 him -- we went to ask can we go and listen to 
him, he says, what do you mean if you -- give a pe
rmission?  It™s a law that
 you got to listen to 
Benjamino. They were so proud of him. So we 
really had a -- you know, when -- when I think at 
the same  period the Jews were dying 
in these concentration camp --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- it was obscene how free we were. And we fe
lt free. We  never worried one single second til 
Mussolini was in power, for us. And I™m quoting in power himself, because once the Italian 

governme nt failed, and the new republic si -- 
si -- Repubblica Sociale 
Italiana, become in 
formation and Hitler arrested the me mber of Gr
and Consiglio, those are the people that voted 
Mussolini out of power, arrested 
all of them. In between him wa
s -- between them -- I™m trying 
to ration my self, so I better slow down. Betw
een them was Galeaggo Cino, which was his -- 
Mussolini™s son-in-l aw, which was married to E
dda Mussolini, ex-Italian ambassador in Berlin. 
Hitler hated his guts because ever y time come back
 fr om Berlin and told Mussolini, hi s father-in-
law, ﬁDad, German don™t know I speak fluent German. They think you are idiot. They think you 

are a patsy, they have no respect for you.ﬂ And H
itler wrote that he reported that to Mussolini, 
because Mussolini told Hitler, you know, I -- 
you think I™m such a joke because I got 
information. So didn™t take Nazi very long to put 
together that the only pe
rson present when they 
were ma king fun of hi m was Galeaggo Cino. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
66 
 
 
A: So when Italy capitulated they ma naged to
 arrest all the member
. Mussolini got nothing, 
Galeaggo Cino was shot in Verona with the re
st of the me mbe r  of the Grand Consiglio. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And whe n Edda went to her father and told him listen dad, you [indecipherable] I don™t want 

to ever know about you. Mussolini told Edda, my 
dear, I have nothing to say. And Edda didn™t 
believe him.  And when Mussolini was on the run, E
dda could saved him with partisans, but she 
didn™t want to. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because when they caught Mu
ssolini on the run in Como , in 
Swiss border, the partisan got 

ahold of Edda, and says, who? She told him she 
will never forgive hi m and she never did, til she 

died. 

Q: Cause she thought she had -- 

A: Yeah, now i -- i -- but a litt
le interesting background because 
we are going ho -- more -- more 
in depth than my own pi s -- personal biography, that
 Mussolini could have been saved, see, when 
-- when Cardinal Mont ini -- was Cardinal  Milan at that  time, later become Pope, he told Duce 

don™t leave anyplace, American be here in three da
ys. His entourage, that was loaded with the 

gold and jewelry, they were -- they were in 
hurry to cross the border and go to Switzerland 
because they figured that™s the only way they ca
n take booty across. And they figure if you have 
a Mussolini with that, you have a sure way to 
pass the border. We ll, th
ey didn™t, because at 
Zongo they caught him and all of them. But when
 -- Montini told him three times, Duce, don™t 
leave. And I have a personal feeling if he woul
d not run by American, Il Duce would be alive til 
he died a natural death, because mi s -- America would never kill hi m. But we felt very safe until 

Mussolini -- the way it was. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
67 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: We ne -- we never worry a si ngle second. [indecipherable] lots anti-Semitic law, he will -- he 

write the story what happen in It
aly, and there were unpleasant thi
ngs, especially for Italian Jews, 
they become  sort of -- Italian Je w rese nted Mussolini more than us, because  Italian Jews helped 

him get in power, so they become  ve ry resentful.
 We look at from different perspective. We  look 
to our savior. And they look at him and feel we
 were wealthy and prosperous, he took it away 

from us. 

Q: So [indecipherable] 

A: So it was nothing, you know, cutting -- you know
, it wasn™t simple solution. It was a much 
more complicated than appear in 
the surface. But that™s 
-- y -- that™s -- about th
is pe riod that™s all 
I got to say, except if you got any questions. 

Q: Where did you -- you had your 
Bar Mitzvah in ma  -- Modena? 
A: I had the Bar Mitzvah in -- in
 -- i-in Yugoslavia, in Sucha. 
Q: In -- uh-huh. 

A: That were part of the territo
ry occupied by Italia, not annexed. 
Q: Right. 

A: The -- the first pl ace that we run across, and was -- 

Q: Had you been studying for your Bar Mitzvah? 

A: No, no, nothing, nothing. 

Q: So -- so what was it like? 

A: It -- it was kind of winged unde
r -- like a underground Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: Did you do -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
68 
 
 
A: You didn™t have no Torah, you didn™t read, yo
u didn™t make a speech. My dear mo ther and 
father, my uncle and all this the Ame r ican kids
 do, it was nobody there. We were three poor Jews  
on the run. So th -- 
Q: So there was no rabbi? 

A: No -- n-no, it was no rabbi. It was 
a cantor that  we went to visit. 
Q: Oh. 

A: That he was in the hiding also. 

Q: I see. So it wasn™t a real thing. 

A: No, no, but -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- the best we can d-do on the -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- circumstances. You know, if you will go get a bunch toge ther Je ws to go ahead, to try to 
perform a ceremony, it be just like going a open trap. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Especially where you were -- 

A: So it was not -- it was not feasible, it was not 
possible. Now if that was -- if I had the Bar 
Mitzvah in Ljubljana, yes, it c 
-- we could have pulled it off. 
Q: You could have. 

A: Oh yeah, plenty Jews in Ljubljana.  

Q: In Modena were there other Jews? 

A: In mo -- in province of Modena, yes. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
69 
 
 
A: P-Province of Modena had approximately 250 Jewish families spread out. We  -- some  of 
t h em fro m C r oati a -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- some  of them Austrian. Lots of them I 
never had the chance to me et, but yes, we do, 
because i-Italian -- once i-i -- 
once Italian Jew governme nt accepted Jews to come  across, they 
didn™t send them no more in deep south. D
eep south, was only camping for a month there 
because Mussolini wanted to go ahea d and show Hitler that  he  put the Jews in a difficult 

position, which was not difficult pos
ition. For a month it was in very
 unpleasant climate, but if 
Italian could survive there, I mean, Jews can surv
ive also. But they put th
em there in the boot of 
Italy, clear in the bottom. But the rest of the 
Jews I would say nobody went souther than Naples. 
I mean in confinement by Italian government. 

Q: Mm-hm, right, right. 

A: I reme mb er in -- when my Aunt original 
-- Ruza and Pawel, they were sent to Rovigo, 
province of Rovigo, which is close to Padowa, 
and we were sent to Modena. And then we 
decided, why should the sister be se
parated?  L-Listen to this, is 
less conceivable. So we go ahead 
and write to Rome , and say listen, 
my name  is so and so, we appreciate very much for your help, 
but my sister is in province Rovigo, is only hundre
d miles from here, why we cannot live in the 
same  town?  There no problem. S-Se nd the paper to Ruza, mo ve over there to Modena with your 

sister. I mean, is incredible. 

Q: Right. 

A: Resume -- 

Q: Now, when you™re in Mode
na, when it™s -- it™s 1942 -- 
A: ™43 now. You talking armi stice. Ru
 -- my Ruz a  arrived there in ™42. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
70 
 
 
Q: No, it™s -- ™42, right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Before -- it™s be fore the armi stice -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- because you move d to -- 

A: Yeah. We were already in M
odena about six, seven months -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- then we  asked to join us and then we
 spend additional eight, nine months together. 
Q: Right. Are you hearing what™s going on in Eu
rope?  Are you hearing 
about death camps or 
anything? 

A: Not only that we -- we hear
d Italian propaganda because Ital
ian press and Italian radio had 
every hour bulletin. And one thing 
I like about Italian, Italian w
ould never have a bulletin that 
says American troops advance and we  lost the 
Sicily. Italian rado -- ra
dio would say some thing, 
according to our establ ished the plans of defens
e, we moved our defense troop on the other side 
of Straits of Messina. On the othe
r side of -- that mean that Si
cily is gone, if they move d the 
troops on the side of Straits Messina, if you know
 geography. In -- or if, like for example when 
they lost  Bali, it says in It alian, [speaks Italian here]. We retire -- we retreated according 

previously established plan. Baloney. They were 
after --  Mark Clark was after them til Naples, 
going like wildfire, then it stop. Fr om Napl
es on to Rome  took him five months.  
Q: Right.  

A: Because you had the Monte Cassino th
at slowed the whole operation down. 
Q: Mm-hm. That was a tough battle. 

A: Yeah. And Anzio.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
71 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Which is right next to Ro
me . And they were defending Rome . That™s why -- and they were 
sitting in Fl or ence with us listeni
ng to radio London three times a da
y in this apartment fr om this 
Fascist. 

Q: But that™s in Florence? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So, in Modena, what do you know about what™s going on? 

A: We  don™t know nothing. 

Q: You don™t know -- 

A: Once we left the Modena, we don™t -- we know
 only one thing, that Andreoli-Mitrani -- that 
as long as that money that we that we could go 
ahead, all -- we got him -- we give him a receipt, 
they give us this cash. And they know that my 
uncle was already in Switzerland, so that sh -- 
they not worry eventually if they catch us
, that he mi ght honor our promissory loss.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And on base of that they 
give us the money, but they di
dn™t have n-nothing guaranteed, you 
know, there™s -- there™s all -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- a promise in the sky. But they were more in
terested helping us than worry for this money. 
Q: And they give you 50,000 lira? 

A: 50,000 lira that would be 
money today about 12,000 bucks. 
Q: 10,000? 

A: 12. 

Q: 12. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
72 
 
 
A: 1200 bucks. 
Q: 1200 bucks. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s a lot of money then.  

A: We ll, a ton of money. Can you imagine whe n I come  to Kansas City, the mi ni mu m wage was  

75 cents. And that was before, so it was much 
m -- I don™t know what 
was -- and that was 1943, 
so mi ni mu m wage in America was probably 35 cents
. So it was lots of money, but they had the 
money, and they were not worried. Now, while we 
are hiding in Florence, they brought us food 
lots of times. 

Q: They did? 

A: Yes. But the ham, the prosciu
tto, e fromaggio, and all kind of -- 
Q: And they come up to the back door all the time? 

A: Always. 
Q: Everybody come s up to th -- 
A: Oh, everybody. N-No, that -- the front door seal
 was never opened, because the guy got killed 
on Russian front. He neve r came back. The apartment -- 

Q: I s -- I see -- 

A: -- the guy [indecipherable] he never ma de it back. 

Q: Right. 

A: So I don™t know exactly -- I -- 

Q: So how did you -- how did you keep so quiet?  There are f -- there -- 

A: You had to be quiet fi -- we ha
d to be very, very quiet, becau -- 
Q: So how did you use a toilet? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
73 
 
 
A: -- apar tment -- huh? 
Q: How did you even use a toilet? 

A: Oh, we didn™t worry about toilet because the 
apartment was in the mi ddle of the building -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and that was on the east side of the buildi
ng, it™s over the courtyard. 
So we didn™t have any 
tenant next door to us
 on left or right. 
Q: I see. 

A: You understand? So th-that were not -- we co
uld not talk loud, we c
ould not -- oh, there™s 
some thing, you talking about if I 
was spoiled. I know they could 
not yell at me, my parents. I 
mean [indecipherable]. I got away with murder. S
ee, I went with the husband of the woma n that 
I™m trying to make a right -- Ri
ghteous Gentile at Yad Vashem. 
That™s a -- that  was really 
ma naging this building. 

Q: Who™s this?  Neila Fussi? 
A: Neila Fussi, yes. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: With her boyfriend at that time,
 they were not ma rried yet. I us ed to go to horse races. I used 
to go to opera house with all the N
azis, only they were sitting down -- 
Q: So you used to leave the apartment?   

A: Oh yeah, with -- with her boyfriend. See, I spok
e fluent Italian. And at that time  was  about 15 
years old. 

Q: Right. 

A: And u-used to go to the horse races in the Hashima. I was l-like a regular It alian kid, til one 

time I got scare. We  were at the horse races, and 
the ki -- like, it™s a public park like, in Hashima, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
74 
 
 
and the -- and next to that park
 is a railroad tracks, but which ar
e really actually
 hi-hidden by the 
cypress trees, so you could not see the track or 
the train. The German put  a boxcar there, and 
waited for the sonderais to go ahead and pick a bunch of forced labor of so
lely Italian guys, to 
send them to Germany for labor camp because they 
were running short of labor force. But thin -- 
the -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the mi litary was 15 - 16 years old, German. 
So they came over there in the mi ddle of the 
race, they stop the race -- first when they saw th
e horses, and they riding on the boxcar, and then 
they push everybody towa rds the exit to get the working force to go. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now the -- the boyfriend of -- of my -- of Neila
 Fussi, when he saw that there was some thing 
going on, he says, Zdenko, you are young, so probably you will ge t away. I™m going to jump 

over the fence before everybody goes ahead to over 
there, and he disappeared. And he says I™m 
sure they will leave you alone. But I was not su
re because I was pretty good size boy. But I saw 
the exit next to me , a woma n, when she was -- 
while the German was talking to her, and she 
went to the German off the [ind
ecipherable] and the guy just kick
 her in her ass and pushed her 
out of the line. So when my turn come  up, I tu
rn to the German, he ask me  what™s your name , 
blah, blah, I say eh-eh-eh, he let me  go.  

Q: So you were acting as if you were -- 

A: If I -- I would never think of it if I didn™t 
see the woman who -- at th
e other exit. And -- and 
that™s -- after that 
I never left the apartment til liber
ation. Tha -- so -- so scared. 
Q: And you™re just so scared. 

A: Very close call. Not as a Jew. As Italian labor force. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
75 
 
 
Q: Italian, yeah. 
A: Because I was at that time already Luigi Bianchi. 

Q: You™re carrying those papers, yes. 

A: Yeah, yeah, sure. 

Q: Wa s -- was your mother and father able to 
leave, or they stayed in the apartment? 
A: They never left the apartment. 

Q: They -- 

A: Only my Aunt Ruza w
ill leave the apartment. 
Q: To get food. 

A: Yeah, and not even Ruza husband went out
. She knows all those guys from black market, 

they were bi -- they were butch
ering animal at home, and bri
nging, they would ask it -- Mrs. 
Rose, what you wanted to bring us next week?  She 
say give me  two kilo of stew meat, and then 
give me  some meat that I can use for baking a
nd whatever they wanted, 
I™ll need a f-five pounds 
of potato. And the guy would go ah
ead bring it -- deliver a supply 
like for a whole week. But not 
to house. We -- that we didn™t want  to do or 
show anybody. It was always a meeting place where 
the guy had the stuff and other people came. This 
he trusted, because he wa
s afraid the authority 
will know that selling on black ma rket without the points [indecipherable] you know. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So -- and we were never -- I -- this is --
 this shows you the blessi
ng, the -- during the whole 
war, was never hungry a single day. 

Q: I was going to ask you. Never hungry. 

A: Never hungry. Not only I was not hungry, for most 
of it I ate like a king. My mother were 
ma king a strudel and she was ma king all kind of 
cake, and she was ma king kochen, and she wa -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
76 
 
 
- you -- you name  it. And we were ma king goulas
h and the paprikash an
d the -- a-a-and the 
nowcurl and all -- all the home  cooking because we
 had -- we could do -- we had the flowers, we 
had the meet, we had the -- we had lots of veal 
and we had lots of pork 
also. One thing we didn™t 
have it, lots of fish, except 
r i ve r  fi s h . Lot s  of c a t fi s h . 
Q: A lot of catfish? 
A: Yeah, it was come  from Po Ri
ver, which was not too far.  
Q: Right. Did you mi ss not be
ing in Croatia, or -- 

A: I never mi ssed Croatia to this
 day. When I go back home, and my friends which are, by the 
way, very good to me  when I come  in, they very [i
ndecipherable] or -- orient
ed, like a big Croat, 
not anti-Semitic, but in spite be ing my friend, a
nd really th-they are good friends. To give you 
idea, I -- I -- Zagreb from Mila
n is about 280 miles, and my fri
end didn™t think a single second, I 
tell him my connection flightto
 Zagreb, I have to go to Milan 
catch flight. It was a very bad 
connection with the train, you have to change tw
o trains, you have to go two o™clock in the 
morning. He says, what™s your problem?  He drove
 me from his apartmen
t in Zagreb to the 
airport in Milan. Very few people do favors like 
this. Never thought of a single second, said 
what™s the big deal? I™ll drive 
you to the airport. And he did. 
And ma ny other reasons. Whenever 
I come  I stay in his house, and you have this [indecipherable] atmosphere. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: His wife cook. Now, his wife 
-- his father, or my friend docto
r, used to be sh -- town™s 
cobbler, not Jewish. He was ma king custom ma de 
shoes for farmers and for the big market once 
a month, he had a excess supply. Wo ma n used to co
me  buy the shoes, they were high shoes with 
laces, wi -- were selling, and he was quite well
 to do. And no bank in Zabno. So for any business 
dealing with -- need the extra money -- my fath
er, like you would need 50,000 diner, or -- or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
77 
 
 
or 100,000 diner, or -- or -- or -- 
or his neighbor, who was a shoema ker have to pay for leather, 
finish leather and sole leather -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and he needed a cash on the hand. [indeci
pherable] close to my father, and say look, I 
needed 35,000 diner, and my father with -- had 
no receipt, no nothing, [indecipherable] and went 
to [indecipherable] for years. He just went ahead, 
cause all -- if he had the cash, he give it to you. 
Nobody would dream [indecipherabl e]
 give you money. And we went
 til the -- til we had to go, 
that -- that we had to leave. 
And -- and we were always very
 friends and -- when we were 
growing up. The doctor is about two 
years older than me , so of c
ourse, he was like a leader of 
this little gr oup in -- in Zabno. We were all 
big soccer fans and play
ing soccer and so on. And 
whenever we go, when I return home, it™s so sad, 
and it™s so funny, and so blessing, that we go to 
the old stomping ground that we grew up and he 
drives me  around and say reme mber what we 
did here, reme mber what kind 
of -- we pul -- we -- you remi niscing what you youth, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and his eyesight is going bad right now, and 
very bad, he used to be general surgery. He -- 
he graduate for Heidelberg in Germany, and didn™t
 come  back to Yugoslavi
a til the -- Tito made 
him. Tito told him, I extended your visa so ma ny times. Now -- or you come  back to Yugoslavia, 

or I™m not going -- take away your
 citizenship, then you cannot come
 at all. Being that you have 
a fa mily, come  back. Why do you think -- they s
how you how Communist governme nt in itself is 
stupid, instead of using this e
xpre -- expert surgeon in the ho
spital in Zagr eb, they put him 
behind the desk. 

Q: Mm-hm. So -- so why wouldn™t you have mi ssed 
all of this when you were in Italy?  Is it 
because you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
78 
 
 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- I asked you whether you mi ssed it, because you™re -- 

A: -- I didn™t mi ss it because all I reme mber 
is the -- my childhood what I have. And I was 
growing. I outgrew my c hild day -- I was become
 in Italy a young -- my puberty reached me. I 
discovered girls. And in Ital
y you had all kind of girls. It
 was completely different 
[indecipherable]. I come from a little nothing town
 in Croatia, Sv. Ivan Zabno, end up living in 
Rome . I™m going from M odena to Florence and no
w in Rome . Now just imagine --  now this is 
one of the most sophisticate city in Europe. Is no
thing that was not available in Rome , especially 
for us that we  have a -- under umbrella of American occupation. I mean, we took Amer ican 

phony I.D.s, and we went to the streetcar, and th
e guys that ticket, you schlop in the -- the guy 
didn™t know what the hell I have. I 
di -- refugee camp I.D. cards. I 
didn™t have an I.D.. I used to 
ride on the train with the refugee I.D. card, becaus
e that  was a- after one -- 
years. Is very difficult 
for some body who didn™t live in th
is period to -- the concept 
what was happen. Once Italian 
governme nt norma lize and took over, this picnic wa
s over. But the life in Cinecitta didn™t change 
for next three, four years. You know, 
the refugees were going back and forth. 
Q: Then let me  ask you some thing. You -- your -- your
 parents, in some  ways, lose much more 

than you do. 

A: Yes. 

Q: By leaving Croatia. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Are they depressed by th -- 
I mean, do you notice that they --  
A: Okay, okay, when -- 

Q: -- that -- that they™re different than you are? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

A: Okay, n-now let™s go to Cinecitta liberation, okay? 
Q: Well I™m sort of -- I™m intere
sted both in the -- in -- cause
 Cinecitta already, everybody knows 
you™re safe, now you don™t know what™s happened to your family yet. 

A: Corre -- we -- we -- when the 
war -- the mi nute war was over -- 
Q: Okay. 

A: -- we know who was survive, 
who didn™t survive. We  know the 
uncle in Wi splete married to 
Genta was gone. The mi nute we hit Rome. We di
dn™t know it yet in Florence, okay?  But in 
Rome , in matter of few days, we
 know who survived the war. What we didn™t know, if we can 
go ahead and return home , or when, because of 
Communist regime in -- in -- in croa -- in 
Yugoslavia. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: The people took everything over.
 So really, they still didn™t 
have nothing. First the Nazi took 
over, now the commie take it over. Now, you wa nt 
me  to take off from this point? My father 
realized from the mi nut e that we have to run, al
ready in 1941 that it™s ve
ry unlikely we going to 
see anythi ng for a long time , maybe never. Sohe ma de the peace of mi nd. He were depressed, 

yes, he know he had to start again, but the othe
r hand, when my father was fighting for Austro 
[indecipherable] empire, he had his own business, wh
ich he lost it, because when Austria lost the 
war, he was on the other side of the border, he
 did come  out barehanded. 
That™s why he had to 
work again. He was in own -- own business. So th
at was second time he lost everything. So he -- 
that was like a repetition of the 
history. Each war costed them 
everything they accomplished. At 
that time Da d was not young any mor e , he was al
ready 45 - 50 years old. So the -- what -- 
beyond -- my father was very -- he always believe in
 real estate, so he we
nt -- i-it didn™t upset 
him very mu ch. It upset my mother much more
 than upset my father. Now, w-while we in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
80 
 
 
Cinecitta, the yugo -- Tito send his emissary to the camp to ma ke a speech to all the Yugoslav 
refugees that it™s time  to retu
rning home . A-And they 
invited all to a hall, and they went to look 
for everybody who come from Yugoslavia, and to
ld them the war is over, now you got a free 
country, it™s time to come home.  

Q: Right. 

A: No -- th -- from my father 
went to the guy who was a colonel 
with a big, red star, and the -- 
all this red leather as I reme mber
 like today, and he told him, ﬁD
ruze, Kamarade Bergl, it is your 
duty to return home .ﬂ And my fa
ther tell him, ﬁDruze, Kama rade, what you going to give me  
back? ﬂ  He sa id, ﬁDon™t worry.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou 
come  back, you will work.ﬂ He said, ﬁDruze, I 
didn™t ask you if I will work. I ask you what w
ill you give me back.ﬂ ﬁEverybody got the same  
thing.ﬂ ﬁI didn™t ask you what everybody got. 
Will you gi ve me  my pr
operty back? ﬂ  ﬁDon™t 
worry, you will work in your property.ﬂ ﬁAgain 
you avoiding my answer.ﬂ He says, ﬁDon™t 
worry, we going to come  pick you up next week
, you all go back home, you™ll be very happy.ﬂ 
Well my father told him screw it, I™m not going to
 go ahead and deal with this stuff. And when 
they come  next week to pick up people who 
are willing to go, my father didn™t show up. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So he send his goons with the 
red star, couple of so
ldier that he had on the truck, to look for 
my dad. So it™s -- my da d come  over there, and he
 tell him, ﬁWhy come y
ou™re not ready to go? ﬂ  
He says, ﬁWell, first of all -- first of a
ll, Nazis took everything from me , now you took 
everything from me . To go back 
to what?  That you employ me  in 
my own factory?  I -- I got a 
better future, I -- I™m not going to 
do that.ﬂ And he says, we come
 -- the Co mmie ca -- tell him, 
ﬁComrade Bergl, you see this star? You see deco
ration?ﬂ Say, ﬁI fought 
for your freedom.ﬂ And 
my father say to him, ﬁMr. Colonel, I got to
 tell you some thing. When I fought for your freedom 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
81 
 
 
as Austro-Hungarian soldier, you were not even a 
vision in your father™s
 eye. So don™t tell me  
what will fight for freedom.ﬂ I said oh my G
od, we™ll neve r go back home. But you know, if you 
go back to Yugoslavia, 
they will arrest you. 
Q: Right. 
A: That was the end of any possibility us returning. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That when we apply for immi gration to America. 

Q: Uh-huh. We need to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Four

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: When this comr ade guy from Croatia -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- is trying to convince your father to
 go back, and he refuses to go back -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- what year are we talk
ing about now?  Is this -- 
A: I can™t tell you exactly, we come  in th
e camp in 1945, this happened about end of 1946, 
beginning of ™47, but I don™t know exactly. We  left the camp in ™47 -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but as we -- chronologically you advance, I will bring it to this point, but I think this -- this 

happened shortly be fore we left the camp, because 
at this point we realize that we are not going 
back home. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: And we saw the ca -- Cinecitta was not so
lution, and I was now behi
nd i-in my schooling. 
Q: I -- I was going to ask you about that. 
A: Okay, now can -- can we go back -- 

Q: I -- I -- 

A: The first year that
 I arrive in camp -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- that was the August of 1944. By December 
of 1940 mi nister Italian of education pa ss a 
special ruling with all 
the refugees who couldn™t be going to
 school, or we re forbidden going to 
school, they can ma ke exam no matter what level th
ey finish when the war started, three years at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
83 
 
 
the time. Then my father hire some tutoring fo
r Italian and some  other subject, chemistry. But 
ma th, languages, history, geography, Ruza husband tutor me  for my exa m. 
Q: Hm, Pawel? 

A: Yeah. He™s -- he™s tutor me , a f -- and Wi nkl
er, the fr iend that™s st ill in Kansas City. 
Q: Right. 

A: He tutor us both for these subjects. And -- and 
the exam was to be taken not in Ro me , but in 
Castel Gandolfo, this is some  
-- a residential [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: Cinecitta was much closer 
to Castel Gandolfo than downtown Rome . So when the ma n -- 
when mi nistry assign us for this exam, they se
nd us to Castel Gandolf
o, and there where I took 
my three years of my junior high, and then six m
onths later I took what it
 takes to go f -- three 
additional years. 

Q: And you passed all those. 
A: Yeah, it was very tough, it was very iffy because it was lots of crammi ng to do, and when you 
c -- study so intensely for a short period of tim
e -- and oh, forgot most i mportant part, Ruza 
husband tutor me  in Latin, ma ndatory in Italy. La
tin, oh, you had to take 
it first three years of 
junior high you had to -- you had so much Latin
 you think you want to
 be a priest or a 
pharmacist. Because in Italy, in Europe, til 20 
years ago, every prescription was in Latin. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It™s not like here. 

Q: You had never studied Latin before. 

A: Never, never, so Ruza probabl
y -- he -- he was such a fantasti
c innovator, that to realize that 
these young guys, to -- to go [speaks Latin here], you 
know, it™s a verb. That™s very hard to cram 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
84 
 
 
all that you need. So he improvise kind of off color 
stories in Latin that he
 made us translate in 
Italian because he know that will sink in. Like
 he would say the -- I 
cannot tell you on camera, 
but it was very funny story. Like, 
he gallo -- this is not off-co
lor by the way, he [speaks Latin 
here]. Here is the rooster sitting on a tree and 
saying cuckoo-re-koo. But then he come  -- that™s 
how we started, then to get us more interest ed, he come to mo re color and it worked, because we 
come  intrigued, you know, what the hell it means, a
nd -- and we managed to squeeze in -- in my 
examina -- then when we left the camp in 1947, afte
r three years of Cinecitt
a, and my father said 
look, now you have to decide to do, 
and where you want to go to school. So my father left, he 
ma de a couple of trips to norther
n Italy, to figure out where we want
 to stay and live in Italy, and 
he come  up with Lake Como. He said was not the 
big city like Milano, is 
not the big cit -- Rome . 
The life [indecipherable] is happy go lucky, beauti
ful surroundings, sweet [indecipherable] next 
door. So we went over there, and I enrolled in 
architectural college [i
ndecipherable] in Como. 
And that™s when I started studying, and I went 
-- I was short one year when our paper come  
because I was tryi ng to catch as mu ch extra cred
it as I could, because I 
know sooner or later you 
come for America. But I didn™t manage to do them 
all, because I was short, I think, about four or 
five hour of credit. And when we ask postponeme nt
 for one  year, American embassy told us we 
can postpone, but you go in 
the bottom of the list.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And my father would not go 
to bottom of the list. And I was looking forward to go to the 
bottom of the list. I was not in 
hurry to go to America. A ma t t er
 of fact, I told my father, you 
know, you -- I™m not going to States. And my 
father said, ﬁYou know, I want to tell you 
some thing. First of all, I want you to know you™re 
in Italy. In Italy, til 
21, I™m running the show. 
If I have to go to Italian poli
ce to put you on the boat in Naples, I will do it. So don™t ma ke a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
85 
 
 
mi stake.ﬂ And I know he would have done it. So I finally give in, and -- and then we went to the 
Camp Obanioli when -- 

Q: Why didn™t you want to leave? 

A: Because this concept of a Euforia, and a l-la
nd of milk of honey, it was baloney. I know that 

America established with the hard work. It wa
s not such a thing as free lunch. I was smart 
enough, I was not -- I didn™t have 
a me ntal delusion. I was looking for what it is. Here I was -- 
my father was working his rear end to go ah
ead and send me  to school, my only preoccupation 
was to ma ke  a decent gr ade, which I tried to 
do a little bit by studying, 
but a lot by cheating. And 
I become  a expert -- if I would study so hard 
as I study how to cheat to
 pass a test, I™d be a 
genius. Innovation that you -- is 
unbelievable. I don™t know if that
 interested you, but I want to 
tell you, the -- my math -- can I imagine I™m st
udying architectural engineering, I™m trying to 
cheat on ma th. I mean to tell you, it™s mi nd boggling. But my professor of ma th, he liked me  a 

lot. He took such a personal interest in me , that
 if I would ditch classes,
 he would take a Como 
paper and see what movi e I™d be hiding, and actually
 after classes, he would come  in the movie, 
dig me  out and give me  a big speech, aren™t you 
ashame d, your father is
 working on the bicycle 
selling the soap from one little 
town to the other so you can go
 to the school, and -- and he 
flunked me . And he tutor me  the whole summer 
for free. You cannot be engineer if you don™t 

know the math. Til the last test. Now, we alread
y know we have to leave for America, so we 
figure out I™m going to get at least 
the paper in order so I can con
tinue in the States to get my 
degree. And I know I can never do it, because I k
now it would be a very difficult test. So the 
friend of mi ne who was really [indecipherable] in
 math, and we had at the same time a German 
test, so he was Italian guy who di
 -- his father had a visual optical
 audio store. So I told you what 
-- tell you what I do. You help me to get me tw
o hearing aids, and I will help you with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
86 
 
 
German test. So he brought me bunch of wire, I si
t in the last row and I run a wire through my 
sleeve, through the steam pipe down in the baseme
nt, and I had a little mi ke in my hand, and my 
fa -- my friend down in the boiler room. So as s
oon as he wrote the -- our test on the blackboard, 
I wrote it -- you know, I -- I -- whispered to 
my friend down in the boiler room, it took him 
exactly 10 mi nutes to develop the 
test. And I was so delighted that
 I copied it, now is a problem 
to get out of this gizmo that I 
got. So I took a knife, I cut thewire -- because I was wired clear 
down to the baseme nt, and once you go ahead and 
-- and I was so excite
d that I send my -- 
instead of hanging to the paper and breaking my hea
d, blah, blah, blah, I turn
 it to him. And then 
my pr -- my fres -- my professor, and he l
ooked at me , he says, ﬁZdenko, are you sure you™re 
done?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah I™m done.ﬂ He 
se -- he let me  go. Rest of th
em took additional hours. Now 
ca -- we come  back to the class and he sa
ys, ﬁYou know, guys, I™m e mbarrassed. You took one 

hour, two hours, here Mr. Bergl, 
45 mi nutes. Now Mr. Bergl is a smart guy, he™s going to come  
to the blackboard and show us 
how he done it.ﬂ That™s the end of the show. Flunked me. There 
were ma de a -- ma ke up exam in September, and one month later, was November we were on the 

way for America. But he -- he 
helped me  enough to pass the te
st. Now fast forward 25 years 
later, I™m comi ng to Como. I invite my professor 
for lunch with my father and my mother. Meet 

my wife. And my professor tell me , he says, 
ﬁZde nko, I™m teaching there for 45 years, I know 
the kids cheat. Please, how did you 
do it? ﬂ  And then I told him.  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: 25 years later he waited to te
ll him how I cheated. Now I come  to the States, I coul dn™t st art 
right away back to the school because I couldn
™t speak English, not one word. I enroll in the 
engli -- English classes through the Jewish social 
services, and then the army ca me , and my both 
-- both folks got sick, my mother and father, and 
they got the co -- help through the Re d Cross, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
87 
 
 
with the commitment that when I co me up fr om 
service we will pay it back. So when I come 
back, forget about the school, I had to go wo
rk because I had about -- in 1943, I had the 5,000 
dollar worth of debt. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: So I had to go back to work, and I -- I had to
 choose a profession, because I didn™t want to go 
have to work some  ma nual labor or some th
ing. So some body suggests why don™t you go in some  
high technical field that is gr
owing, heating and cooling. And th
en I went, join the labor union, 
and went on apprenticeship program, and I ma de
 a good living doing this, was very happy with 
it. And I never turn back to -- 

Q: The school? 

A: -- the school because it took me too long -- no
w I was already 26 years old, so I wasn™t about 
to go he -- back -- 

Q: But I suppose in some ways we™re all lucky 
that you didn™t go back 
to school with all your 
cheating. 

A: Well, to me -- to -- to -- the fact  it is that  I 
was clever enough that I re
alized that you want to 
become  a good -- you had to have a -- be good with the ma th. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I realized that 
I will never be  good in math. I will do
 -- be good in lots of things, but 
ma th is not my thing. So I said why should I be a bad architect? 

Q: Right, right. 

A: You know, because there™s no future in it. Bu
t they should give you one funny thing -- in the 
same school that I went in Como, I met lots of 
guys til the day that I had to depart for America. 
Eight months ago I™m reading on my  internet Co
mo paper every night. So some body™s writing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
88 
 
 
some thing about American who went to Como, is 
[indecipherable] and some  of the m like it. And 
I write to the Como -- to -- to 
-- to the newspaper, I says, you know
, I was raised in Como, I went 
to the school in Como, and to me  to come  to Eu
rope and not to visit Como are like going to a 
candy store and don™t buy candy. And I signed my na
me . Next day I get a phone call from a guy 
who graduate from the thing, become a very fa
mous architect in Como. He told me , ﬁZdenko, 
you were in school with me .ﬂ And I was supposed 
to meet him this year, I was supposed to be 
ma tter of fac t , this month in Italy. It di dn™t work out because my wife caught pneumonia this 

winter. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So we couldn™t go. But the guy --
 I didn™t hear from hi m from 1949.  
Q: Amazing, isn™t it? 

A: And -- and he read my name
, he recognized right away -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- he say, you know who I am, sa ys yes. He sa
id, my na me is Berlusconi, and -- and I have 
my own company, my son is working with me
. He said he™s also graduate techni 
[indecipherable] school, and I have 
a little piccolo azinda. 
It™s like a small enterprise that we are 
running, me  and my son. So it™s -- it™s funny. 
Q: That™s a great story, 
hopefully you™ll see him.  
A: Ju -- yeah. So it just show you -- 

Q: Tell me  about your meeting 
with Evelyn in Cinecitta. 
A: Cinecitta. 

Q: Cinecitta. 

A: Cinecitta. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
89 
 
 
Q: Cinecitta. 
A: We ll, every -- it was a little group [indeciphe
rable] Jewish yentas. Now you know what™s a 
yenta. She™s going to probably come and ask me to
 spell yenta. That wa
s my mother, Wi nkler™s 
mother, Evie™s mother, and all that
, that in front of the building th
ey were living is a little park 
with the benches. So all those ladies in their 
leisure time, under these pine trees, they we re 
observing the traffic, who is comi ng, who is 
coming, who is waiting, who -- who is cheating on 

who. They were like a executive committee. And Evie
, of course was always -- her mother keep 
a very close eye on her, where she is going. And I 
was hanging with Evie™s brother, with this 
Wi nkler and all of them. And my onl y job in Cineci
tta is ma ke to Evie mi serable. And we -- like 
we went to a beach, and Evie™s la
ying on the beach with clothes on. I went to kiss her, she went 
ballistic. And I didn™t kiss her in any roma ntic wa
y, I just know that she™s going to be pissed, and 
it worked. And you know, as long as we were in Cin
ecitta, I absolutely wa s roma ntic. Only later 
when Evie left for America, after I wa s alrea
dy going to school in Como, and I never thought 
that we are going to ma ke a conne
ction again. It happened purely 
accidentally because when we 
arrive in New York, we ek before Thanksgiving, or
 few days before, of 1949, Evie said that -- I 
don™t know how she tell the story how we me t. 
The fact it is the ﬁNew York Times,ﬂ ran a 
picture of my fa mily in the front page, like an 
[indecipherable] with the 
valise, cardboard valise, 
the refugee for Naples, because most of refugee comi ng to New York were from Bremenhaven. 

We were from Naples. So they have us there, 
it just purely accidental. And Evie™s mother saw 
the pict ure, and then she start calling Jewish se
rvices, and we didn™t continue for Kansas City 

because my Uncle Radon was living already in Ne
w York. So we were his housegue sts for two 

weeks. And as soon as she find out that we are 
living in Manhattan, Heinz, Evie™s brother come  
to pick us up and the first Thanksgiving in Ame r ica, we passed it with Evie and his family. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
90 
 
 
then I went to the army. Now, when I went to th
e army, and I didn™t keep in touch with them -- I 
visited them occasiona lly, New Yor k with her br other, but nothing, nothing, nothing to do with 
Evie. When I was drafted, like year 
and half later, and I™m in Fort
 Lee, Virginia, in the desert  
training, every weekend we go -- jumped in the 
car -- ma tter of fact, you know, in army post you 
have this Saturday morning parade, and I figur
e a way how to beat this parade. Wa s a Brooklyn 
Jewish kid, his name  wa s Marda from Brooklyn, he
 had the car. So Marda we go to Brooklyn, I 
get a ride, he says, you get a ride if you go to th
e first sergeant and you get a pass for me . And I 
come  very good with the first sergeant, he -- he 
-- his name  was Ara Bernasconi. Italian guy. So I 
was kind of -- got thick with him, and I didn™
t have no problem getting passes. Problem it was 
get out of the parade Saturday morning so
 you could not leave til noon. And if you leave 
Saturday noon for New York, Saturday™s gone. 
So I started a limp -- you know, during the -- I 
don™t know if you™re familiar with
 the parade, it™s so funny. When 
you go in front of the review 
stand and the guy say, eyes right, so everybody st
art eyes right, and you do too, I start limping. 
So I broke the whole cadence, can you imagin
e? All the guys going the step, I start limping. So 
the viewing general told the camp commander, so 
he said, ﬁThat™s kid is sick, why you ma ke him 
ma rch? ﬂ So he talked to my first sergeant. He
 said, ﬁOkay, sir, I will 
fix it up, I™m not going to 
let him ma rc h no more.ﬂ I was out. You know?   

Q: So you -- so you didn™t? 

A: Ah, yeah. And -- and I took Martin with me . So
 he had the car and we
 went every Saturday, 
already seven o™clock we  were on the way to Ne
w York, through the New Jersey turnpike, wump 
-- you didn™t have all the road
s you have now, and it was ea -- we
 had to go through downtown 
Washington. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
91 
 
 
A: But was no problem at that time  to get it. 
Q: So were you spending time with Heinz and then s -- 

A: Oh, straight to -- I wa s more time at Evie™s h
ouse than mi ne. Then I discover, hey this girl is 

not bad, you know?  And ma ybe while I had a girlfr
iend that I left in 
Italy, not that I was 
roma ntically involved. I was hanging
 out with her brother, and her 
mother was figure it out that 
we would be a good ma t c h. And where I was statione
d -- well, I™m trying to fast forward that, I 
don™t want to. I don™t want to get ahead myself. 
Evie was not interested
 in me , I was more 
interested in Evie at this poi
nt. She had -- a ma tter of fact ha
d a boyfriend [indecipherable]. And 
then I had to leave. I didn™t -- they send me  oversea. 

Q: Right. 

A: And in that period that I was oversea, I 
didn™t have no contact with Evie, I didn -- 
Q: You didn™t write to her? 

A: No, no. I -- very little contac
t with her brother, but -- and my
 friend Winkler was already in 
the States living in Kansas City. And still I didn™
t come  back. And soon as I come  back I went -- 
there was Christma s 1943, her brother inv
ited me  for a New Year™s Eve party. 
Q: You me a n ™53. 

A: ™53, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So I went from -- from Kansas City for Ne
w Year™s Eve party, and I discover a even more 
prettier Evie. And I star
t giving her hard time , and try to 
courting, you know, la -- was a very 
hard thing going because she was not interest ed in me, I think she was mo re interest give me a 

hard time . But her mo m was interested in me , 
and her brother was delighted. And then finally 
went back to Kansas City, and I 
said, look, it™s a very long distan
ce relationship. So I start flying 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
92 
 
 
every two weeks, TWA from Kansas City to Ne
w York. That time you had to fly by the way of 
Chicago, and they had the c
onstellation prope
ller plane. 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: So it took you six hours. And then I -- I 
rushed from work, I arrived in New York 
International, her brother pick me  up. She is
 watching Brooklyn Dodgers, doesn™t even say hello. 

She ignored [indecipherable] not 
only she didn™t pick me  up. I said
 what the hell I™m doing here? 
And she -- I talk to [indecipherabl
e] Carl Furillo and Roy Campane
lla, I -- I reme mbe r  a few of 
those name s from the Brooklyn Dodgers. 

Q: Right. 

A: She was such a baseball fan. Right now she co
uldn™t care less, but that
 time she was a big fan 
[indecipherable]. But I was doing it on every two w
eek basis, and that become  very expensive. I 
was in the hock in a ma tter of six months to TWA some thing like 3500 bucks. 1953. 

Q: And your intention wa s to see her -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and her intention wa s to -- 

A: Her intention to avoid me. And I wou -- then 
finally when she upse -- accepted to marry me, I 
said we will do it down the line lik
e 12 months, another year or some  [indecipherable] two years. 
And I told her, you know, that will not work. Y
ou can stretch it as long as you want, but I cannot 
fly [indecipherable] to New York. 
And when she be -- we fast forward what that we got ma rried 
the following Fourth of July. And that™s year -- th
at was the end of the picnic for Evie, then she 
got stuck. 

Q: So did you just wear her down? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
93 
 
 
A: I think I did to a certain poi
nt wear her down, yes. But you know wha t  the funny thing is the -
- when I was in Japan, and I was thinking ofher because when I was [indecipherable] in 
Virginia, she was looking pretty good to me . At
 a certain point I writ
e to her and say, you know, 
I would like to have with you a 
little more meani ngful relations
hip. And if you keep putting off, 
you don™t have to -- I don™t care
. I got a different girlfriend 
in Italy. [indecipherable]  
Q: Right. 

A: What do you think was her a-answer? 

Q: Go ahead, ma rry her. 

A: That™s what she said. The funny part it is that 
we were ma rried already th
ree, four years, and I 
have the picture of Italian girl
 in a kimono that I send her from
 Tokyo. And I have it in a frame 
behind Evie picture, Evie is in the front. And 
she is living with me  now
 already three years. 
Q: And she doesn™t [indecipherable] 

A: And she doesn™t know the gir -- til one day 
she was cleaning and dusti
ng the picture. When 
she found that picture behind hers, sh -- oh, that 
was -- I think that was the biggest fight I had 
with her since our ma rriage.
 Really, really upset.  
Q: Did you reme mber that that picture was there? 

A: No, completely forgot. 

Q: You forgot? 

A: Completely forgot. Co mpletely. But that™s
 one of the -- you know, 
one th -- one of the 
episode.  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
94 
 
 
A: But the friendship that we develop in this gr
oup, like Wi nkler that I me ntion several time, and 
his brother-in-law that was runni
ng the kitchen, we become  such 
a tight group that it continue. 
Because Wi nkler st art working for Joint in Rome. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we become  like Elkia Eliskovich, which wa
s general manager of Joint for Rome in Italy, 
which was picked up by the office in Paris, whic
h was running whole ref
ugee thing in Europe. 
She liked Winkler, and she put him under her wing. She didn™t know how young was the 

Wi nkler, but after awhile -- now I™m -- I™m alr
eady in Como -- and she said, ﬁYou know, Henry, 
I™m go o -- I need to open office in Milan. How would you like to run my office in Milan? ﬂ And 

Wi nkler figure I™m in Como, you got a deal. A
nd within two months 
Wi nkler and the whole 
fa mily was in Como with us. And he was commuting every day to Milan. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he is the guy who put us, you know, to go 
-- when the all papers come , were supposed to 
come, he™s -- I wanted to go the same place wh
ere he goes. So Wi nkler was -- drawed the 
[indecipherable] Kansas City. And we couldn™t switc
h it, so we -- we both agreed to Kansas City 
and then Wi nkler father got sic
k, he couldn™t leave with us at the same  time . And then I brought 
him back. I send him papers and the money to come  to America in 1952, before I went to the 

army. 

Q: Before you went to the army, yeah. When -- wh
en you discovered after the war, the extent of 

the brut ality and the murder in Europe, was th
at -- that must have been shocking to you. 

A: Yes. We know that was lots 
of people dying, but th-the horror 
of the wa y those people were 
deported, the -- wi -- nobody knew exactly wh
at was going [indeciphe
rable] war but not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
95 
 
 
completely going. The thing only come  out whe n
 I start meeting lots of those people who 
survived the camps, and their 
story, more than the press. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Even told the ﬁStars and Stripes,ﬂ -- that  was 
an army news paper, they
 didn™t co -- didn™t hide 

it, they really brought the atroc
ity the way they were. And then
 yes, we were all surprised, 
because we couldn™t believe such inhu ma n -- in
hu manity is possible. We didn™t know what 
happened in Jasenovac. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- til after the war. We  know that people got
 killed, but the way, I 
mean, not-- Croatia Nazi 
were worse than the German Nazis. I mean, th
ey were absolutely i
nhumanely vicious. Dying 
every -- you know, you are dead, you™re dead, but 
those guys what they done, the way they killed 
the people is absolutely horrendous what they done. 

Q: Yeah. And when it -- when you thought about 
that, there you were 
living, it sounds like, a 
very privileged, protected life -- 

A: No question about it. 

Q: -- in Ital y. 

A: No question. 

Q: And here -- if you had se -- 

A: You -- the -- it cou -- woul
d -- would boggle our mi nd that some thing possible like this to 
happen. Even Italians -- even Italian Fascists -- Fa
scists, hard core Fascis
ts couldn™t believe it. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: If you were not in it, you know, when Ger man -- 
I believe that the Germ
an, as overall, didn™t 
know what was going in camp, to the extent thatit happened. They know they were killing Jews. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
96 
 
 
And they know there were camps there, ev
en they said they didn™t know. But nobody can 
imagine what is happening. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Nobody, because they ca -- they the -- at least -- 
at least [indecipherabl e] there were Jews in 
charge of extermination of Jews. 
This is special group of people. 
Q: Do you consider yourself a survivor?   

A: I -- I -- I think -- I don™t [indeci pherable] conc
ept to put it. Yes, I™m definitely a survivor, 
privileged survivor. 

Q: Mm. 

A: No question about it. When I hear what happe
ned to other people -- we had it so ma ny close 
calls it was really mi nd-boggling how come  we didn'
t fall in the trappies of this phone call -- i -- 
of this close call that we had. But the way I liv
ed, the way we survive
d, the privileges we had. 
The shower, warm water, food. I mean, come  on - -  
Q: Right. 
A: -- I mean, when I hear about the -- Evie in 
the caves, just few miles down the road from me , 
where I was leading relatively
 good, dangerous but good and safe 
-- not safe, comfortable life, 
then you know, it™s terrible thing wh
at she went through it as a young kid. 

Q: Right. 

A: I™m never -- you know, I was never to exposed
 it. Not -- you know, it™s a different thing 
eating and eating good. And we were 
eating good. I mean, you know --  
Q: You weren™t just surviving. 

A: No, we were not just surviving, by all mean
s. So -- and I become  such a [indecipherable] 
Italian, on a general thing, because you got a 
good people, a ba d people in any group. But the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
97 
 
 
Italian al ways -- i-in the majorit
y, as a people, they™re 
unbelievable people. It
alians jealous, they 
envious people. Like if you were 
very wealthy in Italy, they coul
d be jealous about your wealth. 
You don™t have nothing -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- they will gi ve you the shirts off their back. Now you wi ll find occasi onally somebody, 

Italians are always worrying, they™re always hoa
rding because they never think is enough. What 

happened to Evie, when those farmer, they woul
d like to give her food, 
but they figure ma ybe 
tomorrow they will need it, because they are not sure. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not that they want to see 
her hungry, but that™s how some  It
alian -- sometimes the Italians 
work. Is not always even handed. 

Q: Right. We need to change the tape. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: I wanted to ask you about your pa
rents. Did they get sick right wh
en you went to Korea, or is 
this before?  
A: That the only time that my father -- oh e 
-- oh, excuse me , you™re talking about sick. 
Q: Yes. 

A: My father got sick while I was in Korea. 

Q: And they both got sick at the same time? 

A: Yeah, m- my mother had the acute pa
ncreitis and my father heart attack. 
Q: Really? 

A: And my mother was fighting this
 cute --  acute pancreitis til the 
day she died. A ma t t er of fact, 
I reme mber that a physician come  and told us --
 I almost knocked him right on his tutu -- tell me  
-- she goes tell my father -- h-he did, he said, 
ﬁYou know, she got ma ybe two, three days left.ﬂ 
She lived til she was 96. 
Q: Ninet -- 96 years old, she was -- 
A: Yeah. And I say, how can you 
tell the heart patient -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: You see, what happened that the regular 
family doctor was not available. He was on a 
vacation. He was the guy who operate on her, 
her surgeon [indecipherable]. So the only one 

available in Menora Hospital in Kansas City to 
see her, was him. But you figure he™s a surgeon, 
he should know enough about the panc
reas, blah, blah. So he told he
r what a critical thing he did. 
And she use pancreatinis 
me dicine on a regular basis, she di
dn™t have no problem with it. So 
that™s the period, yeah, they happen -- they
 were sick while I was in the army -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
99 
 
 
A: -- and the -- now don™t forget, once I got United
 States army, Joint -- Jewish welfare was 
through giving you support. They were obliged for fi
ve years, but once the army took over, then 
it™s the Red Cross duty.  
Q: Really? 

A: The Red -- yeah, Red Cross is a back-up for Amer
ican service, for all the branches of service. 

So Jewish welfare didn™t do nothing to -- with th
em no more. Then the Red Cross come in there. 
Q: And they helped your parents? 

A: Yeah. They di -- supported them til I didn -- co
me home. But they told me ahead that they 
was going to expect to me at one point -- 

Q: To pay it back. 

A: -- to go pay it back. They don™t ma ke any ti
me table, but said, you know
, they helping other 
people, whatever you give us back is going to 
help some body out tomorrow. And we felt morally 
obligated to return this money. 
Q: Right, sure. 
A: And I figure longer I wait, hard
er it is going to be, so I fi
gure I™m going to get a good job. 
And I -- that -- so I pi cked up -- 

Q: And that™s when you went to -- 

A: -- yeah, go in the trade, and I 
paid it off quite --  relatively quite fast, I paid him back within 
three years. 

Q: Wow. And your father, did he ma intain 
his health after that
 first hear
t attack? 
A: My father lived in -- he lived, God bless hi
m, he had a two heart attack, he had a cancer 
surgery and -- a-and after the surgery, he live additional 12 years.  

Q: Hm. And your mother lived much longer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
100 
 
 
A: My mother, yeah. 
Q: So you were all living together? 

A: We were living -- we -- I never left my p -- 
when -- when -- when the Nazi come  to Zabno, 
my aunt ma r r ied to the doctor told my fa
mily, listen, I™m protected, I™m not worry. Leave 
Zdenko with me . I would never left my parents 
for one single second. And I never said -- even 
through all the time I was married, that my parents 
live with me . I always give them the courage, 
the honor, to say I™m 
living with them. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I give my credit to my wife. I t  is not
 easy to go ahead and live with mother-in-law as 
many years she does. But my wife was very smart.
 For loss of the privacy, she ha -- got a butler 
and a cook. We left for the morning -- in the morn
ing, we didn™t ma ke the bed, we didn™t have to 
worry what is for supper. We  know we are cu -- 
we  went in a gourme t restaurant every day til 
they were able to cook and take
 care of us. We  di dn™t shop for grocery. My father does the -- 
everything. If he had any wishes, if I would sa
y listen, Mother, ma ke me  Punschtorte -- you 
know what™s a Punschtorte? 

Q: No. 

A:  That™s a brandy 
cake that I love -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- also Viennese. Or ma ke me  Sach
er torte, or Dobish torte, or -- 
Q: So you do -- 

A: Pish -- n-not only -- or Cremeschnitten, wh
ich are Napoleon. I mean, s he was fa mo us for it. 
That™s how she got job in the American. And she 
was still -- she cooked 
-- she died 96, but she 
was still active in
 kitchen at 92. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
101 
 
 
Q: No kidding? 
A: Yeah. So that was a payback for loss of the privacy.  

Q: Right. 

A: Thank God our house was big enough. So, you were -- enough space.  

Q: Right. 

A: But why my -- my wife is so brilliant that
 she ma de a me nt al rule
, never be in kitchen 
together with my mother.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And whe n my mother was not capable no mo
re to cook in, my wife took over cooking. She 
was sitting in her Lazy Boy chai
r and observing in the k
itchen, every mo ve, to 
the point that Evie 
got so upset that she closed the door, because 
her eyes were following every step she we nt.  
Q: Right. 

A: And then we had a -- as other -- as a pay -- 
payoff for me  not going to 
live in New York, that 
her parents came at least twice a year. And I l
oved to have them, because when I -- those two 
cooks together, what I would te
ll my mother I would like to ha
ve a germtike cooking. You know 
what a germtike? 

Q: Mm- mm.  

A: That™s a -- germ is a yeast. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I like a yeast sweet, made with yeast. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And my mom -- my mother-i
n-law had a -- when she ma de some thing with chocolate, you 
know you are a chocolate eater. My mother w
ould put [indecipherable] in chocolate -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
102 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- in yeast. My mother -- when you eat, 
it was dripping on you. So I ma de them compete 
against each other, I was sitting b
ack there and laughing. Wa s  fantastic. 

Q: But that™s an unusual set-up that you -- 

A: Very unusual set-up, and it worked. I used to 
fi ght with my mother-in-law that you would not 
believe  it, because my mother-in- law was a very strong willed person. But she was not grudge 

holding person. I could have a big screaming ma t c h 
and [indecipherable] sai
d, ﬁMa, I™m ready to 
go out, you ready? ﬂ In five mi nutes she™s in the 
car with me . She loved to go in the car. Five 
mi nutes, all the argument, forget it. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I loved her. She was really a rema rkable
 woman. I -- I really l
oved her [indecipherable]. 
And she would bring, you know, my nephews, with her --    

Q: Yes. 
A: -- when we could not afford yet for them 
to fly, they would come  with the Greyhound bus 
with two kids. It™s a long schlep. It is a l ong, believe me , but she would faithfully they would 
come  to Kansas City to visit. I mean, the kids l
oved it, and I loved to have
 them, it was really --  it 
was very interesting arrangeme nt, you know.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When did you retire? 

A: I retired about 12 years ago. But the -- to the 
-- you want me  to tell yo
u about the story about 
my car.  

Q: Yeah, I will, but wait a second. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
103 
 
 
A: Okay. 
Q: Before -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: When -- have you -- did you at one point deci
de that you would talk to kids about the 
Holocaust or not? 

A: To -- to my nephews, you mean? 

Q: We ll, either to your ne
phews, or to schoolchildren? 
A: No, I -- I never discussed th
e Holocaust with them, and I™ll 
tell you exactly why. We  had so 
ma ny volunteer Polish that liked to talk about 
Holocaust, and we -- and I got some  of friends 
which are Hungarians, and I know that the Hunga
rian Jews know very little about Holocaust. 
Because when most of Jews who we re dead, Hunga
rian were still in B
udapest til 1945. So they 
come  on too late. It is true  they paid a dear price,
 because Hitler had to ge t rid of them very fast. 
Now, the other Jews, if they young and strong, they had a chance to work in the camp, or some  
labor. But Hungarian Jews, he was trying to kill 
them fast as he can because Hitler was running 
out of time. But when those Hungarian Jews 
who didn™t go to the camp was pick up by the 
Holocaust -- Holocaust, and explained the horror 
of it, and didn™t e
xperience it, they are 
hypocrite. So I felt if I would go try to go ahea
d, how can I compare my suffering with those 
people who come from Poland, so -- from other 
country, they already -- 
or Austria?  So, it was 
not my place to speak there. I was invited, as a 
matter of fact, to speak 
to a Jewish retire group 
next month on 14, which are doctors and the engin
eers and lawyers in Ka nsas City, about again, 
survival in Italy, the Italian Alp. But that™s a di
fferent chapter, because they were never -- they 
never any -- any idea. But I w
ould never be presumptuous enough 
to explain the horror of the 
camp, because I were not there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
104 
 
 
Q: No, no, I -- I al -- I meant, would you 
-- were you asked to talk about Italy? 
A: Nobody -- 
Q: I mean most people don™t 
even think about Italy, right? 
A: No, no, nobody. 

Q: Right. 

A: This is what be -- upset me  more than you 
can believe. They buried this fact, all they know 
Mussolini, and the Fascist, and r -- 
and that™s all they know. It is so
 much behind the surface, that 
is not fair to Italians pe r se, as a whole, you know, because you cannot -- you don™t have  a -- 

you™ve got bad Jews, too, you™ve got Jews who we
re putting other Jews in
 the [indecipherable] 
in the -- in the -- in the crematory. So -- 
but you cannot ma ke gene
ralize. You know, you got 
exception to every situation. I don™t think the guy
 was shoveling body in the -- i-in the damn h-
high temperature to be burned, that he done it beca
use he hate the Jews, he
 was trying to survive. 
Q: Right. 
A: So h-he -- is all depend from wha t  percep
tion and what concept you are looking at it. But I 
did -- they did ask me  to speak to schoolchildre
n, and -- and is very inte
resting, and I can tell 
you, Kansas City, I™m very proud to have invita
tion all over. And all th
e right religious group, 
they ma ke sure that Holocaust is not forgotten. 
It is amazing. Right now in Kansas City we have 
a third generation of Holocaust survivors speakin
g about it. We have -- those guys some thing in 
common with me , they were not the camp, eith
er. But they were privileged to say my 
grandfather. I don™t have that. S
ee, except for my -- one of my  
mother brothers, who got caught 
in Split, like I told you [indecipherable]  
Q: Right. 

A: Nobody else got burned in this Holocaust. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
105 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Now, my  father™s side, in Serbia, they™re ki
lling the first four days the Nazi got in Serbia. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: First four days. 

Q: Serbia wa s a rough [indecipherable] 

A: Nobody on my father™s side survive. Nobody. 

Q: Nobody? 

A: Nobody. Nobody. 

Q: So he was alone. 

A: He was -- when the war finished, the only Bergl 
is left  al ive. And ther
e were four brothers, no 
sisters, four brothers. Rema rkable
 thing it is, by the Jewish community where I have i-in Croatia, 
that there we re very few Jews in comparison to 
other countries. But th 
-- all very successful 
Jews. I would say is, in Croatia 
that 80 percent of Jews were self-employed in some  kind of 
business, along with 20 percent working for some
body, or for some  enterprise. And then a -- in 
most of community, wherever they
 live, th-the excellent relations
hip with Jews. It was not an 
animosity like Poland that when you go in frontof church you went pah, pah, pah. That didn™t 

[indecipherable] but it -- it was a 
very, very tight relationship, ri
ght through the whole country, 
even Bosnia. Now, you had some  Je ws here [i
ndecipherable] you have in -- do you have them 
here too? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You have a Jewish [indecipherable] in Israel. 
But as a whole that we 
could really feel?  No, 
no, no. 

Q: Right. Were you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
106 
 
 
A: You know -- 
Q: Yeah [indecipherable] 

A: -- excuse me , I want to tell you some thing which is amazing.  

Q: Mm. 

A: And is a compli me nt to the Jewish race. From 1947, through 1955, now I™m -- I™m giving you 

this window because 1955 include Hungarian revol
ution, when Hungarian Jews start comi ng to 
United States. In this period in Kansas City
 come  270 fa milies. From hodgepodge of all the 
countries. Almost all of them were self-empl
oyed. I wouldn™t say more than 15 percent was in 
group like me, working or learning 
-- but not big enterprise, some
 more, some less. Some of 
them i mmensely successful. But what I™m trying to
 bring a point about the welfare. We all went  
to the school from first day we arrive, to learnEnglish, working at nighttime . I restrain from any 

group comi ng in the United States want to change
 the system, or improve the different language 
in our educational system. I don™t 
care from what country you co
me . If you want to preserve 
your heritage , f-fine. You want to teach your kids
 so they are bilingual, fantastic. But don™t me ss 
around with a system that works. That™s why we 
went to this school. And sa -- same  J e ws now, 
they were they -- they were 
-- you know, I had th -- have th
e blessing of advanced learning, 
education, faculty and all of them. M ost Jews in
 Kansas City, they were so illiterate, and so 

Jewish oriented, if they picked up ﬁKansas City St
arﬂ in their hand, it didn™t
 have a picture, they 
will hold it upside down. Can I tell you more than
 that? Only Hebrew. And yet, every one of 
their kids is college graduate. From
 surgeons to doctor to engineers,
 to professional -- is absol -- 
mi nd-boggling. So it is a land of opportunity. Those 
pi -- you know, those pa
rents are so ignorant 
in comparison to their kids and grandchildren, is
 mi nd-boggling. But they were willing to work. I 
don™t care what work they performe d. They we
re very, very successful what they were doing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
107 
 
 
Never on welfare. I don™t know a single Jewish in
 Kansas City that™s 
went on welfare. They 
accepted from Jewish community to get started onl
y, but every one of them was very anxious to 
go on. I don™t know anybody who did not send their ki
ds to college. I neve
r see -- every si -- 
every one of our friends, the kids 
have. And some  of them from pr
estigious universities. So it is 
some thing in willingness to work. Jews are not lazy people. And they have a hump to pick up 
and go from nothing.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, even to this day, when I sociali
ze with my friends, and 
I know they are much 
smarter than they are. I mean, bias to show how
 much smarter I am than they are. Inst ead of 
bringing them down, I bring myself, lots of times 
to thei r level. I™m more comfortable with it. 

And -- and sometime when I say something tremendous
ly stupid, I don™t want to ma ke them feel 
that way. I try to explain as gently as
 possible where they ma king a mi stake.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And I™m very proud of my heritage wher
e I am, and I cannot emphasize enough. I™m not a 
very religious person, I™m not 
a very observant person, belong to a shul. We don™t go there 
[indecipherable] not even [indecipherable] imagination as mu ch as the shul. But we, you know, 
with the Je wish holiday, we try to be part of 
it, we observe the Jewish holiday, always so meplace 

for New Ye ar™s Eve, or the other Jewish holidays.
 But heritage is very important. And I -- I -- I 
tell you, Evie had lots to do with it, because sh
e come from Vienna, from different, much more 
Jewish surrounding than I do. I was dabbling so
 much -- that™s why I had such a close 

relationship with my Gentile friend in Croatia. 
It was beautiful. You know, when they write to 
me  for holidays, send us ma tches. I™m sending ma tche
s all over Croatia, they love it. When the -- 
when is a -- they don™t know when ho
ly day, when is the ma tches season?

Q: Right. You wanted to tell us a stor
y about bringing your Cadillac to Croatia.  
A: We ll, see, when I left, when I was not quite 13 -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- my dream it was -- when you lost everything. I mean, everything my father worked. I said 

one day I™m going to come  back and show thesepeople the Bergl family still got some thing. So 

as soon -- when I go -- bought my first car, and a 
-- I left in 1941, and di
dn™t return til ™72. 31 
years pass. And I say I have to ma ke a bi
g entrance when I come . I did some  still 

[indecipherable] ship™s traffic between New York
. I had a friend who mi gh
t drive my car in New 
York, I -- my f -- parents loved to travel by ship. 
So they took a car with them on the ship, me  
and Evie, we flew to Genoa. We  sit down in th
e car, I put American flag on my antenna, and I 

drive in my hometown. Within 10 minut
es the word spread, Je w is back. 

Q: Jew is back? 

A: Yeah, Jew is b -- not in a derogatory ma nner,
 you mean -- s-so they co
me  to us, says listen, 
we took everything away from you, you didn™t have 
nothing. How did you do it?  So I said listen, 
it™s very simple. We  apply to go to America.
 Once we arrived in New York, the Jewish 
committee from New York waited for us. Give us a 
key from the car, give us a key for the house 
[indecipherable] is in the book. They says, here 
with us, you™re welcome to America. And the 
guy say, you kidding. I said, no, it™s very simple, 
all you have to be Jewish, hand you everything. 

Jews are waiting for you with -- to give you stuff.
 And the guy -- those farmer were just shaking 
their head. Should I tell them they arrive in 
America sweeping floor?  Would that impress him?  
No. And I wanted to do the impact, and it worked
. And they bought it. They actually believed it. 
Q: Did you ever tell them that wasn™t true? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
109 
 
 
A: Never te -- never told them. 
We ll, later on they could s -- 
draw their own conclusion through 
the years, because I came ma ny ti me s back, with 
a little later on confusi
on because I didn™t take 
my car, but I rented the car, one time  a Mercedes
, one time a Volvo. So I come there all different 
cars in -- you know, when I came to my home town. But 
this first -- I wanted to ma ke a splash the 
first time I came. 

Q: Well, you certainly made one. 

A: And I di -- with Ame r ican flag, y-you 
don™t [indecipherable] you don™t have any idea, 
communist Yugoslavia and I™m have the guts to fl
y American flag. I™m -- when I was driving to 
capital of Zagreb, the police stop and pa -- let 
me  pass, they thought I was American embassy. 
That big -- like [indecipherable], there™s nowhere
 to put me . On tollbooth
 they didn™t know to 
charge me  as a car or as a bus, it was so huge. 

Q: This was a Cadillac in 1972? 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And whe r e did you put the flag, in the front? 
A: On antenna. 

Q: On the antenna? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Very clever. And Evie was in the car? 

A: Evie -- my whole fa mily -- 

Q: And your fa -- your family? 

A: -- oh, oh, you kidding, when we go -- that™s I te
ll you, when the word spread that, know that 
when I say Jew come  to town, it means Je
w, the guy that we took everything from. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499

A: You know, we left, they took everything from 
me . And they start asking me  -- then I come  
with this bull story, to tell th
em how we acquire all the -- and 
-- and that™s funny because I stay 
for about one week. I -- I have to tell you other stor
y about this thing. When I™m driving with this 
Cadillac from Zagreb to my home town, and you 
go through lots of small town, and you got still 
far mer, they use oxen to pull the hay. 
Q: Right. 

A: And like they would go over there,
 take the hay in mi ddle of the field, hi -- hi -- farmer is in 
front of the oxen, and he goes to the field to hi
tch the wagon to take it back t -- you understand? 
So -- and I can™t move because the oxen go slow
. And [indecipherable] the grill on my Cadillac 
[indecipherable] to fit from the [indecipherable]
 when one of [indeciphe
rable] on my hood on my 
car. I was cleaning for two days with tooth and 
brush. So I -- from now on, whenever I go from 
Croatian town, plenty room
 between me  and my car. 
Q: You and the ox. 
A: Yeah. But was a big experience,
 a great satisfaction, believe me . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, I had the blowout on 
the Italian outerstrada because 
we™re going pretty fast. And 
finding a tire for a Cadillac, spare tire, is almo
st impossible, til I come -- call -- call American 
embassy. So I said, you know, I am l ooking for --
 he says, oh -- the guy told me , he said, no 
problem, we  got plenty tire 
in our -- all our ca -- Cadill
acs on our staff, and we are 
[indecipherable] in our embassy. Come  over here. 
I went to American embassy, they gave me  a 
tire, I si gn a sheet. Two months later I got a bill fr om State department for the tire. 

Q: Hm. But you didn™t have an accident. 

A: Wa  -- no, no, no accide nt, no, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
111 
 
 
Q: No, no, no. 
A: It was -- I was not 
-- I was not always doing, it just happe
ned that from the speed and load, I 
wa -- we were carrying -- see, I had the carrier on
 top of -- was temporary carrier with the straps. 
From the speed, the carrier broke. And in one bo
x, I had like 200 neckties. When those neckties 
broke loose, the box hit the highway, and on the side
 of the road were olive trees. Those trees 
were decorate like Christ ma s tree with the neckties. 

Q: With the neckties. So -- 

A: Yes. But it was experience. One time  I y -- 
I was happy [indecipherable] and at that time was 
cheap, was 500 dollar round trip
 to Italy with my car. 
Q: Wow, fa bulous. 

A: It was worth it, every penny of it. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: And there were -- my folks came back, there I flew to New York, I picked them up, and I 
drove the car and then 
back to Kansas City. 
Q: Right. Well, it™s quite an ending. 
A: Now that was -- that wa -- tha-that was about
 the most glorious return home  I can have, 
despite that I return ma ny other times, and I ha
ve very dear friend and family. I cannot en -- 
equal my first come home. 

Q: Come -- time, yeah, right. 

A: Nothing. Because they really thought that 
they got us down, and they figure they didn™t. 
Q: And you™ve gone back to Italy a number of times. 

A: Italy is for me  really more important now -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
112 
 
 
A: -- is important to my  life than Croatia because
 my connec tion with Ital
y not only as a country, 
as a beauty, as in a very, very good friend, you 
know. It is -- it is undescribable how close 
connection we have with some
 of the people in Italy. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And problem with Europe right now the econo
mi c situation it is, be-become  [inde cipherable] 
very expenses. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know. And we a r e retired people, we™re 
living well, but we -- we are never unlimited 
means.  

Q: Right. 

A: And in the past when we trav
el in Europe, we stayed with a
ll the fr iends, they insi sted, the 
fa mily. All that we get would require certain comf ort. 

Q: Right. 
A: You know. To go to visit some body house with
 one bathroom, four or five people in, you 
have to cross hallway to other room to get -- 
the mi ddle of the night, 
you have to get dress -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- you can™t go in your gacekas. 

Q: Right.  

A: You know. So it become  -- it™s no more pleas
ure. If you go in the trip, I don™t need luxury, 
but I need comfort. 

Q: Right. 

A: Otherwise I don™t go. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
113 
 
 
A: And the lee -- l-last but not 
least, most of our friend live on
 second and third floor without 
elevator. And that™s is [indecipherable] 
Q: It™s bu -- yeah, it™s impossible -- 

A: It is not po
ssible to do it. 
Q: -- right, right. 

A: And to go in hotel, a decent hotel today in 
Europe, I don™t care if it™
s Italy or France or 
Germany, is  cost you about 150 to 200 bucks. Modest hotel. 

Q: Right. 

A: I™m not talking about 
Sheraton and Hilton, or -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Carillon in Paris or  some thing like that. Or
 Ritz. Because if you want
 a first class hotel in 
Europe, cost you 600 bucks for a average room. 

Q: Yeah. Right. 
A: And this is a sin. But as long as Ja
panese have the money, sky is limit.  
Q: Right. 
A: Before Japanese in -- inva
sion of -- of Las Vegas, you 
with a nice room for 50 bucks. 
Q: We ll, everythingchanged. 

A: No, I™m t a lking, but it™s a re
ason why they change. But I love America. I™m so proud to be 
American. I become in the Midwest, a redneck American, I™m Democrat. 

Q: But you™re a redneck? 

A: But I am a redneck American. I think -- I think 
so much of this country, that my word will 
never able on this film describe 
how much I think of this country. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0499  
114 
 
 
A: Not only that this the greatest country of the 
earth, and that you have opportunity and that so 
ma ny peopl e take advantage of the system, and the system is full of hole. And the politician, 
some  of the good, some  bad, it is true. We  have co
rrupt, we have a problem,
 but is not better on 
the earth.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because if you compa r e what is any other 
pl ace, you don™t have perfection, you alwa ys have 

flaw. But I can go here in the streets, say wh
at I think without worrying some body shoot me . I 
can go in mi ddle of Wa shington and say hey, Bush
 stink. Try to do that -- go in Germa ny, in 
today in democratic Germany and s a y Helmut Schm
idt stink. Go say in mi ddle of the Rome , in 
front of parliame nt that Berlusco
ni stink. Today, it™s today. Some  of his supports are going to hit 
you in your head. Not in America. You can say 
whatever you want. And I learn -- you know 
where I learn that? I 
learn it when I was in patrol  in Korea, 
and that impr ess me  to this day. I™m a 
-- I™ m with the black guy fr om Little Rock, Arkansas
. He™s a leader of my patrol  squad, and this 
guy is cursing Truman every step. That so and so 
in a warm bed, and wa -- and I™m here in the 
mi ddle, freezing my butt, blah, blah, blah. And my  friend™s sergeant tell him, you can bitch as 

you want, just keep -- and he was carrying BR, you know what™s a BR? 

Q: Mm- mm.  

A: Brownie automa tic rifle. This like a machine gun, weigh about 70 pounds. He was a big dude. 

And the sergeant told him, you can bitch, you can co
mplain, just keep going. Move a little faster. 
That™s America. Try to do that any other arm
y. You cannot do it. So let me  conclude this 
interview with much thanking [indecipherable]
 for you and the whole crew, and God bless 
America. 

Q: Thank you.
