T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hat you are about to hearf rom  

Marcel is one individual's account of the Holocaust.
 
Ma rc e l  D rimer wa
s born in Drohobycz, Poland. The arrow on this map pointsto Poland.  Marcel's 
father, Jacob, worked as an accountant in a lum berf actory while his  m other raised Marceland 

younger sister Irena.  In thisphoto we see Marcel and hism otherLaura in1934. Germ any and the 

Soviet Union attacked Poland in September 1939, beginningW orld W ar II.  T his is an historical 

photographof  Germ an troopsparading throughW arsaw af ter the surrenderof  Poland.  On June 22, 

1941, Germ an violated the pact and attackedSoviet territory. W ithin a few weeks, Drohobycz was 

occupied by Germanforces.  In 1942,m em bers of  Marcel'sfam ily, including his grandfather who we 

see here, were deported to exterm ination cam ps where they were m urdered. Inthef all of 1942 

Marcel and his f
am ily were f orced into the Drohobycz ghetto.  Herewe see anhistorical photograph 
of  Jews beingf orced into the Drohobycz ghetto. 
 
Bef ore the liquidation ofthe get tow thef am ily escapedtoa small vill age.  In August1943Marcel 

went into hiding with a Polish Ukrainianf am ily.  Marcel'sf am ily is seen inthis photo taken in 1947or 

1948f rom  left to right we see Marcel's uncleAbraham  Drimer, hisparents,Laura and Jacob and his 

uncle Abraham Gruber.  In 1957 Marcelearned a degree in mechanical engineer
in g.   He  
im m igrated tothe United States in 1961 where his wif eAnia joined him  in 1963. Soon after arrival in 

the UnitedStates he was hiredby the USpost off ice departm ent towork on the design ofm ail 

sorters and conveyers.   Af ter a very successful pe
riod with the post off ice department, Marcel 

transf erred tothe US Arm y as a civilian in 1972.  Hethen worked asa mechanical engineer for the 

Arm y Corps of  Engineers.  Although
 
Marceloff icially retired f rom the Arm y in 1994 he remained a

m ade recomm endations about their potentialsignif icance tothe exhibit.T hey are quite ateam . 
 
 

Marcel speakspublicly abouthis Holocaust experience in various settings. He was a speaker with 

Mia Farrow at an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, andhe spoke to cadets f rom ourfourm ilitary 

Academ ies who wereon their way to vis it Auschwit z. T wo weeks ago Marcel spoke to studentsand 

faculty at the University of  Virginia and recently at several f ederal agencies including the U.S. 

Departm ent of Agriculture.Next week he'll bespeakto go theArm y. 
 

 

Marcel has recently donated photographs ofgreat signif icance to him as well as a ring whi ch played 

a role inhis survival, which we wi ll hear 
more about today.
 
And with that, I'd like to ask you to join

(Applause)
 
  

Marcel Drim er:  T hank you. 
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, thank you so muchfor joining us today andforyour willin gness to beour
 
F i rs t  
Pe
rs o n
. T hank youfor being here.  Youhave so muchto tell usand we have such a lim ited time, so 
we'll start. W orldW ar II began in September1939 when Germ any attacked Polandf rom  the west 

followed quickly b y the Soviets attacking Polandf rom  theeast. 
 
Early in the war you and yourf am ily 
lived under Russian occupation. But before we turntothe war, tellus a littleabout yourf am ily, 

yourself ,and your comm unity beforethe warbegan.
 
Marcel Drim er:  My f ather, Jacob, was the oldestof f ive siblings and m y mother Laura was the 

oldestof four siblings. They both were born in 1904. And we lived in Drohobycz.  T he town was a 

sm all town, very picturesque town in thefoothills of T ibetanm ountains.  And the Jews, the 

population of  Drohobycz was ability 60, 70,000 people, equally divi ded betweenPoles, Jews, and 

the Ukrainians. The situation in Poland,even bef ore the war, was ge tting a little toughfor being a 

Jew, f or the Jews.  I think that this was the inf luence of the 1933 Hitler's getting to power.  
T here's 

local nationalistsand fascists managed to get
 
--
 
establish a college ghetto. University studentshad 
to sit inthe upper rows of theuniversity.  T here was som ething called numerus claususf orJews to 

attenduniversity.  T here were certain restrictions as toprof ession.T he Jews couldnot be off icers in 

the Polish Arm y, they couldbe privatesand lower rank and COs. 
 
But the situation, when the Germansattacked, as Billm entioned, when the Germans attack Poland 

on September 1, 1939, the
 
--
 
the 17
th of Septem ber Russia attacked Polandf rom  theeast. There

was agreem ent of  non
-
aggression so that Germ ans didnotf ight theRussians against Russians.  
Poland was at thattime divided western Poland becam eunder theGerm an occupationand eastern 
Poland,
 
including Drohobycz, was a part of the Soviet Union.
 
T he situation under the Soviet regim e was quite tough. T hey
 
--
 
if  I could geta little light lowered
 
Bill Benson: I don't know that they can turn thatdown. W hat I tried to do is dom y best tolook d
own 
here.
 
Ma rc e l  D rim e r:   O k a y.
 
Bill Benson: If  they'll do it, they'll do that. 
 
Marcel Drim er: T heywould take away people'sf actory
 
--
 
pri vate factories, bigfarm s, bigbuildings.  
T hey nationalized it.  They senda lot of people to
 
--
 
Polish people and som e Jewish people to 
Siberia. Thepeople they do not considerf riends of the regim e.  Among these people thatwere sent 

to Siberia were m y wif e's parents. They didnot want to accept Soviet citizenship.  Didnot want to 

take their passports so they were sent to Siberia. W ell,this was sort of fortunatebecause those 

people that were sent to Russia,m ost of them survi ved.  Those thatstayed behind, I would
 
--
 
I 
would say that about 85% ofthose deportedsurvi ved whereas those 90% ofthose that stayed 

b
ehind under German occupation perished.
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, didn't some of your fam ily m em bers join the Com munistParty?
 

Marcel Drim er:  Yes. Yes.  As am atterof fact two of m y f ather's sisters were m em bersof the 

Comm unist Party before the war.  They were i m prisonedand they
 
--
 
you know, they were known to 
the police.  And m y f ather would
 
--
 
you know, when they would go on dem onstration,his sisters 
would go in them iddle of the street andm yf ather would go on the side of the street. Andwhen the 

pol
ice would com e, hecould hearhorses coming, he would run tothe m iddleof  the streetand point 
them  out. But they still  went to prison. Butbecauseof  that, when the Germans attacked Poland in 

June of  1941, June 22, 1941, the
 
--
 
theaunts, who husbands were takento theSoviet Army, they 
took the
 
--
 
their inf ant children and ran with their receive yet Arm y.  T hey also survived.  All of  m y 
unclesof  theage of  serving in m ilitary were taken to the Russian
 
--
 
to the Russian Arm y.  Two of  
them  were killedf ighting the Nazis andthe others cam eback. 
 
Bill Benson: W ere you able to start school during that tim eunder the Soviets?
 
Marcel Drim er: W ell, Iwas ready f or kindergarten but there was noPolish kindergarten, so I went 

to
 
--
 
I went to a Ukrainian kindergartenand was treated just likeeverybody else.  The Jews were not 
selectedf or special treatment.  Special I mean bad treatm ent underthe Russians.
 
Bill Benson: Of  course all of  that would change when Germ any turned on the Soviet Union in June 

of  19 4 1
.  Very quickl y Germ an troopsoccupied Drohobycz and lifefor your fam ily, for Jews 

throughout allof  theoccupied area but certainly in Drohobyc z changed dramatically.  T ellus about 

the Germans com ing in and what happened.
 
Marcel Drim er: T he Germans con
tacted the national
 
--
 
the nationalist Ukrainiansand said
 
--
 
and 
they gave the Ukrainians three chance todowhatever they wantedto do with the Jews.  So the 

Germ ans cam e to Drohobycz on July 1, 1941, and thef irst day
 
--
 
they cam edays before but on Jul
y 
1, 1941, there was a pogrom .  In other words, the people
 
--
 
the Ukrainians could kill
 
--
 
rob, kill, beat 
up the Jews and whathappened in Drohobycz, they would com e tom y grandfather's, maternal 

grandfather's house, and beat him up so thathe died tendays later. There was no accessto 

hospitals or to doctors, so m y grandfatherdied ten days later.  About 200 people, 200 Jews were 

killed in that aktion.  At the same tim em y father was invol ved with m y m other's sister.  Hewas sent 

there for som e universi
ty courses and the Germ ans
 
--
 
local Ukrainians did the same thing as they 
did in Drohobycz.  T hey killed about5,000 Jews, just m urdered on the streets. But when they cam e 

to the place wherem y father lived with his
 
--
 
with m y m other's sister, and covered
 
him  with covers in

thebed and she said Idon't wanted you to go because she was already
 
--
 
it was considered over at 
thattim e.  So she was
 
--
 
she says, I'll go andthe Germans said this is going to be to work and then 
we'll let you go.  And lef t myf ather inthe apartm ent.W henthe Germ ans came she said she was 
only li ving there.  She went to
 
--
 
with them and of  course she never cam e back.  She wasm urdered 
too,onthef irst day of the Germ an occupation m y grandf ather andhis doctor Ryf ka was killed.  M
y 
father had to walk to Drohobycz, about 60 m iles. W hen we came
 
--
 
when m y father cam ehome, 
there was no telephone. W henm y f ather cam ehom e, he
 
--
 
m y m other was ver y happy to seehim . 
W e didn't
 
--
 
you know, we didn't have any phones. W edidn't know what was going on. Butshe was 
ver y upset about her sister.  And we hoped, they hoped,that she wil l com e back, that she'll be 

workin g.  She was only 24 years old.  But shenever cam e back. 
 
So this was thef irstday of the Germanoccupation. T he Germ ans,
 
when they came, they
 
--
 
they 
established rules of existence. T he Jews
 
--
 
the Jews were supposed to wear anarmband with the 
Star of David.  They were not allowed to work
 
--
 
to walk on the side of  the street. T hey were
 
--
 
the 
Germ ans would conf iscate whatever they wa nted to conf iscate.  Fur coats,f or exam ple, because 

they needed itf ortheireasternf ront. T he Jewish kids were notallowed to go to school. T he 

Ukrainian and Polish kids were allowed to go to thef ourth grade because their plan
 
--
 
the Ger
m an ' s  
plan was to kill the Jews and Jewish kids andthere was no needfor their education if  they were 

supposedtobe killed. But thePolesand theUkrainians were supposed to be slave laborand 

they
 
--
 
the Germ ans decided thatfourth grade education was enough for a slave laborer. So I 
couldn't
 
--
 
this was 1941 was the year that I was supposed to start my education.  Of course I did 
not.  I m issed three years of  m y education. 
 

T he situation
 
--
 
you know, if  they
 
--
 
if  they wo uld see
 
--
 
everybody had to wear an arm band, you 
know.  And if they would see som ebody that think suspected this isa Jew without anarm band, they 

would
 
--
 
they would
 
--
 
well, only Je wish m en in Poland were circum sized so this was like a, you 
know, sign that you were Jewish.  So if they would see a man walking on the streets that looked like 

a Jew they would askhim  to drop hispants and if he was Jewish he couldbe killed on thespotor 

taken tothe cam p. 
 
So they also hada ration system that they allowed the Jews to like300 calories
 
a dayf ood.  Andof  
course, there was all the black market.  In our apartm ent where m yfather, mother, and sister lived, 

we also had
 
--
 
we alsohadm y grandmother whosehusband was killed by the Ukrainians,my 
grandfather who was a widower, you could see his picture here, Isaac Drimer and oneof my f ather's 

sister's, Ryf ka, with her two little children. So it was ver y cro wded and it was
 
--
 
there was no food.  
T he situation was getting quite bad.
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, tell us, if  you would, about when you went to stay for a little while with your 

nanny. 
 
Marcel Drim er:  I was just going to.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.
 
Ma rc e l  D rim e r:   S o I
 
--
 
bef ore the war I had ananny.  Her nam e was Jancia, and she lovedm e very, 
ver y m uch andI lovedher.  And she came
 
--
 
this was bef orethe ghetto, this was August of1942.  
T he ghetto was established in Octoberof  '42.  So she came to our place and broughtusf ood quite 

regularl y, about once a week, and m ilk and, you know, played with m ea little. And she once cam e 

and told m e
 
--
 
I was sick with som ething, I don't remem ber what, som e childhood sickness, and she 
told m y m om  that she would like to take m e to her hom e and f eed m e better f ood and give me a 

bath and keepm ef ora week or so.W hile Iwas with Jancia,m y sister
 
started bothering m y m other 
that she wantsto
 
--
 
she wants tohave me back at home to play with m e.  And so m y mother gave in 
and shetook off the arm bandf rom herarm and went to Jancia's house. And when she cam eto

Jancia's house, Jancia was l ying on b
ed and in
 
--
 
gi ving birth to a child, getting ready, but Iwas the 
only other personthere, was sitting in the corner and crying.  I was eight years old, what could I do?  
Som y m other saved actually Jancia's lif eand helped her to deliver the baby, which was born 

stillborn.  And it took quite a while.  It gotdark and so sheaskedusto stay there overnight.
 
In them orning her husband cam e who was on the
 
--
 
he was on thenight shif t. He cam e hom e and 
was ver y surprised that he
 
--
 
to see ustherebecause we didn't have the phone, we didn'ttell Jancia 
that we were com ing. Andhe says that what's going on, he says don't you know what's going on in 

the town?  She lived in the suburbs. And we don't
 
--
 
we didn't know anything.  He said there is an 
aktion going. The Germ ans have to say afew words aboutaktion. It was killing of  Jews on the 

east
 
--
 
easternpartof  the world was called pogrom  when the Russians killed the Jews, Ukrainians 
killed the Jews.  The Germ ans had aktion, they called it aktion. T hey ha
d t wo  d if f e r en t  k i nds  of  

aktion, one was a killing aktion andtaking people
 
--
 
or taking people to the 
concentration
 
--
 
exterm ination camps and another was raup aktion. T hey would com e tothe Jewish 
houses and takeeverything they wanted. Hesaid there was a killing aktion going on intown and if  

they would come hereand see youhere, they would kill you and us. This was oneof  the rules of  

theengagement, the Germ ans said if anon
-
Jewish f am ily gi ves help to the Jews, they woul d be 
k ille d .   J e wis h  f am il
y 
--
 
if  a non
-
Jewishf am ily gi ves a Jew a slice of bread, they would be killed. 
 
Now, again, if theGerm ans that would com e there, I was the only Jew that was circum sized, they 

would recognize.  T hiswas a gi veawa y.  So he says you have to leave the house and go and hide in 

theforest. T here was a wheatf ields inf rontof  their houseand there was som e woods behind the 

road. So we
 
--
 
early in them orning, you know, that day, we would
 
--
 
he gave m y m other som e 
breadand water and we walked over the street and went to the
 
--
 
to the wheatf ield and my m other 
noticed that there'sa indentation inthe ground and we all laid down.  She had a raincoat that was 

the color of  wheat.  Covered us up there andsit and we're laying there very, ver y quiet.  Mother told 

u
s not to scream ,notto cry.  T hen we started hearing shots, screams, Germans crying rous!  Rous!  
Out! Out!  Get out! And hurry up! And then you could hear shotsand people screaming of pain 

andpeoplepraying.  Itwas a, you know
 
--
 
it quieted downf o
r a while, f or 15, 20 m inutes, and then it 
startedall over again.  It lasted like threeorf our hours. 
 
Bill Benson: I think, Marcel, that you toldm ethat your sisterhad described it as a concertof  death.
 
Marcel Drim er:  A concert of death.W e
 
--
 
af t
er the war we
 
--
 
we called it concertof death. AndI 
told the story, called it concertof  death andthen changed it toanother term.
 
But then it stoppedfor a while, stoppedand we waitedf oranotherhour orf or two and gotup and 

started walking towards
 
Jancia'shouse. Aswe cam e to the road,the
 
--
 
there was a Germ an soldier 
with a big dog on the road.  He looked atus,we looked at him .  My m other had my sister on herarm  

and shehad me by m y hand.  And m y sisterwas blond andblueeyed and so was m y m other.  I am  

also blue eyedbutI am  not blond.  I was dark hair.  Andthen
 
--
 
then he looked at usandwe looked 
at him  and it lastedf orever but he justturnedaround and walked away. 
 

My m other andm y sister looked like Christians.  Because Jewish features are totally gi vea way and 

dark hairand soforth. So we wondered why he did this.  So either the
 
--
 
he could have thought 
m aybe thatthis was afarm er wom an with herchildren on the walk or m aybehe was, you know
 
--
 
he 
hadhis quota of  kills. Andanotherthing, hewas by him self . T he Germ an strategy was that when 

they went outtohunt Jews, they would alwa ys go in pairs so that they would not get the chance to 

let the Jewish person go.  He wouldhave ahum anf eeling and let them  go.  But evidently
 
--
 
but this 
guy was alone andhe let us go.  He just turned around.
 
Bill Benson:  You described thatas am iraclereally.
 
Marcel Drim er: W ell, right.  I changed it to coincidence.

Marcel Drim er:  And then we came to Jancia's house and stayed there overnight. T he next m orning 

m y f ather camef rom
 
--
 
to pickus up.  Myf ather was at that tim e in a labor cam pf actory wh ere he 
works.  A lot of  Jewish m en, lady, they have lost theirf am ilies and they have stayed in the dorm itory 

where they could sleep and eat and they also
 
--
 
while they were work ing, they had another badge 
with an A that they arearbeiters. Sothey wer e not killed im mediately.  T hey could live as long as 

the Germansneeded them. They didn'tneed the childrenor the parentsor the wif e if  they were not 

wo r k i n g. 
 
So he cam e topick usup,and then we went to ourapartm ent. As we cam e there, the door was 

broken in,feathers wereflying all over the place,f urniture was turned over, and the apartment was 

em pty.  My aunt with the two children, m y grandm other andm y grandf ather Isaac, they were taken 

to an um shatz platz.  That's a place they keptpeople two or three days withoutf ood, without water, 

without sanitaryf acilities, and then they tookthem  on the cattle trains to t
h e  k illin g
 
--
 
k illin g p la c e .   
Now, the concentration camps utilized peopleto work, like Auschwitz and other cam ps. T here is a 

gentlemanhere who is a survivor of  these concentration camps. But the exterm ination cam ps were 

theones that very, very few people stayed there any longer than24 hours.T hey were kill ed on the 

spot. So m yf am ily went to such a camp.  Itwas Belzec in the eastern part of Poland.

--
 
I know there's so much m ore you want toshare with us, so let'stalk no
w 
about when you were
 
--
 
you and yourfam ily and all theother Jews in Drohobycz were f orced into 
the Drohobycz ghetto.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Yes, this was
 
--
 
we already know here, in October of 1942, the ghetto was 
established.  T hey want to
 
--
 
t he re  is  a P o lis
h saying that
 
( 
speaking non
-
English language
 
).
 
T here is never so bad that it couldn't be any worse.  So this was really the situation.W e were put in 

a one
-
r o om
 
--
 
one room  with several fam ilies in other room s.T he beds were taken out.The 
Germ ans tookouteverything.  So we all
 
--
 
the four of us sleptonthe
 
--
 
one m attress.  T he food 
situation was badandgetting worse.  Butm y father, how we m anaged to live is thatm y father 

bartered thingsforf ood.  He would,f or example, takehis ring.  There were farmers coming to town 

to sell their goods, their fares, andm y father,since he worked outside of the ghetto, he would 

m anage to
 
--
 
to exchange his ring f rom his wedding ringf or a loaf of bread.  His theory was that we 
are not going to worry about things. W e aregoing to worr y about people. W ehave to live.  So this 

is how som etim es Father m anagedto get som efood andm aybe som etim es some neighbors that he 

knew would help us.
 
But the situation intheghetto was getting very, ver y, ver y physical.  And so Father decided that he 

wants
 
--
 
he will take us outof  the ghetto andhideus at the lum berfactory where he worked.  He 
prepared the placefor us on the
 
--
 
in the shed where the wood was drying naturally f orf loors and so 
forth. And also, loosened som e part of thef ence so we could get through thef ence. He bribed the 

guard that was taking the Jews out of the ghetto andbringing them back.  It was
 
--
 
it  wa s  ju s t
 
--
 
he 
would take a big column of Jewish m en and thenput them  intodiff erentfactories where they were 

workin g and then pick them up.
 
And som y m other puton the m en's clothing andtook m y sister under her arm  andm y father took 

m eunder his arm ,and we m arched out of the ghetto. T hen he putus outon
 
--
 
of course, there was 
a street near the
 
--
 
near thefactory, heput us outbehind some bushes and toldm e, you'll stay here.  
You're am an.  And I'll take Mom and Irena to the insideof  thisf actory and then com etopick you 

up.
 
As soon asm yf atherwalked awa y with m y m other and sister I gotver y panicky and I started

scream ing, Daddy, Daddy, don't leave me here.  Because Iheard that people
 
--
 
a bunch of their 
children had went
 
--
 
trying to get alive.  Of  course the guard cam e tom y f atherand he knew him and 
he said that you
 
--
 
youknow, you c
an't do it.  Again, m y f ather took a jacket f rom  his back and gave 
it to the guy.  And we walked in.  And Fatherputus on the
 
--
 
o n t ha t
 
--
 
on the shelf  where the drying 
wood was.  Put us in the attic there. There was no steps or anything, so we would have astring and 
Father would bring usfood, som etim estookthe waste away.  So we would putthe string down and 

get thefood andthis is how we li ved f orabout two or three weeks.
 
Bill Benson: This is incredible, though, thathe builta hiding placefor you inside the lum ber factory 

where he was doingf orced labor.
 
Ma rc e l  D rim e r:   Ye s .
 
Bill Benson: Astonishing.
 
Marcel Drim er: T heywouldn't let him  work the regular off ice. They built a little shedfor him . They 

needed him but
 
--
 
so this was going on for
 
aweek or two weeks.  And afriend of m yf ather's cam e 
to him  and says, Jacob, there is a woman here, her nam e is Theresca, who suspects that you 

a re
 
--
 
that you have som ebody in hiding here.  And she says that she'll do
 
--
 
she wants tom ake sure 
sh e 's ri
ght and she'll do the right thing, which m eantto go to the Germ ansand renounce us, that 
was the right thing. Father was terribly upsetandhad to com eup with some way of saving us.  He 

hadaf riend,a goodf riend who was a doctor.  He was thedoctor in the local clinic.  Of course he 

was Jewish but he was educated inVienna like, you know, this was
 
--
 
when m y parents wer e young, 
Drohobycz was under
 
--
 
there were collegespeople could study here now.  So they got togetherand 
the doctor offered m y father 
that he will write a letter totheSS saying that he is an SS man on leave 
f rom  thef rontand that this specif ic girl inf ected him with syphilis.  And he did.  And he did write that 

letter. And the next day two SS men came and tookT herescaaway.  And of course they took her to 

the clinic where thedoctor was and thedoctor conf irm ed
 
--
 
I don't know how it works but he 
conf irmed that she was infectedand she was sick and she was putaway to be seen only af ter the 

wa r .
 
My f ather
 
--
 
after the war m y father t
old her that
 
--
 
how it happened that she wentaway.
 
Bill Benson: And so,Marcel, of  course thiswas a situation that's such that you can't stay there very 

long so yourf ather at the sam e time is thinking about where he cantake hisfather to protect them .
  
So tellus what happens f rom there.
 
Marcel Drim er: W ell, you know, we were af raid that
 
--
 
this was getting absolutely im possible 
because we couldn't be theref orever, plus, we all thoughtthat the war is coming to an endandthat 

the Germans would kill everybody.  T hey would keep the Jews only as long asthey needed them  

andthey would kill them . So Father said wehave to goandf indanotherplace.
 
He took his arm bandoff his arm  and wenttovil lages, to the villages  nearby tof inda placefor us to 

hide.  Som e people treated him nice and some people not so nice.  One place they asked him  for 

his watch or else.  And/or else isalways we'l l gi ve you to the Germ ans and you'll be dead. Thenhe 

ran into the Sawinski fam ily who were neighbors of  himother's and they knew m y m other since she 

was a little girl.  T hey offeredtotakem y m other and m y sister to hide. 
 
W eagain, because Jewish m en were branded, you know, and so my
 
--
 
his philosophy was  that we 
hadto save anybody that we can.  So Father agreed, to takem y m other and my sister.  So 

Mrs .
 
Sawinski cam e to thedorm itory where m y f ather worked and he tookus down f rom the shed 
where we were and she cam eand we were s aying good
-
bye to m y m other andm y sister. Of 
course, it was a very, very traum atic situation.  Everybody was cr yin g and Mrs.
 
Sawinski, who had 
four children of herown, grown children, shesays well, whatever wi l l be will be, just take the boy 

too. So shetook usand we went tof orests and rivers and we hidat thefarm.

T hef arm  was a very, very poorf arm. T hey
 
--
 
they had ahouse with a thatched roof , thef loor was 
unf inished.T hef ood situation was also very critical because thefarm ers also had
 
--
 
they couldn't 
get m uchm ore than anybody else and they were not allowed to slaughter any anim alsbecause 
Germ ans kepta very good record of that.  And they had to give f irstthing to theGermanArm y to 

eat. So they had a very, very hard s
ituation.
 
We
 
--
 
we were hiding
 
--
 
they dug upa holeunder the house and so som e of
 
--
 
you know, so we 
would hide. I have to jum pf orwards a littlebit.  And then there was about 13 of us
 
Bill Benson:  Don't jump quite thatfar yet.  So f irst, it's your motherand your sister and youin hiding 

in their littletiny farm  house with dirtf loors.  And youm ake aholeunder the ground.  Andat some 

point, as youm entioned,f oodfor them , eventhoughthey had afarm , was very tough to get. And of  

course you had
 
no m edical care.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Absolutely.
 
Bill Benson:  No medical care. And at som epoint your sisterbecam e ill and I want tobesure you 

tell us about that.
 
Marcel Drim er:  My sister, when we were hiding on the attic she would lookout of the attic
 
and say 
look at the chickens running aroundf reeandshe would say why ca n't Ibea chicken? I could run 

around and livef ree. But she also hada
 
--
 
she was bleedingf romher nose and she wasver y, very 
weak, underfed, you know.  And we were thinking about how couldwe bury her without having 

gi ving us awa y.  It was
 
--
 
it was quite bad.
 
But another
 
--
 
the way that we
 
--
 
we did get som ef ood,the
 
--
 
therewas a ref inery, oil ref inery about 
a m ileand ahalf away f rom  thefarm where my uncle Abraham  Gruber
 
worked, he was abutcher.
 
Bill Benson: Again, so people know, he worked buthe wasf orced labor.
 
Marcel Drim er:  He was forced labor, of  course. T his was a labor cam p.  So the youngestboy would 

take cars with the big container and take it tothe
 
--
 
to  
wherem y uncle was working and they would 
get scrapsf rom  the cafeteria where the laborers were eating andm y uncle would give them 

som etimes a loaf of  bread or som em eat,forwhich if  the Germ ans see it they would have killed him  

for it.  So when they brought back the scrapsf rom  thetables, thepeople, we had thef irst
 
--
 
the f irst 
choice and then the pigs got the other part. 
 

It wa s
 
--
 
you know, we would bathe onceamonth.  In the wintertim e, which was m ost of the time of 
our hiding, we would hide inthe atticof  thehouse and we were being sm oked because there was 

no
 
--
 
no chimney. T he situation was ver y, ver y critical
 
Bill Benson: And Marcel, as you were starting to tell us, over the
 
--
 
you were there in theSawinskis' 
homefor almosta year.  And as
 
you said,eventually there ended upbeing 13people in hiding.
 
Ma rc e l Drim e r:   Righ t .
 
Bill Benson: Tell us how that was even possible. 
 
Marcel Drim er:  Okay. W ell, there was
 
--
 
this uncle of  m ine that helped to f eed us, I
 
--
 
wh ile  s t ill in  
the ghetto he
 
f ixedupsom e crystals f rom a chandelier because Germ ans were robbing things and 
the chandelierfell down.  Hepicked up som ecrystals and asked a jewel
 
--
 
Bill Benson: A jeweler?
 

Marcel Drim er:  A jeweler tom ake him a ring. Andhemade him a ring and the ring looked
 
--
 
the 
crystal looks like diamond.  And whenm y
 
--
 
when m y uncledecided to get out of the labor cam p, he 
cam e tothe Sawinskis and said
 
--
 
asked them to take this andhe lives with a wom an at thistim e 
who was a widower.  H e was
 
--
 
who was
 
a wi dow and he was already a wido wer becausehis wif e 
and child were killed.  So he cam e tothe Sawinskis and showed them the ring and said I'll gi ve you 

this diam ond ring if  you'll hideus, takeus and hide usuntil theendof  the war.  Sawinskis said
 
--
 
lo s t  
their last cow and they were
 
--
 
and they were desperate, so Mr.
 
Sawi nski saidhere, we'll take you

but I'll have to sell the ring to buy the cow.  Uncle had to beg them  not to sell the ring because it's 
f a m ily
 
--
 
B ill B e n s on :   Fa m ily h eirlo o m .
 
Ma rc e l
 
Drim er:  Heirloom and he prom ised he would buy him a cow right after the war.  So they let 
him  be there, they let him  com e with the ladyfriend and the little girl.  So there was anotherthree 

people. And then
 
--
 
this was quite close to the end. If  it was another two, threem onths, we wouldn't 
survi ve.  T hen some of the Sawinski fam ily had som e Jews in hiding andthey didn't want to keep 

them  anym ore. Sothe Sawinskis took them  so there were 13of  us hiding.
 
Bill Benson: So someof  you arehiding ina little bitof  space between the ceiling and the 

thatched
 
--
 
topof  thethatched roof where the sm oke com es through.
 
Ma rc e l Drim e r:   Righ t .
 
Bill Benson: Som eare in a hole in the ground.  Som e are in a woodshed?
 
Ma rc e l  D rim e r:   N o , t he
 
--
 
i n  t he  s umme rt i me
 
we hid in the barn where the cows were also.  And 
then what happened is it was a ver y poorf arm . W e were hiding in the barn and thef loor
 
--
 
we were 
on the
 
--
 
thef loor of the attic fell down and wef ell to the cows with the cows and the pigs. So then 
w
e would all hide
 
--
 
we  switched.  Some people were hiding in the
 
--
 
in the atticand som e were in 
the hole.
 
Bill Benson: And of  course now the Russians are advancing and they're getting close and then 

bombardm entsbegin and you toldm e that the bom bardmentactually gave you a chance togo 

outside, right? Say som ething aboutthat.
 
Marcel Drim er: W ell, the allies were quite close tothef rontf rom  the west and they would com e and 

bomb thefactory where m y uncle
 
--
 
ref inery, oil ref inery, which was ver y close.  And this was the 
only tim e that we could
 
--
 
that Jews, we could get out and stretch our legs andbreathe some clean 
air becauseeverybody was hiding. W e weretheonly onesthere.  And we
 
--
 
so, you know, this 
wa s
 
--
 
plus we knew th at the end is close.W e alsoheard the artillery com ing f rom theeast and 
bombs com ingf rom  the west.  So we knew that this was going to betheend ofthe war.  And it was 

August 6, 1944.  Idon't remember thedate but I readabout itobviously.  And we
 
--
 
the farm ers 
looke
d out and they said there's Russian soldiers m arching on the road.  And we would get outand 

startedhugging them and kissing them , which didn'tmake them  very happy because we were dirty 

and stinky. 
 

(Laughter)
 
Bu t
 
--
 
but this was
 
--
 
this was the end.
 
Bill Benson: Sofor you the war ends in August 1944.
 
Ma rc e l Drim e r:   Righ t .
 
Bill Benson: And of  course it would continueelsewhere until theend of  the war in spring of 1945.
 
Marcel Drim er:  May 5, 1945.
 
Bill Benson:  Com ing up 70thanniversary. W hathappenedfor younow that you're, quote, 

liberated?  Now the Soviets are here, they'reon them arch.  So what happened?
 
Marcel Drim er: W ell,first of  all,I could not
 
--
 
m y m uscles, leg m uscles were atrophiedbecauseI 
was m ost of that last year I was lying
 
down or  sitting.  I didn'tplay.  So I couldn't walk.  I had to learn 
how to walk again. W e were whispering. W e didnot
 
--
 
we are notallowed to talk loud. W eare 
whispering.  M y f ather entertained us whispering songs, PolishandJewish songs to us, whispering.  

So Ihad to learnagain how to talknorm ally.  Andm y teacherf irst tim e schoolteacher com plain to 

m y m other that theboy doesn't play with other kids and he just doesn't talk anym ore andthere's a 

problem . And m y mother saidhe'll overcome that. I did overcomeit. 
 

But the situation

occupation.  It was a hell still but notas hell as theGermans.  My f ather was director of
 
--
 
he was 
m ade director of thatfactory that we had to

Bill Benson:  He had beenaforced laborer in, slave laborer.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Rightand the generals
 
--
 
the Russian generals would come andask him  to provide 
lum berf or thef rontbecausethef ront was nearby.  Andm y father was sitting behi
nd a big desk but 
he was barefoot.  So the general says that'sa sham e that thedirector of thefactory is barefoot.  He 
said Idon't have any shoes.  You know, ever ything was gone.  Andso the Russian Arm y gave him  

som e shoes andtheygave m e apair of bo
o ts .   A n d
 
--
 
but the Russian system  at that time, and I 
think that it's com ing back to what it was at that time,they considered you guilty until proven 

innocent. This was their m otto. So oneday he was called to the KGB andmy father was called to 

the KGBand they said it's something
 
--
 
som ething is ver y strange here.  Youand yourf amily 
survi ved and90%of  the other Jews were dead.  Youm ust have collaborated with the Germ ans.  So 

can you imagine, you know, hefought likea lion to get
 
--
 
and then he had to apologize f orbeing 
alive. W ell, hem anaged to get som e other Jews that were survi vor s and some Gentiles that knew 

him  based on bef orethe war and during the war and he had to convi nce them  that they wer e
 
--
 
that 
he was not a collaborator. 
 
B ill B e n
son:  Marcel, the Sawinski fam ily, thefam ily you stayed with, they m ust have been incredibly 
brave.  They put their lives on the line.  Say som ething about the Sawinskis and what you 

f o lk s
 
--
 
you and your fam ily did for the Sawinskis.
 
Ma rc e l Drim e r:   Righ
t.W ell,m y sister who lives in Israel now nom inated them  Righteousof the

af ter the war 
my

of

(Laughter)
 
T hey never knew because m y uncle bought it backf rom them , got itbackf rom them ,andf or thef irst 

m oney thathe could spare he boughtthem a cow.  So they were
 
--
 
t hey were ver y happy and we 
were very happy thatwe are alive, of course. 
 

In Decem ber of 1945we left Drohobycz, Dro hobycz became at that tim ethe Republic of Ukraine, 

the Republicof  theSoviet Union andm ostof the Polesand Jews we re allowed to leave that and go 

t
o the territories that Poland inheritedf rom Germ any.  Poland shifted westward.  East becam e part 
of  the Soviet Unionand the territories likeLower Silesia, Lower Silesia became Polish.  So we went 

thereand we lived in a town called Baldrich (phonetic) andnearby by a universit y town.  And I lived 

there until 1961, got my

I got m y degree inm echanicalengineering in '57.  I cam eto theUnited

And I saidtom y father that I would like to study philosophy or literature, humanities, and Father said 
I have abetter idea.  You better study som ething that you canm akea living anywhere in the world.  

How aboutm edicine or engineering?

W ell,m edicine was not m y schtick so I studied engineering.  By thewa y, my

bef ore doing so, I want to thank all of youf orbeing here.  Rem ind you that we'll have a

W ednesday andThursday intothem iddle of August, so we hope that you can return 
and have another
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program  withus at some point.  Bef ore I turn back to Marcel, I would 
like to say a couple ofthings.  One, when Marcelf inishes, I'm  going to a
sk 
--
 
our photographer Joel 
is going to come up on the stage and we're going to ask you to stand because he'd like to take a 
photographof  Marcelwith you as thebackdrop. So we'll ask to you do that. T hen when Marcel is 

done, because we didn't have a chancefor question and answer period with you, if  youhave a 

question you want to ask himor if  you just want to shake hishand or takea photograph with him, 

Marcel wi ll rem ain here on the stage.  And so justabsolutely feelf ree to com euponthe stage, u
se  

the steps, please, come up here and just visit  with him .  So please, absolutely, we'd like yo u todo 

that if youf eel inclinedto do so.
 
So it's our tradition at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
that our
 
F irs t  P e rs on
 
hasthe lastword.  So with that, I'dlike 
Marcel to have the last word
 
Marcel Drim er:  I'm  talking to you and otherswho want to listen tome because there are people and 

organizations who claim  thatthe Holocaust is a hoax, that it never happened, thatthe Jews m ade it 

up to getm oney f rom  the Germ ans. I am  a witness thatthis did happen.  By listening tothe stories 

of m y childhood you become witnessesalso.  Our goodf riends the late Charlene Schiff said that we 

have tof ightthef our evil I.'s, intolerance, injustice, ignorance, and indiff erence. T hose are the roots 

of m en'sm oral corruption thatallowed Hitler and hishelpers to come to power and tortureand 

m urder m illionsof  people he considered under, not worth livin g.  Not only Jews but peoplewith 

disabilities, gypsies, hom osexuals,and many other groups.  Changing thesebehaviors is a path to 

preventing Holocaust and genocideand this is what this Holocaust isall about. And Ialso would 

like to read what Pastor Niem oller said whenhe was saved
 
--
 
liberated in Dachau about 
indiff erence. First they camef orthe socialists and I did not speakout because I was not a socialist.  

T hen they cam efor the trade unionists, and I did not speak out becauseI was nota tradeunionist.  

T hen they cam efor the Jews andI did not speak outbecause I was nota Jew.  Then they camef or 

m eand there was noone left to speakfor me.
 
I would also like tom entionthat them useumopeneda new exhibit titled " Cambodia: 1975
-
1979"  
and it'saboutthe killing f ieldsof  Cam bodia.  It's a very good exhibit.  Andthank you.
