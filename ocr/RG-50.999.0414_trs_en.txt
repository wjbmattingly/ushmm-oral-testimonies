Poland.  
 
 
On June 22, 1941, Germ any violated the Germ an
-
Soviet pact and attacked Soviet territory.   
W ithinafew weeks, Drohobych was occupied by Germ anf orces.  In1942 mem bersof  Marcel's 
fam ily, including his grandfather, whom  we see here, were deported to concentration camps where 
they were m urdered.  
 
 
In  the fa ll of  
1942, Marcel and hisfam ily were  forced intothe Drohobych ghetto.  Here we see 
an historical photograph of  Jews beingf orced into the Drohobych ghetto.  
 
 
Bef ore the liquidation ofthe ghetto, thefam ily escaped to a small vill age.  In August1943, 
Ma rc e l
 
went into hiding with a Polish Ukrainianf am ily.  Marcel's fam ily is seen in thisphototaken in 
1947 or 1948.  From  left to right, we see Marcel's uncle, Abraham  Drim er, his parents,Laura and 

Jacob, and Marcel's uncle, Abraham Gruber.  
 
 
In 1957, Marcel
 
earned adegree inm echanical engineering.  He imm igrated to the United 
States in 1961 where his wife, Ania, joinedhim  in1963. Soon afterarrival in the United States,he 

was hired by the USPost Office Departmentto work on the designof m ail sorters and conve yors.  
Af ter a very successf ul period with the Post Off ice Department, Marcel transferred to the US Arm y as 
a civilian in 1972.  He then workedas am echanical engineerf ortheArm y Corps of  Engineers.  
T hough he retiredf rom the arm y in 1994, he rem ained a consultantwith the arm y until 2010.  As he 
notes, he is now truly r etired.  
 
 
Ania trainedas a pharm acist in Polandand continuedherprof ession af ter herarrival in the US, 
and isnow also retired.  Marcel and Aniahave a son,Adam , who lives

Althoughoff icially Marcel and Ania are retired, they both do considerable work as volunteers 
with the museum .  Marcel translates docum ents written in Polish, and Ania edits Marcel'stranslations.  
 
[Laughter]
 
He translatedportions of Emanuel Ringleblum 's " Notesf rom theW arsaw Ghetto," a 25,000

collectionof  diaries and other docum ents detailing the events
 
and lives of those who lived in the 
doom edW arsaw ghetto.  Marceland Ania also worked onthe museum exhibit titled" SomeW ere 
Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust,"  which wil l open at the end of this m onth.  
T o help with this new exhibit, they revie wed and transcribed som eof the several hundred film ed

Marcel, thank you som uchfor joining us, and your wil lingness to be our 
F i rs t  Pers o n
 
t o day.   
W ehave justan hour,we have so m uchfor you to share with us. W e'll just begin, start right away.  
 
 
W orldW ar II began inSeptember 1939 when Germany attackedPolandf rom the west, and 
that wasf ollowed quickly by the Soviet Union attacking Polandf rom the east.  Early in thewar, you 

and yourfam ily lived under Soviet occupation.  Before we talkaboutthattime, why don't we startf irst 
with you. T ell usabout your f am ily, your comm unity and what lif e was like bef orethe war
 
began.  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  My fam ily was m iddle class.  Father was anaccountant, as Bill said before.  

Mother was a housekeeper. I hada sister,Irena, who is still alive, thanksGod, in Israel.  
 
 
My grandfather, whom you saw here, was a  
--
 
he worked
 
in the ref inery, oil refinery nearby 
Drohobych, andm y other grandf ather was abutcher, a kosher butcher.  
 
 
Drohobych was a quaint little town of  40,000people, 39,000, 40,000.  Equally divided among 
Polish habitants, Ukraniansand Jews.  There was about
 
12,000 Jews in Drohobych.  
 
 
T here were culturalfacilities for the Jews.  The Jews hadtheir own sports clubs.  Oneof my 
uncles was a very active and good player in the soccer team, the local soccer team .  Uncle Usef . 
T here was a beautif ulorphanage known all over the country of Poland.

People basically li ved in peaceamong them selves.  T here were som etim es some 
m isunderstandings and people would get intof ights, butall in all itwas a peaceful place. 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, did you have a largeextendedf am ily?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Yes, I had
 
--
 
m y f ather was one of f ive siblings, andm y m other was theoldest.  
Father was the oldestof f ive; m y mother was also theoldest of foursiblings.  I'll talk abo
ut them  a 
lit t le ,  a  lit t le la t e r.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK. That sounds good.  
 
 
On September 17, 1939, RussiaattackedPoland.  Asa result, you lived under Russian 
occupationuntil June of1941.T ell us what life was like under the Russians,before the Ge
rm ans 
c a m e.   
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  I would liketom ention that today, April 10, is the 73rd anniversary of  them urder.  

W hen the Russians attackedPolandon Septem ber 17, 1939, they took about 22,000POW s, senior 
and
 
--
 
officers and senior NCOs to the camps, and on 10th of April in 1940 they killed them all.  
 
 
T hree years ago,a group of Polish, Polish presidentand Polish m ilitary high off icers and the 
governm ent got intoaplane to goto open am useum  or af lag there, and that planefell down and 
crashed.
  
T his was another tremendous, trem endous tragedyf or the Polish nation on that date. That 
terrible anniversary.  
 
 
Now about lif eunder the Russians. The Jews were not specif ically pointed up to any special 
bador goodtreatm ent.  They were just
 
--
 
the 
situation was quite hard.  T here were shortages of food 
and shortagesof  clothing, but we were just like everybody else. W ewere just treated like ever ybody 
else.

My m other was a seam stress, and she would sew the clothing thatI was wearing and m y 
sist
er was wearing.  Now, at the sam e tim e,Poland, the westernpart of  Poland was under German 
occupation. W e heard what was going on.  There were peoplethatm anaged to escapef rom  western 
Poland. There were also some Jews that escapedf rom  Germ any.  W eeven had a Jewish ref ugee in 
our housefor af ew we eks.  
 
 
So we knew what was going on.  Of course, there was nopress likewe have the press now, 
but thepeople toldus what was going on, and what was going on was terrible. 
 
 
My f ather's
 
--
 
well, when the
 
Germ ans attacked Poland, Russiaat that time,on June 22, they 
cam e to Drohobych atabout July 1.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, before we go there, letm e ask you a couple more questions about that 

periodunder the Soviets.  You were able to start schoolf or
 
a periodof  time then, Ithink. 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Kindergarten. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som eof yourf am ily m embers joined the Com munist Party, is that correct?  
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:   Ye s .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som evolunteeredf or the Russian Arm y?  
 
>>
 
Marcel Drim er:  They didn't have to volunteer. T hey were draf ted.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK.  I was going to ask you, your birthday, if you don't mind, your birthday is May 1, 
which is a signif icant date in the comm unist world.  
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
  
Tha t's tru e.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about the signif icanceof  your birthdate of May 1.

>> Marcel Drim er: W ell, actually, I was born15m inutes bef ore m idnight, on April 30, but I was born 
in m y grandparents' house, and m yf ather sort of  thought that sinceMay 1 is an international workers' 
day, holiday, sohe registeredm eas May 1.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Don't give it up.  Don't
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: T hat's our secret.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  That's our secret. Anyway, what else?  Now, atthe tim e when the Germ ans 

attacked theSoviet Union, m y m other's two sisters had children, one m onth and two m onths old.  
T heir husbands were taken to theSoviet Union arm y, and they decided whenthe Soviet Arm y was 
withdra wing, going east, they just decidedto join them and just go east and save their lives.  
 
 
Also,m y m other's youngest brother, who was the soccer player, he was 21.  He was 21 years 
old, so he didn't even tell his parents that he's planning to go to Russia.  He just took a sandwich, 
went to work, and just got on thetruck going to Russiaand wenttoRussia.  
 
 
T henalsom y father'syoungest brother was also takenfor the Russian Army.  Some of them  
survi ved.  Som eof  them  didn't survi ve.  Butm y auntsandm y
 
--
 
both uncles, two aunts and two 
uncles
 
that went to Russia, they survi ved.  One of the husbands was killed in a Russianm ilitary, on 
the f ront.  
 
 
So actually, this was
 
--
 
the Soviets also deported a lot of  people that they considered enem ies 
of  the state. T hey deported,for example,Ania's parents. They wer e upper middle class. Her father 

was a doctor,motherwas a lawyer.  And they did not

they didn'twant to accept the Soviet

passport, sothey were sent toSiberia, whereAnia was bornduring the war.  Luckily, herf ather was a 
doctor, 
so he delivered her there in Russia. This is how they survi ved.  
 
 
So them ajority of  those peoplethat ran to Russia or even were deported to Russia were 
saved by deportation.  T hey survi ved, 80% to90%. W hereas, thosethat stayed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Including your f am ily.  
 

>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:  
 
--
 
including m yf am ily, about 90% were killed.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthe Germans came in,things changed alm ost instantly and very tragically.  

T ell us about those changes rightf rom the get
-
go .   
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m
er:  Thef irst day, July 1, theGerm ans allowed theUkranians to have a pogrom, to just 
go to Jewish hom es, to take whatever they wa nted, to beatpeople up, and these were mostly 
peasantsthat lived outside of Drohobych, and they were ver y poor. So they were looking for chances 
to steal or to grab from the Jews.  
 
 
W hat happened,m y maternal grandf ather was beaten up. T hey took things out, whatever they 
could carry out, am ong others they took the photo album sf rom their house.  Of course, they were not 

in
terested inthe photos.  They were interested in thealbum s. Sothey shook out thealbum s
 
--
 
a ll of  
thephotosfell onthe ground inm udand water, anda neighbor,a Ukrainian neighbor cam eover, 

picked them  up,and just kept them .  After the war, f ather went to look what's left of m y grandparents' 
house, of course nothing was lef t there. T his neighbor came out and gave him a stackof pictures, 
and said,"T his is what I picked up when your father
-
in
-
law was beaten up."  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hose are som e of
 
the photographs?  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

>> Marcel Drim er:  Som e of thephotographs that you see here. T he one you saw me and m y 
m other, August 1934,was in that stack. There's about40or 50there onmy side.  
 
 
My grandfather didnot have access toany doctors, to any medicine, so he died intwo weeks.  
At the sam e time,m y father was involved, hewas sent by the work where he worked to som e 
university, to take some university courses, andm y aunt was with him . There was alsoanaktion in 
the war, and
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  An aktion? Anaction by theGerm ans? Describe that?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  This was an action by theGerm ans, taking people, putting them into cam ps. 
T here were also raupaktion, they would do, take whatever they wantedf rom your house, and they 
wouldn't 
touch you.  Raupaktion.  T his was a killing aktion. T hey were telling people thatyoung 
people are being taken to work.  Sothatm y auntputm y father on the bed, covered him wit h
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Blankets?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Blankets. And the Germ ans cam eand took her, and m y father stayedthere.  He 

didn't come backf ora day, for two,f or a week.  She was taken to acam p on Nayanof skaStreet.  
T hey took her and shewas killed there.  
 
 
My f ather walkedbackto Drohobych onfoot,cam e back and joinedus.  If we were all together 
in Drohobych at that tim e, we could have probably also gone to Russia.  But a mother with two young 
children, she just couldn't do it. W ehad no com munications withf ather. There was no telephones, 
there was nothing.

> Bill Benson:  Eventually, he was able to com e home?

>> Marcel Drim er:  Hejust walked.  It was about60 kilom eters, Ithink.  I'm  looking at thepeoplef rom  
Ru s s ia .   
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your nanny andwhat happened with the nanny.  
 
>> M a r c
el Drim er:  OK. W hen the Germ anscam e, they m ade all kinds of laws.  They putup
 
--
 
these 
were not laws, but these were their orders.  People had to give up, bring to a certain place radios, 

telephones,m oney, books.  It was just whatever they wanted. For exam ple, they neededfur coatsfor 
thef ront,f or the soldiers for the winter, so they also conf iscated thefur coatsf rom the people.  
 
 
Food was rationed, and we 
--
 
working people received like 8ounces of  breada day, 
nonworking about 4ounces of breada day.  
 
 
So inorder to live, m y fatherhad tobarter. T hef arm ers would com eto town and they would 
sell their goods, butmy f ather didn't have m oney, so he bartered.  For exam ple, he would take off a 

ring f rom his wedding ring and exchange itf or two
 
loaves of  bread. 
 
 
In our house 
--
 
sorry.  In ourhouse was m y gr andfather, the onethat you show here,and my 
grandm other,m y m other's m other was a widow, and m yf ather's sister with two little children, whose 
husband was also taken to the Russian Arm y.
  
These people just absolutely could not take care of  
them selves. T hey couldn'tf ind any food. T hey couldn'tf ind any shelter.  T hey just had to be with us.  
 
 
T hef ive of  them andf our of  us, it was nine people in a one
-
bedroom or two
-
bedroom  
apartm ent.
  
The situation was absolutely critical.  Ialso got some child's
 
--
 
what was the sickness?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Measles?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Measles or som ething.  Ihada nanny beforethe war.  She would come tous 

ever y once ina while, brings us m ilk or
 
bread.  She lovedm e very much. A very nice lady, Jancia.

Oneday, she came, she said, " You live here like anim als cram ped. I'll take Marcel withme tom y 
house, I'll give him  a bath,I'llf eed him  a little, then I'll bring him back."  
 
 
She was pregnant,by the way.  She was 8,9 m onthspregnant.  Sonobody askedme if  I want 
to go, but, you know, I just went.  Of course, it was nice.  Ihad plenty to eat and everything.  But what 
happened ism y sister m issedme, because we played together, andtold our mother we should get 
Marcel back. There were no telephones; we couldn't com municatewith Jancia.  Som y m other took 
her armband with theStar of David, the Jews had to wear arm bands, but she, my motherhadblue 
eyes and she was blonde,and m y sister was
 
also blonde, blue eyes, so they pretended to be 
Christians, and they went to Jancia. 
 
 
W hen they came to Jancia, I was sitting in the corner, you know, like scared mouse, and 
Jancia was onbed. She was in labor.  She'd just gone into laboratthe very same time.  
 
 
Som y m other told m y sister to sitdown.  She boiled som e water and did whatever needs to be 
done in that situation,and the child was born, was stillborn.  So couldn't save the child.  
 
 
By the time it got quite dark, we stayed in Jancia's house. And the next morning, her husband 
was not hom e, he was workin g night shift somewhere, he came home in them orning andhe was 

ver y surprised to see us there.  He says, " You can'tbehere. T he gentiles hiding Jews wer e killed."  It 
was not
 
--
 
i t  wa s d
angerousfor the gentiles to keep the Jews.  He said, "If  theGermans see you here, 
we  a ll will b e  k ille d . "   
 
 
So he gave us apieceof  bread,and told usthat acrossthe street there was a wheatf ield.  It 
was August. W heat was sort of abeige color, then there was aforest behind that.  He says, " You go 

to theforest andhide there,and maybe you'll be lucky."

Som y m other tookm e and m y sister, and we walked, and thenbefore we entered thef orest 
there was an indentation inthef ield, so we decided, mother decided to lie us there.  Shehada 
raincoatthe color of bright wheat.  So she covered us with that raincoat.  
 
 
W e were therefor half  an hour,hour, when we started hearing a Germ an scream ing " Rous!"  
T hatm eans" Out, out."  You would hear dogsbarking, and you would hear people begging for mercy, 
andthen you hear shots and som epeople scream ing f rom pain.  And it lasted like15m inutes, and 
then it stoppedfor amom ent,orf or15m orem inutes,and then it startedall over again.  Itwas like 
t h is
 
was like a light motif , the sam emusic, quoteunquote, people crying, begging f or mercy, 
Germ ans scream ing, dogs barking.  It lastedabout threeorf ourhours.  
 

 
Somehow we were not found by the Germ ans.  So af ter the sun went down and it gota little 
da
rker, we would get up, and it quited down. T here was nom ore the screaming and shooting and 

dogs barking and so forth.  So we got up, and we started walking towards Jancia's house. 
 
 
As we approached thestreet, we cam eto thestreet,m other was carrying
 
Irena andI was 
holding herhand, we cam e tothe street, looked to the right and there was a Germ an soldier with a 

big dog, Germandog,andhe just lookedatus, and we looked athim . It seemed like hours, but must 
have been 30 seconds.  And thenheturned aroundand walked away.  
 
 
So we were quite
 
--
 
this was, I don't know, luck or som ething.  Maybe we were wondering wh y 
he did it.  Now, one of the reasonsthat he could have done it is because he was by him self .  They 

usually worked, hunted the Jews in pairs.  Sonobody would show their weakness and be hum aneto 
the Jews, because this was the m ilitary had different orders.  But hedidn't have apartner of whom  to 
be af raid, so he justturnedaroundand walked away.

Perhaps it was already

Germ ans with theiraccuracy, m aybe they decided thatthey will d o it 
until 7:00, and then it was over.  But anywa y,f or whatever reasons, he walked,turned aroundand 
walked awa y, we sur vi ved thatday.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were able to get back hom e?  
 
>> M a r c
el Drim er: W ell, we cam e to Jancia,and it was still

it was already night.  The next m orning 
father cam e to pickus up.  Father was at the lum berf actory.  People who worked in addition tothe 

Star of David, they also had another badge with an A,arbeiter. T his was som ething everyb ody 
wanted to have. Those who worked for thewar eff ort were temporarily allo wed to live.  They needed 
those people.  
 
 
Sof ather came inthem orning and tookus,and we went backhom e to our house. W henwe 
cam e there, thedoorswere knockeddown, thef urniture were scattered allover the place. T here was 
featherf rom  thepillows running around, youknow, thehouse, andnobody was there.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So had you not goneto yourform ernanny's house,you would have been taken 

then?

Marcel Drim er:  They were taken tothe place,um shatz platz, I readabout it later,theywere there 
for two days in that umshatz platz.  Inhum ane conditions,notoilets,nofood, no water. T hen they 
were loaded into cattle trains and taken to Belzec, which was an exterm ination camp,andput to 
death imm ediately.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, in the early f all of 1942 is when theGermans created the ghetto in 
Drohobych.  Youand your fam ily were f orcedinto that ghetto. T ell us what life was like in the ghet
to  
andhow your parents,what they did to survive there.

>> Marcel Drim er: W ell, m y f ather, we got one room  inthe ghetto. T hat was anapartment m aybeof  
three,four room s, but there were three orfour fam ilies in the apartment. We hadone room, we ha
d 
onebed, and we all slept inone bed. Thebed was taken away in one of the raup aktion, so it was 
just am attress. So we sleptall in that. 
 
 
T he situation was so bad that it really was absolutely unbearable.  Food was always a 
problem . They had these aktionen every so of ten. They would com eand either try to squeeze that 
towel to wrap anything they could, or they wer e com ing to takepeople away.  
 
 
By the way, the Germans grabbed som uch in these countries that they occupied, that the 
Germ an people didn'thave topay taxes. W e, we the victim s, supported the war eff ortagainst us.  
 
 
So it was
 
--
 
and we also,f atherthought that the ghetto will be liquidated. T here were some
 
--
 
until 1943, we m anaged to live in the ghetto. It was ver y, ver y hard.  The sanitary conditions were 

terrible.  It was terrible.  
 
 
Sof atherdecided that we have to leave the ghetto and try tof ind hiding somewhere else.  
Father worked at the lum berfactory as an accountant, but he also was a lumber technician.  He 

couldn't work with theAryans together.T heJews were not allowed to work in the same off ice where 
the non
-
Jews worked, so they built him a little shack in thef ield, where he kepthis things and slept 
som etimes, instead of  going back tothe ghetto.  
 
 
So f ather pr

fatherdecided to takeus, to takem y m other, sister and I,back to that 
lum berf actory.  He bribed the guy, becausepeople, thePolish guide would com e to the ghetto and 

take the workers totheir places of work, and they would just get thenumbe
rs and so forth, then in the 
evening he would gof rom  placetoplaceto gather these workers totake them hom e.

somebody stayed in the ghetto, they didn'tfeel good. So m y mother dressed like 
a man,and she tookmy sisters under her arm.  My f ather tookm e under his arm. And we just 
walked out of of the ghetto.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Under their coats? 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Under their coats. T his is how we got out of theghetto. Father took us to som e 
bushes next to thefence to the ghetto. 
 
Bef ore he lef t, the day before he lef the loosened som e 
planks in thef ence,and we cam e back tothat place, andfather said, " I'll takem other andIrenaf irst.  

W e'll walk over there,and I'll takethem behind thefence, and youstay here.  You aream an.  So you 
have tobebrave, andyou stay here. And I'll com e pick you up."  
 
 
Father walked away, and I was am an, I was only 9 years old.  I was scared,terribly scared.  I 
heard som e talk aboutparents leaving children behindand trying to save their lives.  So I ran out 
scream ing " Daddy!  Daddy!  I'm  af raid!"
 
 
Sof atherturned around and cam e back, andthe guard saw us.  Sohe cam e to myf ather,he 
knew f ather, he said, "Mr.
 
Drim er, what are you doing?  You'renotallowed out."   
 
 
Father toldhim  that the ghetto is going to beliquidated.  He wants his children to see the world 
bef ore they have to go be killed, and didn'thave m uch left. Sohetook the jacket off hisback, he 
gave it to the guy, and he said, "Please keepquiet."   
 
 
He alsoprepared the 
pl a c e
 
--
 
there was a wood
-
drying shack, where wood was driedfor 
parquet. Soheprepared a place at the atticof  that shack. Sohe keptus there. W e went up. For 
days on end, butf or weeks we would stay there.  Father would come atnight, bring som efo
od.  W e 
would put a string down and take the wasteawa y.  T his is how we li ved for a while.

>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, I'm m indful of our time, and I know we wantto spend som e tim etalking about 
your stay with the Sawinski f am ily.  Bef ore you describe that,tell about the situation,because your 
father constructed this am azing hiding place in the m iddleof a lum ber yard basically, and you're safe 
therefor them om ent.  But somebody wantedto turn him  in. OK.  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Yes.  We are in the attic,
 
andthe young lady com es to m y father and said, "I 
talkedtoanother young lady, Jancia, and she said that she sees you walking with cansat night, and 
she has this suspicion that youhide som ebody here."   
 
 
She said to the young lady, she said," I have tof ind out what he does and what it is, andI have 
to do what is right."   
 
 
W hat's right was to denounce us sothat shecan geta kilo, two pounds of f lour or two pounds 
of  sugar per person. The Germ ans paidfor people toturn in Jews.  
 
 
My f ather wasf labbergasted.  He says, "What am I going todo?"  Hesharedhis thoughts, 
worr ies with thef riend who is a doctor there,andthe doctor, they both thought, and the doctor says, " I 

know.  I have a plan."  
 
 
T he doctor was educated in Vienna. He spoke and wrote Germ an. He wrote an anonym ous 
letter to the SS stating thathe isanoff iceron
 
--
 
where the off icers go to rest.  R & R.  Hehad an 
encounter with a young wom annam edT heresa,and she inf ectedhim  with syphilis.  
 

 
So the next day, two SS men come to the lum berfactory, lookedher upand took her away to 
the clinic where this doctor was the director.  
 
 
So it was am azing that the doctor had to do som ething against the hypocritical
 
--
 
hippocratic 
oath.  He isnot supposed to hurt people, buthe hadto save thefamily, he had to save thefam ily of

four by making this wom an shut up andnottalk.  
 
 
She was sent to a clinic where she did not have a chance to get outuntil we were liberatedin 
1944. T his was oneof the m iraclesof  survi va l.  But thenfather
 
realized af ter the ghetto was already 
nonexistent, they only had Jews working in these cam ps.  My uncleworked in the ref ineries, oil 
ref ineries. There were several places,three,four, where the workers could still live.  As long as 
father was there,he
 
could supportus,but we knew that very soon the Germ ans will take all the Jews 
outand kill them , shoot them .  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's when your father knew
 
--
  
>> Marcel Drim er:  My father was absolutely desperate.  He really looked very Sem itic.  He was dark 

hair, nose likem ine.  Jewish nose, we call it in Poland.  But he tookoff  his armband and went to 
vil lages, especially to a villa ge, a small village near wherem y m other was born.  He connected with 
people who knew m y m other as a child.  My unclealso knew thesepeople.  
 
 
Father prom ised them  we wil l gi ve them  whatever we still had. W e didn't have much.  T hat 
we'll help them  after the war if  we survi ve.  
 
 
So they f inally said, OK, we'll do it, but we wi ll only take Lauraand Irena. Boys were branded.  
Boys, the Jewish boys were the only m en that were circum cised. So if a Jew managed to run away 

f rom  the ghetto orf rom a cam p, and the Germans were suspicious, they would ask him todrop his 
pants, and if he was circum cised he was guilty of  being a Jew.  
 
 
So thesepeople said,"W e can only take thegirls, only Irena andLaura."   Father says, "W ell, I 
am  ready todo that. W ehave to save whoever we can save."  
 
 
Mrs .
 
Sawinski cam e one night to thedorm itory where m y f ather was livin g with other wo
rk e rs ,

and she said," OK, I'm  ready to go. W e can go, Laura,Irena."  
 
 
You can im aginem y mother'sfeelings that she had to say goodbye to me, sort of  like 
" Sophie's Choice."   You are probably too young to have seenthatmovie.  T his wasm y m other's 
" S op

Mother started crying, and
 
--
 
an d  Mrs .
 
Sawinski was cr ying. W ell, she says, " I can't take itany 
longer."   She says, " Let's take the boy too. W hatever will be wi ll be.  Just take theboy andlet's go."   
 
 
So I was prepared.  I was always prepared. A good scout, I hada little packet of m y reading 
m aterials and things like that. So Mrs.
 
Sawinski tookus there, andwe couldn't go through the streets 
or path, we had to go through the woods so thatnobody would seeus atnight.  
 
 
W e came 
there in thefall of  1943, the Sawinskis' f arm . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa smallf arm, right?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  It was a very sm all
 
--
 
ver y poor people. The Germ an rules were such that the 
farm ers were not allowed to kill a chicken without them  knowing that.  They couldn't kill a pig or 

anything.  TheGermans had recordsof  every living creature your onthatfarm, exceptfor us, of  
course.  
 
 
But we were hiding there f or
 
--
 
the eating situation.  First of all, we could see through the 
cracks on theatt
ic .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were hidden in theattic?  
 

>>
 
Marcel Drim er: W e were in theattic. W ecould see chickens running around in thef ield.  My 
sister would say, "W hy couldn't Ibea chicken?  At least I could run aroundand bef ree before they 

kill m e. W ehave to suffer unbelievablethings."

Now, aboutthef ood,food was rationed and thefam ily, even if  you could buy on theblack 
m arket, if  you buy m ore than yourf am ily needs, this wouldbe suspicious.  T hey would know.  
 
 
First, I must add,f irst we were the threeof  them , then later on there were s
om e other people 
com ing, then m yf ather came, so it was 13of us, 13 Jews.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Sawinskis endedup in their little house hiding13 of you?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  13of us.  Part of us were under the house, andpart of us were in theattic. 
 
T h is  
was a house, a thatched roof house that didnothave a chim ney.  The sm oke would com eout in the 
attic and come out by the sides of the room . 
 
 
So we were there, sitting and getting sm oked, literally getting sm oked. T hen we changedwith 
the people 
inthe hole that wasf ull of water. So nothing was really good.  
 
 
So I just want to tell you how we dealt withf ood. The youngest sonof  the Sawinskis, T adzio, 
would go to thef actory where m y uncle was workin g as a butcher. He would takea bigm ilk co
ntainer 
with him , he would take scrapsf rom the table where the workers were eating, for the pigs, tof eed the 
pigs.  Of  course, we had thef irst cup of thatfood. 
 
Sometimes uncle would give him  a loaf  of 
breador apieceof m eat, endangering his own life.T hey would see,the Germans would see that he 

was gi ving a way f ood,they would kill him  on the spot. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Sawinskis, how m any in theirf am ily?  
 

>> Marcel Drim er:  Four childrenand the two of  them .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sof orthefam ily of  six, the rations am ountf ood was for six?  
 

>> Marcel Drim er:  For six.  T hey had 13.

>> Marcel Drim er:  This was how they m anaged.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Besides thef ood, you describedthe hygiene.  
 
>> M a r c e l  D
rim er: W e bathed once a month. You know the saying about to throw the bathwater out 
with the baby?  You know why that saying

what that saying m eans?  Well, I'll repeatanywa y.  In the 
m edieval tim es people would

a fam ily would bathe,firstthe grow
n -
ups, then the children, then the 
little children, then the water was so dirty thatsom etimes they throw away the dirty water wi th the 
baby.  
 
 
So we were in the same situation.  Parents
 
--
 
we re versed that system. The kids were bathing 
f irst,th en  the  g
r o wn
-
ups, then we threw away the water.  
 
 
W e were inf ested with lice, with bugs, bedbugs, all kindsof m iserable things. W e were sick, 
we were m alnourished.  If it lasted anothermonth or two, we would nothave survi ved.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, you
 
could not getany m edical care. 
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Absolutely.  Absolutely not.  My sister was bleeding, she was ableeder, she was 
bleedingf rom  thenose.  And we only worr ied,W here are we going to bury her? How are we going to 
dispose of the body?  
W e're  lu cky.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  During this time, you were hidden, you couldn't gooutside.  Your whole life was 

inside?  
 
>> Marcel Drim er:  Our whole lif e was either lying do wn or sitting. W ecouldn't even stand up in these 
conditions. W ecouldn't play.  There was no im aginable playf or thekids. W e're notallowed totalk

these 
ref ineries. W e would go out, very rare, on rare occasions, like when theallies were bom bing the

December of 1945, we get a chance to move to the territories that used to be Germ an, because this 
becam eSoviet Union. Drohobych becam eSoviet Union at the tim e.  
 
 
So the Polish people got into, the Polesand Jews got into a couple trains again,except there 
was a little m ore room  than when m y grandparents were taken, andtwo weeks later we landed in 

Lower Silesia and lived in Lower Silesia. W ehadtof ind jobs andeverything.  
 
 
My f ather, andm y uncle, who was thebutcher in Drohobych, was director of am eatfactory.  
T hese guys were intelligent people. T hey wer e capable, but Germ ans let themf eed them selves.  
 

 
W e brought one of  the sons, found him  an apartm ent, and my uncle taught him  butchery.  I am
