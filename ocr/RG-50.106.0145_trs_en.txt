Beginn ing Tape One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Werner Katzenstein
, conducted by 
Esther Finder 
on 
October 17
th
, 2001 in 
Silver Spring, Maryland. 
This interview is part of the 
museum™s project to interview Holocaus
t survivors and witnesses who are also 
volunteers with the mu seum. This is tape numb er one, side
 A.
 And I wanted to start 
by asking you what was 
your name at birth? 
Answer: At birth it was 
Werner Walter Katzenstein
 and curious that the German 
Board of Register said, you™ve got to ha
ve a middle name, and so my  father added 
it. I dropped it when  I became a citizen. 

Q: Where were yo
u born and when? 
A: I was born April 29
th
, 1922 in a little
 towncalled
 Wallensen,
 i-in the county of 
Hamelin
, where -- the 
ﬁPied Piper of Hamelinﬂ? 
Near 
Hannover,
 in that part of 
Germany
. 
Q: Can you tell me about your home
town? Was it big or small, or -- 

A: That was not really my  hometown. My  father was a manager of a farm supply 

busin ess, and in  1922 - ™23, there was the inflation in 
Germany
 and things were 
pretty bad for my  grandparents in the town  of
 Herleshausen
, which is in the center 
part of 
Germ any
 near the city of 
Eisenart
. And my father came in  ™23, and he

again started to form his own busin ess of fa
rm supplies, which was really the -- the 
family business, my  grandfather had it, unc
les had it and th-they dealt with farmers, 
buying and selling. He started his busin e
ss in the -- what was it? A laundry ho-
house that my grandparents 
had. And he got on a bicycle 
and he started to build up 
his own business. That was in 1923. And 
th -the town  was about 1500 people, a 
small Jewish congregation of about 
15 families. My grandfather was the 
Gabbai
 of 
the congregation and I remember on 
Sha bbas
 carrying out the 
aliyahs
 to the 
memb ers o-of the synagogue. And I grew 
up, a relatively normal life, just before 
Hitler
, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of 
Eisenart.
 High school 
was not compulsory , it was voluntary. There 
was a small tuition but not significant. 
I started there ™32, and I went to school by
 train. At the ol -- the s-stu d ents that 
traveled by train, traveled 
in one compar
tment. When 
Hitler
 came to power April 
30
th
, 1933, they kicked me out of the comp
artment, they beat me up through the 
train, they chased me. In th
e beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in th e 
city of 
Eisenart
 for a couple of weeks, and then 
I got back on the train and stayed 
home again. In school not mu ch  changed, th at depended  on th e individual teacher. I 
can say the gym teacher used me to dust 
off the equipment. He made me sit on the 
equipment and he dusted 
[indecipherable]
 with my  gym pants. There were

swimming lessons. We were three Jewish bo
ys in a class, we were completely 
ignorant. So  that was ™33, and th e ne
xt step was my father™s business. 
Q: Let -- let me stop you fo r a just a sec
ond, you™re running a little bit ahead of me. 
I need you to tell me y our father™s 
name and what he did for a living. 
A: My father na -- father™s name was 
Joseph Katzenstein 
an d  my mo th er™s n a me 
was 
Irma
. He eventually built up 
a very good sized business that he had first a man 
with horse and wagon making 
deliveries. Much later on he bought a truck and the 
same man become a truckdriv
er. My mother was in the 
office, she had the office, 
and they sold feed -- seeds, 
to the farmers, and 
also bought grain and so  on from the 
farmers that my father
 sold to the mills. Th
is was -- this is now the early 30™s. In 
1935, the German government -- 

Q: I -- I wanted to ask you one more que
stion about your father before you went 

ahead. Was your father 
ever in the military? 
A: Yes, my father was in World War I. He was in 
Poland
 and he was in a prisoner 
of war camp and he was a 
[indecipherable]
. He said anti-Semitism was there 
already then . He rememb ers a bullet of one
 his own co mrades going past his head. 
He, in 1919, when 
Germany
 ga-gave up, they ju
st got on a train and went home. So 
that was 1919 and I™ll go ba
ck now to the -- ™35. 
Q: One more question, did you ha
ve any brothers or sisters?

A: I had one brother who su rv
ived, and he lives in the 
Detroit
 area. My father™s -- 
the German government prohibited my  father
 to buy grain from the farmer, and that 
stopped the business because the farmer 
could not buy from him any mo re. So he 
made a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to 
[indeciphera ble],
 
which I forgot. 
In 1933, when 
Hitler
 came to power, in our county, every Jewish 
man was put in the county prison. My father
 was in there for about eight, 10 days. 

They were mistreated, but he 
didn™t tel -- talk  too much ab
out it. He wanted to leave 
Germany
 right then and there, in 1933, and my
 mother said here -- I was born here, 
she said, I™m supposed to le
ave? My grandparents said, 
oh he was voted  in, he™ll be 
voted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in 
™35, he -- we had -- the business wa-was 
gone and we had to leave. He decided 
where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries 
weren™t open. He had an uncle wh ich lived  near 
Holland
 and he was able to buy 
two properties in 
Holland
 belonging to  people in 
Germany
. You were only 
allowed to take 10 
ma rks
 out of 
Germa ny
, but he bought two properties in 
Holland, 
and th en we were allowed to move to 
Holland
. This was 1937. And we 
had a boarding house, we had cows. I star
ted farming with a bi
g Belgian horse and 
what else could we do? 
Q: So -- be -- I want 
to stay with -- with 
Germ any
 for just a few more moments -- 
A: Sure.

Q: -- ask a few mo re questions. Wh en you 
were a young child in school, what did 
you want to be wh
en  you grew up? 
A: I always wanted to be an architect, 
there was no doubt about that. I had plan ned 
that well in advance. But I went -- th
e high school that I went to was a 
realsch u le
. 
We didn™t have Latin, so you couldn™t be
come a doctor, but it cou -- you could go 
on t -- to any other education. But then in  1935, wh en we decided that we had to  
leave 
Germany
, I quit school, I was fo -- when I was -- no six -- ™36. I wa -- 14, 
you were no longer -- had ne -- compulso ry
 to go to school, you could go out on 
your own. And since we were going into  fa
rming, I went to work for a gardener and 
learned a little bit there. My father kne
w farming quite well because he advised 
farmers what to do. So when we came to 
Holland
, again, we went into farming.  
Q: Still on 
Germany
. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you walk me through some of 
the changes that th
e Jewish community 
experienced after 
Hitler
 came to power? I -- now -- 
you -- you were -- you can talk 
about the -- 

A: Well, I know this -- 
Q: -- years from ™33 to ™37.

A: I know th is, they had 
Winterhilfe, 
which was they collected
 money to help  the 
poor people, the Jewish cu -- community ha
d to do th at too. My  grandfather, as the 
president of the congregation wa
s in charge of that, and I 
was sent out to collect for 
Winterhilfe
 
[indecipherable]
. We were four or five Jewish children in town and at 
Hebrew school we had a teacher. In t
hose days that one man was a teacher, a 
Chazza n, 
a
 Shochet
, he did everything. And I reme mb er synagogue very well. At 
1928 it was completely remo-modeled becaus
e it was very old, and I -- I remember 
the services and all those things as
 a child. Be -- it was part of me.  
Q: Do you reme mb er reading 
any of the newspapers in 
Germa ny
 wh ile you were 
still living there? Do you remember
 any anti-Semitic literature? 
A: I -- I™m sure we read a daily paper, but
 I-I was too young to really understand or 
to read it, I -- as I said, 
I was 12 -- ™35, I was -- I was 
Bar Mitzvah
 in ™35, and I 
mean, I-I -- I don™t think I read the paper much.  

Q: What were you allowed to take with you when  you left 
Germany
? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What were you -- what coul
d you take with you? You 
personally, wh en you left. 
A: We were allowed to take almo st anythi
ng, and we packed with
 the superv ision of 
the Gestapo. We actually took two railroad 
cars full of farm equipment and things 
we needed in the house. 
I had a stamp collection and they  looked it over, obvious it

wasn™t tremendous. And we got
 almo st ready to  take everything we wanted  except 
they wouldn™t permit my fath
er to take a new car. He wanted to  take a new car and 
they said no way. A -- a little sideli ght. My father was suing the German 
government then, for a tax matter. And th
ey told him, if 
you sue the German 
government, we won™t let you go. So, of c
ourse he had to  drop th at. And then  we 
went to 
Holland
 in ™37.  
Q: Was 
Holland
 th e place that you thought you would stay, or was it a stopping 
point along a -- a larger path? 
A: We lived right along the German borde
r, and my father™s ai
m w as to can you go 
-- continue leaving. I mean, he didn't want to
 stay there. He want
ed to leave in ™33, 
he certainly wanted to  go on. And of 
course, he wanted to take as many 
[indecipherable]
 from 
Germany
 with him. He tried 
South America
, you name it, 
anything. We weren™t registered anywhere
. And he once had permission to go to 

England
 to take -- start a training farm for the 
[indecipherable]
. And wh ile he was 
in 
Amsterdam 
to get his visa, or permit, whatev
er, he ran into a German Jewish 
attorney who knew th
e immigration laws. And he said
, you™re a farmer? You don™t 
go to 
England
, you go to 
United States
. My father said, how can I go to 
United 
States
, I™m not even registered in the quota.
 A skilled farmer w
ill be automatically 
inserted in the quota. So we had to 
present to the American consulate in

Rotterdam
, my  father™s background and we
 got permission to co me to 
United 
States
. A little sidelight here. My mother™s fa
ther, my grandfather had come to us, 
to live with us in 
Holland 
after we had applied to come to the 
United States
, and of 
course we wanted to  take him with us. A
nd sad to say that the American consul in 
Rotterdam
 was anti-Semitic. He told my fathe
r, if he ask s me once more, I won™t 
get you go. So my  gr
andfather stayed in 
Amsterda m
 with a cousin of my father™s, 
and he died a natural death in 1941. But 
the cousin, husband, 
they got killed. We 
left June 9
th
, 1939 
[indecipherable]
 
Amsterdam 
to come to the 
United States
. 
Q: Tell me about the tim
e that you stayed in 
Holland
. How -- how much were you 
aware of what was going on in 
Germany
? 
A: Very much so. As I said, we lived 
along the border, and 
people came to us 
illegally and we had a sort of an underg
round railroad, where we would help the 
people that came in, got a ta
xi for him in the town of 
Arcen, 
where we lived. And 
he would take them to the 
nearest Jewish community in 
Fendler
. And they would 
then help these people to get further into
 Holland
 for -- then they were allowed to 
stay. I mean, we had cases where people we
nt right back. One of the Dutch border 
policemen ha -- was forced to
 put some people back into  
Germany
, and he told me, 
I won™t do th at again. And you know, thin
g -- when they were
 caught they were 
done for. This was right after 
Kristallnacht,
 yeah. Yeah, tha -- 
there wasn™t much

after that. I mean, we got our permission 
to go, we sold our property and -- until 
everything was ordered, til 
we have our tickets.  
Q: How do people know how to fi
nd you on th is unde
rground railroad? 
A: Believe it or not, the German border polic
e helped. They said, 
over there is a -- 
another Jew. He will help you. There were some German border 
police that did that. 
Some came over blind and somehow wound 
up with us. Since we had a board ing 
house in addition to  being farmers -- also 
the Dutch border police would bring th em 
to us while they would try to get permissi
on to stay. One or two did, but mo st of 
them didn™t. I mean, th ey put them across 
the border they could tu rn around, come 
right back. But what really happened to 
mo st of them, we don™t know. I know one 
man, he went back up in 
Vienna
. And we even moved from 
our farm after we sold, 
to another town  near 
Fendler
 called 
Blerick
, and he wrote to Mr.
 Katzenstein
, near 
Fend ler
, and th e letter got to us. I don™t kn
ow whether he survived or not. 
Q: Can you tell me what you heard about
 Kristallnacht 
from where you were? 
A: I was in 
Holland
, I wasn™t in 
Germa ny
, and I know the -- from th e Jewish point 
of view, we were permish -- 
we had permission to do anything. We were -- don™t -- 
didn™t have to observe the Jewish laws about 
Shabbat.
 We just helped the people 
that came. That™s -- I mean, I -- I -- as we 
heard -- of course we heard the news and 
so on, what happened in 
Germany
. That year, ™38, my  grandmother died on the last 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

day of 
Ha nuka h
. And of course my father didn™t go back to 
Germany
. I went back 
-- I was a 1 6  year old and I went back to 
the funeral. I™m here. 
I was -- I came back 
again. 
Q: What was your -- what was your legal 
status as you were 
going back and forth 
from 
Holland
 to 
Germany
 for this fu -- 
A: We were Germans. We were Germans. 
We were German citizens. In fact, we 
had to go to the German consulate in 
Mastreif
 then had the 
J, Jude
, put into our 
passports. We had G-German passpor
ts. Look, our legal status in 
Holland
 was th at. 
When I came to 
United States
 we were enemy aliens. I went into the army as an 
enemy alien. 
Q: When you left 
Germany
, were you able to say good
bye to family and friends? 
A: Not really. There was one German farmer
 who wanted to say goodbye to us, but 
he couldn™t do it openly . And he got on th
e train with us to 
say goodbye and went 
with us a couple of stations and then he
 went back. So  -- but otherwise, there was 
no saying goodbye. The relative -- we ha
d no relatives in to
wn, maybe we said 
goodbye to the Jewi
sh families that were there. By
 the way, I -- the record at the 
Holo caust Mu-Museum, I know th at all the people that didn™t get out shortly after 

we got out, they all got killed.  
Q: Did you have any regrets at all about leaving 
Germany
? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
11
A: Not at all, I™ll give you a -- a 
[indecipherable]
 question. You know, I mentioned 
I was in the American army. And we have
 a reunion -- ma -- the comp any, not the 
division, I was in hundred infantry divi
sion. And we had a re
union and one -- the 
wife of one of my  comrades asked me how -- how -- what did you -- how did you 

feel like fig h ting the Germans? I said, very
 gladly. They would 
have killed me if I 
wouldn't have go-gotten out. No , 
there was no regret about leaving 
Germany
 for a 
second. 
Q: Is there anything about your time in 
Germany
 or in 
Holland
 that we haven™t 
discussed that you™d like to mention be
fore we move into the next stage. 
A: Probably  after you leave I™ll rememb er, which is normal. I mentioned my  

father™s experience, I mentioned our experien ce in
 Holland
. No thing outstanding. 
We had -- we had th e board in
g house and people coming across the border. Ha -- ha 
-- I remember I had to sleep in the haystack
 a couple of nights once because we had 
so many people. Bu t nothing outstanding. 

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in 
Holland
? 
A: No. Not at all. At least we didn™t. My 
wife told you the experience of her father, 
but we have personally -- that personal co
ntact we had was abso
lutely good. I -- I 
don™t -- I could mention so mething, but it™s 
not off the record. You want to stop for 
a second? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
12
Q: No, we-we™ll continue. 
A: Okay. I-I met some
body recently, here, whose moth
er came from the same to wn 
where I lived in 
Holland.
 And it™s a small w o rld, but th -- I didn't k n ow her. I knew 
her family and we -- there are ma ny people 
that we both knew. 
So, she lives right 
here. I haven™t met her yet, we 
just talked on
 the phone.  
Q: When you left 
Holland
, did -- did you have
 any expectations about wh at your 
new home, where you™re going to 
be arriving soon, was like? 
A: No, our aim was to beco
me farmers. Whe -- when and where, we had no idea. 
My f -- they were German Jewish real esta
te agents who took 
you under their wing 
and tried to sell you a farm. We were 
[indecipherable]
 into 
New York
 and my 
father entered a federal land pact in, I think it was 
Somerville, New Jersey, 
and he 
bought a farm from a piece of paper. We
 had -- had three ho
uses. Hadover 120 
acres, 150 acres, and he bought that on a pie
ce of paper. This Jewish Ag ricultural 
Society, we had some money fro -- obvi
ously from selling our property, and the 
Jewish Agricultural Society gave us a s
econd mo rtgage to build a chicken coop. 
There were Jewish people in the area w
ho were very helpful 
and I know there was 
one family, they picked up my 
mother every we
ek to go to 
Camden
 to the 
shircha
 
to go to the butcher store and so on
. I mean they were
 very helpful.

13
Q: Were you helped  by any Jewish agenci
es or were they just individuals who 
helped you? 

A: No, we ha -- no -- the Jewish Agricultur
al Society, but o-otherwise, these real 
estate people were private salesmen an
d they -- they didn't help you.  

Q: Nobody like
 HIAS
 or anybody else?  
A: No, no, we were no
t involved with that. 
Q: Okay. Before we get too 
much into you
r life in the 
United Sta tes
, how did you 
come to the 
United States
, how did you travel here? 
A: In the 
[indeciphera ble]
. Was a new boat. We went th ird class, we couldn™t 
afford anything better, and was the time of
 the World™s Fair and the people were 
coming from all over the wo rld. E-
Eventually, after we w ere in 
New York
 we 

rented a room with somebody in 
Washington Heights, 
and two of my  uncles were 
wor -- had jobs at the World™s Fair and ev
entually we wound up
 -- I said, everybody 
is coming, why don™t we go? In those days
 the subway was a ni
ckel. And we went 
out there to look and the thing that impr
essed me most was the ice w ater dispenser 
at the General Elec -- General Motors exhib
it. That impressed me most. My mother 
was very disappointed. There was a place that
 sold root beer and it didn™t taste at all 
like the beer she expected. 
We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place 
with three houses. The first we moved in to
 one house, good one -- two story, and 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
14
then we sold the two newer houses to je 
-- also German Jewish families that had 
come. One family came from
 Berlin, 
one family came from
 Frankfurt
, and we 
moved in  the old house, which had nothi
ng. The -- the hot water was made on the 
stove in the kitchen. No  heating system. 
Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we 
had a pump in there, and we couldn™t a
fford a deep well pump, so  a plumber came 
and he built a platform in th
e well from which a regular pu
mp could supply us with 
water. There was a Jewish plumber in 
Camden
 who would underwrite a loan so we 
could build a heating system, 
which of course he built. So
 we got a heating system, 
we got hot water and we started farming. At
 first I worked with a team of horses. 
Took a few years til w e could afford a tract
or, but again, we raised chicken feed. 
We grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we
 used for a chicken feed. The salesman 
for the feed dealer sold us our first car. 
This was 1939 - ™40 - 
™41 -- ™40. And he -- 
was oh, I think a ™26 - ™28 
Chev y
 or 
Ford
, whatever. But now we had a car. My 
father had to  get a driver™s license, but that was no problem. And -- 
Q: Tell me how you found out 
that war had broken out in 
Europe. 
How did you 
learn about it? 
A: Oh, we had a radio, we listened to the 
news, we got a daily paper. So we knew 
one what -- knew wh at was going on 
in  the wo rld. And of course
, Hitler
 came into 
Holland
, what was it, we left J
une ninth, he went into  
Holland
 May first. So we 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
15
knew that we got out by the sk
in of our teeth, and we 
could breathe a little heavier, 
although we were worried about the 
[indecipherable]
 that were left behind. I had, 
in the meantime, ™39 - ™40, most of the 
relativ es that were in -- were left in 
Germany
 had gotten out. There was one 
uncle who was interned in 
England
 in the 
Kitchener 
camp, but he got permission to come he
re and he came too. Came to us 

first, working on the farm.  

Q: When  you came to this country, did an
ybody ask you 
about your experiences in 
Euro pe
? 
A: Not that I remember. I -- I didn™t go to 
school, I was 17, I was 
old enough to stay 
out, and maybe I™m regretting it or not, bu
t my  brother went to high school, and 
literally I w ent with him. I had all the books. I learned lot of history, I learned a lot 

of things by just reading. I™m still a -- learning. 

Q: Were you able to keep in touch with
 people that you had left behind in 
Germany
 
when you came to the 
United States
? 
A: In the beginning yes, 
but then when in ™41 the 
U.S.
 entered the war, even postal 
communication was difficult. Eventually the 
ones that were left behind got killed. 

Q: But in the correspondence that you were 
able to get, what kinds of things did 
they write about? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
16
A: Literally nothing. The -- 
look, the mail was censored, 
they knew that. And they 
just that we do fine -- look, I -- we ar
e now translating corre
spondence like that, 
we™re -- a-at the museum, and it™s all -- the 
letters are repetitive. That™s all the s -- 
because that™s all they could tell. 
Q: So you were in your 
late teens and working? Wa
s that something that you 
wanted to  continue to do i
ndefinitely, is -- to do the -- 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Is that what you wanted to do? 

A: Well, fr -- I -- I loved farming, and some
 people can™t understand that, but I did. 
I raised chickens, we grew corn, I worked
 with a tractor and my father built up a 
retail route in 
Ca mden
. And the nearest congregation was in 
Haddonfield,
 
New 
Jersey, 
or 
Haddon Heights, New Jersey. 
And since we were fairly observant, we 
didn't  go to synagogue except at the hi
gh holidays, wh ere we usually went to 
New 
York
 where a -- my uncles lived. 
So we went there. We ha
d some -- some family in 
Philadelphia
 found us, distant relatives and we 
went there occasionally. Like when  
my brother became 
Bar Mitzvah
 on the farm, some -- he went to 
Philadelphia
 to 
get his 
Bar Mitzvah
 lessons, and then from 
Philadelphia 
they 
[indecipherable]
 
for his 
Bar Mitzvah
.

Q: What stands out in your mind about th
e time from ™3 9 when th
e war broke out in 
Euro pe
 until 
Pearl Harbor? 
A: Well, there was really -- I mean, the 
war was going on. We knew that and we 
were very glad that we were in the 
United States
. And I had to register for the draft 
[indecipherable]
 enemy alien. Legally, we were not alle -- allowed to leave 
New 
Jersey
. We weren™t supposed to go to 
Philadelphia
 or anything, and once in aw hile 
we asked fo r a travel permission, but usua
lly we went when we could. And I got 
registered for the draft and my father trie
d to have me deferred because he needed 
me for the farm. But after many, many appli
cations, eventually he was denied and I 
had to -- to register and I was drafted in March of 1944, as an enemy alien. I only 
became a citizen after I was in the army. 
Q: Tell me your reaction to  
Pearl Harbor. 
When you heard abou
t it, what -- what 
did you think? 

A: Oh, I was shocked, of course, absolu  
-- heard it on the radio, and in a way a -- 
this happened, so we™re in -- totally invol
ved now. I mean a -- in a w-way I knew 
that I ha-had  to go in and a -- a -- it wa
s a hundred  percen t American, even th ough I 
wasn™t a citizen yet. And I felt very glad
 th at things had come to that point. 
Q: Tell me about your military
 service. When exactly did you start and -- and what 
training did you receive?

A: Well, I was drafted March 27
th
, 1944, which later on turned
 out to be my wife™s 
birthday. And I was sent 
for basic training to Camp
 Blanding 
in  
Florida
, infantry 
basic. I was classified not for i -- 
outright infantry, but infantry in -- 
I 
and 
R
, 
Intelligence and Reconnaissance. Not that it 
helped any. Was still infantry basic. 
And when that was finished
 I had to report to Fort
 Mead, Mary land
, and 
supposed ly to go to  the 
Pacific.
 But then a rule came out
, anybody over 23 goes to 
Euro pe
 and since I was over 23, I a -- I mean 
a -- over -- I-I was reclassified to go 
to 
Euro pe
. I was then sent to the 
hundred -- to join the hund
red in fantry division in 
Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

A: I joined th
e hundred infantry  division at 
Fort Bragg
 and we prep ared to go 
overseas. We had some more 
training, obstacle course and so -- and so on, under 
fire. And then, eventually, we got 
ready to go. I think, yeah, it was 
Yom Kippur
 
when  we left 
Fort Bragg
 and we went on to 
Camp Kilmer
 in 
New Jersey
. We 
only spen t a few days there. Since I was cl
ose to home I got permission to go home 
a couple of times. But then 
when  we boarded th
e transport and we ar -- and we™re in 
a convoy of the hundred infantry  division. We left about that time, we arrived 
[indecipherable]
 
Gibraltar 
in the 
Marseilles 
area around November first. And 
then we went up through 
the mountains 
t -- into the 
Vosg es 
mountain range. We 
actually went on the line around septem 
-- November first and -- where we relieved 
the 45
th
 in fantry division. We went out on a pa
trol and I think th e patrol of my  first 
platoon was the first comb at action of the 
division. And we went
 back and then we 
got into  comb at from -- attacked a few town
s, took a few town s. And on the sixth or 
seventh Novemb er in the town  of 
[indecipherable]
, I got wounded. You know, the 
saying is you take th e town  and the hi
gh ground beyond it. Th
e Germans were on 
the high ground. We were 
in the town. And I was luck
y I got not -- I got wounded 
and came out to a field hospital -- or a fiel
d hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first 
aid station, then to a field hospital wh
ere they operated on me to remove the 
shrapnel from the wound. It was in my
 buttock. And I remember clearly s -- 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

everyone saying, who do we have here? 
Katzenstein
, pronounced  in perfect 
German. And I was hoping this wasn™t a 
German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the 
next day in a field hospital, believe it or
 not, a German, wounded German prisoner 
of war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I st
arted talking to him. All I have to give 
you is my  name and numb er. He wouldn™t 
talk to me. Maybe he
 thought we were 
pulling a trick, but I was there and then I 
was -- I don™t know, four
 or five, six days. 
Then we were put on a train to get 
to the nearest hospital, I think at 
Besançon
. And 
on that train there were only sitting and walki
ng patients. I couldn™t
 sit. They had to 
put up a stretcher for me in the supply 
car. And I was there a few days. There was 
some movie actress with us, I don™t reme
mber who it was. And as I said in the 
beginning I was classified lightly wounde
d. They  took me now off on a stretcher 
and I stayed  there, I don™t know, a week or
 so. And there they 
sewed up the buttock 
wound. Stayed there, I don™t remember, 
til th ey thought I was well enough. And the 
doctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical offi
cer is out to get you back to the front 
too mu  -- as quick as possible. A docto r was 
try to keep you in 
the hospital as long 
as possible. And this one sa
id, evacuation to the rear.  
Q: To what? 
A: To the rear. And I wound up in  a ho
spital which at one time had been a -- a 
German hospital, a army hospital in the 
Exon Provence
. And stayed there for 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

21
awhile. I remember th ere was a case of a 
German prisoner of war who had lockjaw. 
And somehow th ey found out I spoke German
, so they took me 
and our doctor and 
a nurse into that room. The doctor wanted
 to give him massive dose of antitoxin, 
and I had to translate to the German medi
c what they were goi
ng to do. I really 
don™t know whether the man surv
ived or not. I st
ayed there a little w h ile longer and 
then I wound up again in 
the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for 
KP
 
on Christmas. I had experienced th at on Jewi
sh holidays I didn™t ha
ve to -- to work, 
so I figured here let™s h ave somebody Chri
stian have a chance 
to have the day off. 
So on Christmas I volunteered 
KP
 duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was 
happen -- Novemb er sixth -- around Januar
y sixth or seventh, an d first to the 
kitchen and then they bro
ught me up front. And we were
 in a position right in the 
Maginot Line
. And we were pretty scared to be
gin with. But a infantry platoon is 
40 men when they are full strength. Wh en 
I came back, my  platoon was 20 men, of 
which I knew 10. So  you can imagine wh at
 they had gone through while I was 
away. But from then 
on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more 
experiences, but combat was co
mbat. We went through the 
Siegfried 
line, we went 
down towards 
Mannheim
. One thing, once we were in 
Germany
 we didn™t dig f -- 
dig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle 
experience I had was the city of 
Heidelberg
.
 Heidelberg
 was sort of on a hill at the 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
22
Neckar
 river. And the Germans for some reas
on or other, put up stiff resistance, 
very stiff. Some compan
ies had gotten across the 
Neckar 
river, we were still o n  the 
other side. But then  we had to go across. 
And on broad daylight, under German fire, 
we crossed the river. Not everybody made it.
 Then we went up the hill and through 
the 
Knorr
 soup f-factory that was on top of 
the hill. And the tanks of the soup 
concentrate had been hit 
with artillery. We actua
lly went up the hill in 
Knorr
 
concen trate. And we had to take the factor
y. After we took th e factory, we had then 
take -- fought
 
street by street to take the city of 
Heidelberg
. I mean, the Germans 
were just unbelievable. Then  we had finally
 took the garrison, 
which they were still 
holding. And after we took that
, they gave up -- at the le 
-- what was left, they left. 
And that -- a day or two, I -- later I 
was supposed to go on fu rlough, and I 
reme mb er t h ey  sen t  me b a
ck to battalion headquarters
, and that was the morning 
that President
 Roosevelt 
died. Comp any captain that I knew told  us that 
Roosevelt
 
had died. Went on furlough, first they pu
t us into a German 
town, but then they 
decided no more resort in 
Germany
, and we were sent on to 
France
. Then sp ent 
there a few days, went back -- Passover they
 pulled us off the front line and gave a 
Seder
 in a German hotel. The hundred infa
ntry division had a Jewish chaplain, 
Herbert Eskin
 was the name, I rememb er him well. And we had a 
Seder 
there. 
Wasn™t much of a
 Seder
, you know, but you were aw
ay from comb at for a few 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
23
days, and then we went ba
ck. And I don™t remember th e date when we stopped 
fighting. When we got 
to the outskirts of 
Stuttgart
, we actually went into 
occupation. We occupied a town  here, occupi
ed at town there. And that was the end 
of combat. The war was -- wasn™t over yet.
 I tried to get to military govern ment. I 
mean, I figured I had enough at the end of th e 
[inaudible]
. But -- went to the 

nearest -- no, I wrote to military govern ment. A friend of mine was the sec -- the 

company clerk. And we wrote and they 
sent back, sorry, it has to go through 
channels. So it went through channels
. Company co mma nder who during combat 
wouldn™t let me go, when he came back, he 
okayed my transfer. 
And then I went to 

military government and I wound up in a co
unty right next to the county where my 
father came from. And th -- this was the 
northernmost county in the American zone, 
and that was the first county  in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of 

my father™s that had come back from 
Theresienstadt
. And of course I went to see 
them. And everybody in the 
States
 sent me p ackages for 
them. And then military 
government was very interesting. It was the starting up of German govern ment. 

First we -- they needed travel permission 
for anything they w-
wanted to go. The 
starting of political parties -- at first 
political parties were only permitted on the 
county level, and then, of
 course it spread. And --

Q: Just -- just one moment, le
t™s let this -- sirens pass. 
[tape brea k]
 Okay, we™re 
back, the sirens have passed. 
A: There isn™t much more to tell after that. 
Q: Let me ask a few questions. I wanted
 to know your beginning rank and your 
ending rank of your m
ilitary service. Your ra
nk. Your military rank. 
A: When ? 

Q: No, what was your military rank? 
A: Oh, I -- I was a corporal. They promised
 me more if I would stay. They wanted 
to keep me in the worst wa
y. Wh en  I had en ough points to go home, I went home. 
They  couldn™t keep me another day. 

Q: Did you experience any an
ti-Semitism in the military ? 
A: Not really. There may have been  a few 
guys that were not -- had no experiences 
with Jews, but in combat, there was no question. 
Q: When  you arrived in 
Europe
 for your military service,
 how much did you know 
about what was happening to the Jews? 

A: Well, when we went into co mbat, we 
knew -- this was ™44 -- we knew that there 
were concentration camps and we knew that
 people are -- were getting killed, but 
not that much in detail.

Q: Did you ever read the ﬁ
Stars and Stripesﬂ
 magazine while you were in service? 
I don™t -- 
A: Yes, we got that regularly. And I don™
t think there was too 
much in th
ere about 
it. I don™t rememb er, anyhow. 

Q: Where were you on 
V-E
 day? 
A: 
V-E 
day, I -- we were still -- I was not m
ilitary government yet. We were in a 
town -- I think was 
Kinitling, 
whatever it was called. We were doing occupation 
duty. And we were getting 
ready to be shipped to 
Japan. 
Hundred infantry 
[indecipherable]
 we were supposed to
 go out by way of 
Marseilles. 
And when 
V-
E
 day came we were unhappy th at they 
chan ged our orders, because mo st people 
went to 
United States
 first and then go to 
Japan
, even th ough we we
re supposed to 
go to
 Marseilles
 and then go to  
Japan
, but for us it was over. I mean, the -- we did 
occupation duty. Was interesting, I mean, 
we started schools in -- within our units 

and I taught chicken farming, I taught Germ
an, and we had all kinds of talent. We 
had a guy with a Master™s degree in Englis
h, you name it. The mo st liked class was 
car repair because, you know, that was ev
erybody™s interest. We had all kinds of 
interests th ere and that was very interes
ting. I ran the day room and I was giving 
news broadcasts to the comp
any from what I heard on the radio. But this was now 
™45, you know, the war was over, so th
ere wasn™t mu ch happening any mo re.

Q: When did you realize the fu
ll extent of the Holocaust? 
A: I think I™d -- I- didn™t realize it until I ca
me out of the service, til I came back 
home and really learned of things that ha
d happened. Wh en I came home, th -- of 
course there was more information availabl
e. But during the time in  the service, it 
was not too mu ch. 
Q: Let™s pause again. 
[tape break]
 Okay, we™re back. Appare
ntly there are a lot of 
sirens out there. After the war, while you 
were still doing occupation service, what 
efforts did you make personally to try andfind family or friends who might have 

survived? 

A: I™ll be honest, I didn™t make too many effo rts. As I said, I was in military 
government. I knew -- I found 
out who was killed and where 
the others were that I 
knew by then, and I really di
dn™t make too many efforts. I now feel guilty about that 
at times. 
Q: When  ex actly did you leave
 Europe
? 
A: To come home? Oh, April 30
th
, I guess it was ™46. Was -- my  birthday was April 
29
th
. And my  brother at that time was stationed at 
Fort Dix
, and I of course ha -- I 
went to 
Fort Dix 
to get discharged and our -- my 
birthday present was a Broadway  
show at 
Fort Dix
. 
Q: How had things changed in the 
United States
 when you came back? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

27
A: How what? 
Q: How had things changed in the 
U.S.
 when you came back? 
A: Well, I remember there had been gaso
line rationing and I think there were still 
things being rationed. Things -- the econom
y was trying -- now ha
d to change from 
a wartime economy to a peacetime economy a
nd I think one of the biggest mistakes 
was when people said to go back the wa
y it was before. There was no way of going 
back the way it was before. Th
at didn™t exist any more.  
Q: How had you change
d during your time in 
Europe
? 
A: Well, I sort of, I guess made a p romise 
to myself, since I su
rvived, that I would 
become mo re observant. And I did this 
gradually, I mean from -- during the war, 
everything was permitted, but then I did th
is gradually. I -- at home, on the farm, I 
never did any work  that wasn™t necessary
, even before the wa
r. And now th ere was 
no business on
 Sha bba t
, you know, people didn™t come 
in to buy eggs or things. 
And it got known. My parents were not quite 
as observant as I was, and of course I 
became even more observan
t when I got married. 
Q: How did you meet your wife? 

A: Blind date in
 Brooklyn
. She doesn™t like it when I gi
ve the complete story, so I 
won™t. If you want to take it off the record, 
I™ll take it off the record. I can™t do that 
to her. 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

28
Q: I don™t want to get in any trouble here
. Just tell me b riefly, what -- what was 
your wife™s background? Was she born in this country ? 
A: She was -- when I met her 
she  was a legal  secreta ry in 
New York
, and when  she 
came to 
Vineland
 there was an attorney in th
e neighborh ood who asked her to 
come in to help. She stayed 
there for quite a few years to
 help. And when I came to 
Vineland
, I w o rk ed  fo r my  
in-laws. They  had -- my  father-in-law and his brother 
had a -- a big farm at -- a ch
icken farm, at first. And th
en when  the ch icken business 
went, as they say in Yiddish, 
indra ya
, he sw itched to dair
y farming because he, 
after all, that was his experience, too. We -- 

Q: I have to  ask you to translate. I know wh
at that mean s, but you need to translate. 
A: Oh, it means, in the 
[indecipherable]
 literally translate, in the 
[indecipherable]
 
it™s just done for. The reason for this was th
at, you know, all these people that came 
out of the camps and had came to the 
United States
, chicken farming was a very 
attractive business. You didn™t have to sp
eak English with the chickens. And the 
only way at the end that the feed dealers 
could compete with each other was well, 
they extend more credit. A
nd when  that done, overexten si
on of credit, with no help 
from the
 U.S.
 govern ment, chicken business went down the drain. So  my  father 
then went to dairy farming. We converte
d chicken coops into cow stables and I was 
able to do most -- I w as able to do pl
umbing, you name it. You do ev erything

yourself. We had hurricane
s. Oh yeah, hurricane 
Hazel
, and -- destroyed in our area 
many chicken coops. In 1955 I decided 
I couldn™t make a living on th e farm, 
because my wife™s paycheck ha
d to go to the feed dealer 
to pay for the feed bill. So, 
my  father had a small route, detail route in the 
Ha ddo nfield, Ha ddon Heights
 area
, 
Cherry Hill
 came just in existence. So I decide
d in ™55, I™m going to start knocking 
doors. And after a year or two I bu
ilt up my own route and I built up my own 
busin ess, and work ed well.  
Q: Just for the record, what 
-- what™s your wife™s full name? 
A: 
Inge Eva Ka tzenstein
.  
Q: Do you have children? 

A: Yes. We have three childre
n. We have our oldest son, 
Michael
 lives in the 
Boston
 area, has two boys. Our second one, 
David
 lives in 
New Jersey.
 He has five 
children, four girls and a bo
y, and our daughter lives in 
Pittsburg
 and sh e has a 
daughter and a son.  

Q: I wanted to ask you about so
me of the historical events. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 wh at? 
Q: Historical events since the wa
r. How closely did you follow the 
Nuremberg
 
trials? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
30
A: As close as I could here, in the news 
I mean. And I knew some of the people that 
were being tried, I am -- I knew their 
backgrounds, you know, from experience. 
Ribbentrop
, 
Papen
, I mean all -- I knew the German governments then, and I 
knew who did what, and we knew  who was 
lying. And I was not asked, you know, 
to get involved. I mean, I know people that 
did, but I followed it. Look, what™s his 
name? 
Ribbentrop
 was the foreign minister. A cousin of my mother™s was an
 ob-
gyn
 in 
Berlin
, he delivered 
Ribbentrop™s
 son. Was in those days -- later on, Pope
 
Pius
 the 12
th
, who was in 
Berlin
 at that time, my mother™s cousin knew him. H-He 
worked in a Catholic hospital. I mean, this was ™37 -- 
™36 - ™37. He got out, but that 
had nothing to do with it. 
Q: Did you feel that ju stice was d one at 
Nuremberg
? 
A: Yes. They -- I think they did go -- very
 well that -- I don™t think they let many 
stay alive that should
 have been killed. 
Q: Also, in -- at around that same  time period, the 
U.N. 
debated on the partition of 
Palestine. 
Was that something that wa
s of interest to you? 
A: Yes, that was of interest to me, because 
after all, we did want a Jewish state. And 
at the time that seemed to be
 th e only way possible to get it. And of course, the rest 
is history. What™s happeni
ng now we all know very well. 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein

31
Q: There are some things that happened  
in this country , a-after the war -- you know, 
in years since the war. The 
Korean war and the war in 
Vietna m
. Did these have any 
impact on your life? 
A: Well, I followed them as much as I could. Whether they were justified, I don™t 
know. Did -- I gave them thought, wh -- 
ho -- whether we did too mu ch, or not 
enough, I don™t know. 

Q: Also in this country, 
I wanted to  ask you about the Civil Rights movement. 
Given your personal background, how did you
 feel about what was going on in this 
country? 

A: I am for the Civil Rights 
100 percent. I know this, in the army  basic training, one 
of the lieutenants I worked wi
th  was a college professor from 
Georgia
, and I 
questioned him, how ca
n you treat the negroes like this
? And he says, the negro has 
to stay in his place. I mean, of course 
I didn't agree with hi
m, but who was I to 
argue? He was a college professor. Bu
t the Civil Rights
, absolutely.  
Q: Did you follow the
 Eichmann
 trial in 
Jerusalem
? 
A: Oh, whatever we are able to hear here, yes. 

Q: Did you feel that the way it was reported 
here in this country was -- was fair and 
objective? 

 
Interview with Werner Katzenstein  
 
October 17, 2001 
 

 
 
32
A: I -- I really don™t know. They did s -- re
port as much as they
 wanted to. Look, I 
know a friend of mine here started 
an organization to protest to the 
Washin gton™s 
Post
 anything th at they repor
t that™s detrimental to 
Israel.
 So I-I mean we -- the 
papers do one thing and not always what 
we like. Look, what™s happening between 
our government and 
Israel
 right now is ridiculous at times. 
Q: Is there anything else that you wanted
 to  share about your professional career? 
Because I have some questi
ons about your retirement. 
A: Well, I enjoyed it. You know, I built up
 a retail route, 1955
, and knocked doors 
and ev entually got acquainted 
with an awfu l lot of people, and I think in  many cases 
I became a member of the fam
ily. At first we were pare
nts talking about children. 
They we were talking about par -- child
ren™s education, and ev entually about 
children™s going out and gr-grand
children. So -- this is, by th
e way is not just -- that 
I had just Jewish customers. I knocked door
s to door an d I sold chickens and eggs 
and you name it, and I enjoyed it. 
Q: When  did you move to 
Washington, D.C.
? 
A: I guess it was -- be in to -- I think December ™98. 
Q: And why did you move here? 
A: There were several reasons. Number one
, my wife™s mother 
had been mentally 
deteriorated, and we ha -- and physica
lly also. We had her in a home in 
Atlantic

City. 
And th en, my  sister-in-law lived here fo r over 20 years, and she™s said the 
home here in 
Wa sh ingto n
 is much better, so we had he
r transferred to the Hebrew 
home. And for me again, one of the persona
l reasons, I tried to slowly  liquidate my  
busin ess. I™d gotten to a point where I 
was making many monthly deliveries, ma ny 

deliveries twice a month, and when  I 
decided I was going to go only monthly 
deliveries, then we decided to co me here
. Also religious reason. The synagogue in 
Vineland
 where I went to on 
Sha bba s
 closed down . And th e oth -- there was 
another synagogue but on 
Sha bbas
 I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a 
little too old for that. And then here, where 
we moved to, I have 
a 10 minute walk to 
synagogue. We are walking distance tofour different Orthodox synagogues and -- 
and from a kosher point of view ev erything 
is right at your fingertips. I™m enjoying 
it. 

Q: How did you get involved with the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial 
Museum? 
A: My brother-in-law
, Kurt Pauly
 had volunteered there already for a number of 
years, and we decided, if we can contribu
te something, we can. And yes, they could 
use people that translated 
German into English. And we
 got and they were very 
happy to have us. And we™ve been doing th is 
now for a long time. We go in at least 
one day a week and it™s sometimes not so nice to do what we™re
 doing because we

can read between the lines how peopl
e are suffering, and most of the 
correspondence that we transl
ate is of people that did not survive. And I™m very 
glad we™re going. 
Q: Do you speak publicly 
about your experien ces? 
A: We ha -- didn™t volunteer at the mu seum for the speaker™s bureau, we haven™t 
been asked. Yeah, I think we volunteere
d once, but we haven™t been asked. Our 
former next door neig hbor is
 a schoolteacher here in the 
Montgomery County,
 or 
Ho wa rd Co unty
, I don™t know. And she arrangedfor us to speak to a public 
school, one day not long ago.
 And it was something we enjoyed, and th e children 
enjoyed, and th -- there were a lot of qu
estions. I guess they were 10 or 11 year 
olds, and they -- I guess that they had seen -- what is it, the 
David™s 
world, or 
something th ey had seen. Or -- 

Q: 
ﬁDaniel™s
 
Storyﬂ? 
A: Yeah, or -- no, also 
Anne -- Anne Frank.
 They knew about th
at and they asked 
us many personal questions and we 
enjoyed it. Look, we were in 
Germany
. The 
city of 
Co lo gne
 invited people, and we were ther
e, I guess it was ™86 - ™87. And 
they bent over backwards to
 supply us with kosher fo
od and so on. And there also 
we wa -- we asked to speak to schoolch
ildren, school students. And we asked to

higher school students. And there the 
questions were, of course, comp letely 
different. And the point I always 
made is -- how shall I say it? 
Q: I™ll pause. 
[tape break]
 Okay, we™re back, now that you™ve collected your 
thoughts. 
A: The point that I made was repeating 
something that a Germ
an  ma y o r  to ld  me 
while I was in military government. A
nd this was 1945. And he said, Mr. 
Katzenstein
, I hope that the occupation stays he
re until this generation is dead. And 
this is what I repeated to
 the German high school students, because many of them 
told us, my mother 
is still a Nazi. I mean, this was 
now ™87. So this is what a 
German mayor told me, and that wa
s sort of the point th at I made. 
Q: I™m going to pause and ch ange tape.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Werner Katzenstein
. This is tape number two, 
side
 A.
 And you were telling me about your -- your visit to 
Germany
. Was that the 
only time since the war th
at you™ve been to 
Germa ny
? 
A: Yes. No, no, we were recently, but th
at had no connection. We were back 
recently going to 
Belgiu m,
 going to  
Germany
, and to 
Amsterdam
. This time, my 
sister-in-law, we went together again, th
e two couples. And our oldest son came  to 
Colo gne
 and to -- they went from cemetery to 
cemetery to look up the places where 
the family, my wife™s fam
ily came from. And we went
 to the house where my 
mo ther-in-law was born and you know, many pl
aces like that. We went to the house 
where my wife grew up. 
But that was just recently
. When I was back in 
Germany
, 
that was the city of 
Co log n e
 and they invited people that were born in the 
Cologne
 
area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- fro m 
U.S.
 and 20 from 
Israel.
 That was a 
very interesting experience, but I don™t th
ink it showed us much
, that the Germans 
had ch anged that mu ch. I know this, Friday 
night they  took us to
 synagogue by bus 
and then we walked back 
to the hotel. And they ha
d two men walking bus -- us, 
officially that we wouldn™t get lost. I thi
nk it was for security reasons. They were -- 
in ™87, I mean there™s -- 
Germany
 is still you don™t feel a hundred percent secure.

Q: Is there anything that you and I have 
not spoken  about today th at you would like 
to add before we conclude? You had some 
thoughts before that you were kind of 
working on.  
A: I really can™t think of anything specif
ic that didn™t come up -- you know, a few 
things did co me up, but as I 
said before, going back to 
Germany
 was nothing 
joyful. Yes, when  I came home somebody
 said, how was it going back to your 
home? Coming back to  
New Jersey
, that was going back 
home, not when I was 
over there. Yeah, we came back, I went ba
ck  to farming. My brother, by that time 
was in college and he -- he took chem
ical engineering. He found quickly 
engineering was not for him. He went -- 
he became a chemist 
and he™s doing well. 
Q: All right, if -- if you have noth
ing else t -- nothing else to add? 
A: Can™t think of anything at this mo me
nt. Probably after your gone 10 minutes. 
Q: Okay. I thank you very 
much for speaking w
ith me today, and then this will 
conclude the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Werner 
Katzenstein
. Thank you.
