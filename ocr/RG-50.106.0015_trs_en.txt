Q: So yousaid that yourfriends, some of yourf riends,and your teachers werenot 
Jewish, but you don™t recall any anti

Sem itic incidents. It wasavery pleasan

A: Yes.W ell, pleasant, perhaps. But you know, when m y father had all his business 

difficulties,a child fears thateven iftheydidn™t talk inf ront ofme, but I knew there 

was something going on.AndI had to inherit the10,000 Cz
ech crowns f rom  a great 
uncle of mine. And so, I knew that m y father needed money, so I offered him  m y 

10,000 crowns, whichI™m sure would havebeena drop in the bucket.So, youknow, 

I remem bered this. Buthe lost his businessandm y m other™sbrothers to

Q :  A l r i ght , s o i t ™s  n o w 19 38 .
 
A: Yes, but there™s a big event before that. My father had lung cancer. And he died 

in1936, when I was 16yearsold. Andthat was very hardonmebecause I was very 

close to m y father, much more so than to m y mother. 
 
Q:And how did that change your life and yourmother™s life?
 
A :  W ell, 
m ymothertried tomakea living by renting out a room  totwo girl students. 
She did all sorts of things. She had a representation

no, you don™t say that. Anyhow, 
she sewed, knit woolen materials tof riends and gota comm ission onthat. And then

t ha t t hey we r e sen t b y m y m o th e r an d she go t a pe rce nt a ge f rom  th at . S o m y m othe r 
was very capable,althoughshenever really worked.But she was very intelligent and 

very prac
tical. And although there probably was some money, m y father hadn™t left 
anythingbecause we just lived onhis salary. ButI thinkmy mother inheritedmoney 

f rom  he r m ot he r . And I k no w s he ha d st oc k s i n th eb an k be cau s e I u se d to go wi th 

her to collect the
 
coupons. But she always made an effort to earn some m oney 
herself.
 
Q:So that was 1936.Anything in 1937 that you recall?
 
A : W e l l , I wa s

you mean as far as anti

Semitism?
 
Q :  O r  per s ona l l y?
 

A:W ell, I was sent toSwitzerland thatsummer, intoa French
-s
pea k i ng f am i l y.
 
Q:W hatdid you know about Hitlerat that point?
 
A:W ell, we knew quite a bit. Perhaps not I, but m y mother had a very close friend in 

Germany, in Oldham  (ph).And this woman came tous oncea year, usually, andmy 

mother went to visit her.
 
An d she sm u ggl ed out  s om e m one y f rom  Ger m a n y bef o r e 
t he y im mi gr at ed to A r ge nt i na .So we  kne w wh a t wa s go in gon th e re .A nd th en,  a l so, 

Hitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of m y mother™s brothers lived in Vienna. So 

they all imm igratedf irst to Czechosl
ovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted 
t o ge ta  vi s a to s om ep l ac e els e. An d th e ydi d  e ve nt ua l l y go to Fr an ce a ndf rom  

France to unoccupied France. And they got to America maybe 1940, 1939 or ‚40.
 
Q: Do you remem ber being particularly f rightened in 1
9 38?
 
A: Not really.But that wasperhapsbecauseIwas so naive, you know? I grew upin 

a veryprotected way.AndI was rather childish at that age. Andm ymotherused to

that we had to walktothe school at night, when it wasdark, so thatthe

three and a half  yearswhenI was in Persna (ph), I always thought itwould be better 
in the next place. So optim ism  helps, I think, but it™s the optim ism of youth.
 
Q: So you arrived at Theresienstadt.
 
A:W e arrived at T heresienstadt and were put into barracks, you know.
 
Q :  Yo u and  you r m o
ther were stilltogether.
 
A: Yes.W e were still together.Andfirst, we were inthe smaller room.I think we were 

the first people in this particular barracks.

A:Aname.They called it ___________, which wasa spelli

in  E n g l i s h ,  it™s  
The Raisin, isn™t it? So it was called DresdnerBarracks.And this was strictly women™s 

barracks. The men lived in the Sudatin barracks.

we  s l ep t on  th e f lo o r,  of c ou r s e.  A nd I ™ l l te l l  yo

started to disappear from  our luggage. And we couldn™t understand it

or I certainly 
couldn™t understand it.AndI rem emberasking m ymother, ﬁMother,do youthink that 

Jews steal?ﬂI couldn™timagine that Jews w
ould steal one f rom  the other. I learned 
muchbetter later on. ButI eventually worked in thepostoffice. You will laugh about 

the post office. It was like that in thefirstfew months atT heresienstadt.T he Czechs 

believed in the town.And we were inthe
 
barracks and were not allowed out. But 
t he r e were som e pe op le  who  we re a l lo we d out , l i ke  t he gua r d

not guards. They 
were the ghettopolicemen who watched over each barracks. And they could goto 

their adm inistration Ithink.There were certain people who wereallowed out. But I 

think June1942, theCzechs still lived intheir housesthere.T hen they were 

e va c ua ted an d th en the  ghet to  wa s ope ne d, yo u  kno w. T hen  we  c ou l d go ou t.But 

we  l ef t so on af te r t hat  so I d id n ™t e xper i en ce tha t. B ut as  lon g as  we wer e co nf in ed to  

thebarracks,I worked. Every barrackshada post office, which was a room.And 

since the men were separatedf rom  their wives and children,they wr ote letters to

Czechoslovakia they were usedtofeed the ca

but I think so. And I didn™t tell m y m other, but when she heard this and I told her 

eventually, she volunteered to goalongon thetransport because shefelt we 

shouldn™tbe separated, which we later were.

after they got allthe Jews in Czechoslovakia toTheresienstadt.Andwe did this so, 

youknow,everyday we wentfor supper to an inn in the country.There were various 

places inBohem ia where wedid this work. But in that place where 
I  wa s  wi t h m y  
mother, we went to supper everyday to a certain inn.Andthere we talk to theowner 

of the innand askedhim  whether it wouldbe alright if we hadapackage sentto him, 

to his address. And we always told the people to whom  we wrote what name
 
t o  wr i t e  
us, to senda 
--
 
by then, we recognized whichwasf orus, youknow?Because other 
people didthe same thing.And so wecollected quite a bitoffood, which webrought 

back to Theresienstadt.
 
Q:Okay,now what kindof workdid you do for six weeks? You plantedtrees?
 
A :  T r ee s,  yea h.
 
Q:W as thathard work?

There was, for instance, a transport f rom  Vienna where a sister of my grandm other™s

W or d of  m o uth ?
 
A:Probably word ofmouth, yeah.By that time, we wereallowed togo out,andso 

we wentto visit her. Shedied soonafter that,fortunately.But by that time, 

Theresienstadt was full, full of people f rom  everywhere. Germ any, and also, I don

was a rumor it wastoPoland,but we didn™t really know. Andthem ost important thing 

in Theresienstadt laws, to have connections to get out of a transport, not to have to 

go.Because thereat least, we knew what wehad.And we did not know what was 

waiting for us. So m other and I got into transport twice, I think. And once, I had a

A:W ell, there wasa big sort of washroom .Since it wasthe barracksfor soldiers, 
there werem aybe 20spigotsthere where you washed withcold water. And you 

know, I don™t remember anythingabout the toilets.They musthave had lots 
o f  to i l e ts. 
Anyhow, Idon™t rem ember any hardship with toilets there.Andat leastwe hadplenty 

of  cold water.Thefunny thing was that, you know in Europe,peopleput their bedding 

into the windows to air out. Everyone does, all over Europe. And we did i

Theresienstadtbecausethere were sortof, what do you call them?
 
Q :  A r ch wa y?
 
A: Yes.Arches.T herewas a walkway tothe various room s andthenthose archways. 

And weput ourbedding outthere to air everymorning. Maybe that™s why we didn™t

said that he knew the man who was the guy, the top m an on the transport. And he 

would tell him  about m e, that if he needed any help, a secretary or whatever, that he 

recommendedm e. And then we wereput intoa separate barracks, those who went 

on the transport, and where they, again, I think for three days. And m y m other m et

No,before we got outof thetrain, they cam ein and they distributed postcards. And 
they saidthat we couldwrite hom e;that we were working in agricultural environment,

me. Heused it inhis work asand architect.Andhehad givenme that with rolled up

then, youknow, the clotheshad tobe sorted into,I don™t know, dressesand shoes 

and whatever. And thoseSSpeople took them away by andby. But we foundfood 

there, too,so we cookedforourselves, you know, wef oundalcohol stoveson which 

we could cook.And we justused them. Andwe found ourown things, of co
