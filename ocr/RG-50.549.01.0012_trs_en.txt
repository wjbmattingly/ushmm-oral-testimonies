LEONARD ZAWACKI  
June 29, 1996 
 

Dee Roberts: This is Dee Roberts. I am 
speaking with Leonard Zawacki and this is the 
first tape and it™s June 29
th
.  We wanted to start off with 
what your family life was like 
before the war.  And if you could go into
 a little bit about the home life and your 
upbringing.  
Leonard Zawacki:   Well I, I was born in north
western part of Poland.  In the town of 
Grudziadz which before the First World Wa r was 
under the German oc cupation or it was part of 
Germany. And I went to school, to
 high school. I finished the high 
school and then I started my 
studies in Warsaw in economics.  Wh ere it wa
s called Central School of Commerce. In Wa rsaw. 
 The war of course interrupted my studies. 
 And in 1938 I was conscr
ipted. I had to serve 
in the, in the arme d forces and I was si nce I 
was a student I was taken 
to the cadet officers 
school, reserved cadet officers school. 
 

Q:  May I ask how ma ny pe ople in your 
fa mily, your brothers
 and sisters.  
 

A:  Well I only have a sister, my father and 
mother. We had a house in Grudziadz really. I 
could say that we were quite comfortable and my sister was ma rried. She ma rried a judge who I 

think district judge or whatever
 they would call it.  In my ho
me  down. And he was also called 
up.  He was a reserve officer and when the war broke out 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  2 
 
 
he was called up and he was taken prisoner of war 
 and he spent the war 
years in a prisoner of 
war camp. In Germany.   

 

Q: What did your father do? 

  

A:  My father an engineer, a 
railroad engineer.  And as I 
said, the I had quite a good life, 
really.  You know with ma ny friends and 
was enjoyed, was enjoying my life. And 
 

Q:  Did you have, was there very
 much religious upbringing in 
 

A:  I, well I was brought up as a Catholic 
but although my mother
 was probably quite 
religious. There never was any pressure on me  to, to
 if there was any pressure was exerted it was 
rather by the school than by my parents. But I, I am not a very religious person.  And well that™s 

about all about my life.  

 Of course the war interrupted everything.  And 
as I said I was, I wa
s serving in the cadet 
officers school. When t he war broke out and I 
went to war.  Although I was supposed to be 
released from the school because the school onl
y took one year.  And I was supposed to be 
released in October, but the war br
oke out on the first of September 1939. 
 And I took part in the defense of Warsaw
 and was taken prisoner of war.  And in 
Warsaw on the 27
th
, 28
th
 actually of September. And from
 there, from the transport to 
the prisoner of war camp, I did escape and I 
came to my home town.  And to see my 

parents. And there I came sometimes in Oct
ober of 39.  And then 
at the end of October, 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  3 
 
I was arrested by the local German units 
of serve protection units.  They called 
themselves 
Zedshuts
 and these were Germans, because my home town had a minority 
German minority of approximately  10%.  Th
ey™re in a minority and once the Germans 
invaded, right away they were very well 
organized and they formed self-protected units 
and two fellows arrested me and I was taken as a hostage. 
 And I spent the next few weeks as a hosta
ge and later was rele
ased under the condition 
that I leave this territory. Y
ou know that I was undesirable pe
rson.  Because these territories 
where incorporated into Germa
ny.  And I was evicted to the cen
tral part of Poland which was 
German occ upied but not incorporated into Germany.  And I went to Wa rsaw. 
 

Q:  Let™s fast forward.  They wanted to know a 
little bit about your fa m
ily life but also what 
happened after you escaped from Ausc
hwitz. So if we could fast fo
rward to that time and I just, 
I™m interested in what, after you esca
ped, what was your life like then? 
 

A:  After I escaped, well once we escaped we
 did have, we were in touch with the 
Underground which was in the vicinity of Au
schwitz. And we were taken over by Underground 
people and directed from there, to the partisan
 units which were in southern Poland.  In the 
mountains. 

 

Q:  Where is that? 

 
A:  Oh it, the towns whic h the bigger towns were 
Kenti 
and then (pause) the 
mountains were the range was the Carpathi
an range but this particular part was called 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  4 
 
Beshid Zahodni
, the western 
Beshid
 and one of the bigger, biggest mountains there 
was 
Bialia Gora
  and the other town I ju
st can™t think of it at
 the moment, the name.  
And it starts with Z.   
 I will remember. It will come
 back to me. Oh yes, 
Zeviets
. It was 
Zeviets,
 near 
Zeviets
.  And there were approximately 100 parti
sans, of which approximately  20, 20 
were escapees from Auschwitz.  And we 
als o had approximately ten Russians and the 
Russians were, who either parachutists who 
were dropped. There were 3 of them. Then 
there were some pilots who were shot 
down over Germany. And they escaped and 
came, joined us. 
 And then there some escapees from prisone
r of war camps. Altogether we had ten. But 
our unit, the partisan unit was sponsored by the 
Polish legitimate government which was at that 
time in London. You know after, after the fall of Poland some of the governme ntal offices all 
moved, first to France. And after the fall of Fr
ance, they went to England. And England was a 
legitimate Polish governme nt which was the cont
inuation of the government, of the prewar 
governme nt.   

 And we were sponsored by them and by the 
English of course. And there were drops 

ma de in Poland you know of a mmunition and othe
r ma terials.  And so we were supported by 
them.  Of course, when the Russian front moved and to Poland, the Russians also established 

their own governme nt you know Polish government. A
nd they also had their own partisan units. 
And since we were sponsored by the governme nt in, in England, in London, we were again when 

the Russians came, we were the enemies of the, of the Russians because we  were not communist 

sponsored. 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  5 
 
 And before when the, the we when the, the front came quite near and we knew that any 
time they Russians would be there, we separate
 the Russian prisoners who were with us, the 

partisans. We told them that they are on th
eir own now. And, and afte
r that we dispersed 
ourselves because we knew that if the Russians came  they would deport us to, to Siberia. 

 

Q:  I™m very curious about what your activities 
were like before that 
happened, what your life 
was like, the daily kind of. You 
were living in the mountains. 
 

A: Well the, the really lived mostly and we m
ove d only by night.  And day time we did sleep and 
we slept in the open.  Many times we slept on 
the bare ground and when we woke up in the 

evening you know we were covered 
with snow.  And it was very tough. It was not an easy life at 
all. Later on when in January, end of December 
and January when it became  very cold, we took 
over how do you say, a hunting lodge which was d
eep in the mountains. And we did ma ke a 
tunnel from there because it was close to a stream.  

 From the stream we made a tunnel to get 
into the hunting lodge.  So that nobody could 
see whether there was any move me nt, the move ment
 went through the tunnel and we stayed in 
this, in this hunting lodge. And our
 activities were we were, you have to reme mber that this part 
of, where we were and also Auschwitz itself wa
s incorporated into Germany.  It was German 
territory.  They claime d it as German. And ma ny 
of the inhabitants, Polish inhabitants were 

evicted.  And ma ny of the farms and so on and bi
g estates where the Polish owners were evicted 
and Germans were brought in from deferment pa
rts of Romania and Latvia, Lithua nia because 
the Germans were straight and even Russia ther
e were German people living in Russia, in the 

Volga region.   

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  6 
 
 And they were brought in there.  So our m
ove me nts we had difficulty in move me nt.  But 
we did also undertake some  wher
e we intercepted some  prisoners
 and we, I know of, of only one 
instance where we intercepted two Polish  prison
ers while they were taken from one place or 
from one camp taking to the ma in camp. They were
 intercepted by us and taken. And they were 
freed.   

 Well how it was done that they
 were convoyed by guards, by 
 two guards, two prisoners 
and from the sub camp to the ma in camp on the way they were approached. We  had unifor ms. 

We also had SS unifor ms and we approached 
them and we told them. that we were 
representatives of the camp Gesta
po, or the political  departme nt 
and that these two prisoners are 
needed for interrogation.  And we signed the papers an gave to the guards and they released them 

and we took them over. And they came  and joined the partisans. 

 It so happened that they didn™t, one of them
 anyway didn™t survive. He was later on killed 
in an action. Where matter of fact
 I had another friend of mi ne  came the night before to this safe 
house. And we left next night a
nd in the morning this house wa s surrounded and one  of the, the 
one prisoner who was released by us was the, there 
were actually four of 
them and they were all 
killed with the exception of one. 
 Wh o hid in the basement  of 
the, of the house and while the 
Germans tried to flush them out they were th
rowing grenades into the baseme nt, he always 
picked up the grenade before it expl oded and  th
rew it in the next part of the baseme nt.   
  And then he buried himself in one corner  of the, of the baseme nt there was you know 

potatoes, when they grow and I don™t™ know to 
do, how do you describe them. Potato and they 
have light you know they start growing.  And peopl
e in order to prevent it you know they take it, 

take these parts off. They grow and he buried hims elf in there.  So when the SS came  they knew 

that there we re four prisoners 
or partisans and they only could 
account for 3.  And finally one of 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  7 
 
the SS people had an idea that to look ther
e whether some body is buried under this, I don™t™ 
know how to call this, this out
growth of the potatoes.   
 And they discovered him so they took hi
m. They bound his hands behind him.  With a 
belt.  And put him on a truck and were driving 
him to the camp. Some how when he was sitting 
there in the truck he loosened his hands and 
jump ed out of the truck you know and while he 
jumped out on the road, he hit hi s and broke hi
s collar bone  and smashe d his face. But picked 

hims elf up a nd he run on the road. Before they st
opped the truck, he got away. And he survived.  
Matter of fact he lived in Cana
da in Edmonton.  And last year he
 died. He  had a heart condition.   
 So he was very lucky, he was very lucky. 

 

Q:  These were typical of your e
xperiences then right before the Œ 
 

A:  Now we did  what did we, you see we, we 
caught, we couldn™t and we didn™t™ want to kill 
you know unnecessarily. We  ha
d opportunities to you know kill the Germans but the 
repercussions  would be so, so great that it 
you know that only the unarmed civilian population 
would be suffering.  We  didn™t want
 that.  But what we did since some  of t he big farms  were 
taken over by the Germans who were brought out fr
om different parts of Europe, we did tell 
them that they will have to move out. We were 
harassing them.   And we were also blowing up 
you know bridges and railway jun, there was  railwa
y junctions. That™s what we, but we were not 

intent to killing individuals 
because we knew that there woul
d be great repercussions you know 
to the Polish c, 
civilian population. 
 So we, we tried to avoid that.   But of c
ourse I was only 4 mo nths in the partisans since 

my escape. And we also of course we had to 
feed ourselves. What we you know we, we raided 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  8 
 
some  of the German stores you know for the food 
which we needed.  We  also took cattle from 
the German far ms and so on because we needed to
 feed ourselves.  But th
e life in the partisans 
was very, very hard.  Very, very tough indee
d. And ma ny times we also we nt hungry. If we had 
to if we couldn™t get any food 
from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the 
Polish peasants but we paid for it cause we had 
funds for this.  And we didn™t want to anybody to 
suffer. 

 Now there were, we did have well I can tell yo
u one instance where we did ma tter of fact, 
I and three other. I was in charge of this acti
on. We went, we were always very close to the 
Auschwitz concentration camp.  Quite close. We
 you know we and one day actually one night 
we went and we, we had to do some thing and then
 on the way back we were rather tired. It was 
late at night and I said let™s 
knock on the windows of a hut and 
let™s hope that these are Polish 
peasants.  As it happened, he was a Polish p
easant and did knock on the windows and he came 
and we told him who we  are and 
whether he could give us a lift
.  Through the mountains. It was 
quite a di stance  to walk. And he said oh yes.  
He will and he ri ght away he got dresse d and he 

went to the stables and he you know
 harnessed a horse and to the sl
ed and we got into the sled. 
And we told him to avoid the ma in roads, to
 go you know through the villages and so on but 

avoid the, the main roads because on the main ro
ads there were German transports going and so 
on.   

 We didn™t want to have  any encounter with them.  So as we came to one village and it 

was of course snow covered, the te
rrain and it was rather
 dark night.  But stil
l the refl ection fr om 
the snow you know  it was ma king it. Anyway we cam
e to the mi ddle of the village. As we were 
in the mi ddle of the village, we looked  to the si
des and there were tanks 
parked in the, in the 
yards of the, of the peasant huts. And it was an 
SS unit and we didn™t of course. I had to ma ke 

Interview with Leo
n a rd Za wa cki  9 
 
the decision and I said well since we are more th
an half way through the village we just carry on. 
And we did carry on. 

 Then the village road left to the ma in road
 which we had to take.  As we came to the 
ma in road a truck, a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped 

and a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently 
he had the intention of 
arresting us and that 
we are trying to interfere with his wa r. And but 
when he saw us four there in the sled, it was the 
driver, there were five, he didn™t™
 utter a word. He, he realized th
at we were probably he realized 
that we were partisans.  

 Because on the  ma in roads the Germans ha
d big boards, billboards.  The written and 
warning that the German troops of bandits, they 
called us bandits.    Bandits you know  so I™m 
sure he realized that we were one but he di
dn™t say. Anyway had he uttered some thing you know 
we would have to shoot him because, but so we we
nt, we came  to the main road.  The ma in road 
was at that  time fr ee and then we went a little b
it further to the foothills and we dismissed the, 
the driver.  And we thanked him very much and we
 then walked there and we went back into the 

mountains.  We had some 
safe houses in the mountains . it was 
there were foresters who were at 
the, we stayed with them.  Matter of fact this particular  time it was actually the Christ mas Eve 

 And then we went to the, to the forest a
nd there we had we came  a fter mi dnight and we  
had our Christma s Eve celebration.  Very short one.  

 

Q:  What was that like? 

 

A:  Oh we, we just went to the house, we
 woke up the whole household. That was only the 
forester, his wife and two daught
ers. And we just went there 
and we sung carols and then we 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  10 
 
went to sleep cause we were tired. It was alread
y past mi dnight  we went to sleep into, in the 
barn. We  didn™t™ sleep in the house.  And then
 the next morning we stayed again through the 
whole day in the barn until evening. Then we went back to  our camp.   
 Well we went to our camp and you know join
ed our other comr ades.  And at one time 
you know the, the Russian, it was then the you,  no
 it wasn™t Christma s Eve. Then we stayed 
there until the fi rst of January.  We spent celebrat
ed as much a s  we could celebrate, New Year™s 

eve in the mountains. And the Russians were
 already nearing the camp at Auschwitz. 
 

Q:  What was that time  like, Did you, was 
there an actual time  when you knew you were 
being liberated.  Or 

 

A:  Well we, we knew you know the front move me nt s. Matter of fact, you know for instance, 

one instance we were in the mountains.  Again in
 the night.  a whole company of ma ybe a few, 
ma ybe a battalion of Germans was marching on the 
road in the mountains.  And we came to the 

road. We  didn™t take the ma in roads. We  alwa
ys went, and we had very good guides who knew 
the mountains you know inside and out.  You 
know they were mountain people so we didn™t 
have to them anyway. But we cam
e once to a main road and on th
is main road therefore was a 
whole battalion of Ger mans ma rching in the night.
  And they were withdrawing from the eastern 
front.   

 And we ca me right to, to the edge of 
you know on the, of the road and we walked 
alongside the Germans. They didn™
t bother us and we didn™t bother.
  They spoke to us and we 
spoke to them.   And then when there was a 
gap between the battalions
 we  crossed the road 
because we had to go.  Of course we wouldn™ t take on a whole you know battalion of Ger man 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  11 
 
solders because we didn™t have any chance.  A
nd they didn™t want a
ny bother either.  So you 
know it mut ually understandable that they knew th
at there we re partisans and knew that they 
were, but we didn™t interfere 
with their actions and they 
didn™t interfer
e with us.  
 And in, in January of 45 when, when I don™t™ know the exact date but probably in 
the middle, in the middle of January because 
Auschwit z was liber ated a, I think at the 
end of January on the I think 28
th
 of January.  But it was evacuated on the 18
th
 January. 
The able bodied prisoners in Auschwitz were evacuated to deep into the German Reich 

and they were marched.  So in the, in 
the middle of January when we knew that the 
front and the Russians  are coming close, we 
an order came from the main headquarters 
of the partisan unit.  Actually the partisan un
its were called the home army.  In, and it 
was a very well organized organization and wa
s well I mean Poland wide you know not 
only in the mountains where we were but th
ere were also in the east of Poland you 
know.   
 And  what awe heard when they came and they di sclose d themselves to the Russians 
ma ny of them or most of them we
re arrested and taken to Si beria.  And since we knew about it, 
we said we are not going to the headquarters knew
 about it, they disbanded. They gave us orders 
to be that  we will be di sbanding and go as civilians 
and they issued us fa lse papers as ci vilians.  

In the neighborhood.   

 So we went after the Russians moved there 
we went as civilians and we went back to 
Auschwitz.  In Auschwitz I had other friends of
 mi ne who ca me escaped from Auschwitz.  We 
regist ered ourselves in Auschwitz as former prisoners of Auschwitz.  And we got legitimate 

papers from there. Of course 
the transport was very, very poo
r and we couldn™t™ move very 
easily but eventually we were able to
, to get to Krakow from Auschwitz.  

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  12 
 
 And in Krakow we had some  friends, especia
lly one fr iend who was still alive.  He was 
also a former inma te in Auschwitz and we stay
ed with him. And later on when the moveme nt, 
you know at that time there was, the whole fr
ont was moving west. A
nd we encountered ma ny, 
ma ny Russians and especially the Russians who near
, when we stayed near Auschwitz they were 
always asking us how far is it to the for mer 
Polish German border.  And we said it was 
approximately it was ten kilometers and we said 
we were curious.  Why did they ask. I said why 
do you ask. He said because once we cross this bo
rder then we can do whatever we like.   
 

Q:  Was it a time of chaos?  

 

A:  Yes, there wa s a chaos yes.  First of a
ll the railroads were disrupted. You know the lines 
were disrupted. You know there were bombings
 and, and you couldn™t™ go, you only could go so 
far and then the, the line was 
the railroad line was dama ged and you had to walk for a few 
kilome ters and then take another train from ther
e on. and so on.  So there was a lot of disruption, 
especially going from south to north. The lines y
ou know going from east to west they were kept 
because that™s where you know the move me nt was 
and all the delivery of the arms and so on had 
to go this wa y so they we re repaired right away.   

 But the other lines you know
 meaning from north, from south to north, they were 
disrupted yeah.  They were not, so it, it was very
 difficult to move around.  
It wasn™t easy at all. 
 

Q:  You™re talking about phone lines? 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  13 
 
A:  Oh not only phone but rail lines you know and ro
ads.  And roads.  Especially rail.  For 
instance I after I stayed in Krakow for some tim
e I think in end of Fe
bruary, I think we, my 
friend who also lived in, in northern part of Poland, not far from
 home  town, we wanted to go 
and we went. And for instance we had to travel mo
stly on top of the roof 
of the, of the trains. 
Then we only could get, we c
ouldn™t go through Warsaw.  We had to take some  line. Then and 
we had to walk, to walk ma ny ti me s you know 
for, for ma ny hundred, not hundred but tens of 
kilome ters.   And finally we did get to, to n
earby west of Wa rsaw and there we got a train, a 
Russian transport train which was  delivering petrol or what you say, gasoline.  You know to the 
front cause the war was still on.  

 So we got on this tank, tanker and I, I had an
 accident. I put my foot in order you know to 

sit under the big tank you know and just on some  
 railing you know.  I tried to prop myself up 
and I put my foot in a coupling you know where 
the trains when they, the coupling.  There was 
an opening. I put my, my heel into it. I wore, 
I had a German jackboot you know  which I took 
from a German.  And it had a very strong heel. A
nyway I put it in there. And while the train was 
pulling you know there was a gap a
nd I didn™t™ realize that afte
r it started braking it stand you 
know and the opening closed and it caught my he el. 
 And ma t t er of fact, I 
thought that I lost my 
you know my, my heel. That it was crushed.  Becau
se right away you see the, the boot.  Broke, 
the leather broke. 

 And I felt tremendous heat you know in the 
whole foot.  But I couldn™t™ pull out, I 
couldn™t™ do anything until the train st arted to pull
 again and then I was able to feel my foot.  
And,  but and I asked my friend because my friend 
was sitting next to me , to hold me  in case I 
lost consciousness. You know so that I wouldn™
t™ fall under the wheels. 
 And, and then finally 
the, the train came to a stop at a st ation and we got
 off and I went to a first aid station but they 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  14 
 
didn™t™ have much there.  in th
e first aid station. They couldn™t™ 
do it. all they did, they split the 
jack boot and I took it off and there was, th
ere wa s no, it was only internal bleeding and the 
whole foot was black and blue.   
 And they, they couldn™t x ray because  they
 didn™t have any x ray machines. And we 
couldn™t also we had to walk for an hour I think,
 some  30 or 40 kilome ters to the next, and I was 
hobbling on this foot and eventually there was a ca
rt, a peasant™s cart and 
I, they put me  on the 
peasant™s cart and that, til we came to his home 
town which was is appr oxima tely 40 miles away 
from my home town. And I stayed there for the 
next two weeks I think, 
three weeks. And then 
later on, I, I took from there and 
I took a train to, to my home  town which I thought I would be 

able to get. But it only went 
one station and they stopped. 
 The Russians stopped the train and they put it 
on the side, side rank.  And then they took 
all the people in the train to do, do some  work 
for  the you know for the Russians. I, I refused. I 
said I can™t work because  I, I was lame . I just 
couldn™t do it. So I had an argument with a Russian 
sergeant, but anyway he walked away.  And, a
nd then he said well you work for one day and 
then the next day you will go carry on.  We ll the next day came . The train was still on the sides. 

You know the people we re still working. The ne
xt, there was only one train a day comi ng. 
 But I knew about it. you know I knew how the Russians behaved so I went back and 

when the train came I got on this train and I went, 
but again it only went fe
w, a few stations and 
then I had to get off and walk. And by that time 
I could walk much better.  And then I while I 
walked, a Russian truck came and I stopped and the
y, they gave me  a lift. And then finally I 
came to the place which was quite close to my hometown.  

 But it was on the left bank of the Vistula rive
r and I had to walk, I walked to the Vistula 
but the bridges on my, there were two bridges 
leading across the Vistula and they were both

blown up. So and the river was full of ice. It was 
still I think March.  Full of ice. So I couldn™t 
get through and it was, the level 
of the water was very high. There were docks you know. It was 
close to the you know you thought that any, any 
mome nt it will overflow. You know and flood 
all the low lying lands. But after a few days you 
know it, water receded a
nd the ice receded and 
then the Russian start to build
 a pontoon bridge.  So once th
ey started building the pontoon 
bridge, I, I stayed in a, a far m house which 
was  a German fa rm house which was abandoned by 
the Germans. 
 And there were, but there we
re still you know the livestock 
was there and we went into 
this house. There was nobody but we went in the 
room and there was heat so we wondered what, 
what happening.   Couldn™t see. After a while 
a ma n ca me  a nd he was a groom who was a Polish 
fellow, a groo m to the livestock who were German
 far mer. And we said well then we can stay. 
He said oh yes you can stay here.  He said do you 
need any food. I said of course we need food. 
So he brought us food and milk.  And so we st
ayed there for a few days until the water had 
receded.   

 Once the water receded we went to the, to
 the place where the Russians were building the 
pontoon bridge.  As we came there, the Russianist ar
rested us and took us, they said, not arrested 
but they wanted us to work so they loaded us
 on a truck and they were driving some where and 
said where are you driving. Finally you know becau
se the truck stopped and the officer got out 
and he looked at the ma p and he didn™t know where he was.  

 And then we asked him what do you want. He 
said I want the forest. I said why. Because 
we need some  wood to cut wood.  I said why didn™t you ask us.  We  would, you™re going out of 

your way.  Going the wrong direction.  You s
hould have asked us, you know. We  would have 
told you where to how to take.  So we had to go 
back and then we came to the forest. And there 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  16 
 
they got off you know and looked which tree to cu t. In the meantime we all dispersed you know.  
And we, I  went back, I went back to the pla
ce where they were buildin
g the, the pontoon. I got 
my belongings because I had to leave it there.  
Took my belongings, went 
there and then officer, 
captain Russian captain came  on a motor boat and I 
spoke to him whether he will take me  across.  
And he said do you have vodka. I said no I don™t ha
ve any vodka but I had a fountain pen and a 
pencil and a Parker fountain pen a
nd a pencil in a red case and I sa
id I give you this. He said ok.  
And then I said I had a friend and I said I have my
 brother. Of course he wa s not my brother.  
But I said I wanted him,  take my brother as
 well. He said no, either you or nobody. It™s only you 
I take.  I won™t take your brother.  So I said ok. He
 said I have to go back to the other side of the 
river and then I come  back and I take him.  

 And in the meanti me another officer came to
 the water edge and I started talking with 
him and apparently he wa s from I don™t know whether he was from NKVD, you know the KGB 

or some thing. Anyway, he was fr
om an intelligence unit and he 
had to report some where on the 
other side in a village where there we re the h
eadquarters.  To the hea
dquarters of the Russian 
army.   And he asked me  whether I knew how to 
get there. I said yes, I know. And we started 
talking and I said you go with me  and I show you 
exactly where to go, which road to take. So 
when the, when the boat came you know with th
e captain, he took, took us you know the Russian 
officer, he was I think a leftenant 
and myself and he drove us.   
 But he was very leery. He didn™t talk to me .  
The captain didn™t talk to me   because he 

was afraid. And I didn™t know how 
he recognized but apparently 
he recognized that he was you 
know some body very important.   Not to me ss. So
 anyway, I said well I won™t give him now the 

pen.  I said if I give him,  I give hi m one piece,
 I gi ve him the pencil.  You know. So when we 

went out, he was standing like this with his 
hands you know behind him and as I walked out, I 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  17 
 
pressed you know the pencil into his hand and he
 didn™t say anything.  You know because he 
was afraid of the, so we went and we walked.  
 My home town was it was a fortress. And th
e Germans were defending it until I think the 
end of March. So when we came just they just capitulated a day or so before. So the ma ny parts 

of the town were still burni
ng you know.  And there was a terr
ible destruction. Anyway we 
walked. I told him which way to, to take to th
e destination which he wanted to go and I went 
home.  

 And I came to my parents. My parents were
 in the house but our house had I think 36 or 
some thing you know holes in it you know from, from
 the, from the artillery pieces you know 
which were ma de you know the Germans were defending.  Our house was more or less on the 

outskirts of the, of the town.   

 

Q:  So it was bombed or shot at 
 
A:    No shot at by, by artillery you know.  
What do you call it, whatever. Anyway it was full 
of holes.  And they, my father ma de a, in the 
cellar he ma de a bunker mor e  or less you know to 
protect the, we are sitting a
ll the time in the cellar.   
 

Q:  What was the reunion like? 

 

A:  Well you know when I escaped I did write a lett
er but I didn™t write a 
letter to my home .  

You know when I escaped from because I, I di
dn™t you know they probably, I di dn™t™ want to 
endanger them. So I did write a letter
 to a neighbor and in this lett
er I also enclosed a letter for 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  18 
 
my parents.  For, and I asked the neighbor to deli
ver it to my parents, which he did.  So they 
knew that I escaped.  But of course they didn™
t know since you know wh
at happened to me . The 
war was still going on.  When I came to the house my
 father didn™t™ recognize me .  Not at first 
you know.  My mother right away did. And so as I say I stayed a few days oh and during this 
time I came, it was already quite dark when I came
. When I left the Russian officer, came , it was 
getting very dark.  And apparently the house wa
s under observation because 
they next morning I 
was sleeping you know in my room and the Russians 
burst in with an automa tic rifle, you know.   
 In my and pointed it to me  in the bed. He 
thought that I was a German.   He said and I 
told him, I showed him r i ght, I said look I am he
re from Ausc hwitz and I came. Then he realized 

that he ma de a mi stake and he left.   

 But there were ma ny instances.  You never, 
suppose he didn™t™ know what it was.  You 
know he would have taken me  and you know.  Well pe
ople don™t™ realize what 
war really is here.  
You  know. Cause you have to experience it 
yourself you know before you can understand you 
know what it was and how it was.   What we went through. 

 

Q:  And even after liberation there wa
s so much har dship, wasn™t there? 
 

A: Yes, yes. I didn™t™ want to stay in my 
home  town. There was not
hing. There was a lot of 

destruction.  And  

 

Q:  Can you describe some  of it? 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  19 
 
A: Well some , some  streets were completely
 destroyed. You know they were blown up or 
yeah. The and then the Germans also tried to prevent it. They were flooding you know there 

were some  lowlands which they tried to flood 
and they flooded it which of course they didn™t 
prevent it, the Russians from comi ng anyway. 

 The Russians were very callous about their 
dead, very callous. They were, there were 
ma ny bodies of Russians lying for, for days. Th
ey were not, until the Polish population started 

buried them because they were af
raid of, of you know epidemic and but they, they just couldn™t 
care less.  Not only of course they didn™t™ care
 about the German bodies, but, but of their own 
they didn™t care.   

 Well when later on I went to Krakow and for 
instance in Krakow they well in the hospital 
when they operated you know they had to amput
ate the limbs and so on. they were throwing 

them out of the window in the street and absolu
tely I don™t know. They were a different kind of 
people.   
 
Q:  What was the very day life for people. A
nd you said you don™t™ want to stay in your town 
for very long. But just what was ever
yday life getting food, you know the poverty.  
 

A: Well that was very scarcity of food. You 
can ima gine ma ny things were destroyed. Many 
tings since my home  town was occupied, not 
only occupied but incorporated. The Germans 
removed everything what they could.  So it, it
 was very, very difficu
lt.  Everything was you 
know Russian. You couldn™t™ buy. You had to have
 coupons you know in order to buy.  Bread. I 
know my father had to go and he did go to the 
country you know to the pe
asants to get food. And 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  20 
 
only from peasants he  knew because otherwise th
ey wouldn™t sell either. So it, it was very 
difficult. It was difficult for everybody, for everybody.   

 And I myself went back to Krakow to see 
my friends and then we started we had to do 
some thing. You know the schools were still cl
osed. You know during the occupation of 
Germany of course all the high sc
hools and the universities were
 closed. We couldn™t™ study at 
all. And later on, I, I went to Krakow and we
, we got together some  of my friends you know 
Auschwitz friends. And we didn™t know what to do 
and eventually we had an idea. We  wanted to 
open a, a café and a restaurant. And we were able
 to do it cause we got organized and we got a 

place.  And the place was a villa which was given, not
 given to us but lent  to us by the widow of 
a university professor who was killed in Auschw
itz and she said yes you can have this you know 

and use it.  

 And of course we would pay rent for it. 

 
Q:  And was that a difficult thing to do gi
ven that there was a lot of poverty to Œ 
 
A:  Well we some how wer e  able to I woul
d say that ma ybe we had some  privileges you 
know, a little privilege because we were you know from Auschwitz and everybody knew what 

we went through.  So also the Russians, they di
dn™t and they couldn™t car
e less. But anyway we, 
we did get organized and we opened this restaura
nt and we had a, a band playing and we opened 
on a Sunday and we advertised you know as mu ch
 as we could, although everything was hush, 
hush you know.  there was a Polish security  and 
the Russian security and so on.  Anyway we 
opened this and it was a great success because we
, we name d the place you know that, the place 
would be at Auschwitz, form
er Ausc hwitz prisoners. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  21 
 
 And there was a great, tremendous a mount of 
people came. It was so well that we had 
also a garden and there was no space. Peopl
e were standing outside
 you know.  And ma ybe 
because of the success, the next morning on Monda
y the Russians came  and they closed it. they 
took everything you know, even the, the band. Th
ey left their instrume nts you know. They 
wouldn™t let the instrume nts, nothing and we were
, they left with them. So we went and we 
couldn™t do anything, nothing. So we 
went to the Polish authorities. And they said well we can™t 
do anything.  They couldn™t do anything so I said
 well are you going to comp
ensate us.  After all 
we did put some  money into it. 
whatever our labor. Our labor and the lady, I mean the, the 
widow you know of this.     
 They said we can™t do anything. Anyway afterwards they did compensate us and they 

give us a night, night club in 
the center of, of Krakow which we took over and we used.  And we 
ran it for some , but I, I was very discouraged wi
th everything which was 
going on at that time in 
Poland.  It wa sn™t the Poland which we expected. 
  You know.  For instance
 when the end of the 
war came you know the celebration. We didn™t™ cele
brate at all.   Nobody. We were all very 
much depressed.  You know a
bout the whole situation.  
 And it was a very sad time. And I left Poland s
oon after it. I left, I left the business.  I, I 
knew that nothing would come  of it. and I left 
Poland with another friend of mi ne on in August 
of 1945.  And I went ma ybe there was also part of
 it, ma ybe a dventurous and I wanted to see the 
other world as what it was.  and I went w
ith him, we went through Czechoslovakia  and 
Germany to Italy.   

 We, we got legitima te papers.  We ll legitima te
  we, there were, we bribed an official and 
he gave us the papers.  Which I don™t™ knowhow good they would be and because we didn™t™ 

even test them.  When we came to the border we
 didn™t™ go in just, we
 went through the border 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  22 
 
and bypassed the you know the place where the 
checked every, the checkpoints you know and 
got to the Czech, got to
 Czechoslovakia.   
 But we also have Czechoslovakian vi sas wh
ich when we got into the train on the Czech 
side you know   the Czechs came and they check
ed it and apparently they were good because 
they didn™t say so we went to Prague  and at th
at time  of cours e  the war was finished and there 
was a demarcation line between the American for
ces and the Russian forces, between Prague and 
Pilsner you know. and Czechoslova ki a.  And there 
was a border and there of course they, the 
Russians wouldn™t let anybody out but 
the trains were so packed.  
To the brim.  The roofs were 
full, everything was full you know.   
 And the Russians when it came to the checkpoint you know everybody took a piece of 

paper and wa s waving because if the guards couldn™t come  through the, you know it was too 

crowded so they had everybody went you know.  You ca me  to Pilsen and then we went the 

American occupation zone. And from th
ere we went by train to Germany.   
 Again it was not easy.  Again on the Czech 
German border there was again  checking.  
But some how we did, we went we got on a train 
which was evacuating Italian prisoner of war 

prisoners from Russia and it was going to Italy 
. So once we came to the border, we went 
together with the prisoners a
nd they didn™t™ do anything.  And we came t o, came to Munich. And 
from Munich we went to the Polish prisoner of
 war camp.  Near Muran
o.  And from there the 
friend of mi ne had some body an offi cer who was in the second Polish corps in Italy.    
 Which the second Polish corps in Italy was fighting you know during the war with  
the 8
th
 British army and the headquarters were in 
San Giorgio, Port of San Giorgio in 
Italy. And we got a passage  from Murano to
 Italy and we went to Italy.  Through the 
Brenner pass and then to Verona and Predappio. 
 Predappio the birthplace of Mussolini 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  23 
 
and we stayed there.  And then we came to
 Porto San Giorgio. And they,  they 
accepted us you know into the army and the Second po lish corps.  
 I was by then  an officer, you know second leftenant and I got assignment in Porto San 
Giorgio to the intelligence unit 
and I stayed in Italy til 1946. In
 46 the corps  was evacuated  
from Italy to Great Britain.  And I came to Great Britain.

Q:  This is tape 2 with Leonard Zawacki.  I™m
 Dee Roberts and I wanted
 to know what was a 
lot of times people have expressed that liberati
on was a sort of an almost anticlimactic because 
the war the feelings and the survival was so 
heightened and you know wa s so the day to day 
survival was so intense that afterwards there 
 was a sense of not knowi
ng what to do with your 
life.  Did you feel
 that at all. 

 

A: No, I, I don™t think I did feel this 
way. But now reflecting you know and, and going 
reflecting on these times, I know 
that I really wasn™t myself. 
You know I probably would have 
done, had I been had it been now, you know I probabl
y would have acted differently. But when I, 
I came to Italy to me  it was the best time of my life. You know it was a relaxation. Not only 

because of the climate and the, the ge ography.   
 But I just felt very free and in the army I 
was free. I more or less coul d do whatever I 
wanted.  And that, that was 
a great relaxation for me .  
 
Q:  How long were you there? 

 

A:  I was a year and as I me ntioned be
fore it was the best year of my life. 
 

Q:  What did you do during this time? 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  25 
 
A:  Well I was assigned to the intelligence unit a
nd I was in security sec
tion and I had a lot of 
free time and I had my own car and I could move  and I did visit.  Actually we the war was over 
and there were really there wasn™t mu ch to do. Of
 course, at that time , not only the Polish forces 
but the Ame r icans and so on, they thought that 
there would be anothe
r war between the two 
allies you know. Between the Soviet Union and Am
erica and England because the things started 
already to deteriorate.   And eventually you kno
w as we know now there was the Cold war. But 
it never did come to that   
 So after, after a year in Italy we were
 all ev acuated from It
aly to Great Britain 
since we were part of the 8
th
 British Army. And the, I must adm
it that I didn™t 
like it all, 
coming from sunny Italy to England.  Matter of
 fact we came to, we came to Scotland 
and it was pouring rain and it was cold and dark and then we came to a camp. We 
came first to Knowsley  Park in, near Liverpool near Prescott, Liverpool stayed there for 

a  few days and then we went to another camp in
 Poulton, in Ches hire.  And from there 
to Delmar camp, also in Cheshire,  near Ches
ter.  And then eventually, I was demobbed  
and I went to London.   
 And I finished my studies going to the L
ondon School of Foreign Trade and eventually 
started working. And then I me t my wife in 
London. I worked in London for a very short period 
of time.  
 

Q:  Why don™t you say your wife™s name  or he
r maiden name and tell me how you met. 
 

A:  Oh I me t her, I had, I quartered in a fam
ily in an English family. I had a room with a 
friend of mi ne and it was in the no
rthern part of London, in let me  think of it.  Forgot the name .  

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  26 
 
Can I.  Yes, it was Hiberry New Park and if the 
parents the people who I lived were also friends 
of Frida™s.  I (microphone bump)   and she cam
e there one day and (microphone problem).  I me t 
my future wife at Mr. and Mrs. 
Gardner and then eventually I didregister.  My friend registered 
with the American consulate you know to go to Am
erica.  He had a aunt here. I didn™t have 
anybody in America.  

 And he a, urged me  also to register and I di
d. And before I knew the consulate sent me  all 
the papers and then I went for an interview and 
before I knew I was in the states.  Because there 
was an act of Congress that was passed that 18,0
00 ex-Polish service men will be admitted and I 
came here.  As a matter of fact, I fl ew, Britis
h. (speaking to someone in another room) 

 Yeah I came on an El Al Airline from London.  
Heathrow to Idyllwild at that time  it was. 
JFK Kennedy was called Idyllwild.   And I was 
sponsored by actually by a priest. It was 
arranged by my friend.  A priest 
in Milwaukee. And I had some  friends who lived also in New 
Jersey and I stayed with them for 3 
weeks before I went to Milwaukee. 
 

Q:  Let™s back up a little bit. Did you f
eel a need to get ma rried right away.   
 

A:  No I didn™t, no, no. 

 

Q:  And to start a fa mily. 

 

A:  No, no.  Ne ver, didn™t ha ve that need at al
l. I di dn™t but not until I came to the states. The 
states and I felt a little
 lonely.  Another strange you know ve
ry strange country for me , America. 

Interview with Leon a

Q:  What year was this. 

 

A:  It was in 1951.   

 

Q:  What was the diffi culty in adjusting?  

 

A:  Well first of all I was very poor. I didn™t,
 I came  here having $56 in my pocket.  And I 
think half of it was, which I bo
rrowed from my future wife.  
I we were not ma rried. We got 
ma rried in a year.  So and then I st arted work i
n, in Milwaukee and I went to the factory. I had a 

job which I could have in an office. But they
 wanted to pay me  $55 a week and my friend 
thought it was not enough.  

 And he said you could make much more in goi
ng to a factory. So I we
nt to a factory but I 
just couldn™t do it there. I was work, I was earni
ng much more, almost 
a hundred dollars but the 
work was, I was ma king coat hangers, you kwon fo
r the laundry and dry cl
eaning establishments 
and I just couldn™t put up with it and it was, I 
worked overtime and I got 
up at 5:00. And finally I 
said, no. And I, I quit the job and I came  to New York. 

 And then in New York I got myself a  j
ob with Chase Manhattan bank.  You know the 
bank. I worked for, it was rather a me nial job. It 
was for the, in a foreign department and didn™t™ 
pay much. $40, I think forty some thing dollars a w
eek.  I was getting. And then I after a year, I 

asked them for a promotion because I thought I 
wa s better educated to do the job I was doing 

there. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  28 
 
 And the supervisor, they were 
all Irish me n and they were I 
think all keeping together and 
he wrote a letter, a me mo to his superior and he 
said that in his opinion he thinks that he can do 
better job. And of course I, nothing came  of itand I left. And I left. I went to a insurance 
company, Cosmopolitan Mutual Insurance Comp any 
and I stayed there for ten years.  And I 
think I did progress there. And then I left th
em a gain. And I went to another company.  New 
York fire and ma rine underwrite
rs.  And there, there I became
 the chief accountant. And then 
from there I think I was 8 years there.  

 The company me rged and they wanted to go to
 Milwaukee and be part
 of Milwaukee so I 
left and I went with AIG, American Intern
ational Group, a group of
 compa nies which was 
worldwide company.  And I stayed there for th
e next seven years. And from there I got 
transferred.  I asked for the tran
sfer.  Frieda wanted to go back
 to England so they have big 
offices in London.  SO I got a transfer and went to London and 

 
Q:  I™m going to back track a little bit here.  Y
ou said that this is a 
strange country. What was 
strange. 
 

A: Well it was strange insofar that it wasn™t 
European.  You know. I, I mean I was brought 
up in Europe and England and Italy. And it was 
a little, a little rough. You know some of the 
people.  I also there were mo
stly you know they were very how do you say.  Very understanding 
but, but they in ma ny instances they were ra
ther how do you say not to offend anybody. But they 
were gruff you know and loud and, and pushy you know a
nd I wasn™t used to that. And of course 

also  I in the east I really di
dn™t like the climate. The climate 
was to me , e specially later on you 
know when I worked in New York, the subways, the humidity in the summe r, I just can™t, I 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  29 
 
couldn™t stand it. You know you took a shower in 
the morning, went in the subway and you were 
already perspiring you know and you were wet.  
 At that time the subways were not of c
ourse were not air conditioned. And, and the 
pushing and shoving and you know almo
st every day there were fi
ghts on the, on the subways. 
You know you™re not exposed when you live in Po
rtland or some where else but in New York. 
And New Yorkers were generally very, very rou
gh and tough and, and even the police were not 
very kind.  You know.  
 I remember one instance where I came I 
was new in New York, and I asked. I 
had a friend who lived on park Avenue.  I think I was on 5
th
 Avenue and I asked the 
polic eman ad the corner.  I said could you 
please direct me.  And I was very polite 
where Par Avenue is and he didn™t™ utter a 
word. He just motioned with his hand. 
 And in other instance they were not ver
y, very pleasant. But you know I overcame, 
overcome this. you know I™m not us ed to it. 
 
Q:  You also me ntioned loneliness 

 

A:  Well loneline ss because  I did, although I had 
 family but I already helped ma ny friends in 
England, ma ny friends and I knew a fa mily in Ne
w York but it wasn™t the same .  They were 
elderly and they had a daughter. Maybe they want
ed me  to ma rry the daughter but, but I you 
know besides that I didn™t™ have 
anybody. And this, this you know th
is was a one of the reasons I 
was lonely. And eventually I did ask my future wi
fe to and she came, ca me over in 52.  In April 
we got ma rried. Then we established our own hous
ehold.  First we had a furnished apartment in 
Brooklyn            

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  30 
 
 And we stayed there for a year and then we
 got our own apartment in Jackson Heights in 
Queens and we got our own furniture  and then you know first we had only one bedroom. 
Afterwards we had two bedroom apartment. And 
then we moved from there to, to Flushing. You 
know New York as any big city I think is ch
anging very rapidly.  You know the neighborhoods 

change, especially in New York.  Jackson Heights 
after a while I think we 
lived there ten years. 
You know it started changing. Many transients, mostly
 from South America and then it became  a 
part of, there were ma ny drugs you know deal
ers around, South America, Colombia and so on.  
So we move d out.  

 And then we moved as I said in 76 we  m
oved to England. I got a transfer. But again I 
didn™t like then England. I was already used to
 America you know.  and I was Americanized and 
I didn™t like England. Matter of fact Frieda didn™t like because England started changing. It was 

not the same  thing as when we, so I stayed ther
e only 15 months.  And then I asked for a transfer 
back but the company sa id no. We  just transfer
red you. no you can™t  so I 
said all right well I 
quit.  And  

 

Q:  Was it difficult to find a f
eel that there™s a home for you. 
 

A: No, I think my home  is now here. Now I, I 

 

Q:  Before that 

 

A: Before, yes, yes it was.  Yes.   

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  31 
 
Q: Were you looking for a home? 
 

A: Oh yes, yes. I you know I, I you know I.  After a while in New York, we did ma ke some  

friends. I had some  friends, although not very 
close you know. They were not Polish really. One 
was an Austrian friend and the other one was a C
zech.  So I didn™t have too ma ny Polish friends.   
 

Q:  Did you ever think about going back to Poland? 

 

A: No. I never did, never. 

  

Q:  Why?  

 

A:  I don™t know why, why, probably one of the reasons was the economic situation.  And the 
political situation. I just didn™
t want to live under the Communist
 you know regime s. I because I 
went there ma ny ti me s. I the first time I went
 to Poland you know after I became an American 
citizen, which was in 1956. And I went to Pola
nd in 58 and I saw you know what was going on. I 
couldn™t, I couldn™t live there. It 
was, first of all the people we re 
not free.  You know and they, it 
was a police state.  You know I had to go to the po
lice when I arrived there,
 to register. It™s a 
police state. and they took a you know they inte
rrogated me  and I had to sign you know the, the 
it was like confession. What I was doing  and what
 and why.  And I had to sign it you know.  My 
god. 
 And no I couldn™t, I couldn™t™ live there. 
I wouldn™t.  And now, now that it is a free 
country you know I just don™t™ th
ink about it. I have been li
ving here too long. and you know I 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  32 
 
wouldn™t, wouldn™t live there, coul
dn™t.  Look I spent most of my 
adult life, most abroad.  And 
you know.  
 

Q:  You were talking about all 
the different jobs that you™ve 
been employed in.  Did you ever 
talk to people about your war 
experiences during that time. 
 

A: Yes, I did I™m sure. I did speak about. I, I 
myself think that I was quite successful later on 
in life, you know after I 
quit the job in London. I did get a job ri
ght away in America.  And back 
in America with by that  time I sp
ecialized in reinsurance business 
and I got a job with a company 
which was part of CIT financial corporation a
nd they bought me  back and they paid for my 
passage and the furniture because when I went to 
England we went with all our furnitur e.  We ll 
not all but some  of the furniture. Bu the first company which transferred me  paid for it.  

 And then this company which hired me  bac
k. At that time I was already 62 years old. 
You know s o at 62 not anybody, everybody can find anot
her job but I was able to because I think 

my services were you know such that , that they
 needed me  and I became a vice president and 
later on I did and I was also dire
ctor, you know the board of directors. And then after board of 
directors. Then later on I became a consultant  
and I worked on my own account. And I well and I 

you know for an immi grant I think I, 
I did quite well. So for this I mean I am very grateful and I 
am as I said, although the beginnings were very ha
rd I think I did ma ke some thing of i t . And I 
didn™t, didn™t think too 
much about my past. 
 Although as I said, when I reflect on it, I at tim
es I wasn™t quite myself aft e r I left the you 
know after I escaped from because it did l
eave some thing on my mi nd you know. for years, 

which I spent in the concentration camp. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  33 
 
 
Q:  You say you weren™t quite yourself. 

 

A:  Well you know when I, when I think back you know that ma ybe I would have done 

things differently you know in some  ways and I,
 I just know that I wasn™t quite you know. I you 
know I never tried because for instance I never tried to
 talk about it. I didn™t 
want to talk about it. 
I didn™t want to recall it.  So I kept it you 
know buttoned up. And I did you know then try for  
compensation and but it was a very (mini mal? )  
compensation which I did get. And I didn™t ever 
follow this through.   

 I probably because as a people in same  ci
rcumstances as I you know didn™t get much 
more money out of the German government but I just
 really didn™t™, didn™t wa
nt.  All I did get, I 
got 1800 dollars I don™t know what y
ear it was out of just a la
wyer took 400. And I think I got 
1400 which you know it™s nothing.   
 But you know I probably could claim on some  phys
ical disability or  mental disabi lity or  
some thing of the kind. I didn™t. I was lucky and grat
eful that I came  out a
live and I don™t™ think 
that I have any physical disa
bility or me ntal disabilit
y. Although ma ybe you know that 
some thing was playingon my mi nd anyway becaus
e it had to leave some , some thing you know.  
The things which I saw and experienced. 
 

Q:  I read that you ha
d recurring nightmares 
 

A: I, I did, some times I do yes, I do.  I have well ma ybe it™s also due because I still read 

about this and this you know 
when I read and I, you know. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  34 
 
 
Q:  Do you read about the wa r experience. 

 

A;  Yeah the war. It™s very hard to explain.You know how people could be that way if what 

kind of people they were that 
they could do such you know terrible things, I mean gruesome  
things. So that, that I do have nightma
res but not as much as I used to. 

 

Q:  Do you remember when they first started? 

 

A: Oh no not really  I couldn™t tell you but I th
ink they started much later than, not right at 
the beginning because I tried to push it away a
nd I think I pushed, I was ve ry successful at 
pushing. I didn™t want to think and I di dn™t™ talk
 about it you know until I st arted talking. Then, 
then they came  back.  Yeah.  
 
Q:  What kind of dreams do you 
have, what kind of dreams. 
 

A:  Oh things are always terrible dreams.  You know some body trying to kill me  and 

some thing like that. most being killed or you know some thing to this of this nature yes.  

 

Q:  How do you think that this wa
r experience shaped your character? 
 

A:  Well I think I became more tolerant . Y
ou know I ma tured mo re.  I was you know as 
youth I you know you are always full of ener
gy and you know ma ny dislikes and not very 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  35 
 
tolerant you know to others, othe
r people think and I th
inkI™m much mor e  tolerant.Much more 
understanding.  And I, I think I 
am a  better person not that I don™t know as I was a bad person 
but I, I™m more understanding you know
 much, I am more forgiving. Th
at™s what it, what I think 
I am.   
 

Q:  You also have had incredible survival skills.  And how has that shaped you? 

 

A: Yes well I can tell you that from the firs
t mo me nt when I was arrested I thought of 
nothing else but how to get out. How to I neve
r did give up, never did. I never lost you know 
hope.  And I never, and I, I have tried, always 
tried to be very inconspicuous. I, I knew ma ny 
people in the camp you know who tried to be very heroic you know and, and 
I, I realized right 
from the beginning that the best way was to be 
do yourself, but keep qui
et you know to yourself.  
And not to try to be a hero.  
 But I never gave hope, up hope you know of 
surviving and I never gave up hope of 
escaping. It always was on my mi nd to escape. Matter 
of fact the first day wh
en they arrested me  
I already thought to escape 
while they were arresting me . I just you know didn™t know enough 
because we were, we came   to the prison. It wa
s a reception room which was close to the exit 
room.  And you had to go in order to escape you ha
d to just ha d to go out of the reception room. 
Then you had to go through two gates. You know 
where there were guards.  I thought that, I 
thought since I didn™t speak E, Ge
rman you know that I would bluff my way through the gates, 
you know because at that time there were
 still Polish guards in the prison.  
 But I, I am afraid I didn™t™ have enou
gh courage and I didn™t know enough you know how 
the whole prison system operated. But I did think 
about it. I did think because I was in civilian 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  36 
 
clothes you know when they arrested me  and I 
was well dressed and as a German I probably 
could say heil Hitler you know and the Polish guar
ds wouldn™t know the di
fference.  And ma ybe 
they would let me  through.  But I didn™t do it. But 
I did think, I never as I said, I never lost hope.  
Never lost hope. 
 

Q:  And the courage to take that chance too. 
Where does that come from?  because a lot of 
people were afraid to take the chan
ce because they mi ght be killed. 
 

A: I don™t know I really, it™s very hard to expres
s.  You either have 
it or you don™t have it. 
We, when I tried to escape from Aus c hwitz we ha
d a different plan and to escape and when the 
time ca me  we tried to escape as civilians and one 
of the fe llows just coul dn
™t it. He just couldn™t 
do it.  He was shaking like a leaf.  And he said 
I can™t do it, and we had to abandon him.  And so 
we could do it.  I did.  I, I don™t say that I was 
not afraid or you know but
, but I took the chance. 
And we had very close, very cl
ose calls during the escape.  We  
had close calls but we ma de it. 
You know but we believed in ourselves and we 
believe d in that we will be successful . So we 
were, but I took the chance and you 
know for we also knew what c
onsequences would be if we 
didn™t succeed. And we were prepared for this
. That we had the poison, you know the cyanide 
that we would take.   

 And kill ourselves because we knew that we would be killed anyway and tortur ed before 

being killed. 

 

Q:  Did you feel that a lot of people 
helped you along the way during the war.  
 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  37 
 
A: Yes, people were helpful, yes. I think 
we, we were more united you know during the war 
than we are now. And I am talking about Poland. We  were because we had a common enemy. 
You know we had a common whic
h was Germany and we were all united and we were all 
fighting you know to survive. Not that ther
e were no, no exceptions. You know there were 
exceptions. Many, some  of the Poles you know colla
borated, but there were very few. Nobody in 
Poland collaborated  who was on the top you know. 
I mean of any stature.
 Like in different 
countries. Like for instance in, in Norwa
y, Quisling you know who co
llaborated openly you 
know with the Germans. 

 In Poland we didn™t.  We were, and we we
re all united. Now it, it changed when the you 
know when the Polish governme nt, the Communis
t government came to power you know  then it 
changed. There was no unity.  And people you know there were some , those who were 

Communist you know. They were  
you know pro-Russian and the 
others were opposed to it. 
And, and the division started, 
but not during the war.  
 Now people can say you know that many I th
ink especially as I don™t know whether you 
know but Poland had I think one of
 the largest you know
 mi nority Jewish population mi nority in 
Poland, in, in the world.  There were over 3 m
illion Jews. Now ma ny Jews, the Jews accused us 
that we didn™t do much more to help the Jews.  
I think the Poles did more than any other country 
you know. They, you know to the Jews.  And they di
d it with great risk to themselves, you know 
because the Germans we re particul arly you know
 against the Jews and anybody who would help 
them.   So you know the, they just I think they
 are not fair you know in, in this assumption. 
 Not all. Many Jews are very fair. You know
 and they especially 
this book  you know for 
instance says. 
 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  38 
 
Q:  Say the name of the book. 
 

A: Oh the name  of the book is Hitler™s 
Willing Executioners you know by Daniel Jonah 
Goldhagen.  He is very fair in, in his assumpti
on. For instance I heard we
ll ma ny Jews say that 
the concentration camps were in Poland because 
of the, the Poles being not accessories but 
helping or willing you know to, to, well which 
is complete nonsense. The only thing is that 
Poland was centrally located in Europe and the bi
ggest concentration of Jews was in Poland and 
it was out of logistic you know things that the
y, that the concentration camps were there, not 
because of anybody, because the Polish population wanted to.   

 On the contrary you know they never found, 
found any Poles who would help in the 
destruction of the Jewish population. But  and 
here and this author of this book you know says 
that mostly those who helped the Germans were 
the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians.  And the, it 
is a fact because there we re Ukrainian units 
you know SS who were helping the, the Germans. 
So I think the record should be kept
 straight.  And you 
know fair is fair. 
 I don™t say that there were not people who, 
who betrayed Jews but 
then on the other hand 
it was also in some  cases where the Jews betrayed 
Poles. So we have to be
 very, very careful and 
you know and, and fair. And honest.   

 

Q:  Do you have kids 

 

A:  No we don™t™ have any children.  No.  we, I know I got ma rried. I wasn™t young.  And 

Frieda was you know she, Frieda is older than 
I and we were, came to this country.  You know 
we had to make a living and beside
 that I just di dn™t feel like ha
ving children.  I didn™t and well 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  39 
 
now when you see you know how some  of th
e youth, you know developed here you some ti me s 
wonder ma ybe it was a good thing. But  we didn™t.  

 You know that this country 
is not very how do you say, well 
I mean already this country 
everywhere now is change, the world is changi
ng very rapidly with all the communications you 
know between the different countries.  You know so the, the drug situation and so on.  Maybe  

we can describe, ma ybe it™s better
 that we didn™t have children. 
 

Q:  Do you think that young people understand the Holocaust. 

 

A: I think so.  I, I do you know I™m aske d by the college and, and the high schools and I do 

talk.  And surprisingly they do.  They know about 
it.   Of course they you know they would like 

and they want to hear firsthand you know and Idid to speak and I, they have the firsthand 

account. And of course they are, you know they are always very interested you know how I 
ma naged to escape.  And but I get very, very ni
ce letters from the youngsters you know after my, 
my talk. 
 They write to me . And it is very re
warding to you know to read it.  And 
 

Q:  Is it very di ffi cult to star t talking about? 

 

A: No it was difficult at
 the beginning.  It was 
 

Q:  When was that? 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  40 
 
A:  Well it was probably some  six years ago, 
yeah. I was much more emotional when  I 
spoke. Matter of fact I, my first talk was to a Ro
tary club. I was not a member of the  Rotary Club 
but they aske d me  to speak and, and I didn™t know 
how I will, it was a very emotional speech, so 
I was told.  I mean I didn™t listen. I talked and 
talked and I was only accorded half an hour but I 
think I spoke for an hour a
nd then nobody left there. 
 And but now I am, I don™t™ have difficu
lty. I can speak and very seldom do I get 
emotional. You know.  
 

Q:  That first speech what did 
you say, what did you talk about.  

 

A:  Oh I spoke about the whole thing you know
 about the war and how it worked. And I gave 
some  statistics you know, what you know how what
 the sufferings were and I you know I me an 
the biggest suffering of course 
were the Jews.  Took the well the crimes you know victims of the 
regime . But it has to be reme mbered you know, 
although the 6 million Jews you know perished.  
There were also 5 million of non-Jews you know 
who perished.  And they should also be 

reme mbered. And we shouldn™t you know concentrat
e only on, on the Jews and be fair you know 
to both sides.   

 I, I know that you know the other Christians you know were persecuted because of the, 

their beliefs and of their polit
ical views you know and the Jews were just you know persecuted 
because of their, their race.  Bu
t neve rtheless you know the others were also victims. So we just 
can™t you know disregard them and should be fair
 to the other victims. You know. So.  That™s 
how I feel about that.  

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  41 
 
Q:  What kind of conclusions have you come  to
 about all the reasons 
for why this happened. 
 
A: Well you know there, there is 
all, especially here in this
 country once you know from the 
Jewish community one hears you know well the 
Polish  anti-Se mitism and they comp letely 
disregard you know the German anti-Semitism.  Anti-Semitism I think is everywhere.  You 

know it is in America and this a
nd any other country. But 
the intensity of it ma y be in Poland it 
was more intense because there were more Jews.  But they completely di sr egard the intensity of 

the anti-Semitism which was in Germany.   

 And, and that™s where it all started.  And I, I forgot. 

 

Q:  Just the reasons 
why did this happen? 
 

A:  And now the reasons were first of al
l you know the, the anti, anti-Semitism you know 
existed in Ge rmany. And of course it was  how 
do you say.  It was can™t find the proper word. It 
was intensified by the regime , of the Nazi regi
me . You know their policy was the extermination 
of Jews and it was not only the, it wa s the policy of Hitler and, and, and si nce the ground you 

know the anti, anti-Semitism was there anyway, it you know when, when they came with the 

propaganda you know against the Jews it fell on 
very fertile ground. And that was the reason 
why you know the. 

 Now why there was anti-Semitism. Anti-Sem
itism was because most of the Jews were 
quite prosperous.  I, I am talking about Germ
any. In Poland you know we  had ma ny, ma ny, very 
ma ny poor J e ws.  But in Germany most of them 
were quite prosperous 
and there was hate and 
jealousy and this all contributed 
you know to, to this problem of, of
 the, the Jewish problem. And 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  42 
 
the Jewish problem was also in Poland and in Ru
ssia.  We  fi rst of all Poland was a rather poor 
country. 
 And, and you know we had a mi nority, a Je
wish mi nority of approxima tely 10, ten 
percent, close to ten percent.  
And then and we also had in prew
ar Poland we had a mi nority of 
Ukrainian mi nority of 15%.  So and I think the 
Ukrainians are even more hateful you know more 
anti-Semitic than, than the Poles were. But, but
, but you know the Poles were not to the extent . 
They always say there were Polish pogrom
s.  There were no Polish pogroms because the 
pogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of Poland.  And a 

pogrom has to be sanctioned by the governme nt. 
 And in Poland during the, the existence you 
know after the First World Wa r, the, between 
the two world wars you know which Poland was in 
existence for 20 years. It never was any, a
nything, any pogroms sanctioned by  the Polish 
governme nt.   But the pogroms were sanctioned in
 you know  as we know  in, in Germany and in 
Russia and we know what happe
ned you know to the Jews you 
know during the last wa r. 
 We know that 6 million of them were, perished. 

 

Q:  For you personally what does 
it all mean and why did it happen. 
 

A: Well I, I think it happene d you know   the 
Holocaust happened because of, of hatred 
which was you know and the hatred you know they vent
ed it, they  more or less, Hitler blamed 
the Jews and made a scapegoat of them for all th
e ills in Germany and in Europe that well and 
you know and there are ma ny reasons. 

 One reason is for instance as far as the Ca
tholic church is con
cerned you know that they 
blame the Jews for killing you know Jesus.  But you know so, so you know so the Catholics 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  43 
 
probably those less intelligent you know accept this 
you know as, as the reason to hate the Jews.  
Others take  the reason you know because they are better off, because one ha
s to accept that they 
are very industrious people.   And very educated
 most of them. And very clever.  You know and 
this you know is also cause for hating. So
 that, that there are ma ny reasons.  
 I think the reasons are also very well de
scribed in this book which I me ntioned you know 
the Hitler™s Willing Executioners.  He, he very
 well describe s you know what how, what was the 
cause you know to this holocaust.  

 And of course they  and it was popular for 
the Germans  you know for the Nazis it was a 
very popular thing to do because it united 
and anybody today nobody talks about German anti-

Se mitism.  I don™t™ know why. Of course there ar
e not ma ny Jews left in, in Germany. But there 

neither are there any ma ny Jews left in Poland an
d yet they always talk about the Polish anti-
Semitism. 

 
Q:  Some thing just I hearing your experiences
 how do you think people can be so cruel.  
How can they have all that hate. How can the cr
uelty that you witnessed  
how is that possible. 
 
A: Well that is very hard to, you know
 to understand. I don™t know you probably have 
to be born but the cruelty I m
ean it was fueled by, by the 
general policy you know of the 
regime.  I think in Germany.  And you know the hatred, the you know they had 
publications. The publicati
ons and I think it was 
Stürmer
 which was a the publication of 
the Julius Streicher who was one
 of the greatest you know 
haters of the Jews. So you 
can inflame this in a propaganda.  Goebbels 
I think he was a master of propaganda. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  44 
 
 But if you talked to people a
nd tell them this, this that the 
Jews were this and that, and 
that you know eventually it falls on, on fertile 
ground and people become , but otherwise I just 
don™t know. but ma ybe the Germans are just cruel people.  
 

Q:  I™m just thinking Œ 

 

A:  I think it, and I think it™s you know it you 
will find cruel pe ople in any na tion, in you 
know  there are sadists you know. Why do we have 
killings here like what was this fellow 
Daumer or something.  I mean it 
happens.  How do you blame this.   

 

Q:  What did you learn? 

 

A: Well as I said, I, I learned to
lerance.  You know I, I, I don™t™ think I was not tolerant but, 
but I, I have I appreciate it more you know. That 
I think everybody should have the chance to be 
what he wants to be
 and what he is.  
 

Q:  Do you think your character was tested.   

 

A:  I don™t, I don™t know.  You know I myself
 some , you know of course  I can™t judge 
myself too well, but other people. I think I 
was always a very you know  understanding person. 
You know I think I was good person.  I never got 
in any mi schief. I never, you know in, in the 
camp You know, I, I couldn™t hit and I wouldn™t h
it anybody. I mean matter of fact, I at one point 
in the camp I was, I was they made me because 
of my Ger man they made me a clerk on the, on 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  45 
 
the block. And as a clerk I had to keep th
e evidence of the pris
oners you know. How ma ny 
prisoners there were and who went to 
another block and so on and so on.   
 Well one and there were repor
ts you know the roll calls were
 twice.  And well at first 
there were 3 times a day and then afterwards they
 were twice a day. And at
 one evening roll call, 
I got a from the ma in office you know that one pris
oner had the next morning had to be delivered 
you know to the ma in office.  And apparently I was not
 supposed to tell in 
this until after the roll 
call.  But I told him befo re the roll call. Now wh
at this fellow apparently 
knew or suspected what 
is going to ha ppen, that  he probably will be executed 
so I and I told hi m this before the roll call 
so when I told him, he disappeared.   
 But we were already in the compound and 
he couldn™t escape. It was impossible to 
escape from there but, but what 
happened he, he hid hims elf in one of the blocks.  One of the 
blocks that was being built and he between the 
scaffolding you know he hid hims elf. Of course 
in this delayed the, the roll call because they
 had to find him.  And they found him very soon 
afterwards. 

 So afterwards you know the, the block  head he fired me  right away. He said you know 

you shouldn™t have told him this 
and he fired and I was punished to be sent to very heavy work 
and, and the SS told him that I, th
at he should watch me  that the 
heaviest possible work would be 
assigned to me .  So whe n we came back after 
the roll call one of the 
fellows said why don™t you 
hit him. You know because he caused you so muc h grief.  I said why should I hit hi m.  I just 

couldn™t, I why should I do this.  This poor so
ul you know probably will be dead tomorrow and 

why should do it and what would it do to me .   

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  46 
 
 So well that™s my character. I just coul dn™
t, couldn™t do that an
d I wouldn™t™ do it.  
couldn™t, couldn™t do another human being.  That
 I am, how I felt and I never did anybody any 
harm.   
 But there were people you know there were 
people. There were prisoners themselves you 
know who behaved very, very, very badly.  And th
ey were punished later on.  And, and look it, 
not only was limited you know to the German pris
oners because there were German criminal 
prisoners. There were also Polish prisoners you know
 who we re very, very cruel to other people. 

And there were Jewish prisoners who were cruel.
 They there were Jews who were also you know 

block elders you know and who behaved.  

 One has to understand that so
me  people thought that if they 
are going to be cruel or be 
very tough on other prisoners that they will save  
their own skin.  You know the, the, the instinct 

of survival was very, very strong in ever
ybody and some  people thought through cruelty to 
others you know they will save  their skin and others as I think in my case you know I just tried to 
be inconspicuous you know and, and just 
behave.  You know as a human being.  
 I also you know there, there were prisoners
 who for instance were stealing from other 
prisoners you know bread you know which was puni
shable. If you were caught stealing another 
prisoner™s bread which was you know our, our you 
know food was very meager, it meant that 
this guy, the other prisoner from whom you stole th
e bread, he probably is going to die. So it was 
punishable by death and it was punishable by de
ath, by the prisoners themselves you know  it 
was, they took him to work. Some  of the capos or
 some thing. He was told that this fellow stole 
the bread and they, they killed him.  So there were ma ny terrible things you know which I ma ny 

times I don™t want to reca
ll  them.  Anything else

Q:  Take a tape break here 
  

Interview with Leon a

(#3 Œ  File RG-50.549.01.0012.03.03 Œ duration: 36:41) 
 

Q:  This is tape 3, I™m Dee Roberts with Le
onard Za wacki.  We  had just talked about 
different ways that this has shaped your char
acter, that the Holocaust 
and war experience. How 

to what do you attribute I guess your
 resilience. And your survival 
 

A:  I, I suppose as anybody else you know the will 
to, to survive and to live, to, to live. 
That™s survival instinct.  But ma
ybe it™s stronger in me  than a
nybody else.   And I, I think it™s 
also partially a, you know that I did survive as that
 has a lot to do with it, 
I think.  I, I really do 
think that there is a 
lot you know. Luck has a lot to do w
ith. because you know there were ma ny, 
ma ny ti me s there were very strong people whic
h you thought and they would perish and of 
course once you lost will to, to live you know you 
were finished.  But if you had a strong will to 
live you survived.  
 
Q:  This is sort of off the 
track but did you ever see or 
visit any displaced persons camp. 
 

A: No, I never did.  I never did, no. 

 

Q: Do you keep in touch with other survivors. 

 

A:  I do.  I, I do keep in touch with the fe
llow who escaped with me .  You know  who wa s 
also changed into SS uniform and took the other 
four colleagues of ours 
out of the camp.   
 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  49 
 
Q:  What was his name ?  
 
A:  His name is Alfonse 
Shuminski 
and he is I think he and myself are the only 
survivors of the six who escaped.  I know
 that 3 of them ar
e dead and, and the one we 
never heard of you know so he disappeared.   So
mewhere but I™m sure, I feel that he is 
also dead. And now this Alfonse 
Shuminski
 who lives in Polan d is , is he had a stroke 
but he can, he can move. It wasn™t very severe
 stroke.  But his speech is a little blurred, 
he cannot speak. Do you say blurred 
or the vision is 
blurred.    
 
Q:  Slurred. 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 
Q:  Other people. 
 
A:  Yes and I have other people. I was in t
ouch with one fellow wh o was as I told you 
in Edmonton and he died last year and then ther
e is a fellow who liv es in Menlo Park.  
And I Sometimes am in touch with him. A
nd then I am in touch with in Poland, in 
Krakow, one fellow name is 
Tatatosh Zaleski
.  And then a friend in my home town who 
actually helped me you know and maybe he 
was really the cause that I did survive 
because he introduced me to, to somebody 
and the carpentry you know and I got the 
job as a carpenter. And, I, I 
am in touch with him. I go qu
ite frequently or used to, quite 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  50 
 
frequently go to Poland.  And now since my wif
e is not so well you know I don™t. I, I hope 
to go you know this year.  Hope to go in t
he fall, maybe in the late summer to Poland. 
 
Q:  How ma ny t i me s have you been back to Auschwitz? 

 
A:  Oh I was probably five or six times and 
my wife was there twice with me. I was, I 
was last the year before you know for the anniversary, the 50
th
 anniversary. I was in 
Auschwitz. 
 
Q: What was that like? 

 

A:  Well it was a very, very sad, very sa
d occasion you know. There were ma ny people. 
Frankly I didn™t like that because it was a show 
and I don™t™ agree with 
it. You know there were 
ma ny dignitaries of, from all over and I think 
the survivors were rath
er pushed aside you know 
were as, as I think they should 
be in the forefront and not the 
dignitaries. I thought it was poorly 
organized. It was wrong.  And I think ma ny 
other people thought the same  way.   
 That you know well I 
just didn™t like it. 
 

Q:  What about some  ti me s before. Why would you go back so ma ny ti me s? 

 

A:  Well I went back because there were occas
ions and I wanted to show my wife you know.  
And then I , then I went once, a Jewish girl from
 here, matter of fact she is from Oregon and she 
was an exchange student in Poland and I wanted he
r to see  what it was so I took her there. And 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  51 
 
then I took once my, my great ni ece you know I wanted
 her to see it. So I took her. Only because 
I, I mean for myself I know it. 
 Oh yeah and then I took  once a group 
of, from Medford, you know  some  20 peopl e 
from Medford went and I took them you know as 
a guide. We  opened a Rotary Club in touring 
Poland and afterwards we toured Pola
nd and we went to Auschwitz.  And 
 

Q:  Medford is ten miles from Ashland so th
at you took some  people 
that you knew basically 
 

A: Yes, well there were Rotarians you know a
nd their families and we went actually for a 
tour for the opening of the Rotary club in Poland
 but then we also toured, not only Poland but 
also Czechos lovakia. We were in Prague C
zech some where, but on the wa y we went to 

Auschwitz and they wanted to see Auschwitz.  

 
Q: So the ma in reasons were to share this experience. 
 

A:  Yes, yes.  I 

 

Q: Why did you feel that wa s necessary. 

 

A: Well, first of all I wanted as ma ny peopl
e to know what, what it was like and what the 
sufferings were you know.  What people went th
rough.  Not that you know ma ny of t he, the gas 
chambers and so on destroyed in Auschwitz you know
, in Birkenau actually.  They blew them up 

but there are still ma ny, ma ny things you know wh
ich are there and whic
h indicate you know 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  52 
 
what, what kind of a place it was. 
 Matter of fact when I was desc
ribing because I was serving as 
a guide, I did break down you know. 
 Because it recalls you know for instance you know you witnessed the hangings there 

which were always public. And you know the, nobody is 
as strong as they think they are. So I, I 
did break down. But I always try to
 recover very fast and I do.   
 

Q:  I think you™re allowed to 
break down. In your successful life, what kind of things do you 
attribute to how you survived, what you learned 
and how it shaped you as 
a person to your later 
life, you know as, as you look back. 

 

A:  Well when I came here you know, I, I ,as I said I came without any means and I tried to 

make somet hing on me. And I suppose I™m a mbitious
.  You know to, to and I wanted to achieve 

some thing you know. And I was, I think in my estim
ation I was successful. I didn™t become  rich.  
Money doesn™t ma tter so much  you know but, but
 I am comfortable and, and I think that 
ambition you know is and, and I saw that. I ha
d the knowledge to do 
it. And here I am. 
 

Q:  Did it ma ke you stronger. 

 

A:  I think so yes.  We ll you know of course 
you know the whole world is not perfect and not 
everybody is perfect.  There are things you knowwhich I don™t™ agree with you know and but in, 

in general you know I try to be live my life, l
ead my life you know as, as 
well as I can. But I tell 
you that, I, I think although I was not
 very religious, I lost my  faith. 
 And I, it is I think due to, to 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  53 
 
Auschwitz  in part, although I wasn
™t very religious befo
re that.  But I don™
t™ think there was a 
god in Auschwitz or anywhere.  I don™t™ believe it.  
 You know no ma tter how much you
 pray the more it doesn™t 
mean anything so just, just 
don™t have to face. 

 

Q: You still don™t believe that there is god. 

 

A:  I really don™t think so 
no, no.  I mean ma ybe there is some  being or some thing you know 
but as far as I am concerned, no. I mean 
I don™t™ look, I respec
t everybody™s religion, 
everybody™s beliefs but to me  I don™t,
 I just don™t have any faith.  
 

Q:  Do you think this would happen again? 

 
A:  I suppose so. I think in the if the conditi
ons are  you know very, sometimes I forgot  the 
words I want to, getting senile.   
 If the conditions are right I think that look 
the conditions for Hitler 
to get to power were 
right at that time. you know they were the 
economi cal situation you know and so on. and of 
course everyt hing was.  If all the conditions ar
e you know in place, it, it can happen, it can 
happen.  Look the we all not so long ago you know 
if you take Bosnia which is probably to a 
much smaller extent   but there was st ill clean
si ng, you know killing and so on.  There, there is 
hatred between the religious hatred you know betw
een the Muslims and the Christians and the, 
and the Orthodox people you know in Bosnia.   

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  54 
 
 Yeah, Herzegovina. And they, they are killi
ng not to the extent as you know because it 
was in Hitler Germany it was organized you know
 and it was I think everything written out you 
know, how to do it and ma ybe in Bosnia it was 
spontaneous or not. I 
don™t know but it still 
happened and it can happen.  Look at the killings in, in Africa . you know we have. And, and I 
think it can happen any, anywhere, anyw
ay if the conditions are right.  
 

Q:  Do you ever wonder why you su
rvived and what your purpose is? 
 

A:  Well I, I think I survived first because I 
wanted to.  And secondl
y I think I was lucky.  
And I used my brains or you know my abilities th
e right way.  And that was the reason I, I did 
survive. And the will to, to live.  The will to live.
  It™s a very you know th
e instinct to survive is 
very strong in huma n beings. And if you lose this
, if you lose your will to
 live, you know  then 
you are finished.  Might as 
well lie down and ma ny did you 
know, ma ny people in Auschwitz 
did.  Lose the will. 

 Of course it™s brought on by, by mi streatme
nt, by hunger.  You know specially by hard 
labor.  But you know I think it™s also a lot of lu
ck to do with it.  You 
know if you™re lucky and 
know and help you know strength you know, help each other. 

 

Q: Who helped you, actually let me
 ask you, your purpose, your purpose 
 

A:  My purpose.  We ll, well I think the pur
pose is that you, you want to you know to be 
alive. you wa nt to, to live and see don™t™ wa
nt to be dead you know, that™s a purpose.  
 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  55 
 
Q:  Even now. 
 

A:  Oh well, now, now my purpose well I 
just want to have you know a quiet  and 
comfortable life you know. And hea
lth.  You know in older, it™s 
all important this health you 
know.   Of c ourse you know even it all de
pends on the genes you know which you were born. 
Some  people are, live longer, ot
hers shorter you know and I think 
I my fa ther when he was he 
died, he was 90, almost 94.  93.  And he, he you know he died because he  fell, fell and hit his 

head and probably could have lived longer. My 
mother died because after operation she had an 
operation and she died there when she was 79.  

 So now the purpose and the purpose is also I 
want to say and that™s why I speak to the 
youth, you know  in the high schools and the at co
llege you know the, I want people to know 
what it was.  Maybe it, it ma y be in this way it 
can be prevented in the future.  For anything like 
this to happen again.  That, that™s the purpose. 
And as I said I couldn™
t™ talk about it and I 
wouldn™t talk about it, but now I do and I realiz
e that you know that™s why I also wrote my 
me moirs because I wanted to put it in writing 
what happened. I didn™t write everyt hing and 
didn™t™ see everything. You know th
ere were things and other pris
oners probably saw more, more 
of the horrors you know than I did. 

 But I saw a few of the m and believe me  it 
is enough.  What I saw for any human being to 
see.    

 

Q:  You said you didn™t talk about it mu ch 
before but you obviously kept in touch with 
friends that you could talk to about it. 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  56 
 
A:  Yes, no I, I did, really didn™
t keep too much in touch with 
friends. I, I didn™t, I did meet 
one friend in London, it™s a gi
rl.  (phone ringing) 
 
Q:  We were talking about your friends. 

 

A:  I me t in a friend while I was still in London so
 it was before I emigrated to the States. It 
was in 51. I me t her. She is a Jewish Polish Jewish 
girl  and she worked in
 a typing pool, next to 
my office when I worked in, I worked in the 
central building admi nist
ration building.  And she 
was in the typing pool. There were approxima tely 
ten, ten Jewish girls. She was the only Polish 
girl. There were Slovakian girls,
 Hungarian girls, and one Dutch 
girl. I think one German girl 
and there were altogether ten a
nd they all spoke both, their ow
n language and German and they 
could take shorthand you know in German.   

 And, and I me t her. They all survived. They 
were all Jewish.  They all survived. They 
were evacuated from, from Auschwitz and I 
know from her because 
I met her in London, she 
told me that they all survived. And so I keep in
 touch, I still do keep in
 touch with her.  You 
know once in a while I call her or
 she writes to me  and when 
I am in London I see her.   
 

Q: When you fi rst me t your wife was it very difficu
lt to talk to her about the war or did you 
do that? 

 

A:  I did, but I didn™t go into de
tails. I just told her that I 
was in Auschwitz you know and no 
I didn™t go into details. No, until later.  I. 

 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  57 
 
Q:  How later, how much later? 
 

A:  Oh I you know I really  to talk about it 
when I started writing the me moirs you know and 
it was probably seven years ago, seven years. 

 

Q:  Is it hard to keep it locked up that for so long. 

 

A:  No you know  because I was busy. I concentrat
ed on my work and I didn™t. I just put it, I 
think in this respect I have the 
ability to do to put it aside you k
now and I think that™s what kept 
me  sane ,that I have this ability to push it out
 of my mi nd.  You know, now I can recall it.  Now 
you know that I am more comfortable you know with
 it, I can recall it. 
And it doesn™t™ hurt as, 
although I, as I told you before, I some ti me s have
 nightma res when I talk too much about it. 
Probably will have one tonight.  Don™t worry.  
 
Q:  I™m sorry to hear that. 

 

A:  Well you know I mean you can™t avoid it.  
You can™t avoid it wh
en you start talking 
about it.  

 Now you know the worst part in Auschwitz to me  anyway was the uncertainty which, 

under which we lived.  You know a lthough I did work you know. I had a job. You know I 

worked in an office afterwards and I was not 
mi s t reated, although I didn™
t have any more food 
but I, I had an easy, easy work. But the, th
e uncertainty of life. You, you know although, 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  58 
 
although you work in the office, when you came  to the compound you didn™t™ know what to 
expect.  

 You didn™t know whether they are not going 
to call your name  and take you, you know to 
the desk block and they you know and shoot you 
or hang you or gas you, you know. I, I think in 
my transcript I did say that I, I was luc
ky to escape gassing only by, by a few hours you know. 
So, so you see that that was the un, then what prom
pted us also to escape was that we knew that 
the, the end of the camp was nearing because
 the front was you know we had good information 
because we had the r, radios.  I worked in th
e workshops you know and there were electricians  
who always got the radios for repair.  
 And they of course when they, once they 
repaired the radio they kept it and they 
tuned in, into the BBC you know and so on.
  So we, we had the information and we 
know that and we also knew that there was 
a plan to destroy  the camp you know the 
evidenc e you know. It was called 
Mole
 plan.  
Mole
 was a, a German staff sergeant you 
know in the SS 
oberhauptshungfere 
or something that is.  And he had the plan to 
destroy it you know.   
 And he wanted some  planes and tanks and so
 on and level everything 
but of course  the, 
you know the war effort wouldn™t permit  the Germ
ans to you know given all these things to do 
the job. But we knew it about it and that™s why we
 also escaped because we didn™t know what™s 
going to happen.   
 Now ma ybe some body c a n say it was selfish but
 I don™t know.  If it 
was selfish.  But it 
was pre, you know self-preservat
ion.  I wanted to live.  A
nd you know you couldn™t save the 
whole camp.  The whole camp couldn™t™ escape. 
 Although when we went to the partisans we 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  59 
 
thought that maybe we will be able to liber
ate the camp, but we had you know there were a 
hundred of us and we were poorly arme d.  

 We, we wouldn™t™ have any chance you know to
 do anything like that.  it was impossible.  
 

Q:  Six or seven years ago you started writi
ng your me moirs and talking to people about this. 
what was there anything partic
ularly that happened that ca
use you to want to do this.  
 

A:  Well actually the, the urging 
of some of my friends. American
 friends, none of the friends 
who were in concentration camps. None of th
em, no but when I when I spoke with them you 
know and they knew that I was in the concentrati
on camp then they said well you should write it. 

you should put it on, on paper.   

 

Q:  You were starting to speak at that time.   
 
A:  Oh yes well 

 

Q:  What urged you to speak. 

 

A:  Well not to speak you know where I didn™t go 
in details. I just told them that I was a 
me mber. And then they said well why don™t you 
write your experiences 
you know.  So that, 
that™s when it happened. 

 

Q:  Why did you come  to the US? 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  60 
 
 
A:  That™s a good question.  I, 
I really you know I re
ally didn™t think th
at I would come  so 
fast you know.   you know when I put my na me  i n 
the, I really didn™t.  But  although I was not 

very happy in England.  You know. I, I really didn
™t, dint™ know whether I wanted to go  to the 
United States and my friend you 
know urged, urged me  you know to put my na me . I put and you 
know within I think 3 months I was here.  But not that I regret. I never did. I was very unhappy 

at the beginning. I was unhappy 
and because I was lonely.  

 But, but now I think it™s you know now that 
I know the United States and I know it from 
the east to the west you 
know the south and north I think it
™s a great country. And I wouldn™t 
want to live anywhere else.   And especially here. 

 

Q: How did you  end up in Ashland. 

 
A:  Well a friend of mi ne well first of all I wa
s retiring. I wanted to re
tire and to we wanted 
to retire in you know mo st
 of New Yorkers go to Florida. We ll we
 went to Florida. And I, I can™t 
stand the climate. You know it™s very hot.  
And very humid. Then we thought about North 
Carolina. The same , hot and humid. 

 Then we went to Arizona.  Now there it™s hot
. It was so hot I said 
 no we can™t stand here. 
Then we went to San Diego and there was quite e
xpensive to live there. Y
ou know.  and then this 
fellow, friend of mi ne suggested you know why 
don™t you go to Ashland, Or
egon.  He said I was 
there and you know and he had also a friend there 
in real estate broker. So we came  here. We  
came for four days. You know ma tter of fact we 
drove from San Diego here.  You know, I rented 
a car.  We  came here.  We stayed four days. 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  61 
 
 And the fellow started s
howing us  a, houses.  And then he showed us, this was 
the last house he showed us.  And it was almo
st new.  It was only a year old.  This 
house. And I like, I liked the view and ever
ything and we bought the house. And then we 
went back. We came from Connec ticut act
ually. Stamford, Connecti
cut.  We went back 
to Connecticut. I sold our house there. 
and in 85 we moved here. And, and May 31
st
 we 
came here, May 31
st
 in 85.  
 So I didn™t regret it.  We ll Fr
ieda is, Frieda is used to bi
g cities. I had a consulting job 
while here. We had in San Francisco. We  stayed
 for 3 months in San Francisco.  But now I like 
it. of course it is far you know.  if
 you want to go to Europe, we, 
we have to go from Medford to 
San Francisco, to Portland and then fly take the 
flight you know from the  but it is, it is very 
comfortable.  Nice, ni
ce home, nice house.   
 

Q:  This is the last question. Looking back
 on your life, looking back on your life what do 
you think was, this is a really 
tough question but what does it all mean to you ,  looking back on 
your life. What is your I guess your great
est sense of pride, how about that. 
 

A:  Well I, I tell you the greatest sense of prid
e is that I was able to escape from Auschwitz 
you know.  To, yeah.   I, because it was an ach
ieveme nt whi c h not ma ny people could live, you 
know live up to.  You know.  It, it wa s a great de
cision . because I knew I was playing with my 
life and ma ybe I didn™t realize it then but you know
 the more I come to think of you know it, it 
was a really great undertaking you know that.  
You know that, because so ma ny things could 
have gone wrong.  You know and I could have been
 dead but I, I did it and it required a great 
courage. And I am proud of it.  That I did. 
 That I you know that I wa s  able to outwit, 

Interview with Leon a
rd Za wa cki  62 
 
outwit the Germans and that I despite you know thei
r cruelty and the and I was able to do it.  
And that I am proud of. That I was successful an
d I was able to defeat you know the German 
system.  That I am proud of.   
 

Q:  You me ntioned your survival skills and luck 
but one thing you just me ntioned is your wit.   

You kept your wits about you, your inte
lligence. How did that help you ? 
 

A:  Oh yes, well you know I mean you know
 the planning of the escape you know took  
ma ny you ca n talk about it or wr
ite about it you know in a few 
words or a few sentences you 
know, but it took a long time to prepare for it 
and, and during all th
e preparation you know 
anything could have gone wrong. You had to know 
to whom to trust and who not to trust. And 
you know because there could have been an inform
er who would, although we were, we more or 
less knew each other you know.  
 What we dealt with you know and could trust 
but so it required a lot of preparation, a lot 
of, of thinking and a lot of cunning you know to get it
 all done.  And a lot of trust. We  had to put 
in other people because you couldn™t do it all by 
on your own.  So that I, I am, I a m pr oud of 
that, that I was able to do it.
 Of course I am proud of the other fellows you know who went with 
us, who helped us and we all stuck toge
ther and we were able to do it.   
 

Q: How long of a time period was that
?  How long did it take you to do that? 
 

A:  I, I don™t know.  But probably half a year.

Q:  There were other instances 
in your time  at Auschwitz and ac
tually before and after where 
it really took a 
craftiness you know. 
 
A:  Yeah that™s right. There 
were not ma ny escapes.  Well  
 

Q:  I mean just in your life though that there 
was a craftiness or a sense of knowing when™s 
the right mo ment. 

 

A:  Yes that™s right. Now maybe you know  this was a result of the war.  You know we hated 

the Germans. And whenever we could hurt them
 you know we tried to hu
rt them. And, and you 
had to be cunning and crafty  you know to, to 
cheat you know. To, to do anything you know to  
not to help them you know succeed.  So this of course was during the occupation you know, 

when I lived in Warsaw. 
 And later on you know it carri
ed through into the concentr
ation camp.  You know whe r e 
you also tried you know to do everything you know to
 not to help the Germans, you know to 
prevent them from succ eeding.  And of course it 
was only in a very small   way but still that™s 
what one tried to do. 
 And we were all united in it.  And that, that
 was the best part of it, that people were 
united  you know because we had a common enemy a
nd we stuck toge ther and later on as I said 
when the Communists came  to power , you know it changed. And then people started not trusting 

each other you know because you never knew who 
you talked to, whether he was a Communist 
you know supporter of the governme nt or an
tigovernment you know person you didn™t know.  
 And that divided the people I mean in Poland anyway.
