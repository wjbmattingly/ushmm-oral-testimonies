W ehave prepareda brief slidepresentation to help with his introduction.  
W ebegin with this portrait taken in1940 or1941 of Steve Fenves and his sister 
Estera. Steve was born on June 6, 1931 in Subotica, Yugoslavia.  
 

 
T he arrow on this mapof  Yugoslavia in 1933pointsto Subotica. Steve's 
father Louis was themanager of the printingplantof a
 
Hungarian language daily 
newspaper and would later becom ethe editor of  that same newspaper.  His 

m other Claire was a graphicartist.  In thisphoto we see Louis andClaire at a 

horse race in Suboticain the 1920s.   
 
 
In thisphoto we see Steve andhisf am ily on an outing to the farm in the 
summ er of 1940.  In 1941 Germany attacked Yugoslavia and its ally Hungary 

occupied Steve's town.  Life changed imm ediately for Steve andhisfamily.  Jews 

in Subotica were subjected to Hungarian racial laws which were m odeled after 

those in Germ any.  From  September 1940 toMay 1944 Steve'sf am ily li ved in 

one corner of their apartm ent.  
 
 
In May 1944, Germ any occupied Hungary and Hungarianoccupied 
territories like Subotica.  Soonaf ter, Steve's father was deported toA
u sch wit z,  
while the rest of thefam ily was f orced into aghetto in Subotica.  Atthe end of  

June1944 Steve and som e of hisf am ily m embers were sentto another ghetto 

andthen to Auschwitz.  Here we seeanaerial reconnaissance photo of  

Auschwitz Birkenau taken inSeptem ber1944 by the US Air Force. The arrow 

pointsto thebarrack Steve was in f rom  Juneto October1944.  
 
 
In October1944,Steve was sent to anothercam p at Niederorschel

cam p.  Steve was liberated by theAmericanson April 11. He was placed in a 
f ield hospitalestablished at Buchenwald whic h is seen inthis photo. Four 

m onths later, Steve re
turned to Subotica and was reunited with his father and 

sister, but hisfather died lessthan six m onths af ter returning to Subotica.  

Steve's m otherperished atAuschwitz.  Steve andhis sister imm igrated to the 

United States in 1950.  
 
 
Af t e r a rri vi n g i n
 
the US in 1950, Steve was draf ted into the United States Arm y in 1953. 
Af ter hisdischarge he enrolledat the Cham paign Urbana campusof the University of  Illinois 

where he
 
would eventually earn his PhD in engineering andbegin a 42 year academ ic career 
in the com putingf ieldat the University of  Illinois and laterat Carnegie Mellon inPittsburgh.  

Af ter retiringf rom  Carnegie Mellon in1999, Steve andhis wif e Norma, whom hem arried in 

1955,m oved to theW ashington, DC area where he workedf or 10 years 
at the National 

Institute of Standardsand Technology.  
 

 
Steve and Norma have four children. Gregory is Deanof  theengineering school at the 
Universit y of T exas at Austin. Carol works in the New York City Envi ronmental Protection 

Agency, contracts off i

youngest, Laura, isa hum an resources consultant in theW ashington, DC area.  Steve and 

Norm ahave seven grandchildren between the ages of 6and 26.  I'm  happy Norma is here with 

Steve today.  A little wave.  There we go.

Steve became activewith this m useum.  In addition toparticipating in the First Person 
program , he also volunteers with themuseum's Visitor Services onThursdays.  
 
W ith that, I would liketo ask you to join me inwelcom ing our First Person, Mr. Steven Fenves.  
 
[Applause]
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Thank you.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, thank you som uchfor joining us today.  It'sa pleasure to have you 

here.  You have so much to share with us in a ver y
 
short period of tim e, one hour, so we'll start 
righ t a wa y.  
 

Let's begin, Steve, wit h the early years of your lif e.  You were nearly 10 years old when the 

part of Yugoslavia where you lived was occupied by Hungary and yourf am ily's lif e would be 

forever changed. Before we turn to that tim e, tell us about yourf irstfew years, about your 

fam ily, your lif e, what it was like bef orethe war really hit to your community.  
 
>> Steve Fenves: W ell, I was raised in what I would call anupper m iddle classf am ily, whic h in 

Europeanterm s meant that there was am aid, a cook, a chauffeur and a governess. That was 

how lif e worked ina dirt poor country like Yugoslavia.  If  you could afford a car, you certainly 

couldaff ord supporting anotherfam ily.  I rem em berm y closestf riend's father drove around in 

this im possibly sm all Fiat, which they're again on them arket, andhewas considered self ish by 

the comm unity, because he didn't supportanyone else. 
 
 
T he governess was a ver y im portant person.  We spent m ost of  our ti
m e with her, 
because inthe social setting of m y parents, speaking absolutely f luent and correct, it was 

necessary.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Your governess was f rom  Germ any?

>> Steve Fenves:  Our governess was Germ an, yes.  It wasn't aparticularly observant f
am ily.   
My parents attended services on high holidays, some Saturdays.  Iwent to religious school two 
af ternoons a week after the normal school . And on Saturday afternoons, since regular school 

ended at noon on Saturday, Saturday afternoon there was a youth service, which ended very 

promptly at 3:00.W em ade sure of that,becausethe matinees, the double headerm atinee 

startedat3:00. W eall raced to them ovies.  
 
 
My sister and I didn't have to raceasfast as the othersbecause wehadpassed through 
thepress booth; we didn't have to line up oranything.  That was the life.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourf ather.  You mentioned the newspaper.   
 
>> Steve Fenves:  All right.  
 

>> Bill Benson: T hey'll adjust itf rom  back there if you're having diff iculty hearing. T hank you 

for letting us know, though.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My uncle was three years older.  In high schoolhe became very deeply 

invol ved in a journalist circle, including a couple people who were later very prom inent writers 

in Hungary,
 
and went   af ter baccalaureate went to theuniversity, ostensibly to study law.  
Ever ybody addressedhim  as Dr. Fenves, but there isa revisionist theory now going on that he 

never f inished his law degree because he was so busy being a journalist in Buda
p e st.  
 
 
My f ather imm ediately, after graduationf rom high school, wentto work to support his 
brother.  So when m yuncle started, took over this newspaper and eventually with f undsf rom  

his in laws bought the printing plant, m yf ather becam ethe manager and my uncle died in 

1935, he becam ethe editor of the newspaper.  
 

>> Bill Benson: T he newspaper was, by this tim e,by the standards, it was a liberal 

newspaper.

>> Steve Fenves:  A very liberal newspaper. As liberal as the censorship of royalist 
Yugos
lavia allowed, but considerably m ore liberal than what thefascist government in Hungar y 
would have allowed. Many newspaperm enwere f leeing Hungary, stoppedas theirf irst stop at 

m y f ather'snewspaper before com ing tothewest.  
 

 
W hen I came to the States,there were four Hungary language newspapers,f our 
Hungary language dailies and a Hungarianmonthly literary journal. All f ive of the editors at 

onetim e had workedfor m y father.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ow. Becauseof  theSerbian censors, yourf atherstill had to sendall of  the 

articles tobe reviewed?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  I rem em ber going with m y father every night, thepaper was ready, 

workm en took abreakand we went to the City Hall and the censor readthe paper and x'dout 

things hedidn't want to see.T hat had to be 
chiseled
 
out, then thepresses would roll.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourm other.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My m other was a graphicartist.  Shehad a very famousuncle, very wel l 

known architect, who was a great inf luenceon him . She studied in Budapest.  If ound out now 

thatbecause of the boundary adjustmentat the endof W orldW ar Ishe never f inished he
r 

degree, but she studied afterwards and we have drawings of  herf rom  Vienna, Dresden, 

Venice, Florence andRom e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Perhaps later, youm ight tell us why you have those drawings today.  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  OK.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  On a lighter
 
note, you toldm e that you    W ednesday af ternoon is when the 
governess was off .T hat was a timefor m ischief, because there was no governess. Give us 

an exampleof  som e of the m ischief.

>> Steve Fenves:  My m aternal grandm otherhadthis very old fashionedpeasant house.  On 
W ednesday af ternoons m y sister and ourf ive cousins and I were locked inthere. W edidall 

kinds of things. Theone thatI rem em ber is in aprim itive society like that, canning,f ruits and 

ve ge ta b le s, e tc., it's ab ig th in g.  One
 
day we tookall of  the jar, soaked off allof  the labelsand 
random ly replacedthem  on other jars. 
 
[Laughter]
 
Our grandmother thought that was great.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, thanksf or sharing a senseof  your early lif e. In 1941, Germ any 

i
nvaded Yugoslavia and their ally Hungar y occupied the part of  Yugoslavia where you andyour 
fam ily lived.  From  the first day of  their occupation, your fam ily andyour com munity were 

im mediately subjected to profoundupheaval. T ell us what happened to yourf am ily and your 

lif eonce the Hungarians occupied your comm unity.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My father was escortedout of his off ice at gunpoint on the f irst day of  the 

occupation. T he news paper was takenover by Hungarian authorities and assigned to an 

A r ya n
 
m anager, who was 
hell
-
bent
 
to bankrupt m yf ather.  For example,f reezing personal 
access to hisaccountby charging all of  the labor expenses to thataccount.  
 
 
Part of the apartm entwas taken over. T hatwas not that big aburden,becausethe 
three young officers who were assignedto itwere t wo counts and the prince. Prince 

Esterhazy was oneof  them. T hose who know about Haydn, whofoundthe Esterhazy court 

m oreprof itable than the royal court inLondon, that's the kind of person he was.  All of the 

s
ervants had tobe letgo, gentiles were notallowed to do workf or Jews, and so the three

lieutenants clicked their heels and said" Madam e, I understand that you had let your servants 
go.  Our butler is at madame's disposal."   
 
 
So there was the sight of my m other in the market and a big, ruddy sergeant behind her 
with a shopping basket.  W e had things like that.  
 
 
I'll correct your statement in one place. Some of  Hungarian laws actually predated the 
Germ an laws.  Inparticular, the law called Num erus Clausus, which was enacted in 1921, 

restricting the attendance atplaces of highereducation.  Jews were restricted to the 

percentage in the whole population, which was about6%.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Meaning no morethan 6% of university students could be Jewish?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  That started grade5,f irst year of academ ic high school. I was in thef irst 

group that had to take this exam . Again,fortunately, m yf ather was out of work, so he coached 

m eall sum mer, and Iwas one of the nine who were taken into school, which m attered very 

little because we were sitting in the back, never addressedby the teachers,never responded if  

you raised your hand.W e were just sitting there like turnips.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that the coaching your f ather did was probably a big source of 

support tohim.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  I'mquite sure, yeah.  Because he considered himself a Hungarian at heart.  

Hef ought in the Hungarian, Austro Hungarian arm y inW orldW ar I,andthis was something 

that he did quite willingly
.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Plushe was outof  work.  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said it gave him m eaning at that point. 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes.

>> Bill Benson:  Your sister, was she able to continue her schooling?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  No,
 
she didn't,but there was a school run by    Iforget now what order of  
nunsthat accepted Jewish students, and she continued there. Both of  us, the thing that hurt 

them ost was when we  were not allowed to go tothe movies andnot allowed to goto the lo
c a l 

beach. T hat really eats intoone'spride when you're 13   11, 12,13years old.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather lost his job.  How did thefam ily m ake endsmeet?  How did you 

putfood on the table?  
 
>> Steve Fenves: W esold everything we could, includingm y ver y la rge stam p collection that I 

hadbeen very proud of , silver ware, whatever,  a small vineyard m y f ather owned where the 

picture was taken.  My m other was knitting, weaving, doing    
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about thetrial that was where your
 
f ather was charged.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Iforget, 1942,1943,to legalize the takeover of  the plant there was a trial, 

andonly m y sister attended.  Nobody elsef rom  thefam ily couldtake it.  But all of the 

accusations,one of the accusations was that not respecting the Christian religion. T he paper 

ran on Sunday toproduce Monday's paper, and thefact that all of the other papersalso had 

Monday issues, whichhad to be composed and printedonSunday didn'tm atter. So it was a 

t e rrib le  t ria l.   
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: W hatwas the outcom e?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  It justified the takeover of the plantthree years earlier.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  During that time, and you lived under those circum stances until 1944.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Right.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Did  
you know what was happening elsewhere inEurope, both in term s of the 

war, but what was happening to Jews?

>> Steve Fenves:  Notin any specif ic detail,but we knew where theGerm ans were, we knew    
there was som etrickling of refugeeseven earlier, even before1941. So there was a general 

sense, but impossible to fathom  and im possible tounderstand. Particularly with the mentality 

of m y parents' generation.  
 
 
My t wo cousins were in Hungarian labor service, very cruel ser vice.  Oneof  them  died 
there.
  
T hey were home on abreak. They went to their m other,andby that tim e the southern 
shore of the Danube was controlledby the partisans. T hey told their m other that they're goi ng 

to swim  across the Danube at night and join the partisans.  My auntputh

said, no

Jewish boy is going to swim  across the Danubeatnight and jointhose 
people in theforest.  And that was that. Thatwas the mentality thatbased what was to com e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You wouldbe inthose circum stances,then of course in 1944 the war is turned 

against the Germ ans and Hungary is preparing to capitulate tothe allies, and that is when 

Germ any m oved quickly, once they realized the Hungarians would capitulate,the Germans 

m oved quickly to occupy Hungary, and the areas including your town. W ith theGermans,the 

conditions turned inf initely worse im m ediately.   Tell us what it was like when the Germ ans took 

control and whathappened after that. 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  First of all, I don't believe Ihad seen aGerman,one German soldier during 

thatentireperiod.  Germ ans had nom orethan 600 people in theentire country, one of them  

Eichmann, of course. And all of  thedeportations, loading into the cars, etc., was done by the 

Hungarian gendarm erie.  You can seepictures in the exhibition, theblack hats andblack cock 

feathers in thehats.  
 
 
Som y f atherand the intelligentsia of the town were taken within the f irst48hourstoa

W e were ordered tomove into a ghetto strung out acrossf rom thefreight yards.  T here 
was this belief  that Jews were in control with America daily, and that if the Jews are placed 
next to thef reight yards, the Am ericansare not going tobom b. Crazy things were going on 

ever ywhere.  
 
 
So we were put into this    
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, before you go on, youdescribed tom e that when you weref orced into 

that ghetto, thatday is oneof  the grimm estmem ories you have.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes.
  
W e were ordered to leave. We packed, asany good Jewish m other 
packing, packed way toom uch stuff. As we were leaving, I don't know how the word cam e 

about,but certainly the stairwa y up tothe secondf loor apartm ent was lined with people wait    

se co n

yellin g, spitting at us as we lef t. T hat's pretty m uch amemory that stays with m e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e there was one exception.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  The exception was our form er cook, whom we let go three years earlier, 

who was in that line. Went in with the others, collectedm y m other's cookbook, adiary m y 

m other kept whenboth of her children were very sm all, and into one folder she collected 

together as 
m any of the drawings and lithographsof m y m other that she couldfind.  
 
 
T he cookbook you can see in the exhibit across thehall. And we have the drawings, 
lithographs,etchings. She returned those tous af ter the war.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  So now you're forced into this ghetto.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes, just a couple weeks,with our m aternal grandm other, pressed intoone 

room .  No sanitary facilities, nof ood. Our cook would come at nightclandestinely to bring us 

food. T errible conditions. T henone morning, linedupand taken toa small village that was

days af ter that, we wer e taken to Auschwitz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout Auschwit z, while you were i n the ghetto, you toldm e 

that you received a very nice birthday present.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes, m y birthday is June 6, 1944, Dday.  Ihad perm ission to work outside.  

I was work ing f or theform er employee of m y father's.  I was outsidethe ghetto w

Auschwit z f or, I think, five days and six nights in 
railroad cars,30,40, 50 people jamm ed intoa car.  Nof ood,nodrink, no sanitary f acilities, 

nothing.  People were dying.  People were going m ad.  Until we arrived into this sighting, which 

turned out
 
to be Auschwit z, and shouts, yells, scream s, dogs barking.  Unloadedf rom the 
trains.  Some of youmay have seen" Schindler's List" and the scene where they arrive onthe 

Auschwitz platf orm ,a gracef ul sloping platform  was m adeavailableto them to march 
wi t h

Anyhow, that was the last time I saw m y m other.  My sister went
 
a second way, I went a

brokendown shoes and marched at doubletim e intoone of the barracks.  
 
 
Auschwitz was largel y an exterm ination cam p, as you know, but it was alsoone huge 
warehouse of slave labor.  Thousandsandthousands of people,m ale andf emale, inbarracks.  

Forem enf rom factories, m ilitary or civil ian, would come and you would be escort
ed to one of  
the compounds, and they would make their selections. Usually the inm ates, male orf emale, 

naked.  I don't know ifsom ebody was looking for   I don't know if nudity was an important 

factor,but it was an importantf actor.  
 
 
Most of  the peopl

Auschwitz, the trustees, the couples, 
were Germ an crim inals with green triangles, andthey needed an interpreter, and they picked 

m e, and Ibecam e an interpreter.  Justm aybe a second ladle off ood was gi ven tom e. 
 
 
T hen late in Augustthere was a big c

Oneof  them  cam e over and askedf ora    if there was som ebody wh o could interpret German,

>> Steve Fenves:  Inside Auschwitz.  Even if resistancem eant black m arketeering, with I was 

ver y a big part of  resistance. T hat changedmy lif e.  Upto that point,there was absolutely no 

hope of survi ving, and suddenly I had a reason, an opportunity to dosom ething, Ihad a reason 

to want to survi ve.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Steve, I think you told me another thing that changed your attitudeaboutthe 

wi ll to survi ve cam eaf ter the killing of the gyp sies. W ill you tell us about that? 
 
>> Steve Fenves: W ewere in that camp, com pound C. The nightof  August, I forget now the 

date.  It's well documented.  About half  adozen of the barracks on the compound, in the 

picture that you showed, were gyps y f am ilies.  And thenfam ilies meaning oldm en, wom en 

and children.  No work age m en. And one night an entire   that entire portion was 

exterm inated. Thatf ollowing day, that's when    
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were right nearthere?  
 
>> Steve Fenves: W ewere locked down, butwe could hear it, couldhear everything.  T
he 
following m orning we r ealized thebig change of  the   that thetrustees were a different group 

of  pe o p l e.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now that you've kind of  gotten thisnew wi ll to live, what did you dothen?  

You're inside   
 
>> Steve Fenves:  One of the things,one of m y jobs was tom eet wheneverybody else wa s

bem et, had to be escorted, hadtobe translatedfor, thenescorted back. T hat was one    
occasionally, 
I won't say al ways, but occasionally som ething Idid. 
 
 
One sourceof  black market f ood was the arriving transports. W henever a train pulled in 
it was inm ates who emptied the trains.W e alwa ys had a group of our people sweeping the 

gra vel behind the lastbarracks. W hen the guards weren't looking,they also went through, and 

cans of sardines and whatever could be thrown over theelectrif iedf ence was thrown over the 

fence. W e would pick it up. T hat'sf odderf ortheblackm arket.  
 
 
For a while, I worked in a roof  repair detail. Had apushcart with abarrel of pitch, with a 
couple rows of  roof paper, and wentf rom  com pound to com poundfixin g roof s.  Hopeless 

tasks, because these places were ver y poorly built.  But in one of thewomen's com pounds I 

m e t m
y sister, which was seldom  occurring in Auschwitz.  She toldm ethat ourmotherhad 
been takenaway, andthen I rushedto convert all m y blackm arket goods to geta scarf and a 

sweater and gloves toher before she was shipped out on atransport.  
 
 
So that
 
was thef allof 1944.  Our cam p wasclosing down. W eknew that the Russians 
were    theSoviets wer e closer. Sothe Polish trustees decided to sm uggle m eout.  Nobody 

would pick m ef or transport, butI got pushedin, went up toone of the transporters, 
there's a 
single person who wants to trade places,  they would assurehim  that he could get out.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout that,oneof  the insideform s of resistance you were 

doing, one of the things was sort of  keep count of who was in the cam psand get that 

informationoutside. Say som ething aboutthat.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  There were comm andos, groups working outsidethefence, the Polish 

resistance was never very farf rom  there. Lists of  arrivals, notby nam ebut at leastby 

trainloa

information   
 
>> Bill Benson: W as sm uggled out. So theother inm ates with you have decided to sm uggle 

you out, get you out ofAuschwitz.  T ell usabout that. 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  That was it.  There were cruel games that theSSplayed all the tim e. Very 

caref ul selection, loading on the train, the train made a roundtrip, arrived
 
on the sam e inbound 
platf orm  andeverybody was gassed.  So it took som e intelligence to f igureout whether a 

transport appeared safe or not. I picked oneof  those, shovedm e in the line.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you lef t, you were give n a tattooas you were leaving Auschwit z.

going out.

Niederorschel.T he train pulled in, we were linedup, SSoff icer gave a speech, theforem an 

gave a speech, a Hungarian translator gave a speech, and thenthe forem an walks u

So the Auschwitz trustees had grilled me   drilled m e night after ni
ght f or any 
eventuality that they thought could happen tom e. T his was not oneof  them.  
 
 
So Ihad tothinkfaston m y f eet, andI said, "W ell, sir, with thism any new inm ates they 
thought that you would need another interpreter.  "
 
 
T he guy looked at m e
,said, "Oh, yeah, that'sa good idea."   
 
 
But that was the sm all part. Then we were let in, seated at benches, at tables, which 
was a novelty, gi ven hot f ood, which was a bigger novelt y.  As we were eating, a Hungarian 
interpreter satnext tom e, and aman who turnedout tobea Czechtextile engineer sat next to 

m eon theother side, and they started grilling m e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto rem em ber you were 14 years of age.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes.  "W ho are you?  How come your clothing isso muchbett
er than the 
others?  How com e thef orem an knows you?"
 
 
T hat nightI was taken to the room of  thetwo trustees, who were both German 
comm unists, in camp since 1933, and this was 1944, so you can imagine what kindof  person 

survi ves 11 years of  this.  And I was grilled by them . There was a substantial number of Soviet 

POW s in the cam p, because Germany didn'thonor the Geneva Convention with respecttothe 

Soviets.  So their representative im m ediately continues in Russian,and the Czech guy in 

Czech.  I don't
 
know if anybody spokePolishat that tim e.  
 
 
So they gril led me.  Yeah, there was a gypsy i n charge of cleaning the barracks, was a 
gypsy.  T hey were all grilling m e.  
 
 
As the night turned, it sort of  started turning around, because they realized thatI
 
knew a 
lot more about Auschwitz than they did.  Andthey were starting to ask m e questions. T he

gypsy guy had heard about the exterm inationof  the gypsies.  One of the young people said he 
hadheard that wom enwere selectedfor worki ng in brothelsf or th
e  SS .  
 

 
And then I lied, I said,no, I never heard of it. I don't think so, because I've seen lotsof  
wom en selections, and I've never seenone where wom en were selectedfor their looks. 

W hether I convinced them  or not, Idon't know.  
 
 
Anyhow, at the end of the night, I was accepted in the resistance organization there. I 
was put to work next to the Hungarian interpreters onthe assem bly line, Messerschm itt 

airplanes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's what you m ade there?

W orking our workdays, every half  hour the Claxton soundsand thenew wing moves 
through the next
 
assem bly section.  Very hard work.  But conditions were order of m agnitude 
better than Auschwitz.  At least you got something warm  to eat twice a day. The bread was 

m aybe 1/4 sawdust rather than3/4 sawdust.  There was a cot with a small straw m attress 
only 
sharedby two people,rather than by seven.  It was really an amazing experience to see so 

m any people doing som any things just because they wanted to stay alive.  I m ean, you 

certainly expect that there are shoemakers who know how tof ix shoes with
 
soles cut f rom 
discarded tires that were lying around the cam p, and shoenails cut f rom  discarded boards; 

thatthere were tailors who couldm end clothes with threadand needles barteredf rom the

T here were these twobrothers, Hungarian Jews, caught in Holland,diamond grinders,
 
who were attem pting to grind prescription lenses out of bottom s ofm ilk bottlesfound inthe 

road.  
 
 
T here were teachers,m aybe about a dozenof  us kids m y age, they decided our

and French.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter workin g 14 hours on aMesserschm itt wing?  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  Yes.  Yeah.  Being part of that was a very im portant part of m y life.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou were doing the labor on the wings, the Mes
se rschm it t  win gs,  yo u  
and yourfellow inm ates tried to do sabotage,and get away with it.  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  Yeah.  Oneof m y goodf riends was installing theelectrical cabling.  

Occasionally, he would cut theentirebundle,andthen just as he got to the
 
station f or a new 
win g he would cut thebundle and report thatit came damagedf rom theprevious station.  
 
 
Now, al ways m y job was with dentist'sm irrorexam ining every ri vet, the backof  every 
ri vet to see that it was properly done, and looking f or tears in the alum inum  which can 

propagate.  
 
 
So we were the only ones allowed to stop the production line. W itha perfectly well 
driven ri vet, preparing it was bad, stop the production, drill it out andreplace it with a charge 

driven ri vet that rivets itself .  If you saw a tear, that was nottoo obvious, you could signal to the 

next station where the Soviets were paintingcam ouf lagepaints tom ake surethat they put a 

big glob of goop so that the tear would not bevisible.

bef ore you do, I want you to tellus how you were able to get news about what was going on 

with the war.  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  Most of  theGerman workers were    didn't wantanything to do with us. 

T here was one of them who m ade big business during his lunch hour. T hey had lunch hours, 

we didn't.  He would read thepaper, thenhewould signal on wherehe was putting away the 

paper in aplace where one of us would pick it up. Of  course, that was German news, whic h 

wasn't ver y reliable.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  It kept you somewhat abreast.  From  there where were you sent?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  April 1, there was analarm, that the cam p was going to be em ptied. A 

group of  the younger people in the resistance group wantedtoputup an armed resistance.  

T he older guys decided against it. T hey didn't know where the Am ericans were. W edidn't 

know where the Germans were. W e were quite sure we could overpower our guards,butnot if  

reinforcem ents cam e in.  So we went onamarch, 11 days through,to Buchenwald.

following m orning by civilians, prodding them with pitchforks, prodding them a couple 
centimetersdeep into the f lesh with pitchforks.  So probably 1/3of  the peopledied.  
 
 
But it was slow enough that we got to Buchenwald less than48hours before.  I slept 
through the liberation.  
 
>> B i
ll Benson:  Before you got to Buchenwald there was anextraordinary incident where you 
stopped.  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  That was part of the slowing things down.  Our guards were replaced by a 

new set of  guards came down f rom  Buchenwald, andour guards were ta
k en  ba c k .  A n d a n 

inm ate,a couple, a trustee was with the SS off icers, and I went   I snuck up to him , andhe 

said that the camp was being em ptied, we should slow down asm uch as we can.  So at night 

we decideda couplepeople would hide so the count would be off,and the SS would have to 

f ind them , because they had thatm any bodies dead oralive to deliver. That's what we did.  

W estalledfor at least12 hours.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he ones who hid?

You stalled getting to Buchenwald, but eventually yo u got there?

1948, butby July of  1945, theIron Curtain was there. T he Dutch, Norwegian, French inmates 

of  Buchenwald were gone, in 48 hours at most. T hose of us who wanted to go back to the

W etried to resum ea new life, but Hitler's Yugoslavia was not it, so we escaped.

t wo  
f iancés
, m y sister and I, six of us, escapedf ive diff erent

train, on the repatriation train there was a group of Yugoslavia POW  officers who hadbeen in 

c a m p s
ince1941,andm y sister maintained contact with one of them . One of them had a 
m edium level position in the Ministry of Exterior, and he produced two passportsand two exit 

visas, which were genuine except that he was notauthorized todoso.  
 
 
So the French,on that basis, gave us a 30day transit visa, and the Italianson that 
basis gave us a24hour transit visa, and we got outto France. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You wentdiff erent paths, didn't you?

f iancés
 
all escaped, as 
you could tell by themap.  Four kilom eters north was the Hungary border.  T hey went through 

Hungary.  M y cousin Yannish did the, what should I say, m ost rom antic thing.  Hebef riended a 

young Swiss lad y at the Swiss consulate in Zagrab.  She was in charge of  renewing passports.  

She found a suitable passport, poured ink on one page 
--
  
no
, no, she gave thepassport tom y 
cousin, who gotto Switzerland, sent it back to her. She poured ink on the page that had the 

certif icatesand went crying to the consul, saying this is what shedid.  He calm ed herdown 

and issuedthe gentlem an anew pass
po rt.  
 
 
T he Swiss are very cle ver.  T hey recognizedhere was somebody receiving mail who

hada very attractive offer in 
Venezuela, sothef our of  them  went to Venezuela. My sister and I waitedthree years until the

couldn't live up to the commitment. T he affidavit said.  Butthat was our destination.W e were 

lookingf or aplacef or the six of  ustobe together. W e couldn'tm ake it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  1950, you arrive in the United States.  Before we wrap up, a couple questions 

I want toask you bef ore we finish up.  One isin 1953 you're draf ted into the United States 

arm y, and that was during the KoreanW ar.  You hoped that your language skills would allow 

you to be
 
able to get into an intelligence servi ce. W hat happened? 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  During basic trainingm y entire basictraining com pany had ordersfor 

Korea.  One guy thatIcorresponded with af ter wards, who kepttrack, knew of  at least 60 

peoplef rom  that one com pany who were kille d in Korea.  
 
 
At the last m inute, about 10 of usfor various reasons got our orderschanged, and I was 
sent to an intelligence battalion inStuttgart, at headquarters in Feingen.  
 
 
Several weeks later, the officer of  theday calls m e in, says, "Soldier, we can't use you 
here.  You don'thavecitizenship. W e can't get clearancefor you."

He said," Normal thing in a case likethis is to send you back to infantry, basic training,

engineering.  If you canf ind aposition asa draftsman,I'd appreciate it." T hat's how I ended

>> Steve Fenves:  Af ter I got out, while I was in service, m y sister married in Chicago, andI 

don't know

yeah, through am utual f riendmet Norma's brotherand sister in law.  Norma's 
sist e r-

the States.  My sister and Horowitz had daughters about the sam e age, and they becam e good 

f riends. One day   during breaks at school I lived at m y sister's. One day I went there, was a 

sign on the door," Come andm eetm eat thishouse."  My sister was  not there, but Norm awas 

therebaby sitting with her niece. That'show we m et.

Obviously, you had com e to the UnitedStates with your sister Estera who had alsobeenat 

Auschwitz with you.  I learned today from you that in the

July of  last year your sister passed 
away.  T ell us a little bit 
about her.  
 

>> Steve Fenves:  She came out of the war quite different. As I said, neither of us were very 

observant. I'm probably m ore observant now than I would have been inm y family.  She just 

totally, absolutely, totally di vorced herself f rom  her Je
wishness, f rom  her camp experience, 

except that she did do a Spielberg tape. Shetotally divorced herself . We would go and say 

we have to get ready for Rosh Hashanah.  "W hat is that? W hat isthat?"
