Enoughof  thehousekeeping.T he lif e stories of  Holocaust survi vors  transcend thedecades.W hat 

you are about tohearfrom Sam is one individual's account, one individual's experience during the 

periodof  the Holocaust.W e have prepared abrief slidepresentation to helporient you to Sam 's 

sto ry. 
 
W ebegin with this story of a young Sam  Ponczak, andhis sister Gisele, taken in 1946. 
 
Sam was born in1937in W arsaw, the capitalof  Poland, and that's indicated by the redarrow here. 

Here we see Sam 'sparents, hisfather, Jacob, was a tailor andhis mother,Sarah, a seam stress. 

T heseportraits were taken in1940.Is that right? 
 
Germ any startedW orld W arIIby invading Poland onSeptem ber 1, 1939. W hen war broke out Sam 's 

father escaped toSoviet controlledterritory. W hile young Sam andhis mother rem ained inW arsaw. 

In thisphoto, we see Germ an troops parading throughW arsaw af terthe surrenderof  Poland. 
 
In October 19
40, theGerm ans established aghetto inW arsaw anddecreed all Jewish residents 

m ove into this walled
-
off area.W e see hereaphoto of the wall that separatedthis sectionof the city. 
So it's a sort of urban prison, a neighborhood enclosed inthe center o
f  th e  city. 
 
T he building where Sam  and hisf am ily already li ved was in them iddle of the ghetto. I dowant to 

m entionthis is a special date inhistory. Yesterday, April 19, marked the anniversary of  the startof  the 

W arsaw Ghetto Uprising, which was a violent revolt started by Jews in the ghetto against the 

Germ ans,against all odds. It was thef irst urban uprising against Nazi Germany and was the largest 

andm ost sym bolic of Jewish uprisings. A few thousand Jews heldoff,f ar outnumbered by Germ an 

troops
,for alm ost am onth.So it is very si gnif icant we're talking aboutW arsaw today with Sam . 
 
Sam 'smother in Novem ber of 1940 took therisk to escape the ghetto.W e'll hear thosedetails in a 

m om en t .  
 
Eventually Sam and his m other,pictured here justaf ter the war, were ableto reunite with hisf ather. 

T hey were soon sent to a forced labor camp in Siberia, in theSoviet Union,then to atown called 

Sykt yvkar in thenorthern region of Kom i. Finally, in 1944,they were sent to the town of  Kherson in 

Ukraine, where Giselewas born.Thef am ily r em ained in Khersonf or the rem ainder of the war. T his 

picture was taken of them af terthef am ily returned to Poland. 
 
W ith that context, I would like to invite our very special guest Sam Ponczak to takethe stage, please. 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Good morning.

>> Edna Friedberg: So you know, Sam  and Ihave anunderstanding, we'll cover a lot of  ground 
today, andat tim es I will likel y have to interrupt him . He's not insulted. We just want tom ake sure we 

get through the
 
full trajectory of what is a very complicated story. 
 
Let's start at your start, your beginning. You were born in December1937 in W arsaw. Tell us a little 

about yourf am ily, please. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ell, m y parents cam ef rom  sm all little towns known as staples in Poland.T hey left 

the towns in their early teens because therewas no work and living was hard. So they m oved to 

W arsaw where they met. Actually, that's where m y father learnedatradeas an apprentice, that trade 

being a tailor. My m other as we
ll.  
 
W ell, we lived in anarea that later becam epart of the ghetto. It was ver y heavil y Jewish populated. 

Actually, before the war, about 1/3of W arsaw's population was Jewi sh. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: The largest Jewish area in Europe? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:T hat's
 
right. Very diverse politically, culturally, and so on. My f ather wasa, well, I 
guess a good tailor,and became also aunion organizer or what have you. Even thoughhe f inished 

only, I think, eitherf our orf ive grades of  school, he was well versed in po
litics. He told me that as a 

young m anheactually read " Das Kapital"  the Bible of Marxist theory. Anyhow, that'saboutm y 

parents.
 
My m other hada large fam ily, three brothersandparents,brothers who were carpenters and 

shoem akers, what have you. From small towns. My parents were not, eventhough they were 

educated, inthe religion, in Jewish f aith, they were not really practicing Jews at thetim e. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: When war started inSeptember 1939, you were 
--
 
I th in km y m ic is off. OK .W hen  
the war
 
started you were a baby, right? A toddler? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Yes. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:W hat did your parentsdo days and weeks af terGerm any invaded? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ell, the war startedby aerial bom barding of W arsaw. T here was notmuch anti
-
a i rc ra f t art
illery. Basically, the GermanLuf twaffe had controlover the skies and they burned, they 
straf ed, they destroyed anything at will. T om y knowledge, in thatf irst m onthsof  war about20,000 
people were killed. Never m ind wounded.And it was sheerbedlam , be
cause on the third day, as f ar 

as I know, of  course, things I'm  telling you is what I learned later orfrom  whatm y parentswere telling 

m e, onthe thirdday the governm ent disappeared.They just packed up, went to Rom ania,ended up 

in London. So there was
 
no one in charge. 
 
T he hunger and lackof water, electricity cam e in very quickl y. Som etim es I was thinking aboutm y 

parents.T here was a guy 29 and his wif e, 28,Sara,and I was a toddler, and they probably did not 

know what to do with them selves, where to run.T hey did not know what was com ing ahead. 
 
So they m ade thedecision that they wil l separate. Not divorce, but separate,becausem y father 

wanted to 
--
 
no, I must digress f or a second. Germ any attacked Poland on Septem ber 1. On 
September 17, I believe, Soviet Russia attacked Polandf rom  theeast. So by theend of Septem ber 

there was no Poland. It was either Germ an occupied partof Polandor Soviet occupiedpart of  

Poland.

Som y f atherdecided to try his fateand escape to the Soviet occupied part of Poland. Most of  the 
people did not know, but there was a treaty between Hitler and Stalin of  nonaggression. So that was 

a deal that was basically unknown to the population. But the reality was ver y, ver y tough. 
 
Anyhow, he escaped to the Russian side, and while m y m other decidedto stay becausefam ily ties, 
brothers, herparents and so on. So luckily, the pact allowedf ora postal correspondence. So they 

apparently knew wher e they were, and I know during that time at som etimes m y f ather was working 

as a tailor in the Belarus part of Russia. I was with m y m other. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: They were able to exchange letters? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Ipresum e. Unfortunately, Iwas either too young or stupid to ask the right questions 

when I could.W hen I got to the point where Iknew what I wanted toask, they weren't around 

anym ore.So there was a gap in m y knowledge, butI do know that the postalagreementexisted and 

people wrote f rom  one side 
to the other. 
 
At som epoint,m y m other saw the light,as itwere, and decided to escape. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Let's backupa second though.T hef irst yearW arsaw is occupied. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Then in October 1940, the Germ ans established the ghetto. As we described it, it 

was around where you lived. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Basically closed the wall,f inished the wall around the ghetto. I think thatm onths 
af ter they attackedtheJews were already being forced, Jews f rom  the area surroun
ding W arsaw, 

were being forced into the areaof  thefuture ghetto, andthey were all identif ied with anarmband. You 

couldn't take off the arm bandunder penalty of death. If  you weref ound that youtook off the arm band 

and you were Jewish, there was notrial; youwere shot on the spot. 
 
So that was the situation. Of course, thePolish population that lived in the old ghetto partwas f orced 

tom ove out, and the Jewish populationf rom the rest ofW arsaw, as well as f rom aroundW arsaw, 

was f orced tomove in. 
 
I personally think that the Germ ans at that time didnot have a specif ic planonhow to liquidateall the 
Jews, but they did know that it would help if we keep them separatef rom  the restof thepopulation 

and concentrated. Eventually, behinda wall. So thattook careof  itself in som e ways, becausem aybe 

100,000 of them  starved to deathorf rom  illnesses.T he majority wer e sent to their death inplanned 

train cars, wagons, cars to T reblinka andother death cam ps, whosesole purpose was to kill. There 

wa s  n
o work. T here was no plan 
--
 
well, m aybe I'm  gettingm yself ahead. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: It's OK. You've describedthe conditions inthe ghetto. Just to make sure that the 

audienceunderstands, when we're talking about tensof  thousandsof  peoplef orced into
 
this area, it's 
an area of justafew square m iles.Soextrem ely crowded. There is no good sanitation. Food 

shortages,disease. Really, a quite hellish place. Your mother was extraordinary to escapef rom  the 

ghetto with her,her not quite 3
-
year
-
old son.T ell us about how shearranged that. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Idon't know exactly the details, but som ehow she m ade itto thetrain station. She 

got intoa wagon, andshe toldm e that apriest had planted him self  inf ront of her,toldher to take off 

the arm band.
 
He stood inf ront of both of us, and whenever she says thepolice,there was a so
-
called 
bluepolice orthe gendarm es going around checking thedocuments. 
 

 
 
5
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Polish police? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Yes, Polish police, but also German militant pol
ice. The priest was ver y sm art. He 
was pointing to theback saying "W ell, the wom an with the kid isf rom m y parish."  Being thathe was 
dressedas a priest,I guess that was goodenough. So inhindsight,I don't know who theman was, 

but I'm  sure he saved 
m y lif e .  
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Your m other then literally walked, right, walked f rom  German territory? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ell, I don't know exactly h ow she m ade it.T he border between the Soviet 
occupied and theGerm an occupied part was a river, the river Bug. She knew enough that this river 

usedtof reeze up in the winter, around the wintertime. Because shecam e from thatarea. So she 

probably knew. 
 
Now, how she m ade it, where she stopped, who helped her, Idon't know. But somehow she made it 
to  the  rive r. P
robably with the help of some guides, but shedecided that she will cross the river at 
night, not to be visible, andthat's what exactly happened. I don't know the date, but shebasically 

carried me and whatever else she could,andshe startedto walk atnight onthat ice. 
 
I was a toddler, andof  course, thepoor wom an was slipping and sliding. She wasf alling. Ihad a ball. 

I thought it was really funny. She was telling m e later thatI was laughing so loud that shewas af raid 

thateither the Germ ans or the Soviets will shootus. Because it carries, I guess, on the river. So to 

shutm eup, shef ounda bunchof pictures that she carried with her,and gave them tom e to 

entertain.By the tim ewe got to the Soviet side,all the pictures wer e tornup, so I stan
d before you 

guilty of  destroying all m y f am ily's picturesf rom  bef ore the war. So you see stuff f rom during the war 

andaf ter the war. Of course,m y sister still cannotf orgive m ef or that. But what can I tell you? 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: I think when talking
 
about history, sometimes it's easy toforget what it's like tobe 
a parentand tobe in this stressf ul situation,andthat she justhad a toddler she had to keep quiet. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right, right. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Both humorousand terrifying stor y.
 
Once she madethis dangerous journey, she 
reunited with your f ather in Soviet territory, c orrect? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: I think I know that she was telling m ethat apparently, we were caught by the Soviet 

borderpatrol.She was telling m eaboutdogs. So I assum e we were caught. I don't know how long we 

were kept, but eventually we were reunited withm y f ather. Now, these are stillm om ents that Idon't 

rem em ber, but Ido rem em ber when we wer e sent to aplace called Kolthaus, which was inf am ous in 

so m e wa ys. It w
as a gulag, those who know Russian history. T he czars sent theirenem ies to gulags 
in Siberia. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Aprison cam p. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right. My earliest recollection, self
-
awareness, which was from  thatplace, the 
gulag, it was essentially a labor cam p. It wasnot just a Jewish laborcam p.T here were Poles, Jews, 

probably som eother people. 
 
T he cam p was in them iddle oftheT aiga, so it was guarded,butI don't remember any Russian or 

Soviet soldier with amachine gun or whatever standing over
 
the people. But you couldn't escape 
anyhow, because there was nowhere toescape. It was T aiga, it was woodsf or hundreds of m iles. It's 

 
 
6
 
around afew hundredm iles southof  theArctic Circle. So there was lots of woods and I remem ber 
beingf or som e time livi ng in a yurt, like an Indian teepee.A large teepee, but Mongolian style. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: A tent? 
 
>>
 
Sam  Ponczak: Right.T he locals, the Natives, were of  Mongolianor Tartar extractionand spoke 
their Kom i language. Isuppose I started to understand Russian. My m em oriesbecam e more vi vid 

andI rem em berthe cam p, I rem em ber m yf ather standing in the river
 
up to his neck,pushing the logs 
of  the trees thatthey just hand cut, with som eotherpeople.I think Ido remember that the people 

looked very strange. They never sm iled.They never sm iled.T hey were strange. Many, m any years 

later, 20, 30 years later, I askedm y father,W hat was it about thesepeople? WhydoI remem ber 

them  the way I described? He said,W ell, these were people who were mostly imm igrants, m ostly 

Jews, Poles, and they were put to work at som ething ver y hard.T hey were tailors.T ailors work hard, 

but they don't have to cut big treesand get in the river, pushing them  around.T here were people who 

were doctors, accountants, younam e it.T hey were just notused to that physical, hard work. 
 
Of course,f ood was rationed.T here were people who had so
-
called bad habits.T hey sm oked.T here 
was no tobacco. They couldn't go and buy cigarettes, so they smoked moss,for exam ple.Those who 
liked tohave adrink, there was no vodka orwine, certainly. Butf orsom e strange reason, they had 

cologne. Later
 
on, Ifound out itdoes lotsof  things to the brain whenyou drink 
--
  
>> Edna Friedberg: Cologne like perfume? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right. There was a lotof  dying and hunger andexhaustion,etc.That'sthe kindof  

expressions that I remem ber. 
 
T hen, som etim e later,we were sent to another place calledSyktyvk ar, we were sent by abarge. I 

rem em ber being af ew days on som e barge.And in the town we we re gi ven a place to live, and m y 

father resum ed his work as atailor. My m other was a seam stress.They didn't know what to do with 

m e, so I was hanging around with them  inthef actoriesf ora while. 
 
So I rem ember them  sewing these winter jacketsf ortheSoviet Army. I suppose itm ust have been 
endof 1941, because I'm  guessing that was already the tim e whenthe war between theGerm ans 

andthe Soviets started, in the summ er of 1941. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: To clarify for a second.In thef irst place where you were, very rem ote,desolate, 

near theArctic Circle, when describing the labor that your parentsand others were doing, they were 

notpaidfor this, this was forced labor? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: No,they got paid by food.T here was nopaym ent. They were given theportionof  
--
 

there were cardsand later on I rem ember they were cutting out, they got a pieceof  butter or s
ome 
breador meat or whatever. It was all rationed.T hey were rationingthe cards. 
 
I must pointout, it was not justf or these refugees. If I rem em ber, Ithink the local population had 

m ade,m ore or less, the sam e thing.T hey were also poor.They also lived m iserably. So there was no 

differences. Notm uch difference between the local natives who wer e not drafted, becausem ostof  

the Soviet young people, women,m en, were draf ted to the war, to the Arm y, andthose who remained 

were m ostly older people. 
 
>> E
dna Friedberg:W hile you were in the Soviet Union, your m other becam epregnant, did she not? 
 

 
 
7
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Yes. Yes. That'sa painf ulm em ory, becauseI dorem em ber my twin brothers. 
E xcu se  m e.  
 
>> Edna Friedberg: It's OK.T ake your time. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: I rem em ber they were born, and then I rem em ber they died. Maybe it was another 

few m onths. Idon't know why.W enever discussed it. But I rem ember. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Sam , while you were in the Soviet Union under theseharsh conditions, did you 

attend s
chool at all? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Yes, I did. I guessaf ter a while I was sent to whatwas equivalent tomaybe 

kindergarten in Kom i, and the thing that isfunny, becauseI didn't know what it was, I saw an 

elephant, a real, live elephant, in thatSiberia, and
 
I couldn't stop wondering. 
 
Now, when you thinkabout it, when the Russians were withdrawin g from  the Germanonslaught, they 

m oved everything they could, including theanim als in the zoo, and this animalfound its way to 

Siberia. I do remember it. 
 
I  a l re
ady started to becom e aware that therewas a war. T he way I became aware, because in that 
place there was a loudspeaker attached to acorner between the ceiling and the walls, andever y day 

in a very, very serious voice som e speaker was announcing that" Our brave soldiers have withdra wn 

in organized f ashion f rom"  such
-
and
-
such town. T hey didn't say retreated, they say withdrawn to 
another town. Andthat went on. 
 
So som ehow, you becom e aware this is a war going on,f ora kid alm ostany situation,as long as
 
they're not very hungry, is like anormal situation.T hat'show it is, you know. Youm akea toy, you 

play with it, and if  itbreaks you makeanothertoy. 
 
T hen I remem ber, it must have been after 1942 andthef am ous battle of  Stalingrad happening, 
because
 
I remember the sam e voice announcing that"T oday our glorious Arm y "  Blah, blah, blah 
" Has conquered"  orf reed som e town. So thewar was going the righ t way.  
 
>> Edna Friedberg: The glorious Arm y was the Soviet Arm y? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Of  course.Theenem y
 
was  the German Arm y, of  course. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: I will interrupt onem ore second to make sure the audience is with us.Sam 
m entioned that Germ any and the Soviet Union had a pact, they wer e Allies. T hen in June1941, the 

Germ ans betrayed that pact and launched a surprise attack against the Soviet Union.SoSam and 

hisf am ily had been in friendly
-
to
-
Germ anterritory, now we're in territory that is enem ies toGerm any. 
 
You're in Ukrainefor several years then at this point, right? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W hat happened was thatthe Soviet governm ent was trying to persuadepeople like 

m y f athertoassum eSoviet citizenship or whatever. They chose not to do that, because they did not 

know what was going on inPoland.All that tim e, they were notaware. But they decided not to take 

this offer, and I think because of that the Soviet governm ent sent usf rom Siberia to Ukraine, which 

was m uch closer tothe Polish territory. It was warm er, of  course,and there werem any hundreds of  

thousands of people like us. 
 

 
 
8
 
It's n ot r
elevant,but the Soviet governm ent had a pact with thePolish governm ent in exile, and they 
tried toform an Arm y tofight the Germ ans,but that's part of the history and I don't want tobore you 
with  th a t. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Sam , when you say that your parents were not aware of  what was going on in 

Poland, explain what youm ean. You mean thef am ily? You m eanthe Holocaust? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: No,they were not aware, because there was nothing in the 
--
 
well, Poland in 1943 
was not liberated yet.Liberation cam e in sum mer of 1944, for parts of  Poland. Now, theSoviet press, 

tom y knowledge, did not write m uch, because they didn't have correspondents orTV like today, on 

thef ront. Sonothing was known, andthere was nobody to write to and nobody to receive let
t e rs  f rom. 
 
So it was one big unknown that was hanging over their heads,but 
--
 
m aybe I'lldigress for a moment, 
because it just sohappens thatthe person that I called a sister, whowas not m y blood sister, showed 

up with her son.T his was the daughterof  people who
 
took inm y father when he was ateenager and 
he was anapprentice.T hey li ved inW arsaw. So he becam ealmost like a son to them. 
 
Unfortunately, when we all escaped, thatfamily sta yed. One day, basically, shipped toT reblinka tobe 

k ille d .  T h a t girl wa s  
actually begged by her parents to jum poff  thetrain, which shedid.She atthe 

tim e was a teenager. She had16or 17 
--
 
shewas 16 or 17 years old. She jum ped off themoving 
train, was wounded, etc. 
 
T o makea long story short, she survived, and shem ade itthroughthe front area between the two 
arm ies,and she spenta year lookingf or us, because she som ehow knew that we were som ewhere in 

Russia. Lo and behold, shefoundus in Ukraine.W hen she showed up, my f ather said,T hat's your 

sist e r.   
>> Edna Friedberg: You mentioned that yourentire conscious life,aware lif e at thispoint, is in the 
chaosof  war. Did you identif y as Jewish?W hen did thatawarenesssink in and how? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Yeah, I think 
--
 
well, I don't know. I cannot speakfor American teenagers now, how 
they gro w up.W hen Iwas growing up, I did not know that I was Jewish. I was just a kid.W orryin g 
about playing stuff ,food, elephants, what have you. 
 
F irs t  t im e  I 
--
 
actually, two events. In 1945, inthefall of 1945,the war has ended already. My f ather 
tookm etoa place,because we lived outside of  the town, hetook me toa place where there was a 

big room .I didn't know what it was.W e went in, sat down, andtherewas a bunch of uniform ed young 

m en who were basically m oving like that,
 
likeI'm  showing you. I didn't know what it m eant. I didn't 
know what it was. But the thing that struckm e was that these men were crying. I didn't expect a 

unif orm ed man with their guns at their side crying. I just couldn't im agine that. But it stayedwi
th  m e . 
 
Many years when I already lef t Poland, I askedm y f ather,W here was I?W hat was that place?Sohe 

explained tom e that it was Yom  Kippur, you know, the Jewish day of askingf orf orgiveness, and 

these were Jewish m en,m em bersof  theSoviet Arm y, who
 
had just returned f rom  Europe, f rom  
Poland and Germany. He said they were cr yi ng because of what they saw. Of  course, I understood. 
 
So then, you know, the Jewish and the Holocaustbecam e a little bitm ore familiar. Thenext event 

was a day when the three
 
of us,m y parents and I, went toam arket.It was people were 
--
 
f a rm e rs  
were selling their products. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Outdoor market? 
 

 
 
9
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Outdoor m arket, right.W ewalked by a guy, a m an, who was a paraplegic, had no 
legs, andhe was sitting on a little platform  with wheels and pushinghim self . He turned tous, and 

basically yell ing, sayin g, You Jews! How the heck,etc.,used otherexpletives, did you survi ve? He 

calledm y f ather Jacob, because every Je w was a Jacob, and every female was a
 
Sara. So he called 
them  that. He said, How did you survi ve?W hy didn't Hitlerf inish you off? 
 
I couldn't understand that.So whenI askedm y f ather, he gave m ea lecture about Judaism , what it 

m eant,etc.Sothen, you know, being a Jew was not a very interesting situation, I suppose. But that, if  

you 
--
 
that'sm y basically a wareness that, yeah, I was a Jewish kid. T hat's it. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: InMay 1945, the war ends.W hendid yourf am ily return to Poland, and how? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ereturned in 1946,
 
in February. It was a long, long journey. Ittook about three 
weeks to getf rom  Ukraine to this place in Poland.In them eantim e,I had a sister already at that tim e, 
who was born in 1945. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: How did you travel to Poland? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:
 
W e traveled in cattle cars, like packed 
--
 
Im ean, itwas not sealed likepeople who 
were travelin g to theirdoom ,but it was went, it was open, it was uncomfortable, etc.,and we went 
through Poland. 
 
Now, I did not see some of the greetings thatsom e other trains saw, butapparently they were not 

f riendly, they were not received f riendly on the Polish side.Butanyhow, we ended up going to what is 

now known as lower Silesia. Ineed to digress for am om ent. 
 
Many of  you know probably about thepactbetween Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt, andthese three 

people decided what is the 
--
 
what are going to be the new borders of Poland.They graciously ceded 
theeastern part of Germ any, or some of the easternpartof  Germ any, to Poland,and they took the 

eastern
 
part of Polandand gave it to Ukraine. 
 
So the place we cam ewas still had the German name, Reichenbach, Reichenberg or Reichenbach. I 

forgot. But anyhow, it was basically a town alm ost voidof  people.The only people there were elderly 

Germ ans, wom en and
 
m en, and 
--
 
Reichenbach. Yeah, that was Reichenbach. Rather notdestroyed. 
It was a small, little Germ antown. 
 
At the sam e time, there were trains of people like us com ingf rom  Russia. In my case, we were f rom 

W arsaw, butW arsaw was destroyed. It was lit
erally about 90
-
som e percent leveled. T here was 
nothing standing.W ewere automatically sent toanarea that had apartments, streets, etc., and the 

sam e time there was a Polish population thatlived in the eastern part ofPoland, that now suddenly 

becam e S
oviets. Many of m y f riends f rom  there. They had tof ind 
--
 
andthey who either survived 
thereonplace, in place, by hard
-
to
-
believe conditions, some hidingin a godforsaken holesom ewhere 
or hiding in woods,or being hiddenby Sol Polish peopleor even Ukranians.Those people could not 

f ind a place to live either, because of the complications with the what happens to the apartm ents, the 

shopsof  the Jews that were killed. 
 
So all these people were going west, and ended up inthe towns likethis Reichenbach, which later 
becam e Dzierzoniow. I t's hardtobelieve, butthere were 25,000,30,000 Jews in oneplacein this little 

to wn . 
 

 
 
10
 
I should addtoo, that's thef irst time Iunderstood, I didn'tunderstand at the time, but I saw ethnic 
cleansing, because what happened was that thefew Germ ans that rem ained were im politely asked to 

m ove on, to get the heck out, move to Germ any, where ver, eastern,western, becauseat that time all 

these things were notwell
-
def ined.T alking about 1946. 
 
So Ido rem ember these poor oldpeoplepacking their belongings in these baby carriages, because 

that seem ed like everyonehad ababy carriage, with nobabies, andthey were going to thetrain 

station. Eventually, they appeared.T he old lady, we were told this is your apartm ent, was 
gone af ter 

af ew m onths. I don't know where. I don't know who she was. But we ended up, I endedup, 

discovering a real apartm ent, with a kitchen and a room  anda bathroom, even though thebathroom  

was near the staircase, onthe stairwell, but nevertheless it was notan outhouse. 
 
So I was a very happy kid. I didn't know Polish, of course, because then Russianbecam em y f irst 

language. Andnow I had to learn how to speak Polish. But anyhow,  that's another story. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Part of why it is confusing, it was a confusing time. T here were peoplebeing 
m oved outof  where they had lived, people com ing back whohad been gonef or years. Just for a 

senseof  context, Sam 's story is typical of m any hundreds of thousands of people.W e tend tothinkof  

the expe
rienceof  Polish Jews as being in ghettos and concentrationcam ps, very f ormal places, but 

of  approxim ately 3m illion Jewish people wholived in Poland beforethe war, about250,000survi ved 

by being in the Soviet Union.T hey were " lucky enough"  to notbe in German territory, andthey came 

back to places where their neighbors were not necessarily glad to see them return. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right, right. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:W e have af ew m orem inutes.I want to ask youa couple m ore questions. Your 

parents returned, other Polish Jews returned,hoping tof ind theirf amilies, their extendedf am ilies. Did 

your parentsf indany relatives alive? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: No.W edidn'tf indany. Although, unknown to us,a cousin of mine, whostill li ves in 
New York, was ali ve
 
but we did not know. 
 
You need to understand that we were the lucky f am ily.W e werean intactfamily. T here wer e two 

parents and children. That was a rarity in 1946 and 1947. 
 
T ypically, there was a single m an, a single wom an,and kids, therewere not toom any kids in this 

to wn . 
 
But things I do rem ember, rem indedm ea little bitof  9/11 because you remem ber 9/11 happened, 

and suddenly on the walls of  thatarea, whatever walls there were, suddenly you saw posters 
--
 
not 
posters,but signs " Has anybody seen m y uncle?"  I rem em berthatin Poland in 1946. Inthe building 

where there was a Jewish comm ittee, there were handwritten notes,in Yiddish, in Polish,any 

language, looking fo
r  m em be r s  of  f am i l y.  
 
Now, being a unitfam ily, m y m other was very kind person, so she invited people to com efor dinner 

or have adrink. At that tim e, Ialready startedto understand Yiddish,because that's whatmy parents 

talked. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: The languageof  European Jews, EastEuropean Jews. 
 

 
 
11
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right, languagethat Jews use. I didn't have a choice, though I listenedto what was 
happening around, with men sitting, som etimes crying, drinking vodka. But it invariably the topic was 

have 
you seen?W hatdo you know of? Haveyou seen? Etc., etc. 
 
Oneof  the things that stays with m e isthe point that those who survi ve the concentration cam ps, of 

course, we didn't, we weren't in the concentration camps,buttheywere sayin g that these who wer
e 
selected to diethat day were m arched to their death. AndI 
--
 
thereare lotsof  young people, I'm  not 
going to go into it, but they were looking at those who were sparedfor that day, and they 
--
 
invariably 
thatthem e repeated itself, saying, Rem em ber, telling what you've seen. Tellabout it. 
 
You know, it's like saying these arepeople,and they m entionedthey knew where they wer e going. 

T hey were not surprised. Men, children, old, young, whatever. 
 
So thisbusiness of rem embering. Now, m any, m any years
 
later, recently, say 10, 8, 7, 8 years ago, I 
was translating somem aterialf rom  Polish into English, andthe topic was thosepeople who were 

interested were in their 80s, some 90s,butthey were youngsters in 1939.T hey were school kids, and 

Polish, not Jewish, and they were asked to tell what they saw looking f romoutside into these ghettos, 

even sometimes concentration cam ps. 
 
I remember af ew tapes where they described the groupof  boys sitting or hanging aroundon the side 

of  road, watching how a colum nof  Jews is being m arched to their execution in some Jewish 

cem etery or in aforest. And it was the same thing these people wer e yelling out tothe kids on the 
side road "Pray to Jesus! Pray to God!T ell ever ybody what happens to us!T ell everybody!"
 
Yo u
 
know, then when I saw these tapes, I rem em ber the theme:T ell, tell. And thenI realize where it 
cam ef rom . So that basically becam em y m otivation for working here and being will ing to talk aboutall 
that stuff and doing translation. I thank you. 
 
>> E d n a
 
Friedberg: Thank you.W e're com ing soon tothe closeof our program .We do want to allow 
tim efor afew questions. If you have a questionfor Sam , I askthatyou approachone of the 

m icrophones in theaisle. In them eantime, we'll start with a questionif
 
we have onef rom Twitter. I'll 
just read.W hat do you hope students getoutof  their visit to themuseum? Douglas brown is asking. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ell, I hope that they learna piece of history, realhistory. T his is what happened. 

I'm  oneof  the lucky ones. I was 
--
 
our generation is going. And especially in the world wher e there is 
so muchdenial, som uch incredulity and, youknow, som e peoplef eel that they canm anipulateand 

change it, modif y it to serve their purposes.So m y only hope thattosome it will stay as a sad 

m om ent inhistory of  mans inhum anity toothers. 
 
It's true. It'shappened. AndI do notm ean tosay that nothing good,we need to learnf rom  that. 
Unfortunately, I see that notm uch is learned. ButI have to adm it I had a happy lif e.W hen I came 

here in1964,I was standing onthe plank of the SS United States,which was aflagship,andIf elt that 

it was a com ing homem om ent, likethat Am erica acceptedm e. 
 
So, you know, there is good f uture inf ront ofyou guys, and girls. But it's good to know thereality. It's 

good to know history. It's im portant to know. 
 
T here's aphilosopher in Israel,his name is Yehuda Bauer, and theguy is tryin g to modif y theT en 
Comm andments. Headds the 11th com mandm ent, I tell it to the young people, is do 
not allow 

yourself  to be a victim .He has in m indprobably bull ying in that case, bullying, etc. 
 

 
 
12
 
His 12th comm andm ent is do not be a perpetrator. Don't be abully. But he says them ost im portant is 
the13th: Donot be indifferent.W hen you see something that isbad, react. Don't turn away. I think 

that should be, inm y m ind, them ost im portant lessonfor the kids,andfor everybody f or thatm atter. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you.T hank you, Sam . 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:T hank you. 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Don't get up yet. Do we have a question? Yeah,please, come.W e have afew 

m inutes. 
 
>> M y question was yo u talked about in the ghettos how people would get sick and stuff. Did anyone 

in your fam ily get sick? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: I'm sorry, in the ghettos were organized in largecities and in sm all cities, in Poland 
and in Ukraineand Lithuania, inall theseplaces that were conquered by the Germ an Army. Am  I 

answering the question? 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: He wanted to know if  anyone in yourf am ily was sick or died in
 
ghettos, 
specif ically in your f amily, if  you know what happened to them? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:W ell, I do not know f oraf act, but there was a person who mentioned som ething to 

m y f atheraf ter the war. It turns out that the deal that was made between m y father
 
and my m other 
about let me go east and see what it is like,thenI'll bring you over. OK? 
 
In our case, it has a happy ending, because we were connected. In the case of m y uncle, who was 

thefather of m y cousin that survi ved, apparently he went east, and because they were supposed to 

m eet and they m et,did m eet, their paths crossed. So he returned apparently toPoland,and 

som ebody m entioned that they saw him  in theW arsaw ghetto. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: He was never seen again af terthat? 
 
>>
 
Sam  Ponczak: Never seen. Most likely perished. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Yes, these two, then we'll close. 
 
>> I know you said that you realized there was a war going on around the country, butdid you really 

realize the severity of the situation around Europe?
  
>> Sam  Ponczak: No,I did not. I don'tthinkthata kidhas interestor capacity to understand the world 
problem  or Europe's problem .T hey're concerned with the imm ediate surrounding.T here's af ather, 

m other,other sibling or somebody to play with, that's your world, nom atter how unhappy they m ay 

be,as long as they're not very angr y. 
 
Is thatm y understanding of what goes on inthem indof a sm all child, right? Idon't think there is a 
child that is so smart, therem ay be, that knows about geopolitics and what was going on in Polandor 

in Hollandor in Russia. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: There was less accessto inf ormation also. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Of  course. 
 

 
 
13
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Even for adults. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak:T heparents didn't know what was going on. 
 
>> E d n a
 
Friedberg: OK, yes? Last question. 
 
>> Mine is m oreof  a point of clarif ication. In the pamphlet it speaksof your sister that wasborn in 
Ukraine. Is this the sister that was Belarusianand came andthef ather said this is your sister? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: No,two separate people. But because this was 
--
 
when she came to us,the war 
was aboutover.W ell,within a few m onths.W eprobably knew f rom  her what was going i n her lif e, 

and she saw a lot of atrocities. She was older. She's at least12or 15 years older than I am. But m y 

father realizedf rom what 
--
 
shedescribed thetrain to T reblinkaand she was literally pushed off  to 
survi ve. So thatm y f ather realized this was an orphan, presumed she's an orphan. He said she'sm y 

sister. That'show strong hefelt.W e were alltogether.She marriedfrom m y house. She just passed 

away a f ew weeks ago. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: It thenthere was a new baby born. 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: Right. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:W e're justabout outof  tim e. It isour traditionhere at FirstPerson
 
that our f irst 
person guest has the last word. I have af avor to ask. Af ter Sam 's closing thoughts, we'd like totake a 
portrait of him  with all of  you behind standing.W henhe isf inished, if  you canplease stand in place, 

we would really appreciate it. 
 
Sam, any closing thoughts? 
 
>> Sam  Ponczak: No,I thank everybody f or com ing and willing to lis ten tom y story. I hopeyou draw 

conclusions that you draw. I hope it's not indifference, because Ibelieve strongly if  you canget 

invol ved, get involved. 
 
Do  
something good.Thank you. 
 
[Applause]
