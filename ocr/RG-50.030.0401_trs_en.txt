RACHEL BIELICKA GURDUS and SU LAMIF SHREYBER 
ZHABINSKAYA 
 
August 17, 1999 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: I™ll just begi
n and have you both say your full names again. 
Rachel: Okay. 
Sulami f: My full name ?  In -- in -- I don™t know
 what I told you, in several l-languages it™s 
different.  

Q: The name that you go by now. 

S: By now I am still having the Russian way, Sulamit, because I came  here with papers, Russian 

papers, so it was written Sulamit. 

R: So just tell Sulamit. 

S: Sulami f. I  am sorry, Sulami f. Not t, but f on this -- on the ba -- Sulami f. 

R: Like is in your doc
uments [indecipherable] 
S: Like in my passport, 
like that , S-u- l-a- m- i-f. 

Q: And your last name ?  

S: Zhabinskaya. A big, long one. I 
would like to change it to Zh
abinski like my husba nd™s name , 
because we have different name s, you know, the 
Slavic -- Slavic countries, in Poland and in 
Russia, in nu -- in Lithuania, the ending -- ending
s of the family na me s are different for me n and 
for women. If you ra -- marry a man who is Zhab
inski, you will be -- or Zhabinskaya, it™s in 
Russian way, or Zhabinska, it™s in Polish way, 
or Zhabinskaynia, in Lithuanian way. But we 
want choose some thing.  

Q: Rachel? 

R: Rachel Gurdus. Simple.

S: Yeah. There is no ending, so she is happy. 
Q: Over the last two days, 
you both spoke about your experien
ces during the Holocaust, and you 
both referred to each other quite a bit, because you spent mu ch of that time together. So I want to 

go back to when you first began spending time t
ogether. I -- I suppose it
 was in the ghetto. 
S: Yeah. 

Q: Y-You were sort of pushed together by your fa
milies. If you could just  say a little bit about -- 
about how you understood that. D-Di d your parents 
say you must always be together, or was it 
because you were both gi rls, or  -- 

S: No, it was my -- my f -- my parents didn™t say 
anything to me . They -- as Rachel told you, my 
father was -- told the family th
at if my brother loves Rachel, so
 I™ll love her too. And she has to 
be in our family. So that™s it, no mo re c
onversations, we™re done. It
 was like a point of 
[indecipherable] yeah, that™s it. And then we were
 pushed together to sleep together. So sh -- I 
found her like a -- like a -- know, 
she protects me . Like I was a child and she was already a 
young lady, like she was 20, I was 15. It was a diffe
rence then. And she was protecting me  in 
ma ny cases. So I liked it. Now -- 

Q: Rachel, the -- mm-hm?  

S: Mm-hm?   

R: And lately we were protecting each other, 
I would think. And we were happy that we were 
together, because first of all it 
was easier to go through, and secondl
y we were very attached to 
each other, and very li -- loved each ot her. She 
was small, I was caring, afraid for her life, only 
not to be separated from me . And as you see,
 we went through th
e whole war together.

Q: Things were so confusing in those times
 that you ended up living with your boyfriend™s 
fa mily. I me an, that wouldn™t have happened if ther
e hadn™t been a war. Wh
at was that like for 
you to be all of a sudden thrust into 
his fa mily, you weren't married yet -- 
R: In the beginning was very scary, 
because I still, in spite of my
 age, I was childish. And then 
we were very busy, afraid what would happe
n, what would be happening tomorrow, what 
happened yesterday. And I reme mber sitting in
 the window watching how he™s comi ng from 
where, being afraid because I knew that he ha
s some  weapons under his coat. Wa s he caught or 
not?  
S: What are -- what are y
ou talking about, the ghetto? 
R: Yes. 

S: Or the -- after?  And y
ou asked her about the get -- 
Q: I asked about the ghetto. 

R: Yes. 
S: Mm-h m, mm-h m, mm-h m.  
R: And you know, she was studying ghetto, as -- she™s 
told you that she bel
ongs to a club. I also 
belong to the club, but I was busy 
working outside the ghetto. And it was a pleasure to meet in 
the evening again and talking about
 [indecipherable] or talking about
 the situation in ghetto and 
what will happen and what should we do, should 
we fight in the ghetto, should we go out?  And 
Luta, today is she there, and there will be an ac
tion, and she runs away to the city, to Veronica. 
And the parents was scary over our life. 

S: Was scared. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401

R: And how to go through day afte
r day with food, and with -- we 
were busy with all kinds of 
thoughts. And that was really very hard to be in
 love and be surrounded by fa -- with a lot of 
people, and you don™t have your privacy -- 
S: Private time together. 

R: Yeah, but still, I think I was happy in that tim
e that I have him, and have the family, and came  
into the [indecipherable] I saw that it™s 
a noble pri -- family. And you know, every day was 
scary, what™s the next  day will bring you. 

Q: Did you and Josef plan to get ma rried? Did you talk about that? 

R: Of course we did. We  were waiting until thewa r will be ended and we were thinki ng how it 

would work out, how it will be, how it --  how nice 
it will be. And even the people who lived with 
us in the same  room, li ke engineer Konitsky and 
his daughter, she said, oy Ra
chel, I want to live 
long enough to see you when you™ll be fa -- boss 
of your -- when you™ll be free. Yeah, you know. 
S: My fa mily was good to her. My mother told me, she is my daughter, not you. Cause I never 
listened to my mother. 
R: [indecipherable] 

S: But it™s true. 

R: Her mother la 
-- [indecipherable]  
S: My fa mily loved her, she -- she was really ve
ry devoted to our fa mily, very lovely, very good. 
And I think she felt that we 
love her too. The parents -- 
R: And her father was a teacher of my older 
sister Luba. In school, in gymnasium, and in 
technical. Do you know that Luba 
wa s the last [indecipherable] 
S: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. She was one girl
, you know, a mong -- among the boys in technical 
school.

Q: Your fa mily really adopted Rachel. 
S: Yeah, yeah. And I think -- I think she felt like
 -- like a daughter in our family, not like a 
adopted child, but a daughter.  

Q: So, were you conscious of -- of -- of 
your parents -- well, I guess your father -- 
S: Yeah. 

Q: -- gave you this order, really, don™t run away
 from Rachel. And was that some thing that you 
kept in your mi nd?  

S: Yeah, of course, yes. Yes, ha --  

R: We were very much devoted, 
through all the year
s, and you -- 
S: My father was for me  like 
I -- I don™t know, in some  [indeci
pherable] feel like such a 
devotion, such a -- he was -- I know 
that people were talking about 
him very highly, that he was 
a very honest and very noble person, and I felt also
 like that. Then, after y
ears, I thought -- I felt 
a little bit different. I -- I am accusing him -- I 
cannot say accusing him, it™s too strong, but I 
think that he destroyed the fa m
ily. He didn™t allow my mother to
 emigrate, and he didn™t allow 
my mother to -- to run fr om the Germans the fi rst day. So that was it. 

R: No, don™t say it. 

S: Yeah, it™s true. You have to 
look -- the truth has eyes. That™s 
it. It™s too much responsibility, 

he took over a big responsibility to say no, 
I don™t want it. Well, what do you mean you don™t 
want it?  You are responsible for 
your wife and children. That™s it. 
R: In the ghetto she used to teach me physics and chemistry. 

S: He teach you. 

R: He. 

S: Mm-h m. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401

R: And I reme mber him telling, Rachel, wh
atever you do, whatever profession you choose, 
reme mber one thing, the physics and chemistry you have to know -- 

S: Mathematics. 

R: -- mathematics and chemistry you have to know -- 

S: And phi -- and physics, yeah. Yeah. 

R: I said, good. 

S: Is a ma tter of all knowledge is ma thematics. 

R: Yeah. 

S: He believed it, and I believe it too. 

Q: I want to take you forward to the time  in th
e cemetery where it™s the liquidation of the ghetto. 
At this point your father and your br
other have already been taken away. 
S: Yeah. 

R: And my fathera
nd my brother-in-law. 
Q: Also. Okay. And you briefly fi
nd your mothers, but then you™re
 separated again. A-At that 
mome nt, when you go to the right, are 
you physically next  to each other? 
S: To each ot her? 

Q: Are you standing next to each other? 

R: Yes. 

S: Of course. When we went through the gate 
-- I don™t reme mber, you went the first? Because I 
r e me mb e r  my  mo m,  my  mo m w a s  b e h i n d  
me . So probably you were the first -- 
R: I don™t reme mber. 

S: -- like I said, I was th
e second [indecipherable]  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401

Q: I mean, did you -- it seems like such a chaotic 
scene, did you -- did you hold onto each other, 
or you were just able to stay
 physically close, so that you 
would get in the same wagon? 
S: Yeah, we were -- of course we were watc
hing not to be separate
d, of course, yes.  
R: We  were scared. We  were not -- we didn™
t know where we are going, what will happen. We  
saw the tragedy of a lot 
of people, that children
 were left over, and -- 
S: I didn™t touch this point. I didn™t touch becau
se a loss o -- a lot of youn
g mothers left their chil 
-- small children behind, not to go to the left with
 them. Okay, I didn't touch it, it™s too -- it™s 
difficult to take. One thing is if a grown-up, it™s no
t a grown-up, but it™s not a small child that is 
leaving the parents, another thing 
is when the parents are leaving, 
the mother is leaving th -- her 
children. Cause that™s life. That what people di
d. Not all. Her sister  
[indecipherable] went 
together with her son. Her other sist
er went together with her mother. 
R: They™re willing to live -- 

S: It™s so strong. 
R: It™s very strong.  
S: Mm-h m. 

R: Very, very strong. If 
your mi nd is still open.  

Q: Did you both always have that, 
or -- or were there time s that when one was ma ybe losing the 
will to live? 

S: I don™t think so. 

R: No. 

S: No. 

R: I never lose the will -- 

S: Lost. I don™t think so.

R: I hope that my bro -- boyfriend will survive, as
 I did. And in the last mo me nt when we were 
already free, we find out that he peri
shed, and her other family perished.  
S: My mother will not survive,
 so I knew it. I knew at once. 
She told me  in the ghetto, and you 
knew -- you knew probably that she had [ind
ecipherable] I don™t know how it™s in -- 
R: Yeah, but even when people hadit, not everybody could kill them -- 
S: No, no, I -- I think that she was a br ave woma n, 
because even with such difficult times, so -- a 
small amount of people committed suicide. Ther
e were some people in -- before the Germans 
came into Wilna, some families were already -- co mmitted suicide. They didn™t want  to go 

through it. Reme mber?  And -- but after that
 -- no, everybody wanted to survive for 

[indecipherable] survive. 

Q: How do you think having each other kept you going? 

R: All the time I thought about is 
that it™s -- we survive because 
we have each other. There were 
situations when, you know, you were not so strong any more , to go on. 
S: Yeah. 
Q: Certainly at the -- the end, wh
en Luta was so sick, you just kept pushing. She -- she described 
you in the f-far mhouse after liberation. 

S: Yeah. 

Q: That you were very energetic, you were
 throwing clothes away, and washing and -- 
S: Cooking.  

Q: -- I couldn™t help but thi
nk, where did you get that energy? 

S: The energy was from the happiness to be fr
ee, because she was not deadly sick, thank God. I 
was deadly sick. But I couldn™t -- 

R: This was a terr ible time when 
all the people was already free -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
9 
 
S: Right. 
R: -- and trying to start and trying 
to establish your life, and she ha
s to be in the hospital, so -- 
S: Dying. 

R: -- sick -- 

S: Absolute dying. 

R: -- for -- for years, in 
and out. It™s very hard.  
S: But I survived. And I had time I was [indeciph
erable] to study and to give birth to three 
children.  

R: You know, in the -- in the age of 17, when 
you have tuberculosis, is [indecipherable]  

S: Yeah. 

R: Or you are dying when you™re su
rviving, you are a normal person. 
S: Yeah. 

R: After awhile. It™s a very da
ngerous age for 
tuberculosis.  
S: For every deadly diseases. 

R: Yeah. 

S: 17. 

Q: So was there ever anything that -- in any mome
nt that Rachel said to you or did, that really 
became something that you held on to? 

S: I couldn™t understand that? 

Q: Wa s there ever anything 
that she said to you -- 
S: Mm-h m. 

Q: -- do this, don™t do this, always reme mber this
. Wa s there anything that
 she said to you that 
you sort of kept? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401

R: I don™t know. I want to tell you one thing, that 
when she was very sick, after the fourth time , 
her future husband came from the -- 
S: Army. 

R: -- army, and he was very in love with her.
 And he did -- and he didn't stop to comi ng every 
day, and several times -- 

S: To comi ng to caring. 

R: -- yeah, caring very much. And Vera
 was very much caring with her. 
S: Veronica. 

R: And Dina [indecipherable] was caring about 
her. She was surrounded with lovely people who 
were very much caring about her, and we -- she ha
d to get we ll. As much as -- even the doctors 
of the hospital loved her and want her to be healthy. 

S: But the -- then, it doesn™t mean I had to be healthy, you know, it doesn™t -- 

R: Yeah, but they were trying. It was such a Dr. Berlootz. 
S: [indecipherable] Dr. Berlootz, 
what can he do?  What could he
 do?  Give me  [indecipherable] 
R: Yes, but he tried, okay, 
okay, but he dr -- tried. 
S: Yeah. 
R: Your -- of course your body was th-the ma in -- 

S: Yeah, the ma in [ind
ecipherable] was my body. 
R: -- but -- but people were trying. 

S: Yeah. And the doctor told my husband -- he 
wa s not the husband yet, my boyfriend. Don™t 
ma rry her. She™ll not able to have children, she™
ll not able to work, she 
is like a glass, you have 
to keep her very carefully whol
e life. And you can fell ill because 
the illness is such that you can 
get it from her. So it [indecipherable] loved -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
11 
 
R: I was sleeping with her in one bed for weeks. I 
wasn™t afraid. I never catch anything from her.  
S: I was holding the bad things for myself. I didn
™t give it not to her and not to my husband. 
R: Not to the children. 
S: Not to the children, thank God. 

Q: Luta, you were very strong willed. 

S: I don™t know. 

R: Yes. 

Q: That™s how you described yourself, or -- or  it seems that you had a strong will, to me , when I 

hear some  of the stories that you tell. What 
ma de you listen to Rachel?  Because some times you 
did. 

S: I did all the time. Now I am not listening to he
r. I did. No, look, she was older as I am, and she 
was -- I know that she wa s very friendly to me , she -- and -- 

R: The war did that. 
S: The war did, yeah, and then what -- what -- 
what she told me was right. We didn™t discuss 
such things like political things
 or some thing very big and very
 clever, but day to day things, 
thought she knew better than I. What can I -- what can a 15 - 16 - 17 y
ears old teenager know 
about life?  She used to grab me  -- 
R: But you were -- you were [indecipherable] 

S: -- to her, and to cover my eyes not to s
ee how -- how wome n were raped. She covered my 
eyes, she didn™t let me  see a lot of things.  

Q: But who covered your eyes? 

R: Nobody. No [indecipherable] cover your eyes.  

Q: A-And you have kept this connection -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
12 
 
S: Yeah. 
Q: -- all these years. 

S: Yeah. 

R: Yes. 

Q: Can you just talk alittle bit 
about that? 
S: [indecipherable] 

R: No. It™s hard to explain how it come , but I -- but 
I felt a fr iend in her, in spite of the -- th-the -- 
that I was very devoted to the whole fa mily, I 
felt a friend, and I like her, and I can™t tell you 
why. Even now I can™t know w
hy I like her, but I like her. 
S: No, it™s a -- she™ ll -- related like 
sisters, that is the proper -- 
R: But you felt like sister. 

S: Like a -- like a family. 

R: And -- and I am -- I like very mu
ch her children, they were devoted. 
S: And they like her.  

R: Yeah. 

S: Yeah, and they -- 

R: And my children like her. Even my grandchi
ldren. I told you my gra
nddaughter said that we 
have to ma ke a gathering -- 

S: A fa mily gathering. 

R: -- fr om the fa mily, and Luta with her children will come. 

S: Ha -- have to come . They have to come . 

R: [indecipherable] I said yes, the whole family. 

S: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
13 
 
R: That™s it. [indecipherable] 
S: I don™t know, I think it™s not so 
rare, it™s not so [indecipherable] 
R: It™s not a thing that so
me body can tell you, or it™s -- 
just come s from the heart. 
S: Yes, it™s very natural. 

R: Ha -- yeah, it™s hard to explain. 

Q: Is there anything else e
ither of you want to add? 
R: I don™t think so.  

Q: I did ju -- 

R: I -- I want her to be h
ealthy and good, and be -- I want
 her to be all her life.  
S: I am. 

Q: I did want to ask, because this has been a bit of a theme. Both of you me ntioned that you 

hadn™t talked in a lot of detail
 to your children. A- And I think you Luta said that -- that you 
hadn't really shared the story with hardly 
anybody. What ma de you decide to -- to do it now?  
What were your thoughts about it? 

S: I think that Rachel told me
 about it, and she told me , can we come  together?  And I thought 
that -- that no, we ar
e not young already and it come s a time wh
en ma ybe we have to do it, like 
obligation, not like a -- a goodwill, but obligation. 
Maybe to leave it for my children, if not for 
the hist ory, is for my children, because  my son 
is pushing me all the time, but he is not pushing 
me  all the time  to -- to write about the Holocaust
 time, but about the family, what -- he doesn™t 
know the family of cour se, because they -- he di dn™t know his grandparents and so I thought, 

ma ybe it™s time , and bec a use she is going, so I™ll go with her. 

R: So we we nt together. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
14 
 
S: Which will be like, easier for me. That™s it. So the time came and I™m here, and describe the -- 
a part of -- of this -- of -- 
it™s a part of the life we had, it
™s not everything what -- you cannot 
describe every detail, because the days were fu
ll with dangerous details 
and it™s -- it™s -- it™s 
amazing that we survived, you know, it -- I don™t know
 how it was, like -- every step our -- every 
step, every day, was ma ybe the last step. Every tim
e we went to appelle st -- to stay on the -- on 
the appelle, we had to think what is the last , if
 [indecipherable] last, th
ey will choose us to the 
crematorium or not?  So, it was like that.  

R: As I told you Kathy, that the life of
 every survivor is an accident.  

S: Yeah, it™s up to [indecipherable] 

R: They can be taken to the oven -- 

S: They could. 

R: -- as easily as another one. As I told 
you, the Yom Kippur action, how close we was -- 
S: Yeah. 
R: -- to death. And there were hundreds of situations. 
S: Hundreds, thousands, yeah. So, it™s accide nt. 

R: We  could catch -- we
 could catch typhus -- 
S: Typhus, yeah. 

R: -- very easily. 

S: Oh. 

R: We  were surrounded, around, around w
ith people that were very -- 
S: [indecipherable] one -- 

R: Yeah. 

S: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401  
15 
 
R: So it™s a --  
S:  It ™s t h e fat e . 

R: Here we are. 

S: Yeah, it™s a fate.  

R: [indecipherable] old age. 

S: If you believe in fate, that™s it.  

R: And I want to tell you that I was thinking about 
to come , and we were -- I al -- an interview, 
and always I was pushing it away. And now -- 

S: [inaudible] 

R: -- I have a feeling that 
it™s out of my shoulders. 
S: Yeah. 

R: That I did it, and I left
 some thing for the history.  
S: I didn't think about
 it, but I did it -- 
R: And that was -- 
S: I didn™t think about it. I th -- 

R: -- I was thinking that -- 

S: -- I thought that I™ll not do it.
 I don™t have to do it. Why I have to do it? Why I have to go 
through that?  And it was a -- 

R: But now we are -- 

S: Yeah. 

R: -- okay. We did it. Le t people know. 

Q: Thank you very much. 

R: You™re welcome. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0401

S: Only we didn™t pay them off. That what I wanted. I want to tell you th
at after the liberation, I 
was very sick, that why. But my dream was to 
belong t -- to a organiza
tion, to a terrorist 
organization. And to go from home  to home  to fi
nd out the people who did it for us, and to kill 
them on the spot. Not a trial, that  they didn't tria
l us. So, that™s it. But I wa s sick, and my -- my 
husband quiet me  down after that. So me times I™m
 thinking that what we should do because 
thousands of them are having a good life after that. 
And saying that it™s -- it wasn™t a Holocaust. 
Do you know how painful it is?  If
 you survived all the things, 
horrible things, and lost your 
whole fa mily, and all people are oh, and say Je
ws are imagining some thing like that -- 
R: They™re ma king it up. 

S: -- they™re ma king it up, and th 
-- the -- because they wanted 
to take money from Germany. 
And Ger ma ny is such a poor country, they woul
d give it for nothing, the money for -- to the 
Jews. Germany knows exactly what -- what it was, 
what they did to us. It™s a -- how many people 
were sentenced?  We re sentenced for life, or sent
enced to death?  You can count it on the finger. 
And the pictures we have, you know, in the mu
seum, how the Germans are holding the pistol, 
why they made the pictures of that? It mean
s you like it?  What kind of person are you if you like 
to kill others?  Kill people what you don™t 
know, you have no idea whom you are killing, why 
you are killing?  I understand that soldiers are 
fighting. They are fighti
ng. Two countries are 
fighting and if you don™t kill them, 
they will kill you, yeah. It™s not good, very bad, but that™s it. 
But here, civilian wome n, children, old -- old 
-- old people. Men wit
hout -- without weapons, 
what -- who cannot do any harm to you?  How could you sleep after that?  It means you are not a 
huma n being and you have to be killed. I wouldn
™t -- and here the murderers now, I wouldn™t 

take them to prison and then we are paying for th
em to -- to keep them in the prison. They are 
paying the taxes because they -- they have a 
good life in the prison. If you murdered some body,

you have to be murdered, you have to be kille
d. There is no other way. That™s my opinion, of 
course.  
R: [indecipherable] are worse than the other way. 

S: Yeah, so [indecipherable] of
 course. And that what it --  
R: What was the -- 

S: -- ma kes me  sick that I never did anything to 
pay off for my fat h er or

R: You will never be able to do it. 

S: No, of course not. 

R: Otherwise the whole -- 

S: Now I am --  

R: -- world would be destroyed. 

S: Now I a m not -- not able to do it. I -- I don™t 
know if I would be able to do it before, but I 
wanted it. Now, somebody ask me not long ago, w
ould you be able to kill?  Wa  -- what -- if you 
know?  But no -- 

R: No. 

S: -- I wouldn™t be able to kill. But I hate 
it. And that™s it, what I wanted to tell you. 
R: But now is another gene
ration, another people -- 
S: Yeah, no, not the young people, not -- oh not th
e innocent, not Germans is Germans, no. Only 
the people, if I knew exactly, that they 
were the murderers. That they m -- 
R: But you will never be able to find them. 

S: No, now I-I don™t th-think 
about -- talk about now. 
R: And even before.

S: Before we could, before we could. 
R: How long -- how long did 
it take to find Eichma nn?  
S: Oh, because nobody looked for him so much. He 
was only -- he was even a -- he  didn't change 
the name  even.  

R: Do you reme mber that it was a trial?  We  had to go to the trial -- 

S: Actually --  

R: -- from Mora. 

S: -- we -- to Mora -- from Mora. Mora was th
e hangman of the Wilna gh
etto. Of the ghetto in 
Wilna. But then, after the liquidation of the 
Wilna ghetto, he went to Poland, and he was a 
hangman of the Poles. So the Poles wanted hi
m very much, but he was caught by the Russians, 
and he had the trial in Wilna. A
nd then the -- it was not the deat
h penalty in Wilna, in -- in 
Russia, so they -- they sentenced hi m for life, and 
he was in Siberia, yeah. Then Stalin died and 
Khrushchev came to power. I don™t know why he
 decided, probably ha -- asked for some  
prisoners of war, Soviet prisoners
 of war from Austria, he was from Austria. So he -- he was 
talking to them and they asked, give us our pr
isoners [indecipherable] yeah, and he gave it to 
Mora. And here -- they promised that they will sent
ence him also, that his -- 
it will be a trial in --  
in -- in Vienna, or in hi s place where he was bor
n. So you know, there are still witnesses alive. 
They came from Israel, and it was a trial. And he
 was sitting and his s
ons were sitting and 
laughing at the witnesses. One wa -- it was a horribl
e trial. It was a trial over the witnesses, not 
over him. And he was fr ee. Then they decided he 
ne -- in a [indecipherabl e] that they will have -- 
find other witnesses that came to Wilna and we had 
to be the witnesses. Oh, but then he took a -- 
a document from the doctor that he is very sick, 
and the trial never -- he died. He was even the 
ma yor in the city, he was -- he lived on -- in. That™s it.

Q: What was his name? 
S: Mora. 

Q: His first name ?  

S: I don™t know, fr -- Hans, or 
fr -- I don™t know, I don™t remember. 
R: [indecipherable] 

S: He was such a horrible ma n. If you -- 
he find you on his way, he will shit --  
R: Shot. 

S: -- he will shot you -- he will 
shoot you without regret. Anything. 
R: It was the horror of the ghe
tto if he would standing -- 
S: And the Poles wanted him [indecipherable] 
and the Poles -- the Polish people had the death 

penalty. They would hung him, one, two, three. That 
what they did to every such a mu rderer they 

found.  

R: You know, and he growed up three sons, very 
educated, very strong, and this came an old Jew 
who even can™t talk right, you know -- 
S: Yeah. [indecipherable] 

R: -- and he is a witness. 

S: They were whispering, they 
were laughing, and it was horrible. 
R: But that™s what it is. 

S: That™s it. 

R: They destroyed the best. 

S: Yeah, the best they destroyed. The culture, th
e Jewish cultur e of east 
Europe didn™t -- didn™t 
come  back. They destroyed. Of course some  pe
ople, as we survived, and we produced other 

people, yeah. But the culture, gone. Everything is gone.

R: And the best people who can 
stand up for the [indecipherable] 
S: Yeah. Oh yeah. [indecipherable] 
R: You know?  So, anyway, you will not change  the world. 

S: No. 

R: You read not so long 
the book about Indians.  
S: Mm-h m. 

R: You see what™s doing?  Yeah, yeah.  

S: What will go -- 
Yugoslavia, yeah. 
R: So, what are you looking for?  Yugoslavia -- 

S: Israel. 

R: Yeah. But you can™t compare to the Jewish trag
edy, because there were tragedies a lot, very 
big and horrible tragedies.  

S: You don™t have to compare. Let it go. 
R: Yes. But this is a tragedy that™s -- 
S: Nothing have to [indecipherable] 

R: -- nobody can, or could 
escape. Escape only -- 
S: Wa s enough deaths in Yugoslavia also.  

R: -- only escape the people who were hiding an
d they didn™t find them
. Who were not shot 
because the last time they have a rule not to sh
ot, which people have to die from the sicknesses. 
And that™s it. No other way to 
survive. No richness, no educati
on, nothing helped to survive a 
person. And it™s -- 

S: Okay, it™s enough. 

R: Thank you.
