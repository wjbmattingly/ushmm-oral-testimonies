Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with
 
Annette Fein
, conducted by 
Ina Navazelski s
, on Novemb er 7
th
, 2008, in 
Alexandria, Virgin ia. 
Thank you, 
Annette
, for agreeing to talk with us today. As Œ 
as you know, we are interested
 in recording the stories of people who experienced 
and survived the Holocaust.
 And since we are here 
at the child survivor™s 
conference, we are very gratef
ul that you™ve agreed to te
ll Œ to talk to us. Can you 
give me a little bit of bac
kground about your s Œ your whole Œ your story; where Œ 
where you were born; where your family 
came from? And we™ll start from th ere. 
Answer: Okay. My 
family came from
 Poland. 
I don™t remember the exact location, 
but my  brother 
Jack 
would be ab le to tell you. And th ey moved to Œ to 
Paris,
 where 
I was born. 
Q: When ? 
A: In Œ I-I was born in 1940, so I assume 
like a year or so before, maybe two years 
before, because 
Jack 
was also born in 
Paris.
 And then , by th e age of around two, 
we were put in hiding in  a place called
 Vales
(ph)
 Gala nt
(ph), and I have abso lu tely 
no memory of that time. And after I th
ink about Œ well, I 
guess around 1945, we 
were brought by relatives to an orphanage
. I just today learned that we were in 
several places, but I only know of one place, 
Taverne
, an orphanage in 
Taverne,
 a 
Jewish orphanage, wher
e I was until the age of 
[indecipherable]
 until 1948, when Œ

where I then was adopted by American 
citizens, who were bo-both born in 
Russia
, 
but they were both Œ they were both alre
ady American citizens, and we Œ I believe 
that happened in 1947, and 
it took about a year for the wh
ole process to be finished, 
and I moved to 
America
 at the age of eight, 1948. 
Q: Do you Œ do you know anyt
hing ab out your birth parents? 
A: Well, we have photographs of them, 
and I know th at they were both sew Œ 
tailors. I have photographs, but I Œ I dil 
Œ I don™t remember them. I rem Œ it™s all 
blocked out, basically, the whole time. I don™
t know ti Œ a-anything, except wh at Œ 
Q: Do you know their names? 
A: 
Calp eak
(ph). 
Rose
 and 
Joseph Calpeak
(ph). 
Q: And do you Œ do you know 
Œ did they  have any relative
s that you were ever able 
to identify? 

A: Not th at we™ve been  Œ yes, well, we 
had a Œ my  father had a sister who also 
perished Œ or it was my mother, I think it wa
s my mother™s sist Œ sister. You™ll have 
Œ I Œ I can™t Œ I have to verify, I Œ I Œ I 
don™t remember all these things, I forget 

them. I mean, I Œ I put them out of my mi
nd, pretty mu ch. They Œ and th ere was Œ 
there was another relation o Œ th-that Œ the da
ughters Œ the Œ the sister™s daughter is 
still alive Œ is alive in Œ in 
Paris
. We™re in contact with. And there™s another cousin 
also in 
Paris
.

Q: So would this suggest th
at when your family left 
Poland
, it wasn™t just your 
immediate family, your father and your 
mother, but a larger group of people? 
A: Perhap s, perhaps, but I have no Œ no id ea.
 I t Œ I have never really delved into the 
details of that. I know the fa Œ th
-the minimal facts, and that™s Œ 
Q: Have you been  happy know
ing just the minimal facts? 
A: It™s been Œ 

Q: Maybe happy isn™t the right wo rd, but Œ 
A: Well, yeah, no, I do Œ I don™t think it is
 the right word. For 
me it™s been Œ i-it™s 
something that was, and I accepted, and I do
n™t feel that I can just delve on it all the 
time. Or ev en to know if it Œ I don™t belie
ve that it can help me personally in  my  

life, so I just don™t bother. I do Œ I go fo rward, not back wards. 
Q: Do you know wh at happened , though, 
to your parents specifically ? Were you 
able to learn that? 

A: That, yes. We Œ basically. I know th at my
 father was put in a camp  mu ch earlier, 
I don™t remember the name. It™s not that I don™t know it, I don™t remember. A nd my 

mother, evidently Œ I 
keep hearing stories that she 
would cu Œ she had put us in 
hiding, in this village called 
Vales
(ph) 
Ga lan t
(ph), and she lived th
ere as well, with 
the family and eviden
tly there were other children 
there. And she went back to 
Paris,
 I Œ I believe and got caught and then  sent to a camp.

Q: But you don™t know whi Œ where Œ  
A: Again, I don™t remember. It™s o v er and 
down, I just don™t remember these names, 
because they Œ th
ey™re long and complicated things. 
Q: So you don™t Œ yeah, bu
t you know, you Œ they™re no
t recognizable, you don™t 
know that it would have been 
Auschwit z
 she was sent to Œ 
A: No, it™s not 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Okay. Okay. What™s your 
[indecipherable]
 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 mental, it™s a mental block, so
 Œ which I Œ I accept that it™s 
there, and I Œ it doesn™t bother me too mu ch, so Œ 

Q: Well, you know, who™s to Œ who is an
ybody else to say how another person 
should deal with 
Œ with their stories and their lives? 
A: Hm, right, right, mm-hm. 

Q: Do Œ do you have an
 earliest memo ry in your mind, of anything? 
A: None, no. The only Œ I-I used to Œ I 
used to have a memory or Œ or Œ of 
something like a place with a lot of trees,
 and we Œ I remember
 something Œ hearing 
Œ hearing people or ch ildren say somethingabout Jews, and I never knew wh at that 

was about until I moved to 
Israel
, and I wo uld Œ any time I met French people, I 
would ask th em if Œ because I only rememb er
 the tap Œ or the name, at that time,
 
Taverne,
 the Œ the pla Œ the Œ where the orph
anag e was. And, I would Œ any time I

would meet French people, I would ask th
em if they knew of the place. And it 
happens that Œ actually the first job I had in 
Israel
 was with an arch itect, and one of 
the partners was an interior decorator, Fr
ench man, and he Œ he tur Œ his name was 
Josh Goldsta Œ 
is 
Josh Goldstein
. And he said yes, of cour Œ he of Œ he knows the 
place, and it turns out that he and his wife 
both worked at this orphanage, but once Œ 
after we™d already left there.  
Q: So, would Œ 
A: And so he described the Œ th e setting, 
and that kind of made mo re sense, why 
that was stuck in my  head, of the trees, and Œ 
Q: So, until you had that c
onversation with  him, did you 
know that this is Œ you Œ 
could you place it in a town o 
Œ when you had this image 
of trees, or you didn™t 
even know where that was? 

A: No, I didn't know where it was. I didn™t know wh ere it was, because I never Œ 

Q: Okay. It was putting two and two together. 
A: Yeah, I never came across anyone Œ cause
 I Œ when  Œ when ever I would ask if 
they kn Œ i-it only started in Œ in
 Israel
 when I asked people where 
Taverne
 was. 
And Œ 
Q: What was your first language that you spoke? 
A: French. 

 
Interview with Annette Fein

Q: French. 
A: French. 

Q: And was Œ how long was that the only language that you spoke?  
A: Until the age of eight, and once we moved to
 America
, I think within about two 
months we learned English. 
I learned English perh aps fast
er than my  brother. And, 
in fact I got very low grades in French 
when  I studied, because I used to talk in 
class. So Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ I™ve put that Œ I™ve also blocked that out
, I mean, I Œ I know that, I Œ I accept it, 
I Œ now, i-if I absolutely have to  talk
 French , I might understand some. I understand 
a bit. But I don™t Œ I mean
, I Œ in Œ in fact, in 
Israel, 
in 
Mitzpe Ramon 
there are a 
lot of French  people, and I find the Fren
ch very snobby ab out the language, so I 
don™t Œ I say, okay, I don™t talk French. Bu t 
[indeciphera ble]
 I can understand a 
little, becau se I studied a bit, ri
ght? When I wa Œ when I™m in 
France
, I Œ the few 
times that I was in 
France
, I was able to talk to peop
le in the street, but not to 
people that I know. Mental Œ good mental block. But Œ 

Q: Why do you think th at
 mental block™s there? 
A: Probably there are things that I don™
t want to remember, I mean, that™s quite 
clear, you know. Ok ay.

Q: But it™s interesting, you know, when on
e has a mental block, when  I think about 
it in my own life, there are har Œ there ar
e some Œ there are some parts that have 
been hard, and if someone were to ask me 
to reconstruct them, 
it would not be easy. 
I reme mb er that they existed. I rememb e
r, let™s say, a basic story about them, but 
not necessarily a specific within
 it, or certainly not a time
line. But I know that they 
were there, you know, I Œ I 
was conscious when these events happened. And that™s 
what™s surprising for me is, when you™re 
not conscious, you don™t Œ you just don™t 
reme mb er s o meth ing .  T h en  
the question is Œ is, is th
ere a reason why you have no 
curiosity about it, or do you think 
you have no curiosity about it?  
A: I™ve kind of never went too deeply into
 it because I just like my life, and I Œ I 
said, this is what happen
ed, and I Œ you don™t go ba
ck. You don™t go back. You 
cannot solve Œ you™re right, you can find out,
 yes, your roots, and Œ and things like 
that, but I™m sure like there are reasons w
hy I-I Œ I do Œ I do a lot of sewing so I can 
say, oh yeah, well, my  parents were also Œ 
Q: In that profession. 
A: Œ tailors, in that profession. I do a lot 
of Œ I Œ I do artw ork. I don™t know whether 
there™s a connection there. But to me that™s
 just to go Œ you can™t go backward s, you 
can only go forwards
. So that™s why I don™t Œ I don™t s Œ

Q: So, isn™t it difficult sometimes, being w
ith people who Œ who 
have another need, 
the Œ the need to go
 backwards? How do 
you Œ how does that Œ 
A: That™s 
[indecipherable]
 had become difficult for me
, that difficult perhaps for 
them, but not for Œ I don™t find it Œ that 
it™s difficult for me. I look at it, you know, it 
Œ these are facts that y ou can™t change, and 
I don™t Œ I don™t feel that knowing mo re 
about it Œ I learned now from Œ from my 
brother, who seems to know mu ch Œ so 
much more. But he™s a Œ for instance, he do
esn™t remember me as p art of Œ in his Œ 
in his life, and I don™t remember h im in that wa Œ 

Q: In that early life in 
France
? 
A: Œ in Œ yeah. So th ere™s Œ 
Q: That was going to be one of my  questions. 
A: Yeah, so it™s Œ it™s Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ I mean, that™s a Œ I say, okay, I mean, I™ve totally blocked it out, but Œ and he 
hasn™t, but there™s still a lot of
 things that he also doesn ™t 
Œ hasn™t been able to relate 
to or to see clearly, or to understand clearly. And ag ain, that for some  Œ maybe 
because I live in 
Israel
, and that™s Œ it™s a Œ my life is Œ is my life as it is, and 
without complications of 
my past. For me, I mean.

Q: When you got Œ what I guess I™d like to  try and trace is, when you got to the 
United States, 
or even if it was earlier, even thou
gh you were a child, a young child 
earlier, do you remember conversations
 coming up, about 
the war, about the 
Holocaust, abou
t murders? 
A: No. 

Q: Did your paren Œ your ad opted 
parents, what were they like? 
A: Oh, they were very good 
people, very nice people, very giving. I don™t rememb er 
too much, if they talked ve
ry  mu ch about the war, but was Œ it was always a Œ it was 
not like Œ it wasn™t a hidden fact that we 
were adopted, we were Œ it was something 

that we were Œ we knew about. It wasn™t
 sudden Œ suddenly we learned that we 
were adopted, and where we came from. Bu
t I Œ I think I just kind of like, you 
know, fit in as quickly as possible. Like fo
r instance, learning English. I Œ I believe 
that within about two months I was ta
lking English, I was fluent in it. 
Q: And do you have me
mo ries of your brother being 
ab le to, or having Œ struggling 
with that? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Okay . Ho w did your adoptive parent
s cross your path? Do  you reme mb er Œ 
A: How did they what? 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
12
Q: How did they cross your path ? Do yo
u have me mo ries of the first time you met 
them? 
A: No. Only  thro ugh what th
ey  once Œ wh at they Œ my  father told me Œ both of 
them, that when they 
came to the orphanage Œ they came 
to visit your Œ in yo Œ they 
came to 
Europe
 and my father, who was very Œ an 
ardent Zionist, decided th at the 
best way to find out what the situati
on was, was by going to  an Œ a Jewish 
orphanage, and that™s how he Œ I-I don™t 
know exactly what the procedure was, but 
that™s how he came to that orphanage, and 
he always said that he Œ he saw me, and 
decided because they didn™t have children of
 their own, he decided to ad Œ to  adopt 
me. And my  mo ther at the time didn™t want Œ my  adopted mo ther didn™t want 
anything to do with it, because she was not fe
eling well at Œ at that Œ this was in ™47. 
And Œ but he Œ it was his decision, basically
, and they said there™s also a brother. 
[indecipherable]
 said, okay, we™ll take both of them. But I don™t rememb er the 
situation, I don™t in Œ in  any way. 

Q: Aside from the trees, what would be ot
her early me mo ries that you can recall? 
A: Only  Œ yes Œ 

Q: It doesn™t have to be Holocaust related,
 they could be about 
anything, just Œ just 
Œ wh at Œ wh at Œ wh at comes to your mind? 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
13
A: Ah, th ere was Œ okay, there was one Œ 
as I said before, there was Œ hearing 
children yell out something about Jews. 
Q: Was it a mean yelling out? 
A: Maybe Œ yeah , I think so. And, again this 
Œ this interior decora
tor said to me that 
we went to school, evidently, and in orde
r to go to school, we left th e orphanage 
and passed a Catholic school. So , perhap s that
 kind of Œ so, for Œ at that point, that 
explained to me why I reme mb er something 
like that. The details, n o thing at all, 
right. And th ere was one other thing of some one Œ and again, I™ve never delved into 

it, because it™s Œ I don™t think it™s a pleasan
t thing to remember, about Œ something 
about a tree, and a Œ interestingly enough, 
I had a time when I di Œ I would paint a 
lot of trees. And someone onc
e decided that it wou Œ it showed th at I Œ my  Œ I 
hadn™t Œ that I didn™t have roots, and th at
 was why I was drawing trees. And I said, 

fine, that™s, you know, pretty clear, and und
erstandable. But there was one thing that 
there was a mat Œ someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name  
called zoo or 
zo e 
or something like that. And this 
could have been a dream, or it 
could have been something in detail, that
 someone was hanging from a tree, that™s 
all I remember. I mean, that™s Œ it was neve
r made Œ never clear, 
and I really don™t Œ 
I™m not all that interested 
to know too much
 about that. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Was it a  shadow? 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
14
A: A shadow, or Œ 
Q: A shadow of a person on that tree, was it Œ or Œ 

A: I can™t even say. Just someone hangin
g on a tree, or hanging on a tree. Like a Œ 
Q: Yeah. It doesn ™t bring Œ it doesn ™t brin
g up a Œ a Œ a pleasant image wh atso Œ at 
all. 

A: No, no, no. So, I put it out Œ I mean, I 
Œ it was there. When
 I was much younger, 
it would Œ it would Œ I woul
d th ink about it now and th en, but I Œ I pushed it out, 
and Œ 

Q: Did you feel different than other children in the 
United Sta tes? 
A: I think only in the Œ well,
 that™s Œ I think that™s why I se Œ I learned English very 
quick ly, because kids in the s Œ in
 the neighborhood would call me 
F renchie
, and I 
decided I didn™t Œ I wanted 
to be American, again, as quickly as I could.  
Q: And did you feel differe
nt than other children because you were adopted, an d 
you knew you were adopted ? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er that feeling. Ma
ybe in the first few months, or the first 
year, because we did go to a private school 
for one year. And then , when  we went to 
grammar school, we would put Œ we were
 put back a year. And I never made up 

that year, whereas 
Jack
 did, because it wasn™t Œ becau
se I™d become friends with Œ

with kids that were 
Œ 
I was with, so, it was enough, I-I 
didn™t need to go Œ go ahead 
one year. So no, I don™t 
think I felt too different. 
Q: Can you describe to me
 a little bit about Œ 
I mean, I don™t know how to ex press 
this in a way that doesn™t sound
 mu ch too Œ too many big word s. 
A: Mm. 
Q: But how does Œ how did you 
form your Œ I mean, mo st 
of the time children form 
their identity from all of thes
e building blocks that are part of their past. That 
doesn ™t necessarily mean they 
stay there, but that™s what they have to start with. 
They  have this build ing block, this one, th
is one, this one, and then later they can 
say, well, I want part of this one, I want pa
rt of that one, I don™t want the rest. And 
little by little they start form
ing their identity. What fo
rmed yours? How did you 
form yours? What things did you 
choose to become who you are? 
A: I think I was very influenced by the Œ by
 the Israeli Œ I think 
also Œ okay, we™re Œ 
when I came to
 America
, I remember my father would 
Œ used to  make records of 
us, he Œ he liked to sing and we Œ he ma
de records of Œ of us talking in Œ and I 

reme mb er one of the Œ even  Œ no, even be
fore I spoke English, I mensh Œ I thi Œ 
from the orphanage, we were ma Œ we
 were oriented to think about 
Israel
, and I 
think that that was like Œ that was always
 my Œ my direction, is to come to 
Isr ael
, 
which I did, very Œ as soon as
 I-I finished at th Œ sorry. 
When I ca Œ when I Œ in one

of the tapes that we made, I sa
id that I wanted to come to 
Palestine
. And this was 
like very early in Œ in the 
process. So I think th at was always what pushed  me 
along. And because my parents, especi
ally my father, was so much into 
Israel
 
himself, it always Œ 
Q: It was natural. 

A: It was very natural. And I beca
me involved in youth groups, Young 
Judaea
, as 
in high school, befo re high school, 
you know, in high school at least Œ 
Q: Where did you grow up 
here? What Œ what si Œ  
A: In 
Union
 Œ well, we started out in 
Newark, New Jersey,
 and then in 
Union, 
New Jersey. 
And in Œ when I was in my last year, 
or my la Œ no, I think in my se Œ 
or junior Œ between my  junior
 and senior year of high 
school, I came Œ I went to 
Israel
 with Young 
J uda ea
. 
Q: That was the first time? 

A: That was the first time. And afterwards
 I said I was moving Œ I was coming back 
to 
Israel.
 And, in fact, in my  year book it 
says I™m known for wanting to  go to 
Israel
. So, I Œ I was ac Œ active in young Judea,
 wa Œ I decided to 
go to u Œ I went to 
university for Œ first, and Œ because my
 parents had said, 
you know, finish 
university, and then  do whatev
er you want. And I realized
 that was a good a Œ good

Q: Where did you go to school? 
A: 
Temple
 University. Studied art, fine arts, a
nd art education. And I finished and I 
went to 
Israel
 for a year, and I™m now Œ that was 
in ™63, and I™m still living there, 
so Œ 

Q: And does Œ is 
Œ 
is 
Israel
 more home than the 
United States 
ever was? 
A: 
Israel
 is home. I don™t Œ I can™t say more home, because I feel very much at 
home in Œ in  
America
 because I grew up here. Yet, not 
here in this area, but in Œ in 
Jersey 
for instance, there™s no more a Œ 
when my parents were alive, 
New Jersey
 
felt very much part of me, and it was Œ it™s 
always easier Œ easy for me to come to 
America
, because I love it, right, I speak Eng
lish, and there™s no problem there, so 
Œ and I Œ I like some of the things that I see in
 America
, but oh, you, the sun is in 
your eyes. Do you want to m
ove? Do you edit afterwards? 
Q: I stopped it, right now. 

A: Okay, yeah. 
Q: I paused it. Or, put it this way, I paused
 it, and we™ll just move to these chairs 
here.  
A: Yeah.  
Q: Oops. Well, put it this way, 
I™ll move to this chair here.

Q: And you don™t have to. 
A: I™m okay. 

Q: Yeah. If you™re fine, then Œ 
then we can stay that way. 
A: Okay. Now I™m Œ  

Q: Okay. Here we go. I was hoping the su
n was going to go in  the other direction. 
So, record, okay. So, you were saying that 
Israel
 is home, but you felt at home here 
as well, having grown up here. 
A: Yes, yes, it™s Œ  
Q: So how did Œ how did th
ese other parts of that early life that you don™t 
reme mb er, that Œ that was blocked out, at 
what point did they come in Œ at wh at 
point would you be reminded, 
or would so me pe Œ point, some piece of information 

come up? Do you have Œ 

A: Only when I come here and Œ no, basi
cally only wh en I come here and I hear 
about things that my brot
her knows about and reads ab Œ o-or has been involved 
with. So, it™s all. I was part of that too, bu
t that™s as far as it goes, because I go back 
home and Œ and Œ home to
 Israel
, and get into my  work  and Œ 

Q: And your Œ your parents from 
Poland
 came to
 France
, your brother wasn™t that 
much older than you were. 

A: Two years older.

Q: Two years older. But did he
 have any direct memo ries 
of them, that he would tell 
you, or that he would share with
 you, as you were kids still? 
A: No, no. I Œ he may have ha
d, yes, but we were not close to Œ we didn™t Œ I do Œ 
we Œ for instance, we Œ we lived in
 Newark
, we went to grammar school, but then 
we moved to 
Union
, and he was already in hi
gh school, but Œ and still in 
Newark
, 
and I Œ when  we moved to 
Union
, I started high school in 
Union
, some Œ our paths 
wa-wa-was like, you know, I didn™t know hi
s friends, because he was in a different 
high school. So we were very much apart, 
and then he went off 
to college, and I was 
still in high school, and we were ve
ry, very  much apart, I think. 
Q: Well, you had Œ when Œ 
if you were eight years ol
d wh en you came to the 
United States
, and let™s say normally it Œ you know,
 a teenager finishes high school 
at 17, you had less than a decade where yo
u were living together. A decade is still a 
decade, but Œ 
A: Yeah, but not Œ no, really Œ 
Q: Not really, less. 
A: Œ there was too many ag a Œ 
because he went to a different high school, so our 
paths weren™t similar. I became very in
volved in Œ in you
th group in Young
 
Judaea
, he didn™t want Œ it didn™t happen with
 him. I went to overnight camps, I 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
20
don™t think he did. Well, maybe
 he did one time. I used to love to go, and he didn™t, 
as far as I k n ow. 
Q: Can you tell me what those camps gave you? 
A: He™s a math Œ he™s a mathematician, I™m
 into art. It™s like, you know, we™re two 
planets apart. I don™t Œ 
Q: Well, here™s an irony, without knowin
g Œ without knowing you at all, and not 

having talked to your brother, it sounds th at you were the person who certainly  
found an identity in being 
Jewish, and then looking to 
Israel
 as a place that would 
be for you, your direction,
 and he did not. And yet Œ 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Œ wh en you look at the Holo caust, a
nd looking at what were those early years 
that are so mu rky, you have less 
interest in it, and he has more. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And there™s a certain 
irony in th at, you know? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: In Œ 

A: I™m also  the only one in the w
hole family that Œ that moved to
 Israel
 and that 
became Œ that decided
 Israel 
was the place for me. Whic
h probably came from my 
adopted Œ well, no, I think that came 
way before, from the orphanage. Because 

 
Interview with Annette Fein

21
again, when I came I sa
id, I™m coming to Œ I wi Œ want to go to 
Palestine
. I was 
even, I think, kosher at th
e time, as I Œ I was very 
concerned ab out what I was 
eating when I first came to 
America
. 
Q: No teachers you remember fro
m the orphanage, or no Œ no Œ 
A: None. 
Q: Œ other individuals who cross your mind? 

A: No, nothing, nothing. 
Q: Well, it™s just unu Œ it™s unusual.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: That, even when I think 
in my  own life, again, I have some me mories of age 
three. 

A: And you™re younger, really, yeah. 

Q: A little, a little, but Œ but Œ 

A: No. 
Q: But I rememb er some Œ I don™t reme mb er 
mo re than an episode, but I rememb er 
the episode, and it Œ some kind of a context of
 that episode. And then there™s a next 
memo ry that could have been a year later, 
could have been a y
ear and a half later. 
But some Œ a little bit is Œ something is th
ere. And so that™s why when you see me 
perplexed, I am Œ I™m truly 
perp lexed, you know, of Œ 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
22
A: Because it™s never als Œ it™s never really 
bothered me that I don™t remember these 
things, because I™ve always believed for my
self that I™m Œ I can
™t relive my past, 
and it™s not going to change 
really, who I am, for me. 
I Œ I accept anyone who wants 
to delve into Œ into that, a
nd Œ an d to dig out th ings, a
nd Œ like, I™ll accept people 
that feel that if they go to psychiatric 
treatment, you know, and find out wh at their 
past was, and th ey Œ they 
Œ I accept that people need that, and somehow, for some 
reason Œ I don™t say I don™t need it, I just
 don™t Œ haven™t felt that I need to Œ to 

search that. Which is perhaps perplexing. 
Q: Well, it™s perplexing, but it™s also a choi
ce that no one else can say you should  or 
should not do, you know, it is
 Œ it is an each individual
 choice. It is Œ but these 
things that happen, in some way or anothe
r, they form our iden
tity. So what kind of 
a person do we become using 
those various pieces? And I think that that™s one of 
the Œ I think that™s one of the reasons wh
y people do go back into  that, they ta Œ 
they take something that they rememb ered
, or experienced, and it shaped th em, you 
know, and how did it shape them? And so 
that™s what, you know, sometimes w e Œ 

A: Well, I think Œ I think th at wa Œ wh at 
did shape me was the fact that we were Œ 
what I Œ I don™t remember deta
ils, but I know that I came to 
America
 with the idea 
that I was going to move to 
Palestine
.  
Q: And where from that Œ 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
23
A: So th at did shap e me. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And I don™t understand how it didn™t affect
 my  brother, but that™s because, again, 
when we Œ we™d been so different, and alwa
ys were very different. And that™s what 

Œ that™s what guided me. 

Q: Can you tell me, what did Œ and Œ and 
I say this from comp lete ignoran ce: I™m 
not Jewish, and I™ve not Œ not been  to
 Israel
, and I™d like to hear what about it 
spoke to you. What articulate
d in a certain way, and Œ 

A: At the time Œ look, I Œ again, I came the 
first time with a youth group. I was not a 
Œ I wa Œ hadn™t finished  high school yet, and 
it was very exciting, I remember this Œ 
also a very young country still. In ™50 Œ it 
was ™57 that I went, right, so it was only 
what, not even 10 years old. And it was Œ it wa
s just li Œ we traveled a lot, and is a Œ 

as a Œ as a young person ju st trave
ling like that, it just affected me.  
Q: It™s a lot of fun. 
A: And it was also a very free feel Œ a very
 Œ it™s not wh at it is today, right? It was 
very free, very easy, very warm. If you 
ask someone how to get someplace, they 
take you there at the time. It ma Œ  it may 
not happen to day, but 
there is an easiness 
about Israelis, a warmn ess like, ab out Israelis 
that Œ that really pulls you. And again, 
today it™s very different because it™s be
come much more Americanized as well

[indecipherable]
. And bigger. So , it™s not the same 
thing that it was when I first Œ 
when I first came to 
Israel
, and I was Œ excitedly, I mean, I Œ you know, oh, I™m 
gonna come back to 
Israel
, and I just did that, that™s all I did. 
Q: I belong. 
A: I Œ yeah. I didn™t have to iden tify as 
a Jew, I was a Jew. Everyone is a Jew, 
basically 
[indeciphera ble]
. You didn™t have to Œ I don™
t have to go to synagogue in 
order to prove that I™m Jewish. I don™t like re
ligion to start out with, so I don™t know 
when  Œ if that happened then, or now, 
but I™m very Œ I™m not anti-religious, but I 
don™t Œ I think religion is a very big problem 
in our world, so Œ bu
t, I mean, that™s Œ 
that™s now my  feelings today, after bei
ng the age that I am, and seeing what I Œ 
what I see, everything. But 
it always just felt very much
 at home. So I came back, 
after being two months with a bunch of 
kids, you know, and 
having a great time. 
And I was still belonging to Œ to Young
 J uda ea
 at the time, and I became a leader 
in the movement. And I got kick ed out becaus
e I would tell the truth. I li Œ I liked si 
Œ you know, I liked the facts to
 be clear. It wasn™t a great, easy place to be, and I™m 
Œ I would tell kids this, you know, that™s 
not good, you have to tell them to Œ you 
know, to come. And I don™t see the point in  doing that, so Œ 

Q: What was it that got you kicked  out? 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
25
A: Because I Œ I just never Œ I didn™t want to lie about what 
Israel
 was. It wasn™t an 
easy place to come to live in. It still isn™t an
 easy place to come to live in. And if 
you want Œ decide that you want to come, 
you ha Œ I think you have to be aware of 
that, and not what the Jewish agency w
ill tell you, because that™s a bunch of lies 
sometimes. 
Q: But you know, it™s pretty harsh to kick
 someone out who has such a passion for a 
place. 
A: No, it™s okay, it™s okay, because Œ 
Q: You got over it, huh? 

A: Œ I™d se Œ I Œ yeah , I Œ it didn™t bother me
. I mean, it was fa Œ it was funny to me, 
fine at the time, you know. It didn™t st
op me from doing what I wanted to do, was 
fine. I have Œ I™m going in my  direction. 
And that™s what I did, I mean, I finished 
university, I studied art and art education so 
th at I would have something to ba Œ to 

fall on if I needed it. 
Q: Did your parents support this? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: It sounds like they would have. 
A: Yes, yes. They  have Œ they Œ they ha
d no choice really, because my father was 
always 
Isr ael, Israel. 
And they  never Œ they  never con Œ came to live in
 Israel
 

 
Interview with Annette Fein

because my mother actually di
dn™t want to. My father wanted to come. He would Œ 
he, in fact, left 
Russia
 when  he was 14 Œ 
Q: 1905 - 1910 Œ 
A: Something like that. 
Q: Œ something like Œ 

A: And he came to 
Isr a el.
 
Q: To 
Palestine. 
A: To 
Palestine.
 And he stud Œ he studied in th Œ 
in school there for a couple years, 
until he got kicked out because
 he was illegally there. So 
in Œ and then he Œ he was 
kicked out and then
 he came back to
 Israel.
 And then eventually
, I think when he 
was 19, he wa Œ he came to 
America.
 So Œ 
Q: So you Œ d Œ wh at
 year was he born? 
A: Œ he was always Œ 

Q: What year was he born? 
A: He was born, I believe sometime early 1900s, I don™t reme mb er exactly Œ 
Q: So did Œ did you learn about his 
story and his family, and all of Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ where they came from in 
Russia
? 
A: Yeah, yeah, sure. I Œ

Q: Where were they from? 
A: 
Odessa. 
Q: Oh, near the 
Black Sea. 
And wh at propelled them out of there? 
A: Well, I don™t remember what 
[indecipherable] 

Q: It™s okay. 

A: It™s all there, it™s all there, but I just don™t remember 
[indeciphera ble]
 you 
know. 
Q: But did you Œ do you reme
mb er that he told you Œ 
was your mother also from 
Odessa
? You don™t know? 
A: No, no. She came Œ 
my  mo th er came to  
America
 very young, so she didn™t go 
through the same thing. And she was in Œ be
cause of her, he didn™t come back Œ he 
didn™t move to
 Israel
, because she didn™t want Œ 
her family was already in 
America
. His family was in 
Russia
, except for a brother, who ev entually mo ved to
 
America
, they were all in 
Russia. 
So they  would never Œ he never moved to
 Israel
, 
but we always had Israe
lis at our house. He spoke Hebrew fluently. 
Q: Oh, you did? 

A: He did. 
Q: He did? 
A: He did. 

 
Interview with Annette Fein

28
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I studied Hebrew in high school Œ in 
Œ in  Hebrew school, but I didn™t Œ I don™t 
think I could s-speak it until I came to
 Israel
 andwent to 
ulpan. 
Q: Mm-hm. What™s that? 

A: A Œ a place to 
learn only Hebrew. 
Q: What™s it called? 

A: It™s 
ulpan. 
Q: 
Oopa hn
(ph)? 
A: 
Ulpan
. 
Q: 
Ulpan. 
A: 
U-l-p-a-n. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: 
Ulpan. 
It™s like five days a week, six days a week. 
Q: Intensive? 
A: Five hours a day 
[indecipherable]
 I studied there when I first ca Œ I mean, I 
knew some Hebrew, but I don™t think I could really speak it. When I moved to 
Israel,
 the first thing I did was go to 
ulpan.
 The si Œ for f Œ I ended up Œ it™s usually 
six we Œ six months, and I went for five mo
nths, because I simp ly then got a job and 
I decided to Œ to take the job. Bu t I mean
, you know, that was always my  direction, 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
29
and that™s what I did. And it came from our 
home, so the fact that my  brother wa Œ I 
Œ it always also amazes me, and no one really
, in the family came 
to that decision to 
do th at. It was only me, which I 
[indeciphera ble]
 comes all back from
 France
, and 
that was Œ that was what pulled me 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It™s interesting, it™s interesting. What
™s the Œ wh en you Œ wh en you look at the 
American milieu, the American life, and 
I take that to be primarily Jewish 
American life, and you look at that sort 
of ethos and spirit and people there, and 
Israeli, could you expand a little bit on Œ 
on where you see the differences, where 
you see the similarities as far as Œ 
A: That™s very complicated. 
Q: I know. I know. 
A: Look, when I first came to 
Isra el,
 I found it very Œ I mean, it was very different. 
There was, again, in o Œ 

Q: Different than the 
United Sta tes 
you left, or different than now? 
A: Than the 
United States. 
Different then than the 
United States. 
Today it™s much 
more like Œ not like, but much
 more influenced by the 
United States.
  
Q: What were some of those differences? 

A: Okay. It™s a much warmer place, not just Œ not just physically, but people are 
very giving, very, very tough,
 but very soft inside. Like
 this Œ what they call the 

 
Interview with Annette Fein  
 
November 7, 2008 
 

 
 
30
sabra, which is the fruit of 
Israel
, and it™s prickly on the out
side, and soft and sweet 
on th e inside. And th is is what the sabra Œ 
that™s what an Israeli born person is like. 
And that™s, I think, probably  
one of the things that Œ that attracted me. There was Œ 
you didn™t have t Œ you know,
 you Œ you Œ you don™t have
 to make an appointment 
Œ you didn™t have to make appoin tments 
with people, you could ju st stop in and 
visit. Which you could Œ y
ou can™t do Œ couldn™t do in 
America
, and you still can™t 
do in 
America
. I reme mb er a few times some visits I would have to call up people 
and say oh, well, they have no time to see 
me. Yeah, I™m just here on a vacation, 
you know, you™re coming to 
visit, I mean, I™m not livin
g here any mo re. And that 
type of th ing is very like to Œ in  
Israel,
 even today, if I come ba Œ when I come 
back, I™ll call up and say I™m coming over, th
ere™s never Œ almo st never a problem 
with that. 
Q: I can tell you I miss that in the 
United States 
too. 
A: Yes, okay. 
Q: Of people just dropping by. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It used to be in another time and 
another place, but not necessarily here. 
A: At the time also, which isn™t happening
 Œ you can™t do now, because of the 
situation, you could get out on the road
 and hitchhike without any problem. You 

 
Interview with Annette Fein

31
could walk in almo st any neighborhood w
ithout any problem. Again, this is all 
changed, by little, by little, there Œ it™s not lik
e that every place. You don™t hitchhike 
so much today because of the Œ the 
situation. I unfortunately think that
 Israels
 Œ 
Israel
 has picked up on a lot of the bad thin gs about 
America
, rather than the good 
things. 
Q: Su Œ such as? 

A: I don™t know exactly wha-wh
at the good things are. An
 efficiency that Œ that™s 
here, that can be, I think, 
very helpful. I love going to
 supermarkets here, which I 
don™t love it Œ especially not where I live no
w. I love the fact th
at they™ll pack the 
things for you, where in 
Israel
 you have to do everything, except the 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: That™s very European, too. 

A: Yeah, okay, so Œ 

Q: In 
Europe
 it™s the same. 
A: Œ yeah, yeah, I know. Do
 Œ all the red tape that 
you sometimes have to go 
through just to Œ like, for in
stance, when I first came to
 Israel
, just to get a 
telephone, you would have to
 wait three years. Two, th
ree years. Which was good. 
It™s not like that today, but at the tim
e, you know, you say, wo w, look at Œ in

America
, within 24 hours you would have it, 
so Œ the Œ again, I me an, everything 
has become so Amer
icanized there. 
Q: So tell me about those things that ar
e American influences that you have more 
reservations about. 
A: Oh, th e whole Œ the whole Œ cell phones, 
the computers, that™s all Œ it all comes 
from 
[indecipherable]
. Cable 
TV
, needing to ha Œ buying 
more than Œ living above 
your Œ your means, yeah. 
Q: So kind of a Œ a consumer Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ as a consumer 
[indecipherable]
. 
A: It™s true. Even when I fir 
Œ when I first came to Œ to 
Israel
, I would Œ there were 
things like Œ that would bother me. For in
stance, I remember walking in the street, 
and Œ and people come and they  push you ou
t of the way to get 
to the bus stop, you 
know? Things like that would bother me, 
and Œ until I ended up, I remember once, 
passing someone wh o pushed me, and I pushed her back.  
Q: You™ve become Israeli. 

A: I™ve become Israeli. And now we have 
like an Œ a different thing in that Œ are 
you Russian? No, you™re not Russian. 

Q: Me?

Q: Lithuanian. 
A: Oh, Lithuanian.  
Q: Actually Lithuanian 
[indecipherable]
 I™m American 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: No 
[indecipherable]
. So, today, for instance, th
e Russians tend to do th-the 
things that Œ you know, they just 
[indeciphera ble]
 you don™t know th at you have to 
stand on line and they  push ahead, and 
things like that. Th
en again, this Œ 
Q: I could tell you stories. I™ve lived Œ I™ve lived in eastern 
Euro pe. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: And the American part of me is just 
shocked. Ab solutely shocked by th e Œ the Œ 
the lack of behavior, you 
know, the Œ the impoliteness Œ 
A: Of Americans, yeah. 

Q: Œ of Œ of Œ of eastern Europeans. 

A: Okay .  
Q: Because in public life, people are very 
rude to one another. Privately they™re not, 
because privately you™ve gone
 out Œ you™ve been Œ you™v
e gone over a barrier of 
trust. That is, they now trust you once you
™re inside their home, and the behavior is 
different. But in public, it is atrocious. It is
 just Œ you know, it would flabberg ast me  
Œ

Q: Abso lutely. 

A: Œ are Israelis, I™d say ifI™m Œ when I™m Œ especially in
 New York Œ 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Œ if I hear Hebrew, which you hear so 
Œ a lot of, and you know th ey™re Israelis, 
you know 
[indeciphera ble]
. I also, for instance, back so metime in  the 80s, I Œ I Œ I 
went to buffal Œ to 
[indecipherable]
 
South Africa
 to teach bla Œ blacks there. And 
via the gov Œ Israeli government. 

Q: Do you have dual citizenship? 

A: Yes. And I rememb er being very 
[indecipherable]
 these who were on staff that 
was there, because it was a Œ a project to teac
h blacks their crafts, so that they could 
then go on and Œ 
Q: Make money. 

A: Œ earn money, right. And it was extrem
ely frustrating because what I could see, 
what was s-spending a fortune, the govern
ment was spending a fortune of money on 
us, training these people, and not gi
ving th em anything, and that really 
[indecipherable]
 me, and I Œ I would get so annoyed by it. 
Q: It t Œ it™s typical for all governments. 

A: Yeah. So Œ

Q: I was part of Œ when I lived in eastern

 and i Œ and in 
Euro pe
 betw een 
1990 and 2000, I worked for 
a lot of organizations, and th at was Œ what your insight 
was, is exactly something I shared. They 
wo uld say there™s aid for this or that

 and demo cracy and all those other nice 
things, but the money didn't  
go into the pockets of the Œ 
A: Into the pockets, yeah, right. 
Q: Œ yeah . It went into the pockets of th
e contractors who knew how to get the Œ the 
assignment. 

A: Assignment, exactly. So that Œ that type
 of thing, and I Œ I Œ I remember w h en I 
first came there they immediately , a part
y for the newcomers. It was a project of 
two years, I came in only for two months. 
I was supposed to be fo r three months, 

but they  kind of messed up on it, and I sa
id, I™m t Œ here for two months and that™s 
it. They pa Œ bu Œ very wo
nder Œ good salary, a car. All 
I had to do is pay for my  
food. A-And, I would end up go
ing back  to the school in the evenin g to Œ because I 
n Œ I found that Œ I realized that the Œ 
the girls, they were mainly young ki Œ 
younger girls, were fro m villages, and they 
had Œ they had nothing to do after four 
or fi Œ after the school closed at four or
 five o™clock, there was nothing fo r them to 
do. So I would come back to work, and th
ey  learned that I would be there, and I 
would bring dried f-fo
od or coffee, and I would shar
e it with them. You know, and

the other Israelis got very annoyed with 
me when I was giving
 so much 
to them. 
You know, this is Œ we™re here to help them, 
not fo r us t-to take. So, that Œ that kind 
of thing is, you know, where Œ 
I don™t think that™s an Israeli thing, that™s just bad 
government policies. 
Q: Well, it™s Œ it™s Œ I also Œ it™s endemic fo
r th Œ with all such structures, and those 
are the structures that exist. 

A: Right, right, right. 
Q: Whether it™s the European 
Union, or whether it™s the 
United States, 
or whatever. 
Whatever country is giving the aid, usua
lly benefits its o w n citizens through that 
aid.  

A: Yeah, right. Cause I Œ I remember also 
once there Œ basically, we were teaching 
them so that they could teach people fro
m villages, you know? And I kept saying, 
well, I want to go to these Œ I want to go 
to a village, to see 
what conditions they 
will be teaching in. Because
 if I Œ suddenly I™m dema
nding that we have proper 
seats, and proper lighting. But then  I sa
id, what Œ what Œ what goes on in the 
village? They™re sittin g outside, on Œ they  
don™t have chairs, they don™t have lights. 
They work until Œ they
 can work until Œ until it™s su Œ 
sundown and then they have 
no electricity, so how Œ how Œ why Œ 

Q: But it wasn™t Œ this experience wasn™t
 sufficient to get you turned off from Œ

A: No, no. This was just Œ look, I Œ I 
think I™m not very 
good with Œ with 
institutions altogether. I Œ I never taught 
in school, because of what I saw of the 
school system here in 
America,
 not Œ not just in 
Israel
. I never taught in 
Israel Œ 
and in Œ in 
America
 I only student taught, and that was quite enough for me. I-I Œ 
I™m not Œ I-I Œ I Œ also, even when I worked
, I™ve been inde Œ independent more or 
less since 70s.  
Q: Tell me a little bit about Œ about your life Œ 
A: What I do. 
Q: Œ because we Œ no, well, no, we star Œ 
we started at 1 9 63, 
and then kind of Œ 
what happened sequentially, 
sort of. When  you moved th
ere in ™63 to live, what 
happened , and then  
[indeciphera ble]
 rest. 
A: Okay, basically, th e first six months I l
earned Hebrew, and th en I just wanted to 

ge-get work, and I found work
 in a silks Œ doing silkscre
en printing. Outsi Œ I was 
living with this Œ 
ulpan
 was in
 Jerusalem
, and th is job was outside of Œ near 
Tel 
Aviv.
 So  I moved th ere. 
Q: Did you have friends or family from the 
U.S.
 that were already there? 
A: No family, no. 
Q: No family.

A: Well, a Œ very  good friends of th
e family. And I had friends from Young 
Judaea
 
that were in 
Israel
 already. And I quickly made fri
ends with Israelis. I knew more 
Israelis than I knew Ameri
cans. And I just say Œ I mean, I Œ I Œ I just went from Œ 
basically from Œ okay, I Œ I got ja Œ a j
ob working in this Œ 
in doing silkscreen 
printing, and I was mo re or less in charge 
of th e wo man, the work
er that was there. 
And that pushed me to Œ to speak Hebrew
 qui Œ mo re quickly because I was in 
charge of her, and she always spoke Œ or
 French, or Hebrew. 
So I spoke French. 
And 
[indecipherable]
 and after about three months, my  boss said, maybe in five 
years we™ll become partners. A
nd I looked at him and I said
, this is not the place for 
me. Because this was outside of
 Tel Aviv
, it was in a little place that was Œ I s Œ I Œ 
I don™t know what I was doing there. 
I would come back  every weekend to 
Jerusalem
 because that™s where I had friends. 
And after three months Œ af Œ when 
he said this I moved back to
 Jerusalem
, and I Œ I had several Œ I mean, I went from 
Œ like a year I worked for a s Œ a publis
hing co mp any doing graphic work . And I 
w o rk ed  fo r ﬁ
The Jerusa lem Post
ﬂ doing graphic work . And 
I was always pain ting 
or doing art work , but I wasn™t doing it fu
ll time because I was working in places, 
until about the early 70s, or Œ 
just about the 70s, yeah, I th
ink late 60s, beginning of 
the 70s, I decided to go and wo rk on my  ow
n. And I became partners with a Danish 
guy, he was going to si Œ he did silkscreen
 printing, I did mo re of the graphic work,

and he did Œ he did pr
inting for Œ for artists and all so
rts of things like that, until he 
left. And I just continued being independent
, because I™m not Œ again, I™m not good 
with institutions of any kind, I Œ I don™t lik
e Œ like even when I 
worked for the Œ for 
the 
Post,
 or for the publishing comp any, I ha
d Œ I know wh at I had to do. I had 
never liked clocking in. I didn't have to cloc
k in at the time. I did the work that I had 
to do, and you Œ more, if it was necessary. 
But don™t tell me what
 Œ you know, i-if 
my work is not good, I™m willing to hear it, 
but if Œ the hours I had to put in, I™m not 
good with that. So it™s as Œ the same ki Œ 
I Œ I needed to  be always independen t, and 
I guess that™s part of my Œ my  whole makeup
, is just to be, you know, where I need 
to be. 
Q: Did your adoptive parents have 
those sorts of artistic streaks? 
A: My mo th er, eviden tly, at some Œ of one Œ 
had wanted to be an interior decorator, 
my adopted mothe
r. My father, no 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Was he a businessman? 
A: But he would Œ yeah, businessman, but 
he was mo re Œ yeah, he sang and he s Œ 
he loved telling about himself, of his Œ hi
s whole background and that. So he was 
very vocal. And my  mo ther, they had a Œ 
a Œ a business, a furn
iture shop, and she 
kept the books and all that, they wo rked  
together, but he was mo re outside, talking

A: Only what they did, a

ich I, at some point, I don™t 
remember, I got photos 
fro m my  co u sin s in

 And she told Œ th -the cousin Œ 
this cousin told me a little, 
because she didn Œ she™s olde

Q: Œ 
America. 
And Œ and so  wh en Œ before 
America
 went away, how did it Œ how 
did these things, even  thou
gh you didn't  seek them Œ 
A: Okay, because my Œ okay
, because our parents, our 
adoptive parents, kept in 
touch with the family in Œ in
 France
, that 
[in d ecipherable]
 
Q: Which Œ which hid you? 

A: No. 

Q: Oh no. 
A: No, no. It™s a family th
at™s our family, our immediat
e family. Cousin Œ tw o sets 
of cousins. They  help ed them
 out financially, they help ed 
[indecipherable]
 
daughters Œ one of the fa Œ one of the 
cousins, their daughters came to visit
 
America
 and th ey stayed with my  parents.
 In fact, by then, when I was in 
Isr ael
, 
they also came to visit me in
 Israe l
. And I had no contact with
 them, with that part 
of the family. But there was Œ there was 
connection without bein
g very to Œ they 
never made any great effort, so that this is
 one of the reasons that I believe that I 
don™t speak French, is that this one rela
tive, th e father, who™s since passed away, I 
was there, I think in ™6
4, coming back from the 
States
, from the visit, it was a year 
later that I would move ther
e. And I stopped in Œ in 
France
, and I stayed with them, 
and they  were

Q: This was a blood relative

A: 
[indecipherable]
 relative, yeah. And he just went
 on Œ I got very upset, he went 
on ab out how he blamed my  Œ our adoptive pa
rents for the fact that we didn™t speak 
French. And I got really very  annoyed with
 him. And since then I just never ma de 
any great effort to keep in 
contact, nor did they . All right. 
Q: The French relatives. 
A: Now, that I Œ the French relatives. No
w, there™s another c
ousin, who today we™re 
in touch with, but at the tim
e I had met Œ her father was still alive, her mother was 
my  aunt Œ my  second aunt. My
 aunt which he wa Œ she was, I think my  father™s 
sister, but I don™t remember exactly now. 
And it just Œ cause it doesn™t really matter 
to me. The fa Œ her father, who was still aliv
e when I came to visit, he was Œ he was 
very pleasant, he was okay.
 And I don™t know wh a Œ I don™t know if Œ I guess I Œ 
yeah, I probably  met Œ he had a Œ a Œ okay
, I have a cousin, and his brother. We met 
at the time. But then
 when I Œ when I Œ 
when I was living in
 Israel
, and he knew I 
was living in
 Israel
, and I came back to 
Israel, 
and then  for years I had Œ we had no 
contact at all. And then  suddenly they
 Œ I get Œ sh-she called, she was in 
Israel , 
and 
she didn™t know how to find me. And I al
w Œ I said, how can that be? I mean, you 

knew I was in 
Israel
. The father Œ your fa
ther knew I was in 
Israel.
 My parents at 
the time were still alive, so there was 
no problem finding out where I was. And sh e 
went to 
Yad Vashem,
 the Holocaust museum in Œ in 
Jerusalem
 to try to find me.

And they said, well what Œ why not look in
 the phone book? And they found me in 
the phone book, of co urse, you know. And th
at™s how we came  in contact again. 
And they™ve been very, very nice. I mean
, they™re very pleasant people, and I like 
them. We meet. We 
Œ  they™ve been to 
Mitzpe Ramon
 since I moved there, they 
come to visit. Three years ago I was Œ I came to the 
States, 
and then  I went for two 
weeks to 
Paris,
 so we just met for dinner. 
Q: But did they feel more Œ 
A: I didn't stay with them. 
Q: Do they feel more like people 
who are not in your inner circle? 
A: Very definitely. The-They™re Œ let™s 
say they could be, but they ™re not. I like 
them very much, they™re very wa
rm, but there™s Œ I think again
 Jack 
is mu ch  mo re 
Œ much closer to them than 
I am. I probably at si Œ insome place said okay, I know 
they™re my relatives, b u t it™s Œ it™s a Œ a stat
ement, and that™s it. It™s not all that 
strong relationship. 
Q: Sounds like relatives without being family. 
A: Without being family, right. I feel much 
closer to whatever relatives I have left 
here than I do them. 
Q: From your adopted family.

A: But yeah Œ but they ™re Œ 
but, I mean, this couple ag
ain, I like them very much, 
but Œ and I enjoy being with them when  I 
see them, but it™s always a very brief kind 
of thing. 
Q: Did th ey ever tell you anything? Did th
ey know anything about your parents? 
Did they  ever share anything? 
A: Well, yes, she Œ the cousin knew my  par Œ knew Œ rememb ers my Œ my  mo th er 

very much, she remembers her. 
She described her and th e f
act that they were both 
se-seamstress Œ sewers and all that. But we™ve never real Œ well, again, I don™t think 

I made any great effort to sit with them a
nd get all that informa
tion. And if you te Œ 
aga Œ last Œ the last time I was in
 Paris,
 they were busy, and 
we Œ I had Œ we met 
once for dinner at their house. I slept one 
weekend there, because the place where I 
was staying, I had to Œ I-I couldn™t stay
 with who Œ it was a friend of mine, I 
couldn™t stay that weekend so, they 
allowed me to stay
. I didn™t feel 
[indecipherable]
. I pushed myself on them, I needed 
a place to stay  that night, so I 
stayed with them. But 
they were then going on vacation, you know. 
Q: So Œ excuse me, it so
unds like there aren™t Œ there weren 't any really warm 
connections to
 France. 
A: No, I Œ that™s right.

Q: And her name is Œ 

A: Œ they ™ve made Œ 
Sallah

Q: 
Sallah
(ph). 
A: She™s made Œ they ™v e Œ she and her husband 
George
 have made efforts to make 
connection with me. I know he™s
 Œ they™re much closer with 
Jack.
 The other 
cousins, I™ve manage Œ I™ve Œ a few times, in 
fact, let™s Œ the father Œ the father, who 
passed away already a long time ago, who put
 Œ blamed my parents for the fact that 
we didn™t speak French, I never Œ after 
that I never have come Œ I haven™t had 
contact with them. And there was one time 
like about, I don™t know, I think 10 - 11 

- 12 years ago th at I went with 
Jack 
and his wife
 Judy,
 we went to 
France
, and we 
went Œ my  cousins
 Sa lla h

 for dinner, and this man who knew we 
were coming Œ the Œ well, she™s the cousin
, actually, his wife, but they were on

 me, that™s enough to
 not even search 
for them. And

to my  brother. He wants to make contact 
with the Œ with these people, fine. I have 
no Œ no problem with 
that. I don™t need the

And ag ain, they made no great effort to Œ to keep us

A: Perhaps that™s why. 
Q: That Œ sometimes that happens, you kn
ow. I re Œ I rememb er Œ and one of the

x,y,z
, you 
know. But let me run this th

and had th e good luck to gr
ow up in a Œ in a loving family, sometimes nevertheless 
have a feeling in side that someone at one
 point rejected them, because they were 
adopted in the first place. So mebody in the early part of
 their lives. It doesn ™t Œ it 
sometimes doesn™t have any connection to
 reality. I mean, they may know, for 
example, that my mother did not want 
to give me up, my mo ther would have 
preferred to keep me, but she gave me 
up. But that there was a certain kind of 

rejection, and Œ that was experienced an
yway, even though co
nsciously  you know 
that that other person™s, the birth mother™s
 circumstances could ha
ve been such that 
they had no choice. And wh en I hear you 
speak about the relatives th at were blood 
relatives in 
France
, it sounds that they had no great 
interest to keep up ties.  
A: That, definitely yes, I mean, I Œ  I see th
at, I feel that. A nd, again, I™ve given Œ if 
they annoyed me enough Œ also, very Œ I 
think make decisions, you know, it™s Œ it™s 
not making Œ not always logical, but this is
 fact for me. I don™t Œ I would not go out 

of my way to change these facts. This iswhat it is, and that™s okay, but I will not go 
begging to these people to 
be Œ to what, to accept me
? I mean, this Œ I™m your 
relative. To this day we have no Œ I™ve be
en to their home, stay
ed with them once 
while back  there, some  years way, way ba
ck. I made the effort
 to come to visit 
them. Their daughters then came to me in Œ in 
Israel.
 They were Œ I was Œ they 
really annoyed me, because they just expect
ed that you Œ to Œ to  do everything. I™m

not used to that kind of thing, I was Œ di
dn™t grow up th at way. So  it would Œ it just 
Œ and they  Œ again, they  never made any mo
re effort to keep in touch with me, at 
least this particular set of relatives. The 
others, yes, they™ve made every effort, and 
we stay in touch. So they™re Œ they™re fine
. I Œ I Œ we™re not that close, but still it™s Œ 
it™s a feelin g that they Œ yes,
 they™re my relatives, I accept
 them that way. I can™t Œ I 
don™t feel as close to them, perhaps, as relatives in 
America
, but what they are, it™s 
okay. S Œ not Œ I do Œ I™m not angry with 
th em, I am probably angry Œ I definitely,

Q: Well, I guess that™s Œ I wasn™t putting Œ I

mething there which is Œ I don™t Œ

latives, blame people wh o Œ 
who gave so mu ch to me, and to 
Jack

then to blame them? 
Well, but did you make any effort to bring me to
 France, 
to remind me of who Œ 

who Œ what my  background
 is? Nothing. So , why Œ 
Q: Well, that might be one of those answers.  
A: Yes, well that™s Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 so interesting.

A: Exactly. But I Œ I never had a chance to

to talk to them. 
Jack
 
isn™t bothered by that. We™ve Œ 
again, we™re very different Œ 
Q: Different people. 
A: Œ in our reactions to th
ings. We™re very different in everything, so it™s not 
unusual. 
Q: What about the French family that 
hid you? Do  you ha
ve any contact or 
knowledge of them? 
A: Yeah, no, I don™t Œ he Œ he 
did. He went to Œ he went to meet them, he Œ he even 
Œ in fact, he™s Œ he gave me a letter that 
they wrote. I think th at the Œ the parents 
have since passed away, but their daughters a
nd th ey Œ they™re aliv
e, and he Œ he did 
meet with them, and I never Œ I never Œ I 
never made the contact. I said, it™s like,

rvivor™s conference, 
does it speak to you? 
A: I don™t know, it™s the firs
t time that I Œ I happened to  
be here. I™m not s Œ I didn™t 
come especially for this. I 
Œ I was here because my  Œ 
Jack™s
 wife™s dau 
Œ daughter 
got married, so they kept saying please 
come, please come, and I came. And then 
there was the conference, I said, okay I™
ll come to the conference as well.

Q: Have you ever been any 
Œ to any other Holo caust re
lated conference? And when 
Œ 
A: No, no. And I don™t think 
that I would make an effort to come. Maybe after Œ 
after this time, I might. I know there was one in 
Jerusalem
 last year, I didn™t Œ 
didn™t go to it. I don™t Œ I also Œ I don™t lik
e even seeing movies of Œ of that time. I 
don™t like repetitions of the whole thing.
 I know it happened, I know it was, but 

okay, I Œ I think Œ ag ain, I believe that
 we should go fo rward, and not to Œ 
Q: So where Œ yes, but where is Œ wher
e Œ what about it is where you say, how 
could Œ I don™t know exac
tly how Œ how to phrase th
is, but what about it is 
repetitious? It™s not the best way of phrasing 
this, but di Œ I wa Œ yeah, what about it 
is so Œ 
A: I was born here, I grew up here, I wa
s hidden, I was Œ it™s so mu ch of Œ I Œ I 
can™t Œ I can™t really answer that, becaus
e I have to think mu
ch more about it. I 
don™t know. 
Q: But it seems key. 
A: It™s Œ it™s Œ doesn ™t push me any place, 
it™s Œ to me it says, okay, it™s like Œ there 
are things that you need to re
peat, like if I want to learn 
how to work  w
ith this, with 
a certain material, that™s important for me to
 repeat it so that I 
get to know what the

material is like, how to work
 with it. To make contact wi
 Œ this to me doesn™t Œ for 
me personally, it™s not going to  make me a better person, a better artist, just by Œ 
Q: What do you think it gives other people? 
A: I don™t know. Everyone, I Œ I believe it gives everyone something. Everyone 
something that will fi-fill them
 in some way, and again I 
have no problem with that. 
I™m not one Œ I will Œ I™m the last person 
who will say, you sh ouldn™t talk about it, 
you shouldn™t rememb er. No, if it fills you 
and it gives you so me meaning, I think 
you should do as mu ch as you 
can. Which is, for instance, one thing th at I™ve said to 
Jack
, well, you know, you need 
that, go and do it, it™s Œ but don™t involve me in 
something th at I don™t feel th at I could do. That™s all. 
Q: It sounds Œ in Œ in so me ways it soun
ds also like Œ now, again, I™m not casting 
aspersions on Œ on the people
 who have that need. I mean
, I work in an organization 
which is dedicated to this. But there are 
fundamental Christians who need  to bring 
the gospel to everybody. And part of how 
they interpret fundam
ental Christ Œ how 
they interpret their mission as
 Christians is that they™re
 not good Christians unless 
they share the gospels, yo
u know? And they ™re gonna sh
are those gospels with you 
whether Œ 
A: Whether you want 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Œ you want it or not.

A: Yeah, I w Œ I would end up keeping away
 from it, because I will Œ don™t want Œ 
also, religious Jews, I Œ you know, leave me
 be. I don™t care, be religious. If it gives 
you something, do it. But I don™t Œ for me , it™s not my way. I Œ I think sometimes 
I™m more religious some Œ than these a
ll that, you know, because
 I think what I Œ 
what I say is my Œ my word is definite
ly my  word , I don™t go back  on it. I don™t 
think that if you™re going to fast it ma
kes you a better person. Many things that I 
just think you have to  be wi
 Œ you have to be straight 
with yourself in your life, and 
that™s what™s important to me. And again, 
anyone else, do what you need  to do. I™ll 
respect you, but don™t force it on me.  
Q: Were you ever curious about having 
a conversation with this Œ the mo ther you 
never knew? Were you Œ would Œ what Œ if 
there ever had been  anything you would 

have wanted  to tell her? 

A: Ah, yeah. No, I don™t know
 wh ether I would want to tell her something, but once 
I went to Œ in Œ in 
Israel
 we have a lot of people that 
read coffee cups, and I used to 
love to go to the, like coffe
e cups or cards, tarot cards or Œ not tarot cards, but 
mainly coffee cups. And especially at
 that time when in Œ when I was in
 Israel
 at 
first, these were usually very primitive 
women, who were so 
wise. My Œ but one 
woman said to me Œ I came there and she 
said, she wa Œ sudden
ly  said, you have 
two mo thers. And she said I would meet my
 Œ my  Œ the Œ the ot
her mother like in

15 years, right? And, well, I was trippe
d out by it. I-I said, wow, this, you know, 
this is going to be very interesting. I 
know that it™s not right, but still, maybe Œ 
maybe it was. 
[indecipherable]
 you know. 
Q: What year was this? 

A: Must have been in  the mid-60s or late
 60s or something like th at. Of course, 15 
years passed and nothing ev er happened , so
 Œ but it was Œ it Œ for a long time it was 

in my  head, but why? What would 
happen if I did meet her, if the Œ 
Q: If she survived. 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 Bu t I never, never brought it to
 any Œ because I didn™t really 
believe that this Œ that it could be, so Œ 
Q: But nevertheless, she was uncanny 
that she knew you had two mo thers. 
A: Yes, yes. Uncanny, but again I think Œ no,
 she wasn™t Œ she was 
just very wise in 
that I believe she asked me what, at firs
t, what my mother™s name was. And I 
stupidly said
 Ro se
, but it™s not my real mother™s name. S o , maybe I said that. 
Something, something made it clear to her, 
because a-again, they pick up on your Œ 
the way you sit, the way you talk, what you
 say. You know, every little thing, they 
knew exactly how to  Œ how to 
interpret it, an d I Œ I reme
mber once after this, I was 
visiting friends in 
Tel Aviv
, and I said to them, oh I can Œ I Œ I could read your 
coffee cup, you know. 
And I did the same thing. And they  said 
[indecipherable]

said, don™t be ridiculous, I just Œ I™m te
lling you wh at you want
 to hear, you know, 
and so it™s Œ 
Q: Look at human beings, how much we need that. 
A: Sure, yeah, yeah.
