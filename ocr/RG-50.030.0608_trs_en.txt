such a high school gymn asium in 
Saint Petersburg.

ntage, and he was well th Œ 
he-he-he Œ he was aware of 
that, and you know, he had had th at thi Œ 
Q: Did you feel that Œ 

A: Œ 
[indecipherable] 
of that issue. 
Q: Yeah. Excuse me that I interrupted. Di
d you feel that kind of international 
horizon as you were growing up in  your fami ly
, that your father had such a Œ such a 
world view? Or would you say there woul
dn™t really be such a connection from 
when you Œ because this is 
all before you were born. 
A: Yes, yes. Yeah, I think, well, that 
generally he knew lang
uages, and so  read 
various Œ in various languages, in 
German, in Russian, 
in Polish. So Œ

A: He spoke all those languages, yes.

udying, perfecting it, reading German just to 
keep, you know, to learn the lang
uage more ca Œ more fluently.

Q: Did Œ did this make a diffe
rence in your family as you 
were growing up, that your 
mother had not had the same opportunities, 
and so the same ability to Œ to grow 
intellectually as your father had had? 
Did th ey have Œ yeah , did th at make a 
difference between them in 
how they understood things? 
A: No, not Œ not in this Œ no, th at was 
no problem because my  mo ther was quite an 
active woman, and sh e learned whatever sh
e could, things, you know. And I don™t 
think that the people could say that she didn™
t have that mu ch formal education. Sh e 
had Œ she read a lot and she learned from th
e people she Œ sh-she met. Her brothers 
were quite advanced also in the independent 
Lithuania

Skodvilla
(ph), not far from
 Taurag

 because my father was 
appointed a judge there. So, 
we went there, but we lived very short time, because I 
had to go to the high school, and that was in
 Taurag
¡
. There was no Œ none high 
school in 
Skodvilla
(ph), so I went back to 
Ta ura g
¡
 and lived with
 some other 
people, and my parents thought that Œ

, this wouldhave been mi
ddle school? At age 10 would

ool, or would have been later Œ 
A: Well, in the Lithuanian system, what they  called a Œ was a grammar school for 

four years, and then  a Œ

October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
18
Q: I see, I see.  
A: And that was th Œ th-the Œ the educatio
n, and so  I Œ I went with  that so-called 
gymnasium to the first class in
 Taurag
¡
, but my parents th
ought that th-that 
arrangement was very unsatisfactory. He requ
ested that he would be transferred to a 
Œ the larger city where I could live with my
 family. And so  he took again, he took, 
instead of being a judge he took ag ain 
th-the previous positi
on of prosecutor Œ 
assistant prosecutor I would call, in 
Panev
¡
žys
, which was a larger city, not much 
mo re sophisticated than 
Ta ura g
¡
. T a u r ag
¡
 
was sophisticated town. I di Œ 
Q: What made it sophisticated? 

A: It was very near 
to the German city, 
Tilž
¡
, and there was a lot of traffic between 
Taurag
¡
 
and 
Tilž
¡
, and th e so-called 
Lithua nia  Minor
, or 
Klaip
¡
dos kraıtas
 was 
also very near 
Taurag
¡
, just a few kilometers away, 
and the relationship with that 
German influence, German cultural influe
nced area, you know, had an effect on 
Taurag
¡
 also. 
Q: Did it Œ this re Œ leads me to a questio
n I was also thinking about. As you were 
growing up, your very earliest years, did you sense that there were others in 

Taurag
¡
 who were not Lithuanian? Did you 
Œ you know, did yo
u know of other 
nationalities, other groups of people, 
and Œ who made up 
the population of 
Taurag
¡
?

A: No, they were not German Œ an
d there were Germans also in Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ in

hostility in Œ at all, you know, we Œ 
Q: Were there Poles in
 Taurag
¡
? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: So th e population would have been made
 up of these Œ were there any Ru ssians in 
Taurag
¡
?  
A: Maybe a family or two,
 but very few, if any. 
Q: So you would hav Œ i-
if I were to describe

city that was made up of Lithuanians of

Q: And Œ and you were

anyway, did you Œ do you think so mething ch
anged after the Nazis came to power in

 Taurag
¡
 and in the region in general, was 
there any friction that developed, was ther
e any Œ anything th at changed in that? Did 
it Œ you think it had an influence at all? 
A: We had an influence but I am not aw
are of any increased friction. There was 
influence. The Jewish people were very mu
ch  concerned, and the Lithuanian people, 
because the Germans became 
quite aggressive in Œ in
 Klaip

da

oh, 
Klaip
¡
da  
is the Œ is a Œ a haven city  of Œ of 
Lithuania
, a port 
city. 

Q: It™s a port city. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
23
A: A port city of 
Lithuania
 and th e third in th e size on 
Œ in the country. The capital 
city 
Vilnius
 is first, 
Kaunas
 second, and 
Klaip
¡
da  
is the third. And at that time in 
Klaip
¡
da
 was, I think the majori
ty of the population in 
Klaip
¡
da 
city
, 
a majority 
may be German about that time. In  th
e countryside not so
. In the countryside
 
Lithuanians pre-predominated, but they we
re also very much 
influenced by the 
German culture through it Œ through centurie
s, really, they were
 under the German 
rule there. And the Œ during
 the Œ when the Nazis came 
to power, they became very 
aggressive in that area. They  wanted to Œ it was part of the 
Germany
 before the first 
World War, and the 
Germany
 wanted to recover that te
rritory, and they very Œ b-
became very aggressive against the Lithuanian
. So we were aware of that, that there 
was a hostile force right next to us. 
Q: Were they close to each other, 
Taurag
¡
 
and 
Klaip
¡
da
? As Œ as Œ 
A: 
Klaip
¡
da
 not so c-close, but the 
Klaip
¡
da 
area, 
Klaip
¡
da  
territory was quite 
near. I don™t know how many kilometers, 
maybe seven, eight kilo meters from the 
Klaip
¡
da 
area, which was au-autonomous area 
which had, you know, their own 
laws, German laws, and their th Œ bo-both 
languages were official, Lithuanian  and 

German. And so  we became that 
Lithuania
 is now Lithuanian Œ Lithuanian 
character and Lithuanian rule and 
Lithuania
 is under attack, under Œ under pressure 
when  the Œ when  Œ when
 Hitler
 took over in 
Germany
, right there, because before 
that there was no su
ch hostility. But in

the German population, as far as I

know were quite loyal to the 
Lithuania
 and there were no fric Œ friction I am aware 
between Germans and Lithuanians in

itself. 
Q: And were there discuss Œ do you rememb
er any kinds of discussions about this 
wider political context that you just talked
 about at home? Do you Œ I mean, I™m Œ 
I™m again tr ying to look through
 the eyes of a 10 year old boy. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How much of this would have been in
 the atmo sphere, how mu ch would it have 
been talked about? 

A: Well, a lot, a lot. 

Q: A lot? 
A: In the family and outside the family w
ith the f-friends o-of Œ of my family, you 
know, the other families, which were Œ 
Q: Do you remember such 
discussions taking place? 
A: Yes, yes, and well Œ well, so Œ one th
ing about Œ well, this is out of the time 
frame, but I was surprised when I came to 
Lithuania
 and I asked about some 
Germans now, after 
Lithuania
 became independent, I went to 
Taurag
¡
.
 
Q: And what year was this? Just to 
establish what we™re talking about. 
A: 1990. 

Q: Okay, so 1990, what Œ 

A: In 1990 I went to

A: And his wife was from

, and she told me about all those people I knew, 
you know, and all that kind of
 thing. And I was surprised that th Œ mo st Œ one of the 
richest people in 
Ta ura g
¡
 was German, and he was an
 authority of the German 
community in 
Taurag
¡
.
 And I was surprised that he didn™t go to 
Germany
 when the 
Germans had the chance to go to 
Germany
 ah Œ wh en  the Soviets took over the li Œ 
Lithuania
. 
Q: After the end of th e war you mean? 
A: No, before this Œ 

Q: Oh, I see, there™s ger Œ okay. Before Œ 
A: Before the war, wha Œ when  the Soviets took over
 Lithuania
 Œ 
Q: The first ti Œ 
A: Œ they had an agreement with 
Germany
 that the German na-nash Œ German, 
ethnic Germans could go to 
Germany
 Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ to leave 
Lithuania. 
And I was surprised to know 
that he, that German, didn™t 
go to  Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to 
Germany
, because he was so hostile against 
Hitler
, and the 
Nazis knew that, that for 
him to go to the Œ to 
Germany
 would be to go to Œ directly 
to a concentration camp. So he just stayed
 there with his family, and of course was

deported to 
Siberia
. And Œ and I think that he died in 
Siberia
, but his children, his Œ 
his daughter, he had three daughters, they came back to 
Lithuania
. 
Q: Would have he been deported Œ we™re ju
mp ing ahead of ourselves a little bit, but 
do you th ink he would 
have been deported after the wa
r, or during the first Soviet 
occupation? 
A: During first Soviet occupation. 

Q: Occupation. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And why? Because he was German? 

A: Yes, of course.  
Q: I see. 
A: 
[indecipherable] 
if Œ well, the Œ the Soviets c
onsidered such people spies. 
Q: I see. 

A: No matter, that Œ that was enough, that he was German, so he was a spy in their 
eyes. 
Q: What about the Jewish population,
 was it a large Jewish population in 
Ta urag
¡
? 
A: Yes, yes. Well, about a third 
of the p-population I would say. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]

 friends after he moved out. 
Q: What was his name , do you rememb er? 
A: I don™t rememb er now, no. 
Q: Okay, do you reme mber anything about 
him? How old Œ how 
old were you when  
he was your friend? 

A: Six, seven. 
Q: Oh, so you were young. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Did your family have any in
teraction with Œ with Jews, either in a 
professional way, in a personal way? 

A: Both, but infrequently. Si
nce my father was working 
in his capacity as an 
assistant prosecutor, I would say th e young 
students, after they graduated from the 

law school in 
Lithuania
 had to , if they wanted to wo rk  in the court system Œ but 
also, if they would like to be come lawyers, they had to 
go through a Œ some practice 
in various capacities. S o  my father alwa
ys had some young, just graduated young 

man or Œ or ladies, one of Œ of th em wa
s Œ was a lady, who ju st went through the 
practice several months Œ well, not a 
year maybe, maybe a year, I don™t know 
exactly what the term was. So some of th
em were Jewish, and I remember ra Œ you 
know, Mr. toris -- 
Teri spolstis

ith my father, and also

had, you know, just a relation. He visite
d us and I remember him very well, you 
know. 

Q: What was he like, do you reme
m Œ what do you rememb er of Œ 
A: Oh, very friendly and fu nny young man. 
Well, I liked him very much, and well, I 
do Œ I didn™t want to go into small incident
s like that, but there was, you know, I was 
about five years old, I think. I don™t reme
mber it very well, but 
they tell me that I 
found my father™s pistol, and I took that Œ 
that pistol and I went thro ugh wh -where 
my father™s office was, and where Mr. 
Terispolstis
(ph)
 
was work ing. My father was 
not in th e office, he was on some Œ I don™t 
know, some errand. And so I went to Mr. 
Terispolstis
(ph) and said, look what I found, 
you know, and showed the pistol. And 
he said, oh, that™s nice. Just s-show it to
 me. And he just jump
ed, you know, on me, 
because he was afraid that 
the, you know, stupid kid Œ 
Q: It could be loaded , yeah. 

A: Œ that yeah, it could be loaded , and Œ 
and he took th at pistol away. Well, I was 
kind of shocked, but then everybody was te
lling th at story, and 
so it gav Œ kind of 
became a hero in the story, and I Œ I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know if it was loaded, or did you? 
A: No, I don™t know.

 Œ i Œ your parents 
Œ you were an only 
child. Do  you consid er yourself that you we
re close to your parents? Were you a 
close knit family, or Œ 
A: Yes, yes, I was. In particular Œ well,
 no, when I was small 
with my mother, but 
when I was growing up, I became
 very close to my father. 
Q: What Œ in wh at ways would you describe
 that closeness? Did he Œ did you discuss 
Œ  

A: Yes, we discuss things of Œ various
 things, whatever. An
d he sometimes took 
some educational things, you know, told me 
about finance, about his work, about the 
problems they have, or Œ well, they had s 
Œ he had some arithmetical exercises, some 

arithmetical puzzles which he Œ that was educ
ational, so Œ so he spent time with me, 
and we Œ we were very
, very, very close. 
Q: What would Œ how would you descri
be him as a pers

personality did he have?  

A: Well, he was out Œ very 
outgoing, yeah, with a Œ with a lot Œ lot of humo r. And

 you Œ did you go Œ were you s Œ did you go to any 
religious classes outside of wh at was offered

system? 
A: Not Œ not under Œ u-until th
e Soviet occupation, when th
e co Œ of course religious 
instruction was abolished, and th ere were out
side and in  the churches they had some 
educational lectures, discussions, something like that. Just then.  

Q: Okay . 

A: Before that, no.  
Q: I™m jumping back a little b
it. Do you know of a Œ anyt
hing of what

Q: Do you have any other memo ri
es of the Jewish community  in 
Taurag
¡
, or 
anybody that you would have known from ther
e, or who had interaction with  your 
family? 
A: N-Not Œ I know my father, you know, 
was interacting with some, and some Œ 
with some Jewish people, some Œ some lawy
ers and doctors, but they were not that 
close, they didn™t come to visit us, or 
Œ I Œ I d Œ I don™t know much about them. 
Q: Were there any discussions at home th
at you rememb er as a child and growing 
up, ab out who th e Jews were? 
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: What Œ what was usually said? 
A: Mostly it was in connection with 
the religious differences, and with the 
discussion about the Œ a Ho
ly Bible, the Jewish Torah and the Catholic 
interpretations of that. You 
know, something like that. You see, I had a c Œ a cousin 
from my father™s s-sid e, my 
father™s oldest brother had 
a ch Œ a son, older than 
myself, who became a Catholic priest. So Œ 
and he visited our family quite often for 
awhile, he lived with us, but 
not for su Œ but Œ he was no 
Œ th-that time i-in Œ in th Œ 
high school, but later he became a c Œ a Ca
tholic priest. A nd he 
visited us and there 
was a lot of religious discussion also going on with him. 

Q: And what kind of Œ I mean, the religi
ous discussion can Œ can be very broad. 

A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

32
Q: It can be both subtle, and it can be very simp le. 
A: Right. 

Q: And wa Œ were there Œ ho
w would you characterize th
ese discussions? Were they 
of real interpretation of what the Bible was and what the Torah was, or were they 

more sort of the kind of, you kn
ow, a more simple interpretations? 
A: Well, I would s Œ I Œ I would sel Œ I wo
uld say b-both. It wa
s Œ but when  Œ when  
Œ when my cousin b
ecame a priest and I was a teenag
er, I think Œ a-and Œ and my 
father also j o ined those discussions, I 
think they were Œ they were quite, quite 
advanced in Œ and Œ and in Œ it 
was not a primitive thing at all. 
Q: So what were the Œ what was the nature
 of them? What a Œ what are the kinds of 
comp arisons that would be made? If you 
can reme mb er, you know, in general. 
A: Well, first recall s Œ  discussion about 
Œ ab out God itself, whether Œ wh ether you 
know, believing or not believing, and th
en, you know, going Œ going f Œ well, tha-
that was not Œ it had nothing w
ith the Jewish, it was generally. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Whether there is a supreme being, 
you know, and cause 
of everything, of 
existence of the world. And as far as the 
Holy Bible is concerned, of course, the 
question about the Christ, about
 his importance and wh at Œ wh at Œ who was he real Œ 
really, 
Jesus
 from
 Nazareth. 
So  those Œ those things were, you know Œ 
Q: How was that answered? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
33
A: Well, of course, in a Catholic way, you
 know, that he was a per-person Œ a divine 
person. 
Q: And I guess what I™m trying to Œ 
A: Part of the divinity, something like Œ ye
ah, something in th Œ 
in that way. But it 
was discussed, it wasn™t discussed in which 
way, you know, what Œ what proves that, 
why we Œ do we believe it li-like this or so
mething. It was not something given, you 
know, so Œ 

Q: Yes. And in what way was there Œ 
what was the Jewi sh
 element in this 
discussion, in these types 
of religious discussions? 
A: Well, they are part of the Catholic Œ Ca
tholic religion. My Œ 
my cousin told once, 
you know, or even several ti
mes that, you know, that th
ere are some elements in 
Catholic liturgy which was saved from theold-time Jewish cust
oms and Œ and Œ and 
which the Jews, the rabbinical Jews have 
lost. So even that the Catholics have 
something from the older Jewish religions, it wa
s not ant Œ anti Jewish at all like its Œ 
itself, it was a discussion of the relationshi
p of the Jewish religion and the Catholic 
religion Œ well, Christian religion, which 
really split off from Œ from the Judaism, 
and why did they sp lit off, and 
Œ well, of course they th
en Œ the Œ the person of 
Jesus
 
of
 Nazareth 
comes into that. That™s why you k
now, and what he Œ what was his 
message basically, and why di
d they had to split from theJewish what Œ what the 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

34
Jews had rejected and the Catholics 
accepted Œ I mean Christians accepted. 
Something like that. 
Q: Well, you know, there have been  religio
us discussions about Jewish influence on 
Christian religions that Œ that were very 
broadly accepted in Œ 
in many populations, 
Catholic populations of the Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ Jews killed Christ. And this was trying 
Œ this was part of what I was trying to 
get at Œ 

A: Oh, I see. 

Q: Œ was that something that was part of 
such discussions and an interpretation in 
such way, it was, you know, a sense of did 
Œ not necessarily within your own family, 
but in the larger community, 
when Jews were discusse d, was that something that 
would co me up? 

A: I don™t know in the larg
er community because
 tha-that type of discussions were 
kind of inside of the family
. Rarely, you know, sometimes we
 talk with other priests. 
It was not subject wh ich people would just
 meet and start discussing like this. 
Q: Did Œ yes, of course. 
A: And Œ but in my family in particular
 when Œ wh en my Œ my  cousin became a 
priest, you know, those things came up regularl
y. And there was, yes Œ well, there is 
something in  Œ in Œ in th e 
gospels which calls about the 
je Œ y-you know, the Jewish

35
people demanding th at 
Jesus
 from
 Nazareth
 would be executed. You know, and 
there was something of that. But it Œ my cous
in, my Œ my Œ my cousin also, he was a 
Catholic priest, had no hostility against the Je
ws as such. He was also interested and 
fascinating i-in relationship and in Œ in 
the common heritage with the Jews. So, I 
don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Well Œ 
Q: Okay . I Œ I Œ I wanted to get a sense of the nature of th ese type Œ with th Œ th e 
nature, the Œ the questions that 
were Œ that were raised, and Œ 

A: In my family, I Œ I would say there wa
s not mu ch religious or ethnical prejudice 
against neither the Jews, nor 
Germans, except the Poles. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Somehow in my family, th
e Poles, th-they just Œ they  just couldn™t stand them. 
Q: And why not? Wh y do think that was the case? 
A: Because of the Œ of the Œ of this whol
e relationship which re-resulted in the Polish 
army seizin g the capital of 
Lithuania, Vilnius
.  
Q: I see. 

A: And my father was at that time in th
e Lithuanian army, and my mother was in 
Vilnius
 in Œ in the foreign industry of 
Lithua nia ,
 had to flee from the advancing 
Polish army , and you know, th-the Œ 
th-they took it personally, really.

A: Right. 
Q: Something like that. 

A: Right. 
Q: What kind of a place was 
Panev
¡
žy s
? If we talk about Œ you know, I asked about 
Taurag
¡
, what was its make-up, 
how would you describe 
Panev
¡
žy s
? How 
different, or similar? Wh-What Œ what was this place? 
A: For Œ for me it was Œ it was different. And I came from 
Taurag
¡
 
and I felt 
superior, because it seemed to me like it™
s mu ch less sophisticated city, mu ch less 
sophitis Œ sophisticated school, and much  less sophisticated friends I had in my scho 

Œ in my school, you know?  
Q: Mm-hm.

A: So I felt, you know Œ you know, a loss of 
Taurag
¡
, you know? The interesting 
sophisticated city. Now, there were Œ th
ere were some Germans in Œ in pen Œ in
 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
but really few of them. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There were some P o les, there some Ru
ssians, which didn Œ we didn™t have in 
Taurag
¡
. So  ethnic Œ ethnic Œ you know, was co
mpletely different. There were a lot 
of Jews in Œ in Œ in  
Panev
¡
žy s
, and there was a very small community, but 
influential, and a community of 
Karayims
. 
Q: Tell us what are 
Ka ray ims
. Who are they? 
A: 
Karayims
 are Œ it seems like they are of Tu
rk ish descent. Their language is 
similar to Turkish language. Racially they 
look like, you know, lik
e Turk s or Tartars, 
but religiously they are Jews. They are 
Jews, but they  do not accept the talmu Œ 
Talmudic Judaism. They just accept Torah. 

Q: I see. 
A: And refuse to co Œ you 
know, to accept any other au
thorities outside of Torah, 
any you know, rabbi™s interpretations, 
Talmudian [indecipherable]
, they just reject 
that. 

Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

39
A: And the Jews consider them
 co Œ you know, ra Œ I think th at Jews didn™t consider 
them really  Jews at all. Th
ey dom Œ do not consider th
emselves rabbinical Jews. Th-
There is a hoso Œ there was so
me hostility between Jews and 
Ka rayims. 
Q: And yet they were in  
Lithuania
. They somehow or other had Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ arrived there, come there. 

A: Well, they were brought here, ye Œ to 
Lithuania, 
all this Œ going through old Œ 
old history, but 
Lithuania ™s
 ruler, 
Vytautas
 the Great Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Œ on his Œ wh en he was ruling 
Lithuania
, 
Lithuania
 was really an empire 
because took a lot of territory up to the 
Black
 Sea, and he went to the 
Crimea
, and 
in 
Crimea
 there was that 
Karayim 
community. And he brought
 several families, I 
think 40 or more
 families to 
Lithuania
 with th e purpose that they would be his 
personal guard. 
Q: Oh. 
A: You see, they™re outside. They™re comple
te outsiders. They  just rely on th e grand 
dukes of 
Lithuania
 and he i-is guarding them. He 
couldn™t trust Lithuanian s because 
there were, you know, well, there were some
 of his friends, but there was friends of 
his cousin, who was his rival, and a
ll that kind of thing. The cris Œ 
Lithuania
 was 
becoming Christian, there were still old pa
gans, who didn™t like the ca Œ so he Œ he

thought that he™d better rely on the pe
ople who nobody could even  communicate 
with at the beginning. Well la
ter they learned, of course
, Lithuanian language, but Œ 
but still, they were Œ and they 
worship his memory even now. 
Q: I see.  
A: Because they Œ 

Q: 500 Œ 600 years later.  

A: Yes. And they were living in  
Trakai
 where 
Vytautas
 was mostl y  residing and 
they had, you know, the duty 
to Œ to protect the castle, go 
to  the guard duty in castle. 
Q: So there was thi Œ such a sm all but influential commu nity in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 as well? 
A: Right. 
Q: Okay . 
A: How they  came to 
Panev
¡

, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Because they were di Œ  
Q: Describe just a little bit about your high
 school years. What kind of a high school 
was it, and Œ 
A: Really, really, my first 
impression was wrong, the hi
gh school was very good, 
you know, and co mp ared with 
other Lithuanian high schools was wa Œ ca Œ was not 
the first, maybe Œ well, of course 
it wasn™t the first, the first was 
[in d ecipherable]
 
the most ad-advanced. But Œ 
but it was a very good sc
hool, and had very good

teachers, and Œ in most of the subjects. 
And the people were friendly, and so I 
enjoyed that Œ that, very mu ch, you know. 
I was a poor student, because my  father 
send me to grammar school one year earlier. 
Usually i-it started at seven, he sent me 
at six. And I was not a good student, neither in 
Ta ura g
¡
, 
nor in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, until the 
fi Œ my fifth class, fifth year class where 
I w-was left for a year, you know, to repeat 
the course in Œ in th at school, because my
 mathematics we-were not good. Of course 
I was also sick, I missed classes, and so  I wa
s le Œ let to repeat the course in the Œ in 
the first ye Œ fifth year. And that helped 
me a lot. After that I became  a good su Œ 
student. So my father overestimated me. I was 
just an average, exactly as Œ as Œ I am 
Œ I am not Œ  
Q: As you were supposed to be. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. And do you remember what kind of
 atmosphere there was 
in these Œ 30™s, in 
this town, 
Panev
¡
žy s
, about how many people did it have at that time? Was it Œ yes, 
it was a city I believe you told  me. 

A: Yeah, ab out to Œ I would say, 30,000 maybe. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Maybe more, yeah. 
Q: And Œ 

A: Or it will be more, would be mo
re, m-may b e 40,000, close to 50.

Q: Okay . 
A: Something like that. 

Q: So in Œ in those terms for such a small co untry it™s not inconsequential.  
A: 
[indecipherable]
 yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. What Œ what do you remember
 from those high school years, both 
personally, and what was going on in the 
wider society? What kind of discussions, 
what kind of events? 

A: Well, it was rather quiet year
s until Œ until the situation in 
Lithuania
 became 
dangerous, and the first ultimatum, the 
Polish ultimatum came
 through, you know, 
and then the people are aware that the coun
try is in danger. And th en, of course, was 
a lot of discussion and concern, and taki
ng positions and such 
like Œ like that. But 
general Œ the relationship between 
nationalities Œ well, I said taura Œ 
Taurag
¡
 
there 
were no Œ no Œ no hostility. While in 
Panev
¡
žys 
definitely there was, because there 
was a Polish gymnasium also. 

Q: I see.  
A: And there were Poles in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s,
 and that was already the host Œ 
ho-hostile element, because they were cons
idered disloyal to Lithuanian state. 
Maybe they were not, but the 
Lithuanians looked at them 
thi Œ with Œ with su spicion 
that they might be disloyal.

Q: Were there any Œ were there incidents th
at would have fed into this, or was this 
just the general accep
ted point of view? 
A: No, th ere were no particular incidents, 
but there were na Œ th Œ our Œ the young 
people, the teenagers, Lithua
nian, Polish, we didn™t fight
 or anything like that, but 
we ignored each other, mostly.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Sometimes I had some discussion with them, but discussions Œ 
Q: Did you know anybody 
personally who were Œ 
A: Oh, I met one of them, but no, no, no,
 I didn™t have any friends in there. 
Q: Uh-huh. The Œ and in Œ can 
you repeat just a little bit,
 if it would be Œ or Œ or 
explain just a little bit, what™s the essenc
e, it was a Œ was it th-the takeover of 
Vilnius
 that was the reason why there was this 
friction, or was there something mo re 
to it, was it a broader, deeper, longer lasting Œ 
A: Well, we Œ we Œ we had the su spicion 
that the Poles generally were against the 
Lithuanian state. That we
 Œ they wanted to recrea
te the PolishLithuanian 
commonwealth. But in the modern times we 
were susp Œ sus Œ suspecting that they 
just wanted a Œ to annex 
Lithuania
 and Œ and that™s all.  
Q: I see. 

A: And we felt that they denied, you know, 
the Lithuanians, in 
their mind that they 
were denying our right as Œ as a nation to 
keep our own state with our own capital, 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

44
historical capital. And that Œ that was 
the hostility. Now, it was quite clear I never, 
you know, th Œ even  though
t about that, that between 
Lithuanians and Poles Œ b-
between the young people, the teenagers wh
o went to different gymnasium, that 
between those gymnasiums there were no Œ no
 relationship really. But I don™t know 
why there was no relationship with the Je
wish j Œ schools which were in Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There were no relations. We had some Je
ws who went to Lithuanian school, and 
wa Œ by class, you know, classmates. But Œ 
and we were fine, we were friends, we 
were o-okay . Bu t the relationship betwee
n the Jewish gy-gymnasium and Po land Œ 
and Lithuanian gymn asium was just nonexi
stent. And I don™t know at Œ even now I 
couldn™t explain why it was so, because th ere was no such hostility at all, and 
Lithuanians considered Jews, you know, the Je
ws also supported Lithuanian claim to 

Vilnius
 usually, the great ma jority, I wouldn™t know about all but ye Œ th-the great 
majority was supporting th at. And they 
[indecipherable] Lithuania
 recovered 
Vilnius
, the Jewish community was Œ was quite friendly, and wh -while the Polish, of 
course, people were very hostile.  
Q: So, let™s take Œ let™s start with the year
s that Œ le-let™s go up to  these years where 
things start to get tense. And you™re sayi
ng the first one was when  Œ had to do with 
the Polish Lithuanian relationship?

45
A: Right, 19 eight Œ 
Q: What happened? 

A: Œ 1938, the 
Œ Poland  
demanded that 
Lithuania
 take up th e diplomatic and Œ and 
economic rel-relations with 
Poland
, which would Œ 
Q: Which it hadn™t had until Œ 

A: Which 
Lithuania
 didn™t have after Œ after 
Vilnius
, you know, was like a 
completely Œ there were co
mplete Œ complete l Œ l 
Œ no communication between 
Lithuania
 and 
P o la nd. 
Q: And 
Viln ius 
had been occupied  or taken over 
at what Œ what year? It was Œ  
A: 1920. 
Q: Nineteen Œ so for 18 years ther
e had been  no diplomatic relations? 
A: Right, right, and the Poles demanded 
and demanded, you kn
ow, with ultimatum. 
That means, if not, there would be war. 
Q: I see. 
A: And 
Lith uania
 accepted that. The Pole
s didn™t require that 
Lithuania
 renounce 
Vilnius
 as a Œ or Œ or renounce, y
ou know, Lithuanian  claim to 
Vilnius. 
It didn™t 
mention 
Vilnius
 at all. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It mentioned the relations
hip. But still Lithuanians felt 
that it was demeaning, that 
it was Œ

46
Q: Why do you think th at they even Œ 
1938 would have been mo tivated by it? 
A: Well, we suspected that they
 always want to take over 
Lithuania
 eventually. 
That™s one thing. But at that time, 
Poland
 considers itself a great power in 
Euro pe
 
and 
Germ any
 just took over 
Austria
 and 
Poland
 wanted  comp en sation as a great 
power, you know, so at least, you know, 
they Œ they to ok th
is step against 
Lithuania
 
to showing that they ar
e also Œ can act, you know. 
Q: So this was the Œ this was how it was perceived basically, in Œ in 
Panev
¡
žys
, in 
Lithuania
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Yes. And Œ and it is right. No w we k
now, you know, the back
grounds and so, and 
basically that was Œ what was

 at that time.

 we should change

Beginning Tape Two 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Mr. 
Algimantas Gurecka s
 on October 14
th
, 2010. Mr. 
Gureckas,
 I 
wanted to  continue our Œ our 
discussion about Œ about the ri
sing tensions in
 Œ in your 
world, in 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
in 
Lithuania
. And we were talk
ing about the Polish 
Lithuanian relationship. As 
you™re speaking, I™m thinking
, how mu ch of this did a 15 
year old boy know, because that™s how old 
you were in 1938; ho
w much of this was 
discussed at home? How mu ch 
do you Œ can you rememb er 
that you knew of it at the 
time? 
A: Well, a lot, a lot. It affected everyb
ody, affected my  family, you know, and so 
also affected me. I also felt, you know, th
at Po les were Œ were trying, you know, 
somehow, you know, to show 
our superior Œ their Œ their 
superior powers, or their 
superior might against a smaller country, 
and didn™t like it. Didn™t like it at all. 
Although I was skeptical 
at that time about 
Vilnius
, you know. I thought well, you 
know, we are no-not going to recover 
Viln ius
 ever. I didn™t tell anybody not Œ not 
that my father, nor Œ nor my mother, nor Œ 
nor my friends. But I 
thought wow, that™s 
Œ that™s an unrealistic, we might as well fo
rget about it. Bu t Œ but this was then a 
Polish ultimatum, the Polish de
mand, you know. It still hurt. Still hurt very much, 
you know. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
48
Q: I want to also kind of make a remark is
, as I™m listening to y
ou, you™re saying th at 
these events, which are political Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ in nature, which are intra-government
al, nevertheless affected your family a 
great deal, and I take it to mean affected in
 a sense of not in a personal way that their 
lives changed from one day to the next. 
A: Right. 
Q: But their feelings, their Œ their s Œ thei
r senses and so on were
 affect Œ and that 
speaks to me of Œ of people who we
re engaged in a civic process. 
A: Right. 

Q: Because there could have been  people wh
o live in a country , as there are today in 
the 
United States, 
and as there are all over the world Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ who Œ whose world consists of, I go to
 work in the mornin
g, I do my  job, I 
come home, I have no interest in Œ in po
litics, or in what goes around me. I can™t 
affect it anyway, and what happens in 
Wa shington, 
what happens in
 Moscow
, is 
none of my affair, okay? And clearly that 
was not the dynamic going on in the cir Œ 

in the Œ in the circle of people 
that you grew  up with. Is that so? 
A: That™s true. That™s true, I Œ I Œ I s Œ I 
Œ I am sure that ther
e were such people, 
such people are disinterested in Œ in Œ in 
politics, interethnic relationships, and so I 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
49
am sure there were so, but that was not in 
our Œ in Œ in our circle, in  our family, in 
the friends m-my family had. 
Q: And why would you Œ ho
w would you explain their engagement then? Ho w 
would you explain th eir 
engagement
 
to events that really are outside and beyond 
their personal lives? By that Œ still at that 
point, I mean at some point history doesn™t 
im-imp act, but how would yo
u explain this interest? 
A: In Œ in  such a Œ well, as I mentioned 
befo re, you know, the Œ the family history, 
the people Œ the Œ my father™s
 experience i-in Œ in Œ in Œ 
in the War of Independence, 
and before that he was in 
Poland
 during th e World War I, you know, an-and the 
relationship even during that tsarist tim
es, even in their gy
mn asiu m, th ere was 
already hostility between the Lithuanians and 
Poles in their classe
s, he told me. So 
that Œ 

Q: I™m asking not so mu
ch about that particular relati
onship, but in Œ in a Œ I guess 
mo re direct way would say, why should 
your parents care what goes on between
 
Kaunas 
and 
Wa rsa w,
 or 
Kaunas 
and 
Mo scow
, or 
Ka una s
 and 
Berlin
? It™s ha Œ 
you know, what made your fa
mily engaged in caring abou
t these political events, in 
general. Why would you Œ 
how would you explain it? 
A: I Œ I don™t know, I don™t know. But I 
know that even my 
grandfather from my  
mother™s side, even he 
was very committed to the Lithuanian national Œ 
Q: Idea. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
50
A: Œ and ethnic ideal, right. He was worki
ng he Œ with  them, he Œ he Œ he was 
helping during the 1905, 1905
 there was a revolution in 
Russia
, and in 
Lithuania
 it 
took a national character; Lithuanians agai
nst the Russian suppression. So , why Œ my  
father hid, you know, the Œ the 
revolutionaries Œ my  grandfather. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: My mother found out, I 
mean, that he hid the revolutionaries who were trying to  
get Œ wh en Œ wh en th e revolution wa
s suppressed, trying to get into 
Germany
 and 
later maybe to 
United States 
to escape from that pole Œ 
tsarist oppression. So, you 
know, it™s tradition going way b
ack. And I don™t know how to
 explain. It was a small 
country, and the fe Œ people felt that, you kn
ow, these things rea
lly affect them. The 
country™s independence was precarious duri
ng th at time, and of course, I mean, my  
father was working for the government, so i-
if Œ if Œ if the country  is occupied, I 
mean, he has no job. I think maybe that al
so had something to do. I Œ really, we 
didn™t pose those questions th
at way, so I am not sure.  
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: That™s what it seems to me, but Œ 

Q: The other question that comes to mind, an
d again th is is in Œ in my  mind an irony 
because I wouldn™t Œ I™m not as
 familiar with the history 
at the time, is why would 
Poland
 be someone you™d be Œ th
ere would be mo re of such negative feelings about 
than the 
Sov i et Unio n
, which is right next door? What Œ well, so is
 Pola nd, 
but Œ 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
51
but what kind of disc
ussions were going on, 
what kind of sensib
ility was there about 
the 
Soviet Unio n? 
What role did that play in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, you know, and what was 
going on? What did you know of
 what was going on in Soviet
 Russia
, and the union 
itself? 
A: We knew some, we knew the Œ you know
, my ma Œ my f Œ my father see the 

beginnings of the Ru ssian revolution in  
Russia
. I would say so. Ag ain, the Po lish 
thing. 
Soviet Union
 was supporting 
Lithuania
 in this Polish Lithuanian conflict. Or 
supporting 
Lithuania™s
 claim to
 Vilnius
. 
Q: All along? 

A: All along. The only one of the great 
powers. The Germans also didn™t recognize 
the Polish 
annextion
 of
 Vilnius
, but the Germans were not
 willing to, you know, to 
take stand, or support
 Lithuania
 or something like th at. So they  kept mo re or less 
outside of that Œ of that issue. The 
Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan
 supported 
Poland
. So the only great power supporting Œ 
United States
 were behind the area, 
you know, they didn™t Œ it was time of isola
tion, they didn™t Œ tried not to take any 

stance in European affairs at all. 
S o  the only real power supporting
 Lithuania
 was 
Soviet Unio n
. Now, my  parents, being good Ca
tholics and Lithuanians, they 
disapproved of the communist system as su
ch. But there was little discussion of that, 
you know, all of the memo ries
 of revolution as my  father
 said, I mean he thought 
that revolution was, of course, a cruel peri
od of time. A lot of things happened , but 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
52
he thought that, you know, after all this ti
me , there was some Œ some normali ty in 
the country. Even  he didn't wanted to be
lieve that there was a constant terror or 
something like that. Although
, you know, w-we read about 
the terror in Œ against so-
called, you know, the Œ the short trials
 of the c Œ other communists against
 Stalin
, 
and Œ 
Q: You read that in the Lithuanian media? 

A: Yes, yes, that was Œ so di Œ that was lo
oked Œ people didn™t believe really that all 
those people, you know, were traitors or 
something like that, and there was going a 
struggle for power. But as far as 
Lithuania
 is concerned, that was outside of our real 
concerns.  
Q: And did news of the famine in the 
Ukraine
, was there anything like that that Œ 
that touched your Œ 
A: N-No t Œ we didn™t know a thing about it, no. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Noth ing at all. 
Q: In the 30s, as this was Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay, okay. So Œ 
so in other words, from what I 
get Œ a sense I get from you is 
the Soviet
 Russia,
 or 
Soviet Unio n 
was rather benign in it Œ in a Œ in a Œ 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
53
A: That Œ that was our Œ our impression, mo
-most of pre Œ impression of my  parents, 
of the people they Œ they befriended, they 
discussed those things, yes, that was Œ that 
did p Œ it was, you know, 
a Œ was supporting us. 
Q: Okay . 
A: For our right cause, we imagined
 that the Lithuanian cause was Œ 
Q: The right one. 

A: Œ a right cause, so Œ 
Q: So, what happens after 
1938? We™re finished with 
Poland. Poland
 requires this 
ultimatums Œ says this ultim
atum, requires diplomatic re
lations. Everybody™s upset, 
but they acquiesce.  

A: Right. 
Q: What happens then? 

A: Well, the next year the Germans demanded
 
the 
Klaip
¡
da 
area. 
Q: Mm-hm. And? 
A: Well, that was another shock. You know,

the refugees we met. The Jewish people,

people. And there were appeals, you know, 
that Œ you know, for living space, for 
other things, for jobs for those refugees. So
 my  parents decided, you know, that we 
had a nice house, it was our ow
n house. We have too mu ch 
space, we can Œ we could 
rent, you know, the upstairs,
 you know, to somebody. And 
we rent it to a girl who 
came from
 Klaip

 as a refugee, and well, simp ly, we Œ he Œ she work ed in  Œ in Œ 
in 
Misetas

Q: 
Misetas

A: As a clerk, you know, as 
a clerk, you know, so th-that 
was a refu gee, we came to 
our Œ to our house. And there 
were more those refugees, one of my father™s Œ th-the 
legal students who were taking practi
ce with my father
 was also fr om 
Lithuania 
Minor
, an d he came, you know, to wo rk th ere, 
so we me t him directly, and of course 
the Jewish people took care of the Jewish refugees Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ you know, who came from 
Klaip
¡
da
. 
Q: Okay, so wa Œ so  it was still sort of se
parate communities, it was not an integrated 
sense of these are all Lithuanian citizens, 
but it was mo re, each takes care of its own. 
A: Right. 
Q: It just happens naturally like that. 
A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: Okay .

A: Yeah. 
Q: And who was this girl who came from
 Klaip
¡
da
? Did you talk to her? 
A: Yeah, shu Œ  
Q: Did she tell you about wh at had been 
goin g on there, and what she saw, and 
things like that? 
A: Yeah, yeah, she did. 

Q: What did she say? 
A: She Œ she was not from the Œ that area. She was from l Œ from 
Lithuania
, she was 
Catholic, you know, Lithua
nian  Œ Lithuanians from 
Lithuania Minor
 are usually 
Lutherans. She ca Œ when a 
young girl she came to 
Klaip
¡
da
 to work there. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And now she became a refugee, beca
use she Œ she lived fo r years there, you 
know, and Œ and came back. So
 she told, you know, about the Œ the Nazis, how they 

acted there, you know, how th
ey at-attacked Lithuanians 
and Lithuanian institutions. 
They became more an d more, you know, aggr
essive as the time went on, until it was, 
you know, really a problem for the Lithuani
an even to exist th
ere. TheNazis were 
trying to , you know, to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to  
dominate that area at 
all, and of course, you 
know, they demanded 
Klaip
¡
da
 for 
Germany
, and 
Lithuania
 couldn™t resist, and 
you know, they Œ th ey just had 
to flee that Œ that country. 
Hitler

Klaip
¡
da
, you know, and well, was 
a very sad moment for 
Lithuania
, but we felt 
that™s Œ it was a superior Œ superior
 power, couldn™t do mu ch about it.  
Q: Were there any people that you knew of in 
Lithuania
 who were Lithuanians who 
supported 
Hitler
? Who thought that the i Œ that th
e ideology of the Nazi party was 
one that had some positive attributes? 
A: Ye-es, yes, but not in our circle, in our
 family circle. The closest I know was our 
Catholic priest, a teach er of religion in 
our school. He was im
pressed by the order 
and discipline of the Nazi movement, a
nd during the lessons, you know, sometimes 
he made 
Germany
 Œ the Nazi 
Germany
 as an example of, you know, of a 
disciplined, purposeful society. But that 
was really ther Œ we heard about other 
people, you know, who Œ who were f-friendly 
to Germans, but there were very, very 
few of them, because 
Lithuania
 was under direct attack at that time, with 
Klaip
¡
da .
 
Everybody was very sad that 
Klaip
¡
da
 was lost. 
Q: Okay . What Œ an d you were
, by th at point, 16 years old? 

A: Right.  
Q: And how Œ is your life ch
anging at all? I mean, your 
personal life, do things keep 
on going the way they  should be
, even in sp ite of these Œ 
A: Yes, yes. It didn™t Œ my  personal lif
e didn™t in Œ didn™t change m Œ at all. 
Q: What happened next
, that you rememb er?

A: Well, the next thing was that summer, 
1939, from ow Œ ou-our school, there was 
an excursion to 
Vilnius
, because the diplomatic rela
tions were established, the 
communications were already established, 
you know, we could Œ we could go to 
Vilnius
, you know, to visit the 
city. So  my  Œ my  school decided to  have an 
excursion. So, I to Œ my pare
nts, you know, agreed that th
ey had to  pay some money, 
I don™t know, for that, but they
 agreed that I go on that ex
cursion, and I went with a 
group of my  classmates to Œ to 
Viln ius
. And it made a great impression on me, the 
city. The great impression of the old Lithua
nian history connected to the city, where 
there were signs all around. The Lithuanian
 coat of arms, you know, was on th e city 
gate. Ancient. 
Q: There was a Œ there was a Œ 
still a city ga
te in 1939? 
A: One. One. Yeah, one was Œ because 
Auıros
 
Vartai
, it wou Œ had Œ it had the 
chapel, had some religious me
aning, so it Œ the gate was not demo lished, all other 
gates were. 

Q: 
Auıros Vartai
 means in English, Gates of Dawn, yes? 
A: Gates of Dawn Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ but I think it was Lithuanian mistranslation 
auıros,
 it should be 
aus-
austrayo
(ph), I think where Œ meant Œ 
Q: Okay .

58
A: Œ well, it™s Œ now it
 Auıros Vartai
, so whatever. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So, but Œ but an-anywh ere el
se, at the churches, at the bridges, we could see our Œ 
the coat of arms of our country. The old 
ones. Of course, the new offices had Polish 
signs, but nothing has Œ did Œ as far as
 history Œ well, there was some in 
combination, when th
e co-countries Œ was a Polish-
Lithuanian commonwealth while 
the countries were united 
in one commonwealth, there 
was a Œ also a no Œ Po lish 
eagle, Lithuanian knight, and so  on, you 
know, bi Œ from those times. But always, 
always the Lithuanian knight. And 
[indecipherable] 
thing, and so Lithuanian 

students met our excursion, and he was a lead
er of our excursion, so the city told 
about how Lithuanians lived u
nder the Poles, you know, a
nd we went to Lithuanian 
s-s Œ girls™ school, the girls Œ the Œ it wa
s summer , so t h e girls went home, so the 
school was empty, so Œ but they acco
mmodated us. So we were Œ we still in 
Vilnius
 
were in mi dst of the Lithuanian  community 
there, which was very small, and really 
oppressed, but they  were prou
d because they felt that they
 were oppressed, and they 
were right that there was something wrong
, you know, with the Polish government, 
that they Œ they were oppre
ssing the Lithuanians anyways. 
Q: Did th ey have their own schools, 
though, Lithuanian language schools in
 Poland, 
or Œ or you don™t know about that?

A: Yeah, they Œ they had some, but there 
were Œ one of the Œ the other were, they 
closing those schools, and they
 had the one high school in 
Vilnius
 itself.  
Q: Okay . 
A: Just the only one. There were bef Œ 
many mo re before, but 
they were closed. 
Q: Okay .  
A: But in 
Vilnius
 there was one. 
Q: So in  some ways this 1939 summer 
excursion is both an Œ something new, 
because you get to see the city 
for the first time in your life. 
A: Right. 
Q: And it™s a summer vacation, and it™s positive. 
A: Right. 
Q: And it™s Œ it™s something that you see of 
Œ that you can relate 
to and identify with. 
And at the same time it™s the summer of 1939. 

A: Right. 
Q: Which is not exactly a summer without tension. 
A: Oh yeah, in
 Vilnius
 was Œ in
 Lithuania
 that was not that obvious, but in 
Vilnius
, 
yes. 
Q: How did you feel it in 
Vilnius
? 
A: Well, there were Œ there were all po Œ oh,
 th ere™s su-such like Œ 
first of all, there 
were military demonstrations of the Poles.
 There were parades. We were, you know, 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
60
looking at one of the parades i-in 
Vilnius
, of artillery regiment there, and we were 
comparing that because ther
e was artillery regiment in
 Panev
¡
žy s 
also. So we were 
comp aring how it is and we looked, you kn
ow, boy, our soldiers look mu ch  mo re, 
you know, mu ch better, better cl
othes, better Œ and didn™t impr
ess us as Œ at all. But 
there were also the signs all over the 
Vilnius
 that Œ in Polish Œ that we are not going 
to retreat from our seashore. 
And they were Œ they were 
ready to fight. They we Œ 
knew the war is comin g , or at least suspecte
d the war is coming, and they Œ they are 

not going like the Czechs or
 Lithuanians who gave up
 Klaip
¡
da
, or th e Czechs who 
gave up th e 
Sudetenland
, they are going to fight. They 
are not going to  give in to 
the Nazis Œ to the Œ Nazis they didn™t
 mention that, just
 to the Germans. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, so Œ so it was obvi
ous, the war is coming.  
Q: To you? 

A: Which was not obvious in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 Œ 
Q: And 
Panev
¡
žy s
 is two hours away. 
A: Yes, but this was quite, you know, quite
 my  place. And here
, you know Œ and we 
met one Polish girl, who was just gradua
ted from Œ from the hi
gh school and was 
visiting her relatives in  
Vilnius
, and we talked with he
r, you know, and beca Œ she 
was very friendly, we talk
ed in German with her. 
Q: Mm-hm.

61
A: And she knew German, and she knew, you 
know, that the war is coming, but he Œ 
she didn™t think, you know, about all thos
e horrible things. So 
Œ so what, you know? 
What Œ what are the Germans going to  
do to me, you know? Well, nothing, you 
know. It doesn™t matter, you know, so Œ 
Q: Well, this is somewhat of what I was 
getting at earlier, is that, y ou know, some 

people say wa Œ some people will say,
 there™s all this high politics going on. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How does it touch me, a simp le person? 
A: Well, for that girl, didn™t touch it.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Sh Œ she didn™t care.
 I am sure, I mean Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ it touched her terribly, even tually. 

Q: Yes, yeah. 
A: And pretty soon. Just a few mo nths.  
Q: Yeah. So  this is where you started to 
feel that there™s something going on, in Œ 
when you went on th
is summer excursion to
 Vilnius
? 
A: Yes, it changed my  opinion. As I said, 
I was skeptical about 
Lithuanian claim to 
Vilnius
 because it™s Œ it might be right, but it 
seemed too unrealistic to me. But after 
this excursion I changed 
my opinion completely.

62
Q: In what way?  
A: In what way? That this i Œ that™s what
 the Lithuanian capita
l is. I mean, the Poles 
took it over, but that™s Œ that™s what it Œ 
the capital is. T h at™s what the Lithuanian 
law says, that™s what™s Lithuanian 
constitution said. The capital city of 
Vilnius
 is 
Lithuania™s
 capital. S o  Œ and I thought that™s
 right. That™s what it is. Maybe Œ 
maybe we d-don™t recover the 
Vilnius, 
I don™t know, you know, but Œ 
Q: Also, before then Œ 
A: Œ but then, doesn™t change. 
Q: Œ you had e Œ you had Œ before then, 
you hadn™t necessarily been convinced of 
this argument.  
A: That™s right. 
Q: But at that point, once you went there 
and you saw these signs, that these were Œ 
that there was so much th
at was of Lithuanian Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ history there, and Lithuanian presence 
there, that yes, it is Œ it is the rightful 
capital.  
A: That™s right.

Q: What happens after that? You know, 
there™s the summer, and then September 
first come s. September first is 
not that long after your summer Œ 

A: Right, right. 
Q: Œ excu rsion. So , how did events play out? What happened back in  
Panev
¡
žy s
, 
once you returned from the trip? 
A: Yeah, first of all, as far as I am c
oncerned, a lot of people, starting with my  
family, with my father and 
more my m-mother, were very
 much interested in my 
experience, in my Œ 

Q: Ah. 

A: Œ and even the people who Œ who we
re friendly with our family, the other 
families also were very much intere
sted in that experience. Nobody saw 
Vilnius
 for 
19 years, and now suddenly , y
ou know, I saw that Œ that 
city, and everybody wanted 
Œ and even  Lithuanian officers were intere
ste d , in my opinion 
how did the Polish 
army  look to  me? You know, and all th
at kind of thing, 
you know. I was Œ 
Q: You were pretty much the hero . 

A: Œ a center of attention. 

Q: Yes. 
A: Th Œ that Œ I Œ I was just Œ 
Q: That™s not bad. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

64
A: No, no, well, I Œ I was just so Œ so pr
oud, you know. Not so 
proud, but I tried to 
be, you know, contro lled about it, 
but I felt very well about that. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, that I had that ex
perience. And then suddenly in 
[indecipherable]
 th-
the Œ the vacation was ending, but the scho
ol didn™t start yet. School starts on 
September the first. B u t the week before I went to the gymnasium, I don™t know 
why, I met some of my friends and there, 
you know, I found out 
before Œ before the 
newspapers came out, or somethi
ng like th at, I found out about 
Ribbentrop-
Molo tov 
agreement. 
Q: And what was the militor Œ 
Molotov-Ribb entrop 
agreement? 
A: Well, it was that they committ
ed themselves, both countries Œ 
Q: Who were these countries? 

A: 
Germany
 and 
Soviet Union
 committed themselves not 
to fight against each 
other, even in a c Œ in a cong Œ if the conf
lict with a third countr
ies c o mes, that t h ey 
wouldn™t be involved, they wo
uld keep neutrality in that 
conf-conflict. So, since we 
knew that there were discussions betwee
n British and French 
and the Soviets, ho-
how to stand up against German ag-aggre
ssion, sudden ly this disappeared, you 
know, suddenly 
Sov iets Union 
said no, we are not going to make a stand. And the 
British and French, you know, just Œ just
 went home. That was the whole power 
situation. And th e people thought that
 if there would be agreement between 
Great 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

65
Britain, France
 and the 
Soviet Union
, that there would be
 no war, because the 
superiority of this combination 
should have been clear even to 
Hitler
. So they 
thought, that™s it. 
Q: So are these discussions, you know, I Œ it 
still is hard for me 
to imagine that a 16 
Œ by now 16 year old boy Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ is thinking like this at that time. What
 I can imagine is that a 16 year old boy is 
listening to grown-ups talk 
like this at that time.  
A: That™s right, but af-after Œ after visit to 
Vilnius
 I became political. 
Q: I see. 

A: Before that, I Œ yeah, I heard th Œ I wa
s interested in those things, but you know, 
not Œ not that mu ch. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But ah Œ ah Œ at that poi
nt, you know, I became Œ I be 
Œ really interested in what 
was going on. 

Q: So when you her Œ hear, a week from sc
hool Œ befo re school starts, that there is 
this 
Molotov-Ribb entrop
 pact Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ and you Œ you go to, where was it, your
 school area, even though it hadn™t 
begun, is this where you learned of it?

Q: From your friends. 

A: From my friends, yeah. 
Q: Your friends. And your 
friends are your same a Œ they Œ ab out the same age? 
A: Yeah, the same age. Well,
 they heard on the radio or something, but they , also 
their parents. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Their parents. I Œ we Œ we started discu
ssing, I said no, so wh
at, I mean, so what? 
There is no wars on, does it matter much
? And my friend said, you know, well, my 
father said that, you know, this means 
war. Because, you know, the Germans were 
ma Œ will be not d-deterred by the superi
or power of three great countries, 
Great 
Britain, France
 and 
Soviet Un ion. 
So that means the war is
 comi ng. That was his

[inaudible]
 
Q: And you™re sharing it with yo
ur si Œ we Œ amongst yourselves Œ 
A: That™s right.

A: That™s right. 
Q: Okay . 
A: That™s all Œ so we Œ we didn™t deduct ourselves really  Œ 

Q: Okay .

A: From our parents. 
Q: All right, so this is a Œ 
A: In this case my friend™s parent, mm-hm. 

Q: So here we are. 

A: All right. 
Q: It™s a week before September first. 
A: Right. 

Q: And then  what happens? 
A: And then  the school started September fi
rst, and the war started, of course, and 
that was news, and everybody was liste
ning to the radio, and ev erybody was 
following what™s going on, an
d quite soon it was clear, yo
u know, o-of the German 
superiority, which we thought ev en befo re. 
I didn™t see it, but other people saw the 
German army in 
Klaip
¡
da . 
We saw Polish army in Œ in 
Vilnius
, and it was obvious, 
you know, that the Germans were mu ch be
tter prepared, and mu
ch stronger army 
than the Poles, and even before the war st
arted, we thought that the Poles are going 
to lose the war. And of course, we Œ we kids, you know, were, because of that 

hostility with the Poles, we thought 
that™s Œ that™s a nice time for 
Lithuania
 to 
recover
 Viln ius
. The Germans are attacking 
Poland
 and pole Œ Polish army  

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

definitely is losing, like in the first days
 it was quite obvious a German attack was, 
you know, the 
Blitzkrieg. 
They Œ they went very, very
 strongly wi-with air Œ air 
attacks, armored formations. So we thou
ght well, you know, why Lithuanian army  
doesn ™t go th ere and recover 
Vilnius
, because Poles will be not able to resist an y 
more. 

Q: Was there any sentiment of changing,
 I mean any voices amongst Lithuanians 

that said well, maybe we didn™t like the Po les very much for what
 they did, but my  
God, wh at™s happening in 
Poland,
 and it™s terrible? Was that Œ was there any 
symp athy being expressed in the so Œ in
 those circles that you were in, of 
Poland™s 
getting it now, and it™s Œ it™s not easy? 
A: Not in the those circles I was in. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Not in my co Œ friends, classmates, no. 
Not in my family. But,
 our director of-of 
our school told us Germans are not going to  win this war. It is world war, and the 
Germans are going to lo se, and we shouldn™t 
interfere in the war now. He didn™t say 
that, you know, he Œ he simp  Œ in symp athy 
with Poles or something. Maybe he was, 
I don™t know. But he was convinced that 
the Nazis are going to  lose. And it seems 
like not some kind of a military or Œ or 
Œ or economical anal
ysis, but because the 
Nazi ideology, that generation knew Germ
ans from the first oc
cupation during the 
first World War. And they were convinced th
at the Germans were always overdoing. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

69
Q: Overreaching themselves? 
A: Overreaching. In the first World War, an
d from the Nazi ideolo
gy they deducted 
that the Nazis are ric Œ rea
dy to do the same thing, to
 overreach more, even more 
than the Œ during the fi
rst World War. So they we
re Œ and our president, 
Antana s 
Smetona
 also was of that opinion. Some of th
e officers of Lithuanian army, some o-
of the diplomats said, I mean
, it™s a chance to recover 
Vilnius
, let™s go, and Germans 
were encouraging Lithuanians, en
courag ing, you know, that wil Œ 
Lithuania
 wil Œ 
would go and recover 
Vilnius
. And the British said, in that case, 
G reat Britain 
will 
declare war against 
Lithuania
. But well, now this is the 
question, who will de Œ will 
win the war, and 
Smeto na
 was convinced that Germans 
are going to lose, and he 
didn't  Œ we didn™t know about that tim
e, but we knew, you know, later, that 
Smetona
 
was against that, and that™s why 
Lithuania
 didn™t Œ didn™t attack 
Poland
 at that 
time, becau se of
 Smetona
 and of thinking, wh ich ou
r director told to us 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Would you say, you know, 
would you say your family 
belonged to a particular 
kind of political wing in 
Lithuania
, or was it fairly typical of, let™s say the mood in 
society? From what I understand there 
was a Christian democrat, an d a more 
nationalist, or national political forces. 
A: Right.

later he drifted closer to this national

Smetona,
 of the president, but he was also critical of 
Smetona
 quite a 
b Œ a bit, but Œ but he was like in betwee
n those two. Now, from my mother™s side, 
everybody was 
Smetona™s. 
Q: So they were mu
ch mo re of a Œ of Œ from the national Œ 
A: Yes, from Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ starting from my  grandfather, through  all those brothers, you know, everybody, 

including my  mo ther was from the national group of 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Would you have cal
led them nationalists? 
A: Translating would be, yes, 
but they were not any kind 
of Nazis, they were anti Œ 
anti Nazi, anti-German. And there were, 
you know, some Œ s-some who Œ wh -who 

were pro-German, and pro-Nazi
,
 like 
Wald emarta s
(ph) and so, but i-it Œ it Œ 
Smetona 
was hostile to that Œ 
Q: Yes.

A: Œ that type of thinking,
 and Œ and those who fo llowed 
Smeto na
 was hostile 
against the Nazi thinking, not only as Œ as
 German, but generally ag ainst Nazi and 
fascist things. Fascism of Italian type 
had more symp athies. There were not too 
many, but Italians type was closer. There was no racism in Œ in 
Italy
, in Œ at least at 
the beginning, na Œ and Œ so, 
but in  Œ in Œ in our circle
s, no, you know, there was no 
Œ no symp athy fo r the Nazis. 
Q: And yet Œ and yet, there was temp tation Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ that Œ that this Œ this
, let™s say encouragement, on be
half of the Nazis to then 
take 
Vilnius
 Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ was tempting. It wasn™t Œ it wasn™t 
something that was dismissed as we j u st 
don™t do that, unless fa Œ is Œ until 
Smetona 
said so. 
A: Right. 
Sm etona, 
well, is not Œ he is not the onl
y one. Also, as I said, our Œ 
director of our school also was of that 
opinion, and Œ and there was other people, 
older people who said, you know, 
don™t do that. Now, even if 
Lithuania
 would have 
attacked 
Vilnius
, that doesn ™t me an that it would be pro-Nazi
 
because he is all Œ th-
the 
Soviet Unio n 
supported 
Lithuania
 in the Polish-Lithuanian Œ 
Q: Conflict.

A: Œ conflict, and here also, you know, Lithuanian Œ 
Germany
 would have became 
Œ become allies for that moment, but lith 
Œ from Lithuanian vi
ewpoint it would be 
just like alliance between Finns and German
s, you know. Not Œ th
ey Œ Finns didn™t 
became Nazis at all, th ey were allies
 during the second World War with the 
Germans, but they still were a democratic 
co untry, and had nothing
 to do with the 
Nazi ideology at all. So that was the idea
. Of course, it was unrealistic. If Œ if would 
have happen ed, of course, Nazis would ha
ve taken everything th at Œ but the hope 
was that, you know, well, so we are allies, ju
st like we were allies with the Soviets, 
now we™re allies with the Germans. But
 S-Smetona
 was against that, 
Smetona 
was 
a very strong leader, maybe a d Œ we c
ould call it dictator, and without him, you 

know, nothing Œ nothing happen s. 
Q: Okay. So Œ so the 
Molo tov-Ribbentro p
 pact is Œ is Œwhat y
ou hear of is between 
non-aggression betw een the 
Soviet Union
 and Nazi 
Germany
. 
A: Right. 
Q: That™s what becomes 
[indecipherable]
 
A: That™s what we knew, and there was 
[indecipherable]
 so nobody kne-knew 
about them. 

Q: Okay. So what happens la
ter, in the early fall, as things progress, and Œ wha Œ 
how does life in 
Panev
¡
žy s 
change? Or does it? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
73
A: Yes, of it Œ it does. First of all, the 
war, you know, the Œ some of the things, the 
commerce became affect
ed. There were some Lithuani
an ships which were ru-run on 
the mines, and we Œ one of the sailors, a 
brother of our classmate came back, I mean 
his ship was sunk in  the
 Baltic 
Sea because ran on the mine. It™s Œ 
Q: It hit a mine. It hit a mine. 

A: Well, hit a mine, well, there were non-contact mines also, you know at that time. 

Q: Okay . 
A: But that™s a technical thi
ng, so anyway, I mean
 th-the ship was blown out of the Œ 
Q: Of the water. 
A: Œ of the water, right. So, you know. And th
en of course Œ and 
of course the ca Œ 
the concern whether
 Lithuania
 could become Œ still be ne 
Œ neutral when such a gr-
great war is starting around. A
nd when  the Soviets attacked 
Poland
 also, from the 
east, then everybody became 
concerned what™s Œ what™s 
now. Because the Soviets 
are taking over all the eastern portion of 
Poland
 Œ well, really the Ukrainians, 
Byelorussians and Lithuanians living th ere,
 but doesn™t matter, you know, it™s Œ was 
still 
Poland
. They took 
Vilnius
, th e Soviets, and now, y
ou know, everybody became 
Œ now we are involved. Soviets recognize
 Vilnius
 as 
Lithuania™s
 capital, now they 
Œ are they going to turn it over to us, or 
will they find, you know, some kind of thing 

to Œ to get out of it, of 
the Œ the commitment. And there was mobilization. There was 
declared, you know, the Lithua
nian army was mobilized to 
protect its neutrality, not

for war. But the Polish army , you k
now, went over the boundary to 
Lithuania
 and 
was disarmed, so they had Œ 
Lithuania 
army had to be there to disarm the Polish 
army coming over, and to inte
rn them as the neutral coun
try™s supposed to do in such 
case. And a lot of Polish military came ove
r, and refugees Œ gene
rally refugees, not 
military refugees from 
Poland
 came to
 Lithuania
, and they found quite Œ quite a bit 
of understanding and symp athy then, you know. 
Poland
 was defeated and broken 
and then , you know, it seemed like, you kn
ow Œ not Œ not an enemy any mo re you 
had to fight, you know. So the Œ there was 
symp athy for them and Œ and Œ and all the 
routine mobilization, we thought wi Œ the Li
thuanian army being 
mobilized that they 
will go to 
Vilnius
. And we Œ we were all, in  our 
class I think everybody was, you 
know, why our army  is not going th ere? But 
as I said, the director explained to us, 
we didn't believe him, but that™s wh at 
it was, the older gene
ration decided it would 
be foolish to get into  that war. And Œ but 
then  we were very mu ch  tol Œ concerned, 

what will be next, you know, everybody wa
s concerned. There wa
s organization, so-
called 
Sauliai
(ph). 
Q: What is it? How would you translate it? 

A: It is close to national guard, p-partly
 like a reserves, part like national guard. 
There was a military people a-after they serv
ed in the army, they 
were released into 
reserves, an d they voluntar
ily joined that organiza
tion, which was a military 
organization, but not quite. It differs, fo r instance, from the na
tional guard in that

was Œ that he Œ they had also cultural thing.
 They  had dances, they had lectures also, 
you know. 
Q: So it was somewhat civic? 
A: Somewhat civic, yeah. But it was very po
pular, a lot of people in the Œ men, and 
also women belonged to that organization. 
And it™s also part Œ was part of the Œ of 
the country™s military 
capa Œ ca Œ capacity, and so  Œ a
nd we were a-also our Œ the 
students of Œ in the high school, in the hi
gher classes, now also belonged to that 
organization. I belonged too,
 voluntarily, whoever wanted, there was no pressure at 
all to join, but I joined it. And 
we were also called to duty then. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Then the mobilization came and we were 
sent to Œ on the guard duty in Œ in  the 
city as a Œ I™m writing in my memoirs, th
ere will be no Œ our students were not quite 
military minded at all,
 you know, they might have m-ma
de Œ made a Œ a Œ a play out 
of it, and it was a serio u s thing, so we 
Œ we were removed from the guard  duty and 
sent to a place where there were no people. 
Q: Well, what do you mean by made 
a play out of it, they Œ they  Œ 
A: Well, they were starting, the girls we
re going to  Œ to th e school o-on Œ thro ugh 
the bridge Œ the brid ge, they were supposed
 to guard the bridge. 
They started on, you 
know, ch-checking their bags and all that ki
nd of thing, and it was a flirt really . And 
it was Œ and wh en Œ wh en th
e lead ers found out, they  we
re terrified. They said, I

76
mean, the p Œ the parents will 
complain, so we will go befo
re court martial for this 
thing, you know. So th ey took off of Œ of
 duty us comp letely and sent to guard 
gasoline tanks and Œ and outs
ide place. They want Œ 
Q: Where th ere were no girls whose bags you could ch eck. 
A: No girls, no. And no people at all, ju st a gr-great, friendly dog who came to visit 

us, that™s all.  

Q: Okay. So that is how, 
in the early fall, things seemed to be developing. 
A: Right. 

Q: What happens next? 

A: Well, mobilization was called off, we came 
back to our classes. Our cl Œ school 
was taking over for Œ for military
 ca Œ no, th e girls™ school was taking over for the Œ 
the military . The girls went to our school 
in th e daytime, we went during the 
nighttime to our school, because it was di
fferent schools, gi
rl and Œ and boys™ 
school. And Œ but it was a short period of tim
e, and of course there was news that, 
you know, 
Lithuania
 is recovering
 Vilnius
, Soviets are letting have 
Vilnius
 for
 
Lithuania
. Not all the territory which 
Lithua nia
 claimed and the Soviets recognized 
before, you know, they Œ they
 just returned a quarter of
 the territory, but with the 
capital city. And also was news that, you kn
ow, the military bases, Soviet military 
bases will be introduced in
 Lithuania .
 The Soviets will have military bases in 
Lithuania. 
So, everybody was really happy th at 
Vilnius
 is returning to 
Lithuania
,

and everybody was concerned that the So
viet army  is being in troduced in 
Lithua nia  
and having bases here. It 
was not a big surp rise really, because before that
 Estonia
 
and
 L a tv ia
 already were forced. They
 didn™t get anything, bu
t they had to take in 
Soviet bases, Soviet guard

 at the time? 
A: Yes, yes, that was in the news

Gureckas, 
you were at the point wh ere you were 
explaining the introduction of
 Soviet military bases in 
Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia
 
had them. I wanted to  go back fo r a minut
e to the first declaration of war, when 
Poland 
was attacked by Nazi 
Germ any
 and then is also attacked by the 
Soviet 
Unio n. 

A: Right. 
Q: Do you know Œ was there a sense, did 
you Œ was there any discussion or did you 
have a feeling ab out Œ I™m doing all of this
 as a preface, what 
the Jewish community 
was thinking, how people in 
the Jewish community were r
eacting to these events, the 
local Jewish community in 
Panev

 Was there any Œ any 
knowledge Œ I mean, I

78
don™t have a sense that you know, was mu ch
 contact, but did you Œ do you reme mb er 
anything about that? 
A: Well, personally I didn't have, at that tim
e, connections. We had Jewish friends in 
our Œ in our class, but Œ a
nd one was fairly close to me, but we somehow didn™t 
discuss mu ch about this situation. But it was from my  parents™ contacts, we knew 

that, of course the Jew s were concerned 
about the German attack, and the German 
strength, wh ich they  showed, you know, 
and the power. And of co urse everybody 
knew how hostile the Nazis are against Œ agai
nst the Jews. So, th
e concern was quite 
stunder Œ understandab le. But that™s Œ that
™s about Œ about it. 
I mean, there were 
concern, but Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ I don™t know. Of course they
 Œ they were not in favor that 
Lithuania
 would 
attack 
Poland
, you know, but 
[indecipherable]
 they didn™t. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So Œ so it seemed Œ so I Œ I don™t know. I could transfer my  
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Okay . 
A: I had no Œ 
Q: Okay . So, when we™re talking about th
ose military bases, you 
Œ you get the news 
in school. Do you rememb er 
how you got the news that 
Vilnius
 is going to  come 
back into  Lithuanian  contro l, 
do you rememb er where you were? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
79
A: Oh, ev erybody was at Œ at the radios at that time. 
Q: Okay . 

A: We 
[indecipherable]
 the Lithuanian delegation, 
government delegation was in 
Moscow. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So we knew that it will be decided one
 way or the other, a
nd so everybody was 
just glued to  the radio and listening wh
en th e end Œ wh en it was announced, you 
know, the news, and eventually it was, yo
u know, that this Œ the treaty between 
Lithuania
 and 
Soviet Unio n
 is signed and 
Vilnius
 is really Œ really turned to 
Lithuania
, and the military garrisons
 will be introduced in
 Lithuania
, Soviet 
military. 

Q: What date was this, do you rememb er? 

A: It was, yeah, it was 1939, October 10
th
 was they signed the treaty and we knew 
about that October 11
th
, in the morning, from the radio. 
Q: From the radio. 

A: Yeah, and th en, of course, newspape
rs. And the newspapers were a great 
disappointment because they 
showed new boundary between 
Lithuania
 and th e 
Soviet Unio n
, and as I said, I mean, just a quarte
r of the territory was being returned 
to 
Lithuania
, three-quarters was just kept, 
Stalin
 for themself. A
nd the problem is 
that the Lithuanian areas were the fa
rmers, and generally the population was

80
Lithuanian in that area. Th
ey  fell to the Œ to  th Œ to th e Soviet side, you know. 
Lithuania
 didn™t receive even th
ose territories which were
 ethnically Lithuanian. 
Q: Are these Œ was this part of 
Belarus, 
where these Œ 
A: It became part of 
Belarus 
then. 
Q: Œ 
[indecipherable] Belarus
, mm-h m.  
A: Par Œ became part of 
Belarus
. Later the boundary 
was adjusted when
 Lithuania
 
was occupied, but the areas like 
Druskininka i,
 like

ionys
, they were part of 
Belarus Œ Belarus
 at that time. 
Q: So you got bad Œ good 
news, bad news basically Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ Octo ber 11
th
. 
A: That™s right, that™s right. So the Œ the 
enthusiasm was Œ was k-kind of mu ted at 
that point, and there was a meetin g, you 
know, and i-it was muted, until really the 
Soviets Œ Soviets kept 
Vilnius
 for a couple of weeks ye
t, and they were r-really 
plundering the ke Œ the city during that tim
e, and eventually th
e Lithuanian army 
took over
 Vilnius
. And s-somehow you know, at that
 point, wh en Lithuanian army  
marched into 
Vilnius
, the country became split pers
onality, the people said now we 
are going to celebrate, we are going to wo
rry tomorrow. Every
body knew that there 
is a lot of to Œ something to  wo rry, but to
day we are celebrating, tomo rrow we are Œ

are g Œ are going to  wo rry. And that™s what
 we did, we celebrated and then  we 
started to Œ to worry right away 
after that, after the celebration. 
Q: And Œ okay, so now 
Lithuania™s 
in 
Vilnius
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you Œ wh en was the first 
time you saw a Soviet soldier? 
A: Oh, that was an accident, the Œ well, again, after 
Lithuania
 Œ the Soviets had 
called the govern ment delegation from
 Finland
 in Œ into 
Moscow
 and started 
discussions with the Finns, and they hadalso, you know, demands, which the Finns 

re Œ refused. So, in Œ in a m
onth™s time the Soviets attacked 
Finland
 and became 
Finnish Winter War. And now 
everybody was 
for Finns in 
Lithua nia
. 
Soviet Union
 
was supposed to be our ally, and well, ally, but we Œ we Œ we still were for the Finns, 

they were so Œ so heroically
 defending their country, you 
just couldn™t help it. Now, 
one of the Soviet planes was bombing
 Helsinki, 
ar Œ or some other Finnish  cities, 
anyway, was one bomb  Œ on th e bomb ing ra
id. The Finns were shooting back , and 
the p Œ th e pa Œ the plane was damaged, co
uldn™t navigate very well, but turn ed 

south, went over
 Estonia, Latvia
, came to 
Lithuania
 and near 
Panev
¡
žy s,
 crashed. 
Well, really, crash landed, I would say. 
Q: Crash landed, okay. 
A: Crash landed. The pilots came 
out and said, I mean, how far is
 Riga
? Well, they 
flew over
 Riga
 already, but they couldn™t tell a
ny more. So, the Soviets from their

82
barra Œ from their military bases in 
Lithuania
 came, the Soviet soldiers to that place, 
dismantled the plane and brought it to the ra
ilroad station and took it. And we saw 
then that plane, it went through our gymna
sium, through the street in front of us. 
Everybody was at the Œ at the window, and 
we saw the plane, a
ll warped by bullets, 
which wa Œ wa Œ that Œ and we saw Soviet soldiers taking that plane away. So  that 
was the first time we saw the Soviet sold
iers, taking aw ay  that damaged plane. 
Q: So y Œ so  you Œ the Œ so, in othe
r words, the garrison had already been 
established, but you just hadn™t seen them yet. 
A: No Œ yeah, th-they were Œ th
ey were close, they were Œ 

Q: They were close. 
A: Œ they were Œ they were 
not Œ not Œ not going to be 
Œ to the streets or anything 
like that. There were Œ there were garrisons
 who were there, but they were closed. 
Q: Closed. 
A: They didn™t let their soldiers r
oom around Œ ro am 
around at all. 
Q: Okay . And th at plane is what you see, a
nd it™s in Œ and it™s in bits and pieces, and 
it goes by your school window, and it™s 
of great curiosity to everybody. 

A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
83
A: Yeah. Also a bittersweet
 thing, because you know, 
w-we like to see the Œ the 
plane warped by the Finnish bullets, but
 then the so Œ So
viet soldiers in 
Lithuania
 
was, you know, a bitter part of it.  
Q: Yeah. Ho w many Œ how many mo re minutes do we have? 
Q2: Well, we™ve only got two. 

Q: Then let™s finish right here. 

A: Okay . 
Q: Let™s finish right here and we
™ll continue mo re after lunch. 
Q2: As we were talki
ng about the Finnish. 
Q: As we were talking about
 the Finnish yes. All right.

Beginning Tape Three 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with
 Algima ntas Gureckas
 on October 14
th
, 2010. Mr. 
Gureckas
, where 
we left off, you were descri
bing to us how you saw the 
downed Soviet plane which 
had fo ught Œ wh ich was flying against Œ in
 the Finnish  Œ th e Winter War against 
Finland,
 how it landed near 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
and you saw the dismantled parts of it being 
taken by Soviet soldiers, and it aroused a 
great deal of curiosity amongst the Œ th e 
kids in school, and you all 
went to the windows to take a look. I wanted to ask a 
question about, let™s say, how kids felt then
 when these events were happening. And 
bring it back to the very beginning of tens
ions. Did you, as Œ as
 young studen ts have 
an urge to do so mething, whether it was agai
nst the Germans, or against the Poles, or 
against the Soviets, to defe
nd your country? Were there any such  student types of 

discussions or ideas going on, or 
even actions that were taken? 
A: Well, I could tell about one really ridicu
lous thing, because we were 15 years old 
when the Œ there was a tension about 
Klaip
¡
da
, a problem, the Germans were 
pressing 
Lithuania
 at that time, and it was clear th
at they will, sooner or later will 
demand that
 Lithuania
 return 
Klaip
¡
da
, together with the 
Klaip
¡
da
 territory to 
Germany
. So my classmate, and my close friend,
 he told me that he heard a rumor 
that there is no organization, but secretly 
Lithuanian army is 
mobilizing, taking the 
volunteers, registering the volunteers, and he
 Œ he kind of suggested that we mi ght

be interested in that. So I Œ I sa
id yes. My father was fighting for 
Lithuania
, now it™s 
my  turn, y-you know. And we we
nt togeth er with him to Œ 
Q: Did you tell your father? 
A: No, of course not. That would be the en
d of the story. No, we went togeth er with 
him to the military office in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, and just asks whether, you know, th ey Œ 
they need  any voluntaries to fight for 
Lithuania
. Well, the sergeant there was kind 
of a Œ excited. I mean, he was Œ he wa
s dumbfounded really, you know. And we 

couldn™t understand why Œ why he was you 
know, so kind of confused. We just 
wanted to fight for 
Lith uania
, that™s all, that seems so 
Œ and he, an elderly sergeant, 
you know, was a pr Œ now 
I can see, you know, why Œ 
why he was Œ the children 
want fight for
 Lithuania
, well Œ but that was the end of
 the story. They said no, 
thank you, you know. If we need we w
ill call on you, and 
we™ll call nev Œ 
everybody. But now Œ now, we
 don™t need your service.
 But good Œ good boys, you 
know, grow up. You will be good
 soldiers someday. Okay, so
 we went back to class, 
and somehow, apparently my fri
end to ld ma Œ our Œ our friend 
Rubinsteina s
(ph), a 
Jewish friend. He was one of our gang, 
Shalamas
(ph) 
Rubinsteinas
(ph), and he Œ 
apparently  my  friend told him about that st
ory, and he was all 
upset that we didn™t 
take him with th Œ with Œ with us. 
He also wanted to fight Germans. 
Q: Wanted to fight.

lly disagreement we had with him i-in our 
Œ in our friendship. So Œ so that™s Œ that™s 
the story. After that, of course, we were i-
in that organ Œ organization,

, I would call like national guard. And we took 
seriously our duties, you know, wh
enev er we were called upon. 
Q: To check the girls™ bags. 
A: Y-Yeah, well that™s Œ I didn™t do that. 

Q: Okay .

A: No, n-nothing ag ainst the Po
les. I mean, the thing went 
too f Œ too fast. We didn™t 
Œ we didn™t even realize 
what the ultimatum was ac-acc
epted, you know. And I was 
sick at that time at home, you know, so I Œ 
I don™t know how my  friends reacted, and 
Œ at school. But no, this thing beca
me only wh en the Soviets occupied 
Lithuania
, 
then Œ then we found 
tha-that we have to resist th
at somehow. And that™s another 
part of my  story, you know, wh
en  a Œ wh en the Soviets annex 
Lithuania
, occupied  
and annexed 
Lithuania
. Yeah, I was looking for a pl
ace, you know, I could join 
some resistance group. And the only group 
I knew was the Catholic organization, 
adate Œ 
Q: What was it called? 
A: 
Adaytis

Q: I see. 
A: 
Adaytis

, 
Smetona™s

Smetona™s

A: Right. 
Q: So let™s go back to October, when th
e bases appear, yo-you hear the news, the 
Molo tov-Ribbentro p
 pact, the bases appear, the pl
ane is down, you see the Œ the 
parts going on. How did life change after 
that? How di Œ did 
it Œ did you feel it 
impact you in any way when  
those bases first arrived? 
A: No, the things quieted 
down. While the Soviets were
 fighting against the Finns, 
they didn™t put any pressure on 
Lithuania
. The bases were there, you know, but 
there were no conflicts as far as w e were
 conc Œ you know, aware. And it seemed 
like, you know, we were a gr Œ very upset and appreh en sive i-in the fall, about 

October, November. But in the springtime of 1940, it looked like 
the things quieted 
down . 

Q: Life hadn™t changed much. 

A: The life, they didn™t change mu ch. Of
 course, war was going on, as I said, you 

know, and there were Œ there were less selec
tion in  the Œ in the Œ in th e Œ in th e m Œ

ou know. But life was going pretty normal 
by that time. 

Q: So th  Œ th e government Œ what had happened to Mr.
 Smetona
, President 
Smetona
? Did he stay around? Was he still president? 
A: Yes, he was still president. Government
 was fank Œ functioning 
as it always did. 
It seemed like the things quieted down
. Of course, we were following war. The

following what™s going on, because it was Œ  
Q: Was this through Lithuanian radio, 
or Œ or newspapers, 
or was this also 

internation Œ did you get any ki
nd of international broadcasts? 
A: At that time Lithuanian b Œ was suffici
ent. We got from Lithuanian newspapers, 
Lithuanian radio the information. Of c
ourse, other s Œ radio stations, German, 
Russian and others were availa

that at that time.

A: Well, the occupation. Because Œ 

Q: What does the occupation 
mean in this ken Œ in this
 sense? You have bases, but 
how does that change to occupation? 

A: Oh yeah, the bases were 
limited in certain places, a

didn™t let their soldiers roam
 around, you know, they were 
all in Œ in the bases. And

end go. So I said, oh, my Œ my father has 
something to  Œ

A: Œ for me to do. Well, it was a y o unger
 boy from the high school, and Œ but two 

classes lower, because he was younger. He wa

, and then my father came 
and said let Œ let him go, and then I said, 
my father has somethi

And then  my  father said, you know, the Soviets are occupying 
Lithuania
. And that 
was in the afternoon. Night, we slept dur
ing the night. During th e night the Soviet 
troops came from

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I didn™t see that Œ that massive movement, it was during th e night, and somehow I 

didn™t hear it, and Œ although th ere should 
have been some Œ some noi Œ a lot of 
noise, but somehow I slept well. And that™s it. And wi Œ 

Q: Was your house in the middle of town , was it on the outsk irts?

Q: No, I™m talking your place, where you lived , where you Œ 
A: Oh, in the Œ in the mi
ddle of the town, really. 
Q: Okay . 
A: We had our house quite near the cente
r, right near my high school. And Œ well, 
it™s difficult to say, but you know, there were
 also reports in the radio, in the press 
that the president has left 
Lithuania
, he fled 
Lithuania
, so he was condemned that 
he didn™t stay with his coun
try during the critical time, an d 
all that kind of thing, and 
this Œ 

Q: Was this Œ was this still the Lithua

A: Still the Lithuanian press, it seemed lik
e Lithuanian press, but apparently the

A: Yeah, so Œ and Œ and th en, you know, 
that same day, it was Sunday. Saturday 
there was the ultimatum 
and they marched into
 Lithuania
 and in
 Panev
¡
žy s
 Sunday  
afternoon, I saw the first communist demonstration in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 in the main square. 
The people didn™t Œ didn™t 
walk the streets. It was Su
nday and the city was kind of 
empty. I went to s Œ into this Œ the city 
to take a look at wh at
™s going on. Noth ing. 
Were Œ were very few people 
going dur Œ during th e streets, 
in the streets. Not like a 
regular Sunday. And then I went to the ma
in square and there was a demonstration, 
not a big one, maybe 
50 - 60 people there. 
Q: Young, old? 
A: Mostly young, I would 
say, mostly young people. An
d they were Œ had the red 
flag there, and they were speaking in 
Lithuanian, you know, against the sovi Œ 
Smetona 
govern ment, against the Œ the w
hole system, a g ainst the fascist  
government, as they called here Œ 
Smetona™s
 government. And the others were 
listening to that, and j-just seemed like a
ll of them Œ of the people were Jewish. 
Q: How did Œ how did you 
know? I mean, how did it seem Œ why would Œ why 
would you make that assu
mp tion? How did you Œ ye
ah , how could you tell? 
A: Well, typically from Œ from the racial features, and from the accent the speakers 
used. The listeners, of course, I don™t know
. Well, I didn't check all, I was kind of 
aside, you know, I wasn™t in the demonstr ation itself. So it™s difficult to say, you 
know, the composition, but it Œ the impression 
was like most of them or even all of

them were Jewish. Now, my fa Œ the 
Jew Œ the communist party was illegal in
 
Lithuania
 before that. Even
 when the Œ when the bases 
came in, it still was illegal. 
My father was work ing 
in the court system, and so me of
 the Œ of the clients, as he 
called, he had some communists also, who were accused just of the communist 
activities. And so he was conc
erned that now, you know, 
that things changed, and 
those communists will became 
very influential. And Œ 
Q: What did he say Œ what 
did he tend to say about those communists that were his 
clients, earlier? Did he 
have opinions about them? 
A: Yeah, he had a negative opinion, b
ecause one of the Œ of the important 
communists which he was exim Œ examini
ng his activities, was from a very rich 
Jewish family in 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember th eir name? 
A: From very rich Œ pardon? 

Q: Do you remember their name? 
A: No, I wouldn't, but I Œ I could find, beca
use he was important later on, so maybe I 
could find out later, but I don™t rememb er 
exact now. And so i-i Œ even  that, you 
know, for him looked kind of ridiculous or
 Œ or Œ or unaccepta
ble that from such a 
rich family, you know, he becomes co
mmunist, and is work ing against the 
Lithuanian government, really. A nd I must 
say, later he was concerned that he will

become imp Œ im Œ important person, wh
ich was right, he became very important 
person. But became not in
 Panev
¡
žy s,
 but in 
Vilnius
.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I ent Œ the Œ the story is interesting.
 He was afraid that
 there will be some 
revenge. There was nothing 
from that. He didn™t Œ 
Q: Who was Œ who was afraid there would be revenge? 
A: My father. 
Q: I see. 
A: My father was afraid that they Œ he w
ill re Œ take revenge against him because he 
was conducting that investig
ation. But there was none. 
Q: Okay . 

A: He was Œ he was in 
Vilnius
, he was doing his Œ co mmunists were there, you 
know, and whatever, and th ere was none. 
But there were some other people, you 
know, who take revenge
, mostly criminals. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Who also thought, I mean, they might be
 Œ so, th-they had th
e problem there, but 
this communist wasn™t Œ he just ignored . 
Q: So when you s Œ okay, when  you sa
w this demonstrati
on, wh at Œ do you 
remember what your feeli
ngs were at the time?

Q: I was afraid. I was afraid that the revol
ution is going on, from wh at I heard what 
happened  in  
Russia
, you know, with all the crueltie
s of the revolution might happen 
right Œ right here, right 
now, you know, in Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s
. They  decided Œ th ey 
decided th at they sh Œ you 
know, they should go and disp
erse the police, this Œ the 
fash Œ fascist police, as they said. And th
ey Œ they march with 
their red flag, they 
march toward police, I didn™t
 follow them, and I f Œ later find out that the Lithuanian
 
military officer in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 telephoned the Soviet
 forces, whichever the 
co mman d er was in  
Panev
¡
žy s, 
and asks whether, you know
, that™s supposed what™s 
Œ what should happen
, because they were trying to 
Œ to disperse the police, you 
know, and take the po
lice headquarters in 
Panev
¡
žy s
. And the Soviet commander 
said no, no demonstrations, 
nothing is allowed, and if
 you don™t Œ if you don™t 
protect the quiet in Œ in the city, we will have
 to take care of it and provide this Œ this 
Œ so th-there would be no d 
Œ no demonstrations, nothing
. So then, you know, h-he 
co Œ the c Œ the commandant, th
e Lithuanian officer called 
−auliai
, and we were also 
called, I Œ oh, we went to the
 −a ulia i
 headquarters, we have given rifles, and we 
were supposed Œ there was Œ commandant™s 
hour, was supposed to
 enforce that, to 
patrol the streets, and see that nobod
y walks during the ni
ghttime, which we Œ 
Q: And you did that? 
A: Which we did, yeah. I did, and my  fri
ends did. That was quite Œ nobody was 
demonstrating nothing, n
obody was walking around.

did you recognize anybody? W
ithin that demonstration was 
there anybody you personally
 knew or recognized? 
A: No, no, no. 
Q: No. 
A: Not at all.  

Q: And did you know of Lithuanian co
mmunists? Not Je wish communists, but 

Lithuanian communists, who e
ither would be there, or w
ho had been  in somehow or 
other known , or active? 

A: No, not Œ not real communists. There 
were people, very leftists, you know, 
opinions, one Œ one Œ one Œ one doctor, he 
was a friend of the family. He was Œ he 
was very leftist, but he wasn™t Œ he was very favorable about the 
Sov i et Unio n
. H e  Œ  
he had very favorable opinion, but he wasn
™t communist, he wasn™t working for the 
party or anything like that, so. 

Q: Did anything Œ do you know wh at happen
ed to him when this 
Œ there was the fo Œ 
the Soviet occupation? Did his 
[indeciphera ble]
 change? 
A: He became director of the Œ of the hospital. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And then  I think he expanded that hospita
l very well. He Œ he
 would Œ as Œ as a 
docto r he was really, you know
, valued under the system. 
But I Œ I su Œ susp ect mo-
more than a doctor than Œ th
an a co Œ I don™t think hewas really a communist, even

after Œ in particular after he saw, you kn
ow, the communism in 
Œ you know, in Œ in 
real life. 
Q: I want to go back  again to th at demons
tration. You said you were scared. Did you 
have any view of Œ did you 
have any Œ any thoughts ab
out the demonstrators? You 
know, why they were demonstrating? Were
 you surprised to see it? Were you Œ 
A: I was surprised, but I understood th at 
there Œ there are communists, so we Œ we 
knew my father said that there 
[in d ecipherable]
 are the young, some young Jewish 
people, the communists wi Œ is popular be
tw een some young Jewish peop Œ men and 

Œ and la Œ and girls. So it wasn™t really mu
ch of surprise. Still, it was a very small, I 

mean, there were thousands of Jews in Œ in
 Panev
¡
žy s.
 This Œ this group was small 
group, and apparently  that™s Œ 
that™s the limit at that time. 
Q: Okay , so you dispersed, and it went away , and it Œ it wasn™t something th at 

stayed. 

A: Yeah, I don™t know exactly, I didn™t follo
w them, and I went home, and then I got 
the call, that
 −aulia i
 are called for duty. But what ha
ppened in between
, except that 
thing the Œ our military, Lithua
nian military officer telephon
ing the Soviets, that Œ I 
was told about that, but I don™t know ex actly how it went, yeah. 
Q: Okay, so now it™s occupied, there is
 no mo re Lithuanian government, the 
president has left. What else 
happened, what else changed? 
A: Well, demonstrations.

99
Q: More of them? 
A: Oh yeah, well Œ but those were official
s, you know. The peopl
e had to go into 
demonstrations. From their work ing places 
they were told that they better go, you 
know, and there was a threat, unconcealed threat
 that si Œ  they will take care of all 
those who are against the people™s 
government, as they say. And Œ 
Q: How did you Œ I mean, from your story I get a sense that there was this Œ that 
there was a benign feeling for most 
of the independen
ce years about the 
Soviet 
Unio n. 
A: Right. 
Q: That when there was the 
Finno-Russian 
war, then you were on the side of the 
Finns because you know, they 
were the weaker, or the Œ 
it was their territory that 
was being attacked, and so it was mo re that
 you were on their side than the Soviet 

side. But wh en did it stop being a beni
gn feeling? Wh en  did it start being a 
threatening feeling? One where you™re
 Œ where you™re saying, these are our 
enemies? When  did that Œ wh en did that change 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Beginning was the firs
t Œ the intr Œ i-introduction of 
the military bases, that Œ that 
was the first, and then the thing, you get 
Œ you get deep er. But that Œ that was the 
first.  

Q: Okay, so that™s October, 1939.  

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

100
Q: And then  in June 1940
 there™s a full occupation. 
A: Right. But even then, before that, go Œwith the World War goin
g on, in particular 
w-with 
France 
collapsing, many people were thinking th at 
Lithuania
 might not be 
able to survive as indepe
ndent country . And there was 
a discussion going on, which 
is better, th at the Germans would take ov
er or the Œ or the Russians? Because 
Po-
Poland
 wa-was gone, you know, 
was conquered by the Œ by both  of them and 
partitioned. And I would say Œ I was inclined that it ba Œ may be better under the 
Germans, my  opinion. Not very
 strong, but I was leaning th
at way. But th Œ I would 
say the majority of Lithuanians we knew in  
Œ in the circle, were of the opinion that 
maybe the Russians occupation would be mo
re benign, because the Russians are not 
that efficient, not th at organized in our opinion.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And Œ and Lithuanian na
tion would have a better chance to survive longer Œ long 
time than under harsh and efficient German oc
cupation. So even  at that point, people 
were leaning more toward th
e Russians than the Germans, 
more toward the Soviets. 
Well, the Russians they were call Œ calling 
at that time, u n til the occupation itself. 
Q: And why were you, you kno
w, slightly more inclined 
toward Œ if Œ of Œ of the 
two evils, the German one
 would be the lesser? 
A: That™s difficult to say f-for me, 
I don™t know. Maybe from the times of 
Taurag
¡
, 
their culture were more familiar to me. 
And you know, we ha
d very  good German

teacher, even a g Œ a Germ
an, Lithuanian German in
 Panev
¡
žy s
, and German 
culture, ma ybe made impression on me. I Œ I Œ I like Œ I read Œ I Œ I knew German 
language fairly well. I star
ted reading German books. Th
 Œ just that. It wasn™t 
something very Œ very firm, you know, bu
t I would say I was leaning that way. 

Q: Okay . So it Œ 

A: And the communist system somehow looked 
inefficient, distasteful. Thi Œ thi Œ I 
Œ I didn™t realize the amount of Œ of vi
olence in the nationa Œ national soc Œ 
socialistic German 
[indecipherable]
 I didn™t re-realize that 
much, than what I f Œ 
later found out. And the Soviets were pretty
 obvious. Once they came in, they were 
obvious. They wer Œ they we Œ they we
re threatening. They were not Œ not Œ 
propaganda was befo
re they came in. 
Q: The pro Œ there was, or there was not propaganda? 

A: There was a lot of propaganda but they
 didn™t care wh ether we believed or not Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ because the main thing was the threat behind it. 
Q: Okay, okay. So when th
ey actually occupied Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ then  that changed? Then they  cared that you believed it? 
A: Oh, they cared all th e time, but I Œ I 
don™t know, you know, e-even being friendly 
to them didn™t mean much, yo
u know? So me ca Œ somehow Œ

Q: Show me Œ explain to me how this thre
at made itself felt. Even Œ you know, you 
have a Œ up to th Œ I have a picture of Sovi
ets in the street s, Ru
ssian soldiers in the 
streets, this demonstration, an ideology that™s against the Œ the former independent 
government and so on. But wh at makes th
is scary? What makes this aggressive? 
A: Well, they started arresting people pr
etty soon, you know, I don™t know, ma Œ 
maybe not the first week, but the 
second or third week, some of 
Lithuania™s
 
ministers from the previous govern ment were
 arrested and brou Œ and not arrested in 
Lithuania
, but arrested and brought to th e 
Soviet Un ion. 
And then, just in about a 
month time, you know, the Œ a lot of people 
get arrested, including my director of 
our high school. 

Q: The one who said that 
Germany
 would lo se the war? 
A: Right. Yeah, he was arrested, I Œ a Œ 
a Œ a good man, you know, we knew, and a 
lot of other people wh o were considered, you know, like leading 
in this society, 

having influence in the society. There were
 thousands arrested. And the thing, you 
know, the Œ there was a prison in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 in the center of th
e city, built by the 
tsars, not far from the Œ our 
house. Our house was in the 
neighborhood of
 Œ of that 
prison. And right there, you know, the pris
on was Œ had bars in Œ in the windows. 
Now the bars stayed, but once the Russian
s came in, you know, th
ey put like some 
boxes over the windows, so th-they couldn
™t see. Maybe they could see from the Œ 
one Œ from the top, the Œ the sun, some Œ 
some light, but they couldn™t see anything

103
outside. You know, even tho-those small th
ings, you know, this Œ that Œ the prison 
not good enough, they Œ th
ey had to make it mu ch Œ 
much wo rse, you know, to 
isolate people they couldn™t see outside. Y
eah, and pretty soon ev en the Œ from our Œ 
from our gymnasium, from our
 Œ not from our class, but
 you know, they were 
arrested, even Œ even the students. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Upperclassmen that means, older Œ 
A: Upperclassmen, yeah. 

Q: Upperclassmen. 
A: Upperclassmen. 
Q: Did you know any of them? 

A: Oh yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Can you surmise w h at Œ you know, indivi
duals, why they were 
arrested, why they 
would have been arrested? 

A: Yeah, one of them was active in that 
Daiteninkai
(ph), that Christian Catholic 
organization, before Œ appare
ntly therefore, he was arrested. Well, the resistance 
movement started already, so th at might be 
the things they Œ and they were not very 
par-particular to get exactly their man, you 
know. And if-if they 
wanted to get their 
man, you know, and they didn™t know who 
it is, so they took 
10 of them, thinking 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
104
that most likely one 
of them will be the Œ they are lo
oking for. And that™s it, that™s Œ 
that was Œ pretty soon we found that th
at mattered, you know. The terror started 
pretty soon. Not the first days, but pretty 
soon. And of course, everything chan ged. 
My father lost his job. A lot of people were
 changed in Œ in gove
rning positions, in Œ 
even in technical positions. So  Œ but no-not 
only that, but a lot of people were losing 
their jobs and Œ in the gove
rnment, and in administration. And ev erything th at, you 
know, made very oppressive 
[inaudible] 
Q: Did you hear of any Œ any mu
rders? Did you hear of any Œ 
A: At that time not yet. 
Q: Okay , okay. Did anybody co me home from those prisons, and so Œ 
A: No, no. 
Q: So no Œ people were a
rrested, but they  didn™t come
 back from being arrested? 
A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: Okay . And th at happens 
all in June, July, 1940? 
A: July. 

Q: July. 

A: July. June was just a half a mo nth ba Œ two weeks left. June 15
th
 they took a Œ 
marched into 
Lithuania
, 16
th
, so July. But fr Œ right fro
m very beginning of July. 
Q: So, what was the summer of 1940 like fo r you? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
105
A: Summer was easy because we went to the Œ 
on the vacation. Well, I Œ first o f all, 
after this in cident in Œ in Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, when we had to enfo rce the commandant™s 
hour, it was vacation time, as far as the school is concerned. So I went to my  
mother™s farm, which was where she was co
me from, and her sister was there, you 
know, running the farm with her husband. A
nd so  I went there, and I went there 
because I thought Œ I mean, th
is Œ this territory might be
 taken over by the Germans. 
There were rumors you know, that Œ 

Q: And you preferred to
 still, you know Œ yeah. 
A: Yeah, since I preferred to stay wi
-with the Germans, 
you know, I-I thought 
maybe Œ now I found out th-that not Œ th
ere was a division. The Germans were 
taking Œ supposed to  
take over part of 
Lithuania
 there. But nobody knew exactly, 
you know, where the Œ the dividing line w
ould be. Bu t eventu ally they didn™t. The 
Russians took over the Œ the en
tire country. So, then they
 went back home and we 
went on our regular vaca
tion with our Œ my  uncle 
in the Œ in the eastern 
Lithuania
 
in that Œ 

Q: The one with the nice farm with
 the lakes and things like that? 
A: With the lakes, yeah.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
106
A: And wi-w i Œ and with Œ with  the boat in 
the lake and all that. And it was a really 
quiet place. There was not much going. We heard on the radio, we read in the 

newspapers all the changes going on in  the country . 
Q: And this is by the Œ by th is point S
oviet press, Soviet Lithuanian  press? 
A: Y-Yes, it all Œ officially some of them 
that still had old names, but obviously they 
were run already by different people appo
inted by the new government. So it was a 
quite Œ we were Œ you know, 
we were disturbed what Œ ab
out what it was happening, 
but at that particular place, nothing 
mu ch was happening. And people were all 
concerned, everybody was tense. There was 
supposed  to be elections to the people™s 
parliament, where you know, there were exac
tly that many candidates as had to be 
elected deputies. People boy Œ boycotted th-tha
t, or even if they
 voted, they drew, 
you know, the cartoon characte
rs instead of the bulletins 
inside. Bu t that was about 
it, there Œ there was not much, 
and the meantime they annexed 
Lithuania
. This Œ 
this parliament was called into th
e session and accepted  the request 
[indecipherable]
 
Lithuania
 would be included in the 
Soviet Un ion. 
And we were 
working with my father in th
e forest, and came out of the forest into th
e small town, 
and we saw that there were some red flag
s out, and we asked Œ I mean, wh at™s Œ 
what™s now? I mean, w h at™s new? And ther
e was a Œ a smith working at the edge of 
the town , and we ask him, what Œ wh at™s 
now, I mean, why Œ wh
y the red flags here? 
Said, well, they annexed Œ they  annexed 
Moscow
 to 
Lithuania
. So that was that, 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
107
because they annexed Œ announ
ced the annexation. So that 
was very upsetting, but in 
that village not much was 
happening, until, you know, my
 vacation was over, I came 
back to 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
and 
Panev
¡
žy s
 there were changes, there were cha Œ 
Q: What kind of ch
an ges did you see? 
A: Well, even the Soviet placards ne Œ 
red, you know, flags everywhere, you know, 
[indecipherable]
. Pretty soon my father was fired 
from his job, had to  look fo r Œ for 
s Œ for some other job, finally found in  a 
bank, as a clerk in a bank. Those Œ those 
things, let™s see, when Œ when
 did military took 
over? Part of our Œ yeah, I think at 
that time, y eah, th
ey Œ they were 
[indecipherable]
. We were supposed to have that 
much living space, we had much more in our
 own house, so they took the rest of it, 
and put the s Œ the Soviet 
officers into our house. 
Q: So the German Œ the Œ the refugee from 
Klaip
¡
da 
no longer was there in the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, I don™t know, he Œ he a Œ she Œ 
Q: She was gone. 
A: Œ she moved out somewhere, yeah. And so
 they put Œ they pu
t the Soviet officers 
there, and they Œ they chan
ged. Fo r awhile one family was there, then another, and 
finally there was a Soviet Air Force officer, 
and his wife was a Soviet army  medicine 
docto r.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
108
A: So th  Œ and they  had the small, small gi
rl, and they stayed fo
r quite awhile in our 
Œ in our house. And then an
other part of the house wa
s taken over and one of the 
communist leaders, Lithuanian communist le
aders were put in that part of the Œ 
Q: Did you know who this pe
rson was before he took ove
r that part of the house? 
A: We knew  about him, but 
we didn™t know him personally. 
Q: Okay. And how did that Soviet officer 
and his wife, or any of th em behave? Did 
you Œ did Œ were they Œ 
A: O-Oh  th Œ oh, the officer hims elf, you know, th-the air force officer was a 
Ukrainian. Very reserved, very reserved
, very quiet. His wife was completely 
different, very talkative, very expressive, lik ed
 to discuss things with  Œ with Œ here in 
with me with my poor Ru
ssian, which she corrected all the time. And, was very 
friendly lady, very friendly la
dy yeah. And th-the Œ and the girl, you know, th e small 
girl, they Œ they Œ it was difficult. He was 
in Œ in the d Œ on th
e duty, she was on the 
duty sometimes. So they brought a g Œ a girl from 
Ukraine
, a young girl maybe 15 - 
16 Œ 16 - 17 years old maybe, Ukrainian girl
, to take care of their small do Œ small Œ 
small daughter. And that was strange fo r 
us, because that said, you know, y Œ y-you 
cannot live like this Œ this Œ I mean, you 
can™t live like this, you have Œ you will go 
to 
Siberia
, you have to prepare for that. 
Q: They said this? Who said this? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
109
A: This girl, Ukrainian girl. N-Not the offi
cer™s wife, no, that Œ this girl which was 
brought to take care of their ch Œ their ch
ild, said, well Œ why Œ we Œ we didn™t Œ we 
did Œ we didn™t intend to go to 
Siberia
 or anywhere else, 
you know, why Œ why 
should we? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, it was like 
[indecipherable]
. Then she started talk
ing about Ukrainian f-
famine. Now, my father said, well, that™s 
Œ that™s Œ nobo Œ nobody heard about that, 
you know, and sh-sh-she might
 be a little bit, you know, 
she™s Œ she™s Œ you know, 
living in  fantasies, you know, so we Œ we 
just Œ we just discounted that, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. You ignored wh at she was saying. 
A: Yeah, yeah, it Œ it™s Œ it was obvious nonsense, you know, so who c Œ who Œ 
Q: Okay. And that happened in th
e fall of 1940? Sometime in the Œ 
A: Yes, 1940, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Okay . Ho w did th e very Œ 
did you know anything of 
what was going on in th e 
Jewish community in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, and what kind of disc
ussions, how th ey were 
affected by the Soviet occupation, by this 
incorporation, what 
the sentiments there 
were? Did you have any contact with your 
friend who had wanted
 to go help fight 
the Germans with you? Did 
you Œ di Œ yeah, can you te
ll a little bit about what you 
did or did not know? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
110
A: Not much. First of all, was complete
ly obvious and natural that the Jewish 
community was glad that 
Lith-Lithuania
 was not occu pied by th e Germans, and if it 
had to go down, you 
know, it™s better that the Russi
ans took over. W
ith that, many 
Lithuanians would have agreed. Bu t now, 
you know, the Œ the Œ we Œ we noticed 
pretty soon the hostility 
against independent 
Lithuania
, against the previous, not 
only government, but the country itself. No
w, it™s very difficult to say how prev Œ 
prev Œ prevalent this Œ this attitude was. Th
ere was definitely some, in particular in 
the younger generation there. For us Lithua
nians, was a gr-great surprise. We never 
thought that our relations are bad, we 
never thought that the Jewish people are 
somehow disadvantaged  in
 Lithuania
 or Œ or discriminate
d against. Yet, the 
community was kind of separate, jewi Œ bu t we were Œ we were thinking and wer-
were convinced that that wa
s the c hoice of the Jewish 
community. They wanted to 
have their own schools, they wanted to
 have, of course, their religions and 
synagogues and all that kind of thing, 
and th eir organizations. And we didn't mind, 
but a lot of their life w as separate from 
Lithuanian. There were some Jews which 
were integrated into Lit
huanian society, but there were very few of them.  

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There were some Œ some doctors, s Œ in 
particular in Œ in professions. And now, 
you see, I Œ since the Soviet terror becameobvious quite soon, it is very difficult to 
say. Those who were for the Soviet system
 became very loud. 
And they wanted  to 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
111
make, you know, career, to make a do Œ to Œ 
to advance in this new s Œ new society. 
So they were a Œ loud, they
 were active, they were 
running around. They were 
tearing off the Lithuanian symbols, you 
know, from Œ from the houses or wherever 
they were Œ they were. Those who were ag
ainst them whether Lithuanian or Jewish 
or wh atever, were kind of subdued. Becau
se the terror was there, there was no sense 
starting, you know, frankly, resisting th at, or Œ 
Q: Openly resisting it. 
A: Open ly, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So those who were against that were 
quiet and tried to be
, you know, not Œ not 
obvious, you know, with Œ with Œ 

Q: Not noticeably Œ 

A: Œ their opinions there, so you know. So  
it™s this Œ that™s why it™s very difficult to 
say how mu ch of Jewish commu ni Œ comm
unity were collaborating with the Sov Œ 
Soviet occupation. But it Œ 
it was obvious that they were
, because knew Œ officers 
knew Œ knew pe
ople with responsibility th
ere, a lot of them were Jewish. Not all of 
them, some  of them were Lithuanian communists, but there were not that many 
Lithuanian communists. All Lithuanian
 communists got good and significant 
positions at that time, tasks to do, but 
there weren 't that many of them. And once 
they ran out of them, also the Jewish pe
ople came in and there were Œ there were 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
112
mo re of them, l-lot Œ I Œ I don™t know pe
rcentage-wise Œ in numbers wouldn™t be 
more, but percentage-wise definitely ther
e were more Jewish 
collaborators than 
Lithuanian collaborators with the Soviet g
overnment. There were also Russians. The 
Russians also was a split commun
ity because part of them 
were glad that, you know, 
the Russians were taking over the country. 
Even the tsarist ref
ugees from the tsarist 
gov Œ from the Soviet go
vernment, who fled to 
Lithuania
 said well, it™s Œ th-they 
might destroy us, you know, the Russians, wh
o were against this Œ the Soviets, but 
it™s still nice that the 
Russia
 is expanding ag ain. 
Q: Did you have someone say 
th at to you, or did you Œ 
A: Not a ma Œ to Œ i-i-is Œ as somebody
 told to my father
 that, exactly.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: A Œ a Russian he knew, you know, fri
endly. So Œ and so some of them 

collaborated , but some of them, of course, al so tried to just disappear from the view, 

so not to attract any attention, so that 
they wouldn™t be, you know, repressed like 
[indecipherable]
 or the Œ of the govern ment.  
Q: So in this Œ in this situation, it so
unds like there™s growing fear, growing terror. 
A: Right. 
Q: And also a sense of being betrayed. 
A: Right, right.

113
Q: But by whom? And Œ and it Œ 
as far as you could tell at the time, ou Œ th at feeling 
of betrayal, where was it deepest? Wher
e did it sen Œ seem to be deepest? 
A: Against the Jewish community. 
Q: Against the Jewish community. 
A: Against the Jewish community. 

Q: And Œ 

A: Although we were aware Œ we were awar
e that some of them really are against 
the s Œ 

Q: The Soviet system. 

A: Œ Soviet system. But how many Œ how in
fluential were Œ it was difficult for us to 
say. Now, my classmate, 
Rubeinsteinas
(ph) Œ our high school or gymn asium was 
split in two. And Œ 

Q: By th is time you™re 17 years old. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And he Œ he went to an
other gy-gymnasium, so my  contact didn™t disappear, but 
wa-wasn™t that every day contact that we 
had when  we had the same  Œ were in the 
same class. A-And instead we came wa-wa-wa Œ came th e girls from the girls™ 

school, we were mixed up now,
 before they were separate. And yeah, we got f Œ a j Œ 
a Jewish girl come in, there were many mo
re Œ n-not many, but mo re, but I think Œ

114
but I rememb er one of them, and the Œ it was 
obvious that this Œ this girl had nothing 
to do with the commu
nist syste m or whatever, like th
at. She was very quiet, very 
nice girl, very good student. I really admired it Œ re Œ her. I Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er her name? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What was it? 

A: 
U-Uditta

Go rman ita
(ph). 
Q: 
Uditta

Gorm anita

A: Yeah.

but not far from 
Panev

Ramigala
, and her uncle was in

 also a rich

Uditta
(ph) 
was a wonderful girl, was a wonderful girl, we
 were dancing with her. I don™t know, 
I didn™t fell in love with he
r, but I admired her, definitely. 
Q: You liked  her? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Yeah. Do you know what happen
ed to her? What her fate was? 
A: I don™t know, but I s Œ I suppose just 
like other Jews were all Œ were rounded up 
and killed. I Œ although even
 my friends even

friends, cannot accept that fact, somehow sa
y, well, may b e she s-somehow surv ived , 
but there is no chance. There 
was no ch ance. He was terrif
 Œ she was terrified when 
the war started, when the Germans attack
ed, and the Soviets. She was Œ we Œ I Œ 
that™s the last time I met her, and a group

, she was terrified, 
she Œ 
Q: Tell me about that. Do you reme Œ if you 
remember it, tell me 
about that last time 
you met her and wh at Œ wh at was the circumstance at that point? 
A: Well, we were g Œ two or three of us,

A: Y-Yes.

A:

 war in
 Lithuania, 
yeah, the ger Œ the Germans attacked 
Soviets, and we were looking fo r weap
ons, we wanted to fight Soviets.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We Œ we wanted to Œ since 
Lithuania
 didn™t resist w h en it was occupied, we felt 
that we just have a Œ 
Lithuania
 has a duty to, you know, to
 fight, to show that it 
didn™t accept that occupation, that we really 
want to be free, and really w Œ we were 
looking for weapons, and di
dn™t know where Œ where 
to find them. Previous 
arrangements were broken down

 going there, and the j Œ

we just saw

turning circles around Œ around

. 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: And she was at the corner 
of the center of the town? 
A: Right, right. Pretty high
 up, you know, the plane was 
there, the Russian officers 
were shooting from their pistols, and th at
 Œ it was much too high to reach in the 
plane. And 
Uditta
(ph) was also looking at that pl
ane with terrified eyes. And we 
said
, Uditta
(ph), why are you afraid, I mean, you 
Œ you Œ you did nothing, you Œ you 
were definitely Œ we didn™t even  conceive 
th at the Germans would Œ what they  did. 
We couldn™t conceive, we thought, I mean
, it™s a Œ it was a civilized nation, you 
know, a nation of the western civilization. 
We Œ we didn™t conceive that they Œ 
something like that, that they would 
do, start killing the people all, you know, 
without any discrimination, nothing. We th
ought, I mean Œ well, those who wo rked  
for the communists, those, you know, Jewi
sh or not Jewish or Lithuanian or 
whatever, they are in trou
ble definitely, but Jew Œ
 Uditta
(ph), you know, that wa Œ 
who Œ who could choo
se her, you know?  
Q: Did she say anything
 when you said that? 
A: Nothing. We Œ we tried to tell her, you 
know, that there is no reason to be afraid, 
but sh-she just listened and we saw that 
she Œ she just doesn™t believe us, and she 
was right. She was right. Yeah, I Œ I reme
mb er her, you know, I-I Œ I put Œ when Œ

when  they  were build ing th is Holo caust Museum, you know, I Œ I asked, you know, 
that her name would be inscribed in here.  

Q: Yeah. Sh e made that kind of an impact on you. 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: Yeah. I go back an
d I keep wanting Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ you know, I have the same question 
that I keep asking, which is, and wh at 
happened then, and what happ
ened then? So, if we can go 
back a little bit to when it 
Œ you know, before you talk 
about this incident with 
Uditta
(ph), your Œ the betrayal 
that I mentioned, that I brought up as a po
ssibility before, as to who was betrayed a 
feeling of betrayal, did you ever feel 
that that last independent Lithuanian 
government also betrayed you by 
not resisting, by not fighting? 
A: Yes, in a sense yes, yeah.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: In a sense, yes, yeah. Although 
that was just symbolic, of course, 
Lithuania
 
couldn™t de-defend itself, it was just too Œ to
o weak. The bases were inside already. 
But still, I think they sh
ould have fought. They
 should have fought.  
Q: Were those kinds of discussions also 
going on, and did that 
feeling of betrayal 
come once the terror started, 
or did it come once the bases started? If you can make 
some Œ that kind of a distinction, I don™t know if it™s Œ

A: No, i-i- not the Œ not the bases. 
The bases somehow was accepted as in-in-
inevitable.
 Estonia
 had that, 
Latv ia
 had that, war was goi
ng on, you know, the 
situation was unclear, how the war will 
develop was not clear. Somehow it looked 
too early to start and fight, you know, at that
 time. It Œ it looked like it™s a right thing 
to play for time. And that was playing fo
r time, but maybe we™re Œ we™re wrong. I 
mean, it would be much more effective figh
ting right Œ right there in 1939, but we 

were not Finns, we were not that organized like Finns, so 
Lithuania
 couldn™t bring 
defend also, but would be mo re Œ would 
be mo re known, you know, would have 
attracted more attention in Œ in the world. 

Q: It s Œ it sounds like what was going on in 
Moscow,
 and what people knew  in Œ 
like your family in 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
as plugged in as you were Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ to sources of information and contacts
, that what really was developing was not 

known, that Œ that people were not info
rmed. That™s the impression I get from your 
telling. 

A: Right. Yeah, right. 

Q: Of Œ of these negotia
tions, quasi-negotiations Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ that were going on.

119
A: Of course not, yeah, we didn™t know at
 that time all the details. N o w we Œ we find 
you know, the documents, that me mo irs, 
you know, we Œ we know Œ know mu ch  
more. So it Œ when I telling now the story, I 
have to watch my self
 to put myself in 
that time, n o t what I know now about those Œ the things Œ 

Q: That™s exactly Œ 

A: Œ because I have read a lot of mate
rials about those times, about negotiations, 
about decisions being taken at that time. Bu
t at that time it looked like in 1939, was 
distasteful andŒ and 
dangerous, but correct decision to accept the bases, playing for 
time. But not resisting in 1940, it seemed like 
the really was Œ was, as I say, betrayal. 
It was Œ it wasn™t a decision wh ich could be ju
stified, really. So wh
en  we were trying 
to fight the Soviets when the Germ
ans attacked, it was desp Œ because 
Lithuania
 
didn™t resist then, now we have to fight.  

Q: I see. 

A: Now we have to fight to 
show, you know, that we Œ we 
Œ we want to be free, we 
don™t want to be occu pied by anybody. 

Q: You don™t want to be part of the 
Soviet Union
. 
A: No, we don™t want to Œ to be part of the 
Soviet Un ion
, or of Œ of anything. No-
Not of 
Poland
, not for 
Germany
. We want to be independent country. Ou r parents 
fo Œ our father fought for 
that, you know, and we want
 to have an in dependent 
country. That™s Œ that was 
Œ that was the attitude.

Beginn ing Tape Four 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Algima ntas Gureckas 
on October 14
th
, 2010. Mr.
 Gureckas,
 I just 
asked you about what was the year Œ what 
was the next half year between January 
and June 1940, what events took place, wh
at things developed, but I thought of 
another question I wanted to ask, preceding 
that. And that is, of all these betrayals 
that we™re talking about: betrayal by the 
independent Lithuanian government, what 
was left of it, betrayal by 
th e, you know, small group 
of let™s say refugees from 
tsarist 
Russia
, who liked the idea of Russian domin
ation, even if it was with their 
internal enemies before, betrayal by 
the Jewish community, or betray al by 
Lithuanian Œ Gentile Lithuanians, et hnic Lithuanians, who were communists 
themselves. Which betrayal 
do you think you felt in your
 heart most keenly? Or 
maybe another betrayal? 

A: No, no. I think the Jewi
sh, because several things. 
Russian community was so 
small that it was really insignificant. Our 
government, pretty Œ find out that there 
was a split of opinion about 
that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military 
command. So Œ also, you know
, difficult. Now, Jewish, proble Œ problem is that Œ 
because maybe we were Œ or were Œ were 
mistaken, but we had the impression that 
the Lithuanian Jewish relations are very 
good. That there is no ispy Œ th-there was 
some Jewish communists, okay, you know
 Œ well, mo re than Lithuanian maybe, 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
122
percentage-w ise, but that was not rea
lly significant. The Jewish community 
supported Lithuanians in the 
Vilnius
 question. They supported 
Lithuania™s 
independence, they Œ 
Smeto na
 had very  good relations w
ith the Jewish community™s 
leaders, you know? So we didn™t see the 
reason why Œ we, as I said, maybe they felt 
being discriminated, because it was difficult 
for them, you know, to
 Œ to Œ you know, 
to become officers in the 
army, in the police, and so
mething like that. There was 
some ethnic discrimination in 
Lith uania
. But those who really wanted could, you 
know, like 
Gensis
(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian
 army, and very valued. So there 
Œ 
Q: You™re referring to 
J a kub Gens
 who ended Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Œ ended up 
being the Œ  
A: Commandant Œ 

Q: Œ chief of police of 
Vilnius
 ghetto. 
A: That™s right, that™s right. He was a L
ithuanian officer from the time of the Wars 
of Independence. He became officer in 
the Lithuanian military
 school, and had a 
very distinguish ed career in Lith
uanian army , in the war with 
Poland.
 So, just one 
example, there were other officers, Jewish
 officers in Lithuanian army . But benda Œ 
generally, 
Lithuania
 being a small country, just esta
blished, and in big tr Œ big 
conflict with 
Poland
, and with 
Germany
 because of 
Klaip
¡
da
, were looking Œ they 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
123
were discriminating not according to religion 
or race or anything like that, but about 
the perceived loyalty to the state. The mo
st discriminated people, of course, were 
Polish. They just didn™t trust any Pole th
at he wouldn™t be just a spy, you know, 
somewhere. So, for pr Œ a Pole got a gove
rnment sensitive position was practically 
impossible. Then , of course, Jews, because 
of some communists in there, you know, 
in the younger, and because 
of some cus Œ cosmopolo Œ 
cosmopolitic
 approach . A 
sophisticated approach which 
Lithuania
 looked at them kind of s-such small, 
ridiculous state, you know. Th
ey  were yus Œ universal peopl
e, they Œ they were not Œ 
not that much ag-gainst 
Lithuania
, but ri Œ but discounting 
Lithuania
. And that also 
for having some Œ somebody like that in mi
litary or police would 
seem l-like risky, 
you know, h-h-he doesn™t care about this
 country. So then, Ge
rmans. Lithuanian 
Germans ou-outside 
Klaip
¡
da
 were mostly loyal, very lo
yal, just like I told about 
that, you know, which I 
re-reme Œ remember in 
Taurag
¡
, 
Greigoris
(ph), who Œ who 
refused even to Œ to go to 
Germany
. And the same thing in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, most of the 
Germans are loyal, but Germans still, you 
know, some. And th en later, you know, 
there were Tartars and 
Karayims,
 there were no discrimi nation wh atsoever. Their Œ 
their religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, 
Karayims
 had their own religion, 
Jewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see
 Karayim
, you know, you could 
see from Œ from the face, from 
the features. Nim Œ Kara Œ Tartars not so much, was 
Karayims. 
But that didn't matter at all. Their pe
ople even in Œ in 
the army mad e the 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

124
career, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there w ere colonels, 
Karayims, 
you know. They  were as
 good or better than 
Lithuanians, no Œ no 
problem. So, the base of discrimi nation 
was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority. 
Q: Well that Œ that sort of fam
ous Œ I™m so sorry I interrupted Œ 
A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 you Œ a sort of well known se
ntiment, legitimate or not, in 
most of the cases not legitimate, o f a fifth column.  
A: Right, right. 
Q: That™s what you™re talking about. 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. An
d is Œ being, you know, aware that we are Œ the country 
was, you know, a small country , weak c
ountry in Œ in  between dangerous other 
countries. So that was one of the consid
erations, whether it Œ it was well taken or 
not, you know, that™s a different thing, bu
t that was the basic feeling. And now, 
basically, as I said, was the feelin g th
at the Jewish community was a friendly 
community and there were not really big 
conflict. There were some conflict in Œ 

commercial areas between 
Lithuania
, but the government wasn™t involved in  that at 
all.
 Smetona™s
 government was against any anti-
Semitism at all. A nd Œ and the 
people also, so Œ 

Q: And yet there was acceptable, as far as what I™ve read Œ 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

125
Q: Œ there, at least from some other histor
ical sources that there Œ the rise of anti-
Semitism throughout 
Euro pe
 in 1930s Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ did not Œ did not bypass 
Lithuania
, that as the decade 
wore on, within the 
society itself Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ there were such sentiments
. That™s wh at many historians Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ have claimed. Do you think th at ther
e Œ those are Œ outside
 of any, you know, 
any events that we™re talking about now, w
ould you say that that has validity to it? 
A: Most likely so. It™s difficult for me to
 say th Œ because we™re talking ab out the 
circle, my circle, my Œ my parents Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ my dear friends, my friends
, classmates, I didn™t feel that. 
Q: Okay . 

A: A-A-And all that circle, I din Œ didn™t
 feel that. Yes, I knew there were some 
incidents, some i-in between Lithuanian 
farmers and Œ and Œ an
d Jewish merchants, 
but it Œ yeah, there were so, there was te
nsion between Lithuanians coming in to the 
commercial area, trying to establish thei
r businesses. There is a competition, 
sometimes this competition 
went out of bounds, you 
know, from both sides. The 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
126
Jews tried, you know, to es
tablish some kind of mo -mon
opoly, and push out Œ th at 
Lithuanian out. Li-L ithuanian also, you 
know, appealing to some anti-se Œ anti-
Semitic, you know, feelings. So, apparently 
there was, but I couldn™t tell ma Œ much 
because it was way beyond my circ
le. In my circle that Œ  this
 Œ this wasn™t felt at all. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yeah, there were some Œ for instance, 
there were some Œ some Je wish famili es 
changed their house language, their family
 language from Yiddish to  Ru ssian, and 
Lithuanians resented that, you know, he Œ he
 Œ they give up Yidd
ish, why then  don™t 
Œ they don™t pick up Lithua
nian? And Yi-Yiddish didn™t
 Œ didn™t bother anybody, 
Hebrew didn™t bother an
ybody, but Russian, why Russi
an, you know? But Œ but Œ 
but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son 
Jewish speaking in 
Lithuanian. So there 
were those who did that, you kn
ow, and w-went to Lithuanian
 language. Even  in this 
museum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto
 her d Œ her diary in
 Lithuanian  because 
she Œ she ju-just didn™t know ji Œ Yiddish th
at well. So, there were Œ it was Œ it was a 
big community, it was varied situations, but ge
nerally, right or no Œ 
or not, but in the 
people there was a sen se of betrayal beca
use t h ey thought that the re lations were 
good, and they didn™t see th
e reason why th e Jewish community is acting that way, 
or much of the community
, in particular the younger generation. The older 
generation, of course, didn™t partici Œ participate in Œ in that, but as
 I said, they just Œ 
they just were in Œ behind the picture, yo
u know. Nobody cared much about the Œ the 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
127
rabbis or something like that, how Œ how th ey 
look at the things. Now, I also write in 
my memoirs that, one interesting thing that
 one of our Œ our family™s friend was Dr. 
Bridges
 family, Dr. 
Bridges, Andrew Bridges 
was a doctor, you know, his 
specialty eyes, you know, and he had so
me Jewish friends, some Je wish also 
docto rs. And during the Soviet occupation,
 the first year of Œ the first Soviet 
occupation, he-he was told by one of his 
friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish 
community leaders from the independence 
period, were concerned about this 
reaction of the younger generation, and they
 called some of the acti v e Œ well, pro Œ 
pro-co mmunist, younger, active people and ta
lked with th em, and asked them not Œ 
not to overdo th ings, that it is dangerous, 
that the Jewish comm
unity, living hundreds 
of times bet-between other nationalities, tr
ied not to become hostile to the people 
they are living between. Tried to be neut
ral, you know, and th
-th-they e Œ taking 
sides, they couldn™t have surviv ed, beca
use they would also, you know, provoke a 
lot of hostility. And they asked those younge
r generation Jews to tone down, to tone 
down . And they said the younger Œ the you
ng people just lef Œ la Œ just laughed at 
them. The old people they don™t understand
 anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-
obsolete and Œ and didn't want even to lis
ten to them. So appa
rently even
 in the 
Jewish community, there was some percep
tion that somebody is o-overdoing the 
things. Now, was Œ as I say, you know, t
hose who were against 
this reaction, you 
know, they we Œ they 
were Œ they were i-in Œ invisi
ble, they tried to be-become 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
128
invisible. No w you asking about the peri
od from Œ in early 
1940s. Really the 
breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 194
0, August, I think the third or fifth, 
about that time. Right after the annexa
tion, the thing changed. Now the terror 
intensified consid Œ considerably, and th
e resistance started getting organized. So 
now, la Œ a lot of people, even in 
Œ in Œ in Œ in Œ in my class, like 
Grimkas
(ph) and 
Ar-Arbuk
(ph) were arrested from 
resistance. But even the 
[indecipherable]
 
resistance, the people who were
 prominent in the Œ in the 
society generally, mo st of 
them were arrested, th-thousands now. No
w it became a mass thing. Now there was 
nationa Œ nationalization; the busin ess es
tablishments, commercial establishments, 

industrial things were nationalized. I was 
my -myself, we Œ we s-students had to go 
there, write, you know, in the Œ whatever 
belongs to th at merchant establishment, 
and to be nationalized with the owners. 
Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian 
owner who owns some busin ess 
or Œ or Œ or Œ or business 
establishment, they Œ they 
were just thrown out. Now the Jewish, 
usually you know, still remain there as a 
specialist. Just because usually
 there were some in the fam
ily, or in Œ in their circle 
who had influence with the new govern ment. 
So apparently they 
tried, you know, to 
help each other. And pretty ba Œ became pr
etty obvious, you know, the things are 
nationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of 

course now, in government™s name, for Œ 
in govern ment™s account, Lithuanians are 
just without a job, you know, ju st Œ ju
st waiting around. What™s the matter, you 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
129
know, it™s always the Œ these Œ these thi
ngs started accumu lating. The resentment 
against the Jewish reaction in
creased strongly. As the terr
or increased, increased the 
Œ the Œ the Œ the reaction. Also, because 
some of them, you kn
ow, even communist 
Jews went into the secu
rity e-e-establishment. 
Q: Were these people known 
by name, or was this just what was dis Œ this was 
understood, or discussed, I mean, what was th
e basis of this point of view, this Œ this 
Œ this belief that there were Jews in the security establishment? 
A: Well, they were visible. 
Q: I see. 

A: They went, they arrested 
people, they interrogated peopl
e, they Œ yeah
, th-th-they 
Œ after annexation, ev erything 
became visible. Th-They Œ 
they didn't Œ the terror Œ 
concealed terror is not a terro
r. I mean, they Œ and then th
e terror really started after 
the annexation. It really Œ what we suspec
ted, what we were afraid, now, you know, 
came to fruition. No w you didn™t have to 
be afraid, you knew. 
You knew. That™s Œ 
that™s how it is. That™s how it is, that™s 
how it will be. And it Œ it Œ it gets stronger 
and stronger, more and more peoplearrested, until the 
big deportations.  
Q: Well, tell us about the big deporta
tions. What happened then? Wh en did it 
happen, and wh at happened ? 
A: Well, it was in Œ in Œ in naja Œ I don™t 
remember exactly the da
te, but that™s 1941, 
June 14 maybe? About that, 14 - 13. Yeah
, one night, you know,
 coming Œ well, in

130
my o-op-opinion. We were walk
ing with my father through 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
There was Œ 
no, that was different, I™m sorry, that™s Œ th
at™s start of the war. Suddenly, you know, 
of Œ we Œ we got up one 
mo rning and saw that, you know
, our friends are being Œ 
being taking, arrested and be
ing taking to the railroad st
ation. I was working in the 
middle of the city, and I saw, you know, a 
Œ a Œ a truck going th
ere, you know, an 
open truck, and I saw, you kn
ow, the family we knew, wh
o was my father™s, really, 
superior for a time. We saw that family, th
e old Œ the old lady th
ere, and their girl 
and him, you know, in that truck, and sold
iers with the s-set bayonets around them, 
being taking to the railroad station. An
d Œ and a lot of people. Ou r teachers 
disappeared , you know. Our teacher o-of 
th e Russian language was a Lithuanian 
diplomat, he was arrested, there was no 
Russian class the re. He died from s-
starvation in 
Siberia. 
And so, you know, anybody could, there was no reason, there 
Œ pretty soon there was no reason Œ we coul
dn™t detect the reason who is safe. Yeah, 
well, the members of the communist party,
 and the Œ of the commu nist activists, 
those who really contributed , who we-were 
wo rking on the deportation, maybe they 
were safe, but nobody else. There was no,
 you know, anybody could be arrested, 
anybody could be deported. 
Q: Did you know at that poi
nt, wh en you saw the truck, 
the open truck, that this Œ 
this was a Œ a deportation th at was a mass 
deportation, or did yo
u see many trucks go

131
to the train station? Wa Œ can you kind of
 draw us a picture? 
What was it that you 
saw, and wh at you understood. 
A: Yeah, well, I didn™t see too ma ny be
cause mo st of them went during the 
nighttime, and I don™t know why this fam
ily was picked up Œ we
-well, there were 
more people, not only this
 family in the truck. 
Q: Yes. 

A: But th-that was like after action acti
ons, you know, something Œ people they 
might Œ might missed or something. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But pretty soon we knew,
 I mean th-the railroad stat
ion was full of people, you 
know, the trains were full, and they were
 pushing those people, w-we Œ we knew, 
you know. 

Q: Did you go to th e train station? 

A: No, I didn™t. I didn't. I-I 
didn™t want to risk be Œ be
cause I Œ we didn™t know, w-
we didn™t know Œ now we 
know, you know, aba Œ appare
ntly how that was done, but 
at that time there was no Œ no
 understanding what was goi
ng on and woo Œ who is in 
danger, who is not. My  mo ther opened  Œ and 
tr-tried to Œ to Œ to Œ to think what Œ 
what we should take to go into  
Siberia
, you know, now. And Œ and th at was open 
box, and she didn™t put anything in th Œ sh
e just Œ just was paralyzed, you know, and 
that™s it, you know, we don™t Œ we don™t 
know. We don™t know it Œ we were sho Œ 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
132
we were shocked. We were 
shocked, we didn™t expect 
anything like that. They  were 
saying, oh, your prostitu
tes are taking to Œ to 
Siberia
, they will learn how to work. 
Prostitutes, the Œ the kids, the families, you know. 
Q: Does that Ukrainian 
au pair
 still living in the house? 
A: Yeah, but Œ but they were very rarely 
at home. Th-The ka Œ th is Œ the red army  
was on some kind of alert already, so they we
re mostly at their ba
ses, wherever that 
was. 
Q: And at that point, did you co nnect the 
dots and see what she was saying, or even 
then there was such conf
usion, that you had no id
ea that this could be 
Siberia
, th e 
Siberia
 she was telling you to prepare for. 
A: Yeah, yeah, we connected that. We co
nnected. And we Œ particular the Russian 
literature, the Soviet literature we had Œ 
we had to read, you know, some of the 
Sholokhov
™
s
 novels, and th ere is about de-d epor
tations. And couldn™t understand, I 
mean, so-some Œ some silly th ing, some unrealistic thing.
 I mean, th ey come, they 
arrest the farmers there, yo
u know, they bring them to 
Siberia
, but what for, I mean, 
what did they do, and the whole family? 
Why Œ why th e whole fami ly? If the farmer 
did something wrong, you know
, hm. We di-didn™t understa
nd. It Œ it looks kind of 
silly to me, I Œ but then I 
remembered, then I remembered  that Œ that Œ that day.

A: Ye Œ oh Œ we didn™t know 
what™s going on to Œ to the ex
tent that oh, some of the 
people we know, you know, wh
en  the Œ th ey came for them to be deported, the Œ the 
father of the family, the man, ran away. 
He saw, you know, somebody coming, he 
thought they™re coming
 to arrest him, because there were so many arrests, you 
know? But n-not the fa
milies, there were people arre
sted, whoever was, you know, 
they wanted to arrest. So th
ey  ran away and ha Œ hid, an
d their fami ly was taken and 
dep Œ brought to th e railroad 
station. Now, the man realiz
ing that, came out, went to 
the railroad station, and wh atever happens,
 he wanted to be with his family. He 
didn™t realize that families were broken up, 
that the men were sent to concentration 
camps, and the families were 
sent to the Œ to the Siberi
an farms and something like 
that. So you see, even at th
e mo ment, people were so Œ that confused, didn™t know, 
you know, the method what wa
s going on. So there was no sense for him because he 
was Œ he wasn™t let to
 go with his family. 
Q: But he was taken? 
A: He was ta Œ oh, of course, yeah , he was 
taken, yeah. And very  few surviv ed there, 
i-in there, in particular the first deportation.
 But, as I say, we realized that the Jews 
are also being deported , yes, 
and quite Œ quite many of them. 
Q: How did you realize this? 
A: Well, we saw, I mean, people just di
sappearing all Œ all ar
ound you. Ma Œ my  
friend 
Rubinsteina s
(ph), his family. Ou
r Œ our classmate
 Boroka s
(ph), his family,

they are deported. They were 
lucky. They were lucky, they
 didn™t know. At that time 
we were Œ thought it means how Œ how bad,
 how cruel, but they had 50 - 50 ch ance 
of survival in
 Siberia
. My friend
 Rubinstein
(ph) survived, and
 Borokas
(ph) 
survived. They Œ 
they  would Œ I don™t know whether 
Borokas
(ph) was visiting 
Lithuania
, you know, now, and 
Rubinstein
(ph) I don™t Œ he married local girl, 
stayed there in 
Russia
. Whether he visited 
Lithuania
, I don™t know. And 
[indecipherable]
 but at that time it looked Œ the 
horro r, the same horror as for the 
others. But many Jewish activists were actin
g in that deportation. So, again, you 
know, it should have been more. The Œ 
the people still didn™t Œ didn™t quite, you 
know Œ just because Jews are being depor
ted, didn™t quite, you know, justify the 
whole Jewish commu nity because of that, be
cause the act ivists sti ll were there, you 
know. Not the only ones, but there were 
quite a few of them, quite many. Clear 
majority of the civilians taking care of th
at, except the Russian soldiers, of course. 
So Œ 
Q: So you™re saying a clear majority of
 those who participated in deportations 
happened  to  be Jewish? 
A: I would say so, I would say so. From wh
at I hear, you know, they say the Jews, 
the Jews, the Jews deported, you know, I do
n™t know. I didn't  take any samp les or 
anything like that, but from what I heard,
 yeah, it seemed so. Well, majority was 

Russian soldiers.

Later we find out th-that the Œ they just Œ

A: Oh, yeah, I remember. I was sleeping. 
I was sleeping. We

thunder, a very strong thunde

 th-there goes the picnic, 
you know, that is a thunders
torm. And then  there was an explosion. I mean, I 
thought it™s thunder, but somehow the sound 
came through the Œ through th e ground,

Q: Shook? 

A: Œ swayed . 

Q: Okay . 

A: I sh Œ no Œ stood up shock a-and went 
out outside to see what™s going on. There 
was no storm, there were no clouds

Pajuoste 
were Œ 
was the military base behind 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
there was a huge cloud going up of the 
explosion, apparently , huge cl
oud. And there were a lot of 
planes ou Œ in the sky, but 
they were high up. Now, what
™s going on here, you know
, something exploded in Œ 

in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Pajuoste
, definitely. So  Œ and then I saw, you know, it suddenly, I 
think five planes came throug

that Œ that was war. 

Q: And 
[indecipherable]

Siberia
, see? War was salvation. 
Q: For you. 

A: For us, yeah, right. Yeah.  

Q: When did you first 
see a German soldier? 
A: There were a few days ca Œ went by, 
I came back from home, and we were Œ we 
were Œ also dur Œ during the nighttime 
we went outside, there was a Œ a small 
building, really without windows, so we thou
ght rather a safe place, so we decided to 
o-over Œ stay overnight there. And we 
heard, you know, we heard cars going on, 
mo torcycles, commands, but very difficult 
to say, comm ands in an y language sounds 
similar. And suddenly a mo torcycle went th
rough our street very quickly. Most 

likely it was already the German, but we st
ayed inside until morning, and in the 
mo rning somebody come running and sa
id, Germans are 
in the town .

Vilnius, Kaunas 
[indecipherable]
, it™s surprising
 Vilnius
 was taken first,
 when Œ before
 Kaunas,
 and 
Lithuanians rewa Œ you know, to ok over 
Vilnius
 even before Germans attacked. 
Then 
Ka una s 
the same thing. But 
Panev

Warsaw
 the 22, the re Œ Lithuanian insurrection started 23, and 
Panev

rd
, and you know, it was 
Lithuanian, how did it express itself in 
Panev
¡
žy s, 
what happened there? 
A: Nothing much, the Œ b
ecause nobody had weapons, 
organization was broken 
down  by deportations. They  was supposed to
 get weapons su Œ from somewhere, but 
the people who were supposed to get those 
weapons, some of them were deported, 
the other went into hiding. On e went to 
Ka un a s , 
participated the Œ in the revolt 
there. And Œ 

Q: Were you supposed to be part of
 this, was this a resistance group Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ that you were

came back.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There was terror, you know
, they were Œ they were
 mu rdering Œ mu rdering 
people at the factory, sugar factory, tens

Well, the terror was Œ in Œ in Œ in

Q: Did you stay at home during th ese days that Œ 
A: No, no, w-we decided t Œ 
we didn't find any we-weapons

city, and Œ to see may the Œ maybe there the

 have hidden some weapons, 
maybe so. So we went there, didn™t find 
anything. Yeah, ba Œ the Soviet m-mi li Œ 
Soviet mi-military came upon, 
you know, and were ch Œ st
arting shooting at us, so 
we ran away  and hid. And we sit Œ sit ther
e for two or three days, and th en I decided 
to come back to 
Panev
¡
žy s
, and I came back and the city was kind of dead. In Œ in 
the early afternoon there were nobody watchi
ng the streets except the military patrol 
Œ patrols. 
Q: And this was Soviet still military? 
A: Soviet, Soviet, yeah, so Œ 
so when I Œ when I 
saw them or heard them, I just made 
a Œ a turnaround thro ugh other streets, 
you know, and came home, finally without Œ 
without meeting any of them directly, 
face to  face. Meanwhile, the prison was 
evacuated and many of the people were being killed at the sugar factory. But if Œ 
Q: Why were they being killed at the suga
r Œ sugar factory is just a place where Œ 
where candy was manufactured, or sugar was Œ 
A: No, sugar, sugar, sugar. 
Q: Œ sugar was manufactured? 

A: Well, it was just apparently convenient pl
ace, I don™t know, th ey just dig the Œ the 
ditches and kill the people. 
They were mostly from Œ fro

Q: So it was used as a quasi prison or a 
holding place and Œ and 
a Œ and then  became 
an execution site? 
A: Yes, I Œ I would say so, yes. 
Q: I see. 
A: But th-then the prison became empty and 
some of the prisoner 
Œ pr Œ people who 
worked in the prison

 my  mo ther. My  father was digging di Œ 
digging anti Œ anti-aircraft, you know, we
ll ditches, how do you call, you know? 
Q :  T r en ch es? 

A: Trenches, yes. So he was not home, I 
was not home, my  mo ther was home. So he 
Œ she Œ she thought that I might be a
rrested there, and they arrested. The 
NKVD
 
arrested a l o t of young people in 
the streets, including my friends. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So my fr Œ wh-w h-when  
my mother knew that, you kn
ow, the Œ was told that the 
NKVD
, the Soviet secret police left the pr
ison, she told other people in the 
neighborhood th at, let™s go there and Œ an
d let people out, you know, from the 
prison. So one of the neig
hbors brought a ladder, came 
over, you know, opened the Œ 
the gate, and went to the prison. Some of
 the prisoners were already breaking out 
from their cells, but it was very slow thing,
 so he showed  wh ere the keys are, and 
opened all the keys, and sudde
nly prison was empty. All th
is young people came out 
into the neighboring 
houses, and meanwhile 
NKVD
 came back. They Œ they  had

143
somebody guard ing, and gave
 a signal that they are 
coming back, so everybody 
disappeared and they came back
 to the empty Œ empty pris
on. Well, was too late to 
do anything, it was hours before the Germ
ans appeared. But still, you know, the Œ 
the Œ they Œ they knocked 
out a German Œ a Œ a Soviet tank somewhere you know, I 
don™t know, he was late, some 
[in d ecipherable]
. So that™s Œ that™s how Œ how it 
was. 
Q: Now, in many places, pogroms starte
d even befo re the Germans came. 
A: Right, yes.  

Q: Did th at happen in  
Panev
¡
žy s
 as far as you know? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No. 
A: No, I Œ it™s a Œ my Œ what I kn
ow, what I have seen, is limited.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I realize that, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 from what I read, was completely 
different in 
Kaunas
. The Germans came in right there and started anti-Jewish 
actions right there involving Lithuanians. In
 Vilnius
 also pretty soon like that. But 
Panev
¡
žy s
 the Germans didn™t care about anythi
ng except their military tasks, 
whatever they had. And nobody attacked Je
ws until Œ until the funeral of the doctors 
and the other people who we
re killed by the Soviets. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

144
Q: Tell us about how they were
 killed, the doctors, and th
en what was this funeral, 
when was it, and why was this a catalyst? 
A: Why the doctors were killed is Œ is
 Œ I Œ ou Œ nobody really understands. 
Q: What were the circumstances of Œ 

A: The doctors were operating on Soviet so
ldiers which were in
jured by the German 
bombing of 
Paju oste
. They were brought to the 
hospital and the doctors, the 
surgeons were working on them, operating,
 and the nurse also, 
she Œ she works wi-
with the doctors. Now, so
mebody said that somebody 
broken into the hospital 
looking for weapons, because 
the soldiers brought to 
the hospital, 
they thought 
maybe they could get weapons there. Whic
h is nonsen se, nobody brought them with 
the be Œ weapons. I me
an, they were injured 
Œ injured soldiers, so
 they were brought 
to the hospital, the weapons 
stayed wherever they were 
serving. Bu t I don™t know 
how much is rumor, how much is right, but 
in any case, there were some commu nist 
youth guards in the hospital and they teleph
oned the security that
 somebody is trying 
to break into the hospital. 

Q: That is the secret police, the Soviet Œ 

A: Secret police, yeah. And then the secret police came, took the doctors, took the 
nurse and just Œ just killed them Œ not Œ no
t just shot, but really, you know, mu rder Œ 
murdered them to Œ to deat
h, you know, by Œ by Œ by 
horrible, horrible torture. 
How? It™s Œ it™s nonsense, I mean, th
e docto rs, I d Œ I don™t know why. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
145
Q: And you found 
out about thi Œ 
A: I-It would Œ you see, the people Œ the 
people are most dangerous, and most cruel 
when they are very afraid. Ru
ssians were, at that time, th
ey were afraid. They were 
su-suddenly confronted with th e German ac
tion, wh ich was very powerful, and they 

were afraid, they Œ they Œ th
ey realized that all the su
rroundings are hostile to them, 
the Lithuanian surroundings,
 so they were terrified. And terrified people are 
dangerous people, because they are irrational 
then, and they just Œ so -so that Œ that™s 
Œ that™s my observation from that. So I Œ th
at™s how I can explain that, because there 
is Œ does Œ doesn ™t ma ke any sense, there we
re n-no weapons in 
the Œ in the hospital 
and no possibility of the weapons 
[indecipherable]
 real, you know. So so-somebo Œ 
somebody got scared, c
onfused, you know.  

Q: And so Œ and they  did away  with them.  

A: Oh, of course, yeah, then the funeral, 
bu-but not only the doctors, but also the 
people, about I don™t know, 20 - 30 people at the Œ at this sugar factory, various 
people who were arrested by securities ea
rlier. There, you know, in command, was 
that Lithuanian communist who was living 
in our house. He was in command of that 
execution. 
Q: Ahh. Ah. 
A: And th-there Œ there was different, there 
they Œ they  were executing because they 
thought, I mean, this is anti-S
oviet people. Ma Œ so then  th
 Œ not Œ not in such a fear

146
and as Œ as in the case of the doctors. 
Now, nobody until now, I never heard that 
anybody would men Œ mention that any Jew 
was involved in that. We don™t know 
Russian security personnel, maybe there 
were, maybe there were not, but nobody 
established that any Jew ba Œ th at Lithuani
an was is Œ in command, you know, at the 
sugar factory that wo  Œ 
Q: So, another betrayal of a Œ of the wo rs
t kind, is a Œ it is a Lithuanian who is a 
communist Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ who is killi
ng his own people? 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Okay . 
A: That™s right. Yeah, so Œ so there was 
no Œ no reason for any anti-Jewish action, 
but there was. After th e funeral, I went 
[indecipherable]
 they said they are beating 
Jews. Well, I went to see wha Œ wh ere, 
you know, and really we saw it, you know, 
the people were just standing and watching
. And three, maybe fo
ur, most likely three 
burly  men were hitting, you know, at the 
small houses there Œ there were Jewish s-

stores, you know, several Jewish stores at 
that place. They  were just breaking the 
windows, the doors, you know, beating it up
. And the people were just standing and 
watching wh at™s going on. Nobody said, you 
know, anything to  them, to those three 
peop-people there. Obviously they  were 
a Œ a Œ there were Jews there, you know,

147
living in  there. And suddenly a man came 
out with a bl-bloody face, apparently a 
Jew. And when  the people saw the blood, y
ou know, all this group of people who 
were standing yo Œ just stepped back, y
ou know, maybe three steps back and dis-
dispersed right there. They were calling, 
you know, to join the people, but nobody 
joined them. 
Q: The three burly men were calling to  Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ have people join  them. 
A: Yeah, but we Œ nobody 
joined, but no-nobo
dy even objected
 to anything. 
Q: Okay, so nobody 
condemned, either. 
A: No. Well, I think it was implied, condemn
ation. It was implied. People Œ people, 

but Œ 

Q: But they didn™t say anything. 

A: They didn™t say Œ they sa
y Œ didn™t say anything, yeah. 
And th ey just dispersed, 
and Œ obviously they  were sent from some
where, you know. Obviously some Œ some 
[indecipherable]
 tha-that was not s Œ anything spontan eous. Bu t Œ 
Q: Is that the first vi Œ anti-
Jewish violence that you saw Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s
? 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

148
Q: Yes? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And do you think th ere was a connecti
on between the funeral of these Œ you 
know, these people who were victims of the 
NKVD
 and that Lithuanian communist 
and whatever you know, units or rule that 
he had? Do  y Œ do you think it was just 

coincidence that it happened this way? 

A: No, not a coincidence, but
 a Œ somebody wanted to  esta
blish a relationship, which 
wasn™t there. 

Q: I see. 

A: Since nobody appro Œ nobody 
co  Œ  ev en  Œ  
even from the 
[indecipherable]
 
nobody accused that Jews were involved. In
 other places there were such a Œ such 
accusations, I read, but not in 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
Until now, nobody men
tions that any Jew 
was involved in those actions, doctors or 
sugar fac Œ factory, no. So apparently 
somebody want to make a connection, sent
 those three men there, you know, maybe 
paid them, and tried to Œ 

Q: And do you think a 
connection was made? 

A: Œ in-insight them. I don™t know. Not as 
Œ as far as me is concerned, but I don™t 
know about the other people. I don™t thin
k so. I don™t think th at even after that,

A: Oh no, several days after that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Several days after that, I don™t know
 how many Œ you know, two or Œ two Œ at 
least two, maybe three days after that
, because the Germans had time to bring 
foreign journalists fro m 
Berlin

journalists what the Ru ssians have done. 

Q: Ah, a propaganda move.

languages, and he Œ he was a re
fugee when  th e Germans took over
 Klaip
¡
da
, he 
lived in 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
But he was kind of drafted, or 
asked as a translator for the 
journalists. Journalists knew 
German, but not the real Lithuanian kn-knew German 
good enough. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he knew. So , the Germans brought 
them to those doctors and others and 
showed the places, and then later there was 
kind of like, I don™t know, like place for 
Œ for them to wait until the pl
ane was ready to take them 
back. And this Lithuanian 
translator whom I Œ who Œ was also our fam
ily friend, so he was telling us that one 
of the American journalists took him away 
and said, look, you know, this, all those 

killed people, that™s Œ that™s what the Germ
ans did, didn™t they? He said no, no, no, 
that Œ that was Soviets. Oh, he says, that™s 
Œ that™s clear, that™s 
clear, thank you. And 
then he wanted to Œ to Œ to
 talk with him and the Americ
an wouldn™t talk with him at 
all. So the German propaganda didn™t take, 
I mean, the Œ the Œ that Œ at least th is 
journalist was convinced 
that was a German  Œ 
Q: Action. 
A: Œ action. And this, from Œ from 
Klaip
¡
da
, who all his life was fig h ting against 
the Germans, and e-even until Œ he always wa
s, even after that inc Œ incident, but Œ 
but he was upset about the Œ 
th-the western prejudices.

Q: And he Œ th Œ it sounds like the wester
n journalist, the American journalist, was 
looking upon him, the translator as being 
in the service of the Germans, because it 
served the German propaganda 
privasses. 
A: Right, right. Well, apparently he was 
convinced that the Russians don™t do such 
things, 
nome
 Œ and th e Germans do. Wh ich is true
 as Œ as far as the Germans are 
concerned, just the first Œ just
 the first part not Œ not true. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. So let™s go forward. 
A: Right. 
Q: And the funeral happens, you see the Œ

houses by these three men. An

things develop fu rther? 

A: Well, horribly, because there were
 a lot of killing. Revenge killing. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: People, you know, ju-jus

youth organization or someth

hot, without any i-inquiry, 
without any court, without any pro-procedur
e, just like that, you know, and a lot of 
innocent people were just 
killed, like this Œ in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 and in su rrounding 
villages, like that. It was terrible. S o me 
of them were Jewish, I don™t know how

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Algima ntas Gureckas
, on October 14
th
, 2010. So, Mr.
 Gureckas
, 
you were with this old Œ this old co uple
 who were very frightened , old Jewish 
couple. 
A: Right. 

Q: And you had just found the co rpse of 
a young man in their shed. Do you think 
there was a connection betwee
n this young man and them? 
A: I think so . I think h-he might have been th
-their son, or Œ or a close relative, but I 
Œ I didn™t enquire that, and I thought, you know Œ 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I ch Œ I shouldn™t. I mean, 
we were Œ we just Œ just Œ maybe not, I 
don™t know. 

Q: So that was your fourth
 Œ that was your fourth Œ 
A: Task. 

Q: Œ task. And you returned
 to your headquarters? 
A: My headquarters, gave the pistol, the 
am-ammunition, gave the money, gave the 
note and the translatio n, and that was a da
y™s work  done. So went back home with 
my friends, and my father met us with 
the Œ a toast for a free and independent 
Lithuania
, which we thought it™s being establis
hed now, because all the city was

October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
161
just in Lithuanian national colors, and th
e flags, except for 
one building where the 
German commandant was Œ took ove
r the place. So Œ so tha 
Œ at that pla Œ what we 
thought is going Œ going to 
happen, there will be, well ma
ybe not quite 
independent, 
but something like
 Hungary
, or Œ or
 Slovakia
, something like that, you know, that 
we will Œ will be independent c
ountry together with Œ with 
Germany
, you know, 
allied willingly or not. And then
 the other day, I went to the police, I don™t know 
why, do-don™t rememb er exactly, went to 
the police, and Œ but 
I remember the view, 
which was very shocking to  me. There was an old man, apparently a Jew, an old 
man, you know, and he was standing like in
 the corner, and on
 his forehead was 
written in, I would say maybe it looked lik
e wet ashes, you know, make something 
like that and then smear on that, and it was called 
žy d a s. 
Q: In Lithuanian. 

A: In Lithuanian. 

Q: So that means Jew. 
A: Jew. 
Q: And he was inside the police station? 

A: And he was inside the police station, wa
s standing in the co
rner, the people were 
going around th eir business there, you know,
 nobody was paying any attention to 
him as far as I could see. I don™t know, I Œ I ju
st left that police a
nd j-just stays in my  

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
162
memo ry, you know, bec-because it was such 
a shocking, shocking view for me, for 
me. 
Q: Was he Œ do Œ was he Œ 
you say he was an old man, do you reme mb er what he 
looked like? Was he small, was he large? 

A: No, he was small, he was bald, yeah. That
 Œ that Œ that was very shocking to me, 
that™s why I remember it. Well, I went back
 home, then didn™t ha
ve any di Œ nothing 
when I went to staff, they 
had nothing for me for awhile. We met so me German s, we 
drank with them. My school German became
 conversational, but 
my Œ when we are 
Œ get drunk, you don™t have inhibitions, so it™
s mech Œ much earlier Œ easier to learn. 
The Germans were very friendly,
 the soldiers. They were Œ 
they were soldiers, that™s 
all they c-cared, you know, they wer Œ th ey were fighting their Œ the war, and no 

politics, nothing her-here. They were frie
ndly people. Now, anot
her day I went, and 
they had another task to me. And th e Ru
ssians Œ the railroad was a regular western 
European railroad in 
Lithuania
, th e width. The Ru ssian railroads had different 
width. So when  the 
Russians took over, th
ey made a more wide, you know, on the Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, a wider 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ the Russian Œ a Russian standard. Now,
 the Germans wanted us to bring it back 
to the west European, 
German, or previous Lithuanian  st
andard . So I had to Œ to Œ to 
go to  the prison. There was prisoners 
of war, Russians, Soviets, you know, 
Ukrainians, whatever. I had to take 120 - 15
0 of them and bring to th e railroad, and 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
163
let them work on the railroad bringing the 
Œ the Œ the rail width to  the regular side. 
And, to watch wh at Œ with my  friends al
so, to watch th em, you know, work ing there. 
So that™s what we did. 
Q: So you guard ed th em, in other word s. 
A: We guarded them, yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And they were Œ they were working there.
 It was easy  Œ well, of course, not very 
easy, easy because th-there were, you know, 
before, that width, so it was just re-
return to the old place. And it was narrowe
r, so it™s no problem, n-no Œ no Œ no need 
to extend anything or someth
ing. But, you know, the rails 
are heavy, you have to Œ to 
lift them an d bring it, and so  
Œ so it was w-work, you know 
[indecipherable]
 many 
of them. Now, I was the control. The Ukrain
ians were very happy people there. They  
were, you know, full of fun, you know, they
 Œ they had all kinds of funny stories, 
and I s-started, you know, to talk with them. 
Q: In Russian? 
A: In Russian, yeah. 
They said, you know, 
all Œ they were all 
happy. They  knew  the 
war was over, will be over in mo
nths, they go back to free 
Ukraine,
 everything will 
be just fine. And I saw that I lost, I mean
, you know, a war discipline, they Œ th ey are 
not work ing, they are just
 entertaining me. So, I ha
d problem, you know, until I 
[indecipherable]
 on them to work. Th
e Russians were very up 
Œ not very, but they 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
164
are upset, sad, you know. They were working,
 but obviously they Œ th ey Œ they  were 
not happy, not like Ukrainians, it™s Œ it™s a 
very big difference between. There were 
other nationalities. There was one of
 them, they knew
 no Russian.  
Q: But it was a Soviet soldier? 
A: It was a Soviet soldier, he was from 
Kaukas
(ph) or somewhere, th-the Russians 
told me, he is from 
Kaukas
(ph), so he doesn™t know a
ny Russian. Yeah, so I don™t 
know who he was, but di Œ you showed  to 
him, he-he did, you know, whatev er. They 
never Œ I wa Œ I never asked them, but th
ey never complained, th-they Œ I never 
asked how they are fed or something like th
at, but apparently there were no problem, 
because nobody complain
ed to me that they didn't  
have hot food or anything.
 
Q: How did they look? 
A: They look alright to me. 
There is just a few days Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ they became p-prisoners of war. They
 were under Lithuanians, not under the 
German rule. The Germans so
me Œ somehow, you know, they are supposed to  be 
under the Germans, you know, but they were 
under the Lithuanian s. So they  working 
several days, we were working at that™s Œ 
that™s rail Œ rail somehow is re-established 
the Œ the discipline with Œ w
ith a difficulty with my Ukra
inian friends. And finally, it 
was going fr Œ really fast, you know, the Œ 
the work  was done, some distance from

Q: At that point. 
A: Yeah, without point. Let me tell you, 
at that point Œ withou
t Œ without Œ without 
any shot being fired from my  gun, I Œ I 
didn't Œ didn™t have any Œ no need, no 
opportunity. I wasn™t in any fi-fighting in 
the action, nothing. So  I came back home 
and just was waiting until the Lithuanian ar
my will be reestablished, we will be 
mobilized and we™ll be sent to fight the Œ th
e Soviets together with
 the Germans, just 
like Finns, like Hungarians, 
Italians, Bulg arians are doing. So th at was the big 
illusion, you know, and no 
Œ no Germans didn™t Œ didn™
t want any Œ any of our 
services, and Œ of
 Lithuania™s 
service. Now, as far as th
e Jews are concerned, until 
that, you know, nothing happ
ened except for those p-pr
evi Œ early executions. The 
early executions, of some of the com Œ my
 communist friends, you know, that Œ who 
were in the communist youth organization, fl

who lived in our house and 
who was participating in executions at the Œ 
Q: Sugar shack. 
A: Œ sugar factory. And th-those come Œ 
those communist youth people, they  Œ they 
got rifles, they were Œ had 
weapons, and they were f-fleeing together with the red 
army, retreating. The Germans, well, you 
need map really. The Germans went one 

way from 
K-Kaunas
 to 
Dofilis
(ph) in 
Latvia, Pskov 
in Russia, directly towards 
Saint Peterburg; Leningra d
, at that time. 
Q: Mm-hm, exactly. 

A: But one f Œ another 
was big Œ big move from 
Pilzzeit

Riga
, and farther away into 
Estonia
. And 
Panev

 is in 
between. So they were fleei
ng toward north, not toward the east. O f course, toward 
the east the Germans were already advanc
ing there. They fled to Œ reached 
La tv ia
, 
J

 which is on the 
Daugava

are Œ the German tanks are going. Appare
ntly  Œ the co mmunists apparently, for 
instance, this communist who 
lived  in our house, de Œ he survived . He Œ he e Œ he 
escaped. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: He escaped, because he 
later was parachuted into
 Lithuania
, caught by the 
Germans and Œ and hanged by the Germans. 
And so he Œ he escaped , but then of

course was thrown back as a paratrooper. 
But my f Œ but the y
oung friends from the 
communist youth th ought it™s Œ it™s hopeless. 
They said that they
 threw their rifles 
into the 
Daugava
 river, and walk ed back  to 
Panev
¡
žy s
. Well, it took couple of 
weeks, I guess, until they arrived back
. Nobody was interest
ed, nobody bothered 
them, nobody en quired  about them, nothing. 
If they wouldn™t have fled, they would 
have shot. They wo
uld have killed. 
Q: They would ha
ve been killed. 
A: The first Œ first day, yeah. Such people like them, they were killed first day, no 
questions asked. Wh at a difference two w
eeks made. Nobody was interested, nobody 
even asked them where they were. 
Q: Or who they were. 
A: Or who they were, yeah. 
They lived just normal life.
 One of them™s living in  
Klaip

da
 now, raising his family, that™s Œ 
he was Russian, yeah, ethnic Russian. 
Yeah, so. 
Q: So, you Œ you fired not a 
single shot from your rifle? 
A: Not a single shot. 
Q: But you said that some who di
d join this national guard, the 
−a ulia i
, you had 
heard that they had been 
implicated in murders Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ and in massacres.

168
A: Right. 
Q: What is it that you he
ard, and did you know of
 these people personally? 
A: Well, there™s the problem. I think when 
they were killing the 
people, they thought 
they doing some kind of a 
heraic Œ 
heroic work. But they very quickly found out 
that everybody looks very, you know, agai
ns Œ ev-everybody™s we Œ very  mu ch 
against that, and they condemne
d such a t Œ such a action. 
So they didn™t
 brag about 
that any more, and so I just heard the rumo
rs, yeah, from my cla
ss, a b out one, yes, 
but it™s a rumo r, he never talked about anyt
hing like th at, so I Œ I don™t know. I can™t 
accuse him, because this is te
rrible accusation, and well, he
 is killed. H-He is killed 
by th e Œ by the s Œ by the Soviets, but Œ on
 second occu pation, he Œ th ey fo und his 
remains in ter Œ what does Œ near 
Vilnius
 there, the burial place. But Œ but I don™t 
know. Just a rumor about him.  

Q: But when we™re talking a
bout massacres, are we talki
ng ab out massacres of Jews, 
or are we talking about revenge shooting 
of communists, some of whom might be 
Jewish, some of whom would not be? 

A: I imagine that it™s Œ it™
s killing of the communists. 
Q: I see. 
A: Yeah. Jews and not Jews. 
Definitely not Jews, because we know, I mean, who are 
killed. As far as Jews are concerned, we di
dn™t have that many people so we identify, 
you know, how many and where.
 I sa Œ would suspect that the Jews had the worst

chance to su rvive in the Œ th
an the Lithuanian communists.
 Well, Lithua Œ be Œ if 
they decided to kill, I mean, there was no 
chance any more. You know, they decide, 
this is a communist, let™s shoot him. And th
ey  shot Œ shot him. But I think they  had 
stupid errors, you know, of killing people 
who were not communi
sts, could happen 
for the Jews much easier, because Œ 
Q: Of the suspicion? 

A: Sus-Su sp icion and not knowing the comm
unity  that well. In Lithuanian case 
pretty mu ch well Œ was known who was, yo
u know, wa Œ involved
 that much. So I 
suspect that maybe more Jews. But anyway
, they were not killed, there were not 
mass executions like later. There were not 
executions of children, wo men. Well, 
women, unless they themselv
es were implicated, but Œ 
but not like, you know, the 
whole families or something like that. Just
 Œ just thought he™s a communist, a Jew a 
communist, we™ll kill him, kill him. That™s my
 impression. I Œ I wasn™t close to those 
things, I saw Œ well, it™s difficult to say, 
but it was definitely not Œ not a mass ex Œ 
extermination of the Jews Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ at that point, yet. 
Q: At wh at point did that start? Let™s go Œ let™s go to th is point

A: Oh yeah, well, that™s another story. Sin
ce Œ you know, it became a pr Œ as far as I 
was concerned, became a quiet
 time, you know, no Œ no Œ no 
service in the Œ in the 
mi Œ of military or police or anyt
hing like th at, I th
rough with that. 
Q: You™re finished with high school. 
A: You™re finished with high school. So
 my  frien d  fro m my  Œ  fro m my  s Œ  clas s, 
asked me to come to the village to be a gues t in his sister™s Œ sister™s ba Œ wedding. 

And so we went, I went with
 Œ to my  Œ near Œ near 
Biržai
, his Œ his village, and 
there was a very si Œ big 
wedding, you know, a lot of 
Biržai
 beer, which is very 
good, very, you know, homemade. Fine, so we
 celebrated there. Now, after that, he 

decided to  show me the 
Biržai
 and the Œ and the area around, area where he was 
born and grown and he wanted to  show me. Well we went to 
Biržai
, went, met the 
girls there, was nice. And the last day 
before I-I came home, we were walking 
through his village. There were no buildings 
around, there were fields and roads, and 
there came a man on a bicycle. And this man 
came to a Œ both of us and said, do you 
know? 
Biržai
 Jews are Œ have been killed. We 
were shocked, I mean, wha-what Œ 
what do you mean? He didn™t say hello or 
anything like that, that
 was the first words 
he said, do you know? 
Q: A total stranger, yes. 
A: Total stranger. Do  you know the 
Biržai
 Jews were killed? No. We were Œ we 
were shocked. And he starte
d telling, he Œ he just ha
d to tell that the German

171
commandant, the German militar
y said Œ the Jews were in
 the ghetto already. He 
said that they found, the Germans foun
d that the Jews had hidden  weapons, and 
because of that, you know, he
 t Œ took all the Jews, and 
brought to someplace, you 
know, outside the city, and th
ey just killed all the Jews
. All, he said. Children, 
babies. The German officer was w alking ar
ound and sh ooting babies in the mo thers™ 
hands. Whether he participated or not, I don
™t know, but he was shocked. At least he 
was apparently guarding, or so. He was Œ 
he Œ eyewitness. No question about that. 
Q: What would have made you think that he
 might have participated in it, or in Œ 
been involved in some way? 

A: I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I don™t know. I Œ 

Q: But he was an eyewitness, at any rate. 

A: He Œ well, yeah, he was telling with 
details everything what was going on. He 
was telling about the doctor who was not brou
ght to the Œ he was so m Œ valued that 
they didn™t bring him to the Œ the ghetto, 
he still stayed at his home and his office. 
And the Germans came to pick him up and bri
ng with  the other Jews, and he said no, 
he is not going anywhere. And th e Œ well, 
the German officer pulled out the pistol 
and just shot him right there in his office. 
And thi-this is Œ they said, I mean, th ey 
just put him in Œ in the truck and brought 
to the execution plac
e and threw in with

the others. And he Œ he described the executi
on in great detail. He said, the ra Œ re Œ 
Germans were killing, Lithuanians were k
illing also there, the Œ those Jews, you 
know, and he Œ he told him pa
rticularly he Œ the ch Œ the 
killing of the babies for him 
you Œ was Œ was Œ was the thing, I mean, he
 just couldn™t Œ he said, after that, I 
mean, he Œ he just resigned from Œ from the se
rvice, and he doesn™t want even to see. 
Q: Was he a policeman? 

A: Well, like auxiliary policeman at that time, not a regular in 
uniform or anything 
like that, no. Tho-Those are Œ were not invol
ved in Œ in Œ in usually in Œ in Jews™ 
execution. But that was Œ we were shocked 
also, hearing that. And we thought that™s 

Œ it™s a unique thing, as I read in 
Napoleon™s
 biograp hy right befo re going there, you 
know. Th Œ having time I just 
picked up a book and read 
Napoleon™s 
biograp hy. 
And there is an incident where 
Napoleon
 killed the prisoners of war in Œ in
 
Akah
(ph), in Œ in Œ today 
Israel,
 at that time Turkish
 Palestine. 
And even, I 
thought, I mean, even Œ even 
Napoleon
, whe Œ really a reasonable military leader, he 
did things, and I thought well, 
Biržai
 will be also in history like
 Jaffa, 
you know, 
some cruelty wh ich happens during th
e war, you know, without any reason, 

something Œ well, what do you mean, I m
ean Jews were hiding weapons. Maybe 
they were hiding weapons, but somebody prep
ared even the ditche
s for the Œ for the 
Œ for th Œ for them to be k
illed, you know, before that. So
 s Œ must be just Œ just a 
pretense. So, we Œ we thou
ght that something what™s ha Œ wh at™s happened in

Biržai
, the Œ we Œ I went back to  
Panev
¡
žy s
, you know, and then  
I found out no, this 
thing is going all around. And th
en we found out not only in 
Lithuania
 but in 
Latv ia
 also. Hm. Now Œ then we 
[indecipherable]
 we saw, in our gymnasium, in 
ou-our high school came a German detachme
nt, not the regular military, I don™t 
know, the uniforms were somewhat different
, they have digging equipment a lot, and 
there was Œ they will kill
 Panev
¡
žys
 Jews also, the rumor was there. And of course 
we believed because we 
knew what happened in
 Biržai
. It was terrible. By the way, 
I bir Œ didn™t mention how the ge Œ ghetto 
was established, fairly early, but not th e 

first day, not e Œ not even the first week. The Germans had all kinds of 

announcements, and telling wh at to do, retu
rn the weapons, this
, that, you know, all 
kinds of things, and u-underneath  it was Œ my
 friends said, you know, if Œ if it™s not 
written 
[indecipherable]
, we™ll Œ we™ll executed Œ th em Œ it™s Œ  
Q: We™ll be shot. 

A: Œ yeah , we™ll shot. Not Œ not worth even re
ading, but if it says we™ll shot, at least 
I read it. B u t there was another announ
cement with Œ not in
 German format, 
establishing a ghetto in 
Panev
¡
žy s,
 and requiring to wear this yellow star. Not to 
walk on the sidewalks, all this thing. I 
cannot remember, I™m so
rry I can™t remember 
who signed that, whether it was a Lithua
nian mayor, or was a German officer, I 
cannot remember who Œ who 
is Œ un-under whos
e authority was written Œ although I

174
know that in some cases Germans printed, a mayor wh o didn™t sign. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It doesn™t matter. 
A: But doesn™t matter, 
but I don™t know in 
Panev
¡
žy s
, under whose authority it was 
announced . And the ghetto was established.
 At the beginning, the idea of ghetto 
didn™t seem such terrible, because we th
ought about medieval ghettos. Jews living 
separately, but well, we imagined, you 
know, we knew that there were ghettos
 
in 
Poland
 already. We Œ we imagined that there 
Œ I mean, the Jews are Œ had in  there, 
their establishments, professionals, you can 
go there, buy things
 with th Œ from the 
Jews. You can go to the docto
r, Jewish doctor, you can go to the lawyer. And then 
[indecipherable] 
they live just separately
. So, not that bad. Bu
t when the ghetto was 
established, it wasn™t the medieval ghetto, 
it was Œ everybody was crowded in, in the 
small place, tak Œ they didn™t work in th
eir professions, they had to wo rk outside, 
you know, s-simp le some 
Œ digging or something. 
Q: Did you see people being moved into th e ghetto? 

A: No, I didn™t see that. I saw people that 
were working on Œ on 
the street with the 
yellow Œ 
Q: Star. 
A: Œ with  the yellow star. And that also 
was Œ made a negative impression on th e co 
Œ the Lith uanian people in 
Panev
¡
žy s. 
Tha-That™s Œ that™s too cr
uel, that™s to o cruel. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

175
Maybe the Jews did wrong things, maybe th
ey deserved  some kind of punish ment, 
but this Œ th is was too mu ch. And there was a organization, I know, because my  
mo ther knows her Œ he Œ she wasn™t pa-part 
of the organization, but her good friend, 
this doctor I talked, Dr.
 Bridges
, who talked with the Je
wish doctors about, you 
know, the action of the young Jews during 
Soviet occupation, his wife, and other, 
mo stly from Catholic organizations, made a Œ 
a circle to  help the Jews in the ghetto. 
First of all, there was not enough food 
for them. There was some fo od, but not 
enough. So thif Œ that™s first thing what th ey  get for, you know, to  Œ to bring food to  

the ghetto. Ghetto was guarded 
by Li-Lithuanian au-auxiliaries. 
Q: So the same sort of auxiliaries as this man who was on a bicycle from 
Birža i
? 
A: Exactly. Exactly the same. 
But th-they Œ they didn™t car
e. They Œ th-they Œ they 
cou Œ you could bring bread 
and soda, th-they didn™t want, you know, to Œ to  bri Œ 
they were supposed not to let to 
[indeciphera ble]
 they just didn™t care. And they 
said, well, we Œ we Œ we buy th em, 
you know, some vodka, you know fo r this 
service, but Œ they didn™t ask for that, but
 it™s Œ so Œ but th -there were quite many 
Jews, and I don™t know, I Œ I Œ I just dou
bt very  mu ch that everybody got enough 
food f Œ by this smuggling, 
but Œ but some, you know, ap
parently held, because it 
was a rather Œ a rather ma Œ many la Œ wo
men were involved in  that, so I suppose 

there was Œ it was Œ it was sensele ss. I m
ean, wa Œ it was something which was a-ab 

Œ effective to some Œ some degree. And th
en, you know, came th
at Œ that day of 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

176
execution. And the rumor went around that 
tomorrow the Jews will be killed. First of 
all, I heard about that from 
thos Œ these auxiliaries. Some
 of th-those auxiliaries 
came to my  friends and said, we are not go
ing to kill anybody. We are not killers, we 
are not going to kill anybody. 
If they force me for such 
Œ into some executions, we 
are going to Œ to flee from the service.
 And they asked my  friends, you know, 
whether we could arrange for them to hide until they coul
d go out of the city toward 
their villages, and hide there, but right 
now where Œ when they
 ha Œ when they 
escape from this. So apparently Œ 
by the way, h-here the Bishop of
 Panev
¡
žy s
 comes 
in. He also heard those rumors and in one 
Sunday Œ I wasn™t in Œ in the ch Œ in th e 
church , it™s Œ I regret at the time, not a dire
ct witness, but the whole city was talking 
about that, that the bishop 
s Œ talked about thou sho Œ sh
all not kill, and he really 
condemned those who™d kill in
nocent people, and excommunicated them in advance. 
Those who kill innocent people, or yo
u have killed innocent people he 
excommunicated and Œ and c
ondemned them, not by name, because some of them 
that just didn™t do that yet. But, as a Œ 
as a category of people, 
of Œ of killers. A nd Œ 
Q: And he was talking abou
t the massacre of the Jews, 
the ongoing massacre of the 
Jews? 
A: Yes, and other innocent people, but Œ 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
177
A: Œ but he was talking abou
t the Jews. No Œ nobody ha
d any doubt, including the 
Germans, because the Germans 
reacted. They arrested the bi
shop, put in Œ 
in Œ in the 
house arrest, and said that he is removed 
from his Œ from his duties, and he has to 
leave
 Panev
¡
žy s 
altogether. Okay, so he left 
Panev
¡
žy s
 altogether. He had the villa 
in 
Berciunai
, a few kilometers from 
Panev
¡
žy s
, and Œ a small resort, and he went to 
his vil Œ to this villa. But he didn't resign 
from a bishop™s duties,
 he Œ from the villa 
he just did his old work  as a bishop. A
nd Lithuanian ad ministration covered it up, 
you know. So he Œ he was th
ere, you know, and I know Œ 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Casimira s
 
Paltarokas
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: 
Casimira s
 
Paltarokas
. And so  Œ 
Q: So did these Œ did these auxiliaries w
ho came and asked to 
be hidden until they 
could return to their villages, did that
 succeed? Were they able to run away? 
A: No. I asked after this Œ this thing, yo
u know, my  friends wer 
Œ did they? No, they 
said, they didn™t need to. There was no 
Œ no need. There were
 enough, those who 
went willingly, and those who refused were 
left alone, but all of them resigned from 
the service then, because we ha
ve Œ they didn™t want to be 
associated even with this 
Œ the killers, the people. 
So th Œ at least in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 there was no Œ no Œ well,

pressure maybe, but not Œ not really somethi
ng, you know, forcin g to participate in Œ 
in Œ in executions. 
Q: So, in  other word s, those Lithuanians wh o did participate Œ 
A: Did willingly. 
Q: Œ did it willingly. 

A: Apparently yeah, that™s
 Œ that™s the conclusion. 
Q: And when di Œ do you rememb er what
 month the ex ecutions started, when  the 
Panev
¡
žy s
 Jews were liquidated? 
A: I di Œ I don™t remember now. I have on my Œ on my  memo irs Œ 
Q: Was it Œ or was it in the su
mmer, was it in the early fall? 
A: Oh su mmer, summer. Late summer, 
I would say. Maybe late August. 

Q: Mm-hm. So two or three Œ 

A: Yeah, late August, I would say. 

Q: So we™re saying June, two or Œ 
A: No, maybe September already. Well, but 
not Œ not Œ not later 
than that. Late Œ 
Q: So tw o or three months af
ter the Germans have invaded? 
A: Less, because half a month June, 
and July Œ yeah, two, two months. 
Q: Two months? 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

179
A: About two months, yes. Appare
ntly ki Œ i-in other places of 
Lithuania
 what I 
read, you know, there were executions 
of various kinds mu ch earlier. But 
Panev
¡
žy s
 
was a quiet place, and Œ until 
the Germans took over, and Œ 
Q: Did you see Œ after those rumors, wasn™t 
it true that actually
 the next day th at 
happened , or the few days afterwards it happ
ened Œ I mean, in ot
her words, were the 
rumors fulfilled? 
A: Which way? 
Q: I mean, there Œ sometimes one can hear
 that there are rumors and it doesn™t 
happen that week, it ha
ppens the week after. 
A: No, no, it happened that, because it Œ th
ere were Œ they brought Œ they were 
telling a story, they brought Ru ssian prisoner
s of war to dig the ditches for that. And 

when  they  gave the dimensions of the ditc
hes, the Russians threw Œ threw off their Œ 
their shovels and they refused. Because they  were Soviet, people they knew, that™s Œ 

that™s for their Œ for execution.
 And they assumed for them.  
Q: Oh. 

A: And the Germans finally te
ll them that that™s for Jews
, not for you. They didn™t 
believe it. They  didn™t believe it. They  had 
to take their equipment, whatever, dig the 
ditches themselves, or hired sa Œ I don™
t know, but the Russians wouldn™t do th at.

Q: Yeah, you know Œ 
A: They Œ yeah, well it™s Œ it™s na Œ it™s Œ 
it™s Œ it™s terrible, it™s terrib le. The day 
when the executions started was someho
w very strange, you know. Nobody was 
talking, people just didn™t talk. People 
Œ people stopped talking, you know, it was 
kind of Œ my self, I went, you know, to s Œ 
visit my  friend, who lived  near the Œ the 
street where the road
 was leading toward 
Pajuoste
 where the executions were taking 
place. And the trucks full of Œ of Jews, I s
uppose, full of people were just going that 
direction. 

Q: Did you see this? 

A: Yes. And to his Œ with my  class friend,
 we just looked, and didn™t say anything. 
Didn™t say anything because what Œ wh
at can you say? Wh at can you say? 
Q: So it™s like the whole city knows. 
A: Yes. 

Q: The whole city knows. 
A: Oh yeah, the whole city knew, defi
nitely. And the reaction was horrified, 
horrified. I don™t know what Œ whether a
ll of them, of course, maybe o-ob Œ 
obviously, th ere should have been  people
 who approved. Af-After all, there were 
people who participated. But generally, yo
u know, wh en you go to  the city and see 
the people, you Œ you can see that ever
ybody™s kind of like 
paralyzed from horror, 
what™s going on. You ga Œ the Œ the Œ 
any revenge, anything about the Jews was

forgotten by that time, long
 ago. When the Jews were 
brought into the ghetto, you 
know, the Lithuanians, th-that Œ that was 
the end. The Lithuanian s didn™t Œ didn™t 
approve of that; a ghetto as 
it was established there, didn™
t approve of that, and so Œ 
but yeah, that™s Œ that is a 
terrible, a terrible th ing. Yeah, we Œ we went then, after 
the execution, oh several, several weeks afte
r the execution, and we went to a farm 
where one of our friends had th e girlfriend i-
in that farm. The farm was nearest farm 
to the execution place. And we wanted to fi
nd out. We Œ we knew, I mean, it Œ it was 
a horrible thing happened of a gur Œ trem
endous significance. Wanted to find out 
wa-wa Œ wh-what Œ what it was. And they said
 well, the girl couldn™t tell us anything 
because when the executioner ca
mes, the fa Œ th-the Œ the 
parents, they say, hid her. 
Told  her to go upstairs, yo
u know, and the Œ and to  hi
de, and because those Œ the 
killers were going around the 
co Œ the house drinking wa
ter, vodka, everything. But 
we didn™t really, in su
ch a detail as this from 
Biržai
 told, there was nothing Œ 
nothing Œ nothing. The same
 thing, the same Germans 
and Lithuanians. German 
officer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there™s some resistance of the 
executioners to kill babies, so 
the officer had to take them
 up on himself. I™m just Œ I 
suppose, that Œ that™s my  deduction. 
The story was told 
that, you know, one 
Lithuanian officer was married
 to a j Œ Jewish girl, and wh en the Jews were brought 
to the ghetto, he went together with he
r. Lived together with her, and when  they

182
brought to th e execution, he went togeth er
 with her. And he was told, you know, to 
go out Œ go away, you know. He 
refused, he went with his wife and was killed there.  
Q: So you got as close as to the 
farm next to the execution site? 
A: Right, yeah, wa Œ th e group of us. 
Q: The group of us. Bu t you di
dn™t go to the execution site? 

A: Nah, no. 

Q: No. 
A: No. Then they said, you 
know, at the end of the ex
-execution it looked like they 
became insane. They were dr
inking vodka, complaining th
at th-they Œ they cannot 
get drunk, you know, no matter how mu ch  vo
dka they  drink. And at the end, you 
know, it was starting g-getting at dusk, you 
know. And some of them started going Œ 
the Œ the Jews had to disrobe, they will st
art going through thei
r Œ within they had 
hidden so me Œ some valuables there, some
 gold or wh atever, some started going 
through those Œ their Œ their Œ their clothe
s. And one of them, of the executioners, 
one of them said that you™re not supposed  
to that, you know, that
™s Œ that™s supposed 
to leave, you know, for the Œ for the Œ for 
the Œ the Germans, you know, to take care 
of it. So what they did, th
ey just shot him and threw hi
m together with the Jews in 
the Œ in the Œ in the Œ 
in th Œ in the ditch. Now, this is
 true Œ true story, because about 
year, or Œ or couple of years ago, my
 friend came to me  and said, you know Œ 
wanted to check with me his tran slation of 
a request of a mo ther of those Œ th at who

was killed there. He was asked Œ she was 
Œ wanted to translate into German, was 
asking th e German authority to  let dig up th
e grave, find the remains of her son and 
remove it and bring it to Œ to its Œ a regular
 cemetery. So, I saw that Œ that letter, 
which my  friend has translated, we looked at
 the translation. So
 I Œ I doubt very 
mu ch a German would have approved that
, I don™t know what happened with  that 
story, but apparently that story is right.  

Q: So that means the one 
who was there, who was sayi
ng you can™t go thro ugh the 
clothes Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ this was his mother. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: I see. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: How many Jews were there in 
Panev
¡
žy s
? Do you know, approximately? Are we 
talking 10,000, are we talking Œ 

A: No, ab out s-s 7,000 - 8,000, some
thing less than 10,000 I would say. 
Q: And in 
Biržai
, did you have an  idea? 
A: Less. Considerably less, but I know
, because the city is much smaller. 
Q: Smaller. 

A: But I Œ I Œ I don™t know, I don™t know.

Q: After this, did you hear of other su
ch massacres throughou
t the countryside? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah? What did you hear after the 
Panev
¡
žy s
 massacre? How did Œ how did the 
next several days play out? Wh en  
did people start talking again? 
A: Pretty soon, I suppose, but
 they were still ob-obsessed by
 that, and were Œ really 
came back to that theme. I wa
s working at that time. I took
 a wa Œ a Œ a jo Œ a job in 
the municipality of 
Panev
¡
žy s
. We see Germans introduce 
the food Œ food cards.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We were supposed to get that mu ch
 food, you know, for Œ and the Œ this Œ 
everybody had to get those cards. Now, it™
s tremendous operatio
n, you know, every 
people have to get those cards in 
Panev
¡
žy s
. Tremendous lines and Œ and lots of 
time. So they hired people, I was one of
 them, and many of my  friends, to bring 

those to the people. We got those food ca
rds, we had lists of people who live and 
how many, and we were bri
nging those cards to the peop
le themselv es, so they 
wouldn™t waste time getting those cards. So
 it was very interesting because I knew 
pa Œ pa Œ got to know 
Panev
¡
žy s
 as never before. You know, all kinds of people 
from all professions, all Œ all social leve
ls, y ou know, all nationalities, except the 
Jews. Except the Jews. Yeah. An
d so I brought those cards. Most of the people, you 
know, just signed for it, a-and I go to th
e next house and so 
on. But some of the 
people were talkative. An
d Œ and some Œ and all Œ not always, but many of the 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

185
people were bringing up th is Œ the execution 
of the Jews, and all negative. I suppose 
that those who were for it, wouldn™t start 
the discussion at all. I just met one who Œ 
who was that, you know. 
Q: In the bringing of these cards around 
you mean, or in general you just met one 
person? 

A: He Œ he Œ he Œ he
 Œ let me  see, did I bring a Œ a 
cards? Exactly thinking, I think I 
was bringing the cards, but he was outside, 
or he was visiting that fa-family, and I 
didn™t give him the cards, just the regular 
Œ the residents. And 
I don™t know, he was 
officer in Lithuanian  army  or Œ or what, 
I don™t rememb er his Œ his profession, but 
he said that his Œ he was one of those, 
when  the deportations started who Œ who ran 
away to hide because he 
thought th-they are coming for him. And his family was 
deported. He Œ hi-his wife and two daught
ers. And he was convinced that the Jews 
were in that group, and he said he is going
 to Œ to participate 
in killing of the Jews. 
But I doubt very much, because he  was tellin g when the Jews in 
Panev
¡
žy s
 were 
already killed, so he had to go to 
Vilnius
 or
 Kaunas
, you know, where the 
executioners were still workin
g. I doubt very mu ch wh ether he did that, but I don™t 
know, I don™t know. 
Q: But his sentiment was there. 
In other word s, he had that Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ he had that sentiment. 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

186
A: Right. But that was the only one, and I 
sup-suppose there were more than that, 
but I Œ but I Œ I Œ I would imagine that they
 wouldn™t start that type of conversation. 
Q: And yet, with the people that Œ who you
 did have start such conversations, they 
were still in some shock? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. And th -that™s why they
 brought up th e subject
, they just Œ just 
couldn™t Œ couldn™t hold, they just wa
nted to  Œ to Œ to  speak about it. 
Q: So all this happened in the first se
veral months after the German invasion? 
A: Right. 
Q: And after the German occupation, and we
 have another three years, or another 
two and a half years of Œ of Germ
an occupation, Nazi occupation of 
Lithuania
. 
Anything in those next couple of years occu
r that was also related to the Ho locaust, 
to the Jewish community, that
 you came across in your lif
e at that time, or was it 
pretty much over by
 the fall of 1941? 
A: In 
Panev
¡
žy s
 was over, because no Jews were le
ft, unless some body hid some of 
the Jews, which happened, as we found
 out later. At that time nobody w-was 
bragging about it. So
 Œ but I went to 
Vilnius
, to study in 
Vilnius
 and there were 
ghetto. 
Q: Oh yeah, there 
was a ghetto there. 
A: Ghetto there, really two of them at
 the beginning. And 
yeah, but it was so 
isolated, and was at Œ the wall, they were r
eally under the wall ther
e, s-so they were 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas  
 
October 14, 2010 
 

 
 
187
so isolated that we didn™t know what™s 
going on in  there. We knew that it Œ we saw 
some of the Jews being driven to  some ki
nd of work. We knew 
they were, some of 
them, working in the factories, one fact
ory came up in flames because it seems 
[indecipherable]
 there sabotage, because they we
re working for the German army, 
for the Œ getting the cur Œ th-the 
furs, you know, for the winter. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah, so
 Kailis
 factory. So , but we d Œ we kne
w that executions were going on in  
Paneriai
. From time to time they were taking 
out there and Œ and 
being killed. We 
knew that some of the Jews escaped. Es
caped  Œ not only those which were hidden, 

but escaped into the 
forests in vil Œ in 
Vilnius
 area and in 
Kaunas
 area, I don™t know 
in other ci-cities. And there 
joined the Soviet guerillas, 
Soviet partisans, which the 
movement, at that time, you know, th-the Œ 
the Soviet planes were parachuting some 
of leaders and weapons. And th -there was th
at moveme nt of the Soviet partisans, es-
escaped prisoners of war, Russian prisoners 
of war escaped. Some of the Lithuanian 
communists wer Œ survived, and the Jews wh
o escaped from the ghettos. Now, at 
that time th ere was Lithuanian resistance 
mo vement against the Germans, there was 

underground press going out, lett
ers, and even at that time
 I noticed one thing. That 
our press, underg round press was reporting 
wh at the ger Œ Germans were doing with 
the Jews. If they killed, you 
know, thousand or s Œ or Œ 
or Œ or Œ or so Jews in 
Kaunas
, there was a Œ a Œ a Œ a notice, a repo
rt. There were reports about Jewish

188
guerillas, the Soviet guerillas, but there 
was no judgment. And even speaking with 
the people, they didn™t, most of the pe Œ th
ey  didn™t speak about those things, but if 
there was Œ they spoke about the Jewish 
guerillas, I Œ I didn™t meet anybody who 
would condemn them. At that 
time it was clear that they we
re fighting, that was the 
only chance to fight for thei
r life. So, ba Œ what Œ what
 Œ nobody see how Œ how you 
can condemn them. They
 were on the other side, they 
were enemies. Our Lithuanian 
s-security forces, auxiliaries were fighting 
against go Œ Soviet guerillas, also against 
the Jewish Soviet guerillas, but not because
 they™re Jew, because they were fighting 
against the Soviets. Well, that was, the 
war was going on, Lithua
nians were fighting 
Polish guerillas also. But ther
e were no Œ there was not Œ 
not that, as a div Œ during 
the first occupation, where there was th
at resentment. There was no resentment. 
They  were on th e other side, they we
re like Œ like enemy, which you do not 
condemn, you know, he Œ I fight for on
e cause, he is fighting for another. 
Q: What were you studying in

A: No, no.  
Q: Did you know of the Lithuanian
 security chiefs at the time in 
Vilnius
, 
Lileikis, 
Gimzauskas
, did those names me an anything to you then ? 
A: No, but my Œ one of my friends, who studied
 together with us in my class, he was 
working in Lithuanian secur
ity under the Germans, and Œ and a-as an officer. He was 
studying and wo rking in  the city already. 
Bu t his job was in particular, against the 
Polish underground. He wa
s well Œ and he was killed 
by the Polish underground 
when  he was trying to arrest so
mebody or something like that. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So I knew him very well. 
Q: Mm-hm. And did he have anything to 
say about the wo rkings there, or was he 
pretty quiet about it? 

A: He was kind of quiet, yeah, generally he
 was a quiet man. But no-nothing Œ but as 

far as I know he had nothing to  do with th e 
Jews, but I can™t be sure. I can™t be sure, 
but really against the Poles, and still 
continued that hostility. Doesn™t matter, you 
know, because the German occupation, but 
Lithuanians were still fighting the Jew Œ 
the Jew Œ the Polish, and the Polish 
Lithuanian, fighting Lithuanians. 
Q: Yeah, the Œ

u would like to add to  
events that touched Œ 
that again, you heard of, or 
were inv Œ or were 
involved in , in a sense of Œ of being 
in a certain place when so
mething happens, about th
e Jews during the German 
occupation? 
A: About the Jews during the German occupation? 

Q: Yeah. Since you were in

¡
žy s
 and you were in 
Vilnius
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ is there any other memo ry, any other 
event or instance in those two and a half, 
three years? 
A: No, not really, excep
t that, you know, in  
Vilnius
 I-I was a student, and between 
the students and Œ an d some wa Œ in the 
higher class, were definitely condemn  Œ 
with old Œ th e opinion was condemning thos
e who had participated in executions, 
and even at that time were pa
rticipating, because more or 
less, killing of the Jews in 
Paneriai Œ Austai
(ph) 
Paneriai
 took place all the time, 
sometimes l ess, some ti mes 
more and the killers were working all the 
time. Of course, killers were killing not 
only the Jews, they were killing also the 
Poles, and well, Lithuanians, Germans 

killed themselves. But th-t
hey killed them also.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, the 
Lahavichos
(ph) Œ it was territorial defense organization, wh ich 
General

know, fell out. Germans arrested him and disa
rmed that defense force and killed, you 
know, hundreds of Œ of his soldiers. And 
th en the, you know, Lithuanians from the 
east 
Prussi a
, not from 
Klaip

dos
, but even farther, 
Tilž
¡
 and all that, they f Œ they 
were, you know, fled from Nazis to 
Lithuania
 in
 Vilnius,
 they arrested and 
executed them in 
Austai
(ph) 
Paneriai 
also. 
Q: And the reason was because of
 activities, o r because of Œ 
A: Oh, activities, they were pu-publishing
 in Lithuanian ne
wspaper, Lithuanian 
books. Well, of course, that was all over, b
ecause they had to fl
ee from the Nazis and 
they came to 
Lithuania
. And Œ but the tils Œ

as Germans occupied 
Lithuania
 into 
Vilnius
 and they came from

they just 
took them out and executed the 
whole two families there. So Œ 
Q: How Œ I s Œ I have a sense that we™re go

A: Right. 
Q: How did things end with you in 
Lithuania
? What happened w
ith your family? 
What happened in 1944 as the war was tu
rning? Bring us up to
 date as how you 
came to liv e in the 
United States. 

A: Well, I Œ I don™t know whether I should 
go thro ugh Œ through small detail, but 
after university was closed Œ the Germans closed the university. Well,
 first of all, the 
Germans, after 
Stalingrad
, which was in Œ 

 
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas

192
Q: 1943. 
A: Œ 1943, which was another turn ing point, 
I was very much aware, and most of the 
people were aware that this a turning point. After
 Stalingrad
 we thought maybe, you 
know, there might be somebody if Œ if the Germans throw the 
Hitler
 away, or 
something may Œ some Œ but mo st likely 
Germans have lost the war. So, Germans 
also realized that they are 
in bad shape now. So they  d
ecided oh, Lithuanians wanted 
to fight against the Soviets, okay, so let™s 
call Estonians, Latvia
ns and Lithuanians, 
they established 
Wa ffen SS 
legions for those countries and drafted the young men 
into those 
Waffen SS
 legion. Estonian  
[indecipherable]
 legion, and Latvian, two 
divisions. Estonian, one division, La
tvian, two divisions. And Lithuanian, 
Lithuanians just boycotted. Nobody rea
lly, excepts few invalid
s reported to the 
induction center. Well, they b
ecame so angry, they closed
 the universities, because 
they realized that the students were behind 
it, and they  arrested the Œ you know, s Œ I 
don™t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in 
Lithuania
. P-Priests, 
professors, even their administrators who 
work ed on th at dam, high ad ministrators 
and brought them to the concentration camp in 
Stutth of
, near 
Danzig.
 And all the 
other oppressions, you know, your Œ even Œ 
ev en  Œ  ev en  
farmers and so al-al-also. 
So, once that started Œ well, I d Œ I don™t wa
nt to go in to lo  Œ long details, but I Œ I 
wa Œ I became sick
 with a pneumonia
 
and was in the hospital and I was discharged 
for pneumonia. And the Germ
ans took a list of discharg
ed  people and drafted us.

And I saw that™s Œ it™s really a sad situati
on. So I thought that the only thing I have, 
if I don™t want, you know, that my family will suffer 
[in d ecipherable]
 for that, I Œ I 
would rather collec Œ select, you know, wh
ere do I am going under the Germans. 
And I selected so-called 
Reichsarbeitsdienst. 
A 
Reichs
 labor service, which all the 
Germans had to Œ to go thro ugh before going into the m
ilitary service, but also the 
girls had to go through that. So I w Œ I 
volunteered for that, not wanting to go 
anywhere else. My resistance 
leader approved of that.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: He himself was part German, and appa
rently thought that that™s Œ that™s 
advantageous to Œ to Œ to
 Œ to be on that side 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: So you were an anti-German resistance Œ 

A: I was. 

Q: Œ as an anti-Nazi resistance 
[in d ecipherable]
 
A: Right, right, yes. So my leader acce 
Œ a-approved of that, and I went into the 
arbeitsdienst. 
I served for, not the fu
ll term. I don™t know why, they let us go 
earlier. And we came to
 Lithuania
. We knew that, you 
know, the German Œ 
Q: Were you Œ excuse me, I™m sorry to interrupt. You weren™t in 
Lithuania
 at that

 in

 where the German rockets were being built, you

 and Œ and the other. And Mr. 
Bro wn
 was there, you know, I 
Œ we saw him. 
Q: You did? You saw him? 

A: Y-Yeah, well, just fleeing, you know, 
he was walking through there. So, was Œ 
was Œ German were very correct about that. 
Apparently they wanted to create some 
friendly people for th em, you know. Was Œ wa
s no-not bad at all. And th e Germans 
wo Œ took Œ but we were working together 
with the Germans, mixed together with 
the Germans, and they were young boys, bu
t friendly. So , was not a bad experien ce. 
Wa Œ one Œ bu-but then we were released 
from that service earli

 he needs some experienced

Germans, you know, came in conflict with 
Lahavichos
(ph) for many aspects. They 
di Œ didn™t hold with th eir agreements. 
Lahavichos
(ph) was a very strong, a very s-
stubborn and proud man. We loved him, all 
the soldiers loved him, he was a real 
leader. So the Germans arrested him, his st
aff, as I said, and di
sbanded this Œ th is 
unit and executed some of them. We were le
t go earlier, so I lived in my aunt™s 
house in Œ in the village. And 
then the Russians approached 
Lithuania
, pretty soon 
they took 
Vilnius,
 was a-approach ing 
Kaunas
 and I decided, you know, that I Œ I™m 
not going to  wait for them. Some who mo  Œ 
my  friends ask me to, you know, join 
them as guerrilla fighters against the Sovi
ets. I didn™t believe in that, I thought 
maybe two, three months, not more, you kn ow. I didn™t believe that the west will 
fight for 
Lithuania
. I decided I go west, and try, 
you know, to Œ to meet it, the 
western English, or Americans in 
Germany
, because this was obvious 
Germany
 
lost the war, that was clear. 
Q: Did your parents go with you? 
A: No. My  mother wanted 
to go with me, well there 
was confusion, a lot of 
confusion. And my  pa Œ father wa
nted, you know, he was too late.

 was 
taking without any Œ 
any ba-battle. Germans just de
molished electrical plant and 
retreated without any ac Œ without any 
resistance. So my 
father stayed in 
Lithuania .
 
My mother eventu
ally went to 
Germany
 also, but separately form Œ from myself. I

went to 
Germany
, also, we met at the end of war. I met my mother in
 Munich, 
and 
well, I must tell y Œ if I tell the fu
ll story, so I went to the east 
Prussi a
.  
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: We were sent to work together with 
the farmers, to Œ to help the farmers. 
Apparently, also, before the evacuation, 
it was clear that the 
Russians will go in Œ 
inside. So we were working 
at the farm, and then sudde
nly was told everybody has 
to go to dig ditches agains
t the tanks, to make obstacles to the Soviet tanks coming 
in. And a lot of Lithuanians, Poles, ever
ything, you know, were brought together, 
and who were just digging those anti-
tank ditches. Which didn™t help  any, 
apparently, later. We were in Œ in the Œ in 
the rather famous Œ we later fa Œ became 
famous in the Œ or infamous
 really. A village nomar -- 
Nemmersdorf
 Œ 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Well, yeah, what Œ Soviets e-e-executed
 a lot of Germans. All of them, really, 
who were left there, so Œ who were digging
 those Œ those anti-tank ditches. Now, one 
afternoon, you know, after Œ 
after lunch, we were Œ a br
eak, you know, were eating 
our lunch and su ddenly  we noticed that 
SS
 troopers have surrounded us all around. 

And they took out their auto
matic weapons and one of th
em came fo rward. And in 
very good Lithuanian langua
ge, very good, with no accen
t, nothing, said that we 
Lithuanians are all communists, we should be
 shot right away. We didn™t fight to 
defend our own country, and we deserve to
 die row Œ right here and now. Bu t, the

fuehrer is so great in Œ in his Œ you know, th
at he decided to let us Œ to Œ I mean, to 
w-wer Œ to fight f Œ for the 
Germany
 in this way, you know
, of our Œ our shame, 
that we didn™t defend our co
untry, that we are basically 
communists at heart, who let 
us, you know, wer Œ you know Œ well, anyway, to
 Œ to Œ to  Œ to Œ to Œ to paro le us 
from this. 
Q: Expiate Œ expiate your sin Œ 

A: Right. 
Q: Œ in other words. 
A: Expiate my sin. So, and this Œ so. we 
will be drafted now in the German army as 
auxiliaries in the 
Luftwaffe.
 And wh-who doesn™t, you 
know, doesn™t appreciate 
fuehrer™s great move, you know, well, we 
will know about that, how to handle it. 
Okay, so Œ so we became 
German  soldiers. Soldiers, 
no, auxiliaries. No rank, 
nothing like that. They  
[indecipherable] 
gave us uniforms, but without any rank 

indications, any insignia, and we were aus 
Œ auxiliaries. We were supposed to do 
work , we were digging trenches
 against the sw Œ Swedes in
 Stralsund
 in 
Germany
. 
Stralsund
 because the Germans at 
that time thought that 
Sweden™s
 will Œ going to 
join the allies and attack them
 in the north. So we were 
digging those trenches after 
that, you know, the Swedes didn™t attack, so  
they brought us as ot
her tasks. But they 
were manual tasks, and electrical work , y
ou know, something like that. I don™t know 
whether to tell the story, I Œ I Œ I Œ 
because Œ are we running out of time?

A: Yeah, well Œ well, anyways, well after th
e war, I met my Œ my 
mother. I didn™t go 
into the prisoner of war, I just deserted 
from the Germans. I didn™t feel that I owe 
them anything. And we lived in 
Germany

Tübing en,
 
studied law again. And then, 
you know, my uncle, my moth
er™s brother brought us to 
the 
United States,

Q: And your profession after the war, can you tell us?

A: Brushing Œ buffing the lips
tick casings. So th-that was work. It was di-dirty work.

have any diplomats, and Mr. 
Simutas
(ph), who was appointed ambassador at the 
United Nations, asked me 
to join his staff.
