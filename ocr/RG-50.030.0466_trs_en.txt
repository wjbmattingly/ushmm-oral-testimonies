SYLVIA GREEN 
 January 11, 1996 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is Arwen Donahue. I am he
re with Mrs. Sylvia Green, on January 11
th
, 1996 at 
her home in Wi nchester, Kentucky. This is a U.S.
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. This 
is side A, of tape number one. Okay, Mrs. Gree
n, will you please tell me  your name  as it was at 
birth and your date of birth 
and the pl ace where you were born. 
Answer: My name  i -- was Sylvia Farber. I wa
s born in Karlsruhe on Rhine, April the 14
th
, 1924.  
Q: And Karlsruhe -- 

A: Karlsruhe on Rhine -- 

Q: -- was in Germany?  

A: -- yeah, in Baden, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And will you tell me  some thing 
about your -- your parents, and ge -- let™s 
start with your father. What was his fa mily background? 

A: He was one of seven children and they were
 ma rried in 1919. They were ma rried in Poland 

and then they moved to Germany right away. And 
they lived in Stuttgart. And my brother was 
born in 1920 in Stuttgart. And I don™t know when
 they moved to Karlsruhe, I was born in 
Karlsruhe in ™24. So between ™20 and ™24 
they moved. I don™t know the exact date.  
Q: And your father™s -- your father™s fa
mily, were they mi ddle class, or -- 
A: Yeah, my -- my [indecipherable] what I have
 been told -- I didn™t 
know too ma ny of them 
except the ones who were living in Ge rmany, some
 stayed in Poland. He was the baby, and when 
my dad was born, his oldest brothe
r already had children the age of 
my father and they were in 
the United St ates. And some  of the m moved to Ka
rlsruhe, some  of the m 
-- his sister lived in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

Nuremberg, and she would come  and visit. And th
ey had a dairy store. Dairy, eggs and butter. 
And my dad, that was my dad™s job in Karlsruhe. 
It was lucky, my mother always said I was the 
lucky child because the day I was born my dad 
got that job. He was the manager of t he dairy 
departme nt in the wholesale grocery st ore. And he
 had this job until he was deported to Poland in 
1938, and on the same day my brother came home with
 a horseshoe, and that™s supposed to be 
luck also. 
Q: So your father was born where? 

A: In Dukla, in Poland. And I 
never been there, I don™t know. 

Q: And he moved to Germany in? 

A: We ll, in 1919, when they ma rried.  

Q: Did they ma rry before they had come  to Germany?  

A: 19 -- yeah, 1919. 

Q: Oh. 
A: They mar r ied in Sianów where my  mother 
was from. And I  think it was a ma tch, probably, 
arranged.  
Q: Uh-huh, I see. What -- what was your mother™s fa mily background? 

A: They were very poor. There were 10 childre
n and my grandfather had the tailor shop, 
tailoring shop. And there hardly was any food on 
the table and my mother was the second oldest 

girl, the first one was a boy. So my mother had 
to raise all the younger children, so she never had 
a childhood. She said she never played with child
ren. They had the cradle ma de out of wood and 
she would look out the wi ndow. And children bear
 on the sidewalk playing hopscotch, and she 
participat ed then, she was in the apartment upsta
irs and many times the cradle was turned upside 
down because she got so excited. But she never ha d time to really pl ay with children, raising the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

rest of the family. My grandfather, I only saw h
im once or twice in my life. To me  he was a big 
ma n with a long beard, Orthodox. And 
my mother said that he neve
r held any of the children on 
his lap. But the grandchildren he 
did. That one time we went to
 visit I was on his lap and I 
braided his beard. And my mother 
just stood there, she didn™t beli
eve that he let me  do that. 
Q: Wa s your fa mily very religious? 
A: Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orth
odox. My dad was clean-shaven and my mother 
did not wear a wig. They were modern Or
thodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all the 
holidays. When my dad worked -- we ll, the name
 was [indecipherabl e], he never had a vacation 
all hi s life because he didn™t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays. So this 

was taken off as vacation. So my mot her used to
 take us places, or also we children always -- 
every summer you had to get out of the city, like,
 otherwise you would die, it seems like it. The 
New Yorkers do that too, don™t they? 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And well, it was camps we used to go to, and 
also I was very athletic and on weekends we 
used the train. And then I also belongedto the Mizrachi, which is a Orthodox Zionist 
organization. And I think I was about five or si
x when I joined, and we had camps for about two 
weeks, and then we had conclaves. 

Q: And you ha-had one sibling, is that right? 

A: Two. My brother, who is four years older, 
and myself. My mother always said she only 

wanted two children, she raised such a large fami l y
 before that that™s al
l she wanted, and that™s 
all she had was two children. 

Q: When wa s your brother born? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
4 
 
A: June -- wa it a mi nute. June the second, because
 my son was born June the fourth. June the 
second, 1920. And he was born in Stuttgart. 
Q: We re you close with him?  

A: As children we were close in 
a way, but boys were raised entirely
 different than girls. A girl 
just had to smile and look pretty, that™s all that
 mattered. And my brother had to be educated. So 
he didn™t have a childhood. My dad wanted him to
 be a rabbi. Is that all right, the way I™m 
holding it now? 

Q: Mm. 

A: My dad wanted him to be a ra
bbi, my mother wanted him to be 
a college professor. So he was 
educated for both. So I was school -- we had sc
hool, you went to school from eight til 12, and 
you went back in the afternoon from two til four
 or from eight til one
 and three til five. 
Whenever he got out of school he had to go to 
Hebrew school, every day. So he didn™t have 
much of a childhood either, in the -- it was really in
teresting, after we met 
again after the war, he 
was ma rried and I was married, and so we talk
ed about our parents a
nd about our childhood and 
the interesting part was, the way I talked about 
our parents was not the same  way he talked about 
his parents, which were our pare
nts, you know?  So he told me, he 
said, ﬁI was so jealous of you.ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁWhy? ﬂ I said, ﬁI was 
so jealous of you, you were so bril
liant.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI had to 
be, I had to study all the time. I had no chil
dhood, and you had friends.ﬂ He didn™t have any 
friends. You always had friends, 
you always were playing or go
ing places, doing things. And it 
was really interesting. We  we re jealous of each other. 

Q: Mm. 

A: But it worked out well, I mean, we got it out 
of our system and we didn™t carry any grudges.  
Q: So do -- your parents didn™t -- 
weren™t particularly interested
 in -- in your education? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
5 
 
A: I was not a dumbbell. I didn™t have to work very hard, and I brought home  A™s and B™s 
without any sweat. And he had to bring home  
A™s, B™s were not good enough. And well, that™s 
what I said, all you had to do was smile, and you ha
d to associate with the people they approved 
of. And you couldn™t go with childr
en they didn™t appro -- especi
ally my mother. My dad was a 
hardworking ma n. 

Q: You s -- me ntioned that you had a lot of friends? 

A: Yes. I always had a lot of friends. 

Q: We re they friends from school, or from -- 

A: We ll, at the beginning I had Gentile fr iends
, but then when Hitler came to power, they got 
sparse, less and less friends. And 
that™s really interesting you™re asking that. I still remember 
Fritz Er low, we were raised t
ogether. And I loved Fritz as muc h
 as li -- I liked my brother -- 
loved my brother, Bernar d. And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. If we passed 

on the street, he wouldn™t see me . If I passed on the st
reet when it was dark -- 
at that  time used to 
go out in the evening -- at the beginning, later on 
we didn™t go out too much in the evenings, he 
would look, stare at you like no reco
gnition, but then he would take hi s ha nd and wave at you in 
the back, so he wouldn™t been seen. So -- but that
 really hurts, because in
 a way I knew that the 
reason for it, because I was a Jew, but it™s ve ry
 hard for children to accept. You -- you take it 
personally, because I would cry. I ca
me home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with, 
and they run away. Why doesn™t she like me  any mo
re?  I haven™t done anything 
to her. It -- it™s 
hard. 

Q: Mm. 

A: And they probably we nt home and talked to th
eir parents also, how ba
d they felt, you know?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

Q: Do you reme mber what was -- we re those the 
first incidents that ma de you realize that you 
were some how different than these other children? 
A: When we  were kicked out the school. 

Q: Wh en wa s that? 

A: I think it was the beginning of
 the fifth grade, because I supposed to have gone to the 
gymnasium also, like my brother did. But there were
 articles in the paper that they built in a new 
school for handicapped children in Fr ankfurt-au-M
ain, and this was a very dilapidated school. I 
mean, nowadays, it be condemned. And that™s 
the school they gave us. And that™s -- 
Q: What year would that have been? 

A: Let me just think, I was born in
 ™24, I started school in ™30, it mi
ght have been in ™35. Oh, that 
-- the da tes are getting di mmer. Th
e y really are. I mean, wha t  happened you reme mbe r , but to 
reme mber the exact dates, because I started 
at such a young age and so many things ha ppened 

until ™45. And nothing was good, really. So -- but wh
at they didn™t know, we got a much better 
education than we did in public sc hool, because
 they wouldn™t let Jewish college  professors 

teach, so we got the college professors to teach
 us . So we benefited from i t , we really did. 
Q: How far did you have to trav
el to go to school every day? 
A: It™s -- di dn™t have to travel, it was within 
walking distance. In [ind
ecipherable] of so ma ny 
miles, they had a school close by. And we weren™t bused at that time . 

Q: Wa s your fa mily afraid when Hitler came to power? 

A: Well, I saw Hitler many times. I was a nosy child. And whenever he came, I would not go 

down to see him in my neighborhood because 
everybody knew I was a Jew. I would go blocks 
and blocks out of my wa y. And -- where they di
dn™t know me . And I was standing in the front 
row, I was -- I was just fascinated by him, it 
was just like he hypnotized people. But you know, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
7 
 
usually talk with my hands [indecipherable]. That
™s all -- I™m sorry. Well, I would always be in 
the front row, ma ny blocks away from where I 
lived. And I would stay on the front row with 
everybody else, and everybody yelling, 
heil Hitler here. He always came  in a convertible, and 
naturally he would hold his hand on the belt. I can 
close my eyes and see him. Heil Hitler, heil 
Hitler, and pe ople just we nt crazy screaming, 
you know. And they all were running and I was 
right there with them. And he w
ouldn™t let them get too close, a
nd then he just would take his 
hands slowly, and everybody would go back. It 
just like you were hypnotized, you know?  So this 
was ™33. But really, ™32 already it started. There we
re Communist parties, N
azi parties, Socialist 
parties, and they always scheduled ma rches about
 the same  time  and there always -- some how 
there was a shooting going on, and 
they™re yelling and they used 
to hit each other. And my 
mother always used to grab my hand and let™s 
go upstairs, let™s go upstairs. No, I want to see 
what goes on. In ™32, you know, I 
was eight years old, I was nosy. 
Q: What did you think when you were watc
hing these -- these speeches and Hitler --  
A: I don™t know. I really don™t, I 
just was fascinated by that w
hole thing. It was just like 
everybody was hypnotized. And his speeches we re in 
-- he di dn™t say anything. He said three, 
four words and then yell, everybody yelled, he il Hitle
r, heil Hitler. I don™t know, as a child -- the 
one thing I reme mber, he™s always, when he came
 to Karlsruhe, it was a pr
etty good size town at 
that time, the size of Lovell, he would stay in 
the Hotel Germania, and every time  I passed that 
hotel, I was going to stay there some day. 

Q: So you admi red him a little bit? 

A: I don™t know. You™re kind of fascinated, unti
l, you know, then I didn™t admi re him any more. 
I mean, what came afterwards. My mother always 
said, it can™t get any worse, it can™t get any 
worse. Like when they deported my dad to Poland in ™38. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a little more about that. 
A: One night we were home , Mother wasn™t fe
eling well and she already was in bed, and the 
doorbell rang. They always were very noisy a
nd always yelling and al
ways rushing. And they 

always rushed, you know, and they were yelling, 
open that door, open that
 door, and they kicked 
the door. So my dad went to the door and they 
came  in and they said, empty your pockets. And 
my dad said, ﬁ Why?  I haven™t done anything.ﬂ He  
was at work that day, came  home  fr om work. 
Well, just empty your pockets and you do as we
 tell you, and your sooner you do it, your sooner 
you be home. And they took my dad away. Th-The
y pocket all his belongings and his favorite 
watch. I don™t reme mber  who gave him that watch, it was a gold watch. It was a pocket watch, 

that was the style at that time. 

Q: We re you there when he -- 

A: Yes, I was there, I was there.  

Q: And your mother? 
A: My mother was there and that ni ght my br
other came home from Würzburg, it was a teacher™s 
college. And we had the whistle, and I don™t reme
mber it now, that when we whistled downstairs 
we knew it was one or the other. I mean, my pare
nts knew, my mother knew. Middle in the night 
we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came 
home. Tha t  was in ™38. So after they deported 
my dad to the Polish border, they had some  kind
 of agreeme nt that if any Jew in Germany was 
not in Poland for the last 10 years, that theygonna ma ke the m staatenlos
, that you didn™t belong 
anywheres, you had no -- no country. And Ger many 
did not want to get st
uck -- your back hurts? 
It™s okay?  Germany did not want 
to get stuck with the people w
ithout a country. So that™s why 
they pushed them to the border, and the Polack
s were shooting and the Germans we re shooting 
and some how they came to an agreement. Now, I wa
s not there, this was told to me afterwards 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
9 
 
by my dad, that then they finally let them ther
e -- let them in. So then, after ™38, this was 
October, in Nove mber they had Crystal Night. 

Q: Before we talk about Crysta
l Night could you just tell me a little bit about how your mother 
and you and your brother dealt with the -- the abse
nce of your father imme diately after he was 
deported? How did you find out where he had gone, and --  

A: Do you know, I don™t reme mber ho --  

Q: -- did you expect him to come  back? 

A: No, I didn™t expect him to come  back because  
they called a meeting to all the wives of Polish 
citizens, and my mother was sick in bed. I think 
this was sometime in ™39, that was al ready after 
Crystal Night, and we were told to be at the poli
ce station that there is go
ing to be a meeting and 
we have to be there. If we not gonna be there, 
then they were gonna arrest us. So my mother was 
sick, and she sent me . So I went there and wh
en they called my mother™s name , I stood up and 
apologized that my mother couldn™t be here, 
but I™m here and I will give her the message, 
whatever the meeting is about. He
 yelled at me  to come  forward. He yelled so hard, and I was a 
child. You know, I was 15 years old, and we we
re children at 15, not 
-- not the children 15 
seemed like they™re very grown up, but we were 
not, we were children. I was shaking from head 
to toe. He gave me a pencil to sign my mother™s
 name  that we had to leave Germany by August 
™39 or we were going to be arre
sted. Well, I couldn™t hold the pe
ncil, my hand was just shaking. 
So he took his gun out and put it to my temple. 
And I really don™t reme mber whether I signed the 
name  or I put the X ma rk -- he was satisfied, so
 ma ybe I signed the name . I don™t reme mber what 
I did, he seemed to be satisfied. And we left, we
 left in August of ™39, beginning of August, and 
they followed us. September, beginning of Septem
ber, second World War started. It™s when they 
came, invaded Poland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

Q: So after your father was deported -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you -- you weren't really sure where he had gone? 

A: Yes, we knew that he -- he -- that they de
ported him to Poland and my mother had the sister 
in Kraków and we were pretty su
re that™s where he was headed.  
Q: And wha t  happened in -- in 
those months before -- before 
you left, when you weren't with 
your father?  Did you have any word, 
or what -- what did you and -- 

A: I don™t reme mber how my mo
ther found out, I couldn™t tellyou that. There was so much 
going on with me  also. Like, the Jewish welfare 
office was trying to get 
one child out of every 
Jewish family, and I was designated to go to E
ngland, they found foster home s. And -- but then 
they were going to round up the young ma n, and my
 mother made me go to the Jewish welfare 
office, and she told me to really make a scene an
d cry that I don™t want 
to go to England, I want 
to go with my mother. And evidently they bought 
it, and -- I really was 
scared, you know?  I was 
crying, I was scared, also. So then they sent my brother instead. 

Q: Wa s that what your mother wanted? 

A: That™s what my mother wanted, because they 
were not -- they were not doing anything to the 
girls, but they were already 
taking the young me n to Dachau, so she wanted him out of the 
country. 

Q: What do you reme mb er about Kristallnacht? 

A: Crystal Ni ght, it was wild. We  di dn't go out, 
and excuse me  -- got the hair right behind the 
eye. I™m looking at you -- okay. They banged at 
the door and my mother yelled, ﬁWe don™t have 
any ma n here in the house, you deported my husband.ﬂ
 And my brother hid in
 the apartment at a 
-- I think in the closet or some thing, or the 
bathroom. And we  didn™t 
open the door. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
11 
 
screamed and they screamed and then they went
 away. Several time s they came that night, and 
then later on we found out they
 burned the synagogues, they 
burned the Torahs, they took the 
rabbi and set his beard on fire. And this was afte
rwards, ab -- I didn™t go --
 we did not go out, we 
were too scared to go out. This was November ™
38. It was horrible, it re
ally -- it was horrible 
when they took my father away, but they just 
went crazy, they really did. We lived on Main 
Street and there was so much yelling going on, I st
ood behind the curtain just to see so mething. 
And then they broke all 
the glass in the Jewish stores, and th
ere were quite a few Jewish stores 
on Main Street. They we nt berserk. 
Q: Did your mother have any plans 
to leave Karlsruhe at the time ?  
A: We ll, you need an affidavit to come  to the 
United States and my Aunt
 Minna, the one that I 
came to the United States with had a brother-
in-law in Lexington, Kentucky. And after -- we 

were in Poland, we lived in the same  apartmen
t house my aunt lived in. And we talked, if 
some body was going to survive that, to get in touch with Leon Erbach, and 
there was a street, but 
I didn™t remember it when I wrote to them. And t hat
™s how we were going to be re -- reunited. So 
-- what was the question you ask? 

Q: I asked if your mother had plans to leave Karlsruhe. 

A: Yeah, yeah, Erbach sent us an affidavit, but 
it was already too late, be
cause Hitler went into 
Austria. That was in ™38, and the Austrian 
quota -- did you see a -- th
ere was a quota, German 
citizen, Polish citizen, Austrian citizen. You had to
 wait, you got the number. So they raised the 
Austrian quota for the Jews get out of Austria. So we couldn™t get out. If -- ma ybe another six 

months, we could have ma de it. Bu
t I guess it wasn™t meant to be. 
Q: And you didn™t ha ve any contact 
with your father at all until -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
12 
 
A: Until we met again -- we were reunited in Kr
aków. We  ha d to leave in ™39, August ™39, and 
we were reunited with my dad. And they rented a small apartment and -- 

Q: Let™s go back t-to a -- just
 after you had found out that yo
u were -- you and your mother -- 
you had signed a form and you knew 
that were to be leaving -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- Germany. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What -- what did you do?  How long did it ta
ke for you to be deported?  What happened? 
A: I worked in a Jewish welfare office, I wa
s like a gopher, you know, taking papers. There were 
Jewish offices in different -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
A: -- can you understand it?  I ta
lk with a very heavy accent. 
Q: Yes, yes, that™s fine. 

A: You can understand? 

Q: This is tape one, side B of
 an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. And Mrs. Green, if you 
would just repeat that from the beginning, the 
question about what you did after you had signed 
that affidavit? 

A: I worked in the Jewish welfare office, 
and -- like a gopher, you know, taking papers. They 
had offices in different parts of town, and als
o, when the switchboard operator went to lunch, I 
would take over for a very short time. That wa
s one job I hated. Wa s a nervous wreck. Always 
thought I was going to connect the wrong people.
 So, I don™t know, that™s
 just about all I 
reme mber what happened. I don™t kn
ow how else I passed the time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
13 
 
Q: How long did it take until you act
ually had to leave Germany becau
se of that paper that was 
signed?   
A: There was a -- well, we had to leave or -- 
I think they gave you a few months to get ready. 
And well, my brother, he -- we had a like an ov
erseas trunk and -- and he
 packed everything, and 
it was shipped to Poland. And the bedroom was sh
ipped to Poland. We  didn™t get it. So, we left 
by August, beginning of August you just had to leave. 

Q: We re you on a train? 

A: Yes, yes. We  stopped by -- we stopped off in 
Berlin. My brother went
 to England the same  
night my mo ther and I caught the train to Pola
nd, but we stopped off in Berlin. My mother 
wanted me  to talk to the American consulate.
 And she thought I could 
s -- do better, you know, 
to talk to -- that ma ybe we could get out and 
come to America. I didn't even get to see the 
consulate in Berlin. I just talk
ed to the secretary or some body 
at the front desk. Maybe some  
other people had the same  idea, too. 
Q: How long did the trip take? 
A: I know it was an overnight trip, but I don™t 
know exactly. It™s very hard to reme mb er 
everything, it was such a long peri
od of time. Like I told you when
 I talked over the telephone to 
you, I started right from the beginning with him.
 Look, that was ™33 until 
™45, that™s 12 years. 
That™s a long time.  

Q: Did you know where you were headed? 

A: Poland, yes. We  were headed to Kr aków. 

Q: By choice? 

A: We ll, we had to leave Germany. Yeah, by c
ho -- by cho -- choice, ex
cuse me . After we™ve 
crossed the border, it was our c
hoice to go to Kraków, because my aunt lived in Kraków. If we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
14 
 
had some body in Wa rsaw, ma ybe we would ha
ve gone to Warsaw, but we  didn™t know anybody. 
My mother was born in a little town near Kraków. 

Q: So she -- you me ntioned that she thought
 that was where your father would be. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And I don™t reme mbe r  whether 
she knew or she thought 
he would be there. 
Because my aunts -- my aunt lived in Kraków. 

Q: Wa s that your father™s sister? 

A: No, my mother™s sister. 
 
Q: Do you reme mber what happened when you arrived? 

A: Yeah. We want -- we went 
on the vacation. My Aunt Minna was in the vacation -- vacation in 
Jordanów. It was a vacation place, and we went 
there for a whole week. I even got a pi ctur e of 
that. And my dad came, or he was there als
o. And it was great, I -- 
I just thought well now, 
everything is going to go get back to norma l and si
nce they rented an apartment, that everythi ng 
is going to be okay now. We were 
together, and my brother was in England, so -- but we  were 
wrong. We  really were wrong. 

Q: Do you reme mber meeting with 
your father again, being reunited? 
A: We ll, not exactly. I don™t know
 whether -- on the picture he was in Jordanów with us, so I 
don™t know whether he was on vacation with my aunt
, or he came to Jordanów. It was not very 
far from Kraków. It was a vacation place.  

Q: Where did you live in Kraków? 

A: First we lived with my aunt. Can™t reme mber the name  of t hat street, but as soon as they 

stopped bombing Kraków, we were in the baseme
nt and the house across the street got bombed 
in mi ddle in the night. We just took sheets and du
mped stuff in there, clothes and whatever. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
15 
 
we walked all the way to Sepastiana number ni
ne. That was a place where we rent an apartment 
afterwards. I don™t reme mber the first address.  
Q: So it was the -- you and your mot her and your father -- 

A: My father, all three of us. And then, we were not the only ones, because  my aunt lived in that 

apartment, and then some other sisters came 
from the country. And at the beginning we  all 
stayed at my  aunt™s place. And the children slep
t on the floor, and the adults used the beds, and 
my mother wouldn™t let me sleep on the floor, 
she thought I was too good to
 sleep on the floor, 
and I was just dying to sleep on the floor with th
e other kids. Seems like such a silly thing to 
reme mber, you know?  But I guess it must have
 made an impression on me that time. 
Q: What did you do with your days? 

A: We ll, this was ™39, September ™39. In 1940, ju
st a few months, then we had to sweep the 
streets. We  had to wear armbands, that was 1940. 
We  had to -- even if it 
rained we had to sweep 
the streets. We had to clean barracks. We  
scrubbed the barracks on our knees. We  carried 
railroad tracks all in 1940, but we
 still lived in the apartment. We had to meet in the mornings. 
And my trouble was, I wa s very tall, I was five-e
ight. And they would line us up, the tallest in 
the mi ddle and then the shorter on
es and shorter ones and I really
 got the heavy load. And they 
were not very kind to us when we cleaned the 
barracks. I mean, they w
ould yell and scream, or 
kick, or scare us they were going to shoot us. Bu
t in the evening, after we
 went back, my mother 
always have a hot meal for us, and yeah, I can
 hear my mom s a y, ﬁIt™
s not going to get any 
worse. It™s not going to get any worse.ﬂ And all 
during the war I can hear
 her say it™s not going 
to get any worse, but it did. 

Q: So you were working with other children? 

A: With other children, y
eah. That was ™40, I was 16.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
16 
 
Q: Wa s -- did your mother and father work? 
A: No, no, they didn™t work. I don™t know whether 
they didn™t ask them t o work, I don™t know. I 
have no idea.  

Q: And did you have any sort of edu
cation, even informal during that time? 
A: No. 

Q: How -- how ma ny hours a day did 
you have to work at this point? 
A: I don™t know. From morning til 
it got dark. But that hot meal 
sure tasted good. It really did. 
Q: Did you have weekends free? 

A: I don™t reme mber. I don™t th
ink so. I don™t remember. Do you know, it came to a point you 
were well, like a zombie. You only did what 
you supposed to do, more later on, even. And you 
didn™t question it, you just did it. Wo rse thing really happened to me  was, my parents and my 

aunt always said, ﬁSylvia, if
 Ger mans are around, never speak Ge
rman. You don™t want them to 
know that you German.ﬂ So I spoke Polish, natura
lly with an accent. And there was a German -- 
we were carrying the railroad 
tracks and loading them on trucks
, so I did not know and I was 
talking German to another German Jew. He 
came up, and he said, you speak with a bade -- a 
Badensa -- Baden. It™s like th
e state of Baden, like Kentucky
, you know? Badensa accent. You 
speak exactly like I do. And he wa
s the meanest thing, he would sc
ream, he always sit on top of 
the truck and yell at us. And we never did 
anything right. And always had the gun, was gonna 
shoot. And he said, ﬁWhere you from? ﬂ  And I had to
 tell him. I said, ﬁKarlsruhe on Rhine.ﬂ I™m 

from Karlsruhe on Rhine. You come  on and you s
it on the truck and he gave me  his lunch. And 

he ma de everybody watch. I couldn™t swallow. 
I could -- I me an, my throat closed up, you 

know?  And he was yelling at me , ﬁYou eat, you eat.
ﬂ I don™t know whether he wanted me  to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
17 
 
have his lunch, or he did it out of me anness, 
or ma ybe he thought he was helping me , I don™t 
know. But I sure couldn™t swallow. It just
 got in -- got stuck in my throat.  
Q: Did you have to ma rch a long way? 
A: Ye -- oh yeah, yeah. You ma rched there, y-
you had the meeting point and you ma r c hed, and 
you ma rched home  that night. And you had to 
wear your armband. And I don™t understand, some  
people say they -- they wore a armband with a ye
llow star which said Juden there. We had the 
blue star, a white armband in Kr
aków. That™s what I reme mber. 
Q: Do you reme mber -- did you -- we re you able to 
ma ke any friends or was there just no time? 
A: We ll, we really couldn™t talk too much, b
ecause we bet -- watched so closel y. You ma de 
friends and you didn™t ma ke friends. One day you ha
d friends, the next day they were gone. I 
was fortunate that I was with my aunt constantly
, and we talked a lot, 
and specially at night, you 
know, after we got together, we talked a lo
t. But you couldn™t have friends because -- 
Q: Did you find any ways to have fun? 
A: Huh?  Fun? 
Q: Fun. 

A: Yeah. You know how I had fun?  To aggravat
e the Germans. That was our fun. We  would 
laugh so hard where we felt like crying, and they 
could not understand. And then we -- we would 
tell jokes, and we would laugh. 
Really, we didn't feel like lau
ghing, but we did laugh. And that 
just about killed them. My God, you should be 
crying there, what ar
e you laughing?  You know. 
But if they got closer to you, you really shut 
up and you didn™t look at them. You turned your 
head. 

Q: Did you ever see them hit any o -- anybody? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
18 
 
A: Oh yes, yes. I saw them hit people, I saw 
them kill people, a -- I saw them kill babies, and 
–for no reason. Really, some ti me s you wonder how
 they could live with themselves, I don™t 
know. I think a lot of them were drunk. I really do
. I did not realize that 
until I saw ﬁSchindler™s 
List.ﬂ Then I saw there, I mean, they were 
drinking. I knew Goeth. We ll, I™m getting ahead of 
myself already. But th-the y must have been dr
unk, because they were yelling, yelling, yelling, 
my God.  

Q: So you kept on working like this until -- 

A: Like that day after day, what
ever they ask me  to do, I did. A
nd then ™41 was the ghetto. We  
were notified we had to leave, so like in ﬁSchindl
er™s List,ﬂ we grabbed 
a -- a bedsheet again, we 
dumped everything in there, in
 the suitcase, and you walk. 
And like I told you on the phone, 
when I saw that ﬁSchindler™s Li
st,ﬂ I was looking for myself in 
there because it wa
s so real it -- 
to me it was a documentary, it was not just a m
ovie. I was looking for my r e latives, I was 
looking for my parents, I was l
ooking for myself. And that was 
no picnic, five, six people in a 
little apartment where you barely ha
d room even to sleep on the floor. 
Q: Wa s it just your family, or did you -- 

A: My fa mily and my relatives. And then that 
got smaller all the time. I mean, one day -- well, 
I™m getting ahead again, is -- no, we did the same  
thing there, we -- they -- we would ma rch to 
work outside the ghetto, and did the same  thing. 
We shoveled snow, we washed the streets. And 
the same  yelling. There were different faces of --
 watching us, but it seem
ed like they were all 
the same. 

Q: So you were doing the same  -- 

A: The same  thing, until ™42, we got the job, my 
a unt got the job in Kabelwerk, and we ma rched 
from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning, it™s 
-- was a cable factory. And there were different 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
19 
 
departme nts there. I had to cover cables, I was 
in charge of 10 machin
es. And my aunt, they 
ma de -- what did she do? Oh, I can™t think of that word, you plug it in. You know what I™m 
talking about, a cord you plug 
in, those -- what you call them? 
Q: [indecipherable] extension cord. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Extension cord? 

A: Yeah, some thing like that, 
but you plug it in in outlets. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Like -- what™s that called? 

Q: Plug. 

A: Plug?  Okay. We ll, she put thos
e together, my aunt. It was a different departme nt she worked 
in. And for morning we ma rched with the O.D.
 ma n, that was the Jewish police -- police and 

then we went back again. And then I think it wa
s towards end of ™42, then we were concentrated 
in Plaszów, Potkish Plaszów, the concentration 
camp. And we went to work to Kabelwerk from 
Plaszów. And I only saw my parents twice. 

Q: Be -- before will -- you tell me  a bout Plaszów, will you describe  your -- your living quarters 

to me ?  I know you -- you said you were in ve ry cramped conditions. Wa s -- was it cold, was it -- 

A: We ll, it was always cold, and I don™t know
 what I looked like. There was no mi rror, you 
know, but I looked at my  aunt and I knew what 
I looked like, a skeleton. We were always cold, 
so all we wa -- wore are prison garb, and it wa
s in the wintertime. Naturally you got cold, and 
Poland is cold. And then you had to stand appe
lle, they would count you and count you. They 
wanted to make sure that a half a person wa
sn™t missing or some thing. Someti me s it was for 
hours, just  of meanness, til they got bored with 
it. The quarters, they were barracks, and with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
20 
 
wooden slats, and you just -- th
ere were bottom one, I think 
there were like 
a bunk, like a bunk -- 
you couldn™t call it bed. 
Q: This is in -- in pl a -- 

A: In Plaszów. 

Q: Plaszów. 

A: Potkish Pl aszów. 

Q: What about in the -- what about in the ghetto? 

A: In the ghetto it was apartments. Still apartm
ents, but overcrowded. Because the ghetto, at one 
time, people lived there. Before the ghetto, 
there were homes, you know. I mean, apartments. 
Q: And you -- you -- did you ma nage to get enough 
to eat during that time that you were in the 
ghetto? 

A: Probably I did, I don™t know. We  got the meal 
in Kabelwerk. The intere
sting thing was that 
the first time -- I always ate kosher, and when I st
art working in Kabelwerk they served us meals, 
and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got. 
So that wasn™t that bad, because had lots of 
vegetables in there. I don™t reme mbe r  about 
meat now, maybe it did. And I wouldn™t eat. I came 

home and I barely dragged. My dad said, ﬁWhat™s th
e matter?ﬂ We still were in the ghetto at  that  
time. What™s a matter? I said, ﬁDad, I can™t eat th
at, they™re serving traif.ﬂ So it must have had 
meat in there also. And he said, ﬁYou have to ea
t. You have to have strength to survive this, you 
have to eat.ﬂ So the next day I ate and I coul
dn™t keep it down, I was th
rowing it all up. I came  
home  and I dragged again. I told my  dad, I said, 
ﬁI can™t keep it down.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou have to 
eat, you have to force yourself.ﬂ And the third day 
I was glad to get it. So from that on, I start 
eating traif, and was lucky enough to
 get it, you know, at that time. 
Q: We re your parents wo
rking at Kabelwerk? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
21 
 
A: No, no. Just my aunt and I, and I was promised 
that I -- if I would work in Kabelwerk that my 
aunt -- my parents would be safe in the ghett
o. But naturally it was broken promises. So the 
liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13
th
, 1943. And my father got 
killed in the hospital -- 
schpital. Wh at happened was, every so often in 
the ghetto, they were rounding up people to send 
them to concentration camps, and he -- they ro
unded him up on the street in the ghetto and he 
jumped out the window. And he fell -- he was goi
ng to run away and hide some wheres in the 
ghetto. And he fell, he broke his leg. So this wa
s a makeshift hospital and 
they had some  Jewish 
doctors who practiced -- I mean, they were doctors
 before the war. And he was in traction and -- 
his leg was in traction, wa s the last time  I saw hi
m. And he was shot in the hospital, because my 
cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, 
and he saw him laying there on the sidewalk. And 
there were pi ctur es of my mo
ther, and of me  and my brothe
r around him. But I didn™t know until 
I saw ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ that
 they gave them poison. The nurses gave them poison. I did not 
know that, and I was thankful. Did you see it?  They 
were grateful. The patie
nts were grateful to 
get it, they were even smiling. Because you 
heard them downstairs already, yelling and 
screaming. And about the time they came up they st
art shooting, and they didn™t even notice that 
they were already dead. And I don™t know what 
happened to my mother, I thought my mother 
mi ght have ended up in one of the concentration camps, but she mi ght have been shot in the 
ghetto, because they would ju
st shoot left and right. 
Q: Were you with her up until that day -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- up until the day of deportation? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
22 
 
A: No, no, no. I was in the Kabelwerk at that time
. I mean, I was working in Kabelwerk and after 
the liquidation of the ghetto, then 
they build barracks in Kabelwerk, and we were there. We  were 
not walking to Plaszów any more. We were
 concentrated where the factor y was.  
Q: That was yu -- 

A: That was til about September. This was, I 
think, May -- March ™43, until I think September 
™43. We  were concentrated in the factory where 
we worked. And that wasn™t that bad. The only 
upsetting thing I still reme mber
 is they supposed to have some body come  from Switzerland, a 
Red Cross representative come  from Switzerland.And we had to clean the barracks, and we all 

got a care package, which we had to open but not touch. So when the representative from 

Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks we
re clean and we all talked to him on the 

side, how bad it is, you know?  And he was not ve
ry sympathetic. He said, ﬁThe barracks are 
clean. Look at the ni ce care package. What are 
you complaining?  People are getting killed, there 
is a war going on, you got it good here.ﬂ So we told 
him, we said, ﬁWe ha-have to return those, 
we can™t even touch it.ﬂ The order wa s to open 
it up but not to touch it. 
And they took those care 
packages away. But it was so upsetting to us that 
he didn™t believe us, the representative from the 
Red Cross. 

Q: Before the ghetto was liq -- liquidated a
nd you left, do you reme mber the last time you saw 
your mother? 

A: The last time  mi ght have been ma ybe a mont
h before. My aunt knew the O.D. ma n, the one 
used to march us from one place to another, and 
he  had to be in the ghetto. And my aunt asked 
him whether he would take me  along. So I ma rche
d with him, and he was yelling at me  just 
because there were Germans around, you know, even going from one place to anot he r. Now you 

walk straight, you know?  And it mi ght have been a
bout a mo nth before, I went to the hospit -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
23 
 
went first and saw my mother. And 
my mother told me my dad was in the hospital. So I went to 
the hospital and I only had a very short time , I 
don™t reme mber exactly, ma
ybe a whole hour or a 
half an hour, I don™t remember that. And my dad sa
id -- he was so happy to see me , he was just 
smiling. And he had this leg in trac
tion. So he said, ﬁI want you to meet my doctor, he is such a 
nice ma n.ﬂ I said, ﬁDad, I have to go, I have to go
.ﬂ They just gave me  so much time, and I says, 
ﬁI got to go,ﬂ and we hugged, and 
I kissed him and I was walking out and the doctor just walked 
in. And my dad said, ﬁThis is my
 daughter I have told you about.ﬂ 
I was dad™s little girl, always. 
And -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
24 
 
 
Beginning of Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape two, side A of
 an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. And Mrs. Green, I™m -- I™m 
going to ask you to repeat the st
ory that you were telling about 
your vit -- your last visit with 
your father in the hospita
l in the Kraków ghetto. 
A: Ghetto -- yeah. Do you want me  t o hold it -- or 
you holding -- ah, the last 
visit, I went into the 
ghetto, an O.D. man had to go to the ghetto and 
he was a good friend of my aunts, and so my 
aunt asked him to take me along so I could s
ee my parents. And so we ma rched and he was 
yelling at me . I knew he was just doing that
, you know, for the other Germans around, the ones 
who would walk. And as we entered the ghetto, I we
nt to my mother™s place first and then she 
told me  that my father was in the hospital, and 
I went to see my dad and he was so happy to see 

me , because I always was daddy™s little gi rl. And 
we talked for awhile, and he had his leg in 
traction and he told me  what happened, how he 
broke the leg, that he jumped out the window 
because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers. And well, we talked for 

awhile, and then I said Dad, I have to go -- well,
 I called him Papa. We  called the father Papa. I 
have to go because so and so, the O.D. ma n, I can™t reme mber his name now, I have to go back 

with him. And he said, ﬁOh, I wanted you to me et
 my doctor so badly.ﬂ And I start walking out 

and the doctor walked in. And my da d smiled, ﬁThis 
is her, this is Sylvia
. I have told you so 
much about it.ﬂ And the doctor said, ﬁI™m so gl
ad to meet you, he™s ta
lking about you all the 
time.ﬂ And we exchanged pleasantries, I don™t k
now exactly what, and my dad and I, we hugged, 
and we kissed. And I walked out and I me t the O.D.
 ma n and this was the 
last time -- mi ght have 
been ma ybe a month or a few weeks before the 
liquidation of the ghetto, and I™m really happy I 
had the chance to go there to see my parents.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
25 
 
Q: And your mother?  Do you reme mber -- 
A: I -- I don™t know what happene
d to my mother. I saw in the 
paper that the Red Cross has a 
new list, they found it some where, some  -- in Ru
ssia, which they kept 
under cover for years and 
years. And I went to the Red Cross here 
in Wi nchester and she asked some  background 
information and I gave it to her, and she sai
d, ma ybe you be lucky that you can find out what 

happened to your mother and then my aunt™s hus
band and my aunt™s daughter. And they haven™t 

found out. I got the -- she couldn™t find out anyt
hing and then I also got the letter from 
Baltimore, they could not trace what happened 
to my mother. I always thought she ended up 
ma ybe in Auschwitz or Treblinka or some wheres. But after I saw ﬁSchindler™s List ,ﬂ I saw they 

were shooting like crazy. I mean, it™s not what 
your looks was, they was just shouting and 

shooting, going crazy, so I don™t know whether she wa
s shot in the ghetto, what happened to her, 
I don™t know. 

Q: Do you reme mber the last time you sa
w her, or close to the last -- 
A: That was the last time, when I saw my dad th
at was the last time, about a month or two weeks 
before the liquidation of the ghetto. The ghetto was like -- 

Q: She was there, too.  

A: Yes, yeah, I went to her place first and she 
told me  my da d was in the hospital. I wa s looking 
for him, you know, whe n I went there, I thought I 
was going to see both of them. So that was the 
last time. And that was ™43, and my mother wa
s born ™87, that would ma ke them 53 years old. 
And you know my dad never even 
had a cold?  I don™t reme mber ma
 -- he had -- he only mi ssed 
work one time  I recall. He had an abscess on hi
s chest and my brother cleaned it out and it got 
infected. My da -- my dad thought he was dyi ng, he never was sick. He didn™t know how to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
26 
 
handle it, you know?  He went to 
bed. He never was sick and he got killed, and he only was 53 
years old. Ni ce looking man. 
Q: Are you -- you had mentioned the -- the O.
D., the -- those were 
the Jewish police. 
A: Jewish policemen, kapo, O.D., Je
wish policemen. Some  of them we
re pretty mean also if they 
thought they would get a better treatme nt when 
t hey mi streated us. Some  were pretty rough. 
Q: Did you ever get beaten yourself by Germans or -- 

A: No. I got beaten one time , 25, by - -  that was 
in Plaszów, Potkish Plaszów, the concentration 
camp. It was in a barrack and it was the one w
ho was in charge of the barrack, and I got 25 
paddles. There was a bad odor in that neighbor
hood where -- where I was on the double decker 
wooden thing where were laying, and some body ha
d their period or some thing, and they put 

some  -- it wasn™t pads, it was some thing, and pus
hed it over where I was sl
eeping, and she said it 
was mi ne, it didn™t happen to be mi ne, I got 25 pa
ddles. But that, I think wa s the only time . My 
aunt always told me , don™t walk erect. Make yourself shorter, you know, that you wouldn't stand 
out. And I always knew, wherever I 
went I just  walk like that. So at
 so -- some  -- some  girls got 
raped. And I was pretty fortunate, but I wasn™t mu
ch to look at, because all those years already 
took its toll at a very young age. And I was sti
ll in the developing age, you know, when the war 
broke out. 

Q: Do you reme mber the deportations that ha
ppened before the ghetto was liquidated? 
A: No, I was not in the ghetto when it was liqui dated. So I don™t know anyt
hing, it™s just what I 
heard, that all was hearsay. And my cousin was in 
the clean-up crew and he 
saw my father there, 
and he told me  that. 

Q: You me ntioned that wa -- as you
 were working at Kabelwerk -- 

A: Kabelwerk, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
27 
 
Q: -- you were in charge of 10 machines. 
A: 10 machines, yes. 

Q: And were you supervising ot
her workers at that time ?  
A: No, no. I was in charge of all 10 machines a
nd there was another pers
on, another 10 machines 
and then in the back of you there were 10 machines
 and they had to be in
 operation at all times. 
If not, a si -- the thing was it was a very fine 
but strong thread but if 
something went wrong and 
it skipped a stitch, you had to cut that open a
nd -- and do it again. I mean, you really had to 
watch it so it™d be evenly covered. And there fo
r awhile, I just worked
 daytimes. But then, you 
worked one week 12 hours, daytime and the following week 12 hours nighttime. And they did 

this on purpose, because you never could sleep. I 
mean, there was no way to get adjusted from 
one to another. So, well, we were sent 
back to Potkish Plaszów, September ™43.  
Q: When you say sent back, you me ant -- you had been there before? 

A: Yeah. I was in Plaszów -- I was in Plaszów a
nd we walked from Plaszów to Kabelwerk, from 
Plaszów. And then they concentrated us in Kabe
lwerk for a short time , and then -- but -- but the 

time we s -- were sent back to Plaszów, we 
did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This was 
September ™43. And when I got there, well, we ha
d to work in the concentration camp. We  had to 
open graves, pull out gold teeth. And the people who 
were in charge of this place were prisoners, 
German prisoners. And they were completely out of
 control. I me an, they were murderers, they -
- they were in prison because they we re murderer
s from way before the wa r, and they let them 
out to -- to oversee us. And the guy™s name  
Ha mmond, oh wow, he was crazy. He really was 
crazy. I saw Goeth many times and as soon as 
we heard he was walking through the camp, I was 
running away, because we knew he was target s
hooting, he didn™t care what you looked like. He 
was just target shooting. He wanted to see how 
close he could shoot or how far he could shoot.

And Schindler was with him ma ny ti me s. And 
they were drinking buddies. And I really don™t 
think Schindler -- well, he save
d a lot of Jews, and like they say, who saves one life, saves the 
world. But I can guarantee you this ma n did not start 
out to save the Jews. He started out to -- to 
fill his pockets. And some how, I think towards th
e end, he found out that it™s a losing war they 
fighting. So he changed his mi nd. But thank God he 
did, because he saved a lot of Jews. But this 
was terrible, I mean in the Plaszów, whether we 
had to go outside and load railroad tracks again, 
or in -- if we worked inside, then we had to 
dig -- I mean, open the grav
es and pull out the golden 
teeth, or  we carried barracks. Th
ey were always building barracks 
and we had to -- to carry that 
stuff. And really my legs are my wea kest, my -- my health problem are my legs. You can™t work 

like dog -- like a ma n and not come  out scarred. So
 we were there until 
-- oh, I didn™t tell you 
about my cousin, Janek Kalben
stok. When we came back in September ™43, people were telling 

me  about my cousin Janek. He and a little boy 
we re walking in the concentration camp, and 
evidently Goeth was walking towards him, and my 
little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his 
mother crazy. When he was upset, he would wh
istle. He didn™t even know he did this. And 
somebody t old me that he was whistling -- whistli
ng that -- it was a Russian song, or -- or a 

French anthem, I don™t know, I wasn™t
 there. And they arrested him 
right there, in ™43. And they 
built a gallow to hang him, all night long. And the next day they brought him out to hang him. 

They ma de his father sit in the front row, 
my oncl -- Uncle Henek Kalbenstok. And the rope 
broke. So he sent some body for new rope and my  poorlittle cousin must have been just scared to 

death and he was crawling up to Go
eth™s foot and kissing his boot. A
nd they said that he was just 
hissing. Goeth took the gun out and shot him right th
ere. My uncle saw it 
and he had a complete 
stroke. Never came back from it because when I went
 up there, I went to see him in Plaszów, in 
that concentration camp where it all ha
ppened. He was just a vegetable.

Q: How old was your cousin? 
A: He was younger than I am. I really don™t kno
w exactly, ma ybe four or five years younger. 
This was in ™43, I was 19, he mi ght have
 been 15 -- 14 or 15, I don™t know exactly. 
Q: Had you known hi m?  

A: I did not know them very well, because I wa
s born and raised in Germany, and I was not in 
Poland, I think ma ybe about a couple times. My moth
er went to visit, but she didn™t take us 
children. Some how you take ch
ildren more now than you us
ed to, it seems like it. 
Q: What kept you going? 

A: We ll, this is interesting question. I don™t kno
w really what kept me  going. The only thing my 
aunt and I, we talked all the ti
me , and other people, too. Somebody hads
 -- hads to survive to tell 
the world. We did not know that the world 
knew about it. We thought everybody was just 
ignorant about it, you know, they did not know. 
And I don™t know if -- don™t ask me  whether -- 
people say you must have been very healthy. I wa
sn™t any healthier than the ones who died next 
to me , because I had typhus for two weeks, I don
™t reme mber  anything. I was so sick and we had 
to stand appelle, and they would drag me  out, 
which I did not know, and they -- they stood me  
up, holding me  up. The only thing 
I can think of is, my ti me  was not up. Some body still had 
some  purpose, and also, I don™t know, ma ybe it was 
a strong will to live, to tell the world. But 

my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United States, when I found out the world 

did know, and didn™t do a thing about it. And 
maybe it was lucky I didn™t know, because I am 
pretty sure I would have give
n up. My aunt would have given up. My aunt was just like my 
mother. We  were just constantly together. Rea
lly, by yourself you could not survive. You had to 
have some body to care for. Your back™s hurting 
now?  Okay?  You had to have some body to care 
for, and she did. The ration of bread we got, she 
want to share with me her portion. ﬁI™m really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466

not very hungry Sylvia, why don™t 
you take this?ﬂ I just couldn't 
eat it. I said, ﬁMinna, I don™t 
want it.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou just want me  to ha
ve it because you know I™m so hungry.ﬂ ﬁNo, no, no, 
honest. I just can™t eat another 
bite, I™m just not hungry.ﬂ That 
was my a unt, God bless her. 
Q: Did you have faith at the time ?  
A: I didn™t have much religion all during the wa
r, and after the war, oh God, I was bitter. I 
blamed God what happened, and why. And I still 
got a lot of whys. Thank God, I got over the 
bitterness. The bitterness doesn™t work, it eats 
you up alive. And it™s -- it 
doesn™t harm the people 
you hate. It -- I couldn™t even talk German afte
r the war, a complete blank. I blocked it out. And 
my brother told me , ﬁSylvia,ﬂ he said, ﬁthe Germ
an language is beautiful.ﬂ I said, ﬁThe German 
language?ﬂ I connected it with Hitl
er, it™s not beautiful, it™s terri
ble. And then to me et people 
who had anything to do with Germa ny or Germa n 
descent, I had to run away. And this kind ma n 
helped. He was so kind, because I just wanted to
 shut the door and that™s it, not think about it, 
and -- when I got ma rried. And even 
after, I was an atheist, I didn™
t believe in anythi ng. I really 
didn™t. And -- so after I got marri
ed, I still did not talk about it
 to anybody. It was like I was 
ashame d of i t , like some  of it was my  fault, 
you know?  And I knew it wasn™t, but some how I just 
couldn™t talk about it. And then it was a small 
town, with not ma ny Jewis h people. I already had 
one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small 
town. And -- but the doorwould not stay shut, 

when I got pregnant. And then it all came bac
k, the nightma res, and waking up screaming -- not 
waking up -- oh, excuse me  -- screaming in my dreams. Sobbing wet. Jake would wake me  up, 

and we would come  in and we sit for hours and I 
had to start talking. And this ma n sat next to 
me . I don™t know whether he listened what I said, or
 what, but his ear was there and that™s what I 
needed. So I was pretty lucky to have a wonde
rful husband. And the children are great, they 
really are. They loving, very loving. I h -- said th
at in the documentary, I 
did not want to raise 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
31 
 
them full of hatred. In fact, they didn™t know
 muc h about the Holocaust til I ma de that 
documentary. I want them to -- want to raise 
them healthy, happy and -- 
physically and me ntally. 
And they got problems, I mean everybody™s got 
problems, but the problems are not connected 
with my past, because I did set myself a goal th
at if I failed, then Hitler ha d won out, and he 
didn™t, because they™re loving childr
en, they really are bi g hearts.  
Q: Let™s go -- 
A: But well, September -- January. January ™44. Na
turally we had to line up, we had to be 
counted. And they were telling us
 we were going to a wonderful pl
ace. There™s going to be clean 
beds and plenty food. You™re gonna work har
d, but you™re gonna have it good. And my aunt 
said, ﬁWow, it sounds like paradi se,ﬂ  you know. 
And then we were cramme d into cattle wagon. 
And Kraków -- Auschwitz is not that far from 
Kraków but it tuck -- took such a long time 
because the train stopped every few feet because
 the planes were bombi ng. And before we got 
into the cattle wagon, they gave us some  bread, a
nd that was all. And there was a container with 
water, and one container for the bathroom. And 
they stopped, and gosh were we pray -- praying. 
Yeah, they jumped out the -- the -- the trains, an
d they were hiding in ditches, the German. And 
we were laughing, we really were laughing. Ther
e was a little window up in top those cattle 
wagons, the old ones. And we would get on each othe
r™s shoulder to lift them up to see so we 

could get a good laugh, cause they were so scar
ed. And we yelled, ﬁBomb us, bomb us, come  
on." You know, we didn™t care. We  really didn™t care,
 as long as they would have gotten killed. 
And then we went a little bit 
longer. To me  it seemed like we went the whole week, but we 
didn™t. But you see, a time was -- didn™t seem important at all. It was ju
st running into a day or 
night, til the cattle wagons stopped, they opened th
e doors, and they were yelling. Out, out, out, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
32 
 
out, out. Kicking and dogs, and we were runnin
g. And then we looked and we knew where we 
were, because we saw the chimneys burning. 

Q: You had heard about Auschwitz? 

A: Oh yeah. Everybody heard about Auschwitz. 
And you could smell it, the smell of huma n 
flesh. So, you know how they kept the records so 
neat, you know, they had to have orders. They 
didn't have any orders. We arrive
d without orders, they didn™t know
 what to do with us. So we 
were sitting there or  standing there, be tween the 
ovens, near the gate when they opened. And on 
the other side were the barracks. And you sat 
there for 48 hours. And they were running like 
crazy. They couldn™t get any orders, they didn™t 
know whether we end up in the -- should end up 
in the gas chamber, or at the camp. And we just
 sat. And it wa s cold, it wa s January. And finally, 

there still we re no orders, but then we  took a -- I 
guess they were afraid to 
send us to the ovens if 
the orders came  that we should not been kille
d, they couldn™t bring us
 back after they once 
gassed us, you know. So then they told us to go 
into showers, and we took the shower, naturally 
there™s never enough water. And then we walked out
 in the nude in January in Poland, shivering. 
And then we got prison garbs. And they gave me
 wooden shoes, and they ma de me  we ar those 
shoes. I couldn™t walk in thats -- in the shoes. 
It seemed like the shoes had a mi nd of their own. 
And then they put us in barracks. And about -- we
ll, we didn™t do anything. You just laid there, 
or you stood there. And we were th
ere about 12 or 14 days, too ma ny.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with
 Mrs. Sylvia Green. Did they -- did they give you 
a tattoo when you arrived at Auschwitz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
33 
 
A: No, no, in Auschwitz -- and I found that out la
ter on, that you had to work there before they 
tattooed your arm, and we didn't work there. We
 just were there 12 - 14 days, and we didn't do 
anything. One time we got black coffee, whatever 
it was, it was awful, in the morning. And we 
had to carry -- they were hea
vy kettles. And in the eveni
ng you got the water soup. So I 
reme mber that very well, it was my turn to go. 
And some  other girls also went and comi ng back 
and we were almost our barrack and those stup
id wooden shoes wouldn™t 
stay on my feet, and I 
dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there. 
Really was scared that the people gonna kill 
me , the hungry people, you know, but they didn™t. 
We  just all lay down and we licked the floor, 
whatever fell there.  

Q: Did they shave your hair? 

A: Already, partially, every so of
ten it was shaved, the hair. It wa
s already very short before we 
went in Auschwitz, and then in Auschwitz they 
shaved it again and delouse them, they sprayed 
you. And they deloused you, yes, was some  kind 
of powder they did, they -- they sprayed you 
with.  

Q: We re you still with your aunt? 

A: Yeah. We were liberated togeth
er. Let™s see, after about 12 or 
14 days in Auschwitz, we were 
shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belse
n. And when we got to -- I think it was still 
January ™44, because we were, pretty much, one
 of the first ones there. Wh en we came to 
Bergen-Belsen they had nothing but
 tents. And then there was a 
big storm one night and it was 
quiet. There was no shouting and it wa s very quiet
 in comparison to Auschwitz, ther e was so 
commotion constantly. It was very quiet and my 
aunt said, ﬁYou know, Sylvia, in comparison to 
Auschwitz, this is a vacation.ﬂ But we  didn™t kno
w that was -- there was no gas chambers, but it 
was starvation camp. They just starved you to deat
h. So there weren't that ma ny people, but then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
34 
 
we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents do
wn and they moved us to barracks. And they 
were looking for some body who spoke a lot of la
nguages, so I applied for it. I spoke German 
fluently. By that time already I s
poke Polish fluently but couldn't  
read or write it, because when 
you™re young you pick up languages. They said I spoke
 it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it, 
and I -- I knew about three words 
of French, or ma ybe five words and two words of Russian. So I 
got the job, not very long though, 
but enough that I had the foot in
 the kitchen. And so I could 
steal food so my aunt wouldn™t be hungry. So th
ere were Jewish people working in the kitchen 
and some  Russian soldiers working in the kitc
hen and there were three Fr enchme n. They were 
college students and they worked with the 
underground Gentiles and they got caught. So they 
were funny, they were so funny. The y all spoke 
German and wouldn™t let the German know that 
they spoke German. And they would sing, and th
ey would sing the French anthem. And they 
would laugh, and they made us laugh. But the Russi
an people, we had to stay away from them. 
When we stole food, we didn™t tell on each other, 
but the Russians told on us when they saw us 
stealing food. They kept to themselves pretty mu
ch. We  were afraid of
 them. So, well, I got 
typhus in Bergen-Belsen and Paul
 LaPietra, one of the Frenchme
n stole food and send it to the 
camp. So by the time  I got the food, there wasn™tthat much food left because she shared it with 
other people, but evidently it must have helped 
some . And when I got bett
er after two weeks, I 
noticed that I -- I didn™t have 
any shoes, I don™t know what happe
ned to them, my shoes. And I 
told the girl, I said, ﬁI can™t go back to work in 
the kitchen without shoes.ﬂ 
So Paul LaPietra stole 
some man™s boots and send it to th
e camp with a friend of mi ne. 
And after I went back to the 
kitchen, those three Frenchme n hoi
sted me  up on their shoulder and they were ma rching and they 
were singing la ma r -- what is that? La Marsei
lle, th-the French anthem. Oh, the German, I™ m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
35 
 
telling you, they would get so red and yell. A
nd we say, your gonna have
 a stroke, he™s gonna 
have a stroke, but no, not such luck. 
And we were liberated April the 14
th
. 
Q: Before -- 
A: ™45. It was really strange. By that time  
I wasn™t working in the kitchen any more, nobody was 
working anywheres, because there wa s no food. And they already knew that they were in bad 

shape because the guards were disappearing ther
e. And they came back. There was no place for 
them to go. We didn™t know that, they were 
surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by 
the Americans, and there was no place to run around. So they were digging ditches. And oh, they 

were angry. I™m telling you, you couldn™t even set th
e foot out. If not, you got shot. So we stayed 
pretty much indoors, and everybody was sick. No  energy, no water, no food. And then I got 

dysentery problems again. I went out one night to
 relieve myself and felt so mething cold I was 
sitting on, and I looked and it was a body, and I ju
st moved over. I mean, you got -- evidently 
you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about it, it bl ows my mi nd, you know? And I 
crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14
th
 and 15
th
 the night, or was early in the 
morning, we heard the -- heard a lot of tanks, ro
lling and rolling and ro
lling. We  didn™tknow 
what was the ma tter. And it was morning and 
some body ca me  running in, we are liberated, we 
are liberated. And they said, by the Br itish army, 
we are liberated. We ll, I crawled out there, and 
my aunt went out there, too. 
I said, ﬁWhat are you talking ab
out? ﬂ  The Ge rman commandoes, 
they were standing in front of the tanks. They 
tied them down there ev
idently, I don™t know. And 
they -- with no me dals, they stripped them of all 
the medals, but I didn™t 
see that. I still saw the 
Nazis. I said, ﬁ What you talking a
bout, here they are.ﬂ And then 
we found out we were liberated, 
and I stood up and I start singing the British anthem
, God Bless the King. I reme mber that from 
school. And oh, there was such, so much commotion going on, they were so wonderful. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
36 
 
they gave us care packages. We  didn™t know 
how to handle those care packages, we ate 
everything. And that™s why so ma ny died. On that
 starvation diet for so 
ma ny years and then you 
drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, smok
ed cigarettes, chocolate. All at one time and 
sardines. They meant we ll, I mean, they didn™t me
an any harm. But I think the ler -- that the 
world learned from that. Whatever prisoners come
 back, they kind of condition them slowly with 
food. 
Q: Let™s go back a little bit to before liber
ation, and you me ntioned that -- that you had typhus. 
And I reme mber earlier you had said that you -- 
you -- you had to go out to roll call every day 
and other people were holding you up. 

A: Yeah, I don™t -- I didn™t -- I don™t reme mber two weeks, I don™t reme mber. I don™t reme mber 

anything. They told me  -- you see, the thing about 
it is, they had to have a certain amount. They 
had the number there and that number had to sa
tisfy them. Well, they dragged me  out, and 
some body c a lled, you said, one, two, three, you 
know, you -- you called your own number, so 
some body must have called a number for me . If not 
they™d be still standing there today. I mean, 
it had to be like to say 550, it ha
d to 550. If not, they went back
 in the barracks [indecipherable] 
they counted the dead. So they told me  that th
ey dragged me  out every day and when it came -- I 
mean, that™s a lot of people, that™s you know, lined up, that probably when it came to me , they 

just held me  up. 

Q: Do you know if you were in a hospital that time?  

A: No, I was not in the hosp -- there was no hosp
ital ther e. After the war they made a hospital 
where Himmler™s palace was in Bergen-Belsen. He 
had the palace there, and they made this into 
a hospital. The ones who were so sick, they took 
them there. But by that time I was -- I wasn't  
that si ck any more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
37 
 
Q: How did you get better? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know, the grace of God, I don™t know. I told you my time wa sn™t up, I 

guess I had to have those beautiful babies. 

Q: And your aunt, was she working? 

A: In the camp, no. I stole food while I was in the k
itchen. But then, there were time s  we just laid 
there. She had typhus before I had it, even. My aunt. Everybody had typhus. It™s a dysentery, but 

to get well, it™s hard to explain with any 
antibiotics or anything, because now you hear about 
typhus, e-everybody died. It was like cholera,
 you know, long time ago people died, not ma ny 
survived. 

Q: Did you have the sense around that time  that --
 that the end of the war was comi ng close and 

that you were going to survive? 

A: No. That™d be too much thinking, I didn't have 
the energy. I think I told 
you that early in that 
interview. You did what you supposed to do and 
you did it, and hour went into hour, into day 
and night, it -- there was no difference. No, I ne
ver did, I -- the only thi
ng, like some time s we 
would sit around and be mi serable, and then 
somebody would say, you know on Shabbas, Friday 
night?  Boy, my mother set a table fit for a king. 
What did she cook?  We ll, there was fish and 
chicken soup and chicken and roast beef a
nd vegetables and dessert. And some body would pop 
up, that™s enough food, I can™t eat 
another bite. Do you know real
ly, I™m not kidding, we could 
taste that food. 
Q: Did you have other fantasies? 

A: No. Just blank. Just a zombie. And I don™t 
think I was the only one, I think everybody was 
that way. I was so conditione d fr om the time  I was nine years old, until the end of the war, that  -- 

the only thing ma ny time s you ask 
yourself why, why, why. I still 
ask myself now, why?  I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
38 
 
when my time comes, I ™ m gonna ha ve a list th
at long. And I™m -- when I get upstairs I™m gonna 
ask him, ma ybe he can -- why this, why that
, you know. But you know what™s very upsetting to 
me ?  The world didn™t learn anyt
hing by it. If the ler -- the 
world just would have learned 
some thing by it. Look that ethnic cleansing now. They
™re killing babies. So I feel like that whole 
thing was a waste. At least if people w
ould have learned by it. But they didn™t. 
Q: Do you reme mber at liberation, and you -- 
you suddenly saw -- realized that you we re 
liberated -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- and you were inspired to just sing. 

A: Yeah. Oh yeah, at the nationa
l an -- th-the British, God Save the King. I me t a British soldier 
and I still reme mbered, whoever lives gonna get 
in touch with Erbachs in Lexington, Kentucky. 
So I told him about -- I had about two years ofEnglish, and I didn™t do too well, but I still have 

the letter here. I™ve -- I wa s going to pull it out
 and show it to you. I wrote to Erbachs in 
Lexington, Kentucky, but we couldn™t ma il, I 
mean there was no ma il going between Germany 
and -- and America at that time , and I gave it to th
at British soldier I me t, and he sent this letter 
to his mother in England, and his mo ther, or his 
parents forwar ded that  --  that letter to America, 
to lex -- Erbachs, Lexington, Ke
ntucky. And at that time  Lexington, Kentucky was small. There 
were about 65,000 people. So everybody knew each ot
her, so it got there, just Leon Erbach, 
Lexington, Kentucky, United S -- U.
S.A.. So my brother was in the American army. He ga -- 
Erbach sent him an affidavit 
from England to come  to the United States in 1940, and he was 
drafted in ™41. So, he was still serving in the Am
erican army, he was with Intelligence, he spoke 
seven languages fluently. And Erbachs got in to
uch with him. And he c a me  to Bergen-Belsen 
and I think I told you that previously, when they came  running in telling me  that my brother was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
39 
 
out there, and I run out and all in a sudden I ju
st stopped. I thought my dad was there, because 
they look so much alike. So then
 he took us to Munich, he was 
stationed in Munich. My brother 
was stationed in Munich. And he sent the am
bulance after us. I think was around October ™45. 
When he came to the camp, he brought oranges, f
ood. And oh, we -- we just had a party. And my 
brother said, ﬁI just bought that
 for you and Aunt Minna.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁI can™t eat that by myself, not 
sharing it, what you talking about? ﬂ  He di
dn't understand. You know, you™re hungry together, 
you party together. So it was good fo
od, it really was. And he rent
ed an apartment in Munich. 
Q: When you saw him a nd he arrived at Berg
en-Belsen and you -- you t
hought it was your father 
-- 
A: It was scary. That™s why I -- I 
t -- I couldn™t talk. I just st
ood there like paralyzed. Even had -- 
had the moustache like my dad, at that time.  

Q: Did you have a feeling of -- of s -- of sadness, or of joy? 

A: I had no feeling, I just looked. I t -- I kne
w my dad was killed and I thought my dad was 
standing there. It wasn™t sadne
ss, I just couldn™t understand 
it, you know?  They look so much 
alike, almost like twins. And then I was ve
ry happy. You know, we just grabbed, and we hugged, 
and -- he went through hi s own hell, because he we
nt in my place to England and all during the 

war that was on his mi nd. He told me , he sai
d, ﬁI™m so happy that you are alive. I don™t know 
how I would have ma naged to -- to live, to
 know that you got killed and I™m alive.ﬂ 
Q: Had you thought about him 
much through those years? 
A: Yeah, my mother would talk. I wonder how 
Bernard is getting along, you know, but that™s -- 
we didn™t know. I hope he™s doing okay. But we kne
w at that time  he was in England, we didn™t 
know he came to America. But we felt like he wa s safe.  

Q: So you went to Munich. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
40 
 
A: We  went to Munich and he 
could have -- he was discharged about -- we  came in June, he was 
discharged about two or three months before and 
he could have come  to the United States. So he 
signed up as a civilian for another 
six months, because he wanted us
 -- he wanted for us to get 
out of Ger many. He was afraid that we 
weren™t pushy enough, probably, you know. And so he 
stayed and he took care of all the papers, and we
 got out but -- ba -- J
une, we arrived in New 
York. 

Q: Would you stay -- say you were still feeli
ng numb about everything 
that had happened?   
A: We ll, you come  to a strange country, you scar
ed. People you didn™t know -- all right, the 
Erbachs were related to my aunt, but they were 
no relations to me . No, I was -- wasn™t feeling 
numb then. I was angry. I was full of hatred. 
I think it brought -- I br
ought this up before.  
Q: I™m sorry, how long had you been in Munich? 

A: From October ™45, until June ™46. 

Q: And wha t  did you do while you were there? 
A: Go crazy, go wild. Eat, drink, bleach your 
hair blonde. Peroxide my
 hair. We  didn™t know 
whether to walk on our heads, we didn™t know whet
her to walk on our feet. I mean, all of that 
freedom, all in a sudden, listen, that™s -- that™s
 overpowering. And my br
other brought a lot of 
food home  from -- oh, what you call that?  A me ss ha
ll or some thing. Is it called me ss hall, I 
think?  Brought a lot of food, and all his friends
 brought food. I guess they felt so sorry for us, 
you know?   
Q: And you didn™t have to do any work? 

A: No. No, no, he took care of us. 
Well, the strangest thing. He got
 that apartment f-for us, and 
he just told the Germans to get out. And they
 were crying and they 
were crying, that™s our 
apartment, how we c -- we been living here. And he was not very sympa t hetic. He told them they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
41 
 
had to get out, and some  of his friends also. We  
got the apartment. So while we already lived in -
- in that apartment, they came, ringing the door
bell. We  want to move back. This is our 
apartment. So, I was so angry, I said, ﬁ What are 
you talking about?  
I like to see my parents, too. 
What did you do to them? ﬂ  I wasn™t 
-- we weren™t very sympa t hetic. 
Q: And they just left? 
A: Yeah, they left, and they came back two, 
three days later on. L
ooking back now, I™m -- I 
mean, they were -- it was theirs, you know, but look 
what they did t-to us. I mean, the one they 

killed, you couldn™t bring those b
ack, could you? And this was only 
material things. But I told 
you I was angry. It was just all bundled up, you know, 
and all in a sudden it just had to explode. 
But Munich was great, really was. 
We went to museums and we went
 to concerts, we went to the 
opera. [tape break] 

Q: So when -- when you were in Munich you -- 
you -- you were angry, but you were also having 
fun. 
A: Oh, I was having fun, and I™m not the onl
y one, I mean, everybody had fun. Some body said, 
oh y -- I used to be a blonde as a child, ki
nd of golden blonde. Oh, you got brown eyes. Blonde 
hair and brown eyes is unusual. How about bleach
ing?  So it -- they used peroxide. And I came to 
the United St ates as a blonde. And then there wa
s a museum, was kind of meeting place of the 
survivors. And once in awhile you would meet
 some  which you knew. I mean, you met people 
all the time , so you couldn™t reme mbe r  
everybody, you know?  But some times you run across 
some body a nd oh, you are here, you are here. You know
, you survived that. And we grabbed and 
we hugged, and we were wild. 
Q: You ma de new friends? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
42 
 
A: In Munich?  No, not really. I m
ean, people a -- was together. Then
 I was with my brother a lot. 
My aunt was with us constantly. You see, the 
-- my aunt was my best 
friend. There was nothing I 
couldn™t tell her, and she knew ex
actly how I felt about things. Sh
e was my best friend, she was 
my psychiatrist and I helped her. But my brothe
r was very good to us. He really took us places, 
and his Ame r ican soldiers, his friends were 
very nice. Yeah, we  did ma ke some  friends 
[indecipherable]. He came back to Munich after th
e war, and he opened a 
store they had before 
the war. And he got us some  ma terial and we 
had some raincoats made. At that time a lot of 
things were custom made, you ju
st couldn™t go in the store. Ma
ybe housedresses they would sell 
in the store, but not like you go and you can buy su
its and all that. Those things were custom 
made a long time ago.

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is tape three, side A,
 of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green. Mrs. Green you were just 
talking about your -- 
your stay in Munich. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you spent almost a year there, and -- 

A: No, not quite a year. 

Q: There -- 

A: From October until June. 

Q: October until June.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So a little over a half a year. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Yeah. And -- and during this time , did you reflect much on what had happened to you before 
in [indecipherable] 
A: No, not too much. I had a lot of living to 
do, because I didn't  live before. That™s -- everybody 
felt that way. We  ate too much, we drank too muc
h. We just felt like a -- a bird comi ng out the 

cage. It™s very overpowering, all -- all that fr
eedom. You wer e  not told what to do, you could 
walk, you could go to bed when you wanted. Had ni
ce beds and sheets. I mean, things you take 

for granted. 

Q: Did you think much a bout the future?  About what you would do? 

A: We ll, I knew that we were comi ng to the Un
ited States, this we knew, because my brother 
filled forms out all the time , you know, and then 
we had to go for examinations. And you had to 
get passports, and finally the day came  when we  
left Germany, and I think we were -- we came  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
44 
 
over on the ship Marine Perch, and -- from Bre m
erhaven. And I think we were on board about 11 
days, because they had to stop, there were some  
mi nes and they didn't tell us they had mi nes in 
the water until they deactivat ed it. They didn™t te
ll us, we probably would have been scared to 
death. But I would say there were about 800 passe
ngers, maybe with the crew also. Wa s a very 
small ship, and it was not equipped, it was not a 
luxury liner. We had one 
little room, but from 
the 800 people, there mi ght have been about 40 - 
50 who didn™t get sick, most of them got sick, 
seasick. And my aunt was seasick. They -- the 
younger people they put 
in the bunkbeds, and was 
a great, big room, and the food was served buffe
t. And that -- but my aunt, she was over 40, and 
she had, I think it was a semi -private
 room, they just gave it to he
r. After -- up to a certain age. 
And they ate at a table, they were served, and 
my  poor aunt wa s in bed all the trip. I went down 
every day to see her, and I want to bring her so
me  food, and she said, ﬁGet out of here, get out. I 
can™t look at that food.ﬂ So we had a good time, we
 entertained ourselves that -- the 45 - 50, and 
it was just amazing to us, when we got to New 
York, all in a sudden those people start pouring 
out the ship, you know, you haven™t seen them. 
How did you get on?  I didn™t see you. But so 
ma ny were sick. Then we had to wait that you 
had relatives, some body had to pick you up at the 
pier, they wouldn™t just let you 
go loose. And my  aunt and I,
 we waited and waited, and my 
cousin in New York supposed to pick me  up. I di
d not know those cousins except one cousin. He 
was in Karlsruhe, and he was just like my brothe
r. At that time fi rst c
ousins were like brothers 
and sisters, very close. And he
™s supposed to pick me  up, and he just didn™t show up, and my 
aunt and I, we were the last 
ones, and oh God, were we scared. 
I start crying, and all in a sudden 
a woman came up to me  and she said, ﬁYou™re Sy
lvia Farber, aren™t you?  From Karlsruhe?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYes.ﬂ And she said, ﬁI don™t know, do 
you reme mber Bernard We ismann? ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, 
I went to school with him.ﬂ The -- the Jewish 
school. He had a speech defect, and the children 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
45 
 
were not very kind to him, and -- children can be 
cruel. So she said, ﬁWell, I really didn™t have 
you on my list, but I looked at the 
list and I saw Sylvia Farber, a
nd I wanted to greet you. So I s-
switched with some body and I want to say welcome 
to America, and thank you for being so nice 
to my son Bernard.ﬂ A-And that kind of felt good, that people reme mbered you, you know, and 
he was such a nice boy, but the kids just didn™t gi
ve him a chance. He was very intelligent. His 
father was a doctor, I don™t know what happened to 
him, lost contact. So while we were talking, 
my cousin came  with other cousins. The other 
cousins -- but I didn™t know the other cousins, 
they were wa iting for that one cousin, he had to
 sign for us. And he came, and he looked like a 
Farber. He looked like my dad, he looked like my 
brother, and we just 
start hugging and kissing, 
you know?  It seemed like the Farber, the looks
 goes through the family. It™s amazing. 
Q: Wa s your brother with you? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: My brother didn™t come until September. You see, he signed up six more months to make 
sure to get us out. And I really loved New York, 
I wanted to stay there,
 but my brother wouldn™t 
let us. My brother said, ﬁListen, we gonna ma ke
 a  home  in Lexington, Ke
ntucky, it™s a beautiful 
little town, and that way we can be
 together, we don™t have parent
s.ﬂ And I listened to him, and I 
stayed in Lexington. Do you know where he ende
d up?  New Jersey. He got his undergraduate 
degree from University Kentucky. He got his master™s degree from Chicago, University of 

Chicago. He was working on his Ph.D. in cuk -- at
 Columbia University. And he stayed there. 
Then when he got ma rried, they mo ved to New Jersey. 

Q: This relative of yours in Lexington, 
ha -- will you describe how he was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
46 
 
A: They really were not related to me . The ve ry -- the -- the one -- Leon Erbach was my Aunt 
Minna™s brother-in-law. My Aunt Minna™s husba
nd Alec, and Leon Erbach were brothers. And I 
was related to my Aunt Minna th
rough my mother. You see, so th
ey really were not related, but 
they were wonderful. They really were wonderful. 

Q: And so your brother had b
een living with Leon Erbach? 
A: Yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: When he came in ™40, he lived with Leon Erba
ch, then he went to Lovell. And they grabbed 
him right away in ™41 for the army. So they rea
lly were wonderful people, and they treated me  
better than the daughter, the daughter said. Because
 I was older than their daughter, five and a 
half years, and I could stay out longer on a date
. And she resented that. She said, ﬁThey love you 
more than they love me .ﬂ They really were 
great people. But we  didn™t stay very long. My 
brother came in September and we rented an apar
tment, and we lived on my brother™s army pay, 
90 dollars a month. 45 dollars rent. Water bill was 
cheap, two dollars electr
ic bill. And we ma de 
it, can you imagine?  And we only had hamburger 
on Sundays. But we wanted to be independent. 
Er-Erbachs didn™t want us to leav
e, but we wanted to get starte
d. So my brother start teaching 
languages. He -- he was working on this undergra
duate degree, and he was tutoring in French 
and German. And sometimes he didn™t go to bed 
until two, three o™clock in the morning because 
he had to do his own home work. And he caught th
e flu, he couldn™t get over it and the doctor 
said, ﬁSomething has to give, you need sleep.ﬂ So 
I went to work, for 18 dollars a week, but that 
was money. 

Q: Did you speak English? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
47 
 
A: By that time a little bit. Erbachs -- you see, we came in June and I went to work, I think it was 
Christma s or right after Christma s. And they 
were nice enough to give me  a job. It was 
[indecipherable], they were Jewish people. And I th
ink they gave me  a job they felt sorry for me , 
and then I wa s a novelty. [tape break] 

Q: This was in the pape r?  

A: Yeah. That™s me , a young Sylvia Fa rber. 

Q: And you have blonde hair. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And there™s your aunt -- 

A: Do you know it -- 

Q: -- and your aunt is -- 

A: -- stayed blonde -- 

Q: -- on the left. 
A: -- in perox -- yeah, 
that™s my aunt. Ah -- 
Q: The headline says, Polish ref -- 
A: Polish refugees -- that was students. They kind
 of me ssed it up a little 
bit, they di dn™t get it 
straight. Some  of it -- 

Q: Will you read it -- the entire headline? 

A: Yeah. This was 9-27-46, and it wa s the Lexingt
on Leader, Polish refugee ex-prisoners, now at 
Henry Claire High School. We  ju -- we just sat 
through English classes, American governme nt 
classes. And then some  of the students gave up th
eir study hour to help us learn how to read. I 
thought it was very nice of them. And then also, 
when I was working, I audited some  classes at 
the University Kentucky from eight til nine in
 the morning. And Joe Wa ll™s niece, who went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
48 
 
University Kentucky, picked me  up and took me to
 work so I would be there by nine o™clock. 
And they were very ni ce, because I should -- supposed to been there 10 mi nutes to nine, but I 

talked to him and then he said that™s all right. 

Q: We re you interested -- very inte
rested in getting an education? 
A: It was not the education as much what I want
ed. I wanted to learn how to speak English. It™s 
very hard to think in German and then have to
 translate everything. It™s not easy. I mean, were 
you ever in a foreign country, where you walked 
around with a dictionary?  And my problem was 
that I always would put the buggy before the hor
se some how. Th-The sentence construction was 
very difficult. And English is a very hard la
nguage. And the spelling, my  God, there™s so ma ny 
words they sound alike. Now I wish I would have 
gone on to get an education. I really wi -- but 
the education at that time wasn™t that important. 

Q: What were you doing in your job? 

A: I started out as wrapping packages, and -- but 
at April, I just felt lik
e, you stupid. You can do 
better than that, you know?  So I start sneaking ou
t and waiting on customer
s, and the customers 
loved it. Because I was a survivor, which they 
never me t another one. And that publicity, I me an, 
everybody knew about me . So I reme mber Joe 
Wall said to me , ﬁ What are you doing on the 
floor?ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m not stupid. I can do better than 
that, just wrap packages. And well, norma lly a 
clerk couldn™t have said that. 
But then, I didn™t have the clothe
s I was supposed to wear, I was 
supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue, or gr
ay, or black. I didn™t have
 it. He told me , ﬁYou 
wear what you got.ﬂ So he really ma de -- ma de
 allowances for me . In fact, people must have 
talked about this, a Holocaust su
rvivor in another departme nt st
ore, Martin, the buyer -- I don™t 
reme mber, I don™t think she came into [indeciphe
rable]. She must have waited outdoors or 
something, she came up to me, and she said, ﬁI r
eally would like for you to work for Martin™s. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
49 
 
How much money do you get at [indecipherable]? ﬂ  
And I said, ﬁEighteen 
dollars a week.ﬂ She 
said, ﬁWe can do better than that. We  can pay you 25dollars.ﬂ So I said, ﬁLet me  think about it.ﬂ 
So I went to Joe Wa ll. I thought that was the righ
t thing to do, because he gave me the chance. 
The factories wh-where I ap-applied in Lexington
 wouldn™t hi re me because I couldn™t speak 
English fluently. Now you could sue them because
 you discrimi nated, but at that time  you didn't 
know about suing people. So I told him, I said, ﬁL
isten, they approached me  at Martin™s and they 
would pay me  25 dollars a week.ﬂ He said, ﬁWe
ll, if Martin™s can pay you 25, I can give you 
25.ﬂ I did feel guilty because the people I worked
 with, s-some  been working there 10 - 20 years 
and didn™t make more than 25 or 27 dollars. But 
I told him, I said, ﬁYou know, we need the 
money.ﬂ He said, ﬁI know.ﬂ So people in Lexi ngton were very nice and ve ry decent.  

Q: When did you meet your husband? 

A: Jake?   

A2: [indecipherable] I think you would 
wind this up, three hours is enough. 
A: -- open through his cousin. We  met his cousin
. We  lived on Macdowell Road, Chevy Chase 
area, I don™t know whether you know 
that area there. Okay. And Ma
rtha St einberg, and she said, 
ﬁI know a young ma n I would like for you to meet.ﬂ 
And I was going with that Hungarian fellow 
I was telling you I me t on the boat, from Budapest. And he proposed before we got off the boat, 

he wanted to get ma rried. But my aunt said, ﬁNo way. He is scared. He do
esn™t want to be alone 
to get into a country, not knowing anybody.ﬂ So
 we corresponded, and we talked on the 
telephone some ti me s. So I was te
lling Martha, I said, ﬁWell, I™
m dating a fellow in New York.ﬂ 
But we had the understanding that we
 could date other people also, 
since we were that far apart. 
And she said, ﬁI really would lik
eto.ﬂ And my aunt 
said, ﬁWell, you have nothing to lose.ﬂ So 
they fixed up a date. They fixed up a date, Martha
 and Jake for eight o™cl
ock a certain day. It was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
50 
 
8:20 - 8:30, quarter to nine, no Ja
ke Green. I got undressed, I put 
my slack suit back on, I was 
ma dder than a hornet. I wasn™t used to be stood 
up. Doorbell rings there, ﬁI™m Jake Green.ﬂ And 
I said -- he sa id, ﬁIf you don™t want to go out
 with me, I will understand.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat 
happened? ﬂ He said, ﬁI got lost.ﬂ We ll, where 
we lived it was like Macdowell Road, and then 
there was a circle. And the next 
road Irvin, there was a circle, a
nd he drove around in circles in 
the dark, and he went downtown to a gas station, 
and they gave him directions. And this really 
ma de sense, it™s really hard, because  ma ny ti me s we
 drive by now where I used to live, to see the 
changes in the apartment house and it™s very easy to
 get lost. It™s like a 
cul-de-sac, you know. It™s 
a -- in circle. So that™s how I me t my husba
nd. And we went out dancing, and -- I don™t know, 
the evening passed by so fast, and I ask hi
m now, I said, ﬁHow could you understand me ?  I 
couldn™t even understand myself.ﬂ He said was 
very easy. I learned a li
ttle Jewish, Yi ddish, and 
he knew a little Yiddish, and some  German, and 
some  English. We  had a ma rvelous time, and 
we both liked to dance. And we dated about a ye
ar and a half and we got ma rried January the 
16
th
, 1949, which is gonna be 47 years. Long time. 
My brother said, ﬁIt 
won™t last.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁ Why? ﬂ He had nothing against Jake, he just 
said, ﬁNobody could live with you any longer 10 
days to three weeks.ﬂ 
Q: Why did he say that? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Why did he say that? 

A: We ll, you know how brothers and 
sister -- he meant well, but he
 was so strict with me . Now, 
you wouldn™t even listen to a brothe
r, but at that time  you did. And 
I just listened to him. When I 
had a date, even before Jake, they had to come  in
side the house, they had to talk to him. He had 
to look him out -- over, whether they were good 
enough for his sister. But I wasn't  a child. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
51 
 
already was 23 -- 22 - 23 years old. But he just 
took it on hims elf like he 
was my father, like I 
told him, ﬁYou™re stricter on my like Dad would be.ﬂ But then after we got engaged and 
everything was all right, he said, ﬁOh well, it™s 
not so bad. I™m not losing a sister, I gained a 
bathroom.ﬂ You know, one bathroom in apartment,
 two bedrooms. And I had a problem a fter the 
war. I took an awful lot of baths. We  didn't have
 a shower, I just felt dirty. Three, four time s a 
day, but everything turned out all right. They we
re kind of worried about me , because all that 
time, you know, you had lice in the camps, and you 
were itching, and -- and it was terrible. And 
you were dirty all the time. And even if they 
gave you water on purpose, they would give you 
soap, but never let you wash off the  soap, they just 
turned the water off. They got their kicks that 
way, I guess. So I did have a problem, so he
 probably was happy, he gained a bathroom. 
Q: Okay, we have a tape -- a -- a photograph here
 of yourself with your family before the war. 
And will you da -- 

A: I think -- 
Q: -- just describe the people from left 
to right and say some thing about oo -- 
A: We ll, this was taken in a garden. That™s a 
botanic garden. And I reme mber when that was 
taken except my brother had this blown up and atthat time you didn™t have color picture, he -- he 

had to tint it. The pictures were
 just black and white. And I kind
 of feel bad. This was a blue 
dress, and he had to tint it green. 

Q: You [indecipherable] 

A: So I got the picture and I thanked him so muc h 
for it. I said, ﬁBernard,ﬂ I said, ﬁthe dress was 
blue.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, it wa s green.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, itwas blue.ﬂ And he kind of felt bad about it, but 

I really shouldn™t have told him that. 

Q: So this, on the left . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
52 
 
A: This is my mother. This is -- well, her name
 was Selka, which -- it™s a Polish name , and then 
she all -- and they would call he
r, Se lie. And then after she came to Germany, she c ouldn™t be 
called Selie, because it™s -- she 
would spell it C-i-l-l-y. It woul
d be silly, you know?  S -- and she 
was a big woma n, and like I told you, I was Daddy™s 
little girl. And I alwa
ys said, ﬁI look like a 
Farber. I am a Farber.ﬂ Look, I™m
 the image of my mother.  
Q: You™re almost as tall as she is. 

A: Yeah. Mother told me she grew very late 
in life. About 17. They used to call her shrimp, 
because she didn™t gr ow. Very slow, she got her pe
riod very late, then she start growing. And she 
ended up about five six, or
 five six and a half. 
Q: And you -- 

A: And this is -- I always was called Klina Sy
lvia because from all my cousins, I was the 
youngest. And I reme mb er the dress, it was 
a very pretty dress, and you call that 
[indecipherable]. I don™t know what
 do you call this in Engli -- 
Q: The -- the bodice, I believe. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The bodice.  

A: And th-tha t was all made. And this -- this is
 work because you have to pull the threads out 
and then finish it. 

Q: How old were you there? 

A: I think I was about -- in 1933, I think I was 
maybe about nine. And my mother said I was 
skinny. Being heavy was stylish, because ma ny times
 when we walked down the street and we 
would see a chubby girl passing by, sh
e™s -- we™d say, isn™t she beautiful?  Then she look at me , 
hm. I don™t -- I am not skinny.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0466  
53 
 
Q: You look thin. 
A: Huh?  Nah! 

Q: You look thin. 

A: No. I mean, I --  

Q: Very healthy. 

A: Yeah, I was healthy. I was a healthy child. Next
 to me  is my brother in his Bar Mitzvah suit. 
This was custom ma de a nd he had short pants an
d long pants, but the short pants weren™t real 
short, they come  about -- just
 up to the knees, a lit
tle above. And he™s wearing his gymnasium 
cap, and every year they would ch
ange the band different colors. And this is my handsome  dad. 
And I think this picture must have been taken 
about ™33 because in ™36 my mother went to 
Poland, and she had some modern suits. I just go 
by the style. This was in ™36, she had some  
ma de in Poland, and she brought them back in ™36, 
and they were double breasted suits, so this -- 
Q: This is a single breasted suit. 
A: This is a single breasted suit, but -- 
Q: And he™s -- 

A: -- he™s wearing a vest. 

Q: He™s wearing a vest -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and a tie, and -- 

A: But not only that, I don™t see the spats. Maybe
 he wore spats in the wint ertime. I reme mber 
his spats, and at time s he would ca
rry a cane, just for the fun of it.
 It was a style, I guess. He has 
a very kind face.  

Q: Yes.

A: Do you notice this? 
Q: Yes. 

A: Nice smile. He had black eyes, and my brothe
r inherited his black eyes. [doorbell rings]. And 
mi ne are dark, but not as dark as
 theirs. Mine -- my mother™s eyes
 got a little mi ngled in ther e in 
-- in mi ne.  

Q: Do you have any --  

A: Yeah, we smoked cigarettes also.  

Q: Do you have any closing commen
ts you™d like to ma ke today? 
A: Oh, didn™t think about that. My
 life certainly has been interes
ting. It -- I divided it up. This 
was then, and raising the childre
n I really enjoyed. I didn™t work
 outdoors, they were my whole 
life, my children. But I wanted to, I enjoyed it. 
And well, they wonderful, we love them dearly, 
they love us dearly, but they got their own lif
e, and it was a good life. 
And altogether the only 
thing, I thought, well, everybody has to go throug
h some  kind of hell. And I always thought, 
well, I went through it early in life, and the rest
 of the life be -- I got 
smooth sailing. But I guess 
it wasn™t enough, because then this came up with 
my husband™s illness. But we holding together. 
The -- certain things I would love to do, I would 
love to travel. I used to travel by myself, 
because Jake  wanted to work. And he really co
uld have gone with -- but no -- with me, but in 
that respect, he was a small town boy, and he re
ally didn™t want to. But I went to New York, I 
went to visit my brother. I went 
to Israel in ™85 by myself, and th
at™s -- was a highlight in my life 
because I always wanted to go to Israel when I 
was a me mber of the Mizrachi, I was -- at that 
time I was going to Palestine. At the time I was fi
ve or six and I was going to build it up single-
handed, I really was a Zi onist. And I always said some day, s o me day I was gonna go. In ™85 I

said well, you feel pretty good now and that some day has to be  now because you don™t know 
what™s ahead of you. And I went for two weeks.

Q: So you ha -- ha -- had an opportun
ity to travel, and a -- this -- 
A: Not a whole lot. We  woul
d go -- after my grandson was born in Chattanooga, we would go 
Chattanooga about every three to four months. A
nd we would drive. And he enjoyed that, Jake, 
he really did. But just stay over a weekend. But 
even before then I would go to New Jersey by 
myself. Now he did go with me  to the Holocaust 
reunion in ™83. I could ha
ve gone to Israel at 
that time, but he wouldn™t go with me  and I was 
afraid to go to myself. I did not know how I was 

going to react, because I was not in touch with survivors. And after we got to Wa shington in ™83, 

all the survivors -- and I just t
hought it was me  made th
e children her life, almost every survivor 
ma de the children their lives, and enjoyed taking 
care of them. So, it was 
good to -- to -- to talk 
to other survivors. Now some  of the m were very bitter and I really felt sorry for them. I  mean, I 

feel like if you™re that
 bitter, you wasting your life. I mea
n, what you got left, you should ma ke -- 
make it as comfortable for yourself, b
ecause hatred just doesn™t work.  
Q: Thank you very much.
