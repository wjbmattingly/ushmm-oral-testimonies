EMILY SCHLEISSNER 
July 31, 1995 
Question:  Will you begin by telling me your name 
and your name at the time of the war, where 
you were born and when you were born? 

Answer:  Okay.  My name is Emily Schleissner now.  My ma iden was Tausek.  I was born in 

Prague.   

Q:  When?  

A:  September 22, 1914. 

Q:  Tell me  a little bit about your family in Prague when you were a girl. 

A:  We ll, we were just simple people.  My fath
er was working and my mo
ther was at home .  And 
we didn't do anything special. 

Q:  What kind of work did your father do? 

A:  He was a company representative, a salesma n, in            . 
Q:  Did you have any brothers or sisters? 

A:  I had a sister, yes.  She was two years young
er than I.  We didn't do anything special.  We  
just went to school a
nd that was about all. 
Q:  Wa s your fa mily religious? 

A:  Not really.  We  went to the temple on high 
holy days and we belonged to a temple, but we 
were not religious. 

Q:  Wa s your school mi xed, or was it a Jewish school? 

A:  The first five years I went 
to a Jewish school.  Just for Jewish children.  It was a regular 
school, but just for Jewish children.  And then I 
had to go to the regular school from the sixth 
grade on. 

Q:  So your friends were both Jews and Christians? 

A:  Yes.  But mostly Jews. 

Q:  In Prague, do you feel like you lived in a Je
wi sh world, or was everybody pretty well mi xed?

A:  Pretty we ll mi xed.  I went to a Jewish school, 
but just through the fifth grade.  But then it was 
pretty mi xed. 
Q:  And everyone got along? 

A:  More or less, yes.  I mean 
there mi ght have been some s i ngle 
people or so.  But pretty much 
okay. 

Q:  Do you reme mber any antisemitism before the war? 

A:  Not really.  I mean you never trusted ever
ybody, but it wasn't  really
 enticing or anything.  
Maybe            felt it more because he was from a German speaking area. 
Q:  But it wa s pretty comfortable? 

A:  For me  i t  was pretty comfortable, yes. 

Q:  Now, as a girl were you involved in any 
political organizations or
 Zi onist organizations? 
A:  Once in a while I went to some  Zionist meetings or so, but not really as a rule. 

Q:  And your fa mily? 

A:  Neither. 

Q:  What were you doing at the tim
e of the beginning of the war? 
A:  I had a job with a lawyer who was ma rried 
to a Jewish woma n, so he kept me  because he 
wasn't  enticing me  and I think he needed me
 because I knew Czech and German with both 
shorthand and that was useful. 

Q:  Prior to the German occupation, did you know
 much about what was happening in Germany?  
A:  We ll we heard about it, but we didn't 
like it so we didn't want to have it too. 
Q:  We re there refugees comi ng in
 to Prague who told you things? 
A:  They were, yeah, but not too 
many that I was in contact with. 

Q:  So you were working at the time when the 
Germans ca me in.  Can you tell me  what you 
reme mber about that day and when was it? 

A:  Well we didn't feel comfortable, but sinc
e it did not affect me  personally, I was pretty 
indifferent.  We didn't like it, but since I could 
go on working and could stay in my home , we 
were pretty indifferent; let's put it this way.

Q:  Naive?  
A:  Maybe na ive, yeah.  Because, as I say, it 
was hard to believe so; it was easy enough to 

believe it. 

Q:  So when did the Germans come  i nto Prague -- what happened? 

A:  To me  personally, not too much.  The only 
thing, I was working for the lawyer and we had 
German clients.  But they behaved towards me  
okay.  They needed me  mo re or less.  I was 
working for them.  I was  typing their things beca
use the other girls in th
e office didn't know how 
to type German, so I didn't feel too much personally. 

Q:  Did the clients know that you were Jewish? 

A:  Yes, mo st of them.  The ones we were 
working with did know it and the new ones, when 
Germans came, we didn't say it.  Th
ey probably suspected it, but -- 
Q:  Okay.  But what I would like to learn more
 about is -- the Germans oc cupied Prague in 
March of 1939, right? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  What happened the day they came in?  
 What did you see?  What was going on? 
A:  They were ma rching through the streets.  Lo
ok today.  Let's put it this way, it was simpler. 
Q:  Was it fr ightening? 

A:  Maybe people were afraid.  But I wasn't  -- 
personally, I wasn't  too mu ch afraid.  I know I 
speak German and what can they do to me .  If th
ey need something fr om me they will come, but 
I think, what can they do to me ?   I was na
ive, but it was easier to think this way. 
Q:  We re they hurting people?   We re they bea
ting people?   Were they
 shooting -- anything? 
A:  They mi ght have, but I didn't know it andeven if there was some thing going on close, I 

probably looked away.  It was simple. 

Q:  And your parents too? 

A:  My parents too.  As long as they let us work. 

Q:  Now in the beginning did the Germans take 
any people away or -- you know, like they did in 
some places? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
4 
 
A:  They did, but they did not take aw
ay people that I knew or that I knew well. 
Q:  But you knew they were taking people away? 
A:  Yes.  We knew it, but what could we do?  
 Not too much.  If anything, ma ybe look away. 
Q:  Who we re they taking away?   
Wa s it a particular group of people? 
A:  I don't know whether it was a particular gr
oup.  Some one was in their way or someone 
wanted his work, or so, they f
ound an excuse to take him awa y. 

Q:  So it wasn't  rounding up the Intelligencia or  some thing like that? 

A:  Not really like this, no.  Not in Prague, at least. 

Q:  So after the Germans came in, did they esta
blish a number of rules for the Jewish people? 
A:  They mi ght have, but they didn't touch me  t
oo much.  So I didn't care too much.  No, they'r e 
not against me  too muc h.  The rules were not applying to me . 

Q:  Do you reme mber what 
some of the 
rules were? 
A:  Not really by now. 

Q:  Did you have to wear a Jewish star? 

A:  Yes.  I wore it in the office and wh
en we had no Jewish clients it was covered. 
Q:  Wa s your father able
 to continue his work? 
A:  Yes.  He was working on -- he wa s a salesman and getting commissions, so it wasn't  so 

terrible. 

Q:  And your sister? 

A:  My sister went to Israel.  

Q:  We re Jewish people allowed to con
tinue studying and in 
busi n ess as a r u l e? 
A:  Not at the university.  In business, more 
or less.  Because it wasn't  public so much. 
Q:  What about -- 

A:  I couldn't continue my studi
es at the university, of course. 

Q:  What about continuing to 
temple, that sort of thing. 
A:  Yeah, we could, more or less.  It wasn't  so open. 

Q:  So they didn't close anything down. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344

A:  Not that I know of.  In some  places it mi ght ha ve.  But not where we went. 
Q:  One more question about when they were 
starting to send the people away.  Did you know 
where they were going, or what was the rumor? 

A:  The rumor was that it's a concentration camp,
 but we wouldn't want to believe it.  I mean, it 

was unpleasant to believe it, so we 
just took it -- "what can we do?" 
Q:  Now, did they ever estab
lish in Prague sort of a group of
 Jewish leaders who would help 
maintain order or anyt hing like that? 

A:  They did, but I didn't know them.  As I say, 
I was working for a lawyer who was ma rried to a 
Jewish woman, but it didn't  con
cern him that he is employing me . 
Q:  So what you're telling me  is that for 
you personally, life didn't ch
ange too terribly much? 
A:  No.  For me  personally not. 

Q:  Were a lot of people trying to 
get out of Prague at that time?  
A:  I don't know about a lot, but the ones w
ho had some body who could help them tried and 
went.  But I didn't have anywhere 
to go, so I didn't  even try.   
Q:  We re people going to Israel? 

A:  People were going to Israel, but
 I didn't want to go to Israel.  
I said "I am not Zionist and I 
don't want to take place of people who belong ther
e".  It was funny, but th
at was my etiquette 
Q:  So when did everything change for you from this norma l life? 

A:  I think when they sent me to the camp. 

Q:  When was that? 

A:  It was in '49.  It was pret
ty early after they came  about, I 
would say about eight months after 
they came in.  But they se nt me  to Theresie
nstadt and I didn't belie
ve that 's terr ible. 
Q:  Okay.  Let me  just backtrack a little.  Now 
I have a note -- I don't know if this is correct -- 
that you went to Theresienstadt  in December of 1941.  Does that sound about right? 

A:  Yeah, yeah.  Also it's a begi
nning of Theresienstadt, almo st. 

Q:  And how did this deportation come  about?  Do you remember what happened that day? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
6 
 
A:  They told me  be there at 8:00 in the morn
ing on this and this day at the place where they 
assembled us and they registered us and they
 took God knows what ki
nd of -- take as they 
wanted from us and they sent us
 in the train, and that was it. 
Q:  We re you with your parents? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  Did they tell you where you were going? 

A:  We ll, we heard us go to Theresienstadt and 
since it was in Bohe mi a, we were not so scared. 

Q:  Did you take things with you?   
Did they give you any instructions? 
A:  We ll we could take 50 kilo, including our 
bed spread and these things.  We  took what we 
could. 

Q:  What did you take? 

A:  My clothes and -- mostly clothes.  Maybe 
some  food, but not too much because it was heavy 
and spoiled. 

Q:  Do you reme mber -- I guess at this point you're
 talking about the German authorities or the 
Nazi's  who were taking 
care of this process?  
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  We re they polite to you? 

A:  I didn't have too much to do with them.  They 
sent me  an invitation to be at that time at this 
place, and that was about all.  I we
nt.  I didn't try to escape.  I di
dn't try to get out.  From today's 
point of view, it was the correct thing.  But 
at that time  we didn't know what was going on 
anyway. 

Q:  Did you and your parents talk about it, do you reme mber? 

A:  No.  We just took it as it 
came .  We were simple people. 
Q:  What was the train ride like? 

A:  Regular.  At my time  we still went in 
regular, personal wagons.  Not in cattle wagons. 
Q:  So it all must have seemed some what norma l. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344

A:  To me , I never complained.  I did what I was 
told and that was it.  It was simple.  When I 
came there, there was some body who I knew, and he
 said "do you want to work?" and I said 
"what else would I do?" and he said "they ar
e looking for some body in this office".  It was on 
top.  And that saved my life, more or less. 

Q:  Okay, we'll get to that.  When you arrive
d at Theresienstadt it was about how far from 
Prague?  

A:  Not too far.  It was 
three hours train ride about. 
Q:  What were your first impre
ssions when you got off the train? 
A:  I didn't think.  I just took things as they came. 

Q:  What did it look like though? 

A:  Well when I came off the train there was nothi ng there, and when I came there, there were 

those places, or how you would call it, and they sa
id "you go into this category, and you go into 
that one", and I was lucky.  They
 told me  you are assigned to this
 room and it happened to be a 
small house, and in my room, we we re seven peop
le.  Sleeping on three or
 four ma ttresses from 
next to the other.  And that was 
it.  I didn't think too much.  I just took things as they came.  It 's  
silly fr om today's point of view.  But I did it. 

Q:  I'm just trying to get as much detail as possi
ble.  So you were sent 
to this room.  Were you 
registered first?   Wa s there some  process, or were you just -- 

A:  We  were registered before
 we went onto the train.  You k
now, so they had all our data 
already. 

Q:  And you were allowed to keep yo
ur regular clothes and wear them.  
A:  Yes.  At that time still, yes. 

Q:  So did you share this house w
ith your parents and other people? 
A:  Well my  father had to go to the men's thing. 
 The me n's quarters.  But that was in the big 
what-do-you-call-it -- and I went 
to the small place, to the sma
ll house.  We were just seven 
people in a small room which was an advantage. 
 We had three ma ttresses 
and we slept one next 
to the ot her, and the three mattresses filled the whole side of the room. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344

Q:  And you were with your mother? 
A:  I was with my mother, yes.  Because I 
knew some body and that some body said "where's your 
mother? "   I said "over here".  
He said "you take her with you." 
Q:  Now did you have your own ba
throoms?   What was it like? 
A:  It wasn't  that          . 
 It was in this way             .  You know, and for -- and there were 
bathrooms there in the whole place for everybody, 
these showers, and you could take  a bath 

every day under the shower, which was an advantage.  We  could keep clean. 

Q:  What about food? 

A:  You had to go and -- at meal time we had to
 go with our small plate 
or shistle (ph) and get 
whatever they gave us.  It was 
mostly soup and a little some thing extra.  We survived on it.  Let's 
put it this wa y.  If some body had some body who work
ed in the kitchen, they stole.  They got 
some .  My mother worked in the kitchen.  She di
dn't steal too much, but we had some thing extra. 
Q:  In terms of food, were people allowed 
to get packages from outside the ghetto? 
A:  Yes, yes. 

Q:  Did people have gardens? 

A:  Yes, they were allowed to get packages.  
Not too ma ny.  I think once every month or so, or 
two months.  Brown package.  And most of them 
were opened and half of the things were stolen 

probably, but we could get packages.  Of cour
se, I didn't have anybody to send me  packages. 
Q:  Did you all have gardens, or you just 
had to rely on what the kitchen gave you? 
A:  What the kitchen gave us.  I mean, some body 
worked in gardens, so they stole and got some  
more.  At one time I did.   

Q:  But you had enough or 
you were hungry, or what? 
A:  I, personally, was not hungry.  Because, as I sa
y, my mother worked in the kitchen and then I 
was ma rried to the chief physician, a
nd he had extra.   He got extr
a assigned so that he wouldn't 
steal, or people ar
ound him wouldn't steal. 
Q:  Tell me a little bit about what the daily life wa
s like.  Were there roll calls, were there things 
like that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
9 
 
A:  Not really where I worked.  I just got up in
 the morning and had to get ready and get to my 
offi ce. 
Q:  And what was the work 
that you did in the office? 
A:  Regular office work. 

Q:  What was the purpose of it. 

A:  I'd write reports that  were submitted to th
e Germans and reports that  were submitted to the 
other Jewish agencies. 

Q:  What kind of reports? 

A:  I couldn't tell exactly.  What we have done
, what was supposed to be done, and things like 
that, but I don't dream about any more wh
at those reports really were about. 
Q:  Wa s some body basically directing or writing 
these reports and then you would process them 
and you would type them?  

A:  I would type them.  They were dictated to me . 

Q:  Was it a large office? 

A:  We ll, that depends on what you compare 
it with, but it was a regular office, yes. 
Q:  About how ma ny pe
ople worked with you? 
A:  About ten. 

Q:  And who was your supe
rvisor or your director. 

A:  You ask me  some thi ng different.  I don't know any more
.  I mean, I know his name.  He was          
.  But he was assigned to be the leader of
 one departme nt and I worked under him. 
Q:  He was Jewish? 

A:  Yeah, yeah. 

Q:  So you were all preparing reports 
about the admi nistration of the camp? 
A:  Yeah.  To the admi nistration. 

Q:  Now wa s this a pretty good job? 

A:  Considering from today, it was the best I 
could have gotten because I was more or less 
protected.  They wouldn't send me  
away because they needed me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
10 
 
Q:  Did you have access to any special information by working in there? 
A:  Once in a while ma ybe they brought some th
ing.  But I couldn't use it anyway, so I wouldn't 
say I had a special possibilities or special things. 

Q:  But did you just have more information ma ybe than the average person? 

A:  Oh yes.  Definitely.  But if I could use 
it some how -- from today's 
point of view, I wouldn't 
be able to say. 

Q:  Do you reme mber what kind of infor mation?  You worked in there a long time, so that's  why 

I'm wondering. 

A:  Whatever the Germans wanted us to know or
 to do, we got it first.  I can't  reme mber any 
more what infor mation was       .  The only 
thing I know since I was wo
rking there, I was some  
how protected.  Not to be sent away.  And sin
ce I was ma rried at that time, my parents were 

protected by me , so they woul
dn't be by the terrorists.   

Q:  They didn't  divide families on the deportations too much? 

Q:  The Jews were mostly putting the transpor
ts together, so, you know, this way they did not 
divide families unless some body did some thing th
at wasn't  supposed to be  done.  Steal or 
some thing.  You know, that they found out. 

Q:  We ll you bring up some thing interesting, which 
is the internal admi ni
stration of the ghetto.  
Who ran the ghetto and how organized was it? 

A:               .  First it was just the Czec
h Jews.  And then came the Germans, so the top me n were 
from Ger ma ny.  But otherwise -- 

Q:  So you'r e  saying that the 
camp was run really by the Jews? 

A:  Yeah, but it was pretty well organized.  I mean, the Germans would talk to it if they didn't 

like some thing and give some  general orders, but 
to do it, to comply, it was a Jewish business. 
Q:  And were the Germans around a lot in the camp? 

A:  They had their quarters which we re insi
de the camp.  But  if some body saw a German, he 
tried to go around them as far as possible. 

Q:  They weren't too threatening though? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
11 
 
A:  Not really.  Maybe some one did some thing or  some  of the fellows felt bad, he mi ght have 
hurt the Jew when he saw hi m and the Jew did no
t get out of the way quickly enough, or so, he 
mi ght have hit him, or some thing.  But not in our camp.  Le t's put it this way. 

Q:  So when we'r e talking about this Jewish 
admi nistration, what were 
they in charge of?   
A:  We ll, what an admi nistration would do.  You know
, give jobs, or say this and that has to be 
done, or complied with the Germans order that hasto be done, but mostly it was the orders from 

the Germans that we got, or that they got to comply. 

Q:  You said they were also 
responsible for the transports? 
A:  Yes and no.  An order came from the German
s, for instance, on this and this date, one 
thousand Jews have to be going east.  We  didn't 
know where east was, or we didn't want to know 
where east was.  Everybody was afraid that it's 
worse than from where we are comi ng.  And a 
thousand Jews had to go.  No ma tter what.  And th
ey sent them and we were afraid it's worse -- 
in Terezin we heard some  rumors where they 
are going to, but it was so terrible that nobody 

wanted to believe it.  Nobody would have 
believed that there were gas chambers. 
Q:  Who ha d to ma ke that list of the thousand people. 

A:  We ll the Jews really.  But they were inst
ructions, for instance, ev
erybody over 55 years, or 
under 25, or everybody who has done this work, or th
at work has to go.  And it was always bad 
feelings about it.  Among the Jews too, becau
se everybody thought "if it wasn't  for him, I 
wouldn't have to go" or things like 
that.  It was a very sad business. 
Q:  Did that come  through your office? 

A:  Some times, yeah. 

Q:  The orders? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  I understand that within Terezin there was a 
whole court system and ev
erything, is that true? 
A:  If you want to call it that, 
yes.  If some one did some thing we had a court and he wa s set 
before the court, and was ma ybe sentenced to sp
end a few days some whe r e locked up, or so, but 
I don't know too much a bout that.

Q:  What I'm trying to understand is
 that it sounds like there was th
is semblance of a whole city -
- all the regular functions
 and activities of a city
 there.  Is that -- 
A:  We ll, as much as the Jews could do it, yes. 
 But we were supervised by the Germans and if 
the Germans didn't like something it couldn't be done. 
Q:  Wa s this ghetto or camp enclosed? 

A:  Yes.  You couldn't get out.  You can flee 
somehow.  Hide and go some where but if they 
caught us, and where to go? 

Q:  Did people escape? 

A:  A few might have, but it wasn't  ma de public. 

Q:  Could you move around pretty much within the ghetto? 

A:  Yes.  After it was closed, yes.  Before, not. 
 We had to have passes to get from one building 
to the ot her or things like that
.  But after it was closed, yes. 
Q:  How soon after the beginning was it enclosed, do you remember? 

A:  I would say about a year, a year and a ha
lf.  As long as they got the non-Jews out. 
Q:  So in the beginning ther
e were non-Jews living there? 
A:  We ll, they couldn't move ev
eryone.  And those people didn't want to go because they were 
living in their houses, you know, that
 they owned and they didn't want to leave it.  So in the 
beginning there were non-Jews there. 

Q:  And then eventually they moved away. 

A:  Yeah, they moved them out. 

Q:  So I'm tr ying to get a pictur e of this because  this is di fferent than ma ny other pl aces.  

Basically, you moved in 
and took over a city? 
A:  Yes.  After a while, not 
at the beginning, but little by little
, and about a year after it was 
started we had the city. 

Q:  So all kinds of buildings
 that are in a normal city? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
13 
 
A:  Not buildings, these were big casernan (ph.),
 if you know what I mean.  So there we re some  
houses and people who were luc
ky got assigned to 
live in a house after 
they evacuated the 
civilians.  But that was a big advantage, 
and they lived in the upstairs without -- 
Q:  Do you reme mber some  of the leaders of the ghetto 
A:  I knew them all.  I was working with them.   

Q:  Well -- the first one was -- 

A:  Edelstein and           , and then came  the Germans.  Epstein was the name  of the German Jew 
who took them over.  I mean from Germany. 
 I n the beginning, we were just from 
Czechoslovakia or from Bohe mi a and Moravia, but
 then they came, the ones from Germany, and 

they were assigned the top job, for instance.  
After the Germans came , the top leader was a 
German. 

Q:  What kind of leaders were
 they; were they good me n? 
A:  Yes.  When they could help they would he
lp.  Otherwise they would have to do what they 
were told by the Germans. 

Q:  In general, did you and the othe
r people living there respect them? 
A:  We did not disrespect them.  We  took th
em for granted.  Maybe somebody did respect them, 
you know, one of them or the other. 

Q:  But there must have been a big difference between the way one would run the camp and 

another one would; there must have been a di
fference between Edelstei
n and Mermelstein (ph.)? 
A:  Yeah, but they did not really have to run 
it by themselves.  They had to run it together.  
Mermelstein we didn't like, but not because he was bad but because personally. 

Q:  Why, what do you mean?  

A:  I don't know.  He wa s a funny fellow, let's put 
it this way.  I couldn't say why.  I, personally, 
didn't like him.  That's for sure. 

Q:  Were they corrupt? 

A:  I don't think so.  They couldn't have been 
too much corrupt if they accepted from some body 
something sometimes, it's possible, but ther
e wasn't  too much to be corrupted by.

Q:  Did you have any contact from the outside
 world?   Did you have radios or letters? 
A: I think some body had radios.  Some  people 
who smuggled them in somehow or had some 
relatives who smuggled them in for them and 
-- I didn't have any personally.  Not a radio, 
nothing. 
Q:  So you didn't know too much about what was going on with the war. 

A:  We ll, we heard some thing, of course.  Y
ou know, rumors were always comi ng and they had 
deliveries and the delivery me n would tell us. 
 Not me  personally, but if you tell one, everybody 
else almost knew. 

Q:  So what were you earning? 

A: What? 

Q:  What were you earning. 

A:  Not too much.  Just live and know how to live and get by. 

Q:  You me ntioned your work.  We re
 there a lot of other 
type of jobs?   Your mother worked in 
the kitchen, what about your dad? 

A:  My dad.  It was the funniest thing what he could ha
ve done.  They sent him to the             
sewing ma c hines.  Before he came to the camp he never saw a sewing machine in his life.  But 

he could and they told him he should do so.  I still 
can't  believe that he was working on that.  It's  
beyond the point. 

Q:  Was there a lot of industry, I mea
n, was there all kinds of different work? 
A:  It wasn't  all kinds of different work, but 
they came -- some of the Germans wanted to have 
some thing done for hims elf ma ybe e v
en.  So he supplied the means. 

Q:  Wa s the ghetto ma king things for the war e
ffort or was it basically
 trying to keep itself 
going?  

A:  We ll, whenever they had some thing they le
t us do some t hing for the war effort, but I don't 
reme mber right now what 
it would have been.   

Q:  Wa s the ghetto self-supporting? 

A:  More or less, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
15 
 
Q:  So you me ntioned a few times your husband
.  How did this come  about and who was it? 
A:  He was a chief physician and I met him and 
we liked each other and he had a room for 
himself, so it was much more comfortabl e to live 
together and then, officially, I had my bed three 
rooms away from hi m, but we lived together.   

Q:  And?  

A:  Nobody objected.  There wasn't  anybody to report it to. 

Q:  Did most people have this kind of freedom?  

A:  Most couldn't have because there were not so
 ma ny rooms available.  But if they could, yes. 

Q:  What was his name , this chief physician. 

A:  Monk (ph).  Dr. Erich Monk (ph). 

Q:  And you me t him early on? 

A:  Yes.  I was working and I had to work dur
ing the night and he was 
working too, so we me t 
this way.  So when I had a chance to go and sleep some whe r e, I had a boss who had a room with 

him together and when my boss was working I could sleep in my boss' be d.   

Q:  Now, you said you got ma rried there.  Wa s there some  sort of official ceremony?  

A:  Yeah, there was.  They were wise enough there 
that they performe d.  It wasn't  ma rried to the 
outside, but it was ma
rried in the camp. 
Q:  I'm going to ask you ma ybe a strange question, but I -- 

A:  Whatever you want to ask. 

Q:  I'm curious.  When people like you got ma
rried in a camp or in a ghetto, would you -- I guess 
you were in love -- but did you do it thinking th
at you would have some  fut ure together? 
A:  We  figured that much.  The only thing is th
at they sent him away and I wanted to go with 
him, but he knew more than I.  He was going to 
go not to come  back.  And he didn't want, as he 
said, three people on his conscience because my 
parents woul d have had to go with me.  His 
mother had to go too when he was sent. 

Q:  He was sent later on? 

A:  What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
16 
 
Q:  When was he sent? 
A:  It was at the end when the people still could go -- be sent to Poland. 

Q:  So you got ma rried and though, well you'll get through this and -- 

A:  We ll, we'd be together, but he didn't  survive. 

Q:  Tell me  a little bit about him.  He
 had a very important position there? 

A:  He was a leading physician; he was the 
chief physician.  But ask what you want to know. 

Q:  Wa s there a big me dical operation there? 

A:  Yes.  It was pretty big.  There wa s a hospi
tal.  There was a hospital there before and they 
turned it over to the Jews.  So 
at the regular hospital we had g
ood physicians.  Better than on the 
outside. 

Q:  A lot of them? 

A:  Enough, yes.  Some  of them were sent away 
or some  attorney was sent away and they went 
with them, but we had -- considering what were, 
and where we were, we had lots of physicians. 
Q:  What about me dical supplies and equipment? 

A:  The Germans wanted -- were afraid if something breaks out in the camp, it will go outside 

and they will be affected.  So they supplied us 
this equipment and these supplies.  Medicines and 
things like that.  Because  of that.  Not because  th
ey liked the Jews.  They liked to help the Je ws, 

but they were afraid for themselves. 

Q:  Was there a lot of
 illness at the camp? 
A:  Comparatively not.  Because 
the Jews took care of themselves.  But there was, of course, you 
know, enough. 

Q:  Was there disease? 
 Did people die there? 
A:  Oh yes.  We had a cemetery even.  Because they had to put the Je ws some where and they 

didn't want them outside. 

Q:  No crematorium?  

A:  There was one, but I don't think it was used too much.   

Q:  So people had a proper 
burial there, or a ma ss grave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
17 
 
A:  Whatever they could find.  The family ma
de s o me  arrangeme nts.  It was a ma ss grave 
some ti me s.  They found a place where to bury them or so.   
Q:  I understand that there were a 
lot of different specia
lists in the me dical community.  Did they 
take all kinds of operations? 

A:  Operations -- no, they put the Jews -- the Jewi
sh doctors were there, so there were all kinds 
of specialties.  And if they could ma ke an ope
ration, if the doctor w
ould think it would be good 
and he could learn some thing from it too on top 
of it, he would do an operation.  We  got the 
supplies.  The Germans gave us supplies because  they didn't want an epidemic.  They were 

afraid for themselves, mostly.  Not for th
e Jews.  But, you know, how can you confine an 
epidemic in a small place? 

Q:  Did the Germans get treate
d by these Jewish doctors also? 
A:  Not as a rule, but some  of 
them preferredthem from the Ge
rman doctors.  They came on the 
sly.   

Q:  We re there a lot of nurses? 

A:  We ll, yes.  As ma ny as we needed were ther
e.  Some  of t hem ca me  a s  nurses and some  of 
them learned.   

Q:  And your husband basically ran the whole 
operation or he actually worked on patients. 
A:  Both.  He worked on patients whom he kne
w and who he could treat.  But norma lly he was 
assigned to people to treat or to work in this pl a
ce or that.  We had more 
doctors than we needed 
and we had better doctors than the people outsi de.  Let's put it this way.  Because we ha d doctors 

who were some thing and some body before they came  to the camp. 

Q:  Did your husband ever talk to you about spec
ial concerns with what 
he was trying to do? 
A:  Yes and no.  We  all felt -- everybody feared 
to get out of Theresienstadt because everybody 
was afraid it's worse than Theresienstadt itsel
f.  How much worse and how much other people 
knew than I did, I don't know.   

Q:  But did he talk about special problems  in 
even running the hospital, or things he needed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
18 
 
A:  It was running by itself more or less.  We
 had more doctors than we needed and better 
doctors than they had on the outside.   
Q:  Now what about -- 
I would think for some people maybe
 they would need some  kind of 
social -- psychiatric counseling.  
Wa s that ever done there.  I 
don' know whether it was done as, 
you know, just to help to it as specialty or what. 
 But there were people who did it.  They were 
doctors who did it.  It was for their own better. 
 You know, s o to be able
 to practice and to see 
how it works. 

Q:  It was also a bit of a la
boratory is what you're saying? 
A:  yeah. 

Q:  Now you me ntioned -- well I think -- wasn't  ther
e a famo us psychiatrist there?   Wasn't  there a 
Dr. Frankel?  Did you know hi m?  

A:  I don't reme mber.  We had bett
er doctors than the people on the 
outside.  Let's put it this way. 
Q:  Do you reme mber whether there wa
s much of a problem with suicide? 
A:  Not really.  I mean, I don't re me mber, but I don't think there were ma ny people who 

committed suicide.  There mi ght have been some . 

Q:  You had me ntioned the Germans comi ng in.  
Tell me a little bit about who were the other 
prisoners or inma tes or whatever you want to 
call yourself.  Who you we re. 
 It started off with 
people from Prague and -- 

A:  We ll, I was working for a lawyer and he kept 
me  for as long as they let me  work.  As long as 
I was some one to go to the camp.  So I wasn't  af
fected too much.  But I know that ma ny people 
could not work any mor e because the employers di dn't want to be accused that they were helping 

Jews. 

Q:  This was back in Prague? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  Okay, but when you went to the camp, the ghetto, at that time it was mostly Czech Jews? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
19 
 
A:  Yeah.  Mostly, but then th
ey started to send people from Ge
rmany there too.  And even from 
the ones that were in Holland.  Some  people succ
eeded to get out to Holland and when they got 
hold of them, they took them also. 
Q:  So all these different groups th
at came in, wa s everybody mi xed together? 
A:  They tried to stay together.  The groups that
 came in tried to stay toge ther because they knew 
each other.  But how long could they stay -- they 
sent half of them or 
how ma ny out of the group.  
They were se nt to Poland because Theresienstadt  wasn't  such a big town.   

Q:  So you all had to mi
x together eventually? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  Now when the Germans and Austrians arrived -- you don't reme mber when that is, do you? 

A:  No. 

Q:  When they arrived, did they seem different 
than you?   Did they have
 different expectations? 
A:  They had different expectati
ons, and it went even that far that
 even some  ti me  or one time a 
German said "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us
, if our Fuhrer".  Because they thought, you 
know, since they are Germans, Hitle
r would take care of them better 
than of the Czechs.  But that 
was what some  of the m said, "if our Fuhrer knew" .   

Q:  How did the Czech pe ople react to the German
s who came in -- what did 
they think of them?  
How did you feel? 

A:  We  took them for gr anted.  They came the same  as we, a nd the German Jews, they expected 

to be treated better which is true because "our Fuhrer", but they were not.  And they got assigned 

the same  as the others and then came an order, 
a thousand Jews have to go, so how do you select 
a thousand Jews and don't ma ke a mi stak
e, let's put it this way, or what? 
Q:  Were there ever tensions between the Germans and the Czechs and the people from Holland? 

A:  Oh, sure, sure.  From Holland, not.  Dutch 
people were nice, but the Germans were saying to 
the Czechs, "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us",
 that you don't treat us better.  That was 
tensions.  

Q:  Did that cause problems ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
20 
 
A:  Yeah.  It caused problem not
 to me personally, but I am sure there were bases where it was a 
problem. 
Q:  And didn't some  Da nish people also come? 

A:  They were separate.  They were not allowed 
-- Denmark -- since they had to go they made a 
rule that they ma y not be sent 
to Poland and they even got them
 out of Theresienstadt shortly 
before the wa r ended.  Because they were work
ing for them.  They were our citizens and we 
were responsible for them and they were protect
ing them.  I mean, there were not so terribly 
ma ny, but Denmark took care of their Jews. 

Q:  Were there a lot of children in the camp? 

A:  We ll, the regular family ha
s children and they were sent to
 Theresienstadt.  The children 
came along.  And there were children 
born in Theresienstadt, of course. 
Q:  That was allowed? 

A:  That was allowed.  Well what can you do.  We
 were human beings, and what can you do?   I 
mean the people who had them were huma n beings. 

Q:  But the Germans allowed children to be born? 

A:  Once they were born they didn'
t do anything to them.  The y di
dn't like it, but what could they 
do?   Some time s they sent the parents with
 the children, but that wasn't  as a rule. 
Q:  So women were getting pregnant in the camp ? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  And that was allowed? 

A:  It wasn't  allowed officially.  Whe n she wanted
 to have an abortion, she could have it.  And if 
she did not, they didn't do too much. 

Q:  So they didn't force wome n to have abortions? 

A:  No, not really, but who wanted to have a child
 in a camp like that.  So most of them did have 
abortions on their own really.  On thei r own will. 

Q:  Did you ever get pregnant? 

A:  Did the childre
n live separately? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
21 
 
A:  Some times.  They had some  ca mps where they 
had the children separately if the parents were 
working, both of them.  And some times no. 
Q:  I understand that when the Germans came in, 
the Austrian Jews, they sent a lot of older 
people, a lot of people from hospitals.  Is that true? 

A:  We ll they sent the other ones to Poland.  So 
what they had to send the usually sick or older 
people.  It came  by itself, let's put it this way.   

Q:  That probably change d the balance in
 the camps in terms of working people. 
A:  Yeah.  But as I say, they came fr om Austria or so, and they came.  The people who work they 

were sending to work and the older people rema
ined and they sent them t o Theresienstadt. 
Q:  When they began deporting when they'd ma ke 
the list of a thousand Jews, or whatever, to the 
east, were there certain categories of peopl
e who went first?   Did they send -- 
Q:  Yeah.  They were sending everybody over 65 
or everybody with this and this condition ha s 
to be sent or so.  There were some  instructions. 

Q:  What about women? 

A:  The same.  I mean they said over 65 whethe
r they were female or male, it di dn't matter. 
Q:  What I'm wondering is if they would keep
 the men around longer because they thought they 
were better workers or some thing. 

A:  They mi ght in some  cases.  If some body kne w some thing special they wouldn't let him go 

because they needed his work.   

Q:  Did you feel that wome n were 
treated the same  as me n t here? 
A:  I would say from a J e wish point of view, yes. 

Q:  Who we re the guards there? 

A:  The Germans mostly, but they took some  Je wi
sh people to do this or this as guards.  But 
nothing extra.  Any Czech guards.  The same  as th
e Germans.  They didn't  make any distinctions 
between the Germans or the Czechs.  If
 they needed them they took them. 
Q:  What about all of the prominent Citizens who were there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
22 
 
A:  There were some that were by the Germans 
designated; that they can
not be moved away or 
have be in special quarters.  But there were 
not too ma ny compared to 
the whole population.  But 
they had some  extra people that the Germans want
ed to protect because they thought they would 
need them more.  If they know something.  
Q:  What kind of people were they; wh
at kind of people are we talking about? 
A:  I couldn't tell you.  So me  scientists. 

Q:  And they had special privileges. 

A:  Not special privileges, but they lived in be
tter quarters.  They had a house assigned where 
they lived together more or less.  To be av
ailable when the Germans wanted something from 
them.  Some  advice or so. 

Q:  Were these people resented or  were they respected? 

A:  I don't think people cared too much.  Ther
e were not so many and so I don't think people 
cared too much. 

Q:  Now Theresiens
tadt was thought of as a modern camp? 
A:  That is what they said, yes. 

Q:  And what does that mean?  

A:  They didn't  send people away imme diately.  They had some  extra food some ti me s.  They 

treated us nicer than ma ybe some wh
ere else.  I don't know much more. 
Q:  Tell me  about the cultural life there.  Wa s there much? 

A:  Yes.  Because everybody who knew some thing tried to apply it for his own sake and for the 

sake of the others.  So I don't know e verything, bu
t we had pretty much to be proud of.  Let's put 
it this way.  Because of the people who were th
ere and said about thos
e things, were talking 
about those things.  I don't  think 
I could tell you too much about it.  
Q:  Let me  a s k you some  questions. 

A:  Okay. 

Q:  We 'r e talking about music, poetry, theater. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
23 
 
A:  Yes.  Music we had if some body was a musi ci
an who was writing music, he wrote it, and he 
had a chance to have it worked on      Poetry, it 
was a personal thing.  Yes.  If he wanted to write 
he was allowed to write, whether he would us
e it some where or not it was up to him. 
Q:  Theater? 

A:  Theater, yes we had some .  
We  ha d some .  But we were bett
er than the outside because we 
had actors and we had seamstresses who ma ybe some
ti mes did some things for them to wear, but 
we were lucky that we had a cultural life. 

Q:  Do you thing that 
helped sustain people? 

A:  I would say yes.  In ma ny cases, yes.  They didn't feel like being enemies.  

Q:  Was there a lot of this; were th
ere a lot of musicians and concerts? 
A:  I know there were some .  I don't  know        
 .  Because they did it hi dden or so.  You know, if 
they could pe rform some where and the Germans w
ouldn't have to see it, they would do it.  And 
if the Germa ns couldn't see it we couldn't see it either at ma ny times.  But we had pretty good 

cultural life.  Thank God. 

Q:  Did you go to a lot of these performa nces? 

A:  I went.  I didn't go to a lot but I wa s allo
wed to go.  And being on the top I went -- I knew 
where they were. 

Q:  So did the Germans allow this; did they encour age it? 

A:  They didn't  encourage it but they did not pr
ohibit it expressly.  And I 
believe some of them 
even went to see it because they di dn't have it on the outside . 

Q:  We re there certain things that 
were not allowed po
litically or -- 
A:  Well politically maybe, but 
I don't  know whi c h they were.  Others ma ybe too but I don't 
know about it. 

Q:  Where would the performe rs perform?  

A:  We ll in the camp we had rooms e nough and they 
could be guarded.  Le t's put it this way.  If 
the Germans were close, 
the lights went out.   
Q:  Unless it was one of these that was allowed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
24 
 
A:  Yes.  But otherwise, the li
ghts went out and 
that was it.   
Q:  What about educational activities?   Wa
s there any kind of teaching or instruction?  
A:  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Hidden, but it was.  
We  had teachers enough.  We  had experienced people 
enough.  And they did teach the 
children and even the grown-up
s.  We  had more than the 
outside.  Because we had the people outside.  They 
were not allowed or they didn't have them.   
Q:  Do you think the children had a pretty reasonable life in there? 
A:  Yes and no.  I mean, what do you say about re
asonable?  They were allowed to sing, to 
gather together, to -- I think they ha
d pretty reasonable life as a whole. 
Q:  Were they treated special? 

A:  I don't know whether they were treated special because they were children, but whatever 

could be done for the children was done. 

Q:  What about the old people? 

A:  That was sad.  They couldn't take care of th
emselves and the old people was a sad story.  If 
they didn't have any relatives who would bring th
em some thing extra to eat or so, it wasn't  
enough to eat and things like that. 
 To be old in Theresienstadt 
without having fa mily was very 
sad I would say.  

Q:  Wa s there a kind of a system for taking care of them?  

A:  There was, but not everybody co
uld get in and there were too ma
ny to be taken care of by too 
few and things like that.  That was sad. 

Q:  We re some  of the musicians 
or artists given any kind of a speci
al treatme nt or did they have 
more time to practice, or anything like that? 

A:  They could practice.  Whet
her they had more time or not, I don't know.  They could practice 
and if they ha d special treatme nt it was 
from the Jews, not from the Germans. 
Q:  Did you have to have tickets
 to go to these performa nces? 
A:  I didn't, but ma ybe some  had.  I was, you know
, a relative of the lead
ing physician, so I didn't 
have to.  I could go wherever I felt li
ke, or could, or when I had time. 
Q:  Wa s there money exc hanged in the camp?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
25 
 
A:  Not offi cially, but there were people
 who exchanged money for some  reason among 
themselves.  I couldn't tell.   
Q:  Wasn't  t here a national currency from that ghetto? 

A:  Yes, there was.  But I don't re me mber too mu
ch about it.  We got a
ssigned at the beginning a 
certain amount.  It wasn't  too much, and what we 
did with it, they didn't care.  So some people 
probably did some thing and some  people didn't. 

Q:  One more question about al
l this activity with schools or 
music -- and there was political 
activity as well was there? 

A:  It wasn't  officially allowed, let's put it this
 wa y; political.  Music and that was, you know, we 
were better musicians and we had better mu
sicians inside than there were outside. 
Q:  Did all of this culture kind of seem at odds with the situation? 

A:  I couldn't tell.  We had to take it as it cam
e, and whether it was or not I couldn't tell.  
Q:  You didn't see m strange to you? 

A:  No, not to me  because I had acce
ss to those things, so I wouldn't know. 
Q:  I guess what I'm wondering is th
at in the mi dst of this horrible 
war it's interesting that ther e 
was so much vitality. 

A:  We  didn't look outside.  We  took it as it came
 inside the ghetto, a
nd what happened outside 
didn't have any influence any way.  So as long as 
they didn't come  to beat us or to take away 
things from us, we didn't know
.  We  didn't want to know. 
Q:  Do you think that this represented 
kind of a spiritual resistance in a way? 
A:  Maybe to some people, yes.  But I couldn't te
ll.  I took things as they came.  I was lucky.  
Because I came there early and some one asked me 
if I wanted to work, and I said "what else 
would I do" and I got where I was. 

Q:  Now since this was supposed to 
be a model camp, were there visitors? 
A:  They brought us some  some ti mes, but they pr
epared us and they said what we can say and 
what we can't , or how well they treated the Je
ws.  To show how well 
they treated the Jews. 
Q:  How else did they prepare the camp for these visits? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
26 
 
A:  Clean up everything and they gave us some
 things to show like some  more food or some  
things like that.  But unfortunately they did not
 come  to often, and because  what they gave us 
they took it then away -- they 
gave to one part and they t
ook it away from the other. 
Q:  Who we re these visitors? 

A:  I couldn't tell.  They were some  Germans 
or some Dutch people.  Some from Denmark.  
There were Genish (ph) Jews ther
e.  They treated the Genish Jews
 better.  They gave them more 
to eat and when the Genish came they put them 
in their place, you know, told them what they 
ma y say or what they may not say.  
Or took them outside to talk.   
Q:  Do you reme mber the Red Cross visits? 

A:  Not really. 

Q:  Did things change as time went on?   You were there a long time. 

A:  We ll in the beginning, we didn't have too mu
ch to eat, and we didn't have -- we couldn't go 
anywhere, and then they gave us mo re to eat and th
ey let us go visit each ot
her or things like that. 
Q:  So you had more freedom after a while? 

A:  Yes.  Inside the ghetto we could move ar
ound freely.  After they took all the not-Jews out of 
the town.  We could move freely. 

Q:  Did it ever get really crowded? 

A:  It depends what you feel like crowded.  You 
know, if you think five people in a small room 
is crowded then it was crowded.  Less was not crowded.   

Q:  So it didn't  change that much 
in terms of housing 
or the population. 
A:  No.  Except when they moved the other people
 out we lived in the whole town and we could 
move around.  Before that we had to have passes to 
go from one  caserna (ph)  to the other or if 
we had to work some where we had to have passes. 

Q:  Now do you reme mb er there was some
 fortress where people were taken. 
A:  Yes, but it was outside Theresienstadt
.  The name  was Terezin but it was outside 
Theresienstadt. 

Q:  What was this fortress, what happened there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
27 
 
A:  It was a prison. 
Q:  Why would some bo
dy be sent there? 
A:  For reasons you go to prison.  The only thing 
is they didn't send Jews there as a rule.  
Because they had for the Jews enough places.  
Theresienstadt and T
hurzor (ph), which was 

worse than the fortress. 

Q:   What was this? 

A:  Theresienstadt to the east of the camps.  Ex
termination camps where they didn't have to have 
anything extra. 

Q:  So there wasn't  too much of punishme nts and 
beatings or hangings, any 
of that horrible stuff 
that went on elsewhere? 

A:  We ll inside Theresienstadt, 
not too much.  There were some  hangings at the beginning.  I 
think they hanged about nine people.  And they'd
 ma ke big propaganda with it.  But then they 
didn't do it any more.  It was too muc h problems 
and it was easier to send them to Poland and 
then do with them what they wanted to,          . 
Q:  We re the supervisors or the guards when you 
were working -- they mostly treated the people 
pretty well? 

A:  Regularly.  They didn't  beat us unless 
some body did something.  They didn't do too much 
bad things to us.  Because they were afraid 
if we should survive they mi ght get it after it. 
Q:  What else can you reme mber about life in th
e camp or something that mi ght be important to 
reme mber in history? 

A:  We ll I wouldn't know.  Since I didn't live ther
e a regular life I can't  tell you exactly what 
bothered other people mostly.  

Q:  But you must have had frie
nds who knew what was going on. 
A:  Yes, but they didn't talk too much. 

Q:  Your mo ther? 

A:  My mot her was the same  as I, more or less,
 pr ivileged.  Because she was my mot her she live 
in a small room with seven people.  She had re
gular food like the others, but just to live in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
28 
 
small place was an advantage.  My father lived in 
a big place but he didn't feel it that  bad.  What 
he did -- he was repairing sewing ma chines.  Ne
ver in his life before did he see a sewing 
machine.  They put him there so he di
d what he could and it saved his life. 
Q:  Wa s there any effort at resistan
ce or any underground activity like -- 
A:  I am sure there were, but I don't know about it.  If I knew I didn't know not any more. 
Q:  So because of this relationship you had -- 

A:  I was protected.  They couldn't send me  awa y without him and they didn't send him.  They 

sent him and he said "if they don't call you separa
tely I don't want you to come at all" because 
here I know where I leave you in and there he do
n't know what's happening.  But he didn't come.  
He was sent directly to the gas chamber because
 he  knew too much.  He could have told the 
outside Germany what wa
s going on more than I. 
Q:  He didn't share a lo
t of that with you though? 
A:  We ll I think I knew about everything, but
 the Germans di dn't know how much I knew. 
Q:  So you did know what was going on? 

A:  I knew more or less what was going on.  I mea
n, I didn't want to believe what I heard.  That's 
another thing.  They were saying 
they put people in gas chambers and they killed them there or 
God knows what.  But it couldn't be true.  It was so 
horrible that it couldn't  
be true in my way of 
thinking. 

Q:  This relationship must have really help
ed you cope with your 
life there a lot better? 
A:  Oh, sure.  First of all, I had some body whom 
I loved.  Since he was the leading physician he 
had a room for himself which I could share with 
him.  I had an extra bed to move away, but I 
could share the room with him so I can
't  compare my life with anybody else's. 
Q:  Towards the end were there a lot more deportations out? 

A:  I think so because they tried to get as 
ma ny people away so they wouldn't have so ma ny 

people to tell about them; 
you know, about the Germans. 
Q:  So it was more regular? 

A:  Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
29 
 
Q:  Close to the end of the war didn't they 
start bringing people from the camps west and 
some ti me s camp survivors would come  into Terezin? 
A:  Yes, they would, but they said it wasn't  true. 
 It was so horrible that they were trying to say, 

but I didn't believe it. 

Q:  Where were they comi ng from? 

A:  When they were in Poland, for instance, a
nd escaped some  way or another, or the camp was 
liberated and they could ge
t out and came to Terezin. 

Q:  From which camp? 

A:  In Poland.  The extermination camps or 
so.  Some  people survived.  They didn't put 
everybody in the gas chamber.  Wh en they came a
nd were telling us I wouldn't believe it.  I 
thought it was so terrible, I couldn't believe it. 

Q:  What did they look like? 

A:  By the time  they ca me to Terezin they had some thing to eat and they looked -- to me , they 

didn't look too terrible because I saw 
in Terezin terribl e looking people too. 
Q:  We re they shaved and they were in uniform? 

A:  They were not in unifor m, but they were shav
ed.  If someone wanted to grow a beard he did 
it, but it didn't  i mpress me or it didn't see m funny to me. 

Q:  So these people who came out, they didn't look too bad? 

A:  By the time  they ca me to Terezin they were not so bad. 

Q:  These people certainly weren't that emaciated in Terezi n?  

A:  No.  We  had to eat.  They gave us so
me ti me s not too much, but we had our meals and 
Terezin was a camp that they show
ed off how well they treat Jews. 
Q:  That's  why I was wondering, because it woul
d seem that the people who came from the east 
must have looked very different from you people. 

A:  Yes.  But as I say, by the time  they came, they had some thing to eat or the Germans let them 

eat some.  But I was lucky.  I came there early 
and some one who knew me  said "do you want to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
30 
 
work" and that saved my life and my parents su
rvived with me  which was unusual, but thank 
God. 
Q:  So tell me , what happened at the e
nd?   How were you liberated, what we re the 
circumstances? 

A:  Well they came and say that the war is over and 
since I didn't have anywhe
re to go, I stayed.   
Q:  Who came and said that? 

A:  I don't know who came and said it, but -- 

Q:  Who liberated you? 

A:  I don't know.  The war was over and that was it. 

Q:  You don't re me mber that the last 
week or so the Red Cross took over? 
A:  No.  I mean, you say took over.  It didn't con
cern me  too much.  I didn't  have anywhere to go 
so I was waiting for my parents to get establishe
d a little and in the meantime, I was very content 
in ma king my living. 

Q:  You stayed at the camp? 

A:  Yes.  I stayed at the camp. 

A:  How long? 

A:  I thing about two mo nths. 

Q:  What were you doing there? 

A:  I was working in the office tryi
ng to -- sort of the th
ings that still had to be done still or what 
-- I don't reme mber anymore what was to be done. 

Q:  We re you helping people find families? 

A:  Well not even that .  The fa milies, when they were outside, they came in and otherwise, they 

were together anyway.   

Q:  Had your parents gone back to Pr ague 

A:  They went with me  back to Prague, yes.  
We  s urvived all three in 
Theresienstadt, thank God. 

Q:  When you went back to
 Prague what was it like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
31 
 
A:  It's hard to say.  Someone said we  were as
signed an apartment and we  moved in and my boss 
whom I wor ked for before I went to the camp said if you want to come  back to work you are 
welcome, so I had my job and I had some where to
 sleep, and my parents were with me so I took 

it just  for granted. 

Q:  We re the people you knew before the war 
there?   Were a lot of them there st ill? 
A:  Some of them were and some of them -- 
well we didn't know what's going on which is, of 
course, not true, but they didn't 
want to so they wouldn't be blamed that they didn't help anybody. 
Q:  So here you had been away for about four years? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Did it seem strange to come  back like nothing had happened? 

A:  Well I took it for granted.  I got an apartm
ent and my parents were with me so I took it 
some how for granted.  I was thankf
ul that I survived but it seem
ed strange to people who didn't 
go through that.  But I just took it for granted. 

Q:  Did a lot of the Jewish community return to Pr ague? 

A:  Not a lot, but some  did.  I mean, they even 
returned when they were 
in England because they 
couldn't find nice jobs in England and they had sti
ll their pr operties in Pr ague so they came to 
claim that. 

Q:  Did you think a lot about Dr. Monk at that time?    

A:  What could I do?   I knew he 
was not alive.  What could I do? 
Q:  I meant to ask you one other question about the ghetto. 

A:  Okay.  Go ahead. 

Q:  Wa s there much religion going on in there?
  Were people observing Shabbat?   We re they 
celebrating holidays? 

A:  The ones who were religious outside were 
religious inside.  And 
the ones like me who took 
things for granted, we just lived on. 

Q:  It was allowed? 

A:  It was allowed, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344

Q:  So here you were in Pra
gue working for the lawyer again.  How long did that last? 
Q:  Until I left Czechoslovakia. 
Q:  Why did you leave Czechoslova ki a? 

A:  Because I met my husband.  We were ma
rried and he went so I went with him.  
Q:  So you me t another ma n 
and got  ma rried in Prague. 
A:  My husband. 

Q:  Your husband today. 

A:  So he went away so I went
 too.  He went out.  He said I 
won't stay in this place any more. 
Q:  Where did you go? 

A:  Venezuela.  I think we  went to Venezuela first, to Paris, I think, then we  went to Venezuela 

because he ha d his relatives there. 

Q:  Was it at all di ffi cult starting anew? 

A:  I didn't think.  As long as I was getting just
 for myself, I didn't care.  The ma in thing, I had 

some where to sleep and then               
  the population 450 the first da
y I we nt out of the house, 
the neighbor came and said "welcome". 
 So it was a nice thing to start.  
Q:  Do you reme mber what year you went to Venezuela? 

A:  1939 I would say. 

Q:  To Venezuela? 

A:  No, I think -- 

Q:  A few y ears after the war? 

A:  No, I think it was -- I don't know.  I went 
to the refugee camp and someone came there and 
said we are going to Venezuela.  
I said "where is that?"  They 
showed me and said to come  so 
that if we find up to 50 people we grant 
them visas, so I went.  That simp le. 
                       
 SHORT BREAK IN TAPE
 
                       
A:  I am confused myself. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
33 
 
Q:  So we'r e  confused together 
A:  Good. 

Q:  Okay.  So you went back to Prague, your pa
rents were there and you worked for the lawyer, 

you stayed there awhile.  Do you reme mber what 
the next transition was?   What happened next? 
A:  I didn't want to stay there because I was af
raid that something like that  will again happen and 
I crossed the border into Germany, of all pl aces
, into the refugee camp and some one came there 

and said "we are going to Venezuela".  I said "where
 is that?" and they said "the console told us 
we need people like you".  If you signed up to
 -- I don't know -- 20 people, we get some visas.  
So I went there to get a visa.  I had nobody else 
to care about and I knew if I worked some where 
I will have so mewhere to sleep and 
some thing to eat.  So why not?   
Q:  Your parents went with you or not? 

A:  No.  Not at that time .  They were 
not with me .  I let them then later on. 
Q:  Do you reme mber the name  of that refugee camp? 

A:  No, not really. 

Q:  So then you went to Venezuela? 

A:  Yes.  And I got a job from the newspaper. 
 It was my husband's cousin and he came  there 
after I worked there about two year
s or two and a half years.  He
 came there to vi sit hi s cousin 
and since he was country doctor in Hugh (ph), 
Illinois, population 450, he 
proposed to me  and I 
said yes.  Very simple. 

Q:  So you me t your present husband in Venezuela? 

A:  Yes.   

Q:  And was he living -- wher
e was he living at the time? 
A:  In Hugh (ph), Illinois, populat
ion 450.  He was a country doctor. 
Q:  So that was that and you moved to Illinois? 

A:  I moved to Illinois. 

Q:  How wa s it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
34 
 
A:  Very nice.  Very pleasant.  The first day 
I came out of the house the neighbor came  and said 
"Welcome , you must me Mrs. Schleissner
."  So how much better can you go? 
Q:  So your first impressions of Ame r ica were pretty nice? 

A:  Yes, I can say that. 

Q:  Anything surprising that you remember? 

A:  It has been a long time ago. 

Q:  What, when you look back on this period of ti
me  -- are there certain images that stick in your 
mi nd?  

A:  What do you mean by this period? 

Q:  This period during the war when you were
 in Prague and then in Theresienstadt. 
A:  Not really, I took things as they came and 
some how I said, well, that's the only thing I can 
say.  My parents were right with me , we came 
all three back to Prague and the good Lord was 
good to me .  I can say the only 
thing I can explain things. 
Q:  Did it strengthen your belief in God at all? 

A:  Not really.  I never wa s religious God knows me
.  But believe there is 
some thing.  Direct the 
world. 

Q:  And you still do? 

A:  I still do because if I look outside
, for instance, what else can I do? 
Q:  Do you think that these experiences during the 
war had any sort of long term i mpact on you?   
The way you think or -- 

A:  How couldn't they?   But I don'
t think about it as I said.  
I take it as it as it comes. 
Q:  You never think about it? 

A:  It was too hard some times to think. 

Q:  Do you think that what we learned duringthose years, what happened, has any relevance 

today?  

A:  To some  people, ma ybe.  
Some  people forget imme diately. 
Q:  Do you think this could ever happen again? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344  
35 
 
A:  I hope not, but you never know.  The world is crazy. 
Q:  Do you ever wonder why you were lucky? 

A:  The good Lord was good to me .  That's  the only thing I can say, and I believe.  When my 

sister went to Israel I di dn't  want to go to Is
rael because I wasn't  Jewish enough, or I wasn't  -- I 

said othe r people who believe in it should go fi
rst, I don't want to take anybody's place, and 

things like that.  Today I th
ink it was  crazy, but it tu
rned out to be okay so -- 
Q:  Is there anything 
else you want to say? 
A:  Not really.  If you want to ask some thing ask anything you want to, but I don't have any extra 

to say.  I am lucky I am here.  That's the only thing I can say.  I am lucky I met my husband, 

although he studied in my home  
town and I didn't know him t hen.  I had to go to Venezuela to 
meet hi m.  When I went to Venezuela I didn't know where it was.  They had to show me  on the 

ma p.  The good Lord, that's the only thing I can say. 

Q:  Thank you.  

A:  Thank you.
