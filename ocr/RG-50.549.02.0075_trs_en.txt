Answer: Good morning, Nina. 
Q: We™re going to start -- we had a little conversation a few weeks ago about 

where we would start this interview, and 
I would like to ask you if you could tell 
me if there is anything 
that you would like to go ba
ck over from your original 
interview, to add to it. Maybe there™s 
some new information th at you™ve come 
across, or do you want to -- 
I™m talking in generalities. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Not specific issues, specific dates or anything. 
A: Well -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075

Q: But is there a-any -- any info rmation th
at you™ve come across about your years 
before, say 1945 that you™d like to 
add to that original interview? 
A: Before 1945. 
Q: More or less. 

A: I was going to -- to go over the last pa
rt of my interview for the first person, 
where I stopped with  the arrival in Israel. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And to go over that, a-as we -- I left
 Cyprus, and f -- January first of 1948 -- 
™49, I™m sorry. December ™47 -- January firs
t, 1949. We arri -- 
we proceeded from 
Cyprus on a small fishing boat 
that came from Israel with 
permit to fish in Turkish 
waters, which is the northern part of C
yprus, and by prearrangement with the help 
of the Greeks on the island, th-the ship
 -- th-the fishers-man came close to the 
north ern edge of Cyprus, with flashlight
s and signs and inflatable boats. They 
picked us up from the s
hore wh ere the Greeks brought us and put us on that 
fishing boat named Karishe, a
nd took us to Israel. Over
 there the British were still 
contro lling the Haifa port, and we had to 
find a place where to land, which was in 
Netanya.  
Q: How many people, roughly? I mean -- and how lo ng did it take? 

A: It -- it w as about 80 - 90 people, b
ecause the exits or the escapes from the 
Cyprus camp s were arranged of -- consis
ted of eight to 10 people per night. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075

Q: Right. 
A: Once outside, the Greeks 
would pick us up and takeus into an orange grove by 
the warehouse and lock us up 
there, so all day we could not come out, but at night 
they would come open the doors and we ro
amed somehow, in the orange grove.  
Q: Hold  on one second. 
A: Okay , the fishing boat dropped us o
ff on Netanya. They have -- two buses 
waited for us with food, clothes, blankets
, whatever we could use, and took us 12 
or 15 mile eastward, right across from Ne
tanya, a pla -- a place called Baykleet. 
That was a -- a place where -- of induction 
to the im -- Israeli 
army. As a former 
Cyprus senior officer in the Haganah,
 I was immediately put in ch arge of 
inducting a-all sorts of newcomers with  my  several languages that I spoke, 
Romanian, Hebrew, French and some Germ
an , I was able to make the proper 
arrangements for these youngsters and k
eep them there for a while. The policy 
was that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what
 their future plans are, 
and send them to units where they  could 
begin into that line of wo rk. I was kept 
there til March the 15
th
 or eight -- 16
th
, and as I ex-expressed my  desire to study 
medicine, I was assigned to a military hos
pital. Was a formerly
 British hospital, 
and the hospital was called Tel HaSh
omer. Tel Levinsky that became Tel 
HaShomer. And that™s where I spent my next
 30 month in  Israel. At this hospital I 
was supposed to be a -- every two month at
 a different, or a specialty wards, but I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
5
started at orthopedics, and s-so -- liked it 
so much that I stayed
 there all the time. 
Orthopedics and paraplegics. And it was e
nough t-to come in contact with Israeli 
veterans or wounded soldiers, to become
 so convinced that -- of our righteous 
battle. All they wanted, these amp u tees a
nd paraplegics, they wanted to get well 
so they can go back
 to the front and fight again. Ah -- 
Q: And you would talk with them, and 
you would talk with them about these 
things, not just about 
their -- their injuries? 
A: Of course -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- of course. That™s what kept them a
live, the hope to  get better, for a purpose. 

The same time we had new immigrants fro
m Arab countries that
 -- that were so 
depriv ed of medical attention th at some of
 them were absolutely
 paralyzed, or -- 
or -- they couldn™t fu nction. On e partic
ular case I reme mb er, a young kid that 
would walk only on four, kn
ees and hands and he was 
brought to us from Yemen 
[indecipherable]. And, smart little kid, bu
t he just couldn™t walk, and ma -- Dr. 
Goldman called me an d had a little talk with 
me that if I agree 
and go along with 
him to do what he asks me to, I would -- 
we could make that child walk again. 
And we talked to -- the first thing he said
, the first problem I have is you have to 
sleep with him, in the same room. And du
ring the days we™ll operate and at night 
he is all yours. So with in a short period of time we realized -- we obtained th at we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
6
-- we realized that, an
d the child started walk
ing with crutches and 
[indecipherable] but ultimately 
he walked w
ith one cane. 
Q: Hm. 
A: That™s just one example. Other examples
 were that many of 
the high officers in 
the military  came to that hospital for in
juries in the back
 and the knees. I 
remember [indecipherable] Lo
ng was one of the patients,
 I guess, Dayan and some 
other big officers as well, as Holocaust 
survivors. What was his name, he was 

involved in the Warsaw gh
etto uprising. Not [indecipherable] Levitz, but his 
deputy. [indecipherable]. So, that™s wher
e I spent three month in Israel, during 
which time my family starte
d coming ba -- over from Romania in 1949. My  sister 
came, married, with her child
. In 1950 my parents arri
ved and in 1951 my  other 
sister. One brother stayed in Roma
nia til 1959 and ha -- arrived later. 
Q: Were you helping all of them, were 
you making it possible for them to come , 
or did they have some co
nnections of their own? 
A: No, no, no. They personally in
itiated and arrived in Israel.  
Q: And when you were working in this ho
spital for 30 months, that™s almost three 
years, did you in tend to stay in Israel 
that whole time? Was it your intention to go 
to school there and -- and try and ma
ke a life in Israel, or were you -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: That was your idea? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
7
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: In fact, 12 - 13 or 15 hours a day th
at I u-used to work  brought me to 
exhaustion and the doctors wo
uld send me to Jerusalem for 10 - 15 days of R and 
R. And those days I would visit the univer
sity, which was then 
at [indecipherable] 
a big Catholic school that was changed -- 
was given to  the university for beginners 
and just visitor -- visiting studen ts. That wa
s part of the R and R in Jerusalem,  so 
that after two years of com
pulsory military in the hospit
al, they asked me to stay 
longer, and I stayed another six months, 
to make it into 30 months service. And 
that was the end of 1951 already, that I 
realized that the uni
versity in Jerusalem 
had no medical school or no beginnin
g of medical school. They had many 
students that started out abroad , and only wi
th the third year they would start them 
in the hospital, supervised by famous 
docto rs and this way progress towards 
graduation. But the first two years they 
couldn™t have, they needed dissections. 
The Orthodox Jews wouldn™t allow 
Jews to be dissected. That™s -- 

Q: And you needed 
those first years. 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: You had -- you hadn't had that yet. 

A: No. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
8
Q: What -- u-up until this point what -- wh
at kind of educati
on did you have, what 
-- equivalent to wh at? 
A: In Europe and Romania, I graduated fr
om high school with a baccalaureate it™s 
called, a high school diploma. And realizi
ng all this and being in correspondence 
with a brother I had in Detroit, who arrived there in 1946, maybe ™47, I cannot 
pinpoint it, but I corresponded with him 
and explained the condi -- situation and 
he brought up th e idea of coming here. And 
I liked it, and I prepared for it in a 
sense. I started all the necessary 
arrangements for going to America. 
Q: Even though your family 
was coming over from Romania? 
A: Yes, they all agreed that it™s ro ugh, 
tough, and I™m still 
young to recoup, or 
recover. So, late in 1951, I started the pr
eparations or investigations into -- for 
going to  America. Immediately I got me a English teacher, for mo re -- better 

English. I started the passport applications
 and visas for the Americans. First they 
indicated I get the visa and get to Ameri
ca and there si -- approach th e college. 
Then they informed 
me that no, it™s the other way around. First you have to be 
accepted by a school in the United States, 
and on that basis we can grant you a 
visa for a student. In Detroit my  brothe
r had a brother-in-law who was a professor 
at Wayne State University, and he made a
ll these arrangements on the basis of that 
high school diploma and obtained from th
em a letter that I am accepted for the 
semester beginning on September 12 or so
, 1952. But nothing was ready in Israel 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075

for me to go. So I visited the American embassy, undergo -- went a test in 
English. All arrangements began to s -- to
 -- to shape up to  the point where I 
received a visa and we bought a ticket at
 TWA and started my
 trip on November 
the second of 1952. 
Q: Before you went, your 
parents had already come? 
A: 1950 they arrived. 

Q: They had already co me, and your 
-- had brothers and sisters there. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was it a -- difficult for you to go? Was 
it a wrenching, emo
tionally, to leave? I 
mean -- 

A: It had to be, but they themselves we
re in bad shapes, re
ally. All they could 
afford or find were very lim
iting -- limited housing conditions. The first sister that 
came in ™49 had a one room apartment.It™s the same room with -- 1950 my 

parents arrived -- had to stay with them 
for awhile. Then the parent moved out and 
the other sister arrived. When her husband
 realized what™s going on, he took off 
into the desert, to B™eyr-She
va, and there he found all th
ey wanted. A lot of work -
- he was in the build ing area, the build ing 
business, and he build up th-the Negev, 
the desert, all the way to the Dead Sea, 
kibbutzim and so on. So  slowly, slowly 
things settled in Israel, but 
my  going was part of their 
settlement and after leaving 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
10
the hospital and [indecipherable] to take 
off fo r America, I was unemp loyed -- oh, 
no, I worked for the [ind
ecipherable] right in Jaffa
, where my parents lived. 
Q: I don™t know what that is, what is that? 
A: The [indecipherable] is th
e organization of all the Yishuvim, of all the Israeli 

kibbutzim and mo sh avim and all sorts of 
settlements, they are the government™s 
arm that su pplies them with administra
tion and also money, funds for all the 
necessities. Ag -- agricultu
re implements, agricultu
ral implements, modern 
agriculture -- tractors, plowshares, a-all 
sorts of things. And 
I worked there for 
four or five month. And -- while taking 
steps towards my leav
ing. The trip itself 
was problematic. At the time ther
e were no straight flights -- 
Q: Excuse me, before we go
 into the trip I want to
 ask you one mo re question 
about your time in Israel if you don™t mind.  
A: Yes? 
Q: You were there at a -- when 
the State of Israel was formed. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you were there lo
ng enough, and -- I would think, to feel some 
identification with Israeli aspirations 
and because you m-met so ma ny of these 
former soldiers and injured soldiers, and -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and had conversations with them, and -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
11
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: -- and you were a young man, and prob
ably had so me idealism. Did -- did you 
feel a -- Israeli a-at that point? Did you fe
el like you were giving up something, or 
did you think you were going
 to co me back, or was there any issue there for you 
of -- of -- of identity with the Israeli ca
use? Or were you just
 so focused on getting 
your education and that, i-it was a side -- 

A: The European  experience plus the Cyprus
 retention of our going -- one year in  
Cyprus was enough to -- to store up venom, or -- or ambition to get out, do 
something mo re. And I did all I could duri
ng these 30 month, that™s why I stayed 
longer, because I saw what is 
needed. Bu t at that point I 
realized that there™s very 
little I can do at the higher level, that Ican do there, even though I travel and 
toured and visited all that historic pl
aces, and the military  places where famous 
battles took place. Traveled the coun
try it -- north and south, a lot to 
[indecipherable]. And more and more I b
ecame convinced that if I stay at that 
point, I can work  at the [indecipherable].  
I spent some time in Jeru salem taken just 
a biolo -- biology classes, mo re 
or less unrelated to medicine. 
Q: Mm-hm, but you weren't going to become a doctor? 

A: I did at that point -- more personally I 
was sure, or felt I can do a lot for these 
wounded people. And all my  superiors at
 the hospital called me Dr. Haim and 
they thought I could make -- I w
ould make a big -- a good docto r. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
12
Q: Uh-huh. So, i-i-it was this very strong dr
ive that you had to be a doctor and you 
-- and that wasn™t going to 
happen if you stayed around. 
A: No, it was not going to happen. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Reality came in the first week in Amer
ica, that in America you don™t just go to 
medical school from high school as you do in
 Ro mania, as my  wife went for -- at 

the age of 17 she went to medical school. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: In America you go into pre-me
d, and that takes four years. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, geez. 

A: And after that, if you push and qualif
y -- I kept applying fo r medical schools. 
So I -- I started this four year of pre-me
d, and I started liking it because at Wayne 
University -- number one, I arrived in No
vember the fourth or fifth, into a 
semester th at started September 15. A
nd it was way up above my possibilities to 

catch up and do any good. S-So  they put me
 into an English fo
r foreign students, 
which is for no credit and it doesn™t matterh o w well you do. I was able to do very 

well, especially in the writing, and I had 
to  take a class on government, which was 
totally strange to me. One -- in the -- in history, but European  history, it was easy 

for me. And from Novemb
er til January the 15
th
 or 20
th
, when the semeste r ended, 
that was a real killer.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
13
Q: Frustrating. 
A: Unbelievable. That™s the story of Am
erica. If I had the -- the money, I would 
have turn ed around an d gone right back. 
Q: Back to Israel? 

A: Back to Israel. 
Q: In those first coup -- in those first few months.  
A: On the first half a y ear or one year. 

Q: Because it seemed like such a long -- 
A: Such a -- 
Q: -- impossibly long. 

A: -- difficult, difficult obstacles. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And money-wise, I did not come with
 money. My  brother who came to pick 
me up and did all these things prep aring 
for me, he was not we
ll-to-do, and I felt 
very bad and very guilty and 
was ready to do anything. 

Q: Mm-hm. Let me -- let me
 turn this tape over.  
End of Tape One, Side A

Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Haim Solomon.
 This is tape number one, 
side B. What -- you™re in 
Detroit now, it™s -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- late in  the year in 1952. 
A: Yes. 
Q: You™re living with your brother. Wh
at did your brother do at this point? 

A: Really, clearly, I don™t know, but we 
had an uncle that had the business in 
Detroit, but he lived in
 New York, and so my br
other, somehow, managed his 
businesses. Business was in the ma
nufacturing of shuffleboard -- 
Q: Hm. Equipment? 

A: -- equipment. 
Q: Huh. 
A: Yes. Horrible, because some of these 
shuffleboards were installed in bars and 
in -- and I had to go with my  brother 
and collect. If you know the shuffleboard , 
you open the box and you co un
t the money and half goes to the bar, and half -- 
Q: They were -- so they were games? 
A: Games. 

Q: Bar games -- 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
15
Q: -- kind of. Uh-huh. Huh. 
A: And people -- 
Q: And then you started full tim
e taking classes in January -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- 1953. 
A: That was be -- starting -- becoming a lo
t simpler and easier. In the meantime I -
- I me t some other Israeli students at the university. A lot of Jewish students came 
to us. Detroit had something called a Z
OA house, the Zionist Organization of 
America house. And every week end th ey 
would -- all the Zionists would meet 
there, but on weekends they would give 
it to us and we brought together all the 
Israelis and all the American Jewish student
s, and we sang, we danced, we ate, we 
fraternized. The whole atmosphere became 
warmer and more reliab le, and more -- 
you could turn to  any of these American
 stu d ents for orientation, for advice, 
etcetera. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So you starte
d to feel more comfortable. 
A: Start to feel more comfortable. Cla
sses were easier. At the university, every 

student is assigned to an  advisor, and mi
ne was a Dr. Theodo
ro . Dr. Theodoro was 
the daughter of the ambassador from Thaila
nd and London. So 
he-her teacher was 
Chaim Weitzman. When I came to her with
 my name of Haim, she -- come from 
Israel, she caught me, you don™t want to
 study medicine, you want to study 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
16
microbiology, because you™re going back
 to the Hebrew references of Chaim 
Weitzman and tell me mo re of what you 
did. He was her professor, but Ch aim 
Weitzman work ed with an organism, a bact
erium that he forced into  producing 
acetone. The bacterium is called Clos
tridium acetobutylicum Weitzmani. 
Q: Hm, named after him.  
A: The -- this organism, if you feed it wh
atever is good for -- it prefers, this 
bacterium, it produces acetone an
d butyl alcohol, or Vitamin B
2
. Chaim Weitz man  
was able to inhibit its second part 
production and en  -- and en courag e it to 
produce acetone, which the British needed in
 World War I. And for that he was 
rewarded with a Balfour Declaration. 
Q: Was he someone that you knew  about? 

A: No. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I know of his activities, and he was the 
first president of Israel, and very active 
in -- in the process of obtaining independ
ence from Britain. But all this personal 
connection of this Dr. Theodoro with hi
m, and now with me, indeed. So she 
guided me into microbiology. I took a lot 
of classes in it throughout the four year 
studies towards a Bachelor of Science. An
d just because I had such  choices, I took 
all sorts of classe s that  
I liked in psychology and lo
gic. French. French was 
something th at I knew well so I took classe
s in order to raise my  grade average. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
17
Indeed, it worked. But she want
ed me to work with that 
organism, but this time to 
do the opposite, inhibit its production of 
acetone and encourage its production of 
Vitamin B
2
. Very important in Asia and Europe, too. But that was for graduate 
school, later on. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Ah, in the meantime in Detroit, 
as I said, I began teaching Hebrew. 
Q: To? 
A: To various Hebrew or Jewish synagogues. 
Q: To kids? 
A: Such as Temple Beth El, a Reform 
synagogue, and Temp le
 Emmanuel, another 
Reform synagogue. Jews that wanted 
to be Jewish, you know. That was my  
greatest disappointment, that Israelis, or 
Hebrew teachers that they had, locals, 
wouldn™t -- didn™t want to teach in Refo rm synagogues. And I was so mad, I went 

to st -- teach at the Reform. And I™m glad 
to this day that a lot of kids were so 
curious about their Jewishness, and whatev 
-- in -- in -- to the degree, or to th -- 
way beyond wh at they saw in the house. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: They wanted to know mo
re, and that™s what I was teaching them. Anyway, the 
second job [indecipherable] at Temp le Em
manuel was part already of the Un ited 
Hebrew Schools. In all of Detroit th
ere were United Hebrew Schools. United 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
18
Hebrew Schools you can be a teacher 
if you attend a Hebrew academy, or 
Midrasha to get a Hebrew teacher™s cer
tificate. So you take some education 
classes at the university, and Hebrew 
classes at the Midrasha, and become a 
Hebrew teacher, a certified Hebrew teache
r. And I did that. And also within the 
United Hebrew schools, with all the Isr
aeli students that func
tioned as teachers, 
we had a group of -- a choir 
and dancers, and we would travel around all the small 
communities in Michigan, 
and perform for them. 
Q: You did, too? 

A: I did, too. 
Q: You™re a singer? 

A: A singer, a dancer, everything, like -- 

Q: Oh, mm. 
A: -- to bring so me Israeliskind they used 
to call it. In the summe
rs I used to work 
[indecipherable] I was play
ing with the idea of going back. M-My  brother -- 
Q: Let™s take a break, just a second. [t
ape break]. Okay. You were saying? Yo u 
were startin g to say someth
ing about your brother. 
A: Oh, yes. My brother was employed by
 the -- by our uncle, but it didn™t do 
much and his income
 was very limited. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did he have a family? 

A: A wife, a child. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
19
Q: Mm-hm.  
A: And I was talking about leaving, b
ecause as a foreign student you™re not 
allowed to work , and it -- if they -- if 
you get -- you come up to a B average, you 
can get a permit for 10 - 12 hours a -- a w
eek to work. So w
ith my brother, we 
discussed this -- this, and th e only arrange
ment [indecipherable] him is to go back 
to wh at he knows best, and that is to open a store, a dry goods store. 

Q: Just like in Romania. 

A: Like in Romania, and I 
can work there unofficially. 
Q: Mm, cause you were living with him the whole time? 

A: Only  the first six months, maybe. And then
 I just moved to a family that rented 

out rooms. 

Q: Mm-hm.  
A: One ro om, one. They usually
 would have one student. 
Q: Mm-hm. And did he do th
at? Did he open a store? 
A: Yes, he did that. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: He opened a store in 1953, late in 
™53. And after classes I would go to th e 
store, send him home to help in  the hous
e with the child. And that started opening 
up th-the possibility of doing something. 
Q: Where was the store? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
20
A: In Detroit. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: On Third Street. 

Q: Was it downtown? 

A: Close, not really. Close to down
town. And I worked
 very hard -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and very nice, and the main busin e
ss is on th e week end and so I could wo rk 
for 12 hours and keep  it [indecipherable] became very -- did very  well, to the 
point wh ere some years later it developed 
into a wholesale -- to a distributor -- 
distribution import and -- 
Q: Of fabric? 

A: Fabrics, shoes -- 
Q: Oh. 
A: -- and shoes. Bu t ready-ma
de pants, shirts, etcetera. 

Q: Mm. What was the name of the business? 
A: Well, he bought it from another person called Bernstein, so everybody called 
us Bernstein™s. But Henry was a very smart fellow. 

Q: That™s hi -- is that your brother? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Henry. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
21
A: Henry.  
Q: Uh-huh. So you™re in school full 
time, you™ve been en courag ed to  study 
microbiology -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- which you did. You finished in
 four years? Did you finish in -- 
A: Right, in fift -- 

Q: -- that™s pretty good.
 Working a lot, and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- teaching on the side. 
A: Oh, yes [indecipherable] 

Q: So you didn™t have a free minute? 

A: No. Really. But in
 1956 I graduated with a Bach
elor™s degree in science. And 
in ™57, I started the graduate school, w
ith this Dr. Theodoro, with th e organism 
what -- that I mentioned. No
 need to mention it again. 
And we worked on it, and I 
took a trans -- graduate classes. W e work
ed on it for six, eight months, when she 
received a Fulbright scholarship to go ba
ck to Oxford and st
udy there with Dr. 
Krebs. Weitzman was no lo nger there. Famous name, Dr. Krebs. 

Q: Krebs cycle. 

A: Krebs cycle, you heard 
of the Krebs cycle, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
22
A: I have a book from that period, Dr. 
Krebs signature. So she went away and 
turned me over to anothe
r professor, Dr. Matman. Th
is -- Dr. Theodoro was a 
physiologist of bacteria, and Dr. Matman
 was more of a clin
ical, so when she 
switched me to another thesis [indecipherabl
e] but also with a organism that is 
anaerobic, lives in the abse
nce of air. And wh at happen
ed, the same, I worked in 
the store, I taught Hebrew, and attended cl
asses. But in 1956, before she left, sh e 
made me into a laboratory assistant, a
nd Dr. Rose -- Ross -- Rosen -- Gosen, he 
liked me, he wanted me as a laborator
y assistant, but I couldn™t become an 
employee of the university without citizen
ship. And so within a few months he 
arranged my  conversion into a 
green card American citizen. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And thro ughout the graduate years, I 
was assistant in the laboratory, teaching 
the Hebrew at -- at -- evenings, working in
 the store, taking so me summer classes, 
until 1961. Oh. 

Q: Let me ask you a question about those f
our -- four years or so, four or five 
years. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Detroit was a very melting pot. People had come there from -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- all over the world. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
23
A: That™s right. 
Q: And all over the U.S.. 
A: Oh, yes. 

Q: Espe -- all over the s
outh, to work in the -- 
A: I know. 
Q: -- to work in the factories. 
A: That™s where the store 
was. All those hillbillies -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- we called them, from the south. 
Q: From the south. 

A: They -- 

Q: But also people from eastern Europe and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- it™s a very mixed population there. 

A: Correct. 
Q: Did you experience any an
ti-Semitism at that time? 
A: Not really. 
Q: No.  

A: No. No, no, no.  
Q: It was a fairly tolerant -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
24
A: I -- 
Q: -- place, did you feel, or was it because -- 
A: -- I didn™t -- 

Q: -- you were mix -- n o t mixing, or -- 

A: -- functioned in the Jewish committee, e
ith er Israeli or local Jews. My brother 
belonged to a Hooc iv ri, a Hebrew spea
king group. They would meet once a 
month and have lectures in
 Hebrew and those were European  that came, plus 
American scholars, rabbis, etcetera. I ha
ven™t experienced any anti-Semitism. I-In 
school all the students and teachers were 
as nice and friendly and cooperative as 
possible. 

Q: So you felt that th -- all the opportu
nities of any American were available to 
you as well at that time? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you knew other 
people who wa -- were survivor
s, I would take it, because 
you did exist in this community
, and you knew other survivors. 
A: It™s amazing that -- how everybody 
lock ed up like a clam, and nobody spoke 
anything. On ly now do I realize two brot
her from Polish origin
, th ey  stu d i ed  at 
Wayne State University. They live here 
now. They  went through real difficult 
times. They -- in Poland they
 realized all their dif -- wh
at goes on there. So they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
25
ran away and lived in the w
oods with other partisans for months, for years. Right 
in the middle of German occupati
on. But we never talked  about it. 
Q: Mm. There mu st have been a lo t of pe
ople in Detroit with stories like that. 
A: Like that, yes. 

Q: People didn™t -- they just -- 
why didn™t they talk about it? 
A: I couldn™t tell you. To th is day, I never talked ab out it, I never asked an yone to 

listen to -- to what happen
ed . Just keep on going and ad vance. Forg et the past. 
Some from Budapest that went through 
their difficulties, but Poland mostly was 
the most dangerous place that they came out
 alive. Still, we di
dn™t talk about.  
Q: Hm. 

A: Until now. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Like my wife said, I -- we -- we di
dn™t consider ourselv es any surv ival -- 
survivors of the Holo caust. And knoc
k on wood, due to my father™s 
administration, we came out, the whole family, intact.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Difficulties, dangerous c
onditions, but we came out. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But you were also
 -- you were in a position to  understand 

what other people had been through, and to  know --  
A: Of course, of course -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
26
Q: -- to know th-the dire 
sit-situation that they had 
come from, how difficult life 
was for them in the United States, too. 
A: Oh. 

Q: So it™s some un -- it™s interesting that 
people didn™t want to 
talk at that time. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But I guess understandable too. Just want
ed to move ahead. They  were young -
- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and just looking at the future, and -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- struggling to get ahead. 

A: Almo st embarrassed of -- of telling 
it, what happened, and it™s a Hebrew 
saying, we heard about you, we heard abou
t you. When someone tries to tell of his 
past, th-the -- the -- the company would -- 
would ridicule you. Oh , we heard ab out 

your sufferings, we heard ab
out your problems. In othe
r words, don™t tell us an y 
of that. 

Q: But you didn™t ac-actually 
experience that, you just sort
 of assumed that that™s 
what people were thinking, right? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. American Jews, mostly. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
27
A: American Jews. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: Yes. 

Q: Did -- did you have any experien ces 
with American Jews
, encounters with 
people that tal -- that revealed to you 
how little they knew about what had gone on 
in Europe, or how much th
ey knew? Did you have a sense of how -- whether or 
not people were well informed
 about what had happened? 
A: American Jews -- the community in 
Detroit for instance, shook off their 
responsib ility. Whatever needed to  be do
ne was supposed to be done in New 
York . And indeed th ere was a strong or
ganization in New York, the American 
Jewish Commit tee an d the World Jewish 
Congress and -- and the -- some other 

organizations that were suppos
ed to protest and th ey did. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I realize it now in the -- that the arch
ives, what I translat
e, what they did, 
specifically  for Romania -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- which I translate, and I realize that
 they were all active and influential. 
Actually they -- they travel
ed to Ro mania. Rabbi Wei
ss traveled to Romania in 
™42 and ™4 3, when th ings were really bad th ere and confronted  the leadership in 
Romania. But it didn™t help, I mean -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
28
Q: No. 
A: Hitler went on burning Jews.  
Q: But in Detroit you don™t 
think that there was much -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- activity along those lines. 
A: I didn™t see anything, even though th
ere were a few famous Jews that could 
have or should have done
 things. They  had their own problems, probably  in 
Detroit. You may have heard of Father
 Kaufman and Henry Fo rd  and all their 
venom that they sp
ewed out on Jews. 
Q: Father Kaufman was a -- a radio -- 
A: Ah, yes. 

Q: -- he was -- he had a radio program that was heard all over the country, I think. 
A: Right. 
Q: And he was giving serm
ons that were very -- 
A: Oh -- 
Q: -- very right wing, was wh
at we would call it today. 
A: Very anti-Semitic. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
29
A: For revenge we used to 
go to his church on Christ
mas night. If there were no 
places to s -- to sit, we would stand in
 the back and he wa
s informed of our 
presence. Just -- but this was in 1953. 
Q: When  you were a college student. 

A: So he himself temp ered do
wn already, at that time. 
Q: Hm. 
A: ™52 or ™53 and ™54, two tim
es we went to that church. 
Q: Hm. So you™re -- we™re -- 
we -- you brought us all the way up to th e late 50™s, 
you™re graduating. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Contemplating -- a-and yo
u™re in graduate school. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you™re a lab assistant. 
A: Correct.  

Q: And wha -- where are we going fro
m here? You™re still in Detroit. 
A: I was still in Detroit. I wanted to s
ee the country  here. So the su mmer of ™61, 
with another friend, we took -- we drov
e around 10 weeks. We drove around the 
United States, and stopped in a
ll the parks in all the cities. 
Q: Was that the first time 
you had traveled in the U.S.? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
30
A: Well, during school years we would co
me for New Years to New York , drive -
- driving a full car. That™s about all. 
Maybe we went to Chicago once for a 
wedding, one of our Israeli students [i
ndecipherable] ma ybe th -- Jankela. Bu t 
otherwise, we didn™t know the country  and 
we had to really t-t-to integrate here, 
we need to travel around and see the whol
e place. Fascin ating what America did. 
In 1961 or ™62, the Univers
ity of Arizona at Tucson, in 
their catalog suggested that 
either they have it, or they™re going to 
open  a faculty microbiology of arid lands. 
Very good for Israel, v ery good for sout
h amer -- South America and ourselves. 
And that caught my  attention. A friend of
 mine working at the U.N. suggested 
with my ability of languages and this kind
 of microbiology coul
d really pick me 
up, bring me up. So  I -- I applied there, 
I went there to find 
out that they don™t 
have it yet, they want to develop it, and 
I could help th em, be part of it. I didn™t 
like it, but I was there already so I stay
ed for a year, and that™s where I -- 
Q: And you were teaching? 
A: -- accepted that position of Hebrew teacher. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Director of -- they never had anything 
and there were a lot of New York Jews 
coming to live in Tucson, Ariz
ona because of their children --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Haim Solomon.
 This is tape number two, 
side A. We may have lost 
a few seconds off the end of the last 
tape. You™re in Tucson, Arizona now. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you™ve gone there and you™re going
 to help them start up this graduate 
program in microbiology, and you menti
oned that there were many Jews there 
from New York , people who had come -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- in some cases because their children -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- had asthma, and -- 
A: That™s why they came, that w as the pl
ace where it™s so dry th at the kids grew  
up very comfortably.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: But they needed some sort of Jewish
 education and I arrived there and they  
were very happy to bring th em togethe
r. We had ab out 30 kids, and we would 
meet on Saturday and Sunday at a Kiwanis 
Club. There were very young kids that 
needed elementary Hebrew, 
but there were a few that 
needed preparation for Bar 
Mitzvah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
32
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And so that -- those were my duties with this school. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I enjoyed it, I liked it, it gave me
 a sense of doing something in addition, 
cause with the schooling I didn™t see anythi
ng ready for me to proceed. So I took 
various classes in microbiology, chemistry, 
or whatever could be
 helpful for -- for 
the Ph.D. program. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And at the end of the year I -- oh, I st
arted that in September ™62 and by June I 
-- it -- September, but later on, for Pass
over, we drove back to Detroit from 
Tucson, two students from New Yo rk picked  me up -- too -- dropped me in 
Detroit and they proceeded on. And while
 in Detroit for Passover vacation, or 
Easter vacation, I approached the Un
iversity of Michi -- Michigan State 
University and explained to them why I d
on™t like it there, and what I™m willin g to 
-- able to do, and certainly fo
r the fall of that year, ™63,
 I would be accepted for -- 
at their university as a graduate student. 
And s -- exce -- I did 
exactly that. When 
the school year ended in June in Tucson, Arizona, I so
ld the car, packed up and 
came back to Detroit by train. Made -- 
started arrangements with -- at Michigan 
State University. Found a prof
essor that thought I could help him with some of his 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
33
projects, and so I started with th e pr
ogram towards a doctorate de-degree at 
Michigan State University. 
Q: In Lansing. 

A: In Lansing, East Lansing. 

Q: Mm-hm.  
A: Very interesting work. Now I started wo
rking with this Clos
tridium that I was 
familiar with, but this time with Clostr
idium botulinum. Fam
ous bacterium that 
causes botulism --  

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- when consumed with canned foods
 or other foods. The question was -- 
Michigan  was basically a dairy college or
 university and the question was whether 

this Clostridium botulinum would grow 
in milk. But the Clostridia have two 
kinds, one that spoils the 
milk and one that doesn™t s
poil the milk, but they both 
produce a highly potent toxin. So  my  proj
ect was to work  w
ith the Clostridium 
botulinum type E, the one 
that does not curd the m
ilk, and see whether it will 
grow at the refrigeration temp erature, and 
-- before spoiling the milk. So we did a 

lot of wo rk on th at when  suddenly s -- al
l around th e Great Lakes, a large die off 

of seagulls were washed off o -- on the 
shore. And all over Michigan there were 
smokers that smoked fish and sold  them ope
n on the roadside in stores. But when 
the plastic -- plastics came out, they star
ted packing these smoked fish in plastics, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
34
under vacuum, and that™s exact th e cond
itions that promote growth of this 
bacterium -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- to the point wh ere it produces toxin, a
nd if it™s that type th
at doesn™t spoil the 
milk, it does not show any decomposition. 
So people would eat 
and become sick 
and die. There were quite a few deaths in
 Michigan due to th
ese smoked fish pla -- 
packed  in plastic bags. One particular case
 of three ladies having brunch together 
where they ate some su ch fish or tuna. 
And the next day two of them were dead. 
One was dead immediately, one died in th
e hospital, a third one survived. And the 
-- the FDA in Detroit was in ch
arge of this case. But this
 was already late, in 1965, 
™64, that two ladies died, one survived, 
and FDA in Detroit is investigating this 
case. Investigating means first thing go to
 their house and see what else there is 
there. They found a lot of cans and a lot 
of products that all 
had these toxin. Now 
the people in Detroit and the FDA didn™t 
have any idea of ho
w or what to do. 
They  went to Wayne State University, a
nd at Wayne they  told th em, look, we 
have a -- we had a person qualified to talk to
 you, but he is now at Michigan  State 
doing -- working exactly on the same general 
situation. So they came to Michigan 
State and there I showed them how to do, what to do, etcetera, etcetera, until my 

professor walks out of the laboratory and th
ey said to me [indecipherable] person, 
he says Haim, you have to come and work
 for us. Forg et this classes here, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
35
come to us. And he kept coming ev ery 
other week, every week an d asking me, 
just don™t -- why won™t you come down  to 
Detroit, see w h at we are talking about. 
So I did, after I talked to some other pr
ofessors. And there he tells me, and I tell 
him what to do, he tells me what needs to
 be done. But when all is -- this is over, 
we need to  do so me other work  with E. coli and salmonella and all such cases. 
And I say no, not for me. I™m 
strictly working with this
 Clostridium botulinum. So 
he calls up Washington and th
e division director asks him 
to talk -- to give me the 
phone to talk, and he talks to me abou
t -- first he asks me  are you married? No. 
Perfect. Smart [indecipherable] whatever he
 said. But he started enumerating the 
things that they want to 
do here. And th ey have -- ju
st starting to organize one 
laboratory with -- and they have one 
person already from [indecipherable] 
Dietrich who worked on this 
and they are looking all ove
r the country. So, really, 
they made me such offers I couldn™t 
refuse. Early in 1965, we -- I -- w-we 
arranged a meeting in New Jersey, a conve
ntion. And there I me t with them and 
again, they emphasized all 
the possibilities, you know, th
e activities, and what we 
can do and what we need to
 do, etcetera, etcetera. And there I was fresh with this 
experience from Detroit and at Michigan. 
And -- and th ey thought I™m gonna open 
up the place for them. We started investigatin
g, first of all the smoke-fish industry, 
which was completely closed down, FD
A came out with a clear arrangement, 
every one of these small places th at smoke
 fish, just by touching, and ba -- just 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
36
estimating. Some arrangements were made 
with the banks, or with the department 
HHS, or -- for them to be compensated 
or bought out, and only a few large 
companies in Chicago and Ne
w York were allowed to 
take all these little places 
and develop a program that will assure a 
safe product. Ther
e was one incident, 
horrible incident. This smoked fish was tr
 -- sent out from Michigan to Kroger 
stores in the south, Tennessee, Arkansas
. And the truck driver started out in 
Michigan, that sudden
ly the refrigeration broke down. 
When he realized it, it was 
already 10 - 12 hours, but he
 pulled into a garage and th
ey  started fixing it. Fixing 
it, cooled up the -- cooled off th-the tr
uck and the products, and -- and proceeded 
to deliver the product cold, refrigerated,
 as though nothing ha
ppened. And the six 
or eight people that bought these fish, died. 
A lot of Jews. It was a Je wish tasting -
- 
Q: Smoked fish. 
A: -- product, smoked fish. 

Q: Uh-huh. Huh. 
A: They were beautifully yellow-bronze 
colo red, and th ey  were intact, now 
cooled, an d you buy them, you eat them, and -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Levys, and Cohens and 
five, six people died. And ot
hers were affected, but 
survived. And so  I™m now an employee at
 the Food and Drug Administration. I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
37
came in 1965, the FDA was still located in
 the Department of Agriculture, the 
south building. Soon en ough 
we moved in to a new building on 200 C Street, 
southwest. It™s still in the 60™s and we are 
still involved with a
ll sorts of outbreaks 
due to seafood pro
ducts. [tape break] 
Q: So you were able to do
 -- you were able to really
 do something important with 
your education, very  [indecipherab le] wh
en you came to Washington, there was a 
great need for -- 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: -- for what you had studied. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So you mu st have 
felt gratified  by that. 
A: Right. 
Q: Did you have thoughts during th ese 
years that you were sorry you hadn™t 
studied to be an M.D.? 
A: No. 
Q: It went out of your mind. 
A: No, no. 

Q: Good. 

A: No, because bacteriology 
became more meaningful, 
and the situation in the 
American food industry wa
s such that many, many of 
the food establishments 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
38
were functioning at a level very deleteri
ous, or very inferior, or very business-
oriented, but v-ver -- no regard to safety
, and food safety. And all throughout the 
60™s, they improved -- it™s called shelf life -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- of products that normally would 
decompose. Their main
 interest was to 
extend sh elf life, extend prof
its and let -- let the consumer worry about safety. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So that in the 60™s, really, we clean -- cleared out the fish
 industry, both the 
smoked fish, the prepared fish, even craw
fish. Brought about rules and regulations 
that only the -- only the establish ments 
that followed, and considered safety 
survived, or were allowed to continue, 
and all the others were restricted, and 
punished  and fo rced out of their functio
ns -- of their business. [interruption] 
Q: I™d like to ask you, it™s the mid-60™s 
and you are -- now have been  in the 
United States 13 years, you came in ™52. 
And your parents and sisters and -- are in 
Israel. 
A: Right. 
Q: Ar-Are you in touch with th em the whole time, and -- and -- and how are their 

lives going and have you any 
regret about not being in  
Israel, or are you content 
that you™ve come to the 
U.S. at -- at this point? 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
39
Q: Yeah. 
A: Content? While during the school years 
I was not so much in
 touch with them 
all, not corresponding suffici
ently. Now th at I was at wo
rk and I had even ings, so 
a normal life, more or less. I was in touch 
with them, I started 
visiting th em almo st 
every summer.  

Q: Starting when ? 
A: In ™65.  

Q: You went to Israel? 
A: After I finished school I went to 
Israel and then came to FDA in Ju ly. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yes, in the meantime, they have reached better conditions and we 

corresponded; likewise my brother in Detro
it advanced  very nicely. So, in ™57 we 
brought our parents over here for five, 
six months. And in the meantime I would 
go there almost every summer. In  addition to
 work h-here in FDA in the 60™s, I 
became very involved in Jewish
 organizations. As I did in Detroit, I tried to teach 
Hebrew at the Jewish center, here in 
Washington, and to adults, conversational 
Hebrew. But the Jewish center was still on 16
th
 Street, w e -- we advertised it an d 
we had six priests s-signing up for it, a
nd three Jewish students. So, after one 
encounter of a short period, we stopped it.
 In the meantime I be
came active in the 
Jewish Community Co uncil™s single adult group called The Co ffeeh ouse. I

became the chairman of 
The Coffeehouse and orga
nized the well-attended 
meetings every Thursday night. We o
ffered the -- we offered a good sp eaker, 
usually a ambassador. And danish and coffe
e and a place to meet young, Jewish 
people. 

Q: And -- and did you 
feel that that was productive 
for those young people, did -- 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Because from there, as I indicated he
re, a lot of these Jewish youngsters, 
adults, singles, became more involved in
 Jewish affairs and later on when  we 
organized the Washington committee for 
Soviet Jewry, they became active. 
United Jewish Appeal, they 
became active, and all sorts of other organizations. 
Q: Was your intention when you starte
d this Coffeehouse a political one, or a 
social one, or -- 

A: Social. 

Q: Social. 
A: Mostly so cial. We had four or five couples that got married -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- coming out of The Coffeehouse. 

Q: So it was for fellowship and -- and just 
for people to meet each other, and -- 
A: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
41
Q: -- and -- and -- but then, political
 organization grew out of that. 
A: Yes.  
Q: For you, and -- but had 
you been active politically be
fore that? I know you had 
-- you™d been teaching Hebrew to
 kids, so you had social --  
A: Yes. 
Q: -- activities, but -- 
A: I joined the Zionist Organization of Am
erica. I was active at the Hillel, at th e 

B™nai B™rith, delegate to the Hillel or
ganization at the George Wash ington 
University from B™nai B™rith. ZOA, uni 
-- Jewish National Fund, anything that 
needed a voice, or action. 
Q: Mm-hm. And that was mo stly when  you came to Washington. 

A: After I came to Washington. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Yes, in Washing -- 

Q: What was it that -- why do you think 
you turned a corner 
there, and what -- 
what do you think -- was 
there something going on in 
the world that politicized 
you, or do you think it was just an outgr
owth of all of your experiences, and 

knowledge, and -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
42
A: Well, again t -- these organizations we
re slow in  -- in developing and needed 
more members and more actions and more 
activities. A nd I had a regular job and a 
lot of extra time. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh at about a girlfriend, did you have a -- 

A: Girlfriends. In Washington, some. When I 
left Israel my older sister gave birth 
to a little d aughter, and those were still 
the days, 1952, when going to America 
meant being lost to the fa
mily. So she asked me when
 are we going to see you? 
And I said, I™ll come to  her wedding. The 
baby. So even though I went there every 
-- almost every summer, I just
 went to the wedding, and there I met my  wife, at 
the wedding.  

Q: Oh, in Israel. 

A: 1971. 
Q: Mm-hm. And she was a citizen, Israeli citizen there? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She graduated and work ed in  a hospita
l, op -- in that -- in
 Jaffa. Forget the 
name of that -- Jaffa Hospital. 
Q: And she was a Romanian. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
43
A: She was related to the groom at the wedding. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: So that was my reward. 

Q: For all your 20 years of -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- lonely hard work, yeah. And -- 
and wh en  did she come, when did you 
marry? How long after you met? 
A: 1971. 
Q: You met.  
A: Yes. We met at -- I was there, she came
 here for a visit and then I went, and we 
got married in October 21
st
, and I returned and she need ed about a month to make 
arrangements for her coming.  
Q: On th e record, why don™t you say her name? 
A: Mulv a. 

Q: What was her maid en name? 
A: Mulva Isaac. 
Q: Mm-hm.  

A: It was ™71, in ™73 her parents came 
here, because our older son was born, and 
we needed  help. We didn™t ha
ve much family here, so he
r mother was able to help 
out. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
44
Q: So you went from living 
alone to having a family. 
A: Oh, yeah. 
Q: Extended family. 

A: Yes. 

Q: In just a matter of a few years. 
A: Right. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, and a son. 
Q: And a son.  
A: All the re -- in-laws stayed with us 
for six months, and then th ey moved out. 
What else could we discuss? 

Q: Let me ask you about the -- the situati
on -- larger situ ation in Washington, and 
also Detroit, they were very segregated  places. Civil Rights movement, I™m sure 

that you were aware of things that were 
going on in  this country in  the south, and -
- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and in places like Detroit and Chic
ago and New York, Boston. What kinds 
of attitudes did you have ab
out what was happening in this country  at that time 
and did -- do you think that your having -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
45
A: Yes, good question, because among th e 
Jewish students in Detroit -- American 
Jewish students that I a ssociated with, so me of them were very involved in labor 
unions. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Although they studied co
mpletely different areas. 
Q: Excuse me, I™m going to  ha
ve to turn the tape over. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Haim Solomon.
 This is tape number two, 
side B. The students were 
active in labor organizations. 

A: Yes, some of these  Jewish students we
re active in labor movements, for t -- 
plans and other plans. And I liked their activ
ities, and I used to go with them. But 

then we -- at the university we had the ad
visor for foreign students, and he called 
me in one day and explained that I cannot
 get involved with these organizations 
that are considered left wi
ng, and I should stay away. 
Q: This was in the 50™s? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. Hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
46
A: And I did. We parted  comp any, and I 
avoided all of those meetings and all of 
those students, and they  were both Zionists
, and were part of our meetings at th-
the Zionist house, but on th e other hand, th
ey  supported and lectured to these labor 
unions and encouraged them to 
take stands on their pos -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- fights with them. 
Q: Was this a-advisor concerned fo r your
 citizenship, that -- that getting involved 
in these political activities could -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- could endanger your -- 

A: Jeopardize, yes.  

Q: -- your citizenship status? 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But -- 
Q: And ha -- and ha -- was that indeed 
happen ing to some foreign students in 
Detroit that you knew of? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: I didn™t know many, or -- or any that would be attracted to this.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
47
Q: So, but th en your -- you became 
a citizen, and you were a government 
employee. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And in the late 60™s, leading up to 1968
 when there were ri
ots in Washington, I 
imagine there was some tension here that
 you mu st have been aware of, racial 
tension? 
A: Yes. I lived in southwest Washington
, 240 M Street, southwest during th e riots 
and if you™re familiar with the ar
ea, right across from Arena Stage -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- is a ch urch, and the pastor -- we would -- we made arrangements with that 

church , with the pastor, that Friday night
 we used to remove the cross and put a 
Torah, and have services Friday night 
and Saturday  mo rning. So , by -- during 
these riots, the pas -- right across from wh
ere I lived were black -- Afro-American 
living in  all these new, little houses. And 
behind us were thos
e high-rises where 
mo stly black people lived. And he asked us
 to [indecipherable
] and join him in 
collecting food and taking to these citizens there, black people, because the 

Safeway, that was burned or broken in
to, and there was no way they could buy 
food, these black families. 

Q: In the neighborhood. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
48
A: In the neighborhood. So we collect
ed canned goods, and oh -- we tried to 
deliver them, but the youngsters were very
 aggressive and verbally assaulted us, 
until their mothers came and silenced them. So that™s wh
at I experienced in the 
late 60™s -- ™67 - ™68.  
Q: Mm-hm. During the riots, was there any 
looting, or ra -- or 
rioting going on in 
the -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- where you lived, in southwest? 
A: Yes, the Safeway and th e People™s Drug -- 
Q: Oh, you mentioned that, yeah. 

A: -- were broken in. 

Q: Uh-huh. Do you rememb er that, 
those nights wh en th at happened? 
A: I didn™t see it, but the next
 day this was common knowledge. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: This I remember, th at we collected 
cans, canned goods and tried to go and 
deliver for the people, and we had problems.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. In the early 
70™s now, you™re -- ™71 - ™72,
 you™re married, and -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- your wife was from Romania? 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
49
Q: And you had some common background th
ere. She™s younger than you, I think, 
a little bit. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Maybe 10 years or so? 

A: Yes. 
Q: And -- but she probably rememb ers qu
ite a bit of -- from the war years. 
A: The war years -- 
Q: Not so much? 
A: Not too mu ch. Sh e was a five year old -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- six year old child. Her father was take
n to Transn istria. She grew up with her 
mother. Indeed, when he
 finally came back, she didn™t know him -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- didn™t recognize him.  

Q: Mm-hm. And as a couple did you, th
e tw o of you, know other people who 
were either Romanians, or Holocaust su
rvivors, or did you so cialize, or -- 
A: No, but we s -- we had the -- I -- 

Q: -- get together with other peop
le who had similar backgrounds? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
50
A: I mentioned the so uthwest church, and 
all the people who lived in these high-
rises were part of that gr
oup that met Friday night -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- and Saturday morning at this church
. So  we became a group that would meet 
every other Friday, or once a mo nth 
at the various member™s houses. 
Q: Mm-hm. For socializing?  

A: Both . Services, discussion and socializing. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. What kind 
of discussions were they? 
A: One of our memb ers, a lawyer, attende
d yeshiva, so she functioned like a rabbi, 
and we discussed the weekly portions and 
-- of the Torah. And th at group stayed 
alive for -- for a long, lo
ng time, until recently, wh
en it started dying out. 
Q: Only recently? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And did you all do that because ther
e was no organized co
ngregation in your 
neighborhood -- 
A: Correct. 
Q: -- and you didn™t want to trav
el to some other neighborhood? 
A: No. That -- that™s right. 

Q: Or other parts of town? 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
51
Q: But there were other congregations
 around Washington at that time.  
A: There were, but really very few othe
r Israel -- Reform Temple, a few known 
synagogues on 16
th
 Street. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Beth Sholom. And this was a nice arra
ngement at the church  and at houses. We 
used to have a rabbi come and visit 
us. And then sometimes we organized a 
common services with the c
hurch  people. That was on 
G Street, there™s another 
church that we met.  
Q: Mm-hm. And those people, I would th
ink those -- that group of people were 
good friends -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- then, because you met fo
r so long, so many years -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- every week. 

A: Every other week. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: We met. 

Q: Yeah. Tell me about your activities w
ith the Washington committee for Soviet 

Jewry. This was in the mid-six -- mid-70™s? 
A: Early 70™s. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
52
Q: Early 70™s. 
A: Very early 1968 - ™69, that friend of
 mine, Moshe Brodetsky and my self started 
talking about doing something about So
viet Jewry because the j -- Jewish 
community, the organized Jewish community didn™t want to touch it. 
Q: Hm. Really? 
A: Jewish Community  Co uncil, not the 
center, Jewish Community  Co uncil, and 
that™s where I met these youn
g kids from New York  that 
were equally inclined to 
do so mething, and we started the organi
zation with a membership and newsletter, 
and -- and we found out that there are su
ch organizations in 
other cities, and -- 
[interruption] 
Q: And you said you had a newsletter, a
nd you had regular meetings, and wa -- 
and what kind of things did you do? 
A: Yes, we a newsletter that was nationwide, because there was a similar 
organization in Cincinnati and 
one in California, in Los Angeles, one in Florida. 
And so we had the newslette
r that came out once a mo nth. We had meetings. We 
would go out to talk to other groups, 
because the Jewish Co
mmunity Council felt 
that we are interfering with their leadership
, and we didn™t, we weren™t, we just -- 
eventually we made arrangements with 
the labor union right across the -- the 
Soviet embassy on 16
th
 Street, where we organized a daily vigil, which the police 
told us we™re not supposed to have 
any signs, or any sp eeches, or any 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
53
pronunciations, but it™s okay for us to sta
nd there. And every day at 12:30 to  one, 
we would assemb le there in front of th
e building, across from the Soviet embassy 
and just stand there for half an hour, ma
ybe read some passage [indecipherable]. 
In fact, w-we had the pastor from the -- the big church on 16
th
 Street in -- in 
Massachusetts -- was it 14
th
 str -- John Steinberg -- Steinbrook. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: On th e Jewish holidays he would take
 10 of his people, and man the vigil. 

Protest marches we could not
 have five hu -- we needed
 to observe the 500 feet 
rule, so we would meet on K St
reet, with posters -- K and 16
th
 and march around 
with posters, accusing the Soviets of oppressing the Jewish community there. 

Q: And what was going on at this time, wa
s that the sa -- the Soviet government 
was not allowing Jews to leave? 
A: No. 
Q: An-And -- and was it that general situatio
n that you were i-in opposition to , or 
were there specific cases that you were -- 
A: Well, in the meantime, the arrested all 
th e -- the activists that -- all those who 
applied for exit and were refused, so 
we had the list of refuseniks, and we 
produced bracelets with their names, and so
me sort of hanging with their names, 
and we went to various synagogues and as
ked them adopt one of these refuseniks 
and co m -- and co rrespond with  them, a
nd send th em help. In the meantime, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
54
people would travel to visit Russia and 
meet with these refuseniks. The famous 
[indecipherable] Sharansky, sh
e used to come here, and we
 took her to the various 
senators, congressmen. The famous Jacks
on amendment came out of our activities 
and our in fluence with  Senator Jackson, of
 Washington, and his assistant, Richard 
Perle, who wrote the Jackson amendm
ent, Jackson-Vanik, wh ich made 
commercial relations with Russia related to
 their -- to their treatment of Jews 
aspiring to emigrate, the Jewish emigration 
from Russia to Israel, o r to here, or to 
Europe.  
Q: And were you specifically involved in
 th e writing of that legislation, or 
consulting, or did -- 
A: No. No, no, no.  

Q: -- you [indecipherable] the hill? 
A: But it -- Moshe Brod
etsky was advising -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- what conditions that they have
 in Russia that -- that Jackson -- 
Q: Did -- did people from the Washington committee go to Russia? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Maybe just individuals that 
were just the paying memb ers. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
55
A: I know of a few that visited there 
and made contact with these refuseniks. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Who were now fired from their go
vernment jobs, and under -- under 
observance from all the KGB, and they were 
helped materially with money to just 
sur -- survive. And their names w ere sp
ecifically submitted to the Russians to 
allow them to -- whoever was president he
re, had these names ready to negotiate 

further.  

Q: Mm-hm. And that worked continued 
for how long? Up un
til -- how long did 
that go on, the work , 
what you were doing? 
A: All of the 70™s, the struggle went on
. I™m not sure exactly when  the Ru ssians 
finally opened the gates and 
they -- first they asked for payment for the education 
that these Jews received before exiting or
 leaving Russia and all the advantages 
they had enjoyed there. But eventually th
ey opened the gates, and a large -- a large 
number of immigrants started out from 
Russia to Israel, 
and Germany, and 
Romania and Poland. They  just went out. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. In the late 70™s, I 
think it was 1979 specifically, there was a 
television program that aired in this country  on ABC about the Ho locaust, and a 
lot of people point to  that nationwide viewing of that program as sort of a -- a 

beginning of -- of th -- of public educatio
n in this country about the Holocaust. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
56
And a lot of people started speaking out ab
out their experience in -- in the late 
70™s and early 80™s.  
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: It -- it w as a -- sort of a flowering 
of knowledge, and -- and dissemination and 
lot of young people started observing Ho
locaust Remembrance 
Day around this 
time. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And I™m just wondering, you know, what kind of a -- how did you -- what were 
you doing in  those years a
nd -- and did -- and -- and did you start speaking out 
about the -- about your experiences, or -- 
or about other people™s experiences and 
getting in volved  somehow in -- in educ
ating people about the Holocaust?  
A: Not yet. Not in the 80™s. But lik
e Detroit, Washington had a Jewish 
Community Council, in
volved with Jewish affairs, 
and we in the committee were 
forcing them to pick up more topics, a
nd mo re projects, and mo re involvement. 
So, wh en  Yo m HaShoah and the other such 
anniversaries occurred, of course we 
were there and we were approving and 
supporting these renewal of activities.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. You -- in the 
80™s then, you had young children. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And how did you a
nd your wife d-decide to tell 
them about the 
Holocaust, or 
what kind of education did they  re
ceive in those years, or when -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
57
A: Well -- 
Q: -- and -- and how did you 
approach that question? 
A: -- first o f all, from babyhood, we 
placed them in Jewish schools. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s wait a second. [tape break] 
A: -- preschoolers. 
Q: Okay . 
A: They attended kindergarten at [indeciph
erable] up to age of five, and at that 

age they started Jewish Day School, Char
les C. Smith Jewish Day School, for 12 
years, up to graduation.  

Q: Mm. 

A: And that™s where th -- they invited 
me to speak about -- for -- around Passover 
time, where every Jew is supposed to expe
rience that -- th e Exodus, so this was 
my  story of the Exodus. What else? 

Q: Was that the first time 
you had spoken publicly about 
your experience in -- in 
front of a group, and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: It was? 

A: Oh, before that, for the Soviet Jewr
y activities, I worked 
the -- I talked to 
Hadassah group to s-si -- my  own 
group that would meet Fridays. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
58
A: Get them involved. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And oh, wherever I was, 
at a coffeehouse, at a -- oh, maybe that™s an aspect 
that needs to be covered -- 

Q: Okay . 
A: -- because when we started the So
viet Jewry activities and the Jewish 
Community  Co uncil was adam
antly against us, we are disturbing th e -- we voted 
ourselves into that Jewish
 Co mmunity Council, and there were plenty of other 
memb ers that sided with us, and we were
 able to bring about, by demo cratic 
voting, activities that we wanted the Counc
il to do, and indeed they did. And they 
approached this Soviet Jewry activities a
nd protest as a community -- experience 
in community involv
ement. From Orthodox to  Refo
rm, we had more help from 
the Reform synagogues than from the othe
rs, and financially they said anything 

you need, we can help you
. We needed to -- mail
ings and rallies and su ch 
organizations that needed money and 
they  supplied us very nicely. The 
Washington Hebrew congregation specifically
 gave us money and 
told us clearly, 
whatever you need, you tell 
us. I was already prepared 
and understood that th -- 
this Reform moveme nt in this city, or 
in this country , and I knew that they are 
with us, just as in Detr
oit, I was with them.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
59
A: And they  are looking fo r causes -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- to get involved in. 

Q: Just as they were looking to  educate their -- 

A: Pardon? 
Q: Just as wa -- you found in Detroit, 
that they were eager to educate their 
children. 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: And -- 
A: In fact, when I came to Washington, I 
taught at the Temp le Sinai for one year. 
It was late for them to prorate me into 
the Hebrew curricu lum, but I taught history 
and [indecipherable] Bible. Prophets, specif
ically. Presently I™m ba -- the treasurer 
of an Orthodox congregation on 16
th
 Street. But I feel fine in any denomination. 
Anyone that wants to be Jewish, and wants 
to experience Jewishness, is fine with 
me. 
Q: And are you still s-speaking publicly wh
en you™re asked to do so, about your 
personal experiences? Do yo
u do that very often? 
A: No. 
Q: No. But you do volunt
eer at the museum. 
A: Yes.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
60
Q: And -- and tell me about that. Tell me 
why you want to do that, and wh at it is 
that you™re doing. 
A: Maybe you know mo r -- Marty Go ldman,
 he is in charge of the Holo caust 
Surv ivors. 

Q: It™s an organization at the museum. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And way back  when I was the chairm
an of The Coffeehouse, Marty met his 
wife there, and -- but before that he also
 became interested and involved -- in fact, 
at some point, when  I could no longer do 
that, he took over 
the chairmanship of 
The Coffeehouse. And with him I would e-ex
plain and talk about my  experiences. 
So when he became th
e chairman of the Holocaust Su
rvivors, he -- every time we 
had a meeting -- chan ce to meet, he would 
explain to me that 
I need to join his 
group as a survivor. Like my wife said
 I didn™t feel like I went through the 
Holocaust horrors, cause with 
all the difficulties, our fath
er c -- walked us through 
the Holocaust in safety. So I kept telling 
him that, presently I™m with the FDA and 
when I retire, I™m co
mi ng to  volunteer there. And he
kept after me, andhe was 
aware of my interviews, and of the Sh
oah Foundation interview. And befo re I 
retired, I called him and I --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Haim Solom
on. This is tape number th
ree, side A. When you 
finally y -- did retire -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- you kept in touch with Marty -- 
A: Yes, I arranged to visit -- 

Q: Gold man. 
A: -- him on January the fifth, I retired on 
January the third. During that week, I 
guess, I me t with Marty. He took me over to  the library and the archives and made 
them an offer, he said, th
ey can™t refuse; a Romani
an speaking volunteer. And 
sure enough, Henry Mayer, in charge of th e archives explained 
to me that they 
have a large volume of Romanian documents, 
tapes, that need translation and they 
don™t have any translator. So
 we started out with a shor
t project of five tapes and 
another one, six - seven tapes and now I™m in a project of 1944 - ™45 already, 17 
tapes in that series that 
need translation. In the m
eantime they -- they send me 12 
depositions of the Gypsies in Romania that  were transported to Transnistria, an d 
now they are about to receive German co
mpensation. So they 
picked th-the 12 
mo st violent ones that I translated and they
 are very, very  happy, or so -- satisfied 
with that [indecipherable] I 
arranged that in a way that 
the importance is stressed. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
62
Q: What do you mean? 
A: I mean, they picked only 
the most egregious cases.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Where Gypsies lived -- 
they™re either traveling 
from place to place -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- or they settled in one place in housi
ngs, but to get them out, th-the Romanian 
Nazis burned their villages. And they cam
e out and they tran
sported them to 
Transnistria. 

Q: Mm. So you™re translating depositions
 from these people that were done wh en? 
When were these interviews 
with these people taken?  
A: They were done in Romania. 
Q: When ? 
A: 2000. Ni -- 
Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah.  
Q: Hm. 
A: 2000 - 2001. But they pi
cked the 12 most grave -- gr
av -- and I translated them 
in a way that they could see ex
actly what they did to them.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And what does it m
ean to you to be doing this volunteer 
work ? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
63
A: It™s very rewarding in the sense that 
it will become available 
in English. Not in 
detail, but only in titles, or summaries of
 the Jewish suffering in Romania during 
the war. The -- th-the -- the secrets or th-t
he -- the way th ey -- they  brought about 
the loss of 400,000 Jews in Ro mania durin g 
these years, every new laws that they 
could use to -- to obstruct and to  prev
ent Jews from just li
ving normal lives. 
Professionals expelled from their professi
ons, assets were nationalized, or -- as 
they called it. Romanians were allowed to
 buy Jewish properties for very minimal 
prices, then rent them out to the Jews. Ev
en some that didn™t -- the la -- the -- the 
rules were -- th-the laws were called, fo
r people who didn™t ha
ve any housing, to 
take over the Jewish houses. But these we
re just making business out of it, even 
though they  had wo nderful houses, they 
took over from the Jews, and rented them 

out to Jews. They  wo uld advertise them as  such, Jews preferred, and exorbitant 
prices, and just made out a -- a business 
out of it. All sorts of aspects are -- 
atheistic Jews -- Jews or a -- or non-Jews
, they were still considered Jews for 
deportation. And a bunch, a large number 
of baptized Jews, baptized to either 
Greek Orthodox or Catholic, and the Catho
lic Nuncio and the Pope insisted that 
they are Catholics and they 
are not to be treated or mi streated as Jew s. But the 
Greek Orthodox, they 
insisted that they -- if they 
claim to be Christian, they 
should be deported as -- to go out and a-as
 -- what do you call it, to proselytize 
other Jews in Transn istria. So that wa
s their position. And certain pogroms in

Kishinev and in Iasi. The one
 in Iasi, I perso n ally expe
rienced, in hiding. And a 
lot of things that even th
ough I was youngster and lived
 there during these years, I 
did not understand it, and di
d not know it exactly the wa
y it happened, until I meet 
it, or find it now in the Romanian te
xt that I translate into English. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Now is being translated and indicate
d, it™s too mu ch fo r me, but some other 
people could write papers, books. 
Q: About what happ
ened in Romania? 
A: The Holocaust in Romania -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- yes. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Well, if they -- if
 some body does do 
that, some of the 
research and -- and translation that you™
ve done will no doubt be available to 
them. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: I haven™t taken advantage of these things, th-the -- for instance, this Cyprus 
experience, and the specific boats that I -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
65
Q: Mm-hm, were on. 
A: -- took to -- from Romania. These in
terviews and the first person interview 
would help me in making 
up a personal history. 
Q: Mm-hm, which you are doing? 
A: I would like to do it. Expanse -- e
xpanding it, and leave it for the boys. 
Q: Mm-hm. You have two boys? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. On e™s 30, and the other one is? 
A: 27. 
Q: 27. And one of them, you mentioned to 
me, is very interested in your history 
and -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and understanding wh at happened  to 
you, and wh at happened  in your part of 
the -- 
A: Yeah -- 
Q: -- in -- in Romania. 
A: -- in -- in general, th-the -- the Jewish causes. 

Q: Mm-hm. Yeah. 

A: That™s the one in New Jersey. 
Q: Mm-hm.

A: The younger one lives here, and was sup
posed  to come here today, but he got 
involved in an accident. He is not -- 
Q: Can you bi -- be careful with
 this, it makes a lot of noise. 
A: Hm? 

Q: It makes a lot of noise when you handle it, so -- 
A: Oh. [indecipherable] 
Q: S-So  di -- are you -- so one so
n is in-interested in what -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- in knowing, and the other one is less so. 
A: Less interested.  

Q: And -- and how do yo
u explain that? And does it bother you?  
A: No. 
Q: Do you think he™
ll change his mind? 
A: Probably . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It™s -- brothers, but they™re so different
. One is closed in, and the other one is 
all over, like his mother. 
Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm. 

A: He talks, he communicates, he 
goes, he comes, he™s all over the 
[indecipherable]. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
67
Q: And you™re going this summer to Romania? 
A: He wants us to go and I agree, a
nd maybe we™ll combine it with a stop in 
Cyprus. He wants to see 
exactly where and how. 
Q: Have you been back to either place? 

A: No. 
Q: No. So it™ll be -- 
A: It will be -- 

Q: -- quite a trip for you. 
A: Yes, for myself. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I even start charting places. 

Q: Mm-hm. And are you -- are you eager? If -- if it wasn™t for your son™s interest, 
would you go back, yourself? 
A: No. 

Q: No. So you want him to
 see th at, it™s not -- it™s mo
re for him than for you? 
A: Both. 

Q: Both. 

A: Yes, before I close the cycle and turn
 over to him, I™d like to go back and 
[indecipherable], see exactly
 where he come from and how far we went -- we got. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
68
I™m sorry my parents are not here to -- to 
-- to see it, but being th e youngest, they 
could not catch all my  developments. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: They saw the -- the other sister™s and 
the brother™s offspring, but maybe the -- 
no, my  mo th er saw the older son, cause 
he is named after my  father, and the 
youngster is named after him -- after Moth
er, in Hebrew at least. Her name was 
Sophie and his name is Sopher.  

Q: Mm-hm. What do you think -- what 
do you think it™s going to  be like to go 
back, to see those places where such impor
tant events happen
ed in your life? 
What do you -- what do you
 -- how do you anticipate it?
 Are you dreading it? Are 
-- you think it™s going to  be emotional, 
do you -- do you know wh at to expect? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You do? 
A: The -- the very original 
place where I come from -- 
Q: Bivolari? 
A: Bivolari is now -- one Jewish family re
turned there, and th
ey™re held in great 
esteem I understand. And my
 older son wo rked  here for th ree months, at the 
National Fo od Processors Organization. He
™s a food microbiologist, and this was 
tremendous experience for him to see -- in addition to  producing f -- 
[indecipherable] of food, distribution and 
placement of food is the second part of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
69
food science. So there she 
worked together with the wi
fe of an em-embassy of 
Romania employee. And sh  -- her grandmothe
r lives in Bivolari
, so she told him 
there is electricity now, they are paving 
the road. It was -- Bivolari is one long 
street, unpaved, and mu ddy in the spring. 
So  he should  go, he should see it, and 
see the rest of the s -- countr
y. It™s a beautiful country, 
no question. But I want to 
show him Iasi, where the pogrom took plac
e, that house where we lived, the place 
where my brothers were almost killed. 
Maybe Buch arest. We went from Bivolari 
to Iasi to Bucharest to Cypr
us to Israel to Detroit. 
Q: Hm. 
A: It™s a long journey. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: That takes away years. And here I am
, I need to make it up and at the FDA, I 
really developed for all these years. The 
60™s, we -- we put some sense and some 
security, safety, into the fish industry. 
In the 70™s we had the -- the mushroom 

industry, was poisoning people all over the country . In the 80™s, we had the 
salmon industry, that we regulated. You k
now, the salmon indust
ry is the larg -- 
the only country  in the world th at produ
ces that much salm
on, all around the 
world, except that the canning it -- of it was 
so primitive that they
 used to make a -
- th-the cans, flatten them without the top 
or the bottom, and take them to Alaska, 
and there press into th-the
 -- the bottom of the can, f
ill the can, put the top and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
70
[indecipherable] it. Well, people died. In
 London and Belgiu
m and Australia, all 
due to American salmo n . So FDA was ab
le to a-abolish th
at system and FDA 
hired additional insp ectors, about 600 of 
them to go around and look for these 
cans, and these cases. And finally we ca
me a b out a safe product, the canning 
industry, the -- the salmon industry, the 
tuna industry, and a few, new modern 
means of -- of marketing foods 
that needed FDA intervention.  
Q: I™m wondering if -- if your experience
s, and -- and th e things that you went 
through after the war, the depravation that
 you experienced, and -- and th e danger 
that you put yourself in to 
help  save people and yourself. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You were determined to save -- help -- help people -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- even at a young age -- 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: -- it seems like. And that motivation 
has been part of you ever since. 
A: Correct. 

Q: Did th at mo tivation, do you th
ink come from your experience -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- or was it some thing th at was there before, that came from your parents? Or is 
it all kind of come from the same  place? You know what I™m saying? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
71
A: Yes, I do. 
Q: I™m trying to  draw a link between the thin
gs that happened  to you as a result of 
the war -- 
A: Certainly, yes. 

Q: -- and the profession that you chose. 
A: Yes, absolutely connect
ed, the experience to what
 one does afterward -- the 
experience, after you co me out alive from 
an experience, you try to preven t it 
from -- others from going through it.  
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s wait a second. You said
 that -- that when you live, when you 
survive an  experience like that
, that you -- you™re mo tivated
 to help other people -
- 
A: Correct. 
Q: -- not have to go th rough something like that. 
A: Exactly. Individuals as well as comm
unities. Wherever there was a need, and 
no one went to fu-fulfill that need, 
I was ready to go, first to go. 
Q: Were your parents like that, too? 

A: To the extent that™s possible. In Bi
volari there was no time and no means, but 
still my father was involved
 with the commun
ity affairs, with the synagogue. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
72
A: But that™s -- was en ough for me to see 
that in spite of this need and activities, 
that he was involved in
, just to keep a family  of five alive.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And we all tried to help during thos
e years. The place was so primitive that 
everything had to be done
 from scratch. Even water wasn™t available, or 
electricity.  

Q: You™ve come such a 
long way in your life. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: To this beautiful home in a -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- beautiful community here
 in Silver Spring, and -- 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: -- you™re a very lucky person. 
A: Abso lutely, yes. 

Q: And you work ed hard. 
A: Yes.  
Q: Yeah.  

A: Everything was comp ensated. So this 
involvement at the museum is a plateau 
where I can walk through it, and just cont-c
ontinue. It also help
s mentally to stay 
a-a-aware and alive. In addition to those tw
o days that I -- I am at th e museum, we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
73
have meetings on Wednesd ays 
many times. I also take some classes at a Jewish 
center in Rockville. Subjects of interest, a
nd of distraction, of -- like music, opera. 
We™re very avid opera lovers. During the 
Holo caust I studied 
violin, so I™m -- I 
like th-the classical music. 
My wife likes opera, so we 
-- she comes with me to 
concerts, I go to the opera.
 And many cultural activities. 
Q: Do you still play the violin? 
A: No. 

Q: No. I remember i -- during your in
terview you talked about carrying your 
violin with you. 

A: Violin, yes, I had a picture of that, carrying the violin. 

Q: How long did you hang onto the violin? 

A: Oh, two or three years.  
Q: After you got to Israel? 
A: No. No, no, no, no.  

Q: Didn™t make it that far? 
A: I took it to Cyprus and 
they took it away from me. 
Q: Oh. 
A: They will return it to me afterwards
, when I leave, bu t I left illegally. 
Q: Mm-hm. Mm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
74
A: I didn™t go far enough with the violin, 
but I remained an av
id appreciator of 
classical music. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. I want to s -- go ahead.
 You wanted to talk about your time -
- 

A: Yes, my a -- 
Q: -- at the FDA. 
A: -- work at FDA was very satisfactory be
cause I went into areas that were clear, 
clean, no -- no one did 
any of that work .  
Q: Breaking of ground. Breaking of ground -- 

A: La -- breaking of grounds, correct. 

Q: -- right.  

A: And as a result, either as primary au
thor or secondary author, I produced ab out 
65 to  70 publications on Clostridiu m botu
linum, mostly on -- in foods. But basic, 
physiological research on th e organism that
 is presently public -- publicized, and 
used by others. We had, starting in ™65, 
an organization of -- a long name -- of the 
IBRCC, the botulism research organizati
on. But it met -- meets once a year. I 
made sure that it™s not during Jewish holid
ays, cause we meet in the fall. And I 
wrote a history of that organization because
 I participated in it from the beginning. 
So this is what I leave 
as a -- these publications and leadership in that 
organization. So  -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
75
Q: And at -- and wh at kind of work  is ye
t to be done in -- in th -- your field? 
What™s -- where is it going no
w, when -- since you™re -- 
A: Now it™s become a weapon of mass dest
ruction, and it™s all bioterrorism. And 
on th e other hand, they  took th is poison 
and made it into a medicine, Botox. 
Q: Botox? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oh my.  

A: Comes out of there. 
Q: How do you feel about that? 
A: I feel that it™s lowering, and some of our best researchers went into it to make 

money. 

Q: Yeah. And what about the 
weapons of mass destructi on? 
A: That is another problem.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And we need s -- rapid tests to det
ect it and products that might have the 
poison.  

Q: And that™s what FDA could do? 

A: Right now at -- most of FDA™s activitie
s in  the field are directed to rapid 
methods of detection, and th e milit
ary is doing vaccinations. Like, I™m 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075
 
 
 
 
76
immunized. When I worked w
ith it, I was immunized to 
the point that even if I 
make a mistake or injure myse
lf, I would be immune to it. 
Q: Uh-huh. And so this work -- this new 
-- these new developments started before 
you left, before you retired? 
A: Yes. 
Q: So you were somewhat
 involved in this rapid detection, and -- 
A: Correct.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But when we started in ™65, nothing, no
thing was known of it, or how to handle 
it, how to avoid it, how to destroy it.  
Q: Mm-hm, well, so you did a lot. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Quite a lot. 
A: Right. Really look back and like it. 
Q: You made a great contribution. 

A: Presently all the young researchers 
are trying to get me to review their 

publications, but I left everything at th
e Food and Drug Administration, all my  
files, and I try to turn them down, or 
a few I know [indecipherable] I can do it.
