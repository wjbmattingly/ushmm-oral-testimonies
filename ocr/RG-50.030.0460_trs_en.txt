GABRIELE D. SCHIFF 
 July 27, 2000 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust  Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. 
Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in
 Forest Hills, New York. This is tape 
number one, side A. Mrs. Schi
ff, would you please tell me  your 
name  at birth, and when and 
where you were born? 

Answer: My name  is Ga briele D. Schiff. I 
was born in Hamb urg, Germany, on October fifth, 
1914.  

Q: Could you tell me  briefly about your fa
mily, and about your home life in Hambur g? 
A: I was born to a physician and his wife. We  
ha d a very assimilated home life. I was the 
youngest of four children. I went to high school, as
 far as I could get in Germany. It was all 
under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 
1933, was take n over by Hitler, and my schooling, 
at least my formal schooling, came to an end. And at that time, one had to think slowly, about 

preparation for leaving Germany. 
I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany, 
and the most uneasy time  for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around. Vesters, 

strikes, and on the whole, you ar
e looking how to create a future
. My first job, as I always 
wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh 
year on, I became  a secretary in a Jewish girl™s 
orphanage. And at that time , it b
ecame  clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly 
of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Po
land. It was partly my job to help prepare the 
children for a life that we rea
lly couldn™t foresee, 
but it certainly meant separation, separation 
from the place they knew, as well as if they ha
d relatives, separation from relatives, into the 
unknown. I have done that about a 
year, and then decided to be
tter learn England, prepare --

English -- to prepare for eventual immi gration. 
I went to England, and tr
ied to learn shorthand 
and typing. I never did very well. I worked in 
household, but then a lette
r came from a colleague 
in Hamburg, telling me  that there were stil
l so many children that could possibly go out -- 
correction, not so ma ny, but some . And I decide
d, against anybody™s advice, to go back to 
Germany. And I stayed in Germany for about a y
ear, and again, helped children, also worked for 

the German Jewish community. It™s interesting th
at even though we had very assimilated, from 
the very beginning, my 50 year career in social 
work, was almost all in Jewish social work. I 
prepared for my i mmi gration, which was very
 difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we 

don™t have to go into. The secret police at one 
time got hold of me , whic h was not a pleasant 

experience. They took my passport away, and even
tually I got out of Germany, because one of 

my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me 
a fake letter that he was going to ma rry me , 
and I would become  an English c
itizen, and set a date for our ma rriage. And at that point, I got 
my passport back, and left in a hurry. Again, I st
ayed in England for a very short time . I didn™t 
work. By that time  my  mother 
and my oldest brother had immi gr
ated to England, and so it was a 
bit of a fami ly reunion. It™s a
ll not [indecipherable] clear in my
 me mory, but somewhat like it. 
And my brother from America, where I als -- al
so had a brother, came. He was a lawyer here, 
working for the office of Price Admi nistration, he
 must have been the levelator. Anyhow, he 

picked me  up, and we came  together to Ameri
ca. And it was a little funny story when I arrived 

here. People who thought I™d gone into the wilderne
ss in Ame r ica, my aunts, etcetera, had given 
me , of all things, tea kettles. So when I arri
ved here, and the customs opened my stuff, I  was 

surrounded by the tea kettles, and th
e customs official looked at 
me  and said, ﬁGolly, what do 
you want to do?  Trade with the Indians
?ﬂ That™s the beginning of America. 
Q: When did you arrive to the U.S.? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460

A: In 1937, in September.  
Q: So, just briefly ma ybe, we™ll turn back to
 your years in Hamburg, and could you tell me  a 
little bit more?  Wa s your fa mily obs
ervant of religious holidays? 

A: No, we were very assimilated. Yes, proforma  
- -  it™s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh 
Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Actually, I still do 
it, even though my life had gone up and down in 
between. And we were an upper class, very 
well known fa mily. And what you did was always 
being looked at by others. But, I should me ntion 
my mother -- and I™ve inhe
rited that from her, 
liked to help people, and she always voluntee
red. And she had what she called office hours in 
our house, and she would counsel people. And as 
a child of seven, I was sitting under the table, 
listening to these stories, and that
™s why I decided I wanted to he
lp. And another -- and that™s the 
last story of my past, we had a big house, a
nd I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a 
little money in Germany. And I was always afraid
 when the governess had the day out, and I was 
alone in the big house. So my father, to co
mfort me  one day, bought me  a  big, chocolate teddy 
bear, and said that, ﬁHe™ll keep you company.ﬂ 
I didn™t want chocolate 
bear, I wanted some body 
to talk to. So I cried. So my father, who was a 
little impatient, said, ﬁWell, you are but spoiled. 
There are many poor children who have no te
ddy bears.ﬂ I said not
hing, and I thought. Day 
before, we had taken a wa lk, and my governess 
had said, ﬁLet™s walk slowly here,ﬂ no, 
correction again, ﬁlet™s walk fast
, because this is where the p
oor children live.ﬂ So, I thought, 
teddy bear, poor children. So dur
ing afternoon, I ran around, back to
 that neighborhood with my 
chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl th
at looked poor to me , pressed the chocolate teddy 
bear into her arms. Once later, my mo ther was pl
aying bridge, and one of 
her partners said, ﬁOur 
neighborhood is changi ng, because an absolutely 
strange gi rl walked up to my little da ughter, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
4 
 
and gave her a teddy bear.ﬂ And I always say, ﬁI
 have spent my life giving teddy bears to the 
wrong people.ﬂ 
Q: You said that your family was a total of seven children? 

A: Four. Four children. 

Q: Oh, I thought you said that you we re one of seven. 

A: No. One of four. 

Q: Oh, okay.  

A: The youngest. 

Q: And briefly, would you tell me  what happe
ned to your fami ly me mbers, your immediate 
fa mily me mbers through the war years? 

A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we
 all got out of Germany, but not 
together. We  have never been 
together again as a family. My mother left a lit
tle later than I did, to England, which she lived -- 

let™s see, she left after Crystal ni ght, and only 
got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came 
fr om Paris to take her out with the help of the 
Dutch consulate. He came, and he was politically 
quite on the left, and had brought 
quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well 
known writers, who were in concentration camp. On
e of them, Eric Musam, some  pe ople ma y be 

interested him, he was later killed, bu
t he got him out. So [indecipherable].  
Q: And did you have any encounters with 
anti-Semitism whe n you were growing up in 
Germany?  

A: Who hasn™t?  Yes, and I only gi -- I had al
l -- I -- I had, as ever
ybody else did, I reme mber 
well my first encounter, when I was, well, ma
ybe 12. I had a girlfriend, 
very blonde, and very 
Aryan, and her father wa s an architect, and we 
were quote, best friends, end quote. And from one  
day to another, she said, with tears in her eyes
, ﬁMy father forbade me  to play with you any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
5 
 
longer, because you are Jewish, a
nd he belongs to a certain Germ
an organization, and would be a 
danger for him if his daughter is 
running around with a Jewish girl.ﬂ
 That was my very first -- 
and, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you me t it 
everywhere, from your greengro
cer -- and you met the other,
 too, people who stood up for you, 

and perhaps a most outstanding one was we ha
d a super in our house, and he denounced my 
mother to the Secret Police, and denounced
 me , too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend, 
which was against the Nuremberg laws. So, I mean, 
we had our share of this, but compared what 
later on happened in eastern Europe, it™
s all chicken feed. No [indecipherable] 
Q: Okay. I think we can perhaps mo ve on then, to
 your early years in America, and what you did 
when you first arrived. Any striking first impre
ssions that you had, and that you™d like to 
recount? 

A: Cause New York is overwhelming if you come 
from Germany, and my fa mily -- I had an aunt 
here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to
 me , but I didn't fit into that type of society 
at all. I looked European, Eng
lish was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social 
De mocrats. They were very nice to
 me , but I didn™t want to play th
e role of a poor relative, that™s 
just not in me. And I had a Quaker friend in Ph
iladelphia, who was a teac
her of music. And we 
had been through a lot in Ha mburg together, we 
had gone to school together. So I phoned her, 
and said, ﬁEtta, please get me  a job, any job.ﬂ And she came through. And I lived in the house of 

a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta 
also had a room. And I 
did a little a-around the 
house. I™m really not very well trained in that
 respect, but they were very good pe -- we re 

actually lovely people. I took a little bit care of children. And m
oney I didn™t have. Furs I had, 
but no mone y. And the ma n of the house, who was a 
lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I 
have a usable brain. And he thought
 to get anywhere in this c
ountry, I would have to study, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
6 
 
get at least a Bachelor. And he gave me  a ch
ance just try for a scholarship in a very good 
American college in Swarthmore, which has helped
 me  for the rest of my life. And they again 
were very nice, because they believed me . I ha
d my examination for the university in Germany, 
which I didn™t have, but I said I had lost it. 
And I could ma ke up for it in an examination, I 
passed with very good grades, and so I got throug
h Swarthmo re in two years. That, of course, 
was a big help, because  then, during those two year
s, I used my furniture, rented an apartment 
with borrowe d money, a nd sublet rooms to other st
udents. And that way, I got through college. I 
just mi ssed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I™m r
eally angry about, because I had the cooking to 

do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in En
glish, which was not in English literature, but I 
mi nored in German, so it meant I could con
centrate on my major. 
And later on, I took 
psychology.  

Q: So when you were in school, 
you were also focused to some  extent on social work again? 
A: Never left  my mi nd. I  did not tell you that befo
re I even mentioned Swarthmore, I had gone to 
the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had 
told me  I could not study social work if I 
wouldn™t have an America Bachelor. It was very
 different times, and th
at was one reason why I 
was so glad to go to Swarthmore. And the day I ha
d my Bachelor, I went  back to the University 
of Pennsylvania, I say, ﬁHere I am, please let me  i
n.ﬂ They were very psychologically oriented at 
that time, and they seriously said to me, ﬁ W
ell, you know, you will have to work with people 
who know pain, and suffering. And to know that
, you have to know it yourself. Did you ever 
have any suffering and pain? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYeah, I ju
st left my fa mily in Europe, I make a very 
precarious living here. I™ve 
me t ma ny good things, but I™ve also me t [inde cipherable]  
Q: Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the United States? Do you recall havi ng 

that kind of emotion? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
7 
 
A: I recall having a lot of anxiety. Not so much f
ear, which is very much related. I didn™t think I 
would not get through, that never oc
curred to me . But I didn™t know how. 
Q: And wha t  did you continue to hear about de
velopments in Germany and Europe during this 
part of your schooling, and your
 early years in the U.S.? 
A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it wa s not very real to me . I knew what 
was going on in Germany. I was dead sure, if I™d 
ever become  a citizen, I would go and try to 
help rebuild. I felt guilty. I was safe, and my frie
nds were not. I was in close contact with the 
Quakers, who were the only organization, I believ
e, who could, at that time, get into Germany, 
even could -- and get into the camps. And they, at 
that  time, were star ting their so-called refugee 
section, and they ask me  to work in it, and 
to set it up. And so I knew particularly about 

Germany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if 

I™m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not
 in my me mory as the overwhelmi ng experience 
it was, becu -- I think like, human be ings, a
nd young ones, you think about studying, about your 
boyfriends, about whatever the da
y brings. Yes, it™s all going on 
in Germany, and you also -- at 
least I was, a little 
bit cruel, and you thought, ﬁWhy didn™
t these people get out?ﬂ Later on, I 
[indecipherable] they couldn™t, bu
t I was some what mi xed up in my thinking. It came back more 
and more when I -- at the refug
ee section, as my daily bread, and 
had to write and answer letters 
from Ger ma ny, people pleading for so-called affida
vits. And while I was working with Quakers, 
I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all 
things, going to Iowa. Now, i magine this German 
Jewish girl, with fairly good Eng
lish, but still not -- st
ill the the English En
glish. I was sent to 
far mers, who in their turn had rarely heard of
 Jews. So we had a great time not -- of learning 
each other. They showed me  their farm, and they
 showed me everythi ng they a -- and they talk 
with thee and thou, as the Quakers does. And what
ever they showed me , I™d never seen before. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
8 
 
And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient
, and showed me  a cow, and said, ﬁDid thee 
ever see a cow?ﬂ 
Q: So when were you in Iowa, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were 

there? 

A: The latter I can answer first one. Pr obably in 
™38 - ™39. It™s vague, but I think so, because ™39, 
I went to college, so it must have b
een before ™39. What was your question? 

Q: And wha t  were you trying to accomplish while you were there? 

A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for re
fugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to 
come  to this country. And some body had to guarant
ee that they would not become  a charge of 
welfare. And I got quite a few affi
davits, because I could plead my 
cause. I had seen it. And I did 
that, really until I went to college, working for th
e Quakers, being a counselor in a refugee camp. 
Now, this was a Quaker camp for refugees who had already arrive
d in this country.  

Q: And where was this refugee camp? 
A: In Nyak, New York.  
Q: Can you give a little more 
description of the camp, and the 
individuals you helped there? 
A: Sure. The people who were there, were very 
often couples where one pa
rt was not Jewish, or 
a -- some  were political refugees, and not Je
wish. The Quakers helped everybody. The ma jority 
had Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I 
don™t think we had an Orthodox Jew in the camp . 
But it was comparatively young people, it werema jority professional people, who needed 

retraining in this country, andthe director of that camp was 
a mi nister. That was a -- an 
interesting experience for me , and 
I learned a lot. And the camp was run like all camps, there™ s 
lots of language classes, and community interest. 
Some  sport, but very li
ttle, the people had other 
interest at that kind than sport. Was a lot of
 writing to find where 
relatives were, and you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
9 
 
[indecipherable]. There, you never forget -- forg
ot that there was a war. I mean, not the war 
[indecipherable], but there was liberation for a wa
r. And it had the most intellectual group that 
I™ve ever me t in camps. Oh gosh, I have anothe
r camptery. Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote 
what I called a national hymn for that camp, whic
h we sang for [indecipherable]. I can™t sing, I 
don™t know music, but I wrote it. And -- 
Q: Do you reme mber it? 

A: No. I know where the camp was, Sky Island on the Hudson, and that was a refrain of it, 

everything was beautiful in Sky Island of the H
udson, [indecipherable]. I threw all that stuff out, 
today it would be interesting. 

Q: Approxima tely how ma ny refuge es were in that camp? 

A: I really can™t -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess. 

Q: And how long were you working there? 

A: Two summers. It only existed during the su
mmer, for people who couldn™t afford a real 
vacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere. The food was so American, they had 

diffi culty in eating -- well, it was very well mean
t, very human, and was in the estate of an 
American psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard. She still ma y be [indecipherable] 

the museum. She™s not Jewish, but very, very inte
rested. And she had a be
autiful estate, and the 
faucets were sort of heads of 
lions, so you can imagine. Okay, so
 much for that. And after one 
summer, in ™39, I started college. And in colleg
e, I had to run intere
sti -- I had many lovely, 
lovely experiences. But one experien
ce that  fits is, I was a -- later 
on -- is that true?  No, doesn™t 
happen in college, come s  a little la
ter. So I graduated, ma de many 
friends. Was interesting to me , 
that there, we  really didn™t know who was Je
wish, and who was not. You know, that was such a 
difference. I was a rarity at that time , because
 refugees weren™ t so ma ny at that time. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
10 
 
know, I get along with people, and 
I had a great time, and eventu
ally I graduated, in ™41. And 
there was no question I™d go to 
school of social work, I got an
other scholarship, which meant 
another job on the side, but these 
things are typical for an immi gré. And I kept my apartment 
with my furniture, I rented a room -- separate
 rooms. And began to be more involved with 
refugee questions. I had a room ma te  who was very
 much on the left political, and didn™t let me  
forget that it was Fascists who did all this. 
And we were very young. And I always get involved 
in strange things, so I was -- well -- political i
nvolvements, so stay out of it. And I found life 
very interesting, got much more
 Ame r icanized. Ha d a very easy time in school of social work. 
My placement was with the children™s agency, an
d it all seemed to me  very easy. I don™t know 
why they made so much fuss about it. The only ba d thing was, I had in the morning, and in the 

evening, to travel for over an hour
, through all of Philadelphia. So 
much for that. I still was in 
touch with the Quakers, I still have them out w
ith the refugee faction. And I always have had a 
great respect and love for the Quakers, but ne
ver wanted to convert, 
because I always thought, 
you don™t run away from some thing that™s difficult 
into some thing that™s easier. So the Quakers 
were asked by the Wa r Education Authority -- this
 is now ™41. Don™t hold me  to the dates. Not 
™41, I had a -- nonsense. ™43, I graduated from school
 of social work. There is some thing I don™t 
reme mber, and that™s what -- I th
ink right after school, I went to 
Maryland, to the 
state hospital, 
because I was more and more interest ed in psyc hi
atric social work. And I spent one difficult year 
in a state hospital near Sikesv
ille, Maryland. And that was a -- 
hospital of about 3,000 patients, 
and five physicians. And there I became  very mu ch 
aware of Europe and it™s difficulties, because 
the ma jority of our five physicians had come  
from Europe, and had escaped Hitler. And there 
were also one Jewish physician who was Amer
ican. And I told you, I get involved, some ti me s I 
also in the wr ong place. I became, in my free time ,
 the director of the recreation for our camp of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
11 
 
-- of conscientious objectors. I 
could wro -- write a book about it 
if I want. And that was not 
liked by the American attendants, 
because they had their husbands in
 the war, here wa s this one 
Jewish fema le, and she was playing around with 
the people who were trying to escape war duty, 
and me ssed up situation, I was in between vics. 
And the Jewish doctor, saw me  going with my 
CO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christma s 
carols. He called me  to his office, and sa -- 
and said, ﬁIf I wouldn™t be punished, I would 
spank you. You are no [indecipherable]. You tried 
to be a Christian,ﬂ -- which I 
never tried, I just like to go ar
ound with some [indecipherable]. 
And he gave me  hell. So I 
got it from Jewish side.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an inte
rview with Gabriele D. Schiff. Mrs. Schiff, would 
you please tell me  about your reaction to the 
start of World War Two, while you were in 
America?  
A: What, of course, Ireme mber 
fi rst of all, was that I was su
ddenly an enemy alien. I™d been 
thrown out of my country, to come  to America, 
and find my self an enemy 
alien. I could not have 
a camera, I could not have a short wave radio. An
d for every trip, I had to get permission from 
Washington, which means my brother, who was 
in Wa shington, worki
ng for the governme nt, I 
could only go and see him with special permissio
n, which I got. I didn™t go too often, but he 
came to me. I -- these are individu
al things. My outstanding best 
fr iends at that time, were the 
director of the labor relations boa
rd in Philadelphia, and his wife. And they were ardent pacifists. 
And on the day the we -- war broke out, they
 asked me , ﬁHow do you fe el about it?ﬂ And 
impulsively, I said, ﬁI™m glad that,ﬂ -- now this
 is when America got into the war, -- ﬁthat 
America is getting into the war, because that 
will give the allies more power.ﬂ And they looked 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
12 
 
at me  in disgust, and said, ﬁHow can you be glad
 about any war?ﬂ And I said, ﬁIs it better when 
people are slaughtered in camps?  Do you want thatto go on for eternity? ﬂ So we had a very long 
discussion. We stayed friends afte
rwards, and we both kept our opi
nions. They were pacifists. I 
had been a pacifist for a good time of my life. As
 a ma tter of fact, when in Germany, I was the 
youngest me mber of the [indecipherabl
e] for Huma n Rights. So, that 
will always be my interest. 
But, I change d when Hitler ca me , and I gave up the pacifi st , I just coul dn™t. But that ™s my 

outstanding me mory. And then, of c
ourse, it was the anxiety, I coul
dn™t get letters from Europe. I 
had heard so much about the first Wo rld Wa r, because I was born in the beginning. But when I 

was five and six, the me mory was still very stro
ng, my parents, and [i
ndecipherable]. So, I knew 
what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody 

had it. I don™t know, I was in an institution, in 
that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got 
very little to eat, but I realized it was still mu
ch more than they had in Europe. And then, of 
course, I had very strong sympathies for the al
lies, and once in awhile
, I got letters smuggled 
from England, or from my sister in France. I 
suffer always for some  contact, some body asked me  
this question. I don™t remember if the letters were
 censored or not. I don™t th
ink I ever was out of 
contact with my mother. I looked --
 I kept my mot her™s address, but
 not the war time, one, so I -- 
I really don™t know. I reme mber how I threw my 
camera into a river, because I wasn™t permitted 
to have it. Why I didn™t give 
it to an American colleague, I 
don™t know. And I -- I did not have 
too ma ny Jewish friends while I was in Philadelp
hia. I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one 
was American, and as I implied, very much on th
e left. The other was also from Ger many, and 
very assimilated. And so certainly we  were intere
sted, we read the papers, and we hoped that war 
would be over. But we also tried very hard to liv
e from day to day. Now, this changed for me  in 
1943 or four. I™m really not good with figures
. When the Wa r Education asked me  -- War 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
13 
 
Education Authority, to go to Oswego, New Yo
r k. And Oswego was a camp, it was a for mer 
army ca mp t hat had barracks, and awful ones. 
And there™s barbed wire
 around. It always amaze s 
me , the only time I personally have been in the ca
mp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in 
America. Because I was always insisted on livi
ng right in the camps, because you can™t be of 
help if you are billeted in a hotel
 outside. And these we
re a thousand refugees, who had been in -
- yeah, it was called concentrati
on camps, but were not extermin
ation camps, in Italy. One was 
called Perramonte, just for your information. And the refugees, the ma jority, by far, were Jewish. 
I think we had about five non-Jewish people, bu
t we had some . We had some  Ukrainians. And 
Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all[indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the 

governme nt, had been sent to Europe to select 
from different camps, a thousand refugees. These 

had been invited by President Roos
evelt, with the idea 
that Italy was starvi
ng, and he would at -- 
at least take a thousand mouths 
out. Well, it™s really 
not a very bright idea, but it helped a 
thousand people. And they were invi
ted to -- the whole time, they di
dn™t know if they could stay 
in this country. And what that means psychologica
lly, you can™t do it -- can™t imagine. Actually, 
one was sent back because he was insane. The othe rs eventually stayed here, in ™45. And I™ve 

met them over the -- my career in social work, a
ll over the place. And that was my first camp ex 
-- no --  well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the diffi culties of a camp. 

People not having any privacy. Some  people di
ed. One person died shoveling snow. The 
admi nistration was blamed for that. I got an [i
ndecipherable] to later camp life. The food was 
always [indecipherable], it™s always
 in camps. Pe ople have to have 
an outlet for all their feelings, 
so they fight for food. We had a few birth. We  ha
d a hospital run by a Jewi sh laf -- doctor, who 
was supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an 
MD in America. In the hospital, I had an 

operation, and I reme mb er my refuge e doctor very we
ll. However, it went a
ll right. It was an ope 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
14 
 
-- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary
 was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn™t 
have taken out [indecipherable] forget. And I stay
ed in that camp, al most  through the end. I think 
I left a month before. People eventually got the 
permission to stay. Most of them ca me to New 
York. Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about Oswe
go, ﬁSafe Haven.ﬂ I disa
gree with the book, but 
anyhow -- 
Q: Can you explain why? 

A: I -- Because she saw a side from the point 
of view of a rather 
optimistic American. She 
worked very hard, I mean, she really -- she he
lped. These people wouldn™t have been here 
without her, but how she described the camp, I don™
t quite agree with. I sa
w more conflict than 
she did. But ac -- but we are stil
l good friends, I still see her,
 and Oswego people have also 
[indecipherable] word? 

Q: Community? 

A: Community. They meet once in
 awhile, cause we all are old people now. And some of them 
died, some  of them have grandchildren. The gran
dchildren I me t in my last job, and some  of 
them, because in that job, among ot her things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and 
second and third generation. And suddenly, some
 of my Oswe go grandchildren turned up. 
[indecipherable], they are very bright, and good 
students. Europeans know how to study. So, you 
see, that™s why I say my life is so interwoven, 
one with each other, Quakers from all occasional 
[indecipherable] etcetera. 

Q: Can we go back mo mentarily to your very firs
t experiences, helping refugees, and that™s when 
you were working with the Quakers. And coul
d you give a little more detail as to how you 
started to get involved in that kind of work
?  Wa s it through the friend in Philadelphia, or 
someone else? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
15 
 
A: I tell you, my girlfriend, wh
om I knew from sc hool, was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the 
deeding Quaker in Germany. Some body writes a 
book about it, and interviewed me . So, through 
her, it was natural that I me t other Quakers. A
nd I me t a professor of social work, Hetta Calls, 
from Czechoslovakia. She was a professor of soci
al work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some  ti me  
I stayed in her house, and she was a president at 
that time, or the founder 
of this refugee section, 
and she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. 
And she introduced me  as
 her secretary to the 
American Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia.
 And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus 
Jones, and Kelly, and learned to 
loved, and admi red a lot. And me t 
my  first -- I was a refugee of 
-- myself at that time, really in the camp. What
 I had to do as a secretary was really mostly 
writing letter s, tryi ng to search fo
r people, trying to get affidavits
, trying to talk to lawyers. A 
little bit helping people to adju
st. Helping them to get lessons
 for car driving. Wo me n didn™t 
really know how to drive. I don™t know how to
 -- not today. And it was not that common in 
Germany, or  Austria. The refugees at that tim
e are mostly from Ger many -- not in the camp 
Oswego, but what I imagine Philadelphia was pretty much Ge rman Jewish [indecipherable]. 

Q: Where was the camp that was run by the Quak
ers, the two summers? Where exactly was that 
located? 

A: In Nyak, N-y-a-k, New York. It™s how -- 
it™s about an hour from here, upstate, in 
Westchester.  

Q: Okay. So, after that experience, the experien
ce  with the camps, the two summers in a row, 
then eventually, you were able to work in Oswego 
with refugees, and that work there, what was 
your daily responsibilities? 

A: Taking histories, in case pe
ople could stay in this country. 
Taking histories for the sponsoring 
agency. Helping people to adjust to camp life.
 No European knows camp. And that men should 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
16 
 
do the cooking, don™t tell me . And to see that th
e hospital functioned. We  were just -- every 
religion had a -- a -- [indeciphe
rable] what™s the word? 
Q: Every religion had a place of
 worship of some  kind, or -- 
A: No, it had a person from every religion was a 
social worker. [indecipherable] one wa  -- 
Q: Some  representative? 
A: Yes, [indecipherable]. And also a -- a Jewish 
agency. I was really quick repre-representative 
there. The Jewish agency adma roon became my be
st friend, she just di ed. And the Catholic had 
one, too. And there were lots and 
lots of adjustme nt question. Peopl
e had left their home s, didn™t 
know where the other person was, the fa mily was 
torn. A -- and as I say, we had to take very 
complete histories for the governme nt, no personal really, but there you had to know the facts, 

and the facts were not too well known. And -- and th
ey had had the camp experience in Italy, and 
some  had illnesses, and some  had ve nereal 
illnesses, and we suddenly had the last 
[indecipherable]. You had to ha -- ma ke the 
things work, you know?  The idea, to be behind 
wired bar -- barbed wire, we had 
-- we had to be in this free c
ountry, in a camp. So it was really 
psychiatric social work, 
and immi gration work.  
Q: How ma ny -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: How ma ny other people were wo
rking in that camp, approxima tely? 
A: Hard to say. We  had about -- we had a dir
ector, and a deputy director, American. We  had 
about four social worker. We  had a head nurse, 
and I think some  other nurses. We  had teachers, 
we had -- no -- no teachers there, 
the children could go out of camp
 to school. It was a fight, but 
we got to school. We  were always fighting. I thinkthat™s about what was th
ere, and then all sorts 
of people came  from other agencies to study thes
e strange animals from Europe. But the biggest 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
17 
 
group was Polish, and the second group was Yugosla
v, and they couldn™t st
and each other. And 
we also had a non-Jewish prince 
from Lithuania, who got into 
fis -- a fist fight with some body 
else, because they both thought th
ey were princes. I mean, anythi
ng and everything possible. We  
did have a library, we did have
 lectures, we did have good con
certs, there were good musicians 
among the group. It was daily liv
ing. Was a lot of anxiety.  
Q: There are about a thousand -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- refugees? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And mos tly Jewish? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And from which countries, primarily?  You said -- 

A: Yugoslavia, Poland, Austria, Germany. But we
re far the most from Yugoslavia, and Poland. 
Q: And wha t  was the age 
range of the refugees? 
A: Newly born, to about 90. We  had children being 
born there. So we had kindergarten also. The 
age range wa s really everything that had been in
 camp in Italy, and they
 had it all ages, like. 
Q: And there were elderly people, as well? 

A: At that time , over 50 seemed elderly to me . 
I can™t reme mber real old people, my age, for 
instance, my  age now. I can™t reme mber. I reme mber
 mostly i -- in thei r 20™s, and then in thei r 
50™s, but -- 

Q: What were your own living 
conditions like in the camp?  
A: I had a room, we all had rooms. Not in the 
barrack, as far as I reme mber. I cannot reme mber 
where we ate, I think it was in a mutual dini ng ro
om where all the st aff ate. I lately think it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
18 
 
all in a private house, where the officers had lived, when it was a military camp. But, I  reme mber 
well my little room, but funny, you know how [indecipherable] 

Q: Did you do much socializing with the other 
refugees, or the individuals you were working 
with? 

A: Both. I made good friends among my colleagues,
 still went on -- until now, I mean, we are 
now older, have died ,or God knows what. And about
 the refugees, I also ma de friends. And that 
was quite acceptable, not in all camps I™ve work
ed in, but this was quite acceptable. I had a 
young ma n interested in me  in that time , and so 
had my colleague. It was all very romantic, and 
we got to know them ver y well, and so me  of th
em, on later stages, became my clients. One -- for 
instance, my  agency, when I say my agency, I mean
 Self Help. I worked 39 years, so it sort of 
became mi ne, build a house here in Cos-Cosina
 Boulevard for displaced persons, and -- a big 

apartment house. And one of the first people to 
move in was a client from -- of mi ne, from 
Oswego. So ways always cross again. 
Q: How long were you in Oswego? 
A: Pretty much from beginni
ng to end, just in a year. 

Q: What were the da tes, approxima tely?  Do you recall? 

A: Yeah, from ™44, to ™45. 

Q: We re you paid to do that work? 

A: Yes. Wallit -- well, the government paid me. No idea what, but they did pay me. 

Q: And had you received any very specific, speci
alized training for working with refugees by 
that point? 

A: Just my heart.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
19 
 
Q: What would you say you were ab
le to learn about the war, or
 other events taking pl ace in 
Europe, from the refugees, that
 you had not learned elsewhere? 
A: I did not know that there were
 camps in Italy. I did not kn
ow the war conditions. Yugoslavia 
had an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha. I 
had not known of that exis
tence, and the ma dness, 
and the badness of the war was re
ally beginning to come  home to
 me , whe n I heard these people 
who had escaped by night over the 
mountains. Who had sent childr
en to other countries. The 
living with danger, the constant being afraid some
 knock at the door will be
 the secret police, and 
you™ll be  take n away. It became all a reality. And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt di ed, 
and that had a terrific effect on the camp populat
ion. They were really de
pressed. It™s some thing 
that is now a -- people don™t want to acknowle
dge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt 
ma de ma ny mi stakes. But he also was a big hope 
for people. And, of cour
se the ones who ca me  
to America loved him for that in -- invitation, 
and they were devastated when he died. They 
couldn™t know that Truman did much more perhap
s, in the end, but it was really a -- a ma jor 
depression. I always felt that all 
the deaths they had seen in Eu
rope were suddenly comi ng to life 
again by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of 
been a power figure to them. So all that ma de 
the whole time much more real to me . I -- also, 
I didn™t have as much of a private life. In 
Philadelphia things were going on, but here you r
ead the papers much mor e , and people had a 
country, but they had lost
 their parents. You saw, actually th
e people. [indecipherable] had been 
in the hospital, the doctor had refused to take
 care of them. And for the first time you really 
heard it, from word -- by mouth. So yes, it -- I alwa
ys said this was my od
erver to camp life.  
Q: Did Roosevelt™s death also
 repr esent great uncertainty? 
A: Yes. It did represent gr
eat uncertainty. There was uncer
tainty anyhow, about who would 
come  next, and how would he handle it?  It 
just brought home the nothinglessness, of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
20 
 
refugees. No country, nowhere rea
lly to go, no profession, they coul
dn™t make it. Just emptiness, 
all gone.  
Q: We re there cultural or re
ligious activities in the camp?  
I believe you already mentioned 
concerts, so there were so me cultural activities. 

A: Yes. There were -- you had to be very ca
reful what you did, because there were these great 
political differences. And you very easy got into a fi
stfight or some thing of that sort. So we tried 
-- we tried to have lectures, but 
not about politics, if possible. Oh 
yes, we had the other thing. As 
we were supposedly strange animals, yeah, they 
sent us a psychiatrist
 from Chicago, who was 
supposed to help people. I think he may have be
en of European origin. He certainly didn™t know 

how to handle people in camp. And 
he asked questions you ask in 
your private office, but they 
are do -- not applying to camp life. But the admi
nistration was very proud, 
we had a psychiatrist. 
We were glad when he left, but -- 

Q: What was his name? 
A: Dreyfuss. I think that™s correct. 
Q: Did you have much s uccess in he lpi
ng indivi duals find family me mbers? 
A: We didn™t do too much of that in that cam
p. There was another outf
it what worked out of 
England, a location service, which ma tched thousands
 of families, but we didn™t do it, we didn™t 
know how to do it there. And we r
eally were extremely busy with 
keeping things under control. 
People went on hunger strike, it -- all sorts of thin
gs. They fought with each other. As I say, 
some body died shoveling snow, and fa mily t
hought the admi nistration should never have 
allowed him to shovel snow. And that™s the only 
one I reme mber, there may be other ones. And 
had organize that people were visitor in the hos pital. They were always so busy, the men were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
21 
 
not so busy, the me n had a difficult time to take
 wome n™s jobs, like cleaning the barrack rooms 
they had. We had single me n, and they had to 
take care of their sha
bby, little apartments.  
Q: How would you characterize 
the political tensions that
 you referred to earlier? 
A: They were old border tensions, between the 
Yugoslav and the Austrians. And then there are 
always fi ghts between the Poles, and the German
s, I mean [i ndecipherable] traditionally have a 
little fi ght. It was not really 
politics as such, it was just old 
enemy. It was excited people who 
would use every little incident to get excited about. 
Q: We re people housed together wi
th other individuals of the same
 nationality, or was it a mi xed 
housing situation? 

A: I can™t [indecipherable]. I think they were [i
ndecipherable] but I am 
not sure. I think there 
were.  

Q: And you were me ntioning earlier about me n havi
ng to take on roles that
 traditionally were 
carried out by wome n. Were me n 
a nd wome n e ssentially doing the same  type of work in the 
camp? 

A: Yeah, I think the me n helped in the kitchen, 
but so did the wome n, but I know we couldn™t get 
the men to work in the kitchen.  

Q: Is there anything else you™d like to add a
bout your time in Oswego, before we move on? 

A: No, not really, no. I forgot to
 say that during my time in Ma
ryland, I became a citizen. That™s 
important because I wanted too much to be
 a citizen, to eventually go to Europe. 
Q: What was the process like in becomi ng a citizen? 

A: You know, it™s all 60 years ago. 
I had to bring a witness. I was 
the only one to be naturalized, 
and funny enough, in the small town of We st mi
nster, Maryland, they hadn™t naturalized 
anybody, as far as I know. Anyhow, I hold number one 
certificate. And of c
ourse, I was afraid, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
22 
 
should know some  American history, and I know I 
got questions, what ma kes a suggestion a bill, 
when it had to become  a bill, and so on. 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n, on July 27, 2000, in Forest
 Hills, New York. This 
is tape number two, 
side A. On the last tape, we were speakingabout your time in Oswego, and -- where you were 
working with refugees, and now perhaps you can 
tell me  what  you did after you finished your 
time in Oswego. 

A: When I came back fr om Oswego, I had move d from Philadelphia to New York, and I was 

waiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Eu
rope. I went back to a job I had had before, and 
that™s the juvenile court. I wa
s always interested in worki
ng with delinquent youngsters -- so-
called delinquent. And I worked for what™s ca
lled Youth House for boys, and later for Youth 
House for girls. Again, as a psychiatric social wo
rker, taking histories this
 time  for the judge to 
have -- ma ke decisions what to do with a youn
gster, send him home, go to placement, or 
whatever was indicated. I had done that early in
 the game , I forgot which year. I did it again 
when I came  back from Oswego, and that was by th
e mi ddle of ™45. And I did it until the end of 
™46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Comm
ittee, to Europe. I had been in touch with the 
Joint a long time before. Actually, I™d known about
 it all my life, cause my fa mily was very 
instrume ntal in it™s creation. And the Joint was on
e of the agencies working in Europe after the 
war. The other was UNRRA. Those were the two 
ma in agencies. Of course, every religion had 

it™s representation. The Joint, and the U.S. Ar my, 
and the UNRRA was p-part
 of it, were really 
the most constructive factors in rebuilding. I am very
 aware that they are u
nder a lot of criticism, 
but having been on the spot, I can say that they 
pe rforme d a mi racle. Europe at that time was 

chaos, people not knowing where they camefrom, not knowing where they were going, 

practically not knowing who they are. The Joint 
and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
24 
 
camps, with the  help of the army, for  various gr
oups, eventually for all 
people. There have been 
so ma ny ca mps, and they were different in the 
different zones. You had the British zone, and you 
had the American zone. I can™t reme mber if they
 had a Russian zone, but they had three zones. 
And e m -- each zone had it™s country director, and 
then there was a director for all the work, in 
Paris. He was in charge  of it all. I know that wh
en I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be 
oriented towa rd what was expected to me  -- of
 me, and to be assigned 
to a country. I did not 
know when I left here where I would go. I assume
d it would be Germany or Austria because of 
the language. To my great surprise it was Italy. 
And my much bigger surprise came, I went to 
Rome , because the capital always wa s the center 
where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few 
weeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita
, City of the Movies. 
It was the Hollywood of 
Italy. And that was a camp for every refugees th
at had been picked up. Every nation, and wi -- 
religion. Men, wome n, c hildren. I don™t know how 
ma ny. To me  it seeme d thousands, it ma y not 
have been. And that camp, I reme mber as a night
ma re. If you ask me  who admi nistered it, I do 
not know any more. I know it had no individual 
rooms. There were partitions between the 
fa milies, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheet
s, where you could hear every noise from the 
neighboring bed, which means your private life was 
open to the children, open to each other. It 
may be part because it was my first real cam
p, but I was absolutely overwhelmed. The  second 
day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese ha
d killed his wife. If that
 was so or not, I have 
no idea, but everybody talked about it. That was, in my me mory, the most primitive camp, but as 
I say, I had just arrived, I had 
no basis of comparison. In a way it was good, because every other 
camp see me d like -- not paradise, but at least no
t like hell. And I must say, I don™t remember 
anything of the beauty of Rome , which I had not
 seen before. I only reme mber this miles of 
huma nity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was wi
nter, I came so -- in February, I think. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
25 
 
and then I wa s told I was to go to Milano, b
ecause I had experience w
ith hospital work, and 
[indecipherable] work. And I got on long train ride
. It still was right af
ter the war, and people 
always forget, your trains we
ren™t running. Italy itself had no 
food. The people were under the 
impression still of the war. Yes, they had won th
e war, oh, Italy didn™t here -- take it back, I™m 
not sure Italy won. But they were -- everything 
was gray and gray. And  it took us very, very 
long to get from Rome to Milano, which usually
 takes a night. Sleeping 
[indecipherable] didn™t 
work, it was -- Italy was just a country in wh
ich a war had raged. And one shouldn™t forget, it 
wasn™t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the 
Italians themselves. Y
ou were hungry, and tired, 
and had no work. When I arrived 
in Milano, this rehabilitation 
center, being a for mer hotel, 
looked like absolute luxury. I did not stay in 
the place. I think that had had reasons, because it 
was tuberculosis all over the place. We had, 
as far as I reme mb er, no children. Some  younger 
people. I reme mber a young woma n, perhaps in 
her early 20™s, from Yugoslavia, who had 
survived with her parents, and they had gonethrough hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and 
died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never 
forget it, I can still pa
int her face. And that -- 
it™s really difficult to talk about, because it™s 
a double experience. Here 
you had survivors faced 
with death again. Now, what that meant to them, I 
can™t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my 
fingertips. And still you had the same  politic
al groups fighting each other, that was the 
Hungarians and the Poles. All Jewi
sh people, but different ideas, 
different religious traditions. 
Being angry at the world. This is [indeciphera
ble] people. I reme mber three of young me n who 
were not even 20 -- I me ntion that because you, at 
that age, could survive, and then in the 30™s 
and 40™s. You hadn™t ma ny old people survive,
 and you hadn™t ma ny children survive. Not in 
these camps. We had a doctor from South Africa,
 who was the M.D. director of the camp, and 
we had Displaced Persons physicians. We  had about
 three physicians. Now, either ask me  how 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
26 
 
ma ny patients, I really don™t know
, about a hundred, could be mi stak
en. Too long ago to ve -- to 
reme mber fi gures. And, what perhaps has to 
be me ntioned is that was the time where 
streptomycin was a rarity. The doctors practically
 only had lermotorax to work with, which was 
a much more complicated procedure, nobody [ind
ecipherable] it could be dangerous. Also, for 
the TB doctors, they had to stand very long. 
This is procedure, and I know once or twice 
some body fainted. And streptomycin, we always ha
d to get on the Black Market. Now, this was 
the center of the Black Market. You exchanged stre
ptomycin for either co
ffee or cigarettes. And 
the accepted -- accepted currency 
were cigarettes. And -- and th
e other thing was, there was 
some thing -- the army run co -- called the PX, wh
ich was like a shopping center, with a very low 
prices. And we had, as American, or an Englis
h workers, we could buy there, and we could 
exchange. There are also two currencies. Ther
e was green dollar, and oh, what was the other 
called?  A script. A script, as 
far as I reme mber, you couldn't ta
ke out of the country, I don™t 
reme mber it. The green dollar was much better
, and you could get anything for a green dollar, 
from two dollars to [indeciphera
ble] dollars, there was no rule 
or regulation. And there was a 
fight to get food, because the Germans had no f
ood themselves. And all these things are of 
course, forgotten. Now, one of these stories -- 
oh, I don™t know how ma ny, ha
ve been in articles I 
have written over the years. They are not very
 new. I™ve told them before . But one can™t 
duplicate them, I can™t invent new ones. And one which shows you the difficulty with food. 

Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very
 bi g role. And these were the fi rst holidays in 
freedom. So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it™s 
r e al l y  abcent er , want ed 
to be like home , and 
have geese and chickens for Rosh Ha shanah. Now 
how to put loose geese and chickens, when all 
I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me ?  
Now, many, many of my people weren™t even 
used to that. So, the only thing to
 do was to ask if any of the DP
™s would be able to look after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
27 
 
live chicken and geese, and there was some body. So
 then I went to the ma yor of this little 
village, and asked if I could ha
ve some , I would bargain against 
canned peas, and stuff like that. 
Well, they let me  have some . So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk. And they were a 
big excitement, we had them for a fe w months. 
We had to feed them, they were like everybody 
else, starving. And the whole group, of course, 
was very mu ch interested. And Rosh Hashanah 
came. We  had a cook who was German and not  Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he 

was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you 

know what a mushkia is? The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, 

came in, and he looked at it and said, ﬁTrayfa, no good, no good. You can™t eat them. Now tell 

your community what happened.ﬂ I said, ﬁWe m -- 
have to find a way out. This means life to 
them.ﬂ We ll, I had an Orthodox part, a community, 
they all wanted to go right to America, and 
the un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestin
e. Now, the un-Orthodox said, ﬁWe can eat -- 
eat it.ﬂ The Orthodox says, ﬁTrayfa, trayfa, 
it can™t be done.ﬂ  Then the Orthodox committee 
came to me and said, ﬁYou know, you have to as
k a mi racle rabbi.ﬂ A-Again this gentlema n 
assimilated [i ndecipherable]. We ll, eventually, 
I found a mi racle rabbi in a camp in Austria. 
Now, try to phone, in occupied Germany a fter the 
war from one country to another. I had to call 
General Clay™s office, who was the commander of
 all of the German zones, and I got some 
soldier who thought I was utte
rly nuts. ﬁWhat do you want, chicken?  Buy some  chicken.ﬂ 
ﬁExcuse me, I have to,ﬂ -- ﬁAll right, you get cl
earance.ﬂ I get clearan
ce, I call for the wonder 
rabbi, and I get him. And he says
, ﬁFirst of all, are you a Jewi sh daughter?  We ll, this is a very 
difficult question, I have to think about it. Woul
d you call back in two hour? ﬂ  I said, ﬁBut the 
things have to be cooked. I have no time to wa
ste, I have excited people.ﬂ Call back. So I go 
through the whole thing agai
n, get the same  soldier to Clay™s o
ffice, who just -- who just shakes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
28 
 
his head, I am sure, but gives me  
clearance. And then I get the answ
er, it™s a little diffi cult to 
transl ate from the German Jewish. ﬁIf the geese 
and the chickens were boiled in water that was 
higher than the boiling mark, then th
ey are trayfa, but if that wa s lo
wer, if was water right out of 
the faucet, then they can be eaten.ﬂ So I wa
s on very good terms with a young DP camp director, 
who had had a baby. I said to him, ﬁPlease, you bathed your baby this morning in hot wa ter from 
the faucet?ﬂ He knew exactly what I was doing, sa
id, ﬁYes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.ﬂ I we nt back, 

called my t wo committees together, and said, ﬁThat™
s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, 
we can™t go any higher, and we are going to eat 
the animals.ﬂ And we did. But these st ories, once 
in a lifetime. Bad food is in all institutions, one of the ma in cause for trouble, because pe ople 

don™t have so ma ny things to fight about, and they
 let out all their host
ility, their fear, their 
anxiety, on food. And I have had so ma ny debate
s about food, you can™t imagine. In the three 
centers I worked in. So that was part of it, but
 the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with 
the families, some were all over the place, if they 
were alive, was really unforgettable. On a more 
cheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp. A
nd that again is a story, how overly sensitive 
people are under those conditions. This young co
uple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know 
what it is? To Palestine. And wh
en they ma rried -- at that time, of course, we had to create a 
wedding dress. We ll, the Joint had sent us lots an
d lots of ma terial for cottons, and out of the 
cotton ma terial, we ma de dr-dresses for the whol
e group. And in a actual 
over-identification, I 
made myself a dress, too. We must have l
ooked like a flower garden. Anyhow, when they 
ma rried, I wanted to give them a we dding pres
ent. You don™t have very much to give, and 

anyhow, mo ney seemed to be the most important. 
We ll, I took some  lira and put them in an 
envelope, which was from my office, it was a li
ttle torn, and the young lady 
first said -- didn™t 
say anythi ng. And much later came to me and 
said, ﬁI didn™t thank you, because I was annoyed, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
29 
 
because you didn™t take care enough to put that 
money in a nice envelope , and write some thing 
nice on it. We are taking that money, not for our pe
rsonal gratification, but we
™ll give it to Aliyah 
beth.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou™re welcome, if that gives 
you satisfaction. I™m sorry. I surely didn™t want to 
hurt you.ﬂ But that™s typical for the over-sensitivi
ty. That was a Greek girl from Saronica. And I 
found them a particularly sensit
ive group. I don™t know as mu ch as
 [indecipherable] that I know 
about the other European countries. But they ar
e a very sensitive group to work with. We had 
quite a few. We also had a supposedly Sephard
ic Jews -- Jew, from Greece some wher e, who 
turned out not to be Je wish at all. He was a Tu
rk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber 
out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber,
 but he ran away, end of story. As I say, the 
interesting thing is that all that
 I reme mber so well, probabl y because  I felt guilty that I coul dn™t 
do more to help them, that they all have forgo
tten the bad part, and of 
course, compared to the 
concentration camp, this at least meant some  secu
rity, but that they didn™
t know to which country 
they would go. I reme mber one woma n who ha
d a utterby breakdown, with good reason. She had 
waited and waited for her husband, eventually lo
cated him i n Poland, but he was ma rried to 
another woma n, he had thought she was dead. And-- help. And then, a young lady who really -- 
later in this country, when I met her, by chan
ce in the street, became a friend of mi ne, had 

marched all the way from Romania, that wa
s days and nights. And she was young, she was 

almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and 
almost all her fa mily had been killed, but one 
brother who had gone to Palestine. And she tried 
violently to ma ke an adjustme nt once she™ll 
come  to America. Had bad case of TB. They all 
had TB, but this was one of the worst. And I 
looked after her, I s -- sat up at ni
ght with her, etcetera, etcetera
. You do what you think has to be 
done. It™s not always social work, what™s [indecipherable] happen. And one day we got a cable 

from Palestine that her brother had died in th
e war against England. Now I had the nice job to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
30 
 
tell. And of course, she practica
lly lost her mi nd, and so for quite
 a few nights I stayed with her 
in her room, and played, as well as I could, mother
 figure, but -- and she ne
ver got over, not even 
today, is happily ma rried, but she had to tell all 
her past. Many didn™t talk
 about their past, but 
she felt she want to describe the halls, and there were ma ny c hildren. It wa s a very religious 
home . And s o every day, we set as
ide a certain hour for telling. A
nd then I left, and I didn™t hear 
about her. I thought of her sometimes. I had a pict
ure, with a very nice dedication. And really, 40 
years went by, and I -- I™m here in
 Forest Hills in a street, in fr
ont of a store, looking at some  
hats. And a very tiny voice behind me  said, ﬁAren™
t you Miss Tarenberg?ﬂ Th
at was Celie, that™s 
her name , Celia. And she had come  to this countr
y, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium. 
Had ma rried, happily. He r husband died. Had ma rri
ed again, living quite 
near here. Has two 
wonderful children, and is a very good bus
iness woma n, whi c h I™d never thought. Had 

[indecipherable] in business. We  see each other once in awhile. It™s gone -- I never 

[indecipherable] some thing, I cannot identify this
 [indecipherable]. You fi
nd that in DP camps, 
people became either very, almost fanatically re
ligious, or said a God 
who lets concentration 
camps happen. It™s very difficult to say some thi ng to either. But I found th
at over and over again. 
And it™s interesting that  the stories I got at that ti
me, went riva -- really well, just about liberat ed 
from ca mps, were quite different than what
 you get today. I reme mber, I think out of my 

personal sy-system, I reme mber so well a young ma n 
who was very close to his father, they were 
very religious, and he had seen his fa ther jump 
into the fire with a Torah in his arm. You don™t 
hear that any more. But I must sa
y, I almost cracked up on that one.  
Q: How wer e  you able to communicate with 
people from so ma ny different countries? 
A: With my broken Yiddish, and German, and to
 other me mb er, we talk English. English was 
taught in the school in Ge rmany, and so when
 you had people from Ger many, who went to a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
31 
 
high school, you some times could. I do not reme mber
 communications di fficulties. In what we 
said, yes, but not language-wise. 

Q: Did you start learning 
other languages yourself? 
A: No. I can make myself underst
ood in -- in -- in It
alian, or in Dutch. In Europe you pick up 
languages from traveling, but I don™t speak that. 

Q: So I just want to establish 
the setting of this experience, not necessa rily at camp, but more like 

a rehabilitation center, 
as you call it. Was it wintertime?  And 
exactly when did you arrive there, 
or as best as you can recall, month and year? 

A: I think in the mer -- no, th
at I can -- I think in Merrano, I 
arrived in the 
spring of ™47.  
Q: You talked about the indivi
duals there having tuberculosis
. Did you see ma ny deaths?  We re 
ma ny of them very ill? 

A: I -- in Merrano, I saw quite a few. They are --
 were all ready for re
habilitation, so you didn™t 
see too ma ny -- they were not -- it™s not true, th
ey were not already for rehab. We  see -- so I saw 
several deaths in -- in Merrano. 
I cannot reme mb er in Passau.  
Q: Now, we re you paid for doing this kind of work, as well? 
A: Yes. I was paid by the Joint Distribution Co
mmittee, and I was paid, actually in America, 
because of all the difficulties. We  got a certain am
ount of script, I be lieve, in the country where 
we worked. But we came back to America, and f
ound quite a bit of money 
after three years. We  
weren™t rich, but -- 

Q: Did you sign up for a certain 
time  period to work there? 
A: Not on a certain place, a contract was usually
 for 18 months, but you could break it any time, 
if you had to, and people did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
32 
 
Q: Did you have any other friends, or acquaintan
ces in the United States, going to do this same  
kind of work in Europe? 
A: I had two friends who did -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interv
iew with Gabriele D. Schiff. On the other side, 
we were talking about people you knew, who also went to do relief work, and work with 

refugees in Europe. 

A: Yeah, I know these two, and I met other people
 in Europe with whom I still am friends, 
colleagues of mi ne. 

Q: What was the jour ney like to get to Europe? 
Any specific recollections  of that expe rience? 
A: No. I don™t even reme mber if I came  -- pr
obably by boat, I don™t reme
mber anythi -- yes, 
yeah, I came by boat, but I really don™t re
me mber  anything whatsoever about it.  
Q: I think you already ma de some  
kind of reference to the kinds of
 discussions that you had with 
refugees, and whether or not they 
wanted to talk about their past
. Did they more often want to 
talk about the war time experiences in co
mparison to their past before the war? 
A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly 
individual -- some people ha
d a great need to talk 
about their home s, and to show that they had li
ttle a farm, or a good business, or -- and I think 
people react in accordance with their personalit
y. You can™t really ma ke generalizations. Some  
people had a great need to show how clever 
they had been in surviving, while today we 
recognize that survivor, was luck. There are some
 things that have been shown, which ma de 
survivor, for instance, in a camp, somewhat mo
re likely, if you had a close relative some where 
who needed you. If you had a reason to survive. 
There are such things that one can perhaps a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
33 
 
little, generalize. Some  people who had a some wh
at guilty conscience, had to justify the way. 
There was much more things that had to be hi
dden at that time. I re me mber one ma n was so 
upset because he had stolen potat
oes. And well, there were much more serious crimes that had 
been done. And yes, after the people trusted yo
u, you would have the c
onflict that you could 
have saved some body, but you ran, or whatever it was. I always have difficulty with some  of the 
things, because you cannot docume nt them, you have
 to trust my me mor y, and some  of these 
stories, I don™t even me ntion, because I have no 
way of showing they really happened. I know it, 
but that™s my quarrel I have very often, with 
people I discuss this whole -- me mories are 
me mories, but they are not documentation. Theychange. Huma n mi nd is  stra -- is really doing 

strange things. And people who™ve changed their 
story don™t even know that they have changed 
it. I™ve had people tell me  another person™s stor
y, and thought it was theirs. So, what I always 
say, but that™s now a personal opinion. Your f
acts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories 
[indecipherable] are really the flesh you put 
on the skeleton. Cause it™s amazing wha t  happens. 
And then there are, of course, 
people who do it with a purpose. On
e experience is that when we 
were very eager to get people to Ame r ica, and they
 were -- the doctors felt they were really ready 
to go, but their x-rays didn™t show it, we thought 
of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were 
taken. And the same  people, when it came to restitu
tion in this country, want
ed me  to testify that 
they had tuberculosis. That™s very
 difficult to decide what to do.  
Q: We re there any instances where you knew 
that it was wrong to do some thing, but you knew 
that it --  in the end it would 
help some one, so you did it? 
A: I think I™m not going to answer that. 

Q: Do you feel that your own me mor i es 
have changed much over these years? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
34 
 
A: It has changed by getting old. I ha -- the fa
cts are not changed, but ma ny things I could 
reme mber even two years ago, as you see me  gropi
ng for words some ti me s, that™s the process of 
aging. I don™t think that the facts 
of any of the things 
I say, aren™t true. I 
can™t guarantee, but I 
don™t think it is.       
Q: In the conversations you had with refugees, 
did they talk much about their goals for the 
fut u re?  

A: If they had them, yes, but in the early days
 I™m thinking of right now
, they didn™t know. They 
didn™t know what country, and what would be expect
ed there. And then we 
had the alt, which is 
a trade school there, and they learned some  trad
es, which they really couldn™t use in the country 

they were going to. A shoema ker. Now we got  
many from Russia, but I mean, it™s not a very 
desirable trade here. Bookbindi
ng. Now, you would teach computer
. But that wa -- was a good 
idea, to get people who had never 
experienced the working process, 
having to be up at a certain 
hour, having a lunchtime , etcetera
. But these school -- trade school, 
they had at least an idea how 
a norma l person works. It was a good idea.  

Q: Did any of the refugees with whom you had cont
act, speak of any desire to take out revenge? 
A: Yes. Absolutely. They still do, today. And wh
en they hear some thing -- I heard some body say 
when all this business happened w
ith the French Concorde, it s
hould happen to German. I said, 
ﬁIt did happen to German, and shouldn™t happe
n to anybody.ﬂ I mean, there you can see the raw 
feeling, yes. And then, the quest
ion, will they ever go back for a visit to Germany, a nd Poland, 
and so on. And there™s some  who do, and some  
who don™t. I am surprised that so ma ny non-
German Jews settled in Germany. I never quite 
understand that. It happened, I saw it myself.  
Q: Have you returned to your hometown in Germany? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
35 
 
A: Yes. I -- I wanted to g -- to see the graves 
of my parents, because 
I™m one of the few who 
knows where her parents are buried, and Ithought [indecipherable] me , and I did.  
Q: When we re you there, and how was the experience, visiting Germany?  

A: I have been there for two days or three da
ys before, wanting to show my husband, who was 
from Poland, my home town. I tell you, a experience 
-- I always have up -- a city in which I don™t 
know a single name  in the phone book, is not my home town. I™ve heard it™s a beautiful city, and 

they were very surprised the taxi  drivers, that I 
speak German without an a
ccent. I could relate to 
the young people, who really had nothing to do w
ith all this. But when I saw some body over 55, 
or so, I curled up. I didn™t know what you did duri
ng the war. I looked at our old house. It was a 
funny feeling. But some t hing nice. When I was born, 
my father planted a pi
ne tree in our garden, 
and by God, it survived. It was nice. I always said
 I am a survivor, so -- and people have gone 
back in g -- much greater numbers to Poland. They
 hate Poland much more than I hate Germany. 
I mean, [indecipherable] is in my own ca -- bu
t I™m not a person who hates. That my Polish 
friends -- not my husband, he never hated Germa
ny. You find in there, some  of my husband™s 
stories, which you will find interesting. It -- ce
rtainly you had people who never stopped talking 
about what they did to escape, or to get out. And 
it was good for the ego, I thi
nk, it -- then, in this 
country, nobody wanted to hear abou
t these stories. And now, it has 
become very fashionable. If 
I have to read another book about the Holocaust, 
I jump. And they get farther and farther away 
from the truth. I mean, that™s natural. Life 
ma rches on, we hope. Anythi
ng else I should te-tell 
you? 

Q: When wa s your visit to Germany, the one  
you were just referring to with your husband? 
A: 1953. ™54.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
36 
 
Q: And just to go back mome ntar
ily, to the conversations you hadwith refugees in Italy, and any 
talk -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- of revenge. What, at that time, was any of 
the specifics of -- of re
venge that -- that people 
would have liked to have 
taken if they could have? 
A: You know, they really didn™t have the strength to do more than throw a -- a few words 

around, all the Germans should be killed.  These str
ong words. Yes, they should be taken off this 
earth, I™ve heard that. I never he
ard other children should be kill
ed. I mean, you would think that 
come s in from the [indecipherable]. I never he
ar d it. I -- they wanted to kill indi vidual 
commanders of a camp, kapos, you know, the -- yes. 
But it was a -- obviously only talk was too 
much, yet the hostility was there. Wa s -- overridi
ng it all was anxiety. What will become  of us, 
what has happened to our fa milies?  Yes, there wa
s a hatred against landlords taki ng over farms, 
or -- and then there were the differences in how
 the people had survived, which influenced their 
attitude toward everything. The people who had lo
 -- fought in the motho ghetto, they are much 
more warrior-like than the ones who had hidden 
in the forest. And you see that also, in the 
second generation. Now, in my last year, I been 
working with the 50 and 60 year old children of 
my original clients who have died. I 
mean, on, and on, and on. But now it™s come  
[indecipherable]  

Q: What kind of assistance were you 
offering to the second generation? 
A: I had them organized into groups. Now, we
 ha ve so ma ny groups, you can take your pick. I 
even had to have some body in Los Angeles, but
 I don™t know her, it went
 by letter. I have a -- 
my ma in work, when it really was work, was help
ing them to come to terms with the generation 
conflict. Wa nt to hear anythi
ng about it?  In so ma ny cases, th
e parents expect
 that the younger 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
37 
 
generation should ma ke up to them some  of the th
ings they never had. They overstress the value 
of education. They put so much pressure on, th
at the young people can™t live up to it. But they 
haven™t had it, and here they had 
the chance, they have to take it.
 All right, when the time comes 
that a 18 year old wants to move out of th
e house. You can™t go -- leave us. Everybody has -- 
else has left us. Then the young 
person feels guilty. She wants to 
live her own life, or he, and on 
the other hand -- I™ve had ma ny, 
ma ny interviews  around that. Around differences in religious 
activities. And it works both ways, I have -- I ha
d parents who were practically agnostics, and 
children were fanatic [indecipherable]. Thenthe adjustme nt difficulties. Young people here 
certainly live different type of 
lives than parents have in Czec
hoslovakia. And that depends on 
which community they live in, but now -- when I 
first came  here, I preached about the necessity 
that we should know more about DP camps, because
 they were the catch all. And I was very ma d 
when I heard of the big conference,
 that some of my for mer colle
agues are, who were very nice, 
and I couldn™t go, which annoyed me . But -- not r
eally. And then I started to think, the second 
generation is in their 50™s and 60™s and 70™s 
now. They must have some thing in common, and 
usual a soci al  agency isn™t really geared to this
 type of problem. They 
could probably best help 
themselves. And I helped them to come  together in groups. Now, we have the English transport 

children is one group. Then we have the 
hidden children is another one. There™s a 
[indecipherable] which name  I™ m -- I real
ly don™t know which. Federation of Children 
[indecipherable]. Now, unfortunately, they all co
mpete with each other. But they do good work, 
they all bring out the monthly news
letter. And that was very nice. 
I always get them from all of 
them, and I give them to students I share the cont
act with, et-etcetera. And the English transpor t 
children were having a question where you can ask 
for relatives of friends. And I reme mbered 
that my mot her, in England, as a volunteer, was 
connected with a hostel where children from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
38 
 
Germany and Austria, who went over with the E
nglish transports, stayed
 during the war years. 
And in a small pl ace in Yorkshir
e, which I had almost forgotte
n, I was up there a few times. And 
really for the fun of it, I wrote 
to the editor, and said, ﬁI wonder
 if any of your subscribers will 
reme mber an old lady in Italy, w
ho ladled out the soup for lunch ev
ery day in the hostel.ﬂ And lo 
and behold, I got three answers, after 60 years.
 From some body in Canada, some body in South 
Africa, and some body i n Maine, and they reme mber
ed my mother, etcetera, my brother. So it 
still goes on, you know?  It™s a personal experience, 
but it™s an indication that it still is this 
reaching out for the past. We ll, [indeciphera
ble] of my personal me mories. Cause the 
experiences were very different than some body w
ho was in England, or hidden in the Ukrainian 
forest. A whole group has gone back to Poland th
is year, but I don™t know what they had, I™m -- 
had [indecipherable] to find out.  
Q: In the rehabilitation center in
 Italy, where you were, in Merrano -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Correct? You me ntioned there was a Ge
rman chef, some one who was not Jewish? 
A: Right. 
Q: And was that unusual, for there to be some one German?  

A: It was not in Merrano. It was in Ba rishkami ne. 

Q: Okay. Were there other Germans working then at
 the camp, or at the cent
er in -- in Germany 
where you were? 

A: I don™t think there was -- 

Q: Or is that chef the only one? 

A: -- very much working, anyhow. There was a DP 
director, who then cheated, and had to leave. 
I can™t reme mber. I just reme mber that cook. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460

Q: We re there any tensions with the chef and refugees who mi ght not have felt comfort a ble with 
a -- a German there? 

A: There ma y have been, I don™t remember. I r
eally don™t remember any German personnel, I 
just reme mb er this one guy. 

Q: So let™s go back a little bit, to Italy again. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: And could you tell me if there was much in the way of Zionism in the realbit -- rehabilitation 

center where you were? 

A: We ll, I lived through the day in Merrano, when 
Palestine became Israel, and that was one of 
the most exciting days for the people. And we had 
an ardent group of Zionists. They were not in 
numbers so ma ny, as they were young, intelligent, aggressi ve, and I was pr etty close to -- with 

them, because Merrano is geographically near a 
pa ss, called the Brederal, and we got really 
[indecipherable] the people who went to Israel
, later Palestine, and we hid them in the 
sanitorium, and the Zionist group, of
 course, was mac -- most active in
 that. That we had all sorts 
of dealings with the -- the Br
icha, and with the Haganah, and 
-- and that was good, because the 
people felt alive, you know?  And then we brought 
people to this house of Italy, the people who 
wanted to go to Israel. Again, 
yes, people did die. I reme mb er 
the leader of the Zionist group, a 
young ma n, just before going to Israel, died. 

Q: Did ma ny of the individuals, th
e refugees you were with, leav
e for either Israel, or other 
countries while you were there? 

A: Practically nobody left. It™s -- you™ll see, i --
 the Truman act had just started. There was a 
trickling of people. Many, ma ny pe
ople were afraid to ler -- leave,
 I forgot to tell you. They were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
40 
 
afraid of life outside. They had 
been under discipline fo
r so long. They wouldn™
t tell it that way, 
but it would come out of the 
conversation. You asked me  some
thing I didn™t
 catch all. 
Q: During the time you were at Merrano, were ma
ny refuge es leaving, a
nd emigrating to other 
countries? 
A: Some . A trickle. One or two 
to Australia, and one or two to
 South America. There were no 
visas to be gotten.  

Q: How long did you stay then, in total, at th
at center?  Wha t  -- when, approxima tely, did you 
leave? 

A: I am not -- really not sure. In ™47, I had a 
car accident, I didn™t [i
naudible]. I would think 
toward the end of ™48.  

Q: Did conditions change much from the time  
when you first came to Merrano, to when you left? 

A: Some  people had left for Palest
ine. Some  had gotten better. Oh 
yeah, we had this one incident 
[indecipherable]. We  had one grim incident, wh
ich could have been avoided. People did not 
want to leave the sanitorium, because yes, while
 ma -- word of mouth, they wanted to get out, 
it™s awful, no food, but, it was actually a very
 good place. They had good food, and they had 
good care. So, when they were going to be discha
rged to a regular camp, or to wherever they 
could go, they didn™t want it, they didn™t like it
. And a group of them got together, and said, ﬁWe 
won™t go.ﬂ And there was an awful 
fight with the admi nistration, and 
I know I was sent to look at 
another sort of ca mp, that was empty, and they
 were supposed to go th
ere, near Milano. And 
when we got there, I was with them. There was no
 water, and actually not much either. And they 
hated even the [indecipherable] there. And, the 
whole group decided to go
 back to Merrano. And 
the admi nistrator there had no food for them, 
you cou -- you got food -- rations for the persons 
you have. And he didn™t know what to do. And, as he
 couldn™t -- he did not take them back into 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
41 
 
the sanitorium, they had no dama nna, no talmedge in
 Italy to stay, they we
re all sent to prison. 
Now, this should not have happened, but it did. A
nd were all sorts of law students, they didn™t 
stay in pr ison very long, I think there is a -- 
but it became a big issue. 
And eventually, I think, 
they went back to the sanitorium
, and eventually to different c
ountries. But it created so much ill 
will, Merrano never quite lived that incident
 down, and it™s written up in drawings, and 
[indecipherable] everywhere I heard this 
story. Nobody knew much about how to handle 
survivors, and how to -- there was no governme nt, there was nothing. We all 
had to do as best as 

we could, and some ti me s it wasn™t right.  

Q: Did you often leave the center and s -- for whatev
er reason, go into the 
near town, or to the 
local area, and meet ot
he r people in the area? 

A: Me, or the DP™s? 

Q: You. 

A: Yes. First of all, I was partly stationed in Munich. I could, on my free days, go to Munich, 
which was a big city in [indecipherable]. I also
 was very interested in seeing what was going on 
in the country. The country was really Austrian, 
and then became Italy after the second World 
War. And again, i -- everybody hated everybody el
se. And the Germans came out during the day, 
and the Italians at night. It was 
really very strange. 
Merrano is a beautiful little city, and oh yes, 
we had time for a private life. I was also, some
where around that time, liv
ing in a hotel. I don™t 
know why, but I did. I worked in 
Merrano, in the real center, but 
I worked -- I lived across the 
street in a hotel. I 
don™t know why, but I did. 
Q: That™s where you stayed the whole 18 months? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
42 
 
A: In Merrano, yeah. But in the hotel, no. I rea
lly couldn™t tell you anythi
ng. I can picture the 
room in whi c h I lived, it -- I know during the w
hole time , I had a room in Munich, a tiny room, 
in which I had a peasant bath wi --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n, on July 27, 2000, in Fore
st Hills, New York. Th
is is tape number 
three, side A. I wanted to ask you where you we
re living during your time helping refugees in 
Merrano? 
A: I was living partly in the Hotel Flora, across 
the river. I was also tr
aveling quite often to 
Merrano, where there wa s a camp. I don™t know wh
ere else I lived, I remember Flora. 
Q: So in Merrano you we re not 
living amongst the refugees, is 
that -- is that correct? 
A: I think so. I just can™t reme mber.  

Q: We re you successful in helping to find fa m
ily me mbers for the refugees in Merrano?  
A: Once or twice. 

Q: And I know we spoke earlier about some  of 
t he religious holidays that were observed. Any 
particular  cultural events in Merr ano, in the center? 
A: Wedding. I think two weddings I reme mber. A bris
 I remember. But, of course, when Israel 
was declared Israel, we had a 
big celebration. I™m sure we had Pesach, but I don™t reme mber a 
thing. 
Q: We re there any comme morative events, for even
ts that had taken plac
e during the war, such 
as the Wa rsaw ghetto uprising, for example? 

A: Not that I reme mber. We had the evening fo
r Jewish folk songs, and I reme mber very well 
that our youngest patient at th
at time  was about 14. She came 
to us from Bergen-Belsen, a 
concentration camp up north, I thi
nk on a British. And she never 
had any for mal education, or 
anything. He r father was a journalist in Wa rsaw, and she had a beautiful voice, and she sang a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
44 
 
song, ﬁAus straita librend,ﬂ our city is burning, a
nd she had her own tears. That™s about the only 
get together of that sort I reme mber. But again, 
don™t forget, 60 years ago, or whatever it was -- 
Q: We re refugees asked to do some  wo
rk in this rehabilitation center? 
A: Yeah, they had the school, trade school, 
and the arch, one of the [indecipherable] 
Q: And in addition to that, were 
they asked to take care of any of
 the admi nistration of the center, 
or help in any of the duties? 
A: Yes, but I -- I reme mber somebody helpi
ng with the clothing r
oom, giving outclothing. 
Probably yes, but I wouldn™t really 
ever known that, but everything so -- 
Q: How did that situation differ from what you sa
w in Oswego?  We re there more refugees there 

working to help the camp stay aflo
at in Oswego, compared to Merrano? 
A: Merrano were sick people, and 
so it was very limited what they
 could do. Yes, I know, one of 
our porters was also a refugee. I don™t know, don™
t remembe r  that it ever became a problem in 
Merrano. They liked to do it, I th
ink they were paid for it.  
Q: So now would you tell me  about you depart
ure from Merrano, and what you did after? 
A: You know, some  things are really a little di
fficult, because one™s own life gets so mi xed up 
with it. I went for a prolonged -- do the e -- no, 
I ended with the Joint,
 some where during the 
summer, in I believe ™48, I don™t know what it wa
s. And I went to Brazil, for personal reasons. 
But I needed a job, and so I went to the Joint 
office in Rio. And they, of course, didn™t know 
what to do with me , be cause I don™t speak Portugue
se. Wo me n doing that sort of thing in Brazil 
is not customary at this time. PS, I had one of 
the first flights from Rome  to Rio de Janeiro, 
which took about 37 hours. And I ha
d never been in a plane before. 
Q: How was  that experience? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
45 
 
A: Overwhelmi ng. We  went down in Dakar, were 
so ma ny big flies. Was all very, very strange, 
but [indecipherable] as the only Jew with me , th
at was a displaced person. But the Joint thought, 
what can we do with her?  We ll, the only thing 
we could think of, because they really had no 
displaced persons around, was sendi
ng me  around to get money, to -- as a fundraiser. A, I am the 
worst fundraiser under the sun in any language
. B, I was a wome n -- woman, Thirdly, I don™t 
speak the language. So, it was an absolute failur
e, but on friendly terms. We just decided we 
weren™t for each other. And I took 
the next plane back to Paris, 
where I had a sister. And I went 
to the Joint, and said --  I said I™ m back in Eu
rope, I mi ght just as well work, and they assigned 
me  to Ger many. They sort of were quite glad to
 have me  ba ck at the time. So, that™s how I 
started in Bashkimi ne. Passau came a little later,
 but I had them both t
ogether, and then I was 
stationed in Munich. But I really wasn™t supposed
 to be there too often, they thought I had to go 
to time in Munich, I better stay
 in my village often.     
Q: Did you see a great deal of devastation from the war? 
A: In Italy, I did. In Munich, I only saw the ma in 
streets, really. In Frankfort, I saw a lot. But it 
obviously didn™t impress me  very mu ch, or I w
ould be able to reme mber details, I don™t. 
Q: Did you feel very different 
about being in Germany, than when you had been in Italy, right 
before?  
A: Yes. To be in your own country, in an Amer
ican uniform, and not belong anywhere is very 
difficult. And I didn™t like the Germans very mu
c h, and I never liked the people from Bavaria, 
the city was prejudiced, but th
ere it was. I never felt at hom
e in Munich. I got along we ll in 
Bashkimi ne and Passau. Now, in Passau, I spent 
month in the hospital. You can have it as a 
story, I mean, I -- in a way, connected. We all 
had the command of Jeeps in Germany, because 
they were always meeting in another place, or  
yet to another camp. That™s how I saw so ma ny 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
46 
 
camps, because you were sent to see if a patient ™s
 ready for discharge, or  whatever. And we had 
a person in charge of our own district, from 
England. And there was -- there were me etings 
forever, and this was in Nove mber, this I re
me mber. And it was a very foggy night, and I had a 
young Czech driver, who meant very well, but 
di dn™t know too much about driving. And we 
couldn™t find the house of this English comman
der. And we drove down a mountain, and where 
he thought was a street, it was 
a mountain going down, and the J
eep rolled over, and over, and 
over. Have a happy ending. And I don™t know mu ch wh
at happened after, I was first taken, I™m 
told, to the house of the commander. I was uncons
cious, and then eventually taken to the Passau 
hospital. There I woke up, in a German hospita
l, which was all I needed, and with a big, s-
swollen head, and it turns out that I had a fracture 
of the skull. Luckily, my driver came the next 
day. Nothing had happened to him, and he wanted 
to apologize. It™s very often the person who 
sits next to the driver. And I was in that hospita
l for months. I think it wa
s March that I got out. I 
was very lucky, I had no le -- nothing left over. 
My eye is a little a
ffected, but for weeks I 
couldn™t see, I thought I would ne
ver see again. And it was not Christma s, was some  holiday, I 
know people were very nice to me , and a Catholic
 priest always came and gave me  the Last 
Rites, and I could really take 
my choice. And eventually I was asked, where would -- did I want 
to go for a convalescent leave. And I chose Me
rrano, because I knew doctors there, and I knew 
the place, and I didn™t want to go to a German 
German place. And in Merrano, I me t my future 
husband, who was a doctor there. So I said to the 
end of his life, ﬁI had to fall on my head to 
meet you.ﬂ So you see, it has b
een a rather ev
entful life. 
Q: When did you meet him, when was 
that that you returned to Merrano? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
47 
 
A: I me t him in ™48, we got ma rried in ™52, 
cause we had different quotas from differ e nt 
countries. I was an Ame r ican citi
zen, he was Polish, and so they had a long to-do, but we ma de it 
eventually. 
Q: How long did you stay in Merrano at that point? 

A: I guess about four weeks, and then I went back
 to work. I went to the end of that contract, 
then they established another year [indeciphera
ble], I don™t know the name , I went there a few 
times, to help the worker there to get organize
d, but some thing ashabat,
 I really don™t know. And 
then came back. 

Q: After you recovered from the car
 accident, were you still enthusiastic about returning to do 
the ru -- refugee work? 

A: Yeah. Everybody was surprised, and told me  
I could get a pension if I stopped working. 
[indecipherable] me  all sorts of thin
gs, but didn™t really
 occur to me .  
Q: While you were working in Germany, and perhap
s even in the hospital you stayed at for so 
long, did you ever experience anti-Semitism, post-war anti-Semitism?  

A: I experienced doctors who were not nice, but they never said it was because I was Jewish, 

they said I was an Ame r ican, and we had everyt
hing. And I -I™m quite sure it was of religion, but 
I™m not one who always finds anti-Semitism anyw
here. It was unpleasant, and I was ve ry glad 

when I got out of there. There I have the documentation.  

Q: And at the same  time, did you some ti me s enj
oy your excursions to Munich?  We re you able to 
enjoy anything in the city? 

A: We ll, when I was in Passau in the hospita
l, I couldn™t go out. When I came back, yes, I 

enjoyed Munich. Had nice friends, we went out a bit.
 But, as I say, in Muni
ch it™s not -- it™s a 
beautiful city, it™s not my terr
itory. I would never go for a vaca
tion there. The countryside is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
48 
 
beautiful. And ma ny, many people stayed there. 
Munich was the center of the DP camps, and 
also had the big TB sanitorium, wher e I visite
d, never worked, Goljing. And we got often, people 
discharged from there, mostly from
 other camps , but also from Goljing. 
Q: So, would you describe to me  the conditions that you found each of the camps in, the ones 
that you worked in, in Ge rmany.  

A: We ll, I worked only in the DP camp -- in th
e TB centers. I visited ma ny of the other camps, 
and they were different. I mean, some were more
 luxurious than others. I reme mber a barracks -- 
the camps had a very good self governme nt, which I admi red, and they didn™t have barbed wire 

around. If the people could leave, I don™t know
, I rather doubt it, because it mi ght not 
[indecipherable] I don™t really r
ecall the -- I don™t know -- rememb
er any details. I remember 
camps as a -- probably because I never stayed th
ere over a day, I just went  in, took my history, 
and went out again. 

Q: So in Birishgami nes, and in Passau -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- those were the two places wh
ere you spent more significant time. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And those were both rehabilita
tion centers for TB patients? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And not displaced persons camps, per se? 

A: They were centers for displaced persons -- Jewish displaced persons
 who had tuberculosis. 
Q: How ma ny patients, appr
oxima tely, were in each? 
A: I really don™t know, anybody who 
wants to know, the Joint has a
ll these figures. 
I really don™t 
know -- 80? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
49 
 
Q: And wha t  was your routine, did you go to one per day, did you go to one and stay for the 
week?  How did you go between? 

A: Usually for the -- usually for the week. One w
eek, work days in one, and the weekend, at least 
twice a month in Munich, and then of -- to Passa
u. That was a very pleasan
t routine. I felt quite 

at home in both centers, and Munich was always
 full of gossip, who was going with whom. And 
once in awhile, I could go to a museum, or do some thing nice.  

Q: Your friends in Munich, were they Jewish?  We
re they also doing this similar kind of work, as 
you? 

A: Yeah, they were most ly Joint people, or any 
of the other agencies. I do not reme mb er picking 
up anybody from Munich, or Merrano -- yeah, Merra
no -- one, it was not a 
friend, but a person I 
was in contact with about -- for a long time. 

Q: Wa s -- would you say it was unusual for you, as a young, now American, to come  and do this 

kind of work in Europe? 
A: No. There are, of course, plenty of us. 
Q: Or as a wome n, in particular, I suppose. 

A: Wa  -- again, a great ma ny. Very
 often the nurses were also American. Oh, I trained nurse™s 
aides some time s to [inde cipherable]. I only reme mb
er we had a very nice nurse from New York, 
a Jewish nurse. No, a -- UNRRA ha d ma ny, ma ny so
cial workers, and so
 had the Joint. I 
wouldn™t know how ma ny, but I 
would guess over a hundred. They
 worked in every country, 
Poland, Hungary, and -- I don™t know if anybody was 
attached directly to the army, but we 
worked very closely with the army, and we we
re very helpful. And the American army was 
really very helpful to the disp
laced persons. The children loved th
e soldiers, they got chocolates. 
And when we called on them because there mi ght 
be trouble, not very often, they were always 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
50 
 
helpful. I have good experiences, as far as huma n
 beings are concerned. 
And I got very fond of 
the displaced persons, because they were so cour
ageous. They had such a will to live. You would 
think you gonna [indecipherable] suic
ide or anything other -- I didn™t, I saw -- we get -- we must 
get ma rried, we must have children, otherwise Hitl
er has won the war. That, over and over again. 
It really could be exasperating 
with this forever complaining 
about food. I know I once lost my 
temper when somebody complained he hadn™t gotte
n enough sausage, and after all, six millions 
had been killed. And I says, ﬁThey weren™t kille
d for you to get sausage.ﬂ They were always 
these fights. The Russian engineer
, you had all sorts of people. 
A Russian Jewish engineer. And 
we had sort of hostess, who was 
Italian Jewish. There quite a mi x 
there in Italy. They all got, 
some how, along with each other. 
Q: How would you compare the di
fferences between the groups of refugees in these three 

different rehab centers, in Italy first,and then of course, the two in Germany. 

A: That was a different time . The ones in Italy 
were still muc h more unde
r the influence of the 
war, had ma ny more concrete needs. We ha
d no money, we had invented pocket mo ney. I 
reme mber I would -- think it was Monday, I set 
a little [indecipherable]
 and gave out pocket 
money. And in Bashmi ne, and Passau, the war had b
een away a little longer, they knew a little 
better what would happen next. They were less a
ggressive, also less interested. You had much 

more, as I reme mber, mu ch more ablusionaries in
 Italy than in Germany. But I fow -- because it 
was my first, I always felt much cl
oser to Merrano than to Passau, in
 particular, I -- I never really 
got warm wi th Passau, but that was my -- I didn™t 
like to be lectured, and ma ny things play into 
it. And I had a friend in Gola, who was a
bove anybody, but some body else was the director 
[indecipherable] get into question 
of competence, and . . . it wa s the only one -- I saw cotaferata 
in Italy --it was -- I only saw -- it was very 
pleasant. And one day, I was very courageous, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
51 
 
wanted to see Dachau, which was, of course, not
 in vention any more. But I overestimated my 
nerves, I simply fainted. I didn™t see a thing of Dachau. 

Q: You entered the -- the area -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and then fainted ri ght away? 

A: Yeah, right away.  

Q: Did some one come  to your assistance? 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: Did you see any other concentration camps?  

A: No, I didn™t want to. And it wasn™t as 
fashionable as now. Now you have tourists 
arrangements to see Auschwitz, etcetera. There wasn™t my job. 

Q: Have you returned to see c
oncentration camps in Europe? 
A: No, I wouldn™t. I wouldn™
t see any reason why. I know e
nough about it, I wouldn™t ma ke 
anything better by seeing it. I haven™t even been
 to our museum here, at the [indecipherable] 
Holocaust Museum. I would have gone to the Holocaust Museum, if I could. I would go e-

eventually to the museum here, too. They got my  first forgers by that time, I didn™t really have 

any contact with Wa shington. So they wrote, 
and I sent them, and I was sorry later, but 
[indecipherable]  

Q: The refugees who were in Germany, the one
s you worked with, were they primarily from 
certain countries? 

A: You me a n in Bashkimi ne?  Yes, the ma jority was from east Europe. Poland, Roma nia. I can 

reme mber -- oh, Hungary, there™s quite a few from Hungary. Not from Ge rmany, interesting 

enough.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
52 
 
Q: How did these refugees feel about being in Germany?  
A: We ll, they wanted to get out of it, 
but again, and you can™t 
underestimate the self-
centeredness people had to have
 to survive. And Germany -- one hated Ge rmany, and you hope 
[indecipherable] what happen, and so on, but your 
ma in interest was to get out, and to ma ke 
money, and to get well. There were -- in the th
ree places, there were some  political fanatics. 
Some  against Roosevelt, others
 were against England, others 
were -- hated Germany. But they 
ma de a lot of [indecipherable] noise, no other ac
tion that I can reme mber. But of course, there 
ma y have be en things they wouldn™t have shared with me . 

Q: What sort of advice did you offer to refugees
 in any of the counseli
ng sessions that you had? 
A: Let me  pin it very mu ch on the problem they wanted. If it was a fa mily problem, which it 

often was, you did the usual counseling. I -- a th
ing I advised all of them to get into some  
working process, be it in someplace it could help
 in the village [indecipherable]. And in other, 
we had schools, in some  are -- in other, Bas
hkimi ne, there was a big wi -- camp, very close, 
where they had very good causes, so we encour
aged them to go down there. And otherwise it 
was the usual counseling, where do you -- how do you 
come  to der -- terms with things you don™t 
come  to terms with?  What ways of adjustme nt
?  Give them opportunity
 to talk about their 
childhood, about their escape, trying to set thei
r mi nd at ease about whatever they had done. 
Listen to the good things they had done. Trying to
 build up the personality as much a s I could. 
And also trying to get some  sort of c o mmunity
 council getting started 
[indecipherable]. Really, 
pretty much what a social worker is supposed to 
do, but I did it as a sideline, the ma in things 
were always what the day brought. Not enough 
sheets on the be ds, or not enough peninsilino, 
strept omycins. Could they get coffee, or decaf, or 
-- at reme mber that I or
ganized any trips. Also, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
53 
 
trying to get the doctors, to -- who were me dical
ly trained, but not psyc
hologically, to understand 
the patient better.  
Q: Do you feel that your own training as a soci
al worker prepared you for these roles that you 
had to fulfill? 

A: Prepare? Not. My training he
lped me  to find my personality, 
and to use it constructively, and 
that helped. But the actual cause s,
 it didn™t do me  any harm. Know 
what I mean? It™s -- it™s hard 
to say what you bring to the trai
ning, and what the training give
s to you. It gives you discipline, 
which I had before. It ma de me  unde rstand American
 life better, and the social system, which is 

very, very different from Europe
. I certainly knew more about we
lfare and all these things. And 
the mi xture of being European and having American training helped me , yes.  

Q: We re the living conditions pr
etty similar in the two centers
 in Germany where you worked? 
A: From the  DP™s, or from me ?  

Q: Well, mo stly for the DP™s. 
A: Yes, they were very similar. I think Me
rrano, because it wa s beautifully located, and had 
more appealing rooms, was I think, the more cheerfu
l setting, if a TB sanitorium can be cheerful.  
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is tape number three, side B, of an
 interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. Would you 
continue to tell me  about differences, and simila
rities between the different
 centers. The two in 
Germany you got to know, and if you™d lik
e to compare with 
the one in Italy. 
A: Comparisons are always diffi
cult, no ma tter what you compare. 
The thing that stands out in 
my mi nd is that the people in Ital
y were cl oser to their real  surv
ivor experiences, and were more 
revolutionary, and also had more 
of a  feeling of quote, that™s co
mi ng to me. And they really felt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
54 
 
that the world owed them a living. Certainly 
America, because it was so rich, and Ge rmany 
because it ha d handled them so badly. As far as
 the camps, they were both located in pleasant 
surroundings. I think the kooven ital -- Italy had 
more contact with th
e population of Merrano, 
than the group in Passau had with the inhabitant
s of Passau. The problems were pretty much the 
same , health, where to go to, how to handle one™s  past, and what the future will br ing. This is an 
oversimplification, but by now, some  of the details
 have slipped my mi nd. What is very much on 
my mi nd is the fact that ma ny of the people who 
are still alive, 
of my rehab center population, 
are in their late 50™s, I think 
up the end of 60, and I wonder how th
ey will handle the process of 
aging, which is some thing that affects all people,
 but I have a suspicion 
that it affects them 
differently. From my work with survivors in this 
country, I have seen that 
they pretty much go to 
a second -- through a second immi gr ation when they get older. Certainly 
the language that they 
have handled rather well, through ha -- the mi ddle y
ears, gets to be slightly problematic again. I 
find that older people, including me , are apt to 
count money in their mother tongue, which they 
haven™t done for years. Also, of course, living 
in a city, a big city 
like New York, where you 
haven™t gone to school, or know anybody from
 the olden days, ma kes you doubly lonely. 
Loneliness, of course, come s with aging, but as
 a survivor, you some ti mes ask yourself, what do 
you survive for?  I have often heard complaints 
by survivors that there is nobody they went to 
school with, no neighbors that know the streets 
they have walked in. And if it come s to 
me mories, most older people can escape into pl
easant me mo ries, and do, but what can the 
survivor escape to?  Slaughter, a
nd burning, and anxiety, and death. 
So, I think -- and I know that 
at the mo me nt, studies being ma de about it, th
at there is actually a difference. Yes, the 

experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, 
the survivor has it more so. Everything gets 
overly intensified.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
55 
 
Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging 
among the survivor populati
on in your work, after 
returning from Europe, in New York? 
A: I have. And I have had an -- when I still ha d 
cases -- later I became an admi nistrator, I have 
had cases of people who were older, and my 
agency had a coffee house once a week, for older 
survivors, and that always gave me  a chance to talk to different people, and as I™m, in a way, one 

of them, the y share it with me  quite frankly, 
their pleasures, and their worries. And, of course, 
sickness is another one, where people born and rais
ed in this country, ma y have a relative come  
in, or a long time friend when they need help. It
™s always very different -- difficult for the 
survivor who lives alone, to find a person who he
lps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they 
can have on their living will, and all these docum
ents that run all our lives, become problems, 
and ma ke it suddenly clear again, yes you thought
 you were an American, you thought you were 
at home here, and suddenly 
you feel like a 
foreigner. 
Q: I™d like to return to your time in Germany, a nd to your own living conditions. 
A: Okay, which -- 
Q: So when you were in either Birishgami ne, or
 Passau, what were the 
living conditions that you 
had on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you 
give some  picture of 
what your own conditions 
were like?   

A: We were so much daily living that they almo
st are not conditions. I ha
d a room. I had office 
hours from a bout 10 to about four. People came to 
me  when they had question about their pocket 
money, whe n their laundry wasn™t intact, or 
the cook was angry, some body had sent the food 
back. So I think part of the time, I was ma de 
of a ll purposes, and then people had some times 
gotten letters from consulates in a different lang
uage, which I tried to tr
anslate. They had to 
ma ke official phone calls, which I ma de for them. 
And almost always, they
 took this opportunity 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
56 
 
to talk about what just worried them that part
icular day. They hadn™t heard from an uncle in 
America who was supposed to give an affidav
it. The consulate hasn™t let them know s o me body 
had treated them badly. There was a rumor that 
Australia had -- took only
 people in agriculture. 
Whatever came  up during the day, and then in th
e evening some ti me s, we  really talked about 
olden time s, how it was at home, how they had 
sat around the open fire, how
 the grandfather had 
lived with them, how different it all was wh
en the Russians came , who came riding into the 
kitchen, and had very different ideas of civili
zation. Also, on the other hand, had been very 
helpful. Many had been liberated by the Russians,
 who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really 
only good things to say. Other had st
ories that they simply had to 
tell, because they™ve had such 
an injustice had to be done to 
him. I reme mber a little story whic
h is indicative. In a camp, there 
were a husband and wife, and as mo st camps, as
 -- especially concentration camps, there was 
absolutely nothing to eat. And one day, the husba
nd had ma na ged to gather two potatoes to bring 
to his wife, who was in the barrack. And it was a 
very wet, damp day. He tried to balance his 
way on bar -- bare feet through the wa rd with hi
s two potatoes, and he was very close to home  
when an SS ma n ca me  a nd just threw the potatoe
s out of his hand, down to
 the floor, into the 
mud, so that they couldn™t be eaten any more. 
And he said, ﬁThat was one time where I cried.ﬂ 
And I must confess, I crie
d when I heard the story. 
Q: How do you look back on the emotional reac
tion in you, during your time working with 
refugees, and how -- you say you cried from this st
ory. What other incident
s really got to your 
center, and bothered you, disturbed you? 
A: The interesting thing is, the 
big stories don™t upset you as much as the small ones, and the 
reason is, I cannot identify with thousand people 
being killed, but I can identify with a husband 
being proud to relieve the starving 
of his wife, and have it spoile
d. And I™ve always felt, when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
57 
 
I™m honest, it is these small things
, the things that could have ha
ppened to me , in my e xperience, 
because the other things I haven™t experienced. I 
have not lost some body i n a fire. I haven™t lost 
anybody through Hitler, really, but 
I™ve lost a mu ch -- many othe
r things, and I know the loss 
were innocent. Things I have experienced are easie
r to ad -- identify with. There are some  stories 
of escapes through snow nights. Now, I have so
me  there from my husband, but as you will read 
them, why s hould I tell them?  That -- his life was 
full of these small stories that get you. And not 
only me , but everybody we knew. 
Q: Did you feel that there was an
 emotional toll, or price that 
you had to pay to do this kind of 
work with refugees?  At the end of
 a day, did you reflect to yourse
lf, and try to -- try to come  up 
with ways to look at each
 day with perspective? 
A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if
 there™s some thing I could have done better. And 

when I found something, I welcome it. An emotional toll, perhaps it di dn™t take, because I felt 

guilty to begi n with. And everythi ng that I coul d 
do, would relieve my personal fe eling of guilt. I 
came out of it, I think a better soci
al worker, or to b -- say it better,
 a better listener, because so 
much of the help one could give, was simplyby listening with a sensitive ear. You ma y say a 
trained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this country, that nobody 

wanted to listen to them. And they were bitter about it. And even toda
y, the first thing one™s 
being told, oh well, when we came t o America, nobody wanted to hear us. 

Q: Did you keep a journal, or in a
ny other way record your reflections? 
A: I didn™t keep a journal, but when some thing re
ally moved me , I ma de either a story out of it, 
because I liked to write, or put it down verba
tim. I kept those notes for a long time, but I don™t 
have them any more.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
58 
 
Q: Again, with respect to the centers, or th
e DP camps where you were working in Germany, 
were there similar types of relig
ious activities and observances, 
as what you saw in Merrano, and 
also, what could you say about any of the cultural 
activities taking place in the camps, or centers 
in Germany? 
A: I don™t reme mber. I don™t reme mber that we cel
ebrated a Jewish holida
y. I may not have been 
there during holidays. I don™t re
me mber the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we 
definitely had in Merrano. You 
ma y have had several [indeciphera
ble] in Barishkami ne, not in 
Passau. 

Q: Do you have more distinct me mor i es of Me
rrano, in comp arison to the two in -- places in 

Germany?  

A: Yes. I think because it was the first, and I 
came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed 
in touch with some  instructors who went later 
to Israel. And the young girl I me ntioned to you as 
the youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, 
and they went to Isr
ael together, and then 
ma rried a doctor, and came  here, and stayed with me  for some  ti me , and I helped her find a job 

here. Yes, Merrano  has ma ny more me mories. Th
e others, I never feeled at home, and it was 
somehow -- it was more of a job.  

Q: And wha t  time period were you, more or 
less, in Germany working with refugees? 
A: From ™49. I think part of ™48, the end 
of ™48. In ™50, I came back to the States. 
Q: In any of these situations, whether in It
aly, or in Germany, did you encounter any fa milies 
that were intact, any family me mbers that had 
already found each other ag
ain, or was it all single 
individuals, even if there were ma rriag
es within the camps, or the cent ers? 
A: I think there were families in [i ndecipherable] in the fi rst camp, where I was a few days. I 

cannot reme mber -- I think husband and wife
, I ma y have met one or two couples. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
59 
 
Q: And in Germany, were there ma rriages in those 
camps, or centers, just as there were in Italy? 
A: Made a mi stake, in Italy there 
we ren™t, in Germany there were.  
Q: Maybe I ma de the mi stake, but . . .I ma
y have also gotten the wrong impression about 
something else. I think I was told
 that in one of the places you
 were in Germany, you were the 
only relief worker living in the camp itself, is that true? 
A: These were rehab centers, and they were 
-- they were listed as DP camps, so I use it 
some ti me s. I think everywhere I was -- no, not in
 Italy, but in Passau, a
nd Barishkami ne, I think 
I was the only one living there. 

Q: And was that a choice on your pa
rt, some thing that you asked for? 
A: I think I was the only worker, and it was 
[indecipherable] it was the thing to do.  
Q: So, in other words, when you were workingwith refugees, you were living amongst them, or 

--  

A: Yes. 
Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at 
some  other point to M
unich, is that how your 
routine went? 
A: There was never a set routine, but
 very often I would do that, yes.  
Q: And again, just like I was as
king with respect to the refugees
 in Italy you worked with, in 
Germany, di d ma ny of them wind up leaving the ce
nters while you were there, and how did the 
conditions change from t he point when you started, to the point when you left? 

A: Basically they didn™t change. Some  peopl
e left, their visa came through, someti me s they 
found a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or 
some where. The big change was, there was a 
Palestine one could go to, by -- or 
rather Israel one could go to. 
Palestine you needed the English 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
60 
 
permit, and didn™t get it. So that opened up ne
w hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful 
toward the end of my wor
k, than in the beginning. 
Q: When you would take down the histories of 
refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you 
surprised and shocked from -- with what 
you heard, or did you go through a sort of 
transforma tion during your tim
e with this work, and -- 
A: No. Even today, and I have taken hundreds here 
too, I think every histor
y is different, and it 

will get me, I sometimes get mad at the client 
in my mi nd, and some ti me s I admi re them, but 
I™ve never gotten to the point where they don™t to
uch me . The y ma y not -- I™m sure they don™t 
touch me  as much as they did in the begi
nning. But I was very prepared for my husband™s 
stories. But that came out a little later. No, I 
-- I never really got ti
red or blasé about it. 
Q: And yet, weren™t you often surprised?  Wa
s every day bringing some thing new to your 

awareness that you had not heard before? 

A: Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear a
bout a criminal act I™d never heard of before, or 
some  event I had never heard of. And that ove
rwhelmed me. There was one mention, at one 
point, which I can™t document, 
of some body who claime d to have
 eaten huma n flesh. That was 
some thing I could neither understand, nor digest. I™v
e never heard it again, other people said it 
was never [indecipherable]. I don™t know. 

Q: Did refugees talk muc h about
 war crimes trials taking place? 
A: Not at all. I don™t know which ca -- which y
ear the war crimes took place. Not at all.  
Q: In Germa ny, did the refugees often ta
lk about specific pe
rpetrators, and -- 
A: Yes. They talked a great deal about the ka
pos, the people who were 
the supervisors in the 
concentration camps. And they had grim stories to
 tell, and they would 
repeat the stories over 
and over again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
61 
 
Q: But you also heard about people who had done
 good things, and they reme mbered that too. 
Polish peasants who had survi -- had helped su
rvive a couple. Some  ha
d survived, a couple -- 
had saved a couple™s child, and some  person said
, ﬁNone of us would have survived, if it 
wouldn™t have been for people who were helpful.ﬂ 
I heard that from both It
alian -- more Italians 
than Poles. But also Germany, but less so.  
Q: Did you meet individuals from 
your own hometown of Ha mburg? 

A: Once or twice, yes. 

Q: People you had known? 

A: No.  

Q: So will you tell me  now how it came to pass th
at you left Germany, a nd eventually returned to 

New York?  

A: We ll, I guess my contract was up, and thre
e years was long enough, and I had me t my future 
husband at that time . And the eventually hope was 
to go to America. And I -- I just had had -- I -- 
I felt it was time  to go home. I had an apartm
ent I wasn™t -- didn™t know what was going on 
there. So I came  home . And [indecipherable] im
mi gration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York 
Association for New Americans. Then, for a short 
time, I went back to the juvenile court. And 
then I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in
 the meanti me I got married -- Self Help, was 
looking for some body to take over for vacation. A
nd I said I™ll do it. I came for three months, 
and stayed 40 years. And I worked as a caseworke r first, psychiatric social worker, and 

eventually ended up as deputy director. That 
was an agency that worked exclusively for 
survivors. It started with su
rvivors from Ger many, but soon became survivors from c entral 
Europe. 

Q: So you want to continue telling me  about 
this organization you worked for, Self He lp? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
62 
 
A: Right. It was founded in 1935 by German refug
ees. And they founded it, and worked together 
with the Quakers. So, in name , it is always 
a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for 
Jewish survivors -- that is not 
true, either. Anyh -- it works. It
 still has a section only for 
survivors.  

Q: Did you get involved with restitution issues? 

A: As an agency, yes. We worked closely with cl
aims conference, and the president of the claims 
conference was a board me mber of our agency, w-we
 worked very closely with all agencies, as 
another German Jewish ag
ency, the blue card --  
Q: You™ve ma de references to the fact that 
you later me t ma ny of the su
rvivors and refugees you 
had helped. And how did those meetings usuallycome  about? Did you take initiative to try to 

contact them -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- or did they come  to you? 
A: No, neither nor. Just by chance. Se lf Help ha
s a great home health ai
de service, and people 
ask for our home  health aides, and they were ofte
n survivors. And Self He
lp, together with other 
agencies, runs quite a few apartment houses, whic
h were originally for 
survivors, so I me t 
survivors there. Then United Helpers, this the 
agency has a scholarship pr ogram. I met them for 
that. And yet, there™s also a German Jewish 
based nursing home . By now I meet quite a few 
there.  
Q: What can you say about the similarities, and 
differences between the different organizations 
you™ve worked for through the year
s, that have helped refugees? 
A: HIAS is an immi gration agency founded by Jewish people from eastern Europe, and has 

ma ny of it™s connections in eas
tern Europe, and Poland, and Hungary, and so on. The American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
63 
 
Joint was founded by German Jews, and it™s conn
ections are more in western Europe. Both 
agencies are immi gration agencies, both work
 in ma ny countries in Europe, have ma ny 
similarities. There™s room for bot
h of them. Basically, they have 
the same goal, I think -- it™s  
hard to say. I really w-would have
 to read the formulation of th
eir mi ssions to be able -- I know 
what the working differences is, but what™s in 
their mi ssion, I couldn™t say. 
And then we have the 
Jewish Federation, which funnels all these agen
cies. You have a small, but very effective 
German Jewish agency called the Blue  card, which 
is a relief giving agency. The other agenci es, 

basically, are not giving relief. 
They help with everything else. And the Council of Jewish 
Wo men, I think doesn™t do anything,
 they used to help with immi
gration. And Self H e lp has 
become  rowt -- right now, an a
ll around agency, that has a -- a 
very large home maker service, 
with almost 3,000 home ma ker. No, not 3,000, over 
a thousand home ma kers
, and it has five 
apartment houses that it runs. It does five seni
or citizen centers, for the city. And in our housing, 
too, there weren™t enough immi grants any more, 
so it™s open now to Chinese, and everywhere, 
who is living in that  
particular community.  

Q: I know that you me ntioned this briefly earli
er, but I was wondering if
 you could elaborate on 
some thing you me ntioned in the way of survivors w
ho you met first in DP situations in Europe -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- showing a certain perspectiv
e about their experien
ces, and that over the years, in meeting 
them again, were meeting other refugees again, 
or for the first time even, that you™ve seen a 
different kind of perspective shared.  

A: That applies mostly to the way things are reme mbered.  
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
64 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n, on July 27
th
, 2000, in Forest Hills, New Yo
rk. This is tape number 
four, side A. 
A: In compa r ison, the more sheltered time in the 
DP ca mps is, in their me mories, mo re positive 
than it was when they lived there. There, th
e old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. Now 
that the struggle in the outside world has been no
t easy, to say the least, the time in the DP camp 
is seen in rosier and rosier 
light. I have a friend who is writing a book, who I some t i me s talk to, 
and he asked me  to give him some  name s of 
people who would give him their -- their history. 
And I suggested them. And he said it was very 
difficult to get anything negative for them, they 
were only ready to paint it in the 
most positive pictures. That, of c
ourse, is rather interesting, and 
my only explanation is that li
fe on the outside was strenuous, 
and makes the camp experience, 
sheltered life, not to worry about 
job, not to raise children, in ro
sier light than it really was. 
Q: What do you say is the long term impact on 
your own perspective, of
 having spent so ma ny 
years of your life working with
 refugees and survivors? 
A: I think for me it was a natura
l thing to do. I have never had 
any doubt about going into it, and 
I must say, comi ng out of it, I find in a way this 
history is a logical endi
ng to about 40 years of 
service, which I have given with pleasure, also
 with heartache, but that™s part of life.  
Q: I believe that recently you donated a few ite
ms to the museum. Could you briefly tell me  
about those items? 

A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most inte
resting one was a passport issued by Raoul 
Wallenberg, in Hungary, to Jews. It was given to 
my husband, and I happen to have the original, 
and I sent it to the museum. I also sent them a 
picture of the sanitorium
 in Merrano, and one has 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
65 
 
the director on it, the other our 
first group of graduating nurse™s ai
des. I also sent them most 
recently, a large snapshot of Goering, which 
was taken by my brother, who was asked to 
interrogate Goering in Nurember
g. That picture came into my ha
nd, and I thought it has a better 
place with the museum. 

Q: And today you just showed me  an ite
m that I™ll be sending on the museum. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You could explai
n that, perhaps. 
A: I really don™t quite know how
 it came into my  hands. I think it was really given to me  by a 
friend who had found it at a book fair. It™s certainly 
not a histor ically reliable document, because 
it™s strongly politically infl uenced, but it is interesting. 

Q: Would you just explain it? What is the 
actual item, just so we have on tape? 
A: Yeah. This is a paper booklet listing all conc
entration camps in greater Germany. They have 
ever listed so me  camps which I am not even sure
 that they were concentration camps, and they 
broke it down to great camps, and s mall camps.  

Q: Is there anything else
 you would like to add? 

A: I would very much hope that some  research 
will be done to the psyc
hological adjustme nt of 
the aging survivor. For instance, the influence of
 the hist ory married marriages -- marriage -- that 
will be edited out -- which had a tendency to get very diffi cult at  the point of retirement, when 

the couple, for the first time, really got to know 
each other, because they
 had the time . I™ve seen 
that, and I very -- I have many cas
e histories for that. Some body should 
really explore 
that a little 
more. And the influence of course, of the generation differences, which is much stronger if you 

live in the country which were 
-- you were not born, and where the morals, from beginning, are 
different from the ones you were 
raised with. I think I™ve said it,
 another point of that history, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460  
66 
 
this is one phase of the survivor story which
