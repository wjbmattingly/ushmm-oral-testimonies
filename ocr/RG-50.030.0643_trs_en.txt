Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 interview with Mrs. 
Judith Heimann
, taking place on Novemb er 21
st
, 2011, in  
Bethesda
, 
Maryla nd
. Good 
afternoon, Mrs. 
Heimann
. Thank you so much for 
agreeing to talk to us. 
Answer: It™s a pleasure. 
Q: And I will start the interview as I explai
ned at the beginning. 
I would like to know 
when you were born, where you were born,
 who your parents were, who your family 
was, and we™ll take it from there. 
A: Okay. Well, I was born on August 23
rd
, 1920, wh ich my  gran dson says I was always 
old. As far as he™s concerned, I 
was always old. And I was born in  
Frankfurt
; both my  
parents were from 
Frankfurt
. My mother was Jewish, my 
father was not. My father 
comes from an old farming family. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Peter Bartmann
. 
Q: 
Bartmann
? 
A: Yes. 
B-a-r-t-m-a-
double 
n
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And all his ancestors were dairy farmers,
 including my  gran dparents, whom I did not 

know; I did not know his parents. My mo th
er, on the other hand, came from a banking 
family, and her maiden name was 
Hahn
, 
h-a-h-n
. And my  great-grandfather, I think it 
was, 
[indecipherable]
 is hanging th ere on th e wall, established a banking house. Of

course, like all Jews, they origin
ally lived in 
the ghetto in 
Frankfurt
, and they  were 
moneychangers, I guess. That™s, you know, how 
mo st of them started. And th en, I think 
my  grandfather™s grandfather 
Œ that™s my  grandfather, and 
th at™s my great-grandfather. 
Q: Those two pictures up there Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and their Œ mm-hm? 

A: And on my  mo ther™s side. And he
 started a bank, wh ich was called 
L
.
A
. 
Hahn
. And 
all their initials were 
L
.
A
. And it later became a public Œ pu
blicly traded 
bank which was 
called 
Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank
. 
Q: 
Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank
? 
A: Yeah. And, in fact, the house is still st
anding and it™s a historic Œ has a historic 
designation of the bank, but Œ 

Q: So th e ba Œ the bank™s build ing and facility? 

A: Yes, the bank™s building. It™s really ju
st the outside, because the rest was destroyed 
during the war, but the outside 
is still standing. So anyway
, they had a bank. And of 
course you may know th at in 
F ra nkfurt
 there were lots of mixed marriages. 
Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, y
ou know, how was it that your parents even 
met? What brought the Œ bro
ught their worlds together? 
A: I really just don™t know, but Œ but my 
father was Œ my gran dparents ha Œ on my  
father™s sid e had three boys, and my father
 was the youngest. Clearly the apple of my

grandmother™s eye. And he is the only one w
ho went to university, a
nd he had a law Œ he 
got a law degree. And I think he was very 
society minded. And he Œ I Œ I™ll show you 
later upstairs, I have a Œ an ol
d program from something at the 
[indecipherable]
 opera, 
where he danced with  some lady. And I have 
a feeling that that™s how they met, because 
he was really very interested in getting up th
ere somehow. He was also a champion tennis 
player. He was German master 
in 1910, wh ich was a different tennis game from what it is 
now, but nevertheless. 
Q: It™s still something, it™s 
an achievement, you kn
ow, in competition with
 others in your 
area. 
A: Yes, yeah, I Œ I have all the tro phies upst
airs. And he also played the piano very well, 
and he used to accompany singers or play in 
small trios. So I™m Œ I am sure that™s how 
they met somehow, in Œ in a dance, or whatev er.  

Q: What kind of pers
onality did he have? 
A: My fa Œ 
Q: How would you Œ mm-hm, how
 would you describe it? 
A: My father should have been a diplomat. 
He was one of the mo st tactful people I™ve 
ever known, and really was charming. I mean, 
everybody just loved hi
m. And he Œ he just 
Œ he ended up being a banker, be
cause he finally took over my  gran dparents bank. Bu t he 
Œ he should have been  a dipl
omat. He Œ he was not very st
rict, but you know, I Œ I grew 
up at a time that my  parents weren™t home that mu ch, and I had a Œ a wonderful Œ I don™t

know, now you call it nanny, I guess, but it wa
 Œ she was just a young wo man whom they 
hired, and who took care of th
e kids, and did other stuff, too.
 And she is really the one 
who Œ who raised me, more or 
less. Not that I didn™t see my
 parents, I mean, I saw them 
quite a bit, but Œ we always ha
d meals together. We always at
e Œ we used to get the Œ and 
you know, in 
Euro pe 
yo-you eat your main meal at noon, I mean.  
Q: That™s right. 
A: And so we always had that together, but I 
don™t Œ in th e evening they were often gone. 
But, you know, he was a very nice person.  

Q: Now, were you th e oldest child? 

A: No. My  sister was two years older. 
Q: And what™s her name? 
A: Her name was 
Ruth
. 
Q: 
Ruth
. And you th en were born in wh at year? 
A: 
Ruth
. 
Q: Ah, no, 
Ruth
 Œ what year were you born in? 
A: I was born in 1920. 

Q: 1920. And Œ 
A: And she was born 1918. 
Q: 1918. And what I had forgotten to ask 
earlier, your mo ther™s maiden name, and her 
name.

Q: Okay ,

A: And so th en they  Œ you know
, my father, I remember, he is
 Œ at the time I h ad allergic 
eczema, which of course, when I was a child 
they didn™t know it was allergy. And I 
remember my father always at
 night bandaging my  arms, so 
that I wouldn™t scratch, you 
know. But you know, I don™t real
ly know if it was so often. It just Œ your memory just 
plays tricks on you. Anyway , it was Œ it was ve
ry nice. I grew up 
Œ well, my family, I 
guess they had a lot of money, but I didn™t 
really know that, you know? I Œ it never 
occurred to me that I lived diffe
rent from a lot of other people. 
Q: Well, what do you reme mb er about your home;
 both as a physical structure, and about 
the kind of life that you and your f Œ your pa
rents and your sister; and whoever else was 
there, the Œ the young girl who was part of yo
ur household; what was that like? So let™s 
talk about all of it. Describe it a bit. 

A: Well, we lived Œ and later when we™ve fi
nished I™ll show you the pictures, because I 
have pict Œ pictures on the 
wall of Œ of my  Œ I grew up in what used  to be my  
grandparents dairy farm. 
Q: That is your father™s parents?

A: Yes. And it was a regular farm in a 
U-
shape, with the main house on one side, and 
then what used to 
be the barns in a 
U-
shape around it. In the middle was a Œ a well. And 
of course we didn™t have any animals a
ny mo re Œ I mean, we had dogs, but Œ and 
chickens, but not the cows and stuff. So 
we used the barns mainly for garages. 
Q: For what? 
A: For garage. 

Q: Oh yeah. 
A: And also for our bicycles
 and Œ and tools and stuff. 
Q: Did it still look like a farm, or did it look like a villa in the outskirts of town? 

A: No, it looked like a farm. And it 
[indecipherable]
 three acres. And it actually, when I 
grew up, was no longer on the outskirts of Œ of town , it was in town . 

Q: I see, in 
Frankfurt
 itself. 
A: Yes. So it Œ you know, the streetcar was 
a half a block away. So  it Œ then I took th e 
streetcar to go to wo Œ to go 
to school. So  it Œ it was really in the middle of to wn . And th e 
one thing I really regret, it Œ it has been razed 
now, and I regret that because if historic 
preservation had come into life sooner, that 
thing would have stayed , because it™s very 
unusual to have a farm in the middle of Œ 
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ of to wn . 

Q: Of course.

A: But, you know, in any ca Œ in any case, wh
ere Œ the main house, when you faced it, sat  
on the left, and it was really very 
beautiful. It was 
big house, and Œ 
Q: How would you desc
ribe its style, its architectural style? 
A: Hm? 
Q: How would you describe
 its architectural style? 
A: Well, it was just Œ 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Twenty Œ turn
 of the century. 
Q: Okay . 

A: A stucco house. 
Q: Okay , okay. 
A: And it had a Œ a gate in the front, whic
h usually was open because we had cars, but 
you could close the gate, and then  it had a dr
iveway , long driv eway, which led you into  
the courty ard. And next door 
was a boys™ school, wh ich was kind of nice when I grew up. 
But it was really just beautiful, and we had a larg
e, just garden for Œ to
 enjoy, and then we 
had a lot of vegetables, and we
 had chickens. A-An
d Œ and we did have
 a lot of help. I-I 
think we probably had three ma
ids, and Œ and there was, from the Œ across the courtyard 
from the main house, there was th Œ at the 
end of the last barn there was another little 
house, and the Œ I don™t know

an apartment building. He a
nd his wife lived there, and 
you know, he would tend the 
furnace, and do stuff like that. 
Q: So th e ka Œ kind of housekeepers. 
A: Yeah. And Œ and then we ha
d a gardener who lived
 in the same place upstairs, and I Œ 
I think we had three maids and a cook, but I 
can™t Œ yeah , I think we had three maids and 
a cook. So I some
time s wonder wh at my  mo ther did all day, but Œ 
Q: Well, tell me a little bit about her. If I 
asked you about what your father™s personality 
was like, what was hers like? 
A: My mother enjoyed ill health. 

Q: Oh gosh. 
A: Well, she Œ she was Œ I™m sure she had some 
ill health, but if she Œ if she did, I know, 
had a stomach operation early in her marriage.
 I have a feeling it all Œ it had to do with 
nerves too, you know? And th
en  she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I Œ I don™t know 
if it was a h y sterectomy, or something like th
at. And what is very unfortunate, she had a 
surgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted. 
Q: Oh dear. 

A: And she was addicted the rest of her life. 
Q: Oh dear, what a tragedy. 
A: And that was very unfortunate, because sh
e was really a very wonderful person. Bu t 
of course, I was only nine when  this starte
d, so I never really 
knew what a wonderful

person sh e was. I knew it mainly through othe
r people, who told me
 about it. She was, 
you know, she had Œ of course 
had not gone to college, but sh
e was pretty sma rt, and she 
had a lot of common sense. And she was very  
Œ she had a lot of empathy. And I™ll tell 
you a little story, during the 
depression, you know
, in Œ starting in 1930, I guess, when 
there was so much poverty in 
Germany
, she started a so up k
itchen at our house. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And it™s one of my  mo st vivid memo ries
. We Œ the kitchen door was on th e side, and 
the kitchen door had Œ had so
rt of a window you could ra
ise up to the outside. And we 
would have, every day, about 20 people who 
came. After a while, we started giving out 
little slips to people, to say 
which day they could come, a
nd Œ with their name. And I 
know I used to write those slips, which is
 why I remember it so well. And then they 
would co me starting at noon, and our co ok 
would have a big soup, you know, something 
substantial, and bread. And we 
had benches in the courtyard. And if it was raining, we 
put them in the Œ one of the barns. And then 
the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main 
meal, I guess. In fact, we had 
one couple that found each ot
her and got married. And then 
on Christmas, she always had ev erybody come
, and she Œ they got Œ the men got shav ing 
cream and stuff like that, and th
e women got some other stuff. He
 Œ they Œ they all got the 
little bag with goodies. So she really, I mean
, and that was entirely my mother™s make Œ 
doing. 

Q: That™s a very kind thought.

A: And she really, I mean, that™s
 the kind of person sh e was. 
But, of course, the addiction 
was dreadful, because you know, 
a-an addiction to morphine is the same as Œ as a heroin 
addiction, or any other. It™s unpredictable.
 The mood can be Œ one day you think, oh, 
she™s wonderful, and th en you ta
lk a lot, and then the next
 day sh e™s gone again, you 
know. And Œ and she did go
 into rehab twice in 
Germany
, and then it was better for a 
while, but it never lasted. And then  wh en she 
came to this country
 Œ you know, I don™t 
know where she got her morphine. That™s so
metimes the curse of having money. And Œ 
but a Œ it was the same in Œ in 
Tucso n
, where she lived, I mean, 
she Œ and in the end, it 
wa Œ was just awful. But you know, tha- that is Œ that was very sad, really. 
Q: Yeah. And hard for children. 
A: But, you know, it Œ the one thing I Œ I Œ I ha
ve told this to my 
kids from the day they 
were born, in order to make sure that they  stayed away from all drugs, because I told 
them how horrible this is. 

Q: Well, the price that people
 pay. The price that the fam
ily pays, the price that the 
person pays. 

A: It Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s really very sad. But,
 you know Œ and Œ and I

know it was Œ it was her surgeon who got her 
addicted, and he was

of doctors are addicted, I think.

Q: Well, before that happened,
 you would have been nine ye
ars or less, but you mention 
that your parents would go ou
t in the evenings. Di
d they Œ did they en joy each other™s 
company? 
A: Yes, they did. And Œ and, as I think I wa
nt to Œ I mean, they go
t divorced in ™38. I 
think it had na Œ it had absolute
ly nothing to do with
 the fact that my 
mother was Jewish, 
and my father wasn™t. My sister and I saw 
that divorce coming fo r years. Which doesn™t 
mean they weren™t friendly. Th
ey were very friendly, they  always talked to each  other 
and Œ and Œ but, you know, I Œ it™s very hard to
 look at your parents and think about sex. 
Q: That™s true. 
A: But I think it was very Œ th
ey were incompatible. That™s 
what I think, you know, and I 
think that my father wasn™t that
 interested in it, and my moth
er was more interested in it, 
and do I think th at was the basis for the divor
ce. Because she got married again, but Œ to  
the guy that she™d been goi
ng with for years, anyway. 
Q: Did you all know about that? 
A: Oh, yes. Kids always know ev
erything. Kids know everything.

 that was the basis.

other. It™s just, I think in be
d they didn™t mesh. So, you 
know, I me an, yeah, you don™t 
think about that when you™re a child.

these things?

 was gay. In fact, I™m sure he was gay. And

my father at that point, was 
working at a different bank that belonged to

her. And then, in ™34 
or so, I think, they asked my father 
to leave that bank and come to the

 very closely, and of course, he was British

Q: What is it that I wanted to
 ask you now? Ah, at the very
 beginning you mentioned th at 
there were many mixed marriages in 
Frankfurt Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ when your parents got married. Tell me 
a little bit about 
identity, if one can. Was 
your family, your mother™s side
 of the family very Jewish? 
A: No, apparently not. I mean, I Œ  
Q: And how does one define
 not being very  Jewish? 
A: Yeah, I Œ I don™t know. I mean, I all Œ I al
ways knew that my gr
andparents were Jews, 
and that my mo ther was Jewish by heritage
. Which, I know a lot of other girls I knew 
who were in the same boat did not know, 
and were absolutely shocked in ™33. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. I knew several of them, where they ju
st never knew that they had any connection 
to Jews. My gran dparents, I don™t know th at 
they ever went to s
ynagogue, but I know 
Yom Kippur seemed to fall ma
inly during farm vacations, and we often spent our farm 
vacations at my grandparents™ house in 
Königstein
, and my  grandmother always locked 
herself into a bedroom on Yom Kippur, and sa
id she was fasting. Now, my  cousin, and 
we always said, well, she™s got the cupboa

fasting, but I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah.

thing. 
Q: In the house. 
A: Yeah. So they Œ as I said, 
my  mo th er™s y o ung est 
sister, I think was a devout Jew, but I 
never knew her. And now Œ 
Q: So the fact that your parents came from di fferent Œ now, was your father™s family 

Lutheran, or Catholic? 
A: German Reformed. 
Q: Oh, German Reformed
, okay, so Protestant. 
A: Which is much better than Lutheran
, and has nothing to do with Catholic.  
Q: No, it has nothing to do with Catholic. 

A: I Œ I tell you, German Re
formed  was a small group in 
Frankfurt
, which had been 
persecuted in the late 1800s. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yes, and we Œ our church  Œ and I was brou

you couldn™t see from the outsi
de that it was a church, it just
 looked like a house. Had no 
stained glass windows, no towe
r, no bell, no nothing. But inside
 there was a real church. 
And it was a small congregation. My father 
was very active in it after the war, I don™t 
know. He and my  sister got into  religion, a

I got. And so  there were a lot of old 
F ra n kfurt
 families that belonged to the German 
Reform. There™s also French Reform, but Œ 
wh ich came from the Huguenots, you know. 
Q: Ah, okay. 
A: There were a lot of Huguenots that came from 
France
 to the 
Frankfurt 
area, and 
there Œ you find a lot of Fren

always had Christmas, and my  mothe

 to be on the 25
th
 of 
December. 

Q: Oh, th e poor thing.
 No double presents. 
A: Yeah. And my  daughter™s on the 23

. And I remember that my
 grandparents used to 
come for her birthday, and we always got Ch

of Hanukkah, anything like that. So, at Œ some
how they  Œ they had sort of embraced my  
fam Œ my father™s family, a
nd Œ and I don™t know, and I 
think a lot of those mixed 
marriages in

it was highly unusual, highly unusual. Be Œ 
it was different societies, yeah. 
A: Yeah Œ no, in 
F rankfurt
 it was every day, you know. 
Q: Did you see yourself as Christian? Did 
you have any feeling 
of being Ch ristian? 
A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, si
nce Œ since we seemed to be mo re on my  
father™s religion, I went to confirmation cl
ass, I was confirmed in the German Reform 
church. And then I married my husband. And he
 didn™t want to have anything to  do with  
religion, period, because he said he can™
t believe that any G

happened , you know. So, he sa

never going to Œ in terested anything. 
Q: You™re talking about yo
ur daughter™s children? 
A: My daughter™s three boys. 
The middle boy Œ the tw o older ones are in college, and my  
daughter has said to them, you know, you are 
Bar Mitzvahed, and y

A: 1933.

that my  parents made, I Œ I Œ I mentioned 
earlier that my moth

taking o Œ my  mo ther is one of the very

therefore didn™t really think about my school
. I mean, I do Œ I don™t blame her, you know, 
when  you™re sick, you™re sick. So 
anyway, they sent me to pub

school where you™ve been.

now; on Easter, after Easter, 
that™s when the new year star
ts. And that was pretty soon 
after 
Hitler
 took over, and I think they just neve
r thought. In any case, I went to that 
school, and there was one a Œ one more half-Jew
ish girl in the class,
 and one girl who was 
a full Jew, and the rest were not. The other ha
lf-Jewish girl, unfortuna
tely her last name 
was 
Solo mon
, wh ich of course, a mu ch 
more Jewish name than 
Bartmann
 was. And we 
had a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi. 
And so me of the other teachers were too, 
and of course, some of the girls were. And it was not always pleasant. There Œ I Œ I did 
have two or three friends, or four sa Œ mo re ev

still alive, like I am. S h e lives in

 But part of it, I think, was 
because my mother had left 
Germany
 at the end of ™34, I think. 
Q: Is that when she left the home? 
A: Yes. That™s when she went to

my  sister had gone to  board ing school, so
 I was home alone with
 my father, who was 
very lenient, and I did what I wanted to do
. Not homework for sure

England
 to this boarding school, where 
every minute of the day is programmed.

 well the bedroom was for all the girls, at 7:30 in the

 not allowed to come back 
til the evening. You have to 
take everything you have to have, with you

there for one year. Nobody had asked me if I 
wanted to go, but I went. And then, after the 
year, they decided I would go to  
Swit zerla n d
 to learn French. Now th

bathrooms, which you shared with a milli

had a bath room wh ere you could lock the doo

there were many girls from

there were three Americans Œ no, there were
 four Americans. And then the rest was 
different. One girl was from 
Haifa

Q: Well it Œ yes, very little known. 
A: Œ and a lot of the kids, I think, went to 
South America
 from there. 
Q: I see.

 then as part of the

A: Yes. He Œ he was sent to Œ I don™t know, hi Œ first to 
England

came over, he was Œ he was in 
Belgium
 during the Battle of the 
Bulge, but, you know, he 
was not fighting, he Œ he was just there, a
nd Œ and he said it was very unpleasant. I™m 
sure it was. And then he Œ then he wa Œ 
actually, I met him when
 he was discharged, 
because, you know, a lot of 
G

took a discharge in 
Euro pe
 and then took a contract 
with what was then called the war departme
nt. And he had a contract with the war 
department to work at the military  government 
in denazification, and I happened to be in 
that department. 

Q: And that™s how you met? 
A: And he took my  desk, and I didn™t like 
it. But, you know, that™s an old story. 
Q: So Œ 
A: That Œ that Œ that™s all we needed, this guy here. 
Q: Right. So your children at le

A: Yeah, they do Œ they

the military government. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah, it™s such a Œ 
Q: All right. Is there anything th at 
you think we haven™t talked about? 
A: I think Œ 
Q: Is there anything that you™d want to add 
about let™s say, the new da Œ denazification 
department? Or do you think we
 pretty mu ch covered it? Your dog is impatient, she 
wants some attention.  

A: Well, it was interesting to
 work at the military gove
rn ment, you know. I™ve work ed 
first 
[indecipherable]
 I worked first in a different depa
rtment. When we were first hired 
Œ I mean, was right away. I mean, 
as I told you, my father Œ 
Q: That™s right, was asked. 

A: Œ was there, and I said, let™s see if we ca
n™t Œ if I can™t get there, because I wasn™t 
going back to that doctor. 
Q: The one you don™t know. 
A: Right. And so  he said yes, yes, yes, they
 said come and see, and so I was hired right 
away, and with another girl wh
om I didn™t know, but whom I 
met. And then, just as the 
war ended, they fired us all, becau se they go
t Belgian girls, who were, of course, allies, 
and so all German girls were fired, and fo
ur weeks later they go and hired us back, 
because the Belgian girls, they
 didn™t work out. So, you kn
ow, I was home for four weeks

and then  they Œ they  called and said, would I 
come back, you know. So I went back, and I 
worked first in supply
, which was very interesting beca
use the sergeant in supply, his 
name was 
Valna
(ph) 
Hirschman
(ph), and he was from 
F r a n kfurt
, which he didn™t 
really want to tell y Œ tell you. Bu t he was 
Œ he was a nice guy, I me an, and we Œ we 
worked mostly in the warehous
e, where they had, you know, 
staples of supplies, like food 
and stuff, and rats, too. But he was very 
nice, because every Fr
iday, he gave us a 
package, a care packag e to take home. And believe me, 
the time rig h t after the war was 
the mo st difficult one, as far as food and Œ 
and heating goes. I mean, there wasn™t any 
food, and there was no coal to
 heat. So it was Œ fortunately 
[indecipherable]
 the military 
government, and met somebody who had co al, so
 we were able to get some coal, but it Œ 
the food was really very, very sh ort, 
and I got lunch every 
day at the military 
government. They had a canteen
 and th ey fed all of us. Lot of creamed corn, and Œ but 
that™s okay, I mean Œ and 
Spam
. But, you know, wh
en  you™re hungry, you™re happy to 
eat anything.
 
Q: That™s right. 
A: So I worked there in supp
ly for quite a long time and Œ a
nd I also went with  this one 
sergeant; he had to insp ect
 all the boats on the 
Main
 river. So we went Œ I Œ I always 
remember, we had a very nice trip, he was a 
nice guy, I really enjo
yed him. And once we 
went someplace to inspect the boat, and we cam
e to a military sentry
 or something, and

 you couldn™t 
get Œ you couldn™t take her in. It 
was some secret stuff, you know Œ 
Q: Right.

then, after that I was transferred to the 
denazification. 

Q: I see, okay. 

A: At Œ the same thing Œ in the same build

worked for a Captain

Q: Yeah. 
A: And then  
Morrison 
left and my  husband came. 
Q: And what was your job there?

 translation of documents, or Œ 
A: Translation of documents, and Œ no, not in
