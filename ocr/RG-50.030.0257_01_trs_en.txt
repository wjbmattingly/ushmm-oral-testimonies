May 10, 1991 
 
Question:  Would you please us your na
me  and where and when you were born? 
 
Answer:  Uh my na me  is Norbert Wolheim, born on April 26th, 1913 in Berlin, Germany. 
 
Question:  Ca n you describe your childhood and young adulthood in Berlin? 
 
Answer:  Well uh I...my fa mily was a closely-knitt
ed family and my father, bless his memory, 
was uh uh a commissioned salesman and he had 
uh developed his own 
business before World 
War I when he was called into se
rvice and the business then had to
 be closed.  My mot her, bless 
her me mory, was a housewife and she took care of us
 during the time when my father went away 
to war.  I was only one and a year year...one and a 
half years old when he left us to serve in 
France and in Russia with the German army.  He 
was a me mber of the me dical corps, and when 
he came back in 1919 or so, after 
the end of the war, my mother 
always told me  that uh I had 
difficulties to to to greet him as a son because he
 had become a stranger to me because he had 

been away for so ma ny years, and I grew up duri
ng the time  of uh the Weimar (ph) Republic.  I 
had an elder...an older sister.  Uh our parent
s saw to it that we ha
d a good education and though 
uh we we longed...belonged to a called...would ca
ll it here to the mi ddle _____ families, uh and 
things were tough in economi cal terms uh a fter the war, during the inflation and later the 

Depression, but uh as I say our pare
nts saw to it that we had a so
lid education, a solid uh general 
education and also a solid Jewish 
education, so we all...my sister a
nd I, we went to a to a to a 
upper eleme ntary schools to high schools.  My si
ster to a Jewish high school.  I was in a non-
Jewish high school where in these years over th
ere uh since I...we had not too ma ny Jewish uh 
children, I met a certain amount of anti-Semitis
m but not uh militant  anti-Semitism but it was 
you called more kind of cultural an
ti-Semitism but uh uh we ma naged. 
 

Question:  Could you describe that a little 
bit, what you mean by cultural anti-Semitism?  
 
Answer:  Well, that we we
re not included in the huma
n...you had you had groups uh who who 
did certain things, uh whether be 
it in sport or socially, and so
 I was not invited.  I was not 
invited so it I didn't suffe r from that, especially
 not when I, after my bar mitzvah, I joined the 
Jewish Youth Moveme nt and which asserted me  of
 my Jewish values and my Jewish heritage 
because that was also some how I 
would say a turn in my life b
ecause I became uh active in that  
group.  I was thirteen, fourteen 
years old, and uh it was a group 
uh uh which was believing in the 
uh in in political  and ideological terms in a s
ynthesis between uh Germa ns and Jews.  In other 
words it was a non-Zionist move me nt.  The uh major value of this was that you me t the people 

who had uh were devoted towards this idealism a nd hoping for a new world, for a better world, 
and the working ______ that go by working on yourself
.  That means in educational terms uh we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
2 
 
we we uh read.  We  were at this time infl
uenced I reme mber by writings of Martin _________, 
__________,  studying the bible, studyi
ng our history...uh which as I say it was a very special 
value, but also uh uh by by trying to uh to ma ke a 
contribution we did a lot of call it social work, 
which means taking care of needy uh uh children,
 especially uh uh children of our age in 
distress.  We worked with them.  We we we we 
invited them.  We  we tried to help them.  We 
tried to allevi ate their problems by just show
ing that we are there for them and for them, 
especially for children who came out from broke
n home s, who had who had uh a brush with the 
law and so on, so that we considered them as uh 
a s  people who had to be saved and this was part 
of our work between our contri
bution to try to help them, a
nd uh this was I would say very 
important because there we esta
blished personal friendships, uh gi
rls and boys and and uh we we 
we we followed the principle of Boy Scouts.  We
 we we discovered nature.  We  were hiking.  
We stayed overnight in tents and we
 enjoyed the beauty of
 of of of nature.  But at the same  ti me  
we had very interesting evenings 
in discussions.  People had to be 
prepared to deliver let us say a 
lecture about whatever the subject matter was, be
 it literature, philosophy, 
or whatever it is and 
Jewish and German kings or whatnot...general thi
ngs, and that that was very, very attractive for 
all of us and and it gave us a certain sense of fu
ture responsibility.  I would not say leadership 
but responsibility and 
therefore whatever... 
 

Question:  We need you to stop..._____________.  They'r e 
not getting quite the angle they want.  
_______ 

 
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 
 
Question:  Li nda is asking me  to have you pers
onalize what you're sa
ying a little more, how you 
as an individual experienced what's  ha
ppening.  Uh did you have
 a good friend in the 
Movement?   What your favorite e
xperience that you recall from
 those days?   Did you have a 
leadership role, rather than a ge
neral, more of a...from your own ey
es is what they'r e looking for, 
and also uh if you could, more 
about your fa mily, talk about 
that.  Also I don't think you 
me ntioned the name  of t he move me nt, so when 
the tape starts again, you probably need to  
_______________.   

 
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 
 
Question:  Would you continue 
to describe the the youth moveme nt, its name  and what you 
personally got out of it? 

 
 
Answer:  Well the name  us first the 
called ________________, which is the German-Jewish 
Youth uh uh Alliance and later 
called _______, the Association of Jewish Youth, and and uh 
what I got out of it was that uh I found people of
 my age and and my call it mentality and and uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

my ideals and we we we uh worked together.  We
 me t actually during the 
week almost twice or 
three times on evenings.  We  me t over the weeke
nds.  We  we  were hiking uh in the area around 
Berlin which is beautiful and uh then as I saywe  uh we were really ca
ll it enriching ourselves 
with with knowledge which which came  about
 by exchanging news, by by putting pe ople to 
work let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or 
whatever it is in whatever the area wa s.  At the 
same  ti me  I would not uh uh mi nimi ze the influe
nce of my of my parents on on on me.  We 
uh...my father, bless his me mory, came from a very
 traditional home in in
 the eastern part of 
Germany, from Posen (ph).  He had a very basi
c Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not 
orthodox but very conservative.  Uh uh we observe
d the holy days certainly uh and uh especially 
during the holy days we saw the 
fami lies and and friends and then 
uh my father and after the war 
as a veteran became active in the Jewish Wa r Ve
terans uh uh moveme nt, also doing social work 
for needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed me
mory, joined the auxilia
ries there and so we 
all...and my sister certainly was al
so active, so we were all active 
in in one kind of Jewish affairs 
or the other, but there was one
 day or one evening when all 
this...when when we assemb led 
around the uh the uh family table and that was Fr
iday evening.  Certainly having kiddish (ph) 
and having the Friday meal and having having the 
relatives uh who joined us, but ma inly after 
that then people were dropping in for coffee and cak
e and then then the th
e events of the week 
and the events of the day were discussed and I got 
out a lot from that because first of all it was a 
wonderful family...fa mi l y uh uh atmosphere in sp
ite of all the difficulti
es we had around us 
because the diff...the economi cal si
tuation in Germany during the in
flation and then at the time  
of the Depression was not easy, bu
t there was a wa rmth of a of a Jewish home  which which I 
appreciated very much and I think formed me  an
d and and therefore my my my rightful fa mily 
and my my love for fa mily, it came fr om there uh a
nd which was held up in all as I say in all...in 
spite of all di ffi culties.  My father worked hard 
to make a living uh but on Friday night as they 
say in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that
 on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this 
this was reflected uh in the observance of the ritu
als and then also in in
 a social way and uh uh 
that was known to us so and there there were no i
nvitations sent out.  People just dropped in and 
we were happy to have them and sha r ed with 
them whatever we had.  Uh and uh in the youth 
move me nt, not only did we do uh uh intellectual 
work and educational work but certainly uh 
they developed ties with
 with friends and I must say that
 for for...over the years these ties 
became very...have rema ined very close, up to toda
y.  They are not too many people left survive, 
but some  of them I I went to together to Auschw
itz and I lost them, but uh especially I must say 
when I came  for the first time on a on a visit to
 this...to America.  I was sent by the United 
Jewish Appeal in 1946 to this country to bring the me ssage of the su
rvivors to to to the American 
Jewry.  I me t some  of my old friends of that 
time and uh it was interesti
ng that we could...as if 
nothing had happened in between.  Th
ese ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and 
time.  We got together again, i
rrespective of our changed political
 orientation in ma ny a time or 
ideological orientation, but this ti
e...these personal ties were st
rong ties and have rema ined uh uh 
and I would say still today for 
ourselves, the old guard, we get 
together whenever we can and 
and this has remained.  I also met my  first 
wife in the youth moveme nt.  We were very young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

and uh and developed a relationshi
p and and later uh uh we got ma rri
ed in Berlin, so uh it it was 
uh a time which which some how for med us in in 
in a certain way and I 
would say that my uh 
devotion to uh to uh, if I ma y say so, to uh things
 outside of personal interest, to do some thing 
for the community, to do some thing for...t
o ma ke it...try to ma ke a contribution uh 
was...originated from the fact that I saw it in 
the house of my  parents who had dedicated their 
their time and life to certain thi
ngs within these limits of thei
r possibility, and later uh in the 
youth move me nt where we were educated in th
e belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for 
yourself.  You have to try also to uh to uh to
 do some thing for people who who are less lucky 
than you are or or need your help and and and support. 
 
Question:  And until what age did you stay in the youth move ment? 
 
Answer:  Actually I stayed in the youth move...y
outh move ment as long as it existed, because in 
1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo.  Uh we 
tried but in in spite...in other words they 
did not allow us to to continue
 uh to to operate.  Certain othe
r groups were still allowed to 
operate till 1938.  We  we re not.  In 1935 as I say,
 uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that 
uh uh we we uh kept our contacts. 
 In other words, what we did 
was then that we we decided 
_______.  Every week we had birthday celebrati
ons.  We  came to...got together and uh well 
certainly under the Nazi time things had change
d completely with uh our approach to...or our 
thinking in political and ideological terms change
d.  Uh there came a time when we came to the 
conclusion that that there is no future for for fo
r Jews in Germany and we should help to prepare 
young people to get out of Ger ma
ny, especially in the years 1940...1935, '36 when slowly but 
surely uh we we did understand that uh uh uh the Nazi
 regime was there to stay, that it was not a 
transitory uh thing, and that uh 
uh uh uh there was, as I said, no 
future for for...especially for 
young people. So uh uh if you want to...I've never 
left the the the ______ Youth Moveme nt.  It 
it's still in me  some how and uh interes
ting enough, this is some thing which...a 
pheno...phenome non which is not only restricted to
 Germany.  When I speak with my friends 
from the east, uh there was also something 
that they called the youth move me nt and it's  
interesting when you meet
 the people who are who are came out of that, they have a certain 
special approach to to the Jewish
 community and to to life whic
h I share very much with them. 
 
Question:  Ye s.  Can you begin to describe now
 about Hitler's  rise to power and how that 
affected you and and the Jewish _____ in the early '30's?  
 
Answer:  Well, uh uh this is a loaded question uh
 because certainl y in the '20's uh uh the Nazi uh 
uh party became  stronger and stronger.  There 
we re differences of opinion...would they last, 
would they not last, but uh give
n the political weakness of the We imar Republic which was not 
uh uh able to enamor itself to the to the people, 
the fact that the uh democ r atic parties and the 
social demo crats lost mo re and more in influe
nce...uh uh we we...in spite of all that we thought 
that the Republic would do...the We imar Republic
 uh representatives would do some thing to try 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
5 
 
to stop the move me nt.  They were not able 
to do it, so you had 
certainly a...during the 
Depression you had millions of unemployed and 
Hitler was uh uh able to...and his he nchmen...to 
capitalize on that and uh in
 addition to that that 
certainly  there was a na
tionalistic feeling that uh 
Germany ha d not lost the war but
 was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was 
not defeated but was was uh defeated by the 
so-called home - front, which means by social 
democrats and communists and the Jews.  Uh sin
ce we had our own Jewish values, I would say, 
it didn't affect us what the Nazi were were we
re were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other 
hand we were no doubt concerned what will 
what will ha ppen in political terms. One 

consideration was that uh uh if Hitler should tr
y to come  to power, the uh the uh powers around 
Germany...England, France, Czechoslovakia, 
Poland...would never...and Russia...would never 
allow him to do so but this was certainly an illusi
on as we learned later, a
nd irrespective of that 
uh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried 
to uh uh participate as ac
tively as we could still 
in the cultural life of of
 Berlin which was in this respect a w
onderful city.  It was leading in the 
in the area of music, theater, literature, and so
 on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to 
participate to the best of our ability.  In 1938...'
31, I graduated from high school and I entered the 
University of Berlin to study law and econom
ics and as students we had certain, certain 
privileges which...not privileges but certain uh when
 we went to the theater or the opera, it was 
for very cheap money and we we we uh it was then 
still an accepted fact that we participated 
fully as Germans in this life, last not least due 
to the fact that in this cultural life you had ma ny 
uh leading Jewish personalities.  After all, in a 
city like Berlin...it was a c
ity of Einstein, in the 
field of music of _____ and Otto (ph) ______ and a
nd and so and and say we uh we uh we really 
uh enjoyed it.  Still we we were concerned a
bout the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a 
democratic way, uh were able to 
uh to uh add to their power becaus
e when it came to voting they 
increased their seats in the in th
e Parliame nt, especially
 in the years of 1
931 and 1932.  Uh life at 
the University, for instance, already was also 
influenced by the...reme mbe r that, you know, there 
was there wa s uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the lobby of the 
University in Berlin, Jewish groups, the the le
ftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not 
leftists...democratic groups, but al
so the Nazis and that didn't take
 long and uh there were brawls 
and there was fighting and so and since the Univers
ity was ex-t erritorial , uh they didn't allow the 
police to interfere so it was very
 unpleasant but the uh cl
asses and also the classes of the Jewish 
professors, were not actually affect
ed, at least not in Berlin.  Ther
e was cases in Bressler (ph) we 
know where they where they tried 
to disturb classes and so on, but
 not in Berlin and uh uh on the 
other hand uh also amongst the students it was take
n up, amongst the intellectuals who originally 
________ very much fr om the conservative groups
 of Ger many, who had never become  uh uh uh 
engaged in the principles of the We imar Republic or democratic principles.  Uh there was no real 

rebirth.  I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in Ge rmany did not become  a real fundame ntal 
political system, and uh e specially these thes
e uh nationalistic conserve
...conservative groups 
called _________, they uh were uh...they produced most 
of t he students.  Also due to the fact 
that uh uh then education became a monopoly of th
e of the uh more wealthier democracy in in 
Germany.  There was not enough done in order to ge
t people also out of less wealthier groups of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
6 
 
the of the of the progressi ve let us say, so we had our our our diffi culties and still uh irrespective 
we we did our work as st udents and uh and uh th
en when Hitler ca me  to power on January 30th, 
1933...I remember that day very well.  I was a stud
ent then and I had taken my classes and then 
all of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been
 called in to office by the German President.  
Now I want to emphasize that uh this was done in
 a very democratic way, which me ans that uh 
that there wa s no uprising.  I didn't see...I reme mb
er in Berlin when I 
came home from from the 
University, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in Berlin.  Just the 
other way around the Nazis 
prepared for the tremendous torchlight procession
 they they they had organized for Hitler on on 
the evening, and there was no opposition.  Uh to
 emphasize in a very democratic way which 
means that that uh and this was the shock we 
had that he ha d actually succeeded in ki lling 
democracy in Germany with a means of de mocracy. 
 Uh at the beginning in the first couple of 
days uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies 
and the militants amongst th
e Nazis, especially 
the Brown Militia then tried to take revenge 
against their opponents, 
but uh I luckily was not 
affected uh but we heard there was quite a number 
of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get 
even with their political
 opponents, especially social democrat
s, democrats and so on.  And there 
were a lot of acts of violence and we tried to fo
llow up on it and to report
 it to the police.  In 
certain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at th
is time  Nazifi ed completely tried to help uh 
but also they...but slowly this 
this this uh disappeared.  So 
uh after a certain while uh this 
uh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the 
Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh 
accepted the power more  in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the ______ 
uh and obviously it's my  opinion that the Nazis 
had an act of _____.  They promulgated very 
stringent laws taking away th
e uh the basic rights of peopl
e uh and uh then I came to the 
conclusion that most probably to continue studies 
at the University for law or of law uh would uh 
would not guarantee me  any future.  After Apr
il 1st, 1933, certain uh laws were promulgated 
whereby doctors and _____, uh Jewish doctors, Je
wish doctors, lost th
eir license, with the 
exception of those who had served as veterans 
in World Wa r I, and since my father was uh 
uh...had seen action in World Wa r I in France and in
 Russia, I was entitled to continue uh with 
my studies, but as I say I did...came to the conc
lusion that uh this would not guarantee me  a 
future, not in Germany, so then in uh in uh Apri
l-May I I stopped with my
 studies and I uh got...I 
was volunteering in in some  kind 
of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth 
move me nt, the work done...especially the social wo
rk being done was always connected with the 
Jewish community.  The Jewish community in Berlin was a a very well-organized entity and had 

departments for the care from the cradle to the 
grave, I would say.  Uh uh babies' homes and old 
age homes and so on, and we had a special departme nt also for youth work and we were uh 

associated with that group.  Don't forget the 
Jewish community in Berlin uh uh consists of 
approxima tely two and one half thousand me mbe r s.  There wa s a certain tax system under which 

people paid uh like they paid thei
r income tax, they paid their 
Jewish taxes, and the Jewish 
community financed all the activit
ies out of these funds.  In add
ition certainly there was certain 
private donations.  So uh what I did was then I 
uh I became more active in in in this work, 
looking for some thing else but then in 19...and my 
my my family uh was  not personally affected 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
7 
 
though it was more difficult for my for my father to
 continue his work as a commissioned agent.  
On the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're  hear this...uh one of the 
things Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a ne
w order.  My my father, for instance, had come  
home  with his decorations, his Iron Cross wh
ich was considered...was...he cherished it very 

much, so then one of the things Hitler did in 
'33 was to establish a a 
special me dal for those 
people who had seen active service at the front, 
and my father was a beneficiary of that which 
means that even Jews who had served in World Wa
r I also got this decora
tion, in the name  of the 
Fuhrer, absurd as it ma y sound today.  So uh...and 
uh since most of the customers my fa ther had 
were non-Jews, I mean t his decoration which you c
ould display in a certain way, helped him so 
he was still accepted as a as a German, if you 
want to, because at th
is time there were no 
Jewish...special Jewish 
______ or some thing like.  That came la
ter.  But things uh things uh...and 
then interesting enough uh some how by his force
...by his...by introduction 
of certain uh laws 
alleviating the economical hardships and certain
ly the rearma me nt on whi c h Germany started, 
the economy some how improved, uh believe it or not.  
And uh things also in this respect became  
some how easier for my father and and he didn'
t bad...do badly, to the same extent that uh you 
can say that Jewish business did not
...I mean certain of them clos
ed but Jewish business, retail 
stores and so on continued to exis
t.  Depart...Jewish department st
ores continued to exist and had 
a...benefitted from the improveme nt  of that situ
ation and especially when it came  to 1936 when 
we had the Olympic Games in Berlin, then the 
Nazis for propaganda reasons certainly stayed 
away from any from any hostile activities and 
so on.  Also because in connection with the 
political developments, the Nazis uh very gradua
lly uh tightened the screws .  In other words, 

they they didn't start with the Holocaust immediately. 
 It it was that they th
ey started to feel their 
way around.  They had to establish they have po
wer.  After they had taken care of all the 
opponents, the communists and the social democ r ats, 
the democrats, then they they they they uh 
uh felt that they were independently powerful a
nd didn't have to listen to uh to uh any anybody 
else and in in this this gave them then also uh 
as we all know unfortunately a power to to stre...to 
stretch their muscles in in international terms. 
 In other words, the expectation we had that 
eventually the powers like France, England and so
 forth resist, evaporated.  Especially we had 

_____ started to ma rch into the Rhineland (ph) 
and uh though...we have learne
d this later...the uh 
German ar my was was uh uh under the order to retu
rn if if there should 
be resistance, uh and 
they had no heavy weapons for that, but neither the 
French or the British resisted.  France at this 
time already...they had one of their crises so uh so
 Hitler was successful and when he felt that his 
power was growing also in interna
tional terms, then slowly the party also came to the conclusi on 
that that more should be done in order to ex
clude Jews from public
 life and from from 
economical life, uh especially 
after the uh the uh the uh Olym
pic Ga me s.  I, in 1935, seeing 
some how the signs that the war and and we also in our groups who had believed in our future in 

Germany ca me  to the conclusion that we had to 
change our our our approach, that whatever we 
can do we should do to help people to uh to to ge
t out of Germany, and a l so for those who live, 
as I say for one reason or the other,
  didn't or didn't  want to go to
 Palestine, to other countries.  
There were certain uh agricultural educationa l center
s established to give those people who let us 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

say thought to go to South America or to North 
America and and enter ag
ricultural lif
e in these 
countries, to give them the tools and the educatio
n.  In 1935, as I said, I I entered a firm which...a 
Jewish firm...which was active in the export-import
 business, especially in me tals and and ore, 
doing business with Sweden. 
 
LONG PAUSE IN TAP E 
 
...so that pe ople hopefully will learn some thing. 
 
Question:  _______.  It was interesting to me  that
 as people get older and they reme mber all 
these things fr om early on in thei r lives, it mean
s that nothing is ever lost .  It's all in ther e 
some where.  It's  just not easily retrieved. 
 
Answer:  Yes.  And certain people don't 
forget one _____, you know.  They cannot live _______ 
me mory.  I I think ________ had this when we we
re checking people in connection with __ of 
that trial I had against ________.  They give th
ese millions of ____ and we brought the people in 
to check them out and I said well, fo
r instance, where in Auschwitz,  _____________ 
 
TAPE INAUDIBLE  
 
Question:  OK.  You can start again. 
 
Answer:  In 1935 I joined a firm, a J e wish 
firm, uh _______ firm in the import-export business 
specializing in metal trade and ore trade.  Th
is firm had excellent business contacts with 
England, Sweden, France and the eastern countries
, so it was my hope that when I would join 
that firm, I could establish also some  kind of a 
contact in order to find a way out.  I was working 
there as a kind of an admi nistrative assist ant.  
I didn't love that my little work too mu ch, but it 
was alright because I still at this time uh uh rema
ined active to...in in in in Jewish affairs, 
especially with the Jewish community and youth 
work.  Uh for instance, the Jewish community 
at this time  had developed a program which wa s 
interesting.  Since we couldn't have Jewish 
summer camps any mo re in Germany, uh the man w
ho was my youth leader at that certain time  
was very active and innovative, had establis
hed contact with Sweden and Denmark and had 
asked the Jewish communities there to accomm
odate Jewish children from Ger many during the 
summer, and they responded favorably.  In De
nmark, for instance, they uh had uh established 
special special summer camps near Copenhage
n where they took hundred
s of Jewish children 
from Ger many to spend the summer there, whic
h was very pleasant and in Sweden interesting 
enough, the Jewish community in Malmer (ph)
 and Stockholm organized a a program taking 
Jewish childr en into Jewish families during the su mmer and uh I was able to accompany these 

transports, so I had a first...I got a first 
uh uh uh experience how to handle these kind of 
transports and then certainly when we went to
 Sweden and Denmark, we also uh certainly got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

fa miliar with the families and with the organi
zations, so we thought th
at some how would be 
helpful if if if need be.  And uh so these were al
so the years where let me 
say that uh in spite of 
the Nuremb urg Laws which which were established 
in in then made it clear that Jews couldn't 
me mbers of the of the German __________, German
 people and uh uh created the uh the uh laws 
about racial racial uh associati
ons and so in other words uh for
...were forbidding the marriage of 
Jews and non-Jews and certainly we we we uh 
we...I wouldn't say we accepted this but on the 
other hand we also said it doesn't  affect us in 
our Jewish attitude, in 
our in our...in the judgment 
what our Jewish values were.  We ...and I can say 
also personally...I said 
the Nazis cannot tell me  
what kind of a human be ing I am.  I'm a Jew and pr
oud of it.  I will not and 
cannot  deny that that 
Germany, German culture, German language, fo
rmed my my my my uh formed my my 
intellectual being, but th
e Nazis have no uh...even if they do this, if they consider Jews as 
second-class huma n beings, it doesn't affect me  
because I'm I 'm I'm proud...and that as I say, the 
uh the uh education in the in my home and in 
the youth move me nt had given me  that certainty 
that that I didn't feel offe nded by 
it.  What I felt influenced by 
it, certainly did not develop any 
inferiority complex, or any inferiority complex, 
so and then came  1936 were the Olympic Ga me s 
where where all political radi cal activities in Ge
rmany ca me  t o a certain halt in order to to 
present to the world the best face Germany c
ould show.  And as you probably know, also the 
American team which came to Ger many was very 
much affected.  The head of the team, Mr. 
Brundige (ph), uh uh did not ma ke a favorable
 impression on me  when he when he uh uh 
developed this kind of closeness with the Nazis 
and and certainly when this happened with Jesse 
Owens and and and Hitler was uh treating him the 
way he did, we were I 
cannot say glad but it 
it...we were we were glad that
 the world saw what what Nazi
sm and the racial superiority 
com....and r acial superior ity complex meant to them.  Then in the years '37, '38, uh when Hitler 
felt that his power was growing and that also th
e uh German army got got stronger,  uh and uh 
the the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion 
that there should be more
 radical solutions as 
far as the Jews are concerned a
nd they could then _____ slowly feel
 that uh they tried to exclude 
Jews more e ffectively from all ways of life and 
and especially in '38 I reme mber uh departme nt 
stores, retail business and so on were...went more  
and more into the hands of non-Jews.  They 
called it ___________, which means very often under 
under pressure people had to sell their 
business and...but it was still done more or less in 
a certain...in a certain legal way.  Uh until then 
we uh we uh uh uh in '38, in I think in September, I lost my position with that firm because this 

firm also had to change ownership, was for
ced to change the ownership and all Jewish 
employees lost their positions, I myself incl
uded, and uh then I already had came to the 
conclusion that I should try my best uh to to tr
y to get out.  I got ma rri
ed in 1938, in summer of 
1938.  Things in Berlin were not pleasant becau
se before I got ma rried in front of a big 

synagogue in in Berlin, _________, there were certain 
riots against Jewish uh 
Jewish retail stores 
and department stores.  They smashed windows. 
 They attacked the people walking the big 
streets in Berlin so was...there was a question 
even whether we could have the uh the ceremony 
in the synagogue or not.  But uh then this somehow uh uh died down and and I got ma rried in the 

summer of 1938 to the to the to
 the lady I me t in the youth mo veme nt and uh we uh uh uh and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
10 
 
lost her in 1943 when when we were deported to 
Auschwitz, but that's  another chapter.  And we 
all tried then strongly to get out
.  I...we were we were we 
were registering under the quota 
system at the American Consul
ate for instance and my...and I felt 
a responsibility also to do 
some thing for my my parents.  My father coul
d not continue anymore with his activities in 
the...after November '38 and so we were...he was 
drawn into...also into the forced labor groups in 
Berlin doing doing construction work and so on, so 
he was on in years but he was still...he was a 
strong ma n and he was able to uh to ma nage and 
I decided to to try to do some thing to offer 
when I got out, because  I knew with studies of
 law, economi cs, I couldn't establish a position 
outside wherever it would be, and uh the Jewish
 community again as a place where where where 
needs were me t of the of the Jewish population, 
had developed a lot of vocational training uh uh 
courses and I decided to participate in a cour
se for welding, for _____ welding.   I uh...it was a 
couple of months, and since I had lost  my position 
I had the time to do that, and uh I must say I 
some how established...uh I got to
 like it because uh uh some  work
 with your hands which which 

which I found interesting, especially ordinary 
me tal, me tal welding and so on.  Never was an 
expert, but at least that saved my life  some ho
w.  So uh uh and then we uh we uh in No...in 
October of 1938, uh my wife's parents had come
 from the east, came from Poland, and as a 
ma tter of fac t  they still spoke Yiddish.  My wife
, born in Berlin, my first wife born in Berlin 
went to a German school so she knew both Ge
rman and Yiddish and in in October 1938 the 
German government got into a di spute with the Polish government because the Polish 

governme nt was was not very friendly to Jews
, very reactionary and almost anti-Semitic, 
accepted a law that uh the passports of people li
ving outside of Poland had to be rene wed, but 
that the passport of Jews living, for instance, 
in Germany, would not be
 renewed which meant 
that uh those people would loose their thei r th
eir Polish citizenship and nationality and the 
Germans uh...and after all, there were thousands 
of Jews from Poland liv
ing in Germany still 
then.  We  ha d quite a big well-organized group of
 Polish Jews, for instance, in Berlin, and and 
the Germans then came to the conclusion that  th
ey will not accept this challenge by the Polish 
governme nt because then they would be burdene d as
 they thought with stateless Jews which they 

couldn't deport if they wa nted to to especially to
 Poland, so what they did was that before the uh 
the laws uh became valid, they uh uh uh rounded up uh Jewish families of Polish origin I mi ght 

say, all over Germany and in in Berlin just th
e man...in in in other cities, full fa milies and 
deported them to the...deported them to the east
 into the no-ma n's  land between Germa ny and 
Poland and uh this created a terrible 
situation.  And of course in a 
ma tter of hours or so that that 
they they invaded their home s in the mi ddle 
of the night and took people out uh uh and amongst 
those who were deported were 
uncles of my wife and uh who 
had come  fr om Poland and had 
ma de their way in Berlin, so we were also pe
rsonally affected, but th
ere was nothing we could 
do.  Uh the the only thing we could do was again 
that the Jewish uh community went into action 
and established interestingly e
nough call it cooperation 
of the police and th
e Gestapo and some  
relief uh uh and work at the uh railway stati
on where these transports came  through and I 
participated also in that work uh uh because es
pecially bene...came to help the younger people, 
the contact between the youth move ment me mber s wa
s still there irrespectiv
e of their ideological 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
11 
 
orientation, Zionists, non-
Zionists.  There was a job to be 
done and we did it and uh it was it 
was...there was utter confusion. 
 It was was was a ruling because
 uh the Germans pushed people 
into the no-ma n's land, especially 
in the area of uh Posen (ph) or 
this _____ what they called it, 
in in east Germany and Upper Salasi a, and th
e Poles didn't accept them, so for ma ny ma ny days 
the unhappy people were exposed to the elements
 and and were not admitted to Poland and 
certainly were not re-admitted to Germany.  Uh
 so uh but eventually uh uh this was some how 
solved.  Poles admitted some  groups and organized 
relief action, as I found out later also with the 
help of young people of the Polish-Jewish youth 
move me nt in Poland, and uh it was so absurd 
that I reme mber when we did this work, uh there we
re transports still rolling towards the east  and 
on the other side of the of the railway stati
on, uh wagons, coaches came back with Jews who had 
not been admitted and had been pushed back, but they or iginated not fr om Germany but fr om 

Vienna, for instance, so that the pr oblem for th
e Jewish community was to
 bring them back at 
their expense to Vienna because they had not
hing to do in Be rlin and uh amongst these uh uh 
people who were deported were were were 
was a couple from Hanover by the name  of 
Greenspan (ph), and uh as you know from hist
ory, young Greenspan who had lived in Hanover 
and had left his home in Hanover and had went
...had gone to Paris and lived in Paris under 
abominable conditions...he was not...he had no pe
rmission to stay.  He was frightened by a 
deportation ordinance so obviously in
 his in his despair then uh 
bought a pistol and went to the 
German Embassy and shot this uh Ge rman.  
He got ________ who interestingly enough was not 

an ardent Nazi.  Uh when this happened uh we
 were all alarme d and I know that I was deeply 
alarmed because something similar had happened be
fore in Switzerland.  A Jew with the name  of 
Frankfurt (ph) had had shot and killed the representative of the Nazi organization in Switzerland 
by the name  of ______, but at this time  the Nazi
s obviously didn't feel strong enough that they 
could do anything.  Uh so uh but now we knew 
some thing would.  Also uh uh shouldn't forget 
that this November 's events came after Muni
ch, the all...I reme mber
 that I think it was 
September...thought we were some how on the br
ink of war in 19...September 1938 under these 
four, Hitler and Mussolini and and _______ and Cha mberlain got together in Muni ch and 

hammered out the agreement selling out Czechoslovakia to the Nazis and this al so uh some how 
gave the Nazis the feeling that now they were
 very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain 
had submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to London to to wave this 

paper saying that in the morni
ng before he left Munich for L
ondon he had another meeting with 
Heir Hitler and this is to say the proof that 
we have peace in our time, so when the November 
events came , certainly Ge rmany already was in 
a much stronger politica
l and military situation, 
and for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that
 that uh the end of the Nazi regime  we had all 
hoped for, because we ha d thought that for econo
mi cal and political reasons there would be...it 
would be only be a transitory ex
istence...that this wa
s not true.  And I uh uh must say that uh... 
 
END OF T APE 1  
...especially Kristallnacht  because it's a Nazi labe l.

Question:  OK.  They asked me  to stop you at this
 point.  The tape is al
most finished and they 
want to change... 
 
Question:  Could you pick it up with
 what happened in November 1938? 
 

Answer:  Yeah.  Should I go back to the youth mo veme nt first? 
 
Question:  Ye s.  If you want to talk
 about how you got....whenever you're ready. 
 

Answer:  I'm ready. 
 
Question:  OK. 
 
Answer:  Uh before I continue with the even
ts of the Nove mber 9th, I think uh it would be 
interesting to know wha t  kind of a position I had 
in the youth move ment.  We call it uh...we were 
not standi ng on formalities.  We had no statut es and so that no charters didn't exist, but I was a 
me mber of the __________, which we considered the 
executive and I I belonged to the to the 
leadership of of this group as long as we could...uh we were able to operate which means up till 

1935, and then uh uh uh later as I told you when we we
re still trying to keep
 the contacts, it it 
was in a very informal way.  There was no positi
on or special position.  Just I was...I...based on 
my seniority if you want to.  I had _______.  Now to
 go back to the 9th of Nove mbe r .  Uh when 
it happened in Paris, I was deeply
 concerned like all of 
us and I had a feeling that some thing was 
going to happen, uh something  basically that m
eans the Nazis now aware of their power and of 
their new won role in the world would say well
, we don't take this, and they were whipping up 
their propaganda.  The headlines were deeply de
pressing.  But there was nothing we could do.  
We had just to wait and see where where wh
ere where where...some how where...when and 
where they would act.  On the November 9th, uh
 I interesting enough, it was a day when I had to 
be prepared for my final final examination of 
the welder course and uh then uh in the in the 
morning when I got out, some body was in the stre
et I me t and said Norbert, the synagogues are 
burning, and I couldn't believe it.  And then a he
...look at these stores...yo
u know, there were still 
Jewish stores...and I saw that uh 
that uh they were smashed, that the windows were smashed.  I 
didn't hear that during the night, and I couldn't be
lieve this, so uh what I did was I went to my 
synagogue where I had been ma rried and I saw that
 the the the the flames were comi ng out from 
the roof, from the cupola...beautiful edifice, a
nd the fire engines were standing by doing nothing, 
only protecting the buildings next to it that the 
fire shouldn't extend to them.  And I still coul dn't 
believe it.  I went to to another synagogue 
which was a very prominent synagogue in west 
Berlin, _________, and I saw the same ...uh fla mes co
mi ng out and there, however, was already I 

could see a tremendous amount of destruction.  I 
was standing there and 
listening to what the 
Germans ha d to say.  There was glee amongst them
.  Uh you know, they said now they got there 
what they deserve and so on, and I asked myself
 i s  this the people, uh is this in whose 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
13 
 
civilization you believe.  Is this the people of Gerta and Shiller (ph) and of the German 
philosophers, the people of the of
 the philosophers and poets?    
And and and I simply...I couldn't 
comprehend it.  It was not acceptable for me .  I wouldn't say not acceptable.  I saw it but I 

couldn't digest, not not intellectua
lly and not emotionally.  And then I went, for instance, to a 
synagogue where the famous Rabbi Prince (ph) 
had had uh been, had off...officiated over the 
years, and there the building was almost complete
ly burned down.  The only part which was still 
left was the lectern from which he had always
 delivered his very fa mous and encouraging 
sermons for for the Jews there.  Of course, he 
was a very proud Jew and a very active Zionist.  
So uh uh and I and and I asked myse lf is this po
ssible.  What goes into into people to do these 
things?   Uh I had...my my knowledge was...I had r
ead about pogroms in the Middle Ages in in in 
especially be fore the Crusaders went  to to liber at e then Palestine uh uh but and when the Jewish 

communities in in in especially al ong the Rhin
e had been destroyed by these Crusaders before, 
but still I was...we were living in 
a modern age, and I really...I ha
d believed in...that was part of 
our education, the goodness 
of ma n.  Could this be possible?   Uh and uh then I went through to 
take my exam, and uh my then wafe (ph) thenwife came to me  and said Norbert, you'r e not 

going home.  We  were at this time  still living with 
my parents in the eastern part of Berlin.  I said 
why.  She said because we heard that the poli
ce is going around taking me n into custody, so uh 
I've arranged already uh that you will stay with 
the mother of a friend who had just left for for 
America recently and and she is alone and sh
e would be glad you come  s o that she feels 
protected some how, and I said what about my fat her
.  She said also for your father we have ma de 
arrangement to uh to uh to uh take
 shelter in the apartment of a 
sister who is a widow.  And uh 
that's  what we did, uh unaware what what uh what 
the next step will be.  And then the next day 
more or less we...and I I was going around...I 
me a n you could go around freely.  There was no 
restriction.  I saw what wh
at had happened in the ma
in streets of Berlin, uh 
___________________, which were the ma in business st re
ets where you still ha d quite a number 
of Jewish stores, retail stores
, and they had been smashed an
d vandalized and the me rchandise 
had been looted.  Uh they say that uh I I c
ouldn't control it but...couldn'
t check it but that, for 
instance, the ladies of the night 
had helped themselves to the fur 
coats out of the of the some  of 
the retail stores on ________ in Berlin.  And uh so 
I spent uh uh a couple of
 nights outside of my 
apartment and uh then uh more and more uh news reached us...and I took cont...tried to contact 
my other friends and found out that also the 
uh the uh ma jor admi nistra
tive buildings of the 
Jewish communities had been some how vandali
zed, so that uh there was no...there wa s no 
activity.  That was for quite a number of days
 and and and and well, 
I realize now that uh 
completely that in this respect the uh the uh sayi
ng of my my spiritual 
leader and rabbi, Leo 
_____, who was the senior of of and the leader 
of uh call it Ge rman Jewry, was right when he 
said that the historical
 hour of Ger man Jewry has come  to an end.  And my  question was what 
am I going to do now.  Especially I felt new respons
ibility for my parents, for my sister, who uh 
also tried to do some thing to 
get out of Ger many, and uh then
 some thing happened uh when uh 
we heard that _____, some  of the men had been ta
ken into custody, had been taken away, and we 
didn't know where.  There were friends of mi
ne amongst them and then we found out that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
14 
 
especially those me n who had been taken into
 custody in Berlin had 
been shipped to the 
concentration camp of Saxonhausen-Orianenburg wh
ich was the uh big camp in the north of 
Berlin.  And that was all we knew.  Uh so 
uh a couple of days later uh some how uh the Nazis 
thought that it would be ri
ght at least to release those peopl
e who had been veterans of World 
War I, and  some  of them were found walking 
around in the streets of 
Berlin, and uh but they 
were...there was a terrible, terrib
le appearance because 
their heads been shav
ed.  Their...the the 
Nazis whenever you come  to a ca mp, were deliver
ed into a concentratio
n camp, the first things 
they did was shave your hair and their clot hing 
was completely crampled (ph) because it had 
gone through a so-called disinfection process,
 so uh...and then one building of the Jewish 
community had started some how to operate again, 
and one of my leaders of the youth move me nt 
had imme di ately uh started to organize some  kind of
 relief for those people who if they had been 
taken into custody in Berlin, they
 knew where to go, but ma ny of
 them ha d come from cities 
outside of Germany, from northern Germany, fr
om western Germany...t hose who had not been 
taken to Buchenwald or Dachau had come  especi
ally from places like west Germany or rural 
districts and so on.  And we or
ganized...and and he organized this
 kind of relief action and he 
called me  into that, to uh try to pick up thes
e people who came  by railway from the concentration 
camp into Berlin, and you could 
recognize them i mmediately, andto bring them to the Jewish 
community where they uh first of all were treate
d me dically.  Some  of them had terrible wounds 
because of frostbite and so...give them a decen
t meal, and especially those who had uh come  
from other...who originated from cities outside toestablish the first telephone contact with their 
fa mily.  That was part of my work, and that 
was really...I mean uh call it emotionally rewarding, 
and I said listen, I have here Mr
. so and so.  He would like to 
speak to you.  And very often you 
heard on the other side an outcry so so uh this ki nd of work uh uh became  became uh uh took on 
took on very substantial dime nsions because more
 people then were released, and as I say, I 
participated in that and to a certain extent al
so my then wife, because she had also lost her 
position, and that was not a ___, a work from nine
 to five, and there was...that was not on a 
salary basis.  It was simply...
it was just relief work to do what
 had to be done and also, for 
instance, to organize that these people could 
get back...uh had by by by railw
ay to their different 
places.  Uh and one of the things they they as
ked uh time and again when these people came, and 

said what what what what do you know about about
 us, what what does the world say?  Tell us.  
Tell me .  What does London and New York and Wa
shington say about this
?   And uh I must say 
this was one of the of the questions uh I...we...none
 of us, my self couldn't answer.  We felt very 
bad about it, because certainl y luckily we had not...I
 had not been affected.  I had avoi ded the the 

the the uh the uh this kind of action and uh when
 they...when these people asked me  and said uh 
fine, you are doing all this work.  It's  wonderful, but 
the future is now dark 
there.  I can't ...I mean 
I know that that that my business is
 destroyed or I am not uh e ntitled 
to continue in my  activities.  
Uh we were told uh you will be release...you ar
e being released here from the from the 
concentration camp unde r the condi
tion that you leave Germany as quickly as possible, so what 
can you tell us?   And my  answer 
was unfortunately nothing.  Certai
nly uh for those of us who, 
you know, to to listen to uh radio Strasburg (p
h) in in German  or to BBC London, it was was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
15 
 
prohibited and there were very seve
re penalties, but still it wa s bei
ng done.  So the only thing we 
we...I could also say from the information I had th
at there we re demonstrations in Ne w York and 
a big meeting in Madison Square Garden, a trem
endous amount of words, uh also but no action.  
Nothing.  And uh I felt almost lost when when 
when these questions...an
d the people were...felt 
lost.  Certainly they were they were happy to 
uh to uh be out of the concentration camps.  It 
was...all of them some how were under shock, beca
use the treatment they had uh experienced in 
these camps was torturous.  They told us about 
the details uh where where in also...I mean I had 
heard before what what people had been exposed to
 when they were taken to Buchenwald or so 
but but you know, here you heard it for the first 
time  from people that had just come  back 
(cough) about this this this...the 
amount of violence to which th
ey had been exposed, so...and the 
beatings and and standing in in in the cold 
for hours and hours without...or, for instance, just 
ma rching without any sense or or
 or shoveling uh uh sand from one heap to another and then...I 
mean without any sense.  Uh so uh I see in this 
respect we all felt lost.  I felt lost, and uh there 
was nothing.  Even when I discussed it with my 
wife and my parents, uh 
there was helplessness, 
absolute helplessness.  And and we we felt lost
 by the world.  Now uh then one evening when I 
was doing this work, the ma n who wa s in charge 
of that relief operation came  to me  and said, 

listen, I have just received a call from the head 
of the uh central organization of Jews...the name  
was the ________ of Jews from Ger many, which means 
the representative of 
the rights of Jews 
in Germany...his name  was Otto Hirsch (ph).  He
 also had been taken into a concentration camp, 
had just returned and he calle
d me  and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is 
some thing then very new development.  Uh be
lieve it or  not, the situation of the Jews in 
Germany and Austria, because Austria was also 
affected by the November events, it ha s been 
discussed in the House of Comm
ons and there is some action unde
r the auspices of the for mer 
Prime Minister of of England, Baldwin (ph), 
and Jewish prominent leaders like uh uh Vi scount 
Sa muel (ph) and ________ and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh 

oppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppre
ssed children so uh uh this is is now to be 
organized also from here, from Ger many and uh Mr
. Hirsch said well, we
 have terrific social 
workers who gradually were flocking back to th
e office, you know, in order to do work, but they 
need technical help and this is some thing you have 
to do.  And I said to him, Martin, excuse me .  
I I'm in the mi ddle of my prepar
ations.  I would like to to le
ave Germany as soon as possible 
because we all are in the same  situation uh and a
nd and he said yes, but you know that's part of 
our education.  There's a job to be done 
and uh uh in Germany you would call it _________, in 
other words to do a thing just fo
r the cause and not for the reward.  So see...he told me  next 
morning, see uh Otto Hirsch in in
 in his office and he will tell you 
all the details, and I came to 
him.  As I say, he was the executive director of
 all operations, Jewish operations, because we had 
a centralized uh organization for that.  I knew him 
because he was the father of a friend who was 
also in our move...youth move me nt, 
now living in in Wa shington, and 
he gave me  details, telling 
me that (clearing throat ) uh he just had been advi
sed that  this is what the British government has 
agreed to and to...but no special conditions.  Th
e only conditions were children have  to be 
healthy, ha d to go with the permission of the 
parents because the parent s could not accompany 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
16 
 
them, and uh had...were restricted to the age of
 twelve to seventeen because this would be 
considered the age where they coul d be...could 
go without the accompaniment of their parent s 
and and and uh wouldn't create special educationa
l problems.  So Otto Hirsch told me  uh uh 
kindly help us, because uh our social workers 
are very devoted and excellent workers but uh 
unfortunately they have no expe
rience in technical ma tters.  I 
said but I have never done 
some thing like that.  Certainly I have partic
ipated in the organization of summer ca mp s in 
England, and and in Sweden and Denmark.  He sa
id still uh kindly help 
us.  I said but don't 
forget I am in the mi ddle of my preparations al
so to leave Germany, and he said well, uh I can 
give you my  promise that when this will be done
 and will be successfully done, it will be our 
commit me nt  and our obligation to help you and your
 fa mily to get out of Germany.  Well, it's a 
promise to which he couldn't live up because uh in early in 1941, I think, he was uh taken again 
into custody, was shipped to the 
concentration camp of Mauthausen
 and murdered there in cold 
blood.  So what I did then was, I went to this
 office where there was a departme nt for children, 
immi gration which _____ had establ ished before b
ecause there was a tric
kl e of children uh who 
had been given the opportunity to go to France, 
Be lgium, Swe den and and America, within the 
quota.  And uh I came to that office and uh when 
I saw what was going on, I almost died.  I...my 
stomach turned around, which was certainly can be e
xplained only from t he s
ituation we were in.  
Uh there was a big conference room i n that uh o
ffice, covered with uh cards, heaps of cards and 
there was a desk which was covered with papers
 and the telephone was constantly ringing and I 
was given to understand...uh there wa s a lady who was in
 charge of it.  She had before been uh in 
high service under the Prussian gove
rnme nt, a Jewish lady, uh had been assistant to one of the uh 
social demo cratic mi nisters from Prussia, and uh 
a trained social worker, and she told me  that 
some thing has to be done to to organize this pr
operly, and uh after havi
ng seen that and having 
recovered a little bit, th
e first thing I did was to call in some
 of my friends, again from the youth 
move me nt.  We all uh at this time  had no...wer
e not gainfully employed in productive work, and 
all purposes more or less lost
 our positions and uh the firs
t thing I organized were these 
cards...these cards were so called...w
hen I asked what is it...these are permits which had come  in 
already from England to give uh 
children the the permit to come to
 England.  In other words they 
didn't need passports and so there we re specia
l cards worked out with the cooperation of the 
home  office in England, with a picture and s
o...which had come  from England and then the 
German police had certified the the the uh the name
s and the age and so on, and these were cards 
which which gave the young people of that age a lic
ense to enter England, so the first thing we 
did...was I did was, with the help of my friends, 
to organize these cards in alphabetical order and 
in geographical order in order to have some  kind of a of a of a n idea what was what, and then it 

would give me some some worki
ng room at the desk and organized the telephone calls to such 
extent that, you know, when, for instance, it 
happened a telephone call came from a from a 
desperate parent from anywhere and said what's 
about the application of 
my of my of my child, 
and then one of these social workers jumped to that
 tabl e and they they they
 fished out of the of 
that mound of of paper the the the permit, because 
they said ye s, I reme mber it had arrived this 
morning or yesterday morning.  And as I sai
d, there there was disorder but not...but not ____ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
17 
 
because they wanted but things were...had had 
ha d had...were were in a rush and and and and 
had overwhelmed the m, so uh then I found out that
 we...it wa s...we...it wa s organized in such a 
way that people, that parents we
re advised in Berlin and the 
Jewish communities outside of 
Berlin and also under the rules a
nd regulations, they had set alrea
dy with the with the...believe it 
or not by cooperation with the with the Gesta
po, under which the the ______ had to work, that 
uh uh the Jewish communities, the the welfare ag
encies uh and ______ agencies had to select the 
children, which means that the child
ren...the parents who got a way of 
assist of this project, ma de 
an application to the pr oper Jewish co mmunities 
and then the social  workers, the local social  
workers, then checked the...if the conditions we
re right and and then they they ma de the 
application.  I had nothing to do with that, so wh
at my task was, and I was advised to do that, 
was to organize the transports so 
that they could get out of Germ
any.  Now also that was not an 
easy task because we had to liveunder certain rules and regulations
 be cause in order to prepare a 
transport, you had to prepare the proper lists, 
the records.  One copy had to go to the Gestapo.  
One copy had to go London in order to advise 
the people in London that the children were 
comi ng and whoever were the pros
pective foster parents or  the 
the hostels which had to be 
prepared for these people had to be had to be 
ma de ready, and all this 
was done.  Certainly there 
were no faxes and no computer systems and 
and and when you ma de...had...the telephones did 
not uh...there was no push button system.  For inst
ance, to make a telephone call to London from 
Berlin could last hours and hours and even with
in Germany i t  was not...you know, it was still in 
the age of...the the age when most of the work 
or all the work had to be done ma nually.  So 
some how this we got under control and I set up 
a certain...I can't say I because uh I wa s then I 
was ma de responsible for all techni
cal aspects of these transports, so
 that means uh first of all to 
see to it that the that  the lists were properly pr
epared, that the parents we
re were advised uh when 
to when to br ing their children to Berlin, esp
ecially from eastern or northern uh Germa ny and 
mi ddle Germany, because the starting point was Ber
lin.  Then I had to uh approach the railway 
authorities to give us rese rved coache s, because
 they couldn't travel with the other public.  Uh 
then a special room had to be ma de available as an
 assembly point in a railway station.  The local 
police ha d to be advised, because uh certainly 
all this was done under the supervision of the 
police authorities.  Uh then we had...and I...that 
was also my  responsibility to find escorts.  
Parents could not go with their children, so we ha
d to find escorts to take them, to take these 
children, so again there was the 
the huma n resource...of of the young 
people of the of the of the 
me mbers of the youth moveme nt, irrespective 
as I say, Zionists, non-
Zionists, all this 
disappeared.  And we found wonde
rful people, teachers and and 
youth leaders and so who who 
volunteered for that service.  Uh and uh at the 
beginning we were...it was ma
de clear to us that 
uh these escorts coul d only escort the uh the youngste
rs to the border, but there was no chance to 
take them to England.  This luckily changed 
very soon thereafter because we were able to 

convince the authorities that uh it was in the Germ
an interest also to take them up to London, and 
they agreed under one condition...that all these escort
s uh were to return again to Berlin.  Now at 
this time  uh starting in the summer of 1938, all 
Jews who who were holding a German passport 
had stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws, we
 were still considered German nationals...all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

German pas sports had printed a J into their pa
ssports, and when people came back, especially 
after the November events, to Germany they we
re taken imme diately into custody and shipped 
into a camp, in a concentration camp, so in orde
r to protect our escorts,
 the uh Ministry of the 
Interior, the Nazi Ministry of 
the Interior, gave everyone who 
who was an escort, they call it 
protection letter which he could us
e for the border police to say and it said that so and so, in my 
case Norbert Israel Wolheim, you know that's my
 name , was was is is traveling in German 
interests and should be ______ and so uh we had 
the first transport under 
those conditions ready 
in January.  And I was instrume
ntal in...that was my first resp
onsibility, and uh together with 
some friends who were also escorts I uh accompan
ied this transport to the border which was uh 
Bentheim (ph).  It was a German...a Dutch border.
  I also had to inform not only the people in 
England but people in Holland, Jewish...the uh the uh 
relief organizations because they wanted to 
help the children when they were trave
ling through uh Holland because the techni cal 
arrangements were that people...as I said, before
 came  from all kinds...from all cities, assembled 
in Berlin.  Then from Be rlin the train left, 
went via Hanover to the border in Bentheim, uh uh 
went into Holland, uh we nt from to ______, Holland where they boarded a ferry and the ferry 
took these children uh through the Channel or via th
e Channel to Harwich (ph) in England where 
they landed in England and they had to unde
rgo immigration uh checks and and customs checks 
and then the train took us from Harwich to Londo
n where at Li verpool Street Station, the Jewish 
Committee of of uh of London had established thei
r reception center where then the parents and 

the uh the uh officials came  and and and distribu
ted the children.  This fi rst transport uh uh still 
is very vi vid in my me mory because  when we came to the border, uh the SS guards who were uh 

uh doing custom duties and they were not all of 
them, or none of them was trained in this 
respect...they ascended the the the uh coaches an
d they behaved like vandals.  They did not 
attack the children, but they treated the luggage
...it was completely vandalized, the luggage.  
Were tearing it apar t looking for jewels and fo
r foreign currency and fo
r things like that.  
Couldn't find a thing, but at least 
this is what they did, and any a
ttempt to talk to them and so 
certainly was in vain.  And uh then uh it was so 
bad that they uh separated the coaches with the 
with the Jewish children from the other train a
nd the train left for Holland and when this train 
without the children 
arrived in Holland, the auth
orities there were wait
ing and saw the children 
were not there.  And amongst the people who we
re serving...I mean who 
were uh the cause was 
was were two ladies whose name  should be reme
mbered in in gratitude.  Both non-Jewish.  One 
was uh Ms. Fontaine (ph)  and the ot her Mrs. Weis
miller (ph) who even even had dealings with 
the ______.  Very courageous, wonderful uh lady.  
She was the uh the uh the wife of a banker, a 
prominent banker in Holland, had no children and ha
d devoted all her time to to help especially 
children, Jewish, non-Jewish, and 
she all of a sudden came fr om Holland.  She had made her 
way from Holland to Bentheim and uh when sh
e saw and she heard what has happened...uh don't 
forget, it was before the beginning of the war...she 
lashed into these SS people.  It was...I was so 
grateful, and _____ one of these SS me n, said I ha
ve the feeling you don't like us very much and 
she said well, personally I mi ght but as a gr
oup you are impossible.  But then, interesting 

enough, by her interventions she...they they stop
ped their their vandalism.  The two coaches 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
19 
 
were then attached to a later trai n which still ma
de in time  for  the ferry and we then uh uh were 
able, as I tried to explain before, to get the permi
ssion of the of the Departme nt of the Interior to 
get passports to take these children to to to to
 England.  Now to select these people wa s a very uh 
uh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a 
chance to go to England certainly looked for 
a chance, and there were friends or relatives 
pressing on them and said are you stupid to go 
back, but this was the condition, and they 
had...the the Nazis had told us in no uncertain term
 that if people would not uh obey their order, 
then these these transports would come to an end 
and this certainly we could not afford.  So as I 
say, I was very, very careful in the selection of
 those people and thank G
od with the exception of 
one case, it worked.  Now we had uh uh uh approx
imately I think twenty, 
twenty transports uh 
which left Berlin.  Uh it was my duty to see a
ll of them off, and I was uh uh uh every morning 
when they came together, I was there to to arrang
e it, so uh uh whether I went with the transports 
or not, that was in a in a big hall in in in cal
l it ________ Berlin, and also 
part of my  duties were 
to see to it that the children came to
 Berlin in time so that  they were pre...and certainly they came 
with their parents or their relatives and this wa
s then the uh the the mo me nt of their goodbye, so 
uh there was a problem uh with the first transports
 which...for which I had not been responsible.  
A s maller group had left in in in December 
I think, and the parents 
had accompanied these 
children to the to the trains a
nd certainly parents in good faith they try to get the best wi ndow 
seats for for their children, and th
ere was a certain turmoil and the 
police told us in no uncertain 
terms that if this would be repeated, they woul
d control all the all all these arrangements.  We 
were able to convince them that we will take over
, that we will see to it that or der should prevail 
and that they shouldn't interfere, that they could 
be present if they want to, not ____ present fine 
but they shouldn't interfere.  And I think it wo
rked.  So uh when in the morning when when 
when such a transport wa s due to to leave, as 
I say, I was there and uh it 
was a very, very, very...I 
reme mber that very distinctly the atmosphere, you 
know.  It was...there was tension in the air.  
There was an atmosphere of expectation.  There 
was concern by the parents.  There were...there 
were kiss...there were tears of 
laughter and tears of of joy and 
and the concern and pain and it 
was a very, very special atmosphere which was di
fficult to describe.  And then when the when 
the hour of departure came  closer, I uh ascended a 
a chair, some  kind of a  lecture, and told the 

parents...ladies and gentleme n, the time has arri
ved to say goodbye, because we are under strict 
order not to let you accompany your children to the 
platform.  The escorts will take over and the 
baggage handlers had to do their work before 
to to handle the baggage, but you cannot come  and 
don't...please uh cooperate and don't ma ke our our wo
rk more  difficult.  But this is the time you 
have to say goodbye.  And there were, you know, la
st kisses and last hugs and and and and...but 
in general I still admi re these people, how c
ourageous they we re.  Nobody broke down, but also 
there was the expectation that 
uh sooner or later they would be
 reunited again.  Very often I 
asked myself the question later, where did I 
take the courage to 
do that you call it _______, 
where where from?   I wa s young.  I was only twenty
-five in these days, 
and I thought uh uh that 
this is a job to be done in order to help these ch
ildren and I also I must say that at this time I and 
nobody else could have thought for 
a mo me nt that this would 
for ma ny, for almost ninety 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
20 
 
percent, the last goodbye.  Nobody c
ould expect that let us say a ye
ar and a half later after these 
transpor ts had rolled to the west into fr eedom, th
a t  transports would leave for the east into the 
into the slaughterhouses of Hitler in Auschw
itz or  _______ or Treblinka.  I said nobody could 
foresee it in the worst of of of your vision, and th
en uh thus I I say this probably also...yes, gave 
me  the justification to say to these parents and ma ny I talked to to
 the children who were safe...I 
said that this is a mo ment, one
 of the most important mo ments in thei r lives which they still 
reme mber vividly, and I was involved 
in that.  But I came to terms with that by saying this is the 
contribution which which which we had to ma ke a
nd in the long run, at l
east for these children, it 
turned out for the good.   And uh when we landed 
in in England, uh we were uh helped...the the 
Jewish Committee was then the Blooms bury (ph) 
House in in England which cooperated with 
the ________.  It was the central headquarters of 
the board of Jewish de
puties in England and 
and helped us to stay in England for two days 
or two...two and a half days.  I had...constantly I 
had uh uh discussions with my counterpart in
 the in the Committee there to streamline 
operations, to uh...also there were 
certain requirements in England which had to be obeyed and 
there was always...I didn't  have too much time 
in England to see friends or relatives though I 
tried to ma nage some how, and also I had the privilege...the other escorts 
on their way back had 
to take the train.  I had the priv
ilege to uh to uh to take the...to 
fly back which at this time  was 
still a big thing, but since I was needed in Ber...Ber
lin so badly, I, as I say, I could fly back.  We  
did not see where the children were going because 
we didn't have the time.  Our job ha d ended 
the mo ment we handed them over to the committee 
at Liverpool Street St
ation and they were 
then uh uh acquainted with their foster parents or or or the families they took them in or the 
hostels.  Only one transport I took uh uh from 
London up to the north of England.  That was the 
transport of _____,  of trainees for for for then
 Palestine, because uh Lord Balfour (ph), the 
father of the Balfour decoration, who had no childr
en, had made his castle in in Scotland, near 
the _____ near Edinburgh, available to the Jewish ag
ency and the Jewish agency had used one of 
his janitor home s or so to establish a kibbutz 
there where the young people were educated uh for 
and prepared for for Palestine and uh I think a 
group of ten or twelve of ma inly boys I took to 
that pl ace because I wanted to see what was going on, but that was the only time when I was 

really...at this time when I became fa miliar with th
e conditions of the children we are taking to 
England.  Certainly later I've seen a lot of litera
ture about these events.  I saw the problems, the 
tremendous problems, and I think this should be ma
de part of of history because uh uh first of 
all, it  is part of the Holocaust history but I w
ould also say it is some thing which which for which 
we have to express gratitude to England.  Afte
r all, when they discussed it and when they 
promulgated this this project, they were stil
l some how under the influence of Cha mber l ain's 
policy of appeasement and uh nevertheless under the im
pact of the events in Germany, especially 
in Novembe r , uh uh they came to the conclusion that we  want to do some thing.  They did not uh 

ma ke uh uh work out charters to 
see after so many years the child
ren have to go back or they 
can't  stay longer.  Nothing of this respect was said.  Just Engl and 
wanted to give shelter to these 

people...to these children to to to
 uh to save them from oppression 
and in this respect I am using 
a word, when I talked about it be fore, of of the man I admi re so much, Wi nston Churchill, when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
21 
 
he said that even this was England's finest 
hour, and should recognize 
that and I think we...to 
repeat it we should ma ke it a part of the record 
even here in Washington 
in the Museum in my 
opinion, because this belongs to the to the to th
e successful action and reac
tion of the rescuers.  
Uh the last transport which left Berlin was prepar
ed uh in the end of Augu
st.  It was supposed to 
leave Berlin on September 1st.  I was supposed 
to go because there were certain uh problems 
which had come  up and which had to be disc
ussed with our people in London.  I had my 
passport.  I had my protection lett
er.  I had my ten ma rks in foreign currency.  More we were not 
allowed to have, but certainly the the the war fe
ver developed into a pitch and uh then we were 
bombarded from England with a requ
est to try to some how uh change
 the date of the departure to 
an earlier date, and it took tremendous efforts to 
do it because all the chil
dren and all the parents 
had to be notified and things had to rearrange, so
 anyhow we were able to to to uh uh to uh have 
it, to change the departure date from Septem
ber 1st to August 29, and I decided then uh on 
account of the situation not to be
 the leader of that transport 
because uh my then wife was in 
Berlin and I and my parents and my sister and 
I felt responsibility and and I was concerned that 
if something would happen, especi ally if a war will come, I will be cut off and I I felt that uh uh I 
could not have done this toward my family and 
this is the reason why I 
was caught in Germany.  
The transport luckily left uh Germany on the 
29th, had difficulties to uh get through Holland.  
Holland had already mo bilized.  Uh there were no 
boats available at the beginning, but also with 
the help of our people in Holland in the last mi nu
te they found a ferry, ferrying these children to 
England and when they arrived in Harwich th
ey they...England had alr
eady...was already in a 
state of a blackout, so they came to England or 
I would say on the eve on th
e war.  They...I think 
they landed on the...on September 1st or 2nd, befo
re England had declared war but Germany had 
already entered...start military ope
rations against Poland.  That was the end of the uh of the 
project.  From Ger many we had uh been able to
 get out between six or seven thousand children.  
Uh Austria also a couple of thousand.  As I said
 before, we we we didn't have any contact with 
Austria.  We  were not allowed to corroborate with
 them, so that was extra, extra operation and 
uh then after that, st ill a fe w transports, sma
ll transports, left for Denmark, for instance, 

_________, for training there, but that was all.  
The the the the childre
n immigration stopped by 
the beginning of the war and that was the end of that. 

 
Question:  What was the total num
ber of children that you got out? 
 

Answer:  I said from Germany approxima tely seven thousand. 
 
Question:  Do you reme mber any 
of the children particularly? 
 

Answer:  Uh, no, because uh uh, you know, don't  forget these were thousands of children.  I I 
reme mber certain certain uh children.  I I reme mber the gra
ndchildren of Rabbi ______ who who 
were taken to England so uh uh but I never me t 
them a fter the war anymore, but it so happened 
that not too long ago, uh I addresse
d a group of children, kinder (ph)
 they call themselves, in Los 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
22 
 
Angles and a ma n with grey hair
 came  to me  and said, you must have been my uh l eader of the 
transpor t in February 1939.  And I said yes, I do, because that was the first transpor t I took from 
Berlin to London, and this is true
.  I certainly didn't  recognize 
him anymor e, and uh then at the 
same  evening a lady came to me  and said, and yo
u must have been my 
my leader in April 1939, 
and I told her it must have been approximately on April 18th or so 
and she said, yes, but how do you reme mber, and I 
said I reme mber that when I flew back uh it 
was Hitler's birthday on April 20th, and the Germ
ans had illumi nated the the major uh avenues 
of Berlin, so when I flew back and I had that pr
ivilege, the pilot would do 
us a favor to show the 
spectacle of Berlin, seeing this th
is sea of of of of of
 light from the air, a
nd I think I came  back 
on on April 21st, and and _________, and by the way uh this
  was also little little little...it is not 
revenge but but call it satis
factions I always had when
 I landed in in in in in Berlin, the airpor t at  
this time  wa s on _________ which was...the airport 
which was used during the bridge...the air 
bridge, and when I landed  th
ere and I me t the uh the border po
lice and there was a fellow, you 
know, almos t  out of a ______ opera with a w
ith a with a like ___________ with a big me tal 
shield and all kinds of things put on there, and 
I showed him my passport 
and he thought already 
he had caught one of those who could become  hisuh customers, and then very very slowly I took 

my letter out and show it to him and he couldn't 
quite grasp it and he sa
id one mo ment please, 
because he ha d to go to hi s superior to verify that
 this is genuine and so on and then he let me  go, 

to his regret, so that was a certain...ca
ll it a certain amount of s a tisfaction. 
 

Question:  Was attempts...were any attempts ma de 
to let the children...the 
parents know that the 
children had arrived safely? 

 
Answer:  Oh yeah, because uh because as...before
 the war, there was correspondence and some  
of these children then, and it was 
one of the first things
 they did, was that they uh uh asked their 
foster parents to help them to get the uh the 
uh the parents out.  In cer
tain cases they were 
successful, but I would say between eighty or ni
nety percent were not, and then you had the 
situation that when the war broke out, you c
ould only communicate viathe International Red 
Cross.  And uh that took a long time , but it work
ed at the beginning but 
then starting with the 
deportations, these letters didn't arrive anymor
e fr om from Ge rmany and the children, you know, 
are quite desperate ______ the even
ts slowly realized that some
thing mu st have happened, but 
they became fully aware of the s
ituation only after the end of the war when the truth came  out.  
Uh you mi ght ask me  if I have special...special me
mories of that.  Uh there are two stories I like 
to tell because they are so very interesting 
and typical.  One was uh in the summer of 1939, uh 
we were advised by the British governme nt 
through the ________ House and Bloomsbury House 
that we should...ought to be careful with the im
port of me rchandise which could be used for 
commercial use.  What does it mean?  Since uh you couldn't take out funds from Ger many...we 

all were restricted to just ten ma rks...uh certain
ly parents and other group
s which who uh tried to 
get out, took with them whatever
 they could...uh jewelry if there 
was the permission
 to do it, but 
also uh expensive cameras and and so on and these cameras or uh music instrume nts and so had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
23 
 
found their way into the uh uh British ma rket 
and the Chamber of Commerce in England had 
brought it to the attention of the governme nt that they considered it unfair competition because, 
you know, when the people came there with no money, 
they sold it for whatever they could get 
for it.  So uh we advised the parents accordin
gly and tried and hoped that...so on one of these 
occasions when I was the transpor t leader, we 
came  to Harwi c h and uh then all of a sudden I 
heard a a voice, my na me, Mr. Wolheim, and ther e was a cust oms official and I asked him what's 

the problem,  and my English, thank God, 
was good enough, I mean my schooling which was 
good enough to communicate with him...uh what's the pr
oblem?   He said, sir, we have a problem 
here because we just found that th
is this boy or this this lad has 
has a has a...is ca
rrying a violin.  
I said what's wrong with a violin?   He said, it's not an
 ordinary violin.  It's  
a very valuable violin.  
Uh certainly it was not a 
Stratovarious (ph) or __
____ or ________ or ______, but it was a 
valuable violin, so I said, sir, but most probably 
the parents gave this to the boy because he liked 
music, and uh this was probably his violin 
before so he took it al
ong, and he took it along 
because he liked music.  I didn't know that the boy 
was able to play.  So 
he looked at him and he 
said...then in order to save the 
situation I said, why don't we let 
him play some thing so that you 
can be...uh see that this is some thing which actually 
belongs to him.  He said that's a good idea.  
And that fellow started to play, and you know I 
was very nervous because I didn't know would it 
succeed or  not, so he started to pl ay and all of a sudden everyt hing around that boy and us 
became very quiet and I didn't realize at the firs
t mome nt what had happened, and then I came to 
to to realize that he ha d started to pl ay "G
od Save the King," and because of that, you know, the 
customs officials couldn't continue to operate, so
 I started...tried to stop 
him but he was playing 
all three stanzas.  When he was finished and I 
felt better and asked, sir, are you now convinced 
that this boy loves music.  He said, oh yes, 
thank you very mu ch.  And the other story I like to 
tell is uh, you know, we were under a very strong regul
ations to see to it th
at only children up to 
the age of seventeen were comi ng in, and we ch
ecked the the uh records carefully and the cards 
back and forth and we thought everything was fine. On one of these transports when I was the 
leader, you know, when when when when 
you got to uh to uh _______, Holland and put...and 
the children boarded the ferry, we
 put the children to to sleep. 
 They had certain bunks and so 
we, the the escorts started to work in the lounge
 in order to pre...prepar
e for the next morning 
because we wanted to be as helpful as possible 
to the immi gration authorities not to have any 
hitchup.  So still working on that and uh we were 
treated very, very nicely by the crew of that 
ferry and that was really, in comparison to Ge
rma ny, was a wonderful thing.  In the mi ddle of 
that a friend of mi ne, wa s an es
cort, came to me and said, Norber
t, we have a problem here.  I 
said what's the problem?  He said look at the card. 
 I said what is it.  He said that boy is is is 

is...has passed his seventeenth birthday.  He's  eight
een years old.  I said let me  said again, and 
sure it was true.  So I knew we had a problem. I said let me  see...let us ask the boy.  So they 

brought the boy out of his bunk and 
when he came , I al most...I almost fainted because he had 
just been released from a  concentration camp.  
His hair was shaven and obviously he realized 
that some thing was wrong and he was shaking like a _____ bone.  So we asked him when were 
you born, and sure enough, he was eighteen years ol
d.  So we went into a huddle with the other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
24 
 
other me mb ers of our escorts and there were tw
o opinions.  One was to throw ourselves at the 
me rcy of the  immi gration officer the next morni
ng and say sorry, but that 
would me an that uh he 
had to obey his rules and regulati
ons and had eventually had to 
send him back and if he would 
have been...if they would send him back that wa
s the end of him because they would take him 
back into a concentration camp i mmediately, a
nd there was the other gr
oup, and I was one of 
them, who s a id well, the only thing is effectivel
y is to say it was a mi stake ma de by the German 
police, and they entered the the date that they 
ma de up...that they changed the...the the date they 
put in was was wrong, but we had to tell the boy that
 this was it, and ma de him our ally, so uh he 
realized that and we said listen, 
you are not born in this year.  Y
ou are born one year later.  You 
understand that.  He said very well.  And we...als
o one of our friends who was a teacher said you 
know what we should do it is we should some how tr
y to program hi m t hat even in the mi ddle of 
the night we should ask him when were you born, so that when the question will come  up in 

England that he can...that he will not stutter and 
and and stumble but will say it.  OK.  We landed 
in Harwich, all tired, dead tired, 
uh went through the usual process.
  All of a sudden I hear, Mr. 
Wolheim, ki ndly see the immi gration officer... 
 
END OF T APE 2  
 
 
...what's the problem.  He said well uh I ca
nnot admit this young ma n uh because uh he is 
eighteen years old and you know very well that uh
 under the uh rules and regulations adopted he 
cannot be older than seventeen years.  So I 
said well, ask the boy, and when the boy came, you 
know, and he was shaking and he sort of...hair wa
s shaven...that officer also I me an some how uh 
fainted.  Some thing had to be done, so uh uh uh uh 
how do you explain this.  I said it must have 
been a mi stake by the German police.  He said but the German police 
is well known and almost 
infamous for their accuracy.  I said yes, but to
day under the Nazi regime , they brought in a lot of 
people who came in just for the part y affiliation 
and not for the effi ciency and and bureaucratic 
work.  He said is that so.  I said definitely.  So
 he again looked at the 
card, he looked at this boy 
and there was a mo ment of silen
ce and and and really I felt...I fe
lt...I mean this was the moment 
where we...a decision had to be ma de about the life 
of a human being and then he said to me , sir, 
could you guarantee that this is a mi stake of the 
German police, and I said by all means.  Now he 
knew that I was lying and I knew that he knew 
that I was lying, but then he took a stand, 
admitted to the United Kingdom, bec a use he knew that if not, some thing terribl e coul d have 
happened to him, so this uh...he saved his life. 
 
Question:  We need to stop right here. 
 
 
Answer:  Well, the second story I would like to 
tell because it had a ve
ry interesting, huma n 
aspect is uh under the rules and regulations, uh we  
were not allowed to bring in children over the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
25 
 
age of uh seventeen and uh therefore we we not 
only prepared the uh papers and the lists, we 
checked carefully everything so that we shoul
dn't have any problems coming to England.  On 
one of the transports uh when I was the leader 
of that group uh uh we had a problem because uh 
usually we uh when we landed in in...when we got to uh ______, Holland, we put the children 
into their bunks and the ferries
 then took us from ______, Holland, to Harwich which was a trip 
of approximately six hours, some time s a very rou
gh crossing of the Channel, but for us, for the 
escorts, uh there was no time to relax because we 
had to prepar e our list s and our papers for the 
next morning for the landing in Harwich and in England in order to ma ke it easy for the 

immi gration, to help them.  So we were sitti
ng in a lounge uh doing this kind of work, treated 
nicely by the crew of th
at ferry to tea and cookies uh and all of a sudden a friend of mi ne 
approached me  and said uh uh...who was also an esco
rt...said there is a problem.  I said what's 
the problem.   He said this boy here has passed 
his seventeenth birthda
y.  He is definitely 
eighteen years old.  I said I can't  believe it.  He sa
id look at this.  So I looked at this and sure 
enough, found out and had confirme d that he had 
completed his seventeenth birthday, so the 
question was how to handle the situation, and 
there were two opinions.  One was to throw 
ourselves at the me rcy of the immi gration officer 
and tell him that there wa s a mi stake, an honest 
mi stake, and appeal to his uh uh sense of fa
irness, if you want, which certainly uh could 
endanger the boy because uh he coul d say no, I am not allowed uh to to admit hi m.  But first I 

said, let us see the boy who it is.  Uh we aske
d the boy to come  down from his bunk, and when I 
saw him I almost fainted because it turned out
 that he had just  been released from a 
concentration camp.  His head was shaven and 
he was shaking uh becaus
e he realized that 
some thing was wrong.  We asked him how old ar
e you and sure enough, the uh date reflected on 
this card was correct.  He  was already eighteen 
 years old.  So as I told you, for in this 
deliberation what to do, the group uh...the one gr
oup uh thought we should we should infor m and 
stick with the date and and le
t it pass, hoping that the immi gration would have me rcy on us, and 
the other group, and I belonged to them, thought it 
would be easier to sa
y that the Germans had 
ma de a mi stake when then entered the birth date, but
 also tell the boy that he
 has to lie in his own 
interest, and the boy understood this ve
ry well.  So we told him that that was...the ma jority then 
came to the conclusion they uh try to convince 
immigration of a mi stake.  And one of our 
escorts, a teacher, said well, we have to try to
 program this boy, even during the night have to 
wake him up to tell that he has 
to confirm that he is one year
 younger than the paper says.  We  
came to Harwich.  Didn't take long.  Uh I was 
called...Mr. Wolheim to immi gration office.  I 
want to see you.  What's  the problem?    He said sir, we have a problem, the immi gration officer 

said, because uh I cannot admit this this lad, he said, because he is over seventeen years.  I said I 
I can't  believe it.  I said ask him, so that 
boy came, shaking, pale, but when the immi gration 
officer saw him with his shaven 
head, some how happened to him...I
 could feel, I could see it...so 
he asked me  what is your explanation here.  I sa
id uh the police ma de a mistake and he said well, 
the German police is not known for easily ma king mi
stakes, and my reaction was to tell, well the 
police is not the same  police you are knowing from
 the old days.  Many Nazis just on account of 
party affiliation have entered the service and they are not of the same quality as before, and I'm 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
26 
 
fully convinced that is so what the boy said, that
 he is seventeen years ol
d, so he looked at me  
and he looked at the boy for quite some  ti me
 and I...it was mi nutes uh uh just sounded like 
eternity and then he  tu
rned to me  and said sir, can you guara
ntee the fact that the German police 
has a mi s...has ma de a mistake, and immediately I answ
ered yes sir.  I can do 
it.  So he knew that 
I was lying, and I knew that he kne
w that I was lying.  He looked
 again at the boy, took a stand, 
and stamped admitted to the United Kingdom a
nd in this way he saved a huma n life. 
 
Question:  Ca n you tell us now what 
happened to you when the war broke out? 
 
Answer:  Well, when the war broke out we uh 
we uh uh...when I say we I me an it me ans also 
myself...lived with the expectation that they mi ght do some thing, the Nazis, take us into to labor 

camps _____, being afraid that uh we mi ght endanger the German war efforts, who knows.  All 
kind of crazy things were possible, but but nothi
ng happened.  I continued my work uh for the uh 
central office in in Berlin, for the Central Jewish
 Office in Berlin, for a 
certain while.  We had 
still a couple of s mall transpor
ts going to Denmar k, to the _____ 
center, but this fizzled out soon, 
and then I wa s asked to take over the admi nistra
tion of the vocational training uh schools, uh the 
the...this organization uh had set up, especially
 outside of Berlin...carpentry, plumbing, me tal 
work and so on.  These were very good sc
hools uh uh and let...by Jewish and non-Jewish 

teachers.  He lped very much uh children to acquire
 vocational traini ng, and so I also had to travel 
to a certain extent in Germany wh
ic h was not easy at this time but I still...it was it was possibl e.  
And uh then uh uh in in the summer of '41, uh in 
the course of the uh events and especially uh 
after uh uh...after uh Germany was successful in Poland and in France and in in in Norway, and 
had taken over all these countries and occupied
 them, uh there started what we called the the 
final solution also in Germany, especially in Be
rlin, and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh 
it's better to stay away from work in the centr
al office because  there was nothing we could do 
any more for our for our Jewish people, and I had th
e the feeling and I want to be careful in this 
respect, that we more or less uh would be in the 
danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than 
to do what what was necessary to do in the Jewi
sh interest, though I realized fully that all these 
leaders, devoted me n, most of them had become  ma
rtyrs, tried to do their 
best to save Jewish 
lives, but uh uh there was nothing an
ymore to be done, so I decided to to become  separated from 
the work for the for the rest...____ call them...of Jews
 in Germany and I uh uh had to uh report to 
an office which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish
 workers in in...for forced labor.  In other 
words, the uh Jews who had lost their jobs and w
ho could not work any more in in in offices and 
so they were drawn into all kinds of work, 
digging work, transport 
work, uh uh factory work, 
whatever it was, because also on account of th
e uh disappearing ma npower of of Germany, they 
needed us for this.  That's  what we thought.  So
 uh I was uh uh...I reported that I was a welder, so 
I was uh then uh sent to a firm, to a German fi
rm in Berlin uh which had a Jewish group which 
means at this time uh Jews could not work as  in
dividuals.  Jews could only work in groups and 
the people who had taken on these groups had to provi
de special facilities, 
special toilets and so, 
so that Jews and non-Jews didn't mi x.   And uh th
is group I I joined certainly not voluntarily but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
27 
 
but uh the special problem was that this was a fa
ctory which was located in the eastern part of 
Berlin, uh the northeastern part of 
Berlin.  I was living at
 this time  on the we
st and it was a long 
way to the factory and I had to get up between f
our thirty and five o'clock in the morning in 
order to ma ke it on time.  Uh this was also the time when the first uh air raids started of the 
British air uh air force against Berlin, so uh duri
ng the so-called alarms, when I was at home we 
were...had to take shelter in a basement.  Jews we
re separated there also 
from from non-Jews and 
later we realized that these ba
seme nts certainly didn't give any kind of protection, but this is 
actually what was done.  But also 
in that factory, uh Jews were we
re pressed into service uh for 
for as...not air raid wardens but uh uh uh a group to
 uh to uh fight fires or
 whatever it is if 
some thing should happen, so that uh very often I didn't come  home  uh uh for for almo st two 
days, didn't know what was going on at home.  Uh in in in Nove mber '39, by the way, uh my 
wife and I had our child...a boy was was born and 
uh since we  had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell 
that  certainly at the beginning of the war, Jews
 were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or 
have radio, so I was not...was not was not able
 to communicate with them, so uh so uh uh that 
means very often, especially afte
r an air raid and if it was a he
avy air raid, I didn't know what 
happened to my fa mily and my fa mi l y didn't 
know what happened to me , and uh then in the 
summer of '41, there started what we  called the fi
nal solution.  Uh we...in Be
rlin the head of the 
Jewish community was called to the Gestapo and 
he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse 
me...that for a thousand people uh apartments  sh
ould be ma de available uh and uh the uh the 
people should uh should assemble in a synagogue uh 
and not be accommodated at another place.  

Now I think I overlooked one thing, that uh also
 in September '41 there started...laws were 
promulgated to force Jews to wear a yellow ba
dge, and from this time  on...that was Se ptember 
'41.  By the way, it was also the time when
 no immi gration was possible from Ger many 
anymore.  Even during the war in the first part, 
there was still certain po
ssibilities to co me to 
America via Portugal or later 
after the campaign in Poland, vi
a Siberia, by train through 
_______, but in September '41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that 
we tried very hard but the German...the Americ
an Consulate uh with which I was registered uh 
asked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers
, our affidavits, but that
 was not easy to get in 
America and also the the Consul
ate stopped very early to proce
ss applications.  It also set 
conditions which were impossible.  More can 
be read about this in
 the book of David _______ 
about the abandonment of the Jews.  The American 
bureaucracy at this time  was not very helpful 
to save people it could have saved.  Now uh in 
connection with the with the promulgation of the 
laws about the about the yellow ba
dge, there uh other restrictions 
started.  We  were not allowed 
anymore to uh to use certain streets.  We were 
not allowed to uh to uh to buy and to go shopping, 
only at certain hours.  We certainly...we coul
dn't see a movie or our theater and uh uh any...we 
were were also...we had to to place the Star of Da
vid at the outside of our
 of our doors in the in 
the apartments.  So life became became became  mo
re and more uh difficult, almost impossible.  
We still tried to uh get to...I, fo
r instance, saw friends if possible and we uh we uh...and  my 
parents lived in the easter part of
 Berlin and we, as I said before, 
in the western part  and certainly 
my parents were very much interested and also
 the parents of my wi
fe, to see our boy but uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
28 
 
when we we re not allowe d to uh to uh use the 
public transportation, we even walked that way 
which was two and a half or three hours.  Now at
 the beginning we did it.  Later we did it under 
the protection of darkness which was dangerous, uh uh 
hiding the Star and th
en at least to give 
our parents to see to see us and and the boy (c
learing throat) because uh uh communications over 
the telephone and so didn't  exist.  Uh in in the co
urse of of of that time,
 the restrictions became 
became became became  more uh rigi d and also then uh 
to come back to that order to the heads of 
the Jewish community, not to ma ke room for the people who had to uh make their apartments 
available, to provide them with ot
her shelter...there started the firs
t deportations to the east.  Uh 
we were not fully aware what...and I I uh uh uh trie
d to get information wherever I could, but uh 
don't forget that at this time you had no public pr
ess anymore.  Uh uh the press was completely 
controlled.  There were no letters to
 the editor or free speech or fr
ee writing and so and certainly 
the press did not report about anything like that 
so it were mostly rumors you had follow in in 
order to find out what was going on, but the de
portations started firs
t with the with the 
deportations of elderly people who 
were not uh in the in the...part
 of the forced labor program, 
because they considered them as uh as disposable 
and so transports went to first to to the ghetto 
in Lodz, or what they called, what they cal
led, the Germans, ________ and other places like 
Riga, Kovno, Minsk, and some  of these transports
, as we know from from from infor mation 
later, never arrived.  I uh uh uh...it's difficult to sa
y how did I react.  I know we were exposed to 
a development over which we had no control.  I rea
lized that  uh all my attempts to save myself 
and my fa mi ly, or to save my fa mily and myself 
had been in vain and, therefore, we we had to 
take whatever, whatever...I can...only had to hope th
at uh the military operations would result in 
a defeat of Germany and that only 
in the course of that defeat we 
could hope to be free again, so 
that means all our...it was my thinking about su
rvival was to see that that uh Germany was 
defeated.  Uh certainly there were, especially
 at the beginning, uh ma ny of our friends and 
some how we still tried to meet and exchange uh 
infor mation about the military situation and so 
we were convinced that Germa
ny was invincible, and there was 
not only of...then when you read 
today the the reports which came out from the fath
er of of Joe Kennedy, he also thought more or 
less that uh uh uh the western world is...and Russia 
is de feated and that uh Germany will be will 
be victorious.  Uh but we uh...I 
pers....personally must say uh I wa
s a great believer in in in 
whatever Churchill said.  Not wh
atever, but but his way of of 
t e lling the the people, you know, 
we will we will never surrender.  We will fight 
at the beaches.  We  will fight wherever we...we 
will never surrender.  This gave me  hope.  Also 
my expectation that one
 day uh public opinion in 
in America, which was rather isolationist, mi ght
 change and become  awa r e that Germany is not 
only a danger for Europe but also for for for Amer
ica in the long run, so uh and also that that 
especially after Germany uh attacked Russia, th
at there was a certain 
parallel for anybody who 
knew history, that when Napoleon tr
ied to uh to uh to fight Russia,
 that wa s end of his of his 
Empire, so I I was convinced that uh in spite of all the the mi litary mi ght Germany ha d 

developed, that uh uh it could not
 last.  The question only was how
 long?   And in this respect 
also I...how did did I know.  We  wer e  cut off fr
om the world.  We  we couldn't see uh uh any any 
news objectively.  Whatever we saw in the head
lines...and by the way we were not even allowed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
29 
 
to to buy a paper.  A neighbor of mi ne brought 
me  a paper once in a while, but that was all 
regulated  _______ and uh only the suc...the success 
was reported but defeat were not.  But uh 
then when I was in in this in this labor gang, 
if I may call it, and uh th
e attacks by the air force 
became stronger after Hitler had proclaimed and_____ had proclaimed already that the British 
were defeated.  It gave me  no hope, and my wife
 also the same way, that
 in the long run uh uh uh 
there must co me  a turn, and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh 

changed the whole situation by the 
defeat of Rommel in Afr i ca and es
pecially after the defeat of 
Stalingrad.  Uh this gave me  a tremendous hope 
and gave all of us a tremendous hope, but this 
was a time already when one transpor t after the ot
her left, for instance, 
Berlin, and the question 
was how long will it...when when when will when 
will the sword come  down on us.  Uh I had uh 
uh in this labor gang in which...where we were 
working, there was one me mber, a Jewish fellow 
who worked with us, who was uh what we called a 
privileged Jew.  That means he didn't have to 
carry the the yellow badge, the Star of David, b
ecause he was ma rried to a non-Jewess and their 
children were educated as as uh Christians, so he
 had still the right to 
uh to keep a radio, and 
with him we  could arrange...I say with him, with
 some  friends in that labor gang, that during the 
night he should get up and certainly that wa
s some thing which was uh...the threat of death 
penalty if he would be caught...to listen to 
BBC L ondon and and and to the German service to 
find out what the situation was.  He did it under 
the condition that we w
ould provide him in the 
black ma rket with with coffee because he said 
when he had to get up during the night and he 
couldn't find sleep imme diately, in 
the morning he was dead tired so he needs real coffee in order 
to survive the day.  This we could do.  And I I...I 
said I was one of them who was instrume ntal in 
this, so every morning when we came, he whispe
red to us what he had heard during the night, 
and in this respect uh we, or I was fully familiar with the pr ogress of uh the Russian ar my in 

Stalingrad and of the other defeat of the 6t
h German army under  ____ in St alingrad and 
especially when when when it came  to an end 
with the with the loss of approxima tely three 
hundred thousand German soldiers, so the quest i
on came, how long will they be able?  Would 

that mean the end of it and how fast would w
ould the end came .  Uh but uh uh on the other hand, 
uh the the the Nazis, in spite of of uh these military developments, continued with thei r 

deportations.  In December 1942, my parents were 
deported.  Uh I was...on the way home  I tried 
to to see them.  Then I was told that uh uh the Ge
stapo had come , had taken them on short notice.  
Uh later I found out that they we
re in a collection cente
r which was in the for mer Jewish old age 
home.  I was able to get them some food, pray
er book and so on, but then in a short time they 
were...this uh uh home  was was cleaned out and la
ter then I found out that my parents, blessed 
me mory, we re were in one of the first transports
 which went from Berlin
 directly, di rectly to 

Auschwitz, and certainly in Ausc
hwitz uh uh uh they they obviously
 got murdered the the fi rst 
uh mo me nt when they arrived. 

 
Question:  How did you feel when they were taken? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257

Answer:  When they were taken?   Certainly I fe
lt lost and and and call
 it depressed, but still I 
must say my  my power of resistance was still 
there because I had...together with my wife, we 
had...call it we made a pledge, call 
it an oath, whatever it is...th
at we will not try...we will not 
give in, that whatever the circ
umstances, we will try to to to hold out.  And and and uh uh though 
we we have no means to communicate with the outside worl d, with relative s and fr iends left  in 
the western world, and so being alone and and but st
ill uh this spark of life was still ther e, that  uh 
in spite of everythi ng that we will try to to  rema in
 alive, last not least to 
tell the tale, to tell our 
story later.  Still we didn't  know
 at this time about Auschwitz, so when I came  to the apartment 
and and a neighbor of my parents told me , told us
, certainly I I I was I was shocked.  More than 
shocked, and and and it was almost...uh it didn't si
nk in immediately, that this...that I would 
never see them again, and that th
is this was the last...when they
 were when they were taken 
away, we couldn't ma nage to see them in the ol
d age home, because this was closely guarded by 
the by the SS, so uh it didn't occur to me immediatel
y, but certainly it affected me , but I said to 
myself I do not like to to that
 this bad news, the terrible ne
ws should overcome you or  should 
should should paralyze me .  I woul
d like...I would I would try what
ever I can to survive, to 
survive this monster, and uh uh I th
ink this is the spirit which which certainly I've tried to carry 
forward and also later, so uh when when...that 
was in December uh and then I think it was early 
in February, after the defeat in in in St al
ingrad, ______ ma de a speech to which I listene d 
inofficially, because as I told you, 
we were one of the last to ha ve a radi o...when he said well, uh 

uh certainly Stalingrad could not 
deny that this wa s some  kind of a defeat, but now uh it...the 
time has come for the totalitaria
n...total war and uh the time  has co
me  also to uh to uh uh ma ke a 
final uh...to to get even with the 
with the domestic enemy, with the internal enemy, and he used a 
certain expression which is __________, which 
means now uh people arise and storm uh uh 
uh...start in other words to uh to 
uh...like like uh I think it was as a 
parallel in history like uh in 
Paris in 1870 when the the ____ I th
ink they call it...to to have an 
uprising of the people in order 
to save Hitler and the the regime .  And uh soon th
ereafter, and I was still 
working in that labor 
gang and it was still ______, and though America had 
entered already the war, uh we didn't feel 
the effect of it imme diately because  they had to
 ge t inst alled in England and they had started 
with the first air raids, but not towards Berlin.  
Uh and then my sister was also supposed to be 
deported but since she wa s a (clear
ing throat) skilled st
enographer and writer, they took her out 
to do secretarial service in the collection center, so
 she was able to help me to get something to 
my parents there.  Uh and then we were...uh one 
transport after the other left Berlin.  So me  
cards...post cards, inte
resting enough, arrived from the people who had ma naged to throw post 
cards out of their wagons and none of them certa
inly knew exactly where they were going.  We  
heard rumors about uh...and I heard rumors about
 uh uh events in Poland, about the the attack, 
about the ghettos, about the murder uh uh...the uh
 killing actions in in
 these areas, but don't 
forget (clearing throat) that all th
is could not be confirme d.  This wa
s just  to the same extent that 
I asked my friend who listened to to to th
e radio, to BBC, wh at does BBC London say, and he 
said uh nothing.  There is a certain uh uh uh app
eal or certain address which was delivered by 
______ where he indicated that uh Jews were take
n away from France and so, but no hard facts 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
31 
 
are available, and uh I also uh still had contact wi
th my people of the of the Jewish organization, 
and when I had a chance I saw the head of that, at this time  was Paul
 Epstein (ph) and we 
exchanged some  more infor mation, but all the info
rmation only said that th
ere is a turn, but but 
we came to the conclusion (clearing throat) for 
the Jewish situation in
 Germany, it anyhow mi ght 
come  too late.  And uh uh then in in uh at the 
end of February, early 
in March, uh from one day 
to the other, Berlin was was...t
here there started...there was...
came the end of the so so-called 
final solution.  The SS, interesting enough, 
the elite SS called the __________ of Hitler, 
occupied in the morning all fact
ories where Jews were working in
 these groups, and certainly for 
them it was easy to get to to them, because they 
were working in groups.  I for one reason or the 
other had been advised the night
 before...said stay home .  You 
never know what's  goi ng on, and I 
was staying home , and uh then uh 
a neighbor came running and said I 
just heard they have taken 
away my husband.  He was working there and ther
e and don't know where he is.  It's  terrible.  
What is your...what what what can you do?   There'
s nothing.  You just have to to wait and see.  
So I tried to read and to to to to even write a 
letter to a friend in Sweden, because with Sweden 
there was st ill...since it was neutral uh you could 
have still uh an exchange of letters though it 
was censored, so uh uh and then uh uh in the 
afternoon of that day, 
two uh uh policemen who 
were me mb ers of the Gestapo came  and told us
 that uh uh we  we are under custody and we uh 
we uh in ten mi nutes we should leave.  Now in c
onnection with all these transports, my then wife 
uh had prepared a knapsack with a
ll kinds of things we thought w
ould be helpful when we would 
go to the east to some  kind of a labor camp and s o what we expected, and had some  s o me  uh 
underwear and some  books and the bible and and a 
chess set and so on, and certainly things for 
the for the boy, and uh had that ready so in or
der to grab it whenever whenever the occasion 
would arise.  And uh as I say in
 that afternoon they came, and ga
ve us ten mi nutes and my son 
was sleeping, so we ma naged some how to...we all,
 after all, spoke the 
same  language, to tell 
them after all we have to get him ready and should give us some time and uh with some  

hesitation they said al ri ght, we'll wait.  To talk 
to them was almost imposs i ble.  Uh uh I tried but 
uh I knew it was dangerous because for these were people who were fanatic Nazis and and and 

they took...uh take out their wrat
h against you on the spot.  They
 had the right to kill you on the 
spot and nobody...nobody would would take them uh to 
court for that.  So uh then we took our 
knapsacks and we took our son and and and then we
 went down.  We  wer e  living in an in an 
apartment in the back of a 
big building and uh uh when we came down we  saw a truck uh 
surrounded by SS guards with rifles.  It certai
nly was not a pleasant
...pleasant uh uh mome nt, 
because we certainly di dn't  know what was goi
ng to happen.  And uh then we were...when we 
were ascende d this truck and saw othe r Jewish pe
ople because  they all had the star and they all 
had the same  destiny that their husbands had 
been taken but uh uh uh the...since they had the 
address of these people at home, they were pickin
g up the people in their in their home s .  Those 
they didn't found in the factories, they found at ho me  and then we were cruising around in in in 

in Berlin.  It was in March, early in March.  It wa
s cold.  It was...it was ra
ining.  It was mi serable 
and then they stopped and cruising and we were 
absolutely uncertain, but I had the wonderful 
feeling at least my wife and my son was with me . 
 The others were in th
at unfortunate situation 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
32 
 
that they were separated fr om their families and uh also I must say my then wife was in a rather 
good mood and let's say whatever will come , will co
me , as long as we can stay together, and uh 
then we were taken to a to a big place in the mi
ddle of the night.  Don't for get that Berlin was 
completely blacked out on account of
 the air raid sit...of the air si
tuation, and uh then from that 
big place we were transferred...tr
ansferred to another 
place uh where also my parents had been 
before.  It's a collection point.  Also in betw
een we were released for a day or two to our 
apartment again uh uh and we could do some thing because we had uh red arm bands to help uh 

to to be...to bring some  food to a place,
 but that was only very mi nor.  There was 
nothing...nothing really where you could say uh you can 
help people.  We  were all exposed to 
the same ...to the same  danger.  So uh uh and then 
uh uh again we were we were  called in and we 
were taken in to that place in in the old 
age home, and on March 11, 1943, we were we were 
(clearing throat) ma de part of the transpor
t.  Interesting enough, two days before we 
became...and I became the witness of the first majo
r air raid of the Amer
ican air force against 
Berlin.  As long as the Br itish air force came, cer
tainly I mean they had tried what they do, but 
they are...the the dama ge they were they were 
inflicting on on on the on th
e buildings in Berlin 
were rather mi nor, though they were there I m
ean and it was...you never knew where they would 
hit and what would be hit, and we were part 
of that, but when the American bombers came , I 
mean there was...there for the first time I realized that was a ma ssive attack and you'll see when 
we when we  uh looked around that Berlin was 
really burning, and we had to hope that the 
railway uh uh would be destroyed, but thatdidn't happen.  And then on the 11...uh March 11th 
we were ma de part of of that transport.  Uh we 
were taken together with..
.I think we were all in 
all a thousand people out of th
at uh collection point.  Men...w
o...men, women, children, elderly, 
young...and uh my sister was with me, with us and 
also luckily some  of our friends from the 
youth move me nt and we  tried to stick together.  We were uh shipped to 
a freight yard within 

Berlin and there were forced to
 board one of these cattle cars, 
uh approxima tely I think a hundred 
people in a car, so we could could hard...we coul
dn't lie.  We  could hardly sit...mostly stand.  
There was just a hole for for for...there was a hole
 in the car for ventilat
ion (clearing throat) and 
one bucket there for for hygiene purposes and uh...but st
ill I would say that I, 
in spite of that, and 
also my then wife, had a feeling well, we'll ta
ke it...we can take it, because none of us uh was 
aware what was going to happen.  Uh we didn't 
know where we were going.  Uh I only noticed 
on my watch that exactly at four o'clock in th
e afternoon this train le
ft and was moving east, 
because I was fa miliar with the geography of Berl
in and Germany, so we know we were were uh 
going to the east, and uh as a ma tte
r of fact,  uh since we were together with other other friends, 
in order to to not kill times but to some how 
alleviate the si tuation within ourselves some how 
started to sing Jewish songs we had uh l
earned uh uh in the in the youth moveme nt.  
___________.  How nice is it to to be with friends, 
under those conditions.  It's  absurd today, 
you know, but you see this was still pa
rt of the of the mood we were in, and I reme mbe r  that also 
my wife also wrote some of these cards which were very safe because you could throw them 
through the hole and some ti me s they were picked
 up and people uh then ma iled them.  Uh it was 
Friday night and uh when it became  dark, interes
ting enough, one of the ladies there uh aware of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
33 
 
this was a Friday night, uh took out some  candl
es she had prepared, was lighting the candles, was 
bless...blessing the candles, and and and uh expr
essing the prayers, you know, to welcome the 
Sabbath, and you know, the...later very often 
thought about this, you know, what...how how 
absurd life can be that, you know, here ther
e was a group, just a death wagon of a hundred 
people, most probably ninety percent of them di
d not live to see the next evening anymore, but 
still riding in that car, they were blessing G
od and welcoming uh the Sabb
ath, in that mobile uh 
prison going from Berlin to we still didn't know wh
ere.  So we traveled all night and uh then I 
realized in the morning that we
 were going via Breslau (ph) in 
this area and uh uh came to Upper 
Salasia and uh then uh in the afternoon, almost 
twenty-four  hours later, we uh we stopped in a 
kind of a railway station uh and there I saw for th
e fi rst time written the name Auschwitz.  I was 
not aware what Auschwitz was in spite of the f
act that I had uh uh listened to to to BBC London, 
had tried to get all the infor ma
tion I could in Berlin.  We  kne
w about uh ghettos in Riga.  We  
knew about the ghetto in in in Lodz.  Auschw
itz...I didn't know what it was.  And uh obviously 

also at this time  uh uh ne ither BBC L ondon nor 
any other information uh sources, had any any 
concrete idea.  Auschwitz was new.  So uh uh wh
en the train stopped uh they they they the doors 
was opened and we were all some how stiff and so 
it was a cold night and so and so, but we were 
driven out.  There were...there
 were SS guards with the with th
e uh uh uh sticks and uh yelling 
like animals, and uh beating people out of the cars.
  Uh there I also saw when we left our uh 
wagon that two of our people who were with 
us or three ha d committed suicide, so uh uh 
because they probably...it was it was too much fo
r them, and then outside  we were we were 
assembled on a platform.  Uh we we re ordered to leave all our uh bel
ongings there, all our 
knapsacks we  had prepared carefully and whatever 
it was remained there, and then they ordered 
us to uh line up in different groups, me n, uh wome
n with children, and wome n.  And this was the 
mo me nt wh en when when I was se
parated from my wife and my ch
ild, and this is where my wife 
then said well, this is the mo me nt I have...I was
...I will be ...I was afraid of.  As long as we were 
together...and sure enough uh uh this was the last
 uh uh day I have seen her and my child.  We  
were lining up and uh uh there stand a ma n in a in a very elegant SS uniform.  Later I came  to 

understand it was Dr. Mengele, and uh when he
 approached he asked only how old are you, 
what's  your profession, and then he directed people
 to the left or to th
e right with his thumb.  
And he asked me  how old.  What
's  your profession?   I certai
nly did not say that I was an 
admi nistrator or a law student.  I said I was a weld
er, and he directed me  to one group.  I had lost 
track of my wife and my  son, but then also what
 I saw and what was completely new to me  was 
all of a sudden wome n in SS uniform with with
 their pistol holsters, you know, where they...the 
pistol uh dangling, and they al
so prepare...behaved like anim
als, and they uh uh uh were 
especially busy with the women with children 
and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw 
people in in a certain unifor m I 
had never seen before, with stri
pped clothing and peculiar kind of 
a of a of a cap, and uh so then trucks uh were were driving up and one group of people, 
especially the wome n wi th children and the elde rl
y were put on one truck and we still had to wait 
and uh then this truck left and 
it so happened that my wife an
d my my my son had...they were 
sitting or were standing at the end of that tr
uck, and my wife was some
how waving to me .  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
34 
 
that was the last I've seen of he
r.  We had to wait and then we re
 were were pressed into another 
truck, and though we thought it was 
full already they they uh they
 still pushed I don't know how 
ma ny peopl e into...it was less...it was worse than sardines.  Uh a
nd there certainly everywhere 
were SS guards.  We  tried to uh to uh to uh sp
eak to them, but interesting enough they hardly 
spoke German because they were what they
 called _______ which means ethnic Germans, but 
their ma in major language was Polish, but they 
had volunteered obviously for the SS and did this 
kind of duty.  So we couldn't find out anything from
 them and then we were driven away from 
that railway station and passed by a tremendous uh
 uh area of industrial bu
ildings.  I don't know 
how ma ny buildings we could see that was under 
construction.  We  couldn't understand what it 
was.  We  didn't know...after all, we still didn't 
know where we were.  And uh then after having 
passed this area of industrial buildings, uh we 
entered...we...all of a sudden I saw a a camp 
surrounded by by barbed wire, with watch towers
 and SS guards with machine uh guns, ma chine 
pistols, and when we drove into this I said to 
my  friends who were standing next to me  from the 
youth move me nt and luckily we were still sticking t
ogether...may God help us to get out of here 
alive.  So uh that's the mome nt when when we 
had arrived and I had arrived in Auschwitz.  What 
happened to my wife and my son I did not know.  The others didn't know what happened to their 
people, so and then we were ordered uh to descen
t this truck and and and 
uh were driven into to 
to some  barracks and were ordered to undress comple
tely, only to keep our our shoes, our glasses 
certainly, our belts and uh then the SS orde
red us to take off our rings, our watches, 
whatever...and uh uh then we were were...I togeth
er with these other people and we were 
approxima tely I would say two hundred people in 
this in this group, from
 Berlin...uh were were 
led into a shower.  We  were not 
quite clear what what it was.  It
 was cold.  It was mi serable but 
even later when we...when the water came dow
n although it was cold 
it was some how, it 
was...believe it or not some  kind of a  relief after 
this trip that we hadn't eaten.  We  had not...we 
were not in in very good shape, but
 in all tense (ph)...I I reme mber 
that everything that I...I said 
at this time  to myself, register in your mi nd wh
atever is going on.  With
 God's help one day you 
mi ght be be be called to give evidence about th
at, so some how I I tried and not to forget and uh 
then we...after that...in that...then we
 were in that shower.  A ma n ca
me  al so with a uniform, with 
a stripped uniform, and we asked him who are 
you and he said I'm from Ha mburg.  I am a 
political prisoner, a Jew but a politi
cal prisoner.  I have taken part 
in the uh fight of the of the 
Spanish Republicans against Franco.  I was ca
ught there and and and and delivered by the 
Spanish to Germany.  I am in the camp already four
 years.  You have arrived in Auschwitz.  The 
camp here is name d Buna.  You will be working 
for a big factory where they are trying to 
produce artificial rubber and it is under th
e under the admi nistration of _______, and _______ 
for us had a special name.  It was like  DuPont
 in...or British British Chemical and so it was a 
tremendous firm.  It 's stocks were widely held, 
also by Jewish stockholders
, so this is what you 
are going to do, and we asked what
's  about our chil...wives and ch
ildren.  He said don't ask about 
them because uh I can't  tell you.  We  don't ask questions.  We  are here already.  You are lucky 

that you came now.  We, the old guards, the old 
timers, called old-timers are here already for 
years.  We  have gone through Buchenwald and 
Dachau and Sa xonhausen and now Auschwitz, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
35 
 
try to ma ke your best.  Tr y to be strong.  Try to 
take it.  Otherwise you are lost, and uh then after 
the shower was over, we we were given the same  
kind of uh dresses these people had.  It was not 
fitting, you know...it was terrible.  And some  caps also
 with the same  stripes, and then we were 
led to one of the barracks we had seen there in 
that camp and a man who called hi mself the elder, 
the block elder, blockaltester, block elder rece
ived us.  He was a pol
itical prisoner who was uh 
allied with the communist party 
and so and had been caught very 
early, so he had already seven 
or eight years of i mprisonme nt behind him, and 
he said I want you to be clean.  I want you to 
____ and so and we were then given our our beds, 
which me a ns in this barracks there were rows 
of bunks, three tiers and there was...there was a 
thin blanket and the so-called ma ttress was a 
straw sack and uh and uh we were given to understa
nd that this is our place where we  can sleep.  
There was no place to leave your things.  Ther
e was...there was uh no place uh to rest, to sit 
down, so uh...and then I realized th
at uh...the events were so fast
 and so over-bearing and so 
shocking that it was not possible 
for me  to fully analyze what was going on, but uh I realized one 
thing that certainly uh I I...tha
t the Nazis had tried to dehuma n
ize me  by taking away all my 
private...my most private things
, my hair, my clothing, to ma ke me  a number and that I was 
degraded to to become a slave, 
that I was a prisoner, that uh I wa
s not any more able to do what I 
wanted to do, that I had to uh follow uh orders
...how nonsensical they we
re...and uh that that all 
this in the name , I said, of Ger man civilizati
on...I was puzzled.  And also uh especially then 
came a little bit...got used to this...came  to the 
realization that there was no way out because uh 
certainly the camp was was was surrounded by mo
re than one fence of barbed wire, was 
electrically loaded, that to run away would be 
impossible and even if so, in a Polish area...it was 
still a Polish population where you don't know the 
language...was hopeless, so that the only hope 
which was there is to to live to to see uh th
at Germany was militar
ily defeated, and had 
surrendered.   
 
Question:  I think we should stop he
re..._____________.  We'r e at a good stopping point. 
 

END OF T APE 3  
 
...I had to get out and uh one of the first things 
you learn in a concentrat
ion camp...one  of the first 
things was to to ma ke your beds, and the German
s, the Nazis, in this respect uh they had an 
obsession for for for orderly uh be
d building.  It had to be done
 in a mathematical, straight 
fashion and since I I had the bunk on top I was th
e first to have to do it because other...the 
people...and I had to stand on the on the rim of 
the of the second tier a
nd the first tier, so, 
therefore, I had to finish it firs
t and then the others could do it. 
 Now that was a thing, and then 
we were...I was treated to my fi
rst uh breakfast there which consisted of an awfully tasting coffee 
and a piece of bread and and that was all.  Oh, 
a little piece of ma rg...of sausage or so...I  don't 
know, but anyhow this first day was a day when when
 we we re registered and and and also again 
people came and asked what was your profession and 
I stick...was sticking to my lie that all my 
life I have been nothing but a welder, because pe
ople had told me  who had been in in a camp 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
36 
 
before in the action that the Nazis despis
ed tremendously any people looking some what 
intellectually or or professional or
 so the worst were the were th
e lawyers and and and when they 
found a lawyer they really...they they
 mi streated them very very badly.  So I said I was a welder 
and then we got we got...uh I got my number, 
which was 107984.  Uh we had to...I had to...I got 
some  patches of of of stuff of linen and and ha
d to to sew it on my uniform, and also then uh 
some body c a me  and tattooed this number on my left 
arm, so uh that means I I I...and I still have 
that...uh which means that you were completely uh uh...you were...you have become  a number 
and one of the fi rst things I said to myself is
 I would like to become  not a number.  I had a 
number but I'd like not to  become a number, so stil
l ther e was that spirit of resistance if possible.  
And then on that first day also I I went th
rough some thing which never uh uh experienced 
before, what they call appell.  The Ge rmans and the 
Nazis, they are in this
 respect and especially 
at this time , they had obstinen
t appell, you know, and counting was one of their hobbies.  Uh and 
they had it at least twice a day, so we were all le
d to a big place, a big square and there we had to 
line up...our block...in in rows of five and ha
d to wait until an SS ma n came, and there 
were...were the head of the camp, the SS that was
...the SS stormfurher which means captain.  Uh 
since it was cold, he had the priv
ilege of wearing a nice fur coat, uh a military fur coat, so we 
were counted again and again and again, and uhuh then uh the next day, it was the first day 

when when when I was I was uh uh commanded, af
ter the appell in the morning, to go to a 
certain komma ndo they called it, working...wor
king uh squad or working platoon, and uh the 
newcomers had no choice.  They were attached to 
a very special one.  I only later I found this 
one of the kommands to uh to wear us down, 
to grind us down, uh which we called _______, the 
the killing...killing komma ndo, themurder komma ndo, uh number four.  So then we uh we we 
we we walked out, again in military order, uh alwa
ys five because that wa s easier to count.  We  
were counted at the uh square before.  We  were 
counted when we ma rched out and at this time  
the SS uh uh guards were walking with us left and right, so uh in other words each komma ndo 

had so and so ma ny SS guards attached to th
em, and uh it was quite a
....quite a distance we 
walked and uh...well, I was still able
 to do that.  Of course I had st
ill a certain strength in me , and 
then uh uh then we were...we entered th
e factory area where where you had these 
num...nume rous buildings there under
 construction.  Uh streets we
re not completed.  There was a 
lot of mud, ____ soil, especially
 since it was a cold morning, 
it was all flour (ph) and we 
had...we had just the this very th
in kind of dress and and and it was not easy and uh then I was 
led together with the ot hers uh to a certai
n place where we had to unload uh uh uh railway 
wagons of me tal and cement and so on.  And this was done mostly uh not in an ordinary way, but 

running.  I mean me tal...you cannot...big beams 
you cannot transport by running but but for 
instance when you have a sack of ceme nt, then they
 wanted you to run because it had to be fast.  
And also for the first time I became acquainted 
with an institution I di dn't know uh uh before, 
that each kommando ha d a a a inma te leader call
ed kapo.  Where this term originated I don't 
know.  I have never found out.  It
 come s from Italy some how.  Uh but they called it kapo and it 
has been...had entered the the language of the c
oncentration camps, so you had a kapo as the 
leader of the...and he had certain forema ns to 
to to help him, especially in bigger komma nds, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
37 
 
bigger bigger bigger kommandos, but then you had th
e SS also so they all then uh uh were 
around us to to watch what we are doing and how 
we are doing it, that it 
went fast enough and so 
on.  And uh I reme mber that on that fi rst day uh wh
en we we re when we were doing this kind of 
work and I had done part of it in Berlin so it 
was not completely new to me ...I I saw that one 
Jewish fellow of another kommando uh throw hims
elf in front of a locomotive of a small uh 
engine to commit suicide so that  was the fi rst th
at I I saw there uh and it was the fi rst which was 
followed by ma ny many more.  So uh when it came  
to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break, 
some  trucks came with some  watery soup which wa
s called buna (ph) soup because the name of 
that factory was Buna and it was provided by th
e firm which they think was a tremendous uh 
tremendous gain for us.  It was very often abso
lutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing 
but just water uh uh with some  some  vegetable re
mnants or so.  It's  awful.  And so uh and 
since...and also we had...there was...yeah...one 
of our possessions was uh a bowl which you 
always had to carry with us.  That was your 
only possession and a spoon.  When we we got the 
soup, we couldn't sit down and so it all has to be.
..had to eaten standing up and then after a short 
while the the work continued up to the very end 
of the day.  So at the beginning...I mean it was 
hard but but but I also considered bearable, bu
t then, you know, not a couple of days later...was 
early in March, uh terr ible rain stor ms hit the ar
ea and the area became  mu ddier than before so 
the work became more difficult, es
pecially when you have to carry
 these cement bags.  That was 
not...the paper was not of the best quality so 
they very often broke and when you mi x ceme nt 
with water, you know, it it become s very hard ca
ked and it wa s setting also on your clothing and 
so...now the other problem was that I couldn't cha
nge...change the clothing.  I I I...there was no 
way to clean yourself.  There was so-called wa
shroom but the washroom was there for hundreds 
of people.  To get to the faucets was almost i m
possible, so to keep clean was one of the most 
difficult things, and also ther
e was always the danger uh that you you would acquire lice which 
then would would uh result in t
yphus.  So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that 
was one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb  anymore 
because you had no hair, but you even didn't also
 didn't have a towel.  You had...really you had 
practically...you were devoid of any things uh uh 
which ma ke s funda me ntals of of life.  Who 
speaks about about books and paper 
and and...it didn't exist, simply did not exist.  You were 
really uh a slave.  You were rented out by the 
SS to ______.  I was, therefore, a slave working uh 
uh uh for the benefit of the SS for ________ and I was 
aware of the fact th
at I was allowed to 
live only as long as I as I was able to do this 
kind of work.  The mo ment I became wea k or the 
mome nt I would I would uh contract
 any any illnesses and so that
 was the end, so therefore I I 
also tried very hard to uh to keep myself clean
 but, of course, I mean especially when you had 
these rains and you came  back in
 the evening and the the uh th
e uh so-called uniform was was 
covered with with the ceme nt dust.  You went
 to bed and you were you were wet.  Everything 
was wet.  So how to sleep under those c
onditions I don't know, but but, you know, obviously 
huma n beings can can can can can can tolerate 
a lot.  Uh ma ny of our people...I wouldn't say 
ma ny...some  of our people simply said enough is e
nough and uh I reme mb er distinctly that that 
uh uh starting the third or fourth 
day uh certain of the people who we
re also in our transport and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
38 
 
were still in that same  kommando, 
simply when we were walking out of the camp, ran what they 
called ___ so the person had ran away, tried to ran away and then the SS started to shoot 
imme diately and shooting him to death.  Uh and the SS loved to do that because for any for any 
victim I think they were paid at this time tw
enty or twenty-five ma rks and a bottle of of of 
cognac and so on and a day or two of rest.  And 
I reme mber for instance we were walking uh one 

one morning.  It was the fourth or fifth morni
ng.  A father was walking with his son and the 
father then when we we re out of the camp, gave th e rest of his bread and whatever he had to his 
son and said uh uh I don't need it any more, gave it to
 his son, ran out in order to be shot, in the 
presence of his son.  And uh uh uh this I saw. 
 These first days uh especially became the the 
worst I would say in my life 
and very often when we came home , you know, we...after you came 
back from the factory, you were counted again. 
 You were counted when you entered the camp.  
You were counted again in the evening, and  
uh this some times could last uh hours and hours 
because Germany was the place where where le
t us say where where scientists work on 
mathe matics and make progress, but these people
 were not good in ma th, and very often when 
the when the when the numbers didn't  didn't didn't jive, we had to wait and and and and they did 
not uh let us uh let us go before 
everything was was just just right 
to the last ma n, so it happened, 
for instance, I reme mber that one evening of th
e fourth or the fifth, 
one of the me n of my 
transport just collapsed in front 
of us.  Uh we he was a cantor, a ma n I knew well because I had 
attended his service.  We isma n (ph) was his 
name.  A wonderful, powerful voice, and and and 

and well, highly-educated ma n.  He collapsed 
and when the appell wa
s taken and the SS ma n 
came and kicked him wi th his with his foot and he could hardly move and uh then when the 

appell was...when the roll call was over, uh we de
cided we had to take him to the so-called uh 
emergency..the krackenbaugh, the hospital and uh it 
was not easy for us to carry him but we did 
it because we  thought it's the only wa y to help h
im, and then on the way, which was quite a long 
way over there at the end of the uh place, he expired and he di ed in our hands and uh uh this was, 
I must say, the first uh casualty I witnessed of some body I knew well, and then from t his day on, 
ma ny many things happened because the resi
st ance, the power of resistance some how 
evaporated.  How I did it I don't know.  I I thought
 out all kind...I I also
 felt that I I became  
weaker.  As a ma tter of fact, one morning I fainted and my good friends uh lifted me  up and the 
whole day was difficult for me .  Uh but I some how
 ma naged.  It was one of these mi racles, but 
uh but uh uh after one month I would say, from th
e two hundred and twenty or so we had been 
when we we re newcome r s, only I think a hundred a
nd fifty had survived, but to save the other's 
place, later, after libera
tion when I tried to find out how ma ny 
of our transport had survived, of 
the thousand who had left Berlin, not more than 
six, and I am one of those.  So uh uh I myself 
asked the question, how long would I be able to to to
 tolerate that and uh also
 uh we were cut off.  
We didn't know what what was th
e latest on the front.  We were 
waiting for the second front and 
didn't know any...hear anything because we were 
cut off from any news.  We didn't hear 
anything about uh what was going on on the eastern 
front, so I said how l
ong can it last.  And I 
reme mber that one mo ment then when I went to
 the toilet, I found a piece of newspaper that 
probably an SS ma n had left there, and it so ha
ppened that I took into my...you know, pockets I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
39 
 
didn't have, but...yeah...was hiding it under my
 underwear and and, you know, we had to be 
careful to to to handle this a
nd it so happened when I was in the block with my friends I said 
watch that some body should discover us and uh I read
 it and it so happened that was a piece with 
the report of the of the German Wi ermacht saying 
that they had been driven out of Krackow (ph) 
which gave me  an idea that the front, the Ru
ssian front, was advancing, but more I didn't know, 
but some how it it added again, you know, to the sp
ark of life and uh then uh there was another 
day when I almost lost uh my my
 my uh belief that I would be able
 to ma ke it.  In our group was 
a ma n who uh uh was very active also in our yo
uth move me nt.  He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil 
employee, and he was a ma n with 
a beautiful voice.  He had studi
ed music because he wanted to 
become  a cantor, and he had been in another 
komma ndo and uh I me t him and he was desperate.  
I said to him uh...his name  was Fritz Shafer (ph) ...uh what happened.  He said I've had enough.  I 

can't  take it any longer.  I said
 what are you going to do.  He said
 I have uh...I was sick.  I went 
to the hospital.  After three days
 they threw me  out.  I can hard
ly stand on my feet and I don't 
like to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rath
er take my own life, so I argued with him.  I said 
Fritz, how can you do it.  Think what we have gone
 through.  Think what we
 have been taught.  
How can you take your own life.  After all, you are obs
ervant Jew.  It's  un-Jewish.  He said, this 
is my decision.  I don't want to be to be to be
 kicked to death, because what happene d here...for 
this there is no provision in the 
bible and in in our scriptures, 
and the next day I heard in the 
morning whatever shooting going on during the ni
ght.  Very often the SS guards on the tower, 
they were some ti me s shooting because...to keep 
themselves awake let us say, and they could 
order you...they had these Jews that they saw some
thing in there for the...it was suspicious and 
therefore they were firing, so uh so we hear
d shooting constantly, and next day some body said 
you know, did you hear the shooting this morning.  
I said yes, what happened.  They said your 
friend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he 
tried to be admitted to the to the hospital again.  They didn't 
accept hi m, so he said under those conditions 
I I ____ went against the...you know, this was one 
of the ways in which people also put an end to th
eir mi sery.  They went 
to the to the wire and 
then the fellow from the  the gangster from the...the SS gangster from the watch tower was 
shooting because that was his order, so he went to 
the wire in order to be 
shot and and that's what 
happened.  And I reme mber it still...it was on Ap
ril 3rd, 1940...'43, soon after we arrived.  Uh so 
when I heard this, I must say I I I I was almost 
lost because I had lost  a battle and I saw the 
parallel and I was uh said...asking 
myself how long will we all be ab
le to make that, and then uh 
one day or two days later, all of a sudden ther
e was uh uh a special roll call that people should 
register again their their their 
uh profession, so that gave me  a
nother hope and uh there was what 
they called the labor service, ________.  Again re
gistered and I registered myself again as 
welder.  The uh reason wa s that the Ge rmans had lost on account of Stalingr ad a lot of 

ma npower, had uh uh inducted into the army also skilled labor, so they we
re short of labor, and 
obviously we re interested to to now some how in 
our in our skill, if you want to.  So I I I uh 

registered.  Nothing came  out of it but some ho
w it gave me some  hope , and there was another 
event which uh was of immense i mportance.  
All the time when when I was there at the 
beginning, we were constantly under the under th
e supervision of the SS gangsters, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
40 
 
were brutal, brutal, brutal uh 
uh beings.  I cannot say human beings.  So uh uh even, you know, 
when you wanted to go to the toilet and so you 
had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap 
and asking for permission, for his permission and so
 on and what they did in order to play around 
was very often to take, when you when you take o
ff your cap, take the cap and throw it away and 
when the mome nt when you...when the people wentto get, to collect th
e cap, then the SS ma n 
was shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and 
this this was the uh the situati
on the first couple of weeks. Also in connection with the 
Stalingr ad de feat uh they then came to the conc
lusion that they wanted to save ma npower and 

they organized the uh the uh guards in such a wa
y that they were surrounding completely the 
whole area of that industrial complex, so that when we ma rched out, when we got into into into 

the factory area, the SS stayed outside  uh keepin
g guard out...yeah, keeping guard outside but we 
ma rched in only with the kapos.  And that alle
viated certainly the situation some how because 
then the ka pos in order to keep their pos...their position who were very, ve ry rough with their 
own people...they were mostly German cri minals a
nd and anti-social elements and so they then 
were not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become  tougher with the...so this helped 

some how, but still it was no no no no solution and a
nd as I say, I I I I thought what what...still I 
was able to move but but I said some thing has to 
had to be done.  For instance, we were then...I 
was put in another komma ndo unde r the comma nd of a kapo who was a Polish criminal.  He had 

committed one or two murders uh and and he was such a huma n being the only regret he had that  
he had waited too long to murder his wife a
nd his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was 
taking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for 
one reason or  the ot her because uh...so uh he was 
a kapo there and he had uh used th
e foul language especially in 
Polish, because he was also was 
also one of these ethnic Germans who didn'
t know exactly where they belonged.  You know, 
they they they they they had 
a double standard.  They wanted to be Germans, and at the same  
time uh uh they wanted to to rema in with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head 
of a digging kommando, and that wa
s also that was that that uh he was called in a German 
expression was Juden Franz (ph). 
  Franz is a Ge rman na me , but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he 
got because  he was a grinder of Jews.  He ha
d shown so ma ny Jewish uh casualties on his 
conscious.  And he would always say, well I ha
d to do it in order to enforce the ____, and we 
were not prot ected.  There was no prot ected because
 not only had I lost  my
 my my name and my 
hair and my clothing and my fa m
ily...I also had had lost comp le
tely my my right to claim any 
huma n rights.  And uh that's what certainly thes
e these people, these gangsters knew very well 
that there wa s no protection and uh then one da
y uh the uh the uh...we were
 called again to the 
labor office, again for registration, but this tim
e in the presence of a 
representative of _________.  
And again we were asked what is youruh uh profession, name...uh not name , number and 

profession, and I said welder.  He
 was some how doubtful, for what reasons, but uh then he asked 
me  certain technical questions a
nd I was able to answer them, and then uh uh two days later I 
was transferred into a kommando wh
ere I I got out of this grindi
ng work of transport, digging, 
and all this and uh was attached 
to what they call a German me ister (ph) uh and uh uh the work 
was...and it was a great help...was 
to clean big plates which we
re used in the uh gasoline 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
41 
 
columns which had come  in order to uh to be inst
alled in the in the factory.  That gave me  a 
chance some how to to to to rest a little bit in be tween because I was not under the supe r...thi s the 
kapo there was a political prisoner 
fr om from _____ so uh I could re
cover a little bit.  The only 
thing which I dreaded very much that because of th
at I was transferred also into anot he r lage r, to 
another barracks and had not the daily contact with
 my friends there who were still doing work 
and as I in that terrible kommando there.  We
ll, uh so uh uh especially, as I say, uh uh at the 
beginning uh life or the day in 
in Auschwitz was simply a day 
of getting up, st
arting to run, uh 
being exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockalte
ster or kapo, so hardly be able to to sit, uh 
watching what what what uh left and right uh 
what what was happening so that it shouldn't 
happen to you and especially uh to to try to 
to do the work, which was not work, which was 
really slave work remi nding you some how of 
the illustrations you sa
w in the _____ when the 
Jews in in Egypt were building the pyrami ds.  Uh
 it, as I say, it improved some how, and I felt at 
least the improveme nt uh when when wh
en the SS guards were taken away... 
 

Question:  At  that point did you ma ke  a decision 
to try to ration your energy very carefully?   
How soon did you do that... 

 
Answer:  Especially when I when when I came to 
the conclusion that what 
little I had, I had to to 
stretch out my energy.  For instance, there was...
I don't know if it's right, but I got the bread in 
the morning.  I didn't eat it immediately.  I kept a 
little bit and kept it in my  pocket some how so 
that they say, when when it's dr
ier, then it has mo re nourishing value, or one instance I tried to 
uh to uh to uh...especially after the SS was taken 
away from the kommandos, to go to the to the 
toilet unobserved as often as possible to have to
 have a mi nute of rest, or for instance uh you 
know, uh uh we had as tool only our bowl and a a
nd a and a and a spoon.  Now I ca me to the 
conclusion in order to cut the bread...we had no 
knives certainly.  That 
was dangerous for the 
Germans, for the German state.  Uh I sharpened pa
rt of that of that spoo
n so that it was easier 
some how to cut in order to save energy and and a
nd this...and also uh uh uh what I tried in spite 
of all obstacles to to to rema in clean.  Uh because
 I realized that the mo me
nt I would give in, that 
could be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I 
was working for that fi rst German meister, uh 
uh who was who was mo re or less pleasant, uh uh b
ecause he treated me not as an inmate, as a 
heftling, as a slave.  He treated me  as some
body who was like a helper or uh...not in his category 
but as a helper and uh then I tr
ied, you know, to sit down as often 
as possible and to to relax to 
to...whenever I could and not to exert myself, do 
anything special, certainl
y not to run anymore 
and so to try to to to walk in a way that that
 I don't consume too much ener...energy.  Uh after a 
certain while I lost that job because there 
was a conflict between  _______ and the and the and 
the ______ which was doing this kind of work a
nd uh then I was uh uh handed over to another 
fellow who...as a welder...uh the German meister 
who ca me  from Saxony (ph) and he was a first 
class worker, but his religion as you have it ve
ry often in in Ge rmany...his whole religion was 
work.  He didn't understand anything about politics.  
His politics was work.  He didn't like it.  He 

didn't like the war but this doesn't  affect it.  He
 was just...as long as he could work, and he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
42 
 
very proud in his work, so at the be ginning it wa
s not so easy because I was not an accomplished 
welder, but I tried to learn from hi m and he realized
 that and I must say in 
all fairness, he treated 
me  like an equal.  And when he saw that I ma de
 progress in whatever he wanted me  to do, then 
he gave me  some  cigarettes uh which I didn't use 
certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes 
for bread which was very important, also to to
 get up some  more energy.  And uh uh so uh also 
what was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I 
worked with him I could work under a roof so 
that the elements...I wa s not exposed to the elem
ents.  I also reme mber that uh when I entered 
this building where I worked then, I for the first time in weeks I saw a mi rror, and I looked 
myself into the mi rror and I was aghast.  I was s
imply...I I I mean this was the worst, one of the 
worst things I must say that happened to me . 
 I didn't recognize myself anymore, certainly 

without hair, unshaven you know, because we had 
a chance only to to be  shaven once a week, 
and  I  said for goodness sake, what happened to
 you.  Uh uh but still the fact that I was 
some how now in a better position helped me  tre m
endously and and I was s
till felt sorry that for 
my other fr iends that  they having no skill and ha
vi ng nothing to offe r in this respect were not 

able to alleviate their situation some how, and uh so
 I I I worked with this ma n for a certain while 
and again then some thing changed uh because be
cause uh uh uh they wanted to have  welders in 
in in in the camp directly.  There was a 
welder kommando and the Buna was constantly 
expanding and at the beginning when I came, the 
total of was approxima tely two thousand or 
two thousand five hundred.  Then we we we grew 
to approxima tely ten thousand.  What they did 
was also that uh they uh and the Germans were
...the Nazis did things which are not well known 
but should be should be recorded. 
 At a certain time, they estab
lished brothels for the German uh 
inma tes and the Polish inma tes, and they brought 
prostitutes from Poland and from Ger many into 
a special barrack where the the the Polish uh uh 
inma tes, non-Jewish Polish inma tes, or the 
German inmates had an opportunity
 to go whenever there was...there was a certain schedule for 
that.  There was a special barrack built in the mi
ddle of the ______ and we were called to uh to 

do the heat ing there, to establish the heating so
 they needed welders and I was  one of them 
which gave me  a tre mendous uh uh...which was a tremendous help.  Number one, I mean I was 

suffering from certain  _______, from from s wolle
n feet, so I didn't have to walk these long 
distances to the to the to the 
factory and uh also I became acqua
inted with the with the people 
there in the camp, ___ people and so and I started 
to do certain things in my free time , using 
scrap and ma king hooks for the beds, or or for the 
curtains and things li
ke that and I...and it 
turned...there was no mo ney.  I mean none of us 
was allowed to have any money certainly, so 
you were bartering for bread and and and so th
is kind of work uh uh uh...I wouldn't say I liked 
but it was helpful also to to come back to my 
to my somehow to my health and to my to my 
energy.  Uh also uh in in...in between 
I started to work outside in in 
that area with a with a with a 
ma n who wa s, interesting enough, a Polish national 
but who was an artist as a welder and I 
learned a lot from hi m, a nd...though he was a very 
nationalistic Pole, he was no anti-Se mite.  He 
was special, and we got on good terms.  Uh he
 bought me  pa pers, newspapers, I mean _______ 
and once in a while a piece of of 
of of uh sausage.  I even could could ask him to write for me  a 
letter to a neighbor of mi ne in Berlin with wh
om I had left some  money and some  things, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
43 
 
sure enough this lady, a wonderful 
lady, wrote back and and sent money and some  food to this 
Polish man, so I left hi m with the money because I couldn't use the money.  It was too dangerous 
but he gave me  the food and th
at was ma nna for me .  So uh uh
 and also this...____ _____ was his 
name ...he ha d a very interesting 
technique.  Since he 
hated the Germans s o much, uh and hated 
certainly to work for ____ for the war effort, he
 had developed a certain
 technique, you know, 
when you weld pipes you have to be very ca
reful because uh under high pr essure they could 
burst easily and therefore you have to be have to
 be very accurate.  I 
knew how to do this.  I 
knew how to do it, and then he taught me  how to
 do it that it looked good from the outside, was 
bad from the inside, by, for instance, apply 
more oxygen or an abundance of oxygen so that 
bubbles would would would would build inside 
the the the metal and it would...the we ld of 

me tal, and certainly the pressure...and the pipes 
would not be able to to to to tolerate the 
pressure.  Uh and that's how...I say when I worked
 with him for the first time, we established a 

contact.  Then I I worked in the camp for the...pa
rtly to establish that 
brothel and then when I 
was working in the camp, I heard one day that 
there were British pris
oners of war who had 
appeared in that factor y and sure enough, uh 
what the Germans had done was uh the British, as 
you know fr om the records, had fought Rommel in
 North Africa, had surrendered at _____.  The 
soldiers who had been taken prisoner in _____ had 
been brought to Italy and when Italy got out 
of the war, the Germans didn't let them go but
 transferred them to Germa ny and to Upper 
Salasia.  _______ was that camp, a tremendous pr
isoner of war camp and against the rules and 
regulations of the Geneva Convention, they 
brought _______ of these prisoners of war to 
Auschwitz, not to work like us, I me an like inma tes,
 but in their uniform. 
 Uh they had a special 
camp, a special prisoner of war camp and they
 were guarded by Germa n...by German soldiers, 
by by by by by army soldiers, but they put them to 
work in that factory and when I heard this I 
said I have to come ...I have to meet them.  Ho
w I didn't know, so I uh arranged it some how that I 
got an assignme nt with the same  kommando I 
was before, this _______...(pause) and uh when I 
saw the the the...they also when they got into
 the...under the uh uh area of their  ____ complex, 
they were ma rching, but they were ma rching differe
ntly than we were.  They were ma rching to 
such extent  that the German guards were mostly
 elderly fellows and they could hardly uh keep 
up with them, and whe n they saw us, I tell you they
 were throwing cigarettes at us and whatever 
they had and uh keep up these good spirits and 
so it was tremendous.  And uh I could almost 
weep when I when I saw that.  That was a tremendous...treme ndous uh...give us a 

spirit...treme ndous spiritual uplift, 
and I could feel it and then I 
I thought how could I come  into 
contact and luckily when I was tr
ansferred back to that fellow
  ____, uh British uh prisoners of 
war were working in the neighborhood and under 
very, very careful circumstances and all 
because they had to be careful.  Uh uh I was then
 able to establish cont ac
t with them, and luckily 
my school English was good enough..._____ English wh
ich I had improved during my  my years 
at the Univer sity.  The British were very carefu
l, on an individual basis,
 because they never knew 
with whom they were me eting, you know, and slowly but surely, and I say it with pride, I was 
able to to establish a very cl
ose personal contact and the mo me
nt the this kind of sound barrier 
was was was pierced, they became the best friend
s you could imagine, and what they did was not

only for me  but ma ny others, for instance, they
 had, you know, there was a different categories 
of of soup for the luncheon and uh the quality of
 our soup was the worst.  The quality for the 
German civilians was the best.  For the English pr
isoners of war, theirs was in between, but they 
didn't need it.  They didn't  want it because luckily
 they had thei r Interna
tional Red Cross parcels, 
so, therefore, they had already clients amongst ou
r people, our inma tes, to give them the soup 
which was very helpful because it was of bette
r quality and uh they uh...since I was on such 
terms with them, they helped me with chocolates
 and and things like that
.  At the end actually I 
had British...when I walked out from Auschwitz, I ha
d British socks.  I had British shoes.  I had 
British underwear, so uh uh because they had enough 
of that st uff and they didn't need all this, 
but what was most i mportant was...or two thi
ngs I ____ the Br itish ____ was, one day uh uh they 
told us that would...you know, they they they they 
had chocolate and cigarettes.  They were also 
trading with the civil population in 
that in that in that area, in th
at complex, uh so they they were 
able to construct a radio set via uh like in 
what...Stalag 18 (ph), you 
know...and they every night 
were listening to BBC London.  They had certain
ly technically tech...pe
ople with technical 
knowledge and so on, uh so...hiding it certainly fro
m different German guards and after I had 
established this uh atmosphere of
 confidence with them, uh they uh agreed to tell me what they 
have heard, so that I actually was able to 
uh to uh to follow the news of BBC Londo n in 
Auschwitz and compare this news with what 
was written in the news
papers...discuss it with 
them.  Also they asked me ...once in a while, you 
know, they me t girls, Ukrainian girls, Polish 
girls. They said they fell in love with them, 
or girls from Czechoslovakia, and they wanted to 
communicate with them but the girls certainly
 didn't  understand understand English, so I 
volunteered to write in Ge rman to these girls. 
 After the war, when it's over, we'll come  and 
ma rry you and I give you my word as a prisoner of
 the of the of the Eng
lish uh soldier that I will 
never forget you and so so that was that was th
at was uh uh with them and and I must say this 
this helped uh tremendously, because it it kept us
...at least kept me...I couldn't  communi cate with 
everybody in the camp but with the 
close circle of friends I had, 
what we had heard and what 
what what the progress were and one one of th
e most was...emotional days was when first uh 
there came the news...you must reme mber that by e
rror a girl had played around with a telegraph 
in London and the the ne ws had gone out that th
e Allies had landed in Normandy, and then it 
turned out it was a hoax, but on the day when they did land, uh some how there was an 

electrifying atmosphere in Auschwitz and the 
Germans became very nervous, and I immediately 
went to my friends and said what what uh happe
ned.  They said we don't know because we don't 

like to talk about it before we have a conf
irma tion, and the next morning uh uh they were 
jubilant and almost drunken, so sa
id it happened.  They have lande
d, and then I could come  back 
to my friends in the camp and said
 listen, that's  it, and it's crea
ted...I mean then we some how we 
we knew that it was si mp ly a matter of time when when when the the fr ont in the east and in the 

west would come  clear and though we were more or
 less aware that the Na
zis mi ght not allow us 
to live to to to experience the da
y of liberation, that at least that 
that there's some hope.  And that 
that we can look forward to that mo ment eventual
ly, so uh as I say, the the role of the of the 
British pr isoner...I I I'm very very grateful to th
em and I must say for for for for most of my

friends.  Uh years ago, BBC London brought me  over to uh to London, because they ha d a show, 
"This is Your Life," of one of the prisoners 
who interesting enough had been a me mb er of the 
British army, had survived Dunkirk, had had been 
had been ha d been taken prisoner at Dunkirk, 

had been I don't know in how
 ma ny prisoner of war camps, 
had tried to to escape and 
unfortunately could never ma ke it, and he was 
a daredevil.  He  was some  kind of a _____ and uh 
so uh uh uh they they they uh uh he had the courage to smuggle hims elf into our camp to find out 
what it was or what _____ was, because when I 
talked to these people,
 and I said listen, uh you 
I'm sure will survive.   I,
 I don't know, because we don't know.
..but I want to give you all the 
facts and when you come  back to Engl and and come  back to your fa milies, tell them our tale 
because I'm not...I cannot be sure, and they very 
often said to me , Norbert, how is it...how can 
this be possible.  I mean what you are telling us 
is so impossible.  Uh uh there the Gerries (ph) 
are going around, even these gangsters in SS uni
form, and you know, we had also cont...SS 
control in the in the 
camp...in in the area, _____, 
but they look like human beings would with 
with their noses and their eyes and their mouths ar
e the same  like others.  How is this possible?  
And uh uh (coughing) I said I have no explanation, but
 this is what it is an
d especially when in 
the summer of 1944 whe n the Hungarian transpor
ts came en ma sse...that's a transport uh with 
which, for instance, also _____ came  from _____ to
 Auschwitz, to our camp...the gas chambers 
worked over time, but the crematorias were not 
able to uh to uh to uh to uh do their work 
anymore, so hundreds and thousands of corpses we re burned outside of the crematoria so the 
area of Auschwitz was filled with th
e...call it st ench of of
 of burned flesh and uh then when this 
also waved into our area, I went around and I said to ____, you know, this must be it because we 

were aware _____, and uh uh uh in in...luckily, y
ou know, under...amongst these British who had 
no nobody who had any sympathy for Hitler or his 
racial ____.  They were really wonderful 
friends with with with with uh w
ith a sense of solidarity and as
 I told you, when I came  to that 
BBC show, this ma n, _______ was his name , they said 
this is your life and 
they brought me  over 
as one of the of the witnesses to to give ev
idence what...what he had done and how he done it 
and and uh uh to repeat this agai
n, I hope that this story of th
e British prisoners of war in 
Auschwitz will be told one day, becaus
e it deserves to be told.  Uh... 
 
Question:  Di d you...uh could you tell us about 
the...your birthday in
 1943 with the ____? 
 

Answer:  Oh that was...that wa
s that was still at a very bad 
 time.  Uh uh you know, it was...my 
birthday was on a Sunday and uh I turned thirty on
 that day, on April 26th, 1943.  I had been in 

Auschwitz uh six weeks and uh I was uh uh run down 
but not not completely desperate but not in 
good mood and uh especially on that day, on that 
birthday, it was a Sunday.  We  didn't ma rch out 
to work uh so it was a beautiful day and uh Auschwitz was not far from the ____ Mountains, 

beautiful area in Poland, and the air was so cl
ear, blue sky...you could see the mountains and 
their beauty, and some how that affected me  a
nd uh uh uh gave me  gave me some  courage and 
then on that day for one reason or the other, 
uh we got bread and some  ma r malade, which was 
not given too often and uh when 
one of my friends from the youth move ment said you see, on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0257  
46 
 
that birthday...it's almost better than cake _____ a
nd that that that happeni
ng somehow, that that 
was really a...you see, you you are...eve
ry little bit was was was helpfu
l in order to to to uh to to 
uh strengthen your your spirit of...your spirit 
of ______...your your...yeah...your
 spirit to live.  
Uh also uh I must say in this re
spect, another experience is intere
sting.  Uh we had in our block 
amongst the old timers a ma n who originated from
 Vienna.  He was uh uh a ___ scholar, and he 
was taken with a so-called Polis
h...Polish action in September '39, uh was taken to Buchenwald, 
fr om Buchenwald to to Auschwitz where I met 
him, and he was one of those who uh knew the 
bible and _____ and so very well, but, you know, you had no no books there.  Whatever was 
done there, were taught or disc
ussed was was from from your  me
mory, and he established a a 
service on the block so uh thought
 I was not...I mean certainly I 
attended service 
in Berlin, not 
every day but certainly on holy days and so so
 then under certain pr ecautions, under pr ecautions 
uh uh he assembled in the corner to have a mi nion (ph), to have ten people and he said the 

morning prayers and he knew them by heart cer
tainly and uh, you know, this is...this was an 
expression of directly resistance,
 that in...you know, God was treating us
 as he did treat us as we 
thought, _____ had forsaken us as we thought,but nevertheless we said, ____________, we still 
believe in you, and we came together for serviceand it was, I must say, I had the experience of 
unforgettable uh uh service.  We  had Yom Kippur se
rvice in in in Auschwitz with a few of our 
people uh and uh uh there was a cantor who also r
ecited all the prayer s 
from me mory a nd we 
said our prayers.  Certainly we were very ve
ry careful that the SS or
 ______ would not discover 
us, and in spite of, you know, in other words pr
aising God in spite of everything, and uh I must 

say uh  it it was strengthening us
 spiritually which was also very important only...after all, you 
don't exist only physically.  You 
also exist spir
itually and one can be uh uh uh the function of 
another, uh so uh uh this this...all 
this added to the to the coming 
back of energy I would say, that 
I wasn't ...after one year, let us say, I wasn't  used
 to Auschwitz.  I still was despising...but I had 
become somehow numb.  I knew I couldn't change th
ings...all these people I have lost, all these 
victims I had seen, all these corpses I had seen
 lying around, and by the way I lost also then 
within a shor t time , two of my close friends 
be...because they they could...one was a ma n who 
was highly idealistic and he couldn't take the mi sery
 and the the this this this this height of 
inhumanity, so he he uh said e
nough is enough.  Didn't take his life,
 but he just resigned.  And 
another friend of mi ne contracted
 jaundice and there was there was no 
no way to help him, so as 
I say I lost but I al so were able to establish 
contact with other people who had come...from all 
over the world people had come  to Auschwitz.  
I had met people from from from ____ with 
whom I communicated in my broken French, and a
nd tried to help them somehow.  There were 
people comi ng from all over, not only Poland an
d Yugoslavia but also Holland and Norway and 
and and uh France and and Germany and uh then afte
r a certain while, because they knew that I 
had this call it information service and had contac
ts with the British, that uh they came to me 
once in a while, tried to help.  For instance, one 
day a ma n ca me to me  whom I me t in the in the 
barrack of a friend of mi ne.  He was the elderly 
of this block, an old time r, still alive, now 
residing in Los Angeles, and uh he came  and he
 s a id he was looking for me , so uh what do you 
want, and he said he just came from a from a br
anch camp, from a from a mi ne, from a coal mi ne

camp.  Uh Max ____ was his name , and he said I n
eed you.  I said what do you need me  for.  He 
said I know that you have special co
ntacts with the British.  Try to 
help me .  I said why.  And he 
told me  the following story, that he uh uh originated from the German-speaking part of 
Czechoslovakia, uh ________.  He was a gynecologi
st, practicing doctor, but also was active 
politically against the Nazis and when they took
 over Czechoslovakia, it was time for him to to 
flee, and he was able to reach England and wh
en the war broke out, he volunteered as a doctor 
for the for the for the military.  They didn't take hi m into the ar my for one reason or the other, 

but they gave him a position as a doctor on th
e merchant ma rine and here was was...got a 
position wi th the...I think it was the Blue
 ____ Line in in in Manchester, in 

Liverpool...sorry...Liverpool.  From 
Liverpool uh ships at this time we
nt to still to the Far East, 
so he made a first journey from Liverpool to
 Singapore and came back and it was absolutely 
uneventful, but when he went on a second tr
ip, he came to Singapore and when he left 
Singapore, his boat was attacked by a German ra
ider which had come  from Japan, and that 
German raider was arme d and had already _____ some other ships, so it attacked his ship, was 
overwhelmed because they were not were not pr
operly arme d and was also taken into ____ and 
and they ma de their way...I think it was in th
e St rait of ______ where they were attacked, ma de 
the whole trip through the Indian Ocean, around the 
Cape of Good Hope into
 the Atlantic Ocean 
and landed in Bordeaux (ph) and were  not interf
er ed with by the by the by the by the Allied uh 
ships or the Allied Allied Allied ai
r force.  There was a time when when when England was very 
very weak but...when they came to to Bordeaux, he 
together with the crew was taken to a to a uh 
camp for the me rchant marine, but when they searched
 the uh safe of the sh
ip, of the British ship, 
they found out that he was not a British nationa
list but a Czech.  Why the British were so stupid 
to to to to mention that in this I don't know, but 
they did it.  And they then investigated in ____ 
who he was and found out that he was active agains
t the Nazis, so very soon after he landed in 
this me rchant ma rine camp, he got an order 
signed by _____ personally to be transferred to 
Auschwitz, and he came to Auschwit
z in the uniform of the British me rchant ma rine, and he was 
looking some how to bring his me ssage out.  When  he was in the coal mi ne he couldn't find 
anybody, but when he came  to Buna he heard abou
t me  (coughing) and uh I said what can I do.  
He said try...he said I know, and we infor med 
of t hat, that amongst these British pr isoners of 
war, there is a system that every mo nth or
 every second month, every third month, one of 
them...it's like a military action, has to try to esca
pe to ma ke his way into Switzerland, and there 
he is bringing news and info
r mation about about the life....
