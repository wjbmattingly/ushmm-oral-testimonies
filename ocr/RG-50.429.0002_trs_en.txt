Q: I would like you to begin be telling me
 your name , date of birth, and where you 
wereborn.    
 

A: My name  is John Woodruff.  My date of birth is July the 5
th
, 1915.  And I was 
born in a small town about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh.  The name  of this town is 

Connellsville. , Pennsylvania.  It™s spelled 
c-o-n-n-e-l-l-s-v-i-l-
l-e.  It™s just a 
small town right, right in the mountains
, about 30, about 32 miles from, from 
Morgantown, We st Virginia.  That™s where I was born. 
 

Q: Tell me  a little bit about what 
it was like growing up, your family. 
 

A: Well, I grew up in a uh well it was a 
poor fa mily.  We  didn™t have too mu ch you 
see.  And of course there was a lot of 
me mbers of my fa mily.  My, my mother 
birthed twelve children.  I wa
s the eleventh child.  Well the, it was eight gi rls and 

there was four boys.  Now all the girls grew
 up to be adults except one that which 
was the twelfth child and she, and she died in infancy.  Two of my brothers died 

in infa, two of my older brothers. And 
one brother got killed hunting when he was 
sixteen years of age.  And that™s how, that
™s, that™s how my fa mily, fa mily was set 
up.  Cause my mother ma rried when she was nineteen and my father was twenty-
two.  They had this large fa mily which was too many children, too ma ny c hildren.  
But they ma de it. 
 

Q: What do you reme mber about your family life and how you lived and what you 
did and in general? 
 

A: Well uh of course my fat her was a la
borer.  He dug coal. 
 He carried hod on, on 
construction work.  He worked in the c
oke ovens there in, in uh, in my home  
town.  And that™s how he ma de his livi
ng.  Cause my mother she did days work 
for some of the families there in, in the 
area in which we, where we were living.  
And that™s how, that™s how we survived.  As I said before, we didn™t have too 

much, but we ma naged to ma ke it under the circumstances. 
 

Q: Do you have good me mo ries of your chil
dhood, of some  of the values that were 
installed in you? 
 

A: Well you see my, both of my parents th
ey weren™t, they weren™t very well 
educated you see.  In fact my father we
nt, I think he went to about the eighth 
grade and my mother went to about four
th grade.  And uh 
they didn™t put too 
much stress.  There was no, was never at 
any time that my parents would sit down 

 
 
2

2
and discuss education.  Because they di
dn™t have much educ ation themselves.  
And the only thing that they were con
cerned about was me  going to school uh 
keeping up my attendance in school to k
eep the truant officer from bothering 
them.  That was, that, that was, that wa
s their extent as, as far as my educ ation 
was concerned. 
 
Q: But you went forward with it.  You were interested. 

 

A: Yes, well, of course, comi ng along, comi ng 
along in the early grades and well, of 
course, I, I used to play truant ever, once 
in a while, to, to go to the movies with a 
friend of mi ne.  And uh but we never, you 
know, we never got into any real, real 
trouble, you know, uh per se.  and, of course
, I continued to um, not to get ahead 

of my story, I quit school when I was sixt
een.  See back there, you know, the kids 
when they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to 

work in the factory.  There was a couple 
of factories.  There was a box factory 
and there was a glass factory.  We ll I quit 
when I was sixteen, but I couldn™t get a 
job because they discrimi nated against blacks
 in the, in the, in those industries.  
So I, I, I sat around for a while.  I guess 
about a year.  And I decided well I better 
go on back to school.  So I went back to 
school, starting in, in my freshman year.  

And then I tried to join the Navy.  Well th
e Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks.  
And the quota was filled.  And,of course I wasn™t interest
ed in the Army at that 
particular time because I had a couple brot her-in-laws who, who was, who had 

gone into the Army and, of course, they™d 
told me some  stories that was, wasn™t 
too pleasant.  So I didn™t have any inte
rest in the Ar my.  So I continued on, 
continued on in school.  I completed my 
freshma n year and my sophomore year, 
and then I we nt into the city school, cause
 my fre shman and s ophomore year, they 
didn™t have any athletics in 
the school at all, which  I 
could participate in.  So I 
went into the city school in my junior 
year, and I went out for football.  Well I 
stayed out for football up until a week before the fi rst game, and my mother made 

me quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to 

take care of my chores around the house. 
 So the, the line coach of the football 
was, was a track coach of the school and he
 noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of 

speed when he had us running wind sprint
s up and down the field in our football 
uniform.  So he asked me to come  out fo
r track.  So that™s how I got started in 
track.  And, of course, I, I started pr
ogressing quite well in, in uh my track 
activities and he told me  don™t, don™t 
go back, go out for football anymore, 

because he was afraid I mi ght get hurt.  
So that™s how I started my track ca reer. 
 

Q: Prior to that had you been
 real active in sports in 
your other schools 
or at home ? 
 

A: Well, when you, I was active like on, on 
like we played a little sandlot, sandlot 
baseball uh and uh softball, t
hose type of sports.  I nev, 
I was never interested in 
basketball.  I tried, tried it but I neve
r, never could uh never become  real 
interested in basketball at 
all see.  But softball and 
uh baseball was the thing, was 
the two sports that  I was quite interest ed in.

Q: You me ntioned a little b
it about certain doors that were
 closed to you as a black 
person.  Did you face a lot of racism in Pennsylva nia?   We re you aware of it? 
 
A: Well there was some , it was some , t her
e was some  around that area see cause I 
grew up in a, in, in a, in an, in an 
environment where there™ s all whites.  Ther e 
was only two black fami lies, my fa mily and another family.  All my playma tes, 

all my schoolma tes were white kids.  So I 
didn™t, well of course there was, there 
was, it was time s when u h we™d, we™d get 
into fi ghts with some
 of maybe one of 
the kids ma ybe called me  nigger.  And, of 
course, naturally, that, that was, that 
was a fighting word see.  So we™d fight.  
Next day we™re friends
 again.  That™s the 
way it was. 
 

Q: So you were used to that banter.  
We re there other experiences, personal 
experiences that were difficult for you 
as a black person?   At that time. 
 

A: Well there was, there wa s, there wa
s some, there was some, there was some 
difficulty in terms like in 
trying to get little jobs 
around that area see.  They 
discrimi nated against, against the blacks. 
 But that was, that was about all, you 
see.  That wa s about all. 
 

Q: Now you got active in sports and trac
k.  Did you experience racism in sports? 
 

A: No.  No.  Not at all.  Not at a
ll.  My high school coach who, who uh who uh 
coached me  in track was a very fine ma n.  His name  is Joseph Lourou.  He was a 

wonderful ma n and he was a wonderful co
ach.  And he taught me  a number of 
things that I did, that I wa sn™t taught
 at home, you know, about how to conduct 
myself.  Of course I was doing a little sm
oking at the time.  He told me to give 
that up, which I did.  And he said if I,
 if I continued doing well in my track 
activities I had a chance to go to college. 
 We ll that was just unheard of in my 
fa mily of going to college , you see.  
Because no, no, no me mber of my fa mily 
finished high school.  So I dropped all my 
little habits that I had that was, that 

would, would be detrime ntal to me  a c hieving my goal or my goals.  And I ended 

up getting a scholarship to the University
 of Pittsburgh after I was graduated in 

1935. 
 

Q: How i mportant were sports to you?  And why?  

 

A: Well it was, well, of course, at that pa
rticular time, it was very important to me 
because it enabled me. 
 

Q: I need you to say that again, at that
 time  sports were important to me . 
 

A: Well at that time sports were important
 to me  and particularly the, the track 
activity type of sports, because that enab
led me  to get a scholarshi p to college.  
And that was the only wa y that I could go 
to college was thro
ugh athletics.  My 
parents didn™t have the mone
y to send me  to school.  
I fact I didn™t even have 

 
 
4

4
when I,  when I received the scholarship 
at the University of
 Pittsburgh.  I didn™t 
even have transportation to get to school
.  And the sheriff of my home  town had 
his chauffeur to drive me to school.  That™s
 how I got to school in the, in the fall 
of ™35.  And money, I had exactly twenty-five cents in my pockets when I entered 
the University of Pittsburgh.  That™s all th
e mone y I had.  Cause as I said earlier I 
came from a poor fa mily. 
 

Q: So you saw sports not just for the joy of 
being an athlete but as a, a way to help 
you further yourself. 
 

A: That™s right.  Correct.  And of course 
when I got the scholarship, and I, when I 
went to the University of Pittsburgh, cause I 
told all, all my fr iends at  home, I said 
if I don™t make it, I™m not comi ng back to C
onnellsville.  But I made it.  I made it.  
I worked hard and I ma de it. 
 

Q: How good were you as a track? 

 

A: Well course I was the best, I was the be
st in high school.  And of course when I 
went to Pitt I was able to beat all the at
hletes, all the athletes
 that was on the track 
team on my that ran in my race at Pitt 
in my freshman year.  I came along very, 
very fast.  My junior year in, in high sc
hool, of course my races were quite slow, 
but they showed progress.  But then my se
nior year, I, I just bloomed.  I just came 
into my own.  Uh I, my uh
 main event was the mile.  That was, that was the one 
the event that my coach had me concentrate on see.  Well the first mile that  I ran 

in high school, my junior year in high
 school was four mi nutes and forty-four 
seconds.  In my senior year I ran four tw
enty-three four.  I came  along that fast.  
And of course when I ran that race I,
 I ran the second fastest school boy, school 
boy mile in the country, four twenty-thr
ee four.  Al, Al Zampe r ine who was on 
the Olympic team with me , he ran four twenty-one some thing.  But when I won 

my race in my round, my mile, when I 
won my  mile race, I won it about a 
hundred and twenty yards ahead of th
e ma n who was uh ran second to me .  
Course if I had some body to push 
me, it would have been faster. 
 

Q: So you were pretty good.  We re 
you thinking in terms of Olympics? 
 

A: No.  No.  When I completed my freshman
 year at Pitt, that summer I had intended  
to go on home and take it easy for the summ
er.  But my coach asked me to try out 
for the Olympic team.  Course I had no idea 
that he wanted me  to do that, you see.  
So I said okay, we™ll try out for it.  So
 I tried out for it.  I qualified in the 
preliminaries which they ran at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh.  I qualified in the 
semi -finals which they ran at Harvard Stadium winning the event in the, in the, in 

the half a mile.  And then at Randall™s Isla
nd where they ran the finals, I, I, I won 
my event there and I went to Be
rlin, Germany, a nd won my event. 
 

Q: We™ll get to that in a mi nute.  But th
at™s.  So you had no thoughts about being an 
Olympic star? 

 
 
5

5
 
A: None whatsoever.  In fact I never ev
en thought in terms of, of, of going to the 
Olympics.  Never thought in terms of that
 at all.  And it was the coach that uh 
approached me  on that and said he wa nted me  to try out for the team. 
 

Q: So this was necessarily 
a dream of yours or anything 
 

A: No.  Not at all. 

 

Q: When you were at the University of P
ittsburgh, di d racism enter into your school 
life at all there? 
 

A: At the University of Pitt
sburgh?   Yes there was, ther
e was a, an incident where 
race uh entered.  I, when I came back from the Olympic game s, the professor of 

my English Departme nt didn™t want to let, 
di dn™t want to let me enter it, enter the 
program cause I was a month late.  However, I think the chancellor must have 

interceded and ma de it, ma de arrangeme nts 
for me to get into the, get into the 
English program.  And, of course, another 
thing that hurt me  quite badly when I 
was grad, when I was being graduated from
 the University.  They had what was 
known as the U, the University of Pittsburgh Hall of Fa me .  Well, I was the only 

athlete to bring the school international re
cognition, but they di
d not, they did not 
uh select me  for the Hall of Fa me . 
 

Q: And you think that™s because you were black? 

 

A: I don™t know what it was.  But I, I, I, 
I can only, I can only assume  that.  Because 
now they had, they had all American f
ootball players that brought the school 
national prestige, national recognitio
n.  I brought the school international 
recognition.  They ma de the Hall of Fa me , 
but I didn™t.  They were white and, of 
course, I, I was black.  So
 what, the only, only, I can only assume  it was because 
of race. 
 

Q: What about in your socializing and the fr
iends you ma de in college?   Was race an 
issue? 
 

A: No.  But of course I socialized only with my own kind, you know, my own race of 
people see.  I didn™t socia
lize with anybody else other th
an my  own race of people 
during the, the four years that I uh was goi
ng to the Uni, going to the University 
of Pittsburgh. 
 

Q: And on the, and in athletics it was a non-issue? 

 

A: I had no problem as, as, as a, as a, as a at
hlete  at all because we were all, we were 
all on the same tea m.  We were all very, 
very close.  In fact the athletes 
participat ed with me even after we left
 the University, we, we were very, very 

close.  I know it, it uh in 
athletics you know you become , 
it™s, you become, it, it™s 

 
 
6

6
stronger than a fraternity when you™re
 working with, when you™re running 
together, training together, trying, trying to
 reach certain goals in, in your, in your 
sport, you become  very, very close.  And I 
still, and I still have contact with some  
of the, some  of the fellows that ran on the team with me  even today. 
 
Q: So in sports the raci
al lines just fade away. 

 

A: That™s right.  That™s right. 

 

Q: But in everyday life you were 
still confronti
ng some  of it. 
 

A: Oh yes.  You were always remi nded of the fact that, you know, you were, you 
were, you™re colored, you know, and that 
you there was certain, 
certain things you 
couldn™t do and certain things you co
uld do as a result of your race. 
 

Q: Sports was an equalizer I guess. 

 

A: That™s right.  And I think sports has done
 so much in order to make uh the country 
a better country in terms of, of, of so
cial relationships be
tween peoples.  And 
that™s what the Olympics does, you know.  You be, you become  very, you become  

acquainted with a lo
t of people in particularly people on your team and, and you 
become  very close with, to them.  And you don™t think in terms of race when 

you™re dealing with them see.  And they 
don™t think in terms of race uh with you.  
I know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgi
a, to Athens, Georgia, and I made 
contact with uh an athlete 
that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the 
1936 Olympic team.  Uh Speck Towns.  We ll now he was, he was a, he was a 
coach at the University of Georgia.  And 
of course back in that time  you know the 
South was running rampant with, with uh 
racism and discrimi nation.  So I™m 
when I got into Athens, I call him up.  And he took and he told me , asked me  
where I was, where I was stopping.  And I 
told him.  He said no you stay right 
there and I™ll come  down and get you and bring you out to the school.  And that™s 

what he did.  That was in 1950, 19 when, 
when the racism and discrimi nation was 
running rampant in (words mi ssing in origin
al transcript). But that shows you the, 

the closeness you have with, with
 your fellow athletes you see. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you before we sort of talk more about the Olympics, that of course as 
you know is our focus.  When you were at the University of Pittsburgh, were you 

uh aware of anti-Semitism?  
 

A: No.  No.  I wasn™t aware of any, 
of any anti-Semitism while I was at the 
University. 
 

Q: How much did you know about wh
at was happening in Germany?  
 

A: No more than what was adver, no more 
than what was advertised in the, in the 
papers, you know.  Uh we heard a lot about 
what Hitler, what 
Hitler was doing as 

 
 
7

7
far as the, the Jewish people were 
concerned.  And you know just before the 
Olympics, you know he™s written a book Mein 
Kamp f.  I didn™t, I didn™t read it.  
Uh the book that I did read was the Rise 
and Fall of the Third Reich.  I read, I 
read that some  years later.  But when we went, cause when we went to the 
Olympics, we weren™t interested, we weren™
t interested in politics.  We  were only 

interested in going to Germany, participat
ing in our events, and trying to win as 
ma ny gold me dals or medal as we could wi
n, see, and come  home .  That was the, 
that was our interest.  Cause see I was, 
I made the team when I was twenty.  Uh 
and before I got to Berlin, Germany, I ,
 I had a birthday and I was twenty-one 
when I actually won my gold me dal.  So we were young.  All of us were young. 
 

Q: So you didn™t know too terribly much a
bout the situation in Ge rmany or that 
Hitler wasn™t particul arly
 fond of bl acks either. 
 

A: No.  No.  Not at all. 
 I know uh there was, ther
e was one in, there was one 
instance when we had a young German athlet
e come  visit with us.  And we were 
asking him, we were asking this young at
hlete, he spoke English fluently.  And 

we asked him uh what did the peep, what 
did the German people think of Hitler.  
Well they thought he was, they thought he 
was a great ma n.  First of all his reason 
for ma king that statement was the fact 
that the economi c situation had improved 
tremendously under his regime , you see.  Becau
se what he did, he withdrew from 
the League of Nations, as you know, star
ted building up all this war arma me nt, 

opened up all these factories 
to build all these weapons, 
and it ma de it possible for 
a lot of Germans people to go to work.  And that™s why they thought that he, he 

was, he was great for the country.  Bu
t they didn™t realize that they had a 

Frankenstein on their hands, you see.  Because you know they attempted to 
assassinate him.  
 
Q: When you learned that you qualified 
to go to the Olympics, do you reme mber 
how you felt? 
 

A: Well I was very, I was very happy and very elated I was able to ma ke the team 
you see.  Course not realizing what the 
Olympic program wa s all about at that 
time because everyt hing came very fast to me, see.  But when I, when I, when I 

came, when my, when I came down t o earth
 and realized what I had accomplished 
by ma king the team, then I was most  elated. 
 

Q: You were representing the United 
States in a major international. 
 

A: United States.  That
™s right.  Um mmm. 
 

Q: That must have ma de you very proud. 

 

A: It did.  It ma de all my fa mily very proud.  And all my friends. 

 

Q: Had you ever traveled so far before? 

 
 
8

8
 
A: No.  the furtherest I ever, I, I never even
 traveled as far as Pittsburgh when I went 
to, went to the University and we, I stayed
 right, right there in that small town of 
Connellsville.  And the furtherest I was 
away from home  was  when I went to 
Pittsburgh to the University, which was 50, 51 miles away. 
 

Q: So tell me a little bit about your trip
 over.  What it you know what it was like. 
 

A: It was very interesting. 

 

Q: And actually I need you to being 
by saying the trip over was very nice. 
 

A: The trip over was very, very interest
ing.  Of course we sailed on the S.S. 
Manhattan which was one of the better lin
ers at that particular time.  And, of 
course, they had wonderful f
acilities for us while we tr
aveled by boat.  It took us 
eight days before we landed in Hamburg, 
Germa ny.  Now some  of us we re pretty 
good sailors and some of us weren™t.  Becau
se with ma ny, quite a, quite a, quite a 

number of the athletes got sick, seas
ick, cause the sea was pretty rough.  But 
fortunately for me  I was a pr
etty good sailor.  I didn™t ge
t sick.  So I was able to 
ma ke the trip and enjoy the food.  B
ecause once you get seasick you don™t want 
no parts of food.  But I was able to eat the 
food and enjoy it and enjoy the trip as a 

whole. 
 

Q: Were there traini ng facilities on board? 

 

A: Oh yes.  They ma de it possible, they, 
they equipped that ship whereby all the 
athlet es that were participating in the va
rious ac tivities to be able to trai n while 
the ship was sailing.  And of course with the, with the runners, you know, we did 

a lot of jogging on the port, port side of
 the ship, you see.  To keep, you know, try 
to keep in shape that way, see. 
 

Q: Now did you stick together with the 
runners primarily or did everybody get 
along?  
 

A: Yes, well most of the runners pretty mu
ch stayed, stuck together.  Now like the 
weight me n, those who threw the discus
 and the shot put and the hammer , we 
didn™t socialize too much with them.  But,
 of course, but the runners we all had, 
we had more in common with them. 
 

Q: Did you have a room ma te? 

 

A: I had a room mate, and my, my ro
om ma te uh in going over uh was uh, uh Mac 
Robinson, that was Jackie Robinson™s brothe
r.  And of course he also roomed 
with me  in, in the Olympic village. 
 

Q: Was there any separation of black
 and while athletes on the ship? 

 
 
9

9
 
A: No.  No.  

 

Q: So all of a sudden you™ve left por
t and there™s no segregation anymore. 
 

A: That™s right.  That™s right. 

 

Q: Can you say some thing to that effect? 

 

A: We ll that™s, that was the way it was, th
at was the way everything was set up for us 
you see.  And it was.  It was very good. 
 It shouldn™t have been any segregation 
because we were all a member of one t
eam, the American team.  We all had one 
objective and there was, there should not 
have any segregatio
n and there wasn™t 
any segregation. 
 

Q: But wasn™t this, this was a slightly diffe rent experience . 

 

A: Yes.  That™s true.  It wa
s a slightly different experien
ce.  But they, they, they had, 
there was no segregation. 
 

Q: So you were on this boat for eight days? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And I assume this was a pretty exciting time for you. 

 
A: It was exciting.  It was the first, firs
t time I™d ever taken, taken a boat anywhere.  
And, and a, and a, and above all, a luxury 
liner like that you see that was set up.  
Cause that was the S.S. Manhattan was one 
of the, one of our big liners.  It was 
the S.S. Manhattan and S.S. Wa shington. 
 The S.S. Wa shington brought the team, 
brought the team me mbe r s back.  But the 
S.S. Manhattan took us, took us abroad 
you see to Germany. 
 
Q: Were you pretty excited a
bout comp eting at that point? 
 

A: Oh yes.  Very excited.  And of course I 
wanted to win.  And that, that™s all, that 
was always my philosophy when I toed, when
 I toed the line on any race.  My one 
objective was to win.   In fact throughout
 my collegiate career I think I won about 

90, 90 percent of every race I ever ran. 
 

Q: That™s impr essive.  So the mood 
on the boat.  What was the mood like? 
 

A: Friendly.  Everybody was friendly. 
 Everybody had a good time .  Everybody 
enjoyed themselves.  Even those who got seasick.

Q: I want to hear about your arrival and 
everything, but I think 
we™re going to change 
tapes fi rst.

Q: I want to backtrack for a mi nute.  Th
ere was to my understanding at the time of, 
right prior to the ™36 Olympics, some  e
ffort to boycott the Olympics.  How aware 
were you of this? 
 

A: Not, no, I wasn™t aware of too much about
 it.  I heard a little 
bit about it.  The boy 
uh the boycott, there was some , there was 
some  talk about the Olympics being 
boycotted because of what Hitler wa s doi
ng to the Jewish people in Germany.  
But uh there was noth, nothing ma de, ma de 
too much of as far as the team 
me mbers were concerned cause it was 
never discussed amongst, amongst the 
team me mbers.  But we hear
d it and we heard some thing about it, but we never, 

we never discussed it.  As I said earlier
, we weren™t interest
ed in politics you see 
at all.  We were only interest
ed in going to Germa ny and winning. 
 

Q: I want to ask you to say that again. The reason I™m asking you is because I want 
you to do the whole thing again 
without as I said earlier. 
 

A: Oh,okay. 
 
Q: And tell me  a little bit was ther
e talk of boycotting the Olympics? 
 

A: There was some  talk.  There was some
 talk about boycotting the Olympics, but it 
wasn™t, it wasn™t some thing that was a,
 a, a matter of conversation amongst the 
team me mbers you see.  We 
didn™t, we didn™t uh go into
 any detail on it.  So uh 
we didn™t bother, we didn™t concern ourse
lves too much about it.  All we knew 
that we were we™d ma de the team, we  
were, we were on the boat, and we were 
going to Germany.  That ™s all.  That™s all we were interested in. 
 

Q: You weren™t interested in the politica l situation?  

 

A: No.  Not at all. 

 

Q: But prior to your going over
, were there articles in th
e newspapers, was there any 
conversation in the black community or 
in the black press about going or not 

going to the Olympics? 
 

 
 
11

11
A: No.  Not that I know of.  In fact I, I 
don™t, I don™t recall of
 ever reading anything 
uh in the, in the newspapers, the black 
press or the white pr
ess concerning going 
as, as far as the ma tter of going to the Olympics was concerned. 
 
Q: So there wasn™t much of a move me nt  in the States before you went? 

 

A: Not at all.  Not to my knowledge anyhow. 

 

Q: Now.  Back to the boat.  
You arrived in Hamburg, yes? 
 

A: Ha mburg, Germany.  That™s where the ship uh docked.  And then we took a train 
fr om there to Berlin. 
 

Q: What was the arri val in Hamburg like? 

 

A: It was, it was very, it was pret
ty exciting.  You know, the, the, the, 
 

Q: Can you start by saying, when we arrived? 

 

A: When we, when we arrived in Hamb ur
g, it was, it was pretty, pretty exciting 
event for us, you know.  It was a lot of 
people out there to, to welcome us to 
Germany at that particular time .  And 
then and of course we appreciated, we 
appreciated the welcome that they were, th
ey™re showing us at that time  you see. 
 

Q: Who were those people? 

 
A: German people.  German people.  They were out to welcome us, welcome the 
American team to uh, to uh, to Germany.  They knew, they knew where we were 
going to go.  And they, and they, they knew the reason why we were there. 
 

Q: Were they average citi
zens?   Wa s it organized? 
 

A: I don™t know whether it was organized or not
.  We just saw, we just saw a lot, lot 
of people you know, cheering us and what have you, when we, when we docked 

in, in Hamb urg. 
 

Q: Did they have flags, was there music? 

 

A: I don™t recall really.  I d
on™t recall.  All, all I saw wa
s a lot of people and a lot of 
waving of the hands and what have you, see. 
 

Q: You felt pretty good?   And th
en how did you get to Berlin?  
 

A: By train.  By train.  We  went to Berl
in by train.  After we docked in Hamburg uh  
they put us all on a train, all the Amer i
can team members on a train, and we went 
to Berlin to the Olympic village. 

 
 
12

12
 
Q: Were you welcomed there? 

 

A: We were welcomed at the Olympic v
illage and, of course, they assigned, they 
assigned us, assigned quarters for all of th
e team me mbers.  They had little huts 
that we, that we lived in, see.  And, of
 course, there was uh two, two me n or two 
athletes per, per hut.  And, of course, 
I roomed with uh Mac Robinson while we 
were, while we were in, in the Olympi
c village.  That was Jackie Robinson™s 
brother. 
 

Q: What was life like in the Olympic village? 

 

A: It was very pleasant.  Very, in, in the 
Olympic village it was very, very pleasant.  
The accommodations were very good.  Th
e food was very good.  And uh the, the 
cooks from t he S.S. Brahma n, that was the German™s uh luxury liner, those cooks 

were the cooked the food for the American team, and they did a fine job. 
 

Q: Were there activities, were, was there a 
lot of camaraderie amongst the athletes?   
Tell me a little bit about what it was like spendi ng time there. 
 

A: Well, there was a lot of camaraderie
 amongst the American team me mbe r s you 
see.  We  do, we, of course, we sociali
ze, you know, visiting one another, visiting 
each, each hut you know.  Talking about what we hoped to do at the, at the 

game s.  Tha t  sort of conversation.  Bu
t that was about it you see.  Cause you 

know there was nothing else you know 
that we could do you know under the 
circumstances because  there was a certain am
ount of discipline that was exercised 
to ma ke sure that uh that the team me mb
ers did what they were supposed to do in 

preparation for their activities, their 
athletic ac, at hletic activities. 
 

Q: A lot of training? 

 

A: Yes we trained.  They had training faci
lities there whereby we, we trained in 
preparation for, for our race you see.  A
nd, and they had a track there that we 
could that, that we could run on in, in orde
r to keep us, keep us in shape, cause 
you know I guess a, a lot of us got out 
of shape you know based on particularly 
those who got sick, you see, and they had 
to work pretty hard, had to get through 

their land legs back again see.
  So it, it was, they had, th
ey had to do quite a bit of 
training to ki nd of get themself together you know for their races you know. 
 

Q: Were the training facili
ties separated by nationality? 
 

A: No.  No.  

 

Q: So on the track there were. 

 

 
 
13

13
A: There were all, all, all nationalities who participated on the same track.  Cause 
they only had one, one facility for us, you see. 
 
Q: And you™d me ntioned that it was important
 to ma intain a discipline.  We re there 
rules that you reme mber ?   Certai
n things that you were told? 
 

A: Well uh they, they weren™t spelled out,
 you know, rule one, rule two, rule three, 
and rule four.  It was nothing like that. We  as athletes knew that we had a certain, 

certain responsibility to maintain ourselves 
to the best of our abilities so that we 
would be prepared for our, for our races,you see.  And we took that, we took that 

responsibility on our own, you see.  A
nd uh but we, we knew that was it was 
understood that that was how we ha
d to react or conduct ourselves. 
 

Q: Now I understand this Olympic village they
 created was really very, very pretty.  
Can you tell me a little bit more 
about what it looked like there? 
 

A: Looked like a, like a beautiful college 
campus.  Beautiful grass, laid out very, 
very well.  I, I took some  very nice pict
ures of that Olympic village which I have 
at home.  Uh because I had, I owned, I ha
d a little old box came ra and I took some  
pictures of the village.  But it was very, 
very nice.  A beautiful place.  It was a 
beautiful pl ace. 
 

Q: Did you notice any discrimi nation once you arrived in Germany? 

 

A: No.  I didn™t notice any.  After I. 
 No, I did not no, I did not notice any 
discrimi nation when I arrived in Germa
ny.  After I™d won my  race, won my gold 
me dal, I went downtown Berlin doing a 
little sightseeing of 
the city, and the 
people, the German people were very, ve
ry cordial.  They just crowded around 
you for autographs.  Very friendly.  Ther
e was nothing, I, I didn™t notice anything 
negative at all the w
hole time that I participated in those 1936 Olympic game s as 
fa r as we were concer ned.  Now you™ve probabl y heard some  stories about Hitler 
uh refusing to shake, shake Jesse Owen™s 
hand.  Well that™s, t
hose stories were 
wrong.  They were wrong.  One time  Hitler invi
ted some  of the athletes up in his, 
up in, up in his uh the sections that 
they had established for him and his 
lieutenants.  Uh Helen Stevens who w
on the hundred me ters for the women, the 
America for the, she was on the women™s 
team.  She and her coach were invited 
up that one particular time.  And of cour
se the, the American coaches spoke to 
Hitler about that.  And infor med hi m that
 if he wasn™t going to invite all the 
athletes up there then he, then they wa
nted him not to do that uh with any, any 
other athletes.  And at the time that he invited these athl etes up there, Je sse Owens 

was still competing on the track.  So ther
efore he could not ha
ve gone up there at 
that particular time. 
 

Q: So it was decided that he wasn™t going to shake anyone™s hand. 

 

 
 
14

14
A: That™s right.  The American, the American coaches told hi m not to do that 
because he was see if he was going to 
discrimi nate, and only have, only have 
certain athletes come  up there, then uh they, they, they, they uh they, they said 
they didn™t want him to do that. 
 

Q: So what was Hitler™s deci sion on this? 

 

A: Well he, he, he, he didn™t ha
ve no athletes come  up there for the rest of the game s. 
 

Q: Were you aware while you were over ther
e, you said you personally didn™t face 
any discrimi nation, but were you aware of anti-Semitism?  
 

A: No.  Not at all.  As I said he must have, he opened up, he mus t  have declared the 
moratorium for the game s because the thi
ngs that perhaps he had been doing prior 
to the game s, nothing like  that took pl
ace during the game s, you see.  And of 
course after the game s you know
 what happened, you see. 
 

Q: There were no traces?  
 Now did you and you spent time  leaving the Olympic 
village and the stadium a nd you just saw nothing? 
 

A: That™s right.  That™s, we 
didn™t see anything that was, th
at was out of line or that 
was negative. 
 

Q: Do you remember much about th
is Glickman-Stoller controversy? 
 

A: Yes, yes, we heard the story.  You s
ee Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were the 
two Jewish boys, extra boys that was, that 
was selected or qualified to run on the 
relay team.  That was the four by one hundred relay team.  Wh en we, I don™t 

know, none of us knew who ma de the decisi
on as to keep those fellows off that 
team.  Jesse Owens wanted to give up hi
s position on the team.  And I™ m sure that 
Ralph Metcalfe probably would have give
n his position up, to give Sam Stoller 

and Marty Glickman a chance to run, but
 the coaches of the American team 
decided they wanted Jesse and, and RalphMetcalfe  to run on that team.  And so 

they, so they didn™t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run.  And they still 

would have won the, they still would have
 won the race cause  they were both very 
fine, very fine runners, very 
fine sprinters.  But who ma
de the, who ma de the final 
decisi on?   Whether it was Lawrence R
obertson, whether Hitler had so mething, 
some thing to say about it, we don™t know
.  We  di scussed it many, ma ny times, but 

we never did know who ma de that deci
sion to keep those two fellows from 
running on that team.  And to this day, Ma
rty Glickman is very, very bitter about 
it, you see, cause I knew Mart
y Glickman very well see. 
 

Q: Do you remember how you and some of th
e other athletes felt when this took 
place? 
 

 
 
15

15
A: We felt, we felt that they, we felt that 
they should have been given the opportunity 
to participate, an opportunity to win 
a gold me dal and which they would have 
won a gold me dal.  The y still would have won that relay team, regardless whether 
Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe was on it or 
not.  They still would have won.  But 
they didn™t give those boys a chance.  A
nd that™s why Marty today, to this day, is 
very bitter about that, 
about that decision. 
 

Q: Describe what it was lik
e being at the game s whe n 
you weren™t running.  Uh the 
mood, the pageantry, did you 
see Hitler regularly? 
 

A: Well everything, we saw Hitler every day when he came out to the game s, but 
you see, he was so far away just like myse
lf, uh sitting in the, in the stand, he was 
too far away for us to even see, see the im
age of him, see.  We knew he was there.  
We knew each time he came into the game  because you know the German people 

you know, you know, naturally would create
 a commotion when he, when he 
entered the st adium, when he entered the 
stadium.  But me  personally, he was too 

far away from me  to ma ke out just, just 
what he looked like other than from, from 
those pictures that I™ve seen some , seen of him se e. 
 

Q: Try to paint for me  a picture of what it
 was like at the game s, what it felt like, 
what it looked like, because 
I didn™t have that option? 
 

A: Well at the game s, at those particular 
game s in 1936, they were a very fine set of 
game s.  Tha t  was my first experience you 
see.  That was my first experience of, 
of, of being in the Olympic game s.  It wa
s very, very exciting.  The events were 
run off with precision, the athletes didn™
t have to wait around when their event 
was called, the starter started, started 
your event.  You knew the Germans, you 
knew they™re, they™re a stick, they™re a stic
kler for things being done just right.  

And that™s the way they, that™s the wa y th
ey ran the game s.  Because in talking 
with some  of the old timers who had fo
llowed the Olympic games prior to the 
1936 game s that, that I participated in, they
 said they that the Berlin game s were 
the finest Olympic game s that they™d ever
 witnessed.  That was the, that was the 
statement they made. 
 

Q: Was there a lot of fanfare? 

 

A: There was a lot, there was a lot of fanfar
e.  There was a lot of fanfare.  A lot of 
excitement.  Lot of excitement. 
 

Q: Were there fl ags, parades, music.  I m
ean, I™ m trying to get, I™m trying to imagine 
what it was like being there. 
 

A: Well, the flags, the only flags that, th
at was, that took place wa s when after the 
athlete™s completed their event.  Now, when the American, when the Americans 

won, the American flags went up.  And of
 course, it was, if it was a foreign 
country that was part of, part of the r
ace, took third or second, whichever the case 

 
 
16

16
ma y be, or even first, their, the flags 
representing their nations went up.  Those 
are the only flags that were 
waving.  And of course in 
the, in the uh bleachers, 
some  of the, some  of the uh spectators were waving flags.  Some  of the 
Americans were waving little flags you see,
 showing their, their enthusiasm for, 
for their, for their countryme n winning or the country wome n winning.  That was 

the type of fanfare that you saw during the game s. 
 

Q: A lot of cheering. 

 

A: A lot of cheering.  That™s, that™s always the case you see.  They do a lot of 
cheering.  Although from my experience, 
you know, the athletes never hear it 
though.  They never hear what™s going on.  Cause they™re concentrating on what 

they™re doing.  They™re concentrating on that
 race.  So they don™t, they don™t hear 
the cheering.  They don™t even hear what people say. 
 

Q: Swastikas? 

 

A: I didn™t see any of that.  Didn™
t see any of that at all.  Di
dn™t see any of 
that at all. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit about your 
race and how you were feeling. 
 

A: Well I had to run three races.  I ha d to
 run the preliminaries and the semi -finals 
and the finals.  The preliminary race, the 
preliminaries and the, and the semi -final 
race.  When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I 

stayed out there and won the race on, on bot
h of those two races.  On the final 
race, I decide d well I™m going to try to exerci
se a little strategy to make sure that  I 
would win the race uh by laying back in 
second position, and then, of course, in 
the waiting until I hit the last
 three hundred meters and then st arting my kick to 
try to win the race. But the fellow, Phil Ed
wards, from Canada, he set a very, very 
slow pace.  And, of course, he set that 
pace and, and we, we ran that way for four 
hundred me ters, that™s half the race.  When we
 hit the first turn of the last, the last 
half of the race or the la
st four hundred me ters, the contestant s or my opponents 
crowded right around me .  I got boxed in. 
 And the only way I could get out of 
that box was to stop.  Now if I attempte
d to breakthrough, I would have fouled 
some body a nd I™d have been disqualified. 
 But I had enough sense to know that I 
couldn™t do that.  So I stopped.  So I let 
the, let, let my oppone nts proceed in front, 
ahead of me .  I ran out into the third lane
 and I then I ran around the field and won 
the race.  In fact I ran 
more than eight hundred meters when I won that race 
because I was running way out in the third la
ne see.  But I won it.  That was the 
most important thing.  And of course the 
old timers just said they never in the 
history of the, of the, of the Olympics
 had ever seen a race won the way I ran 

mi ne.  And you see, first of all, whenev
er you uh stop and you break your stride, 
you break your rhythm, that u, that usually 
finishes you.  But I was able to pick up 
even though I started the race 
twice and, and, and still won. 
 

Q: What drove you?   What drove you? 

 
 
17

17
 
A: Determine, determination.  My only object
ive at  any time I got into a race was to 
win.  And that™s what I did. 
 

Q: That™s what it takes? 

 

A: That™s what it takes.  Determination.  
Lot of fire in the stomach as they say. 
 

Q: Were you winning for you, for your country, for 

 

A: I was winning for me  and I was winning 
for the country.  Me first, then the 
country. 
 

Q: When you said you won, you were very casual about this.  This is a pretty 
momentous occasion.  I don™t think 
you probably felt that casually. 
 

A: Well, it, it was a mo ment ous occasion.  But I didn™t realize how i mportant  it was 
until it was all over with because ever ything ha
ppened so fast, just like I made the 
Olympic team very fast.  Didn™t know 
that I was going to be on the Olympic 
team, didn™t know I was going to be even 
try out for the Olympic team.  Then 
going to Germany and winning it.  But I didn
™t realize just  what achievement that  
I had accomplished until it was all over to r
eceive my me dal.  Uh we weren™t, we 
weren™t instructed as to how we were to salu
te you see.  So at one, one point I, I, I 
said well should I give a Nazi salute, 
should I give a, or should I give an 
American salute.  But I was very real 
confused, but nevertheless I finally ended 
up giving the American salute.  Cause 
I was nervous, very nervous and very 
confused.  I was a young, young ma n, and of
 course we weren™t given any 
instructions on that you see. 
 

Q: When you win a me dal, what™s the process here.  What happens?   You win the 
race, everyone™s cheering. 
 

A: All right.  When you™re up on the stan
d and they™re playing the Star Spangled 
Banner for all the Americans and of course they played the Star Spangl ed Banner 

for me  winning my race, you see.  Then 
they had young girls that came  over.  And 

the girls pr esented the medal.  They 
presented the me dal.  And some where, 
some where, some where later they presen
ted an oak, a little oak tree, which I 
brought back home  and that oak tree it was 
about 18, about 18 inches uh in height.  

I brought it back and then I had to send it to
 the Departme nt of Agriculture here in 
Washington cause they had to check the 
dirt around it for any kind of bugs that 
was being brought in.  So when they, when
 it was sent back to Connellsville, my 
home  town, the tree was almost dead.  
So I turned the tree over to the Botany 
teacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and 

they planted it on the library at , at, at 
the Carnegie Library in the home town.  
And then of course, they, they replanted it when they built the stadium, the Falcon 

Stadium is the name  of i t .  And that tree 
is now six feet tall.  And a lot of the 

 
 
18

18
acorns from that tree is being plante
d around different places around the United 
States, from, from my tree. 
 
Q: So you went to the stands, some body escorted you to the stands. 

 

A: Yes.  We ll, you know, you know, they showed you where, where you had to go in 
order to uh receive your, receive your, your
 me dal see.  And that™s, that™s what, 

that™s what they did you see.  See, I, I, I,
 I,  I won first.  Uh Maria Lansey from 
Italy was second.  I forget the third 
ma n who, who, who uh, no Phil Edwards, Phil 
Edwards from Canada, he was third.  He
 was third.  Now the two runners, two, 

two other, two other American runners, Ch
arles Hornsbarsel from University of 
Indiana or  Indiana University and Harry Williamson fr om North Carolina 

University, they came in, they came in fourth and, and fifth.  They didn™t, they 

didn™t uh they didn™t get a me dal see.  Ca
use they only give me dals for the first 
three pl aces. 
 

Q: So what was it like standing in front
 of a hundred thousand people accepting this 
honor?  
 

A: Very, it was, it was a very, very exciting 
experience.  As I said, I was, I was very 
nervous.  I was very nervous.  Everybody 
clapping their hands and cheering etc.  
It was nervous for a young ma n twenty-one 
years old, had never been so far away 
from home. 
 

Q: The Americans really cleaned 
up in these events didn™t they? 
 
A: Yes. We  did very well.  We did very well. 
 

Q: Was there any irony or satisfaction to ha
ving won this, won this race as a black 
American, gotten all of this
 prestige and honor for your c
ountry that didn™t always 
treat you so well? 
 

A: Well, of course we were a victim, bei
ng, myself personally, we were a victim of 
discrimi nation in, in, in, in the country 
of America for all those many years cause 
I™d only lived in the world for twenty-one 
years at that particular time .  And we 
understood that.  We  didn™t li
ke it.  We never do.  We  never did like it and we 
never will like it.  We  still have racism in 
this country.  This country is still full of 
racism as far as, as the black man is concerned.  Things are better than they used 

to be.  Much better.  Economically speak
ing, blacks are getting better jobs than 
they got back in those days.  They™re ab
le to go to any, any, 
any, any university in 
the country.  Cause back in those 
days you couldn™t go, you couldn™t go, you 
couldn™t go to University of Georgia or 
University of Mississippi and what you 
have back in those, back in those tim
es.  You couldn™t go to the Naval Academy 
back in those times.  We ll, get to tell you alittle experience 
in that, in that regard.  
We had a track meet to run at Annapolis, at the Na val Academy.  Now here I am 

an Olympic champion and they told my coach that I couldn™t run.  I couldn™t 

 
 
19

19
come .  So I had to stay ho me  because 
of discrimi nation.  Now that wasn™t hap, 
that wasn™t  the situation at West Point. 
 I ran at West point when I was going to 
the University of Pittsburgh, but I couldn™
t run at, at Annapolis.  But things are 
better now. 
 
Q: I just want to get back to being 
in Ge rmany, having lived through this and 
winning this me dal for your country. 
 

A: Now what was the question? 

 

A: Well actually we™ve only got a mi nute le
ft on the tape.  So maybe I™m going to 
stop and start again. 
 

(end Tape 2 of 30 

 

(Tape 3 of 3) 

 

Q: You™re going to be of hundreds of athl
etes and that ma de no difference.  That 
must have been a good feeling.  That sort of inclusiveness. 
 

(get a little mark)  

 

(We need to hear your voice again) 

 

A: You want to hear my voice again. 

 
(Beep) 
 

Q: I was asking you if there was any sort of
 special feeling or pride in being a black 
American winning the gold medal in Berlin? 
 

A: There was de finitely a special feeling 
in winning the gold me dal and being a, a 
black ma n because here I, here I was 
doing some thing and particularly, this 

particular event had not been won by an Amer
ican in 24 years.  So and it, that was 
won by a white ma n, not a black ma n.  So I was very proud of that, of that fact, 

very proud of that achieveme nt, and I was 
very happy for mys e lf as an individual, 
for my race, and for my country. 
 

Q: You had started to me ntion some thingabout auxiliaries.  What™s that about? 

 

A: Well after the Olympics were over, I th
ink it came at, I think it was published, it 
must have been published in the Ger, 
in, in, in the German publication, the 
German ne wspapers, that Hitler ma de the 
remark that if it wasn™t for the black 
auxiliary the American would 
not have won the Olympics.  That™s what I, that™s 
what I hear.  I didn™t read it, but I heard, 
heard that that was the rema rk that he 
ma de, you s ee. 

 
 
20

20
 
Q: How did that ma ke you feel? 

 

A: Well it, it made me, it made me feel 
good because what we did, we destroyed his 
ma ster race theory.  That™s what, it ma
de me  feel very good.  Cause you know he 
uh he had that ma ster race theory that 
you know the, the superior race, that only, 
only, only the pure Germans could do certain 
things in this world.  That was what 
he was advocating.  But we destroyed hi
s theory whenever we started winning 
those gold medals. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t your return home  as an 
Olympic hero.  How wer e  you 
received and where did you come  first? 
 

A: We ca me  to New York and they had a bi
g parade for us.  After the Olympics we 
came home, we came home on the S.S. 
Wa shington.  Now, of course, Jesse 
Owens came home ahead of us because he, he didn™t, he di dn™t do any running 

after the Olympics outside of Dresden, 
Germany.  One week after the Olympic 
game s, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germa ny, and 
of course he was defeated by Ralph 
Metcalfe who took second to him in the 
Olympic game s in Be rlin.  But he had 
some  offers that was ma de, some  pr ofessi
onal offers, and of course he came  back 
on the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary 
to take advantage of those offers cause 
Jesse came from a poor family too.  Most of the blacks came  from poor families 

you see.  None of, none of us ca me  from any we althy homes, or mi ddle class 

homes.  Most all fr om poor fa milies.  
But many of those offe rs didn™t pan out for 
him at all.  And of course they, due to 
the fact, you see he was scheduled to run 
in, in, in various countries.  He didn™t run 
so they declared him, they declared him 
as a professional.  So Jesse, his amateur da
ys were over with after that see.  But I 
ran after the Olympic games.  I ran in 
White City Stadium in London.  Then from 
there I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before co
mi ng home .  But we all, we all ended up 
in, in New York and they had a big ticke
r tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan 
up, up Fifth Avenue.  And there was a lo
t of cheering and if course Mayor 
LaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city 
at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a 
me dal uh from the City of New York.  A
nd then from there we all depa rted New 

York City and we went to our various homes.  And, of course, when I got back to 

Connellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a 
big parade for me in my, in my home 
town.  And which, which was the biggest para
de that ev, that ev
er turned out for 
anybody in that small town. 
 

Q: That must have felt fabulous. 

 

A: It was, it was, it was.  I was, it was, it was a fabulous time, a fabulous occasion, 
and a happy time for me and for my family 
and for all my friends back there in 
Connellsville. 
 

Q: How long did the euphoria last? 

 

 
 
21

21
A: Well it lasted for quite a, quite a l
ong time, you know, because you know I used to 
go out and, and do a lot of speaking to th
e young uh run uh kids 
after the Olympic 
game s and, of course, I was still in school 
and I was still, still ma king records as 
an athlete because I won every ma jor me
d, won e very ma jor er uh track meet in 
the country at that particular time.  
Right up until, right up until I stopped running 
in 1940. 
 
Q: Did winning the Olympics open doors fo
r you that wouldn™t have been opened 
otherwise? 
 

A: Some , some  doors.  Some doors, cause 
I, I never, you know, I, I was never ma de, 
I never ma de any uh never uh received any fabulous offers in terms of uh ma king 

any money because see first of
 all I was still in school a
nd I had three years.  I had 
three years to go to get my degree.  And 
when I was graduated.  Right after I was 
graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to Ne w York University 

and uh while I was in graduate school, 
I got a job at John Wannama ker™s running 
the elevator.  And of course you know ther
e was quite a lot of publicity came  out 
about an Olympic champion getting a job r
unning an elevator.  And the only thing 
that John Wa nnama ker wanted to do was 
give me  a per ma nent job running an 
elevator.  That was all.  Th
en I got a job as a social i
nvestigator for the city of 
New York, working with di
sadvantaged people who were on welfare.  Then I, 
then I got a job working, working for the 
uh police Athletic League, director of 
one of their centers up in, up in Harlem
, New York, working with disadvantaged 
kids.  And while I was working in that 
job, I took examination for State Parole 
Officer for the State of New York and 
I became a parole officer, supervising 
parolees who were released from the  Ne
w York State Reformatory, reformatories 
or state prisons.  Then from that I worked for a short period of time with Shefland 

and Company uh advertising alcoholic beverages.  I didn™t particularly care for 

that cause I couldn™t see myself ma king, 
ma king a permanent job pushing booze.  
So I got out of that.  Then I got a job 
as special inves, uh, 
uh insurance agent for 
the Prudential Insurance Company.  I worked
 a while in that job.  Then I ended up 
my career with the Job Corps Program.  
You know about the Job Corps program.  
Again  working with disadvantaged kids.  
I never made a lot of money, but I made 
a living.  But my, but my , the compensation 
that I got from the work that I did 
was helping people.  And I helped 
a lot of people, a lot of people. 
 

Q: Did the, being an Olympic winner open doors in other ways? 

 

A: Well not uh not, not, not to my e
xperience, not from my experience. 
 

Q: –get you access to places that you we ren™t able to go into before? 

 

A: I can™t, I can™t recall just looking ba
ck on, on, on my early, early career after 
winning the Olympics that it opened a
ny particular doors, being a gold medal 
winner. 
 

 
 
22

22
Q: Did you expect it to? 
 

A: Well I expected that I had hope.  Nut noth,nothing ma terialized in, in that regard.  
Now I™ m sure ma ny o f the white Olympians 
were ma de offers, very fine offers, 
but I can™t recall any of the black Ol
ympians ma king any, any, making any great 
offers.  Now Jesse did pretty well.  He 
got in public relations work, but when he 
first came back from the  Olympic game s, he, he, he, he, he found it very difficult 

to get any decent, any decent work.  He 
came back.  He ran against race horses.  

You ma y ha ve heard of, heard of him 
running against race horse.  He did a 

number of things in order 
to track, try to ma ke a living for his fa mily. But only in 

later years he, he uh he started a public 
relation organization there in Chicago, and 
he did a lot of uh did a lot of he was on 
a lot of speaking engageme nts.  And he 
picked up quite a bit of money doing that
.  But uh he didn™t have any, any, any 
big jobs.  He never had any r
eal, any real big jobs, you know. 
 

Q: What I was trying to get at
 here is it seems that afte
r all of the exciteme nt of 
winning this me dal, winning this race, coming back to all kinds of parades, how 

long did it kind of take to come  back to
 earth and realize that things hadn™t 
changed mu ch?   We re there any mome nts 
that kind of showed you that clearly? 
 

A: Yes.  When I came back, when I came b
ack to the University of Pittsburgh, they 
didn™t want , they didn™t want to let me
 into the English class because I was a 
month late.  And of course
 I guess the chancellor strai
ghtened that ma tter out.  
Then when I, one, one day I went down
town Pittsburgh, and one evening, to 
Child™s restaurant.  They refused to serve me .  Tha t  was, that was one instance.  

Then when I was graduated and they had 
the uh University Hall of Fame, here I™d 
brought international, intern
ational recognition to the sc
hool.  The All American 
football players like Marshall Goldberg, th
ey brought national recognition to the 
school.  They ma de the Hall of Fame, but I 
didn™t ma ke it.  In spite of the gold 
me dal that I™d won and bringing the sc hool 
international recognition.  So that, that 
let me  know just what the situation wa
s.  Things hadn™t changed.  But I was 
young and, of course, as years went on, thi
ngs got better.  And uh and to date 
things have gotten much better for the black
s.  But we still have a long wa y to go. 
 

Q: Ask you a little bit about what was goi
ng on, what was unfolding in Germany and 
in Europe.  When after the Olympics 
did you become  more aware of what was 
going on and you know how did you find out? 
 

A: Well, I personally became  a, aware of what was going on based on, based on the, 
on the publications on, on what was, what was uh printed in, in the various 

newspapers and, and, and, and ma ga zines of
, of what was happening in Germany.  
Of course right after the Olympics, in 
1039, Hitler started World Wa r II when he 
ma rched on Czechoslovakia, that was the 
beginning of World 
Wa r II.  And of 
course we all knew what happened after that. 
 

 
 
23

23
Q: How did you get that information.  How di
d you start learning more.  Is that the 
point at which you became  more 
aware of the atrocities and 
 
A: Yes, my, become  aware of those atrociti
es and things from what, from what was 
printed in the, in the, in the, in the newspaper.  Newspapers through, you know, 

throughout, throughout the United States. 
 

Q: After having this glorious week in Berlin was this hard to believe? 

 

A: Yes it was very hard to believe.  It was 
very hard to believe.  But we knew what 
was going on based on the publicity prior to 
the Olympic games, what Hitler was 
doing.  And as I said he declared a 
moratorium, opened up everything, ma de 
everythi ng ve ry pleasant, very accommodating for, for the visiting uh, uh 

Olympic team nations.  But after the Olympics they went right back to the, to the 

things he had planned.  And, of course, al
l these things he had planned was laid 
out in his book, Mein Kampf. 
 

Q: So the Olympics were 
really a propaganda coup. 
 

A: It was.  He ma de it so.  He ma de it 
a propaganda coup to further, to further his 
cause, to further his program that he had set up. 
 

Q: When you started learning more about all 
the horrible things that were happening, 
did you think about the Olympics in context 
of politics at all or
 were you just still 
feeling the same  way you did at age 21? 
 
A: Well, I would think it was pretty muc h 
the latter, pretty much the latter.  Cause 
we™d had some  background on what was going on prior to the game s, and of 
course it was brought out more pointedly 
after the game s.  Se e when after the 
game s were over then Hitler continued 
with his program, you see. Marching on 
Czechoslovakia and starting, st
arting the war.  And of course it was some thing 
that uh we more or less 
expected.  We more or less expected.  You know uh the 
world didn™t think Hitler was doing what 
he was doing.  You see they should have 
known what he was doing.  You know, Ge
r many was part of the League of 
Nations, like all the nations were, were pa
rt of that League.  And the, the reason 
that they set that league up as you know 
from history was to more or less keep a 
tab on each nation in terms of
 them building up war arma me nts to st art a war.  
Now Hitler withdrew from the League of 
Nations.  They should have known then 
what he was going to do.  But they didn™t 
believe him.  They didn™t believe him.  
They didn™t believe what he had printe
d in that book, Mein Kampf.  Wi nst on 
Churchill, the Prime Minister of Engla
nd, called hi m the little Corporal.  They 
down played Hitler.  They didn™t believe, 
believe what he was about to do.  So 
therefore they, they didn™t
 put a curb on him see.  They probably could have 
stopped Wo rld Wa r II if they had done so at
 that time.  When he withdrew from 
the League of Nations, if they™d of 
put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that 

 
 
24

24
particular time, there probably would have
 beenno World War Ii
.  But they didn™t 
do it. 
 
Q: Do you think if we had believed what 
was going to happen and had exercised a 
boycott, it would have made any difference? 
 

A: Exercised a boycott of the Olympics? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: I don™t know whether it would have ma de a
ny difference or not.  I really don™t.  I, 
I can™t, I coul dn™t , I can™t
 answer that question. 
 

Q: In retrospect, cause I know how you fe
lt at the time, learning how bad things 
became, do you think we should have  participated in the Olympics? 
 

A: Well in retrospect, based, based on a
ll the traini ng that the athletes had gone 
through in preparing for the Olympic game s,
 I fee l , I felt that they should have 
had, they should have gone on with the Olympics as they di d.  Because I think 

that would, that would ha ve been a ve ry 
bad thing to have taken place.  Uh but it 

would been, it would have been very hur
ting for the athletes who had ma de so 
much preparation, who had trained so long 
over the years.  Fortunately for me  I 
didn™t train like that.  I was more or less a 
gifted athlete.  I ca
me  up very fast.  But 
there was other athl etes who had traine
d for the Olympics who had trained for 
years to prepare for the game s, and that would have been very, very bad if they 

could not have gone.  That™s my, that™s 
my feeling, personal feeling.  Now there 
mi ght, there mi ght be others who felt who 
would feel differently about it based on 

the question you just posed to 
me, but that™s my feeling. 
 

Q: That the Olympics and po
litics should stay separate. 
 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: Let™s take a break. 

 

Q: There are a couple of specific questions
 I want to ask you.  You had me ntioned 
one incident where you had contact with a Ge
rman athlete at the Olympic village.  
Did you have other contact with German athletes? 
 

A: That was the only one.  I reme mber 
this young ma n that came  in.  He was young 
like we were and uh he came  and visited with us, you see.  And of course when 

we heard all this uh this information 
about Hitler and naturally we posed a 
question.  What did they th
ink, what did the German people think of Hitler.  And 
he said they, he said they
 thought he was a, a very good 
ma n because of what he™d 
done for the country economically speaking, ma de it possible for all of them to 

work and of course you know all of them 
were working in the, in the, in these 

 
 
25

25
factories where they were ma king we apons. And that™s why they felt, cause right 
after World War I, you know, the Germans 
they really were beat down.  They 
were, they were in a bad way.  And I guess 
they, they were, they were, they were 
looking, they were looking for a savior.  
And that™s when Hitler came into, came 
into play.  They were looking for some
body to pull them out of those doldrums 
that they were in, you see.  And of c ourse
 when he withdrew from the League of 
Nations, started building all, all this, 
all this war arma ment, putting all these 
German people to work, he was a great guy 
as far as they were concerned.  But 
they didn™t know, they 
didn™t know the whole story. 
 

Q: Did you have contact with 
other international athletes? 
 

A: No.  No.  No. 

 

Q: Was there much of a bond, camaraderie th
at should have lasted with the other 
athletes after the Olympics? 
 

A: With other athletes from, from other teams. 

 

Q: Fromhere. 

 

A: Oh, yes, yeah there was quite a, qu
ite a, quite a bond, you know.  We  be, we 
became very, very close friends and we (w
ords mi ssing in original transcript ).  
The other athletes on the team were very 
close.  I was very close to them.  I™m 
still very close to some  of them that are,
 that are still around.  
I still make contact 
with them, you see.  And uh, but of course
, ma ny of them are gone, ma ny of them 
have passed.  And as I said I™m the only one
 that ™s left  now see.  Archie Williams 
who won the 400 me ters, he died about three years ago.  And he was the last of 
the gold me dal winners, other than 
myself, that were still living. 
 

Q: So there was really a special bond? 

 

A: Oh yes.  Stronger than 
a fraternity.  Stronger, much
 stronger than a fraternity 
because of what we go through in training 
and what have you, the pain, feeling of 

pain when we™re training, the feeling of pa
in when we, when we race.  That, that, 
that gives us a lot of strength and a lot of
.  It™s some thing that we have in common 
with each other.  And some thing that we understand.  You see one athlete 

understands another athlete and what he 
has to go through.  If he™s a football 
player, a football playerunderstands what another f
ootball player has to go 
through.  And that™s the same  wa
y with in track and field. 
 

Q: When did you become  friendly with Marty Glickman?  

 

A: We lived in the same  neighborhood up in
 New Rochelle, New York.  His family 
and my fa mi ly live in the same  neighborhood. 
 

 
 
26

26
Q: But you me t  at the Olympics? 
 

A: We me t at the Olympics.  Marty Glickman
 and I met in the Olympics as part of 
the team.  I didn™t know him before that
, but I knew him a f
ter that, after the 

Olympics where he resided in New Rochel
le and where I resided with my  fa mily 
in New Rochelle, New York. 
 

Q: Do you remember hi m a t  the Olympics? 

 

A: I used to see him on occ a sion, because he
 was a sprinter.  And I used to see Sam 
Stoller also.  Incidentally Sa m 
Stoller, is Sam Stoller dead? 
 

Q: From your me mory of 1936, what
 kind of guy was Marty Glickman? 
 

A: A nice fellow.  Very nice fellow.  Very 
friendly, as all the athletes that were on 
the team we re all very friendly, all ve ry
 cordial, all very accommodating.  Which 
is like one big happy family. 
 

Q; Was there anything that set him apart in your mi nd/ 

 

A: No.  No.  He  was just another, he was ju
st anot her athl ete like 
all the rest of them 
that were over there to wi n, win a gold me
dal and I was very, very sorry that he 
didn™t get that opportunity to do so. 
 

Q: Did you go to the closing ceremonies? 

 
A; The closing ceremonies at the, at the, 
the closing ceremonies at Berlin?  Yes.  
Yes. 
 
Q: Tellme. 

 

A: It was very, very exciting.  The closing ceremonies were very, very exciting 
because I, because I witnessed the closi
ng ceremonies on the, on the other, other 

Olympic games that I attended.  But, but 
this one was, was much more i mportant 
because I was part of it.  And they
 put on quite a show.  Quite a show. 
 

Q: Tell me  about it. 

 

A: Well the closing, well they uh had the, ha
d the, had the, had the athletes.  Of 
course one thing about the 
closing ceremonies. The clos
ing ceremonies are not as 
exciting as the opening ceremonies because 
a lot of the athletes after competing 
go home .  So not the whole team, the whol
e team is never there at the closing 
ceremonies.  So therefore uh it, it™s 
not quite as exciting as the opening 

ceremonies when they march in, each country
 with their flag and of course with 
the Olympic flag preceding all, pr eceding everyt hi ng, you see.  The five ring 

 
 
27

27
Olympic flag.  But uh it™s not, as I said, 
it™s not as exciting, 
but it™s, it™s still 
exciting for those who participated in the closing ceremonies. 
 
Q: What did it look like? 

 

A: Well it looked like uh a closing cerem
ony.  That™s all I can say.  I don™t know 
what you™re 
 

Q: I™ve never been to one.  I don™t even know
 what the opening ceremonies look like. 
 

A: Well the opening ceremony™s when all thes
e various nations, all these, all these uh 
Olympic athl etes repr esenting all these va
r, various nations ma rch in.  The host, 
the host, the host country athletes ma rch 
in last.  It™s all 
set up you know, it™s all 
set, it™s all organized.  And, of course, a
ll these countries, it™s
, it™s preceded by the 
Olympic flag, the five ring flag.  And of 
course right after they ma rch in and the 
game s are, are declared open, they ha ve
 pigeons.  And they release all these 

pigeons and they all fly, a
nd that™s the opening of the game s.  It™s beautiful. 
 

Q: You were on the field at that time? 

 

A: On the field.  As part of the American
 team.  We came in with our white trousers, 
blue jackets and straw hats
, with a red, red, white and 
blue band.  White shirt and, 
and I forget what our tie, I think our tie 
was, I think our tie was, I think our tie 
was white if I recall.  We just, it™s 
been a little while.  But I re me mber, I 
reme mber, I reme mber the hat.  I reme mber the jacket and I reme mber the 

trousers.  And of course white shoes. 
 

Q: How were you feeling marching across there? 

 

A: Oh, felt good, felt good.  You know you alwa
ys, always felt good ma rching in a 
parade.  Always did.  It, it, it, it kind of does some thing to you. 
 

Q: It must have been great. 

 

Q; It was.  It was. 

 

Q: Is there anything else that you reme mber
 about sort of what the stadium looked 
like, what the track was like?   Wa s 
it similar to other tracks that you had 
competed on? 
 

A; It was a very beautiful track, very fine 
track.  It was ma de with some  kind of red 
uh red dirt, red cinders or some thing.  It wa s different.  It wasvery different than, 

than, than the tracks here in America at 
that particular time.  And when I was over 
there for the 50
th
 anniversary and I got a chance to, to visit the track again, that 
track was st ill in excellent condition.  A
ll the facilities that 
the Germans built for 

 
 
28

28
the 1936 Olympic game s, they did a ma
rvelous job.  A ma rvelous job and 
everythi ng was still intact
, even today, even today. 
 
Q: Did the weather cooperate? 

 

A; Cooperated very well.  We had no, 
we had no inclement weather at all.
