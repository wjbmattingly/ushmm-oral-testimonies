KURT JULICH 
 October 31, 2006 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Kurt. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: It™s ni ce to be with you here in Delray Beach. 

A: Pleasure. 

Q: Kurt, when were you born? 

A: August 10
th
, 1922. 
Q: And wha t  was your name  then? 

A: Kurt Julich. 

Q: So it™s the same  na me now? 

A: Sa me name. 
Q: Can you spell your last name? 
A: Julich. 

Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: In Cologne, Germany. 

Q: And l-let™s talk a little b
it about your -- your family and your
 brother. So tell me  what did 
your father do? 

A: My father had a business in Cologne, and -- 

Q: You know what kind? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. At that time -- we™re talking in
 the 30™s, it was very fa
shionable that lady used 
to wear lacy jabot 
and things like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511

Q: What is a lace jabot? 
A: It™s those -- 

Q: Jacket? 

A: -- those things there that, you know, puffy lace, you know? 

Q: Ah, ah, I see. 

A: And then also lace for decoration of various 
dresses, gowns , whatever. And also buttons in 
mother of pearl, and basically th
at™s what it was. He had an o
ffice acro -- pretty much across the 
street in Cologne [indecipherable] where the eau 
de Cologne, which is called corniche eswassa, 
have their offices. 4711 is the name  of the cologn
e, which will be on every bottle, so his office 
was across the street, you know?  A
nd a fairly large office with, of course, what you would call 
the storage area for the product and whatnot. And fe
w e mployees and a partner. So he was on the 
road half of the time , selling, and then he switche
d with his partner and he stayed in the office 
and did the paperwork as it would be , and so on a
nd so forth. And then of course when Hitler 
came, and it was before Hitler was sworn in, he couldn™t ma ke -- he wasn™t allowed to make a 
living any more. You see, history 
has a way of being a little bit mi
staken at times. He had to stop 
his business in ™32, before Hitler 
was actually swor n in as the h
ead ma n there, as it would be. 
Q: Why did he have to stop? 

A: Because Jews weren™t allowed to have a business any more. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And so my grandfather, who lived a few -- 
you know, fe w miles out in a very lovely town 
called Siegburg. And he had the very large hous
e there. And so my father, mother and my 
brother and I, we went to live ther
e. And I lived ther
e until 1933, August 17
th
, when I left for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
3 
 
 
France and I got some  Fr ench tutoring lessons be
fore I went there, but I had taken French in 
what you commonly call in Germany, gymnasium. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Which would be sort of lik
e high school - college mi xture because you can start with -- like 
you don™t even have to go to a public school, you 
can start and finish pretty much, you know and 
graduate there. So I was in one of these a
nd their ma in language was French. And obviously I 
had the heads up for French, you know? 

Q: Right. Tell me  some thing about
 what your father was like wh
en you were growing up, before 
-- before you left and before you have to m
ove fr om Cologne to your grandfather™s and 
grandmother™s house. 

A: We ll, he wa -- 

Q: We re you close with your father? 

A: Oh yeah. He was -- he was really strict, 
but he was perfect, you know
?  No nonsense, but he 
loved us very much. And he was on the road th
e whole week and he came home  Friday night, 
you know, for religious purposes, I 
guess, you know. And Saturday 
and Sunday and that allowed 
him to catch up on his accounting for what he di
d during the week, also. 
So I saw him Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday, Monday he was gone again. 
And actually, I would say -- how old was I?  
Maybe seven, eight -- six, seven, eight years old, 
I don™t know for sure, he got sick and tired of 
traveling with those big sample cases, so he 
hired -- he bought a car a
nd he hired a chauffeur, 
because he was not very adept at driving. That wasn™t hi s forte. At that time  obvi -- obviously he 

had to shift, so he had the chauffeur and in th
e morning it was very nice, the chauffeur took us 
around the block to the school. You know, I was 
in what you call grade school, you know, it was 
very nice. And oh, of course, that ceased af
ter a little while, as
 -- it™s quite obvious.

Q: What was your father™s name, his first name? 
A: Leo. 

Q: Leo. And what about your mother
?  Your mother™s name  is what? 
A: Martha. 

Q: Mm-hm. And what was she like? 

A: Perfect. 

Q: She was perfect. 

A: Angel. Wonderful. And she -- well, like I sai
d, she was born in my grandfather™s town, which 
was like oh, let™s say 10 miles away. It was a sm
all town called Siegburg, which was very, very 
picturesque. I mean, without seei
ng a picture, you can™t believe it,
 but -- and so my gr andfather 
had plenty of room there. She had three sisters 
who were, when I was born, ma iden aunts, and I 
guess this is why I loved wome n, b
ecause I was always pamp ered, I was -- first of all, I was the 
first ma le grandchild around, so you know, it™s -- 
left an impression on me, I had three lovely 
aunts, you know? 

Q: And did your father have
 siblings, did your fa -- 
A: Yeah. My father had one
 sister and two brothers. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: He happened to be a twin. My grandmother 
on my father™sside 
had 12 children, of which 
eight died. You know, it wasn't  like nowadays, 
you know. Didn™t have the me dications to keep 
you alive and what not. And so four
 -- four of them lived. His twin died, he survived. He had two 

brothers, and one sister. And th
ey lived little bit further away
 in a beautiful town in the 
mountains, in the Eyffel. It was called Münster Eyffel. Münster is sort of like an abbey, and then 

Eyffel is the mountain, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
5 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And it was up in the mountains and it was a re
sort town for pulmonary problem people. And 
it was, I don™t know, a thousand y
ears old, and things [indecipherable] have pictures about all 
this, which words don™t describe 
everything properly, a picture 
is worth a thousand words --  
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- we -- we all know that, you know. So -- and so we went a few time s here. We  were much 

closer to my  mother™s -- 

Q: Mm-hm, fa mily. 

A: -- family, obviously, it™s alwa
ys the way, you know. Children are closer to their mother than 
they are to the father, it™s -- it™s normal, the 
father is on the road, he
™s working, and then of 
course, his family, his father was sort of like I don™t know what, relig
ious in the synagogue, 
something or something. And my sister married
 a Christian man, wonderful fellow who had a 

furniture factory up in that particul ar place, refi
nishing antiques and all that, it was ma rvelous. 
He had two children, a daughter and a son. The reas
on I say daughter first is
 because she was the 
oldest, the son was second. And well, when we we
nt -- went visiting once in awhile, he took us 

out early in the morning in the woods so we 
could see the deers. You know, and it was bu -- 
beautiful scenery, you know. 

Q: And who is this, one of your moth
er™s sister, who 
ma rried this guy? 
A: Beg pardon? 

Q: Who -- who are you talking about now?  The -- 

A: My -- my  fa -- my father™s si ster. 

Q: Your father™s sister? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511

Q: I see. And what was your mother™s name ? 
A: Martha Koppel, K-o-p-p-e-l. 

Q: So did she -- did you have ma ids in the house, 
did she take care of you? You did have ma ids. 
So you -- was -- 

A: Well -- well -- ha -- ha -- haf -- th-things were
 going quite well, we ha
d a sleep-in ma id, so 
when my pa rents wanted to go out
, the ma id stayed with us -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- you know, and things like that. 

Q: Was your mother a cook? 

A: Y-Yes, yes, as a ma tter of fact, when they 
left Germany a nd went to France, and after than 

when they came  to the United States, she was 
a -- I wouldn™t call it co
 -- you know, there™s cooks 
-- cooks, and then there is chefs. 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: No, she was a gourmet chef. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh, the same  way -- we are not talking abou
t oh -- I wouldn™t insult my wife by calling her a 
cook, she was a chef, because what she coul
d do without fat, cooki
ng and baking, was mi nd 
boggling. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Or let™s say mi ni mu m of fat. My mother loved -- she ma de the most ma rvelous cakes and 

whatnot, but if a quarter pound of butter 
is good, half a pound of 
butter is better. 
Q: Right. 

A: And six eggs -- six eggs would just barely
 cut it. So obviously it 
had to be perfect. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
7 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Taste-wise. 

Q: Do you -- do you reme mber her food as a -- as a child? 

A: Of course. 

Q: So she cooked a lot when you were a kid? 

A: Yes, yes, no, she -- she cooked. I mean, even when
 we had ma ids, I -- I di -- I was small when 
we had ma ids, you know, and I don™t reme mber at
 that time what she was doing. But later on, I 

mean, in -- in Germany, I reme mber later on when she was cooking, when we didn't have a ma id 

any more. And then in Fr ance, of course, and then of course when they came  to the United 

States, mi nd boggl -- it™s li -- France was very 
bad because starting in 1940 when the Germans 

overran France, until the end of the war, they 
plundered France with efficiency unparalleled in 
the history. There wasn™t a thing to be had for th
e French [indecipherable]. And then the French -
- I came here in ™48, in ™48 I still haven™t seen
 white bread in France. And it was still rationed, 
there was nothing to eat. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I -- I wasn™t exactly a heavyweight when I came over -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you know [indecipherable] 

Q: Tell me  about your youngest brother, Harry. 

A: Harry?  

Q: What was it like for you when he was born?
 Was this a great thing for you, or wou -- did you 
feel invaded? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
8 
 
 
A: I -- I loved my brother becau
se he was my brother. On 
the other hand, he was not as 
affectionate as I was. I™m a loving, touchy, 
feely type guy. He™s not, you know?  So everybody is 
different, you know?  And he is more of a scie
ntif -- scientist, you 
know?  When he came over 
here, he went  to college. He™s a little younger, 
a year and a ha lf, and he became a physicist, and 
with a lot of degrees and things like 
that. And he thinks like a physicist. 
Q: What was he like when he was a kid, when 
-- when -- when you were growing up together?  
A: Well -- 
Q: Before -- before France now, before -- 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, I reme mber that. He  used to 
be, shall we say, a shade abrasive, and he wasn™t 
all that tall, so I used to ha
ve to fight his fights for him. 
I didn't want anybody beating up my 
little brother, hm? Not that 
he reme mbers that, but I do. 
Q: Wa s he more like your mother -- 

A: No, no, no, no. 
Q: -- or your father?  Wa s he more like your father, you think? 
A: Not even. 

Q: Not even that. So he -- 

A: Not even. He was -- he was his own person. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know. My mother was very loving, my 
father, in his own way wa s very loving, you 
know. 

Q: Mm. 

A: And warm. Of course I can™t 
say anything that my brother isn™
t that way, but he doesn™t sh -- 
show it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- you know, physically. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know. 

Q: Right. 

A: So everybody™s different. 

Q: Yes. Did you like school? 

A: I don™t know. I went to school because I had to. 
I mean, it™s as simple as all that. In Germany 
you do what you™re told. 

Q: Right. 

A: End of discussion. 

Q: But -- but di -- did you happen to
 like it?  Or you don™t even reme mber ? 
A: Oh, I went to school because that™s some th
ing you had to do. I have no likes for it. As a 
ma tter of fac t , when I was nine years old, my 
father send me  to the local gymnasium, a nd you 
know, they have uniforms there, the caps, the whole mc gilly, you know, everything. And what 

was our language?  I™m ni ne years old, reme mber
 that. Latin. Well no, try as I mi ght, there was 
no way wa -- that I was going to go cut -- cut it in 
Latin. So after six months my father took me  
out, put me  in another one where the language was 
French like I me ntioned before, so that was 
piece of cake.  

Q: Right. You were supposed to speak Latin?  Or just read it? 

A: No, the whole thing -- 

Q: You -- you™re supposed to speak -- 

A: -- the whole thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511

Q: Really? 
A: Not just reading, understa
nding, spelling and talking. 
Q: And did Harry go to that school? 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: He didn™t. 

A: Harry was a year and a half younger. 

Q: Right. 

A: So henceforth, by that time -- you see, Hitler 
came  into power and we went -- we had to leave 
-- you see, in Germany when I went to -- what 
do you call that, gramma r 
school I would say?   
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We ll, they didn™t ma ke a-any di fferentiation. 
There wasn™t that much
 antici -- anti-Semitism 
in Germany in spite of what peopl
e will say. We went to school, school had catechism,  so I sat in 
with the Christian children and I got catechism. 
No big deal. I got my Jewish education after 
school, you know?  Several days a week we went a
nd we had Jewish education in a different 
place. 

Q: We re your parents religious in any way? 

A: Well yes, I mean, for the holid
ays yes, but when I went to my
 grandfather, very religious, 
Friday night synagogue, Saturday morning s
ynagogue, Saturday afternoon or evening 
synagogue, right?  Of course holidays obviously. And I 
got so good in Hebrew th
at at the ripe old 
age of -- by 11 I left Germany, so I had to be 10, 
and I was living with them because I couldn™t -- 
we weren™t allowed in a Christia
n school any mo re, so we went to the Jewi sh school that the 
rabbi was running in my grandfather™s town. I 
could conduct the service 
at 10 years old. There 
was some  ki ds my age that were 
actually better than me yet.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
11 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: They rattled it off like machine gun. But th
e world has a way of changing, and we change 
with it. 

Q: So you went to a Jewish school when you were 10, in 1932, not 1933? And that was because 

you had to do that? 

A: Jew -- Jewish children were not allowed to go
 to a regular school w
ith Christian children. 
Q: In 1932? 

A: ™32. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I mean, I don™t know whatever the date is, Apr
il of ™33 Hitler came  to power, whatnot. Yeah, 
but that was just on paper. He 
owned the place from 1930 or ™31 on.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: His goons were running everything. And believe
 me , the terror that they initiated in the 
population -- we™re talking Jews, you -- you have to 
live through it to underst
and the total feeling 
of terror, with the brownshirts, which was calle d the SA, sturm abteilung. 
Forget the SS, the SS 
is some thing totally different. And they were
 ma rching, had parades every Sunday, flags. Of 
course, you locked up your place and what not,and hoped that nothing bad would happen. But it 

was frightening, I™m telling you. 

Q: So you were very fr
ightened as a child? 
A: We ll, as a child you take everything in stride
. The one thing that the Germans were fabulous 
on, they created those what you would call Hitler t
ype songs with the very
 marshalltype music, 
and that appeals to the ma sses. You -- you have
 [indecipherable] every 
country has their own 
type of marshall music. The Germans are the best
. The French are not bad. The United States is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
12 
 
 
so-so, because we™re not really all that ma rshall. You know, we have a few songs. The Marine s, 
you know. A-And -- and -- and [indecipherable] the Na
vy, Air Force, but it™s not really -- but the 
Germans, I mean, they have th -- a song for every occasion, or a ma rch. And I™m telling you, 

there was one song I reme mber, and it™s [speaks Ge
rman here]. Translation - when blood -- when 
the Jewish bl ood spurts from the knife, then things
 will be twice as good. So 
that™s was a -- wa -- 
one of the lyrics in the so
ngs. I don™t know where people know 
these things. These are mi nor 
details. 

Q: Do you reme mber hearing that song as a kid? 

A: Of course. How -- why -- why w
ould I reme mber it to this day? 
Q: And who -- who sang it -- when -- do you remember when you heard it? 

A: The -- the SA troops ma
rching in the streets. 
Q: And they sang? 

A: And on the radio, and wherev
er you went that -- and they 
had more, you know, that™s just 
one, that™s the most bloody of them. Hate the Jude
n [speaks German]. I mean, hang the Jews, kill 
the bosses, or something like that
, I mean like that™s the most ma rvelous songs. I me a n horrible, 

horrifying. If you were a Jew, and you understood th
is, the terror was unbelie
vable. And it didn™t 
ma tter, because he appealed -- first of all, th
e mi stake was ma de in the tret -- Treaty of 
Versailles, where they ma de Germany pay unbelie
vable reparations that 
they couldn™t handle, 
and Germany was really in a bad way. So, lot of
 people out of work and things like that, people 
wound up in prison, Hitler saw his chance. He took the worst elements out of prison, the people 

out of work, hung a beautiful uniform on them, ni
ce jack boots, nice cap. [indecipherable] and 
everything, had them marching. Tr ied to get th
em job, oh, whatever you take away from the 
Jews, you know, all right?  So, th-th-these weren™
t the nicest people in 
the world that were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
13 
 
 
enrolled in those troops, I can™t call them st
rup -- storm troops, even though it says sturm 
abteilung, right?  Sturm means storm, you know, but
 that™s not the -- th
e SS is like I said, 
something totally apart. But they weren™t ni ce 
people. The head ma n was Mr. Wor m, and he was 
also a very disreputable character, you know, out
 of prison, and all kinds of quirks shall we say. 
So, i t  wa s  hor r i bl e . 
Q: Did it surprise you that there was so much 
anti-Semitism?  You say you didn™t gr ow up with a 

lot of anti-Semitism.  

A: No. Wa s -- 

Q: It didn™t sur -- it di dn™t surprise you? 

A: You see my father, the last free elect
ion, he volunteered for the election board. 
Q: Mm. 

A: You know, because there was othe r people runni
ng than Hitler. And alre
ady at that time it 
was a losing proposition because Hitler promised 
all ki nds of things to the ma sses, whi c h he 
actually implemented eventually, which the ot her 
people didn™t have the nerve to come up with 
things like that. So, you know, that™s why I say, h
it -- Hitler ran the show way before he was 
elected. 

Q: But let me  ask you some thing, Kurt, you™re a child. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You™re 10 years old in 1932. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So there™s a lot you don™t know, or necessarily understand. 

A: Exactly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
14 
 
 
Q: What™s -- what™s happening between you a
nd your friends?  Do your Christian friends stop 
being friends with you?  Do you 
live in a neighborhood where it™s 
mi xed?  What™s -- what goes on 
with you as a child? 
A: We ll, when I went to my -- wh-when I coul
dn™t go to Christian school any more, regular 

school, and my next door neighbor, I 
used to be friends with the boy, he was a little bit older than 
me . I don™t know whether he stopped being friend
s with me , I™m -- I really don™t know for sure. 
But then I associated with all the children that we
nt to the Jewi sh school that were in my grade, 
boys and girls, and things like that. So I did 
not associate with Chri
stian children any more. 
Q: So no one said some thing to you? No -- no -- some body was [indecipherable] 

A: No rema r ks were ma de, no. 

Q: Right. 

A: No, no. 

Q: Right. Now, when was the decision ma de, a
nd were you involved in a discussion about -- you 
were leaving to go to France?  
You were just told you were goi
ng to go? Did you not want to do 
it, or did you think that this was exciting? 

A: Re me mb er, in Germany you do what you™re to
ld, okay?  As much as you™re being loved, you 
feel that that is the right th
ing, if your parents -- if your pare
nts, your father, your mother tell 
you, look, you™re going to France to Uncle Pierre
 and Aunt Emma, you know, because things 
here -- well, I realized how f -- how bad things
 were. So my fa ther was smart enough, the oldest 
son, he got se -- out of Germany first. It was on my 11
th
 birthday, basically. And I got on the 
railroad, on -- my aunt must have picked me  up 
in Paris and we lived in Rennes at the time. 
Q: So this is August of 1933? 

A: Yeah, August 17
th
, 1933, I left Germany.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
15 
 
 
Q: So that -- 
A: Was a week after my 11
th
 birthday. And then I went to live with my a unt and uncle. My -- my 
uncle was a French career officer. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He was a doctor, right?  And he met my Aunt
 Emma during the occupati
on of first -- of the 
first World War. After the first World War, he
 was sent -- French troops were occupying the 
Rhineland with the British. And he
 met my aunt in Germany, in her hometown, and they hit it off 
some how. And then of course, an o
fficer is called to duty wherever it
™s called, so then he went to 
the Middle East, and he went to 
the bak -- Balkans, and things lik
e that. So they got ma rried in 
1930 in our -- in our apartment in Cologne, they 
have a very large house. I me an hous e, a very 
large apartment. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Actually, we had -- which was totally unheard of
 at the time, we had a bathroom like in the 
United Stat es where the bath and the toilet and th
e sinks, everything is in one, and then we had a 
separate toilet. And we had two entrances, one fo
r the servers and one for the regular people. So 
it was quite large, and I reme mber the weddi
ng quite well. And they got ma rried by us, you 
know, was [indecipherable] his fami ly couldn™t be th
ere, was in Germany, hi
s fra -- fa -- parents, 
his brother lived in France. So anyway, so they 
got ma rried there, this I remember, henceforth -- 
and then she left  with him to live wherever  
he was stationed, which was Rennes. And that™s

 the tape  and change it.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Kurt, so you knew your aunt and uncle 
when you -- before you went to see them? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: We re they older than your mother
 and father, much older, or -- 

A: My aunt was two to four years older 
than my mother. I think two years, ma ybe. 
Q: But na -- so there wasn™t a big difference? 

A: No, no. She -- there -- she -- 
she looked pretty much
 -- they looked pretty much alike, my 
aunt -- the one that I went to, and my mother. 
And -- and my uncle was born in ™89, so by that 
time it -- no -- yeah, ™89 -- ™89, it was ™33, so wh
at was he?  11 and 33 is 44 years old. 

Q: Right, so he was a bit olde
r. They didn™t have children? 
A: No, obviously that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- helped a lot. And he was like a 
second father to me , he was wonderful. 
Q: Really? 

A: He just -- they took me  to their heart. Now,
 my aunt of course, that™s fa mily. But he a 

stranger. That™s very -- the most wonderful ma n I ever me t. 

Q: So he touched you a lo
t. He [indecipherable] you. 

A: Oh [indecipherable] fantastic. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Fantastic, I mean, you know. And I 
lived with them for five years.  
Q: Right. That™s a long time. 

A: Passed by very quickly. 

Q: Right. But it was good for you there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
17 
 
 
A: Oh, fantastic. 
Q: And you went to school? 

A: Yeah, there I went through what they
 call in Fr ance this -- are we taping? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: In France they call it lycée, in Germany it™s gymnasium. 

Q: Right. 

A: Okay?  So they put me  in this sixth degree.
 You come s -- like I sa
y again, you start like in 
gramma r school, and you wind up, you 
know, with your baccalaureate. 
Q: Right. 

A: So they put me  back one year due to the 
language, but within three mo nths I rattled off 
French, with the proper accent a
nd things like that. We ll, I wa
s only 11, so you catch on real 
quick. And as a ma tter of fact, even if I didn™
t understand everything, I 
reme mber one day -- the 
education is a little different in France than it is
 here. It ™s mainly the ar
ts and history and such, 
not how to make a dollar. Over here it™s mu
ch more sensible. They teach you economics and 

things like that. In France, no. 
Ancient history and things like 
that. Some poetry. So I reme mber 
Aesop™s Fables, they were all translated into 
French in a big book by Mr
. LaFountaine and they 
were pretty strict in school, so 
we have to learn a fable per session, 
whatever it was. So I rehearse 
with my unc le. So I rattled off that whole fable,
 perfect intonation, stop,go, whatever. My en -- 
my uncle looked at me  and he said, do you know what
 you say?  I says no. It 
was so perfect, but I 
didn't know what I -- what I really was saying, 
you know?  The thi 
-- that™s when you™re a child, 
you mi mi c anything, and I did fantasti
c. Of course, later on I have to [indecipherable] same  thing 
with ma thematics. They used to throw number
s at you, multipliclati -- multiplication, addition, 
substraction, a teacher went like this, like th
at, picked you and you better be on the ball. There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
18 
 
 
was no mi ssing. That™s how come  
you didn™t need a calculator at
 the time . You know what I™m 
saying?  
Q: Right. 

A: You really knew how to calculate in your h
ead. That -- these are th
e things that were 
important there. 

Q: Now your parents and brother came
 to Paris in 1934, a year after you? 
A: After me . 

Q: Right. 

A: But it took that long for my father to get all 
the permits, and to -- he wa
s still able at the time 
to take all the furniture and everything that
 they had out of Germany, plus his money. 
Q: Still he could take his money? 

A: Yeah. I don™t know how he did that, that was a 
serious piece of change. And then he went to 
Paris, but of course, the French
 had accepted a lot of Ger man Jewish refugees, also Polish for 
that ma tter. And -- but the only 
thing, there were restrictions. 
You could not start a job in a 
factory or anything like that. You had to start a 
business as it would be. So my father opened up a 
meat cutting -- meat packing business, you know? 

Q: That™s very different from wh
at he was doing in Germany, yeah? 
A: Absolutely. The thing was, some  of my moth
er™s relative™s children, th
ey were butchers. So 
he had two or three of them that did the work.My father was a businessman, he knew how to run 

a business, and he™s the one with the money, so
 he bought or rented th
e building, he bought the 
trucks, he bought the machinery and he did 
the advertising. So it 
was hard -- you got to 
understand, France is a very culina
ry country. So to break in 
to the -- like what they call 
[indecipherable] which is the wurst, sausage busine
ss and ja -- ham and things like that, it™s not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
19 
 
 
the easiest, so you have to really ma ke a good 
product. But the Germans are fabulous when it 
come s to sausages and such. So the boys were 
good, they made inroads,
 slowly. The only thing 
wrong about the whole situation was there were 
young boys. In the early 30™s in France, ™34 - 
™35 - ™36, everybody flocked to Paris. Am
ericans, everybody, British, they loved it. 
[indecipherable]. So the boys di
scovered the races, they discovered the wome n, and they 
discovered gambling. Now, they we
re drawing a fairly decent sa
lary, but that wasn™t enough for 
the lifestyle. So what they did, unbeknownst to 
my father, obviously, they
 looked at the delivery 
schedule for the -- today. So they filled the tr
uck with all the stuff, 
and before the regular 
delivery boys could start, they went to the custom
ers and sold the stuff at a little discount. So 
when the regular discount -- ah, the regular dr
iver came along, sorry, you delivered this morning. 
So before my father found out, it 
was a little late. The business was shut there. So who was stuck 
with everything?  My father had 
to pay off the machinery, had to 
pay off the trucks, have to pay 
off everything. So whatever money you have goe
s down the sewer. And the guys, couple of 
them, disappeared to the hospitali
ty of countries such as Argen
tina. You know, a lot of these 
countries have been populated by people that were
n't totally clean in their native country, okay? 
Q: But this --  these were relatives? 

A: No. 

Q: Not these boys? 

A: Only one of them wa s 
sort of like a relative. 
Q: I see. 

A: And he had nerve, what they call in Jewish 
chutzpah, unbelievable. He
 had his -- he had the 
nerve to come  and had his clothe
s in my parent™s apartment and he used to come and visit 
occasionally, and my father wanted to kill hi m. A
nd he would have been able to do it, physically. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
20 
 
 
So my mother says, no [indeciphera
ble]. So that™s how come  he su
rvived. Now I jump  a little bit 
forward. The war is over, the guy is alive, he went
 back to Pa ris -- he was hiding in the south of 
France, he was -- went back to Paris, opened up 
the same  business, and he had the nerve to use 
my father™s trade name  for his own business. 
But being that nobody was cheating him,  he went 
to be very, very successful. I me t him after the war, also. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did you -- when your -- your s -- you™re
 still living with your aunt and uncle for -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- for five years. You don™t go back to your parents until 1938. 

A: Ah, well -- 

Q: But you s -- but you see them? 

A: -- we visited, she -- my mother ca
me , and -- or I visited Paris, I mean. 
Q: Right. 

A: As a ma tter of fact, I reme mber I was a young 
kid, I was 11 - 12 years old, and my father -- I 
tell you, Paris was unbelievable, he used to take 
me  to nightclubs where the White Russians, who 
fled the revolutions were dancing, the Cossacks a
nd things like that, and 
the -- in Fr ance, it™s 
okay. Children 11 - 12 years old, it
™s not a problem. So I went
 to all these places, you know?  
That™s when my father still was in business, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: And then after the thing went, shall we sa
y south, I have to use euphemi s ms, he had a 
magnifi cent apartment in Paris. I think it was --  I -- I don™t reme mber the exact name, it doesn™t 

ma tter. Fantastic, ma ybe  seven rooms and things. 
Concierge, elevators, the whole bit. Couldn™t 
carry that one any more. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
21 
 
 
A: So we had to entrench some what. Not that it 
was bad, we still had a c
oncierge, and instead of 
seven rooms, we had now five rooms of -- you know, 
and things like that. So
 it wasn™t really all 
that bad, but then my fat her had to back to it --
 to this -- his original business in Paris, you know. 
Q: But he still ma de enough money so that you didn™
t have to live in a terrible circumstance, is 
that right? 
A: Oh, no [i ndecipherabl e]. Things were pretty 
decent. My fa ther worked very hard, and my 
mother took a little job. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, as a nanny to chi 
-- to -- to a child, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: Very nice people. Jewish, of course. And so
 they made ends meet. And ma -- my mother, 
food-wise, was easy to get along with. If you give 
her a pound of chocolate 
today, that™s all she 
needed. Skinny like that. 
Q: Yes. Right. 
A: It™s genes. But sh-she knew si -- how to c
ook. I used to know how to cook, too. I reme mber 
when I went to Paris after, in
 1937 to live with them, and my mo
ther was working, my  father was 
home , or came  home. My brother wa
s there. I used to ma ke French fries. In French they have 
these special things, you know, like a cont
ainer with a screen and the oil -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and it bub -- and you know exactly when to th
row the Fr ench fries -- the potatoes in, when 
they pop up to the surface, I reme mb er, I -- 
I wasn™t -- I wasn™t exactly a -- you know 
[indecipherable] as it would be, so I -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
22 
 
 
A: -- you know. So I -- and later on, 
as a ma tter of fact, I was but -- 
I went to school in Paris, and 
I used to iron. I was the -- I must have been a 
big 15 at the time , I used to iron my -- when my 
father came home , you know, we had this -- these 
two big suitcases where all the samples were 
in. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I used to refresh the -- like I say, the jabo
t, the lace creations, and I used to iron them. 15 
years old. Think about that. Amaze. 

Q: That™s pretty complicated. 

A: So that™s -- I™m telling you, I -- I was quite talented. 

Q: Right. When you mo ved back -- when -- when
 you moved back to your parent ™s pl ace -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- rather than visiting, did your brother stay 
there, or did he go now 
to the aunt and uncles? 
A: N-No, he -- he switched over, he went -- 
Q: He switched over. 
A: -- he went with my aunt and uncle. We ll, 
it™s good for them to 
have a child, you know. 
Q: Child, right, right. 

A: Of course you -- 

Q: Was it easier for your parents also
 not to have two of you at home?  
A: Yeah, yeah, well listen, he wasn™t
 ma king the money he was used to. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, and my mother had to, you know, have 
a little job, so it was easier for them. Of 
course I think they -- they sent
 some  money, mi nima l a mount s, even while I was there, to my 
aunt and uncle -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
23 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- you know, so that it wasn™t tota
l charity case, you know what I™m saying. 
Q: Do you have any idea how much your parent
s mi ssed having the two of you in the house?  

Cause it™s very different to have one
 child, rather  than the two together . 

A: No, no, no, it™s totally different, it™s totally di
fferent. I mean, my parents went through so 
much that they were very staunch and strong people
 of character. What is needed, has to be done. 
It™s no beating your breast and -- and -- and -- 
and -- and running to the shrink or anything like 
that, uh-uh. They were far 
stronger than that, you know? 
Q: What -- you™re now a-at 
an age, by 1935, you™re not a ch
ild any more. You™re now -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- 13 years old. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you get Bar Mitzvahed, by the way? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: In France? 

A: Oh that -- that -- that™s the most amazi
ng thing. I got Bar Mitvahs -- Bar Mitzvahed in 
Germany, my father™s home
town, with the rabbi. 

Q: How [indecipherable] 

A: We  went back -- we went back to Germany, 1935. 

Q: Really? 

A: Honest. We ma naged. Just things are -- you --
 you were still abe -- my aunt, my youngest aunt 
was still living in Germa ny. So was my oldest 
aunt, okay?  And my grandfather still had his 
house. My aunt sort of like hat -- she had habe
rdashery, beautiful, you know my -- see, when -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
24 
 
 
was customary when your daughters get ma rried, to 
give them a dowry. Now, three of them were 
ma rried. My youngest one -- aunt, was not. So inst
ead of a dowry, he bought her a haberdashery. 
Really fine stuff. Really. And it was in the house, the bottom. Two 
show windows, central 
entrance, you know, the whole bit. She had decorators come  and do the windows and whatnot. 
And I reme mber playing in there when I was 
a kid, I used to love 
it, you know, I -- on the 
holidays, you know, Christian holidays, people us
ed to shop for shirts, hats, [indecipherable], 
ties. I used to lo -- pla -- love 
to play with the ties. I used to 
know how to pres
ent a tie, you know, 
with the knot and things
 like that. I was a kid, and the pe
ople loved to see me  around there. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So that part was okay. And so I went bac
k, and of course I had to learn my Bar Mitzvah 
reading. I had at least a whole m
ont h to learn everything, not a year or two. And I went to the 
rabbi every day in the af
ternoon, when he had time. 
Q: So you were in Germany for a mo nt
h in 1935, or did you do this in -- 
A: Yeah. No, no, no, that was in Germany. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We  went to Germany a month before so that 
I could get the teaching to read the Torah. Which 
I had only one month, I mean, I tell you, I don™t 
know, I™m not stupid now, but I was pretty 
bright as a young ma n, or child, you know. 

Q: Now your mother stayed in France. 

A: No. 

Q: She came too? 

A: My mother went with me , sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
25 
 
 
Q: I see. So what was that like
 to be in Germany three years af
ter hit -- or  two years after Hitler 
takes over. Is it --  was it terrible?  
A: I don™t reme mber, I didn™t -- I didn™t hang out 
too much. I went from my grandfather™s place 
to the rabbi™s place and back. And the synagogue 
was still standing and there was the Jewish 
school where we eventually went because ther
e was a Jewish center
, a magnificent gothic 
cathedral, I mean like -- a -- a synagogue, excuse me
. I me a n, whoa, fantastic. Of course it was 
Conservative with the ma b -- wome n upstairs 
and the me n downstairs, a separation, you know, 
with the pulpit, this, that, what, the Torah, it
 was ma gnificent. Oak -- oak things there for 
everybody who -- who bought a -- a seat
 there, you know, like put your stuff in, your tallis, your 
-- your -- your tefillis, you know, 
the whole thing. And the [indeci
pherable] it was beautiful. And 
then there wa s the Jewish center next door, and the bottom fl oor was the Jewish school where the 

rabbi taught the various grades
 of Jewish children, from th
e community, you know?  I mean, it 
wasn™t a hundred children, you know what I™m sayi
ng, but they were -- ranged in age, let™s say, 
from -- from I -- argument-wise, from le
t™s say seven to 14 -15 ma ybe?  I don™t know. 
Q: Let me  a sk you some thing. You said earlier th
at your father had to give up his business in 
Germany -- 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- because Jews had to not have businesses. But you go back in 1935 and your aunt has a 

haberdashery and she™s Jewish. So how is that? 

A: I -- this I can™t figure. I don™
t know whether she™s -- I think sh
e was still in business. It was 
different. My father had a differe
nt kind of business, I think. And 
they had signs -- I don™t even 
think that they had signs on the stores that 
said Juden, meaning Jews. You know, you were s -- 

not supposed to buy there. Of course, the busines
s must have fallen off drastically. But there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
26 
 
 
were some  people that we ren't so diehard, 
you know what I™m saying?  In a small town 
everybody knows each other. It™s di fferent than in the big city. You know?  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So henceforth -- the house was still -- my gra
ndfather was still in the 
house. My grandmother 
had died in 19 -- no, I don™t know when she died. I wa
nt to say in -- I wa -- I think I was in Paris 

when my grandmother died. And then my grandfat
her died later, around ™39, and my aunt stayed 
with him, the single one, because she couldn™t abandon him, it -- she felt obligated.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then she ma naged, at the last mi nute, to 
get shipped to England. Of course, whatever she 
had, went. I mean, she coul
dn't take a nickel along. 

Q: But she survived. 

A: The store, the house, they took everything. 

Q: Right. But she survived. 
A: But sh-she ma naged to go -- to get to England. 
Q: Right. 

A: From the r e, eventually she -- during the wa
r actually, she transferred from England to the 
United States.  

Q: Now, are you hearing about things that are 
going on in Germany?  I me an, you™re there for a 
month, and you say pretty much you don™t know wh
at™s going on. When you go back to France, 
are -- are you reading the papers as
 a 13 - 14 year old kid, or you™re not? 
A: Yeah, sort of. You -- a-and then you hear on 
the radio, when we -- the one thing I reme mber 
was [indecipherable] Olympics, you know, with Jesse Owens. 

Q: In ™36?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
27 
 
 
A: ™36. 
Q: Right. 

A: And Hitler occupying the Rhineland. And we t
hought for sure they gonna cut him off at the 
pass. 

Q: Who was  going to cut him off?  

A: The French, they had the -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- they had the biggest army in the world. Two million people [i ndecipherable] arms . All they 

had to do is move. They moved out of the Rh
ineland, they weren't supposed to occupy the 
Rhineland, Hitler move d into the Rhine -- this 
I reme mber, and my uncl e , who was a military 
ma n, couldn™t understand that the politicians
 screw everything up, you know. Why they didn™t 
move?  Go figure.  

Q: So what did -- what did you all -- what we
re people talking about?  Were you talking with 
adults or were you talking with kids about wh
at -- what™s Germany going to do?  Once they go 
into the Rhineland, do you now think they™re goi
ng to go some place else, you think they™re going 
to stop? 

A: No. No, no, no, no, that -- it was 
a shock, as it would be -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- already. 

Q: Right. 

A: So you know, you get shocked often 
enough, it doesn™t shock you any more. 
Q: Right. So does going into Au
stria shock you?  The Germans. 
A: No, no, that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
28 
 
 
Q: No. 
A: -- that was anschluss. 

Q: Right. 

A: They™re German spe a king people and they did 
[indecipherable] Austria and then a little bit 
tricky was Czechoslova k -- I think, wa s Czechoslovakia in 1938? 

Q: It™s be fore. It™s before the anschl uss. 

A: 1938? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that was a bad one. And so by that tim
e, he was getting stronger and stronger and 
stronger. He had Austria on his si
de, he owned all of Ger many, now he had Czechoslova kia, hey, 
hey, hey, hey, we™re becomi ng a big power. A
nd everybody loves it, nobody does anything to 
him. So Hitler gotta be the ri
ght ma n, right? If you™re German. 
Q: We re you afraid? 
A: No. 
Q: You weren™t? 

A: No. 

Q: Because you didn™t think he was going 
to come west?  You didn™t think -- 

A: Not with a two million dollar army. The -- the -- ther e was a big fallacy. Again, the Maginot 

Line was the most beautiful military constr
uction ever conceived. Everythi ng was underground, 
whole towns and whatnot, with elevators, [inde
cipherable] blah, blah, blah. What was wrong 

with the Maginot Line? It was supposed to go from
 the Swiss border to the ocean. So when they 
hit Belgium,  the Belgian got bent
 out of shape. How can you do this
 to us?  I mean, I don™t invent 
this, this is fact. How can you do this 
to us?  We  fought for you in World War 
1
, and we will fi ght 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
29 
 
 
for you if World Wa r 
11
 should happen. Belgium is gonna be 
-- is gonna be a big problem for the 
Panzer divisions?  I don™t think so. So the Germans 
left  the -- the Maginot Li
ne where it was, and 
came right through Germany like an open gate. You 
see?  So what do you do?  And th -- from that 
mome nt on things got real bad. 
Q: Where y -- Harry stays with your aunt and unc
le until when?  He -- you come  in 1938 to your 

parents -- or ™37? 

A: No, no, to my parents [indecipherable] 

Q: You come to ™37. 

A: 1937, right. 

Q: Right, and he goes to
 your aunt and uncle. 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay. Now, does he return in ™38 - ™39, or what? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: He does. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Before the Germans take over France? 

A: Yeah, yeah, ™39 the Germans -- you see, fr
om the declaration of
 war o -- by France and 
England was on September -- the ul tima tum wa
s acember -- December the third. That™s ™39, 
that™s when the war was supposed to start in
 earnest, but nobody was shooting at anybody. The 
French mal -- French mo bilized, the Germans obvi
ously were mobilized, and they called it the 

funny war because nobody did anythi ng. The Germ
ans were behind the Siegfried Line, the 
French behind the Maginot Line. They figure 
ah, you know. Figure that goes on forever now. 
The British sent over Hindu troops to France. I 
reme mber, I was there. You know the ones with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
30 
 
 
the turban?  The Sikhs, you know a
nd all that?  And the French had the colonial troops and 
whatnot, and -- but didn™t cut the mustard. On
ce the Germans started rolling, that was it. 
Q: What did you think in 1939 when they attacked Poland? 
A: I didn't think 

Q: You didn™t think. 

Q: I mean, I reme mber exactly when they walked
 into Poland. Across the street from where we 
were living, which was very larg
e central area where 
all the avenues converged towards this 
area, and there was a beautiful park up there,
 and my boss and I, we
 were, you know, we went 
through the park, you know, we sat around and 
you know, and a guy comes by after lunch, and 
he™s all bent out of shape, and I said to him -- 
so he said, the Germans just invaded Poland. Then 
we ran home, we knew that -- that wasn™t good, you know? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that™s when we hung up -- hu-hung on to 
the radio to hear the ultimatum, you know, in 
later afternoon that either
 you get out of Poland, or we going to start fighting you. 
Q: Mm-hm. We have to s -- change the tape.

Q: Okay. All right, so now you hear that the Germ
ans have attacked Poland.Is this the start of 
World War 
11
 in your brain?  This is it. Do you begin to 
hear about ghettos being forme d in ger -- 
in Poland? Nothing?  No. 
A: The following morning at five o™clock, my fa
ther put my brother and me on the train to 
Brittany, out of Paris because everybody thought 
the Germans were going to bomb Par i s, which 
they never did, obviously. And what was in Britta
ny, my aunt, while my uncle, being a soldier, 
was on the front. She was alone, so she took a vaca
tion in Brittany on the co
ast, and rented a -- 
the bottom floor of a house. So my 
father called her, she was, send 
them over, so we went there, 
and stayed in Brittany for a f-few mo nths, you know
?  It was still -- the we
ather was still nice.  
Q: And your mother and father rema in in Paris? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And whe n do you meet up again?  After th
e Germans come  in and occupy France? 
A: Yeah. I -- the first time I saw my parents was on April 12
th
, 1941. 
Q: 1941?  That means after you have 
been in at least one camp?   
A: Oh yeah -- 

Q: Or two -- 

A: -- ha -- ha -- at least three camps. 

Q: -- si -- at -- at least three 
camps. So from Brittany, after th
at, and your brother doesn™t see 
parents either? 

A: My brother went back to
 live with my parents.  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: But he was younger than me , see, it™s a ma tter of age, see?

Q: All right, so in ™39, you™re sent -- both of 
you were sent to Brittany. 
Wi thin a few months he 
goes back to Paris and you 
stay in Br ittany?  Okay. 
A: No. 
Q: No?  

A: I went to Le Mans. My aunt -- 

Q: Another aunt? 

A: No, the same  aunt. 

Q: Okay. 

A: That had rented 
the house in Brittany. 
Q: Right. 

A: Rented now a house in Le Mans. Y
ou know Le Mans?  Car races 24 hours. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Also beautiful town. There™s so ma ny nice to
wns in France, I™ll tell you. Anywa y, and -- so 
for a little while, I used to hang around 
as the word goes, I didn™t do anything. 
Q: Right. 

A: So eventually they had to put me  back into
 school, around -- before Christma s, ™39. My uncle, 

of course, was on the front and I was keeping my aunt company. 

Q: Now this is the or iginal aunt? 

A: Yeah, from -- from -- from France. 

Q: From -- from [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, so that we -- 

Q: You [indecipherable] 

A: -- don™t change aunts -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
33 
 
 
Q: Okay, this is the same  person? 
A: -- this -- this -- always the same  aunt. 

Q: Okay. And you™re now 15 years old? 

A: No, no -- 

Q: You™re 16 -- 

A: -- I™m 17. 

Q: -- 17. Okay, so you™re an old guy already.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah, okay, so you™re 17. 

A: So -- 

Q: So you™re with Emma? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. 
A: Now, being that I went to schoo
l in Le Mans previous, before I 
went to Paris, right?  From ™35 
when we left Rennes, we went
 to Le Mans until ™37 -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- when my uncle got transfe
rred from Le Mans to Veldun. 
Q: Okay, so now you™re back. 

A: Then -- now I™m back and I had two real goo
d friends who we went to school together, we 
were inseparable, right?  So I used to meet 
the m every evening, you know. One of them worked 
for a newspaper. The other one decided to become a salesman in a very high fashion fema le or 

ladies™ shoe store. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
34 
 
 
A: He was handsome, bi -- was tall, very handsom
e guy. He just was in the right business, if you 
know what I mean. And so we me
t every evening after they were finished working. We had a 
gay old time , I mean, the th -- the thr
ee of us together like nothing happened. 
Q: In spite of the fact that your country is occupied? 
A: No, it™s not occupied yet. 

Q: No, this i -- this is ™39, this is not occupied yet. 

A: Thirt -- no, no, si -- the Germ
ans s t arted running through the [indecipherable] countries in 
May 1940. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they hit France big time in -- you know,I™m not dead on the dates, but I would say 

around June 20
th
 or so, the French signed the armi stice. By that time the Germans had rolled up 
whatever was left of the French army, horse
 and buggy types. You know what I™m saying? 
Q: But before that, so you™re with yo
ur three friends having a -- a good old time? 
A: They -- they -- they nailed me  when the Ge
rmans started invading [i
ndecipherable] countries 
in 1940, in May -- May 20-some thing or other. 
Towards the end of May, I think. And they 
rounded up everybody of Ger man origin. Now, I was a German origin. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Jewish didn™t come  into consideration. They didn™t know. You know what I me an? 

Q: They didn™t know. They didn™t know. 

A: The French don™t ma ke you wear a st
ar. That™s Germans, you know. So -- 
Q: Did anybody ask you if you were Jewish? 

A: No. 

Q: It™s not on the record anywhere? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
35 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: No. Oka y. 

A: You were ec -- you™re in France, you speak
 French like a Frenchma n, you act like a 
Frenchma n, you expected to be Catholic in a 99 
percent Catholic countr
y. Very simple. You 
know what I™m saying?  So, they rounded us up, 
together with what 
I would call the real 
Germans, Aryans that were caught. It™s called 
the fifth column. You heard about the fi fth column 
in the Spanish civil war, where they put civilians 
to infiltrate a place, and 
then they take over the 
place. You know, so they had the same  thing in 
France and the French actually di d ma ke German 
prisoners.  

Q: Right. 

A: And they happened to be -- we happened to be concentrated, or quartered in a military base in 

Le Mans. So we -- there we are, the Germans 
in the German uniform. The German Nazi type 
civilians, plus a whole bunch of Jews, too. 
So we™re all together. I mean, the masses -- 
Q: This is -- 

A: -- soon found out we were Jewish, but the so
ldiers weren™t up -- you see, there™s a big 
difference be tween the Nazis and the German army. 
The German ar my is n™t as bad as the Nazis. 
Q: But how did they find out you™re Jewish? 

A: Listen, nothing stays secret for long, okay? 

Q: Yeah, but who is te -- do you know how they find out? 

A: Who knows?  I have no idea. I don™t even know. 
I -- I assume  they found out we were Jewish.  
Q: So at first you™re taken because you™re from Germany? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So -- so the German refugees into France -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
36 
 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: -- get taken? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: My assumption is that most of th
ese German refugees are Jewish -- 

A: Of course. 

Q: -- because why are they leaving Germany? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So ma ybe that™s the assumption. 

A: Who knows?  It™s hard to tell. The German so
l diers in German unifor m, there were a lot of 
flyboys there, in German uniform, t hey were hanging out by themselves, with possibly the fifth 

column types, and the Jews were hanging out with
 themselves. They were all going to associate 
with shall we call it the enemy, right? So obviously th
ere must have been a shift, or a sh-schism, 
whatever you call it. And -- 

Q: And whe r e do they put you in Le Mans? 

A: Well, I told you, we were s-stationed in a 
military base. The place was okay, we have beds 
and things like that, or cots. 

Q: So it wasn™t like a prison? 

A: No, no, it™s -- it™s a military
 camp. And then what happened, 
across the street there was the 
British military camp, and you know, [indecipherable] had a lot of British soldiers in France, you 

know. And of course, we didn™t know that. So one ni
ght, they told us to get up, pack our things 
and ma rched us out. That™s how come  we found 
out a little bit up the 
road was the British camp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
37 
 
 
But the British were -- mi ght have been gone by 
that time . And they ma rched us, and we were 
basically running away from the oncoming Germ
an army, surrounded by French soldiers. You 
know, and there was a lot of people [indecipherabl
e] like the Germans, and the German Jews, 
and everybody. It was a column of people walk
ing. How ma ny?  Don™t ask me . Hundreds, ma ybe 
more, 200, I don™t know.  
Q: But you™re surrounded by French? 

A: Surrounded by French soldiers. 

Q: Cause it™s the French [indecipherable]. Okay. 
Kurt, I™m sorry, there was a bit of a technical 
difficulty. So where we stopped was, you began to
 speak about, you were ma rched out of the 
camp and you were surrounded by French soldiers. 

A: French soldiers, yeah. 

Q: And so, repeat what happens then. 

A: We ll, then we™re walking down one of the ma in
 roads, and we™re not alone, the French were 
running away, too, and the French army was runni
ng the same way with horse, carriages, and 
things like that, dragging ma ybe
 some cannons or something, I don™
t know for sure. And all of a 
sudden, aft -- I -- I™m talking this been goi
ng on, it™s very hard walking, but few hours, you 

know, later, it™s now daytime, we started at nigh
t. All of a sudden we get a visit from German 
fighter planes that come  over and they start 
strafing us, you know, with 
bullets and things like 
that. And well, we scattered sideways and whatnot
, and then when they™re gone, we start all over 
again. Keep on ma rching, and then
 every once in a blue moon, we
 have a rest, you know, by the 
side of the road, you collapse on the grass over 
there for, you know. And didn™t have really much 
food, or anything. I had the -- I had two suitcas
es, my aunt took good car
e of me. Two large 
suitcases, one with food, one with clothing. We ll, th
at lasted about a mile or two, because 30 - 40 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
38 
 
 
pounds on each side, I -- I couldn™t walk like that fo
r long. So I took a few things out of there, a 
couple of cans of food, t ook a pajama , turned it, 
tied a knot, inside out, put it over my shoulder. 
And I put that in front of a house we were pa
ssing by around mi dnight or two in the morning, I 
don™t know, that was -- that wa
s the end of my
 possessions. 
Q: There are a lot of people leaving the north, right?  Lot of people from -- 

A: Ev-Every -- everybody was running away beca
use they knew the Germans were comi ng and 
they were getting away from the Germans. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now, the most amazing thing of it all, it was 
like the stranger than fiction. All of a sudden I 
hear my name  being called, and I turned around. A
nd who the heck is on the ma in drag, we were 

on the side?  My aunt, my brother,
 my friend and his parents, they
 were all leaving at the same  
time. I meet them in the mi ddle of nowhere, 
12 hours after we  left the camp. Do you believe 
that?  Of course, I didn™t have much of
 a chance to say hello and hug them -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- whatnot because the Germans, the French 
soldier says, that-a-way
 fellow, none of this. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, they were afraid I was going to get lost in the ma sses. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, but that™s the most amazing thing that 
-- think about it, the odds. There™s hundreds of 
thousands of people and all of a sudden I™m at 
the same heights as my -- my aunt, my brother 
and my friends from the -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- they were -- they were
 leaving together, you know?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
39 
 
 
Q: So they were also going?   
A: Yeah, they were going south, yeah.  

Q: We re they -- were they walking, 
or they had a car?  Do you reme mber? 
A: Tell you the truth, I really don™t
 know what. I don™t think they have a car. We ll, they -- they 
must have had some thing, you know.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because they mo- moving faster than we we
re, so they must have had some thing, okay? 

Q: You took out a couple of cans of food, you must
 have been still very hungry, cause you were 
marching for a long time. 

A: Oh, but -- we ma rched for -- for several da
ys. We marched approximately, I would say, a 
good -- I -- I mean 20 mile
s a day, at least. 

Q: 20 miles a day? 

A: Yeah, at least. So we walked for three days
, must have been about 60 miles. Of course, at 
night we stayed some place, you know, whatever ho
rror pl ace they could drum up. They couldn™t 
throw us in a prison, no prison was big enough, you 
know. So they put us in a schoolyard, or a 
restaurant , or  you know, whatever was handy, coul d accommodate us cramped together. I 

reme mber the worst part was one day -- one nigh
t, found some what yo -- I would call a beds -- 
bedstand. The frame, and wires strung across, you 
know, like a -- this. And I laid on that. I mean, 
like wasn™t very comfor table, you know?  Can y
ou imagine how hard it is to lay? But you™re 

young. We ll the next thing I know, I wake up. So
me body is urinating on my feet. Wo nderful, 
I™m telling you, the l-life was great. There wasn™t -- 
he coul -- he couldn™t
 even get out because 
we were so jammed together, so he st
ood up and he urinate on my feet, hey. 

Q: And you thanked him, I™m sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
40 
 
 
A: Oh, I -- I gave a -- I -- I gave him a piece of 
my mi nd, but too late, I was wet. Of course, urine 
isn™t the worst thing. 
Q: What were your shoes like? 

A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: But did your feet hurt?  Do you reme mber that?  Wa lking that much? 

A: My feet hurt, are you kidding?  
The whole sole of my 
foot was a callus. Th
en fortunately, after 
three days of walking, they found a tr
uck and they put us on a truck. A -- 
Q: Oh, that was nice. 

A: Oh, I tell you, and the countryside was beautif
ul. That doesn™t change. I reme mber once we 
were resting, and I was against the wa ll, like 
about at least that hi
gh there, you know, sitting, 
resting against the wall. You know, 
I had a little lunch or something, a bite to eat, whatever. And 
the Germans were shelling us. And all of a sudden I hear this big explosion. And ma n, I don™t 

know how I did it. In one flash I was over 
the wall, on the other side of the wall. 
Q: We ll, this must have been a nine foot wall. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Must have been a eigh
t or nine feet wall -- 
A: Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- right?  And you we nt -- and you -- 

A: -- yeah, that™s what I™m saying. I -- I jumped ove
r that like it was -- it
 wasn™t even there.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Scares s -- does a wonderful thing for you. 
And of course I was young, 
and I had -- I hadn™t 
suffered yet, you understand? 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
41 
 
 
A: And so -- it gave me  a good scare though, but th
-that told me that th
ings weren™t exactly 
going well. So anyway, then, eventu
ally we got the truck and the 
truck brought us to a railroad 
station, and then we got put in
to cattle cars, you k
now?  Eight horses, 40 men, that™s what™s 
ma rked on the cattle cars. [speaks foreign language
 here]. That™s what they did in World Wa r 
1
. 
Q: Forty me n or eight horses. 
A: Or eight horses, right. And that
™s where they put us in these cat
tle cars, and of course we had 
a French -- two -- two French soldiers per ca
r to guard us, you know. 
And being that things 
weren™t going exactly a hundred 
percent, it was stop and go and stop and go. So we went from -- 
well, what would I call it?  Britt
any, sort of like France, Norma
ndy, all the way down to southern 
France in -- in the train, and then
 they turned around and shunted the car, and the next thing we 
knew, we™re in central Fr ance in the platea
u region. You know, there™s the mountainous region 

like 3,000 feet up. And that™s -- we have to walk
 some  more from the ma in town which was 
called Marvejols, to a little pl ace in the mount
ains, which was a sh-sheep ranch. It was called 
Malavillers. And that™s where we stopped, and th
at™s where we were going to stay. And we had 
the greatest  accommodat i on in the world. We  were 
staying in a sheep barn, and we were sleeping 

on a small layer of straw over the 
sheep dung. It was just wonderful. 
Q: Over dung? 

A: Over the sheep dung. They
 didn™t take the sh -- 
Q: Oh, sheep. 

A: -- the sh -- the dung out, they left it there. 

Q: I see. 

A: They just put some  straw over it, so that™s where we stayed. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
42 
 
 
A: Wonderful accommodations. 
Q: Did it stink? 

A: Ah, who knows?  Wh o knows?  I ca
n™t reme mb er that any more. 
Q: Now this is -- this is the Fren
ch, this is not the Germans still? 

A: No, that™s the fr -- 

Q: That™s st ill the French. 

A: -- that™s still the Fr ench, oh yeah. And we got 
f-fed very well. We  had quite a bit of freedom. 

We were in the mountains, how far can you run?  Y
ou see, even if you were -- if you were of a 
mi nd to run away, it was -- it wasn™t going to work. Here™s why. 

Q: Still, it™s interesting, isn™
t it, that you have the kind of 
freedom that i-it -- you were -- 
A: Yeah, w-w-way up in the mountains. And once 
in a blue moon on a Sunday, we went down to 
the nearest village, see what you could get, l
ittle some thing or some
thing. Huma n contact, you 
know, French people. Strangest village I ever 
saw. All the houses were
 built without windows. 
You never saw a soul. A dog occasionally, and 
a nice little brook run -- river, small brook, 
whatever, run alongside, really 
picturesque. And the houses -- w-
we went inside a few time s 
because ma de friends with the locals. And they we
re heated like -- there™s 
places like that I think 
in England, too, there™s hot spri
ngs that run underneath the houses
. It™s the most a maz ing thing 
what you can learn. I me an, not because you™re l
ooking for it, because the circumstances bring it 
out. And the people were quite ugly. Must 
have been a lot of 
intermingling, you know? 
Q: Is that why be -- because of the hot springs,
 is that why they didn™
t have windows?  You don™t 
know?  

A: I didn™t delve into this too much. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
43 
 
 
A: You know, but the -- did -- nobody did nothing to
 us, so then we saw so -- went to some  
far ms, the people were quite ni ce. Well, you s
ee, we all spoke perfect French, no accent, no 
nothing. So obviously, some  stranger come s, speaks 
in French, ah -- ah, the people up there in 
the mountain, you know. You know, we didn't look lik
e dangerous criminals, so wha -- what?  
They treated us pretty good. 
Q: So then you went back to -- 

A: Of course we went back. See, we™re -- 
ex -- e -- allow me , where were you going to go 
without papers? 

Q: I don™t know. 

A: Right. As a young ma n, you were supposed to be in
 the Fr ench army of sorts, or y -- if you 
were Germa n, you were supposed to be in the German ar my. You had no business ha-hanging 

around at a young age gallivanting in the country, you 
see?  That™s -- that™s why. And the French 
would nail everybody because you need papers. I have
 the papers yet. I mean, it™s like an 
accordion, those papers, it™s not like a nice lit
tle card like this, you know?  I mean, even in 
Germany.  
Q: So how -- 

A: So they had everything nailed down to a science, there was no place to go. 

Q: How long were you in Malavive? 

A: Malaviller s -- 

Q: Malaviller s. 

A: -- I would say, okay, the war was over, it wa
s June, right?  July, August, yeah, ma ybe two 
months. Oh, by the way, at very -- at the very
 beginning, being that th
e German Germans, you 
know, soldiers and whatnot were with us -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
44 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- the German ar mi stice commission, meani
ng colonels, majors, generals, SS, governme nt 
people, came to check out who was in the camp. So immediately the Germans, like have a 

dogtag, whatever it is, they were 
put aside and sent back to the 
Fatherlands to fight another day 
or whatever, you know?  And then all of a sudden 
we weren™t German any more, now we were 
Jews. Now we were offi cially Jews. You gotta 
understand that. We  were not with Germans any 
more, German nationals that fought for the Germ
ans, we were Germans of Ger man origin. So 
now that they took the Christian people away, a
ll of a sudden I wasn™t German any more, now I 

was a Jew, officially. So that the Germans ma de
 t he French nail the Jews. That™s how come we 
never got out from under . See, the French nailed 
us because we were of German origin. And they 
were eventually gonna screen us, and then they wa
s -- was gonna let us go. Never got to this, the 
Germans got ther e fi rst. 

Q: But there is an anti-Jewish law in Vichy, and you™re in Vichy. 
A: No, that came later. That was all the way 
at the beginning. They™re
 talking 1940, they -- -- 
they -- they barely have time to get themselv
es organized. You know, the Germans took over the 
e -- the end of June, a-and this was ri
ght then and there, so what, you know? 

Q: So are you now under German rule? 

A: No --yeah -- well, we are now under Frenchrule, doing what the Germans tell them to do, 

keep the Jews, you know, locked up. So, after a little
 while, for some  reason, they send us to a 
different camp. You know, again tr
ain, but this time we -- we pick
ed up people from all over. We  
were hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of people. 
And they™re winding up in the south of 
France, the eastern coast by the 
Mediterranean and we™re walki
ng from the railroad station 
through the town -- I don™t know how far it was. 
And then we wind up on a camp that is built on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
45 
 
 
the boards on the sand of the beach. Was a very large, long beach. And there were dozen upon 
dozens of barracks. And things were pretty prim
itive at the time. There was no running water, no 
drinking water. They hadn™t set up the food situati
on yet, and that wasn™t 
very nice. That™s the 
only time that I really fell apart, I collapsed. I 
went -- couldn™t move any more, so I fell asleep. 
And when I woke up, I was alright again, you know
, and I dealt with the situation, because I 
couldn™t -- I couldn™t handle it any more. Th
at was too much. I went catatonic. S -- 
Q: Did anyone do anything to you when -- 

A: Oh, the other people have their own tsoris
, you know. Enough problems of their own. So, then 
later on we get assigned to barracks. Now that wa
s the final insult. The barracks are just built on 
the beach sand. Which, that in itself, sleeping on 
the beach is not the worst thing in the world. 

What ma de it so bad is that just before us, they
 had stationed a regime nt 
of Senegalese soldiers, 
which is the black African conti
ngent of the French army, in those barracks. Now they were not 
too keen on what you would cal
l hygiene. They used -- 
Q: No, it™s okay. 

A: -- they used every area where you would sl
eep as a toilet. And you 
found bowel moveme nts. 
And that™s where they ma de you sleep. That really 
cuts it. Of course, on top of that, being to -- 
due to that situation, there were -- I -- of course, 
I have to say millions of fleas there, because I 
myself got bitten up so badly, it™s frightening. 
From the upper thighs to the groin, my stomach, 

up to the hips, thousands of bites. I mean you can
™t just believe this, 
it was unbelievable. The 
most beautiful setting in the world, which was he
ll. Dante™s Inferno doesn™t even come  close. 
And then, to ma ke ma tters worse 
-- eventually we got food there, the French brought you know -

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay. Where are you? What camp is this, on the beach? 
A: This is called San Cyprian, which is right ne
xt to the town of Erne, on the Mediterranean, 
close to the Spanish border. And the reason that 
the camp was there was that the Fr ench had to 
accommodat e  all the Spaniards that ran away from
 Franco when the war was over, the Spanish 
Civil war wa s over in 1939, so the French, they
 came over by the hundreds of thousands, so they 
have to put them up someplace, so that they ha
d to build barracks in a hurry. Now when I say 
barracks, which goes for any time that I mention 
a barrack, this is some thing like a wa -- one 
inch thick, you know, which is like 
three-quarters thick woods, and one layer, and covered with 

black tar paper, which is wonderful in the summe
rtime, because the bl ack reverberates the sun, 
and takes it in. So if it™s 80 degr
ees inside, it™s a hundred deg -- 
o-outside, it™s a hundred degrees 
inside, it™s wonderful. In the 
winter it doesn™t do 
anything for you, it doesn™t protect you from 
anything. So -- 
Q: So the situation there was pretty awful. 
A: Y-Yeah, yeah. We  still, even there, we still 
had quite a bit of freedom. If you asked for a pass, 
they gave you a pass to go to the near town, 
you know, and things like th
at. But the unfortunate 
thing is that being we were in such unsani
tary condition, there was 
a epidemic of typhoid, 
diphtheria, and so on and so forth. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we fortunately -- this was at the beginni
ng, the French still had stuff, we got vaccinated 
for these mi series. They da -- it took care of 
three shots, you know, we -- a week apart. The 
trouble was that they were admi nistered by 
German trained doctors and I don™t know what 
possessed the Germans, they put the vaccinati
on in your pectoral, whether you™re ma le or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
48 
 
 
fe ma le, okay?  Not nice. Hurts a lot. So the first 
one, I took it. At that tim
e I mi ght also say that 
the needles were approximately a 
good five to 10 times larger than what they are now. And of 
course, there was no such thing as AI DS, so everybody got stuck with the same  needle. So 

anyway, the first shot in, fine. A 
week later, second shot in. It hurts. And the third time, they -- 
the doctor was like this and I go lik
e that, I jerk back. So the need
le being half i
n, it zigzagged a 
lot. The doctor didn™t bat an eyelash, pulls the 
needle out. Straightens 
it out with his hand and 
then he sticks me  again. End of discussion. Of
 course, I didn™t get any of the sicknesses.  

Q: Is -- i-is -- does it surprise you now that
 you would vaccinate you?  
I mean, why are they 
doing that if they™re what -- if they™re supposed
ly not caring about who you are, or what you -- 
A: We ll, the French are very nice people. They 
are ha -- they are not 
at all like the Germans, 
they™re not out to kill you. They™re
 forced into a situation that 
was abhorrent to them. You see 
that -- that™s what people don™t understand. They 
didn™t like to do that. There was anti-Se mitism 
in France, too, mi nd you, 99 percen
t Catholic country, you know, th
at you gotta understand that 
the -- the Jews did all ba -- kinds
 of bad thing to Christ, whic
h wasn™t true, but that™s the 
preaching as it went, you know?  One of the popes in 
™96 says, hey, forget about that, but at that 
time it was still running. But the 
French really are not vicious. 
Q: But what did you know la -- in this camp, 
if you didn™t know?  Anything about the Vichy 
governme nt versus the occupied [ind
ecipherable]. You didn™t know anything? 
A: We  were -- we were -- we were -- we were
 so worried about ourselves that, you know, and 
trying to -- to ma ke a life for 
ourselves -- I mean some  guys e ven went swimmi ng in the ocean. I 
mean, you c ould swim in the ocean over there, you know?   

Q: Did you have to work at all? 

A: No, nothing, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
49 
 
 
Q: Nothing? 
A: As a ma tter of fact, come  to
 think of that, I was friends wi
th two -- I -- what
 I would call -- 
what I called at that time, elderly gentlema n, around 50. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now whe n you™re 17, 50 is like getting there, right
?  So they decided, let™s see if we can™t ge t 
a little bit better treatment, let™s vo
lunt eer to work in the offi ce -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- French office, you know, do clerical work. Th
ere -- that was their profession. So he says, 
why don™t you come  with us, oh lo -- they liked 
me . Don™t want to go into the reason why. But 
anyway -- so I tried it for a little
 bit, but I felt so lous
y and it™s so hot, and the offices weren™t air 
conditioned any better than anyt
hing else. I says, so what am 
I doing here? I™m getting treated 
the same, I eat the same stuff. Why?  So I st
opped doing that, too, you know?  But da -- that™s the 
only kind that -- th
at was voluntary.  
Q: Now, we -- 

A: I seen people die there, I reme mb er one
 young, strapping fellow about 17, six foot, 180 
pounds, got dysentery over there, right?  He was d
ead in a week. That goes to show you what 
kind of fantastic genes I had. 

Q: Did you think about escaping, si
nce there was so much freedom?  
A: Like I said to you, nobody escapes from anyplace. What do you do without papers? And 

there™ s police, civil servants, all 
over the place. You see, the Fr ench, if they didn™t want to go and 
being drafted into Germany, they had to go into so
me  sort of French service. Army, police, or 
some  like that. So they had them all over the place. There wa s nowhere to go. It never even 

occurred to me  because I had enough brains to 
realize a-and where you going?  I tried the escape

business once with my brother in 1942, February
 40 -- oh no, wait, you™re not
 there yet, okay, so 
I won™t --  we™ll keep that  for later. 
Q: How long are you in San Cyprian, how
 are you -- long are you at the beach? 
A: About two months. 

Q: Two months again? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: About two months in s -- 

A: Give or take, towards winter. 

Q: -- right, right. 

A: Then they decided, oh this is not good for 
you, the winter. We  got to bring you to a better 
place, more suited for the winter. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Okay, so back in the train and we wind up 
on the other side of France. Now we™re on the 
Atlantic side, but still by the 
Pyrenees. The [indecipherable]was called Gurs. So we wind up 
there and they got the same  kind 
of barracks, with barbed wire
 around it. Sections, they called 
them, elou. Each section was called an elou, whic
h was an island, all right?  So, had maybe 20 
barracks per, and they had letters, A, B, C, D,
 you know, and so on, so forth. So I -- I believe my 
me mory serves, I went in number H. Of course
, the only trouble was that
 the barracks were of 
the same  construction, even though we™re facing wi
nter now. Sa me  thing, black tar, once inch 
ply -- one inch wood. Now the only thing is, no Sene
galese left their deposits there. This was 
okay because  who was there before us were the 
Spanish refugees. And a few Spanish refugees 
were still left there to do maintenance wor
k, the nicest young me n you eve r  me t in your life.

Friendly, gregarious, helpful, God knows what. 
Now this time we were together with wome n. 
Not together, but the camp he
ld half women, half men. 
Q: That was not true in San Cyprian? 

A: In San -- San Cyprian, I don™t 
-- I don™t remember seeing women. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Right. So, we™re in this camp, and by that tim
e it™s the winter of 1940 and the Germans were 
very busy already, plundering France for th
e homeland, you know, the Fatherland, you know, 
whatever you had there. So by that time the food 
situation wasn™t that goo
d. Very, very mi nima l. 
It consisted of cabbage at lunchtime, boiled ca
bbage at lunchtime and boiled cabbage for dinner. 
Q: This is in Gurs, in the -- 

A: In Gurs. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Once in a -- in the mo rning you got a slice of
 bread. Now, if you excuse the expression bread, 
flour as we know it was in the mi nority in the 
mi xture. Everything else
 wa s in there. Ground 
acorns, whatever you could find. And we got a sl
ice a day. Coffee, nonexistent. Some  sort of 
brew in the morning and that was it. Boiled cab
bage at lunch, not th
e most nourishing food, and 
at dinner the same  ti me . I think once a week we 
got about -- let me  exaggerate, two ounces of 
meat. I™m exaggerating now, you know. 

Q: Did you have attacks of diarrhea 
from the cabbage?  No, you were okay? 
A: No. No, no, I was okay. I™m basically consti
pated, so you know. All right?  Even as a child. 
Q: So that served you well then, in Gurs. 

A: Whatever. So, the problem is that the latrin
es -- we™re not talking ba
throoms, we™re talking 
latrines, you know what latrines
 are, right? Okay?  In bil -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
52 
 
 
Q: Why don™t you explain, what do 
they look like in -- in Gurs? 
A: Okay. They take those big oil drums, right, 
and over each oil drum they put -- they build a 
wood fra me, all right, they throw 
a roof over it so that you™re no
t exposed to the rain from the 
top. From the s -- the back is covered, the fr
ont is open, and there™s 
a walkway, and then you -- 
whatever one of the latrines, there might be 
10 spots per, ma ybe more, I don™t know. I doubt -- I 
didn't make a business of committing that to me mor y, it wasn't  that pleasant. They weren't close 

by. Why wa s that bad?  In San Cyprian they 
were God knows how far away on the -- on the 
border of the ocean. Over here, it 
started to rain and the soil, 
which was clay, turned to mud. 
Now we had to be very careful because you sank 
in up to here, because the mud has a tendency 
to suck your shoes right off your feet. I got pictur
es to prove all that, t
oo. This is not some thing 
that I ma ke up. So it was quite unpleasant. So some ti me s -- they had ma de a little walkway, you 

know, threw some  pieces of wood over there on 
some  runners, you know? So that was already 
pretty good, but that wasn™t a
ll over, you know?  So anyway, the 
food was horrible, and they 
didn™t mi streat us. We  never had to wor -- look, 
we were so damn weak, my stomach growling 
all the time , I was hungry all the time. Whenever
 I say hungry, I mean not hey, I would like to 
eat some , I mean hungr y that you we re starving,
 okay?  And the stomach is growling, there™s 
nothing in there. So once in a blue moon we sc
rounged through garbage cans to see whether we 
could find a piece of beet, or some thing like th
at, you know?  Oh, it was very nice, very nice.  
Q: We re there a lot of kids -- boys
 your age, or were they -- 
A: Nah, nah -- 

Q: -- were they ma inly older? 

A: -- nah, I was one of the few. 

Q: You were one of the few?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
53 
 
 
A: Yeah. Most of them -- most of them were 
grown -- grown me n. As a ma tter of fac t , at one 
time, we got the survivor of 
the Saint Louis, I don™t know wh
ether you know the Saint Louis was 
that ship that left Germany, where al -- ever
ybody had cub -- Cuban visas and when they hit 
Cuba, Batista said, sorry fellows, I got your m
oney, but I don™t want you. So they shipped them 
over to the United States, and the United States said
 the same thing, so what was left over, they 
send them right back to Germany, a nd the Ge
rmans said, you see, I told you nobody wants the 
Jews. So we happened to wind up with survivors fr
om the Saint Louis. Now these were all top of 
the line people. I mean, we™re talking the inte
lligentsia, you know?  Lawy
ers, writers, movie 
producers, and whatnot. And they showed the stre
ss of the trip there. I reme mber one movie 
producer, must have been in his heydays ma ybe
 250 pounds. We ll, the reason I can say that is 
because first of all, those barracks didn™t have 
any yo -- windows. A door at one each -- a door at 
each end. And we had one bulb hanging from the 
ceiling in the mi ddle, which went on for one 

hour at night, if it™s a lot, okay?
 And so we -- at night we stri
pped to look for lice -- you know, 
lice? And tried to kill whatever you could find in
 your clothing. So I sa
w him stripped one day, 
and whatever his stomach was, was now a big fl
ap hanging there. So I 
know the situation well -- 
too good. And then it gets to be winter. 

Q: Wait -- let -- let me ask you somet hing. How 
ma ny peopl e from the Saint Louis do you think 
were in Gurs? 

A: All 900 of them. 

Q: No, they went to different countries. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: So you™re not sure? 

A: They sent them back to Germany. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
54 
 
 
Q: No, some  of them we nt to England and some  
went to Holland and some went -- they went to 
different places, they didn™t all go back to Germ
any. They stopped off at different places. So you 
-- 
A: Yeah, well, good for them because I only know about the ones that wound up in my barrack. 

Q: But do you know how ma ny that you me t, 10, 20, do you have any idea? 

A: In my ba rrack ma ybe -- I™m not
 just talking my barrack, my -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- there were 20 barracks, I didn't know what was -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in the next barrack. I 
would say about 20 of them. 
Q: But you were assumi ng that all of the 
people from the Saint Louis were there. 
A: I assume d. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: If -- if nobody wanted to accept them, well, they
 have to go -- the ship was a German ship, 
have to go back to Germany. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know. So anyway, they were very nice peopl
e, I -- I got friends la
ter on with one of the 
younger lawyers, and that™s a different story, you 
have to wait for later. But there were --- 
Q: What was it -- what were your rela
tionships like with the other people? 
A: Very nice, very good -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- very friendly. Cause they were old, young, di
dn™t ma tter, they were
 nice people. Peop -- 
Q: We re people afraid of what was going to 
happen if the Germans took over this -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
55 
 
 
A: I don™t think so, I don™t think so. 
Q: You don™t think so? 

A: I™ll tell you why, here
™s the story. Gets 
to be winter, right? 
Q: Mm. 

A: Now, I discussed the construction of the ba
rracks. Every morning when you woke up -- there 
were stalactite hanging from the ceiling, I -- I me an
 a lot. The condensation of the breath. The 
breath goes up, for m stalactites. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Right?  And then, after awhile, from southe
rn Germany, the Germans had a shipment of 
people from part of German -- it™s about ma ybe 
6,000 of them, they shipped them over to Gurs. 
Wome n, children, babies, old people. And I reme mb
er that because I was involved with them 

later on. And you know, the wintertime, the icic
les from the ceiling, every morning the door 
opened up and one of the French workers came
 and he yelled, any stiffs?  Meaning, anybody™s 
dead, frozen to death? Well, fortunately my barr
acks, we weren™t that old. But the people from 
Germany, you had the old people, and you saw -- 
well, ma ybe -- no, not necessarily, there were 
some people, older people, because I reme mber 
looking at the truck and 
all you saw sticking out 

f-from the truck were the feet with the socks 
-- with the socks on. You 
didn't see the body, they 
were covered. And we have the cemetery at th
e end of the camp, was -- the camp wa s ma ybe a 
mile long. At the em -- end of the camp was a cem
etery and they used to bury them there. And 
it™s a situation -- I™m telling you, if -- if we have 
no -- no light at all in the barracks, nothing, one 
bulb hanging in the mi ddle, ma ybe one hour at ni
ght, I™m telling you that™s all, and that™s where 

we quickly stripped, whether wi
nter or summer, didn™t ma tter,
 and looked for the lice, and 
[sound effec t ] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
56 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. Where did you eat?  
In the barrack, or outside? 
A: We ll, they -- at lunchtime they rang the 
-- you know, the bell or some thing, and you went 
there with a whatever it was,
 and you got the ladle of soup. 
Q: Where -- where -- where w
ould you go?  Wa s there -- 
A: To the kitchen. 
Q: There was a kitchen?  

A: Yeah, with the big cauldrons, you know? 

Q: So -- 

A: I once volunteered to work there, too. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: [indecipherable] my reward was 
to get up at four in the morni
ng, start the fire, and I could eat 
as much cabbage as I wanted. A
nd that didn™t 
cut it either.  
Q: So, everybody in the camp went to one
 kitchen, or was there a kitchen -- 
A: No, no, no, every -- 

Q: -- every section has -- 

A: -- every section, every -- 

Q: Island? 

A: -- island had its own kitchen. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. So that was it.  

Q: Did you work there? Was there work indoors?  

A: Later on, later on. I dis -- 

Q: But not this fi rst time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
57 
 
 
A: N-Not at -- not at the begi
nning. It ca -- really 
start to get to me , freezing and whatnot. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So the same  guys that I me ntioned before, volunteered to work in the office. 

Q: Is this Charles, one of the people?  Is th
at his name ?  Or is that not his real name ? 
A: No, one of them was  George. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I can look it up to get the real name , and Abrams , I think his name  wa s Mr. Abrams , they 

were bookkeepers. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: I said ah [indecipherable] 
let™s go the office, at least it was heated. They had the same  
barracks mi nd you, but they were much better with
 doors and things like 
that, and it was heated. 
So that was great. The food was the 
same . We  st ill ha d to go back -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and we had to go back to sleep. 
Q: Right. 

A: But during the day at least you got to eat. 

Q: So that™s good. 

A: And you ma de friends. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, the police inspectors 
that were there, they were ve
ry nice. They were very nice. 
Nobody mi streated you, I tell you. So after a little while, there was one plum job to be had. That 

was working for the director of the camp in the 
head barrack. So the guy was one of the Spanish 
Civil Wa r refugees, and he had the [indecipherable]
. Very nice fellow, but he got a little greedy. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
58 
 
 
He got into problems, so they dumpe d him. And 
I heard about that, I says, that™s my job. So I 
went and [indecipherable] he didn™t speak French 
as perfectly as I did. I 
went there, I impressed 
them no a -- no end, you know. Wa s him and the -- his 
assistant. I was hired on the spot. So now 
I™m living in splendor. There is -- you -- look at 
the barrack, the -- they have the same  barrack. 
The only difference is, picture a railroad car, and o
ffices to either side with doors. And he has the 
whole back end of the barrack, the director, 
right?  He lived on camp, as it would be, or on 
campus, what -- however you want to put it. He
 had a beautiful house a little away from 
everything else, big villa, you know, with his wi
fe, two kids. And so we had also what you 

would call a reception room. The reception room ha
d a little window, peopl
e ask questions, then 
the door, and then part of the reception room was 
partitioned off about -- I™d say about three feet. 
A wall, with a curtain. There was a bed in there. Luxury unlimited as far as I™m concerned. I 

didn™t have a bed before. Like a regular cot, 
you know?  And I -- whatever 
I had, th-th-the three 
pieces of clot hing I could hang up, whatever. 
Wa s three feet by ma ybe eight feet. Luxury 
unlimited, and it was separated from the reception ar
ea. And I dealt with the inspectors, I dealt 
with the radio operator, I dealt wi
th the boss, I del -- I dealt with 
his assistant. So they ma de me  
do jobs, you know, like little jobs and things like
 that. But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big 
time. So the most amazing thing is that -- of cour
se there was no gasoline to be had in France, so 
the French invented cars that -- the regular cars were converted to 
run on charcoal gas. They had 
those big cylinders mounted in the back of thei
r car, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit 
it and that created gas and that 
went through a tubing to some  sort
 of fuel indi -- gas injector. 
And you we ren't ri -- winning any races with it, bu
t you could at least do 25 miles an hour with 
that, flat of course, you know. So th-the -- th-t
he Germans we re even smarter than that, they 
invent -- they were so -- so br
illiant, they invented some thing, they had two cylinders on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
59 
 
 
trucks, one on this side, one on 
that side. And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mi nd 
you. You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that 
cylinder, that transfor
m it into charcoal, send 
it over to that cylinder, and th
at™s how the trucks worked. Imean, you -- you gotta give them 
credit. You don™t have to like them
, but you gotta give them credit. 
Q: Did it go faster than 25
 miles an hour?  The same. 
A: Like I said, you were -- y-you won™t win races, okay? 
Q: How long were you in Gurs at this time, the first time ? 

A: Okay. Tell you, I got out of there on April 12
th
, 1941. I got there ma ybe October ™40. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So the fi rst time was what, 
seven months?  No, six months.  
Q: Now doe s your father have some thi
ng to do with your leaving some how? 

A: Yeah. Now, my parents were in Pa ris, so
 when situation went bad, the Fr-French rounded 
them up too, in the [indecipherable], which was a bi
g stadium in Paris. The wome n we re sent to 
one camp. My mother happened to be, 
coincidently be sent to Gurs. 
Q: But you didn™t know. 

A: No. 

Q: But you were there the same  time? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: And my father was sent to another camp, a
nd I don™t reme mber exactly the name . So, after 
they get screened, with references and things like
 that, they saw they were totally harmless, they 
let them go. But, they were assigne
d residents, forced residents. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
60 
 
 
A: And the forced residents was in so me  mi nor, 
small village in southern France, you know? So 
that™s where my mother and my f-father wound 
up. And my mother heard on the rumor mill that 
I was comi ng from San Cyprian, so for weeks sh
e didn™t eat her bread and was keeping it for me , 
so that I should have enough food. 
Q: She heard that you we re comi ng to Gurs? 

A: Uh-huh. The rumor mill is fabulous. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And she was saving the bread for me , you know, 
the rest, I mean the -- the cabbage she can™t 
save, you know?  My mother didn™t look too heavy, either. 

Q: So, did you get this bread? 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t -- you had no 
idea that she was there. 
A: I found out -- 
Q: Much later, uh-huh. 
A: -- once -- once I joined them in Castelno -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you know.

Q: Kurt, can you explain what forced resi
dence is?  You said that your parents -- 
A: Right. Well, the same  applied for me  and my
 brother. When you are released from the camp 
with all the proper papers and whatnot, you™re assi
gned to live in a certain 
area. Now, first thing 
you do, you present yourself at the 
police station, and the police 
station ho -- te
lls you at the 
police, whoever it is, tells you how of
ten they want to see you a week. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You have to check in with them to ma ke su
re that you™re still there.
 You see they usually -- 
villages don™t have a -- you know, 
even -- even in towns doesn™t ma tter, they cannot be with you 
24 hours a day. They want to ma ke sure that you 
don™t escape or run away, or do some thing that 
you™re not allowed to. So anytime you want to go, 
or you have to go to let™s say the nearby town, 
you have to go up to police departme nt and ask them
 for a pass. So that™s what forced residence 
is, that you check in with them all the time. Can™t move from t here. 
Q: Now, wa s your father in Vern
ette?  Is that where he was? 
A: Le Vernai. 
Q: Vernai? 

A: I think that™s what it was. 

Q: So both he and your mother, who had b
een taken to two different places -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- were -- were released? 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And they went to the sm
all, little village called? 
A: Castelnot Rivierbas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
62 
 
 
Q: Right. Now, they were both sent there on 
purpose cause they knew they were husband and 
wife, or no? 
A: Oh yeah, no, no. Somehow my fat her, who is a 
very bright ma n, mi ght 
have gotten in touch, 
through some organization or whatnot, 
to find out where my  mother was. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And that™s how they got together and w
ound up in Castelnot at the same  time. I never 
questioned it because we had other worries at the time -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- you know, how. I know where and when, but 
not exactly, you know, how they got together.  
Q: Got together, right. Now, how do you end up there? 

A: Where? In Castelnot? Oh, when it came ti me fo
r me to be released --this was the strangest 
thing, my fa ther, who is an alien resident -- alie
n resident, actually, what
ever you call it, is now 
pretty much an unwanted person, right?  We nt 
to see the ma yor, the governor, whatnot. Got an 
audience and pleaded my release with them. And then they gave him a pass to come and see the 
commandant of the camp where I was, showed him the goods, and that™s how come  I got 

released. Can you imagine my father, who -- who 
-- who had -- who had no standing whatsoever, 
ma naged to do all that?  Of course, when they rel
eased me , we are to Castelnot Rivierbas. Why?  

My father, mother lived there, si mple. 

Q: Now whe r e is Harry at this time? 

A: Harry was already in ca 
-- in Castelnot Rivierbas. 
Q: Had he been put into a camp also? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
63 
 
 
A: He was too young. 
Q: So it was only people over 17, or
 Germans over se -- was -- cau
se you -- you were the sort of 
the line -- 

A: I -- I just  lucked 
out, what can I tell you? 

Q: Right. So when you go back, when you go there,
 you™re with your father and your mother and 
your brother, and your aunt is where?  Where™s Emma?  

A: My aunt came to live, after a 
little while, came to live with us. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because she couldn™t stay where she 
was, was the occupied zone, reme mber? 
Q: Right. So she couldn™t stay. 

A: When the Germans decided that
 they™re going -- I -- I mean, befo
re they decided to take all 
over France, at -- at beginning sh
e -- she got along pretty good 
with the Germans, because the 
Germans respect each others Army officers, things
 like that. So being she was the wife was -- of 
an Army officer, you know -- 

Q: And whe r e was her husband, do you know? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Or -- your uncle? 

A: When the war was over, he was prisoner of war in Germany.  

Q: So that™s where he was the whole time , so -- 

A: No, not the whole time . Af
ter -- after about a year or
 so they released him.  
Q: And he came to where you -- you were?  Do
 you -- or you don™t know, because by then you 
were gone?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
64 
 
 
A: You know, this is a little hazy
 in my mi nd. I reme mber my a
unt living with us. You gotta 
realize, my parents had rented a sma ll, little
 house. It had a kitchen, and two rooms. A living 
room and a bedroom, so the living room was tran
sfor me d into a three pe
ople bedroom, my -- my  
aunt, my brother and me  -- when she came. That was -- they were small rooms anyway. And so 
eventually my uncle was released and then -- by 
that time they made him a general because the 
job asked for it. The -- he  was in charge of 
the medical military, I gue
ss, otherwise too, I don™t 
know, of the hospital, or hospital with an 
s in Vichy, Vichy, France, you know, where the 
governme nt was? 

Q: Right. 

A: And he ma naged to -- to do in his position, to do a lot of good to save some  Frenc h soldiers 

from, you know, unpleasantnesses.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know. 
Q: So ho -- what do you do when you go to this little village? 
A: Huh?  

Q: What do you do when you go to this little village? 

A: We ll, originally I couldn™t work. So the only 
job open was as a farm ha nd. So, I got a job as a 
far m hand. But the funniest thing is, for the first 
-- it sounds strange -- 40 days, I couldn™t go to 
work. Why?  The Bible repeated itself, we ha
d 40 days of rain. I™m not kidding you. The only 
difference was, some times it rains heavy, and some ti me s it rains slower. Now, how c o me  not 

everything was flooded?  Because -- 
I happen to appreciate the Fren
ch, very brilliant, they had 
ditches alongside the road on either side. That™s
 where the wa ter went , and then the water went 
into the big river. Of course, th
ey also have a person with a sc
ythe, you know what a scythe is, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
65 
 
 
right, to mo ve this. This was a county job. He was 
in charge of moving the grass from the -- from 
the ditches. 
Q: So he took out the grass that -- 
that flowed in, so it wouldn™t -- 
A: N-No. 

Q: No. 

A: It can™t overgrow. They wanted 
to keep the ditches as drainage. 
Q: I see, right. 

A: In perfect condition, not to impede th
e water, with grasse s growing all over. 
Q: So for the first 40 days you can™t work? 

A: Yeah, it™s so funny, 40 days of rain. 

Q: Did you sleep a lot?  Were you exhausted 
from being in Gurs, 
or you were okay? 
A: I was ma inly s -- ma inly [indecipherable] wh
at I did, I did a lot. I 
don™t know where I got it 

from. I mended my father™s jeans, he would be
 very fashionable now, had patches all over. I 
made my mother -- 

Q: Your father was wearing jeans then? 

A: Oh, the jeans are inve nted in Fr ance.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The Nimes. Da Nime s. Nime s being southern
 France. That™s where the name  come s from. 
And these were working pants for -- for when 
you work. You couldn™t wear a suit. And all the 
way at the beginning too, I did some thing else. I --
 my father got into a 
deal with some  of the 
far mers, to cut their hedges and some  of the tree
s. So my father was at 
the time  [indecipherable] 
57 years old. And so we went there, and in excha
nge of what he did, he got half the wood that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
66 
 
 
cut down, because we ha d the wood stove, and that
™s the only thing that worked, my mother 
cooked on the wood stove. So we had heat in th
e winter. I did that at
 the beginning, right.  
Q: So let me  ask you some thing, you™re now 
20 years old, right?  19 -- 
you™re born in -- 
A: Not yet, not yet, I™m only 19.  
Q: I thought we were -- 

A: ‚22 

Q: -- we™re in 19 -- 

A: ™22 - ™41. 

Q: All right, we
™re in ™41, okay. 
A: I™m not going to be -- I™m not even going to be  21, because right now we™re in April 12
th
, 
1941. 

Q: We have to wait til August. 

A: You have to wait four months. 
Q: Right, okay, forget [indecipherable] forg
et my question. So how long do you do the farm 
work? 
A: We ll, fa rm work fr om let™s sa y, yeah it was th
e summer. June ™41 til g
eez, when did they lock 
-- lock us up again?  August ™42. Yeah, August 
™42, when they round -- th
ey -- they round -- the 
police rounded us up again, put us on truck 
and back to Gurs for deportation purposes.  

Q: Right, right. Now, you have one or
 two relationships with young girls? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You have some  dates? 

A: Hm?  

Q: You have some  dates, or you have -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
67 
 
 
A: Oh, we -- well, I -- the one that I -- that™s a 
very strange story. Like ag
ain, I said like truth is 
stranger than fiction. Did you hear of Lourdes in
 your life, Lourdes, holy place, the Virgin, da 
da?  Anyway, the train from [indecipherable] Sainte 
Marie wa s close by Gurs to my parents, goes 
from -- to Pau and then Tarbes. Tarbes is the bi
g center, and the local tr
ain from my parent™s 
place, Castelnot and further up, comes there twice 
a day, once in the morning and once at ni ght. 
Re me mber, it™s war time . So I™m sitting in this
 big -- you -- you know what the European rail 
station look like?  They™re like 
all glass, you know, tremendous
 ceilings and whatnot, you know?  
And I™m sitting ther e, you have to wait for my train, I -- I got there li --  let™s say 10 - 11 in the 
morning, or 12, and my t r ain is at
 four  or five in the afternoon
, right? So I™m sitting on the bench, 
waiting, looking around, nothing is happeni
ng. Tr-Train pulls in, and down yonder 
[indecipherable] I see two ladies. I says, oh, it ca
n™t be, it™s my  mother and my aunt. I says no, 
you™re hallucinating. And as they come  closer, lo
 and behold it™s my mo ther and my aunt. Now 
my father knew I was going to get released that
 day, it was a Sunday, Easter Sunday. My mother 
and aunt had left before the me ssage got to 
them, and they decided [indecipherable] for my 
uncle, who was Christian decided, let™s go to Pau,
 couldn™t hurt. Everybody else goes there for a 

mi racle. Ah, what else we  got to do?  So they took
 the train to Pau, and then to Lourdes. And they 
got off the train from Lourdes beca
use they had to change it at Tarbes, same  that I did, and ma n 
was that emotional. Totally -- I™m -- I™m telling 
you, truth is stranger th
an fiction, there™s my 
mother and my aunt in the same  station, the da
y I got released from the camp. Okay, fine. Now, 
how did I know -- get to know this little girl? We
™ r e waiting for the train, go into a compartment 
and then three people come  in
 the compartment, a ma n around 50, woma n around 28, and a real 
nice looking young lady around 17 - 18. Looks interesti
ng, okay. The weirdest thing is they get 

up at the -- get off at the same  station we did. My
 mother happened to know them, which she told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
68 
 
 
me  later, blah, blah, blah. They were Belgian. 
The f -- the husband must have been very rich 
because he bought the local castle, chateau, okay?  
And they also sold some  dairy pr oducts. So 
the following morning my mother says, look, why 
don™t you go up the road th
ere and see -- try to 
get a few eggs, ma ybe s o me thing else, cottage cheese, whatever. I don™t reme mber what. So I go 
there, and there™s a big gate a
nd two Dobermans, black things. No -- was never too fond of dogs, 
ever since I was bitten at the 
ripe old age of 11 by a dog to whom
 I didn™t do anything. So I was 
ah -- but fortunately they di
dn™t do anything to me . So, you know
, a castle, big driveway, you 
know, circular driveway. So I walk on to the side 
entrance there, and that™s where they used to 
sell stuff from. Th-Th-They were cultivating the farm, they were using the far m. And who is 

there? This ma gnificent creature. 
So now, I never lose time  beati
ng a dead horse. No, I knew this 
was going to work. I ask her, would she like to 
have a date, you know, some thing like that. So 

she says, I have to ask my -- whoever it was. Couldn™t have been her mother. At 28 you don™t 

have an 18 year old kid, I don™t care what ag
e you start. Relative, some body, [indecipherable] 
brother-in-law, so [indecipherable] so the la
dy says, you sure don™t waste any time. You know, 
says [indecipherable] so I picked her up on Sunda
y, and we hit it off pretty good, but it didn™t 

last too long because after awhile the ma n of 
the house, who was 50, realized hey, what™s this 
foreigner doing with my whoever it is, shall we sa
y protégée? Gets better. And I couldn't  see her 
any more. So they locked the door, they locked 
the gates when I was supposed to pick her up. 

And his forema n was a big dude about six three or
 four. He says to me , you know, I like you, but 
if you know what™s good for you, desi
st. Cease and desist. So I can 
take a hint. Funniest thing is 
one day while I was waiting for my - -  let™s say gi
rlfriend to get ready, the lady of the house says, 
gee, would you like to see the place?  Now you gotta
 understand one thing. This is not the United 
States. The United States I would have been shall we
 say a little more up to date and not as naïve 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
69 
 
 
as I was, okay?  I was -- you know, I was not necessa
rily shy, but -- I don™t 
like to discuss things 
like that, but anyway. So she takes me  up to he
r bed-bedroom. Carpeting that high, white. Now, 
what I didn™t realize at the time is I [indecipherab
le] the spot, her for the little girl. She was going 
to get for -- go for me  in a big way. But I 
was too dumb and young. I was afraid. The husband, 
big guy, look at the co -- position I™m in, I™m
 -- I™m -- I™m -- I™m like under the gun with the 
police. All anybody has to say, I™m dead meat. Soshe got very, shall we say depressed once they 

openly got together outside, th
e husband and the young lady. You al
ways saw them together in 
the carriage, you know. You know, 
a s -- little horse carriage, 
you know, for two people. And 
she, from what the rumo r had it, she jumped 
out of the first floor balcony, you know, trying to 
kill he rsel f. Of course, she was -- she was going to ma ke sure it wasn™t  deathly. So that  was my 

story with that sweet thing. 

Q: So it didn™t work out. 

A: Well -- 
Q: Exactly. 
A: First of all, I didn™t have -- had sex at my ripe old age because I spent most of my t i me  in 

places like Gurs etcetera, etcetera
. And the war got in between a 
lot of things and the reason I 
didn™t have sex is because A, I didn't have sex. 
So I said to myself, what if you don™t do it right, 

and the lady isn™t happy with your efforts?  
You know, that was my thinking. I was always 

thinking about some body else, never about 
myself. You know, most people think about 
themselves, hey, I want to get laid, amen. So
rry about the language, but you know, that wasn™t 
me, I just --  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- I did -- I did that twice, li
ke a schmuck, but later on I caught on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
70 
 
 
Q: So are you, before you are captured again and taken away -- 
A: I was [indecipherable] 

Q: -- you™re doing far -- you™re doing 
this farm work the whole time ?  
A: Yeah, oh -- only 16 hours a day. 

Q: That™s all? 

A: They actually want -- wanted me  on Sunday 
too, but I says, uh-uh. I c -- I could barely move. 
The first thing I did for six weeks, they gave
 me  a hoe and I hoe the vineyard. Now, you know, 
vineyard is not from her e  to th
e door. How ma ny rows there are 
in a vineyard?  I was -- my back 
bent to the sun, I had to take shirt off, didn™t ha
ve -- I didn't even have money for a hat, wa -- had 
no money. You know what they paid 
me at -- let -- let™s not exaggera
te. I think they paid me at 
the current exchange rate, 25 cents a day. 1941, okay?   

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Even that wasn™t a lot of money, e ven in 1941. The only thing is, they fed me . What they feed 
me  morning, noon and lunch was, considering my 
gall bladder, not the right thing. Pure, white 
lard for breakfast. You know what 
that does to your in-intest -- ga
ll bladder and liver?  That was 
my breakfast, huh?  Not bacon, bacon 
has -- got half -- half
 meat in there. Pure, white lard. We ll, 
they didn™t have that muc h to themselves 
because the Germans took 
all their cattle out, you 
know. So the only thing that left
 was pork and geese, you know, the geese that you fatten?  So -- 
Q: What -- what do you hear now about what™s 
going on in the east, because now Germany has 
attacked Russia, and they™re starting to ki
ll Jews, as well as some  other people. 
A: Who doe s? 
Q: The Germans.  

A: Oh -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
71 
 
 
Q: In 1941, do you hear anything? 
A: No, not a word. We  knew through the grapevin
e that there were camps 
and things like that, 
but we don™t know exactly what. There was Dachau 
what -- that was in Germany, Buchenwald is 

Germany, a nd there was a couple other ones right in Germany. 

Q: No, I™m t a lking about -- I™m talking about Poland now. 

A: Yeah, I know. We ll, Poland -- 

Q: But you don™t hear. 

A: -- we didn't  know from yet. It™s when they st
arted trying to de-deport us in Gurs. That™s when 
we knew it -- Auschwitz. 

Q: Which is later, ri ght? 

A: Well, you see, we met with a lo
t of Jews from various areas -- 
Q: Who told you. 

A: -- and they had good intelligence, you know. 
Q: So how do you get captured, why do you get ca
ptured in ™43, I believe? You™ve been -- 
A: Now ™42 -- 

Q: -- two -- 

A: -- I got released after 
months. Being that I was -- I told you 
I worked for the chief of the camp 
-- 

Q: Mm. 

A: -- and all his police in
spectors were my buddie s . So when we came there they were sitting at 
the table, and they, you know, took your name  and 
everything like that, and my brother. So 
obviously I never showed 
up on the deportation list. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
72 
 
 
A: My pals, right, I™ll tell -- 
I™ve -- I™ll tell you, it paid off, 
that one time  I worked. And you 
know how good the French were, and how good the pe
ople we re at that time over there?  They let 
us keep our pocket knives. They weren™t afraid
 that they [indecipherable]. Can you imagine you 
go to -- you put a prisoner in one of the prisons 
here, and you let him have a nice pocket knife?  
That™s -- that wa -- just what
 they™re looking -- I™m telling you, 
was different times and different 
people. 
Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. We re you afraid about being deported? 

A: Well, I wasn™t exactly thrilled. 

Q: All right, what did you think?  Did you 
know anything at that point in ™41?  Wa  
[indecipherable] 

A: Well ha -- I -- I knew I™m as good 
as dead if I get on the train, okay? 
Q: That™s what you knew? 

A: Yeah, that much we knew. 
Q: But you didn™t know how or why or where. 
A: No, Auschwitz we knew. 

Q: No, forget why. You knew Auschwitz. 

A: We knew Auschwitz, the 
train was for Auschwitz.  
Q: What year do you think that is, ™42? 

A: The first year was ™42 in August. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they needed 5,000 people. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
73 
 
 
A: And the few Jews they had left, they -- they we
re so efficient, they collected them all, there 
were more than 5,000, because there were a fe
w left over, including my brother and me, you 
know. 
Q: So after that first 
month, you get released -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and then you™re -- they you -- 

A: Go back to Castelnot -- 

Q: -- then you get -- right. 

A: -- go back to work on the farm. 

Q: Right. And then the police come to try to 
get you again, and you and Ha
rry try to escape. And 
you ma ke it until what? 

A: We ll, okay. We  were prepared this time, we said -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- next time  we jump  out the window, th
e side window. We had a 
little suitcase, you know, 
each and every one of us, put some  food in there, 
whatnot, and we™ll try to make it to a different 
town and get on the railroad and try our luck go
ing that-a-way, which is stupid, but when you™re 
young, you™re stupid. 
Q: Which was that-a-way?  Which way is
 -- which way were you going to go? 
A: Towards central France. 

Q: To central France. 

A: Central central. Not just east or we st, but 
halfway between north and south and the ma ssive 
centrale, we had -- 

Q: But still in Vichy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
74 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah, right, okay. 

A: So we made it through a few fields, the farmers 
looked at us a little st
range, and the next thing 
you know, who is waiting for us?  One of the local 
cops. On bicycle, as we were crossing the 
road. So he said to us, how can you do this to me
?  I says, excuse me ?  He was insulted that we 
run away because that puts a bad -- it puts him 
in a bad light. And that™s
 when my pa rents left 
Castelnot because they knew. 
They™re down on us now, you know?  Now, I had that one time, we 
had some  friends by the name  of Rot hchild, whic
h Rothchild also denotes serious deniros, you 
know?  And they had the son, one and only son. They liv
ed in the nearby village, also residents. 
And the son tried to ma ke it to Spain. We ll, he 
paid big money to some  of t he what do you call it, 
guides, and the guides --  

Q: No, wait, let™s stop for -- let™s stop
 for a mi nute. Okay?  Sorry, he™s choking. 
A: Okay, so they had a son, and he paid some
body big bucks to get him out of France over the 
mountains. Well the guy took it from both sides.
 Took his money, took the German™s money and 
that was the last time you heard from hi m. So 
you know, money isn™t the 
answer to everything. 
But, what they did for us, they ma naged to get 
authentic, blank false papers. Okay, blank. So like 
I said, I don™t know, I saw in retrospect, I™m a ma zed
 at myself how talented I was. I ma naged to 
forge those papers so efficiently, I forged the 
ma yor of the village™s ha
ndwriting that he could 
have sworn he signed it. Couldn™
t do it today any more. So my 
parents had false paper ma king 
them French people, you know. And the right 
age, right everything, you know they were, you 
know. 

Q: Where did you get the false 
papers from?  From th -- 
A: From the Rothchilds. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
75 
 
 
Q: From the Rothchilds, I see. 
A: See, they had -- they had -- 
they had more mo ney than God, 
so they could buy anything they 
wanted, you know. 

Q: And why were they willing to give you the false, bl ank -- 

A: We  were friends.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My parents and them were friends.  

Q: I see. 

A: My parents had a lot of friends, I mean -- 

Q: Okay, so y -- 

A: -- very likable people, my parents. 

Q: So you -- you got them these forged papers that you forged for them?  

A: Mm-hm, and that™s when they pssshhht. 
After they nailed us the second time. 
Q: They took you away. 

A: In August ™43. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now that time it didn™t go too good because 
I wasn™t released. Oh, I was released. I was 
released in the custody of the Germa n slave la
bor. Organizatione Tote, 
working on the Atlantic 
wall. That wa s a lot of fun. 

Q: And wha t  camp are you in when you™re doing this? 

A: La -- Labe nne. Labenne Oceane. 

Q: Labenne? 

A: Yeah, from Gurs, we di -- we were -- got
 on a train, and da da
 da da da, you know?

Q: Wa it a minute, now. We did -- we didn™t actually
 do this. In ™43, after 
you™ve released for a 
month and you go back, they you™re captured again and you go to Gurs. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Is that right? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And from Gurs -- 

A: In ™42 I was released, and then -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- re-released agai n in ™43 -- 

Q: ™43, right. 

A: -- then we  run away, then they put 
us on the truck in front of the house. 
Q: Right. And you go to Gurs. 

A: And then Gurs. There™s a little
 side story, very interesting. 
Q: All right, hold the side story for 
the next tape, cause there™s not a -- 
End of Tape Five

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: All right, so you™re
 in Gurs, you™re taken on the truck 
to Gurs. Harry is with you. Am I 
correct? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you go to Gurs, and you™re there for? 

A: Oh, as -- as long as it took to ma ke a c
onvoy, but they didn™t put me  on the convoy again, 
because like I said, when you get checked 
in, my pals were the ones that -- 
Q: Got you out. 

A: Mm-hm. Or didn™t put me on the list. 

Q: So at that point they were deporti
ng Jews to Auschwitz as far as you knew? 
A: No, that was the second time, in ™42 they depo
rted them to Auschwitz. In ™43, they fi -- the 
Germans figured there must be enough Jews left
 to ma ke another convoy. So that was ™43 in 
August. 
Q: Right. But you don™t get put on that 
and Harry doesn™t get put on that. 
A: No. 

Q: But you and Harry do not st
ay together at
 that point. 
A: No. 

Q: They separate you. 

A: Right. See, he was young yet, still younger. 

Q: He™s still younger, right. 

A: But already of age of -- 

Q: Yeah, he™s past 18 -- 

A: -- something. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
78 
 
 
Q: -- right?  You™re 40 -- you™re 21. 
A: Yeah, yeah, right, right. 

Q: So he™s past 18. 

A: ™43, I™m -- yeah, I -- I™m 21 right then on my birthday, right. 

Q: Right, August.  

A: So, what happened, after a littl
e while they segr egate us and they pick me and a few other 
guys, and they send them to the Germans 
on the Atlantic coast for slave labor.  

Q: Right. 

A: Now, we went with a truck from Gurs to La
be nne Oceane, which is the name  of t he site, and 
strange as it seems, we pass right in fr ont of
 the Lourdes Cathedral, you know, where all the 
mi racles happen?  And the truck stops dead. So we
 all have to get off the truck and push it up the 

hill until it st arts cranking again. That was ver --
 very strange things happen in life. And if you -- 
you can add meaning to it if you want to, or just 
add it to coincidences. So
 I -- personally I think 
it™s coincidence you know, but whatever. So, but 
you can ma ke things out of that, you know. 
And then I wound up with the Germans, and the 
first thing I know -- they
 show us where we 
sleep, and then they ma rch us out to the wo
rksite. Now, 5,000 people swarmi ng around there, 
okay?  They weren't Jews. We  were the only Jews, ei
ght of us. At that time 
they didn™t know it, 
too -- n-no -- no -- they™ve ra -- okay, let™s 
put it that way, not ever
ybody knew we we re Jews, 
okay?  So, they put us to work ri
ght there. I™m fa cing a mountain of
 gravel  a little bit hi gher than 
the ceiling, you know, like this is 
15 feet, let™s say 20 feet an
d a good 150 feet long. And they 
give us shovels, and we have to shovel wa
 -- I don™t remember wh
ere, mo st likely in 
wheelbarrows. And we have to shovel that thro
ughout the night. And I said to the forema n, in 
German -- German fore ma n, I says, look, I™m exhausted, can™t we get a little sleep?  He says, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
79 
 
 
war -- there™s a war on, nobody sleep
s. That took care of my c o mp
laint, okay?  La ter on, being 
that I spoke German, he made me so
r t  of like in charge of translat
ing from him to the rest of the 
world, okay?  So was pretty good because once in 
awhile we traded some thing for some food, 
you know, e -- they -- they got fed. We
 -- we got -- the -- the -- it™s 
not a repeat of Gurs, but it™s 
pretty close. Boiled pasta for lunch and supper.
 Now that don™t do much for your system either, 
you know, like beriberi? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know?  Which happened to hit me  after X am
ount of t i me . So I go to the nurse, I didn't 
know what it was. Could be measles, could be ru
beola, I don™t know. I sa
ys, look I got red spots 
all over mys e lf, I don™t k
now. We ll, the re -- German nurse, 
of course. She didn™t know what it 
was either, but just to be on the safe side, she 
was going to put me  in in
sulation, right?  So I don™t 
affect --  

Q: Isola -- isolation. 
A: -- ins -- isolation. 
Q: Right. 

A: Or insulation, isolation -- 

Q: No, isolation. 

A: -- same difference. I was in -- isolated 
from everybody, but insulated too, but okay, fine. 
Q: Right. 

A: So just at that time, our 
friendly camp comma ndant come s in, 
points to me , he says, ﬁ What™s 
the matter with this bast ar d? ﬂ The nurse tells hi m,
 he blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, he goes to 
his holster, unstraps the holster, 
takes off his gun and says, ﬁI™m 
gonna shoot that bastard right 
here.ﬂ So the nurse said to him, of course in
 German, ﬁ You are not going to do any such thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
80 
 
 
Herr Commandant, in my office.ﬂ Well, he actua
lly didn™t shoot me , but she put me  some place 
and I stayed there for a li
ttle while. And I got hold of some  real 
type food, and afte
r a little while 
I got better, and I got back to where 
I was. Now, after a little while -- 
Q: Why would she do that, do you think? 
A: What? 

Q: Why did she protect you?  Or was she -- 

A: We ll, first of all she mi ght not have know
n I was Jewish. Secondly not all Germans were 
[indecipherable]. She was a nurse, she wasn't  there 
to kill people, she was supposed to heal them. 
So she didn't want to -- I swear to
 you [indecipherable]. That™s it.  
Q: But he also could have taken 
you outside and shot you. If he was 
going to pay attention to her, 
right? 

A: She took the wind out of his sail. Oh, not only 
that, wait. She said to me, yeah you™re pretty 
sick, let me  give you a pass so you can go on leave. Oh, I says, well, I got nobody. She 
[inaudible]. So that™s when she put me  in th
e isolation, you know. Wa s 
very funny, she was a -- a 
nice -- a nice human being. I mean, 
I ge -- that™s a
ll I can say.  
Q: And this was in Labenne? 
A: Labenne Oceane. And you know, I te
ll you, we  were right on the ocean. 
Q: Right. 

A: Actually the bluffs overlooking the ocean, 
because you can™t dig on the beach, because there 
you hit water, that™s no good. So we used to dig for the emplacement for the bunkers. Oh, that™s 

all by hand ha -- no machines, everything by shovel
. We  used to dig a hole that was ma ybe 30 
feet deep and 40 feet square and th
en flaring up to about a hundred f
eet at the top so that the sand 
doesn™t run down, you know what I mean?  Wa s a
ll done by shovel, can you imagine how ma ny 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
81 
 
 
people it took? Was like the Chinese coolies. 
And anyway -- and we worked until everything 
was finished. From -- from -- and we -- what I 
-- what my spe c ialty was -- I didn™t pick it, you 
know what rebars are?  Re bars are those steel rods
 that they put in rein
forced concrete. So the 
first thing before you pour the concrete, and I thin
k we -- the walls must have been about 12 feet 
thick if they were an inch. We built the rebars 
fr om the bottom up like this, then straight across 
and then this way. And they gave us a bunch of
 wire, you know, wire, and we -- when rebars 
met, we tied them like that and a pair of pliers to 
-- to cut it off. And we 
were like -- like frigging 
monkeys hanging onto those rebars and the gale
 from the ocean was some thing unbelievable. 
Cold?  Oy. And that was already Ma
rch at the time, or what -- whatever time  it was. No, first 
time was August, this was -- this was February, March. 
Q: And this is when you™re building th
e -- what ™s called the Atlantic wall? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well, let me ask you something, be -- betw
een Gurs and Labenne Oceane, did you go to 
Ca mp Albi? 

A: No, no, that™s later. 

Q: That™s later. 

A: That comes after -- after Labenne Oceane. 

Q: I see, okay.  

A: So, anyway, we™re still building the stuff ther
e. Just to tell you how nice the Germans were, 
first of all they came by, they t
ook the biggest guys they could fi
nd, of course, with the biggest 
German She pherds you ever saw and they pat -- 
and they patrolled the work area. And s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
82 
 
 
believe me , you didn't want to be remi nded to work
 harder by them. The y didn't do it kindly. One 
day -- I™m not inventing things -- they f
ound a guy, they says, guy™s not working hard enough, 
let™s teach him a lesson. They grab him 
-- do you know what a grease gun is?  For -- for 
automotives or machinery?  They took the grease
 gun, inserted this in hi
s rectum, filled it with 
grease, and that was the end of 
that particular episode, and man. 
Q: And you saw that? 
A: No. I was told firsthand, by fi
rsthand. I mean, I didn™t see it. 
Q: So is this period of time  the first time  th
at you™re in a situation 
where there™s a lot of 
brutality? Because the ot her situ
ations, they ma y have been uncomfortable and you didn™t have 
enough food -- 

A: No, Gurs they die -- they -- they died too, 
in the winter, plenty of
 people died there.  
Q: No, no, I™m not talking about dying. I™m
 talking about brut -- brutality. 
A: Oh yeah, it™s the fi rst time I sa
w brutality, yeah. Oh, they were -- 
th-th-they used to cou -- ther 
-- you see, you™re working 16 hours a day in hard la
bor, you get a little tired. So once in awhile it 
would be logical for you to sort of like reston your shovel a little bit 
and so on. And if they 
caught you, they brought you back to
 life, you know. So anyway. So one day I™m comi ng back, 
the food still was horrible, and it™s suppertime, we
™re sitting at a table, and the next thing I know, 
our commandant -- there™s a few 
more episodes in between there.
 They actually paid you. The 
organization paid you, not -- we happened to fall 
in there because we happened to be Jews, we 
don™t really belong there, but we were there, oka
y?  So one day he found out we were Jews, well 
that was the end of that. He cam
e at night to scream at us while we were sleeping. And he 
happened to be a gay, and he had a retinue of 
young me n with him, shall we say?  And then, 
when he came  ti me  to get paid, well you know, they
 sit at the table there,
 with the paychecks and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
83 
 
 
whatnot, you know?  And well, by th
e time -- by that time he knew w
ho was Jewish -- well, every 
two weeks, I guess -- and what he did when he 
saw us come  up, he took his gun, and he put it on 
the table right next to the pay envelope. And youknew better than to grab for the pay envelope, 
okay?  That™s how we managed nicely. So one da
y he realized [indecipherable] that™s not enough, 
I gotta get those guys. He called the Gestapo an
d one night when we came home from work, the 
eight of us Jews were taken off and put on trai
n, in a compartment that™s enough for eight, with 
the head Gestapo dude, and a soldier at each e
nd of the train, do you -- 
the -- the car, you know, 
whatever it is, you know, what you ca
ll that, a b -- the unit, a car 
unit, so that you couldn™t run 
out, whatever. And -- and the guy was very nice, but 
what he really was, he was trying to con 
these yi -- they were all young me n, 
into revealing where their relatives and parents we re, just in 
case they were hiding. And they were so stupi
d, I™m tell -- no, the -- th
e young guys there, I™m 
telling you. That™s when I 
realized the whole world is not exac
tly what you™re supposed to have 
heard about it. People are mostly stupid. I™m te
lling you, how c -- you could fall in this trap?  
Wr ite me a letter, I -- I™ ll make sure it gets 
ma iled, give me  the address. And they did. How 
stupid can you get?  I mean honestly, they didn™t have the brains they were born with. And they 

weren't stupid people, but they™re stupid. You gotta
 be -- you gotta be up 
to every occasion that 
come s along. 

Q: So what -- 

A: How the heck you going to survive? 

Q: What did you do? 

A: Huh?  

Q: What did you do when they asked? 

A: Oh, I have -- I have nobody, I™m all alone in this world. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
84 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Not only that, I spoke German, okay?  
The other one mi ght have been Polish -- 
Q: So where did they -- 
where did they take you? 
A: We ll, to the nearest fortress, which was Bayonne
, an old French fortress that the Germans had 
taken over for a regime nt of whatever it was, and th
ey threw us in a prison cell, was very narrow, 
and there was a steel door, with alittle flap that you could open to look out. I me an, not from the 

inside, from the outside. So I think only four pe
ople fitted in a cell. A
nd I reme mber the -- the 
German offi cer corps came  and looked at what 
Jews look like. You know, 
I mean what the heck?  
He come s in there, hey -- hey Jews, we™ll pick
 them up tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to 
keep them overnight. And the place was run by the German a r my, which wasn™t really bad. And 

I reme mber in the morning they let us out to go and wash up. And whether it was courage or 

stupidity, so you heard the phrase 
that you hear a lot in the funny 
Germa n sitcoms, mach schnell, 
mach schnell, right?  That means hurry up. So I ha
d this orderly there, the German orderly was 
watching us while we were washing, or some th
ing. And he saying this mach schnell, ma ch 
schnell. I got so mad and I start tearing him to pi
eces in German. I mean, really ripping into him 
in German, you know. Told him, what the heck
 you think you™re doing
? Who the heck do you 
think you™re dealing with and whatnot. You know
, not a peep, not one 
repurs -- reparcation -- 
repercussion, it was the most 
amazing thing. I could have gotte
n shot [indecipherable] on the 
spot. Once in awhile you™re --
 you know, it -- it pays 
to get ma d. So anyway, so the fellow -- 
Q: This -- this was in Bayonne? 

A: Bayonne. 

Q: Bayonne. 

A: Bayonne. There™s a fortress there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
85 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I™m sure it™s still there. On
ly because it™s 60 years later, doesn™t mean anything. Must have 

been built 60 years prior to that too. So a
nyway, they put us on a train, and up north we go. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we stop at Albi. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s the name  of the ra
ilroad station and town. And th
e Gestapo ma n must have called 
ahead to the militia and said, I want a con
tingent  of militia men, I™m coming with some 
criminals, whatever he must -- I don™t know what 
he said, I just saw the 
result. There™s eight of 
us, we™re comi ng, get them out of the train, there™s 40 black-clad, helmeted, arme d, militia men 

for eight guys. They didn't  know it, that was 
that -- how ma ny we we
re. So they send him 40 
militias. So -- and they told them -- and they only kept maybe a half a dozen to guard us. Put us 

in the truck and we wound up in th
is camp. And this camp was not 
for Jews or foreigners, this 
camp was for the French resistan
ce fighters that were caught by 
the Germans, or by the French 
sympathizers. You know, either -- either or, 
right?  And they were going to get deported to 
Germany to do slave labor. The Germans use any 
kind of slave labor they
 could get their hands 
on, and they were all young people, obviously. But th
is was a very upscale camp, as far as camps 
go. Clean, neat, beds. They actually ha d some  decent food. I was shocked. But I know that this 

couldn™t last, so after a fe w days -- now, it -- you 
gotta reme mber, I lived for five years with my 
uncle who was an officer in the French army, 
high ranking officer, and I used to hang out with 
all his cronies all the time , you know, the colonels 
and the ma jors and their wives, and all the -- 
because they used to take me over for tea. In
 France there™s a big thing, you have tea in the 

afternoon, you know, little cake, whatever. So I wa s young, they used to sc hlep me , my aunt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
86 
 
 
used to schlep me  along, all the ladies liked 
me , you know, I didn't ma ke the nuisance of myself, 
so I knew how to, you know, behave. And I had the nerve, I asked for an audience with the camp 
commandant. I had -- his name  I reme mber. His 
name  was [indecipherable]. He was a Corsican. 
Yeah, I didn™t think he was that bad because af
ter the war they had -- they h-hu-hung hi m as a -- 
as a war criminal, but I didn't think he was that
 bad [indecipherable]. Not for me , it™s for the 

French people that he did in, you know?  Anyway, so
 I said to him in my 
best military upper class 
voice, I says, mon commandant, I know we are 
mi scast here, we don™t belong here, and if you 
permit me , I would tell you who to contact to ge
t rid of us. Lo and behold, think that I sound one 
of his kind, picks up the phone, calls the comman
dant of Gurs. Now I know the guy loved me , I 
worked for him for you know -- and he says, I 
got this guy here, bla
h, blah, blah, you know, I 
understand you are -- you™re -- you™re in charge, 
would you take him?  Oh, s-sure, send him over. 
So again, in handcuffs, on the railroad, you know 
[indecipherable] such awonderful with the -- 
wi-with the regular people, you got
ta understand. So they looked at us, ma n, some  criminals, I 
don™t know. Was very embarrassing, you 
know -- tell you. And so we got -- 
Q: All eight of you were sent? 

A: Huh?  

Q: All eight of you were sent? 

A: Yeah, well I take the ra -- 
take the eight with me, what 
are we going to do, just me ?   
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: When I was young I saved a lot of people, I got 
a flash for you. I really mean that, not a joke. 
We™ll get to that later, maybe. So, we get ther e,
 put us on a truck, drive us to Gurs. Now Gurs 
had a big gate there, and be -- you know, the gate
, it says Gurs and blah, blah, blah, big portal 
that. And you know, the most touching scene I™ve ev
er seen in my life, 
the whole administration 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
87 
 
 
of the camp was there to welcome us, on account 
of me. Now, that is
 touching. You know?  The 
most -- the police inspectors that I knew. The bo
ss, his assistant and whoever else, was a whole 
bunch of people. Really very touching. And at th
at time , the camp that used to hold on the 
average, 13,000 inma te, ma le, fe ma l e  or whatever, was down to 16 people. Germans worked 
very good. From 13,000 to 16, it™s not bad. And the r
eason that the Fr ench were able to save 
them, they said we need maintenance personnel fo
r the camp. Now, who did they keep is the -- 
the top of the line, of course
. The doctors, the dentist, th
e lawyers, you know. A mu sician, I 
reme mber him. His sister was the nurse, and so o
n, so forth. So they were -- they were there, you 
know?  And then the -- the eight of 
us. And now all of a sudden we
 have 24, it was great. We  also 
-- we s --  still lived in the barracks, but not in 
the barracks barracks. We  lived in the ba rracks that 
the police inspector -- oh yeah, they also didn™t need all the poli
ce inspectors any more because it 
was only 24 people, right?  They only needed admi
nistrative people. So they put us up, again I 
luck out. I got my own room, a real bed, a 
stove, you know?  The only -- 
the only, the -- oh, i-it 
gets better, even. The only drawback
 is, in order to justify us, we 
all had to become  lumberjacks. 
So they took us out in one of those famous car
s. Was a Chevy as a ma tter of fact, station wagon. 
Q: What, that was run on coal? 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: I mean on charcoal? 

A: A 1936 Chevy station wagon. And they dr
ove us up in the woods, you know, like the 
mountains, the beginning of the mountains is w
oods. And the foresters had ma rked up the trees 
that needed to be cut. Now, they were all dead
 oak. Now, oak by itself is 
very hard. If it™s dead, 
it™s like trying to cut steel. Not only that, you 
had to clear away the underbrush, you know?  So 
first you had to clear the underbrus
h, I had -- well, I had the -- the 
other guys with me , eight guys 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
88 
 
 
and me . Tea ms of two there with the saws. Y
ou know those long saws that slightly curve 
[indecipherable]. So I was the hatchet ma n, the ax
e man because I have experience in Castelnot 
as a lumberjack. I did that for quite a long time in
 the winter over there. They send me  in the 
woods, they told me  which trees to cut down all 
by myself. Anyway, so I ha
ve plenty experience, 
I was the axe ma n. So I was the one that had to
 clear the underbrush. An
d if you notice, if you 
look at the tree, the roots grow
 up like this. The roots don™t grow underneath, they grow outside. 
And when they™re oaks and when they™re like 
a hundred years old, I me an we™re talking. So you 
had to chop that up before you coul
d get at the basic tree trunk, and 
the prerequisite was not like 
the lumberjacks over here with the power saw at
 arm™ s height like this
, cutting the 
thing, no. You 
had to cut it right flush with 
the ground. Wonderful, w
onderful exercise. And I have to decide 
which way the tree would fall, so I had to notch 
it in various ways, and then the saw team ca me  
and they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then
 we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you 
know, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it. I 
mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big 
around?  Oh, such fun. And then at night they to
ok us back. The reward wa s, we ate in the 
noncommi ss ioned officer™s me ss, and we wore civili
an clothe s. And that saved our life, because 
after a little while, the Germans in Pau, in the 
commandanture must have he
ard that there™s some 
Jews around there someplace in Gurs. Will never 
do. So one night we™re eating in the me ss, and 
all of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite 
black suited militia come  in. French. Okay. Get 
nervous already. Then I see another pair comi ng 
in. And another pair. So I said to the guys, 
we™re all eating at the same  table, I says, look fe
llows, let™s not ma ke it obvious. Let™s just go out 
here one or  two at a time like we™re finished eat
ing. We  weren™t finished eating but that was no 
time to stick around, right?  So we got out and [ind
ecipherable] out and we 
saw -- see, there™s the 
ma in route, what they call route nationale wa
s running alongside the camp. I told you, the camp 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
89 
 
 
was like a mile long. Wo uld you believe they had 
truckl oads of these militia men that surrounded 
the camp every 50 or a hundred feet, so that
 nobody could escape?  So, what to do, you know?  
The guy™s already in the camp, but I happened to be
 very good friends with one of the -- it was 
one of the older police inspectors in his -- must 
have been 40™s or some  like that. And he was 
ma rried and he was still living in the camp, acro
ss the street in Quonset huts. Very civilized 
though, and he had two kids. So I have one guy with
 me  also, big guy, but he was a real baby. He 
says, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says
, what, I™m going to try to sneak through the 
wire and run across to in -- it was night, a
nd see whether this insp
ector would put me  up 
overnight  until they have left and done their dirt
y deed, right?  He™s like, please take me  along, 
take me  along. I says, hey ma n, what are you crazy, nobody knows you. Well, he ma de such a 
pest of mys -- of himself, I took him along. So 
-- you -- you reme mber, it was the war, so there™s 
blackout, there™s no light s anyplace. Knock on the 
door and either he or hi s wife open up the 
door, I says, blah, blah, blah -- 
Q: Kurt, excuse me , I have to st
op, cause we need to stop the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Seven  
Q: All right, so you™re now in the process of
 escaping with this other guy, and you™ve knocked 
on the commandant™s door and the wife answered. 
A: No, not the commandant, one of the inspectors. 

Q: Oh, I mean one -- one of th
e inspectors, I™m sorry, right. 
A: Yeah. And I says -- explained my situationwhether we could come  in and you know, I have a 

problem. Oh, she pulls us in, and explained 
to them. Oh, she says, sure. Now you gotta 
understand how good the French are. I listen to th
em being torn apart all the time, and I don™t 
listen to this. She had two children. Fi rst thing 
she did, she took the kids
 out of bed, where did 
she put them to sleep, I don™t know. Then, I have
n™t slept in a bed in how long, I don™t know how 
long. She goes ahead and changes the sheet. I said, 
lady, you don™t have to change the sheet. She 
changed the sheet. Now, you know why I say that. 
You couldn™t get soap in France, or stuff you 
use to do a wash. I me a n a -- I™m telling you, it --
 it -- it was a horror show
. So she insisted on 
giving us fresh sheets. So we spent the night ther
e, we slept together in
 the bed, of course, and 
then the following morning we went back and we saw how much da ma ge the German did. 

Couple of guys ma nage d to get lucky, but they 
got a few, you know. And then that was a signal 
for me  that it™s getting toward
s the end, you can not hang out here any more. So I took a gamble. 
I was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at
 this little room, the 
recepti -- reception room, 
and next to me  was the radio operator, you know
, in touch with who knows what. So his name  
was Otis. So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you some thing. Do you by any chance 

know anybody on the underground that™s a guy that
 takes people over th
e Pyrenees? Took a 
gamble. Could have handed me  over to the police, 
too, right, or the Germans?  Says, let me  see, 
come  back in a little while. He set up an appoint
ment with me -- for me 
with some  mountain type 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
91 
 
 
guy, and we me t, suppos edly some  sort of bridge
, I -- I could get out, you know. I me -- I worked 
for the assistant and he -- he had the gate right
 behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the 
place without getting through the barbed wire. 
So I me t hi m,  and meanwhile it became known 
for some  reason that I was gonna get out of the 
camp. And the next think I know, I got four guys 
bugging the bejeebers out of me  
to take them with m -- with
 me , along. There was only one 
drawback. After I saw the guide, he says it™s --
 argume nt-wise, 5,000 what
ever it is per person. I 
says okay. I had -- I always had some  money, I work
ed. Even in the camp when I was the orderly 
I ma de money, fine. Always had money. But the ot
her dudes didn™t have any money. So what are 
we gonna do?  I have to rustle up a fortune of mo
ney. So in the mi ddle of the night we used to 
sneak out of the camp and sell everything we coul
d get rid of, we didn™t 
need. So eventually -- 
and then I we nt to some  guy I know who had a lo
t of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah, 
I™m shy so much mone y, how about it? So he gave
 it to me. So finally I have got all the money 
and when we went out the camp at night, wa
s the winter anyway, 
it was January the 21
st
, 1944 -- 
so I gave him the mone y and the money wasn™t for 
him. He -- during the day they had to hide us 
in a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us. In order to buy food they needed money, that™s 
what the mo ney was for. And you know the Pyrenees
 fooled me a lot. I had no idea, I™m telling 
you, I™m naïve in every re-respect. Only once though, you don™t do it twice with me . But the first 

time around, anything goes. I saw the mountain, I sa
ys, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other 
side is Spain, no big deal. Imagine my disappointme nt when we get on top of the mountain, 

what™s across the s -- from me  as far as I can
 see, another mountain, just as high. We ll, there 
were six of them. I™ll ma ke it shor t because w-we
 don™t have a week. The last week -- the last 
day, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier. 

Now, we we ren™t exactly dressed. Re
me mber this is between January 21
st
, and January 27
th
, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
92 
 
 
alright?  And in the mountains that™s not exactly 
summertime weather. And 
especially without the 
proper equipment. So we hitting this glacier --
 oh, by the way, those guide
s were all volunteer. 
They walked the whole night, and 
then they c -- they -- they coul
d walk much better than us, 
then the following -- well, the followi ng morning, they
 ran back to the -- th
eir day job. Some  of 
them were e-engineers on a -- on a train. Some  did 
ta -- they -- th-they di
d that -- they didn't get 
any sleep for 24 hours. They did 
that without a nickel of rem
uneration. The money was strictly 
for the farmers so they could buy food for us. 
Logical situation, which 
we didn™t know but we 
found out. So we climbed during the night. The reas
on that it took so long
 -- there™s a perfectly 
good road that goes along in the valley, the onl
y trouble is that it™s 
patrolled by Germans, 
because that™s the road between
 Spain and France. So we went
 over every mountain without any 
roads whatsoever. Wa s horror show. I once fell down 
the side of a mountain cliff just like that. 
And it™s just like in th
e movies, th-the only thing that st
opped me  between heaven and earth, 
there was this shrub sticking out fr
om that cliff. And I get ahold of it. So now I™m looking up and 
I see the guys on top and I look 
down below. And the guides came , he was  like s -- more of a 
mountaineer, right? You see, there wa s -- the pass was that wi de, there wa s no light. And it had 
eroded, there was a hole like that an
d I didn™t see, and I stepped ri
ght in that hole. The way we 
could see is -- you know what a mus e
tte is?  That™s like a bread bag th
at they have in France for 
the soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they™re
 usually in light canva
s. So, was flung over the 
back from the guy, so that™s what you were
 focusing on because him you couldn™t see, you 

know?  Phew. So he came and got me  back up agai
n. Oy. That was scary. I didn™t scream, either. 
Not a peep out of me , I wasn™t giving anybody away. 

Q: So you were walking for six nights? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
93 
 
 
A: Mm-hm. And I mean, walking 
up the mountain is bad, you can™t 
believe what it is to walk 
down the mountain. You can™t walk down the 
mountain, you run, because there™s no way -- 
anything to stop you. It™s
 so steep, you run. 
Q: Now one  of these guys had a little dog with him, didn™t he? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, tha -- tha -- that™s nice. 
That -- I-I said to him -- that™s the guy whose 
job I got through -- you know, who did some  tricks
, but he loved his dog. Okay, fine. A s mall 
German She pherd, or young German Shepherd. I sa
ys, he is totally insa
ne, I couldn™t talk him 
out of it. All right. So the first st
ep, the first night, we™re on the -- off a cliff i-in a shepherd™s hut, 
you know, trying to get a little warm, you know, and 
get a little rest. And it was on a cliff 
overlooking down below. After a li
ttle while, what ever it was, we
™re walking out of there and 
I™m the last guy out and I happen to look down th
ere. Down there™s a German patrol with a 
Shepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat 
the band. Why?  He smelle
d the other dog. Not us 
so much as the dog. Man, did we have to r
un, and the guy didn™t even have any pepper or 
anything like that he could have sprinkl
ed around on the track. That was a good one. 
Q: But the dog he had never barked? 

A: No [indecipherable] 

Q: That™s quite amazing, right? 

A: Look, I don™t analyze things, not at that time . 
Later on you have time to analyze. While it™s 
happening there™s no psychoanalysis, you know?  So 
after six days we™re now faced -- oh yeah, 

excuse me . On the six days we me t two more 
groups. One group was people that were very well 
heeled, with the proper equipment, you know
, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the 
shoes with spikes, and then the right kind of 
rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you 
know, filthy rich people. They didn't like it any 
more either. I don™t know whether they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
94 
 
 
Jewish or not, most -- more likely they™re no
t. And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys. 
Four Americans and a Br itish. They have -- ha
ve been channeled by th
e French underground all 
the way back to where our meeting point was. You 
know, the French used to hide them at night. 
You know, ma ybe they came all the way -- I don™t 
know from where, but they were shot down 
over, you know, Ger man territory. So
 for some  reason they -- the ri
ch people went their own way 
-- they elected me as their leader. Okay? I™m not 
a soldier or anything like 
that, I™m their leader , 
hallelujah. Same way I was the lead
er of the other dudes. They all 
were older than me. So we™re 
facing this glacier there, sheer wa
ll. So the mountain ma n, he has this pick, you know this -- they 
got these things, they™re those picks, and he™s hack
ing a step into the ice, one step at a time. So 
here -- it™s like a bunch of monke
ys, we™re all hanging on for dear li
fe, one hand in this -- in -- in 
the step and the other one was 
standing there, and the guy in fr
ont of you is standing there. 
Finally you ma ke it to the top. And the top is 
one sheer field of ice, going down like this. 
Anyway you want to look at, sheer ice. We ll, we
 get to the top and guide says to me , well okay, 
this is th -- that -- this is one for the ages
. You follow that river, 
and that will lead you to 
civilization. I said to him, river? Wha t  -- what
 the heck are you talki
ng about?  I don™t see any 
river. I have 20/20 vision, didn™t 
see any river. I says, you™re in
 -- you™re not going to leave me  
here. You take me  where that ri
ver allegedly is. Co me s with me
 and it was ice, I™m telling you, 
it™s like I said, it™
s a sheer glacier. So -- and underneat
h, all of a sudden, 
there™s a slight 
discoloration underneath the ice, it™s grayish. He
 says, you see that?  That™s the river. You follow 
that, okay?  That™s how a river st
arts some place, I guess. I can vouch 
for it because it turned into 
a river. So like good pedestrians, we walk on th
e right side of nothing, 
underneath the ice. And 
slowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ev
er been to New Ha mpshire, you s
ee in those rapids over there, 
splashing over the stone. Scary. Not very deep, 
but scary when you don™t k
now that. So all of a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
95 
 
 
sudden, we™re on the right side and there™s no pl
ace to walk any more because there™s a sheer 
cliff like that, the -- the river must have gouged it
 out. But the opposite side is perfectly nice and 
flat. There™s only one thing wrong. By now that quote,
 no river, was ma ybe, let me  see, I want to 
keep it within the frame work of reality. Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide. And it™s [indecipherable]. So 
we took off our shoes and then we looked whethe
r there was a stone to step on, and we ma de it 
to the other side. Now the other 
side was mud, but was 
plenty room to walk, and it was like the 
Grand Canyon. It was completely gouged out like
 this, yo -- you know?  It 
-- like a cover. And 
we kept on walking and walking and walki
ng and walking, there™s hours, you know. And the 
only sound that you heard once in awhile was 
the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know, 
that carries very far in the -- in an icy nei
ghborhood and in the woods with no other noise, you 
know?  And once in a blue moon we  saw a Spaniard. Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil 

War veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [ind
ecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they 
thought we were Spaniards. Here
 goes. We  come around the corner
, and we froze. What™s in 
front of us like -- hard to say accurately, let™s 
say 500 feet. A platoon of Germans with trucks and 
everything. I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. And you know 
who was the most scared?  Hate to tell 
you. The soldier boys. They were going to hightail it
. I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not 
as well as now, but spoke some  English enough 
to get by. I says, hold it. If these are Germans 
they™re going to shoot you the mi nute you start r
unning. Let™s take it easy, they don™t seem to be 
all that dangerous. They keep on staring at th
e Germans there. German helmet, Ger ma n boots, 

German uniforms, Ger man everything. Some th
ing -- and all of a sudden I saw what was 
different. The belt and the bandoliers
 were bright yellow. We ll, th
e Germans are either brown or 
black. So then I knew they were Germans. So we
 had no choice but to walk up to them. So the 
allied sold -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
96 
 
 
Q: The soldiers were not German.  
A: Of course not, not with a b -- yellow bandolier, you know, and a yellow belt. With -- the 

Germans ha ve black and -- or brown. You know, th
at™s what -- that™s what stopped me , I knew 
there was some thing different. And so we wa
lk up to them, and the other guys identified 
themselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogt
ag, whatnot. They put them on the truck, drove 
them to the nearby embassy in -- it must be B
ilbao or some  town there, I don™t reme mber. Okay?  
They were home  free. Us, we don™
t deserve, because we weren™t 
the only guys that came  across, 
we don™t deserve no trucks. We  haven™t walked 
enough, only six days, or six nights. So we™re 
walking, and we™re schlepping, we™re schlepping. Th
e next thing we know, they threw us into a 
one cell dungeon, the filthiest pl ace I ever seen in
 my life. Wi ndow up ther
e, no place to sleep or 
nothing. So the following day we wind up -- I 
don™t know whether we got on a truck, I don™t 
reme mber. I can™t swear, I ga -- what I can™t 
swear to, I™m not saying. We  wind up in Bilbao. 
Where did they take us? To Spanish Gestapo he
adquarters. Pure ma rble everything. I don™t mean 
the outside, I don™t mean the wall, I don™t mean
 the floor. I mean the benches you sat on, all 
ma rble. This is after Franco [indecipherable],I don™t know, it™s -- this is
 1941 -- ™44, and the war 
is over in ™39, and they were poor as church mi
ce, proverbial. So each and every one go -- gets 

interviewed. Now, obviously we didn™t come  al
ong with papers. Now being that I™m as good as 

any Frenchma n ever wa s, all of a sudden I™m
 French. Took my France -- French name , 
birthplace, the whole thing. The only thing that I 
did, I lied. The only time  in my life actually -- 
you don™t have to believe me , but it™s true. I fudge
d my age. All of a sudden I was 17 years old. I 
looked very young, I was emaciated, 
haven™t eaten in four years. So, you know, I looked very 
young. They bought it. Sa ved my life .  

Q: How?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
97 
 
 
A: We ll, if you were of army age, right?  M
eaning 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 or older, you wound up in 
Miranda. Miranda was a death camp 
like Andersonville from t he Civil Wa r. Just as bad as the 
German concentration camps. Just as bad. So
 I wound up with the old 
people and the children. 
Fantastic. Wound up in a little rest 
-- no, first in town they put us 
up in a real nice 
restaurant, the 
first decent meal I had had in five
 years -- four years, okay? Of 
course I was with the French, you 
know, I was French. No paper, but I was Fren
ch. And nobody was going to say I™m not French. 
Nobody would believe me  if I would have told
 them, which at one time  I did, and nobody 
believed me  anyway. Couldn™t be. Couldn™t be that
 I™m not French. Okay, fine. So the following 
day they take us and we wind up in a small -- 
let™s say town, way up in
 the mountain and in a 
nice, little hotel. Now I™m living, together 
with older people, you know
. I don™t know how ma ny, 
let™s say 15 -17 or so. And we were plenty of 
food. The Spaniard for some  reason had food, and I 
want to tell you how that came about
. The -- they -- they tho -- span
ic -- spa -- Spain is very arid 
and poor, and all they grew was 
olive and o-oranges. We ll, how 
come  they had food?  Well, for 
every allied prisoner that they turned in to the al
lies, the United States gave them a 75 kilo bag of 
grain, or 175 pound bag of grain. Wheat. And they 
paid them X a mount  of dollars per prisoner. 
So they had a ma rvelous business to -- even 
though they were leani
ng towards Hitler -- you 
know, Franco, well, you can™t pass up a good deal lik
e that. The allies were smart. So they 
bought all of their prisoners and 
th-that™s how come  the Spaniard
s had food. And at for -- they 
got strangest eating ours, but that™s not here nor 
there. At four or five o™clock in the afternoon 
they ma de chocolate, you know, hot
 chocolate?  But they don™t ma
ke it like powder, they take 
chocolate bars, and you know when the chocolate 
is finished, you can put a spoon in and it stays 
upright, that™s how thick that chocolate is. But we 
had a lot of nice food there. That didn't  last too 
long. Then they threw me again in anothe
r camp with hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
98 
 
 
hundreds of French people, young peopl
e, also refugees from France,
 also in the mountains, and 
they put us in a -- well, that must have been 
the spa in peacetime, you know, like a big hotel, and 
with plenty of rooms, and -- and 
-- and dining room and things like 
that. So we stayed there for a 
little while and then they transfer
red us to another one that was 
actually even nicer, but by that 
time it™s already going on towards spring. Now a
nybody that tells you that Spain is wa rm is 
mi staken, he has never hang -- hung around northern Spai
n, it is freezing. It 
is freezing. And we 
always had to get out there for the colors, you 
know, like -- you know, when
 they raise the flag 
and things like?  One night we -- we
 had to stand there. One of th
eir things, what can I tell you?  
And then we wound up -- oh yeah, and I -- I was 
under the mi sconception th
at oh, I™ll get out of 
here in no time  flat, you know, wound up in North 
Africa. So I never bothered learning Spanish. 
So one month goes by, I™m still there. Two months
 goes by, I™m still there. 
After three months a 
light goes on, I says, fella, you were vastly mi
staken, you™re net gotten 
-- you™re not getting out 
of here so fast, better learn Sp
anish. Not bragging, stating facts. 
I lear ned perfect Spanish in three 
weeks. I was so good in Spanish that I used to write 
love letters for the -- for the fellas to write -- 
to send to the girls. 

Q: Before you learned Spanish, where di
d you think you would go?  Why did you -- 
A: North Africa, of course. 

Q: Why?  

A: That™s where the French were, free French.  

Q: I see, so you thought the 
Spanish would send you there? 
A: No, no. 

Q: What [indecipherable] 

A: Not the Spanish, the Spanish hand me  over 
to the free French who™d take care of me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
99 
 
 
Q: No, that™s what I meant, that™s what you expected them to do. 
A: Yeah, and they eventually did. The only problem was the French had the ma rvelous system. 

You could tell them any kind of fairy tale like 
I found out in the Foreign Legion, not for myself, 
but for other people, and by the time  they ha
d you screened, which took a fe w weeks, you gotta 

reme  -- realize that French was occupied terr
itory, they knew exactly who you were. They knew 
your police record if you had one. They knew where you were born, you knew -- they knew your 

real name. That -- they let you te
ll them anything you wanted, but th
ey wanted to investigate and 
they could find out. So naturally 
I didn™t have any papers, I have to come  clean. So what was my 
choice?  The Foreign Legion. I wanted the French 
army, right?  Couldn™t do it. I wasn™t French, 
you know, and they didn™t -- you know. So I wo
und up in the Foreign Legion. And the Foreign 
Legion, eventually we were sent to Casabl
anca, you know, from[indecipherable] which is 
Gibraltar, to Casablanca, you know, th
ese -- take the ship there. It™s 
across the Straights, it™s very 
-- you know, the two oceans collide, the Mediterra
nean and the Pacific -- and the -- and the 
Atlantic, and let me tell you, 
it™s not a peaceful meeting. 

Q: Right. 

A: Whew, my God, unbelievable. 
That was my second sea storm, but anyway -- well that one 
was the first one, anyway. And so we wound up in a big army base in Casablanca and they 

interrogate me and the British were there that 
were doing the interrogation and they were very 
thrilled with all the information Icould give them about the Atlan
tic Wa ll. You see, what, where, 
how much, how fast, how big, how deep, what
 was the weaponry, what -- I had all that 
information and [indecipherable] to get a guy firs
thand information, okay? So we were together 
with French Colonial troops and there also were
 Americans on the base. Now I said to myself, 
the Foreign Legion, I™m not that cr
azy about it. From what I hear, 
it™s not a place to be . So I saw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
100 
 
 
two army officers, American, comi ng by. Being that 
I spoke a little English, I went up to them, I 
says, ﬁGentlemen, excuse me , I woul d really like 
to join the American army.ﬂ Oh, obviously they 
were from t he quartermaster depot. They were
 uninterested, you know?  That was my chance of 
serving in the American Ar my. I knew that the Fo
reign Legion was going to be the absolute pits 
of the world, which it wa s, but that™s a -- you know.
 So -- and I saw the strangest things there. 
The Moroccans were the nicest of all Arabs, I 
tell you. The further east 
you go, the worst they 
get. The Moroccans are the nicest. The Algeri
ans already, forget it. The Tunisian, no good. 
Libya, after that, forget, it™s the 
end of the world. But the Moroccans aren™t bad. They were real 
nice. That™s the first time I sa
w pot. I didn't know what it was. 
Q: Saw wha t? 

A: Pot. Marijuana. And [indecipherable] in th
e bags just sitting outsi
de, and there™s this 
Moroccan dude, some  older gent. He pulls a tiny 
little s -- white cerami c pipe, with a thimble 
type bowl. And he™s stuffing the thing. And I said
 to him, in French obviously, I says, what™s 
that?  He said, kief. You want a shot? Do you wa nt
 to try it?  I said, oh, no thank you. So kief is 
the fi rst time I met with marijuana. He was smoking kief. 
Q: Right. You -- you were figh
ting, am I -- am I correct? 
A: Huh?  

Q: You were -- you were actually fighting at
 some  point, at the end of the war? 
A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, yeah. 

Q: In France and Germa ny? 

A: Yeah, yeah. You know, after they
 screened us and blah, blah, bl
ah, and I was attached to this 
French legion division, and to that one and this, 
that, eventually we wound up in the desert as an 
assembly point, then we took the LST™s, you 
know, the big landing craft, you put the doors open 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
101 
 
 
in the front? And we we nt from [indecipherable] 
to Marseille. Marseille was a French port, we 
could -- right into the town, you know, because the -- 
like, what they call the [indecipherable]. It 
was like the -- a wall, you know
, a -- what you would call a s
eawall, you know, you could -- and 
you just dropped the doors and it 
went over, it was very -- actually
 it was be -- between me  and 
my lieutenant we were the first one
 off the ship, you know?  And so --

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Okay. So you™re on a -- some  sort of a ve
ssel, right, that goes into Marseille and -- 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. We ™re landing in Marseille,
 and then we follow up the Rhone river valley, 
because it ha d been clear alr
eady by previous troops, Americans possibl y, you know, I don™t 
know. And what amazed me  the mo st and what mo
st people don™t realize was how rich a country 
France was. The Germans had to abandon all the cars 
that they took from th
e French trying to get 
home  with them. On each side of the road -- this 
is hard to believe -- for, let™s sa y a mi nimu m of 
three - 400 miles, were abandoned cars, three ro
ws of abandoned cars. Now, can you picture how 
well the Fr ench were doing? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That™s for hundreds of miles, three beside. 
Anyway, we went -- we 
wound up at the triangle -- 
the triangle of [indecipherable], 
Vivier, and I forget the other town, and there we have a little 
stopped, and then we hit -- oh what™s -- what™s 
the town called there? Belfort. And you know, 
that™s -- you know, little fighting, l
ittle this and we are st uck in mud again. The halftracks are 
stuck, the trucks are stuck. I mean, it™s unbelieva
ble the mu d, and it™s like where the Ardennes 

are, the Vosges come  together, you know, 
the mountains whereall the World Wa r 
1
 battles were 
fought. S-Same  story all over the world, never change
s. And then we slowly, when it really gets 
cold, we advance into Germany. Actually, we st
ayed in Alsace-Lorrain
e near Strasbourg for a 
little bit, and then, some time later, must have been
 April or some thing, we  crossed the Rhine at -- 
I don™t know, a -- a -- a -- where. The Americ
ans had built a pontoon bridge, you know, and one 
cami -- one -- one truck at a time , you know, boom, 
boom, and then we™re rolling into Germany, 
and things like that. And then we went from one 
village to the next, from one town to the next. 
And then eventually we wound up in this lovely, l
ovely little town, shortly 
before the end of the

war, and the people were very nice. Got myself a 
girlfriend obviously, and that
™s first thing I did. 
Had p -- I had plenty of freedom, I was -- I don™
t know whether -- I didn™t
 mention it, I won™t 
think so. As a private first class, that™s as 
h -- far as I got, I was running the motor pool. Can you 
imagine that, all by myself?  No stripes, no nothin
g. I had mor e  clout than 
any officer ever had. I 
ran the whole motor pool. Jeep, GMC trucks, Dodge tr
ucks, halftracks. You name  it, I ran it all. I 
ordered the parts, wa -- I used to be -- I-I told
 you, I spoke some  English. 
So all the orders have 
to be written or filled out in English, 
because requisitions were in English. 
Q: Why wer e  they in English? 
A: We ll, the Americans were supplying us.  

Q: I see. 

A: We  got supplied by the Americans. Food, w
eapons, uniforms. Everything was American, you 
know?  And that was great because -- as long as th
e war lasted. After that it wasn™t so good. So 
anyway -- 
Q: So at this point, how much do you know 
about what the Nazis have done in -- 
A: At that time  we weren™t talking Nazis any mo
re, we were just talking fighting the Germans. 
Q: I know you -- I know you weren™t necessarily talk
ing about it, I want to know wha t  you knew. 
Did you know anything? 
A: Wa -- 

Q: Did you know [indecipherable] 

A: -- I knew from before, I knew that there were 
Auschwitz, and that people didn™t come  out of 
it. That™s what I knew from -- 

Q: Did you know there were gas chambers?  Di
d you know that people were being gassed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
104 
 
 
A: I -- I -- I -- I -- I mi ght have known, I can™t sw
ear to you -- to it, because this was ve ry 
removed from the stress of hour
 to hour living. We™re not talk
ing day to day, you know?  Even 
while I was in Castelnot, it 
was never a relaxing thing. 
Q: Right. 
A: Either I was totally exhauste
d from work. There was -- for we
eks I couldn™t straighten out my 
hands after six weeks of hoeing the vineyards. 

Q: Right. 

A: They were cramped like that. 

Q: No, the only reason I™m asking you Kurt, is not to
 be critical or anyt
hing, it™s a question of 
trying to figure out what people knew when, a
nd what difference did it make, that™s all. 
A: For -- for -- for -- for -- ™42, it wa
s a -- was a known fact. In ™42 -- 
Q: But you really didn™t know what it m
eant at that point. But that™s -- 
A: No, it just meant death. That™s the only thing th
at we knew, that the German were killing the 
Jews in Auschwitz, you know. 

Q: Did you know there were other camps?  

A: In terez -- yeah, Theresienstadt, whatever
, you know?  Bergen-Belsen and d-d -- Dachau was 
well known because that™s in Germany. You know, D
achau and the -- and a couple of more there 
which escape me  right now. So that we knew, becau
se we knew that they didn™t treat the Jews 

nicely when they picked them up.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They were very, very cruel and gruesome . I m
ean, they did it to their 
own people. Hitler used 
to hang his own bodies from meathooks, you know, 
when he was unhappy with them, so you can 
imagine how well they treated the Jews.

Q: Did your mother and father lose family? 
A: Yeah. My mother lost a sister. 

Q: Is that the sister who st
ayed with her grandmother? 
A: No. No, no. 

Q: I mean, the grandfather. 

A: The oldest one, the oldest one. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The oldest one that didn™t wa
nt to send my na me sake boy -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- to live with my aunt in Fran
ce. They stayed there, they di e
d. That™s her side of the fa mily. 
My father™s fa mily, everybody, his father, 85, his two 
brothers, his sister th
at ma rried a Catholic, 
and the nuns hid her and her daughter, because yo
u see, because you™re ma rried to a Ca tholic, 
and Jewish, doesn™t count. It even makes the guy
 that ma rried you a prime target for retribution, 
you know?  So she swore that if she ev
er got out of that al
ive, that she™ll conve
rt to Christianism -
- or Christianity or whatever. So -- and th
en her two children were
 obviously -- well, not 
obviously, they were born Jewish. You know what
 I™m saying?  But, you know, they were half 
and half, so it™s very hard to say. So my father 
was the most people, because he had -- my -- my 
g -- grandfather died before. My grandm- mothe
r died before him on my mother™s side. My 
mother got out, my aunt in France got out, my au
nt in England got out. It™s only the sister that 
insisted, oh, they™re not going to touch us. 

Q: One of the sisters stay
ed with your grandfather. 
A: Yeah, that™s the youngest one. 

Q: And did she get out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
106 
 
 
A: Yeah -- 
Q: She got out, uh-huh. 

A: -- in ™39 she got out to E
ngland, it only cost everything.  
Q: Right. 

A: The house, the store, every kind 
of last nickel 
that she had. 
Q: When you me t up with your pa
rents after you -- I know you were 
very sick at the end of the 
war, you had amoebic dysentery, yeah? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And you came back to be with your parents 
and you were still quite ill. Did you -- did your 
parents then know what had happened to other 
members of the fa mily, by then, or not? You 
don™t -- or you don™t know. 
Maybe you were too sick. 
A: We ll, I can tell you, the business of living an
d staying alive was unbeli
evable. Let me tell you 
how sick I was. There was nothi
ng to eat in France, so my mo
ther went around, she was very 
good friends with the baker lady. She went over 
to the baker lady, trying v -- v -- everybody was 
on ration, I mean the French, everybody, so -- trying 
to get a slice of bread for me  or some thing 
like that. Now, couldn™t get a slice of bread, co
uldn™t get nothing. Vegetables, yes. There were 
vegetables, you could get some  eggs, chicken once 
in a blue moon, but no me at. Once in a blue 
moon you got a -- a -- on your ration cards you 
got like a pound of meat for the mont h, or 
some thing like that. Maybe. Not sure yet. I 
rem -- I don™t reme mber. I know one [indecipherable] 
was over, you know. Or anyway. So she™s sitti
ng there with the baker 
lady, goes to show you 
what shape I was in, says, Monsieur Claude -- 
and my na me  was Claude in France, not Kurt. 
Kurt and the French and the Germans, so Claude 
was a little safer. Ah, Monsieur Claude is such 
a nice young man. What a shame he has to
 die. That™s the shape I was in.

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: See, the farmers, this was a farm community, ar
e far more at ease with life and death than city 
people. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: All right, we™re not
 talking now, but you know, in [indecipherable] 

Q: So how long were you sick? 

A: God almi ghty. I™d sa -- I got back to Nort
h Africa from Germany, must have been June 1945. 
I must -- mu st have taken -- yeah, that was the 
second time I had ma ybe dysentery when we left 
for France, you know, for the invasion. But that wa
s the first time and that was quite -- quite a 
long time, and the -- when I went back to France and I got some  decent food, at mi dnight I used 

to go over to the farm ladies and says, could you 
maybe bake me a little apple pie or  so mething?  
So they did and I took care of myself, all righ
t?  I mean, the Americans supplied us too, but you 
know, k-rations and such, it™s not -- you know
. But anyway, so I beat it eventually. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The second time, being that I had still the ge
rm in me , obviously, it took two weeks before I 

was flat on my back again. But being a soldier you have no choice. The Foreign Legion is not 

too much into people. The Foreign Legion is much
 more into equipment. They would sacrifice 
20 me n to save a truck, easy, no problem. 
Oh, we ™ll get 20 more tomorrow, no problem. 
Q: When you went back 
to s -- when you went f -- 
A: So anyway, just to answer the question -- 

Q: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah. 

A: -- from J uly, all the way to the end of Nove mber. 

Q: That™s a long time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
108 
 
 
A: Augu -- July, August, September, October, N
ovember, five  months. And I looked it, I have 
pictures to prove it. 
Q: Did your parents think you were alive? Did th
ey -- did they have a
ny idea where you were?  
So when -- how did -- did you write to them first, 
or did you just walk up to the door, sick as you 
were?  

A: But at that time -- at that time, fr om 
North Africa, which was French, I was able to 

communicate with my a unt and uncle. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I really didn™t know at that time where my -- 

Q: Where your parents were, right. 

A: -- parents were, but my aunt and uncle, or my a
unt at least, was in touc
h with my parents, so 

henceforth they knew I was okay. 

Q: Right. 
A: But for quite a few years my parents didn™t know -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- where I was, or whether 
I was alive, you know, that -- 
Q: Right. And where were your parents when you finally saw them?  

A: In Castelnot Rivierbas, yeah. 

Q: They -- oh, they went there again, I see. 

A: We ll, I don™t know what -- well, th
at™s the place that they knew -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and they were well known there, and by that time they must have had some  re mor se, you 

know, the police departme nt and they treated th
em rather well, you -- if you know what I mean. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
109 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: And -- 

Q: Did you and your br
other go to Grenoble? 
A: Yeah, my brother, from Castel
not -- I stayed a long time , I wasn
™t well, I couldn™t walk let™s 

say from tha t  end to that end. I mean, I couldn™
t, I was so weak. Anyway, my father got the 
doctor. We  had one doctor in the village, and he
 was very good diagnostic
ian, and he prescribed 
little ampules. You know what ampul es are? Glass 
vials and they™re filled with cultures. So my 
fa ther t-take the train to the bi
g city, have the prescription filled, 
come  ba ck with the prescription 
and then I a -- I dr ank this twice 
a day in some  water. And eventually -- the doctor had it right on 
the money, slowly, slowly, slowly. But the st re
ngth was slow in comi ng because there was no 
food for me  -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- to get strong on, or with. So -- 
Q: So Harry goes first? 
A: Harry knew that in Ca stelnot there™s only 
farm work, that™s no future. So Grenoble was a 
wonderful college city -- univers
ity city actually, and in the 
house actually, lit
tle bit, you know. 
Very pretty, beautiful buildings
. And he start -- he found a job there. And then, when I was 
strong enough, well, I couldn™t stay
 in Castelnot, again 
there was nothing there for me , so I went, 
and we both lived in the same  s m-s mall room, furnis
hed room that I had rented, and in the small, 

itsy-bitsy s --  bed with the sagging mattress until 
I star ted working and ma de a living and could 
afford my own furnished room, in the same  place, of course. 

Q: Right. Now I understand that your parents and 
Harry left for the United States in 1947? 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
110 
 
 
Q: And why did they come  to the United States 
if things were starting to go okay in France, do 
you know?  
A: What my  father going to do at that age? 

Q: He was over 60. 

A: He can™t -- he can™t make -- he can™t make a 
-- in France he can™t ma ke the living, you -- it™s 
not like the United States, you come , you apply fo
r a job, if the guy likes you, you get it. Uh-uh. 
Over there the papers, you gotta see. I got pa
pers that you wouldn -- you 
wouldn™t believe what it 
takes in France to get a job, you know?  So my a
unt from Ge rmany, the single one that stayed 
with my grandfather, got to England, was in 
the United States and had ma rried an American 
fellow, I think, and he had an extended fa mily, 
wonderful people, and they put up the bail for me  
to come  to the United States and for my parent
s. You know how much you have to put up for me  

when I came  a year later?  10,000 dollars so I w
ould -- shouldn™t fall, youknow, th-that the state 
would have to take care of me .  
Q: Right. 
A: That™s when you immi grate ill
egally -- or emigrate. That™s 
the difference between then and 
now. And not only that, had to go to
 the embassy in Paris and the doctor screened me like I was a 
-- a Michelangelo there. You know, ch
ecked me  for being defect free. 
Q: Did you want to come to the United States? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: No. 

Q: Why not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
111 
 
 
A: I was doing very well in France, I had a ma
rvelous job. Had a lot of respect, had 25 people 
working for me . I magine , I was a big 24 - 25 years 
old at the time . And -- a
nd t -- they treated me 
wonderful. The only thing is that my parents and 
my brothers used to hound me  with letters. 
How can you stay there, you™re all 
alone, you™re all single, whatev --
 first of all, I wasn™t all 
alone. Number two, I had my aunt and my uncle in
 Vichys that I used to go and visit every once 
in awhile, my second set of parents, you know?  A
nd I had a girlfriend that
 took real good care of 
me .  

Q: So why -- 

A: So what the problem, you know? 

Q: So why did you leave? 

A: They kept on hounding me  to death. 

Q: I see. 

A: You can™t stay there, da da da. I came  over 
here -- of course, it was 
an experience, an eye-
opener, because the United States, even though it
 was originally populated by white people from 
Europe, is so different from Europe, like night and day. There™s no -- 
there™s not even -- you 
can™t even compare. The closes
t you could conceivably come  to 
compare one with the other is 
Germany and the United States. But even that is r
eally a st retch. The attitude, the me ntality, the -
- it™s totally different here. Look, 
I want to just explains to y
ou how -- let™s forget Hitler which 
was the worst thing in the world. Happened to the world, not just the Jews. Germany had social 

security under Bismarck, we
™re going back to the 19
th
 century, okay, okay? They were pretty 
advanced, right?  You work in France [indeciphe
rable] twice, doesn™t 
ma tter who your boss is, 
you can change jobs five times a year. As long as
 you work a four months, you get credit for that 
four months. For every month you work -- I™m going back to 1948 -- ™46 -- ™47, you get one and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
112 
 
 
a half days vacation, right?  Which me ans 18 da
ys a year, working days. Plus a bonus, not your 
salary, but a little extra, so you 
should actually be able to enjoy 
a vacation. I think that™s very 
progressive. You™re not at the me rcy of a boss. Th
is is state ma ndated. You 
retire at the ripe old 

age of 60 with 80 percent of 
your earning. Over here you get So
cial Security, if you make 20 
percent you™re doing real good. Y
ou -- you -- you know what I™m saying?  So there -- there are 
differences, and these are the large differen
ce that you don™t even know when you come  here. 
Q: But did you likeit when you came  here? 

A: No. 

Q: No. Do you like it now? 

A: Oh, I -- I -- let me put it to you this way. I 
just loved and admi red the United States okay? 
Q: Mm. 

A: Now, the way that things were set up and th
e way I was abused at th
e beginning, work-wise, I 
wasn™t exactly my cup of tea. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: See, the first job that I 
had, took a long time to find, the mi nute they found out I was not an 
American citizen, they cut my salary, that™s for 
openers. Then they cheated me  out of overtime, 
until I found out and of course, as much as my Englis
h wasn™t as fluent as it is now, I eventually 

got my overtime. But that™s the attitude -- you kn
ow, how can you -- in France I never had to ask 
for a raise. They came around to ask the supervis
or, foreman, management, whatever, and says, 
who do you have that me rits rais
e this month?  You ne
ver had to ask for a raise, if you were 
worth it. And we™re working on me rit there, not on 
bullshit. That™s the big difference. So it takes 
a little while to get used to this. No, the best th
ing that ever happened to me here was me eting my 
wife, and obviously I had the good sense and the perseverance to ma rry her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
113 
 
 
Q: This is Ba rbara?  
A: Beg pardon? 

Q: What™s her name , Ba rbara? 

A: Barbara. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- I mean, there™s one philosophy I always ha
d. Wherever you are, you 
ma rry a girl of this 
particular country, you know. Li
ke in France I had a French girlfriend. In Germany, I had 

German girlfriends, you know. So, no sh -- she wa s 
wonderful, it™s -- I mi ss her big time , but -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- I have to keep on -- my d -- my -- my da
ughter wants me  to keep on living forever. You 

know, my -- my -- my ol dest da
ughter wants the house, you know, wh
en she retires. So I don™t 
know how long I can accommodate her. See, as l
ong as I™m self sufficient, it™s not mu ch of a 

problem.  
Q: Right. 
A: But I can see myself, I guess, in some  of
 the people around here. Especially, you go to 
doctors, I mean, I have to see doctors, whether I™m
 sick or not, I mean you have to go and see 
doctors, blah blabber of all stripes. So you 
see people and you says, oh God almi ghty. You know, 

they -- they™r e really -- they™re really in a bad 
way, I mean, and they™re still clingi ng to life with 

everything they got. I ju
st don™t understand it.  
Q: Tell me , when you look at the war years, do y
ou think you mi ssed out on a lot because of it? 
A: Oh yes. I never had a youth. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
114 
 
 
A: From the time I was 17 until I was -- well, okay, I had a gi rlfri end in Fr ance, I tried to catch 
up a little bit. But for six years, forget it.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I mean, not only was I in horribl e places, you know, see I -- we can™t di scuss all the horrors in 

detail, we just have to gloss ove
r the whole thing. But when I thi
nk about all the th
ings or places, 
whatever happened to me, and the only way that
 I was able to handle 
it is because I was young. 
You have no concept of anything. That™s why w
hoever you send to fight a war is a young person. 
You don™t see 40 - 50 year old peop
le going in the front line, getting themselves shot up. You 
find 18 - 20 year old getting -- getting themselves k
illed. So it™s the same  thing with me . I didn't 
know any better. That™s the way it is, that™s th
e way it is. But I felt bad when I had time  to 
reflect, especially now, I says, 
gosh, I c -- I -- I couldn™t have survived six months under the 
conditions that I had to live. I mean, we discusse
d a lot of things but we omitted an awful lot of 
horror shows, you know. And that™s basically allI can say. But of course my [indecipherable] 
see, the ni ce thing is when I married Barbara,I had a ready ma de fa mily. Her mother, her father, 
her brother, relatives, grandmother, you know, things
 like that. So then I fe
lt like I sort of like, 
belonged. 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s important, that f
eeling. You know, all by yourself
 you™re floundering around, I mean, 
okay you™re alive, you eat, you do this, you do that and 
whatnot. But it™s not -- it™s the feeling -- 
belonging is very important to me , you know. A
nd so sh-she was just plain wonderful, you 
know. Great. On top of that, she was over nine years younger than me , which was a good thing 

in retrospect, because she died. She was 70 or
 71. So think about it, you know?  If she wouldn™t 
have been younger, what -- what kind of a nightma
re that would have -- 
and I could take care of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0511  
115 
 
 
her, wha -- you know, I took care of 
her all the rest of -- ever sinc
e the roof started caving in, you 
know?  She had the first open h
eart surgery in May of 1992, and the second one in December 
seventh, 19 -- yeah, 1993, in Houston by the 
biggest butcher known 
to mankind, Dr.Denton 
Cooley. Wh -Why do I s a y that? Because he works on an assembly line, he doesn™t take one 
patient at a time , he™s got five 
or six or seven scheduled for the 
day. So, if he has to do a little 
more that he didn™t si -- foresee, that
™s too bad for the patient, sew ‚em up. 
Q: Is there anything that we
 haven™t talked about that 
you think we must talk about? 
A: Do you reme mber anything that needs to be 
said?  I don™t know
. I mean, I -- what I can talk 
about is I have the most wonderful daughters 
and grandchildren. My two daughters, one is 49 
and one is 44. They haven™t given me, not as of
 late either, one mi nute of aggravation their 
whole lives. Now, who has a parent can say some
thing like that?  And I was a very straight 
fat her. 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You know, what™s that, tough love? 
Q: That™s what [indecipherable] 

A: Paid -- but the kids love me
. And my grandchildren, I walk on
