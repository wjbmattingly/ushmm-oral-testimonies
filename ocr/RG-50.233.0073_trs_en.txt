Abstract
Max
Liebmann
was
born
on
Se pte mber
3,
1921
in
Ma nnhei m,
Ger many
into
a
r elatively
com fortable
hous ehold
that
was
not
parti cularly
religious.
He
bega n
playing
the
cello
when
he
was
eight
yea r s
old
and
ha d
hopes
of
going
to
a
conservatory
in
Zurich
or
Jerusalem;
bu
t
this
be
came
impossible.
Max
a tte nde d
pu blic
scho ol
until
1937;
at
tha t
time
he
saw
no
sense
in
contin uing
at
school
due
to
the
harassment
he
experienced
as
a
Jew.
From
the
begin n i ng
of
1938
until
Kristallnacht,
he
atte nded
a
private
school.
His
mother
had
been
trained
as
a
concert
pi
anist,
and
his
father
was
in
the
textile
business.
In
193 8,
his
father
was
forced
to
give
up
his
business;
he
went
to
Greece
to
try
to
buil d
a
business
there.
Max
and
his
moth e r
moved
in
with
his
grand mother.
Fro m
Greece
his
father
ille gall
y
entered
France
an
d
remained
in
Nice
un til
the
end
of
the
war.
Max™s
mother
and
father
last
met
in
Italy
(o n
the
father™s
way
to
France )
in
August
1939;
his
moth er
returned
to
Ger many,
cer tain
that
there
would
be
no
war.

At
the
outbreak
of
th e
war
Max
was
called
to
perform
harvestin
g
work
in
East
Germany .
He
was
able
to
return
to
Mann heim
in
late
autumn
1939;
he
became
a
volunteer
for
emigr a tion
offices
in
Berlin.
He
worked
there
until
his
deportation
on
October
22,
1940
to
th e
non
r
occupied
zon e
of
Fr ance
Š
Gurs.
On
th e
trai
n
to
France
Ma
x
was
chosen
as
the
translator
for
the
Je wish
transpor t
leader .
On
a rrival
at
th e
camp,
he
was
separated
fro m
his
mother .
He
remained
at
Gurs
for
20
m o nths
during
which
ti me
he
worked
in
the
office
of
the
ca mp
block.
Because
he
played
musi c
Š
the
cello
Š
he
was
giv en
a
pass
tha
t
allowed
him
to
move
about
the
cam p
more
easily.
Thus,
he
was
able
to
see
hi s
mother
and
his
new
girlfrie nd
daily .

When
Max™s
block
was
clo s ed,
he
move d
into
th e
ho spital
of
the
camp
where
he
ran
the
office.
He
was
removed
from
the
camp
at
the
end
of
Jun
e
1942
by
the
Oeuvre
de
Se
cours
aux
Enfants
to
a
farm
outside
of
Lyon
run
by
the
Boy
Scouts
of
France.
He
was
able
to
say
‚go o dbye™
to
his
mother.
When
it
was
learned
that
a
raid
on
the
farm
was
planned,
th e
y
were
dispersed
and
told
to
fend
for
themselves.
With
the
help
of
Mirei lle
Philip,
he
was
giv en
sanctuary
on
another
farm
for
about
three
and
a
half
weeks.
He
was
the n
given
false
pa pe rs
and
be gan
a
trek
with
others,
climbi ng
up
over
the
mountains
into
Swi tzerland .
Af ter
about
half
an
hour
on
their
desce n
t
into
Switzerland ,
they
were
arrested
by
the
Swiss
pa tr ol
and
tol d
that
th ey
would
be
escorte d
back
to
Fran ce.
After
the
Swiss
patrol
left
the
group ,
Max
and
ano ther
man
tur ned
around
and
made
thei r
way
back
to

were
told
that

but
wou
l
d

in

He
remained

I
am
Anthony
Dilori o,
and
I™m
at
th
e
home
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Max
Liebmann,
In
Bayside,
Ne

Good
eveni n g.
Max,
could
you
ple ase
be gin
by
telli
ng
us
whe
n
you
were
born
and
where
you
grew
up.

I
was
born
on
Sep tember
3,
1921
in
Man nheim
in
Germany.
Mann heim
is
in
the
southwest
of
Germany .
My
parents,
who
also
were
bo rn
in
Ger man y,
were
Alfred
Liebmann
and
Jeanne,
née
Levi.
My
father
wa s
in
business
in
Mannhe im
as
a
representative
of
tex ti l e
firms.
To
be
more
specif ic,
he
represented
a
maker
of
co
tton
gray
goods
and
a
conv erter.
Those
were
the
two
compa nies
who
–
whom
he
represented
since
th e
twenties,
and
with
whom
he
was
until
he
coul d
no
longer
co ntinu e
working
in
Germany.
My
mother
was
basically
the
–
the
house wife.
Howeve r,
from
the
b eginni ng
or
from
the
mid dle
or
en
d
of
the
Depression
until
closing
of
the
busi ness,
she
di d
the
books
of
–
of
my
father™s
com pany
in
Ma nn heim;
and
th at
is
as
far
as
what
my
mother
di d.
My
mother
was
trained
originally
as
a
conc ert
piani s t;
however,
she
never
us ed
it
professionally.
Nevertheless,
she
played
a
lot
of
piano.
And
when
I
was
abl
e
on
the
cello
to
play
more
advanced
music
Š
such
as
sonatas,
etc.
Š
she
always
accompanie d
me.
And
we
also
played,
until
our
deportati o n,
quite
a
bi t
of
piano
–
chamber
music.
You
pl ayed
at
home,
had
a
pi an o,
an
d
you
wer
e
the
cellist?
[NOT E:
Interv iewer
and
Max
are
tal king
over
each
other.]

We
played
at
home;
we
had
a
–;
I
was
a
cellis t.
In
fact
Š
I
don™t
think
I
pu t
this
in
th e
videotape
Š
I
had
–
we
ha d
in
1939
a
Gentile
violinis t,
who
was
anti
r
Nazi,
who
came
to
our
house
un t
–
almost
un til
the
last
mi nu te
when
we
were
de porte d;
and
we
pla y ed
piano
tri o s
at
home.
My
father
wa s
Š
aside
from
his
business
Š
very
active
in
the
Jewish
Choral
Society
of
Ma nnhei m,
call e d
ﬁLiederkranzﬂ.
He
was
on
the
board
of
directors;
he
was
the
secretary.
And
he
was
e ssentially
res
p
onsible
for
getting,
among
other
things,
all
th e
tickets
prope r ly
organized
and
sold.
And
after
1934,
I
believe,
when
Jews
were
exclude d
from
the
cu ltural
life
in
Germany,
this
choral
society
beca me
what
was
know n
as
ﬁJuedischer
(Jüdischer )
Kul turbu nd,ﬂ
the
cul tural
orga
nization
of
th
e
Jewish
co m muni ty
in
Mannhei m.
In
addi tion
to
a
mi xed
choi r,
an
orchestra
was
founde d
Š
a
cha mb e r
orchestra.
And
until
abo ut
1937
there
were
concerts
of
ch oral
works;
there
wer e
co ncerts
of
th e
orchestra;
there
was
opera
performed.
We
did
an
Of fenbach
oper etta;
we
di d
Orpheus
and
Eur
–
Eur
–
Eurydice
by
Gl
uck;
we
did
Bastien
and
Bastienne
by
Mo zart;
toge ther
with
a
–
a
short
opera
Š
whose
name
escapes
me
right
now
Š
by
Pergolesi.
So
there
was
a
lar ge
cultural
lif e
in
Man nhei m,
which
unf ortunately
ha d
to
end
when
the
situation
be came
such
tha t
it
no
longer
coul
d
be
done
.

Your
father
Š
he
was
a
–
a
p hotogr a pher?
No.
My
father
was
–
my
fa ther,
as
I
said,
was
represe ntative
of
–
of
textiles.
And
in
19
–
the
begin ning
of
1938
when
he
had
to
giv e
up
his
busin ess
and
retur
n
th
e
–
and
turn
over
his
accoun ts
to
Gentiles,
one
of
his
companies
asked
hi m
if
he
w o uldn™t
want
to
try
to
build
up
an
e xiste nce
in
Gree ce .
So
in
March
of
193 8
my
father
went
to
Gree ce;
w hich
wa s
quite
an
enterprise
consi dering
tha t
le gally
he
could
not
take
out
more
than
ten
mark
s
from
Ger ma ny.
And
how
can
you
live
on
te n
marks?
So
he
managed
to
s muggl e
out
some
five
hun dred
or
a
tho usand
marks
which
he
tap ed
into
a
toilet
bowl
in
the
railroad
car,
until
he
was
across
the
border
in
Swi tzerland
when
he
retrieved
th
e
money.
My
father
started
to
bui
ld
an
existe nce
in
Gree ce .
However,
du e
to
interference
from
the
German
competition,
he
was
e xpell ed;
he
went
to
Italy.
And
fr om
Italy,
fro m
Ventimi gli a,
he
went
illegally
to
Fran ce.
After
the
usual
sto p
in
a
prison
for
illegally
entering
France ,
he
settle d
in
Nice.
At
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
was
interned
like
every body
who
wa s
of
Germa n
backgrou nd.
He
was
eventually
released
and
cam e
back
to
Ni ce
and
lived
in
Nice
until
the
–
ten
days
before
the
landing
of
the
American
troops
on
Fre nch
soil
when
he
was
arrested
when
he
was
accidentally
runnin
g
into
a
German
patr
ol.
My
moth e r
saw
my
father
the
last
ti me
in
August
of
1939
when
they
me t
in
Italy
when
he
was
on
hi s
way
to
Fran ce.
And
my
mother
was
so
convinced
that
no
war
would
bre a k
out
Š
des pite
all
of
the
signs
Š
that
she

returned
to
Germany;
eve n
thoug h
it
wo uld
have
bee n
easy
for
me
to
leave
Ger many
with
a
passport,
which
I
had
in
my
pock et,
and
join
the m
in
Italy.
At
least,
the n,
the
integri ty
of
the
family
would
have
been
preserv ed.
So
she
lef t
M ann heim
to
r endezvous
with
your
father
while
he
was
going
westwar
d
to
Fr ance
–

[NOT E:

–
Fran ce
–
and
came
back
just
a
few
days
before
he
went
to
Fran ce,
and
the
–
the
war
brok e
out.
So
the
–
the
possi bility
of
leaving
wa s
discussed,
bu t
her
–
she
wa
s
–
he
r
–
she
was
confident
enough
th at
it
wouldn ™t
be
too
danger ous
–
It
would
–
it
would
–
there
would
be
no
war.
No
war;
and
–
and

This
is
Au
gust
of
1939.
My
schooling
–
I
was
in
the
–
I
had
a
norma
l
schooling.
In
1928
I
started
pu blic
school.
In
Germany
you
go
–
went
to
public
s chool
for
four
years,
and
then
either
you
contin ued
publi c
school
for
another
four
years
and
beca me
a
tra desman,
or
you
transferred
after
four
year
s
into
high
s
chool;
which
I
did.
And
I
was
in
th e
Real gymna s ium,
which
meant
tha t
I
had
to
learn
first,
three
years
Latin.
Then
in
addition
to
Lati n,
a
year
of
–
we
started
with
French;
and
in
addi tion
to
French,
a
year
later
or
two
years
later,
we
started
with
Engl
ish.
So
I
had,
actually,
in
the
fir s t
year
of
hi g h
school
Š
which
was
the
fifth
year
of
school
Š
I
had
La tin.
So
did
I
the
same
for
th e
sixth
year;
in
the
seventh
year
I
had
Fre nch;
in
the
ei ghth
year
I
ha d
Latin,
Fren
ch,
and
English.

Were
yo
u
a
g ood
student?

I
was
a
good
studen t
until
it
dawn ed
on
me
that
ther e
is
no
sense
to
what
I
am
doing.
Aha;
whe n
di d
you
–?
When
I
realized
that
I
would
never
be
able
to
go
to
the
un
iversity
in
Germany;
and
when
I
stopped
really
studyi n g
at
home.
And
in
fact,
at
the
end
of
19 37,
I
told
my
parents
I
would
no
longer
continue
school
in
–
in
the
Realgymnasium.
Now,
it
seems
to
me
Š
and
thi s
was
something
which
I
di d
not
mention
in
the
videotape
Š
that
all
of
the
Jewish
children
who
were
in
school
in
Germany
from
1933
on
had
probl ems
which
our
paren ts
pr obably
were
not
even
awa re
of.
There
was
harassment
by
teachers;
th e r e
was
harassment
by
students
Š
which
was
part
of
our
daily
life.
And
it
wasn™t
fun
to
go
to
school
as
a
Ger
–
as
a
Jewish
kid
in
Germany.
And
it
probably
made
us
mu ch
older,
experi ence
r
wise;
and
mad e
us
more
streetwise
than
our
parents
ever
realized.
We
were
told
very
early
on:
Don™t
do
thi s
in
th e
str eet,
don™t
do
that
in
th e
str
eet.
And
it
–
it
helped
to
form
our
character
in
a
specific
way
without
us
being
aware
of
it.
I
know
thi s
now
in
retr ospect;
and
at
the
end
of
™37
I
de cid e d
there
is
no
sense
in
my
continuin g
to
go
to
school.
And
so
we
made
a
compr o mise
in
193
8.
From
the
b eginni ng
of
1938
to
Kristallnacht,
I
went
to
a
private
com mercial
school
wher e
I
had
Englis h;
I
had
some
Fren ch;
I
learned
Ger man
steno
Š
what
for
I
stil l
don™t
know
because
it
was
obvious
tha t
we
wouldn™ t
be
able
to
do
anything
in
Ger many
Š
bu t
I
learned
German
steno.
And
after
the
Kristallnacht
we
coul
d
no
longer
go
to
s chool.
So
for
the
begi nnin g
–
from
begi nning
of
193 9
on
un til
the
war
broke
out
I
was
at

home
reading
books
Š
one
or
two
books
a
day
Š
not
always
the
best
literatur e,
but
I
read.
And
I
played
music
to
the
extent
that
this
was
still
possible.
Actually
I
pla y ed
music
fro m
1930
on
when
I
started
to
–
™ 31.
I
started
when
I
was
ei ght
years
old
Š
so
that
would
be
1929;
I
started
my
cello
lessons.
And
eventually
I
join
e
d
a
chil dr en™s
orchestra;
I
was
in
the
school
orchestra
un til
I
could
no
longer
be
par t
of
this.
I
pla y ed
chamber
music;
I
stil l
play
cham ber
music
today.
In
–

12:31
Your
mother
must
have
b
een
pr oud
of
your
musical
career.
Well,
in
–
the r e
was
a
qu estion
in
–
in
1 938,
if
I
could
go
ei ther
to
Zurich
to
con tinue
my
studies
at
the
conservatory
in
Zurich,
which
was
denie d
be cause
I
couldn™t
get
a
visa.
And
the n
in
1939
th e r e
was
a
question
if
I
could
go
to
Isra
el
to
–
to
–
to
conservatory
in
Jerusalem.
But
my
uncle
and
a unt
who
lived
in
–
in
–
in
Palestine
since
1934
de cide d
th ey
did
not
have
the
means
to
support
this;
so
nothing
cam e
of
this.
Thus,
I
never
be came
a
professional
musicia n
.
Is
th
at
something
you
wa n ted
to
be?

It
was
a
possibility;
I
proba bly
had
enough
tal ent
to
do
it.
It
s oun ds
th a t
your
par e n t s
would
have
pref erre d
th at
you
stay
at
sch ool.
You
–
you
suggested
–
Yes;
of

–
–
that
th ey
–
that
th ey
wo
uld
have
wan

you
to
conti nue
even
af ter
193 7
–

That
was
–
yes,
yes;
of
co urse.
But
th er e
was
–.
I
co uld
have
gon e
to
high
school
until
Kristallnacht
which
is
Nov ember
10,
1938,
when
we
were
legislated
out
of
school.
And
I
wa nt
to
add
tha t
I
was
able
to
go
to
r e
gul
ar
Germa n
school
as
long
as
I
did,
be cause
my
father
was
a
front
line
veteran
of
World
War
I.

So
this
exem pted
you
from
som e
of
th e
–
This
exempte d
me
from
so me
of
the
restrictions
which
were
impos ed
on
other
Jewish
students
whose
father
were
not
veterans
of
World
War
I.

Now
earli er
yo
u
–
yo
u
we re
d escribing
the
home
life.
You
were
talking
about
the
pian o.
Your
mother
play e d
the
piano
–
Well
–
–
at
hom e ;
you
playe d
th e
cello
–

Obviously,
since
my
paren ts
both
were
born
in
Mannheim
an
d
li
ved
in
Man nhei m,
th ere
was
a
very
large
cir cle
of
friends;
which,
of
course,
during
th e
19 30™s
eventual ly
be came
s m aller,
when
the
emigration
started
in
earnest.
But
my
parents
had
a
very
large
cir cle
of
frie nds.
My
father
was
very
active.
Besides
being
in
th e
–
in
this
cho r al
society
on
the
board
of
directors,
he
also
was
a
member
of
the
elective
Š
how
ca n
I
call
this?
Š
of
the
ele
c
tive
body
who
ra n
th e
Jewish
commu ni
–
comm
–
the
Jewish
comm unity
in
Man nheim .
There
were
two
lev els;
ther e
wa s
the
ele ctive
body
out
of
which
emanated
the
so
r
called
Board
which
ra n
th
e
day
r
to
r
day
operatio ns.
I
think
my
father
was
requeste d
to

join
this
board
in
1934/1935;
that
was
called
Synago genrat.
But
he
de cline d
because
he
felt
he
was
not
steeped
enough
and
reli gious
enough
fr om
th e
Jewish
viewpoint
to
be
par t
of
this.
Ho w
wo uld
you
describ e
your
religi ous
life
and
th e
religious
life
of
your
fami ly?
We
always
kn ew
we
were
Jews;
I
was
ba r
mitzvah,
which
was
a
big
affair
Š
in
19
34,
when
I
was
thirte en.
But
we
were
not
religious
in
th e
sense
that
r eligion
played
a
daily
role
in
our
life .
Th e
more
religious
part
of
my
fa mily
was
the
–
my
–
the
aunt
–
my
aunt
and
her
hu
sband.
The
sister
of
my
mother
was
married
to
a
man
who
kep t
more
of
Judaism
at
ho me .
Th e
–
the
–
they
ke pt
religious
holidays.
I
wa s
always
with
the m
on
Sed er,
and
I
di d
spend
a
good
–.
They
were
childless;
the refore,
I
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
w eekends
with
my
uncle
and
my
aunt
unt
il
their
emigr a tion
in
1934
to
Palestine.

Which
synag ogue
was
your
family
affiliated
with?
199;
16:40
We
–
my
–
my
family,
as
well
as
my
aunt™s
family
be longed
to
what
was
th e
li beral
part
of
the
congregation .
In
Ma nnhei m
there
we
r
e
two
synagog ues
[N OTE:
H a upt
(Main)
S y nagogue
and
Klaus
Synagogue] .
One
was
calle d
[?
unin telli g ible]
synagog ue,
which
wa s
from
what
we
look
at
Š
as
we
look
at
it
tod a y
Š
was
a
conservative
service.
In
addition
we
had
in
Mannhe im
the
so
r
call ed
Klaus,
which
was
a
strictly
orthodox
service.
Actually,
the
only
difference
betwee
n
the
two
services
was
the
absence
of
a
organ
in
the
orthodox
por tion
of
the
co ngregation .
The
services
were
otherwis e
ide nti cal;
and
I
would
assume
that
the
con gregati ons
were
spli t
about
40
per
cen t
orthodox
and
60
per cent
conservative.
It
was
–
it
was
always
assumed
by
outsiders
tha
t
Ge rman
Jews
were
not
religi o us.
I
think
that
is
a
–
to
a
large
extent
a
my th.
I
beli eve
tha t
at
le ast
35
to
40
per
ce nt
of
all
families
–
Je wish
families
in
Mannhei m,
ha d
kosher
hou s eholds.
We
did
no t.
In
S e ptem ber
of
1 939,
at
th
e
ou
tbreak
of
the
war,
we
were
call ed
to
–
to
th e
Wehrmacht
to
be
mustered
out,
be cause
under
Ger ma n
law,
Jews
could
not
serve
in
the
army;
even
thoug h
I
believe
th ere
was
a
par a graph
in
th is
regulation
that
you
could
be
drafted
for
war time
service.
You
were
–
this
time
you
wo
uld
be
eig hte en.
At
this
ti me
I
was
eighteen,
and
all
of
my
peers,
of
course,
were
ca lled
up
for
service.
And
shortly
thereafter,
I
was
called
to
perform
harv esting
work
in
East
Germany.
Due
to
th e
mobili zatio n
of
the
–
the
Ger man
–
the
men,
there
was
a
shortage
of
–
of
harvesting
labor;
so
I
was
sent
to
a
far
m
Š
not
to
a
farm
Š
to
a
village
east
of
Frankfur
t
on
th e
Oder
in
East
German y.
And
I
belie ve
I
was
ther e
for
about
six
weeks
har v esting
potatoes
and
suga r
bee ts
and
red
beets.
And
at
that
ti me
,
of
course,
it
was
a
concern
of
my
mother
if
I
would
be
per mitted
to
co me
ba ck
hom e
to
Mann hei m
after
this
was
over,
because,
after
all,
Man nhe im
was
close
to
the
Fre nch
border.
And
the
a ttack
in
1940
by
the
German
forces
on
Fra nce,
Holland,
and
Belgi
u
m
hadn™t
started
yet.
I ndee d ,
after
the
harvest
was
in,
I
was
permitted
to
back
–
go
ba ck
to
Germany;
to
Mann he im,
and
–.

This
was
in
the
late
autumn
–
241;
19:58
It
was
in
–
in
the
la te
autumn
of
1939,
and
my
moth er
was
able
to
arrange
then,
that
starting
on
January
the
2
nd
,
I
would
be
working
for
the
emigration
arm
in
–
in
Mann heim .
In
fact,
th e
emigration
services
Š
w hich
you
coul d
call
th e
equivalent
of
the
HIAS
here
in
the
Uni ted
States
Š
were
run
by
th e
official
Jewis h
representation
–
again
[?]
–
vis
r
à
r
vis
the
Ger man
government .
It
was
called
Reichsvertretung
der
Jude
n
in
Deuts
chl and;
and
the
emigration
offices
were
co ntrolled
out
of
Berlin.
Therefore,
at
the
end
of
19 39,
I
had
to
go
overnight
by
train
to
Berl in;
which
was
no
pleasure,
because

there
had
be en
mi nor
raids
already
Š
n i ghtly
at
–
at
Germany,
from
Englan d
and
from
Fran ce.
I
went
to
Berlin
over night.
I
prese nted
myself
at
the
emigrati on
offices
in
Berlin
to
be
i nterviewe d
by
the
head
of
the
office,
which
I
believ e
was
–
his
name
was
Loe wenstein.
I
u nderstand
he
was
later
kill ed
in
a
bombing
raid
by
the
Englis
h.
I
was
accepted
as
a
volunteer
emplo yee.
I
was
sent
ba ck
th e
same;
and
I
went
back
the
ne xt
nigh t
–
–
to
Mann
–
–
to
Man nhe im.
And
I
started
on
Jan uary
2
nd
or
3
rd
to
work
as
a
sec
–
secretary
in
th is
office.
And
I
was
there
un til
our
deportation
every
day
w o rking
as
a
secretary,
eve n
though
I
was
considered
a
volunteer;
w hich
mean t
I
had
a
–
a
pocket
money
of
50
marks
a
month.

Did
you
live
with
your
mother?

I
lived
at
hom e
with
my
mo
ther.

S
upp or ted
her,
I
imagine.
She™d
b een
li ving
al one
so
thi s
must
have
bee n
good
that
you
came
back.
Of
course,
it
was
very
good
tha t
I
ca me
back.
‚Caus e
how
was
she
su pp orti ng
herself?

Well,
we
had
–
well
Š
because
of
th e
fa
ct
that
my
father
had
left
Germany
Š
we
gave
up
our
apartment
in
19
–
Marc h
or
April
of
193 8
and
moved
in
with
my
–
into
the
apartment
of
my
grandmother ,
who
owns
a
house.
There fore,
we
did
–
di d
no t
hav e
to
pay
rent;
which
reduced
living
expenses.
And,
so
we
ma
n
a ged
to
survive
somehow.
Un til
–
and
I
worked,
as
I
s a id,
in
–
in
this
office
until
th e
22
nd
of
Octob er
1 940
when
we
were
deported.

Ho w
did
th at
come
ab ou t?

Well,
on
Octo ber
21
st
around
10
o™clo ck,
the
tele pho ne
rang
in
th e
office.
And
the
Gestapo
was
on
the
phone
becau s e
the
head
of
the
emigrati on
office
in
Mann heim
also
was
a
cont act
betwe en
the
Jewish
commu nity
and
the
Gesta po .
He
went
to
the
office
of
the
Gestapo
almost
wee k ly,
and
he
wa s
told
to
come
down
immedia
t
ely.
And
when
he
came
down
Š
and
that
was
really
a
co urtesy
of
the
Mann heim
Gestapo
Š
he
was
told
th at
we
would
be
arrested
and
depo rted
the
next
morning.
But
we
would
be
sh
–
shipped
over
th e
de mar cation
li ne
into
–
into
the
so
r
called
non
r
occupi ed
zon
e
of
Fran ce.
Well,
he
came
back
ar ound
11
o™clo ck;
he
–
he
notified
the
he ad
of
th e
Jewish
congre gation
in
Mannheim.
And
we
closed
th e
office
around
12
o™clo ck.
We
went
all
home.
There
was
no
way
of
really
notify ing
anybody
be cause
private
homes
in
–
in
–
in
Ger ma n y
Š
Jewish
private
hom
e
s
Š
could
no
longer
possess
telephones.
So
when
I
cam e
ho me,
I
first
ha d
to
fi ght
with
my
moth er
who
–
wa
–
thought
I
was
kiddin g
her.
Sh e
could
not
bel ieve
that
wha t
I
say
–
what
I
wa s
saying
–
said
we
would
be
moved
out
of
Mannh eim
Š
depor
t
ed,
so
to
speak,
the
ne xt
morning
Š
could
be
tru e.

302;
24:29
Were
you
given
a
reason
whe n
they
announced
this?
Was
there
a
reas on
giv en
for
this
de por tation?

[NOT E:
Interv iewer
and
Max
talki ng
over
each
other.]
No
reason
Š
the
Gaule
iter
ordered
it
–
and
you
kno
w
–
the
hea
d
of
the
–
the
Nazi
head
of
the
state.
And
that
was
good
enough.

The
ti ming
Š
was
the r e
any,
as
far
as
you
could
tell?
Was
there
any
reason
for
th at
partic ular
tim e?
I
beli eve
the
–
there
was
a
–
one
prior
action
befor e
we
were
de ported;
and
that
was
in
St ettin
(Sz cze cin ).
Th e
Jews
of
Ste t tin
were
moved,
were
dep o rted
east,
I
believe,
in
August
of
1940.
And
so
the
Nazi
hea d
of
Baden
wanted
to
be
the
first
one
who
really
wanted
to
empty
out
his
entir e
state.
And
then
the
Gaulei ter,
the
Nazi
head
of
the
nei ghbo ring
Pfalz
(Palatinate),
was
the
next
one
who
joined.
So
thi s
was
a
comb ined
ac
t
ion
of
these
two
men
to
get
rid
of
their
Jews.
Local
zeal.

Local
zeal.
When
I
procee ded
the n
to
pull
out
and
look
at
suitcases
what
we
co uld
take
along,
be cause
I
kn ew
we
were
–
we
were
told
by
the
Gestapo
tha t
we
can
only
take
what
we
can
carry
plu s
a
hundre
d
marks
a
person.
So
when
my
mother
realize d
tha t
I
was
serious,
and
I
was
going
thr o ugh
all
of
the
sample
cases
of
my
fa ther,
because
they
would
lend
the mselves
better
to
be
packed
and
handl ed,
she
realize d
that
I
was
serious.
And
she
finally
started
to
cooperate,
and
we
–
we
indeed
wer
e
fully
packe
d
by
nig htfall
Š
at
w hich
ti me
my
mother
got
a
confirmation
of
–
of
what
I
had
told
her;
beca use
our
former
h a ndyman
in
our
apartment
sneaked
in
the
house
when
it
was
dar k
to
alert
us
to
the
fact
that
he
had
heard
tha t
we
would
be
de p o rted
the
next
morni ng.

This
was
a
Gentile?

It
was
a
Gen ti l e
Š
who
was
a
very
de ce nt
guy
Š
and
who
–
who,
while
we
wer e
living
in
our
own
apartment,
came
every
da y
Š
in
winter
particularly
Š
to
ge
t
the
coal
from
the
cellar
up
to
ou
r
apartment
fo
r
what
we
ne eded
overnight
and
for
the
ne xt
day.
So
he
came
either
once
or
twice
a
day
Š
for
which
he
got
paid
of
course
Š
to
bring
our
coal
up.
Th e
next
morning
indeed,
around
8:30
or
9
o™clock,
our
bell
rang,
and
there
wer e
tw
o
Gestapo
men
.
I
don™t
kn ow
if
th ey
were
Ges tapo
or
crimi n
–
criminal
police;
bu t
in
any
case,
they
ca me.
They
told
us
that
in
th e
name
of
the
Fü hrer
we
were
arrested;
we
have
an
hour
to
pack.
We
didn™t
tell
them
that
we
were
packed
already.
And
they
would
be
ba
ck
in
an
hour
Š
which
really
turne d
out
to
be
two
or
three
hours.
And
the n
we
were
told
what
we
kn ew
Š
that
we
coul d
take
100
mar ks
a
person
and
wha tever
we
can
carry;
and
we
should
be
ready.
And
whe
n
they
cam
e,
they
led
us
to
the
–
I
believe
it
was
fir s t
the
Mannh eim
Castle
where
we
were
assembled;
which
was
only
a
–
a
few
blocks
fr om
where
we
lived.
And
fr om
there,
another
few
blocks
to
th e
main
railway
station
from
where
there
were
regular
fourth
r
class
–
four
–
four th
r
class
passenger
ca rs
waiting
in
a
train.
And
we
were
loaded
up
on
this
train.

363;
28:51
One
trai n
–
or
the r e
wer e
others?
There
were
a
total
of,
I
thin k,
nine
trains
altogether
w hich
went
fro m
Mannh eim
and
various
other
points
in
Baden
and
the
Pfalz
[NOT
E:
and
th e
Saar
Š
added
later
by
Mr.
Lieb ma nn.]
Ho w
many
were
you
in
M ann heim?

Well,
in
Man nheim
at
the
time,
I
be liev e,
we
wer e
about
three
and
a
half
thous a nd
Jews.
The
total
deportation
numb er,
which
is
officially
assumed
as
being
correct,
is
6,504
per s
ons.
The
pe
ople
who
were
not
de p o rted
were
mostly
mixe d
marriages,
and
a
few
isolated
cases
where
people
ma naged
to
escape
depor tation
becaus e
somebody
in
th e
family
was
too
sick
to
be
transported.
By
and
la rge,
th ey
did
no t
consider
illness
a
reason
not
to
be
depo rted.

To
your
knowledg e,
did
anyone
ref use
to
comply
wi th
th e
orde r?
Well,
th ere
were
a
numb er
of
people
who
commi tte d
–
com
–
a
nu mber
of
peop le
committed
suicide.

Anyone
tha t
you
knew?

Nobody
I
kne w ,
but
I
think
my
wife
kne w
so
–
some
people
who
did.
In
Karlsruhe?
No
Š
in
Ma
n
nheim
.
Mann heim.

Ya;
there
were
five
or
six
or
seven
suicides
in
Mannheim.

Did
any one
try
to
violate
the
or ders
Š
for
ex ample ,
th e
100
mark?
There
were
a
numb e r
of
people
who
had
enough
guts
to
defy
this.
And
eve n
tho ugh
the
SS,
when
they
came
on
the
train,
thr eate
ned
us
with
dire
reprisals
if
they
would
find
peop
le
with
more
than
a
hundre d
marks,
a
nu mber
of
people
ma naged
to
ge t
out
more
tha n
a
h undre d
marks;
and
of
course,
they
were

they
had
that

in

Were

No,
no.
You
ar en™ t
one
of
the
sneaky

No;
look
Š
German
Jews
basically
were
very
–
Ger m an.
We
did n™t
do
things
we
weren™t
supposed
to
do.
So
we
did
not
Š
even
though
there
was
more
mo ney
in
the
ho
use.
And
whil
e
my
moth er
was,
of
course,
prese r ving
money
Š
since
th er e
was
no
more
income
since
th e
end
of
1937
Š
we
had
more
money
in
the
house
than
just
a
few
hundred
marks.
And
by
and
la rge
we
all
ca me
from
a

backgrou nd.
My
father
–
in
fact
I
was
very
much
surprised
when
after
th e
war,
when
the
res titution
of
business
with
the
German
governmen t
started,
when
I
saw
earni ng
figures
of
my
father.
It
was
much
higher
than
I
had
ever
kno w n.
So
you
were
–
you
were
leading
a
rather
comfortable
–

We
were

We
had
a
maid.
Until
I
was
six
years
old,
I
had
a
n a nny;
and
which
I
fired,
so
to
speak.
I
told
my
parents
categori cally
that
when
I
go
start
school
Š
and
I
was
only
fiv e
th en,
five
and
a
half
Š
when
I
would
start
school,
there
would
be
no
more

I™ m
too
old
to
have
a

and
i ndeed
the
nanny
was
di scontinu ed
when
I
went
to
first
class
in
19
–
in
–
on
Easter
of
192 8.
So
your

was
a
rather
successful

My
father
had
a
rather
successful
business.
And
whil
e
he
was
absent
a
great
deal,
he
always
managed
to
be
–
he
always
was
home
over
the
weekends.
He
always
arranged
his
sche dule
so
that
when
there
were
board
meeti ngs
at
his
beloved
Li ederkranz,
he
was
home
for
that
period .
There
we
re
very
few
sessions
he
missed;
and
basically
we
li ved
a
very
co mfortable
lif e .
Th ere
was
a
maid
in
the
hous e;
we
had
even
a
maid
un til
the
begin ning
of
the
war.
After
the
–
after
the
–
at
one
time
th ere
was
a
law
passed
where
you
could
no
longer
have
maids
under
45
in
Jewish
households
with
males.

The
Nuremberg
Laws.
Yeah,
that
wa s
part
of
the
Nurem berg
Laws.
And
we
really
were
very
lucky
we
had,
all
throu ghout
my
growing
up
in
Man nhei m
–
we
ha d
very
few
maids.
Our
maids
usually
left
only
because
they
got
married
and
started
to
have
their
own
families.
We
were
very
lu
ck
y
to
la tch
onto
a
woman
in
her
middle
or
late
fifties
when
this
law
was
passed;
and
she
stayed
with
us
practi cal ly
to
the
end.

Ho w
ab ou t
your
non
r
Jewish

Did
–
wa

–
ho
w
would
you

be tween
you
and
your
f am ily
on
the
on e
hand
and
non
r
Jews
the r e
in
the
peri od
from
Kristallnacht
to
dep ortati on?

Numb er
one,
my
parents
had
very
few
non
r
Jewish
fri ends.
There
were
busi ness
conne ctions .
My
father
knew
a
lot
of
peopl e,
of
course,
and
so
did
my
mother
be
cause
they
both
grew
up
in
Mann heim .
But
our
social
circ le
was
Je wish.
Jewish.

It
was
not
–

Yours
as
well ?
Mine
as
well.
I
kn ew,
of
co urse,
in
school
a
lot
of
Ge ntile
boys
Š
all
my
classmates.
I
was
–
in
–
when
I
–
in
hi
gh
s
c
hool
there
were
only
four
Je ws
in
a
class
of
thirty.
And
later
on
when
th e
class
split,
th ere
were
four
Je ws
in
a
class
of
twenty
r
one.
And
that
e v entually
reduced
itself
as
Jews
and
–
two
of
the
boys
emigrated.
There
wa s
no
con
t
act
other
than
in
school.
Howe ver,
coming
back
to
–
in
ea rly
thirties
when
I
started;
I
started
high
school
in
1932
when
I
was
in
fifth
grade
Š
which
mea nt
I
was
te n
years
old.
So on
after
when
–
when
Hi tl er
started
Š
in
Jan uary
of
1933
Š
of
co urse
th
e
–
the
frictions
came.
Th e
bo ys
slowly,
but
surely,
started
to
becom e
uniformed
and
had
to
join
the
–
the
Jungvolk
Š
the
youth
groups.
And
la te r
on,
the
–
they
switched
over
to
the
up per
grade
of
the
youth,
and
th ere
were
all
the
–
there
was
some
harassment.
In
fact
I
rem
e
mber
tha t
we
went
–
in
hig h
school
it
was
customary
to
go
for
one
w eekend
Š
th e
whole
class
Š
on
a
excur s ion.
In
our
school
it
was
customary
to
go
to
a
youth
hostel
in
the
Ode nwal d
which
was
not
too
far
away
from
Ma
nnhei
m,
which
was
a
low
range
of
mou ntains.
And
when
it
started
ther e
again,
you
know,
that
th ey
haras s ed
me,
I
pick ed
on
a

boy
which
I
fi gured
I
could
handle,
and
I
really
beat
hi m
into
a
pulp
and
without
conseque nce s .
The
class
surrounded
us,
and
we
–
we
fou ght
it
out;
and
when
I
finally
was
the
wi nner,
the
harassment
stopped;
not
only
for
me,
but
for
every body
else
who
was
Jewish
in
my
class.
And
from
the
n
on,
th
e
existence
was
very
normal .
We
were
part
of
the
–
of
the
class,
and
nobody
ever
started
to
har ass
us
again.
In
fact,
throug h
most
of
my
hig h
s chool
life
duri ng
gy mnasti cs
Š
we
had
gymnastics
twi ce
a
week
Š
when
it
cam e
to
playing
soccer
Š
and
so
it
h a
ppene
d
that
my
class
had
outstandi ng
soccer
team
who
m a naged
to
be at
mu ch
older
classes
Š
I
always
was
the
referee.
Was
perfectl y
normal
–
that
I
was
call ed
out
imme diately.
I™m
the
referee
Š
I
wasn™t
a
go od

pla y er;
I
wasn™t
interested
in
soccer,

Now,
ho
w
ab
out
your
neig hbor s ,
as
you
we re,
pri or
to
the
de por t ati on?

There
was
no
real
con tac t.
I
mean,
my
mother
went
s hopping,
and
we
kn ew
the
tradesmen .
And
we
were
all
–
th ere
was
alwa ys
enough
food
even
after
ther e
was
a
r
estriction
on
the
purchasin
g
hours.
I
believe
it
started
after
–
after
Kristall
nacht.
There
were
–
all
of
a
s udden
there
appeared
signs
in
every
store
in
Man nheim
that
Je ws
could
only
pur chase
fro m
one
to
two.
And
after
rationing,
we
always
had
enough
food
because
with
–
the
peopl e
–
the
tradespeople
knew
us;
and
we
we
r
e
given .
My
moth er
always
managed
to
ge t
so mewhat
mor e
tha n
she
was
entitl ed
to
by
the
rationing
cards.
But,
as
I
said,
we
had
no
no n
r
Jewish
frie nds.

Friends,
acqu aintances
–?

Acquain tance s
Š
yes.
And
as
I
said,
I
pla y ed
music
with
a
non
r
Jewish
violinist.
Right.

But
basically
we
had
no
–

He
wa
s
an
ex cepti on
–

He
was
an
exception
rather
than
th e
rule.
What
seemed,
in
your
view,
th e
–
the
–
the
recepti on
th at
these
pe ople
gave
whe n
you
we re
being
par ade d
ou t?
I
mean,
what
is
your
sens
e
of
what
the
ot
her
Germans
were
thinking?
Well,
it
was
well
known
that
there
was,
in
the
high e s t
governme nt
circle,
con cern
that
the
population
would
not
go
along
too
well
with
Jewish
persecutions .
And
I
believ e
tha t
the
firs t
ti me
that
they
felt
certain
enough
that
ther e
would
be
no
serious
adverse
reaction
was
at
the
Kristallnacht.
But
otherwise
I
beli
eve
ever ything
was
done
so
that
the
majority
of
the
popula ti o n
was
not
made
too
aware
tha t
there
were
th ings
going
on
against
Jews
Š
except
for
the
boycott
in
April
of
1933
[interjection
by
his
wife:
ﬁKristallnacht!ﬂ]
and
Kristallnacht.
And
then,
of
course,
as
th e
signs
in
the
windows
where
–
of
the
stores
w h ereby
you
co uld
only
shop
at
certain
ti mes.
And
we
were
not
per mitted
–
[interjection
by
his
wif e:
ﬁthe
coffee
sho ps,
the
restaurantsﬂ]
we
were
not
per m itted
to
go
to
movies
and
the
restaurants,
coffee
shops.
There
wer
e
si
gns
up:
ﬁJews
are
not
desir ed
here.ﬂ

The
morning
tha t
you
were
marched
to
th e
station
Š
was
th at
a
we eken d
or
a
weekd ay?
It
was
a
w eekday.

Weekd ay.
And
there
wa s
no
reaction
from
the
population.

Peo ple
we re
on
th e
street;
I
mean
you
must
have
made
a
pre tty
big
spectacle.

No;
be cause
we
were
led
to
the
–
to
the
assembly
points
indivi du ally.
In
other
words,
there
would
have
bee n
a
group
of
–
in
my
case,
I
be l
ieve,
ther
e
were
my
moth er
and
I,
and
there
were
two
people
who
lived
with
us
from
far
–
dis tant
rela tives
who
came
to
us
fro m
a
–
a
town
in
the
Palati nate
Landau.
So,
there
wer e
fo ur
people,
who
with
th eir
baggages,
wa lked
with
two
other
guys.
We
were
not
like
in
–
we
had
no
handcuffs.

You
weren™t
tha
t
c
ons picu ous.

We
were
very
inconspi cuo us.

Then,
at
the
meeti ng
point
Š
how
many
were
you?
A
thousand?
I
don™t
–
I
must
te ll
you,
I
do
not
re me mber.
If
we
were
individually
led,
I
beli eve
I
said,
we
were
le
d
to
the
Man
nhei
m
Castle,
which
was
not
too
far
away
from
th e
–
fro m
the
railway
station.
Now
if
were
led
dir ectly
to
the
railway
station,
I
don ™ t
recall.
But
we
were
not
–
it
was
not
conspicuous.
There
wer e
no
–
the
peo ple
di d
not
react
ei ther .

41:39
Were
th
ere
gu
ards
for
the
most
par t?
Yeah
Š
bu t
the
guards
we aring
not
unif o rms;
it
was
all
done
in
civ ilian
clot hes.
So
we
were
loaded
on
the
trains,
and
th e
SS
cam e
to
tell
us
that
we
should
not
dare
to
take
more
tha n
100
marks
Š
beca use
we
would
be
searched.
And
th
en
eventually
th e
SS
–
an
SS
officer
came
back
again
and
was
looking
for
a
transport
–
Jewish
trans port
lead
–
le ader.
And
it
so
happen ed
that
a
man
wa s
pick ed
who
was
in
my
co mpart ment
on
my
train;
it
was
whom
we
kne
w
.
So
when
the
ti me
cam e
in
France,
when
the
French
in
Lyo n
wanted
to
talk
to
somebody
beca use
they
didn™ t
know
who
we
were
and
what
was
going
on,
the y
weren™t
tol d
in
advance.
I
came
down
with
th e
man
as
a
transla tor
beca use
he
kn ew
me;
I
played
music
with
hi
m.
An
d
it
tur ned
out
that
the
Fren ch
were
totally
ig norant
of
what
was
going
on.
And
we
e xplaine d
to
a
French
colonel
of
the
Gen darmerie
tha t
we
were
Ge rman
Jews,
not
Alsatians
as
they
had
assumed;
and
the y
were
really
dum mkopf
[? ]
–
du mbfou nded.
They
had
no
preparation;
they
wer
e
not
aware
that
what
–
who
was
coming,
how
many
were
com ing;
they
were
just
–
we
were
just
dum p ed.
Even tuall y ,
the
train
–
or
the
trains
–
we
were
–
I
happ ened
to
be
in
the
first
train.
First
of
th e
ni ne.

–
of
the
nine;
and
eventually
we
we
r
e
–
we
wer e
giv en
some
food
to
eat
by
th e
Fren ch
Red
C ross.
The
man
who
was
speaking
and
I,
who
–
who
were
speaking
with
th e
Gen darmerie ,
were
fed
by
the
Gen darmerie
Š
which
was
the
first
ti m e
I
made
the
acquain tance
of
pâté .
I
do n™t
kn
ow
wha
t
the
rest
of
the
train
was
given.
I
ha d
pâté
and
br ead;
and
th e n
we
were
pu t
ba ck
on
th e
train.

Were
you
all owe d
to
get
off
the
tr ain?

Yeah.

Yeah.
The
two
of
us
were
off
the
train.
We
wer e
th e
only
ones
off
the
trai n.

The
only
tw o .

And
eve ntual ly
the
train
went
on.
And
I
think
we
wer e
on
the
train
betw een
th e
22
nd
of
October
to
the
24
th
–
or
25
th
of
October
when
we
arri
–
when
we
finally
ende d
up
in
a
small

call ed
Oloron
r
Sainte

which
was
about
15
or
so
kilome ters
fr om

And
there
were
tru cks
Š
open
trucks
Š
wai ting;
and
we
were
tru ck ed
from
the
rail way
station
to
the
cam p
entrance.
When
we
came
to
the
ca mp
entrance,
it
was
raining
cats
and
dogs.
It
was
ni ght;
and
we
were
led
somewhere
and
fed
into
barracks
about
30
or
–
we
were
50,
60
Š
each
barrack
was
f illed.
Me n
and
women
were
separated.
Our
luggage
was
dump e d
in

of
the

in

and
we
we

At
this

I
was
separated
from
my
mother.
I
was
in
one
of
the
men™s

and
my
mother
was
one
of

At

And

Who
we
re
your
guards?

Our
guards
when
we
arrived
were
Fren ch
Gendarm er ie
Š
uniformed
Fre nch
Ge ndarmerie .
When
we
came
into
th e
barracks,
all
we
wer e
giv en
was
some
straw
and
one
mili tary
issue
vessel
for
the
food;
with
a
spoon,
fork,
knife
[i nterjection
by
his
wife:
ﬁNot

The
first

The n
eventually
we
were
give n
th e
vessel
and
some

Š
one
vessel.
And
eventually,
you
know,
a
ki tche n
service
was
establis hed
with
wha tever
li ttle
food
the
Fren ch
were
provi ding
us.
It
wa s
a
distinctio n
of
Gurs
that
food
was
always
in
short
supply.
And
what
is
more,
and
we
found
this
out
only
in
retrospect,
ther e
was
a
good
deal
of
corruption.
And
not
all
the
mon
ey
which
were
–
was
s upposed
to
be
used
for
our
–
our
food
was
really
spent
beca use
a
lot
went
into
some
pock ets.
Which
meant
that
our
food
was
ne ver
more
than
about
five,
six
hu ndred
calories
a
day .
In
the
French
pocke ts?

You
mentioned
th at
th ere
we re
French
guards
at
the
camp.
Who
guarded
the

acros
s?

Well,
un
til
–
until
we
went
into
the
uno ccu pied
zone
of
France,
it
was
the
SS.
After
that
ther e
was
really
nobody
on
the
train.
But
wher e
were
we
suppo sed
to
go?
Th ere
mi ght
ha ve
–
ther e
was
French
personnel
on
the
train,
but
I
don™ t
think
we
were
really
guarded
.
Th ere
were
only
very
few
escapes.
So
to
come
back
Š
the
barracks
were
bare;
ther e
was
a
stove
in
the
barrack.
We
never
had
a
sufficient
amount
of

materia l;
so
it
was
co ld.
Water
wa s
rationed

in

–
in
thi s
area
was
in
short
s upply,
and
there
wasn™t
e
n
ough
for
the
camp
to
go
a r ound.
We
came
with
about
six
and
a
half
thousand
people.
At
the
end
of
th is
week,
a cco rding
to
statis tics
available,
ther e
were
1 0,000

in

There fore,
there
were
about
thr e e
and
a

before

We
were

Eventually,
the
Spanish
interne es,
which
had
a
mu ch
mor e
leni ent
regime
Š
they
could
move
further
around
the
ca mp,
they
coul d
ge t
out
of

they
–
they
knew
th e
ropes,
which
we
did n™t
know.
There
were
the
Spanish
–
there
were
Spani s h
internees
fr
om
the
Republicans
who
escape

from
Franco™ s
Spain
when

what
do
you
call
this

barbed

so
that
we
got
somewhat
off
the
floor.
We
cou ld
buy
this
for
a
–
for
a
few
French
fra

And
in
–
by
th e
way,
I

I
forgot
to

that

on

–
our

which
we
were
permitted
to

was
excha nged
against
2,000

And
that
was
the

we

Two

And
that
was,
of

Š
it
was
a
problem;
be cause
if
no

be

fr om
anywhere,
you
coul d

to

with
the

you

in

What
–
aside
from
the
food
that
you

–
wh at

you

That
we
–
we
had
–
we
were
told
to
pack
some
food;
so
we
had
some
cons
–
[NOTE:

Aside
from
the

wh a t

what
else
did
you

We
packed
as

as
we

and
as

as
we

I

I

from

my

I
had
a

which
was

and
this
kept

warm
more

throughout

until
I
got
into

into
Switzerland .

Ho w
long
we re
you
at
Gurs?

I
was
in
Gurs
for
20
month s .
Eventually
I
–
the
Fre nch
are
strange
people
–
eve n tually
to
start
out
with,
the
milit
–
the
paramilitary
G

was
removed;
and
Fren ch
civili an

who
were
just
as
badly
off
as
we
wer e,
replaced
them.
I
manag ed
to
eventually
work
in
–
in
the
office
of
the
block.
I
started
to
play
music.
Since
the
French
are
str a nge
people
and
encouraged
cultural
activities
in
a
concentrati
o
n
cam p,
we
played
cham ber
music.
We
had
a
small
orchestra.
Th ere
were
cab a ret
performers
fr om
Paris
who
gave
performances;
ther e
was
a
whole
cu ltural
life.
There
were
people
who
spoke
who
were
PhD™s;
th ere
were
journalists
who
commen t
–
who
had
commentaries
with
an
illegiti mate

on

than
the

of

in

in
th e

because
I
coul d

at

at

which
I
was
given
because
I
play ed

You

I

Did

Oh
no,
no,
no ,
no;
th e
YMCA
in
France
provided
instruments.
There
were
social
workers
per mitted
in
camp;
and
th us,
the
social
workers
started
to
–
efforts
were
quite
successful
in
removing
you nger
–
the
you nger
generation
fr om
cam p.
Ev entually,
sometime
early
in
™41
already
or
the
middle
of
™41,
the
camp
was
pa
rtially
reduced
in
–
in
pop ulation
by
te ll ing
us
tha t
fa milies
with
children
are
goi ng
to
be

moved
to
a
di fferent
cam p
Š
which
was
Rivesaltes,
w hich
was
–
had
supposedl y
better
barracks.
Otherwise,
th e
regime
–
th e
regime
was
the
same.
But
to
a
lot
of
people
lef t,
bu t
whoever
was
staying,
th e
y o unger
generation
was
–
was
slowly
being
removed.
And
what
is
worth
m entioning,
of
course,
is
tha t
the
Swiss
Red
Cross
was
given
a
barrack
and
a
–
a
–
a
nurse,
Elsbeth
Kasser.
She™s
still
alive
[NO TE:
she

is
quite
famous
Š
started
to
supplement
with
Swiss
food
the
ra tions
which
we
got
and
w hich
really
was
the
mai n
meal
for
many
of
us
under
21.
But
we
had
to
go
to
the
barracks
an
d
ea t
it
there
be cause
she
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
ate
the
food
and
not
tak e
it
to
our
–
110;
56:03
Not
th e
Fr ench
–
No;
no
–
that
we
would
ea t
it.
It
was
me
ant
for
us,
and
tha t
we
wo uldn™t
take
food
with
us
to
give
our
families.
Oh;
OK

It
was
meant
for
the
young
ones.
OK;
I
thought
maybe
they
were
afr aid
of
corru pti on.
They
were
als o
quite
afraid
of
corruption;
they
didn™t
want
this
foo d
to
end
up
in
th
e
–
in
the
black
market.
We
were
give
n
pi
eces
of
chees e;
we
were
gi ven
Farina
to
eat;
we
were
given
Ovaltine.
It
was,
as
far
as
I
am
concern ed,
it
was
my
–
my
main
meal
Š
the
main
meal
of
my
day.

Did
your
mother
get
any
of
thi s
?

No,
they
–
th ey
did n™t
per mit
it.

Were
you
abl e
to
meet
with
he r
at
any
time
and
talk
to
her?

Well,
my
mother
was
Š
w hile
I
was
in
the
office
in
my
block
Š
my
moth er
was
in
th e
office
of
her
block.
And
since
I
eve n
tua
lly
was
able
to
move
very
f r eely
in
–
in
camp,
I
was
able
to
see
my
mother
daily.
I
was
also
able
to
see
my
recently
acquired
girlf r iend
daily.

Aha!
Aha!
You
had
a
girlfriend
–

Yes.

–
at
th e
camp.

And
we
also
went
toget he r
every
day
to
–
to
th
e
Sw
iss
barrack
to
eat
toget her.
You
an d
your
girlfriend.
My
and
my
gi rlfriend;
w hich
later
be came
my
wife.

Yes.
And
–

Ho w
was
your
mother
coping?
My
mother
was
coping
fairly
well
beca u s e
somehow
or
other,
peo ple
in
the
offices
ate
somewhat
better
than
the
rest
of
th e
population .
The
food
cam e
from
–
was
delivere d
firs t
to
the
–
wa s
pick ed
up
first.
And
they
got
somewhat
more
substance
than
th e
rest.
Ri ghtly
or
wrongly,
we
are
not
going
to
argue.
But
it
was
a
fact
th
at
those
wh
o
worked
in
offices
ate
slightly
better.
It
was
still
not
en ough.
The
bread
rations
were
the
same.
Even tuall y ,
my
girlfri e nd
lef t;
but
she
will
tell
he r
own
story.
And
because
of
corruption ,
the
Fren ch
decid
ed
to
close
my
block
and
distri
bute
th e
people.
Sin ce
I
was
a pproached
by
a
Fre nch
inspector
who
was
responsible
for
our
bl ock;
and
prob ably
also
was
responsible
for
closing
our
block
be cause
he
saw
what
was
goi ng
on
by
the
–
with
the
pe ople
who
wer e
running
th e
block,
who
were
res p
onsible
for
the
blo ck;
and
who
were
co rrupt.
I
was
able
to
eventually
be
move d
into
th e
hospital
of
the
cam p,
where
I
was
r unni ng
the
office.
That
was
a
pr ivilege
I
was
given
becaus e
I
had
closed
the
bl ock
I
was
responsible
for;
giving
back
to
the
Fre nch
all
of
th
e
inve
ntory
which
was
there
Š
the
pots
and
pans
which
everybody
had ,
which
were
issued
new
fr om
th e
ne w
block;
etc.,
etc.
So
because
I
did
a
good
job,
e v entually
I
ended
up
in
the
hospital
Š
w hich
was
a
very
favorite
pl ace
because
I
ha d
a
room
which
I
shared
with
one
oth
e
r
man
in
the
hospital.
We
had
heat
every
nigh t
in
our
room;
we
had
beds
Š
we
had
hospi tal
be ds.
I
ha d
hea t
all
day
in
the
office.
So
I
was
somewhat
privileged
for
a
few
month s
until
the
OS E
[NOTE:

took
me
out
of
cam p
Š
in
end
of
June
I
would
say
–
begin ni ng
of
July.
Probably
was
the
end
of
Jun e
of
1942,
and
it
was
fortunate
be cause
whoever
was
in

on
A ugust

would
be

Were
you
abl
e
to
say
goodbye
to
your
mother?
158;
1:00:13
Well,
I
said
g oodbye
to
my
mother
when
I
left
cam p
to
go
to
–
to
this
far m
to
which
I
was
b r ought
by
the
social
worker
of
the
OSE
[? ].
I
wasn™ t
in
this
farm
Š
which
was ,
by
the
way,
run
by
th e
Je wish
Boy
Scout
of
Fran ce
Š
more
th an
about
five
or
six
weeks.
About
six
weeks,
beca use
then
th ere
was
a
raid
planned
on
the
farm
to
arrest
th e
foreign
Jews
which
were
there;
and
w hich
meant
that
eve rybody
had
to
be
dispersed.
The
problem
was
that
this
was
an
Orthodox
farm
.
Th
ere
were
–
the
–
the
director
of
th e
farm
was
a
Alsatian
Orthodox
Jew
who
ran
this
farm
with
the
assistance
of
two
Germa n
rabbis
who
came
from
Gu rs
Š
Orthodo x.
And
when
it
ca me
time
to
disperse
us,
ther e
were
fou
r
people
who
were
not
Orthodox
Š
a
f e llow
who
ca me
with
me
from
Gurs
who
was
somewhat
youn ger
than
I;
and
two
somewhat
older
f ellow s ,
maybe
a
year
or
two
older
than
I
was,
of
Polish
background.
And
we
were
told
we
would
have
to
hel p
ourselves;
there
was
–
they
cou ldn™t
do
anythi
ng
for
us.

What
was
the
na
me
of
thi s
Jewish
Boy
Scout
orga niz ati on ;
a
Fr ench
name?
[NOT E:
unintelligible;
Max
promp ted
by
his

The
farm
–
the
farm
was
in
a
village
cal led
Tal uyers,
which
was
outside
of
Lyon
–
was
very
cl ose
to
Lyon.
And
since
my
wife,
or
my
girlfrien
d
at
the
ti me,
had
permission
to
visit
he r
mother
at
the
begin ning
of
August,
I
saw
her
on
the
way.
She
visited
me
on
the
way
to
ca mp.
She
was
already
in
Le
Chambon,
and
when
she
came
ba ck,
she
told
me
th e
horror
stories
that
the
de
portations
ha
d
started
in
–
in
Gurs;
and
that
she
was
able
to
say
goodbye
to
her
mo ther ;
and
that™s
her
story.
And
we
arranged
at
that
point
tha t
if
I
would
ge t
into
troubl e ,
since
Le
Chambon
wasn™t
far
away,
and
she
felt
very
certain
that
these
pe
ople
would
help
when
I
get
in
troubl e,
I
will
try
to
ma ke
my
way
to
Le
Chambon
Š
to
join
up
with
her.
Little
did
I
know
that
a
few
w eeks
later
I
was
in
Le
Chambon.
And
I
arrived
ther e
after
we
wer e
de nied
help,
when
help
was
neede d
Š
in
the
mid dle
of
the
nig ht.
Where
would
I
know
–
where
would
I
find
my
wife
in
th e
mi ddle
of
the
ni ght?
So
we
ca mped
ne xt
to
a
te nnis

place
in
a
littl e
wood
–
a
tennis
field
in
a
littl e
wood.
And
chan ce
would
have
it
that
in
th e
morning
at
5:30,
a
group
of
young
tee nage
girls
would
walk
by.
And
amongst
the m
was
my
wife,
my
gir lfriend,
who
refused
to
turn
around
when
I
whis tled
after
her
Š
and
had
to
be
physic
ally
turn
ed
around
by
one
of
her
gir lfriends.
[NOTE:
qu estion
direc ted
to
wife.]
Uh
h uh;
‚cause
you
di dn™ t
recognize
him ,
or
you
didn ™t
–
you™re
not
accustomed
to
bei ng
whi s tle d
at?
She
didn™t
wa nt
to
be
whis tled
at,
and
she
di dn™t
real ize
it
was
I.
Aha!
So
when
I
explained
th
e
circ
umstanc
es
why
I
was
her e,
she
took
me
to
Mireill e
Philip
Šwho
was
the
wife
of
what
was
later
to
become
the
fi nance
min ister
of
de
Gaulle
in
his
first
government;
who
was
already
th en
with
de
Gaull e
in
En gland.
And
she
mad e
sure
that
after
one
nig ht
in
the
village,
in
a
villa
with
people
who
were
very
willing
to
gi ve
me
a
room
for
the
nig ht
and
fed
me,
I
was
pla ce d
on
a
far m
about
an
hou r
and
a
half
to
two
hour
away
by
foot
Š
where
I
stayed
about
three
and
a
half
weeks.
And
these
farm
ers
shared
their
food
with
me .
They
put
me
into
th eir
hayloft.
And
after
three
and
a
half
weeks,
I
was
already
certain
that
I
was
forgotte n
be cause
no
–
I
–
I
had
heard
nothi ng
and
seen
nothing;
until
ther e
was
all
of
a
sudden
a
littl
e
message
from
my
wife
who,
in
those
days,
also
was
hiding
on
a
farm
be cause
the
raids
had
–
where
ha d
started
in
Fra nce
to
arrest
Jews.
And
I
got
a
little
note
from
he r
that
she
wa s
well;
she
was
–
she
was
on
a
farm
Š
I
shouldn™t
worry.
Shortly
thereafter,
I
was
picked
up,
broug
h
t
back
to
Le
Chambon
–
where
I
found
my
girlfriend.

217;
1:05:05
You
were
pic k ed
up
by
fri ends?

By
–
by –
by
people
from
–
from
the
vi llage.
Madam e
Philip
made
sure
that
I
was
photograp hed;
I
was
given
false
papers.
And
day s
later,
with
f
a lse
papers
and
three
other
fellows,
we
were
dire cted
to
a
village
one
stop
from
Saint
r
Gervais
in
th e
Fren ch
Alps .
It
went
ther e
by
train.
We
fared
w ell,
nobody
challenged
us ;
nobody
stopped
us.
And
I
was
also
standing
very
often
next
to
a
g endarme,
‚c
au
se
I
–
I
felt
that
was
a
good
way
of
not
getting
che cked
on
papers.
You
don™t
stand
ne xt
to
a
gen dar me
when
you
have
a
bad
consci enc e.
Right.

And
from
this
place
near
Saint
r
Gervais,
we
were
take n
th e
next
morning
on
a
36
or
30,
40
hour
hike
Š
high
into
the
mountains.
Th
e
leader
of
the
four
of
us
was
a
young
10,
11
year
old
boy
who
kn ew
th ese
mountains
by
heart.
He
ha d
along
a
young
Fre nch
pa stor,
a
Protestant
minister
who
was
supposed
to
learn
the
way
to
guide
others.
So
that
–
that
way
we
were
overnight.
We
started
early
in
the
morning;
we
walked
all
day;
we
clim
bed,
we
cli
m bed,
we
cli m bed.
When
ni ghtfall
came,
we
found
a
rock
overhang
un der
which
we
stayed
beca use
it
was
raining
that
ni g ht.
The
ne xt
morning
we
went
on,
still
climbi ng,
unti l
the
boy
stopped
and
told
us
now
we
ha ve
to
go
down,
and
eventually
we™ll
reach
Switzerla
nd.
Which
we
did
,
only
to
be
a rrested
on
about
half
an
hour
after
we
were
walki ng
somewhere
h i gh,
still
hig h,
in
the
mountains
on
a
road
with
tunn el s.
And
th e
–
the
Swiss
pa tr ol
arrested
us,
s t
opped
us,
br
ought
us
to
a
mountain
hu t
which
–
which
had
a
r estoration
service.
There
was
a
restaur a nt
there;
we
could
sleep
there
overnight.
And
we
fo und
that
we
were
mayb e
numb e r
36,
37,
38,
39
of
a
group
of
people
who
all
had
comin g
in
this
regio n
Š
wer
e
found
and
stopped
and
held
by
the
Swiss
authorities.
We
were
given
food,
even
though
S w itzerlan d
ha s
rationing,
without
rationing
stamps,
for
our
money
Š
I
had
a
little
Fre nch
–
Swiss
money
on
me.
And
after
breakfast
th e

next
morni ng
we
wer e
told
by
the
com m anding
officer
of
this
conti ngen t
of
Swis s
soldiers
tha t
now
we
would
be
sent
ba ck
to
Swi t zerland
[NO T E:
in terje ctio n
of
his
wif e:
ﬁto
Franceﬂ]
–
to
France.
We
would
not
–
we
cou ld
not
stay
in
Switzerla nd.
And
on
th e
way
back
to
what
they
calle d
no
man™s
la
nd,
all
of
a
sudden
I
was
picke d
on
by
a
Swiss
sergeant
who
started
to
scream
and
yell
at
me;
and
was
tr ying
to
tell
me
what
I™m
not
suppo sed
to
do.
That
went
on
for
about
15
or
20
minu tes.
Why
he
pi cke d
me
I
still
don™t
know.
I
don™t
even
know
who
th
e
man
is,
but
it
dawned
on
me
when
he
was
finished
s c reaming
and
yelli ng,
telling
me
what
I™m
not
supposed
to
do
Š
that
he
had
given
me
an
exa ct
char t
of
what
I
should
do.
All
I
ha d
to
do
is
ignore
the
ﬁ
no
ﬂ,
ﬁ
don™t
ﬂ,
and
do;
and
then
substi
tu te
ﬁ
do
ﬂ,
and
he
had
given
me
a
–
270;
1:09:09
So,
ignore
all
th e
negatives,
the
ﬁ
not™s
ﬂ
–
Ya,
while
I
ha d
to
fi gure
th at
out
for
my self
of
course
and
without
the
ﬁ
no t™s
ﬂ
he
had
told
me
exa c
tly
what
to
do
to
get
back
in
to
Switzerland .
The
tragedy
was
that
after
the
Swiss
stopped
us,
tol d
us
to
keep
on
going
dow
–
down,
and
left
us,
the
trage dy
was
when
I
stopped,
the
30
or
40
peopl e
who
were
with
me,
nobody
ha d
un derstood
what
was
–
had
transpir
e
d
there.
And
I
finally,
after
an
hour
Š
with
the
exce ption
of
one
man
who
followed
my
rea s oning;
nothi ng
to
lose
bu t
to
gain
Š
th e
other
38
went
back
to
–
to
France,
while
he
and
I
tur ned
around
and
tri ed
our
way
back
into
Switzerl and.
I
had
managed
to
look
at
a
map
the
nigh
t
bef o re,
and
I
kne w
approxima tely
where
I
was.
So
we
started
crossing
a
very
tiny
water,
which
was
ice
water
which
ca me
from
a
glacier
which
went
down
into
France.
We
crossed
this.
With
one
step
we
were
across,
and
I
ha d
–
I
discover
ed
fur ther
up
–
woods
and
what
looked
li ke
a
walk.
So
we
climbed
there,
and
indeed
when
we
came
up
to
the
woods,
we
had
found
a
path.
Which
he
m e nti one d
in
hi s
–
was
he
–
did
–

No,
he
d idn™t
mention
–

He
didn™t
menti
o
n
it?

No,
no.
And
we
followed
that
pa th
and
eventually
we
ended
up
in
a
village
which
was
called
Finha ut
in
Switzerla nd.
We
had
bee n
explai ned
in
France,
in
Ch ambon,
tha t
if
we
need
hel p
we
should
look
first
for
a
French
minister™s.
If
there
are
no
French
pasto
rs,
go
to
th
e
Catholic
Chur
ch
–
Protestant
ministers.
If
we
coul dn™t
find
Protestant
ministers,
go
to
the
Catholic
Chur ch.
T h ough
in
a
villa ge
like
this
in
Swi tze rland,
hig h
up
in
th e
Valai s ,
there
are
no
Protestants;
ther e
are
only
Catholics.
So
I
went
to
the
chur ch ,
and
I
asked
for
Monsieur
le
Curé;
but
u n
fortunately,
the
villa
ge
pri est
wasn™t
th ere
for
the
day.
He
had
gone
dow n
to
–
into
th e
–
to
a
–
to
the
–
to
the
administrativ e
point
of
the
Catholic
Church.
So
we
went
on,
and
it
be came
dark.
We
had
been
on
the
road
all
day,
and
I
de
cide
d
I™m
not
going
to
sleep
another
ni g ht
–
if
I
can
help
it.
So
we
went
past
a
few
houses
Š
small
village
Š
stretched
out
and
high
up
in
th e
mounta ins;
must
–
must
have
be en
over
–
stil l
over
2,000
meters.
And
I
kno cke d
on
the
door
of
a
house
w
hich
I
li
ked.
And
after
some
to
do,
beca use
th e
man
explaine d
to
me
he™s
a
new
–
a
newl y
r
wed;
he
ha s
[?
uni ntel ligible]
–
it™s
his
brother
r
in
r
la w™s
house.
We
were
invited
in;
we
were
given
food;
we
were
given
a
–
a
room;
and
we
were
give n
di
rections
how
to
get
on
into
the
–
down
into
th e
v a lley.

And
we
walked
another
day,
and
by
mi d
r
afternoon
we
were
in
a
village
ne xt
to
Martig ny
where
I
went
to
the
Catholic
pries t
beca use
I
had
no
more
money .
Actually
it
was
around
no on,
and
we
we
r
e
down.
I
went
to
the
C a tholic
Church;
the
priest
gave
us
some
food
to
eat.
He
gave
me
five
francs,
which
permitted
me
to
buy
a
ti cket
to
Lausan ne.
The
fello w
I
was
with
had
enough
money
for
hi m,
Swiss

money
Š
was
older
than
I
was.
And
so
we
ended
up
in
the
sta tion
in
Lausan ne,
and
we
were
about
20
minu tes
in
La usanne
in
the
station,
not
knowing
wha t
to
do.
325;
1:13:14
You
know,
eventually
you
–
you
some ti mes
you
hit
a
snag;
it
was
my
–
my
ball
game.
The
other
guy
just
followed
me;
whatever
I
said,
he
di d.
And
so
it
dawned
on
me
Š
you™re
a
Jew;
let™s
look
for
the
Jewish
congr egation.
I
loo ked
in
the
tel ephone
book,
eventually .
Nobody
had
bothered
us
in
th e
station,
even
though
we
were
–
must
have
been
–
quite
conspicu
ous.
And
th
e n
I
looked
in
the
–
the
telephone
book,
and
there
it
was
Š
Cong
–
Congrega tion
Israeli;
and
it
was
Rue
de
la
Gare,
w hich
is
Railroad
Stre et.
So
it
was
within
two
or
thre e
mi nu te s;
and
we
went
there .
And
the
first
thing
th ese
people
told
us,
‚You™re
no t
going
to
be
returned.
We
have
to
turn
you
over
to
the
Swiss
auth
o
rities,
but
you
will
be
interned;
but
you
won™t
be
returned
to
Fr ance.™
And
that
is
what
hap pen e d.
We
were,
for
about
three
mon ths,
in
two
quaranti ne
ca mps.
And
from
there
we
wer e
tur
ned
over
into
civilian
control.
And
I
was
assigned
to
a
labor
camp
in
Sierre,
which
is
in
the
Fr ench
part
of
Swi tzerland,
in
th e
Rhon e
valley .
I
got
there
on
December
23
to
a
to tall y
empty
camp.
What
it
was
Š
they
had
leave
of
absence
for
the
holidays,
for
Christmas.
And
th e
cam
p
dire
ctor
asked
me
if
I
had
relatives
where
I
coul d
go
–
or
friends
where
I
could
go;
and
I
said,
‚
Yes,
I
have
relatives
abo ut,
ap proxim ately
where
I
came
from.™
So
I
tur ned
around.
He
gave
me
a
ticket;
he
gave
me
a
pass;
and
I
wen
t
to
my
cousin
who
m
I
hadn™t
seen
in
–
I
don™ t
know
how
many
years.
And
I
spent
Christmas
with
my
cousin.
And
so
after
Christmas
I
came
ba ck
to
camp,
and
I
started
life
in
a
Swiss
labor
camp .
We
shoveled
snow
becaus e
it
had
snowed
over
Chris tmas;
and
th
at
wasn™t
for
me.
I
di dn™t
like
that.
So
within
a
week
I
manage d
to
get
into
the
office.
And
I
was
interned
in
S w itzerland,
in
va rious
camps
and
internment
hom es.
What
tha t
meant
–
it
–
what
people
didn™t
–
wha t
peopl e
here
don™t
realize
is
that
in
Switzerland
people
who
ill
egall y
came
to
Switzerla nd
were
interne d.
And
w hile
it
was,
of
cour se,
considera bly
be tter
tha n
what
was
h a ppenin g
to
us
in
Fran ce,
we
wer e
interned.
The
Swiss
were
no t
ni ce
about
it;
we
were
ha rassed.
Every
so
often
we
were
asked
when
are
we
going
to
leave.
And
they
knew
–
the
Swiss
knew
pe rfectly
well
we
couldn™t
leav
e.
There
was
nowhere
to
go
during
the
war.
So
I
was
in
Swi tzerlan d,
in
various
offices
of
camps
and
homes,
for
five
and
a
half
years
until
we
were
able
to
emigrate .
I
married
my
wif e
in
Switzerla n
d
and
in
–
she
was
able
to
join
me
in
voluntary
internment.
Our
dau ghter
was
bo rn
while
we
were
interne d.
And
eve ntually,
in
Marc h
of
1948,
we
were
able
to
come
to
the
Unit ed
States .
As
you
went
across
Franc e
towards
Switzerland,
did
you
know
whe the r
your
father
was
still
in
France?

Yes.
I
kne w
my
father
was
in
Ni
ce.
I
corresponded
with
hi
m
until
hi s
deportation .
I
corresponded
with
my
mother
until
she
was
depo rted.
Sh e
knew
–
my
–
my
mother
knew
when
she
was
de ported
that
I
was
safe.

She
knew
you
were
saf e.
And
my
father
knew
tha
t
we
were
eng
a ged.
In
fa ct,
in
one
of
his
last
letters
he
wrote
us
if
we
should
get
married
Š
so
that
my
wife
would
not
get
into
ill
repute .
[NOT E:
Wif e
gives
a
little
l a ugh.]
Now
wh at
was
your
father
doing
from
wha t
you
could
tell
from
his
letters?

He
was
–
he
was
trying
to
exist
from
da y
to
day.
Ho w
was
he
–
how
was
he
managi ng?
391;
1:17:41
He
wasn™t
–
because
he
managed
–
my
father
ma naged
–.
What
I
negle cted
to
say
before ,
was
that
on
Sep tembe r
1,
1939
my
grandmother ,
who
was
a
French
ci tize n,
had
to
leave
Germany
overnight
because
of
th
e
war.
I
–
we
were
able
to
get
–
to
rent
a
cab
–
I
got
special
–
I
was
able
to
get
a
special
allocation
of
gasoline,
because
gasoline
was
all
of
a
s udden
rationed,
of
course,
in
Ger many.
She
was
able
to
go
to
the
French
r
Swiss
border
in
Lörrach
by
cab.
She
wanted
to
join
he r
sister
in
Swi tzerland .
However,
she
was
not
per mitted
to
enter
Switzerland
be cause
th e
Swiss
overn ight
had
issued
a
visa
requirem ent,
and
she
had
no
visa.
So
she
was
able
to
get
into
Alsace.
She
was
in
a
old
age
ho
me.
She
was
taken
into
an
old
age
home
in
Nan cy.
Eventually ,
when
Ger m any
overran
France,
she
m a naged
to
go
to
Bordeaux.
She
was
in
an
old
age
f a cility
in
Bordeaux.
While
she
was
in
this
facility
in
Bordeaux,
she
manag ed
to
ge t
a
permission
to
cr oss
over
to
th
e
non
–
Bordeaux
was
occupied
by
Ger mans.
And
she
man a ged
to
ge t
travel
permi ts.
She
came
from
Bordeaux
to
Gurs,
and
she
visited
with
my
mother
and
me
for
one
w eek
Š
meani ng,
she
was
in
a
village
outside
of
the
camp.
Walked
every
day
in
the
broiling
summer
heat
of
–
was
it
Augus

–
I
believe
–

[NOTE:
dis cussion
with
wif e
whether
it
was
1 940
or
1941],
™41.
Do
I
have
tha t
right?
–
then
it
was
in
July
or
Augus t.
She
walked
every
day
from
the
village
to
th e
cam
p
en
trance,
and
my
mother
and
I
would
have
permission
to
talk
to
her
fo r
a
whole
week.
Even tuall y
my
grandm other
moved
from
–
managed
to
get
from
Bordeaux
to
Ni ce.
And
since
my
father
was
in
Nice,
and
my
grand mothe r
was
in
Nice,
they
set
up
a
househ old.
My
gran dmother
die
d
in
–
I
ca n
tell
you
exa ctly
–
on
–
on
the
20
th
of
June
1943;
di ed
of
na tural
causes
after
an
operation
at
th e
age
of
73.
And
my
father,
I
would
assume,
said
while
she
was
th ere
she
had
means.
She
got
–
got
also
from
–
some
mon ey
from
the
French
governmen t
as
a
French
ci tizen
Š
an
old
age
pensio n
or
whatever.
So
my
father
somehow
managed
to
survive.
He
was
aware
that
we
–
that
–
444;
1:21:04
Was
this
Grandmothe
r
–
Liebm
an n?

[Interview er,
Max,
and
Ma x™s
wife
are
talking
over
each
other.]
No,
no.
This
was
Grandm other
Levi.
Grandmoth er
Li ebmann
die d
when
I
was
a
six
or
seven
year
old
boy.

OK,
OK.

My
father
–
I
was
in
correspondence
with
my
father
un
til
he
was
depo rted.
He
was
aware
th at
th ere
was
a
girl.
He
corresponded
with
this
gir l,
and
he
suggested
very
str o ngly
we
get
married
as
soon
as
possible.
And
this
was
–
I
mean
we
kn
ew
that
he
wa
s
in
a
very
dif f icult
cir cu mstances.
And
we
had
hoped
he
wo uld
survive
since
he
had
m a naged
so
far .
But
it
was
an
accide nt
th at
he
ran
into
a
–
a
German
patr ol
when
they
were
arresting
peopl e
in
a
house
where
he
was
visiting.
So
they
to ok
him
along;
he
wasn™t
on
the
list.
So
he
wa
s
arr
este d
by
the
–
the
SS.

By
the
SS
or
the
Gestapo ;
and
he
was
depo rted
in
–
I
thi nk
it
was
November
of
1944.
One
of
the
last
–

Ya.
We
got
married
in
April
of
1945
after
we
bo th
ma naged
to
ge t
birth
cer tifica tes
from
Ger many.
That
also
was
a
whole
story
beca use
while
my
wife
had
relatives
in
Switzerlan
d
from
whom
she
walked
away
becaus
e
th ey
ma de
her
life
so
mi serable,
they
were
not
aware
tha t
we
re ally
wanted
to
get
married
right
away.
And
after
we
finally
had
our
birth
certifi cates,
since
my
wife
was
being
tre a ted
by
the
Swiss
under
Ger man
la w,
and
she
was
not
yet
21,
she
neede d
a
parent
–
a
parental
permission
to
get
married.
So
the
Swiss
appointed
a
guardian,
a
le
gal
guardian,
who
gave
permission.

Someone
wh o
you
bar ely
knew.
Didn™t
know
at
all
Š
he
was
a
–
a
young
struggling
lawyer.
[N OTE:
wife
i nterje c ts
something
unintelligib
le.]
He
had
a
la
w
office,
but
he
was
a
young
–
fairly
yo ung
man
the n.
And
I
want
you
to
know
that
in
–
in
the
80™s
he
still
was
in
the
same
pla ce,
in
th e
same
law
office.
And
we
visited
hi m.
Same
furni ture.

Same
fur niture;
he
made
us
stay
Š
he
remembered
us.
So
after
we
married,
my
wife
was
–
got
permission
–
I
got
–
was
abl
e
to
get
permission
for
her
to
join
me.
We
had
to
pay
first
–
she
was
not
permitted;
she
first
was
–
joined
–
joined
me .
Then
the
–
the
order
cam e
dow
n
Š
she
has
to
have
a
room
in
–
in
where
I
was
interned.
She
couldn™t
live
in
th e
ho me;
eventually
we
were
able
to
get
this
rescinde d.
Sh e
also
had
to
eat
out.
Eventually
this
wa s
rescinde d,
but
we
had
to
pay
for
her.
So
throughout
while
I
was
interned,
I
had
to
pay
for
my
wife
at
–
at
the
same
rate
as
the
Swiss
personnel
had
to
pay
fo r
room
and
board.

1:24:30
So
eventually
we
wer e
able
to
emigrate
–
in
Marc h
of
–
end
of
Fe bruary
of
194 8.
We
left
Sw
itzerlan d,
and
we
arrived
in
th
e
Unit e d
Sta tes
in
March
of
1948.

You
bec ame
New
Yorkers.
[Interje ction
by
his
wif e:
ﬁand

wha t
you
forgotﬂ]
What?
Oh
ya,
of
course
Š
in
–
on
Marc h
4,
1946
a
d a ughter
was
born
in
–
in
S w itzerlan d,
in
Vevey.

The
first
of
–

The
first
and
only.

First
and
l
a
st.
Ya.
The
first
and
last
simply
beca use
after
we
came
he re,
we
first
had
to
start
try ing
to
make
a
living.
And
within
two
years
after
we
came
he re,
we
both
were
sick
with
TB,
and
firs t
had
to
go
to
a
sanatorium
for
18
months
for
myself;
an
d
I
think
tw
o
years
for
my
wife.
While
my
dau ghter
had
to
be
take
–
put
into
a
foster
ho me;
and
after
this,
we
had
to
start
all
over
again
to
build
a
fa mily
and
a
life .
So
really
our
American
life
started
in
ea rnest
after
I
came
out
of
the
sanatorium
.
I
went
to
s c hool;
I
was
able
finally
to
learn
a
profession;
I
learned
accounting.
I
went
to
a
–
a
private
business
school
where
Š
in
eight
months,
nine
months
Š
I
was
able
to
do
four
years
of
colle ge
–
accoun ti
ng
–
college

accoun ting,
which
gave
me
enough
of
making
a
living.
And
from
then
on,
you
know,
we
–
we
lived
a
American
life .
Happily
ever
afte r.
