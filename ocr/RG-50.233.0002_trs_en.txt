Interview with Inge Auerbacher 
 

April 11, 1992 

 

Jama ica, New York 

 

 

Q: So, we™ll just begin with your name .      

 

A: Okay.  My name  is Inge Auerbacher.  
I was born in a little village in Southern 
Germany ca lled Kippenheim   It™s a little
 town at that time about 2,000 people, 
very close to the borders 
of France and Switzerland and we had about 60 Jewish 
fa milies living there.  We  were all quite 
Orthodox in a modern way.  We  went to 
the Synagogue on Friday nights and Sabba
th, and we were really a very nice 
community.  Most of the Jewish people ha
d little stores ther
e or were cattle 
dealers and that is a profession that a gr
eat ma ny Jews in Southern Germany were 
involved in.  In fact, my grandparents, th
e grandfathers actually on both sides, my 
mother™s side, my mother™s father and mo
ther.  On that side, my grandfather was 
cattle dealer there and my 
grandfather from my father
™s side wa s also a cattle 
dealer and skin and hide business.  I di
d not know my grandparents on my father™s 
side; his parents, they had died before 
my parents got married and my father was 
one out of six children; my mother 
one out of two.  And I did know my 

grandparents from my mother™s side with
 whom I had a very 
close relationship.  
They live about four or five hours away in an even smaller village than the one I 

was born in.  That village was called Je
benhausen, when mi ne was Kippenheim.  
In fact, my grandmother™s, the village 
where my grandparents lived had famous 
person roots there too, by the name  of Albe
rt Einstein.  Albert Einstein had spent 
quite a fe w su mmers in that little villag e, I believe his grandmother or aunt and 

uncle, some body in that fa mily had a little ba
kery there, and he visited quite often.  
I don™t recall ever seeing him there.  Of course he was quite grown at that time 

already and some how it was not even known 
that he was such a fa mous ma n.  I 
mean he wa s a little boy at that time
 and nobody ever spoke about that again.  I 
only found out about this much later.  I di
d not play with any non-Jewish children 
in my village.  I mainly spent my time with Jewish children and anyway I only 

spent about four or five years in my v
illage.  It was, we had a good relationship 
with the people in, the Christian people
 in Kippenheim, but we lived separate 
lives and a good co-existence.  But there 
was always some  undercurrents of anti-

Se mitism.  That™s what my parents told me  too.  We had a very large house, about 

17 rooms.  We had servants.  Some  of, 
I don™t reme mber that 
much of my  little 
village, just  mainly some things abou
t going to the Temple, the holidays; I was 

the last Jewish child born in that  little village and one of the ma in events that I 

will never forget is Kristallnacht.  Ac
tually I don™t reme mber Nove mber 9.  
Nothing mu ch happened really on that 
day.  I reme mber November 10 and our 
Synagogue was demolished.  It was not 
set aflame  because the neighboring 

houses, there were a lot of 
Christian neighboring houses a
nd they were afraid that 
they would burn too.  But it was complete
ly ransacked.  My mother saw how the 

 
 
2
Ten Comma ndments were thrown from the top, they were set on top of the 
building and how they were thrown 
down.  I reme mber the day of the 10
th
.  My 
grandparents had come  to visit us and my
 grandfather got up early in the morning 
to go to Temple to mor ning services; he 
was a very Orthodox ma n.  My father and 
my, we actually still in bed and the bell ra
ng and the police came  in and they said 
that all Jewish me n are now under arre
st and that my father should dress 
imme diately and report to City Hall.  Then
 I remember when my father left, our 
house was stone.  All the windows were broken in the entire house and my mother 

and I and my grandmother had to find shelter in a nearby shed.  We  had like a 

courtyard and there was like a little ar
ea in the cour tyard that was used as a 
storage area and we hid in there. 
 

Q: Who were throwing the stone? 

 

A: Some of, some boys.  Who, I mean I real
ly didn™t even see 
them. We just heard 
the noise, you know, when the, in fact 
when the stone were being thrown I 
reme mber we were standing, I believe it was the living room, and they were 

looking at the chandelier in
 our living room and they
 said, oh look at this! The 
chandelier is still st anding, it™s still ha
nging and they threw a big brick inside the 
house and it nearly hit me  and my mother
 just pulled me  away. That™s when we 
went for the neighboring shed and the servan
t girl was with us 
at that time , but 
she was afraid and she ran away.  Then 
they were knocking at the door, there was 
a big, we had this courtyard and a big 
door in front of it and we heard them 
knocking and rattling the doors and but luck
ily they did not come  in.  The boys, 
we were told later, some of them were some  young boys from neighboring towns 

and perhaps some from the town.  I did not
 see them do this.  
But as I said, my 
mother looked through the broken window and she saw how the Ten 

Commandments were thrown down.  And he
re in the shed we stayed for ma ny, 
many hours until it was quiet.  In the mean
time, all the men who had reported to 
the City Hall and the ones who were in
 the Synagogue were arrested.  So my 
grandfather never came home that day.  
They took all these men to Dachau, the 
first concentration camp in Germany.  
Then we went to a neighboring house, a 
Jewish house, where also all of the window
s were broken and to find some  shelter 
and we came.  I think we stayed, my moth
ers that.  I do not reme mber it that we 
stayed overnight with friends.  And then 
we went back to the house and of course 
everythi ng was filled up with broken gla
ss, the whole house and the windows had 
to be boarded up because it was winter of course and it was quite cold already.  

Nove mber is already cold in Germany.  
And my father had been a disabled war 
veteran of World Wa r I.  He was wounde
d on his right shoulder quite badly and 

he could not raise his right arm and he 
was quite a good patriot, I me an he loved 
Germany, so my grandfather he said he 
was born in this country, he would never 
leave it.  He loved his litt
le village of Jebenhausen and he was very happy there.  
And my father always said why should we
 leave here?   I me a n I fought for this 
country; I was wounded for this country; I m
ean nothing is going to happen to us.  
We were very good citizens like, I mean Am
ericans here, if you are, if you were 
born in this country or even if you become
 a citizen, you pledge allegiance to that 

 
 
3
country and we pledged our allegiance to
 Germany.  We  had hundreds of years, 
my fa mily had lived in Germany.  I fact
, one of Germany™s most fa mous poets 
and writers was Berthal Auerbach, who ma de
 the Black Forest famous.  He name  
was Moses Baruch Auerbacher.  He 
live about a hundred years ago and he 
become  wor l d famous.  His books were published in ma ny languages including 
English.  He wrote a lot about the Black Fo
rest.  Well, after a few weeks that my 
grandfather and my father were in D
achau, they came back.  My mother had 
bought a bogus ticket to Trinidad, and she we
nt to some  SS headquarters.  I don™t 
reme mber exactly the neighboring town, a
nd she begged for his release and that 

she had tickets for us to leave and she di
d get my father out at that time and soon 
afterwards my grandfather came out too and 
then we heard of all of the terrible 
things that happened to them in Dachau a
nd one of them my father related that he 
had to–they had to stand for hours on end in
 the courtyard in the exercise area in 
Dachau with their striped unifo
rms.  Of course all of th
eir clot hes were take away 
and in fact to transgre
ss a little bit my–and one of
 the SS people–police people 
from the village in Kippenheim ca me to
 my mother™s–our house and he brought 
a basketful of ties and belts and he said 
oh, here are the remnants of your me n, so 
my mother thought for sure everybody had b
een killed by now.  I mean these are 
the clothes, the ties, the belts and I believe
 some  s hirts and things and, but anyway 
when they were there of c
ourse they had to give up a
ll their clothing and wore the 
striped uniform.  And they had to stand 
at attention for 10-12 hours at a time  and 
if some body tried to blow their nose–it was quite cold in–I mean the suits were 

a flimsy kind of pajama type
 of suits, they were hosed
 down with cold, ice cold 
water and this happened one to my fa ther
.  Now my grandfather had a very bad 
heart condition and of course this ma de it 
even worse.  He was not an old ma n, he 
was in his early sixties at that time a
nd when he came out of the camp he died 
very soon afterwards of–actually it was a comb ination of a broken heart 

physically and me ntally.  He was just so 
disappointed in the country that he loved 
and that this could happen to him and 
he saw the writing on the wall, but he 
would never leave it.  He said I was born here, and I will di e here no matter what 

happens.  
 

Q: Do you remember what your father looked 
like when he came  back from Dachau?   
Do you remember anything 
particular about that? 
 

A: I reme mber just one thing.  It was qu
ite kind of cold in the house and I don™t 
know, I think we had enough coal or some thing to heat one or two rooms and I 

reme mber, I was a tiny little girl at that
 time , I wa s not even four years old, I 
reme mber sitting on my potty, I remember that I my prayer book in my hand, I™m 

praying for my daddy to come  home  again.  I 
could not read or wr
ite at that time .  
I reme mber when he came , he threw a st
one at the boarded up window.  He didn™t 
ring the bell and he came.  I don™t reme mber
 what he looked like, no I did not, but 
I know my parents talked in hushed voices
, I mean that I should not hear what 
happened and he told my mother, now it™s 
reallytime.  We mu
st leave Germany.  
There is no way that we can stay he re. 
 And my mother star
ted to write so me 
letters to relatives in America.  Th
ere were a few who had done quite well, 

 
 
4
especially an uncle of his who became quite
 well-to-do in America, and the letter, 
the answer we received from the family
 was well, we have a bad recession and 
depression here and you would only add to
 the number of people unemployed and 
you better stay where you are, 
and that was the answer.  
And we just could not get 
the affidavits, the papers to come  here because my father needed to have a higher 
affidavit.  He had to have  a sponsor 
who was willing to ha ve enough money that 
in case he could not work, there would be
 no welfare for us; we had to have our 
own money and my father needed more b
ecause he was a disabled war veteran so 
they figured that he ma y not get a job he
re and we would become  a burden to the 
country.  So that ma de it even harder.  A
nd in the meanti me some of my re latives, 
my father™s sisters, two of them, had go
tten papers to go to Br azil and they did 
leave.  They ma naged to get out and a 
brother of my mother, her only brother, 
received papers from an uncle of my aunt
s to come to America, so they ma naged 
to get here.  And my unc le fought in th
e American Ar my in World Wa r II while 
he was here.  We  did not get out.  So 
after 1938, after Kristallnacht, the night of 
broken glass, after that program we decide
d we have to find some  way to get out.  
so we sold the house at a very cheap pri
ce and moved in with my grandparents.  
And then my grandfather died.  
And it was around–that was in 1939.  I 
reme mber the best time for me of my  
childhood was in this little village of 

Jebenhausen where we had moved in w
ith my grandparents and I had many 
Christian friends, and my grandparents were 
the last Jewish family living in this 
tiny little village where more Jews had 
lived before.  They had moved a way and 
become  big industrialists in 
the neighboring town of Girpingen.  I had a very nice 
time with Christian children and I 
reme mber ma ny times I would be the 
cheerleader walking up and down the hill si
nging the songs of the day which were 
Nazi songs and I would be the one who w
ould be the cheerleader leading them on.  
I did know what the real meaning behind 
these songs were, but I was so caught up 
with the charisma  and the chemistry of 
this day, of this treme ndous upheaval and 
I didn™t know that these people, one of thei
r primary ideas was to hate the Jews!  

We must get rid of the Jews!  The children
 there did not ma ke me  feel bad.  They 
did not call me  any bad name s and they were really my friends and some  of them 

are still my friends today. 
 

Q: Did you know that you were a Jew?  

 

A: I knew that I was Jew, yes.  But it–so me
how it did not occur to me  to think that I 
was really any different.  I mean nobody 
talked to me  from t hese children you 
know, why do you do this and that.  I knew th
at they celebrated Christma s and in 
fact I was a little envious of them bec a us
e it was a very beautiful holiday.  Always 
they received ma ny toys and the Christma
s tree and so ma ny of those decorations 
and all and we didn™t have th
at and that was kind of 
an enviable time  for me  
because everybody was celebrating and of cour
se my grandparents tried very hard 
to ma ke me  feel good about Hanukkah and so
rt of to ma ke me  feel proud that I 
was a Jew.  I was brought up in a very
 good Jewish home; an observant Jewish 
home  in a modern kind of way.  I me an 
during Sabbath, it was really Sabbath.  
We did not do any work, we were not al
lowed to write or do any ma nual labor, 

 
 
5
etc.  It was–all of the things of the 
Sabbath, I mean the way we celebrated was 
the regular observant way.  There was no Synagogue in Jebenhausen, so we 
walked to the neighboring town of Gi rpi
ngen to go to a pray
er service and we 
were not allowed to take the bus.  So we
 walked the three kilome ters back and 
forth through the woods–there was a ro
ad through the woods, and the Synagogue 
in Girpingen in the neighboring town, ha
d been completely burnt to the ground.  
So there was like an apartment in converted in
to a prayer area.  In
 fact at that time  
they didn™t have a rabbi a
ny more and my father ma de the service.  He was very 
good in Hebrew and he led the service for 
the people.  In 1940 I began my school 
career.  And Jewish children were not allo
wed to go to the school in their town.  
There was one school for the State of Wuertte
mb urg.  That was in Stuttgart.  So I 
had to travel, in fact I had to
 get travel permission papers 
to take the trai n.  First I 
had to walk the three kilometers to the 
train station and then
 take the train to 
Stuttgart, which was another hour, and then
 walk by myself to the school.  In the 
beginning, my father took me  with a bicycl
e and he took me to the train station 
and then he had–and then the law came out 
that all Jewish people had to do some  
work–kind of a slave labor and my mother
 had to sew in a corset factory, a 
wome n™s undergarme nt factory and my fa
ther became the cutter.  Although he 
never did this kind of work before, he had 
at that time, I mean before all of this 
happened, he had his own textile busine
ss selling dry goods.  Mainly wholesale 
and retail to different hotels 
and also private people.  He
 sold different things.  
Linen and dry goods.  And after they had to 
do this slave labor, I 
had to travel all 
by myself to the school and it became  quite 
di ffi cult when we had to start to wear 
the star, the yellow star and 
that became  a huge problem.  And my father said to 
me–in fact the star–I was such
 a little girl still.  I wa
s six years old and from the 
age of six in Germany all the people had 
to wear the yellow 
star with the word 
Jew on it.  My star covered mo
st of my left side, I mean I was still a little girl and 
he said when you sit down on the train, si
t in such a way that you can normally 
cover up the star.  In other words, like be
nt over on your left si
de.  It had to be 
worn on the left side over my breast, you 
know on the left side.  And so I did this 

and I was always nervous because there 
were these rowdy school children who 

would go from one town to the next by tr
ain and they would be very fresh and 
they would stare and people always trie
d to have conversation with me  in the 
train.  Why are you going all alone to–tra
veling by yourself and by the age if six 

to go all by yourself to a school so fa
r away.  I mean why don™t you go in your 

own town?   And it was very hard to answ
er them.  They made  me very nervous 
and scared.  I reme mber in the morning 
when I took the train there was always a 
very mean policeman who would be some ti me
s at the station and that really gave 
me  a scare in the morning.  I had to get up very, very early in the morning to 

ma ke the train and I remember once a 
woma n, a Christian woma n, she realized 
that I was Jewish.  She left–when she left
, she left a bag of rolls in a paper bag 
right next to my seat.  She didn™t say a wo
rd, but she left that for me .  And to me  
she–I mean she was resisting what wa s going on but in a silent way, but 

nevertheless she had the heart 
to think of that Jewish 
child who mi ght wanted to 
eat those rolls; she wanted to do some  
kindness to that Jewish child, but very 
afraid to talk to me, but she realized she 
was Jewish.  I reme mber also at that time  

 
 
6
I had to take the train–th
e car I think it was third cl
ass.  In Germany you had 
second and first class trains.  I reme mb
er a group of prisoners–they ma y have 
been Russian prisoners or Polish, I don™t reme
mber.  But they were also herded to 
some where and how they would sit in 
the compartment and sharing a cup of 
some thing or other, some food, they shared
 one cup will contain a drinking out of 
it all at  the same time, going fr om one to the ot her and they were with a 
watchman.  That was in the same  compartment.  It kind of struck some thing in 

me.  I mean I had never–I had come from
 a very, very tiny town and I had never 
been really anywhere, not ma ny miles away
 from my home, a nd seeing things like 
that, it just made me ext r emely nervous a
nd afraid that people were mi streated so 

badly you know, that people could do this
 to other people and these were not 
Jewish people.  In 1941 the transports to
 the so-called East began.   And my 
school was almost, I mean all of the child
ren of the school, almost all of them, 
were in those first few transports.  My
 grandmother and also my parents and 
myself, we received our papers for trans
port to a place called 
Riga, Latvia.  Of 
course, really did not know where thes
e transports were 
going.  We  found out 
later.  And my father did not trust this whole thing and he said you know, I will 

try to see if we can get out of the trans
ports.  So he wrote 
a letter–he made my 
mother actually write a letter to the Nazi 
headquarters in St uttgart to the Gestapo 
headquarters.  And he had a picture take
n, I reme mber that very well, of his 
wounds, and some how the letter worked.  We
 got out of this transport.  And I 
reme mber going with my father because 
I had travel papers and he also had 

because he was supposed to accompany me  in the beginning of going to school; 

he had the papers to go–the permission to go fr om one town to another.  It was 

not permitted anymore to travel by train, bus
 or  anything without papers.  It was 

very hard to get the papers.  And I only
 had them because I had to go to school.  
And I reme mber going with him to the Ge
stapo headquarters for my grandmother 
and they wouldn™t even see us.  Not at 
all.  We  c ould not 
get her out of the 
transpor t and she was sent in the –it was about December–on one of the first 

transpor ts to what was called the East .  A
nd of course those people, almos t  all of 
them from that transport were shot in th
e forest near Riga, th
e ghetto there.  And 
most of the people from my school also were
 in that transport.  As far as I know, I 
am the only child who survived from th
e State of Wuerttemberg in Southern 
Germany.  Now we had to leave– 
 

Q: Can I ask just one question?   Your father was able to write this letter; he had a 
picture of his wounds– 
 

A: We still have this letter by the way.  We have the letter of request to be out of this 
transpor t and somehow they let us go 
because of my father™s disability. 
 

Q: But not your grandmother. 

 

A: Notmygrandmother. 

 

Q: You then made the trip 
to try to convince them to– 

 
 
7
 
A: Yes.  We  we nt to the Gestapo headquar
ters in St uttgart, but we were not even 
allowed to see anybody at all.  We  were 
forced out of my grandmother™s house.  
The house was confiscated, and we were to
ld that you had to move into Jewish 
houses into Jewish houses in the nei
ghborhood town of Girpingen, which was a 
bigger town and there we were in a Je
wish house, owned by Jewish people, and 
had a small apartment there.  And we 
stayed there until the August of 1942, when 
again we received the orders for tr
ansport and then we were sent to 
Theresienstadt.  Now my  whole school 
career was about six months.  I never 
finished my first grade because the school was closed in Stut tgart when all the 

children were taken away anyway and 
the teachers were take n away, it was 
closed.  And then we were sent to Theres
ienstadt (Terezin) in Czechoslovakia.  I 
reme mber how such a transport went.  The police came to our–actually the 

transport papers had an order of ma ybe si
x pages with all the things we could and 
should not take.  And the statement said we
 should not take any sharp utensils.  
They did not want us probably to kill our
selves, I mean they were going to do the 
job themselves.  Good shoes, some  provisi
ons for a journey of two or three days 
and even we took along I think a sewing mach
ine and all different kinds of things 
and I ma de sure that I took along my  doll™
s clothing.  That was packed away.  My 
doll was the most important thing to me. 
 

Q: What was the name  of your doll? 

 

A: My doll™s name  is Marlene .  She was name d afte r Marlene Di etrich, whom I 
idolized.  I loved movie st
ars and so did my mother 
and she showed me once an 
album with a picture of her in it and th
at–I said that™s going to be my doll™s 
name .  She was given to me  on my s ec
ond birthday from my grandmother and I 
still have her today and I donated this
 doll to the Holocaust museum in 
Washington recently, with great trepidati
on, because I really 
dragged her through 
everything.  Now the transport notice said a
ll of these things we could take along.  
We had to assemble in a school gymnasium in Girpingen, the people who were in 
the transport, and ma inly the people who we
re in my transport were disabled war 
veterans and old people.  And we we re
 searched in the gymna sium.  And I  
reme mber I had my doll in my ar m.  I 
would not relinquish he
r at all.  And I 
reme mber one of the people, the SS peopl
e who searched us, took a look at my 
doll and lifted her head.  
She was like–her head had 
been once broken and they 
put a new head on and therefore she was 
put together with rubber bands and you 
could lift the head up.  So he looked in
side her hollow body.  It was a celluloid 
doll.  That™s the kind of dolls you had at t
hose times and he saw that I didn™t have 
any–I wasn™t hiding anything 
inside so I ma de a really big noise there and I 
wasn™t going to give my doll up.  And I 
was the youngest child 
in this transport 
and then he let me  have my doll.  Then
 he saw a wooden pin pinned to me .  And 
he tore that fr om me  and he said in Ge rman [ﬁdu brochest net fur du ingegeﬂ] in 

real [swabian] dial
ect.  In other words, you don™t 
need this where you are going.  
So he tore it from me.  That was the la
st childish thing I had besides my doll. 
 

 
 
8
Q: What was the pin? 
 

A: It was a little Dutch Boy pin.  A wooden 
pin that my mother had given me .  And I 
reme mber my mother said we have to tw
o or three different layers of clothing 
although it was summer.  Because you neve
r know what™s going to happen.  So 
she put on me  a few dresses and forth.  It
 was really hot.  But you know you have 
to have some  more clothing on you b
ecause you never knew what was going to 
happen.  At least you would have that. 
 

Q: Did you dress your doll in more than layer? 

 

A: That I don™t reme mber.  I don™t rememb
er. But later on, incidentally, when the 
transpor t left , which I will talk about later fr om Terezi n, my doll was sewn a 

ruksack, a duffel back which she wore and 
stuffed it with her clothing to prepare 
her for transport.  Unfortunately that
 was lost.  And from there we were 

transpor ted to the gathering place in Stu
ttgart, to a place calle
d Kiletzburg, where 
the people from the other towns were assembled.  Everybody from Stuttgart from 

the Wuertemberg always, the transport left from one area that was called 
Kiletzburg, it was two large halls which we
re used at one time for flower shows 
and here we were about 1,200 people a
pproxima tely, all assembled. And we 
stayed there a few days.  There were not 
beds; they had some  folding chairs and 
we were just lying on the floor and people 
were ma king a lot of noise at night.  In 
fact, there is a movie out of one of the 
transpor ts still available today, actual 
footage out of Kiletzburg.  And I was 
the youngest of those approxima tely 1,200 
people of the whole transport.  There we
re ma inly old people, as I said some  
disabled war veterans and veterans w
ho were awarded the Iron Cross that my 
father had also.  He was awarded the Iron 
Cross.  And from he re we were shipped 
out by train, it was actually 
a regular train, it was not a 
freight train to Terezin.  
We were sealed off, I mean there were
 guards guarding every door and we were 
very, very crowded.  The trip took about 
a day and a half; some thing like that.  
And I reme mber one thing, whenever I got nervous as a child I would get sick to 

my stomach.  And I reme mber I was throwing up in the train and there was no 

water and it was really a terrible thing.  Very crowded. 
 

Q: You were in a seat or were you standing? 

 

A: We were in a seat, but very crowded.  
We  arrived in a place Boschewitz.  At that 
time there were no trains; the tracks di
d not go inside the camp.  And the doors 
opened and–but one thing I reme mber comi ng into this Czech countryside.  I 

saw all these signs, I mean the windows were opened.  I mean you could see 

through the window, let™s put it this way. 
 All these strange 
looking letters, the 
countryside became so strange and it was 
a different language and I could barely 

read German, I had only six months of schooling and it was such a nightma re kind 

of thing. I™m going into a fairyland.  I mean
 all different languages and a different 
way of writing; it was no longer German. 
 And the names of 
the towns that we 
were approaching.   Anyway we arrived in
 Bauschewitz and we were told to get 

 
 
9
out of the car–out of the train–the SS wa
s screaming ‚drop everythingﬂ.  So we 
had to drop everything.  And 
at that time  already, wh
atever we  brought along had 
been confiscated.  I mean we never–none 
of these things ever arrived in the 
camp except my father had invented 
a little pushcart and one day he saw 
some body pushing this little pushcart thr
ough the camp and my father said tht™s 
mi ne, and some how he got this little th
ing back.  It was like four wheels and you 
could collapse it.  Anyhow 
my father got it back later.  Many time s people would 
see clothes on some  other people wearing 
it.  We  were allowed to wear our own 
clothes.  Anyway, we arrived in Baus
chewitz and we had to ma rch for about 
maybe two miles or something in the camp. 
 
Q: Is this during the day? 

 

A: It was during the day.  I reme mber that
 my parents put me in the mi ddle; they 
were on either side of me.  I had my doll in
 my arms; that™s all that was left  and a 
bedroll something.  They let us keep the blankets or some thing that we had rolled 

up.  That, they let us keep. And our tin c
ups and some  containe
rs that we were 
told to buy ahead of time .  So like the Ar my, Ar my dishes, we had some  of that.  

And I reme mber the SS was standing there 
and screaming at us to ma rch and they 
had whips in their hands and I reme mber 
how people were beaten and they were 
already–they couldn™t ma rch.  Some of them
 were very old people.  They fell to 
the ground and we never saw them a gain.  I don™t know what happened to them.  

We all ma rched to an underground area wh
ere we  were searched again.  And my 
mother had taken along a thermos bottle and she put it outside one of the doors 

and said when we come  back there I™m goi
ng to get it.  Of course we never got 
back there.  We were sent to some  unde
rground cell.  Terezin was an old fortress 
town surrounded by huge red walls and underground cells and so forth.  Big 

barracks, brick barracks and houses, actua
l houses because it became, it was an 
army garrison and people actually had lived 
there.  Civilians had lived there too 
and they were thrown out before we cam
e.  I me a n those houses, the old houses 
were completely empty.  There was room
 actually for about 6,000 civilians and at 
any one time 60,000 people would be crammed in there.  And from there we were 

sent to a huge fortress called Drasnacasenk, to
 the attic.  It was a huge attic and it 
was airless, it was hot, it was dark.  In 
fact, I was there recently and it looked 
exactly the same way.  Some people started 
to jump out of thos
e little windows.  
My father saw one day a ma n from my 
transport hanging out of the window.  He 
said how can you do that?   And then he 
promised him he wouldn™t do it again and 
the next day he was dead in the cour
tyard.  I remember stumbling over dead 
bodies.  There were some  white sheets c
overing some  things–I mean there were 
bodies underneath. 
 

Q: This was in the attic? 

 

A: In the attic.  It was really very–I m
ean we had nothing.  We  were sleeping on the 
stone floor.  I reme mber one good soul 
who came  to us, a Czech woma n, who had 
never seen us before and she asked some  peopl
e if there is a child in the transport.  

 
 
10
So the fingers pointed towards me .  L
ook, I know a room in this fortress where 
they have the children and 
ma ybe it would be better fo
r you to be there.  Of 
course I di dn™t want to go because I–
there were so ma ny thousands of people 
walking around in this attic and also in 
the whole fortress was a huge area and all 
speaking all different languages, mos tly
 Czech, some  Ger man and I was really 
afraid to be left alone.  I 
just wanted to be together 
with my parents.  Everything 
was so strange.  I mean there was very
 little area, just a small area where you 
could wash yourself.  It was like a p
ublic room a nd everybody was rushing 
around and screaming and nervous and sta
nding wa iting for the food and always 
orders being given and everybody was just hopeless and walking aiml essly 
around.  I mean you were just in like Dante™
s Infe rno.  That™s what it looked like.  
And I went into that little room a
nd s he gave me , this Mrs. Rinder, who 
incident ally died in Auschwitz with he r 
entire family.  She had a little son by the 

name  of Tommy who was about a year or 
two younger than I.  She gave me  part 
of her son™s ma ttress.  There was like diffe
rent parts of the ma ttress.  Either she 
cut it or whatever, she gave me  a piece a part of a ma ttress that I could have  

something to sleep on in that little childre
n™s, in the children™s room.  In there 

they had double deck beds.  Many of the ch
ildren were sick with scarlet fever and 
of course I caught it too very shortly afterw
ards.  I reme mber we used to go in the 
morning, before I was sick, we used to 
line up in the courtyard and they ma rched 
us around.  I mean they tried a little b
it to keep us busy.  I reme mber how I  
learne d to count in Czech because each of 
us had to count [1-10 in Czech she is 
saying] that™s how I learned to count to 10. 
 

Q: Who is watching over you? 

 
A: Jewish people were watching over us.  
But I got so home sick that I reme mber 
when I got sick, I mean actually sick with
 scarlet fever, there was an epidemic 
there at that time and I caught it i
mmediately.  And after about 10-12 days, 
whatever the incubation period was,. I had it
.  And I was, I had a very high fever, 
it must have been 102-103 fever and I trie
d to locate my parents and to find them 
in this maze of people it was incredible.  I 
just ran away from the room and I went 
up to the attic and I stumbled over everyone
 and I did find my  parents.  But soon 
afterwards I was taken to the, what wa
s called the so-called ﬁhospitalﬂ.  And it 
was a building with rooms and they did have some  beds there.  But there were so 

ma ny sick children that it was called the [Hoen ___________ hospital.  Not only 
for children, but it was also for adults. 
 They had a separate area for children.  
And there were two children
 in every bed.  Some of 
them were sleeping in the 
floor.  The walls were covered with flies. 
 There was only one small, either one or 
two small windows that I reme mber that 
you had to climb up to see your parents 
because the parents were not
 allowed to come  inside because it was an isol ation 
area and we had a certain whistle that my
 father used to have like [and she 
demonstrated it].  When I heard that I kne
w it was my father outside and I™d climb 

up to that window and some  people would help me .  They would lift me  up that I 

could see my parents and scream out to 
them.  And the Czech children also they 

would scream up to their parents.  They would say ma leno kingle, ma leno kingle. 

 
 
11
Come  to the small window.  That was in 
Czech.  I reme mber these things that I 
didn™t know what they were saying, but now I know what it was. 
 
Q: Was your doll with you in the hospital?   

 

A: The doll was not with me  in the hospita
l, no.  I could not take anything.  And I 
stayed in the hospital from the end of 
August to December and I had a va riety of 
illnesses, double mi ddle ear infection, I had jaundice and measles, one after the 

other.  I mean I was supposed to die.  Th
e doctors already told me  parents that it 
was really very hopeless, I had lost my 
voice already and I was covered with sores 
all over from the dirt.  Nobody washed me
.  I couldn™t take care of myse lf and 
whatever little food I had I couldn™t eat becau
se I was so full of fever all the time, 
I didn™t know what to do with it and I had 
trouble washing myself and very little 
water.  There was really very little car
e.  I mean there were some  very good 

nurses there.  They had some  wonderful 
doctors, but very little me dicine.  There 
were just too ma ny children.  I shared 
my bed with a younger child who wet the 

bed all the time so the bed was constan
tly soiled, and I was in this wet be d 

constantly.  So finally I got
 out.  But in the meantime, transports I had heard were 
leaving for the East.  We  were shipped out 
and we were very afraid that we would 

be separated from our parents. 
 

Q: You were still seeing you
r parents during this time? 
 

A: Only through the window.  They we re not allowe d in. 

 

Q: Every day you would see them or– 
 
A: Yes, I think most every day they woul
d come.  But in the me antime my mother 
had to start working.  She worked at firs
t to work in washing typhus laundry.  In 
the meantime also they were shipped to a
nother area of the camp for disabled war 
veterans.  They were in the room with
 ma ybe 30 people, double deck bunk beds 
of course.  No furniture.  Nothing.  There was one small oven for the winter.  I 

reme mber when I was released from the 
hospital, my hair had been cut before 
because I was covered by lice and almost 
compl e tely cut off and they dunked me  
in some  kind of infecting solution in a pa
il like, a little pail 
whatever it was to 
clean me  up a little bit.  A
nd they it was cold.  I reme mber when I was released it 
was just before my, it was my eighth birthday and that was December 31, 1942 

because in August of 1942 were sent out. 
 I was eight by then.  And then came a 
call to this room of disabled war vete
rans where men and women slept together 
and the three of us slept on 
the top bunk bed and we stayed there also some  ti me ; 
a few months more and then we were sh
ipped out again.  Moved to another room 
on the same  block.  Also where the disabled
 war veterans lived to a little room 

with another fa mily from Berlin.  They
 had also a daughter exactly my age who 
was two mo nths older.  Her 
birthday was on October 21.  I reme mber it very well.  
Their name  was Abraham.  And the father was also a disabled war veteran.  He 

walked with a limp.  And the father was half Jewish.  The mother, the father™s 

 
 
12
mother was non-Jewish and the father was.
  That™s why the name  Abraham.  And 
the mother, Ruth™s mother was comp letely Jewish.  But Ruth was brought up as a 
devout Christian.  She wa s never brought up as a Jew.  And I reme mber how she 

prayed.  She would always fold her ha
nds and she was not–and that was very 
strange to me because Jewish people do 
not do that.  They had some  services, 

some  Christian services there too.  We
 had some  people in Terezin of mi xed 

ma rriages (Misch–) [mischlinge] and she attended some  of those services with 
her father and her father ma de sure that 
she was not brought up as a Jew.  And he 
was very proud of that.  Although she was 
basically Jewish, because the mother 

was completely Jewish.  Her name  was 
Ruth Abraham fro m Berlin.  Now we 
lived with them for more than a year in 
the small, tiny, tiny little room where six 
people lived.  I mean three of us and th
ree of them until ™44. 
 When, I mean there 
were transports to Auschwitz ma ny,
 many times  during that time and the 
transpor ts we re selected according to the whims of the SS.  Always around 1,000 

people.  And whenever Eichma nn c a me  
to the camp, you knew very well that 
another transport would go.  Many more tran
sports would go.  Ruth and I attended 
the underground classes.  The so-called be
shefticum classes which were held in 
different areas, some times in the children™s home, some ti me s in a barracks.  We  

both attended those and we didn™t have 
official school books and really not 
official teachers.  We  were taught by pe
ople who reme mber ed anything.  I had for 

instance some  English lessons.  Some
 people who reme mbe r ed English, or 
Hebrew or whatever they could teach us. 
 Our parents also they drilled us to do 
the times table, for inst ance.  It was very
 important to keep our mi nds a little bit 
busy and to learn poems.  For instance, 
Ruth™s father was a very good poet and he 
made her recite poems.  I mean to me
morize these poems.  The same with my 
mother.  She was a good poet too and you 
always for birthdays, that was our 
birthday gift to our parents to recite a poem.  
 

Q: Do you remember a poem you recited? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber, not really.  I don™t reme mb
er at this point. 
 My birthdays were 
celebrated in a fashion, for instance, I got
 a new outfit for my  doll sewn from rags 
or I got a small potato cake the si ze of a 
child™s palm with a tiny hint of sugar on 
it, just made from a mas hed potato.  Potato
es were like diamonds.  In fact, I wrote 
in my book, I am star about diamonds on 
the snow, how my father had gotten 
some  potatoes.  He would go around, my 
father didn™t have an official job.  
Sometimes he would get some coal dust and 
he would bring it to 
the old people.  I 
mean they couldn™t get it for themselves for the, you know for the heating of the 

small ovens and they would give hi m a piece of br ead for it or some  potatoes.  

[End of side  1. Set counter to zero for side
 2].  It was really forbidden.  You could 
be sent out either to a small fortress 
which was a prison for the prison about a 
mile away or be sent to Auschwitz imme
diately if you were caught.  Because in 
the camp we  had the ghetto police, ma inly, actually ma de up of Jewish people 

who were policing the area.  Also 
you had surrounding the camp you had the 
Germans or Czech gendarme s guarding the camp, arme d with guns.  Then I 
reme mber she had gotten some  of thes
e potatoes and we had a few pounds of 

 
 
13
these and they were really like diamonds
 because we did not get enough food.  I 
mean the rations were very small.  I don™t ha
ve to, I believe, go into it.  I mean we 
know what concentration camp food wa
s like and so a potato became the 
ma instay or an extra portion of soup, watery
 soup that we got.  Of course in the 
morning it was just a murky liqui d called co
ffee.  We  had to stand three time s a 
day in line in the big fortre
ss courtyards to
 get our food 
 

Q: You would stand in line? 

 

A: I would stand in line, too.  Yes.  In
 fact, the children™s 
kitchen was some where 
else from the adults and the food was very much the same .  I mean children did 

not get very much more.  I mean there was 
hardly ever any milk, and if there was, 
it was for, it was so watered down or ch
ildren with TB and things like that who 
got some times a little bit more.  Almost
 everybody had it anyway.  And there was 
a rumor going around that we were going to
 have an inspection in our block and 
the inspection was by wome n, ausewi ber they
 called them.  An especially very 
mean SS wome n who would search the 
area.  We  would have to leave the 
buildings and if even one cigarette or 
one potato would be found, that would be 
the end.  So we were sleeping on the potat oes and we didn™t know what to do with 

these potatoes.  So my fa
ther found a plan and he f
ound an old suitcase and put 
some  of these potatoes in and was the death of night and you actually a curfew.  

You weren™t supposed to be out of the houses and the lights we re supposed to be 

out.  There was a full moon.  So he had a pl
an to put these potatoes under a pile of 
rags, that they should not freeze.  In th
e, what was called die soigelings he im 
where some  of the babies were kept in th
is building and in the courtyard there was 
this big heap of rags.  And he took–in th
e mi ddle of the night he ran out and he 
fell and all of the potatoes were on the s
now.  So he picked them up and he hid 
them under this pile of rags.  Now in the meantime, these wome n ca me  a nd we 

were told to get out of the houses and a
ssemble.  And I reme mber I was so afraid 
with my doll that one of them would break
 him, I don™t reme mber if I left the doll 
there or if I took the doll with me .  Bu
t it was dangerous take anything with you 
because they thought you were hiding so
me thing and that™s how we saved, and 

then a day later when the coast was 
clear; they didn™t find anything, then 
they–we got the potatoes b
ack.  I reme mber the worst day for me was a day in 
1943.  It was Nove mber 11.  The rumor went around that people were mi ssing; 

that people had escaped.  And perhaps some
 people did escape.  But of course it 
was very hard to get out because you had to jump from the high walls.  And if you 

did, you broke most of your bones and who would help you then.  And even if 

you did get out in one piece, who would help you when you got out?   People 

didn™t know anybody on the outside to give 
you some  food or  where to go, etc.  
and I mean you had the SS guarding the pla
ce, so it was very difficult.  And we 
were herded out one cold Nove mber 
morning.  Always some thing happened 

between 9
th
, 10, or 11
th
 of Nove mber, starting from Kristallnacht on.  Every 
Nove mber 9
th
, 10
th
, 11
th
, we were always afraid some thing terrible would happen 
to us.  We  were herded outside of the 
camp to a place called Bauschewitz Kastle, 
the Bauschewitz Revine.  And everybody in
 the camp had to go.  Sick or half-

 
 
14
dead, everybody was ma rched out.  And we 
were standing in little groups and I 
reme mber Heindel, one of the worst 
and meanest SS me n kept on walking around 
and counting and beating people when they
 lost their way an
d we didn™t get food 
all day.  There were no bathrooms there.  
It was just a horrible, horrible day.  It 
was now I know what was supposed to happe
n on that day.  I think that they 
really did not only want to 
count us.  Probably what they
 wanted to do is either 
shoot down, Babi Yar style or send the whol
e transport to Auschwitz on that day.  
Because news had leaked out to the Britis
h radio.  And that we were all standing 

there, about 50,000-60,000 people.  It was rain
ing.  I reme mb er our feet sank into 
the mud.  It was just an awful day.  Mi
ce were running around in that field and 
that news had leaked out and consequently
 orders came from Berlin to let us go 
back to the camp.  And we went back 
in the death of night, ma ybe 11:00-12:00  
And they were beating us.  We  were hol
ding on to each other.  They said no.  
Men and wome n should be separate.  We  
wouldn™t let go of each other.  My 
mother was beaten up very badly that day. 
 One of the butts of a rifle went right 
into my mot her™s back because we would not sepa rate.  We  were holdi ng on to 

each other and we went back to the ca
mp.  And s oon afterwards you had this 
commission from the Red Cross.  And I reme mber it ve ry well.  The whole place 

had to be cleaned up.  Certain str
eets had signs on them–To School–To 
Playground.  A band shell was erected in the 
park, a park that we were never even 

allowed to go to and children were given some  be tter food just as the commi ssion 

went by.  I think I saw the commission but 
we were not allowed to go out of our 
houses.  I just saw them from far away.  
A film was ma de at that time to show 
supposedly the good conditions of the place.  Soon afterwards when the 

commission had left, everything went back
 to where it was before.  And the 
transports began again.  In fact, the worst 
transports were in 1944, in the fall.  It 
was during the High Holidays in September and October.  And I reme mb er how 

the people even fasted on Yom Kippur a
nd afterwards went on the transport.  I 
reme mber how they put on their boots, etc. 
and prayed with their last breathes, so 
to speak, God Help Us.  I reme mber one
 of the prayers Alvenu Malkenu, God 
Help Us.  I mean they did not know where 
they were really going that this was a 
worse place even than where we were.  
That this was going to be their death.  
They did not know it, but you always feared things would be worse some where 

else.  We  we re not told about Auschw
itz, although the camp elders did know 
about it. [Leobeken] the people knew a
bout this pl ace–knew about Auschwitz.  
And it was that time  when Mrs. Rinder 
and her whole fa mily was shipped out.  I 
mean the camp was almost completely empt
y.  Ruth and her parents were shipped 
out.  Just before they were shipped out, 
all of the disabled war veterans had to go 

the SS headquarters and the selection took 
place.  And my father when he came 
home  he said ﬁ Well I wa s told to go 
the girl with the typewriter, and I saw 
her–them put a red circle around our name , 
and I think we don™t have to goﬂ.  
And surely enough, that™s what it was. 
 And the Abrahams, who had–I mean 
they were really not even...I mean he wa
s half Jewish, they should have helped 
him. And my father said ﬁ Why di
dn™t you tell him, why didn™t you do 
some thing? ﬂ  He said ﬁWell, you are all goi
ng to come  sooner or later, wherever 
we™re goingﬂ.  And that™s it. So the w
hole fa mily was sent to Auschwitz.  I 

 
 
15
reme mber, for instance, disabled war vete
rans who had very important parts, I 
don™t need to go into certain things, genita
ls shot off.  I re me mber one who even 
took his, my father told me , he droppe
d his pants to show them that he was 
wounded so badly and he had all these cat
heters in and out and even he was 
shipped off to Auschwitz.  I mean the selection wa s very brutal and you really 
were not safe  just because you were a disa
bled war veteran or even if you were a 
highly decorated war veteran.  I mean there 
were transports with EK-1 Iron Cross, 

one transports who were shipped out 
in mass or sometimes only doctors, 
some ti me s.  It depended exactly what
 they wanted.  Old people, young people, 
whatever it was.  And I reme mber also dur
ing the–to transgress a little bit.  Some 

things that come back to me.  I mean 
that was really the saddest time for me 
because I had really loved my
 girlfriend.  We were like 
two sisters and before she 
went, we had identical dolls and she gave me – 
 

Q: She had a Ma rlene doll? 

 

A: She had the same  doll I had.  Exactly the same  kind and before she left, she gave 
me  her doll™s clothing that her mother had se
wn for her.  And I think I still have a 
few things left from that. 
 

Q: What was her doll™s name ?  

 

A: That I don™t reme mber, but she gave me
 her doll™s clothing.  She said, you take 
care of it for me .  And one of the things 
that I reme mber was seeing this meanest 
SS ma n Hei ndel.  I reme mber going with my
 father in the cour tyard and there was 
a tree with some  kind of berries on it. 
 But I mean we never had any food.  My 
father said come  on, pick some thing.  And 
as soon as I started to pick some thing 
Heindel came into this courtyard and we t
hought, that™s it.  We would be shot.  I 
saw Eichma nn.  He walked into the children™s quarters where I had my 
underground classes and I reme mber hiding th
e little notebook that I had.  I hid it 
under a table.  And I reme mber when he walked in, there were about three of 

them–three or four of them, we were really
 not supposed to look at their faces.  It 
was forbidden to look into an SS ma n™s face.  You had to have  your head bowed. 
 

Q: Who told you that? 

 

A: We were told by a teacher.  And it wa s a law.  I mean whenever you walked o the 
street, you were never supposed to look at
 an SS ma n.  Your head had to be 
bowed.  You would–they should not ma ke
 any eye contact.  But knew it was 

Eichmann.  I mean I looked up a little bit 
and, you know, I was told later that one 
of them was .  We  were told to be comple
tely quiet.  But one of the saddest things 
that I reme mber was when my grandmot
her was shipped out on the transport.  

That is some thing and today that we™re ma
king this tape, is her birthday, and that 
is a day that we keep as a me morial b
ecause we do not know when she was shot. 
This is April 11.  And we light a candle for her every April 11.  That is her 

me morial.  I reme mber when she was in the transport and how we went to 

 
 
16
Stuttgart before she was transported in th
e railway station.  As I said I had the 
travel papers that I could be there with 
my father.  And she slowly, slowly went 
down the train station.  Of course, the 
night before my mother and her said 
goodbye and it was just the most tearful thing.  So me how she knew that this was 
going to be a finality.  And how she sl
owly went down the steps and I would 
never see her again.  She sent a few cards fr
om the trip to Riga and we still have 
them today and she writes on them  ﬁwith 
God™s help we™ll see each other again.  

I love you,ﬂ you know, your Mother and so 
forth.  She probably had to dig her 
own grave so we heard and she was shot
 by Einsatzgruppen, these ma ssive killing 
forces in probably what was called the Rhumbellee Forest  near Riga a few weeks 
after she had arrived in Ri ga in Latvia.  
And that was it.  My aunt and uncle had 

lived in Frankfurt and they were ship
ped out also during that time, around 1941.  
First to a camp called Gurst cau de Gurs
t  in France.  We  we re–all my whole 
village where I was born were shipped–I 
mean the ones who did not make it to 
America, or some where else, went to Ca
u de Gurst in France.  And from t here 
they were shipped out to 
different places; to Auschwitz and so forth.  And my 
aunt and uncle were shipped to Lodz to the Lodz Ghetto, Litzma nstadt.  We  still 
have also a little note that they wrote in
 script.  They said ungroff, meaning in 
Hebrew gruff means hunger.  Uncle hungerhas come .  You know
, to tell us we 
should send packages and at that time
, we could still in 1941 we could send 
packages to the ghetto in Lodz in Poland.  
And we even have a little note that they 
did receive some thing.  And one my  aunt
 scribbled that she became a widow [and 
in german] in small letters that  widow 
on it in script-like and fr om there my 

cousin and her mother–my uncle died in 
the Lodz Ghetto and they were shipped 
out–I really don™t know where.  It
 could be Chelmno, I believe  
 they were gassed in Chelmno.  And of 
course we lost ma ny more people in the 
war but those were the closest.  Many
 more.  Many, ma ny more.  More than 13 
people at least.  When we came back from the camp, when we finally liberated, 

May 8, 1945, I reme mbe r  the transports ha
d just before had come  from ot her 
camps because Eichma nn wanted to exterminate the last Jew living and gas 
chambers had been built already in Te re
zin.  Only the doors had been mi ssing.  It 

was in the last days of th
e war and people were shipped in from Auschwitz, from 
Riga, from a ll over the place on death ma rches.  And I reme mb er how these poor 

people came.  They were barefoot, they we
re in rags, they looked like skeletons 

and then finally it dawned on us what ha d been going on the other camps .  It had 

been a secret to us that gas chambers and 
places like that existed.  I mean we were 
starving in the camp, but we we
re not killed in Terezin. 
 

Q: Did you get any letters fr
om Auschwi t z from anybody? 
 

A: Nobody.  Nobody.  Nobody.  Then the last day of the war I reme mber it was 
evening and I was kind of a precocious child
 and I climbed the barricade.  And all 
of a sudden to see what was going on becau
se I saw a lot of move me nt–I heard a 
lot of move ment–trucks moving outside of
 the camp.  And bits of burnt paper 
flying through the air.  And they were
 burning the documents because the Nazis 
were living right outside of the camp;  the 
personnel.  And all of a sudden I heard a 

 
 
17
tremendous noise and I touched my head to 
see if my head had blown off.  And a 
hand grenade had been thrown into the camp just a few houses away and I mean it 
nearly killed me .  They were throwing ha
nd grenades a few–as they we re leaving 
the camp.  And then my father said we  must find a hiding place.  I was a soldier in 

World Wa r 1, and I know how these things 
are.  We must go underground.  So we 
found a cellar, a dark cellar and somebody ha
d a tiny little candle and we were all 
huddling there and waiting and waiting.  A
nd about ten mi nutes to nine some body 
went upstairs to see what was going on.  
And he said the Russians are here, we 
are liberated.  And that was a tremendous
 relief, but we could not leave the camp 

because we had a treme ndous typhoid epidemic.  Then we waited for a bus to 

come  to pick up from St uttgart–they pi
cked up out of a transport of about 1,200 
people, 13 people had survived.  And of 
course I was the youngest.  My parents 
and myself we had survived out of those 
13.  We  went back to–we were first in a 
DP ca mp in Stuttgart and then we went 
back to my grandmother™s house.  People 
of course had lived in it a
nd they prepared a room for us.  Then we went to the 
Mayor and lo and behold my mother looke
d on the floor and our
 oriental carpet 
was in the Mayor™s office.  She heard a fa miliar chime and it was our clock that 

had found its way there.  The bedroom 
set had found its way to an SS ma n™s 
place.  And then in–we lived there about
 nine months and we came to America 
in May of 1946 on the Marie Perch the sec
ond Displaced Pe rson™s boat that came  
to the United States after the war. 
 

Q: When you weren™t in the underground sc
hool studying, what else would you be 
doing?  
 

A: Well, I would find the other children. 
 We  had a whole band of kids from the 
block that I lived on.  We  would go the 
garbage dump to find anything that was 
still edible.  We would take potato pee
lings–rotten potatoes, bring them home, 
we would pick dandelion l
eaves to ma ke a salad.  I mean we had no vinegar or 
anything like that.  We  never saw an egg in 
three years.  I never saw real  milk.  I 
never saw a piece of me a t  in three years.
  The bread was very poor bread, ma de, I 
believe out of chestnuts, part
 of it.  It spoiled very quickly and we ate it actually 
quite fast.  In fact, when we got the br
ead rations, my mother would ma ke a ma rk 
on the bread that we should not go furthe
r than that on that day, otherwise we 
would cut into the next day™s bread. 
We would have nothing left.  When a 
transport would come  in–an incomi ng tr
ansport, some ti me s these people brought 
some  onions  and some  garlic with them and was absolutely like diamonds, like 

potatoes were diamonds.  And some times 
we would find these people and they 

would give us a tiny little oni
on or a clove of garlic and 
we would put that on the  
bread.  And believe me , I didn™t brush my t
eeth for a few days just to keep that 
taste in my mouth.  I me an there was no t
oothpaste anyway, but just to keep clean 
some how.  I mean we had–we could not re
ally take showers.  Maybe once every 
eight, nine months or so
mething, some community s
howers.  Otherwise you got 
water from polluted wells and you drank 
the same water that you washed with, 
you drank too.  That™s why so ma ny people got
 sick.  And my  father was also in 
the garbage dump and he would find some ti me s some  boiled bones–some horse 

 
 
18
bones.  We  never had any real meat.  And 
he would cut the gristle off.  We would 
cook that again.  We  would ta
ke any fat that came out of
 that and take the gristle 
and eat it.  I reme mber my best fr iend–I
 mean how we had a little bit of gristle 
and my girlfriend was brought up in a ve
ry, very proper good home , how s he was 
so hungry that she stole some  of my –som
e of our gristle. 
 I saw it happening 
and–I mean she was not the type of person to steal from anybody. But when 

people are hungry, they will steal to stay 
alive.  So me  books had gotten into the 
camp, but they were not read.  They were us
ed as toilet paper.  That I remember.  
As toilet paper–books! 
 

Q: Did you as children like to dream 
and kind of fantasize.  Did you? 
 

A: Always.  Always.  We dreamt to ma ke
 up always about food.  we dreamt about 
food from day to night.  I mean who would 
think of the most lavish meal.  I mean 

there were cakes that were miles high 
with chocolate and whipped cream and in 
fact, when we got out of the camp, one of
 the first things some body brought was a 
big bowl of whipped cream and we di
dn™t know that our stomachs could not 
digest such a heavy meal.  But my mother 
and I, we just dug unt
o that.  We ate the 
whole thing up.  It was a bi
g dish of whipped cream.  
 

Q: And then you were sick 

 

A: And then we were sick.  Yes. 
 You could not digest such a thing. 
 

Q: Was there a time when you were pr
epared for a transport to Auschwitz? 
 
A: I think we had some  numbers at times–there were a few time s that we were and 
some how it was called off or some thing.  I 
mean there was nothing that you could 
do to get out of it, to stay 
out of a transport.  It was 
stri ctly on the whims of the SS 
who told the Jewish Elders like Epstein 
or we had different Elders, Adelstein, 
Epstein and the last one was Murmelstein. 
 This was the only one who survived.  
The others were killed in Auschwitz.  A
nd they were told ro prepare lists of 
people.  And whatever they wanted.  
And ma inly the children.  I me an the 
children were not supposed to live.  My 
life is a mi racle.  
I don™t know why I™m 
here today.  It was–people are always 
asking me, what did you do to survive?   I 
didn™t do anything!  It was pure luck!  Ab
solutely pure luck.  Not because  I was 
more beautiful or more intelligent.  I 
believe my girlfriend was a wonderful artist 
and was mu ch more gift than I, and she di d not ma ke it.  And so ma ny of us didn™t 
either.  There were very few children at th
e end of the war in Terezin.  They said 
that there we re about a hundred, perhaps th
ere were more.  Now they say perhaps 
a thousand.  I did not see a thousand childre
n after the war at li
beration time  that 
were under the age of, let™s say, 15 or 
14, young children I™m talking about.  Not 
teenagers.  But young children, let™s sa
y between–up to about 13 or so, very, 
very few were there at that time .  Ver y fe
w.  And most of us were sick at the end 
of the war.  When I came here I was also
 very sick and I–from ma lnutrition.  I 
was in the hospital ma ny years and it t
ook me  10 years of my  life to get myself 

 
 
19
together again physically, not me ntally.  
Mentally, I was, thank God, always very 
strong, but physically it t
ook ma ny, ma ny years and again– 
 
Q: All of those months w
ith infectious di seases. 
 

A: Yes, again loss of schooling.  I lost about 
eight years of schooli
ng in my life.  The 
first time  I ever really we nt to school, 
was high school, which I finished in three 
years, and then college.  I had to st op
 college also because I became sick again. 
That™s another story.  But I finished co
llege and I am a che mis t today.  I™ve done 
research with ma ny prominent doctors.  I worked with Meyer Friedman who was 
the father of cholesterol work; the father 
of the Type A personality, he coined that 
word.  I worked on that book when he wrote it. 
 

Q: Did he name  it after you? 

 

A: No, not quite, but I am a type A, I 
suppose.  I am very active in Holocaust 
lecturing and against prejudice; it has b
ecome really my life™s work besides my 
work at–my real work, I mean where I 
ma ke my  living.  I spend ma ny free–I 
mean whatever free time  I have I spend teaching the Holocaust and my voice 

against bigotry.  It is very important for me  to speak out.  And I do practice what I 

preach.  I live in a very integrated nei
ghborhood.  I live next d
oor to an Indian 
fa mily from Guyana, who are Hindu, and my
 next door neighbor on side is this 
Hindu fa mily and the other a Black fa mily 
from Haiti.  And we live very happily 

together.  We learn from each other and th
at is exactly perhaps why these things 
happened in Germany be cause people don™t–
they really didn™t want to know 
about other cultures and were persua
ded by one ridiculous man, I mean 
completely insane ma n, to follow his footsteps.  And I think if we learn more 

about other people, and I di
d travel a lot in my life already and learned about 
different cultures.  Moslem; I™ve been into so ma ny Mosques and Hindu temples 

and that we really are all one.  I wo
rk in a hospital and I know that all 
blood–we–blood has one color, and the co
lor is red.  Never ask did the blood 
come  from a  black person, an oriental 
person or whatever. It
 only depends on the 
blood type.  But all blood is red and it has 
the same  components for every people.  
 

Q: One other question.  Did you have any im
pression of the Soviet soldiers when you 
saw them?  
 

A: Well I reme mber they were quite rowdy.  I reme mber one of them, he saw me , 
and handed over the barricade a huge (to 
me  it seemed like huge) it probably was 
a regular piece of brea
d, with a mountain of butter.  
And I™ll ne ver forget the tast e 
of that first real piece of 
black bread, sinking my teeth in
to this delicious butter.  
That was a Russian soldier. 
 

Q: Did you contract typhoid? 

 

A: No.  I did not. 

 
 
20
 
Q: But you still had to stay 

 

A: Yes, we had to stay.  Because th
ere was a quarantine for the whole camp. 
 

Q: You said a bus came from Stuttgart? 

 

A: They sent a bus to 
pick up the survivors. 
 

Q: Stuttgar t sent  it? 

 

A: Stuttgart did, yes.  Yes.  Sent the bus. 
 Some months later in the summer.  July or 
some thing like that it was.  
In ™45, after our liberation.
