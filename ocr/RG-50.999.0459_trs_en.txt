use hisf luency in French and Germ an.  Youwi ll f indhim hereon Friday afternoons.  
 
 
W ith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our 
F i rs t Pe rs on
,  Mr.
 
Bob Behr.  
 
[Applause]   
 
 
Bob, tha
nk you so muchf or being with us today andfor your wi llingn ess tobeour 
F i rs t  Pe rs o n
.  
You have som uch to share with us inone short hour, so we're justgoing to go right into it, if that's 
OK.  You spent your childhood inBerlin bef ore the war began.  Yousaw the rise of  Naziis m  and the 
rise of  Hitler. Let's start with you telling us, Bob, about your life in the years thatpreceded 
Kristallnacht, or the Night of  BrokenGlass.  
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, itwas pretty average.  Bef ore1933, when Hitler cam e to power, it was a very 

normal, average life.  My f ather was an MD,m y m other was a housewif e, andbetweenthe years of  
1922 until 1933 therewere 11 years with a norm alfam ily lif e, nothing special.  
 
 
T heneverything changed. Inone day. T his is theamazing f eaturewhich I remem ber very 
clearly.  T he Nazis cam e to power on the 31st of  January 1933, and the man whohad threatened to 
Jews that he will create horrors anddoaway with them  suddenly had the power to implement this.  
 
 
So the years between1933, 30th of  January 1933, and what Bill m entioned, crystal night, we'll 
probably talk about that later, in that short span life changed so drastically.  
 
 
I don't know anything about you, but if  you gohome and you wouldf ind your hom etown, no 
m atter how big or how sm all, totally changed in attitude, thebuildings are the same, them onuments 
are the sam e, the sky is the same,everything is the same,except the attitude of your neighbors.  
People who used to greet youf riendly won't talk to youanym ore. Peop
l e  wh o
 
--
 
th e  city of B e rlin , 
ladies and gentlemen
 
--
 
how m any of  you have been to Berlin? W ow, we got two or threepeople. So 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

the city of  Berlin com pletely changed.  Notthe buildings,notthe monuments, not the trees, butthe 
attitude of  the people.  I
t became a city of hatred. Signs all over theplace saying " Jews not allowed," 
" Jews not wanted up here."   People with whom  we lived f or years,m y parents in peace and harmony, 

suddenly turn out to be our enem ies. 
 
 
Now, did they really believe this?  Did they really hate Jews?  Doesn't matter. T he outward 
sign of Nazi power to do away with the Jews, the Jews are ourm isf ortune,that was thething there.  
Ever ywhere.  
 
 
My f avorite sport was swim m ing.  T here's a couple things you needto swim .  Water. N
o t  a 
problem  with water.  But you need a pool. Big sign on the pool " Jews wi ll not swim  in this pool."   
 
 
School. T he teacher wanted us tohave am orning greeting by sayin g Heil Hitler when he 
com es in.  
 
 
W ell, a problem?  Yes, for Jewish kids it was a problem, because we were not allowed touse 
the German greeting the, Heil Hitler greeting. W e were notallowed to use it.  So whatdo you do? 
Do you stay in your seat and let the other kids stand up, ordo you stand up and raise yourhand 
anywa y and risk
 
punishm ent?  
 
 
W ell, the Nazis solved it.  They kickedus outof  school.  
 
 
I, ladies and gentlemen, grew up without aneducation.  My m othertaughtm e to readandwrite 
so I wasn't exactly ign orant,but anything else what you, your children learn in scho
ol today, none of  

th is.  
 
 
I came to Am erica withoutany education. T ook m yf irst GED test whenI arrived. T hat was m y 
beginning.  So lif ebefore crystal night was not that we were beaten up all the tim e.W e were 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

m aligned. W e were made to be outcasts. 
 
Picture yourself  wherever you com ef rom , and suddenly 
your neighbors don't talk to you anym ore.  You haven'tdoneanything.  You haven'thurt them .  But 
they won't talk to you.  They won't associate.  
 
 
It became a city f ull of  antagonism , of  hatred, of  p
ersecution indirectly, m entally.  So even 
though you were niceandbehaved yourself ,it didn'tmakeany difference.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,before we move on to Kristallnacht, which I want to do and ask you acouple of  

questions, youdescribed to me your motheras adevoted German. W ill you say a little bitabout 
that?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yes. It's not justm y m other. My biological f ather and m y mother were, f irst of  all, 

Germ ans. Secondly, they were Germ ans. Thirdly, they were Germans. And only then were
 
they 
Jewish.  So you can easily see thepriority of m y biological father aswell as m y stepf ather. Both 

served in the em peror's arm y, volunteered,became officers.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the FirstW orldW ar?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  In the First W orldW ar. And got decorated with theIron Cross.  So that gives you a 
picture of what the Germ ans
 
--
 
how m y parents felt about the Germans.  
 
 
T hat was it. T hat wasour country, that was our language, that was our culture, that's what we 
were. W e were Germans.  And suddenly we were told we don't want you to be Germans.W edon't 
gi ve a darn what youthink and what you do.W edonot want you!  
 
 
Letm e give you just one practical example. How m any of you have an American passport?  
T hank you. W e had a Germ an passport, 
andin Septem berof 1934 when the Nazis had their annual 
rally they took away our citizenship, just like itwas a stroke of apen. W e were no longer citizens.  

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

W e were residents without any legal rights to vote, toparticipate,nothing.  
 
 
It was a real blow to my f ather, who hadfoughtf orthat very country which now tells him , inno 
uncertain term s,W edon't want you. And there was nothing we could do about it.  Nothing. W e were 
hopeless.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob, in 1936, I believe, you were sent toSweden,but you would come back I think a 

couple years later. Tell us about going there,but then what was special about you com ingback, 
because you were one of  few that cam e back.  
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, there's a slightm istake. I wasn't sent.  If you mean
 
by sent
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  By your mother, yes, right.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  By m y parents,OK.T here was a Jewish philanthropist who opened up aboarding 

school in the city of Lund, which is in southern Sweden.  Heopened up a boarding schoolfor German 
Je w
ish kids who couldnot getaneducation in Germany.  
 
 
My m other, it'sa long story, was able to enroll and,bingo, I was outof  Germ any, in Sweden, 
which was a neutral country, which was f riendly, and I was out.  I was f ree.  No m ore. 
 
 
T hat whole happiness lasted six m onths.  
 
 
W henm y m other went to the bank toexchange them oney, the Germ an marks into Swedish 
kroner, the clerk told her,W edon'tdo this anym ore. T he Germ an governm ent has different priority.  

T hey need what they call hard currency, and
 
for other things,between you and I, toprepare for war.  
But of course,hedidn't say that. He just said,W e got other priorities.  Guess what
 
--
 
the school 
closed in six m onths and we were back where we started.  
 
 
T here was anopportunity to stay in Swedenbecause some Swedish f am ily said if the school 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD

closes we'll take the kids and they can stay here. T hey don'thave to go back toGermany.  
 
 
W ell,m y m other was the opposite,and I'm not going to go intom y fam ily history, butm y 
m other wanted me to com e home.  Six months later, I was back in Germ any, and beginning of  1937, 

and if anything thingshave gotten worse.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You are only one of two of  100 students who cam eback to Germany?  
 
>> Bob Behr: T hat's right. T wo m others, two parents decided they want their kids back hom e. T hey 
don't wantthem  staying in Sweden with af am ily they don't know.  So Ihad to com eback.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob, the nightof  November9
-
10,1938, is thenight that we call Kristallnacht, orthe 
Nigh t  o f  B ro
ken Glass.  Over thatnight thousandsof  Jewish businesses, homes and synagogues 
were vandalized and destroyed.  It was a horrif ic night. T housandsof m en were roundedup and 
arrested.  
 
 
W hat was the im pact for you of  Kristallnacht,you and yourfam ily? 
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, I can give you two.  First of  all, it was am ental shock. I m ean, wherewe li ved 
there were som e Jewis h stores. T he windows  were sm ashed,themerchandise was stolen. W ehad 
about,oh,I would say threeorf our blocksf rom  where we live was a synagogue, which wa s burning, 
which was a very wel l
-
known synagogue.  Itwas burning, where the peopletook the holy scripture of 
the Jews, threw it on the floor,made the Germ ans walk across it. Thef lames were spreading out. I 

r e m em be r  t h at .
  
 
 
T here weref iremen there, but their instructions were only to protect the Christian homes 
nearby.  Let the synagogue burn to the ground, som uch thebetter.  
 
 
So it was a nightthat physicall y, som ething happened physicall y to m e?  No.  My m other kept
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

m ehom ethat day, and I wasn't allowed to goto work, butphysically I wasn't harmed.  
 
 
But what did harm m e, they arrested 30,000 Jews all over Germ any, eeny
-
m eeny
-
m in y
-
m o , off  
to a concentration camp. T he concentration cam p was oneexit.  Thatm eans f rom the camp tothe 
ship.  You couldn't go home, if  you couldn't get out; youhad to stay in the cam p. 
 
 
My biological f ather was one of those 30,000people, andI never saw him  again.  Hedid get 
out, but I m issed him.  
 
 
Interestingly enough, while I was on a shipto com e to Am erica hedied. It was a real tragedy.  
I was looking forward to being with him , see him  again, get him healthy. W hen I got to New
 
Yo r k ,  
there was a wom an with whom  he becam ef riendsand said, Yourf ather justdied.  
 
 
So he got very ill on that night.  And Idon't know, do you want to go into Kristallnacht, whatit 
was other than
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  No, let's talk a little bitm ore, if  youdon'tm ind, about its personal effect onyou and 

your m other.  Yourm other was som ewhatf inancially OK until then, Ibelieve. T hat was devastating 
f inancially for you.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah, let me give you a practical exam ple.  If you know the story about Kristallnacht 

with the SS, the German em bassy off icial inParis who got shotby a Jewish kid, who was nothing 
m orethan a student, and the Nazis used that, like I said, to burn thesynagogue, to rob thestores and 
so  f o rth.  
 
 
So what was interesting in thatthing, thattheGerm ans also inf lictedsomething which is not so 
we l l
-
known.  T he Germ ans told the Jewish comm unity all over Germ any that they had tocough up 1 
billion marks, and that's nota speech impedim ent. That isa billionm arks. Every Je w got a quota of  

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
10
 
how m uchhehad to contribute to the Germ an governm ent aspunishm entfor the as
sassination of  the 
Germ an em bassy off icial in Paris. 
 
 
W edid nothave thatm uch money.  My m other had to sell som e jewelr y to even make up the 
m oney tom eet our quota.  
 
 
So it gives you som e idea, andf rom  then on, if  we thoughtthat lif ewas bad before
 cryst a l 
night, it becam ea lot worse.  
 
 
T hoseof  you who have not been upstairs, let m e put a comm ercial in.  Upstairs onthef ourth 
f loor is a sm all video screen, which mostpeople walk right by because it isn'tf lamboyant, it isn't 
dramatic.  Buton that screen they have all the anti
-
Jewish m easures f rom  January 1933 till April 
1945.  It's an absolutely frightening pictureof Nazi punishmentof  the Jews.  
 

 
Now, before I leave this, when I talkedaboutthem oney we had to cough up, let me give you 
s o m e 
f igures. T he Germ an people in those days were 65m illion people. How m any Jews do you 
think were there? 500,000. T hat was it. T hat was the total numberof  Jewishf olks who were 
countedas Germ an citizens.  It was those 500,000 people who hadto cough up the money to give to 
the German governm ent.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,Kristallnacht was Novem ber1938. Thefollowing September 1939W orldW arII 

began with the Germ an invasion of Poland. Once the war was on and you're still in Berlinwith your 
m other and your stepfather, what was lif e likef or you oncethe war began,before
 
--
 
I want to leadup 
to your arrest later in 1942, but thef irst period of  the war.  
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, as Bill said, the war started inSeptem ber, and thenI want to give you som e 
psychological insight.  On September 1, theGerm ansm arched into Poland. OnSeptem ber 3, on 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

Sunday, theBritish and the French declaredwar on Germ any.  
 
 
My parents, and I remem ber that to this day,they were jubilant. They thought, My gosh, it wil l 
be 
six m onthsand theBritish and the Frenchwi ll defeat the Germ ans and we will be f ree. 
 
 
T hoseof  you who are interested in history, itwas just theopposite.Hitler won ever ything, 
ever ything until the battle of Stalingrad in 1943.  Heoccupiedall of  them.  
 
 
Som y parents were bitterly disappointed. T he Germ ans in Juneof 1940 were in Paris. They 
couldn't get to Paris in four years inW orldW ar I, just to give you som e idea.  And them ore the 

Germ ans won, the worse m y parentsfelt,becausethe disappointment was there.  
 
 
Now, personally, I was inducted intoforced labor.  Now,f orced labor is not slave labor. W e 
don'thave tim e to go into thediff erence. T rust m e,forced labor is you lived athom eand you went to 
work in the morning, not work of your choice, butthe work by assign m ent.  
 
 
W e were given the job of heavy labors, usually carr ying bricks on a construction site or 
carryin g coal in topeople who had central heating.  It was that typeof  thing.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're 17 years old atthis point when you started?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah. And thefuture lookedgrim m er and grim mer. The laws, we had to turn in our 
radio. W ehad to turn in our telephone.W e had to turn in the car, which we didn'thave, but if you 
hadone you had to turn it in. All of this without com pensation. They literally robbed us blind.  
 
Now, the war, of course, brought about rationing.  Everything was ra tioned.  Jews had a 
handicap right thereand then. First of all, whatever a Christian gotJews got half of  it.  If a
 
Ch ris t ia n  
got a pound of buttera week, we got 250 gram s. So we got half  of it.  
 
 
Furthermore, we were allowed to go shopping only at 4:00p.m . inthe evening. W ell, by that 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
12
 
tim ea lotof  thefood was gone.  Im ean, we could go thereand try to get som
e potatoes, which were 
not rationed,butby 4:00 they were long gone.  
 
 
For thef irst time, you experienced hunger.  You experienced literally notthef eeling that you 
hadenough to eat.  Itwas al ways short. W estruggled. W edidn't starve to death.  No, wedid not, 

but it was not a very pl easant existence.  And thefuture began to look very bad.  
 
 
T he Nazis kept increasing the oppressionfor us, and it's very diff icult f or m e to explainhow 
that was.  Everything was f orbidden.  You were not allowed to go to the movie theater.W e were not 
allowed to sit on a bench that wasn't paintedyello w.  If  in your m indyou have the question, How did 
they know you were Jewish?  You don't lookparticularly Jewish.  H ow do they know?  
 
 
T hey knew.  T he German birth certif icate, then and now, there's a line item about religion. You 
have tof ill out Protestant, Catholic, Hebrew, whatever the case may be.  So they had noproblem  
f inding Jews.  
 
 
T hen in Septem ber of 1940 came the inf am ous star. You had to wear a yellow
 
sta r with  the  
word " Jew"  sewn ontoyour clothing, and the law says if  you hide that thing or if  you go without it you 

wi ll be severely punished by going to a concentration cam p.  
 
 
So that gives you a picture how the tim e betweenthe beginning of the war in September 1939 
until we were arrested.  W eexisted. W edidn't live.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,before you were arrested, I think you weref orced outof  your hom e. T ell us 
where you went.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Oh, yeah.  W e lived inan apartm ent. W edidn't have enough money toever own a 
house in Berlin, which was for usmuch tooexpensive.  So we lived in anapartmenton the thirdf loor, 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
13
 
no elevator, but we lived there andhad lived therefor som e tim e.  
 
 
Oneday, m y m other gets a letterf rom the owner of the
 
building, and said that they had 
surve yed the Christianpeople who live in thebuilding, and they hadunanimously decided that they 
do not wish to live with  Jews under onehead.  So would youpleaseget out.  Inf act, we'll gi ve you 
two weeks tof ind another abode and you need to get out. 
 
 
W ell, it was a very difficult thingfor us tof ind, because we were notallowed to go and rent 
another apartm ent where there was one.  It had to be with a Jewish
-
owned apartment.  It had to be 
an apartm ent which was already owned by Jews, who had to move closer together so that we could 

ge t in .  
 
 
W as iteasy?  No, it wasn't. W ef inally f oundone, but of course it was terribly crowded, and not 
ver y pleasant living.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would continue in thesecircum stances until July of 1942, when you and your 
parents were arrested, your stepf atherand your m otherand you wer e sent toT heresienstadt. Tell us 
about thearrest, then going to Theresienstadt.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Bef ore Itell you aboutthearrest, letm e tell you the reason we were arrested.  

Because, that's one heck of a story.  
 
 
A lady m y m other knew f rom  God knows wh ere, Ihave no idea, and she cam e to her andsaid 
tom y m other, Lilly, whi ch is m y mother'sf irst name,Lilly, I need to get out of Germ any. 
 
I cannot live 
here anym ore. I have no relatives.  I'm all alone. I don'towe anybody anything.  How am  I going to 

get outof  Germany?  
 
 
It sohappenedthatm y m other knew a priestwho li ved in the city of Constance.W hen you get 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
14
 
a chance, you go home,
 
take an atlas, look at the city of Constance.  It's spitting distancef rom the 
Swiss border, which of course was the ideal place to be because it wasf reeand honorable, and 
anybody living in Switzerland was af ree person.  
 
 
Som y m other gave that lady the addressof  the priest.  Idon't know all the details, but suffice it 
to say that that lady we nt to Constance,m etthe priest, persuadedhim  somehow to bring her across 
theborderduring the night, and she was in Swit zerland.  She was f ree.  
 
 
So what did that wom an do?  She wants to show her appreciation.  She writes a postcard, 
which is thef irstm istake.  Youdon't write a postcard in a censorship country.  But she writes a 
postcard and describes, Lilly, guess where I am
 
--
 
I'm  inSwit zerland, I'm  having a good cup of coffee, 
and since it was July it's beautif ul weather. Then she writes a PS,W ithout you I would have never 

m ade it to be here. 
 
 
So now, if  you are gestapo censorship officer, thef irst thing you do you look at the stam p and 
the stamp is
 
f rom  the country of  Switzerland. T hen youput2 and2 together and seeing the wr iter of  
thatpostcard would never be in Switzerland if it hadn'tbeenfor the help of the recipient of the 

postcard.  So we were arrested.  
 
 
W e were arrested.  My m other was
 
put into awom an's prison.  My stepf atherand I were put 
into a male prison. And there we were, didn't know what's going to happentous.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your interrogation when youf irst wentto the jail.  You were beaten with 

a ruler, as I rem em ber, a steel rod.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah.  Iwas told to report to the police station thenext morning, and they beatm e up 

bef ore they putm e into jail, but I was bleeding.  Inthose days they had rulers, which were m ade of

steel,and these rulers
 
were used in schoolsand officesand everywh ere, and they used one of  those 
andthey beatm e, andthat was openedupon m y face.  So I had greatf oreboding.  Ididn'tknow what 
happened tom y m other and m y stepfather, but we wound up aspunishmentform y 
m ot her ' s  
assistance to that woman, we wound up inTheresienstadt.  
 
 
Now I got to pausefora moment and tell you, wh y did we not go to a killing camp?W hy didn't 
they gas us? W hy didn't they?  
 
 
In January of  1942, not July, bef ore, in January, the Nazis held abig m eeting, known asthe 
W inzig conf erence.  If you later want to know how that is spelled, I will write it f or you.  It isnothing 

m orethan a lake.T here was a big building, and inthat building theNazis held a conf erence.  
 
 
T hat, ladies and
 
gentlem en, was the one where they decidedonthef inal solution, which isa 
code word of killing.  They called it thef inal solution, once andfor all to get rid of all the Jews, we kill 
th em .  
 
 
T hem inutes of them eeting are retained. The Nazis honored, if  you wil l, in a YouT ube thing, 
which is ver y good.  If you are interested in it, it's called theW unzig conf erenceon YouTube.  
 
 
T he Germ ans being Germ ans, and very thorough and very detailed, they decided to kill all the 
Jews, but being Germans they had tof irstf ind out who is a Jew.  Do you think that's simple?  Your 
m other is Christian, your father is Christian, your grandf ather is Christian, your grandm other is 
Christian, but your great grandfather is Jewis h.  Now, what are you?  
 
 
Don't answer that. They wrestled with the idea. They had tof indout who is a Jew.  Once they 
got that one down, then the evacuation to the east started, andthe people, as you know six m illion of 

them , were killed.

In addition to def ining who is a Jew, they also de
cided that people, veterans of W orldW ar I 
who were decorated wi th the Iron Cross would not be gassed, they would be rem ovedf rom  society.  
T hey were put intoa concentration cam p where hopefully they woul d die, sooner or later,but they 
would not be sent 
to a gas chamber.  
 
 
Inm y case, that was the case.  My stepf atherwas a veteran, was anoff icer, was decorated, 
andhe was sent toT heresienstadt, which wa s nota killing camp.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're sent to Theresienstadt. T ell usaboutarriving there and what itwas like 
when you got there.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  In orderto understand the question, youneed to know a littlebit aboutT heresienstadt.  

I'll m ake that real short, and that is thefactthatT heresienstadt way back when, in the 1890s, was an 
A u s t ri a
-
Hungarian town, aGarrison town, big barracks, sm all buildings f or the relatives.  The 
A u s t ri a
-
Hungarian Monarchy went away in 1919. T hen the Czechs took it over. T he Czechs existed 
because the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia in March of 1939.  And
 
so, suddenly, there was an 
e m pty city.  
 

 
T he Nazis decided, who in them eantim eoccupied Czechoslovakia, that this is the idealplace 
to put all thepeople,all the Jews whom  they're not gassing, to conf ine themfrom  society, to isolate 

them  and keep them  separate f rom  thenormal hum an beings.  
 
 
So since m yf am ily m et that criteria, veteran,off icer, Iron Cross,blah, blah,blah, we were sent 
there.  
 
 
Now, the city of Theresienstadt,or Terezin, by the way, if  youever vi sit Prague there's a bus 
which goes down there and you can visit the cam p.  But the city hadapproxim ately 4,000 civil ian 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

17
 
people living there, Czech civilian people, which the Nazis evacuated and sent God knows where.  
 
 
So they hadthat em pty thing, and in that particular spacef or the4,000 people, they crammed 
60,000people. 60,000 people. Now, I'm  going to ask you a question.  How many of you like tobe 

alone som etim es, whether an hour or a day, som etimes? I want to see your hands.  All right.  
Ever ybody.  T hank you.  
 
 
T he reasonI'm asking this, because being alone inTheresienstadt with 60,000 people was an 
im possibility.  You were never alone. You were always with people. 
 
 
T he house we were bill eted in,m y m other, stepf ather and I, was a house completely stripped.  
T here was nofurniture.  T here was no
 
--
 
it didn't have a bathroom , because we hadanouthouse.W e 
hadno running water.  You had to goand pum p, and they putabout 50 to 55 people in that 
four
-
bedroom  house. Four
-
bedroom?  Four
-
room house.  So it was a terribly miserable room .  
Ever ybody was m iserable.  
 
 
People died. Theolder people, who were evacuated, died likef lies.  My first job,being young 
and strong, was collect dead bodies.  Now, I don't know anything about you, but I venture tosay that 

if and when you were conf ronted with death itprobably was a solem n occasion, a vie wing, a wake, 
som ething.  
 
 
Ours? W e collected dead bodies by throwing them ona cart, human
-
being
-
pulled cart, where 
threeof  us, two people to throw the bodiesand the other oneto steer.  Everything was m anual.  
 
 
Af ter a while, ladies and gentlem en, you becom e so hard about dead people that the only thing 
you cared,how full was the cart andhow high do I have to throw them ?  
 
 
Now, take that in your pipe and smoke it.  Imean, this isa lif e which isn't worth livin g.  T heonly

thing we saw blue was  the sky. W e couldn'tget out. W e were completely separatedf rom all 
comm unications.  No radio,of  course. No newspaper, of  course. Nothing. T he only thing we had 
plenty of  was rumors. 
 
God,did we have rumors.  Everybody knew som ebody who had another story.  
 
 
Do you know how we got news into a closedsociety?  It was only one source, and apretty 
good one: Newcom ers.  W e were arrested in July of  1942.  Somebody who came in Septem ber o
r 
Novem ber of 1942 was f rom the outside. T hat's how we got news.  
 
 
T hey knew stories about the war. W ehad no idea who was winning and who was losing.  It 
was ver y depressing, except for the newcom ers who told us what they knew bef ore they we re 

arrested
.  
 
 
So by 1943 the Nazis r ealized they had to dosom ething.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,before you go there, letm eask you two questions, if I can. As you said, you 
were young and in reasonably good health and strong.  How did your m otherand stepf ather m an
age 
during that sam e tim e?  
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell,my m otherexisted by doing laundry for the prisoners.  She was ordered to report 
to the laundry and wash clothing for the Nazis or clothingfor the prisoners.  
 
 
My stepf ather was used as thedoctor.  But when youthink, Aha, letm etell you som ething, a 
doctor without any medication. T here was no medication.W hatever little medication was sm uggled 
into the camp, with so many people, som any being sick.  
 
 
I remember talking to him , and that manalmost cried.  He said, I see all these people who 
couldbe helped with som e medication,but there wasn't any medication.  Jews don't deserve

m edication.  If they die, som uch the better. Save us the troubleof killing them .  
 
 
So it was that type of environm enthow
 
they lived there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you don'tm ind, Bob, I want you to share with us som ething you told me. In these 
extraordinarily horrific circum stances you're in, your stepfather gave you a lecture about not stealing.  
W ill you share that with us
?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah. W ell, we called it requisitioning. W e tried to requisition whatever we  could.  I 

hadthef ortunate tim e to work a little bit in a kitchen, and I sometimes took a pieceof  horse m eat 
af ter it was cooked, and took it home tom y parentsand said, Here's a piece of meat.  It'sstill warm .  
So you have a littlem ore to eat.  
 
 
My stepf ather, the good oldhonestGerman citizen, gave m e a lecture, and said,T hat is 
stealing.  Youm ay behelping us,but I wouldchokeonthat piece ofm eat 
bec au se  it  is  ille ga lly 
obtained, because you're taking it away f romtheother prisoners, the other prisoners whocouldhave 
hadthe pleasureof  getting a piece of thatm eat.  You took it away f rom them. You took itaway b y 
bringing it to us.  How do you think thatm akes usf eel?  
 
 
I got upset. I said, I know how it would m akem efeel. I said, Finally,  I got som ething decent to 
chew.  I wouldn't worry about thenext
-
door neighbor.  You can't.  You hadto worry aboutyourself , 
andthen your loved ones.  T here wasn't anything ethically about it. I had no qualm s stealing that 

pieceof m eat andbringing it to m y parents. Now, if  I had sold itonthe blackm arket, I would say, 
W ell, that'sprobably wrong.  But I didn'tdo that.  I gave it tom y m other andmy stepf atherso that 
they had som ething toeat. 
 
 
Should Ihavef elt guilty about it?  Youhave your opinion, I have m ine.  Ididn'tf eel guilty at all.

>> Bill Benson:  Bob, you began to tellus that eventually the Nazis would take youf rom  
T heresienst
adt, and they took you to a placecalledW ulkow.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah,W ulkow.  By 1943, late 1943, the Nazis began to get really wor ried that the 

cam p, soovercrowded, would be riddled withdiseases, and the Nazis were very af raid of diseases, 
typhoid, what have you.  
 
 
So I'm  going to take you a little bitback now.  Something happened in that tim eperiod which 
really aff ected me.  Forget concentration campf or a m inute. W ehave a war.  Your grandfathers were 
ver y active bom bing the helloutof  Berlin. T he British did it during the day, and your grandfathers 
cam e atnight in the7th Air Forceand bom bed.  
 
 
Am ong the buildings they bombed was abuilding where the SS headquarters was.  T he guy 
named Heim lich Himmler, the chief of  theSS, equal to abouta 
four
-
star general. Their headquarters 
was gone.  He was the guy who adm inistered all the concentration cam ps.  Headm inistered the 

m ilitary arm  of the SS. So he decided he's got tohave aheadquarters.  
 
 
He picked a pieceof  land, went to the German aut
horities and said, I want you to build m e a 
headquarters in that piece of land. And the Germ ans saidOK. 
 
 
T hen they went toTheresienstadt and said,W eneed volunteers to go to that place tobuild the 
headquartersf orthat guy.  And if I don'thaveenough volunteers, we have to draf tthem .  
 
 
T hen they put a sugar thing in there,and said, If  you volunteer, if  you volunteer we will not 
evacuateor what they called resettle yourf olks.  Resettle,everybody in the cam p knew that m eant 

death.  Nothing else,
 
nothing more,nothing less.  
 
 
How we knew, if  we have tim e I'll go into it,but right now I knew thatI didn't want m y parents to 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

21
 
be resettled, quote unquote.  Ineed to do something, andI volunteered to go there.  
 
 
S o W ulk o w is  a  lit t le  villa ge  in  wh a
t is now the Polish border, whichwas a big plot of grass, and 
that's wherehe wanted the headquarters, and that's where we were  supposed to build it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said that was one of the worst jobs you ever had.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  It was.  It was so bad and so cruel.  You see, letm e give you an exam ple what Im ean 
by cruel.  The guy who was the leader of theGerm ans, lieutenant colonel
 
--
 
no, that'snot true, he was 
a major, equivalent in the SS, named Franz Schtugar.  He was the cam p commander.  
 
 
W egotthere, and thecam p com mander was notonly leader, he was also a rabidanti
-
Se mite .  
He hated Jews, andnow he's got nothing butJews under him .  
 
 
He was ver y cruel, ver y determ ined. I want to give you anexam ple. T he Germans whoare 
f i gh t i n g t
he war, we're talking 1944 now, theGerm ans weref ighting a war and losing it . Ever since 
thebattle of Stalingrad thefate of the Germ an arm y turnedaround,and instead of winning they were 
lo s in g it .   
 
 
So he was already upset about that. So when we hadnothing todo, because the Germans 
hada war tof ight, they needed transport wounded, they needed transport ammunition.  So what 
happened is that they didn'thave rolling stock to bring building m aterials to that site. Sowe didn't 
have anything todo, so what are you going to do with 200
-
som e Jews and no work?  You tell them  to 
go to the barracks, sitdown, relax, wait till the next train com es. 
 
 
Not that guy.  He couldn't stand the idea that there were days we had nothing to do, because 
we  s im p ly d id
n't haveenough buildingm aterial.  So what do you dowith them ? W ell, he f ounda way.  
 
 
I'll gi ve you one example.  He gave usa bucket.  Now, letm eadd here quickly that we're

talking about November, December 1944.  Anybody who has been ever to Germany wi ll agree me 
that isnot exactly the best time of the year.  It's cold, it'sm iserable, it's horrible.  
 
 
So he gave us abucket and abrush, no gloves, and thenhem arched us into the woodsand 
said, So, I want you guys to wash the trees. W ash them  so
 
thatI do notf ind any dirt on atree.  
 
 
I don't care, ladies and gentlemen, how m any tim es you washa tree, if you want tof ind 
som ething you're going to f ind something, andf ind he did. T hen we were punished. Punished 
m eaning no dinner, standing outsideall night. Rem ember now, we'r e talking Novem ber, December, 
at times October.  It was freezing.  Not allowed to go to the bathroom . Pee
-
pee running down our 
pants andf reezing.  It was terrible.  
 

 
W ehad about 12or 14 wom en there who were supposed to do the cookingf or theprisoners, 
andhem adethem  lieon thef loor, andhe walked over them  so hewouldn't get his bootsdirty.  
 

 
All of  thistime we didn't know what's going on. W e hadno idea.  And I got very sick.  I had 
what they call invertigo , a
 
vitam indef iciency disease, whichm anifests in a very ugl y wa y.  You get big 
blotches all over your body, ahigh tem perature, your clothing stickson you.  Ugly.  Ugl y is t he only 
word I canf ind.  
 
 
No m edication. W hatyou need is som e lemon, somef resh, butof course there wasn'tany f or 
u s.   
 
Sof orthef irst time, ladies and gentlemen, and I want youhopef ully to understandm e,I gave up. I 

hadnot given up since 1933. I have alwa ys told m yself  I will not succum b, I will li ve to tell people like 
yo u
 
the story of  whatthe Nazis did. But suddenly I couldn'tanym ore.  I was weak.  Ihadno guts left.  
And I said,W ell, I guess m y tim ehas come. I'm  going to throw in the towel.  Iffate wantsthat Idie, 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

23
 
so  b e it.  
 
 
Now, m ay I tell the rest of the story? W hy didn't it happen? W hat took place?  
 
 
About Novem ber or Decem ber, Idon't really rem ember, I was standing at the barbed wire 
inside the camp looking out with anotherprisoner standing next tom e.  It was aSunday. Because we 
didn'thave to work.
  
 
 
W esaw som ething whi ch I didn'tunderstand,buthedid. W esaw a track of  Germ ans going, 
andhere comes the important point, goingf rom  east to west. T hey looked about asm iserable as we 
were looking inside the camp. They had anym eans of transportation. T hey hadno trucks.  They had 
horse
-
drawn carriages.  They had baby carriage.  And all was going f rom eastto west.  
 
 
Now, why did I m ention that? Because all this tim e,f rom  1941 when Germ an attacked Russia, 
the directions were f rom  west to east.
  
T he Germ ans kept winning the battles, occupying m oreand 
m oreterritory of  the Russians,until thebattle of  Stalingrad, which turned thefate around, and the 

Germ ans began tof lee.  
 
 
W hat we saw, I askedthe guy next tom e, Can you explain that?  
 
 
He  
said, Yes.T he Russian Arm y hasf inally reached Germ any.  T hey reoccupied everythi ng 
the Germanshadtaken away f rom them , and now it's tim etopay.  The Russian Arm y hitting the 

easternmost provinceof Germ any, which didn't exist anym ore, which was known
 
as East Prussia, 
andthe Germ ans were f leeingf rom  the Russian Arm y.  That is whatwe saw.  
 
 
So Ithought by m yself , as m iserableas I was, if the Russians are that close, if he is right wh at 
he explained tom e, if the Russians are that close Im ight as well hang in there. It couldn't last much 

longer, and it didn't.

>> Bill Benson: T ell us, Bob, about that.W ith the Russiansadvancing you were takenf rom W ulkow 
andthen sent back toTheresienstadt whereyou would becom e liberated.Tell usabout you
r  go i n g 
back toT heresienstadt, what youf ound with yourf am ily and then liberation.  
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, sim ply, the Russians reachedthe place wherewe were building the 

headquarters. It was never f inished. SotheGerm ans putus in cars,f reight cars,
 
and shipped us 
back toT heresienstadt.  
 
 
W earrived there about February 1945. W hatIf ound was m y parents alive.  My volunteering 
m ay have saved theirbeing resettled, quoteunquote, killed,and they were there.  
 
 
T hey were both very weak. Thefood situation in them ain cam p had deteriorated quiteabit.  
My m other was ver y ill, so was m y father, butthey lived.  T hey were notevacuated. They were still 

there.  
 
 
I resum ed work in the cam p, but notfor long,because if  we arrived in February, on May 
5 , 
1945, the Soviet Arm y cam e and liberated the camp.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid it m ean to you to be liberatedat thatpoint?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  I can't explain that.  If  youare in jail
 
--
 
theother day Iread a story about there was a 
guy here 20 years in
 
jail andhe was innocent all along.  How do youfeel? Are there wordsto 
describe it?  It's almost unrealthat suddenly I could say what I want,I could do what I want,so to 

speak. T hef eeling of  having survi ved this nightm aretook a while to sink in. 
  
 
You always at night had nightmares,because you didn't know what SS guy is going to hurt you 
and soforth. So it becam e apsychological adjustment to realize yo u're suddenlyf ree, and you 

weren't really f ree. The cam phad a typhoidpandem ic, and the Russians did the only smart thing, 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

25
 
they quarantined the whole thing.  Nobody could leave, nobody could go anywhere.  They all had to 
stay until that typhoid thing was going a way.  
 
 
So it was a real big adjustment.  
 
 
If ledthe cam p. If led the cam p with anothergirl. W eboth weref rom  Germany, and we 
sm uggled ourselves at a Russian troop train,which was going northeast, and we got out.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eventually, you would end up back in Berlin.  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T henm ake your wa y to theUnited States. Tell usabout that, what little tim e we 
have lef t.  
 
>> Bob Behr: T he Germ an Jews, ever since the Nazis tookover in 1933, they had two major goals 
where they wanted togo:  One was the United States, the other one was then called Palestine.  
 
 
W ell, the British who ran Palestine in thosedays, in the 1930s, they hada lot of problem swith 
the Arabs. TheArabsdidn't want the Jews to come. The British wanted the oil. So they curtailed the 
ability of German Jews  to go to Palestine.  So that lef tAmerica.  
 
 
W ell, President Roosevelt, whom  99%of  theJews adm iredevenf rom  a distance without 
knowing m uch about it, President Rooseveltfor reason of his own appointedaman whose nam e I 
hope you will rem em ber,f irst nam e was Breckenridge, the last name was Long.  Breckenridge Long 
becam ea highoff icial in the Departmentof State,and m y opinionBreckenridge Long didn't like Jews 
particularly.  ButBreckenridge Long was in charge of  the visa applications.  
 
 
As you know, anybody who com es tothe United States in those days needed a visa and 
perm ission to com e in.  You couldn't just hopa trainor hop af light.  In thosedays, it was organized.  

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

26
 
AndBreckenridgeLong did everything in his power to delay the approval for Germ an Jews to 
c om e.   
 
 
So it was the instituteof som ething, I'll give you one word, Ihope you will rem em ber it, it's 
called affidavit. W hat's anaff idavit?  Nothingm orethan a sponsor. Every Jewish, Germ an Jewish 
fam ily who wanted to go to America neededto have a sponsor.  
 
 
Now, turn the clock back and think about it. W e're talking 1934,1935,1936. America was still 
in the depression.  America had notm uch work, andpeople were very desperate.  And sooneof  the 
things BreckenridgeLong, he said, I'm not going to leta bunch of Jews come in, who are willing to 
takeany jobfor any money just to get outof Germ any.  Sohe restricted theavailability of a visa.  
 
 
Now, jum pf orward to1945, the war is over.  Germ any is gone. T he President, President 
T rum an, went to Congress and said, I wanttolet
 
--
 
I think he said50,000 Jewish people inwithout an 
aff id a vit.  
 
 
W e will let somebody else worr y about it, but they wi ll not have an affidavit.  
 
 
T o makea long story short, that'sexactly what Congress approved,and
 
th e aff id a vit, th e 
sponsorship was taken over by the Jewish com munities in the various cities.  
 
 
I arrived in New
 
York i n February of 1947,full of  eager and hopeand question mark what is 
f reedom  going to bring you in Am erica.  Didn't speak the language. Didn't have any relatives.  My 

father, asI told you, died while I was on the ship.  My big hope was gone.  So I was all alone.  
 
 
So I got to New
 
York and they putus up inthe hotel Marseilles,and thenext day, two days 
later, we were intervie wed.  A
 
lady cam e

two ladies, and said, OK, your nam eBehr?  
 
 
Yep.  
 
 
OK. W hat do you want to do?

I said,W hatdo I want to do?  I don't know anybody.  I don't have anything. What optionsdo I 
have?  
 
 
She said,W ell, letm e see. W ehave sponsors for all the Germ an Jews.  Let's see where your 
name is. She said, Oh, yeah, we got two places you can go.  You go either go to Chicagoor you can 
go to Dallas.W heredo you want to go?  
 
 
Now, ladies and gentlem en, rem em ber where I lived.  I lived in Germany, 
wh ich  wa s qu ickl y 
cut offf rom  the world.  I didn't know beansabout Chicago, nordid Iknow muchabout Dallas, but I 
hadtom ake adecision right there.  
 
 
So If igured if  I goto Chicago m y life will be entwined with gangsters.  IfI go to Dallas, I will
 
live  
with cowbo ys, by f ar the lesser evil than gangsters.  So I said,Sendm eto Dallas, and that's where I

It's our tradition at 
Fi rs t P e rs o n
 
t ha t  ou r  
F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
hasthe last word.  I'm  going to turn to Bob 
to close the program.  Because we didn't have a chancefor question and answers, when we're done 
Bob is going to step down off the stagehere.Please come down and talk to him,ask him  a question, 

say hi to him , shakehis hand, whatever youwant to do.  You'ref ine with that.  
 
 
I think it's pretty obvious that not only am ongm any other things thatBob is, it's evidentthat 
he's ahistorian and a prof essor.  So I'm sure he will be happy to share as much as you're wi lling to 

ta ke  in.  
 
 
I have oneother request f rom you. W hen Bobf inishes I'm  going toask you all to stand wh
en 
hef inishes,because our photographer Joel is going to com euphere and take aphotoof  Bob 

standing, with you in the background standing.  It just createsan incredible eff ect. If  you'll do thatfor 

us, it will be great.  
 
 
Bob?  
 
>> Bob Behr:  Last words.  I'm full of  last words, and don't you laughabout that.  
 
 
Letm etell you why I do this. I'm 92 years old. T hat is a pretty respectable age.W hy am  I

So who's going to take thetorch?  It's you.  It's you who li ves and works and sends a word out 
that if and when you see an injustice, I don'tcare if  it's gotanything to do with Jews or not,if  you see 
an injustice, don't go away and say, It's notmy problem . Yes, it is. Because,unlesspeople like you 

step in and try to the best of your ability to prevent an injustice, we'r e going to be sooneror later back 

to Naziism , because we already got som e in the United States
 
running around with swastikas.  
 
 
It's you.  I'm  asking, do what you think is right.  Don't goaway and say, It's notm y problem . It 
is your problem.  It is your problem that you take what we have experienced andm ultiply it to 

whenever there is theoppo
rtu n ity.  
 
 
T hat'sm y last word, and I hopeandI pray that you will do that. T hank you.  
 
[Applause]
