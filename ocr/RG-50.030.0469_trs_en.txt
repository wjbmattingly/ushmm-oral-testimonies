Q: Now I -- I™d like to get some  idea about your 
fa mily life, about your mother and your father 
and your brother, and what life was like. So tell 
me -- tell me  a  little bit about your father. What 
was he doing? 
A: My father, he was a baker, but h-he didn™t st
art his life to be a baker, yeah?  He was from a 
village, a mi ddle class family. Maybe I can tell yo
u a little story about my father, yes?  And that 
will lead us also to some thing in Ausc hwitz. 
Whe n I was maybe, I don™t know, a little girl 
[indecipherable] so, but I reme mber myself, a li
ttle girl ma ybe six, ma ybe eight years old. My 
father stood in front of me and he said, ﬁYou 
know, when I was born, my mother died.ﬂ During -
- giving birth. And I ask, so -- and who brought you 
up?  He said, ﬁMy grandfather took me  to his 
place. And my mother™s name  was Isen.ﬂ I was 
a little gi rl, I didn™t know
 how to react. I was 
sorry for him. And that™s it. We  never talked about 
it, and so went on like th
at, til I will come to a 

story in Auschwitz, an inte resting story, you read it. 

Q: Yes. 
A: About Vera Isen. 
Q: Vera Isen. 

A: I never knew about her, nothing. Only this gave me  the idea that she is my cousin. 

Q: But you reme mbered this -- 

A: The name -- 

Q: -- [indecipherable] Isen. 

A: -- Isen. And when we came here to Canada, in
 two cases I me t na me s -- two name s , Isen. So I 
ask, are you Isen from this city Taria from Hunga ry
?  Said no, so I went on 
with life til this girl 
came to me and she said 
that she is with -- she is looking for 
her cousin -- no, for -- yes, for her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

cousin. So who is your cousins?
 Alice [indecipherable] called 
me  Aliska -- Aliska Roth. So 
what™s your name ?  She said, ﬁI am Vera Ise
n.ﬂ And that [indecipherable] the fa mily -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- of my father. So he was brought up then, back
 in the place of his father. When he ma rried 

he took him, and he was there. And then he was 
a soldier in the first war, and he was captured by 
the Russians, right in the beginning, 
and he was in Siberia for s -- I 
think for six years in Siberia. 
And my mother gave birth to my brother before
 he went -- before he became a soldier. She 
didn™t know about him, that he™s 
alive. Some body told her ca -- my
 mother -- I saw your husband 
dead on the ground. So she got a heart condition, sh
e fainted [indecipherable] from her. And she 
believed the whole time that he died, that he is
 dead. And one day my brother was a little boy 

and he ca -- came, and he say, ﬁMommy, a Rus s
ian ma n is looking for you.ﬂ So -- and he came , 
he [indecipherable] and so they me t, and then 
I wa s born, yeah. So my brother was nine years 
older from me, yeah. 
Q: Nine years older than you. 
A: Yeah, because Siberia, the war, Si beria, and 
so -- and then my father struggled. He started 
with a store, they opened a little store, it didn™t 
work. Then he me t a ma n, a baker, so his father 
gave him some  money and they bui
lt a little bakery, because that was a family house, my grand-
grandfather™s house where they lived. And so th
ey struggled the whole [indecipherable] the 
whole life, they worked very, very hard. My
 parents were very honest and very, very 

hardworking people. My father got up in the mo
rning very early like in a bakery. Later on my 
mother, and they worked. Then when it went a li
ttle bit better, they did took some body to work 
there. Si nce -- I come from a 
poor -- quite poor family. Since my parent didn™t have money to 
send my brother to school, so th
ey let him to learn some trade.
 So he was a glasser. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

Q: A what?  
A: Glasser -- glass -- gl ass -- 

Q: Oh, glass. 

A: -- glass. And he was fra ming pictures, and he
 was a very smart, nice, hardworking boy. Then 
he became a manager in a store, like that. He wa
s also very, ve ry hardworking and very, very 
nice. Unfortunately, too nice. And 
the money which he ma de, the bi 
-- bigger part he gave to his 
-- to my mother. And then he usually worked ex
tra. Besides the store he
 frame d pictures during 
the weekends, he should earn for himself. And that
 was a little bit easier, because my brother 
ma de money, the bakery was a little -- the be
st business was when the Germans ca me. The 
Germans invaded Slovakia. That was the be
st business in the bakery, because -- 
Q: We ll let -- let™s -- let™s go back just a lit
tle bit. Tell me  what your father™s name  was. 
A: I-z-a -- [indecipherable] Roth, Izak Roth. 

Q: And your mother™s name ?  
A: Regina -- Regina [indecipherable] 
Q: And your brother? 

A: Nikolas. Nikolas. 

Q: Nikolas? 

A: It™s Nikolos -- Nikolos. It™s -- 

Q: [indecipherable] right. We re
 you close with your father? 
A: Yes, I was close with the whole family.  

Q: With the whole fa mily. 

A: Wa s a very quiet girl, very, 
very quiet. They liked me , and I appreciated them very much. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

A: Many time s in the evenings, when they slep
t already, I wa s looking at them, and I thought, oh 
my God. Some how I had a feeling, 
some thing wrong. But not like that. Only that they worked so 
hard, that my God, where will all this lead, that 
they work so hard?  I™m so very sorry for them. 
And they™re very nice, very nice. Very, very nice. 
Q: So you were a very sensitive child. 

A: Yes. And my brother, I said that unfortunate
ly he was too nice. He ma kes me  the most sad, 
because my -- when they took the parents, my parents, he was at work, and he was hidden in the 

baseme nt, there where worked. And when he heard 
that they took my parents, he ran away from 
his hidden pla -- place, came  home  t o help my pa
rents, to go with them
, and therefore he went 
with them. And there -- I me t once in a train, one of his friends who was in the same  lager that he 

-- he says they worked in a forest with my br
other, ma ny people went in, and the young me n, in 
Deblin -- in Deblin, it™s some where near to 
Lublin. I didn't say -- I didn™t see me ntion these 
lager, this concentration lager, but it must have 
been a small lager. They worked in the forest and 
they [indecipherable] they did take the older peop
le, older. My father was 53, my mother was 51. 
But that was older then. Th-They take them from
 the lager, they take them away. My brother 
wanted again to help them, so he ran away from 
the forest to help them. And so they took them -- 
took him also with my parents. That™s where they
 died, all three of them
. My mother, she worked 
in a bakery, and she worked at home. She had 
many friends in the bakery, ma ny, ma ny friends, 
people liked her. She liked to talk. A real woma
n. And so I was a quiet child, working very, very 
hard, I studied hard because I promised myself that I don™t want to be poor. I have to ma ke it. 
And therefore I st udied for a decent future. And 
like a girl, a young girl, 
I hoped that I will be 
happy sometimes. That™s approximate the same. Ma
ybe [indecipherable] w
ill -- lived in a big 
house from my great-grandfather, yes?  Apartment wa
s small, but there were tenants there. It was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
6 
 
 
an aun -- no, it was a -- an grand-aunt. Wa s my mo
ther™s brother there, my mother™s sister there 
living. My mother™s two cousins, and then some 
tenants, all [indecipherable]. They were I think 
12 relatives in the same  house all [indecipherable]. On
ly one cousin returned from some  or other, 
not from Auschwitz, I don™t remember. I never as
ked him where he was. He died in Montreal, 
we think. 
Q: What did you like 
to study, Alice?   
A: What? 

Q: When -- when you were a chil
d, what did you like to study? 
A: I wanted to be always a teacher. 

Q: Always? 

A: Yeah. Some where important  and some where wh
ere I can teach children to be good, to be 
nice. Not a knowledge -- I am not so very know
ledgeable. Not. I have only a good heart, and I 
wanted people should be nice. 
Q: And wha t  ma de you think that you had to teac
h people to do that?  Did you see a lot of cruelty 
before -- this is before Auschwitz. 
A: Not cruelty. 

Q: No. 

A: Not cruelty. But some  of mi sery. People we
re poor, people didn™t und
erstand each other. 
People didn™t try to help, they di
dn™t care about each ot
her. It™s a like -- like here. Wh o cares if 
some body™s poor, if some -- if they are not so
 poor, [indecipherable] somebody should care 
about us, but still I saw that 
it™s a big difference between pe
ople. Not too much understanding. 
It™s always a -- some how watching people, how they
 think, how they -- and so, was interested in 
people. [inaudible]

holidays to the synagogue, that™s

like that. It wasn™t nice when 
some body didn't have kosher, hm?  

Q: Right. 

A: If some body didn't go in the synagogue, what ki
nd of people are they? So we had to keep 
going, yeah. 

Q: And did you like this, or th
is was just [indecipherable] 
A: Well, it is natural, it was natural. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. When my mother went during the big 
holidays to the synagogue, 
I went to visit her. 
That™s [indecipherable] the Yom 
Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, I th
ink that was all, ma ybe. And 
she had an occasion to dress up with her big hat. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Some  -- she had some  necklace, a big one. 
So she was [indecipherable] occasion. She had 
some  people which she knew there. So she was happy to go out --

 keep in style, that was.

any way?

and three, eleven classes, yes?  And then was 
not permitted more to st udy for Jewish people, so 
since in this technical school

it™s so hard, because I wanted. And then I le

and I went from store to store to offer my 
scarves -- scarves. Nobody wanted to buy them. A

 I s howed my c ollection, 
and I said, I would like

ﬁYes, I will buy it from you, 
how ma ny you can ma ke, 
but with one condition. That we -- you will not do
 it for anybody else. O-Only for my  store.ﬂ I

the yarns. And then I -- he asked, ﬁWill you ma ke 
turbans? ﬂ At the time  turbans, they were in

twisted it and so, and I sold turbans. And there 
were in the biggest store in the window, my 
turbans and my scarves. My father came  once ho

hoslovakian, or Jewish 
Slovakian, or was that

A: Like everybody in their classroom, when we had 
to say the nationality or so, we have to get 
up, to stand up, I think that they 
asked Jewish people as a different
 nationality we had to stand, I 
think so. And we didn™t write on Saturdays. We  di

Jewish people. But was no problem. It was no --

Q: Did you know what you were scared about?
 You ha -- di -- or was it just general

exactly, he cannot be regular -- a regular owner, 
so we had to take some body to -- to write it -- 
the firm on him, yes, that he was the owner, so
me  Christian had to pay for him [indecipherable]. 
But still my father worked there. It wa s onl

Q: In the beginning. 

A: No, he had a partner, a partner who was a baker. He came. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My father build the bakery, a
nd this partner, he was the baker.
 My father wasn™t a baker, he 
learned from hi m. But this partner cheated him 
t hen, he cheated, he took from hi m money. So he 
started again from nothing. But then he knew how 
to -- how to work there, you know. He learned 
from the other one to be a baker. 

Q: But when the Gentile had to co
me  in and be the actual owner -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did the governme nt put that person in the place?

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Alice, I was a -- I wa s asking you a-about th
is woma n who was so me an about your father, 
and it™s quite a -- it™s quite an amazing 
story that -- your response to her. 
A: Yes. I did it for my father. When I finished my
 payment, I never went into her store. Never, I 
never saw her. Finished the thing for my father, I 
repaid it to my father, 
not for her, I didn™t pay 
it for her, I paid for my father. 

Q: Because you didn™t wa nt he
r to say anything mean -- 
A: No, I didn't want anybody to have some  -- so
me  bad thinking about my father. Nobody had to 
curse my father. I™m sure she wa
s happy, if even she cheated me . 
Q: Yes. 

A: And I™m quite sure that sh
e said more than she had to pay, yeah. She was happy, and she 
forgot about my father. Didn™t think about him. It
 was not her business to 
think about my father, 
or anybody™s [indecipherable]. He wa s a lovely ma n, was an angel. 
Q: And she was a terrible person, clearly. 
A: I didn™t know her before. I went some times into
 her store, and I didn™t know her after. She wa 
-- for sure she was a greedy person, not an honest 
person. But that was not my problem that time, 
how she was.  

Q: I would doubt that ma ny people woul
d have done anything like that. 
A: I know that. I know. No, when 
I came to my -- back home, so we -- I had a home, and we had 
a bakery. So I went to the bake
ry, not inside. Wa s looking into 
the bakery, and a ma n was there 
standing and lurking at the oven. I looked around 
from the outside, and I saw the equipment and 
furnitures and everything in a bakery. Some
body came to me, probably 
his wife, and h -- she 
asked, are you looking for some body?  I said no. I 
am here at home . And I turned away. I never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
18 
 
 
entered my home, I never entered a bakery, 
and I didn™t ask from hi m money to pay for 
equipment or furnitures, I couldn™t. Because it di
dn™t ma ke any difference. There was not more 
my father, and that didn™t belong more to me  
now. Not my home , and not
 the bakery. I didn™t 
want anything. I left. And I went many times into that courtyard. 
Q: Just to look. 

A: To look, and then I -- there were some  tenant s and there were some  friends, which they -- the 

fa mily, which -- a Gentile fa mily. They were livi
ng there, so when I was wa -- when the -- so I 
went to visit them, and there were two big gardens,
 one belonged to us, and to the family of -- of 
my mother, and the other one to her aunt, and th
ere were berries, gooseb
erries [indecipherable] 
and so on, this lady was so nice that she prepared 
me always, things to take home from Preıov to 
Hume nné. Said, Aliska, here, ma ke from this wine. 
I ma de even wine from ri -- this. Take this, 
and so -- so I went always there 
to see. And then they -- they got
 it -- their rent fr om the tenant s 
also, they took care of the hous
e. And how much they gave me, they gave me , yeah? 
Q: Right. 

A: So I went to the house, but I never entered 
the home . And I never entered and didn™t ask for 
the bakery. I didn™t want anything 
to have more in the garden w
ith -- which belonged to me -- to 
my mother. There were plants, nice beautiful, big pl
ants -- plants, and I wanted to -- to please my 
aunt in Humenné, yeah?  So I went to ask for plan
ts and I took them home, 
I wanted to take from 
my aunt. I took a big, big suit -- suitcase, because
 I knew that there are many plant. So the lady 
on the other side, was different from t his side, 
she came -- she came to me and she said, ﬁAliska, 
don™t take all the plants. I need 
them for my children.ﬂ And I sai
d, ﬁDon™t worry. It will be a time 
that you belong again to me .ﬂ Because she felt th
at the house belongs to hi m. And I took the 
plants and I left, but I never went 
again to -- to -- to the garden, to
 this garden til it was not on my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
19 
 
 
name . Then I couldn™t legally take it, yes. I di
dn™t want to. Not greedy, no. Nothing could be -- 
replace me  my fa mily, nothing. No
t plants, not bakery, not home , 
nothing. They were not there.  
Q: Right. 
A: No. 

Q: So now let™s go back. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Slovakia enters the wa r in 1941 when -- when -- 

A: I think so [indecipherable] 

Q: -- when the Soviet Union wa -- wa  -- when
 the Soviet Union is a -- is attacked. 
A: Attacked, yeah. 

Q: And then in m -- March of ™42, this is be
fore you become  -- you be -- you get deported to 
Auschwitz, there is a ghetto in Po
prad, is -- am I correct, or no? 
A: No. Th-The military concern, military barr acks. Soldiers --  
Q: So -- so you are still living with your parent
s when you hear about the 
fact that you have to go 
to Poprad, is that right? 
A: I didn™t know that I have to go to Poprad. 

Q: You didn™t -- you didn™t know. 
What™s the -- what happened? 
A: No, it was only a registration. My father brought
 some for mal -- some papers from the -- from 
the Jewish community, to
 register the girls. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And he had to put on the name  Sarah, in fr ont
 of Alitsa -- Alika. Sa
rah Alika was my name . 
He had to register me  and to 
take it back. And then, on March 20
th
, it was one day before they 
took me , came my brother home from work. And he 
said, tomorrow the guardist -- they were like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
20 
 
 
the fascist here, the guardist will take the girl
s. He didn™t know where, and when. Tomorrow the 
guardist was -- on Friday -- tomorrow on Saturday the guardist will come and they will take the 
girls. That wa s -- I didn™t know that the Popr
ad, or [indecipherable] Auschwitz, nothing, they 
take them. 

Q: How did your brother know?  Do you know? 

A: Somebody told him. 

Q: Somebody told him. 

A: Yeah, he just -- 

Q: So you only thought you 
were registering. 
A: I was registered, that™s all, 
and we were afraid for -- for a r
eason. Why are we there, I -- I -- I 
am registered, or are we register
ed. I don™t reme mber if also the 
family also -- I don™t reme mber, 
that I cannot say. I know only that 
I was registered, and it bothers me  always that they put me  
name  Sarah, Sarah I was here, Sarah. A typical 
Jewish name . Suddenly I™
m some body else than I 
am -- I was. 

Q: Was there any discussion in th
e house about not registering? 
A: No, no. 

Q: About just trying to escape?  Nothing. 

A: No, because we were so naïve. We talk about 
it very often, we were so naïve, and so honest, 
so -- so stupidly honest. They said 
to register, then have to regist
er. That™s the rule. Yeah, today I 
wouldn™t register for sure. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I wouldn™t go, I woul
d run [indecipherable] run. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
21 
 
 
Q: So your brother tells you that
 you™re going to be going some wher
e, but some body™s got to say 
you must leave the house. How did you know to go wherever you were going? 
A: Yeah. So, in my -- after my brother said it, 
so we realize that they
 will come , and they will 
take me, yes? 

Q: Yes. 

A: So we had supper on Friday evening, and then 
my mother took me and we went to a house, to 
a Gentile™s house, whom my moth
er trusted. She knew her from th
e bakery, a nice lady, yes. And 
she knew that she will take me  there. So we went
 there, and my mother asked her, ﬁCould you let 
Aliska to sleep here, because tomorrow the guardists are supposed to come .ﬂ She said okay, sure. 

So I slept there, yeah. But in the mo rning, my
 mother came  -- let™s see, I don™t know. Before 
noon she came  and said, ﬁYou have to come  home
 because the guardists came  and they were 
asking for you. I said you -- and I don™t know wh
ere you are. So they said when -- til noon you 
will not be on the fire st ation, then the polic
emen will look -- be looking for you, and they will 
take you there.ﬂ And that was a shame a policeman
 should take me . So I dressed up and I went 
home . My suitcase was prepared, a empty suitcase. 
So I packed my things, and I went. I went, by 
myself. 

Q: You walked by yourself to 
the -- to [indecipherable]

Q: And wha t  did you pack?  What did you put in there?

Q: We ll, that must have been really hard. 

A: Yeah, I said first good-bye to my father. We  had a mezuzah, you know? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So he said, come  here. He put his hands on 
my head, yeah, and he was crying, and then my 
mother, I said good-bye, she cried. To my brother 
I said good-bye, and I left. My mot her came to 
the -- the st reet to accompany me. She was sta
nding there, st anding where she could see me , 
because I turned always back til I could see my 
mother, she was standing there. And then when I 
was on the fire station, so I spotted my mother
 -- the fire station, she came after me , and she 
spoke to a guardist. Wa s  looking, and she was 
pointing at me, at me
. She brought my lunch,

because I didn™t have breakfast. And then we we

all of us. And then I saw my 
brother, nobody else was on the street, my brother. 
And she -- he took my suitcase, he wanted to 
help me . But then came  a guardist to him, and he
 told him to leave. My brother was crying, has 
tears. He gave me  over suitcase, was cr -- and th

a low fence. There were -- ma ny people were 
there, those who stayed, and on the other side,

Q: And your father was -- 

A: Father stayed at home. 

Q: Stayed at home . 

A: Yeah. Many people were there, 
people were talking. It wa sn™t 
too mu ch to say. No, we -- we 
didn™t feel comfortable [indecipherable]. I aske

go?ﬂ He sa id, ﬁYou go to Svit,ﬂ that was next to 
Poprad, that place. You go there. And what for 
do we go there?  Oh, there is the Bata -- Bata, yo

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So you go to this Bata company to work. 
For how long?  For two -- three month -- for two

jump through this fence and stay
 here, don™t go. I looked around, 
my suitcase, my -- all my dresses, my everythi

I will go, not so bad to go to Bata to work, yeah. It
 was a -- it will be an 
adventure to work in a 
factory [indecipherable]. 
Yeah, big adventure. 
Q: Yes. So how did you get from Pre ı ov to Poprad? 

A: On a regular train. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
24 
 
 
Q: On a regular train. 
A: On a regular train. We came there, it was la
te night when we arri
ved, I don™t know if the 
trains stopped on the train stati
on, or -- or next to the barracks.
 I don™t know, I don™t reme mber. I 
know only that it was there SS, an SS. And he had our name s, and he checked our name s, he 

called our names, if we all are there, and that 
was very scary. An SS ma
n to say -- we saw the 
Wehr macht or so in the city, when they occupied
 there, but there we saw an SS. [indecipherable] 
that hat, yes, the SS, I didn™t 
know that™s SS. They said [indecipherable] that hat. And I -- 
Q: So when did you find out it was an SS?  Later? 

A: No -- 

Q: Oh, you knew then? 

A: No, then. I -- I saw that some thing strange, so
me thing strange, so we were scared, yeah. And 
are you interested how I learned where we go?  Was 
a -- all of a little stor

our rooms, we had straw only, straw o-on the fl
oor. There we were, a empty room, they were 
sitting and sleeping. We  were there for ma ybe th
ree -- three nights. And a SS ca me , strictly in 
German, he said the rules how we 
have to behave, and he -- yeah, and also he said that we have 
to go on turns to the kitchen for -- for soup and fo
r water outside in the c
ourtyard. So -- and when 
we -- I went for water with [indecipherable] out
side. And they were -- was a soldier, a Slovak 

soldier, Slovak, not an SS at the pump, water pu
mp [indecipherable]. And he said -- til then I 
thought that everybody™s from Preı
ov, yes, I didn™t look around. Many girls. So -- and he s -- 
who is here from Preıov?  I said, 
I am. He said, ﬁStay here, I want to talk to you.ﬂ Soldier, this 
Slovak. And then he me ntioned some  name s, Jewi
sh names, boys from Preıov. I didn™t know all 
of them, but I knew the name s. And he said 
then -- suddenly he said, ﬁDo you know where you 
go? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo. Is it Ba
ta?  Is it Svit? ﬂ  He sa id, ﬁNo. You are going to Poland, and your families 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
25 
 
 
will go after you, and you will never 
return from there.ﬂ So I was shocked. He didn™t sa y 
anything. I turned away and I left. 
I didn™t say to the girls nothing because I didn™t want to create 
some  panic, and I don™t -- didn™t want for him 
ma ke some  problems, so I didn™t say anything. 
Only in the lager, when I was in Auschwitz, 
so I thought about him many times, I thought, well 
ma ybe this soldier wanted to help me , because we were some how only alone there when they 

[indecipherable] only him and me . 
And so went by time, I returned. I was working in a store. I 
was married that time. I became a manager in the 
store. I was sitting in 
the [indecipherable] and 
this Slovak soldier arrived into th
e store, a uniform, an officer. I looked at him, I said, oh that™s 
him. And I ask him, ﬁTell me, where have you 
been in March 1942? ﬂ He said, ﬁIn Poprad.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI reme mber you, and I was thinking abou
t you ma ny time s. And I thought that you were 
willing to help me . Do you reme mbe r  me ? ﬂ  He 
said, ﬁYes, I reme mber you.ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, I 

wanted to help you.ﬂ Maybe he wanted, ma ybe he
 said it after the war,
 I don™t know, but that™s 
what he said. He left, and I never me t him agai
n, he never entered the st
ore. Was interesting. 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. So now you go back and you™re with 
these, what, close to

wome n, is that right?

[indecipherable] 

A: Yes, I was only one there.

didn™t return.  

Q: Mm. 

A: No. 

Q: Had you been hearing anything about the killi

Germans attacked the Soviet 
Union, or you heard nothing?   
A: I wasn™t there that time. Wa s I ther

A: No, no, no.  
Q: No. So you had no food with you? 

A: Well, we had this -- we took some, I -- ma
ybe, I don™t remember. I remember when we came 
to -- to Auschwitz, then where we dropped our 
belongings, the -- one of 
my neighbors from our 
house, she had a -- sardines in her pockets, and sh
e shared with all. There were three, and I was 
the fourth one. So four girls, we ate one
 box of -- pack of sardines, so [inaudible] 
Q: So how long -- do you reme mber a
bout how long you were on the train? 
A: The 25
th
, went into this cattle [indecipherable], on the 26
th
 -- 
Q: You arrived. 

A: -- we arrived to Auschwitz. 26
th
, and it was early. I don™t know
 if it was noontime, maybe 
before noontime, I don™t -- don™t re -- I 
know that was light, 
and during the day. 
Q: Now, did you arrive at the ca
mp, or did you arrive in Oswieci
m the town and have to walk? 
A: We  had to walk, we had to walk. They opened the camp the -- lagers
,oh my God, and right 
away, raus, raus, out. Oh, these SS, raus, ra
us, out. And there was -- was a commandant, his 
name  was Tibbets. Had quite a good me mory. 
Today I reme mber less. 60 years, no?   
Q: Right.  

A: But I reme mber. I picture things. And he
 said, in German, ferf -- do you know German 
[indecipherable] 

Q: A little bit -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- but say it and then
 you can translate it. 

A: There is a [speaks German here]. That means,
 damn it, they are all attractive human being -- 
beings, or some thing like that. 16 til 30, everybody in boots. They -- Germans they had also 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
34 
 
 
boots, yes. Was cold, so we jumpe d out and they -- 
they -- they said, raus
, raus, out, out, it™s now 
what it means, yes. So we jumped out, and it 
was so quiet, we were so
 quiet. That was very 
scary, so ma ny soldiers, so ma ny SS. And what we s
potted was this --  I thi
nk on the train station, 
there were a few me n, I don™t 
know how ma ny, ma ybe could be 
10 - 15 me n, 20 me n, or more 
than 20, in this uniforms , this -- this off white 
and blue stripes, and alittle cap, with shovels 
working. And this is -- uniforms , they were new, 
and they didn™t look at 
us, they were working. 
Then we knew that some thing wrong, cause they 
were so dressed, and used these shovels and 
didn™t look at us, so -- so [ind
ecipherable] it was my purpose that
 we see where we are and so. 
And then we had to line up in five, and we ha
d -- we took the directi
on to -- to the entrance 
Arbeit Macht Frei.  

Q: Right. 

A: There we were. 

Q: You entered Auschwitz one. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Wa s this a half hour walk, do 
you reme mber, an hour walk, was it -- 
A: I don™t know, ma ybe  between half a-and 
one hour, I don™t reme mber. Cannot remember. 
Q: Did you happen to see any sign?  Was ther
e a sign that said lager [indecipherable] 
A: No, no, only Arbeit Macht Frei
, and a fence under electricity, 
yes, under electricity, and on 
the towers, soldiers with bayonets
 toward the lager [indecipherable
]. So, we didn™t have to know 
too much more.  

Q: You knew this was not going to be the best situation. 

A: Wa sn™t [indecipherable]. Not the Bata compa
ny for shoes, no, that be -- yes, and during the 
way -- during the trip, during the trip, when the tr
ains stopped some where,
 it was still snow, not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
35 
 
 
the 23
rd
, the 25
th
, was still snow. We  went to a forest
, and with my knowledge of geography -- 
Hugo would laugh at me , I thought ma ybe we are in 
Siberia. It™s cold, sn
ow, forest and forest 
and forest, where are we ?  So then stopped the tr
ain, and some  people were at the train station 
there. So I asked in Slovak, ﬁWhere are we? ﬂ
 And some body said, ﬁYou are in Poland,ﬂ in Polish 
language. So we knew that [indecipherable] we are in
 Poland, and I was sitting next to a girl who 
was teaching in a kindergarten, so we  started to
 talk about escaping. We will escape from here, 
from Poland. Wa s very easy to ma ke plans,
 but -- we came there, we didn™t stopped -- 
Q: You didn™t. 
A: -- she di dn™t arrive, 
she didn™t survive, no. 

Q: She didn™t -- uh-huh. You were fl
 -- you were fluent in German?  
A: Yes, we spoke at home German. 

Q: Yes -- right 

A: Now, I am less fluent. But that time , I -- it 
was my mother tongue. My first tongue. So we 
came there, to Auschwitz, into the lager, 
after the Arbeit Macht Frei, everybody was watching, 
means Arbeit Macht Frei. And the SS ladies, the 
SS wome n, they said, ﬁDrop all your belongings 
here in the corner.ﬂ So we  left everything we dropped there what we had, every -- my rucksack, 

my suitcase, everythi ng, and zaehlappell, yeah?  So 
line up into five. And one girl went to the SS 
woman and she said, ﬁThere woman took my shoe
s from my suitcase.ﬂ They were haftlings, 
inma tes, they came a day before from Ravensbrüc
k, in these stripey -- so she said, don™t worry, 
you will get it back, you know. So [i ndeci
pherabl e] dressed, so we lost -- 
Q: So whatever you were dressed in. 

A: Yeah. We lost everything. 
Still had my hat, probably.  
Q: Did you have any piece of jewelry with you, some thing that was personal? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
36 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, still kept it. 
Q: Still? Right.  

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Still. Right. Still ha-- you have [indecipherable] 

A: Wa tch [indecipherable]. Ev
erybody had some thing here.  
Q: Right. So then you line up, and what
 do they do?  They just count you? 
A: They said the rules of behavior and obedience. And they said, when you will work, you will 

get out from here, beca
use Arbeit Macht Frei. 
Q: So what were the rules? 

A: To obey. 

Q: To obey. Whatever you™re told to do. 

A: [i ndecipherable] yeah, to behave, and to work 
when I will have -- when we have to work, and 
then we will be free. And it was, you can imagin
e how quiet it was there. We lined up in five. 
We have to stretch our hands, it was always [inde
cipherable] the distance that™s between us -- 
Q: The dist -- uh-huh, right. 

A: -- you can -- they can go thr
ough the distances, and so -- 
Q: So you had to be that distance between 
you on the sides, and in front, and then -- 
A: Yeah, ma inly before. On th
e side not so [indecipherable] 
Q: Not so. 

A: Yes. And I reme mber we were standing t
oo long, it was very difficult to -- to count us. 

[inaudible] being here and [i
ndecipherable] there, the -- 
Q: Right. So you go into one part
 of Auschwitz one, there™s barracks one through 11, I think, and 
they -- there is a -- a wall around it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
37 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: In Auschwitz one, that they built b
ecause they knew the wome n wer e  comi ng.  
A: Yes, was a -- yes, a fence. It was a fence be
tween -- between the lager, was also the men lager 
-- me n™s [indecipherable] yeah, and yes electric
ity was on [indecipherable]. We  yelling, we were 
quiet. Really so 

Q: So it™s a very brutal experi
ence, I imagine, so different 
from anything that you™ve ever 
experienced or imagined in your life. 

A: Next to me  in the line, next to me  was st
anding a girl, she was before -- in -- in high school, 
she was my schoolma te, we were friends, Martha
 Cohen was her name . And she told me  when 
they dropped her things, she said, I am -- I am 
diabetic. And my in -- and I never knew that 
somebody needs injections. She says, my injectio
ns are in my suitcase. And I will not take 
injections, I will die. I didn™t 
see her next day, maybe she was somewhere further, but -- but I 
never saw her any more. But injections were th
ere, she couldn™t take [indecipherable]. Then 
when we we re standing -- but no, later on [indeci
pherable] when we™re in the barracks, then 10 
girls di sappeared, that™s the rumor, oh she -- sh
e -- she is not here. 10 
girls disappeared right 
away that first evening and we were scared wh
at happened to them, 10 gi
rls went away. So we 
were always occupied with some thing. The entertainment. In the morning we were again on 

zaehlappell, 10 girls came, passed 
by in -- in -- in military uniform
s, shaved he-heads, and -- and 
-- and covered head -- heads, and -- in
 Holland, these wooden shoes, you know these 
[indecipherable]  

Q: Yeah, clogs. 

A: -- those are some  crazy people, where are we

Maria, or who knows what. So oh, it is them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
38 
 
 
Q: It was the si -- 
A: They fixed them up in the evening or early mo
rning and then they let them go through that we 
realize where we are, a- a- and what will ha ppen to us.  

Q: So they™re wearing uniforms , these girls? 

A: Yeah, we were also wearing. 

Q: You were also wearing uniforms. So they imme diately took your clothes. Did they do that 

within the first day or two, they took your clothes? 

A: No, right away we dropped everything. 

Q: Yes. 

A: So we stayed on -- only in our clothes, a
nd in the morning they took us into the sauna. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we had to strip everyt
hing, and we -- and our jewels we
 had to put in a box. And there 
we were naked. So we possessed only our na
ked body, nothing, nothing else. Unbelievable, you 
know?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Everything. We ™re standing ther
e nakedly, nothing more left. And then there came  some  me n, 
I don™t reme mber them, and now we were shaved
 -- then we were shaved, here, here, here, 
everywhere. 

Q: Everywhere, your privates. 

A: Everywhere is shaved. 

Q: Everywhere on your body that 
wa s hair -- that had hair. 
A: We  were shaved so we didn™t have even ha
ir. So we were naked w
ithout hair, nothing, we™re 
standing there. And then we went in the [indeciph erable] in the next room, and there wes -- was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
39 
 
 
big basin. And we went into the basin and a Germ
an woma n, these kapos or so, which they came 
in yesterday from [indecipherable]. They have 
sharp brushed, ea -- each one has a sharp brush, 
like you scrape the floor. You know these brushes?  A
nd they started to scra -- to wash us, they 
started to wash us. I had a littl
e handkerchief still in my hand,
 which belonged to my neighbor, 
from my house, from our house. It was nicely 
decorated. And she -- give me  this one, she asked 
me. And I said I cannot, because not mi ne, doesn
™t belong to me . So she started to br ush me , 
brush me, til bleeding. I was tota
lly bleeding, cause I didn™t give
r her this handkerchief. I didn't 
want to give some thing what didn™t belong to me , what I save d in my ha nd when I became 
naked. 

Q: So what was on this brus
h?  This was d-disinfectant of some  kind, or soap -- 
A: The water was disin -- 

Q: The water? 

A: -- in the basin was disinfected.  
Q: So was everybody so red and bleeding as -- as you? 
A: I don™t -- I don™t think so, I think she -- 

Q: She was -- 

A: -- took her revenge that I didn™t give her 
the handkerchief. If everybody was bleeding -- no, I 
don™t think so, not so -- 

Q: Did you begin to get angr

A: Depressed and sad an
d angry and everything. 
Q: Everything. 

A: Everything, yeah, everything. But we were all in the same  basin, ma ybe we left and came, but

Q: Sa me  wa ter for everybody. 
A: Yes. So there without hair, bleeding -- 

Q: Without [indecipherable] 

A: -- not clothe. With -- you ste

 gave us a Russian military 
[indecipherable] uniforms, summer uniforms, 
summer, with under -- long underwear, Russian 
military -- a little gi rl, and a -- a -- a shirt, an unde
rshirt, and then we had to take care the pants 
wouldn™t fell down, so we had to bind them some how
 here and so and turn and turn and turn and 
fix up. Yeah, these -- these -- these uniforms
 shouldn™t fell down. It was March the 27
th
. 
[indecipherable] some  -- 

Q: Explain some thing to me , 
you say you were in a basin. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You were -- do you mean that literally? 

A: Literally, a big basin. 
Q: In a big basin, all of you were there, and 
that™s where they were
 scr -- scraping you?   
A: Yeah. 
Q: That™s where the water was?  Was there water up high? 

A: Yes.  

Q: It was, ah. 

A: But I don™t remember  if a

Q: At the same  --  

A: -- the same  ti me , yes, that I cannot say. 

Q: Right.

Q: And how did you get in? 
A: Stairs. 

Q: Stairs into the basin, I see. 

A: Into the basin, yes. 

Q: So then they give you clothes, you don™t get a tattoo yet? 

A: No. 

Q: Tattoo is later. 

A: No. 

Q: Do you get a number? 

A: No. 

Q: On this -- on the uniform, there™s nothing? 

A: Nothing, nothing. 

Q: So -- 
A: Nothing. Next day they go -- then you go into
 the barrack, yeah, a day before the -- the 
evening before when we enter the barrack, the -- or
 place, there were also
 [indecipherable] place, 
not in there. And they brought us
 all supper, the fi rst supper. We
 couldn™t eat it, because we felt 
some thing in the food, in the food. But then we l
earn that it was a sedative, bromide, or brom, 

and -- and we couldn't eat it. But it was good, it wa
s useful for us, because we stopped to have 
me nstruation for three years, we didn™t have me nstruation with these sedatives. And then we -- 

we became calm when we enter the place, the ba
rrack, then we were very nervous, was very 
yelling, and so then we released all tension 
from the last days, everybody was noisy, and -- but 
this later on. You know, they
 didn™t eat, we literally were scared
 not to eat, we throw it in the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
42 
 
 
in toilet, the food, somebody came 
and so toilet wa s blocked. And there we had in Auschwitz, 
we had the regular toilets. 
Q: In Auschwitz one. 

A: Yes, Auschwitz, we had regular toilets
, yes. We had also water there from -- 
Q: You had running water. 

A: -- there were some  horizontal pipes, and [i
ndecipherable] but we could wash and so -- so 

where are we , yes, so there we [indecipherable] fo
r -- for supper, and -- and [indecipherable] this 
one, and then, as I said, this bromide,
 brom, we fe lt is sedative in. And -- 
Q: When did you -- when did you find out? 

A: Later on they said to us --  

Q: That there was -- 

A: -- we learned, yes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- that there is some medin -- some chemical 
there. And then next day -- next day, that me ans 
one day we arrived, second day we went to the sauna
, and the third day we went to the office to 
regist er -- register . And there was the -- ther e 
were these applications, concentration camp 
Auschwitz [indecipherable] concentration lager,
 con -- concentrationes lager hausen. So we 
knew we are in a concentratione. Wh at means a 
concentrationes lager, yes?  But then was a 
question that haftling number. Haftling, so what 
kind of a haftling, where are we?  So then we 
realized we are some where -- some  prisoners. 
I mean, haftling, that means a prisoner number. 
What kind of prisoner, what did we do?  Did 
we kill some body, did we steal some thing?  What 
are we, different from others?  Where are we
, what are we?  So we had to register. 
Q: So you -- did you have to write on this registration form?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
43 
 
 
A: Yes. But I don™t reme mber, I -- we  couldn™t ha
ve numbers that time, no. Numbers we got only 
when the me n arrived, maybe in May they arrived,
 men to the lager. And there came a sloven -- 
Slovak boy. I reme mber still his name, Lally was hi
s name , Lally, he was called Lally. I think he 
was from Kashmi rok, and he spoke with -- to us
 in Slovak. And he ma de it [indecipherable]. And 
then I get a number, the number 
[indecipherable] 1287. See, I have 
a scar here. I didn™t have to 
take this blouse. You see this scar? 
Q: Yes. You took off the number. 

A: Yeah, I took off the number. Here in -- in --
 in Montreal, when I came  to Montreal. I was 
teaching, so I didn™t want. In Slovakia I made 
up story, I was joking, that™s my phone number, I 
was a very bad girl, so my parents didn™t want me  
to be lost, and so the reason I had that number, 
I was joking. But in Mont real I coul dn™t joke
, so I decided to teach writing, but first 
[indecipherable] took me  out
. I had a paper about it. 
Q: Right. 
A: From the  doctor. 1287. 
Q: 1287 was your numbe r. 

A: Right, yeah. The first transport. 

Q: Right. 

A: One of the low ones [indecipherable] 

Q: Absolutely, cause the firs
t 999 were from Ravensbrück. 
A: Yeah. I don™t know. 

Q: So [indecipherable] the fi
rst Jewish transpor t women. 
A: It was 1,000 and -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
44 
 
 
A: [indecipherable]. I me t some day in Montre
al, some body who had some  lower. She™s sick 
now, she becames -- is becomi ng blind now. So
 I don™t think that I -- it couldn™t be ma ny. 
Q: No, not ma ny [indecipherable] one of th
e lowest numbe rs of the Jewi sh wome n. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: That™s for sure. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You know that some  people say 
there was nothing put in the food. 
A: Yeah, it was -- it was.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Hundred percent, I can swear on it, brom or
 bromide. Because when -- when it was possible 
to avoid the food, and we did have
 time s when we could some  -- so me how get potatoes or -- or -- 

or some thing like that, so you [indecipherable] pr
epare to avoid food of 
this sedative bromide 
[indecipherable]. That™s it. 
Q: Right. So yo-you think it was a couple of mont
hs, it was some ti me  in May when you got the 
tattoo? 
A: Yeah, I think so. 

Q: Do you reme mber what -- what he used to do the tattoo, wa s there a -- 

A: Some  needle. 

Q: Some  needles. 

A: Put in some colors in the -- 

Q: Did it work the fi rst time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: It did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
45 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: It stayed? 

A: Some  of them, they had to repeat, but some  other -- 

Q: Some  of them, but with you it was okay. 

A: I really [indecipherable] 

Q: What was that like for you to have a 
tattoo?  What a stra
nge [indecipherable] 
A: I had a tattoo, that™s it. 

Q: That™s it. 

A: I took things how they came. Could I avoi
d it? No. So wha t  should I bother with it? 
[inaudible]  

Q: So you had a certain kind of 
calm about you in a -- in a way? 
A: Yes. 

Q: That this was what the world was, a
nd this is how you were going to do that. 
A: Yeah, yeah. To try to survive day by day and 
not to think of the -- 
after tomorrow, because 
who knows if the after tomorrow will be [indeciph
erable] survive today, not
 to think about that. 
To hope -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- to st rive , to believe with nobody -- and I wi
ll survive. But basically nobody will survive, 
nobody, because at the last time , at the last  day, 
they will -- they will throw bombs or something. 
The last da y they will kill us all. So if alls
 I hoped, I believed, but logically, nobody will survive. 
Q: Okay, let™s -- 

A: Scary. 

Q: Very scary.

A: I will tell you what is mi rror, also a good story. 
Q: Yeah? 

A: That is such a [indecipherable] story. After a 
few days when I was in this uniform, I went up

they -- some thing was there. And I saw some body
 to walk up the stairs in the window, and I

somebody sl eep there whom I knew from home, I  
knew him. But some body else, I didn™t bother 

about his name , or her name , no. Everybody was

Q: Nothing. 

A: -- didn™t mean anything, that

Q: Right, right. 
A: Later on I made friends there. I had a very, ve
ry close friend who became like a sist er to me. I 
still didn™t forget her. I never had 
a sister and she was like my sister. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: Dieter Rishter, from Bratislava. 
Was a story -- I have so ma ny stories. 
Q: That™s great. 

A: When I was home, at home, my uncle the teache
r, he was not much older than me  because he 
was from the second husband of my grandmother, y
eah. He wasn™t much older. Even I liked him 
like [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once 
in his room, and I saw 
there a letter lying on 
the table, I was looking at it. A
nd there was a little pict
ure, little picture 
of a girl, and it was 
signed like, eira Dieter, 
eira Dieter, yeah. I didn™t ask anybod
y. I always had the nature not to 
ask, I don™t ask people anything. Wh en they
 s -- you say something to me , you say 
[indecipherable]. So I was -- and I reme mbered this
 name  Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from 
Bratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit.
 That™s it. And went to [indecipherable] in the 

lager, and there -- you see, when people canno
t fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the 
Canadians, with Mexicans and so
 they turn against groups, yeah. 
So was in lager also. The first 
day, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be 
ashame d, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from 
west Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my  directi
on is always [indecipherabl
e] -- east Sl ovakia, 
Bratislava wa s from west Slovakia. So -- and 
once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw -- 
right away, yes, was ma ybe in -- in -- no, I don™t ri
 -- in winter after we came  there. We were 

standing the whole Sunday outside, 
was cold, very cold. We  are standing there. And that time  I 
think we didn™t have more these uniforms, we 
were some how i n civil dresses, and we had the 

line. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls 
and they played around and talked and so, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
50 
 
 
they were from the other part of Slovakia, and th
ey asked me where I am from. I said from this 
part of slo -- said, oh, you are the same  lik
e we are. You are -- you don™t belong there 
[indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger gr
oup. So and there was a girl and they played 
around with her joking, and said -- oh, some body sai
d, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her, 
ﬁAre you Dieter Rishter?ﬂ She said, ﬁYes, I am Di
eter Rishter.ﬂ So -- be
cause he told me  her 
name  is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is
 whoever. She said, oh, I reme mber him ve ry well. 
And then I st ayed with them, and she said, come
 with me, come with me, we will be together. 
Because we could move our bunks, ye s, and in th
is barrack where we were, there were beds, 
everybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipher
able]. But two -- two girls slept together 
because these beds were -- come, come with me
, we will be together. She has a -- she had the 
older sister there. So then I stayed with her,
 and we became very, very good friends. We worked 
together, we were in the same  commando and we
 were together. But she became sick. And when 
we had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so sh
e had swollen legs. We  were sitting in the 
sauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was ma ssaging her legs, 

she was very, very sick. I took care of her. And 
then in the -- the whole 
night we were sitting 
there in the sauna, and during the mo rning we ha
d to line up, and it was a 
selection, and that was 
the biggest, biggest selection, becau
se always when the lager was fu
ll, it wasn™t place where to 
sleep, then they ma de the selection. Between that 
time we went back to the other barrack, we had 
-- we slept on these bunks and so 
-- and so it was a big selection, 
very big, first they took one, 
then five left, and so on and so on and so. So I 
asked myself someday, how come that they never 
selected me , that they never point ed on me . So 
I came to the conclusion, maybe it™s true, because 
I never looked at them. [indeciph
erable] like this. I was straight, 
and I never looked up there. I 
says, and maybe they pointed and I didn™t 
see. But I think [i
ndecipherable] ma ybe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
51 
 
 
[indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put 
Dieter in front of me , Dieter
 do -- she spoke German, you go 
in front of me, and I will follow you on the selecti
on, because I was so sure that I will ma ke it, 
that time. So she pointed like th
at, and she went, and I was pray
ing, oh my God, help me , Dieter 
should pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she we nt
, she passed. They didn™t take her to the gas 
chamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks G
od. Dieter we nt through sick. And then we had 
to line up again and then 
they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, 
so, so, so -- so I lost her, no. She went some whe r e else. And the next day in the morning, I don™t 
reme mber if we didn™t go to work or so, or ma
ybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the 
other one to call her name . Dieter
 Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No 
answer. So I went to the next 
barrack, and to next barrack. And some body sai
d, ﬁDieter Rishter died.ﬂ She survived the 
selection, but she died, sick and exhausted. 
So what happened?  She went down from the 
[indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable]
 she had to go down. She went down, she fell 
down. And s he wasn™t [indecipherable] they took
 her to the -- through to -- to the other 
[indecipherable] and I lost Dieter
. I cannot still forget her, such
 a nice girl. So -- and before -- 
excuse me  -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know. 

Q: So you were together for a -- a year -- 

A: A few months -- 

Q: A few months. 

A: -- or maybe longer, I don™t know, maybe longer
. We made  even business together, because 
she was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas 

chamber when the people arrived. They had to dr op there the things, they didn't arrive to the 

lager to leave them. And then they
 carried the things to our comp
any and we had to -- to -- to 
fold them, t o bundle them, and they send it, 
probably to Germany. 
And people had some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
52 
 
 
jewelries, diamonds, and -- in their 
clothing, yeah. So it was there a pile of this clothing and they 
have to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I 
was folding, yeah. So she said once, when I will 
call summer kleider, summer dresses, so you co
me, that means that I found some thing, some  
jewelry, some thing. So once she found ducats -- du
cats, golden ducats, golden [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So I took it a few ounce, I think eight or so. And there was a ma n, because he worked in a -- 

in a -- in a -- in the compound where me n we
re, so there was a block -- she was hannah 

blockalteste, he was a blockalteste, Polish ma n. I us
ed to see him to come  in -- into work place, 
so -- and I noticed that he takes some thing from 
girls and then he brings something. So I stopped 
him, I said I have ducats, I have golden ducats, I 
gave him. So for these eight big golden ducats, 
he gives ma ybe four little breads,
 and -- a-and a ma rgarine, I think a [indecipherable] for this 
one, so we had for two, three days.

A: All -- also, also.  

Q: Yes. 

A: These picks, and -- 

Q: So let™s go back, wh-when you got the job in 
the laundry, who assigned people to the job?  Do 

you have any reco -- recollection? 

A: By accide nt probabl y, but I asked a girl, sh
e was in this bl ock 10, her name was Bluma. I 

think she was from Bratislava, I am not sure. Sh
e passed away [indecipherable] from Tsipi. She 
worked as a assistant to the kapo, I don™t know 
how she got this job, in
 the laundry, and I asked 
her to take me  to the laundry. I thought the lau
ndry cannot be so bad. So
 she took me for night 
shift. So I worked there as a -- 
during night shift, but it wasn™t 
good for -- I wasn™t a strong girl. I 
was a weak girl, and I had to rest, and I coul
dn™t relax during the day, 
during -- during night I 
worked. So I came to -- during the day to the b-
block. So it wa s noisy, always on mo -- I couldn™t 
sleep. So I was very tired. But I went on and on 
and on, we had to -- to wash and so, and that 
happened an accident  to me . You know these disi n 
-- di sinfection water was in a -- in a bucket, 

and when we worked there one day the kapo said th
at we have to come  to the other room where 
they [indecipherable] because a 
transport was comi ng. So we  ma
de order clean the basin, and 
everythi ng there. And there was a bucket with -- 
with disinfection water, and she pointed on me  
and she said, this water, this water, that she sa
id, she didn™t say what, in German, this water. To 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
55 
 
 
me  it seeme d to be a dirty water, so I poured it into canal. So she came to me  and she slapped me  
and slapped me, so that I couldn't feel my -- 
my face, was numb totally. And then she -- she 
slapped me so far, that I -- I di  -- I was standi
ng there, I didn™t feel anything more, slap, slap, 
slap. But next day when I went back, I thought, wh
at can I do?  She™ll be angry at me . I will go 
and I will apologize. And I went 
to apologize. I said, it didn™t hur
t me  that you beat me so much, 
but it hurt me that I made something wrong, that
 I ma de you angry. And as an award, she gave 
me a half a lemon. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, and I said, oh, lemon. And then I stayed for a few weeks, to work there. 

[indecipherable] to go to sonder -- to Ause
nkommando. And during that time -- during the day I 
was free, so before I went to sleep, I went to
 the naishtuber, and I asked there in the sewing 
room, could I work here? I know how to sew. Said yes, you can work here. So I worked til Ma y 

there, til the wome n exchanged. And then, when 
the wome n exchanged us in May, and we went 
in August to Birkenau, to Auschwitz two, so
 I went to Ausenkomma ndo. Then I went to 
Ausenkommando, in May, and I lost the naishtuber
. It was a good job to sew on the machine and 
so -- 

Q: And you were inside when you did that. 

A: Wa s inside.

s, and underwears is white ones and rough ones, 
so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

Q: Right. 
A: -- probably something like these uniforms, 
these man uniforms, I think so. I think so. 
Q: Now, we re you able to wash yourself, because there was one -- running water in the barrack 

at Auschwitz one? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you had a certain kind of hygiene that you could -- 

A: There -- til August, til August, yes.

were alone, and all [indecipherabl

reme mber with whom I worked, Tsipi. [indeci

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
59 
 
 
A: Before Birkenau, ye s -- no. Before birke --

demolition diffi cult for you? 

A: Yes, very difficult. Once happen that with this 
pick, with this steel equipment, I hit my finger 
and it was bleeding and I had some  s car -- not sc
ar, some  -- some  -- scar? Yeah [indecipherable]  
Q: A scarf? 

A: A -- a scarf, yes, on my head. So -- and I took the scarf into my teet
h, and I tore a -- a piece, 
and I turned around my finger, and the kapo came 
and she said, poor child, poor child, because I 
had around this, I was bleeding, yes. It
 was very difficult for me , but -- 
Q: This was the -- 

A: -- I managed. 

Q: -- the -- the instrume nt that you used was likea long log with -- with 
iron-like -- something to 
hold onto on the sides, right? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
60 
 
 
Q: And so that you were what, like eight wome n, or 10 wome n --  
A: Oh, that -- that what you -- what
 you say, but this was by myself, we -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- we had to -- a -- a baseme nt, let™s say, to 
-- to take apart, which was demolished, yes? 

Q: I see, it was already, I see. 

A: Yeah, with dynamite or so, and we had to take
 apart totally, and that 
-- that was a wall, then 
we haul this little stick -- not 
a little -- big steel stick, ma ny of
 us, and boom, boom, and then the 
wall fell down. And then we ha
d to separate the bricks. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then to pour on [indecipherable] yeah. 

Q: And so you did that for what, a couple of mo nths? 

A: No, I did it for ma ybe a couple of weeks. See, I 
always took risks. It wa sn™t so difficult to go 
from one place to the other to work -- to line up in the morning -- 
Q: It wasn™t -- 
A: -- when it was place, yes. It was possibl
e, it wa s possible to move around. So probably f -- 
ma y- ma ybe for two months I could have done it, 
two -- mostly three months this one. Then I 
went to work on a -- where we were digging so
il and preparing a place for roads, for road, 
digging soil. Then we took the soil from one place 
to the other one, and so prepare for roads with 
the this one. Sometimes I went 
like the time with Tsipi on a fiel
d, too. Some ti mes we went -- in 
the wintertime I re me mber we went -- we took over
 some straw from one  place to the other one, 
some  useless things. And for months, for a few m
onths, I was working weeding out the field for -
- for gummy plant [indecipherable]

Q: For rubber? 
A: Rubber. 

Q: Rubber. 

A: Rubber from [indecipherable] that wat -- was ve

Then some times went some thing else to work. 
We had different places. But these demolishings 
could have been two, three months, yeah, two, three months in ™42.  

Q: Did that ma ke -- did that help your body, di
d you get stronger, or di

gloves or we didn™t have sa -- stockings. So 
some ti me s I had stockings for gloves -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- on -- it was very cold on the chest, sowe were happy with impossible things. We -- we 

were happy when we found old ne
wspaper and we put it here on the breast, or we we re happy 
straw -- to find some  from the straws, that we took
 out straw, and we put it
 here inside to ma ke 
us warmer.

Q: Did you have trouble with your feet becaus

A: I had troubles. I think that was during th

Q: Oh, that™s late.  

A: Yeah, the late. 

Q: But not -- not early? 

A: Not that early. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I had sore soles because it wa

Himmler, in connections about 
Hi mmler. I came so far to Himmler, to Mengele. Oh yeah. 

Q: Yes, so we -- we™ll st

A: As I will tell you later.  
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
63 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: We were talking about the shoes. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And -- and the problem you mi ght
 have had with your -- with 
your feet, and it was leading to 
another story, yes? 

A: Right [indecipherable] 

Q: Yes, so tell me . 

A: Tell you? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay. So, it was at the beginning, I was sti
ll in Auschwitz one, in Auschwitz one, and I had 
good shoes with laces, high shoes, good shoes,
 but it was I think in
 the spring, because I 
reme mber that the sole was wet some times, and --
 and cold still. So I don™t know which month it 
could have been, yes. Maybe between -- betw
een the naishtuber, laundry, ma ybe between the 
laundry, because from laundry I went to the nais
htuber between -- before. So we had to wear 
impossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders. Y
ou tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and 
barefoot in to walk to a forest where there were
 little stones like gravel
, yeah?  And we have to 
walk, so -- and [indecipherable] little
 gravels, they were cold, and th
ey were wet. And first of all 
my -- my soles, they became  hard and -- and 
painful, yes, you me nti
on, like that. Later on the 
soles, they became hard, trained well, no problem
. But my eyes, probably fr om an infa -- an 
inflamma tion from these cold stones. So on my 
e yelashes, they were some  kind of glue. You 
know, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn™t 
open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the 
eyelashes, got dry glue. So I had to take off littl
e by little, little 
by little. And then next night 
again happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a 
few -- for a time  with this -- my eyes, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
64 
 
 
and one mor ning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to 
walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes, 
and then we had to take off the shoes, and to come
 back again barefooten, ag
ain this --  to this -- 
through this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel 
chilly when I think about it. So one day I was 
standing on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stan
d in the -- I don™t know w
hy, in the front, first 
one. And suddenly was quie -- very 
quiet, very quiet, and I heard this name  Hi mmler. I knew 
who was him, who was Hi mmler. I looked aroun
d, not frar -- far from me  was standing 
Hi mmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses. Oh my
 God, I was so scared that Hi mmler will look at 
me, and he™ll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought th
is [indecipherable] I h
eard the Gypsies, they 
used to have [indecipherable] too. I was so scar
ed he would send me  for death. I didn't know that 
time gas chambers was in Auschwitz. So I moved 
slowly, slowly in the 
back, he shouldn™t see 
me, I should save myself from Hi mmle
r. He was standing there looking. 

Q: So you did take risks, didn™t you?  

A: I took -- 
Q: Cause it was risky for you to mo ve. 
A: I took always risks. I took al
ways risks. And I couldn't when
 I saw the situation is bad, I 
cannot lose anything, then I took risks. But I can
not lose anything, only my life, and this was a 
risk by itself. Yeah, so I -- 

Q: Where did that come from? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know.  

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t know. But I had to 
do. What can I lose?  Nothing.

Q: So in Auschwitz one, there was a gas chamber, yes? 

A: Yes, but we didn™t know about it. 

Q: You didn™t know. 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t smell anything funny? 

A: No, nothing. 

Q: Nothing. And nobody™s said anything to you? 
A: But we knew when we were standing in the 
evening on zaehlappell, so
 far away, like in a 
forest, there were moving people, bodies moving, 
some how it was far, so it seemed to me , or it 
m- meant to me  that they are in white uniforms, t hey are moving around, and flame, we saw 
flame there. And there was a rumor always, we talked about lager. 

Q: Right. 

A: Said there is the place where they burn peopl
e. It was flame, and people were moving there. 
But later on I lear ned that  they burn
ed outside the crematoriums , people. 
Q: Uh-huh, right [indecipherable] 

A: But I didn™t see close to me .

Q: Did you hear about shooting in -- in Auschwit
z one, that there was a punishme nt block, that 
they were shooting, did you -- did you hear
 about that when you were there?  No. 
A: Not about that, but
 I -- I heard it. 
Q: You hear -- you heard it. 

A: Yes, very silently, very, ve
ry silently. I was in block 10 -- 
block 10, that was a last -- well, 
you said it, in Auschwitz were 11 blocks. 

Q: I think. In Auschwitz one. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: You are right. 

Q: And you were in 10. 

A: I was in 10. 

Q: Uh-huh.  
A: And on the 10, on block 10 on the -- and I wa
s sleeping next to the window at the end. 
[indecipherable] block, block, bl
ock, the end, and I was sleeping 
at the window at the end. And 
there were boards on the windows, boards, but th
ere were little distances between the boards, 
yes, wooden boards. Little, little distances, and 
used to look during the day when I came  -- it was 
light, yeah, but at the beginning 
I even didn™t go for a few da ys 
to work because I was washing 
the stairs and the -- and -- and th
e -- the floors and whatever. It
 ma de me  sickening, that was 
depressing. So anyhow, during the day when we 
came early probably, I don™t know what time , I 
cannot say that, but I know that was light
 then, until August was lighter in the day 
[indecipherable] the little dist
ances, I saw these high, high poles, 
steel from st -- I think from 
steel, wood, or steel, I don™t know. They were hi
gh poles, that™s for sure, a pole like this, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
67 
 
 
then crosswise on the top, and there I saw a 
ma n, young me n -- they were high, again I say high, 
higher than a ma n. They were hangi
ng like that, the hands in the back
 like this, like this, and here 
betwe -- they were hanging on the po
les so that their feet di dn™t 
reach the floor -- the earth -- the 
floor, yes?  The earth -- 
the concrete or what. 
Q: So they -- they were being 
hung by their hands be
hind their back? 
A: Yeah, they were hanged there. So I saw this 
one, always a fe w, few, few. And then during the 
night, sometimes -- sometimes, not always, some tim
es I -- but I was always scared to look th-
there, I knew I don™t have to see 
that, was a silent shooting, very
 silently, cause I was at the 
window. And I didn't look out so I wouldn™t see,
 because it was darkness probably, I don™t -- no, 
I didn™t look. But I heard silent shooting. So I 
thought, oh, now they are killing, and now after 
the war, I wa s in Auschwitz, and I asked so
me body there [indecipherable] when I left 
[indecipherable] I me t her in Birkenau. I said, 
I didn™t see these poles 
where the people were 
hanging. But then later some how on -- 
before I -- before I ask, because then bef -- then I went 
through these barracks, becau -- and I saw in one
 place these pole. And my son, I said, you see, 
these are these poles where people were hanging. 
And she said it was a quiet [indecipherable] I 
says, and every night I heard a ve
ry, very silent shooting. She said
 yes, during the night was this 
silent shooting. And there is now a wall, a-and fl
owers and Slovak people put 
flowers. I think it™s 
black. And even the wooden walls
, I think they are black now. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, because she asked me , wa
s it painted?  I said no. From th
is side was not, I didn™t see it 
from the other side. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
68 
 
 
Q: Yeah, Alice, when you say silent shooting, 
what -- what do you mean? You mean that there 
was -- there was a silencer on the gun that -- orthat you were so far away you could only hear it 
a little bit? 

A: I wasn™t far. 

Q: You weren™t far. 

A: I™m far because I was -- I sl ept at
 the win -- next to the window.  
Q: Uh-huh. Which was close to that wall. 

A: It™s the closest to the wall. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: So ma ybe was silent gun, I 
don™t understand [i ndecipherable] 
Q: Yeah, but what were you 
hearing, a pop?  Just a -- 
A: Yeah, some thing like that, yes,
 not like boom, boom, in the war. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: In combat in the fi eld. Not like that . Silently.  
Q: You -- you didn't help at all in building Birkenau. Some  of the prisoners were doing that. 

Were you ever over there? 

A: In building? 

Q: Mm. 

A: No -- yes, the roads. 

Q: Roads. 

A: We were building the roads and we were
 demo lishing the houses, which they were 
demolished partially before. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
69 
 
 
A: We came like to a village, yes, like th
e village, and that we, for three months were 
demolishing. 
Q: And that became Auschwitz-Birke nau?  

A: I think -- 

Q: You think so, but you you™re -- but you™re not sure. 

A: I think it. I am not sure. I know 
we demolished it there, that place -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and I know we wor ked on the roads that we -- we ma de it straight, how to say, plan-planate 

-- planarat e -- in -- i
n, I would say --  
Q: Planing? 

A: Planing, ma ybe in Ge rman, I would say planating -- 

Q: Making it smooth? 

A: We made  it smooth and straight, yes, so we ha
d to dig it, and shovels 
to dig out and to -- and 
to put it in this wooden 
container -- container -- 
Q: A wheelbarrow? 

A: Yeah, some thing and take it to another pl ace, and so on and so -- ma ny useful thing -- useless 

things we had to -- from one pl
ace to the other one. So we did 
some thing, yes. And it was at the 
beginning where we worked at the roads, we [ind
ecipherable] the roads, there was also a civilian 
who was leading this probably 
[indecipherable] and the kapos, a
nd SS me n, and we worked. And 
then they were looking, so we were working 
when they were not looking and not working, and 
[indecipherable] see in -- in -- in Ge
rman number -- number eight is acht. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
70 
 
 
A: Acht -- acht, and -- and be careful is ac
htung, no -- achtung, so the SS came close, when he 
turned, so we  said that in Slovak is acht -- is 
acht -- achtung, so we said awesome is -- is -- 
awesome is acht. [indecipherable]. Then we work
ed hard. We couldn™t work always like that 
[indecipherable] it easy. 

Q: [indecipherable]. Right. 

A: We  cannot be always a honest worker. 

Q: No, not in a situation where they treated you so bad. 

A: No [indecipherable] 

Q: No.  

A: No, so if I -- if I helped to 
-- to build, so I hel -- helped to 
destroy a place, and I helped to 
build the roads, yes. 

Q: We re there lights in Auschwitz one?  Wa
s it --  were there actual light s there?  
A: I think that ther e were in the barracks. 
Q: In -- in the barracks? 
A: Yeah, I think so, but ar
ound the fe nces there were. 
Q: There were. 

A: There were high lights during --
 with this high voltage electr
icity during the night. When we 
arrived, the day when we arrived, and then al
ways during nights, and the guards they were 
standing on towers and guarding us, the 
soldiers, yeah, was a [indecipherable] 
Q: So when did you find out that you were all 
-- all the wome n were be
ing -- I know me  -- me n 
were going into aush -- into Auschwitz
-Birkenau, they were already there. 

A: The me n ?   

Q: [indecipherable] and being -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
71 
 
 
A: Of the men I didn™t know. I knew that the wo
me n went there because when we came there, 
they were -- was some life there. 
Q: They were there, yes. 

A: About the men, I -- I don™t know. 

Q: So how -- you don™t know. 

A: I didn™t bother. 

Q: So did they announce to you what -- get up we
™re going to ow -- Auschwitz-Birkenau?  I me an 
ho-how -- how did that happen? 

A: I don™t know. Probably it could ha ppen that we 
were on a zaehlappell on a roll call, and they 
said now turn and we go. 

Q: And you go. 

A: There™s nothing to ta
ke. Moving was very easy. 
Q: Nothing to -- nothing to pack, easy, right. 
A: I cannot reme mber, I think and think if this container in which we ate, you know the bowl. 
Q: The bowl. 

A: If we took it with us or we 
-- or we left it in the -- in the 
barrack and -- and then we got it 
when -- received it when we ar -- I cannot 
-- I don™t remember , th
is I don™t reme mber. 
Q: Did you carry the bowl with you all the time? 

A: No, that what I don™t reme mber. I know that
 we had some little sack hanging, and I don™t 

reme mber where we took the ma terial to sew it 
and a needle. I don™t reme
mber. I can see myself 
only suddenly hanging here some thing. 

Q: Something.  

A: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
72 
 
 
Q: And wha t  was in it? 
A: And a little -- a little bit of bread
 which we saved from the evening. 
Q: I see. 

A: And ma ybe a -- a first knife or s -- when
 some body found some where on 
the field a little -- a 
little steel or some thing, and we sharped it on 
-- on -- on a stone, an-and we cut our bread. So 
ma ybe these -- ma ybe we found somewhere a -- I don™t know how we got a spoon, I don™t know, 

I don™t know.  

Q: You weren™t given a s
poon, you were given the bowl. 
A: The bowl, but I don™t reme mber we carried the 
-- with us when we went to work far, where 
we were serve. I don™t think -- I cannot see th
e -- the move around, I know we have only this 
little sack, and a little bread, a
nd if we had a little plate, 
this is to cut our bread and 
[indecipherable] I don™t reme mber th
at, this I don™t. I know only a little bread, and on the way to 
work, always a bite. It wa s easy, because we didn
™t have to think too mu ch, we -- our thinking 
went so far as into the [indecipherable] I have 
still a slice of bread, I 
get still a little bit.  
Q: So -- so your mental state become s smaller and smaller? 

A: Smaller and smaller. 

Q: So that you think about very few things. 

A: Yes. The emotions, they tend to apathy, tota
l apathy. You think, I do this, I will think about 
food, I will think about when they will -- no, only
 when we arrive -- when we arrive  back 

afterward, we think if we have a bl
anket to cover ourselves. Little thi
ngs, we -- if it is cold, if it is 
-- 

Q: If you picture the barrack and your bed in
 Auschwitz one, do you see the bowl there?  Do you 
think that you left the bowl on the bed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
73 
 
 
A: Not on the bed, ma ybe there was a little room
, concrete floor, ma ybe -- ma y -- there were 
servants stumalteste, stumdienst, ma ybe. Maybe they
 got there, th-that they put it there, and they 
washed it there, but it wasn™t di rty because if 
you didn™t wash it -- in Birkenau, we didn™t have 
water. So couldn™t be so dirty 
that [indecipherable] after food. So
 probably they carried from -- 
probably. I don™t know -- know, I speculate on it. Pr
obably they got from the sauna, water, the 
sauna in a bucket or so, and they washed it there 
and they left it and then
 we took it from there. A 
little room a t  the end of the barrack -- of 
the block. I -- I don™t reme mber how it was. 
Q: So do you reme mber entering Birkenau in August of ™43, do you reme mber -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- that first day? 

A: Yes, yes, I reme mber. 

Q: What -- what can you tellme about it? What  was it like? 

A: We  entered and -- and difference was that 
they were brick barracks, brick blocks in 
Auschwitz, also brick blocks, but they were lo
wer -- lower brick blocks. And in Auschwitz we 
had beds, bed, everybody has a bed, or we didn™t ha
ve -- and there were these bunks, in Birkenau 

were bunks, one, two, three. 

Q: And it™s three, three high, right? 

A: Three, yes. 

Q: And mor e  than two people are sleeping on each bunk? 

A: Oh my God. Yes, depends how
 many people were in the bloc
k. There were also some times 
five people, and -- and so I fell once down during 
the night when I had to go on it, so we were 
four like that, and above us like th
at, crosswise. And I was afraid to
 s -- that I will 
sit on -- on this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
74 
 
 
person who is crosswise, so I went
 to the end, very end. So I -- I went to the end. So I fell on my 
back on the concrete, and was a big boom. In 
the morning I went to work, and back pain. 
Q: In a lot of pain? 

A: Oh, ho, how. I still reme mber. I was young.  

Q: But it™s interesting, because as bad as Au
schwitz one was, Birkenau was much worse. 
A: Much worse. 

Q: Yes. 

A: In b -- in Auschwitz, we di
dn™t know about the gas chambers. We  didn™t know. We  worked, 
was very, very hard to work. We  didn™t know ab
out the gas chambers. When we came from work 
we ran around into the -- into this wa shroom or 
whatever, there were hori
zontal pipes, went to 
clean up, and ma ybe we washed something. Ther
e were toilets, there 
were toilets, I -- I 
reme mber, so maybe I am wrong, but in my me mories
 that there were -- ye
s, surely there were 
toilets, because there were toilet rumors. We went in the toilet and we heard rumor that the -- the 
wagons are from Slovakia here, they came to pick
 up us, and so on, so -- there were toil -- there 
were toilets, there is wasser -- water [indeciphe
rable] more. We were not gas -- there were gas 
chambers, which I saw after when I went, after the 
war, two or three ga -- not gas chambers but 
crematorium. Were no gas chambers, at leas
t we didn™t know about the gas chambers. We 
worked very hard. The sa
me food, but it was easier. 
Q: It was easier than in Birkenau. 

A: Yeah, yeah, it was easier. 

Q: So Birkenau become s a shock. There is no running water, right? 

A: No run -- only in the sauna. In the sauna th
ey used for us and we went for delousing, get 
delousing. And that time [indecipherable] the delo
using we went to a -- 
to a real sauna where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
75 
 
 
they used hot bricks, hot bricks 
and they pour water on it, so it 
was a steam, so we we nt in the 
steam. And there were showers in the sauna, in th
e same  building, yes. It was -- but outside was -
- it was not -- it wasn™t a toilet, was a 
latrine, yeah. And we had to go far up. 
Q: Right. It™s a -- a room with ju
st lots of holes in it, right? 
A: Not holes. 
Q: Holes?  

A: The hole was open. 

Q: Ah, period, completely open. 

A: Open, and there was like a be
nch, and we had to -- we went on the bench, and -- and we lean 
to there, and -- and we hold it on. It was also -- 
they had also -- it was on 
one side up the hill, and 
down there were toilets, but a 
German haftlings, for the German prisoners. The Germans. They 
had -- had toilet, but not a toilet
 like that. Was something also lik
e a latrine, something like that, 
that was a clean one and so for the Germans. Th
ey didn™t let us at the 
beginning, only at the end 
then, the -- they said the Sl
ovaks [indecipherable] Slovaks. 

Q: The Slovak? 

A: Yeah, the Slovaks there had [indecipherable]
 Slovaks ma ke a [indecipherable] and in our 
barrack where we were, and I was [indecipherable]

know her name ?  

Q: Tsipi?  He len Teshauer 

A: Yeah, yeah, her, her.

A: Saw the crematories -- the crematoriums. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: In these -- in block seven in Birkenau, I wa

Q: Register. 

A: Yeah, before all [indecipherable] I don™t remember. 

Q: Uh-huh.

Q: We ll, they kept people there -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then they took them to

A: From the r e, yes. 

Q: So -- 

A: Some times. 

Q: So -- and some ti me s not. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
78 
 
 
A: Some times not and it was -- wh
en it was selection, 
they took them right away to the gas 
chamber. 
Q: Right. 

A: Only when they -- when they took here
 and there some body and th
ey didn™t have enough so 
they kept them there. 

Q: But they started to have -- there we re some  
selections in Auschwitz one, yes?  So -- or you 

don™t know? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: But in Birkenau you started to have selections? 

A: Yeah. In Auschwitz one -- 

Q: One, yeah. 

A: The -- no -- yeah, it wa s Auschwitz one, we saw during that zaehlappell, some ti me s a black 

closed car, a -- a truck or so, a closed one a 
black one. So we used to say they take some body. 
And like these my friend, these -- who had insulin in 
-- in this one, the purse,
 in -- in the suitcase, 
I didn™t see her more, that means they were taken. 
And also up the stairs was a little like a loft, a 
little room, and some  family was looking out 
through the window, they didn™t go to zaehlappell 
and they loo -- used to smile at us, you know, they 
were so happy that they 
are there. They didn™t 
go to -- but they disappeared also. So they -- prob
ably with these black car, they took people out. 
An-And we used to hear or say that they™re in th
e forest with this white uniform, was where that  
flame, we say that they ta
ke there, the people to burn.

I was so tired, an-and hungry, and everything, and 
when I will go on like this, next se
lection I am going, they will take me, I cannot take it more. So 
I took a risk and I stayed in th
e barrack, in the block, I didn™t go 
to work. And I knew that I take 
a risk because when -- some times, once in awh
ile the SS, some body from the SS came  through, 
they went through the barrack, the blocks. A
nd when they found some body who didn™t go to 
work, they took to block 25. And I took this risk. I sa

Q: We  were talking about the first 
job that you had in Auschwitz-Birkenau. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Which is after August, 1942. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Which is working in the [indecipherable] 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: This me ans wh-white cap, because  we had this white scarves. 

Q: Scarves, and that™s wh
at you were wearing, I see. 
A: Yeah, that™s it. 
Q: And this was where you 
were sorting clothes? 
A: Yeah, because there was [indecipherable], in -- in Birkenau was a commando sc -- which they 
wore red scarves, so they were 
red scarves and that was the Ca nada
 called. So they were the red 
scarves and we were the white scarves. 

Q: So what was the difference between the wo
rk that you we re doing sorting clothes and the 
work that Ca nada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know? 

A: I couldn™t say exactly. I think that we had from
 the gas chamber, things in the gas chamber, 
and people arrived straight there. And those I 
don™t know. We had that. Maybe they had also 
from the gas chamber, but it was so much that
 they divided there, 
[indecipherable] that. 

Q: And -- and your commando wasn™t 
connected with Canada commando? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
82 
 
 
A: No, no. 
Q: No, it was totally separate. 

A: Yeah, only when -- when the comma ndo was close
d, then we were transf
erred or suggested to 
go there -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- yeah, to Canada. 

Q: Did you like working in that commando?  

A: In Canada, no. 

Q: No, no, the other one [indecipherable] 

A: Yes. 

Q: And wh-why did you like that 
and you didn™t like the Canada? 
A: It was so relaxing there, re
laxing. We relaxing in [indeciph
erable]. The commander, the SS, 
Scharfuehrer, was very nice, a 
nice ma n. He wa s very helpful wh
en it was longer -- for longer at 
zaehlappell, yes, roll call, and dur
ing that time was someti mes a selec
tion after this roll call, so -- 
or when the commanders arrived, then he kept us
 longer there to work. 
We  didn't work, but he 
kept us longer and he phoned into
 the lager that we are very busy, 
that we  have to stay longer, 
and so probably he saved ma ny people. 

Q: I see. 

A: And we had to cross only from one -- from on
e ba -- not barrack, from 
one part to the other 
part through a big door, so we 
-- we avoided the ma in door als
o, by comi ng home  and selection 
we avoided. And then when it was -- it was typhus 
epidemic there, so he let ma ny girls to sit on, 
and not to work. And he asked for tea, for enough t
ea to drink. So he carried in a lot of tea we 
should have enough, fever -- feverish and who coul
dn™t work, didn™t have to work. He was a ma  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
83 
 
 
-- ma  -- nice ma n. That was very important. Andthe other one, ma ybe he was also nice, but I 
didn™t like him, he was s o noisy. During the first 
lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we 
ate, he said lie down all of you. We  had to put
 the food down an-and to 
lie down in the mud. And 
then when -- after work, the 
girls -- not always, I wasn™t th
ere for a -- for a few days, but 
some ti me s we had to undress and so he looked th
rough ours if we didn™t take some thing. He was 
so s -- crazy. Didn™t like it.  

Q: Do you reme mber the name  of 
this nice ma n [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, I think it Ambrose. 

Q: Ambrose. 

A: I think that Ambrose was his name, I think so. Or some thing similar, because we called hi m 

Scharfuehrer. 

Q: Right. Were you surprised that there would 
be  some body who was so nice in that position?  
It™s an odd position to 
be in and then -- 
A: I wasn™t surprised, I was pleased. 

Q: Mm. So how did it happen that you move
d fr om this commando?  It was closed? 
A: It was closed. He -- it was closed, but in th
e meanti me he wasn™t mo re there, the other one, 
somebody else came. I don™t know what -- sometimes 
they placed to other places. Maybe he was 
too nice, I don™t know, but
 -- what the reason. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: And the other one, he  wasn™t for long there, 
but he suggested me  there for, because one day 
he came and he asked, who knows the difference betw
een pure silk and artificial ma terial. I say, I 
know it, cause I learned at schoo
l. So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk 
lingerie to take out and to bundle it differe
ntly. So he knew that I am not stupid. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
84 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: I was -- I was quiet, but I knew things. And th
en the other one, the new one from Ca nada 
asked, ﬁWha t™s your na me?ﬂ And I didn™t answer [ind
ecipherable] say -- so he said, ﬁHow is she 
-- how is she smart, she doesn™t know how to ta
lk even.ﬂ And he said, ﬁYes, she knows how to 
talk.ﬂ So he took me . But I didn
™t like him, you know, it was -- fo
r -- for a Auschwitz, wasn™t the 
attitude, not the -- the gi rl s they were used to
 him, so they laughed, they joked with him. 
Q: Yeah [indecipherable] but you didn™t -- 

A: I couldn™t, no. Didn™t want to. 

Q: We re these commandos protected 
commandos, there were no selections? 
A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: There were selections? 

A: We re selection. They came also later from Ca
nada. They came also later, so some time s they 

avoided selections. But this one
 [indecipherable] be avoided. On
ce happened that in the morning 
one girl didn™t arrive, and some body told him. He
 was -- she was selected 
in the afternoon, or in 
the morning. So he t-took his bike and he went ther
e, and then in -- he returned, he said that he 
told them that she™s the best wo
rker in his commando, when they will
 not return her, then she has 
to -- he has to close the commando, s o then he brought her back. 

Q: And he brought her back. 

A: Yeah, he was a -- 
a really -- a good ma n. 
Q: But were there se lections inside the commando? 

A: No. 

Q: Only from the barrack? 

A: The -- not from barrack -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
85 
 
 
Q: The say -- zaehlappell, when you -- 
A: Zaehlappell, or when they arrived -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- when we arrived from work or so. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Or that time  when I me t this Dieter Rishte
r, and we™re standing the 
whole Sunday, after, when 
we came into the lager, there was a ditch, a ditc
h. So we had to jump through the ditch. And who 
didn™t ma ke it, went to chamber.  

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you had to jump over the ditch? 

A: Yeah, through, through. 

Q: Through it? 
A: Through it. It™s a ditch like th
is, yes, from her e  to there. 
Q: Oh, you mean -- so you went --  
A: Over -- 

Q: -- over it -- 

A: -- over the ditch. 

Q: -- over it from one side to the other. 

A: Over -- side to over. 

Q: And if some one fell -- 

A: I-I wasn™t ther e, but -- 

Q: That™s what you were told? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
86 
 
 
A: -- the back -- they said from the front that 
who cannot jump over, they take you away because 
[indecipherable] standing there, but it was before. 
Q: So when you went to the Canada
 commando, you didn't stay for very long. 
A: No, no. 

Q: How long? 

A: Few days, and I wer -- 

Q: A few da ys? 

A: -- no, for a few days, for a few -- 
and then I went to Ausenkomma ndo. 
Q: And that was less difficult for you. You liked
 that better, being out
side [indecipherable] 
A: I decided. I decided I go rather to Ause
nkommando, what will happen will happen. And then, 
from that, what I -- it was a good decision becau
se I would have stayed in Canada. But from 
Ausenkommando -- Ausenkommando I took a [indeciphe
rable] a risk. Say that™s enough, now I 
have to do some thing else. So -- and then I became  a Laeufe rin. 
Q: And how did that happen?  Can you explain? 
A: Yeah. That was risky. There was -- was a Ra
pportfuehrer, an SS, his name  was Hans Tauber, 
Austrian. He was very bad, he was very bad. Al
ways on the back and he was hitting. He had 
always something in his boot, he
re, some  -- some -- I don™t know
, [indecipherable] or what. He 
was hitting -- 

Q: A whip?  Yes? 

A: -- he -- every pers -- yes, 
he was hitting, and he was sel
ecting, he was everything bad. The 
both men in the la -- the both -- both men in the 
lager. And I heard that they will open the other 
entrance, other entrance to the 
lager from the outside, entrance 
[indecipherable] and that they 
will need Laeuferins, you know Laeuferin?  We ll, 
it™s like they send, run here, run he re, there™s a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
87 
 
 
Laeuferin come , go to the other doo
r [indecipherable] go to this ba
rrack, to this block and so -- 
so they needed, I hear d that. So I deci ded -- deci
ded, I says, I will talk to
 Tauber, the worst. And 
after the appell, after 
that zaehlappell, I was on the road, on the sidewalk and he went on his 
bike, this strong Tauber. And I 
stopped him from the bike, an
d I said, Herr Rapportfuehrer, 
haftling [speaks German here]. Mr. Rapportfuehrer
 -- you will understand, yes, that want to talk -
- talk to you. So he went down from t he bike, 
and was standing looking at
 me . And I said, I am 
here from the very beginning -- it was true. I 
didn™t say it between I 
was a [indecipherable] 
beginning, and I am -- I worked in Ausenkomma
ndo. And I know that you are the only one who 
can help me . I heard that you need Laeuferin, ot
her Laeuferin. I would lik
e to be a Laeuferin. 
And he said, ﬁGo to Katya,ﬂ she was the -- the -- 
the ma in registrar. Yeah, the Schreibstuber, 
Katya Singer. ﬁGo to her and say that I send you th
at she should place you 
in a other block where 
the Laeuferins are.ﬂ So, thanks a 
lot. And I let --  ra n to Katya Si
nger, and I said, Tauber send me . 
She said, I need a -- a written note from Tauber.
 Couldn™t do anything else
. Next day -- morning, 
I went to Ausenkomma ndo again, and then in the 
evening when it was zaehlappell, he came  to 
the block, and he was choosing the 
other girl for Laeuferin. So I 
went out to him, and I said, 
ﬁHerr l-lager -- Herr Rapportfuehrer, I spoke toyou yesterday and I went to Katya Singer, and 
she said that she wants -- she needs from you a not
e, a written note.ﬂ She didn™t say -- he didn™t 
say anything, he said to the -- turned to the bloc
ka lteste and sa id, ﬁTake he
r also to Katya, take 
both to Katya.ﬂ So she took us to Katya, and I became  Laeufer i n. And then I was safe, I didn™t go 

to selections, and I had a bed for myself, 
I had a ni ce block. Became an [indecipherable] 
Q: Did you -- did you know of Katya  Singer be
fore?  Had you me t her when you were in 
Auschwitz one, or -- 

A: No -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
88 
 
 
Q: No. 
A: -- in Auschwitz one I didn™t meet her. 

Q: You didn™t. 

A: No. 

Q: But you knew about her -- when he said Katya Singer you knew -- 

A: I -- everybody knew. 

Q: Everybody knew? 

A: Everybody knew [indecipherable] he di

Q: Katya, and you knew it. 

A: Go to Katya, everybody knew Katya. 

Q: Did you know also that Tsipi, Hele
n Teshauer was working with Katya? 
A: Yes, they -- 

Q: At that -- by that time you -- 
A: No, no, no, no. 
Q: No. 

A: I didn't know anything about Tsipi, 
Tsipi disappeared. I 
spoke once to her. 
Q: And that was it? 

A: And that was -- no, no nevermore. 

Q: Okay, ne -- nevermore. 

A: No, only when I spoke to her by phone, she saidthat she wa s in Novaki with Katya, and then 

they said, I never saw you and I forgot about you. 
She said sh -- I went to ask Katya and she put 
me some -- some -- somewhere -- some nationality, 
this statistics [indecipherable] because I said 
-- I went because, you know, through this, this, I sa
id no, I don™t know about. I went every day to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
89 
 
 
the Schreibstuber because a -- [indeci
pherable] and I had this statisti
c, take to the Schreibstuber. 
She said that was for me. I worked on that. 
Q: Right. Do you have -- how would you 
describe Katya, what was she like? 
A: Very nice. 

Q: She was nice? 

A: Very nice. Very nice person. 

Q: It was a very big position for a Jewish wo ma n , wasn™t it? 

A: Very big. 

Q: In that situation. 

A: Very big position and she was 
very friendly, nice looking, eleg
ant, very friendly. And then 
she was sent or wanted to [indecipherable] no, I 
think to bel -- bels -- 
bel -- Bergen-Belsen, how 
you spell that? 

Q: Bergen-Belsen?  
A: Bergen-Belsen. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think there she went, Bergen-Belsen. Yeah.

A: Always running. 

Q: You™re always running and 
doing errands and sending me ssages -- 
A: Messages. 

Q: -- cause there is no phone system. 

A: Like a messenger here. 

Q: Like a messenger. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
90 
 
 
A: Yeah, like a me ssenger. I think that they had so
me -- some  form in the -- in the main offi ces, 
in the SS, I said -- because I reme mber when 
-- when the other Rapportfuehrerin told me, go 
there to the -- to Lagerfuehrer
in and say that the telephone do
esn™t work. So ma ybe they had 
between them -- 
Q: Yeah, right, but -- 

A: -- between one and entrance and the other entrance, they had some thing, yes. 

Q: -- but not -- but obviously not
 all through the whole system. 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

Q: So -- this is going to sound 
like a really stupid question -- 
A: No, nothing is stupid. 

Q: -- but is there -- is 
there training?  I mean, wh
a t  did they tell you -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- no. They just say go do this, go do that, whatever -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: No training. 

Q: So where do you start living? You move out fr
om the barrack you were in, and you move into 
barrack four?  Is that
 where all the -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: I moved into another barrack before -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
91 
 
 
A: -- but it four [indecipherable] there transl ator
s, they were Laeuferins before, they lived 
already there in a other barrack. No, I was in bl
ock -- in -- in bar -- in lager A before, yes? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then I was movi ng -- moved into lager B in wooden barracks, wooden. 

Q: Wooden barracks, yeah. 

A: Wooden barracks, and everybody
 had his own bed. And in the same  barrack lived Mala 
Zime tbaum, which run away -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- with her three colleagues there. We stayed 
there, we were [indecipherable] that time  -- we 
stayed there, I don™t know how long, ma ybe a 
month, w -- I don™t know how long, and then we 

were moved to block four, where the Sc
hreibstuber was, the ma in office.  
Q: And -- and you knew Mala Zime tbaum?  

A: Oh yes, sure. 
Q: What was she like? 
A: Was like-- 

Q: How do you reme mb er her? 

A: Very proud girl, very proud. Courageous. 

Q: Courageous. 

A: Courageous. Nice person. Yes, some how -- so 
a little bit proud, proud, 
yes. And when some  
officer came  by car in, I used to go and open the 
door for him, and she was always angry when 

she saw that. Don™t open the door, don™t do anything 
for them. But I wanted. I wanted to be nice 
to them. Not a big thing when I open the door for them. 

Q: Right. And what about the other two, there we
re two other wome n who 
were also Laeuferin -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
92 
 
 
A: Yeah, I think they opened also -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- the door, yes. 

Q: Now, wa s the situation in that bloc
k as good as it was in block four or not? 
A: In which block? 

Q: The -- the earlier block, when 
you were with [indecipherable] 
A: Nobody bothered with us. We  we re Laeuferin, so -- 

Q: Right, so you were safe. 

A: Yeah, this was so private some how, like we were -- we had the same  -- the same  food, we 

didn™t have more than them, at the beginni
ng, yes. But we could go to the -- to the 
[indecipherable] it™s the -- the cl
othing where they had the -- we
 could choose some  dresses, 
some  clothing, so we were well dressed. That was the different. We  could go into the sauna to 

wash -- 
Q: To wash yourself, yeah. 
A: Wa sh my self and the clothing to wash. 
We  could go to the [indecipherable] to the 

[indecipherable] hospital. 

Q: The hospital, yeah. 

A: And I needed very much to go to the [indecipherable] because I was full of pus, full of pus. 

Furuncles, and the big full furuncles they were
 called carbuncles. They had more heads, you 
know?  Whe n I was running, oh ho, now opened the car 
-- full of pus, the carbuncles. Here I had -
- under arm I had pus -- 

Q: And whe r e does that come
 from, what is that-- 
A: Let me  tell you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
93 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: Here I had full of -- I was full of pus. 

Q: Really? 

A: Lack of hygiene. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: La-Lack of nourishment, 
yeah. I survived, but how. 
Q: How?  

A: Yeah.  

Q: Is there medication? Was 
there anything that you took? 
A: No, I -- when I was Laeuferin and there was a Dr
. Ross, a Jewish doctor, and I went to her to 
as -- she gave me  this well known ishtiole, you know
 ishtiole?  So this ma de ripe these -- these 
furuncles and these -- and some
 [indecipherable] she gave me, and -- and I don™t know. And then 
was -- I don™t reme mber , is white ointme nt, was when the furuncle was opened and you put it on, 
white this one. And then slowly, slowly I wa
s nursing myself on my bed when I came, and I 
went to wash myself, to shower mys e lf. And I at
e better than before. So
 it healed, it healed, it 
healed, but I stil
l have scars. 
Q: But in that condition, had you not been 
a Laeuferin, and in a 
protected commando, you 
probably would have been killed, be
cause you would have looked sick. 
A: I didn™t look so sick. 
Q: No?  

A: No. And fortunately, we didn™t 
ha -- sorry, we didn't have to undr -- I don™t reme mber that I 
had to undress. It™s only to
 have straight shoes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
94 
 
 
A: To walk straight. 
Q: Right. 

A: Fingers, we have to go like this, and I don™t 
know what, a lock, you know. That what -- would 
have been worse and worse and worse, yes. For sure -- for sure it wouldn't help. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: It wouldn™t help, yeah. 

Q: We re you surprised at the conditions in 
block four?  That everybody had -- you had your own 
bed, and -- 

A: I wasn™t surprised. 

Q: You weren't? 

A: No. 

Q: You knew that that was -- 

A: Yeah, because they looked nice, they looked healthy, ye s. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then in -- in a four -- block four, there we
re girls from the [indecipherabl e] where the s -- 
the non-Jewi sh people, they received parcels, th
ey received packages a
nd some  of them, they 
died, but not in the cham
ber, not the non-Jewish. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So they were always on the left overs of
 packages. So and gir -- the gi rls from the 
[indecipherable] from this package place, they lived
 also in block four. So they had permission, it 
was a ver -- extras. They had permission to bri
ng in, [indecipherable] they gave us something 
[indecipherable] all we ha -- we received from th
ere some [indecipherable] something that we -- 
so, was not a problem, or because they ate from th
ere, so more food stayed in -- of our portions, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
95 
 
 
you know?  So then it became, Laeuferin, we had 
enough food to dinner. We had food, we had 
water, so we were saved. Only some
t hing accidentally could happen that -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- for some  reason -- because anyt hing was a reason there, he had to send us to -- 

Q: Now, are you saying that you di
d not know tsip -- Tsipi, Helen 
Teshauer in block four?  So 
she was in that block -- 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t -- you never -- you never saw her? 

A: No. Interesting, huh? No. 

Q: So there are what, about 
90 or a hundred women there. 

A: Or more. 

Q: More. 

A: Just a half a block, half. 
Q: I see. 
A: Because the Schreibstuber was, the office was, and then we had three a-a-and ma ybe five, 

ma ybe [indecipherable]no, ma ybe, not more 
-- no, for sure no hundred. Less than a hundred. 
Q: Less than a hundred. 

A: Yeah. But she was in front. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: There were rules. Katya has the room. 

Q: Right. 

A: Mala had the room, her three colleagues had 
the room. Together, Mala and her three. And 
Tsipi said that she had, I don™
t know, that she had her own ro
om also, so we passed by -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
96 
 
 
Q: But she often worked at night. 
A: Tha -- Tsipi? 

Q: Tsipi. So ma ybe that™s why you didn™t see her, you know. 

A: Yeah, it could be, yeah. 

Q: But it seems funny that
 you didn™t see her. 
A: Yeah, yes, yes.  

Q: You wou l d see Katya. 

A: I would see Katya [indecipherable] in the office, yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: And I knew her. 

Q: And you know her, yes. 

A: Knew her so I noticed her. 

Q: Right. 
A: There were also others which Tsipi me n
tioned, do you know -- did you know this -- this -- 
Q: Right. 
A: I said no, I didn™t know, because they were 
sitting beside  the -- behi nd their desk, so -- 
Q: So you didn't know. 

A: -- I didn™t bother. 

Q: You knew Anna Pilarchik, Hanka. 

A: Hannah -- Hanka. 

Q: Hanka. 

A: She was the blockalteste. 

Q: Alteste, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
97 
 
 
A: And then was the other one, a tall one, I don™t reme mber her name . 
Q: So how did people get along -- 

A: Very good. 

Q: -- in that? Was it 
good?  It was okay? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So did you now feel if the war ended -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- that you would be safe? 

A: Yes. No. I felt safe. I felt safe, but still I di dn™
t think so far, because as I said at the be ginning, 
I was afraid, or I -- I thought that the last da y they
 will kill us all, they will throw a bomb, or -- or 
I don™t know how [inde cipherable] what way -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- but they -- they will kill us, yeah. 

Q: Now, did you me nstruate, did you get your period? 

A: No. 

Q: You ne -- you didn™t get it even then, because
 some  wome n there were getting their periods. 
A: When we  came, the first day we™re in 
the sauna, everybody had me nstruation, everybody, 
from fear, maybe [indecipherable] and that was -- 

Q: No, but I mean in block four. 

A: No. In block four for sure they got -- they

Q: Right. 

A: Katya for sure didn™t eat with brom. For sure
 not and I don™t know Tsipi and the other ones, I 
don™t know. 

Q: Right. 

A: Those which they worked with the [indeciph
erable] they didn't eat 
there probably, I don™t 
know, maybe someti mes, but that was not the main dish, but for me still it was the main dish. 

What I got extra was only extra. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: So describe what a day mi ght be like

A: Who wer e  they?  Mainly Rapportfuehrerin, the 
Rapportfu -- SS, or from the office also, from 
the office. I was sent some ti me s from the o
ffice. Some body, I don™t know who, gave the order, 
but somebody -- maybe Tsipi was also among the -- 
I don™t know. That™s 
interesting, that was 
life there. So me  -- I told you, she 
said that once we went for -- to
 -- we were sent together for 
stationeries to bring for the o
ffice from some  -- I said, I don™t 
reme mber that, no. So -- but --  
Q: So she reme mbers that the two ofyou had me t each ot her in barrack four? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Had seen each other. And you have no recollection. 

A: O-O -- only that, that we went for that -- 

Q: Only that -- right, but -- 

A: -- you see, I was mor e  visible because I was out at the entrance -- 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: -- yes, but she was inside. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. And then everybody knew the name s of the Laeuferin because we  were not ma ny, 

yeah, and they were more of them, s o -- 

Q: Right, right.  

A: -- so -- so -- so -- wa -- I say. 

Q: So some one would --  

A: Yes, from -- 

Q: -- send you -- 

A: Some body would come , anybody from the office, 
for me , and would say today you have to go 
there. Not always, when they needed some body s peci
al, some body extra, so they said f-first of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

for example, today you will go to Auschwitz -- 
to Auschwitz one, to the [i ndecipherable] you 
know that [indecipherabl e] to the Gestapo let™s sa
y I think, they wear also uniforms. You will go 
there today. [indecipherable]. Or t
oday you will go to the [indecipherable] when they had the lot 
of work. They sent always me
, maybe -- maybe I spoke the best German, probably. You will go 
to that [indecipherable] to the other lager a
nd so on, it was always accompanied by an SS to go 
there, to translate. So therefore I know what they did. So -- 

Q: So you would translate from what to what? 

A: From Polish to German. 

Q: And you knew Polish? 

A: I knew Slovak and that is very -- 

Q: And it™s enough -- it™s close enough.  

A: Close enough. Once happened they translated the Polish and -- and German and then SS 

continued. Hitler [indecipherabl e] spoke in Polis
h. I thought oh my God, how lucky I am that I 
didn™t say anything else. I didn™
t instructed hi m also. Yeah. 
Q: So was a lot of your work doing translations?  Was that a great deal of the work? 

A: The work, yes, even they send, go there, go 
there. You know, it™s one 
block to the other one, 
everybody had to know German. 

Q: Right. 

A: But ma ybe [indecipherable] you had to know
 better to [indecipherable] I don™t know -- 
Q: You don™t know. 

A: Yeah, I -- yeah, I didn't  sp -- we didn™t speak
 in German with my colleagues, girls, no, we 
spoke always in Slovak. 

Q: In Slovak. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
101 
 
 
A: Yes. I cannot judge how far they spoke. 
Q: Right. But you could speak with 
the Polish wo me n who were there? 

A: Yes, we learned. 

Q: [indecipherable] you could -- you
 learned how to speak, yeah. 
A: We  learned, yes, similar. And I came home
 and I spoke to some body Slovak, they continued 
in Polish. 

Q: Polish. 

A: Yeah. Three years, makes a difference. 

Q: Right. All right let™s --  

A: Yeah, you know. 

Q: -- we™re going to take a break

Q: Was there a Christma s celeb
ration of some  kind in bl
ock four that you reme mber?  
[indecipherable] 
A: I don™t reme mber in block four, but I reme mb
er, and some times I think about it, because I 
don™t know where to place the Christma s tree, th
at once was some where a Christma s tree. I was 
thinking about so many times. Because in Auschwitz one coul dn™t be, we were ther e from March 

til -- 

Q: Til August, so -- 

A: August, okay, well no, Christma s -- I don™t kn
ow, but I don™t think that I am -- had a dream 
about it. But some how I -- I -- I 
imagined once a Christmas tree. 
Q: Anna Pilarchik -- Hannah -- Anna -- 

A: Anna -- Hannah -- 

Q: Did report that there was a Christma s 
tree and a celebration in block four -- 
A: Well, then she says -- 

Q: So it™s possible. 

A: Yes, then it™s poss -- then -- 

Q: It™s possible that that™s where you -- 

A: Yes, I -- 

Q: But that -- it™s a vague me mory for you. 

A: A vague me mory, but I picture a Christma s tree some where. So when she said so, then she 

knows. 

Q: Hm. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

Q: At a certain point, when the transports ar
e comi ng in to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and from the 
outside they™re killing so
 ma ny people, do the -- do the internal
 selections get less, so the people 
who are already there -- 

A: I think that yes. 

Q: -- are less likely to be  selected? 

A: I think that yes, yes, I think 
that yes, they didn™t have time. 
Q: Right. 

A: It wasn™t place to burn for ma ny, cause when
 the Hungarian came, it was a time when they 
had to burn outside the crematoriums , yeah. 

Q: Because there was too ma ny? 

A: Too ma ny, yes. 

Q: So what was this like for you, you
™re seeing these peopl
e, you know by now -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- the people are being gassed. 
A: Yes. 

Q: These are not simply people who have died and 
are being cremated, this is a fact ory of killing. 
A: Yes. [indecipherable]. We  we
re standing at the entrance, a
nd in front of us, like you -- no, 
further, let™s say, opened the wagons, cattle wagons
 and stepped out people from there, and they 
were hurrying like [indecipherabl
e], and they holding tight to 
their belongings. They were 
holding tight to their families, and they were hu
ngry and they were thirsty and it was hot. Nearly, 
when they -- when the Hungarian came , this was the 16
th
 of May, hot. They didn™t have enough 
air, they™re smelling an-and shiny. Water was -- 
was running from the [indecipherable] that 
religious me n were in these black caftans with b
eards and with hats. And two of them came  to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
104 
 
 
us, we were two at the entrance and said in Yi
ddish, that you are Jewish children, give to us 
water. They left everybody and they came to us. What could we have done
?  I went to the Ausen, 
and she was -- her name was Grese, Ausen Grese,
 a beautiful lady -- girl
, a little bit crazy, but 
she wasn™t so mean. I went, I said -- and I 
had to report why they came to us, yes, was 
dangerous. So I said, these two men came and they
 ask for water. What can we do?  We didn™t 
have even wa ter. She sa id, don™t bother with them
, because it could happen that they will take 
you also with them. So we were standing, looking 
at them, and didn™t say even anything. It was 
very sad, very sad to see so ma ny pe ople. And th
ey had to leave their belongings, they had to 
leave the families because the SS said line up, line 
up. They were their prisoners also in these 
uniforms. They had to help with the belongi
ngs, their suitcases. But 
they ran all over among 
them, a mong the newcomers and they said -- th
ey suggested, mothers with children, give over 

the children to the grandmothers. Men, you say 
that you are younger. Boys, when you are told, 
you say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a 
trade in -- not in German I don™t know [indeciphe
rable] they could under
stand each other. And 
the SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So s
uddenly in five mi nutes they didn™t have their 
belongings, they didn™t ha ve their families. Some 
mothers, they give over to their gr andmothers, 
some  kept them. They ha d to line up again, me
n to me  -- with me n, wo
me n with women. Wo me n 
-- mothers hold the children, and then came the docto
r, and selected with 
one finger. He didn™t 
bother too much, he didn™t thi
nk too much. And s o they came w
ith a little wand, they took the 
sick ones first, yes, and then they took them. 
The y didn™t know what happened to them. It was so 
sudden that they didn™t know what happened to th
em. And they were carri
ed away. And some  of 
them then came to the lager, but not right 
away, not right away, they took them some  
[indecipherable] place and then they came into. A
nd in a short time  you saw the flames. So that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
105 
 
 
was very often a st -- we were so close, the cr
ematory wasn™t far from the entrance. So often was 
there a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bone
s, very often, more often than not, from the 
burning people. Wa s very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came  and came . 

Never stopped. Wa s time and for weeks nobody cam
e, maybe for a mont h, I don™t know, don™t 
reme mber. It was really when th
e Hungarian came, very often. 
Q: Did you ever want to commit su -- 
did you ever want to commit suicide? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: So -- 

A: I wished only once to die regular,
 when I was left  with a fe w girls in the lager, in this A lager, 
everybody was moved away, and we were -- I had 
the feeling that -- we
 are only ma ybe 10 - 15 
girls, because we stayed behind to ma ke orde
rs there, and nobody took us. [indecipherable] good 
how good will it be to die now, nothi
ng [indecipherable] nothing there. 
Q: Because you were tired, or because -- 

A: I was scared. 

Q: Yeah, uh-huh  

A: Cause was so easy to take us to the gas chambe
r, we were some  extras that time , the emptied 
A lager, they put it in a other one
, and we left -- we were left 
behind to ma ke order there. Made 
order, was ready, and nobody know, nobody took us. 

Q: Now you me ntioned the name
 of a woman guard, Irma Grese, who ma ny people say wer -- 
was very cruel, but that™s now how you reme mbe r  her? 

A: No, because at the -- at th
e entrance, she wasn™t cruel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
106 
 
 
Q: She wasn™t cruel. 
A: No, there, no, there she wasn™t. 

Q: And was that the only time you had seen her? 

A: No, I saw her -- 

Q: You saw her other times?  Bu
t she was never cruel to you? 
A: No, no. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: She was sitting there, it was her 
post there, if she was in a --  
Q: How come  you were there,
 standing at the entrance? 
A: As a Laeuferin. 

Q: Now, wh y was Laeuferin standing
 there, is --  in order to translat e if ther e was a need to 
transl ate, or -- 

A: To translate or -- or like a 
me ssenger, but they needed to send to some  block, some  barrack, to 
say some thing, some  me ssage to give over. 

Q: No, no, no, I mean when the transports are comi ng in. 

A: Yes, that was our post, our place. 

Q: So would you translate for -- the Germans we re not speaking Polish? 

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: So if they would say some thing in German -- 

A: No, no, we didn™t have a
nything to do with tho -- 
Q: You -- having to do with people, nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
107 
 
 
A: No, no, we were there for the SS when they needed somewhere to send this -- a me ssage, yes, 
or when they needed -- let™s say it came
 a -- a prisoner to the door, and they couldn™t 
communicate with them yes, so they 
would ask us, yes, yeah, we did -- 
Q: Now wer e  you also standing when they took the 
fa mily camp, the Theresienstadt camp out to 
be gassed, we re you there?  Am I wrong, or -- 

A: No. The -- it was during the 
evening, or -- late evening, 
summertime. Nobody was there, 
nobody was at the lager, nobody. Some body ca me  only fr
om the office and told me , you have to 
stand between that -- not in the 
front. The -- the Theresien lager wa
s cross the street from -- from 
Birkenau [indecipherable] lager. But between 
the A and B lager was a door, yes. Nobody was 
there, and from the -- as I said, from the 
office they -- some body came, I don™t reme mber who, 
and said, you will stand today between A and B lage
r, that is your post in the evening. I didn't 
know the reason why I will stand there, so I went
. I would have gone also [indecipherable] cause 
I had to when they send me . They™re sending -- 
standing, and as I said, nobody was in the lager, 
it was not permitted, because the guar ds stay there on the towers, and suddenly I heard a cry, and 

-- and -- and -- and running around, and so -- and 
that was the time when they took the people 
from Terezín lager, or  the family lager it was 
called. Because it was like 
that that this famil -- 
those families fr om Theresienstadt , they were together, and that was called fa mily lager. And 

later on only when I am here, so I read some wh
e r e that it was written on the -- on the wagons, 
SB, Sonder Behandlung, and that meant -- that what 
they write in the book, 
that meant that six -- 
for six mont hs, or -- I think six months, they had 
to stay there as a family, and then they sent 
them. And t hat time , that evening, or that night
 when I was late night there, they -- in the 

morning I heard -- in the morning some body said that they put them on -- on the -- on tracks, on 

tracks they put them, on car -- on tracks, they took them to the city of Auschwitz, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
108 
 
 
carried them the whole night all 
over, to -- to -- 
to mi x them up, that th
ey don™t know where they 
are going, and then they put them in the warehou
se, or some where into a place, I don™t know, I 
wasn™t there, and then they gassed them there, 
in some  warehouse, or somewhere, a place. That 
was -- I wasn™t there -- 
Q: Not in Auschwitz, that™s the pl -- 

A: In Auschwitz, but outside of the -- not in th
e gas chamber. Outside of Auschwitz that time . 
Other time s I don™t know, because they gassed them other time s also. And then in the morning, 

or the next  day I heard that in one barrack th
ey found a place where a teac
her was there, and he 
wrote down everything what happened in the 
lager that night. That what I know --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- people said, I wasn™t there. 

Q: Right. 

A: I wasn™t there. I was standing between the 
two barracks, between two lagers, which didn™t 
have anything to do with Theresienstadt, only
 the noise. Maybe that nobody should be outside, 
but there were the guards. That I know about Theresiens -- 

Q: But being outside and watching that
 must have been very upsetting. 

A: Yes, for sure. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I was the only one outside 
and over me  the soldiers -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- on -- on the towers.  

Q: What about the wome n™s orches
tra, was that important for you? 
A: Oh, Al ma Rosé. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
109 
 
 
Q: Al ma  Ro sé. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Tell me  about it 

A: It™s the nicest thing maybe ther
e, only one nice thing in lager,
 what I -- what I experienced, 
Al ma  Rosé. She came at the beginning some ti me s when I was Laeuferin, and I c -- became  

Laeuferin, it was still warm. [indecipherable] reme
mber -- I reme mber her dress, it was satin, 

black dress with polka dots. Pale -- 

Q: With polka dots? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Pale, little bit chubby in -- in face. And 
she came from Auschwitz, from block 10, because 
they brought her -- she was deportated from Holland -- from Holland, they took her for an 

experime nt to the block -- bl-block 10 where I 
was before, became  an experime ntal block, yeah. 
Q: This is in Auschwitz one? 

A: Auschwitz one. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I was in Birkenau. So they took her there, an
d some body said there that 
she is a big musician, 
yeah. And they -- some body I think me  -- some body™s birthday was -- I don™t know whose, so 

they are order f -- ask her to play on -- on a viol
in [indecipherable] a violin she play. And she 
was a real big musician, because they played toge
ther with he r father in Vienna, Austria. She 
ma rried through Holland, so they b -- they s -- brought her from Holland, yes. She me ntioned 

that sh -- her second husband was a Czech, because 
I said I am Czechoslovakian. And so -- so -- 
so they took her from this experime ntal block, 
and they brought her to Birkenau, and they ma de 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
110 
 
 
her as a [indecipherable] after 
[indecipherable] maybe. So she was playing with them. She had 
such a small stick, a thin stick play, and she used 
to complain that her stic
k is too heavy for her, 
and we used to laugh that this is heavy for Al ma
 Rosé, and we use all equipment, we have to 
work and so -- so -- and she played beautiful
. For Sundays some ti me s, or more often, I don™t 
reme mber if every Sunday, she played by hers
elf. I-I was young, and I-I didn™t go to these bi g 
places and so -- but I couldn™t imagine something 
nicer than she -- when she play -- when she 
play, and there came also high rank officers we
re standing around and playing -- and listening. 
Q: So it was actually a recital. It  was -- or ju -- was she just  pr acticing? 

A: She played with the orchestra, but some  days 
she was playing, like an au -- like a concert in 
tibe -- 

Q: Really. And where would this be, 
where in Auschwitz would this -- 
A: Just a place where I -- where my duty was, 
in the entrance of block B, where the people went 
to work. 
Q: I see. 
A: So when -- when they went to work, to th
e orchestra played these ma rch songs, and ma rch 
music, they should -- they should ma rch in-in milita
ry steps, ye s. And we had to lead them by -- 
shall I tell you how? 

Q: Mm. 

A: By [speaks German here], yes. When some bo
dy didn™t ma rch well, so change there, they had 
to ma rch in that -- 

Q: So they had to ma rch in unison, together? 

A: Together yes, in lines, and she played with 
her orchestra. We had to tell them how to ma r -- 
how to start and so on and so. And when they ca
me and returned from work, they had to march 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
111 
 
 
also by we -- without orchestra when they retu
rn, I think without. We  ha d to lead them, but 
some ti me s we didn™t, when nobody was there from the SS. [indecipherable] She was ha -- she 
was a music i an, oh mi ne God, never her [indecipherab
le] yeah and then she died. It was April the 
fourth, I remember. I reme mber it from -- from
 reading. April the fourth, 1944, when we heard 
Al ma  Rosé die. She was invited 
to a party and they said that 
she was poisoned there. And then 
they came [indecipherable] we began with the orchestra, which wasn™t the same . 

Q: It wasn™t the same . 

A: No, not -- there were concerts and 
even not -- it wasn™t Alma  Rosé. 
Q: Now, there are some  people who think they
 reme mber the orchestra playing when people 
went to the gas, and other people sa
ying there was never an orchestra. 
A: Never an orchestra? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I wished only -- that was my wish, that when I will go to gas, it should be -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- Alma Rosé should accompany me and it 
will be easy for me . That was my wish. 
Q: So the music for you was really important. 

A: Very important. This was the 
only one thing what was nice for me . 

Q: Did you know that Ts ipi was in the 
orchestra, that she played ma ndolin? 
A: No. No. She was?  She was there? 

Q: She played ma ndolin and when they went -- th
ey -- they ma rched out, so they would play for 

people who were going to work, they would come
 by block four and pick her up, and she would 

go with them and play. I don™t know if she ev
er played concerts, 
but she played -- 
A: No, I don™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
112 
 
 
Q: You didn't know that. 
A: -- I see she was there every day -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- we -- we -- we saw each other. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Because when the transports they cam
e, I wasn™t every time there because -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- we exchanged duties, but 
in the morning I was there. 
Q: In the morning you worked, she wa s playing [indecipherable] know. 

A: Interesting. I know, well, people were co
mi ng, going and we didn™t -- we didn™t even know 
they [indecipherable] but no, we didn™t think ab
out, because we couldn™t think about so ma ny 
people. 

Q: Right. But other than your
 friend Dieter Rishter -- 
A: Dieter Rishter. 

Q: -- did you have another -- any other clos
e friends, or was she the closest person? 
A: She was the closest person. I had fr iends then, also. 

Q: Yes, but she was really -- 

A: She was the closest person.  

Q: So that was very hard on you to lose her. 

A: Very hard, still hard. 

Q: Still hard? 

A: Yeah, Dieter Rish
ter [indecipherable] 
Q: I see what you™re saying. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
113 
 
 
A: Still hard. See, once she went by her -- on he
r own to -- in front of block 25, some how once I 
lost her during the day, ma ybe 
it was Sunday, I came to the block and asked, where is rish -- 
where is Dieter?  Some body said she went to bl
ock 25. With some  of the m, that was suicide 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: They were sitting there and waiting til they open
ed the door, and I --  it was in fr ont of -- of 
the lager, so the first -- in the 
first row from the door -- from th
e -- from the e -- entrance, where 
the SS were, so they could see the -- and I went th
ere, and I said, ﬁDieter, come .ﬂ She said no. I 
tried to pick her up, and -- and -- 
and I -- I had to fight with her, 
I fought with her, Dieter, come , 
come . She s a id, ﬁNo, it™s not your life, let me  -- l
eave me  alone. I want to die, I want to go.ﬂ And 
it was also a risk, some body sees me , then go with
 her. But I ma naged to pick her up and he 
came wi -- she came with me. She came back to that barrack. She was very close to me, I liked 

her very mu -- nice girl, a simple, 
nice, good girl. Yeah, 
nice girl, Dieter. 
Q: We re -- the -- the wome n that you saw, did 
most of them have one very close person? 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know how they -- how it was working. 

A: I don™t know -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because I know that ma ny of them, they came to sleep, they left and so -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
114 
 
 
A: I don™t know, and I don™t -- didn™t know inthe commando, also the name s. I don™t know, I 
don™t know, probably yes. Nobody wants to be lonely. 

Q: Right. Did you ever see me n comi
ng into the camp and working? 
A: Some times, yes. First of all from t he gas chambe
r, they deliver to us this clothing, we worked 

on it [indecipherable] they pulled like 
-- like horses, they came there. 
Q: Wa sn™t it the case that there was some
 -- some body who was working the Sonderkommando, 
who spoke with you about what happened?  Some
 person who saw you in Auschwitz, and talked 
to you, who came in the women™s cam
p?  Didn™t you write about that? 
A: Yes, it happened -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- happened, yes, happened, I don™t know 
if I wrote about it, but it happened.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I had there a friend, also a ma n. He was so sick and so -- a Polish ma n, his nose was -- was 
running and so [indecipherable]. And once he ca
me  we had the little [indecipherable] with 
[indecipherable] a little pi ece of sa
lami . And he asked -- this was 
winter, I should boil it for him, 
I should ma ke him a soup. Not wa -- this was sick and I ma de it for him and then he came  
always, he br ought a -- a piece of bread and sala
mi , or only bread, to ma ke him a soup and so 
[indecipherable] but not 
so some body should see. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: [indecipherable] the back, and he
re and there, or -- or he drew 
me a -- a -- a letter or a pictur e 
or so. And so I learned about his 
life before and so -- so I knew
 about him. And then I was so 
happy when I saw him with a mi rror to look in, an
d his cap, he fixed up and so [indecipherable] 
Q: Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
115 
 
 
A: So happy. And then when he became  ma ybe t he 
nicest looking boy from that place, yes, that 
commando, yeah.  
Q: He found a mi rror?  This was after the war, this was -- 

A: During the war, during it 

Q: -- during?  He found a mi rror and so he was fixing hims elf up. 

A: Yes, and before he was -- his nose was running and so -- yes. But in some ti me s they pass 

through when they brought -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- other things, they said some thing and so -- so we knew the name s from those who -- 

Q: But there were a number of times when 
you actually saved people,
 you risked your life. 
A: I did. 

Q: Not just with -- with your frie
nd Dieter, that was very dangerous
 to go into block 25 to bring 
her out. 
A: Not to, in front. 
Q: In front, even in front. 

A: Yes, I -- 

Q: Cause clearly she was waiting. 

A: Yeah, yes. I did steal people, saved. 

Q: And how did you do that? 

A: Once five people, from Mengele -- from 
Dr. Mengele, when I was Schreiberin, you know, 
registrar. And when they emptied block A -- barra
 -- yeah -- were -- lage
r A they emptied, yeah. 
So our block had to -- the Jewish wome n, they ha
d to assemble in -- in the sauna. The sauna, to 
go to the sauna, I had to go with them as the 
shi -- block Schreiberin we
nt to write down who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
116 
 
 
stays in, so -- and at the door
 was Mengele, and a other prison
er, Slovak doctor, she wasn™t 
finished [indecipherable]. She play
ed the doctor, the wise Irna. 
Wa s a -- a door with him -- with 
me ng -- Dr. Mengele, and they had to line up an
d to go through the door where he was standing, 
and it was a small room, and there all -- the small room on the other room, yeah, life or death. 
And my father™s si ster wa s there,
 my father™s sister, my aunt. And I said to Irna, my aunt is 
comi ng, help me , yeah. Said, tell me  when she will be  here. And she was on the way, I said, she 

is comi ng, yeah. [indecipherable] because Meng
ele was the -- she said, I cannot help you, you 
help yourself. I knew that she canno
t -- couldn™t help me , we tried. So I didn™t -- I could not help 
neither, so I let her go through sele
ction, he selected her. Then came a other one from the city 
where I was -- where I became married, because my 
uncle was [indecipherable] so I knew her, I 
me t her there. So they were ma ybe 45, or so, yes, the nine hun -- 19 -- ma ybe 45 years, around. 

So I let her also go, I let everybody go, he sele
cted, yes. Then came -- then came a Hungarian 
wome n from Budapest, I let her also go, and I le
t everybody go yes, and I waited til Mengele will 
leave, and then I went to the little room wher
e they -- those two -- two 
-- two -- that selected 
were, and I said silently, [indecipherable] is
 -- is in Hungarian, lik
e end, I said, Frieda 
[indecipherable] come . [indecipherable] with one
 hand, and I took them out from there, from 
commandos. And then I saw there a si
ster of one girl which was sent
 to live, yes, so I went to 
her, come . And then was there this lady from Bu
dapest, and she said Aliska, and I saw there in 

the back, a girl, she was ma ybe 16 
ye ars old, also Hungarian, I said 
yes in -- in Hungarian, yes if 
she prom -- and I had the girl shon -- als -- shon 
-- I had the girl where my
 hand, I carried her. I 
said yes, will you promise me  that you will be he
r mother?  She said yes, I promise you. So I put 
the two -- two together, and I took them out. So 
that time I took five people out from Mengele. 

Was a risk. And then my cousin, which I 
said, from she was already in block 25 --

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Okay, before we talk about 
your saving Vera Isen, tell me  wh
at impelled you to do this?  It 
was so dangerous, you could have be
en caught in a second and killed. 
A: Yes. I knew it. 
Q: What ma de you do it?  How -- 

A: S -- to save people. I didn™t th
ink about the danger. I knew that I 
have to do it, be -- that I -- 
since I ha d th-the opportunity, it was a way til -- 
til -- I knew that it was a way how to take them 
out, so I had to do thi -- I -- I had to do it. 

Q: And nobody saw you, Irma didn™t see you. Irma  -- irm -- was Irma Weiss, right? 

A: Irna. 

Q: Irna, rather, right. 

A: No, I don™t know, she left with him, but I told he
r that I wa nt to save my aunt and she said, I 
cannot help you, you help yourself. 
Q: Right. 
A: So probably she --  

Q: She knew. 

A: -- knew probably, I don™t know. I never spoke to he
r before and after, that she was working in 
the -- really in the [indecipherable] house. 

Q: But if they were going through 
the -- th -- the process,
 this wasn™t outside, 
this was inside -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- were they not taking down name s?  

A: No, no. That was -- 

Q: They can -- not that -- it wa
s just n -- just moving people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
119 
 
 
A: Just moving people. 
Q: I see, so -- 

A: This was my work.  

Q: I see, so they can -- ther
e was no way to check if you -- 
A: No, they di -- couldn™t check, no. They left, 
he didn™t reme mber whom he sent because he 
sent a lot of people. 

Q: I see. Now, there were 
other people in that room. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did they realize what 
you were doing, or you don™t know? 
A: See, no, wait. I had bad conscience about 
one woma n, who saw what was going on -- on, but 
that was my limit, I could not -- but, I am 
happy ho -- what happened, okay?  She was a real 
musselman, you know what™s musselm
an, you he ard this expression? 
Q: That was people who were deteriorated
 and -- and close to
 death also, right. 
A: Yeah. She was tall, and very skinny, and she 
came to me and she said, help me, because she 
saw, she saw. I said, I cannot, because when I ta
ke yo -- if I take you out, everythi ng wis -- will 
collapse, I™m sorry, I cannot. And I left her there.
 But my conscience was very bad, that oh my 
God, she died and so and so. Til once happened 
that some body told me  af
ter the war, that a 
woma n, very tall and skinny, a real musselman, sh
e some how ca me  to the lager, to the other 

lager. 

Q: So she escaped herself. 

A: She escaped herself, and I was very quiet a
nd very happy. Til then, ti
l I didn™t hear it, my 
conscience was very bad. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
120 
 
 
A: But I coul dn™t, because  five people, I had to risk five people and myself.  
Q: Right. 

A: That was the limit and I couldn™t go even back to take more, five. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Too much time. [indecipherable] 
them, too mu ch time, I couldn™t. 
Q: And wha t  gave you -- were you holding onto this
 young -- this 16 year old girl when you said 

to this ot her woma n if 
you -- if you will take -- 

A: Yeah, I just took her. 

Q: You just took her. 

A: I just took her, I went to her, I didn™t 
say anything, she didn™t know what -- what I am doing. 
Q: [indecipherable] you just took her. 

A: I took her, I hold her, and this lady said 
-- she was a little bit c
hubby, I don™t know if she was 
50, that time 50 was old. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And she said, Aliska. And I said yes. And you pr
omise me that you be a -- be a mother to this 
gi -- to this child, I take you. Said, I promise you. 

Q: And wha t  brought -- 

A: And I -- I put them together, the hands and  

Q: -- together. And what ma de you th -- I unde
rstand this was some  instinctual thing -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- o-on your part, but what ma de you say that
 to her?  Because you di
dn™t think that the 16 
year old would survive if 
she didn™t have somebody? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
121 
 
 
A: Yeah, she was very young, according to this set up. Yeah, she was not -- she needed 
some body, I  think so. 

Q: Did they sur -- di d they survive? 

A: Yes. No, I don™t know about the Hungarian 
woma n, but I know about the girl that she 
survived becau -- it happened my -- my root
s, you know, I met so ma ny people there which -- 
which they belonged to -- belonged to me . I me
t a -- a b -- a -- a woma n which was very handy 
there and very nice when I was Schreiberin, and 
said stay, and she worked always some thing 
other, I said, stay here, be a -- be a Stubendienst
, yes, a servant here. And she stayed and worked 

and so [indecipherable] after my work and after 
the war I went to the city Koshitzer, and I met 
her on the street and she said, come , visit us [i
ndecipherable] go to a restaurant, she said come , 
visit us and we™ll have supper with us. So I sa
id, what™s your name  and 
what -- I knew her first 
name  -- I said what™s your name  and what™s your 
address. So she said her name  and I said, we 
have here a relative, who work th
ere and there and there. She said 
that™s my so -- my brother-in-
law. She was my cousin™s wife. And she told me
 -- I didn™t say anything to her but she told me  

about this girl that sh
e lives in -- she has this cousin 
or some thing in California, and she 
me ntioned her, described her, so she lived in -- in
 California, in America 
after the war. So I know 
that she™s -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- she survived, that my aunt survived -- she passed away now, this 
lady from ma na -- from 

my husband, the three, I know th
at they survived. I don™t know about Koshitzer, I was in 
Koshitzer, I never asked about her, but I™m sure
 that [indecipherable] was healthy, and I don™t 
know about this Hungarian lady, 
I don™t know. But three I know. 

Q: So tell me  the story about Vera Isen.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
122 
 
 
A: I told you, no?  With my father, aha happen, what happened. 
Q: No, you didn™t. What happened, yeah. 

A: I came to the -- came to the barrack and they
 were sending a nice lo
oking girl, young, ma ybe 
20 or so. I said -- and I knew that she™s not from
 the barrack, because I would know her. I said, 
ﬁ What are you -- are you looking for some body? ﬂ  Sh
e said ﬁYes, I am looking for Aliska Roth,ﬂ 
or for -- yeah. So I said, ﬁ Why are you looking fo
r Aliska Roth? ﬂ  She said, ﬁBecause she™s my 
cousin.ﬂ I said, ﬁYour cousin, what™s your na
me?ﬂ Vera Isen. I said, ﬁOh, so what™s the 

problem? ﬂ  I didn™t say anything to 
her, what™s the problem [indeci
pherable] wasn™t interest to 
talk too muc h. I said, ﬁWhat™s the problem? ﬂ Sa
id, ﬁI am on 20 -- on block 25.ﬂ So I said -- I 
didn™t ask why, I didn™t know why s he™s there. 
I said [indecipherable]
 afternoon, I cannot do 
anything, I will try tomorrow to 
do some thing. Come  with me , I go with you to 25. Since I was -- 
before Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- peopl
e knew me , so I had some position. So I went 
there, there was a Slovak lady, olde
r than -- she was a mothe r  of 
a girl [indecipherable]. I said 
[indecipherable] didn™t ask who 
we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing. I 
said, ﬁNow this is my cousin and she™s here in 
your block.ﬂ It was impo
ssible to take out from 
there. ﬁShe™s in this block, I want to help her,
 but today is no time because late. So I-I -- I will 
come  tomor r ow, so please hide her,ﬂ and I looke
d up there where the dished, and some storage. I 
said, ﬁIf some thing would happen 
during the night, place her there, send her there, she should 
hide there. In the morning I will be  he re.ﬂ She sa id okay. And I am wonde ring how she could do 

that, because she had her on the lis
t, yeah. She says okay. So -- and I went in the mor ning there. I 
said, I came  for my cousin. She says okay, so I took 
her. I took my cousin and I went with her to 

the sauna, because I knew that that  time they we
re sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to 
work, you know, Philips and so on and so. They went there. And there was an SS, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
123 
 
 
[indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me
, because I was standing there. Her name  was 
Ziatz, and I knew she™s a simple woman, older 
woma n, in her 40™s, some how, I never heard her 
voice, she must be a nice woma n. So I went to he
r and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my 
cousin, look how beautiful she is, she is 
nicer looking than I am, I gave her some  
[indecipherable]. And she™s in -- th
e problem with -- with her that
 she™s in block 25. She has to 
go to the gas chamber. And she can go as a nice l
ooking girl, then I can go also. I am not so nice 
looking than her. Please help me
. Se nd her away with 
the -- with these people to Germany to 
work. And she looked, and she said, leave her here. A
nd I left  her there, and I believed her, this 
[indecipherable] I left her there. And that™s it
. And I had the feeling, that™s a good feeling, the 
girl is safe. After the wer -- wa
r, when I came to Preıov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there, 
and we were so [indecipherable
] saw me , knew the name . She sa
id, I was in [indecipherable] 
with the -- they had a -- a grap
e garden. So I me t there Vera Is
en, and she said you should come  
there to pick up grapes. So I said, well I don™t 
know. But I knew that I will not go, I wasn™t the 
mood to travel with grapes, forget
 about it. And then I said, are 
you go back, tell her that I thank, 
that I™m here and I thank, and -- but I will not be 
here, I will be in Hume nné, I go to my uncle. So 
then I received from her a lett
er. I™m not sure if I wrote her 
or she wrote me , that I don™t know. 
[indecipherable] was a little place, Hume nné 
was also a little place,
 was enough to know the 
name , okay, [indecipherable]. So I received a letter 
that she™s with her brother there and they 
want to go to the States, to New York. But that 
time wasn™t permitted from Hungary to write to 
New York, wasn™t permitted some how connection 
[indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote 
me  the address to New York, I should wr-write 
in Hungarian [indecipherable]. So I wrote there, 
and that™s it. I never heard about her, never, neve
r, never. After years and years my cousin from 

Koshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me  that she -- she 
received a letter from 
Israel  -- from Israel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
124 
 
 
from my other cousin, that this 
cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and 
that Vera wi -- Vera Isen was 
there and she™s in this book abou
t Auschwitz, and she said the 
story that the -- she was select --
 she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn™t 
know that time that she had a sister and she had 
a mother there. And the other blockalteste came  
there, and managed -- because she wa s the last on
e, that they took her ou
t from the line, and she 
put her sister or her cousin or some body, this 
blockalte -- some body instead her, and they took 
her from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin 

from Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherab
le] wanted my address wh
ere I live now, to tell 
me  that she™s alive. So I wrote 
to her, but she didn™t write for 
a long time . So I said, when she 
doesn™t write, ask from I s rael her address. [indeci
pherable] I -- I never said
 to her -- she doesn™t 
know the story of my fat her, that my father ha
d her -- I don™t know what 
-- what kind of reli -- 
relative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so 
a fe w -- then she in --  then she invited me  to 
Florida, I should come, I knew that I will not 
go. I said ma ybe. And then she called I shouldn™t 
go for January because he r children are there, sh 
-- I should come for February. And I said, I will 
go rather to -- to New York. Then I had my hi
p operation, I said [indecipherable] called me , I 
said I -- I cannot go because I have
 a hip operation. Then she called 
me again, I said I want to go 
to -- to Washington first, and I will come 
from Washington, maybe I will come to visit you. I 
never went and she never called or never -- 
Q: So you™ve never seen her since that day? 

A: No, I saw her only once. But then I wrote to
 the [indecipherable] my ne w cousin, my new 
cousin. 

Q: Right, right. Did you tell her when you brought 
her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your 
cousin, or you never told her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
125 
 
 
A: No, I told her, oh I -- I -- 
Q: Oh, you did tell her. 

A: -- I -- no, I didn™t tell 
her I am your cousin, I re
acted as I will help you. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I ra -- reacted as a cousin. 

Q: As a cousin 

A: Come, I will help you. But I never wrote to her th
at  my fa  -- what my father told me, that he 
lost his mother, who was an Isen. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And so I me t a few ones. Some  of my 
roots. A few ones [ind
ecipherable] few ones. 
Q: So how do you understand 
yourself doing all of this? 
A: Yeah, I had other times also when I saved. 

Q: Yes? 
A: So -- but how I understand myself, after ma ny 
years -- and I was ha
ppy that I could help. 
After many years I some times ask was it wo
rthwhile. Who cares, nobody cares. If it is 
worthwhile to be a [indecipherable]. Then 
but some ti me s ma ybe. Nobody said ever, thanks. 
Q: Nobody? 
A: Nobody. Nobody. So they were tha
nkful it™s -- my aunt and the 
other lady, but I don™t know if 
it is wort hwhile to risk your lif
e, as I risked my life. I risked
 also [indecipherable] Polish -- I 
wrote it, Polish wome n. They wanted to take th
em to Visla to [indecipherable]. I mean, the SS 

came and he said where are -- I had to line up. It
 was a rec -- convales
cent barrack where they 
didn™t go to work, they stayed there. And he 
came, where are they. Polish wome n. I said, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
126 
 
 
don™t have here Polish wome n. He left, but I had 
statistics, I had -- I wrot
e every day stat -- and 
they would say, show me  your sta
tistics. I finished [indecipherabl
e]. He turned and he left.  
Q: And you had just faked everything? 
A: I didn™t faked anything, it -- my -- my book wa
s there, my notebook was inside in there. 
Q: But he didn™t look. 

A: He didn™t ask. I looked so little, innocent. 

Q: Right.  

A: Yeah, [indecipherable] 

Q: But don™t you, even if people don™t thank you, you 
have some  feeling in yourself about what 
you did. 

A: Yes, yes, sure. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I know that I did the right thing. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I do know that. I™m satisfied. I™m satisfied I did 
the right thing, yeah, even they don™t care, but 
some ti me s I think that nobody -- no, I -- I -- a-
alwa ys when some body -- I did some thing for 
some , ask me what should I [indecipherable] I sa
id, now you want to repay me ?  Yes. Give me  a 
smile. It was always my reaction. Yeah, it was 
very risky. Once some body saw me  fr om the 
sauna, was also a -- some relative that I knew her 
before. And I went to the Schreiberin that time, 
I said, take her a -- take out her name , yeah. She 
said, find me a razor -- an
 eraser. So I went all 
over, I found the eraser, so she wrote through and 
erased, it should be so mi xed up that she ma de 
the mi stake. When I took her out, was evening. Then one Polish lady who was then my  

blockalteste when I was Schreibe
rin with her in the last barr
ack. She came to -- now you stole 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
127 
 
 
this girl, you took her out from 
the -- I said no, no, I didn™t. Sh
e said yes, I saw you. I said no. 
But then when I came onto her barrack, I said -- 
said, you reme mber that evening?  I really took 
her. Yeah. 
Q: But some thing -- something must have been in
 your fa mily, there™s a certain kind of justice, 
or evenness, even what you did 
after the war, that 
even though this woma n had no right to get 
money from you. 

A: No. 

Q: None -- 

A: None, because -- 

Q: -- whatsoever. But you -- it was more impor
tant for you to shut her up essentially -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- so she wouldn™t say nast
y things about your father. 

A: Yeah, was my responsibility -- 
Q: It was your responsibility. 
A: -- I felt. 

Q: And it™s a -- oh, there™s -- th
ere™s some thing, some thing. 
A: Maybe that that my fa ther was a very honest ma n, maybe. Maybe that. Maybe, I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was -- it was this wa y. 

Q: Right. 

A: I was this way. No, 
I didn™t question myself. 
Q: You just did it. 

A: And I was ques --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
128 
 
 
Q: You just did it. 
A: I never question, yeah. Never question what I am
 doing again, so -- have to do it, I do it. I can 
do it, so I do it. 

Q: So you did it. 

A: And that™s -- I looked so -- 
I knew that I looked so innocen
t, a little girl
. Who wouldn™t 
believe a little girl. 

Q: But you know, when you said -- when we we re 
talking before, about ha
ving -- being practical. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: In a situation that was -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- clearly completely crazy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But in order to live in it, you ha
d to think in a practical way -- 
A: I had to think -- 

Q: -- not in some  fantasy land, right? 

A: -- yes. No. 

Q: So you were thinki
ng and strategizing -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and seeing --  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- little wa ys.  

A: Yes, that™s right. I had to --

at we will anyhow die, 
all of you. Again, I didn™t

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
130 
 
 
A: Yeah, it will be over anyway, if I die before, 
or  later, it doesn™t make too much diffe rence,

Q: Right 
A: -- Katya Singer and her. 

Q: Right. 

A: She didn™t have to do it, wasn™t smart. 

Q: Do you have -- given that you knew her a little
 bit, do you have some  understanding of what 
she thought she was doing?  That she -- 

A: Yeah, she was too much courageous -- to much courage. 

Q: Oh. 

A: And too much self confident and proud. As I said -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- she™s a proud women, a proud gi

Q: So do you think in some  ways sh
e™s unrealistic?  Is
 that what --- 
A: Yes, she was unrealistic -- 
Q: Oh, uh-huh. 
A: -- because she could have -- a
nd two -- two weeks after came  he
r sister from Belgium. She -- 
unrealistic because she would survive to the end end, to the last da y. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: For sure to the last day, nobody would touch Mala. 

Q: Right. 

A: Til the last day, and if she 
stays alive -- st ayed alive, she

nd nice, but she knew to put forward her best, 
yes?  

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
132 
 
 
A: She -- you would notice her. Sh
e wouldn™t be this little modest
 woman as I am. I don™t say -- I 
don™t say even that I was in lager. Many people,
 they don™t know, my closest friends, they don™t 
know even. They just -- did I say to Jim, or to
 Mike, I don™t know -- here a ma n who come s for 
25 years every Sunday for supper. 
Q: And he doesn™t know. 

A: He doesn™t know. Now, Hugo said we go to -- 
to [indecipherable] what
 for?  I said, we are 
invited to say about our e-expe
riences, that™s all. And I was thinking about it, and I said 
[indecipherable] to tell him, ma ybe I have 
to say to him that I was in Auschwitz. 
Q: I think so. 

A: Yeah. And he™s a teacher who™s teachi

Q: So show him the interview. 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know, some how that™s my -- 
that™s me , my pers -- 
I don™t know. But not 
ma ny peopl e know. At school, my -- my college, th
ey didn™t know, I didn™t say anything about. 
What should I be special?  But Mala was so
me body, you know. She was beautiful, an-an-and she 
was a personality -- not persona
lity, a leader type, yes?   
Q: Right. 
A: The people, if they come  into somewhere and th
ey will be ri ght away lead -- visibl e, yes?  And 

that was Mala. Wa s not smart. 

Q: No. 

A: Too much self confidence. She went over the 
limit, stepped out from t he lager in SS unifor m. 
Q: In a ma le uniform, right?  She was -- 

A: No, no, no, she had -- 

Q: No? She was [indecipherable] a woma n? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
133 
 
 
A: -- woma n, and he as a ma n. 
Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: And he also had -- very attractive ma
n, s mart and everything, courageous and proud. 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: He did some thing what didn™t ma ke sense, you know? 

Q: Yeah. So when they were caught, were you -- 
were you there when they took her to hang her? 
A: They didn™t hang her. 

Q: I know they didn™t, but weren't 
they -- they were bringing her. 
A: Yes, I was there. 

Q: You were there. So you saw what happened? 

A: Yeah, it was everywhere. 

Q: It was everywhere. So tell me  what you saw. 
A: Yeah. And we were exchange, we were placed in
to -- in-into the blocks, yes, I was -- became  
Schreiberin. And -- 
Q: This is aft -- after her es
cape, they took all of you -- 
A: After her escape -- 

Q: -- out. 

A: -- yeah, and they put 16 years 
old girls, and I had to see the 
Lagerfuehrerin with a me ssage, 
yes?  And I had so -- so much courage that I sa
id to the Lagerfuehr [indecipherable] was the 
Lagerfuehrerin. I said, Fr au Lagerf
uehrerin, is this possible, to 
work with children?  Yeah. Maybe 
I wasn™t [indecipherable] and she said, for us is
 everything possible. Yeah [indecipherable] so I 
left, turned and ran. So after th
at, a few days later, some body c a me  into the barrack and said 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
134 
 
 
Mala is back. She stands on the entrance, she is 
on the entrance. She is back in lage r. They 
brought her [indecipherable] from the prison. And 
then some body said the other one -- I think 
that -- I think that Sally -- Sa
lly was her name, Sal -- I don™t know
, one was Herta, the other one 
was Leah, I think. But the third one, I think 
that™s Sallah, I don™t 
know. And that I don™t 
[indecipherable] that she went to -- to the entran
ce, and she gave her a razor blade, in case she 
has to cut her veins. And then was a whistle and a
ll of us who was in the la
ger, had to go into the 
B lager to stand there. We were standing a
nd they brought, I don™t know 
who ca me  with her, 
Mala. She wa s there to [indeciphe
rable] Mala is here. Wa sn™t so simple. And there was the 
Lageralteste, and was a Scharfuerer [indeciphera
ble]. Lageralteste Mandel, and Scharfuerer 
[indecipherable]. And Mandel, the 
la -- the SS Mandel, she said to
 -- the short speech, and she 
said, we got a me ssage from Berlin, this Mala ha
s to be put into a crematorium alive, alive.  

Q: She said that aloud? 

A: Aloud, for everybody. And whoever would escape, will happen for everybody. And then -- 
then Mala took the razor 
blade, and she cut her forehead -- forehand, yes, forehand like this, and 
turned her arm, and blood dripped from her, and with
 the right hand she slapped this thir -- yeah, 
and the thir -- the [indeciphera
ble] she too -- he took razor blade from her  hand out, so she 
slapped him,  yes. And blood was dripping. And th
en he took her hand down and sent her I don™t 
know, I don™t reme mber  who went with her to the 
[indecipherable] to the 
[indecipherable] to the 
emergency or something like that. They went with 
her, and we were standi
ng there, and then she 
returned and -- and bandaged her forearm, and 
then I don™t -- don™t remember if [indecipherable] 
or there they put her in some  
carriage, and some body pulled her out 
of the lager. And then in the 
morning we heard that when she arrived there 
was an SS ma n, and he said, oh that™s you. He 
recognize her, because  they went out and -- it™s
 you. I will not throw you in the oven alive. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
135 
 
 
[indecipherable] we know that -- knew that 
from the Sonderkomma ndo who worked there, 
some body s a id that he gave her a pill, and -- and here, poison yourself. Or the me r -- there most 
probably was that he shot her -- I will shot he
r -- shot you first. And the third version was that 
she took a pill, that she ha d the poisonous pill. She killed her -- poisoned he rself. And Edek was 

hanged. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Edek was hanged [indecipherable] 

Q: Right, okay. 

A: Mm. 
End of Tape Eight

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: Tell -- explain what a Schrei
berin is. That was your next job 
after the La euferin. What is -- 
what does a Schreiberin do?   
A: She has to have evidence of people, some
body™s placed to the barrack, some body™s placed 
from the barracks. And nationalities, how ma ny those,
 those, those, those, 
those, according, a list 
has to be put together, and to take to the Sc
hriebstuber. Then we ha
d a reconvalescent lag -- 
block. That meant some people, th
ey -- which they were sick and they were not sent to the gas 
chamber, let™s see, the non-Jews, they were not 
sent to the gas chamber, yes. You are sick, you 
went to the Revere, to the [ind
ecipherable]. And then they send them for a few day -- let™s say 
for three days or four or five, six days or [indecipherable] mostly to a reconvalescent block. And 

then you had to place th
em from the reconvalescent block ac
cording to regulations, back. And 
back from there they came, yes. So, when we ha
d to send them back, we had to go to the same  
route as who was there when Mala -- was Mala, 
who me  she slapped, for permission -- he had to 
sign that go to place, and so on. But again, I di
dn™t place back. [indecipherable] I knew when I 
was Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was hi s 
office. So I used to go to him, I said, Herr -- it 
was the Arbeitsfuehrer, something like that, pl ease
 sign me , sign me  this. And he used -- used to 
smile, so -- he didn™t look at me , only smiled, a
nd signed, didn™t say anything. And I sent to the -

- to the sewing room, se wing, because there we
 were exchange for young -- for older people 
fr om Auschwitz. But the -- here wa
s older people, so ma inly older people came. So sent them 
there, or I kept them longer or so -- so we ha
d to be in [indecipherable] ma ybe he didn™t know, 

ma ybe he s miled only like, I don™t know, I never 
ask him why he smiles, I didn™t care, he sign. 
So we had to be in connection with this 
-- this Arbeitskomma ndant. We  had to go to the 

Schreibstuber, and the Zaehlappell ha
d to be correct, yes, so that was -- now, and beside that, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
137 
 
 
help, from -- we order, and so food came, too. S
liced bread to -- and the 
portions of soup -- the 
stoup beans the -- the stew beans, they gave them
 food, but bread to prepare every evening again, 
so I would work around, there were ma ny peopl
e in there. I don™t know how many hundreds of 
people sometimes in a block. 
Q: Right. So you now know that those reports th
at you were doing was -- were going to Tsipi? 
A: Now I know. 

Q: Now you know, you didn™t know that. 

A: I didn™t know that. I didn™t know that.  

Q: She was ma king reports to go to Berlin of
 what was happening 
in the women™s camp. 
A: Yeah, yes. I didn™t know it was -- 

Q: You didn™t know, right. 

A: -- tso -- Tsipi. I didn™t give it exactly to her, 
she said, that came  to me , t hey gave it to me . 
Q: Right. 
A: Isn™t that interesting, we were 
in the same  room -- in the same  barrack, yes, she was in a little 
room, about a -- elite -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- yes, among the elite, and I was a little lower 
in the same barrack I were when I went as a 
Schreiberin ma de -- this my notes 
and I sent there, I give it there,
 and they gave it to her from -- 
is interesting, no?  And now we me e t .  

Q: That™s very interesting. 

A: With a phone call -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and I recognize her only by my me mory just -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
138 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and she knew also my na me , and -- 

Q: Yes, she actually introduced us. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Is interesting? 

Q: Yes, I think it™s ve ry interesting. 

A: Very interesting. 

Q: I don™t know when this happened, but at some  point you said that an SS ma n visited the 

blockalteste™s room drunk, and was asking -- 

A: Yeah. Yes, yes. Let me  tell you this story. 

Q: Why did he -- yes, can you -- was this in block four? 

A: Block four?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q: No, this was anothe
r block, this was -- 
A: That was when we left -- when we left A barr
ack, the A lager, and we left A lager when I said 
that we s -- we were there -- left
 -- we were there, only few girl
s yes, and I was scared, but we™ll 
have [indecipherable] to die, I was scared -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and so on, and so what will. So one day cam
e an SS, and he took us to a other lager, to 

another lager, only by foot, it was close, yeah. A
nd I came to this blockalteste, who saw me  that 
evening that I took some body from this road that
 was outside there, standing, here they were 
standing, and then -- but that™s interesting, that 
this girl became a woma n, and she committed in 
Israel suicide. Whom I took 
from the sauna, you know it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
139 
 
 
Q: Yes, that one you took from the sauna? 
A:  Whi c h I -- t he -- t he ot her -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- Schreiberin erased her name , and so 
I took her from the sauna, she went to her 
[indecipherable] and I took her to the other 
one. She came to New York, she divorced her 
husband, left her son with her husband, went to 
-- to Israel, ma rried again, and then she 
committed the suicide. Destiny, yeah. So the question was, this drunk SS. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. So from there we went to the other 
and this blockalteste who saw me  to steal her 
[indecipherable] I came there, and she said that 
she wanted a -- I wrote it there -- some body as a 

Polish, a Polish woma n, as a Schreiberin, but the other one, who worked with Katya 

[indecipherable] means mi ss, mi sses, yeah. Sh
e told me , the blockalte -- probably not 
[indecipherable] that I have to 
take -- she didn™t know me , I didn™
t know her, we saw each other 
only this evening, yeah. She said that Aliska has 
to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was 
good to -- to save the Polish wome n, you know, from th
e Visla that she sent 
to the latrine, go to 
the latrine, then she™s got to be Schr eiberin he
re. So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was 
the a-assist ant blockaltest e a Polish woma n, a ot
her one, they were sitting together, two Polish 
wome n. And I was with them, the Sc
hreiber. It was -- I think it wa
s late -- yeah, in October we 
came there, I think ma ybe in October, could have 
been winter or -- or s
o, it was cold, I know it -- 
we didn™t have a calendar there. I didn™t know
 the date, I didn™t know the day. Sunday we knew 
because we didn™t go to work. So, open the door
 and an SS man came into [indecipherable] 
room, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assist
ant, we had a little room, yeah. So we were 

sitting that time there, and this drunk SS ca me  in, 
took off his hat, put on a chair and said -- put -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
140 
 
 
took off the gun, put on the chair and sit there and sa
id, I will stay here with you, and I will -- I 
will sleep here on the floor with you, or I will
 go into the barrack and I will sleep on the bunk, 
the bunk [indecipherable]. I don™t leave from here, 
I will st ay with you here. An SS. And this 
other -- the -- the assist ant -- the assistant bl ockalt
este, she was so strict to him, she started to spit 
on his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he
 wa s very, very drunk, and he said, I don™t want 
to live. And there -- ther
efore, I don™t want to go from here, I 
-- therefore, I want to stay here, 
because I am not worthwhile to live. I killed so
 ma ny girls from Holland, Dutch girls. They were 
so beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, a
nd I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw 
and I killed them, and they were so beautiful, an
d therefore I don™t want 
to live. Now we were 
scared. A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spit
ting on his head. That wa
s tragic, yeah?  So it -- 
what to do?  So I didn™t say anythi
ng, and I left. I left them, and I 
went at the end of the lager was 
a office for the SS me n. They stayed always there,
 I saw them to go into there, yeah. Ne ver had 
anything to do with them. I saw them there. So I went
 into that office, to the SS office, and I said, 
we have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he 
has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of 
his -- could you please come to pick
 him up?  I didn™t say what he said, only that. And one of -- I 
don™t know, there were two or three 
there, I don™t reme mber. Maybe I didn™t notice, even. So he 
got up and he followed me  again, came into our lit
tle room, took him, didn™t say anything -- he 
was scared when he saw hi m. He
 took him, and -- he took him.  
Q: Right. 
A: And that was.  

Q: And he took the gun as well? 

A: The gun as well. This SS had 
also. Wa s dangerous, dangerous. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
141 
 
 
Q: Dangerous, but -- but interesting that -- that an
y of them would have that response, and come  
to you. 
A: Yes. N -- to me  accidentally to -- 

Q: I mean, no, no, I know that, but comi ng to the prisoners -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- to the haftlings -- 

A: Yes, that™s right, yes. His conscience [indecipherable] 

Q: Yes. It™s almost as if you could give hi
m forgi veness, or being with you could -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- save him in some  -- 

A: Yes, conscience. It -- why did I do it. 

Q: Did you ever see him again? 

A: Nah, no. 
Q: No. 
A: I wouldn™t recognize 
him. One SS, other SS. 
Q: Yeah, they™re all the --  

A: The same . 

Q: They™re all the same. 

A: No. 

Q: Does this -- did this happen before the October -- 

A: Evacuation. 

Q: It ha -- before the evacuation, but before th

d the blowing up of the 
crematorium?  October 1944 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
142 
 
 
A: October 1944. 
Q: -- was when they blew up the crematorium.  

A: No, no, no, that was after October. 

Q: It was after that? 

A: After October, because  -- 

Q: Do you reme mber the -- 

A: -- yes? 

Q: Excuse me , go ahea d. 

A: [indecipherable] forget. 

Q: I interrupted you, go ahead. 

A: October -- it was in October 1944?  You see,
 I don™t know. I know that 
I was in the lager, 
yeah, Octobe r 1944, which means I wasn™t more Laeu
ferin, because I was til the end of June. It 
means I was  -- October 1944?  Yeah, before we left, 
before -- ma ybe it was before I left -- before 
we left a -- A lager -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- which was -- that  was sometimes in the fall. A
nd I said that in October, probably we left A 

lager. So suddenly I saw -- we saw people 
running, running and with
 the running, running, 
running, and [indecipherable] was it 
blowed up?  Probably yes. Running from there, from -- from 
[indecipherable] where the crematorium, people 
were running and now I really don™t reme mber. 
I couldn™t -- I cannot state that
 I saw to you the dynamite to 
blow up the crematorium, but 
probably yes. But I remember for sure what I ca
n picture how people run away. And that was the 
Sonderkomma ndo. Not Sonderkomma ndo they [indeciphe
rable] so -- and that was -- then was a 
rumor that it was a boxer -- boxer, a boxer, a French boxer? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
143 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Among t he Sonderkommando, and he said -- he sa
id it to the SS, that they are planning to 
blow up the crematorium. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And so they discovered it, and they ran. Wa s 
funny to see that some body started to run in the 
lager, you know, the la -- lage
r to run, we couldn™t understand, I 
was -- I think, I™m not sure, I 
cannot state it again, but I think th
at one disappeared, I think so, 
but I am not sure. Did you have 
some information like that? 

Q: Wh- Wha t do mean, one disappeared, a person? 

A: From the  Sonderkomma ndo men -- 

Q: I don™t know. 

A: -- I don™t know. I -- I am not sure. 

Q: Right, you™re not sure -- 
A: I am not sure. 
Q: -- you don™t know. 

A: I don™t -- I cannot state it, be
cause I don™t know and now I know only that, that I saw them to 
run. It was during the daylight.

A: I don™t -- don™t remember. 

Q: But had you heard about that before it 
happened, or as a rumor, or only after? 
A: Only after. 

Q: Only after. 

A: I think they -- they used it for a breach some
where in -- in [indeciphera
ble] or some where like 
that. 

Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm. 
A: Think so. Because that happened they -- that 
wa sn™t in Birkenau, that happen in Auschwitz, 
they [indecipherable] some body in Auschwitz 
[indecipherable] any ot
her lager. So -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah. I cannot say. 

Q: Do you reme mber when you left Birkenau
 before you actually were evacuated? Did you 
evacuate and go back to Auschwitz one?  Or di
d you leave from Birkenau and start the Death 
March immediately? 

A: We  started the Death March. 

Q: Right away?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469

Q: But how would people get cigarettes, they w

wome n get cigarettes do you think? 
A: Yes, they would bargain. They were 
so -- let™s see, where I worked, okay? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So we -- we took some stockings or some
thing and -- and the German women, they had 
cigarettes. So they gave bread or ci
garettes for some thing, for clothing. 
Q: So you had access in that barra
ck to things, because you coul
d walk around and you also were 
able to do that, whereas most wo
me n couldn't do that in the camp. 
A: What, to smoke?  

Q: No, you had access to be able

A: So to her. But once happened that -- t
oo ma ny things -- that her doorma n -- doorma n -- 
doorlady, she let me  in. And where do you go?  I sa

And I got such a cramp in my fingers and I was 
so nervous [indecipherable] that they -- she send 
me  a way like -- like a beggar, no
? It was really [indecipherabl e]
 and I never went there. But 
other times -- I took also something, and I placed
 it in the strozak --strozak, and I was happy 

when some body stole it. It™s true. 

Q: Really? 
A: I-I-I-I couldn™t. Couldn™t.
 No, it doesn™t -- the [indeci
pherable] happened that good 
Scharfuehrer, the shu -- good comma
nder, the good one. We  went, and we used to steal there. 
And I worked in the front and I pu

hoes, I had big shoes, not these 
lace -- these lace, you know the shoes. Some
body gave it to me . And he went through 
everybody, he ask, and so on, so on. And when he cam

don™t know if he saw me  to steal, and he sai
d, Zagmuzi, tell me, how ma ny pairs of -- of 
stockings do you have in your shoes? And I looke
d at him, I didn™t know what to say. Suddenly, 
I said none. He said go. I was sure that he saw me 
to put, yes. But he was so nice. He knew that I 
am s -- that I am lying.

someti mes I sold, I don™t know, I don™t remember . I 
know that was my [indecipherable] to bring 
it sometime, put it there and -- and I don™t know
. Was business I woul

Q: You couldn™t do that? 
A: No. There are things that -- star

Q: It wasn™t that -- 

A: Like you said, our interests, 
they shrank, they shrank, bread.  
Q: That -- that became the biggest . 

A: Biggest thing bread. Or to have the th
ick part of the soup when they served. 
Q: On the bottom.  

A: Bottom. That became the big thing. 

Q: Did you talk about food together? Did --

people didn™t -- 
A: They liked --  

Q: They liked -- 

A: -- they liked to cook, and they liked to
 eat, and they were
 not so long there. 
Q: That™s what I was going to
 say, they weren™t so long. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
149 
 
 
A: They were not so long there. They came in May, started going May ™44.

Q: You were hit that day. 
A: I was hit that day. 

Q: Is that -- was that th
e only time that you remember? 
A: Once in this -- in this work where we were 
sorting clothing, yes. We  ha d to [indecipherable] 
after commn -- one if this part 
of this group. Had to write her na
me  and to put into the bundle, 
yes, into the bundle. So I was responsible for 
one group like this. And onc
e the kapo called me , 
kapo [indecipherable] prisoner kapo, and there 
was the Scharfuehrer, the commandant, the SS, 
and she -- and one of those showed me  my na me
, my na me  on a paper in a bundle of ma n coats -
- cold ma n coats, winter coats. And these -- th
ere in this bundle was a coat which was muddy, 

just muddy. And he said, why did you put this -- your
 name  -- the SS, why did you put this in -- 
your name  in this bundle and it™s dirty, you didn™t
 clean it. I said, I never worked with -- with 
men coats, I never worked there. I worked ther
e in the fr ont with the 
linen, bed linen. I never 
worked there and I -- and she slapped me , this
 kapo slapped me  once, twice. He didn™t say 
anything, he asked only. And I still sa id I didn™t, and was never he --
 and that was all, so twice, 
she was slapping me , and she was slapping me  for about -- oh, for -- 

Q: Really hard. 

A: Really hard, because she stated was my na me , 
that means my responsibility. Wa s easy to -- to 
get slapping. [indecipherable] 

Q: What did that -- what did 
that -- did that do some thing to you as a human being, to be 
s l a ppe d?  I t  mus t
 have been -- 
A: Yeah, humiliation for sure.  

Q: Yes. 

A: How come ? [i ndecipherable] I sa id no and it is
, and I di dn™t say anything else. Humiliation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
151 
 
 
Q: Right. Okay. 
A: It wasn™t more, no. 

Q: When some one says the word Auschwitz to y
ou, what™s the first thing that come s to mi nd? 
A: I don™t like to hear about it. 

Q: You don™t like to hear about it. 

A: No, no, whey they talk about it at home , or
 some body, I s a y, please stop it. No, I don™t like 
that. Or very rarely I 
will say some thing, you know. 
Q: So do you -- do you have a lot of friends w
ho were from Auschwitz, a lot of people you 
know, or you -- you don™t? 

A: No, no. 

Q: And so that you don™t -- ove
r the years you haven™t talked
 about this very much?  
A: Not too much, but I meet people which they were 
ther e, or they --  they
 lost their fa milies and 
so they were yes. No I -- I w
ould say the contrary. When Jewish
 people meet, they come always 
to this the end. They always end up with this
 lagers, with whom they lost and so forth. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. The -- they me ntion, reme mber him, him, 
hi m, my friend, this, this. So mos t  of the time 
they end -- or we end up with Auschwitz, or wi
th -- with lagers, you kno
w, I cannot. And my onk 
-- others which I me t here, which I know here, 
new friends, or n-new ac
quaintances, I don™t talk, 
I don™t bring up this thing.  

Q: Right. 

A: But most of the time, or almost always, when
 people which --which they were friends before 
we had -- which had the same  friends and so -- so 
they end up or we end up to talk about it. No, 
it™s a -- something what we never mi ss when we 
are among our people which they grew up in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
152 
 
 
same  city as it. We  have a friend with my 
husband, we are every Sunday together, besides the 
other one who doesn™t know, but he is so
me how a little bit mixi
ng up ma ybe. He said 
[indecipherable] why do you go to -- to Wa shington?
 He said, oh they called her from museum. 
And then I started to talk about some thing else. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. But when it is some body fr om our gr
oup whom we knew, we almost always end up 

about Auschwitz. And my thinking, my feeling is sa
dness, almost, or very often about the lager. 
Q: Do you dream about it? 

A: I don™t dream directly that I am in lager,
 but I dream often that I am lost. I go -- I go 
some where, the place where I don™t know, a
nd I™m barefoot and I don™t have money, I don™t 
have anything, I™m -- I™m only dressed up some ho
w and I™m lost, I lost everybody, I lost my 
husband, my  -- my son. Nobody™s there and I™m by 
myself. Always I -- I go somewhere and I 
don™t know where. Yeah, some thing 
like -- I think something [indeci
pherable]. With my fa mily I 
don™t dream so often. I was in Auschwitz, I used to
 dream with my brother. I knew, now I will go 
to bed and I will dream the same. Was still alive 
that time [i ndecipherable] thinking about it, and 
you have no idea. That was my life, that I am wi th my brother. 

Q: With your brother. 

A: Yeah, my life. My real life
 [indecipherable], yes. But I imagine. When I wake up, I have to 
get up because my thinking come s [indecipherabl e] 
so I get up, stand up and I should finish. And 
I go out to the kitchen cooking [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. Okay.

Beginning Ta pe 10 
Q: -- ing about your brother in Auschwitz, or dreami ng -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- as if you were dreami ng with him?  Is this what you were saying
?  Explain that to me . 
A: I was dreami ng that he is there. 

Q: That™s he™s there. 

A: That he™s there. 

Q: Ah, you™re having dreams with your brother in it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. So when -- did you find out in Auschwit
z what had happened to your brother and your 
mother and father, or  was it after? 

A: No, in Auschwitz -- in Auschwitz, I found 
out that they left  -- 
that they left -- 
Q: That they left. 
A: -- my fa mily left.  
Q: Yes. 

A: Nothing more, that they left . But when I return
ed, then I me t in a train, one of his friends or -- 
or acquaintances who was in the sa
me  lager. And he told me  in th
e train, I was with your brother, 
I worked with him in the forest, and he run away 
when he heard that they take the parent of the 
people to help them. He said, and then I stayed th
ere, I went again to work there, and some how I 
me t partisans and the partisans t
ook me  with him -- with them, a
nd so I was saved. Was a s maller 
lager ne -- next to Lublin. And that -- that he wa
s hidden. I think that he sa
id that he knew from 
him, or the lady where he worked, but I don™t kn
ow who told me  that he was hidden, and he 
came home  when he heard that they took hi -- bu
t he told me  this story and it™s a true story. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
154 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: That he was -- he worked with him in the forest. 

Q: So twice your brot
her left a place -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- where he mi ght have been saved. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Once when he was hidden and he went to your 
parents to help them when they were being 

deported, and then the second time he left the fo
rest to be with them. Do you know where they 
were sent?  

A: I don™t know, but I imagine that to Auschwitz. 

Q: You think to Auschwitz? 

A: Because this -- the small lager they 
sent people to Auschwitz, I think so. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Maybe I was -- I wasn™t standing there, b
ecause it was ™42, and I came through there -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- ™43. Probably not [indecipherable] before. 

Q: So, you go on the Death March, and you obviously
 see there are a new set of guards now, 
right? These are not the guards you know. 

A: We hr macht, We hr macht, not SS -- 

Q: We hr macht, uh-huh. 

A: Wehr macht. 

Q: Really. So these are all strangers? 

A: I saw We hrmacht. Strangers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
155 
 
 
Q: And there™s a lot of shooting, isn™t there? 
A: Yes, at the beginning -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- a lot of shooting. I was al -- almost alwa
ys among the m, because I wasn™t enough strong to 
march. I had to lean on some
body. We were four girls.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: For me it was the mo st diffi cult part. 

Q: Really? 

A: I couldn™t -- so they pulled me  in. 

Q: And so they pulled you. 

A: Pulled me. 

Q: In some  way like you 
pulled Dieter out of -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- quarantine 25 -- 
A: Yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: -- they kept you going, yes? 

A: Yeah. It was there -- Wehr macht -- We
hr macht. Not everybody was bad, not everybody. I 
couldn™t say that everybody was bad. 
And when they -- it was a order 
to -- to -- to rest. And -- 
rest [indecipherable] and hi -- I ha
d a -- a raincoat, a raincoat, a tin 
raincoat and it was very cold, 
18
th
 of January, and my shoes with laces, but they were narrow, they were not enough big. After 
the war I had an operation, a bunion operation, both
 of them, because they became so big my -- 
see this line here? 

Q: Right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
156 
 
 
A: And -- 
Q: You had big bunions from those shoes. 

A: I think so. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And frozen, too. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I couldn't ma rch. My hip. So when they said
 [indecipherable] I was lying -- I always lied 
down in this -- my raincoat in th
e snow, others also, but I always
, see?  And this SS, he was, I 
know from where, he was from Düs seldorf, Dooler
, what Dooler?  It will co
me to my name -- my 
me mory, Wi llie Dooler fr om Düsseldorf, and -- a 
Wehr macht, and he said get up, get up. I said 
no, I am so tired. He said, you will get a cold. I sa
id, I don™t care. I really 
di dn™t care, I so tired. 
[indecipherable] get up, get up, because when you w
ill stay in the back they will shoot you. So 
some how I ma naged. And so he was really often 
beside or behind us and he said go, go, go, go, 
so we went. He found us  all the place to sleep, becau
se some  of them, or mo
st of them, they slept 
in a barn, and he™s -- he found us a place to 
sleep in a house. Was a woman there, a Polish 
woma n. He asked her to cook -- prepare us suppe
r. She made us potatoes and ham -- and ham?  
Ha m, yeah, potatoes and ham. And a fter so
 ma ny years, we --we slept in a bed. 
Q: On the Death March? 
A: On the Death March, during the night. The other 
was in a barn. And I told him I want -- he -- 
I loved his approach yes, I saw that he™s so earnest. I said, I wa nt to stay here, I want to hide. He 

said, if you want to, hide , but you take a risk be
cause could ha ppen that the Germans will -- will 

burn the village and you will burn with them. If 
you want I will give  you br ead. You can stay, 
but rather go on. It™s a risk to
 stay. So we went on and on, like him -- with him. And between 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
157 
 
 
there -- between this time, they 
-- they were shooting people [ind
ecipherable] the most sad part 
which I saw was when I saw a woma n lying and 
a ho -- a brain next to her. They shoot her 
through the brain. And then a othe
r one when -- a woman, she was 
Italian, not Jewish, she was 
pregnant, and she was in my block where I wasSc hreiberin so she noticed me  from s o me where 
on a higher spot, she was standing with some body. And it ma de -- she ma de a impression that 

she is giving birth. A big stomach and so -- fell
ing down and looking at me
 [indecipherable] but I 
couldn™t -- first of all, I couldn™t go out and I wo
uldn™t risk that I couldn™
t do, and then I couldn™t 
walk myself. It was very sad, this ma rching. I had 
these tied shoes, and even
 th-that time were -- 
were not pantyhoses, only stockings
, reme mber, and girdles, yes? 
Q: Yes. 

A: And my girdle went into my flesh, so this
 was bleeding, and in -- in my flesh there. The 
girdle, and my shoes were tied, my -- 
my raincoat was cold. So we went. 
Q: And this was miles -- 
A: Hm?  
Q: -- that you walked. 

A: I walked. Miles. 

Q: Miles and miles and miles in
 very cold January weather. 

A: Wa s very cold [indecipherable] 

Q: Did you have gloves this time? 

A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I don™t reme mber. It was so 
difficult that some  people ma naged to have some  bread in the 
rucksacks. We had some ma terial, we could -- 
we ma de ourselves some rucksacks, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
158 
 
 
threw on the -- on the road, see loaves of bread. B
ecause before, the da y when we left for this 
ma rch, some body opened the storages, the bread storag
es and they were stealing bread, so some  
of them, but th-throwing everything, even -- 
even a little clothing, whatever some body had, 
thrown. Everything was too heavy, was very bad. 
Q: Yes. So how ma ny da y -- do you have any idea
 how many days you marched til you got to the 
train that took you to Ravensbrück? 

A: Yes, I think that only two 
days because I reme mber two night
s that we slept on the way, two 
nights, yes. 

Q: Did you sleep two -- two nights in some  -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: So this man arranged on the second [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, he arranged the first day, and then th
e second day he arranged in a house where on the 

first floor we re sleeping SS -- not SS, soldiers, 
probably We hrmacht, they were sleeping there. 
And we were upstairs, and he was so nice. We  we
re two Jewish girls and 
two Christians. One of 
-- probably was Jewish and she said 
that she is Christian because pe
ople said that she is Jewish, 
so I don™t know, but re-regularly were two and tw
o. And he was so nice that he said to the two 
Christian girls, Polish girls, to te
ll us we shouldn™t say that we are 
Jewish in front of the soldiers 
or the people because that would be bad for 
us. We -- we wouldn™t say anyhow, yeah. Yeah, he 

helped us. 

Q: We re there people in the Polish populat
ion that saw you as 
you were ma rching?   
A: Yes. 

Q: Wi  -- di -- did people say a
nything, did anybody give you anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
159 
 
 
A: Yes. It was -- I wrote about
 it. In one village, I don™t know
 -- I don™t -- didn™t know the 
villages, I didn't know the times. There were a 
few wome n st anding with 
buckets full of water 
and with little containers and they -- they passe
d on. I was on the other side, I didn™t get a water, 
but on this side, they -- standing, I don™t 
know, maybe 10 - 12 wome n, Pol i sh wome n. 
Q: Standing there. 

A: And they hand over water, yes, it was very touchy. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, it was waiting -- 

Q: And the Germans di dn™t stop them?  

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. Maybe -- ma ybe they were between -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- them. And I don™t reme mber even it wa
s first day or second day, I don™t reme mber. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Probably first day beca
use we were rushing, and so they could help --  
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- they helped with wa ter, a
nd that was a big thing, a big thing. 
Q: It must have been important 
as a huma n being to see it, yes? 

A: Very important, very important, even I didn™t 
get the water, was very important to see that 
some  people are nice, and they were not scar
ed of the Germa ns, they gave us water. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: See that means water, when you don™t have it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
160 
 
 
Q: Yes, it may be more important than food in some  ways. 
A: Yeah, more important for sure, yeah. 

Q: So do you get on a train to go to Ravensbrück? 

A: Yes, on a train. 

Q: Is it an open --  

A: Open -- open. 

Q: So you™re still freezing? 

A: Yeah. Mm-hm, and in the meantime the men we
re there already, and pr
obably they were the 

whole night there on the station, 
because they threw them ou-out, off the trains, frozen, like 
pieces of -- of wood. They
 take a pi ece of wood -- 
Q: And throw it out?  [indecipherable] 

A: Th -- they were only in a -- in -- in the uni
forms, thin, from cotton 
probably, and a little cap. 
Q: And that™s it. 
A: No glove, nothing else, no, no. 
Q: So a lot of them died? They just threw them -- 

A: They threw them down -- 

Q: -- like they were twigs. 

A: -- threw them down, s kinny, yes. Musselmens.  

Q: So were the wome n in better shape than that -- than the me n? 

A: That time I think that they were -- 

Q: So -- 

A: -- because I didn™t see anybody, only what -- 
who was shot, but I didn™t see anybody through 
-- through them, because we came and we entered the -- the train, the open wagon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
161 
 
 
Q: Yeah. Right. 
A: But they were there pr  -- they were there when we arrive d -- 

Q: [indecipherable] yes. 

A: -- so I had that impression th
at -- and some body said also, am
ong the me n that they are very 
long here, I don™t know for how -- how ma ny hours 
or the whole night, or so. And they got 
frozen there on the train, on the trai
n station they got frozen because they arrive d there, so they 
were there. But they couldn™t ma ke it. After we 
left, we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin, was 

bombed that time. And the wome n said that 
they don™t know about Auschwitz. Girls ask, do you 

know about a place, Auschwitz, where they burn pe
ople?  No. But then they took us to different 

places, train stopped, and we went 
further, furthe r, because it was no place. Everythi ng was 
evacuating from -- from pop -- from Poland. So we 
went, went til we came  to Ravensbrück, and 
there started the other mi sery.  

Q: It was really bad there. 
A: Bad because no food, only the second day or
 third day some  food, but we didn™t have 
containers. Only our friend Vera
 Kubario, she had some  [indeciphe
rable] containers she brought, 
and she gave  us sips to take, we counted the

five. And once she hit me, because I -- now, she 
was nice, because I took small sips. Said, you 
will be hungry. Take bigger sips. 
Q: Bigger sips. 

A: Yeah, that was [indecipherable]. We didn™t have
 place where to sl eep, it was a bi g place. We 
sit down, we didn™t have even to -- to sit where.
 Le gs one on the other one and so were very bad. 
And they didn™t let us in to drink water, the ol

Q: The progress of the wa r. 

A: No. We  didn™t know -- 

Q: You hear nothing? 

A: Nothing. 

Q: So you have no idea? 

A: No, we knew only when it was an attent at on Hitler, that  we heard. We  didn™t know anything. 

Q: But you didn™t know anything, you didn™t know th
at the -- the Russians were comi ng this way

A: No, no.

A: No. We  -- when we evacuated, then, these s

Dooler, he brought me  a ma p, he brought me  a 
map, and ma rked with red that look here, the 
Russians are here, here, here, they are afte

[indecipherable] I heard from hi m where are the 
Russians. But the Russians, they stopped there 
in -- before Auschwitz, they stop. 

Q: Right. 

A: They didn™t continue, so -- no, we didn't know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
163 
 
 
Q: And they continued 
later, after you left . 
A: And they continued later. 
Q: Yes. 

A: But we didn't know anything. It was a tim
e during summertime in ™44, because I was 
Laeuferin I reme mber, that in summe r  -- at 11 o™clock in summe r, every day, I -- we knew that™s 

el -- eleven, I don™t know fr
om where, so there were airplane

lager and leaving 
this --  this lines -- there lines, so we were
 so happy that they ar
e but it pass by and it is. 
Some times happened that the SS, they run so
me where to hide. But they ran and los -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- we didn™t know nothing, no. Was so hopeless. 

Q: So did it become mor e and 
more hopeless?  [indecipherable] 
A: No, and then came the ma rch. 

Q: Right. 
A: Wa s diffi cult, so was ho -- wa
s no hope that we  survive -- 
Q: Really. 
A: -- from t his ma rch. Then when we came to 
a other lager, there wa
s good, where was ha --  
Q: Redshof. 

A: Redshof. That was he -- 

Q: That was okay? 

A: Oh, that was heaven. But it was so long that 
was afraid that I will lo
se my mi nd. There were 
some  girls which they started to be craz
y, yelling and so. They
 couldn™t take it. 
Q: Because it was to -- cause it was  

A: Too much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
164 
 
 
Q: -- was never going to end. 
A: Yeah. I don™t know if their for s
o, but they -- mentally, they came. 
Q: So you were in Redshof February, March, Apr
il, or January, February? You ca me  in January 
to Redshof? 

A: January, March, the end of January. 

Q: End of January. 

A: Yes, so January is February, March, through 29
th
 of April, then we left . 
Q: And you were evacuated again? 

A: For one day only, to go to -- bu
t the whole world was evacuating. 
Q: Yes. 

A: All -- 

Q: Everybody was [indecipherable] 

A: Everybody, everybody was evacuating. 
Q: Did you feel that you were ge
tting closer to being free? 
A: Yes, yes, that™s -- 
Q: You did? 

A: Yeah, that time, yes. We were from -- we le
ft from Redshof, and we saw the Germans they 
evacuating, and the soldiers to run, 
everybody was running. Everybody was running.  
Q: All right, let me  ask you one question a
bout Redshof. When you were in Redshof, did you 
think you were going to start going off 
your mi nd too, because you were -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: Even though it was better physically. 

A: It was very good -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
165 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- very good. But I was afraid that I am ge
tting out of my mi nd. I couldn™t take it more. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Wa s too long. I used to go out and watch the -- what? 

Q: The stars? 

A: The stars, yes. I am [i ndecipherable]. I 
watch the stars, was looking. Maybe some where 
some body™s looking at the same  star I am looki
ng. That was my therapy. I had to find some  
bridge, some  space to be long, yeah. It was too 
much, you know, it™s too much. And that™s all. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But then we went and we saw ever
ybody™s evacuating, we knew that™s the end.  
Q: Right. 

A: But I mu st again [indecipherable] to ma rc
h home, but we were free, we were free. 
Q: But it doesn™t end easily, it™s not as 
if you™re liberated an
d everything™s fine 
A: No. 

Q: All of Europe is devastated -- 

A: No, whe n you come  ho -- 

Q: -- and families are gone fr om -- 

A: Fa milies are gone, you are alone
, and you are not the same  as th
e ot her ones who are fr -- who 
were free, you are not the same . You don™t understa
nd each other. The values are different. They 
talk about different things. They are interested ab
out different things. It™s not the same . And to fit 
in into the free world is not so easy. We 
are not the same. Not the same, because -- 
Q: Can you explain that more?  Wh
at were people talking about 
that you were not talking -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
166 
 
 
A: It™s not in t -- because it is
 not interesting to us, but [i
ndecipherable] for important. Not 
interesting for us, no. They will -- 
we will try, let™s see, 
let™s see, now I make
 it up. Let™s see they 
will dress up, or -- or  they will [indecipherabl e]
 so me thing expensive, or I don™t know. So it™s 
not interesting. We ™re alive, so we have to surv
ive and it™s not -- and they don™t take you as -- as 
the same . They take -- they think that you are diffe
rent, yeah. They take all -- by myself I feel I 
am different from the m now, yeah. 
Q: And did people ask you wh
at happened?  Did they care? 
A: Once we went to -- to a city. I me t peopl
e on the -- on the way and so and so. We  went 
through a city, that city was cal
led [indecipherable] and one ma n from Pr eıov, I s-saw hi m on the 
street because I had the business on the same  street
 [indecipherable] from me . But I talked to him 
and we went -- I kept with them, with him and 
with two fr iend -- two fr
iends?  Yeah, and with 
two friends. They went three mile and I was w
ith them. And he took us to a house, to his 
relatives, to his relatives in [i
ndecipherable]. And they gave me  a room, and they had the other 
room. They were nice, they gave me  a -- some th
ing -- some thing to wash up and so. And I heard 
how the woma n, Jewish -- Jewish couple, older 
couple, a woma n said to the ma n, did you hear 
what these girls said? They said 
[indecipherable] or they will be 
-- and he said, you don™t have to 
-- to listen and to -- to 
-- to -- to -- listen to
 -- to believe her everything. You don™t have to 
believe her everything, what he said. And then I 
decided I don™t want to 
talk more about what 
happened there. That was very pain
ful. I come  to a first house -- 
Q: And they don™t believe you. 

A: They don™t believe me , no.  

Q: So, did you stop talking? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
167 
 
 
A: Not totally, but I didn™t say 
that I wasn™t no -- nowhere or 
so, but I didn™t explain, I didn™t 
explain. Maybe to my uncle, ma ybe like that. He -- 
he lost also ev -- some  [indecipherable] yeah. 
No, I -- and since then I someti mes mention it fo
r among pe ople. I don™t want to talk about it 
because that time, right away, on the way, he 
said to her, you don™t have to believe  her 
everything what she says. No.  

Q: You went back to Pr eıov, we talked about 
that in the beginning. And then you went to your 
uncle in Humenné. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. And you me t your husband. 

A: Yes. 

Q: You me t the person who became your husband, if you will. 

A: Yeah he came -- became  his boss. 

Q: Yes. Wh y did the two of you decide to st ay 
in Slovakia, or was there no choice, until ™68?  
A: Yeah. It™s a reasonable que
stion. Life was good there. After the war, people were happy. They 

were not -- we were also to danc
ing, so still, if also [i ndecipher
able] different who was there, not 
everybody was there, because not everybody returned, yes? 

Q: Right. 

A: But those who were there, they wanted enj
oy life. So life was joyf
ul and even the economy 
was good, because nothing was there more, so wh
en some body started business or  so, so he 
ma de -- he was doing well, or -- or he got a job, 
or so. Nothing was there, everything was like a 
vacuum in Slovakia. People were mi ssing, so ev
erything had to be built
 again, so economy was 
good.  

Q: Wo w. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
168 
 
 
A: And it was also music, and it was -- here and there some body returned, so they were happy, 
so they used to say, oh here will be better than 
in America, so I will st ay here, yeah. But then 
slowly, slowly we realized that it™s not the sa me  
life than it was, because 
first of all, we mi ssed 
our fa milies. 

Q: I was going to say, it must -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- must have been very difficult to be there. 

A: Yes, it was, it was. Well, it™s --  I married. I ha
d the home, yes. I -- I wasn™t -- I didn™t have to 
be hungry. Was a reasonal -- 

Q: Right. 

A: Now, I liked him. We didn™t go out, no -- no
thing. He was a [indecipherable] and I was a -- 
and suddenly -- I was engaged to some body. And so
me body -- suddenly he asked me  if I want to 
ma rry hi m, I said yes. But beside that, yes, 
beside that he was a -- 
was a nice boy, quiet boy and 
so, but I was happy that I have a home, yes, ha
ve a home, and I have some body, some body close. 
I needed some body to talk. Some body who would 
under -- who would be 
willing to understand. 
Q: Right. 

A: Who will be willing to listen [i ndecipherable] so it was not reason to go out. Then later on we 

wanted to go here. My uncle left for America, 
for New York, and he wanted me  to come  with 
him, he wrote to his relatives th
ey should send me an affidavit -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but they didn™t. And -- we have to stop, huh? 

Q: No, go ahead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
169 
 
 
A: And then my husband got an affidavit from his 
uncle, from Texas or from where. But affida -- 
and then he asked for me because we  were engaged, til the affidavit came, we -- we worked on a 
passport. The numbers were very high in the St
ates, yes, registration num
ber. And til -- and he 
has his -- he had his store, his hous
e and so on, til he deci 
-- he -- til he started 
to be -- to turn to 
the Communists. So til then we asked for the pa
ssport and we send the last mi nute the pa -- the 
affidavit to the consulate, to the Ame r ican cons
ulate, and it wa s late, was late, because -- because 
why? Because the numbers were hi gh. So some how
 it didn™t work, til we de
cided that we want 
to leave. So the numbers were late, and we
 stayed. And then it was impossible to go. 
Q: Right. 

A: For years. And then we left still, to s -- we came to Ne w York in 1966. They permitted us for 

a -- for a vi sit. They believed that  we will retu
rn. But we didn™t fi nd that
 what we -- what we 
were looking for in New York. We  stayed for 
two months, and we had -- had on jobs. So we 
didn™t have to -- where to sleep, we slept once he
re, once there, we have shift from pla ce to 
place, yes. So we went back. 
And then we started again -- 

Q: Again, right. 

A: -- and we came there, then we returned. 

Q: [indecipherable] to stop, yes? 

A: Yeah. 
End of Tape 10 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
170 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe 11 
Q: Is it Alice or Alicia, wh
ich is -- which do you like? 
A: Alice, Alicia -- 
Q: Ali -- Alicia --  Aliska -- 

A: Aliska. Whatever, is so ma ny 
-- whatever you want. Alice is -- 
Q: Alice is it. 

A: -- regularly, yes. 

Q: Okay. Do you have -- when you think about 
your life, do you think th
at Auschwitz changed 
you a great deal?  Or how -- how do 
you think that -- be-besides the loss, I mean that™s clear -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that the loss is tremendous and there™
s nothing -- but you as a person, do you think it 
changed you a great deal? 

A: Yes. I don™t find things so -- some  things for 
s-so important than -- than ma ny people, ye -- 
yes. I don™t find little things so very important
. Things are which -- you will leave and they will 
stay and nothing will change. No, I -- I don™t know 
how I was there at that time, because I was so 
young. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So I didn't have certain [indecipherable] for life. I didn™t have certain 
-- any [indecipherable]. 
I wanted to be well, I wa nted to be happy, and th
at™s it. So I -- I didn™t have [indecipherable] I 
want this, this, I -- my values are this or th
is. But only for now, I -- I feel some ti me s different 
from others in this aspect, th
at not everything is for me  so 
i mportant like for you here in the 
States, who didn™t go through these harsh time s.
 And ma ybe I understand
 better people. I look 
for a reasons when some body is not as I want to
. So I try to fi nd the reason why is he not, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
171 
 
 
because I believe that everybody has some r
eason for his way, how he thinks, yes. And 
everybody is right, in his way, and that perception is
 different, but is a bi
g value to you. Doesn™t 
have to be to me , or to others. And then, not ev
erybody has the strength to -- to struggle the same  
way for life, yes. You will go for -- you want 
to be , let™s see, I don™t know, ma ybe you are the 
director of the whole museum or some thing, or a mi nister of -- of welfare, or some thing. And 
somebody will not have courage, or  I will not 
ha ve  courage and you do it your way because you 
believe in your strengths and so some body doe
sn™t believe, or you believe in -- in mankind, 
some body doesn™t. You will risk your life for so
mebody, and some -- whatever. It doesn™t mean 
the other one is better or
 worse. That™s your -- your -- th
ese are your values and your beliefs. 
Who believes and values the same  thing, 
yes?  You believe in this [inaudible] 
Q: So, it -- has it in some  strange way ma de 
you more tolerant than you would have been? 

A: Yes. I think so. 

Q: That you™re easier on pe
ople, you don™t judge people? 
A: Yes, I don™t like to judge people. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I like to understand people. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And not to judge people. This the diffe
rence maybe, yeah. That
™s a good evaluation. 
Q: Do you think you were not that wa y when you were younger, before -- 

A: I say -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: -- I don™t know, because -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
172 
 
 
A: -- I was nothing. I was nothing, I -- I wanted
 to be happy, I wanted 
to be nice looking, I 
wanted to be liked. 
Q: Right. 

A: I wanted to be -- to make some thing of my
 life. But I -- I didn™t 
have -- ma ybe some how 
unconsciously I had these beliefs 
but I didn't know about it because 
I didn™t have to deal with 
real life. I went home, I have my food, I have 
my  bed, I have my -- my love from my parents, 
from my fa mily. So I didn™t -- didn™t have to spec
ulate why it™s like that
 or like that. Life was 
simple. Wa s  a [indecipherable] yeah, but I don™t 
-- didn™t have my own [i ndecipherable] and I 
have to ma ke up my own [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and that is [indecipherable] 

Q: But it™s interesting that such a br ut al pl ace as Auschwitz -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- could some how -- whether it
 brought out in you, or you simply ma de of who you were as a 
child and didn™t know it. 

A: No. 

Q: Because clearly, certain values that you had 
came  out there. You didn™t become  a brutal 
person -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- in Ausc hwitz. 

A: No. No, I didn™t. 

Q: So maybe in some funny way it didn™t cha
nge you. It changed the course of your life. 
A: Yes, could be. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
173 
 
 
Q: But ma ybe it didn™t ch
ange your character. 
A: Yes, ma ybe not, ma ybe not. 
Q: It™s interesting.  

A: I didn't try to understand people, b
ecause I didn™t have to understand them. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes. Didn™t have to evaluate them because 
I was a young girl, could I evaluate olde r people, 
for politics or  something like that, no. 

Q: Right, right. But you did realize a dream that
 you had when you were a child, and that was to 
become a teacher. 

A: Yes, I wanted to become  a teacher. 

Q: And you did. 

A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be 
a teacher. Not [indecipherable] so much to teach, 
but how to behave and didn™t succeed always, not a
ll the students were good, 
but I tried, I tried. 
Q: And wha t  did you teach?  What was the subject for which you -- 

A: My main subject was home economics. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: That is family living, that
 is what -- housing and design, th
at is nutrition and cooking and 
sewing and ma terial. That™s my -- yeah. But in Cana
da is like that, that yo
u don™t -- sorry -- that 
you don™t stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay?  You 

teach it. So I taught ma ny things. I studied ma thematics, which I am not so good in mathematics, 

I couldn™t say, but I didn™t know 
[indecipherable] taught me , and even physics one time  I had to 
teach, lot more. I taught ma ny things
, what they needed, yeah, so. 

Q: But what you were really teaching was [indecipherabl e] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
174 
 
 
A: We ll [indecipherable] that was family living, 
that means -- I studied huma n relations and 
fa mily living see, for eight years at Magill to
 -- to ma ke up my -- my -- my studies, yeah, for 
update my studies [indecipherable] what di
d I stu -- yeah, I ha
d special education 
[indecipherable] and then I had there a teacher ce
rtificate and here I ma de the [indecipherable] 
three diplomas here. But they -- everywhere 
was psychologic, everyw
here was psychologic. 
Q: Right. 
A: To understand people, that was my first thing.
 And I think I ma ster this one, to understand 
people. I try evaluate people, and 
then to understand them. That is 
my main thing in life, toward 

people. 

Q: And wha t  did you enjoy most about teaching? 

A: Mostly check. I used to say, you don™t like 
your -- your -- your day, th
ink about the check. Or 
-- or think about the -- some people 
work also in a me ntal hospital.
 But I -- I used to say really 
was -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one 
student understood me , if I changed only one 
student, then it was worthwhile ev
erything to study, to teach and so
 -- to change them, to change 
them, to -- to -- to gi ve them self confidence -- fi
rst of all self confidence
, that™s very important. 
And self reliance and -- and things 
like that to -- to help them to
 -- to make a living, to help them 
to ma ke something about themselves. But then I sa
w that, that as soon changed, he didn™t believe 
in himself. Sometimes I gave him a better mark, 
and I implanted into him that he is good. And 

sometimes it worked that he believed in himself. 
That is the most -- that was the most important 

part to me . And they should respect people and s
o, but ma inly self respect. I used to say, and you 
don™t respect yourself, nobody will re
spect you. That was [indeciphera
ble] I believe that™s the 
main thing. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
175 
 
 
A: Courage, self respect, self confidence.  
Q: Did any of the students ever
 ask you about your European pa
st and where you were?  Did they 
-- any -- any of your students ever 
know that you were in Auschwitz? 
A: No, nobody. 

Q: No, nobody. 

A: Nobody. No. 

Q: And that was a very consci
ous decision on your part -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- not to tell them. Do you think 
now ma ybe it would have been okay? 
A: I wouldn™t say. 

Q: You wouldn™t say. 

A: No, I wouldn™t sa y, because I have  to be one of them. Nothing has to be in my life which 

would differ me , which would 
ma ke me  different, yeah? 
Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: Cause they were not in Auschwitz. 
They have to deal with life how it is. 
Q: [indecipherable] is. 

A: How it is, they have to deal th
is wa y. It™s their [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: And they -- they have [indecipherable] to work
 out their life as it is [indecipherable] them up, 
no.  

Q: I would imagine you were a wonderful teacher. 

A: I was a good teacher. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
176 
 
 
A: People liked me , yea h. Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the 
other side they counted on the th
at I am soft, ma ybe, right?   
Q: Right. Yeah, well -- 

A: Oh that™s right, yes, I couldn™t say for sure 
I wa s so respected and s
o, but they liked me , and 
they trusted me, yes. 

Q: Yeah. So is there anything that we  -- I know you 
have all sorts of things in your life that we 
haven™t talked about, but there --
 is there anything important 
about your experiences during the 
Holocaust that you want to ta
lk about that we haven™t? 
A: Maybe about this lady, it™s amazing, the German
 lady whom I me t. She was lageralteste. This 
was lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageraltest e. She came, I met her, and she said that  

she was a lagerfuehrerin. In a lager she was an 
SS, and that she opened the door and she let out 
the prisoners and so she became a haftling. I me n
tioned her in my thing. And she -- and so she 
became a prisoner. Then I didn™t see -- see her 
too much. And we discussed with her -- I suppose 
I spoke to her, discussed about huma n relations
, among human feelings, a
bout beha -- humanly 
to behave. And she said, it™s ve ry easy outside
 to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and 
according to -- to -- to rules, human rules. But here
 it™s very difficult, because first of all, we 
have to think about ourselves, yes. Was difficult. So
 that outside I am very
 -- she said, outside in 
the world, people move with ma sks on their faces.
 They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that 
they care about themselves. But here you have to
 talk, you have to think about yourself. So it is 

not so difficult that here you see th
e human being as it is -- as he 
is, as he is. There it is a ma sk. 
It™s a play. Outside, the worl
d is a play, in lager --  
Q: It™s not like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0469  
177 
 
 
A: -- is the real human being. Y-You show your
self -- you present yourself as you really are. 
You don™t try to cover up yourself. However, who -- 
how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he
