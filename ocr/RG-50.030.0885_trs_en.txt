Q: And what about  your parents? What were t heir names?  

 

A:  My father™s name was 
Lizer
. 
 
Q: Lizer. 

 

A: 
Lizer
, Lazer Weiss.  And he came from 
K
nihynicze
. 
 

Q: 
Knihynicze
?  
 
A:  
Knihynicze
. 
 
Q: And what is that? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
4  
 
 
A: That was in Gal icia.  However, it has changed borders and, and rulers constant ly.  
 

Q: So when you sa y Galicia, 
Kni hynicze
, was it a shtetl?  Was it  a town? 
 
A: I think so. I thi nk it was a shtetl. 
 

Q: Did you ever go there? 

 

A: No. I™ve never found it.  I™ve never found i t on a map, but a cousi n of mine who is 

very savvy on the i nternet found it.  

 
Q: Oh really. So now at least you know where it is. 
 

A: Exactly, and the spelling, which is extraordinary.   

 

Q: The places in that part of the world can have five spellings for a smal l town, a small 

place, five different languages.  Di d your father ever speak of it? 

 
A: He did.  Not too fondly. He was very eager to get awa y from it and he served in the 
First World War and had a chance t o see the world, a lit tle more of the world. And he 

was very eager to get  away from 
Knihynicze
.  
 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
5  
 
 
Q: Can you give me a sense, now t hat you™ve found it on a map, where is 
Knihynicze
?  
Where in Galicia woul d that be? 
 

A: Toda y it™s Ukrai ne.  It has changed hands sometimes called Poland. The Germans 
called it Poland.  And so m y passport said Pol and. 
 

Q: Because you had your citizenship based on your father™s birth. 

 

A: Correct. 

 

Q:  Is it near any large cit y that you were able to place when you finall y Œ  
 
A: No but he always spoke of Krakow, which is in Poland and he, he sort of hoped that 

that was, that was a goal of his to go to Krakow. 

 

Q: That™s a beautiful cit y. 

 

A: It is, I™ve been there yes. 
 
Q:  Did your father come from a large fami ly hi mself? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
6  
 
 
A:  He was the oldest and he had quite a few sisters and brothers.  And his father was a 
carpenter who quickly brought him into t he business.  And so he learned carpentry from 

knee high up and he became a carpenter, which served hi m very well throughout his life.  

 
Q: Yes, it™s one of those t ypes of skills that is transferrable. A 
lawyer
 ma y not be able to 
be a lawyer in every country, but a carpenter, t hat™s different. 
 

A: And it gave him sort of a privileged position during the First Worl d War when his 

commanding officer recognized hi s talent and sort of kept hi m cl ose by to feather his love 

nest basically.  And so he, he made things for this--  

 
Q: Commanding officer 
 

A: Commanding officer. And stayed safe. 

 

Q:  One thing I di dn™t ask was which arm y did he serve with.  That™s also not a done deal . 

 

A: Right. It must have been the Kaiser™s arm y. 
 
Q: It would have been t he German depressi on 
arm y?
 
 

A: Correct. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
7  
 
 
 
Q: Not the Austro-Hungarian army? 

 

A:  You know, I don™t know. I don™t know. 
 
Q: Poland when it  was subdivided, well basicall y torn apart in 1795 is when it went to 

Austro-Hungary, t o Prussia and to Russia and when your father was born, he was born i n 

one of those three places.  Whether it was the Russian part-- 

 

A: I think i t was Austria, Austria.  Yes.  

 
Q: So then it probably was the Austrian arm y. 
 

A:  Army. Correct.  Yeah. He spoke German so. 

 

Q: Well both places, Prussia and Austro-Hungary. 
 

A: Well the y were on the same side. 
 
Q: What else did he tel l you about his life, as he was growing up that  sticks in your mi nd? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
8  
 
 
A:  Well they were, you know, in a small  town and the, everybody watched everybody 
else and made sure t hat  you were doing the right thing. That you were going to 
cheder
, 
you were observing the holidays. And of course it was a very kosher home.  And that™s, 

that was you know all he knew.  When his father died suddenly, he was 14 years old.   
 
Q: Oh he was very young. 

 

A: He was very young and he became the head of the house. 

 

Q: That™s a huge burden for a young boy. 

 
A: It was and he never got, he never quite got over it. I mean I thi nk t he man was a 
genius. 

 

Q: Your father. 

 

A: Yes.  And the older I get, the more I can rel ate to what he went through, but he was 

very stern. And he had all these ki ds to take care of.  And his mot her.  To take care of.  
And he did it, he did.  
 

Q: W
hat year was he born? 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
9  
 
 
A: He was born in 1892. 
 

Q: So his father would have died in 1906, something like that. And he took care of these 

kids.  He had learned the carpentry trade from his own father, during those first few years 
that he had with him.  And he served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I.  
 

A: Correct. 

 

Q: Where the carpentry kept him safe. 

 

A: Exactly.  Exactly. 
 
Q: Did you ever know any of your aunts and uncles, his brothers and sisters?  

 

A:  I, I knew two of them. There was a hard feelings in t hat family. Very, very hard 

feelings. And so there was a rift and I did not really get to know them. I know of them but 

I did not have a direct experience with them.  

 
Q:  You sa y when you know two of them, you know of two of them
, rather 
than having 
met  th em?
 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
10
 
 
 
A: I think we did meet them.  In fact one of my father™s si sters came t o meet the boat 
when we arrived.  

 

Q: Oh I see, so she had already been to the United States. She was already in America.  
 
A: Correct, yes. My grandmother™s, his, my father™s mot her, 
Ch
ia
 
Rivka
 Goldberg had a 
large extended family and some of them had emigrated to the United States.  Probably 

before the First World War.  And so there was a family on this si de of the ocean yes.  

And the y were the ones who provi ded the first visas for our family. 

 

Q: We™ll come to that.  Now what did your father tell you about his own parents, his own, 
what kind of people they were and things like t hat.  
 

A: He didn™t really talk about them too much. As I sa y, by the time he was talking to me 

there was this rift.   

 

Q: Do you know what i t was due to? 

 
A: It was a lack of appreciation for what he had done for them.  It  was a lack of 
acknowledgment and he just couldn™t get over that.  So he just t urned his back on 
them.  

It was very painful. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
11
 
 
 
 
Q: I can imagine or I can™t i magine actually. 

 

A:  Well it meant t hat you know we didn™t  have any supportive famil y around.   
 
Q: And that means in Vienna? 

 

A: No, thi s was in the United States.  In Vienna, his mot her had her own apart ment, 

which m y father supported.   

 

Q: So you knew your grandmother? 
 
A: A little bit, yeah.  Yeah.   

 

Q: Do you have any m emories of her? 

 

A:  Just that she was very tiny. Very tiny and she didn™t speak German. She spoke 

Yiddish and we didn™t have much, much contact. Yeah. 
 
Q: What about religion? Was he brought up in a very orthodox family? Or? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
12
 
 
 
A: I don™t think they were you know really committed to orthodoxy but the trappings of 
orthodoxy.  Kosher home and food and observation of major hol ida ys.  I don™t think the, 

the real ethnic deepness of the Jewish reli gion was somet hing that they actually felt 

connected to. 
 
Q: Even your grandparents™ generation? 

 

A: I think I think it was just Œ 

 

Q: Tradition. 

 
A: Yes, just the trappings of it. I don™t thi nk they were intel lectually rooted in Judaism.   
 

Q: Did the children that means your father and his siblings, what kind of schooling did 

they get? 

 

A:  My fa, well as I sai d m y father left school by the ti me he was 14.  And he was very 

frustrated with the schooling 
because
 it was German one day and then they™d come back 
from a vacati on and they, everything was i n Polish. Then everything was in Russian.  

And he just lost patience with the whole thing.  He just sai d to heck wi th it. 

 

Q: Well that™s what  happens when borders change. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
13
 
 
 
 
A: He just,  it was too frustrating.  
 

Q: Now your mot her, let™s turn to her side of the family.  Where was your mother from? 
 

A: My mother was born in Vienna.  

 

Q: And what was her maiden name? 

 

A: Her maiden name was 
Zehngut
, which means ten times good. And her parent s were 
Austrian.  Her father was a photographer and a inventor. He invented a washi
ng machine 
and he invented all kinds of useful things but he never made mone y. He never made 
money at that. 

 

Q: Someti mes it™s not the inventors who do. It ™s the people who take their ideas and 

market them. 

 

A: Right and there were no patents and everyt hing. But he was a very kindly person, very 
generous and very nice. 
 

Q: Do you remember him? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
14
 
 
 
A: Barely, barely. I remember m y mother™s i mpressions of hi m where he was very gentle 
and very kind to the girls. She had two si sters and she was the youngest. And h
er mother 

was, her maiden name was, the mother™s maiden name was Ernest ina 
Deutch
. 
 
Q: Ernestine German. 
 

A: Yes. And she had several siblings whom I knew.  And she actually was the 

breadwinner of the famil y and she did sewing which many of the women did in those 

days, be
cause 
everythi ng was hand made. Clothing was hand made.  And so she 

supported the family. And she was you know she had a tough job. She had a tough job.   
 
Q: At a time when that wasn™t acknowledged so easily or al most at all  by society that 
women were supporting families, more than men were.  Some of them ended up in such a 

predicament.  Was y
our 
maternal side of the fami ly well to do or struggling do you thi nk? 
 

A:  I think the y were st ruggling. I think they were struggling to be mi ddle class.  But the y 

valued cult ure. The y loved to go t o the opera and dances and beautiful clothes and 

Vienna was sort of a, I don™t know, high class place like Paris and New York.   
 
Q: Before the Austro-Hungarian empire fell i t certainly was. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
15
 
 
 
A: Yes, yes. and the trappings are still there. The Baroque buildings and the opera and 
museums and that™s stil l there. And the art and the music. Very, very proud of it, the 

Austrians. Especial ly the Viennese. 

 
Q: Do you know much about your mother™s si de of the family, if they had been Viennese 
for generations.  Or whether they had 
come from somepl ace else?
 
 

A: 
We
ll wi th the name of 
Deutch
.  I woul d guess that maybe they were sort of more from 
Germany 
and her father, 
Zehngut,
 had a branch of the 
family
 that was in Eisenstaedt, 
which is, well it was the mining area, probably more to the east. So t here is some 

relationship there.  So 
it
 was Aust ria.  
 

Q: Within thoselands, withinthe German speakinglands
--  
 

A: Exactly, 
exactly
. And the Austrian empire, the Hungari an empi re was quite extensive. 
 

Q: What was your mot her™s first name? 

 
A: Stella. 
 

Q: Stella. And so her maiden name was Stella, she was St ella 
Zehng ut
. 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
16
 
 
 
A: Correct. 
 

Q: Do you know how your parents met?  

 
A: I do not, I do not.   
 

Q: Were the y very different as people? 

 

A: I think so. I thi nk they were, I think m y mother was very proud of her Austrian 

heritage and sort of lauded it over my father who was, who was t he country bumpkin. 

 
Q: Well you know I didn™t want to ask it quit e like that but these are different worlds. 
The world of Vienna even if you are let™s sa y in a lower middle cl ass and the world of the 

town I can™t  pronounce. 

 

A: 
Knihynicze
. 
 

Q: 
Knihynicze
, t he world of 
Knihynicze
 
are two different ones and you know when 
they™re blended  you know how do they mix. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
17
 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah there was always that tensi on.  Yeah but you know she recognized t hat he 
alwa ys earned a good li ving and that he was very reliable and very dependable but had 

rough edges.   

 
Q: What were their personalities like as people, your parents. 
 

A: Well my father l oved to work. He really liked his work and he knew that he had 
ability.  He could l ook at something and make it. He coul d design somet hing new and 

did.  I have some of his furniture that he made for me.  Yes. Made here in the United 

States. So he was, he was really, I think he was a genius.  If he had, had any schooling he 

would have god knows where he would have been.  But and my mot her was very, you™d 
have to call it 
shtultz
, she was very proud.  And snooty. Kind of snooty.  I have to say 
that.  Yeah and so she alwa ys liked pretty things and  made sure that her girls had pretty 

things.  And that sort of thing. But she was a very strong  woman. I mean she, she was the 

one who si gned us up t o come to America.  My father was in 
Knihynicze 
taking care of 

things there. He was out of town at the time.  And she si gned us up.  When he came home 

it was fait accompli.                                                                                         

 
Q:Oh m y goodness.
 
 

A:  Yeah. He went crazy. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
18
 
 
 
Q: I can imagine. You know one parent taking you know the deci sion on the chil dren.  
And such a decision.  We™ll come to that.  But this sets the scene, this really does. And 

what about as parents. Was there one parent t hat you were closer t o t han the other?  
 
A: Well I think chil dren are especial ly girls are close to their mot hers.  And it™s only later 
that they discover t hat their fathers are peopl e too.  My father seemed brusque and he was 
very powerfully built so he was a little scary. 

 

Q: Was he a handsome man? 

 

A: I think so yes. The y were both handsome people. So yeah. 
 
Q: For a lit tle girl--  

 

A: He was tough.  He was yeah, I sort of  [
pushes hands away
] 
 

Q: Were your parent s strong disci plinarians? 

 
A:  Well they were very protective.  For girls. Very protect ive. But we were such good 
girls. We di dn™t do anything. We were such good girls. We were soŠ 

 

Q: You were well behaved. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
19
 
 
 
 
A:  --And nice, yes.  I don™t know where that came from.  But I made up for it.  (laughs)  

 

Q: The second part of one™s life one undoes t he first part.   
 
A: Probably.  [
wipes mouth
] 
 

Q: What do you remember from home, from your home i n Vienna. C an you tell me what 

it looked li ke?  

 

A: We had an apart ment in Vienna. I believe i t was on the second floor. And it was on 
Rohdenstern Gasse
.   
 

Q: 
Rohdenstern Gasse
. 

 

A: 
Rohdenstern Gasse
. 

 

Q:  Red star street.  Alley, actually.  
 
A: And I remember that each room had a ceramic heater.  

 

Q: You mean one of those old stoves that  you put coal into.  

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
20
 
 
 
 
A: Exactly. 

 

Q: Those used to be huge. 
 
A: The y, each room had its own heating.  You know Vienna being in Central Europe was 

quite chilly so yes, and it was heated with coals. The furniture, my fat her made every 

stitch. 

 

Q: Really.  Everything that you had Œ 

 
A: Everythi ng 
yes.
 
 
Q: Did he have a workshop nearby.  

 

A: Yes.  I don™t know the address of it. But it was nearby. And it was  a Jewish 

neighborhood.  And it was not fancy. I mean we didn™t have the furniture that we have 

today. We did not entertain at home.  And my children puzzled about that. That I don™t™ 
entertain.  They said di dn™t you entertain i n Vienna.  No.  People met in cafes.  They did 
not, it was only family that came home.  And had you know Œ 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
21
 
 
 
Q: Oh, so that™s li ke Manhattan. In Manhat tan people don™t have space to entertai n so 
they meet i n restaurants. 

 

A:  Well they meet i n restaurants, but this was you know this predates that by quite a bit. 
It was the home was for the family. 
 

Q: So it was more than just space. It was a tradition, it was a wa yŠ  

 

A: It was yes and, and it was around the dining room table and meals t hat one had 

entertainment with the family.  So there was not the easy chair kind of sitting area. There 

were bedrooms and there was probably like a big common area. I don™t remember the 
kitchen at al l.  I probably was not permitted to go into the kitchen.  We did have a maid.  
Because there was so much you know in terms of coal and, and laundry and cooking that 

unless you were very poor, you had a mai d.  

 

Q: It was far more prevalent in Europe Œ 

 

A: Yes. it was not unusual. You know it was not the status thing that we have. It was a 
necessity.  And the mai d very often would be a young woman from t he country who was 
looking for opport uniti es to meet a nice young man, somebody t hat wouldn™t be in her 

home town.   

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
22
 
 
 
Q: Everybody want ed to get away from all those eyes. 
 

A: Yes, yes.  Total ly understandable. But I do remember that the we had Christ mas for 

the maid and I would hang up a st ocking and I would get a hunk of coal in the, in the toe, 
just to keep me humble. And oranges.  And it was not a matter of toys so much but it was 
just you know litt le thi ngs. But I do remember the hunk of coal which was supposed to be 

if you were a bad girl. 

 

Q: And you weren™t. 

 

A: NO.  Let™s see what  else. I do, well when, when things got bad, after 
Kristall nacht
 
which was 1938, which I do remember. And so pretty soon the maid said that she 
couldn™t™ work for a Jewish family.  Her boyfriend was a Nazi. And so the maid left.   

 

Q: And that was a  real  change.  

 

A: It was, i t was. We really liked her.   

 
Q: What was her name? 
 

A: Erica.   

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
23
 
 
 
Q: Did your mother take in sewing like your grandmother did? 
 

A: No.  No she did not have to do t hat. 

 
Q: Was her role basi call y running the household? 
 

A: Exactly.  She was running the household and taking m y sister to school. And then 

when things got bad and she was t rying to figure out what to do, of course m y father was 

working.  Working, working. She was figuring out what t o do. She left us al
one. My 

sister went to school. Now I can™t i magine t hat  I was totally alone in t he apartment, but I 

would paint.  I was you know I was painting and drawing from the time I could hold a 
pencil. And so I was busy with my own t hings that I was doing. 
 

Q: And thi s was on paper not like on the walls or anything like that? 

 

A: No, no, no. Thi s was on paper with wat er colors and colored pencils. 

 

Q: I painted on the wal ls.   
 
A: No I wouldn™t think of that.  Oh m y goodness. You were a free spirit. 

 

Q: I paid.   

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
24
 
 
 
 
A: I bet yeah. No, no, t his was just at a desk.  And I would be busy for hours.   

 

Q: Let™s go back before history and politi cs and you know makes itself felt. Did you have 
plumbing and 
Œ 
 
A:Oh yes.oh yes, yes.
 
 

Q: So there was running water? 

 

A: Running water, plumbing.  
 
Q: There was a bathroom? 

 

A: Yes, yes.  Tub, yes. 

 

Q: And of course, I would assume, electricity. 

 
A: Yes.  Even a telephone. 
 

Q: You had a telephone. Did you have a radio? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
25
 
 
 
A:  Yes.  one of those big curvy jobs, yes. And m y father l istened i ntently in the evening 
to the radio.  

 

Q: Was it music or was it news or was itŠ  
 
A: Oh he wanted only t he news. But there was, there was music t oo, yes.   

 

Q: At the workshop where he worked, was he self -employed and the only person? 

 

A: He was, no he hired. He had people working for him and one worker in particular was 

he probably had been with hi m for years. And he actually warned us of 
Kristallnacht 
and warned that we were not to open the door, no matter what.  And when the st orm 

troopers and the Bl ack Shirts came and knocked on the door, and banged and called for 

m y father to come out, he did not. He would have been sent off to 
Buchenwa ld
 or god 

knows what.  

 

Q: So I just want to make sure. Can you tell me the name of that worker who warned 

your father.  Did you know hi m? 
 
A: I can™t come up with a name now.  I, I guess I didn™t, I didn™t ™ really go to t he shop.

the politics in it. You say and I™m going t o repeat a little bi t.  Your father was at t he 

workshop. He hired workers.  As subcontractors do you t hink or as permanent workers.

Q: Did your parents have much of a social life? 
 
A: I think t he y were mostly focused on family. 

 

Q: Did they talk much to one anot her about these events, this wi der world?  

 

A: My father sort of as I said, he listened to the radio and, and m y mother read the 

newspapers. And he sai d you know Hitler was a menace and that he was going to go after 
England which was you know out of the blue. Nobody really thought  that that would ever 
happen.  That he, he reall y he™s going to go after England.  My mother read the paper. 

And m y m
other sociali zed in the cafes.  And t here was an exchange of information. I 

mean that™s all the y, they really talked about was 
yo u
 know the oncomi ng menace and 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

how do we get out.  My mother, I don™t™ know how she got the addresses of the family 
that was in New York.  We wrote to them. Œ  

 

Q: You mean your father™s side of the family.  
 
A: Correct. She wrote t o them and asked for visas.  For t he family. 

 

Q: Did they supply them?  Did the New York relatives supply them.  

 

A:  Well I t hink they wrote back that the y were not wealthy and t hat they would send the 

visa for my father.  And that as soon as he became establi shed he would bring family.  
And that™s the way it had been done previousl y.  
 

Q: It™s true. In the first wave of immigration that  often is what happened. One family 

member came over and then brought the rest.  But who knew that this was not going to be 

that kind of situation --- 

 

A: Exactly, exactly.  So they sent papers, visa and their, i mmigration was tight.  Visas 
were allocated accordi ng to strict quotas and so the y sent visas for my father, and I 
believe for his brot her. 

 

Q: Washisbrother in Viennaas well?
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
33
 
 
 
 
A:  I guess so, I guess so.  I guess he lived wit h his mother.   And that was in a separate 

apartment. 

 
Q: So when you father had turned his back on the family, it wasn™t to his mother. 
 

A: It was much later. 

 

Q: Oh that was much later. 

 

A: It was state side, state side.  No he supported his family through thi ck and thin. And so 
the y sent those visas and not for m y mother and not for m y sister and me.  And so my 
mother, as I said, was constantly reading the newspapers and talking t o people and 

hearing what how everybody was trying t o get away. and she came across this article in 

the paper that this fami l y was coming. And they were goi ng to bring 50 children out of 

Vienna. 

 

Q: This must have been a Jewish newspaper. Was it? 
 
A: I don™t know. I, m y mother did not read Hebrew. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
34
 
 
 
Q: No, no but I mean a German speaking or maybe there weren™t any by that poi nt. 
Because I can™t imagine that in an Austrian newspaper such a thing would have been 

published. 

 
A: I think i t might  have been a little ad something like that. 
 
Q: Ma ybe something i nnocuous. 

 

A: Yeah. T he y were the 
Krauses
 were bel ow the radar.    The y were very, they did not 
call attention to themselves either in Vienna or when the y got to t he United States. It was 

very hush, hush.  There were 
kindertra nspo rts
 going to England.       
 

Q: A lot. 

 

A: Yes. And m y cousins went. 

 

Q:Your mother™s side?

Herta
 went to Engl and as an au pai r, to a 
family.  And Freddy was adopted i nto an English home, where they had already adopted

yell ing about the Jewish children so [

it was horri ble. And these were mothers, jeering at the Jewish children coming out of 
school. The y had separated the, you couldn™t go to a regular school. They were now into 
Jewish schools.

Q: Was thi s a one-
time
 visit or was this somet hing that he did on a regular basis?

A: Correct. 
 
Q: And what happens t hen? 

 

A: Well she inquired about it. And she said count me 
in. Take my girls, take m y girlsto 

America. And the hope was that when m y father™s family saw how desperate they were, 

by sending the girl s away alone, that the y would send the visa for her, which indeed is 

what happened. She, they did send the visa.  They saw that we were, did not have horns, 
that we were normal healthy girls and m y sister™s job was to beg t hem to send that last 
visa for my mother. 

 

Q:Oh m y gosh, whata 
Œ 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

ever but you know that  they, that was her t ask, one to look after me.  And two, t o 

convince them and she only had li ke one li ttle visit to send the papers for m y mother.  
 
Q: In what ways would you sa y your sister didn™t™ get over it? How did it show i tself? 

 

A: I think she alwa ys felt that she had extra responsibili ty and that I got a free pass, 

which there is some truth to that. 

 

Q: in some ways i t™s an echo of your father having had too many burdens. 
 
A: Exactly
, exactly.  
 
 

Q: But it i s a huge, you know had it not worked and it would never have been anything of 

your sister™s fault because she™s a child, the ki nd of burden that was on her should she 

fail, is huge.  So do you remember saying goodby to your mother? And your father? 

 
A: I remember the fight when m y father came home yelli ng and screaming and carrying 
on. What have you done? You must be craz y, i nsane to send your chil dren awa y.  But he 

already had t he visa and he already was secure.  And she was desperate, absolutely 

desperate. This was her last chance and our last chance.

mother and his brother to travel to America.

glass?  Being a carpent er™s daughter, I had a hint on that. You know stuff like that and,

in Berlin. I didn™t know why we were there. Apparently we were there to get the last exit 
papers. And if we hadn™t gotten those we woul d have had to turn around and go back 

home. So we were at this Jewish c, some kind of Jewish organization or building. And 

they, m y si ster and I were in bunk beds.  And there was a big to do downstairs i n the

street.  Marching 
and
 music and parade and, and so my sister j umped down from her 
upper bunk and came i nto my bed. And t hen we peaked out the window and we thought it 
was Hitler.  And we watched and saw this you know all this uniforms and flags and it 

was very frightening. It turned out it was a kind of the solidifying the relationship 
between Germany and Italy.  
Von Ribbentrop
 was representing the German Reich and 
Mussolini™s son i n law, 
Chiano
 , was representing the Ital ians and thi s was their 
allegiance, t heir alliance being cemented in with great pomp. As we watched it. 

 

Q: How did you trace t hat back because as a five year old you wouldn™t know. 

 

A: No, I thought i t was Hitler from all the pomp that was happening and the marching 
and the uniforms and t he flags.  Subsequently from Pressman, Steven Pressman™s book 
and his research filled i n the detail s. 

 

Q: Isn™t it i nteresti ng when you see dots that connect things that you yourself have seen.

A: We were on our own and m y mother said you are going to have a wonderful time.

the ocean.
 
 

Q: Were there other passengers, not part of thi s group of children. 

 

A: There must have been.   
 
Q: I wanted to get a sense of the ship life. Were there people on there who weren™t part of 

the group of children. Was it like a regular passenger liner.

explored and we found first class pla yroom with fabulous rocking horses and FAO 
Schwarz toys.  I mean we weren™t supposed t o be there.  But there were no other children 

there at the ti me.  so maybe there were no ot her children on the ship besides these. And 

so we availed oursel ves of that fabulous playroom.  And as far as I remember, we did not 

like the food.  It was not familiar.  But we did find a barrel of apples and we ate t hose.  

 

Q: You remember this? 
 
A: I remember yes, stealing apples. And but I don™t™ remember sit ting at a table. Or

Q: How was Inge doing? You know the older you were the less that security blanket can 
work. 
 

A: Well again she had a heavy responsibil ity t o keep track of me which was probably 

quite a job.  But she went along wi th me.  We had fun. And I don™t™ remember bei ng sea

hot water was sourced from the ocean. And it had a particular smel l.

Q: How sad. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
60
 
 
 
A: Amnesia and it was probably a safety mechanism.  It was too traumatic. It was too 
traumatic for several of them so the y blocked i t out.

organization had a summer camp.  Toda y I would call it li ke a motel and it was all on one 

floor. And we had our separate rooms.  And t here was an attempt to teach us English and 

baseball and stuff like that.  And we played hopscotch and games and  looked at the

allegiance which we were taught.  And it was just nice. It was pleasant.

A: No, I was receptive to it all.  You know it was all new and it was ok.  I didn™t™ have 

any great expectations or disappoi nt ment s you know. A lot of the members of this Jewi sh 

organization the Bri th Shalom of Philadelphia took an interest in the children and came to 
visit us.  And they brought you know the y were business people. Some brought hats that 
they had in their shop. Or they brought cakes.  They, they befriended us and visi ted us.  

And I made particul ar friends with somebody who had the ability to throw his voice. He 

was like a ventriloquist . And I just thought that was the most fabulous talent and we just 

had a great ti me tog
et
her. 
 

Q: So this is one of the visitors.

Q: Was she as carefree as you were? 

 

A: Probably not. 
Probabl y not.
 
 

Q: In general was she a serious personality? 

 

A:Oh yes, yes.
 

 

Q:  I put words, how would you describe her personality? 

 
A:  I don™t think she ever got out from under that cloud of responsibil it y.  And she just 
had very different interests. And I was successful in ways that she was not.  And that was 

hard.  That was hard for her because she felt t hat she had blazed the t rail and that I had an 

easy ti me.
 
 

Q: You said that before. 

 
A: So for instance I, I mean we both did well at school and stuff and, and skipped you 
know the New York Ci ty school system if you did well, t he y didn™t know what to do wi th 

you.  There was no such thing as enrichment. They just pushed you ahead so that you 

were in the next class. And so they pushed us both ahead and we had some of the same 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
66
 
 
 
teachers and, and that sort of thing. And t hen I tried out for a speci al high school in New 
York. Now she hadŠ 

 

Q: What hi gh school? 
 
A: High school of music and art.  She had t ried out for that school (bells ringing).  

 

A: You don™t want  to continue where we were. 

 

Q: We will, but no I won™t.  Ok. we had a break now and before going back to the point 

where we had our break. I wanted to ask a question that I hadn™t before. And that is your 
earliest memories total. 
 

A: Well the very earliest memory is of a curtain in probably in t he nursery which sort o
f 

we, the y were casement windows, which means that the y rolled out.  And when the 

breeze came i n, it woul d lift this curtain which was very airy and li ghtweight. And it 

would lift this curtain up and I just  thought of a giant outside the window breathing in 

and out because the curtain would rise up and t hen fall.  It would rise up and fall. And I 
remember the fabric so distinctly. It was pale sort of a pea green wit h white leaves ovoid 
leaves scattered throughout the curtain. And t here was  a heavy thread running t he warp 

of the fabric to make it hang right. And if I ever ran into that I would know that fabric in 

a minute. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

Q: Isn™t that amazing.  

 

A: And that was, it was the very earl iest memory t hat I had.  
 
Q: The logic of a child. 

 

A: The giant.   

 

Q: A giant you know. how could a curtain move like that.  

 
A: Right. repetition, you know in and out, in and out.  And we were on the second floor 
so it had to be a giant. 

 

Q: So are we talking second floor American or second floor European. 

 

A: Vienna. 

 
Q: So it would be the t hird floor  in the United States because there™s the 
adgeschloss
 and 
then there is the first floor and then there i s the second floor. that™s the wa y it is in 
Europe.  So if it was the second floor from what you remember from Europe then it 

would be the US Third floor.   

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
68
 
 
 
 
A: there was a courtyard in the center of the house. Now these houses were very old.  So 

the courtyard was probably at one time where carriages would enter t his large gate of this 

entrance and then there would be t his courtyard and then t hese wide curved stairs, going 
upstairs. 
 

Q: And did your house have windows goi ng onto the street or into the courtyard as well? 

 

A: Yes.  Both. 

 

Q: Both. Was it a house that was of stone or brick or Œ 
 
A: I™m not sure.  I don™t know what the construction was, but it ma ybe had five floors, 

five stories high. 

 

Q: Put up probably wood. ok so l et™s go back to the camp that you were in outsi de 

Philadelphia, that first summer when you were here.  And you make a new friend who 

knows how to throw hi s voice, the ventriloqui st. And the only ti me you saw your relative,

A: Exactly. 

 

Q: You didn™t know this at the ti me though. 

 

A: No we did not.  I mean I wasn™t in touch with her.  The letters you know went back 
and forth would take weeks and no telephone and nothing like that.  No Twitter.  No 
Skype.  So we didn™t know anything.  

 

Q:  All of this is going on but you don™t know it. You and your si ster are unaware. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

the beginning of June when we arrived. And so the y arri ved and Œ  

 

Q: The y picked you up. 

 

A: The y picked us up.  And somehow we got t o Brooklyn where the fami ly had set up an 
apartment sort of like a, like a railroad flat.  Al l the rooms were in line. And, and we 
settled in.  and war broke out officiall y September 1. 

 

Q: I mean t he y got in by a hair™s breadth. 

 

A: By a hair. And so September comes around and we start school. Not speaking Engl ish 

and m y mother described us walki ng to t he school weepi ng because we couldn™t 
understand and couldn™t  speak.  But the teacher spoke Yiddish and so she said don™t 
worry. I™ll take care of them.  And you know within weeks we were speaking English.   

 

Q: Of course, but t he beginning is difficult. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
71
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah the very, the very start was hard. But people were friendly. It wasn™t like it was 

in Austria.  It wasn™t that wa y. There was nobody jeering and throwi ng things at us.  And 

so we started school and you know learned English, fit right in.   
 
Q: Cool, very cool. 

 

A: Yeah it was like a magical age you know. [
gestures idea of ﬁmarginﬂ
]  Just that little 
margin of adaptabili ty. 

 

Q: And also being shielded and protected from the larger events and t he reasons for them. 
 
A: Right, well of course that was al l that my parents talked about was what was 

happening i n Europe and my mot her had her fami ly there.  And recei ved letters 

periodically that had big pieces censored out [
gestures ﬁcensored piecesﬂ
], black marks 
cut. And so she pieced it together t hat her father was dying of cancer.  And, and pretty 

soon those letters stopped.  

 
Q: Did your father ever say to your mother you were right . I was wrong. 
 

A: Not that I know of.  No.  But they were very, very happy.  And then we were at some 

kind of family gathering and I don™t re, family was talking and the y asked m y 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
72
 
 
 
grandmother somet hing about how her life was in Europe. Oh, she said it was terrible, 
terrible.  And it was she never got anything, she never had anythi ng and so m y father said 

well who bought your shoes.  And who paid your passage.  And he was just he was 

humiliated in front of these strangers who were family. I don™t know what 
her motivation 
was. Ma ybe she was just stupid.  You know she could have been st upid.  Or she you 
know this was before social security and things like that. Maybe she thought that she 

would do better by throwing herself on these relatives. And my father was just more than 

incensed.   

 

Q: I can imagine. 

 
A: And that was the end of that.  And he t ook a job in the Bronx and we moved to the 
Bronx which was l ike you knowŠ

his, what his business was. He was elderly. He had a parrot, I re member that. And he 
used to cut the parrot™s toenails, claws, yes.   But he broke off. 

 

Q: So it was through hi s mother actually, more than the rest of the sibl ings that t his kind 

of absolute unawareness of what his sacrifice had been. 

 

A: Mm hm.   
 
Q: And when you moved to the Bronx, when was that? 

 

A: I think I was in about third grade. I remember--

A: Unh hunh. 

 

Q: And your father, how did he make a living? 
 
A: He was a carpenter.  

 

Q: His own. Or did he work for somebody. 

 

A: Well he worked for somebody and then he lost patience completel y and set up 

practically next door.  In the Bronx.  And so he had an apartment first .  And then m y 
mother noticed, she would walk from the apartment, two blocks around the corner to his 
shop.  And one da y she was walking by and people were moving furni ture out of one of 

the houses.  And so she inquired and it turned out an old lady had lived there and died.  

And she, well you know can I buy this house.  And I don™t know.  They said something 

ridiculous, but $5000 and it™s yours.  And she went to the bank without m y father™s 

knowledge, plunked down $5000 and the house was ours.  So here was the second time 

that she acted totally on her own and it was wonderful. It was wonderful.  It was Œ

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

Q: And did he own his workshop or did he rent it? 

 

A: No, he rented the space.  Yes. And original ly i t had an apart ment behind it and he 

thought that ma ybe we should move there.  And m y mother said oh no.  She™s not going 

to raise her f, her chi ldren, her girls, in thi s situation.

own businesses and he would make their showcases and their store fronts. And if he was 
out of the shop, somebody had to mind the store. So she stayed at the store. While he was 

out. 

 

Q:  That real ly does sound like an amazing, I don™t want to sa y easy but so much easier 

than someone who doesn™t have that skill.  

 
A: Oh of course. I know people who were lawyers and whose skills did not transfer.  And

went to temple. My mother did.  Once in a whi le, for holida ys. And Yom Kippur and

Rosh Hashanah. He said there was no god if this could happen and ne just turned his back 
on the whole thing. 

 

Q:  Wow.  Because so many other people had the reverse t hing. The y did not particularly 
feel themselves to be Jewish and then when they were targeted said all right now. I™m not 
going to pretend to be someone I™m not. Did that seem strange to you at the time or is just 

that™s his choice and that™s her choi ce. 

 

A: Definitely.  It wasŠ 

 

Q: What about you and your sister? 
 
A: My sister felt more connected to, to her Jewish heritage.  She when the y were in 

Florida, she participated at a templ e.  I never have.  And her daughter also seems more 

connected to the Jewish heritage and not t hat she keeps a kosher home but she you know 

she™s connected to the community. And I™m not. 

 

Q: Was thi s a conscious thing or i s the wa y you developed in 
yo ur
 int erests and how the y 
grew?  

 

A:  Well I™m an atheist and I just from m y experience and m y readi ng I have come to that 

conclusion.  If anyt hing, I™d be a Buddhist.

Q:  Did your parent s eventually find out what happened to various family members? 

 

A: The y di d.  The y I mean some people just di sappeared like 
Tager
.  And I think one of 
m y father™s brothers just disappeared like a bl own leaf. We did know that m y grandfather 
passed. And we knew that Olga and her mother, my grandmother, were pushed from one 

apartment t o another. I alwa ys tho ught that they were toget her, but  I subsequently learned 

that they al so were separated.  

 

Q: How did you discover this? 

 
A: A friend, a cousi n of my ex-husband  is very savvy on the internet and she puzzled it 
out. 

 

Q: So it™s a recent knowledge. 

 

A:  Yes, yes.  I alwa ys had a little fantasy t hat somehow they went off to the Vienna 

woods and hid.  And survived. 
 
Q: As you were growing up, tell me a little bit about school, about high school, about 

how did your life devel op. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
81
 
 
 
A: Well I enjoyed school.  I had friends in school. I applied to the high school of music 
and art which was a special high school that you auditioned for in New York. And I 

prepared a portfolio and auditioned and was accepted.  And that was probably the biggest 

learning experience. 
 
Q: Wa
s it really? 

 

A: Yes, cause I was wit h a wide variety of people, very diverse st udent body from all 

over the city. Some very well-heeled people, some people who were very political.  There 

was one gal whose father was a died and hard communist.  There were people of color 

which was unusual . That wouldn™t ™ have been in the neighborhood school.  There was a 
Chinese girl that I was very friendly with, Gloria Wong. And when the communi sts took 
over in China, I hadn™t a clue. I said well what  do you thi nk?  And she said I think it™s 

going to be a better thing for China.  Thi s was the era of the Rosenberg trials. And it was 

very, it was still very conflicted. It was still very, the world was comi ng to m y awareness.   

 

Q: That™s normal when you™re in high school. That™s what  happens you know. 

 
A: But I was so happy at that school.   I just, I just blossomed.  I coul dn™t wait for 
summer vacation to end and go back to hi gh school, which is not your t ypical high school 

experience. 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
82
 
 
 
Q: No it isn™t.   
 

A: But I was very l ucky.  Yeah. and I still  have friends from high school. Yes. And then 

when I went off to college, it was a total di sappoint ment. It was not as sti mulating as hi gh 
school.  
 

Q: Where di d you go t o college? 

 

A:  Well I started out at  Brooklyn College.  Which was free.  The city colleges of New 

York, I mean totally unbeknownst  to anybody toda y were free.  Just li ke high school and 

so I would meet m y friends on the subwa y. There was quite a littl e contingent that went  
from the Bronx to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn College, because they had a very interesti ng art 
department.  And but of course you know it was a liberal arts school and so I had classics 

and I had hi story and I had language and yeah.  
 

Q: But it wasn™t as sti mulating. 

 

A: No, it was not. It was a come down. 
We 
had artists.  I mean it was sort of like a 
carry
-
over from the WPA projects where the y hired artists in t he art depart ment to teach.  So I 

had Mark Rothko as a t eacher.  The poor man could not put two words together.  He was 

a wonderful artist but he was not a teacher. I had Clyfford Still and William Bazeotis and 

all these fabulous names toda y. The y were struggling artists at the time.  Anywa y the y 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
83
 
 
 
were not good teachers. And so I decided t hat and I really wanted t o know about art. I 
wanted to know the background and so I was interested i n art hist ory.   And Barnard 

College at that ti me was investing heavily in their art hist ory department. And I was told 

to apply and I did and I got in and so I have a degree from Barnard College which is 
prestigious. 
 

Q: A quest ion.  You mentioned the different languages when you were at home at  lunch 

time and going back to school. Di d that every change. Did you ever end up speaking 

English at home?  

 

A:  I think, I think yes. As the years went by. They understood.  My parents understood 
more than t he y could speak.  My mother was pretty proficient but my father there, never, 
I mean he spoke Yi ddish.   

 

Q: Did he speak any ot her language besides German and Yiddish. Di d he speak Polish, 

did he speak Russi an, did he speak Š  

 

A: He just had a few phrases and he even had what, he had an English phrase like son of 
a bitch. Somebody when he was a kid had come back and taught hi m son of a bitch and 
he used that . 

 

Q: He knew that from t hen. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
84
 
 
 
 
A: Yes he knew that from 
Knihynicze.
 
 

Q: Isn™t that funny.   Did you ever feel like you were an outsider when you were in the 
United States. 
 

A:  [
shakes head ﬁnoﬂ
]  No. 
 

Q: So there was no sense of I don™t really belong to this society. I™m from over 

somewhere else.
 

 
A: Never. [
shakes head ﬁnoﬂ
]  Not in New York, not in Connecti cut, not in Mai ne.  No, I 
just it™s where I™m at. 
 

Q: Did you ever think of Vienna. 

 

A: I™ve gone back to visit. 

 
Q: I want t o come t o that point about returning to your st ory. You mentioned that you are 
writing your memoir
s. 

 

A: Mm hm. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
85
 
 
 
 
Q: what prompted you to look back and when did you start looking back? 

 

A:  I think I™ve always been sort of an introspective person.  And I realized that my 
grandchildren who are not near and have not been close to me or I to t hem. Cause they™ve 
always grown away, grown up awa y from me.   

 

Q: You mean geographically distant? 

 

A: Yes.   But you know geographic distance also means emotional distance. And 

knowledge and knowing somebody.  So I thought that I would cl ue them and help them 
out to know me a l ittle better. 
 

Q: And that™s what ™s prompted the memoirs? 

 

A: Correct, correct. 

 

Q: How far along have you gotten? 
 
A: Well I can™t sa y i t™s a thing that  goes chronologically from here to there.  It™s a series 

of stories.  Of things that happened. Of things that I™ve thought about.  And we™ll  put 

them together in some kind of a scrapbook and that™ll be it.  

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
86
 
 
 
 
Q: Those are the kinds, the most precious gifts now. 

 

A: I hope so, I hope so. 
 
Q: When di d you first go back to Vienna? 

 

A: My sister has gone back several times.  And then one ti me, we went together. And we 

went with m y niece also, Tina, her daughter.  And well m y sister had some mone y there. 

And she filed for social security basically where she paid i nto the system and then 

accumulated m
one y out of the system, which, which was effective if she spent the mone y 
there. In Europe. And so she was motivated to use that mone y. I never bothered to pa y 

into the system. I don™t  care about it  and I don™t want it.  And she planned to live to be a 

hundred so she would use it all.  That didn™t quite work that wa y. So we went back hm, 

I™m trying to think of when.  In t he 90s.  And ma ybe 92 or so.  And we went to 

Rohdenstern Gasse
.  And we went to the 
Prater
 and we went to the Vienna woods and 

we went to the opera. And then Pat and I, m y partner, went to Vi enna also as part of a trip 

that included Budapest and Prague. And I don™t like Vienna.  I find it stuffy, baroque and 
false, pretentious.  I don™t, I don™t like it at  all. 
 

Q: Is there anything that was famil iar or di d you, when you went you felt like you were 

kind of to a place you had never been before? 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
87
 
 
 
 
A: No, I was touri st, I was a touri st.  I had m y eyes open and I was curious and we went  

to Salzburg, went to a play there.  It turned out to be a play about an old age home and 

m y sister said oh, why do we want to go to see that.  Cause it interests me. I didn™t get all 
the nuances of the language but I got enough of it.  But it was i nteresting, it was 
interesting. We went to performances and I t hought that the y were just stuffy.  They were 

for tourists. There was nothing wi th heart.  We went to Bratislava which was just recently 

liberated from Russian domination and we went to the opera. And they were, th
e y could 

have been bus drivers. It just had, they were just doing a job. You know the y had no 

heart.  The y had no emotion in to the part. It was just a businessman™s opera. It was, it 

was nothing. It was just nothing. 
 
Q: What a disappoi ntment. 

 

A: Yeah, cause my parents loved opera.  And we went to the opera in New York. We 

went to the City Center and we went to the Met. 

 

Q: You have menti oned off camera that in 1998 I believe it was you went to Auschwitz. 
 
A: I did. 

 

Q: Tell me about that trip and what that was all about. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
88
 
 
 
 
A:  Well it™s somet hing called the March of the Living.   And apparently, well it™s a 

Jewish organization that tries to get young people to understand t he Holocaust and their 

heritage first hand.  So the y were mostly young people, but there were some survivors. 
And we were on a bus.  And I made friends wi th several people.  One of whom, Sophia 
Afariat
 was spent the war years in Poland.  And she spoke fluent Polish so she had the 

advantage of language. And we went to restaurants and things like that and she could 

speak fluently with people. We went to 
Krakow
.  We went to Warsaw. And went to 
some of the stations that Jews were assembled. We went to the ghetto.  It was the first 

time that I was with very devout Jews. The young people were devout.  The y pra yed, on 

the airplane.  So that was the first. And then we went to Israel.    (pause, somethi ng 
happening off camera)  We have to stop every time that door opens and closes.  
 

Q: What are the most memorable 
moment s for you of that trip.  

 

A: For the trip. Well seeing 
Krakow
 which my father had spoken of was a high point.  
I 
thought that well, um, Warsaw was just a gray depressing place.  We had a bus that took 

us from one place to another. We had guards on the bus. We had a Polish soldier who 
was on leave earning extra mone y, accompanyi ng us on the bus. 
 

Q: And the purpose of his presence? 

 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
89
 
 
 
A: Well there™s a lot  of anti-Semit ism, a lot of anti-Semitism.  We went to a little village I 
don™t even know that it had a name. But it was a typical village, shtetl, town. The Jewish 

synagogue, and there were no more Jews li ving there but it somehow, I don™t know who 

took care of it.  So the synagogue had, was neatly tended.  And the church was on the top 
of the hill.  So the church was on the hill. And the synagogue was down here. [
gestures 
location of  church and synagogue
]  There was a contingent of Polish soldiers, with a tank 
stationed at  the synagogue.  The y were playi ng cards.  But there was a military presence.  

We passed houses that were very derelict that probably had not been lived in for a 

number of years. We passed another place t hat was like a farm where the y were very neat 

and tidy. They had cranes nesting in this chi mney.  I™d never seen anything like that and 

that was a ti dy farm. So you know if the people who had the place could take care of it, 
had the wherewithal  to take care of it, had the energy and t he skill and ma ybe some 
money to t ake care of i t, the y did well.  If the people were old, poor, the place was 

derelict. 

 

Q: So you saw these types of thingsŠ  

 

A: I saw that yes.  This lady Sophia, who had spent the war.  She was able to talk to our 
guard and sort of befriend hi m and find out who he was. And that™s how I know that he 
was on furlough and st uff like that. We went t o a place in Krakow that was sort of a folk 

art place. And I wanted to buy something for my grandchild who was little at the time.  

My first grandchil d.  And so we bought something there. And I brought it to the hotel, 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
90
 
 
 
opened it up and it had shattered into you know 42 pieces.  So the next da y we went back 
and I said well you know this, you packed it poorly. I need somet hing else.  And oh, no. 

No the y wouldn™t, the y wouldn™t™ honor t hat and so Sophia said we are Jews.  And she 

played the Jew card. I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that she felt it necessary 
to draw that  card. And he said ok, pick out somet hing else.  We went to a Jewish 
cemetery and there was this little old lady scuttling through the cemet ery. And Sophia 

started talki ng to her.  And she had spent the war.  She was Jewi sh. She had spent the war 

there.  She, she had no prospects of going anywhere else.   

 

Q: The lady in the cemetery? 

 
A: Yes.  And that was her life.  I don™t know, I think she was doi ng a short cut t hrough 
the cemetery to her home.  Yeah. And she lived in that t own with her daughter.  

 

Q: Did you feel in some wa y distant from these things or close to these things? 

 

A: No, I felt close t o that, I did.  It was very emotional. And when we went to Auschwitz 

there were graffiti, anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls outside of Auschwitz, just outside.  
The y do keep the grounds themselves preserved. But it was very emotional. And so I l eft 
a note saying you know but for fortunate kindness in this worl d, I would be here too.  

[
shrugs shoulders
] 
 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
91
 
 
 
Q: Have you gone t o any other of theseŠ 
 

A: Well that was part of the trip. We went t o 
Sobibor
 and we went yeah, the whole, yep. 

 
Q: Let™s go back a little bit. To when you finished Barnard college.  How did your life 
evolve after that? 

 

A: WellIgot marri ed. Andthat made me very happy.He wasa wonderful young man.
 
 

Q: What was his name? 

 
A:  Eugene.  He had a very supportive family. My family loved hi m so all was good.  It 
was good. 

 

Q: How many children do you have? 

 

A: Two sons. One lives in Ann Arbor, Mi chigan with two daughters who are now going 

to live on t he east coast , one of whom is a graduate student  at Harvard.  And the other 
one is just a graduate out of the college at Wooster, Ohio.  I have a son now in LA, who 
had two chi ldren, one of whom is in Providence, Rhode Island at Brown University.  And 

the daughter is a hi gh school graduate, graduat ed, senior and she plans to go into musical 

theater.  She™s very, very talented. 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
92
 
 
 
 
Q: Have you talked about these things with them? About your childhood, about your 

escape? With your chil dren, with your grandchildren? 

 
A: A little bit.  Well they™ve seen the, they™ve seen video of the 50 children that  Steven 
Pressman made.  The y have the book. The y have very casual interest i n it all.  

 

Q: How do you think it  shaped you? Did it shape you? Did it cont ribute to you being th
e 

kind of person that  you are today?  

 

A: Oh, completely.   
 
Q: In what way? 

 

A:  I don™t know. If I had remained in Austria, and there had been no war, I would be a 

German 
hausfrau
.   
 

Q: Artist?  
 
A: I don™t know. I think that women still have a very tangential life t here. I think it™s still 
very patriarchal.  I think there is st ill some ant i-Semitism that keeps people from 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
93
 
 
 
dreaming and thinking that the y could be something more.  I don™t think I™d have the 
education t hat I have. I™d be somebody else. 

 

Q: In your personality, has it had an effect on things that are your values or the wa y you 
look at thi ngs, that earl y history. 
 

A: Well I think my mother™s message that I™m going to have a wonderful time and to be 

open to new experience has been m y wa y of doing things. 

 

Q: What a wonderful gift. 

 
A: I know.  
 

Q: Tell me about how t he rest of their years were here in the United States. 

 

A:  My, when m y sister hit adolescence my fat her lost it.  He, he want ed to impose kind 

of the old protection. He did not understand that girls have you know rights and thought s 

of their own. He made life very hard for her. Constant bickering and constant pi cking on 
her, constant demeaning.  He did not understand that she wanted to wear somet hing that 
he didn™t™ approve of.  Lipstick drove hi m up the wall.  And, and she, she was destroyed. 

And m y mother could not stop hi m. I don™t know what he had in mind.  
Loose women 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner
 
94
 
 
 
you know wear lipstick and he just, he just had a totally, totally ot her way of looking at a 
young woman. 

 

Q: It sounds al most like a village he came through. 
 
A: Exactly. Don™t be this and don™t be that and be careful  here [
gestures with hand
] and 
be careful there and he just made her life miserable.  Somehow I did not get it int o his 

craw the wa y she did.  That was something deep set hi m off.  I did not buck hi m. I put on 

lipstick around the corner.  I did not, I di dn™t, I didn™t defy him. I just  went m y own wa y. 

And somehow, he coul d accept that .   So again she was the pioneer. She got the full brunt 

of his ire.  And the only wa y she could think of to get out of it was t o get married which 
she did when she was 17. 
 

Q: Very young. 

 

A: Didn™t work out too well.  Of course.  So.   

 

Q: Your parents, di d they sta y in t hat nice brick house in the Bronx. 
 
A: The y di d.  Unti l m y sister, my sister di vorced that husband and remarried and the y, 

with her new husband and her daughter who was Tina was about  eight by that t ime, 

moved to Florida.  My parents had vacationed in Florida.  Just briefl y you know go on 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

two weeks™ vacation.  The y liked it.  And I don™t know if you were around at the ti me but 
Arthur Godfrey radio program really was a spokesman for Florida. And he talked up 

Florida. And so my sist er asked m y father t o come down and bui ld something for her. To 

build, I don™t know, some kind of storefront and of course he went. And he was not a 
young man at that t ime.  So my mother saw an opportunity to get hi m out of his regular 
routine and the y started talking about retiri ng t o Florida.   

 

Q: Nice. 

 

A: Which t he y did.   

 
Q: Where in Florida? 
 

A:  The y bought a place in Coral Gables. They li ke Miami. There was a large Jewish 

contingent there, a lot of lands people. And they were very happy t here. 

 

Q: Did they ever go back to Europe?  

 
A: No. At one point my father wanted me t o go with him to some of his haunts like 
B a d 
Kastine
. And I had littl e kids at the time and so it wasn™t that, I couldn™t do it.  Yeah.  
 

Q: The y passed away i n Florida? 

Interview w ith Kitt y Weiss Penner

A:  Yes.  My mot her had a series of heart at tacks and died at age 59.   

 

Q: Oh m y gosh, how young. 
 
A: Yeah.  And my father was like 12 or 13 years older, he lived t o be 88.  On his own, in 

Florida.  

 

Q: On your journe y over to the United States what would you want your grandchildren 

and everybody else™s grandchildren cause t his will be on the internet, what woul d you 

want them to understand the most about that journey? 
 
A:  Hm.  I think it is to just keep an open mind and keep your e yes open to experience 
things for yourself, not what somebody told you, not what  you read in a book, just be 

there.  Be there and see it for yourself. And live it for yourself.  And make whatever 

sense you can of that experience.  It™ll be your own.  

 

Q: Is there anything else you™d like to add to what we™ve talked about today. 
 
A: No it™s been good. Thank you.
