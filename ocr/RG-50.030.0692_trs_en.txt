in flying a n d  there was the a v i a t i o n  cadet
 p r o g r a m .  A n d Ilo ok ed  into that and 
what attracted meto that,other than
 the flying aspect, was aviation cadets 
were paid $75 a mon t h  v e r s u s  21 as a d r
a f t e d p r i v a t e  into the A r my .  Soitwas

en tran ce exam on v a r i o u s subjects that al
lowed me to join the a v i a t i o n  cadet

A: I simpl y  took a test.
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A: I -- I don't want to say I was f a i r l y  intelligent but I had a fairly good 
knowledge o f many things.Ididfairly
 well inhigh sc h o o l  a n d  had agood 
knowledge ofEnglish andchemistry a
n d physicsand most ofthe subjects I 
took in h i g h school were in s c i e n c e s .
 
Q:Did you go to ar e c r u i t i n g  s t a t i o n ?
 
A:No.There was--Idon't think itwas 
called a -- I don't know, it was probably 
the city h a l l  w h ere they were g i v i n g
 exams foraviation c a d e t  recruits.

A: I p rob ab ly  knew almost immed i ately --
 

Q: O k a y .
 
A: -- that I had high enough grades in taking t h e  test.
 
Q:And were you g i ve n  s h i p p i n g  o r d e r s
 at t h a t  time? Did you know wh e t h e r  
you were g o in g  t o  t r a i n i n g ?
 
A: No, it was p r ob ab ly  five months later t h a t  I sh ipped out to -- or I shipped 
into aplace f o r  c l a s s i f i c a t io n .
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q:And what was that experien ce? What was y o u r  very first military  experien ce 

w h e n  you e n t e r e d ?
 
A: Oh, it was different. When I boarded a train, went down to N a shv ille, 
Tennessee, we w e r e classified -- actu ally we took some basic t r a i n i n g  down 

there, welearned howtomarch anddo 
KP a n d  all the things that usually new 
recruits do-- and took some tests down 
there to see -- we we
re i n theAirC o rp s 
and tosee what wewould b e classified as. And Ihad apreference ofbeing a 
pilot andp a ssed enough of th
e test s that t h ey classifiedmeasapilot recruit.
 
Q:And how did they est a b l i s h  that p r
ef er en ce? Were 
you merely asked or did 
you fill out a f o r m ? How did you ex p r ess 
that you w a n t ed  tobea p i l o t ?  
 
A:It h i n k  t h e  f a c t  t h a t  w e  
jo ined  the Air Corpswe wanted to be apilot, p e riod .
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A:Yeah. And a l o ng the way t h ey wo u ld c l
a s si f y  you, depending onanumber of 
tests we took w e  would be a pilot, a navigato r, bomb ardier. S o  I wanted to be a 
pilot and expressed a desire t o  be a singl
e engine pilot. And 
there 's aseries o f  
tests,  Ithi nk, that wetook that they
 d e t e r m i n e d  and sent us on for further 
training.
 
Q:When did you -- when 
were you i n f o r m e d  that 
you hadbeenselectedfor 
flight school?
 
A: I think from N a shv i l le ,  Tennessee, wh
ich w a s sort ofbasic army t r a i n i ng ,  
we went to Mitchell Fields and basically
 just went toschool there.Westudied 
meteorology, navigation, map reading.Welearned reading of code. They gave 

u s  basically a -- almost a two-year co
llege course i n  acouple of weeks.
 
Q: R i g h t .
 

A:They just cramme d usfull ofknowledge,  yeah.
 
Q:Was it mostly --what was the environment like?Mostly in the classroom, 
m o s t l y  in the c o c k p i t  o r all c l a s s r o o m ?
 
A:Itwas all c l a s s r o o m .  Weh a dn 't even seen  a n  a i r p l a n e  yet. Yeah, itwas 
certainly all -- and alot of military tr
aining, doing what you w eretold. The 
cadet program was like West P o int, i t  wa
s very, very strict. 
What wewould do, 
we h a d to do alot of parade stuff and we
 were c l as s i f i ed  asunderclassman for a 
while and had todo --wegot hazed by the u p p e rc la s s m a n . It w a s  b a sically  like 
West P o i n t ,  you kno w .
 
Q :I s e e .  W h a t  w a s  t h e  b i g g e s t  c h a
llenge for you acad
emically? Orwasthere 
any acad emicchallengesforyou?
 
A:Ican't think ofany that bothered me. Most all mytraining came easy. Itried 
tostay out o f  t r o u b l e .  One of the f e a r s was if you were c a u g h t  in a lie or d o i n g  

something, they would wash y o u out.Y
oujust never wanted  todoany t h i ng  
t h a t  wasnot proper. Wewere trained tobe o f f i c e r s andg e nt l e me n  Œ
 
Q: R i g h t .
 
A:--and wejust tried tokeep our nos
eto t h e g r ind s to n e , because we didn't  
want to get w a s h e d out. F l y i ng paywas 
good, weall had ad e si r e  t o  be p i lo t s .  
Yeah.
 
Q:Did you have any c l a s s m a t e s  who you 
fel t w e r e  s t r u g g l i n g ,  thatyouhadto 
help out?
 
A:Never got close to any of the classmates.
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A:Yeah. At least I didn't. But in the t h
i n g  they told ustolook toyour rig h t  
and look t o  your left, one ofyou are g o i n g  toget w a sh ed  out.The w a sh ou t rate 
was fairly  high.
 
Q: Did that prove to be true?
 
A:Y e s .  Y e a h .  Y e a h .  Al o t  
of the cadets w e r e  washed 
out early.Theycouldn't 
meet the academic standards ordidsome
infractionorsomething l i k e  that.
 
Q:W h ere did they gowhen they 
were w a sh e d  out?Doyou kn ow ?
 
A: I have no idea. I think probably went back into service someplace.
 
Q: O k a y .
 

A: Yeah.
 
Q:Soa f t e r  you c o m p l e t e d  that part of 
c a d e t  t r a i n i n g ,  then did you go to f l i g h t  
school?
 
A: Y e s .
 
Q: Okay. And wh ere --
 
A: After I f i n i sh e d  that I went down to Avon Park, F l or i d a .
 
Q: Uh-huh?
 
A: There was a private airfield  with p r i v
a t e instructors. They were civilians, 
theywere n o t  militarypilot instructors.Itwasa p r i m a r y  flight school.You 
flew open cockpit bi - p l an e s. Itwas 
aS t e a r ma n ,  with the win d  flow --
 
Q: R i g h t .
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q:What year was th at?
 
A: That was in '43.
 
Q: '43.
 
A: Uh-huh
 
Q:Okay. What was that e x p e r i e n c e  l i k e?
 Take m e  back tothe f i r s t  ti me you 
climbed into a c o c k p i t  either alone or
 with another person. What w a s  that 
exp e rien ce like?
 
A: It was sort of scary. I had been up in a s m a l l  aircraft a couple of times prior to 
being in th e  service butitwasn't inanopen co ck p i t - ty p e plane. Iwasalittle bit 

subject to a i r  sickn ess, and I r e m e m b e r  I used to carry a l e m o n  in my pocket and 

sort ofsqueeze lemon juice i n t o  mymo
uth tokeep from being too n a u s e o u s . 
B u t that w ent away with 
--after some flights with t h e  in stru cto r. Andwedid 
mo re and mo re c r a z y  ma n o e uv r e s.  We did l o op s, wedid slow rolls, a n d  Isoon 
grew accustomed tovarious position s in a n  aircraft.
 
Q:Did you e n j o y  it?
 
A: Yeah, I did. I thought it was great. H e r e  I am, a hot pilot. But one day the 

i n s t r u c t o r j u m p e d  out and sa i d ,  " T
ake it up. Try not to k i l l  y o u r s e l f . "
 
Q:And what was that like?
 

A:Itwas f i n e . Ihadnop r o b l e m s at all. I t a x i e d  out, did a c i r c l e  a r o u n d ,  came 
in f o rlanding. It was very good. Ihad no accidents,noproblems at all.
 
Q:Was the same sort ofaircraft, abi-plane o p e n  cockpit --
 
A:Yeah, Isoloed inthePT-13, aS t earman  was th e aircraft.
 
Q: R i g h t .
 
A:It was n i c e .  And we st i l l  got alot 
o f  i n st ruc t ion s . Welearnedaerobatics, 
unusu a l  positions
 and recovering  -- stalls, r e c
over i ng from stalls. We learned 
all the basic things o f  flying. And I 
got through that without b e i n g  washed 
out, so...
 
Q: You f i n i s h  up at A von .
 
A: R i g h t .
 
Q: Now wh at h a p p e n s ?
 
A:Then Iwent to basic.
 
Q: Where?
 
A: I went to Macon -- no -- yeah, M a co
n,Georgia.Yeah, I went to Macon, 
Georgia,for basic air_training. PrimarytraininginFlorida,then b a si c 
training. And got abigger aircraft. Ithad more things about it. Itwas alow-

wing monoplane, aclosed co
ckpit versus being in an
 open c o c k p i t aircraft. 
Still had a -- I don't think I had a -- I think I had an Army Air Force in stru cto r. 

And,again, itwasaplane that wasd i
fferent. We had, I think, a two-speed 
propeller. Therewere m o r e controlson it.Ithinkwehad flaps.Itwas alow-

wing monoplane. Alot more h o rsepower t h
a n  the primary trainer. And, again, 
we went through the same procedures 
of landings, take-o
ffs, short field 
landings. Just learning the basics with amore powerful aircraft.
 
Q:What was that s t e p -u p  lik e, tost
ep upfrom t h e  b i -p l a n e  into that 
monoplane? Was it a h u g e experience?
 
A:Oh, y e a h .  Itwas more p o w e r f u l  andyou w e r e  e n c l o s e d  inthe c o c k p i t .  You 
had more c o n t r o l s . Itwas -- it was n i c e .
  You t h o ugh t  you were o n  your way to 
being agreat pilot.
 
Q: You enjoyed it?
 
A: I enjoyed it. I enjoyed flying very mu ch.
 
Q: You finish up there, then what?
 

A:Then Iwent toadvanced  training.
 
Q: Okay. Where was that?
 
A: I think I went to (? Mo l t a ?) ,  Georgia -- I  t h i n k  one was Macon -- did I say  
Macon?
 
Q: Yes, Macon.
 
A: M a c o n ,  and then I went to ( ? M o l t a ? ) ,   G e o r g i a ,  and we flew AT - 6 s,  w h i ch  
wasthe Texan -- hadanickname,"the Texan."Again,moreadvanced, mor e  
c o n t ro l s , r e t r a c t a b l e  g ear.Wehad flap s.Weh a d -- eachone b ecamea littlebit 
more of achallenge. But it was not like
 l e a r n i n g  everything at once. From 
p r imary  tob a sic t o  a d v a n c e d , each a i r c r a
f t  was a littl e  bit m o r e c o m p l e x . And 
wedid --Ithink it was the f i r s t  time Idid anight flight. Upto that we h a d  

n e v e r  done anyn i g h t  f l y i n g .  Andinall 
t h e s e  flying schools wedidallkinds of 
manoeuvres. We learned instrument flying. Put a -- had a hood put over 

our h e a d s so we see n o t h i ng  but t h e c o n t r o l s inf r on t of us.Andthei n s t r u c t o r  

w a s  stillwithus,hecould 
see what wewere d o i ng .
 
Q: R i g h t .
 
A: Yeah. So we learned instrument flyi
ng w h e r e  you've got to rely on your 
i n s t ru m e n t s .  You c a n  getvery d i s o r i en te d .  Ifyoudosome m a n o e u v re s , your 

ear k i c k s off and you --s o m e t i m e s  you c a n 't see a n y t h i n g .  You do n 't  know if 
you'reright s i d e up, s i d e w a y s ,  you don't know if you're l o s i n g altitud e or 
g a in ing  a l t i t u d e . Soeachstepa l
ong thewayb
ecame more co mp lex .
 
Q:Was it f r i g h t e n i n g ?  Flying b l in d ,  you know,with that hood over?
 
A:It -- Id i d n 't  f ind it d i f f i c u l t .  We had s o m e  time in Link T r a i n e r s . Do you 

know what a L i n k  Trainer is?
 
Q: N o .
 
A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary po sition where I'm in 
t h e r e ,  y o u ' r e t e l l i n g mewhattodo,a
nd you have a_sh ow i ng m e  what I'm d o i n g  
inthe a i r c r a f t .  It's away t o  learn blind flying without bein g inan aircraft.
 
He'd  b a s i c a l l y  tell you what todoand y o
u'd d o it.Andyou're just looking at-- 
yougotto r e l y on i n s t r u m e n t s ,  you c an't  r ely on your ear a n d st u f f lik ethat  

when you're learning to fly. Y o u  got 
to believe the altimeter, the artificial 
h o r i z o n ,  the RPMs t h at the m o t o r ' s  -- 
you got t o  r e ly onyour i n s t r u m e n t s  
because youcan 't a l w a y s  see the g r ound.
 
Q: R i g h t .
 

A: Yeah.
 
Q:Sothroughout thisentire process fro
m b a s i c  training, toAvon, togoing to 
Macon,togoing o n to the AT-6, blind co
ckpit training, what h a v e you, what 
length of time are we talking abouthere,thisentire time?
 
A: Two-month intervals.
 
Q: They'r e  c r a mmi ng  a lot into a short period o f  time.
 
A: Oh, y eah . I went from not f l y i ng  to six m o n t h s  later I'm a p i lo t.

A: It was s c a r y .  B e ca u s e  when you put t h e  th r o
ttle forward, theairp lan e  moved 
and it w a s  very m a n o e u v r a b l e ,  but -- Id o n 't  k n o w ,  it w a s  e x i t i n g .  It got your 
blood going like mad.

W h e r e  do you go? W h a t  do you do?
 
A: I went down to Tallahassee, Florida and l e a r n e d  I was going to fly P-47s.
 
Q: What did you t h i n k ?
 
A:Oh, it was great. Imean this was a b i g  aircraft. It was --ithad more

you l e a r n  w h e r e  all the i n s t r u m e n t s  are, y

Q:From the time  that you we

Europe, presumably,howlongwas that?
 
A: Oh, go ll y .  I was fl ying the P-47 in N o v e mb e r ,  I went o v e r s e a s  in D e c e mb e r .  
So Ihad ma ybe  two months training in the P-47 before I w e n t  overseas.
 
Q:How did you get o v e r s e a s ?
 
A: S h i p .  B o a t .
 
Q:W h e r e  did you a r r i v e  in E u r o p e ?
 
A:Well, f i rst ofall, after If i n i s h e d  m y
 training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I 
g o t  married then.Imeanwe
 were m a r r i e d  in N o v e m b e r . And one n i gh t  Id i dn 't  
come home for dinner and she knew Iwas going out. Inever said good-bye to 
her. Mygear was all atthe 
ba se and t h e y  c l o s e d  down the b a se .  Igot at r a i n  up 
to B o s t o n  and aboat toE n g l a n d  and sh e '
s sitting i n Ta llahassee waiting forme 

tocome home f o r dinner. And she knew Iwas going ov er se a s  b e c a u s e  all 
my gear was on the base, so...
 
Q:Were yout r y i ng  tosp a r e  her thepain o f  s e p a r a t i o n ?
 
A:No, she knew Iwas going to l e av e .
 
Q: Y e s .
 
A:Imean Ithink during Wo rld WarIIall t h e  wives knew that their --intheair 

corp --w e r e  going to leave. They didn
't knowwhen, but it'sgoing to ha pp en .
 

Q:Sure, but why did you c
hoose  to do it in t h a t  f a sh io n ,  not come home for 
dinner that night?
 
A: I felt bad because I co u ldn 't say g o o d -by e t o  her.
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A:Ic o u l dn 't  make aphone call. They just c l o s e d  down the base, put usonthe 
t r a i n  and wewere o n  our way to E n g l a n d .
 
Q:So it really  w a sn 't your c h o i c e ,  you were s o r t  of --
 
A:Itwas not our c h oi c e ,  no. Ididn't  know 
i f Iwas going to go to eastern -- or to 
Japan or t o  England. Iwent to England.
 
Q:How did you e x p l a i n  it to your w i f e ?  Did y o u wr i t e  her a l e t t e r ?
 
A: Ev en tua l l y  I let her know, when I got t o  England and could write. 
C o mmu n ic a t i o n  was b a d  during World War II. It took along time. S h e  really 

h a rd ly  ever got your letter because if y o u wroteyourwifeitwasp h o t o g r a p h e d ,  

16mm film,went back tothe S t ates, a
nd it was p r i n t e d  out o n
 what they call V -
M a i l ,  have you h e a r d  of V - M a i l ?
 
Q: Absolutely.
 
A: So she gets a littl e 4 x 6 copy of the l e t t e r  that you w r o t e, so ...
 
Q:That was sothat the sensors could have al o o k  at it.
 
A:Yeah. Right. They looked atit, it w a s  p hotogr a phed ,  blocked out any 

r e f e r e n c e  to w h e r e  youwere inE n g l a n d ,  andsh e 'd  get a l i t t l e  p h o t o c o p y  of 
your letters.
 
Q:How long did it take 
you to get to E n g l a n d ?
 
A:Ithink ittook p r o b a b l y  seven days or
 so. I t  was aslow trip. Went ov er by 
boat.Ithink i t was the EMPRESS OF AUS
TRALIA or something like that.It 
waspretty  nice ride over becau
se a s  o fficers wehadani
ce s t ateroo

n i c e  dining room, we had atable, wehad tablecloths.And itwas atroop ship, 

and alot ofthe t r o o p s  were down in
 the hold under t e r r i b l e conditions,I 
thought. Ifound that being anofficer 
had alot of priv ileges. It was amazing, 
you k now.
 
Q: W h e r e  p r e c i s e l y  in En g l a nd did you l a n d ?
 
A: I landed, actually, in Scotland
. I think welandedat Liverpool.
 
Q: O k a y .
 

A: Yeah. Landed in Liverpool.I went over as a replacement pilot. I did not 
train for t h e  squadron or 
a group, I went over to England as a replacement pilot 
and didn't  know where I w o u l d be.Sowe 
went into this pool of p i lo t s . And they 
said , " O k a y ,  wen eed two f i g h t e r  p i l o t s  for E u r o p e ,  wen eed  fo u r  for t h e r e , "  and 
you j u s t  sort ofp i c k e d  out w h e r e  you w a n t e d  to go. A n d Ihad ab u ddy  that I 
trained with, andwe w e n t  over toE
ngland tog e the r ,  andwefound that t h e  

353rd Fighter Group only ne
eded two v e r s u s somebody else that needed six or 
so. S o wefigured the guys that n e e d ed  th
eleast p i l o t s  were p r o b a b l y  b e t t e r ,  so 
wechose that f i g h t e r  group togo with. Wehada choice.
 
Q: R i g h t .
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q:Sowhere exactly --which squadron were you with? Where did 
you end up?
 
A:Isigned up to go to the 353rd Fi

in the 350th Fighter 
Squad.
 
Q:Which airforce was that? Wasthat Ninth A i r  Force? Which air force?
 
A: E i g h t h .
 
Q: E i g h t h  A i r  F o r c e ?
 
A:Eighth Air Force. So the one we 
picked  out w a s  the353rd Fighter Group

Squ a d r on . Thefighter group had t h r e e  sq
uadrons to it, it had the 350th, 351st 
a n d  352nd, and we were a ssi g n e d  to 
the 350th F i g h t e r  Group. This was the P-
47.
 
Q: Right, the Thunderbolt.
 
A: Thunderbolt Group.
 
Q:What ci t y ?  Doyour e m e m b e r  what town o r  v i l l a g e  youwere s t a t i o n e d  out 
of?
 
A: The fir s t base I went to we didn't  stay
 t h e r e  very long, but Iended upinatown 
called R aydo n ,  R - A - Y - D - O - N .  It was in the eastern area o f  E n g l an d, in the 

East Anglia area ofGreat B r itain .
 
Q:What did you t h i n k  of E n g l a n d ?
 
A:Didn't  see any of it. Ime an atthat 
ti me. We just took a train, we got off at 
this town o f  R a y d o n  and went ontoabase.
 

Q:And did you sp en d  most
 ofyour time  when 
you were not inthe aircraft on that 
base or...
 
A:Yes. Y e s. Oh, wedid get l e a v e .  We 
did g o into Lon don  and st u f f  like that 
on a f e w occasions.
 
Q:What was your sense ofhow th
e English p e o p l e  acce
p t ed you or your 
interaction with them?
 
A: I had b a s i c a l l y  no co n t a c t  with t h
em.O n leave -- I only was on leave a 
couple times a n d wentinto London.An
d London was strange b e c a u s e  itwas a 
blackedout city.Youweretherewith alittle tiny flashlight, theyhad alittle 
(?slit?), that 
you d i dn 't  bump into p e op le  g o i n g a r o und the t o wn . Foodwas 
scarce in England a t  the time. I did 
know afamil y  in E n g l a n d  through Boy 
S c o u t s.  As aBoy Scout we used t o  sponsor -- or we used to go up to C a n a d a  
a n d visit --sort ofanexch ange  with Boy Scouts, a n d  when Iwent uptoCanada 
thisfamilyhada fa mi ly in Englandwho I contacted and hadoccasion tovisit 

them. Weused totake them some f
ood i t e m s  scr o ung ed  fromourbasebecause 
they were l i m i t e d inwhat they co u ld  
buy. Food was scarce i n  England. Itwas 
pretty much r a t i o n e d .
 
Q:What was your job asa 
pilot with the 350th?What
 were you ta
sked with 
doing?
 
A: Whatever the mission was. First of all,
 when Ijoined t h e  350th, that was in 
Janu ary ,  Ireally didn't get t o  fly my
 first mission until almost March b e c a u s e  
this fighter group wanted to
 t r a i n  new r e c r u i t s  o n  how they did t h i n g s ,  how they 
flew f o r m a t i o n ,  h o w  they a t t a c k e d  s o me
t h i n g  and just  what they did, s o  you 
were comfortable and didn't run 
into e a c h  o th e r in c o m b a t .  So --
 
Q:And what was that few mo n t h s  like for you?
 
A:Itwas f un. Itwas good t r a i n i n g .  We
 did s o m e  dog f i g h t i n g ,  we chased  each 
o th e r, tried t o evade. Just tolearn howto
 do stu f f  as t h i s  g r ou p  did it. So -- and 
after that then I f l e w  first miss ion .
 
Q:And what --Iwan t you totell meall a
bout that. What was the first mission 
like? When was it, precisely?
 
A: The first missio n ,  if I recall -- I w e n t
 ov erseas inJan u a
ry , first part of 
January,Ididn't  fly myfirst mission until
, I think, March. Thebiggest thing I 

r e m e m b er isIw a s  breath in g  hard becau
se I had never seen t h e s e littleblack 
puffs co ming  upinto thesky, t h e  flack.
 
Q: Y e s .
 

A: And I found that I got pretty low 
onoxygen,because I must have been 
breath ing very, veryhard.Itwass
cary but exiting. And 
it w a s un ev en tfu l . 
Itwas just sort ofamilk run 
o r  escorting bombers into Germany.
 
Q:What sort ofbombers
 were they? 
Do you 
r ecall ?
 
A:Yeah, mo stly all the bombers that we
 escorted were B-17s sometimes B-24s. 
And wecouldn't st a y  with them very 
lo ng.Imean they flew fair ly  s l o w  
co mp ared  to us.Sothey'd  beflying alon
g a n d we'd  bejust sort ofz i g z ag g i n g  
because itwas _+getahead of them. So
wecould only stay w i t h  them for 
maybe 15, 20 minutes before a n o t h e r squa
dron would come intotake over and 
e s c o r t  themalittle bit further. Somostall o u r  missions intheb e g inning  were 
e s c o r t  m i s s i o n s , higha l t i t u d e ,  28 -30,000 feet, e s c o r t i n g bo mb e r s. Someof 

our missions later ran into th e area we
re low-altitude missions where we'd go 
in and dive bomb abridge, dive bomb atunnel,  shootupatrain, whatever our 

mission was. But most of them --probably I'd say 60, 70percent were escort 

missions and some were just "let's go 
in and target of 
opportunity." You see 
so m e t h i n g  moving,trytostopitfrom moving.Yeah.
 
Q: Do you r e c a l l  your f i r s t  c o m b a t  e n g a g e m e n t ?
 
A: I only had one.
 
Q: O k a y .
 
A:The day Iwas sh o t  d o w n . Ia c t u a l l y  w e n t  t h r o u g h  55 ... 5 5  m i s s i o n s ,  

so me th ing like that, and never t a n g l e d with anyone.Theywereallescortsor 

d i v e  bombing mi ssion s withnoopposition at
 all. I t  wasn't until after D-Day 
that westarted tangling with things.
 
Q:Tell usa b ou t  the day you were shot dow
n. D o  you r e m e m b e r  the day? Do you 
remember what month itwas?  The year?
 
A:Yeah. The i n v a s i o n  was onJune 6, th
at's w h e n  D-Day was. Iflew three 
missions on D-Day, mo st ly  just trying to shoot up anything that was moving, 

targets of opportunity. They were landi
ng on t h e  beachhead.  I flew early 
mo rning -- it was dark --probably th
ree missio n s  on D-Day. Goover, c o m e  
back, refuel, goover and try tostop convoy coming into the front, this type of 

thing. T h a t  was on June 6th. And Ifl
ew anumber of mi s s i o n s  inbetween 
there. And on June 12 is when Iwas s h o t  down. We were, again, looking for 
targets o f opportunity on thegroundand actually sawn o enemy aircraft.They 
were just s c a r c e .  So t h e y  were just lik
e milk runs. AndJune 12th, out o f  the 
blue came p rob ab ly  30ME-109s, and out oft h e  16aircraft they shot down 12of 

us.Imean youcouldn't turn anywhere without having a 109 on 
your tail, you 

know. Fired atacouple of th em,didnotbring them down. Gotafew bits, 
that'sabout it.Scared. Ireally gothit badly.
 
Q:And you were going down?
 
A:Yeah, Ibailed out. Aircraft caugh t fire.
 
Q:Right. What was that experience like?
 
A:Itwas pretty natural. Ididn't give a second thought ofgoing over the side. I 

mean if a n  airplane's not flying and I'm init, Idon't w a n t  tobe in.
 
Q: S u r e .
 
A:You know.And my squadron leader was shot down and he said, "I'm going 
away," andhedied, h e crashed onthe-- 
hejust hit the deck. And t h e y  shot down 
an u m b e r  of us. And now I'm in af o r e
ign country, I'm in France. I'm not 
q u i t e  sure where in France I am but I knew I was on t h e  ground, you know.
 
Q: Do you recall what altitude 
you were -- r
oughly  whataltitude 
you were when 
you b a i l e d out?
 
A:Iwasprobably 1,400 feet, 1,600 feet
. T h e  chute opened and Ihit the deck. I 
just went o v e r  the edge and pu lled  th
e cord. Iwasinthea i r verylittle 
before Ihit the g r o und .
 
Q:W h e r e  were you when you hit th
e g r o u n d ?  In af i e l d ,  ina --
 
A: I l a n d ed  in a f i e l d ,  in a far m a r e a .  Did t h e  best to -- not bury my chu t e  but 

keep itu n d e r  some b r u s h ,  and b e f o r e  
too long there was a f a i r  few Germans 
looking for me, and I just laid  l o w andhopedIwasn't caught.HadtheGermans 

had any dogs with them I'd ofprobably 
been c a p t u r e d then,but
 they did not f ind 
me .
 
Q: W h e r e  did you h i d e ?
 
A: P a r d o n ?
 
Q: W h e r e  did you h i d e ?
 
A: I just hid on the ground in some brush area. I could see them looking for me 
but they didn't get near where I was.
 
Q:How long did that p r o c e ss t ake wh
en they w e r e  l o ok
i n g  for you when you 
were lying down?
 
A: P r o b a b ly  a cou p l e of hou rs I saw them in t h e  area and they  d i s a p p e a r e d .
 

Q:C o u l d  you hear them? C o ul d  you hear t h e m  sp e a k i n g ?
 
A:No. No, Ic o u l d  no t. No.
 
Q:But you could hear them mo ving about?
 
A:Other than they were looking for mea
nd t h e y  didn't find meand Ijust stayed 
low and tried t o  stay under cover.
 
Q:When did you move from that p o s i t i o n ?
 
A: During the night. During
 thenight Ileft t h e  p o sition. Ihadapretty good 
ideaofwhereIw a s and I just headed 
towards where I thought t h e b eachh e ad  
was. This was just six days a f t e r  t h
e  landing on D-Day. SoIwas b a sic a l ly  
going west.We had a-- we carried an escape kit with us w h i c h  had aco mp ass, 
had some pills for -- I've b l a n k e d  on that word -- p u r i fy in g  w a ter. We had 

m o r p h i n e  whichwecould inject.Hadwe
 been wounded b a d l y  we could inject 
ourselves with mo rphine. We had so
me maps, we had some phrase books, 
we had so m e money ofthe area that wewere flying over. So Ijust headed 
towards the beachhead.
 
Q:With the ide a that
 you were h e a d i n g s  t o w a r d s  A m e r i c a n  f o r c e s ?
 
A: R i g h t .  R i g h t .  Y e a h .
 
Q: What happened next?
 
A: What h a p p e n e d  ne x t ,  I saw a f a r m e r  in the f i e l d  and went up to him and in my 
broken French It o l d  him Iwas an A m e r i c a n  pilo t and if hewould h e l p me. And 
he was scared, but he did. He got me  some civilian clothes. He got me some 

food. H e  got mesome maps ofthe area
. Hedid not t h i n k I 
had enough mon ey ,  
sohef i n a l l y gavem e 500 f r a n c s  or so me t h i n g ,  b ec a u se  the cost o f l i v i n g in 
France wasfairly high, andsent me o n  my way.
 
Q: W h e r e  did you go?
 
A: I starte d towards -- I kept going west
 a n d  app ro a ch ed  another farmer that 
took meinto a t o w n  and put meincontact
 with themayor ofthis town.Hegot 
me some papers. InEngland we carried
 o u r photographsin
 civilian clothes 
befo re.Westarted flying missions wewerephotographed in  civilian clothes that 

we could put on any sort o f  papers that we might need if we were shot down.
 
And he got me some  p a p e r s  and took me
 to a f a r m  wh ere I stayed for two 
months. Istayed  on th i s  farm hoping toget into Switzerland orget in to Spain. 
It was German o c cu p i ed , German s o l d i e r s

Q:And they p r o v i d e d  food for you a n d . . .
 
A:Food, yeah. And t h e n ,  as the G e r m a n

A:They were not inu n i f o r m s .  They --

point. I didn't know what wa

Q:The doors open up, where are you?
 
A:When they op en ed  up--well, they o p en ed  up acouple oftimes toletus 
reliev e  o u r s e l v e s  on t h e  way.  When they f i n a l l y  op en ed  upwewere i n  
B u ch enw ald  con cen tration  camp.
 
Q: How do you k now ?
 
A:Ithink some knew where we were. 
We though twhenth
edoors would open 
we would be in a P O W  camp, except 
I knew POWs didn't  have s t r i p e d  
uniforms, were not e m a c i a t e d.  They were l i k e  walking ghosts. And wejust 
knew wewere i n  B u c h enw a l d  but
 we didn't  know too much a
bout Buchenwald. 
I didn't hear about c o n c e n t r a t i o n  camps when I was growing up. I didn't know 

w h a t  they were like. And they were ba
d places. A n d  these prisoners were all-- 
well, they were Jews,gypsies, homose
xuals, wh a t ev e r  Germanydidn't w a n t  
went into aconcentration camp. And 
they str i pped uscompletelynaked, 
shaved every hair off o u r body,dousedus
with disinfectan t, gave usa shirt and 
apair ofpants --wasprobably from somebody whodied, they were civilian-

t y p e  c lo t he s--we had no sh o e s ,  no so c k s ,  and we sl e p t  o u t s i d e , just on the 

ground forp r ob ab ly  five orsix days.An
d this was in O c tob er. Itwas getting 
p r e t t y  cold.Wef i n a l l y did 
get into ab a r r ack  t y p e  th
ing and we slept on these 
shelves andthey h a d  four tiers high and 
p r o b a b l y  f i v e  men on a s h e l f .  I l o st  68 
pounds intheconcentration 
camp. Y o u  gotaslice ofbread inthemorning, we 

got alittl e bit of watery  soup, and you 
got c o f f e e, may b e  aslice ofb r ead  at 
night. Wewere p r e t ty much bitten byfl
eas and lice. Itwas --B u ch enw a ld  was 
a horrible place. I know
 you'v e probablybeentoth
e Holy Cross Mu seum. It-- 
i t  was bad .Wewere 
there until Nov e mber.
 
Q:You sai d  when you a r r i v e
d  you knew it was not aPOW c a m p .
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: What did you th ink it was? Where did you thinkŠ
 
A: I had no idea, except all th ese guys were
i n sort of grey and black striped 
suits, they w e r e likewalking ghosts.Wedidn'tknowwh ere w e were.Wedid 
very quickly know that wewere in a 
c o n c e n t r a t io n  camp, but Ididn't know what 
a c o n c e n t r a t i o n  camp was. I w a sn 't  a l o n e ,  t h e r e  w a s  168 of us that were p i c k e d  

upinone day in P a r i s . They just sw e p
t through thecity. They knew w h e r e  they 
were and they just d ecid e d  topick us
 all up.We were Americans, British, 
Australian, New Zealanders. All airmen
, some officers,non
-comms. Alltrying 
to evade cap tu r e, and t h e y  picked us all up in one day in P a ris.
 
Q:When you identified that you had other allied servicemen with you in the 
camp,  did youdo 
yourbest tostay with them ordid 
you -- what was t h a t  like?
 
A:Well, they kept us t o g e t h e r .  Yeah. We w e r e  to g e t h e r .  Wewere a l w a y s  
t o g e t h e r .  We d i dn 'ttalk to each o th e r very much becau se we r e a l l y d i d n 't 
know ifthere was aspy planted in among us. Because wedidn't 
know each 
other. We w e r e onlyjust --Ithink some oftheairmen knew e a c h  other, some of 
the Brit s p r o b a b l y  did. A n d wejust stuc
k t oge th er  asagroup, tried toact a s  a 
military unit.
 
Q:Ex p l ain th at. What doyou mean by 
"tried to act like amilitary unit"?
 
A:We tried to stay to g e th er .  We tried to s t a n d  at atten t ion . We tried to act like 

soldiers. A n d  just weekly Ithink wehad formations. We t r i e d to just act 

like so ld ie r s  should rather t h a n wanderaroundthecamptryingtosteal 

somebody's shoes or something like that. It
 was a-- we w e r e  apretty mo tley 
crew atthis point. AsI say,there was 
168 of us, soweall spoke English.And 
that was the other thing,language isa 
terrib l e barrier.Andtherew e re Poles, 
there was some Germans or some F r ench
,there were some D an i sh , there were 
all kinds of people, gypsies. All men, 
t h e r e ' s  now o m e n  t h e r e . T h e y didh a v e  
some women inparts ofthe camp,some c h i l dr en  inparts ofthe camp. Itwas 

ah o rrib l e exp e rien ce because wedidfind 
o u t  shortly before 
we were moved to 
aPOW camp that w e were scheduled toget executed. Wejust missed it byafew 
days.  When wegot th ere they said t h
e  only way out was 
up the c h i m n e y   _+.
 

Q:Did you know that they we re m u r d e r i n g  p e o p l e ?
 
A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
 
Q:How did they goabout doing that? Did you witness?
 
A:Idid not, no. Isaw some people that w e r e  hung. Isaw some people who 
were p r e t t y  m u c h  beaten to d e a t h .  Ifth
ey  went into a_wedidn'tknow, we were 
just a separate Eng l i s h - spe a kinggroupof people.Wewereinone area.
 
Q:And why were the y  b e i n g  hung? Why 
were t h e y beingbeatento death? 
Were these i n f r a c t io n s  o f  the rules or --
 
A:Infractions. Theconcen tration camp w a s guarded by prisoners. There were 
some p r e t t y  m e a n  p r i s o n e r s  who got e x t r a  r a t i o n s ,  they got e x t r a  b e n e f i t s  by 
keeping the prisoners in order, andthey 
would not hesitate tobeat somebody to 
d e a t h . C o n c e n t r a t i o n  camp  was ju st --saw v e ry  few -- s a w  v e ry  few G e r m a n  
guards orany th ing, theywere a l l  ci
vilian guards. They were called "kapos."
 
Iguessit'ssome name, probably is an
 abbreviation for something, wh atever 
this w o rd  "kapo" was. But itwas just abad place.
 
Q:You sai d  t h e r e  were c h i l d r e n  and 
women there.What were they doing 
there? Were they the w i v e s  andc h i l d r en  ofsome ofthea d m i n i s t ra t i o n  of t h e  

camp? What were th ey d o in g  t h e r e ?
 
A:Ithink they were prisoners. Ithink they w e re  prisoners. They were in 

sep arate areas.
 
Q: I s e e .
 
A:So some times you'd see them being t r a n s p o r t e d  to one part of the camp. 
The camp was sort o f  segregated into
 various groups of people. S o m e  may 
have been ch ild r en . There were some w o m e n  prisoners there. There were 
some ch ild ren.T h e childrenweretrea
ted pretty nicely. Ididn't s e e  underfed 
c h i l d r e n . And not alot of c h i l d r e n , you'd  just see them on o c c a s i o n .
 
Q:Were you made to wo rk ?
 
A:Onone occasion.  Therewasanairstrike --Buchen wald  was next door to a 

small factorya n d there was 
an air s t r i k e  and the f a c t o r y  was h i t andt h ey mad e  
uspick upfire dama ge, carry a w a y  some ofthe debris. And Ithink wemaybe 

did i t  for s o m e t h i n g  to do. Wed i dn 't  wo
rk very hard.Some ofuscarried  the 
stuff out, some c a rri ed i t  back in, toma
ke itlook like wewere busy. B u t  they 
did force ustosupposedly wo rk. And t h a t  only went on for afew days.

 The air s t r i k e  d i d  not hit any of the p r i s o n e r s .  I t h i n k  t h e r e  w e r e  a few 

Germans killed intheair stri k e . That's a s  
close as Iwant to be
 to an air strik e, 
air r a i d .
 
Q: It's frightening?
 
A:Yeah. Y eah . Bomb s make alo
t of noise w h e n  they go off.
 
Q: S u r e .
 
A:Itwas alittle bit away from our camp, w h e r e  we were, so...
 
Q:Didyoueveri d e n t i f y y o u r s e l f --kn ow i n g  t h a t it was not a POW c a m p ,  did 
you ever i d e n t i f y y o u r s e l f  as an A m e r i c a n  p i l o t ,  as an A m e r i c a n a i r m a n  --
 
A: I think we all did, yes. I think they 
d i d  know.Becausewewerecla ssified as 
POWs, I think, in French prison in Pa
ris.Butwhen th ey evacuated Paris we 
were just now p o l i tic a l prisoners.Theydeclared uspolitical prisoners. 

Concentration camp, Idon't think they car
e w h a t  we were. Wewere p r i s o n e r s ,  
p e r i od .  AsI say,they did have ussch e dul e d  tobe ex e c u t ed .
 
Q:Itmay sound like anabsurd q u e s t i o n
,  but d i d  you make any f r i e n d s  in camp?
 
A: Any f r i e n d s ?
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
 
A: Not really. I made a few A m erican  fri
ends.Some I stayed in contact with 
for quite a f e w periodof years.  There'snotverymanyofus l e f t any 

mo r e .  Over168s t r o n g ,  w e 'r e  p r o b a b l y
 d o w n  less than 20nowa r o u n d  the 
c o un t r y  --or a r o u n d , even, youk n o w ,  A u s t r a l i a ,  E n g l a n d ,  b ec a u se  w e  were all 
together. So...
 
Q:  Was there a lead er?  Was there a single man o r  a couple of men who stood out 

as sort of the group leader?
 
A:There wasanEnglish officer whoou trank ed  u s  andheb e came the l ead er. 
And I c a n 't  r e m e m b e r  his n a me .  I did ha ve
 it w r i t t e n  down, but ... b u t  hehad no 
-- he tried to keep us as a milita
r y  unit.  But once wegot out ofthe 
con c entration  camp into aPOW camp, then
 there were l e a d e r s  there. Whenwe 
got into S t a l a g  III th er e w e r e  some 
h i g h - r a n k in g  o f f i c e r s  that took c h a r g e .
 
Q:When you were atB u ch e n
w a l d  did you try t o  e s c a p e ?
 
A:No. No. Idon't know if you could. It w a
s  prettymuchen clo s ed  inelectrified  
f e n c e s .  A n d  wh e r e  doyou go?  Y o u 'r e  inG e r m a n y  now.
 

Q: R i g h t .
 
A:You don 't have any allies like perhaps in  France. No, we made noattemp t to 
get out. Ithink that would bea 
death sen t en ce ifyou w e r e  caugh t.
 
Q:When and how were you t r a n s f e r r e d  t o  S t ala g  III?
 
A:AGerman Lu ftw affe officer came in
to camp. A n d  Idon't know what he 
came into camp for, but i t wa
seither aninsp ection teamor something. A n d he 
declared that we were airmen and did not belong inthe concentration camp, we 

belo nged  inthe P O W  camp 
and sh o r t l y a f t e r  that wegot mo v e d out. B u t  itwas a 
German officer that d e c l a r ed  that we w e r e
 notpolitical prison ers, thatwewere 
prisoners of war and belonged in aPOW camp.
 
Q:Why do you sup p o s e  he did t h a t ?
 
A: P a r d o n ?
 
Q:Why do you sup p o s e  he did t h a t ?
 
A:Ithink the fact that hewas aGerman L u ftw a ffe  officer, wewere airmen, he 

was anairman, and h e  just knew what was right.
 
Q:Did you see hi m?
 
A:Yes, wesaw him because 
he walked through t h e  camp.
 
Q:Did you i n t e r a c t  with him?
 
A: No, I did not. Our l e a d e r  may h a v e .  I do n 't  know.
 
Q:How long after heleft the camp were you transferred?
 
A: P r o b a b ly  less than a w
eek. Less than a w e e k  they 
put us on the t r a i n ,  we 
ended up i n Stalag III.
 
Q:Did they tell  you w h e r e  you were g o i ng ?
 
A: N o .
 
Q: What did you t h i n k ?
 
A: Basically we were going to a POW camp. I didn't know which one or where. 

Wewent t h e r e toS t alag  III, came in, were g r eete d  byabu nch  o f  p r i s o n e r s .

And alot of t h e  p r i s o n e r s  had been t h e r e

barracks thatI was in.

you kn ow .
 
Q:Did the Germans at that time treat you properly?
 
A:Yeah, they left us a l o n e .  Oth e r than
 c o u n t i n g  ust w i c e  aday they did not 
b o t h er  usat all.

A:We -- you would get anews report al
mo st daily.There was a clandestine 
radio someplace andw o rd wo

 the war was going, y o u  
know. Where this radio was Ihad no idea.
T h e s e old-time prisoners were pretty 
innovative of w h attheydidandwhere 
they hid the stuff. B e c a u s e Ithink itwas 
disassembled everytime andput i n  various
 parts ofthe b a rrack s. But we'd get 
anews r e p o r t ,  y e ah . Wep r etty  much knew what w a s go ing  on.
