 
INTERVIEW WITH DR . ROBERT GRUBER
 
 
JUNE 16, 1992
 
 
POTOMAC, MARYLAND
 
 
 

The date is June 16, 1992 and we a re speaking with Dr. Robert Gruber  

in Potomac, Mary land.  Dr. Gruber, could you ple ase tell me your  

name, your date of birth, your place of birth and anything you 

possibly can abou t your childhood.
 
 

My name is Rober t  Gruber and my  da te of birth is  De cember 6, 1933. 

Place of birth, Kosice, Czechosl ovakia.  I remem ber very little 

from before the  a ge of about five.   One of my first  vivid memories  

is, in fact,  conn ected with the  ev ents of the perse cutions.  I was 

born in a relati vely large, for that area of the  world, city in 

eastern Czechoslo vakia, Kosice.  A nd in
 
1938  when Hitler took ov er  
Czechoslovakia, K osice was given  o ver to the Hungar ians and within  

a very short time, the Hungarians came in.  One of my first memories 

is, in fact, bei ng in the main s treet in Kosice and watching the  

Hungarian victory  parade with the leader of the Hungarians, Admiral 

Horthy, on a whi te horse leading  a column of Hun garian soldiers 

down the main str eet.  This all l ooked pretty glam orous to me bu t 

within a couple o f days, the rule  came down that a l l Jews who were 

not Hungarian cit izens, which our family was not, had to leave that 

area that the  Hun garians took ov er  within 48  hours.   So that's one 

of my first memor ies.  Now one int eresting thing is in terms of the 

background might  be that this  enti re section of  Cze choslovakia did 

have
 
a fair numb er of Jews.  The y were pretty mu ch all orthodox,  
although not
--
Has idism was not ver y much, ve ry popu lar in tha t area.   

It was more, Iguess, intellectually orthodox, elastic type of 

orthodoxy, rather  than the  more  em otional Hasidic  o rthodoxy.  
But, 

you know, things  were very much different that t hey are here now 

and during that time arranged ma rriages were sti ll very much in 

practice.  So tha t my parents were  actually marri ed  as a res ult of 

a get
-
together that was arranged  and paid for by  a prof
essional 
matchmaker.  My f ather received a dowry which was s till traditional  

in those days.  But, of course, I didn't
--
wasn't  alive then so I  

didn't know much  about it but it's part of the lore that I have 

learned.
 

 

Were both of your  parents from tha t area
? 

 

Not too far from that area, probably about...Act ually my mother 

was from a town  somewhat smaller city, town called Michalovce and  

 
 
 
 
2
 
I'll refer to it  again later on in the story, wh ich was probably  
about 40, 50, 60  miles from  Kosi ce.  My fathe r h ad a much  more  

complicated hist ory.  He was born in eastern
--
in Ruthenia 

(ph)(c.36) actual ly, eastern Ruthenia and became orphaned when he 

was fourteen years old during the time of the first World War.  

Spent some very difficult years in Budapest and then eventual
ly 

drifted over to Czechoslovakia a s a result of one of his older 

brothers having established himsel f in that area. He opened up a 

jewelry shop in  K osice.  My mother  did not l ive in Kosice then but  

this matchmaker knew of this person in Kosice looking for
 
a 
prospective bride .  And he hooked  them up  togethe r.  After th ey  

married, they  did  settle i n Kosice  at that  time.  But as I  say, I  

remember very  lit tle of the years  in Kosice.  The
--
I guess I didn't  
say that my init ial language tha t I learned was Hungarian.  That 

was my mother tongue even though I was born in Czechoslovakia  

because that  was  the part of Cz e choslovakia which  was ethnica lly 

very Hungarian.   Also this area, n ot too long befor e, had been par t  

of the Austrian
-
H ungarian empire.  And I think J ews, in particular, 
tended to identi fy more with the  Hungarian peopl e than with the 

Slovakia people. So that, you kno w, my mother who had gone to of 

course, schools  still under the Austrian
-
Hunga rian empire
--but 
that's what sh e s poke fluently and  perfectly. 
 
So a ctually, as fa r 
as I know, I did n't learn to spea k Slovakian until  I began schoo l  

at the age of s ix.  But I don't remember havin g any particular 

difficulty learni ng then.  So let  me kind  of pick  up the  story a  

little bit after  we got to Michalo vce because when we were asked  to 

leave within 48 hours, the place my parents chose to go to was my 

mother's hometown  which was  Michalovce which was  still part of 

Czechoslovakia th at was on its  las t legs at  that  po int.  And,  let's  

see...
 

 

You got to Michal ovce.
 

 

Yes, we got to Michalovce and that's where I begin to have my first 

memories that a re  fairly vivid and  fairly clear.   For
--initially 

for, I guess, the first year or so, we couldn't find a place to  

live so we live d with my mothe r's family, with  her sister
 
and  
brother
-
in
-
law in  fairly crowded c ircumstances.  As  I remember, and  
only very vaguely , I began  to
--
eve n before I  starte d regular school,  

I had already s ta rted Cheder which  one usually be ga n at the age of 

four or five. Le t's see what else  can I remember a bout that time?
 
 

Had--
did your fat her found work th ere?
 

 
 
 
 
3
 
 
Well, that's part of the story and one thing that'll become clear 

as I tell  this st ory is that  the  w ay we surviv ed wa s because of  a 

great deal of lu ck, really, and circumstances tha t kind of came 

together in just the right way.F or example, my father who was a  

jeweler and a  jew elry manufacturer  rather than  a st ore owner, he
--

when we moved to  Slovakia, he co uld not...  He wanted to open a 

shop there but  he  couldn't because  by that tim e Cze choslovakia had  

broken up, Slova k ia had become  an independent fasci st
 
republic and  
because he was no t a citizen
--
in f act he had always  been stateless, 

my father had never had citizenship with any country.Because he  

was not a citi zen , he was not  able  to get a  license  to open a  shop.  

So after a while,  after struggling  around for a wh ile, he came u p  

with the idea of getting a partner who was a citizen with whom he 

would jointly ope n a shop.And h e happened to find a jeweler who 

was a Christian person who was alcoholic and not really that 

interested in run ning the shop as long as he was  fa irly adequately  

provided for.  So  the shop that  m y father opened  w as really under 

his name, legally  belonged to h im and what makes  th at important is  

that because  of t hat, when  later o n all Je wish busi nesses and  stores  

were taken over,  were Aryranized a s it was c alled at that time,  and 

a very good depiction of that is in the movie, 
The Shop on Main  

Street,
 
the Aryan ization
.  Whe n al l the stores were  Aryanized, this 
did not apply to my father's shop because it was not a shop 

officially owned  by
 
a Jewish  perso n.  So my father was able during 
some of these difficult years to continue to make money which, as 

the story will  en fold, became a lso  very importan t f or our surviva l.  

But this was a totally sort of com bination of circu mstances that he 

had not p lanned o n.  He planned,  h e wanted to be  ab le to ope n his  

own shop but bec ause of these ci rcumstances he w asn't able to do 

so.So then gra dually, I guess, he established himself with this 

new partner and  w e started, let's  see, '39, '40.  B y that time, 
as 

soon as I th ink S lovakia became
--
v ery shortly after  they became an  

independent fasci st republic, they started passing some laws against 

the Jews.  And I  don't kn ow exact ly the or der of  t hem, but it was  

laws like
--
 
you know, one day the law would be that
 
no Jews could 
go into p arks.  S o as a  kid,  you know, there  were parks around, I  

wasn't able to  go  and play in  the parks.  No Jews w ould be allowed  

to go to the mov ies.  This town wasn't that big and we had one  

movie but still i t was a
--
it seeme d like a very exciting, glamorous 

place to go to b ut there was no way I could go t o a movie during  

that time.  The o ther rule was something like no Jews in restaurants 

and that didn't
--
we hadn't gone out in re stauran t
---
didn't seem 

 
 
 
 
4
 
like a depriva tio n.  They didn't h ave any McDona lds , you know  that 
I would have bee n deprived of.  But that gives  y ou some sense  of  

the gradually kin d of eating aw ay at your freedoms  that took place  

during that  time.   I guess what  I  remember and  some what vaguely  but 

pretty much thou gh, is the growi ng sense of fear  and anxiety and 

tension that all  of my family an d all the people  around us about  

what was going to happen.  I mean,
---
clearly, no one expected 

anything good to happen but perhaps at this point no one quite 

anticipated how bad things would  be either.  The n I think by the  

time I started  fi rst grade, no Jew s were allowed  in  regular public 

schools.  So that  essentially unde r the sponsorship  of the Jewi sh  

community, there  was a Jewish  scho ol with exclusiv e ly Jewish kids. 

They--
I think it only went up to 6th grade and after a while that's 

as far as a person could go there, a Jewish person could go in their 

education, was 6t h grade. 
 

 

So, did you origi nally attend the public schools?
 
 

I think by the  ti me I was, let's  s ee, was 1940 I  wa s six years old 

by the time  I wo u ld have star ted f irst grade.  I t hink by that  time 

already, the Jew s were not allowed to go to publ ic schools.  In 

fact this pictur e, 'cause this i s the second gra de, I supposed I 

started in '39, '40.  Now I don't
--
may have started in public school 
but I really d on' t have any rec oll ection of the fir st grade.  But 

by the secon d gra de, as you  can see in the  year 1 94 0
-
41, I was  in 
an all
--
this is my picture
--
I wa s in an all Jew ish school.  In 

fact, at that po int, they were s egregated into b oys and girls in 

different classes .Should I c omme nt on the picture ?
 

 

Yeah, yeah.
 
 

As a matter
--
thi s obviously
--
thi s picture is o f  some interest  

because it does  h ave
--
shows at lea st the teacher  an d principal who  

are pictured alon g with the studen ts.  They wear ye llow bands which 

were at that time  required for Jew s to wear to identify themselves.  

I don't really remember most of the children here in this picture 

so I can't tell you who survived and who didn't for sure.But I 

would guess that since about 6 0 to 70% of  Slovakian  Jews were  killed  

in the Holocaust,  that probably th e same percentage  is true here.  

That about 60 or 70% of these boys that were killed in the Holocaust.  

Interestingly, i ronically enough , the teacher and the principal 

both survived ac tually.  While I'm on the pictur es, I might just  

mention the earli est picture  here is one t aken at  my  aunt's wedding.   

 
 
 
 
5
 
This is my father, this is my mother, this is me and this is my  
sister.  This i s  my mother's  sis ter who was  gett ing married and
 

this is her husba nd, _____ (c.156)  husband, and these are two other 

aunts, sisters of  my mother.  All of these people  w ere killed, all  

except our immedi ate family, in th e Holocaust.
 
 

You would have be en about four yea rs old there?
 
 

In there, I'm pr obably a little younger than tha t.  I think I'm 

probably about  th ree years old.  M y sister is about  four years old.   

I think the we ddi ng actually took  place in Kosice  a lthough my aunt 

was from Michalov ce. 
 

 

Interesting.
 
 

Yeah.  So it w as with these
--
with this aunt and uncle that we lived 

for some period of time when we first moved to M ichalovce.  Now 

maybe you can as k me some questi ons specifically  about the life 

there before I ge t into the
--
more directly into the  story.
 

 

Okay, sure.  Well , after you mo ved  out from livi ng  with your aun t 

and uncle, you go t your own place,  is that...?
 
 

Yeah, we got an apartment.  You know, a reasonable one by the  

standards of th at  place.  In many ways, this whol e area was really  

fairly primitive,  certainly by
--
e ven by today's s tanda
rds there.   

But certainly by American standards, they would have been very 

primitive.  There were very few  c ars in that ar ea,  there was lot s 

of horse
-
drawn  traffic, wagons  and  so on.   There  was even a  vestige  
from the past, in that there was a castle at the edge of town, where 

the count, t he lo cal count li ved.  And when  they w ould go by  in the  

street, they wou ld be in a horse
-
drawn coach wi th their emblem 
there, insignia on the side of t he coach.  So there was
--
it's a  

very agricultural  area, there was
--
at least at that  time.  Now I've 
been on a return trip there a coup le of years ago a nd many of these 

small towns duri ng the communist  era, they had built a lot of  

polluting indust ries and terrible
-
looking moder n cinder block 
housing projects. But in thos e da ys, it was very a gricultural.
 
 

Do you remember w hat the town look ed liked then?
 
 

Yeah, it was  real ly mostly
--
consis ted of one v ery l ong main street  

that stretched fr om the railroad s tation on one end , probably tw o  

 
 
 
 
6
 
or three miles  l ong to the other  end where there  was a cree k and 
beside the creek  was the count's castle.  And then there were a  

couple of street s parallel to th is main street b ut not nearly as 

big or prominent  as this main s treet really.  All the stores,  

essentially, were  on that main st reet.  On that main street, you  

also had the Je wi sh synagogue whic h for a town  of t hat size, which  

was about 15,000  population,  was  a fairly  magnif icent synagogue  

both inside and  o utside.  But on t hat main street  w as a town hall, 

the post office,  main post offic e and all the streets
--
all the 

stores.  A number  of the stores  p robably a majorit y of the store s 

were owned by  Jew s as was t ypical in that area.  Be cause, with the  

exception of very  few Jews, most Jews were not par t of the lande d  

type of work so that owning busine sses and professi ons is what they 

were engaged in.
 
 

You mentioned al so that the Jews  from that area were prominently  

observant. W as y our family, did y ou observe the Sa bbath and..?
 
 

Yes, I think with  very few excepti ons, you know, wi th the exception 

of
 
some rebels wh o longer observed , most people did  observe.  Ther e 
was certainly
--
we  had kosher food and everything.  That was to  be
-

-
that was standard expectation even though my parents, by standards  
of some, were act ually fairly mode rate.  Becaus e in  that
 
area, many 
women still wore  wigs whereas tha t  was not t rue for  my mother.  In 

many households,  practically the only language s poken within the  

household was Yiddish; that was not true in our household.  

Generally, we spoke Hungarian although my parents did speak Yiddish  

to each other wh en they wanted t o keep something  secret from us. 

And we never
--
my sister and I never quite learned it that well 

although we pic ke d it up s ome.  But
--
by the stand ar ds of some  part 

of the Jewish co mmunity, our fam ily would have b een called, you 

know, fairly mode rn, rather than traditional but i t certainly was 

expected that we would have
--
you know, keep kosher and go to shul 

on Saturday morn i ng, my father  and  I, as I  became older and observe  

essentially all the holidays.  S ome of the more religious people  

would go every morning, would go in at 6 o'clock and do two or three 

hours of studying  the Torah or the Talmud before go ing and starting 

their ordinary da y.
 

 

Was there a yeshi va in the town?
 
 

No, there was no yeshiva in town.  But in Slovakia, I forget exactly 

the name of it, but in the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava 

 
 
 
 
7
 
(ph)(c.233) or  Pr esswer, I think t here were some ve ry famous center.   
She was center___ __.
 

 

What about Zionis t activity?
 
 

Now, that's an interesting questio n because again the community was 

so traditional a t that point, th at they really f or the most part 

had very little use for Zionist activities.The be lief was that, 

you know, the day the Messiah came is when one would go back to  

Palestine, and no t before.  There was almost someth ing sacrilegious  

about becoming a  Zionist and try ing to reestabli sh the State of 

Israel before th e return
--
before  the coming of t he Messiah.  And  

so--
but some of the younger peop le did become Zi onists and they 

were looked at somewhat askance by the more traditional view.My  

cousin, actually both my cousins  w ho lived in Micha lovce. who were  

somewhat, who we re five or six y ears actually mo re like eight or 

ten years older than I, they hadboth become involved in Zionism. 

Not only  that but  to
 
the c onsternat ion of t heir pare nts, they  became 
involved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was not only Zionistic but 

leftist and athe i st in those days.   But that was a source of great  

distress and  emb arrassment to  th eir parents,  tha t they we re....  

But pretty generally, as I said,the opinion was that Zionism was 

not consistent wi th good Judaism.  
 
 

I actually worked with a woman who now is an Australian who is from 

Michalovce and wa s very involved,  I know, in t he Zi onist movement.  

Her name was Magd a Hellinger 
(ph)( c.256).
 

 

For all I know, m y mother probably  knows her.
 
 

I know she is ver y.... Her fathe r taught in the s chool.
 

 

My cousin taught in the Jewish sch ool. 
 

 

I believe so, yes .
 

 

The name seems familiar to me.  These teachers, this one is  

Bernstein, that's  Brown.  But i t s ounds like  a fami liar name  to me.
 
 

She would be quit e a bit older tha n you are.
 
 

But she would probably be about
--
well probably younger than my 

mother.But my m other would proba bly have known he r pretty well.
 

 
 
 
 
8
 
 
_____ check, just  
wondering.
 
 

It sounds like a familiar name.
 
 

Yeah, I mean I ha ven't met anyone else from that to wn, so...
 
 

Yeah.
 

 

So okay, do you remember any of the
--
what it was  like to  go to  

school?
 

 

Yeah, I remember. I suppose I re member this even though it was a 

Jewi
sh school, ra ther than a pa rt  of a regular  sc hool.  My memory 

of it, you know, didn't have so much to do, at least initially with 

the fact of its  b eing a Je wish sch ool.  I mean  the  usual st uff of  

looking forward  t o recess and  play ing soccer and  ot her games
 
duri ng 
recess, you know,  struggling with  it to be a good b oy or a bad b oy 

in class. In th ose days
--
certain ly corporal punis hment was still 

very much a part of education in t hose days.  S o the teachers would 

have a bamboo stick and if you misbehaved in class, then you had to 

go and take your  punishment and e xtend out your ha nd and wait fo r  

it to be switch ed  and struck by  th e teacher with th e bamboo stick.  

And it stung, it stung pretty badl y. 
 

 

So you experience d this?
 

 

I experienced tha t, yeah.  And whe n
 
he really got m ad, then you had 
to bend over and  get a few lashes on your behind .  And that was 

perfectly accepte d practice, there was no complaints from parents 

about it in  those  days.  I suppose  most of  them di d think they  were 

doing the right t hing but
 
it didn' t feel like it.
 
 

Was there a sens e though, tha t t hey knew you  had  to be  in this  

school?
 

 

Well, some.  But again, it was part of the whole picture of 

gradually being d eprived of privil eges and freedom.   In the firs t  

two or three years, my memory of
 
it isn't clear enough to really be 
able to answer  th at kind of que sti on, but certainly , one might say 

in some ways thin gs were getting w orse and worse.  There was
--being 

in an all  Jewish environment proba bly had its  good side too in  terms  

of being in a community with oth er people going through the same 

 
 
 
 
9
 
thing.  And so there was some se nse, I think, of  mutual support  
from that as well.  But interestingly enough, this has always  

astounded me that  through all t he times during the  war, even after  

there had been
 
t ransports and a fair people were  deported, that 
those who still  r emained, as much  as they both w orr ied about their 

friends and rela tives who had be en taken and as  much as we all 

worried what would happen to allof us eventually, that we all
--I 

think there was  a tendency to try and maintain  a semblance of  

normality as  muc h as possibl e.  And so that  whet her it invol ved 

people getting t ogether socially,  you know, havin g card parties,  

kids worrying  in school about  whet her they g ot thei r homework  right,  

whethe
r the teac her is going to get mad at them or not, whether 

their parents ar e going to get u pset with thei r grades; to som e 

extent that stil l remained part  of life.  And probably it was  

helpful part of  l ife in creating  s ome balance for  the all the  other 

worr
isome things.   So I remember particularly as I myself, I was  

sort of an avera ge indifferent s tudent, the firs t three or four,  

the first three grades.  And then suddenly, I  became a very 

outstanding stude nt in the fourth grade and got  a l ot of praise  for  

it
.  I remember t hat that meant  a lot to me.  And a s
--
you know, a t  

the same tim e va guely remembering  also worryi ng a bout other k ids  

being jealous of  me and trying to  put me down by  mo cking me and so 

these were all pa rt of li fe, even  d uring those very difficult times.
 
 

Would you like to  discuss the cour se of events then , of how...?
 
 

Yeah, right, I' ll  be glad to.  Well, I suppose  I al ready mentioned  

these laws that were being gradually passed.In t he beginning of 

1942, the first  t ransports began.  Initially, the p eople who were  

subject to bein g transported w ere young peopl e, really late 

adolescents and  k ids in their  earl y twenties, bo th male and femal e, 

unattached, singl e and so on.  The se were the first  population that 

was subject to d eportation.  So that didn't pers onally affect us  

although one of my cousins was in that category.  And she 

fortunately, wel l not so  fortuna tely because eve ntually she  was  

killed, but at least during that period of time, she hid out and so 

was not caught in that group.  But as I understand, maybe my 

historical knowle dge isn't totall y accurate, but this group that  

they got from Sl ovakia were real ly used, these y oung people, to 

build some of the  camps.  I think some of them really were involved 

in building Ausc hwitz during tha t time. 
 
So a few of that group  
actually survived  on to the  end of  the war, having become kapos and  

so on but mos t of  them were ki lled .  In fact, about  95, 98% of  the 

 
 
 
 
10
 
kids that were c aught at that ti me were.  Now the next law that 
came out did affect us.  Thenext
 
group that was subject to 
deportation were  men, single  or ma rried, within  a c ertain age  range.   

My father was  in that age range.  This was all on t he up and up at 

that time, so to  speak, so the a nnouncements were  made publicly,  

that at such and  such a time, th ese people would  be expected to 

report for reloca tion or deportati on to labor camps  in the eastern  

territories.  Thi s was all d one by  the Slovakian au thorities.  T his 

was not done by G ermans.
 

 

Was there any typ e of a Jewish cou ncil in this comm unity?
 

 

Yes, there was a Jewish council. Throughout this period of time, 

there was a Jewish council, I think both locally and statewide in 

Slovakia, that t ried to interven e on behalf of the community.  

There'll be a  cou ple of instances  where I'll mentio n they act
ually  

were effective i n securing something but I don't  know whether at  

that point they were particular effective.  I'm not sure, I just  

don't know en ough  about that.  So  then
--
I mean
--
aga in an excelle nt 

example of the k ind of
--
how chan ce played a trem endous role in 

survival.  The w ay my father  was  going to avoid this particular  

deportation was that he and a Jewish journeyman of his were going 

to hide out in his shop.  And presumably, since this shop was 

legally a Chri sti an establishment,  they would not c ome
 
and look for  
him there.  This shop actually happened to be pract ically adjoining  

the apartment whe re we lived, t her e was just a  wall  that separated  

our apartment  fro m the sho p.  A nd this I ha ve a,  yo u know, a memory,  

not a very  vivid  one, but  a memo ry for
 
that  my f ather and thi s  
journeyman of his  were going to  sp end the evening  i n our apartment  

playing cards with the plan that later on
--
for some reason or  

another--
they did n't expect, you  k now the raid  to b egin until late  

at night; that  l ater on they  wou ld move to the s hop and hide  out 

there.  But my m other had a head ache and after t hey played there  

for about half an hour, she said, I want to go to bed, why don't 

you go to the sho p now?  And  so they did,  Wi thin a bout 15 minutes,  

the police, the  g endarmes were at  the door, looking  for my father. 

They looked all a round the  apartme nt, under  the bed s, in th e closets  

and anywhere; an d of course, the y didn't find an y because he was 

already in the s hop.  But had my mother not had a headache, you 

know, he would  h ave been taken a nd if he ha d bee n taken, I doubt 

very much  if any  of the re st of  us  would ha ve survi ved.  So there  

was a whole serie s of things like that.
 

 

 
 
 
 
11
 
They didn't assau lt the rest of th e family because. ..?
 
 

No, because
--
they  didn't assault.   They grill ed m y mother,  where  

is he. My mother  said, I don't know, he just went off somewhere.  

I think it's a l ittle humid he re,  I'm going  to pu t down....  The  

next thing and th is was, I guess  a round April, May,  I guess April,  

early May of 1942  came the n ew law,  that all f amilies unless exempted  

would be subje ct to deportation.  The law was very specific about
-

- 
and was presented as if for ourown good
--
to teach us the virtues 
of labor.  The l aw was very spec ific about lugga ge, how much per  

person and so on and so forth.An d this was to be
--
everybody was  

to report some t ime in advance, I think two week s from the time 

that the law was  announced.  And so that was the  big thing
--how  

were people goin g to react  to t h is.  Most of  the m, I would  say 

really saw no opt ion but to comply .  You know, y ou have to remember 

that this was  at  a time in  the war when an allie d victory seemed  

very far away.  S o that there seem ed little prosp ec t, you know,  of 

finding any  hidin g place that woul d last fo r years.   So  most peop le  

resign
ed themsel ves to just comp lying with the l aw, including a 

number of my imm ediate relatives in the same tow n including the 

aunt and uncle th at I mentioned be fore.  They  had  a  little d aughter  

at that point who  was about three years old.
 
 

May I ask you, w hat
--
did you hav e any knowledge of the camps and  
..?
 

 

At that point, we  didn't have any knowledge at all.  And I suppos ed 

people's reactio ns to this cha llenged varied to some extent 

according to t hei r ideas and  attit udes about peo ple , life and  their 

own character re ally.  So that, for example, in  the case of my 

parents, my  mothe r in parti cular, she tended  to be  m istrustful which  

turned out to be a very good thing
--
a very good way to be.  So that  

although she had no idea, certainly at that point, about any kind 

of systematic ext ermination but  sh e was very clear that these cam ps 

would, at the  ver y least, pose a t remendous danger to my sister  and 

me that at the  ve ry least, we wou l d be subject to  d ying of disease 

or of starvation.   And she was det ermined therefore , that no matter 

what, no matter how she wasn't g oing to go along  with this law. 

That had something to do with her character, with her ideas about 

things.  Whereas her sister re acte d differently,  wh at else can  one 

do except to go a long with it .  At  that point,  you  know, there were 

a fair number  of people who  did have exemp t ions, official 

exemptions, who w ere not subject t o the deportation  at that time.  

 
 
 
 
12
 
The whole histor y of this thing
--
you know
--
you h ave to remember 
again that this  a rea was not un der  direct German  co ntrol.  In the 
areas that were u nder direct Germa n control, there were never an y  

exemptions with regard to Jews b ut in this case there were.  And  

there continued to be over time.  Not necessarily, you know, I 

don't know what  d ictated
--
certainl y the
 
more  influential you were,  
the wealthier yo u were, the more likely you were to have an 

exemption.  I'm s ure bribing p laye d a role  in that  and so on.  Now 

during this time , my parents did  not have any way to secure an 

exemption.  There were differe nt o rders of exemptio ns. There was  a  

yellow exemption  because it was on yellow paper which is kind of 

the plebeian ex em ption; that was n' t so great.  And it went all  the 

way to the  presi dential exemption  which only  a r e latively people  

had and they were  most secure duri ng that time.  So the only option 

that my parents had at that time was to try to cross into Hungary 

illegal.  This became one avenue  that other peop le also tried to  

take advantage of.  Very soon ther e was a traffic in illegal parties 

crossing the boar der into Hung ary.   Because during that time, ev en 

though the Hungarians when they had come in, kicked us out 

officially, Jews  were not being
--
Hungarian Jews  were not being 

deported in 1942.  They werenot really even that directly 

threatened durin g that time.  So my parents arranged to join a 

group that had  its guide, it s leader.  It  was a business 

proposition.  Thi s person, you kno w, got paid so  mu ch per person in  

the party.  Like our group I thi nk consisted of about 13 people,  

two or th ree diff erent families.   The actual  way we  went across wa s  

during the night,  through open fie lds and s wamps an d so on.   Duri ng  

the day, after t h e first night, w e  hid out and  rest ed and then the 

second night we completed our jo urney across the  boarder to the 

outskirts of the  nearest Hungarian city or town which was Omvar 

(ph)(c.522), now  it's part of U k raine, it's call ed Oshgovar (ph) 

(c.524).  But at any rate, and  by prearrangement we  were
---
when w e  

got to the  outsk irts of this  tow n around 3  or 4  o'clock in  the  

morning after a really long
--
I certainly remember very vividly that  

crossing into  Hun gary and going in  the dark  through  the fields.  At  

one point, we ran into a band of Gypsies and we heard them saying 

there go the Jew s running.  And then there was a panic that the 

Gyps
ies would go  into the next town and tell on the group.  But 

apparently that didn't happen.  I remember, I ma y remember, for  

example, you wal ked on these fie lds which seemed  like only long 

grass and suddenly you were knee
-
deep in water because it was  
appare
ntly swampy  ground underneat h and it was  gett ing cold and it  

seemed to go  on f orever.  We final ly got to th is pl ace which was  a 

 
 
 
 
13
 
sort of farm h ouse at the edge of town wit h a barn.  By  
prearrangement wi th the owner of  this farmhouse an d barn, we were  

put up
 
for the  re st of the night  i n the barn.  We sort of
--
on the 
straw in the barn and we fell asleep because we were all very tired 

at that point.  The next thing we know is, we hear Hungarian 

policemen saying good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Will you pleas
e 

accompany me to  t he police statio n ?  And so he, in fact, herded us  

through the streets of Omguar (ph)(c.556).  The men were all 

handcuffed and to ok us into  prison .  For the next w eek we remained  

there in jail in  Omguar.  I person ally was in a  jai l cell wi th my  

father and ano the r man.  My sister was with  my mo ther and one  or  

two other woman. Now during that week, apparently
- --
 

   
(Start of Side B)
 
week rather than  returning us im mediately to Slo vakia.  Was
--we 

learned later on that they were actually thinking seriously of 

shooting the who le party as an e xample to others  because so many 

people were maki ng this illegal crossing during that time.  And 

again another ex ample of how cha nce worked in ou r favor, really,  

not immediately  a pparent but wh at happened was t hat  during the  time 

we were there, my  father got the idea that since Refini (ph)(c.550) 

where he had bee n born had also become part of H ungary by then, 

that he decided  t o come forward to  the police cap ta in and show him 

his birth certif icate and claim the fact that he 's Hungarian and  

should be allowe d to remain in H ungary.  Well the police captain  

took his birth ce rtificate, tore i t into pieces, slapped him on the 

face and pushed him back into the jail cell.Wh ere were we?So  

that--
I'll pick u p that thread of the story a little later on.  S o
-

-
and the other thing that we learned and I don't know how true this 
is, that obviousl y somebody had  tu rned us in b ecaus e the policeman  

knew exactly w her e to come.  And  the best guess  w as that we  were 

actually turned
 
i n by the owner  of  the farmhouse an d barn and that  
his motivation pr obably was that he expected that  everybody would 

have valuables w ith them.  He d idn't undertake that kind of a  

yearning to a new  life without try ing to convert al l that you ha d  

into negotiable valuables, like gold, diamonds, dollars and stuff  

like that.  And that the minute  t he policeman show ed up, it woul d 

all be stashed in  the hay; which  i s exactly what,  s ay for example, 

my father did,  wh o did have  severa l pounds of  gold and diamonds and
 
so on being a jeweler.  And this m an had the gall to come and visit 

us in jail and when my father said, you know, can you find that  

stuff and put it away somewhere fo r us, for safe kee ping?, he said,  

he looked, he didn't see anything. Yet, later on,  he was seen by 

others to  be sell ing off t he stuff to a  jewelry  sto re.  So at any  

 
 
 
 
14
 
rate, they finally did decide to send us back to Brehaalza 
(ph)(c.9).
 
 

Do you remember w hat it was like t o be in this jail ?
 

 

Yeah, I remember  it.  It was
--
it was very scary and strange and  

then...But one  thing I think that's important to remember, that 

the fact that
--
an d that's true  for  the entire story
--
the fact that  
I was always wit h my parents.  It gave me  a feel ing of securit y,  

having some kind  of blind faith  th at somehow, they' ll find a way to 

protect me or sav e me.  Probably kept me from b ein g as frightened 

all along as bein g in these  kind o f situations,  one  might have  been.   

With a couple of exceptions where I suddenly would sense that maybe 

they don't know what the hell to do with it, what's going to happen 

with us.  So  any way, interestingl y, we were  given  a choice,  the  

party was given  a choice, whether  to go back  on f oot or be t aken 

back by bus.  I remember as a k id, I wanted the  bus ride.  You 

know, as a littl e  kid in those  day s, one didn't ge t  to travel much 

and I had all th ese adventurous ideas about trav el.  I felt very  

disappointed that  the adults witho ut exception, yo u  know, chose  to 

walk back rather than to take the  bus.  Because  the ir thinking  was,  

the longer we ta k e
 
to get back to the hell that is  waiting for us, 
the better off we are.So we we re in a kind of walk back to the 

border, handed ov er to the Slovaki an police who the n shepherded us  

back finally  to o ur
--
the town  wher e we star ted out  from.  And  there  

we were immedia te ly, of course,  pu t in jail again.  And this time, 

I was put  in a l arger cell b ut th is time with  abou t a dozen  women  

and their childr e n.  All lying on a plank alongsid e  one end o f the 

cell so that we w ere practically p iled up on top of  each other
. 

 

Were these Jewish  women?
 

 

These were all J ewish women and children.  Those who perhaps had  

also been caught  but most of th em just part of  the continuing  

processing of the  Jews who were  go ing to be depor te d to the camps.  

The other thing  I  remember, is tha t the only toil et  facility was a 

room next to the  cell, that you ha d to ask the g uar d to let you go 

to.  Essentially, you urinated on the floorwhich is where 

everything was  al l piled up.  Now, a couple  of da ys, and I  guess  

the way these thi ngs went, and
 
I'm  not sure who wa s jailed befor e  
being taken.  I think some people  were directly  ta ken and I thin k 

that most people  who were in the  jail were peopl e who either had  

been hiding and  w ere caught and pu t in jail befor e they were going 

 
 
 
 
15
 
to be transporte d.  Because I remember, we were there for a few  
days and the first day, we were visited by my aunt and her three
-

year old daughter .  They were abo ut to go direc tly , I guess, int o 

the transport. M aybe that day, or  the next day. Then I remember 

very well and I remember how, I g uess to reassure their child wh o  

was a very cute little girl, they told her that they were all going 

to Palestine.  S he was, you know , talking very e nthusiastically 

about how they  we re going to go to  Palestine.  Anyw ay, after a  few 

days in t hat jail , our tur n came  t o be take n to  the  trains.  Once  

again, you know,  we were part of  a
--
essentially a herd of people 

that were shephe rded by the gend armes or the loc al Slovakian SS 

guard.  We were t aken and this wasone of the times where I....Yeah,  

one thing again,  from a child's point of view.  As that morning  

came when this whole party in that cell were all to go on to the 

trains, my mother  went into  hyster ics and ke pt yell ing and sc reaming  

about how she, yo u know, can't  stand the idea  of ha ving her chil dren  

starved or so  on.   She doesn't wan t to go.  I remem ber as a  child,  

feeling mostly very self
-
conscious and embarrassed that my mother 
was making such  a big scen e during that.  I was wishing  

like______(c.631)  she'd be quiet.   And the other  wo men saying, it's 

all right, it' ll  be all  right.  The first plac e they took us  was 

actually to a sch ool and it was a very busy place as new parties of 

Jews were being b rought in.  T his was the final act before going on 

to the railroad s tation to get on the trains.  You got your number.  

From that point  on, you were  no longer a person  with a name,  you 

were a person with a number and a tag that you had around your neck.  

Just before our t urn came to get our numbers, an o fficial came i n  

and said anybody  who can prove tha t they are of  for eign extraction 

or foreign citiz ens, please come  and see me.  At  that point, you  

know, of course, the issue came up again that my father was born in 

Ruthenia which wa s at that poin t,  part of Hunga ry.   Of course, he 

had had such a bad experience the last time he tried to take 

advantage of that  fact, that he w as somewhat hesitant to approach  

this official abo ut it.  But, y ou know, my mother said, what do you 

have to lose  now?   Here's again wh ere chance c omes into play.  The  

reason he had
 
t he --
you know the or iginal was torn  u p by the police 
captain in Hungar y
--
the reason he  had a duplicate  w as because they  

had actually trie d to get out  of  Czechoslovakia a s early as 193 6  

when the times  st arted to get bad.   It was very har d to get out of 

Cz
echoslovakia, much harder than  it was to get out of Germany, 

particularly to the United State s which is where  he wanted to go 

because his bro th er was here.  But  even though  he g ot an affidavit  

in 1936, the quota was so discriminatory against Slavic countri
es  

 
 
 
 
16
 
because of the  gr eat immigration f rom the Slavic  ar eas, so that it 
was virtually impossible to come to America for someone from 

Czechoslovakia, whereas, there was no di scrimi natory against  

Germans.   That's why so many Germans who elected to come to 

Ame
rica, German  J ews actually did come as late  as  '38 or '39.  So 

at any rate, but in order to go th rough the process, he had to get
-

-
to have two copi es of his birth c ertificate.  So h e made the  trip 
to his hometown, sometime in 1937 or '38 and he did have two copies 

of his birth cert ificate at  his di sposal.  If  he  ha dn't, I w ouldn't  

be here.  So anyway, he showed this man his cop y of the birth 

certificate and the man said, al l right, why don 't ;you and your 

family wait al ong  with maybe  one or two other  peo ple.  And so we  

were waiting the re for, I  think,  an hour  or two  hours.  In  the  

meantime, people were being just shepherded through .  We looke d out  

the window and t h ere was a whole  c onvoy of people b eing led in the 

direction of the railroad station.  And then
 
acouple of hours  
later, he comes back and he says, all those people that I had asked 

to stay aside  and  wait, please  com e and follow  me.  He went to the  

front door and h e said, you are free to go home.  Now and here  

again, you know, the combination o f chance and circ umstance, because  

apparently that was the first da y when people wh o had
--
were not 

citizens of fore ign countries we re exempt.  Prior to that time,  

only people who were citizens with a valid passp ort from another  

country were exe mpt from deportation.  So that p robably the fact  

that we did tryto go to Hungary, that we did go there, the fact 

even that they kept us for a week in the jail there rather than  

returning us imm e diately, and del a yed the whole  pro cess, saved our 

lives during that
--
even perhaps if it was true that they were  

thinking of shoot ing us in Hungary
--
that helped to save us durin g  
that moment.So then we went back to our apartment which had all  

been officially  s ealed and my  fath er had to  go to  th e police stat ion 

to have an official come and unseal the apartment and so on.An d  

so we got back  an d for the next  fe w weeks, I start e d going back to 

school.  Of cours e, I was
---
many  f ewer kids were  in  that school  at 

that point and I  had only been th e re a few weeks  be fore because in 

this first
 
wave  of deportation,  a great many o f the Jews were  
deported during  that time.  Probably a very small percentage 

survived because  most of them  were  taken to  the ext ermination camps  

directly--
Sobibor , Treblinka,  I t hink, and Majdan ek.  We did  get  

postcards 
and,  a s I say,  most of  my relatives  we re taken durin g 
those transports.   In fact,  betwe en relatives,  bo th in Slo vakia,  

an uncle in Germany, an uncle in Poland and their respective 

families; of abo u t 25 relatives,  u ncles, aunts, co u sins; there was 

 
 
 
 
17
 
only one person t hat survived besi des our immediate  family.  So for 
a few wee ks, you  know, as far as  w e knew, t hings we re okay.  Then  

one Saturday mor ning, there's a knock on our doo r and the police 

are there.  T hey name each of our names, I don't know, remember th
e 

Garden of the Fin zi
-
Continis remem ber at the end  w here the police  
comes in and c all s out everybody's  name? that's exa ctly the way it 

was.  The police  called each  of ou r names including  my sister's and  

mine and said p lease pack up a nd get ready to  come to
 
go to 
_____(c.140). T hen what followed was almost acomedy routine. 

These were Slova kian fascists gu ardists, not ver y sophisticated.  

My mother said sh e can't go,  she's  sick, she  can't get out bed.   My  

father says to them, look I'm a manager of the shop, of this 

Christian shop ri ght next door.  I f you take me, are you willing to 

be responsible for all the contents in that shop? Besides which,  

says my father, this is all a mi stake and I can go to one of the  

officials and have it fixed up right away.  So these policemen 

decided the f ollo wing:  They had o ther business to transact, other  

Jews to pick up.  If my father gav e them his word o f honor that he  

wouldn't try to escape, they wou ld let him go an d see whether he  

could get some of ficial interventi on on his behalf.   But they would 

keep coming back  during the day to make sure tha t my mother, my 

sister and I wer e not trying  to escape.  So the minute they wa lk  

out, my mother  tu rns to my fat her and says, we got to run.  And my 

father say with a bit of fame, b ut I gave my wor d of honor.  How  

can I escape?  So he went off to  see what he cou ld do, you know,  

whether he could get some interven tion from the off icials that h e  

knew.  But my mot her regardless of  what he had said, kept trying to 

see if we could e scape.  But  every time, she was st ill in bed.  She  

was officially  si ck, you see.  To o sick to  move.  Every time she 

tried to get dre ssed so that he and the two of u s, the two of us  

children could t ake off together , the police wou ld be back.  She 

immediately had  t o
 
take all  of her  clothes off a nd put her nightg own 
back on and get  under the cover s so that was a kind of comedy 

routine aspect of  this day.  In th e meantime, my  fa ther found that  

he couldn't get a ny help from any  officials but he  talked to som e  

other people, som e other Jewish pe ople in the street, told them his 

situation. They all told him he was crazy to worry about word of  

honor and by then  he got word back  to us that we s hould run if w e  

can and that he was going to  meet us at som e des ignated place at  

t
he end of the  da y.  Eventuall y, w hat happened  was my mother  simply  
put a raincoat o n and ran across  the street to J ewish people who  

were at that poi nt exempt, where she stayed for the rest of the 

day.  Again my  f ather's journeyma n took my  sister  and me  acr
oss  

 
 
 
 
18
 
town to the place where everybody was supposed to converge at the 
end of the day which was the  ho me of the p arent s of one of  my 

father's apprenti ces.  
 
 

These are _______ __?(c.184)
 
 

The journeyman  wa s Jewish b ut the  a pprentice was  a C hristian friend,  

a 
gentile  friend.   So  there was  so me further advent ures but I won't  
go into details  b ut we all finally  did get t ogether that evening  in 

that place,  in th at home.  As a  Je wish kid and the  first time  really  

I was in a Christian home; there are crosses all over the walls and 

I didn't know  qui te what to ma ke o f that.  But we w ere there for  a 

day, two days  an d pretty soon  th ese people, wh os e house it  was, 

were getting a li ttle nervous and uneasy.  Clea rly,  that wasn't the 

place where we c ould
--
there was no hiding
 
place really.  There 
wasn't a place where you could stay for very long.  Then what  

happened was my  parents got wo rd through the apprentice whose  

parents' house we  were at, that  th e chief of polic e  had come to  my 

father's shop an d told my father 's partner that he would like to 

speak to Gruber and him.  And that if my father 's partner knew 

where Gruber was , to let him know that he wants  to talk to my 

father.  So my p arents got t hat message and they  had to  make a  

decision, whether  to accept  this in vitation or
 
ign or e it.  I imagine  
they had a pre tty  hard time mak ing  a decision bu t t he alternative
-

- 
I mean  there wa s an implied  promise that the re ma y be a  deal in  
the making.  The alternative, na mely of trying t o stay there was 

really impossibl e for any lengt h of time.  So then my parents  

decided that yes,  my father would  go with his par tner and see th e  

chief of police.  I do remember t h at day when my fa ther left early  

in the morning an d it was hours an d hours and we he ard nothing about  

him or fro m him .  Obvious ly,
 
w e were sca red s tiff about  what  
happened to him.   Finally he showed up.  What had happened was  

this, that he got there with his partner.He wa s made to wait a 

couple of hours.  Finally the chie f of police saw b oth of them  and  

he asked my  fathe r's partner, do  y ou need this  Jew, Gruber for  your 

shop?  My father's partner said yes, you know, i t's important to  

have somebody who  can manage these  things and so o n and so forth.  

And then the poli ce says, but  of c ourse you can 't h ave any objec tion  

if I can f ind a
 
Gentile who  can  do the sa me jo b.  My father's  
partner said, I  g uess not.  And so , okay, let me ca ll the Ministry  

of Labor in Brat islava to see  if  I can find  you a Gentile person  

who can take over  the management.  So while my father was there, he  

called up
 
the Min istry of Labor, a sked them questio ns, took a while 

 
 
 
 
19
 
for the answer to  come back.  Fina lly the answer was no, that there 
was no qualified Gentile jeweler who could come and take over the 

shop.  So he gave my father a temporary exempt ion and on the 

st
rength of this ,  we all cam e out  of our hid ing a nd went back  to 

our apartment.  But apparently t hat wasn't the f inal chapter on  

this.  A few week s later there  was
--
apparently the  town council o r 
whatever it was t hat had both the  town functionaries decided c
ase 

by case, made fi nal decisions ab out whether this  or that person 

would be exempt.  Apparently what we heard later  on  was that when  

our case came up,  actually mo st of  them wanted  to send us off.   But  

it was the presid ent of the chambe r of commerce tha t said if the y  

send my father of f, he would res ig n as president of  the chamber of 

commerce.  No w th e reason for that  was this:  as you may or may not  

know, at the tim e of the Czechoslovakia republic,  really most of  

the industry was  in the Czech  part , not the Slovaki an part, so  that 

Slovakia was very underdeveloped in terms of industry and even 

trades, very skilled trades.  So that there were not very many 

master jewelers.  I talked to him  about it
--
this  g oes all the wa y 

back to the guild system.To become a jeweler, you had to be an 

apprentice for a few years and the n a journeyman fo r another couple 

of years until  yo u became a mas ter  jeweler.  My fa ther's shop had 

four Gentile app rentices so that  these were four  future Gentile 

Slovak master  jew elers who this pr esident of  the ch amber of c ommerce  

felt were sorely  needed because there were so fe w.  His idea was  

that if my fathe r was sent, the shop would colla pse.  Because he  

knew that really my father, even t hough officially it belonged t o  

his partner, tha t it was
 
he who  was making it r un.  And so his  
opinion prevailed  and we did get  a more firm kin d of exemption .  

Now one never  kne w during that tim e how long  an exemption like this  

would last.Just  as, you know, after the first time when we were  

let go, just six weeks later, they were ready to send us off again.  

There were dif fe rent groups of  p eople who had  be en exempt for  a 

period of time a nd suddenly the rules changed.  For example, for  

some period of t ime, American ci tizens were exem pt.  There were 

some American  ci tizens, people  w ho had emigr ated  before the  war, 

who then returne d home after securing an Americ an citizenship. 

Suddenly, the gr apevine had it t hat, and they we re correct, that  

the Americans
--
t hat exemption wa s going to drop.   Word got out 

enough in adva nc e that most  of t he people invo lv ed were able  to 

hide.  So the nex t day came this is all a mistake, American citizens  

are still exemp t and will contin ue  to forever be ex empt.  A couple 

of days later,  wh en everybody had  come out of  the hiding, they were
 
able to get most of them and deport them.So vario us groups, you  

 
 
 
 
20
 
never knew w hat w as going to  happe n next.  At some  point, a new  law  
came into effe ct  that families  i n which at least  one member  had 

converted to Chri stianity prior to  1938, would be exempt.
  
The ide a 

of making it prior to 1938 was with the idea
--
they didn't want 

opportunistic--
it  had to be sincere.Of course , who converted 

prior to 1 938?  Very few, if any  people.  B ut ne cessity is  the  

mother of inve nti on and pretty  a w hole trade dev elo ped around fal se 

conversion papers .Now these wer e real in the sense that priests 

were involved in giving them, a ctu ally selling t hem  to Jews.  They 

would make these  out, you know, wh ere one person in  the family had 

supposedly conver ted prior to 1938 .  As witnesses,  they would put 

down the names of people who had died in the meantime so they could 

never be challenged.As I say, a whole trade developed and
---but  

the funny thing
--
this is in term s of the kind of  co mmunity it was.  
A lot of familie s still had a lot of trouble ab out making that 

decision even t ho ugh it was, you k now, a fake conve rsion.  But the 

tradition that o ne thing you do not do, is deny the name of the 

Lord, was so stro ng in many of the se families that a lot of families  

had trouble wit h it.  Strangely en ough, a child wou ld be picked  to 

be the one who h ad converted bec ause the parents  would refuse to 

have that blemish  on their reco rd.   In our case, m y father didn't  

have any problem  about that .  He volunteered  to be the one.  But 

somehow, I rem em ber even those  i t was only my fa ther, my famil y 

still felt that we all should act like we meant it.  So for a while  

my sister and I were taught the catechism by som ebody.  But then  

after a certain period of time, the transports stopped.Again, I  

don't know how  m uch you know  of that history but  this was o ne of  

the few instances  where, in fact,  t he papacy  did int ervene on  behalf  

of the Jews.  Wha t happened wa s
--
t his was after the  two
---actually  

Slovakian Jews e s caped from Ausch w itz.  I forget th eir names.  The
y 

brought back ver y  detailed inform a tion about just  e xactly what was 

going on in Ausc hwitz.  They came back to Czecho slovakia, were 

smuggled by the  Jewish official s to Switzerland  and gave that  

information to  th e United Stat es o fficials actually   at that p
oint  

but also to the people delegated.   By that point, everything was  

known, because of that particular report.  As a result of that  

knowledge, the P apal Nuncio (c.8 87) did put a lo t of pressure on 

the Slovakian go vernment to stop the transport.  This was 
within  

the power of the  S lovakian governme nt just as  it  had been a Slo vakian  

government initiative to get the transports going in the first 

place.  This was a very Catholic  area.  In fact, the Slovakian  

fuhrer was a prie st, Monsignor Tea sall (ph)(cc.325 was the Slovakian  

fuhrer.  Because of that press ure,  the transports w ere stopped f or 

 
 
 
 
21
 
some period of  ti me.  But of cours e one never knew when they would  
resume.  You asked before, did people know and when did people 

know?  We did get  postcards from that first
 
wave ofpeople including 
our relatives  eit her from Majd anek  or Sobibor,  I fo rget.  Messages 

like, everything is wonderful and  so on.  They wer e made to writ e 

these postcards  just after arriv al.  The usu al c ommunication did  

get transmitted to the community
 
there.  Namely,  a coded message 
to at least let p eople know things  are really bad.  Might have been  

something like Uncle Al went to visit Aunt Ethel yesterday and we 

expect to visit her very soon ou rselves and she is dead.  That 

knowledge puts
--
t he details I thin k in terms of gas chambers and so 

on, were not k now n but...  The ne xt chapter was  th is; even though 

at that point things were relatively calm because there was a  

cessation of t he transports.  Here again, for some period of time ,  

those people who were left tried a s much as possibl e to restore a  

normal type of  li fe, as much norma l as possible.  T he big question  

mark was, things are just bound to get worse, particularly as the 

war winds down, comes to its final stage and how will one get  

through that. 
 
F or a while, a ne w idea sort  of b ecame popular in  
the remaining Je wish community there.  Namely, that at the very  

least, what you  need to do is to  get your c hildr en to a boa rding 

school in Hung ary , to Jewish  board ing schools in  Hu ngary.  So that 

if things
 
start  b eing bad here, it  will be much  eas ier for parents 
that are not enc umbered by their  children to mak e a quick escape 

themselves out  of  Slovakia and  joi n their childr en in Hungary.  By 

that time, you kn ow, it was poss ib le for money to  o btain very good
 

papers that gave  you an legal H ung arian passport so  that one coul d 

make that trip le gally.  At some p oint, my parents got caught up in 

the same idea an d  so at one po int,  my mother took  m y sister and me 

to a town, a city in Hungary, Mishgov (ph)(c.939) where there was 

a Jewish boardin g school in whic h there already were a number of 

the kids f rom M ichalovce that  h ad been pl aced there.  Wh at I  

remember is agai n, I found the w hole idea very e xciting.  I had 

read in books abo ut boys in boardi ng schools and so  on and so forth.   

So when we got there, my mother did put me in thisboarding school. 
 
 

What month and ye ar is this, do yo u know?
 

 

This is about Fe bruary of 1944.  So she put me in this boarding 

school and what  I remember tha t immediately I  felt tremendous  

homesick then.   I  was very unhappy  and very sad  abo ut looking  ahead  

to having to stay  there.  Because of all this, I do remember trying 

to put a lot of pressure on my mother to change her mind.  Precocio us 

 
 
 
 
22
 
maturity, I talke d to her about  ho w we're going t o
 
be separated by  
a border and this is war time and one never knows what's going to 

happen and so on.   So she ended u p really feeling  very conflicted 

about the decisio n that she had m ade; to place me  in that school.  

She decided to d elay really the whole thing with  my sister.  My 

sister needed a t onsillectomy so w hat she decided t o do was to g o  

to Budapest and h ave my sister hav e her tonsillecto my there.  Whil e 

my sister was  rec uperating in B uda pest, she was  sti ll very troubl ed 

about her decisio n although one  of  her principal  wo rries whether I  

might be subjec t to bombing a ttacks because there were some  

important industr ies in M_ ______(c .969).  Some peop le were t alking  

about possible  bo mbing there.  But  she also
--
she wa s staying whe re 

there was a Jewish concierge and she got to talking to him and he 

gave her another  source of anxiety  because he sa id,  you think it's 

going to be  all t hat safe her e?  M y mother ask ed, what do you  mean?  

He said, I've  se en a lot  of German officers la tel y come here.  I  

don't know what's  happening, wh at' s going to  happen .  So there was 

another source o f concern for her.  She got so worried about it  

that she wrote my  father in  some c oded way that  she 's thinking a bout  

changing the  pla n.  My father  s ent her a  teleg ram saying  act 

according
 
to our original decision .She was unwil ling to take it 
upon herself to  c hange that.  But  she was looki ng  for someone w ho 

she knew was in  B udapest from our  hometown, who was  planning to go  

back very soon  to  Michalovce and  w anted personally to let him know
 

about all her co ncerns so that h e could talk to my father.  She 

looked all over  B udapest for him,  couldn't find him .  On the last 

afternoon of this  man's stay in  Bu dapest, she happe ned to run int o  

him at a  restaur ant.  Again, you  know, pure  chan ce.  So sh
e told  

him all about it  and how she wou ld be terribly wo rried, etc. etc .  

and he got b ack, talked to my  fath er.  My father, a t that point,  I 

guess got so wo rr ied that if som et hing did happen  h e would have to 

bear the brunt  of  that, so he  wire d my mother t o br ing me home.  I 

remember that  day  very well.   It w as one of  the ha ppiest days o f my 

life up to that  p oint.  When  I had  sort of begun  to resign to myself  

to staying whe re  I really still didn't very mu ch  didn't want  to 

stay.  That  the d irector of t he sc hool came to  me one day and  said, 

you're going to  B udapest and join  your mother and  a rranged to have 

someone accompany  me and t ake me t o Budapest.  I jo ined my mother,  

came home.  Whe n  he brought  us h ome, people in M ichalovce said,  

told my mother, it was crazy, sh e was a totally,  pathologically 

over
-
protective m other and how  cou ld she have  done t his.  I remember  
running in to the  father of  one of  the boys  who w as  there in  that 

school, who when  I was ther e told me how =m e how  very unhappy  he  

 
 
 
 
23
 
was there, how  ve ry
 
much he wanted  to go.  I talked  to his fath er, 
asked me about his son, I told him that he really was very unhappy, 
very much wanted  to come back an d his father said,  he doesn't know 

what's best  for h im.  Well,  as eve ryone knows,  real ly within two or  

three
 
weeks, the big turnaround in  Hungary took pla ce.  The Germans 
did come in much  more directly controlling the s ituation and the  

deportation of th e Jews from Hunga ry began.Are yo u out of tape?
 
 

Actually we're ru nning out, yeah. We'll change it now.
 

 

Five were accused from Budapest.In the provinces, you know, the 

deportation of Je ws was much, much
--
was really very , very extensive.   
Most of the peop le in the provin ces didn't survi ve.  This was in  

the provinces.  M ishalovce.  So ve ry quickly  the sc hool
 
was s eized 
by the local fas cists and the Ge rmans and most o f the kids from 

that school were  sent directly to Auschwitz and killed, including  

that boy whose fa ther, you know, I  talked to.  A nd, of course, when 

that happened,  s uddenly my mothe r had, yo u know,  become
--turned  

from a crazy wom a n into a great  sa ge who had the  fo resight to make 

the right decisi o n.  Then  what
--
so  that phase  finis hed.  Then  later 

on I guess in th e beginning sprin g or maybe mid
-
sp ring of 1944, I  
remember I was at a soccer game
--watc
hing a soccer game with a 

couple of friends  of mine
--
when  th e sister of on e o f these friends  

came and told  us that we better  go  home.  That they 're going to  be 

taking the Jews a gain.  I got home  and my parents had already heard 

about that too.  This was not an  official announ cement.  By this  

time, the grapevi ne was pretty goo d so that a stor y like that go t  

out before they intended it to get out.And so th en the question  

became is what ar e we going  to d o  and where  are we  going to hide? 

My parents, I do  remember that fa irly clearly, talking and tryin g  

to think of all  the possible alte rnatives and deciding finally to  

approach the pres ident of the c ham ber of commerce.  who had been s o 

much ____in my fa ther's behalf ear lier.  And so the y approached him 

about whether we could hide out on his property.  He said okay.  In 

fact, he had one or two other  fami lies that he  had already arranged  

to hide.  Now where did he hide us ?  In a pigsty!  Literally in a 

pigsty on the grounds.And so we  stayed there with rats all ov
er  

the place.We stayed there for two or three days and nights.By 

that time, you  k now, my parent s were getting w or d from this  man 

that he was getti ng nervous about this whole business and he wasn't 

sure how long  he could keep us.  A nd then the next day he told u s, 

you know, a ne w development had t aken place.  The  whole thing h as 

been called off and everybody can come out and that a deal had been 

 
 
 
 
24
 
struck with the Jewish leadership  that instead of  the Jews being  
deported, that the Jews from that section of Slovakia, eastern  

Slovakia would  be  required to move  to the  west.  So for a  while, it  

was a question, do you believe h im, do you trust  him?  Because 

trickery had been
---
or do you trust the announcement?Was it set  

up so that peopl e would come out  of hiding? and then they would 

catch them all.  But they decided to come out and most people  

decided to come out and it turne d out to be true.  This was an  

instance where  so me of the top Jew ish leadership  di d negotiate, y ou 

know, about the situation.The re ason they decided at that point 

to try and deport  the Jews from t hat area was beca use the Russia n  

front was approac hing.  And so the  unreliable  Jews had to be gotten  

rid of.  Also, this was a time w hen the transpor ts from Hungary  

were going through Slovakia to Auschwitz so it seemed like a 

convenient time t o hook up a few c ars to those  trai ns.  But a deal 

was made and it was true and everybody had to move to the western 

part of Sl ovakia except people  who  had certa in exem ptions even  then.   

Like doctors  and  dentists, p harm acists; they  cou ld remain an d be 

exempt.  I mention that because in fact what happened was that 

later on, those exemptions were no longer valid and most of those 

people really did not survive.B ecause they were so isolated and 

hadn't learned
--t hey
'd been exem pt  all the way thro ugh really
--and  

they hadn't learn ed the art of  su rviving.  So our  family moved to 

a town in western  Slovakia whic h i s called Neitr a ( ph)(c.51).  The 

reason they chose  that is bec ause that's where my  f ather's Gentile  

partner came from.  That's where his family still lived and he 

wanted to go  back  there.  So not o nly us then,  but the partner, in  

fact, all the ap prentices moved together with th e shop.  Because  

their training st ill depended on completing their apprenticeship. 

And
 
so we all moved to Nitra (c.57).  After a while , we got a place 
to live and this  is an important  part of the story.  My parents 

found a place to  live in this  kind  of a  complex, so rt of a  little 

housing complex that had a
--
was walled off from the street with a 

gate through the  wall. lnside the r e was a co uple of  yards.  On one 

end of the yard,  there was a det ached, very smal l house which is  

where we lived.  Across from the yard was a larger house, one  

section of which, there was a big room where thefour app
rentices  

that came with myfather, lived.  A djoining them was where a railway 

conductor and hi s family lived a nd the apprentic es arranged for 

board by this railway conductor's wife.Around the  corner and on 

the other side o f this railway conductor's family , was a machine  

tool shop.  Now t his was all withi n one enclos ed co mplex.  Now the  

whole place was  o wned by a woman w hose husband had been a communist  

 
 
 
 
25
 
during the first  Czechoslovakian  republic.  And he was afraid of  
persecution for  b eing a communi st.   So when they bu ilt this house, 

they specifically  built it with a hiding place that might be used 

potentially by  h im.  The  hiding  place was  a  sp ace within  the 

structure of  the house that you co uld get into from  the apprentices '  

room.  There was a kind of a closet that was set  into the wall, 

really more like  an armoire or s omething like th at, set into the 

wall.  And you op ened it up an d it  seemed to end wh ere it ended in 

the back but actually it was a false door that if you pushed it  

aside, you got  in to this space  whi ch was the  hiding  place.  Now in 

terms of size,  I suppose I should  use feet, maybe  you can translate  

it.  It was about  as wide as f rom  here to maybe  th e other side of 

your chair tha t y ou are sitting  on .  That's as wide  as it w as.  In 

terms of length,
 
it was from say t his wall down to about the end of 
the rug t here.  S o it was  a  relati vely small  space;  it had no  access 

to the outsi de.  The walls were da mp with mois ture.   At any rate
--

when we
--
when my  parents got thi s place this wom an who rented it 

out 
to them, who  owned it, who d idn't live there,  told them abou t  
this hiding place .  Apparently, th e railway conduct or's family  and 

his family also knew about this hiding place.  So t hen what happened 

was this; afte r we had lived  the re for a  little while, som
ebody  

came and told my parents that they had heard one of the big shots 

in the local fas cist guard, obviously drunk.  He  started yelling  

and screaming in  the marketplace, about how the day  will soon come 

when he will come  to this whole co mplex and get all of the Jews and 

communists out.  When my parents heard this story, they immediately  

realized, they had to do somethingabout this.  You could not afford 

to have an important person like that out gunning for you.So m y  

father went to s ee him with his partner with the  idea of somehow  

buying his goodw ill, with gifts or bribe.  The man wouldn't hear 

anything of it.  Apparently what was clear was t hat he had some 

grudge against t he woman who owned this place.  He felt she had  

cheated him ou t some years bef or e of something  a nd he was still 

holding a bitter grudge against her.So when my father's partner  

came back, my mot her who was sort of canny in these ways said to my 

father, that he ought to go back by himself.That the reason the  

man didn't take a  bribe wa s
 
that  h e didn't want a  w itness.  So my 
father did go  bac k and my f ather w as very charming and engaging and  

listened to his c omplaints about  t his woman  and sai d, oh ye s, you're  

absolutely right;  and then offe red  him a couple  of  rings.  By the 

time my father
 
l eft, you know, h e was friendly a s he could be, 
towards my fat her .  Now this is im portant because  h e appears again 

in the scene.  T he other thing  th at's important is  this; and her e 

 
 
 
 
26
 
again my mother was really a ver y determined sur vivor and what 
happened was when  we moved to western Slovakia, of course, all Jews 

who had moved ove r there were requ ired to r egister.   There  would be  

a very severe penalty for those failing to register.  Now my parents 

had learned already from the previous experience that certainly the  

police followed the registration  lists when they  went to pick up  

the Jews.  So my  mother was  determined that we  w ere not going  to  

register period.  But there was  su ch a pressure fro m everybody, to 

go along, not to  cause trouble t hat one day ther e was
 
this area 
where there was  a  Jewish soup  kitc hen and school  and so and t here's 

where the regist ration took place.  There was
--
o ne day my mother  

saw my father in line to register.  And she made a big stink and he 

finally stepped out of the line and we didn't register which 

probably also  hel ped.  Because wha t happened  was th is;  again this  

is part of history.  There was the Slovak resistance suddenly  

erupted.  The Ger mans marched in , came in, took a m uch more direct  

role in the gover ning of the count ry.  Also, came t o fight off  the 

resistance becaus e suddenly the resistance was taking over a fairly 

big chunk of  terr itory but not  the  town where we we re.  But people 

knew things  were going to get bad.  Now  the firs t d ay that my sister  

and I were suppos ed to start
 
off in school, Septem ber of 1944, w e  
were late going to school.Sudden ly my father comes back, having 

already left to go to work, in p anic.  He had ap parently stopped  

off at the barber .  The barber sta rted lathering hi s face and  then 

told him about the J
ews--
they're taking the Jews.My father said  

take the soap, l ather off.  He came right back but if we hadn't 

heard about this  police big shot  b eing after us, he  would have  been 

there six o'cloc k that morning t o get us.  If my father hadn't 

succeeded in winn ing him over.  If  we had registere d, they probably 

would have been  t here fairly early  too.  In fact, they never came  

to pick us up of ficially because  we were not on the registration 

lists.  But when we
--
my father c om e back
--
what to  d o, where to  go? 

For 
some reason, I guess my pare nts really didn' t quite trust
--
although this ra ilway conductor,  not long befor e, had told my  

father, Henry, d on't worry, if t rouble comes, we 'll hide you.  I 

guess they didn't  trust it because  their decision was that we would 

go
 
to the house o f my father's partner's parents.  They had a house 
on the other si de  of town, on  the outskirts with so me orchards and  

so on.  Again, we  broke up  into  th ree groups;  my si ster and I, my  

father alone, my mother alone, to make the journey across
 
the town.  
I do remember  tha t, because eve ryw here you saw  poli ce cards.  They 

were picking up Jews everywhere.   One time, it seemed to me at 

least, like the p oliceman in the c ar looked at us f or a while before  

 
 
 
 
27
 
he decided to go  on.  Finally we all got there and they put us, 
these people, th ey agreed to hide us and they put us in an open 

kind of shed  in t heir orchard.  Th at night was  mise rable, was cold  

and we kept heari ng noise of peopl e going
--
obviousl y being in th e  

woods and coming closer and closer and b
ranchescra ckling.  Fina lly  

totally panicked by it, made them
--
these people tak e us inside.  We 
heard later on  th at there had  been  thieves in  the orchard all night  

and that's what we were hearing. We stayed there for a couple of  

days, two or thre e days.  Then the se people said, w e can't keep you 

anymore. We' re a fraid what will h appen to us.We ' ve got an idea 

for you, a place  to hide.  We know of this plac e, in an attic,  

there are 24 peop le, I'm sure they 're take you too.   Here again, my 

parents, particularly my mother  re sponse was, I'm  n ot going there.  

If you know  about  this place  and y ou have no  business knowing about  

that hiding place , that place is n' t going to be goo d for very long  

at all.  In fact ,  it wasn't
--
withi n a week  or two  i t was raided  and 
ev
erybody... Then  my parents said,  can we  stay  unti l dark?  No, y ou  

have to leave right away.So we made the trek back to our place 

again in the thre e groups and  again still polic e al l over the  place.   

We got back and at that point, t his was a Saturd ay afternoon, my  

parents did appro ach the railway  c onductor and said , look, we w ant  

to hide out in t his hiding place .  He and his f amily had to be  

involved because we had to be fed aside from the f a ct that he knew  

about the pla ce.  So he said, no w ay.  Was pleading  back and  forth  

but he was ad aman t, no way.  Then at some point,  he  goes off for  a 

walk with his se ven
-
year
-
old dau ghter.  This was one time, you 
know, where  I rea lly did feel ever ything was  lost.  My parents  jus t  

had no idea what the hell to do.  Waiting, at any time, for a knock 

to come on the ga te.  Suddenly we hear a knock  on t he door.  Since  

the gate hadn't opened, we were pretty sure, it wasn't the police 

and it wa s one of  the appr entices.  He told u s why  don't yo u come  

into that hiding  place, we'll
 
hi de you.  So of course, we went.   
Then it became a matter as the other apprentices made their 

appearance of te sting each one of them out to se e how they felt 

about it.  They all agreed.  Of course, they were all offered  

generous weekly subsidies while we
 
were in there .  Like making 
about four times  as much  as the y  were at  their j obs.  Then th e 

question was to  a pproach the railw ay conductor's wi fe while he was  

out on his w alk.  Because without her being in  on i t, there was no  

way--
that wasn't  going to work
 
eit her.  She was off ered a generou s 
compensation for it, probably much  more money than her husband wa s  

making at the  rai lway.  Again, thi s was important .  My father had  

the shop all this time and able to make the money.I think they 

 
 
 
 
28
 
were smart to offer the money ininstallments beca use at the same 
time who asked p eople to hide th em for all the money they had. 

People took the money and called the police.So then
--
but partly 

they agreed, I think, partly the y did feel for us and so on and 

there was certainly some charitabl e feeling involve d, but also at 

that point there  was still the s ense of maybe it 'll be all over,  

that the partisan s might actually  win and the wh ole  thing would be 

over after a cou ple of weeks.  So we were  there
--
we were in that  
hiding place wit hout every budging from that pla ce for two full 

months.  We were mostly all lying  down to be a ble t o fit into that 

place. The woman  would bring us the food in a laundry basket and  

so on.  Of course, it wasn't kos her food, it was pretty good, I 

must 
say and it was okay to eat it because you had to.  Then, in 
terms of our elimination functions , we had a chamber pot and used 

that all day.  T hen in the eveni ng, one of the a pprentices would  

get rid of the waste.  So, as I say, for two full months, we didn
't 

budge out of there.  Then I became  sick with fever,with high fever.  

My parents sta rte d worrying abo ut that.  I remember  that very  well 

because there was  a lot of anxiety .  I remember sweating like a pig 

at some point and  thinking th at me ant I was  really going to die .  I  

didn't know that meant my fever was breaking.   That was after they 

had sent one of  t he apprentices ou t to get some kin d of anti
-
fever  
medication.  Because the fear was, you know, if you call in a  

doctor, you could n't be sure, he w ould turn you in.   After that, my 

parents decided i t was not very  he althy to just s ta y in that place  

so we moved over into the apprenti ces' room.A cou ple of them, I 

guess, moved so me where else in  the  complex.  A coup le of them  were 

staying with us in that room wit h the idea that if necessary, in  

time of crisis,  w e could run into the hiding.  For the next period  

of time and now this was after
--
I  mean the t otal time we were  in 
that hiding was  n ine months.  But there was a perio d of time there 

where we would then
 
particularly if the railway conductor,
--
and the  
fact that he was away most of  the time
--
made it  pos sible to main tain  

this arrangement.   But we kept hea ring stories from  the apprentices  

about how this hi ding place was ex posed, these peop le were taken ,  

thos
e people wer e taken.  One never
--
every day t hat could happen  

with us.  At some  point, one of the boys, in fact the boy who asked 

us to come in
--
t here were storie s coming up that  pretty soon the 

Germans were go in g to conscript  ab le
-
bodied Gentile  Slovakians
 
for  
labor in German y to help with  the war effort.  He c ertainly didn't  

want that.  So he wanted to be able to use the hiding place for  

himself, if nece s sary, so he asked  us to lea ve.  At that point, my 

parents said to  h im, okay, George ,  we'll go but you know very  well, 

 
 
 
 
29
 
they're going to  catch us very q uickly.  I'm sure they'll ask us  
where were you?  We'll tell them.  Aside, of course, from the  

possible punishme nt for hiding, which really never
--
it was always 

threatened but I never heard of anybody who really got shot or 

anything like th at for hiding Je ws.  But the hid ing place was no  

good.If the off icials, knew, it wouldn't be any good for him so  

there was no reas on for him then  t o pay off in his  asking.  For a 

while then, occas ionally at night,  we would actu all y go out in  the  

yard for a walk.  I remember  for t he first time, fr esh air t hat I  

hadn't seen for  m onths.  But then,  one day, the  Ge rman army moved 

into that complex .  They took o ver  the place where we had lived and 

there was a leat her shop, they m ade there.  They took over the 

machine tool sho p and had some o ther kind of sho p and the whole 

yard was patrolle d by a German sentry all the time.There was no  

way, obviously, t hat we could  ever  go out of  that r oom.  That room 

had a kind of a porch between
 
it self and the yard but you could 
see, you know, th rough the window you could...
 
 

Was there any lig ht?That's w hat I was going to as k you.
 

 

Very little light  in that room.  Certainly no ligh t in the hidin g  

place,, at all  ot her than from  a c andle, no elect ri c lights.  Then 

there was a room  which was relat ively dark becau se there was, in 

fact, a porch, not a screened porch but a glass enclosed porch 

beyond that.  There was a little  window between the room and the  

glass enclosed po rch as well as, I think, some gla ss on the door.  

But you could  se e through that  w indow, you cou ld  see the  German 

sentry out the re.   At one time, i n the evening,  y ou know, one  of 

the apprentices w as on his way fr om the railway co nductor's house  

from his meal  bac k to his p lace.  The German sentr y  said, halt  and 

he got panicked  a nd he kept  runnin g towards the  room where we  were.  

Finally he stopped at the doorstep but he could have walked right 

in.Then what h a ppened was that.. .Then the next  crisis was the 

woman who owned t he place suddenly  showed up and s he found out w e  

were there and ev erything.  She sa id she had to sell the place, she 

had big debts and  the only way  she  could get out  of  it that she  had 

to sell th e pla ce.  In  fact,  s he did and  the  new owners  were 

supposed to take  over the first  of  April of 1945.  But then around  

November of '44,  December, we be gan to hear the artillery, the 

Russian artillery .  But really th e front stalled for the winter 

about 35 miles,  4 0 miles from  wher e we were.  And t hen one day, we 

heard sirens and  planes all over  t he place and  a big bombing attack  

took place.  Befo re that there hadbeen air raids ofAmerican Flying  

 
 
 
 
30
 
Fortresses that kept flying over to Weinernorstach  (ph)(c.297) to 
bomb the armament s factories  there .  We  had gott en used to t he fact
 
that, you know, nothing every ha ppened there.  But this time, it  

was different, low
-
flying planes and suddenly we're being bombed.  
There was no base ment we could go to, windows were all broken.  But 

that was the sta rt of the Russia n offensive, whe re the front had 

been stalled for  all that time.  Then the questi on was, at that 

point, let's see  what happened
--
we could no long er hide from the 
railway conductor  that we were ar ound.  Of cours e , with the  war  

about to be over , he had no more  objections to o ur be
ing there.  

Because one of t he things th at p ropaganda, German  propaganda was  

very--
would have you believe that  when they came  in , whatever Jews  

were left would  become kings.  Anybody who ha d anything to d o 

against them wou ld be severely p unished.  I guess it was to keep  

the motivation on  their side becau se a lot of peop le were in som e  

way implicated  e ven though p eopl e had taken  over  Jewish prop erty 

and so forth.  By  the way, at that  point, everybod y  was looking  to 

have a good deed,  you know,  on the ir side because. . .  So we were
--

so at some point particularly afte r the second night when the front 

started, there wa s shelling all ni ght, you know, just big flares of 

light, big explos ions and there was no where to hide.So at some  

point my parents  decided to go and the other pe ople
--
they were 

connected with  the other  ap prentices
--
went to the railway  

conductor's new house which had a basement which was about a mile 

or so away.  At some point, we d ecided to join.  But when we got  

there, we starte d hearing storie s that the Germa ns were going to  

come by and colle ct men again  for work.  But they w ould have found  

us there, that's  no hiding place .  So my parents  decided that we  

had to go back t o the original p lace.   By that point one of the  

apprentices becam e the one that my parents really c ame very much to 

trust and rely  up on.  He said wher ever you go,  I wi ll go with you. 

He came back wit h us and it was taking some chan ce because there  

was a curfew.  Ju st any patrol  tha t had stopped us could have shot  

us just for having the curfew viol ation.  Anywa y, i n another couple 

of days because o f the heavy shel l ing and so on,  an d total lack of 

protection there,  we decided to go back again tothe other place. 

For the next two days, there was bombing and shelling and so on and 

fin
ally there  wa s silence on e mo rning.  We look e d out and there 

were the  Russian soldiers and the liberation of tha t town t ook place  

on March 31. Rem ember the April f irst deadline?
 
 

Yeah, yeah.
 
 

 
 
 
 
31
 
Just as a little p ostscript
--
sort o f presaging thi ng s to come.  
 
When  
we were liberated  that day and ca me out into the open, my parent s  
felt what if ther e is a  counter at tack and we  were  now out in  the 

open and Germans  temporarily ret ake this place?   So they wanted 

to find some w ay  of moving fur the r back behind the  lines.  Having 

believed all thi s German propaga nda about how wh en the Russians 

came in, they we r e so wonderful f o r the Jews, my  fa ther set out to 

the Russian  head quarters to  find  out if  it i s possible to  be 

transported back further behind the lines.He runs
 
into a couple 
of Russian soldie rs and asks them,  where is the headquarters.  T hey 

ask him, who are  you? why are you  asking?  My fathe r says wh y I'm  

Jewish, expecting  then to be treated royally.  On e of the soldiers,  

they were both p retty drunk, poi nts his
 
automati c gun at him and 
says, you're Jewi sh, I'm going to  kill you.  He c ould easily have  

done that the first day after, you know,...But hi s pal said let  

him go.  So my f ather no lo nger looked for the h eadquarters  but  

came back and we kept our fingers
 
crossed.  Of cour se, there was no 
counter
-
offensive because this was  really the beginn ing of the final  
very quick retrea t and defeat of t he Germans. 
 

 

It's a wild story .  
 

 

Yes, it is a wild  story.
 

 

You do have a couple of picture s of relatives.  Are there any 

relatives that yo u would like to talk about, that w e could possibly 

include in our pr oject, do you thi nk?
 

 

Well, there's on ly
--
I mean none of them
--
as I sa id, there's only  

one survivor.
 
 

I mean of the ones who perished. Would you know enough about any  

of them to discus s?
 

 

Well, I can say little things about them.  One cousin who did  

survive, his par ents and sister  both died.  I do remember his  

parents, his fath er was a very goo d person.  Th ey had a pastry shop 

that I us ed to go  to and  finagle  l ittle gifts  of pa stry.  My aunt  

used to make  ice cream every mor ni ng, the old
-
fas hi oned way.  As I 
remember it to be the most delicious ice cream that I had ever had.  

My cousin, their daughter, who was  at that point about seventeen or 

eighteen, whom I  mentioned before,  who had hid  out during the
---he  

was very much wan ted to survive an d tried very hard  not to be taken.   

 
 
 
 
32
 
I don't remember  the exact circu mstances but she  did get taken. 
These relatives I  mentioned before , my mother's younger sister whose  

wedding picture  you saw, s he wa s a very  pretty  woman.  Their  

daughter, I menti oned, I mentioned  who was ver y, ve ry cute
--
at on e  

point she and I played a fair am ount together.  She kept talking  

about she wanted to marry me like little girls of t hat age would.
 
 

What 
was her name ?
 
 

Eva.  Called her Evitcha.  (c.402) .  Those were the relatives that 

I was closest to
--
perished.
 
 

Certainly tragic.
 
 

Yeah.
 

 

Are there any  oth er incidents, or  episodes, images which stand out  

in your mind  fro m this period  th at you didn't  di scuss, that yo u 

might want to inc lude as part of t he interview? 
 

 

I can't think of any right now.
 
 

Also, did you wan t to discuss a l ittle bit
 
about w hat happened t o  
your family after  the war?
 
 

Yeah, I'll b e gl ad to.  The  thin g that
--
as s oon as the war  was  

over, of course, my parents once again wanted to come to America. 

So that as soon as possible, we ob tained an affidav it again through 

my father's brot her who was livi ng in Minneapoli s.  Things were 

very difficult t here after the w ar.  Very few Je ws were left but  

anti
-
semitism wa s still very, very strong.  There was little 
question in the m inds of my family , anyway, that we  wanted to ge t  

out of
 
there as soon as possible.  But again becaus e of there still  
being that discr iminatory, at th at time, immigration law in the 

U.S. against Slav ic eastern Europe an country, we had to wait a long 

time.   By this t ime, I had begun going to a  gymnas ium, the pu
blic  

state gymnasium w here I was one  of  two Jewish boys  out of about 40  

regular students.   Our main teache r was clearly ver y anti
-
semitic.   
He would have  us take
--
he would ha ve essentially th is other Jewis h  

boy and me take t urns about being the scapegoat. 
 
T here was to some 
extent true  to so me of the  boys.   I had one  friend  who I bef riended,  

a Gentile boy.  W hen we had an arg ument, like boys  will have, what  

he had to say  to me was that I  alw ays thought you w ere a different 

 
 
 
 
33
 
Jew but I guess you're like all the rest.This was after all of 
this had happened .
 

 

Did they have any  knowledge or sen se of what ...?
 
 

Yeah, I think  the y did.  One could  occasionally hea r from someone, 

they didn't finis h the job.  My f ather began a jew elry shop again  

and actually tha t was
 
quite successful for the next two or three 
years.Then we were still there when the communists' coup d'etat 

took place in February of 1948.  Certainly there was a lot of  

anxiety--
I did be come, I must say also, quite activ e in the Zionist 

organization ther e.  It w as the Ak iva that I be long ed to.  Attitude  

had changed towa rd Zionism  because of the exper ience of the war  

although when we  finally left, I,  having been a fer vent Zionist at 

that point really  felt it was a be trayal to come to  America rather  

than 
to go to Pa lestine.  My father didn't think  Palestine would  
survive or th at t he Jewish com muni ty there woul d su rvive.  Anyway, 

within a month o r two after the communists took over, our number 

came up.  I  don' t know wheth er t here was
--
whether  the quota  had  

become accelerate d because of the communists takeov er and this  was  

a few months bef ore they clamped  down on legal emigration from 

Czechoslovakia.  So it was that window of opportunity and we 

essentially legal ly from Czechos lo vakia, I think  ab out April, '48
.  

And the other  thi ng
--
the post
-
war years, I remember  for some, t hat  
was after you su rvive yourself, people kept clin ging to the hope  

that their r elat ives would c one day come bac k.  For many yea rs, 

particularly arou nd holidays, ther e would be a lot of rem
embering 

and weeping about  all lost.
 
 

Well, if there i sn't anything that you'd like to  add, I want to 

thank you very mu ch.
 

 

You're welcome.
