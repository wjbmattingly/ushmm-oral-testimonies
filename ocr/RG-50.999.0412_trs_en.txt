children. On thism ap of Europe, the arrow points to Poland.  On this m ap of 
Poland, thearrow points to Radom . OnSeptem ber 1, 1939, German troops 
invaded Poland and Regina's town was attacked. Likeall Jews in Radom , 
Regina's
 
fam ily was ordered into a newl y created ghetto.  Regina'sparents 
sm uggled heroutby bribing oneof  the guards.  She escaped to Pionki where her 

older sister Rozia lived.  Soon she was conscripted intoforced laborandforged a 
close relationship with Sa

W ith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our 
F i rs t Pe rs on

Regina 
Spiegel.  
 
[Applause]
 
Regina, thank you som uch f or your willingne ss to join u
s and be our 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today. W ehave a really great audience, andwe have a great deal to cover in a 
ver y short period, so we'll just get started right away.  
 
Germ any invaded Poland on September 1, 1939.  Regina, you were 13 years of  
a ge  livin g wit h  
your f am ily in Radom, Poland.  First, let'sbegin with you telling us 
about yourf am ily, your  community and yourself in the years bef orethe war, then 
what happened whenGerm any attacked Poland.  
 
>>
 
Regina Spiegel: T hank you. I welcom e you too, to this group. W hat I want to 
tell you, that them inute the Germ ans cam e intoour town, our life changed 
com pletely.  Becausebefore the war, we li ve d like regular citizens,we had anice

lif e.  My f ather took care of thef am ily.  W e alwa ys had enough to eat. W e lived 
nicely.  But oncethe Germ ans walked in,ourlif e completely changed, as if it 
never existed before.  
 
As am atter off act, if  you think about the 13th of  September, it rem inds you 

probably of
 
going back to school. So was itfor us. All the young children were 
supposedto goback to school.  But you know what
 
--
 
it never happened, because 
thef irstorder of their business was Jewish children were notallowed to go to 
school. You can't imagine.  It'sf ine once in a while, when you don'tfeel like going 
thatday to school, and it's all right with your parents'perm ission.  However, when 
som ebody com esaround andtells you you're notallowed to gobecause you 
happen be born Jewis h, that puts a c
om pletely diff erent thing oneverything you're 
doing, because you know that you are in a lot of  trouble.  
 
Like m y older sisters form ed groups in the cellars in order to teach the kids, 
because they were kids.  This was theirf irst year going to school. But they were 
af raid. They can'tbe serious. So they want in ordernot tom iss anything, they 
told them , so they should be able to keep upwith the learning.  However, they 
needn'thave bothered, because childrenas a whole were their f irst victims.  
 
I d
on't know why they were so af raid of kids. Kids cannot do anything.  But that's 
what they did.

>> Bill Benson:  Regina, you told me that your father lost his job almost overnight.  
T ell us how you were able to
 
--
 
how he was able to provide foodforyou,
 
how you 
were able tom ake ends m eet oncehe lost his work.  
 

>> Regina Spiegel:  It was ver y hard, becausef irst of all the banks closed up right 
away, so even if  you had a little bit of m oney in the banks you couldnotaccess, 
you hadnoaccess to them. 
  
Of course, but it was ratherhard, but we wer e able to barter with the neighbors.  
You know, like m y m other, usually in Europe,to thisday I think, everything that 
you had, anything like this or this
 
--
 
I m essed up.  OK.  
 
[Laughter]
 
OK.  Anything like this I'm  wearing was probably m adeof  goldor silver, so you 
were able tobarter with ourneighbors to getus som efood. But it was terrible. 
From  them inute they walked in, we knew we were in trouble.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Regina, it would notbe too long before you and yourf am ily were 

forced to go into a ghetto. Tell us what the ghetto was like, what theconditions 
were like f or you and yourfam ily going there. 
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Do I have to?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just alittle.  
 
>> Regina Spiegel: W ell, you know, one daythey decided to
 
--
 
because they saw 
that somehow we're managing, you know, like I said bartering with our neighbors, 

you m anaged. But putting us into the ghettos was really so terrible because you

we were a fairly large fam ily. W e were eight of us.  They put in another 
fam ily with us, so asa result when they cam e in the evening 
--
 
andwe only got 
like one room f oreverybody.  So when they cam e in theevening toput your head 
down, to go to sleep, it wasn't enough room for everybody.  
 
So right away, it was so horriblethat I can'teven describe it.  Because, you know, 
I was still at that time a kid, and I was even then happy, because aslong as I was 
with m y f am ily it was OK for m e, because If iguredm y fam ily is going to take care 
of  m e .   
 
T his soon changed,becausem y m otherapproachedm eand she said " Regina, 
you have to leave theghetto."   I said"W hy?"
 
She wouldn't
 
--
 
you know, parents in those years didn't sitdown, like m y kids do 
with their children,explain everything
 
exactl y wh y we have to do that.  She said 
" You're doing it, and there is no questioning."  AndI said
 
--
 
I had a sister who was 
two years older than I was, and If igured why do you pickonm e justbecause I'm 
the youngest one? But no, she som ehow
 
--
 
I d o
n't know what she saw in m e that 
I never realized that she f igured thatmaybe Ihave the best chance 
 
Actually, when I couldn't doanything, I was so angry with her that when I lef t I just 
tookoff m y arm band, because in those years you hadto wear an arm b
and that 
showed that you were Jewish.  So I tookoff m y arm bandand just lef t. I never 
said goodbye tom y parents.  
 
You know what?  To acertain degree, this keptm e alive all that tim e, because I 

8 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  
TRAN S CRIPT
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
said Ihave to live to see m y parents,because If elt so guilty, because I f igured 
later on that she probably didn't
 
--
 
that she did it because it was betterf or me. So 
I lef t.  
 

I got tom y sister's, who lived in a littletown, it was called Pionki.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Regina, I'm going to stop youf or just am
om ent.  Tell us, you 
walked out of the ghetto, which was not easy to do. Tell us how you  got toPionki.  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Iwalked out,I didn't have apenny to m y nam e.  And just 

what I wore.  I just walked out,and I gottoa train.  In those years,
 
Idon't know, it 
was still warm , it was i n Polandthat during like vacationtim e, that you can travel 

with an adult and youdon'thave to pay, a kid doesn'thave to pay. 
 
So when I cam e on that train,and I looked around, and I saw a lady sitting in the 
side, so I sat down over thereand I startedtalking to her. So when the guard 
cam e in to checkf or the tickets, he didn't even lookatm e, becausehe assumed, I 
think, that I was with her, and because I started talking to her.  He just let me go.  
 
S o  wh
en I cam e to Pionki, I gotoff ,and m y sister actually m etm ethere, and she 
tookm e, because shelived in that little town,she was m arried, andshe lived 
there. She actually had a little boy.  He wasat the tim e18m onthsold.  And she 
had also 
--
 
i t  wa
s terrible, because she had this baby and she knew she couldn't 
bring him  in, in the cam p, so shefound a Polish wom an who took care of the 

baby.  But after a while she,the wom an, tookthebaby tothe gestapo and told 
them  where m y sisterwas.

As a m att
er off act, after the war, I went to see her,asking her"W hy did you have 
to tell them  wherem y sister was?"
 
At least, this way m ayb e she would have hada chance.  
 
And she toldm e she could have never done this, because m y sisterwould have 
never forgi ven herfor that. But it didn't change anything, because when they 
broughtm y sister there, and they actually wantedher to tell thatthis is nother 
baby.  
 
Because, you see,m y sister was working there asa dentist, and they f igured that 

if  they loseher where are they going to replace hernow? T hey wer en't always 
available.  So they wa nted her to say "T his is notm y child," but of course, she 
couldnever do that.  And she andthebaby were killed when she tried to grab the 
baby, when she saw how they're stuff ing everybody into the cattletrains.  She 
f iguredmaybe sheas an adult, because I was a lotof  tim esonthese cattle trains, 
m aybe she as an adult m ight survive.  But the baby would never make it.  
 
So she actually grabbed the baby, shetried to run
 
away, and sheand the baby 
were shot.  Andthat's how I lost, thatI knew thef irst tim e, m y sister.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onceyour sister was denouncedand you losther,you were in 
Pionki, tell us about Pionki and what your lif ewas like there.  
 
>> R e gi n
a Spiegel:  Pionki was a very im portant town.  You know, I never realized 
it heldone of the largest powder munitionf actories in Poland, andtherefore it 
becam ea greatfactor, actually, in m y survi va l andthe survi val of many, many

others,because the Germ ans made the slave labor camp. It was one of these 
cam ps thatm en and wom en actually worked together.  Notm any cam ps that had 
like this.  Most of them they were separated. But inthis particular cam p men and 
wom en worked together.  
 
As a m atter of f ac
t, inthatplaceI metm y husband, because he was f rom another 
town, and he approached m e saying to m e, " Iknow you."   I askedhim ," Are you 
f rom m y town, likef rom  Radom ?"
 
He said" No."  I said"Where are youf rom?"
 
He said" A town in Poland"  which I heardof  it, Kozienice. I said " I was never in 
Kozienice."   
 
I toldhim he's justm aybe saying something. But then he saidI remember you, 
because you worked som eplace with som ebody.  I toldhim , I said,"So tellm e 
what did I wear?"
 
Andhe went to describe m y clothes better 
--
 
if they would have asked me 
" Regina, describe your coat"  I wouldhave never been able to do it.Andhe 
described it with everything, with even m y patch, that I had thepatch in the 
sleeve.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though this was a cam p that allowed bothm en and wom en 

as slave laborers,how did the two of  youhave the opportunity to talk with each 
other?

>> Regina Spiegel:  You see, in a certain time they gave us
 
--
 
you know, af ter 
m any cam psI realized this was probably notoneof  the worst, worst camps, 
because we happened to have somebody wh o took careof us, whohappened to 
be,even though he was a Germ an, lieutenant in the arm y, he still was like he's 
human.  Because we had a lotof  people thatwere watching us, andthey weren't 
a
lwa ys ver y nice to us.  
 
So he cam e out with an order, if  they com e back you can search them , you know, 

when they come backfrom  work, butduring the time that they are in their 
surroundings, in their cam p, you are not to enter there.  
 
T here was a lot of talking about som e people, some of the people that were 

guarding the camp.  Don't forget, we were yo ung, young girls, not so bad looking, 
so som etim es, you know, they wanted to do som ething to us. 
 
He actually stopped them .  Asam atter of fact, alsoaf ter the war we  foundout 

about him , that he, when they tookus,and this was
 
--
 
can I go on?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Mm
-
hm m .   
 
>> Regina Spiegel: W henI was thereand they were tryin g to sendus out 
already, af ter working there, they decidedto sendus to Auschwitz, you know, as 
I'm  talking to you tim e m oves, you know, it moves ver y quickl y, and this was 
already like I cam e into that cam p in 1942, and we were m ovedf rom there in the 
beginning of 1944. Because, apparently, theRussians were com ing in andf rom  
ano
ther site, and theGerm ans were beginning tof eela littlebit of war, something 

12 
 
R OUGH DR AFT

of  t he  wa r .   
 
W hat I started saying about this guy, that he actually went with us. W enever 
knew that we arebeing taken to Auschwitz.  But he was the one that knew, and 
he supposedly went toAuschwitz aheadof  tim eto tell them , when it's com ing, a 
big transportf rom Pionki, don't kill them ,they're ver y good workers, and if you kill 
them  we don't
 
--
 
we need them f orthe production. Therefore, we kind of thought 
that to a ce
rtain degree he helpedus survive , because it was actually true, when 

we cam e to Auschwitz they didn'ttake us. Because, if  you cam etoAuschwitz in 
those years, they would just take youand send you to the ovens. During m ost of 
the tim e.  
 
W ith our tran
sportthey did, they took som epeople that weren't well or older 

people, butthe young onesthey letus go by.  So we managed to get like this to 
theother place, to Auschwit z.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Regina, when you were sent to Auschwitz was Sam  still with 
y
ou?  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Yes.  As am atter off act, we traveled, m y husbandand I,he 

wasn't yet m y husband, I want you to know, but after all it's60
-
som e years and I 
am  so used to referring to him asm y husband, I can't say he is asm y f riend. But 

he was actually m y boyf riend at the tim e.  Asa matterof fact, whenwe cam e into 
Auschwitz and they were doing the selection,andhe sm uggled him self to the
 
--
 
if  
they caughthim ,he wouldhave beenprobably like gone, but whenwe cam e into 

13 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  
TRAN S CRIPT
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
Auschwitz he cam e running tom e.  He said
 
--
 
because he wasf ouryears older 
than I was.  So I think he hadm uchm oreperception of what this cam p looked like 
and what it is.  He said to me, " Regina, if  we ever get out of here,"which nobody 
ever thought,that once you get to Auschwitz you getout, " Meetm e in m y 
hometown."  
 
I turned around very quickly, "W hy notm y town? W hy yours?"
 
[Laughter]
 
You know, when you think back, I know now it's funny, but when you think back 

you say to yourself , why did I dothat? W hy? W hat got intom e to just say this?  It 
didn'tm ake any sense, becauseI have no way to know where I'm  going to wind 
up or what it was. That's what I told him .  
 
For years he couldn'tforget it.  He said" She's still the same Regina."   
 
[Laughter]
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  Regina, when thedecision was made there that you were 
selectedf or labor, what happened next? W hat were you forcedtodo atthat 
point?  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  At that point, we in Auschwit z, it wasn't yet any work, 

because as I say they just brought you to likeanother station, because I didn't 
stay in Auschwitz m ore than six weeks.  But I'll tell you, tobethere six weeks is 
like being som eplacea century, because it was unbelievable.  
 
Men and wom en were right awa y separated. T hat's why I was so wondering that 

14 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  
TRAN S CRIPT
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
m y husband
 
--
 
thatm y boyf riend managed toget over to me. And they put a 
name on you. T ill then I was known as Regina, Rejina in Polish. T hey ga ve m ea 
name,4641. This becam e your nam e.  I will tell youf rom the m inute,f rom zero, 
you hadto know thatnam e, thatnum ber, because if not they could kill you.  
 
As am atter off act, we had to stripnaked,and I want totell you I was already 16 
years old there, and I never, I never stood inf ront,especially of am an, naked.  
Even I don't thinkm y fatherever saw m e naked. And they did that to us. 
 
T his is themost horrible thingf rom  Auschwitz that Ifear,because ittook away, 

like, our
 
--
 
you know, like
 
--
  
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Dign it y.   
 

>> Regina Spiegel:  Exactly.  You know, like dignity.  It m ade youf eel so, so 
horrible. T hat I had som epicturesof m y little nephew andof m y family, because 
we al ways, whenever we ran we had to runwith our pictures,because we wanted 
to always have them next to us.  
 
So Iheldonto this, and this SSm an cam eover to m e saying in Germ an"W hat is 

that?"
 
I really didn't
 
--
 
I said "Nothing"  because I f igured what are m y pictures going to do 
to him ?  You know?  I like tousem y hands too much. 
 
[Laughter]
 
W hat happened,he took it away, he said" You put it down right here"  took all m y 
pictures away.  Nothing.  Like lef t without anything.

W ealso realized this is a place you betterhave som ebody next to you.  So 
whoever was standingnear m ethat was getting these num bers becam e your 
buddy. W e watched out f or
 
one another. W hen they calledm y number, and I 
once was standing around, looking around, she actually hit me andsaying 

" Regina, Ithinkthey mean you."  She already rem em beredm y number, but I 
didn'teven lookat it.  I was so
 
--
 
I was like in another world, like nothing is real.  
Because I was in the cam p, and this was not like a cam p. T he whole place was 

surroundedby electric barbed wire, double.  If you, Godf orbid,m anaged to get 
through one, you hadanother one.  
 
Actually, you know wh at? They were ver y ni ce tous. They always encouraged 

you to touchthe electric barbed wires.  But we saidtoourselves, " You want us 
dead? W e'll show you that if we can, we will stay alive."   And that was our, you 
know, like alm ost, like you say, the thing todo, because Ialways f elt that nobody 
probably knows what's going on here.  
 
W ehave tobe sometim eshereto tell people what was happening,because we 

f igured if people knew, somebody would have come and say " Hey, whatare you 
doing with thesepeople?"
 
B u t  th
ere was no outcry f rom  nobody. W ehad no help, ina way. W e were like 
abandoned people.  
 
Finally, I got out there,yes.

Because the seder teaches us to remember, to remember butto remem berf rom

because that was another campthat apparently when we cam e in they weren't yet

they took you awa y f rom Bergen

>> Regina Spiegel:  No, no, Sam, m y husband went to Gleiwitz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You went to som e other camps, asthe Russians got closer.  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Yes.  Yes. 
 
As it was, you know, the war wasn't  standing still, 
just because Ihada problem  tof indf ood,butthe Russians were moving very f ast, 
and the Germ ans tried to
 
--
 
they still had some Jews to deal with.  So they tried to 
get rid of  us. T hey actually were supposedto takeus to Dachau, either kill us 

thereor whatever, buton the way the bombs, we were attackedby the United 
States and also by other groups, you know, li ke the British. I didn'teven know 
thatthe French were involved in it, because Iwasn't
 
there. So whatever you 
didn't yourself  see, you didn't know that it existed. You know?  
 

Anyhow, over there, while we were bom bed,I thought thatI was dead already.  
But what happened, all of  a sudden som ebody m ust have climbed off me and I 
was able to
 
m ovem y hands.  I said, if youm ove your hands you're still alive.  You 
know?  
 

W elooked, we saw there's som e woodsnottoofarf rom  there. Sowe started 
running towards these woods.  Actually, the Germ ans there usedto tell us, " You 
know, the Americans
 
are not too f ar f rom  here, and they m ight

you know what

R OUGH DR AFT

they're going to doto you, because you workedfor us."   
 
I was thinking tom yself , you worked with us so many years, don't worry anymore.  
I'll let the Am ericans take careof m e, rather than you.
  
But it didn'twork out like 
th is.  
 
W edid run into the woods.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Regina, before youtell usabout going into the woods and being 

liberated, when your train was bom bed there's some signif icance tothefact that it 
was Hitler's birthday.  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Oh, yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ill you tell us about that? 
 
>> Regina Spiegel: T hat's why they told us,we're going to gi ve you anextra 
pieceof  breadto celebrate Hitler's birthday.  He remembersm ore than I do.  
 
[Laughter]
 
He said"W e will gi ve you an extra piece of bread,"  but then when they started 
really bom bing, they forgot about thisbread or the water, thatthey were supposed 
to give us, you know, m ake like apartyf or Hitler, because they hadto run too, 
they run away too, becausehad we known we didn't evenhave to run. But we 
were so af raid that we run into the woods,and we stayed there.  
 
T hen we realized we have nothing, we're going to die right here in the woods. 

T hen I decided to goout.  You know, you have always to have one that will do the 
f irst one.  So I walked out of  the group, and Ilooked aroundand in the 

21 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  
TRAN S CRIPT
 
NOT  VE R BA T IM  R E C OR D
 
 
background I see a soldier, but he didn't wear a Germ an unif orm.  
 
So I ran over tohim, I said letm ef ind out.  He said"T he war is over .  You go into 
the 
woodsand tell everybody to com e out." Apparently, they knew thatthere 
were a bunch of wom en there, buteven though we kept on saying " Be quiet,don't 

talk"  but youhave 500 wom en in that place, you can't keep quiet, really.  
 
So they knew, but they were
 
af raid, because they thought thatm aybe there's 
som e Germ ans there. So they forget, Idon'tblame them, the war is over, wh y get 

killed by the Germ ans?  Theyf igured thesepeople will com eout.  And we actually 
did com eout. W efound out that we aref reed by the Russians. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So here you were just com ing outof  the woods, theRussians say 

you're liberated, you're free.W hatdid thatmean? W hat do you do?  
 
>> Regina Spiegel: W hat do youdo? I wentinto a bakery, and I said to them , 

" Ca
n we have som e bread?"
 
Andhe said tom e, inGerm an, I understooda little bit, he said, " Doyou have 

m oney?"
 
I sa id ,"W ha t's tha t?"
 
I didn't know.  Ididn't have m oney.  But thenwhen we walked in with the Russian 
soldier, he told them "Give these girls som ebread."  Once he told them, we got 
som e bread.  
 
Our diet, we didn'tneed too much.  If you had a piece of breadand a little bitof  
water, that was ourm enu.  W edidn't need any m ore, because that's what we

that's why a lot of  survivors that were actually liberated by the Am ericans, 
anda lot of them diedbecause they startedfeeding them . W ithm e, with the 
Russians, I will tell you truthfully they didn't have toom uch them selves.  So they 
couldn't give you

som etim esthey would offer someth

because you could see the way the Russianswere dressed, with the shoes, like

any boots every m onth or whatever, nothing like being

whether livi ng in America 
or being liberatedby Am ericans. T here's nocom parison. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you decide to go to Sam 's hom etown or to yourhometown?  
 
>>
 
Regina Spiegel:  No, as it worked out, Ibecame owner of ahorse and buggy.  
So we had, instead of walking, you had to walk so much, so we would take turns, 
ever ybody at differenttim es would change. Iwould walk, som ebody else would 
m ove the horse, because the horse didn't have too muchfood,notf rom us. So 
he couldn't move toom uch either.  
 
W hen we actually, we find out we were able to get back, andI did get back to a 

train, and I lef tm y horse with the thing onthestation, and I was justgoing to

because the trains were sof ull, to go to m y town, but all of asudden 
som ebody f rom  theother side of the tracks recognized m eand yelled out, "Hey, 

Regina!  Your boyf riend is alive!"
 
So I said"W here ishe?"
 
He said," In his hometown, Kozienice."
  
He wentback. You see, heran away

eventually it started com ing, all these goodies to you,and I got very sick, and they 

tookm etoa hospital, andthis doctor came in.  Again, he offered me abar of

He happened tobe in the CIA with the Am erican soldiers already.  And he said

was the last tim e you saw your fam ily. W hendid you learn what happened to

day night, and everybody disappeared.  It'sunbelievable. So I never had to 
conf rontm y m other.  
 
I used to go on the March of  theLiving with young people, taking themon the

which we call it March of  the Living, as opposed to Marchof  the Dead, because 
they usually hadthe death march.  
 
I will tell you, it was what adiff erence. T hesekids learned so much,when they

I'm  thinking about some ofthe other

Because he was actually

they tried to indict him ,because he was a higher rank 
in the Germ an arm y, so he probably had maybe other things.  But this I say, in 

thatparticular camp he was wonderf ul,and he had witnesses that cam e, and they 
talkedabouthim , thatwe didn't know, because we were never pri vate to him.  He 
never told us "T hat's what I am  doing."  But we realized that he, to acertain

they were bad people.It is otherwise, I never looked.  
 
W ecouldn't have survi ved on our own.  Because when you think back, in oneof

when they took us outf rom  that camp, wesaid where are we going tof ind 
another benef actor like this?  He lef t me apiece of apple anda piece of  bread

actually they came towork there.  
 
You see,Germany had a lot of work.  So they cam e to work.  Not like us.W e 

were slaves.  
 
Do you know, that that's how we sur vi ved, that we had,throughthe tim eand very

>> Bill Benson: T he question is how did youwalk out of  the ghetto?  You were 13 

years of age.  
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  I know.  I know.  First of all, I will tell you, m y si ster, the one 

that was in Pionki, shewas a dentis
t.   S h e
 
--
 
you know, thefarm ers in Poland 
didn't really use that much dentists, because,let'sf ace it, it's very expensive here, 

and it was expensive there too. So they didn't go todentists.  
 
But allof  a sudden, who, during the war, really has thebest?  Young people, you 

should beable toanswer this to me. Thefarm ers, really, because they have the 
stuff  that people needduring the war. T hat'sall you think is aboutfood, having 
foodf or the kids, having foodfor yourf am ily or whatever it was.  S
o you alwa ys

So this guy com es into her off ice,and he said to her, " Rozia,"  calledher by her 
f irst nam e,"T ake a look with m y teeth."   Shesaid " I will tell you what, it won't cost 
you a penny.  You justhelp m y sister get outfrom  the ghetto."  And that's whenhe 
went, becausehe said" How I'm  going to do that?"
 
She said" Youf ind a way."  Because the onethat guarded our ghettos, itmight 

have been a cousin ofhis, or a wonderf ulf riend.  You know?  So you have to 
know that this was,
 
infact, too. So that's how.  Because I was never one to run. I 
was al ways, I don't know, ver y

you know, I was never a f ighter.  Inever even, as
