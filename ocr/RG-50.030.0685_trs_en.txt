Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Mr.
 Arvydas Kliore
, on February 18
th
, 2013, in 
Sherman Oa ks
,
 California
. And 
Mr. 
Kliore
, thank you very mu ch
 for agreeing to speak with us today. 
Answer: My pleasure. 
Q: Can you Œ we™ll be-begin  at the beginn
ing. Can you tell me when you were born, 
where you were born, a little 
bit about your family, who were your parents, if you 
had any siblings. 
A: I was born in 
Ka una s
,
 Lithuania
 in 1935, and my 
father was from the 
Aukıtaitija
 region, from a small village Œ 
Q: Called? 

A: Œ near ki Œ i-it™s 
Buteniai
. 
Q: 
Buteniai
, which is near 
Krekenava
, and Œ and the Œ th-tha
t Œ the next bigger 
city, I guess. And it™s between 
Kedaynyay 
and 
Panev
¡
žy s
 some where. And his 
father was the village carpenter, and also 
he worked on Œ I re
member he worked on 
the organ of the church  in 
Padagai
, which is a kind of historic church because it 
was one of the flashpoints of the 1905 re
volt against the tsar, and has since then 
become a famous church in preserving litu rgical items d u ring the Soviet era. And 

I™ve been there a couple of times
, and this in fact is wher
e my grandfather, his father 
is buried.

Q: Was your dad also a carpenter? 
A: No. 

Q: No. What was Œ what was his profession?  
A: My father was Œ he Œ he went Œ he was 
the first, of course, member of the family 
to be Œ to go to higher education, he went
 to the teacher™s colle
ge and then onto the 
university in 
Ka un a s
, and he became a teacher. So 
his Œ his profession was teacher, 
although you know later he became more 
of an administrato
r and inspector of 
schools, and then he Œ he was official at
 Œ in the Ministry of Education fo r some 
time. Now, my mother was also a 
teacher, in fact, she was born in 
Slovakia
 
[indecipherable]
. And she grew up th ere,
 but then went to 
Kaunas
 a-at the 
teacher™s college and th Œ also
 university. We Œ we go to 
[indecipherable]
. Also 
became a teacher and in fact that™s how th
ey met, they were teaching in the same 
place in Œ in 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Lithuania
, and that™s when they got married. 
Q: Can you reme mb er the dates of their bi
rths? That is, were they born after 1900? 
A: Oh yes, they Œ th ey were born Œ ma-m
a Œ my  mo ther was born in 1908, and my  
father 1910. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah. And of course, they™re
 Œ they™re both passed on now. 
Q: And did you have br
others and sisters?

A: Yes, I have one twin sister. 
Q: You™re a twin? 

A: Twin, yes. And she lives in 
Florida
. 
Q: What™s her name? 

A: 
Ramute
(ph) Œ 
Ra mune
(ph). 
Q: 
Ramune
(ph). 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah, uh-huh. And Œ 
A: Yeah, so we Œ we get together, of c
ourse, you know, in the Œ fortunately she 
does not look like I do. 
Q: Oh co me now, oh come now. 
A: Not identical. 

Q: Tell me Œ tell me w h at yo
ur earliest memories are. 
A: Well, you know, it™s Œ it™s hard to talk
 about the earliest 
memories, because I 
don™t Œ there are memo ries which come a
nd go. No really permanent memories, but 
in fact, I do remember things at Œ after th
e Soviet Œ during the Soviet occupation we 

were in Œ in, the first Sovi
et occupation, we lived in 
Kaunas
, and th en we moved to 
Vilnius
, where my father worked at 
the Ministry of Education. 
Q: Under the Soviet occupation? 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore

A: No, th is was at Œ after the Germans moved in and we Œ it™s Œ became possible to 
go to 
Vilnius
 after that, yeah. Before then
 it was Polish and you know Œ 
Q: I™m going to step back a little b it a
nd get our Œ get some 
dates established. 
A: Okay . 
Q: I™ll still go back to Œ I 
wanted to dwell a little bit on pre-war. So I understand 
that it™s hard to say, wh ich was my  firs
t me mory and which was my  second. But as 
a child, do you have any memo ries before
 any war, before a
ny occupation? Just 
something personal from your home life,
 from school perhaps, or children or 
parents? 

A: Well, I do Œ I have 
very few memories of 
Kaunas
 for instance. But do Œ during 
the latter part of Œ of my parents™ life i-in 
Kaunas
, we lived in 
Panemun
¡
, which is 
like a suburb of 
Kau nas
. And I remember th at, we lived in a Œ rented a Œ a Œ a 

house there, and there was Œ I remember 
there was a little park
 there with newly 
planted conifer trees. And there was a statu e of Œ was an 
[indecipherable]
. And I 
reme mb er that Œ that Œ that Œ that the trees
 were about the same 
size as the height of 
the statue. And of course, when I came ba
ck there 40 or 50 years later, the trees 
were as high as the sky and th
e statue was about this tall Œ 
Q: Yeah.

A: Œ so that™s one thing I remembe
r. Another thing is, when I got my 
[indecipherable]
 exercised a little bit when I threw 
a rock at the bus that carried my 
father back fro
m work or Œ 
Kau nas
. 
Q: Did you get in trouble? 
A: Yeah, he saw it, an d 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: When you were Œ when you 
and your sister were born, 
did your mo ther then stay 
home and take care of you, or did 
she continue work as a teacher? 
A: Well, she did work as a teacher at 
the time when I rememb
er. I mean, I don™t 
think I remember anything before I 
was about five years old, or so . 
Q: Do you reme mb er the Soviets coming into  
Lithuania 
in 1940? Do you have any 
memories of that? 

A: I don™t Œ I don™t recall seeing them come into 
Lith uania
, but they were there, 
you know, and I Œ I don™t th
ink Œ I don™t recall seeing th
em actually, you know, any 
soldiers or officials or any Œ cause we liv
ed in the suburbs th
ere then. I don™t recall 
ever being in 
Ka un a s  
itself, you know. Yeah. 
Q: Let™s move then to 
Vilnius
. You say your father moved to 
Vilnius
 at what point? 
A: Well, it™s hard for me to sa
y because I Œ I™m not quite sure. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore

A: But I know th at it was s
lightly befo re the outbreak 
of the war, and Œ and you 
know Œ 
Q: Okay , so Œ 
A: Œ and Œ and the 
German occupation. 
Q: Oh, it was before then
. It was before then. 
A: Because one thing Œ yeah, one Œ one th
ing I do remember is
 the German army 
parading down  
Gediminas Prospect
 in 
Vilnius
, we were there already. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But I also remember, now that you™ve 
jo gg ed  my  memo ry , th
at I went to pre-
school or school, first grade in 
Vilnius
, and we had to  draw red stars and Œ an d you 
know, 
Stalin ™s 
picture and things like that. So that obviously was during the 
Russian occupation, yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So we were there already duri
ng that Œ the Russian occupation. 
Q: Okay. Do you rememb
er where you lived in 
Vilnius
, what it looked like? 
A: Yes, I Œ I Œ I do, because, c
ourse we lived there until 1944. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And it was in 
Tilto Gatv
¡
 numb er 12, wh ich is, know, a block or so, couple of 
blocks from the 
Cathedral
 
Square
, the center.

Q: It™s the center of the city. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay . And what kind of a place was 
that? Was it an apartment, was it a house? 
A: It was an apartment, and it was one of those things typical of 
Vilnius
. This was 
not in the old town, it was in the Œ what
™s called the new town , which is probably 
200 years old anyway . And it has a courty
ard, and it looked 
like an apartment 
building from the outside, and you walk 
in through a little gate, and there™s a 
courty ard. And so, our apartm
ent, we walked through the 
courtyard, up some stairs, 
and Œ but our windows were out to the street. 

Q: Ah, to  
Gediminas 
or to 
Tilto
 Street? 
A: 
Tilto
 Street, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh, so that
™s a small street. 
A: Yeah, it™s Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And it had a lot of great little houses, mo
st of which are gone 
now, but they were 
still there w h en we were there. 
Q: You Œ you say th at you 
remember seeing the German 
soldiers marching into 
Vilnius
, right? 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
10
A: Well, I don™t think it was marching, I gu
ess there were just Œ there was a parade, 
I guess, aft-after they do Œ marched in. 
But I don™t remember them marching in. I 
do rememb er when th e war began, I was walking down  
Tilto Gatv
¡
, and co ming 
home from somewhere with my
 mo ther, and we heard like a mu ffled explosion 
somewhere. And I guess that was a Germ
an bomb being dropped somewhere. But 
there weren™t too many of them, they didn
™t, you know, mash up the city too well. 
But then the Polish woman, re
me mb er running by yelling, 
paniczka
(ph), 
paniczka
(ph), 
wo jna
, which, you know Œ 
Q: And what does that mean? 
A: That means, 
paniczka
(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it™s war, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so th at Œ that™s what it sounded, 
but I don™t rememb er Œ there were no acts 
of war in the city itself. 
The Germans just, you know, moved in an d that the extent 
of it. 
Q: Do you have any memo ri
es of how the atmo sphere 
in your home changed? Did 
your parents look nerv
ous, did they  seem Œ 
A: Well, I mean, everybody was nervous 
thro ughout this whole period. And I do 
remember that there was a lot of social ac
tivity, that they wo
uld go togeth er, you 
know, and have parties, and 
you know, talk and why my  Œ 
my father never used to

smoke, well then he started smoking with 
his friends, because they were Œ they 
were always nervous and not certain 
of wh at Œ wh at was going to  happen. 
Q: And his job in 
Vilnius
 had been Œ can you tell us 
a little bit about that?  
A: Well, he was Œ like I said that Œ at Œ at 
Œ at first he was ins-inspector of schools, 
where he would go insp ect and file repor
ts on various schools that he was Œ 
somebody who I guess oversaw the hiring a
nd promotion of teacher
s. And then at a 
va Œ at the la Œ last position he had, he wa
s a director or deputy director for special 
and vocational education. 
Q: I guess the reason why I come back to 
this is that during the first Soviet 
occupation, teachers were particularly targeted for deportation by the Soviets. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And so I™m surprised that th
ey weren™t on this Œ that th
ey weren™t targeted in this 
way, that he continued having some so
rt of job in  the educational sphere. 
A: Yeah, I Œ and in fact, he Œ he to
ok advantag e of Œ of, I guess the Soviet 
occupation to move into  
Vilnius
 because before that it was Polish, and th ere was no 
such possibility. But I guess a lot of 
opportunities for pe
ople to work in 
Vilnius
 
became available just before or during the 
Soviet occupa Œ firs
t Soviet occupation. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
12
Q: Well, I realize that the period of time 
that we™re talking abou
t with you, really 
will start from 1941 til 1944
. And at that time you were
 between six and 10 years 
old? 
A: Right, right. Well, nine to Œ 
Q: Okay . Nine, 10 years old. So  how Œ 
do you reme mb er ho-how life changed? I 

mean, you saw Œ you had an  im
age of Œ of German soldiers
 marching in a parade in 
town , you have an image and a memo ry of
 a Polish lady ran Œ ru nning and Œ and 
saying Œ 
A: Yeah, the war is Œ 

Q: Œ the war is here. W h at were some 
of the other images, some of the other 
fragments of memo ries that you 
have from the very first days? 
A: Well, the first Œ it™s hard
 to say because na Œ we lived
 in this little 
street, away 
from Œ only about a block 
away from a main street. 

Q: Right. 
A: But as far as a Œ a four or five year ol
d, six year old child is concerned, it mi ght 
be la Œ two miles away, because you™d ne
ver get out th ere anyway . So, I didn™t see 
very much of Œ I do rememb
er, before the Germans came
 of Œ I was walking again 
with the Œ well, we Œ either
 my  mo ther or my  ma Œ her mo ther, my grandmother 
would take me for walks, you know, in 
Vilnius
, and before the Russians left, I saw 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
13
some Œ right around 
Ca thedra l Squa re
, there Œ there Œ there were a few trucks 
passed with Œ loaded with people and with
 Russian soldiers with bayonets standing 
in the corners of the truck. And I later 
found out those were the people who were 
being deported to 
Siberia,
 being taken to th e railway station. 
Q: Did you ever walk Œ remember walkin
g around in the real old town, which 
would have been the Jewish quarter of 
Vilnius
? 
A: Yes, we Œ we do that all the time. 
My grandmother would take me to the old 
church es, she was a devout Catholic and 
she would go Œ I reme
mber there was Œ I 
think it was the Dominican church, there was 
a stairway that the 
supplicants walked 
up undern eath. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And they had little relics of saints™ blo
od or something like that and that they 
kissed it and so on. And I rememb ered that 
Œ her doing that, and in fact I Œ I was 
able to see that at one of our visits, you 
know, l-lately, about,
 you know, five, six 
years ago. They™re rebuildin
g the whole thing and I actu
ally got to see the same 
staircase, only now it looked  a 
lot smaller than it did before. 

Q: Did you notice Œ I mean, since many of 
the churches were interspersed with 
where the synagogue was, wh
ere the narrow streets in 
the old town were, where 
there were Jewish peddlers in places. 
Did you notice these th
ings? Did you notice 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
14
any part of the Jewish life that was going 
around? You were a child, of course, but 
was that something that Œ 
A: No, I Œ I don™t specifically recall, you k
now, seeing the Œ the Œ the Jewish life or 
the peddlers or the Œ the stores. I Œ  I Œ I 
guess we didn™t go into th at section very 
much. We went, I guess, near the 
Cathedral Square
 and the wa Œ or the 
Sa int 
Anne™s
 church and the Dominican c
hurch was in these areas. 
Q: Did you know of anything, even at that
 young age, that there are people who are 
Jews? Did your parents talk about anythi
ng like that at home? Do you rememb er? 
A: Well, I don™t recall we were specifically
 talking about that, unt
il later, when the 
Holocaust started and I reme
mber once my father saying
 to the Germans, we™re 
offering, you know, for thos
e who collaborate, you know, with them, offering th e 
chance to be the first o n es in
to the apartments of the Je
ws that they Œ that they 
deport to the ghetto. 
Q: So he mentioned 
that at home, huh? 
A: Yes, and apparently some people were 
taking it, you know, cause otherwise they 
wouldn™t be talking about that. But my fath
er was as Œ as poor 
as a church  mouse, 
but he never do Œ did 
anything like that. 
Q: What a Œ did you ever see any 
Jews when you were a child in 
Vilnius
? 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
15
A: I mu st have, but I Œ I just don™t have a 
recollection of wha Œ of wh at they looked 
like, except for one in cident wh ich does stick in my  mind. 
Q: Tell us about that incident. 
A: Yeah. And th is was something that has 
really etched in my
 memory, because I 
do Œ I don™t reme mb er very mu
ch from that time period, but
 this one of our walks in 
the city. And I guess we were walking somewhere. 
Q: Who were you with? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: Who were you with? 

A: With my mother. 
Q: Okay .  
A: And whether I™m Œ and we 
were walking down some st
reets in the old town , and 
at this time I guess the Jewish people were 
still not locked up in
 the ghetto, but they 
had to wear a yellow Star of 
David
 on Œ on th eir clothing. And at that Œ by th is time 
they could not Œ they were 
not allowed by the Germans 
to walk on the sidewalks, 
they had to walk in
 the street. And we were walki
ng along and I saw this German 
soldier run up to this elderly lady with a 
gi Œ with a yellow star on her clothing, and 
strike her with the Œ with his rifle butt.
 And it turns out like wi Œ he was doing it 
because she was walking on the sidewalk. 
And I rememb er very clearly I Œ I Œ I Œ 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
16
it™s not something that you see all the time,
 and my  mo ther getting very upset. She 
started to yell at that soldier, you know, 
how can you be doing th
is to an old lady, 
and crying. And so that™s something th at I Œ 
a-an act, or a Œ a Œ a real act of violence 
against a Jewish person, and by Œ appare
ntly  it was some  kind of a guard that 
walking around the streets, taking care o
f, insuring that nobo
dy was walking on the 
sidewalk when they™re not
 supposed to, you know? 
Q: Did he turn on your 
mo ther, did he pay attention to  your mo th er? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What did he do? 

A: Well, I Œ I just stay with her, I asked 
here what™s going on, and this Œ she said 
that these people are like beasts, you kn
ow, the Œ who would be doing th at, you 
know, to defenseless old people? 

Q: But did the guard  hear your mo ther 
and then turn  his attention to her? 
A: No, he didn™t, he just said something 
in German, probably 
something that™s like 
stay out of it or something, but I didn
™t understand it, you know. Bu t he didn™t do 
anything to my mother. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did yo
u walk on afterwards? 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013 
 

 
 
17
Q: Yes. And did your Œ did any explan a
tion or further co nv
ersation about this 
happen at home? 
A: Well, I Œ I Œ I suppose there was, but I 
don™t recall, you know, wh at happened at 
home. The Œ my  mo ther probably told my  fa
ther what was going on and they talked 
about it, but I don™t have that Œ that recollection. 
Q: Yeah. What Œ did your neig hborhood
 change after the German occupation on 
Tilto 
Street? 
A: Well, we don™t Œ we didn™t Œ our nei
ghborhood, you know, the people who lived 
in that Œ in the apartments
 facing that courty ard probably were the same people. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah. The only thing that I learned later, th Œ much 
later, while my mother was 
still alive here in the 
United States,
 is that the building 
in  the middle of the 
courty ard Œ it was a couple of Œ series of
 small buildings with
in th e courty ard, 
which were quite old and I think th ey™re 
designated as historical monuments now. 
Anyway , she told me that during the Holo
caust, during the shooting of Jews in 
Paneriai
, those houses were used to Œ to store Œ 
to Œ to Œ I guess to
 Œ to house some 
of the shooters. And Œ and she said that 
you know, every mo rning th ey would take 

them out there you know, with trucks. And th
en in the Œ in  the even ing th ey would 
Œ they would bring them back, and they 
all would, you know, stumble and fall out 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore  
 
February 18, 2013

of the truck completely dru
nk, with bottles of vodka in 
their Œ in their hands, and 
apparently  that Œ  
Q: And the neighbors Œ 
A: Œ that™s Œ that™s who they were, they 
Œ they  Œ apparently th-these were people 
that, I think they we
re called the Œ the 
Ypatingas Bu rys
, a special, you know, troop 
who did the shooting. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And where they got was people, and th
ey  were all young hooligans, hoods Œ 
Q: Were they German? 
A: No, they Œ they were Polish and Lithua
nian and they were local Œ they were 
local people from 
Vilnius
 who obviously were doing it to be able to get their hands 
on all the vodka that they want. And they 
would start drinking in
 the mo rning and Œ 
and Œ and not Œ and not finish
 until they were passed out at night, I™m guess that™s Œ 
that™s how th ey did it, you know. 
Q: Did your mother Œ did 
you have conversations Œ no
w this takes place in the 
United States
 when you™re already older and so
 on. Did you have more extensive 
conversations with her about th
ese things, about these topics? 
A: Well she Œ she didn™t like to talk abou
t that very much, but of course she was 
very mu ch  aware of wh at was going on ther
e and Œ but I don™t know if she really 

 
Interview with Arvydas Kliore

19
knew exactly what was going 
on there because this was not
 something like a public 
record, but of course ev
erybody knew what was ha
ppening to th e Jews of 
Vilnius
. 
Q: But I mean later, after the war, when 
you said that when
 you were in the 
United 
States
, she mentions this Œ this incident, that 
these are the soldiers
 and they were in 
the courty ard, and so  on. At that time,
 was there mo re conversation? You were 

already in the west, you were already Œ you
 know, it was safe and Œ and so on. Was 
there more conversati
on about such  things? 
A: Well she Œ she was always very Œ a humane person. And it™s obvious that it was 
difficult for her to talk abou
t something as Œ as hag Œghastly as that, you know, 
where Œ where you know, mass killing was Œ 
was carried out. And she Œ she was, of 
course were very condemning of the Œ 
of the g-guys who were Œ the drunks who 
were shooting th ere, you know. Bu t other th
an that, oh there was Œ a-and Œ course 
th-the Œ the whole drift was that we don™t 
have anything to  do with  them, these are 
just extremely, you know, ba
d people, they  were the Œ sh
ould stay away from them, 
you know. 

Q: As the war progresses, you get older, you know Œ 

A: Uh-huh 
Q: Œ you Œ your grow Œ and 
so by 1944 you are how old? 
A: ™44, I was nine years old.

Q: Okay . 
A: This was in December Œ in December we Œ we left 
Vilnius
 and th en
 Lithuania 
in December of ™44, when th
e front was advancing toward 
Vilnius
. 
Q: Mm-hm. What were the rest of 
the war years like? Was there any other 
interaction with Germans that you reme
mb er? Did you ever pass the ghetto by whe 
Œ after it was established? 

A: I don™t rememb er that. We mi ght have, 
but I don™t think anybody wanted  to go 
near the ghetto because it was 
full of German guards, a nd things were closed off 
with gates, and people just didn™t want 
to get in Œ near that whole thing. I do 
remember that I think it must have been
 about 1943 or so, 
when the Germans, I 
guess in response to the failure of the L
ithuanian Œ Lith uanians to establish a Œ a
 SS
 
regiment or something like that, began send
ing, you know, selected people to the 
concen tration camps. People who had na
tionalistic, you know, inclinations and 
things like that. And a number of people fro
m th e min is try  wh ere 
my father worked 
were shipped off to 
Stutthof
, and you know, some of them died there. And so  I 
remember that for Œ for weeks, my father
 and Œ and his other colleagues, you know, 
switched locations where they slept every ni
ght, so that they co
uld not be easily 
found if Œ if Œ cause usually 
when they come to
 arrest you they come Œ they don™t 
go to your place of work, they 
Œ they come to Œ when y
ou™re sleeping in your Œ in

your apartment or your house, wh ateve
r. So they Œ th ey were Œ well, you know, 
scared of getting shipped off to 
Stutthof
 and so they Œ they did th is. And so that 
was, I think it was in this se-several, in
 the last months of Œ of the German 
occupation with. Cause this was going on 
already and they were trying to avoid 
that. 
Q: Are there Œ are there any other memories
, fragments of memories from that time, 
about the war, about the occupation, about
 perhaps conversations that were had 
about these things, that Œ that you 
can recall, when you were still in 
Vilnius
? 
A: Well, I don™t think that our
 parents, and of course nobo
dy else talked to children 
about what they knew
 what was Œ that was going on. No w of course, they all knew 
what was going on, but they were not shari
ng this with us. Of course, I think that 
my  mo ther was always, you know, aghast 
that this was going on, you know. And 
my  father, you know, our Œ 
this was a time when there 
were epidemics now going 
through. There was a typh Œ typhus epid
emic which my sister and I spent a few 
weeks, you know, trying to  Œ to get to Œ 
Deet
. And I remember that, you know, 

before Œ before the, I guess ghetto, and Œ an
d the destruction of the Jews, our family 
doctors were Jewish. Dr. 
Gehrler
(ph) and doctor Œ I du Œ don™t rememb er the 
name. And I think th at Œ and then  toward  
the end, I guess, they weren™t Œ they 
weren™t there any mo re, so that was, you know.

Q: Did you have any memo ries of who th 
Œ of these individual
s? Do you remember 
th Œ how they looked? 
A: I faintly remember how Dr. 
Geh rler
(ph) looked, because he would come and 
take care of us. But I don™t Œ don™t know a
nything else about him or what happened 

to him. He obviously wound up at some Œ in 
Paneriai 
or whatever concen tration 
camp, you know. 

Q: Oh. When did your own inte
rest in Œ in these events th
at people were so silent 
about, when did it start to appear? 

A: It was, I think, always there, because 
I knew, of course by reading the inter Œ the 
na Œ the international press and Œ and so
me books about the Holocaust, and Œ and 
the Œ the Œ th e destruction of th
e Jewish population of eastern 
Euro pe
. And of 
course you would Œ 
could not see very mu ch  of this, or
 any of this in the Lithuanian 
press here in the 
United States
, because that was like a 
taboo topic, you know. 
Q: Why? Why do you think it was? 
A: Well, I think many reasons. I think on
e reason was that the Lithuanians who 
controlled the press were themselv es asha
med of what was going on. They  did not 
want to mention it or to Œ to
 Œ to Œ to even , you know, 
mention it in the Œ in their 
papers. Maybe it would go away , you know, 
that kind of thing. Now of course, 
there were some who were openly anti-Se
mitic, who said that this was all, you

know, some nonsense that the Jews are Œ ar
e spreading, you know. But that Œ that, I 
think, was the minority, most of them just
 didn™t want to, you know, hear about it. 
Q: But why would th ey ha
ve a feeling of shame? 
A: Because they knew
 that there was some Œ obviously
 they knew that there was 
some involvement by Œ by Lithuanian
 people, not just the Germans. 
Q: I see. 
A: Because when you look at Œ at Œ I-I st
arted  researching this thing on my own a 
long time ago. As soon as I got my  degree
 and started working and se Œ then started 
reading books. And wh en the computers came 
out, I w Œ I went to the web pages of 
the various organizations that deal with 
the history of the Holo caust, and you know, 
find out what was going on. And after Œ and Œ 
Lithuania
 became independent again 
in ™91, there was Œ there were publications 
by the Œ the history, a kind of, I guess 
history department or history 
institute, of various maps have to do with the history 
of 
Lithuania
. And one of them was a map of wh
ere the executions of Jews took 
place in 1941. And I was amazed to
 see that the whole map of 
Lithuania
 was 
covered with these places, which also men
tioned a number that were executed in 
each place. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And Œ

Q: It™s a small country. 
A: Yes. And so it dawn ed on me then that 
this not something th
at could have been 
done by, you know, couple of hundred of Ge
rmans. I mean, they 
had to Œ so mebody 
had to round up the Jews in each one of 
these localities, drive th em Œ march them to 
the gravesid e, and th en  whoever shot 
them, shot them, but the Œ the shooters 

themselves did not do th is, obviously. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So that suggested to me that were a 
lot more people from the police forces of 
that Œ of the provincial police forces, who 
were involved. And obviously th is is the 
case, an-and I™ve been trying to  find out w
ho they were. And in fact, I™m reading a 
book now by Œ just came out rece ntly
, I forgot the name, where a woman 
PhD
, 
Sutton
, I think was it Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: 
Sutto n
, yeah. And when she sh
ows a picture of the 
SS 
officers with the police 
chiefs of the Lithuanian provi
nces sitting, a nice picture. And of course I Œ I Œ I Œ it 
doesn ™t take mu ch Œ I don™t have to be 
Einstein
 to figure out what they were talking 
about there, you know. 
Q: Yeah. Why is this important to you?

A: Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in 
Lithuania
. What happened in 
Lithua nia
 
is important to me. And I want to know 
the truth. I mean, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s kind of 
hard to take to Œ to talk about the peopl
e who Œ who are, you know, accomp lices in 
something of this sort. But if
 that happened, I want to kn
ow about it. I want to know 
who these people were. Where th Œ where th
e Œ are th-they now. Most of them are 
dead, but, you know. 

Q: Do you think that that cu
riosity, that need to know 
Œ it™s more than curiosity, do 
you think th at™s shared by many people 
in the Lithuanian co
mmunity, whether it™s 
here in the 
United States
, or there? 
A: Not too many. I think a lo
t of them take the attitude 
that oh, this happened, you 
know, 60 years ago, forget 
about it, you know, it™s gone, let™s just go on with  life. 
They don™t care what happened. 

Q: Would you Œ why sh Œ do 
you Œ I mean, this is a le
ading question, but, why 
should they care? 
A: Well, any human being should be concer
ned about a Œ a Œ some Œ something that 
happened in which millions of innocent people were killed. And so I don™t think 
anybody can just 
shake their head and Œ 
and forget about it. Un
fortunately, th-things 
like that haven™t stopped happening 
since then, your Œ you look at 
Srebrenica
, and 
look at 
Rwanda 
and places like that. I mean, geno
cide, that goes on even now. And

I think people have to be aware of this 
an-and try to stop it, be at Œ learn from 
mistakes that were ma de, or Œ or they we
ren™t mistakes, it™s just a misplacemen t of 
Œ of priorities Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ where the National Socialist Order si
mplistic solutions to
 Œ to complicated 
problems. Okay , you don™t like the Jews, 
the Jews you think are doing something 
against your, you know, countr ymen. So, of course, you kill 
them all, that™s the best 
way to get to redress the problem. And th
is is exactly what they were doing in 
Bosnia
 and Œ and in 
Rwa nda
 and places like that, and that should be something that 
people wo uld no longer think ab out. 

Q: Thank you. Thank you ve
ry mu ch fo r sharing both your memo ries, and your 
thoughts, and your inte
rest. I appreciate it. 
A: Well, I™m still continuing these interest
s. I™ll be contacting 
you, trying to  find 
some mo re material about this. 

Q: Okay , we™ll be happy to help . Th
ank you very much. This conclu Œ
