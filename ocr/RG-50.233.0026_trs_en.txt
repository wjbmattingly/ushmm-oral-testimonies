March 29, 1992 
Malden, Massachusetts 
 

 

A: Like you know, I was born in Poland. We nt to school in Poland.   

 

Q: Can we start before -- tell me  your na
me  and your  date of birth on the tape?   
 

A: Yeah, all right.  My name is Sevek Fi shma n.  Born in Poland, 14
th
 of July 1918.  Okay, I went to 
school in Poland. 
 

Q: What type of --?   Did you go to a Jewish school? 

 

A: Yeah. You see, over there, in Poland, the Je
ws were a separate nation.  Jews were Jews.  
Naturally we were going in a school what was Jews
, Poles and -- like here. The same  thing like 
here.  Naturally I had to learn a trade. You know
 why, I think my father was a very wise ma n.  
He used to say, ma lucha is ma leecha.What this is in English, if you have a trade, you ha ve a 

kingdom. You know, he was a businessman but he said anything can be taken away from you.  

But what you learn and you have -- how to say in
 unet, an education, nobody can take it away 
from you.  He was very wise. Thank my trade, 
the truth is I survived.  So now I can tell you, 
you know, the way I growed up.  I growed up, I l
earned my trade and my father, my mother 
they had a business. Wa s a factory and my olde
st sister was in the business.You know, it was 
not a small business. As a fact, when the Germans come  in, they come  into Poland, in 1939, in 
the fall.  In 1940, right away, they put it up la
ws like everybody knows. They confiscated 
everything what it up laws like everybody knows.  
They confiscated everything what the Jews 
have. 
 

Q: You lived in -- you grew up inWa rsaw?   

 

A: No.  I was living in a suburban from
Wa rsaw.  I born in Kaluszyn, Poland. 
 

Q: Okay, that™s suburb ofWa rsaw? 

 

A: Yeah.  It is a -- Kaluszyn is about 45 kilome te
rs fromWarsaw.  But in the meanti me, before the 
war, we mo ved in another city, B_______. That
™s -- took us about 15 mi nutes to go into 
Wa rsaw. That™s nearer. The Germans, when they come  in, in 1939, this wa s the fall.  In the fall, 

they took about seven, eight days, the 
war was over.  Poland didn™t fight.  
 

Q: Can we back up though?   Before we get into the 
war --.  I™m sure we™re get involved in talking 
about that.  Can you tell us anyt
hing  else about your home?   
What was it like in your home?   
What did you? 
 

A: My home was a Jewish home .  I remember
, you know, I don™t know if you know, it was a habit. 
On Saturday, Jewish people didn™t travel.  
If a Jewish ma n, a fter sundown on Friday, passed 
through, not to break the Sabbath, he used to 
go in, in the synagogue and every Jew what was 

able had to take home a couple orchan. This me an
 guests, what they take home  for Sabbath and 
they sheltered him and they fed him.  Saturday 
ni ght when the stars come out, it was already no 
more Sabbath, he was ready to continue his -- ho
w to say in English -- his  -- to go where he 
wants to go, travel. He can begin 
to travel.  So like I told you 
before, we had a business and we 
were ma king a living. Ta lking about my fa mily
, a lot of time I asking myself, how come I 
survived.  I was already that time, not Hasidi
c, was a freethi nker. I already like today, the 
younger people, begin to think their 
own way. In this my father and mother was very charitable 
people.  Because I know when you live in a smal
ler city, in the suburban, then the neighbors, 
some  neighbors, not all of them, certain people in
 the community, they didn™t  have no fish, they 
didn™t have no meat, they didn™t have no challah. 
To us, the mother used to call up and it was 
delivered and it was not like here, papers.  B
ecause that™s what I learne d.  If you give 
some thing, don™t brag about it.  Is
 a fact, if I donate money, I 
don™t want it to even -- people 
should know what I do.This come s from the househol
d.   Okay, in the forty already, my father 
opened up a shop for me .  I was already, 
I had my  education in tailoring --. 
 
Q: How did you do that?  We re you apprenticed to some body?  

 

A: Apprenticed, absolutely, oh, sure. 

 

Q: After high school? 

 

A: After the school, after the school 
you had to go and learn a trade. 
 In a trade, take you several 
years. You know, in the beginning they give 
me  two dollars a week. 
 I said two zloty you 
couldn™t buy too much for it.  But look, if you want 
to learn, you got to learn.  My father used to 
say, look anybody can be a businessman but if y ou have a trade, you have a kingdom.  I want 

you to learn. Why he wa s thinking this way; be
cause my father ™s brother inWa rsaw had a big 
business from the stores where they used to sell 
clothing.  He used to have cutters, designers.  

He was very good off and he wanted me  in case I 
need it, I should have 
some thing to fall back 
on it.  My father said, in Europe, you know a guy 
what used to sell shoelaces or used to sell 
some  cigarettes, he was a businessman. Anybody ca
nnot do this without education.  So he want 

me  to learn a trade.  I learned my trade pretty
 good. When the Germans come d in, I already had 
my shop and I had two people working with me already.  I already was teaching some body else, 

younger kids. This was going on, this was the style in Poland. 
 

Q: Did you -- was it like a Jewi
sh neighborhood, your shop?  We re your patrons mostly Jews or 
not, or both? 
 

A: We  had Jewish people, Polish people, you know. 
Yeah, everybody.  It was not that time, a 
ghetto.  No, we were living together in a smaller 
place. We were living neighborly.  It was not a 
--. The truth is we didn™t in the city of
 B _______, it was not a big 
population from Jewish 
people, the opposite.  Ka luszyn was the populati
on from 90% Jews.  Sabbath, you couldn™t get 
even a glass of water.  It™s th
e truth -- Sabbath -- when they we
re calling to go to the synagogue 
-- it was a style. You know what I mean, they were calling when it was around three o™clock, 

they used to call _________. You know they used 
to call to go to the synagogue. The stores 
were closed and everybody was 
preparing to go to the synago
gue.  Over there in B _______, it 
was already a little more advan
ced, a little difference, you know what I mean. The people when 
there was sundown, everybody was dressed and they we
nt to the synagogue. A differ ent style, 
was already more to the south. This was in sout
hernWa rsaw, south, and Kaluszyn is to the east, 

on the other side ofWa rsaw. You haveWa rsaw
, Prager and then you have Minsk, Mhzowiecki, 

you have Kaluszyn, you haveWe grow, you have S
_____, you have more to the Russian side, to 
the east. And so it was a difference, a different city, a different setup between the Christian 
population and the Jewish population. We  didn™t ha
ve this kind of --like it was in some  other 
places.  But naturally, the German influence,
 the propaganda after ________ passed away. You 
know what I mean, the anti-Semitism propaganda began to influence, you know, the Polish 

people.  It™s a fact when the Germans come d 
in, in 1939, like I told you 
in the fall, the war 
didn™t last too long.  It last 
ma ybe eight, ten days. The Pole
s didn™t want to fight. The 
Germans, what I know about it, the Jewish people,
 the Jewish boys what they was in the Polish 
army, they would do the fighting.  Because we
 expected from the propaganda, when the 
Germans wi ll come  in, what is going to be. It™s
 a fact that the Germ
ans already took Poland, it 
was divided Poland by the book, between Russia a
nd Germa ny. The Germans comed in, the 
Germans took away the quarters of our house, from
 our house. A big offic e r happened to take 
up from our house, half a house. Wh en he come d in, he was like a hyena, like an anima l .  But 

you know, a Jewish woman, a Sabbath, she cooked fish and meat and mached a yulk an aroma.  

The German officer was over there and you know, litt
le by little he became  domesticated.  My 
mother used to bring him some thing to eat. Afte
r several weeks, four weeks, or six weeks, he 
used to come  in, he used to say Frau Fish
ma n, v _____ didn™t you go to Russia?   Because Hitler 
what he said, he™s going to do it, he™ll kill ev
erybody.  He stood in the 
light and he said, I™m 
sorry, such a nice people, they should be waste
d.  But in the meantime, you know wha t  I mean, 
he realized, he said some thing 
what he shouldn™t say it.  So he
 said, please don™t repeat what I 
said because he looks like he was afraid for hims elf, you know. Anyway, you know, after 

several months, you know what I me an, the Germans 
begin to tighten up the city like they used 
to take --. The first thing they took away ev
erything what the Jews ha
ve. The radios, if you 
have a motorcycle, or you have some thing, they
 took it away. You couldn™t  have nothing, they 
cut it off eve r ything. We  had a housemaid.  
The housemaid, her name  was Marta.  She 
happened to ma rry a guy by the name , Bernard from 
Zh ____.  He was a very educated guy.  He 
was a director of a Swedish f
actory what ma kes ma tches. You know, strikels are ma tches.  
When the Germans comed in, he put it down  
a bi g eichenkrist a red belt with a black 
eichenkr ist and he became a big ma n in the German thing.  Over there, we  have the German 

neighbors,Volkdeutschen. Volkdeutschen, a lotenlisted themselves to the Germans. The 

Germans naturally give the order they shall take
 the Jews for work.  Naturally, they took me  
too.  I knew them and they knew me .  Lazora™s 
son, they has  son from the west. You know, a 
young ma n like me , I know the guy what they grabbed 
me  for work.  I used to say then, Poland 

was a Poland and you didn™t act this way.  He sa
id to me, keep shout and kicked me in my 
behind, otherwise, you™ll get shot. I 
realized that this is the truth. 
I have to do what I have to do.  
When I™ll come  to talk about this Bernard --. You know, he happened to ma rry the Marta, he 

didn™t hurt nobody.  He didn™t hurt nobody.  Is a f
act, every time when I -- when they pushed us 
out from the  city --when it come  the time  wh
en every Jew have to 
get out from B______, go 
into theWa rsaw ghetto, he was the guy when he 
used to drive through with a truck, he used to 
drop me  off azach.You know, it was a big -- with bread.  He used to go through the ghetto.  

Opened up the door, he used to say, stay in this 
corner and I™ll throw you out a sack of bread for 
my fa mily. While when we was in B ______, he had a bag radio. We  used to hear the BBC 

from the underground.  Between me  and you I think he was working for some  gover n me nt.  Not 

for the Germans, it is the truth.  Otherwise, we 
used to close the door and we used to sit and 
hear from BBC received from England. Why di d 
he have the honor to have the thing?   His 
brother was a captain in a U-boat.  But he wa
s speaking a perfect French, a perfect English, a 
perfect German, a perfect Russian. Till today, I 
have only a suspicion that he was working for a 
foreign governme nt, I don™t know.  Or for Englan
d, or forAmerica.  He did good.  He saved 
ma ybe three times from my death.  Oh, yes.  Because when you™re young. We had the kids.  

Not far from B______ was a factory from sugar.  
We  need sugar. I took the bicycle, it was not 
too much, a few kilome t e rs, I run down and ge
t sugar over there. Took off the armband and 
went down over there.  In the meantime, it wa
s, what do you call this, a roundup. Why was the 
roundup?  The Poles killed a couple Germans and th
ey took the helmets, excuse me, they shit in 
the helmets. They put it in thei r chests, the he
lmets. You know what I me an?  While they was 
there, they ma king a roundup, I was over there t
oo, in the middle.  In the meantime, they 
grabbed me  and I was laying on the ground. I™ll ne
ver forget a German come  through.  He had 
three squares on his shoulder.  I was laying on 
the ground and a German was staying with a gun 
over me .  He said to me , he said to the guy, th
e kerl is a strong kerl
, why you keeping him like 
this?   He asked me  what are you 
doing here?  I said Bernard sent me  to get some  sugar. Who™s 
Bernard?   I said he has this num
ber, here is his card.  He said to me  ________, get lost.  Believe 
me , on the bicycle I was flying.  I was not pedalin
g, I was flying.  I come  back to him and he 
said to me , why you didn™t tell me .  In other words, you know, check us. Why you didn™t tell 
me  you™re going over there. You™re
 doing things, one of these days
, I™m not going to be able to 
help you.  It was several times what he saved me . 
That™s  the reason I can say about him. That 
is the chapter. All right so we was inWa rsaw now. 
 

Q: Can I stop you for a second?  TheWa rsaw ghetto wasn™t , didn™t  --. 

 

A: 1940. 

 

Q: Yeah.  So between ‚3 -   --? 

 

A: Wa s still an open ghetto. 

 

Q: Right.  Between ™39 and ™40 th
en, what happened, how was, wh
at were things like for you and 
your fa mily? 
 

A: We ll, what it was, it was still --. The ghetto
 was still open.  In 1940, the ghetto was still open.  
So you could trade with the Poles.  If you have 
something to give them, they will sell you bread 
or they™ll sell you potatoe s or some thing. You 
know, it was still --.  But they were typing down.  
When they shift us in -- when they had a law,
 all the suburbans have 
to go into theWa rsaw 
ghetto. You see, all aroundWa rsaw
, all the suburban little 
cities, had to go in one place, in the 
ghetto. 
 

Q: You went with your whole fa mily? 

 

A: Yeah, still the whole family, y
eah.  In 1940, I got ma rried in the 
ghetto.  I was the oldest son and 
I knew my wife already for a couple years.  My fa
ther said he wants to bring the first child to 

the hippa, you know to the altar. Wh en I got 
married, it™s a tradition.Wh en I got married, he 
said to me , my son now you have to think abou
t how you™re going to survive.  So after the 
wedding, naturally I begin to -- I™m the oldest 
son -- my father was that time  ma ybe, ma ybe 42 
years old. The Germans already begin to put
 out laws, a law they needed young people to 
work.  Everything was covered, how to say, they 
didn™t know what they needed people.  If they 
give the order inWa rsaw, they need 500 people fo
r work, the Jewish geme inde, they had to give 
them 500 pe ople, a thousand people. You know how 
ma ny pe ople they want, there to bring it.  I 
was the oldest, I begin to smuggle in some  f
ood for the family. You know, don™t forget there 
was still six people, father and mother, everybody 
we had some  things what we were able to 
cash in, trade whatever you had.  People begin to
 do business in the ghetto
.  I™ll never forget 

there was a Jewish ma n by the name
 Rubinstein.  He used to stay
 in the corner and used to 
ma ke vixin. You know what vixin is -- joke s.  He 
used to say schmaltz. That means fats will be 
cheap.  People would ask him why.  ___________. Th
at mean the rich people melting out, they 
don™t have no more money.  Everybody™s going to be poor, you know.  In the morning, in the 

ghetto, life in the ghetto.  People us
ed to be laying in the streets, in the sidewalk.  Used to go 
around a horse and wagon and picking them up.  It
 was not even enough what to bury them.  
They used to wrap them up in gasha you know in papers. Wr ap them up and bury them.  I was 

going around, it was already so bad, --. 
 

Q: After how long, just a few months? 

 

A: Oh, no.  It was already more than six months, 
eight months. You know when the -- they already 
ma de, how to say, when you going in, you had toopen up a piece of wood lik
e in the military to 
open up, to go in.  I used to smuggle in some time with horse and wagon, you know, some  bread, 

potatoes.  He used to bribe the guard. The guard 
used to ask me  what you have there.  I used to 
leave the horse and wagon over there in the corner
 and approach the gate.  It was soldiers, my 
lieber, my lovely me n, would you please let me  in.  My father sick, my mo ther sick, the kids are 

sick, I have some  bread, I have some  potatoes. 
You never said how ma ny you have because if 

he™ll step on the wheel and look it in, you have more
 -- I used to say a bise
l, a little, never say 
how much.  Because he could say _________ why did 
you like to me ?  Always a little.  It was 
going on for weeks. You know I  used to br
ing it in -- one time it was a rainy night.  I 
approached the gate to drive in and I give them 
a golden watch to drive in with my loot, what I 
had. They stepped on the wheel, they looked in.  
He says to me , why did 
you lie to me?   I say, 
my lovely sir, I never lied to you.  I told you a little
 of this, a little of th
is, a little of this.  He 
turned around his butt from the gun.  He s macked me  over the head, opened up my ne ck. The 

blood was running, but you couldn™t run away. Th
en you give him a leverage to shoot you.  
You had to be near hi m till he gets si ck and ti
red from hitting you, then he said, get lost .  I 
turned around the horse and wagon, 
bloodied like a slaughtered animal
.  I went to another gate, 
I went over, I give them my briefcase.  He
 looked at me , I™m so bloodied, he opened up the 
gate, I give him the briefcase. You drove 
in, you unloaded what you had in the horse and 
wagon. Then you was asking yourself, why didn™t you go right away to this gate?   It™s  a 

question, how do you know which is good and which is
 no good?  You taking your chances.  In 
1942, I went out from the ghetto.  It
 was already so bad.  Old peopl
e were laying in the streets, 
you know, dying.  Climbing their hands and knees and 
begging a bissel water, a drop of water.  
Nobody could help them, nobody could help each ot
her.  Or you die or if you can, survive. 
 

Q: What was happening to your fa mily
 at this time ?  We re they --? 
 

A: At that time, they were still alive. 

 

Q: Were they all t
ogether, in one place? 
 

A: Yeah, they were living in one place.  In
 the sixth floor, inWa r s aw. You know, in ________ 
St reet. You know by mi ne father ™s  brother. They
 had a big -- they were moved in over there to 
them. They were living over there.  Is a fact fo
r a couple of months after this, when I went out 
fromWa rsaw, you know, I went to _____ where she was born, ___________.  Polaski.  I went 

over there. The first thing what I did with 
her, I dressed her like a shiksa, you know like a 
Christian, like a peasant.  She went out and sheboarded a bus. You know what a bus is, what 

they travel in. A regular bus and one schoolma te
 recognized her. You co
uldn™t get out from the 

ghetto.  But he didn™t say anything.  
He just went over, he just said
 to her Lonia. You know they 
were talking and she come  to the city where theyhad a factory, a cotton factory. You know they 
had over there inWe grow.  In a few days later, 
I had to leave. You know
 I had to follow her 
because my father ---. 
 

Q: How did you get out? 

 

A: Okay, the way I got out. When you™re going 
out fr omWa rsaw, you have to go through Praga, 
that™s two cities connected. You ha
ve to go through theVi stula, that
™s a river. When I  went out, 
the Polish youngsters used to say, __________, a Jew 
runs away from the ghetto. What I had, I 
had 50 zloty, what is 50 zloty, you couldn™t buy even
 a cigarette.  It was not money.  But I was 

walking. You know the streets was already bricked up with bricks, with 
glass on the top.  I saw 
like a dog, we had to duck under, under the bridge in the street, and climb through and you 

walk. You know, you wa lk, so we come  to the br
idge and they recognize me  as a Jew.  You 
know, I told them.  I offe red them the 50 zloty wh
at I had.  But they said, no they want gold.  
They thought every Jew had gold and diamonds.  
To tell the truth, I don™t know if I should say 
in the desk, I always carry around 
a knife, a big knife in my boot.  
I had to -- and in the bridge 
over there between Praga, one 
soldier with a machine gun was 
going one way and the other was 
going the other way. I went over to the German
 a nd I said, burglars, you know, thieves running 
after me .  So they took up the machine gun, they put
 it out a series of bulle
ts. There in the other 
side, they grabbed a tramway, a streetcar, an el
ectric streetcar, and they me t me  on t he other 
side.  I already went through the bridge. They sa
id to me  in Polish, give me  the 50 zloty.  I 
pulled out my knife, I said come  on, t a ke it.  It 
took me  a night and a day walking.  I come  to 

We grow. We grow was an open ghetto.  Now begins
 the real thing.We grow was an open ghetto.  
It was a city, a Jewish city where they used 
to _______ over there. You know what it is, they 
used to write theTorah. 
 

Q: A scribe, lots of scribes --? 

 

Aﬂ They used to ma keTorahs over there, writi
ng special. They used to ma ke telizen.You know 
what telizen is? 
 

Q: Prolacteries,yes. 

 

A: You know it.  It was a city. They had a small industry over there. 

 

Q: Made Jewish items? 

 

A: Yeah, that™s  right. There used to be a city 
like this.  The far mers there, they had a woolen 
factory what the farmers used to cut off the wool
, bring it to their fact
or y. The factory, the 
machine used to go and ma ke big rolls from the 
other side. You put in this way and come s out 
this way. They used to trade, they used to 
bring potatoes, they used to bring cabbage, anything 

you know to -- it was an open ghetto, just to live.
 At that time not thinking about mone y, 
thinking about how to survive.  
It was people, it was a city wher
e they used to ma ke pelts, fur 
coats, from ---. Naturally they used to bribe 
the German commandant. It was already the war 
with Russians. The Germans attacked the Russian
s and they needed the pelts. They used to 
give to the Germans, the pelts, the ghetto shou
ld be open.  Meantime, they begin to order the 
Jewish people should go to the camp .  Now it begi
ns we have to go to the camp.  I™ m a tailor.   
When I went out from the ghetto, you know wha t  I 
mean, what I need to take.  I take a couple 

coupons (? ) to ma ke a suit, you know that™s three 
yards, another three yards.  I have it over 
there.When I was in theWe grow I found myself 
a tailor machine.  I was assigned to another 
house with another couple to live over there. 
The geme inde, you know the Jewish hierarchy, I 
was a biesnick.  I used to come  over there, how 
to say a biesnick, runnin
g away from the other 
countries. 
 
Q: An illegal alien?   

 

A: That™s right.  I was over there. 
 In a way, I was how to say, with me  they wanted to plug every 
hole..  It was Jewish police, it was the quest
ion, whom shall they send away in a camp?  His 
brother, his sister?   I was how to say, a newcom
er to the city.  In every pl ace where it was a 
hole, they wa nted to plug up with me.  I was 
not an easy catch.  I tell 
you truth, was not an easy 
catch with me . When I  run through the street 
to get cigarettes, and the Jewish geme inde saw 
me , they run after me  because they ha d to fulf
ill the contingent what the Germans wanted for 
labor. All right, I was fighting them as mu
ch as I could. You know it was by the name ,______, 
hierarchy, you know, what they wanted for the Je
wish geme inde, they had to -- listen they want 

to save their fa mily.  I was a stranger so they
 send me  away in a camp.  St ar _______. They 
were ma king over there an airfield for the Germ
ans from the  woods.. They should taken off to 
attack the Russian front.  Over there, the labor wa
s very hard. They used to put up the railings.  
People used to carry sections of 
railings, connect them and put  it on 
a little --, like from the coal  
mi nes, little wagons. We  used to push the stone or  gravel, you know what I mean, to make.  

Every day they used to come  there, engineer 
or the hierarchy fr om the people.  It was an 

organizationTod.  It was over there. 
 

Q: You were involved in working for this --? 

 
A: Yeah, for them, for organizationTod. They used to come  there in ____. They used to line up.  
They used to count up and he looked at you.  If
 you don™t like it, they took you aside. Another 
one aside, five, six people aside, they t
ook out the muzzle, the gun, bingo, bingo, bingo. Then 
he went to have his breakfast.  In every pack
age of cigarettes, they 
had stamps v____ in every 
front.This was the propaganda. And if the front was no good, he took out the Jews, bingo, 
bingo. When the airplanes, when the airfie4ld 
was already done, come d already the -- you have 
to fill the airplanes with gas. He picked out th
e biggest me n, six-footers.  I was a little guy.  I 
give you a sample. Whe n we were carrying the ra
ils, a six-footer was in 
the front, a six-footer 
was in the back.  So the six-footer wa s too 
heavy to carry, so he was bending down with the 
shoulder. The smaller guy like me , I had to li
ft up my shoulder to hold it down. They were 
going with clubs, banging over the knees, he shall 
go straight or the othe
r, how to say, why 
you™re doing this way. Anyway, every day was seve
ral deaths.  For fun, they
 used to take out a 
strong guy, the same  hos e where they used to put in 
the gasoline, they used to put it in the hose.  
They used to say to the guy, let down the pants,
 put it in the hose and le
t go the gasoline. The 
guy used to lift up, used to light a ma tch and th
row hi m.  He used to burn like a, like a -- you 
take and some ti me s you see in the jungle there, 
with a stick, you know what they burn in a fire. 
 

Q: Oh yeah, a torch, yeah. 

 

A: A torch. This way they killed him.  Listen, 
it was no way to survive.  Over there I saw today™s 
he, next day™s the other.  My line 
is going to be sooner or later. 
 

Q: How long were you there? 

 
A: I was over there for a couple of weeks.  I run aw
ay.  I run away. Hey, it was over ---.  I wanted 
to be shot because when they™re shooting you, 
it™s over.  But this way, you keep[ always 
sweating, always sweating from frightening.  Might 
as well --. Anyway when I come back to 
the ghetto, I didn™t went into the ghetto.  I sende
d in a guy to tell to my wi fe, I™m over here.  

She already knew. You know why, because when she come  to the geme inde, to the hi erach 

from the Jews where they™re giving out a loaf of 
bread, they told them theWa rsaw bird already 
run away.After this, they send me  a way to M _______, another camp.  It was a small camp, just 

how to say to take it out the youth. That the c
ity shall be less Jews.  
Tr eblinka was not ready 
yet, not ready, how to say, to 
____, to destroy the people.  It was 
still building the crematoriums.  
They keep over there, it was over there a c
ouple hundred Jewi sh people, wome n, me n. Then 
when they liquidated, they come  
back to the city. When I come  back, I was always frightened 
from the police.  I was sitting, I give you a samp
le in the house and I was doing some  tailoring 
because the far mers, when I fixed them a pair of
 pants or I made them something, they used to 
bring me  a loaf of bread, a bag of potatoes, achicken.  Because  I didn™t need no money. The 

only thing what I need is just to survive.  
When the police saw me, I™m sitting in the window, 
they used to run.  In Europe, a cel
lar is not like inAmerica.  In Eu
rope a cellar is just like in the 
kitchen. A hole and its big board
s. It was a deck, like a door.  
For the winter used to store 
potatoes or some thing. What I did, in the bedroo
m, I used to rip it up a couple of bolts and 
ma ke over there another hole, lift it up, it was not 
a ma ttress like a shan __, lifted up this and let 
myself in. When they come  in the house, they
 said, I just saw hi m in the window, where is he?  
Where did they look, I disappeared.  So they we
re looking there and went away.  I had a couple 
hours work to do.  In the meanti me , when the farmer come , he brought me  the -- several 

potatoes or anything, I had some thing to eat. Whe n
 it was very bad, I had to hide some where in 
an attic.  My wife used to -- she had an a
unt over there, Mimi  Lia, she used to cook up 
something and bring me up the attic because th
ey were looking to send away people and I was 
hiding out.  It was so bad, it was already m__Y
om Kippur, the end ofYom Kippur.  Already 
they was taking people, sixty year
 old, was not youth, inWe gr ow. 
 
Q: Was this ™43? 

 

A: Yeah, ™43, it was already so ba
d.  It was already -- they didn™t ha
ve already whom to take it.  I 
was still there because I was fighting everybody. 
 I was fighting the commandant, I was fighting 
____, because I proved them at one time, I a mbushed them. You know what an ambush is?   

You know in Europe, it was a door when you closing the 
door with a big title, th
is is an iron bar.  
I took the iron bar and I grabbe
d the commandant.  I say, if 
you don™t lay off, you see one bing, 
your brains is going to be  in the wall.  Because 
I didn™t have nothing to lose.  I was already dead 

one way or the other.  Finally they said 
to me ,Wa shua,____-_______, we™ll do our job to you.  
They™ll do it to you. Wh en it was already bad, m___Yom Ki ppur, they surrounded around the 

city ofWe grow.  Looks to me  likeTreblinks wa
s ready, seven kilome ters fromTr eblinka.  I 

have a, what you call this, I was sick. You got 
sick, too, what is it. Typhus, typhus.  She got 
sick, the family, the family was still alive over 
there inWe grow, they took her home .  I was over 
there in the room where they give me to live 
there with another fa mily.  Naturally when you 
have typhus, you know the heat, the fever is very, 
very ______.  It was over there a girl and the 
boyfriend used to sit attending his girlfriend, he 
attended me .  Her boyfriend was not sick.  He 
used to put her down cold water on the head, he 
put cold water on mi ne head.  I always told 

him, Sche ma, when I survive, I™ll never forget 
you. When I got better, I reme mber, we -- they 
were living near the shield.  It
™s  down the hill. You know when I went down to see how she™s 
doing, the wi nd was carrying me . We ll, she got bette
r and naturally we went to the shul. The 

shul was already destroyed. The less Jews we
re gathering in a bar
n. They™re crying and 
begging to God, they™re praying.  If
 such a thing exists, the skies 
would split from the tears. We 
come  back, in the night.The Germans went ar
ound, you know what ludens are, shadows. With 
the bietnam,  _____ in the shadows, Juden roust,
 Juden roust, you know what I mean. In the 
morning, they had to ma rket all the Jews what wa
s survived already.  Old people, I was between 
the youngest because they couldn™t do nothing with me .They loaded them in horse and wagon 
and they shipped -- they drove them
 up toTr eblinka.  I was still there.  Me and my wife, we was 
hiding in this hole what I had 
beside the cellar under the bed. 
What I did, I opened up the door 
from the cellar and show to him, who will come  in, the door wa s open, how it was already 

clean, no Juden.  Because  that time already.The Je ws knew they ma de double walls, they 

climbed in, in the chimneys to hide; they hide in 
the attics.  It was outside the toilets. A lot let 
themselves in the shit up to the chest, just to br
eathe, just to breathe.  Ov
er there in a small city, 
they had cows, they had chicken.The cows we
re without food, without
 a thing, were ma king 
moo, you know. When I, in the morning had gotgray, I looked through the window.  I saw a cat 

passing by.  I said look, how lucky, they™re not goi
ng to shoot the cat but if I stick out my neck 
and somebody saw it, bingo, I get a bullet in my n
eck.  But it got a litt
le lighter, I went down 
back to the hole. The Germans come in, in the h
ouse.  I heard them. The y were shooting in the 

walls because a lot of Jews had double walls, they 
were hiding in the walls.  But a lot of Jews 
ma de mi stakes, they took it in the walls, a cl
ock. When you come  in, in the house you can hear 
a clock. They looking for the banger from the 
clock. A lot of Jews they found between the 
double walls. They took them out and they took th
em to the cemetery. They had to dig their 
own graves, they shot them.  I come  t o this, 
I™ll tell you how I know how they did it. After 
sitting in this hole, for ten days without food, w
ithout water, I™ll never forget, the walls in the 
grave were so shiny from my sweating, from frig
hten, it was like a mi rror. Finally it come  on 
me such a -- I got so scared -- I said to my wife, let™s get out fr om here.  Let™s go in the back.  

There is over there a single house, painters were
 living over there.  Le
t™s go up in the attic over 
there. You know what she told me .  My heart te
lls me  I™m going to stay here. You want to go, 
you go yourself.  I grabbed her by the collar.  I sa
id look, when I say go, you go.  Is a fact she 
wanted to go out from t he ghetto, fromV_____
_ but the ghetto was already surrounded around 
by the Polish police, the fire departme nt, 
________ gendarmerie, the Ukrainian, the Litvakian, 
all around.  She wanted to get out, she couldn™t get out, she had to come  
back in the same  hole 

what I was there.  She couldn™t get out.  Otherwis
e, she tried to get out as a Christian girl.  She 
had to come  back. 
 

Q: I need to flip this over now, it™s running out. 

 

AS: Okay, let™s ---. 

 

Q: Here we go, okay. 

 

A: All right. So when everything -- she got so sc
ared and I got scared, we 
went up in the attic over 
there where the painters were livi
ng. The first thing when I come  
up in the attic, I opened up a t 
__ a little door. You know what I me an, from the 
old side was in the pitch from the roof is a 
little door.  I say to take away the suspicion 
open up.  If it™s closed, they™ll put it up a ladder, 
they want to see if some body™s there.  I count upover there, it was the family from the painters.  

So what I did the first thing, I 
put them under the eave and took a
ll the rest and covered them.  
My wife the same  thing, I covered them.  I opened up the piece of rope from the desk, opened 

up.  I, myself, took a piece of iron. When they™l
l put up a ladder and they 
want to see who it is, 
hey, you smack them over the head, you™ll kill th
em, you get up and they™ll kill me. That is -- 

mi ne thing is over.  Lucky enough, they didn™t come
 up to this attic but they went in another 
house where the door was closed and they took down a whole fa mily. They were 
ma nufacturing leather, leather. They took down 
the whole family over there to the ceme tery to 
be slaughtered.  How I know what they did.  One 
girl come back from the  cemetery.  She come 
back to this -- upstairs where we were over th
ere.  She told us what was going on in the 
cemetery. The Germans let her go, she was so beau
tiful, she was really b
eautiful.  He looked at 
her, ma ybe he had a daughter her age and he said
 to her ________, get lost.   Oust but get lost.  
She come  to us.  She told us what was going 
on over there in the cemetery when they brought 
the people. They had to dig their grave, a tr
ench. They undressed them and they shot them 
with a machine gun. They fall down and the Pole
s were staying over ther
e and taking off the 
rest what is over there -- for sa
mple, the stockings or the underw
ear. They robbed them. That 
she told me  what was over there.  Otherwis
e I wouldn™t know what they doing over there.  
Okay, now it will come when th
ey took me  the last days, when they took me  up to _______.  
When they took already the remnants, what is le
ft over, you know when the fire departme nt and 
the other, this was the last when they put us in 
a gathering place, like a ja
il. Anything what they 
could, they shipped us off.  My wife brought me
 two loaves of bread, you know with a piece of 

rope. You know, this was the last. They shippe
d us off.  My plan was when thy put us up in 
trucks -- they put it up, the Germans with mach
ine guns.  My plan was when they™ll take a 
curve, the truck has to slow down, I™ll jump.  I 
couldn™t jump because if I would jump, he was 
on the truck, I would get a machine gun.  My pl
an was if I™ll come  dow
n to the camp, I™ll bury 
myself under the truck. When the truck will go out
, I™ll dr op myself.  It di dn™t work either. 
When they took us out from the truck, we we
nt inside, the truck went away.  Now comes 
preparation when we come d in. The  
first thing, you know what a baya is? 
 

Q: Abarrier? 

 
A: A baya. This is a wooden belt all around, going to
 be ma ybe about six foot in diameter. About 
15 inches high. You had to sit on the edge. They come  with a machine, cutting off your hair 
and the hair fall down to the baya
.  I tell you true, I was already 
sick and tired from running.  
This was already my last trip.  I 
said look, all right, wh
at is going to be, I™l
l be here.  I already 
give it up.  I couldn™t take it no more. When did I 
decide to run. When they cut me  off the hair.  
I had a head of hair and I looked mys e lf in 
a can. You know, the Germans when they had the 
rations, is the tin cans, you could see yourself. 
You know, like a mi rror.  I saw myself, I didn™t 
recognize myself.  I say no, I rather 
be killed, I™ll run.  In the meantime, in the morning, I had to 
stay in the line to get food. What wa s the f
ood in the morning?  The wheat, you know what the 

Œ half a skin, they call this krye
n. They take it off the skin and the rest is flour. You know what 
you™re able to bake. They mi xed it up with wate
r.  In it was stinking, it was soil. The people 
was already over there for months before I come
. They had diarrhea, the shoes were ripped, 
they didn™t have no shoes, they took off bark from
 the trees with a piece of wire, if not a piece 
of -- thing put it in the food. They ma naged to s
till work, they had diarrhea, they were working 
and shitting, working and shitting. When they 
gave me  the food, it was stinking, so I give it 
away. You had to take a can from the conserves, 
from the  army what they all was over there, 

the barracks. They said to me ,Wa shula, 
you going to be one ____ you™re going to lick it out 
with your tongue every drop.  I was thinking to 
myself, you™re going to be King Solomon if I™ll 
be here.  Because to me  my life already, I sacrif
iced.  I don™t want to live. What was the work?  
greenazia. You know what greenazia is?   It™s  
a swa mp. You ma king a big gutter, how the water 
shall run into this gutter. The 
people, the elflinger where they wo
rking had to rip it out the roots 
because it wa s swamp.  I t  was big piles of the root s to dry in the swamps. You had to go in, it 

was already ice, thin ice but they were stayi
ng with the bullwhips.  If you don™t go in, they will 

bullwhip you. You had to go in, in the swamp six 
footers, lowe r, lower, 
lower till the end..  Me, 
a greenhorn.  I come d over there, it
 was cold.  It was already thin ic
e like the glass.  I try to hide 
but the police was staying, I had to go in.  One happened to be a Jewish policeman, happened to 
be too. ____, a Jewish boy, a schoolma te of hers. 
 He said to me Wa shula, you go in.  I couldn™t 
go in, it was already ice. I tried to hide under the 
roots.  So he pulled the whip.  I grabbed the 
whip on the other side.  I pull it. Wh y I pull it,
 it was running with my ne ck, I open him up his 
face, he was bleeding.  I said 
look I™m going away from here, th
e Ukrainian will come, they™ll 
shoot you. This was the night when I decide d, I w
ill run. I come back to the barracks.  He was 

sleeping.  I was sleeping in the first _____ and 
anotherWe growak, Ulek was sleeping in the 
other. In the night, we had the 
toilets, we had outside.  Outside the barracks.  It was a, I don™t 
know what you call this, like this he
re.  It was like this.  In he
re was a stick, you had to climb up 
and shit into the hole. To the rest, it was not
, how you say enclosed.  It was everything open.  
Ulek says to me , give me ________™s scarf.  
You know what it is, shake my hand, you™re not 
going to leave me .  I said fine, we™re leaving tonight
. They give us our coats, our ripped coats.  
The pillow was stuffe d with grass and we decide
d tonight, we™ll leave the camp.  It was wired, 
barbed wire, but the wire was ma ybe about 12, 15 
inches apart. You know it was reflectors all 
around, in the woods.  So I the night, I went ove
r to the wires, you know, had reflector, goes 
around.  Meantime when the reflector goes one side 
and this side is dark, before the reflector 
come  to you, you laying in the ground. When it 
gets dark, you go up again and you come  to the 
wires. You taking the jacket and you throw over th
e barbed wi re, barbed wire points.  He grabs 
it and you pull him down, you knocking out the lights.
 When you™re knocking out the lights, 
the machine guns begin to fly. You can feel every bullets what goes by your head. You know 

what I mean, cuts the air, you know every bulle
ts what goes by near you. You dropping to the 
ground and you begin to climb.  It took me  several 
days. I didn™t went into the ghetto.  I sended 
in a Polish guy what I used to 
do tailoring for and tell him, I™m back.  See, she was still over 
there in the ghetto.  So after a day, we  escaped. 
We  escaped from there and we went out in a 
colony.  In a colony, I come  over there to a guy by the name , what was his name , Munich.  I 
was working for him over there. When I went
 out from the ghetto, I had to have a piece of 
bread or some thing, I used to go out from the 
ghetto, it was open ghetto, I used to go in the 
village walking over there in th
e colony. When I was working 
over there for a couple weeks, I 
ma de with him friendship. When there was al
ready no Jews, little Jews what they™re going 
around looking, who was still hiding, 
I went out over there and I took the girl what I told you 
come  back from the ce metery in a crossroads.  
She went one way. I went to this guy Munich. 
Why she we nt over there, her father like I told 
you, he had leather.  She knew a Polish guy what 
he had the leather and she went 
to this guy over there.  But a 
couple of weeks later, I found it 
out that she got shot by the Felt gendarme rie.  It
 used to be Fe lt, used to drive around in the 
fields looking for Jews and she 
got shot over there. I was over there with the guy Munich.  One 
night he called me  in, he said to me  I™m such 
a good friend of yours.  He used to deliver to the 
Germans soma gun.  He used to ma ke vodka for the Germ
ans.  He used to ma ke to deliver to the  
Germans, vodka.  He used to deliver from the 
Polish farmers, grain.  It was a noma how much 
every farmer has to give to the Germans for the 
army.  He says to me  I™m such a good friend of 
you.  If you would see what they™re doing to the 
Jewish people when they capture them, they 
putting on ropes. They™re putting on ropes, one 
leg are up and the other leg in the cars going 
apart. They™re ripping them apart.  He says 
look, you™re such a good friend, I couldn™t  be able 
to live with myself if 
I would see what they™re going to do 
to you.  I™ll go into
 the city if you 
want, I™ll bring you poison. This is going to be 
the end.  He already had -- mi ne what I had.  
Naturally when I come to him, what I had I gi
ve him away. I said, look, if I™m going to leave 
you, why don™t you give me  at least a piece of ma teri
al. Whe n I™ll go to a far mer, at least he™ll 

give me  a loaf of bread for it. You know wh
at I mean?   He says you™re not going to need 

nothing. You™ll go out from here. 
 It was a group of Poles used
 to go around and killing the 
Jews because  the Germans give them a reward for each Je w, give them a kilo of sugar. This is 
two and a half pounds of sugar ___ if
 you bring them alive or dead.  So he told me  I don™t need 
anything.  But luckily I survived.  I went -- I 
told him where will I go?  I took my wife under 
the arm.  It was already late fall
, very late fall.  I™ll never forget, it was already the sugar beets 
was already the last what you have 
to take it off. The leaves used to flop in my boots back and 
forth. I was going with my wife; everybody™s alrea
dy killed.  Her parents was already taken to 
the cemetery to be shot. The brother was shot, the mother had to take him out.  I found it out 

later, the mother was taking him by the legs, the 
father by the arms because the brot her was shot 
in the house and bringing him to the cemetery. 
They got shot over th
ere.  Her mother and 
father. With the _____ and with the younger dau
ghter, with the younger sister here.  I come  
over there to another guy, Genchel, another guy
.  It was already -- 
I went through -- I was 
working through the whole winter between the fa rmer
s.  Over there is a 
style under ma rriage.  
One far mer ™s daughter ma rried to the son, the son 
is ma rried to the other, are chained, a whole 

village is under related. What it was, I was 
working for the farmers, for the winter, ma king 
clothes. You see, my father was sma r t.  I 
was ma king clothes, ma king pants, jackets, heavy 
coats, you know what I mean.  I give you sample, of I had a job what took me  a week, I used to 

ma ke it three weeks.  I was interested in time .  
While I was there, I was safe.  Because if they 
would find me  over there, they would shoot the 
fa rmer with the fa mily and then they would 
shoot us.  I saw when I was over there I was safe.  Nothing do to me .  I was going from one to 

the other till the winter was over.  If the Jews 
what they was over there in the colony, they used 
to come  in, I used to talk in the farmer to give 
them a loaf of bread to give them a pail of water, 

I saw when they™ll stay away from he re. Th
e Germans should not find out that the Jews are 
running this colony.  Finally, a w
hole winter, it we nt through. We  
survived the winter. The end 
of April, ---. 
 
Q: Forty- three?   ™44? 
 

A: Yeah, for the winter, ™44.  End of the winter.  
The first day of May had to be the end ofApril is 
the first day May.  Before inApril, the Ge
rmans out it out big signs
, everybody who™s alive, 
who™s in the woods, who™s in the fields shall come
 back to the city -- no more killing.  A lot of 
people went. What they did, they broke all the ho
uses and they left one house. All the Jews 
that come  back.  It™s a fact, my wife said to 
me, let™s go back to the 
city, I want to see who 
survived.  It™s  a fact, you know wh
at I mean, a lot of Jews wha t  they were in the woods and the 
fields, went back.What they were doing there 
--they were breaking up the Jewish houses while 
they were still alive.  In the night, they all co
me d in one house.  I said to my wife, you said I 
have to go right now.  I say I don™t go right now.  I say, you know me , if I  go to the city, I™m 

dressed like a farmer. You know why, I give
d away my good boots, I gived away my good 
pants.  I give away everything, I put it down to 
everything ripped.  I stepped in cow ma nure.   I 
stink like a fa rmer.  I took a whip and I pretended to be a farmer.  If I  want to see what is going 

on in the ghetto, I went in like a Polish farm
er.  I was an outsider, nobody knew me .  I come  
fromWa rsaw.  Nobody knew me  and I could see what 
was going on and come  back.  I     said to 
my wife, you want me  t o go in the night over ther
e and see?   I say, in the day, I™ll go. You know 
the way I go. The same  night, 
they dynamited the house and th
ey killed all the Jews. The 
neighbor, the next neighbor, Genc
hel come s over toYa nek to this
, oh what I have the picture 
and he knocked on the door.  He said,Ya nek, di
d you hear what™s  happened last night? They 
leveled off a ll the Jews, no more Jews inWe grow. They all blowed them up.  Okay.  Now 

begins me .  Everybody in the colony knew I™m still there.Another guy by the name  Kaluski; he 

had a daughter in another village, N ______.  Ov
er there was another wife with a husband, a 

tailor .The Germans killed him over there.  He co me d back and he said he  saw with hi s own 
eyes that they killed theWa rsaw tailor.  Me and 
my wife, they killed us.  I said to my wife, now 
the book is closed.  Officially, we dead.  Nobody™
s going to look for us.  Because the guy, the 
Munich what he wrote from us, he wants us to 
poison, he was still working for the Germans.  
He was going around in every farmer, asking do you 
know where the tailors ar
e, where they are, 
if they™re still alive. Wh en it was a ru mor that th
e tailors were killed and Kaluski was a witness.  
He saw with his own eyes, I said 
to my wife, we  already dead.  I 
was with thisYa ne k, this is 
what I have the picture.  I digged a grave, I™ll 
never forget when we digged a grave over there 
from his cellar.  He had a boy what was eigh
t years old, Henek. We  was ripping the ground 
with the hands and the blood was running.You know from the  finger. We  ma de ourselves a 

grave over there. We  was over there 
for eighteen months till the war ended. 
 

Q: In the cellar? 

 

A: In the grave. 

 

Q: In the grave? 

 

A: In a grave! You know, we couldn™t dig too deep
 because the water would come  in. We  put it in 
straw in the dust, the walls we put
 it down straw. We  digged it in 
a corner in the house.  I had a 
knife.  Like I told you, I had a 
knife.  I cut it around the stone.  Because the house was staying 
in four big stones.  In case it is a fire, I™ll be ab
le to pull it in the stone, 
in the grave and I™ll be 
able to climb out.  I took a knife and cut it away 
in the boards that the light
 shall shine in, in the 

hole. When I was sleeping, she had to be up.  
When I was up, she was sleeping. Whe n we had 
a cough, we had to cough, we took a piece of --
a de ______, a heavy piece of cloth, wrapped it 
around the head and coughed in that nobody should listen.  Because you never know when a 
neighbor will come  in. 
 
Q: This is all day and all night? 

 

A: All day and all ni ght, twenty four- hours.  
We  couldn™t st and up because the grave wasn™t  so 
deep like this table. You had to only lay or s
it.  Once a week, she, Maria took out my wife and 

gived her a sponge bath in a baya, in a little ba
rrel. The me n were stay
ing outside and watching 
a neighbor shall not run in. When he was washi
ng me , she was staying outside, a neighbor shall 
not running in.  Now you wonder why I™m sending them mo ney.  They deserved. They earned 

everythi ng what I do. We  didn™t sign a contract.  
We just shake hands.  Until the day he died, I 
had him here in this country forsix months with me .  Oh yes, I 
had his son™s wife here for six 
months. Every month goes a check to this people
. Thank God, I can afford it.  Oh yes. You 
read in the papers. 
 

Q: They brought you everything ---? 

 

A: The first thing before they give me  the food, you know what I mean? They had to empty out the 
steple, a pot what we™re 
huma n being, we have to go in the 
toilet.  She had to bring it in, 
outside. Wh en we did get out, the soil you couldn™t
 have a sign that it™s fresh soil. After they 
put it in over there and the cow was staying and 
covered with ma nure.We  was over there for 18 
months laying. When I was liberated from the Ru
ssians, we couldn™t walk. We  had to begin to 
learn how to walk. Whe n the Russians  alread
y, when we climbed out from the hole, it was 
Jewish soldiers and they find out 
that we™re Jews. They took us in a field hospital. They were 

at that time  transporting the wounded in a 
horse and wagon.  I was 
holding down on one side, 
she was holding down on the other side from th
e wagon. The horse was carrying the wounded.  
We exercised to come over there. The first 
time in my life I saw already was in spring ______ 
 
Q: In™45?  

 

A: That™s  right, you know what I mean. The Russian
s were staying a whole winter, but inWa rsaw, 
you know when they blow it upWa rsaw, you what I m
ean, preparing for the last attack to go to 
Berlin. You know, I was already liberated. The 
Russians, the Jews told me we never know, 
we™re liable to go back. You never know what a fr
ont is.  Liable to go back. While when they 
brought through the front and they 
being to go through the other sideWa rsaw and they begin to 
go, the commandant from the village, Ruchna was 
already, how to say, a Jew and the Christian 
begin to ask me , how did you, where did you survive?
  I said, I survived 
in the partisans with 
the Russian army. You know, you had to cover th
e slot where -- how did you survive?    I was 
afraid to sa yYa nek, I was over there because they
™ll come and they™ll ki
ll him.  Because over 
there they didn™t want it to -- 
not one Jew shall be alive. The commandant begin to ask me , do 
you know which Polak was killing Jews?   I say, 
look I have one guy want to kill me  and my 
wife. They ma de a celebration of
 liberation from this part with
 the territory. They made a 
Sunday, a platform, they took me  and they sa
id bring me  this Munich. You know, to be 
represented, he was killing the Jews. This was a 
very bad task for me .  Of course I knew that 
the war is near over and if you kill some body, not  you, even this, a lot of Jews what will 

survive, they™ll pay for it.  So they saddled
 me  up a horse.  I had to go and bring this guy 
Munich.  I went down in the morning; I knocked 
on his window. When his wife saw to me , she 

says, tailor how did you survive?   I say never mi
nd how I survive. You give me  Munich.  If 
he™s  not going to go with me , I said, the comm
a ndant want him.  If you do not go with me , I 
have order to burn you down. Already the house is w
ith straw, the roof is with straw.  I had a 
peteshta, a Russian machine gun.  He had to go with 
me .  He killed several Jews.  Now with this 
court over there, they ma de ______ the burgoma ster from the desk. They said to me  that I 
should be the judge. 
 

Q: Oh,God. 

 

A: Wa it a mi nute.  It was good.  I didn™t know why 
I got the mi nd.  I looked at him.  I recognize 
the clothes what he was wearing and I knew what 
he did.  He  killed his schoolma te David Bass, 
a Jewish boy and he pulled out the boots from hi
m. When I looked at him, I said to Munich, 
take off the boots. They don™t belong to you. They belong to David Bass what you killed him.  

I stripped him naked and I told him go ho
me .  Everybody was clapping.  I knew, you know, a 
shame.  Someti mes it™s worse than that.  I know. You know, I was plenty shamed because I was 

a Jew. 
 

Q: Absolutely. 

 

A: He had to move out from the village.  Go in
 take n territory where the Poland took up a piece of 
land from the Germans.  Until today, twelve 
years later, I took my kids. Me, my son, my 
daughter, my son-in-law, I showed themAuschwitz
.  I showed themTr eblinka.  I show them 
where I was working.  I show it in
 the grave where I was buried what
 I have here in the movies.  
I ma de a video from it.  I took 10,000 feet of fi
l m.  Everything is alive and ________, they™ll be 

able to see.  Here today, when I come back 
to the village, I wa s loved by everybody.  I didn™t 
took nobody, I didn™t hurt nobody.  I prevented that
 nobody should be hurt.  
I have the proof in 

here.  In here you can see all the papers.  I did ever
ything for this couple what they give us life.  
He was rewarded from the St ate of Massachusetts.   He was rewarded from theAme r ican 
counsel inWa rsaw.  Every month, he gets a check 
till the lift.  He was w
ith me, for six months 
here living.  He come s here. If I come  show you the movies. 
 

Q: Oh,yeah? 

 

A: Oh, sure I have it.  I have it on video now. Th
e way he count and the way he laughed.  He count 
like a farmer, he laughed like a lord. That™s right, 
with a golden cross, with a ring on his finger.  
He™ll come  back You know, I loaded him up.  I™m a 
tailor.  I have plenty th
ings what is left over 
from people. They don™t want to take it off. 
 He had several pounds of luggage. What I brought 
him down to NewYork with the ship, it was absolu
tely --.  Li sten, I owe it to him.  I owe my 

life to him.  It is a shame, is
 it™s  not too ma ny peopl
e what they were helped and they forget 
about it. 
 

Q: Now that™s  true. Although I think the people 
who did -- who were hidden and things like that, a 
lot of them ---.  
 

A: I don™t forget bad things and I don™t forget good th
ings.  Let my son or my kids tell me  when I 
come  back, I went back, they opened up the doors. 
 Everything, tailor what you want is yours.  I 
got stuck over there in the mud with my car.  
You know when I went over there for two weeks, I 
got stuck. They come  wi th horses and they pull 
me  out in the mud. Ta ilor, what you want, you 
want sweet cream, you want butter. 
 I say, look darling what we™v
e thrown away inAmerica, it 
is the trut h.  I didn™t tell them
 no lie. What we™ve thrown out in garbage you people don™t have 
it for the holidays. 
 
Q:  Tha t ™s t r ue . 
 

A: Thank God I™m alive.  I can tell this story. 
 I have some thing to prove with you.  I ma de ten-
foot, I made a video. They still live in the sa
me  thing, they we re living a hundred years ago.  
Still horse and wagon. They still not have the m
achinery to cut.  Some  day if you come  back, 
I™ll put you up the video and you™ll be
 able to see the way the city 
looks now.  It™s  over there, 
still the pump where they used to bring some  peop
le to the cemetery to be killed. The German 
ordered the woma n to take off the shoes because
 another woman run after the woman and say, 
give me  the shoes.  She refused to give him the shoes.  She said, you™ll take the shoes when 

they kill me . The Ger man ordered her, give herthe shoes.  She slapped 
the German in his face 
and he shot her near the pump.  Sh
e says now you can have the shoes. 
 

Q: Do you remember --?   Ca n I change the subject to before? 

 

A: Sure, oh, yeah. 

 

Q: I told you I want to ask 
you more about your Kaluszyn? 
 

A: Yeah,aboutKaluszyn. 

 

Q: That you could describe a li
ttle bit what it looks like? 
 

A: Kaluszyn was a city the same  thing likeWe grow
. They were over there, factories were ma king 

leather, ma king pelts, shoema kers, small industr
y.  Shawls for praying. There were small 
carvers what they carve them 
from wood, making brushes.The e
ducation, it was a small garden 
_____. People left at the meal. You know, they 
used to have -- I don™t know if you know what 
is a chulen, you know. After Saturday, you know me , you c o me  back from shul.You have your 

meal, you take your wife, you get your kids, you go fora walk.  It was a real,, like in Israel now.  

A real Jewish life. 
 

Q; Like a small town, a Jewish small town? 

 

A: That™s  right-- a Jewish life 
, a decent life. You couldn™t see 
chicanery or crookedness.  I wish 
before I die thatAmerica shall have at least 20
% a life the wa y it was over there.  I™ll never see 
it again.  I™ll never see it agai
n.   But I tell you I can be proud 
of my fa mily, the way I brought 
them up.  I have three kids here. They ma rrie
d, two daughters, they™re married to doctors.  My 
son is a doctor himself.  He is a vice-president 
in the Deacon™s Hospital.  I, myself, don™t have a 
big education.  I™m just a plain tailor 
and I™m proud of it.  I have to thank. 
 

Q: Absolutely, I wanted to ask you -- I forgot! 

 

A: Ta ke your time. 

 

Q: Oh, it was more about the town. We re th
ere Zionist activities 
or things like that? 
 

A: Ye s, yes.  I belonged in the Shomrah ________. 

 

Q: Oh, you did? 

 
A: Ye s, that™s  right.  Listen the Jewish people 
was always -- the Jewish people was a very small 
mi nority. We  had communists, we had socia
lists, we have L ____, we have R _____, we have 
Shomah ______. We  us ed to ma ke jokes of each other. We  have five Jews, with ten 
organizations. We  used to have fun about this
.  But when it come  to some thing, we always 

were united, we all Jews. 
 

Q: So even though you belong, for ex
ample, to _______, you observe Shabbos? 
 

A: Listen, you couldn™t bring a shame to your fa m
ily. When I went outside -- outside I was a 
huma n being like everybody.  But when I went fr
om the house, I took my hat and I left it near 

the door.  Outside, I didn™t  wear no hat but when 
I come  in the house, my father had to say, I 
wear mi ne hat. This was tradition. You don™t go ag
ainst tradition. You know. That™s  what is in 

shame, sha me is worse than death. That™s  right. 
 If mi ne kids, if I could take you down and see 
the way mi ne kids living, anybody would be prou
d. They giving away mo re charity what I 
ma ke a wee k. Thank God, they can afford it.  If 
I can tell you when I come  here to this country, 
I had bleeding ulcers and I was dead.  I was alre
ady between the death, pu
lled it out in a cool 
room.  But when I was begin to think, in order 
then when my son was born.  I begin to think, I 
had no _____, you know what ____ is, I had no ceme tery, a place where to bury me . That™s  

right.  I say my kid will grow 
up, he™s not going to reme mber he had a father. They were 
healing me in ulcers and what I 
had, a ruptured appendix. There, 
it™s a mi racle I survived. The 
doctors themselves were surprised I survived.Wh
en I was laying there already in the cold house 
and I begin to think my life the way I survived. They ask me whom shall I call because it was 

already the last hours, to call my 
wife , I said no.  I don™t want her 
to see the way I die. Then I 

said I want to go to the bath, the nurse told me  
that it™s already the orders from the doctor, I 
cannot go no place.  I said, look, my mi nd is s
till working.  If you don™t let me  go down to the 
bath, I™m not going to ma ke him better, I™ll go down by myself.  So she give me  a bedpan.  

When I moved my bowe ls, they saw this is 
a broken appendix, they brought me  back in 
between the sick, they piped me  up like a plumber. Two pipes in my nose , pipes in my arm.  

What you call this, intravenous.  From the other 
side, the blood.They put me  down under a big 
lamp and they brought me  up the next day in the 
morning. They told me to count to ten and I 
went out, I didn™t know. When they brought me  
up the next day and I looked through my hand, 
I could see the bones, I was yellow. A few days
 later, they used on me  the first invented 
aureomycin. When they ma de a show for the new students the way I survived, every doctor go 

by me , shake my hands and they said, you surviv
ed from Hi tler, now you survived again. I™m 
here to tell the story. 
 

Q: Well, I™m very glad that you are.  I want to
 thank you. Is there anythi
ng else you™d like to add 
about your story or we could ta
lk to your wife.  Perhaps you can add mo re about your fa mily 
me mbers if you want? 
 

A: Listen, my family me mb ers, I tell the truth.  
It™s not too ma ny people what they come , compete.  
I don™t know how to express myself.  I don™t know
 to say -- because it was Jewishness or they 
were human. They understood people need to be
 helped.They didn™t stopped for anything, they 
shall not help.  It is th
e truth and I learned it.  I saw it in my
 house.  In my  wife™s house, was the 
same way.  People -- you know wha t  a balbatash 
place is, that™s what it was.  I could be proud 
of it.  I couldn™t be --.  My kids, I have three ch
ildren, they learn from the house. If I could take 
you down to one of my kids, or 
to all of them, you would go out
 and they could take example 
the way Jewish people live. 
 
Q: That™s gr eat, glad to hear that. 
 

A: It is true, it is true .Listen, it™s not about brag
gi ng.  I™m telling the way it is.  Mine son-in-law, he 
brought up the kids and they getting a dollar,
 twenty-five cents goes away for charity. 
 

Q: Ve rynice. 

 

A: That™s  the way it is,  He wa
s brought up this way.  He come s from a very wealthy family in 
Massachusetts. They™re well known. The Dewe y St
orm fa mily, the first ship, they give away 
to Israel as a gift. The Boston University ha
s built a whole wi ng from his  money. Ve ry big 
charitable pe ople. They _____. They built thei
r money, thank God, they had enough money to 
give away. But I have to tell you a story. 
 Me as a newcomer. You know, you go into the 
synagogue in this city of Malden, you have -- 
how to explain -- myself, the high aristocracy.  
You know a Jewish wife™s  doctor ™s or some thing.  
They were sitting in sh
ul and talking between 
themselves. They used to talk thems e lves
, do you know the greenhorn™s daughter whom she 
got ma rried to?   It come  to me  she got ma rried 
to Dewey St orm™s fa mily.  It didn™t -- like we 
were born in a stone, it didn™t come  to us.  Let 
me tell you some thing.  I™m very proud of it.  I 
don™t have to be ashame d even of myself. 
 

Q: Certainly not.  Did you 
want to say some thing? 

 

A: [Fe male voice:  ﬁI have nothing to
 say.  He said everyt
hing.ﬂ]That™s  right.  I already said for her 
too.  See I can say the wa y they killed her father, 
the way they killed her mother. The way they 

killed her family. The Germans comed in and they
 were hiding in the house near the factory.  
They first killed the brother. The mo ther had to 
take the son by the legs, the father had to take 
the other half of the brother and 
to take him over there to the cem
etery. Then they killed the 
family over there the rest , in the cemetery.  Now 
I went to look for the ceme tery inWe grow.   
It™s no cemetery, it was plowed through, no cem
e t ery.  From the _____, the tombstones, they 
ma de sidewalks.  Over there is no more Jewish ceme tery, it™s too bad. 
 

Q: It™sterribl e. 

 

A: They tried to kill mi ne -- they founded out afte
r a while -- because I se nd them mone y. They 
used to wait for the postman. They come  the 
postman with the Jewish money fromAmerica. I 
had to send.  I had to write away some letters to 
the priest.  I had to writ
e away letters that he 
shall ha ve a speech to the congregation in the city
. That this Polish guy, washes off t he dirt and 
the blood from the Polish people what it™s still 
dripping from their fingers, what the ground is 
still wet from the Jewish blood.  How he is wa
shing off the sins from the Polish people over 
there.  If I went to Senator Kennedy and I told him the story, he told me  if you want, I™ll bring 

him over in 48 hours if they™re not going to stopbothering him.  He sent a telegram to the 

American consulate. TheAmerican consulate sent
 it over a guy to the city over there from the 
city ofWe grow and he talked to the clergy.  
If some thing happened to 
this ma n, you people will 
be responsible. They stopped bot
hering him.  It is the truth. 
 

Q: I™m going to turn this off now.
