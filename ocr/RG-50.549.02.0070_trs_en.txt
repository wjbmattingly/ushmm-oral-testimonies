Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Boleslaw Br
odecki, conducted by Nina Ellis, on July 26
th
, 
2003, in Richmond, Vi
rginia. This interview is part 
of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum™s post-Holo
caust interview project, a
nd it™s a follow up to an 
interview -- videotaped interview conducted
 with Boleslaw Brod
ecki in 1989. The 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby 
Herr for making this intervie
w possible. This is tape number one, side A. I -- I saw 
your video interview recently, and it ende
d with you and Sonia coming to the United 
States, you mentioned it briefly, 
but I would like to go back a little b it in time, and talk 
a little more about the time you spent at Landsberg. 
Answer: Mm-hm. 
Q: And I™m wondering if you might be willin
g to start there, and tell me if you 
remember when you came to La
ndsberg ro ughly, if you reme mb er the month, and tell 
me how you -- what you were like, what your
 -- what sh -- kind of shape you were in 
when you got there. 

A: Well, we got there, I think the war ende
d in May and there we 
spent some ti mes in 
Czechoslo vakia, because you were in the te 
-- terezin -- Theresie
nstadt, and we were 
getting ready to be like -- there was like a re
settlement place to go -- some people went

to their respective countries, and some peopl
e refused to go back to
 their own country, 
bad memo ries, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And we were not treated very nicely wh
en  we came back to Poland. People would 
say, you still alive? A lot of goods were conf
iscated, and they thought we were gonna 
try to get it back, so that wa
s not very popular thing to go 
back, especially to Poland, 
you know, and that welcome. So
 they start asking people -- 
they tried to send out the 
people from that area, like so
me people were from Russia, 
they going back here and 
there. And I decided to actually go to Ru
ssia, cause I didn™t know -- I didn™t know 
about America, if we can go 
here. So I knew Russians at th
e time, so I said I was from 
Minsk, cause I didn™t want to
 go back to Poland. So  they
 had a truck picking us up, 
and taking us somewhere, to a train stati
on. And I forgot something, a sweater or 
something, I went back in 
the building. When I come, the truck was gone. So I was 
stranded in Czechoslo vakia. And 
then they deci -- 
start talking about going to  Israel, so 
they were giving us like false papers, be
cause the English Inte
lligence was checking so 
people don™t go to -- which wasn™t
 Israel th en, it was Palestine. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: They didn™t want the people go that wa
y, you remember Exodus and all. So they 
were giving us, like telling us th
at we Italians or Greek, so
 we can go that direction, 
toward th e sea, you know?  

Q: Whose they? Who was facilitating this? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
4
A: Well, the Jewish organizations, 
you know, I -- I couldn™t recall that. 
Q: Oh. 
A: But we -- we s -- so we were in a train goi ng to Italy like, just 
to get closer to the 
sea, to go to Israel. And we supposed to 
be -- and I think, Italians and Greeks, or 
something like that, because th
ey don™t want to know we ex
ist, because that would be 
obvious that we go to  Palestine. So wh at ha
ppened, we r -- we ran out of food, so we 
talked to a American rabbi, which was in a uni
form, if he can help us. He say, you™re 
supposed  to be Greeks or Italians -- I 
don™t know how it came about, all of a sudden 
we got surrounded by a bunch of
 military vehicles, English, 
and they turned the train 
around, an d we went back to Germany, wh ic
h we w -- that -- at the time, I think we 
were in Austria. And end up in lan -- La
ndsberg [indecipherable]. And there was ex-
military camp where they t -- 
converted to a resettlemen t 
camp. W -- when we got 
there, things were very primitive. Ther
e were nothing -- we met the American 
commander, who was over that camp  at the 
time, Mr. mi -- Meyerhoffer. I met him 
here in a reunion, and I even got a book he 
wrote, that was a book with letters he wrote 
to his wife. And he says there was not to
ilet paper, there was nothing in there he 
ordered from -- from American supplies to 
send us toilet paper. You know, they  put a 
lot of people in there, and there was no fac
ilities, no nothing. So we
 started off a police 
department, and a employment, like bureau to
 get people jobs, and sanitary, and -- and 
like -- and a cafeteria so people 
eat there. Everything was s -- 
Q: Were there a lot of people
 there when you got there? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
5
A: Yeah, was a lot of people. No w, I couldn™t tell you the numbers, I don™t have no 
idea about numbers at the time, h o w many people. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: Today everything is statistics,
 but that was camp  in Landsberg. 
Q: Yeah, well I know that at -- at one point th
at they had at least 
5 0 00 people there.  
A: That™s possible. 

Q: Yeah, I don™t -- do you think it 
was that many when  you got there? 
A: I -- I couldn™t really tell you, 
I had no reco llection in that area. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was a lot of people, and of course, a-
at times they fenced 
us around because there 
was a lot of disgusted ex -prisoners going 
around in  the German city, robbing, and 
stuff, you know, peoplewere on the loose. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So th ey even put G.I.s
, you know, watching the camp,
 and one day we had the 
uprising over there. 

Q: Over what? 
A: Because s -- we were contained and -- an
d -- and they wouldn™t let us out, so we 
just di -- di -- a whole bunch of people got to
gether like a big march, and tried to break 
out. 

Q: Yeah, they didn™t want to be imprisoned again, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
6
A: Yeah, so there™s a lot of going on at th
e time. But anyway, we stayed there, and I 
don™t -- I cannot tell you, that™s wh ere I met her. 
Q: Well tell me about y
our job, you got a job. 
A: Well, I went to the employment office 
trying to  get a job, and th e guy who was 
running the employment office was nominated
 -- he was a Jewish fellow, and a police 
chief, they got the same name. So instead of
 work ing in an employ
ment office, I work 
in a police station. And you couldn™t tell it™
s police, because at the time there were no 
unifo rms, everybody was -- she™
s got a -- you know. So  I said no, I don™t want to be a 
policeman, you know, I™ve got bad taste 
of police -- policemen from the war, you 

know, and -- you know. 
Q: Sure. 

A: They were usually work in
g for the other side. But he 
said, ﬁThat™s not that kind 
police force,ﬂ he said, ﬁWe just watch wareh
ouses. But,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou get a suit, and 
you can eat in the cafeteria 
now.ﬂ So I said, ﬁAll right.ﬂ 
So an yway, I stayed about 
four years in the police department, and th
at™s where I met her, because she was 16, 
and her and a girlfriend went to a dance. An
d they supposed to be
en kinda cute, s-so 
one of the mu sicians followed them home, a
nd broke in  in their rooms, and they s-
scream, and people call the police. So I wa
s one of the rescuers, me  and another 

policeman. So next day I come to 
see how th ey  are doing, see? And -- 
Q: Did you take that guy aw ay? 

A: Oh yeah, we arrest him. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
7
Q: Put him in jail? 
A: He pull -- he pulled a knife on -- he got a stiletto on the table. 
Q: He was threatening her? 
A: I -- I don™t know wh at he was trying to  do, but they  were screaming, and th ey called 

the police, and next day I ca
me to see how they  were doing, you know, and th -that™s 
where is started. 

Q: So you stayed th
ere for quite awhile? 
A: About four years. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And then  we went to Munich , and we star
t registerin g. Then I have no desire go to 
Poland, she went to Poland, came back, be
fo re she met me. She says -- she probably 
told you about it, it was terrible. 

Q: Yeah, she did. 
A: So th ere was different offices you can register, go to the Un ited States, Australia, 

Canada, I don™t know, different
 places. So I put -- put my name different places, you 
know. We had to get out of Germany. So  we
 got a letter, which we were accepted, in 
the Richmond -- [indecipherable] in the Un ited 
States. So I don™t know if should put 

that on th e tape, but I ask -- when the Amer
ican soldiers -- we were driving around 
with the military police, I said
, ﬁDid you heard of Richmond,
 Virginia?ﬂ He says, ﬁOh, 
you™re not going th ere.ﬂ And I said [indeciph
erable] you know, so 
-- I -- that™s just 
what -- I don™t know wh at™s going on, you 
know. When -- when I got -- we got the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
8
letter, we went to Munich, and of course 
there were arrangements to fly to United 
States. But when I came to 
Richmo nd, I was unaware of the segregation. You know, 
when  I was little, we -- we had th e book 
about Uncle Tom, you know -- you know --  
Q: Uncle Tom™s cabin? 
A: Yeah, cabin. I wasn™t aware that there 
was a segregation, I 
would keep getting in 
trouble. I went to a black -- black barbershop,
 and then when I met 
the barber on the -- 
on th e bus, I sat with him, and the guy sa
id, ﬁYou better get up 
because they™re gonna 
stop the bus, because black people should sit 
in the back.ﬂ And you know, so I kept 
getting in  trouble, because we -- after the war we didn™t like discrimi nation at all, so 
that™s wha -- 
Q: Let me go back and ask you a coup
le mo re questions about Landsberg. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: What kind of things did 
you do in your job as a polic
eman? I mean, you went and -- 
and inner -- stopped this disturbance, but wh at
 other kinds of things did it turn out to 

be? 

A: Well, most of the time we were -- we 
were watching warehouses. Then a lot of 
times they were giving out food and supplies, 
so we had to stay there, keep order, you 
know?  

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: That was -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
9
Q: Di -- did you notice the conditions getti
ng better at the camp, over time? You said 
they were pretty bad wh en you first got there. 
A: Well yeah, yeah, yeah, th
ey were getting better, because it was getting a little more 
organized. And we also had a lot of trouble 
with black market. I guess a lot of people 
were -- you see, you couldn™t use banks, so
 all the smugglers, you know, they  -- they 
had people carrying money, and 
they were s -- well, we had 
a lot of trouble with that. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And -- and that was not official, because 
we couldn™t go to the official places and 
prosecute th em or something. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know? And there was a lot of smuggle,
 with the cooperation of the American 
army . They were getting money together, 
getting the -- what do they call it, care 
packag es. And wh at happened, those care p
ackages were bought by groups of people, 
and when they came back to
 Germany, there was a crew
 unpacking everything and 
selling it on the black market. 

Q: Before it got to the people. 
A: Oh yeah, because it wasn™t
 really meant for the people
, they were -- they were 
meant for s -- they were using as a cover up
 fo r smuggling. Becaus
e sum -- th ey didn™t 
have no license to sell cigarette
s. And -- and they said, like 
Belgian or something, that 
was legal to sell American cigarettes when they -- wh -- where th
e trailer came with 
cigarettes, the destination was somewhere el
se, we stop there, a
nd there unload, you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
10
know, there was -- there was a 
lot of that stuff. And United States, I mean, you hear 
about a lot of offices we
re involved in that. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. What other kinds of things
 were -- you™ve mentioned cigarettes, but 
what other kind of things were ava
ilable or desirable on the black market? 
A: Chocolate, clothing. Most 
anything can be transported. 
Q: And -- and was there a place where yo
u could go that you 
knew you c
ould buy 
something, was there -- 
A: Yeah, in like private homes. Some wome
n had a restaurant in their house, they 
were cooking, and go th ere and buy a meal
. There was nothing official, you know?  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But people -- be
cause people were there for --  
A: Then the ORT come in, th
e head of the OR T organization. They were trying to 
teach people trades, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. And they had schools, too? 
A: Yeah, they had courses for people to, y
ou know, to learn, although how much you 
can learn in a short time, but it was a beginning. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me what you remember 
about your wedding. It was, I understand, 
probably  one of the first weddings. 

A: Yeah, we had the whole place show up. 
You know, like in America they ca -- call it 
covered dish party. 
Everybody brought something. And 
we even have a band. There™s 
a lot of people call themself
 mu sicians but they™re not, and th ey -- and we have a band 
t -- that you could die laughing when they we
re playing, they were making false notes, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
11
and -- and everything. And there was a lot of 
people wini -- I never seen in my life. 
There™s two floors with people.  
Q: But it mu st have been a very happ
y occasion for everybody to experience a 
wedding -- 

A: Yeah, uh-huh. 
Q: -- even though they
 didn™t know you. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: Just to know that life goes on. 

A: I know it. 
Q: Yeah. Same thing when your son was born.
 I™m sure that was vicarious thrill for a 
lot of people. 
A: Yeah, we got in trouble, I was out of to
wn, and s -- and a neighbor of ours, she say 
that she got the pain, and a cer
tain, you know, how you call it -- 
Q: Labor pains. 

A: Uh-huh. And she went to hospital and they
 said they didn™t have babies born this 
particular hospital, there was another place 
which called San Cotilion, where they were 
taking women over there. She wh en she went 
to the hospital, they
 told her to come 
back tomorrow, some lik e that. So she went back crying
, she said, we have a neighbor, 
Dolly, or something, and sh e was a hostile pe
rson, she came back, she says, she gotta 
be here. And matter of fact, they called the po
lice, because was some  kind of a dispute, 
she wouldn™t leave, she cry, and said the 
policemen were my friends.[indecipherable] 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
12
So then when -- at -- at that
 time they didn™t give them 
anesthesia, anyt
hing, so they 
tell them to  pull, or something.
 So when she -- I was told th
at wh en she got in bed, the 
docto r, who was standing [indecipherable] wh
en  he bend over, see how she doing, sh e 
gave him a slap in the face. 
But it was a dum -- it was a l -- a l -- litfak -- I mean, a -- a 
-- a Jewish fellow from Lithow, so she gave hi
m a slap in the face.
 But anyway, that™s 
the way it went, and when I came 
back, she -- he was born th e 12
th
 of Decemb er, and 
I™m superstitious, and I finally
 got to the hospital, it was like 30 minutes -- 11:30 or 
something, and I said to the 
nurse, ﬁI want to see the 
baby.ﬂ She said, ﬁTake your 
time.ﬂ And I said, ﬁIt™s getting close to midnight, it gonna be the 13
th
,ﬂ so I called the 
nurse and say you go -- she say, ﬁWhat are you 
crazy, sir?ﬂ I say I want to see the baby 
now, you know, about five minutes to midni
ght, and I made it. Yeah, there was a lot 
going on in those days. 
Q: Yeah. That mu st have been a happy tim
e for you, after everything you™d been 
through. 
A: I guess so. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But I tell you, when we were liberated
, when we li-liberated in Theresienstadt, 
nobody was happy, because you were kind
 of [indecipherable] and say why me, how 
about my family, you know, th
ere was no joy. Took a little time to get over the whole 
ordeal. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
13
Q: Mm-hm. But by the time you got married
, and by th e time your son was born, were 
you able to feel that joy? 
A: Oh yeah, I guess so. I -- I -- you know, 
after all these years, today people analyze 
feelings, and everyth -- in those days we di
dn™t think ab out all those things, you know? 
Q: Yeah, yeah, that™s true. I™ve heard a lo
t of people say that. So you came -- you -- 
tell me how it was that you got to come to
 Richmond. Was it through a c -- a certain 
organization that br
ought you here?  
Q: Ah, H-Hebrew Ladies Bene
volent, which is now Jewish Family Services were -- 
we were accepted in this community, of course, oh it was fake, there was no job, or no 

-- no place to stay. After we got here, they
 started accommodating us. But they -- you 
need somebody to guarantee 
they will -- you won™t fall on 
nobody™s mercy, that you 
will have a place to stay, and -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- and place to work, you know, so when
 we came here, [indecipherable] not 19
th
 
Street, and that was -- 

Q: Do you reme mb er arriving at the airport? 
A: Ah, where? In New York ? 
Q: Is that where you came in? 

A: Well, we came in New York, and I -- oh, 
there was go -- some going on over there, 
screaming, I don™t know. Were the Union Station over there wa -- they call it. A nd -- 

Q: You flew in, right? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
14
A: Yeah, we flew in, and then
 they took us to the Union St
ation to bring us back to 
Richmond. 
Q: Mm-hm, the train station. 
A: So we stayed there, I don™
t know, several hours, overnight, and th en we were put on 
a train that™s coming to Richmond. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Now we came to Richmond, there was a 
railroad station which is now a mu seum, 
and we got off, and this guy from the Ladies
 Hebrew Benevolent 
took us, and ask if 
we were hungry, so he went across the str
eet to a restaurant. And we are not -- we -- 
we were not used to that food, see? They  ga
ve you the sliced bread, and I take a butter, 
and I put the butter, and the butter went th
ro ugh th e bread. You know, and we were 
eating rye bread and stuff, so we we
re not used to this kind of s -- 
Q: It was white, thin -- thin, white bread? 

A: Yeah, the sliced bread. I don™t know who invented it, but -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So, th at was kind of funny. And th
en we were end up
 in na -- North 19
th
 Street, and 
she was pregnant. Like -- like Mickey Rooney
 said one time, he was --  he was made 
in England, assembled in the United States. 
That™s what happened
 with our daughter. 
Q: Your little girl. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you had a little baby boy, too. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
15
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So, that™s what happened, and -- 
Q: Did th ey find you a job right away, or di
d you have to go out and find it yourself? 
A: Yeah, they -- they took me 
to a factory, and the place went on strike, and th e people 
I work with were real nice to
 me, y ou know, they were happy, and I -- gave me rides 
home. So  when  people went on strike, I we
nt with them. And the guy who owns the 
place, there was a Polish immigrant from World War One, I don™t know, he came from 

New York, and sat in a chair and he tri
pped me. If you don™t get 
off, I send you back 
to Poland. So that was a mess. 

Q: What kind of factory was it? 

A: There was tobacco machinery. I had th
e experience because during the war, in 
some concentration camps, I work  in a machinery place. So -- 

Q: Uh-huh. It was processing? 
Like, was it a processing tobacco? 
A:[indecipherable] mach
ine, I know that.  
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: So, you know, when 
I work in ge -- in Germany, in
 the machinery place, I was a 
prisoner, but everything has to be, like 30 
minutes before quitti
ng we had clean the 
machines, and I -- I came in here, and it™s th
e biggest mess I every seen in my life. 
Tools were laying on the fl -- you know, ho
w they waste stuff in here. Tools were 
laying on floor, you know? So  
I asked this guy, his name was Rudy Star, he was also a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
16
German newcomer, if I can cl
ean up, two, three weeks, pick up all the tools, you 
know, put them in a tool room. Then they went on strike. So I went to electronics. So 
from then on, I worked for -- yo
u -- you heard of Circuit City? 
Q: Uh-huh, yeah. 
A: Well, Circuit City started in Richmond. 
Q: Oh really?  
A: What happened, th ere was two -- I don™
t know if you want to hear that. 
Q: Sure. 

A: There was two guys, was Mr. Sainwerso. 
Sainwerso had relatives in Richmond, and 
he was on the way to  North Carolina buying 
land. So  wh en he stop in Richmond, see 
his relatives, there was no TV 
stores, that was 1948. So he
 got a friend working for -- a 
relative, for a TV factory in New York, which was called at the time, Olimpy. And he 
says, that™s a good place to m
ove. So he went back to Ne
w York, brought TVs in his 
trunk. And there was a tire store here downt
own, in [indecipherable] and there was a 
Jewish fellow, he says -- he gave
 him a corner to sell so me TVs. 
Q: In a tire store? 

A: Yeah, and those TVs went kind of fast -- 
Q: I bet. 

A: -- so he went and got more TVs, then 
he brought his partner, which was ha -- Mr. 
Haig from New York, and they 
open a store next to Sears, and call it Ward™s comp any. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
17
The reason called Ward™s, because Ward
sell was his name. At that time was 
Montgomery Wards, you see. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But -- but they start Ward™s, you know, 
W, Wardsell. Alan was his son, Ruth was 
his wife, and -- and s -- that he used to name the comp --  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- make Ward™s. And then they went su
ing Montgomery Ward, 
because they -- they 
didn™t put Montgomery on 
the front. So he got some 
-- I don™t remember all th e 
details, they sued Montgomery Ward, and he 
won. And -- and that™s the way it went, 
and then  they start up in mo re stores, and cl
othing, and all kind of 
finagling, and all of 
a sudden got a lot of employers, and ev erythi
ng and th en they bought Lafayette stores,  
I don™t know if you rememb er. Like Radio 
Sh ack, there was Lafayette stores, so he 
bought them. And -- and th e [indecipherabl
e] they were getting bigger, and bigger, 
that™s what Circuit City is now. So we us
ed  to have lunch with th e bosses every day, 
you know, with Mr. Wardsell. Matter 
of fact, when I [indecipherable] 
Q: And you -- did you go to  wo rk for them? 

A: Yeah.

Q: In ™40 -- when you 
-- in ™49, or ™50 -- 
A: Yeah, uh-huh. 
Q: Yeah, huh. 
A: Well -- and two of my witnesses when
 I become citizen, Mr. Haig and Mr. 
Wardsell, the -- the founders of Circuit City. 
Q: That™s interesting. So you wo
rked for them for -- for how long? 
A: For about -- almost 
11 years. Then I went in my  own busin ess. 
Q: Uh-huh. Well, what was it like for you 
to be here? Where -- whe -- did you speak 
very mu ch  English? 

A: Little by little, I was learning, I mean, you 
know. I keep checking at that time that I 
learn English, then I met some people from 
Poland, they tell me 
I sp eak Polish with 
the English accent. 

Q: Really, huh. Wh en you came, did yo
u speak anything -- any English at all? 
A: Very little. Not too much. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We didn™t have mu ch connections with Americans. 
Q: And what were your first 
impressions of this country,
 or did you -- did you have 
time to stop and think about it?  
A: Well, I don™t know, it was kind of commerc
ial, everythingwas m
oney. You go in a 
restaurant, you want the juke
box play, you had to put a money in  it. Everything was -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070

can -- then there was a lot of waste. I se
e somebody write with the pencil and then 
right there throw it away. I went and pi
cked it up, I said hey, that™s not -- 
Q: Even then, it was like that? 
A: Oh yeah. People thro wing stuff away. Yo
u go now in a thrift
 store, you™d be 
surprised at the stuff people get rid of, I 
mean like valuables, 
expensive stuff, and -- 
and they  do that, I don™t know
. They don™t have no patienc
e. People who call me gave 
me TVs for nothing. Right now here, day be
fo re yesterday I pick up two TVs. The 
lady says -- from New York , she says, ﬁI don™
t want them. You don™t want to take 
them, I™ll p u t them in a dumpster.ﬂ I says, ﬁI™
ll take them.ﬂ And th ey three or four year 
old TVs. People waste a lot of stuff here.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. What was it like for you 
so cially? Did you so cialize with other 
survivors, or not? 
A: Well, we were kind of pushed together 
because they keep us mo re or less together, 
but we had here new American Jewish club
, which was really fo
unded by the German 
immigrants. So we belong to
 that club, and everybody wa
s meetin g in there, and for 
several years, and -- but a lot of people le
ft Richmond, because 
Richmond was really 
dominated by th e -- we™re -- we™re supposed 
to be Ashkenazis, I don™t know, and th ey 
were dominated here by the Sephardic Jews
, you know, from Spai
n and Portugal. And 
then the German Jews came in
, an d they kind of got on th
e top of ev erything. I don™t 
know, they elect me presiden
t, I was the only Polish. They
 all -- there was a German 
club, and they -- they elect me president, I c
ouldn™t understand. So -- so a lot of people

just left. [indecipherable] people stayed an
d open grocery stores, because lab -- if you 
were a laborer, or something, there™s a lot 
anti-sem -- anti-Semitism here, Jew this, and 
Jew that, Jew ‚em down, Jew ‚em up. I had 
several fights. I was mad  after the war, 
somebody call me a name. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Bo leslaw Brodecki. This is tape on
e, side B. You said that there was -- you 
encountered some anti-Se
mitism on the job here. 
A: Oh yeah, there -- there was -- o n  the jo
b. And as a laborer, you -- I mean lik e one 
guy, wh ich was retired from [indecipherable]
 comp any, went to 
work for there for 
driving a taxi, and th ey call him Hebrew, y
ou know? There w -- there wa -- it -- it -- I 
don™t see it now as much as th
en. And they  said during th e 
war, they drew swastikas in 
the s -- they vandalized synagogues, but we 
didn™t make too mu ch
 fuss about it, even 
lately. 
Q: During which war? 
A: World War Two. 
Q: Uh-huh. There was vandalism here. 

A: Yeah, they put swastikas in
 -- in the departments to elev
ator and stuff like that. And 
vandalized some synagogues 
in a -- so I was in the Jewish community center, and it 
brought -- a lot of time they wouldn™t adver
tise it, because you say if you put it in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
21
paper, it™s getting kind of contagious. Theyjust -- small vandalizing of the Holocaust 
Museum here a few weeks ago, but we kind
 of keep it under cover. That was a few 
weeks ago, they vandalized
 the museum. And then we 
had committee in the Jewish 
Community  Center examining newspapers fro
m all over Virginia to find if it was anti-
Semitic tex t. And they were trying to
 publish a Christian telephone book, 
[indecipherable] buy it from [indecipherable] so 
that was a fight over that, and then we 
had another thing wh ich, with 
high schools, like during Jewish holidays, so they don™t 
-- they get credits, they can ma
ke up because th-this people 
of Jewish faith, that they 
wouldn™t go to school during th e Jewish hol -- 
Q: On th e holidays. 
A: That was a whole thing. 

Q: And this was in the 50™s? 
A: No, that was lately in le -- 
Q: Recently? 

A: -- last 1 0  years. 

Q: Yeah. What about i -- was 
-- was the anti-Sem
itism such that -- were you afraid? Or 
was it just annoying? 

A: It was annoying, because like I -- I gr
ew up in Warsaw, and I -- we are on the 
warpath, I mean there was anti-Semites in 
Warsaw, but we™re -- the Jewish guys, we 
were -- like I was carry ing a wrench and a ch
ain with me, somebody hit me, then I get 
him. We were -- we -- we were used to 
it, you know? And th en there were Jewish 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
22
stores in Poland where they -- they were 
working with signs, don™t buy -- don™t buy 
from a Jew, you know, so we were beating th
em up. I mean, there was a la -- th-that™s 
why I was in a place here  friends of ours, 
and -- and her son told her that they were 
talking something ag ainst Jews on the bus, 
the kids. So sh e says, ﬁDid you get off?ﬂ 
And he says yeah. And I say, ﬁWhen I was in
 Po land, we got in a fight, we didn™t get 
off.ﬂ But here, was a d ifferent attitude, you know. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So, we were annoyed, we 
still get annoyed with 
that kind of stuff, you know what I 
mean? 
Q: But it never got to the poin
t -- there was never so much 
that you were afraid that 
something would happen to you
 or your family, or -- 
A: Why? Y-You get afraid because some 
things will overpower you, no matter what 
you do, you get overpowered. 
If you see somebody seven foot 
tall, a giant, and you™re 
a little fello w, sure, you™re going 
to run. Like David and Goliath. 
Q: Right. Bu t were there things that you 
would avoid doing, or 
places you would avoid 
going, or something, because you were a fraid there might be a confrontation? 

A: In Poland? 
Q: Here, I™m talking about here. 

A: I -- I -- I really couldn™t recall it. I ne
ver been that bad, you know, actually. 
Q: Uh-huh, that™s what I™m trying to u
nderstand, you know, 
the degree of it. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
23
A: No, no, no th ey weren™t that
 bad, just mo stly vandalism, or stuff like that. And it 
happened now with th
e -- they say it™s on the increase. 
So, read it in the paper, they 
say it™s on the increase [indecipherable] this 
-- i-i-it™s complicated
 because, you know, 
in the United States, in the -- in the Congre
ss, or what, they vote, and they try to -- 
people be against Israel, against Jews, so
 they spend mo ney now, try to push that 
propaganda because everything
 if -- they [indecipherable]
 last summer, and they -- 
they voted on. So they try to
 turn people opinion of it. 
So it™s nice w h en -- when the 
Saudi Arabian prince was trying 
to give six million dollars 
to -- at New York, to the 
mayor, he refused to take it, you remember? 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yeah. 
A: So. 

Q: When  -- when  your kids started to get older -- 
A: It was Giuliani was -- what I am talking about. 
Q: Pardon me? 

A: Giuliani is -- 

Q: Giuliani, yeah. 
A: He refused -- they give him six million dol
lars, he refused to take it, even after 9-
11. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. When  your kids started 
getting old enough to wonder where their 
grandparents were, you know, why don™t we ha
ve relatives here, that kind of thing. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
24
Did they  ask you questions, did you tell th
em, did you want to tell them what had 
happened to you? 
A: Wh -- when they were little
 we didn™t talk about it. 
Now when they started getting 
mature, th-they were going to 
that center and all that, they were finding out things for 
themselves. It was -- I don™t know, the fir -- th
e la -- last -- first 10 or 15 years, nobody 
was really talking about. And people really 
picked up in terest after the ™67 war in  
Israel. Even here we had troubles. We we
re collecting money for Jewish welfare for 
Israel, and one guy who is a 
lawyer said, ﬁI don™t give 
to causes like that,ﬂ you know 
what I mean. And I ask one time, ah -- I -- ow
ner of a big Jewish comp any store, he™s 
retired, so I said now you ca -- you can visit 
Israel. He says, ﬁThat™s the last place I 
want to be.ﬂ You know? So th ere was, ev
en among th e Jews, there was some kind of a 
way, wh en they was talking from years ago 
when  delegation went to Roosev elt about 
what™s going on and -- and it was --  
Q: During th e war, mm-hm. 

A: -- some ga -- and he says kee -- keep 
him out of here. You know, I mean the -- so 
where they making the mistake is 
like that you try to be loyal to a country, right? Like 
the Germans, right? They were fighting Wo
rld War One, they were loyal Germans, 
they got iron crosses, it didn™t make any 
difference. Yo -- you know what I mean? And 

here is s -- well, we love Am
erica and everything, but you cannot forget that it™s still -- 
you got forces against you. No  ma
tter which -- you rememb er Rikover? 
Q: Rikover? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
25
A: He was a Jewish admiral. 
Q: Yeah, Hyman Rikover. 
A: Yeah, he -- he went with the [indecipherab
le] with the -- to the 
North Pole, the first 
-- 
Q: He was a nuclear submarine admiral. 
A: Yeah, and he was day and night on the trai
n checking out, and they -- and they say, 
ﬁI hope you get enough medals to fall in 
the water and drown.ﬂ They even took him 
for congressional hearings. Th
ey said, ﬁAre you ready?ﬂ He says, ﬁYeah.ﬂ I took a 
shave, and I shower and put a clean [indecipherable] 

Q: When  you were young, befo re the wa
r, were you active in pro Zionist kinds of 
causes, or did you -- 

A: Yeah, we got -- we had that. We had Macc
abi, that was a Jewish organization. And 
there were -- there were two kinds, there were Zionists, and ba -- Betarof Jews. Betar -

- there was guy who was -- they said that he 
was a military kind of a -- matter of fact, 
we were in Israel, and we couldn™t get to his grave, they  
say. They were against it for 
some reaso n . I don™t know, like s -- you got 
parties, like here Re
publicans. Jeez, over 
there you got a labor party, you got diffe
ren -- different -- but we were Zionist. 
Q: Mm-hm. And your father, t
oo, your mo ther and father? 
A: I -- I couldn™t tell you really. I don™t know. 
Q: But as a -- as a young man, you were a -- a teenager, I guess.  
A: Uh-huh. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
26
Q: You di -- you were active in those things
. So this was a natural extension of your 
interests from before the war -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- when you came here. 

A: Well, we have one cousin who is [i
ndecipherable] and they got unifo rms and 
things, and they were marching 
across Poland, going to Israel
 to fig h t. But they broke 
it up at the -- that was Lola™s brother. He 
wa -- he was a lawye
r, and then he turn 
Communist. In Poland th
ey were -- a lot of the Jews 
were Communist, and -- and first 
of May, he slept in our house, so he di
dn™t get arrested for be
ing Communist. You see 
the ru -- Russia was a big disappointment. I 
ran o -- ran off on the Russian side during 
the war, because Poland was kind of chopped in  half. And when  we got there they said 

they were the -- everybody™s 
equal and all that, but still 
was anti-Semitism. And they 
put you in jail if you call somebody like here a 
Jew. They say evrai. That was against 
the law to do that, but 
they still were doing it. 
Q: Hm. Given that you were active, what -- 
what -- what was it that made you want to 
come to the United States in
stead of go to Israel, when you had a choice? Or was it 
just that U.S. -- 

A: I ha -- I -- I -- I didn™t have a choice. 

Q: You didn™t. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
27
A: That was -- we were -- first of all, 
where everybody wants 
to go United States 
because, you know, is a -- gold is in the st
reets, you know. But what happened, I told 
you we were turned 
back from Israel -- we were in Germany. 
Q: Oh that™s right, when 
you were by yourself, yeah. 
A: Uh-huh. And then when we register, I 
was married then, when we register. We 
were accepted in here to come only to Ri
chmond -- come only [indecipherable] we 
went here. You know, when  I was in Germ
any after the war, we were -- we were 
actually preparing go to Israel. We were
 even -- had th e undergro und. There was 
[indecipherable] and -- and other organiza
tions, so we -- like we was -- I was a 
policeman, and we had duty with American 
soldiers, and you know, we were talking 
about waste? Three hours later the -- the truc
k come and brang thes
e soldiers, and pick 
them up, they left the coats, the guns, the 
shoes, they went -- so we were -- we were 
taking all that and -- and sending it to 
Israel. We -- we were buying guns, and 
grenad es, you know, that -- the-
there was kind of smuggle -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Everything was work ing for Israel. 
Q: While you were a policeman? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. I guess that was pretty common then. 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
28
Q: Yeah. I want to go back 
to something you started to 
talk about before when you 
came to Richmond and you 
found out that there was segregation here, racial 
segregation, that -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- it was very disappointing for you. 
A: Yeah, we -- we really didn™t have no id
ea about it, but there we
re booklet given to 
us, and they says that we will encounter th
at, and they advised us that we always 
should be on the side of 
the right team, we shouldn™t worry about it -- I mean, we 
should be against it in our government. 

Q: Who wrote this booklet? 
A: I don™t  know, the U.S. government. 

Q: Really? 
A: They gave us a book that
 we will encounter this kind of stuff, we were not to be 
afraid to be against it, this a free country, 
an d so on, and so on. Bu
t we really run into 
that. And what would -- what got me is 
so me th ing  we rememb ered  fro m German y , 
you know, the -- they paint a 
picture for Jews, terrible thing, but then if you were a 
friend with a German, he going to say, ﬁThe
 Jews are no good, but you are different.ﬂ 
Because he didn™t know the o-others. A
nd we encountered the 
same thing, like I 
worked for Ward™s, and we went -- the Windsor
 farms is the -- here that was exclusive 
area, no Catholics, no Jews
, no blacks. And is a -- 
Q: And what was it called? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
29
A: Windsor Farms.  
Q: Windsor Farms. What was it?  
A: Yeah. It™s just a area, you know, like a -- 
Q: Subdivision, like 
where people live -- 
A: No, no, it™s 
in the city. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But they -- they were like a -- there wa
s no Jews, no blacks, no Catholics, you 
know, even then. So I go to 
service TV, and -- and the maid, and the lady of the house, 

and all  watch TV soap operas. On the buses th
ey couldn™t sit togeth
er, so I say, what™s 
that? Oh, Mary is different, you know? When
 I worked for Ward™s, there were black 
drivers, you know, who were real -- a real 
low grade of people, not because they  were 
black, but they were 
alcohol, this, that. During lunc
h all the women from the office, 
everybody sits together, so I 
say, ﬁYou -- you hate them, 
why do you sit with them?ﬂ 
ﬁOh, Norman, Jimmy, th
ey are different,ﬂ you know? Th
en one day they -- they send 
me to service a TV, some bl
ack men brought a TV, and the TV broke down, and that 

was surprise for his wife. So 
they want me to go first there and fix the TV, and it was 
lunchtime, so I said, ﬁI ge
t there, I gonna make him fix me lunch.ﬂ And -- and -- and 
the girl in the office say, ﬁYou can™t eat at 
a nigger™s.ﬂ So I say, 
ﬁEvery restaurant you 
go, they™re work in the kitche
n. What the heck is the diffe
rent?ﬂ That was -- wa-was a 
story, which I don™t know if it™s true, but it™
s mo re or less a joke, you might heard it. 
Can I tell you? This -- during th e war, all th
e men was in the army  in Europe, here 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
30
there, and there was a graduation here, in 
the Windsor Farms, which is -- so the lady 
called Camp Lee, and asked the general to 
send so me GI™s to ask all the girls to 
graduation. And befo re she finished, she sa ys, ﬁWe -- w e a nice Christian family, and 
please don™t send any Jews.ﬂ So here the gr
aduation day, a bus pu
lls up fu ll of black 
people. And one black guy knock on th e door
 and says to the lady -- and she said, 
ﬁWhat do you want?ﬂ ﬁWe came 
here to ask out the girls to graduation.ﬂ Sh e says, 
ﬁThat must be a mistak e.ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he said
, ﬁthe general send us.ﬂ She said, ﬁThe 
general mu st made a mistake.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁLady, General Schwartz never made a 

mistake in his life.ﬂ A nd I got a [indecipherable] 
Q: What the heck. 
A: You can [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 
A: They said they -- 
Q: So what -- when the -- when
 your kids went to school, were the public schools all 
segregated? 

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Yeah. And what -- 
A: We would have a problem here, becaus
e they were signing a petition th -- when 
they went to the public school here, the lo
wer school, they  were segregated, so they 
call all the parents to sign a petition that they
 don™t want any black
 people in here. I 
refused to sign it. But they took it wrong.They say, ﬁThey will come in, it™s serious, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
31
you better sign it.ﬂ And I -- I 
say, ﬁI didn™t sign it on account of that, I just don™t 
believe in it.ﬂ They say, ﬁIf you don™t sign it, 
they couldn™t go to school.ﬂ I still didn™t 
sign it. I was stubborn. 
Q: And the kids still went to school. 

A: Now when I see black people who are an
ti-Semites, I say I don™t know which way 
[indecipherable] 

Q: But did your kids 
go to that school? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Kreschee elementary. 
Q: What year was 
that? In the 60™s? 
A: Yeah, there wa -- there was -- in ™58 - ™59, or something like that. She went there wi 
-- to school, she parked  the car, and sh e came on 
the other side of th
e building, told her 
the car was stolen. She called the police. Sh
e came in from one end, and co me out the 
other end, and no car.  
Q: Whoops. Oh. 
A: So, she didn™t see the [i
ndecipherable] there was a green car, now there was another 
one.  
Q: During those years, the 50™s and the 60™s, 
I -- I gather that their knowledge -- public 
knowledge about the Ho
locaust in this coun
try was very small. 
A: Yeah, we -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
32
Q: People either did -- often didn™t -- claime
d that they didn™t know, or it just was not 
discussed. 
A: No, it wa-wasn™t -- ver-very little knowledge
, and -- and that™s why the museum is 
doing a great job, have teache
r seminars here, they™re doing a great job. Th-T h-They  
got seminars for teachers all the time, we ta
lk  to schools -- I™ve been speaking schools 
and churches. Of course, not as much as 
some people who are retired, but I -- like 
some guy tows -- we were in Rockfield, 
and he says too many mu seums open up, but 
the idea is just like a lot of Walmart open up
, to reach mo re people, and th e same thing 
a Holocaust Museum. For example, people wh ich come here, would never go to  

Washington, so the knowledge is important that people know about it. 
Q: Right. 

A: Not only on account of the Jews, there wa
s a lot of, you know, 
especially in the 
Middle East, they killing peop
le off in Africa. You know, 
the Tutsis and the Hutus?  
Q: Rwanda, yeah. 

A: It cha -- Rwanda they chop hundred s of 
heads off and -- right now, and -- and it™s 
not a territorial kind of thing, it™s just ra-raci
st kind of thing, be
cause you know, so the 
knowledge, you know, tolerance 
is very important, and they do a heck  of a job here.  
Q: Hang on a second. 

A: Tours, and ev erything. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
33
Q: We were talking about your -- when  you
 came and -- and you 
were unhappy, very 
discourag ed  about the racial discriminati
on that you saw here. Did you jo in in any 
marches, or do anything like that? 
A: There was nothing of that kind here. 

Q: There wasn™t? No? 
A: No, I mean, I did not like it, but the -- th
ere wasn™t much you 
could do ab out it, but 
you just did no -- disagree with the situation. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Wa -- one day when we move over here, 
we invited th e people 
who help ed us move 
to the table, and there was black man and 
all, and -- and there was one -- a white guy, 
and I keep  him in the other room. And then  
he said, ﬁHow come you didn™t invite me  
to the kitchen?ﬂ I say, ﬁYou are southern
, and you don™t like black people, I didn™t 
want to offend you, we don™
t mind.ﬂ He says, ﬁDamn it, let me  go in there.ﬂ And he 
came in and sat with us, remember? Because we said he came in later, we sit d o wn, 

there was Jimmy  Glynn, there was a couple wh
o help  us move, and we had dinner with  
them, and this white guy, he said, ﬁHow co
me you don™t invite me there?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ I 
say, ﬁyou a southerner, you don™t like black 
people, I didn™t want to have any friction.ﬂ 
ﬁDamn it, I™m going.ﬂ And he came in and 
sat with us. But I me
an, that is -- there 
weren™t much you can do about it, because 
we were guests over here. Couple of times 
people said, ﬁYou don™t like it, 
why don™t you go back  home?ﬂ 
Q: They did? People 
said that to you? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
34
A: Yeah, uh-huh. 
Q: They did? 
A: Yeah. Ak -- a few times that
 -- and they  say, if you 
don™t like it, why don™t you go 
back where you came from? Like I in
terfere with somebody else™s --  
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: So, we were kind -- in the middle.  
Q: Yeah. What about wh
en -- when -- when the Vietnam war happened. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: You must have had -- any kind of war mu
st have brought out some strong feelings 
in you, I would think. 

A: Well, basically, we unde
rstood -- I don™t know everyb
ody did, Nixon wrote an 
article in Reader™s Digest at
 the time, if the Communists ta
ke over there, all the routes, 
trade and co mmerce, everything going to be
 affected, if -- if the Vietnam turned 
Communist, then -- we -- we didn™t like what
 was going on, but it looked to us like it 
was the right thing to do at the time. But we
 didn™t know that 
so much politics were 
involved, because -- what was 
[indecipherable] was 
that port [indeci
pherable] and now 
the supplies were coming in, and they never bombed that, they bomb ed it somewhere 

else. Then when  Nixon went to Cambodia with
 the universities here protest, and it was 
-- you had to study the whole thing, really, 
to understand what wa
s going on there. We 
didn™t like -- the lot of people -- a lot of g
uys went to Canada, th
ey  don™t want to get 
drafted, and we didn™t like it eith er, our 
son was in college, so he had a college 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
35
deferments, though, and he was a heck of 
a baseball player, they were trying to get 
him in major leagues. 
Q: Baseball? 
A: Mm-hm. We had scouts about him, oh,
 we had New York 
Yankees, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, and -- and we had a friend here, Ed
die Casko, he was a ma jor league player, 
and he came, and we beg him to talk Gerard
 go in to baseball, beca
use he wo uld had to  

quit college, if he quit college, they send 
him to Vietnam. We came out of a war, I 
mean, you know. They -- so he 
came in here, and talked to Joe, he says, and the major 
league is only 500 people, a
nd half of them are black, and another part is South 
American, and a red blooded American boy d
on™t really get a chance to get in the 
major league, and th at™s the onl
y way to be, if you get in. 
And -- and tried talk him out 
of doing it, you see. S-So he kept in colle
ge, and he went to the National Gu ard. By  
that time, the war ended. But we didn™t r
eally want him go to Vietnam. He went to 
Israel twice when the war started, he vo
lunteer. Well, I cou -- we couldn™t stop him 
then. 
Q: Did you want to stop him? 
A: Yeah, she want to stop him. We didn™t 
like him to do th at, but we have friends in 
Israel, and their kids were in the army, and 
I just didn™t feel like mo rally, I have the 
right to stop him. He sold everyt
hing, he went to Israel, and a -- 

Q: And he was a volunteer in a kibbutz? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
36
A: Yeah, but the idea is -- yeah, 
but the idea is that Israel is  very particular about their 
soldiers. If you go there they
 don™t take you in the army , because you have no 
experience. They  di -- put you in th e kibbutz
 and different places
. And he was in one 
kibbutz, there were rats, there was nothing 
to eat. Yeah, you know, it™s -- but he went, 
he went. We couldn™t stop him. 
Q: Did you try to st -- talk him out of it? 
A: Well, she was trying to talk him out of
 it as a mother, but I never said a word, 

because I just morally I feel 
like I have no right to do it.
 Cause a mother is a mother, 
you know. 
Q: Hang on. 
A: That was the ™67 -- not, that was the ™83,
 I think. Wa -- wa -- one of the wars. I 
think ™67 he was too young. 
Q: ™73? 
A: Maybe. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Maybe, yeah. Boy, he -- the war didn™
t take very long, so that was all over. 
Q: Ra -- in the sevend -- late -- late 70™s, 
or early 80™s, there was -- when  there started 
to be a lot of awareness in th
is country, a lot of public 
discussion about the Ho locaust. 
A: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
37
Q: There was a television prog
ram about the Holo caust, and a lot of people, you know, 
who didn™t know about it before, or didn™t learn about it, became aware of it. And it™s 
been getting mo re and mo re
 in the -- in the people™
s consciousness since then. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: What -- what -- what was happening with 
you at that time? Did -- did you feel the 
need to sp eak out more? Were you aw
are of this going on around you?  

A: Well, there was -- there -- there was a ge
neral trend between [indecipherable] and 
Jewish community to have 
speakers go to schools, I went to several schools. 
Q: You did? 
A: Uh-huh, oh yeah, I -- I got the -- I got
 that many letters, I know, from different 
places where I was sp eaking. I got a whole library of it. 
Q: What did you talk about? 
A: About the Holocaust. 
Q: About what ha
ppened to you? 

A: What happened to  me, and 
-- and other ways in the -- after we through, I™ll show 
you something. I spoke to the governor™s 
school several times. You know wh ere the 
governor™s school is. Outsta
nding students, above averag
e. They have a separate 
school for them, they call it governor™s sch
ool. And because they cannot surv ive in a 
regular school, because they are above 
average, you know? 
So they call it the 
governor™s school. Matter of fact, they just
 build thas -- got a new building ju st for 
that. So I talked to th e governor™s school
 couple times, and Univ ersity of Richmond. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
38
And I went to Luth eran church, high schools
. At the beginning I took my  son a couple 
of times, because I need some 
criticism. And so he gave me some hints, he -- the SS is 
storm troop, th -- that was th
e bad people in Germany. 
Q: Storm troopers, yeah. 
A: Yeah, so like Gestapo, SS. So he says, 
ﬁDon™t say that, say German guards, because 
when  s -- y-you use SS  here, it™s like suppor
t Saddam. You know, like -- said don™t use 

that term b ecause the kids don
™t know what the SS. And th
en -- and then people would 
say if I have any narrow escap
es, and he says, ﬁWell tell th
em that you had one foot in 
the grave, and one on a banana peel.ﬂ So that
 was his advice to -- I w ant them to listen, 
I want to tell them, because my English was limited, so --  

Q: What was that lik
e for you to talk? 
A: I don™t know, I just kept talking. I -- 
I didn™t have no -- any 
script, you know. And 
then I-I tried to shorten my talk and answer
 questions, because you 
go to schools, the 
kids are in different grades, and different 
mentality, you know. So 
I don™t want to -- I 
didn™t want to talk above or be
low. So I talk for a time, and 
then I said, ﬁI want to hear 
some questions.ﬂ Then I can go out to 
what they want to hear, you know? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Boleslaw Brodecki. This 
is tape numb er two, side A. You were telling me  before 
about visiting -- ta-t-talking to the school ki
ds, and -- and college kids, too, I guess. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Both . And you showed me the certifi
cate you got from the Virginia Governor™s 
school. When you started -- when  you starte
d talking to  kids, did -- what did -- did it 
do so mething fo r you? I know I™ve read 
letters from school kids to Ho locaust 
survivors, and I think I have a sense of how 
powerful an experience 
it is for the kids to 
hear those firsthand, it™s different from read
ing it in a book. But what is it like for you 
to tell those stories, to go th rough those 
memories over and over, and i-it -- is there 
something -- do you like doing it? 

Q: Well, see, not being a professional spea
ker, or politician who wants to get elected 
[indecipherable] so our motiv
es are -- are different, yo
u know? You don™t speak for 
popularity, or -- so first of all, what it doe
s to you, it refreshes your memo ry. Because 
if you don™t talk about it, it kind of fades 
out. You™d be surprise
d how that comes out. 
At one time I went, and -- she, when we 
had something happen, a robbery , you know, 
and she was very mu ch affected, and we went
 to psychiatrist, and sat in front of the 
psychiatrist, put you in the mood, all of
 a sudden you rememb er
 things you never 

thought you were gonna rememb er. I don™t 
know -- and by talking to  the kids, and 
students, helps you -- your ow
n picture of what happened.
 Yo -You do mo re analyzing, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
40
and remembering. Maybe if you wouldn™t ta
lk about it 20 years, you ju st -- and -- and 
the reaction make you feel good that they un
derstand what you talking about, like this 
time I talk to the governor™s school, the kids 
call me that I™m a hero
. Then several girls 
asked me if I can adopt them. 
And a -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s -- in a way, it™s sad but it™s fun. 
One day I said to a guy, a Jewish fellow,
 we had a sh -- like a Yom HaShoah or 
something, and all the horrible stuff, and I 
asked a guy, ﬁDid you enjoy the show?ﬂ He 
said, ﬁHow can you ask me if I enjoyed it, 
it™s not something to enjoy, you know.ﬂ Bu t 
you enjoy the reaction. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You feel like you make friends, and -- 
and you doing fo r a good cause, because 
some people say it never happened, you kn
ow, and it -- a-and you get kind of, say 
heck, I -- it never happened, I have a number 
here, and they tell me it never happened , 
I™m a liar, y ou know. So you want 
to show you -- your side of the story, that this is not 
a lie, that it really happened. So this
 is one good part of it, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. But for some people, too, rememb
ering is not a pleasant thing, and they 
don™t want to do it, and they refuse to
 do it -- to go tell those stories, is -- 
A: Well, that -- that™s some people like 
that. Some people don™t want to see any 
movies, anything ab out it, because they say th
ey just can™t take it. Her doctor, she ask 
him if he -- 
A: Mine heart doctor. My cardiologist. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
41
A: -- if he -- if he was in the Holocaust Mu
seum, he says he just couldn™t take it. I -- I 
had to take head shot
s for the movies -- 
Q: Head shots. 
A: You know. 

Q: Yeah, publicity, like -- 
A: Now, wa -- yo-you got cas
ting places, when they need 
you, they  call you, but they 
got to have a picture. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Like the director comes to Richmond, they
 going to make a mo vie, say I want him, 
and I want her, you know. So  they  had those 
pictures. So I went 
to the guy who take 
pictures, and -- and -- and we said somethi
ng about Ho locaust and 
the guy got crying. 
Q: Crying? 
A: Crying. Was a -- 
Q: Because you told -- he -- you -- it came out
 that you were a survivor, and he cried? 
A: Yeah, he got crying. So my daughter said  don™t pay attention to him. He says -- she 

was work ing for a big comp any, she got fired 
for some reason, so he says -- her -- her 
boss who fire her, he also was crying ab out Ho locaust, but she -- she got fired 

anyways. So  she said, don™t pay attention to him. 

Q: I lost my train of thought. 
A: Can I ask you a question, are you Jewish? 
Q: No, I™m not. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
42
A: No, what -- I shouldn™t be that inquis
itive. What is your religion? Are you an 
atheist, or what? 
Q: No, I was -- you know, I™ve -- I™ve had an
 opportunity to interview a lot of 
American combat veterans from World War 
Two, and many of them had very  ta -- 
gruesome, terrible experiences, and experience
d all their lives afte
r they came back, 
flashbacks, you know? 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Where sudden ly they  would be driving do
wn a road , and all of a sudden th ey would 
reme mb er something so vividly, they would 
have to stop driv ing, because it was so 
difficult for them, so real, those images were so
 real. Did that happen to you, too, that 
kind of thing? 

A: I-I couldn™t recall it. Some I 
recall, but not that intensive. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- that there was some
 horrible stuff, I mean -- 
Q: I mean, you had a very, very
 difficult, horrible experience. 
A: Yeah, I wa -- I -- 

Q: And for a long period of time. 
A: Yeah, I was like -- I was in like seven 
concentration camps. The reason that many, 
because when -- when the Russi
ans started advancing, they keep moving us, you see. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
43
And a lot of time we were not even guarded,
 and -- but there was no place to go, there 
was January, was snow like this, a
nd you go -- you had -- it was like in 
[indecipherable] everybody co
uld -- now th at you are in the -- and there was no place 
to run, you know. I was in 
the shlinterlovitch which was al
so on Upper Silesia. One of 
the foremans was not a prisoner, she was a civ
ilian. And he was trying to help me to 
escape. And I didn™t trust him. I didn™t go in
 for it, I didn™t trust him. And after the war 
I find out he become police chief in that ar
ea, because people were
 tu rning you in, you 
cou -- you didn™t know who to  trust. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: At least you were alive momentarily, a
nd next day they -- somebody turn  you in, 
you get shot, so -- especially in the winte
r, it™s cold, and I mean you c -- you couldn™t 
survive, you know. But the flas
hback, that™s -- when we were
 talk, it comes back to a s 
-- when you talk to kids, you know. 
Q: Yeah. Th-the question about trust, is so
mething I want to ask you about, too. How 
did it -- how did you, over time, deal with th
e question of trust, 
trusting other people, 
and knowing that somebody wouldn™t turn  
on you somehow, or how -- how co uld you 
assume that people were good? 

A: Well, some I have no choice, you know, so
me I -- that™s the only choice, you had to 
trust somebody. Fo r example, when I was 
in one camp, working a vakhar, wh ich is 
like a industrial place, and the railroad tracks 
on both ends of the -- whatever you call 
that. And there were guards, and they were
 calling a guy -- you know, we didn™t have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
44
anything, exe -- a little piece of cigarette, you
 know, where they th
row it away, so the 
guard s say, come on, get it. And he threw it on the other side of the track, where 
you™re not supposed to be, so
 the guy go there, get it, and he sa -- killed him, you 
know? So -- and I had one of them, when we
 were marching to work, he passed by me 
and gave me some dry bread, put it in my
 pocket. Then  when  he was on guard, he 
called me, he says -- well, I trusted him, he 
says, ﬁAfter the war, I have a farm, you™re 
going to  be my  coucher.ﬂ You know? And then
 he, one day he says
 he™s in trouble, 
because if they find 
a guard helping the -- what they ca
lled at the time haftlinga, which 
is prisoners, they get punish ed, they might 
put them in a concen
tration camp . So he 
says, ﬁSomebody, I think, see me helping you.
 We have to do so mething, we have to 
do so mething. I™m in trouble.ﬂ So I said, ﬁW
hat we do?ﬂ He says, ﬁYou come up here, 
and when  you co me up, I™m going to start 
to call you bad names, and kick you, and 
call you,ﬂ -- So I said, ﬁFine.ﬂ So I went ov
er there, he said, ﬁYou faftlifter, you the 
bingabanga woo woo woo.ﬂ Then when  I we
nt away I [indecipher
able] so it w o rked 
out pretty good. Bu t you didn™t know who to
 trust, you know, some na --  people 
hanging. People kill you for -- fo
r -- for a bite of bread, and a -- especially when you in 
the camp, you see hungry peop
le go mean. When  we came 
to Mauthausen, they put 
300 of us in a area ma ybe like those two ro
oms double, so they tell us to take the 
clothes off, put them together, and lay like -- 
like sardines against 
the wall. When they 
got another row, they  had to put their le
gs between your legs, and another row, and 
another row. Now, it™s cold, and people got 
to urin ate a lot. At night, you cannot get 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
45
up, if you get up, you step on other people, y
ou can get beaten. So  if you really had to 
go, you™d jump , and you™d ru
n on pe-people, and -- and yo
u made up with a couple 
guys you -- you were laying 
with to show what place yo
u left. And -- and -- and -- and 
it was a horrible thing because 
some people couldn™t reach it. 
Q: Oops. Hold that thought. 
A: Some people couldn™t leave, so
 -- so they just -- 
so they just -- just urinate, so you 
get up in  the mo rning it™s wet all over. And wa
 -- one night I was the -- see, we talking 
about after the war, we got back in the war th
is time. That what you say, we can jump  
back? 

Q: I know. It™s okay. Yeah. 
A: I was [indecipherable]
 and I supposed to have typhus, and 
I have a constant noise in my 
ears. I couldn™t eat, I coul dn™t keep balance. 
So a friend of mi ne, I 
gave him my portion of 
bread, so he was carrying me around so they 
don™t catch me , because if they say you™re 
disabled, bingo. So what happened here, when I 
came  to the factory, I couldn™t keep balance, 
so the guy make me work, and I didn™t make it, 
so they send me  back in the barracks. Now, 
during lunchtime or something, the guys were co
mi ng in, back to the barracks. So, there were 
bunkbeds. On every bunkbed, there was day shift and 
night shift was just one place to sleep ta 
-- every bunkbed was filled, three or four
 people. And, you know, you couldn™t ge t in, 
because they push you out. So finally I sat on the 
edge of one, and I had a belt, which was cut 
in half so fix my wooden shoes so I don™t lose
 them, you know?  So I t
ook the -- th
e belt I got 
in my pants, and put it around my throat, and 
I sit on the edge of the bunk, and tie it up, and I 

jump, to hang myself. And I lost conscious, 
you know?  I open my eyes, I™m on the fl oor, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
46
the guy who I was giving the portion of bread, 
which was [indecipherable] he says, ﬁYou™re 
going to mi ss your bread portion.ﬂ And I could notmove, I™m all shaked up, 
so he said it three 
times, and he left, because he was afraid to lose
 his portion. So then I sa
y -- I had a little metal 
box, and there was a half a razor, and a couple ci
garette butts. So I said, ﬁI™m going to do the 
Japanese stuff,ﬂ you know? 
Q: Kill yourself with it. 

A: Some body picked my  pocket, and it was gone
. So then I lay, I -- I don™t know how long, I 
finally got up, and -- and I was crawling around, 
trying to lay down some where, and the one 
bunk is -- only one person was there. So I figur
ed he must be one of the kapos, you know, the 
fore -- forema ns?  So I can keep him -- one f
oot on the ground, and somehow I slip beside 
him, and I think I went to sleep. In the 
morning, some body wa ke me , and the guy say, ﬁYou 
better get away from there.ﬂ 
I say, ﬁWhy? ﬂ ﬁSomebody urinate, 
and there™s urine under the 
bed in there. Gestapo, when they come , they ba 
-- beat the heck out of you.ﬂ So I want to be 

nice, so the guy was laying besi
de it, I say -- try deliver 
the me ssage, you understand -- the 
guy on the other side, ﬁLeave that ma n alone, he b
een dead since last night.ﬂ That™s why he 
was sleeping alone. So -- 
Q: When you got out -- when you came here, 
though, and -- how did you l
earn to trust people 
again?  Or did you? 
A: We ll, that was [indecipherable] I didn™t 
tell anybody how keep my money anything, I 
didn™t know [indecipherable] tr
ust. I didn™t do anything excep
t somebody can tell me, and 
there was just regular, every 
day life. You know, there™s no -- no ma tter of trust. There was no 
question of trusting, because there were no 
dangerous [indecipherable] illegally trust 
some body, a nd they get you.  It™s ju
st -- I don™t know how to -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
47
Q: But I would think that even in the -- 
even in normal, every day life, you have 
circumstances where you could assume  that so
mebody is trying to take advantage of you in 
one way or another. You know, it may not be
 a life or death kind of situation -- 
A: Well yeah, well, 
if you -- if you -- 
Q: -- but it could be in a normal cour
se of interaction, you could -- 
A: Yeah, well -- 
Q: -- you could have an
 attitude that everybody™s out to 
get you. That would be easy to 
assume. 
A: Well, tha -- that™s -- no, I -- I don™t think I was in that way. Well, usually when you 

make a transaction with somebody, people mi
 -- we were trusting, we were given the 
wrong [indecipherable] the insurance man sell
 me insurance, and half of it weren™t 
true. The -- if you went to buy a car, they 
tell you lies, you know, this certain amount 
here of like salesmanship here
, where people, they -- they 
say at [indecipherable] I got 
super salesman, and they got 
a super stupid people go in 
f-for the sales talk, I mean, 
you know? And a lot of time, 
people figured  that you are -- 
this has nothing to do with 
it, but a lot of time people figured  that you don™t know anything. To give you example, 
when there was a -- a -- a -- they were goi
ng -- like the president, there was between 
Nixon and Kennedy. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: So me and my  son to ok very mu ch inte
rest. We got a book fro
m Kennedy, ﬁProfiles 
of Courag e,ﬂ and we read the paper, we even
 listen to [indecipherable] radio, and all 
that. Where I go to fix a TV, and there was 
a guy, he™s a president of this huge 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
48
comp any. I think his name was West, or he
 live on West Avenue, he says, ﬁMr. 
Brodecki, when you 
finish working on TV, I want
 to talk to you.ﬂ He was 
campaigning for Nixon. Okay, he not ask me 
if I know anything about it or not. So he 
says, ﬁYou sit down, I want to tell you so 
-- a little bit about Mr. Nixon.ﬂ So I played 
dumb, I said, ﬁHow did you know him, wher
e did you meet him?  Did you,ﬂ -- no, no, 
no. I said, ﬁDid you go to school with him?
ﬂ No, no, no. I say -- I didn™t tell him that I 
already knew more about it than he does. He
 was telling me -- he wanted to tell me all 
about Mr. Nixon, like I was -- I came out of 
the woods, so you got 
a lot of things like 
that here. Like you go look at 
the car, he says that™s the best car, and then you read the 
Consumer Reports, you know exactly who -- 
who -- what it is with that. A lot of 
people are just, you know, that way. A -- a 
woman ask me thi -- wh
en I was work ing at 
Ward™s what™s the best television to buy.If I tell her, she buys something else. I say, 
ﬁHow come you did?ﬂ Oh, salesm
an told me that this is be
tter. So you talk about trust, 
who is -- you trust, people -- you can not be 
knowledgeable on ev ery field. So people 
will tell you stuff, and you believe it. But this 
is differen t kind of 
trust, during the war, 
where your life is in danger, you know, or your
 future. I mean there™s different degrees 
of trust. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So, I don -- I know exactly what you™re 
asking, but I -- I don™t 
know how to answer 
it correctly. 

Q: Well, I don™t know what the right answ er 
is, so I™m just throwing it out there.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
49
A: I don™t trust one area, but the other area,
 you™re too ig norant not to trust, do you 
know what I mean? 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: I wou -- I wou -- what hit me w h en we cam
e here is the -- the advertisement, when 

they were advertising cigarettes, every 
cigarette was the best, you know? Pall Mall 
was the special people™s smoke, and [indeciphe
rable] is th is, and that -- and we -- we 
didn™t -- we weren™t used to that kind of adve
rtisement. It™s just like I was driving here 
one time a couple years ago, and -- and sees
 a lot of restaurants in Richmond. The 
Barkley Hotel dining room is 
above a mall. I went there, and I got lunch. That was the 
biggest bunch of garb ag e I ever had in my  -- so who do you trust? 
Q: Yeah. So metimes it™s hard for me to 
understand, though, how 
you could go through 
what you went through and still have a sense of humor. 
A: Well, I don™t know, but there was -- there was a lot of jokes during th e war.  
Q: Yeah? 

A: There was a Jewish  woman, and she was 
cursing all day long, Hitler, then -- I hope 
you burn, I hope you drop dead
, I hope this, I hope that, 
and contin uously . So people 
say, ﬁWhy do you do th at?ﬂ She says, ﬁIt™s al
ways a mo ment when it comes true, and I 
don™t want to miss it.ﬂ 

Q: Yeah. I™ve her -- I™d like to ask you about
 when  you came to the States, and you -- 
it was a Jewish organization that helped 
you get settled here. So
 I™m assuming that 
right away  you had a chance to become
 part of a Jewish community here.

A: Y-Yeah, well -- 
Q: Yeah. And I™m -- I™m wondering if you  ever experienced a situation where 
American Jews didn™t understa
nd what you™ve been through. 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: What was that like? 
A: I-I don™t know, you didn™t like it, but they
 didn™t -- first they didn™t be -- some of 
them didn™t believe. Other say well, what™s th
e big deal, a lot of people had trouble, 
Irish and Du tch, why I had to make a blow
 up about it. And well, you had to -- you 
had to understand that people rel -- regardle
ss of religions, they
 grew up in this 
society. They even have Jews which are 
anti-Semites. I have a neighbor wh ich is 
black, he hate niggers. I mean, he said they 
all crooked [indecipherab le] so a -- a lot of 
people got their own opinions, 
they grew up in th
is environment, so when  they  -- why 
should they feel different th
an th e next who is a Christian, unless they had some kind 
of education in that area? Those -- like we
 had a Yom HaShoah -- you know what that 
is? 

Q: Yes. A Remembrance day. 
A: One of the Jewish fellas didn™t -- didn™t 
show up. I mean, acquain tances say, well 
where were you last night? Oh, I don™t be
lieve in that stuff. And he was also a 
newcomer. He says people get 
killed here and there, why are the Jews making so much 
fuss about it, you know? So th e 
people don™t understand that they grew up in  different 
environments, it™s just that be
ing Jewish is a religion, you 
might not even practice it. A 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
51
-- a lot of people don™t come to any events, a
nd so  just being Jewish doesn™t mean that 
you know ev erything, or you got the same
 outlook like the other Jews, you know, 
there™s just a difference in people. 
Q: Mm-hm, yeah. 

A: You know, people -- was a amian lady -- you -- you know Armenia -- 
Q: Yes, yeah. 
A: -- was taken away from Russians. Betwee
n the Turk s and th e Russians, they did 
away with it. There™s a Armenian woman wo
rking in a thrift store here. You know, 
when they first come, 
they get the minor jobs, then th
ey  go -- and -- and we met a guy 
from Russia which is Jewish, he™s a Russian. 
So, it just a mentality
. I was -- I stop now 
and then in thrift stores,  
some might pick up an tique or 
something, so this Russians -- 
Russian walked in, so 
I said to the Armenian, which sh
e -- I said is -- one of your 
friends is a Russian. She said, ﬁHe™s not 
a Russian, he™s a Jew.ﬂ So what no -- no 
matter what you do, you™re a Jew. You™re 
not American, you™re not a -- I had that 

happen, one day wh en I wa
s in a automo
tive shop -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- and the guy said hey -- he™s also a Pol
ack. So he said, ﬁHe™s 
not a Po lack, he™s a 
Jew.ﬂ So wh-what you gonna do
? There -- there was a joke with this, you hear that 
one? Wh ere that drunk was in the -- and -- on 
the train, and he keep s saying that he 
hate Jews. So this Jewish fellow was sitting th
ere, ﬁAnd I hate drunks.ﬂ So finally the 
drunk got laughing, and he says, ﬁWh-Wh
y are you laughing?ﬂ He said, ﬁI™m 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
52
laughing, I™ll be sober tomorrow, but you™
ll still be a Jew.ﬂ So you -- you -- don™t 
make any difference, Hitler fi
nd out you great, great, great 
father has Jewish wife, so 
right away  you -- you a Jew, you know wh at 
I mean? So what are you gonna do about 
it? 

Q: Right, right. 
A: If you -- if you co nvert to Catholic, you know
 wh at they say? He™s a converted Jew.  
Q: Right. I just -- I want to ask you if ther
e™s -- if there™s anythi
ng you want to talk 
about, any subject that I di
dn™t bring up, that you thi
nk is important for you to  
mention? Some -- something about your expe
rience, or your attit
udes, or anything? 
A: Well, I -- I really don™t know, you kind of
 exhaust the -- all the 
territory about the -- 
there™s not much I can say. There wa
s a lot of incidents during the war. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Like I told you about when 
I was trying to commit suicide. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And there was other incidents. There wa
s a couple things wh ich I never understood, 
and this is a little spooky. I was dreaming a 
couple people in front
 of a bridge. Next 
day we were marching to Theresienstadt, a
nd I see those two people, just like I had a 
dream exactly -- I don™t know what it mean
s. A couple times I had a dream and the 
next day it kind of come -- come  by me, just
 -- and I never understood how this come 
about, that you know ah ead of
 time. So we™re telling here one time that a couple, all of 
sudden th e guy got up at night, 
turned to his wife to come 
on. And they got in the car 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
53
and went driving. Their kids got a accident
 somewhere miles away
. Now this lady over 
there, we were resting on th e bed upstairs,
 which we cannot se
e what™s going on. All 
of a sudden there™s a knock on the door, 
and she says, ﬁDid you break your arm?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁWhat in the hell are you talking abou
t?ﬂ She ran down and 
opened the door, and 
my son walks in like that, he fell o ff th
e bicycle. And th at™s a true story. 
Q: Yeah, she told me that story. 
A: She to ld you? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know how. 
Q: Let me ask you  a broade
r question. [indecipherable] 
A: I -- I know th at your question didn™t have
 nothing to do with that answer, but I 
didn™t know how to  get around to it, yo
u just about ex hausted the whole thing. 
Q: Is it po-possible for you to -- after all thes
e years it™s -- to come
 to grips with what 
happened to you, to understa
nd it in any way that -- that
 you can explain to other 
people? 

A: Ah, I un -- I understand your question, but 
what can I explain. I would talk about it 
all the time there should be tolerance,
 understanding, an d [indecipherable] not 
everybody so perfect to be 
Mo ther Theresa, you know? 
Q: Do you think that
 it could happen again, on that scale? 
A: Do y-you remember what Santiana said, 
if you forg et your past [indecipherab le] 
will repeat itself. I -- I think 
that in the small scale, it™s 
h appening every day, because 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
54
if you look at the Africa, so
me European countries, Asia, 
there™s a h o locaust against a 
lot of people. So it™s not on the scale 
it was in Wo rld War Two, but things are 
happening, and if -- if you don™t listen -- for 
example, we -- we tried to stop it like here 
they went to Iraq, and got Mr. Saddam Hu ssein  Mr. Saddam Hu ssein would do like 
Hitler do, occupy lot of countr
ies, he probably holocaust a 
lot of -- a lot of people. I 
don™t know, they -- they -- I cannot come to
 detail, but they -- they -- he pois --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Boleslaw Brodecki. This is tape numb
er three, side A. Yo
u were talking about 
Saddam Hussein. 
A: Yeah, well i-i-if -- if he wouldn™t be st
opped, just like Blair 
said, the English prime 
minister, he say if we went on the wr
ong in formation about the weapons of mass 
destructions, and all, but there -- the future 
going to say that we did the right thing, 
because he was a villain. He was killing peopl
e, so we will be fo
rgiven for that. But 
that would be a holocau st if he -- he star
t with Ku wait, and goes Adurabi -- Abudabi, 
all those little countries. He probably kill 
millions of people. And so th e Holocaust 
didn -- didn™t end it. During the Ho locaust
 -- it™s just -- you got small holocau sts 
different places to different people. I don™t kn ow, there™s some American history, Billy 
Jack, and all that stuff was going on over here
. That wasn™t very 
pretty, either, so -- 
Q: What -- what Ame-- American history? 
A: You know, like you got the Indians. 

Q: Right, right. Yup. 
A: Like I see old American movies, and I se
e the sign in front of a -- a -- a restaurant 
that say, dogs and I-Irish are not allowed, 
you know? They didn™t discriminate against 
Chinese, who build the railroa
d from New York to Californi
a. I mean, you know, so -- 
Q: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
56
A: They™re still in -- people, and it de
pends how many good pe
ople, how many bad 
people, the good people win, or the bad peop
le win. You know? And if the bad people 
take over, you got another Holo
caust, you know what I mean? 
Q: Yeah, I do, I do. 
A: Even in your country -- it™s 
in Serbia over there, they 
were slaughtering people in a 
-- 

Q: Yeah. It™s hard to s -- having -- being 
a surv ivor, wh at do you think th at -- ho-how 
do you see the world as a result of that, a
nd how does it -- how has it affected your life 
since the liberation? 
A: Well, first of all, I™m glad I™m in 
United States. Democracy
, you know. You can 
say things here where other 
countries you go to jail. You 
know what I mean? There™s 
freedom, and a lot of people take advant
age of the freedom. But in the -- y-y-you 
cannot take away the rights from people. Wh
ere they got that here, anti-demafa -- 
Defamation League? No one -- they might 
def -- defend Nazis and everything else 
because a free country. But a -- I think thi
ngs are getting better, and I think United 
States stopped the Nazis, and Saddam 
Hu ssein, and -- and -- and they™re in 
Afghanistan. Whatever the -- the reason was,
 they made the world better. Only thing I 
feel sorry for all those people get killed. 
She tell you I go twice [indecipherable] to -- 
A2: Tell them it was your id ea. 

A: -- to -- to the war memori
al, and I put a wreath on it 
Q: Which war memorial? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
57
A: He-here -- here™s a war memorial, in -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- Richmond, World War Two, Wo rld War 
One, th ey got all the names all over, and 
I might be able to show you what I do, after the session.  
Q: And you put a mem -- you put a wreath 
at the memorial for 
the -- it™s for -- for 
combat, for veterans? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because I feel bad. 
Q: Yeah. You feel bad about what? 
A: I-I started off in
 Richmond -- so -- 
Q: No, th at™s okay. Will you -- I wanted you to
 finish that thought. You feel -- you do -
- why do you do that? Because you want to -- 

A: Because a -- a -- wh-when we came here, 
and I didn™t know if
 United States would 
intervene in Europe, I might never see the -- 
time of the day, I might have been dead. 
And all this, 50 - 60, or how many thousand 
American boys die, and I went to homes, 
fix the TV, and here™s a picture, on the top 
of TV of a G.I., and I say, ﬁWho is that?ﬂ 
ﬁWell, my -- my son, he go
t killed in Europe.ﬂ Or my 
father. And I figured they™re 
looking at me like, you know, I™m still alive,
 and those -- I -- I just felt bad that those 
people volunteer [indecipherable] sacrifice 
th eir lives for the freedom here, which the 
average people on the street don™t unders
tand that, that they owe somebody the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
58
liberties they get now. Like to
day they dying in Baghdad ev
ery day. So I just decided 
to take a part at remembran
ce. And when we finish that, 
I [indecipherable] the wreath, 
I got it at home. [indecipherable] 
Q: Okay. That™s great. I want to ask you 
one mo re thing about your son™s involvement 

at the Holocaust museum, a
nd what that means to you. 
A: Well, that means a lot. I mean, that 
he understand like h-he really got -- took 
interest in our family, then he went to Is
rael, and -- and he was a fundraiser that time, 
a-and he was in this house wh en they called 
him in, they couldn™t raise enough money 
for the mu seum. He was awarded a United St
ates -- so he went
 to work for the 
mu seum, and it was very difficult, but he says
 he wouldn™t quit, or trust anybody with  
the job. And a -- and a woman who was dyin
g, who want the mu seum to survive was 
Mr. Meyerhoff from Philadelphia, he put si
x million dollars for the museum. And he 
did it for his wife, I think sh  -- I don™t know
 if she was a newcomer, and he called Joe 
here, and Jo e took the job. And he finish
ed the job, he was -- you™re going to  see a 
Wallenberg there -- oh, on 14th Street, a
nd in front, Joseph Michael Brodecki, 
National Camp aign director. But what happened 
after Clinton was elected, a lot of jobs 
were appoin ted by the gove
rnment, see? The people wh
o started the museum, they 
were out, th ey ap point other people. You k
now, which were democrats, I think. But 
anyway, he finish his job, so 
he went to work for Apec, th at™s where he got the picture 
with the Jewish president. 
But he stay there for about 
a year, but he didn™t like, 
because he said it was aff
ected by local politics, like de
mocrats, or republicans. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070
 
 
 
59
Q: Oh su re. 
A: And that was above helping Israel and oh
 -- so then finally he quit that, but he™s 
now with  the st -- brokerage comp any in -- in Washington.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I think he started off, it™s just a big, bi
g, big comp any. They  never advertise. So 
that™s the story. 

Q: So th ere™s a Brodecki name right on the front of the mu seum. 

A: Yeah, you gonna see the [indecipherable]
 I don™t think they took it off, because 
that™s the original people -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It™s Joseph Michael Brodecki
, National Camp aign Director.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: He was going all over the country, every 
time he called me, I says, ﬁWhere you at?ﬂ 
ﬁWell, I™m San Fran cisco.ﬂ ﬁWhere you at?ﬂ
 ﬁI™m Los Angeles.ﬂ I mean, he was gone 
24 hours a day. 
Q: Mm. Tough job, yeah. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Well thank you,
 thanks a lot. 
A: You™re welcome.

ust Memorial Museum interview with Bod
