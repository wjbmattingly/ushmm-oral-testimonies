A: My mother and father were both born In 
Pabianice
, Poland. My father left Germany, no I™m 
sorry. He left  Poland at a very young age to evade 
the Russian slash Polish army, service in the 
army.  And he came to Ha mburg. To establish 
business and ma ke a living.  And several years 
later he had, he already knew my
 mother.  They ma rried in Danzig which was then free.  It 
didn™t, it was didn™t belong to any country.  It
 was a not a free port, I would say but the 
equivalent of that so they were able to ma rry
 there. And then settle in Hamburg, Germany.  

Married in 1924.

mb urg?  What was the Hamburg of your youth? 
 

A: We  had a very pleasant life.  My fa ther wa
s a business ma n. He had established himself early 
on.  He was relatively successful.  My mother an
d father both employed household help.  As well 
as my father had office help.  We  lived comfor
table, mi ddle class, ma ybe a little upper mi ddle 
class life.  My mother obviously didn™t work. 
She was a very cultured lady who had studied

music in her youth. She played the piano beautifully 
and to say that she fill
ed my life , our life, 
our home wi th beautiful music. She, and my fath
er loved going out.  They loved the opera, they 
loved concerts.  They had ma ny friends and father
 played cards and my mother had as I said 
before household help.  She did enjoy cooking bu
t she also every afternoon took her nap.  And 
we had to be very quiet if we were home . 
 

Q: Can you tell me  your parents™ name s?

Kleinert

rs or sisters? 
 
A: I have a sister, Ruth.  Horowitz. 
 

Q: Who™s older? 

 

A: I am.  

 

Q: What kinds of things did the two 
of you do when you were children for fun? 

 

A: We  went to the theater, we went to the circus
. We went to concerts.  Being the older one and 
being in a slightly at that, fo
r that time anyway age group, I had a lot of friends. I was in a 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 4 
 
gymnastic club called Bar 
Kochba.
  I went to parties, birthday 
parties and I had a lot of fun. 
Every summer, we went to Poland.  My mother a
nd sister and I. My fa
ther could not go.  And 
we™ll probably get into 
that. So I had actually two sets of 
friends. I had my  grandparents and a 
large family in 
Pabianice
.  And my grandfather at time s would 
rent  a place in the country.  This 
was in Poland. And oh I also went to camp in Ge
rmany as a younger person. So yes it was a very 
nice childhood up to a point.  
 

Q:  Let me  a s k you a few things about what you™ve
 already just told me .  You said your father 
was a business man, but you didn™t te
ll me  what kind of business. 
 

A: He was in the what we would call here
 dry goods. He was also a ma nufacturer™s 
representative.  He sold suspe
nders and garters for openers. He  
also sold children™s clothing.  
Many things that are considered here dry goods. 
I would have to list too ma ny things.  And he 
was a ma nufacturer™s repr esentative. 

 

Q:  And you me ntioned that you would go and have
 summers in Poland with relatives.  Can you 
give me  the name s of the relatives. 

 

A: Ok we would say with
 my mother™s parent s, 
Sa c k a
 and Marcus 
Kleinert
. Those are my 
ma ternal grandparents. He  was a dentist, my grandfather and they had a large home and where he 

also had his practice.  Then I had my patern
al grandparents although my
 paternal grandfather 
died early on  But my grandmother 
Salzberg
 lived and I loved going to her house, more religious 
than my ma t e rnal grandparents.  And I don™t want 
to get ahead of anything.
  And with her lived 

Interview with JuttaLevy

with my paternal grandmother 
lived my father™s sister  w
ho was widowed early on and her 
daughter. And I loved going there, especially on 
Shabbat
.  Because her house was smelled of 
fresh 
challah
 and chicken soup and my aunt 
Henya
, my fat her™s sister was the funniest person 
that I have ever me t.  And 
ma de me  laugh a whole lot.  
 
Q: What languages were spoken in your home?  

 

A: German.  And my parents if they didn™t wa
nt us to understand, Polish.  Although the primary 
language, even for my fa ther was German. 

 

Q: When you went to visit relativ
es in Poland what did you speak? 
 

A: I spoke German and they spoke German bac k 
to me . My grandmother, paternal grandmother 
spoke Yiddish which if I understood it was all ri
ght and if I didn™t understand it my aunt, her 
daughter would explain but it was primarily 
German.  I unde rstood some  Polish although 
because they, if they spoke Polis
h there were things I coul d pick
 up  and out, but I did not speak 
the language.  

 

Q: During your childhood, did you ever reflect about 
how the life of the fa mily was different in 
Poland than it was in Germany? 

 

A:  I really don™t™ think so because my maternal
 gr andparents were very comfortable. I liked the 
city of 
Pavlenitsa
.  I really did.  It wa s smaller, but then
 Hamburg wasn™t what 
it is today either.  

Interview with JuttaLevy
 6 
 
No, I have to say no that I didn™t™ reflect. It wa
s, it was different. My grandmother my paternal 
grandmother lived a simpler life.
 In a different section of 
Pabianice
, but it was still it was nice. It 
was nice. I should say though that my grandmother 
Salzberg
 I do reme mb er when I was very, 
very young we used to have facilities  on the 
outside.  I did not have that at my other 
grandparents™ house. But that changed relativel
y early on. But I do reme mber that.  But then 
again we always went in the summe r  so
 that was not a terrible hardship.  
 

Q: You me ntioned that you went 
with your mother and 
your sister but your 
father couldn™t come  
on those trips to Poland. Can you explain? 

 

A:  Very simply he had left, I don™t know if it wa
s surreptitiously but he 
left to a, to avoid 
serving in the army and he could not return ther
e.  He was stateless, 
r e nder ed st at el ess by t h e 
German government. Well, getting 
 a little ahead of it he was stat
eless because he was Jewish  
but that  came slightly later.  But he was 
never made, he never was a German citizen.  

 

Q:  I want to ask you some  more about Ham
bur g and your childhood.  You me ntioned that your 
different grandparents had differe
nt levels of religious observa
nce but in your home in Ha mburg 
what religious traditions did you observe? 

 

A: All the holidays.  Friday night. I want to 
say Saturday we knew it was the Shabbat. But we 
were not observant in the sense that the ort
hodox people are. We were 
not.  But yet we were, 
both my sister and I as we were raised that™s how
 we raised our children. The Sabbath with all its 
traditional things, the candles, the 
challah
, the wine, the 
boruchas
, it™s all part of our life. And 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 7 
 
has become  and we™ve carried that  on for our 
children. I speak for myse
lf.  I know both of my 
daughters. But we are not observant to the point
 of not riding on a Saturday or et cetera. 
 
Q: And that was what your 
fa mily observed even then? 
 

A:  Yes.  As a ma tter of fact my mother was 
raised the same  way.  She was not raised in a 
particularly religious ho
me .  My father, yes.  
 

Q: Wa s there a large Jewish
 community in Hamburg? 
 

A:  Yes.  Very large.  Extremel
y large. I didn™t™ even realize how 
large as a child.  Only it was in 
later years that after the end of 
the war and since I™ve been back th
at I realized just how large the 
community was.  Synagogues and a lot of Je
wish activity but we
™ll get into that. 
 

Q: What were relationships like between 
the Jews and the gentiles in Hamburg? 
 

A: We ™re talking about before the Nazis came in. 
 Good.  I had friends from early, early on that I 
can reme mb er that were definitely not Jewish. 
And they were good friends. I mi ght, excuse me . I 
mi ght add my parents also my father was in a ca
rd game  that was primarily non-Jews.  So he was 
a businessman. As other businessman, as other businessman, the ultima te business ma n. He 

associated with and was personable I mi ght add 
and associated with people that he liked got 
along with and did business with.   

 

Interview with JuttaLevy

Q:  Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young child in Hamburg?  
 

A: After the, soon afte
r the Nazis came .   
 

Q: But before the Nazis came? 

 

A:  Not that I was aware of.   

 

Q: When you went to school, you started at ki
ndergarten, elementary.  Did you go to public 

school or private school. 

 

A: I went to, I started out in public school. Yeah public school to begin with unh hunh. 

 
Q:  And then what happened. 
 

A: We ll since you know how old I 
am, I started school in 1932.  31, 32, when I was about five, 
five and a half years old.  And it was fine. We  
learned, we had fun.  And 
i t  didn™t last very long 
because as you know in 1933 the Nazis came into power. And how I happened to be very, 

become very much aware of that
 is because of something that 
happened to me   in public school. 
If you™d like I can tell it to you. I went to school 
one day as I always di
d and was called out of 
class. And there was, I was called into an o
ffice of a very quote unquote nice  lady and she had a 
conversation with me  and asked me  ma ny que
stions about my mother and father and 
grandparents, my aunts, my uncles. It didn™t™ ma
tter where they were.  And what who my parents 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 9 
 
associated with and who their friends were, who my
 friends were  and but primarily about family 
things and where they were and what we did and th
is was all as far back she asked me  as I could 
reme mber.  And at that time I still had a great 
grandfather, my  maternal grandmother™s father 
was still living whom I was very fond of. So th
ey dug into the back, my background as far back 
as a child of six, seven years old could reme mb
er. And when I came home and told my parents 
about this, they were furious. And it wasn™t too 
long after that that my parents put me  into a 
private school for Jewish girls. And my and th
at coincides with the time that I wasn™t even 
welcomed in public school anymore. What this 
was about, this interview was called in German, 
I™ll give you the German wo
rd for it.  It™s called 
Ra ze n unda zuhom
. Literally translated means 
race research.  Race, race re
search is what it means.  
 
Q: You said your parents were furious. Did they
 explain to you why they were so angered? 
 
A: I think so. To the best of my knowledge my
 fat her especially was very vocal about it.  
Because he felt at that time that it was a heck of
 a lot of nerve for these people to take, get hold 
of a young person like myself and dig into their bac
kground. I have to tell you 
that at the time , at 
the time , I wasn™t aware. I was curious why. A
nd I also knew that not everybody had this.  And 
you know kids are very tuned into other kids and ot
her kids knew that I we nt for this interview, 
but not everybody did.   So already there was 
a line drawn. But it wa
sn™t as obvious, as 
horrendous to me  as it certainly was to 
my father.  Specially my father.   
 

Q: Do you reme mber the campaign that Hitler wa ge
d to get himself into political a position of 
political influence. Do you reme mbe r  the election campaign. 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 10 
 
 
A: Well what I remember primarily is a ma
n would get on televisi
on and he would not on 
television. I™m sorry I™m way ahead of hi m. Wow, thank god there was 
no television then. Who 
knows what dama ge he could have done.   My fath
er was a, like listening 
to the radio and I did 
too. But when this person came on, I never understood what he was talking about because this 

ma n screa med and yelled. And although I was very 
proficient in German and spoke what is now 
called 
Hochdeutsch
. They don™t™ even have that anymore.
  They speak one level of German.  
And I also wrote in this 
different script which is 
Hochdeutsch. 
 
Q: Can you translate
 Hochdeutsch?
 
 
A: High German.  High German. An
d yet I did not understand this
 person. If you listen to his 
speeches today on tape or  in the movie, movies that we have and when I say we, I™m talking 
about the museum. Anyway historians have.  
Who understands what he™s screaming about?  I 
certainly did not.  I will say this
, that I could see my father a
nd mother and friends. As I said 
before they had friends.  Lots 
of friends. Being upset about it. 
 And talking you know how is this 
all going to, what is he saying. Or why is he sa
ying these things about an Aryan race and all the 
other things.  Although he promised to ma ke thin
gs better economi cally and that was what my 
father explained to us, to me . 
His real mi ssion Hitler™s mi ssion wa
s to ma ke things financially, 
economically better at the expense of
 who knows. Who knew at that time . 
 
Q:  Do you reme mber Hitler being sworn in as Chancellor? 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 11 
 
A: I believe they had it on the radi o.  I believe we
 were told that in school
 because I was still in 
public school. I believe that they talked about it
 because immediately the pictur es went  up on the 
walls of the school with him in his now infa mous
 salute. Yeah. I don™t know
 that I exactly heard 
or understood or grasped the concept.  Ca
n I tell you that I saw this ma n?    
 
Q: I was going to ask you that.   

 

A: When I was still in public school we went 
on a field, what™s called a field trip. He was in 
Ha mburg and we had to go downtown and see Hitler.  And although it was from a distance, 

reme mber I was a small person then. So I craned my
 neck and yes I got to see him and we had to 
give the what is now the infamous Heil Hitler sa
lute. I will tell you, I was not comfort a ble with 
that. And I didn™t really quite 
know yet why I wasn™t. But I wasn
™t. Probably what I heard at 
home . You know that from the speeches that he
 had ma de and listening 
to the grown-ups talk. 
But I did see him and he ard him.  I didn™t, I no 
more understood him then I did when I heard him 
on the radio. But yes I did 
see this infamous man. 
 

Q: What kind of i mpression did he ma ke on you in person? 

 

A: Being not, not that close to him. Well I 
already had preconceived 
impression. Having heard 
him on the radio and having heard my parents an
d their acquaintances talk so I think ma ybe 
that™s why I was uncomfortable but 
I had to do it, give the salute. 
I mi ght add I had to give that 
salute every morning once he came into power. 
As we pledge allegian
ce in school, in this 
country, to our flag, we had to give, I mean 
with every other word it was He il Hitler. Never 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 12 
 
comfortable with it and fortunately
 I didn™t have to do it for very
 long because they didn™t want 
me  and we didn™t want them in school.  
 

Q: You were still going back and forth to Po
land over the summers, during this time  period. I 
want to ask you to walk me  through some  of 
the changes that you mi ght have noticed among 
neighbors and friends in the early days of Hitle
r™s chancellorship. What stands out in your mi nd 
about that time?  

 

A: I had two very good friends, a bo
y that lived in our building, same
 building that I went to visit 
when I went back two years ago. And of a girlfriend. Her name is 
Ingeborg
. I have, I reme mber 
her.  The boy and I was a bit of
 a tomboy, this particular boy a
nd his friends, but I™m focusing on 
him because he was, lived in the building. He joined very early on as a very young kid  the Hitler 

Youth and from that mo ment on I became an outcast.  For several years he tormented us with 
bad language, throwing stones, kicking us and as 
he got older, of course it got worse. He 
some how disappeared. I don™t know if they move
d or what happened. I,
 I really don™t know.  
The, this girl friend of mine from very early on, 
they didn™t live that close to us but her parents 
and my parents were also friends.  And I do reme mber their last name . It was 
Vall
.  They my 
parents stopped being friends with them.  Or they 
with us and I never saw her again either.  So it 
was almost abrupt because they didn™t live near
 me .  Whereas some  of these other kids did. 

 

Q: Did you start experiencing 
any direct anti-Semitism.  
 

A: Early on.   

Interview with JuttaLevy
 13 
 
 
Q: Tell me about some of
 these early experiences. 
 

A: As I said you didn™t have to know the peopl
e, the youngsters. Mainly young people. My age, 
older.  You walked around with a nervous st
omach and you saw kids that were not, that you 
knew were not Jewish kids.  Because we were te
ased.  We  were ma de fun of. We  were called 
bad name s.  They had nobody to answer to. In ot
her words, this was the accepted thing.  You felt 
fortunate if they left you alone
. And I™m not going to tell you that they, many times when I say 
they, I™m talking different kids, different from di
fferent areas.  Don™t™ forget I had to use public 
transportation to go to school, once 
I started private school. So you 
felt fortunate if you didn™t get 
picked on and ma de fun of and tugged at and pulle
d at and ki cked.  And I will say this, I fought 
back too. Yes I did.  And but that didn™t ma tter. I was very young. 

 
Q: How did you fight back? 
 

A: I hit back. I hit. 

 

Q: what advice did your pa
rents give you on handling these kinds of situations. 
 

A: Not too much.  You know we didn™t talk abou
t it all that much, even though we all knew what 
was going on.  We  and they knew what, were they not
 going to send us to school. It wasn™t like 
an every mi nute type of thing.  Though not isolate
d, it wasn™t every mi nute. It was to begin with 
tolerable and then of course little by little it b
ecame  intolerable, living under that regime  for over 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 14 
 
six years.  So we experienced ma ny things and le
arned to deal with some . Be angered by others.  
Fight back a little bit if you could. 
 And it ma de for a little bit of 
a tough life. It wasn™t  pleasant 
and nice life that I was used to. 
Also I have to tell you, some  of 
this other than kids in the 
immediate circle of fr iends, some of this was a littl
e more gradual.  Little more gradual.  So that 
it not everybody pounced it, on you at the same  time. 
 And there were rest periods.  But then of 
course in the last two years 
there, it became intolerable. 
 

Q: I asked you a mo ment ago if you were still 
going to Poland over the summers. Did you notice 
anti-Semitism in Poland on those summer visits. 

 

A: No because it was, things were very isolated visits as far as visiting fami ly is concerne d, 

going to the country. I have to sa
y that I did not.  They ma y ha
ve been. I heard conversations you 
know that they set, you know 
my grandparents used to say 
you know this person was you know 
not friendly toward Jews. But especially my gra
ndfather. He was in a si
tuation where he was a 
professional ma n.  People came to him to get rid of 
a tooth, get rid of pain, to get a filling, to get 
a tooth pulled. They were more than grateful
 if you took care of them. And he was also 
some what educated in medicine. So they came to
 him actually for more than just the dental 
work. And I would say that 60% of his patients we
re not Jewish.  But very grateful that he took 

care of them, because I us ed to  sit there and watch him work.                                                                 
                
 

Q: I had aske d you about Hamburg in 1933 when 
Hitler was sworn in as
 chancellor.  Do you 
reme mber some  of the things that started to happ
en right after Hitler came into office. Like the 
burning of the Reichstag and emergency 
powers. Do you reme mber those events. 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 15 
 
 
A: No, not really, not really.  I 
reme mber life starting to change but
 that was very subtle as I™ve 
said before, primarily amongst the young children. A
nd this is, it was sub
tle. Mainly I heard it 
through my father who was a very much into th
e politics of the day a
nd the conversations, et 
cetera.  But other than experiencing the anti, what
 we now call, what was then called to the anti-
Se mitism  or the anti-Jewish situation.  Specific events like what you just  asked me  about the, no 

I, I have to say that I don™t™ reme
mbe r . I have to really dig down. 
 

Q: Do you reme mber  the boycotts of Jewish businesses.   

 

A: Yeah , I mean my fat her was a victim of that.  
defi nitely a victim of that.  But it took a while.  
I mean he, it was not subtle but he lost custom
ers.  Cause they wouldn™t™ buy from him. They 
would initially say you don™t need 
anything this trip around cause he 
also traveled. It didn™t  start 
to affect his livelihood un
til it ceased. It did totall
y cease. For the last year I would say not more 
that he was in business.  And 
he also represented a company.  
He was a manufacturers rep. Who 
had to break up their relationship wi th him. But 
I mi ght add they also wrote him a reference if 
you ever need it. That was very nice of them. 

 

Q:  Do you reme mber the book burning. 

 

A: Well we saw some of it.   In Hamburg mo
st of it was done synagogues.  Our synagogue.  You 

know it™s some thing that when you™re young, that young, and you become  aware of some  of 

these things that you™re asking me  about, specif
ically the book burning. At
 first, no ma tter how 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 16 
 
ma ny ti me s some body e xplains it to you whether it be
 teacher or parent, it™s some thing ma ybe 
you can, people can even relate to that  here
. You don™t understand.     You don™t understand it.  
Why?   Why get books together and burn them. They explained to us that they meaning the 
regime  of the day didn™t believe. They believed 
in burning the books that taught.  Huma nitarian 
things.  Great writers that have
 terrific influence on, on everybody™
s life, that if it didn™t™ ma tch 
up with their beliefs it was some thing that had to
 be gotten rid of. But yo
u go try to explain that 
to a ten year old kid. It™s, it™s hard
 to swallow that. It is hard to
 swallow. Burning books.  I, I™m 
an old woman now and I have a 
hard time comp rehending that.   
 

Q: Imagine that you saw some  book burning. Can 
you tell me , can you describe what you saw? 
 

A: A bunch of frenzied Nazis have a pile of book
s that they™ve collected fr om around. I watched 
this out of our home in, from the balcony. This was 
a small, relatively small.  This wasn™t one of 
these big, big bonfires. They collected books. I 
don™t even know where they got them from, 
probably out of people™s home s or
 stores or neighborhood synagogues.
 I have no idea where they 
got them fr om. And they built like a fi re. These we
re the uniformed brown shirt Nazi s, a lot of 

them young. The youth gr oups, the youth groups.  Hitler Youth. Which you have heard a lot 

about. And they would light them up and set them 
on fire and go nuts.  And, and absolutely think 
they were listening to a rock 
concert. That™s the only thi
ng I can you know they™d go crazy.  
They were frenzied.  

 

Q: I™m going to pause now and flip the tape. 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 17 
 
Q: This is tape 1, side B, we are intervie
wing Jutta Levy and you were
 telling about the book 
burning and I wanted to ask you about any re
collection you mi ght have about President 
Hindenburg. Do you remember when he died? 
 

A: I reme mb er when he died and the publicity su
rrounding it and I haven™t ta
lked about this in a 
long, long time.  So I™m not going to say too much 
about it because I just
, I right this second. I 
know there was a lot of publicity 
about it and I want to say and 
I ma y be wrong but I think there 
was a certain amount of sadness within
 Germany that he died.  But that
 I really that™s all.  I want 
to comment on that.  

 

Q:  You me ntioned publicity. Did you see a lo
t of anti-Semitic public
ity in those years. 
 

A:  We ll they had lots of posters, store fronts were ma rked.  
Juden
, which of course means Jew.  
Saw that pretty early on.  I mi ght also add that I 
would say that even prior to Hitler, ma ybe just 
prior, just after he came in.  There were the 
ma kings, not even the ma kings, it was a natural but 
for a certain element of people to persecute or  
be anti-Semitic, as it is ever ywhere. Desecration 
of a synagogue, desecration of a store front, name  
calling.  You know I, I want to say that also 
was part of norma l life. It didn™t necessarily 
all begin with this ma niac. But of course it 
intensified. We have listen we have some  of that
 in any country.  And I mi ght add in Poland too. 
But you know you don™t dwell on it.  It happens. It™s
 over with, except where I grew up, it wasn™t 

over with.  But it does happen and life goes on.   

Interview with JuttaLevy
 18 
 
 
Q:  You me ntioned you saw posters.  Can you desc
ribe some  of the things that you saw as a 
child. 

 

A: Primarily posters of Hitler™s with the salute. We™ve all seen those posters, pi ctur es, pictur es of 

SS me n because they we re the elite. Posters like that.  Post ers extoling 
Me in Kampf
 now. Not 
the book necessarily but that again is in connect
ion with Hitler. I didn™
t know too much about 
Mein Kampf
 then, his book but that™s what I reme mber
 seeing because they were up and around 
and especially when I still went to public school
. I knew when he was sworn in those things were 
up in, within the school. And also
 throughout the city. Not everywhere but I would venture to say 
in the theaters and wherever 
you went.  Restaurants.   

 

Q:  You me ntioned posters in the context of 
anti-Semitism. Do you remember seeing any anti-
Semitic posters. 

 

A: I saw some  but pri marily I reme mber vividly 
my father showing us, showing me  a newspaper 
that was ca lled 
Der Spiegel
 which I think is still in business. It™s   
Spiegel
 is mi rror, the mi rror.    
And they always depicted Jewish people with being very home ly with a hooked nose and 

pockmarked nose. I remember seeing a lot of that 
in the paper and in posters.          
 

Q: Do you reme mber the enactme nt of the Nurem
burg laws, either as a specific act or even do 
you have a sense of what the impact of these laws was on your fa mily. 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 19 
 
A:  We ll ma ybe not directly but 
certainly indirectly.  Not knowi
ng as a child what all, what 
impact it had at the mome nt or was  going to have 
but I certainly became awar
e of it very quickly.  
Now you ne ed to ask me  specific questions because
 otherwise I™m going to be lost and go on and 
on.                                                                                                                            
   
 

Q: About the racial laws and the inte
rmarriage and all t
hose classifications. 
 

A: Not just racial, not just inter ma rriage and et 
cetera, but also people th
at changed their religion 
from Jewish to whatever. It didn™t ma tter. It di
d not ma tter. A person was st
ill cl assi fied as a Je w 
not clean for lack of a different expression. Jews 
were responsible for all the bad things.  Jews 
were not Aryan. They were not of a pure race.  
Jews were needed to be exterminated. Jews 
needed to be exterminated.                                                                                                     
                                   
 
Q: We re you aware of the existence 
of concentration camps in the 30s? 
 
A: The only one that I personally 
was aware of was because  my fa
ther mentioned it as early as 
when I say 1933, that™s when this particular 
camp came into existence almost simultaneously 
with Hitler. But we, I have to be
 honest. The me dia and the infor ma
tion that trickled back is not 
like today. Today a person sneezes at one end of th
e world and it™s pi cked up at the other end of 
the world. Those were not days of great commun
ication but my father did know about a camp by 
the name  of Dachau which has become  infa
mous. And but you didn™t 
really understand. We  
knew we thought it was a prison camp. We  didn™t know
 all the horrible things that were going on 
there at that time.  At that time.  Had we known 
more I think we would have gotten out earlier, or 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 20 
 
tried, excuse me , tried to get out earlier. Because 
we got out as we were getting to by the skin of 
our teeth.   
 

Q: I™d like to go over a few more historical ev
ents and then ask you when the family ma de the 
move to get out.  Do you reme mber the 
Anschluss
? 
 

A: That™s when he went into Austria.  I did.  
Whe n you say do I reme mber it. It was part of what 
was going on that he ma rched very
 defi antly into Austria.   
 

Q: What was the reaction of your fa mily
 or the community to this event? 
 

A: Like with everything else. 
 There was a certain amount of, 
but I would not, certainly, there 
was apprehension.  No apathy but apprehension with 
this wi ll pass. Ok so he annexed or and, as 
you say 
Anschluss
 Austria. That™s one thing that he did. Don™
t™ forget it™s as far as it got at that 
time. 

 

Q: How was  that event reported in the me dia in Germany?  

 

A: I don™t have a whole lot of oh me mory of th
at but tremendous vict
ory. Wonderful. It was 
wonderful. They, they felt they always they gave
 us to understand and I™m only sort of repeating 
what I heard and was privy to.  That the Germ
ans always felt that Austria was Germany and 
Germany was Austria. It was like 
one.  And I mi ght also add that
 my mot her had some education 
in Austria, as well as her brother did and Aust
ria was the land of Stra
uss and waltzes and my 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 21 
 
mother lame nted you know the fact that Austria 
will probably never be as she had known it as a 
young person. That™s really what I reme mber mo
stly.  It did not ma ke the impact on me 
personally as a young person that it would had 
it happened ten years later in my age. 
 

Q:  During these events what was th
e Jewish community doing in Hamb urg? 
 

A:  Go, mos tly going on as best as they coul
d, as norma lly as they could with ma ny people 
ma king arrangeme nts, plans to leave. And others sa
ying it will, I mean this will pass, this can™t  

be happening. I ma y be getting ah
ead of it but people were starti
ng to talk about getting out.  
And some  left, some  people left as early on as
 1934, 35.  My father™s brother who would follow 
him to Ger many and they were in business togeth
er for a time  his younger brother.  He did not 
leave under the circumstances that my father did 
because he was able to return to Poland and 
visit. But he left in 1936 and that was supposed to
 be when we were offered well we™ll get into 
that I™m sure. But people started to leave. They di
dn™t want to put up with, well they were afraid. 
They were afraid. Some  people more afraid than
 others and also I mi ght say it™s a tremendous 
venture to pick up your family, your, your, your life 
and move it to wherever.  It™s a tremendous 
and especially when there are children. We  knew 
my aunt and uncle never had children so it™s 
not as traumatic. We  had another my parents ha
d friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to 
leave but they didn™t. They had no children. People 
with children, it was a little harder, it was a 
little harder to pick up. Imagine yourself having to
 totally leave. I mean for that time it, maybe 
today it isn™t. People are moving a
bout the whole world. In those days
 they, they left for political 
reasons like my father did but then he had establ
ished himself in, and was raising a family.  It™s 
not so easy but he started to thi
nk about it. As things progressed. 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 22 
 
 
Q: One last questions ab
out historical events and then I want
 to figure out where your family fit 
in.  The Evian Conference in 38.  What was the 
reaction as be st as you could tell and the Jews 
around you when they realized what had happened at
 that conference.  Or what was not going to 
happen because of the conference. 

 

A: We ll,  being again young not really understandi
ng the full impact of it, other than what I 
heard around me , they didn™t go in
to these things in school.  My
 I have to say my pe rsonal 
reaction is only what the vibe that I picked up from
 my  fa mi l y ,  my  fa t h e r  e s
pecially.  And that is 
the fear, fear.  And it™s not just from that conf
erence but from everyday li
ving is fear, fear that 
the average person in this count
ry just doesn™t understand. 
 

Q: Explain what you mean by every day fear on 
an everyday basis. What was happening every 
day that ma de you fearful. 

 

A:  Just going out. Having to sneak to school
. Did you ever hear of anybody having to sneak to 
school. In Ge rmany there are six school days. One 
of them is Saturday. I went to a religious 
school, a Jewish school .  One did not go to school
 on the Sa bbath but we had to get in six days 
of school. So we went on Sunday.  Well we had to
 sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I 
mean this is just one relatively small example,
  although not so small.  Carry instead of a book 
bag, a dress bag. Put a book in, lunch, no outside r
ecess, quietly. Again the 
word surreptitiously 
went to school. Also you never knew what wa
s going to happen to you on the outside. Is 

some body going to pick on you.  Is some body going 
throw stones at me .  Is some body going to 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 23 
 
hit me.  Is somebody call, going to call me dirty 
name s and then as things progressed they did 
come  into the schools, the SS people and very quietly
 and systematically escorted kids out of the 
school. Now I don™t know if you wa nt to hear this 
now or, or as you get on
 with the interview, 
but this is all part of it. So 
you live in fear because some body out there is out to pick on you.  For 
the lack of a better word. I think 
it™s more than just picking. Kids
 get picked on all the time. but 
this is a different kind of picking on. 
 

Q: When did your parents first 
think about getting out Germa ny. 
 

A: Well we were my father was offered to l
eave Germany in 1936 because he had one brother 
over here. But in 1936 he was still 
under the illusion that
 it would perhaps pass.  The other thing 
also was that some time a r ound that time  the uncle that we have here suggested that my  father 

come  by hi mself and leave my mother and his tw
o daughters to come  at a later time . And that 
was not acceptable to him.  I ma y have my dates 
a little muddled with that
.  But instead of he 
basically felt when that fi rst offer came , no I ha
ve a family. And my mother was totally against 
moving. How could she leave. Poland
 was not that far away. If sh
e came to let™s say the US she 
would never get to see her parents and her family ag
ain.  And this will pass
, this, this can™t last. 
People were in total I™m not going to
 say denial, but disbelief.  Deni
al is too strong as fa r as the 
way I understand deni al means they just felt it, this
 can™t last . It can™t last.  This will change.  

 

Q: What was the straw that broke 
the camel™s back for your parents? 
 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 24 
 
A: My uncle left in 36 or 37, 37. Before they ever
 left my fat her reali
zed that he had ma de a 
mi stake and that we also needed to leave a
nd what did that. Totally no livelihood, number one. 
Number two the Gestapo started hounding us. Nu
mber three people were disappearing, people 
that we knew were disappearing.  Ki ds were take
n out from school, as I 
me ntioned before, first 
very quietly, very nicely. And then not so nice. 
 We lived in a very nice apartment building. You 
heard knocks at the door in the mi ddle of the ni
ght. More people were taken away.  A few 
screams, screeches.  Everything you know it was horri
fic.  We  heard vi a my father and also via 
friends heard of people disappearing.  Oh they were
 sent to on a train to no ma n™s land which is 
out in the corridor. In fact that
™s the word I was looking for much 
earlier in the tape.  And in the 
winter time.  Because winter in Germany at th
at time ca me early on, sometimes on my birthday 
there was snow on the ground and I wa
s born very late in September. But they were sent out on a 
train and then chased off the train into no ma n™s 
land. And if they tried to come  back or plead 
they were shot. These things came back to us.  
Or they froze to death or got away. And these 
things got back to me , to my pare
nts and also to me . And by this 
time  I™m already a pre-teen-er.  
Pre-teen. And so beginning to understand.  But prim
arily for my father it was the total no job, no 
money comi ng in.  Being released from his repres
entation. And then his own business, what he 
did on you know hi ms elf was also nonexistent.  A
nd it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and 
threats and primarily people disappearing and wh
at they heard. And never to be heard from 
again. And also other people ma king plans to leav
e because Germany at the time that we™re now 
at was in a st ate of frenzy to rid itself of Je
ws. So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his 
wife Alice left, we already knew that we had to 
also ma ke plans. That™s when my father was 
offered the opportunity to come  alone and we would 
be sent for later on and he said no it™s all of 
us or none of us.  

Interview with JuttaLevy
 25 
 
 
Q: What was the deciding factor for your mother?  
When did she also accept that not to stay in 
Germany anymore. What was the last straw for her. 

 

A: When her husband said it™s ti
me  to ma ke plans to leave.  
 

Q: How did your fa mily ma nage wit
hout the income from the business? 
 

A: I never knew what my father had. In those 
days you don™t think about it.
  I imagine that he 
had money s a ved up.  He was not a rich ma n but he
 wasn™t penniless so we, he existed like that 
and you know he ma y on his own have done some
 business dissolving, getting rid of stock 
certainly with the company he was with becaus
e he was severed, but ma naged to get rid of 
whatever he had, and also was, well I™m getti
ng ahead of it again. You know we™re now talking 
about two years of before we left that he ha
d virtually no real income  to speak of but we 

maintained the apartment. We main
t a ined the help. He was able t
o, to do it. He never counted his 
money. I don™t know.   

 

Q: When did he lose the income . You said it wa
s two years before you left but can you give me  a 
year. 

 

A: I think that the, the comp
any that he was representing wa
s in 1936 slash 37. It wasn™t you 
know like this but, but also reme mbe r  before 
he was let go, people weren™t buying from hi m.  
Well when people aren™t buying fr
om you, you™re not generating the income  so I always say two 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 26 
 
years, two years because it ju
st ebbed away.  And people do
n™t buy, you don™t™ ma ke money, you 
don™t ma ke commissions and your income  ceases. 
 

Q: What did they do to try to get out? 

 

A: My father applied to well he first had to be 
get an affidavit from this uncle in Paterson New 
Jersey, Isaac 
Gothelf
.  He also needed to get this didn™t, 
none of this happens 
overnight. He also 
needed to get permission from the Germans to ge
t out, permission to leave.
  Might I add that all 
of us with the exception of my 
mother who had a Polish passport were stateless.  And I was, my 
sister, my fa ther obviously was. SO you start put
ting into motion plans to leave which isn™t like 
going to a consulate today, get a visa and off yo
u go.  It™s a lot of was a lot of work and 
persistence.  With the Germans defi nitely brib
ing them.  Making so called friends with them, 
well let™s not call it fr iends, but it™s br ibing them 
and he did that. He bribe
d, he lied.  He did he 
put every trick out of his bag th
at he could so that we would 
not be taken away. That didn™t 
guarantee it. Did not guarantee it so
 he put into motion to leave. 
 The affidavit from t he uncle 
finally came.  The permission from t he Germans 
finally came. But we didn™t have a visa from 

the US to come  and that™s where we almost 
didn™t ma ke it out because the Americans didn™t 
want to give us a visa. I hate to
 say that.  Sitting here in this 
beautiful country, 
but they didn™t. 
And he had booked passage already  for March of
 39 which was changed because of a boat was 
being painted. So he changed it December of 38. 
That also didn™t work out. The Aquitania so 

then he booked it for November 
of 38. With no proper papers.  A
nd my mother went, my mother, 
my sister and I went to Poland in October of 
38 which was a harrowing trip which is a story all 
unto itself to say goodbye to the parents, the grandpa
rents.  Aunts, uncles, cousins.  And when 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 27 
 
we came home my fathe r  said we™re leaving. We™re
 definitely leaving an
d that was within two 
weeks that we came back.  And my  mother said I can
™t leave.  My curtains are wet. I™m not this, 
I™m not that.  I™m not packed. I don™t have the thing. 
He said I™m sorry we have to leave. And we  
did.  But we didn™t™ have the visa  so on the Saturd
ay before we left  we still di dn™t have it.  We 
had pleaded, we had the way he was with the 
Germans because he couldn™t, didn™t bribe anybody 
at the American consulate. But he pleaded with 
them. He went every day 
practically.  No visa, 
Mr. Salzberg, it™s a quota it™s a th
is, it™s a that. Finally he went, 
took my mother, my sister Ruth 
and me  down to the consulate. He insisted
 on seeing some body. He was told nobody could see 
him. He says but you are going to see me , you are 
going to see us.  Some body has to see us. It 
was very dramatic, very compelling. There is no way 
that I can even  descri
be that scene at the 
American consulate in Ha mburg. There is no wa y.  
I can tell you about it 
and it™s ever going to 
ma ke the i mpact that it had on me  anyway and I™
m sure my s i ster and all of us, especially my 
father for the rest of our lives. 
 This ma n finally let us in and 
we were told time and time  again 
that you cannot have a visa today, the papers ar
e not ready blah, blah, blah.  We  were like up on 

the fifth or sixth floor and my 
father said I™ll tell you some thi
ng. With what™s going on we are 
leaving and if we are not leav
ing Germany we are going out that
 window. He starts pulling me , 
my mother and my sister over to
 the window.  We were going to jump. He meant it because he 
knew that our time was up. We  had so far been left
 pretty much alone.  As far as we weren™t™ 

dragged away in the mi ddle of the night like ma
ny of our neighbors, let alone friends were. 
People in school were. We were pretty much left 
alone.  But our time was, was up. So this fellow 
who was there, Mr. Davis knew that well Mr. Salz
berg meant business. And we did get the visa 
that day. And then the rest of it 
is all pretty dramatic too. We l e
ft.  Am I getting ahead of myself 
here. We  left a few days later. We  got to Col
ogne.  We  left an apartment with furniture. Some  

Interview with JuttaLevy
 28 
 
things we had, my mother had sent away in an
ticipation of leaving.  We
, we left. We  got to 
Cologne but we left the housekeeper there. Her name  was Frau 
Krug
 and we had a little parakeet 
that I entrusted to her. And all the 
bens
 and the furniture but the pa
ra k e e t  t o  me  w a s  my  mo s t  
important possession that I had to leave behind.  
We got to Poland the next morning. My father 
called her up. I was right there with him when he
 called and you could see hi
s face drain of color. 
She told him, we left at, the train left at mi
dnight. At 6 AM the following morning they came and 
they were furious, the Gestapo. These were the 
people in the black uniforms, the SS people came 
to take us away and when she told them that we had left they were furious. Absolutely furious. 
The destroyed our bedding. They destroyed our apar
tment, they trashed it.  Bayonetted my bird, 
bayoneted this tiny little bird 
and beat her to a pulp. She wa
s not a, see what she was doing 
anyway was illegal.  She was, she was not a Jewi
sh woma n. I have no idea what she was. But she 
had nowhere to go so you know for her my father 
said listen. Whatever is
 here is yours.  But 
what are you going to do with it. So she was inthe apartment and they didn™t™ believe her. They, 
they beat her and destroyed everything. And that
™s how we know when they came. We have no 
other way of know. How would we know but for her. 
 And we were very grat
eful to be where we 
were, but we were still in Germany.  If this we
re five years later with
 telecommunications being 
what they became, I don™t™ know that we would ha
ve ma de it out.  But we were in Germany and 
changed trains and came the next saga. 
 

Q: What did you take with you when you left your house? 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 29 
 
A: Me personally?  I took a doll.
 I took my autograph book which I 
still have and I took my diary 
and whatever my mother packed. That™s it. 
Some  pictures. That™s what I took, but mo st 
importantly my autograph book and my diary. 

 

Q: And then what happened to you after, the next step for your journey? 

 

A: We  had to get to Paris.  Then we came to 
the border in Aachen and the Germans ga ve us one 
last send off.  Took my father off the train as
 they came through to check
 the papers.  You don™t 
dare move in Europe.  There are compartments and from each compartment. Reme mber we were 

not the only ones  running. There were ma ny peop
le on the train, some  with no luggage but ma ny 
people like us.   But they took my father off 
the train and you don™t dare move. Every time we 
moved we had everything or my mother or anybo
dy that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed 
at you and he™s ready. Any excuse, any excuse so 
let me  see my father.  He™s talking and he™s 
very animated and we had no idea. All of a s
udden they say the train is going to mo ve and it 
started to, move, start to move along slowly and 
we™re hysterical.  There we
 are. My mother and 
two kids and no husband. He™s still talking to th
e Germans. Fi nally we saw hi m run and he got 
on the last what do they call it, the end of th
e train. The ma n was 40 years old, suffered from 
high blood pressure. That he didn
™t have a heart attack then 
wa s amazing. What did they want 
from  hi m. When he finally came  into the compartment and told us was they said he had too 
much mone y on him. So he said well then take 
it. We  don™t do that.  They didn™t™ offer him an 
alternative. He says well why can
™t you take it.  He says we ar
e honest, we are honest people. We 
don™t take money.  We ll he had to 
come  up with an alternative. He
 says well then I™ll send it to 
Ha mburg, to the housekeeper. Is that
 all right. at first they said no 
and then they said yes. But of 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 30 
 
course you know that she never got the money. 
And we™re not talking about a whole lot of 
money because he came out with next to nothi ng
.  That™s how, that was our goodbye and then 
once we crossed the border peopl
e started opening up.  You know on
ce we were sure there were 
no more Germans, now we™re in Holland, Belgium. 
 We ™re on our way to Paris. So we were very 
lucky. 
 

Q: What was the exact date you left Germany?  

 

A: We  left Ha mburg on Nove mber sixth going to 
the seventh of 1938, just about the last legal 
trai n. When I say legal, yeah legal. No
t too many people came out after that.   
 

Q: I™m going to pause now and change tape.

Esther Finder : This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial  Museum. Today™s date is 

September 15. This is a con
tinuation of the September 8
th
 interview with Jutta Levy.  This is tape 
2, side A. You have been telling me  about your
 escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back 
and ask about some thing you had said previously a
bout the last trip to 
Poland. YOU said it was a 
harrowing trip. Can you tell me  about that  trip? 

 

Jutta Levy: Well as I ma y have me ntioned we went 
back at the insist ence of my late mother. She 
wanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents an
d sister and all the rela
tives. So she took my 
sister and of course me , back to Poland. Now 
to go to Poland from Ha mburg Germany, you get 

on the train and you have to go through no ma n™s la
nd. That™s that stretch 
of land at that time , 
that was quote unquote free.  That meant pass
ing borders. You™re goi
ng through border. Every 
border stop is a stop and the offi
cials come  on boa rd. We ll at that time , this is late 38, the 

Germans of course, the Nazis come on board an
d searched, questioned, ve
ry body on the train. I 
didn™t know at the time what strip search meant.  
I was a little past 12 years old and I found that 

out in a big hurry.  Because of a ma tronly Ge
rman woma n took the women  aside and strip 

searched them. I was one of them. And if anybody ha
s ever been strip searched and especially  
by an  angry, German official of the Nazis, 
strip searching a young Jewi
sh girl, you can imagine 
what that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and wit
hout getting graphic very 
nasty and impersonal.  
It is one of the most unpleasant experience that
 I had personally and I th
ink that™s all I™m going 
to say about that.  I think one can imagine what that
 was like.  They ma de i t  difficult. They let us 
go but they ma de it unpleasant, difficult, and also 
very, very frightening.  
I was dreading the trip 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 32 
 
back home because I hadn™t even gotten there 
yet because I was afraid that I™d have to go 
through that again. But me rcifully I did not. 
They were very thorough about checking our 
luggage, checking us personally but this intense st
rip search was not repe
ated.  But it was going 
out of Ger many to Poland. Why they didn™t do it 
on the way back quite in that ma nner I don™t™ 
know.  It™s was ma ybe a fluke or
 maybe the other was. I don™t know.   they were angry people 
that, I think if they had had the 
chance they would have thrown us off the train. Just to be never 
heard from a gain which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of.   Again, 

we were lucky.  Some times not knowing a lot of
 things, not knowing what had already been 
done is a blessing. 

 

Q: I™m going to ask you. You just said a mo me
nt ago that they had already done, they had 
already thrown people off the tr
ain. Can you clarify that point? 
 
A: in Hamb urg where we lived as I said prev
iously  people began disappearing.  Especially 
people, 
Aust Juden
 which are the Jews from eastern Eur
ope began disappearing. My parents for 
instance had a couple.   I can even reme mber
 their name , Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who 
disappeared. We  learned later on I 
learned later on. My parents knew 
even before that they were 
rounded up. They were taken away put on a train, se
nt to what I keep referring to as no ma n™s 
land in the dead of winter.  Told to get off at 
a given point. Oh they weren™t the only ones. There 
were hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. 
 And just let go.  Chased off the train, let go, in 
the dead of winter.  If the people didn™t move
 fas t  enough for them, they were shot. If they 

ma naged to get away, who knows where they went.Some  ma naged to escape to other parts of 

the world. Ot hers froze to death. Others were
 shot to death.  These stories have been 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 33 
 
documented. These stories my father found out and 
I did to after a time . At the time  that I™m 
talking about now when we went legally to Poland, legally to Poland. I mean they could have 
done what they wanted to.  But they didn™t.  At
 the time we did not know what had already been, 
the atrocities that ha d already been co mmitted. 
We  didn™t™ know.  Communications as I™ve said 

before was certainly nothing like it, not anywhere 
near what it is today. 
Had it been I don™t think 
I™d be having this interview.  

 

Q: When you got to your relatives in
 Poland, what was that visit like? 
 

A: Heart wrenching.  Very heart wrenching. Notbecause of any dark premonitions, certainly not 

on my grandparents, my relatives side. In fact my  
grandfather was a very in
telligent very this is 
not my mate rnal grandfather who 
is a professional ma n. Very far 
sighted very ahead of the times. 
But he could not foresee nor did 
he the tragedy that was to co
me  to Poland. What was happening 
in Germany he felt as so ma ny peopl e did at  that
 time, not so much anymore with German Jews. 
But living in Poland was like living 
in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country 
here. He just felt that it mi ght pass. But he al
so fully understood why we  had to leave given the 
circumstances I™ve described before.   Lack 
of ma king a living, the name  calling the anti-
Se mitism is a mild word for what was happening.  The burning destruction of synagogues. He 

was well aware of that. So with 
a lot of understanding he wished 
us of course the best but was 
sad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It
 was a heart wrenching experience, muc h more so 
for my mother and it was for my 
sister and me  too. I felt it ma ybe 
a little more keenly being older 
and I loved my fa mily there dearly especially 
my grandparents, my ma t e rnal and my paternal 
grandmother in her, on my father™s side. What wa
s also very heart breaking I mi ght add is that 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 34 
 
my father, my late father was never able to go back because  of the reasons I stated be fore. 
Especially for his mother and his side of the fa
mily. Realizing that we were leaving, realizing 
that perhaps they would never see him again 
was conveyed and understood by me  even at my 
young age. So that whole trip was very fast. We didn™t™ stay long.  And again very, very heart 

wrenching.  Sad, sad.  

 

Q:  Did you notice any changes in
 the social attitudes toward 
Jews in Poland at that visit 
 

A: No. At that visit I wasn™t even exposed all th
at much.  We  ma inly visited. I also vested with 
my girlfriend and I had friends ove
r there but especially one who al
so did survive. Her fa mily did 
not.  No I can™t honestly say. My grandmother sti
ll, my maternal grandmother still had help in 
the house. MY grandfather™s practice was continui
ng on. No I can™t say  at that, don™t™ forget.  

They were al ways some what anti-Semitic, some  a gr
eat deal Anti-Semitic.  I never felt it to that 
extent.  After all I was a visito
r. And by a visitor I mean visite
d fa mily and loved ones and was 
loved in return so ma ybe  we were 
shielded, although I don™t™ think so. 
 

Q: Did your cousin or your friend ask you about
 what was happening in your life back in 
Germany  during that visit. 

 

A: Oh yeah they did.  And as best I could explai
ned, especially about they were interested in the 
school, what was happening in school.  What was  
happening to some  of the friends that I had 

back in Hamburg who a lot of them at that poin
t already weren™ t there anymore. They had either 
emigrated or were taken away. and of course their 
fate was unknown to  me  at that time  as with a 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 35 
 
lot of them even to this day their fate is unknow
n to me . So ye s they asked and as best I could, 
as, as kids we™re all we were all the same age. 
I had explained to them and they were interested 
in what was going on   thinking surely this would 
never come into their lives. Little did they 
know but a few months later they ma rche
d in, the Nazis.  Into Poland. And thei
r lives changed.            
 

Q: You told me  about  leaving Germany. And I 
wanted to ask you to think back and just once 
more reflect about the mo me nt when you we
re out of Nazi Occupied territory. 
 

A: Unbelievable as I have told you. Fi rst of all the 
relief of my  father ge
tting back on the train.  
Knowing that mo me ntarily we were crossing into 
a place that was not Nazi Germany.  It™s ha rd 
to explain when you realize that you can say someth
ing without being fearful, being afraid. I told 
you that life had become  full of fear, nervous stom
ach, that kind of fear. People here are people 
in general unless they went through a similar ex
perience can™t understand. 
It™s not fear of an 
exam, it™s not fear of, it™s a totally different fear. 

 

Q:  With respect to that fear that you™re just
 describing. You mentioned a nervous stomach. We re 
there are any other symptoms or ma nifestations 
of this fear that you can reme mber fr om your 
childhood. 

 

A: Me personally. That nervous 
stomach that developed when I was a kid has stayed with me  to 
this day, to me . I can™t attribut
e hyper, I suffer from hyper tension. 
I can™t attribute that to it, 
although my father developed hyper tension there.
 And ultimately actually died from that 
because we didn™t™ have the drugs that they have
 today for it.  But he had hypertension,  I have 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 36 
 
hypertension. It™s an inherited th
ing probably.  But I™m more keenly aware of a nervous stomach 
which I developed and I still have it.
  I don™t know how to describe it. 
it™s fear even to this day of 
a uniform.  My father had a business here downt
own and I™m digressing a little bit and he ma de 
friends with all the police whic
h was in downtown Wa shington y
ears and years and years ago.  
Every time a police man would come  up to collec
t for some thing or just to come  up and say 
hello, my father froze.  Every time  a uniform ca
me  in during the war. A friend of mi ne was in 
uniform, whether it be army or na
vy uniform, especially officers, 
he froze.  Mome ntarily and I 
have to tell you I do too.  And I wasn™t, I had frie
nds that were in the se
rvice, but the mome nt 
when you see a uniform that is the fear that 
developed over a period of
 time  and you live under a 
regime for that many years.
 six years is a long time . 
 

Q:  Often time s children will have nightma res 
if they™re anxi ous about so me thing. Is that 
some thing that was true in your experience.  
 
A: I think so. And this was before we left.  Wh
en you hear footsteps at night on ma rble floors, 

boots, and they™re not, you don™t know but they™re not stopping at your
 door but they are 

stopping some place else and you hear conversations a
nd it gets loud you can™t help but take this 
with you when you go to sleep or if you™re awakened
 by it. It™s hard then to go back to sleep. 
Sure.  It™s a, it was a fearful frightful I don™t kno
w how else to say it time in my life. I can seek 
for myself.  Not knowing all the rami ficat
ions but knowing enough 
to be afraid.  
 

Q: Let™s go back to your trip out of Germ
any.  Tell me  about route through Europe. 
 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 37 
 
A: We  went by way of Aachen. It
™s near the border where my father was taken off the train.  And 
once you are through that you™re in Be lgium. And 
there™s another stop and more uniforms come  
in. The uniforms at this point though are Belgia
n officials who spoke Fr
ench and not German.  
So once we got past that and they were, they we
re official, they were 
to the point but even 
though we were fearful but there wa
s nothing really to be afraid of
 at that point but as I said 
before, you don™t get over that. Once we got thr
ough that border, don™t™ forget there were ma ny 
other people on the train in the compartments othe
r than us that were on the run.  Some with only 
the clothes on their back, no luggage even.  But then
 they started to talk a little bit.  Without 
fearing that they would be arrested or they w
ould be overheard for saying some thing that wasn™t 
politically correct.  And what stuc
k in my mi nd to this day is that
 people smuggled things out.  In 
the most ingenious way. I reme mber one lady had 
I don™t™ know if it was a coat or a jacket but 
her big buttons about the 
size of ma ybe even bigger than a ha
lf a dollar and she was so proud of 
herself, as we ll she should have been, that sh
e was able to smuggle out diamonds that were 
hidden in the hollow of those bu
ttons and I reme mber that and I was totally amazed. But in 
retrospect how she got away with that. How they
 didn™t, I mean this was just one.  Pe ople had 
other ways of bringing things acr
oss.  But that, that was one th
ing that stuck in my mi nd. That 
they were so relieved that  they al most star ted to
 share and I did this and 
I did that and they were 
saying, well they were basically trashing the Nazi
s which they hadn™t been
 able to do all these 
years.  Being afraid to be overh
eard or if some body, if they fe
lt they were with some body that 
they could trust and they coul
dn™t trust them. That was anothe
r thing.  So you know it goes on 
and on. It goes on and when you live under a regime
 like that and people like ourselves, people 
like myself it takes a while to trust again and to 
say wow I can say this.  And believe it or not, 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 38 
 
even to this day and I™m almost 71, even to this da
y I can say that (fully? ) . 
 I can say that.  I can 
be critical.  I have never ev
er taken that for granted.   
 
Q:  Continue on with your trip. 

 

A: So we then came to the rest of it was 
uneventful.  When I say uneventful, nothing is 

uneventful and you™re sitting with people that were
 running away from a dict
atorship such as we 
were running away from so not
hing is uneventful. But we don™t 
want to be repetitious. I don™t 
want to be.     We  got to Paris where my mo
ther had her brother there and we stayed there 
waiting for the Queen Mary to take us to Ameri
ca.  While we were in Paris, an incident 
happened that really changed 
the rest of Ger many forever.
 And that was the young Jewish 
fellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was 
his name and he killed an attaché in Paris of 

the German embassy.  M ost people are, historiansare very mu ch aware of that. This of course 
caused a tremendous upheaval in Ge
rmany and that is a, it culmin
ated what they call here now 
Kristallnacht , the ni ght of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of 
frustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can
 think of and I will say this, go on record 
and have said it before.  That was the culminatio
n this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass. 
They had been doing these things, certainly in 
Hamburg and other pl aces in Germany all that 
year and certainly all that fall a
nd early winter while I was still in
 Germany. I heard oh yes, store 
fronts being broken into. And I kne
w of book burnings. I saw some  of it.  And I what I think we 
mean by Kristallnacht which we were  still in Europe then. But it was the culmination of and so I 

only want to say that after that it was a mi racle, 
as it was a mi racle with 
us that we got out of 
Germany at the time  that we did. After that we
 would not have been a relatively no it wasn™t 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 39 
 
easy, but it would not have been let™s say legally to
 use that term.  Because we left legally. We 
had proper pa pers.  After that there wa s no such 
thing.   He was done with, Hitler was done with 
German Jews.  If he hadn™t annihilated them if
 we hadn™t gotten out, th
ei r life wasn™t worth a 
plugged nickel. Because shortly thereafter he moved into Poland. 
 

Q: While you were in Paris and 
your hearing this news, what 
was the reaction of people around 
you. 

 

A: First of all my father was appalled. I keep re
ferring to my  father because he was a very strong 
infl uence in my life. He was, I listened.  I listen
ed.   When he and my unc le and other, we had 
other relatives in Paris were talk
ing about this incident it was with
 (pause) regret that this had 
happened because it put in jeopardy so ma ny people,
 which of course it did.  It also was with 
some  relief that we were out because  had the, had 
we not left exactly when we did.  And  I me an 
almost to the mi nute, I wouldn™t™ be talking to you 
today. We got out just at
 the nick of time, six 
hours before the Gestapo came to my  house.  That
 this young ma n chose th
at day that week to 
shoot the German attaché, causi
ng tremendous uproar in Germany, 
and t he fact that we were no 
longer there was very fortunate for us.  So yeah 
we had there was a tremendous amount of relief.  
On my father, my parents™ part and of course
 transcended to me . And 
even though I mi ght have 
left  with a lot of sadness leaving 
behind friends and stuff.  And a 
life.  I having had it explained 
to me  what was going on at that point and papers 
being full of it, radio, I 
was to tell you that I 
was pretty happy being out of there.  Natura
lly not knowing what was facing us in a new 
country, in a new life, but still we
 did not have to fear for the N
azis. There were other fears. So 
yes, generally that™s the reaction.  And again I™
m talking as someone who 
at that point  was 12, a 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 40 
 
little over 12 years old.  So I 
am, my reactions we re through my 
parents and other relatives that 
were there.   
 

Q:  Is there anything else th
at stands out in your mi nd on 
your stay there in Paris.  
 

A: My father had a cousin in Paris w
ho lived outside Paris.  Their name  was 
Gothelf.
 The first 
cousin was a well-known 
artist there, Sa m 
Za m u s h
 
Gothelf,
 a well-known artist. He had a son, 
12 years old and here I meet this handsome you
ng fellow. He was about 15, 16 at the time. And 
at 12 years old the hormo nes alr
eady are working a littl
e bit so of course I immediately fell in 
love with this young cousin.  He wrote a b
eautiful poem in my autograph book. Re me mber I 
never go anywhere without my autograph book.  He wa
s also an artist.  He  even drew a beautiful 

little picture.  A forlorn seashore 
because we were leaving and turns 
out that this cousin we heard 
later who I really liked so very much.  His na
me  was Guy, Guy, G-U-Y.  
Joined the resistance 
and was shot as was his father. And needless to 
say although I found this out
 several years later, 
it saddened me  deeply. He was, they were tale
nted lovely, lovely people. And especially the 

young fellow who I, who I liked so much.  Actually 
I would say that was my first real crush.  So 
the other thing leaving 
there we had to go to 
Cherbourg.
  And everything happens at night. I 
don™t know why. Late at night we got to 
Cherbourg,
 got on a tender.  Everything was black.  
Everything was sort of blacked 
out.  And all of a sudden this
 humongous monster appears in the 
water.  And that was the Queen Mary with a few 
little lights he re and there. This huge  to me  

then and of course it is huge ship out there th
at we  had to get on. And 
I have to tell you I was 
scared to death, but we got on the ship and st
arted our voyage across. In Nove mber, the mi ddle 
of Nove mbe r  when the seas are pretty rough.  So 
and we along with ma ny 
other people left.   

Interview with JuttaLevy
 41 
 
 
Q: Anybody stand out in your mi nd who was on the ship with you.  

 

A:  As a ma tter of fact, I have pictures, tiny li
ttle pictures. There was 
a couple and I don™t™ know 
if, where in Germany they were fr
om, but they were from Germany 
that traveled and left as we 
did.  Basically the same  circumstances that we
re traveling with ver
y, very young children, babes 
in arms and I do have a pictur e of them. Because I,
 I loved autographs and pictur es if I could get 

them. And I do believe  they also wrot e in my autograph book. They stand out because I, even 

though I don™t™ know where they came 
from but traveling with ver
y, very young children into an 
unknown situation.  

 

Q: Did you ma ke any fri e nds on the ship? 

 
A: No other than, well acquaintan
ces but nothing lasting.  It™s weir
d that on the same  ship which 
I found out later was a school ma te of mi ne who boa
rded the ship before I did because the ship 
came, the Queen Mary came from Southampton to 
Cherbourg
. She boarded. She and her family 
boarded the ship in Southampton. They left before
 I did but we never ran into each ot he r.  That 
ship is a bi g one, was a big one, still is. I™v
e been back on it when it was in Long Beach, 
California. 
 

Q: Tell me  about arriving in the United States. 

 

A: That is quite some thing.  We  got on deck at 
7:00 in the morning that the ship was comi ng into 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 42 
 
the New York harbor and it was mi sty, it was cold, 
it was gray.  As I expected it would be.  And 
I don™t know because I think life was gray and kind of sad at that point. The thing that was 
pointed out to us was the Statue of Liberty a
nd I had heard about it but 
vaguely. And I couldn™t™ 
tell you if I knew the significan
ce of it but I soon learned becaus
e people were talking about it. 
and to see the Statue of Liberty 
and people talking about what it 
meant that we are now free and 
to pursue, to, to worship, to all th
e things that it really stands for.
  To have people talk about it in 
German because that™s all I spoke at the time
, that was quite a mo me nt.  Thinking back on it 
now.  Getting off the ship was quite some thing el
se agai n.  My fa ther got down on his hands and 

knees and he kissed the concrete ground as he ca
me off the boat. And that™s a mo ment I won™t 
forget. The next thing that I saw was a stevedor e 
that just that one stevedor e. I reme mber. He 
was black and I had not seen too ma ny black people
 before. In fact I hadn™t, I had seen one. And 
he was in flowing robes and sort 
of a diplomat in Ha mburg.  So 
and then at first not seeing my 
relatives, well I mean I had never me t them, you know and then my father pointed out over there 
his brother  and his two br
others actually.  The one that had le
ft before us and the one that had 
been here for ma ny years. I have no other impr
essions. It was very overwhelming, very, very 
overwhelming.  And if you want me  to continue 
on in that vein. The uncle was there that had 
signed our affidavit. We  went to
 his home. we spent one night th
ere and I was separated from my 
parents which   was almo st as trauma tic as that
 whole experience of leav
ing Germany.  So if you 
want me to continue on that
 I™d be glad to do that. 
 
Q: I™d like you to reflect on some  of the difficulti
es in general.  I don™t™ need it necessarily day 
by day account, but overall what were the difficultie
s that you had adjusting to life in the United 
States 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 43 
 
 
A: To begin with it was awful.  Because as I st
arted to tell you, I was here one day, new country, 
new language, new everything and my parents went 
off to Detroit Michigan where my father™s 
two brothers were and I was to go with this gr
eat aunt and uncle who 
lived in Wa shington, DC, 
people that I didn™t™ know, really never he
ard of them, but this was my gr andmother 
Salzberg
, 
my paternal grandmother™s sist
er and her husband who said that
 they would take me  because 
there was not enough room for me  in
 Detroit.  So since I was th
e older of the two daughters, I 
was the one that was elected to go with them. 
 Now comi ng to a new country, being here one 

day, at most two days and one night and then le
aving my parents and my sister was t, do you use 
the word trau matic. It  was traumatic. I came here 
with them on the train.  They were very nice 
people. They didn™t™ understand me , I didn™t under
stand them. They talked Yiddish but German 
and Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if
 your ear isn™t used to
 it you don™t understand.  
And they tried, ma ybe a little bit 
of German but it was I didn™t understand and I had to go with 
them. And nobody™s going to feel sorry for me  b
ecause they had a beautiful home . they were 

very well heeled people.  He had a chauffeur 
driven car in Wa shington.  And so I don™t want 
anybody feeling sorry for me . I just felt sorry for me
.  It was my heart was aching.  I was alone. I 
felt like I had been left, like I had been abandone
d.  And so I was not a happy person when I first 
came here. And I must say even though these 
people were wonderful, they meant well. The 
Ul ma ns, U-L-M-A-N.  They were very good to 
me . They were generous.  But I was very 
unhappy and very lonesome .   

 

Q: We  have to pause so we can change tape. 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 44 
 
Q: This is an interview for the US Holocaust
 Memorial Museum, I™m interviewing Jutta Levy. 
This is tape 2, side b and you were telling me  a
bout being se pa rated from your parent s  and your 
sister and comi ng to the Washington DC area with
 other relatives.  How long did you stay apart 
from your parents. 
 

A: About nine months.  Nine months.  Yeah and 
I want to say that I was comfortable. I had, my 
physical needs were taken care of. 
 I was treated very well. They 
sent me  to the Americanization 
school. They bought me  a couple of more Americanized
 clothes.  Not mu ch, a little bit.  They 

had other family here from his side. He was, 
Mr. Ul ma n was not my blood relative but his wife 
my aunt, great aunt I mi ght say that
 part. So his he had family here
 and they weren™t  too nice to 
me  but I frankly didn™t™ realize 
that until I understood a little bit 
more but they sent me to the 
Americanization school.  Downtown at 13
th
 and New York Avenue. The building is still 
standing.  So I was put in with, I was the only kid 
there.  They were all adults. To say that I 
disliked it is putting it mildly.  
I hated it.  And I don™
t think I got a whole lo
t out of it because I 
was frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself 
to sleep.  I don™t™ know. I woke up crying.  I 

was lonesome . They tried very hard
. I, I need to say that they 
tried hard and I guess they thought 
I was happy. They had a business here. He took me  
to the business with him. I had no chores to 
do.  I basically had nothing to do.  I would go 
the Americanization school which was not a good 
experience for me.  They didn™t put me into a 
school and I wonder, years later why not.  But 

that™s how it went. If my  fa
ther called I would cry and tell him how unha ppy I was and a few 
months later he did ma ke a trip to Washington 
to see me . I did not see my mother that whole 
time.  And he came here and he promised that 
as soon as he could esta
blish hims elf some where 
and he was hopeful it would be other than Detroit. 
He didn™t™ like Detroit. 
 We would all get, be

together again and at that time 
he looked around Washington and he 
really liked it but he at that 
time had no knowledge of how he would arrange 
ma king a living and comi ng here. So he went 
back to Detroit.  About nine months later, ma ybe a little more but let™s sa
y nine, nine and a half 

months later my father did pick up with my mo
ther and my sister and moved to New York. My 
mother had some  cousins there.  And he felt ma ybe 
that would be better. He
 didn™t™ like Detroit, 
didn™t like what was going on there between the br
others, et cetera. And he came  to New York 
and once I  knew that they were in  I wanted to
 be there also.  And he came and he got me . And 
from a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Nort
hwest Wa shington I went with my, I went to a 
walk up apartment at 91
st
 and Amsterdam Avenue.  Right al
ong with the bedbugs, rats and the 
mi ce.  But you know what I was happy cause we were
 all together at this 
point.  Then he started 
to, he started to look for work do work. He sold
 hair ribbons, stockings. 
If he ma de two dollars 
he would spend it to buy then ma de two more do
llars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we 
could eat and have the rent. We  
had very little money.  We  did 
not come  here with bundles of 
money.  He my mother ma de hair ribbons and my 
sister and I helped an
d various other things 
like that. And in the meantime all the while looki
ng for some  type of wor
k.  Without getting too 
wordy on this. About not too ma ny months, 
not too ma ny months, he found a position 
representing a company that sold
 basically the same  things that
 he sold in Germany.  For the 
territory that encompassed Wash
ington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started 

thinking about ma king the move to Washington so he 
could be closer to the 
territory that he was 
to represent. And that was for 
him a dream come  true because 
he already liked New York. He 
didn™t™ love it, but he 
did love Wa shington.  A good reason. It wa
s a beautiful city. It was cleaner 
at that time .  Than New York and very much 
like Ha mburg.  He always used to say it remi nded 
him, it was that type of city.  So I would say w
ithin a year™s time we ma
de  a move here.  And I 

Interview with JuttaLevy

mi ght add, I did start public school 
in New York.  In those days th
ey put you in class. It was sink 
or swim.  Or  is it swim or sink. I don™t know.  Bu
t I was put into sixth grade which of course I 
promptly flunked because I didn™t know how to talk
 but I did have a young 
girl in my class. I 
know her name  because she did an autograph. May 
Corbet who was a black girl who helped me . 
The only person in that class in New York that 
helped me .  How I don™t even reme mb er.  I guess 
with sign language and little by lit
tle I started to learn English. I 
also listened to the radio a lot. 
And went to the movies a lot, a lot.  Because that
 was an escape.  And it was, and I liked it. I was 
a movie fan in Germany and just a 
fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the 

movies a lot.  In New York and of course cont
inued it here.  But I did 
lose some  schooling along 
the way.  Number one I didn™t go to school. 
Number two I flunked and but here I am. 
 

Q: Can you give me  a time fra me. When 
did you first arrive in this country? 
 
A: We ca me here, it™s, it was 17
th
, 17
th
 of Nove mb er. Into, we came to America the 17
th
 of 
Nove mber 1938.   
 

Q: What was the time  fr ame that you were in Washington.  

 

A: I was here from then, ma ybe two days later, ma ybe the 19
th
 until the summer of 39. So from 
Nove mber  I was with the aunt a
nd uncle until the summer of 39.   
 

Q: Where were you when you first heard 
about the German invasion of Poland? 
 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 47 
 
A: We  were  at that time  already in Ne w Yor
k. That was in August of 39 I believe. No. I think, 
well I think I was I think I was al
ready with my parents. I™m not 100% sure. It ma y well I must 
have been. I don™t really
 recollect 100%.   
 
Q:  Can you recall, what was the sense in this co
untry to the news comi ng out of what is now war 
torn Europe? 

 

A: What was my, my no I reme mber I™m a teenager 
at this point. I want  to just go back a little 
bit. I have in my possession and I remember getting when we first came to Washington, so we 

were already in Wa shington.  Sketchy ma il, ma ybe
 a postcard from my fa mily in Poland.  You 
know my father™s mother wrote and her family wr
ote for her and my grandfather wrote. So we 
were already in Wa shington when we heard about 
the invasion of Poland. And  I have to say that 
it was devastating news to my parents.  Heari
ng that the Germans had marched into Poland.  We  
then knew nothing further. As far as the what happ
ened in Europe, in all of Europe as it became 
war torn, it was a tragedy it was te
rrible. Again what happened other 
than the, the fact that  I had 
so much fa mily in Poland but the fact that I ha
d friends over here who at
 that point being 17, 18 
years old drafted into the army or signing up fo
r the army maybe, whatever going into service. 
And some  of them never  to come  back. Or h
earing almost imme diately  they were killed. 
Because already I™m a, at this point  I™m a teenager
 too. And I again have friends that went off to 
war and never came back. 

 

Q: During the time between the beginning of th
e war, with the attack
 on Poland being a time 
when American got involved, is there anything in 
that time frame  that stands out in your mi nd? 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 48 
 
 
A: Primarily the fact that my parents tried very ha
rd to get in touch with their families in Poland.  
Never hearing again. There was conversation that 
things were very difficult in Poland for our 
fa milies  there.  We  did not  and I reiterate 
did not know all the rami fications of what was 
happening.  But we knew I should say the adults, 
my parents knew that 
 whatever it was, it 
wasn™t good. And having escaped from that regi
me  ourselves, we knew that whatever was 

happening wasn™t good. It was a co
nstant fear of what was ha
ppening over there.  To our 
fa milies. And we™re talking Poland specifically. 
My father was a news hound.  He liked, he 
wanted to listen to the radio constantly when he
 wasn™t, when he was home. WE didn™t dare talk 
while he was listening to the news
 because he was anxious to know 
every little bit that there was 
of what was going on in the world.  Primarily inEurope and more specifically in Poland. And 

not a whole to came out. Again, given the lack
 of knowledge as far as communication is 
concerned as we know it today. Some things leak
ed out of course, not leaked out but became 
known but again things move ve
ry swiftly once that Hitler ma rched into Poland. It wa s a 
progression that went along very 
swiftly as history tells us to
day.  And we all know it. Poland 
was not the only stop he ma de. He 
made  quite a few other stops and it wa s a constant search for 
news and for us specifically.  But of course my
 father became agitated every country that he 
went into.  That Hitler went in
to, he was agitated. And he was in
 a constant state of agitation and 
frustration.  And also ma king a 
living, ma king a living. My mother
 worked and at 14 I went to 
work.  I don™t know what else 
to say about that period.  
 

Q: Do you reme mber Pearl Harbor? 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 49 
 
A: Oh definitely. Certainly.  It was on a S
unday of course as everybody knows.  If you must 
know I was taking a bath. We  were four people. At
 that time we were already in a two bedroom 
apartment. To begin with we were four people 
in a one bedroom apartme nt. And shortly before 
Pearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and a t  
2:00  I took my bath. And I heard my father 
about that time yelling that the Japanese had at
tacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where 
Pearl Harbor was.  Obviously he did. And 
I quickly got out and I thought what™s going on, 
what™s going on and he explained that Pearl Har
bor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US 
possession or protectorate. I don™t know what you 
call it. And essentially we would be at war 
with the Ja pa nese. I ha ve  to tell you though that ther
e was a little bit of a l
ilt to him, to my dad 
because he fe lt that once the Japane se , once Amer
ica and at that time  
Roosevelt had not been 
declared but he and his friends a
nd there was lots of talking going 
on. Once they declared war on  
the Japanese, as certainly they
 did it wouldn™t be too long be
fore we would declare war on 
Germany. And they were waiting for that, they were 
 waiting for that.  As much as people didn™t 
want to go war in Amer ica or Americans to go to
 war, people like my dad and at this point we 
too felt better get in there. Have to put a stop 
to what™s going on. So it was horrible, horrible, 
horrible.  And things happened so quickly  with
in a period of two, three days. First Japan, then 
Germany and of course we knew about the Blitzkr
ieg and we  at this time knew I don™t want to 
jump ahead of me. 
 

Q: At this time  you kne w, you wa
nt to finish that sentence. 
 

A: Yeah we knew that certainly 
not all of what was going on in th
e camps or anything like that.  
You know we didn™t know that. We
 knew some , we knew some .  We
 didn™t know to what extent 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 50 
 
our own fa milies were involved 
in that. We  didn™t™ know.  But 
we knew there were evil things 
going on all over Europe where Hitler had invade
d and we certainly knew about, we knew about 
the French, his ma rching into France. And we 
certainly knew about the 
Blitzkr ieg between the 
bombings of London and Britain and what was 
going on over there.  We  did. I me an we had 
news commentators, radio, newspapers so we ce
rtainly were aware and it was for that reason 
people felt, people like my father
 I don™t want to include all Amer
icans, felt that it was time that 
the Americans took a stand and got involved also.  To save Europe. 

 

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or any 
anti-foreign sentiment in this country. 
 

A: Not Anti-Se mitism as I knew it. Anti-Semitism as I knew it in Germany, no. No, no, no, no.  

Anti-refugee. Anti-refugee, anti-refugee. You know
 we™re foreigners. For several years I had a 
guttural accent.  Germany was not popular. Having a guttural German accent, didn™t exactly 
ma ke me  queen of the day.  I fought hard and bitter 
to lose it, got into fights.  Kids made fun of 
me . People that I™m friends with to this day 
ma de fun of me and I had, I was a tomboy. I had 
fights with them. I™d beat them up, they™d beat me
 up.  As far as anti-refugee as my parents ex, 
mi ght have experienced it, I don™t think so. My
 father was a personable man, a likeable person.  
Straightforward, honest ma n and he ma de a living, starting to ma ke a living, worked hard.  My 
mother did and as I said I went to work at 14 
myself.  But I knew that if I wanted to get along, 
and wanted to belong that I needed to learn English. And I did so in r
ecord speed I mi ght add, 
although at the time it didn™t seem like it but I did. 
But I have people here friends to this day. I 
was just with one of them that reme mbers when
 I really couldn™t speak the language as I am 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 51 
 
speaking to you today. But once I di d, and it™s b
een ma ny ye ars and I speak without an accent. 
Once I got over that there was no I didn™t experience that anymore.  (pause) 
 

Q: I want to ask you when did you begin to real
ize what was happening or what had happened to 
the Jews in Nazi occupied Europe? 

 

A:  Well in Germany of course we knew. Because
 we left. So we know more or less what had 
happened in Germany. As far as the countries that
 he occupied. For instance in for us more 
importantly Poland, we got a phone call. We  knew th
at things were not good.  Things had started 
to come  out. My father was very, very concerne
d. My parents were about, and other people, but 
we™re specifically talking about
 my family.  We  knew that many evil things had gone on there 
and I refer to them as evil things as opposed 
to say anything else.  Just how bad and how our 
fa milies were affected, we really didn™t know.  It
 was a nightmare that was going to come true. 
Then we got a telephone call from Sweden, from moth
er™s sister. Flora Kerner
 at that time .  And, 
telling  us that she and my, her daughter my cousi
n, Rita, had survived but 
that everyone else in 
our fa mily had perished. I reme mber my father
 being on the telephone and falling to hi s knees 
because he was so very emotionally upset, draine
d.  And very other thing that you can name .  It 
wasn™t a long conversation but it was enough so that
 he got an almost full pictur e of filling in 
gaps of things that we had only heard about or re
ad about or listened to 
on the radio and now his 
worst nightmare come true as far as
 our personal fa mily was concerned.  
 

Q: When did you get this phone call? 

 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 52 
 
A: Very shortly after my  aunt had my cousin we
re liberated from Bergen Belsen and I have to 
correct myself. They called from the what™s the 
camp called.  Where they put people. They were 
liberated by the British.  To get them ready to go 
to Sweden and I can™t think of the term. It™s 
displaced person™s camp they were put in. And th
at™s where my aunt called from. It took several 
days after liberation because they we re very
 generous from what I understand about having 
survivors call but my aunt had not been well. She 
had contracted typhus, I 
believe it was.  So it 
took a few days, ma ybe not even extra days, but
 it took time. and there were thousands and 
thousands of extra pe ople in various camps that 
were tryi ng to reach family all over the world. 
But she did call us and she told us at that time, 
she would call us again when they got to Sweden 
because that was where they were going.  
 

Q: What kinds of things had 
you heard about what happened to 
the Jews before you got that 
phone call. You said that this filled in some
 gaps . Can you recall what things you heard? 
 

A: Well, you know my parentsspe,
 and more specifically my fath
er had heard a lot of things 
about concentration camps and murdering Jews, cr
ematoriums. These things started late in the 
war years, or end, towards the end of the war.  
Don™t forget soldiers were already comi ng back.  
Not that he me t the m pe rsonally. Some  yes, so
me not, but there was th
e me dia and so he did 
know about camps, cre matoriums.  He knew about
 Dachau, or he knew about Dachau early on 
but not knowing exactly Dachau came  into existence 
as I said, I think I said
 earlier in 33.  But the 
atrocities that were being committed were some
body™s worst nightmare and hearing them prior 

to getting this telephone call and from the news 
me dia and the people that had already come  back 

so, wounded soldiers et cetera, ma de it, it becam
e very factual and he could only, we could only 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 53 
 
imagine what had happened to our own fa mily. 
 However, always hopeful that perhaps they 
weren™t as touched as so many thousands, millions
 were. At that point  we weren™t thinking in 
terms of mi l lions. We didn™t™ know.  At least 
I didn™t know but we knew that bad things had 
happened over there.  We could only hope that 
we  would get some  good news that families had 
survived, some  of our fa mily if not all had surv
ived.  Hearing that they
 hadn™t other than my 
mother™s sister and her daughter 
was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was 
horrific. It wa s my mother and my father were de
vastated as was I. At th
at point already I was on 
my way, I was and adult just about, an adult al
ready and I reme mbered being very pained, very, 
very pained. To say the very least.
 It™s an awful feeling to hear 
that all your fa mily that you left 
behind but two people had perished. 
And at that time  we really 
didn™t know exactly who died in 
which way. We didn™t know that exactly  until they came here.  And I™m getting ahead but my 

aunt and my  cousin came here after Sweden, not 
too in 1946. So about a y
ear, a little over a year 
after they we re liberated. My father brought th
em home . He , if you like I can tell you when they 
called him fr om Sweden which was ma ybe a we ek 
after their initial call,
 he imme diately went 
and I went with him, this is now 1945. Imme dia t
ely went to I believe it
 was the Red Cross. I 
reme mber going on a Saturday downt own with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and 

the wire services, $50, which to us was like it w
ould be $5000 today. Got it 
together and sent it 
to my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here.  

Which he did.  He had them sponsor ed by my aunt
, the lady that I lived with here. They were 
moneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the 
affidavit. She didn™t blink an eye and signed it, 
not with all the problems that we had.  And we tr
ied to get her over here and did of course.  And 
but we paid for their passage, and we set up an 
apartment for them where we lived. And he went 
and, and worked very hard, along with my moth
er. And I reme mber going with him to these 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 54 
 
various places to bring them over here. So I want
 to give him,  my father and my mother all 
respect and credit that™s due them 
for  acting as quickly as they did 
in seeing to the comfort and to 
bringing these two survivors over into what my 
father called the land of milk and honey which 
he was not an original of that expression. But he
 loved America and the o
pportunities that it gave 
him and he wanted them here.  

 

Q:  When they did come , did you ask you 
cousin what her experience had been? 

 

A:  One afternoon, we lived as I said in the same
 apartment unit, Peabody Street, she and I were 
out back.  We were basically the same  age and in 
fact we recently talked about this very thing 
I™m telling you now.  I asked her, what was it 
like?   What was camp, conc entration camp like?   
Well for two hours or mo re my cousin told me  gr
aphically as graphic as
 she could get exactly 
what camp was like, what ghetto was like, what cam
p was like for her because I have since heard 
other stories but that was 
my first.  And I was absolutely horrified.  Talk about nightma res, if I 
didn™t™ have terrible nightmares before, I sure 
had them after that.  Here wa s some body in front 
of me  that had lived through thes
e horrors and they were other pe
ople that had worse stories. But 
her story and it™s been docume nted was not pleasant
, it was horrible. Wh at my aunt and she went 
through and my fa mily.  Telling me  that how my 
grandparents died, how my, my father™s family 

died, how my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, 
how they all died at 
various stages of the 
internme nt, in the gas chambers, in the ghettos, ju
st disappearing. One goes 
to the left, the other 
one goes to the right. One meant certain death, on
e was uncertain.  Hearing 
all that just between 
the two of us was about one of my worst experi
ences and I™m sure it was, I think probably the 
fi rst time that she really talked about it. And 
for years and years and years afterward, we never 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 55 
 
talked about it again.  My cousin™s na me  is 
Rita, R-I-T-A, Levine Hi
lton. And she for a time 
lived, for a long time lived in New York but my
 aunt rema rried. My aunt™s name  was Flora 
Klinnert Kerner.  K-E-R-N-E-R.  and she ma rried
 a gentlema n here  by the name  of Adi n, A-D-I-
N so her name  the last 40 years after they came
 here until she died. Anyw
ay they were married 
over 40 years.  Wa s Flora Adin, A-D-I-N. She was a de
ntist also.  I have a feeling that  that  kept 
her from being exterminated because  she could  te
nd to patients that had from what she told us 
horrible diseases in the mouth beca
use of ma lnutrition, et cetera.  And they tried the Germans, t o 
for the Red Cross anyway for people who came to 
put up an appearance that they were doing all 
that they could, quote unquote. Of course that
 was all nonsense.  My cousin Rita Hilton™s 
testimony is on file at the US Holocaust Museum
 as well as Shoah. She gave testimony to Shoah 
also. Her testimony is or will be vi able.  
 

Q: I think we ™re going to pause now and change tape. 
  

Interview with JuttaLevy
 56 
 
(file 3 Œ RG-50.106.0077.03.03 Œ duration: 25:04) 
 

Esther Finder: This is tape 3, side A an interv
iew with Jutta Le vy for the US Holocaust me morial 
museum.  You had just told me about your talk
 with your cousin when she told you of her 
experiences in the Holocaust and I wa nted to
 ask you how wa s the news of the death camps 
presented in this country, in the American me dia? 

 

Jutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels.
  And which most everyone at this point has 
seen. That™s all we had at the time , well th
at™s all you have. How was it presented. It wa s 
presented graphically and with certa
in amount of disbelief. I think th
e disbelief is to this day. The 
disbelief. Not that people didn™t believe it. But my
 god in heaven, how could this have happened.  
Virtually under our noses. How could such a thin
g have happened?   Never did my fa mily or I 
ever, ever become  used to seeing those pictures 
or  those images. They we
re shown here not just 
by the news me dia, in the news and in the movies
. Didn™t have television, ju
st yet. But it was not 
easy to take.  It really was very  difficult but the main thing was how
 was it that this governme nt, 
you™re talking about the American governme nt, 
how is it that this c
ould have happened. How 
was it that they didn™t know. A
nd if they did know why didn™t 
they do more to help?   Why 
didn™t™ they put a stop to it?   
As though that was so easy. But th
ese are questions that bubbled up.  
There was a certain amount of anger amongst pe
ople like, like us.  How could this have 
happened. Ok we didn™t know about it.  Or we di
dn™t™ have as much of a clue as ma ybe the 
governme nts didn™t.   What did they do?  Why wa
s it allowed to happen?  There was anger. There 
is anger today about the very same thing becau
se we™re finding out more and more and more. 
we™re still finding out. These atrocities that we h
eard about and then saw in the news, newsreels, 

Interview with JuttaLevy
 57 
 
atrocities that my generation, my parents™ genera
tion and people of their, of the generation before 
have never even dreamt of, could not even visuali
ze other than for the pictures. Anger, sadness.  
Disbelief, just as when my cousin sat and talked
 to me .  I don™t™ think I said a word.  For two, 
better than two hours and believe me , if you knew 
me  it™s not easy for me not to talk.  I was 
totally in shock at hearing that some thing like
 this went on and the world stood by. And now as 
an old woman I have to say how could the worl
d have stood by.  I didn™
t™ understand it then, I 
don™t™ understand it now. 

 

Q:  Can you ma ke a distinction in your mi
nd. I asked you what the Americans thought and you 
responded to me  but was that a general respons
e for the American people or perhaps was it a 
response from the Jewish community.  Do you ha
ve a sense of I hope I™m ma king my question 
clear.  Do you have a sense of whether it was the 
general public in the United
 States that had that 
response or was it perhaps a Jewish 
response that you just described. 
 

A: We ll I think primarily it was a 
Jewi sh response.  However I wa
s still in school. And at that 
point, 45, 46, I was on my way to college, so 
I was there was a mi x I™ m talking about younger 
people and also older people.  I have to say that
 the people that we were
 associating with and I 
include us as a fa mily I would say that that  was a universal  attitude.  How could this have 

happened. how.  Si mple as that, or as compli
cated as that.  How could it have happened? 

 

Q:  Do you follow the Nuremberg trials? 

 

A: Did I follow it?  Some what, yes.  Yeah.   

Interview with JuttaLevy
 58 
 
 
Q: What were you reactions to the tr
ials and what came out of them.  
 

A:  Horror.  Horror. I have to be honest with
 you.  To begin, not to 
begin with, some  of I 

couldn™t, I personally had a hard time even having
 listened to what my cousin had to say, some  

of the things that came  out, I had a very hard
 time listening to. I had a 
very hard time  watching 
the visuals, very hard time .  Because they ar
e so horrific. My reaction, you don™t want to know 
what I think about what, well they
 never got a chance to really 
punish. What they should have 
done to these people   there is, I 
have no answer for it. I really don™
t. there isn™t anything that I 
can think of that reflect of what
, how some  of these or all of 
these criminals should have been 
punished. There isn™t a punishment.  
And I don™t know what, I don™t know. 

 

Q:  Did you and your friends ever 
talk about the  Nuremberg tria
ls while they were happening? 
 

A:  You know if I talk to people like myself, ye
s. If I talked to Amer
icans not as much.  You 
know when you™re young, you™re in college  by that 
time , its™, it™s not going to be the topic of 
conversation. You know people turn
 away. They don™t want, the average whether they™re Jewish 
or not they just don™t want to be, they don™t want 
to think too much about 
these things. but I have 
to tell you some thing, I myself was s
till in the process of, want to be
 accepted, I want to be like 
the rest. How much on that, of that can I, can 
I personally focus on.  The general interest was 

there but overall after 
five mi nutes, ten mi nutes of convers
ation it was over with, on to other 
things.

Q: I™m going to get back to that. I have one more 
question then I want to get back to just that 
point.  Did you follow the events 
of partition of Pa lestine anyway? 
 
A: Yeah we did, I did. I was aware of it. When 
you say follow, I didn™t read every word on it but 
I was very much aware of what was going on an
d ultimately the independence. I mi ght add a 
little PS.  MY cousin Rita and I went down to 
the what was then the counselor embassy, Israeli 
when independence was declared and she and I we
re even in a huge group 
picture together.  But 
yes I followe d the creation of the state of Israel
, the partition, you know all that went on, yeah 
followed it. Wa s interested. Wa s thrilled when 
independence came.  Beca
use I felt along with 
ma ny other, I can speak for myself I felt my God, the Jews now have a homeland. Not  that I 

wanted to go there to live.  I was perfectly
 content here.  But we now have a homeland, 
some thing that we didn™t have when we needed it the most.  

 
Q: Now I want to get back to what you were sa
ying before.  From your pe rspective as a refugee 
that had come  to the united St
ates could you see what effect 
there mi ght have been on the 
American Jewish community as a 
result of the Holocaust . And the 
Nuremberg trials and the birth 
of the state of Israel.  Did you 
see any changes in the Jewish 
community from when you first 
arrived. 
 

A: That™s a very tough question because you know  
for as ma ny people as there are  and as ma ny 
people as I knew not that it is that ma ny, but
 you get different reactions. Totally different 
reactions.  This, I have to tell you amongst a lot of
 people and Jews too ther
e™s a lot of apathy.  I 
think that™s the right word. The war was over, si
x million Jews plus perished.  What a horribl e, 

Interview with JuttaLevy

horrible thing. Now this Is years back.  we™re talk
ing from, you™re asking 
me  about that. Terrible. 
It must never happen again. I don™t™
 really think that it all sank
 in.  There are too many things 
happening. Sa me  with the state of Israel.  That th
ere are your true Zionists who absolutely were 
thrilled. My father one of them. 
Thrilled with the fact that th
ere was a state of Israel. But you 
also found a lot of ok it™s done, let™
s get on with it type of attitude
.  And the rami fications of all 
what we™ve been talking about the last few mi nut
es, didn™t™ really come  to a, well there™s no 
concluding cause nothi ng is over.  But the 
full impact didn™t come  til ma ny, ma ny, many years 
later. I would say as recently 
as 15 years ago, 20 years ago.  That
 people really began well when 
those survivors started speaking. Th
ey haven™t been talki
ng all that long. I for 
one started to talk 
about my own experience when my kids got real
ly involved in their hi
gh schools, at Blair High 
school. The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has 

a mother or father that  is survived the Hitler regime that was fr om Poland or Germany or 

Roma nia, or Russia or whatever. And the only on
e in the class that raised their hand was my 
daughter.   Shannon. And the teacher said well sh
e asked about me  and my daughter was told her 
that oh yes my mo m wa s born in Hamburg Germany 
and she lived under Hitl
er for si x years. My 
four year old grandchildren when they were at
 that age that this Gr
andma came from Ha mburg 
Germany.  Ha mburger Germany.  Anyway she said 
my, told her that the mo m that she was born 
in Hamburg Germany, ca me  over here and the teac
her said would your mo ther be interested in 
talking and my daughter says I don™t™ know.  Anyway
 teacher called me . And I did talk to all the 
classes during that year of that and then, and then
 the teacher.   I don™t kn
ow if the same teacher 
did, I did it for my younger daught
er also  when she four years later followed. But you know up 
until except for isolated cases, do you know they di
dn™t™ speak.  The survivors did not  speak if 

Interview with JuttaLevy

you want to call me  a survivor.  Or a refugee, it 
really doesn™t™ ma tter. Bu
t we didn™t talk about 
it. Who wanted to hear it? 
 

Q: Tell me  about your life since the end of th
e war, about your personal life, your professional 
life?  

 

A:  We ll as I told you in the beginning we fluffed 
over that quickly. I went to work at the age of 
14.  First for others. I won™t™ even begin to 
tell you all the things 
that I™ve done. But then 
primarily for my father in his business.  I work
ed hard. I worked with both my parents.  My 
father got sick early on so I ran a business.  I have
 to say that. I ran a business.  I got ma rried in 
1952.  We  held onto that business. My father was 
very ill, required, he could never get the  
proper life insurance because of his hypertension. 
We , he had the best of care. we tried very 

much, very hard to keep him going but he died at
 55. He accomplished a lot in a very short time .  
Married off two daughters in st
yle, college educated, two da
ughters at George Wa shington 
University. Had a home . lived we
ll, way beyond his means. So by the time he died we were 
pretty well tapped out. So but we rebounded. My
 husband went to work for the governme nt. I 
went to work for various people.  In the jewelry 
business, in the travel business, in a doctor™s 
office. Too ma ny things to name . We™ve had and 
I have a, we always have even when my 
parents were alive  a nice
 life, pleasant. Problems yes.  Always
 struggling a bit.  A lot, a bit.  
Looking back on everything and I hope there™s moreto come  it™s been ok. it™s been fine.  I™m a 

Yankee Doodle American.  I reflect ma ny ti me s on my
 life over there.  And how fortunate I was, 
we were to have gotten out when we did.  Becau
se but for the grace of God we would not have 
been here.

Q: Are you affiliated with any survivor groups or  organizations? 

 

A:  Yes I am. With the Holocaust survivors a
nd friends. I™m a me mber and it™s through their 
auspices that I do whatever speaking I do.  Prim
arily at the US Capital Children™s museum and 
whoever wants me .  I™ve also been involved in
 the US Holocaust Museum, although not I™m not 
a volunteer there because believe it 
or not I still work a 
little bit.  So ther e™ s just  so ma ny things 
in the week and I feel that giving my  
talks and I am contributing some thing.  
 

Q: Have you ever been back to Hamb urg? 

 

A: Yes I have. 

 
Q:  Can you tell me  what  that experience was like? 
 

A: I have to tell you that on my
 own I  wouldn™t™ have gone. Had I not been invited and the trip 
been paid for I wouldn™t have gone
. The city of Ha mburg has invi
ted people like mys e lf back 
and two years ago my husband  and I went as gues
ts, everything paid for. What was that like?   
The day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment. And we took the subway whatever. 

I knew exactly where to get off.  It™s amazing how
 everything came back. I saw the apartment, I 
saw ultimately the sc hool where I went.  Not the pub
lic sc hool, the pr ivate school. I went into the 
building, into the apartment. I went into the back
 yard where I had to be so quiet.  During our 
recess.  We nt to the downtown branch of the school
, saw what was left of 
my synagogue.  That™s 

Interview with JuttaLevy

unusual that that façade is standing. The only thing th
at rema ins of it is  th
e front of it because it 
was granite and it had been relatively newly bui
lt.  They couldn™t burn granite.   The Hebrew 
lettering is there and I have 
pictures of that. Wha t  was my
 you asked me  what was my 
impression going back. The area that I lived in 
wa s not bombed or harmed so basically it was 
some what frozen in time . The downtown area ha
s was compl e tely bombed and rebuilt. It™s a 
very rich city moneywise.  Pros, prosperous is a 
better word.  I did get to 
see some special places 
that we used to go to. I also 
had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Berge n Belsen 
where to me  that™s like a cemetery because people
  that I knew and loved I think pe rished there. 
I™m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her 
mother had survived it. it™s been sanitized. It™s 
become like a me morial and I will say that the 
Germans do visit there because they have very 
few Jews in Ha mburg. Very few.  Bergen Belsen
 is about two hours outsi
de of Ha mb urg which I 
didn™t even know. Between Hambur g and Hanover. I di
dn™t know that.  Til 
I got there.  I™ve  
forgotten that you asked me . The overall impressi
on.  I was sad.  When I  left the plane took off 
and I looked down at the city where I was born an
d I was sad and I cried, the only time  I cried. 
Oh I shouldn™t™ say that. I did cry in the back 
yard of the school because it hadn™t changed. But 
when we left I cried.  Why?  I was born there. 
I grew up there.  What 
I felt they took away my 
childhood.  I had realized it before
 but it didn™t™ impact me  as  much as, my husband was sitting 
next to me on the plane. And it didn™t impact 
me until I left. They took away my childhood. They 
did and for that and that™s a small ma ybe price to pa
y in view of what others lost but don™t forget 

I lost my family too.  But I wasn™t™ in a camp. I 
didn™t starve.  We  were 
very dirt poor when we 
fi rst came to New York.  All that  was do-able and 
bear-able.  But we™re talking about me  talking 
about me  and how this whole part of history 
impacted me  yeah it did. They took away my 
childhood. They took away what mi ght have been 
for me , education wise.  Many things.  And 

Interview with JuttaLevy

once I got that out of my system on the plane go
ing from Ha mburg to Frankfurt, I became  sad.  
While I was there I wasn™t even sad, other than
 various you know just mo me nts here, mome nts 
there.  Because we were kept busy. But then refl
ecting. I have reflected a lot since I came  back. I 
was cheated also.  Cheated. It was, they took aw
ay a chunk of my life, a big chunk.  And I think 
it has impacted me, the way I act, the way I thi
nk and the way I behave, even into my 70s. And 
I™m starting to fill up and I don™t™ want to. It™s sad.  
 

Q: IS there anything that you™d lik
e to add before we conclude. 
 

A: Maybe the only think I™d like 
to say. I know that what I™ve gone
 through doesn™t™ begin to tell 
a whole story, doesn™t™ be gin to compare to so 
many thousands but I have survived the millions 
that were killed. It doesn™t™ compare.  If I can 
teach anything or say some th
ing that will have an 
impact other than the few things I™ve said on this
 tape,  don™t™ take anything for granted.  Don™t 
take your freedom for granted, don™t take anyt hing 
for granted because it can
 change. Be grateful 
for what you have here.  Who™s ev
er listening to this. This is th
e greatest country on earth.  Not 
perfect. There is nothing perfect. This is not 
a perfect world but here you have as close to 
perfection  as it™s going to get. It
™s not going to get any better. So
 don™t™ take it for granted, love 
your country. Vote, support it, work for it, enjoy 
it and keep it free. Keep
 it free. Thank you very 
much. 

 

Q: And thank you for doing the interview a
nd this now concludes the interview.
