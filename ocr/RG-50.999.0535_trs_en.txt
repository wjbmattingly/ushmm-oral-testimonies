the arrow indic ates  the loc ation of Doks zyc e.  As par t of an agr eement 
with Nazi Germ any, the Soviet Union oc c upied Doks zyc e in September
 
1939.  Ger m any invaded the 
Soviet Union in 1941.  When Germ an SS and police began mas s killings  of the J ews  in Doks zyc e in 
1942, Rac hel and her family went into hiding.  A s hor t time later, Rac hel's br other was  dis c overed by 
the Germans and kil

Baltimore Hebr ew College at night.
 
 
Rae m arried Harvey Goldfar b, a Holoc aus t s urviv or  and a U.S. Ar my veteran of the Korean 
War, r ight after  he left the Arm y.  They have been m arr ied 63 year s .
  
She went back to the c ourt after

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, thank  you for joining us  today and for your willingness  to be our
 
Firs t Per s on
.  
Thank  you ver y m uc h.  We have s o m uc h for you to s hare with us  and jus t one s hort hour s o we
 
will 
jum p r ight in.
 
 
Befor e you tell us  about what happened in your  family dur ing the war  dur ing the Holoc aus t, 
let's  s tar t with you telling us  a little bit about your  family and your  c omm unity in the years  befor e the war 

began.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  My fam il
y was  quite well
-
to
-
do.  Both m y par ents were in bus ines s .  My mother had a 
yard good s tore.  Clothing was  made by every family.  Ther e was  no depar tm ent s tor es
, n
o ready
-
m ade 
wear .  So bus iness was pr etty brisk. 
 
 
My father had a dual busines s .  We lived s o c los e to the border . We wer e four kilometers  
fr om  the Rus s ian
-
P olis h b
or der and there was  a militar y g
arr is on, barr ack s , near by.  And my father  
s upplied them with meat.  And he als o s upplied them  with s ome other produc ts .  He als o exported 

s om e of the 
pr oducts  through Ger many, of all plac es .
 
 
Both my parents wer e well traveled.  They tr aveled on bus ines s.  My mother to Vilna, to 
Wars aw, to Lodz
; m
y father to the Germ an
-
Polis h bor der.  They had a ver y c los e relations hip with a lot 
of the villager s  ar ound
 
the area bec ause of their bus ines s .  They knew a lot of the people there.
 
 
My father died before the Ger m ans  c am e in.  He came back  from a trip to deliver goo
ds  to the 
Germ an bor der in late 1937.  He c am e back with s om e s ort of an infection that the doctors  c ould not 
identify.  They did not have the m odern medic ine nor the modern antibiotics  and he pas s ed away.  He 

didn't go thr ough the hor ror s  of the Holoc aust.

My m other c ontinued with her bus ines s  and m y father's  bus ines s loc ally.  The Rus s ians  
oc c upied
 
Poland in 1939.  She had to c los e her  bus ines s .  She distributed a lot of
 
the fabric s  to families  
in t
he area, to villagers  in the area
,  
bec aus e s he didn't want the c omm unis ts  to take it away. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you c ontinue with telling us  about what it was  like under  the Comm unist 
oc c upation, just a c ouple of other  questions.  How large was  your  extended fam ily? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  My m other was  one of eight.  Her  s is ters  and brother s  all had fam ilies .  I don't even 

know the num ber .  I'm luc ky to remember her brother s and s ister s' names.  I don't r emember my 
c ous ins ' nam es.  Too long ago.  I s hould have written them down.  But, you know, hinds ight is  better 
than for esight.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In your fam ily
,  
education was  s tar ted.  You
 
started your education at a very young age.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  My father was  ins trum ental in starting a private s c hool, a Hebrew s c hool, bas ic ally, 

to teac h the m oder n Hebr ew language.  They needed a num ber of students .  I was  enrolled at the age 
of 3.  I had a gover nes s  befor e that s o I was  familiar  with the alphabet and c ould keep up with the 
classes.  
Sc hool was  not
 
--
 
c hildren were not expos ed to s c hool in Poland until the age of 7.  So I was  
way ahead of the gam e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e way ahead.  
 
 
Did you in your  s mall town, did you have interac tions  with the Chris tian population? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  My family had a lot of inter actions .  I don't k now about other families .  I even 

r em em ber s pending Chr is tmas  Eve helping to dec orate a Chr istmas  tr ee in
 
one of the families  that 
eventually m y brother  was  plac ed with.
  
I don't r em em ber  m uc h.  I rem ember  m aking ornam ents  out of 
eggs.  We would blow out the egg, make a hole in one end, hole in the ear, blow to get the c ontents 
out, and then m ake a string and
 
draw a fac e on it.  I r em ember that. 
 
 
I r em ember going to c hur c h with my br other and his
 
--
 
the woman that took  c ar e of him.  Both 
our  parents wer e in bus ines s  and we needed help in the hous e.  So I knew all the intric ac ies  of what
 
to
 
do in a c hur c h.  That, of c our s e, helped later  on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se, Nazi Germ any attacked Poland Septem ber
 
1, 1939, starting WorldWar II.  
The Soviets attacked Poland from the east on September
 
17.  And that's when your c omm unity c am e 
under Soviet oc cupation.  You s tar ted to tell us what life was like under the Soviets .
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Life had a big c hange bec ause religion was  kind of s hunned.  People s till attended 

their religious
-
affiliated hous es  of wors hip but it was
 
--
 
they had to do it m ore dis c r etely.  Ther e was  a 
lot of looting by the Rus sian s oldier s .  I r emem ber m y father had br ought a m oder n alarm c lock, a c loc k  

that was  s tanding on a counter, and a s oldier picked it up and tried to fas ten it to his wr is t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like a watc h.
 
> > Rae Goldfarb:  Like a watc h.  They were looking for  watc hes , of c ourse.  That's  the s m all stuff that 
was  hidden fr om them.
 
 
My m other always  told the s tor y about s he had brought som e night gowns , night wear, from 
pr obably one of the large c ities .  They were s ilk .  They looked like dr es s es to the Rus s ian wom en.  
They wore them  in the s tr eet. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  You k now, c hildr en r em em ber  funny s tories.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I remem ber c orrec tly, you s aid that the Rus sians  thought of your  family as  b
ourgeoi
s 
and there was s om e wor ry you had that you would ac tually end up in Siber ia.  And then later
 
--
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We wis h
ed
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wished you had ended up in Siber ia.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  The Rus s ians , in order to c onfis c ate ever ything that the wealthier people had, they 
c am e up with a progr am of depor tation.  They would tell them
 
--
 
they wouldn't even tell them .  They 
would c ome in and s ay, "Pac k  your s uitc as e and com e."  They would c om e at night.
  
When that 
bec ame k nown, in m y hous e ther e was
 
always  a s uitc as e c los e by with s om e item s.  We k new Siber ia 
was  very c old, jus t fr om the wor d Siber ia.  So we wer e hoping to be
 
--
 
we were hoping not to be 
deported.  We didn't know the Ger mans wer e going to c om e.  And s inc e m y mother was  a widow at 

that
 
tim e, we were the las t on the lis t.  Sever al fam ilies  were deported.  Som e s ur vived.  Som e didn't.  

4 
 
We wer e not deported.  Now, of c ours e, we wis h we were m aybe.  Maybe s ome of us  would have 
s ur vived Siberia.  Who knows ?
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e you able to c ontinue educ ation under the Rus s ians ? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Yes .  Sc hool was  open. We wer e allowed to go to s c hool.  My mother had a private 
tutor  at hom e for our Hebrew s tudies .  So m y educ ation c ontinued.  I was  fortunate enough that I was  
not put in the gr ade by age but I was  put in the grade by progr ess .  So I actually had a little m or e 

education than s om ebody m y age would have gotten by that age. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se, things would c hange dram atic ally in J une
 
1941 when Ger m any turned on 
the Soviets  and attacked the Soviet Union.  The German Ar my enter ed your  town in the late s ummer of 
1941.  I believe by the end of 1941, Germ ans
 
--
 
the Ger mans
 
--
 
the Nazis for c ed you and the other 
J ews  of your  town into a ghetto.  What do 
you 
r ecall of what happened when the Ger mans  c am e in and 
being for c ed into the ghetto? 
 

> > Rae Goldfar b:  I r emember the tank s  c oming in.  I rem em ber the German s oldiers  were throwing 
c andy at the population.  They c am e in as vic tors .  Of c ours e, the firs t im pres s ion nobody thought
 
what 
followed would c ome.
 
 
The only r eas on we knew that things wer e going to get bad is  m y grandparents lived at the 
edge of town
 
--
 
we lived in the c enter of town.  If you know of any sm all towns , you know Main Street 
was  the important pla
c
e to live.  And our hous e was  on a main s treet, the main thor oughfare.  It was  a 

lar ge hous e.  The bus iness es  were in fr ont.  The hous e was  in the back of the bus ines s es.  It was  
gated off.  The yar d was  gated off.  It was  a long hous e.  I r emem ber that.  And ther e was  a war ehous e 
r ight next to it.  That was  the boundary
, a
nd the yar d and the ar ea with the large gate.
 
 
The Rus s ians  had put a fam ily into our  hous e.  They evic ted one of the fam ilies  that wer e 
better off and took  over  their r es idenc e for  their  own us e and 
they m oved them into m y family's  hous e.
 
The only r eas on we becam e awar e of the Germ an oc c upation was  not going to be an eas y one 
bec aus e my gr andfather rem em bered the German oc c upation of the Sec ond Wor ld War
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om the Fir s t Wor ld War.
 
>
>  Rae Goldfarb:  The Fir s t Wor ld War.  Thank  you.  And they wer e very c ivilized.  But he saw one of 
the offic ers , and he r ec ognized him  as s om ebody that was  s tationed in his hous e.  He lived at the edge 
of town.  And this  partic ular  gentlem an and s ome other s oldiers wer e stationed in his  hous e.  He tried to 
appr oac h him .  He waved him  off.  From what m y m other told me, that kind of s unk  into m y m em ory, is  
that he c am e and warned my gr andfather.  He s aid
, ﬁT
his A r my is n't
 
like the old A rm y.  
If you want to 
s
peak  to me, you c an't do it on the street.  Make a s ign and I'll c ome and s peak
 
to
 
you but I will not be 
able to c onvers e with you on the street."  And that gave us the fir st inc lination that things wer en't going 

to be good. 
 
 
It was  ear ly in the war .  The
 
fr ontlines  wer e m oving at a ver y fast pac e.  The Rus s ians  were 
r etreating.  And the Germ an Ar my jus t couldn't m ove fast enough.  The oc c upation was a lot differ ent 

than it was in s om e of the other c ities in Poland.  The Nazis  were not quite organized in their pr ogr am s .
 
Shor tly after they oc c upied our area and as they wer e m oving on, they started to take c ontr ol of the 
J ewis h population.  They form ed a ghetto.  
 
 
We c an't s how
 
--
 
> > Bill B ens on:  No.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Ok .  They form ed a ghetto within an area.  Our hous e happened to have fallen into 
the area of the ghetto.  They s elec ted an area where the s ynagogues  were bec aus e ther e was  an 
organized
 
--
 
you know, the s ynagogues were organized around a plaza.  There was a s pac e in 
between.  Like a park  here. 
 
I don't know.  You don't have any
 
--
 
I gues s  in s mall towns  you s till don't 
have any c hurc hyards  that ar e big but there were about four, five s ynagogues .  There were between 

2,500 and 3,000 J ews  in the town.  It was  a pretty s izeable town.  Ther e were about 6,000 inhabitants .  
And that is  within the town proper .  So they s elec ted that ar ea.
 
 
One of the boundar ies  was  a r iver .  It was  c alled the Berezina.  Mos t of the hous es  on the 
fr ont had gates.  So they had a natural boundar y.  And the back  of the ghetto was  fenc ed, barbed
-
wir e 
fenc e.
 

5 
 
 
The ghetto was  not like what you think of a ghetto, being an ar ea wher e a c ertain group or 
c er tain population lives .  It was  bas ically like a jail.  They had guar ds.  We c ould not go in and out at 
leis ure.  The only t
ime people c ould go out
 
--
 
not even go out but open the gates in the front and 
interm ingle was  on m ark et day s o that the farm ers  c ould sell their  goods to anybody who had anything 

to barter  or had any m oney.  But the Germ ans  took  c are of that, too. 
 
The gh
etto was  organized where 
they s ort of s aid you're going to rule your s elf.  They appointed a c ommis s ioner.  You under stand.  They 
appointed a c omm ittee. 
 
 
They took  a num ber of people out to work.  They would as k  the able
-
bodied population to 
c om e to this  
open area and they would s elec t workers  for their  needs.  Sinc e the barracks were nearby 
and they needed
 
--
 
tr anspor tation was  m ostly by hor s e and buggy.  There were very few automated 
vehic les .  So they needed c ooks and laundres s es, and people to tak e c ar
e of the hor s es  and to c lean 
the stalls  and to s hine their boots.  So they would take a certain s egm ent of population out to wor k , 
c ount them, of c ours e, and bring them back  c ounting them, too.
  
At one point when it bec ame 
apparent
 
--
 
you know what happens
 
when you'r e jailed?  You tr y to think of whic h way to get out of 
ther e.  So a few of the men on the way bac k  fr om work  took off.  They didn't take off s o they c ould s ee 

them
;  
they would s hoot them.  But bas ic ally they s tole a way.  
 
 
When they c am e back  and it was  c ounted, it was  found that s om e wer e mis s ing.  Ther e were 
ac tually four  that were mis s ing.  They didn't know about one s o they thought ther e wer e only thr ee 

bec aus e s om ebody when they s tarted to c ount, som ebody s lipped in to make the c ount. 
  
The
 
r etr ibution was  10
-
for
-
1.  They asked the c om mittee to s elec t 30 people as r epr imand for the es c apees .  
The c omm ittee offered them s elves .  They wouldn't take them.  They asked them to ac tually s elec t 

people of s im ilar age to be the s c apegoats , I gues s  you
 
would c all them .
  
Fr om what I lear ned later, 
they lined them up and m achined them down.  They killed them r ight in front of everybody.  Of c our s e, 
that intimidation m ade people think twic e before tr ying to es c ape.
 
 
It was  als o apparent, at that time, it was  als o learned, that Rus s ian s oldiers
 
--
 
bas ic ally they 
didn't want to fight.  They laid down their arms and thought that they would bec om e pris oner s  of war  
and they would be fed and they would s omehow es c ape the fighting at the fr ontlines .  However, they
 
were very poorly tr eated.  It bec ame appar ent to them  that they would not s ur vive.  They were not fed 
bec aus e s upplies  were short.  They did not tr ans port them  by any kind of m eans  other than walking.  
Their s hoes were tor n.  Their  c lothing was  tor n.  They were c old.  This  was  getting c los er to winter.  So 
they tr ied to 
es
c ape.  Thos e in the front, of c ourse, m anaged to es c ape.  Thos e in the back  got s hot or  
wounded.  They left the wounded lying ther e.  They would not r em ove the bodies .  Gues s who they put
 
to removing the bodies .  The J ewis h population. 
 
 
As ide fr om that, they also c ollec ted r ans om .  They would ask  the c omm ittee to s upply a 
c er tain amount of m oney, a c ertain am ount
, j
ewelry, gold, silver .  It cam e down to where they wer e 
even c ollecting bras s  and iron.  Everything for the war effort.
 
 
As  the fr ontlines moved on
 
--
 
s hould I continue? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about
 
--
 
you told me that they began what you c alled to dim inis h the ghetto.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  That's what I was  going to
 
--
 
they s tar ted what they c alled a r es ettlem ent
t
o shr ink  
the ghetto.  They s aid they wer e going to tak e the J ews  to a larger ghetto bec aus e the frontlines  were 

s o c los e, s upposedly for our s afety. 
 
They s elec ted a c er tain num ber of J ews .  It bec ame apparent who 
they selec ted.  They started to s elect s om e young and s ome s eniors  for res ettlement.  And we found 

out later  that they were taking them  to a pit and bas ic ally exec uting them. 
 
 
So the ghetto was  s hrunk .  My m other started to wor ry about what would happen.  In ou
r 
house we had a hiding plac e.  Ther e was  a s pac e between the wall of the hous e and the war ehouse.  It 

was  us ed in pr evious  year s , too, as  a hiding place bec aus e of the war s  that were going on.  It was  als o 
us ed by m y par ents as  sort of like a s afe. We didn't have an iron s afe.  This  was  the s afe, to keep 
s om e things  that were of value.  The only ac c es s  was  thr ough the attic.  You had to c limb up and go in 
ther e.
  
When it was  appar ent that the ghetto
 
--
 
that they were trying to what they c alled the res ettl
ement 
again, we went into hiding.  We went into that wall, into the s pac e between the walls .

There was  a s ec ond s or t of s hrinkage of the ghetto.  We c am e out.  There was  no plac e to go, 
no way to es c ape.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you would hide in ther e
,  
the
r e were s ever al of you in this ver y s m all s pac e.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Oh, yeah.  As  m any as  c ould get in. 
 
 
When the ghetto was  s hrunk  to s uc h a point that it bec ame s o s mall
 
--
 
we didn't have that 
m uc h time already to hide.  So the only people that wer e able
 
to get in
 
--
 
and bas ic ally, fr om what my 
m other  told m e, we s lept c los e to the entr y into the hiding plac e.  We didn't s leep anym or e.  In the 
ghetto we s lept acros s  the bed bec aus e there wer e s o many people to start with.  Then when ghetto 
got smaller, of
 
c ours e, we had a little m or e s pac e but we didn't s leep in our  beds anymor e.  We s lept 
c los e to the entr y to this  hiding plac e. 
 
 
With the last
 
--
 
when they finally
 
--
 
the final
 
--
 
what they c alled the final clos ing of the ghetto, 
we managed
 
--
 
it c am e on 
ver y quickly. We didn't expec t it
.  T
her e was  no warning at all.  We heard 
the knocking on the doors .  They didn't even take anybody to the plaza.  The other ones they asked the 

people to c ome out to be c ounted.  But this time there was  no c ounting.  They
 
s tarted to bang on the 
door s  and asked everybody to c ome out.  It was  the m iddle of the night.  We c limbed into this  hiding 

plac e.  
 
 M
y m other, my br other  and I, m y grandm other
 
--
 
m y gr andfather was  alr eady taken.  And 
about three other  c hildren managed to get in.  Befor e the door s were br ok en down.
  
We heard the 
looting. We heard the s earc hing.  My mother was  very well
-
known.  Everybody wanted to know
 
--
 
the 
ones  that c ame to loot
 
--
 
wher e we wer e.  She had jewelry, s he had this, she had that.  Where is
 
it?  
They s tarted to br eak things in the hous e, car ry things  out, arguing.
  
 
 
This  was  going on for about s even or eight days .  It was  get getting quiet.  I gues s m os t of the 
things wer e alr eady taken fr om the hous e.  It was  c leared out.  We thought we c ould get out and try to 

es c ape.
  
It was  nighttim e.  We m anaged to get out. We thought we wer e going to tr y to r un for it
 b
ut 
obvious ly s om ebody was s till in the hous e.  There was  another hiding plac e nearby.  My mother pus hed 

us  into the hiding plac e.  She
 
went in and the two c hildr en went in that were out ther e.  My gr andmother 
was  to c ome after us.  But the voic es  bec am e very c los e and s om ebody said, "Ther e's s omebody."  So 

s he quickly c over ed the hiding s pac e and she acted c r azy.  It mus t have been popul
ation that c aught 
her  becaus e they c alled the Nazis  and they took  her  away. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your gr andm other.  They took your  grandmother away.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We stayed in that plac e throughout the day and I don't know how muc h longer.  We 

had no food
 
at that time.  Sanitation was  im pos s ible.  It was  quiet.  My m other s aid we've got to make a 
r un for it.  She knew what to do.  Let's put it this  way, she knew where to go.  And we went for the r iver 
bec aus e s he figured the r iver  would be the leas t guar de
d.
 
 
We cr os s ed the river  and enc ountered two guards.  They wer e loc al people that were given 
guns to guard the ghetto.  My m other r ec ognized them.  They r ec ognized her.  She told them, "I have 
s om e jewelr y with me and I'll be happy to give it to you.  Put your
 
r ifles  on your s houlder s .  J us t let m e 
and m y c hildr en go." 
 
 
She had one of thos e
 
--
 
it was  like a m en's watc h on a gold c hain.  She gave it to one.  She 
wr apped it around his  hand.  She s aid, "Don't los e it.  It's ver y valuable."  The other  one s he gave
 
some 
loos e
 
--
 
s he s ays , "Put out your  hands."  They did.  And as s oon as  s he emptied her pockets, we ran. 
 
The two c hildren that wer e with us  ran in one direc tion.  We ran in a differ ent dir ection.  She s ays 
ever ybody s c atter
 
bu
t s he told us wher e to r un.
  
And, of c our s e, 
we wer e too young to k now where s o
 
we kind of r an with her.
 
 
We went to the hous e
 
--
 
I told you about dec or ating a tree.  Very good friends .  We would play 
with their c hildr en all the tim e. We were very fr iendly with them.  He agr eed to 
keep m y brother.  He 
had a little boy that was  about the s am e age.  So my mother  left my br other with him  for s afe keeping.  

And s he went to another hous e.  She told him where we wer e going.  She was  hoping to plac e m e with 
that fam ily. 
 
 
We wer e at the s e
c ond house not ver y long when s om ebody c ame fr om that other hous ehold 
wher e m y brother was  
--
 
I think  s he was  a s is ter.  I don't know whether  the wife was  a s is ter or his  

7 
 
s is ter.  They beat up the fellow that was  hiding m y br other ver y badly.  They found a
 
J ew there.  
Needles s  to s ay it bec am e ver y apparent what had happened.
  
We found out later that his own 
m other
-
in
-
law had c alled the Nazis  on him .  They took m y brother away.  And the wom an where we 
were gave us  s om e br ead and told us to go hide.  She told us  where to go hide.  She s aid s he will 
c om e when it gets dark  and s he will tell us  what happened. 
 
We did.  We ran and we hid.
 
 
I r em ember what it was .  It was  a bathhous e, a s tone building.  Ther e wer e no s howers  and 
baths  in the hous es , believe it or  not.  The bathhouse was  the plac e where people went, us ually befor e 

the weekend.  In or der  to go to c hur c h, they would c lean up and put on s ome Sunday c lothes.  She told 
us  go there bec aus e nobody is  going to be us ing it for the next few days .  I don't even know what day of 
the week  it was .
  
We stayed ther e.  She c am e the next night and br ought us  s ome food and told us  they 
took m y brother away
 a
nd
,  
fr om  what s he hear d, he was  s hot.  She told us  not to stay bec aus e they 
were looking for us . 
 
So we s tarted t
o tr y to get away.
 
 
The woman that took c are of m y br other was  the one that m y mother thought of next bec aus e 
s he was  like a m ember  of the fam ily.  Unfortunately maybe if we had run to her hous e
 
but s he was  
further away.  It took  us all night to get to her
 
hous e from where we wer e.  She told us  s he's afr aid to 
hide us  bec aus e now that it is  known that my m other  is  escaping, that they would probably c ome to her  

hous e.  But she s aid s he would go to town and s ee if my brother was  s till alive.  She would try to
 
plead 
to give her the c hild bec aus e s he's  c hildles s  and she r ais ed him from  infanc y. 
 
 
We hid in the fields .  The c or n was  pretty high at that point alr eady.  We hid in the fields and 
s he went into town.  She c am e back
 a
t night and told us  that he was  s hot.  She brought us  s om e 
pr ovis ions.  Again, day and night.  The day we hid.  At night we walked. 
 
 
We got to a farm of a woman who was  widowed.  My father helped her keep the farm.  She 
was  Frenc h.  She had no fam ily.  She married this gentleman and c ame to live with him  on his  farm .  It 

was  a r ather  large far m.  She had two c hildr en.  She had a s on and a daughter.  The daughter was  
c los e to my age.  And the s on was  older.  She kept us overnight but s he was  afr aid to keep us  becaus e 
the farmers fr om  adjoini
ng farm s c am e to help her with the c hor es.  Her  s on c ouldn't do them.  She and 
her  son c ouldn't do them all by her self.  The only plac e s he c ould hide us  was  in out buildings  or in her 

hous e.  The farm hous es were bas ic ally one big r oom .  The s leeping quart
ers  wer e only bloc ked off by a 
c ur tain.  So hiding us  in the barn was  diffic ult when you have people c om ing to do the c hor es. 
 
 
The next day was  a market day.  She dr es s ed me in her daughter 's  c lothing.  She dr es s ed my 
m other  in her c lothing.  They loaded the wagon for the market to take the pr oduc e to the m arket.  Her  
s on dr ove the wagon.  She took  a trem endous c hanc e bec aus e if they would c atc h us , they would 
pr obably be put to death, too. 
 
 
We got off in the marketplac e, m ingled for a while with the farmers there.  It was  mor e distant.  
The farm ers  didn't quite know m y m other.  She was  dress ed like one of the farm ers .
  
In the late 
after noon when the people wer e c oming back  from work into the ghetto, we s tole in with them into the 
ghetto.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you returned to another  ghetto.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We went to another ghetto that was  mor e distant with a m uc h bigger town.  There 

was  a little bit of industry there.  They took  the people als o to wor k  in s ome of the indus tr y.
 
 
The Germ ans  were not us ed to the c lim ate of Eastern Europe
 a
nd Rus s ia.  They needed 
s ocks , wool s oc ks, gloves , hats , s c arves , s weaters .  So they put the people in the ghetto to work  
knitting.  They took  people out to wor k .  And they took  people bas ic ally to the s pinning m ills  bec ause 
that's  wher e the yar n
 
--
 
the wool was  being s pun.
 
 
My m other knew s ome people in that ghetto.  Even though they had alr eady s hr unk the ghetto 
s om e, they still had an indus tr y to be able to keep them alive. We needed docum ents.  Ther e was  no 

way to get doc um ents bec aus e ever ybody had s omething to s how that they were in the ghetto.  It jus t 
s o happened that one of the gir ls had been taken away and her paper s  were left at hom e
.  So I was 
m ade older.  I was  really bor n in 1932 but all my paperwor k is 1930.  Bec aus e my mother  want
ed to 
m ake s ur e that I would qualify to go to work.  This was  1942.  Ac c or ding to the paperwork I was  12 

even though I was  only 10. 
 

8 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So
 
at 12 you would be m or e likely to be allowed to work.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Oh, yeah.  They took  12
-
year
-
old gir ls to wor k .  10
-
year
-
old gir ls they had no use for . 
 
So I had a way of going out to work whic h m eant ac c es s  to the outs ide.  My job at the s pinning
 
m ill was 
to tie the threads.  If a thread br oke, you know, fr om  the s pinning, I would have to quickly c atc h the two 
ends and tie them.  My finger s bec am e ver y nimble. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, I know you have s o muc h more to tell us.  In Glebokie, in the ghetto, your mother 
was  deter mined to get out of there.  She wanted to join the partis ans in the fores t.  Tell us  what s he did 
from there. 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  All r ight.  Mother  was  in touc h with s ome of m y father 's  fr iends  through the 
m arketplac e.  Sinc e the J ews  wer e allowed to buy fr om farmers, s he was  able to get in touc h with one 
of the farmers that was  a ver y good fr iend of m y father's  and als o had a lot of fabr ic s  hidden with him.  

And m other told the farmers , us e what you need, s ell what you need, and give me what I need.  
Bas ic ally a barter s ys tem.
 
 
At firs t s he tr ied to organize s omething.  She was  very resourc eful.  She tr ied to organize a 
group to get out of the ghetto.  In or der to be ac cepted by the partis ans , mother  felt that if s he br ought 
along 
s ome people that were of us e to them that we would be ac c epted, too.  And there was  a doctor 
that was  willing to tr y to es c ape.
 
 
A tunnel was  dug under the fenc e.  The group that s he had organized, we were going to try to 
get out thr ough that tunnel and r un for  our lives , of c our s e.  But s omebody got wind of it.  A c ouple of 
guys  went and us ed the tunnel before it was  properly
 
--
 
a gr oup was  proper ly or ganized and organized 
on the outs ide for  s omebody to r ec eive us, s om e of the farm er s that wer e friends  because you couldn't 

r un fas t enough, unles s  you had s ome hor s es  ther e.  They went out and they wer e c aught.  The tunnel 
was  c om pr om is ed.  
 

 
Mother dec ided no more trying to organize anything.  It was  jus t s he and I.  She and her  
daughter.  She was  deter mined
 
s he was  going to s ave her  c hild.  She was n't thinking about s aving 
her s elf. 
 
She got this gun fr om m y father 's friend, a farm er, smuggled to her in a basket of eggs
; 
s traw 
on the bottom, the gun, straw on top, and eggs on top of it.  The Germans were very
 
finic ky
.  They 
wouldn't do anything to dirty their hands  or  to mess  things up.  Any mes s  they didn't like.  So eggs  wer e 

a good thing to c arr y.  You c ould eas ily br eak an egg and they wouldn't tr y to touc h anything.
  
On 
m arket day we wer e dres s ed in the farm er s c lothing and we ventur ed out and we continued on. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: With the basket with the gun in it.
 
>>
 
Rae Goldfar b:  With the basket, the gun ther e. Well, if
 
we wer e caught, it was  death no m atter  how.  
If we r em ained in the ghetto, we knew what would happen to us.  If we wer e c aught on the way, we 

knew what would happen to us .  It was  a bullet no matter whic h way.  
 
 
So we managed to es c ape and to walk
 
--
 
we were s topped
 
--
 
ther e wer en't too m any 
vehic les
 
--
 
by a truck  with Germ ans .  They s aw two women walking.  They as ked us  wher e we wer e 
going. We wer e going hom e from the m arket.  They offer ed us a
 
r ide.  Mother knew the village
s, as 
s he s aid, a c los e
-
by village.  She's going from ther e.  There are no r oads.  We're going to have to walk.  
We
 
got in the tr uck.  It kind of helped along we didn't have to walk  as  far. 
 
 
We got off and we took  off.  We walked until m other knew more or les s wher e the 
partis ans
 
were.  Some of the people m anaged to es c ape and m anaged to get wor d bac k .  Ac tually, a wo
man who 
was  a m idwife managed to es c ape.  She bec ame the head of the hos pital.  Ther e was  nobody else that 
knew how to stitc h up wounds .  We found out later.
  
We managed to es c ape.  We c ame to the edge of 
the forest and enc ountered partis ans .  It was  a small group.  It was  ac tually a r ec onnais s anc e gr oup.  

They agreed
 
--
 
m other  said s he's a ver y brave woman and s he has  a gun.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  They took  us  in.  Mother bec am e the c ook .  I bec am e the helper.  I k now how to peel 

potatoes, I'll t
ell you that.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  And fas t.  Really fas t.
 

9 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, Rae, it's alm os t s o diffic ult to imagine.  Here you are a little girl with your mom
 
no
w 
hiding with par tis ans in the fores t.  What was  that life like during the time you were with them? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  What was  life like? Well, a lot of it was  work.  A lot of it was  wor k.  Som e of it
 
--
 
ther e 
were other  kids.  They were under the protec
tion of the par tis ans bec aus e the Ger mans  wer e 
c onfis c ating c attle, hor s es  es pec ially and c attle.  They needed to feed their Army.  They c ouldn't 
pos s ibly provide as  fas t as  they were m oving.
 
 
If any of you have studied his tor y, you know that the Germ an Arm y was s o s ucc es sful they 
c ouldn't move fast enough into Rus s ia.  
 

 
So they c onfis c ated a lot of things fr om the farm ers .  So the far mers were happy the partisans  
were there bec aus e that was  s ome pr otection.  They grow their c attle further into the forest,
 
into 
c learing areas where the c attle c ould gr ays .  And they c ould c om e and m ilk  the c ows .  They c ould take 

c ar e of their daily needs .  And the partis ans  kept the Ger mans  away bec aus e they didn't want to 
engage into anything.  They wer e
 
interes ted in occ up
ying Rus s ia; t
hen they'll take c ar e of the back  s ide 
of it. 
 
 
However, the Russ ian fronts  kind of s topped.  It was  wintertim e.  The Germans  wer e not 
pr epar ed to go into the winter.  They were extremely c old.  The winters  were very c old.  We had winter 

fr om
 
about October until Eas ter
.  T
hat would give
 
you an idea of how c old it was , a
 
lot of s now.  
Vehic les  c ouldn't m ove.  There wer e no roads.  Forget about r oads.  The roads  wer e m ainly 
c obbles tone.  They were pr etty m uc h pitted from a lot of movem ent.  So moving was n't eas y.
 
 
Als o, the Rus s ian s oldiers  that had m anaged to es c ape
 
--
 
and m or e and m or e 
es c aped
 
--
 
organized them s elves  in the for es t.  Some of them went behind the lines .  The lines  wer en't 
that dis tinc t.  Som e of them went behind the lines to tell
 
what was  happening
 a
nd tr ying to get help.
 
The Rus s ian m ilitar y s ent s ome offic ers  to help to organize the partis ans  into a fighting gr oup.  
 
 
For  a while everything went along ok .  I'm  going to make it s horter.  I r ealize we're almos t at 
the tim e and we have a long s tor y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you have a ver y pivotal par t to tell us  about getting c aptured. 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  So the partis ans  were pretty muc h organized.  The main thing that they were tr ying 

to do
 
--
 
not trying to kill Germans bec aus e they didn't want to start a fight.  What they were doing was  
tr ying to s abotage the movem ent to the frontlines
, b
as ic ally the tr ain.  If you know about trains, if you 
loos en the ties  under the r ails , you know what happens  to a train?  It derails .  And when the t
r ain 
der ails , they would los e s om e of the amm unition and s ome of the guns.  Whatever they c ould c arry 
away.  And, of c ours e, the Germ ans  tried to r ight the trains
.  I
t took time.  That way they s abotaged the 
pr ogr es s to the fr ont.
  
The fr ontlines  started to move bac k .  They had a fr ont in the fr ont and a fr ont in 
the back .  
 
 
The Germ ans  bas ic ally
 
--
 
they wer e not s urr ounded but they had to fight their  way out.
 
 
Unfortunately for m e, I got s ick  with Typhus .  So we got disjoined fr om  our  group bec aus e I 
was  
taken
 
--
 
ther e was  a field hos pital set up further  into the for est.  This  wom an
 
--
 
the r eas on I told you 
about this  woman that was  a m idwife, s he was  in the forest in this hos pital.  My mother took  me in to 
her  to help heal m e.  Fortunate for me s he took g
ood c ar e of m e.  However, we got dis joined from our 
group.  And as  the Germans  did a blockade on the partis ans , we wer e with no one.
 
 
In or der to find the partis ans , they s tarted to move the population
 i
nto one of the towns s o that 
they do s earc h
es
 
wher e t
he par tis ans were and dis pos e of them .  They had to fight two fronts. 
 
Unfortunately we wer e brought to our hom etown.  We were in a dis tant village.  The villagers  did not 

know my mother  but in the town s he was  afr aid to s how her fac e.  And I had to bas ic ally go s cr ounge 
for food.
 
 
My head was  s haved.  I was  dres s ed like a boy.  They s tar ted to s eparate the m en fr om  the 
women of the villager s .  They br ought m e up and argued whether I'm a girl or a boy.  From  Yiddis h I 

knew quite a bit of German
. 
 
I'm pretty
 
good with languages.  So being afraid of being separ ated from  
m y mother I said one word that got us  into trouble.  I'm a girl.  If I k now the wor d, then I must be J ewis h 

and m y mother  was  hiding a J ewis h c hild.  
 

10
 
 
 
My m other, of c our s e, r an out.  She started to argue with them.  No
, 
I'm her  c hild
 a
nd I'm not 
J ewis h.  She's  not J ewish.  And my mother s poke m ostly Polis h amongs t the population bec aus e they 
either  s pok e Rus s ian or Belarus  and ver y few of them knew of c ultured Polis h.  So they c alled us  the 
bourgeois , 
higher  c las s.  And even though s he s aid s he'd m uc h r ather be hate as a
 
bourgeois  
than as  a 
J ew.
 
 
So s he c ame out and s he told the s oldiers  that I'm  her  daughter.  She started to argue with 
them.  She s aid they put us  under hanging tr ee.  It was  a b
ar with nooses .  I'll never forget that.  If she's  
your  c hild
 Œ ﬁ
if you agr ee that s he is  J ewis h, I'll just hang her; however , you're going to be left alive.
ﬂ
  
She s ays , "This is  m y c hild.  I'd s ooner you hang me fir st.  I will not s ee my c hild die."  
 
 
Th
ey dec ided that my mother was  telling the truth and they let us go.  However  it bec ame very 
uns afe of wher e we wer e.  So as s om e of the villagers  wer e let go, we ventured with them .  Again, 
m other  c hos e dis tant villages.  However , in that village s he was  t
r ying to find where the partis ans  were 
s o that we c ould r ejoin a group and be s afe.  
 
 
Eventually she m anaged
 
--
 
I'm not going to go through how and what. We m anaged to join a 
par tisan gr oup and we wer e liberated in the s ummer of 1944. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I
 
think, Rae, it's  obvious  to everybody in this  r oom that your  m other was  this 
r em arkable, c ourageous, r es our c eful, smart lady.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Unbelievably, unbelievably resourc eful.  She had a very foc us ed
 
--
 
s he was  ver y 
foc us ed on what she wanted to d

> > Bill Bens on:  In the little tim e we have left, tell us  about your liber ation and what, again, your mother 

did imm ediately in the afterm ath of it.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  After liber ation we went back to Glebokie, the larger town, to be, you know, s afer.  

There was  a gr oup of J ews  that s urvived, gathered there. We all lived in one hous e.  However , s he 

had s ome valuables  hidden in our hous e.  She actually had our hous e torched.  When the partis ans

her  way.  
 
 
She c ame back  to wher e we were in Glebokie and s aid we've got to get out.  Sinc e s he was  a

s upplies  with her .  We had plenty of potatoes . We got as  far with the train to Prus s ia.  Conditions  in 
Pr ussia were horr ible.  The Prus s ians mined everything.  They m ined even them s elves .  The m ilitar y

you went one s tep off the path, you blew up. 
 
 
Mother peeled potatoes .  She was  going to throw out the peels.  We had plenty of potatoes  at 
that tim e.  Ther e was  a m ilitary, a Rus s ian military,

not only has  Rae had to s kip over an awful lot of what s he went through, there is  a 
gr eat m ore to be told 
about what happened in the immediate aftermath of the war, their attempts to get to Isr ael, ending up in 

a 
dis plac ed per s ons  c amp
 
in s outhern Italy, and eventually making it to the United States and 
beginning a new life.
 
 
I'm going to
 
turn the pr ogram back  over  to Rae

>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e's  a lot in the first part als o worth looking at that you did not hear today.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our Fir st Per son gets the las t wor d.  So I'm going to tur n to

at that point to s tand s o that we c an get this  photo with you in the back ground.
  
Bec aus e we didn't have

Thanks for  being her e.  We have three m or e program s this year .  We'll r es ume again in Marc h 
2016.
 
 
On that note, Rae? 
 
> > Rae Goldfa
r b:  I jus t want to tell
 
you
, I'm doing this .  It's not easy
; h
owever , I feel that I need to 
honor my fam ily that has per is hed and the whole town that has  peris hed and a lot of other  people that 
have peris hed.  Unles s  we tell the s tory, ther e is  no way we c an prevent anything like this fr om 
happening again. 
 
 
It is  ver y diffic ult to unders tand what r eally we went through, es pec ially her e in the United 
States
. 
 
I'm a c itizen now.  I know. We're expos ed to a lot of wonderful things here.  Value your 
fr eedom.
  
Don't be intimidated by anybody.  Don't s uc c um b to any pr es s ures  from anybody, es pec ially 
you c hildr en.  Don't allow to be bullied into anything that you don't think is r ight to do.
  
And you adults , 
teac h your c hildr en to be tolerant.  That's  the m ost im
por tant thing.  
 
 
This  m us eum exis ts in order  to pr event any s uc h things  from happening again and it c an 
happen anyplac e.  It's  happening in a lot of plac es r ight now.  People that don't s us pect of what they 

ar e going to fac e.  A lot of refugees trying to esc ape.  I know how it felt to be a refugee
 w
ith no home, 
no family, no help.
 
 
Thank  you for c oming.
