Answer:  Mr . Max Her sch.  Pr evi
ous name:  Moses Hi rshkowitz  
 
Questi on:  When a nd whe re you were  bor n. 

 

A: I wa s bor n i n ?  Bukovina ( R oma ni a) on
 the 10th of the 4t
h mo nth, 1921.   
 

Q: Could you be s o ki nd to tell us
 a fe w wor ds a bout the bac kgr ound 
of your  fa mil y?   What was t h e  
occ upati on of your  pa rent s?  

 

A: I a m the third ge nerat i on bor n i n t his cit y.  M y
 mother was born in that
 city.  She married my 
father fr om a neighboring village
.  And my father was a busine
ssman.  He made
 fl our for the 
bakers.   

 

Q: Coul d you tell us  somet hing a b
out your  sc hool years , a bout y
our  country at mos phere in whic h  
you gre w up? 

 

A: As I wa s  young, we didn't feel
 t oo muc h a b out anyt
hi ng.  The r e wa s a tr anquil life, a ni ce,  
beautiful life.  Nice comm
unity life, togetherness, 
fri endly.  I we nt to school wi th non-J ews , 
Romani ans and Ger mans, and I ha
d friends , Roma nia n fri e nds .  
But t h en t he at mosphere was 
changed and the Hitler period came on
 and everything start to change
, by law, and also between the 
populati on. 

 
Q: Could you el
aborate a little bit on this? 
 
A: I  re me mber I we nt t o s chool.  
First ,  public  sc hool, an
d then came the law an
d Je ws coul dn't study 
anymore.  My father to
l d me  " You c a nnot go around not  st u
dying some thi n g.  You have  to l earn a 
trade."  And at that  ti me, I went
 for an apprentice to 
le arn j e welr y a nd watchma king.  He pai d, I  
remember at that ti
me, 1,000 lei for the appren
ticeship.  After a little whil
e, no Jew could learn a 
trade eit her because he 
wa s Je w.  Why do I know 
t hat?  Because all the Je
w boys wante d to le ar n 
the trade, and we ha
d to hide them in our back
 room and I and my boss us
ed to teach them little by 
little the trade. 

 

Q: Coul d you tell  me , pl ease , wh
at happene d t o you 
and your fa mily once
 the  war  bega n, once  
Roma ni a a n d Ger ma n y s t arted to lea d  their  
oper ati ons against  
t he Soviet  Union?  
 

A: At that ti me, ther e used to be t he youth, use d t o be pa ra mil itar
y.  Je ws wer e  in the ar my, but as  
the laws changed, Jews could 
not be anymore in the army.  
And the paramilitary youth was 
dismissed.  They used to take th
em to certain odd jobs.  For instan
ce, this region is a very cold  
region.  Fa lls  a lot of snow.  Meter s of snow.  An
d I re me mber one e pisode , they woke us during the  
night, and t h ey t ook us t o  the  po
lice st ation.  And t hey gat her ed ab
out  15 J e wis h yo
ung boys.  They 
kept them until in the morning.  A
nd that night and the previous da
y it was snowing, the whole night  
and day.  They ke pt us in the mor n
ing, and the y ga ve us shovel s and 
we went out of the city to clear

out the highwa y.  But there wa sn't --  you c oul dn't
 clear.  Her e, you clea r wit h a shovel, and the  
storm brought back the snow
 in the same day.  And we were ther
e on that  roa d a bout 10, 12 days . 
You can't  i m agine how 
cold it was, that  
guard that  watc hed us, his ear  was  froze n. 
 
Q: Which was before the 
be ginning of the  war?  
 

A: Yes .  Not  muc h be for e.  
I figure i t was about a year 
and a half, ma ybe two years. 
 

Q: I understand.  So what happ
ened to you and your 
family once the militar
y operation started on 
the bor der  be twe en Roma nia and Sovi et Uni on?  

 

A: Duri ng that -- the cit y
 is located on a pass, and 
the soldiers  --  th
e fighter  was alr eady at the pass.  
Despite there was th
e  Ri bbe ntrop Pa ct, Ge r many pre pare d for  
war.  Thous ands of
 tr oops pas sed by 
the cit y da y and night ne xt to t he bor der.  Pre vious
 to that they improved 
t h e highways t o the pas s. 
The y ca me bull doz ers a nd pe ople , Ger ma n pe ople, 
and fi xe d the highways . 
 And we di dn't kno w  
what could happen, but we anticip
ated something drastic 
will happen.  During that period when the  
troops came, I reme mb
er they used to come, the 
Italian troops, all the nati
onality troops passing by. 
What ha ppe ned one ti me , a group of I t alian s oldie r s 
ca me and r e sted i n our c
ity and not far fr om our 
home .  We  wore at t he 
ti me  already the st ar, a yellow star . 
 And t hey used -- the y wer e young 
people, they came to the hou
se to the gate to lend certain things to
 help them out.  Like oil and other 
things, a nd we  tol d t he m "Look, we
 are Jews.  We  are not  
allowed to talk to you."  And they used to 
say " What i s  Jews? "   The  Roma nia n l angua ge is a latin
 la nguage.  It 's al mos t  
simi lar to Italian.  We  

coul dn't tal k  per fe ctly, but we c
oul d we could underst and eac h ot her .
  Aft er a whil e, t he soldi ers  
were ordered to go to the fr ont.  Be
fore they went to the fr ont, they 
left little letters we shall send to 
their pare nts '  home .  A lot we  kne w
 t h at in a fe w days we woul d als o
 be e va cuate d fr om that re gi on 
to t he camp. 
 
Q: So what happened to you an
d your fa mi ly once  i t  was  de ci
de d t hat you wi ll be  deporte d?  
 

A: We di dn't  know anythi
ng, but we kne w t here wa s 
a lot of soldiers, German
 soldiers, in the city, 
and t he y use d to t ake the  old pe ople ,  they took i nto s t reet s li ke ghett os .  The y c oul dn't go to the  

business; they couldn't walk on th
e st reets; they c oul dn't do a nyt hi
ng.  They were concentrated i n  
two stre ets.  The young people , 
be ca use t he Romania n popula tion 
was in t he ar my and the Jew s  
wer e not  ta ken, t he y were put  to c ertain types  
of wor k.  Like  " pomp i eri" or fir e  de part me nt , 
sanita tion, me dical  depart ment .  I  happene d t o be
 by a doct or in the me di
cal de part me nt.  Othe r  
people were  on the  sa nit ation and fir e de part me nt
.  And t her e was t he gr oup
, a nd we  had to sta y  
there a whol e day.  The y  divi ded our  group i n thr ee 
secti ons i n or der we s hould be abl e to sle ep. 
And be cause  of that, we 
got a per mi t ;  we could walk on t he st r
eet.  One da y wal king fr om home t o 
that s o-call e d ser vice , a  frie nd of mi ne fr om 
my class, a Roma
ni an who wor e a n iron cross  
appr oac he d me a nd sai d to me , " You know you're a Je
w.  You're not allowe d to walk on the streets."   
I said, "I 'm not wal king on t he str
eet, I'm going to my service."  
And he as ked me  " Wh o ga ve you 
per mis sion? "  I sai d, "I ha ve here
 a document that t h
ey gi
ve me the per mis si on." 
 He took me to the 
police stati o n.  In the pol ice stati on, t he police  -- 
he took me to the police ch
ief, and the police chief 
said, "You go home whe r e you have t o
 go.  I gave  hi m the per mis sion."
  And a fter four  wee ks, they 
took us out  t o t he ca mp.

Q: Can you descr ibe  thi s oper ation?  
 

A: Yes.   

 

Q: Wh o took you, how, by wh at . . . 

 

A: Bei ng at night in that servi ce,
 he wa s the cit y doct or.  His na
me was Kibbit sch.  He  was a l so a  
ma yor for the city.  He wa s also a c aptai n in th
e  ar my , in the  Roma nia n ar my.  And t he wa r broke 

out , it wasn't  any war bet wee n Russi
a n and Ger m any, he wa s take n to
 the ar my.  He was the fir st  
sacri fice whi ch came back.  It wa
s a fe w days j us t .  And we over
heard saying that something will 
happe n, but  we di dn't know what  
wil l  ha ppe n.  And t his was be
for e  Yo m Ki pp ur.   B e fore  Yo m 
Kippur, t he y  let the ol d people out
 from that ghetto.  An d everyone 
we nt to Shul t o Kol Ni dre i . 
And, beli eve  me , in that  
Shul was peopl e who never 
we nt t o  Shul in the i
r life.  This was Yo m 
Kippur, and Suc cot h.  Succot h is
 a holida y for t h e taberna cle s, a nd bet w e en Suc cot h on Si mkhat  
Tor ah a l so a hol ida y, t here wa s a reprie ve for the 
holidays for poor people 
to be able to make 
existence, because the holid
ays is eight days altogeth
er .  I n tha t  ti me, t here  wa sn't TVs or ve ry few 
radios or tel ephones.  The announce me nt ca me t o 
Dr ôme (ph), a Seargent (?) came to t he center o f  
square or s q uare street  or nei ghbor hood i n Drô m e.
  And people gathered 
and he ar them read the 
decre e that i n 24 hours , we had t o le ave .  And 
we cannot ta ke anyt hi ng, just wha t  we 're able t o  
carry.  What  do you carr y a fter t hre e  generati ons ?   
We had some live ani mal s.  We gave t hem to  
some neighbors, non-Jewi
sh nei ghbor s.  I remember my fat h
er, may he r est in
 peace, had some 
jewelry took to ma
iria (ph) . . .  
 

Q: Ma yor?  

 

A: . . . t o the  ma yor.  
The  house of t he  ma yor, an
d mother  pr epared for t he 
evac uati on.  She  ba ke d, 
slaughte r ed kos her chic kens fr om t he  bac kyar d, a nd 
c ooke d the chic ke ns a nd pac ked the m, just t h e  
meat.  The soup left  ther
e on t he stove, and whatever
 we  c oul d carr y, and a t th
at  ti me we 
were  ju st 
three chil dren because one si ster 
wa s marrie d and my par ent s.  And 
we went to the 
station, train 
station.  Once we arr ived at the tr
ain station, we s aw t hat ot he r people
 took a lot of luggage, burlap 
sacks with pillows a
nd blankets.  I had a 
brother which wa
s younger than I was, and he said to me  
"You know somet hing?   Let 's go home and try t o bri ng wha t ever 
we can carr y ag
ai n."  And we  
went home and in th
e yard, he had a little
 wagon, and we load
ed up what we could load on that little 
wa gon and l ocked the door. 
 As we l ocked the door, 
s oldi ers patrol led t he  streets .  The y addres sed 
us " L ock the  door , l ock i t  good" wi
th a grin on their fa
ces.  And we left for 
t he t rain station, and 
then we left  there the car
riage, the little wagon and came on the train.  Many 
cars, cattle cars, most 
of them.  I don't know how ma ny, 
but long.  And ever y fa mi ly ke pt
 toget her, a nd we we nt int o a  
cattle car.  It was about 53 people
, children, old people, with their 
luggage with the 
belongings what 
ever yone ha d.  The n the y locked from outsi de the 
door , and the train sta r t to move .  St art to move - -  

this was, I think it was in the af
ter noon.  And we t raveled like that
 a ni ght , a  day, a nd we  stopped i n  
Czernowitz, I know we  stopped in
 Czernowitz.  It was dark, and th
e
n t he train start ed agai n, an d 
nobody kne w wher e we are goi ng.  Peopl e asked for 
water, and the soldiers 
sold wat er for a wat ch, 
for mone y, for a c hai n.  And we c a me 
to a city called Attaki
 or Pot ek, and t he y tol d us we shal l 
jump the cars.  There wa s the em
bankment from the car to the grou
nd, wa s maybe six fe et.  An d in 
that time, in that period, there is
 a lot of raining in that re gi on, 
a nd the  gr ound wa
s so wet and so 
muddy.  But if you 
pushed t hen out a foot , t he 
shoe remained there.  Wh oe
ver had a lit t le money, it

was also little buggie
s, horse and buggies.  Fami
lies gathered together an
d put on the 
buggies their 
belongi ngs a nd pa id that peas ant wh
at ever he aske d.  For me mone y at that t i me , di d mea n not hing. 
I didn't know a nyt hing what mone y 
is.  And we  travele d fr om e mbar k
ment to the Dnestr.  This is 
Pata ki.  
 

Q: Yes , t his wa s a  cr ossi ng point?  

 

A: Thi s was  the cr os sing.  And in t hat ti me , I re
me mber t he s ec ond da y t her
e was  Si mk has Torah in 
Jewish tradition, it is a 
holiday, but it's also say 
prayer for t he dead.  An
d there was a man i n our  
cattle car who tried to make it as po
ssible, tolerable.  And he used 
to come in and try to sing, but 
who had the mind to si
ng?  Everyone was in hyster
ics in that car.  And in 
the car, a little baby infa nt 
died, but eve ryone was s o -- his t h
oughts a nd t hei r thoughts that no
body t o ok act uall y c are for e ach 
other .  But there wa s -- nobody kne w where we we
nt, where we go, ho
w long we wi ll be there .  And  
once we came t here, I r e member a 
friend of mi ne, they had a  lot of 
c hee se.  Che ese s, their busi ness 
wa s chee se a nd s moke d herring fi sh, and the e asie s t 
thing what they thought 
was to take cheese and 
honey, 25 barrels , kilogr a ms of hone
y, unl ess they came t her e they sa
w t hat it  is not  pos sibl e to 
carry t hat .  And t hey as ked whoeve
r  wa nts hone y or che e se , to co me 
t o ta ke it .  And peopl e ca me  t o  
take  as  muc h t hey c oul d.  We 
stayed ther e a few days, and t hen 
the bridges over the Dnestr wa s 

destroyed, but the Germans built a 
railroad bridge over the Dnestr. 
 The Russian railroad is a little 
bit wi der than the Ge rman -- the European railroads.
  Now, they had to make
 it smaller in order to  
fit the rails to Romanian 
railroa ds .  But we  were  - -
 ther e wa s a  pontoon li ke a bri dge , a nd t he y put  
on that  pont oon a bout 100 
pe opl e, a nd the y we r e pulle d ove r on 
the other side to the Dnestr.  And 
the ot her si de of the Dne s
tr was a big city; in Russian, it's ca
ll ed Mogile v Podol ski y.  And the r e on 
the - -  not  far  from that ri ver, 
there was a bi g house.  I imagine 
during the Russian time, there was 
something, a gathering, 
a big, big buil ding, and t here  the y  
du mpe d us .  Then the r e was  just  
unbeara ble , unbeara ble; people l ost c ontr ol of eve r yt
hi ng.  Wh ereve r  the y had t o do huma n thi ngs,  
they took -- t hey di d it i n fr ont  of
 each other.  Because we met  othe
r people t here from Bessarabia, it  
was about two months earlie
r .  And t hey were  hu
ngry.  St arving, not hun
gr y.  I  r e me mbe r  m y  
fat her , he s h oul d rest  in peac e, we nt out t o the te
mple.  There  wa s a t e mpl e  not  far , a n d he  sa w t he  
people i n t h at ba ckyar d of the te
mp le hungry, starving.  He we nt 
outs i de  and he bought a ce real .  
Let's see, I don't know, I don't s
ee it here, but it's called hirsich 
(ph), a little cereal 
and he cooked it 
on a n ope n fire and gave  that t o the people t o ea t .
  But dur ing tha t  ti me , our
 family was together. 
Thi s mea ns my mot her , brot her -- two br others, a nd 
all the fa mily lived in 
one room, a nd t hey us ed 
to c o me - -  t h e soldier s us ed t o c o me , brea k i n the 
doors, ta ke a ll the  pe ople and se nd the m furt her t o  
other  ca mps .  And i n t h
e meanwhi l e, t he wi nt er was ver y  seve
re wi nter.  Strong winter, cold. 
During that short peri od, four peop
le of our fa mil y die d.  An aunt
, a n uncl e and two c o usins of my  
aunt .  And I re me mber we ca ught 
 --  t hey were t he  luc ky ones.  
There were some young people t o  
take ca re, t o  bury t he m,  beca use whoever didn't  
have s o
me body to ta ke care was t hrown on a  
carriage and sent t o the cemeter y.  
And comi ng up on t he  ce met ery, 
my uncl e --  we t hought t hat a  
Ra bbi of ours who taught chi l dre n, young chil dre
n, kinder garten chil dre n, he di ed be for e, and 
ever yone knew that  he wa
s dead.  We came up on
 that c e meter y, l ooke d ar ound ca da vers , thousands  
of the m, t housa nds .  We  found th
at Ra bbi there, and we buried 
the unc l e, and we burie d that  
teacher, that Rabbi .

deci ded was  my br ot her and I, we  de cide d that we 
ha ve t o lea ve M ogil ev.  During that  peri od we  

wer e caught  by the sol di ers and br
ought a gai n to that buildi n g.  An
d we bribed the soldier, gave 
them a watch.  And during the nigh

till 12 o'clock here.  Then comes  
anot her  sol di er.  Duri ng t hat peri

 After what happ

second day I talked to my 
pare nts .  " We ha ve to 
leave."  And it happen
ed that  a Ger man tr uck and sol dier s went
 to that direction,
 Mogi lev.  Now,  
where -- we didn't know where this is, but they 
told us there is another camp, and it's little bit 
tolerable.  And we paid 
them, took my parents and their little belongi

the crossr oa d of that cit y .  It's calle d Jewe (? ).  It was a very bit t er stor m, s now, a nd they l et us out at  

the crossr oa d in Je we(? ).  As we st ood there , st
ra ngers , we sa w appr oac hing a lady, a nd s he see s my 
mother and t hey knew each ot her. 
 They were school children in th

Bet we en one board to t h e ot her boa

And nat urall y, the fir st ni ght we sai d it 's Sl at(? )

And wit h whate ver we had, we covered our sel v es
.  Cold, you had one blan

covered, and this is the way we slept.  After a wh

of it.  I was sick fr om th

 spri ng.  And t here wasn't a

I had a frie nd of mine , he was a la wyer 's son.  He

laws, he coul dn't st udy.  
But  he  ha d a  fri end, a doctor.  This  he
 tells me already, my mo ther after the

He sai d, " Mrs. Hirs hkowi t z, I ha ve  
a friend, a doctor.  He will 
visit you.  If he can help
 you, he will try to help
 you."  He came to us , 
and no me dication, no injections, 
no pil l s.  He  said, 
" D o you ha ve c o ffe e b

happened my mother sai
d, "Yes, I have a package 
of coffee beans and a little
 bit cocoa."  He said, 
"Let's try that and 
God will have to help.  Cook 
the coffee beans as strong
 you can make
 it, and tr y  
to give him to drink.  This will ma
ybe invigorate his heart."  When I 
go t up in the spring, I couldn't

 Jews from t hat Je we(? ) had t o be ga there d in a

A: The soldiers. 
 

Q: Wh at kind of soldiers? 

A: It wa s Ro ma nia n an d Ger ma ns .  M ostly R o ma n i
an because t he gendar mery
 there was Ro ma nian.  
There was a section t here, gendar me
r y, but t hey were Roma nia n.  Th
e y t ook my brot her  and I ne ver  
saw him again.  He was th
ere about two years.  They built a bri
dge 1,100 meters.  
I don't remember 
the na me , t h e Bar ovka ( p h), I don't 
re me mber t he na me of t he region, 
but it  was not fa r fr om Ode ssa  
so me w here .  I d on 't re me mb er.   But  wh en the  R u
ssians advanced and the 
Ger mans ret reated, t hey 
took the few little Romanian
 Jews, because a lot had di ed, ther
e to Jassy.  Jassy was a Romania n  
city, a bi g cit y, bea uti ful c ity.  
And he wa s with a fr iend, a neigh
bor hood c hil d whic h was  older tha n  
my br ot her.  And he 
said to my br othe r "Look, we 
are so near t o our ci ty, I lo

like to be home ."  And my brot her a n d that frie nd we nt
 to that city.  They di
dn't know that it did not  
exist  a Je wis h s oul  in t hat  city. 

 

Q: Which was the city? 

 

A: _________,  where he wa s born. 
 And my brot her went t o a  peas
ant whi ch lived a litt le bit abov e 
our home , a nd t he me n of t he pe asa n
ts were in the war.  And the wo man needed help; she hired my 
brot her .  Under what conditi on, I don't know.  Bu
t I know that the othe r fr
iend of his 
was  o n t h e  
other  si de of the  cit y on an orde
r pas s.  And it  was East er, and th
at lady, the peas
ant wo ma n, gave 
my brot her t wo s oc ks -- two pair of s ocks.  And my brot her s aid, " A nd, look, I have t wo pair . My  

friend doesn't have any. 
 Let me  go a nd give hi m one  pai r ." 
 And s he sai d, " D on
't go through t h e  
city.  There's a lot of Germans th
ere."  He said, "No, I will go 
through the woods and I will reac h 
there ."  And he went , but onc e he rea c hed his hom
e, his fri end's home , he 
wa s de nounc ed and -- and  
his frie nd sai d -- my brot her sai d, "L
ook, I was bor n her e.  I we nt to 
s chool .  I lived here .  My whole  
fa mi ly, grandpar ent s li ve d here .  
My pare nts live d  her e.  As k t he 
poli ce --  chief of
 the police and 
you will see, because, 
the chief of police, lived 
-- was a neighbor of ours
.  They took him to the 
station, and t he c hie f of t h
e polic e sai d to hi m "I  don't know hi
m.  I neve r met hi m.  I  don't kno w  
that boy."  And they t ook hi m bac k to that pe asa nt  
and all t hre e dug a gra v e, and they wer e all shot  

in the back and f
illed in the grave. 

 

Q: Incl udi ng the  peasa nt?  

 

A: Including the peasant.  The p
easant was a little bit(?)
, I heard, but I didn't 
know him before the  
war .  He wa s co mmu ni s t , the pea s
ant.  This is what I found out 
after w ards. In t he meanwhil e, we  
were in Jewe(?).  In 1944
, Passover, the German
 troops start to retr
eat, and they make
 a battle line in 
our c a mp.  And beca us e we
 kne w Ger ma n , the y us ed t o sa y this
 is the first time
 they talk to 
some body i n  Ger ma n .  And 
we use d t o as k the m why are you taki
ng strangers.  They said, " We try 
to hold off the Russians."  But in 
the morning, they retreated and th
e second and third evening, the y  
were prisoners, taken prisoners. 
 But in the meanwhile
, the battle was still ra
ging in Jassy and  
Roma ni a, and a group of Jews fr om
 camp, once i t
 was cl eared the re
gion, went in to their homes. 
Like  Siret , Rogoznic a, 
_________.  Well , b
ecause we were under Russi an
 occ upat ion alr eady, the  
Russia n didn't gi ve us per mis sion, and we went 
from Jewe(?) to Bessarabia.  There we were  
appr oxi ma te  a fe w wee k s be fore  Pur i m ca me  up.  
There was a law at t hat
 time, which Churchill 
made it, t hat every forei gner i n the Russian terri to
ry has to be left to 
go home .  And we were

include d.  And t he y ga ve  us a  trai n, a nd we  were
 two kil o met er from Belc y(? ) , and fr om Bel cy(? ) ,  
we  ca me  t o war ds  Ja ssy.  Let  me  . . . 
 

Q: Let 's  go back, wit h your per mis si
on, for one second, 
back t o Jewe.  
 

A: Je we?  

 

Q: Yea h, Je we .  I would like you to t ell us how was 
your daily life there.  Wh
at was your routine?  

What  was  ha ppe ning 
every day to you? 
 

A: The routine was that if I w
ill describe you misery, there wa s no such a th
ing.  You cannot  
descr i be .  Pe ople were st arving for 
hunger.  People -- we didn't se e m
eat for four a nd a hal f year s .  
We didn't se e brea d for four a nd a ha
l f years.  We ate pea fl our  bake
d.  We use d to eat fr oze n sugar  
beets , a nd t his wa s a l uxury.  
Because ther e was a region of su
gar, and t he Ge r ma ns use d t o  
trans port  the  sugar beet s in
land.  And the beets that fell off th
e wagons or  the  truc ks , t his wa s our  
nourishment.  A part of ou
r nourishment.  But mo st 
of the m, I'm ashame d to 
sa y, the infe stati on of  
lice wa s so horribl e, I had it -- everyone had it.  If he was a la wyer or a doct o r or what eve r .  Peopl e  

wer e  star ving, dyi ng.  I r e me mbe r  
chi ldren two, three years old, 
chil dre n were inde pendent, grow n 
up.  They grew up by 
themselves, no superv
ision, nothing.  In spite of that, there was a little 
shi mmer  of hope t hat maybe -- t he 
hope  was in t he past .  How bea u
tiful it was in the home , how 
nice it was t he fam
ily, how ni ce it was in the city
, how nice  wa s --  thi s wa s.
  If we talked about it, 
this was a ce rtain thi ng of  hope .  But peopl e die d.  
I had a frie nd, a la wyer, and I re me mber I talke d  

to him.  He used to live on the h
ill above the cemetery, he used to lo
ok over some of the cemetery. 
And I said t o hi m " D oct or, what ar
e you looki ng? "  And he
 s aid, "I 'm l ooking th
at this will re main 
my  h o me ."  An d I wa s a  yo
ung ma n, and he was at that ti me, 
he had alrea dy t hree chil dren.  The  
children were my age.  He said -- 
I sai d to hi m " What are you t alking about ? "   He said, "Thi s is my  
last sto p."  An d a fe w wee ks lat e
r, he pa sse d a wa y.  This wa s -- 
the misery was so great that you 
cannot desc r i be it.  You cannot desc
ribe it.  I don't -- I didn't tell my
 c hildr en for yea r s.  The y gr e w  
up and they didn't know wh
at l ays  in my heart .  
 

Q: Can you describe any encounte
rs that you had in Je
we with local author
ities, with gendarmery, 
the army, with soldiers? 

 

A: We were -- yes, 
we were -- I have a good 
exper ience.  I was a jeweler.
  And nat urall y when you 
learn j ewelr y, you try t o  buy some  t ools .  I didn'
t take a nyt hi ng worthwhi
le from my home , but I 
took the tools.  Little t
ools, hand tools.  An
d my parents sold almost ever
ything fr om them, but the y  
didn't t ouch the t ools .  And my 
-- I had my clot hi ng a nd the y di
dn't t ouch my cl othi ng duri ng t he  
period I wa s  sick.  And wh
en I  got well , we had to do s o me -- we
 di dn't have anyt
hing.  We  had to 
do something to survive, an
d I tried to fix so mething.
  A watch, to make a so
ldering; very primitive,  
but I did it.  And wit h that, no
t for mone y, but  for  exc hange a nd 
food.  I r e me mbe r  I ma de onc e a  
pair of earrings fr om brass, and 
we exchanged it for a little
 pea fl our in order to
 survive.  There was 
a captain that -- a Ger ma n captai
n.  He was what do you call  i
t ?   
A messenger from Ni merov(?) to 
Bucharest .  And aft er the Ger man
s retreated, they killed the Jewi
sh population in 
Russia, and h e  
save d a fe w Je ws.  I re me mber a J e wish fa mil y a
nd a girl .  And br ought t he m, t hat pe ople i n our  
ca mp, and he support ed t he m.  Ever y mont h he us ed 
to go to Bucha r est .  Comi ng bac k, he brought 
provisions fo r them.  And after a wh
ile, he didn't come anymore.  
Then we  found out that the y s end

hi m t o Berli n.  This  is one inc i de nt.  The  ot her  in
cide nt, I re me mber  a gendar me  found out  that I  a m  
a jeweler .  They came to me and asked me i f I can
 ma ke hi m a  cross .  I ma
de hi m a cr oss_, and for  
that he gave me a half 
a loaf of bread and a little 
bit salt.  And the 
other incident I 
remember, a truck 
wit h Ger ma n s oldie rs s t opp ed  in fro nt wh ere we  
we re living, and you can'
t imagine the panic what  
was.  And t hey came in and a young sol dier sai
d, " Some body tol d me you'r
e a jeweler.  You can 
solder."  I sa id, " Yes ."  And he t ake s out a pair of
 glas ses .  The y ha d metal gla sses , met al fra me s . 
The y were broke n.  He sa id, "Pleas e, fix me the gla
sses ."  And I fixe d the m a nd he gave me a loa f of 
brea d.  This wa s the e xpe rience  what  I ha d, t he go
od experience.  Fr om the 
bad experie n ce, we  are  
not  talking.  It
 is too much. 
 
Q: I underst and it 's t oo much, but i f
 you - - it 's not too painful for y
ou to t e ll us a fe w, we woul d be  
very gr ate f ul .  I f it 's  too diffi cult , we  
c a n ski p t he m .  Whatev
er you will  de ci de. 
 

A: There was an inci
dent  when we were ferr ied over t he Dn
estr.  A family -- no
body knew really 
what happened and what w
ill  happen, a nd a fa the r  was ver y prot
ective of the chil
dren.  A soldier  
butt them w ith the butt fr
om the gun and that -- 
and killed them.  
This is incident
 which is not 
pleasant to tell. 

 

Q: I underst and.  So we can go 
bac k Belc y.  We l e ft , we i nter r
upte d your storie s a  mome nt whe n  
you were i n Belcy on 
your way back to ?-------. 
 

A: In Belc y, I met a fri e nd from 
my home town, and this was in 
Russia n  control.  And he was a  
wat chma ker , so nat urall y when you meet a per son 
who r e tur ns fr om dea d, i t  
wa s a  ju bila nt.  He wa s  
really ha ppy, and he s aid, "Look, 
ca n I help you? "  I said, " What can 
you hel p  me? "  At that ti me, he  
worked in a kolkhoz as wa
tchmaker.  He had -- they
 gave him a 
little store in the ce
nter of Belcy.  
And he wor ked ther e for  that , prob
ably he got bra ss whi ch wa s reall y
 scar ce in that
 ti me .  And he  
gave the m the profit what  he had a
nd he took a cer tain perce nta ge.  He
 sai d, "If you wa
nt to come to 
my store, come to my st
ore.  And maybe you 
will ma ke us a little living." 
 At that time, you didn 't 
measure money a living.  
A living was a piece of br
ead, a little milk, 
a piece of cheese.  That was  
the li ving.  I  remember t h ere came 
Russian s oldi er s and t he y s a id, "Y
ou have good grades.  Come  to 
us t o Rus sia and you will  see yo
u will  be very ha ppy.
  Where a r e you goi ng 
now? "  I s a y, " We ar e 
going home."  We  trie
d to go home, and there is
 still battles.  And 
they said, 
"Come, come to us . 
You will see how ha
ppy you will be."  This wa
s incident.  And then ca
me the order we should 
leave, and we l e ft.  We came ho
me.  We ca me through J a ssy.  In
 Jassy we were - - there was a 
colle ge, use d  to be .  I don't know 
if it is now, but it was bombed 
out dur ing the war , but there t hey  
put us up(? ) fr om the Joi nt Distri buti on.  And we  
wer e ther
e about a littl e whi l e, I don't re me mber  
exactl y the ti me.  In t hat city, I 
knew there was a friend of mi ne, al
s o, a wat chma ker wit h his fa mily 
there .  He had a br other there , and beca use 
t he brot her wa s mar r ied, he ca me -- afte r the  
appr enti ces hip, he  ca me  to his brot he r.  And hi s 
brot her ga ve  hi m exi sten
ce.  But, as you know, 
what happened in Jassy, 
the Progrom and the brothe
r was killed there in that
 period.  And after th e 
war , he ha d a busi nes s i n t he cent er of J ass y, a n
d I  found out wher e it  is  
and I  came  ther e.  And 
natur ally, he  invite d me home for 
lunch.  There ,  it's di nner .  Lunc
h is t h e biggest meal ther e in 
Europe, and he said, "Look, 
we have a little tools.
  Come to my stor
e, and whatever I 
will be able to 
give you to work, you'll ha
v e  so me wo rk ."  An d  it was so -- we were th er e a very sh or t ti me .  An d 

then we went home  by 
train to ________.  Ca me  to ______
___, we didn't  know yet my br othe r wa s 
dead.  We had still hope th
at he's still alive some where.  It 
was two weeks before

home .  And the first ne ws wa s th
at he wa s de ad.  And pre vi o us 
-- a fe w mont hs pr evious , ca me a  
s mall group of young J e wis h pe opl

of my brot her 's  frie nd, who were  kill ed  
toget her .  They dug t he m out from whe r e the y  we

ce meter y.  And nat urall y, whe n t hey

, the y put  a stone t here .  And I  
know I hope  to go visit hi m, to vi
sit t he gr ave of my br other .  An
d meanwhile, fr iends fr om Israel 
went to visit the cemetery
, and they told me that 
t h e grave was dese crate d, t he st one .  Di d I wa nt t o  
fi x it?   And I nat urall y I  said ye s, and I s end t he 
mone y, a nd they fix --  th
ey send me pictur es how  
the stone looks.  After they fi x it, they send me  a 
pictur e how they fixed the 
st one .  But  it 's  re peat ed  
agai n, a nd t hey found out that that brot her ha s re
latives, a brot her in Amer
ica.  And if they will 
break the stone, some
body will fix it.  And they
 made a -- want to make
 a business. And people 
gave me  advice I shouldn't 
fi x it  a nymore t his  ti me . 

 

Q: How l ong di d you st

A: After the war?  

 

Q: Ya. 

 

A: I ca me back -- 
Purim is approxi
mate early in spring, 
and the war was still ra
ging in Berlin.  And 
in May -- I think on the 5th of Ma
y was cease fire, and I 
stayed there till '47.  
During that period, I 
tried -- our home was destroyed from the -- our home
 wa s des t roye d from t he pr ojectil e s fr om the  
battles.  We  had a home, fi ve r
ooms, a veranda.  Ever
ything was ripped ou
t, doors, windows,  
ever ythi ng wa s shat tere d.  But onc e  we ca me ba
c k, my fa ther and I fi
xed t w o rooms , and the  
vara nda whe r e an ot her  be abl e to sl eep.  We di
dn't ha ve a n y fur nitur e, 
not hing.  A neighbor of  
ours ,  non-J e w, gave us s o me fur nitur e, a be d, a nd 
other t hings .  And we fi xe d up a s muc h we c oul d,  
and I tried to work my trade in order to survive. 
 Wa lking in the city, I me

pol ic e station.  He was very happy to see me .  "Do you

you did to me? "   "Yes."  He got ver y red in the 
fa ce, and I let it go.  And I  went home and sai d to  
my father "Father, this is not a 
fut ure for us, for young people.  
I like to go away 
from here."  And 
he said t o me "You are young.  
You can go, but I a m an ol d ma n.  And I  didn't slee p on a be d f o r  
al most  four and a hal f y
ears, and I  have now a bed 
I l i ke  to s l eep on."  A
nd a fe w frie nds  of mi ne  
and a c ousin ma ke up our mi nd to l ea ve the city, t o
 leave the country.  And 
we we nt fro m th ere to  
Arad(?), to Brakho(?)Tel Kotche k (ph) and meanwh

we nt to Vie nna .  He wa s a mechani c , de ntist me ch

him that he's in Vienna.  And  
once  I sai d goodbye t o my parent

never forget the train passed by in
 the center of the city and when 
we looked fro m 
our home a little

the train that particular place, 
please wave goodbye to me.  I 
will stay there."  And I saw her  
standing ther

  An d fr o m t here we wen t

had a  guide , a Hunga rian ma n, 
a nd we  pai d hi m some  mone y, 
but it's not th

A: That goodne ss of t hat  pers on I 
wi ll never for g et.  He took us to
 the border, and took us t o his  
town.  It was a little village, a
nd when we came from no man's la

He knew so good the destination th
at coming to pick us
 up, he left little si

picked the m up.  There  he took 
us t o his home , di vide  us i n t w

do you divide us?"  And he
 said, "If somebody will 
be caught, at least the ot
her group will be able to 
be s aved."  He  ke pt us  during t he night.  He ga ve
 us food, and he s aid, " Y
ou ca nnot go out from the  
house .  Ever ythi ng you have to do

Keep all together.  Stay

will take care of the rest.  If 
somebody will approa

 I will hold the tic

took us, he wa s fa ntastic,

to a point, where it is I don't know. 
 From ther e we ha d to t a ke a bus,
