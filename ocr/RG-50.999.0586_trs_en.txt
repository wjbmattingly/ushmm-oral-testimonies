Susan Hilsenrath was born May
 
27, 1928, in 
Bad Kreuznach
, Germany, theeldest of 
three children.In this photograph, Susan sitson a setof  steps with her brother, Joseph.
 
 
On Novem ber
 
9and 10, 1938, Kristallnachtor Night of Broken Glass, Nazi thugs 
sm ashedthe windows andfurnishings of theHilsenrath home. Months laterSusi and Joseph 

were sm uggled into France.
 
 
In May
 
1940, the German Arm y invaded France. Susiand Joseph were evacuated 
f rom a children's home in Versailles where they were temporarily housed. Soon German 
 

2 
 
soldiers arrived andthe childrenf led with their guardians to the unoccupied country under the 
Vichy go vernm ent. It indicates where they wer e.
 
 
W ith thehelp of the Hebrew Im m igrant Aid Society, HIAS, Susiand Joseph received 
perm ission toenter into the United States. Inform ationon this tag that Susi wore identif iesher 

name and states that she's sailingf or the United States on the SS Serpa Pinto.
 
Af te r cro ssin g 
the Pyrenees to Spain, the two children sailed to Lisbon, Portugal, and arrived in New York  in 

September
 
19 41
. Andthat'sSusi right there.
 
 
Please welcome Susi. 
 
 
And is that Joseph? Yes? And that's Joseph. Excuse me. 
 
 
Please welcome Susi to the stage.
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Hello, everybody. Can you hearm eall right? 
 
 
Good. Good.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: 
 
T hank you, Susi,for you being here today. I think your story is ver y 
interesting because it is ver y unusual. You were separatedf rom  your parents.W e're going to 

talk about that. But I wonder if you would talkabout what your prewar lif e in Germ any was l
ik e .
 
>> SusanW arsinger: You saw the picture atthebeginning.T hat was m y m om anddad and 

m y two brothers. And life was ver y good in 1933 when Hitlerf irst cam e intopower. My f ather 

hada nice store and he made a good living for us. And we lived ina ni
ce house. But then all of  
a sudden things changed.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat kind of  store did he have?
 

>> SusanW arsinger: A linen store. It was agood linen store. Andhem ade a good living for 

us but all of a suddenwhen Hitler cam e intopower, thepeople collaborated with the Nazis and 

they boycotted lots ofpeople's businesses. And so they boycottedm y father's store.Andaf ter 

a while he didn'thave any custom ers so he lost making a living and he had to close the store. 

So that's really the very first thing that I remem berthat happened.
 
 
T he next thing that I rem ember, I was going to go topublic schooland I was really 
excited to go to public school.And I was going to go tof irst grade. Iwas so happy to be going 

tof irst gradebut as soon as I started
 
school,things started to change because the kids were 
m akingf un ofm e.I couldn'tf igure it out. I was a little kid. Ididn't know aboutanti
-
S em it ism ,  I 
didn't know about hatred and injustice.
 
Theteacher was reading a 
book 
tous called " Der 
G if tp ilz, "
 
which m eansa poisoned mushroom. It was a picture storybook. She was teaching the 
kids inf irst gradethat Jewish children were poisonedm ushroom s.
 
 
So every day I toldm y m other Ididn't want togo to school but she said you have to go 
to school. Butone
 
dayI was really e xtrem ely happy. You know what happened?T here was a 
law in Germ any and itsaid that Jewish children aren'tallowed to go to public school.And I tell 

you, I was really happy about that. So I didn'thave to go to school anym ore.
 
>> S u z y S
nyder:  Did you go to Jewish school af terthat?
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It wasn't really a Jewish  school. All of the people in our town, all the 

Jewish people, they wanted their kids to have an education so they hired one Jewish teacher. 

Didn't teachus anything about religious or Judaism but this Jewish teacher had to teachall of  

the kids, all of the Jewish kids. So thef irst grade was in thef irst row, second grade in the 

second row, third grade in the third row, all the way to the 10th grade. And this teac
her taught 
us everything, geom etry, geology, how to wr ite and how to read. And he had really a big job, 

butall the Jewish kids were happy becausenobody called them adirty Je w anym ore.
 

3 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Backing up a little, did you have non
-
Jewish f riends
 
at this time orbefore this 
tim e and did they stick with you?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah, Idon't rem em ber that. I don't remember thatat all. But I do want 
to tell youone story abouta non
-
Jewish girl. I  don't remem berher being m y f riend. Can I just 
te l
l you that story? 
 
 
My m other used to send me to the grocery store and she used to say tom etobuy a 
loaf  of breador get som em ilk. AndhereI was this little kid. I was really very proud to be going 

to the grocery store.
 
 
So this is where we lived, like
 
here. And at the very end of theauditorium  is where the 
grocery store is. And where allof  our audience is today is a park. So in orderto getto the 

grocery store, I couldn't walk through the park and get to the other side of the grocery store. 
 

 
So on oneday I hadmy pf ennige inm y hands, Swiss and Germ anm oney, and I 
walked down the stairs into thepark andthe gatekeeper started scream ing at me. He said, 

" Hey, you girl, you can't go throughthe parkanym ore." And I was this little kid. I couldn'tf ig
ure 
out why I couldn't go through the park.
 
SoI ran hom e. I was really scared andI ran hom e and 
toldm y m other. And she toldm enotto walk through thepark anym ore. Of course, she didn't 

tell m e what was going on in Germ any atthattim ebecause she wanted to sparem e.And she 

probably f igured that this whole thing was goi ng to blow over, all of  this hatred and 

anti
-
S em it is m.
 
 
So the next tim e she sent m etothe store, I got to the steps andI had to say if I 
wanted to go tothe grocery store over there, I would have to goall the way down the street, all 

the way up, and all the wa y around. So the audience can probably guess already what I 

decided to do. I stood there andI said tom yself, I'm  really ver y tired
. S
oI started to walk 
through the park. And t
he gatekeeper cam eout. Andthen he hadadaughter. And in trying to 
answer your question, she was just aboutm y age, maybe adropolder. Maybe she had gone 

to school with m e. I just don't rem em ber exactly. She saw herf ather throwing rocks at m e 

because h
e was really angry because he had told me not to go through the park anym ore. So 
he calledm eall kinds of horrible nam es. And he started tothrow rocks at me. And she saw, 

this girl who had been m y friendm aybe but I'm  not sure
,  
th is  lit t le  girl wa s  le a rn
i n g f ro m h er 
father abouthatred and about anti
-
Sem itism .He was her rolem odel and I guess shef igured if  
he's doing it, she would do it, too.SoI remem berthis part, that girl.
 
Buthonestly, I don't 
rem em ber those little kids anym ore.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  D
id  
you 
recount this to yourm other?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Oh, yeah. And Itell you, Inever waked through that park again.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andso your m other,at thispoint
 
--
 
your mother worked with your father.Is 
that correct?They ran the store togethe
r until they couldn't
 
--
 
they had to sell the store or did 
they stay at home?
 

>> SusanW arsinger: She stayed at hom e and took care of us.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  How did your parents react to the anti
-
Sem itism , tothe sudden closing of  
their business, 
t h e 
f a c t t
hat yourf ather losthis livelihood. Do you rem em ber? 
 
>> Susan W arsinger: So
 
Iheard them talking at hom eandm y m other always said let's get out 
of  Germ any. And theplace she wantedto goto was the UnitedStates because she had heard 

this was the greatest country in the world. And m yf ather,he wasn'tin sucha hurry but he 

thought maybe it was going to blow over. 
 

4 
 
 
And this was pretty m uch what was going on in Germ any atthe time.
 
You know, a lot 
of  Germ an Jews, theydidn't want to leave becausethey were Germanf irst and Jews second. 
T hey f igured, well, m aybe things are going to get better. But itdidn't. It really didn't get better.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Your father was originall y born in Poland. Is that correct?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Buthe assim ilated quiteeasily to Germ an society..
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes, he did.W e spoke only Germ an inour house. I never learned 

anything about
 
--
 
anything Polish. And I never did get tom eetm y gra ndparentsthat lived in 
Poland.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So
 
up until this point, the anti
-
Sem itism  is therethen. In November of 1938, 
Kristallnacht happened. Can you describe that evening f or m e?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah. My brother,theolder one,not the baby butthe older one, we 

slept inthe sam ebedroom together. It was around 11:00.W e were really ver y e xcited because 

thenext day was going to be November
 
10,my m other's birthday. So we were still up at 11:00. 
W e were talking. And just then some bricks and rocks were being thrown through ourbedroom 

wi n d o w.
 
My brother, who was a year younger than Iam
,  
and still is a year younger than I am , 
he pulledhim self  up. He had to pull him self  up tothe window sill. I r em ember like he did a 

pushup andhe lookedoutside to see what was happening and who was throwing the bricks 

and rocks through thewindow. Andhe toldme, "Susi
ﬂ 
--
 
that's how you pronounce it in 
G e r m an
. ﬁ
Susi, it is our neighbors
ﬂ 
thatare throwing the bricks
 
and rocks through the window. 
 
 
And there was a policem an on the side of thecrowd. He was standing like this. And he 
didn'tdoanything to stop the crowd.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andat thispoint your m om hadanother child, thebaby.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes, Ernest,the one that you saw. He was in his crib. W e were really 

scared when that happened so we ranacross thehall to our parents' bedroom . And the rock 

had justfallen on topof the baby
™s
, Ernest's,hand. But he was ok.So we were huddling there 
together trying to decide what todo.
 
 
Just thenthe crowd had uprooted a telephone pole and they sm ashed it through our 
f ront door.Their objective reall y was to get tothe rabbi's apartm ent. W e lived onf irstf loor.T he 

rabbi lived onthe secondfloor. Anda non
-
Jewish f am ily lived on the thirdf loor. Andthenon 
top was an attic.
 
 
Som y f ather said, well, let's go andhide in the atticuntil this whole thing blows over. 
But inthe meantime these people were going throughour apartm ent with this poleand they 

ransacked som eof our things. Idon't remem ber exactly what they took or what they brokebut 

th e
ir objective was to get to the rabbi's apartment.They destroyedmost of his artifacts,his 
books. And Idon't know what other things they destroyed.
 
So anyway, we got up to the attic. 
And the rabbi
™s
 
fam ily was already there.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W ithout the 
rabbi?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ithout the rabbi.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andwhat about yourf ather?
 

>> SusanW arsinger: Ok, letm e just tell
 
you, m y father
 
--
 
let me tell about the 
rabbi and tell 
you aboutm y f atherfor a second.Is thatok? 
 
 
W hen we  go t  u p t h e r
e, the rabbi wasn't there. AndI lookedout the window and the 
rabbi was standing onhis veranda. He hadaveranda because he was the rabbi ofthe town. 

So he had the veranda and he was standingon the veranda andtwo SSm en were holding him  

5 
 
like this and 
a third one cam e and cut off  his beard.
 
So he wasn't up in the attic andm y f ather 
wasn't up in theattic
. 
 
 
T he reasonhe wasn'tup in the atticbecause, later If oundout, thatthey arrested all 
the Jewish m en in our town andput them  in jail. Butm yf ather cam e back
 
--
 
the rabbi didn't 
com e back butm y f ather came back to the attic. At the tim eI was very happy but I wasn't quite 
sure why they let him  out of jail. And later on Ifound out I really should have talkedtom y 

father when I was anadult to get allof  thedetails. And I'm advising to you in theaudience,if  

you have parents or grandparents, ask them all thethings that youneed to know because, you 

know, af ter they passaway, it's too late.
 
 
But anywa y, the part that I know aboutm y f ather
 
--
 m
y brother and If igured this out. 
Eitherm y f ather got out of jailbecauseheused toplay chess with the mayor of  the town and 

m aybe the m ayor had som e kind of  feeling f or him
,  
I'm  not sure
, o
r because m y father was 
Polish andat thattim eHitler said he was going to take over all of Europe, and atthat tim e they 

hadn't takenover Poland yet. Andhe was Polish. Andm aybe because he was Polish they 

didn'tputhim in jail. But I'm  not sure of the reasonf or it.
 
 
So anyway, he came up tothe attic.
 
>> S u z y 
Snyder:  So historically, October
 
1938, which precipitated Kristallnacht,German Jews 
of  Polish origin were put out of Germ any. It'sam azing your f ather
 
--
 
thathe was not putout of  
Germ any andback into Poland. My guess is theformer and not thelatter, that there was a 

relationship
 
--
 
that them ayor took pity on him. Becausem y guess is that
 
--
 
I'm  su rm isin g tha t it 
wouldn't have happened otherwise. 
 

>> SusanW arsinger: Because I really wasn't ever sure. Yeah.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I think it's hardto know.
 
And we have this saying that we always tr y 
to
 
--
 
there's no rhym eor reason to what theNazis were thinking because it was never the 
sam e.T hey never did the sam e thing twice. 
 
 
So you were in the attic. Described whathappened inthe attic.
 
>> Susan W ars
inger:  I'm  not sure,m aybe three orfourdays or something like that. It was 
Novem ber.T he town, m y father, I guessall of the people in the building had put apples inthe 

attic because it was just right af ter theapplepicking season so there were piles 
of  apples on 

thef loor, so we ate them . W eplayed with therabbi's kids andm y brotherand I, we playedwith 

them .W em adeabacioutof them .W e werechildren.And we didn't realize the consequences 

of  what was going to happen, you know, af ter that.
 
>> S u z
y Snyder:  Andyou think part of that is because your parents
 
--
 
your m otherand the 
rabbi's wif e did the best thing they could, which is really keep youf rom  understanding what 

was going on?
 

>> SusanW arsinger: Exactly. I rem ember this one thing
 
--
 
maybe
 
kids in theaudience want to 
know about this. My f ather had allof  his savings. And he didn'thaveit in the bank. He had it 

under
 
t h e 
mattress. So before we ran up to the attic, he took them oney outand hemademe 
wear it in m y underwear. I rem em ber we couldn't go to the bathroom . So when we were up 

there,the money got really wet.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  I'm  telling you thisfor areason, because themoney came in very handy 

later on.W e dried it allout.I'll tell you lateronwhat happened
 
to that m oney.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So at one point you decideit's saf eto go back downstairs.W hat condition 

did youf ind your apartm ent? 
 

6 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T his is thepartI don't rem ember. I know historicall y that the Jews
 
--
 
can 
you tell the audience
 
whathappened? Idon't know because I was little. Idon't remem ber.I 
don't remember.But we did gobackto theapartm entand they did the best that they couldfor 
us to live there
. B
utm y father andm other at that tim e, like all of theJews in Germ any, d
i dn' t  
want to stay in Germ any anym ore.T hat Kristallnacht broke everybody up. It was a get out, get 

out.That was what hesaid to everybody. So m y f atherand mother like most of the people tried 

to  ge t ou t.
 

>> Suzy Snyder:  Did you havef am ily li vin g in the United States?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes, I did. My f ather had a cousin who had a picklefactory in Brooklyn. 

He tried to get intouch with her. She dideverything she couldto get papers and affidavitsfor 

h im , fo r the  fa m ily
, b
utit wasn't enough.
 
>> S u
zy Snyder:  It was quite a diff icult process. She had to really be able to supportaf amily 
of  f ou r .  R i ght?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Five.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t, the baby. If orgotabout thebaby. So whatdid your parents do after 

Kristallnacht then? 
 

>> S u s a
nW arsinger: Som y f atherhad heard about this lady who li ved in Franceand shewas 
sm uggling children across the border into France. And she was pretending thatthese children 

were her children.And she had these passports for herown children. And somehow I guess 

they tookour picture and put it in the passport.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm e just rem indthe audience that atthis pointGerm any has not occupied 

France because it's still 1939.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T his was 1939. I'm tryi ng to rem em berthemonth. I think it was 

August
 
19 3 9.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You were sm uggled into Paris.W hat was that like, do you remem ber? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W e had a second cousin who hada nice littleapartm ent inthe Place de 

la Vendom e. He was a young m an, you know, a young guy. He hadthese two children in his 

little apartm ent. Sohe hadto go to work, so he told us to stay in theapartm ent.
 
 
My brother, he was the curious one. He was like 7
 
1/2, and he decide
d  
he wasn't 
going to stay in the apartm entall day and wait for him
 
to com ehome. Heused to goout of the 
apartm ent, sneak into the Metro in Paris, go all over
 
--
 
you know, go under the 
s t ile ,
 
go all over 
Paris, com ebackbefore the cousin
 
--
 
second, third cousin cam e back. 
 
 
So this wentonfor two weeks. T hisman could
n't keep us anym ore so he f ound 
organizations
 
--
 
I don'tknow if  at that tim e it was the HIAS or the OCE or the Quakers.All of  
those people, I'm thankful tothose threeorganizations because they helpedm y brotherand 

m ethroughour whole tim e while we were separatedf rom  our parents.
 
So they f ound a place 
for us to live on theoutskirts of Paris.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andhow long were you there? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, it was 1940. Andin May of 1940 we used to lookoutthe window 

and we used to see airplanesflying by. I think it was Germ an airplanes. They were dropping 

bombs
, n
otonParis but on the outskirts. And we could see them. I rem ember it looked like the 
Fourth of  July.
 
 
So oneday we were going to Paris. And Idon't know what mademy brother be 
in  
Paris. I just don't rem em ber. But we were there and I think it was May
 
1940, that's when the 
Germ an Arm y cam e into Paris.And we were there. Not only the Jews butm any, many people 

in Paris were f rightened. They wantedto runoutof  Paris. Soa lot of them  went to the south, to 

7 
 
Vichy. Anda lotof people went west. And there's this town,m aybe the people in theaudience 
know, it's about 40
 
m ilesf rom  Paris, it has the palace in it. Does anybody know what thename 
of  that town is? 
 
 
I heard it.Versailles. You're right.W hoever said it, you'reabsolutely right. T here's a 
big palace there. A lot of people went. So Idon't know, I think two nuns
 
--
 
we were these two 
children.W ehad nothing to do with thefam ily that was taking care of us.W e were justthese
 

two children marching. There were people going in cars.T here were people going on 

horseback, on bicycles, and walking, just to get out of Paris.
 
 
So we endedup in Versailles. A lot of peopleended up there. And the mayor of  the 
town, I guess he was really shocked. He didn't know what to do with all of  these people.
 
So  
guess what. You know, the biggest house inVersailles was thepalace, sothey had to putus 

up som eplace. 
 
 
I don't know how m any of you
 
--
 
have you been there?They have these beautif ul 
ga
rdens. Andthis palace, way on theother side there was thisbig pile of hay, as high as the 
ceiling, I think. Sothey gave us burlapbags and eachone of us took one of the burlap bags 

andf illed it up with straw and the hay, and then we tied itup with a
 
string and that was our 
m a tt re ss.  

 
So the biggest room  in thepalace,doesanybody know what the biggest room in the 
palace is? 
 
 
Righ t, th e  
H
a ll of  
M
irrors. And so inthe Hall of  Mirrors, maybe it's like twice as 
long
 
--
 
notm uch wider, twice as long as thisauditorium . Andthere were m irrors and 
chandeliers hanging down and on the side.So we putour littlem attresses next to eachother. 

So the whole Hall of Mirrors was f illed with m attresses and we were sleeping there.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hat m ust have been surreal.
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It was.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Meanwhile, what is going on with your f am ily back in Germ any? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, we kept on writin g to them .W edidn't really hear anythingf rom 

th em . I d i
dn't know what hadhappened.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you didn't know what was going on.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: No.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So af ter you are in Versailles, what happens then?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, can Itell about one incidentthat happened in Versa
ille s?
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Yes.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, you will think this is really interesting. Can I tell it to you? Ok. 
 
 
So you know the Nazis didn'tdecide to just stay in Paris. Guess where they went. 
T hey cam e toVersailles, you're right. And I rem em ber I could hear the boots. It was like a 

c
aravan of boots and tanks and cars. You could hear themf rom f araway. T hey stopped in 

f ront of the palace. And the mayor of  the town was thereand thishigh off icial at the beginning 

of  t he  c
aravan came out. I
 
don't know if  he was a general or a mayor, I don't know. Anyway, he 
cam e out. He was thistall
, c
am eoutand they wanted to talktoeach other.
 
T he mayor of  the 
town didn't know how to speak any French
 
--
 
I'm  sorry. Them ayor of  the town didn't know how 
t
o speakany Germ an.And the Nazi off icer didn't know any French.So som eone in the crowd 
said, oh, there'sa little girl in the palace, she knows how to speak German.
 
So guess who it 
wa s .
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 

8 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes. So I'm  10 years old by then.
 
10 years old. So I come out andthe 
off icer, really this tall. So they started talkingto eachother. And Idon't remem ber they talked 
about.
 
Anywa y, at theendof  the conversation, the Nazi off icer bends down to me and said, 
" Little girl, how come you know how to speakGerm an so well?"  So Isaid to him, "The schools 

in Franceare really good andI learnedhow to speak them ."
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Good answer. So atone point youm oved again.
 
>> 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Ok. So anywa y, I don't know
 
--
 
on the map, saw before, there was this 
wh i
te  
line in them iddle of  France, likeonthewestern coast it wentup like this. That part the 
Nazis ga ve to Franceand said that's going to be the unoccupied zone. So a lot of people 

wanted to go intothe unoccupied zone. And you saw Vichy, which was in thatpartof  the 

unoccupied zone.A lot of  people went down there.And there was achateau in a little town. It 

was a vil lage. So som ehow or other, I don't know how we got there but it was run 
b y the  OCE , 

oneof  theorganizations that was helping lostchildrenf rom all over
, t
hey put them  into this. 
And it was an old, oldcastle.
 
So inthis castle we ended up in theunoccupied zone.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Let's be clear, the unoccupied zone, or Vichy,
 
was really run by a 
collaborative government.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah. Andhe was collaborating with the Nazis. But it was better than 

living in the occupied zone.W hen I was a little kid, we didn't see any soldiers. So they leftus 

alone there.
 
 
B u t  in
 
the meantime, I didn't hear anything from  m y parents.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Still no word. And what was it like atthe chateau? 
 

>> SusanW arsinger:  I wrote a diary.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You did write a diary. T his is true.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: She's theone that
 
had it translatedform e.We had a little talk before. I 
never wanted to read it because it was so childish. She was going to ask me some questions 

about thediary and I said I don't remem ber the diary but askm e som ething aboutthe diary 

andthen I'll se
e  if  I  rem em be r  i t .
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W ell, describe
 
--
 
f irstof  all,you were, again, with Joseph the whole tim e.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andhow was he doing? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, he was curiousas ever. He was in the sam e chateau butall the 

boys were on one side and the girls were on the other side of the chateau.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Did 
you 
feel a sense of relief  having landed in thechateauand being there?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah, Ihad a sense of relief but I was m issing m y parents.And I was 

writing to them  all the tim e.W e really didn't know what had happened tothem.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andyou were writin g still to BadKreuznach, right?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder:  Did hearf rom  them at all?
 
>> Susan W ars
inger:  No.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat was your day
-
to
-
day l if e like? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T hat's very interesting because I don't rem ember all of the details. I 

know all the kidshad a job. AndI know all the kids
 
--
 
some people learnedhow to darn socks 
and 
some of the girls that I was f riends with darned socks.And we had to help inthedining 
room . 
 

9 
 
 
Oh, I remember this one story.
 
Once in a while we got strawberries andthe kids were 
allowed to serve the strawberries. So I rem em berI got this big bowl of  strawberries and Igave 
onetoeach of the kids. I hadputone down f or m yself becauseI didn't want to m iss.So then 

when I got to the last kid, there wasn't a strawberry. And I think I remem ber writing that in that 

diary. I tookm ine and I gave it to the
 
kid.I thought that was ver y generous ofm e to do that.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  At that time it was becausefood was at aprem ium.
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It was ver y special.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  In your diary you talk aboutbeing hungry, occasionally st
ealing grapes f rom  
the trees,trying to get grapesf rom the trees.T heseare things we take f or grantedbut clearl y 

were very vital to you.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Can I tell about onemore thing?I don't know if I wrote about it in the 

diary but letm e know.
 
 
Anyway, when it was som ebody's birthday, we used to
 
--
 
thef riends of  theperson, we 
usedto go to the caf eteria and we used toborrow a tray, you know, like you get in the cafeteria 

when you go to lunch.So we got this tray and somehow or other we got s
o me
 
do ilie s
 
or we 
m ade doilies out of paper. So we hid them  insom ebody's locker.W e had a locker.So what 

ever ybody did who wa s in on thisbirthday surprise, they didn't eat their dessertf or three 

weeks. And we saved it. And we put it on the tray. And thenonthe day or the day bef ore itwas 

the girl's or boy's birthday, we picked af lower f rom  the garden.It was m aybea daisy or 

s o m et h in g lik e
 
--
 
it wasn't even a daisy. W hatare those weeds called? I keep
 
--
 
da nd e
lio n
. 
Yes, thank you. So we put it onthe
 
tray and we decorated the tray. And inthe morning before 
theperson woke up, we took the tray with all the goodies and we brought it to the personand 

sang 
ﬁH
appy 
B
irthday
ﬂ 
to  the m.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  For m e, it really shows that there was adeterioration 
of  s i t ua t i o n a nd  yo u 

didn'thave much so you tried tom ake do with what you had.
 
W henwe were talking, I saidit 
seemed like you tried to make what was not norm al into normal. And you did the bestthat you 

could,m y guess is, at the ageof 12. 
 
 
In your diary, I'm  just going to read you one quote because you writ e about everything 
daily. You write about things that
 
arehappening. You go to Shabbatservices because 
apparently it's an Orthodox, religious chateau, or they introduce Orthodoxy into it.
 
 
You writ
e ,  ﬁH
o w long is  it since I ate a piece of chocolateor apieceof  cake? Ihave a 
terrible longing. Yes, papaof ten said when you aref araway, you will notice how good us 

parents are. I always laughedathim  saying i t would bem uch better and now I really 
notice 

what I said then. I'm  learning today how bad this is. How nice it was with my dear parents in 

Germ any. I believe that was the bestpart ofm y lif e.And I was so stupid not knowing how 

lucky we were.
ﬂ 
 
Andat this point you still haven't heardf rom  your parents.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: No. Yeah.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So at what point do you leave the chateau?W hathappened? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W e were therefor a year, almosta year.W ehad gone to school inthe 

town, in the Village. It was thef arm ers.T hey hada schoolfor all the kids in the village. T hey 

wanted us goto school with the village kids.
 
 
And,again, I don't know why the Villagers didn't want the Jewish kids to mix in with 
their kids because wecould have taught them  somany things. Because some of ushad com e 

f rom big cities.W e had been around and these kids hadonly been on thef arm . And we could 

10
 
 
have learned a lotf rom them
,  
so it would have been a goodm ixture.But they wouldn't allow us 
go to school with them  either.So we had a Frenchteacher who taught usall about geography 
and who taughtus about the United States.W elearned a lot of things f rom this particular 

teacher.
 
 
So anyway
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber if you were learning English?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: No. I was looking
 
f o r --
 
and was going to show it to you today. I 
had
 
--
 
we had all of our lessons written. I have to check to see if  it says 
Œ 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I was going to say, you haven't given this to us?
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  I can'tf ind it. I lookf or it. SoI thoughtm aybeIgave it to the museum .
 
 
Anyway, no.W ehad enough to learn everything in French.W e had to do math, 
reading, writing, ever ything in French. So we didn't know any English at all.
 
 
So anyway, let m e just tell you what happened one day. It was
 
in 1941 andthe 
d
irector, it was a lady, a directory
 
--
 
nobo
dy ever got to seeher. Only got to seeher whenyou 
were bad and I was alwa ys a ver y good person. I never didanything wrong. I alwa ys behaved 

m ys e l f .
 
 
So anyway, so what happened was she called
 
me to heroff ice and it was really ver y 
f rightening. I started towalk down like a m arble staircase. I came into heroff ice, which was  

lined in wood. She was sitting behind her desk. I was scared.So she said, " Susi, you're going 

to go to the United State
s." 

 
I didn't know what was happening. She said
, 
" Your parents are in the United States. 
And they had the HIAS and the Quakers andthe State Departmentand everybody in the 

United States that they couldthinkof  were looking f or you.
ﬂ 
So the Germ ans kept very good 
records and the French people kept very good recordsand they f ound us. And they sentus 

tickets to com e to the United States.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber the trip? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andhow you felt.
 
>> Susan W arsi
nger: Yeah. I was very excited. I was excited because I knew I was going to 
get to seem y parentsagain.W e had known som ething was going on in Germ any but, 

rem em ber, it was 1941. The concentration cam pshadn't really started killing all of  those 

Je wish  p
eople. But we knew som ething horrible was going on in Germ any. So we didn't know 
if m y parents had gone to a ghetto or a concentration cam p.W e didn't know. So when Ifound 

out that they were there, I was really ver y happy.
 
 
Can I tell you som ething about the trip? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Please. Yes.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: You saw in thebeginning, you explained the little tag, it was like a 

ta g
 
--
 
Eleanor Roosevelt, she wanted tohelp a lotof  the children get over here.And evidently, 
what I f ound out later, not
 
too long ago, thatthe children I came
 
--
 
she had50 children com e 
on this boat called the SerpaPinto. And they found room
 
--
 
the twoof  us, m y brother and I, to 
go with those 50 children on theboat to Serpa Pinto. Andthis was in Portugal. So we hadto
 

go south to Marseille, over the Pyrenees and across Spainand thePortugal and the capital of  

Portugal, Lisbon
, 
so we took the boatf rom Lisbon, and that was supposed to take us to the 
United States. It was a Portuguese ship.
 
 
So the trip, 
c a n 
I 
tell you about the trip? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Please.
 

11
 
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It was like 14 days. And thetrip was up anddown, up and down. It was 
a cruise ship but it wasn't anything like the cruise ships that they have now. It was much 

sm aller. So the50 children were assignedtothehull of the shipatthe very beginning, in the 

f ront of the ship. And we weren't supposed toget m ixed up with any of  the otherpassengers 

on the ship.
 
 
So anyway, m y brother wasn't going to listen to that.So he was all over. He was all 
over the ship. And hefound where they were stashing a whole closetf ull of freshpineapple. 

And we had never eaten any pineapple. Sohe kept on eating thesepineapples. And Itell you, 

he spent a lot of time on deck getting rid of the inside intothe Atlantic ocean.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  My guess is he doesn't eatpineappletoday.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: He doesn't. He won't. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andwhat was the mood on the ship?W as them ood good?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, them ood was good because they had told us in 14 days, at 

6:00
 
in them orning, the night bef ore they told us
,  
we would passby the Statue of  Liberty. At 
6:00, all the kids, the 50 kids, were very e xcit ed andall the other passengers were excited, too, 

so we were all on
 
--
 
atthe railing of the ship. It was like 10m inutes to 6:00
 
and there was a 
fo g. It wa s so  th ick. Y
ou did like this to your hand
; y
ou couldn't see.We were really all upset. 
 
 
But we stayed up there. And I'm  not telling any lies
;  
this is really what happened.T his 
is oneof  thethings inm y lif e
 
that I'm never going to forget, thism ore so than having m y 
children andhaving my grandchildren.
 
T hatfog at 6:00
 
lif ted likethis, like a curtain, like this. 
And then the Statue of Liberty just cam e into view and we saw the whole thing. It was really a 

ver y exc iting thing because it meant to us,f irst of all, that we were going to see our parents 

andthat we were going to be in the country where there was nomore anti
-
Sem itism , and there 
were no Nazis, and we were going to bef reeand we were going to live in a democratic 

so cie t y.  

>> Suzy Snyder: W ere your parents there to greet you?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: My f ather was there.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber what itf elt like to seehim after such a long time?
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It was wonderf ulto seehim .Soall the peoplegot off  the shipbutthe 

kids couldn't getoff  the ship because thedoctor had to get on totheship and he hadto check 

us all out to see if  we had som e kindof a comm unicabledisease. So he got tom y brother and 

m y brother says he had bigflu but I'm  telling you, hehad a big rashall over his bodyf rom  

eating all of that pineapple.So they saw thatandthey saidhe can'tcom e into the United 

S ta te s.
 

 
So what were they going to do with him ? Didanybody guess what they with him? Can 
anybody guess? 
 
>> 
[Inaudible] 
 
>>
 
SusanW arsinger: Yeah, this lady said Ellis Island. That's right. T he island right next to the 
Statue of Liberty. If  you couldn't get intotheUnited States, you went to Ellis Island. So they 

said he has to be quarantined until they f igure out what's wrong. I tried to explain to him  itwas 

a rashbecauseof eating all of  thepineapple. So they putus on Ellis Island and wef oundout 

all about the UnitedStates. 
 
 
I'll tell you what we f ound out. Do you want to hear? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Yes.
 
>> 
[Inaudible]
 

12
 
 
>
> SusanW arsinger: No. They wouldn't letus on to the land. And evidently they m ust have 
toldm y f ather we were going to Ellis Island and they would get in touch with him as to what 
happened. 
 
 
Sof irst of all, we used to eat on these long tables. Andon thetables they had this 
white breadand it was high like this with slices, and we had never seen white bread. I took a 

pieceand squashed it in m y handsand madea little ball. And som ebody toldme it was called 

W onde r
 B
read. And Ithoughtthat was really,  really great. 
 
 
And thenm y brother was sitting next to a sailor and he was drinking this brown drink 
and it had bubbles. And the sailor said to take a taste. My brother lookedatm e. I said, well, do 

it. And sohe took it. And he said, Oh, it tastes really good. And thesailor toldhim  it was 

Co c a
-
Co la .
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: And then we heard that all the children in theUnited States could have 

candy in their m outh and keep it all day long.
 
 
So we were prepared to com e backand enter the U
nited States. So anywa y, m y 
brother's rash got better and they m usthavegotten in touch with m y father and we got 

togetherand he took us toW ashington where m y m other andthe baby were. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder: W e're almostoutof  tim e as far as we want to leave som e tim ef or questions, 

answers, but I want to know brief ly if  you candescribe what was life
 
--
 
do you remember what 
lif e was like being reunited with your parentsand getting used to living in the United States? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, it was wonderf ul to be with our parents.It was di
ff icult f or m e to go 
to  s
chool because they put m e in the seventhgrade. 
 
 
Is there a seventh grader hereby any chance? Oh, yeah. One.
 
 
So anyway, so I didn't know how to speak English too well. And in those days the
y 
hadhom ogeneous grouping, which m eant they put all the sm art kids in one classand the 

dumb ones in the other one and all them iddle ones in between.So they putm e in that class 

because I didn't know how to speak any English. And all theproblem  kids were in that class, 

andI just couldn't believe, you know, what the kids
 
--
 
didn'tdotheir hom ework and they 
chewed gum  in the classroom . I couldn't believe it. One kidf ell asleep in class. I couldn't 

believe that was going on because tom ea teacher was the highestthing in the whole wide 

world next to your parents.
 
But later I learnedhow to speak English andthings got to be a little 
b it b ette r. 
 
 
But you kids, how m any of  you are students in the school system?Yeah, a lot. well, I'll 
tell you. You're very lu cky. Be happy that you have such wonderf ul teachers because in those 

days, you know, theteachers didn't really understand individual kids and they didn't 

understand the needsof an imm igrant child.T hey didn'thave the classes thatthe kids have 

toda
y. If  you'rean immigrant, you know, you get taken out and you learn how to speak. Itwas 

ver y diff icult.I hada hard time. Buteventually ever ything turned out all right.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Let's open itup to af ew questions. Let me repeatthe question so
 
tha t we  
can get it in case we're reporting the program . 
 

>> 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat happened tothe wet m oney? 
 

>> SusanW arsinger: Oh, yeah. I didn't tell you.T he lady who tookm y brother and me across 

theborder, she didn't do itf orf ree.She wanted tohave a lot of money. And them oney, all the 

m oney thatm yf ather had saved, he gave to that lady to take us across the border.
 
I 'm  so r r y I 
didn't tell you before.
 

13
 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shesm uggled you across the border.
 
>> Susan W arsinger
:  Ye s. 
 
>> 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Joseph
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hequestion is,W hat does Joseph do?
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  I canbrag abouthim . He's a cardiologist. He saved a lot of people. Now 
he's retired because he's just a year younger than Iam. And he used to live in Long Islandbut 

now his wif e
 
--
 
his kids are all grown up anddoing well. He's got lots of  grandchildren. Sohe 
lives in an apartmenton top of the
 
--
 
not the highest. One of the f ancy hotels. Do you know 
where the tip of  New York is called
, 
the battery? And the tip of  New York
 
--
 
what's the name?
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Mille nnium ?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Ritz Carlton, yes. You'r e right. Soanywa y, ontopof  the Ritz Carlton 

they have som ebeautiful apartments with windows thataref acing, guess what.
 
>> 
[Inaudible]
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T hat's right.T hat's where he lives now in thewinter of  his life. He did a 

lot and he contributeda lot to the UnitedStates.
 
 
And theother brother,Ernest,the baby, he was aphysicist for NASA. Some ofhis 
experim ents wentup into space. Hedid a lotof  work with theozone, theair. So he contributed 

a lot to our society. And he has lotsof  children and grandchildren. 
 
 
So the Nazis didn'taccomplish what they setout to do.
 
 T
hey contributeda lotbut when youthinkof all of  those six m illion Jews that they 
killed, all of m y relatives are in that six m illion, look at all of the things that thosepeople could 

have given to soci
e ty. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Correct.
 
 
Brief ly, how did your parentsand your younger brother get to the UnitedStates?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Ok. Letm e tell you what happened. Remember I told you about that 

lady who owned thepicklef actory? She kepton bugging ever ybody,  the HIAS,the State 

Departm ent, anybody she could think of. Sofinally she got enoughaff idavits to get m yf ather. 

And sheprom ised that he would notbea burdento the UnitedStates, that she would take 

care of him, make sure he had a job. So 
s
hehadenough papers toget m y father here. 
 
 
So he cam e here andhe startedto work. Hesold eggs to the Jewish people. He used 
to buy eggs f rom farmers, candle them , andthen sell them  it. So hesaved enoughm oney so 

thatm y m otherand the baby could come to the United States. So whenthey were all here 

together,that's when they started lookingf orus. 
 
>> 
Did you have m orethan one teacher? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Canyou repeat the question?
 
>> 
Did you have two teachers orone? 
 
> >  S u s a n W ar s i n ger :  W hen I  w
as in seventh grade? 
 
>> 
Ye s .
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ehad more thanone teacher.W e wentf rom  one teacher to the other. 

But we were together,the class was alwa ys together.Let's say, one teacher taught us math 

but it was all of ustogether. Oneteacher taught us reading.Anotherteacher taught us social 

studies, whatever it wa s.
 
 
But I remember later on, I was taking a course in chem istry and it was a little later. 
And I knew how to speak English a little bitby then. Just to tell you about this teacher. I
t ' s 
never going to happento you again.
 
She didn't understand at all.She used to
 
--
 
I wa n te d to 

14
 
 
please her.She used to call on me andI wasn't quite sure. So oneday she said som ething 
andthen she said
 
--
 
by that time I was Susan but shedidn't remember
 
m y nam e so she called 
m e Hilda, and I don't know why, becausem y last nam e was Hilsenrath. 
 
 
So, anywa y, she called onm eand she said
,  ﬁC
lear as m ud
? ﬂ O
f  course, you know I 
didn't get it. And I said, yes. Andall the kids and she
, 
they laughed at me. So it was a very sad 
experience thatI rem ember. But, you know, later on Ibecame ateacher and I said tom yself, 

I'm  never going to dothat tom y students.
 
Anywa y, I learnedf rom  her what nottodo. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W ehave a question here inf ront.
 
>> 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hequestion is, 
W
hat happened to your parents' extendedfam ily? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Ok. My grandparents
 
--
 
m y f ather's parents and m any of  his sisters and 
brothers, except one, they lived in Poland. And in Poland the Jews didn't even go to the 

concentration cam ps.They didn't go to the ghettos.W hen the Nazis came into the town, they 

m ade them m arch intothe woodsand they madethem dig their graves and they shotthem  

andtheyf ell into the graves
.  
 
On m yf ather's side, I never found anybody that survi ved except one of his sisters that 
had lef t to go to Israelway beforehand. So Ihave her.She'sa cousin.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm e clarif y. Susi'sfather's f am ily was on theeastern side of Poland. 

Wh
en the Nazisf irst im plem ented genocide, they started with this process of  killing into open 
gra ves andthen they quickly sa w that was not going to work. T owards western Poland, those 

Jews actually did endup in concentration cam ps.But, again, it was
 
--
 S
usi's correct, that there 
was this policy of m ass shootingf irst.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Because Itried tof ind them. And there'sno record of them atall. And 

the Germans kept very good records.
 
 
Now, m y m other'sparents also lived in Poland but all of m y mother's sisters lived in 
Germ any. T hey were all Germ an. One I wrote a story about. Her nam e wasT anta Anna, m y 

m other's aunt, she took care of m y mother. She was like m y grandmotheronly she was m y 

aunt. And what happened to her, I found her and her husba
nd andm y great grandm other 

whom  she caredfor and they were killed. T hey died in Riga. And all the other aunts, Idon't 

know what happened to them . Inever found them, andall of  theother relatives I didnotf ind 

t h em .
 
 
Just lately, a grandchild of Tanta
 
Anna sent a letter to the m useum  and h
e  s a i d t o t h e 
m useum , who is thisSusan W arsinger?They didn't know m y last nam e. It turned out it was 

m e. And he's m y thirdcousin.So we're writin g to each other.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Found a relative ver y m uchlater, which is wonderful.
 
 
I'm  going toactually ask

f riends andthe visitors  here in the audience to rejoice in thef act that we are living in a

democratic society and that all of us should make sure that no dictatorship would ever usurp 
our liberties.
 
 
W eneed to rem em bertheatrocities that happened tof am ilies during the Holocaust 
andpassthis inform ation on to our progeny. W eneed to learnf rom this horror inour history. 

W ecannotundo the atrocities of  thepast. But besides remem bering, we have to take action to 

conf ront hate.W hen we see injusticetaking place, we have to do som ething about it.W e 

cannot be onlookers.Wehave tobe sensitive toeach other and we have to take careof  each 

other.
 
 
People askm e why do I volunteer in thism useum
. T h e y s a y, H o
w c an you do this 
over and over? How can I not? Giving tours to our visitors, throughour perm anent exhibit, 

hopef ully teaches them  what hatred and prejudice can do to p
eople.
 
W hen touring law 
enf orcementoff icersand future FBI agents, Ihope that they understandtheir role when 

encounters atrocities. 
 

 
W e cannot be bystanders and def initely not be collaborators.
 
There are threats of  
genocide in many parts of  the world at thepresent time.W e cannotbe indiff erent to em erging 

threatsof  genocide and mass atrocities. Allof us need to be aware about what is happening 

and we needto work together to take thenecessary actions to preventpeoplef rom being 

m urderedfor this sim ple reason thatthey aredifferent.
 
Never againdo we want to stand by 
and do nothing.
