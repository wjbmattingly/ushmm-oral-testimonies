presentation to help wi th her introduction. 
 
 
Halina Litm an was born in Krakow, Poland, December
 
12,1932. Poland is to the right 
o f  G e rm
any on thism ap.
 
 
T he arrow shows the location of Krakow.  Halina was the daughterof
 
Ignacy 
and Olga 
Litm an. In this photograph we see Halina with herm otherand herAuntIrka in1938.
 
 
Halina, her mother and sister survi ved the war  in Jaroslaw underf alse papers 
identif ying thefam ily as Catholics. Onthe way to Jaroslaw, thefam ily encountered aPolish 
m an who threatenedto reveal their identity.  Halina'sm other strucka bargain
 
with the m an 
using their ticketsf or luggage, all the money she had
, 
and 
the coats they were wearing.
 
 
T his is thehouse where Halinaand herfam ily stayed in Jaroslaw.  In this photograph, 
Halina and her sister Eva celebrate Christm as while in hiding.
 
 
Halina's mother decided the safestplacetohide was in plain sight
.  She f
ounda job at 
a Germ an headquarters peeling potatoesforGerm an troops.T his is a photograph of Halina's 

m other and two Polish co
-
workers at the Germ an headquarters where Olga worked.
 
 
Af ter the war, Halinaand herf am ily im m igrated to England. 
 
 
Ha lin a  live s  in  
B e t he s da
, Maryland.  Herhusband Richard passed awa y in 2011.  She 
has two sons, one who lives in England,and the other just 10 m inutes away as Halina notes.  

Shehas two granddaughters, Hannah, 16, Olivia, 10.  Hannah will b e producing af ilm  abo
u t 
her grandm other f or a school project.
 
 
Halinaf requently travels to England to see her son andher sisterand herfam ily.  In 
A p ri l
 
2011, Halina andsom e of the other survivors f rom herhom etown went there to place a

m onum ent on an unmarked grave in which 800 Jews were buried.
 
 
Halina continues her keen interest in sportswhich, you will hear later, have been a 
particular importance in her lif e because her m other was a Polish swim m ing champion in1925. 
 
L
ast year Halina and her sister Eva traveled to Polandto visit anexhibit of Jewish athletes in 
Krakow which included herm other. She will a lso visit her fam ily in England and Israel this 
year.
 
 
Halina speaksf requently about her experience during the Holocaust at schoolsas well 
as here atthe museum and in other settings.
  
W ith that
,  
I'd like toask you to join me in 
welcom ing our
 
F i rs t  P ers on

Halina Peabody.
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
Ha lin a
, t
hank youfor joining us and being will i ng to be our
 
F i rs t  P e rson
. W ehave just 
an hour. W em ight even have two or threeextra m inutes becausewe started abit early.  You 
have som uch to share with us. We're going to jump right in.
 
 
You toldm e thatfor you
r 
lif e was beautif ul inyour early years bef ore Germany 
invaded Poland in September
 
19 3 9 s t a r t i n gW or ld  War  I I.   L
et's start the conversationtoday 
with you telling us a little bitabout yourf am ily, your comm unity
,  
andyou bef ore the war began. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  As you m entioned, I was born in Krakow.  However, we did not live there.  
My m other just wentto her m o
ther
 
--
 
m y m ot he r
.  W
hen she married
, 
m y fa th
e r, a  d en tist, 
wanted to have a smaller town where he could startdental surgery.  Krakow was f ull of that.  

So they m oved to a place called Zaleszcyki.  T oday it's Ukraine.  You saw themap.
 
I t ' s  lik e
 
--
 
i t  wa s
 
like a riverside town.  It was com pletely surroundedby water.  Not completely

butabout90%. So you had kayaks,beaches.  You could gof rom  the shady beach tothe 
sunny beach. My m other was ver y happy because she was a swimm er
,  
so she loved the 
wa te r. 
 
So she usedtohave a kayak. She used to water ski.  Ihada little paddle
; u
sed to 
kayak around.  I had bicycles and tricycles.  Iwas prom iseda grandpianof rom  m y 
grandparents as the f irst child.
 
 
My m other was also awonderful knitter.  Shewould knit not only wool but lace.  And 
all our stuff at home was made out of her work.  It was lacy curtains. W ehad all kinds of 
em broidery.  She was ver y, very talented inthatarea. She usedtoknit little outf itsform y 
Shirley T em ple 
doll.  Those
 
are wonderful mem oriesof those years that I had.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm om , yourm other and your f ather, taught you many skills ver y earl y in 

lif e. W ill you say som ething aboutthat?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  I was just about to say. My m other taughtm eto embroider and to knit.  I 

can't rem em ber ever not knowing how to.  Itwas all donebeforemy m any m emories.
 
 
My f atherdecided I had to bea genius, soI had to be able to read a paper beforeI 
went to kindergarten. So he taughtm eto read and write in Polish. I don't remem berany of  it
.  
M
y m other used to tell m e.  But Idon't remember that. All I knew, I've always known how t o 
read and write in Polish to this day.  So that really stoodm e in very good steadduring thewar. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In September
 
19 3 9,  of  
course, all that would change when Germ any invaded 
Polandf rom  the west.  The Soviets then invaded thepart of Polandwhere you li ved.  Andyour 
town was soon underRussian occupation.  It was initiall y thought that only the men were in 
danger
,  
s o m a n y of  
them f led over abridge into Romania.  Yourfather had secondthoughts.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

T ell us about that. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: The thought was thatthey were basing them selves on the FirstW orld 
W ar where them en were conscripted intothe Russian Arm y, wom en and children were not 
touched.  So m yf ather, as m any others, some with fam ilies, ran over because it was very e asy 
to go to Romania.  You just crossed over a bridge.  So a lot of people went, including m y 
father.  He was not wanting to takeus because m y sister was
 
born two m onths before thewar.  
So there was ababy at hom e. So he didn'tf eel that he could take afam ily, wondering about
 
if  
there would be m ilk f or her
 
and what kind of conditions.  
 
 
So in the rush,they all rushedover. W e stayed back home. The R
ussians
 
occupied 
us.  I was not quite7
 
years old, so I don't remem ber all the details. I don't remem ber the 
Russians so well that tim e.  But I knew thatmy f ather
 
--
 
we lost af ather because he lef t.  
 
 
Howe ver, about someweeks later 
--
 
the weather in Zaleszc yki was ver y hot in the 
summ er and very cold in the winter.  So in the winter the river was com pletely solid and you 

could just walk over it.  Andthat's what thesepeople who decided to come back, they decided 
to cross back. And m y father was oneof  them . Af terall, they left businesses andf am ilies and 
children. Sothey decided, you know, maybe things have settleddown.  T hey just tried to 
cross back. However, the Russians sealed the border by then. They were all caught.  My 
father was put on trial. They said he was a spy.  A dentist, a spy?  Yeah. W ell, because he 
went back andforth. That's why they said hewas a spy.  T hey gave him  20 years' hard labor.  
My m other went to say goodbye to him, and that was the lasttim e we saw him .  He was t
aken 
away.  He was sent toSiberia.

W ehad little correspondence with him butnot m uch afterwards. W e, as af am ily of a 
c rim in a l 
--
 
m y father was called a crim inal becausehe was sentenced, so thefam ily under the 
Russian law, we were supposed to be also
 
taken to Russia.  And we were all packed, 
r e ady t o  
go.  Butf or som e reason,never found out why
 
they didn't take us. Somebody spokeupfor us 
or something. Anywa y, we were not sent to Russia.  At thattim e we thought we were save d.
 
Howe ver, we were thrown out of the house. Wehad tom ove up the road. T here was another 
little town calledT luste where we spent the Russianoccupation.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereany of 
y
our other relatives taken to Siberia during that sam e time?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  My two aunts,one f rom W arsaw, onef rom  Krakow, cam e toour 
area, to our house in 1939, when the war broke out because they were more af raid of the 
Germ an occupationthan the Russian occupation. Sothey cam eover to us.  At onepoint the 
Russians offered them a deal. They said you can goback to the Germ an side,and as with m y 
father's group, you know, they decidedthat itwas tim e to goback, ever ything was sort of  
settled in. So they lef t businesses andhom es
,  
so they wanted to go back.  Sothey signedup.
 
 
As usually with the Russian offers, it was a ruse.  Oneof m y aunts was notfeeling 
well, was sick.  Andfor some reasonthe Russian was nice and lefther with her husband. 
Sh e
 
--
 
m y other aunt,m y cousin andm y
 
uncle
, were taken to Russia. T hey have
 
--
 
they had a 
ver y hard tim e in Siberia but did survi ve there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So rem aining cost her
 
her
 
l if e .
 
>> Halina Peabody:  And could have costours, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.  You could have been sent to Siberia as 
we l l
.

>> Halina Peabody: W e were supposed tobe.  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.  To the extent you know, what was lif e like while underthe 
Russian occupation? Your father's gone. Livelihood is gone.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right.  The children were dropped one class. So instea
d of  go i n g to  

kindergarten,I went tosom e little, you know, like one class below.  W hat they wanted to do 
was to teach us Russian andto teach ustheComm unist mantra.  So I rem em ber going to 
schoola little bit and learning Russian. Very vaguel y, but Ido rem em berthat they tried to 
teach us. They tried to bring Comm unism  into ourm idst.  AsI said,at that age, you didn't 
really have a big im pact on m e.  I enjoyedtheir singing, though. T heArmy used to sing 
beautif ully. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were about 81/2 when the Germ ans turned on the Russiansand quickly, 

swif tly, cam e andoccupied your town. T hen,of  course, things turned dramatically worse.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  First of all, whenthe Germ ans cam e 
to  
us, theRussians just 
disappeared. T hey left.  And we went back to our house.  So we settled back into 
Za leszcyki,  
into our house. W e awaited the next occupants.  Nobody knew what to expect.  Everybody 
was obviousl y ver y tense.  My poorm other had this baby.  She was having troublefeeding her.  
Th
ere was no visible meansof any income either as well.  I don't know what we lived on allof  
those months.
  
Friends, we had goodfriends.
  
I t
hink that they helped mostly.
 
 
W e were waiting, just wanting to cooperate as bestas we could. W henthe Germans 
a
rrived, they put inall of  thosenew rules.  No schoolsfor 
J
ewish children, f irst of  all.  T here 
was a curfew.  T hey told us that we m ustputyello w stars, yello w ar m  bands.  Everybody was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
ver y, very scared, I have to say. W edidn't go out if  we didn't have to.
 
 
T hef act was that we, as I said, we all wanted to cooperate.  I know that they said that 
ever y Jewish person had to be working f or the Germ ans.  So it didn't matter if there was no 
particular jobf or them . They were told to clean the sidewalks
, t
o that extent. 
 
 
A s I sa id,m y m o the r
 
--
 
they knew everything about everybody.  My m other was a 
knitter. So they m ade her the chief knitterf orthem ayor of the town,the German,of  course, 
because he had lots of children. So m y mother was knitting for his children. And everybody 
else was work
i n g 
f or the Germ ans.   
 
>> Bill Benson: T here was this terrible incidence where young menand women were taken to 

the woods. W ill you tell us about that?
 
>> Halina Peabody: That was next. T hey created a Jewish leadership group there
, 
T h e 
leadersof  the Jewish comm unity.  T hey work ed through them
, w
hatever they needed.  T hey 
usedto get groups of people to gooutto work for them in thefarm  country.  So they hadall 

kinds of jobstodo. And they would take a groupof  young people to do some jobs.  In the 
evening they would com e back.
 
 
As I said, we were all working and hopingf or thebest. T henthey dem andeda big 
group of  volunteers to go up. They w
e
re supposed to be binding treesf or the winter. W inter 
wa s  v
er y harsh sonobody had any suspicions.
 
>> Bill Benson: T o wrap bags around thetrees?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Burlap around the trunks of  the trees so they wouldn't die in the cold.  A 

lot of people went,even volunteered.T hey were marched up the road. Th
e place they were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
supposedtodo this job was an old m ilitary, Polishm ilitary, cam p
; j
ust up the road, out of  sight 
of  the town.  They wer e marched up. W hoever theyf oundonthe way, they marched,they 
added, and they were m arched up.  
 
 
W e  wa it
ed f
o r t h
em  tocom e back asnormally you would.  Nobody was com ing back.  
W e waited. W e waited.  W e were anxious.
  
Finally, towards the evening, a mandragged 
him self back in.  He told what happened.  Hewas the only survi vor of that group.W hat 
happened was that
 
hewas shot, but they m issed hisheart. T hey hit his arm.  Hetoldus that 
when the group got there, theyf ound an open grave over which there were planksof  wood.  

T hey were told to undress
 a
nd lay over those planks.  And they wer e shot. As they were s
h o t, 
they were dropping into the grave and this man who survived was one of the last peopleto fall 

in.  AsI said, they m issed hisheart. T hey didn't cover them  very wel l.  They didn't have to. 
T hey didn't care.  Sohe managed to drag him self outand cam eback and told the story.  And 
that's when wef ound out, when we realized,what was happening. Because up to thispoint 
we were cooperating
;  we
 
thought we were being just occupied.  But then we wondered what 
was in store f or everyb ody.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
I n a ddi t i o n  t o t he  da y

day brutality of  the Germ ans they would dothese 
periodic a
ktions
.  And there were several of  them . T here was onethat I think was of a very 
close callf or you in which your m other
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: That was later,much later.  Letm ef irst say wh at happened to the next 

onebecause we were all waiting to see whatwas going to be the next. 
 
 
W hat happened was when the order came, the next one,they needed a certain 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
numberof  people to work in Germ any.  Again, that could have beentrue because they needed 
people to work in Germ any, but we alreadyknew that this may notbe true. Everybody tri ed to 
hide.
  
My m other tookboth m y sister andm eto our cook, the lady who usedto come and cook 
for us. That's where we spent theday. T hat's how we sur vi ved that day.
  
T hey got the right 
numberof  people. And then we went backhom e.  
 
 
Andat thatpoint the Germ ans decided that this was a sm all Jewish comm unity so 
there weren't that many of us lef t. T hey did not want to have to drag and lookfor us.  So what 
they
 
did 
is they threw
 
all the Jews out of  Zaleszc yki, the rest of the Jewish com m unity
, a
nd 
threw us into the same town that we were during the Russian occupation, toT luste. And there 

we f oundnot only the rem nants of our Jewish comm unity, butthe rem nantsof  the comm unities 
around us where they did the sam e thing. And whatever was lef t,they didn't want to have the 
trouble, so they put usall together intothisT luste.W e hada sort of communal hom es. It 
turned into a ghetto later.  Right then it was just a groupof people living together in close 
quarters.  It was a Jewish quarter.
 
 
Again,f irst thing they starteddoing was looking f or hiding places because we already 
knew that thenext thing is going to be, again, they'll nee
d to take us out again. 
 
My m other 
said to me that it'snot going to helpbecausethey're going to move us again.  That's the whole 

pattern. They wil l kill a s many as they can, and then they'll m ove us together again. So we 
would lose the hiding places. 
 
She started looking f or ways to get out and to save us,the 
children. But, of course, there was no way.  During this whole tim eshe tried to send to 

Rom ania.  Nothing worked.

Bef ore she had a chance to lookfor anythingelse, though, another order came 
that 
they needed a group of  peopletobe senttoGerm any for work.  Ofcourse,everybody was  
ready with the hiding places.  My m otherdid not want to hide under the house.  Shehad met a 
couple of farmers.  She had known a couplef rom  theprevious trip. So she decided to hide
 
w
ith t wo farm ers
.  S
heputm e in one loft there with onefarm er
 
an
d in theother one she paid 
the lady in advanceto keepher andm y sister during the day while they were looking f or 
people to collect.
 
 
So all day long I wondered, you
 
know, what's happening to m y m other. T he lady 
hiding m e saidthey were collecting them  in the square, that she saw this person. I knew 
ever ybody.  Thisf riend, thatf riend was there. I kept thinking m y m other was caught. And 
that'show I stayed all day because I was sure m y mother was caught.
 
 
T owards the endof  the day, however, m y m other did come to pickme up with m y 
sister.  She toldm e what happened to her. The lady who kept her just got nervous and 
scared. She threw her out of  thehouse withm y
 
sister in the m iddleof  the day.  She saidthere 
was an empty f ield with one bush.  She crouchedby this bush with m y sister for the restof the 

day while they were looking for stragglers.  She said it was am iracle they didn't see them  
because they were with airplanes and
 
--
 
youknow, looking around for people. And som ehow, 
as I said, som e m iracle, they didn't see them .
 
 
At the endof  theday, m y m other, as I said,when she came to pick m e up, she 
thought I was taken. She was convinced thatI was caught.  So we both went through this.  

And she said
:  W
e're not going todo this again. W e're going to stay together. And whatever 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
happenstous, we will go together. And thatwas her decision.  
 
 
Of course, we knew that this was not theend of  the story.  So she start
ed
 
again 
lookingf or ways what could she do. And they cam e up with this idea that since we were all 
wom en, that if we could get papers,falsepapers, thatm aybe we had a chance to survive.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you talk about that stage when your m other did that, wasn't therealso 

a point where your mother prepared tohave you go with your younger sister
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: To Romania.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were so young. She was gi ving you instructions onhow to carefor your 
sist e r.   T h at
 
m usthave been so painful. Tellus about that.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, that was when she was tryin g to get usout.T here was som enight 

trips to Rom ania. She was explaining to m eto wash the hair, keep it clean.  I was just so 
upset because I didn'twant to do it. I didn't want to go. Ifm y m other said do this,I listened.  In 
theend it didn't work out.  I was relieved.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So she triedeverything.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She tried everything.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Andf inally decided shehad to get new identitiesfor you.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That was the optionthat it came to.
  
So they got the papers f rom  the 
priest. W iththehelp of ourf riends,again, they took us to the station and put usonthe train.
 
My m other decided that we would go to
 
a place called Jaroslaw.  Jaroslaw was a little bit 
bigger thanT luste andsort of onthe way to Krakow.  I don't know the reason,again,for that 

town, butthat was what they decided todoand we said goodbye toever ybody.

T his was going to be a long trip.  It was warti m e, and the trains were not very 
comfortable. W e're going to bef our days and four nights with changes.  My m other was 
carryin g m y sister. W e had two suitcases
, 
which was all we had lef t of our possessions
, a
nd  
we started on our trip
; 
m
ade ourselves hom eon the train, sat down.
 
 
As we were travelin g, a young m an attachedhim self tous and started talking.  Onthe 
train people talk. Just sat next to usand started talking tom y m other about the children.  

Altogether very f riendly and ch
atty.
 
 
As soon asthe train went on,m y m other toldm ethat he kept pushing and pushing her 
because he keptasking about the Jewish
 
--
 
you know, if  your greatgrandfather was Jewis h, it 
was enough
; y
ou were Jewish.  Buthepushed her so hard
 
she saidshe couldn't take it 
anym ore. So sheadmitted that we were Jewi sh.  Andat this point he said, well, I'm  going to 

Jaroslaw, too. I'm  going to accom pany you, but when we get there
 
Ihave to turn you over to 
the Gestapo, of  course.
  
My m other understood that. T hat's how we started traveling, knowin g 
that when we get to Jaroslaw, we're going to be turned over to theGestapo.
 
 
I know that m y mother was m ostly concernedabout the suff ering of the children.  She 
knew that we would be separated and taken awa y.  T his
 
was her worst nightmare.  She didn't 
care atallf orherself. She wouldhave letherself be quartered like any mother would
, b
ut she 
just didn't know what else could shedo.
  
 
 
So as we were traveling, she was thinking
 w
hen we get tothe Gestapo, couldthey just 
shoot usall together im mediately because Idon't wanttobeparted f rom my children.  And she 
off ered them  the tickets for the suitcasesand the coats that you saw on our backs. Because

she said that was the thing
 
--
 
that was the best she couldf igure outwhat to do.  
 
 
And that's how we traveled,fourdays andf our nights.  It was very, very exhausting, 
as you can im agine. W e weref ull of lice. If you puta com bthrough m y hair, youhad lice.  
And the clothes were full of  lice.
  
As we were traveling, he was looking af ter us very caref ully.  
He always had m y sister and me inhis sights.  And eventually m y m other told me what she 

decided and what she asked him  to do.
 
 
So when we reached Jaroslaw, we were completely exhausted, as you can imagine, 
four days andfour nights onthe train. It was terrible.  But as we were coming downf rom  the 
train, I suddenly realized thathe was going to take usto theGestapo to be shot. I didn'twant 
that.  Sim pleas that.  Istartedthinking Idon'twant to die.
  
Andas we were walking to the 
Gestapo,I startedpulling at m y mother and saying, " I don't want todie."  And she said tohim
:  
L
ook, you know, she's blond, young, maybe she would be able to survi ve
 
by herself. W hy 
don't you let her go? And I said,
ﬂN
o,
 
Idon'twant to go by m yself.  I want you to com e, too.
ﬂ  
So we keep walking
, w
alking towards the Gestapo.  
 
 
At thatpoint, asI said, I was pulling at her.  She didn't know what todo.  Andf inally 
she said to him:  Look, do youhave childrenof  your ow
n?
ﬂ
  
And hesaid yes.  And she said to 
h im ,  "
W
hy do you want this on your conscious?  I've given you ever yt hing 
we
 
have.  Just take 
it.  Just let us go and try our luck."   Andhedid.  Andthis was something that was oneof  those 
m iracles thathappened. W ehad afew of them
, b
ut this was the one of them.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Halina,having just 
n
ow escaped that very, ver y scar y situation, youhad 
false papersas Catholics, but it was m ore than having false papers
; y
ou had to assum e a new

identity as kids. 
 
How did your m other prepare you to becom e something you were not sothat 
you could pass any interrogations
;  
that you couldpassfor what you were not? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  First of  all,m y sister was too young.  She didn'tknow anything. W edidn't 
t e ll h
er anything.  Secondly, I was a kid as well.  My m otherdid sitme down and toldm e, 
bef ore we left,m y new nam e,m y grandparents, m y birthdate.  I knew all of  that.  Ihad very 

scant knowledge about the church. W e didn'tattend synagogue,either, so I had nothing to 
basem yself on.  But Iknew I had to cross m yself in andout.  Ithinkthat's all I knew.
 
 
W ell, we didn't know anything m ore. I also didn't have anybody toask becauseonce 
we lef t, you know, we were on our own.  I guess it was just living in hope. W edidnot know if  
thepapers were real or not. To this day
 
--
 
they are here in thism useum, but I don't know if  
those papers were real or not. T hey didn'thave com puters thosedays to check.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that person's namem ay not have 
existed.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Or m aybe he was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nearby.  So here you are in this new town with no m oney.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No money, no nothing
; j
ust m y mother carrying m y sister and hadm eby 
thehand. W e're walki ng in the 
m
ain 
s
tree t.
  
My m other sees a little cafe.  She walks into the 
caf e.  He had lef t a f ew 
m unze 
f o r m y sist e r'sm ilk.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Afew coins.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  It was like a few dollars. Paper money.  Ithinkthey were also in coins.  

Anyway, so we walk in there.  My m other askedfor the m ilkfor m y sister.  W e sitdown.  She 
started looking around.  She asks if there was anybody who knew ofa place where we could 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

17
 
f ind lodgings f or thenight.  Because we needed to be som ewhere inside.  It was ver y im portant 
not
 
to be straggling around the streets because there were Germansgoing around with guns 
at the ready.  Didn'tneedm uch to just pull the trigger.
 
 
At any rate, onem an got up and said thatheknew a lady, a washerwom an, who took 
lodgers in.  He saidhewould be glad to justtake usover there. It was very close by. 
 
He  
brought us over there.  The lady, a tiny little lady, ver y s weet
, s
he looked at us. W e were 
bedraggledf rom  the trip,m other and two kids.  She says she'll takeus in.  Her son
 
said, " D
on't
 
takeher in. Don't."   He had suspicions. Butshe said, no, she said,"
T
his is am otherand two 
children. I have to take her in."  Another one of  those m iracles.
 
 
So she took us in.  My m other said
:  L o
ok, Ihave nom oney, nothing
 b
utthe next day, 
t o mo
rrow, I wi ll go to work.  I will f ind som e job. W hatever I earn, I'll bring to youf or keeping 
us.  Andthat's what she did.  She tookaf ew other jobs. She didhousekeeping
 
wh
erever she 
could. She changed jobs a few tim es.  
 
 
She was very wor ried about
 
af ew things.  My sister was ver y sickl y. W e had to leave 
her
 
--
 
she had to go to work.
  
M y sister had very curly hair.  T hat's very lo vel y, but it's an af ro.  
And in Polandthe girls have straight, blond hair.  So if you had curly hair, that really 
m ean
t th a t 
you're Jewish.  T he Pols were very good at recognizin g Jews.  Shewas terrif ied
 s
om e b ody 

would point. So that was one
 
--
 
atone point she just shavedoff herhair com pletely.
 
 
E xcu se  m e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Shaved off herhair to avoid even having to
 
deal with the issue. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Exactl y.  Shedid it twice.

I went to school
 
--
 
Polish kids were allowed to go totwo hours of school. I hadone 
hour of religion, andone hour of  general studies.  Now, this is where I 
learned a little bit abou
t 
the church.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you had an hour ofreligious study ever y day.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. The way they taught Catholic religion was by catechism . They don't 
do it today, I don't think.  But you had questions and answers.  Andbecause I could read and 
write , so  I 
c
aughtuppretty quickl y.  So I wasoneof  the star pupilsfor thepriests. 
 
 
Of course, Ihad tobeterribly caref ul because anything couldhave given meaway.  
W edidn'thave a slip of paper, nothing.  But still, you know, you could just give yourself  away 
ver y easily.  So I had to be very m uch careful nottodo that.
  
 
 
My m other and I were two little partners.W ewere the only two thatknew who we 
we r e
,  
so we had to always be very caref ul how we com municated.
  
My m other kep
t  wo rry i ng 
about, very m uch,about thefact that we could be given awa y on any little thing.  So this was 

thedaily routine that we worried about whether we said something or did som ething.  You 
know, anything like that, that couldhave give n usaway.
 
 
I w
as sent to a guy who was partially Germ an across the street,a volunteer, to help 
him . Because he waspartially Germ an, he had right tohavef ree labor.  Andmy m other told 
him  thatI could darn socks.  So I was sent over there.  Ihelpedhim with peeling
 
s o m e 
potatoes or som ething in the kitchen, just a little helper there. 
 
 
T he lady who kept uswas ver y good at teaching us,m e,how to live.  Shetaughtme a 
lot of  things
, a
 
lotof  things.  She was a very n ice lady.  I don't know whether she suspected or
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
not.T hey never asked us.  It's only lately that I've been thinking that m aybe shedid suspect.  I 
think what they thought is maybem yf ather is Jewish or som ething like that. But as I said, they 
never asked.
 
>> Bill Benson: T here was one incident,how
e
ver, where the homewas raided where you 
were staying.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That was af terwards.  Yes.  My m other inher searchfor security changed 

the jobs af ew tim es. At one point sheoffered herself to work in Germ any becausethat wou
ld  
have been saf
er in that the G
e rm
ans 
neededpeople to work as Pols.  Not slave labor, just 
workin g f or theGermans.  But they didn't take usbecausem y sister was too young.
 
 
So the next thing she did, she decided
 
--
 
again, asI said, it was security.  All the tim e 
she 
was worried.  So she decided to apply f or a job in this m ilitary cam p, a Germanm ilitary 
cam p.  She wanted to have anID to say thatshe works for the Germ ans, that this was the 
thing.  Because the Germ ans, if  you workedfor them ,they were
 
--
 
they wouldn't question, 
wouldn't take you into the station.  If you work edfor them , you were let go.  They would catch 

you.  They would askfor papers.  But if  you showed that you were working, they would let you 
go .  Mo stly.
 
 
T he thing was that one of  the sonsof  thehostesses did aterrible thing.  He killed pigs 
for a living.  Under the Germ an law, the 
Pols, or no P
ols, they were not allowed to do that. 
Meat was a no
-
no.T hey were notallowed toslaughter pigs. T hey were al ways looking f or 
him .  They never f ound
 
him . But they were looking for him always.
  
Som y m other decided to 
apply to the Germ anmilitary cam p to get this ID that shefelt would be a little safer.

Now, during this tim ewe had one letterf rom ourf riends that we lef tbehind
 w
i t h  ve r y 
interestin
g news.  T hiswas also rather dangerous to get a letterf rom somewhere
, b
ut  t h is wa s 
too im portant that Ithink ourf riendsfelt we needed to know this.
  
My father sent a telegram  
through the Red Cross that he was saf e withhis sister in Palestine. W eknew there was apart 
of  thefam ily in Palestine. In those days it wa s all under the Britishm andate.  My aunt and four 
children andm y uncle, they went to Palestine in 1932.  But we knew ver y little about it. W e 
didn'teven know whic h town they were in but
 
by saying that us, weknew he was outof  Russia 
andhe was som ebody that we couldpossibly
,  
if we ever survi ved, som ebody to get usoutof  
Poland.
  
So we had that inform ation and it gave us a littlebit of a lif t.
 
 
T henm y m other,as I said, applied tothe Germ an m ilitary camp. They told her they 
have to check thedocum ents. Again, we lived infearfor weeks.  Idon't know whether they 
checked or not,but in the end it cam e through.  So she had an ID which shows that she works 
for the Germ ans.  Andthat'show we spent the rest of thatoccupation of Germany.
 
 
In them eantim e, we did get raided by the Germ ans one night, as you were 
m entioning. W hat they did is they come in the m iddle of the night scream ing, yelling with gu ns.  
"O
pen thedoor."  They came i
n .  "
E
verybody out."  T hey tookeverybodyf rom the houseto the 
station to checkthem out.  My m other showed her ID
, l
ookedat itand said, "
N
o, no, you stay."   
T he rest were taken into the station. T hey were checked out.T heyall checked out. Sothe 
ne
xt m orning they came back, but we avoided being checkedbecause this was the onefear.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you pointed out to me the great irony, unknown to them, those that were 

Jewish were left alone
.

>> Halina Peabody:  No.  They never didf indhim .
 
>> Bill Benson:  You, your mother and sisterwould li ve under thesecircumstances in constant 
fear but rem ain undetected. Your mother wor ked at the Germ an headquarters for the 
balance 
of  t h

on Jaroslaw, where you were livin g
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: W hich we didn't know anything about because we hadnopapers or 
radios.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfirst knowledge, there'sthisf iercef ighting going on around you.  Go 

ahead.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.  No
.  T
he thing is we didn't know anything that was going on at all.  
W hat happened was onem orning we woke up and there was com plete silence inthe street.  
No w,  t h is  is  a  
m
ain 
s
treet where thehorseand carts would go backandforth f rom early, early 
m orning because thefarm ers would bring contingents
 
and would just go backandf orth. So 
we were used to thenoise.  My m other was still in bed, was getting ready to go to work.  
Suddenly there'sthis silence. W ehad no idea what was happening.  
 
 
Out of this silenceI was standing by m y m other's bed.  I was up, standing by my 
m other's bed. Suddenly there was a tremendous bang.  Everything went black.  I started 

scream ing
, " M
y hand,m y hand."  My m other got up, grabbed me by thehand.We grabbed 
m y sister. W e walkedout
 
--
 
we walked through the kitchen intothestreet. The kitchen roof  
hadfallendown.  Yousaw the housethere.  It was just a roof. It was a that
ch 
roof at that tim e.  
Itf ell in. W e walked out.
  
My hand was bleeding.  My m other tried tof ind som ebody to take me

to the hospital, which was nearby, butnobody was there. So she walkedand took me by the 
happened to thehospital.  And inthe hospitalwe learned thatthe Germ ansprobably had run 
out 
and that the Russians were com ing in.  And there wasf ighting then. W hat we had was an 
artillery in the hospital. They were tr ying to get the planesdown.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You think it was a grenade or something thathit your house?
 
>> Halina Peabody: They thought it was a bom b.  I don't know.  I was hitby shrapnel.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were badly injured.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did 
you 
get treatm ent? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, thehospital was ver y good about this. T hey told
 
m y m o the r, 
though, because of all thedirt and it was anopen wound they would have to amputatem y 
hand.  So you can imagine m y m other. Shewas com pletely devastated.  I can't evenm ention 
it. 
 
 
T hey tookm e in. T hey cleanedm eup. W hat they eventually
 
did is they m anaged to 
save m y hand. T he nurses were nuns, Catholic nuns. T hey were beautif ul.  T hey had thebig 
white hats, you know, and the black. W e used toplay this game with m y mother.  One was 
really beautif ul. T hey had little blondhair com ing out here. T hey were very, ver y nice. T hey 
worked ver y hard savi ng m y hand.  I was in the hospitalfor two months. My hand,they had to 
straighten outm y hand.  They had to burn it live because there was no penicillin. T hey had to 
c
auterize
 
it.  It wa
s pretty painf ul. My m other usedto runf orm ilesnot to hear me scream . 
And thenun would say to m e,

>> Bill Benson:  Right. If I rem ember correctly, in the house,
 
the wom an who had taken you

a
t that tim e.  So we lost her.W e couldn't goback there.T here was nothing we could use 
there, so theneighbortookus in. I spent, asI said,two m onths in the hospital. Theneighbor 

tookus in. My m other kept going back andforth tothe hospital.
 
 
I said tom y m other, 
ﬁW
ell, now, I canat least say m y name.
ﬂ
  
And she said
 
n o, I ca n 't.  
And I said, "W hy?"  And she explained tomethatthere was a Pogrom , where af ew Jewish 
people that came out ofhiding got killedby the Pols. I'm  not saying all the
 P
ols were bad,but 
that was m y experience.  Ihad to keep quietas long asI was there. 
 
The lady, theneighbor 
who took us in,her son saidthat
 
Hit le r d idn ' t f in ish  h is  job .   Ye s .  S o.
 
 
My m other started knitting again to earna little bitof m oney so thatshe could put 
announcements to look for m yf ather. Eventually we didf ind him. But inthe meantime my 
m other was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctorasked me tohelpdecide tohave the 
operation.T hey didnot have any wa y to m ake sure that it was, but they said, you know, we 
don't wantto see youorphaned.  So they asked her tohave it andshe did have theoperation.
 
 
W edidf indm y f ather in the end. He sentm y cousinf rom Palestine.  In those days it 
was Palestine. My cousin came andput us
 
in touch with a Jewish agency. W e wentf rom

there to near Krakow.  And thenf rom  Krakow we registered with theJewish agency.  And 
eventually we went toBerlin.  And then m yf ather
 
--
 
turnedoutthat he was with the Polishunit 
that came outof  Russia le
gally
 a
f ter Stalin allowed some po
litical prisoners out. It was 
G
eneralAnders who was asked to create a unit.  He was stationed in Egypt.  He was
 
--
 
being 
a dentist,he was am edical off icerf or the whole unit.  He had the right, as part of the British 

A

>> Bill Benson:  Before we talk about that, you alsohad this, if  I remem ber correctly
,  
t h i s  ve r y 
ironic situation where you were accusedof  being Pols posing as Jews in ord
er to get out. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
Ye s .  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e did.  Because wewere in a group of Jews. W e hadnopapers 
whatsoever.  Of  course, there were people who said
 
--
 
who thought we were
 
--
 
the Polish 
people wanted to get out. And the only people they were letting out, semi, sem i
-
of f ic ia lly,  we re  
the Jews.  T hey had som e agreem ent.  So they said, oh, no, you'rePolish trying to pretend to 
be Jewish. I know m y m other said
,  ﬁM
y husband's nam e is Izak.
ﬂ
  
And som ebody sided 
because they knew the fam ily.  
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  At what pointdid your momfeel it was saf e todropthefalse identity as 
Catholics andbe yourselves? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, when we were wi th the group we did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat point she said it'sok. Did it have any impacton your sister? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,m y sister didn't know she was Jewish.  W henm y cousin cam e f rom

Palestine, she looked at him . And as I said, the Polish people are very good at recognizing 
Jewish people.  She lookedathim and she said, 
ﬁ
Ar
i, you're aniceguy but you're Jewish.
ﬂ   
 
[Laughter]
 
 
So he said, " Yes,but so are you."
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
And she said," No,I am  not; absolutely not."  Yes.  Unf ortunately that was the 
situation.  Buteventually we m anaged to gether out. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onceyou were able to reunite with your f ather
 
--
 
ofcourse, you toldus a little 
bit about thef act that he survi ved Siberia when the Soviets andGerm ans went to war. T hey 

were released.  He could joinAnders' Arm y under the Britishf lag. W hat was it likef or you to 
reunite with yourf ather?  Here you've really been in thisextraordinary world with your m om  
where she's protected you and saved you.  You were her companion, little sister. W hat was 
that likef or you? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  It was com plicated.
  
I had to learna new language, anew culture. Itwas 
ver y com plicatedf orme.  I knew how to readand write.  And suddenly I looked andI couldn't 
read. English didn'tfitintom y knowledge.  My m other said I couldn't go to a Polish school 
because she said there wasn't one.  I was anxious to go toPolish schoolbecause I knew so 
m uch more than the other kids. But m y mother said, 
ﬁN
o , 
no, no, you're now living in England.  
You have to gotoan English school.

So she insistedonm y going to an English

get on with it.  You know?

f rustrated. I take up table tennisbecause tennis was notavailable.  
T able tennis was very good because I couldhit that ball.  I started in college.

anything like that, you can't think of your hand.  You just look atthat ball.  So that was a v

As I said, it hada lot of good things.  Ihad com pany. W hen wem oved to London,I

I worked during the day.  I played table tennis inthe

And that gave m ea wonderfultrip eventually to Israel. Back then Israel was created 
andthey had the Maccabiah 
G
am es.  And the Maccabiah Games were like the Jewish 
O
lym pics where you had people, Jewish youth, com ingf rom  all over the world every f our 
years.  And in 1953I had thehonor to represent England in the Maccabiah Games.  Yes.  It 
was the most wonderful trip f orm e.  Ithink itgave m e m y soulback, I always say
, t
o be there
 
a
ndto seea Jewish country
.  A
f terbeing thrown out of everywhere i t
 
ga ve  m e  af ee l i n g of 
belonging.  
 
 
Even though
,  
I went back 
to Englandbecause I knew that m y mother needed us.  She 
was ver y ill.  She was not well.  She had ruined her health.  She was ver y worried about my 
sister.  Recoveredeventually.
  
SoI went back
.  
 
 
In 1957, the next Maccabiah cam earound
;  
Iwent back again to Israel.  AndI stayed 
in Israelfor quite a few years, workin g at theAm erican Em bassy in T elAvi v.  That's why I' m  in 
the states.  I know that a lotof people were dream ing of  com ing to the United States.  Inever 
had that dream
. 
 
Ididn't know anything aboutthe UnitedStates. But having worked there, I got 
m arried thereand Ihad a sonalready.  My husband andI applied very quietly f or the last 

quotas to com e justfor a year tothe United States. And that was in 1968.  AndI have been 
here ever since.  Ithink enough traveling. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Halina, as you said, your mother wasn't well.  How were her rem aining years? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Very, very hard.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Very hard. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Very hard.  Because they were looking for thecancer but they never

found it.  T hey had the x
-
ray.  T hey didn't have what they have today.  I think she couldhave 
probably li ved longer, but shepassed away 1956.  
 
 
T hat's why 1957 I stayed inIsrael. I broughtm y sister over as well.  Som y sister went 
back to England where she still lives.  As I said, I traveled tothe United States. W hen I retired, 
I decidedI needed to volunteer. And m y best
 
--
 
I found thef it was here, the Holoca
u s t 
Museum .  
 
 
So I've beenhere well over 10 years.  Eventually they had me tell my story, which I 
never did bef ore.  Ido it because Ifeel it's very, ver y im portant. I know the remarks I hearfrom  

people, especially f rom young kids
,  
that whenthey hear
 
a story toldby an eyewitness that it 
m akes itm uch more real.  Books are one thing, but when somebody says the real experience 

of  oneperson, itm akes it m ore realfor them. 
 
 
T hat's why I'm  ver y gra tef ul to them useum for gi ving m e this opportunity.  I'm  always 
wi lling to talk. W e have a Speaker's Bureauhere. Schools com e over.  We have groupsfrom  

all over.  T ravel if  necessary.  T hat's m y goal in life now.  It's very nice tobe of useat this point 
in  m y lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Halina, we're going to
 
have tim efor our audience to ask you a couple of 
questions,but I want to ask youone more.
  
You've beenback to your form er town of  
Zaleszc yki, f irst with Richard, your husband, and then more recently with other survi vors, I 

believe,f rom Zaleszcyki.  You saidthose trips were really rem arkable. T ell usa littlebit about 
those.
 
>> Halina Peabody: They were ver y rem arkable.  First tim e wef ound out that our house was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

29
 
destroyed. There wasnothing left. That wasonething.  Didn't spend very m uch time 
a t tha t 
tim e. But the second trip was with som epeoplef rom m y hometown.  I was too young to 
rem em ber anybody, but Ifound somebody through hereand they rem em beredme.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fromyour sam etown?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Yes
,  
f rom  Zaleszcyki.  And there were other people.  So we collected 
m oney and we went back there to place amonum ent on thatunm arked grave.  T here was 

absolutely nothing on it.  W e knew there were so many people laying there.  Names we didn't 
know.  Af ew they knew
,  
b u t I ju st reme
mber
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  From that incident you describedtous earlier.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. T hat they killed so many people there. 
 
 
Andm y second trip, last May, was m uchm ore meaningful alsobecause that was 
about m y 
m other.  I had been lookingf
or
ever for
 
her
. I knew she was the cham pion. Of  
course, we had nothing.  She couldn't keepanything.  Shehad abeautif ul gold statuette of a 

swim m er and thef our
-
leaf  clover that she used to show m e. T hat was, of course, gone. 
 
 
I didn't know who to ask.  I asked around.  I contacted the sports people there in 
Krakow andW arsaw. Nobody knew.  It was toofar back.  But som ehow, f inally, it cam e to 
light.  I was able to go andtake m y sister with m e. W eattended anexhibit of  Jewish sports 
people f rom  K
rakow.  It was an exhibit which is now traveling around where she's recognized 
and remembered. T hat was really som ethingthatm eant a lot to me.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Halina showed me a great big picture there of herm other as the Polish 
swim m ing champion
.  S
o  
recognition after all of  these years of whatshe andm any other

Jewish athletes accomplished.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  Some of them  went to the Olym pics
, h
ad Olym pic medals.
 
>> Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have tim ef ora coupleof questionsf rom our audi
ence.  W e have 
m icrophones.  So we'd like you 
to  
use them icrophone if  you can. T hat helps us hear the 
question up here. I
f  
need be, I'll repeat the questionstobe sure thatHalina hears it. T ry to 
m ake them asbrief  asyou can. Then Halinawi ll respond to the question.
 
 
W ecan geta coupleof questions, I think. W e have one right here inthemiddle.  Here 
com es them icrophone com ing down to you.
 
>> T hank you som uch for sharing with us.  Youm entioneda couple of  tim es that yourf am ily 
bef ore the war
 
andnow were not observantof  thefaith. I wondered, because you've m et so 
m any other survivors, what theaverage eff ect was on their religious belief sbef ore the war, the 

eff ects on them , and how they f eltaf terwards  about theirf aith.  Did it affect th
eir f aith? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Maybe make itpersonal to you. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, no, I have to say thatIm ust speakf ormyself  rather thanfor the 

others. Som e peoplehaddef inite concerns,you know.  My m otherexplained it tom e when I 
wa s  ve r y yo
ung so that
 
--
 
she saw that I was very m uch taken intothe church.  I wentto 
church. I went to the comm union. And she was really concerned about whether I was being 

s ligh t l y
 
--
 
becom ing Catholic maybe later on. 
 
And what she said tom e was, "W
e all pray
 
to the 
sam e God, but we do it throughdiff erent religions and you should stay with theone you were 

born in."  So I never had any problem s with religion.  And we continued notbe
in g
 
observant.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

W e didn't have m uch reason to.
 
 
My m other cam ef rom a very l iberal fam ily.  M y grandf ather used to take hishat off in 
f ront of church when he walked by becausehe saidevery reli gion shouldbe respected. He 
brought hisfam ily into Krakow, senthis children, including m y mother to Polish schools, which, 
again, was ver y helpf ul because she spoke such beautiful Polish.  And she didn't have the 
Jewish accent. This all helped during the war. 
 
 
So we didn't have any conflict. To thisday I have no conf licts. All our children are 
intermarried. T hat's because we don't live in a Jewish country.  If Ihad lived in Israel
,  
I would 
have been m arried to a Jewish m an.  But here not 
ne ce ssa rily so .
  
I know som e people had 
conf lict,butI did not. Luckily that one conf lict I didn't have. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do we have another question?  Right back here.
 
>> Very touching story.  I really appreciate you sharing this. 
 
 
As you were telling yo ur story, you m entioned about a lot of peoplehelping.  I'm just 
curious. People, they didn'thave tobut they tooka lotof  risk and they con
tinue
d  
to help you.  
You didm entionthem as they were m iracles.  Right?  Soeven aspeople
 
--
 
why would they do 
it? W hy would they risk their own lives and support som eone like you? First part. And you 

m entioned the churchfalsifying your religion,probably a big deal at that point of tim e. W hat 
were the Germ ans doing?  People would com eto know that,hey, there's somebody doing this.  
It's illegal. W ould they not know about thisand crack on all of these?
 
>> Bill Benson: T wo parts.  One is those that tookthe risk, those who helped youalong the 
wa y, why would they do that with such risk?And what wouldhappen tothem if the Germ ans 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

32
 
had known?  If I'm  capturing that correctly.
 
>> Halina Peabody: The f irst part was why w ould they do it.  First of all, they didn't know we 
were Jewish.  Nobody knew we were Jewish.  I have af eeling m aybe they suspected. Butif  
they had asked, I m ight have said yes, they might have, you know, been in danger.  But they 
couldn't check us.T hey didn't know we were Jewish
. 
 
Yes, thefam ilies, if  they were caught helping a Jew, they were in gr eat danger. And 
som e lost their lives.  That's true. And I don'tblame thosepeople. W hat Iblame is thepeople 

who didn't have tobecause it was in their interest.  Like the people
 
af ter the war who cam e out 
of  hiding. W hy didthey kill those? T hey didn't doanything wrong to anybody. T hey managed 

to survive a war in terrible conditions.  And yet the Polsthought it was the right thing to kill 
them  because they we re Jews.  So, yes. T here are two sidesto thestory. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe're probably at aplace where we will end our program . I'm going to 
turn it back to Halinaf or
 
--
 
it's our tradition that our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
getsthe last word.  So I'm 
going to gi ve it back 
to Halina to do that.
 
 
Bef ore Halinadoes that, a couple of rem inders. W e have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
p r o gr am s  
ever yW ednesday andT hursday until them iddle of August.  So we would love you to come 

backfor that if  you could possibly do that.  And you can get inf orm ation about the upcom ing 
program s andones that we've had in thepast onthe Museum 's website. Soplease do that.
 
 
I'm  also going to ask you, when Halinaf inishes, if  you don'tm ind, you'll stand. The 
reason isour photographer, Joel, is going toget a great photograph of  Halina with her back to 
you, with you in the background. And they actually turn out beautif ully.  So if you don'tm ind 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

33
 
doing that, we would love you 
to  
stand when Halina is f inished.
 
 
So on thatnote, Halina? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: Thank
 
you. W ell, I justwanted to say thank youf or com ing. I'm  gladto 
be able to tell m y story.  Hopef ully it wi ll gi ve you som e idea what happened, at least to my 
fam ily.  I'm sorry that sofew of  us survi ved, but asI said, the onesthat can im part the story in 
thehope that you canall rem em ber what happened when things went into the wrong hands, 
when evil people werein charge.  Hopefully this wi ll be preventedf orour children and 
grandchildren.
 
 
T hank you som uchfor listening.

bashful.
