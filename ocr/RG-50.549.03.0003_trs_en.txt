Beginn ing Tape One, Side A 
 
[music] 
Question: Can do it a little louder, maybe? 
Answer: 
[inaudible] 
because it gets louder later.  
Q: But if you want, you can tell me a little 
bit about what -- why -- 
why do you like this 
one, or what is it, actually? 

A: This is a 
Chopin
 concerto, and I grew up in 
Poland
, and 
Chopin
, of course, was of 
Polish origin  and I grew  up on his mu sic. 
I -- my  background was -- my  parents loved 
music and they cultivated
 music in the house, and most of
 it was classical music, with a 
sprinkling of some new mu sic, not to the ex
tent that today™s mu sic, but for instance, 
Gershwin 
was -- ﬁ
Rhapso dy  in Blueﬂ 
came out in 1938 or ™39, 
and -- just prior to the 
war, and we loved it. It was diff -- but -- it 
was different. That was the first time that I 
listened to 
Gershwin.
 And -- but 
Chopin  
was just part of my  upbringing. 
Tcha iko v sky , 
Cacciatore, 
and 
Rachmaninoff, 
very romantic.  
Q: Okay, good. That was -- that
 was nice, very romantic, th at was nice. Good. Okay , let 
me see. Let™s not make it extremely formal, 
let™s just go right to the difficult subject 

matter. Tell me -- us a little bit more about the 
time either just prior 
to liberation, or the 
mo ment of liberation. What -- what happene
d, what -- what -- wh -- who were you, 
where were you, what kind of state 
were you in, what -- what was that? 
A: Well, prior to the liberation 
we were in barrack. We were --

Q: I™m sorry, yeah, could we -- coul
d we do that again? There was the 
[indecipherable].
 
I have to find a way of holding the microphone. 
A: All right. 

Q: So at 
[indecipherable]
 prior -- prior --  
A: Prior? 

Q: Let™s see, it™s the 
little -- let me see. 
A: Prior? 
Q: Yeah, that™s better. 
A: Prior to the liberation, we
 were locked in a barracks a
nd the windows were shut and 
they were supposed -- supposed ly trying to  ki
ll us, but there was not enough time, they 
had to escape because the Ru
ssian forces closed. And th
e sight through the locked 
shutters, we could see that the towers were empty, and th e 
SS
 was gone. And th is was the 
moment that we realized that they 
abandoned us. And that was April the 26
th
, I believe, of 
1945. Since I was badly hurt, my friends were
 holding me, and broke the doors and ran to  
the kitchen, brought some margarine. We st
uffed ourselves with th
e margarine, and we 
decided to leave the camp. Went across th
e street, there was the house that the 
commandant used to live, with
 the garden. There were seve
ral of us, one girl had her 
mo ther with, and somebody brought two eggs 
and two potatoes, and at that moment the 
commandant came back with a gun. And we 
were frozen stiff looking at him. And the 
poignant part was that he was afraid of us. An
d he disappeared. And 
we decided to leave.

My friends were helping me. We went thro
ugh the fields, there was a great deal of 
firework -- not firework, fire stemming from 
the war. They were being bomb arded, and 
we ran. We joined with two 
Po lish men who work ed th ere in the fields. We reached the 
front line and first -- we saw the first Russian
, and this was the -- suppose our liberation -
- supposed liberation. Pretty soon we discove
red that this was not the freedom that we 
were dreaming of. Freedom was very different
. We thought of the normal -- normal life 
that will come of finding the family. 
It was very difficult period of time. 
Q: Could you -- could yo
u say a little bit more about sort of
 the first impressions of the -- 
the liberators that you had? What
 was the condition at the -- at
 the fe -- you -- you went to 
the actual front line? 
A: Yes. It was actual front line because the 
war was still going on and the sh ooting was 
on both sides. As a matter of 
fact, one of the girls was hit.
 We just didn™t have time to 
look, we were running like an an
imal. The first Russian was of 
Asiatic 
origin because his 
face, the features were 
Asiatic
. And he was very dirty, I re
me mb er his big, black leather 
boots, filthy uniform. He was the liberator, a
nd we thought we should
 kiss his boots. He 
told us -- he motioned to us to  go back, and th e Ru ssians gave
 us help. The help consisted 
of a barrel of herring. And we ate the herring
, and of course the -- w e be-became very 
thirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broke
n. And th ey told  us to leave, my friends 
held me. We reached the first house in the village, the roof was gone from the 

bombard ments. We went to the basement, the 
basement was very well prepared with fo od

and sleeping equipment. We lay down -- we at
e, we lay down , and th e very same night, 
two Ru ssians came, and raped tw o girls. So -- 
Q: I want -- I want to ask you --  

A: Yes? 
Q: -- something else before we -- we go on
. Did you get any medi
cal attention? Say a 
little bit more about th-the shape that you we
re in. You said you we
re badly hurt, but -- 
A: I was -- 

Q: -- did you get medical attention, anything? 
A: Well, you have to understand the circum
st ances, the Russians were fighting, it was 
just unbelievable. I didn™t see anything th ere of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even 

[indecipherable]
 Red -- Red Cross. But they had so
me bandages and they gave me the 
bandages and I was bandaged around my  body 
to hold my ribs. Th
at™s all I remember. 
And wh en -- once we went to the basement, 
i t was some sort of 
a tra p door going down, 
which I wasn™t familiar with before. We we
nt to the basement and one of the Ru ssians 
was drunk. Wi -- he started to shoot at the ja
rs which were lined on
 the shelves, and th e 
pieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in 
my left leg, and I was lying down on one of 
the two cots, and I ask one of the Polish men,
 please protect me. I -- when the times will 
be normal, I will give you -- 
my -- my mother, my family 
will give you anything in the 
world if you will help me. He covered me, a
nd he sat down on me. And I was lying there 

and my  leg was bleeding, but I didn™t make a 
sound. That was the night that two girls --

one was taken out, one was -- they blew the 
candle out and they raped her, and the other 
one came bloody back. This was my  liberation. Ve
ry bitter. We wondered if this is -- i-if 
this was worth it, to survive to
 see this. The next day we le
ft for the village, to another 
house. 
Q: You -- you stayed -- you stayed in
 that village for a little while -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and you met other people there, and th
ere were other episodes, but y -- it was -- it 
was still a dangerous, difficult si
tuation. But did you experien
ce any sense of -- of -- you 
had a little bit to eat, you had tw
o Polish protectors, if you w
ill. Did you experience any 
sense of -- of -- of freedom yet? 
A: No. The freedom was very bleak. I was 
petrified of the Ru ssians now. So, after a 
couple of days, next house to ours was occupi
ed by the former Fren
ch prisoners of war. 
And I talked the them and they
 decided that they will take 
me to their house and protect 
me, and I stayed with 
them for quite awhile. 
Q: Now, after awhile then, 
things changed, people starte
d moving back to their native 
countries. Did you go to -- well is -- let me not
 ask as -- as such a question, what -- what 
h a pp en ed  after 
awhile then? 
A: Well naturally, I thought th
at my family survived. I wa
s unaware that everybody was 
killed. So I wanted -- my firs
t thought was going back  to 
Poland
. And there were some 
Polish people with some sort of equi
pment that they were going towards 
Poland
 and they

had carts, and th ey took me -- they had Po lish flag, and we went thro ugh 
Lignitz,  
I 
remember, and then -- the names escape
 me, b u t I know that we were in 
Lignitz, 
and we 
were in another city big, and that city 
was already organized, 
and people already had 
ration cards, and we slept in a place that we we
re assigned to. But I still wanted to go to 
my native city, and there was -- th ere was a trai
n already, on one of th
e tracks, and I went 
with this train to 
Warsaw
. And in  
Wa rsa w
 I got off the train, of course everything was 
without money and no possessions. A human bein
g is very strong, unbelievably strong. 
And in 
Warsa w
, I was just standing th ere with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- truck, 
and I ask him where he is going and he said he is going to  
Ló dz, 
which was my city. And 
I ask him if he will take me, and he 
agreed. And that™s how I reached it. 
Warsaw
 was 
completely destroyed. There was -- I -- I ha
d uncle and aunt, but I couldn™t find the 
streets. Everything was in ru
ins. So I was very glad that
 I was getting the ride, without 
money, which I didn™t have. 
He went -- we stopped in 
Lublin
, I believe and he went out 
to eat and he left me in  the car. And he came
 back, I think he brought a piece of bread, 
but I™m not too sure. I was hungry. We reached 
Ló dz
 and -- of course, 
Lódz 
was not 
destroyed because it was occupied very quickly.
 And I tried to go to the place that we 
lived. I was not let in. The Polis
h people occupied  our place. 
Q: Could you -- could 
you be a little mo re specific about
 that? You lived in a certain 
street -- 
A: Yes.

Q: -- and the house was still there? 
A: All the houses on our street were ab
solutely in perfect
 condition, because 
Lódz
 was 
occupied by the Germans, I be
lieve on September sixth, maybe
 fifth of 1939. So the city 
had only the first day of bomb ing and it was 
not destroyed. And ou
r house was standing, 
and the so-called superintende
nt was still the same one. And 
when he saw me, he thought 
that he -- that he saw a ghost. He said in
 Polish, how come I survived, why did I come 
back. This was the greeting I have -- received. 
When I wanted to go upstairs to our place, 
our apartment, the 
Lódz
 place, the people wouldn™t let me
 in. And I went down and the 
super said that the Germans own -- took ev
erything out. The carpets, and wh atever there 
was there, they took it out. So I went to -- tw
o streets further. There was a -- so me sort of 
a bureau that had information, people who 
came were putting down  their names. And I 
looked through their list -- 
Q: Was it 
HIAS
? 
A: I am not too sure if this was 
HIAS
. Something to do with
 displaced person 
organization, but I -- I don™t rememb er. And I 
don™t want to say something that I™m not 

absolutely sure. And 
I looked for the names, there we
re no familiar n ames with the 
exception of one, which was my girlfrie
nd. And my  girlfriend surv ived in 
Lódz 
in hiding 
with -- with her husband. Her address was there,
 and I went to her. And I stayed with her 
for couple of weeks,
 and I decided since 
Poland
 didn™t want me, I don™t want 
Poland
. 
And I decided to go back west.

Q: Could you s -- so nobody from your entire fa
mily survived , at leas
t at that time you -- 
that™s what you knew. 
A: At that time I -- I didn™
t think anybody
 survived. 
Q: Say a little bit more about your decision to -- your feelings about 
Poland
 and about 
wanting to leave 
it. A little bit. 
A: My feeling about 
Poland
 was very bitter. The Germans 
started the war, the Germans 
were the enemy. However, Poles were my  country men. I grew up there, I loved the 
language. I loved the literature
. I was, you may say patriotic
. I had Polish girlfriends, and 
I thought on coming b
ack that I will meet so me people. I -- I was bitterly disappointed. 
That stems already from before, 
because when the war started,
 my friends didn™t come to 
see me . They could have in the beginning, be
fore we went to the ghetto. But not having 
family left, and not wanting to
 contact any of my Polish ex
-friends, my -- my idea was to 
leave 
Poland
 forever and ev er. I didn™t want to have anything to  do with 
Poland. 
Q: So you made your wa
y, with a friend, to 
Berlin. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you remember how long
 -- oh, do you reme mb er, by th
e way, how long, roughly, 
it took you to get from the place 
you were liberated -- that was 
Ravensbrück
, was it? 
A: I-I was liberated in 
Bittenberg
. 

Q: In 
Bittenberg
, of course, I™m sorry. 
A: I was in 
Ravensbrück
 prior to it.

Q: Yes, yes, i-in 
Bittenberg. 
How long did it take 
you on foot, on horse cart to get to 
Lódz, 
that™s such a -- 
A: Well, no, we -- we went to 
Lignitz
 first from
 Bittenberg,
 that was not that far. From 
Lignitz
 we had a train to 
Warsaw
. From 
Warsaw
 I was in that truck to 
Ló dz. 
I cannot 
tell you exactly the frame of time that this
 occurred, but after two weeks being in 
Lódz
, 
and my  friend was with her husband, and I 
-- I just didn™t feel welcome. My po -- my 
Poland 
was not my  
Poland
 any more. I wrote -- I wrote a poem about it here in the 
States, 
that the fatherland di
dn™t love me. So I 
flaunted. 
I don™t want them any mo re. 
And I decided to move to 
Berlin
 because I was told that 
they had displaced person 
camps, run by the allied forces, and I thou
ght maybe somebody 
survived there. 
Q: So you made your way to 
Berlin -- 
you don™t have to go into  -- into the story, 
although it is an interesting 
one, but for this purpose -- and sen -- so you arrived in 
Berlin
, what was it like? What was 
Berlin 
like? What did you see when you arrived? 
What happened? 
A: It was very strange. We came -- we came w
ith -- previously I told 
this story, that the 
Russian smuggled us to his cr -- tr
ain comp artment, and we arrived in 
Berlin
 and he let 
us off at the station, and we were standing 
there, and sort of sizing people. And we saw 
two people, two young men who didn™t look -- a
ppear to be Jewish, and we approached 
them and we asked them, and they said 
yes. And th ey gave us some fare in 
fennix, 
I 
don™t rememb er how mu ch. And they put us on 
bus and they told  us 
to get off ha -- was

this 
Rickenstrasser,
 I don™t remember the first camp before 
Schlactensee. 
This was the 
very first one, it was in the Russian sector. 
Q: You mentioned in the last interview, you said 
Oranienstrasse. 
A: 
Oranien -- oran -- 
I don™t rememb er the name. I don™t remember. But this was the 
very first camp, displaced person camp. And I 
was grateful for the help, but I didn™t want 
this type of -- I wanted privacy.  

Q: But what -- what did -- what -- what di
d it look like, what -- what happened there? 
What -- what -- 

A: We were given places to sleep , we were 
given food, and I don™t remember too much 
about it, maybe because I™m ge
tting older, mi -- things are so
rt of slowly blending and 
disappearing. I™m trying to remember th
e good things, and I™m trying to, maybe 
subconsciously forg et the sad things. Maybe th
is helped me to live. The camp provide us 

with vital things that we ne
eded to live. 
The two of us, my  girlfriend and I, didn™t feel 
comfortable. We wanted some sort of a more
 normal life, so we were given a room by a 
German war widow. I still remember her name, 
Frau Beans
. And she 
[indecipherable]
 
and we were give a room, it was -- it was co
ld, I remember. We had a little stove in the 
middle of the floor th at we made of coal or
 anthracite, to warm up. And we were given 
ration cards, and some Russians started to come
 to visit this aunt, and th is -- and -- and 
the woman and her aunt, becau
se they -- they  -- they were given some food from the 
Russians. What did they do, I have no idea. We
 were very unhappy about that situation.

Q: Why? 
A: It wasn™t normal. 

Q: What was normal? What -- what did you wa
nt? Wh at is it that you wanted , that you 
mo st needed? You were given th e 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I wanted warmth, I wanted --  

Q: Could you -- could 
you say that again? 
A: -- I wanted warmth. I wanted the -- the pe
rsonal life, not to be in somebody™s room 
and behave and -- an
d make that piece of bread on this little stove, heat it up, and go for 
the ration with the card and stand on a line. I didn
™t -- I didn™t expect 
my freedom to be of 
that sort. I -- I wanted to di
sassociate myself with 
all this. It was very bitter. To top this 
all, I saw in this German house, a 
Menorah
, which her husband, who was killed in the 
war, sent her from one of the occupied countr
ies. The woman had no idea what it was, 
but I saw a silver 
Menorah
, and this broke my heart. Afte
r that, we had a little incident, 
we went to a movie house, whic
h I described before. I did not 
want to stay in the Russian 
sector at all. My friend was a little bit ente
rprising, she got herself a boyfriend. I was 
petrified of everybody and ev erything. I just 
wanted to  run aw ay to
 American sector. And 
I went to the -- I think this was the Jewish 
HIAS
, some Jewish committee in 
Cheplin
, 
and I told  him that I wanted to move, and he 
says I have to be registered. So I got from 
the -- from that organization some coffee 
Bonne
 café, and the Germans were crazy about 
Bonne
 café, so I took th is 
Bonne
 café and I went to the German
 police station -- I really -

12
- I -- I™m w o ndering now how -- 
how I could have done this, 
because I wasn™t well. And I 
asked the policeman if he would -- because 
everything, it was very organized already, 
you had to be registered, and liv
e in this place, or this place. And I wanted desp erately to 
leave the Russian sector and 
be in the American sector. 
Q: Why specifically the American sector? 

A: Not specifically American, co uld have b
een English, or -- but I had some sort of 
relatives in 
America
, so I felt that this would be maybe 
the closest. And that™s what I was 
advised also by that 
Joint
, or 
HIAS
. And I gave him the 
Bonne 
café, the German 
policeman took it, and put my  name
 on list, and I got the room by 
Frau Pegiloft, 
town of 
Strasse
 
[indecipherable]
. And 
Frau Pegiloft
 was a very old lady who at night locked 
her room because she was afraid of me. But 
after couple of weeks she warmed up to me, 
and I said, 
Frau Pegiloft --
 because I could speak German, 
Frau Pegiloft, 
how was this 
the -- she said, ﬁAh, 
kvotch
. I am the only Nazi left,ﬂ sh e said. ﬁI w as a Nazi, they all 
were Nazis.  But now nobody says he was a Na
zi and I™m the only one. I™m old, I don™t 
care any more.ﬂ So I stayed with 
Frau Pegiloft
 until the -- I received 
avo ndero ng
 papers 
-- that means the paper to go to -- I think it was 
Bremenhaven. 
Q: Did you not stay a little while in

in 
Schlactensee
, and -- and -- 
A: Oh, ex cuse me.

A: Excuse me. Yes, I was -- before 
Frau Pegiloft, 
I was in 
Schlactensee,
 you™re right. 
The policeman registered me in amer -- 
amer -- American sector and I went to 
Schlactensee. 
And I was in 
Schlactensee
 very short time, that™s why I don™t remember. I 
did -- I was not happy in 
Schlactensee
. It -- 
Q: What -- what was it? What was 
Schlactensee 
[

A: 
Schlactensee
 was again, they give you the basics. 
Q: No, I mean, you -- you should -- you 
should say that it was di -- display -- 
A: It was a -- 
Schlactensee
 was a displaced person camp . An
d they had a lot of people 
already and people were very enterprising, 
they were used to th
e conditions, they  had 
friends, they were going to 
Poland
, they were bringing goods back and forth to 
Breslau
, 
and 
Brotswaf
. I could not partake in any of this, and all to me was very strange. I 
couldn™t eat the way people were
 buying something, sitting at
 a table and talking about 
business. I was lost. I didn™t fe
el good, I wanted to be in an
 -- in a room of my own, I 
wanted privacy. And that™s why I left 
Schlactensee
. I w ent back to that
 police, and at that 
time I was getting, ever
y month, some sort of ration fro
m the Jewish committee. Coffee, 
some cigarettes, somet imes they
 had, sometimes they didn™t ha
ve it. But whatever I had, I 
swapped with this policeman, and I got the room by 
Frau Pegiloft
. That™s how

Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: And then eventually though
, you did think about emigrati
on. Say a little bit about that, 
how -- what -- what your thoughts were a
nd where you decided you would have to go. 
A: Well, at this time 
Israel
 was not an 
Israel
 yet, it was 
Palestine. 
I was -- my health 
was precarious to say the least. I was slowly 
healing. I did not feel that I -- I was not 
really brought up as a Zionist. I had the deep 
feeling, I still do, but I didn™t think that I 
would fit in that surrounding. I was unable 
to work . People had to
 work physically 
starting 
Isr ael
, to build the country. 
My thoughts were about 
United Sta tes
 because I 
knew that I had some sort of relatives here. A
nd th at fact was brough
t to my attention by 
the chaplain, and one sergeant 
in the American army
, in that Jewish 
committee. And they 
asked me for the name, and I said the name is 
Posa lski
, and after a few months I received 
a letter from 
Detroit
 and the name was changed from 
Posa lski 
to 
Soles, 
and they located 
them. And this was my grand 
-- maternal grandmother™s sister, and there was a half-
brother in 
New Jersey
. And th at family sponsored me to come to the 
United States
. 
Q: What -- what do you -- when  
did you leave -- so you left from 
B remenhaven
, I guess, 
when  did you leave, and what do yo
u remember about the boat trip? 
A: The boat trip was a nightmare. I wanted
 to die right on that boat. Strange. I was 
liberated, I was free, I was co
ming to the best country  in the world. We were on 
Ma rin e  
Marlin
, this was an troop transporter. We were
 put down -- the people -- the displaced 
person people were -- having vi
sas, they were sponsored, were put at the bottom of the

15
boat. The top of the boat, the better deck, wa
s reserved for German war brides. So there 
was another injustice done to us. We encount
ered very, very powerful storms, and our 
boat lost part of the bow. It was unbelievable,
 that trip. I don™t kno
w what harm came to 
the boat, but I know that even the crew was 
sick. I was getting -- I was getting injections 
because I couldn™t eat. I was throwing up co
nstantly, and it took us -- I don™t remember 
exactly, ma ybe 15 or 16 days on
 the boat to finally reach 
New York
. So the freedom was

so bleak and so heartbreaking,

went to a pier -- there were benches, 
long benches and there were letters above, 

alphabetically,

walking by with a photo, showin
g that picture. And wh en I l
ooked at the picture, I said, 
in Polish, ﬁT his is my  grandmother.ﬂ So he 
knew that he found th e right person. He was 
my grandmother™s half-brother™s s
on-in-law. He was an attorney in 
New Jersey
. The 
people from 
Detroit
 couldn™t come to pick me up, because that day that our ship finally 
docked, my grandmother™s sister died, on th e very same day. And they had funeral to 
attend to. So they wired 
or called the people in 
New Jersey
, and they -- that half-brother 
of my  grandmother, and th is son-in-law came 
to pick me up. And we could not talk to 
each other. My -- my cousin, so-called cousin, 
was a very bright, educated man, but he 
spoke only English. I said
 German? No. Polish? No. Fr ench? No. Okay. Come. And I 
followed him, and there I saw this gentleman, 
gray haired  with pink cheeks and the bluest 
eyes. And I saw my  grandmother™s face, and 
that was my grandmother™s brother, and he 
spoke still some Polish and Germ
an. And I went with them. I 
remember the ride in the 
car, alongside the west side highway, and I saw 
all these lights at night, snake lights, like. 
And the 
Hudson
 River, and we came to the br
idge, huge bridge, wh ich was
 George 
Washin gton 
bridge. We crossed the bridge. I was 
sitting with my uncle -- great-uncle, 
and we reached his place in 
Patterson, New Jersey
, it was 
Patterson
. And his wife also 
spoke Polish and German and was the most 
wonderful, wonderful 
lady, who made me 
feel good, warm. She hugged me, she kissed me
, and that™s what I needed. That™s what I 

needed , I didn™t need any material things, I just
 wanted to be loved, to -- to belong. And 
that was the beginning.

Q: But then eventually, you also vi
sited the other relatives in -- in 
Detroit
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Could you say a little bit about 
that experience, what happened ? 
A: Yes, yes. Well, since I was sponsored by the people in 
Detroit
, and the funeral 
postp oned my  going th ere, they co mmunicated w
ith this family that I should stay there 
for two weeks and come to 
Detroit
. They send a ticket for a train, and I was put in a train 
in a very nice car. I remember th at I had to 
-- a very nice chair facing the window, so it 
must have been first class, I 
guess. And they to ld the black a
ttendant, a very nice man, to 
take care of me with food and so  forth, beca
use I couldn™t speak English. And he really 
took care of me. It was a long trip. And I was 
dressed very decently, because befo re I left 
Germany, 
all my accu mulated coffee that I still had,
 I exchanged for a nice coat. It was 
with fur, I remember. And a scarf. And I looked
 decent, fairly decent. And when I arrived 
in 
Detroit
, the people at the statio n were might
y surp rised. I don™t know wh at they 
expected, but they
 thought that this w
ill come somebody from beyo
nd the moon. Well, I -
- sure, I didn™t speak English, 
but I had brains. And I looked 
all right, because I -- I had 
the rations already in 
Germany
 to eat, and I had that coupl
e of weeks with my  aunt -- 
great-aunt and uncle. They  fed 
me and they -- they were ve
ry, very nice to me. And I 
spent some time with the people in 
Detroit. 
The parents were nice, but their daughter was 
-- I must say she was cruel to me, because I 
took away the limeli
ght away from her. And 
I again was unhappy. So it was decided that I 
will move to another br
other they had. The

brother was an old bach elor, who 
mu st have been at that time in his 60™s, and I was in my  
early 20™s, and they thought th
at I should marry him. So I 
-- I went to a Polish part of 
town in -- in 
Detroit
, that is Polish. And I got myself a little job working on camera 
cases, and I -- I think I was paid 18 dollars 
a week, maybe 20, I do
n™t rememb er exactly. 
And I saved the money. They didn™t like that
 I got the job, because its -- it hurt their 
pride. But I couldn™t walk ar
ound without penny in my  pocke
t and -- and if I would want 
to spend five cents I would have to ask for it. I wanted to  be independent. So  I got this 
money and I saved -- they didn
™t want money from me. So I 
saved for the trip back to 
New York. 
And -- 
Q: Did -- did -- did they ask you where you -- 
what happened  to you? Did th ey have any 
understanding of wh ere you™d come from?  

A: Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I was learni
ng English rapidly. I went at night to a night 
school, and they have classe
s for -- m- m-mo st of the people at night were people who 
work ed here for many, many years, they did not
 have time to learn  th
e language properly. 
So I learned very  quickly, and I wanted to  le
ad a normal, independent life. I didn™t want 
to be dependent on ev ery -- anybody. And I di
dn™t want to stay with
 them. And the idea 
of marrying this old man was just ho
rrific. So I wanted to leave.  
Q: Did you get any medical 
attention when you were -- 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
19
A: Yes, they took me to a doctor once, and 
th-there were several things wrong with me, 
but unfortunately they didn™t ha
ve that type of help for th e spine as they have nowadays, 
so nothing could be done. 
Q: What was -- what was wrong? 
A: I had -- some ribs were damaged, broken
, and the spine s -- it didn™t show when  I was 
clothed, in clothes, but when  I was undresse
d you could see sticking
 parts of -- and I was 
very self-conscious about it. No, I didn™t 
get the proper medical care. If I would have 
gotten -- if they would have put me in corset
 in those days -- but I guess that comp assion 
is one thing, and money is another. And 
maybe it would be costly. No, I didn™t have 
proper care. And I came back to 
New Yo rk
 and went back to th
e great-uncle and great-
aunt. I took a course, three months course 
to become a baby nurse, newborn babies. And 
then I was recommended from one 
family to another, and became great friends with all 
the families. I -- I have three babies that I t
ook care of, that they are three doctors now. A 

long time already. So  it -- it 
-- it -- it™s -- it™s interesti
ng, it™s unbelievab -- I™m talking 
about my own life, but this 
is -- se ems to me t h at it™s some sort of a strange book. 
Q: So you earn -- begin to ear
n your first and earn your own 
money, how did that feel? 
A: Oh, it was wonderful because
 when I got my first ch eck, 
I gave it to my  great-aunt, 
and I said, this -- this -- this
 is the sweetest day that I ca
n help you fo r all you have done 

for me. Now, she didn™t have to depend on 
my  money because she had three daughters, 
and all three were married well, they were 
all educated. And -- but I felt independent, I

paid. And we spent many hours sitting in the k
itchen, she was an elderly lady. Now that 
I™m elderly myself -- w e were sitting -- sh
e was sitting making her homemade noodles, 
homemade, and cutting them. And 
she said, ﬁWell, when you are old you have to sit then 
you do these things.ﬂ So the little things that 
I remember with great 
li -- forgot this word, 
but this is such wonderful feeling I have wh
en I think of her, the 
-- the compassion that 
she showed me, and the -- the wa
rmth. I -- I felt that I belong
ed. And all the people that I 
work ed fo r became my  friends. I loved them a
ll, and I hope I was loved there, too. So I 
was independent of this family in 
Detroit
. 
Q: Did you talk much about 
your experience, di -- what ha
ppened ? Did you feel that 
people wanted to know, were ready to he
ar? What was sort of the situation there? 
A: In the very beginning it was very strange
. Some people didn™t believe that this was 
possible, some people didn™t want to hear, 
and I decided for awhile I won™t be talking 
about it. I didn™t want to scare people away 
from me, because I thought, they  don™t want 
to be surrounded by sadness and a teary story.
 But as I accomplishe
d my -- my goal, and 
improved my  English, I decided that my  missi
on was to survive in or
der to tell the people 
as much as I can, wherever 
they will listen to me. Becaus
e thing -- such a thing as 
Holo caust, it was of gigantic proportions. It neve
r happened to this extent and it has to be 
told. And that™s what we promised each ot
her, my family. And I was the one that was 
left. So it will -- became my goal. 
Q: In the early years, ho -- did you feel 
that people view ed  you any certain way? 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
21
A: Yes. There were two kinds of people. Th
ere were people who felt that by the very 
virtue of being born he
re, and living here for many years,
 for some reason I was sort of 
inferior to them. I disregarded this, because I fe
lt well -- I feel that this is -- I d on™t want 
to lower myself to their level. And there 
were people who were very symp athetic and 
very loving and I was drawn to these people. So
 I had to be very careful in the beginning 
not to overstate my feelings, 
not to -- I had to be very careful. People were critical of 
certain European  ways, and I could not get us
ed to some of the American ways. We ate 
differently, we -- we -- we behave
d, very often, differently, bu
t I didn™t dare to say it. I 
kept this to myself. It™s 
very unimportant, because each 
culture has its own way of 
dealing with things. And th at™s what makes us 
different and that™s -- an intelligent person 
can or -- adapt or learn from each other, or 
disregard. It™s not important. These are -- 
these are very secondary issues
, because after all, we are all human beings. If we try, we 
can get along, if we™ll only try. And th at is one
 of the issues that I 
approach wh en I speak. 
Q: Do you think that peopl
e looked at -- at a displace
d person in a certain way? 
A: In the beginning, yes.  

Q: Cou-Could you say that in a sentence? 
Not -- I ask you the question, but co uld you 
make that into a sentence? You shou
ld maybe tell your husband not to

I want to ask you now about 
what sort of -- so you wa -- you -- you were back in 
New 
York, 
or 
New Jersey

mo re comfortable, you had some money. Wh at
 was sort of the goal, what was it that you 
wanted next? 
A: What I wanted next was to 
have a child. I wanted to have a -- as I said this -- and you 
will see this on -- hear this on th
e tape, that I wanted to show 
Hitler
 that the seed 
survived. And I wanted a child 
the worst way. It was very 
unconventional those days to 
have a child without a husband. I got married to
 a man who is a very nice man. But this 
would not have been my  choice if the times
 would have been no
rmal. We are very 
different people, intellectually. And we are both
 honest, we both are of the same religion, 
we are both very honest, we are both civica
lly minded people. And we both love mu sic -- 
different kinds of mu sic, but mu sic. But we 
are very different. I needed more stimuli, 
which I couldn™t get from my  husband. 
Q: Intellectual stimulus? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Cou -- could you say it? 
A: I needed more intellectual stimulus. I trie
d to find this in reading, I became voracious 
reader. Financially I was not in position to -- to
 do things that I would have liked to. I 
would have liked to go to a good
 university. I thought that I ha
d enough brain to do it, but 
my health was precarious. I got married a
nd I immediately, the next month, I got 
pregnant. I wanted it, and I was afraid that I 
won™t be able to because I didn™t menstruate

for about four years in camps. But I was 
fortunate enough, and I wanted a daughter, 
because I always felt that the daughter will be 
close, closer than a son. So I was lucky. 
Q: Did a doctor s -- t-tell -- say that -- men
tion it again that the doctor -- you got medical 
advice and you were basically 
advised not to have a child. 
A: The doctors told me that
 it would worsen my condition,
 it would throw me off. But I 
felt that it was worth it. The -- if you put 
this on a scale, there was no comparison, I 
wanted a child. And it was worth it, and it wo
rked out beautifully, 
because I do have a 
daughter who is very  close to me. We are very
 fortunate. We nourish each other. And sh e 
has a daughter, and she has -- this is pe
rpetuating. She has the same -- the same 
relationship with her daughter. She has a 
husband who is British, and he was very 
reserved when she -- he got ma
rried, but he sort of soften
ed by our surrounding love. He 
became a ver -- much more relaxed. He™s still 
reserved, but not to the extent that he was 
before. He calls me M o m, I™m 
very happy about it. Most of 
all, I™m happy that he™s a 
wonderful husband to my
 daughter, and wonderful 
father to his child. 
Q: When  was your daughter born , what is he
r name, and how did you feel when you™ve -- 
when you got a daugh
ter, how was that? 
A: My daughter wa
s born on March 22
nd
, 1951 and her 50
th
 birthday is coming up. And 
I™ll be there next week, and so will be my 
granddaughter, she will be flying. From the 
very beginning on, my  entire 
life centered around this child. I lived on a fourth floor 

walk-up apartment in the 
Bronx
. I had only one bedroom, and the bedroom belonged to

her. We had a

 in the living room. I tried to dress her the best I could. I 
tried to read stories, sing so ngs, teach her, expo
se her to music. I -- I delighted in bringing 

her up. It was my -- my life changed. I wa
s very grateful. And I acquired friends. We 
decided to  form groups. I belonged  to a

interests with me. 

Q: You -- did you have s-survi
vor friends, or di -- s-say a 
little bit more ab
out the kinds 
of friends you had, or
 w-was it -- s-say --  
A: No, no, no, strangely enough
, I lived in the building th at I was the only su rvivor and I 
formed friendships with my neighbors. This 
was 1950 - ™51, you have to understand that 
it -- the conditions were absolutely different, 
it was safe. When the 
baby was born, I used 
to -- it was hot, we didn™t have air conditioning.

summer. T h e humidity. So we us
ed to go downstairs, the ca

and we walked to th e park at night, nobody 
was afraid. It was a local park. And all the 
other mothers with their babies were there, 
and we™re -- we™re sittin g 
at night, not being 
afraid. So we formed very cl
ose friendships. Not one of my  
friends there was a survivor, 
strangely en ough. One was Italian, 
Connie
, adorable. And three others were Jew ish. We 
played 
Mah  Jo ng
, I remember. I learned how to play 
Mah  Jo ng
 tho-those days. And 
then in the summer, w h en
 my husband started to make a 
little bit more, in the summer we 
were leaving 
New York 
for the country . We used to rent
 a room. And th e husbands were

A: My husband wo rked  as
 a inspector first. H e -- he -- he 
had -- he went to Univ ersity of 
Roch ester
, but he did not ha
ve his actual degree in engineering, so he worked  fo r 
General Dynamics for many years. They went ba
nkrupt, that part that
 he worked for, so 
he switched to a smaller place, I believe 
Sequential. 
And then he was hired by 
Unio n 
Carb ide. 
And he wo rked in 
Union Ca rbide
 for six years, until his heart -- he had a small 
heart attack and I told him I don™t want him 
to wo rk an y mo re. I don™t need the money, I 
can live -- I saw worse things. Money was not ev
erything, so I talked him into retiring. 
Q: So he was an engin
eer of sorts, though? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And say a little bit 
more about life in 
New York
, then. You didn™t have that much 
money but you were not unhappy. 

A: No, I was not unhappy because I had friends
 who were in the same circumstances. If 

you don™t have mu ch, a
nd your friends don™t have mu ch , 
you -- you™re not unhappy. You 
have food, you have clothes, 
you -- w-we were going -- as a matter o f fact we were -- 
when we played once a 
week, we -- we used to -- but I don™t remember, 50 cents, or 75 
cents on a side. When  we had en ough money, 
all the couples went to the theater, because 
we loved theater. So we packed two cars, a
nd we went out. And wh en there was enough 
money we went to 
Lindy™s 
for cheesecake, too. And I™ve -- 
later on I found especially 
one friend that she had my interest in
 museums, and we used to go to

 And I loved that, I loved that

Q: You also went to libraries, I

 of my -- my learning process.
 I learned a -- a really -- in 
the beginning by my self, sufficien
tly to be understood, and I t
ook great care to be correct, 
to be fairly articulate. And I couldn™t get 
rid of my  accent, which the American people 
after awhile, they saw that I spoke well, they
 -- they -- they were changing. I was -- I was 
nice and -- but these were different people fro

Q: How -- what kind of aspirations did you 
have for your daughter, how did you bring 
her up? You talked a little bit about -- alrea
dy about -- about education and you want her 
to have a cu ltural background, 
she liked music, or somethin
g, but how did you think in  
terms of education, values
 that you wanted to -- 
A: Well, values -- the -- the morals and et
hics you teach the child from the beginning. 
About education, I felt that in 
-- I™m not going to push  her in one direction. I want her to 
pursu e her own road  to the -- the kind of ed uc ation that she wants. She wanted to study 
Shakespeare
. My husband used  to laugh, he sa
id, ﬁWhat do you want to do with  
Shakespeare
?ﬂ He said, ﬁHow about a little typing on
 the side?ﬂ And she said, ﬁBut I 
love it.ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell, she loves it, so she ha
s to do it, she has to be happy, to do wh at 
she likes to do.ﬂ And once she was in high school, she went for a juni
or year abroad  to 

England
. And that, of course, changed her life, 
she became an Anglophile. And she want 
-- she dreamt about going to gra
duate school for her masters in 
England
. And we sent 
her to 
England
, to Shak espearean Institu
te. And whatev er you learn, it™s your gain. It™s a 
wonderful thing. And -- 

Q: Was -- was that difficult, to let her go? 
A: It was difficult, but I had again to outweigh
 my personal feeling for her happiness. She 
chose this path, she wanted, and this was th
e best school. Once she was accepted, to me 
this was an omen, she has to go. And she we
nt and sh e loved it, and she graduated. She

has masters in English lit -- literature. As a 
matter of fact she went also one summer to 
London, 
University of 
London
. That was before she went to
 the Shakespearian Institute. 
She doesn™t do anything with th e 
Shakespeare
 now, but she work s 
twice a week in

 College, and she also has students 
who apply for colleges, she does work

[indecipherable]
. She is a superb wr-writer. 
Q: Did you talk to her about -- about your
 experience? How did you impart -- how did 
she get to know about that? How™d -- 
how was that handled in your family? 
A: She always knew that I was a survivor. Her 
father was not, her fa -- father lived here 
through -- through the war. But I was a survivor
 and I never made secret out of it. I did 
not tell her in the details, the gory details of 
what went through, but 
I wanted her to know 
because this was the legacy
. She was entitled to 
know where her moth
er came from, my 
background, I wanted her to be proud of it,
 and wh at she is. At the same token, she 
resented the people who caused 
my I -- my affliction, my bein
g disabled as a result of the 
tremendous beatings that I was getting. Sh
e could not ga -- accept it. And I tried to 
temper her dislike -- more than
 dislike, her hatred, into -- 
it was very diplomatic, into 
understanding th at people are people. There 
were people who were good. And we -- she 
went to the mu seum, she saw how many people
 saved people, at the risk of their own 
imprisonment or even  losing th
eir lives. I myself was surpri
sed to see many Polish names 
on th e wall of the mu seum. I was not aware that
 that many Po lish people help ed, I really 
wasn™t.

Q: Which mu seum? 
A: The Holocaust Museum in 
Washington, D.C.. 
I was surprised. I knew about the 
Danes at that time. My surprise was complete
 when I first pers -- o n ce only, I went to 

Israel
 to visit 
Yad Vashem
, and I saw that street of the Ri
ghteous Gentiles, and I -- I just 
broke down, because this was 
a very revealing thing to me, and being aware of the 
goodness of some people. People who did not 
lose their humanity, who -- who are giants. 
Because everybody now has to say to 
himself, how would I act under these 
circumstances? Could I have done it? Could I ha
ve hidden people at the risk of my  life? 
There was one 17 year old girl
. 17 year old girl who had 13 
Jews hidden in her house, 

and they all survived. So
 this is -- this -- this is herois
m -- heroism, that™s -- that™s -- 
that™s wonderful. So this is always what 
I point out, the -- the bad and the good.  
Q: All right, let™s go back to 
Israel
. When did you go to  
Israel
 and what was the 
experience like? What -- what
 did it mean to you? 
A: I went to 
Israel, 
don™t rememb er the -- the -- the year. It was the year after the Six 
Day War when 
Jerusalem 
was returned to 
Israel. 
Goin g to 
Israel
 was -- I was not as 
excited as I maybe should have
 been, but once I was there,
 it was th e most incredible 
feeling that occurred when I was at the Wailing Wall. And I am not a very religious 
person. I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away. She left for 
Palestine 
when 
she was a youngster, she was in
 the Zionist movement and she got married, and sh e really 
worked the soil. She was a real 
sabra
. Her children were born there, her grandchildren,

everybody was in the army. So we we
nt to visit her. Once we went to 
Jerusa lem
, and I 
went to the wall, and I stood in front of th
is -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched -- 
touched the stones, something inside me cha
nged. I cannot describe the feeling, it was 
like the history of the millennia came thr
ough my body. I reminded myself that my 
grandfather had on th e wall of his room, some 
sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh  
Jerusalem
, if -- can™t quote it. Something about
 losing a hand. I don™t -- I cannot be 
verbatim, I cannot, but I know
 that it™s very well known, a
nd I know that existed in many 
homes. So this came to  my mind. 
Jerusalem
, walking the streets, th e historical cobbled 
streets, which led from around th e 
wall, through th e 14 station of 
Jesus
 were of tremen -- 
made tremendous impact on me, b
ecause I walked on history. 
Jesus
 did walk there. 
Mary Magdalene 
was there. The Roman soldiers were there. The Hebrews were there, 
and here I am walking there. Tremendous im
pact. I went to the mo sque, to the blue 
mosque. I took my shoes o
ff, I saw the people -- very fe
w people in there. I went 
downstairs where the rock is, and th
is is allegedly the rock on which 
Abra ham
 was 
supposed  to sacrifice his son, and God stopp
ed him. I don™t know -- these were legends, 
but to me this was something that history 
repeated in all the hu
ndreds and hundred s of 
years. So I sort of became a little part of th
e history, touching the 
whole thing. It made 
tremendous impact on me. Going to 
Ya d Va shem
 was another story. Go ing in there and 
standing at the gallery, looking down at the sl
abs of stone with the names of the camps, I 
broke down. I thought I am im
mune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I

cried. When  I walked  out, it was one 
of these beautiful s-sunny days in 
Jerusa lem
, and 
you™re coming out from this dark chamber of
 reme mb rances of the tragedy th at human 
people suffered at human hands. And you go out 
and there is this street with the trees. 
The street with the trees of the Righteous Gentile s. The contrast is so startling. It is so eye 
opening. I -- I will never forget til the day I die,
 my feeling when I saw this. At that point 
I was not aware of all the Gentiles who did 
help. I knew smattering of things, because I 
was always interested readi
ng th e books. I knew about 
Denma rk
. I knew about sporadic 
things, but the names that I™ve 
seen this, and the trees. The wh
ole idea was so special to 
me that it was the highlight of my trip. 
Q: Going back to -- oh -- oh no, let™s actually
 -- you -- you -- you -- you s-said a little bit 
about you™re not very  religious. Speak a little 
-- speak a little bit about your relationship 
to Judaism, and about your faith. 
A: Well, I grew up in a fami ly that was 
-- my mo ther and father were non-observant 
Jews. However, the tradition was kept up. 
We went for all the big holid ays to 
grandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism aliv
e, and they were religious. They were not 
Orthodox, but they were relig
ious. I will never forget the 
Seders
, the warm feeling of 
being with all my fa
mi ly, and with strangers, because 
we always -- my grandparents 
invited strangers, this was a tradition, fro m orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish 

origin who did not have place to
 go to. We always had strangers at the table. And th  -- we 
were only two grandchildren there, I was the 
older one, and mo th er™s sister boy was the 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
32
younger one. And th ey had a cook, and a se
rving maid, and th ere was a long, long table 
laden with this food, and the people, and 
the happiness, and th e lights, because my  
grandfather always said let there be a lot of 
light, it™s a holiday. So all the lights in all the 
rooms were on. It was such a wonderful, happy 
feeling. New Year™s we used to go to the 
temp le to pick up my  grandparents because th
ey were going -- my parents didn™t, and we 
always brought a -- white flowers with us, a 
bouquet of white flowers, I don™t know why. 
So the memories and the -- the -- of the traditi
on were very strong with me. I -- I believe 
in some sort of supreme being, but I couldn™t
 define it. I did not ha
ve Hebrew education, 
neither did my mother. I -- I™m 
av -- extremely good Jew at h
eart because I believe in the 
commandments, and I feel if y -- you don™t have to be Jewish to follow th e 
commandments. And if you follow the comma ndm
ents, you™re religious. My father™s 
idea was more philoso 
-- philoso phical, he thought that 
God surrounds us, that God is 
everywhere, in every huma -- i-
in every human, in every livi
ng tree, in the nature. And I 
sort of adopted this. However, in camp, I wa
s questioning, where is that supreme being? 
Where is God? What™s happen
in g? These are human beings who are doing this to other 
human beings, therefore, is there a God? The 
questioning. Long time. I slowly returned to  
the faith. I™m not a temp le goer, but I feel 
that I am a good Jew because I observe the 
commandments. I will not steal, I will honor -- unf
ortunately I don™t have parents, I™m an 
old lady my self. And I tried 
to bring up my  daughter in th
e spirit, and my  daughter did 
not have 
Bat Mitzvah, 
but my  granddaughter did. So  it™
s like coming back. 
The circle is

33
repeating. And wh en I spoke at my gran ddaughter™s 
Bat Mitzvah
, I did say it, that the 
seed survived after all. To me
 this was very, very powerful 
statement. In view that so 
many members of my family were killed, a
nd I felt that I was the weakest link, and I 
survived , and I was able to produce the next pr
 -- generation. It was very strong feeling, 
and this brought me 
back to the faith.  
Q: You implicitly -- you seemed to imply just 
now th at there was what is now coined  or 
termed survivor™s guilt, a 
little bit. Is there -- 
A: Definitely. 
Q: Did you feel guilty -- 

A: Definitely. 

Q: -- could you say so
mething about that? 
A: Definitely. I lived with that
 sense of guilt all my life. I fe
lt that maybe I wasn™t the one 
deserving to survive. I -- ma
ybe I wasn™t worth it. There 
were so many people in the 
family who were much more de
serving to surv ive, and I was chosen to be the one. You 
live with this guilt always. I will never get rid 
of this guilt. And my daughter tried to get 
this out of me, but it™s down deep 
somewhere there, th
e guilt is there. 
Q: Did you feel that you have th is -- that 
you have or had a special obligation in some 
w a y ,  th en ? 

A: Definitely. To sp eak. To 
leave something behind me. I™m sorry that I did not write a 
book, but this was such a tr
end, everybody was writing book
s. I said maybe by spoken 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
34
words to people, maybe I will reach people by the 
very virtue of being in flesh in front of 
them. It was not a book, it was not a page, it 
was not a printed word, it was me, in flesh. 
And I tried to convey  this to my  listeners, 
you are looking at a survivor. I was there. You 
will be able to tell next generation, I spoke an
d listened to a surviv or. To me this was so 
important, maybe more than books. Sometimes 
I™m sorry I didn™t write, but it™s too late 
for that, so I have to be satisfied w
ith what I did. I tried my very best. 
Q: Wh-W hen did you start spea
king, and was it on your own impetus, or did somebody 
else urge you to , or -- 
A: Nobody urged me. I felt -- fi
rst of all, the family said
, when  we saw that we are 

doomed, that if someo n e survived, some -- th
at one should speak. There was no question 
about it in 
Poland
 or 
Germany, 
I would not dream about it. In the beginning in  the 
States
, my  English wasn™t good enough, and it 
was absolutely neglig ent, I didn™t speak 
the language. When I learned an
d I became fairly fluent in En
glish, the obligation started 
to come back. I said, I promised
, I have to start. And I started with some of my friends 
who were American born, and little by little it 
grew. People listen and they said, oh, you 
know, we have a group of women, this will be
 interesting to invite you. And since I live 
in 
San Dieg o
, I did this for over 20 years here. And I was always recommended. I never 
put my  name in the papers that people did.
 But -- especially the Catholic school. They  
invited me three times. And I said to the teach
er, ﬁBut I™m repeating myself.ﬂ They said, 
ﬁWhat do you th ink we do? We repeating our 
lessons, but each time is a different class, 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
35
different people.ﬂ So I fulfille
d my promise and my obligati
on, and I never wanted to 
profit by it. I did this because this is my
 absolute responsibility
 to the people who 
perished. And if there are some individuals 
who do profit by it, I™m
 sorry they do. I™m 
happy that they do so me good by
 speaking, but I feel that it™
s almo st uneth ical to profit 
by it in any way. There is no glory in it, to -- 
to -- to be invited guest of honor here and 
there, and -- and have pictures
. It -- it doesn™t apply to me. 
Q: Let™s see, I just had a question that I forg
ot to ask. Sometimes -- where -- where else 
did you go? Yo-You mentioned Catholic
 schools, there were other places? 
Q: Oh yes, I went to schools, I went 
-- I spoke before high schools, I spoke in 
Santa 
Monica™s 
high schools, I spoke before 
Hillel
 groups, I spoke in churches. And I liked to 
go to churches, because I felt 
that Jewish people, and Jewi
sh organizations and Jewish 
groups that invited me, 
Havorah 
groups for instance, some people were there who were 
genuinely interested, but they knew about it. 
And some people said
 enough, it™s enough 
and they  did not want to hear this any mo re. 
So I thought if I woul
d speak to non-Jewish 
audiences, and I will reach just 
some of them, then I did some
thing good. And I did. I -- I 
spoke in few churches, especially  there is one
 church here, United Me
thodist, that I was 
invited -- that was a year ago, I think, and 
th e lady who invited me -- I went with her and 
she said, ﬁDo you mind there is a German la
dy in the wa -- in th
e church?ﬂ I said, ﬁOf 
course not.ﬂ And this German lady listened very intently. And she tried to tell me that she 
and her whole family were 
never Nazis. I didn™t -- I di
d not question her -- and her

36
grandfather would like to help people. I™m not 
interested in her story, and if they did 
that™s wonderful and she doesn™t have to expl
ain this to me. I am th ere on one purpose 
only, to tell people not my  personal story, 
but to spread my  message. And my  message 
always was one, let™s tolerate one another, le
t™s learn about each other. And I always say 
that people take this with a grain of salt, yo
u don™t have to love on
e another, but tolerate 
one another. Learn how to live together, becaus
e otherwise we jeopardize th-the en -- the 
entire -- the population is grow
ing fast, the earth is getting 
smaller. We™re flying from 
one place to another in few hours. If we won™
t learn how to get along, we will perish. 
Q: I-I know that this not something you want 
to get into detail necessarily, but let™s speak 
just a littl e bit about the price th
at you pay for this though. I me
an, i t is not -- it i s not easy 
for you to keep talking about 
this. What -- what -- what happe
ns when you do it? What -- 
what is the price you pay? 
A: I would deny if I would say that I don™t pa
y price for it. The price is my  health. My 
innermost feelings, my  -- my  dreams, my  nigh
tmares. But you have to decide, is it worth 
it? I know I™m getting older, I know that I am 
winding up my da -- my speaking days. I™m 

glad that I™m doing this for 
-- for the museum, that this will be on the tape. I will leave 
something behind it. Bu t I™m weaker. I™m getting older and my  
[indecipherable]
 are 
greater than before. Aside from 
the fact that I went through 
a -- a lot with my daughter, 
who had this terrible su rgery, it took a lot ou
t of me. And it was for me a big decision if I 
should do it -- this. But 
I said, I did the first part, I have to follow it up. I™m glad that you

37
ask me, I™m glad you came. I™m gl
ad that this will be in archiv
es. I hope that it will be of 
some use, and it will do some
 good by reaching the right 
people, and the 
wrong people. 
Q: Can -- can we go back to your life in 
New York
 for just a little wh
ile more? We spoke 
about 
Israel
 as being a very important thing that happened in your life, had a great 
impact. 
Yad Vashem.
 Your daughter, obviously, bein
g born was -- was an incredible 
thing. What -- what else when 
you think back? Anything in the 
60™s or 70™s that was sort 
of -- an event that sticks out that 
was important to you as an American? 
A: Well, a -- a ba -- the very important event 
that happened to me, that touched me very 
much, strangely, it is the creation of 
Israel. 
It -- it -- it was an unbelievable impact. Of 
course, I remember 
G o lda Meier
 came to 
New Yo rk 
to speak at the 
Madiso n 
Square 
Garden before it was razed. And I wa
s there with my girlfriend. And 
Ed McMa ho n,
 who 
was the ma n for -- who always introduced 
Jo hnny
 
Ca rso n
, he was the MC. He 
introduced 
Golda Meier
. And 
Golda, 
the -- the elderly lady, with
 the swollen legs, with 
the big, heavy stockings and 
big, black shoes, I remember -- will never forget. Ugly 
woman, speaking in  the mo st beautiful Englis
h, speaking from her heart. And I remember 
the place was packed. I don™t kn
ow how I got in, I don™t remember that, but I was inside, 
and I remember they -- down th
e aisles, young people were holding four corn ers of Israeli 
map with 
Magen David
, white with the 
Magen David
 and people were just throwing 
money in to it. And I threw whatever I had 
in my  pocketbook. This was a tremendous 
thing. Jewish people will have their homela
nd. It was something that I think only some

sect of fundamelis -- fundament 
-- fundamentalist predicted that 
Israel 
will come back. 
And there it was. Now, I myself was not the material to  go to 
Israel
 and fight and -- 
however, it was magnificent. That day will 
stick out in my mo r -- memory forever. 
Incidentally , there is one person, I don™t know
 if that museum would be interested in, 
non-Jewish. The lady is in her late 80™s, lives he -- here in 
Sa n Diego
. We became great 
friends. We met in a w riting club, because I wa
s going to writing classes, I love to write. 
She and her husband took pa
rt in the creation of 
Israel.
 Her husband came home in 1945, 
or ™46, I don™t rememb er when, when the wa
r was over, he was a veteran. And he didn™t 
have a job. He was recruited, not knowing 
for what and for where, by so mebody by the 
name 
Al Schwimmer
. They  took him -- she di
dn™t know where he we
nt, they took him to 
Czechoslovakia
, they got few planes there, he wa
s airplane mechanic. He was fixing 
planes so 
Israel
 could get six planes. This was when 
they -- before the 
war started. She 
didn™t know for a few months where he was,
 he was not allowed to let her know. And 
eventually he went to 
Israel, Israel
 was created, and sh e followed him, and she spent two 
years in 
Isr ael
 with him, working as an English steno -- some position th ere. And sh e 
saying -- said -- she wrote a book about it. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
A: She wrote a book ab out it. I have a copy. 
She said what -- what was supposed to be 
our work became our cause. This
 lady spoke about it, I invite
d her to some groups to 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
39
speak about it. Her husband was one of 
the heroes, unsung hero es who helped  
Israel
 into 
being. Non-Jewish, young man, he died last
 year. She™s about 89, 
she still goes to writing 
classes. I wonder if mu seum would like to ha
ve her story. If you have a chance, tell them 
she is an extraordinary person. 
Q: I will. And now it™s on tape, too. Is there a
nything before -- I want to also talk a little 
bit about 
Sa n Diego
 later, but is there anything in  
New York
 in your life, you stayed 
there for 20 years, that -- that stick s out as
 an -- as an important event or something? 
A: Th-This was one of the mo st important ev
ents. The other events
 were my friendship 
with two ladies, especially. Es
pecially the one, she came from 
Vienna 
originally, we 
went to museums together, we shared interest
s. I loved M-Metropolitan. And we went to 
concerts. There was nothing of tremendous imp
act there. I was alw ays the class mother. I 
always went on trips for the school. I -- when 
the teacher needed  a helper I was ready, 
because I didn™t work. I supervis
ed. I loved being with the child
ren, so -- I alw ays stayed 
in touch with the people whose children I wa
s working for when they were born. I -- 
Q: You could say something about your hu
sband and you being ve
ry  civic minded. I 
mean, you really -- 
A: Yes. My husband I were always -- we shar
ed the idea that once you become a citizen 
of this country, you owe some
thing to this country. And we
 are both civic minded. In 
New York
, when my husband 
work ed and I didn™t, I volunteered for 
Albert Einstein 
Hosp ital, and they ask me -- fi
rst they put me to 
count pills in the basement, which blew

40
my mind off. I thought that I -- I w ill get crazy  th
ere, I couldn™t do it. So I asked them to 
transfer me to the library cart. And I was wa
lking with the library cart, and people who 
were able to read magazines and books, I di
d this. I had a uniform and then I talked my 
friends to do it, and we did this for quite 
awhile. And my  husband wants me -- came to 
San Diego
 when he retired, this is 
21 years that he volunteers in
 three hospitals, four days 
a week. And he is -- he has all kinds of 
awards, you can see it on the wall up there. He 
was always civic minded. He is appreciated
 in the hospital and it makes -- it makes our 
life easier in the way that we are not two el
derly people sitting on t
op of one another, but 
we have some different interests. He loves 
his hospitals, I do not lik
e hospitals. I like to 
stay away from hospitals. But 
there are some people who are needed there. And he 
fulfills this need. He™s in ch
arge of volunteers for the emer
gency room. He stays in the 
emergency room, and the lady th
at I met today wh en I picked
 you up, wo rked
 for him in 
the emergency room. Which sh ows 
you how small this world is. 

Q: Have you ever associated with co -- w
ith survivor groups, or with survivors? 
A: There is a survivor group in 
San Diego
, and I went to one meeting there. But at this 
particular meeting -- the people are very active,
 and they do a lot of things, and there are 
a couple of them that do speak. One of th
em wrote some book. What bothered me was 
that he always peddles this book wherev -- ever y store you go to. He sits there, I will sign 

it, I will sign it, and this turns me off. An
d sometimes a lot of them were speaking 
Yiddish, wh ich I didn™t. So I decided that 
I can be a very  good civic minded survivor 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
41
without being in the group. I 
will do my part without being a 
part of the group. The group 
is very nice, very good, they donated m-money 
for the wall, I believ e, that this -- and they 
have a mo nument, some sort of monument. And 
I sent my money to -- 
as much as I could 
to Jewish American Congress, and to the 
Shoah 
Foundation and to th e Ho locaust 
Museum, 36 dollars, which supposed to have some significance because it™s twice 18, 

which 18 is life, 
[indecipherable] 
which I learned.  
Q: I have only maybe two more questions. On
e is just a -- a quick
 fo llow-up question on 
your daughter. Could you maybe say again that 
-- it was very hard for her to hear details 
about what was done to you, right? 

A: Yes. 

Q: She didn™t -- cou -- could y
ou speak to that a little bit? 
A: Yes. When we lived in 
New Yo rk
 and my daughter was already a teenager, and -- and 
-- and even tw -- 19 - 18 - 19 -- and they were 
forming groups of second generation, my  
daughter did not join it. Now, I asked her abou
t it. She said she lives with it, seeing my 
body, it reminds her enough of Ho locaust. Sh
e could not associate with a group and 
speaking about it, it hurt her too much. She want
ed us to have a normal life without m-
mentioning. It -- it -- sometimes it was a 
-- wa -- she wondered how could I go on and on. 
She said, ﬁMommy , I would like you to stop, 
you are torturing your
self. I want you to 
stop it.ﬂ She meant well, and she does her civic 
duty. Sh e contributes to it, but she could 

 
Interv iew with Bla n
ka  Rothschild   
March 16, 2001  
 

 
42
not speak about it because she -- in her heart 
it is a feelin g of tremendous pain, seeing 
what has happened to  me during th e war. 
Q: And she also had a hard 
time hearing exactly what -- 

A: Well, I did not tell her details. I told her, I 
never made secret of it, how I surv ived  the 
war, and -- but nothing that -- the gross details. 
She had to  know, but at the same token I 
didn™t want to go overboard , because this was 
a child. I didn™t want to poison her mind. I 
had to find the middle road, for 
her to grow up to be a bri
ght, open-minded person. And I 
hope that I achieved this. 

Q: Let™s talk about your granddaughter a littl
e bit. You did have a -- you do have a 
granddaughter, and when was -- when was she 
born, and what is he
r rela -- what™s her 
name and what is your relationship to 
[indecipherable]
 
A: My granddaughter™s name is 
Alexis Danielle
. She was born in 1978. She™s the joy of 
all our lives. She is beautiful in and out. Sh e™s bright. She graduated 
Duke 
University
. 
She had a lot of friends there, whom she misses
 terribly now. She is in her first year of 
law school, wants to study environmental la
w. She™s romantic. She wants to save the 
world. She wants to contribute to th e betterm
ent of the world, the human race. S h e™s an 
advocate for the animal rights, trees, water. S a
ve -- save -- save the trees, save the water. 
She is not one of the crazies, 
she™s a very normal young lady.
 And we are very proud of 
her. And we hope that she will achieve what sh e set out to do. Her father is an attorney 
too, but in a different area, not criminal, 
he™s a litigator. And she 
has very happy home

43
life. Her parents are very loyal, wonderful 
couple. I was very lucky that my  daughter 
married a man who™s a wonderful husband and 
father and provid es cultural background. 
They  do go to theater very often, my  
daughter loves theater, and she exposed her 
daughter to the loves, as I did her, even when 
I couldn™t afford it, my daughter can afford 
it now. So 
Alexis 
is very well rounded young person, as is my  daughter.  
Q: T -- only two more questions. 

A: Yes. 
Q: One, you refer to your ag e that you ar
e getting older. What does -- what does age -- 
what changes with age, or what
 has changed for you particular with regard maybe to -- to 
memory or also to events
, the impact of -- of -- of the Holocaust to you. 
A: Well this is a -- this is a serious question. 
I am aging and I feel this with every minute, 
more so. And so metimes I rebel, b ecause I lo
st so many years when I could have been 
doing th ings and learning, my  -- my  young years in the camp s. Each year could count for 

50. So I rebel that in my older age I have 
-- I have a big baggage, not only physical, but I 
have this -- this -- in the back of my mind, 
the -- the guilt feelings. I live with it. I will 
never get rid of it. So old age is -- it™s not 
so sweet. The only sw
eetness is the family. 
Q: Is th -- is memory -- 
is memo r y  fad i ng  too ? 
A: The memory is -- I found ou
t that short term memory is fading, but I was reassured 
that young people do it too.
 So when I will see somebody,
 I say how are you, without 
mentioning the name. But the l
ong term memory, there certain
 things that are blending

because it was so fast. When we
 were running, for instance.
 I don™t remember some of 
them. I don™t remember -- and I mentioned th
is many times, the face of my torturer. I 
erased his face from my memory because I di
dn™t want to be haunted by it. I don™t 
remember the faces of the 
[indecipherable]
 and the 
SS
 women who were so cruel. I 
don™t want to rememb er, I don™t want to see th
em in my dreams. So subconsciously  this 
is gone. I know the fact, but I don™t reme
mb er the faces. Some of my  friends who 
survived, they rememb er the 
-- the smallest details and ye
t when we were invited to 
Ravensbrück,
 
Sachsenhausen,
 I received invitation. I c
ould go free with my  husband, 
pay fare, and pay three days stay. The program 
that was sent to me 
had a concert, visiting 
the 
SS 
barracks and something else. And I very po
litely denied -- I mean refused. I did 
not want to go back. I 
am not anxious to see 
Sach senhausen
 or 
Ravensbrück
. I don™t 
want to see the barracks. I don™t need to se
e this. I never went back , I never went to 
Dach au
 or 
Auschwitz
. I know about it, I don™t have to
 go to see it. People who went 
during th e war, if they go, it™s good. Let them 
perpetuate the me mory of it. I don™t need  
it. And th-the invitation for thre
e days paid  to fly, well it wa
s to me  almost an i n sult.  
Q: Six years, roughly, of the Ho locaust, the wa
r years, almost 55 years after. Is -- is the -- 
is there a weighing? Wh at is -- the 50 year -- th
e 55 years after the war, are they as strong 
as the six years? Is there -- can one 
weigh this -- this -- have you --

A: They are two different lives. There is no co
mp arison. There is nothing that I can say -- 
I can weigh one against the other. The six ye
ars of imprisonment were -- German word, 
ewigkeit. 
Q: Eternity? 
A: Eternity. These years now, especially now 
th at I grow older, passing by very quick ly, 
too quickly. I want to live lo
ng enough to see my  granddaughter graduate, to see good 
things. To see her get married, and then I™ll 
be comp letely happy. To hear from people 
again -- I have listened to you, and I appreci
ate it. I learned something from you. I 
adopted some of your ideas. I hope that some b
ody sometimes will read
 or see my tapes in 
Washin gton
 and will let me know. It would be a 
-- a tremendous thing to know. I -- I 
received a lot of letters from schoolchildren,
 from people who listen, even from the 
sisters in the Catholic school. I send them -- not
 all of them, but a -- a lot of them to the 
Holo caust Museum, but I would like to know 
in the museum itself, 
if teachers who come 
for information, or somebody -- if somebody st
umbled upon one of my  tapes, or visual, 
or oral, and that I mad e some impact, that 
would be wo nderful. It would be something -- 
fulfillment. 
Q: I think this is where we shou
ld stop th en. Thank you very mu ch, 
Blanka
. 
A: You™re welcome.
