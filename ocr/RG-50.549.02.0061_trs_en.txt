Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Morris Ko
rnberg , conducted by Margaret West, on 
September the 27
th
, 1999, in Waldorf, Maryland. This
 is a follow up interview to a 
USHMM videotaped  interview conducted 
with Morris Kornberg, on March the 15
th
, 
1990. The United States Holo
caust Memo rial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff 
and Toby Herr for making
 this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. 
Mr. Kornberg, I wonder if you™d start by telli
ng me your -- your name, your parent™s 
names, the details of your 
birth, and your siblings. 
Answer: Ok ay. My  name -- oh, you are  hold ing it? 
Q: Yes. 
A: My name is Morris Kornbe
rg. Actually, f -- at home they
 used to call me, because I 
come from an Orthodox
 home, Moshe, Moshe Kornberg. 
And I was born in Po land, in 
Chadbush. My fathe
r™s name was Menachem Rafar 
Rafael. Menachem Rafael. My 
mother™s name was Y entla. Her maiden name
 was Malkavietska. My -- the oldest in 
our family was my sist er Sarah. She was mar ried. Her husband™s name was M o she 
Alexander. They  had three kids, the oldest 
was a girl, an d she ha
d two boys. Then was 
my  oldest brother, his name was Haim. He was managing -- my  father was semi-
retired, and he took over the business, and 
he managed the business until -- as long as I

remember, until the war started, an d I didn™t
 see him any more. Next I have another 
brother, his name was Ayah . He left Poland, 
he was in a kibbutz in Poland, he left 
Poland, he went to Israel to build Israel up.
 And th is was probably  in 1933. Then next I 
have a sister, she was still single, and her 
name was Miriam, in Polish used to call it 
Manya. She was at home, living with the fa
mily. Then I had another brother, his name 
was Abraham, and he was still single, he wa
s three years older than me, and I was the 
youngest in our family. 
Q: So th ere were six of you altogeth er? 
A: Right, six brothers and sisters. 
Q: I™m correcting that because much of
 the Holocaust material said seven. 
A: Any time that you have any questi
on, I™d be glad to answer it.  
Q: And both your parents were
 -- were Jewish, and brought
 you up in -- practicing a 
sort of Orthodox Jewish faith. 

A: Right, exactly, yes. 

Q: I was interested in the fact th
at you were educated privately -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- and I wonder if you™d tell me mo re about 
-- mo re about that, and also the fact that 
after the age of 14 or 15, y
ou were given mo re freedom? 
A: Yes, that™s correct. I -- I was raised in 
a strict Orthodox family, more or less my 
father belonged to Hassidim. And -- but th e 
only difference was, he was not a fanatic 
either. We had been home -- th
ree brothers and sister, we always brought home Zionist

organization™s books. We had to  do always -- pa
rents, my father™s j-job was to keep us 
busy. So  we could do anything. Ou r education,
 he never rejected it, or tell us he want 
us to read. And actually, what we used to
 bring home, always books, and all those 
brothers and sisters, he practically read
 all books, although he was mo re a model 
Orthodox person. 
Q: And was it usual to give young men mu ch 
more freedom when th
ey reached the age 
of 14 or 15? 
A: More or less. I think this what it was.
 Til 14 - 15, actually, we had to go along 
always, like the services, special on Shabbas,
 on holiday s, we alwa
ys went along with 
my  father, and it would be not 
nice for us not to go along, so we went along. Bu t after 
we had been 15 years old, we still went fo
r education, Jewish 
religion, and higher 
learnings. But my  father had en ough, was 
wise enough to see that the wo rld is 
changing, and you cannot stay al
ways in -- how he would like 
it, so he gave us more -- 
all brothers and sisters, freedom. After 
fif -- 15, we could d -- go our way.  
Q: I wonder if you™d also tell me how you vi
ewed your family™s position. In the -- the 
videotaped interview, your -- you cover you
r family history, but would you tell me 
whether they should be regarded as urban or
 rural? As middle class, as a better off 
family? 
A: Oh, our family was a very gr
eat family, with lots of love
. Kids for parents, and vice 
versa, parents for kids. Our economical stat
u s was fairly  good, better than average. 
And the most of all, it cannot go higher with
 regards in us to our parents, and vice 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
5
versa, the parents to us. I fe
el that love like this cannot 
be greater, and will never be 
greater, at the times w h at I spent home, 
and close the circle with our family. 
Q: And I assume that it™s th at family background that en
abled you to -- to cope with 
life. 

A: This is a question actually, I cannot 
answer too good of it, because under the 
circumstan ces, I practically gave up life th
e day when I was arrested. This was in 
January, must been around Ju
ly or August, and I was in
tegrated for Gestapo, and 
beaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear
 was, for me actually, beating, because 

they used to beat me when
 I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out. When I 
passed out, they didn™t have running wate
r, over there at the police station, they 
dragged me out to a well, where they poured
 water on my  head , and I was revived, dra 
-- dragged back inside, and again beating, and 
beating. And this was my  biggest fear of 
it was beating. And I begged the officer who 
interviewed me to shoot me on the spot. 
He laughed, and he to ld me, ﬁYou don™t ha
ve to worry about this. You don™t nec -- you 
don™t have to expect tha -- that you will live.
 But we finish you o
ff not when you want 
it, we finish you when we want it.ﬂ This was the answer.  
Q: Did you ever know why they  were que
stioning you, and what information they 
wanted to get from you? 
A: Yes, it™s a big story, I gonna try to -- 
just to tell you in mo re details. We had 
busin ess, all kind of bus -- my  parents star
ted  actually, with a grocery store, good 
busin ess. But wh en my mo  -- my  oldest brot
her, Haim, w h en he was more or less in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
6
his 20™s, early 20™s, and he slowly took ov
er busin ess by our pare
nts, and he always 
looked at a food store, little grocery store, 
we could make a living,
 he made a living, 
but he couldn™t make money all the -- actually 
for a better life. So he started it, he -- he 
was a representative -- in our town, sma
ll town in Chadbush was four smaller 
factories. They all produced  the same product,
 more or less, like knives, forks. And the 
mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn™t 
the most cheapest actu
ally, tableware, what 
you can have it. And this us
ed to be shipped to Galeet
sia, farther down near the 
Russian border where we had it. And my  br
other used  to supply raw materials, and 
apparently , I don™t know exactly, but he ma
de always so mu ch percentage on the 
supplies profit. And this got better and bette
r every time, with more -- and the season 
mostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f 
-- smaller factories was about four or five 
months of the year, where business were real
 good, and about six, seven months were 
slack. And they had a rough tim
e to meet payrolls for the work ers what they kept on. 
And my  buth -- my  brother used  to borrow mone
y, actually to those factories, not for a 
favor, but actually to make some  money, too.
 So they paid so 
much percentage per 
month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I 
was too young to know 
about business. Then 
finally he invested in one particular factor
y, it belongs to a Gen
tile in out town, his 
name was Rochinsky. And he had a little bit 
rough time to repay it, whatever he owed 
us, so he took -- he proposed  my  brother to 
be a partner in the factory. And th is went 
on til war time [indecipherable]
. In 1939, when the Germ
ans came in, my brother 
realized it™s another -- a different era alrea
dy. We -- as being we
ll and ev erything, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
7
we realized that we shouldn™t show that we 
had any interest in the factory, because we 
know it, that Jewish property was confisca
ted right from the beginning. No body went 
down, because before the war, since 1937, my
 brother send me over to the factory to 
get the fa-familiar with the proc
edures, how to deal with th
e people who worked in the 
factory, and how to  deal with customers 
who buy -- bought our me
rchandise; to get 
familiar with it. But since -- 
when the Germans ca
me in, this stopped, so my brother 
said, ﬁDon™t mention any mo re, you stay home
 like anybody else.ﬂ And take -- in 19 -- 
the end of ™39, we had to go
 in to live in a ghetto. So 
we lived in the ghetto, and life 
got terrible expensive because Jewish people 
never got any rations, because rations for 
Gentiles -- they used to get 
the food cards every month, but
 didn™t got. So the Black 
Market was very high. If you want buy a loaf
 of bread, you have to
 buy -- you have to 
pay 10 times the value, and so an y other prod
ucts. Well, life got to get very expensive 
until 1940. In 1940, they a
rrested the owner, Rochinsky 
was arrested for Gestapo, 
because he was more or less 
a intelligent person. 
They had been sc
ared, the Germans 
didn™t trust the more intelligent people. An
d he was taken in the 40™s, to Auschwitz. 
After two, three weeks -- we didn™t know mu
ch about the Auschwitz
 in 1940, but after 
two, three weeks, came a telegram that he™s
 not any more alive,
 and his clothing was 
sent back to his widow. And my  brother said
 -- we have been three brothers at home, 
and the oldest brother, he had already lik
e a green band, instead had the white arm 
band with  the Star of David, he used to ha
ve a green band with the Star of David. The 
green band meant actually that you are priv
ileged. A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
8
ride the train, or go out after seven o™cl
ock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street. 
They  had still curfew for Jews. And ev eryw
here, wherever, you co uldn™t move freely, 
but if you had a green band, you
 could ride the train, you 
had been -- you could move 
freely, you could go out afte
r seven o™clock actually. And 
this was a -- of course, the 
German government required if
 you would supply so me meta
l products, even scaret of 
metal.  So many pounds, was 
-- I don™t know exactly, they 
gave you a green band that 
you are priv ileged Jew, and y
ou could go mo re or less freely, wherever you wanted. 
He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it 
-- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- 
forced to perform some labor
 for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. I was 
assigned in a quarry, a stone qu
arry, actually, and was very 
-- pretty hard work, but it -
- in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 
hours, I don™t know exactly either, how many 
hours we wo rked , we could go home and sp
end with our family 
at h o me. This went 
on, but still my brother said that he going to
 see a very -- that I get a green band, too, 
that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarr
y. True, he had some 
connections in a larger
 city with some Jewish, more or
 le ss, leaders f rom the Jewish 
community, and they  had connection, they  ha
d been  able to bribe Gestapo, and SS. 
Bribing, if you gave money 
or some products what they wanted it, you could get 

favors from them, and they did it. When  my  br
other arranged the same way, he had to 
pay money for it, that I will be 
assigned, to start to be as 
-- to go every day to labor in 
the city, that my assignment will be to put 
in labor in the factor
y, to work in the 
factory, to perform labor, whatever it was [i
ndecipherable]. At this time the factory 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061

was idle, because Mrs. Rochin sky, she was -- she had three girls, an d she was not able 
to manage a factory, she didn™t know it. Be
sides this, when the Ge
rman came in, they 
right away, they froze all salaries. Prac
tically  anyplace where s -- they had 
[indecipherable] employees, they couldn™t pa
y any higher wages than -- than pre-war 
wages. And this was a problem, because 
whatever they have
 to buy, food for 
themselves, even with  rations, or you want
ed to buy something better, was sayvay four 
or five times as much as pre-war, [indeci
pherable] nobody wanted the war. When I -- 
when  I had the permission to go down  perfor
m my  job in the factory, my  brother set 
me up, that I should get in contact with th
e employers who used to  wo rk before the 
war, and tell them if th ey come
 to work, they will 
be able to earn three times, or four 
times as much as they earned 
b-before the war. And they sh
ould be -- come to work  to 
do th eir job, and we will pay them real good.
 I started to organize, and th is -- people 
started to come back, until I 
opened the factory and starte
d to produce. But, it was a 
problem. You had to  have books, becau
se you never know 
when the German 
government going to co me to check your bo
oks. So e -- we have been forced to have 
double bookkeeping. One set 
of book was actually what we did pay them. Same way 
we used to get -- we used write [indeciphera
ble] what we sold to
 dealers, we sold 
mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave th
em a bill, the price like before the war, and 

they paid  us the same way, two, three tim
es this amount. But the poin t was we still had 
to keep double 
bookkeeping, until one of those days, 
and this was apparently in ™41, 
one of the employee, he was not mad at me , 
he work over there 
a long time already, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
10
and he knows me, and he saw me before th
e warm I was in the factory involved. And 
he got a -- with a disagreement with the ow
ner in -- in the place, and he went to 
Gestapo, and he told  them that the factory 
actually belongs more to
 us than it belongs 
to her, it™s a Jewish factory, and he told all 
kinds. For example, we
 used to have, when  
we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our 

merchandise, we always had been afraid th
at someday the Gestapo will come, and they 
will confiscate everything. And where we used
 to keep finished merchandise, not far 
away from the factory in a village, and it 
used to be hidden aboll where we could 
always ship this merch andise, because we 
never know if -- when  they will come to 
confiscate the factory. And he told the Gest
apo everything, wh at is going on, that the 
merchandise is in a ab oll in the next villa
ge. And finally, one day, like I said, must 
have been July or Au gust, 
a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should 
come down to this jontamarie, where they 
had their headquarters. Normally, our town 
was a small town, we didn™t had, actually, 
Gestapo, SS in  our town, only jontamarie 
we had it. But once in -- every few weeks,
 two, three weeks, what I don™t know 
exactly, they used to 
come in a larger town
, SS, they -- if they 
had any complaints to 
take care cases, this when th
ey come in to take care the -- of those busin ess. And iv a 
the policemens told me I am 
called  to the jontamarie, to 
come down. And I remember, 
and I can remember it exactly
 like today. I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, 
and it didn™t help me that I have to go down,
 but it help me the su
ffering in my mother, 
and so my father, too. I went 
down in a slee
veless shirt -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
11
Q: Let me go back and ask -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- ask you to  describe your mother™s e
xpression. Because that would be something 
that™s always stayed with you. 

A: Expression of my mother was -- it™s unfor
gettable, because like I just said, it™s 
exactly -- I can see it w ith my eyes right
 now, how her expression was -- she felt 
scared. She didn™t know it -- what it will 
happen to me. And I co
uld read anything 
what she had in her mind, I saw it with my  
eyes. I saw my father -- I was sleeveless, I 
didn™t took even my 
jacket, and I told them, I ha -- I 
practically shivered, and I said, 
ﬁPlease don™t worry about it, I will be
 back in a couple hours.ﬂ But -- 
Q: Also, have you th ought about why th ey
 -- why they  took you?
 Was it because you 
were younger, and might speak more freely?
 Why they  took you, and not your older 
brother. 
A: Because I was in the factory. 

Q: And your older brother, Haim? 
A: My older brother, he was still traveling 
around, and he dealed with raw materials. 
Yeah, but I was in the factory [indecipherable] 
Q: I see, so you did know mo re. 
A: -- actually. And so the -- everything -- wh
atever he me ntioned it, he mentioned me 
as a -- you know, the double boo
kkeeping, and everything th
at I was involved . And so 
this why they called me. And I went down, it 
was a pretty warm day, and I came down 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
12
over there, and I was called in in a room, 
where I saw a v ery high officer. I couldn™t 
tell his rank, I™m not familiar, but he was 
a very high officer. And I looked, he had a 
stack of papers, maybe two, three inches high
, and he start to ask me questions, if I am 
in the factory over there, if I help manage the factory. And right away I realized, when 
I saw this stack of papers, I realized what th
e questions are, that he knows more than I 
myself know, because of I realized that it™
s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything 
fully -- fully to cooperate w
ith them. But this was not a 
big deal, cooperation did not 
help to save me. He called in two strong 
guys from the Gestapo.
 Young guys, strong 
guys. And they had like a special chair, like 
to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my  
belly to lay over there, that
 my  back, everything is exposed. And they  came in with -- 
the -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry
, when they went on the street, made from 
leather -- I don™t know even 
how they call this in Eng lish, I don™t recall, exactly, 
whatever. You know, for beatin
g somebody, just on the street
.  They saw a Jewi sh kid, 
or whatever, they beat over th
e head with it, something like 
this. And they 
told me to 
lay down on my belly on this
 chair, whatever it was, it
 was built special for this 
purpose, actually. And in both sides, right
 and left, kept on pounding in my  body, 
actually. And actually, it™s impossible. I was y
oung, and strong at th
is time, ma ybe, but 
beating like this, I don™t think any human can 
take it. And I used to pass out. When I 
passed out, they dragged me out to the well,
 they pumped water on 
my head. As soon I 
came back, they dragged me b
ack in, and again and again and again. And I always was 
more on the floor anyway, especial with th
e beating, I couldn™t stand straight any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
13
more. They didn™t give you a chair to seat, 
and so you had a choice
, all to be on your 
all four on the floor, or actually -- you know
, to stay, you couldn™t
 stay. I was always 
on th e floor. I went -- he was sitting at the ta
ble, he had very polis
hed, high boots on it, 
and I remember I practically was very -- pret
ty close to his boots. And I told him in 
German, ﬁPlease shoot me. Please finish me 
off.ﬂ And he laughed, looked in my eyes, 
he said, ﬁYou don™t have to wo rry about this
, but we finish you o
ff when we want it, 
not when  you want it.ﬂ An
d this went on hours and hours. This was actually -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg. This is tape number one, side B. I have a question about an 
earlier time, and that is that when the Ge
rmans invaded Po land, and you fled to the 
woods for a few days -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: What would be the reason wh y your home
 was spared, when mu
ch of the town was 
burned? 

A: This is a -- this is the same way, th
is -- you cannot ans -- for a question like this, 
this just happened to be that the -- first 
was b u rned the synagogu
e, what this was once 
in the -- famous all over the world, not in 
Poland, but all over the world, was a famous 
for art, and beauty, an d anything wh at is possi
ble, actually, to describe this synagogue. 
And the reason was actually the synagogue wa
s near a river what it went thro ugh our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
14
town, the Pilitsa. And it was a bridge, and th
e bridge actually was a wooden bridge. It 
was not a heavy structure, a wooden br
idge. And wh en th e Germans invaded, I 
remember it was on a Friday, the first of 
September was on a Friday when they c -- 
yeah, it was a Friday, and Saturd
ay they have been already 
over there. And so the first 
thing what they did, they tried to secure th
e bridge, they  -- they can co me in and cross 
wherever they wanted w
ith their armies. So th
ey put the bridge on fire, after they went 
in, and th is was near the synagogue, and be
cause the structure was a wooden structure, 
apparently  -- I don™t know, maybe they put 
bomb s -- firebombs actually on it before -- 
this i -- I don™t know either, because I actu
ally, my self, and so  the -- mo stly of the 
town, the whole town, run away
 in the woods. So we di
dn™t know exactly, but we 
know it right away th e next day, that 
the synagogue was burned. Actually, it was 
nothing left over from the synagogue. This 
-- this all as I can recall, actually. 
Q: I should say on tape that we -- we -- I 
changed the subject abruptly, but I should let 
listeners know th at your detailed story of y
our arrest and beating 
by th e SS officer, is 
told on the March 1990 videotape -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- at the Holocaust museum. 

A: That™s correct. 
Q: And I want to fill in some gaps from that earlier interv iew. 
A: Okay, go ahead, wh
atever you ask, I will -- if 
I can answer [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
15
Q: Yes. One of the questions was when  you
 were living in the ghetto, was that in 
C h ad bu sh ? 
A: Chadbush, the main place, actually, was 
Chadbush it was the 
name, but Chadbush 
was the -- a divided. On one side of the ri
ver -- of the Pilitsa, where the bridge was, 
was the one side was Chadbush, wh en you 
crossed the bridge, they called it Vidamma. 
Actually, it was the same town
, but it still, this was Chad
bush, and this was Vidamma. 
In the ghetto, when th
ey  had to leave everything, the 
houses, and anything, and go, the 
ghetto was actually made in
 Vidamma. The reason was be
cause it was already a little 
bit out of the town, and it was 
easier to petition it off with wi
res, or whatever, to make 
it that you cannot just walk ou
t of the ghetto as a free person. And th is was the easiest 
thing, cause of the German decided that 
Vidamma wi -- will be
 the ghetto, and this 
actually where all Jews, including my fam
ily, lived. In Vidamma
, in the ghetto. 
Q: I want to fill in another -- another gap,
 or clarify something,
 and this is moving 
ahead to when you we
re in -- I think it™s 
pronounced Javishavitz. 
A: Yavishavitz. This is actually -- I was 
four weeks -- probably it™s mentioned the 
same way, my first tape. I went -- after the 
beating, they took me
 down, back to the 
factory, and I didn™t know it even at this 
time, that the widow fro
m the owner, actually, 
she was a -- she was not Jewish, a Gentile, 
and she was arrested too, for the same 
crime like me, that we had 
double bookkeep ing, that 
we had hidden finished 
merchandise, whatever. So she was arrested, 
and I never knowed it -- that -- til he -- 
until four weeks later. But I -- I was -- first 
th ey put me in a jail in Chadbush. And

Chadbush was not a official -- 
a big jail, was a very small -- 
in fact, they 
used to call it 
-- I don™t know the name, accosa. A big jail 
is like jeminale, you know, but this was a 
small -- it was just for drunks, or whatev
er. Not too much, you 
know, criminals. And 
they hold me overnight. When 
I came to this jail, -- oh th
e first -- this was the first 
time in my  life I came in a jail, but we us
ed to hear stories, if you have been a 
newcomer in a jail, they made jokes with y
ou, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or 
whatever. This was the fun -- this how -- it us
ed to be a custom, and -- when  you was a 
newcomer in a jail. When I came in over -- to
 this jail, actually, th
ey probably realized 
I couldn™t walk straight, and mine back, 
everything, was black practically. But for 
some reaso n , they didn™t perform all thos
e jokes, what they used to do it for a 
newcomer. And they  felt mo re or less lik
e sorry for me, you know, that I was all 
beaten up, so they 
let me alone. Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a 
policeman, he was in charge of this small 
jail. And he knowed  my  parents, or he 
knowed me, too. So he came over to me, 
he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not 
Germans, but a Pole, and he came over, an
d he asked me if I want write home 
something to m -- to my parent
s about me. At first I hardly
 could even take a pencil, 
my hand to write any words, but I -- I said
 it™s necessary to write home. And I wrote 
home in the same way I think on th e ID cards
 what they distribut
ed in the Holocaust 
museum, what I took part thos
e -- they have this saying in
 sayvay things like this you 
cannot forget. I wrote home, and I said in 
my few words what I was writing, I told 
them please -- twice I said please, please forg
et about me, I be all right. Go on with

your life, noble. Just forget about me. This
 was in Chadbush still. This was my last 
word  to my parents and family. The next mo
rning they took me -- 
t h ey brought me - - 
it™s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the 
name is Koinsket. This
 is a larger town, 
and they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- 
prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for 
people who don™t obey the law, whatever, 
but it was much, much 
larger. I was brought 
in over there, first they to
ok me to Gestapo in Koinsk et, and I was real -- really 
concerned. I-I didn™t care, I was afraid just fo
r more beating, that I couldn™t take it any 
more. So I -- every minute I was over there, I 
just kept on lo oking when  they  start -- 
going to start to beat me again, but they ne
ver did. They  brought me over to th e jail. 
When I came into the jail, I wa
s released, that -- at least 
I wasn™t beaten any more, I 
came in over there. And the same thing, I kn
ow the procedure again, that those all in 
jail gonna make -- have fun, whatever. And 
they saw me coming in, and the same way 
they felt sorry for me, 
and they  know it that I™m not a cr
iminal, and they realize that -- 
why I am over there, because it was involve
d for politics too, because the bookkeeper 
from our factory used  to always to give me
 a -- handle over some mimeographs that 
used to come from th e underground, from 
the -- England, to te
ll you how the front 
goes on over there. And so  he told  th
em that I -- I have knowledge about the 
underground, too, was a -- this was part w
hy I was arrested, actually
. And they kept on 
coming, talking this over, how I behaved, an
d -- and I did whatever they told me. We 
have been in  a cell, probably was over ther
e th e same way, between 30 and 40 people, 
and everybody has a -- like in
 a corner, in a straw sack 
he had over th ere where you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
18
rested overnight to sleep, ac
tually. In the same way it was no modern facilities in this 
jail. We used to have a large can, real 
huge, and ev erybody -- wh at a human has to do 
it, or -- they did everything the whole night,
 in this large kettle -- can, whatever. And 
in the morning it was always they changed it.
 Two people, they used to carry out, and 
take care, and then was to sc-s
cru b  the floors, to keep it clean, everything. I recall after 
a f-few days that -- certain the third day, th
e fourth day, it was -- I w as in the line to 
carry this out, and scrub the floors, and so 
far. And I went over to do it, I didn™t look 
that somebody should do fo r me any favors,
 I went over like any other prisoner. And 
then one Pole came, and push
ed me away, and he said he
 will do this for me. I -- I 
didn™t want to fight it, I let him do it. And 
the same way, after a few days, maybe after 
a week, the one who was in ch
arge, like the warden in jail,
 he was not German, he was 
Polish, too. So he called me in his office, he
 came to me, I went 
down from that cell in 

his office. And he to ld me, ﬁDon™t be upset, 
you probably -- your 
brothers are work ing 
for you th at you going to be released. You wi
ll probably be -- be released if not this 
week, is next week, a third we
ek. But they wo
rk for you, to releas
e you.ﬂ It meant that 
they going to bribe the Gestapo for it. And he
 says, ﬁI know -- they  are in contact with 
me, and I will see that you ge
t food. You don™t have to eat
 that food from the jail. 
Somebody will bring in every day, food fo
r you. And so you goi
ng to have private 
food, not from jail. But,ﬂ he sa
id, ﬁjust -- this is a secret.ﬂ
 This is a very dangerous 
thing, I should never tell no
body what happened, what had 
happened. He will see that I 
will be supplied with food. An
d I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
19
know. I felt more comfortable,
 and so were all those other 
in the cell, the other person 
thas this -- they didn
™t know it, where I was exactly, 
but -- this was a secret when I 
called into the office, to this
 warden. But they saw somethin
g goes on, so I didn™t say a 
word, but they felt that I am 
better treated lik e anybody else, 
more or less. And so they 
tried, actually, always, what I had to do, 
they jumped in, pushe
d me away, and they 
used to do it for me. A nd we
 got along fairly well. This was -- actually, in jail over 
there, in Koinsk et, I was four weeks. I re
me mb er one day they br
ought in two Jewish 
people, because I was the only Jew on the -- in
 this cell. But they 
brought in a couple 
Jewish people, I know them. They have been  in Vidamoff, in the gh
etto, they lived in 
the ghetto. They  used  to be butch er -- but
chers, and they got 
caught by the German 
authority that they butchered a cow, or wh
atever. They took th
em, they put them -- 
they brought them over to th
e jail. And I can recall normally they have not been so 
religious people, a butcher, whatever, but 
one had along with him a prayer book, and 
the whole night he didn™t do nothing else, 
except he kept on praying from the prayer 
book. Prays -- was it -- to me it was not stra
nge, it was familiar, 
everything. And I ask 
my self, he™s not such hot religious person,
 why does he pray so much? What is 
happen, early in the morning,
 maybe five o™clock, still wa
s dark, they called off their 
name, they took them out, and we heard a fe
w shots. The others in the cell told me, 
ﬁYou know, they got shot. Th
ey killed them.ﬂ Over there, outside the jail. I didn™t 
know now -- think I didn™t know it
, if they are dead, if it™s tr
ue what they told me, but I 
know it -- it™s fa -- was not just calling off a name. We heard shots. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
20
Q: Do you know why 
they were killed? 
A: Yeah, because the same way, it was not 
allowed to butcher anything, especial on 
the kashru t you know, by a rabbi, and ev erythi
ng, this was their things, you -- this was 
not allowed. In fact, it was those -- the ghetto
 was so crowded, if a Christian, a Pole, 

start to bring in food to sell on -- for -- fo
r profit, on the black market, whatever, and 
he got caught by gendarmarie, 
whatever, they put them in jail, too. R -- they didn™t 
dare to -- even to bring in 
food, even to make money, th
ey been scared for their own 
life. 
Q: You said something that inter -- interest
ed me earlier, which was that the Gestapo 
may have felt you had knowle
dge of the underground. 
A: Yeah, they did. 
Q: Tell me more about that. 
A: The bookkeep er in the factory, he was 
probably  -- oh, probably  eight or 10 years 
older than me, because he was married, and ha
d I think, two, thre
e kids already. And 
he used to like, you know, to drink a little
 bit. He was -- he was a brilliant man, a 
brilliant mind, very brilliant. His name was 
Levandoski, and he fo
r some reason, he 
liked me. 
Q: Was he a Gentile, or a Jew? 
A: A Gentile, yeah, a Gentile. He liked me, a
nd they didn™t know it at home, he used 
to take me along to restaurants, where he us
ed to buy -- h-he -- he da -- was not so well 
off, you know, but he used to 
buy me that I d rink with him 
together, and I used to do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
21
it, actually, because he wasn
™t much older than me, a
nd young people -- young boys 
like me, I was at this time 20 -- 19 years old,
 so it was for me a privilege. I used to 
come home, my  parents used to think that I 
am sick, because they served dinner, and I 
didn™t eat it, I was not hungry, because I at
e with him in the restaurant. And the ta -- 
same way that he had touch with  the underg
round, actually. He used to take me home, 
even home, what is not allowe
d heah to foreign language 
-- foreign countries, and he 
used to, on short wave he ge
t always, he got BBC, and plus
 he used to get once a 
month, a mimeograph, a little thing, they told
 you on the front what is going on. And 
he always shared with  me, he really kept 
me -- I don™t know why, but like I would be 
his closest buddy. And he actually was arre
sted, too, before me
. They send him to 
Auschwitz, the same way, after a week, two,
 he came a telegram, he™s not alive any 
more. We didn™t know really what Auschw
itz means, what Auschwitz is, but we 
always was thinking, okilly, as soon you 
go over, a week  later comes a telegram you 
dead, so it™s -- must be more than what anybo
dy knows about Auschwitz. 
Q: So, in  fact, you wouldn™t really know for 
sure who told  the SS  about -- about you? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, I know it. 
Q: It was the disgruntled employee? 

A: It was a -- an employee, I knowed him 
very well. His name was Novokowski. He 
knowed me well, we got along real good. I 
don™t know -- he didn™t meant actually to 
hurt me, so much. He was tryi
ng to hurt the widow in the 
factory, because he was mad 
at her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
22
Q: Yes, but the -- the widow, in fact, sounds
 as if she always was very honorable in 
her dealings with you. 
A: Oh yeah, she respect us
, she respect our family. Sh
e knows how much money we 
have in -- it™s involved -- what 
we have over th ere in the factory. Plus, she felt at this 
time, you have been a woman, a lady, some
thing, you have no
t got involved  in 
busin ess. You was involved  to 
raise th -- your family, the th
ree girls, nobody™s home.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And so she was happy to s
ee that I take over the duties. 
Q: Yes, I wondered if that good relations
hip was unusual? I know that there was mu ch 

anti-Semitism in Catholic Poland, but perhap
s because they were somewhat part of the 
intelligentsia, she and her husband? 

A: Normally, actually, what it is, sure the an
ti-Semitism was a real great big, big, and 
every day got bigger actually, the anti-Semitis
m. This actually why br -- mine brother 

left in ™33, he saw it -- what is coming, mo
re or less. And he say he doesn ™t want to 
stay in Poland, doesn ™t want no part, so he 
just -- and he was a patriot to build Israel, 
this was the reason. We thought he is not
 normal, he goes away from the -- fro m the 
good home, and he used to say he™s as
hamed that we are making money easy, you 

know, he believe mo re you have to wo rk fo
r your money, not just from business. So 
far -- he was very, very much patriotic, but th
e -- with me, actually, I didn™t know it, I 
was over there four weeks in jail, and then
 suddenly, ab out -- after four weeks, I 
remember, yeah, someb
ody called my  name. And I recogni
ze right away this was the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
23
widow from the facto ry, Mrs. Rochinski, an
d she in Po lish calls me , you know, and -- 
and so if she™s -- and she -- I responded, ﬁYeah
, I am here, in this cell.ﬂ I don™t know if 
-- where she know it, or apparently  she kno
w it. And so she told
 me that she is 
released, sh e --after four weeks -- she was four
 weeks in jail, and she said she -- they 
released her, she goes home. She told me 
that I shouldn™t worry, I will go home. They  
had already the release for me, but they ne
ed a signature from a higher officer, and 
they have to go to another town for this high office signa
ture. ﬁSo you probably will be 
released tomorrow,ﬂ she told me. And they all -- the othe
r inmates in the cell where 
was -- I was with them, they all heard it, 
and everybody was happy for me, I going to 
go home tomo rrow. And th ey gave me addr
esses to go to their families, and their 
wives, tell them how they are, what they this
. It was a -- like a holiday already, the day 
when  she called us. But the next mo rning,
 early in the morning, this what the 
procedure [indecipherable] in 
the morning, they called o
ff my name, they called off 
other inmates name, but I -- some thing didn™t 
sound to  me right, because they kept on 
calling too many names. Because they used 
to do every few weeks, every month or 
two -- but I don™t know the same way, exactl
y how often they did it. They emptied the 
jails for new inmates. In ot
her word, they took those ja
ils, and they send them to 
concentration camps, like Auschwitz or whatev
er, and -- but wh en 
they took us, they 
tied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just 
with a piece string, like, actually, nothing, 
and they  put us on trucks, and th ey drove, 
I don™t know how many 
kilometer -- I never 
know even til today where I was. I think 
-- I assume it was Kelsa, b ecause from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
24
Koinsket, biz -- Kelsa was not so far, and to
ok about a co uple hours in a truck. And 
then they brought us 
to a market over there on the -- we
 have been told -- we saw all 
around SS, with machine guns, 
rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept 
on bringing to another jail, so I don™t know 
[indecipherab le] else, until they get it, a 
large quantity of people the 
same way and it -- it must ha
ve been several thousand, 
actually. Took quite a number of
 hours, until when we all have been, and you have -- 
lay on th e floor, on your knees, you could not ra
ise your head, if you raised your head, 
your -- they told us, then you will be shot
. You know, your -- right away they watched 
with rifles around over there, or machine 
gun. Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on 
the ground over there on this market, until actu ally they had the amount of people, or 
whate -- what they expected to have it on th
e jails, and they put us on cat -- those cattle 
wagons, in the same w ays. We used to se
e the one who guard ed some of them have 
been Wehrmarkt, and so we have been mo re
 friendlier, because you couldn™t just talk 
to one from the SS, he finish
ed you on -- off on th e spot. But we saw [indecipherable] 
they ask him where they take us, where we 
going to go, where we
 going. ﬁOh,ﬂ they 
used to say, ﬁoh, you go probably where 
you going to  have to l -- be over there, do 
some work, labor.ﬂ [indeciphe
rable] all, andwe
 didn™t know it until we arrived around 
midnight, probably, over there, and the firs
t thing I saw it when th
ey brought in, they 
opened th e gate, and it said, the gate said ab
ait bakt fry. And I didn™t know th at this 

was a g -- in Au schwitz a gate, didn™t know
 it. But as soon we -- we got off in 
restraints, although it 
was guard ed off -- they  have a bi
 -- large ramp -- 
ramp, and both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
25
sides have been guarded by SS . And they  ha
d sticks, irons, all kind things, and wh en 
they chase you out, and everything was schn
ell, schnell, fast, fast. And so you got -- 
wherever you move, wherever 
you go, it didn™t make any di
fferent. They hit you over 
your head , or your back. It depends how lu
cky you have been, a
nd we had to  keep on 
moving. And th is what we did, and then we
 saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped 
uniforms. We didn™t know it 
-- they start to talk, and th
ey said, ﬁHere™s Auschwitz,ﬂ 
you know? And some of them 
have been only over there 
from those kapos what they -- 
they want to kill you practi
cally on the spot. Any move, whatever it was, it didn™t 
make any different. It was only, you know, 
to make you so miserab le, that you will 
give up li -- living. The truth is, I gave up 
right away the first day when I was arrested. 
I figured this is the end. And I could s
ee it right away, wherev
er I was, that it™s 
nowhere in the world -- you know, the drea
ming that I will go home, see my parents, 
see my family, or be free. A lot of -- the fi
rst thing wh en I gave 
up, I figured what™s 
the use to fight? You cannot fight this, and 
why su ffer? So you -- no use to suffer 
either. 

Q: Well, what went wrong, 
do you suppose, in the plan
 that your brothers were 
work ing toward? It seems you came so close to being freed? 
A: Yeah, this is -- I don™t know. In fact, Jewi
sh people have not been  allowed to visit a 
jail if they have somebody 
-- like some other -- if you have been Gentile, you have 

been allowed, I don™t know, every two week
s, or every -- to see so me relatives or 
friend, but for Jewish people was not allo
wed. One time, the wa
rden from the jail

26
arranged that my  older brother from me  I wa
s the youngest, but next to me, his name 
was Abraham, that he come to see me, he 
can speak with me. So I wait, he called me 
out to co me to his office, took me out from 
the cell. There I was in his office, and he 
told me, look, this a -- 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview with Morr
is Kornberg. This 
is tape number two, side A.  
A: And he said he does it, but it™s not le
gal, it™s not allowed for a Jewish person to  

have any visits [indeciphera
ble], but he says, ﬁYour br
other gonna come to this 
window,ﬂ and he hold me over there by the 
window, and he said, ﬁYou talk to  your 
brother.ﬂ And I went in the window, I saw 
my brother, and he sa
id, ﬁMoshe.ﬂ And I 

said, ﬁAvrum.ﬂ We called each other™s name. And then the warden, he watched it 
pretty careful, and he saw through the window
 that a s -- ess -- SS car coming closer, 
and he didn™t know where they come, but ri
ght away he said, ﬁBack -- quick, back to 
the cell.ﬂ I went back to the cell,
 and I never saw nobody any mo re. 
Q: Too great a risk for the warden. 

A: Yeah, and th e next day, this wh en they  
called off and they brou
ght us to Auschwitz. 
And -- 
Q: I had wanted to ask, after you were 
-- you had been moved 
to  Au schwitz, would 
your family have been ab
le to trace where you were? 
A: Probably not. No way, I mean you -- th
is was so secr etly a
rranged, that nobody 
could trace nobody. No, this was not -- 
never -- impossible. This I know it. 
Q: Mm-hm. And your informa
tion about your family after 
that, were you able to find 
out anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
28
A: I never heard it, and I never met -- I ne
ver saw nobody, not s -- ever. Nothing. In 
the same w ay, even when I 
was in the Auschwitz, and I saw this is the end of the w-
world, and everything, but I ne
ver could forget not that I™m sufferin g  -- this was out of 
the question, I just felt for their suffering,
 sorry you know, but it 
didn™t help me mu ch. 
Q: So, despite much questioning, I -- I kno
w that you™ve checke
d wh ether any Jews 
had surv ived  in Ch adbu
sh, and there were -- 
A: None. 
Q: -- there were none left. 
A: None. Zero. 
Q: So, of your family of six, 
only your brother in Israel -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- is known to have survived? 
A: Right. 
Q: Do you have any other 
-- any other information at 
all about members of your 
family? 
A: I checked when 
th ey had one time -- the Red Cross arranged one time a reunion 
with other who have been with me in Ausc
hwitz. And so I had left all names, and all 
whatever the questions what they gave me 
to fill out, and for awh
ile they send me a 
letter that they have ev erythi
ng, they keep 
on checking. Then , maybe six months later, 
or a year later, they send me another letter, th
ey did their best, but they can never could 
place it -- any -- any of the 
names that I requested.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
29
Q: Mm-hm. In the years since then, have you ev
er gone back to that area, or ever felt a 
wish to? 
A: You mean my  birth home? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. This was in 1945. Finally, I was -- th
e last dead march -- I -- I made more than 
one dead march, that was made in the e
nd of Decemb er, between Ch ristmas and New 
Year. The first dead march was from Ausc
hwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald. 
Then, from Buchenwald
 I™d say where I was in a 
subcamp from Buchen wald , the 
name was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig. A
nd around early April, or the end of March 
they say the -- the allied forces
 start to get closer. Well, the 
first thing, they put us for a 
recreation, too, they  kept on. They kept 
us in tw o weeks what 
is -- you know, I don™t 
want go into details, because 
y -- it -- I will never be able 
to even finish, even if you 
stay a whole week. It was -- I 
did survive the dead march. Th
ey kept us on trains, we 
used to go in  the woods for a day. I just f
ound out later that they used to, every day, 
from one place to the other place was maybe 
10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have 
been -- our train was on a one track line. We 
didn™t go nowhere, we just went from one 

place, and the next day we went back to th
e other place. And we thought -- we didn™t 
realize that this is the same place, we di
dn™t go nowhere. And I have been, for two 
weeks -- not me only, but all of us who su rv
ive what actually -- in
 a few thousand they 
started off when they evacu ate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left. In 

thousands, the all other been
 on th e -- on th e roads and the ditches, their bodies was

laying because they have been sh ot, th
ey have been exha
usted from walking, 
whatever, and au tomatically, if you couldn™t 
walk, automatically the guard shot you. 
Doesn™t make any difference. Bu
t I survived over ther
e. So the last thing, I arrived in 
Theresienstadt. And this was -- th e same way, you know, I -- I -- mu st be early of 
April. And at this time, when I arrived in
 Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99 
percent point nine dead, actu
ally. I have very little signs 
that I™m alive, actually. And 
in fact, it w as in -- a co incidence that -- even
 that I reached Theresienstadt, because in 
Litenritz, one night, when they -- those a
ll who -- who still have been alive, they 
brought us first the night befo
re -- we have been in I th
ink the camp called Litenritz, 
and this was terrible condi -- conditions. A
nd being two weeks without fo od, without 
water, even the little fo od what we used to 
get, but without this [indecipherable] it 
didn™t -- we have not been far away in 100
 percent to be dead. And what had happened 
in this Litenritz actually, that 
they said in the morning they
 going to serve us coffee, a 
hot, liquid something, whateve
r. And over there the barracks didn™t had even  floors, 
and laying in  mud, you didn™t had no bunkbed
s, nothing. If you laid down  for the night 
to rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid
 in  the mud. But noth ing to -- less, and 

nothing more but in the mud. And this was 
a terrible things, without everything, but a 
human, if you have anything, any instinct 
being a human, you know 
that this doesn™t 
go farther. I didn™t slept even the whole ni
ght, but probably I would have been  fall 
asleep, and waited actually that I™m going to
 get -- I know it would be a little b it dark, 

mud, whatever they called it, they called it co
ffee, but we get it. And we used to carry 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
31
always a can, a rusted can if
 they found it, if somebody going to  give us something, 
that we have a can to take the food. And ea
rly in the morning, th
ey called you, coffee. 
And I was trying to be from the first, because 
I know it if I don™t go to the first, I will 
never reach any more what they gave you. I 
was among the first, and they gave me the 
amount what -- in my  rusted coffee, and I ju
st pour it in -- in my  body, whatever they 
gave it to me. I -- I don™t know til today what
 it was. I just poured it in. And took a few 
hours, and they told us that
 the guards will come, they will 
take us to the next camp. 
We heard ab out Theresienstadt, we know 
th at Theresienstadt is not actually a 
concen tration camp, it™s a model camp. We -- 
we had not been afraid, we cannot go -- 
we cannot lose now, see, it cannot be wo rse 
than it is. And we ha
ve been happy that 
finally -- that we will -- we will reach Theres
ienstadt, but not always what you think is 
happening. For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I 
didn™t -- I don™t think th ey ev en had toilets
 in this camp , wherever. And I -- I was 
dehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn™t
 had it before because I was two weeks 
without food, without water. I was fairly de
hydrated an d I couldn™t get up. My friends, 
what we -- I know them from Auschwitz still,
 they came by and they said good news, 
[indecipherable] you know, we going to co me 
to Theresienstadt in the next hour or 
two. And I told the one that I know them
 very well, w-was in
timate friendship in 
Auschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz. His name was Y a
nkey. An d I told him, ﬁYankila, it™s too 
late for me.ﬂ And he said, ﬁIn the all 
suffering what you know wh at you had in  

Auschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,ﬂ 
he said -- he said, ﬁdon™t make me leave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
32
you here.ﬂ And they actually risked their 
lives, two of them, and they practically 
carried me in to Theresienstadt. But still I 
never had any hope that I will be able to 
walk, or for freedom. I realized it™s too late
 even to have any hope. [indecipherable] 
show it, actually, wh en we came to Theres
ienstadt we look like an imals, we act like 
animals. Those who still could walk were -- 
whatever they start to give us some 
rations, some of them who have been stronge
r, they used to see that -- used to pass by 
wagons that went to the kitchen for the 
supplies, and they  used to  highjack those 
wagons and steal everything out, 
bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there. 
And those people from Theresienstadt, those in
mates, they have been
 scared of us like 
wild animals, and it™s not just [indeciphera
ble], we have been. We look like animals 
[indecipherable] but after they 
too start to get help more 
or less, that some ladies, 
nurses came in, and they start to clean us up , because I still had the same clothing, the 
same shirt, or whatever, when
 I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December. 
And I never had another -- neve
r changed nothing, and th is 
was already practically the 
end of April, where they to
ok ev erything what we took o
ff they burned it on the spot, 

and they  gave us some clothing, mo re or 
less. And they  bathed us, and sh aved  us. I 
mean, they cleaned us 
up, they  disinfect us, more or le
ss. And then  we heard it already, 
that bring in in Switzerland, in Schwie
tz, they used to  send fo od o-over to 

Theresienstadt. Not only food,
 [indecipherable] the best 
f o od, you know, white bread, 
and ch eeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, th
e best from the best practically. But people 
-- people kept on dying like flies,
 actually. When they
 start to eat, this was the end of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
33
it. I actually, the beginning, I -- I felt that 
I ate, and I could take food, and I got -- felt 
that every day I™d get stronger and feel better. And for some reason too, I don™t know 
why, they picked me over there in Theresiens
tadt to be in charge of the food supply. 
To give out, to see how many 
rations to prepare were ther
e -- for the people who have 
been over th ere. There a certain amount of 
barracks, you know. One barrack was also -
- they called it a hospital, but the truth is 
it was like a dump. It was a matter, you know, 
they put you in, you co
uldn™t walk any more, they put you
 in in the bed.
 They know it, 
not in a matter of a day, but in an hour, y
ou will be dead, so they
 throw you out, and 
they put in another body in  the bed. And so
 went on -- actually
 99 percent all died, 
actually. Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- 
and I could feel that I get better and 
everything, but suddenly, I don™t know wh at 
went bad, or what we
nt wrong, or maybe 
because I was in close contact, I used -- I ha
d to go in in this 
barrack every day and 
count people who ha
ve been still alive. And the -- to 
know, you know, we need for this 
hospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital. 
We need 50 rations, 60
 rations. I used to, 
you know, the dead have been
 on the g -- floor already, 
on th e ground, I don™t know 
even if it was a floor over there. On the gr ound, and the living -- so I count the living 

so there™s how many rations to prep are. And 
I don™t know, in a matter of in a week or 
two, I just caught something 
like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don™t 
know, and I will not know ev
en, what had happened. For 
some reason, if it™s good 
food, whatever it was over there, and I could 
have as mu ch as I desire and everything. 
It was in a certain day, was like my mole was 
sealed off everything. I couldn™t take it, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
34
couldn™t look it. I used to go ah ead, and take
 a nice roll, white roll, and put down all 
kind cheeses and sausage, whatever. And I to
ld them -- this was -- not far away was a 
park over there, I says I going
 to sit on the bench in the pa
rk, and I will get an appetite, 
eventually, I believe. Nothinghelped. So I start to go ri
ght away, backwards, and it 
doesn ™t take long. Whatever I gained, I lo st mu ch, mu ch quicker than it took me to 
gain. And I couldn™t walk any more eithe
r. And [indecipherable] say well, you have -- 
said you -- you go to  the hospital. I know it,
 what it is, but it was not -- it didn™t matter 
to me, it was no difference. I realized whatever
 it is, it™s too late fo
r me. I went to the 
hospital, as I mentioned. It was no nurse, it 
was no doctor, I mean nothing. I just laid, 
the same w ay, waiting, until they dump me ou
t right there on the fl
oor with the dead. 
Why and wh at [indecipherable] behind my  
understanding, and how to tell, how to 
explain, I did got over it. I did survive. 

Q: When  you were close to death befo
re, and your two friends saved you -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- your friends from Auschwitz. Was ther
e anybody who could assist you at this 
time in the hospital, and ke
ep  you going [indecipherable] 
A: No, I never saw them any more. I mean, th
ey came. I -- later I heard about it, that 
they -- they lived in Munich, 
around, they  -- they did a lo
t of business like -- lik e now, 
whatever, they™ve been 
fairly wealthy. They made mone
y already, but I never did. I -- 
I don™t know. To be honest, I was too naïve, 
or too spoiled. I didn™t -- if you have been 
from a family, a needy family, and been poor, 
actually, you had ambitious to go try to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
35
make some  money, to have a nicer life. 
But us, I know it, it went from generation to  
generation, the kids get older, the parents 
are tired, and you know, you take over. And 
I didn™t realize, you know, that
 you have to wo rk, even , for a living. I -- I thought it -- 
it comes au tomatically , like this -- and special when I saw what 
had happened to our 

family, and to our wealth, and to our mone
y, I practically hated money, and I didn™t 
want to have no part of it. I was not sm
art enough. And later, when I came to the 
United States, I regretted it, 
I saw it, I made a mistake. 
Q: We™ll get to that, but when
 you -- when you were close 
to death in Theresienstadt, 
there were -- really, you just recovered on your own. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You became able to  eat. There was no frie
nd to help you, or 
to keep you going? 
A: There™s nothing what you could help it. 
Ov er there was like I me ntioned it, it was 
strictly a matter of waiting until actually y
ou disappeared, you know
, you -- you died.  
Q: Or, as in your case, 
you slowly gain strength. 
A: In my  case, I don™t know how you -- I do
n™t know why, I just didn™t drop dead. 
Q: What kept you going, do 
you think? You mu st have th
ought a lot about th is during 
all -- 

A: To be honest -- to be honest, and 
I ha -- I was asked qu-questions, the same 
questions which you ask me right
 now. As far as I can recall, I try a lot of the time to 
recall things from home, the normal things, 
until I was arrested, until I -- I came to 
Auschwitz, and I could never figure out, and 
I don™t think I did ever actually fight for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
36
my  life. And actually what I had experience
d, after I was liberated , I suffered more 
when I was liberated, and -- and I -- I am aliv
e, than being actually in Auschwitz, and 
working in the coal 
mi ne. Because over there you didn™t -- you didn™t think about 
nothing else. 
Q: What did that feel like? You™ve mentione
d that before, that feeling, the realization 
that you™d su rvived, and that you™d lost ev
eryone else. I don™t know whether it™s guilt, 

or coming to  terms with it? 

A: Very, very bad. Very ba
d. I have always questioned 
why me. I have brothers, an 
other one have been mu ch nicer in anything
, you know, with feeli
ngs, or poor people, 
whatever, and I, to be honest with you, I 
was not as smart as my  brothers, you know, 
with feelings. And this bothered me
, questioned me, why did I survive? 
Q: Did you come to terms with
 that in any way, sort of 
feeling, well it -- I™m -- I™m 
here, and can tell the story, or -- 

A: No, no. No, in fact, when
 I worked, I worked here in
 the same co mpany since I 
came here to the States, and I worked 38 
years, and -- and -- in the office is 
management, was a lot of Jews, but in the factory wh ere I worked  actually, was very 

few Jews, and later when I -- in the beginni
ng I couldn™t speak English, but actually it 
was maybe a favor for me. But later used to
 come people who kno
w it a little bit about 
the Holocaust, and the concentration camps, th
ey used to ask me if I was mistreated, or 
if I didn™t had enough food. And I always to
ld them no, and the reason was simple. It™s 
in mine character, this actually how I was 
raised. I hate to see that somebody has 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
37
sympathy for me. I rather see 
somebody will help me, and ha
ve physical feelings, than 
somebody will tell me he has sy
mpathy for me because I su
ffered. This I cannot take. 
Pains I can take it, but not this sympathy, no. 
Q: Now, you spoke of Mr. Wolfe, who was 
the -- the boss, I think, of the company. 
A: Yeah, he was the 
boss, yeah, mist --  
Q: Is he still alive? 

A: He is alive. I know, more or less like fri
en ds. He treat me like 
in the family. On all 
occasions, Jewish holidays, if he makes anyt
hing for his family, we
 always on the list. 
In his home, or in a hotel, or whatever. In 
fact, when I got sick, he didn™t hear it from 
me -- I used to come visit the factory ever
y few weeks. He didn™t heard from me, he 
called home, he mentioned it right away, I kn
ow it™s not right. And finally I told him 
the story. Bu t i -- it cannot be a nicer person than Mr. Wolfe is. 
Q: We -- we should perhaps move forw
ard to that -- to 
that time when -- 
A: That™s all right. 
Q: -- would be 50 years ago, almost -- almost to the day. 
A: Yeah, it -- that™s rig h t, in October, I think the 26
th
 of October, 1949, I arrived in 
Germany, on a military  boat. The boat™s 
name was SS General Howe. It took us 16 
days from Bremen to touch the soil of the 
United States. And I remember when I was 
in Germany, I -- I worked -- I always -- I 
did -- I mentioned it. When  I got in touch 
that I found my  brother, he is in Israel
, and he kept on writi
ng me letter, don™t do 
foolish things, don™t play the black market. 
Don™t do nothing, cause it™s not legal, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
38
warned me. He says, ﬁYou come here, you 
going to have everything. You don™t have 
to wo rry now, think about nothing. You co
me here.ﬂ And finally, I was prepared, 
actually. I bought things -- necessary things, 
because in Germany I 
w o rk ed  fo r th e ira -
- UNRRA. I always made 
fairly good money. 
Q: That™s the United 
Nations relief agency. 
A: Right, right. I made money, and I didn™t 
made money, you know, just to have extra 
money. I made real nice, and I bought up -- if
 I go to Israel, to be established there, 

have things necessary, electrical things, or 
whatever. And I had, I think, three cases, 
three large cases already nailed up to go along,
 and I was, the last year actually, in ™48 
-- before I was in a sanatorium, in Dagaloff, th
is is the outsk irts of Stuttgart, a very 
beautiful place, but later they liquidated this
 camp, and the Stuttgart was a camp in the 
Reinspookstrasser, which is famous. I have 
a book they actually
 gave it to me, you 
know, the whole thing, the activities, what
 it was, in sh -- Reinspookstrasser. A nd 
there have been respectable people, a
nd because the other [indecipherable] was 
liquidated, so they called me, and they ask me
 if I want to take over food supply, and 
to be in charge like a chef, 
they call it a boss, over there 
on the Reinspookstrasser. I -- I 
didn™t know, you know, to deal
 in black market, but I know 
it that I have to ha -- get a 
job. So I accepted it, and I was very respecte
d by them, and they tried to do anything, 
whatever possible, to satisfy me. I was [i
ndecipherable] alone. Finally it happened one 
Sunday. I was not working, but I came -- I us
ed to live -- I lived still in Dagaloff, and I 
came down to the Reinspookstrasser, but this
 was the DP camp in Stuttgart, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
39
notice what I didn™t like. I noticed that they 
-- they have over ther
e, in every DP camp, 
they have their own police. It was Jewish 
policemen, what been -- like you had a job, 
whatever it was necessary to keep 
everything in orde
r. And they -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg. This is tape number two, side B. 
A: They used to take boys 
from 18 years, even mine age. I was at this time 26 year, 25 
-- 26 years old, and they  used to  l-like rou
nd th em up, get them, they put them in a 

room like a -- in a jail mo re or less, took 
them away, and the next day trucks from the 

Jewish brigade come, and they  took you to  
Bremen, whatever, to send them to Israel. 

And this I didn™t like it. 
Q: Oh, they were involuntary? 
A: Involuntary, exactly. Involuntarily. 

Q: And I -- didn™t know this went on, so -- 
A: And when I saw this, it reminded me too mu ch of it.  
Q: They were in fact giving
 them a good life, and these 
were displaced persons, but 
why -- 
A: No [indecipherable] 
Q: But why did they do it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
40
A: -- they have been told. From the -- you 
know, from the Israeli government, whoever 
was, you know, that this is the only way to
 get the young people
 away from the black 
market, you know, just to bring them to Isra
el, they needed soldiers, I -- I don™t know 
why. But when this -- I saw it then on the spot
, I said, ﬁForce, that™s -- it™s out of the 
question.ﬂ And then I tried to think -- I almo
st was ready to leave to go to Israel, and 
then I came -- you know, when  you think abou
t this, come to you other things. And I 
know it that my  brother is not a ha -- a we
althy person, he worked
 for the government, 
he had a good job, a high position, everyt
hing, but far from saying, you know, he™s 
able, yes, like he wrote in the letters
, you don™t worry, you™ll be taken care of, 
everything. And in -- they had already at this
 time, they had a boy maybe four or five 
years old. He was born in ™40, actually he 
was six year -- no, older than this, seven, 
eight years, right? Yeah, he was born in ™40.
 And -- and they keep  
on th -- my thinking 
-- yeah, I said, ﬁIf I will come over there, yo
u hadn™t bought even  a bed already, where 
I gonna sleep?ﬂ He said he gonna take away 
from his wife, and his kid, you know, and 
try to give it to me. And I said no, 
this will not work. I™m not the type.  
Q: Did you at the same time long to be w
ith him, since you™d lost all your family? 
A: In one way, yes, in the other way I was 
afraid he gonna think that he owns his life 
for me. I got scared, I said there™s no way 
in the world, it will not work. And then I 
figured another thing. If I come to Israel, 
and Israel was a lot like my brother from my 
home town, what that lived 
over there, so they knowe
d me, and they knowed the 
family. And I figured , you know
, I was not -- I didn™t had no 
trades. I was not educated 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
41
practically, nothing. And I said wh atever I 
going to do, you know
, you should be -- 
and especially you come from 
a small town like me, that th
is job is suitable for you, 
this is your -- if in a too 
good home, to take a job, you
 know, like cleaning, I don™t 
know streets, or other thing. I said, the be
st thing is maybe to go to the United States, 
nobody knows me, I don™t have 
no relatives, and I don™t [i
ndecipherable] this to be 
over there. 

Q: But that was scary, too. 

A: And how. This was more scary, and what
 more was thinking -- 
I thought to myself, 
what will I do over there? I cannot speak a wo
rd of English. I don™t have no trade. 
Yeah, what? Again go for charities -- you know, Jewish orga
nizations to support? I 
said, I™m n o t the type for it. I -- h o w can I 
do it? But I had a friend, he left in ™46 
already. He wa -- I was with him in Buch
enwald down in Tray
litz, actually, and he 
survived. He -- 

Q: And what was his name? 

A: Bernard Fedderman. I was with him in Tr
aylitz all the time. In 
fact, later even in 
Theresienstadt, when survived
, and then he came to Stu
ttgart also, and Dagaloff, and 
then we used to live togethe
r. He -- he wrote me -- he was constantly in contact with 
me. We w -- we have been actually -- we had a room, both of us together. So he 
already had a kid, a first kid was born. You 
-- he -- he left, she was pregnant. He had 
had already a kid. And he was a bookbi
nder here, because his parents had a 

bookbinder shop in Leipzig. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
42
Q: He -- when di -- when 
did he marry in Europe? 
A: Oh, he married in Stuttgart,
 actually, I was his witness, actually. His best -- we have 
been the closest friend, actually. You know,
 we both su
rvived the impossible. He 
married in ™45. I remember
 a chaplain in the army 
and everything. And just 
[indecipherable] called th
e name [indecipherable] 
Q: Did he -- did he marry a survivor?  
A: Yeah. Yeah, he married a su
rvivor. In fact, he ask me -- 
he is a very naïve person, 
honest, naïve -- I -- to compare, was a crook.
 Things that he did a little bit here and 
there, I was -- he send me, you know, he woul
dn™t do it, the things. He was something 
[indecipherable]. And so he -- he ask me what
 I think, if he shou
ld marry her. When I 
okayed, th is when he married her. He ha
d a ver -- very naïve person. Very nice, 

decent, person. Really, it™s hard
 to find a person like him. 
Q: Now, in that time, immediately  after li
beration, and during the time people spent in 
displaced person™s ca-camps, 
many marriages took place. 

A: Right, right. 
Q: It was very natural. But you were unusua
l in -- perhap s because you were shy, in 
waiting a wh ile? Or you just had not met the right person? 
A: It™s a -- okay, I had -- this I answer fo
r you -- can answer in -- really nice, and I 
answer for you with honesty what it was. I 
come from a good home, and to be honest, 
a lot of maybe special survivors who su rvived
 will not like it. But I didn™t do nothing, I 

didn™t made money in Germany, and if 
any girl from a better 
home, you know, was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
43
plenty boys who had a lot of money and 
everything. They bought them clothing, 
jewelry. They took practically
 the -- the best of the crop, 
you know? Just to tell you in 
plain wo rds. I was falling behind, and b
ecause I was raised, and how it was, and I 
didn™t want the -- to go a 
little bit too deep in, you know
, where -- where normally -- in 
normal circumstances, I would never be associ
ate, so I hold myself back. This is the 
reason, you know, I was not married, actually
. I didn™t look. If a Jewish girl what I 
actually -- she came from a better home a little b
it, you know, like me, I didn™t look for 
nothing more. She had the better offers 
than me, you know, financially speaking. 
Q: Do you think, too, that 
you wanted to begin to rebuild
 your life before you settled 
down, was that part of it? 
A: I -- to be honest, I didn™t know it, what 
to do, what not to do
, where to go, where I 
will not go. 
Q: It was just what happened . 
A: Yeah. One thing, actually, I was scared 
about America, wh-what will I do. But my 
friend Bernard Fedderman, he kept -- I mean
 we -- we lived together for over a -- he 
left in ™46, in beginning. We lived toge
ther, actually, for a whole year, so we know 
each other very well, and he know that I™m 
not a lazy type, you know, I™m willing to 
do anything. And I will learn anything, alth
ough he kept on writi
ng me, you don™t have 
to be afraid for the United States. If you 
have [indecipherable], if you come here, if 
you want to work , you can al
ways find wo rk . So he in -- is the one who en courag ed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061

me to come, and I think this actually whyI did come, actually, his [indecipherab le] 
encouragement, yeah. 
Q: And did he help you wh en you 
were here? Was he in this area? 
A: I came -- I was sponsper -- sponsored from the HIAS in Baltimore, and actu ally 

when I came to the States, right away 
somebody, you know, from the HIAS, they 
waited for us with the boat wh
en  we landed, then they  took us on trains, and they  
shipped us -- and the train embarked us in
 Baltimore. I h ad been
 in Baltimore, and it 
was, for me, you know, special where I was --
 I was living in Dagaloff, the outskirts of 
Stuttgart. And, you know, I was used to nice
, clean, life. And to me it felt -- Baltimore 
-- filthy, very bad. And I -- come to my
 mind I did make the biggest mistake. 
Q: And this -- in Baltimore yo
u were in the care of the -- 
A: Right, right. 
Q: -- immigration and naturalization service. 
A: Right -- I mean -- no, the 
HIAS, actually [indecipherable] 
Q: Oh. Explain what that is. 
A: The HIAS is a Jewish relief organization.
 They  took care of Jewish immigrants, no, 
and this had nothing to  do with  naturaliza
tion, only Jewish immigrant, if you didn™t 
had nobody to sponsor you, 
and so they sponsored, and th ey took the responsibility. 
And they  have been real, unusually nice, you 
know, when  we got off 
in the trains, they 
waited for us, and right away they took us 
to hotel, you know. Not the best, hi -- but 

still a hotel, and -- and they came every day,
 they ask you what 
you need, what you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
45
don™t need . And they  offered 
me, you know, you need clothi
ng? And I told them no, I 
don™t need  clothing, I have two suitcases, 
big suitcases. I have clothing, I had tailor 
made suits in Germany, over there. He sa
id, ﬁShoes?ﬂ And then
 he told me, ﬁOver 
here, you know, there™s a li -- clothing is 
a little bit different. Why don™t you -- you 
know, we give you money, go 
buy yourself.ﬂ I says, ﬁNo, I don™t need to buy, and I 
don™t take.ﬂ They  offered me s-schooling, 
I can go -- they know th at I don™t speak 
English, and so they said, ﬁH
ow about we gonna give you -- 
not in  the hotel, we gonna 
rent you a room in a house, you live over th ere in the house. We will pay all expensive 
-- all what you need, food and everything, 
we will pay. You go to school and learn 
English.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I don™t want to go to
 school. I -- I™m not educated, and I will not 
-- I will not -- not looking to get educated in
 the United States.ﬂ [indecipherable] what 
you wanted. I says, ﬁI want a job.ﬂ Well, they
 took me to several places here and th ere, 
and it didn™t worked  out. And a lot of places 
even the owner was Jewish, he said all his 
employees are non-Jews, and they  don™t think 
it will work out. And so di-didn™t get. 
They  kept on -- said oh you be pensh -- patie
nt, we take care of everything, you just 

stay over there. And I disliked everything
. Baltimore, and the du
 -- whatever they 
asked me, I refused to take it. 
Q: How long did -- 
A: I never took it, and I™m proud of it. 
Q: And how long did 
this period go on? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
46
A: This went on actually, like for two week
s. And then my friend, Fedderman, he was 
already established, they had one kid, a boy
, and all this. And he lived already in a 
house. He made fairly good money alrea
dy, you know, for me, I thought, you know, I-
I™d be a king if the -- if I be able to ma
ke as money -- mu ch money as him. And no -- 
he came over to Baltimore, and he realized 
that I am miserable, and he said, ﬁWhy 
don™t you come with me to Washington?ﬂ An
d he says, ﬁWe have a extra room.ﬂ They 
had a three bedroom house. He says, ﬁYou 
can live over there in the house with us, 
you eat with us, and every,ﬂ -- he say, 
ﬁuntil you get a job, 
and you have some 
money.ﬂ He say, ﬁYou can pay me later, what
ever you feel to pay me for -- fo r this,ﬂ 
to live over there. So actua
lly, I lived over there with th
em for more than a year, 
actually over a year. 

Q: And where was that? 
A: In Washington. 
Q: I was just wondering what part of the city, and -- 

A: Oh, he used to live -- the first h ouse wh
ere he had, th at he lived was on Sh epherd 
Street, northwest. Was not far from Georgia 
Avenue, Shepherd. Sh -- I think Shepherd, 
and let™s see, 12 - 13, maybe Seventh Street was Georgia Avenue. 
Around nine -- ninth 
s -- Ninth Street, north Shepherd , nine northwest. 
Q: A sort of tree lined streets, Washington neighborhood. 
A: Yeah, yeah, and I th ought he™s a king, 
you know. I would never expect, you know, 
that he has such nice life, you know, he marri
ed, and he has a kid, 
and he has a house, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
47
and he has a job. In the beginning, actually, 
he told me if I wanted, he said, ﬁYou don™t 
have to do nothing cause I tell you.ﬂ But if
 I wanted, he can tell -- take me where he 
was by this bookbinder. 
And he will ask him ahead of ti
me if he can bring in, you 
know, somebody, a helper, or 
-- I didn™t know nothing ab
out bo-bookbinding. And so 
he took me along where he worked, and th
e owner was Gentile. And he was a elderly 
person, probably  in the upper 70™s. But he 
was very, unusually nice, and friendly, and 
he showed me things to help arou
nd over there, all kind jobs, and -- 
Q: You were a nice looking young man in a very good suit. 
A: This -- this I don™t know. This I couldn
™t tell. But he was very, very pleased. 
Whatever he told me, I -- I tried to do it the 
best what a human can do, tried to please 
him. And he recognized this, and so he ri
ght away, he had the respect, you know, that 
I™m not just coming in. What had happen
ed  was over there a big [indecipherab le] 
actually he paid me well, like paid me ac tu ally in 1949, about a 
dollar an hour, what 
this was a -- a lot, actu ally, it was good 
money. Bu t it got slow. I couldn™t speak 
English, and I was over there a day, and so 
he told me to clean up the supply where 
they kept, and th is probably  was never clea
ned. So I really did a job wh at nobody 
would do, you know. [indeci
pherable] or not, I don™t know, it doesn™t make any 
difference, but nobody would do it, someth
ing like this. I took everything out, and 
dusted, an d I ate -- my  dust choked me, but 
I did it. And when  he came, it was clean. 
His face was smiling, he looked at me. Tha -- si -- comple -- he didn™t recognize even, 

but it was, I cleaned it out so. And it was on -- 
very slow other days. I told my friend, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
48
said, ﬁBernard, tell Mr. Gruver that I don™t wa
nt that he pays me if I don™t do no 
work.ﬂ If I don™t work, I don™t want it that 
he pays me money I didn™t deserve. Well, 
he went over, and told him, 
and he came  back, and he laug
hed and -- and he said, ﬁOh, 
don™t worry,ﬂ you know, ﬁyou™ll be slow anot
her day, it will be here plenty work for 
you, come and work .ﬂ I was over there maybe
 a whole week longer, and it didn™t come 
in too much work, and I was 
still doing nothing practically, 
here and there something. 
So I told  him I don™t want him that he pays 
me if I didn™t work  for it. And I left. And 
then I went to the Jewish social organizatio
n, actually they used
 to be not far away 
from Shepherd Street, even over 
there. I forgot the street, but it was pretty close. And I 
told them I want a -- a job. So they 
called up the American Wholesale where Mr. 
Wolfe is. He was -- at this time, his brother-i
n-law -- he married to the family from the 

owners. His name was Krepshaw, David Kr
epshaw. And he called up th em if they 
have an opening, and they told  him yes. They
 told me how to get there, and whatever. 
So I went over there, they 
used to be located on Rhode 
Island Av enue, Fourth Street. 
And I went over there, and they  had somebody,
 an American who is Polish descent, so 
he -- he translated here, because I didn™t -- 
couldn™t speak a word of English. So right 
away, the -- the same way, 
wh atever I did, I tried to do my  best because some body 
would tell me to move a house, and it wouldn™
t be hard fo r me, I would probably  move 
it. I did my best, and they had recognition. 
They saw it was right. They start rig h t away 
to advance me. They to
ld me that I will be a foreman,
 a working foreman, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
49
will learn me cutting. Course, it™s a mattress 
company, you know, Serta, and they will 
learn me to  be a cutter. It sound to me all right. 
Q: Cutting metal? 

A: No, mattress fabrics. 

Q: I see. 
A: For mattresses, covers. 
Q: Oh, yes. 

A: I was, and th ey assigned me the sewing ro
om, what mo st of them have been  wo men 
actually, worked over there. Well, they learned me do the cu
tting, and they told me all 
the -- they start me off with 
75 cents an hour. You know, he told me that s -- 75 he 
does only because I™m in a concentration cam
p, you know, a refuge
e. Because he pays 
-- he start o ff the people normally, with 50 cen
ts an hour. So he gave me 75, and -- and 
from time to time he told me -- he came over th
ere, they liked it, what I did, whatever. 
And he gave me like full charge, he says, 
ﬁYou can wo rk overtime in the evening. You 
want stay, stay as long as you want. I™m goi
ng to have one and a half, you know. And 
if you want come in Saturd
ay to clean up the place, so
 you come in Saturday, and 
clean up the place.ﬂ And I really cleaned, re
ally, not like these other people. And I 
made myself [indecipherable] 
even at 75 cents, by p-putting in ex tra hours. Every day 
an hour, and Saturd ay five, six hours. It wa
s alright, but I never figured anyway that I 
will stay in a factory. It was a little bit out
 of my line, I would never use, you know, a 
brain thing, and I have to wo rk for somebo
dy. But what can you do? I -- I couldn™t do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
50
nothing better, either, so I ke
pt on staying here, but they ke
pt on raising always a little 
bit here, a little bit there, 
this holiday. And [indecipherabl
e] I figured I start from the 
beginning, start again from the bottom, I don™t 
know, so I -- I tried to stay with them. 
And I stayed with them un
til actually -- took a little w h ile, and they made me a 
supervisor over there, the -- 
the sewing room was under my  charge comp letely. And 
they let me do anything that I wanted to 
do, you know, and well, 
this made me feel 
better, too.  
Q: So you were in -- supe
rv ising a number of other people as time went by? 
A: Yeah, about 25
 people, yeah. Men and wo men. 
Q: A fairly responsib le job. 

A: It™s not easy. But I know it, you know, 
if you have to do it,
 it doesn™t make any 
different.  
Q: And is that where you s -- you spent 
your w -- your career, with that same 
company? 
A: Yeah,  I retired after 38 years, 38 years 
I was with the compan
y, never worked for 
nobody else, except a coup
le weeks in the bookbindi
ng sh op wh ere my  friend 
Fedderman worked. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Mm. 
Q: It™s quite a story, really. They were -- 
they were lucky to have you, and I™m sure 
you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
51
A: Yeah, they have been  very  pleased, espe
cially Mr. Wolfe was at
 this time, like a 
manager in the division, they had other divisi
ons, too. They  used to  have appliances 
distributors. 

Q: And with  the group -- the area you were
 with, that was called American Mattress? 
A: Wholesaler. 
Q: Oh, I see, American Wholesale Company. 
A: Yeah, yeah, American Wholesaler, becaus
e they have several divisions in -- well, 

the management was pretty smart, very, very
 smart, because if one division didn™t do 
busin ess, then the other division cove
red. And this was very well organized. 
Q: And your -- your comfort in En
glish just developed over time? 

A: I used to go to the Americanization schoo
l, nights, over there, and in the beginning 
I thought I will never learn. But you know, 
I always used public transportation, like I 
used to go with streetcar to 
work , and back, and always pe
ople tried [indecipherable] 
say it, and I used to tell them I can not speak 
mu ch English, what it all, it™s true, oh and 
they made me comp liments, oh you sp eak so
 good, so nice. I -- I know this was a 
comp liment, this was not the truth. Bu
t eventually, it took a few months, then 
suddenly, you know, wh
at more I tried to talk English, the more I realized I -- it 
comes. You have just to be patient. 
Q: And you moved out of y
our -- your room in Bernard Fedderman™s home in time? 
A: Yeah, they bought another home, and it wa
s a little bit smaller. So I moved out, I 
did appreciate, you know, I stay
ed with him this time, and meanwhile, I got involved, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
52
you know, I had my wife, she™s actually fro
m Stuttgart. And she was like a girlfriend, 
but we always have been in 
contact with each other, we all glad to see each other. 
Q: You met at a -- at a -- at a bus stop. Is that right, in 19 -- 
A: Yeah, yeah
, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- w-would that have 
been in 1940 -- ™46? 
A: Six, yeah, in 1946 I met her. You kn
ow, I was lonesome. Nothing even -- you 
know, I had a job what I was pleased, I was 
the chef in the supp
lies, and everything, 
but I still was alone, you know. I di -- didn™t
 had no relatives. I didn™t have nobody, 
just some boys, you know from the concentra
tion camp, we used to be friends, this 
was all. And when I met her, actually, she wa
s a -- more than just
 a g -- really good 
looking girl. 

Q: Actually, tell me -- tell me  that -- your 
wife™s full name, and mo re about her fami ly 
background. 

A: Her full name is Herta, and her birth name is Nagel, N-a-g-e-l. And -- I mean, I 

didn™t know it actually, until went a little bit 
longer. We had a date here, and there, and 
then she invited me to her home, and ri
ght away her mother 
was paralyze -- par-
paralyzed, she had a stroke. Bu t, win -- wo nd
erful people, real nice. Her father was 
very much involve 
anti-Nazi. He was picked up, e-even
 was jailed, he almost went to 
Dachau, the same  way, for talking, yo
u know. If you talk there too mu ch -- 

Q: And were they a -- were they a Jewish family? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
53
Q: Oh. I had assumed they were
. So this is interesting. 
A: No, no, no, isn™t a Jew, but very decent 
people. And I come over there, I felt a little 
bit, you know, wh at I was missing. A home, mo
re or less. And in fact, she used to take 
care like even my  shirts, underw ear, whateve
r, she took it home, and washed it, and 
they pressed it, and brought 
it back. They got the touch. 
Q: Tell me what they felt like, because yo
u would be so desperately alone, I would 
think. 
A: Oh yeah, I was very desperately alone, 
no doubt about it. And wh en I was here, in 
the beginning I came -- I used to go to  the 
Jewish community  center, and I used to 
meet the Jewish girls, too. And I went ou
t with them here and there. Was one time I 
remember I went out with a Jewish girl 
-- no -- yeah, it was in the Jewish community 
center. And we talked, and talked, and you 
know, it™s almost was time to leave the 
center, and she asked -- she ask me, ﬁWhere™s 
you car?ﬂ And this right away  gave me 
a pretty bad feeling, an impression. 
I was happy I had to  pay a token, not 
[indecipherable] a car. And I di
dn™t felt right, actually. And li --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg. This is tape number thre
e, side A. Continue to tell me the story 
of your meeting your wife, and your marriage. 
A: Oh, well actually, I kept on -- have more
 feelings from time to time. When I left 
Germany, actually, I figured I don™t want to
 take responsibility 
to be married over 
there, bring here somebody, 
you know, because I didn™t know to  -- how -- even  being 
alone, how I will be able to get along. But 
later, I felt that I™m
 missing, actually, I 
missed her very much, to a great extent. A
nd the beginning actually
, they said in the 
Americanization school, they used to help me, the principal over there, he ask me, you 

know it, and I told him I have over there a gi
rlfriend, she™s in Germ
any. So he used to 
write to the consul about it, and especially 
Cy Wolfe actually, he wrote letters to the 
consul too. And she ha -- was registered al
ready, you know, she 
had a uncle here in 
Long Island that she wanted 
to co -- times were bad in 
-- in Germany, wa -- so she 
wanted to come here, so finally with the 
help and Cy Wolfe, we
ll, sh e had a chance. 
She came two years later. When
 she came here, she had -- right away she got a job, 
and she made more mon -- better than me. Sh
e worked in the Hous
e office building.  
Q: You -- that was -- she would in
 fact herself be -- being so brave to make that trip, to 
start a new life. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
55
A: Oh, sure. You know, she had a -- her fath
er was a older -- I mean, elderly person. 
You know [indecipherable] stayed 
because th ey have to take care of their parents. Her 
mo ther was paralyzed, and ev erything. 
Q: Did she have brothers 
or sisters? Did she have brothers or sisters? 
A: Yeah, she had one sister, and she was 18
 years older than her, you know, she had a 
-- one sister. But in the begi
nning th ey didn™t like it that 
she leaves, but eventually -- 
you know, her mother knowed me, and ev
erything, and she th ought with somebody 
else that sh e wouldn™t know it, she wouldn
™t let her go. But because she knowed me, 
so she agreed, you k
now, that she can go. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did either you, or your wife™s
 family have any rese
rvations because you 
were -- she was Gentile, and you were Jewish? 

A: I wrote this to mine brother, and -- about 
it, and he answered me, he said in -- you 
know, we are from a strict Orthodox family, he
 wrote me this letter, as much suffering 
I had to go through, I can do
 whatever I feel, he feels, you know, that it will be 
justified [indecipherable]. And th en wh en 
she came here, actually, I got in touch -- 
what do they  call them? The -- the He
brew congreg at -- you know, the Reform 
synagogue, actually. And I met over there sh
 -- he was assistant rab b i, Rabbi Schiff, I 
don™t know if he™s still alive. He was teachi
ng in the -- I think Harvard School, too, as 
a professor, you know, a nice person, he 
was from Germany. And I met him, and 
Rabbi Gerstenfeld too, you know, he was th
e main rabbi. And Rabbi Schiff married us, 
actually, in there.

Q: 1951. 
A: ™52, I think. 
Q: Oh, ™52. 

A: Yeah, ™52 [inaudible]. She came in ™51. 

Q: And you™d corresponde
d during that time? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, constan
tly, you know. We write [inde
cipherable] she right away, 
second week she came, she we
nt, took a job, actually. 
Q: And did she speak any 
English when she came? 
A: No, but she did all this -- a -- a lot of -- 
she did typing, and typing actually, this for 
her -- she was trained in Germany. In Germa
ny, actually, if you are trained, you know 
what you are doing, too. 

Q: They are really good training. 
A: It™s not here. And [indecipherable] resp
ected her work, actually, he liked it very 
much. And she had a chance, 
because she typed the whole day, wh ich she learned 
[indecipherable] comi ng home, you know, 
watch TV. Yeah, she didn™t go to th e 
Amer-Ame ricanization school, I did. 
Q: Yeah, and by then, you we 
-- you were speaking English -- 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: -- the language -- 
A: Yeah. I don™t speak good Englis
h today, but I still am speaking.  
Q: Tell me more about the 
things that you an d your wife shared in co mmon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
57
A: Oh, in  the beginning was pretty hard  lif
e. I mean, we didn™t had nothing, but we 
didn™t felt, you know, that 
it will not be hard. We both sh
ared. She was working, and I 
was work ing, and tried to save. And th e reas
on fo r saving was not so mu ch that I liked 
to save to get -- to put a lot of things was 
I wanted, and fe -- and have feelings that I 
cannot afford to satisfy this, 
but I know it can come a time 
when are -- you are not able 
any more to do work, whatev
er it is, and you fall -- want 
to fall a burden or nothing. 
But this was mine strongest po
int for the -- that it is nece
ssary to save. When the time 
comes that I cannot affo rd, that
 my health does not allow me
, that I still have to look 
for my savings to su pport me. And we actuall
y, this way, thanks God with savings, we 
got adjusted to a nice life, not to waste, or
 not what -- what it was necessary. So we did 
some saving. And I™m proud to say, actua
lly, that since I was 
involved with the 

Holocaust museum, and I was -- I felt that th
e museum is a great institution for -- not 
only for surv ivors, but for human -- humanity
, for everyone. And I never dreamed that 
I will -- we will be able to 
afford to contribute, but th
anks God we 
did contribute 
hundred thousand dollars to the Holocaust mu
seum. This, at least, makes me  proud of 
myself. 

Q: That™s -- I didn™t know that, and th
at™s really quite wonderful that you -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that you -- that you could. Cause I can think of -- [indecipherab le] I -- I really 
think that is -- think the museum 
performs this wonderful role -- 
A: I think so , too. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
58
Q: -- of making sure it 
won™t happen ag ain.  
A: I think it™s the best institution, actually
. It™s a safeguard for the next generations. 
Q: Yes. Now, both you and your wife, a
lthough you had different
 faiths that you™ve 
grown up in, probably -- 
A: Yes, she has -- she actually accep
ted the Jewish faith, actually.  
Q: Yeah -- no, I meant that your -- your ch
ildhood would have been  spent in different 
faiths, but you would -- you would ha -- afte
r your marriage, you™ve shared the same 
faith, and also a -- probably both of you ha
d known some degree of hardship . Even 
your wife had experienced the war. So 
probably your values were similar. 
A: She was very cooperative,
 actually. She had feelings, 
you know, to follow my self, 
so we never had any co mp lications. Even  we
 have not been the same faith, in the 
beginning, but she accepted to follow me. 
Q: Yeah. I™m -- I™m asking these questions
, too, knowing that a great many of the 
survivors with experiences so
mething like yours, perh aps for shorter periods, tended to  
marry survivors. And that™s really 
why I™m probing with
 these questions. 
A: Right. Yeah, this is true, but like I men
tioned, actually, I had bad experience when  I 
had a friend to me what -- she was devoted  to
 me, and this -- and I miss her very much, 
so this makes a strong friendship, and this
 why actually I was waiting until she had a 
chance to come over here, and 
to share a life together, that we do share, because we 
have been married in ™
52. It™s actually 47 years actually  are married. 
Q: Yeah. No w did you -- you don™t 
have children, is that right?

A: Unfortunately, my wife was one time pre
gnant, but we didn™t have the experience, 
you know, how to be careful, 
whatever, in the pregnancy. Sh e had a miscarriage, and it 
upset us both, but in  the other hand, it didn™t
 change our life, either, actually. I always 
figured, if something doesn™t go our way, we
 have to accept it, because we never look 
-- she was trying to get medical help, and 
ev erything, but it didn™
t succeed, and so 
finally we gave it up, to take it as it comes.  

Q: Mm-hm. I ask that only be
cause I -- I understand some survivors have, because of 
their suffering, not wanted to
 have children, and you don™t seem to be one of those 
people who -- 

A: No, it was not our intention. We wanted, 
actually, very bad. In the beginning, the 
first years, we couldn™t afford
 to have it. We didn™t feel, well if we gonna bring in a 
life, and we have hard ship to su rviv e, but 
we always figured, when the time get better, 
we save a little bit more, then we start it. 
And then we started, and it was too late, or 
whatever it is, it just did not materialize. 

Q: Mm-hm. Tell me about reli -- what your 
religion means to you, and do you go to  
synagogue regularly? 

A: About religion, as I mentioned before, I 
was raised Orthodox, and I always felt in 
my heart that the Jewish religion is the only 
practically religion, that you can believe in 
it, it has a ground to -- to believe in it. I 
-- b-but I respect any religion. I respect any 
person who can hold up his custom, his religi
on, I respect very much. I am right -- no I 
am not a particular -- I wouldn™t call myse
lf I™m a religious person, but I am very

traditional. In the past I remember the nice 
holidays, [indecipherabl
e] and other things, 
in a clean, nice life. A nd I still try, you know, 
to resume those things
. And to be honest 
[indecipherable] I was asked by kids in th
e school, and I lecture to them about the 
Holo caust, and they  ask me if I believe in Go
d. To answer this, it™
s very hard. In one 
way, it™s pretty hard to believe, if -- 
Q: I interrupted. You were telling me about 
the children asking do you believe in God. 
A: Yes. To answer you straight, what -- what
 the Jewish people -- nation, suffered, it™s 
actually hard to believe in God, but I take
 mine whole strength in to believe, and I™m 

not so highly  educated to be
 able to say that -- to believe, or not to believe, though I 
acc -- I accept that the easiest thing actua
lly to believe, and 
continue believing. 
Q: And you followed all the tr
aditions? They™re part of y
our -- of your marriage and 
your life?  

A: More or less. To tell the truth, more or
 less I follow it, and I enjoy it, but we don™t 
run constantly to the synagogue, but on 
the high holidays, we always attend the 
services. 

Q: Mm-hm. What about friendships in your 
life? You spoke of different ones during 
the years when you were in 
camp s. Have th -- have your friendships been enormously  
important? 

A: Oh su re, it™s important, actually, when -- 
I cannot lie, because I don™t have nobody 
left. And so friendship is actually the most what
 we still have left over. I continue to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
61
in friendly terms with old friends [indecipher
ab le] around here. I feel I™m blessed that 
we have friends. 
Q: In the early years -- 

A: Excuse me. 

Q: Yeah, in -- in the -- in your first years 
in this country , were you -- was your social 
group very mu ch a group of survivors? 

A: More or less, yes, but we have a -- a 
lot of friends, you know, they ™re not been 
survivors, and a lot of Gentile
 families, what are very nice
 people, and decent people, 
and we enjoy very much to sp
end time with them together.  
Q: I was -- in -- in thinking about how you
, I think, managed to -- to endure those 
years of suffering, of extreme brutality and so
 on, and yet to come out of it and be able 
to be a sort of loving, warm person, I™m
 guessing -- I -- I™d like you to -- to tell me 
whether you™ve thought about how you we
re able to do that? Was it the -- the 

upbringing you had? The fri
endships? I -- I mean, there 
mu st be things that you 
thought of. 
A: As far as I know -- it™s a very good questi
on, but fo r me it™s actu
ally easy to answer 
it. They are up there, I think, my whole fami
ly, all brothers and sisters, how we have 
been raised by our parents. 
My parents, especially my father was very strict in 
behaving, but I™m really thankful for his -- that
 he raised us in a strict way, that I can 
have the -- to understand, and to  know th
e difference between go
od and bad. And we 
have been raised -- and I think all my  brothe
rs know in our family, have been mo re or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
62
less actually, raised the right way, and to 
respect where we suppose
d to respect. And I 
feel that I was blessed w
ith a family like this.  
Q: I asked that question, too, knowing 
that many -- ma ny su rvivors have found it 
difficult to adjust to -- to life because of ho
w much they suffered. 
Others too, have had 
full and rounded s -- remarkably successful
 lives, but do you th
ink th at you often 
suffer because of your earlier suffering? I wa
s thinking about, does it show up in great 
anxiety, about your wife, for instance? If 
she™s late comi ng home, do you feel, do you 
think, mo re concerned than somebody 
else mi ght be? Are you mo re anxious? 
A: It™s no doubt any survivor, I don™t care 
who it is, who had to 
go through so much 
humiliation, and suffering, and taking away th
e dignity from being a human being, if 
we want it, or we don™t want it, something 
is missing in us, and -- and I mean not in 
my self, but in any su rvivor. And this can neve
r be fulfilled, even if
 you are successful 
in business, and family life, and everything
, always will come to haunt you about your 

past, about your suffering. But 
in other hand, I accept it, the 
philosophy, if I want it, I 
don™t want it, I have to go on with my  life,
 either way. If I think too mu ch about my  
past, and those all good things what I lost, is 
the only way to bury 
myself alive, not to 
know. But the -- so long
 I keep on continuing with my  lif
e, I have to be strong enough 
to take life and accept life as it co mes. 

Q: Do you find that in the -- decades a
go, in the early years, that you had to 
deliberately block out those thou
ghts, and -- and lo ok to your futu re in order to cope? I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
63
ask that question because I know
 that you™ve given interviews
 like this in latter years, 
but not -- not earlier.  
A: The same thing, actually. As much that
 I rememb er those old horror stories, and 
they can never be told, but not a human bei
ng, I -- but my past from the suffering, but I 
have always thinking, not of
 a great deal about future success, but accept life how it 
comes. And I think this holds me going th e way how I do.  

Q: I wonder if when you and yo
ur wife were first togethe
r, would you tell her at great 
length of -- of what had happene
d during those earlier years? 
A: Yeah, with my wife, I always discussed, 
and I always used to tell her. And she was 
trying to  protect me, like for example when 
it used to come the worst horror stories, 
and documentary on TV, she was trying, a
nd not succeeded that 
I shouldn™t watch it. 
But for some reason, I tried never to miss 
nothing. And to be hon
est, when people -- 
strange people, or friends even, who were 
not -- had those horrible experience from 
being in a concen tration camp, I watched them
 constantly, and -- and mo st of the time, 
I don™t know why, this is actually, it™s a si
ckness, I hardly was moved by it. I felt I™m 
more like a piece metal, a stone
. But now in -- nothing ca -- 
can move me, actu ally to 
those old, horrible memories from the past.  
Q: Do you think that™s because that™s 
how you coped th en, by -- by -- by becoming 
numb? 

A: I accepted that I cannot choose my life --
 things what is coming to what is not 
coming. I lost everything, the best and th
e dearest. I lost everything. And then  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
64
actually ma de up my  mind, and realized that
 this is only a way not to complain, and 
not to th ink too mu ch ab out it, but you cannot 
forget, but to keep on  going, as long as 
possible with my  life I had,
 and take it as it comes. 
Q: Have you, in your -- your 50 years now
 in America, are there been -- are there 
particular causes, and interests that you™ve
 had? You™ve told 
me how you supported 
the Holocaust museum, that 
would be more recently, but are there other political or 
social things that are 
dear to your heart? 
A: No, I never was a political person, and I realize, you know, even  if you want get 
involved , you cannot change. Yo u have to 
accept how it comes, and I didn™t have no 
problem, actually, in accepting, and behavi
ng myself, actually, to
 be a good citizen, 
and to obey all rules, w h atever a citizen 
should obey. I -- I cannot give you much  more 
about this, than those things. I try to be th
e right way. See a lot of things -- in every 
country, and the United States is not an ex
ception, it™s good things
, and bad th ings, but 
you still have to obey, as a good citizen, the law of in the land. 

Q: When  you came here, did you 
experience any discrimination? 
A: Sure, I felt discrimination. I remember in
 1953, wh en we had be
en married -- or in 
™52, and at this time went out to  get an ap
artment. We lived in a furnished room, we 
lived in [indecipherable] an ap
artment, so finally we decide
d that we -- we going to get 
an apartment, buy our own furn iture, establ
ish our own. And the first experience was 
we looked at an apartment, and we lik
ed it over there, and when  I made an 
appointment with the lady, th
e owner, and I came in, and she asked me questions, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
65
she realized that I am Jewish, and I™m not
 an American, cause 
I couldn™t speak good 
English yet, and actually she refused to rent
 it me. But this didn™t discourag e me, and I 
was not mad. I felt this is her apartment, sh
e -- and she has hundred percent, full right, 
to choose to whom she rented, yes or no, I 
never -- I -- I didn™t feel I was discriminated 
because she didn™t want to 
rent me the apartment. 
Q: But of course, that™s one thing 
that would have changed today.  
A: I da -- I don™t think it will change. You ca
nnot force nobody to
 love you, to like 
you, or to  do wh atever. Some people have 
their own way, and I fe
el they have their 
right to do th eir own judgment, and even  w
ithout in-interference from a government or 
force you to  rent to the person even if you 
don™t like it. I feel this what a free country 
should be. If you are the owner of it, you ha
ve any right to choos
e who want to rent 
your apartment, and not be told by the la
w -- you know, but the government, he has to 
-- you have to rent them. If he doesn™t wa
nt it, there™s plenty
 other apartments.  
Q: Were there a lot of other instances of -- that were of that kind?  
A: No more or less -- I never had any. In fa
ct, I used to socialize w ith Gentile people 
in America, and they  didn™t have to go th
ro ugh a Holo caust, and most of the time I 
behaved with good manners, and this how -- 
I behaved how I was raised to behave to 
be among people. And I got always the bigge
st respect. The other people who hardly 
know me, and th ey always 
respect me, and they wanted
 to socialize w ith me.

66
Q: Now, wha -- I wonder if your wife ran 
into any dis -- problems of discrimination? 
Was there anti German sentimen
t in those years after the war, or would that have been 
negligible? 
A: Yeah, it was anti sentiment, and -- duri
ng the war, and you cannot blame them, I 
think it™s a good things, ac
tually. Because wh atever the world did anything, had 
feelings about German bruta
lity, that it was more than 
justified. And I actually 
couldn™t see that Germany, wh atev er they 
did it, I don™t say everybody, but wa -- the 
majority -- and they  didn™t know it, and they
 claim they didn™t know it, but they did 
know it and everything, should deserve to 
have it [indecipherable] the nicest life. 
[indecipherable] Europe actua
lly, was in Germany. But nor
mally things like this, it 
will happen if you want it, or 
you don™t want it, but if you don™t make an issue of it, it 
just goes away. It comes, a
nd it goes away in no time. 
Q: Do you think that this so
ciety had improved in it™s sort of acceptance of different 
faiths?

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg. This is tape numbe
r four, side A. My question was, do you 
think there is less anti-Semitism in 1999? 
A: I don™t know exactly , you 
know, how to answer this que
stion, but my mind is if 
somebody want to be anti-Sem
itic, then I don™t -- I don™t think actually, if you have 
rules, regulations from the government, you --
 you -- about discrimi
nation, but if you -
- somebody doesn™t want to get friendly with yo
u, it™s no use -- if you try to fo rce it, it 
just backfires on you. And then you really
 -- you can increase anti-S emitism. I was 
always in my  vi -- my thinking, if some
body doesn™t like me, I 
going to have nothing 
against this person, he doesn ™t have to lik
e me, and I will find so
mebody else who will 
like me. 
Q: So it™s not something you can --  
A: No. 

Q: -- im-im-impose. 
A: No, not -- not -- nothing, I mean, I don™t lik
e to be imposed, or to -- if someb o dy to 
you is imposing, you know, to like you, or wh
atever -- I don™t go for it, no. I think if it 
doesn ™t come freely from you inside, it will 
never get the person the knowledge I -- to 
-- to change. They only
 change if you show your resp
ect, that somebody doesn™t want 
you, just leave him go, that™s 
all. Not particular fighting.

Q: Earlier in the interview, when you were 
talking about those years of the Ho locaust, 
you mentioned getting news 
thro ugh th e BBC, and I -- 
A: This was in Pola
nd [indecipherable] 
Q: Well, this was st
ill in Poland,yeah. 
A: Yes. 
Q: My question was -- I -- I wanted to ask yo
u mo re about that. Did you continue ever, 
to get BBC news in those years when you we
re in the camps? I assume there would be 
no way th en. 

A: No, no, it was impossible. No, this was im
possible, and in fact
, even I worked in 
the coal mine, we have been with Poles,
 Gentiles, together always, but it was not 
allowed, apparently, and never had a chance 
even to hear news, or even to look in  a 
piece -- a newspaper piece, or even what it 
was months or years old. No, we never 
knowed much. We know it only --in the camp we used to have feelings, if they treated 

us bad, beatings, or really to
rturing, well, we felt this a 
good things, that they have 
losses on the front. This -- this was our polic y, you know, to know what is going on. 
When  they  have been nice to us, we felt 
they have too many successes on the front. 
We like rather to suffer, and to be humiliate
d by the guards, and beaten by the guards, 
kicked by the guards
; then we had hope that maybe 
a change can be soon. But we 
never expect to be free people, or be in -- 
humans any mo re, anyway
, but this gave us 
some hope that eventually, 
sometimes, that maybe will be
 a survivor. You never figure 
that I will be the survivor. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
69
Q: Was there any basis, though, for your
 accepting that when you were suffering, 
things mu st be going badly? 
A: Oh yeah, I mean, this wa
s the truth, actually. Yeah 
we -- you -- you get used, and 
you realize, you know, when  th
ey  treat you bad, that they 
have losses on the front. The 
front didn™t go bad, and we never made a
ny mistakes, and th is 
was true. Sooner or 
later some of the conversation with guards, 
actually, what has not been too nasty, and 
then we realized they had big lo sses, and 
we realized why th-they treated the inmates 
so bad. [indecipherable] discuss the policy, 
this was the newspaper,
 how we have been 
treated. 

Q: Yeah. Then i-in 1945, wo
uld you be getting ne
ws then of wh at was happening, and 
that liberation may be close? 

A: In 1945, [indecipherable] 
liberated, if anybody who could walk , or move around, 
whatever, the only thi
ng what we as -- as survivors in 
camps, we only thought about, 
you know, how to get food. A
nd another that you -- you are 
able, if you feel hungry, 
that you can slice a slice of bread, and 
eat as much as you wanted. Otherwise the 
whole world didn™t exist yet, and our -- we 
still have been numb like you mentioned it, 

numbness. We have been numb , we didn™t co
me to realization that we survived, and 
we are humans, and we had to go on as 
a human being. No , we never had anything 
else to think, only abou
t hunger was about all. 
Q: And when you had no fo od, you™d men
tioned having fantasie
s ab out it, tell me 
what that was like. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
70
A: It -- it™s not a pleasant things. We used 
to get a ration of bread, where we used to 
discuss with each other, what -- how is the be
st thing to digest the ration? To eat up, 
and make you feel that you sa
tisfied your hunger, or take a 
bite now, and save it, and 
take a bite later? This -- we always have di
scussion what is the be
st. But a lot of times 
we realized if you don™t eat it up, you 
never know somebody will steal from your 
pocket, or when  you go to bed you have 
been  hiding, somebody steal away, so you 
didn™t -- never satisfied, y -- and you don™t -- 
cannot expect to get a ra -- other things, 
actually, wherein normally, 99 percent -- I was 
among those 99 percent, when  we got a 
ration, we had a chance, we ate what we got,
 and we didn™t had no worries to save it, 
to keep it in a safe place, or whatever. 

Q: Mm-hm. And you™d -- you™d have fantasies, is that right, about
 -- you™d be -- sort 

of dream of wonderful foods wh en you were close to starvation? 
A: Not ab out fancy food, never had any fantas
ies, we ju st had fantasies how to satisfy 
the hunger. Not suffering. 
Q: Right. Now, I wonder to wh
at extent you™ve been left with a hatred of any waste in 
food.  

A: Yes, still today. I cannot see waste of 
food whatsoev er. I my self, where we live we 
have extra acreage, and I have a -- a large 
garden, and I have the garden, than ks God, 
not fo r income, whatever, I can afford buy s
eeds, or wh atever labor it™s involved. It 
costs me money, and when ever I have to harv
est, I just hated to 
see that anything goes 
to waste, at home, or in the garden, cause 
a lot of times, if nobody comes to pick up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
71
some vegetables from the gard
en, I will go out of my way, and even travel hundred 
miles around trip, to give some friends from th
e garden . This hurt me
, to see food go to 
waste hurt me very, very much, and this will never change. 
Q: And y-your land, perhaps, has that extr
a meaning for you, as a kind of security? 
A: Not only about security very  mu ch, th
e land means for me actually that since I 
retired -- I™m already 10 years 
retired, that I don™t sit on a chai
r, just keep on resting. I 
always loved to wo rk, and physical work 
even when it™s hard 
for me to be more 
physical, I still love it, and I do it,
 and I think this keeps me alive. 
Q: You know, there™s a pattern too, of your 
surviving in prison, in
 slave labor camps, 
in Au schwitz, of you™re always, perhaps be
ing helped to survive 
by th e fact that you 
could wo rk and wo rk .  

A: Actually, some work even in the coal mine, their heavie
st work. This is like being a 
human, actually. If you see you accomp lish, ev
en for your biggest enemy, it give you 
satisfactory. If you co uld accomplish -- if you have
 been ab le to do it, where actually, 
if you work, the satisfactory is 
larger than th
e hard work.  
Q: And do you think th at -- I wo
nder if you have health pr
oblems today because of the 
-- all that h eavy labor, or has that -- or is 
that the reason that yo
u™re in such good 
health? 
A: This is a very hard to answer, but on
e thing actually. When  I was liberated in 
Theresienstadt, this was probably th e end of 
Ap ril, or beginning of May, in ™45, and I 
was so sick and ill actually, what I never expe
ct to be alive, and I never saw a doctor, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
72
whatever, to check me if
 I™m healthy or I™m sick
, until I came to Prague, 
Czechoslovakia where they accep
ted me in a sanitorium. Th
is was the first time a 
doctor examined me and check
 whatever they -- the sa
nitorium over there, the 
management, they strictly took in only DP
™s, Displaced Persons who had been  in a 
concen tration camp. And th ey treated us -- r
oyalty is ma ybe the proper word  to say. 
And the first medical docto r, he
 examined me, and he examin
ed me, he told me that I 
have an en larged heart. Even  without know
ing any medical terms, or whatever, I don™t 
know, I just happened to be that I asked this
 doctor, ﬁWill this stay
 with me forever?ﬂ 
And he said in medical terms, it™s hard to tell. Sometime, if you live a normal life, it 
goes back to normality, it will 
disappear, and a lot of times 
it™s will stay with you your 
whole life. So far, thanks God, I felt if I wo
rked physical, it helps me to stay alive, 
more or less. So I continually -- my doctor to
ld me that fairly I™m in  good shape, and 
whatever you do, he told me not to change  the formula, keep on doing th e same thing. 

And well, I™m doing it. 

Q: How would you get news 
today of wo rld affairs a
nd so on? Do you follow 
particularly carefully, or are you not inte
rested in papers, TV news, radio news? 
A: I™m interested, and I follow it, but I 
know not me even, because popular people, 
what know the politics and everything, it™s pol
itics, to be honest, personally, I think 
it™s a dirty trade. Nobody™s honest. Very 
rarely you can find so
mebody who tells you 
the truth, whatever. This how I feel. And in 
the other hand, as a little, ordinary person, 
you cannot change those things, either, so you just let them go.

Q: I -- I wondered, you know, wh-w hat -- 
what your attitude wa
s, because you can 
argue the opposite viewpoint,
 and say that what happened in the 1930™s was because -- 
I think you can argue this -- wa
s because the people who shou
ld have been involved in 
politics were standing by and a
llowing the, you know, things to change, and -- 
A: We showed you actually, that the -- not pe
ople, but countries, and I hate to criticize 
the United States, United States did a great de
al for me, whatever, and -- and I -- I feel 
that I try my best to be a good citizen, act
ually, but on the other 
hand, you read about 
the past, and you call it a world of civiliza
tion. In the whole wo rld -- I don™t want to 
mention name, but this is including the Unite
d States, where I™m a citizen, and I try to 
be a honest, good citizen, that the whole 
wo rld could stand by 
and see those horror, 
brutalities -- I don™t have the proper word 
to  mention about it, and I don™t think the 
dictionary  has even the proper wo rds. A
nd I don™t think you can express the proper 
word s to -- to express about those past, and 
doing nothing, this actually, you lose the 
belief in any civilization. There™s a part of
 me, it™s hard for me to believe that a 
civilized world exists.  
Q: Do you find it -- do you find it hard in re
lationships with people
 to trust them? Do 
you think you™re -- you™re different? I™ve known
 no suffering, and that trust -- trusting 
other human beings might be easier for me, 
or whether, in fact, you™re just the same? 
A: To me, actually, you know, trusting or not
 trusting, it™s har -- very hard  to trust 
people in general, but you feel more tr
usted when  you come along to  a Holo caust 
survivors, what they  had the same  expe
rience as me, and then I realize they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
74
understand. But a average person, if you™re
 Jewish or Gentile, it doesn™t make any 
different to me. But I realize right now, 
after 50 years, being mo re or less a normal 
person, that it™s hard to believe that it 
was so mu ch suffering for th ose people who 
have been in  concentration camps. And -- an
d even somebody would say, you know, it 
never existed, it™s just a hoax. A lot of times
 I -- I feel I™m not ma
d about it, but I feel 
as a normal person, with  normal thinking, y
ou have to believe it™s a h o ax, it™s not true. 
Q: Because it™s unbelievable? 
A: Th -- th -- exactly. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It™s unbelievable, I mean, this is the prop
er word. A lot of times 
I will in po -- in ger 
-- in English, and hard to express me the proper word s, but like you said, it™s 

unbelievable, in the same way, with as mu ch
 as you talk, or videos you in terview, but 
the true story will never come out. And I hope
 that we never come 
to a point where the 
true stories of new su fferings comes. 

Q: Because it goes on and on. You know, I 
wonder if you™d talk a little about the 
length of time that you were 
imprisoned, or in a camp . The term survivors used fo r 
people who were briefly in hiding, it™s a te
rm that covers many di
fferent cases, and I 
think you™re unusual in the period of time 
that you were held, or -- or suffered. Would 
you talk a little bit about that? 

A: I can talk as much as possible for me
. I mean, those things you don™t forg et 
actually. I was actually, when I came to Ausc
hwitz at this time, being Jewish was 100 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
75
percent impossible to s -- to live a day or tw
o. Gentiles who come to Auschwitz in ™41, 
a maximu m, I would say, you know, you co
uld live a day or two, and because the 
horrors were so great, was impossible. But in my
 case, actually, in fa
ct this is actually 
why I survived; I was in Auschwitz only -- 
direct in Auschwitz, I was only one day. 
The second day the Germans 
needed real bad -- around Au schwitz is a lot of coal 
mines, and they need ed  real bad people to go 
to the mines, but they
 didn™t trust Poles, 
who came to -- to Auschwitz actually, becaus
e you have to work with Poles, civilian 
Poles in the mine, they smuggle you out, or 
wh atever, so they neve
r took Po les to the 
mine. The only who they took to the mi
nes was Jewish, or Germans -- not Jew -- 
Germans we -- we were -- who have been th
e same way, have be
en prisoners in the 
camps. And the second day, actually, the same eight people who wa -- we have been 

stepped out being Jewish, we have been calle
d again to  be on the appelleplatz. And we 
came back, and a doctor came 
in Auschwitz, and we have 
been in Auschwitz, a doctor 
came and told us to take off our clothing, 
and everything, and examined us, our health, 
our -- and then he said, ﬁYou going to be se
nt to Yavishav itz,ﬂ and Yavishav itz was a 
coal mine camp . And this was a brand new 
camp, and at this time when we went to 

Yavishavitz, we couldn™t believe it that we
 are in Auschwitz. Ev
en Yavishav itz was a 
subcamp of Auschwitz. But it was no kapos, we
 have not been mistreated too bad. And 
the director from the coal mine came, and 
he spoke to us, and he says he™s only 
interested in one thing, this is to be good 
work ers in the mine. And he promised us if 
we will behave, we will do good work  in the mine, he will look into it that we are not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
76
mistreated, and we will be ge
tting proper food. We™ll be ab
le -- I was night shift, and 
he said, we -- you™ll be able to sleep du
ring the day. And in the beginning, was 
actually true everything, it was not so te
rrible, I mean, you could survive. The only 
thing was the hard work in the 
mine, but I used to talk to th
e one that was in charge in 
the mine, he was a Pole, and I used to ask 
him how lo ng can you 
live in the mine? He 
said, ﬁOh, people work here
 20 and 25 years.ﬂ And he 
told me you can survive you 
work ing in the mines. And he showed me 
how to hold the shovel proper, what is 
actually -- make it mu ch easier to work on 
it. And it was good until actually, til ™42, 
when they start with Jewish tr
ansport. And then wh
en they start with Jewish transport, 
they had so many people -- Jewish  people
, actually, and the most
 highly intelligent 
people fen Germany, French, Poland, Belg
ium, Italy. They come, they™ve been 
professional doctors, professors, very high 
tech people, and th ey
 send them in the 
mine, they last a day or two, this was all.
 And they lo oked only a way how to  dispose 
people. They  didn™t look any 
mo re for work ers, because they had to o many of them. In 
the camp when I came to Yavish avitz wa
s maybe 300 people. Wh en  the Jewish 
transport come, the -- in the 
same camp, in the same ba
rracks, they had 3000. And 
actually every week, used to come a truc
k in the cremato riums in Auschwitz, and 
picked up those who broke do
wn. It didn™t took too lo ng, actually for people, highly 
intelligent people to break down. I don™t know even it took 
a week, took days. They all 
got to th e point of not being able any mo re
 to work, and -- and the rule of the camp, 

especially in Au schwitz was, if you are not ab
le to work , you don™t have a right to live, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
77
and so you -- they automatic
ally -- you know it, if you 
cannot wo rk, you go to  the 
crematoriums. 
Q: You know, I read that -- and this I think 
was in some museum material s, tha t those 
who had been in the ghettos, and had experi
enced longer periods 
of hardship, seemed 
to -- 
A: Survive longer. 
Q: -- survive longer. I mean, wha -- wh
a -- you fo und that to be true? 
A: Exactly. It™s exactly  this, the full truth.
 Numb er one, you know
, I was in the 20™s, 
and I was fairly healthy, and even at home,
 you know, I™m raised in a home, even we 
had the -- and en ough money and everything, yo
u know, being this 20
 year old boy, to 
enjoy life, maybe I been raised really restri
cted, that the same way is nothing, ju st run 
around, you have to do to 
get the feeling and understandi
ng if you are a human being, 
alive, you have to perform something. It 
doesn™t mean anything 
but physical work. If 
you read books, was okay with my parents, 
but doing nothing was not all right. So I 
was used, actually, to let -- not coal mine la b o r, but I still was used to keep myself 
busy -- 
Q: Pulling your weight. 

A: -- and to do work. And later, when actua
lly I came to Yavish
avitz and worked in 
the coal mi ne, and somebody explained me 
how to manage to have it easier, th is 
helped me a great deal, and this actually 
-- this made me surv
ive. Later on actually, 
you know, when  Jewish transport came, ever
ything finish ed, but they  used to  get the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
78
rations for 300 people, it™s 3000. It was ju
st too bad, you know
, those rations have 
been distributed among 3000 people. And 
it started getting rougher and ro ugher and 
rougher. They didn™t even l
ooked any more for labors, fo
r good labors, they just 
looked how to dispose those people who -- w
ithout a bullet, without the crematorium. 
This how it went on all the time.  
Q: Mm-hm. Wasn™t Auschwitz itself 
quite new when  you were there? 
A: Yeah, exactly. Brand new, practically. 
The ausch -- when  I came in ™41, was only 
existed -- I don™t think a year old ev en, 
less than a year old, practically, yeah. 
Q: What are your thoughts about that, when
 you see the -- the map of Auschwitz, and 
the -- the many, many subcamps? This so
rt of mankind making this giant killing 
machine, you -- i -- i -- i -- course, you said it before, it™s unbelievable, but -- 

A: I be honest, I mean from 
the beginning we didn™t kn
ow it, actually, what had 
happened. Later we heard stor
ies a little bit from here, and 
from there, and then we 
realized what is going on. An
d automatically we know it,
 you know, like our parents 
didn™t had a chance, you kn
ow. We know it, they have been destroyed in th e 
crematorium before we even -- if you have
 been young age, yo
u know, between 18 
and 30, you had a chance maybe, 
they put you in fo
r working, that 
you will work. But 
things actually, to thinking about the Ge
rmans, they have been so organized, 
everything. People who read the past about
 concen tration camps, they think it™s just 
came by accident. It didn™t come by accident. 
I realized now even
, you know, before 
when I was there, I didn™t think about it, 
but now I can recall, and I realize that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
79
everything was so planned. As
 soon as you come to Ausc
hwitz, they took
 away  your 
identity, you didn™t had a name any more. 
You been like a dog, you got a tag, a 
number, and you wear unifo rm, and they don™
t call you anything no mo re, and they -- 
they call you -- they call you by the number. 
I reme mb er even my self, when I got the 
number -- 
Q: That™s the number on your arm? 
A: Yeah -- no, I didn™t -- was not tattooed wh
en I came to Auschwitz, I was a p o litical 
prisoner, so my  clothing went in a bag 
like any other person. I was photographed I 
don™t know how many times, several time, you 
know, turn  your head and bumps here 
and there. And -- and anothe
r thing, whoever was documen
ted -- they called us, you 
know, like we come from a prison, and we 
came, they have docu
ment, you know, like 
the transport had a list. You know, some kept
 the list, and some throw it away the list, 
because know it -- they know it -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg.  This is tape num
ber four, side B. You were documented? 
A: Yeah, and being a document, I don™t know
 why -- why th ey have been afraid, those 
SS or Gestapo. Normally, as a 
rule in every camp like a --  I mean, I can tell only where 
I was in Yavishavitz, that had they called it 
a ravia, it was like first aid. You know, I 
mean, sick ness didn™t exist, I never hear
d in a camp  that somebody got sick. No t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
80
[indecipherable] you never heard of it. Oh, you dropped dead, so -- a -- a normal thing, 
actually, that™s all. But sick, this didn™t ex
ist. I never was sick. Neither other thou -- 
other thousands that is, but if
 you went in fo r some help
, in this ravia, there are 
docto rs, you know, they  all have been prison
ers, also haftlinger, and okay, they  kept 
you til one night. If yo -- the othe
r day, you have not been able
 to go out -- go to y -- to 
the coal mi ne, or other commanders what 
they have wo rking commanders, if you have 
not been able to go, th-then, it was no mo re
 time left, so the next day come a truck 
from the crematorium and picked  you up, and -- 
and this was the end, or so you -- this 
more or less, everybody was afraid to 
go in the [indeciph
erable] been sick. 
Q: And that™s why one person 
might help someone else to 
-- to get back from the mine 
and hand in their lamp. 
Anything to  keep  going. 
A: Oh, this is a -- with the 
last strength, wh atever you ha
d. I remember one time, he 
was from -- from Bendine, Paul Oberslazin, 
more or less, a Jewish middle aged, he 
was mu ch older than  me. He mu st have been
 in the late 40™s. And every second week, 
I think, there used to come 
from Auschwitz a doctor -- and yo
u have been to ld to take 
off your clothes, and -- and he examined y
ou, he looked  at your 
body, how your -- how 
your are with your health or wh atever. No
t examined, but he just
 looked at the body. 
And normally what they  looked is on th e -- 

Q: Bottom. 
A: -- bottom, like, yeah. And if it was 
in, you know, you™re not been out -- 
Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
81
A: The bottom got in. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, they called it a musselman. 

Q: Oh. 

A: And they said -- 
Q: I never understood the 
mu sselman [indecipherable] 
A: Musselman, yeah. This meant th
at you™re not capable to work . 
Q: You™re so malnourished. 

A: M-Malnourished, or whatever, you™re no
t capable to work , an
d they put you -- took 
your number off, and they put
 you on the list, and the ne
xt day the wagon come from 
the cremato rium, and they have to go. At 
this time, becau se I was over there, one from 
the oldest prisoners, inmates, 
and you know, you™re always 
have been already prefare -
- pre -- you know, prepared, actually -- more
 privileged than a regular person, you 
know, they know it. I was ove
r there in ™41, you know, so
 everybody lo oked  me. And 
one time I had a chan ce o -- the one who to ok
 the -- put down the 
numbers, the same 
way, you have been forced to
 put down the number
 on the list, whatever they have to 
know it. I know him, I was with him togethe
r. So he came over to me, he knowed me 
by name, he called me  with -- by name, he sa
ys, ﬁPlease help me.ﬂ And he was on the 
list to -- I don™t remember even his name. He 
says, ﬁI™m a rich ma
n, you know. I have 
a lot of wealth, and everything. I™d do anything
 in the world if you can save my  life.ﬂ I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
82
told him, ﬁHow can I save your life?ﬂ He says
, ﬁSee that they take
 me off in the list.ﬂ 
And nobody dared to  do th ings lik
e this, you know. Anyway -- 
Q: Whatever wealth -- 
A: He couldn™t -- he saw I cannot help him,
 so he tried -- for some reason he smuggled  
himself in to the day co mmander, you kno
w, who march to the coal mine. He 
smuggled himself in -- they counted always
, they saw it, they 
know how many people 
they have to send to  the mine, how many. If 
it was too many, they -- they didn™t let out 
nobody, they  waited until they got
 straight. I don™t know how he
 did it, but he did it, he 
smuggled himself, and he went in  the coal 
mine. You know wh at those beasts did? 
When the wagon came, he picked up thos
e all from the list, and they saw he was 
missing, and apparently wherever they rea
lize, you know, they had a plus, and they 
knowed exactly in which mine he is, whatev
er. They to ok the wagon -- the truck, and 
they went in the mine, they brought him up 
to the -- in the mine, and took him to the 
crematorium. This how a -- 
and you know what else, ho
w accurate they have been, 

how planned everything was? This is unbelie
vable. As little they fed us, but -- but it 
belonged, you know, for every 
prisoner, a ration of bread, 
if you got a hundred  grams, 
200 grams, whatever, this -- th
ey have been responsible, 
this belongs to you. They 
have those people on the truck, and they ga
ve everyone a ration, what it belonged. He 
still was alive, and so  he was entitled to th
e ration. They gave him the ration. This 
how, you know, [indecipherable] comes to
 me how well everything was organized. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
83
And whatever it came, it didn™t come just
 happening, you know? Everything was 
planned. 
Q: It™s really the sort of -- I think this is much written about, but the -- the nature of 

evil, it™s like --  

A: It™s a little b
it more than evil. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It™s a little bit more. An
d they -- the first st
ep in the Nazis was 
actually when you 
came to a camp, they dehumanize you. They
 took away whatev
er you could. The 
physical, and th en they  went mentally, and th
ey realized the only 
way, you know, they 
will not give you enough food, and so your 
brain cannot think nothing else except 
food. And then they con -- c
ontrol you, they don™t have 
to afraid that somebody will 
run away, or somebody will stand up, you 
know, and say I™m getting killed anyway, I 
kill a -- a -- a guard, or whatev
er. It didn™t make any differen
t. They know that the next 
hour he will get killed, so what™s the differe
nt? But they took ever
ything away what a 
human being have inside in 
him. And then they know it,
 we will follow all this, and 
everything what they  ask. They  don™t 
have to watch you, even. And this was 
everything planned, you know. 

Q: Yeah, so that you™re broken, really. 
A: Exactly, broken is the 
proper word. Yeah, they br
oke down you completely. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
84
A: Physical because you have 
to work hard, and 
they don™t give y
ou enough food. This 
they broke right away, this wa
s easy. Mentally was a little b it harder, but if they keep 
on breaking little bit and little bit, then 
mentally you loseeverything, too. 
Q: Mm-hm. You know, I wonder other everyday
 things that give you sort of traumas. 
I™m thinking of coffee, and the fact that th
at would be the only wa
y you could  wash at 
sa -- at -- at some stage. I think of anothe
r time when you could ba
rely stand, and you 
were given raw carrots, and s 
-- almost miraculously -- 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: -- you had the strength to stand. But s 
-- do you sometimes find that some little -- 
some material thing you™ll see in front of y
ou nowadays that will br
ing back a flood of 
horrible memories. 
A: [indecipherable] in general, actually, ev
en if I can™t afford, 
I just like being too 
much comfortable, a luxury. Ev
en if I can™t afford, I just 
-- I feel su ffering a little bit 
release in -- in myself, you 
know, that I™m survived. Ev
en if I go to a doctor, you 
know, doctors trying to give you -- I neve
r want to take medicine, everything, and 
whenever it comes to anesth
etic, I tell the doctor, don™t 
worry, pains I can take, you 
don™t have to wo rry. They have me all on re
cord, Morris refused to take medication, or 
something to  relieve pains. Yeah, they have 
me on the record [indec
ipherable] and th is 
how actually I -- I feel actually, if I suffe
r, it feels me a little 
bit release from th e 
pressure what I lost. I-It™s hard 
to explain, but this how he is.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
85
Q: Yeah. I-I -- I -- I just -- you have -- do yo
u sometimes have dist
urbed nights, when  
dreams come back? 
A: Comes back pretty often. You trying to  ig
nore, you talk yourself in, you know, just 
keep on going. 

Q: Was the -- is that -- if you lo ok back 
over 50 years, does that happen -- does it 
happen more recently, or ki -- have you -- 
I wondered, have you 
been able to bury it 
for parts of your life? 

A: It™s no -- no way -- I can speak for myself
 what I think this 
is for anybody who 
survived. It™s no way in the 
wo rld that you can bury it. If you want it, or you don™t 
want it, it will surface. If it doesn™t surface 
hundred percent, it 
surface 50 percent, 60 
percent. But just to ignore it, no way. 

Q: It™s too -- too profound a part 
of your life, I would imagine.  
A: Probably, yes it is. 

Q: Actually, it™s a question I should ask. 
You know, looking back, 
what was the best 
time of your life?  
A: All my family, and feeling the love, that
 I was loved. And we, all kids, all of our 
brothers and sister, we had sense enough resp
ect our family, and try to give back our 
love the same what their love was to us. 
This is a way -- you cannot forget those 
things. And this what [indecipherable] you kn
ow, wh at makes life so miserable, why I 
don™t want to enjoy life, even I ca
n afford. I just don™t feel proper. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
86
Q: Mm-hm. Also -- also, I think you™d -- you™
d see how material th
ings are so -- sort 
of flippant. 
A: Yeah. I -- I never believed, and I never e
xpected to material th
ings, actually, until I 
come to the United States, and then I reali
zed if you have money, you treat it better, y -
- and anyway -- and I saw I missed the boat
. I didn™t do it like some  other did, but I 
still don™t regret it. It™s [indecipherable] 

Q: I hope we™re not completely materialistic
. But that makes me  think of those young, 
Jewish women, who sounded as if they were
 so materialistic just
 after the war, when 
their -- they -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- they go after the boyfriends
 who could provide well for them.  

A: Yeah, this is mostly, actually, people.
 People who didn™t had [indecipherable] 
nothing, you know, had been  poor and ever
ything. And th ey looked out, and they  
succeeded. It was a chance, th
is was the only chance after the war to succeed. If you 
missed, you missed the boat. 
Q: Yeah. You know, you sp oke earlier in 
-- in  -- in tellin g a story, y -- but you 
mentioned the can that you carri
ed, that I think all -- all of 
you would have on you, so 
that if there were any food -- 
A: Oh, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
87
Q: -- you could get it. And I just felt that
 was especially meaningful to me, and I 
wonder if you™d -- d -- do you rememb er the years that you had that, and what it 
looked like, and -- and when you 
no longer carried it with you? 
A: What, the can? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Oh, this was in the camp all th e tim
e. I mean, in Auschwitz, we was more 
organized actually. You know, they  looked at 
you that you are -- kept yourself clean. 
They killed you if you didn™t kept yourse
lf clean. But later, in the later camps, 
actually, in Buch enwald, wh ere you have been
 in [indecipherable] was so filthy and 
dirty, I never had a -- another shirt when I 
left Auschwitz til actu ally I was liberated, 
you know. And I mentioned actually in th
e tape to -- we didn™t have no water, you 
couldn™t wash yourself actually. The same wa
y it was just organized to make your life 

so miserable actually, that you will give up 
life, and this what 
did happen, this was 
true.  
Q: Did you ever, after the Holocaust, have 
any co unseling? I think mo st -- a-any so rt 
of psychotherapy, or anything? 
A: No. 

Q: I understand mo st survivors have -- yeah -- 
A: No, never [indecipherable] 
Q: -- you know -- never had any formal -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
88
A: Never had anything. I know it one thing, 
that counseling will not
 help, you have to 
have the strength to help  yourself. I never 
believed it -- too mu ch in th e counseling. 
Q: Yeah. That™s -- that was wh
at I thought, but I -- I j -- 
I just thought I would ask it. 
You told  me that you had returned to your
 birthplace. Would you tell me a bit mo re 
about family -- 
A: I tried to go back. 
Q: Yes, you tried to go back . 

A: It was 30 kilometers from my hometown,
 and I came by train over there, and I 
figured, because I had brothers
 -- I was the youngest, but I still had brothers that had 
been pretty young, and my  olde
st sister had three kids already. The oldest girl was at 
this time -- before ™39, she wa
s probably  11 years old. In ™45 sh e was 17. And I figured  

maybe because we had been respected by 
Gentile people, too, you know, maybe 
they™re -- somebody hid them
, or wherever. I had hope 
that I find somebody. I -- 
parents we didn™t dream, we know wh at had happened , so we -- we gave up 

automatically, but -- but the brothers and sist
ers, we always had 
any hope. And as soon 
I was able to walk in Theresienstadt, I took
 a train, and traveled to the home, to the 
nearest hometown -- like I mentioned, we di
dn™t have the railroad 
station. The closest 
railroad station was Ro donsko. And I got off 
in Rodonsk, and I ask those people, any 
Jew survivors? They  -- they didn™t s -- 
know it exactly, whoever I ask, I don™t 
remember, even. So they
 told me the only way is you have to go out on the road  and 
see where -- if the road leads 
n -- to Ch adbush, be there, and just ask to take you along.

It was no -- at this time  was not too many ca
rs, a car was a novelty, very hardly saw it. 
We saw buses, maybe, to take passengers, bu
t the mo st -- the other way was by horse 
and buggy. And I went on the 
ro ad , and stood over there, and suddenly see somebody 
with the horse and buggy co mes, and I looked
, and his face looked familiar to me. So 
finally, what closer he got, the more I c
ould see who it was, and I called him by his 
name. Bentkofsky was his name. I said, ﬁBen
tkofsky.ﬂ And he looke
d, and looked, and 
he stopped the horse [indecipherab le] and l
ooked at me. And he says, in Po lish, ﬁTi 
zheerz?ﬂ It means, you are alive? You know?
 And I realize how he greet me. A nd 
then, you know, then he
 ask me if I know th at those ei
ght people who surviv ed not the 
camp, who survived , they have been  hidden 
somewhere, whatever, that they all have 
been killed. They lived
 all Jewish home, and they all ha
ve been killed. I didn™t know 
nothing, this was the first ti
me. He told me about it. 
Q: And he told you the names? 

A: He told me the name, a
nd I knowed every one of them
, whoever they told me. And 
I got really hysterical. I start to cry, and -- 
and I told him in Polis
h, I spoke in Polish. 
And I said, ﬁYou know why I went through Au
schwitz. I didn™t go as a Jew.ﬂ He know 
it probably, because he wa -- 
he worked in the factory, 
you know, like I told you, he 
used to carry finished merchandise to 
be shipped. He took it to the railroad 
[indecipherable] he was -- he knows me, and 
the family. He knows 
everything about it. 
I said, ﬁYou know I didn™t go to
 Auschwitz as a Jew.ﬂ  
Q: But as a Pole. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
90
A: As a Pole, yeah, political reasons. Probably
 he know it about th e factory with  the 
double bookkeeping, cause th
at was in. And I was so moved, I couldn™t take it any 
mo re. I think I spit on him. I didn™t know what
 to do, what not to do, but I think it this 
was I did. And then  came out a woman, was near a building also, and she came out 
and I -- she must have been -- told me that  sh e was Jewish -- she is Jewish too. And 
she ask me what™s going on, wh at™s happened.
 She saw me, I was cry ing. I told her the 
story. Sh e said, ﬁPlease, one thing. You 
cannot go back  to Chad bush. Go to Lódz, 
Warsaw, larger town. Over th
ere goes some Jewish people, you meet survivors, not 
survivors. Go over there mo re or less you 
safe. But the Chad bush
,ﬂ she said, ﬁyou 
don™t go to Chad bush, no way 
in  the wo rld.ﬂ And she told  
me about the same th ing. 
Q: Yeah. Why? Because she feared
 if this could happen once -- 
A: Because [indecipher
able] for my life. 
Q: Yeah, in -- that™s w h at I meant,
 if this horror could happen once -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- it could be repeated. 
A: Exactly. And she figured, you know, I th
ought actually I come over there, and 
maybe I stay in Po land. I didn™t had nobody 
in any country, relatives or not, where 
should I go? I was born over there, we had houses over there. 

Q: Had hopes that your brothers
 were alive kept you going? 
A: Yes, I did. I did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
91
Q: So which -- so you know, on
 -- at that mo ment, it was as if y -- this was like a final 
blow, I assume. 
A: Sure, it was the final blow, and the wo man 
took me into her hous
e, and she told me 
I should stay overnight over there, and say 
the next day, go wherev er you wanted, but 
you have to go to a large city. A small town 
is not safe for you to go. She begged me, I 
reme mb er, I don™t know if she gave me food. Well, a poor wo man, too, actually, I 
remember. But I slept over ther
e, and the minute I saw daylight, I just walked off, out 
the door, I didn™t thank for nothing, I di
dn™t say goodbye, or not goodbye. I just 
walked out. And I went straight to the ra
ilroad station, and I didn™t know -- I didn™t 
know wh ere to go or what to
 do. But finally I said I™d 
try to go back maybe, to 
Theresienstadt, or whatever, see other fri
ends, and where they go, I will go. I -- I 
didn™t know what to do. And I took the trai
n, I went back to Czechoslovakia, and came 
to Prague, actually. 
Q: Why Prague? Was -- or was this real
ly just it could have been anywhere? 
A: Anywhere, yeah, exactly, I mean Prague
 meant the same lik
e I don™t know, like 
Brazil, or you name it. I didn™t know it. 
I was -- never was in Prague, and I never 
traveled too much in
 Poland, and so I didn™t know
 it -- the different between one 
country and the other country. 
Q: Except that you mentioned having a dislik
e of the thought of going to  Ru ssia, or -- 
or -- or being in  the care of Russians -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
92
A: Well this -- this I left. I -- I was rais
ed -- we have not been -- our -- our whole 
family, actually, because being business pe
ople, we never have any sentiment or 
likeness for Russians. 
Q: What was that based on? 

A: That Communism was as bad 
as Nazism, that™s all. O v er 
there you are told what to 
wear, what to eat, and what this. You know,
 the Nazis, you know, it was another --  
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- it was no different between each other, th
ey™re just a different color is about all 
[indecipherable]. This was actually bef -- wh
en I came back to -- to Prague, and I 
didn™t know nobody in Prague. 
It happened  to be on th e railroad station the same way, 
by accident, I see a familiar face. He was w
ith me -- he c -- he was from Belgium, 
from Antwerp. And he came from the first 
transport, came actually from Belgium, 
Holland. And he came in ™42, maybe spring ™
42, or this I don™t know either, exactly, 
but he was from the earliest Jewish transport,
 he came with the Jewish transport. And 

we used to be in the same barrack. And I 
remember, and I said -- I said, ﬁJulius?ﬂ And 
he says, ﬁYeah, Kornberg.ﬂ We
ll, we recognize each other, 
and so we talked about it. 
He was in Buch enwald, too, but during th e 
march, when they to
ok us away from over 
there, he had a chance, one from the guard 
to ld a reichsdeutsch, a German, you know, 
that he should go, organize,
 take away a couple horses,
 and -- and over there, you 
know, they need
ed horses. So he took
 him along, so they 
just took off, they 
disappeared . So  he saved himself a lot of th
ings in his life probably, because 80, no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
93
mo re, 90 percent, or even 95 percent didn
™t made it, you know, after those ma rches 
and this -- everything. [indecipherable
] ask me where you going. I told him 
[indecipherable] I says, ﬁI don™
t know.ﬂ ﬁWhat you going to 
do?ﬂ ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ And 
he ask me, ﬁDid you go back  
home?ﬂ I told him I tried it, and they  tell me  I shouldn™t 
go in this town. Well, he looked -- and he 
was a very nice guy 
-- and he™s still, you 
know, because we meet together, the Red Cr
oss gets us together. Julius Bear is his 
name. He™s originally from Hamburg, 
but when the Germans kicked out those 
[indecipherable] in Germany,
 they send him to a border, 
you know, and so he ended 
up, his parents and him, they went to An twer
p in -- in Belgium. A
nd so he said that 
they go back to 
Belg ium, to Antwerp, and he had a 
whole group was Jewish boys, too. 
He said, ﬁCome along.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy not? I 
don™t know wh ere else to go.ﬂ I went in, 
but you had to go in  to the 
council first, to pass, you 
know. Well, he told me, you 
know, where Antwerp lays, near Antwerp, wh
ere this town -- I don™t recall even the 
town, but he told me. He sa
id the council probably will 
ask you a few questions. And 
if he ask you, you know wh at is next to An
twerp, and that city. Okay. So I waited over 
there until I was called in, I ca
lled in to the council. He 
ask completely things, you 
know, that I didn™t know, weren™t familiar 
so he right away -- he was very polite, he 
smiled at me, and he kindly 
touched my  back , he says, ﬁYou™re not from Belgium.ﬂ 
And he says, ﬁI™m sorry I cannot let you go
. You™re not from Belgium.ﬂ I came back 
out, and I told him, ﬁThe council don™t let me
 go through, he recognize that I am not 

from Belgium.ﬂ Well, he told me
 that they stayed
, they came a nigh
t before, and th ey 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
94
stayed where in Prague, in a sanitorium. Mo
stly in the sanitori
um, he said there™s 
people from concentration camps over there. 
And he said it™s a very good place, they 
take good care of you, and I should go ov
er there to the sanitorium. You know, he 
gave me the address, how to  go, wh ateve
r, I didn™t know nothing. Well, he went to 
Antwerp, an-and I went over 
there to the sanitorium. Yeah
, he warned me not to tell 
that I am from Poland, they 
have skirmishes, the Czechs 
and Po les. He said, ﬁIf you 
say you™re from Poland, they w
ill not take you in.ﬂ Well, said all rig h t, we didn™t had 
no ID™s anyway, nobody knows, you could tell 
anything. Well, I came over there, and 
they ask me where I am, I told them I™
m from Germany. Which city? I told them 
Hanover. I didn™t know even where Hanove
r is, I didn™t know it. Ok ay, so th ey 

document me over -- over there, I had no 
other identification that I am from in 
Hanover. And the first thing is this was the fi
rst time I saw a doctor.
 It was a beautiful, 
clean place, good food and everything. They 
gave me a number on the second floor, a 
room to stay over, everything unusua
lly clean. But even for somebody from a 
concen tration camp, but in general, you know, 
was a nice place. A nice section, too, it 
was almo st outside Prague. In th e mo rning,
 around 10 o™clock, a doctor came, and 
examined me. I was n o t used -- 
I never was examined before. 
Q: Except to see if you were capable of labor. 
A: Yeah, oh. And examined me
, and I -- I think I mentioned 
already, and then he told 
me I have a enlarged heart, and he
 called the nurse, and he told her -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061

A: -- that I should not go 
up on the second floor, they  should give me a room 
downstairs, that I --

Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Morris Kornberg. This is tape number five, side A. 
A: I was over there, and they actually save
d my life, because I was still in very bad 

shape when I came to the san
itorium. But they fed us so 
good, and the friendship from 
the Czechs was so great. Used 
to come for entertainment 
in the evenings, didn™t do 
nothing except ate, and sit around. They  used
 to send th em young girls in school, kids, 
beautiful kids, beautiful girls, and they came
 in, they talked to us, and I -- I know how 
I looked, you know, sh
aved  and everything, and terrible,
 shaved and ev erything. They  
used to tell how beautiful I am, I mean I kno
w the truth, and I knowed why they do it, 
make me feel good. 
Q: Human again. 
A: Yeah, they made -- tried to do, they tr
ied to do anything, yo
u know, to make you 
comfortable, and they did. And til today I ca
 -- will never forget 
that they actually -- 
the Czechs in the sanitorium sa
ved my life. So I stayed over there about four weeks. 
But later, you see, go out in th e streets, and you saw those Russian soldiers, and -- you 
know, I -- like I mentioned, I was rais
ed and I had none -- much sympathy for 
Russians. And I saw how they ™re dressed, you 
know, on one foot he had a shoe, on one 
foot a boot. You know, terrible. And I start 
to dislike, you know, being over there in 
Prague. And one time I met a couple boys, th
ey came from Germany, actually. They  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
97
did business, you know, they b
ought up clothing in Germany,
 they were -- sold it in 
Czech -- or vice-a versa, I don™t know. Th
ey made money, that™s all. And -- 
Q: So there was an awful lot of that going on. 
A: Oh yeah, sure. 

Q: [indecipherable] keeping. 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Yeah. And probably 
fulfilling a useful role. 
A: They have been smart e
nough to realize th at they 
don™t had nobody any mo re who 
will look at them. They did the 
right thing. A la -- they know
 what they ha
ve to do on 
their own to make money, and they did ma
de it. They ask me -- we met each other, 
and they ask me from where I am, which ca
mp I was. And I told them everything 
about it, and that I couldn™t go back home 
to my  hometown. And 
they said -- I told 
them, I don™t like -- that everything is good, 
clean, food, everything, but I feel of -- 
fairly all right, but the only thing is 
I don™t like to see Russians next to me 
[indecipherable]. Told me why don™t you go 
to  the American zone, the English zone. 
They  take care of you, they do this, it™s 
mu ch better, you ge -- if you want, we can try 
to do business, you know. Th -- you have 
more freedom. I listened to him, and in 
Prague were used to be office where the 
-- they did th e deportation to wh ere you came, 
you know. They  organized, a
nd they had buses, you know. And certain days, ev en 
they went this direction, this direction. An
d I came over there to this office, and I say I 
want to go home. They ask me where, and 
sh  -- I told them Hanover. ﬁOh,ﬂ she said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
98
ﬁHanover is bad. We very rare have a bus
 go to Hanover. A lot of times you could 
have to wait for it two, three weeks.ﬂ Then
 was a German in th
e office, I don™t know 
what he did, and he says, ﬁOh, you know 
what? I drive tomorrow to
 Stuttgart.ﬂ And he 
says, ﬁIf you wanted, I can take you to Stuttgar
t, and Stuttg art you go
ing to be closer to 
Hanover than in Prague.ﬂ He says 
he just meet me here and here. 
Q: What was that journey like? What 
was that journey like with the German? 
A: Didn™t bothered me, you know, I felt th
at h e™s a very polite, decent person. He 
offered me a -- you know, a ride, he takes me  along. 
Q: Yes. 
A: He know that I don™t have money, and I cannot pay. 

Q: I just wondered if there was clos
e -- if you talked, and -- and whether -- 
A: Oh yeah, sure. 
Q: -- whether he found out you we
ren™t really from Hanover, or -- 
A: Oh no, no, just my -- no, 
he didn™t, and he just want
 to do a favor for me, and I 
figured -- you know, I appreciated the favo
r. No, we didn™t think about nothing else, 
except -- and true enough, he to
ld me in the mornin
g, meet me  here and there, and he 
took me with his car. Took 
a long time, you know, and I think in  the evening ev en, 
they still had curfew at this time, you was not
 allowed to travel 
for private, excepts, 
you know, military. Finally, in 
the morning, when -- whateve
r, he arrived in Stuttgart, 
and -- and he said this is as 
far as he go. I -- he let me 
off. First thing the -- I don™t 
know who to ld me, this I don™t rememb er 
even, that I should go over -- where he let 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
99
me off was not far away  was a school. The na
me of the school is Yakob Shula. Yakob 
School. And he said, ﬁGo over there, 
over there mo st people come home from 
concentration camps, they stay over there unt
il they know where to 
go, or what.ﬂ So I 
went in, this was -- must be a Friday I arrive
d in Stuttgart, yeah. An
d I went over there, 
was a big room, a school, real huge. It was 
maybe 20 beds, or whatever. They gave 
you a bed, you know, to sleep 
in, and they  gave you always 
a slip, a cross the st reet was 
a restaurant where they gave you a slip fo
r breakfast, or dinner, supper, whatever. Oh, 
this is all right, I mean, I didn™t feel nothi
ng wrong in  -- you know, about this. I mean, 
it was great. I went over there overn ight, and in  the mo rning, I didn™t know Stuttg art, 

but I went down  in the center of the Stuttg
art, and looked around
. And then I notice a 
couple boys, and theylooked at me, and I looked at th
em. You know, this was not hard 
to recognize. Finally we get closer a little bi t, I went their way, and they came my way, 
and finally they ask me in Hebrew , Amah
oud? Means if you are Jewish, you know. I 
told them yeah, I am Jewish. 
And they said they™re Jewish, 
too. They  ask me the story 
where I was, I told them, you know, in Au schw
itz I work ed in a coal mine, and I just 
come from Prague where I was in a san
itorium, and I -- somebody brought me to 
Stuttgart. Well, they told me, oh -- he says --
 yeah, this what they told me first, they 
ask me where I stay. I told them the Yakob 
Shula. They  say, ﬁOh, Jewish people don™t 
stay in the Yakob Shula.ﬂ This is maybe 
for Germans, other nationality, not Jewish 
people. 

Q: This is where you sh
ould go, th ey
 told you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
100
A: And I said, ﬁVery well, where do I go? I mean, I don™t have nobody.ﬂ Oh  see, they 
told me go to Dagaloff. Dagalo
ff is the outskirt of Stuttgar
t. This is 90 -- 90 percent 
villas, and the most beautiful area ever s
ee, you know, landscaping, beautiful. It™s on 
higher ground, Stuttgart is in
. They call it castle in the lo
wer part. And they said, ﬁYou 
go over there, it™s a sanitorium.ﬂ And over
 there where Jewish 
people go, you know, 
come from the concentration camp. And I come
 over there, actually, a beautiful villa, 

sanitorium, re -- the grounds, everything,
 gardens and all kinds. Was a sanitorium 
before the owner -- it was his name, Katt 
sanitorium. He was a Nazi apparently. 
Eisenhower, all the -- the biza -- the troops 
who were occupied to  kick him out from 
the sanitorium, and let all [indecipherable] 
camps -- in concentration camp live in the 
sanitorium. I -- I didn™t had -- the eyes kept
 on looking, and looking, wh erever, how 

beautiful and ev erything. And same way, 
they had to -- the German government was 
forced to supply the best foods. The occupati
on -- the soldiers used
 to tell them they 
don™t care from where they get it, but they 
want for -- for those who camp in camps, 
the best, nothing less than thebest. And th is what they  ha
d to do. Anyway, I came over 
there, and then I met Fedderman, he was with
 me in -- in Buchen
wald, in Traylitz. And 
we have been togeth er where I met him, a
nd so we -- we shared the room together. 
Q: You mentioned when you 
were talking earlier, about your family memb er who 
went back  to Stadbush. 

A: Chadbush. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
101
Q: Chadbush, your hometown. This is mu ch
 more recently, but I wonder if you™d 
briefly tell me, on tape, about that visit. 
A: Oh, this was my niece. She™s a prof
essor, a doctor profe
ssor, she teaches in 
Rowland University in -- in Florida, Orlando,
 near Orlando. They  
live in -- in Winter 
Park, Florida. And she just made up -- then
 this was the plan. She™s -- normally she 
goes all over the world from the university, 
always with conferences, nofa. So she 
decided, and her husband, she wants to go in
to the hometown where 
I was born, this is 
a -- a daughter of my brother from Israel, sh e™
s a Israeli, too. And sh e ask me if I want 
to go along, I -- I told her I 
don™t think I f-feeled for it, to 
do it. She said she still wants 
to see it. They went along 
in July. They vis
ited the hometown , and she was very  nice 
greeted. She had a letter to the mayor of Ch
adbush from the mayor from Winter Park. 
Sh-She had it translated, actu
ally. And he really was a -- he looks a very pleasant 
person, a nice person, the mayor from the to
wn, from Chadbush. He 
is more or less a 
younger generation, too. He™s
 -- he™s maybe in the 40™s, something like this, and he 
was very, very nice to her, and everything. 
And sh e -- she™s very excited about it, and 
they made a video. She send me a copy, the 
last night we watched it, actually. I was 
not excited about it, you know. She ask me befo
re if I want to go along, and I told her, 
I don™t think so. Wh en I saw the video, or ev
en befo re I saw the video, and she told me 
over the phone, I realized it would tear me 
apart to step in, yo
u know, where I lost 
everything, to step in those stones. I don™
t know, you know, a lot of times, I™m not 
human, I™m like a piece steel, or a stone, y
ou know, I don™t have no feelings for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
102
nothing. On  the other hand, you 
know, if -- I™m very easy to 
get emotional, too. I think 
it™s a sickness, or it came in the suffer -- 
I don™t know, it™s not normal, you know. I can 
get emotionally depressed. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I try my best, I know that I have to help
 my self. I don™t believe
 in any doctor, or 
any consultation will help something like th
is. The only way how I 
know, is to help 
my self, and just don™t give in, just be stro
ng enough to  fight it, to make you fo rget, 
even if you don™t -- cannot forg et, and you will 
not forget, but talk yourself in that you 
did fo rgot, you have to 
keep on going on living. 
Q: Mm-hm. You know, I read -- I -- I th
ink it was just yesterday I was reading 
different Holocaust materials, and I read th
at some people, survivors, have asked, 
strange though it may seem, to be buried at 
Birkenau. And I wonder if you™ve heard of 
that, and whether -- i -- i-it™s really -- you sp
oke earlier of your -- one of the hardest 

things was coming to term
s with having surviv ed. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: But what is the -- what i -- what i 
-- have you th ought about your own plan s for 
where you™d want to be buried, and -- my  guess would be it™s a -- 
A: I -- I don™t know, everybody can has it™s opinion. 
Q: Sure. 
A: And what -- I will not agree or disagree. 
I think th is is private matter, you know, to 
do how you feel. But personally, I don™t thi
nk, you know, it™s a great idea, something 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061
  
 
 
 
 
103
like this. It™s too much Jewish blood in
 Birkenau, what it will never get over it, 
actually. Still boiling, you know
, because so many people -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- innocent people, kids, men, women, who 
have been so bruta
lly killed, murdered.
