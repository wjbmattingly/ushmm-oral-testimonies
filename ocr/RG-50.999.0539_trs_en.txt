The
 
life stor ies  of Holoc aus t s urvivor s  tr ans c end the dec ades .  What you are about 
to hear  fr om Fanny is  one individual's  ac c ount of the Holoc aus t. We have prepared a brief 
s lide pr es entation to help with her  intr oduction. 
 
And we begin with this  por trait of
 
Fanny and her daughter J os iane taken in 1942.  
Fanny was  bor n Dec em ber
 
3rd, 1916 in Lodz, Poland.  That means  Fanny will tur n 100
 
year s 
old later this  year .  She was  the s ec ond of thr ee daughters born to Benjamin Orenbac h and 

Rivke Leah As pis  Or enbac h.  After her s is ter  Rose's  birth in 1921, the Orenbac hs  m oved with 
their daughters, Ter es e, Fanny and Ros e, to Br uss els , Belgium.  On this map, Belgium  points  

to Brus s els .  Fanny gr aduated fr om c ollege where she studied dr es s making and des ign.  

While working 
as a dr es sm aker for the r
oyal has , Fanny m et J acques Aizenberg.  On May
 
19, 
1938 Fanny and J acques  were m ar ried.  Her e we s ee their  wedding portrait.
 
One year  later on Marc h
 
21, 1939, Fanny gave birth to J os iane.  The following year 
on May
 
10th, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium .  This  picture of J acques, Fanny and J os iane 

2
 
was  taken in 1941.
 
In 1942, Germany began the r oundup of Belgium Jews .  Fanny ar r anged to hide 
J os iane in a Car m elite Convent.  For sec urity reas ons , Fanny was  not told where her daughter 
was
 
hidden.  This  photo of J os iane was  taken inspec t 1941.
 
In Brus s els , Fanny work ed for the underground.  In 1943 s he was  denounc ed and 
s ent to the Malines  trans it c am p in Belgium and then on to Aus c hwitz.  The ar row on this  m ap 
points  to Aus c hwitz.
 
Her e we s ee a doc um ent recently unc over ed in the Inter national Trac ing Ser vic e 
ar c hive lis ting Fanny on the tr ans port lis t fr om Malines  to Ausc hwitz.  She's Number
 
119 whic h 
I know you c an't s ee the num bers.  But Fanny is  Number
 
119, and her profes s ion of 
s eamstres s is  lis ted in Frenc h on the r ight
-
hand s ide.  Here we s ee Fanny's  daughter  J os iane 
being rec ognized for Fanny's  wor k in the Belgian res is tanc e.  This photo was  taken in the fall 

of 1944 after Belgium was  liberated but befor e Fanny was  liberated. 
 
Fanny lives  in the 
m etr opolitanWas hington, D.C. ar ea.  She and her hus band J acques  moved her e in 1983 after  

25
 
year s  in Atlantic  City.  J acques pas s ed away in 1988.  Fanny's daughter, J os iane, lives  
her e her  and is  retired from  her  work as a s oc ial worker  for abus ed c hildren.  J os iane and her 

hus band, Alfred Tr aum , ar e als o Holoc aust s urvivor s .  I'm just delighted to tell you that J os iane

J ewis h teac her fr o

Fanny Aizenber g.
 
( applaus e) .
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: Hello.  Thank  you all for c oming.
 
> > Bill Bens on: You have s o muc h to s hare with us  that we'll just get s tarted r ight aw
ay.  Is 
that okay?
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: Ok ay.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Okay.  Although, Fanny, you wer e bor n in Poland and your family moved to 

Br ussels , Belgium when you were a young child.  You told me you had a wonderful c hildhood.  

Let's begin with you telling us  a little bit about that c hildhood, about your years  befor e the war , 

your  fam ily.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Another thing whic h is  ver y differ ent, lear ning a new language.  I'm ver y 

luc ky.  I volunteer here on Sunday.  And it's wonderful that the major ity of people c ome, want 

to lis ten to us  and hopefully that they are going to have a m uc h, muc h better likelihood.
 
So anyone who has  any questions , pleas e feel fr ee to ask.  And I want to thank  you 
all for  c om ing.
 
> > Bill Bens on: So, Fanny, fir st I want you to tell
 
us , tell us  about your par ents .  Tell us about 

3
 
your  parents and when y ou were a kid.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: It's all diffic ult bec aus e it was  s o many years  ago.  And life all together 

was  different, not only in Am er ic a whic h we didn't know but in Belgium.  I
 
have to tell you 
s om ething in Belgium  whic h has n't happened in any c ountry in the wor ld.  During the war , 

r egardles s of the pain and the wor ry we had, food was  available, people wer e stopped on the 

s tr eet. We wer e told we're going to work but didn't know
 
it was  wor k  in c oncentration c amp.
 
The main thing I have to tell you
 
--
 
and I would lov e to s har e with you, Belgium  is  the 
only c ountry in the whole Eur ope that the c hurc hes , believe it or not, food was  rationed and 

they have been able to save 4,000 J ews  childr en who are alive today thanks to the dedic ation 

of thos e few people.  At the Holoc aus t Mus eum, right here on the fourth floor , there's a 

doc umentary of thos e people.  They have been as ked:  What m ade you sac rific e s o muc h and 
help other people?  The 
only thing they s aid that's  the only thing we c ould do and s hare with 
one another .  I'm  very, ver y luc ky to have the job here as a volunteer and talking to mos tly 

young people.
 
We c annot love eac h other  if we don't r es pec t one another .  And ther e's a lot t
o give 
and to take.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, I'm  going to ask you jus t a few ques tions  about thos e ear ly year s .  You 

went to c ollege.  You bec am e a dr es s mak er.  You landed a job with the royal family.  That was  

a really big deal.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: It's not
 
bec aus e it was  s uc h a big deal.  In Belgium, if you were a good 
s tudent to the fifth gr ade, the r est of your educ ation is  fr ee of c harge.  My par ents would never  

be able to afford a s c holar s hip.
 
> > Bill Bens on: You got m arr ied in 1938.  Tell us  a little bit about your husband J acques who 
you m ar ried in 1938.
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g:Well, Belgium is  a very small c ountry.  And it's not as big as Amer ic a.  
And people live m uc h c los er  with one another.  You have neighbor hoods  lik e you have many 

s m all towns  today.
 
Again, I have to tell you, Belgium  is s till the only c ountry when you think  how 
danger ous  it was  to help s omebody, when I help somebody, jus t to have s omebody s tay 

over night with you or s har e a s andwic h with you.  It's  s o beautiful, the doc um entary, thos e 

people fr om the c hurc hes .  They s aid that's  the only thing we c ould have done and has been 
done.
 
And I have to be ver y, ver y gr ateful.  Thanks to the c hur c hes , I have my c hild who is  
alive today and, of c our se, s he is  an old lady like I am .
 
( laughter).
 
>> 
Bill Bens on: Fanny, I'm going to have you tell us  a few mor e things about that tim e during 
the Holoc aus t with J os iane in hiding.
 
One of the s tor ies  you told m e about J acques that I would like to s har e with the 
audienc e is  that he was  a trained violinis t and he perfor med in m ovie theaters , r ight? 
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: That's how many young people who gr aduated m usic al s c hool got jobs.
 
> > Bill Bens on: And they perform ed m us ic
 
--
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: That's a way of making a living.  Every m ovie hous e had four  o
r  five 
ac c ording to the s ize of the m ovie hous e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: And that was  bec aus e they were s ilent movies , right? 
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Right.
 

4
 
> > Bill Bens on: Yep.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: And then, of c our s e, onc e the talking c ame in, it c ompletely s topped.
  
And just like in Am er ic a, people had to look for jobs .
 
> > Bill Bens on: You had J os iane until 1938.  Germ any and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 
September
 
1939 to begin the war .  Germ any attac ked Belgium  in May
 
1940.  When the 
Germ ans c ame into Belgium, what happened to you and your  fam ily?
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: A big sc are bec aus e Belgium  and Holland
 
--
 
we hav e a m ap that you can 
s ee the two c ountr ies .  Ac c or ding to the law, that's  the Germ any.  There was  no s uc h thing as 

law.  They made the law.  And Belgium was  s uppos ed to remain free c ountr y.  But that didn't 

happen.  The Germ ans oc c upied Belgium.  And right away, it had been s uc h a way of getting 

organized either  hiding som ebody or  helping s omebody with food.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Soon after the Germ ans c ame into Belgium, what did your hus band dec ide to 

do? What did J acques do?
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: Also, at that partic ular time, there was  lots  we didn't k now.  And you 

m ainly wer e in the underground, J ews  and non
-
Jews  wer e together .  There was  no differenc e 
b
etween the two people.  This  is  another thing that helped many, many people to be alive 
today bec aus e of the J ews  and non
-
J ews  wor king together.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, as  I r em ember you telling m e, J acques ans wered the c all fr om the 

Br itis h to join the Royal Air Forc e and he left to go to England to join the Br itis h Arm y, Air 
For c e, you were alone with J osiane in Belgium .
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Yes , bec aus e we didn't know what hell
 
--
 
that's the only word I c ould 
us e
 
--
 
is waiting for  us.  The Ger mans  took s m a
ll dogs  and went ar ound all the neighbor hoods.  
If we're not going to lis ten to the orders , we're going to be punis hed.  And the biggest 

punis hment the Germans star ted to do
 
--
 
don't forget we lived together in a neighborhood, 
J ews  and non
-
J ews .  Ther e was
 
no differ ence of s c hools  or any educ ation bec aus e Belgium 
had two languages at that tim e, French and Flemis h.  At that tim e, many people didn't k now 
what we wer e going to do.
 
Als o, in hiding, anybody that c ould help or s ign up bec aus e we didn't know how b
ad 
the Nazis  and the Germ ans  ar e going to be in Belgium.
 

> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, can you tell us  some of the things  that the Nazis  began doing to the 

J ews  in Bruss els  and other  plac es in Belgium?  You had
 
--
 
had som e point you had to wear  a 
Y ellow S tar.
 
>> 
Fanny Aizenber g: This  is  another s ad thing.  We had all had to wear  a Yellow Star.  That's  
only bec aus e it's yellow or  any other  c olor, but it was  to make us different.  The kids wer e 

growing up together , playing together like one s am e population.  And ano
ther  thing in 
B elgium
 
--
 
and I don't know if any other com panies .  It gives  a s pecial plac e that they had 
phys ic ians  to c heck  your c hild and give that c hild free of c harge food and being c hecked by a 

phys ic ian and m ake s ure ever ything is  ok ay.  Once the Ger mans  c am e in, s omebody els e 

knew to pr event them  to go ther e.  But bes ides all that, the people in the churc hes , namely, 
have or ganized and we didn't know who was  hiding who and who was  who.
 
Like I s ay again
 
--
 
and I cannot s ay it again
 
--
 
thanks to thos e
 
c aring
 
--
 
today ther e 
has  never been a differ enc e between J ews  and non
-
J ews .  And it s hows  y ou, it didn't take 
m oney.  It was  just a way of c ar ing.  And this  is  why I'm very fortunate.  I volunteer here on 

Sunday bec aus e Sunday we have a ver y, ver y large audienc e.  And that helps  m e talk, as you 
c an tell.

( laughter).
 
And it's s o am azing how muc h people go back  hom e and be different kind of 
people, not they are better  or  not s o better but how muc h we have to offer one another  in how 
m uc h we c ould s hare with
 
one another.  And don't forget, food was  r ationed.  And people wer e 
willing to depr ive thems elves , even if it was  only a s andwic h in order to giv e that s andwic h to 
s om eone who didn't have any.
 
> > Bill Bens on: As you wer e telling us a c ouple of m om ents ago
, you c ould go to thes e c linic s  
for healthc are for J os iane
 
--
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Everybody was  entitled to that.  All free of c harge.
 
> > Bill Bens on: And the Nazis  s aid J ews  c ould no longer  go.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Of c ours e not.
 
> > Bill Bens on: So you couldn't get healthcare anymore.
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: And, again, the people in charge of thos e clinic s  were als o willing to help 

at night to r isk  their  own lives .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, you told m e, in 1942, the deportations  began to depor t J ews  out of 
Br u
s s els , out of Belgium.
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: J ust to pick  them  up wherev er  they were.
 
> > Bill Bens on: In 1943, things had gotten s o bad that you m ade this  extr aordinary dec is ion to 
take your  young c hild, J os i, and put her into hiding.  Tell us  what you remember what that was  
like for you.
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: Num ber one, there's no wor ds .  Anybody who has  a c hild or a brother, 
you c ould jus t im agine how the parents  would feel with the c hild not being with you anym or e.  

Another  thing, we didn't know what's  goin
g to happen and the ir ony of not knowing what's  
going to happen to the children.
 
And bes ides  that, the parents  wer e helped by putting the c hild in hiding.  We weren't 
allowed to know wher e they were going to be bec aus e in c as e we would be called, they woul
d 
think  then we would be deported, too.  That was als o
 
--
 
it was  not working.  Ther e wer e gas  
c hamber s and s elec tions.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, onc e you made that dec is ion and J os iane went into hiding, you didn't 

know wher e s he was .  Then you had to go into hiding, too.
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: Yeah, abs olutely.  Bec aus e, other wis e, they would k now im mediately 
wher e we went.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where did you go into hiding?
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: In m any differ ent plac es  in one night.  There was  not s uc h a s ec ure 
plac e. 
 
Unles s you wer e luc ky, you were able to live with the nuns .
 
> > Bill Bens on: With the nuns .
 
And one of the extraordinary things  you did, Fanny, is  you wor ked for the Belgium  
Res is tanc e, the underground.
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: Everybody did.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Ever ybody did.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Everybody did.  You had 5
-
year
-
old kids and they were exchanging 
news letter s  bec aus e we c ouldn't get the news letters  just to s how you the c om bination of the 

people of helping.
 
> > Bill Bens on: How danger ous  was  that to do wo
rk?
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Very dangerous.  Ver y dangerous .  You have 5
-
year
-
old kids and they 

6
 
were the bigges t m ail delivery.
 
> > Bill Bens on: If I r emember r ight, one of the things you would do is  go out at night and pas s  
out.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: That was the only way we c ould do s om ething.
 
Five people had five keys  s o one c ould come with one pers on.
 
> > Bill Bens on: At that time, Fanny, you wer e s till with your m other.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on: And als o in 1943, you and your  mother would be denounc ed by somebody.  

What does  that m ean?
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: That they c are or willing to help others.  Or if they can't, they don't.  On 

the other hand, you had people who were working with the Nazis .
 
> > Bill Bens on: And they denounc ed you.
 

> > Fanny Aizenberg: And they helped denounc e not only us  but m any other people.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When they denounc ed you and your m other, what happened to you then?
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Firs t of all, in or der to get the people together they had one plac e wher e 
m any people c ould get together and live together.  People wer e there about ten days  als o 
working.  And then we would s end 160 people in a tr ain.  By the tim e we all ar rive in 

Aus c hwitz, whic h none of us ever  hear d that name in our lifetim e, 40 people c ame out alive.
  
All the r est wer e dead.  So 160 people.
 
And onc e the 40 cam e out alive, they had a s election.  And that's  how when m y 
m other  went in one s ide and we went to another  s ide.  That was  the las t time I s aw my m other  

ever .
 
After war ds , we have lear ned the horr or s c omm itted to all of us .  The s elec tion of 
people
 
--
 
and now als o a kind of s urger y to babies  and young women after the war  helping 
women to c onc eive.
 
> > Bill Bens on: I might as k  you m ore about that in a c ouple of m inutes .
 
Fanny, the last tim e you s aw your  m om, when your mother  went to the other  s ide, 
what happened to you then?
 

> > Fanny Aizenber g:Well, I s aw m y mother  ther e and I didn't k now what it m eans.  It would be 

eas ier  to be together to help one another .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Of c ourse.
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: The Nazis  would beat you up, you were bleeding.  And they would 

ac c ept it, if that's where they put you, you would s tay.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Before long, they m ade you do ver y har d labor.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: That's what we all did.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did
 
do you? What was  your
 
--
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: The major ity of people who have been in the c onc entr ation cam ps , any 

c ity in Germ any, the main thing they had to do is  m anufacture amm unition.  We had to make 

s m all bombs.  And the bombs  had to be c leaned, whic h we did.
 
We wer e 20
 
hours a day and food only for one hour.  That's when m any people just 
c ollaps ed by the fumes.
 
> > Bill Bens on: The fumes  fr om m aking the am munition.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: And also people jus t had a har d time to r em ain as  hum an beings and
 
they c ould not s on r ec eive anymore.  Ther e was  a c omm unity, and that's  wher e more and 
m or e s c hools  had been helping the people.  And I think  that's  when it started, that people 

7
 
c ould go to s c hool if they qualified, any tr ade.  If som ebody was  not qualified to get a higher 
educ ation, then they went to a paid s c hool.  You had to go
 
--
 
you had to have a back ground.
 
> > Bill B ens on: Right.
 
Fanny, when you went to Aus c hwitz, you rec eived a tattoo.  You were tattooed two 
tim es.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: The reas on why s ome of us have two tattoos , bec aus e we were not 

hum an beings anymore.  We just wer e num bers .  And when they c heck s omebody with the 
s am e number twic e, then they took  us apart and they bur n out.  That's  why I have too 
num ber s.  The m ajor ity of young wom en 
als o have two num ber s .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Two number s .
 
Fanny, when we firs t met, you told m e that the Nazis  tr ied to literally s tr ip from you 
ever y
 
--
 
ever y bit of dignity you had.
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Of c our s e.  Starting m entally.  And this  is  why at the end
 
of the war  in 
'45
 
when the Rus s ians  wer e getting c loser , as a matter of fact thanks to the Rus s ians , we 
bec ame fr ee bec aus e the las t battle was  won by the Rus s ians.
 
And bec aus e of that
 
--
 
whic h was  a very
 
--
 
when you go to s c hool, you bec om e a 
c om m unity. 
 
But that was  the las t war  between the Rus s ians  and the Germ ans .  And that 
m akes them  win the war .  They wer e m ar c hing on the hors es.  And the Rus s ian people were 

the fir s t ones to get the honor to be dec lar ed a free c ountr y.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Fanny, I'm  going to ask you a couple more questions  later about your  

liberation by the Rus s ians .
 
B ut in
 
--
 
you m entioned the m edic al experim ents  s o when you were at Aus c hwitz, 
m edic al experim ents were performed on you, weren't they?
 
> > Fanny Aizenber g: Everybody.  Ther e
 
was  one exper iment, they c alled him the cr azy 
phys ic ian.  His  biggest
 
--
 
I don't know what they call
 
--

they for c ed you out and they sent you on what we c all a death m ar c h.

m eans  people ar e m arc hing for m onths and it was  heavy snow.  So eac h tim e that's  why
 
it 
was  c alled the death m arch bec aus e too m any people had died on that partic ular marc h.

Rus s ians  alm os t won the war  and at
 
night, they were looking to find Nazis  hiding s o they c ould 
c atc h them.  Luckily, becaus e we were s ix wom en together, we didn't have fam ilies , s o we 
bec am e families  bec ause the only hope is  that we would find our fam ily or our c hildren, as  we 
had.

Bens on: You told me in the pas t, Fanny, that you think  that one of the reas ons that you 
were able to s ur vive Auschwitz and the death m arc h was  thinking about your  daughter 
J os iane.

Ravens br uc k .  Tell us  about Ravens bruck .
 
> > Fanny Aizenberg: Ravens bruc k  was  a m uc h sm aller  c onc entr ation cam p than Aus c hwitz.  

Aus c hwitz was  the bigges t c om bination of experim ent thes e would m ake on people.  

Phys ic ians  from all different countr ies cam e there to s tudy how fast they could find ways  of 

killing people.
 
It's  diffic ult, for m e anyway, it's s o diffic ult to im agine that s uc h a c ivilization whic h 
the Germans ar e known to be, their  s c hooling and ever ything, and they could take a baby and 

jus t tear it in two without any r em or se.  And we were lucky that the Russ ians  wer e looking for  

Germ ans.  And that's  wher e they find out. We all had typhus .  Typhus  was  s uc h a c ontagious  
thing that very few young wom en had s urvived it.

have food and we didn't have food.  So every day they went to a farm and they s tole cows  and 
they
 
s har ed that with us .  And that's  what kept us  alive.  Bec aus e many young people who had 
been liberated by the Britis h or  by the Americ ans died r ight away bec aus e their body was n't 
us ed to have normal food, what they c all norm al food today in order to dige

Am er ic an and
 
Br itis h Red Cros s.  And m ost of us had the typhus  whic h was  ver y c ontagious  at 
that partic ular  time bec aus e bodies  wer e not functioning like nor mal bodes.
 
Today, you know, jus t a com bination of evil and how this  was  able to destroy us .  
There is  s o m any,

believe it has n't happened.
 
This  is why I volunteer  here on Sunday bec aus e they have a large group of people,

is  not having a war  and res pec ting one another .

to apply for  Am er ic an c itizens hip, you had to know Englis h.  Now you don't have to

how did the

c hur c hes and other organizations .  It's not I
 
have m or e than you have or you have m or e than I 
had.  That anger, that pain had not c ontinued and with the people who felt like they were in 
your  life and their  fam ilies  not touc hed.

Do we have another  one?  I think  we've got one right there in the m iddle.

the atroc ities that you experienc ed under the hands  of people who, I'll s ay, c all them s elves  
phys i

So my ques tion for  you, after  exper ienc ing that and c om ing back to the world
