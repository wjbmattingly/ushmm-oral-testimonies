USHMM ŒMargaret Lambert  (5-20-96)  

Tape 1 of 4 

 

Q: –name , date of birth.  

 

A: My name  is Margaret Lambert.  I was 
born, a name  that I hate, Gretl, it™s too 
Teutonic.  I hate that na
me  and Gretl Bergma n and I was born April 12, 1914 in a 
very small town in the south of Germany and it was a great life. 
 

Q: And what was the town called? 

 

A: Laupheim. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit about that gr eat life. 

 

A: Well we had all the freedom that we 
needed, could roam around every place, once 
I had a bicycle at the age of 7, I could 
go into the countryside and hunt for frogs 
and snakes and stuff like this and lots of
 friends, mostly non Jewish friends.  We , 
there was a large Jewish community in the town but due to my love for spor ts, 

most of my friends were non Jewish and 
that was never, never, never a problem 
until a certain time of my life. 
 

Q: Tell me  about your fami ly. 
 
A: My father had a terrific sense of humor 
and I think I inherited it from him and he 
had a large factory ma king hair goods, hair 
nets, wigs, one of the, some  of them 

found their way even into the me tropolitan
 opera and my mother was, I don™t 
know she was a little bit of a, a kvetch if you know what that me ans.  She was 

always trying to get our a
ttention by saying oh I have this
 terrible headache and so 
on and so, and I don™t think she was a, sh
e was not a very warm person because 
both I and my, my two brothers we felt 
she was inapproachable but we had a 
good, good time together.  I had a brother who 
was two years older.  Then I got a 
little baby brother when I, he was 12 years younger which embarrassed the heck 

out of me  because I di dn™t think parents s
hould engage in this sort of stuff.  And 
but we were all very good friends.  My 
brother died unfortuna
tely very suddenly 
about 20 years ago on a pleasure trip and 
my younger brother I™m in touch with 
and we have a good, very good relationship. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t your religious background. 
 

A: There was no organize
d religion in my house.  
We ate everything, we did 
everything, we never went to the temple 
except on the high holidays and I hated it 
because I had to wear a hat.  And my fa
ther, he used to say to us, be a decent 

 
 
2

2
huma n being, that should be your religion 
and I think we, he followed that and we 
followed it too.  And religion never meant a
nything to me  and especially after all 
the things that happened late
r on.  If I ever had any religious feelings I think I 
would have lost it pretty fast after a
ll the things that happened to the Jewish 
people. 
 
Q; –did you identify with being a Jew as a girl? 

 

A: Well only in the fact that I was Jewish 
and I had to go to temple twice a year but 
it, it didn™t, it didn™t ma ke any di
fference because nobody cared. I was the only 
girl in my class and I was the only Jew in
 my class and there was never, never an 
unpleasant and you didn™t think of
 yourself as a Jew.  You thought of yourself as 
a German I think. 
 

Q: So you never experienced anti Œ Semiti
c feelings before Hitler arrived on the 
scene? 
 

A: No, I only once I said some  neighbor boy 
called me  a dirty Jew and I beat him up 
and I was never bothered again so that was it. 
 

Q: So the events of 1933 and onward must have come  as a shock to you. 

 

A: It most certainly did.  It was, it was terri
ble.  I mean from one 
day to other, to the 
other there was like a wa ll you know one da
y you were a respected citizen.  The 
next day you were a, a tenth rate citize
n.  You were banned fr om all public places, 
no theatres , no restaurants, no swimmi
ng pools, you couldn™t go any place and 
you could not associate with non- Jewish people. 
 

Q: –your athletic life before 1933. 

 

A: When I was about 6 years old there was 
this little club in the town and you could 
go as often as you wanted in the after
noon or in the evening whoever was ready 
there, the older people help
ed the younger people how to
 do certain things and it 
was great, you just went there.  I co
uld go there un, unescorted because it was 
close to my house and I spent some tim
e there and I was happy as a lark. 
 

Q: What did you do there?  

 

A: Well we did gymnastics, we did runn
ing, we did whatever, whatever you know 
there was a lot of gymnastics involved and 
they worked on the parallel bars which 
I hated.  I hated that stuff because I wa
sn™t good at it because my legs were too 

long I guess.  And but they instructed us 
the older people, and 
there was a terrific 
relationship.  They would take us out 
Sundays to go swimmi ng and it was really 
very nice. 
 

Q: What did you like about sports? 

 
 
3

3
 
A: I just loved it. 

 

Q: You just loved what? 

 

A: I loved everything that had to do with phys
ical activity.  I loved to climb.  I loved 
to run.  I, I just loved, loved to be outdoor
s, it, it was, I skied, I skated, I swa m.  
Nobody ever told me  anything.  I played tennis, I played ping-pong.  Nobody ever 

told me  anything.  It was just, I was a na
tural athlete and whatever I started to do, 
I did well without being inst
ructed in anything so, it was the, I liked it better than 
mathe matics let me tell you. 
 

Q: And you we re good at it. 

 

A: And I was good at it, without
 working very hard at it. 
 

Q: Did sports start playing a very
 significant role
 in your life? 
 

A: Well once I got to be in the age where 
I got to be noticing 
boys it became a very 
important thing in my life because th
at was the social life then, you know you 
went to the gym and uh the boy you had 
your eye on walked you home  and that 
was a big deal and that was very good. 
 

Q: Was sports important in Germany gr owing up? 

 

A: Yes, I think there was hardly the smallest
 little village that didn™t have some  kind 
of sports going.  If it was just a socce
r club, club.  You know they play soccer 
and, and team sports mo re but there 
were very few places where there was 
nothing going on and that was a very importa
nt thing and once I got a little older, 
ma ybe 14 or  so, we used to go to other little towns and compe t e there and that 

was really like a lot of fun and you met alot of new people and, and it was, it was 

great. 
 

Q: Were there a lot of sporting clubs and– 

 

Q: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.  Has nothing to 
do with the school as a ma tter of fact.  I 
think that™s why I hated school so much because whenever I came into school on 

Monday the teachers would ma ke fun of
 me  and say oh you must have ha d a 
tough weekend again.  Maybe you were play
ing field hand ball or some thing and 
why don™t you pay more  attention to your, your
 lessons and I think that turned me  
off more than anything else and I turned mo
re to sports then instead of less, the 

way I thought I would. 
 

(Technical interruption) 

 

Q: –a future in athletics, in
 terms of Olympic compe tition. 

 
 
4

4
 
A: I don™t believe so at that time.  That cam
e much later really.  But when I was quite 
small, maybe 10, 12 years old, I had ma
de up my mi nd, I will be a physical 
education teacher or a coach.  And I knew exactly where to go in Berlin and study 

there and it didn™t work out that way b
ecause by the time I was ready for it, I 
wasn™t accepted anymore but uh I always wanted to be in sports. 
 

Q: Not necessarily competitivel y but– 

 

A: No, just teaching and coaching and y
ou know later on once I got too old to do it 
myself. 
 

Q: So you weren™t thinking about
 comp etitions and Olympics– 

 

A: Well, I, I don™t think that I really tho
ught about the Olympics.  I don™t even think I 
knew much about the Olympics.  You know we
 lived in this small hick town that 
did have a newspaper but I think it was mo
re important to see that the chickens 
laid the eggs or whatever than you know a
ll they would report the sports results of 
what happened in that town.  But nothing 
really you didn™t, you didn™t get much 
information.  There wasn™t any television 
of course and the radio came much later 
so I don™t think that I knew
 much about the Olympics 
until I got a lot later. 
 

Q: –and the radio came later. 

 

A: There was no, was no television, of cour
se, no television whatsoever.  And radio 
also came you know it wasn™t there when I was very small. 
 

Q: There was nothing different at that
 stage about being 
a Jewish athlete? 
 

A: None whatsoever.  I™ve said this so
 many times that there was absolutely no 
difference between the Jewish people and th
e gentile people. There were not that 
ma ny Jewish people doing sports, let™s face 
it and especially not girls.  But I 
never, never felt any, any different.  I 
mean we would go Sundays go to a nice 
swimming hole and go swi mmi ng and very
 often was the only Jewish person 
going so there was nothing.  I felt perfectly comf ortable. 
 

Q: Were your parents or your
 brothers athletic also? 

 

A: No.  No, nobody, nobody I don™t know where I 
got it from, I really don™t.  But my 
brothers liked to watch it but they, they
 didn™t do much by themselves, I mean my 
brother, my oldest brother skied a little 
bit but nothing very, no
t like I.  I mean I 
was possessed I think by sports. 
 

Q: You started to talk about when thi
ngs began changing for you as a young athlete 
and I™d like you to talk about that a little bit more– 
 

 
 
5

5
A: In the spring of 1933, it was just aro
und my birthday and it was not a very nice 
birthday present, I got a letter from
 my sports club, you are no longer we lcome 
here because you™re Jewish.  Heil Hitler and th
at was the end of that.  So they just 
threw me  out of the club and that was the e
nd of my sports career as far as that 
was concerned.  There wa s no Jewish sports
 per se in the town because everything 
was always mi xed up you know
.  There was everybody did things together.   But 
we, we were just locked out of everythi
ng.  All the Jews were thrown out of the 
sports club.  All the Jews, you couldn™t go t
o, to a restaurant.  I mean Jews were 
excluded from all Germa n life.  That st
arted in 1933 and it was a horrible time .  
There was one Jewish restaurant in, i
n, in that town and everybody congregated 
there and everybody commiserated you know.  
What are we going to do, what™s 
going to happen here.  And it was a horrible life. 
 

Q: Was any of this anticipate
d, did you know much about Hitler? 
 

A: I don™t think it was anticipated in the 
realm the way it happened.  Um onc e he 
started, you know became chancellor– 
 

Q: –sayonceHitler– 

 

A: Once Hitler became chance
llor you started to worry a little bit you know but 
everybody thought this is, this is going to bl
ow over, he™s not going to last.  As a 
ma tter of fac t , I had been accepted at th
e University for physical education in 
Berlin.  For the spring seme ster and I wrote 
them a letter saying that I was Jewish 
and would it be advisable for me  to come  
just then.  And they wrote me  a letter 
back literally saying wait until this thi
ng blows over so everybody thought this is 
not going to last.  But once Hitler had 
you know taken hold you were just afraid 
for your life if you, if you disobeyed or wh
ether it was a Jew or whether it was a 
gentile, you did exactly as you were 
told, like in a real dictatorship. 
 

Q: –how your life changed–life for a teenaged girl– 

 

A: It was a terrible, terrible time.  
It was, it was almo st, you couldn™t understand, 
why did this happen, why aren™t those pe
ople associating with us any mo re.  I 
mean some  of the friends stayed with us
 you know.  But only in a. a very in a way 
they couldn™t be caught to come  to our 
house for instance.  They had to come  in 
the mi ddle of the night and sneak in the back
 door if they wanted to visit with us.  
But a lot of them did change that, you know they went the other way and they 

figured well ma ybe Hitler is out god fr om 
now on and we will stay with him but it 
was, it was very bad.  We didn™t know 
what to do with ourselves, you couldn™t go 
anywheres.  You couldn™t go into a restau
rant, you couldn™t go into a movie and 
especially in a small tow
n.  In a large town I guess you could bear to go to a 
movie every once in a while or a restaurant but not in a small town.  Everybody 

knew everybody else and, and you just didn™
t do it and if you did it, I™m sure, you 
would be punished according to
 Hitler™s credo, whatever.

Q: Did you feel betrayed by friends– 
 

A: Yes, some  of them.  There was a girl 
next door to me , we grew up together as 
babies.  We  were together every single 
day.  She ate in our house more times than 
she ate in her own house and soon as Hitle
r came in she didn™t know me any more 
and that was it.  She had the chance to 
sneak into the house ju
st like anybody else, 
you know other friends did.  But she never made that attempt and maybe 2 years 

ago she wrote me  a letter, the first time  I ever heard from her.  My dear, darling 

you know stuff like this and I™m so happy 
to finally find your address and the 
good times we had together and stuff like this
.  And I wrote her back.  I said yes it 
was a good time  but you didn™t think so 
then because you didn™t know me  any 
more.  That was the end of that friendship. 
 

(techni cal adjustme nt) 

 

Q: –how life changed in ™33, give me  
a picture of what that was like– 
 

A: It is absolutely impossible for anybody 
who hasn™t gone through this what it was 
like to be among friends one day and th
e next day you would pass that same  
friend in the street and you wouldn™t even say hello to each other because you 

were not, some  you were not allowed to do 
it.  Or  some were afraid to do it but 

you just passed your friends up, friend or
 walk right on.  And for instance, my 
younger brother is 12 years younger than I 
and he had all the kids from the 
neighborhood were his friends.  They played
 together all non Jewish children and 
they all played together a
nd all of a sudden after 1933 th
ey started to beat him up 
and on his way to school, he had to go
 to a Jewish school because the other 
schools would not take him and on the way 
to school they beat him up.  And I 
would walk him to school as often as I could.  And they wouldn™t beat him up 

when I was there but they would call him 
and me  all kinds of horrible name s and 
they would spit at us.  And I wouldn™t dare to touch those children because if I 

had touched a non Jewish child I would ha
ve been in a concentration camp the 
next day.  So we really vegetated, th
ere was nothing to do except worrying that, 
what™s going to happen.  My brother wa
s working for a universal pictures and 
they had a, a studio in Berlin. 
 

Q: Your older brother? 

 

A: My older brother and they closed up b
ecause they saw what was comi ng, and they 
closed up and he came home because there was nothing for him to do.  So he 

started to work in, in my father™s fa
ctory.  You know try to do ma ke hims elf 

useful there because there was, he 
couldn™t find a job of course, nobody would 
employ you.  Gentile people were not allo
wed to, to but in Je wish stores for 
instance.  If some body got caught doing that
 they would take their pictures and 
hang them up at the city hall.  I mean th
ey really meant business.  You know they 
were absolutely excluded from everything.

Q: As a fa mily did you talk about th
is, did you try to ma
ke sense of it? 
 
A: I don™t remember that reall
y.  I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you 
know everybody was worrying on their own but
 I don™t think it was discussed all 
that much until I finally decided that th
is was no life, you know so, in from the 
spring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I 

can™t live like this.  And I, 
I decided to go to England then and my parents agreed 
to it that I would go to England becaus
e it was a life of just vegetating. And 
talking about the same  thing over, what 
is going to happen to us.  Talking the 
same  thing over and over again and not to come  to any result. I mean nobody 

would know, knew what, what was going to happen. 
 

Q: In this period then did you essent
ially have to give up your athletics? 
 

A: Oh yes we did try to straighten out 
an old potato acre, that some body had given 
us, one of our Jewish families there.  And we, we ran there and I star ted a fi eld 

hand ball, which is the same  as foot
ball except it™s like 
a combination of 
basketball and, and football.  And I coach
ed them and it takes in 11 people I 
think.  I was the only girl on the team and 
I shot the only goal 
the first time  we, 
we lost 7 to 1 and I shot the only goal.
  But after a while everybody got tired of 
this, you know the same  people every day.  
It, it was horrible, that was they had 
an orchestra there, I mean
 there were ma ny Jewish pe
ople who played the violin 
and, we, we played a little music but th
ere really wasn™t anything to do, so. 
 

Q: And your father was able to rema in in business? 

 
A: For a time being, yes.  Because he did a lot of business with the United States and 
England. 
 
Q: Can you say my father– 

 

A: My father did a lot of business with
 England and the United States and the 
Germans de sperately the foreign currency 
to come  in so they were already 
preparing for the war effort I suppose and 
that™s why the, they left him on for a 
while but then after several 
years, he was just like a 
figurehead on there.  And the 
Nazis took over and but he couldn™t leave 
because they took passport away so he 
was stuck until a certain time came wh
en he was able to, to get out. 
 

Q: You said that you had decided that you 
wanted to go to England, this was just you 
alone? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit about that pl ease. 

 

 
 
8

8
A: Um, I couldn™t stand the life that we 
had and my brother was working in my 
father™s business but I had nothing to do 
you know.  And my mother tried to teach 
me  how to be a housewife, you know c
ooking and washing and ironing.  That 
wasn™t my deal so I decided or my pa
rents decided I would go to England and 

find a school comparable to the one in Berl
in that didn™t take me  and that™s where 
I went in, I think it was in October of 1933. 
 

Q: How did that pan out? 

 

A: I, it was OK, it was, it was a very weird time  too.  I mean I was very friendly with 
the girls in school.   I couldn™t find a sc
hool that I wanted 
to go to, a physical 
education so I went to school to learn 
English.  I fi gured you know better than 

nothing and it was OK. They had a, a trac
k program that they imme diately took 
me into it and I competed for them and w
on everything in sight, whatever I did.  

You know whether it was running or jumping 
or discus or whatever it wa s. And in 
the school I was a big shot.  However um
 what was very odd. I was very friendly 
with the girls in you know some  of t he 
girls.  I wa s never once invited to 
anybody™s house.  Now why I do not know.  Maybe I was considered German.  

Maybe they, I was some how discrimi nated ag
ainst even though I tried to get away 
from discrimi nation when I went to E
ngland but some how I was discrimi nated 

against.  I mean when foreigners came
 to, to Laupheim, we made these people 
comfortable and they were our friends, 
that they came  to our house.  Not in 
England, not once in 9 months, 10 months
, 11 months was I allowed to, was I 
invited into anybody™s house.  That really hurt. 
 

Q: Were there other Jews in the school? 
 
A: I™m sure there were but then again I 
didn™t pay much attention to it you know.  I 
did not seek out other Jews to be my frie
nds.  I wa s just friendly with all the kids. 
 

Q: So you competed you ke
pt up our athletics? 
 

A: Yes and it wa s heaven, it was heaven.  It
 wasn™t much of a program they had in 
school but it was nice to be back to 
you know they only did it, no they did it 
outdoors too.  And then in, in June
 of 1934, I competed in the British 

championships and I won and that wa s a really big deal because then already I felt 

like it was so satisfying to me to win this
, you know and I was sure this would be 
known in Germany and it was like a revenge kind of thing you know.  There you 

see, I am a Jew but I have won the Britis
h championship so I was really very, very 
happy about that. 
 

Q: In what events were you– 

 

A: High jumping, that was m
y, my big event, highjumpi
ng, thanks to my long legs 
and my big feet, I suppose.  I had great su
ccess in it and it was 
very interesting.  
My English was atrocious of course, yeah. 
 And the other girls didn™t bother much 

 
 
9

with me  because I was an outsider so it wa
s kind of lonely but it didn™t matter.  I 
won and that was my father came over. 
 

(End tape) 

 

Q: –to backtrack–alternative outlets– 

 

A: We made our own alternative outlets. We tr
ied of course I was being in the torn in 
the direction of sports, as I said before, 
we played music and we
 tried to entert ain 
ourselves as well as we could.  But sports
 for me  of course was the, the thing I 
wanted the most.  So a farmer let us have
 an old potato field a
nd we tried to ma ke 
it smooth, you know it™s very rough, you know bi
g clumps on there and we tried 
to, to smooth it out and we started our ow
n Jewish hand ball team on there, hand 
ball is a game  like soccer except that you don™
t kick the ball.  You dribble it like a 
basketball and you pass it you know throwing 
it and it™s a great game .  And I 
coached all the fellows on the team and I 
was the only girl on the team and I shot 
the only goal in the fi rst time when we lost 
7 to 1.  And we also tried to straighten 
out, next to the Jewish school there was a, 
a yard and we tried 
to straighten that 
out to do calistheni cs on it.  Because the 
soccer field was a, the handball field was 
a little bit out of the way so we tried to st
raighten that out but 
we had to fight the 
teachers™ chickens and they used that sa
me place for thei r activities and it was not 
very appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast. 
 

(Technical adjustme nt) 

 

Q: Were there Jewish sporting clubs? 
 
A: There were Jewish sporting clubs.  Maccab
ee they called it, but it was a Zionistic 
outfit and it was like the National League 
and the American League in baseball.  
They didn™t get along with, w
ith the other Jewish athlet
es so they, they called 
them the RFJ was people who fought in the 
first world war, they, they were the 
veterans they started this club for athletic
s and they were able in some  towns to 
rent or even buy I don™t know stadiums 
where Jews could, could practice on but 
the facilities were pretty poor
, pretty terrible but as I sa
id we tried to do as much 
as we could to entertain ourselves 
and there was no, no co
ach capable of, you 
know anybody who was a little bit more of 
advanced like I wa s to tell me  what, 
how to do it and what to do and it 
was just a very, very bad time. 
 

Q: Jewish clubs, were they already in oper
ation or we re they formed in reaction?  
 

A: I think they were mostly formed after 
the, as I said the Maccabee, they were 
for med before already but the uh, veterans
 of foreign wars I think they called 
themselves, that, that came a fterwards
.  You know in all the towns almost  

especially in the bigger towns, they, they
 start a move me nt so Jews would have a 
place to go to and and, and do sports. 
 

 
 
10

10
Q: What kind of facilities were they? 
 

A: Poor, mostly pretty poor, you know I th
ink they only let you, the Germans would 
not give you anything very good.  They le
t you have the, the garbage places, you 
know that nobody else wanted most likely, 
that™s what they gave the Jewish 
people. 
 

Q: So this made it di ffi cult for the Jewi
sh athletes to real
ly improve or be 
competitive? 
 

A: Oh yes. Oh yes. I mean it was, it was very bad to, to really achieve some thing 
spectacular because it wa s just, it™s it 
was a poor condition and no coaching. That 
was, that was, that was bad too. 
 

Q: –jump forward to England–British National Championships. 

 

A: Well the day I won the British championshi
p, as I said that was a fabulous day for 
me .  
 

Q: –don™t say as I said. 

 

A: OK.  The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because 
I felt such pride in myself that I was able
 to do that because the Germans had told 
me  I™ m infer i or, I™m no good, you know.  And all of a sudden here I am the 

British champion, champion.  And I was 
hoping that some how word would go 
back to Germany so they would find out that I did this.  And my father had come  
over to watch me , I thought.  I thought he, th
at was the reason for his trip, trip to 
watch me  compete but on the way back from the stadium, we found out 
differently.  My, he didn™t tell me  right aw
ay.  He waited until we got back to his 
hotel.  But on the way back there, there were news papers being hawked in the 

street and everything seemed like to be bi
g exciteme nt.  We  a sked the taxi driver 
what™s going on.  And he said has some th
ing to do with the Nazis killing each 
other off.  So we stopped the taxi and we
 got out, got the newspaper and it told the 
story about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his 

Nazi people because they, they complain
ed about something and he wanted to 
show you. You just didn™t do that.  You 
did as you were told and when we 
thought that this mi ght have been the be
ginning of the end for Hitler we couldn™t 
have been more wrong because Hitler 
by killing off these people let everybody 
know if you want to stay aliv
e, don™t be a hero.  So we
 got to the hotel (clears 
throat) excuse me .  And there my father fi
nally told me  that I had to go back to 
Germany and the reason he could not write 
to me  or tell me  on the telephone was 
because there was this strict censorshi p of everythi ng comi ng into Germany or 

going out of Germany.  And he couldn™t have
 dared to tell me that unless I came 
back the family was being threatened you 
know.  Tell her to come  back or else.  
So of course I decided immediately to 
go home, especially 
in view of wh at 
happened to Hitler™s pals.  If he can kill of his own people, what is he  going to, to 

 
 
11

a Jew who says no.  And I went back, I think within a week I was back in 
Germany which was very, very hard to accept.  I was supposed to be a me mber of 

the German Olympic team and that wa
s some thing I couldn™t understand and 

didn™t understand for a very long time.  I 
think I didn™t understa
nd it until I came  
over here and saw all the newspaper arti
cles that had been written about my 
involveme nt with this time .  The onl y reason I wa s supposed to be on that 

Olympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a 

lot of the other nations threatened not 
to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the 
discri mi nation of the Jews.  And Hitler wanted to ma ke this the best  Olympics 

ever.  He used it as a propaganda vehicl
e, and he wanted of course the United 
States and all the big nations to be there.
  And this was the, the ruse that  they 
used.  I was the pigeon to help him get 
the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin.  
They were already ma king, building a
nd change, you know making a stadium and 
everything but they were really afraid
 that the, that it would not be a good 
Olympics for them because the bi g nations weren™ t going to show up and that 

would take away from the, from the, from
 the game s of course.  So that™s how I 
got on the German Olympic team and it was tough. 
 

Q: How did your father get this informa
tion that they wanted you to come  back? 
 

A: Well that was, it was very peculiar.  My father told me at the time, the way he had 
to come  to England to tell me  a pe
rson.  Some body showed up at our house in 
Laupheim to tell him that he also couldnot write to my father that the fami ly 

would be in, in danger if I didn™t come bac
k.  So if this ma n traveled to Laupheim, 
told my father, my father 
traveled to England, told me
 and that was alike a relay 
race you know.  Avoiding danger. 
 

Q: –did you know that you were going to fill a symbolic role? 

 

A: No but I knew that I woul d be the only Jew because there were nobody else.  I 
mean it sounds kind of conceited but ther
e really wasn™t another 100% Jewish 
athlete who could have competed in
 the Olympics.  And you know having a 
chance to win a me dal.  They just we re
n™t, weren™t good enough.  I mean that™s, 
that™s, that ™s the way it was. 
 

Q: InGermany ?  

 

A: In Germany.  And I didn™t know that I 
was going, at first th
at I was going to be 
the only one.  And in Germany nobody knew anything about this.  This was 

strictly nothing was in the papers about th
is.  That they were, that the Olympics 
weren™t such good shape.  No they only hear
d the Olympics is going to be the best 
thing you ever experienced in Germany and 
all this stuff and there was nothing in 
the papers that there was a danger that 
it wouldn™t be, that 
it would be a flop. 
 

Q: Do you remember the reaction of the German community to your comi ng back? 

 

 
 
12

12
A: Um I think that the Jewish community, th
ey were very proud of
 me .   I  me a n  a f t e r  
a while word spread around that this Jewi
sh girl who mi ght be competing in the 
Olympics and of course I was like the br
ight Jewish hope you know that the, the 
great white hope and this boxer whoever he 
was, I was the great Jewish hope and 
I mean people were proud of me  and the 
they wished me  the best and it wa s a 
terrible time for me  because they would, 
I would be asked a
ll these ridiculous 
questions.  Are you going to be competing 
in the Olympics, and aren™t. What are 
you going to do and how are you going to, to conduct yourself.  I said I don™t 
know.  I mean how do I know what™s going to 
happen.  I™ll just have to play it by 
ear and that™s exactly what I di d. 
 

Q: Did you think that you would go forward a
nd participate in the Olympics at this 
stage? 
 

A: Well ma ybe I was hoping for it in 
a way and ma ybe I was hoping for it. 
 

Q: I need you to say– 

 

A: Oh yes, I am sorry.  In a way I was hopi
ng I would be in the Olympics because to 
compete in the Olympics is the thrill of 
a lifetime.  I mean it and it doesn™t happen 

to everybody, you know you have to be good enough to do it.  On the other hand I 

was so afraid.  Supposing I am allowed to compete, supposing I win and I was 

convinced that I would win a me dal a
nd possibly the gold.  Supposing I do this, 
what, what do I do.  I™m going to st and on that podium and, and say Heil Hitler 

like all the others, I mean that, that wa
s the accepted way to, to say well I won, 
you know you had to stand up there and say He
il Hitler.  I was scared stiff and 
this was going around in my head day and 
night, day and night, day and night.  
How I™ll, what™s going to happen, am I going to compete, am I not going to 

compete?   How do I (clears throat) conduc
t myself if I do compete.  It wa s a 
terrible. 
 

Q: You were very conflicted about this. 

 

A: Oh yes.  I was so, so torn up about it,
 I didn™t know what to do and it was not only 
that but I mean I met with the other gi rls, you know not Jewish competition or so.  

I was always afraid how are they going to 
react to me  and at the Olympic training 
courses that I was ordered to attend, they, 
they couldn™t have been any nicer.  All 
the girls accepted me fully.  No anti Œ Se
mitism.  Nothing I mean I was just an 
athlete like all the other at
hletes and I wrote ma ny, ma ny 
years later, I mean after 
1980 I wrote to one of them.  I said I can™t understand why you were so nice to 

me .  Did you really know I was Jewish.  A
nd she wrote back to me , sure we knew 
you were Jewish but you were an, a good 
athlete like we were good athletes and 
that was all that counted to
 us and politics didn™t mean anything to us, she said in 
the letter.  But I™m sure that she as we
ll as ma ny of the other girls were members 

of the Nazi party.  I mean there is th
is conflict again.  Y
ou know they™re Nazis 

 
 
13

13
and still they, they accept me the Jewish 
girl, doesn™t ma ke any sense, it didn™t 
ma ke any sense. 
 

(Water break) 

 

Q: So you came back to Germany–training and preparation– 

 

A: When I got back to Germany I was hopi
ng I would at least have a place where I 
could train.  But the fact that I was a 
me mber of the German Olympic team did 
not allow me to use any of the stadiums.  I was still a Jew and was not allowed to 

use any of this.  So I had to use the poor 
facilities of the Jewi
sh clubs and compete 
there for them.  And that was, was absolute
ly terrible because fi
rst of all there was 
no competition whatsoever.  If you don™t have any competition it™s, you have to 

only fight yourself and that™s much ha
rder than some body you know if there™s 
stiff competition you try to outdo each ot
her.  But when there™s no competition 
it™s very hard so I always had to fight 
myself and it was really very, very tough.  
And then of course all those stupid qu
estions I have to answer.  You know 
everybody asked me  are you going to be in the Olympics.  You know wha t  are 

you going to do.  I was a nervous wreck I th
ink and day and night, things were on 
my mi nd.  It was really horrible.  A
nd my parents and I we didn™t discuss it 
because I knew they were worried about
 it and they knew I was worried about it 
so we didn™t talk about it.  Because 
we, we didn™t want to hurt each other™s 

feelings I suppose so it, it was very, very hard. 
 

Q: How does one train for the Olympics 
if you™re not on the same playing field– 
 
A: I was ordered three times, four times in
 those two years to go to an Olympic 
training course and that™s the only solid 
training I had for the Olympics and as I 
said before, I think I said it before that  I 
was a natural athlete and if I hadn™t been 
a, a natural athlete I don™t think I woul
d have achieved what I did because there 
just wasn™t any, any opportunity for me , for me
 to, to get better or to advance or to 
know what I was doing, it just happened naturally. 
 
Q: –if there had been good Jewish athletes
–they wouldn™t have had an opportunity 
to progress and be compe titive with th
e German athletes.  Is that true? 
 

A: There were very few Jewi
sh athletes who really were capable to compete on a 
national level.  I mean there were, the be
st Jewish athletes 
let™s say, but they 
weren™t the best German athletes.  And th
ey really, really co
ul dn™t compare, they 
were very, very few and there were some
 for instance in the Olympics, there was 
a fencer Helena Myer, she was half Jewi sh, they let her compete, I guess half 

Jewish was only half as offensive as bei
ng all Jewish.  And there were some  half 
Jewish athletes that competed--one in, in 
ice hockey so he, he me lted into the, you 

know into the team so he wouldn™t stick 
out like I would have stuck out.  But I 
don™t think there were any Jewish athlet
es really that were capable of be, 
competing on, on a national level. 

 
 
14

14
 
Q: –the backing to get better. 

 

A: No, the, the Germans di d another number.  They you know every time  there were 
some newspaper ar ticles written  that  they
™re not holding up their end of our, that 
they finally signed a commit ment that they
 would not discrimi nate against Jewish 
athletes.  They, they wrote it down and but
 there were all these newspaper articles 
that they were not living up to thei r 
co mmitment, that they wouldn™t let me 
compete in the German national championship.  And they said well she wa s not 

entitled to compete in that because she wa
s not a me mber of the German track and 
field association.  And why wasn™t I me
mber, because I was Jewish.  And so you 
know it was like a dog chasing it™s tail.  And 
so it, they had, they had all kinds of, 

of, of ways to talk thems e
lves out of it.  They for 
instance, in 1935 for instance 
they got a little scared again so they 
called all the best Jewish athletes for a 

training course, an Olympic tr
aining course.  I said in
 an article once, I think 
Snow White and the seven dwarfs would have
 done just as well 
as those athletes 
because they weren™t any good.  I happened 
to meet my husband there, that was 
the best part about this training course
, really.  But they really weren™t good 
enough but it was just a sham by, by t he Ge
rmans to show well we, we™re trying 
to find new talent for the Olympics in th
e Jewish community but it, that wa s all 
baloney. 
 

Q: Did you learn anything there– 

 

A: Well there was a very g
ood coach there and but I think what he told me  I knew 
already, you know by then this is 1935 
already and the Olympics were the 
following year and I did very well all along 
and in the training courses I always 
outdid the, my the other you know in, in not 
the Jewish one but in
 the other one.  I 
always did better than, than the other, 
than the German girls and whenever I 
competed which only happened three times I th
ink in the, in the 2 years, I always 
beat them.  Even though I only once did 
I have good competition, girls that were 
also going into the Olympics.  The other 
times I think I jumped about 15 inches 
higher than the next best  and you know th
ere was no, I had no competition in that 
respect and in the Jewish competitions also.  But the, the Germans always kept an 

eye out.  Wh enever I was competing 
someplace, there was always somebody 
watching out, for the, for the Nazis to ma
ke sure if I did poorly, they would have 
kicked me  off the team i mmediately I™m sure. 
 

Q: –equanimity from the officials and from the coaches. 

 

A: The coaches treated me  very well, I 
mean they saw and listen not everybody was 
a, was a Nazi you know.  And that they trea
ted me  very well and they liked me  it 

seems but the officials whenever I had to compete at the, at, they were, they were 

hostile, I think they were hostile towa rd
s me .  At  one time I saw this fellow who 
was a me mber of my for mer club.  I kne
w him as  well as I know myself.  He 
looked through me  like I didn™
t exist.  He didn™t say he
llo.  He didn™t, you know I 

 
 
15

15
was just not, non Œ existent.  And at th
at competition they tried, I mean the 
officials are supposed to be neutral.  They
 tried to teach the ot her gi rls how to you 
know, how they could beat me .  They di
dn™t do that, of course, they couldn™t 
because they weren™t good enough. 
 
Q: That must have been hurtful. 

 

A: Yes, but it, it made me better because 
I was so full of rage, the madder I got, the 
better I jumped and the Germans di dn™t know 
that of course, otherwise they mi ght 
have treated me a little better.  But I was so, so absolutely enraged about 

everything, you know, the whole, the whole 
thing these whole two years that I, 
the madder I got, the better I did.  
And that was, that was wonderful. 
 

Q: So rage was your motivator. 

 

A: Rage was my fuel.  You know fueled my 
energies.  And my motivator.  It was, it 
was, it was, it was really weird. 
 

Q: Took you on to new heights. 

 

A: Unhhunh. 

 

Q: –was there a qualifying process? 

 

A: Well for instance the um German track and field championships, they were 
supposed to be one of the events that w
ould show who was going to be taken into 
consideration for the Olympics but they 
wouldn™t let me  compete  because it™s, I 
was not a member of the  German track
 and field association so I couldn™t 
compete, but they, they, they at one time  
I, I had to compete in Munich which was 
the scariest thing because  Munich wa s the 
hot bed of, of Nazism
.  That was where 
Hitler lived there and I was scared stiff to go there and I didn™t  do that  well and it 

was noted, duly noted by the Nazis that 
I only jumped a, a 
meter 53 instead of 
better but I beat still, beat the competit
ion by about 15 inches.  But I didn™t do as 
well because I think I was mentally a wreck at the time. 
 

Q: Were there other qualifying matches? 

 

A: The gentile com, the gentile girls who 
were supposed to go into the Olympics 
they had thei r own meets which I was not, not admitted and I think the whole deal  

was just if I did fairly well they wouldnot throw me  out because they were still 

afraid that the boycott would happen so I 
think no ma tter what I did, I was pretty 
safe at that point, even the, you know in
 Munich when I did not do too well, they 
couldn™t, they couldn™t afford to throw me  
out at that point becau
se they were still 
afraid the Americans wouldn™t show up. 
 

Q: You just assume d you were goi
ng to be on the Olympic team. 

 
 
16

16
 
A: Yes, I think so.  I think that I was go
ing, be safe then until further notice and I 
didn™t know was I going to be, wasn™t I goi
ng to be, what was I going to do.  It 
was a terr ible time. 
 

(Tape change ) 

 

Q: –when you came back from England you were able to go to some  school? 

 

A: When I came back from England I went 
to Stuttgart a couple 
of times during the 
month, because there the Jewish club had 
a stadium and they had invited me  to 

come  and us e that stadium so I happened 
to learn about a school, a not a Jewish 
school it was a gentile owned school that
 for physical education, it was a private 
school, not a university.  And 
I thought I™ll, I™ll apply a
nd see if they take me , 
fine.  If they don™t take me  fine too and 
they did take me because they mi ght have 
got, they, they had to get pe
rmission from the government
 that they could accept a 
Jew and I suppose that it was all in view
 of my be ing an Olympic candidate and 
had they not let me  go into that school,
 it mi ght have come  out into the other 
countries and there mi ght have been mo
re, more problems for, for, for the 
Olympics for Germany.  So they accepted me and it, I had a good time there, we 

were all very friendly, the girls were all 
very friendly there and it was a big town 
and I could go in the afternoon after they
 were finished practicing we would go 
into this café and ma ke pigs out of 
ourselves, eating whipped cream cake and 
everything and we had a terrific time  ther
e.  And we were very friendly and it was 
nice.  The only thing they would, they would prevent me , they, the curriculum had 

in it German gymnastics and they wouldn™
t let me take part in the German 
gymnastics, now why I don™t know.  Because
 the Jew and the German gymnastics 
that was too, too much of a paradox I don™
t know.  But the other girls, we just 

laughed about it.  We  thought it was funny and by then I was so used to being 

excluded that it wasn™t such a big deal. 
 

Q: You were going to the café and hanging out? 

 

A: Yes, it was good, it was good, it was, you know, the big time , in s big town you 
could do mo re things, you could go to th
e movies and we did do a foolish thing 
one time with these, with these gi rls.  
There were some , we were having a lot of 
good times and laughing and carrying on and a
bout six of us and there was a table 
full of SS uni, uniformed SS me n at the next
 table and they kept looking at us and 

looking at us.  Finally they came over and th
ey tried to ma ke dates with us.  And 
there™s this big German blond guy trying to 
ma ke a date with me  and I said no and 
I said no.  And the more he tried to ma ke a date with me  the more the other girls 

laughed and we got hysterical.  And it 
was, it was funny and it was stupid at the 
same  ti me  cause had I been found out, I 
don™t know what would ha, what would 
have happened to me .  But we were
 young and you didn™t really you know think 
of any consequences that much. 
 

 
 
17

17
Q: –Germans tried to sani tize anti Œ Semitism–apparent to you at all in Germany? 
 

A: I didn™t really see these si gns until, these anti Œ Semitic signs.  I mean I knew I 
was excluded from all public pl aces but I don™t think I saw ever any signs because 

I just didn™t pay any attenti
on to it, I suppose.  I only 
noticed those in 1937 but I 
know that Brundage the, the head of th
e American Olympic committee went over 
to Germany to see what was going on because here was so much resistance in 

America against taking part in the Olympics
 so he went over there and I read later 
on doing some  research that Berlin was 
ma nicured terrifically, everything was 
clean, every, all the offendi
ng signs, dogs and Jews not 
allowed etcetera, etceter a, 
they were all gone and Mr. Brundage was 
not a champion for Jewish causes as I 
have heard, never spoke to any Jewish peopl
e, he just let hims elf be lulled into 
some  false sense of security by these Nazi
s saying everything is fine, we™re doing 
everything we said we would do and he cam
e back to the United States and said 
everything is fabulous over there and we™ll be going. 
  

 

Q: You were aware of efforts in othe
r countries to boycott the Olympics? 
 

A: Not at that time.  

 

Q: Say you heard it after. 

 

A: Yes, I was not, I was 
not aware of it at all. 
 

Q: Prior to the Olympics was there 
some qualifying meet in Stuttgart? 
 

A: Yes, after, after the– 

 

Q: –school in Stuttgart–afford you oppor
tunity to get ready for the Olympics? 
 

A: The school was very nice because I was 
able to do as much as I wanted to in 
sports.  I, you know my, my body wa s reacti
ng at the first, first few weeks I was a 
complete wreck because my body wa sn™t used
 to this kind of being used so much 

but after a while I got you 
know my muscles gotsupple, 
supple again and it was, 
it was great to be back into every da
y, being into sports.  We  had, we had 
gymnastics, we had track a
nd field.  We played you know 
team sports.  It was, it 
was very nice and the first day I was s
cared stiff because I didn™t know how the 
girls would react to me  a nd they greeted
 me , wha t ™s your na me.  My name  is 
Bergma n.  OK you™re Bergie from now on a
nd, and, and we were all the best of 
friends, it was really very nice. 
 

Q: Were these facilities comparable to wh
at the German athletes were practicing on? 
 

A: No.  I, I me a n the, the track and fiel
d was not bad but it wasn
™t in, in very good 
shape either and the, the male teacher th
ere if he could beat me  in high jumping 

 
 
18

18
which was really my specialty, he was so proud of hi ms elf and I mean as a ma n 
he should have been doing much better than 
I did.  But if he just beat me  by an 
inch he was very happy. 
 

Q: –the meet in Stuttgart. 

 

A: There must have been quite some  protes
t again in the, in the Unites Stat es.  I 
know that a Senator or Congressman Sella
r that he was pleading in the congress 
not to send a team over.  There were, ther
e were protest meets in Madison Square 
Garden, 20,000 people showed up.  There was 
a lot of resistance and this must 
have been the reason why they
 invited me  to come to St
uttgart and, and that as in 
19, 1936 to, to compete at a meet there a
nd it was really rough.  You know when 
you the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they 

didn™t wish me  well.  I knew that mu ch. 
 And the, the officials were hostile.  I 
think I me ntioned that before.  And it 
was very hard to, to compete against 
myself.  So but I was so ma d that I equaled the German record.  The German 

record then was five foot three and I equa
led that. I must have cleared it by, by 15 
inches at the time. I was so angry.  A
nd usually you have three tries for each 
height you know you start at 4, 6 let™s sa
y.  You have, if you do it the first time, 
fine.  But you have to go over it by thethird try otherwise you™re eliminated.  

Well all the other girls were out by if they
 did about 4, 8 and they were all out and 
I kept going and going on and going.  And 
every height I jumped over it on the 
first time .  So I did the 5, 
3 and I think the, the offici
als most likely would have 
liked to poison but they didn™t. And I was ju
st so elated.  I thought
 this is the first 
thing that ever happened to me , you know 
those lousy Nazis. 
 And after that I 
went home I  think and I wanted to share th
is with my fa mily and I think this was 
the last time  that I, I st ayed in Stuttgar t. 
 I, I went home  then and I said now this is 
4 weeks before the Olympics start.  I be
tter go home  and see what happens.  So I 

went home a nd my parents were happy and 
my br others were happy that I did this 
and I look for the ma il everyday, what™s going to happen, you know.  What, what 

excuses are they going to use, that as 
only one, one other German girl who, who 
was capable of doing this right and how ar
e they going to, if they don™t want me  
in there how are they going to
 get rid of me .  And I was 
really scared, aren™t they 
going to break my leg or what are they goi
ng to do to, to eliminate me .  But it was 
very simple.  One day a letter came and it sa
id in view of the 
fact that you have 
been doing very poorly lately we did not
 select you for the Olympic team.  Heil 
Hitler and that was the end of it.  And I 
said, I reme mber me 
sitting outside on the 
stoop and I got this letter and I must have
 used every profanity I knew and I knew 
a lot of them and at the same  ti me , I had su
ch an incredible feeling of relief.  It™s 
all over now, now I know what™s going to happe
n to me .  It was just like, like the 
biggest load was lifted off my shoulders 
and I know that was such a, a paradox.  
That I was angry, very very angry at 
the same  time so relieved.  And I don™t 
reme mber a thing about the Olympics. 
 

Q: Why were you so relieved? 

 

 
 
19

19
A: Well all this time I was worried how, fi rs
t of all am I going to compete, am I not 
going to compete, how are they going to el
iminate me or what am I going to do if 
I do compete and I do win a medal and I know the German way to, to 
acknowledge a victory you stand up on the,
 on the podium and Heil Hitler.  And I 
didn™t see that happening for me  too 
easily.  That would, I mean how can you 
expect a German girl to st and there a
nd, and raise her arm in the Hitler salute. 
 

Q: You mean a Jewish girl? 

 

A: A Jewish girl and this was on my mi nd 
for 2 years.  And all of a sudden I didn™t 
have to worry about it any more. A
nd there was a, a terrific relief. 
 

Q: Did you also think about 
the crowd reaction or the gove
rnme nt reaction to a win 
on your part? 
 

A: Had I won the Olympics or had I been allowed to compete in the Olympics I 
would have been a loser either way.  Caus
e had I won there would have been such 
a, an insult against the Ge rman psyche.  How can the, a Jew be good enough to 

win the Olympics.  Then I would have had to
 be afraid for my life, I™m sure.  And 
had I lost I would have been ma de as a 
joke.  See we knew that you couldn™t have, 
couldn™t do this and that, that 
was on my mi nd all these years. 
 

Q: So you got this letter. 

 

A; (chuckles)  excuse me. 

 
Q: –letter that said you™re not good en
ough–competed and tied German record.  
Didn™t make much sense. 
 
A: I think that was the fi rst time I really 
realized that my candidacy for an Olympic 
athlete was really all a sham, I wish, it 
was just something that the Germans did 
to, to fool the whole group.  Maybe that™s 
when I realized that I really don™t even 
know.  I have, I think I have complete amnesia what happened to me  after this.  I 

cannot reme mber whether I watched the 
Olympics.  I mean watch, you couldn™t 
watch there was not television but I list
ened to the Olympics.  I followed the 
Olympics in the newspaper.  I have no 
idea, I cannot, I have complete amnesia 
about it. 
 

Q: You don™t know where you were? 

 

A: I knew where I was.  Except I did not wa
nt to think about the Olympics.  As a 
ma tter of fac t  I, you know people all is fo
r the best and my parents looked at me  
feeling sorry for me  and my brothers looke
d at me  feeling sorry for me  and is she 
going to freak out or what™s 
going to happen to her.  I sa
id I™ll have to get away 
from here.  And I went to a spa under an assume d name  of course, you couldn™t 

you know afford to nobody would take me  if the y knew I was Jewish. And I sat 

 
 
20

20
there for two weeks.  Not talking to a
nybody.  I didn™t want to be bothered with 
anybody.  And I was just thinking about al
l this and what was going to happen 
and what did happen and that™s when I re
alized I have to get out of Ger many.  
That™s and I just made up my mi
nd I™m going to have to leave. 
 
Q: –being very aware of the Olympics. 

 

A: I have completely, I to this day I can™t reme mber what I did.  Whether I knew 
who did what or I notice this one person 
that I I knew that later on she came in 
third a girl I was very friendly with.  
She came in third in the high jumping, a 
German girl and but whether I realized
 it at the time  I do not know, I cannot 
r e me mb e r .  
 

Q: At what point do you think you came  to? 

 

A: I think that I only rea
lized what was really going on once I came  over to the 
States.  Friends of ours had saved all th
e newspaper articles where my name ™s up 
here do you know with all the ups and dow
ns and whether the Germans sa id and 
what the Americans said and what, what  was going on and all their promises and 

all the, their excuses.  The German excuse
s and I think that ™s the fi rst time I really 

realized how I was used as a political football. 
 

Q: Did the winners in your even
t, were the winners German?  
 

A: The high jump in the Olympics was won w
ith the height of 5 foot, 3, the height I 
had reached four weeks earlier and I had the 
best  chance to win a me dal.  I  could 
have had the gold me dal because (laughs) wh
en I got ma d, I did better, so I would 
have been mighty ma d seeing all those peopl
e out there with their uniforms on, all 
the swastikas flying, I would have been 
really ma d and I know I had a very good 
chance to win a me dal. 
 

Q: Was it hard for you to come  over to 
the United St ates, when did you come over 
here?  
 

A; Well when I came back from that spa, I told my parents I™m leaving.  I cannot 
stay here anymore.  This is no future fo
r me .  My brother had left already.  He 
came to the States in January I believe.  
No, no, no, no that wa s later.  I said I™m 
leaving and my father had a very good fr
iend who came from this town.  And who 
emigrated to the United States, became ve
ry rich here and when he visited our 

town, I was the big shot you know the Olym
pic candidate.  And he said to me  oh 
any time you want to come  to the United States, just let me  know and I™ll give you 

all the papers.  So we wrote him a letter
 and said that we were now ready to 
accept hi s offer and pretty quick a letter came  back saying well times are ve ry bad 

in the United States and you 
mi ght not be able to find a job and ma ybe things will 
get better in Germany 
and ma ybe you should rethi
nk your future.  Maybe you 
should stay and see what happe
ns. And my father wrote 
him a very strong letter 

 
 
21

21
back and he finally did give me  the pape
rs and I was able to come to the United 
States. 
 
Q: When was that? 

 

A: I came to the United States in May of 1937. 

 

Q: When you came over here, did you decide 
to pursue your athletic career or had 
you been completely soured? 
 

A: When I came over here um the first 
thing I had to do was ma ke some  mo ney 
because the Germans allowed each emigrant
 to take along 4 dollars and a came ra 

which everybody sold and lived on until they found a job and I had the same  

thing.  And the first thing I had to do is 
find a job.  But some how a letter, a, an 
article appeared in the long defunct Wo
rld Telegram newspa per, a New York 
newspaper about me  arriving.  I don™t know, 
I think my brother must have been 
ma naging to get this in there and talki
ng about what had happened to me and one 
day a coach showed up at my home  a nd said
 listen I have a track and field team 
and would you like to compete for me and 
I said you bet and that was it and he 
wasn™t a very good coach, it was an undertak
er.  And I kept teasing him t hat I 
thought the bodies that he prepared for wh
erever these bodies were going, were in 
better shape than the bodies he
 prepared to compete at the track meets.  But he 

tried hard and I competed here several events and did OK. 
 

Q: You weren™t turned off by sports– 

 
A: No, I, I really wanted to get back into
 it and I was right away
 very successful so 
that, that kept me  going I suppose.  The fi
rst year I was here I won the American 
championship in high jumping.  I won the American championship in shot put, 
weighing all of 112 pounds.  B
eating out my competition 
who weighed must have  
been twice my size and twice my we ight 
and that really gave
 me  a good feeling. 
 

Q: Did you feel some what vindicated– 

 

A: It felt ve ry good because I knew that some how word had to ge t back to Germany 
that I did win and that ma de me  feel 
very good but I knew it wouldn™t be in any 
newspapers.  Would be like word of mouth you know.  And I knew that people 

who wished me  well and there were so me
 Ger mans.  I mean not every German 
was a Nazi, they would be happy for me . 
 

Q: What about your fa mily, were th
ey able to get out of Ger many? 
 

A: We were very worried about my fa mi
ly.  My brother came here a few mo nths 
before I did.  And we we re very worried 
about my fa mily.  And finally my father 
was able to get out even though it wa s a mi r
acle.  They took all 
the, all the people 
who they wanted to the Germans who they 
wanted to keep in Germany, they just 

 
 
22

22
took their passports away so there wa s no 
way of for them to get out.  And my 
father had a work permit for England whic
h was pretty hard to get but he had 
done business with England quite a bit and 
he got that work permit and that was 
about to expire so he went to the author
ities and said listen can I have the, my 
passport back I need to have my work permit renewed and some body gave him 
this passport and my father said we are l
eaving so they packed
 a little suitcase, a 
little clean underwear and th
ey all took off, my brothe
r my mother and left  the 
house, left everything back and went to 
the next town, went to the next town, 
went to the next town.  Finally ended 
up in Cologne where they, they took  a 
plane and flew to England. 
 

Q: Were you able to communicate with them once you left Germa ny? 

 

A: Oh yes, we, we wrote to each other 
all the time but you had to be extremely 
careful what you wrote.  For instance ther
e was the Crystal nigh
t and they took all 
the me n from I think the age of 18 to 
ma ybe 60 and took them to concentration 
camps and we had no idea was my father ta
ken or was, wasn™t he and my mother 
wrote a letter  that  that  Dad was quite ill and had to go away so we knew he was 

gone.  And we tried everything you know c
ongressmen and tried to get him back 

and he finally did come  back afte
r 4 weeks weighing 80 pounds.  And signing 
himself into the hospital in, in Lauphei
m and the next day the nuns who ran the 
hospital came to him and said you have to 
leave.  The author
ities told me  we 
don™t, we can™t keep Jews here.  So they threw him out weighing 80 pounds and 

he had to recuperate another way.  And I still blame the m apa r t from his smoking 

cigarettes that he died at a ve
ry sudden death of a heart attack. 
 
Q: Where was he sent? 
 

A: Dachau.  That™s near Munich.  And they
 took all their, their clothing away, they 
dressed them in these clothes, you know
 like you see in ol
d movies with the 
stripes, the cotton, the cotton 
suits and they had to stand outside from 5:00 in the 
morning un, it was November until 11:00 at ni ght.  No, no warm underwear, no 

warm, nothing and I me an this is what they, what they did. 
 

Q: This is in 38, 39? 

 

A: I think it was in 39.  I know the Crystal 
night.  I can™t reme mb er was it I think it 
was 38 yeah. 
 

Q: –your father had to go away, 
what was going through your mind? 
 

A: Well we just, we just tried to ge
t him out of there you know, we wrote to 
everybody that we could think of to try to 
get him out and whether, it was, that we 
were successful or whether they were just
 saying well let™s ge t those old guys out 
of here.  You know after 4 weeks or 5 
weeks he came home.  And my husband™s 
brother and future brother Œ in Œ law, th
ey were also in Dachau and the Germans 

 
 
23

23
told them if you can go some place, leave Ge
rmany today, you can leave.  So they 
China was the only place that would take
 you without any red tape so they bought 
steamship tickets to, to China and they went to China. 
 

Q: –did they give him a reason why they were taking him?  

 

A: No, that was just a you know it was a 
fun thing to do I s
uppose for the Nazis. 
 

(Change tape) 

 

(Tape 4 of 4) 

 

Q: What kind of team did Germany present in the high jump– 

 

A: In the hi gh jump, usually there are al wa
ys three competitors for each event, three 
in the dash, and three in th
e shot put and three in the 
long jump and they only had 
two girls in the high jump.  And that 
was a little bit unusua
l and a long, a long 
time later I found out that the team was to
ld that Bergma n is injured and cannot 
compete. But I also had the suspicion th
at they were trying to ma neuver this 
whole thing because a letter was sent  
around that those who were in Olympic 
candidates should not expect to be chosen 
in some of them and that they did not 
measure up and that only in some events there would only be 2 competitors and I 

think that was really done for my sake al
ready.  Because they were already trying 

to get rid of me somehow, maybe, I™m not
 sure but it, it seemed to be very 
unusual that there would only be
 two girls in the high jump. 
 
Q: When did you get this letter? 
 

A: I think they came, the letter came in th
e, in the winter before the Olympics, I™ll 
have to check the date. 
 

Q: What role if any do you think the 1936 
played in bolstering 
the Nazis for what 
was to come ? 
 

A; Adolph Hitler tried to us
e these Olympics as his propaganda vehicle to show the 
world how powerful he was, to show th
e world how unified a Germany was and I 
think he tried to scare the world into 
not standing up against him some how.  I 
think that™s, that™s the way 
I, I have to look at it.  
The Olympi cs were a great, a 
great success for Germany at the time.  A
nd they built this beautiful st adium.  I 

mean people found work due, due to the 
Olympics, or help the Nazis to, to 
succeed. 
 

Q: So you think he did gain from 

 

A: I he definitely did gain from it and 
I, I™ve seen it writt
en in a book someplace 
about how the Olympics are supposed to br
ing the youth of the 
world together and 

 
 
24

24
that some body ma de the rema rk that
 in 1936, the youth of the world came 
together in these Olympics and four y
ears later they were, they were coming 
together against each other in a battlefield.  You know then the war started in 
1940. 
 

Q: –did you lose friends or fa mily me mbers? 

 

A: Unfortunately my husband™s parents and 
ma ny of his relatives were not able to 
get out and we really tried so hard and we
 had to battle people here to help and 

there was so little help to 
be had.  My husband has very rich relatives, they had a 

jewelry store in, in New York and they™re
 ve ry rich and I appr oached them for 

papers for him and they refused and I ma de
 out his papers for him. I mean I got 
him out like it was really not quite honest
 to get him here.  But they, we didn™t 
even think about approaching them fo
r his parents because we  knew they 
wouldn™t do it.  And we tried, we tried to
 get them into Cuba and you know the, 
the people would buy visas for Cuba for $400 and we got 2 visas for them and 

just when their turn was about to co
me , these visas were found out to be phony 
and that avenue was shut off so and they 
were all so a little bit reluctant.  My 
father -in -law never could understand that 
this could happen to him.  He said I™ve 
been living in this town forever, we we
re friends with everybody.  They can™t do 
anything to us or nothing is
 going to happen to us.  And then when he did realized 
that he should have done some thing, it wa
s too late.  There were ma ny, I, I don™t 
reme mber how ma ny relatives, I think it at
 least 15 or 30, I don™t reme mbe r  how 

many and in my fa mily 
too. Some  and friends. 
 

Q: –gettingout? 
 
A: Right, it was, it was.  The American peopl
e a lot of them did not kill themselves, 
you know.  They ma de all the big speeches how, how helpful they wanted to be, 

like my sponsor when it came down to it, he wasn™t too anxious so my br other 

who there, the father of the motion pict
ure industry by the name  of Carl Laemlle, 
I mean he™s a very famo us ma n, he c a me  into the United States from Laupheim.  

And he ma de out 300 affidavits.  Anybody 
who approached him for papers, he 
ma de the m out.  And he wasn™t sure wh
ether these people were
n™t going to sit on 
his pocket eventually you know but he wa
s wonderful but I think the American 
people in general were not very
 generous in that respect. 
 

Q: –think about 1936, what impact 
on your life, thes
e experiences? 
 

A: I think it made me a lot tougher, you know
 to face what, what I had to face and 
life here was very, very hard in the be
ginning, I worked as a housemaid for $10 a 
week and even though life was a lot ch
eaper then, you couldn™t get very far on 
$10 a week.  And my husband worked as
 a house painter, be
ing a physician he 
worked as a house painter when he, when he
 arrived over here.  It ma de us, I think 
tougher you know but what we went through 
and it mi ght have helped us even 
though it was pretty toug
h school to go through. 

 
 
25

25
 
Q: Anything else you want to add? 

 

A: Well one thing I, I should me ntion maybe
.  I recently got a letter from the 
National, German National Olympic committee and they invited me  to be their 

guest of honor at the Atlanta Ol
ympic game s from July the 19
th
 until August the 
3
rd
.  And although I have never gone back to Germany and they invited me before 
for some  other occasion, I have accepted th
e invitation and I think it will be a very 
emotional thing for me but I, I think 
I said to my husband what goes around 
comes around and I think I™ve got to make my
 peace with this thing at least even 
though it, it™s it gnawed on me  all thes
e years you know and every time  the 
Olympics come  around, I I get ma d as hell again, I say why, why did this happen 

to me .  And but I™ve got to ma ke peace before I go wherever I™m going to go, up 

or down, I don™t know.  So I™m looking forwar
d to that and I think it was a very 
gesture.  They have tried to and the town
 where I come  from also they have tried 

very hard to ma ke a mends.  They take 
care of the Jewish cemetery.  Not a si ngle 
Jew went back to that town.  But the, th
e citizens of the town take care of the 
cemetery and they have Jewish artists come
.  The y have ,they have all kinds of 
activities to not to let the Jewish life that
 once was there di e.  
And I think that is 
that helped me  too because even though I would have, I never, never thought of 

going back.  I was invited 3 times from the town to go and some  people went and 

they had a ve ry good time.  I said no, I 
will never set foot on German soil again.  
And I won™t.  I don™t know how long I™ll la
st but I™ll never go back.  But I did 
accept that invitation and I™m
 looking forward to it. 
 

Q: One last question–boycott or whatever that
 it would have made any difference in 
terms of what followed the Olympics? 
 

A: Any boycott that would have happened 
would have influenced only the Ol ympic 
game s that it would not have been the 
huge success that Hitler expected from it 
but Hitler and Nazis they
 would have gone on no ma tter what, even if only one 
other country would have shown up to, to
 participate in th
e Olympics. I don™t 
think it had anything to do with what he
 wanted to accomplish.  He wanted to 
conquer the world and he, he, he would ha
ve gone forward no ma tter what.  And I 
don™t think that the Olympics in that
 respect had anything to do with it. 
 

Q: –feelings about Jewish 
athletes in other countri
es who did participate– 
 

A: Well there are two trends of thoughts.  They could have stayed home or they 
could have come  and showed what a Jew c
ould do.  As a ma tter of fact, I think 

high jump was won by a Czech, a Jewish girl
 and I think that  was like spitting in 

Hitler™s eye, see a Jews, they can do it. 
And I think there were  some  that didn™t 
come  and that was their, whatever they wa
nted to decide about their lives.  But I 

think they only hurt themselves and they, 
it didn™t ma ke any, it didn™t ma ke an 
impact.  You know I think it had more, more impact for the Jews to go there and, 

and beat the Germans than, than to stay 
home and say I™m not going.  I have that 

 
 
26

26
much respect for myself that
 I won™t go.  I don™t think that
 that, was, the ones that 
did it I respect them for it but the ones 
who didn™t they have my respect too 
because they did what I woul
d have done, beat the Nazis. 
 
(End)
