                                       Interview with Doriane Kurz 
 May 13, 1997 
 
Answer: Well, I'm Dorian Kurz and I came 
to this country in 1946, after the war, 

with my  brother, we were orphaned during 
the war and we were 
brought over here to 
America by family that was liv
ing here and the first part of my  history was recorded 
by the Holocaust Museum a few years ago. 

Question: And your brother's name? 

A: My brother's name is Alfred Kurz a
nd we call him Freddy and I will probably be 

calling him that in the course of this in
terview.  And he lives in New Jersey. 
Q: So later on we're very interested in 
your relationship with 
your brother and in 
general your relationship with 
your brother seems to have been the factor that still 
exists in your life, that brought you through that
 experience, so if we start at, arriving 
in Amsterdam after the war, just in gene
ral, the climate of Amsterdam and the 
environment there, in your comm
unity, how could you describe it? 
A: Let's see, I can't answer that specifica
lly.  I'm going to drop 
back from that a little 

bit.  At the end of the war, we were liberat
ed from a train that took us out of Bergen-
Belsen and the aim of the Nazi
s was to destroy the train, but we were liberated before 

that could happen, by the Russi
ans.  And that happened in a town which later on was 
in East Germany.  It was in the spring, 
in April and eventually, it took three months 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001

for the Red Cross to bring us back to Amst
erdam, along with the other survivors.  My 
mother was still alive and in 
the course of our train ride
, she got typhus, which I had 
had before that.  And she was not well, ev
en before the typhus.  She survived the 
crisis of the typhus in that little town 
in East Germany and 
when she was up and 
about again, the Red Cross made c
ontact with us a
nd brought us through 
Lypeseig(ph), which city still 
exists, back eventu
ally into Holland.  Now, a couple of 
recollections of that time stick out very shar
ply.  In Lypeseig(ph) my , there was a, we 
stayed in an armo ry of some sort, or a 
compound that had an ar
mo ry and outside of 
that armory, there was a mach
ine, like a clothes wringer 
in appearance, except there 
were knives in the middle.  You turned 
some wheel, some lever and there were 
knives inside.  And Freddy, my  brother, w
ho always had had inve
stigative leanings, 
stuck his finger in there and turned the, tu
rned the lever and cut off the tops of his 
fingers.  I remember that because it was a lot of blood and a lot of hoopla and my 

mo ther very upset and very aggravated 
and they got him ba
ndaged up and he has 
little bumps on three of his fingers, to the, at
 the top of his finger cause he cut off the 

top of his fingers, so certa
inly do rememb er that.  I rememb er waiting along the way 
somewhere, in , with lots of other people,
 waiting for truck trans
port to move us from 
one place to another.  I had 
found in that little town where we were liberated, a doll 
somebody had left behind.  And for that doll, 
which was really my  first toy in a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 3 
 
 
long time and I was nine, I made little clothi
ng out of little pieces 
of material and I 
made a little cradle out of shoe
 box type of things and I was 
very attached to that little 
doll.  I put it down somewhere in the midst 
of that great mass of people waiting to be 
transported and somebody took it and I cried 
and cried.  It was a great blow. 
Eventually we got back into Amsterdam, 
into a large barracks,
 I don't know where it 
was, but you know, it's a child's recollection 
and I remember being in that large place 
like, sort of like the barracks we'd  had 
in the camps, but large and lying down and 
taking a nap and when I woke up, at the f
oot of my  bunk, was my
 oldest girlfriend, 
Nomi(ph) Moskovitz(ph), with whom I gr
own up and whom I had not seen during 
the intervening years.  And 
she also, with her family, wa s in that displaces persons 
facility and my mother had found her.  So, a 
couple of those things that really stand 
up very sharply.  Eventually we were 
out of those barracks and into our old 
apartment.   

Q: I just wanted to ask before we went... 

A: I can tell you what, what happened with No
mi(ph), I mean that's fine.  I didn't, I 
saw Nomi(ph) for a few times in the followi
ng year.  She and her family also moved 
back to Amsterdam.  She had two brothers, 
one brother and at the time before the war 
and after the war she had some mo re sib
lings, her parents had some mo re children 
and it was quite remarkable b
ecause her father was sent to a separate place, separate 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 4 
 
 
concentration camp from Nomi(ph) and her 
mother and miraculously that family 
survived and was reunited after the war.  
I will come back, I will tell you more about 
Nomi(ph) in a while.  She re
mained in Amsterdam, even
tually she was married and 
she moved to Israel and the last time I sa
w Nomi(ph) was in March of 1946 and then 
did not see her again until 1959, 
which was my first trip to Israel and I had that trip, 
on that trip I started out going to Europe
 first and went thr
ough Holland and saw her 
parents and they gave me her address in Is
rael and I am a blonde
 and blue eyed and 
Nomi(ph) has a dark comp lexion, very dark
 eyes and black hair and we have, we 
were friends from the time we were in nurse
ry school, four and I always felt, I guess 
because it was in Holland and I was blonde a
nd blue eyed, that 
I was ordinary and 
looked like everyone else and that she was 
beautiful because she was so different 
looking, so dark and she had long black hair and I was envious of her.  In 1959 when 
I had not seen her for 13 years and in that
 time we had both gone 
from being girls to 
being women.  She had been married, I was not
 and I visited her in 
Israel, there, I got 
such a shock because there wa
s this big, fat woman, very large and it was Nomi(ph) 
and we were unable to comm
unicate on any level, almost entirely, there was some 
inanities just that went, were
 between us and totally, you know, but we had been sort 
of like sisters, we slept in each othe
rs house _____, it was exactly like two people 
from other planets and I have not been in touc
h with her since, so 
that's about it.  I

will, I will go back now to my time in, in
 Amsterdam.  So eventually, and I don't 
know how my mother accomplished that, we got
 back our apartment.
  At the time we 
were arrested in the middle of the night 
and we moved, the apartment was taken from 
us and our furniture was done away with 
and I suppose there mu st have been some 
resettlement commission and my mother got 
back our apartment and we went back 
into it, but she, my mother 
was really quite sick at that
 time already and we lived in 
that apartment a very short time a
nd my mother was hospitalized and... 
Q: None of the furniture was there, none of the same? 

A: None of the furniture was there, no, not 
at all.  The furniture
 my  parents had had 
was made in Vienna, custom made to or
der for my  parents by a well known architect 
and none of that was there.  But, my , there 
was some simp le furnitu
re that my  mo ther 
had.  We were not there very
 long before it was impossible for my  mo ther to continue 
as she was and she was moved to the hosp
ital, the apartment was still ours and she 
underwent some surgery and Freddy and I went 
to live with friends of my  parents, I 
will allude briefly, I mentioned those peopl
e when I made the vi
sual tape because 
those were the people who were
 in our apartment the night the Gestapo came.  Those 
were, that was the family th
at my mother was hiding and they had resettled after the 
war, they were all hidden, the memb ers of 
that family whose name was Roos, R-o-o-
s.  They had been in, separately under ha
doken(ph) and they were reassemb led after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 6 
 
 
the war and they were living in a little town
 called Rainin(ph) in Holland, about an 
hour and a half outside of 
Amsterdam and they lived in
 a house on a dike, it was a 
small farming town and Fre
ddy and I went to live with them while my  mo ther was 
not well.  Eventually my  mo ther was br
ought back to the apartment and she did 
linger until March of 1946, when 
she died.  So for those nine months that she was ill, 
we were most of time living with the fam
ily Roos in Rainin(ph) on the dike and I 
therefore am not really, I, there's not a w
hole lot I can say about Amsterdam and what 
happened to it.  The only times we were br
ought in was to visit my  mo ther and that 
not very often, once every couple of months, she... 

Q: She was far away? 

A: She was in Amsterdam and... [ringing phone] 

Q: So, we'v e been interrupted, but we
 have been discussing how you and your 
brother coped together with the loss of your mo ther. 

A: That, that answer is 
really on so many different levels.  I would tell you from 
today's point of view, looking b
ack as an adult person, that I'm not, I think I'm pretty 
mentally stable, fairly so, I mean no worse 
than mo st people, but I attribute that in 

very large part to the, to two facts.  The 
mo st important is that I have a brother.  I 
think I would not really have managed wit
hout, because he was my root.  In general 
I, I think today that children 
can survive almo st anything as
 long as they are confident 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 7 
 
 
in the care and love of a 
parent.  And although, I mean
 obviously my  history, my  
childhood was not a very good ch
ildhood, looked at it from that point of view.  Still, 
if I comp are my self to the children I read 
about in the paper who suffer abuse at the 
hands of their parents, I had a rosy ch
ildhood in comparison.  Because even looking 
back from here, surely there we
re mo ments of fear and lots of horrible things that I, I 
looked at, but I never doubted my  survival 
and I always felt secure when my  mo mmy  
was there and I was fortunate in that, that
 mother was not an hysterical sort.  She 

made it, it seem okay and I came through 
the war never doubting that we'd  come 

through, in fact I rememb er lots of talk
 about, you know, with my  mo ther about after 
the war, when my  father, whom we calle
d Poppy, would be back and we never 

doubted that.  And after the war, directly 
after the war, while my mother was still 
alive, we talked a great deal about when
 she would get better and in that year it 
certainly began to dawn on me that 
she was not getting better, but it was in 
conceivable because that was grounded in my
 security.  Now we were very lucky 
because we knew, Freddy and I, from a very early age on, that we 
had lots of family 
elsewhere, in America and my mother dr
illed us consistently in addresses, in 
Palestine, where her brother lived and in Am
erica, where my father's family was and 
so I guess she figured if she wasn't going to make it through, she wanted us to have a 

place that we would go to.  It was a very cl
ose family and directly after the war, of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 8 
 
 
course contact was made with them again a
nd in fact, one of my  father's brothers 
came to Amsterdam not long after the war and 
he got, he got a passport, he got a visa 
and he was able to come and to arrange fo
r my mother's care and also to start to 
arrange for our coming to America and so by 
the time I was told that my mother had 
not long to live and by the time I, we intern
alized that, we knew that we were not 
going to be in an orphanage, for example,
 we knew that we we
re going to America 
and so we were looking forwar
d to that.  So the fact th
at we survived emotionally, 
fairly, fairly emotionally stable, both of us, certainly is due to th
e type of person my  
mother was, the fact that we had a lovi
ng relationship and the 
fact that we were 
confident in that close family that we
 had overseas.  Now, 
for me, I think the 
importance of my  brother really happens af
ter that, it's after we come here.  Once, 
once my  mo ther died and my  own roots we
re gone, in that sense, you know my , my  
parents were gone and, and Holland was 
gone, even though I was 
here with loving 
aunt and uncle, still, it and, and a loving a
unt and uncle who had 
been very close to 
my  parents so, my  parents were talked about, it wasn't like, you know, I was with 
strange people who had no idea 
about my background, but still it was the fact that I 
had a brother that gave me 
a feeling of belonging.  With
 my  own history, belonging 
to something that had started when I st
arted, when I was born.  And that has 
increased in importance, or that did increase 
in importance to me, in
 the years that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 9 
 
 
were growing up in America. 
 I say that despite the fact that we entered a wonderful 
home and you know, that we were cared for 
and loved, but, butchildren don't give up 
what's theirs easily and my  background was 
mine.  And my  brother was the only one 
who had really shared it and who, you know, 
we'd  had the same experiences, we had 
seen the same things, the bad 
stuff and we were very close.  Now, besides that, I was 
the older of the two of us by 16 months
 and my  mo ther w
ould always, you know, 
blame me when we had fights, cause I 
was the older one, I 
should know better and 
she had always made me be responsible 
when, when we were, for some reason, you 
know, it was up to me, so when
 she died, I felt definitely a responsibility for him and 
for us as a brother-sister team and for valu
es such as religious 
observance, that we 
had learned there, I mean 
I jealously guarded those pa
rts of our background that I 
thought were important for us and that woul
d have been important for my  parents. 
And I spun them into a little private thing 
between us.  And because we were very 
close in age, we really were close personally
 as well, we related well.  To this day 
there's certainly no one in the world with w
hom I fight as mu ch as I do with him. 
We, we can barely be in each other's co
mpany for 10 minutes without one of us 
screaming at the other.  We certainly don't 
have the same points of view and we see 
life differently and he's a man, I'm a woman,
 so that already is different and, but 
underlying it, there is a very deep love a
nd respect that goes bot
h ways.  For my  60th 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 10 
 
 
birthday my  brother gave me a 
surprise party in a restaurant
 here in New York and he 
made a speech, I, he never, he never says 
anything nice, he never gives a compliment 
to anyone's face, he'll never say you look nice,
 or that's great, what you did, never. 
But that man got up there a
nd made a speech about me wh
ich was unbelievable.  He's 
a kind, he's a mo re closed person than I am
 and that was one of the few times in his 
life ever, that the window was opened.  And 
I didn't, I never needed those words, you 
know, to kind of let me know that it is a tw
o way street because he's done much more 
me in my life.  We'v e tried to do for each 
other.  But he's always been there for me 
and I know and I've said it many times, that if
 God forbid I had lost him, I, I wouldn't 
have made it, I am sure of that. 

Q: Thinking of you and your
 brother and going back to the time between your 
mo ther died, when you actually got on the boa
t and then the trip over to America, 
you mentioned your being ve
hement about your little secrets and religious 
observances, was your faith, were you able to
 practice it together with the community 
during that time, or was it important at all? 

A: I'm sorry, I don't know which time you mean now? 

Q: The time from, between your
 mother's passing and your getting to America, that 
transition of time before you were with your family. 

A: See again, this is not an easy answer. 
 My mo ther was a very observant women in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 11 
 
 
terms of the practice of Judaism, but sh
e was never dogmatic.  And she was very 
clever about the way she, she tried to 
instill that into Freddy and me.  I never 
rememb er her saying you cannot do this on, 
on, on Shabbas(ph) or
 you can't eat this 
and that together, I never rememb er her sa
ying that, but I read 
from a very early age 
and one day, for example, I found, I 
loved books, and I found 
a book lying around, I 
looked at it and there were pictures in it a
nd, and I tried to read it but some of the 
words were too big and I aske
d about it and she said, "Oh, 
well, if you want me to, I'll 
read you story."  And you know, that was 
a book of bible stories.  Well she did 
everything in that way, she tr
ied to make things likable and fun, so whatever practice 
we did, it was never onerous 
in any way, it was always in a good context, so I can't 
even tell you that I knew about the laws of 
Kashrut or the laws 
of, of Saturday as 
such, I don't know that I could have verba
lized them, but I knew what we did and 
didn't do with my  mo ther and tried to conti
nue to do that.  Well, we grew up in, after 
the war, first in the house of those people 
in, in Rainin(ph) a
nd they were also 
observant to a degree, but I 
know there was no kosher food to
 be had, or kosher meat 
to be had in Holland at that 
time, especially where we were
.  I cannot imagine that the 
food that we ate after the war was, was 
kosher, but I don't reme
mb er being in agony 
or anything of the sort.  So
 I know there was no meat served at the table with butter 
or milk, for example, but I don't rememb er
 ever questioning like where did, there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 12 
 
 
wasn't that mu ch meat, but I don't rememb
er questioning where the meat came from, 
we were just happy to have 
any sort of food.  And so the people with whom we 
stayed certainly were not against observing 
because they had come from an observant 
background as well.  And when I came to Am
erica, my  aunt and 
uncle, my  uncle was 
my father's brother and my aunt, the la
dy who we grew up with, Lillian, she came 
from a very observant house, probably mo re 
so than the house that my  parents had 
grown up in and so there was no problem about
 observance.  In the interim, between 
the time we left Holland and the time we came 
to America, well, okay, I'll talk about 
that for a little bit.  I alrea
dy mentioned that one of my fa
ther's brothers came over to 
Holland, and that was my Uncle Charlie and 
my  father's, my  father and his brother 
had world wide optical business before th
e war and we had an office in Amsterdam 
and so he came over both to take, look after 
my  mo ther and Freddy and me and also I 
think, to see what was left 
from a business point of view.  And he spent many, several 
months actually, in Holland.  He was there 
when my mother died
.  And he came to 
visit us, also stay with us in Rainin(ph), in
 that little town where we were, just a quick 
little aside there, I mean, th
is little town in Holland was not up to the minute in 
technology and the house we had really, litera
lly was on a dike.  A dike, a dike is 
really a road, it's like the 
river ran below and then on the, as you know Holland is 
very flat, so from the river to the land next 
to the river is just a flat continuation and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 13 
 
 
then a dike was built up high, like a wall and 
at the top of the wall they paved it and 
that was a road.  And then on the other side
 of the road there were houses, so that's 
where we lived.  And, but there was no cen
tral heating for example and there was a 
big pot-bellied stove in the living room, one 
of those black things
 and we fed it coal 
and wood and it heated up the living room, 
but the bedrooms, wh
ich were up on the 
second floor, didn't have any h
eat and anyone who's ever been
 in the low countries or 
in Germany in the wintertime, you know that th
ings are very cold there, but this is 
what we were used to and it certainly di
dn't bother us, but when my  Uncle Charlie 
came to stay with us, see, th
at was in the middle of the winter and he, there was, it 
was a little house and the family Roos ha
d two boys and there 
was Freddy and me 
and so there were only a certain number 
of bedrooms and so my  Uncle Charlie 
shared our bed, in a big large bed and 
I rememb er trying to sleep all night and 
couldn't because my poor Uncle Charlie was 
just trying to hold 
onto us for warmth, 
he was literally all night, you could hear 
his teeth rattling and 
he was physically 
shaking.  And so, anyway, but he was ther
e when my mother died and then it was 
very hard to get, get visa
s to move people, including ch ildren from western Europe to 
America, because everybody was trying to co
me to America.  And my uncle with 

whom I was going to live when I came to 
America, my Uncle Benjamin, who was 
another brother of my  father, in order to ge
t Freddy and me to have
 a visa to come to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 14 
 
 
America, went to Washington to see Presid
ent Truman and he got for us a special 
permit, read into the Congress of the United 
States, to give us priority to come in, 

which is how we managed to
 get in by the following Augus
t, August of '46 and while 
my Uncle Benjamin was trying for that a
nd my Uncle Charlie was in Europe, it was 
arranged that after my  mo ther died, that 
Freddy and I, in order 
to get a visa, should 
be, should go to Sweden to es
tablish residency there and 
from there, once we had our 
visa, to come to the United St
ates and eventually that is what happened.  We left, we 
left... 

Q: Why Sweden? 

A: I think the American consulate was ope
n in Sweden, but the American consulate 
was not yet open in Amsterdam and maybe 
because Sweden was a neutral country, I, 

I, I don't know the politics of the thing, but 
apparently something like that.  It was 
possible to get the visa from Sweden and we
 got a priority becau
se we were orphaned 
and because my Uncle Benjamin never t
ook no for an answer 
on anything and just 
went straight to the head man.  He got to
 the outer office of Pr
esident Truman and got 
to his aide and arranged for th
at.  So my  mo ther died in March and March of '46 and 

Freddy and I were brought to 
Amsterdam for the funeral and after the funeral they 
took me to see Nomi(ph), to say good-bye to
 her because we knew we were going to 
go to America and then shortly thereafter we
 flew to Sweden and we were taken to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 15 
 
 
Sweden by our Uncle Roos, the man whom 
we had been living with, he was not 
really an uncle, he was just friends, but
 we called him, his name was Abraham, 
Ab(ph) Roos, so he flew with us to, to 
Sweden, where my Uncle Charlie was and so 
we hooked up with my  Uncle Charlie there.
  That plane trip
, going to Sweden, I 
remember very vividly because I... 
Q: Your first? 

A: It was my first plane trip
, but I was, I had a terrible case of car sickness as a child, 
I, I couldn't even get into a car without th
rowing up.  And this was a fairly small 
plane, not a very nice day and, and, and it 
put me off flying for 
decades.  That was a 
three hour trip.   All I remember is that
 that plane kept goi
ng up and falling down, 
going up and falling down.  Must have h
it, you know, it was a prop plane, it flew 
under the clouds, it hit all those air pockets
 and went down and 
even though we had 
not seen an orange in our recollection, 
Freddy and I, they gave
 out oranges on that 
plane, I filled up every little bag, just threw 
up that entire trip.  
Sat next to the man 
who was taking us, you know, Mr. Roos and Fr
eddy was sitting in a jump seat and at 

some point they found Freddy 
trying to open up the door next to him, I rememb er 
that and they rushed, they
 rushed him away from that
 little, it was like a parachute 
seat they had him sitting in and he was 
fooling around with the door.  We got to 
Stockholm at the end of the day, stay
ed in a hotel which we called the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 16 
 
 
conteenantalb(ph), this is Ho
tel Continental, across from th
e railroad station, we got 
there late at night and my Uncle Charlie
 was there and we, we, we both remember 
this first meal that we had there because
 Holland was still pretty bare after the war, 
you certainly couldn't get a whole lot of e
xotic food products and for us exotic was 
pretty well everything, like oranges, you know, 
were very exotic.  And so eggs were 
hard to come by and so on, 
so we got in there pretty late at night, I guess about 10 
o'clock we, we were taken into the dining 
room to have a meal because we hadn't 
eaten very mu ch and so Freddy immediatel
y ordered to eggs and so we ate supper 
and then went to bed, where Freddy threw 
up all night.  I mean, they'd  said it was 
because he ate too much rich food after not
 having had rich food 
for a long time, but I 
don't know.  Anyway he was sick all night. 
 Two men, my  Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph) 
Roos, trying to comfort a little boy who was 
throwing up all night and I'm sure they 
were wishing that there was some woman 
with them who knew what to do better.  I 
stayed in Stockholm for awhile.  We lived w
ith a family who's last name escapes me 
for a couple of weeks and then my  uncle, my
, Ab(ph) Roos went back to Holland and 
my  Uncle Charlie arranged fo
r Freddy and me to be moved to a boarding school for 

the summer because he had to go back to
 America, my Uncle Charlie and somebody 
had to look after us, so they put us into 
some boarding school in the country, in the 
woods outside of Stockholm and we spent 
the summer there.  
The caretaker, of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001

course all the boys were gone from that boa
rding school, the caretaking family was 
paid to look after us and by some stroke of
 fortune, they spoke German and of course 
my , I had, I mean my  parents spoke German
, that was there native language so that 
was my  first language and Dutch was my
 second language.  And so they had a 
daughter my  age, so that 
summer was spent, her name was Marisha(ph), Mousey and 
so that summer was spent in, 
in the company of that little 
girl.  Oh, lots of things 
about that summer, first of all my Uncle Charlie... 
Q: Let's go to the other side while we go, can you... 

A: Sure. 

Q: Can you hold that thought a mo ment? 
 Okay, we're moving to side two. 
[end of side one, tape 1] 

A: I was speaking about the things in St
ockholm.  Most noteworthy was, still while 
both men were with us, my  Uncle Charlie
 and Ab(ph) Roos, they, we all went 
walking, I, I just rememb er rivers and bri
dges in the city of 
Stockholm and 
sunshine 
and most of all what I remember, I, wh
at I, I guess I consider today to be 

supermarket, there was stores that just 
had racks and racks of food, fruit and food, 
which just boggled our minds.  And I mu st sa
y that even today when I think about it, 
I'm amazed at that, that in, in Europe afte
r the war, there were countries that were 
bare of all those things and 
countries that just, just had 
it up the kazoo.  I mean, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 18 
 
 
just hadn't seen fruit for, all over, the stor
es, by, by the late spring and summer of 
1946 in Sweden, perhaps they'd  always had it,
 I don't know, but they were just full of 
it and we, we couldn't imagine that.  It 
was an upbeat time for us, even though we 
spoke a lot about my  mo ther and the fact that
 she'd died and that 
made us sad, but we 
were, Freddy and I, looking forward a lot to Am
erica.  And so then they moved us to 
that boarding school.  Somewhere in the course
 of that summer I got my  first taste of 
bubble gum, tried to learn how to blow bubbles. 
 It mu st have been a pretty austere 
boarding school because the shoc
k was the first morning when we got up, we went to 
breakfast and they served us, what seemed 
to me to be sour 
milk and what I now 
know to be rye crisps and I couldn't eat it. By the end of the su
mmer I liked it quite a 
lot, but it's, I, I've, I've talked to people 
since and that was a fairly standard Swedish 
breakfast, which is yogurt and rye crisp but I 
considered it sour milk and crackers, I 
thought it was awful. 

Q: Your friend, who you were
 mentioning, who you spent the whole summer with, is 
this beyond the boarding, befo
re the boarding school, or? 
A: That was in the boarding school, her fam
ily were caretakers there.  Maybe while 

all the teachers and the children were gone, th
ey were caretakers and we spent a lot of 
time playing make believe.  My Uncle Ch
arlie had taken us 
on a shopping binge and 
I had noticed in a store, nightgowns, 
long nightgowns and you know I was 10 years 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 19 
 
 
old and they were long nightgowns with pr
etty little puffy sleeves and I made him 
buy me a pink and a blue a
nd they became princess gowns, I wore one and Mousey 
wore the other and we made
 Freddy be the prince.  Spent a lot of time running 
through the woods, make believe like that.  
Anyway, in the cour
se of that summer, 
our visa came through and the, Mousey's 
mo ther, the lady who spoke German and 
with whom we were able to communicat
e to, brought us to Gurtaberg(ph), from 
where the ship we were to sail on, saile
d.  And the ship was the Grippsholm(ph), 
Grippsholm(ph) and so Freddy a
nd I set sail.  It was a two 
week trip from Sweden to 
America, I don't know why is s
hould have taken that long.  
We were put into separate 
state rooms, I shared mine with thr
ee women, two upper bunks, two lower bunks and 
Freddy shared his with three men on a diffe
rent deck.  And that made me very 
anxious.  The lady who took us to the ship
 had arranged for a si
ngle maiden lady to 
eat her meals with us.  Somewhere around 
the third day out there was a drill, you 
know, in case something happened to the sh
ip, but everybody forgot to tell me it was 
a drill and so in the middle of 
the sirens and the whistles blowing, we were told to get 
on deck and, and we were assigned to life
boats and to my  horror, we were assigned 
to different lifeboats.  And I wouldn't let go 
of him, I was just screaming and crying. 
Nobody told me that the ship wasn't going 
down.  It was only afterwards that I 
learned that.  I, I... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 20 
 
 
Q: Did they end up letting you be
 together?  Stay together? 
A: I don't rememb er.  Somewhere I found out 
it wasn't for real, I guess.  But I just 
rememb er screaming and crying a lot.  I 
contracted a skin condition which I, _____, 
we knew if was called impetigo, it's very 
painful and extremely contagious and the 
fear was that I would not 
be allowed into America, 
because they, they weren't 
allowing anything contagious 
in.  Penicillin had come on the scene not long before 
and the ship's doctor decided to give me 
a regimen of penicillin every three hours, 
mo rning and night, so four tim
es a day and four times at night, they would come to 
my  bunk in the ship and give me shot in my  r
ear end.  It didn't  help.  By the time we 
came to America, I was still full of impetigo 
and eventually, unfortunately gave it to 
the whole family in America, 
including the two year old child, but in order to hide the 
condition, I was put into glove
s.  I mean the lady who was eating meals with us and 
who looked after to make sure that we didn'
t fall off the ship I guess, took care to put 
me into a pair of gloves and when we arri
ved in America, I guess that we, this was 
now August fifth, 1946.  We
 were still among the first 
wave of orphaned children 
that were allowed in after the war and 
I guess the, the newspapers got lists of 
celebrities that were expected on these vari
ous ships and then w
ould go to meet the 
ship and try to get a story and so at some 
point that, first of a
ll, the mo rning of our 
arrival, lots of hoopla, ev
erybody was saying, oh, you've got
 to look, there is Long 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 21 
 
 
Island, so some people were saying they we
re going to live on that long island, cause 
you could see the land mass sticking out and 
Freddy and I, we said
, no, no, we, we're 
not going to live on Long Island, we're liv
ing at 503 Fifth Ave
nue, which was the 
address my  mo ther had hammered into our 
heads, cause that was where the optical 
office was, Kurz Optical was 
there, so we told everybody we were going to be living 
at 503 Fifth Avenue.  Some man came up, w
ho turned out to be a reporter and who 
wanted to take our pictures, so he cast 
about for an interesting shot and found the 

lifeboy, the round lifeboy that says Grippe
sholm(ph) on it and pos
ed Freddy and me 
with our faces through it and took pictures 
which later appeared in the New York 
Times and which I have copies.  And me
 wearing one glove 
on the impetigo hand, 
yes.  My hair, which was still very short 
because of the lice a
nd all, it hadn't grown 
back comp letely yet.  I was very small,
 I, you know, the differen
ce in heights, Freddy 
and me and what we were and where we got 
to be shortly afterwar
d is quite dramatic 
as we, we grew a lot.  
When my  Uncle Benjamin was allowed on board, which was 
pretty early on because we were alone, tw
o children alone, traveling, he found us 
perched on top of the railing of 
the ship.  I mean that reporter has, had sat us the top 
of the railing of the ship, w
ithout any regard for our safety and Uncle Benjamin came 
up, gave that man a real piece 
of his mind.  So lots of hoopla, we had a suitcase, we 
came down off the gangplank, through that big 
pier, where my , two of my  aunts were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 22 
 
 
waiting for me. 
Q: This was at Ellis Island? 

A: No, it was no more Ellis Island, st
raight into the docks in New York? 
Q: It would have been then, Battery Park? 

A: No, I think it was not, I think it was in 
the 20's or the teens,
 it was on one of the 
lower slips, one of the lower berths.  And my
 father's sister, my 
Aunt Lola was there 
to meet us and as well as Charlie's wife Ka
rola(ph), the three had come to meet us on 
the ship and vividly I rememb er 
that as soon as I left that large pier, that building, my  

first step to the outside, I 
bumped into somebody who cursed me out very roundly.  I 
mu st have stepped on her toe or something,
 but.  And so then we took a taxi to 
Brighton(ph) Beach, Brooklyn, where my Un
cle Benjamin and my Aunt Lillian, 
whom we call Aunt Leah, where they lived
, in Brighton(ph) Beach
, they lived in a 
two room apartment, living room and a be
droom.  They had two children, Diana, 
who's my  age and Vivian who was two.  
And Diana was in camp, this was August 
the fifth, she was in camp for the summer 
and Vivian was home, she was a little girl. 
Q: Were these people who you had not ye
t met, except for your Uncle Benjamin? 
A: I had not met my  Uncle Benjamin, that 
is to say, now within my recollection, 

actually they had met me, but I was very 
small, then by the 
time they went to 
America, I was, last time I saw them I was 
two and a half or some
thing, so they knew 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 23 
 
 
me, but I didn't know them.  So this was,
 my  Uncle Benjamin had not been to 
Europe, it was my Uncle Charlie who came to
 Europe.  My Uncle Benjamin and my  
Aunt Leah, whom I lived with
, who I was to live with, I ha
d not met them.  So this 
was my first meeting with them. 
Q: So your connection with your brother, as
 you've mentioned many times before, at 
this point was crucial to your feeling at home? 

A: Very mu ch so, very mu ch so.  And 
then you know how it is when you, when you 
enter a new family, there are, if children ar
e especially children 
who are the same age 
and Diana and I are three months apart,
 there are lots of adjustments and 
accommodations that children have to make and 
there are, there is lots of power play 
that goes on and where before Diana was 
queen in her own castle, except for a two 

year old sister and you know, there were ei
ght years between her and her sister, she 
came back from camp to find two siblings 
of the same age and it was a very rough 
adjustment and there was a lot of politicki
ng among the three of us
 as alliances got 
pushed and pulled.  And so certainly my , my
 feeling of needing my  brother were, or 
using him in alliances certainly, that was intensified.   

Q: And the language? 

A: Well, yes, that, lots of things to be 
said about that.  To our great good fortune, my  

Aunt Leah had spent some years of 
her young womanhood in Holland, so she spoke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 24 
 
 
Dutch.  I spoke German pretty
 fluently and indeed still do,
 it's a children's German.  If 
you want to engage me in a 
conversation about genetics, I 
won't do so well, but if you 
want to talk about the ordinary, every day 
things, I'm pretty fl
uent.  You know, what 
children tend to talk about I can do pre
tty well and so I didn't have a problem 
communicating because both Benjamin and Leah spoke German, Leah spoke Dutch. 
And I want to tell you that 
a child left to his or her own devices picks up a language 
very quickly.  I arrived here on August the fi fth, I went to school
 at the beginning of 
September and by that time I s
poke English.  And it's true, I mean, they got a lady to 

come in and teach us something, but th
at didn't do a whole lot, the truth is... 
Q: Did you also study in Sweden? 

A: No.  The truth is, a child 
that goes, it's one of the reasons I feel so very strongly 
against what is happening in the school syst
em to allow children to stay in their 

native language.  A child left to his ow
n devices picks up a language, a young child, 
very quickly.  English was my  third langua
ge.  I had started school in Brighton(ph) 
Beach, Brooklyn, at PS 225, with Mr
s. Field, in class 5A.  I will say that in the course 
of that first term, I, I got to speak English 
fluently.  I didn't get to write it perfectly 
well, in fact I have compositions from that 
first half year and the English is funny, 
cause I write what I hear.  All of a sudde
n I wrote as A-l-f-e-r-s-u-d-d-e-n, all of a 
sudden.  And lots of my compositions 
which were kept from that time are funny 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 25 
 
 
because you can see that I s
poke it all right, I just didn't know what I was saying and 
so I wrote it.  By the way, Dutch is a 
very exact language, you write exactly what you 
hear, so I tried doing that in English and of 
course that, it's amusing to read now.  But 
anyway by the time it became a
pparent it was impossible in two rooms for six people 
to live, we moved to Kew Gardens and into
 a little house and then 
the second half of 
my  fifth grade I had in, I started Kew Gardens in a new school.   
Q: So you came and you started in what grade? 

A: In 5A.  I was just going to say someth
ing about that, I, before we were deported 
to, to concentration camps, I had only had the 
first grade.  And that was it.  I think I 
had a couple of weeks of the second grade a
nd then after the war, 
after we came back 
in Rainin(ph), I, they
, they kind of, I mean lots of 
children had, had not had proper 
schooling and I kind of had the 
third grade, sort of.  And 
then we left that in the 
middle, see and then we came to America 
and in Sweden I didn't go to school of 

course and then, it was only over the summe
r, was only a few months.  And then I 
came here and they tested me
 and I went into the fifth grade, which was the proper 
grade for a 10 year old to go 
into.  And of course, education in Europe is a little 
different.  In first grade we had learne
d addition, subtracti
on, multiplication and 
division and so by the time after the war, wh
en I was trying to play catch up in the 
third grade, other children also did that.  
When I came to Ameri
ca,  children in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 26 
 
 
fifth grade were about to l
earn long division, which I knew 
how to do, so they put me 
into the fifth grade and the tr
uth is I learned English very quickly.  I mean the part of 
the curriculum that I was b
ackwards on was history because in America they only 
learn history of the United States in the 
early grades and I kne
w nothing.  Geography 
of the United States, course I didn't know a
nything about that and literature because I 
had not read children's books, but I was a vor
acious reader and loved reading.  So, 
what I'm, what I'm ending up with here, so
 when we moved to Kew Gardens and we 

were registered in PS 99, I vividly rememb er
 that first morning 
after the, my Aunt 
Leah took us in and registered us and 
the principal called for some young girl who 
brought us to our classrooms. 
 I was brought into my  5B classroom feeling very self-
conscious, school was more formal in thos
e days, everybody was sitting at their seat 
with their hands clasped and the little girl 
brought me in to the class and my teacher 
turned to the class and said, 
"Now this is a little orphan gi
rl from Europe.  She doesn't 
speak any English and I want 
you all to be very nice to her."  And of course I spoke 
English quite as well as anyone else, possibl
y with a little bit of 
an accent, but I had a 
dilemma because I didn't know whether to ma
ke her into a liar or whether I should 

just keep my  mouth shut and not let 
her know that I spoke pretty fluently. 
Q: I assume that she was not Jewish? 

A: No, she was not Jewish, but I, but I mean
 she, she didn't mean this badly, she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 27 
 
 
really thought that I was not able to conve
rse and she was going to try to make my  
transition easier, but of course I spoke it flue
ntly and I had a problem afterwards with 
how to, how to handle that.  
So I went to school sketchily in my  early years but it 
didn't do me any harm and I graduated 
valedictorian in the eight grade. 
Q: Did the, did the students and teachers 
have any idea about your past, about where 
you had come from, what you had been through? 
A: I, I don't think the students certainly did. 
 At some point my teacher did, she, my 
teacher also was the quote, sewing teacher 
for the school and so one afternoon when 
we had sewing, she got me as
ide and had me tell her the story and so I know she was 
curious and she had me talk a
bout it.  But listen, it isn't just that those children didn't 

know about it, people didn't talk a bout it here, nobody talked about it.  

Q: Your family neither? 

A: In my family, my parents were part of
 the conversation because my father was my 
Uncle Benjamin's brother and my  mo ther and 
my  Aunt Leah had b
een best friends in 
the time they were young wives and they'd  ha
d their children togeth
er and spent a lot 
of time in each other's comp
any, so the conversation wa
s much about the times gone 
by.  But not, they did not tr
y to draw me out on the experiences during the war.  Once 
in awhile they got into the conversation 
or I would mention something, but they 
didn't try to make me talk about it.  A
nd certainly, other people, outsiders of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 28 
 
 
family, this was not a subject
 of conversation, first of 
all, many Jewish people who 
we knew had similar histories.  Everybody, I 
guess, had lost people.  It was a subject 
very painful for a lot of people, it was raw, 
it was part of their own lives, or else they 
had lost people to these kind of
 things and there was I think also a feeling that they'v e 
been through enough, why should we
 make them talk about it.  It's only really in the 
1980's that this became a subject for genera
l conversation, it was 
not done.  And there 
was also a feeling, certainly in the 50's, 40'
s and 50's that one trie
d to shield children 
from hearing bad things, it wasn't like now 
when violence is an every day thing on 
the TV.  It would not, you, one would not 
have put a child in the position of telling 
other children about these experiences, 
it would have been deemed not proper. 
Q: Between the fifth and the eighth grad
e, was the eighth grade where you were 
valedictorian? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you know other Jewish children? 

A: I would venture... 

Q: Other then your relatives? 

A: I would venture to say that my  school
 in Kew Gardens was 80 percent Jewish. 
Maybe not 80 perhaps in those years it 
was 60 percent Jewish.  We certainly 
wouldn't, my  aunt and uncle
 would not have moved into
 a community that did not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 29 
 
 
have synagogues and you know a
nd other Jewish children. 
Q: Was going to the synagogue an important part of your life? 
A: Absolutely, absolutely.  
I, we were affiliated, I went to the Hebrew school after 
school, five, four days a week.  Went to 
the synagogue on Saturday mo rning, did that 
even when no one else went.  Both Fr
eddy and I did that.  And Freddy was Bar 
Mitzvahed at there and I became active wh
en I was old enough to
 do that, ___ being 
a leader in the youth center and you know, it 
was very mu ch a focal point of my  
existence.  I retained the observance as 
I thought my  mo ther w
ould have wanted me 
to and Freddy was a little bit more lax about
 that as boys are w
ont to do and that 
caused me some aggravation and it was impor
tant enough for me so that when I went 
to high school, Forest Hills
 High School, the social life revolved around sororities, 
which meant Friday nights.  I 
did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider, 

I was an oddball and I had ambitions for th
e stage and joined play production and 
eventually did get a role or
 two and walked from my  house in Kew Gardens to those 
performances in Forest Hills
 High School on Friday night 
and Saturday and did that 
with a lot of trepidation.  And religion 
has remained to this
 day, certainly an 
important thing, important core in my life. 

Q: How about being an American, was ther
e a point at which or can you identify a 
point which you began to feel like an American? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 30 
 
 
A: I pretty quickly, I pretty 
quickly internalized some Amer
ican things that made me 
feel good about America.  For 
one thing, I want to remind you, that in the 1940's and 
'50's, children entered school in the mo rn
ing, stood up and pledge
d allegiance to the 
flag every day and stood up when the flag 
came, when you heard the Star Spangled 
Banner and those of us, not ju
st those of us who were 
refugees and came here, but 
people of that era, to this day, are mo re pa
triotic, if such a thi
ng is possible to say, 
than young people who are growi
ng up today.  We tend to honor the flag and all that. 
 In addition to that, my  Uncle Benjamin 
thought of America as 
the land of savior, you 
know, they were, they were also refugees as
 was all my  family, I mean we were all, 
my  whole family, there was nobody really 
in America, everybody was in Europe. 
And I have correspondence from my  parents 
to their family and friend, hundreds of 
letters that got saved and se
nt and kept with my  mo ther
's artifacts, with non-Jews 
during the war and I, I have possession of t
hose.  And I've spent really hours looking 
at those and what emerges from them is th
is tremendous feeling of people that are 
bound up with hundreds, a far flung family, 
you married and you then acquired your 
spouse 

s family as well and your spouse's spouse's. 
 They drew in their family and then you 
became family with the spouse's spouse's spouse'
s.  And so I have 
letters like that, the 
middle of a tremendous network, it was a very
 close merging of family and friends, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 31 
 
 
mean it was one thing.  And so when all of
 that got stopped one day by that maniac in 
Germany and everybody tried to
 get out, those who made it and who made it here 
and who worked hard and reestablished th
emselves, my Uncle Benjamin came here 
with a few dollars in his 
hands one day, got on the subway from Brooklyn, where he 
was dropped off after he arrived here, took th
e subway, which, I mean he didn't even 
know his way, had heard about
 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue
, got instruction how to 
go there, found an office on the fifth floor
 walkup and opened hi
s office and he and 
he became a successful optical wholesaler 
again, you know.  He considered America 
as the golden land, the land th
at had saved him.  He c
onsidered President Truman 
somewhere up there with the deities.  And th
ere was a lot of talk about that, I mean 
we respected America as I did as a la
nd that had given us, you know, a chance to 
come and to, to work and so we were very
 patriotic.  I remind you also that not until 
20 years later was there any criticism above the president at 
the time, President 

Roosevelt and the Congress for not, 
you know, opening up th
e door and saving 
people, which of course in retrospect we 
all realize should have 
happened but at that 
time, I mean we went, everyone, all the Jewi
sh refugees and the non-Jewish refugees 

who came to America after th
e war found this a land of 
opportunity and equality and 
you know, place where you could start and di
dn't matter what you had been, if you 
wanted to become something you could and we
 were very patriotic about that and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 32 
 
 
internalized that very fast
.  I became a citizen on my, at
 my own right, since I had no 
parents, so you know, I had to and I was,
 I was old enough  so requirements for 
citizenship for me were until 
I was 18 I was not a citizen so at the age of 18 I was 
sworn in, in Abbot's(ph) field, I went with Freddy. 

Q: But Freddy couldn't? 

A: No, Freddy became a citizen in his ow
n right when he became 18.  The ceremony 

was in Abbot's(ph) field, was crowded, cr
owded, it was a beautiful day, I was sworn 
in and somewhere, along with the other 
20,000 people who were there, we all stood 
and we took the oath, I was very proud to
 do that and some reporter was roaming 
around saying, "Anybody here have an intere
sting story?"  You know, but I wasn't 
going to push my self forward on th
at, but as he went past me, I said to him, "Well, I 
was interviewed when I came here."  He said
, "Oh," and he, and he
 took my  story, so 
I have an article about me on the day I cam
e to the United States
 with picture and I 
have an article about me on the day I became a citizen. 

Q: Do you rememb er the date? 

A: No.  I know it was in th
e spring and the sun was shining and it was Abbot's(ph) 
field. 

Q: Let's go to the other side.  We're moving now to tape two.

Q: Not only becoming 18 is a major passage
 of life, but becoming an American 
citizen is a major passage of life and how 
your life proceeded into a new passage and 
how maybe the past always had some influence on that, from there. 
A: Well, after high school, I went to college
.  For a lot of reasons I did not pursue 
going out of town.  A lot of reasons and I 
applied to Queens College and I applied to 
Barnett(ph) here in New York, women's unde
rgraduate part of Columb ia University 
and I was accepted Barnard with a scholarsh
ip, a partial scholarship, Freddy was still 
in Kew Gardens, living there, his last y
ear of high school and so I commu ted.  In 
those years it was still possible to put your
self through college, a thing that is no 
longer possible, but when I started Barn
ard it was 823 dollars a year.  I had a 350 
dollar scholarship.  I had received so
mething called a general ____ foundation 
scholarship when I gradua
ted high school, which paid 
me 25 dollars a semester, 
which I used toward textbooks
, in the plural, cause you could do that cause we went 
to use, to buy used textbooks, it was possi
ble.  I worked at the synagogue youth 

center and made money that way.  I work
ed summers as drama counselor in camps, 

so that I got paid mo re than other couns
eloring jobs.  And I 
took a job every single 
June with Olsen's(ph) Temporary Service. 
 And it was quite possible to, if you, if you 
had your living taken care of
 and I was living in Kew Gardens and eating, for a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 34 
 
 
young person to go to school and pay their tuiti
on with the help of a scholarship, that 
was quite possible.  Course it would not have
 been possible if, if I could not  have 
lived at home in, in Kew Gard
ens, but even the tuition, which is unthinkable today, I 
mean no young person can possibly do that, but
 that was possible so I went to 
Barnard and spent the four years there. 
 Never felt myself to be very pretty... 
Q: You're kidding? 
A: Certainly in high school I felt odd man 
out and my  friends were oddballs, we, I 
was not, I tried to belong to the in crowd, I, I never quite could.  
In Forest Hills High 
School they took, at the end of our freshman 
year, they, they culled out of the student 
body of 800 I think approximately 
of my  year, they took 36 of us whom they tested at 
the end of the first year, based on our achieve
ment of the first year and they put us 
together for all the math and science of the 
balance of the four y
ears, they tried to 
give us five years in four.  
And so I kind of traveled with 
the elite intellects of, of, of 
the class, for those four years and I was al
ways a studier, school didn't come easy, I, I 
always had to work very hard, I spent 
a lot of hours studying, as opposed to my  

brother.  My brother used to come home a
nd comp lain that every, he had too mu ch 
work, everything was too mu ch work and th
en he'd  sit down like for 15 or 20 minutes 
with the pencil writing furiously and thenone time I looked up a
nd he was   putting 
on his sneakers and I said, "Where are you goi
ng?"  And he said, "I'm going to play 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 35 
 
 
basketball in the schoolyard and I said, 
"Well, you've just, you've just been 
comp laining you have too mu ch work , so 
what are you doing?"  He said, "Well now 
I've made a schedule and what to do and 
I know when I'm studying for what, so now 
this is the schedule for playing ball."  S
ee now, I never was able
 to do that, see I 
would get nervous and 
bite my  nails and work and study, so, there were some people 
in that group of thirty-something that they
 culled out, that really were extremely 
gifted in math and in science and I didn't 
have an easy time hanging on, but I did very 
well in high school, I graduated 
the 10th, I think in, in, in the 800, I was number 10, I 
think I had a 92.8 average or something like th
at, I was fine and so
 I had been pretty 
spoiled cause I'd done pretty well, all of my
 school years, I was, I was always an A 
student and in fact, I tell you 
what I rememb er, in the first grade, my  mo ther made a 
big fuss, because in Europe their marking 
system was to 10, I mean 100 was 10.  I 
brought back my  report card in first grade, 
I had a 10 in everything and an eight in 
penmanship and she wouldn't let me forget 
that.  It was only in
 later years that I 
found a copy of my  mo ther's report cards in elementary school, she was definitely a C 

student all the way, which I thought was qu
ite extraordinary. 
 But anyway, I was 
spoiled and I had, I had alwa
ys had an easy time in school. 
 I went into Barnard and I 
was not happy.  I was outclassed by a mile.  
Barnard had, certainly at that time, a 
large percentage of it's students had come
 from private schools.  I was a product of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 36 
 
 
the public school system and most of it, Fo
rest Hills High School, 
was definitely one 
of the top high schools in the city, but 
we had done things 
by rote.  ____ you learn 
something, you memo rized it, you took a test
 and you spewed it back out.  I got to 
college, I had to write a term
 paper, I had never written a term paper in my life, I 
didn't even know how to go about it.  I 
mean, what we wrote were mo re like 
compositions, but there were no term paper, 
a research paper?  I hadn't the foggiest 
notion.  I had girls in the class who had 
been doing independent 
research at Barnard 
you know, people who really knew what they
 were doing and I, I 
was under pressure 
to maintain my scholar
ship and I hadn't yet learned how to sift out the important stuff 
from the unimportant, so I tried very hard to
 keep up on all of it and you couldn't.  So, 
I had no time while I was in college to lear
n anything.  I, I just spend my  time doing, 
but not learning and I regret that a lot.  
I don't have good recollec
tions of those four 
years, they were very tense all the tim
e.  When I was gr
owing up and I knew I 
couldn't be an actress cause it would not 
work well with my, with my religious 
inclinations not to work on Saturday, 
I probably wouldn't ha
ve made a go of it 
anyway, but anyway, I, I, I gave up my  pr
etensions for that, I decided to be a 
schoolteacher, I had worked w
ith children all of my life when I could have been 
considered not a child.  I'd done the youth 
service and camps and I really was very 
good with children and I was going to be a 
schoolteacher.  So when I came out of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 37 
 
 
Barnard, I, I became a teacher of the fifth 
grade.  I had done my student teaching at 
the Dalton School and then taught fifthgrade at Ridgewood, which is on the 
Brooklyn-Queens borderline.  And somewhere in 
that first year I decided that all my  

life I had been in a classroom.  I started out
 on one side of the 
desk and now I was on 
the other side of the desk and I was curious
 to see what life was like in New York as 
a grown person, not in a classr
oom.  So I decided to take a year off.  I took that trip, 
this was now, I graduated college in '58, 
so I taught school for '58 to summer '59 and 
I went to Europe and Israel, that was 
that, that summer, that
 trip.  Freddy had 

graduated college that year a
nd he also, he decided not to wait, to work a year, he 
decided to, to go to Europe that year too, we
 went separately.  He left before me and 
he took a ship across and then he rented
 a car on the continent, a little Renault 
Defeen(ph), which looks like a 
tin can that you can pick up.  But I had already been 
working for a year and I d
ecided to do it, Freddy was goi
ng to stay at youth hostels 
all over and my mother's mother, my grandmot
her was alive in Israel still at that time 
and we decided to comb ine our trips, individual trips to Europe
 by meeting in Rome 
towards the end of the summer 
and going to Israel together
 to visit my  grandmother, 
whom we knew, she had come to America in
 the intervening year
s to visit with my 
mo ther's sister, my  Aunt Mary and had 
gone back to Israel and so we went 
individually to Europe
 and Freddy, we, we went to see Freddy off on the ship on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 38 
 
 
day that he sailed and he also was seen 
off by the lady who became my sister-in-law, 
Rachel and that was really wh
en I first realized that sh
e might very well be, become 
my sister-in-law.  And 
Freddy and I had agreed to give each other messages 
whenever we were in a city, by leaving each
 other messages in the American Express 
offices, so that whenever we
 came, because that's where we picked up mail in those 
years.  If you went around with a very 
loose itinerary, you know
, I knew I was going 
to England and then from England to Ho
lland and from Holland to
 France and he had 
his loose schedule, without 
knowing what hotels we were 
going to, but so that was 
how people frequently communicated.  And so
 I did that and he did that and we 
would find messages from each other.  And then
 I left a message for him when I got 
to Geneva.  I got to Geneva on a Friday a
nd on Saturday he appeared in my , in my  

hotel because he had gone to
 American Express, picked
 up and, and he found my 
note and he knew where I was staying, so we
 decided then to tr
avel from Switzerland 
through Italy to Rome together, since we we
re supposed to meet 
in Rome anyway in 
a matter of two weeks.  I didn't have a car
 and he had the Renault Defeen(ph).  We 
should have never done that, bad mistake.  
Because we left Geneva the next day and 
got into a car accident almost immediately.
  Poor Freddy, he really felt very bad 
about that.   We were dr
iving along on a country lane, there was a tiny little car in 
front of us and that man sudde
nly made a left turn, into a 
field of wheat.  I mean we, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 39 
 
 
we, we, it was just, we didn't know there was a 
road there, to make a left turn and we 
banged into him with our little
 tin can, I was thrown up against the windshield and 
broke my  nose.  Actually we didn't know 
I broke my  nose, but 
I was bleeding and, 
and I said to Freddy, whose German was 
not terrific any mo re, I said, "Don't worry 
about it, I'll handle it."  And out of the ca
r, like a little circus car, came this huge man. 
And he spoke what is known 
as SwitzerDutch(ph), which isabsolutely not related to 
the German that I, I mean I couldn't unde
rstand him, he couldn't understand me, it 
was a terrible situation.  Anyway we got it 
sorted out, we were towed and we got into 
a hotel near Lausanne and 
had to lay up there for three days while the car was 
repaired.  Some lady doctor came to the hot
el, assured me my  nose was not broken, 
but it really was, cause I have the, I can feel 
it to this day.  And in the course of those 
three days, it was Freddy's birthday.  We we
nt to the top of the yungfrau(ph) together 
and we fought terribly and cam
e evening times, I mean my  brother was a 22 year old 
young man on the loose in Eur
ope and he wanted to have a good time, but he felt 
responsible for the sister so he starte
d hanging around with me in the evening, it 
didn't work.  At three days we decided th
is was not good and he 
went his way and I 
went my  way by train and we met up in Rome
, as we were planned to and then went 
to Israel happily together and then 
drove back afterwards to Paris and... 
Q: Your meeting with your grandmother, was it special? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 40 
 
 
A: It was very special, my  grandmother wa
s actually, whom we had seen a few years 
before that, my  grandmother was living in Is
rael with her son, my  mo ther's brother 
and his family, in Tel Aviv.  And actually 
I had never met my , my  mo ther's brother, 

my  uncle Elias(ph) and his family and so it 
was a very, very special 10 days that we 
were all together.  And it was my
 first trip to Israel and that was a exciting thing.  As 
I told you, my  mo ther had rehearsed Freddy 
and me in addresses, in case we were 
separated during the war a
nd one address was 503 Fifth 
Avenue and the other one 
was 108 Benyahuda(ph) Street, wh
ich was in Tel Aviv, which 
was her brother.  So of 
course my  mo ther had told 
us a lot about her family there and my  Uncle Elias(ph), 
her, her, her brother and his children, one 
of whom was close in age to Freddy and 
me.  And so it was a very nice experience and 
the first of my visits to Israel.  And 
when I came back to Ameri
ca after that summer, I told you I had decided to take 
some time out from teaching and I decided to
 make myself available to the business 
world.  So, having been an 
academic students, not what we used to call commercial 
students in those days, you we
nt to high school, you either
 got an academic diploma 
or a commercial diploma, I of course was 
academic, I had always stuck my nose up at 
things like typing and shorth
and and had a three finger me
thod of typing my  papers 
in college.  So when I offered my self 
to the business world, you see, nobody wanted 
me.  They all wanted to know what I coul
d do.  I said, "Well what do you mean, what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 41 
 
 
I can do, I'm intelligent, I'm 
a Barnard graduate, I was a teacher."  And they would 
say, "Yes, yes, but what can you do, can 
you type?  Can you do shorthand?"  Again I 
want to tell you, this is the 50's now.  
Freddy went to Columb ia and I went to 
Barnard.  When he graduated, the recruite
rs came to Columbia and be interviewed by 
the young men graduating.  On my  side of 
Broadway there was no such a thing as a 
recruiter, our top English graduate got a sc
holarship to I think, secretarial school. 
When a girl wanted to go into publishing,
 she was advised she should go in as a 
typist or secretary and work her way up.  
I venture to say not a 
boy was told that.  I 
think too, even, even at Barnard and Barnar
d really has a tradition 
of professional, of 
women who be, who've entered the professi
ons, but mo st, mo st of them did not do 
that.  I mean not very many went to 
medical school or law school, law school 
certainly not in those years.  
It's only in retrospect thatI realize I should have gone to 
law school, a thought that never entered my
 mind and I probably would have been 
good as a lawyer, because my mi
nd works that way.  But at those, in those years, 
certainly, there were things women, pr
ofessions like teaching that women thought 
about readily and the others you didn't.  We
 concentrated mo re 
on working and, and 
getting married and having children and so
 we weren't fixated on careers for a 
lifetime, we were interested in havi
ng interesting work experiences, but not 
necessarily lifetime careers.  There was 
a lot of talk about teaching is a good 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 42 
 
 
profession cause you get the summers off, you 
know, that kind of thing.  Certainly 
that has been a great thing of the women's m
ovement I think, the fact that women are, 
are, are encouraged to thi
nk about working as a fulfillment of life, perhaps not all 

good in the sense of what happens
 to children today, but certainly, if I think back, that 
it never dawned on my, you know, to go fo
r...  And this was from a school where 
there was a lot of emphasis on that, the pres
ident of Barnard at the time was a woman 
who encouraged that a lot.  So... 

Q: So Freddy was at Columbia and 
you were at Barnard, still together... 
A: Well... 

Q: In parallel. 

A: Well together in the sense that, you know, 
if we were not going out of town, if we 
were not going to be going out 
of town and staying in Ne
w York, then, in terms of 
Ivy League schools or the top of the heap
, there was Columb ia and, and since we 
were not going to be able to 
dorm, mo st of the people who graduated with us, if they 
did not dorm, went on to Queen's College
, you know, in their backyards and then, 
you know, lived at home, if you're going to liv
e at home, that was as close as we 
came, so, yeah we were together, but that 
was really not because we were together, 

it's because we both were able to qualify 
for top schools and, and that was the top 
school, certainly within commu
ting distance, I commu ted every day, it was mo re than 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 43 
 
 
an hour each way. 
Q: And he still lived in the home also? 

A: He lived at home also. 

Q: And after his graduating... 

A: Well he took, you see he, 
he, my  mo ther had, my  mo ther's brother in Israel, 
Elias(ph) had been trained as 
an engineer and my  mo ther got
 it into her head early on, 
she used to tell, Freddy used to be found 
with hammers and nails and taking things 
apart and exploring so she al
ways said he's going to be an engineer just like her 
brother and I guess that stuck in his mind and 
he in fact took a five year engineering 
program at Columb ia and, which they were ab
le to do in four years, he came out with 
a BS instead of a BA, having done two y
ears in the engineering school and he 
graduated with an engineering 
degree as, so yes, then he graduated the year after me 
and he announced that he was going to get 
married to that young lady, who name is 

Rachel and she is his wife today, they have
 three children, live in
 New Jersey, Cherry 
Hill, New Jersey and that is where he has liv ed, really since he graduated, he, at the 

end of college the recruiters came and Fr
eddy accepted a job with RCA which was in 
Camden, New Jersey.  To my great relief 
because he had spe
nd time in California 
and all that and I was terrified that he 
was going to move to 
California and I guess I 
would have moved with him by that time.  
So when they were married, they moved 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 44 
 
 
in commuting distance to hi
s work in, in, in Camd
en, so they moved to 
Haddenfield(ph) in the Cherry Hill area 
and have moved, you know, from that little 
garden apartment into a house 
and then into the home that 
they still occupy in Cherry 
Hill.  They had, eventually
, three children, the oldest, Natalie, who is now 30 years 
old and the two twins, who were born triple
ts, and were triplets for a few days and 
those young ladies are now going to be 28 a
nd the twins are married and Natalie will 
get married this September.  Th
ey are the love of my life.  My sister-in-law and my 
brother have been very generous in letti
ng me share in those children's upbringing, I, 
I did it with malice aforethought, I made th
em my little dumplings from the time that 
they recognized me and have spent a lot of
 time with them, took them on cruises and 
trips to the Caribbean in their growi
ng up years and in ge
neral, you know, have 
inveigled myself into their hearts and lives, 
so that to this day, they are my friends 
and indeed, the oldest one, Na
talie, lives in an apartment 
that I own not far from here, 
the one that I lived in before I moved here
.  And she live on 58th Street and since she 

is now a grown woman, I have been very 
fortunate in having he
r not only live near 
me, but like me enough to make me her frie
nd and so we, we do th
ings together, we 
go to the opera and the theater together 
and you know, I, I don't have children of my  
own, a thing that I mind a lot.  And the fact
 that I've had these three children and my 
sister-in-law has generously allowed me to
 really be part of their lives and not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 45 
 
 
resented me for that.  Being an aunt, 
you know, it, it's like being a grandparent, I 
guess, it's the best of all possible worl
ds, you have none of the responsibility for 
discipline and all the opportunity for br
ibery by being nice and so, you know, if a 
mo ther and father are resentful, it can make
 that hard.  Rachel and Freddy have been 
very generous and have allowe
d me to do my bit with them
, so that they'v e been as 
close as, you know, it is possible for nieces to be. 
Q: I have nieces also, I relate, identify with
 what you're talking a
bout.  I, I wanted to 
ask you something that you had talked about 
before and that was that there was time 
when no one talked about these experi
ences and you, you mentioned the 80's and 
how, when people started talking.  When 
people started talking, for instance with 
your nieces, have you talked w
ith them, have they aske
d you or when did you begin 
to feel that it was, was all right for you to talk about this? 

A: I always thought so, I, I 
never had a problem talking about it, but you know, it's 

not something you, you didn't 
go around playing with your fri
ends and say, oh by the 
way, do you know that this and this, what
  happened to me, I mean it was not, you 
just didn't do that.  But when
 it came up, I, I have always considered the war years a 
part of my life in the following way, first 
of all, my  recollection of my  parents in 

intimately bound up with that.  I mean I 
can't separate the war years from my  
recollections of my mother and my father 
and so I certainly was, I guess I've made 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 46 
 
 
that clear by now that I, I find my, my mother
's memo ry to be a very important thing 
to me and I had no intention of glossing ove
r her life or my  recollection of her life 
and, and that's part and par
cel of those years, so I have
 never had difficulty thinking 
back, cause I have always wanted to remember
 her and that's part of it and I've really 
not ever had a problem discussing it, I've
 never found that I broke down or couldn't 
talk about it in any way.  I've
 always been able to do that
, I felt, in the early years, 
certainly in the 50's, as a child, you don'
t want to be different so you don't call 
attention to those kinds of th
ings and as a, as a grown up 
I always try to make sure 
that if the subject came up that I didn't 
bore people to tears with it or you know, had 
them morbidly interested in
 me as a freak of some ki
nd, but I never minded talking 
about it.  I always thought, you 
know, that that was okay.  
Q: Was there talk, was there room, was th
ere space, I'm talking about a kind of a 
intellectual, emotional space within the 
context of your religious community, the 
synagogue, to talk about, was this an important... 

A: No, again, you asked first about my  cla
ss, were there other 
Jews, that I, did know 
other Jews besides my  family?  Well, 
for the mo st part you know, people tend to 

move where there are people like them
, so I don't know where you're from but 

certainly Jewish people tend to
 move to communities, esp
ecially observant Jews, tend 
to move to communities where 
there are other observant Jews, so we did that, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 47 
 
 
was Kew Gardens.  There were no other re
fugees from the war in
 my  school when I 
went to that school, not children who actually 
were survivors.  There were children of 
children who were survivors, but not actual 
children, so Freddy a
nd I were different 
in that way, but you know, ____ when it 
came to our synagogue, I guess 80 percent 
of them had fled Hitler at some point 
between the 30's and the 40's and so the 
difference again was that the 
children in my  synagogue, again were not the survivors, 
but their, but their parents we
re the survivors so this wasn't strange for anyone.  I 
don't know if you know but in the Jewish relig
ion there is a memo rial prayer for the 
dead that is said on the fes
tival holidays, on the last day 
of the festival holidays and it 
is traditional for the people who still have pa
rents to not remain inside the sanctuary 
at the time that this is said, 
so they go out and they come b
ack in after that prayer is 
said.  Well I was very conscious of the fact
, in the growing up years that there weren't 
any other children that hung around for that pr
ayer.  But in no other way, I think the 
people, when we first moved in, since ev
erybody was refugees, my  family were also 
refugees and there wasn't much
 made of that.  Some people knew that of course I did 
not call the adults with me 
mo th er an d  fath er o r  mo m a
nd dad, but aunt and uncle. 
And so, but there was a tim
e when that was  pretty common among survivors you 

know, so yeah, there's, it didn't beco
me a commonplace today, you know, when 
people hear that I am a survivor, I, I noti
ce their pupils dilate and they look at me

with a newfound interest, even people I've know
n.  I got a call about a year ago, from 
my accountant.  I have a business in New Yo
rk now and I have an accountant.  When 
I started with this accountant he was a young 
man of no consequence.  Now he's the 
biggest accounting firm on Long Island.  A
nd I don't have day to day contact with 
him, I work with somebody who is employe
d by him.  Well, I 
got a phone call and it 
said, "Miss Kurz?  Hold the phone for a mo
ment for Mr. Isrelloff(
ph)."  So I got, I 
held on the the phone and Bob Isrelloff(ph) cam
e on.  "Hey," he said, "Dorian(ph), I 
just came back from Washington, I visited 
the Holocaust Museum and I pushed some 
buttons on an interacting and I was just am
azed, there was a name 
there, Dorian(ph) 
Kurz and I said to myself, well there can
 only be one of thos
e and I pressed the 
button and there you were on the screen, I 
had no idea."  Well, now Bob Isrelloff(ph) 
hasn't made a call to me in perhaps 20 year
s, you see, but the fact
 that I was one of 
the survivors caught his interest and that ha
s happened to me a couple of times.  It is 
now that people find you intere
sting or oddball or noteworthy, if you are a survivor. 
In the 40's and 50's this was not notewor
thy, it was more commonplace.  You ask 
about my nieces and whether they were, when
 they were growing up, were interested. 

I will tell you that when I was invited to
 do the, the histor
y for the Holocaust 
Museum, which I, the visual one that I gave
 in 1990, one of the 
reasons that I was 
keen on doing it was not so much for histor
ical reasons, because I knew there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 49 
 
 
many people who could give thei
r histories, but one of th
e reasons I wanted to do it 
was because I was told I would have a copy 
of that tape and I wanted my brother's 
children to have that visual
 story because again, growi
ng up, I mean children are not 
very interested.  You know, when, I was bor
n in the year 1936.  When people talk 
about the first World War, I glaze over a little 
bit, it's somewhere 
there before I was 
born and you know how things are before you we
re born, they're ancient history, they 
have no relevance.  Well, my
 nieces were born, not just 
after World War 2, but a long 
time after World, World War 2, World War 
1, what do they know one from the other 
or the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, 
the Crimean War, I mean it's all one to 
people who weren't living at 
that time and I want them to know the story and I was 
anxious for them to have a c
opy of it.  And, so that was definitely one of the reasons 
that I was keen to do that visual histor
y.  And that made 
me think about other 
children who maybe didn't have 
an aunt or a father who 
were survivors, who should 
have an opportunity, if they link in, to, to
 get stories, you know, even in 200 years. 
We, we hear today, stories about the Re
volutionary War and we don't relate to it 
directly and we don't have Ge
orge Washington or the soldie
rs of the continental army  
to really talk about it.  It
 would make it mo re immediate, it would make it not so long 
time ago and what relevance does it have 
to us and I think those histories are 
important for that reason.  Not just for to
 counteract the revisi
onists, but to allow 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 50 
 
 
another generation to make this
 not be ancient history, but
 to pull it up into something 
that happened to another person, who looks just like them, 
it's real, it happened to that 
person that I'm looking at.  In the case of 
my nieces, it will be mo
re immediate than 
that and they are women now and married a
nd they're going to have families of their 
own very shortly and those ch
ildren will grow up and hear about the events of World 
War 2 and what happened to people, the Jews
 and other in that time.  And I want 
those, I want my  brother's gr
andchildren to look at those 
visuals and see those visuals 
as something that happened really to th
em, because their father almost did not 
survive, which meant that 
those children were not going to be.  And for other 
children, who do not have direct
 contact in a linear way with 
the events of that time, I 
think seeing an actual film of a survivor w
ill cause them to have
 more connection to 
that than when we hear about
 the Revolutionary War.  So I think that it is important 
from that point of view. 
Q: I do too.  I want to move over to the other side. 

[end of side one, tape 2] 

Q: We're going to have some, just final t
houghts and then Dorian has to go to work. 
A: She does.  Well I don't know, final thoughts 
are kind of hard.  I, I, I have a couple 
of them, I guess.  I notice that both Fre
ddy and I are doers, we're very practical 
people.  I think that that is a direct result 
of our early lives.  We, we are, we tend, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 51 
 
 
are survivors in mo re ways
 than one.  I am not a complainer.  I tend to take 
command, I tend to grab ahold of my  life a
nd make things happen.
  It turned out I 
couldn't get a job when I, I was always
 saying, you know, nobody wanted me and all 
that and eventually I lear
ned how to do some shorthand and ____ around in a couple 
of jobs for a couple of years and it became a
pparent to me that I couldn't really work 
for others, I had to work fo
r my self and I opened up a store.  I have been a retailer 
now, on some scale or other, since 1965 and ha
ve a pretty large store right now, takes 
up about a half a block and 
I have 13 employees.  And I find I become mo re bossy 
and mo re take charge as I go 
along.  I, but I'm very, I am a
nd have been very practical 
and I tend to, not kind of sit back and let 
life happen.  I notice Freddy is the same 
way.  We are mo re controlling and definitely
 tend to manipulate our lives, rather than 
to be manipulated by it and I think that's 
very good.  In a way, we are both stronger 
people, I think, than many of the people that
 I meet.  Most certainly there are scars, 

now I did not marry.  I did have a relations
hip for 30 years with a man whom I could 
not marry.  Consequently I don't have childre
n.  He was an older man, almo st twice 
my  age when we met and I knew that I shoul
d not be in that relationship, but I was 

unable to help my self, I, I, I had a nervous 
breakdown a couple of times when I tried, 
especially in the early years to
 stop that.  I lay that off di
rectly on my early years.  I 
needed to be loved and admired by an olde
r man and I needed that support and that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 52 
 
 
ego lift.  And I, I think, that is, is a direct 
result of the loss of my 
parents.  My father 
when I was six and my mother later, I think I 
needed that.  I needed
 to be the special 
person in somebody's life again.  And that, of
 course, affected my  personal life, even 
in the fact that, the fact that I'm a re
tailer, cause you know, I mean, then if you don't 
have a normal marriage and children, then you 
do other things and so what I did is I 
really filled up my life and all the little nooks
 and crannies so now I don't have any 
time to my self at all.  And Freddy, who 
does have a family and a lovely wife and 
wonderful children, well that still, he is a ve
ry closed up person. 
 He was not invited 
to make that original tape 
at the Holocaust Museum, he came with me that day.  His 
memory of the early years is
 much more sketchy thanmine and sometimes when I 
talk, he will remember somethi
ng, it's much more sketchy. 
 He now gives talks, as a 
survivor, to schools in his area quite frequen
tly.  He started doing that since my  tape 
was made.  But he is a mu ch mo re closed 
person, he is emotionally, I hope he never 
hears this tape... 

Q: I don't think he would. 

A: He, he is mu ch mo re closed person than
 I am, he, I said, like he never gives out 

comp liments or anything.  He, he'll never 
say that he loves somebody or he, that he, 
he's not a person who hugs and 
he's mu ch mo re emotionally closed up.  Partly he's a 
man ,  I'm a wo man ,  it's, I'm, I'm, I'm mo re 
open than he is, but the fact that he is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 53 
 
 
closed up like that, that he's not able to expr
ess his feelings.  Like I said, he did it for 
me on my 60th birthday, the window opened 
and I was amazed and then it closed up 
again, see, so, but he's much more closed 
up and I, I, I think that's a direct result of 
our early lives, absolutely.  What happens to
 you as a child always
 affects, for every 
one of us and why should it not be so fo
r us?  In a way it has made me stronger, 
certainly more self-reliant.  
When my mother died, in 
my heart I took responsibility 
for my  younger brother and maybe
 he did that in his heart for me too, I don't know, 
but I did that, I took, I 
became a grownup and I took responsibility for maintaining 
my  life and my  beliefs in a way that my  mo
ther would have wanted to and I, I, I took 
on grownup responsibilities, ind
eed I had done that even during the war.  When my 
mo ther got Typhus and sick and I took her 
out of that train from which we were 
rescued and carried her to the house a
nd you know, we were ca
lled upon as children 
to be mo re grown up than children traditionally have been and I've maintained that in 

the grown up years in a way that
 has made it mo re possible for me, let's say, to be an 
employer than an employee.  I, I have not
 been in the dependent stage, willingly 
and... 

Q: And that might include marriage as well? 

A: No, I will say that I always intended to
 marry when I was 18 and have children by 
the time I was 20, that was my  plan for my  
life and everything about me, mean to this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 54 
 
 
day I'm a good cook and I'm a nester.  I have 
had to reconfigure my
self into not being 
that, I've had to squeeze and pull and push 
myself into begin a career person, I was 
not made to be that.  I really
 should have been left to be
 where I was born, a Viennese 
person, with mu sic and danc
ing and husband and children, 
it's really what I started 
out to be and the rest of me, what I am now
, I fashioned, I forced, I, it was not what I 
was meant to be.  I love opera, I subscr
ibe, both to the city opera and to the 
metropolitan, go a lot, I try to go to the th
eater.  I have still friends from my early 
years here in this country 
and my, from my school friends, I still maintain them and 
in general, I'm pretty content with my lif
e.  I have a nice apartment.  And the man 
with whom I had my  long 
relationship has died and,
 but, I know, I suppose mo st 
people have gaps in their liv
es, certainly my  great regret is not having children, but 
given that as a given, then for the rest of
 it, I don't have too ma
ny comp laints, I have 
had cancer 14 years ago, I survived breast 
cancer.  I had a year of chemotherapy, it 
had spread, I'm very fortunate to have su
rvived another, anothe
r thing besides my  
early childhood events.  I consider these years 
that I've had since the cancer a gift.  If 
I were to die tomorrow, I would feel no a
nger, because I think my time was, if it was 
not up when I was a child, in
 those conditions, it was up when I had cancer in the end 
of my  40's.  I am 61, I think the years 
since my  cancer are an additional boon, bonus 
and, and I really enjoy mo st of my  life. 
 And as long as those whom I care and love, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001
 55 
 
 
care about and love, are well,
 you know and as long as I am able to support my self 
and if I don't become destitute or depende
nt, in mentally or physically, I will go on 
being grateful to God for 
my  continued existence.  
At th e mo men t, my  Un cle 
Benjamin died in 1957 of a heart attack, 
1957 of a heart attack, yeah.  He was 56 
years old when he died.  And we, by that 
time of course we were working and my , 
his wife, my Lillian, Leah, my aunt Leah, sh
e is today 85 years old, she still lives in 
Kew Gardens, I spend the w
eekends with her, usually, in the house in Kew Gardens 

and I'm here in my  apartm
ent mo stly, during the week and she's okay, she's doing 
well mentally and physically, mo stly.  And 
her daughters, Diana, who is a painter, 
has a studio and lives in Soho, here in 
New York and the ot
her daughter, who was 
two when I came to this country, Vivian, ha
s great interest in Tibetan Buddhism and 
has spent a lot of time, both in Nepal in the east and in France 
and is very mu ch 
involved with that and Freddy and Rachel 
and the girls are fine
 and getting married 
and the baby's expected this year and so, at
 the mo ment, I, I really count my  blessings 
and I will continue to do that, every day th
at is given to us without major problem. 

Q: Thank you so mu ch. 

A: I thank you very mu ch too.
