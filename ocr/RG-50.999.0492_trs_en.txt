W ith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our

[Applause]
 
Jill, thank you som uch for joining usandf or your willin gness today to be our 
F i rs t  
Person
.  W e ha ve  
an hour,and you havea lot to tell us, so I think we m ight as well get started imm ediately.  
 
 
Jill, you told me that Kristallnacht, or the Night of  BrokenGlass, wasthe catalystf or the 
decisionsand directions that your fam ily's lif etookfor the balance of the Holocaust and thewar.  You 
were very young at that tim e, just 5 years of age.  Before we turn to the events of the war and the 
Holocaust, tell us a little about your fam ily and your comm unity in the years leading up to the 
Ho lo c
aust.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Actually, thef irst story thatI used to hear in the house of  what was happening in 

Europe,m y m other told me aboutm y sister was born in, Ibelieve,1929
 
--
 
1930. And thewar broke 
out in 1939.  My f atherhad a cattlebusiness,andthe cattle was brought inf rom  EastPrussia, and 

housed in stables thatwere part of  theenclosed backyard of  thehouse we lived in.  
 
 
He hiredpeople who needed work, who were  ver y lo w
-
le vel intelligent but coulddo the work 
thatneeded to be done to keep the stalls clean and keep the yard clean.  He was out there, andone 

of  his workers came and said to him, If I were you, Joe, you know what I would do?  I would take this 
wheelbarrow, he points to a wheelbarrow, And I would putm y wif e and new baby in 
th at 
wheelbarrow, and I would start walking, and Iwouldn't stop until I was outof  Germany.  
 
 
My f ather said,W hy are you saying this tom e?

He said,I was invited last night to com e toone of thosem eetings that they hold,and when I 
heard what they 
have in m ind to do with you people, you better leave.  Youbetter not stay here.  
1930.  
 
 
He goes into the house and tells m y m other this interchange,and she says, You know, Joe, 
there'sone thing you can rely on:Little children andfoolstell the truth. They don't know how to lie.  
W hat thism an is telling you, take it to heart. 
 
 
T hat was the beginning.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the beginning.  
 
>> J ill P a u ly:   Ye s .   
 

>> Bill Benson:  Jill, tell us, yourf am ily itself ,you just recently, I think, learned that you can trace your 
fam ily living there in that area in Germany back centuries.  How farback does yourfam ily go?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T hef irst relative, ancestor that I canf ind in several genealogies is 1699, aroundthe 

sam e area we lived in.

>> B ill B e n s
on:  Youmentioned yourfather was in the cattlebusiness.  Inthe years af terthe Nazis 
cam e topower in 1933, right bef ore your birth, leading up to the events of Kristallnacht in1938, what 
happened to yourf ather's business during that time? 
 
>> J ill 
Pauly:  Interesting you ask me, because som ebody sent mesom e papersf rom ourhometown 

thathefound in the archives, andamongst them  was a copy of  two letters, short little, they m ight 
have even beenpostcards, but they were copies of anoticef rom the governm ent to m yf ather, 1st of 
January 1937,that hehadto stopthe business, it could no longerfunction.  Below it is anotherone of  
these statements, January 1, 1938, letting him  know that everything that they own in thebusiness 
now belongs tothe sta
te .  
 
 
As af ree Am erican, it really rocked m y boat. I mean, think about it.  Maybe som e of you have 
been living here alsofor 400 years or longer, and your ancestors had land or houses or whatever, 
and it now belongs to you or it will som eday belong to you, and youget a note in them ail,Dear sir, 
whatever you own wi ll now belong tothe state.  Pretty roughf eeling.  Pretty unreal. But ithappened. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkeven upto that point, you saw where, because of boycottsand things like that,
 
thatthe revenue really dropped
 
--
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Oh, yeah, I saw that also, inabook. W herethe incom eof  thebusiness,f rom  one year 

to the next, dropped 50%, because Ihave totell you there were som e very righteous gentiles in our 
comm unity, and I
 
recently f ound out it was a Catholic comm unity.  Iwouldn't have known that. T hey 
helped thefam ily underground. T hey hadanunderground going, which was very dangerous, 

because their punishment would have been the sam e as the Jews.

T hey tried tohel
p the fam ily's business by taking their cattle to m arket f or them  and providing 
th em  with
 
--
 
but thatdidn't work, of course,because if  they hadto close down in 1938, that was the 
end.  
 
 
T henexactly at what tim e they decidedto try
 
--
 
well, they tried to get out of  the country, but 
they started too late.  By the time they got anumberon which to get intothe United States, when 
Kristallnachthappened, they imm ediately realized that was not going to happen, they wouldn't get out 
to the United States.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  By the tim e their quota num ber came up, too late?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Ri ght, impossible.  Som etime bef oreKristallnacht, Idon't know when, I recently f ound 
out, Kenya was on the table.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we com e to that, letme ask youa coupleother questions.  Bef ore 
Kristallnachtand those years bef ore that, youwere still too young to go to school,but yoursister, 
Inge, was in school. Tell us a little about herexperience,as best you know.  
 
>> Jill Pauly: W ell, you know, under the Hitler tim e,all the teachershadto be mem bers of the Nazi 

party, andeducation was absolute.  Youhad to go to school.  Like all other Jewish children in 
Germ any, the Jewish inf rastructure wasn't such that they had Jewis h schools in every sm all town or 
even big city, so a lot of the children had to go to schooland were torm ented, bothby the teachers 
andtheir classm ates.  
 
 
Inge was ver y little.  I think she was 6
 
1/2. She had just started school, and somebody called 
her names, probably " Bloody Jew"  or whatever, and she gave theboy a bloody nose. And that was 
dangerous, very dangerous.
 
Som y parentshad to take her out.  
 
W hat be c am e  cu s t om , th e

Jewish children were sent to relatives inbordering areas, where they could go to Jewish schools,but
 
it had tobeaway f rom home. So she was wit h m y grandmother in another town, but it was a Jewish 
teacher who had a schoolhousefor all the grades inone room .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  LikeK through12?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  He was phenomenal.  She gota terrif ic education. Then that group of relatives had to 
leave for Holland in 1937 because they couldn't makea living anym ore.  And Inge hadto com e back 
to the town where we li ved, butby then she was oldenough to comm ute to Cologneby train.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  By herself?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  She was alwa ys very ind ependent. Then, when we ran away, she couldn't go
 
--
 
oh, she went to school on Kristallnacht.  You know, Kristallnacht wasnotpublicized.  It justhappened.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onem ore questionbeforewe get to that.  Youtold me that keeping kosher was, of  
course, strictly forbidden,banned by the Nazis, but yourfam ily continued to do so at considerable 
risk.  T ellus how they did that.  
 
>> Jill Pauly: W ell, when people go up to see them ain exhibit you will see som ething that 
--
 
rolls that 
has all the laws, the Nuremberg Laws against the Jews, and kosher killing was one of them . Being in 
the cattlebusiness, three of the uncles werekosher slaughterers, certif ied slaughterers. Shedecided 
th
ey weren't going to obey the law.  Maybe they wouldn't sell them eat, but for ourselves we were 
going to keep kosher.  T erribly dangerous.  One of the uncles had,would you call it anabattoir, where 

the kosher killing was done of the big cattle. I went backthere two years ago tof ind it, thearea.  
 
 
He decidedhe was going to kill a big anim al,andthe neighbors next door were really Nazis  
and watched them  very closely.  So he decided to go inside the room .  He did the kosherkilling with

the prescribed
 
knif e, then he tooka gun and shothim  to thehead sothatthe neighbors would think 
he was shooting the anim al.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And kept the knives hidden,as I recall. 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes, strapped inside the chim ney of our house.  He didn't live in ourhouse. W e were 
raided twice. W e were given away.  T hat was their def iance. They really had to have something to 
hit back with, in a quiet wa y.  
 
 
T here were other things they couldn't do anym ore, but they weren't quite as strong.  
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
Jill, of course, you started to tell us about Kristallnacht. Tell us about Kristallnacht 
and what it meantf or yourf am ily.  
 
>> Jill Pauly: W ell,I think what the audiencehas to understand is thatf orthe German Jews the 
Holocaust started in January 1933, when Hitler cam e topower, because by March 1933, 
Buchenwald, what's the other big one? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dachau?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Dachau andSachsenhausen were opened.T hey wer e not used primarily at thattim e 
for Jewish people,butfor enem ies of the state, whoever fell under that.T hey were known to be 
extrem ely, extrem ely cruel.  Andpeople did die there, but it wasn'tasystematic destructionlike what 
cam e later.  
 
 
T hef am ily knew about those cam ps.  Everybody knew about them. There was something that 
went on that you could actually f eel.  Asa 6
-
year
-
old, I saw a man who cam e out of Dachau.  Hehad 
been arrested and letout.  The Germansthreatened anyone that they let outof  the camps alive, that 

if  they toldanyone what was going on in the cam ps, they would come af ter them and kill them .  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

So whenever cam ps were spokenabout when I was little was in a whisper. They knew
 
--
 
they 
just had to have whatever it is, f aith or conf idencethat they wouldn't be doing anything to end up in 
one of  
those places. They were not asactive as later,but they were operational.  
 
 
W her e wa s  I ?   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Starting to tell usaboutKristallnacht. 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Kristallnacht. By thetim e Kristallnacht cam e,I was 5
 
1 /2 .  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas Novem ber 1938? 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  1938. For some reason, which I never knew, I was sitting in a living room , inourf am ily 
living room  with m y gra ndparents, which was a room  never usedduring the week. W eonly went 
thereon the sabbath.  So we had time
 
to sit there, whatever they were doing.  It was on ahigher level 
than the kitchen. 
 
 
I was sitting on a stool, and I can seem y f ather going to thef ront door, and I rem ember that he 
was wearing dark pants and a white shirt, which he didn't wear unless he went to synagogue in the 

m ornings or theaf ternoons.  
 
 
He went to thef rontdoor.  T here was a knock on thedoor.  And it was a gentile man that he 
knew who told him, You can't go tothe synagogue today.  Nor can yourf ather or your brother.  Do not 
go
 
to the synagogue.  
 
 
He said why?  He didn't know anything.  
 
 
T hem an said, I can't tell you wh y.  I don't know why, but just don't. Terrible things are going to 
happen.  Don't go there.

W ell, thatf rightened us terribly.  And he started making phone
 
calls, trying to f indout what was 
happening. It didn'ttake long, andhefoundout that the synagogues were being burned and that 
people were being arrested.T here were seven people in the house. They started scream ing.  T hey 
didn't know what to do, didn't know where to go.  
 
 
My grandm other decided we're running away, we're not staying in the house.  Get the drivers, 
get somebody, we're r unning away. W ehada car or two, but I don't know, it wasn't there,and
 
--
 
o r 
anotherfam ily m em ber was using the
 
c a r.   
 
 
T here were lots of phone calls. Then am ancam e and pickedus up,m y grandmother,my 
grandfather and two children. W e got in the car. T he m inute m y sister and I walked out the f ront 

door, we smelled sm oke, and it was gray, and it was m aybe 11:00, 11:30. W e gotpetrified. W e 
started scream ing.  I think we saw thef lamesof  the synagogue. It was only a block and a half away.  
W esm elled the sm oke for sure.  
 
 
Being separatedf rom our mother, we started to scream . W e were terrif ied.  Som y 
gr a n
dm other tookus into the carand made us facedown onthebedof  the car, and she putherf eet 
on us.  She was about5'2" , weighed about250 pounds, and shehad a cast on her leg. She had a 

broken leg.  She was very resolute,m y grandm other. She really ha
d  it.  
 
 
My grandfather got in the carand put hisfeetonm e. So that we couldn't get up and we 
couldn't lookout of the windows, and we couldn't seef lames, because that terrorized us. T hat way 
we were taken into Cologne.  Just bef ore we
 
--
 
just as we got into Cologne, she letus get up.  Andfor 
thef irsttim e, I saw a Nazi f lag.  Can you im agine?  For 5
 
1/2 years they keptm e under wraps in the 
house, andI had never seen a Nazif lag.

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas thef irst time you saw that?  
 
>> J ill 
Pauly:  First tim e I saw one.  I thoughtit was ver y pretty.  I lik ed the colors.  Andthey were 
hanging all over.  You know, thebuildings looked gray, andhereare these gorgeous redf lags with 
white and black on them .  Very im pressive. About 50 years later,on Clinton's inauguration evening, 
we had theater tickets in W ashington. W e'redrivin g down along the Constitutionor one ofthese 
avenues,and I see the f lags in the dark, and I lost m y breath.  I just
 
--
 
it was a f lash. It was a 
f lashback of thesef lags.  And thathappens, you know.  You have thesem em ories that com eback. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You will see som ething that evokes thatm emory?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes. W e got out of the car inCologne. W e went into an apartment building where m y 
m other'
s retired brothers and sister were living.  T hey li ved in a littletown som ewhereandsold 
ever ything, and we called them  pensioners. They were retired. T heapartment had roomf or them , 

and withinf ive m inutes it had room for 12 people. T hat's without t
he m en  of  t he f am il y.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just the women?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Just some of the wom en.  My m other,m y grandmother. T he grandparentsthat were in 
the car with us, m yf ather's parents,they wer e put ina pensionf orelderly people,and thatwas 
good 
because they hadf ood.  We, as a group, hadaf ood shortage. Itdidn't botherm e.  I don't rem ember 
being hungry e ver, butm y sister tells me thatwe had great problem s getting food on the table.  
 
 
Jews, by then, were not allowed to goto the stores
 
and shop like other people. T hey had to 
wait until 4:00 in the af ternoon. By then, they were also af raidof  going shopping. T here wasn'tm uch 
left on the shelves.

I know that m y mother, forf ood, would get onthe train and goback to Lechenich where
 
s he  
had somef riends whohelped her.  She toldm e when she wentback to this one store where theman 
was wil ling to helpher, he toldher, If you hear the door, youhave to dive underthis placeand sit 
thereuntil they leave.  In other words, he hidher

>> Bill Benson: T he shopkeeper hidher? 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  T he shopkeeper hid her.T hat's wh y she went back,because she knew the 
shopkeeper.  
 
 
T here was one wom an, she was am aidf or som e wealthy people intown, and had known the 
f a m ily lik e  f o r t he
 
300 years.  I think she was already alive then.  
 
[Laughter]
 
T hat's how long the relationship went back. Shebroughtm y unclea chicken in a basket.Have I ever 
talked about that?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't remem ber thisone, Idon'tthink.  
 
>> J ill P a
uly:  Ever y Fr i day, she broughtm y uncle a live chicken to Colognef orhimto slaughter in the 
apartm ent, so there'd befoodf or the sabbath.  Do you know what a risk she took?  Do you know how 
she kept the chicken quiet? 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us.  
 
>> J

[Laughter]
 
T hat's how chickens sleep.  And she puta blanket over it.  It nevercackled,not once. 40years later,

wanted to do.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jill, while you're at your aunt's house in Cologne, tell us where your f atherhad gone. 
 
>> J ill P a
uly:  Oh, onKristallnacht,the mainfocus of the onslaughtwas on the men.  Shewanted to 
arrest the men, and they did; 30,000 Jewish m en were put in concentration camps.  You have to 

realize that was a huge percentage, because half of  the Jews of Germ any
 
by then had lef t.  So it was 
m aybe 15% to 20% ofthe Jewish m en were incarcerated in concentration camps.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Essentially over a 24
-
hour period?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  In order to avoid that,the m en got inthef am ily car, there were f ive of them, and 

keptdriving f or 24hours, and thenthey went into the woods, and they came out just beforethe 
sabbath in Cologne.  
 
 
T hat weekend,m y father decided we were going to go into hiding, like Anne Frank's parents, in 
an attic.  If ound out since thenf rom  the living relative that the atticwas in the house where we were 
living. W e went up therefor oneor two nights, and Ingehad scream ing nightmares.  So that didn't 
work.  T hank God itdidn't work.  
 
 
A day later,onSunday, after the sabbath, three of thef ive mendecidedthey're getting outof  
Germ any even if theyhave to walk.  But they drove. W e only li ved onehour by carf rom  Fenlow, in 
Holland. Sothey drove back and got gasoline ata station in Lechenich where they knew the

W hen Ithought about it, that little girl was 10years old.  She couldhave given him away, and 
she didn't.

running the prison, Idon't know if any of  you know the history of  Hollandduring the war, there were 
quite a lot of  Dutch Nazis, and he was oneof them .  He was all set to send them back to Germ any.

she was determ ined to get out of Germany. Absolutely determ inedto leave.  And Kenya had been 

spoken about, East Af rica.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Am erica you
 
couldn't get intobecause the quota was not going to com eup. 
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Couldn't get in anywhere.  Oh, there was a scam  going on, I thinkduring that tim e, after 
Kristallnacht, where people thought they could get into Uruguay and you had topay a lot of m oney to 
get tickets or whatever, and they were ver y caref ul they didn't give the guy their money because it 
was a scam . So people were desperately tryi ng to get out.

hear Hitler on a street corner in Munich during his university days.  He decidedhehad toget outof  
Ge rm an y ASAP.  
 
 
He went to Birm ingham , England, and his sideline was helping Jewish people get out.  She 
forgot totell him  thatmy grandmother got them oney out,thef am ily m oney was sm uggled outof

It tookm oney in Holland to save them ,not tobe sentback. That took m oney. T he moneywas

>> Bill Benson:  As you f ound in these letters?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes.  T hey needed to get out,and could he please help them get into Kenya.  His 
brotherhad beenbrought outby him  early, studied law in England.Kenya was a British protectorate, 
andhe got a job with a prestigious law f irm inNairobi, Kenya.  So he had the contact in Kenya.  And 
that's whenthef un began.  
 
 
W ehad 12 people in Germ any. W ehad seven people in Holland. And she had a wholef am ily 
she wanted to help.  And naturally, m yf am ily felt if  this man is goingto help us, then she has the right 
to help herf am ily, and it gets tobeunbelievable mess,because com municating thethreem en in the 
detention cam p weren't allowed todoanything.  T hey were out of  it. I had two uncles in Holland who 
were the interlopers between the ones, andthey had to get perm ission thattheirm oney could be 
usedfor whatever heneeded to use itfor.  
 
 
W hen you read the letters, and I just read them  recently, m y lif e wasn't hanging on a string, it 
was hanging on a cobweb.  Because,the British loosened up a little bit to let Jews in af ter 
Kristallnacht, but their rules and regulations did not change. They wanted to let in white people who 
had farm ing background.  T hey had a m otive.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Into Kenya, not Britain, Kenya?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Into Kenya.  T hey hadam otive. T hey wanted the whitef armers to settle thehighlands 
to keep it within the British interests. And they wanted to know if  the family m em bers were farm ers. 
T he guy wrote yes, we  were cattle dealers an
d f arm ers.  But they were so strict about their criteria 
thatthef am ily was af raid they wouldn't let us in, because they really weren't hoeingf ields, they were

the listof  names. There were a lotof  names. Unf ortunately,
 
1/3 of them were over 70, and they were

T hat would be September 1939.  So Britain was not at war with Germ any atthe time. So you could 
tra ve l.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Ri ght.  But when we traveled, we had to travel according to the Nazi perm ission,and 
that was very dangerous in Germ any, for som e reason very dangerous in Germany.  Notso

didn't particularly both

>> Bill Benson:  It wasa Germ an ship?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  It was a Nazi ship, andthey certainly botheredm y m other.  W e were notf ree. W e were 
under very str ict supervision.  Also, on the trainf rom Cologne to Genoa
 
was thefear of them throwing 
som e of the passengers off thetrain. That could have m eantbeingseparatedf rom m y mother.  
 
 
So bef ore we left Cologne, she gave m ea lecture, andI think that's thepoint where I lostm y

W egotonthe train. I rem ember saying goodbye.  That was horrendous,m y mother's 
separationf rom  someof thesepeople. Idon't remember it. My sist er said there were 60 relatives at

that was like sitting theref or six weeks.  I didn't know what threehours was.

Iknow I'm f astf orwarding a little bit
 
here. As you said, 
you're underthe supervision, it's a Nazi ship,and yourm other hada ver y scary m om ent whenthe 

off icer, the captain, heard you singing.  Tell us about that.  
 
>> Jill Pauly: W henIwas f ree,I sang.  I was always sin ging.  I love  m usic. On the shipIwas f ree, so 

I sang. ButI didn't know that I was singing to a point where I couldbe overheard.  I was singing to 
m yself . I was overheard.  
 
 
T he captain of the ship asked m y mother, she was terrif ied when she was called tothe capta
in ,  
andasked her if I could singf or the crew. W ell, she couldn't say no.  She hada problem . It had just 
been Passover in April, and the relatives we lived with, one of the uncles was an opera singer with a 
m agnif icent voice , and the other one,his brother, also had a magnificent voice. I loved to sing with 
them . They taughtm e to sing the whole Passover Haggadah.  It keptm e busy.  It keptm e going.  
And whenI got on theship that was stillf resh in m y m ind,and I gave hera hard tim e with the Red 
Sea. I wanted to seewhen we got into the Red Sea. I wanted to see that. The Red Sea isn't red.

I insisted on staying up to see that.  She let me.  I was very disappointed I didn't see the Red Sea. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Herf ear is you're going to sing these songs that you had sungf or Passover before 
the Nazis.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Because I had no differentiation.  My grandm other taught meall these German 

folksongs when I was little.  Here I knew.  Haggadah, which was lovely.  She didn't wantm
e t o  s i n g 
th a t in f ro nt of the  cre w.  
 
 
I remember the two aunts and two grandm others in the cabin with me teaching me overnight to 
separate the two, andI understood enough that Ionly sang the Germ anf olksongs.  Im ust have done 

well, because theperson was still living, she's 96, she said, You didn't do it once; youdid it every 
single night for the two weeks we were on the ship. I don't rem ember that.  
 
 
I do remember there was a spy on the ship who tried to get inf orm ation out of m y sister and I.  
He  
f ollowed usaround, and the wom en were af raid of him . So they posted themselves allover the 
ship to watch us whenwe were with this man.  He cam eevery day t o take us for a walk.  He asked us 

questions,and we said we didn't know, because we didn't. Luckily, we didn't know.

you haven't seen" Nowhere inAf rica,"  it's onNetf lix, and that's the story ofm y childhood in Kenya.  
It's not exactly the same, but it's very sim ilar.  T he difference ism y family were observant Jews, we

af ter you got there, did your f am ily have any real idea 
what was taking placein Germany, and was there any ability to comm unicate with any f am ily

of  he r  
relatives, and when they sat and read this letter they realized that between the lines she was telling 
them  thatthey were not living in their homes,andthat they were hungr y.  And, interestingly enough, 
m y sister, who translates for them useum , got letters,a packetf rom Cologne totranslate two years

in America, who had gotten out early.

W ith the knowledge that we had, and with what we read in the letters, we realized that they 
were very hungr y.  Af ter the war broke out, in 1939,by 1940they rem oved the Jewish peoplef rom  
their homes and put them  in Jew houses, they created ghettos. Sowe were able to gleana lotof

My husband, who is sitting here, who is related tothe Anne Frankf am ily, found out that

I tried to get into a cemetery where the ancestors are buried,and I couldn't get in. And Itried 
to get into thehom e that's still standing where we lived, and the wom an wouldn't let us in. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  She wouldn't let you come into the home?  
 
>> J ill P a u ly
:  No, shewouldn't let us in. Other than that,the people are very gracious and very nice.  
But I sim ply don't have any interestto goback.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Another place you lived,of  course, in Kenya, and Ithink you've recently reconnected 

with  th e
 
Jewish community in Nairobi.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  Yes, I did f or a while.  I don't know if  they're still li ving, but I was connectedfor a little 

wh ile .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  But most of thepeople that we were in f riendship with or connec
t ion  wit h  a ls o lef t  
Kenya.  Sooner or later.  Most of them went to Israel. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jill, I think we're close to closing our program ,andI'm going to turnback to Jill in just 

a moment.  I wantf irst to thankall of  youfor being herefor our 
Fi

hasthe last word.  So I'm going to turn 
back to Jill to close the program  in just a moment. Butf irst, two things.  One, because we didn't have 
a chancefor you to ask Jill questions, when she's done, she'll stepoff the stage.  If anybody wants to

com e askher a question, or just say hi, shake herhand, give her ahug,f eel f reetodo that.  Jill will 
be here.  
 
 
W hen Jill isf inished, I'm  going toask you all to stan
d, because our photographer, Joel, is going 
to com eupon stage and takea photographof  Jill with you as thebackdrop. T hatm akesfor a very 
nice picture. W e'll do that. 
 
 
On thatnote, Jill?  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  M y last word?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your last
 
word.  
 
>> Jill Pauly:  You know, what I spoke about today is really the very beginning, like apregnancy in its 

f irst six week, or a disaster. W hen you go through thism useum , the horrors and theawf ulconditions 
of  peoplef or thenext f ive or six years
 
were horrendous. All you have todo is just think about one 
person who is in a concentration cam p, who is alive, who f ollows the regime, whatever thatregim e 

was, and what they m ust have been thinkingand what wouldhappen tothem  in any given m om ent, 
at
 
any gi ven tim e. 
 
 
I'm  not speaking of  one that went to the gaschambers. I'm speaking of  one who survive d, who 
cam e out at the otherend.  And then when you do that, when you bring it down to a singleperson, 
you get so muchbetter a f eeling of  what it was really all about. W hen you go through your lif e on a 
daily basis and you plan, "I'm  going to the beauty parlor, I'm going tothemarket and I'm  going to call 
m y son, now I'm  going to senda gif t to someone." W hat didthese poor people have to think a
b ou t, 
and why?  Sim ply becauseof theirf aith? Itm akes you think thatm ankind ism ad. They certainly 
were m ad at thattim e.

T hat's why I work here, to m em orialize thosepeople,m any, m any hundreds of whom  were m y 
fam ily.  They can't speak.  T hey've never been able to speak or contact a soul.W e're the only ones 
left that can speak on their behalf . So, like we com ehereand do this work, which is noteasy, 

because you never adapt,for you to com ehere and visit, this is justthebeginning of  learning
.  It's a 
huge history.  It'san im portant history to theAm erican People.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be here.  
 
 
W ith that, I close.  
 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I can get you all to stand,please.
