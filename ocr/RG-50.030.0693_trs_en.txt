Holocaust, and the toll 
it took on your own 
family. I™d like to start the

duced  to the world th at you 
were born into. So , if you could tell me 
when you were born, the date; where you

your family too, but we
 start with this, okay?

years old, I joined the British army, 
and they  advised you to change 
your name, so I changed it to 
Norman Albert 
Miller
, s-so I™d have my 
nor
 and 
bert
 within the name. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Because you™re in the war, they di
dn™t naturalize people, and when you go 
overseas in the Œ in the army and y-yo
u should get captured, ye Œ th e name 
Müeller
 
would stand out, and you know, they advise
 you to change it, it was just right Œ

A: Yes, right. So, when I was about five

moved to  
Nuremberg
. My father accepted a job w
ith the main congregation in 
Nuremberg
, they had a Œ a huge, beautiful syna
gogue. And his job was Œ was, so I 
said, as a teacher, he was teaching Jewish 
subjects to Jewish pe
ople in the public 
schools. He Œ 

Q: Oh, so he was a Œ he was then in Œ in 
Germany
, I believe teachers are civil 
servants. Were they civil se
rvants in those days too? 
A: I™m not sure if he was. 
They Œ he Œ being Œ being empl
oyed at that time, at Œ  by 
this congregation, it was a big congreg ation, probably  quite wealthy. 
Q: Do you remember how 
many people about to Œ 
A: No, that I wouldn™t know. 

Q: Okay .

job, just like if you were employed by the

Nuremberg
, we visited the grandparents 
quite often, you know, in 
Tann
, you know 
[indeciphera ble]
  
Q: Was the distance great? 
A: Not only. I would say both place
s you would consider as southern 
Germany
.

Hessen
 Œ as the northern part of 
Germany
, and Œ 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q: No, no.

Frankfurt

town though. Do you

w, do you remem Œ wh

brother, and you know, the brother was in 
the business also. And being a rural area, 
they Œ I remember th ey also
 collected the ski Œ ca Œ  
Q: Cowhides. 
A: Cowh ides. They don Œ I don™t believe they
 turned it into leat
her, but you know, as 
maybe somebody else did that. But I reme
mb er where they stored them, you know, 
they salted them or something like that. 

Q: That was your mother™s side of the family ? 
A: That Œ mother™s side of the family. I 
also had a gra Œ a great-grandmother living 
there.

Q: Wow. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You remember her? 
A: Yes, I do, and I have pictures of he
r, and th e Œ you know, of the whole fami ly. 
Q: So sh e Œ 

A: My father was a fo Œ you
 know, liked photography in
 the very early years. I 
reme mb er he had a si Œ a square, or rectan
gular type of camera, 
and had to put in a 
glass cassette, so Œ and he develo ped hi
s own pictures. So, we have quite a few 

pictures of the family at Œ of that time.

done, you know. Return ing to 
Tann Œ [technical 
directions] 
In Œ yes, earliest memories; how la
rge was the town? Do you remember? 
I mean, were there many Jewi
sh people, were there Œ 
A: There were Œ there were quite a few 
Jewish, I Œ I Œ I don™t know any numbers, 
but like I mentioned before that the one Œ th
e ancestor, th-the sons of the ancestors, 
they changed their names. 
Q: Yes. 
A: And there were people called 
Ravenstein
(ph) and 
Heilbraun
(ph), and these were 
the names they Œ these sons had ex Œ you 
know, accepted  early Œ in earlier years. 
Q: So there Œ in some ways 
you were all interrelated.  
A: Right, right, you know, the same fa-family
. And th Œ there Œ as a matter of fact 
there were a couple of families that
 later had rabbis Œ there was a Rabbi 
Heilbraun
(ph) and a Rabbi 
Froidenthal
(ph). 
Heilbraun
(ph) was here in the united 
Œ he came to 
United States
. I don™t think 
Froidenthal

Nuremberg
, I™m not sure.

Interview with NormanMiller  
 
April 15, 2013

 of plates, and for Passover, another tw o 
sets that, you know, the Œ according to
 th e law, and whatever, you know. 
Q: Do you Œ and let™s talk a 
little bit about your father™s si

teacher. 
A: Right. 

Q: What about his parents, sib
lings, grandparents and so on? 
A: He was born in 
Moritzfeld
, which is in 
Thüringen
, you know, eastern 
Germany
. He went Œ well he Œ he
 had Œ he had al-also 
a number of siblings. I 
reme mb er him often visited one in Œ in 
Thüring en
 on vacation time. He Œ he Œ his 
education was on th e religious side. He went 
to seminary. And then Œ this is Œ this Œ 
ah Œ I don™t reme mb er, and it™s a kind of my
stery to me; I have a number of papers 
of Œ from Œ from his educati Œ about his e-
education. And I was 
born in ™24. They 
got married in 1922. And it seems that he went to 
Frankfurt 
in ™27 and ™28 to  study

found out to Œ he has a Œ papers from Œ 
Q: Certificates and diplomas and things, yeah . 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 certificates upon Œ in

Q: Tell me a little bit about what kind of pe
ople your parents were. What were their 
personalities like, your mother and your father? 
A: Well, my Œ my  Œ my  father was a strong 
person. Strict Œ mo re with me than my  
sister, I Œ I felt at that time. But you know,
 if you do Œ if you came home with a good 
report cards, or Œ you k
now, you could get anything from him, sort of. 

[indecipherable]
 you know, why Œ my  mo ther
 was a very warm person. 
Q: Who were you closer to? 
A: It™s hard to say, you kn
ow. Probably my moth
er, somewhat. What else is there to 
say about them? 
Q: Well, are there any Œ any Œ any memori
es you have of Œ of spending time with 
them? I Œ I™m Œ I™m trying to get a sense 
of what your ch ildhood 
was like before you 
moved to  
Nuremberg
. What kind of home life was there, what kind of Œ wh at 
memo ries you have of those things. 
A: Well, it Œ it Œ I consider

close-knit community.

Q: Well, as you™re so close in age, did

A: No, no, good relations
hip, good relationship. 
Q: Okay. Let™s go to Œ let™s go to 
Nuremberg
, you know, and what are your earliest 
memo ries  o f  
Nuremberg
? 
A: Well, I Œ I started school there. Well, I 
was Œ I mu st have been six, maybe I Œ I™m 
Œ I don™t ha Œ have exact me mo ries or Œ ma
ybe I went to school or s Œ school in 
Tann
 over there, or started in 
Tann
. Then in 
Nuremberg
 I went to school that was 
associated with an Orthodox 
synagogue. I b Œ and then  later on Œ all right, I se Œ I 
think the Œ the arrangements, or the Œ 
the setup fo r schooling in Œ in  Œ in 
Nuremberg
 
was you go four years in el-eleme ntary, and 
then five years in high school. Or it used 
to Œ I think it used to 
be six years, but under 
Hitler
 they cut it short to five years. 
And I Œ I Œ I believe later on Jewish childre
n couldn™t stay Œ go to  public school as 
I™m Œ anymore, so that I Œ a Jewish larg
er school was formed, and my  ti Œ and my  
father was teaching there. So, if I remember
 colle Œ correctly, I probably stayed in 

the Orthodox school for about four years. A
nd I remember I was in my father™s class 
for one year. 

Q: Oh my. What was that like? 

A: So Œ pard on? 

 
Interview with NormanMiller

15
Q: What was that like, ha
ving your father be Œ 
A: He was very strict with me. But he wa
s a very good teacher, 
and so I think after 
the fifth year, I went to high school for four years in Œ in 
Fürth
. Yeah, there was a 
real Œ a Œ a Jewish high school in 
Fürth
. 
Q: What did he teach? Remind me agai
n, what was it Œ what subjects Œ 
A: The whole curriculum for a fifth g-grade. 
Q: Oh, so everything from math, 
to history, to science, to Œ 
A: Ri-Ri-Right, right. 

Q: I see. O k ay. 

A: In the Œ when I was in 
the Orthodox school, I al so
 was in the choir in the 
synagogue; we had a boys 
and men choir. I still rememb
er s-someth ing o-o Œ you 
know, I still reme Œ I still wish Œ see it, you Œ  

Q: Did you enjoy th at, being in the choir? 

A: Yeah, I liked to sing. I enjoyed it, I en
joyed it. And then later on in the schooling 
in Œ in 
Fürth
, in the high school, we used
 to take a streetcar from 
N u remberg
 to 
Fürth
 ev ery day. 
Q: And how long would that take? 
A: Oh, I don™t Œ maybe a half an hour, o-or y Œ maybe even less. 
Q: Now, wh en you were in high school, 
Hitler
 was already in power. 
A: Oh yes, right, right. 

 
Interview with NormanMiller  
 
April 15, 2013 
 

 
 
16
Q: So were there any incidents on the streetcars? 
A: No, I Œ I don™t re Œ I was thinking ab out 
that the other day, I don™t reme mb er any. 
I don™t rememb er any. 
Q: Do Œ do you remember 
Œ do you rememb er when 
Hitler 
came to power? You 
would have been eight years old, or seve
n years old. Do you rememb er whether it 
was talked about at home? 
A: I don™t remember w h at ta Œ we talked
 about at home. I reme mb er, you know, the 
Œ my parents, they were really aware of Œ you
 know, they Œ they ke
pt up to date with 
the newspapers and I rememb er 
Hindenburg
 and 
Hitler
 taking over, but n-no 
details, you know Œ 

Q: No in cidents stick out in your mind? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yo
u see, su Œ in Œ in some way my  Œ my  father was not 
too much involved 
in it, by being employed by th e 
Œ a main synagogue. Wh ile 
others, who had businesses in other Œ b
oycotts, and smashed windows, and that k-
kind of stuff. So Œ 
Q: When  was the first time that you felt pe
rhap s a bit of danger, a bit of insecurity 

out in public? Or did you? 
A: I didn™t Œ I Œ I Œ I really didn™t. You know, 
Nuremberg
 was the Œ the big 
[indecipherable]
 you know, every year they  had a huge Œ 
Q: Rally. 

 
Interview with NormanMiller  
 
April 15, 2013 
 

 
 
17
A: Œ a Œ a rallies, and even there, we-we 
even went to watch them marching through 
the towns. 
Q: Really? 
A: I mean, the Œ we didn™
t pu Œ you know, from the 
distance, at least.  
Q: What did you Œ what is an image in your mind of what you saw? 
A: Well, hu-huge crowds, and Œ you kn
ow, marching and ch eering and I mean, I 

wasn™t Œ I wasn™t really thinking about it. 
I don™t think I really was threatened Œ felt 
threatened at that time. 

Q: Mm-hm. And what about 
Suza
(ph)? 
[technical interruption]
 Do you remember 
how she reacted to all 
these sorts of things? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No. Yeah. 

A: No. 

Q: What kind of personality did
 Suza
(ph) have? 
A: She has a Œ a very, very
 fr-friendly person. The s Œ th
e Œ she was ver-very nice 
looking, very outg Œ and you 
kn Œ ou Œ very outgoing. As a 
matter of fact, they Œ the 
Œ somebody nowad Œ and fo r Œ for many years now here in the 
States
, he collected 
names of people that came from 
Nuremberg
 and 
Fürth
, and he had the newsletter 
every year. And in th e latest one, somebody
 wrote in who was also in a Œ in the 
camp in 
Latvia

Q: Oh. Even  there. 
A: Yeah, right, right. 

Q: Even there.  
A: Right. 
Q: How did Œ okay, so you live in 
Nuremberg
, wh ere in many ways it sounds like 
you™re isolated from these m
onumental events, you know Œ 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Œ that are Œ that are taking place,
 these very unsettling developments. 
A: Right, right, right. 
Q: And be Œ your father being employed by
 the larger synagogue, in some ways has 
one, I guess, shield Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ that others did not. And y

Fürth
, and there is the 
annual Nazi Œ 
A: Party Œ

19
Q: Œ you see those, kind of from a distance. Tell me , how did life in the 30s develop 
then, for you and for your family? 

A: In Œ well, the Œ th-the really 
big restrictio ns came after I left 
Germany
, you 
know, I Œ a-at the Œ close to the war Œ you 
know, at Œ when  Œ wh
en the war started, 
we Œ you know, my Œ my pare
nts, they liked the outdoors.
 We had bicycles, we went 
on bicycle rides. We went 
on hikes, we went to vacations in the Œ in the 
Alps
 and we 
had Œ we had a pleasant, middle class type of life. 
Q: Even here, in 
Nuremberg
, was there any interaction with non-Jews? 
A: I was thinking about that the other day 
an d, not on my part. We had a cleaning 
woman who wasn™t Jewish. My
 Œ my father was also a 
mu sician, he loved music. 
We™ll find that out la-later. And he had a 
Œ they had musical evenings in the house, 
quartets, quintets. 

Q: Oh, nice. 

A: And I Œ one of the memb ers,
 I don™t know if they were non-Jewish or not, then he 
also was, for a part of his job in 
Nuremberg

Q: And they  were 
[indecipherable]
 
A: But in Œ in Œ in nothing Œ 
I thought Œ I thi Œ I might have had a fight with Œ with

A: I don™t know any details about that, but 
I Œ I Œ you Œ like I mentioned before, they 
were pretty worldly, you know, re
ad new-newspapers and all that. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I remember th ey used to
 listen to the Œ the radio from 
Luxembourg
, and you

inquisitive enough to Œ to find 
out what™s going on in th
e world, you know, a-apart 
from what™s fed to you within 
Germ any
. 
Q: Yeah. Well, what I™m trying to Œ what I™m
 trying to establish 
is the beginningsof 
their decision to  get you out of the countr
y. It mu st have Œ something mu st have 
happened  to  make them say, I want to get Œ 

A: Well, the Œ there was the 
Kristallnacht
 Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you know.  
Q: So tell us about that Œ 

A: Okay . 
Q: Œ how that Œ yeah . 
A: There was a lot of Œ very early in th
e mornings, a lot Œ or maybe it was still 
partially in nighttime, a lot 
of this tumult in Œ in the 
street. So we all got up, 
everybody got dressed except me, I stayed
 in my pajamas. We looked out the 
window. And this is what we heard a-
afterwards, th-that somebody came to the 
bakery and asked if there are Jews in the 
house, and they  said no. So  they went 
away. And apparently  one of 
the kids I tangled with at
 one time mentioned, on the 
second floor, Jews living. So th ey ca Œ so 
th-they came in the 
house, went onto the 
second Œ the second floor. On  each floor th
ere were two apar Œ uni Œ each landing, 

 
Interview with NormanMiller

you know, there were two ap artments. So th
e other party on out floor Œ we were the 
Müellers
, and they were the 
Meyers
(ph), not je Œ not Jewish. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So, these people went to the 
Meyers
, assuming they were the Jews. 
Q: The Jews, yeah. 
A: They made them in Œ in the Œ in th
e house, everybody in 
the ba Œ had in th e 
basement a little comp artment where you ke
ep  your coal and your wood, and you 
chop your wood. So they aske
d them to get the ga Œ an
 ax from the basement. So 
they came up, and ju st before they  went 
into their apartment, they said, are you 
Jews? And they said no, we ar
e not Jews, they are the Jews
. S-So they came into our 
apartment, and they chased 
us out. So we went one floo
r up, in th e Œ you know, the 
next floor up, so up the 
stairs. And they started sm
ashing furniture, musical 
instruments, split open the feather beds. The 
mur Œ mur Œ we had a Œ a Œ sort of a big 
cupboard where my mother had made ja
ms and you know, pickled stuff, they 
smashed that. So you can imagine the feathe
rs, and the pickles, and a real mess. But 
fortunately, they didn™t arre
st my father. Because a lotof men were arrested. As a 
matter of fact, even people my  age were 
arrested. I don™t know, it may come up later 
in the story, a fre Œ friends of ours, the s
on was arrested wi Œ and the father. But the 
son was released right Œ right away. So afte
r that we had to move into  a house where 
only Jews lived. So  we Œ

Q: What kind of a shock Œ that 
mu st have been a huge shock. 
A: Sure, it came Œ you know Œ you know Œ 

Q: Do you remember how your parents reacted? 
A: They were pre Œ no, not really, but thin
king back  that nu Œ they  were pretty ca-
calm. 
Q: Maybe for the children. 

A: Yeah, yeah. You know, I™m a Œ probably 
they realized what 
Œ you know, they Œ 
they realized the Œ I got Œ I said before
, we were not involve
d in having windows 
smashed and that sort of stuff. But this rea
lly  Œ at that time it sinks in that Œ you 
know, that you™re threatened
, you know. So we had to  m
ove into a house where only 
Jewish people lived. Yeah? 

Q: Before that happens Œ excuse me Œ were
 you able Œ able to salvage anything from 
your old apartment? 

A: Sal Œ I guess some Œ some of it, I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t remember. 
Q: And then , did you ev er Œ did the 
Meyers
(ph) ever come to speak with you? 
A: No, no, no.

A: Well, they were kind of re-reprimande
d, but they Œ I think they  had a son who 
was a Nazi judge or something, you know, 
it™s a sort of a safety for them. No, I 
mean, we Œ we knew them for ma ny years 
where Œ you know, for a num Œ a bunch 
of years. That was the only apartment we had in 
Nuremberg
, you know, prio r to 
moving to th at house wa Œ in 
Sunstrasse
(ph). And there we had 
[indecipherable]
 
apartment with a Œ a very 
Orthodox, elderly couple. 
Q: Okay . Ho w Œ wh at was it like, that apartment? Explain first your Œ your first one, 
how large was it, how many rooms,
 and then the second one. 
A: There again, one, t Œ there was my pa
rents™ bedroom, then there was another 
bedroom, and th ere was a, like a living room
 and it was a fairly larg e apartment, you 
know. 
Q: The first one. 

A: The first one. Th-The second one I don™t remember too much either. You know, 

we had comb ined kitchen and 
pa-parents™ bedroom, I think.
 My grand Œ or later my  
grandmother joined us.  

Q: Your mother™s mother? 

A: Yes. Well, wh-what happened, I don™t 
know, sh Œ da Œ wh ether th-they had to 
move, or they moved from 
Tann
, and they Œ well, at th
at time there was only my 
grandmother and my  Œ my  uncle; he was 
not married. So my  gran dmother moved to

another of her daughters in 
Würzburg
, who later came to the 
United States
, and 
then my  grandmother came to us. 
Q: I see. 
A: It was kind of Œ kind of
 close living, you know, chan
ging Œ you know, having the 
same apartment with a Œ with another party. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: Especially as they were 
really, strictly Orthodox.  
Q: Hang on just a second. Did your pa
rents Œ excuse me Œ did your Œ did your 
parents behavior or demeanor change after 
Kristallnacht
? Because to me, it sounds 
from your telling, that that was the mo
st significant event up until that time. 
A: Right, right, right, right, right. 

Q: Is that right? 

A: Well, we Œ we all got passports 
Œ well, that was in ™38, 1938.  
Q: Right. 
A: We all got passports, and my  parents mu st have 
regist
(ph) me and my sister for 
the Œ you know, the 
Kindertransport
. I™m not sure. We Œ the Œ the people we 
shared the apartment 
with, their name was 
Munk
, 
m-u-n-k
. And they had, like I 
said, very religious family, and they had a 
number of rabbis in the Œ as relativ es. And

Berlin

and from Œ from Œ I think 
Berlin
, and from 
Lo ndon
, that soon I wou Œ I would be 
going to 
England
. 
Q: So, can I assume th en your parents starte
d  talking to them about their feeling of Œ 
of lack of safety, and wantin
g to get you out? Was that it? 
A: Ri-Right. And you know, other acquain
tances, or relatives had moved on, you 
know. Either they had to, yo
u know, they were pushed or 
Œ or they were forced to 
evacuate Œ to em-emig rate, or voluntarily
 emig-emigrated. And, you know, th ey 
received reports from them.  

Q: Was there talk about the whole family leav ing?

[indecipherable]
 
Q: Were you Œ were Œ were 
you ready to go? That is, we
re you thinking it™s only a 
matter of months til I™m out of here? Or di
d you have no idea 
of what was going on 
behind the scenes, as far as 
the rabbis being contacted in  
Lo ndon
 and so Œ 
A: No, you know, the Œ it Œ it was planned to
, you know, to Œ to 
get the Œ get me  and 
my  sister, you know, before Œ wh ere Œ my  
fr Œ no, my  parents already registered 
with the American consulate, you know, for a quota number. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You know, there were the Œ there was a 
long line of people who wanted to  go to 
the 
States
, so we had a Œ we had a quota numb e
r, so the eventual 
goal was to go to 
the 
United States
. Now comes the interestin g part. Th
is other fe Œ the Œ the Œ the oth 
Œ the Œ th e family who son with  me learned swa Œ weld ing, th-the father was Œ at the 

Kristallnacht
, was ar rested and was in 
Dach au
. And he was supposed to Œ he was 
al Œ a Œ go-going to  be freed, if he leaves 
the country. So one day they were leaving 
Œ you know, they made arrangeme
nts, they were leaving for 
England
 to wait out 
their quo-quota numb er, to be called at a la
ter date. And my  father s Œ I don™t know

them? And I said, if you come along. I th
ink he re Œ tried to smuggle me Œ you 
know, we had those letters that Œ th-th-th
ese letters were August ™39, and the war 
started September Œ 
Q: September. 
A: Œ ‚39 

Q: That™s right. 

A: So, this was in Œ this was in Se-Septe
mber, when these fre Œ 
when these Œ the fre 
Œ the friends were moving to 
England
. On that day he asked me if I want to come, 
he s Œ he Œ I said, if he would co me. So we
 went, and there™s some things, like I said, 
I for Œ I forgot comp letely, but was aware of
 again, when I received Œ when I was re-
recently reading my let Œ the letters. So 
what happened was, 
they were going on a Œ 
on th e train to 
Würzburg
, to m Œ get an express train that goes through 
Holland
. 
And I had Œ didn™t have papers. I Œ I Œ I do
n™t know what was in his mind, I didn™t 
have papers to go to 
Holland
. In 
Holland
 we had a Œ a cousin living. Maybe he tried 
to smu-smuggle me over. I don Œ I really don™t know what was in his mind. Okay , so 

we were supposed to  take that train to 
Wü rzburg
, took an express train. And 
according to the story in the 
letters, the Œ the train was delayed, which meant that we 
didn™t get the express train. So when we go to 
Würzburg
, we got another train, it 
stopped in 
Colo gne
. Wa Œ as we were in the station, a group of 
Kindertransport 
was going to
 England
. My father asked them if I c
ould travel with them, so they

said okay, if Œ if Œ if you have pa
pers. And it so happened  that in 
Co log n e
 was an 
English consulate. We 
go Œ he and I, we went there. It
 w as closed. They told me to 
wait a block away. Somehow he got inside. 
He got a stamp in my  passport. It was 
the last day of the co Œ the consul to be th
ere. It™s the last day.
 So  he got in, got a 
stamp in my passport, with a notation,
 see letter. You know, the letter from 
Berlin
 
and Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and then I traveled
 with that group to 
England
. It Œ you know, this was like 
miracles, o n e fo Œ you know, if
 one Œ if one would have Œ if Œ if the train, the first 
train would have been  on tim
e, I would have been at the border and not go any 
further.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: So, there was this Œ 

Q: So, but it was almo st like a goodbye
 on the quick. A goodbye th at was Œ 
A: Right, and Œ 

Q: Œ sort of Œ 

A: And Œ and th  Œ and it was like a puzzle wh
ere one piece fitted into the other. If Œ 
if Œ if there wouldn™t have b
een a Œ a children transport in 
Co log n e
, I wouldn™t have 
been Œ come to 
England
. If there wouldn™t have been 
a consul, an English consul, I 
wouldn™t have got into 
England
. This Œ th-this like I Œ

Q: So one of my  questions is, what about 
Suza

A: Well, she was younger. We Œ and sh e wa

send her on in a Œ you know, in a strange 
world, and Œ and I don™t know if they  had 
any co rrespondence that 
she would be going to 
England
 or Œ

ere for a while. And then they
 sent me to a school, I 
stayed there for t-two or three week
s, and then they send me to east 
London
, to a 
rabbi whose fami ly was e-evacuated, and he 
took in four or five boys, and we lived 
with him for a while. He find jobs for us. Fi
rst, in some Œ some factory, knocking out 
pots and pans and stuff like that. And th en Œ 

Q: Did th e welding have 
anything to help you Œ 

A: Well, it Œ because of the welding, he 
found me some other j-job in a machine 
shop. And I had to do the welding, but I wa
sn™t any good. But th
ey took me anyway. 
Q: I want to back  up just a little bit, so
 I understand correctly. You were probab ly on 
one of the last 
Kindertransports
. 
A: I would say so. 
Q: Because the war had already started. If the British consul was Œ 
A: No, he was c Œ he was closed, 
he was probably  going to leave. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But it was still three days before the war. 
Q: So it was late August, late August ™39. 

A: Right, right, right.

Q: Okay, okay, so the war was imminent. 
A: Right. 

Q: Truly imminent. 
A: Right. 
Q: And when was the first time that 
you wrote to your pa
rents and you got 
something from them? Where 
were you at the time? 
A: Well Œ 
Q: Cause if you™re moving around from 
one place to another, did you have an  
address to which they could send letters to? 
A: That™s a good question. I think I mu st 
have sent Œ I Œ I think maybe as soon as I 
arrived, I probably sent them something.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And then  we Œ we co Œ we co rresponde
d, and eventually I had about 30 letters 
from Œ from them. At first they
 sent their letters to an uncle. Actu Œ we called him 
uncle, but he was my mother™s uncle, in 
Belgium
, and he then forward the letters to 
me. And after 
Belgium
 was occupied, my father sent them to 
Sweden
, some 
acquaintance, or a Œ a friend, and they forw
arded. And my  mo ther™s sister and family 
were already in the uni Œ 
United States
, so they™d send it Œ you know, 
United States
 
wasn™t in Œ a-at war with germ Œ 

Q: In the war yet. 

 
Interview with NormanMiller

38
A: Œ at Œ at that time. And then the Œ th
ey fo rwarded Œ so you know, so roundabout 
way. 
Q: What did they desc
ribe in those letters? 
A: Well, th-their Œ their life at the time. 
Like I said, they tried to prepare for the 
eventual emigration, you know, 
they tried the English, and 
e-even my mother tried to 
te Œ learn it, and she had some difficulties doing that. 

Q: So even when
 the war starts, th ere is a possibility to leave? 
A: Peop Œ yes, people left. He describes ho
w ma Œ he mentions many people that left 
at certain times, oh this family is leaving,
 now this. And they 
Œ well, they were Œ 
they Œ th ey used to go maybe to 
Spa in
 or 
Portugal
, and to get a ship, or maybe even 
in the beginning to 
Rotterdam 
to Œ to get a ship the 
States
. You know, there was no 
war between the 
United States
 and 
Germany
. Th-They carried on. My father 
helped out many friends who left without 
having Œ without be
ing able to take 
furniture or anything with th
em. But they called them lifts 
at that time, but he did a 
lot of footwo rk fo r them, you k
now, go to the off Œ get all the proper papers to have 
these things sent off. At the same time one 
of the musician friends
 was afraid for the 
Œ so he was able to have Œ well,
 in the very early time, when 
Holland
 was not 
invaded yet, he had a suitcase sent to 
Holland
 and then  fo rwarded 
to me, with some 
clothing and papers and photos. 

Q: So th at™s how you ha
ve the family photos? 

 
Interview with NormanMiller  
 
April 15, 2013 
 

 
 
39
A: Right, right, right. 
Q: I see. I see. Did th
ey think Œ oh, okay Œ 
A: Well, he Œ he hinted on the restrictions 
like, they had to be in Œ indoors by eight 
o™clock. My  mo ther had her line out fo r fish
, and Œ and they fish
ed for quite a bit. 
But they still Œ I wouldn™t say normal life
, but they still Œ he describes my sister 
going a ride on a Œ on a bike to a Œ with 
friends, and you know
, described things. 
They  were Œ they™re learning stenograp hy, and Œ 
Q: Did th ey have any Œ did they  put all th
eir hopes, do you th ink, on that quota 
number with the American embassy, or were
 they trying other ways to get out to 
other countries? 

A: They Œ they Œ ther
e is a mention, I think, in a le
tter, said they tried to go to 
South 
America
 so mewhere. And my  grandmother lived 
with us, and sh-she also only had a 
mu ch, mu ch later quota number, be Œ and my  menti Œ my  parents Œ my  father 
mentioned many times in the Œ in
 the letters that he didn™t
 know what to do, because 
he Œ he didn™t want to just leave her 
on her own, if the family would move to 
States
. 
He writes of trying to get 
my sister to go to Œ to 
Palestine
. He tried many ways to, 
you know, to speed up getting out, without 
having to wait for the Œ you know, the 
quota numb er to be called.  

Q: Do you think Œ this is 
a hindsight kind of
 question, but do you think that the 
danger, the sense of danger, came to him too late? 

 
Interview with NormanMiller  
 
April 15, 2013 
 

 
 
40
A: We-Well, when you talk
 about danger, I Œ I Œ I wo
uld assume Œ you Œ you know, 
these killing camps were no Œ weren™t exis
ting at that time. 
So nobody had the 
faintest idea what the future would bring. 
I would say that in in their mind, they felt 
we had to get out; we were restricted, we 
were persecuted. But th
ey figured, there is 
going to  be a war, which eventu ally ends, an
d sooner or later we™ll be out of here, 
you know? That™s Œ that™s Œ th
at™s my feeling. I mean, th ey
 Œ they tried. They tried 
to get out. They  had reports from friends in 
this Œ that emigrated to here, that was not 
too ro sy, you know. I Œ I just translated one
 of letters, and th e Œ the Œ the cantor of 
the synagogue, who was here, he writes he just lost his position. He™s now selling 
canned goods. You know, it™s Œ 
Q: It™s hard for Œ yeah. 
A: It™s 
[indecipherable]
 you know, it Œ it didn™t pull him to Œ to ye Œ ye Œ and Œ and 

Œ and always grandma being left 
behind was on his mind, and so Œ 
Q: Oh, and no Œ it sounds like 
a hellish position to be in. 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Because there™s so many unknowables. 

A: Right, right.  
Q: How did Œ do you rememb er how you fe
lt as you were receiving these letters, one 
after another? And what were you writing 
to th em about this Œ should Œ were you

urging th em to leave, were you Œ were 
you in Œ did you men
ti Œ comment on that 
situation, or were you writing more 
about what was going on with  you? 
A: Well, mostly wh at was going on with me. 
They Œ they were in
 Œ you know, they 
were, of course, very interested in my life.
 I was happy to receiv
e letters from them, 
and vice versa, they, you know, receiving the 
letters from me. And they wrote to me 
about their lives, and he was very active.
 And they still had cultural happenings. 
Q: Had he lost his job? 
A: No. 
Q: So they™re stil
l with the school? 
A: But later on Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ later on Œ so, in this last letter I tr
anslated , the people, yo
u know, in the ground 
fl Œ ground floor were just
 going Œ leaving, and he wa
s Œ they were consid ering 
moving down into the ground
 floor, and th ey  mentioned it™s Œ it™s cheaper and they 
had some reduction in the Œ in
 the income. And he was ve
ry active in these cultural 
performances he put together even before, 
you know, before the war, where we were 
restricted of attending cultural perform
 Œ you know, happenings. He formed 
orchestras and he had the mu
sical events, concerts, and he was leading them. And he 

writes about the Œ the dep Œ having a Œ pe
rform in the old age home, or in the 
schwester haus
. I don™t know what that means. 
Schwester heim
, or something.

Q: 
Schwester haus
. 
Schwester heim
. That™s interesting. 
A: I Œ I Œ I-I da Œ I don™t Œ but he menti oned it many a times. And then at the Œ at 
these performances, he acted as 
MC
, you know, and he had that quartet singing and 
my  Œ my  sister was playing the harmonica 
and all Œ you know, all these details he 

wrote to me, and Œ 

Q: Did you feel Œ 

A: Œ and Œ and then , a-at one ti Œ we
 were talking about the school Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ in Œ in 
Fürth
. He, in one of his letters, h e me
ntioned that the Œ the Œ the school 
in 
Fürth
 was closed, and he Œ th ey got some
 pupils from there in their school. 
Q: I see. I see. So the school 
still was operating, even children Œ 
A: Yeah, they had Œ they Œ their school wa
s operating, and ev en th ey had the service, 
religious service in the 
turnhalle
, you know, in the gymn asium. 
Q: Did you get letters from yo
ur mother and your sister? 
A: Yeah, my mother™s and grandmother™s 
and you know, they in cluded a few lines, 

or a whole page; sister, grandmother and my mo ther. 

Q: What did they write about? 
A: Well, you know, about they ™re happy that
 I™m fine and you know, my sister s Œ 
didn™t come home in time, or they were 
stopped on Œ on a bicycl
e tour because she 
and her friend was riding to

-they were fined and you

know, the day to day oc-occasi Œ happenings
, which sh Œ sort of showed  that they 
were, you know, still going on tours, and na
 Œ in a Œ nearby things, you know, for the 
day. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But we were restricted 
in, your rights, you know, lik
e in normal times I would 
still take the letter to the post office, but 
you know, you can™t take Œ can™t leave the 
house. He arranged some things Œ he invent
 Œ he could have invented something to Œ 
for the windows, for the lighters and shin
e, you know, at night
, and probably they 
had the Œ they had pr Œ probably  had air ra
ids. I mean, he didn™t Œ he didn™t talk 
about that, because the letters
 were censored many a times. 
Q: So did you get letters? I 
mean, did you get all the lett
ers you th ink that he sent? 
A: I would say so. But I ha
ve about 20 - 30 letters. 
Q: That™s a lot. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: That™s a lot. 
A: And then  also, a couple of times we Œ we
 ha Œ we cou Œ were able to send a Red 
Cross message, you know, like 
20 word s, or something like 
that. I sent it, and then 
he was allowed to have return with 
20 wo rds, you know the Œ on his side. 
Q: Do Œ do you have the fee

44
A: Yes, right, right, right. 
Q: Œ these sort of norm Œ the more
 normal things that were going on? 

A: Probably. Right, right, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And nevertheless Œ 
A: Well, then Œ then  Œ and then  Œ I Œ the 
Œ you know, like in the re Œ letters I must 
have written, you know, some Œ some Œ some
 things, that we were issued the gas 
masks in 
England
, you know. And then he, you kn
ow, he had a good sense of 
humor and he wrote, don™t Œ 
or keep your onion peeling in
strument close, you know, 
so you Œ of Œ that™s
 Œ you know, and Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and it Œ he tried to set some
 Œ the jokes, he was telling us 
[indecipherable]

usually it was a play on words which in Ge

Œ 

Q: In translation. 
A: Right, right. 
Q: What were you writing him about
? What was going on in  your life? 
A: Well, you know, the Œ the Œ the Œ about

I visited, you know. I had an uncle and 
aunt who also waiting out their quota number to go to  the

of

addresses of people he knew lived in

Ta nn

A: Well, I Œ I have to  Œ I have to
 go back a little bit about my life in

Q: Of course. 
[break] 
This is a continuation of our interview with Mr.

exchanged with your parents, that would ge
t to you in a roundabout way, that would 
get back to them Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ in a roundabout way, 
and so  on. The last letter th

A: Right. 

Q: It was more like a good year and a half. 

A: Right. 
Q: That you had had this correspondence.  
A: Right, right, right. 

Q: How long did it usually take, you know, 
because this was such a roundabout way, 
the intervals between letters. Would it be 
a month, two months, and Œ or less than 
that? 

A: Less than that, they were
 quite frequently , every couple
 of weeks, especially in 
the beginning, you know, wh en  
the Œ when they went to 
Belgium
 and then from 
there on to 
England
. Later on, it took a while the Œ 
for a letter to come to me, you 
know, it came to the 
States 
first. And Œ 
[interruption] 
Q: Okay, all right. So, the last letter you 
receive is May ™41. When do you start

A: Well, I Œ I™m Œ there were a couple of
 Red Cross me ssage Œ me ssages, and I think 
I sent one off, and I never got a reply. The 
ma Œ the Œ that probably was th-the Œ the 
last I got, you know, correspondence. 
Q: What was going through your mind? 
A: I Œ I can™t recollect. I Œ I don™t Œ I 
Œ I don™t Œ I don™t re
memb er. I don Œ you 
know, the Œ there™s certain things you so metimes shut out. 

Q: Of course. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Of course. Were you Œ we
re you making further atte
mp ts, beyond th e Red Cross, 
as the months went on, to
 find out what was going on? Or was that not possib Œ 
A: No, I have a copy of a letter where 
I made some inquiries about my  parents, 
through the Œ wh en I wa
s in the English army. 
Q: But that™s already later. 

A: That™s later. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Right. 

Q: During th at Œ those first months, and 
let™s say year, did you
 Œ yeah, did you w-
wonder if they were 
still in their own home? 
A: A-A-All along, you know, 
the feeling was that you kno
w, we get togeth Œ we Œ 
we Œ we meet again, and we 
Œ you know, they  Œ when  th 
Œ either th-th-they leave Œ

they are able to leave, or

again. 
Q: So you didn™t doubt 
that they were alive? 
A: I didn™t know. I Œ I Œ we Œ you know, 
we di Œ we Œ we didn™t know about the 
camps a Œ you know, l-looking at it from wh
at we n-now know Œ at that time, you 
couldn™t even imagine th-these
 killing camps existed, or Œ 
Q: So you didn™t know, but you also
 didn™t think the worst things Œ 
A: No, I didn™t Œ no, I di
dn™t think the worst.  

Q: Tell me Œ I mean, we™ll Œ 
we™ll go back to  Œ to wh at
 your life was in Œ in Œ 
A: In
 England
. 
Q: In 
Britain
. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But first I want to follow that Œ that s 
Œ that part of your 
story as to how you 
continued, when  you did continue, to try 
and find out about them. And when  was the 
first time you fo und out anything? So May ™
41, it all ends, the letters stop. And then 
when is Œ is it when you were
 in the army, truly, that th
e next time was that you were 
able to do something? 
A: Ma-Made Œ made inquiries and went through the army , you know, that was in Œ 
but that was actually the Œ after the war, 
you know. The was s Œ ended May ™45, and

time period where, you know, yo

 that would be quite a m
un Œ you know, significant 
mo men t  to  Œ

my father, but I Œ I Œ I don™t 
know if that really is so. 
Q: If it was him. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And then later I Œ I got so
me other books with, you know, the terrible

A: N-No, he wasn™t a friend. He just Œ well,
 you know, they Œ he 
and his fami ly were

proves that they lived in 
Nuremberg

my parents lived the early
 days of the war in

 ju st recently, couple of Œ maybe a year or

Œ the head of the Nazis in 
Nuremberg
, planned to have 
a mu seum of Œ a-a-after the war, of the s Œ 
the sou Œ th ose people, lost tribe th Œ of 
Jews. And he collected all kinds of Jewi
sh articles, books. An
d they  found books 
that belonged to my father. And we went to 
Nuremberg
 to the library. There was a 
whole section of hundreds of books that we
re supposed  to be in th at mu seum. And 
there were maybe Œ maybe eight or so that
 belonged to my fa
ther. And they traced 
me through 
Yad Vashem
, and th is Œ and not Œ not th Œ 
not directly to me, but I had Œ 
a cousin of mine made inquiries also
, and th ey went Œ contacted her in 
California
 
an-and they informed them
 that I™m Œ I exist in 
New York
. So we went there to look 
at the books, and there™s a Jewish librarian 
who is i-in Œ in charge of that, and we 
went there and we took a few 
of those books, I have them 
at home. It™s mostly on the 
liturgy, you know, the Œ the sy
nagogue services. A really  bi
g, heavy book that my f-
father studied.

Œ comme mo rative date of when a person had died. 
Q: I see. 
A: And we light candles o-o-on
 that particular day, yah Œ 
Yahrzeit
. 
Q: And it™s inscribed, let™s say, in a book, 
or in a Œ in a certain kind of a book? Is it 
like in the Bible, or Œ 

A: Well, that™s Œ in the olden times maybe 
people used  to do that, but no, we Œ we Œ 
we don™t Œ we Œ 
Q: But the book Œ I™m talking ab out th
e books that you got 
from that library.

ther™s. She had an 
inscription, you know, in memo ry of Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ her husband, or maybe her father, I 
da Œ I don™t remember. So we went there 
and we got Œ we Œ we Œ h-
he sent us some books 
[indecipherable]

heavy books. And ev entually we
 probably  donated th em to Œ that™s when we went to

not existing memo rial in the street, it Œ 
that Œ the Œ th-the synagogue was there Œ

you know, they  Œ th ey have 
beautiful shops and traffic 
and you know, it™s Œ it seemed the same. 
Q: So, I mean, did Œ was the 
city recognizable to you? 
A: Well, it still Œ you know, it Œ it Œ it was an
 old city, there was a wall around the 
city, and a Œ and a moat. You know, part of
 that still existed, there was a castle on 
the hill, and that existed. But otherwis

A: English mo stly. And Œ and in  Œ

Germany
, I 
didn™t want to speak German. You know, I

l-later on, you know, I did quite a bit of trav

came across Germans. I didn™t want to Œ I di

to them. And when I 
heard the German language, it Œ it Œ it Œ it s

care for it. I d Œ I Œ I Œ I hated hearing it.
 But we didn™t spare Œ speak German, you 
know, just word s, we spo Œ with her pa
rents maybe, we spoke German. But after a 
while I Œ I Œ you know, I wasn™t fluent in

agic trajectory of 
your family; your mo ther, your fath er, your
 grandmother, your sister. And the last 
time you heard from them, and the unanswered Red Cross messages, or messages 
through the Red Cross. Tell me, from that 
time, from let™s say mid-1941, wh at was

rvised your life, so after I went to a Rabbi
 
Munk
(ph), who then  sent me Œ well, he a-a
pparently contacted that organization. 
They sent me to a place in 
Croydon
 where there were other refuge Œ about maybe 
40 re-refugee boys. And then, little while later, I was sent to a school in Swiss 

College part of 
London
, a Œ a boarding school, but I only stayed there few Œ two Œ a 
few weeks, maybe a month, and then ag
ain there Œ was sent to a Rabbi ren Œ

housework. And he found jobs
 for us, and I work ed in  a factory, and then, having a 
fair knowledge, or a little kno
wledge of weld ing, I Œ I got
 a job in a machine shop, 
and I worked there for a while
. You know, you Œ you Œ you 
had the Œ you start at the 
bottom, cleaning up and getting sandwiches
 and I didn™t Œ my English wasn™t tha-

know, this was the east end, and there was a l Œ a lot of bombing, German air raids. 

It was near the wharfs. An
d so the company evacuated 
somewhere in the country, 
not too far, you know, 
one of the smaller towns outsid
e. So I commuted there for a 
while, and then I stopped, and I got another jo
b back  in Œ in east 
end. I worked there 

s Œ it was a scientific in strument company,
 machine shop type of work . And well, as 
I said, a lot of air raids.
 We Œ we watched Œ i-in 
London
 they had Œ they had a lot of 
balloons up, you know, to make it mo re diffi
cult to get Œ for the planes to get lower, 
difficult to have a straight run.  

Q: How would a balloo Œ I mean, this is ju
st my lack of technical knowledge Œ how 
would a balloon hinder a plane? In what way? 

A: Well, maybe they interfered with the Œ wi
th their flight plans or Œ or something 
like that. And th en we se Œ we saw dogfi
ghts also, you know, the Œ the British planes

attacking the German planes, and you s Œ 
sometimes you saw them sh Œ sh Œ being 
shot down, or y Œ or you Œ at times you di
dn™t know where the Œ this was the English 
arm Œ a German plane was shot down. So, 
there was a program where they had what 
they called 
Anderson
 shelters in the backyards of th
e building Œ of Œ 
of the houses; 
in the garden, they 
d Œ they dug a hole in th e grou
nd. Then it had corrugated iron, 
and then some more so il on top. That™s wher
e we used to sleep at during the nights. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And I also was asked to sleep at our
 place of j Œ wo rk, you know, under the 
benches a Œ a few times during the week, 
because they had these fire bo-bomb s. 
These were sa Œ you know, th-they started a 
lot of fires, small. So we had sandbags 
and Œ in order to suffocat
e, you know, the flame. 
Q: Did it actually happen? 
A: Ye-Yeah. 

Q: I mean, there was an antic
ipation, but did it actually 
[indeciphera ble] 
A: No, no, sure, they had the 
fire, they had these Œ you know, th-they started th-the Œ 
the, you know, firebombs, a
nd Œ by Œ by the hundreds 
as Œ they dropped these 
things. So I Œ I worked, and 
I lived in the Œ with that

Q: Can I ask here; what authority Œ what
 British authority, or government authority 
was the one that kind of regulated your life? 
A: I don™t think it was a Œ a govern ment, I 
think it was a Jewish private organization. 
Q: I see, so  Œ 

A: I think 
Bloomsbury
(ph)
 Ha ll
 was in the name of the organization. Also the Œ the 
Œ I-I guess they were in charge of bringing the 
Kindertransports
 to th-the Œ to the 
States
 and find them homes. So, 
I lived in this place, 
Clapto n
(ph) Œ you know, I 
used to play the che 
Œ cello, and I want to something mu
sical, so I bought a clarinet 
in a pawn  shop, and Œ but I had to give
 it up very soon, because we slept in a 
dormitory, you know, a whole bu
nch, and as soon as Œ that™s the only place I could 
practice, and you know, as soon as you try 
to do th at, someone wants to sleep, and Œ 
I also had a Œ a Œ a bad experience. 
Q: What happened? 

A: You know, I Œ I didn™t earn mu ch money, 
but I tried to save as much as I could, 
and I had a Œ a pa Œ a post office savings bo
ok, and one day I ha Œ I kept it in a little 
table next to the bed, and it disappeared. So 
I went to the director of the Œ that Œ th e 
place, and he went straight to
 one particular person, and he
 had it. So, he must have 
had some previous record. So after a while Œ 

Q: Did th at mean you lost your savings? 

A: No, he Œ he Œ he had Œ he 
had Œ he had my  book, you know.

, later on a few of us move
d to a board ing house, you 
know, English board ing house, about four 
of us, and th en d
ecided, you know, 
decided to join the army
, volunteer in the army. 
Q: Can I interrupt? At this point I want to 
ask, a lot of refugee kids, particularly who 
had been on 
Kindertransport
, who came from 
Germany
 or 
Austria
, so meti mes 
were classified as enemy aliens Œ 
A: Oh yes Œ 
Q: Œ by the British government. 

A: Right, right. 
Q: So I wonder, wh at was Œ wh at Œ wh at happened  to you? 
A: Well, when I wa Œ when  I turned 16, I 
had to appear before a tribunal, and I was 
classified, friendly alien of enemy origin. 

Q: So, had it changed a little by then. 
A: Ri-Ri-Right, you know. I Œ I know others 
that were interned a-a-at that stag e.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Later on I was thinking maybe living w
ith a rabbi, and maybe there was some  Œ 
maybe he had some influence, or they r
ecognized that I™m not really a dangerous 
person. So I, you know, 
was a friendly alien.

A: Right. 
Q: All right. So Œ so  that experience is 
one that you avoided, of being in terned. 
A: Right, yes, I was Œ  
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ not interned. And I ear Œ I Œ I Œ I ma
de some English friends, one particularly, 
and he went in the air force. So, I wanted
 to  get Œ you know, I thought Œ you know, 
my  friends to Œ do their duty, I have Œ yo
u know, I Œ I ought to do something. You 
know, I joined too, and I tried to get in 
the air force. And I Œ you know, I appeared 
before a board and I re Œ I Œ I was refused. 
It was be Œ I Œ I would say because of the 
German background. You know, if you had 
been Po lish or Czech, where they  had 
Polish people in the air force, maybe it woul
d have been  made lighter, easier. So Œ 
Q: Was that disi Œ was that very disappointing for you? 

A: Yeah, yeah, sort of, you know, right, ri
ght. So then  I volunt
eered for the army, 
and I would Œ and I figured  maybe with my

into engineers or something lik
e that. Well, they put me in
 the infantry. First it was, 
you know, begin in 
Londo n
. It was the Royal Fusiliers. 
Then was basic training, and 
when  that was over, th
ey needed ra Œ it was already 
towards the end of the war, you 
know. They needed rein
forcement. As a matter of fact, 
I s Œ I saw in one of my  army  
books, a notation about Far East. I think 
th ey were going to send me Œ vaguely  I 
remember they were going Œ 
you know, they had 
everybody lined up 
to go to the Far 
East, and I said I speak German, and then
 they  changed by it Œ you know, sort of 
destination. And, you know
, I had my  medical basic tr
aining. And then  we were 
flown over to 
Belgium
 as reinforcement, and I joined the 53

 division, which was a 
Welsh division. 
Q: What year was this? 
A: It was f Œ 40 Œ beginning

A: Right, right. So  Œ and I Œ and it Œ in th

Welsh fusiliers. On Œ a-a-at that stage of th
e war, they had sort of
 cur Œ columns with 
tanks ahead, just moving until th
ey hit resistance, or Œ you know. So, at Œ well, in Œ 
in my  platoon already, the lieutenant found 
out that I speak German, so he kept me 
close to him. And one day, you know, th
e Œ a-and afterwards, the comp any, you 
know, that™s the next stage, found out
 I cou Œ you know, there was a German 
speaker, so I was transferred to 
the company headquarters. And Œ

Q: As an interpreter, as a translator? 
A: Oh yes, interpreter, yes. You know, I 
still had my rifle and, you know, all that 
stuff. And while I was there, my platoon 
was riding on tanks th
at were, you know, 
just traveling into 
Germ any
, and they were ambushed, 
and Œ and you know, they  
were sitting on the tanks, and 
a whole bunch of them got 
killed, and some captured, 
and some wounded. So  I escaped that. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And soon after, when the battalion he
adquarters realized 
there™s a German 
speaker, they put me in the 
intelligence section of the ba
ttalion. So, you know, we Œ 
we Œ we had Œ we had sa
 Œ we still had some fighting on the way in to 
Germany
. I 
ha Œ I ke Œ I kept a little diary, and I put
 down every little town we passed through.

Q: I want to step back a bit. What was 
your job in the intelligence work, when you 
were now on comp any level, I believe, and 
you were part of the Œ wh at did you do? 
A: I li Œ 
[indecipherable]
 because there was not Œ th -there wasn™t mu ch to Œ you 
know, at that time ther
e wasn™t much to do. 
Q: Okay . Did you Œ 
A: And in Œ verg  Œ you know,
 maybe th Œ if there was a

know, asked a Œ a Œ a few questions. I-I Œ 
I don™t Œ I don™t Œ I don™t rem-remember. 
I™m Œ well, I Œ yes, you know, wh-w hen we

always called Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ to i-interpret. So in Œ in 
Hamburg
, we stayed there for 
a while, and we couldn™t

know. So I was there quite often, and one
 day a Œ a limousine came by and it was sto 
Œ you know, the Œ the Œ the Œ the people, the platoon, th ey stopped the Œ the car, and 
looked at the papers, and they
 went to a German policeman and asked, are the papers

lance corporal, wasn™t quite sure. He cam

real Œ realized, we have a big Nazi fish there. 
Q: Oh my goodness.

Poland
. You know, the

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: He later was executed in 
Nuremberg
. So, it was Œ 
Q: Was his name on those papers? 
A: Well I Œ I Œ so Œ ma Œ ma Œ I Œ you kn
ow, when  I think about it now, maybe he 
was on th e way to give himself up, I Œ I 
Œ I don™t know, because he came from the 
east, you know, and the Russians were co Œ 
right behi-behind him. So, I had Œ I had 
him arrested, and then they
 called the Œ the colonel, the, you know, battalion 
commander. He had his picture taken, an
d then there Œ he was sent on to  
Montgomery
 headquarters.  
Q: Di Œ what did Œ what did Œ I 
mean, that™s an amazing event. 
A: Right. And I have proof of that. 
We had a new Œ a Œ

Q: What was his deme anor? 
A: Œ I don™t remember. I Œ I don™t know if 
Œ I don™t rememb er. It™s another of those 
moments. Ma-Maybe when I was there, he 
didn™t come out of the car. I Œ I Œ I don™t 
remember. Like I said before, tha-that Œ 
tha Œ there™s another Œ another incident I

ink it was an engineering unit of the army, 
and some officer sort o f took on the de
tails and, you know, I had a oath, and I 
became a B ritish subject, they called it. 

Q: Were there requirements? I mean, did 
they  require what people would require 
after the war, or was it that you had serv
ed in the military  a
nd that was enough? 
A: No, no, that™s separ Œ sep Œ 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Well, let™s say I put in an application,
 and during the war they just filed it, 
because they Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I™m not sure 
if I™m right, but I think even Prince 
Philip
 
wasn™t Œ became British til after th e war. 
I don™t know whether Œ where Œ where I 
got that, but that™s what I her Œ he
ard. So th e Œ so I went back to 
England
, to the

en I joined the army , my  employer didn™t 
want to let me go. And h-he put in an app
lication that Œ you know, that I would stay

Friuli
, 
which is on the border to 
Yugoslavia
; I never had heard of it. And Œ 
Q: What would you have wanted  to tell hi
m a b out your gra Œ about your father? You 
know, what would you want him to know abou
t your father, again in a Œ as a person? 
And the question™s also gonna
 be reversed to, what w
ould you have wanted your 
father to know about your children? 
A: Well, he Œ well, h-he wo
uld be very, very  proud of 
them. But n-now that you say 
that, I also have to bring up
 my  wife, who, you know, as 
Œ I would say my  sons were 
closer to the Œ my wife than to me. My wi
fe was very Œ an avid
 reader, and both of 
my sons are. 
Michael
 can™t do it now, he has Œ doesn ™t have the time, but

Q: Sure, that™s right. 

A: And it Œ you know, m-my  Œ

and we, especially me, you 
know, when we leave 
Mi-Michael™s
 house, we often t-talk, 
you know, how Œ what a 
shame that my wife couldn™t enjoy th-the
 grandchildren. And she would be a great 
grandmother. A very warm person. And like 
I said, she was a Œ 
more outgoing than 
me. 
Steven

A: I never Œ never thought of that. I never

a teacher, he was very much Œ the wer Œ 
e-education was very important to him. 
Knowledge, you know. My mo ther less so,

. And you know, I 
have pictures here where the Œ wh-where 
the whole fami ly went bicycling. I have 
pictures of Œ of us
 in front of the 
Lorelei

Rhine
 with four bi Œ four bicycles. 
Now, if you ask me how we get there, I do
n™t reme mb er. I have pictures of the four 

of us Œ actually five of us, as a Œ a cousin

d  my  min d .  S o , my  fa
ther, we liked the 

outdoors, we liked to doing things. My fa
 Œ we Œ we were all Orthodox. Bu t not Œ 
well, maybe in this Œ in this countr
y it would be simila
r to a ya Œ young 
Israel
, 
which is all Orthodox, but not extreme. A
nd we Œ I Œ like I belong to a congregation 
Œ 
Q: I was going to ask you ag ain. 

A: Since maybe 1960, when  Œ in  the Œ 
in the 60s, when my kids were Bar 
Mitzvahed, and I™ve been a member ever 
since, and paying my  dues, and supporting 

the synagogue, but I™m not religious. I Œ I d

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Œ also during the year, once every six 
weeks, or s Œ you kn
ow. I™m not learned, 
overly. I-I know quite a bit. I wouldn™t be
 surprised that my sons who are more 

studious, know more in certain respects th
an I do. I would say that, if my  parents 
would have come here and ha
d to  Œ th-th Œ maybe they  
would be less religious if 
they had to be, than 
they used to. But year
s ago, they  followed  
all the Œ the rules. 
And my  father was pretty learned, a

Q: Some passages?  

A: Wa Œ well, he Œ he compared my trip to 
England

incidents with the, you know, train and 
Kindertransport

some Biblical occasion where one of the Œ abra Œ not

but I feel I™m de Œ a dependable perso Œ 
person, and th ey coul
d depend on me. I Œ I Œ 
I do a lot on Œ I-I™ve done quite a bit for ot
hers just lately Œ I don™t know if I 
mentioned this before. One of my neighbors
 died. He was 101 years old. He had no 
family, he never had ch ildren, they  never ha
d children. I wa Œ in 
Œ I live in my  house 
about 50 year Œ over 50 years, he came la
ter. And we weren™t rea
lly friends and Œ for 
quite a while. He was a fisherman. I never 
got fish from him. But later we got Œ you 
know, I did gardening in my  garden. He gave me Œ let™s say, he gave me a 
gooseberry bush, I gave him a raspberry 
bush, and you know, we got friendlier. And 
after a while, he Œ I visited Œ you know, I Œthey get older Œ I used to visit him every 
si Œ e-every week, let™s say Saturday or we
ekends, or Friday, if I couldn™t make on 
the weekends. I stayed there fo
r a couple of hours. He lo
-loved astrology and he used 
to try to teach me, and Œ but it went in one ear and out the other. And he ser Œ he 

came from 
Pola nd  Œ Poland
. He reached his old age by
 eating salamis and cheeses 
and vodka Œ drinking vodka. 
Q: All the healthy food. 
A: That™s right. So I Œ he always offered me
 a vodka, and Œ but he ha Œ he also ha Œ 
made a vodka fermented with the ch
erries in it, o-or strawberries. 
Q: Right. 

A: That™s still Œ tha Œ one I drank, but it s
till had a kick. And so 
over the years Œ then 
his wife died, and Œ and he 
had no plans wh atsoever. I Œ I took him to a funeral

home, I got him a plot in the Œ in th e ceme
tery, I got him a rabbi. And I realized he 
had no plans even before that, and I worked
 Œ I Œ I attended a woodworking shop in 
a senior center, and that orga
nization was Œ it Œ it Œ it was 
sort of sponsored ot Œ it 
was an organization Œ it was a center of an
 organization called Self Help. And so I 
went to a social worker and talked about hi
m, and then ta Œ got me in touch with her 
office, and I got him Œ a social worker fo
r him, and meals on wh eels. And I took him 
to a doctor once in a while, but there was 
another neighbor, a woman that took him 
even mo re to the doctor, got the medicati
on fo r him. I took him Œ I Œ I helped  him 
collect his Œ 
Q: Social Security? 
A: Œ ma Œ ser Œ the Œ his number Œ no, his 
numbers for filing the 
income tax, I took 
him Œ we went to the library , where it was free, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But you Œ first come firs
t serve. Then he got older, 
I go Œ I took him to some 
other place where he didn™t have 
t Œ where he had to pay for 
[indecipherable]
. I 
took him Œ this was the wors
t Œ I took him to Œ to voting, yet he cancelled my  vote,

A: So I Œ you know, he had Œ 
so  he had no relatives i-in  
New York
, he had a niece, 
and Œ who had two sons. But he
 wasn™t close, only lately
, wh en he got older, came 
around. So he Œ th-th-they 
Œ the other woman had power 
of attorney while he was 
still alive, and he put her and me in his will 
as executors. So for Œ he died a-about a 
year ago. And th ere was problems, there wa
s supposed to be a bro Œ a brother, so we 
had to se-se-search for a brother in 
Poland
, wh ich we couldn™t find. Everything got 
dragged out. Then the Œ the relatives, they
 contesting the will, it™s still not settled. 
We Œ just to Œ 10 days ago,
 we saw Œ that was my  job, you know. Well, the other 
executor got sick, so it was a
ll on my  shoulders. And just recently, I Œ I Œ and the 
house was in a mess, and I cleared it up, ma
king mo re presentable to be sold . So  I 

feel Œ 
Q: That™s pretty big. 

A: Œ I ma Œ I Œ a dependable person, and p-
previous to Œ there was another Œ I had a 
heart attack, and I got a Œ I met so mebody else
 in a Œ in a Œ in a hospital, an-and he Œ 
I looked after him for a while
, it was a sickly old man. 
Q: You know, I see a thread there. You 
have your father, who was worried about 
your gran dmother Œ 
A: Right.

A: Right, right. 

Q: Who was still part of the family . 

A: Right. 
Q: So, in some ways this sounds also like 
something that the fam

A: Mm. 
Q: And that™s Œ that™s a legacy. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I don™t want to put word s in your mouth Œ

that strikes me a s 
a thread. So you pu Œ 
A: I Œ I da Œ I Œ I ga Œ yo
u know Œ I mean, a-actually
, this is mutual. Somebody 
needs a ride to a doctor or something, if I™m
 available, I Œ I do 
it, but they do it for

anybody around nowadays. They  died, or

Q: Yeah. 
A: Another friend, just now, Ap ril the fifth, moved to 
Pennsylvania
 to one of these 
senior places. But I always say 
[indeciphera ble]
 you know, that if Œ for the last 10 
years or so. But now I realizes, there come
s a time where I have to make a decision, 
you know? I live on my  own, I manage very  
well. My memory is 
not good. Even  in 
speaking English, I Œ what they call seni
or moments, I got plenty  of those. 
Q: I got a few too. 
A: Heh-heh. So 
Michael
 and 
Steven
 and I, we went to a couple of these retirement 
co-communities, near where 
he lives, you know, up in 
Westchester
. Beautiful 
places. There™s one f-fairly new, overlooking the 
Hu dso n
 to 
New Jersey
. Beautiful 
inside, they have covered everything, work sh
op, the pools, very nice. But you need a 
million dollars to live there. And some of 
the others, and I don™t know, I Œ I™m not 
really such an outgoing pe
rsonality. I make friends, but 
you know, I have friends. If 
I, let™s say, we™re in an elevator, he starts
 speaking to, you know, complete strangers. 
That™s not me. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And I don™t know how I 
would Œ I would fit in, of course, but to make good 
friends again, I don Œ I don™t know. I had doubts.

Q: Fusilier 
Taylor
 was guard ing one of the approa
ch es to the bridge on Monday, 
May seventh, and at about 
four p.m. in Œ in the afternoon, a large, brown 
Opel
 
saloon swerved out of the middle of our co
nvoys and knocked over a couple of tins 
which were being used as a barrier. 
Taylor
 jumped on the runn
ing board of the car, 
and fo rced the driver, who was wearing Lu
ftwaffe uniform, to pull up. There were 
four men in the car, and one who spoke 
English said he ha
d papers for Field 
Marshall 
Montgomery
 to sign. 
Taylor 
then  asked a German policeman if the papers 
were in order and the German re
plied, yes. Still not satisfied, 
Taylor 
took the 
occupants of the car to Fusilier 
Miller
, the interpreter and 
Miller
 immediately had 
them taken before the 
c.o. Taylor 
returned to  his post on the bridge and a few 
minutes later one of the men he had arrested
 was marched onto the bridge again, and 
his photograph was taken with the 
c.o.
 and ad jutant. This man was the notorious 
Seyss-Inquart
. So th anks to th e vigilance of one
 of our battalion™s men, another war 
criminal w as in the bag. Terrific. Let™s put that in there. 
[off camera]

anything else you™d like us 
to Œ to capture on film?
