Good afternoon,

Answer: Good afternoon. 
Q: Thank you fo r coming to  talk to us, to 
share your story with 
us. Could you let me 
know a little bit about the begi
nnings of your story; wher
e you were bor
n; who were 
your parents; what you know ab out them? 
A: My name is
 Lily Kaszamerski
(ph) or 
Kaszamerska
(ph), and I was born in 
Warsaw, Poland Œ Poland. 
And my  parents™ names were 
Ada Berlind
(ph) 
Oberlanski
(ph). My father™s name was 
Ian Kaszamerski
(ph). I know that they 
both were born in po Œ in
 Warsaw
, I™m not sure, because I don™t remember them. 
And I also know that they 
Œ my  mo ther had a brother Œ her brother, and he surv ived  
the war. He managed to escape the war in the middle of the war, and find himself in 

Paris. 
And after the war he opened a nightclub. He was a mu sician. 

Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Zigmund Berlind
(ph). 
Q: And did you ever meet him?  
A: No. I met his wife many, many years late
r. I didn™t meet him,  he died in  1953. 
And I think that he found me ar
ound 1950 th Œ or, well, ™49.

Q: Uh-huh. So h Œ 
A: After the independent war in
 Israel,
 I think that that™s when he found me. 
Q: That is, he found out that you were in 
Isr ael. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But he never Œ you two never came together. 

A: No, he didn™t Œ but I think 
that it wasn™t enough time, 
just Œ but he wrote to me 
through my adopted mo ther, 
cause they corresponded in 
Polish, and I didn't know 
Polish at the time, already. I forg ot it. And 
the sad story about it, about the fact that 

I didn™t me et them, n-neither his or Œ him 
or his wife at that time, I Œ and th-the 
other sad thing is that I don™t have any tr
ack of that letters that gone between my  
adopted mother and himself. So, I don™t kn
ow anything. And I think that Œ that my  
adopted mother didn™t ask the right questions, because if she wo
uld, maybe I would 

know where I come from, str
eet, who were my parents, 
what did they do. I don™t 
know anything. 

Q: Well, this was my  next question, is 
wh at are your Œ what 
do you know of your 
family, and was he, your uncle, probabl
y th e only tie to be able to tell you 
something about them? 

A: Yeah, but what I want, th Œ all the things
 that Œ all Œ the only thing that I always 
heard from my aunt was that my moth
er was the most ele-elegant person in
 
Warsaw,
 but that didn't give me anything. 

Q: Yeah.

A: I know about my father that he was 
in the Polish army. And he won the, what 
they call 
Virtuti Militari
, which was the highest rank, highest award that been 
given to sold iers. And I also know that ne
ver been given to a Jew. So, he was the 
only Jew who got this award. An d I have it, 
I Œ I go Œ we got it through th e internet 
fro m th e P olish  army  mu seu m. 
Q: That™s quite amazin g . 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you reme mb er any Œ di
d you rememb er what your 
first language was, do you 
Œ 
A: It was Polish. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: But when I arrived to 
Israel
, to 
Palestine
 at the time, it was a mixture of 
German and Po lish and I don™t know what. 
Q: So tell me, do you have any early memo ries of
 Warsaw
 at all? 
A: The only one memory I have is that Œ I 
think we were very, very young age, that 
I am in a pram, in a baby ca
rriage, with my father, in
 a Œ in a park. And it was 
snowing, wintertime, and I remember what 
Œ wearing this snowsuit, white snowsuit, 
with a Œ with thing for Œ they call it 
mufa
 in Polish, for the hand, from 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It™s a muff, it™s a muff, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
6
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, muff. And I was all in white, 
and I remember myself Œ I think that Œ 
I Œ I™m not sure whether that™s real, but that
™s what I remember, lying in a Œ in baby 
pram with my father in th
e park. This is the early Œ 
Q: And is your f Œ do y
ou have any memo ry of how Œ wh at he looked like? 
A: I just think Œ I don™t know
 if Œ because I saw his pict
ures, so I don™t know if it™s 
my memory, or what ha Œ fro
m what I saw. But I Œ I remember so mebody very tall, 
very tall and very  beautiful. 
Q: And your mother? 

A: My mother I remember a little bit later, 
I think. My  mo ther had dark hair. Both  
of them had black hair, I 
don™t know how I got my  blond
e hair. And Œ and actu ally, 
the first mo Œ memory of he
r is for Œ what I thought that it was the beginning of Œ 
beginning of the war. It was a Œ a day th
at I remember b eing in a house, and 

everything, all the doors were open, and i-
it was plenty of movement on the street, 
and they ™re shouting and sh ooting, and pe
ople running. And the Œ I remember 
hearing th is gunshot, this boom, boom.
 And the Œ I saw my dog, I had the 
Lassie
 
dog, on the floor with  a hole in his he
ad and something red was coming out and I 
reme mb er my self Œ  I r ememb er me crawlin
g to the dog. And th en it was noise and 
the door bin Œ opened 
and the big soldier, he was a Ukraine Œ 
Q: How did you know that? 

A: Œ came in Œ I don™t know. I don™t know
 how Œ how I know. But I know I Œ I™m Œ 
I don™t know how I know that he was Ukrain
e. He was a big man. He lift me up into 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575

his arms. He had red ch eeks, and a horrible smell of alcohol from his mouth, and 
my  mo ther was screaming, and he was la
ughing and holding me in his arms, and 
laughing. That™s what I remember from th
em. Then the next thing I remember is 
being in a Œ quite a dark apartment. My 
mo ther was walking back ward and fo rw ard 
in the room doing th is, you know? And th
en I remember that it was a cupboard 

there, and my mother used to
 go in to the cu pboard . An d Œ 
Q: Did you go with her? 

A: No. I ler Œ I didn™t look Polish Œ I didn
™t look Jewish, I think. I didn't go with 
her. She was always very ha Œ going in to
 this cupboard , and then  one day she 
disappeared .  

Q: And, did your father disappear from your life by that point? 

A: Yes, at that time, an d I th Œ I Œ so
mehow, I was making connection between my  
mother™s walking so  the f Œ backward and 
fo rw ard in th e room, and the Œ doing this 
with the Œ the Œ the disappear
ing of my father. I don™t know if it™s rig h t or wrong, 
but Œ 

Q: But that was what you 
th ink your impression was. 
A: That™s what my impression was. And 
then she disappeared, and I was there in 
this house. I don™t rememb er the people ther
e. I just Œ somehow, again, I just know. 
And this is very strange thing, that I kno
w things. I don™t know if I™ve been to ld, 
cause I didn™t have anybody to  tell me about
 it, but I know th at it Œ the Œ that was 
out of the ghetto, and I Œ I assume  that my
 parents were Œ they didn™t Œ they didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
8
 
 
really live very Jewish life, and they pr
obably had a lot of friends. And my  Œ my  
uncle was a mu sician, and he had probably  
his own artist fre Œ friends. So, I assume 
that that™s how we go
t out of the ghetto.  
Q: So you th i Œ 
A: Or we™ve never been Œ I don™t think that
 we™ve been in the ghetto. I™m not sure, 
but I don™t remember. 
Q: So th is dark apartment,
 you don™t know where it was? 
A: Yeah, I don™t know where it was. I™m sure
 that it wasn™t in 
the ghetto. Somehow. 
Q: Do you think that your mo th er mi
ght have disappeared  because someone 
informed? 
A: I think that she™s captured
, she been captured, because 
I know that sh Œ later on Œ 
later on she was in a labor 
camp. She was wo rking.  
Q: And your father just disappears? 
A: It was the end of my  father, yeah. 
Q: And you never knew  wh at he did fo r a living? 

A: No.  
Q: And Œ 
A: Part of being in the army, wh
ich that we knew, I didn™t know. 
Q: And, you don™t know if, aside from yo
ur uncle, whether there were any other 
brothers and sisters that they had? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
9
 
 
A: No, there is a picture that they Œ because
 all these pictures been sent to me by my  
uncle, and that there is a picture that they ar
e in some resort, and there is a pictu re of 
my father, my mother, that 
was before they got married. It was fro m Œ because there 
is a date, 1 9 36. And it was my mother, 
my father, my uncle, and behind, it was 
written, Auntie
 Bronia
(ph), but I don™t know who sister she was. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So, who she was related to. 
Q: Auntie
 Bronia
(ph). 
A: Right. 
Q: And your mother™s name was? 
A: 
Adela
(ph) 
Q: 
Adela
(ph). So it™s a mystery. 
A: It is. The whole thing is quite a mystery.
 I mean that the Œ th
e fact that the Œ all 
these years, nobody sh
owed up, but they Œ th
ey Œ they lived in a 
place, in a big city 
like
 Warsaw
. They probably had frie
nds or relatives, family. Nobody ever, except 
my  uncle, nobody ev er showed up. 

Q: Well, from the pictures, th
ey look very well-to-do. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: As if they came from a very upper class family. 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. But still.

Q: What Œ what™s the next memo ry that Œ 
that you have, that yo
u can think of, that 
comes to m Œ 
A: The next memory I have is  that my mother is coming to take me from this house, 
from this apartment, and we are in a ve
ry crowded place in, it was probably  the 
Hotel 
Polski
 in 
Warsaw.
 And then we™re in a little 
[in d ecipherable] 
train, very, 
very small place, and people were just ne
xt to each other, and 
it was very hard to 
breathe. And people were crying and scr
eaming and it was Œ it was Œ and I was on 
my Œ in Œ on my mother™s ar
ms. And then I remember that
 we got to a place, door 
were opened, and the Œ they took 
us out, you know, like a cattle. 
Q: You rememb er this? You had this Œ 

A: I remember this. I remember this. I remember th
ey took us to sh
owers, very cold 
showers. And were Œ and plenty  of women 
together in this shower, and my mother 
put me on Œ on the floor, which was disgusti
ng. It was cold, and the water Œ and wet 
and th Œ and then sh e picked me up. And 
then, when we got ou
t of the showers, I 
was with her, and with  a man. The story goes
 that my mother Œ that be Œ I been tell 
Œ told later, that it was this arrangement 
that the German maid
 with the Jewish 
authorities or something, that
 they will exchange people
 who had a certificate to 
Palestine
 for German people who lived in 
Israel Œ 
in 
Palestine, 
at that time. T h ey 
were the 
T-Templers
, tho Œ the big communit Œ German community in 
Palestine.
 
And we know th at some of them really 
adopted the Nazi i-ideas. A nd the Germans 
wanted to exchange them, 
I think. So they 
announce that the people who has 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
11
 
 
certificate to 
Palestine
 will come to Hotel 
Polski,
 which was a hotel in 
Warsaw
, 
and they will take to Œ take us to 
Palestine.
 My mo ther found this man who had th e 
Œ on his papers there were, the woman and 
a child. But they were
n™t exist any more. 
So she paid him, she gave him the Œ wh
at she had. And we were with him. 
Q: Do you have any 
memo ries o f  h i m? 
A: I have a Œ I Œ I don™t know, it™s a Œ 
it™s Œ whatever it™s Œ 
wh at Œ  my  memo ry  
about him is Œ is something wer Œ very 
frightening. Really frightening, he was a 
very frightening man to me, because he Œ la
ter on we knew that he hit me and sort 
of abused me, not Œ not sexually, but he 
abused me. Because I 
Œ my mother been 
taken away. As we got out of those showers,
 my mother disappeared, and I left with 
the man. 

Q: Oh, so you never saw her after that time? 

A: I saw her, they took me to see her, she 
was in the hospital. And I thought that 
there is a hospit Œ there was a hospital out 
of the camp , but I k
now now that it was a 
ho-hospital ou Œ inside the camp. 

Q: So where were you at this point, were you in
 Wa rsa w Œ 
A: I was with this man Œ 

Q: And where was Œ 

A: Œ and they put me in the man barrack. 
Q: And, but where was the Œ wher
e was this taking place? Hotel 
Polski
 in
 Warsaw
, 
or was this Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
12
 
 
A: No, Hotel
 Polski
 Œ we took us from Hotel
 Polski
, put us on the trains, and we 
thought that this is th
e end of the Œ of the 
[indecipherable]
 and that we are going to 
Palestine.
 But instead they took us to
 Bergen-Belsen, 
the whole transport. 
Q: So, in  other word s, whether you had 
a certificate or not, it didn™t matter.  
A: No, th at what we had in 
Bergen-Belsen
 Œ I read about it. It was Œ we all 
considered to be the Pale
stinian Jew Œ Palestinians. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And they put us together in 
Bergen-Belsen
. But certainly they  didn™t take us to 
Palestine. 
Q: And they  didn Œ and there was no ex change. 
A: There wasn™t any exchange. 

Q: Wow, so your mother a-and this man, as
 terrifying as he wa
s, both of them got 
fooled . 
A: Sure. 
Q: Both of them t
hought that Œ that this was a ticket Œ 
A: Yeah, sure. 
Q: Œ out, and Œ 
A: Together with very many other people. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: People, yeah. 
Q: And so th e Œ so, you rememb er seeing 
her in the hospital, do you remember Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
13
 
 
A: Yeah, I reme mb er that somebody to ok me
, I don™t know who took me to see her. 
I saw her in the bed, and 
then they to
ok me away. 
Q: Did she say anything 
to you, do you reme mber? 
A: I don™t remember. I don™t remember. 

Q: Do you reme mb er anyt
hing of how she looked? 
A: Yes, I remember. S h e lo
oked very much like Œ like 
in the pictures, with her 
make Œ 

Q: She looked beautiful. 

A: Yeah. I think that she was a Œ that time 
she was very, very si
ck, because she died 
very soon after. She had 
TB, 
tuberculosis, so she died, 
and th at™s why did Œ they 
didn™t let her to leave with all the others, 
they left her there. And they next thing I 
reme mb er was I was on the top bed. You k
now they had those beds, with Œ and I 
was on top bed in th is barrack and there were
 other people there, about three people, 
or Œ few people left in the 
barrack during th e day, and I 
heard them talking. And I 
heard that they said something like, po
or child, her mother died. Something like 
that. In the same 
time, when they Œ 
Q: The men then, it must
 have been the men. 

A: Yeah, but they we
re talking between Œ 
Q: Themselves. 
A: Œ themselves. And I heard somebody hu
mming. So, always this kind of music 
and bad news. Well Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
14
 
 
Q: Was it a sad kind of melody, or was it a Œ 
A: I Œ I thought it sad s Œ I think it was 
a sad Œ it was a melody, I don™t know, it was 
just Œ and that™s came together
 with what they said, and 
I was lying there in the bed 
and listening to this. They 
probably didn™t think th at I™m listening, or didn™t 
consider me listening. 

Q: Were there other children in that barracks? 
A: No, th ere was only me. 
Q: It™s so unusual Œ 

A: Yeah, it was Œ 
Q: Œ to think that there™s a li
ttle girl in the men™s barracks. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what
 we know from other testimonies and th e stories that 
the women in the women barrack 
told Œ told us
 that they Œ they sa
w that this man is 
really very hard on me, and then  de
cided to take me away from him. 
Q: Well, in what way Œ first,
 let™s go back to  some of th
ose me mo ries of Œ of this 
man and Œ and in wh at way was he
 terrifying? Do you have any Œ 
A: He hits me. I Œ I remember. I remember Œ  
Q: You rememb er being hit? 
A: Œ me crying, yeah. I remember he hit 
me. I was Œ I was on the top bed, I couldn™t 
Œ I don™t know if I Œ if I walked at the tim
e, or not, but I Œ I couldn™t hold my  Œ my  
pee-pee and 
[indecipherable]
 and I probably did th e whol
e thing in the bed, and he 
hit me. And I rememb er. I remember that was terrifying. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
15
 
 
Q: Now, was he in the same bunk as 
you were, or was he in the next one 
underneath? 
A: Next one underneath. 
Q: Underneath. So you were in th
e top, and he was the next Œ  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you have a name for him? 
A: His na Œ name was 
Schein
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: His first name? 
A: I don™t know, I don™t know. 
Q: And you don™t reme mb er if you called 
him anything, like uncle or something? 
A: No, I don™t think so, don™t think so that  I called him anything. I just know that 
the women bought me for the bread rations
. They gave hi-him my  Œ bread ration, 
and that Œ you know, it was 200 grams of br
ead a day. And they gave it to him and 
they took me. 

Q: Do you remember that
? Being taken by them? 
A: I remember mi Œ myself in the women 
barrack. Now, there is a bla Œ black hole. 
There was a woman who to ok me, took care of me. Her name was 
Bronka
(ph), 
Bronka
(ph) 
Eismann
(ph) and she took care of me. 
Then, she was tra n sferred to 
another camp, to 
Vittel
 in France, because she had 
the French papers. She was a 
student in
 France
 at the time of the war, when th
e wa-w ar broke out. And then I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
16
 
 
was left alo n e again. And I don™t remember 
h er, at all. I just know because later on 
in life I met her, and she told me this stories about me. 
Q: What kind of stories did she tell you? 
A: She to ld me now I could Œ I was alrea
dy married and I had my  son, and we met 
again. And she said that she took me a
nd I was in a terrible condition. I was 

neglected and dirty and crying 
all the time an d she said that
 she had to Œ to clean me 
up. She stood out there in th
e snow, and I was full of lice.
 She said that she had to 
cut my hair 
[indecipherable]
 have real scissors, but wh atever she had. Sh e Œ she 
said, you had beautiful golden curls, and I 
was standing in the Œ in th e snow cutting 
every curl, and with every curl which been
 dropped on the snow, I cried, you see. 
She said, wh ere is your blonde girl Œ curl
s now? Anyway, wh ere are they? And then 
she said that she was te lling me stor
ies. She was telling me about re Œ 
Little Red 
Riding Hood
, was wal-walking this Œ in the fore
st, picking flowers, and I ask her 
what Œ what is flower? And she told me th
at she taught me how to eat properly, not 

like Œ you know, like a lady. How to Œ and sh
e used to Œ I Œ I wa Œ this Œ later ons, 
there is some s Œ I don™t know if this fro
m that time or some other time, but she 
used to cut a piece of bread for Œ you know
, a piece of st Œ she want Œ eat like a 
beast, that like Œ only eat like Œ eat like a lady. 

Q: Do you know wh at lang
uage you sp oke to her in? 
A: Polish. 

Q: Ah, so ev en though she had Fr
ench papers, sh
e spoke Polish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
17
 
 
A: No, she wasn™t Fr
ench, she studied in 
France
, she was Polish. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 
A: And then she said Œ she to
ld me that she Œ I started to walk, and she didn™t want 
me to have bad shoes, because I will ruin
 my legs. So she sn eaked into the shoes 
barrack to find me shoes. Which I thi
nk th at it was, you know, it was re-real 
dangerous thing to do. And she 
found me a pair of shoes. 
Q: What I™m amazed by is that a little girl 
is allowed to live at all in bu Œ in Œ 
A: 
Bergen Œ 
Q: Œ 
Bergen-Belsen.
 Now what Œ how was it Œ were
 you hidden from the German 
authorities, do you think? Did they
 know about your existence?  
A: I don™t know, but I know that I didn™t
 have a bed for myself in the women™s 
barrack.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I always slept with someone before, 
but probably in th e beginning it was with 
Bronka
(ph), and later on with somebody else. 
And then she said, 
when she had to 
be transferred, and sh e had to be taken aw
ay, she said on that 
day, she said Œ she 
said that she never Œ sh e didn™t talk abou
t it, because she didn™t want me to hear 
about it. Somehow probably , I heard. And Œ 
and th at day, when  she went Œ taken, 
she wanted to say goodbye to me and I di
s Œ just disappeared. And she looked  for 
me, but she didn™t have enough time. And 
then wh en she was on the other side of 
the gate, suddenly sh e heard this scream, a
nd she saw me  running to the gate. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
18
 
 
gave her something. Sh e Œ I put something 
in her hand. She put it in he-h er pocket. 
And then  she said, you know, you saved 
my life. What happened was, that Œ 
Q: Let™s hold onto this thought Œ 
A: Okay . 

Q: Œ for when the tape changes, okay? 

A: Okay, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. And it Œ one is coming out and an
other one is going in. I™m keeping th e 
audio running so  that nothing is interrupted 
at all. Okay, and let me say, this is a 
continuation of the 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Lily 
Cohen
. And you were at the point wher
e you were going to tell us about 
Bronka
(ph) and having her told  you many 
years later, that you saved her life. 
A: That™s what she said. 
Q: And there was something you ga
ve her, so tell us about that. 
A: So, she said that, before
 she went away, th e wo men and the camp  wanted to pass 
some kind of news about themselves to th
e relatives, an d they 
didn™t know that she 
is going to another camp, th
ey thought that she™ll be li-
liberated. And they sew in 
her coat, she Œ they sew names and addre
sses and the Œ and so me information. And 
it was all b een sewn to th Œ 
her coat. When sh e got into 
Vittel,
 they Œ they started to 
check Œ ch eck on her. They  started with he
r shoes, they  told her to Œ to open her 
shoes. And they gone up, and she was Œ she 
said, I was so white, I knew that this is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575

my  e Œ the end of me. And they  said, okay,
 take everything out 
of your pocket. And 
it was a little statue of 
Maria
 and the Œ and the baby. 
Q: Of the Virgin 
Mary
 and the baby. And th at™s 
what you had given her. 
A: Yeah. So sh Œ th-the guard
 said, okay, that™s all right, we are not that bad, we are 
not, you know Œ so she said, and that sa
ved my life. And I saw this Virgin 
Mary 
with a baby later on in life, she kept it. 
Q: And do you remember it, or yo
u don™t have a memory of it? 
A: No, I don™t have memory. I remember
 many things from the camp , but I don™t 
reme mb er
 Bronka
(ph). 
Q: And you don™t remember the little stat
ue, and where you wo
uld have gotten it? 
A: I don™t even, no, I don™t remember anythi
ng of th Œ her stories. Was like Œ it is 
like a black hole. And I tried so much to
 rememb er. I didn™t manage it. I thought 
that maybe that was the only good time 
that I have there, so it just Œ 
Q: What do you Œ what Œ do you ha 
Œ do you ha Œ you 
said you had other 
memo ries , man y  o th e r memo rie s?  
A: I have other memo ries. I don™t reme mb er the wo men who took care of me. I 
knew Œ I know that there were many women 
who took turns to take care of me. I 
don™t remember their faces. I 
just knew Œ know that they
 were exist. I Œ but I do 
remember that it was a camp just next to
 ours. And I rememb er
 nights, and people 
are standin Œ men standing there with thos
e traps. And Œ and the little hats, and they 
were always screaming and shouting an
d crying from that camp. And I was so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
20
 
 
afraid to go out night to do
 my things. And ev Œ I rememb
er this very, very vivid, I 
reme mb er t h is Œ 
Q: Were there other children in the women™s barracks? 
A: It was Œ there were two. It was the girl, and it was another boy. 

Q: Were they about your ag
e, or were they older? 
A: They Œ they were older. Th
ey  were older. And th Œ th
ey were with 
their mother. 
One of them, that I heard Œ I learned la
ter on, she was adopted by the Œ by th is 
woman, because her child was 
dead, and again, the papers. So she took a girl, and 
she just her Œ her son name was 
Avraham, 
she put 
Av rahama
. And that was the 
girl. And she brought this girl to 
Israel.
 And this girl, I Œ I never met her, but I met 

the woman, because she was visiting me
 on a regular basic Œ later on in 
Israel.
 So I 
kept in touch with her til th
e Œ her last Œ last day. And I Œ I remember Œ what I 
remember from the camp and all this time 
I Œ all my  memo ries are in black and 
white. 

Q: How odd. 

A: They™re all in black and 
white. Only  when we got Œ 
when we were liberated by 
the Americans, after th e train, which I™ll te
ll about it, and we got 
to this place which 
called 
[indecipherable]
 this when my movie starting 
in colors. So, the first time 
that I remember colors. 
Q: But it™s Œ I find it amazing that you Œ we 
don™t have dates for it,  but it sounds as 
if your beginning of darkness happens fairly
 soon after the war breaks out. That Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
21
 
 
that your mo ther and yourself are in a Œ in
 a Œ an apartment wher
e she has to go into 
the cupboard, and then
 you™re in Hotel
 Polski
, and then  you have a train to 
Bergen-
Belsen.
 What year could have this been, and th
e Œ the th Œ the other thing is, is that 
you must have been a small child as Œ 
a small baby anyway when you were in 
Bergen-Belsen
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ you know. So, in some ways it™s a mi
racle that Œ in many ways it™s a miracle 
that you survived the entire 
war incarcerated, whereas mo
st children would not have 
survived . They would have 
been fo und, discovered, gotten rid of. Because, how 
much could they work, you kno
w, and what was their value? 
A: Yeah. The only thing is 
the Œ th at the children that were Œ and now I learned 
about it more and more, the onl
y children that were surv 
Œ is survive the Œ all of 
them were with some relatives, either aunt, 
uncle, parents, one of the parents. I was 
the only one who didn™t have anybody. I cannot
 say that I Œ I came with Œ I didn™t 
come with anybody. Even
 the woman that, when 
we being taken out of 
Bergen-
Belsen
 to Œ it was April Œ no, well, before Ap
ril, it was the March ™45. I was with 
one of the women, but she 
was killed on the train. So again, I Œ I left alone. 
Q: Do you reme mb er her name? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er 
[indecipherable]
 face. I just Œ I remember one face, I 
have this face in front of me, 
it w as laughing and had those dimples 
[indecipherable]
. But Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
22
 
 
Q: You don™t know whose it was. 
A: No.  
Q: By th e time 1945 rolls around, it looks 
as if, from the documents you have, that 
it Œ you™re at least seven years old, so
mething like that. And a seven year old 
already can have certain memories Œ 
A: So th at™s what™s really Œ really am
azed me. I know from one of the testimonies, 
one of the ladies, the Œ this woman w
ho had th e ba Œ th e Œ the g Œ the girl,
 Nuta
(ph) 
Gudkowski
(ph), that she said that I was 
Œ she knows me from the Œ from the 
beginning. Well, she was with the pe-people in Hotel
 Polski
, and came on the same 
train, and being in th e same barrack. So sh e 
said that Œ that I was ol Œ four or five, 
and al Œ when we got out. So I don™t have
 any Œ again, I don™t 
know, I really don™t 
know. And I don™t have the memo ry o Œ I Œ 
now, when all this train story came up, 
and I hear stories of childre
n who were 11 years old, and 
10 year Œ no, 12 years old, 
they have a very vivid memo ry, and memo
ry in order, you know, they can tell a 
story. I don™t feel that I can tell a story. 
I don™t have it, somehow. I have pictures, I 
have, you know, so Œ 
Q: Images. 
A: Images. But I don™t have story. I get 
Œ I Œ I have mo re of a story when  we Œ 
when  we went out of Œ of 
Bergen-Belsen
, I remember us walk
ing this much, we 
walked about 10 kilometers. 
I remember that when we wa
lked out, it was a kitchen 
on th e other side of the Œ of the gate. And with a horrible smell, you know, the Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
23
 
 
with smell the Œ with the soup
 that they gave us was horrible, horrible smell. And I 
reme mb er that somebody ran into th
e kitchen, somebody ra Œ from the 
[indecipherable]
 and he Œ and he™d been sh ot, a
nd then somebody else ran into the 
kitchen, been shot as well. And my  adopte
d mother said that I was telling her this 
story and I said to her that it was a very 
funny story, a very funny thing, cause we 
were walking and so mebody ran there, a
nd su dden ly it was piff puff and the person 
fell on the ground. And there was another 
one, there was another piff puff, and the 
person fell on th e ground. It was very fu-funny. 

Q: Oh, a child, a child. So it™
s Œ but you don™t reme mb er telling this story, she is 
somebody who tells you ab out that.  

A: That Œ but I told Œ I Œ I reme
mbered Œ I rememb
ered the event. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t remember that I told them th
e story, but she reme
mber it. And then I 
remember that there 
Œ I remember that 
[indecipherable]
 and there were times th at 
there were many Œ there were German o
fficers are picking me up on their arms. 
You know, probably  I was a Œ you know, 
I was a blonde and blue eyes. Maybe 
that™s what saved me. 

Q: So, obviously  then, you were
n't hidden. If German office Œ 
A: No, I wasn™t Œ I Œ  
Q: Œ if German officer
s were picking you up Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
24
 
 
A: Œ I wasn™t hidden, no. No, I wasn™t hidd
en, no. I just didn™t have my  place, cause 
I always slept with somebody, 
but I Œ no, I don™t think so. 
Q: Do you reme mb er anything of how you 
spent the days? Do y
ou think you played 
at all? 
A: You know wh at, I don™t remember co
nversations. I don™t rememb er people 
talking. I don™t Œ part of the one that I heard about my  mo ther™s death, I don™t 
reme mb er, I don™t rememb er people talki
ng to me, or I talking to  them. I don™t 
reme mb er me talk in g .  

Q: I had a thought as you were talking 
earlier, did you feel completely alone? 
A: I felt com Œ I felt co-completely alone all my life. 

Q: That™s what my  other question was going to be. 

A: All my life. I felt Œ of course, I had the 
love of my  adopted  family and the Œ but I 
always felt sort of floating, no 
[indecipherable]
 like Œ like alone in the world. I 
always felt like no Œ this is 
my  Œ my  biggest memo ry and my  biggest feeling, being 
alone. At the same  token, I knew that I have
 only me for myself, and then Œ that I 

have to rel-rely on myself. It™s th Œ ther
e™s no trust. I couldn™t trust, especially 
[indecipherable]
. Never trusted them. When I came 
to the kibbutz, a
nd th Œ in my  
kibbutz 
[indecipherable]
 they all speak he Œ Polish, an
d they all tried very hard to 
make me fo rget Polish. And I, again I wa
s lying in the bed listening to two women 
speak in Polish. And they were talkin
g about how wonderfully Œ wonderfully I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
25
 
 
been, you know, recovered, and Œ and I was 
thinking to myself, 
they don™t know. I 
have a secret, and I™m not going to
 tell the secret to anybody. 
Q: What was your secret? 
A: My life in different place, that I don™t 
Œ I know that I live there, I knew that I was 
there. I knew that all the things that I Œ 
all th e Œ my memories were exist. But I 
didn™t want to Œ to tell them
. I felt that I better keep it to myself. And later on I Œ I 
thought that that will be Œ 
that was my strategy to how 
Œ somehow to assimilate and 
to survive. Because I came 
to a place that there were 
children with the mothers and 
fathers and they look so healthy and so  nice
. All the things that I wanted to be, and I 
wasn™t.  
Q: You mentioned having 
an adopted mo ther Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ later on, but let™s go back in  our Œ 
to the chronology of wh en  you™re leaving 
Bergen-Belsen Œ 
A: The camp. 
Q: Œ and you™re on th e train. 
A: Yeah, we were, again, on the train.
 I remember being with someone, and I 
remember that we weren™t ri Œ we were ridi
ng this train, again very  many, sort of Œ 
you know, many pe
ople sitting together, and there wa
s smells. I remember smell. 
And Œ and th a Œ then  I reme mb er heari
ng booming and shooting and then th e train 
stopped. And we went under the tr
ain. There was shooting. We ran Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
26
 
 
Q: Was it open train? 
A: Œ with  the woman. 
Q: It was an open Œ no roof on it? 
A: No, it was a roof Œ the train was partly
 cattle cars and par
tly passengers car. And 
probably we were in the cattle car, becaus
e it was very Œ too cozy. And there were 
shooting and the train stopped, an d we ran 
after Œ down  to Œ undern eath the train, 
and then I looked at this woman next to
 me, and sh e didn't move. She was dead. So, 
that was Œ 

Q: Who was doing the sh
ooting, do you know? 
A: The German. They wanted to
 bomb this train. Their pl
an was, initially, to get rid 
of the plane, to bomb it. And one of thei
r cars were full of 
explosions. So, wh at 
happened in the train, that
 the Œ this train, for a week was riding backward and 
forward, many of the railroads were bombe
d, so they had to go back. And on th e 
way they  picked up more workers from labor
 camps, so the train was full of Polish 
people from 
Bergen-Belsen
 and Hungarians and Finnish 
and all kind of people that 
they found. Were 2500 people on the trai
n. And th  Œ in th e end the pr Œ the train 
stopped near a city called 
Magedburg
(ph). 
Q: 
Magdeburg
, yeah. 
A: Yeah. And now, I remember that it was 
a Œ a train, and it was a hill here, and I 
saw there a German running aw ay, running,
 escaping. And ag ain somebody, some 
young so ldier came back and said, oh, don™t
 blame us, we™re not all the same, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
27
 
 
run away . And we s-stayed there. This wo
man next to me was dead, I was under the 
train. And then came the Americans. They 
were all chewing chew
ing gum. So they 
Œ 
Q: So they liberated y
ou from under a train. 
A: They Œ yeah, so 
I got out of the tra-train Œ from under the train and th ey came, 
and I ye Œ I don™t reme mb er if Œ but I k
now now that in the beginning it was one 
tank with two s-soldiers. A
nd then  they Œ they  went 
and they brought others, 
because what they saw there wasn™t very 
nice. There were plenty of people dy-
dying and dead. They  took pictures, 
there are pictures from that site. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And you™ve seen those? 

A: I don™t Œ I do-don™t see myself.  

Q: Mm-hm. But when you see the pictur
es, have you reco gnized some memo ry? 
A: I re Œ yes, very much so, because for 
years I Œ I always, in my memory it always 
was a hill. And then I saw pictures of this
 train, probably from the other side, which 
was a plateau. And I thought maybe it was,
 you know, my  memo ry and it™s not as 
accurate. But when I saw the pictures 
now, I saw that it was exactly how I 
remember it. And now the Œ 
the American came and they gave us Œ they Œ I 

reme mb er plenty of Œ of Œ so
rt of Œ plenty  of joy. And 
they gave us something very, 
very nice and sweet. Was chocolate. Which 
I never had before. An
d then they took 
us Œ now, I remember they took 
us to another camp, which was
 Buch enwald
, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
28
 
 
reme mb ered  it was 
Buchenwald
. I reme mb er my self now alone, standing in  the Œ 
in the line for food, you know, and walking 
there. And then they evacuated, they 
took the pla Œ th-the people and they put them to pi Œ two places
, Fursleben
(ph) 
and 
Hillersleben.
 And nobody took me, so they all 
left the camp, and I had my little 
doll that
 Bronka
(ph) made me, which at that time I think th at was leg missing, hand 
missing, whatever. And I was sitting with
 this little doll, alone. The whole place 
was empty. 
Q: This is
 Buchen wald ,
 or Œ 
A: 
Buch enwald. 
Q: 
Buch enwald,
 mm- h m. 
A: And Œ and th en it was a woman came back
, with her son. Sh e said because they 
all Œ they had trucks and all kind of vehi
cles, and she came back. She came back for 
me. She said, give Œ give hand to  
Tommy
 and come with us. A
nd I didn™t want to. I 
wanted to stay. I was talk Œ this time I wa
s r e mem Œ  I re memb er I was talk in g to  my  

doll. I was telling her that when everyone le
ft, I was telling her that she shouldn™t be 
afraid, because I am with her and I am ta
king care of her. So then the Œ this lady 
said, okay, again she ha Œ give hand to  
To mmy
 and come with us. 
Tommy
 was her 
son. I said, well, I can go by myself. And 
I went with them. I didn™t give hand to 
Tommy. 
And I went with them, and we were taken to 
Hillersleben.
 And was a 
beautiful, beautiful place. I remember s
unshine and be Œ remember little white 
houses, beautiful streets, and bougava 
Œ bougainvillea, which was Œ it was a Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
29
 
 
Q: So, it was a town, or it was Œ 
A: It was a town. 
Q: Town, mm-hm. 
A: It was a town that the fa
milies of the aviation forces 
lived. And we got the house 
there. I was with the 
Hilde
 
Huppert
, it was the name of the lady, and her son,
 
Tommy
. And the Œ oh, the flowers, that 
bougainvillea, that was the purple 
bougainvillea. 

Q: So you saw your first flowers. 

A: This was Œ I saw my flir Œ yeah, first 
flowers. The second time I saw this Œ this 
exactly flowers, the wa Œ pu
rple bougainvillea, it was in
 Œ in another war. In the 
Independent war, in 
Jerusalem.
 So, I remember Œ I reme
mber getting into this 
house, and they had bed with
 sh -sheets, white sheets. I n ever seen white sheets in 
my life. And 
Hilde Huppert
 put us in the bath, she pu
t me in the bath. And it was 
warm, and nice, and it wasn™t cold any more. 
It was very, very nice, I didn™t want to 
get out. And Œ and she put me in the bed. In
 the beginning I was with my  clothes, I 
wanted to  go on the bed, and she said, 
no, no, you c Œ you™re
 not allowed with  
clothes on bed. So  that was a nice time 
there.  I don™t know how long we were Œ 
Q: Who was she? Who was this lady? 

A: She was Œ she was one of those 
Palestinians. Her husband had the 
[indecipherable]
 send them the Palestinia
ns papers, the certificate. 
Q: So he was Œ she was a Œ a Jew from 
Poland
, or from Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
30
 
 
A: No, she was a Jew from 
Czechoslovakia
. 
Q: I see.  
A: She 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And she had had those Œ 
she had those certificates. 
A: Yes, all our barrack had the certificate. And some of them, like 
Nuta
(ph) 
Gudkowski
(ph), the one with Œ with
 the girl, her husband also Œ they  managed to 
run away because the Œ the Ge
rman in the beginning, th
ey Œ they were after the 
men. So some of the men managed to escap
e, and they  Œ some of them escaped to 
Palestine
. And that™s how they  send us the Œ th
e papers. So, I remember Œ at that 
time I rem Œ I rememb er 
Tommy 
was teasing me all the time. He said, you don™t 
have pa Œ father, yo
u don™t have mo ther, I have a father in 
Palestine
 and wa Œ we 
will see him, we go there. And I said, I don™t care. And Œ and then we Œ I don™t 
know how long we were in 
Hillersleben, 
but it was a beautiful place, a nice place. 
Somehow I had the feeling, I™m not sure because I didn™t Œ 
Hilde Huppert
 wrote a 
book, ﬁ
Hand in Hand with Tommy.ﬂ
 And I don™t rememb er that she mentioned it, 
but th Œ it is in my me
mory that she wanted 
Tommy
 to learn English. And she Œ she 
had someone and I was just sitting and lis
tening to th is. But again, I don™t know 
cause I Œ it haven™t been  mentioned and I 
didn™t ask her about it. But I Œ if I 
remember this, probably
 it was right. And then 
Hilde Huppert
 arranged Œ she met a 
Jewish rabbi in the American Army. Her name was
 Neueman
(ph). And she 
arranged for a children transport to 
Palestine. 
Somehow they managed to Œ to find 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
31
 
 
children who were from the age of six, seve
n, five and 20, they™re all children, and 
they took us there, it w as a big 
transport, and th Œ we got to 
Paris. 
I r e memb er Œ  
Q: But
 Tony
 wasn™t in there. 
A: 
Tommy
 was with us, I was with her, and with 
To mmy
. I was very much next to 
her, and we all went to 
Paris,
 and I remember the 
Eiffel Tower.
 We wen Œ been  
taken to Hotel
 Lutetia
, which was a Œ still is the hotel in 
Paris.
 At that time it was a 
Œ the hotel that they brough
t refugees. And then I Œ no, 
I remember that we been 
taken to a beautiful place, it was in the c
ountry. And we were there for three weeks, 
it was some kind of rehabilitation place, yo
u know, cause the Œ it was a river th ere, 
or a lake, and we were there, and it was 
very, very nice. And then  we got on the 
ship, and we taken to 
Palestine
. And we arrived in 
Palestine
 in the six, I think, 
sixth of July , 1945. 
Q: Did you play with othe
r children on that ship? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er myself 
p laying with anybody. I was with 
Tommy Œ 
Q: Did you play with 
Tommy
? 
A: Sort of. 
Tommy 
was a Œ sort of. I di Œ I don™t Œ I rememb er not Œ not liking him 
because he was teasing me all the time. 
And Œ but I was very, very attached to 
Hilde Huppert,
 felt very close to her, and she wa
s very, very nice. Very nice lady. 
She took care of me. B u t when we arrived in 
Palestine
, we arrived into another 
camp, which was 
[indecipherable]
 camp with Œ now there were other soldiers, 
different uniform, but that was a camp, with
 the barbed wire, w
ith the barracks. At 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
32
 
 
that time 
H ilde
 and 
Tommy
, I remember stand Œ coming
 there, and I was with 
them, and it was a tall man standing on th
e other side, and th ey went with him.
 
Tommy
 said, this is my father. And 
to  Œ and we went with him. 
Q: Oh, so you went with  them, too? 
A: The Œ no, they went 
Œ they went with him, 
and I left in the camp. 
Q: What a terrible feeling th at mu st have been. 
A: Was very terrible. But I already knew 
th at I am Œ I™m on my  own. Even when I 
was with
 Hilde Huppert
, and even when Œ when I wa
s with the children. That Œ 
maybe that I don™t rememb er them because 
I didn™t really develop relationship with 
them. I remember the first night in 
Atleet
(ph). They  gave us what we thought that 
they are Israeli Œ Israeli clothes. Shorts 
and khaki shirts, and I remember lying in 
bed, and this was near 
Haifa
, and seeing all the lights 
going by and was thinking 
that it™s an Œ it™s another place, it™s a new 
place. So that Œ that was Œ I don™t know 
how long I was in

Q: Okay . We™ll Œ time for a new Œ new tape, 
okay. We™ll wait a little bit, and have a 
change. 
[tape break]
 Okay , so why don™t we con
tinue talking. This is a 
continuation of the 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Lily 
Cohen
, and you are telling me about 
Haifa
, and your first night in  the new camp . 
Who are the soldiers who are surrounding it?
 What Œ what were the uniforms they 
were wearing?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575

A: Oh, th Œ the shorts. The British soldiers
, they have knee sock
s, knee-high socks. 
And di-d ifferent Œ different hats. They  
didn™t look so frighten ing like the German. 
But they  were soldiers, it was a camp. It 
was a line to food, and Œ and it was a barb 
wire, so it was a camp . 
Q: It™s Œ it™s something in 
your Œ in the sequence of ev
ents, that it sounds like there 
were people who were watching out for you, but it was all episodic. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: It was not some thread of Œ for exam
ple, a child alone in a camp like this, I 
would th ink there has to be somebody w
ho was responsible for the children who are 
alone in a camp like this, that th
e child then , you know, goes to. 
A: No, no. 

Q: And it™s just hard to imagine that there 
you are, a little child in a camp, and there 
isn™t anyone in charge of
 the children who Œ whom Œ 
A: No, no, no. I know from
 Hilde Huppert™s 
book that she said  when she saw me 
sitting there alone, she said, ah this is Œ tha-that was 
Lily, 
the girl, she was on her 
own, and we knew th at she was walking arou
nd, we just saw her always alone. So, I 
don™t think that anybody was in charge of
 me, except of the women who took care 
of me at the time. But they all disappeared, fo r many reasons. Probably some of 

them died, or I don™t know, I don™t know. 
Q: And is there a reason why 
Lily  
Œ why
 Huppert
 Œ 
A: 
Bronk -- Bronka
(ph). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575

Q: No, no, no, no, th e one with 
To mmy
, what™s her name again? 
A: 
Hilde. 
Q: 
Hilde.
 Why you didn™t go with 
them? They were not Œ 
A: 
Hilde Huppert
 was in that Œ in
 Bergen-Belsen,
 and Œ but she was in different 
barrack. She didn™t know me from 
Bergen-Belsen
. S he ju st met  me Œ  
Q: Right. 
A: Œ after the train and Œ and Œ you know.
 She didn™t know me. She went Œ she saw 
me there, then she reme Œ sh
e saw me that she said, this 
is the girl who was always 
Œ 

Q: Alone. 
A: Œ on her own, alone. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But she didn't  know me from b efore. I 
don™t know how exactly this camp was, 
but they Œ I™m not sure that they will Œ th
ey wer Œ it was big enough that they didn™t 
know each other. 

Q: No, I mean when you got to 
Palestine Œ 
A: Oh. 

Q: Œ was there a reason why th ey didn™t ta
ke you there, with the family? Did that 
cross your mind at the time, how
 come they™re not taking me? 
A: No, no, because I Œ I didn™t trust Œ alt
hough I was with her, 
and although I got 
really attached to her at th
e time, but I knew already that there is no n Œ adult person 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
35
 
 
that I should trust, that I am on Œ I am 
on my  own. So , that happened befo re, that 
happened  so many times during all these years in
 Bergen-Belsen
, which people 
came and go and Œ in  my  life. So, I don™
t Œ I don™t think that I should Œ I should 
have trust anybody. Wasn™t any trust on my  
part. I knew that there Œ I Œ I have to 
take care of myself.  
Q: Were you ever adopted? 
A: I was adopted , not officially, but I was adopted  by the fami ly in 
Palestine
 and
 
Israel. 
And again, when the 
[indecipherable]
 was in a kibbutz, 
Ma™ale 
Hamisha
(ph) of
 Jeru salem, 
their mother, her name is 
B a da na
(ph) said to me, you 
know, you don™t Œ you don™t call me mo th
er. Don™t you call me
 mo ther, you had a 
mo ther, and you should  rememb er her. I don™t know, it probably  should be 
something very 
[indecipherable]
 educationally, but I do Œ I™m not sure that it was 
the right thing to  do. 
Q: Yeah, I would agree, you know. 
A: So, but th at was what Œ that was what
 Œ what she said, what happened, and I 
never called her mother. I Œ I™ve really fell in
 love with Œ she already had a Œ a year 
and a half older son than  me, and two 
weeks baby, two weeks old baby. And she 
wanted to adopt a kid from the Holocaust 
because Œ for the memory of her family, 
which been perished in the wa
r. And I didn™t feel that Œ th
at she is my mother. I Œ I 
was in love with my father
 Œ with the father, but ma
ybe they weren™t my Œ my 
parents, but the children were my  brothers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
36
 
 
Q: Were they? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, they are my brothe
rs, to this ver-very day. 

Q: So, I™ve skipped a bit in asking you a
bout that. Let™s try and get the chronology 
in the ne Œ back. Wh
en we™re back in 
Ha ifa
 and you™re in this
 camp, what happens 
to you after that? 

A: What happened was that I was there 
alone, and there was a woman who wo rks 
for 
Aliyah Tenora
(p h), which was the youth Œ and Œ 
Q: A youth organization? 

A: The youth organization, 
Aliyah Tenora
(ph). And she came, and she said, I™m 
taking you to a family wants 
to be your family. And sh
e took me. Sh
e lived in a 
kibbutz next to a kibbutz they lived, and 
she took me there. And I remember th e 
road to the Œ to Œ all the road to 
Jerusalem.
 And it was funny because not long 
after, it was the ™48 war that was there. 
And th-the Œ and it wasn™t the same road. 
And I was always thinking, was it my memory
 that Œ that I saw this hills, and this 
mountains? Which from the side, and I neve
r see them again. Bu t wh en, after the 
™67 war, when they opened
 this road again, ther
e it was, exactly wa Œ 
Q: As your memory. 
A: Œ as my memory. 
Q: So, it also sounds like another thread is
 that your memory has not tricked you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
37
 
 
A: No. 
Q: In the things that you have remembered Œ 
A: There were Œ 
Q: Œ you™ve been able to find wa
ys to confirm those me mo ries. 
A: Yes, yes, very much so. 

Q: Have there been any memories that 
you were Œ had the opposite results, where 
you thought you reme mb ered Œ 

A: No, no Œ 

Q: No? 
A: Œ everything that I remember, and I ch
ecked Œ I checked up about the holo Œ the 
Œ the hospital in 
Bergen-Belsen
, and I learned that it was a hospital. Because in the 
beginning th ey said to me there wasn™t 
any hospital, and I 
reme mb er th at my  

mother was in the hospital. And I reme
mb er Œ I reme mb er the camp. I don™t 
remember Œ I rememb er Œ I remember the Œ 
the light inside the barrack. I reme mb er 
the Œ the blankets. 

Q: Tell us, what kind of significance do thes
e memories have for you? What kind Œ 
A: Fear. 

Q: Fear? 

A: Cold. 
Q: Oh, that™s what you 
remember from 
them, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
38
 
 
A: I remember and I Œ I Œ I think that I Œ I 
Œ I™m very, very sensitiv
e to cold, to this 
very day. And I™m sure that it™s co me from 
th ere. I remember th
is wet, cold floor. 
And Œ and I reme mb er Œ yeah, 
I remember a lot of fear.  
Q: It sounds though, that your memo ries 
are Œ how sh all I put it? Because I don™t 
want to be suggestive if this is not true, 
that in some ways that your memories are 
both something you could trust Œ of all th
e things that you couldn™t trust, the 
memo ries that you had, you found out you co
uld. And that they were the avenue to 
who you are. Is that so , or Œ 
A: Probably , probably yeah. Yes, yes. Becaus
e when I got into the kibbutz, and I Œ I 
remember the first day. They
 put me with the other child
ren and we all had supper. 
And they  all looked so diffe
rent. And I didn™t speak the language. And I rememb er 
that somehow a Œ and though I was so di
fferent, I don™t remember that Œ it was 
something in that Œ in my 
present that children didn™t laugh at me. And th e first 
night Œ night, and then few nights later, they
 used to Œ to give 
me this treatment for 
the lice. And that was with this kerosene 
oil, you know, they Œ 
th ey  u s ed  to  w a sh  
your head , and then  Œ 

Q: Wrap it. 
A: Œ wrap  it up, and the horrible smell. A
nd with the Œ with the other chil Œ other 
three girls in the same room, and it was re
ally  very humiliating, night after night 
after night. And somehow, I don™t know, I di
dn™t Œ I don™t know what did I do, or 
how I fel Œ I was presented my self. But it 
wasn™t a laugh, it wasn™t a mo ckery. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
39
 
 
I always Œ I wanted very mu ch to be like th
em, of course. I wanted to be Œ I wanted 
to have dark  hair, I wanted to have freckle
s. I wanted to Œ to speak that Œ like them. 
But after a very short while I understand 
Œ I understood that I won™t be like them, 
ever. I had this straight, bl
onde hair, and a Œ a white face, and a Œ an d I reme mb er 
my self making decision. I remember like 
always lying in the bed thinking to  
myself, all right, so if I™m not Œ if I am
 different, I will be different. I will be 
different, it™s okay. And I was different. 
And I Œ I Œ I held myself differently. I 
didn™t let them Œ because I saw how there 
were other children who came, they were 
Œ they always came with the uncles and aunties and fa Œ parents to the kibbutz from 
the Holo caust. And they Œ they  Œ I saw how
 th ey related to them, and I s Œ I know 
that th-they didn™t relate to me like that, 
cause I was a Œ like my  Œ when my  brother 
said, you are the queen. So that was Œ I Œ I had Œ I Œ I make decision. I rememb er 

my self making decision. Never 
Œ never f Œ be sort of, th
e girl from there Œ from the 
Holocaust. So, I think th-that in a way, 
my  Œ my  Œ my  childhood, which was so 
depriv ed, was an engine to me growing up in different way. 

Q: Yeah. In the Œ was it in the kibbutz that
 you had this unofficial adopted  family? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay .  

A: They were there, and then e Œ it were 
my  two brothers. And th en when  I was 10, 
my  young brother was born, and they we
re very much my 
family, very much. 
Q: The father that you adored  so mu ch
, did Œ wer Œ did he
 adore you back? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
40
 
 
A: Oh yes. I was the only g-girl, he had th
ree boys. Oh yes, he adored me. And my  
mother, she was very, sort o
f, educational person. She wa
s a teacher and a Œ always 
asked psychologists wh at to do, and sh e always used to say, 
Shla mic
(ph), you 
destroying the kid. You spoili
ng th e kid. Cause he used to
 bring me tea to bed when  
I came out Œ I went on holiday . 
Shlamic
(ph) Œ and he was a Œ he was a wonderful 
man. He was self Œ 
Q: Did he feel t Œ did he feel like a father? 
A: He feeled like a father. I don™t know what a father Œ 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Œ should be, but he love
d me very mu ch, and yeah. 
Q: So, did you trust him?  
A: Ver Œ yeah, I think I trusted him.  

Q: But you didn™t trust her. 
A: I-I Œ I don™t think so . I learned I Œ ther
e were very her Œ very to ugh times for 
both of us during th e years. I think only wh
en she got really old,
 and now we are in 
a wonderful relationship. But, on her 80
th
 birthday Œ 90
th
 birthday, I Œ I talked, and I 
said that, in spite everythi
ng, she was the only mo ther I 
know Œ I knew. So, she was 
my mother and she is my mother. I don™t 
call her my mother. I don™t call her my 
mo ther, but she ki Œ she is. 

Q: Do you think she Œ do you 
think she said this in a cl
umsy way, i-in that she 
wanted to be your mother, but she also 
wanted to honor the on
e that you had lost? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
41
 
 
A: I think th at she want Œ wanted  me 
to honored my mother, my parents.  
Q: Yes. 
A: She wanted me to remember them and ho
nor them, that™s what I think. It wasn™t 
clumsy. She doesn™t do anything clumsy. 
Q: Uh-huh. By Œ by that I me
ant that, in a way, her saying it that way almost was, 
I™m not going to  be a mo ther to you, I don
™t want to do that. And every child needs 
a mo ther. So, it Œ it could be that Œ that Œ 
I guess what I™m asking is, despite such a 

statement and it Œ what it sounds like, a comp
lex ties, did you feel that she wanted 
to be your mother, even
 with not the name? 
A: I Œ I think that Œ I think that she wanted
 to  be. I don™t know if she wanted to  be 
my mother. I think that she Œ she is a 
very mo ral person. She Œ she™s a very 

beautiful person, and I think th at she wanted
 to pay respect to Œ to the family that 
perished. And I think th at Œ that I was Œ I 
think that Œ that she Œ I think that she 
wanted to  Œ I was symbolizing for he
r so meth in g  mu ch  
bigger than me.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: S-So Œ and sh e also wanted me to reme
mb er that I had a family. She didn™t want 
me to forget it. And that™s 
was her main Œ main reason Œ 
Q: That™s so diff Œ you know, that™s so 
very different than many adoptive parents. 
Many people who ad opt children don™t want
 their ado Œ their Œ their children to 
remember the former family
. They want them to beco me more integrated, and Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
42
 
 
A: So on the a Œ one Œ one 
side, she wanted me, because that Œ that™s why I don™t 
speak Po lish this day. They  never spoke Poli
sh to me. And sh e said in the beginning 
I 
[indecipherable]
 Polish Œ I spoke Polish, but ve
ry di Œ very quickly, I really 
forgot it. On the other hand, I think that 
she, because she has 
such a family duty, 
and her family is a very, very 
[indecipherable]
 very famous family in 
Israel
. And 
so Œ so the f Œ upper class of the Jewish 
families, her family is, is I think that 
together with this, she resp
ected family. She didn™t want me to forget that I had 
mo ther and father. I can understand it, I ju
st don™t know if I could accept it at the 
time, but I can understand it. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. In what way are y
our brother your real brothers? 
A: Oh, they are my brothers. They were always my brothers. Also, my mother, my 
adopted mother 
Anna
, her husband, they were very 
Œ my  mo ther is Œ was a very 
idealistic p erson. She worked for the othe
rs, she always had duties. She never was 
at home. Even fo r her own children, you 
know, it™s Œ it wasn™t any difference. And 
he was the head of Œ th e kibbutz had a Œ a 
guest house, so he was the head of the 
guest house. And on my 70
th
, we Œ we celebrated my 70
th
 birthday, what we thought 
it we Œ it is, just last O ctober, and Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 December. And my 
brother got up and he said, we Œ we didn™
t have parents, we 
only had each other. 
Said in front of her, in front of all the guests. It was a surprise fa Œ party. We only 

had each other, and I had the eldest sister. 
So yes, we were brothers. One of them 
was killed when he was 18 and a half. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
43
 
 
Q: What happened? 
A: He was in the army, was in this comma
ndo unit, and got killed.
 And so we Œ we 
left, the tw o of them and me. And we are ve
ry, very much Œ very
 much attached to 
each other. So, it was a family. Their family
, they have a very
 big fa-family. My 
mo ther Œ my  adopted  mo ther had a very Œ 
has a very big family. So there wa Œ I 
been accepted as a family, comp
letely. And they Œ and so mu
ch so that th
ey used to 
say that I look like my  father. They  were 
[indecipherable]
 oh, it show. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And why is it you th ink that they didn™t
 want you to sp eak Po lish? Do Œ were 
their Œ were their family roots from 
Poland Œ 
A: They didn™t want me to Œ they
 didn™t want me to speak Polish. 
Q: I know. Why? Wh y, do you think? 

A: Because they Œ they though
t at that time th at it™s bette
r to forget. I think that it 
was their idea of, for all the 
children that, you know, sort of start new life, and just 
erase what happened there. 

Q: Were they also from
 Poland
, or had they been in 
Palestine Œ 
A: They are in
 P o la nd,
 yeah, the ma Œ the kibbutz Œ 
the kibbutz mot Œ founders are 
all Polish. And few of them came 
Œ my  adopted mo ther, her name is 
Ba da na
(ph), 
the Œ the Œ her family had the school 
and kindergar Œ garten in Hebrew, in 
Lódz. 
So, their first language is Hebrew. And the Œ 
some of the people 
in the kibbutz, they 
were in the kindergarten  an
d in the school. This is the 
Katznelson
(ph) family which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
44
 
 
the 
Katznelson [indecipherable]
 family which was 
[indecipherable]
 very, sort of 
known family. So, they  didn™t want, becaus
e that was their idea in that time. A nd 
there were very, very  sad stories becaus
e of that. Nobody ask questions, nobody 
talked. We didn™t talk. Of course, I didn™t 
talk, because I want Œ I Œ I wanted to  be 
like the rest, wanted just st
ories that I™m tellin g. And Œ 
and also, I was Œ I am Œ I Œ 
well, I remember very early in my life th
at I was thinking th
at I probably  did 
something horrible, if that™s
 what happened to me. So, 
if I don™t have mo ther and 
father, and no Œ so, that was a thought that
 walked with me qu
ite a long Œ many 
years in my childhood.
 Then , there were Œ people used
 to come to 
look for their 
relatives, th e first years. And each time wh
en they came, I was already Œ already 
was thinking that maybe one
 day, you know, the door 
will open and my mother will 
come in, or my father. And 
for years and years I used to
 daydream and night dream 
Œ no, night dream I was dreaming about ho
rrible things and I was a Œ afraid of 
getting out of the Œ of the bed. Was quite 
awful, the night dreams. B u t during the 
day I used to daydream that 
they Œ they will come back. 
They will come for me. So 
all Œ each time when some
body came, you know, it was a new hope. But then 
Badana
(ph) said, that™s it, stop. I don™t wa
nt it any mo re. And then, when  my  Œ 
when we heard from my uncle, I think that  it was after the Œ no, it was before the 
war, before the ™48 war. He
 discovered me through 
Aliyah Tenora
(ph), thro ugh th e 
youth organization. And he st
arted to write letters, and s 
Œ and send me all kind of 
beautiful clothes, because at that time we
 all had Œ all the children had clothes from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
45
 
 
people from 
America
, from 
[indecipherable]
. Only me, I didn't h ave Œ also, I 
wouldn™t have because my adopted moth
er was a very idealistic p erson and she 
wouldn™t accept it, you know, that Œ but he
 did send me things, beautiful things. 
And also, 
Hilde Huppert
 used to come to visit me, and 
Nuta
(ph )  
Gudkowski
(ph), 
this lady with the child. She Œ they 
both used to  come to visit me. And 
Hilde
 used  
to bring me all things that she was knitte
d, cause she was a very good knitter. And I 
have a picture of myself with the knitting 
sweater that she have. And so , in this 
sense, I Œ I felt okay with the other childre
n. And then  was the ™48 war, was another 
war. So from war to war, and the Œ again, I 
think that I was on my  own. I was Œ I wa 
Œ not on my  own at that time, because Œ 
but then a Œ was the 
kindergarten teacher, 
so she was with the other children. That what my br
other meant when we were 
alone, with 
[indecipherable]
 parents. And I rememb er sitting on this truck with my  
six months old br
other on my lap, when all the othe
r mothers were sitting with their 
babies, with their children, and I was 
sitting with him. So, I was on my own. 
Q: When  did your story Œ when  did you star
t becoming interested
 in the story of 
your early years and your family? How di
d you start piecing it together? Clearly 
when  your uncle wrote, that was a big thing. 
A: I didn't relate to it. I Œ I Œ I think that
 at that time, and many years later, I really 
wanted to detach myself fro
m a Œ the whole thing. And so  I knew that I couldn™t 
deny to myself that I was there, I didn™t wa
nt to be part of it. I read books, I saw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
46
 
 
films, but always sort of dissociation of 
that, you know, not bein
g part of it, an d I 
didn't  want to talk about it. I never 
talked. I didn™t talk 
to my children.  
Q: When  did you star
t talking about it? 
A: I start talking about it when my  gran
ddaughters were at school. I have twin  
granddaughters, my  son children. And they  
did this work, you know, what they call 
root work, family. And I wrote to them. I 
wou Œ I decided that I Œ I will write to 
them. And I wrote to them, a
nd telling them sort of in a children language, that I 
was bor Œ born in  
Poland
, and I was in a camp. That was the first time that I really 
Œ 
Q: How old were you, approximately? 
A: Approximately. Approximately tho Œ th
at was about 11 years ago, I think. 
Q: So that™s very recent. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Very, very recent. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Okay. Well, that™s not unusual. Many 
people don™t want to say things, don™t Œ 
aren™t ready until their children ask, or th
eir grandchildren ask.
 And only then do 
they feel that it™s something that
 they™d like to share, you know. 
A: Yes, but with my children, to this very
 day, I don™t talk. I don™t think that they 
want to hear. I think that my  s Œ my son 
has a big problem with 
it. I think that my 
son doesn™t want to talk about it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
47
 
 
Q: Do you want to ch ange 
the tape now? Okay, let™s do that. As we™re changing the 
tape, I can ask you this; 
why do you th ink he does? 
A: I don™t know, I think that Œ that some
how I missed the train. You know, maybe I 
Œ I had to  talk about it Œ I had very specia
l relationship with my
 son. I ga Œ gave 
birth to him when  I was 18 and a half, a
nd I probably  grow Œ grew up with him. 
And I never wanted to 
[indecipherable]
 It™s okay? 
Q: I got it. 
A: I never felt Œ I never felt the right mome
nt. What am I going to tell him, how? It 
Œ no, it Œ it didn't  come . And he knew, but it was like he didn't know. I think th at a 
few years la Œ a-ago, he said one day, he sa
id, what your father 
di-did for a living? I 
said, I don™t know, I Œ I found 
out that he was a soldier, but
 no Œ no mo re than that. 
I didn™t want to Œ ev en now, wh en Œ he
 said, cause I went Œ we went to see 
[indecipherable]
 and then here, I said, well, have 
some fun, it™s Œ not everything is 
the Holo caust, you know? Immediately, he was sort of Œ 

Q: So, it Œ it Œ do you th ink that he thinks 
that you are so Œ that that™s all that goes 
on in  your mind, and th at that™s what rules you, in some ways? 
A: No, I don™t think so. I think that Œ that he
 Œ he Œ he wasn't part of me getting with 
the d Œ with the granddaugh
ters. And one day I took the Œ my  granddaughters to 
visit 
Hilde Huppert
. I took him Œ I took Œ they cam
e with their mo ther, not with 
him. He never met any of the peop
le that were connected to me. 
Q: That™s so unusual. It
 sounds so unusual.

A: Yeah, I thi Œ I Œ I don™t think Œ he ha
s a big problem about it. I think it is a 
second Œ it™s like me, I wa Œ I am first a
nd second generation b
ecause of the age, 
and he is a Œ quite a typical s
econd generation in this sense. 
Q: You™re ready? Okay, we can go
. This is a continuation of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Lily Cohen
. I™m trying to  get a Œ 
when you became active to try 
and find out bits and pieces of your story, was it 
after you talked to y-your twin s Œ grandch
ildren wanted  it, and 
then you yourself 
became proactive? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Or was it even before, but you couldn™t find out things? 
A: Not much before. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think th at I Œ I think th e first time th
at I really suddenly was talking open ly, it 
was to my friend 
Linda
 in Œ in 
Ma nh a t ta n ,
 it was this horrible restaurant, 
down town man Œ
 Ma nh a t ta n
. And I think that I was talking to her because she was 
a stranger, she wasn™t anybody 
who was connected to me. Ca
use I really didn™t talk 
about it with people. So mehow I Œ I grew up
 and I was thinking to my self, okay, I 
can do Œ do thi Œ good
 things, I Œ I think th at Œ the 
thing that I was very concerned 
about, only life that I have to be the 
best, th-the Œ the biggest, the Œ you know? I 
have to prove my se
lf all the time. 
Q: Did you? Were you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
49
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah I did. 
Q: What did you Œ 
A: I don™t know if I was always the best, but I wanted to be. 
Q: Okay . Well, what was yo
ur Œ how did you do it? What Œ in wh at ways did it 

show itself? 

A: It was some kind of, you know, comp
etition with myself, you know? Oh, and I 
was that Œ I Œ I went to the mu sic and danc
e academy, and I was looking at the girls 
who were dancing, an d I said, if she can do it, I can do it. 

Q: And you did. 
A: Yeah. That Œ but I Œ I do think that it 
was one of the things that I, since very 
early childhood I had to prove
 myself all the time. This Œ that was my feeling. I 
have to prove my self. 
Q: To yourself. 
A: To myself. But maybe to others, you know. 
Q: Yeah. What was your profession? 

A: That I™m not deprived. That I™m not
 depriv ed, in sp ite my  background 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah. Well, had things no
t turned out the way they di
d, you wouldn™t have been 
depriv ed. You would have been in a very
 comfortable family, had there been no 
war, had there been no Holocaust Œ 

A: Yes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
50
 
 
Q: Œ had there been Œ 
A: Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. 
Q: Œ you would have, you know, it was lik
e taking a child who would have had 
everything, and then  putting her on the ed
ge of extinction, you know. and ju st by 
strokes of luck, you know, were
 you sp ared death, you know? 
A: Right. 

Q: By so me people who had co me by at a crucial mo me nt. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: What was your profession? 
Did you have a profession? 
A: I™m a teacher. I am teaching 
[indeciphera ble]
. I™m a master teacher. And I am Œ 
I™m teaching 
NLP
 and like, this neuro-linguistic 
programming. I™m teaching it, and 
I™m giving courses and I also a therapis
t with neuro-linguistic programming.  
Q: Wow, that™s impressive. That™s very impre Œ 
A: So, I am a teacher.  
Q: And, did you ever go to  
Poland
, to
 Wa rsa w
, to try and find out anything? 
A: No, no. 
Q: So you Œ everything that
 you™ve tried to find out is
 from a distance, geographical 
distance? 
A: When I alla Œ when I decided,
 but I Œ but still, I Œ I know that 
[indecipherable]
 
mother and her two children went to 
Poland
 together; that was her second time. I 
didn™t go with them. I didn™t
. And the feeling, all these y ears my feeling was, if I go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
51
 
 
to 
Warsaw
, what am I going to  look fo r? I don™
t have any thread of information 
where to look, or wh at to look for. I 
can Œ I don™t have a 
address, I don™t have 
names, I don™t have any Œ anything. And it wa
s just another feeling of being sort of 
here, not being down  ther
e, rooted , just being Œ 

Q: Floating. 

A: Floating. 
Q: Floating. 
A: Floating. Which is even worse,
 it™s the worst I cou Œ I go there. 

Q: Your father, you said you found out th
at he was a military officer through the 
internet, is that how? 

A: Yeah
. Linda
 found it.  
Q: Wow. What Œ tell Œ bring me up to  date
 chronologically. After you belonged to 
this family, an-and had two wonderful Œ three Œ three bro Œ 
A: Three wonderful Œ 
Q: Œ wonderful brothers, how
 did you grow up, wh en 
did you marry, who did you 
marry? Who were your chil Œ 
A: I grew up Œ I Œ I Œ again, being differe
nt, all the children in the kibbutz had to 
learn the piano. It™s a Polish 
kibbutz, and nice Polish girl ha
ve to play the piano, of 
course. So, we played  the piano, but I wa
nted to dance. And they  brought some 
dance teachers to the kibbutz, but that wasn™t enough. So, 
Badana
(ph) said, all 
right, I will fight for you. I will get you th
is. Yet, you have to carry on with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
52
 
 
piano, because a dancer is not only with he
r legs and feet, she has to know. I said 
okay. So  I was the only kid who used to go to  
Jerusa lem
 at the age of 10 and 
studied in the conservat Œ conservatoire at 
that time. And I studied dance. And there 

Œ I always knew that I was Œ I want to be
 a dancer. I knew that I want to be a 
musician because they Œ I Œ I always wa
s very much intrigued by music, and Œ 
Q: And you had an uncl
e who was a musician  
[indecipherable]
 
A: And I had an uncle who was a musician
, that™s right. But I remember one day 
sitting in the children house in the kibbutz, 
and the Œ we had the 
radio, and the radio 
was playing 
Strauss
 waltzes, and I knew the music.
 I was very young, eight, or Œ 
and I was humming with the mu sic. And ev er
yone asked me, what di Œ wh at Œ how 

do you know this mu sic, what do you 
[indecipherable]
 from? And they don™t 
know. I knew the music.
 I knew the music.  
Q: I understa Œ 
A: Probably not from 
Bergen-Belsen. 
Q: Probably not. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Probably not. 
A: So, I Œ I always knew that there was Œ th
ere are things in me, that I have a secret. 
I don™t know wh at Œ that I have secrets. So 
Œ so, in the kibbutz, I really Œ I really got 
what I wanted. And then I started with Œ 
to work with the Œ 
with the children Œ 
children Œ children, young children. I star
ted to compose and to ch oreograph them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
53
 
 
And I grew up and I choreographed all the 
holidays. So, from very a Œ early age. 
And then I Œ I Œ I finished school early, th
at I went to the army , but Œ but I didn™t Œ 
it wasn™t for long because I 
had the rheumatic fever. And I had Œ I been released a 
bay Œ by then, I already met the man that I 
was married to, that I 
got to Œ married to. 
And he was a yon Œ yo
ung officer in the army . We got
 married, we, of course didn™t 
stay in the kibbutz. I didn™t want to stay
 in the kibbutz. I mean, I knew that I will 
never live in the kibbutz. A
nd my  mo ther used to say, 
Lily 
doesn™t like frames. She 
cannot be in a frame, she ha
s to be out of the frame. 
Q: Well, you were in a lot of frame s, 
you know. You were in a lot of closed 
enclosures Œ 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Œ for a long time. 

A: Yes, I was. So the kibbutz was Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ the one place that I had to get out of
 it, and I got Œ I got
 married, and we had 
my  son. And then Œ it was so Œ so mu ch, is
 such Œ such a l Œ a long story, because 
we got married, we didn™t ha
ve money. We lived in this
 remo te place. My husband 
was in the Œ in the official
 army , but then  he decided to  leave the army , and we 
lived in a remote place, comple
tely alone. I Œ I wer Œ raised my son. It was nothing, 
it was like a desert. Nothing, an-and we we
re completely alone. And well, this was 
Œ this alone feeling, wh ich 
was always with me, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
54
 
 
Q: Do you still have it now?
 Do you still have it now? 
A: Sometimes, yeah. Yes. 
Q: Sometimes no? 
A: No-N ow, this feeling of Œ th e only Œ I 
Œ I have it and I Œ I Œ I always have to 
remember that I have my family, I have
 gre Œ my  dre Œ granddaughters and my  
children, I mean, this is my really
, anchor. These ar
e my anchor, my 
granddaughters. 

Q: Did you Œ did you 
have another child? 
A: I have a daughter. 
Q: You have a daughter? And Œ 
A: From a di-different husband. 

Q: Uh-huh. So Œ 

A: I have a daughter and she has a little daughter. So Œ 
Q: But the tw ins are your son™s children? 
A: The twins, they™re my son™s children an d he has another daughter. So there are 

three daughters there, and one da
ughter on my  daughter™s side. 
Q: Side. I see. And so, your daughter is
 how mu ch Œ how many years younger than 

your son is? 

A: Ten 
Q: Ten. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
55
 
 
A: And my daughter, when  she went to th
e Œ that was really strange, because a Œ 
again, I didn™t talk to her about it. But 
wh en  she was around 13 or 12 age old, I Œ 
she came w ith me to 
Israel
, it was my son™s wedding, and I took her to 
Nuta
(ph)
 
Gudkowski
(ph) and 
Nuta
(ph) took her and to ld her about the camp, and she didn™t 
tell her so mu ch about me, but 
Nuta
(ph) was talking Œ yo
u know, I Œ I always 
divide the people Œ th e Holo caust survivors 
to f Œ to two. There are those who ta Œ 
were talking, and 
those who didn™t. 
Q: And how do you view those wh
o talked and those who didn™t? 
A: 
Nuta
(ph) 
Gudkowski
(ph) said that she will talk 
until the Œ the day she will close 
her eyes, she will tell Œ  tell about it. And 
many, many others didn™t talk, and many 
children Œ I think th at mo st 
of the children didn™t talk. 
Q: Do you think that one 
was better than the other? 
A: No, I don™t judge. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I don™t think that there is a judgment 
about what happened there. I know th at 
many people, when they came to 
Israel
 after the Holocaust, 
they been ask, why 
didn™t you do th is, why didn™t you do that
? And you cannot judge them. There is no 
judgment there, because you don™t Œ it™s 
so unbelievable what™s happened  there. 
You cannot grasp wh at happened  
there. So you cannot judge. 
Q: 
Lily
, what happened now, ch ronologically, so 
that we have the fu ll story, you ha 
Œ you got divorced from your first husband Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
56
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ is this what happened? And 
then you married a second husband? 
A :  Y eah -h uh . 

Q: And who was he? 

A: He was a dancer. 

Q: He was a dancer? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 dance company. We met in the Œ in the theater, we danced 
together in the theater. And 
then  he Œ it was again this long th ing. He had a Œ wh en 
my  daughter was five months old, he had th e car accident, and he was in the 

hospital. And I was with my  daughter. And 
then when  he was a 
Œ back home, after 
awhile, she Œ she had Œ she wa
s born with a hernia in th
e diaphragm, and she was in 
the hospital for two years. So
, from the age of one til the ag
e of three she was in the 
hospital. And he had to s Œ really come b
ack to his senses after this car accident. 

And I was with her, and th at again was this 
alone feeling. That I was with her all the 
time in the hospital. I was like one of th
e requisite, you know, chair. Another chair 
in the hospital. And this was ch Œ very, ve
ry familiar feeling, you
 know, that there™s 
nobody there. She was three 
times dead, clinical dead, a
nd Œ and I was there all the 
time, and that was just me. Was ma Œ my 
f Œ my war, my battle. 
Again, to fight for 
something, as if this is my
 fate, you know? Always fighti
ng. And that was Œ that hit 
me very, very strongly among all the other 
things that happened with my  daughter, 
that was one of the Œ also I remember, be
fore she was born and my  son was small, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
57
 
 
when he was just born and I was sitting Œ I was waking up in the middle of the 
night. And I know th at many mo thers always
 going to their children to see if th ey 
are breathing, but I was sitting there thi nking, where was I, this ag e? And I Œ I Œ I 

was so scared, I used to spend na Œ nights 
and nights and nights next to his bed, just 
waiting for them to Œ to come 
and take him. So that™s wh
en things came back, but I 
didn™t want to talk about 
it, cause whom I going to  tell?
 What am I going to  say?  
Q: Well, people also have to be rea
dy to hear. And sometimes they™re not. 
A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Right. 
Q: And when you feel like they™re not, then
 that™s when those questions come up. 
A: It™s true, very true. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Very true. 
Q: That™s very lonely. 

A: Yeah, very lonely.  
Q: Is your daughter more receptive? 
A: My daughter, she had a time w h en she we
nt to the university, after she spoke to 
Nuta
(ph), she came Œ we lived in
 England
 at that Œ at that time, and she had to do 
this essay about prisoners. So she wrote the 
whole essay like a script, as her being in 
a war, age of 13. And of course it ha Œ it 
was happy ev er after at the end, was happy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
58
 
 
end. Bu t she wrote this script which was 
really now, breathtaking, and she won th e 
first prize, and ev erything. And I was 
thinking, gosh, where this came from? 
Q: Yeah. Somewhere in th
e silence, it was th ere. 
A: Yeah. And her Œ her subject, on her
 B.A.
 was hidden art in Nazi 
Germany
. 
Q: Where did she go to school? 
A: In
 England
. And sh e did Œ her 
B.A.
 was in Œ in 
England
 in  
Go ldsmith
 Co lleg e. 
Q: Oh yeah. And do you live in 
England
 now? 
A: No, I live in Œ I came back to 
Israel
 after 14 years. She lives in 
England
 now. 
Q: I see, okay. 
A: But my  son did his 
PhD. 
in 
Eng l and

Lo ndo n

Q: Oh, that™s my 
alma mater,

A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: What did he Œ wh at is his

 thesis? 
A: In political Œ political science 
[indeciphera ble]
. And he™s the dean of 
NYU
 in
 
Israel. 
Proud mo th er, Jewish mo ther. 
Q: And why not? 
A: I know. 
Q: Why not, yeah. 

A: And there Œ there Œ one thing he did, he
 went Œ what was happening is that th-
they sending students for three months
 into different countries. The Œ 
NYU 
has 
branch es. So they Œ the first lot of student 
came, and some of the things they studied 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
59
 
 
was about the Holocaust, or Nazi
 Germany
 
[indeciphera ble]
. And she came to  me 
and ask me if I would like to ta
lk to them, to those students.  
Q: Your son did? 
A: Which was Œ yeah, which was really unusua
l for him. And I did. I said yes. And 
when  I came and they  stood in front of this
 very, very young guy
, used to Œ Israeli 
students are always 22 - 23, because they 
go to the army, and 
here they were 18 
years old ch ildren. I was looking at them 
and I was thinking, wh ere do I begin to 
tell the story of my  life? And I decided not to
 talk about the war, 
and not to Œ I se Œ 
I Œ I was thinking th at they can read about 
it, they can learn about it. What I chose 
to talk about was how do you 
live with this story, and 
how you grow up, and how y 
Œ how you make your life and ho
w you became a how Œ mo ther. 
Q: In wh at ways do you think it strengthene
d you, in what ways do you th ink it sup 
Œ took so mething aw ay  that you couldn™t replace? 
A: I-I think that what strengthened me wa
s th e idea that I overcomed, I Œ I won 
something, and I wa Œ survived
. I think that surviving is th
e be Œ the biggest thing in  
me. I™m a Œ  I™m a survivor. 
And wh atever happened , I knew that I can stand on my  
own feet, even now, these days. So, I Œ I Œ I 
have this strong feeling about it. I think 
that what been taken away fro
m me is my  past. I have this feeling that I don™t have 
a past. That™s why I didn™t Œ 
Q: But you Œ but you don™t know it. 
A: I don™t know it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575

Q: Yeah.  
A: Not th at long ago, I wanted Œ the Œ there are many people in 
Israel
 are a-
applying for passports 
[indecipherable]
 in different countries 
because they want to 
be part of th e commo n market. And Œ and 
my  gran ddaughters asked me to apply for 
a Polish passport because th-the
y might want to learn in 
Œ abroad. So I called this 
woman, I gave her Œ I got number. I got it 
Œ call this woman, she™s th Œ an Israeli 
speak Œ Hebrew speaking. Sh
e works for the Polish embassy
. I called her and I told 
her my name, I told her that I was born in 
Warsaw
, and th ey Œ she said, date of 
birth? I said, I don™t know. So she said, 
wait a minute. She we
nt, she looked for 
something, then she came 
back to the phone, she sa
id, you are not exist. So 
immediately I said, for the German I was very 
exist. So, this is Œ 
this is the thing; I 
don™t exist. That™s why I do Œ I didn™t want to go to 
Poland
, that™s why I don™t Œ 
maybe now, I don™t know. I have a friend in Œ in 
Eng land
. She™s Polish, she™s not 
Jewish. Polish th Œ couple, they are ma
king films. And she said to me, you know 
what? I™ll go with you to 
Poland
, to
 Warsaw. 
They really rebuilt old 
Wa rsa w
.  
Q: It™s true. 
A: So sh e said, we will go with the life, not
 with the death. We will go to the Œ to 
the cafe they will Œ they might sit on the 
way to the theater, 
to the Œ to that 
restaurant, to that restaurant that you Œ 
they used to dance th
ere. You know, this 
where we shou
ld go, on 
[indecipherable]
 to the theater. An
d I will go with you. 
Q: And does that thought intrigue you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
61
 
 
A: I Œ this Œ this I could accept, you know. I couldn™t accept that I would go to 
something which is not exist 
any mo re. And then Œ but I 
do have this feeling that 
it™s been taken away from me, 
very much so. Maybe this is
 the reaso n  that I didn™t 
want to talk to my children, b
ecause I Œ what c
ould I tell them? 
Q: My gosh. 

A: They didn™t have grandmot
hers that they could rela
te to, grandfathers. They 
didn™t have Œ they didn™t have any family 
they could relate to. The only thing th at I 
knew there, I knew th e names, and by then  I have pictures. 

Q: Are these your only pictures? 
A: No, I have some more. Some more pictures. 
Q: But probably not a lot. 

A: No. I have a Œ pictures from my Œ of my uncle in
 Paris
, and I have the pink Œ 
picture of him standing on the s-stage with 
his clarinet. And that was five min u te 
before he died. 

Q: Did he have a heart attack or something? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And there was one thread lost, yeah. 
A: I know Œ I know why he
 esc Œ why he escaped from 
Poland
, of course he 
escaped. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
62
 
 
A: But th-the main reason we escaped, I kn ow Œ this I know from him, that that one 
of the things that my mother told me, that 
he had to be in the 
Judenrite
(ph). 
Q: Mm-hm, 
Judenrat. 

A: 
Judenrat
 in the ge Œ ghetto.  
Q: Mm-hm. And he didn™t want to. 

A: So he managed to escape, and I™m
 sure that he had many friends.  
Q: Who could help him do th Œ 
did you ev er see the mo vie, ﬁ
The Pianist
?ﬂ 
A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: Did you think of him 
as you were seeing that? 
A: I was feeling Œ not only about him, I 
was think that the first scene there is 
Warsaw
 from above. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And when I saw this, I said, this is the 
Warsaw
 that I was born to. That was the 
click. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: That was the 
Warsaw
 I was born Œ 
Q: I™ve been  thinking about that as you™ve
 been speaking, you know, that there™s 
something in there that really connects. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 
63
 
 
A: That was the place. The other time Œ a
nd I was thinking about him, because he 
wrote some very well known mu sic 
[indecipherable]
. Where is my 
shtetl 
of bells, 
you know? 
Q: I don™t know the music, but 
Œ but that™s very interesting. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we 
found him on the internet.
