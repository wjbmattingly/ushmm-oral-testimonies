vis ual introduction and some im ages. Here we go. W e're 
going tof indthe country of  Lithuaniahereonthis m ap of Europe.  Lithuania, oneof  theBaltic states, 

Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. T here you seethem .  
 
 
Nesse was born Nesse Galperin in1928 inSiauliai, Lithuania, withher parentsowned a store 
that solddairy products.  T his was hom etoa vibrant Jewish comm unity of  almost 10,000 citizens.  
T here is the city.  I've already m ispronounced it, like Nesse thought I would.  
 
T here she is. This is Nesse as a young girl, already ver y cute.  You can see she's 
gotteneven cuter with age.  Apictureof  Nesse with herf am ily.  Nesse has a circle drawn. I don't
 
know if  you can see it.  This is her right here.  
 
 
Af ter the Germanarm y invaded Poland in1939, Nesse'sfam ily heard storiesabout relatives 
f rom  their relatives in Lodz, the second biggest city in Poland at thetim e, hearing that Jews were 

h o rri b l y tre
atedor killed. T hey found these rum orshardtobelieve,as Nesse will comment today.

By 1941,Germantroops invadedthe SovietUnion andoccupied the Baltic countries.  In 
Siauliai, Lithuania, Nesse and herf am ily were forcedtom ove into aghetto.  I
n 1944, the Soviet Arm y 
approached,and Nesse was deportedto Stutthof  concentration camp, near the city of  Gdansk in 
Poland. She was transferred to several camps andf inally sent on a death march in January 1945.  
On the 10th of  March,1945, she was liberated by Soviet troops.  In1950, after spendingf ive years in 
thedisplaced persons cam p in Germ any, Nesse em igrated to the United States.  
 
 
Her story is one of the m osaicof experiencesencounteredby Holocaust survivors, and today 
she'll sharethat story with us.  Please helpm e in welcom ing Nesse Godin.  
 
[Applause]
 
>> Nesse Godin: T hank you, Patricia.  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  You're very welcom e. W e'll get comf ortable and situated here.T hank you 
for joining us today, Nesse, andfor sharing your experiences with us.  Could youperhapsbegin by 
describing your experiencesas a young girl li ving in Lithuania, before the war years?  
 
>> Nesse Godin:  As you saw in the picture,m y f am ily, a norm al lif e in Lithuania. Lithuania was a 
democracy between the FirstW orldW arandthe second. TheSoviets entered in 1940.  Otherwise, 
all of  thepeople inLithuania, all the races, allthe religions living together. I asa Jewish child went to 
a Jewish day schooland played with all kinds of  children,nopro
b l em s .   
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  Can you tell us about what you rem em ber about war breaking out in your 
hometown?  
 
>> Nesse Godin: W ell, I tell you,peopledon't really realize, especially young people, m y 

grandchildren they sit and watchtelevision. 
 
Next thing, now, thenews

we didn'thave television, we

didn'thave radios.  I think that m y parents really did not want to scare me and worry m e. W ehad 
fam ily that cam ef rom Poland to Lithuania,my m other's cousins.W henthey were telling things, m
y 
father used to sendm e to the kitchen tobring him  some water.  Hedid not want me to listen and to 

know.  So I really, at the age of 13, did not know m uch about what was going on. 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  And youheard rum orsf rom  your relatives that things were
 
--
  
>> Nesse Godin:  People that came toW ashington, toW ashington,andthey told us,they told m y 
parents and all that, but I was outof  the room .  They didn't want me to know and be scared.  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  Do you remember the invasion when that happened of Siauliai, because of 
that course
 
--
 
>> Nesse Godin: T hat I remember very well, because oneday m y parents said,especially m am a, 
she says, You know, we think we have a war com ing. W eheard already news that the Nazis, the 
G
erm anm ilitary is goin g to war with the Soviet Union. W hy did they go to Lithuania?T hem ain road 
f rom Lithuania, through Lithuania to the Sovi et Union was throughSiauliai. Som y m other said, we 

have tom ake surethat we have som ef ood, som e water, we shouldrun tothe basem ent.  
 
 
W esat there two days, and nothing happened.  So we went back toour houses thinking 
ever ything would be good.  Next thing, another group cam e, Einstazgruppen,mobile killing units.  
T his is whenthe main trouble started. T hosevolunteers, they chose to com e and kill otherhuman 
beings, Lord inheaven, whatever name we call him , created. 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice: T heseEinstazgruppen groups, them obile killing units came through your 
town, m urdering Jews

>> Nesse Godin: T heEinstazgruppen groupstayed there. That special, they were assigned a 
special unit to every town.  If  you look through the museum, countus, you will see the same thing 
telling about the Einstazgruppen group.  A unit of Einstazgruppen cam eto thetown, ran through the 
city, grabbing Jewish boys andm en, allegedly, again, to clean the city.  T hey gathered the thousand 
m en, they put them  into the city jail in three locations.  
 
 
W ebelieved them .  Next thing we know, they were taken to aport called Kuziai andf orced to 
dig big holes in the ground and dressnaked,andthey were shot. How did we f indout?  My m other 
hada little store. She sold m ilk,butter, cheese.  In thosedays, we didn't havef reezers, so the 
m erchandise had to be delivered every day.  
 
 
And I remem ber thefarm ers, they discovered clothes, they cam e tothehouse. W e were lined 
up,m y two brothers,one was 18, one was 20, and me at the ageof 13. And I saw them moving 

around.  I was curious.  I cam e closer to hearwhat they had to
 
say, andthat's when I heard them  say, 
And theearth of the so
-
called grave m ovedf or m any days.  
 
 
Yes, m y f riends, this is when I learnedthat the Holocaust had com etom y town, to me.  
Bef ore, Ididn't know.  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice :  At th istim e, G
ermanforces occupied your town, and there were a lot of 
changes with the Jewish com munity at that point,obviously.  
 

>> Nesse Godin: W ell, right away, the parents were not allowed to have thebusiness.  Kids were not 
allowed to go to school.  Asa survivor, we speak to schools, we allgi ve them essage saying thatthe 
kids should counttheirblessings that they can go to school,that they live in af ree country, r egardless 
of  their look,or regardless of  who they are,and to learnf rom  ushow precious it is tohave education.

W eallhave to wear markers.  You know, I broughtm y own little vis uals here.  You may 
wonder wh y I dragged thatbag, but that'sm y off ice. 
 
[Laughter]
 
As you go through ourexhibit, you'll see thatever ywhere. T he Nazis m adepeople wear all kinds of 
m arkers,and I'm always nosey, I always wan t to know wh y did they do that. Why can't the 
prof essors, like Patricia and others,and Iask them  the question, why did they m ake us wear those 
m a rk e rs .   
 
 
And theanswer is always the Nazi
s thought of  these people as second
-
class citizens. But you 
know what
 
--
 
they puton those markers so they would know exactly where we are, so they could 
catchus and kill us. Many tim espeople say, Couldn't you just pretend not to be Jewish? T ake off t
h e 
m a rk e r.   
 
 
You know, I could have done it easily, butthe problem was the next
-
door neighbor. As you go 
through our exhibit downstairs, we have something that tells you about the neighbor.  Ihope you will 
go through andunderstand how people werenot therefor eachother, and we have to learn to be 
there for each other.  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  So at thistim e, then, you were, shortly thereaf ter,f orced into aghetto. 
 
>> Nesse Godin: W ell, it took a little bitof  time. W eheard the rum ors thatthey're going tohave a 

ghetto,and they're goi ng to put us into the ghetto.  So we were lucky in our town that ourown Jewish 
comm unity council, the council, we had 10,000 Jewish people inm y town, that they hadam eeting, 
and they decided to meet with th
e priests.  
 
 
T he priests were m arvelous people, Rom anCatholic,and we were ver y f riendly bef ore the 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

war.  T he500 years Jews lived already in Lithuania there. So whenour council cam e to the priests 
andbegged them  not to take us in, but just send them  to churches and say, T hou shall notkill 
innocent people. W eall believe in theT en Com mandments. T he priests said,W ell, we are not 
allowed to do anything without having ordersfrom  above. " Above"  meant the Vatican.  
 
 
Again, a docum ent.  I believe in 
showing docum ents so you shouldknow we don't tell stories.  
Sometimes people say Nesse is telling you a story. W eopen our heart and soul and sharewith you.  
But we alsohave docum ents to show, that what we told youexisted. A document after thewar, 
o
rders when they camef or the Jews, PastorNiem oller didn't speakup because he wasn'ta Jew.  He 
goes onand on, how he didn't speakupfor hum an beings, thenthey cam ef orhim and there was no 

one lef t to speakup.  
 
 
T hat was the biggest problem in those
 
days, that the world was silent, but we were suffering 
and being killed.  
 
>> Patricia Heberer

Rice :  At tha t tim e th en
 
--
  
>> Nesse Godin:  I'll continue.W e thought is therea way, som ething to do
 
--
 
notm e; I was a kid. I 
m eant the com munity.  They d
ecided to try to approach the SS and Gestapo, those evil people, and 
convince them that the Jews of Siauliai couldbe usef ulfor slave labor.  W e hadm any shoes and 
leatherf actories, we'll m ake bootsfor the arm y.  And they agreed. 
 
 
Now, we were not allowed to stay in our homes anym ore. W e were forcedto go intoa ghetto.  
W hat was the ghetto in m y town? T wo sections surrounded with barbed wire.  You know, m any times 

people say they relocated into the ghetto. W e didn't relocate; we wereforced to go there. But you 
neededa certif icate in m y town.  You couldn't come to the gateandsay, I want to com e in. You have

to have a passport.  How did you get that? A special comm ittee cam eto every house, and they cam e 
to our house. Again,m y two brothers, o
ne 18, one 20, m e 13, m y parents, and then came a young 
girl, she was like m aybe 17, 15 years old,that knew how to write Germ an.  
 
 
In the kitchen, we were  in the kitchen,and Iheard these evil peoplesaying to the young girl, 
W rite a certif icate f or eac
h of the boys, eachof  the parents, pointing tom eand saying, Nonefor that 
kid.  Can you im aginehow I felt? Knowing that I wouldn't be able to be with my parents? 
 
 
W hy these evil peoplewere in the bedroom, dining room , stealing what they wanted to steal?  
My m other approached this young girl.  Shegave her som e money, and she said, Save my child.  
Give her a certif icate.The girl didn't say anything.  She took them oney, and when they wa lked out of 
theapartm ent she walked out with them .  
 
 
Q u ic k ly,
 
our parents lookedat those certif icates. T here were two for m y brother, two for m y 
parents, andone blank certif icate. T he girl was smart. Shef iguredif they catch her she will say, Oh, 
it just got stuck. This girl m ade a decisionto save a hum an being.  Ever y one of  youpeople in this 
room , every decision you m ake may aff ect your lif e and som ebody else's lif e.  It may m akeit a better 
world.  
 
 
Yes, I am  alive because of this girl's decision.  That'show I could get intothe ghetto.  You 
know, m any times again I look andpeople think they could take everything in.  T hey told you just a 

little bit. W e were nine people inone room  inthe ghetto.  How m any things did we take in?W ehave 
to double up, tripleup.  I have to sleep with my brother in a be
d .  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  Can you justtell us, Nesse, whathappened to those children who didn't 
have that certif icate?  Because that'sa story sort of  in itself .

>> Nesse Godin:  It wasn't just children.  Atthat point,3,500hum anbeings, childr
en ,  e lde rly,  s ic k ,  
healthy, they were sent to a place with m assgra ves where they got killed.  Docum ented about it.  So 
the lif e in the ghetto was terrible. 
 
 
You know, there were too m any things to talkabout it,but can I just talk aboutthat one 
se le ct
ion?  
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice:  Absolutely.  The children selection.  
 
>> Nesse Godin:  Yes, we call it the childrenselection.  I was already 15
 
1/2 years old.  I had already 
a joboutside of the ghetto.  My m other paid som ebody off soI could go to do slave labor. Somebody 

said to me, Paid off to go do slave labor? W ell, thank God I wasn't in the ghetto thatday.  
 
 
T hatm orning when I cam e through the gateto go out to work, I saw trucks outsideof  the 
ghetto.T rucks covered with canvas. W e were told we cannot go to work that day.  I was running 
quickl y back tothe room thatI shared with nine people, two uncles,two aunts,m y parents, m y 
brother.  Mam aputting layers of  clothing onm e, bread inm y pockets. T he words that she said I'll 
never forget: My child, the trucks are here.  Itm ay bedeportation. Ever yone elsehas to be prepared. 
W emay be separated.  
 
 
It was such chaos in the ghetto.  Som epeople said, Let's hide in the hiding places.  Other 
people said, Rum ors are that they're going to dynam itethe area, we'll die anywa y.  
 

 
A little bit laterorders cam e, andam istake was made, go to work.  I went to work thatday.  All 
day long we wondered what are the trucks here?  Arethey bringing foodor taking som eone out?  

T hat evening,as we were com ing backfromwork, blocks andblocks away f rom  the ghetto we heard 
cries, such criesI hope nohum an beings wi ll ever hear.

W hen we came in, thefew peoplethat were lef t theretoldus exactly what happenedthatday.  
SS, Gestapo and Ukrainians ha
d joined the evil cause. W hy did they cause thisevil cause? T hey 
ran through the ghetto.  Theyf oundevery sin gle person there.  
 
 
You know, Jews were not allowed to have babies. T hey were f orced tohave abortions.  But 
wom en gave birth to little children. T hey saved them f ora year or two.  But on thatday, ever yone 
was taken.  
 
 
W omen triedtoexplain to us what happened,how it was.  T hey said,W ell,everybody had to 
leave their apartm ent. They m ade sure that nobody is in there. T hen you had to go
 
to thegate, and 
there were Nazis in black unif orm s with the point of the gun, who shall li ve and who shall die.  
 
 
A thousand innocent children to the ageof 14, 
 
500elderly and sick, and af ew hundredhealthy and strong.  You see, the Nazis f igured out
 
t h e 
healthy and the strongm ay f ightthem back, so they took them  bef ore they even m adea selection. 
T hey alwa ys f igured out how they're going to
 
--
 
nobody should interfere with their evil work.   
 
 
W edid not know thenwhere all these people were taken. 
 
Af ter thewar, we f ound out thatthis 
transf er was taken to the concentration cam p of  Auschwitz, where they were taken straight intothe 
gas chambers andtheir bodiesburned in crem atorias. T hat is called the kinder action,f rom  the 
gh e tto .  
 
 
I lo st m y 
father.  He was 47 years old.  He was killed because the Nazis thought thathe may 
f ight them  back. Af ter the children's selection, the life inthe ghettowas terrible.  No children,no 

future.

approach,and you were sent to Stutthof . 
 
>> Patricia Heberer
-
Rice: W ell, Itell you, we really didn't know wh y. W e were just told that we 
cannot stay in the
 
--
 
we didn't know any news.  Nobody toldus.  But now we know that the Soviets 
were approaching, and that's why they did it.  
 
 
T hey told us,W ell, they're goin g to close theghetto.W e shouldpack whatever we want to 
take,but whatever we can carry.  And we got to the train station. I know you cam eearly today,
 
you 
have not gone through theperm anent exhibit. W ehave oneof  those boxcars here.  Can you imagine 
100people with bags in there?  No toilets, no water, no nothing.  I don't even know how many days 
we traveled f rom  Siauliai to Auschwitz, to any places.
  
W e don't know how long it took for people.  
 
 
Stutthof was a little bitcloser.  Jews and other peoplef rom  Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia 
overf lowed the center.  You were shown on the screen where Stutthof  was.  It'spart of theBaltic Sea.  
W e arrived ther
e, they told us, Leave your bundlesbehind.  You'll com ef or it. W e never saw our 
luggage again.  
 

 
Next thing, one man with the pointof  the gun,m am a wentthis way, m y brother that way.  
T here Iam, 16 years old, standing, not knowi ng where I am, why I 
am , and all of  a sudden a woman, 

I didn't know she wasJewish or not, shepulledm eover,  Little girl, this is the good line. W hat did I 
know about the line? A good line, a bad line, I didn't know anything.  My parents never told m e 
anything.  They didn'tknow m uch.  And those wom enf rom that day on started totake care of m e.  
 
 
My group of  wom en were taken in toa very l arge room  where we were ordered to strip 
com pletely naked.  Can you im agine, 16

T hem yelling and beating us and scream ing. T hat's all I know was r unning f rom  oneend to the other 
tryin g to cover m yself.  
 
 
Next thing, we saw a sign over a door" Shower Room ."   Oh, yeah, we needed a shower.  But 
walked in, bathed, walked out t
he door.  
 
 
In 1998, I wentback to all those places. InAuschwitz in the gas cham bers was wr itten 
" Shower Room ."   People thought they were going for a shower. W e were lucky; they m usthave 

planned to have usfor slave labor.  
 
 
Out of the shower room , we stood outsidef or hours andhours, then we were given a dress, a 
pair of pants and shoes.  Next thing we were lined up andasked usaf ew questions. T hey toldus 
now no more nam e, your number.  But we we re lucky.  T hey didn't tattoo us.  In Auschwit z th
ey did.  
T hey painted a num ber on your dress. 54,015.  Ihave to remember that. W hen they called 54,015, I 
hadto say, " I'm here."   This is just to dehum anize you.  
 
 
T hen we were taken to barracks.  Every m orning we had to
 
--
 
a whistle whistled, we had 
to line 
up quickly, stand there.  T hey looked us over.  If  somebody was too old, too young, they took them  

away.  
 
 
Oneday, a Jewish lady tapped me on the side and said to me, Little girl, they'll ki ll you here.  
 
 
I said,W hy are you scaring m e?  
 
 
She said, No, I'm  trying to give you advice. Maybe if  you could get outtoa labor cam p you 
would survi ve.  Here, they'll kill you for sure.She said,Look, they line up people, wom en,they gi ve 
them  ablanket,they give them a dishf ullof food.  Sneak into 
th at lin e .  
 
 
So oneevening I saw wom en lined up, andIdid like the wom an told m e todo.  I stood onm y

tiptoes to look taller.  I pinchedm y cheeks to look healthier.  And I succeeded to leave the 
concentrationf ora labor camp.  
 
 
W hat was the labor cam p? T he house I cannot stand, the beda bundle of straw.  In the

when we started thedeath march. W hy is itcalled the deathm arches? W e gave it thatnam e. W e 
went through the towns and villages in Poland and Germ any. W esaw people standing looking 
through the windows, sm iling, noteven throwing down a little pieceof breadf orus.  
 
 
W e walked that way f rom  one place to another, som etim es they put us into another place, 
wherever to sleep. Leaving m any, m any people deadbehind.  
 
 
On thatdeathm arch Iwas beaten up severely.  Not becauseof m e.  Som ething happened in a 
barn,and in them iddle of thenight they chased us out, andthe wom en were running through the 
dark and they hit me over the head. I carry a scar onm yf ace up tothis day.

And I laid there, and I said, God, letm edie. I want todie. And those Jewish wom en pulled me 
up,Little girl, wh y are you
 
praying to die?  You have to live.  But if you live, don't letus beforgotten. 
T each the world whathatred and indiff erence and prejudice can do. And we survivors are dedicated 
our lives, not justm e,all of  us, to teach so other people wouldn't have to live through what we did.  
 
 
March 10, 1945, we were found by theSoviet Union in abarnnotf ar f rom  a little town.  In 
those days it was called Chinow.  Now it hasa differentnam e, it's called Poland.  Outof  the thousand 
wom en, we were m aybe 200.  I don't know really how m any.  
 
 
Outside, there were two big holes.  One holewas f ull of deadbodies, nakedbodies. W hywere 
they naked? The Nazi s ordered when the peopledied to undress them naked, becausethe clothing 

you can recycle.  
 
 
W ithm y eyes I saw all these nakedbodies, am ountain of them .  I really thought, Gee,I want 
to die.  In the barn I always used to say, God, letm e sleepthroughthe night.  God, let me live through 
theday.  But again,that was a time when I wanted to die, and again those wonderf ul Jewis h wom en 
rem indedm e the Nazis want you dead; youhave to live.  But don'tforget, teach the worldwhat 
happened here.  
 
 
T his is why we are sograteful tothe United States governmentfor having this wonderf ul 
institution of education, this Holocaust Museum  that will be heref orever to shout tothe worl d the 

truth,truth whathappened in thosedays.  
 
 
You know, sometimespeople try to deny it. They cannot deny it. T hey couldn'tdeny it. But

barn,and the wom en that tookus every m orning, they tookout the deadand undressed them  naked.  
T hey com e into the barn, they said,W edon'tsee the guard
s.   
 
 
Some said, Let's run to the village. W e couldn't even walk.  Som e said, Maybe they're 
standing behind thebarn.  T hey'll kill us.  All day long we were sitting there, not knowing that 
Germ ans are losing the war and theSoviets are chasing them . W e didn't know anything.  
 
 
In the evening we hear in the woodsm arching.  T he wom en say, The henchm en are back. 
T hen we hear Russian language. Som eof  us knew Russian, because they occupied some of the 
country.  And they toldus that the Germansare losing
 
the war, they are chasing them , they cannot 
sta y with  u s.  
 
 
Af ew days later,m edics wil l com eand they'r e going to help us.  And that's what happened.  
W hen them edics came, they tookus to the village, they set up a little hospitalfor us.

You couldn't pickup your little cellphoneand say, Mom , I'm com ing hom e, you know.
