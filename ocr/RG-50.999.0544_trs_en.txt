We begin
 
with this 1945 portrait of David Bayer  taken in his  hometown after liber ation.
 
On this  map of Eur ope the arr ow points  to Poland where Dav id was  bor n September
 
27, 1922. He will

On this  map of Poland, the arrow points  to the appr oximate loc ation of Kozienic e, David's  
hom etown. This is a c ontem porar y photograph of David's home in Kozienic e.
 
 
David's  br other, J os hua, is  in this  1938 photo of a Zionis t youth gr oup. He is  in the third r ow,

In 1939, German troops  invaded Poland s tarting the Sec ondWor ldWar. The next year  the 
Bayers  were forc ed to move into the Kozienic e ghetto. Here we s ee a view of the Kozienic e ghetto

In September
 
1942, the ghetto was  liquidated and its  inhabitants, inc luding mem ber s of 
David's  fam ily, were deported to the Treblinka killing c enter . The arr ow points  to Tr eblinka. David was  
taken to Pionki, an industrial c om plex that produced m unitions. In 1944 he was  deported to Aus chwitz. 
The s ec ond arr ow points to Aus c hwitz

As  the Soviet Arm y neared, David and the other pr is oners  wer e sent on a Death Marc h. 
However, David m anaged to es c ape into the fores t and was  found by the Soviets . He s pent two year s

Firs t Pers on

The lights  ar e a little br ight but we will get started. You have s o muc h to share with us  that we c an't 
pos s ibly c over it in an hour  but we'll s tart.
 
> > David Bayer :  I will talk  fast.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You talk  fast. Ok. You always  do that. So we s till won't c over it all.
 
 
It was  less  than a m onth befor e your 17th birthday when the
 
Nazis  invaded Poland on 
September
 
1, 1939. Befor e you tell us about your  life during the Holoc aus t and the war , fir s t tell us a 
little bit about your fam ily, your c omm unity, and about your s elf in Kozienice before the war began.
 
> > David Bayer :  Kozienic e in Polis h means  nothing happened to the 
goat
. Kozienic e means  nothing 
happened to the goat.We had a lot of wild goats  around our neighbor hood, and a lot of big
 
--
 
one tim e 
his  wife yelled out, "Nothing happened to the goats ." So they named the area.
 
 
My father had a s hoe factory.We had employed m aybe 25 people all the tim e. We made all 
kinds of s hoes  for  wholes ale, you know, for stor es . My father us ed to go out of the c ountry, taking 
or ders and making s hoes . 
 
 
I was  only 13, 14, 15, till 16 year s  old till the Germans  c am e in. I went to s chool, played 
s oc cer. I had fr iends . I liv ed in a nic e hous e. We had a m aid. My m other was  taking c are of the kids. I 

had two s is ters  and a brother. And my mother  and father were only in their 40s.

> > Bill Bens on:  How big was  your  extended fam ily?
 
> > David Bayer :  My father  had four m ore br others . My m other had thr ee br other s  her s elf. Maybe 100 
people. I'm the only one s urvivor . 
 
 
My m other c ome fr om a differ ent c ity. My grandfather, all peris hed in the Holoc aus t.
 
When the 
Germ ans c ame in
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J us t a couple m or e questions  befor e we tur n to the Ger mans  c om ing in.
 

 
How big was  Kozienice and the J ewis h population?
 
> > David Bayer :  Population was  8,000 J ews  and m aybe about 3,000 [Indis c er nible]. Ac ross  a beaut
iful 
c hur c h, a big, big hous e whic h is  s till ther e. I abandoned that hous e. When I c ame back , I had to pay 
bac k  taxes . I didn't want to live in Poland any way s o I give it up.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Go ahead. I'm  s or r y.
 
> > David Bayer:  When the Ger mans  c am e in, the fir st thing is  they went in to plunder . We wer e not 

hom e. We wer e in the fores t hiding bec aus e the German Ar my was  bom barding the area.We were in 
the forest hiding. We were s c ar ed.
 
 
When we c am e in, the Ger m ans alr eady oc c upied the area, we find German offic er s and 
s oldier s  in our hous e taking ever ything they c an, dis hes , table cloths, blankets
, l
eather , s hoes, we had 
our  shop in the back , warehous e with thousands  and thous ands  of pair s of s hoes. They didn't ask no 

question. They just took ever ything.
 
My m other s tar ted c r ying. 
 
 
Then a German c am e over to m y father and said to him, 
ﬁW
hy nobody likes  the J ews ?
ﬂ
  
My 
father was  a tall, big man, a beard. I was  afr aid. I was  s tanding next to him. My father  m ade a gestur e 

with the arm s . Bec aus e we don't hit back .We don't hit back . We never  hit back. This  was  our problem  
all our  lives . If we would have hit back, the J ewis h population probably would have s urvived. We didn't 
hit back .
 
 
My m other was  pr aying day and night, always  praying to God.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
David, your  m other
 
--
 
your  family owned Pas s over dis hes  that were hundreds of years  
old.
 
> > David Bayer:  They wer e antiques, from year s . Ever y year  we took  out the dis hes  for Pas s over . And 

we put them  away in a big c as e, a big ply wood box. It was  in a s helf, hidden. The Ger mans  wer e 

plunder ing and plunder ing. They pulled it down and knocked down the box. The dis hes wer e broke. My 
m other  was  c rying
, ﬁ
Why did they have to do that?
ﬂ
  
They took  the good ones  out and left the brok en 
ones . They had no shame, the
 
Germ ans. It's  c om ing to them
, e
very
thing. T
hey c am e in and took  and 
they wer e always  r ight.
 
 
Then m y m other was  s o s c ar ed that s he didn't let us  out of the hous e. But I s neaked out of the 
hous e
 e
very time to look  for food bec aus e we had no food. The Germ ans cleaned out our  potatoes , 
ever ything they took , als o.
 
So I went to a plac e where a Germ an gr oup of s oldier s  had a kitc hen. They 
were c ooking outside. They wer e s er ving them  food. I took a little bucket with me. I waited for  the 

Germ ans to give m e l
eftover s .
 
 
I onc e talked to a sc hool in Virginia. It was  a Catholic  s c hool. And I asked a pr ies t if I c ould tell 
this  stor y whic h I will jus t go on to tell you. He s aid, "Tell them  ever ything. Don't be as ham ed."
 
There were boys  s tanding there waiting for the leftover s  fr om the tr oops the s am e way I was . They 
were not J ewis h boys . They wer e Chris tian boys . They were friends  of mine
, w
ent to s c hool with m e, 
we played s oc c er together . They pointed their finger  to the Germans that I am a J ew. They s aid, 

ﬁ J uden
.ﬂ  
Som e Germ ans
 
put in my bucket. Som e c ame over and thr ow it on the ground. And thes e 
were boys  who I know s inc e c hildhood.We went to s c hool together.We played together. Their fathers  

us ed to wor k  for  m y father  in the s hop.
 
 
I asked the pries t to tell this  s tor y. He said tell them  bec aus e ever ybody have to know 
ever ything. And I asked him today the s am e ques tion. Should I talk about that?  That's  why I br ing it up.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  David, how long was it befor e they c r eated the ghetto in Kozienic e and for c ed you and 
your  fam ily into the ghetto?
 
> > David Bayer :  Took about s ix, s even m onths.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Six or seven m onths.
 

4 
 
> > David Bayer :  And we had to move out fr om our  hous e, leave ever ything, all the furniture, 
ever ything. We had nowhere to go. We 
went to one room. The J ewis h c om munity give us  a r oom . Firs t 
floor. I s lept in s omebody els e's hous e. A fr iend of m ine asked me. He had more s pac e s o I s tay on the 

floor. I s lept on the floor.
 
My gr andpar ents wer e s taying in their own
 
hous e bec aus e the hous e was  in 
the area where the J ewis h people lived. And we had to move out. 
 
 
We still had som e leather and s om e s hoes hidden in our gar den
, in
 
our c ellar. So my s is ter , 
ever y onc e in a while, got a pair  of s hoes  and got s om e s tuff and went to a far m. She put on a c ross , a 
wooden c ros s , like a Chris tian. A few times s he went, s he c am e back  with food. But one tim e s he never 
c am e back. She was  19 years  old
, a
bout two years  older than I was. She was  a beautiful gir l. And then 
the Germans c aught her s omehow. I don't k now. Maybe s om ebody s nitc hed.We will never know.
 
 
September
 
27, 1942, s hipped to Tr eblinka, all J ews . I never s aw m y s ister  after  that.Where 
was  I?  I was  wor king in an irr igation c anal s ix kilometer out of town, the Vis tula River, about 500 
people 
ther e.We were digging the c anals  for the Germ ans.
 
And then the German transfer red m e to 
am m unition factor y
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us about that, befor e you went on the irr igation ditc h while you were s till 
in the ghetto all the tim e, you us ed
 
to s neak  out, too, to get food.
 
> > David Bayer:  I went all the tim e. I was  c aught. Standing in a bak er y, trying to get bread. It was  a 

c urfew. A lot
 
--
 
the bakery didn't have muc h br ead. The Germ ans  c ame and got ever ybody from  next to 
the bakery and locked us up in the c hur c h ac ros s  from  my hous e. They took everybody. My parents  
didn't know what happened to m e. My little br other , in the m or ning he c ame out. I was  trying to m otion 
to my hous e and m y br other  s aw me. And then they find out that I was  locked up in that c hur c h.
 
 
And then the Ger m ans  took  everybody fr om  that c hurc h and took us to a c am p, us ed to be a 
m ilitary c am p in a big city in Poland. I was  loc ked up over ther e. It was  like a pris oner c am p.
 
B ut my 
s is ter c ame and br ibed a guar d and let m e out with money. She paid m oney. I went home in a hor se 
and buggy.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  David, when you were s ent to do the for c ed labor on the irr igation c anal, I think  that 

s aved your life in s ome ways .
 
> > David Bayer:  That's  why I s ur vived bec aus e I worked 
for  the Germ ans in a
 
m unition factor y. Then in 
Aus c hwitz they took m e to a c oal m ine and I wor k ed in the c oal mine to the las t minute. I was  young, 

healthy. I run away s o many tim es . I was  s tealing br ead, doing anything to s urvive.
 
 
I es caped onc e from the
 
c am p in Pionki and I got s hot in my leg. Two other  guys  got killed. I 
was  lying in the s now, the fence wher e the Germans  c aught us. I pretend I'm lying dead s o they didn't 
bother me. I was  lying with the dead people next to me. The people fr om the c am p c am e to pick  us up. 

So they r ealized I'm alive. They fixed my leg up and I went back to work in about a m onth.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to take you back a little bit. When they liquidated the ghetto, you wer e able to 
go to Pionki, as you told us , but you los t m os t of your fam ily at that tim e.
 
> > David Bayer :  Ever ybody. I have to br ing up this  after the war. After the war I c am e back  and went to 

the r ailr oad station to find out whoever  s aw m y par ents. Ther e was  a boy who was  s elling c oal. He went 

to s c hool with me. We went to s chool together.We wer e good friends . He s aw my m other and m y 
father and m y s isters and m y brother. He told m e that he waved to them and were s till ther e after the 
war. Saw my par ents on the wagon. Pus hed in a hundr ed people. There was
 
no plac e to lie down. J us t 
s tand up. A lot of people died s tanding up, standing up.
 
The Polis h boy told m e he s aw the whole thing. 
He was  s elling c oal before the war and dur ing the war  and after the war .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  whole family went to Treb
linka.
 
> > David Bayer :  Went to Tr eblink a and they gass ed them the s ame day, Septem ber
 
27, 1942. This  is  
m y bir thday.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Als o your  birthday.
 
> > David Bayer :  The s ame day as my birthday.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were s ent to Pionki. Tell us the inc ident wher e you were handed luggage whic h 

enabled you to be s ent to Pionki s o that you had som ething to c arr y. Do 
you 
r em em ber  telling m e this ? 
 

5 
 
> > David Bayer :  The Ger mans want luggage. The Germ ans  took away ev er ything fr om the people 
valuable. They al
ways  looked for  s om ething valuable. They always  thought the J ews  had a lot of 
m oney. I didn't have nothing. I had a few dollar s  but it was  nothing.
 
One day
 
--
 
I have to jum p. I don't 
r em em ber a lot of tim es.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > David Bayer :  When I was
 
going to Ausc hwitz, I had m aybe [Inaudible]. The train stopped in a 
s tation and jus t stood there without water , without anything. Ther e was  a Polis h
 
--
 
a guy who worked on 
the loc om otive. What do 
you 
c all it?  Machinis t. I took  the money and give it to hi
m.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause he gave you a little water .
 
 
So, David, you're sent to Pionki, whic h is  a
 
m unitions  factor y. You wer e made to make 
gunpowder . That was  ver y dangerous  work. Right? 
 
> > David Bayer:  Pionki was  a s avior and als o a dis as ter. The po
wder  for bullets , explos i on, made out 

of
 
--
 
c am e fr om Afric a and ever ywher e els e. So the Ger mans  made imitation
, 
m ade out of paper. So 
they built a factor y. And then all the chem ic als . They taught m e how to mix the c hem icals . And I worked 

on four  c entr ifug
es  making that powder . This  was every day c los e to death. The gas es eat us  up. A 
dr op of c hem icals  m ade a hole in your s hoes . You had to wear the wooden s hoes . And the c lothing. 
Food, they didn't give us  no butter, no m eat, jus t plain s oup every day. In the morning, just black  water , 
c alled it c offee, made up of grain, burned gr ain. That's all.
 
 
Whoever
 
--
 
never made it over  ther e. There was  one young m an from my hometown, he us ed 
to work for my father, he was  the one who was  putting the mater ial on the c onveyor . The
n 
I mixed it 
with the c hemic als. All kinds  of c hem ic als . I had to know exac tly how muc h to do. They taught me how 
to do it. If I m ade a m
istake, I would get 
punis hed.
 
 
So what happened, this  guy, the s moker, gave away his  r ation, his  br ead, for  c
igarettes . A  lot 
of times after wor k  I volunteered to c lean up the club for the Germ an s oldier s  where they wer e s moking, 

dr inking, eating. I would find c igarette butts. I would give it to him.
 
What happened, he work  s o m any 
hour s  ever y day, he fell as leep on the c onveyor  that was  up higher. They announc ed
 
--
 
they took  him  to 
the bathroom. They beat him  to death, naked. Then they announc ed they were going to hang us . 
Ever ybody s hould c ome out to the plaza and pr epare
 
--
 
ther e was  a thing alr eady ther e.
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on:  A s c affold?
 
> > David Bayer:  No. It was  like a gate
, l
ike a s oc cer  gate. They would hang us . But luckily ther e was  

two Germ ans , one was named Dr.
 
Gons zer
 
[ph]
 
and the other  was  Dr.
 
V itter .
 
[ph]
 
I never forget their 
nam es . I rem em ber. They c am e and begged the Ges tapo, the Nazis , not to kill us  bec aus e they need 

the produc tion, they need the m ac hines to keep going. Bec aus e the people would never make it. And 

luc kily they let us go.
 
The pr evious people who did m inor things, they hanged.
 
> > Bill B en
s on:  He argued you wer e s o impor tant to the production.
 
> > David Bayer :  Bec ause I was the m ost
 
--
 
I was  im portant bec aus e
 
--
 
ther e was  one Germ an, a 
young man, an engineer, he never touc hed us , never  kicked us, never  beat us . He always  was  "Hello," 

"Good
bye," "Thank  you." Bec aus e we did a terr ific  job.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Nonetheles s , you tr ied to es c ape s ever al tim es. Can you tell us  about one of your  
es c ape attem pts ? 
 
> > David Bayer :  There was  a young man
 
--
 
I c all a young m an bec aus e they wer e all younger than I 
was . He was  s ix feet tall, big eyes . He was  the one who c ollec ted the hos es  from the tankers to the 
building with the c hemicals . Ever y tim e they c ame, he was  wor king and put in the building tank s . He 
told m e I have a way to es c ape, through the forest there's underground armies , Polis h undergr ound, 
Rus s ian undergr ound, fighting the Germ ans , we c an join them . I said, ok, let's  go.We went out. 
 
We walked in the fores t, in the villages . And then we c ame to an ar ea where we s aw big posters, 
10
 
liters o
f vodka to br ing in a J ew
 a
nd 10
 
pounds  of s ugar.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  10 s ounds  of s ugar and 10
 
liters  of vodka.  
 
> > David Bayer :  To br ing them. I tur ned around. He was  working. He s aw a farm er. The far mer was  
not s o fr iendly s o he turned back. We went back
 
to the c amp to the s am e ar ea we wer e at.
 

6 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  David, I know you had other  es c ape attempts. We c ould spend our whole hour  just in 
all that happened in Pionki but I do want you to talk  about the loc omotive fire. That was  ver y impor tant 
bec aus e of what happened to you.
 
> > David Bayer :  I have a s uper vis or , a Polis h s upervis or . I s ent him  to my hom etown, to Kozienice. He 

was  a c ivilian who wor ked in the fac tor y befor e the war and during the war. So I s ent him to m y 
hom etown, to a Polis h man who us ed to wor k  for m y father . We hid a lot of s tuff with him , c lothing, my 

father's s uits, all kinds of things from our hous e, furnitur e. I ask ed him
, 
with a letter
, 
to give him  
whatever he wants . Becaus e this way the Polis h
 
--
 
he was  a s uper vis or . He c ould help you. Bec aus e I 
wanted to get out bec aus e the gas es were eating m e up. We had no m ask s .We had nothing.
 
 
So he went and he got a few things fr om the Polis h m an who was  hiding stuff. He tried to get 
m e another job. What was  the other job?  To wor k  in a loc omotive to transfer  the powder  to another 

plac e where they put it thr ough r oller s  to m ake s heets . I was  not s o experienc ed in loc om otive. It was  a 
s m all loc omotive. And s omething happened, a s park, s om ething, and a fire blow up the whole 
loc omotive. My fac e and my ar m got bur ned. I walked around like this. I c ouldn't work no m ore.
 
 
And this  was  the tim e when the Ger mans  wer e los ing the war, 1944, los ing the war . The 
Rus s ians  were advanc ing. The Germ ans  were retreating. And als o the Germans  wanted to dis
m antle 
all the mac hiner y and the factor ies.
 
After all of thes e things, the Germ ans took  us , and m e with m y 
ar m s, m y fac e, s hipped to Aus c hwitz. When I c am e to Aus c hwitz and got out of the train and the 

Germ ans s aw me with my ar ms like this  and my fac e, he c ame over  and as ked me what happened. I 
would go to the c r ematorium r ight away but ther e was  a young man, a guy who was  a pr is oner. He s aid 
if they ask  you s omething, tell them  that you'r e a c hem is t, an exper t m aking powder , explos ives . And 
that's  what I did. I told the Germ an I'm  an expert. He took  m e as ide.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told him  you were a c hemist.
 
> > David Bayer:  Yeah. In the c linic , cr eam. Took  a while and it c leared but they s ent me to a c oal 

m ine. I worked in the c oal m ine till the end of the
 
war. This was  the wor s t plac e in the wor ld. No food. 
Have to pr oduc e wagons of c oal ever y s hift. And it's im pos s ible. The tr avel alone was  10
 
kilos . I 
c ouldn't even lift it. I was  s kinny. I had no food. The s oups  they give us  and the br ead, that's all. 
Co
uldn't produc e s o m uch c oal.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The quota, you had to pr oduc e 18 wagons .
 
> > David Bayer:  Im pos sible to do it. So we c heated. Every pr is oner had a num ber, a tag. We had to 
hang it on the wagon, the num ber. So we c heated.We took off the pr evious  s hift and put our s. That's 
why the Germ ans  didn't have m uc h c oal anyway. They c alled it s abotage and hang a lot of people, too.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let's  go bac k  to Ausc hwitz for a couple of m oments.While you wer e in Ausc hwitz, you 
had s urgery done on you. Didn't you? 
 
> > David Bayer:  This  was  wher e I was  going with the c oal mine.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the c oal mine. Ok .
 
> > David Bayer :  Ac tually, it was not Aus c hwitz anymore. It was  a s ubc amp of Aus c hwitz, J aworzno. 

The mines wer e r ight ther e. Ever y m or ning when we had roll c all, we s tood up and a Gestapo man 

goes by, c hecked every one of them . I had m y glands  s well up from  the air, fr om the c oal dust, from the 
m alnutrition. So I always  trying to c over  it up. This  time this Nazi c om e over  with the s tick  an
d c hecked 
it like this. My glands  up. They took  m e out. They took me to a clinic . I didn't go to work. Took m e to the 
c linic  and oper ated on me. No anes thetic , no nothing. With the knife, c ut my throat right thr ough here. 
And this  is an experim ent. Whoever
 
get the experim ent, never  goes out alive, even when they fix you 
up. They 
s ew
 
you up and do ever ything and everything's fine but they s till s end you to the c r em atorium 
bec aus e they didn't want people alive after.
 

 
I was  lucky, ver y lucky. Why?  There was  a nur se, a m an, a young m an from my hometown, 
whic h he rec ognized m e. He was  a m edic al s tudent. They made him  a nurs e. He was  a politic al 

pr is oner .
 
What happened, he s aw me. He lived a block and a half away from  m e in Poland. He s aid
: 
T
hey are going to kil
l you
;  
they are going to kill you. He s aid
,ﬁ
I'll fix you.
ﬂ  
He made s ome kind of false 
paper that I s hould go bac k  to work . And I walked out fr om the c linic  with the Germ ans , s howed them 

m y paper, went to the bar r ack  and went to work in the c oal m ine, tied
 
up. Still a big s c ar.

> > Bill Bens on:  After we finis h, we'r e going to invite you to com e and talk  to David afterwar ds . He has  
with him the Nazi r ec or ds  of the s urgery that were found in what are known as  the
 
Inter national Trac ing 
Servic e A
r c hives  that c a
m e to the museum s ever al year s  ago. So in 2011, the rec ords  of that s urgery 
were found.
 
> > David Bayer :  The doc tor, he made a repor t, my nam e. Ther e's a copy of the original.
 
 
By the way, the German doc tor was hiding 20 year s  after the war . And in Ger many
 
s omebody 
s nitc hed on him. There was  a tr ial. And they hanged him. This  was  about 10, 15 year s  ago.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Go back to the c oal m ine. You were telling us you figur ed out a way to fool the 

Germ ans about the quota. But tell us  about the overseer , the Germ an over s eer and what happened to 
him . 
 
> > David Bayer:  I'll tell you about Ruben.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This tells  us  about Ruben.
 
> > David Bayer:  Ok . Every onc e in a while, in the m ine, they have layer s , c oal, r ock , and s om e c lay. 
And then ther e's c oal. And people who wer e hungr y, looking for food, a lot of them were halluc inating, 
going crazy. They didn't know what they wer e doing. So they wer e taking the c lay fr om  the wall and 
eating. And s om e of them died. Never  m ade it. Goes  in the stomac h. It's like c lay. Imagine eating 
s om ething.
 
 
Als o, ther e was  a Germ an s uper vis or, a Nazi with the s was tika and ever ything els e. He 
walked around with a walking stick with a c opper  handle, like a pick , pick  handle. And this  was  his  stic k . 

He went to c heck where to drill, where not to dr ill. He was our  s uper vis or in the coal mine. If he didn't 
like s omebody or maybe didn't work fas t enough, he would hit them over the head. He killed a lot of 
people.
 
 
They always  bring s omebody to r eplac e the one who die. One day a young man nam ed 
Ruben from Poland, from  Lodz, a r eligious  J ewis h boy, very religious . Why r eligious ?  Constantly 

pr aying in Hebrew. You know what the s ound is. In Englis h it's  with a P. He didn't mention the P. I 
always  s ay ps alm, with the P
, p
s alm . I s ay it r
ight this  tim e. He was  pr aying, pr aying all the time.
 
 
After one day this  Germ an killed a m an in the mine. We had a Polis h s upervis or  als o, the one 
who was putting the dynamite in. He was  yelling "Fire in the hole." He was  the one in c harge of the 

dynamite
. And this  Polish man was  a Polis h patr iot
, a
 
nic e guy. He told us one day he s aid, 
ﬁW
hen I tell 
you to move away, m ove away fr om m e. Pus h the wagon away. Try to wor k  s omewhere els e. Do it. 

Don't ask questions .
ﬂ  
 
One day this  German Nazi c ame with the stick and the Polis h m iner s already drilled, put in 
dynamite. He didn't yell nothing. No "Fir e in the hole," "Watc h out" or anything. The Germ an was  

pas s ing by and he pus hed the button and killed that Germ an. Coal fell down on him and c over ed him  
up.
 
 
Ruben, t he one who was pr aying all the time c ame over  to me. "Am I still c r azy?"  Bec aus e we 
c alled him c r azy. He was  always  pr aying. So we c alled him  c razy. He s aid, "Didn't God help us ?" 
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > David Bayer :  And from  then on till now, if s omebody as ks m e do you believe in God or  did God 
help, I always  br ing up Ruben. I don't deny. I don't adm it. I am  neutral. And that's what happened in the 
m ine.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e still wor king in the mines  in J anuar y
 
1945, when the Nazis  br ing you out of the 
co
al m ine and take you away from ther e on a forced mar c h. Tell us  what happened.
 
> > David Bayer :  The Rus s ians  were c oming c los e. The bom bar dm ent was  going on. The Ger mans  

were running like m ous e. They were s c ared to death. Som e Ger mans  even put on uniform s ,
 
c onc entration c am p unifor ms, and thr ow away their  m ilitary unifor m to s urvive bec aus e the Rus s ians  
were very fas t and s wift. They didn't fool ar ound.
 
 
So what happened, they took us out of the mines , to the c am p, ever ybody have to hook  up 
and keep m arc hing towards  Germ any.We marc hed non
-
stop, s now, c old, no food.We had to walk on 
c ountry r oads  becaus e the m ain highways  wer e tanks and Russ ians  and German s oldiers  running 

8 
 
away.
 
If you fall down, they hur t you. If you fall down, you're dead. They kill you. 
T
hey walked ar ound 
with the guns  looking for anybody falling down.
 
 
One tim e we wer e pus hed into a big bar n. Somebody ignited a c igarette or who knows  what it 
was
;  
ther e was  a fir e. A lot of people had no tim e to get out.
 
> > B ill Bens on:  David
,  
thi
s  m arc h that you wer e on
 
--
 
> > David Bayer :  Marc hed towards  Germ any.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  one of the c oldes t winter s .
 
> > David Bayer :  Very bad.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did you get food on the march?
 
> > David Bayer :  Always moving.We were alway s  m oving. If you don't m ove, you die. A lot of tim es  I 
took off the c lothes from  the dead per s on and I asked him to forgive m e. So m any tim es  it happened. 

My s hoes fall apart. I put a guy's  s hoes . Wooden s oul was n't c omfor table, ter rible. I had to wr ap ar ound 
with
 r
ags.
 
 
We went to one c am p, another camp. Finally they pus hed us  into a c am p in Germany.We 
c r os s ed the Polis h border . We wer e 
in Germ any
, i
n Blec hhammer. There were people c oming fr om all 
dir ec tions , differ ent tim e, pr is oner s a lot of Britis h s oldier s  wer e
 
ther e. All kinds  of pr is oner s . In 
Blec hham mer, it was  big war ehous es , a lot of war ehous es . So everybody broke into the war ehouses  
and got food. I went in ther e, c ouldn't get nothing anym or e, only margar ine. I piled m argar ine in m y 

pants, in my s hoes , all over  my body
, b
oxes  of margar ine.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tucked ever y where.
 
> > David Bayer:  I c ouldn't even walk anymore.
 
 
An
d then there was  bar bed wire but it was  not elec tr ic  anym or e bec aus e the power  s tations  
were knocked out. We could touc h the bar bed wire. So we digged underneath and tried to es c ape. A lot 

of them got s hot. But at that moment when I was  there, the Rus s ian s oldiers  were there, pris oner, als o 
s neaked out and we went to the for est.
 
Ruben went with us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So Ruben is  with you.
 
>>
 
David Bayer:  Sticked with m e like glue. Bec aus e I believe him, he is no c razy no m ore.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > David Bayer:  So what happened
 
--
 
all of a s udden he stopped c om plaining. Bleeding, s omething. A 
lot of bom bar dm ent. He pr obably got hit without even
 
feeling it bec aus e it was  s o c old you didn't feel 
anything. He s aid, "I c annot walk no more." So we pus hed him  in an em pty bar n, abandoned house. 
Nobody ther e. We pus hed him  in the barn and s ay s tay her e. Me and two Rus s ian pr is oner s walked in 
deep in the
 
forest. We c ouldn't walk anymor e. We lie down in the s now, under  the pine trees . We ate 
the m argar ine. The Rus sians
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you finis h. You s aid you ate the m argar ine. You told me it was  melted over  your  

whole body. 
 
> > David Bayer :  It
 
was  melted. And I was  dirty from the c oal m ine, never took a bath. And s cr atc hed 
the m argar ine from  m y body with the c oal dus t and everything els e and we ate. It was  the bes t thing.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > David Bayer :  Als o, we wer e looking for mus hroom  roots.We wer e lying in the s now. The s now 
m elted. We find s om e mushroom and then s om e bark from  the sm all tree.
 
 
It was  five to s ix days  lying ther e and no m ovement. We heard bom bar dment, s hooting, 
ever ything els e but we didn't m ove.
 
Ever y onc e in a while, I was
 
in the middle between two Rus s ians , 
and we exc hanged. 
 
 
Then we dec ided we hav e to go out, we'r e going to die her e
. 
So we walked.We c om e to a 
field. All I s aw was  s ky and s now. All of a s udden we s aw trucks  and Rus sian s oldier s  c oming. The 
Rus s ians  r ec ognized the Rus s ian s oldier . I thought they wer e Germans. I was  s c ar ed.We walked 
towar ds  them.
 
A Rus s ian s oldier  c ame and picked me up, c arr ied me, with one hand like a s ack  of 
potatoes. I weighed maybe 60
 
kilos .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You los t half your body wei

> > David Bayer :  I was  bones . He took  me into a wom an's  hous e, a Ger man wom an's  hous e with a 
daughter. They told her in Rus s ian and half German to was h m e and help me. And the Germ an woman 
did. She was  c r ying all the tim e. She was  s c ared for  her  daughter. And the daughter was  a young 
woman m aybe in her 20s . I don't know how old s he was . But she looked ver y s loppy. So I s aid, why 
doesn't s he get a bath?  The Rus s ians , the Rus s ians . They were s c ared of the Rus s ians. Ever y time 
the Rus s ians c om e to the hous e, they s aw m e, they walk away. And the wom an didn't want me to 

leave. I stayed ther e maybe 10 days . I don't remember how long. She gave m e c lothes. She c ook ed a 
lot of s oups
, m
us hr oom s oups  and other kinds of soups . I don't know. I r ec uperated a little bit and I s aid 
I have to go. She s howed me the m ain highway, how to go. And we walked to Poland.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wanted to go back  to Poland.
 
> > David Bayer:  Maybe I find s omebody. I don't k now. I went back  to Poland. It's  like a c em etery to 
m e. So I
 
m ade a 
U-
turn
. I went to Germ any, Czec hos lovakia.
 
> > Bill Bens on: While you were in Poland
 
--
 
you had left s ome of the fam ily  belongings befor e you 
went into the ghetto with s om ebody who s aid he would take c ar e of them.
 
> > David Bayer:  Take care of them
. They wanted to kill m e after that.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you c am e back  to s ee if anything was  left.
 
> > David Bayer:  I didn't take
 
--
 
one thing he s aid he gave the Polis h s upervis or a lot of stuff. So I said, 
ok . You were very nic e. You have anything
 
--
 
I have no money. I want to go s om ewher e els e. I want to 
go to Franc e, Eur ope, get out of Easter n Eur ope. So he gave me a table. A table in Poland
, w
hen I was 
a kid, this  was  a new thing
, m
ake table with m ore legs. This was  a big s ensation in our hous e bec
aus e 
we had a big hous e with a big table. So I s old it and m ade som e money.
 
 
Then I didn't want a drink . All the Polis h people were m aking a party. I don't r em em ber  the 
oc c as ion. They s aid it was  for me but I don't believe it. I realized they wanted to knock m e out and I 

s hould not s tay in Poland.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you tur ned ar ound?
 
> > David Bayer:  I dis appear ed. I went to Germ any. I went to live in Paris . I went to Holland
 a
nd 
B elgium
, a

Ger mans . When 
I went to 
 
Germ any, I didn't go for  pleas ure. I went to make money, s ell it on the blac k  market, and make money. I 

m ade a lot of m oney. I made maybe
 
$10,000
. I
n 1945, 1946, 1947
, th
is  was  a fortune. I s pent 
ever ything in Par is .
 
> > Bill B ens on
:  You would s pend alm ost two years  in Foehr enwald.
 
Eventually, though, in 1947, you 
went to Panama. What took  you to Panama? 
 
> > David Bayer:  I c ould go to the United States, eas ily. The United States I'm a r efugee, I have 

nobody, you c ould apply. But after being rec uperated, and money and everything els e, I got greedy. 
Money is a bad thing. You don't have it is  no good. You have it is  no good. Too m uc h is  no good 
neither.
 
 
So what happened, Germany was an open s oc iety. Am eric an s oldier s c om ing in who did
n't 
s uffer . The ones  who s uffered went back to the United States . The ones  with occ upation, the young 

people fr om the South, wer e in c om petition with me
, m

women, Ger man gir ls , Ger man black m ark et. Com petition. I
 
won't go to the United States. He hates  my 
guts , wants  to kill m e. I won't go there. I'll go s omewher e els e.
 
 
So Panama c ame up. A friend of m ine who went to s c hool with m e, his parents  c ame before 
the war and took  him to Panama. So they looked on the list and s aw my name. They asked m e if I 
wanted to go to Panama. I s aid, ok , good occ as ion. I go to Panama. So I went to Hollan
d and got a s hip 
to 
Cur ac ao. From  ther e I went to Colombia, Venezuela, and then Panam a. 
 
 
I didn't like Panama. Why I didn't like Panama?  Panama is a good c ountry but I didn't like the 
J ewis h people in Panama, per iod.
 
I wanted to talk  about what happened in Eur ope. I wanted to talk  
about s urviving.What do you want?  You want bus ines s ?  Here. Her e is

Be a peddler. 
Ok, ok ,
 
I'll be a peddler, I will wor k

He s aid

He was  nagging m e. This  was  1948.
 
I lis tened to him. I went to Panam a. There was  a s hip going to Pales tine. I joined the Isr aeli Ar my. 

About a year  and a half in the Isr aeli Army. I went back to Panam a. Then I lived ther e for eight years .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you c ontinue, you have to tell us about your trip fr om  Panam a to Is rael.

Wh

Gibraltar
. We had to go at night bec aus e the Br itis h wer e 
bloc kading and s ignaling to s top. The J ewis h agenc y told the c aptain keep going. He went to 
Gibr altar
. 
There was  a storm
 i
n the Mediterr anean. And what happened?  Every once in a while we had to g

fr om  the s hip to the torpedo to get the water  out.
 
 
One day, befor e 
Gr eec e
, went
 
to a plac e c alled Sparta. The s hip was  s inking.We couldn't 
s ave it. Two guys  were down there with hatc he
t

$80,000 for it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But you m ade it.
 
> > David Bayer:  I c am e to Haifa. I got off the s hip. Ther e was  a guy with a r ifle and a Naval uniform. 
He
 
looked at me. He s aid, "Oh m y God. What are you doing here?  Ar e you c razy? I went away. You 
c am e in?"  He know m e fr om the DP c amp. He was  in the Navy. He wanted to get out bec aus e he don't 

want to fight. And I joined the Isr aeli Army in Haifa. I went to
 
Fallujah.We c aught the pr es ident fr om 
Egypt and the whole Ar m y. After there a year and a half I went back  to Panama.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  you told m e, one of thos e little details , that when you wer e training

So you went bac k  to Panam a.

pas s port, nothing. I c ame in, they didn't ask  me for a pas s port, papers , anything. So I went to the 
Panamanian c ons ul

Children who were born her e and their parents are already dead
,

And I have pic tur es. Als o, I rec ognize pic tures. The Mus eum  gets a lot of pic tur es fr om people 
who don't know who the people are. The Ger m ans  killed s o m any people and
 
a lot of them bur ned. But 
they
 
c ouldn't burn ever ything. Ther e's  millions  of pi
