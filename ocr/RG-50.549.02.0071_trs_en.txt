couldn™t understand. I said, ﬁDo you -- do we 
know so mebody, do you have a family in 
America.ﬂ So my mother said
, ﬁI don™t know, I™m going to have to  check it.ﬂ And I 
always remember that I was battling for a lo

came, but I™m here.

 your head all that time.

street and pick up gold. Okay
. When you healthy, happy, 
you pick up gold, believe you 
me. It™s hard wh en you come, but you make it

A: I was very lonely, but I -- I li -- I woul
d love wherever I would go. I was free. I 
reme mb er the first time I went to a shop to  -- 
to -- to -- with my  husband to a store, I saw 
little children, I saw all the people. It was w
onderful. I couldn™t believe my eyes what I 
saw everything. You know, what™s
 -- to some people maybe th
is wa -- to me it meant -- 
every little thing was wonderful 
to me. Whatever I saw, I was happy, I was impress with 
everything. People I -- every pe
rson I met smiled to you, wa
s kind, and this was the most 
important. And tol -- you know -- I don™t kn
ow, but I think when
 we came to this 
country, we brought a lo
t of tolerance with us. 
Q: You did? 

A: Everybody, all the survivors, I think. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071

Q: Tolerance. 
A: Yeah. And kindness. Even if sa -- even
 now whens -- you know,
 this is the most 
important, to be kind. Hm? 

Q: Yeah. Were there other su
rvivors that came with you? 
A: Just -- wi -- not with me, they came a fe
w months befo re, few m
onths later, and we -- 
we stayed together for a little 
bit, because, you know, we di
dn™t have anybody. Yeah, we 
-- later we were invited to th
e -- to join the new American 
club, Jewish American cl -- 
new American club. The German people who 
came before us make the club, and they 
invited us. So we 
belong so meplace. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Were any of those other survivors from Poland, too? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: So you had somebo
dy to sp eak with. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I bet that was nice.  
A: But I -- I want to speak English. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So I ask -- I wrote it -- I wri -- see, at
 the shop I have ev erything a -- I was writing 
things on papers, even if I 
could not ask people to write for me, you know, if I like 
something from a book I wrote it down , and I was reading and studying it.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
29
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: I had everything in the k
itchen written down, thank you --  
Q: Really? 

A: I had to, I had to. 

Q: You made little sig n s for yourself? 
A: Yes, I had to. My  husband learned Englis
h quicker than I am, because he was work ing 
with people. But I did, too. I was not em
barrass, I was not -- it didn™t feel -- you know, 
nobody was condescending me. They  were liste
ning to me. So I repeat, and repeat until it 
came out right. People were very kind.  

Q: Great, yeah. 
A: The first time when I went shopping, I 
have to tell you, was a market. I was waiting 
for the guy to give me somethi
ng, so whatev er he gave it to me, I brought it back to him, 
I said, ﬁNo good, no good
,ﬂ because -- so he said, ﬁYou pi
ck up yourself.ﬂ And I couldn™t 
understand what he was telling me , so he took 
mine hand and said pi
ck, and put it, there 
is, you know, and th at™s how I learned.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And later I be -- wa -- became friends with
 very nice people, and 
I just spoke English 
to, and th at™s how I picked up. And I had an
other German girlfrie
nd from here who spoke 
beautiful English, and she said, ﬁSonia, I™m
 gonna help  you.ﬂ And that™s, you know, it 
helped me t -- every little bit helped.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
30
Q: Mm-hm. You obviously  learned, probab ly 
from your parents, to 
have an open mind, 
an d  an  op en  h eart. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Because you were not mistrustful. 

A: No, I -- I -- I™m still trustful. I give ever
ybody th e benefit of the doubt. That™s how you 
say it? Unti -- but people are nice to me, ve
ry nice to me. Knock -- knock on wood. 

Q: But considering what -- those four
 years, what you went through -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- it would not be surprising if 
you had beco me some other way. 
A: I -- some people -- I t -- I -- I -- I could 
no -- I --I don™t have the nature. I -- I don™t 
think -- I don™t know. Even  wh en I was in conc
entration camp , some people were nice to 
me. They even -- I tr -- you 
know, that I was step dancing.
 When I was in Landsberg in 
the kid™s concentration camp, I wa -- I couldn™t 
eat, I couldn™t sleep, I want to go ho -- to 
mine parents. I couldn™t -- I couldn™t. And tw
o girl -- my  mo ther has two girlfriends who 

were in concentration camp with me, too. So
 you can imagine I always run to  them for 
them to tell me something a
bout my mother. And whenever 
they were talking about it, 
they light up. They were -- 
because I -- she w as -- she w as wonderful. And -- and -- so I 
said to myself, what can I do
? My -- my -- my  mother always
 said to me, ﬁYou have to 
live. You have to live. You have to do everyt
hing to live.ﬂ So I remember I said, I don™t 
have any profession, I don™t 
know anything, no sk ill, but I 
know how to dance and sing. 
And I was singing, and s-singing to me 
-- and -- and nobody saw me, you know. And 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
31
everybody was think that I lost my mind, be
cause if they would catch me, I would get 
some beating. And that™s how it start, and 
you know, it -- it went -- 
w h en  you  sin g ,  wh en  
you happy, it -- forgot the wo rd
 -- it reflects on other people, yes? And everybody starts. 
We had -- ha -- very bad time, it
 was horrible for 
us, although -- 
Q: And you were singing -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- for people in the camp. 

A: Yeah, yeah. And other people
 are singing too, because they
 knew  how to  sing. And we 
si -- we form a little group, so every -- wh
en everyone had -- we had a little time, we 
were singing and tap dancing fo r them. Ev
en when I went to 
the holox -- Ho locaust 
reunion, were people there w
ho rememb ered those things. 
Q: Really? 
A: And I was talking to a lady, and I look at
 her, and I talk to her, and sh e told me her 
name, and I didn™t know who she was. And 
I told her my name, she kissed me and I 

kissed her back, but I didn™t -- later when sh
e said she was in the same concentration 
camp I was -- you know, it™s so many years, yo
u don™t want to -- you -- you -- you don™t 
want to rememb er all those bad things, 
but that -- it stays 
-- sticks with you. 
Q: Sure. 

A: People said and -- it will go away. It doe
sn™t go away. When it™s good, we remember. 
When our baby™s born, we re
member. When I go to the ce
metery sometimes, you know, 
because I sometimes do, put so
me flowers, I remember.

American soldier who went th

heroes, every one of them. And they were a
ll -- see, I was liberated by the Russians, but 
doesn ™t matter. But look at the Americans, 
what they done. And they suffered, believe 
me. And I wish people would give them mo re
 respect, the older people here in this 
country. They deserve it.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And the families, to o.

So  they  stop and talk to me, 
because they are our heroes
. That™s why we can sleep 
in peace at night. Nobody 
[indecipherable] us, 
nobody bothers us.  
Q: What about the other survivors that you kne
w, did you talk to them, or was -- was it 
just kind of understood that peop

A: Some -- some people are here who are surv
ivors, but they were not in concentration 
camp. They survived [indeciph erab le] other things. They su
rvive a lot, too, but some 
survivors speak about those things, I don™t want
 to say. I -- I speak about wonderful thi -- 
I speak about our children, our

ok. I was there -- a lady was there who saw --  
she looked and she saw her pi
cture when she was 17 years old, and she start sc reaming. 
And late -- the first thing when

the German soldiers beating 
somebody, and right away you know what ca

Nazis. And when  I went in, I cou -- I couldn™t 
look. I just couldn™t. It™s -- it™s -- I was a 
few times there, and

what happened? Is there a way 
to explain it, or do you -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071

can I understand those things? I would -- I w
ould never be -- I don™t know. I just don™t

what you -- what you 
would like people to know about you, or 
what you experienced, an
d -- you know, people 
could listen to this tape 50 years from
 now, or a hundred  years from now.  
A: I really don™t know what to tell you. Just 
be good, be kind. Listen to people. Don™t be 
condescending. Doesn™t matter 
if somebody did something,

64
A: Mm, very happy. 
Q: How many opportunities you™ve ha
d as a result of coming here. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And -- but there must also be some things 
about this country, direct things happening 
here that are -- don™t make you happy,
 I™m guessing. We all have criticisms. 
A: I don™t criticize, that™s true, I d on™t. But 
some things I don™t care for, but a ki -- th -- 
they changing. 

Q: Like what? 

A: But I ask -- I -- I co uldn™t say things like 
that. I know it™s a lot of help, even for the 
children to go to  camp, to he
lp them in school, which I appreciate those things, because 
this is a very -- extremely important. And for 
the older people. We have to look up to  the 
older people, doesn™t matter to 
whom. Which is true, isn™t it? 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Have more respect. 

A: Have more res -- have a lot of respect. Do
esn™t matter who it is. And with  kindness we 
can do a lot, a lot good. I coul
dn™t criticize, I -- I [indecipher
able]. I even di
dn™t think of 
it. Maybe some people would, I -- I -- I really
 -- you have to go to  wo rk, you lucky. I am 
lucky that I can do many th ings. I mean it. A
nd -- and that™s -- something I can, I sit, and 

I can do it, I can. But many things maybe it™s -- 
people criticize. I just don™t know what to 
tell you, I -- 
Q: It™s not in you nature, I think. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
65
A: It™s not in my nature. I never criticize 
my children, never. I cr
iticize myself, but not 
the children. Wh en something happen, I said lo
ok at me. I cannot do this, and I cannot -- 
but you c -- you shouldn™t
. You should tell them in a nice 
way, maybe, but not criticize.  
Q: Mm-hm, help them. 
A: Sure, it™s how you help. Maybe I rememb
er this from the time I was little, I don™t 
know. 

Q: Your parents mu st have been th at way. 

A: I was always told that I can do everything
, and that I am special. And mine kids are 
special to me, every one. If they do so mething 
wrong, I just tell them in a nice way, you 
know, you have to ch ange -- change someth
ing. But no c -- I think -- I don™t like to 
criticize anybody, and I don™t like to 
blame anybody for nothing either.  
Q: Mm-hm. Do you and your husband -- you
™ve been married quite a long time now -- 
A: Just a fe w years.

Q: Yeah. You were very young
 when you first met him. 
A: Yes, mi ne professor, too. 

Q: Your professor. 
A: Yes, taught me everything. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
66
Q: Was there a time w h en you first met him,
 or maybe some years 
later, when you both 
told each other everything that happ
ened? Do you know everything -- 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- that happened to  him, and does he know everything th at happened  -- 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Yes 

Q: You did? 

A: But we don™t talk about it. 
Q: Once, and that™s it.  
A: We talk about it, we don™t want it -- some ti mes when he speaks 
-- when he speaks and 
I™m there, I start laughing to  my self, and [ind
ecipherable] people looked at me, because 
you know, I know all the -- and he 
-- he tol -- he was in Auschwitz. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. He will tell y ou. And he was telling 
about his sister, and about his sister baby, 
and all those [indecipherable] about his 
father, but it™s so many years, you know. 
Sometimes I just remind him of -- talk about 
it. Now we are busy wi
th the children, and 
the grandchildren. 

Q: Yeah, yeah, it™s behind you. 
A: Yes. 
Q: It is behind you? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
67
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. And -- and some new -- it was so nice la
st night, we were called, a baby was born. 
It™s not mine cousin, it™s mine husband -- so
me cousin had -- her ad opted daughter, but 
you can imagine -- they  are so happy. And th
ey told me please call si -- ca-call up your 
children. So I said to my hus
band, ﬁIsn™t it wonderful to 
have a family?ﬂ Because we 
really didn™t have anybody wh en  we are ca --
 when we came here. Ver -- wu -- we were -
- we had the people we met here, from Pola
nd, from Germany, from other countries. But 
I remember when I bought this house, it™s li
ke, I ask my  husband wh at should I do? He 
said you should take candles, sa
lt, and bread. So I said, w
hy. Candles to light so you 
would always have light. Bread so you w
ould -- would never be 
hungry, but I don™t 
remember what -- why the salt. This I don™t 
even remember. I don™t remember. See, I ask  

him because I -- I didn™t know. He was a littl
e older than I am, so he knows more. But 
I™m trying to learn, still. 
Q: Given the fact that it™s so difficult for you 
to talk about those thin
gs that happened  to 
you, why did you want to do 
these interviews, and how -- yo
u did an interview with the 
Holocaust Museum -- 

A: Because it -- yes. 

Q: -- and I could see when I watched that video 
interview, the pain that you had, just even 
when  those thoughts crossed your mind. You 
don™t even have to say them, it™s clear. Well 
why -- why do you do thes
e interviews now? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071
 
 
 
68
A: I think it™s important. I think we all have to
 speak. See, I just can ™t -- I would love to 
say something, I just can™t. I -- everything is e
ngrave in mine heart, but I just can™t -- I -- I 
just can™t. I just want to tell you I saw t
oo much, too much. I hope
 nobody any place will 
see it. And sometimes this is mine testimony,
 okay, for the people who were slaughter, 
and perished. So maybe I can sp
eak -- I c -- I cannot speak fo
r them, I know I cannot. But 
maybe a few words. I just hope that the hist
ory will never repeat such self. And nobody 
will be prosecute -- prosecute fro
m any reason, for any reason.  
Q: I remember in your interview, you -- very early in the interview, you mentioned a fe -- 
a fellow named Marek Lieberman, was his name, Marek?
