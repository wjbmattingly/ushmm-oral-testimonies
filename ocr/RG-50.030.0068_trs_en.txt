Q: Would you tell me  your full name  please? 

 

A: My real name is Morris Engelson, but that's
 an anglicized version of...in Polish it would 
be Mosha Englczyn, but any how, what's in a 
name . My Hebrew name  is Moshay, and I 

come  from a  small town in the vicinity of Vilna, which is in the news now in Lithuania, 

of course. The town is called Popberezha or 
Podgrada in Yiddish. Now, the name  would 
be Pograder which would be the Lithuanian 
version of the Polish name  for Popberezha. 
 

Q: When were you born? 

 

A: I was born in mi d 1935, so I am just about 
55 years old now, and that ma de me  6 yea r s 
old in 1941 when the Germans ca me in. 
 

Q: Before the Germans came in, what do you re
me mber of your very 
early years and I guess 
when the Russians came in? 
 

A: Okay. I remember a pretty happy sort 
of carefree childhood. Alt
hough it turned out we  
were not rich. In fact we we
re quite poor for a certain reas
on that happened earlier which 
is germane to this story. But Popberezha is a 
beautiful scenic area. 
It's a resort town. 
People came there for vacations. It's well known as a vacation spot. I remember people 
talking about...oh, this famous person came and 
that person came  and so on and so forth. 
So it's a beautiful area on two rivers. With br
idges across the town or
 city as we call it. 
It's a small town. Roughly half Jewish 
and half mostly Polish people. Maybe 5,000 
people altogether, about 2,000 Jews in the area.
 And there was a small place. It was a 
very safe place. The Jewish area was sort 
of by itself but not any significant amount of 
anti-Semitism. The Jews and the Poles got
 along reasonabl y well together which is 
unusual. And I reme mbe r  it as a happy pl
ace and an enjoyabl e place with game s and 
playing and running by the river 
and all kinds of adventures 
or mi sadventures. Stuff like 
that. 
 

01:03:08 

 

Q: Tell me  about your parents. What did your father do? 

 

A: Okay. My father was in business similar to 
his father in dealing with buying grain from 
far mers and reselling it, so he
 was a grain me rchant he w
ould call it. A total of seven 
brothers and sisters that
 he had, so I am dealing here on hi
s side an extended fa mily. They 
were all ma rried. He was one of the youngest in the fa mily so we'r e dealing with an 

extended family about 50 odd people. And my mo
ther's fa mily, she had a sister there. 
That's all because they were
 quasi-recent immi grants havi ng
 been displaced during World 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
2 
 
War I and they came to this area after that  but my father's fa mily had lived there for 
ma ny, many years so my mother's fa mily was 
more scattered and the rest of her fa mily 
was in different places. In fact, one sister 
was in another place called Soly, which helped 
us out later. But my father's  fa mily come s fr
om a n old Misnagid [non-chassidik] family . 
The whole area was Misnagid because of 
the Wi lner Gaon and so forth. And my 
grandfather, Alav haShalom [may he rest 
in peace] was a very very staunch you mi ght 
say stern type individual, but a very honorab
le person who believed in doing everything 
by the book if I can say it that way. Well known 
individual who paid 
for it in a certain 
way, but the Nazis when they came in they usually picked on some body who they 

considered the leader of the community. I don'
t know why they picked
 on my grandfather 
because he was not the Rav [ra
bbi]  but we have eye witne
ss accounts that he was the one 
picked on. They beat him. They ripped his beard out, and they blinded him before they 

shot him. So that was not a good way to end your
 life at the age of 
81. But he also was a 
grain me rchant, but when I knew him he wa
s very, very, very poor because some thing 
happened 20 years prior to that that ma de hi
m poor. And that's an important story I have 
to tell you because that's what saved our life. 
It ha ppened that he used to buy and sell 
grain from the local farmers. Local far mer
s in that area were very poor. They were 

sharecroppers because the primary ownership of
 land in this fe udal society in Poland was 
from the large landowners
 a form of nobility. 
 

01:06:00 

 

 However, there was one far mer who for so
me  strange means had acquired his own land 
and acquired a little bit 
of a far m and he was considered 
rich by those standards. And my 
grandfather used to do a lot of
 business with this ma n. Oneday it seems 15 years before 
the war or some thing like that, Grandfather de
cided that the way to...to really go was to 
become  not only a me rchant but a miller because the real mo ney to be made was in 

turning the gr ain into fl our. There were three mills in our town, all water-operated mills 

on the rivers. When one mill became  available, he decide to buy it. And so he bought this 

mill and he spent everything he had...everyth
ing he could borrow to buy this mill and he 
had no money to buy grain. So he went to this 
particular farmer with whom he had dealt 
ma ny ti me s before and he ma de an agreemen
t that he would buy the grain on credit. I 
don't know what the deal was, how much extra 
he paid him, but the farmer trusted him 
and he sold him the grain on credit. And the gr
ain came in and it was put into the mill. It 
was all filled up and then according tothe story apparently it was arson but nobody 

proved anything because  the idea was the ot he
r two millers were jeal ous because they 
were afraid that he would become  too much
 of a competitor. The mill caught fire and it 
was on the Sabbath. And it was on the river and pe
ople could have put it out. They started 
to put it out, but my grandfather came out and 
he said, "There is nobody in there. No lives 

are involved. You will not put it out. It's Sabbath.ﬂ And he fo rbade them to put out this 

fi re and the mill burned to the gr ound and all th
e grain with it. So he was bankrupt and he 

owed this farmer for all the grain. Now th
e farmer  could have probably taken him to 
court or something, but I don't know what 
he could have done. In any event, my 
grandfather then walked about 20 miles or 
whatever the distance was to the farmer 's  
house, the farm and he told the farmer that he would pay him back everything no ma tter 

how long it took. And it took some thing like 10, 15 years. Everything he had, everything 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
3 
 
he could get, and there were some ...there wa
s a son in the United States who sent mo ney 
home . Everything the family went to this farmer
 to pay back for the grain. That's why the 
fa mily was poor. Now, the critical issue is 
that after the Germans came in we escaped. 
Many Jews escaped. Those who had no money th
ey usually did not survive because they 
couldn't pay anybody and people were not that
 altruistic because it was very, very 
dangerous. Those who had money t hey did not 
survive either because eventually they 
came in contact with somebody who killed them 
for their money because it was very easy 
to kill a Jew. 
 

 01:09:00 

 

 There were no penalties whatsoever. So anybody 
who wanted to kill a Jew and take their 
money, they just did it. We had no mone
y. Nobody would kill us for our money. But 
what we had is the honor of the fa mily that 
spent 15 years paying off. And this farmer's 
sons hid my father with the belief that if 
we survived they would be rewarded, and they 
knew that he meant it. So through this m
ill that burned down and my grandfather 
spending 15 years paying this farmer and his 
sons knowing that my father was the son of 

this ma n, they were willing to take the chance. So in a way he was paid for letting this 

thing burn down because he said you do not do work on Sabbath. (Long Pause)  There's a 

reason for everything.  
 

Q: Indeed. Alright. Thank you. Let us go back. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Let us go back to when the Russians came  '39. 
 
A: Okay. 

 

Q: Tell us what you reme mber. 

 

A: I reme mber that extremely well. I was 
standing by the road and my mother was 
screaming at me  to come  inside and it was th
e most fascinating sight 
that I had ever seen. 
This is a little town with dirt roads, no
t even paved, you understand. When we say roads 
it was the place where carts went, wa gons. And I had never seen more than one 

automobile per month before and here were 
these cars, tanks, armored carriers, whatever, 
going for hours and hours on end. Non-stop!  And 
I just couldn't  understand it. I didn't 
understand where these things came from. 
It was like magic, and it was just so 
fascinating to stand by the road and the dus
t and these things rumbling and making noises 
and so forth and finally she came and snat
ched me  away because she thought it was 

dangerous. It wasn't  dangerous. These peopl
e weren't doing anything. And they seemed 
to be going on for days. It wasn't . I am sure 
it was hours, but it seemed as if there were 

millions and millions of these tanks just 
non-st op continually going and going and going 

and going. And the Russians came and took over th
e place and russified it or whatever 
the right word is. They changed the admi ni
stration. A lot of people were rounded up and 
sent to Siberia, the so-called wealthy and 
the landowners and the anti-communists and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068

whoever they feared. Our life didn't change much
 because we were not rich to start with, 
as I told you the story and so forth. 
 
01:12:00 

 

 And we had a house, but that didn't make us
 into landowners. And life went on as before, 
and no significant changes of any kind except 
there was a lot of tension, the fear. You 
could sense different behaviors.
 Of course, there were storie s which I didn't  understand at 
the time  about the atrocities in Poland, in the German occupied part of Poland. There 

were refugees that were comi ng through tel
ling horrifying stories that nobody believed. I 
mean it couldn't possibly be that bad, you 
know, and so forth. But on the whole, it 
continued to be peaceful and most of what I 
reme mber of the town...in fact, about what it 
looked like and...and it's beauty and so forth I th
ink is more from that time than before '39 
because I was very young, only 4 years old in '
39. It's hard to reme mber precisely. There 
is one me mo ry that I am certain is before '39 bec a use I fell into some thing, almost got 

killed, but anyhow. It was a childhood accide
nt . But otherwise, the Russians didn't do 
anything to us, but there were
 various changes in the atmosphere which wa s more of 
World Wa r II than the Russians themselves. An
d then in 1941 in June very suddenly...it 
happened very quickly as I assume  it happe
ned everywhere. The Russians were there one 
day, and then they weren't there. There 
was hardly any fighting. There was no front. 
There was nothing. All of a sudden there were
 no Russians and there were Germans. And 
we knew they were ther e because right out from this town was a very large military 

camp, a big military base barracks where military were stationed. They lived there. They 

had barracks there. Right out side of Popbe
rezha, about couple of kilome ters. A very, 
very large camp and the soldiers used to come  into town sometimes. All of a sudden 

before that there were Poles that were ther
e. The Russians came  in and the Russians took 
over that  camp and made it into a Russian military camp. And all of a sudden, the 

Russians weren't there and the Germans were th
ere. So the Russians interlude was sort of 
a beginning and an end and sort of no mi ddle to me. Okay. 
 

Q: Tell me  about the Germans and what happened. How did life change. 

 

A: Well, the Germans ca me  and the Jews were
...two basic orders. One was a location order 
and since the Jews tended to live in a certain 
area anyhow there wasn't  really that much 
relocation. So me  people had to move  and it 
got a little bit more 
crowded, but it didn't 
crowd us all that much. They just adjusted 
the boundaries of the Jewish quarter because 
the Jews and the Poles did not intermingle 
all that much even 
though it was a combined 
Jewish-Polish town. 
 

01:15:09 

 

 The Jews lived in one area, and the Poles li
ved in another area. And so the few Jews who 
lived outside of this area were forced to co
me  in and find places with friends, relatives, 
whoever it ma y be, and it got a 
little bit more crowded. The 
other thing, of course, was 
that there we re curfews and you could not l
eave this quarter. There were boundaries but 
no real fences, no barbed wire, no real guards 
to speak of. You had to be there, and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
5 
 
penalty was harsh. If you were found outside it,
 you were shot. And they did do a lot of 
shooting of people. Terror killings. They cam
e in and just took little groups here and 
there. And no rhyme or reason. Presumably 
they were leaders or whatever, but ma ny 
people that were killed, they 
were not leaders. I don't unders
tand what the rationale was. 
Maybe just to generate enough fear that people would obey orders and not argue about it. 

And people had to wear the yellow star. You 
had to wear two stars, one front and one 
back. And if you were caught without a star, 
the penalty was death. So you had to wear 
the star to be  identified fully as a Jew.
 And you were not permitted to go outside the 
Jewish quarter. Life became  more difficult 
in terms of food and 
ma king a living because 
all the relationships and busin
ess things, and whatever the case ma y be...those could not 
exist anymore. So people lived off of accumu
lations and savings or whatever. But that 
was of no consequence because we'r e dealing with only 3 mo nths and I am sure the 

people had enough capital or whatever to 
live for 3 months. So there was no real 
transi tion to Jew(ish) 
ghetto situation.  
 

Q: How did you feel the change as a kid? 

 

A: The change was a different 
life style. It's  a tension, and it was very clear...the kids 
understood it very well. There 
were no arguments about the cu
rfews and not being able to 
go to certain places that you used to go and so
 forth. It was ve ry clear that this was 
serious. This was real. This wasn't  just parent al whim...no, you can't  go here because 

whatever the case may be. This was very clearthat the ki ds almost...it's almost like a law 

of nature. At that age you understand that you don't jump off the roof because it is 

dangerous and it isn't just that your parent is
 afraid. You really don't jump  off the roof 

because you ma y get hurt and you're old enough and smart enough to know that you don't 

want that to happen to you. It
 was almost that kind of a thing. It was not an issue of 
some body telling you. You knew you did not do these th
ings. It was almost as if it was a 
physical law. You didn't cross this barrier
 because some thing horrible would happen. 
sothere was no issue about dis...disobeying 
anybody or...or trying some  childish tricks 
about these rules. 
 

01:18:05 

 

 You stayed where you were supposed to sta
y. You wore the yellow star like you were 
supposed to wear the yellow st
ar. It was a very strange e
xperience in terms of growi ng 
up. There was a jump of years. I would think 
that norma lly a child would not acquire that 
kind of me ntal outlook till late
r. And in my case I was 6, and it happened very fast and I 
don't know exactly how the adjustme nt was ma
de , but I do recall that all of a sudden I 
had this outlook that this is norma l. This is
 how you were supposed to do and it wasn't a 
matter of somebody telling me. I believed it.
 So there was some  kind of me ntal 
adjustme nt. I had no idea how it was done.  
 

Q: You were an observant fa mily I understand 
it...Jewishly observant family. Did that...did 
the curfew affect that? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
6 
 
A: No. Our fa mily, my grandfather was extr
emely Orthodox. Mine was not that much in 
those areas. Here in the United Stat es it 
would be considered. I mean it depends. 
Everything is relative. But it wasn't  any big deal. All the Jews were observant in one form 

or another. Those who were not observant 
were what you call it ex
tremely traditional. 
But Lodz(???) and the other areas we were hardly Yiddishist related. We  had ma ny 

people there in our own fa mily too that we
re involved with Yi
ddishkeit not Jewish 
historical, but the Yiddish language and the 
Yiddish literature. Vilna, as you know, was 
the place of the YIVO, the Jewish what do 
you call it?   "Wis senschaft" Jewish knowledge 
institute, the Jewish Knowledge Institute or
 whatever the proper translation would be. 
And it was a modern type move me nt  dealing w
ith current events as opposed to historical 
Judaism, and dealing with the Yiddish language
 as a force and the Yiddish literature as a 
force. And ma ny of these people we re totally 
unobservant in the sense of holding to the 
Mitzvoth because they believed (not) in th
e Torah. But that was a way of life and it 

would be very fine for these people not to fo
llow through. So they were traditional in the 
sense of this is how a Jew lived whereas th
ose who were observant were this is how a 
Jew lived and this is how a Jew must live. It's 
a very fine distinction 
in that case. Today, 
of course, the distinctions are much greater
. So I don't think there was any impact in 
terms of the behavior of the town because that's  how Jews lived. 
 

01:21:00 

 

 And all of the stuff was internal anyway. It
 isn't as if you went across the street to a 
Polish friend and had a ham sandwi c h. So if
 you are talking about kosher food it was all 
Jewishly created in any event and the fact 
that the Germans were around us that didn't 
change anything. At least I don't recall it. I mean
 this is a very poor perspective from a 6 
year old, but that's  how I recall it. 
 

Q: How did things change?  When did things change? 

 

A: Well, things changed a couple of mo nths afte
r the Germans came  really....significantly in 
that pl aces started disappearing. I don't know ho
w else to say it. All of a sudden a certain 
place wasn't there. There were no Jews ther
e. It as if it was pulled off the ma p and 
shipped off to Mars or some thing. Some body wo
uld come  in, "I escaped. All the rest are 
gone.ﬂ "Where are they gone?"  "They're d
ead.ﬂ "Why are the dead? "   "I don't know.ﬂ 
"Did you see it?"  "I didn't  see anythi
ng. I escaped. Nobody knows anything. Can't find 
them. They'r e dead.ﬂ And it was clear that th
ey'r e dead. The question is why?   And there 
were all kinds of theories. People ascribed so
me  very specific rationale, logical reasons 
for why the Germans we re doing these things as
 opposed to just pure spite or hatred or 
some  ma ni festation of a pagan religion that 
ma de it necessary to kill all the Jews. So 
people tried to ascribe logist
ical war reasons. They wipedout this town because they 

needed for a military base and they weren't 
going to bother to relocate the Jews because 
they don't care about Jews anyhow so they ki
lled them. But they don't need our place for 
a military base. And later when we, my mother and father, escaped to Belarussia 

(Belarus), the whole rationale was they'r e kill
ing all the Jews here but the Belarussia is 
alright because that's  across the border. So 
places started to disa
ppear and because the 
they were places of like kind in terms of bor
ders and location and other things, there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
7 
 
a general feeling we too were on the list. Th
e question is what do you do about it. And we 
couldn't do anything about it. So there's a great 
deal of uncertainty, agreat deal of fear, a 
great deal of wondering what would happen a
nd that people were very jittery. It's like 
living in San Francisco after the earthqua
ke recently and wondering what...when the 
aftershocks going to hit. Do you run?  Do 
you stay?   Do you come  home ?   Are the walls 
going to crumble down? 
 

01:24:00 

 

 Except you couldn't go any place. There wa
s no place to go. People wonder why they 
didn't escape or anythi ng like that. There wa
s no place to escape. There wa s absolutely no 

place to go. Those people who escaped...there were some  who ma naged to escape as the 

Germans came in. They escaped in front of the Germans and they went into Russia. They 

escaped with the Russian army. Those people 
really had some place to go. They had the 
foresight and they went. But anybody who stayed, 
the front was so far 
behind us or rather 
front of us, which ever way and the German
s we re practically in Moscow. There was no 
place to escape. So the change was more of th
e same kind in terms of a general feeling of 
I won't say fear. Uncertainty and dread. I th
ink dr ead is a better word than fear. Not 
knowing.  
 

Q: Whathappened? 

 

A: What happened is that in September of 
1941 on the Friday before Sabbath Shuva  which 
was on the 20th of September Germa n groups
...soldiers came and organized various local 
me n villages, primarily civilian. There ma y ha
ve been some  Poles in those groups but I 
am not aware of any, and it is my understandi
ng it was one of the Einsatzgruppen came  to 
finish off Popberezha. There were ab
out 2,000 Jews in Popberezha and surrounding 
vicinity there were little towns or farm co
mmunit i es or whatever and just lived all over 
the place. It happened that one of the lo
cal police functionaries was friendly with a 
certain Jews because of some  prior favors th
at they had done to each ot her. And he knew 
that these people came in and they were 
organizing various things. He didn't know 

precisely why but it was quite obvious. And so 
he came to his Jewish friend and he said, 
"Something is going to ha ppen. You have hours be fore the place will be  surrounded and 

nobody will be able to get out.ﬂ This ma n se
nt out the alarm. Most people (a) didn't 
believe it and (b) had no idea 
what to do anyhow. They were
n't going to leave children. 
They weren't going to leave parent s, and they
 had no place to go and they said, "If I am 
going to die, I mi ght as well die right here.ﬂ 
Many people such as my father believed it 
more or less but they wouldn't go because in pr ior times there had been false alarms and 

there was a great deal of l
ooting and people were afraid 
of losing their few possessions 
because really you were not going to have a chan
ce to work or  do anythi ng useful to ga in 
more possessions. 
 

01:27:00 

 

 But there was some  work I should say. The Germa ns put the Jews to work in slave labor 
and it was very hard work. In fact, my father
 worked at slave labor and he fell down. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
8 
 
wasn't  deliberate. He fell off a...a scaffoldi
ng or some thing and he broke two of his ribs. 
So at that time  he had taped up ribs a
nd...and that was the situation. But anyhow my 
father decided to send my mother, brother 
and myself out. We...we agreed where they 
would go and he said he knew the area very
 well. He was a strong ma n. He was a very, 
very strong physically,  my fath
er in spite of his broken rib, 
and he felt confident that he 
could get out no ma tter what they did because he knew the area extremely well and he  
would be able to hide and sneak through. He sa
id, "I am going to stay home  and if there's 

looting I'll stop them. If s o me thing is happe
ning I'll come  meet you there next day.ﬂ So 
we packed up some  food. It was the Sabba
th food, some  chicken I reme mber and a few 
other things in a bundle, dressed up as peas
ant woma n and took off the yellow stars and 
we walked right out of town. Nobody stoppe
d us. There were no guards. There was no 
nothing. The problem wa s we had to walk right 
by the military barracks. And that scared 
us because we were sure that these people 
would do some thing. But they didn't. They had 
nothing to do with it. Those were ordinary
 soldiers. The Einsatzgruppen group were the 
SS, and the soldiers were soldiers, and we 
were just peasants walking by. We  walked 
right by the barracks a couple of 
mi l e s out of town where there'
s a little road to the side 
where all these Germans...the soldiers were staying, and we saw them comi ng and going 

and we just kept walking. And it was nothi
ng. And so we kept walking. And we had a 
couple of hours walk to get out of town to 
a certain farm of a woma n that our family 
knew, had done some  business with her. Fine
 lady presumably. She was a widow, had a 
teenage son. I would guess 15, 16 years old. An
d we came  there and she was at home  and 
mother told her some thing is happening a
nd we need to hide. The woma n was very 
fearful. She didn't want us there, but she 
couldn't turn us away. So she said, "Okay. I 
won't let you in the house. I am afraid. Go stay
 in the barn.ﬂ There was a barn, and there 
was hay in the barn, and we crawled up in th
e loft and the hay, and the barn walls were 
not wood. They were kind of straw and we c
ould see through the chinks in the ma tted 
straw. And during the night we started heari
ng shooting. So it was bad. It was clear that 

some thing was really going on. It wa s a lot of
 shooting. And father was supposed to come  
during the night if some thing would happen. He 
didn't come . And so we were sure that he 
couldn't get out. That was the end of him.  
 

01:30:00 

 

 In the morning we didn't know what to do. But before we could do some thing, a 
Lithuanian local auxiliary came to the house a
nd he wanted to know if any Jews were in 
the area and the woma n, "I haven't...I don't 
know anything about Jews. No Jews in my 
house. If you want, come in and look.ﬂ And he
 says, "There are other areas. What about 
your barn?   Jews have sneaked into the barn.ﬂ
 She said, "Silly, what would Jews be doing 
in a barn?"  "Listen, you have been working 
very hard," she says, "it's been a horrible 
day. They'r e working all night chasing these te
rrible Jews. Come  in and have some thing 

to eat and you can chase some  more Jews.ﬂ He 
says, "Okay," so they went into the house. 
And she gave him breakfast. I don't know what. He was eating breakfast and her teenage 

son came into the barn and we heard this and 
this was very close so we could hear them 
talking. We  saw him with a gun, 
a bolt action rifle. I reme mb er it. You had to pull the 
bolt, an old type rifle. And the son came  in
 and he said, "I'm going to get you across the 
river. Come  quickly.ﬂ Now Popberezha is on tw
o rivers as I said. One is a ma jor river 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068

called the Lyna [this rive r is far west  from
 Vilnius!] which you will find in all the bi g 
maps I think. It was the Lyna that was going 
over there or it could 
have been the other 
one. I can't  swear to it. Anyhow he came with
 a boat. We  got into the boat and he was 
rowing us across the river and we were about 
two-thirds across and for whatever reason 
this person saw us through the window. He got
 up, he stretched or whatever. He saw us 
through the window. He  dropped his where the .......?
?   is gone. He ran out and he pointed 
his gun at this young ma n and he started shoutin
g for him to c o me  back or he would kill 
him but this fellow continued to row for about
 another half a mi nute.
 We  were close. If 
we were not close, I don't know what would ha
ve happened. He continued to row. We got 
to this shore. We  jumped out and then this 
fellow, I think, he shot one shot or some thing 
like that. This guy turned ar
ound and he came back. He came back. He got him in the 
boat and rowed him across so the Lithuanian 
rode across and he was about 5, 7 mi nutes 
behind us. He got out of the boat and we we
re near the woods. There were some  woods 
there. And he starting shooting at us. And we
 just kept going into the woods and he was 
right behind us. And I don't know how he mi sse
d us, but he mi ssed us. Now we couldn't 
go very fast because we were in the woods a
nd there were trees and there were branches 
ripping us up, you know, and I was not running t
oo fast. I'm a little kid. And we were not 
woods me n people. We 'r e towns people. So we
 kept running in the woods and he was 

behind us shooting at us all the time . And this
 woma n was sure that we were dead. I mean 
it's impossible that we would escape. And 
she never saw him again. He just went 
wherever he went. And she never saw us. 
 

01:33:00 

 

 She didn't go into the woods to look obviously. Anyhow, he  didn't kill us. So we were in 
these woods and we'r e running in the wood and 
finally, we knew we lost him. But we're 
lost in the woods. We  don't know where to go 
or anything. Just lost
 in the woods. And 
we'r e wonde ring around the woods in circle
s or whatever...just going in the woods. 
Finally, we're up on a hill or some thing and in the distance we  saw the spire of a church. 

Very tall. So we needed a di
rection to go. Now a  very strang
e thing. Many of the priests 
in that  area  were illiterate priest s. They 
were peasants themselves, and they were very 
anti-Semitic. I have to say this. They were il
literate and they be lieve d the Je ws killed 
God. The Jews crucified Jesus and they preached it. And not as badly in other places but 

they preached it and there were plenty of
 anti-Semites. The towns people themselves 
were not bad. Strange deal. This church that 
we saw, this priest was not only not anti-
Se mitic, he was, you mi ght call, philo-semitic. He
 really believed that the Jews were a 
good people and that it was his christian duty to
 protect the Jews. He was very friendly 
with the Jews. And we got to this church
 and a woma n ca me out
...the housekeeper or 
whatever. She says, "I'm sorry. The priest is 
not he re. They'r e killing the Je ws in town 

and he went to see if he could help. But he le
ft word if any Jew ma naged to come  to this 
area I am to do certain things for you. Here is 
some  food.ﬂ And what she gave us is mi lk, 
some thing to drink. "And I will lead you to wh
ere you can escape.ﬂ And she sent us off to 
a farm. She told us where to go. And we had not
 known about this thing at all. It was an 
old smuggling network. The area is on the bor
der between Poland and Lithuania and it 
changed hands ma ny ti mes and the people in th
is area, they didn't feel the border was 
real. I mean someti mes it's Poland, someti mes Lithuania. Who cares about customs. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068

There was a whole bunch of people, a gang or
 whatever you call it who were smugglers. 
And the commodities they used to smuggle wa ssaccharin (it) was a ve ry big commodity 
because it's small, and it was very precious. Substitute for sugar because sugar was very 

hard to get. And cigarettes. That was thei
r big thing. Saccharin and cigarettes. Anyhow, 
so she got in touch with
 this gang of smugglers. 
 

01:36:00 

 

 Now they were not altruistic and they 
were not anti-Jewish. They enjoyed crossing 
borders and taking risks if they
 got paid. So whatever money Mother had she paid up, and 
we went from hand to hand to hand to hand...a 
2 week walk at night and they would hand 

us off to the next station of this smuggli
ng network. And on the road on the way lots of 
other Jews got involved in this. Pre
tty soon there was anything...20, 30 people, 
some ti me s comi ng and going, each one looking to 
get to a certain place. And we were 
looking to get to Colsol in Belarus where moth
er had a sister and sh
e figured that's where 
she could go where she knew some body. So he told them wher e she wanted to go and 

they said, "Yeah. We 'll move you on this way. 
And this people were going to move you 
that way.ﬂ Was a whole network of these 
people. And along the way, each one you gave 
a little bit of money. As l
ong as your money held out you 
were alright. They gave you 
food. During the day we were hiding and at ni
ght we were walking through fields, across 

barbed wire fences and all kinds of stuff a
nd it was pitch dark and they knew all the holes 
and all the ditches and they 
would say, "Stop here. There's going to be a big ditch. Hold 

hands cause you'll fall down.ﬂ And we would 
hold on and walk across. And we walked 
for 2 weeks. And pretty soon we were on the out
skirts of this place and they said, "That's 
it. Our job stops here. You're on your own. Do
 whatever you like.ﬂ And all of a sudden 
they weren't there. And so we were down 
to nothing. My mot her had two wedding rings. 
She had her own wedding ring and her father's
 wedding ring with her. Everything else 
was given away to these people, and we had to
 get to this place. 
And it was far away and 
also dangerous. And there was 
a farmer with a wagon driving by so she came  to hi m a nd 
she asked him if he would drive us to this
 ghetto if he knew wher
e it was. He said, 
"Sure.ﬂ "Would you drive us? "   He said, "Yea
h. Pay me .ﬂ So she decided she would pay 
him with her own wedding ring and hold father
's because this was a me mento. She was 
sure father was dead. So she gave him her 
wedding ring and he dr
ove us right to the 
ghetto. Wa s no problem. In the ghetto we came ri
ght in and I have to say this because 
there's feeling I have. I am 
unhappy with certain historians 
and other analysts who claim 
that the leaders of the ghettos and the Jewish
 police were all nasty and hoodlums. Clearly, 

there were some  nasty people there as a
nybody who rises to power and in the ma jor 
ghettos there were some  tyrant s. But all my e
xperiences this one and others as I'll tell 
you, these people did an exemplary, selfless j
ob in extremely different circumstances. 
 

01:39:00 

 

 We ca me  to the ghetto. They didn't know us. They didn't owe us. They took us in. They 
created papers for us as if we were member
s of the ghetto so we could live there. They 
shared their food. They shared what they
 had. We  became me mbers of the ghetto. We  
were fellow Jews. They took us in. There're ot
her incidences when we escaped from this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068

ghetto where we had to go some  place. The sa
me deal. In my experience, this is a  
baseless

Q: Okay. We  are back on came ra, and they ar
e bringing you to where your father is. Can you 
describe that reunion? 
 

A: That was an emotional reunion. I have to 
say. I really don't reme mber that much. There 
was a lot of hugging and holding and Father hadn
't  slept for 2 days, of course. He was 
just walking around, pacing. He was a nervous 
wr eck, but as soon as
 we saw him, he 
said, "I knew everything woul
d be alright because I saw the snow.ﬂ When he saw the 
snow he knew everything was alright. And th
en 2 months later, this was in December 
1942. 
 

02:01:30 

 

Q: Before you go to 2 mont hs later. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Where were you brought?   Where was your father? 
 
A: My fa ther was in this place, the fa rm wh
ere these people lived. And arrangements were 
ma de that we would stay there too but we w
ould hide in a barn. We  did not stay there 
very, very long it turned out. 
 

02:02:00 

 

 Some body saw us or ma ybe they didn't  see 
us, but there was a suspicion that some body 
saw us, and there was a great fear. But I 
think some body did see us because there was 
some  searches going on. There was a great fear 
that we were betrayed and we would be 
caught. So we had to escape and there was no place else to go, and this wa s not 2 mo nths 

later but about 4 months later. It was alrea
dy towa rd the spring, toward the mi ddle March, 
April of 43. 
 

Q: And you had been hiding how in the barn? 

 

A: It was sort of a barn and we kinda lived
 there. That was not a big thing. There was 
another barn later which was a major thing to 
me . This barn wa s transitory and I really 
don't have any great recollection because 
we moved around. Some times  we'r e here, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
12 
 
someti mes we'r e there. Sometimes we were
 in the house behind the oven. There was a 
little, kind of cubicle except
 that it was very hot. 
 
02:03:00 

 

 It was a big brick oven that also was used
 to heating the house and it was very hot, but 
when we we re presumably betrayed by some
one we had to escape from the house. And 
we went into the field. A lot of it was potat
o country, and when they harvested potatoes 

they stored them in holes under ground in the 
field. They would dig a big hole and that's  
where the potatoes were kept because  of cold ai
r and so forth. We ll, we hid in a little hole 
underneath the potatoe s in the big hole, which was a very unpleasant place because there 

were all kinds of wor ms  and things and animal
s in there. It was just a big hole in the 
ground and potato bugs and whatev
er, and it just drove my 
mother crazy. She couldn't 
stand those things. She was almost willing to 
go and be caught. My father just about 
forcible put her in there because, you know, she'
s not afraid of the N
azis, but she's afraid 
of the potato bugs. Obviously she we nt down 
eventually, but it was 
not a pleasant place 
to be. It 's damp and eventually I got si ck. I 
became very sick and some  kind of bronchitis 
and they thought I would die. My father went
 out in the mi ddle of the night and he went 
to a farm some place...don't know wh
ere...and he stole. I me an that's the only words for it. 
In a sense he stole. He milked a cow, a
nd he brought back warm milk. The only warm 
thing we could have because there wa s no fire 
or anything. It was col
d. And that's what I 
drank. And I don't know if the milk helped, but
 I became better. So he stol e some milk. 

Not a terrible crime. Anyhow, after that we 
could not stay there anymore, and then we 
moved to another family. Whereas the first 
family had some  relationship and they had 
some reasons and they had reason to believe 
that  we would really reward because my 
father promised and the grandfather and all 
that stuff, which was all true. This other 
fa mily, we kinda knew them, but there was no sp
ecial relationship. And this other family 
was very poor. They had a lot of kids and they were very poor. They didn't have enough 

to feed themselves and they took us in. No 
ulterior motives. They didn't ask for anything. 
And these are the people that we really ga
ve everything we could, even more than the 
other ones. There were two fa milies. Ok
ay?  Andamazing people. Sienkowitz and 
Bagdanowski. I should say the name s. Thes
e are important people. Two fa milies. 
Sienkowitz and Bagdanowsky. And we
 hid in a barn over there. 
We  were in a loft in a 
hidden compartment in the loft and that was what I reme mbe r  the most of the hiding and 

it was, for a young kid I 
didn't realize it then. 
 

02:06:10 

  

 As an adult I really don't understand how I su
rvived it and be half-way normal because it 
was tremendous sense of deprivation. It 
was dark. Everything wa
s closed. There was 
some light fr om the chinks in the sl ates in
 the roofs but it was dark during the day and 
during the night. And there were always pe
ople, strangers whoever, so you could not 
speak out loud. So for over a year I was in the 
dark and I didn't  speak. And that's  a crazy 

environment. And I don't  know. I can't  say I'm completely normal, but I don't think I'm 

very peculiar. And so maybe that's  a good sign that people can overcome all kinds of 

stuff. And we stayed there for just about a ye
ar. Now I need to back track one thing what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
13 
 
kept us going and what kept these people 
going which is what happened about 2 months 
or so after we reunited with Father. You will 
recall from history that when (General  von) 
Paulus was surrounded and captured in Stalingr
ad in January of 1943, I believe it was. I 
would have to look it up. And the Russians ma de a big propaganda deal out of it. They 

dropped leaflets all ov
er...not Germa ny ma ybe, but all over 
the prior Russian territories. 
Not only telling about it, but with
 complete pictures so it co
uld not argued that it's a fake. 
Or from Paulus and his bedraggled remnants of army or whatever thousand they 

captured...I don't know...300,000 that were there s
howing that they really were captured. 
This was a tremendous celebration for us. Fath
er was convinced everybody that we talked 
to...all the...all the Gentiles were convinced
 that there's no question who would win the 
war. It was no longer a issue of which side am
 I going to be on because I don't want to be 
in trouble with the vi ctors. The victors were
 going to be the Allies. The Germans were 
going to lose the war. There was just nodoubt. No ma tter what the Germans said, no 

ma tter what they did. Once when Paulus was 
destroyed in Stalingrad, as far as we'r e 

concerned, it is a ma tter of how long will it
 take . Made life a lot easier. All the 
uncertainty was gone. All we had to do is stay 
alive. And these people were certain if we 
were alive, eventually we would be liberated and if we could do some thing for them 

because they were poor people
...the se last ones and the prev
iously ones were not so poor, 
but even so we would keep our word. 
 

02:09:00 

 

 So it changed everything. That victory in St
alingrad had special me aning for me  because 
it really was the turning point as most histor
ians say of the war in Russia, but also the 
turning point of belief in what was comi ng among those people who had to survive...the 

rema ining Jews. 
 

Q: Tell me  a little more about life in the atti
c and how the farmer  helped you particularly. 
 

A: Yes. Yeah. I don't know how the deal came a
bout, but my parents...my father used to go 
out and work some ti me  on the farm. If some
body saw him, they could get away with it. 
His hair had turned completely grey. I mean
 completely grey, prematurely grey. And so 
rather than use his regular name  which hims
elf was not necessarily a Jewish name  his 
name  was Wolf and in Polish it's Ulfa so it 
could be ma ybe not a Jew, but it's sort of 
Jewish. So they started calling him Stary. Stary in Polish means the ol d one because of 

his grey hair. And so he acquired the ni
ckname  Stary and on that basis nobody would 
know who he is. "Who's that?"  "Oh, that's 
Stary. He came to help us.ﬂ Or some thing. 
And so he could go out during the day. My 
mot her could go out sometimes. Her Polish 
was quite decent. My brother's Polish was not
 wonderful, but not too ba d because he had 
gone to school prior. I didn't know a ny Po
lish. I could only speak Yiddish, and I never 
went to local school. My Polish was just wo
rds that I picked up, you know. You live in a 
town you pick up Polish, but it's not as if 
you live in the United States, where you live 
here you speak English fr om birth no ma tter what
 your ethnic heritage
. Over there if you 
were Jewish you spoke Yiddish. Wh o spoke Po
lish unless you went to school or when 
you got older. So my Polish was just awful.
 I don't know any Polish to this day. I know 
Russian because this...this one and a half y
ears wa s really Russia
n...Russian school so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
14 
 
I...I have some  decent knowledge of Russian. 
My Polish is just useless. My brother's 
Polish was not that terrible. He could go out
. I could not go out. It was dangerous. If 
some body s a w me  and said some thing to me , as
 soon as I opened my mouth there was no 
question I was not a Pole. I was a Jew. And I 
couldn't pretend to be Lithuanian either 
because the accent was just wrong. So they ma de 
a deal or  agreed or whatever, one night 
the farmer came and he said, "We're going 
for a walk.ﬂ So wonderful. "Come on, We 're 
going for a walk.ﬂ And so we went for a wa
lk. And it was wonderful. Just him and me . 
Nobody else. Still who knows who would see us
?  It was very dangerous. There were 
rewards for Jews. 
 

02:12:00 

 

 The reward was salt. I hadn't seen that wr
itten any place. The reward was salt. I don't 
reme mber how ma ny kilograms of sa lt. Salt 
was a great commodity. Very hard to get. 

Very precious. People wanted salt more than 
sugar. And if you handed in some  Jews you 
got salt. People looked for the reward and 
there were nasty people who would do it for 
the reward. They would do it out of spite. While
 we were hiding there, there was a family 
hiding in the woods and one day, some  so-
called great patriotic partisans who were 
fighting for the country...Poles in this case
...found them. They took them out. They shot 
them...saw it through the roof a 
little bit. And they came into the house. They asked for 
some  to drink, and they told the farmer, "G
o bury those people.ﬂ And they were sitting 
there talking in the house talki
ng next door to the barn where 
we were and then they left. 
And they were Poles, Army Krajowa fromLondon. There were other partisans, mostly 

Russians. One day my father was caught by them
 and he was sure they were going to kill 
him. And then they looked him over and they decided he was a Jew. They didn't know 

who he was because he stumbled on them. 
He stumbled on their camp goi ng through the 
woods. And then they looked him over and th
ey decided that he's a Jew. They didn't 
know who he was because he stumbled on th
eir camp going through the woods. And they 

said to him, "Don't worry. We 'r e not going to
 hurt you. We 'r e just like you.ﬂ In Russian 
"Vi tozje takoje" which means we are also lik
e that. Those are the exact words they sa id 
because Father repeated it, so I'm re peating 
you what he said. And in fact they said, "Do 
you have any food? "  He says 
"No.ﬂ "Come here.ﬂ They had shot an animal. Don't know 
where. Maybe...probably a farmer 's animal, and 
they gave him a quarter of beef to take 
with him. They sent him on his way. Didn't hur
t him. They we re prisoners of war. The 
Russian prisoners of war were treated abom
inantly by the Germans. There was a prisoner 
of war camp not far from Soly and obviously 
the Jews were all eventually, they say 
eliminated and Soly was sent off to   Pona
ri near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps 
were not eliminated, but none of them surviv
ed. The living conditions in the ghetto were 
a hundred times better than the prisoners of war.
 The Jews used to give them food if they 
could. They were starved to d
eath and worked to death, thos
e Russian prisoners of war. 
And when they escaped their hatred for th
e Germans was some thing unima ginable. They 
would very glad die as long as they coul
d take some  with them. And ma ny of them 
became very sympathetic to the Je ws, especia
lly if they came from 
a camp like the one I 
described where the Jews in the ghetto trie
d to help. So even though the Russians were 
not that well known for their love of Jews, th
e Russian escaped prisoners of war were not 
that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.

02:15:00 

 

 And this particular band helped my father. We
 learned later that this band was wiped out. 
They got into a fire fight with some body, 
and they were all killed apparently. Don't 
know. But anyhow, so we lived in 
this little place and about on
ce a week or so, from t hen 
on, we was determined we go for a walk for a hour
 or so at night alwa
ys, look at the stars, 
talk a little bit. Was not a very imaginativ
e conversation because my Polish was not that 
great. They were wonderful people because 
one da y there was a big scare that some body 

had seen us there too. And we didn't know what
 to do. So we decided...they decided...this 
was a tremendous chance. I can't  understand ho
w these people decided to do this. It was 
totally insane . We  would just 
integr ate with the family becau
se if they found us in this 
place clearly we were strangers. And I reme mber
 he put me  in bed with his daughter. And 
it was at night because some body was supposed 
to come searching and we crawled into 
bed together as if we were, you know, liv
ing together because I was young enough. She 
was a little kid, but I think 
younger than me , so it was cons idered alright under those 
conditions because the family was very crow
ded. And the only thing I reme mber is the 
giant bed bugs. They were about this big. (L
aughter)  Huge red thi
ngs, which we did not 
have in the barn. In that resp
ect the barn was better. We  had rats or mi ce and they were 
not good things to have. They were scary atnight. But these bed bugs bit and they were 

big. They made hugh holes in your flesh, and, of
 course, there were lice and other things. 
We suffered from dysentery and lice and all ki
nds of intestinal parasites. And there was 
no...very, very bad sanitary conditions and the 
local people suffered from t he same  thing. 
It wasn't  just us. It was local conditions we
re that  way. So that ma de a big diffe rence, 
the...the walks at night. And then eventual
ly the Russian Army ca me  in and we moved 
right with them. We didn't stay. Nobody st
ayed. Anybody who survived didn't stay. We 
ended up as refugees just moving from place to pl ace. 
 

Q: Can you back up one second because we had been left with you. 

 

A: Bedbugs. 

 

Q: Bed bugs and you were in bed with this child. Tell me  about the German s earch. 

 

A: Nothing happened. Nothing happened. It 
was either a false alarm or whatever. 
Apparently, there was a search in surrounding 
farms. They didn't come  to us, but there 
was a search in the surrounding areas and some  J ews were actually taken. But in this case 

we had no place else to go. We  couldn't go in the woods. 
 

02:18:00 

 

 We had no place to go, and they decided if 
there's going to be  a search, we would all 
commingle and the German's  wouldn't know wh
o is who. And so we just totally became 
one big fami ly...was a big fa mily lots of
 people. They had...I don't know...s eems like a 
thousand kids. I think wa s some thing like 8 
or 9 children. Was a very poor fa mily. 

Staunch Catholics. And they saved us.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068

Q: What did you do in th
e attic all 
these days? 
 

A: Father educated me . He taught me  read
ing, writing, ma themat ics...whatever he could 
oral. That's how I got my primary educati
on. It wa sn't  a bad education because I did 
ma nage to survive high school and university he
re and so forth and apparently it worked, 
but it was a very difficult time because we c
ouldn't  speak very loudly and not all that 
much. Most of the time I either slept or l
ooked out through the little
 holes in the roof. 
That's  it you could not do anything else. You 
couldn't move, no exercise. You just sitting 
waiting. I really don't know. The mi nd turnedoff. I don't have that ma ny me mories of 

what I did cause I didn't do anything.  
 

Q: Think now. The Russians have come . Ca
n you describe that?   What do you mean 
when...that the Russians came. What happened? 
 

A: All of a sudden some body...I don't know who, said, 
"It's all over.ﬂ That's it. It's all over. 
There was no fighting. There was no shooting ag
ain. Just like the first time, the Germans 
left and the Russians came . Before the Russians left, the Germans came . They just...the 

Germans ran off, and the Russians rolled 
right through. A lot of turmoil. Nobody knew 
what was going on. Nobody cared. We liberated a 
house. Gave it to one fa mily, with all 
the possessions we could gave it to the ot
her family. Everything we could find. And we 
left. It's a graveyard. And we just followed the Russians. We  kept moving and they were 

moving more fast than we  were and pretty 
soon we were in Germany. And then we just 
ended up in the American zone and then we 
were in a displaced persons camp and then 
it's no big deal. Just four years of waiting for a 
visa from my father's brother to the United 

States because we were displaced persons. 
02:21:00   And once we got to the United 
States we really could do some thing. Th
en we continued correspondence with these 
families and we shipped them money and packages as much as we could because we 

were also poor just starti
ng with nothing. But to them it was a great deal. And then 
suddenly these people disappeared. We don't
 know what happened. I think some  bad 
things probably happened because these people 
were very individualistic and did not take 
too well to authority so I don't know what ha
ppened, especially the
...the so-called rich 
far mer. I don't know if t hey did something to 
them. This is still during the late...late da ys 
of Stalin, and some  crazy thi
ngs happened during that time. 
 

Q: Both fa milies just di sappeared? 

 

A: All of a sudden they...within one year they 
both disappeared. They didn't answer any of 
the letters or anything. Couldn't track th
em down in any way. So I don't know what 
happened. But anyway that's  the situation. 
 

Q: Tell me  if you would again. You were a child. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Can you describe the DP camps. You were very young and  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
17 
 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: What it was like for you. 

 

A: The DP camp was a carefree time for me . 

 

Q: By the way, which DP camp?   Do you know? 

 

A: First we were in Berlin, a
nd then we moved out of Berlin
 on the airlift in 1948 so that 
was my fi rst airplane ri de in a military transpor t. And then we ended up in, I think it was 

Bavaria. Yes...in a camp called Gaubersee ? in
 a location. There were several camps. 
There were schools. There were decent school
s. I think the school
s were good so it was 
the same  as any other child. You had an apar
tme nt, and you lived there. My parents did 
some  mi nor work. The thing was boredom fo
r the parents because you really were not 
permitted to have real work. Some  a mount to ju
st survive. Filling out millions of papers. 
Great introduction to bureaucracy. But for th
e kids it was quite good because there was a 
great deal of freedom from.pressures from out
side. There were schooling. A great deal of 
education. The teachers were enormously dedi
cated because this was the first chance to 
ma ybe raise a survived generation so there was 
a lot of dedication and input more so than 
a norma l situation mi ght call for. Children we
re precious so you could get away with all 
kinds of stuff. And it was not a bad time  from
 a c hild's  point of view. Of course, it was 
not the greatest from other aspects in terms 
of a s e ttled life and knowing what's  going to 
happen to you and having a place that's your own. 
 

02:24:05 
 
 It really wasn't  our own. We were not citizen
s. We weren't going to live there. We  weren't 
going to settle in Germany. It was just a tr
ansient camp and you couldn't call it home, but 
in terms of l i ving conditions and friends and so
 forth I feel it was nice. The adults were 
very nice to the kids.  
 

Q: How did you come  to the United States?   
What were the circumstances?  How did you 
ma nage to actually come here? 
 

A: Well, eventually a vi sa came  because, as I say, my father had a brother here and he 
vouched for us. He signed us up so we came 
under the displacedpersons act. I think it 
was the second one President Truman signed. 
I am not sure which one, but we did not 
come  as pure refuges in that sense. We ca me
 as sponsored refugees because there was a 
relative who sponsored us, who vouched we woul
d not become wards of the state and so 
and so forth so there was a quota...the  di
splaced persons quota permitted us to come  
sooner ma ybe than 50 years later. I don't know
 how long the quota would have lasted, but 
we came as part of a norma l quota of sponsor
ed people. Alright. And so we went on a 
ship. First big ship. First airp
lane, then fi rst ship. Terribl y seasick. I st ill get seasick. 
Airplanes are fine. Ships are not good for me
. We came United States, (Chuckle) and that 

in itself is an interesting story because I 
did not speak any Englis
h. And I was old enough 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
18 
 
to go to high school. We ll, there're no tricks
. No "Kunsten" as we say in Yiddish. You 
supposed to go to school, you go to school. So 
we signed up and I went to high school. 
Don't speak English. We ll, that's no ma tter.
 And you know what I did. Maybe with an 
accent, but I think I speak a reasonable English. So I came here and I went to high school 
and that's it. And as far as I'm concerned, I'
m an American because that's where my r eal 
primary education came from...my re al educa
tion...the only real sc
hooling that I have 
had. Other sc hooling was all in bits and pi
eces and in very peculiar circumstances.  
 

Q: Can you tell me  about that firs
t year for you. It must have been.. 
 

A: In high school? 

 

Q: Not easy. Yes? 

 

A: Well, it was not easy, but I'll tell you I was ve
ry naive. Of course, I was not used to any 
big cities or towns or an
ything of that nature. 
 

Q: What city?  Where are we? 

 

A: This is in Brooklyn. We 're in Brooklyn, 
New York. Nice place. We 'r e in Brooklyn, New 
York, in New Utrecht high school if
 you wish to know the exact place. 
 

02:27:00 

 

 And the people were ni ce. The teachers were
 understandi ng. At least I thought so. If I 
wanted to be cynical I would say they we
re uncaring because they didn't care what 
happened to me  and they let me  do whatever I did and they passed me  ma ybe when they 

shouldn't have. They just passed me  along. A
ll I can say, they were very nice. They 
understood my circumstances or they didn't 
ma ke it hard for me . I don't  know which. I 
had a better background in certain areas than 
the kids that came there. Mathematics, 
history, other areas, the home  education, and 
the education in the camps was very, very 
good. Wa s a very high level education. I had 
only one problem. I couldn't speak English. 
So I had terrible trouble in English, Englis
h language and other areas that require good 
facilitive language. History, English history, 
social studies where you have to understand 
what the teacher says. The other discip
lines were no big deal. Mathematics is 
ma the matics. Two plus two is four. The sym
bol s are symbols, and I knew all that. I was 
ahead of my  class. In the other areas I di
d not do well to start with, but I think the 
teachers really were understandi ng rather than
 careless. They gave me  barely passing 
grades at first, and that was because my 
content was good, but the execution was terrible. 
And it's a mazing how well you can learn a 
language if you live among the people and 

you speak it and you interact. I 
am not a great linguist. My 
brother is the linguist. He 
speaks a half a dozen languages quite well. I 
know other languages, but only because I 
lived and...and used them, but in terms of
 learning languages directly from books, it's 
very hard for me . But it's not that difficult.
 By the time I was a junior  I was a pretty 
decent st udent. And so I ma de friends, peculiar
 friends who were wi
lling to be friends 
with this strange kid like me . But as  you in
teract and you learn the language, fine. The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
19 
 
big problem was I had to learn some  new tr
icks. My lunch money was taken away from 
me  and a fe w other little things. Nothing pe
rsonal. It was norma l. That's how it works. 

Then I learned how to protect myself. But 
initially, I think a lot of the special ed 
classesand so forth, today ma y be doing 
it all wrong, from my own experience...and 
there's too much recognition of the differences. 
 

02:30:00 

 

 I think what 's needed is to mainstream th
e kid to have normal intelligence and to be 
patient  with their diffi culties. Give them a ch
ance. But let them learn in whatever  magical 
way people absorb knowledge just like little
 children do unless th
ey'r e old...too old to do 
that, but I found at 14 it still worked. Probabl
y wouldn't work if I was 24 some thing. So I 
was just mainstreamed, left to my own devices
, and just by interacti
on I learned that l-i-o-
n is lion and Lyon (is a city) a
nd after a few corrections you re
me mber and that's all there 
is to it. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you want to add? 

 

A: Yes. Some thing that has nothing to do with
 my own experiences but
 there is very little 
talk of German re-unification right now. A
nd I don't think I have a unique perspective but 
I will tell you something that bothered me
 greatly. And it is not that  unifi cation is 
comi ng, because it has to come . I would pref
er that it be 20 years from now. The 
generation that did these things is not ar
ound any more, and I have nothing against the 
new generation. I don't believe in collective gui
lt or anything like that. It bothers me  
greatly that the loss of memory. That's why 
I am s o happy to be here. I was watching a 
news cast two months ago, 6 weeks ago. Ther
e was this huge rally. Chancellor Kohl was 
giving a rally. Okay. Lots of signs. "Ein Deutsc
hland, ein Volk", various
 things like that. 
Legitimate. And people were saying how horribl
e it was. That  they coul dn't  be unifi ed 
and so forth. It happened the same  day our 
local newspaper had pictures of the same  
rally. And the same  day I was reading Newswee
k. It had pictures of the same  exact rally. 
Very strange coincidence. And everything was 
fine. I was a little upset about this big 
rally because I am worried about reunification. 
That's  immaterial. Then I saw the name  of 
where this rally is held, and I was sick. And the 
thing that I still think about is that I have 
not heard a si ngle commentary or  me ntion of 
it any place. The rally was he ld in Erfurt. 
Now people should know that Toppensohn who 
built the crematorium of Auschwitz was 
from Erfurt and if you don't know the histor
y actually, that Toppensohn had the same  
problem that all contractors have with Governme nt, that it didn't  work right in the first 

place. And they protect themselves. You know it's only a science. You don't understand 

it. You know the mecha nics of hugh piles of 
huma n flesh and the convection currents. 
You don't understand. But you know you run some
 experi ments and we promise you, we 

will fix it, and production will be pr etty close to 10,000 a day, 
 

02:33:00 

 

 and you know great German engineering, they
 fixed it. And when the Hungarians were 
brought in, and they had this big eme r gency. 
They were able to run production at 20,000 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0068  
20 
 
a day. Why i s  it that nobody would say, you know we
 are having this great rally in Erfurt, 
and we will reunify because things are diffe
rent now. And we know that we will not 
permit another Toppensohn to come  into this
 world. That would be a great rally.. Not a 
single commentary that I have
 seen in all the news medi
a mentioned the existence of 
Toppenson but the revisionist 
historians say those were chimneys they we re baking 

bread. That bothers me  greatly. It really
 upsets me . So even though I was not in 
Auschwitz and I cannot have any recollection of
 it, when I saw those pictures all of a 
sudden all the banners and everyt
hing changed and it wasn't  people, it was just chimne ys 
and stuff. Because it was Erfurt. And I have 
no idea if Toppensohn or his son or his son's 
son are around any more . I really don't  care. Th
at has nothing to do with
 it. But there is a 
saying about knowing some  relationships and 
some how, those have disappeared. I don't 

understand why. Surely people want
 a little bit more history th
an that. I am not a great 
historians. I know that Er furt is 
Toppensohn, that is my comment. 
 

Q: Thankyou. 

 

A: Thank you for having me .
