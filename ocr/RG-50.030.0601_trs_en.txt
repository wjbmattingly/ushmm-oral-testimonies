Question:  This is the United States Ho
locaust Memorial interview with Hanny --
 
Answer:  H-A-N-N-Y, Hanny.
 
Q:  -- Leitson.
 
A:  Leitson.
 
Q:  Hanny Leitson, conducte
d by Annie Earl on th e 15th 
of October 2010 at the 
Kindertransport Association Conference in Ar
lington, VirginiA: Okay
.  Let's start from 
the very beginning.
 
Answer:  Okay.
 
Q:   Your name, if it w as differe
nt at birth, when you were born.
 
A:   It was still Hanny.
 
Q:   Your name was?
 
A:   Yes.  But I've not used it because that
's w h at my father would call me when he was 
very strict with me. I don't 
have a good association with it.
 
 Q:   And wh at's your maiden name?
 
 A:   Maiden name is Gross, G-R-O-S-S.
 
Q:   What year were you bo
rn?  Wh en is your birthday?
 
 A:   In 1925, June 16th.  It was 
a very good time of 
the year.  I like it.
 
Q:   Where were you born?
 
A:   In Vienna, right in the middl
e of town we lived.         
 
Q:   So wh at was your childhood li
ke?  Tell me your earliest me mories.
 
A:   Well, there was my father and my moth
er and my  older brothe
r who was five years 
older.  An d then a stepbrother, Paul, who was mu ch order, 17 years older, wh o really 

didn't  live with us, but he was 
part of the family.  And my fa
ther was much older than my 
mother. My father was 18 years older than my
 mother, and so  he always seemed more 
like my  grandfather to me. And my  mo ther wa
s 35 wh en I was born, so comp ared to how 
I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now,
 she seemed  much olde
r, too. And we lived 
in an apartment right in the 
middle of the city.  And so 
my father was a lawyer, an 

attorney, and he had his office
 -- I think we were on the four
th floor or sixth floor -- I'm 
not sure Œ of this building.  And he had an 
office on the mezzanine of
 that same floor, so 
he would always come home for lunch at 1:
00 o'clock, around the time that I came home 
from school.  And th at was our main meal at
 that time. And in t
hose days, children did 
not go out of the apartment 
by themselves.  T h ere was al
way s so meb ody  with  me, a 
Fräulein type.  And I was taken everywhere, to 
the park and ice skati
ng.  My father took 
me ice skating. And there was no such thing 
as really playing in the neighborhood on th e 
street.  But we did take summer vacations, le
ngthy summer vacations to either a different 
part of Au stria or to the beach in north ern Italy.
  And so then I think 
we were able to play 
freely. But during th e year, we were pretty 
constricted. My brothe
r and I were not too 
close.  The ideas in those days made a lot of
 difference.  And he was an ardent boy scout 
and he thought all of my interests were silly
 and superficial.  But whenever I was sick -- 
and I seemed to have been sick
 a good deal in those days w
ith colds and flu and so forth -
- he would play games and especially chess 
with me.  And I just recently picked it up 
again.  So that's been fun. 
And so I went to elementary 
school.  And I don 't remember 
much about it except for a gym teacher 
who was very -- who looked mo re like a 
snowman or a snowwoman.  She was built that
 way.  And I never 
liked gym. So I think 
that was four grades or five grades. And th en  I went to another school, a private school.  I 
believe it was a private school called Luithle
n, L-U-I-T-H -L-E -N.  And somehow, even  
though Jewish children were not
 allowed to go to school afte
r awhile when Hitler came, I 
think I remained in school there somehow until I could leave.
 
Q:   So the schools that you attended, were  they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish 
children?
 
A:   Yes.  Definitely.  Yes.  Yeah.  And 
th en in this middle school we had religion 
classes, and they were done with release tim
e. In other words, the Protestant children 
would go one place for instruc
tion and the Catholic children 
to another and the Jewish 
children to another. And that's when I began to
 go to synagogue a lit
tle bit.  My parents 
really didn't go.  They would go
 to their parents or my  father's  parents in Czechoslovakia 
occasionally over the -- the Yo
m Kippur, over the holidays. 
 But otherwise, no, there 
wasn't mu ch celebration of holiday s.  And 
in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many 

years until I made my mother 
buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to synagogue. 
And then when I was a tween or
 an early teenager, we would 
go to children'
s services, the 
young people 's se rvices at the mai n  synagogue
 in ViennA:  But I must have went -- I 

think I went mostly for the boys who also
 attended and then we could all go skating 
afterwards.  So I didn't take a
ll that very seriously at that 
ti me. My  ear liest memo ry  o f 
there being something wrong po
litically or worrying about wh
at's g o ing to happen to 
Jewish people was I think in
 1934 when I remember going 
on vacation by car with my  
parents to a place called Bad Gastein, a resort -type thing. And we got
 there the evening, 
at night when it was dark.  And the village 
was in the valley, and we came down from the 

mountain or hill or something.  And all the 
windows in the town, in
 the village, were lit 
up and there were candles in the window. A
nd apparently a chance
llor from Austria, and 
his name was Dollfuss, had died
.  I don't know whether he died
 or was killed.  But he was 
known to be very sympathetic to
 Hitler.  And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so 
celebrated.  And I guess those lights are some
thing I'll never forget. 
And also because my 
father was older he would alwa
ys worry about whether he'd  die before my  mo ther and so 
forth.  And he worried a great deal.  My moth
er was a worrywart, too.  And I've become a 
worrywart as well. And I married one.  I ma
rried one, too. But my father was always 

worried about the times or money or clients or
 whatever.  And he was very serious.  He 
was quite an intellectual person.  He was alwa
ys reading.  So there was really very little 
game playing in  our house except occasionally
 my  brother and I.  And th e only sport was 
ice skating.  And then I went
 to gymnastic classes as a 
little girl next door.  And 
swimming, I think. So someho
w when Hitler came to Austri
a and was practically invited 
into Austria, somehow it wasn't 
a surprise because we had always lived with th at kind of 

fear. So I don't know what else I can tell you.  I had a few good friends, but the friends I 

had went to the same school, 
but they lived  other places.  So it wasn't like you could get 
together after school.  You had to make a play
 date or something.  A little older than a 
play date. And one friend, Fran cie, did come 
to New York and I did see her once or twice 
in New York .  Oh, and anothe
r friend, Eva Schiffer.  She wa
s a real intellectual.  My 
father adored her.  And she lived around th
e corner.  And my grades were always 
compared to hers.  And I think she's a retired
 professor at Amherst or Andover now, and 
we are out of touch, although we were back
 in  touch in New Yo rk
.  And then one friend 
went to South America, to Ar
gentina, and we comp letely lost touch.  And a boy I liked 
whet to Uruguay. So ev erybody
 was spread out.  There was no co hesiveness.  And I think 
even now I envy some of my  friends who grew
 up in one town  and had their high school 
crowd and go to  reunions and all these me mori
es. So I don't have that. So I don't know 
what else should I tell you.
 
Q:   So do you remember f
eeling -- you didn't Œ did you 
recognize or celebrate any 
Jewish holid ays in your home?
 
A:   Well, we then eventually bought 
a menorah.  I don't remember celebrating 
Hanukkah.  No, really, I don 't think we did.
 
Q:   Were a lot of your friends Jewish?
 
A:   Yeah, they were all Jewish.
 
Q:   So growing up did you expe
rience any anti-Semitism in your --
 
A:   Not immediately.  Not among my frie
nds, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- 
wasn't open to that because 
there was nobody there.  An
d we had non-Jewish help, 
Fräuleins and so  forth, a housekeeper. But I 
didn't experience anything from them.  And 

of course, they had to  leave as soon as H
itler came.  Other people in my life, my gym 
teacher, my  aunt was my piano teacher.  And 
they were all Jewish. But we talked about 
it.  And my father would talk about the things
 that Hitler did.  And we would -- this is 
before concentration camps, but we were aw
are of the Nu remburg laws and of what 
happens, and you know, and how you have to
 -- how you can 't work
 any mo re and you 
can't have any non-Jewish help. My  father ha
d to get rid of his secretary.  He had one 
secretary who was with him for 30 years or 
something.  But personally, I can 't say I 
experienced it.  My main experien ce was years later when I visited Vienna the first time, 
I think, in '69. Do you want 
to hear that story?  Yeah?
 
Q:   Uh-h mm.
 
A:   With my  husband.  And since he didn't  
speak German, we couldn't  go to the theater, 
but we went to a lot of operas.  And so on
e night we went to the operA: And we also 
stayed at a hotel right across 
from the operA : We didn't  have
 time to eat beforehand, so 
we went to a restaurant nearby there afterwar
ds.  And I think generally in there when a 
place is crowded, they don't ha
ve you necessarily wait.  Th
ey  seat you with somebody.  
And so we were seated with this man who wa
s a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years 
older than I was at the tim
e. Started talking somehow. 
 And I spoke a little broken 
German.  And he said, "Oh, how co me your 
German is so good?" 
or something. And I 
said, "Well, I'm glad you th ink it's  good."  I sa
id, "I used to live here." And he said, "Oh?" 
And I said, "Well, I left in 1939.  I had to 
leave when Hitler came to
 AustriA:" And so he 
said, "Oh," and then  he fell silent. Oh, and 
he had been some kind 
of movie producer or 
something.  Anyway , he became silent and fi
ve minutes later he got up.  And it felt very 
chilly.  The Austrians were never overly frie
ndly, and they were more Nazis than the 
Germans were, I think. So again, it was not 
surprising, but at th
e sa me ti me it  was 
extremely uncomfortable.  And just such a tiny little incident th
at I'll never forget.  So I 
think if I had experienced mo re incidents 
and mo re graphic incidents, I would have 
reme mb ered.  But I just did not happen to be with people.
 
Q:   How did the Nu remburg laws or I guess 
the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you 
and your family at home?
 
A:   Well, my father I think 
not being able to have anybody
 working for you who is even 
partially Jewish. So that was the big thing.  And that meant that
 Œ you know, we had 
household help, a maid.  And 
everybody was very loyal and 
friendly and they  suddenly  
had to disappear. Fo r my  father, no help in 
the office, and the office was shrinking.  He 
was upset about that.  And so there wasn 't a
nybody in my family, whether -- we were just 
Jewish, so that wasn't  i n  qu
estion, whether we had a grandf
ather or whatever. So I think 
that was the main thing.  What
 else was in there?  I forgot.
 

Q:   You said that your father talked about
 the things that Hitle
r was doing.  Were you 
aware of the Naziism 
and what was going on?
 
A:   Yeah, I think so .  As I look back, we
 were very politically aware as children or 
teenagers.  Much more 
so than I later found kids either
 in England or America being.  
Yeah, we were.  And then, of
 course, when the annexation started.  And my  mo ther's 
half-sister lived, in Prague
, her husband, and he was -- 
I mean, they were very well-
situated.  He was the president of a bank. And 
they refused to leave.  I mean, th is whole 
busin ess over what's going to ha
ppen to us. In fact, I had an 
uncle and an  aunt in ViennA: 
And he was a government employee.  And I 
guess he was half Jewish.  He thought it 
would never happen to him. A
nd they didn't  leave, and they
 perished in a concentration 
camp. My aunt and uncle in Czechoslovakia left
 in time.  Their child ren made them leave 
just in time.
 
Q:   Do you recall -- What ar
e your memories of Hitler comi
ng to power in Austria?  Do 
you recall when  the ch ange happened?
 
A:   Yeah.  I remember that 
something Œ he immediately took
 over the radio station, the 
one means of communication.  And I rememb er -- of course there were a lot of Nazi 
soldiers around town , and th ey
 were marching in the Ringstr
asse.  Yeah. And then real 
fear settled in because we 
then -- well, it was after Kris
tallnacht.  And I guess I heard 
about Kristallnacht later.  I didn't see any of 
those terrible things ha
ppening on the street. 
But then  we began to  be really
 afraid.  The person in power 
was the superintendent of the 
apartment build ing.  And it was a question of 
wh ether he was going to  be our friend or 
foe.  And everything depended on him. And so
 I think we were all in fear that he would 

say yes, such and such, the Grosses livi
ng there, Jewish, and go take them.  But 

fortunately that never happened. My  brother ac
tually left the year befo re.  He left soon 
after Hitler came to power, and he went tom 
Germany and then to 
Denmark and later on 
to South America, to BoliviA:  So I was th
e only one left at home. And my  stepbrother 
had married.  And he was -- my father's  first 
wife was not Jewish.  So my stepbrother for 
certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn
't  grow up with anything else either, just 
nondenominational.  And he married a Jewi
sh woman, one whose sister and brother-in-
law actually emigrated to Palestine, to Israel 
then. But they left.  His biological mo ther 
was related to a very prominent Czech shoe 
manufacturer. And they were willing to help 

them get out, but only if he -- if they both
 co nverted and didn't  ever acknowledge their 
Jewish family any mo re, which they did.  Bu
t everybody had to su rviv e in those days.  
That's  what they had to do.
 
Q:   Do you recall --
 
A:   You go ahead.
 
Q:   -- when the decision 
was ma de that you would le
ave on the Kindertransport?
 

A:   Well, I think it was somehow made early in
 the year.  Early '39, it mu st have been.  
But the understanding -- all this w as, it didn 't
 seem like such a trag
ic thing because the 
understanding always was that my parents w
ould come to England tw o months later. And 
then after I left the British quarter was clos
ed so they couldn't co
me.  And they very 
fortunately were able to get to
 the United States.  And my fa
ther subsequently  died here 
two years later, so I never did see him again.
 But the good-byes were not that terrible 
because it was like, "So long.  I'm going
 to see you in  a couple of months."
 
Q:   What kind of preparation went into it? 
 I mean, did you pack?  
Did your mo ther do it 
for you?  What was the feeli
ng in your home at this time?
 
A:   Well, ironically, it was kind of up.  We  bought clothes and packed clothes.  You're 
going to need this a
nd you're going to need that.  
And so it was a rather positive 
preparation.  Kind of naive, really, when 
you think about it.  So
 I did not understand.
 
Q:   How old were you?
 
A:   I was 13 by then.  I understood, but I di
dn't expect a long separation.  And then my  
relationship with my father, while it had al
ways been good, you 
know, he was really 
overw helmed by anxiety and wo rry.  And I 
rememb er him being very short and angry 
with me a lot of the time.  And so I do reme
mb er the feeling of, oh, good, I can get out of 
here kind of thing.  And he di
d not come to the train station 
with me.  My mother sent me 
off. In retrospect, it might just 
have been too hard 
for him to come.  But it was a way also 
of getting distance.
 
Q:   What are your memories of
 saying good-bye 
to your mother?
 
A:   Well, again, it was a really warm a
nd hugging good-bye, but it wasn't terribly sad 
because it was either denial or it was "I'm g o
ing to see you in a couple of months." So 
from what I'v e been reading -- and I just don'
t reme mb er other kids and their parents in 
the train station.  It was terrible for some ki
ds.  And then th ere's that story in th at one 
movie about the father pullin
g the daughter out of the --
 
Q:   "Into the Arms of Strangers."  I just wa
tched it yesterday.  I recall that story wh en he 
pulled her out of the train.
 
A:   Did you read the bo
ok?  It's a very readable
, a nice book, very  good.
 
Q:   What are your memo ries of the journey to Englan d?
 
A:   Well, foggy.  Just sitting with a lot of
 kids on a train and wearing my name tag.  

Some people remember their number.  I don'
t  reme mb er my  n u mb e r.
  And then some -- 
When we got to the -- what was it?  The Ge
rman -- the German bord
er I don't remember 
so much. There wasn't  a border, I guess. But 
then the German-Dutch border was Œ there 

were border guards who came on board , and it 
was scary . And we thought maybe we 
wouldn't get through or something.  But 
we did.  And somehow -- I remember most
 
of this being at night, but I think maybe we 
did travel at night.  
People say wh en you get 
old your long-term me mo ry is ve
ry good, but for me my short-
 or my long-term isn 't very 
good. And so I rememb
er that anxiety and those guards 
walking th rough 
and being very 
relieved afterwards.  And so  then we got to 
the Hague of Holland a
nd got onto their boat, 
ship.  And I was very seasick so I don't  
rememb er anything good about that. And th en 
when  I got there, some  cousins of my  mo th
er's -- I don't rememb er whether they met me 
in -- what's the town that 
we landed in?  Do  you know? 
 When  we went
 to London. 
Anyway , wh en I got off the whole Kindertranspor
t, they were there. 
 And I stayed with 
them for a couple of days.  And then I met 
my  foster parents, who had been arranged fo r 
by my  cousin, in a town  called Cheltenham, which was west of London.
 
Q:   I've heard of it before.
 
A:   Yeah.  Very nice town.  
Mostly for retired people, a coup
le of public schools.  And 
they were very nice, very different.  He 
was a high school -- vocational high school 
principal, and sh e was a housewife and a Ch ri
stian Scientist and a viola player. And how 
I got to them was that her daughter had just
 married an American whom she met up at 
Camb ridge and she had to have this very, very
 bright, perfect daughter.  She was.  She 
was very nice. And my cousin, the daughter of
 these Œ the Prague uncle and aunt met her 
inlaws on the ship coming 
back from the wedding, an d th
ey said, "You know, do you 
know anybody who would take
 my little cousin?"  And sh e said she would ask her 
daughter-in-law's parents. And at first they didn'
t want to take me, but then th ey did.  And 
so I got to th em.  And I don't know wh ether I got
 to them on a Friday or not.  But I just 
reme mb er going to  school right away, like on
 a Monday, and being totally immersed in 
the language. Of course, when I get to them
 -- I mean, I had so
me English from the 
Fräulein.
 
Q:   What year was this?
 
A:   That was still '39.  
That was just before the war.
 
Q:   Do you reme mb er what month you moved?
 
A:   Yeah, April.
 
Q:   And you hadn't spoken -- Eng
lish was a new language for you?
 
A:   Yeah, more or less.  I mean, not to
tally new, but yeah.  I didn't  know mu ch .
 
Q:   What was school like?
 

A:   And also I got there at the end of that
 school year. School wa
s -- eventually, I liked 
it.  Of course, we had to wear school unifo
rms, which was totally strange.  I learned to 
ride a bike so that I could -- the school was at
 the other end of town .  It was a couple of 
miles on a bike.  And gradually I made friends. 
 I think I felt very st
range and different at 
first.  Plus, I don't think they ev er had seen 
a Jewish person before.  
I'm not sure that my 
foster parents had, except that there was -- th
e MP from that area was Jewish.  The name 
was Lipson. So it took a while, 
but then I had a couple of 
good friends in time, Megan 
and Audrey.  And I did like mo st of the teache
rs.  It was an all girls school.  In the 
summer I think I went on a farm, 
the farm of a friend of thei
rs or something.  I don't 
know wh at I did there, but I quite liked th
at for a couple of summers. I don't rememb er 
many -- I've not thought about that before. 
 I don't remember many after school activities 
or anything.  I don't know what I did.
 
Q:   Did you experience any air raids or bomb ings or anything?
 
A:   Well, really not because we were -- 
there was I think only on
e time I remember the 
sirens really going off.  We were 100 miles 
west of London, and we were pretty much 
immune.
 
Q:   Did you have contact w
ith your family, your parents?
 
A:   Yeah.  My mother was a 
writer, and she could write letters
 to me.  I didn't k eep them 
except the letter when
 she wrote to me that my father ha
d died after -- a year or two after 
they had emigrated from the States.
 
Q:   She -- they emigrated together?
 
A:   Together on the last ship, the Rotte
rdam from Marseilles, I think late August.
 
Q:   In '39?
 
A:   '39, yes.  Yeah.
 
Q:   Where did they settle in New York?
 
A:   They settled in Elmhurst.
 
Q:   Is that in New Jersey.
 
A:   No.  Long Island.  And her sister Œ one
 sister, the Prague sister,  lived in Jackson 
Heights so that was across the way right there. 
 And my mother  lived
 -- they lived in an 
apartment for years.  When I came to New York, I lived with 
her in that apartment. She 
had a huge bed, bed/sitting room.  And ther
e was another woman that she shared the 
apartment with when there wa
s no money to speak of. My
 mo th er w o rk
ed in a hat 
factory.  She did sewing and this and th at. 
 And my  father was too old to take the law 

exam.  So I'm not sure.  I think there was so me help for refugees. 
 I think they lived on 
that and my mother's 
earnings.  Not much.
 
Q:   What was your knowledge of the war 
when you were in England?  Did you know 
what was going on?
 
A:   Yeah, but not the concen tration camps. 
 But the bomb ings.  And my  brother and my 
stepbrother joined th e U.S. Army  from here
.  They  had the long way around. They 
eventually came to the States 
and he joined  the Army .  And 
he was stationed in England, 
and I would see him on occasion.  And the last
 time I saw him before he went over was 
June 6th, I think. Wh en was Dunkirk?  '41 
or something.  We met up in Manchester.  
Went to a tea dance.  That's  what people di
d then.  And th en he 
went overseas. So we 
knew about the bombings and the invasions and 
all of that.  Well, w e knew that terrible 
things happened to Jewish people, but I don't
 think we knew exac
tly what, which seems 
strange, doesn't it?
 
Q:   A lot of people experienced that, actually.
 
A:   Really?
 
Q:   They  weren't in Germany, they were
n't in it, especially if you were younger.
 
A:   Yeah.  I don't know 
if I read any newspapers.
 
Q:   What about your brother who was in South America?
 
A:   He stayed there.  He was 
with cousins.  He left them.  
They were in La Paz, and then 
he went -- he had a job in a jungle fo
r two years with a brewing company in 
Cochabamba, which is also BoliviA:
 
Q:   Did he stay there?
 
A:   He stayed there fo r two years.  I thi
nk he came  back.  Had lo st a terrible amount of 
weight.  Just a very hardship kind of thing.
 
Q:   Did he eventually  move to the U.S.?
 
A:   He came to the U.S. I think a year before
 I got married, which was '48.  So he mu st 
have come in '47. And then
 he went to school here.  He went to Rensselaer.
 
Q:   Overall, what was your -- would you say 
your experience in Engl
and with your foster 
family was positive?
 
A:   Yeah, it was definitely positive.  I mean
, the flip side was, you know, I felt that I 
always had to be a good girl because if I didn
't walk the straight a
nd narrow, then -- a lot 
of kids got kicked out of their foster homes
, from reading all these various books. Have 
you read -- well, there are a whole lot of th
em.  What's th e name?  Siegel wrote a book?
 

Q:   Oh --
 
A:   Lorrie Siegel, yes.  And then there wa
s one about a home for Jewish kids.  I forget 
what that was called.
 
Q:   Lorrie Siegel wrote the 
book in other people's homes?
 
A:   Yes, you're right.  I think she was in di
fferent foster homes. So 
you know, I think th at 
-- and I probably  had a tendency to be a goo
d girl anyway.  Those were my father's 
expectations.  It was v ery strict.  And there wa
s that. And th en they  di
dn't really get it.  I 
reme mb er my  fo ster mo th er 
saying, when  I was about 16,
 she said -- she aske d me 
whether I wouldn't w ant to convert. And I 
said -- she said, "Because
 then you wouldn't  
have any trouble and then all your problems
 were because you were Jewish.  If there 
weren't any Jewish people, there wouldn't be 
any problems." It wa
s something naive like 
that.  It wasn't anti Semitic.  It w as naive, 
I think. And I was very hurt and angry about 
that.  And I remember that being the first and, I think, the only time I must admit that I 
fasted on Yo m Kippur, just to prove that I wa
s Jewish.  Not that th
ey  ev er kn ew  abo u t  it 
or cared, but I felt better for doing that.  
And I think I had to prove to my self.  But 
basically it was that I think they  had led 
a rather insulated life and didn't understand.
 
Q:   There weren't any other Je
wish people in the community?
 
A:   Well, eventually, when I was 16 I graduate
d,high school and I got a job.  I found th at 
there wasmfree Austria organization or someth
ing and that they we
re young people who 
eventually intended 
to go back to  AustriA:  Jewish peop
le.  And they were all Jewish.  It 
was kind of a group leader, a woman and he
r husband. They were 
also Jewish.  Their 
name was Leichner. And so then  I started asso
ciating with Jewish kids, and that became 
rather insular.  That was a rather left-wing gr
oup.  We read Karl Marx and all kinds of 
discussions and stuff.  But it felt more lik
e I belonged than the rest of my life.
 
Q:   Do you recall when the war ended?
 
A:   Well, I came over here before the war ended.
 
Q:   Oh.
 
A:   My mother made application for hardsh
ip reasons in New York and got me.  I came 
here the year of 1944, Novemb er '44, on a 
ship  that took two week s on th e convoy.  And 

I was so seasick.  But she was able to get me
 to here.  And so then  I reme mb er -- I don't 
know where I was.  B u t the war ended a year later.
 
Q:   What was it like leav
ing your foster family?
 
A:   Well, I had left earlier, actually.  I had 
left probably a year or 
two before I came to 
the States because I got -- my second job 
was -- my first job was at an egg grading 

station. And my  second job was for the Si
gnal Corps because the Signal Co rps had come 
to the -- the U.S. Signal Co
rps, because they had co me 
to Britain and made their 
headquarters in Cheltenham at th
e time. And since my foster 
mo ther made me take typing 
and shorthand, when  I graduated high school, I 
got a job, a secretarial job there.  And I 
made quite a few friends. And when those gu
ys left to go to Lo
ndon to go to the 
Grosvenor House, I went with.  And I more or
 less said good-bye to 
them at that time.  
And that was probably in the spring of '44.  
I think I was in London maybe six months.  I 
got an apartment.  So I said 
good-bye at that time. And then my  husband and I went back 
one time many years later.  And my  foster fa
ther had died.  And she was living in a 
nursing home and had pretty advanced Alzh ei
mer's so that she didn't recognize me.  But 
she  eventually did.  My  husband, he wa
s very  good with her, and he was able to 
somehow refresh her memory.  E
ither that or she pretended. 
And also when I came to this 
country, one of the first things I did was he
r daughter and husband lived in Alexandria 
here.  And I went down to see them and me
et them, and we corresponded.  We sent 
Christmas  letters to each othe
r until she died last year.  S o  
that was what, 40, 50 years or 
something.  So she just
 died recently.  She was 10 years older than I was.
 
Q:   So you were able to 
emigrate to America in 1944?
 
A:   Right.  Yes.
 
Q:   And wh at month?
 
A:   November, just before Thanksgiving, I think.
 
Q:   What was it like coming to the U.S.?
 
A:   Well, again, overwhelming.  And I really 
didn't want to leave.  As much as I wanted 
to see my mother, I felt I had 
friends there and roots there.  And it was another wrench.  
But then also my mother and I 
had some difficulty at first.  
First of all, living in small 
quarters.  And I think sh e was 
getting her little girl back.  That
's what she thought.  And I 
was 18 an d felt grown up and independent.
 
Q:   How long ha
d you been -- was it like four --
 
A:   I think five years, five and a half.  It was quite a while.
 
Q:   It took some adjusting?
 
A:   Yeah, it did take some adjusting.  Yes.
  Yeah. And then I had a kind of mentor, a 
friend of my father's w ho was also a lawyer  and who worked for a big company in New 

York.  And they were friends of
 my  parents.  And so wh en 
he heard that I was coming he 
said he would get me a job.  
And he immediately got me a s
ecretarial job at this company 

on 6th Avenue, Ro ck efeller Cent
er. And he said, "Well, of course you'll go to college.  
"Because there had never been any talk of -- 
when you graduate high school 16 and there 

is no money, you don't talk about going to  
college. I don't think I ever thought further 
than a day ahead of what
 I was going to do or wh at I was goi
ng to be or anything.  It was 
all survival. So he got me th
is job and he said, "Of course
 you'll go to college." I said, 
"Oh, I will?" And he referred me to the Office
 for International Education.  And I could 
have one of two scholarships, 
one to the University of Mi
ami in Ohio and one at the 
University of Michigan
. Somehow I picked the University
 of Michigan and had a room-
and-board  scholarship  at a Jewish sorority and 
an academic scholarship. So a year later I -
- oh, and I had to take a couple of courses 
to catch up in  American history, which of 
course I needed, and in termediate algebra, of
 which I was very weak.  And so I came to 
Ann Arbor. The person I admired mo st there is 
my mother, that she was able to let me go 
again and said she wanted to do 
this, that she wanted me to do
 this.  Because I think if she 
had been, "Oh, poor me, you're 
leaving me" kind of thing, I pr
obably  wouldn't have gone.  
So that was good. And so
 that was another adjustment.  It
's been one after the other.  And 
then I had this room-and-board scholarship  at
 this Jewish soror
ity.  So I was not a 
member, n o t that I ever wanted to be in a so
rority.  But nevertheless, I had a room of my  
own.  And I made a couple of go
od friends there.  But nevertheless, I was, again, on the 
outside, even though ev
erybody was Jewish.
 
Q:   Were there other students 
who had this similar experience?
 
A:   No, I was the only student.  That's  a big 
expensive deal.  So that was hard.  And th en 
the summer I left in a co-op and made co-op friends.
 
Q:   Did you meet your husband in Michig an?
 
A:   Yeah, I met my husb
and in Michigan.  Yeah.
 
Q:   What was his name?
 
A:   Mort.  Mort Leitson.  He was a law 
student and was active in the National Lawy ers 
Guild and I was active in some
 other things and we met.
 
Q:   What did you study?
 
A:   Well, actually, I majored in English lit.
  I wanted to major in sociology, which I 
thought I Œ I knew I wanted to
 go into social work .  I don't know how I knew this, but I 
did know. And the adviser had said -- at that
 time, they didn't  have an underg raduate 
social work school, which they 
do now.  And so I said I want
ed to  major in sociology.  
And he said the sociology depart
ment is so bad, don't do that. 
 Major in English. So what 
did I know?  So I majored in English lit.  
And eventually much la
ter I went back to 
graduate school and did wh at I really wanted 
to. So I met him.  And he graduated a year 
before I did.  And he was from Flint, Michigan
.  It's a good to wn  to be from.  And so  we 
got married during my  last year of school 
and we had an  apartment in Ann Arbor.  He 
would kind of commu te back and 
forth. And th en I moved to Flin t, which I didn't want to 

do.  Orig inally he said we would live in De
nver because he had such a good time there in 
the Army.  But then wh
en he was home for that year, hi
s parents had a bakery and his 
name was well-known.  He realized that it 
was much easier to be in your own practice 
when  your name is known as not.  And so we st
ayed there. And th at was a very different 
family.  It was an eastern Po
lish family, and they spoke Yidd
ish.  They weren't Polish, 
but they were from there.  Th ey were first-generation, his parents were.  And for them, I 
wasn't Jewi sh enough, for my mother-in-law.  I wasn 't 
Jewish enough.  I didn't have 
enough money -- or any money. Bu t we got over
 that hump.  My father-in-law was a very 
nice man.  My mo ther-in-law was a very ni
ce woman, too, but 
very determined. So 
anyway, it was a good town  to raise our kids.
 
Q:   How many ch ildren did you have?
 
A:   Three.
 
Q:   What are their names?
 
A:   Karen, who is here, is 
my  oldest; and Mark is in the middle; and Ru th, Ru th  Leah  is 
an artist down in Asheville, North CarolinA:
 
Q:   And your mother 
stayed on Long Island?
 
A:   She stayed on Long Island until four ye
ars before she died, wh
en she came to her 
cousin, really. She didn't say she was unha
ppy in  New York .  I don't think she was, 

actually.  But everybody was getti
ng older.  And even  her friends
 -- New York is hard to 
get around in.  And everybody was getting 
older and her doctors' offices were in 
Manhattan.  Everything was a chore.  She 
was just getting too old for New Yo rk. And so 
I really didn't want her to live with me, nor di
d she want to any mo re than I want to live 
with my children.  We did find her an apar
tment right near my  house, and that really 
worked out very well. In the end,
 I was very glad I did that or
 we did that.  It was a very 
nice, tiny apartment, but she was very happy th
ere.  She could come and have meals with 
us and go on vacation and so fo
rth.  So that worked out well.
 
Q:   Did you ever speak to 
your mother about what it was lik
e for her to send you on the 
Kindertransport?
 
A:   Not afterwards.  I don't 
think -- She did it, and she did 
it as good or as well as could 
be expected.  I don't think we talked about it 
afterwards. She mu st have been very strong 
if she could send me -- allow me to get 
away again.  So that was very good.
 
Q:   You said that your children have
 interviewed you like this in the past?
 
A:   Well, we're working at it.  There'
s never enough time when we get togeth er.
 
Q:   So you've spoken to 
them about your ex periences?
 

A:   Oh, yeah.
 
Q:   Do you have gran dchildren?
 
A:   Yes.  My one granddau ghte
r is coming, the oldest, who is 32.
 
Q:   Have you ev er -- have they asked ab out your experien ces?
 
A:   Oh, yes.  I mean, she ha
s seen the movie and read the bo
ok and asked.  We'v e talked.  
Yeah. Everybody -- I spoke at my
 grandson's school in Ch ic
ago one time.  So I realize 
that a lot of people in my ge
neration have not talked about 
their experiences, but I think 
it's people who have lived through horrendousthings and ju st couldn't talk about them. 
But in our family, it w as okay.  Maybe late
r.  Not when they we
re little, but later.
 
Q:   Is there anything else 
that you would like to add about --
 
A:   No, not particularly.  Is there anything
 you feel that you want that I've left out?
 
Q:   No.  You have a lot of really 
great memories and insight into this.
 
A:   I really don't -- funny th at I don't feel 
that. It feels hazy.  Bu
t I guess when you talk 
about it, it beco
mes le ss hazy.
 
Q:   So you remember things
 once you start talking about it?
 
A:   Right.  Yes.
 
Q:   You had two brothers -- or stepbrothers --
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   -- who fought in World War II for --
 
A:   Yes, the United States Army.
 
Q:   And did he come back
 to America after the war?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   And your brother had also 
immigrated from South America?
 
A:   Yes, from BoliviA:
 
Q:   How old was he wh en he left home?
 
A:   Well, he was -- he had finish ed high sc
hool. He was 18, probably , just after high 

school.
 
Q:   So did he decide that he on his ow
n initiative would -- because he went from Austria 
to Denmark?
 

A:   Yeah.  Went to an agri
cultural school there.  I don't know
.  He was interested in that 
at the time.
 
Q:   Okay.  Was it very difficult for your pare nts to get a visa to emigrate to the U.S.?
 
A:   Well, it was hard, but I 
think my  cousin pulled all kinds 
of th ings and got strings and 
got affidavits and all of that.
 
Q:   That was the cousin that was in the U.S.?
 
A:   Yeah.  Very fortunate.
 
Q:   And your maiden name was Gross?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   I think that I've
 asked all the questions.
 
A:   I didn't think I had 
anything to say to you.
 
Q:   This has been wonderful. 
 Thank you so mu ch for sharing.
 
A:   You're welcome.  Th
ank you for taking the time.
 
Q:   Absolutely. So this concludes my 
interview with Hanny 
Leitson with the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
at the Kindertransport Association Conference in 
Arlington, Virginia.
 
A:  Thank you. Do  you suppos
e I could have a copy of this?
 
Q:  Definitely.
