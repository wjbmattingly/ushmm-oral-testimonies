T his is the18th season of the

program . It's one thing to learn about a 
subject likethe Holocaust throughm ovies or through books
---
 a
nd I'm  a librarian so I'm not

to be here today.
 
 
Alex will share hisf irst personaccountfor about 45 m inutes or so. And at the end, if  
we have tim e, we will give the opportunity for you to ask questionsof
 
Alex. T henas is the 
tradition with the
 
F i rs t  Pers o n
 
program ,Alex wi ll have the last wordfor the day.
 
 
T hem useum is,f irst andforemost,am em orial to the victim s of Nazism  and the 
Holocaust but it is also an educational institution. It's one that challenges visitors to think about 

thediff icult questions that this subjectposesto usas individuals and collectively as 

comm unities and groups. T hese questionsdo not always have straight forward answers. 
 

2 
 
T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend 
the decades.W hat you are about to hear from  
Alex is one individual's accountof  hisexperiences during the Holocaust f rom  hispersonal 

perspective.T his isnot a com prehensive history of  the Holocaust, not a lecture, it is not even a 

com prehensive story of  one aspect. It isoneperson's story.
 
 
T o help introduceAlex and his story we' ve prepareda brief slidepresentation. This is 
A le x in  h is  Cu b
 
Scoutunif orm .W eare privileged tohave a Cub Scout
 
--
 
or aBoy Scout troop 
with us today. And Alex has 
off ered, af terwards
, 
to perhaps sing the 
B o y S
couts song thathe 
rem em bersf rom a child.
 
 
Alex was born ina city called Strasbourg, France, in 1933. Thearrow on this map 
pointsto Strasbourg. It's right on the border with Germ any. If there are any students studying 

the European history, you m ay recognize the region nam e.T his region was traded back and 

forth over the centuries. After every war, it was France,then Germ any, then France. Af ter 

W orldW ar I it was part of  France but it was very close to the b
order.
 
 
Alex's f am ily had em igrated to Strasbourg f rom  Poland in the 1920s. His father was a 
traveling salesm an and his m other had been trained as a Hebrew teacher. The fam ily lef t 

Strasbourg andm oved to Paris in 1938.
 
 
W hen the Germans invaded France in 1940,Alex's f am ily joined the tensof  
thousands of people whofled to the South ofFrance where a collaborationist government 

called Vichy France had been setup. You can see the line where the Germ an
-
occupied north 
zone divided between the northern
 
zone 
andthe collaborationist southern zone. W e'll hear 
Alex's story about where they visited and what thatm eant to hisfam ily. But I will also pointout 

the annexed part
;  
hadthey notf led, they woul d have been caught up in Germ any proper.
 
 
W hen the Germans invaded France in 1940, they f led south toa town 
near
 
T oulouse 
c a lle d  V illef ran c h e
-
de
-
Rouergue. AndI apologi ze to m y high schoolFrench 
teacher f or 
m ispronouncing that. T
hat is thetown where Alex's f am ily eventually m oved.
  
 
Alex's m other
 
f e ll ill a nd  A le x' s  A u n t Cylli,  
wh o we see inthis photograph, came to help 
take care of Alex and his family.
 
 
T hroughout the war, Alex and his sister madMadeleine were ableto attend schools 
andeven sum mer camps. T hey lived a relatively 
norm al lif e, e
ven after the Germ ans invaded 

andoccupiedall of  France in Novem ber
 
1942
; t
h at  i s ,  un t i l  S ep tem ber
 
1943 whena Germ an 
crackdown on Jews 
in  
the town intensif ied. And Alex can talkaboutwh y that happened and 
what that m eant f or his fam ily.
 
 
Alex, Madeleine, andCylli were able to escape ina nearbyf orest.Af ter the war, Alex 
andhisf am ily returned to Paris. Afew years af ter that Alex m oved to Israel where he served 

for two years in theIsraeli 
Defen s e  F
orces and went on to have a successf ul career as an 
agronom i
st or agr
ic u lt ura l s c ie n t is t .  H
e workedf or the United Nations on international 
agricultural products which took him  tom any different countriesaround the world. Hem oved to 

the UnitedStates in1989 where he continued to work on international agricultural project
s
. 
E
ven af ter retiring, Alex continued to translate documents and contributeto thatf ield.
 
 
Alex is m arried. Hehas three children,f ive gr andchildren,and he volunteers at the 
m useum  on Mondays andThursdays.
 
 
You've heard enough of  his story f rom m e.Let's hear the story f irsthandf rom Alex 
him self . Please join me in welcom ing Alex Schiffman

Sure.

>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
I see we havem any scou
ts here. The picture
 
--
 
can you put back the 
picture?
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W e'vealready been closed. Sorry.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
W ell, you could seeI was in unif orm  and the beret, inthe m iddlewas 
the sign of the Cub Scouts in France. And you can see in them iddle of  it a little wolf .T he 
wo l f  
was becauseour Bible was ﬁT he Junglebook.
ﬂ 
You had mother wolf andfather wolf .And we 
gave nam es, nicknames
. O
f all the names possible
, 
I was gi ven the one of Mo
w
gli, who was 
the little boy who was adopted by the wolves. I rememberm yself crying ever y tim e I read 

about thedeath ofm other wolf .
 
 
Now, the two stars is just after af ew years, one or two years you get one star, af ter 
another year you get the second star.This is the veteran you are.
 
>> Ronald Colem
a n:
 
Thatpicture, you were older, probably 9 or10.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
9 or 10.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
So that was not when you were in Strasbourg.W hat do you rem em ber 
about your early lif e in Strasbourg?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
V e ry lit t le .  Ve ry lit t l
e.W hat I know is m orewhat m y sister toldm e. I 
hada sister,passedawa y. She was seven years older thanm e. She told me afew things. She 

said thatm y m other,for instance, was a certif ied Hebrew teacherbut she never taught. She 

had to help m y father t
o makea living. She worked as a seam stress. She worked very har d.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
And yourf ather was a salesman? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
My f ather was a traveling salesman,m eaning he had clients
 
--
 
h e 
representedmanufacturers of  leather goods like wom en's bags andhandbags, etc. Hehad 

clients which he visited regularly. So that washis prof ession.
 
 
Now, during the war
 
--
 
I ' m  s o rry
 
--
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
No . It's o k.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I under
stood only after the war thatm y f ather
 
--
 
we were all French 
citizens. My f atherhad a Fren
ch  I.D. with  the re d  stam p Je w o
n it.Iunderstood only after the 
war when heboardedhis train on Monday morning, there was absolutely no guarantee we 

would see him  on Friday or Saturday. Therewas no guarantee.I understood only later, af ter 

the war. But that was his job. Hehad afam ily to providefor, to support, and he didhis job.
 
At the endof  the war I guess becauseof  thatm y f ather was not
 
--
 
not ver y old. He was under 
50. Buthe was worn out
, a
 
widower tra veling during all the war, f orthe whole duration of the 
war, under the threatof being arrested.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W as yourf am ily ver y r eligious?W ere they observant? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I wa s to l
d that bef ore the war m y m other kepta kosher house. After 
the war m y m other was notthere and because
 
--
 
m aybebecauseof the war we didn't keep 
any kosher.Butm y father insisted that I attend Jewish high school.At the tim e I protestedbut I 

a m  ve r y g r a
tef ul to him
 b
ecause in the Jewish high schoolI learnedHebrew. And if I know well 
the Hebrew gram m ar, it comesf rom there.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Did your fam ily
 
--
 
what language did they speak when you were young? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
My parents, I guess, used to speak Yiddish. I know that I spoke a 
kind of Germ an. And when we moved to Paris, the French cam e.Even thattransition was kind 

of f unny becauseI used to speak som etim esthe words which was half Germ an, half  
French, 

the word itself . 
 
>> Ronald
 
C o l em a n:
 
So your fam ily m oved to Paris in 1938.T hat was before the war started. 
Did they m ove because the threats that they hadheard?
 

4 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
No,no. Simply it wa s m ore central to France. Andm y father was 
traveling. Norm al path for imm igrants likem y father was, f irstof  all,for af ew years you 
represent afew f irm s, you have your own clients and you travel. After then when you havea 

little bitm orem oney, you open your own business.T hat was the norm al path. And that was 

the path m y 
f ather's elder brother went through
, th
e path he followed.
 
But the war caughtup 
andm y father couldn'tgo in that path. At theendof  the war hehad to kindof  rebuildhis 

clients. He was worn out
, n
otold but worn out.
 
 
Later in his lif ehehad the joy of having two granddaughtersf rom my sister. And he 
was also happy because m y sisters with a dentist and shehada very successful career. She 

hada happy marriage two daughters. My father was ver y happy.
 
 
T o say thathe was
 
happy with m e, Idon't know. T his is a seriouspoint. I decided I 
would not serve in the Frenchm ilitary. T hat was a tim eof  the war inAlgeria. I was a Zionist in 

all thetim e but if  Ihad to serve in them ilitary, I prefer
re d
 
to serve inIsrael. So I left France. I 
was a draf t dodger in France. I don'thide it. I'm  not especially proud of  itbutthis is what I did. 

T his isaf act. AndI served two years in the ID
F
. Andf or seven years I couldn't come back to 
France until there was an am nesty. Then I 
took advantage of  the amnesty.
 
I  c am e
 
back to 
France to visit m y f ather.
 
>> 
Ronald Colem an
:  
That's in your later lif e. W hen youf irstm oved to Paris, though, you were 
only 5 or 6 years old.Right?W hat do you rem em ber of  your lif e inParis? Did you start school? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I  we
nt to a school
,  
which I guess still exists. I know exactly where the 
school is.And I know exactl y the apartm ent where we were. T he surprise was I rem em ber the 

gates
 
--
 
we li ved in a project, ina housing project. I rem em ber themain door to the apartment 
building. And I remember it was a big, big, big door. And when I cam ebackaf terthe war, 

suddenly the door shrank. [Laughter]
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
You got larger, Ibelieve, is what happened.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
Righ t .
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
So what was your lif e like? Did you have lots of f riends?W ere they 
Jewish? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
In France I wentf irst to Jewish high school. Andthen three years in 
the French secular school, public school,public and secular.At school we had goodf riends. 

B u t o
nceout of the school no friendship.W e didn't go to each other.I went once to
 
a f riend 
f rom  school, a schoolm ate as we called him , becauseIf orgot something or I wanted to learn 

som ething about the hom ework and som ething. I had af eeling of  uneasinessf rom him when I 

cam e tohis house. Most of m y f riends weren't Jewish, f rom the Zionist m ovement.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Yourf am ily li ved in Paris in 1939. This is when the war broke out, when 
Germ any invaded Poland in the east. You were very young, obviously. You might not 

rem em ber or heardm uch about the war.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I was born in 
`
3 3,  
`
34, the real war
 
--
 y
ou m ay know thatW orld W ar II 
off icially started in September
 
1939 and the French called it
 
the PhoneyW ar.W hy the Phoney 
W ar
? Because th
ere was no war. Until April, 40, whenthe Germans suddenly invaded France 
andbypassedthe French fortif ications whichwere on the border, they attacked Belgium and 

then went to Francefurther north.T hey beat the French inam atterof  three, four weeks. U
n t il 
then it was called the PhoneyW ar because there was no war.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
And yourf am ily, they fled imm ediately.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I think it was in 
`
40, I think.I rem em ber that we had to take a taxi 
f rom  Paris, about 60
 
miles south of Paris becausethe trains were not working. I think the 

5 
 
bridge
 
--
 
there was a bridge there, a big bridge.T om e it was alm ost im mediately destroyed. 
So we tooka taxi.W ecrossed thebridge and we took the train tothe South. Itm ust have been 
som ewhere beg
inning
 
--
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Did you travel with just yourf am ily or were there otherf am ilies inthe 
comm unity that traveled with you?
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
Idon't know if it was with anotherf am ily but m y m other'sbrother's 
fam ily, his wif e and son, m y cousin went to the sam e town. And also another sister, they went 

with t wo daughtersto the sam e town. It was in the center of France
, m
ore or less geographical 
centerof  Frances. I can remember thefam ilies together because we went to the same school, 

t
hefour of us, m y sister, m e, andm y cousin andfemale cousin.Then som e leftfor 
Tunisiaand 
theother two fam ilieswent [Indiscernible].
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W hydid you g
o  to tha tto wn ?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
One good reason. My m other's uncle was there. My m other's uncle 
i m m i gr a t e d f r om
 
--
 
then it was Austria to France. He was 15, som ething like that. Hem ade the 
kind of living in Paris. That's a whole story.
 
 
At som e point whenW orldW ar I started, he found him self
 
--
 
no. W hen W orld W ar I 
started, he was, him self , an Austrian citizen,m eaning enem y citizen. He was assigned to live 

near that little town where he methis wif e. And af ter thishe settled there.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Yourf am ily, it sounds like they were ver y f ortunate they hadf am ily.
 
>> A l e x 
S ch iffm a n
-
Sh ilo :
 
W e went to him .W e called him Uncle Max.W e wentthere. At the 
beginning of W orldW ar II, he losthis son. His son was killed asa young off icer in the French 

A rm y
, f
ighting the Germ ans.
 
 
Andone very painf ulthing I saw af ter the war. I could go to the housefreely, just 
knock on thedoor,open, com e in. AndIf ound they hada little radio. They were listening
 
--
 
I 
found his wif e sobbingquietly. And the reason was that the radio,at the endof  the war, the 

radio broadcasted thenames of all the French POW
s 
who were releasedand were com ing 
back home andher son didn't com e back. He was killed.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
How did the rest of the town treat you?W erethey hostile toward you?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
No.In that little town everybody knew we were Jewish.W e were 
som e 20, 25f am ilies. I don't remem berexactly how m any but som ething like that.T he 

population was nothostile. The gendarm e, which is the equivalent ofthe troopers, when they 

hadonce or twice
 
--
 
they warned us, warned the m
en, thatthey hadto go into hidingfor a 
couple of days. Because they hadorders to arrest them . 
 
 
Now, during the summer we went tothe countryside
, 
a little Ham let in the countryside
. 
To
 
this day I don't know if it was f ora vacation or if  it was tohiding or if it was am ixture of both. 
I don't know.
 
 
One thing I rem em ber. In September
 
`4 3 --
 
one of  your questions
. I
n September there 
was a rebellion inside the Germ an Arm y, theGerm an occupationtroops. It was a rebellio
n by 

Croatian soldiers against their officers.T hat rebellion was crushed by other Germantroops 

with utter brutality. That's anotherdetail. And they puta curf ew onthe town.T hey put posters 

explaining what the curfew was. Andthe last line said: Don't be inf luencedby the Bri
ts and the 
Jews. And we saw theJews and said, maybeyou should go intohiding for a couple of days. 
 

 
So we succeeded somehow to bypassthe curf ew and went away f or a couple of days.
 
T he program was to take m y father outof  thetrain beforehe comesback to the town
.  We 

knew exactl y the
 i
tinerary, we knew which train he wouldbe in. My sister and me went to the 
near
e
st station to where we were hiding. T hetrain cam e
, s
topped two m inutes. In two minutes 

6 
 
there isno tim e to gothrough the train. And the train started to pull out.And here m y father 
shows up at the window. So we, m y sister and me, we ranaf ter thetrain.These were steam  

trains.T hey start very, ver y slo wl y.W e ran
 
af ter thetrain.W etold him, Dad, papa, turn back 
next station. And so he came. I guess that when we lef t, somebody lef t him  a note that we 

have to go.So we picked him  up.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
This was 1943. So youwere 10 years old at this point. By thatpoint the 
Germ ans hadoccupied the restof  Francefor close to a year.
 
Do you rememberfee
lin g in  
danger bef orethe poster that you saw? 
 

>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
No . I 
don't. I don't know. One thing 
--
 
m y parents didn't tell me 
ever ything. T hat's obvious. T hat's obvious.
 
One day I came back
 
--
 
in  
`
42, som ething like that, 
we started to hear rumorsf rom  what'shappening to the Jews in Eastern Europe. Anotherthing 

was we got postcardsfrom m y grandparents.And the secondpostcard said: W eare leaving
; 

w
e don't know where we are going. T hat was im portant.T oday we know exactl y where they 
were. T hey were m arched to a nearby forestandthey were told to undress andthey were 

gunneddown in a trench. T oday we know. Al m ost imm ediately af ter the war we knew it by 

s u r vi vo r s .
 
 
So we started to hear rum ors. One day I came back hom e, said tom y parents, yo
u 
know, today I spoke with m y f riend at school,thepoor Jews, what's happening to them  in 

Eastern Europe. Andm y auntthen said," Don't talkabout that." That's it. So I didn'ttalk about 

that later.
 
 
I remember that we went into hidingfor afew nights to the scienceteacher. For me it 
was an adventure. And to this day
 
--
 
I didn't have the curiosity to ask wh y. I rem em ber that I 
went to schoolf rom  his house.W e were there two, threedays. I remember all thefunny 

details.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Ju st to step  
back f or a m om ent, your mother passed away in May
 
1971. 
And so your aunt tookcare of you.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
My aunt was her younger sister. She came totake careof  her sister. 
And af ter this she took care of  us. She stayed with us.
 
 
One other prob
lem  with m y tante was
 
--
 
and to thisday I don't know how she 
m anaged
 
--
 
she was not French. She was a Pol, Polish citizen. Although she was a dentist and 
she graduatedf rom  aFrench university, she hadno right to work. She was a Pol. How she 

survi ved all of  that,I don't know. Maybe alsoshe didn't want to talkabout it.
 
>> 
Ronald Colem an:
 
Thatunderscores how im portant it was that you had French citizenship.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
Sure.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W ere there other Jews in the town thatdid not have the citizenship?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
Ye s.  A cro ss t h e st ree t  f r
om  us there was aJewish f am ily, the Stochi 
fam ily. They had three boys, three children.Two were in m y class at school. And oneday they 

vanished.T hey were r elocated inEastern Europe.And two years ago I went to Paris tothe 

Holocaust memorial in Paris.
 
Ifound their nam eon the wall amongthepeople who were 
deported.T hen I wentto the archives and they didn't survi ve. T hat'swhat I know.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
So you, your sister and your aunt went intohiding in 1943. How long 
were you in hiding? 
 

>> A l e
x S ch iffm a n
-
Sh ilo :
 
Oh, that tim e maybe 10 days. Not very long.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
And you were in theforest.
 

7 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
In thef orest. My m other'sf irst cousin, he was a character. Asrielwas 
living in the woods but literally in the woods, his bed was markedby stones and he had leaves 
on which heused to sleep. W e went to himf or I guess a week andthen we came back.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
So if  you hadnot
 
--
 
I'm  asking a what if question, but had younot gone 
into hiding, do you know what m ight have happened to you? 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
W e don't know. That was when they had these postersand wrote on 
it don't be inf luenced by the Brits and the Jews. So we went toAsriel for maybe 10 days, 

som ething like that.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Then you came back hom e and yourf ather stayed with you. Correct?

T he news swept over France by word of  mouth. Idon't think it took 24

theallies cam e,they were rushed to the north. And part of them  went all through ourtown or

At the very beginning they occupied all ofFrance.T here was regular

T hat's a good question. Paris was liberated in August. AndT oulouse 
was liberated inAugust also.That wasm oreor less the endof  t

 I

there is no precise

I think in 1945. And then I went to m yf ather,f irst renteda room  to

Sh ilo :
 
W ell, I was a good Zionist. Ithought agriculture was a good 
prof ession to have inIsrael.
 
 
Another thing, I went to a youth movem ent which educated you
 
to go toIsrael notonly 
to go to Israelbutto join a 
Kibbutz
. T oday they alm ost 
don't exist anym ore.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
So you moved

Sh ilo :
 
Im oved to Israel. First thing Idid was toenlist in the IDF. I served 
two years in the artillery corps. T hen15 years in the reserves. 
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
And then you

di
d you im mediately then startworkin g f or the United

>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
No,no. Oh, I'm sorry. I worked at the Ministry of  Agriculture,f irst in a 
department which was a kind of  school whichtaught studentsf rom Af rica to come to Israeland 

to learn about agriculture aboutother subjects, etc.And thenI said I'm  an agronom ist, I want to 

see agriculture. I list that post andI went intotheagriculture advisory ser vice. I worked there 

m aybe 10 years, som ething like th
at. 
 
 
T hen I was them inister of  agriculture. I said,you know, they are looking f or 
agronom ist, French speaking, with experience in agriculture.That was in the Haiti. Sothen I 

went to Haiti. I spent ayear and a half in Haiti. Andf rom Haiti I started 
w
andering in other 
countries. I was em broiled
 
--
 
I was caught in the gears of the UnitedNations.I went to 
N

for a year. I wentto Rwanda, beforethe genocide,and one year inJam aica.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
And then you moved tothe United States in1989.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 `
89, yes. I got a second job in Haiti. And thenm y wif e said
, Y

Haiti, I go to the United Statesfor a doctordegree. And she woundup inthe George 

W ashington University here.And one year later
 
--
 
I used to shuttle, som e
times when I had a 
long weekend
,  
I couldcom ef rom  Haiti andthen go back. Andaf tera year I cam eto the United

>> Ronald Colem an:
 
It looks like we will have  tim efor audience questions. You will have a 
chance to give thef inal word af ter the audience questions. Butfor many people here, this is 

theirf irst time at the museum ,perhapsf irst tim e inW ashington. Isthere anything in par
t icu la r 
about the m useum  
yo u  
would like to pointout to them orm ake themaware of during their

>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
Yeah.W hen you visi t the museum , infact, the building is talking to 
us.T ry to listenand to see what thebuilding is telling.
 

9 
 
 
I'll gi ve you a few exam ples.W hen you're out of  thebuilding, you cannot see inside. 
T his is secrecy. You'll know what's happening.
 
W hen you are in the little alley where you 
expect windows, there are plates of steel.W hen you are inside, same thing. You
 
cannot look 
outside. Youhave three windows and it's black behind.This is the isolation.W hen you are in 
them useum , you don't see
 
--
 
it's not likea regular m useum where you have signs andarrows 
what to see, what programs to see, etc., youhave to look
 
for them .And this is to keep you 
conf used. That's exactly how the
 
people whowere deported, they were confused.
 
 
In them useum , if  you look from  theentrancef rom 14th Street, youhave a white wall. 
Inf ront of it, sym bolic war scene. It'sa kind of building which was destroyed. You just have the 

ca rca ss.  
On the otherhand of the hall youhave a black wall. T his isdeath. And in them iddle 
you have a slanted wall. You will see when yo u com eout.T he wall which is diagonal, you go 

straight, the black wall, death, but you don't know it. On the left yougo som ewhere, youdon't 

know where. But you live. And you don't know it.
 
 
Now, the wall is the selectionat theentranceof  the cam p. Ok? I went to Auschwit z 
last year and you seeexactly the platform  where was the selection,where people cam eby 

train. Youhad anoff icer with a little table like this. Hedidn't talk.
 
One was slave labor and one 
was gas cham ber. I'll talk aboutthis a little later. 
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Ihope thateveryone has theopportunity to visi t the museum 's 
Perm anent Exhibition. Be sure have your ticket stam ped so youm ake sure to get in to see 

that.W e also have a num ber of specialexhibits. You and I talked brief ly about one that is

>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
Yeah. T he
re is one.If you go in the lower level, therearefour 
exhibitions. One is about the genocide in Cam bodia. Cambodia is very dear tom y heart 

because I went to Cambodia with the Israeli 
Assist a n ce P

two years in agricultur al project. I stayed only fourm onthsbecausethis was the years

s o r r y.  
T he war in Vietnam started to spill over in Cam bodia.And at night you could see thef lares of  

thebom bing in theeast. So thef am ily couldn't come.And I went back to Israel. But C
am bod i a  
was a ver y, very nice place. I'm  nota travel agent but if  you can go there, there are the ruins. 

And this is where thewhole trip is.

Sh ilo :
 
Oh, during the war?I don't rem em ber being scared. Ihad no reason 
to be scared. I wentto schoolevery day. I know f or afact that I did not miss one day of school. 

T he  on l y qu e
stion Iasked after the war. AndI didnotm iss a day. Iwas not scared.W hen I 
went to sleep, it was more an adventure.They knew e xactly ho w to occupy us. Just an 

anecdote.T hey hadbooks of political cartoons. And the cartoons showed two populations. 

10
 
 
On

Italians
 
--
 
Italy is the shapeof a boot. Sothe botellosandthe cotellos. The cotellos were the 
helmets. Germany looked a little bit like ahelm et. I rem em ber that booklet.
 
 
I remember also they had for breakfast good jam . [Laughter]As youcan see, I'm a 
good eater. [Laughter]
 
 
No, I don'tthinkI was scared.Andf orm etogo to the countryside during the summ er, 
I don't know
 
--
 
as I told you before, I don't know if  it was a vacation or hiding or am ixture of  
both. Idon't know. I loved to go there.And the sheep, I used to take the sheepf or grazing. 
 
 
Also the ducks. Once I lost the ducks. I wanted to see something else and they were 
in thef ield. They just ate whatf ellaf ter theharvest, you know, you have all of  this grain whi ch 

fell onthe soil, on theearth.And the ducks knew their way back. So they started to walk back. 

And I look.W hereare the ducks?They were going bac

Ithink we have a question inthe back.

I want toask you, traveling

working with the
 
U.N. and traveling around the world, 
you m etpeoplethat m ight have believednone of this ever happened. Some of thosepeople 

m ight be in this country as we speak. So what would you say to somebody
 
--
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
You m ean deniers?

Yes. W hat would
 
you 
say to somebody who m ight not believe this happened?
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
The question of Holocaust denial. How would you respond to it?
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
I could

Another thing, that was nota subjectof  conversation. It cam e out afew tim es maybe. I 
don't remember.But, no. I don't remem berhaving m et a denier.
 
I rem em ber having m et 
deniers of  the danger facing the state 
of Israel when Israel got independent. This I rem em ber. 
Andespecially, I shouldn't be political here but peoplef rom  the left, especially, said,oh, leave 

m ealone with that whole security of  Israel.W ell, theW arof  Independence in Israel was to this 

day
 
thehardest and the bloodiest war in Israel
, t
he hardestand thebloodiest and the longest. 
A populationof  600,000. T hey had 6,000 casualties.I never calculated how it would be on the 

scale of the United States.
 
And for this I m et not exactly deniers bu
t people who were belittling

W ere you happy wit h the decisions youm ade?

T he decision to go to Israel I never regretted
, n
ever. Although it cut 
m ef rom m y hom eand m y hom e country f or a goodfew years. I never regretted it. I 

integrated
 
--
 
I was perfectly integrated inthe Israeli society. And one of  thebest ways to
 
b e 
integrated isto serve in the m ilitary. Youm eet peoplef rom the Jewish people, metm em bers of  

the Jewish people,f rom m any countries which I didn'tm eetbefore.
 

11
 
 
 
Oneexam ple. OnSaturday m orning I was in the barracks and I woke up thef irst 
Saturday andI heard there was some soldiers playing an oriental gam e, and scream ing at 
eachother in Arabic and playing with a boom box,f
ull volum e, m usic f rom  the 
Arab world. And 
I woke up
, 
I thoughtI am  inBaghdad, not in Israel.T hese were the Iraqi soldiers. I never met 
t h em  bef o r e.
 
 
Another thing were the Yem enites.T he Yemenites, they were darker than we were. 
T hey were skinnier than we were
 a
nd more hard
-
working than we were.We were corner 
cutters. For instance, Iwas in artiller y and inartiller y one of the hard things was to dig a 

positionf or your gun. W ell, we got instruction todig one meter deep
, s
om ething like this.And 
diggin g is hard work. They gi ve you only
 
--
 
they gi ve you, how it's c
a lle d
,picks. And they gi ve 
you shovels. You have to work. And you work  all night because everything is done at night. 

And youdon't stop working until the gun is in its position andfully camouflaged.W ell,the ones 

who f inished the job the first and thedeepestwere al ways the Yem enites
, a
lwa ys. Each gun 
comm ander couldm ore or less take his crew. And when the Yemenites were in charge of the 

gun, he selected Yem enites to work with him .T hey were al ways the first f inishedand the 

deepest.W e were tryin g to cut corners.
 
 
Yes?

Did your f ather say that he was scared?

Sh ilo :
 
Idon't know. I do not know. My sister wentto school every day. She 
was seven years older than me. She went regularly to school.If m y 
father
 
was scared, he 
didn't tell us,asfar as I rem em ber. Andm y sister, Idon't think she was scared. She knew 

better the reason why we went to the science teacher or we went into hidingf ora couple of 

days. ButI don't think so.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
It m ust have been an incredibly stressf ultime,though. You said your

I don't remem ber. I don't think so. The only thing I rem ember when 
there was that rebellion from  the Croatians soldiers, I was a goodf riend of m y aunt 

[Indiscernible].She was an Italian ref ugee. She was a Com munist.She was an endangered 

species under th

Yes?

Alex, thank youf oryour story. You li ved through one of the mostsignif
icant parts of  our 
world history. You have a capturedaudienceof  young people.W hat would you say to them out 

of  your life lessons that m ay help them today with our history that's being written as we talk? 
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W hat would be your lesson for
 
the young people in the audience? 
 

12
 
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
First of all, learning it and notforgetting it.Fight against deniers. 
Because them ore we progress over the years, the less direct witness you wil l have and the 
m oredeniers you m ight have.
 
 
If
 
today you listen to Iran Iran is a denier
, s
aying there was no such thing as the 
Holocaust.T hat's one thing. You have to learn it. Youhave toalso take a vow never again . 

You see this in them useum. Never again.
 
 
Andunfortunately it happens. It'shappened in Cambodia. It happens in Darf ur and 
som e other places. Oh, it happens in Syria right now, right now in Syria. They shouldn'tbe 

deniers.
 
 
By the way, if  you go in the museum here
,  
go tothe secondf loor, to the right, in the 
f irst hall there are a few photographsfrom  what's happening in Syria, what happened six 

m onths ago. T here is a defector, an off icial
 
--
 
a photographerf rom  the governm ent who 
def ected and he brought m em ory sticks to the museum . And you wi ll see afew of these 

photographs there. T
oday's worse. It's worse what's happening.
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
Im entionedabout themuseum as a challengeexperience. You'll see 
posters,as you leave, that challenge youthink about what you saw.W eencourage you tobe 

witnesses by visiting the museum today, by hearing Alex's story, by seeing the exhibit. You are 

witnesses to the truthabout the Holocaust and the related subjects.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an

Sh ilo :
 
And talk to yourf riends about it.Som etim es, you know

I am  a 
sensitive soul.W hen Iwork at the Inf orm ation Desk, even if it is soldout,I always f inda little 

reasonto give them  tickets. Ialways sa y
 
--
 
I conf ess this to you. I alwa ys say, don't ask 
questions about the tickets.T hen I said, youknow, when you go out, you talk about your 

f riends to what you saw here.
 
>>
 
W henever you're in the Holocaust,did you and your fam ily have to wear like stickers saying 
that y'all were Jews or nametag saying that you were Jews or no? 
 
>> Ronald Colem an:
 
It's anexcellent question. Inm any places Jews were
 
f orced to wear 
yello w stars as you'll see inthe exhibit.
 
>> Alex Schiffm an
-
Sh ilo :
 
But we never had to. My f am ily never had to. And the Jews in that 
town never hadto.
 
 
As I said, the littletown, they knew we were J ewish, these20, som efam ilies, knew we 
were Jewish. T hey wer e not hostile. Onceor twice som ebody called, you know [Speaking 

No n

>> Ronald Colem an:
 
W e wanted to make sure you all stick aroundto hear Alex'sf inal word. 
It's a  trad itio n wit

I wa n t to
 
personally to thank you all f or com ing today. I hope you have a challenging

I will turn it over to Alex for thef inalword.

Sh ilo :
 
Ok. Last sum mer I went 
to Auschwitz. I wanted to see it. So youf ly to 
Krakow. Krakow is a very nice town. In Krakow you have thef eeling, you still feel the inf luence 

of  som ebody who was called 

. You m ay not know. He becam e 
P
o pe  J ohn  
Paul II. He was the Archbishop of Krakow and you feelhim .
 
 
T hen you take
 
--
 
unf ortunately I would say Auschwit z and Birkenauare treated like a 
tourist attraction. So you take guided tours.T hey take youf rom  yourhotel. You go to 

Auschwitz. You see Auschwit z. You see the gate with thef am ous inscription
, ﬁ
Arbeit macht 

13
 
 
f re i
,"  
m eaning 
--
 
it's a deceiving inscription whi ch means work m akesyou f ree.W hen you go 
in ,  t h is  is a  t wo
-
story building. You can take pictures anywhere butone room . Inthat room you 
have a heap of hum anhair and on the side there is ablanketm
ade of  human hair. T his you 
cannot take pictures of. It's forbidden out of  respect.
 
 
In Auschwitz you see the gas chamber. Yousee the 
c r em at o r i a .
 
And in Auschwitz 
there were 
1 4 c
em atoria. It was never bombarded
. Y o
u ask yourself wh y. How come? And the 
allies knew.W hen youask the pilots, the pilots said we never got the ordertodo it. Sothat's 
one thing.
 
 
T he lastthing is, whenyou visit 
B
irkenau, theNazis tried to hide it.They blew up the 
gas chamber.And they blew up the crem atorium .But you still see the ruinsof  it. You go there, 

you see also the railroad com ing in. You seewhere the SS used tosit with the table and 

directedpeopletodeath or gas chamber or slave work
, e
tc. 
 
 
Andone question youask. The prayerf or the deceased, the Hebrew pra yer and the 
Jews f or the deceased starts with the words
, 
Kel Maleh Racham im
, 
m eaning God f ull of  mercy. 
And you ask yourself , God full of  m ercy?W here were you? W here were you? 
 

 
Now, I will end onamore positive side. Lastyear I went to a small village in France. 
And that village, I recom mend it. I can give you thenam eaf ter. That village is a little jewel in 

France. But that's not the point. Inthat village  you have a little monastery on the right. Andon 

the right, andthere's a plaque outside. And the plaque says: In this site Sister [Indiscernible] 

andanother sister, Iforgot her nam e, andother sisters hidand sav
ed
 
Jews.W e know thatthey 
are talking about 15 girls who were hidden there and escaped.T hey saved them.And that site 

was designatedas righteous am ong thenation by the state of Israel. This is what the plaque 

says. I should have
 
--
 
m y printer didn't work at home soI couldn't bring it. Anyway. 
 
 
So, now if  somebody wants questions after,I'm  open.
