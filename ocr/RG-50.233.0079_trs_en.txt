Elementary school  and Gymnasium
 
 

Public?
 

 

Public schools, y es.
 

 

Public schools in

In Vienna.
 
 

How about your parents' politic s?  For example, you were born 

towards the end  o f World War I.  Your brother was  b orn in the l ast 

year of the Aust ro
-
Hungarian Emp ire.  Must have been period of 
tremendous turmoi l and change.  Wa s your father a Republican or was  

he still Kaisertr eu as they used t o say.
 

 

I really don't k now.  We didn't talk very much a bout politics at  

home.
 

 

Did he serve in t he army?
 

 

Yes.He serv ed i n the army in Wor ld War I.
 
 

So one way or ano ther he had to se rve the 
empire?
 
 

Oh yeah
 

 

You can't tell whether or not he was glad or sad that the old empire 

had come to an en d?
 

 

I think they were  more or less sad .
 

 

Sad, yeah
 
 

How about the pol itics in the 1920 s and 1930s durin g the republic.
 

 
 
 
 
4
 
Do you recall any  political partie s that your fathe r..?
 
 

No my father was in no political p arty.
 

 

Apolitical
 
 

Yeah and we  didn' t talk much  about  politics at  home because at  this 

time you didn't talk politics to  your children 
- 
at least in our  
home we didn't.
 
 

Could you recall when the Nazis we re first mentione d if at all?
 
 

Oh yes I remembe r that very well  because it was when they killed   

Dolffus This was I think1934 .
 
 

Dolffus being the  Chancellor of Au stria?
 

 

Chancellor of Aus tria at the time and the Nazis kil led him.
 

 

That made a big i mpression on you?
 
 

Yes it made a ve ry big impression  and then when I  started workin g  

in the theater  we  had some peop le  from Germany.  Of course Jewish 

people because th e others wouldn't  come and they we re told a lot 
 

of terrible stori es and we were  ve ry much impressed  at least I was  

very much impre ss ed.  Most of our friends did not  b elieve it could  

happen in Austria .
 

 

So you knew of Je ws who had left G ermany to come to  Austria
 

 

Yes.
 

 

They told you sto ries of...?
 
 

Some of them were  in camps but at  t his time
 
it was not extermination  
camps yet I think but they told us stories and I was very impressed 

and I know a lot of people 
- 
it co uld never happen in Austria.
 
 

Do you remember a ny stories in par ticular when you were listenin g  

to these refugees  in Austria?
 
 

Y
es we had a youn g actor whose fa t her was a very  fa mous actor as a 
matter of fact in  Germany and he  t old us that he  wa s in a camp and 

 
 
 
 
5
 
that they treated him very badly but I mean they did not talk too 
much about it.
 
 

And they settled in Austria?
 
 

They settled in A ustria or tried t o settle in Austr ia.
 

 

Did your family f eel safe in Austr ia even after 193 4?
 

 

Yes actually yes.
 
 

Was there any exp erience with anti semitism in Vienn a itself?
 
 

Oh yes.
 

 

By Austrians?
 
 

Oh yes, a lot, a lot of antisemiti sm.
 

 

Do you recall any  incidents either  in the theater or in public o r  

in school?
 
 

I went to scho ol with a daughter  o f Seyss
-
Inquart. She was sitting  
next to me and sh e was .....
 
 

Do you recall her  first name?
 
 

Oh yes Inge, Ing e Seyss
-
Inquart and she would br ush her s
leeves 
when she touched us.  There  were  a  lot of  Jewish  gi rls in the class.   

Half of the class  was Jewish.
 
 

So she had to wipe her blouse of what 
- 
Jewish breath or Jewish  
germs?
 

 

Jewish germs yes I guess so.
 
 

So they knew you were Jewish or pa rt Jewish in
 
this  class?
 
 

Oh yes with the n ame of Grunbaum t here was no doubt .
 

 

There was no doubt.  How about your father did he have any 

experiences with antisemitism?  You mentioned that he was an ar my  

war veteran?
 

 
 
 
 
6
 
 
Well when he was in the army he ne ver told anything about it to us, 

no.
 

 

How about as a fu rrier?
 

 

Well he never ta lked about it.  He certainly had  some experience  

because there was  a lot of antisem itism in Austria at the time.
 
 

Do you recall wh at neighborhood you lived in Vie nna?  Was it a 

mixed 
neighborhood or...?
 
 

Mixed  
- 
but in the neighborhood  I really cannot  say that I had 
antisemitism, we  felt it in schoo l.
 

 

You had friends w ho were Protestan t, Catholic and J ewish?
 

 

Yes but mainly Je wish.
 

 

Mainly Jewish fr iends 
- 
of your  own age 
- 
both genders or just 
girls?
 

 

At this time just  girls.
 

 

How about your brother did he have any 
- 
doyou recall any 
experiences?
 
 

Not before Hitler  came not that he  talked about.
 
 

You mentioned tha t you were in the  theater.  Di d you have dreams as 

you grew up of be coming an actress ?
 

 

Oh sure 
- 
we  went  to the Vienna  Co nservatory when w e were children  
already, my brot her and I, both of us and we took up 
- 
this was 
called Kindercons ervatory 
- 
conser vatory for childr en.  I was  seven  
and my brother was six when we entered
 
and you know we had all kinds 
of music lessons 
- 
piano, singing,  gymnastic
 
 

So you were music ians?
 

 

No I was not a musician.  I go for dancing.  My brot her was studying 

piano and violin.
 
 

 
 
 
 
7
 
So at age seven a lready you were d ancing and acting ?
 
 

Oh yeah
 

 

And 
your brother was beginning stu dies in music?
 
 

Yeah he studied piano and he gav e his first conc ert when he was 

fourteen.
 
 

Do you recall wha t he played?
 
 

Yes I recall he  p layed with 
- 
the r e was a very  famo us opera singer 
- 
her name was E lizabeth Schumann  and
 
when she ga ve a concert she  
always had in be tween a you ng mu sician so s he co uld rest.   My  

brother played  w ith her the  firs t time when  he w as fourteen an d 

then every concer t she gave he pla yed.
 

 

In Vienna?
 
 

In Vienna, yeah.
 
 

And what was you r brother's grea t dream as he grew up?  This is 

your younger brot her..
 

 

He wanted to be a  pianist and a co nductor.
 

 

in Austria 
- 
In V ienna? Salzburg?
 
 

Well at this time , yeah, in Vienna , Sure.
 

 

That was the pref erence?
 

 

Oh sure Vienna wa s always for musi c.
 

 

There was no
 
talk  of leaving Austr ia 
- 
of goin g..
 
 

No not when we we re children.
 
 

Now do things bec ome better or wor se after the Dolf uss incident?
 
 

It became worse.  First of all there was a lot of unemployment.  It 

was very hard to find a job and th e antisemitism wa s pretty bad.
 
 

 
 
 
 
8
 
Even before Hitle r came.
 
 

Yeah
 

 

Did you follow th e career of Inge Seyss
-
Inquart?
 
 

No
 

 

Did you know who her father was at  that time?
 
 

Well yeah, we  kn ow something that  he was a  Nazi b ut you know  how 

old was I, fiftee n or so.We were  not so
 
interested in this.
 
 

You were more int erested in art?
 
 

Yes much more.
 
 

Do you recall any  classmates who w ere Nazis?
 
 

Oh yes we had  qui te a few.  I coul dn't tell you t he  name now becau se 

this is too long ago but we had qu ite a few.
 
 

They cause any pr oblems
 
in the class 
- 
did they try  to...?
 
 

Well they separat ed.
 

 

They just tried t o stay away. Did  they attack any students?
 
 

No.
 

 

How about the te achers.  Did you find them to be  sympathetic or  

loyal to the repu blic?
 

 

Well we had a l ot  of Jewish  teache rs in this  school  and a  few who  

were not Jewish a nd were more  or l ess antisemitic.  We had  a few  of 

them too but it w as not too bad.
 
 

You could live wi th that?
 

 

We could live wit h it, yeah.
 
 

Do you remembe r where you were  w hen the Nazis  fi nally took ove r 

Austria
? 

 
 
 
 
9
 
 
I was in Italy.
 
 

You were in Ital y. How did you g et to Italy?  Ho w could a nice  

little Austrian g irl go to Italy?
 
 

Go to Italy?It  started out that I was looking for an engagement  

in the theater a n d I had a co ntrac t to teach in  Bod enbach which is 

in the Sudentenla nd and ...
 
 

Czechoslovakia th en?
 

 

Sudentenland, yea h but they were a lready thinking 
- 
German.
 
And you had to s ubmit all your p apers, of course.  And I had a  

stage name.  My stage name was  He rmann, Trude He rm ann.  Of course 

I had to submit  my real name and with Grunbaum  right away they 

wouldn't give me the contract.
 
 

This is in Sudent enland?
 

 

Yes and the same happened to me in Linz.I had a contract there 

too and they woul dn't take me when  they found out t hat I was not
 
an aryan..
 
 

This was before H itler's time?
 
 

This was in 1937.
 
 

That's interestin g because your  Je wish name 
- 
even though you were  

a protestant ...
 
 

Yes this didn't c ut any ice with t hem.
 

 

Linz and then the  Sudentenland.  D o you remember  an y of the towns 

in the Sudentenla nd?
 

 

T
etschen
-
Bodenbac h [Podmokly]  it was called.  Tetschen
-
Bodenbach. 
And then my agent  , you know you h ad to have an age nt, he suggested 

that I go  to Ital y because he  said  I will  not get  any contract in 

a German speaking  country.
 
 

What did your p ar ents think of y ou r career in the  t heater and then 

going to Italy of  all places?
 

 
 
 
 
10
 
 
Well, I was twent y then and could do whatever..
 
 

So you had relati vely liberal pare nts?
 

 

Yes, and I went to Italy and I was in Milano when the anschluss  

came and my moth er wrote me imme diately please d on't come back 

because our contract in Italy was already not expired but had one 

more month I thin k to go and she s aid try to stay i n Italy?
 

 

And you recall wh en you went to It aly?
 

 

Yes in September 1937.
 

 

And you had what a one year, six 
m onths..?
 

 

No we had a thre e months contrac t and then we we re another three  

months so we were  in Italy in Mar ch when the ansch luss happened 
- 
in Milano.  
 
 

And you obviously  did not experien ce employment dis crimination?
 
 

Not in Italy, no.
 
 

Your mother said,  "Don't come back ."
 

 

"Don't come back,  be glad you are in Italy."
 
 

Were you glad?
 
 

Yes, very much.
 
 

So you remained i n Milan?
 

 

I remained in Milano.We had to go to vote.Th e German embassy 

came to the thea ter, took all ou r passports away  because we wer
e 

thirty girls from  Vienna.
 

 

You had Austrian passports?
 
 

Austrian passpor ts, yeah, and th ey told us we had to go to the 

consulate and whe n we were there  t hey said we had  t o go to vote on 

the torpedo boat  "Wolf" which wa s in Genoa.  We would be brought  

 
 
 
 
11
 
the
re from the Ge rman Embassy.
 
 
So the German con sulate in Genoa..
 
 

No it was a German boat and on this you voted because a boat is  

territory, right?
 
 

Okay so a German boat in Genoa was  going to be your  voting booth?
 
 

Yes.
 

 

And they gave you  of course free 
t ransportation?
 
 

Free transportati on.  And I didn't  want to g o but t here was a  very  

intelligent, I d on't know what h e was, attache o r something, who  

called me in his office and said go and vote because you won't stop 

Hitler but he cou ld stop you.
 
 

This is a German attache at the co nsulate in Milan?
 
 

In Milan, yeah.
 
 

So he advised you  to vote in the p lebiscite approvi ng...
 

 

He said vote what  you want but go to vote.
 

 

And you voted?
 
 

I voted, yes.
 
 

Do you want to te ll us how you vot ed?
 

 

Oh you had  to say  yes because  you  had to give  the  t hing, the sl ip 

you voted on, you had to give in an envelope and were not allowed 

to close the enve lope.  You  had  to  leave it  open  an d then you handed  

it to some of the soldiers who were standing there and he took your 

passport,
 
looked at your passport 
- 
so 
- 
what chan ce did you hav e  
to say no?
 
 

Right and besides  they would have  known who you w ere and it woul d  

have defeated the  purpose.
 
 

Immediately, yeah .
 

 
 
 
 
12
 
 
And were they sur prised in any way  that you were vo ting?
 

 

Yes.
 

 

They 
could tell y ou had a Jewish name.
 
 

Yes.  One soldier  said to me I think you are on the wrong boat.  We  

don't go to Pales tine.
 

 

Sense of humor.  This is a Nazi, p ossibly?
 

 

Possibly not.  Be cause otherwise h e would probably not let me vote.
 
 

And the real reas on why you voted?
 
 

Because this gen t leman told me it  would be b etter  for me if  I do 

it.  I alone cou ld not stop Hitl er but he could stop me and he  

would have.
 
 

And of course you r real sentiment was..
 

 

Not very friendly , no.
 

 

What were the rest of your family doing?  They were still in Vienna?
 

 

My father was in  Switzerland on business and he stayed there and 

did not come back.My mother and my brother were in Vienna.My  

brother tried to get out of the country which wasn't easy because 

you needed an ex i t visa in order  t o get out but  he had applied for 

an international  music 
- 
piano 
- 
competition in Brussel and with 
this he got  the e xit visa and  he w ent to Bruss els.  They didn't  let 

him play because for them he was  a  German.  And he  tried to go to 

France and
 
he couldn't get a visa to France either so I wrote him 
a letter from It a ly telling him t h at I was very  sic k and he should 

immediately come and visit me a nd he went to the  It alian consulate  

and they gave him a visa to enter Italy and so he got a transit  

vi
sa from France and got off the t rain.
 

 

Did he discover that you were sick or did he discover that you made 

up the story?
 
 

Oh he knew I made up the story.  He knew I wasn't sick.  But he ha d  

 
 
 
 
13
 
the transit visa  in France and he got off the train and went to 
Pa
ris and my fat h er was in Paris  a t this time and  s o he got always 

I think a three  weeks or six weeks visa, I don 't remember, and 

always to apply a gain and again.
 
 

So basically you  faked an illness  in order to ju sti fy this transit 

visa through Fran ce ..
 

 

And the Italians gave him the visa .
 

 

Which then allowe d him to go Franc e?
 

 

To get the transi t visa from Franc e.
 

 

And your mother m eanwhile..?
 
 

My mother was in Prague in the mea ntime.
 

 

She left Vienna?
 
 

She left Vienna f or good, yes.
 
 

What had happened to your brother's musical career if you back up 

just a little bit ?
 

 

Well he started i n Paris with Clau de Arrau 
 

 

If we cou ld go fu rther back.   He  h ad begun at age  f ourteen in  Vienna 

and then in 1938  the Nazis come.  At that point where was his 

career?
 

 

He was
 
still a  s tudent in the Con servatory conduct ing classes and  
he gave concerts in Czechoslovakia  and gave a co ncert in Karlsbat  

[Karlovy Vary].  He gave s everal  concerts in  Vie nna and then  he  

went to Fran ce an d he studied .  There he never  work ed.  He studied
 
there with Claude  Arrau. He tried  to go to the United States but 

he didn't have a  sponsor so  my m other wrote a  le tter to a  very  

famous violinist who my brother knew, Fritz Kreisler and Fritz  

Kreisler went wit h him to the cons ulate and got h im  a student v
isa  

for America and h e came here as a student.
 

 

Do you recall whe n?
 

 

 
 
 
 
14
 
Yes in '39.
 
 
In '39.Befo re t he war?
 

 

I think in August  '39.
 

 

And you were stil l in Italy?
 
 

I was in Italy.  I didn't have a s ponsor.
 

 

Still in Milan?
 
 

No.  In Rome,  Mil an, 
- 
we 
traveled . In Italy you tr aveled.
 
 

So you had work?
 
 

I had work. I al ways had work.
 
 

How about your  pa ssport?  After th e Germans took  ov er Austria, you 

voted.Were you still with an Aus trian passport or  did you...?
 
 

No, the A ustrian passport was  good till
 
the  end  of  '38.  I ha d an  
Austrian passport  as long as possi ble.
 

 

When you had to r enew your passpor t?
 

 

I renewed my pas sport.  I wrote to one of my a unts in Vienna. 

Please send me an  aryanmacher [262 ]Do  you know w hat that is?
 
 

Proof of aryan.
 
 

This is very hard when you have a Jewish father.So she sent me 

all the documents  of my mother  and  my maternal g ran dparents and my  

mother's certifi cate of matrimon y.  This was th e funniest thing 

that I got a Germ an passport with o ut a J.  I'll nev er know because
 
in this said that my father was the son of Ivor Grunbaum and 

Zara[270] geboren  Cohen.This  is really not real.  
 
 

So it was falsifi ed?
 

 

No, no I got it 
 

 

Through anybody's  help?Was it a  mistake or was it just that you 

 
 
 
 
15
 
had a nice guy?
 
 
A nice guy 
 

 

A 
nice guy, but he certainly was n't Jewish.  This was the German  
consulate?
 
 

It was the German  consulate.
 
 

In Milan.
 
 

In Milan, no,  in Rome.  He gave it  to me and  once y ou had a Germ an 

passport, you wer e okay.The Ital ians didn't ask a ny questions.
 
 

So you had  a non
-
Jewish passport  even though you r name is  still  
Jewish?
 

 

Yeah
 

 

Were there any  ch anges when the  wa r breaks out?.  Your brother is 

in the United Sta tes?
 

 

My mother was in  France and m y fat her, too.  My fa ther was in  Paris 

and my mother was  in Lyons with he r second husband.
 
 

Oh, so your pare nts had divorced .  Were they divorced before the 

anschluss?
 
 

Before, much befo re that.
 

 

Before you even w ent to Italy?
 
 

Yes, I was  seven teen when my  par ents divorced so  that must  have 

been '34.
 
 

The year Dolffus. ..
 

 

The Dolffus year,  yes.
 

 

But it had nothin g to do with Dolf fus?
 

 

No it had nothing  to do with Dolff us?
 

 

 
 
 
 
16
 
Nothing to do wit h being Jewish or  Protestant or Ca tholic?
 
 

No, in fact her s econd husband was  Jewish too.
 
 

So your mother wa s pro
- 
Jewish.
 
 

Was pro
-
Je
wish, yeah.
 
 

Did your father r emarry?
 

 

No but my mother  came with her second husband.  They went from 

Prague ... He was Czechoslovaki an nationality, lived always in 

Vienna.
 

 

Yelenek [293] is the 
 

 

Yelenek, yeah.  He and his b r other were born  in Russia, by  

coincidence becau se their father worked there for several years and 

when they applie d  for a visa  to t he United States  
- 
they cam e on 
the Russian quota  which was wide  o pen 
- 
and got  immediately a visa  
because they thou ght they were com ing on the Czecho slovakian quota
 
which was waitin g list for years.  But they didn't know that in  

American law you r nationality wh ere you were bor n and not what 

passport you hav e so these two w ere born in Odes sa and my mother  

was married to  a  Russian.  They got immediately t he visa and th ey 

came via C asablan ca because  they c ould not g o throu gh France anymore  

and could not  go to Spain.  Spain wouldn't let the m  in so they  had 

to go Casablanca  and from Casablan ca to Portugal  an d from Portugal  

they went to Cuba  and from Cuba th ey went to the Un ited States.
 
 

Do you recall whe n this was?
 
 

This must have be en '40, no '41, n o '40.
 

 

Had the Germans g one into Paris ye t? ..in the Vichy ?
 

 

No, I think befor e that.
 

 

But after the beg inning of the war ?
 

 

No they were in P aris already, the  Germans when my mother left.  My 

brother was ...
 
 

 
 
 
 
17
 
In the United Sta tes
 
 

In '39, he came i n '39
 

 

So it would have been after June o f 1940
 

 

I think so, yes. I don't quite re call.
 

 

Was it winter?
 
 

I don't recall th at.
 

 

Well, maybe we'l l remember l ater .  But anyway
 
by  1941 they  were 
here.
 

 

They were here, yeah. I think they came 1940, the end of 1940. It 

was certainly not  '41 because I th ink they came in the fall of 1940.
 
 

That would make sense.After the  Germans had occupied France but 

still the freedo m of Vichy because in Vichy you could go to 

Casablanca.
 
 

Yes.  It certainly was 1940 beca use '41 was alre ady Pearl Harbor  

and they were her e already in Pear l Harbor.
 
 

Meanwhile you're still in Italy.
 
 

I was still in It aly.
 

 

And Italy is in t he war in 1940.
 
 

It was in
 
the war.That's why  I don't recall.We could not  
correspond too  we ll then.  The mai l took very long.   I mean it was  

still possible b ecause America w as not in the wa r.  But a letter  

took months.
 
 

As a German pass port holder you were an ally of Fascist Italy in  

1940.
 

 

Yes, but the Fasc ists didn't bothe r you.
 

 

Did you get even better treatment?
 
 

 
 
 
 
18
 
No.We alway s go t good treatment.
 
 
How about the ant i
-
Jewish laws tha t Mussolini introduced.  Did  they  
have any affect o n you?
 

 

No
 

 

Were there any ex amples of anti
-
se mitism?
 
 

No I'd never seen  anti
-
semitism in  Italy.  No, neve r.
 
 

Were you working 
- 
in Rome mainly?
 
 

I was working 
- 
no, we traveled a round because in Italy you don' t  
work in a theater.You work in a  company and the company travels  

around?
 

 

And who were
 
you working with?  Were they mixed, Italians, 
foreigners?
 
 

All Italian.
 
 

So you were the o nly Austrian?
 
 

Oh, we were a cou ple of girls.
 
 

Were there others  who were Jewish besides you?
 
 

Oh yeah.
 

 

Italians as well as Austrians?
 
 

Well, Italians I  cannot tell.  We never talked about religion. 

That was never br ought up, never.
 
 

It was all acting , art.
 

 

Italians never as k you any questions.We had to g o to the police 

every six months  to renew the w ork ing permit.  They  never ask any 

questions.  
 
 

Do you recall som e of the places w here you toured?  Did you perform  

say for troops?
 

 
 
 
 
19
 
 
We did perform fo r hospitals, for veterans' hospita ls.
 

 

Italian veteran h ospitals
 

 

Italian, yeah. N ot for the German s, never.
 
 

You didn't perfor m for Germans. A fter all the Germ an 
troops...
 
 

No, we never perf ormed for German troops, no.
 
 

By this time y ou have very little  contacts with you r parents, your  

father?
 

 

Well, as soon as  the war started  in Austria they  had no contact 

with anyone outside because you could not write to America.  I 

didn't know where  my father was i n France because he left Paris 
- 
he came to  Nizza  [Nice] and t hen h e was in  hiding  f or the rest of 

the war.
 

 

But you knew you r  family was 
- 
you r mother and you r  brother 
- 
were 
safe?
 

 

I know that they were in America.
 
 

So your father wa s the only memb er  of your family  t hat you worried 

about?
 

 

Yes I was because  France was occup ied by the German s.
 

 

How did you feel about Italy being  on the same side  as Hitler?
 
 

Well we always  ha d the feeling tha t the Italians  didn't like it  too 

much 
- 
being on  the side 
- 
but  the y had very littl e  choice because 
the German troops  were already in Brenner and Musso lini was not too 

happy either I th ink.
 

 

Do you rem ember a ny specific  insta nces of It alian a ctor or ac tresses  

voicing their opi nions against Ger many or against M ussolini?
 
 

No.  You did not  voice against M ussolini too ope nly but we never  

talked about  poli tics really.   We  were glad we coul d stay there and  

we worked 
- 
polit ics was never a b ig thing with us.
 

 
 
 
 
20
 
 
Politics came to you now. Suddenl y in 1943 Italy surrendered and 

the Germans oc cu py all of Italy.  Do you remember  any changes  in 

your life then?
 
 

Yes.Of cours e, first of all the  theaters were cl osed.When th e 

Americans landed  I think in  Sicily  it was an d in Naples the Germans  

de
stroyed all th eir papers in th e consulate so t hey did not know 

who was in  Italy  o f German d escenda nts or ary an or  Je wish or no thing.  

They knew nothing .  They only cou ld go to the  pol ice stations, to  

the Questura, an d there they fou nd out where Ger man people were 

living.  But the Italians would not give the inf ormation about 

religion, never d id. To them every body was an aryan .
 

 

The Germans knew that you were whe re?
 

 

In Rome and we were called in the German consul ate and had the 

choice to return  to the Reich
 
o r work as interpret ers.  Of course 
we worked as int erpreters because  nobody wanted t o return to the  

Reich.
 

 

So you worked as an interpreter fo r the Germans?
 
 

For three, four months and there were a lot of G erman girls who 

spoke Italian an d after the war I remember the U NRRA came and we  

could get some fo od packages from the UNRRA  and all  the interpreter s  

I met there were  Jews who had wor k ed for the Germa n s just like we, 

Mimi and I and se veral others.
 
 

Did you change yo ur name at any ti me?
 

 

No because f or th e German Gru nbaum  is not  a Jewish name.  We  had an  

officer who wa s called Grunbaum  and he certain ly  was not  a Jew. 

For the Austrians  this was a Jewis h name. 
 

 

That's an interes ting difference.
 
 

Oh yes, Rosenbach  in Austria was J ewish.
 

 

And one of the leading Nazis was a  Rosenbach.
 
 

So Grunbaum was a  German Jewish na me in Austria.
 
 

 
 
 
 
21
 
In Austria it was  Jewish.
 
 

In Germany it was  a non
-
Jewish name.
 
 

Both.  There were  Jews who were called Grunbaum bu t not necessarily.
 
 

And did you look Jewish or aryan?
 
 

I 
don't know. App arently aryan eno ugh because nobod y ever asked  me  
anything.
 
 

What color eyes d id you have?
 
 

I have blue eyes.
 
 

You still do, blu e eyes and your h air was....?
 
 

Red at the time.  But anyway the Italians didn't give out any 

information. The y saved a lot of people, I must sa y.
 

 

Do you know of pe ople who were sav ed.
 

 

Oh yes, at least  all of them who  w orked with me the re.  I know of 

a lot of people who were in Italy and everybody will tell you the 

same.The It alia ns did not give o ut information to  the Germans.
 
 

Now in Rome as  yo u know in late  19 43 there were s om e deportations.  

The Germans attem pted to deport It alian Jews to Aus chwitz.  Did yo u 

witness any of th ese incidents?
 
 

No, but I know w here it happened  in Largo Argent ina but I didn't  

see it
 
myself, thank goodness.
 
 

Did you know of a nybody who was se nt away?
 

 

I didn't know any body, no.
 
 

How about inciden ts of armed resis tance.  For exa mp le in March 1944 

there was a majo r  partisan attack  on the SS and  the n there was the 

retaliation.
 
 

The 
retaliation.  Three hundred in  the catac ombs.  I remember  that 
because I lived v ery near where th is attack took pl ace.
 

 
 
 
 
22
 
 
Did you ever have occasion to see or meet Colonel Kappler, the 

commandant.
 
 

No, I never saw h im but I know who  he was.Who did n't know?
 
 

Was it a name tha t inspired trust and love or..?
 
 

No, hate.  He was  terrible.  Every  day, this was in '44 just before 

the war ended, t hey had some Ame rican and Englis h prisoners and 

they would parade  them and the Am ericans would go with the V sig n  

and the Italians applauded.
 
 

The Italians app l auded the Americ a n prisoners that  were paraded by 

the Germans in Ro me.Were you  eve r in danger?
 
 

Well, I don't thi nk so.I was  not  really in danger .
 

 

And you didn't ha ve to hide?
 
 

Yes, in the last  few weeks,  I di d hide because  I  was afraid  that 

they would take m e with them when the Germans left Rome.
 

 

So you were an i nterpreter for th ree or four month s and then wha t  

did you do after? You kind of  dre w away?
 

 

No, I was pregnan t at the time and  could quit work in May,
 
1944 and 
then I ha d a  very  nice bos s I  must  say and  he  calle d me up  and  said 

go in hiding bec ause they are coming to get you.   Because they 

wanted gentile pe rsons, everybody,  to go with them up north and o f  

course I didn't w ant to go.
 
 

That was the ori ginal choice as I recall.  Either return to the  

Reich or work as an interpreter?
 
 

But there they wa nted us to go,  al l interpreters, t o go north with  

the troops and I didn't want to do  that.
 

 

And why was thi s sudden renewed  interest in go ing north.  Was  

anything happenin g near Rome?
 
 

Oh yeah, the Amer icans.
 

 

 
 
 
 
23
 
The Americans  ent ered.  You probab ly remembered the  date that  they 
entered?
 

 

Yes, June 4, 1944 .
 

 

So you hid just b efore June 4, 194 4.
 

 

Yes, about ten da ys before.
 
 

And then what happened after the Americans came?  Did you have 

work?
 

 

Oh yeah, at first  I returned to th e theater and then I worked as an 

interpreter for t he Americans unti l '48.
 

 

By then you must have known quite a few languages.  You started out  

being German spea king..
 

 

Yes, I spoke Ital ian and English. I learned Englis h in school.
 
 

You learned Engli sh when you were in Vienna before going to Italy?
 
 

In school, yeah.
 
 

So you would  be i nterpreting betwe en the America ns and the Italia ns  

or between the Am ericans and Germa n prisoner?
 
 

No, between Ameri cans and Italians .
 

 

And they paid you ?
 

 

They paid me,  sur e.  And then we w ent to Argentina ,  my husband  and 

I.
 

 

So you had marrie d in Italy.
 
 

Yes.
 

 

Had a child?
 
 

This one. [Daught er was present at  interview]
 
 

Born as an Italia n citizen.
 

 
 
 
 
24
 
 
No, as an Austria n citizen.
 
 

Male, female?
 
 

Female, name Iren e.
 

 

Your husband was also Austrian?
 
 

No my husband was  German.
 

 

Jewish, non
-
Jewis h?
 
 

Non
-
Jewish.
 
 

He was in Italy a t the time?
 
 

He was in Italy at the time.Was a prisoner and we left for 

Argentina in 1 94 8 because we  did n't have a visa for the states . 

There was a long waiting period.
 
 

He was a prisoner of the Americans but he had been there a German 

military?
 
 

Military, yes.
 
 

Any word from yo ur brother, mean while?.  Your brother was in the 

United State
s.
 
 

My brother was i n the United Sta tes and of cours e I didn't hear 

from him during t he war because y o u could not writ e  but as soon  as 

the war was over,  no, not as soon , because you cou ldn't write fo r  

quite some time .  But one day he  c ame to visit  me.  In '45 he came  

in September.  He  was then  station ed in the  third a rmy in Shongau,  

Germany.
 

 

He visited you in  Italy.
 

 

In Italy, in Rome .
 

 

And you hadn't se en him since when ?
 

 

Since 1937, eight  years.A lo t of  time.
 

 
 
 
 
25
 
 
Can you recollect  what he was doin g between 1939 an d 1945 when you  

finally saw him?
 
 

Yes, he was in New York.  He studie d with Schnabel, Arthur Schnabel, 

the pianist.  He  gave concerts.  He taught.  He worked with a 

Russian singer, s tudied with her, accompanied her.  And then he was 

drafted in the a rmy.  Well he was not drafted, he was a student 

here so they gave  him a choice.
 
 

What was the choi ce?
 

 

The choice was to  join the army or  have to leave th e country.
 
 

And return where?
 
 

That is the quest ion.
 

 

What kind of  citi zenship did he  ha ve at that  point? .  He obviously 

was not an Americ an citizen.
 
 

No, he was German , I guess.
 
 

German, so were t hey threatening t o return him to G ermany?.
 

 

Well, they would not return him an ywhere.  He j ust has to leave the 

country and try  t o find another  co untry which wou ld  take him.  But 

he has a choice t o join the  army w hich he did.  Firs t he was i n North  

Carolina, I think  was his boot cam p and several oth ers.
 

 

Did he serve in E urope before he s aw you?
 

 

Yeah, because  he came in '44  to Eu rope and he  came  to visit me in 

'45.  And just a month before he  d ied, he was kille d, an accident,  

we don't know.
 
 

He was killed a m onth after you la st saw him?
 
 

Yes
 

 

Do you recall  him  telling any  stor ies, any dramatic  experiences as  

a soldier?.  Did  he describe the  fighting?  Did he describe what  

he saw in Germany , perhaps concent ration camps?
 

 
 
 
 
26
 
 
Yes he told me  h e saw concentrati on camps.  He sa id everyone they  

interviewed never  heard of Nazis. Nobody was ever a Nazi.
 

 

He served in the US army.Was  he attached to a par ticular unit?
 
 

Yes,
 
intelligence .And he was  an interpreter.
 
 

So in some ways y ou had similar  jo bs.  And his expe rience was that  

no German...?
 
 

Ever was Nazi.
 
 

Did he believe?  What were his fee lings towards the  Germans?
 
 

No.  Well was no t enthusiastic ab out the Germans .  He didn't feel  

any hatred, I think.  That was not  in his character.  All he wanted 

was to go back to America, resum e his career as a musician.  He 

didn't think he could be a pianist anymore because three years of 

not practicing t he piano daily m akes your finger s stiff but he 

wanted to go into  conducting becau se he had the qualification to be 

a conductor.But  music was his life.He was supposed to go home 

on November 19, 1 945.  On the eigh teenth of November he told one of 

his friends that he was going tosee Richard Strauss in Garmisch
-

Partnkirchen and  he left early i n the morning an d was never seen 

alive again.
 
 

Do you know what happened to him?
 
 

We only k now what  the army  told  us , that he  had  an a ccident.  Tha t's  

what they said  at  the time.  But n ot right
 
away.  H e was listed  as  
missing because n obody knew where  he was and  it was November and  it 

started snowing a nd they could not  search anymore for him and after 

the snow melted,  my sister
-
in
-
law  got a letter  that  he was found in 
Mittenwald with a  fractured
 
skull.  And that is al l we know.And  
at first he was buried in Metz and then I think the French wanted 

this cemetery to  be eliminated s o my sister
-
in
-
l aw got a letter 
where she wanted  him buried and she said in New York and that's 

where he is, in F armingdale, the m ilitary cemetery.
 
 

Do you have any  o pinions as t o how  and why  he mig ht  have died  and 

why the military was so secretive?
 
 

 
 
 
 
27
 
I don't know.  I  only know that  m y brother told m e  when he was in 
Rome that the Germans always thou ght when he interviewed s
omebody  

that he was also the one who passe s judgment which was not the case.   

He was only the interpreter.And he said the Germans if you have  

a uniform think you're a general. You have so much  to say, which 

he didn't.  But I always thoug ht it had  somethin g to do  with the  

Germans, that it was not an accident.  He was not a mountain 

climber.  He lik ed to take  a wa lk in the woods  but not i n the  

mountains.  He never did that be fore, why should  he have done it  

the day before he  had to leave?
 
 

And then you even tually came to th e United States?
 
 

I came to the Un ited States much  later because m y mother was our  

sponsor, but the  Austrian quota was impossible, v ery, very small. 

I could go on the German quota with my husband, because he was born 

in Germany.  So w e'r
e in Argentina  and we finally got the visa in 

1950.  We were su pposed to leave o n September 13.  On September  12  

came the McCarren [674] Act and we already had the luggage aboard 

and we were called to come to the consulate, which we did and the 

consulate asked  t o see our  passpor t.  We gave him t he passport and  

he put in "cancel ed."  
 

 

Why?
 

 

Because my husban d was born in  a t otalitarian count ry.  And  at th is  

time there was th e McCarren Act th at nobody in a  co untry which had 

at one time a to talitarian regime  could go to the  United States. 

So we had to sta y in Argentina.  I remembered th at Truman vetoed  

this and so I wen t to the  consulat e once a  week.   T he poor c onsulate  

when he saw m e al ready, "No, no  vi sa yet."  And we got our visa on 

May of 1951 andleft and we came to the United States on May 28, 

1951.
 

 

Looking back on y our experiences a nd thinking of your career in the 

theater and actin g..
 

 

It was not much o f a career
 
 

If you had to select the most dramatic moment of your life at least 

during the time o f
 
the war what wo uld you..
 
 

The most dramatic  I think was when  we were in Rhode s 
 

 
 
 
 
28
 
and I still had m y Austrian passpo rt.  While I was in Rhodes  I met  
two Viennese men  who told me the ir story that th ey came over the  

border into Italy because they had an American visa and wanted to 

go to the States but the Germans wouldn't give them an exit visa so 

they went somewhere over the border and came to Italy without the 

visa and register ed in a  hotel.   B ut the clerk brou ght the p assport  

to the police an d they saw they  had no visa and they were not 

allowed to traver se Italy anymore and you cannot go to America from 

Venice. So they went on the first boat to Egypt and thought they  

could go from th ere and then the y told me the story that Egypt 

wouldn't let the m go ashore
 
and they came back t o Italy and they  
wouldn't let them  go ashore and th ey traveled back and forth.
 
 

You're in Rhodes  and these peopl e are traveling back and forth 

without the visa?
 
 

They're also in R hodes and once th e Governor of Rho des was on th e  

boat and he wasa Jew himself and he let them stay for awhile in 

Rhodes.  He gave them permission t o get off the boa t and they  were 

trying to get a v isa to Egypt  whic h they final ly got.  They  told me  

the story and when we came back to Italy in Bari [710] and we w
anted 

to go ashore because (actually we traveled to Venice but we stood 

a day in Bari  and  I was with t his English ballet an d all the girls  

got their passpor t back except me so I said, "Where's my passport?"  

So I went in and this Italian said I'm sorry you
 
cannot get to shore 
because you are J ewish and Jews ca nnot enter Italy anymore.
 

 

This is an Italia n official.
 
 

An Italian offici al.
 

 

In which year. D o you remember th e year?
 

 

'39.  No excuse me, '38.  After the Anschluss.  I still had the  

Austrian passport  hadn't expi red.   I said I'm no t Jewish and  my  

passport is still  okay til l the  end of the  year.  And he sa id but  

if you were not Jewish you would have already chan ged it like al l  

the others did.  And so I  remember  that I  voted  and this was stamped  

into the passpor t.  And first I did not remembe r it.  I was so  

nervous I saw my self going back and forth on thi s boat like the 

people told me.  Oh, G
-
d, what am I going to do?  And then I 
remembered.  I vo ted and I  have th at in the  passpor t.  And as soon  

as he saw that he  said oh I'm sorr y and he gave me the visa.
 

 
 
 
 
29
 
So I remembered t he man at the con sulate.He was r ight.
 
 

So your decision  to vote for the N azis saved you.  This would have  

been after Musso lini enacted the anti
-
Jewish laws.  This was why  
they gave you a hard time.  But these are the It alians that are 

giving you troubl e.
 

 

Yes, well I'm Italian.But it didn't last very long.As soon as 

they saw this sta mp, I could  go in  and in  Rome th ey  never gave me 

trouble.
 

 

And then you got the German passpo rt without a J.
 
 

I got it  without  a J. That I  th ink was my  most dramatic moment  

because I really  saw myself on t he boat going ba ck and forth to 

Rhodes.
 

 

And no amount of acting could have  saved you, just quick thinking.
 
 

Yes
 

 

If your brother  w ere here and ha d to answer the s am e question what 

do you think his answer would be b ased on his exper iences.
 

 

I don't know. H e had a lot of  dram atic experiences in Germany when  

he was a soldier because he told methat one day there was a terrible 

bombardment.  He said I was hung ry, I was going into the kitchen  

and everybody sai d don't be cra zy.   You're not goi ng out when th e 

bombs are firing and he said, "Yes, I'm going out." And he went out 

of the barracks  w here they were  st aying and into  the next one  where 

the kitchen is  an d
 
the barracks  wh ere they were sta ying was bombed 
and he was the on ly survivor.
 
 

By American aircr aft.
 

 

No, by the German s.
 

 

Germany still had  an air force.
 
 

Yes they still ha d an air force.
 
 

How about befo re  he left  Vienna.   You say that  h e left after  the 

Anschluss.  D o yo u remember him ha ving any bad expe riences with the 

 
 
 
 
30
 
Nazis in Vienna?
 
 
Yes.  In the cons ervatory he was  t hen nineteen yea r s old so h e was 

thirteen years a  student in the  conservatory.  This professor  

Nielius [759]  who  was a  teacher  fo r the c
onductingclasses.  And he  

was always a  star  pupil and  he al w ays talked a bout him.  As  soon as  

the Nazis came in  he wouldn't let him into the buil ding anymore.
 
 

So he was expelle d from the Vienna  conservatory?
 
 

Oh yes.
 

 

No more concerts.
 
 

No more.  Not hing
. 
 

Did he have his o wn piano.
 
 

Oh yes.
 

 

So when your fami ly left Vienna?
 
 

They left everyth ing.
 

 

You owned your ow n home?
 

 

No, they rented.
 
 

And when you went  to Italy  in 19 37  did you  have a ny  idea that  you 

would never retur n?
 

 

No, of course not .
 

 

Did you have anyt hing from your ch ildhood?
 

 

No, nothing.  Jus t my clothes, som e clothes, not  ev en everything. 

But I sometimes h ad the feelin g that I would  never come back bec ause  

I was convinced that Hitler would come to Austria and many people 

did not believe m e
. 

 

What made you thi nk that?
 

 

I don't know.
 

 
 
 
 
31
 
 
Just a wild hunch .
 

 

I don't think it  was such a wild  hunch.  I think it was in the 

stars that he wou ld come but peopl e didn't want to believe it.  The 

Austrian Jews di d not want to be lieve that it co uldn't happen in 

Vienna. I don't k now why they  don' t believe it .  T here was a  lot of  

anti
-
semitism the re and Austria w as very poor at the time.  They 
had a lot of une mployed people.  Austria was ver y poor and they 

thought that  an A nschluss to  Germa ny would 
- 
becaus e everybody  heard  
that since Hitler is the Germanshave more work and everything is 

going better 
--
 
 

So there was econ omic hope in Germ any.  Was he popu lar?  Did peo ple 

admire Hitler?
 
 

None of my friend s admired him but  certainly a lot of people did.
 
 

And you
 
recal l th e reasons tha t wh y they admire d hi m. What was  there  
about him that th ey liked?
 
 

They thought that when Hitler will come they will all work, 

everything will b e better.  This did not last v ery  long because I 

don't think he tr eated the Austria ns too
 
we ll.  He was an Au strian,  
but he didn't lik e Austria.
 
 

Now you, being  in  Italy must ha ve been interesting vantage port in  

that Italy had be en the ally of Au stria.
 

 

Yes, for a long time Dolffus' widow as a matter of fact was in Italy 

at the time and S chuschnigg was in  Italy. 
 

 

You remember what  the Italian reac tion was to the A nschluss?
 
 

The Italians did n't like it at a ll.  They had ve ry little choice  

because Hitler's army was on the Brenner pass alrea dy at that time.  

As a matter of fact Hitler came to Italy, I think, in '38 right  

after the Anschl uss.  I remember because I was l iving in a hotel  

with another Vie n nese who was also  Jewish and  we were called to  the 

police and held t here the whole da y.  They were very friendly to us 

but they were afr aid that people w ould do s omething  to Hitler.  B ut  

I remember that M ussolini did not come to greet him .  Just the ki ng 

greeted him and Mussolini never came because he didn't care too

much for Hitler b ut he had very li ttle choice.
 
 
On the other hand  the king cared e ven less.
 
 

The king cared even less but the king was not a very strong 

personality, it s eemed.
 

 

Do you have  any o ther recollection s that you  would like to tell  us.   

Anything that we' ve forgotten?
 
 

Right offhand  I d on't remember  any thing. Maybe late r on I  will  think  

of something then  I will let you k now.
 

 

Well, thank you.
