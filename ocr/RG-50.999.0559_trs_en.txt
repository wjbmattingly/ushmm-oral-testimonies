to Munkac s.
 
 
In May

In 1947, the girls and their  
Aunt Ros e, who had been with them thr oughout the tim e in the 
c am ps, immigrated to New York. This  photogr aph s hows  them  upon their  ar r ival in the United
 
States .
 
 
 
After arr iving in the United States  and living in New Yor k, Ir ene m et and marr ied Marty Weis s

Sc hool s ys tem. She taught m iddle
-
s c hool students  fr om many c ountr ies.
 
          
 
Ir ene's  hus band Marty pass ed away in J anuar y of 2013. Marty, who was  93, was  a c om bat 
veter an of the Sec ond World War s eeing ac tion in Nor th Afric a, Italy and els ewhere in Europe. He had 
a long and distinguis hed c ar eer as  a geologis t with the feder al government. Irene and Marty wer e

Ir ene and Marty have three c hildr en, four  grandc hildren, and one gr eat gran
dc hild
. 
Her 
daughter, Les ley, is here today.
 
She is  in the front row r ight next to Irene.
 
          
 
Ir ene bec ame a volunteer for this  mus eum five years  ago and this  is her fifth tim e s peaking as

a mem ber of the U.S. Delegation to the 

70th Annivers ary Commemor ation of the Liberation of Aus c hwitz
. 
In J uly 2015 Irene tr aveled to 
Germ any with her daughter, Lesley, to be pr es ent at the tr ial of form er SS m em ber  Oskar  Gr oening 

who was a guar d at Ausc hwitz. Ir ene was a c o
-
plaintiff in the trial of Gr oening and again in February 
2016 at the trial of SS member Reinhold Hanning. Her tes timony at Hanning's  trial was  featur ed in 
the 
m os t r ec ent is s ue of "Time" m agazine.
 
 
With that, I would like you to join m e in welc oming our Firs t Pers on, Ir ene Weis s.
 
 
Thank  you, Ir ene.
 
 
Ir ene, thank you s o m uch for  being willing to be our  fir s t pers on and s pend this  hour  with us. 
We c ould k eep you hear all ever yone. We'll get you go at the end of the in hour , s o we'll star t.
 
 
Ir ene, you des cribed for me the tim e for  you and your  fam ily in Czec hos lovakia, before the 
Holoc aus t, as  a tim e of hard work  but als o a good life, one in whic h ther e was  in your  wor ds , a s ens e of 
s afety. Befor e we turn to the war  years, tell us about your
 
family and your life in thos e years  befor e the 
war in Czec hos lovakia.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s: Well, I lived in a s m all town, a farming town, population only 1,000. Everybody knew 

ever ybody els e. My fam ily was  fr iends with the neighbors. I had a lot of girlfriends  in s c hool. We 
m ingled. We got along well. We vis ited with eac h other. It was  a peac eful tim e.
 
 
My father and m other s pent their  tim e wor king pretty hard. Ther e was  a lot of religious  
obs er vanc e in our family. We wer e looking forward to the us ual s eas ons  
and good tim es the c hildren 
had. So bas ic ally it was  a norm al c hildhood.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little about your s iblings.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  There were s ix c hildren in our fam ily r anging from 7 to 17. It was  ver y hard work  for  
m y parents  to r ais e the c
hildren
. In
 
thos e days , c hildr en didn't have the m edic al c are. My parents  were 
very wor ried about the s lightes t fever bec aus e ther e was  no penicillin and things  that help today.
 
So my mother was  the kind who worr ied a lot and hover ed over  us.We were ver y m uc h loved. Our 
father was  a gentle and kind, hands
-
on father .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How large was  your extended fam ily?
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  My gr andpar ents lived in the near by town, just a few kilometer s  away. That was  m y 

m other 's parents. They had s ever al young adult children, aunts  and unc les. Vis iting them was  the 
greatest pleas ur e. We would s pend the night or a weekend ther e. There was  a lot of fam ily events  and 
a lot of good tim es for the c hildren.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you des c r ibed your grandfather's  plac e as  a m agic al plac e when you were kids.
 

3 
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. He had a s umm er  plac e in the m ountainous  ar ea. The grandc hildr en would be 
inv ited to s pend the s umm er vac ations  ther e. The whole ter rain there was different, mountains  and 
b
r ooks, and differ ent kinds  of fr uits, berr ies that we pic ked and s o on. It was  jus t a norm al, happy 
c hildhood. We wer e ver y, ver y m uc h loved. We felt that at all tim es.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e going to tell us  later a little bit m ore about your aunts , Ros e and 
P ir i
. 
Tell us  
about them at this tim e. They were part of your life as  a c hild.
 
> > IreneWeis s:  Ver y muc h. They wer e two young wom en.When we wer e deported to Aus c hwitz, they 

were in their  20s. They took  over  being s ubs titutive par ents  to m e and m y s is ter.
 
 
V is i
ting them, we address ed them  in kind of a adult way, like Aunt Ros e, and Aunt 
Piri
, and 
never just, you k now
 
--
 
they wer e very impor tant to us as  the gr ownups  we would emulate.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  By the tim e Germ any invaded Poland in Septem ber
 
1939, of c our s
e launc hing World 
War II, by that tim e your  c om munity had alr eady experienc ed profound c hange. Hungar y was  an ally of 
Nazi Ger many. And ear lier , 1939, befor e the invas ion of Poland, your comm unity had been invaded or 
oc c upied by the Ger mans
 
--
 
by the Hunga
rians
, e
xc us e m e
, w
hic h imm ediately c hanged your  lives . 
What happened once you wer e under  Hungarian rule?
 

> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes.Well, we wer e under Czec hos lovakian r ule. And they wer e m or e acc epting of the 
differ ent kinds of people in their c om munity. Hungar y invaded our  ar ea, their anti
-
Sem itis m cam e to the 
floor. They m ade m any rules  and laws  to is olate the Jewis h population and s o we wer e s ubjected to all 
kinds of restr ictions . The law did not pr otect us  anymore. J ewis h c hildr en c ould not attend Hungar ia
n 
s c hools . The dis c r imination es c alated as  m ore and mor e the gover nm ent gave the population 

per mis s ion to dis cr iminate. It c om es  fr om the top, the people quickly pick it up. So there wer e suc h 
things as invas ion of our homes  by s o
-
c alled hoodlums  but all they had to do was  put on a s was tika 
band and they s eem ed to be deputized to be in charge of the law.
 
And s o we were alr eady afraid and 
we wer e alr eady worr ied about our s afety.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e about a very fr ightening inc ident with your  father
 
on the tr ain. 
Can y
ou tell 
us  about that? 
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. It was  a very frightening experienc e. I was  on the train with m y father going home 
fr om  m y grandparents' town, about a five
-
m inute train r ide, r eally. He was  rec ognized as  probably a 
J ewis h 
per s on bec aus e he had a s m all beard, the kind that is  ver y popular  and c ommon right now but 
at the tim e religious J ewis h men wer e probably the only ones  who had bear ds . So thes e young m en on 

the tr ain dec ided that they would have s om e fun. They s urr ounded him  and me and began to m ake 
jokes about
,  
"What s hall we do with him " and
, 
"Wouldn't it be fun to thr ow him off the tr ain." They had a 
big laugh over it. They approac hed c los er and c los er .
 
 
In the m eantim e, the r est of the pas s enger s  didn't s ay anything or
 
m ak
e a move towards  
p
r otecting him. I was  with him  but I was  jus t the obs er ver and abs olutely ter rified, looking out the 
window to s ee how c lose we ar e to hom e, when the tr ain would s top. 
 
 
And ac tually that's  what saved m y father bec ause the tr ain stopped and we quic kly got off.
 
It was  the fir st ver y terrifying experienc e where he felt the kind of fun that young people would have with 

an older  per s on just becaus e he was  J ewis h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And they c ould get away with it.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  They c ould 
get away with it and no one ros e to say anything. And, of c ours e, I, as the 
c hild of, you know, with m y father, I was  abs olutely ter rified. My father never rode the tr ain again after 

that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Als o during that tim e he los t his  bus ines s , didn't
 
he?
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. Ver y s oon after that J ewis h bus ines s es  wer e c onfis cated and given to non
- Jews. 
So, yes , his lumber yard, whic h he had for years  and made a sm all living, not fantastic
; m
ainly he s old 
lum ber, c onstr uction material to farmer s
, i
t wa
s  c onfis c ated, not paid for. So he now s at at home doing 
nothing m uc h, helping with the c hores in the house. But his  inc ome s topped and there were s ix c hildren 
to take care of.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did you manage to eat? 
 

4 
 
> > Ir eneWeis s: Well, it was  a ver y s c ary. My mother gr ew a garden, a r ather large gar den. It bec am e 
par t of her daily job to make s ure that the food was  gr owing. Buying food fr om the farm ers  or  
exc hanging things  for food. But this  c ould not have las ted very long bec aus e s ix c hildr en need
 
a lot of 
taking c ar e of.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Moving for ward a little bit, in 1942, your father , along with thous ands  of other J ewish 
m en, were for c ed by the Hungar ians to do forc ed labor for the military. Tell us  about your father's  

c ons c r iption, for c ed c ons
c r iption, into a labor  brigade and what that meant to your fam ily.
 
> > IreneWeis s: Well, it was  very fr ightening. We heard about young men being c alled in to a labor 

br igade. Ther e was  a war  on. And, of c ours e, J ews
 
--
 
they wer e not s oldiers . They wer e no
t given guns . 
They were just us ed for really fr ont line, dangerous  mine c lear ing and heavy work . And they wer e 

heavily abus ed bec aus e they wer e not treated as s oldier s . It was  r eally s lave labor . And a lot of them  

were injur ed. A lot of them  never c am e back . It was a terribly s c ar y thing for the head of the family to be 
taken away and then forc ed to do the kind of wor k  he was n't tr ained for and the dis r es pect and the 
danger  that went with it. So we wer e very frightened.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And jus t to r epeat something you s aid
; t
hey were for ced to do things like walk in the 

fields to c lear for m ines .
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ahead of the s oldier s.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Right. Right. So they wer e in great danger. By the end of the war  it was  quite c lear
 
that the largest per c entage of them never c am e bac k . They wer e killed.
 
 
It so happened that at that par tic ular time they still had s ome r egar d for  men who were
 
--
 
m y 
father was  40
-
s omething and had s ix c hildren. So after a while, s ix months or s o, he was  s ent back . But 
the younger men wer e k ept until the end of the war  if they s ur vived.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e nearly 12 at that tim e. Do you rem em ber your father leaving for  the forced 
labor  and c om ing back  hom e
? What 
was  like for you when he c am e home?
 
>>
 
Ir eneWeis s: Well, yes . Our family was  alr eady in big tr ouble becaus e our  father  not only los t his  
bus ines s  and c ouldn't provide but now he phys ic ally was  r emoved from us  without any kind of 
knowledge that he'll be taken c are of or that he will c ome bac
k
. So m y
 
m other  was  dis tr aught. It was  a 
terr ible time for  us.
 
 
When he c ame back , his bear d had been s haved. The c hildren bar ely rec ognized him 
bec aus e that's  the only way we knew him.
 
He was  very s ubdued, ver y quiet. He did not tell us about 
what happened
 
to him . It was  obvious  that he had a ver y terr ible experienc e. But we wer e s o gr ateful 
that he c am e hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would c ontinue, of c our se, under thos e c ir c ums tanc es
,  
until ear ly in 1944. As  
diffic ult as life was  for J ews  under  the Hungarian r ule, it tur ned dr am atic ally and tr agic ally wor s e in 

1944 when the Germ ans invaded Hungar y. Tell us  about that tim e and what it m eant for  the Germans  
to move into Hungar y and why they did that in Marc h
 
1944.
 
>>
 
Ir eneWeis s:  Hungary was  allied with Germ any but by 1944, the Germans  wer e los ing the war  and 
the Hungarian gover nm ent realized that they might be on the los ing end of this  war s o they attempted 

to pull out of the allianc e. Germ any would have none of it.
 
So they ac tually invaded a former ally and 
we bec am e under German Nazi r ule. 
 
 
And that c hanged ever ything. Bec aus e although life was  diffic ult under  the Hungar ians , we 
los t our c ivil r ights and freedoms  and opportunities  to m ak e a living and go to s c hool
 
and all of that, but 
we wer e in our hom es and we were s till a unit, a family. It never oc c urr ed to us that we c ould be evic ted 
fr om  our  hom e and fr om our  c ountry. My father and his  father wer e c itizens  of Hungar y.We wer e 

c omfortable with the idea that we
 
were not going to be deported. However, as  s oon as the Germ an 
Ar m y arr ived in the general ar ea, in our town, they ins tigated, instituted, the Nur em berg Laws  where 

J ews  los t all of their r ights  and all of their pr otec tion.
 
And not only that but within s om ething like three 
weeks  after the Germ ans  occ upied our  area, they began to deport people. They began to c ollec t Jews  

into ghettos in preparation to m ove them out of the c ountr y. That's what happened to us .
 

5 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were about 14. Do you rem ember
 
the Germ ans actually com ing in
? 
I think you told 
m e a little bit about that, that the Hungarians  were c elebrating the arrival of the Germ ans.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. I remember very c learly. The main road going through the town, the loc al 
population lined the s treet with jugs of wine waiting for  them while they were still out of s ight. And then 
when you hear d the marc hing of the boots and coming, they wer e c heering and ther e was  c elebration. 
And they rang the c hurch bell.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They rang the c hur c
h bell?
 
> > IreneWeis s:  Yes. Actually, a huge Arm y m arched through the town. They wer e given wine and 

food. And then they marc hed thr ough to the next town. But the flavor  of what's to c ome r emained with 
us  bec aus e we realized
 
that the people 
welc om ed them. It was  always  m or e fear  and terr or  and lack  of 
perfection whic h for a fam ily with c hildr en, if the law abandons  you and you ar e thr own at the m er cy of 
thes e people who now obvious ly don't want you, it's really a terr ifying event.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm s ur
e for most of us  in this
 
r oom
, m e inc luded, that is  unimaginable, that kind of fear.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Unimaginable. I agree. If the law pr otec ts you, you are luc ky.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you wer e beginning to tell us, they began r ounding up the J ews . And within jus t a 

few weeks  you wer e for ced into a ghetto.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes.Within a few weeks  the announc ement was  m ade in our  town that we s hould 

gather at kind of a City Hall ar ea and bring jus t one s uitc as e each and leave our hom e. My par ents, m y 

m other  
began to bake food, br ead and things that s he c ould take for  feeding the c hildren no m atter 
wher e they will end up, wher e we will end up. Nobody ever  told us  where we were going or  whether  we 

were c om ing back  or what will happen to us.
 
 
So we all gather ed into this  Town Hall area. All the other  J ewish families in the town als o 
ar r ived there. And now all of them were in this  one plac e.We wer e on the floor  of this  Town Hall plac e. 

They were c alling the m en. Ther e was  an offic e to where the loc al gendarm e and
 
loc al offic ials  wer e in 
one of the offic e r ooms. They dem anded from  m y father that he hand over his  m oney and valuables . 

They were thr eatening him . They told him that they know he m ust have mor e than he gave them .
 
He c ame back  s aying that he was  r oughed up and r oughly treated.
 
 
So very s oon after that, loc al trans portation arr ived.We wer e put into these wagons . All the 
c hildren and all the elderly, ever ybody, driven to the near est big town wher e they s et up a huge ghetto, 
not jus t for our town but the towns people, the J ews , fr om all over villages and towns . There wer e 
s om ething like 12,000 people in this  one plac e. It was  a big fac tor y with huge gr ounds and s om e kind of 
buildings  for the pr oc es s ing and building
 
--
 
m aking of the br icks.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  12,000 Jews  in the s urrounding buildings  in this one plac e.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  In one plac e w
ithout any fac ilities, no fac ilities for hygiene. Ever ybody was  on the floor 
of thes e barr acks , s ick  people, old people, pregnant women, newborns
. E
verybody huddled tog
ether  on 
the floor  without any kind of fac ilities , no water, no toilet fac ilities , no food fac ilities .
 
 
So we s oon s ee that things will be too har d to bear . And yet, at ever y s tep of the way we s till 
looked to s ee what was  s till ok , what we c an still bear.
 
And one of the things that was  still ok
,  
that the 
family was  together
 a
nd that perhaps  this  is temporary and it c an't be anything but tem por ar y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So was  ther e hope that you m ight r etur n back to your homes  that you had left behind?
 
>> Ir ene
 
Weis s:  Yes.We felt it was  s ome kind of an aberr ation, that s om ebody will c om e to their 
s ens es . What do you do with 10,000 or m or e people here, with all the needs
? 
And we're s till c los e to 
hom e. We'r e s till together.
 
> > Bill Bens on: While you were in the Munkac s  Ghetto, in the brick factor y, I believe you told me you 

were s haved at that point.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes.Well, life was  ver y diffic ult. Life was  just on the verge of being im pos s ible. People 
were s ic k. Childr en wer e unhappy and s o on. And then als o hygiene was  so ter rible that or iginally the 
or der that the gir ls under 16 s hould have their  hair c ut s eemed to be a hygiene thing. And although 
dr as tic, I ran into the plac e and s at down, I had my br aids  c ut. I didn't even ask m y mother for 
per mis s ion or

Ever y announc em ent, every or der was  followed by, "You will be punis hed" or "Your father will 
be beaten." That was  their  favor ite way. They often c alled in the m en for ques tioning and beating and 
having the kind of fun that t
hey thought was  appropr iate to humiliate m en in par tic ular. So I was  terrified 
that m y father  would s uffer  as a r es ult.
 
 
So my poor m other, s he gave me a k er c hief to put on. I even
 
--
 
I was  13 year s  old at the tim e. 
I s om ehow under s tood that this  is n't the
 
wors t thing. It's  bad but hair will grow out. Always , you don't 
totally give in to des pair, hoping, hoping.
 

 
It tur ned out, I had no idea, never im agined, that that thing
 
--
 
I arr ived in Aus c hwitz s oon after 
with the ker c hief on m y head and no hair . It made m e look  older. It made me look  like s om e of the 

m arried women who als o c overed their  heads after  they m arr ied, only jus t women. So bec aus e of that 
m y age was n't evident that I was  13. And when the family was  tor n apart at the ar rival in Aus c hwitz, 

s epar
ated, I was  deemed to be old enough for s lave labor and I had the fir s t c hanc e to s urvive t
he 
s elec tion of who s hould live and who s hould die.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about going to Ausc hwitz. You wer e in the Munkacs  Ghetto for about three 
weeks  and then 
all of you wer e depor ted to Aus chwitz by train
, n
ot knowing wher e you wer e going. Tell 
us  about that.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  After three weeks , you know, or der s  barked, announc ements . The announc em ent was  
a train was  on the prem is es . There was  a r ailr oad at the factor y ther e.We didn't know a train c ould 

ar r ive ther e right ins ide to take us to the next place. So this  long tr ain with c attle c ars, a fr eight train, 
ar r ived. Announc em ents wer e bar k ed all over  the loud s peakers to get your  belongings  and get into the 
tr ain, gr eat haste, you know, a lot of har s h or ders . So m y par ents grabbed the kids and the belongings 
and we headed for the train. We were pus hed in ther e with like 60 to 80 people into a c attle c ar, again 
s itting on the floor. The m en would go to one s ide for  m odes ty s ak e and the women on the other side.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And thes e wer e ver y s m all c attle c ars.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Ver y sm all. It was  totally pac ked. And then they put a buc ket in the m iddle for the 

toilet. And, again, nobody tells  you where you'r e going. Nobody tells  you what's  going to happen to you. 
At every s tep ther e ar e no fac ilities  for or dinar y needs . Again, there are lots of c hildr en, lots  of old 
people, lots of people with imm ediate needs. Totally ignored. So we wer e los ing a little more
 
hope as  to 
what's  happening to us bec aus e we are actually now being taken out of our sur roundings. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Going to s om e unknown
 
--
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Unknown plac e with an unknown fate.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The train s topped at Aus c hwitz. We s aw that
 
photograph, whic h is  an extr aordinary 
photogr aph
,  
whic h s hows  you after you've gotten off, out of the boxc ar. Take a little time jus t to tell us  
about that photogr aph, how you even have that.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s: Well, when we ar r ived in Aus c hwitz, the doors  
opened from  the outs ide. They wer e 

yelling get out, get out and leave ever ything behind. So now we have nothing.
 
Lots of s houting. Again, 
m en to one s ide, wom en and c hildren to the other. My father and 16
-
year
-
old br other lined up with a 
bunc h of other m en
 
to one s ide. It s hows  in that pic ture how they are s eparated in one line.
 
 
By the way, I never s aw them  again, m y father  and 16
-
year
-
old brother.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So what we s ee in that photograph, that was  the mom ent of the las t tim e you s aw
 
--
 
> > Ir ene 
Weis s:  Yes. You s ee that c olum n of men. They were s tanding there. After  that they wer e 
s houting line up and go up the ramp. The c r owd m oved up the ram p. We didn't s ee wher e we're going 

or  who was  at the fr ont of the ramp. But soon it bec am e obvious  that we wer e up in fr ont.We were m et 
with about a dozen Nazi s oldier s  blocking our way. They wer e s ort of s tanding r ight in the middle. 
Others  s tood as ide holding the c r owd to s tay in line.
 
 
In a m atter of s ec onds the family was  torn apart. Firs t my m other and two little brothers were 
s ent in one dir ection. Then imm ediately m y 17
-
year
-
old s ister, Serena, into another  dir ection. And that 
s eemed to be where other young adults were s ent. So I and my younger  s is ter, who was  about 12, and 
I was  13, I was  holding her  hand and this  guy doing the s epar ation had a s tick in his hand. The s tic k  
c am e down between us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Between your  hands ?
 

7 
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Between our hands , I was  holding her. He m ade m e go towards  the young adults and 
her  to go where m y mother
 
and c hildren went. I had no idea that photograph was  being taken, 
abs olutely no idea at all. Until maybe 30 year s  after the war  was  over . Thes e photogr aphs s urfac ed. 

But at that ver y m om ent I did not m ove. I stayed wher e I was  s epar ated from  her  bec aus e I
 
was  
abs olutely s tunned that she was  taken alone into the c r owd and m y m other and c hildren had alr eady 

pas s ed. Lots of other s were m oving in that dir ection. It was  obvious  to me that s he will not c atc h up to 

them. I s om ehow felt that I jus t c an't leave lik e this .What will happen to her
? 
And that s he will be alone 
in this  cr owd.
 
 
And even as  this is  happening, we're still trying to find s om e logic al, c iviliz ed explanation to 
what's  going on here. So if wom en and childr en ar e taken, ar e s epar ated, and young
 
adults  are 
s epar ated, it m eans  that it's  s ome kind of a labor  c amp. And that, of c our se, families  will be r eunited 

per iodic ally. Why s hould we not think that? And even with that thinking in m y head, I felt
, H
ow is  this  
little s is ter of mine going to ever  
even get to the point of being reunited
? 
Nobody as ked her name or 
anyone's  nam e. Nobody as ked identific ation. Something was  terr ibly wrong suddenly. The c ivilized 
s ec tion is n't working.
 
 
So I s tood there for an ins tant until s omeone told m e to m ove on in the direc tion. And I r an, 
tr ying to c atc h up with my s is ter, Ser ena, who was  already up the road. I was  yelling for her. She finally 
hear d me and tur ned ar ound. She s ays  to m e, "Why didn't you go with m om?"  She als o looked at it the 

wa
y that norm al peoplewould look: 
 
You'r e a c hild; you s hould be with m om, not with the young adults.
 
 
Well, that was  m y ver y, v er y tr aum atic arrival to Aus c hwitz wher e s uddenly  the entir e fam ily 
was  tor n apar t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then what happened to you and Ser ena? 
 
>> Ir e
neWeis s: Well, Ser ena and I with m any young adults  wer e then taken to a pr oc es s ing plac e, a 
bathhous e, where ever yone's  hair was  s haved and body hair was  s haved very c ruelly and very, very 
dis r es pec tfully. We wer e dis infected. Our  c lothes were taken away. A unifor m dr es s. Shoes  wer e taken 
away. We were tr eated with a gr eat deal of c ontem pt and disr es pec t. And when we came out of ther e
 
--
 
ther e was  a pic ture. I don't know if it s howed up her e. Everybody c ame out looking alike with the hair  

gone, s isters, m
others didn't rec ognize eac h other . 
 
 
Then we were taken into barr acks, into what was  then Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau.We still didn't 
know wher e we wer e.
 
We asked the others  who had c om e before us
 
--
 
the fir st ques tion we asked, 
When is  the reunific ation, the mee
ting of the families
? 
When will we get together
? 
We abs olutely felt 
that is  going to happen som etime.
 
They were pointing to a chim ney, liter ally in the dis tanc e s m ok e and 
flam es c om ing fr om it. They jus t s aid, 
ﬁL
ook  at that. That's  wher e your  fam ilies  ar e.
ﬂ  
And we s aid to 
eac h other
 
--
 
we thought
, W
hat is going on here that you talk  like that
? 
What kind of people ar e you
? 
Why are you s aying these things  to us ? 
 
It didn't penetr ate. It was  s omething that was

What was  the work that you were m ade to do? 
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  So for about thr ee weeks  we really did nothing but we wer e locked into barracks in 

thes e kinds of s helves  wher e we were suppos ed to stay, exc ept when permis s ion given to get off, to 
get out to the bathr oom or for s ome other reas on.
 
After thr ee weeks  we were tattooed, counted off, and 
told t
ha

your  li

At any rate, we wer e marc hed into this plac e wher e we dis c overed that all the belongings of 
the people who cam e in the trains  were br ought to this  plac e. And all the belongings  that c ame out of 
the gas c hamber s, after people wer e killed, their  belongings  were br ought to this
 
plac e. It was  a storage 
ar ea for all the s tuff that c am e into Aus c hwitz

Bir kenau by hundr eds of tr ains .

> > Ir eneWeis s:  Clothing, all the belongings , depending on how long they were out of their hom e. 
There was  ever ything. Ther e was  c lothing. Ther e wer e pants, s uitc as es, toothbr us hes, eyeglas s es, 
s hoes, baby c ar riages, some food pr oducts , violins . You nam e it, whatever  people thought

books, 
whatever they brought with them that was  allowed or they thought would be helpful to them. It was  all 

dum ped outs ide from the trains , by tr uck s  that went back  and forth hauling s tuff from the tr ain to the 
platform . It was dumped outs ide, alongs ide the barr acks. 
 
 
And the s tuff acc um ulated as  high as  the r oof of the barr ack. You c ould
 
literally barely s ee the 
r oof fr om the piles  of s hoes  and c lothing and belongings .
 
We wer e as s igned to get the stuff ins ide the 
bar racks, out of the weather . And onc e inside, eventually, they wer e s orted out by c ategor ies  of pipes  
and things . The s tuff was s ent to Germ any for us e by the Ger man people.
 
But while we wer e working 
ther e day and night

two s hifts , night and day

the stuff k ept c oming from  the tr ains.We could never  
m ake a dent in the pile. It was  just c ons tantly r eplenis hed. Fr om Hungar y, the J ews  wer e deported fr om 

Hungar y within s ix week s  after Germ any oc c upied Hungar y. So in s ix weeks they deport
ed
 
over  
400,000 people into Ausc hwitz.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In s ix weeks ?
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  In s ix weeks.
 
Som ething like 140 tr ains , long trains , arr ived in Aus c hwitz with people 
and the s tuff they did br ing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And where you were forc ed to do this  s orting of all the belongings  that had been taken, 
fr om  that plac e you c ould s ee the inc om ing tr ains. I think  you des cr ibed it as  you had a window on the 
Holoc aus t right there.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Unfortunately we worked adjac ent to one of the gas c ham ber s, c rem atorium number  

four. And we wer e divided from that building by one elec trified fenc e. And we would s ee what was  
going on, on the pr emis es , o
n the other s ide.We would s ee people going in huge c olum ns  of men and 
women and c hildr en going in there and dis appear ing in the gate. And we would s ee bur ning of bodies  
in pits  outs ide on the pr em is es  bec aus e the crematorium s c ouldn't k eep up with the base of the dead 
and s o they burned bodies  outs ide.We s aw that.
 
 
We s aw c olumns of wom en and c hildr en c om ing at night fr om the trains  and s eeing the fir e 
c learly and they would s c r eam and pr ay and cry. And s oon it would be silent. And then we would hear , I 
w
ould hear, the his s ing of the train on the platform arr iving. It was  c los e enough. His s ing, s team engine, 
and the nois e of the crowd. In a m atter  of a half

hour  or s o we would s ee the c olumns  of wom en, 
c hildren, and elder ly approac hing the fr ont of our  win

> > Bill Bens on: When you arr ived at Aus c hwitz, as  you told us, your father  was  s elec ted for work. 

What happened to your father ?

ar r ival, they wer e 
then
 
--
 
the way it was  done, they were then res elected bec aus e from  among them  
they had to pull out the older m en and younger boys . So they, too, were killed.
 

 
My father, apparently
 
--
 
we found out m uc h later  when we were wor king in this  ar ea next to 
the f
enc e that he was  ac tually s elec ted to work in the gas c hambers, in that s ection wher e our own 
m en, our own people, our  own father s and s ons , wer e m ade to pull out the dead fr om  the gas  

c hamber s and were made to help with the bur ning of the bodies . He was  one of thos e who was  forc ed 
to work ther e. He was  s hot, we were to
ld 
by s om eone who was  able to give us  that infor m ation. He was  
s hot s oon after  bec aus e he was n't able to do that kind of work.
 
 
My 16

old br other, no one knows what happened to him . We don't know whether  he was  
with m y father.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To this  day you don't know?

would question did you k now, did you ever m eet anybody like that
.  
He dis

have no idea.
 
 
My father, who worked in this  plac e, s inc e we were next door and s aw thes e men outdoor s 
fr equently, s om etim es they would thr ow over a note. And this  is  how we found out that m y father had 
been ther e. Someone threw over a note.

Thes e m en, our  own men, who in the m os t inc redibly diabolic al c ruelty that they c ould do this 
to our men who had to do this  to their fam ilies  is  indes c r ibable. And for  m any, m any year s  I c ould 
never
 
--
 
I would tell about how my m other and c hild
r en wer e killed
, w
hat happened to s ome of them. I 
c ould never  talk about how m y father died bec aus e im agine this  gentle per s on, head of a loving family, 

would be s ubjec ted to s uc h a thing. This  is  not anything that happens  on this  ear th.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Would like to believe it never  happened.
 
 
Ir ene, soon after you c am e to Aus c hwitz, you did enc ounter your two aunts , Ros e and 
P ir i
. 
And they would bec ome abs olutely es s ential to your  s urvivor  and that of Serena's fr om ther e.
 
> > IreneWeis s:  Yes. It was  qui
te by ac c ident that they c am e. The Hungar ian J ews  arr iving to s ort of a 
general ar ea of Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau. So we ran into them by ac c ident
, b
y sheer  luck , really. They did 
take us under their wing. They made s ure that we ended up in the barr ack  in whic h t
hey were. They 
exc hanged s om e other people two people, from  this  barr ack  to that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause the c ount
 
--
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. They prevailed. Thr ough c onver s ations , people wer e kind enough to let us c om e 
and to m ove to another barr ack . J us t
 
the number s had to m atc h. Nam es wer e never taken anyway. So 
jus t the num bers.
 
 
So m y A
unt Ros e and Pir i, I never  would have s ur vived, I am s ur e of it. Bec aus e from  the 
m om ent I ar rived there, I was  terrified. I was  abs olutely in a panic  of ter ror. I s aw that we were jus t 
dis pos able numbers . They really did both pr otec ted m e and my sis ter
 
--
 
bec aus e even though
 
--
 
what 
the guards  did in this plac e was  tr eat us as s ub
-h
um an
, n
ot like people. We were not hum an beings . 
And that feeling of being tr eated as a su
b-
hum an by another  hum an being is  extremely frightening 
bec aus e you have no r ec ours e. You have no protec tion. If another hum an being thinks of you as  les s  of 

a hum an being and c an do anything, he is  the law
 
--
 
it's  terribly frightening.
 
 
Being young, I was
 
in c ons tant danger of being r es elec ted bec aus e I was  only 13. So to the 
only people that I was  s till a hum an being was  to m y two aunts  and to m y sis ter. I was  their s is ter 's 

c hild. I was n't a s ub
-
human. I clung to them  des per ately.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And they would do all they c ould to m ake you look older to protec t you from being 

s elec ted again.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes, they did. In the lineup of c ounting ever y m or ning, whic h was  a routine, no one 
es c aped from  a plac e lik e that but they c ounted you, 5:00
 
a.m. 
in the m or ning. We wer e thr own out into 
the c old, line up five in a r ow. And the delegation of Nazis  would c om e around 9:00, 10:00
 
finally, all 

dr es sed up in c oats, war m , boots. They would look  down the line. They would c ount. But this was  a 
great opportunity for  them to r es elec t the ones they m is s ed, like c hildr en, or  people who wer e not 

looking good enough for wor k. And all they did is, "Come here." And that was  the end of you.
 
S o m y 
two aunts  would pos ition me on a hill a little, on a s tone a little. I was  never  the fir st one. I was  never the 

las t one. I was  s ort of
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the middle.

> > Bill Bens on:  You would c ontinue living under thes e hor rifying c ir c umstanc es  and c ond
itions  for eight 
m onths, I believe, until Januar y
 
1945 when as  the Soviets  were advanc ing, the Nazis evac uated 
Aus c hwitz. You were forc ed then to go on a Death Marc h.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Yes. So we ar rived in May. In J anuar y the Rus s ian fr ont, the Rus s ian Ar m
y, was  
appr oac hing Aus c hwitz. And ins tead of allowing the r emainder of the pris oners  in Ausc hwitz to be 

liberated, the Ger m ans  had another  diabolic al idea to empty the c am p and for c e the pr is oner s on a 
Death Mar c h deeper away fr om the front and into Ger man
y.
 
I had no idea what was  rationale was  ther e 
exc ept that it had one res ult, it dim inis hed our number by a huge
 
--
 
in a ver y big way bec aus e it was 
wintertim e and we were m ar c hed out on the highway, in the s now, and the outdoors .
 

> > Bill Bens on:  No food.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  No food. No water. No fac ilities . If you s at down or  on to someone, you were s hot. The 

r oad was  litter ed with death people.
 
Oc c asionally  deep into Germany they would s top a bunc h of us  
and put us  into another cam p along the way whic h was  alr eady c r owded. Again, ther e was  not even 

10
 
 
enough time or s pac e to be indoor s  in a bar rack . We wer e s leeping outs ide.
 
We ended up fr om 
Aus c hwitz all the way near  Hamburg.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Deep in Germany.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Deep, deep in Germ any, with huge dim inis hed number s. People died
 a
long the way.
 
 
And then ther e was  five m or e months of the war  befor e 1945 May, befor e the s am e Rus s ian 
Ar m y reac hed us near Hamburg. So in thos e five months the s uffer ing was  indes c ribable. Even the 
Germ an s ys tem, s uc h as it was , broke down by then bec aus e they wer e r etr eating.
 
 
My Aunt 
P ir i
, we wer e s tar ving and s he c am e down with Typhus . They took  her away in a 
tr uck  to a plac e where they had a killing fac ility. Ver y s oon after that, m y s is ter, who was  s kin and 
bones  by now, s he was  pic ked out of the line to be killed. My Aunt Ros e was  des perately ill with a high 
fever , lying on the floor, s he was its  next one that was n't going to m ake it. They picked out my sis ter
; 
I 
r ealized that I would be left alone. And that terr or that was always  with m e s uddenly bec am e 
unbear able. So I s aid, "I'm  her  s ister." So they s aid, "Well
,  
you c an go, too."
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you knew what that m eant.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  I knew exac tly where they were taking her. I c lung to her. She s aid, "You 
c an go, too." 
So they locked us in a room  with other women who wer e in ver y bad s hape, young women. And we 
were waiting for the tr uck  to c ome. And at the end of the day we were s till loc ked in there. It s eemed 
that the tr uck  was n't c oming.
 
It tur ned out th
at becaus e of the appr oac hing Rus s ian front and the c haos  
on the r oad, the tr uck didn't arrive that day. Somebody pus hed the door open and we just walked out of 
that locked r oom.We had a c hanc e to s ur vive another day. But had the truc k  c om e, I wouldn't be
 
her e 
today.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  that like
, 
to walk out
? 
You didn't know what you were walking out to. What 
was  that like?
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  No. We didn't know
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e the Ger mans  really gone
? 
You didn't know.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  At this
 
point when we got back
 
--
 
out of this  r oom, we were not yet fr ee.We just went 
bac k  to the bar r ack  wher e we c ame fr om . And ther e my Aunt Ros e was  lying on the floor , flus hed with 

fever .
 
 
An interesting thing did happen. The other wom en s itting around on t
he floor  ther e, when we 
c am e in, they s aid, "The c hildr en ar e back," "The c hildr en ar e back." That was  the fir st tim e they ever  

r eferr ed to us  as c hildr en. No one ever  dar ed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It would be a death s entenc e.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  Right. Apparently
 
the women were s ort of sad and mour ning us . They thought they'll 
never s ee us again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And here you're back .
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  But it was n't over  at that point. Ther e was  s om e m onths to go until the liberation cam e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about your liberation.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  It was n't a joyous  affair bec aus e we wer e s ic k  and far from  hom e. We k new that we 

had los t our  families , hoping that s om eone m ight have r eturned like m y brother or s ome young adult. 
But we wer e not taken car e of by the liber ating soldiers  in this partic ular  plac e. They wer e Rus s ian 
s oldier s . They had other  r eas ons  for leaving. But they jus t looked and left. Looked at us and left.

fir s t s ign of liberation was  that the guard tower was  em pty

or
 
the
 
fir s t tim e. And people didn't m ove bec aus e what if they're s till ar ound
? 
What if they'r e c om ing back
? 
We 
hear d war  nois es , s hooting and s o on. But nobody left. A few hours later some of the braver women, 

they went and tr ied the gate, the big gate, and it was  open. And still people didn't want to leave 
bec aus e they felt that the Nazis , the s oldier s  are down the road or whatev er .
 
So s lowly, s lowly, thos e 
who c ould walk would walk into the near es t town and looked ar ound, and m oved into s ome empty 

hous es . Ther e was  no help. There was  no tr ans portation.

There were people on the move, refugees .

the s ick  among
 
us, ever y town there was  a hos pital, we put the s ick 
am ong us to be in the hos pital; no
t to be c ured or anything, just to rest for a c ouple of days , then take 
them out, s ic k  as they wer e, move on. We los t many along the way.
 
 
Eventually we made our  way to
 
Pr ague. It was  a long jour ney. We finally wer e in Pr ague 
wher e we began to s erious ly inquir

about if anyone s urvived. So wor d of mouth. Ther e was  no

the m ost im portant person who s ur vived, who finally took c harge of us , was  
one, a young m an, my mother's  br other , m y Unc le J oe. When things got bad, the Hungar ians oc c upied 

us  way back, he decided to tr y to es c ape. He got out. A s ingle man, a young
 
m an alone. He made his  
way to Pales tine, which was  then a plac e that the J ews  tr ied to reac h, young adults , of c our s e. He 
m ade his way. He had his  own tr agic  exper ienc es. He was  put in jail. He was  s ent back  part of the way. 
But he m ade it.
 
 
After the war

dur ing the war  he volunteer ed as  a s oldier in the Czec hos lovakian Arm y. Many 
of thes e young m en enlisted to c om e back to liberate Czec hos lovakia.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he was  back  as  a soldier.
 
> > Ir eneWeis s:  He was  back in Pr ague as  a s oldier , i
n a Br
itis h uniform but as a Czec h s oldier. Ther e 
were a huge num ber of soldier s . And one of thes e s oldier s  we asked in the s tr eet, you know,Wher e do 
you c ome fr om
? 
They c ame fr om  Palestine. My Aunt Ros e, who was  s till with us , this was  her br other. 
So s he foun
d out that he was  als o nearby, stationed near by.We communic ated with him. He didn't 
know that any of his  family was  alive. There was  years  of no com munic ation.We didn't k now that he 
was  alive. He c am e and took c harge of a bundle, a few s urvivor s  two gr andc hildr en and one of his  
sister s. 
 
Later we found a young br other , an additional young br other. Single adults  had a better 
c hanc e to s ur vive. The s is ter s who wer e m arr ied and had c hildren, they wer e killed with the c hildren.

She's living with her hus band in New

> > Ir eneWeis s:  I r eally want to thank you for being inter ested in c oming to the mus eum and to lis ten to 
s om eone like m e to tell you what was  done to m e and to the Jewis h people not s o long ago, in my 
lifetim e not to mention his tory.
 
 
I would like to tel
l you a little bit about an exper ience that I had rec ently. I was  asked to c ome 
to Germ any to testify agains t two Nazi, form er Nazi, guar ds . They were being tried for c ontr ibuting to 
the deaths  of hundr eds of thous ands of people while they were guards  in A
us c hwitz.
 
 
Thes e guards were in Aus c hwitz in 1944 when the Hungar ian J ews  wer e brought there. So 
when my fam ily and other s  ar r ived on the tr ains  from Hungar y, thes e two par tic ular  Nazi guards were 

as s igned to be on the platform guarding and fac ilitating what was  going on there, the s eparation of 
families  and other duties  that they needed to do in or der  for the thing to oper ate c orr ec tly.
 
 
One of the 
guar ds
, his nam e was  Oskar Gr oening, his  job was  to c ollec t all money and 
valuables  that all the m any people br ought with them . He was  on the platform. He knew that he was  

c ollec ting money and belongings, valuables  that people will be killed r ight after and did not bother him . 
He c ollec ted this  m oney, c ounted it, and retur ned it to Germany on a r egular bas is, dai
ly.
 
 
When I tes tified in c our t, he was  s itting
 
--
 
he s aid that he had a gr eat s ens e o
f 
duty and 
obligation to fulfill his  job s o that the oper ation s hould run smoothly. He did not pay attention to anything 
els e. He did not s eem to think  that that was
 
--
 
it was  doing his  job and he was  duty
-
bound to do that.
 
 
So when we, s everal s ur vivor s  fr om  Hungary, tes tified in c ourt and told our s tories  of what 
happened to our fam ilies  and how we wer e tr eated and how our c hildr en were murdered, he s aid 

through his  lawyer  that he had no idea that that exper ienc e had s uc h an effect on the s ur vivor s . So we 
unders tood that he had not c ome out of his  Nazi training and his Nazi idea of what he was  doing. He 
r eally never  apologized. He lis tened to a lot of thes e s tor ies . He 
was  given
 
--
 
was  found guilty, given 
[Indis c ernible] years . He is  appealing his s entence. He is about 94 years old but he will never go to jail 
or  any punis hm ent like that.
 
 
The s ec ond former Nazi that I testified for, he c ame into c our t with his  head down
, alm os t to 
his  c hin, and he never, ever  looked up. He hear d tes tim ony fr om  s urvivor s  like m e and other s , again, 
more 
horrific  stor ies of what he partic ipated in. He never looked up. I never had the feeling that he 
hear d me or  that he was  interes ted, whic h
 
was  ac tually another ins ult.
 
 
Later on, through his lawyer, the lawyer m ade the s tatement to the effec t that, yes , I was  
ther e, he s aid
, ﬁY
es, I s aw what was  going on. I sm elled the burning fles h. You could not es c ape not 
knowing what was  going on but,
ﬂ h
e said, 
ﬁ
I'm s orry now. I s hould have done s omething about it. I'm 
s or r y about that.
ﬂ  
 
However, what he s aid was  s ound
ing
 
like an obser ver
; h
e knew about it, he s aw it, he 
watc hed it, but he had no part of it. So, again, he left the s urvivor s  with the feeling that you s till don't get 

it. You s till don't want to tell us  what did you do
. W
hat was  the inner  workings of the s ystem? How did it 
work fr om the ins ide
? 
What c an you tell us that we experienc ed but didn't know the workings  of?
 
I'm 94 year s old, why don't you c om e up front and tell us what you know
? 
Not a word of that.
 
 
That tr ial is  still going on. He, too, will never  s er ve in jail. But I'm pleas ed that I had a c hanc e 
to tes tify and to have other s  hear  about it in the com munity, the m edia, to report it, s o that what is  now 

the grandc hildren gener ation of Germ an young people have a c hanc e to hear  it from a c ourtr oom , fr om 
s ur vivor s , what their gr andpar ents did. Bec aus e the grandc hildren don't k now the s tor ies . The Germ an 
young people don't know the s tor y
 
bec aus e their parents denied it or s aid it never  happened. And the 
grandpar ents  who wer e the per petr ator s never talked about it. So that at leas t cam e out into the open 

for this  new gener ation to ask their own questions of how their  people c ould have done
 
what they did 
jus t a few year s  ago.
 
 
Thank  you s o m uc h for  lis tening to me.
