Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: This is the United States Holocaust  
Memorial Museum voluntee
r collection interview 
with Fred Ta ucher, conducted by Gail Schwartz on April 26
th
, 2001 at the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. This  is tape numbe
r one, side A. Please give us your full name . 
Answer: It is Fred H. Œ wait, the mi ddle 
name  is Horace Tauc her, t-a-u- c-h-e-r. 
Q: And is th-that the name
 that you were born with? 
A: No, it is not. My name  at birth was Horst Al
fred Taucher. And Horst Œ Horst became  Horace 
and Alfred became Fred. 
Q: And whe r e you were born 
and when were you born? 
A: I was born January 29
th
, 1933 in Berlin, Germa ny.  
Q: Let™s talk a little bit 
about your family first. Ho Œ How long had the family been in this area? 
A: In this area, actually Œ in 
Wa shington, D.C., not very long. 
Q: No, no, no, I meant in Œ in Berlin. 

A: Oh, in Berlin. We ll, I cannot tell you exactl
y, but I do know that my fa ther was born in New 
York, New York, in Manhattan. In fact, he went 
through high school in New York and then went 
to Germany with his parents.  

Q: We re Œ were Œ were his pa
rents born in the United States? 
A: I do not know. I do not know ifmy grandparents were born in the U.S. I Œ I think they were 

born in Germany, lived here and then went back 
to Germany. And when my father was, like I 
say, 19 years old he went to Germany with his parent
s. He learned to be a 
tailor while in Berlin 
and he did get ma rried very late in his life. He 
was ma rried, I think at Œ about the age of 42 or 43 
years to my mother, who also Œ it was my mo
ther™s second ma rriage. And my mother was born 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143

in Oberschlesien, that™s nearBreslau, which is now Poland. And my brother was Œ she had a 
number of brothers and sisters a
ll in Oberschlesien and they were
 dentists and lawyers. She had 
one sister who was an opera singer by the name  of
 Rosie Albach(ph) Gerste
l. She actually passed 
away about a month before I learned that she 
was living in Va ncouver, Br itish Columbia, which 
was about a two and a half hour drive from
 where I lived in Seattle, Wa shington.  
Q: What are your parents™ name s? 

A: My father™s name  was Julius Taucher, and 
of course he succumbed in Auschwitz in 1943, 

short Œ almo st immediately afte
r he was arrest ed. My mother™s
 name  was  Teresa, but she was 
born Œ her ma iden na me wa
s Gerstel, g-e-r-s-t-e-l. 
Q: And your brother™s name  and his a Œ and when was he born? 

A: My brother™s name  now is Henry Ernest, bu
t he™s born Œ when he was born it was E-Ernst 
Henry. And he was born January 3
rd
, 1932. He™s a year older than I am. 
Q: Yeah, and did Œ did Œ do you or did you have other siblings? 
A: We ll, from Œ a Œ a stepbrother, so to spea
k, from my mother™s firs
t ma rriage, she had son, 
which was Klaus Gerstel. And in a way he c-committed suicide. He was arrested, or  on the way 
to be arrested in 1942. And when the SS ca me  to arrest him, at that time we Œ he was living in 

the apar tment, it was kind of ghetto apartment where 
they forced all the Jews to be in. And it had 
a circular type of a stairway. I 
think it had about six stor ies in th
at building. And whe n he learned 
that the SS were there to arrest him, he ran up to 
the top of the stairway, the circular stairway and 
dove headfirst, which of course killed him, but 
he says I am not going to go to a concentration 
camp. 

Q: How old was he at the time? 

A: He wa Œ I think he was 19 or 20 years old.

Q: Did you have a Œ a large extended fa mily?  Y
ou™ve talked about your mother™s family, was 
your father™s fa mily still in the United 
States or were there any in Germa ny? 
A: No, there were two nephews th
at left, one when all of this
 broke Œ came  out in Germany 
about 1938, one nephew of my father™s went to Sout
h America, in Argentina, I believe, while the 
other one couldn™t ma ke it to South America and 
he ended up in Shanghai during the war. And 
after the war, both of Œ which turn
ed out to be our cousins, my  
brother and my cousin, they did 
go to the Œ came  to the U.S. and lived Œ and settled down in Joplin, Missouri. 
Q: But while you were growing up, di-did you ha
ve co Œ before the war Œ while you were 
growing up, did you have contact with this 
Œ these extended cousins and so forth? 
A: Yes, we did meet and they were Œ they live
d in Breslau and they we
re very well off. One 
cousin was crippled, but he sti
ll was very well off, he was a pi
ano player and I think he also 
played some  kind of a piano. He di Œ per-performed a lot of c-c-concert pia Œ he was a concert 

pianist, what I™m trying to say. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: While the other one, I don™t kno
w what he did, but he did own an automobile and he ma de Œ 
drove to Berlin ma ny times to visit us, or actually
 took us to Br eslau and we Œ my father and his 
nephews were very close. 

Q: Now let™s talk about your imme diate 
family. Di Œ again, before the wa r. 
A: Before the war. 

Q: We re your parents very politically active? 

A: Not to my knowledge, I do not know. 

Q: Do you know if they were Zionists? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
4 
 
A: No, they were not. Neither one of my parent
s were very religious. We  were a very Refor m 
type of a Jewish fa mily. 

Q: Did you have as Œ any kind of re
ligious training as a very young child? 
A: Yes, we did go to temple every Friday as 
long as the temple was [i
ndecipherable]. We  even 
learned some Hebrew and we knew how
 to say the prayers in Hebrew. 
Q: And how did you learn these prayers? 

A: We  did learn in the Jewish school, the two y
ears Œ little over two years that I went through 
school, my brother three years, we di
d learn Hebrew Œ ah, the prayers.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Neither my brother or I 
do know Hebrew now, but I still, amazingly enough I can still say 
some of the prayers. 

Q: Mm-hm. What was the name  of
 the temple that you went to? 
A: I do not know. I do not know.  
Q: All right. What kind of
 neighborhood did you live in?  Was Œ was it a mi xed neighborhood of 
Jews and non-Jews? 
A: No, I would say 90 percent were 
Jewish. My father was a tailor, 
he had a tailor shop in Berlin, 
very close to the Kurfürstendamm,
 which is the ma in shopping center, one block off from there, 
and it was pr imarily Jewi sh businesse
s or tailors in other stores.  

Q: And did you have any non-Jewish friends?  Y
ou said you went to a Jewish school. Again, 
we™re talking pre-war. 

A: Yes, my parents had a numbe
r of non-Jewish friends. One of 
them Œ here™s the amazing thing, 
one of them was a mi dwi fe to my birth, and she was a high ranking me mbe r  of the Nazi party. 

She had pictures of Hitler and he
r throughout her entire apartment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143

Q: And how did your father know her? 
A: That, I wish I had an answer, I do not know. I 
don™t know if my father hi
red her as a mi dwife, 
or if my mother did. But she was the mi dwife to
 my birth, may Œ possibly Œ my father was a ma n 
and ladies™ tailor, he™d sew dresses as well as ma
n suits and ma ybe he did some  clothing for her. 
I do not know. 

Q: And her name ?  

A: Her name was Gertrude Noelting, it™s g-e-r-t-
u-d-e, which is a pre
ttycommon German fir Œ 
lady™s first name . And Œ 

Q: T Œ t-r-u-d-e? 

A: Yes, Gertrude, and her last  name  was Noelting, which is Œ using the American spelling, it™s n-

o-e-l-t-i-n-g. 

Q: So, how would you describe yourself as a you
ng child?  We re you very independent, or were 
you more dependent on your pa
rents type of child? 
A: We ll, I would say both. At first we, of course
, were very dependent on 
our parents. But when 
our father wa s arrested in 1943, we realized Œ and 
I say we, my brother and I Œ realized what was 
happening. Well, we already realized what 
was happening back in 19 Œ Nove mber 9, 1938, 
Kristallnacht. Of course, I was not quite six ye
ars old. I was born in ™33, January. And then I 
realized what was happening. And of course th
e Germans took my father™s store away. They 
destroyed his inventory. They
 destroyed his sewing machines. Excuse me . [coughs] They 
destroyed everything and then for
ced us to live, again, in a apar
tment unit there. There were Œ I 
don™t know how ma ny different levels
 in that building there was, 
but we had one room below the 
kitchen. And that™s what we had and that™s what 
every other Jewish family had that had two kids. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
6 
 
They each h- had one room with a kitchen, a small 
kitchen. It was one bathroom in each floor for 
every 10 in Œ in that floor.  
Q: So much had happened after you were born 
that you obviously weren™t aware of, being an 
infant and a Œ and a toddler and 
a small child. Before Kristalln
acht, do you have any me mories, 
or is that your first Œ do you have
 any me mories of people in uniform
, of flags, of anything, or is 
Kristallnacht your first me mory? 

A: No, no, I do have me mory of that. Si -- again,
 since we live d in the 
Jewish area, the Hitler 
youth already, kids 10 years old, ther
e were ma ny a times when we Œ the kids spit Œ spit at us. 
We could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were
 at such an age where we could have Œ ma ybe 
we™re stronger than those kids that  spit at us or
 kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted 
to hit anybody that ha d a Hitler youth uniform. 

Q: How did you know that, as a very young child? 

A: We  were told. 
Q: By?  
A: By the Jewish community, in school and so fo
rth, that the best thing 
is walk away, otherwise 
it™ll be tougher on us. 

Q: So this is some thing that was discussed openly in school Œ 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Œ by your teachers? 

A:  That  i s  cor r e ct . 

Q: What about your fami ly?  Did you ta
lk this over with your parents? 
A: I Œ I Œ I wished I had an answer
, I do not reme mber that. I do not.  

Q: Now, what about with your 
brother?  We re you very close to
 your brother as a young child? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
7 
 
A: We  were [indecipherable] Œ oh, 
my brother and I were very clos
e together and even today we 
still are very close together even 
though I live in Seattle, he lives 
in Los Angeles, but we are very 
close. 
Q: So as two young boys, and I know very young, and 
you see these frighteni
ng situate Œ or part 
of these frightening situations, did y
ou talk this over with your brother? 
A: Okay, yes we did. Nowadays, even though my  br
other is a year older, he hardly remembers 
what transpired. He just wiped th
is whole thing out of his me mor
y. If I can say here, last week, 
of course, was Holocaust Reme mbrance week. I 
was asked by the you Œ army in Fort Lewis, 
Washington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army
 there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, 
preferably concentration camp ho Œ su-survivors that have al so been in the U.S. military, 

preferably in military service. I spent time in
 the U.S. Army, received a warrant  offi cer 
commission during my s e rvice in Korea and I t-
talked about the Holocaust. I did want my 
brother to talk about the Holocaust, but Œ and the 
reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time  in 
Vietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm Œ U.S.
 Army, retired a major,
 a mu ch higher ranking 
officer than me . But he says he just can™t talk 
about it, he doesn™t reme mbe r  it and does not want 
to talk about it. And he™s [indecipherable] he can
™t reme mber  what has happened, yet he™s a year 
older. He cannot speak German any more. While 
he was in the military he was stationed in 
Germany, in Heidelberg for three years, but 
never had anything to do with the Germans. 
Q: When you were little, in the 30™s, were 
Œ did you and your brothe
r talk about what was 
happening? 

A: No, not that I can recall. We  started talking 
about it, together with 
our parents too, after 
Kristallnacht . And we were told, just try and 
st ay away from Hitler youth. Don™t get involved, 

don™t get into arguments. And of course, in 1941, I 
think it was, when we had to wear the Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
8 
 
Star of David. And there were Œ it
™s not just wearing the star, th
ere were limitations made, what 
Œ we couldn™t go to a store except between five 
and six o™clock in the afternoon. And there were 
so ma ny restrictions, we couldn't 
use public transportation. And my 
brother and I talked about it, 
but we knew there was nothing we could do 
and just hoping that it will get better. 
Q: What does a man like Hitler mean to a fi ve year  old German Jewish child? 

A: I wish I had an answer for that. I Œ I Œ we
 knew that he was not good for us, but we  always 
thought it would become better. And again, we
 were unique inasmuch our father was an 
American citizen. And our father never thought 
that he would be arre
sted and sent to a 
concentration camp. He figured our family would ev
entually be given exceptions. He just didn™t 
think it would happen. And Œ go ahead. 

Q: What language did you speak at 
home, since your father was American? 
A: Only German. We did not know any English. In 
fact, when my brother and I came  to the Œ the 
U.S. after the war, it was only Germa n. 
Q: Do you know why your father didn™t raise you 
from birth to be bilingual because he™s Œ he 
had lived in America? 
A: I think he was afraid to teach us English. 
Just Œ actually, my father
, even though he was an 
American citizen, he served in the German 
ar my during World Wa r I. And again, that was 

anot her reason t hat  he f-fel t , l i ke ma ny Jews t hat
 was i n t he German ar my duri ng Wo rl d Wa r Œ 
World Wa r I, figured that they would not ever be
 arrested. And even when my father lost his 
business, his tailor shop and was 
mo ved Œ a-and we had to go and liv
e in this apartment, he had 
to go into slave labor, but he fi
gured that™s the worst that the Ge
rmans will do to hi m,  they forced 
him into forced labor. And Œ but still he 
never thought that he™d 
ever be arrested.  
Q: Describe the school you we
nt to in the beginning.  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
9 
 
A: I wished I could, but I do know we had hundred to
 150 kids in class. And 
that™s about all I can 
reme mber. I do not know the name  of the schools, wh
ich I did learn last y
ear when I found the ca 
Œ archives in the east of Berlin, in Potsdam.
 But other than that I just do not reme mber. 
Q: But it was a Jewish school with Je
wish children and Jewish teachers? 
A: That is correct, but there were wa
y too ma ny kids in a class, and Œ 
Q: How old were you when you began school? 
A: We ll, I began school when I was six years 
old, in 1939. There was Œ was some  ki nd of a 
school almo st e-equivalent to kindergarten
 here, yeah, when I was five years old. 
Q: So now let™s talk about Kristallnacht, because
 that was a pi votal point. As a five and a half 
year old, what Œ what do you 
reme mber about that time ?  
A: I reme mb er it was in the mi ddle of the nigh
t, which I really think was about four in the 
morning, when all of a sudden Œ ma ybe I shoul
d go back a little b
it before the actual 
Kristallnacht. It was probably two or three da
ys prior to Kristallnacht. The shop windows were 
just painted with pic Œ Jude, which means Jew, 
in front. And Œ well, you couldn™t look out, they 
were just plain painted with cuss words, so to speak, being a Jew and so forth. 

Q: And you were old enough to know what that implied? 

A: Yes, yes, I was old enough. And Œ 

Q: How did you Œ how does a young child interpret that? 

A: Again, I wished I had an answer and could gi
 Œ tell you how my feelin
g was, but I thought it 
was terrible that the shop window
s of my father were all painte
d. Very bad. And then my father 
was forced to clean and ma ke those windows comple
tely clean and it took him all day to have Œ I 
think he had two razor blades to scrape all th
e paint off. And Œ but he wer Œ every other shop 
owner, Jewish shop owner in the street was forced to do the same  thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
10 
 
Q: Did you see your father do this? 
A: Yes, I saw, in fact, I tried to
 help. We Œ our Œ we tried to help
 him, but very little we  could do, 
especially he only had two razor blades, and he 
was forced to do it. And it was two days later, 
after the windows were all taken Œ cleaned, that™swhen then they shattere
d all the windows. And 
we lived in the back of the store, and of c
ourse we saw what was happening. We  were scared, 
and I knew in my Œ I still reme mber my mothe
r™s Œ my Œ my mother 
saying, what are we going 
to do?  They™ve took our store away, they™ve ru
ined everything. And I reme mber my father 
telling my mother, well don™t worry, that™s what 
we  have insurance for. We have insurance for 
vandalism, for theft, and we™ll 
just have the insurance companies replace everythi ng. Of course, 
that never happened. And I do reme mber this lik
e it was yesterday. Yeah, it was Œ I wa s five 
years and 10 month old. And you kind of grew 
up quickly and became mat ure prematurely.  
Q: Wh Œ to see Germans in uniform, wh
at is that vision like for a child? 
A: Very bad. I Œ I feared, especially the brown uni
forms, which was in the SR, or the SA, or the 
black uniforms with a skull, which we re the SS. 
We feared that. It was so me thing that chilled 
your bodies, at least that™s what it did to me . I 
Œ I knew what it was. Whe n I Œ it goes right back 
watching the Hitler youth uniform. When I see a kid 
in a Hitler youth uniform, I wal ked and tried 
not to be seen by them, e s pecially when Œ goi
ng back to 1941 when we had to wear the yellow 
star. We just shied away from the m. 

Q: Did you have nightma res of Œ 

A: Not as a child, but afterwards, and even occasi
onally when I Œ I™d Œ a year ago when I was in 
Berlin, I visited the old SS headquarters, wh
ich wa s Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. And I Œ that 
evening I had nightma res. In fact, I was asked to 
give a taped interview over there. They had my 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
11 
 
record that I was tortured th
ere. And yes, I had some  pre
tty bad headquarters Œ I mean, 
nightmares. 
Q: So, le-let™s get ba
ck to Kristallnac ht.  
A: Right, Kristallnacht Œ 

Q: So you woke up the next morning, and Œ 

A: That™s right. We ll, I woke up when they shat
tered the window, just th
e noise from the window 
shattering and the noises. And again, you Œ 
down Jews, and so forth. A-And you Œ you don™t 
deserve to be living here. And I 
reme mber that li Œ again, like I 
said, like it was yesterday. And Œ 
Q: Did you Œ did you share a room with your brother? 

A: Yes, in fact we only had Œ actually we had tw
o rooms. One room my brother and I lived Œ and 
these were small room, almost Œ wha t  you almost 
have a Œ like a walk-in closet over here. And 

then my mot her and I had another room. 
And we  had a small kitchen and a small Œ 
Q: Yeah, but this was in the firs
t apartment that you grew up in. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay, so then what happened? 

A: And then we had to move from t hat apartm
ent into a smaller apar tm
ent unit. And this is 
where I said we had one room per fa mily, plus a kitchen. 

Q: And your father? 

A: He was there, too. Of course, I wa Œ 
reme mber , this was probably in fi Œ ™42. 
Q: No, no, no, no, we™re still 
at Œ at Kristallnacht. 
A: Oh, still at Kristallnacht. 

Q: Yeah, let™s go through this Œ 

A: Oh, there we just [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
12 
 
Q: Œ chronologically. 
A: Okay, I™m sorry. The Kristallnacht we were ac
tually in the store. We had two rooms in the 
back of the store. In-Incidentally, 
that same  store that I reme mber fr
om Kristallnacht is still at  the 
same  location, it was not bombed out. 

Q: So th-the Œ the store windows were broken, y
our father said insurance would cover it, and 
then what happened? 

A: Right. Then what happened, of course, insu
rance didn™t cover it, a
nd the Germans gave my 
father, I think two or three days to move out and 
they told her that we have to move to this 
apartment unit, which was Comman
dant Strasse 63, I reme mber that
 address. And incidentally, 
when I again visited Berlin, I tr
ied to look up that old apartme n
t unit. Unfortunately it Œ it was 
bombed, but the entire block is flat because this
 Œ the old Berlin wall se parating east and west 
Berlin went right through it. So that is no longer in ex
istence. It™s just an
 empty lot right now. 
Q: So it was late November, or 
early December ™38 that you moved? 
A: It was November, probably. We ll, Kristallna
cht was November nine and I would say about 
the 10
th
 or the 11
th
 Œ 11
th
 or 12
th
 when we had to move. 
Q: Oh, you had to move  imme diately. 

A: We had to move immediately, I th
ink the Œ two or three days. And Œ  
Q: We re you able to take everything with you? 

A: No, they Œ they took most of our Œ everything
 Œ most of what we had they took away. They 
just scatter it out in th
e streets. We  had very, very little to
 take along. Some  clothing. I think my 
father had some  Œ he must have suspected some
thing, but some  of the ma
terial that he ma de 
clothi ng out of, he had some place else . And he 
did some  sewi ng for us once we moved in the 

apartment, and he did this late at ni ght, because  there Œ after he  was forced to work on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
13 
 
railroad, and Œ which was slave labor. But at night 
he would sew some  clothi
ng for us so that we 
had some thing to wear, because I think ever
ythi ng we owned really, was taken away. 
Q: Did you have any special toys
 or anything that you were able
 to take with you, you and your 
brother? 
A: No, they were Œ we had no toys, or Œ we Œ we
 just didn't grow up with toys. We  Œ I think my 
brother and I, I don™t know what 
we did for play. I don™t think we
 played. We  just Œ we just 
didn™t. I Œ 

Q: Even before Kristallnacht? 

A: Even before Kristallnacht, yeah. We did Œ I 
probably should me ntion that. We  lived pretty Œ 
pretty close to a small park and so forth, which 
had a river and so forth and I know there was one 
time when some  Hitler youth pushed my brother in
to the river in Berlin. And my brother, of 

course, did not know how to swim a t  that time a
nd he almost drowned and some German worker 
in a bi Œ on a bicycle saw my brother drowning and he jumpe d in and saved him. And of course, 
he had the Je wish Star on David on my Œ my br
other had that on, but that German still saved him 
and made sure that my brother was alright a
nd found out where we lived and took my  brother 
actually home, in this apartment. Well, my father
 then, again had ma terial and sewed him, this 
ma n, some  c l othing and so forth. 
We ll, that poor ma  Œ gentlema n was arrested because he saved 
a Jew. And I do not know whatever happened to hi
m. He was not permitted to talk to us any 
more, but I do reme mbe r  that he 
was arrested for saving a Jew. 

Q: Do you know his name? 

A: No, I do not know. I wished Œ if I knew his na
me  I would try Œ would have tried to look him 
up. 

Q: So, you moved out of your apartment at Œ a couple days after Kristallnacht. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
14 
 
A: Right. 
Q: And then what did you do?  Did you still go to school? 

A: No, I think Œ yes, we did. We  went to sc
hool through 1942, again to a Jewish school, and of 
course there were ma ny, ma ny kids in one class. 
And learning, I would sa
y most of my schooling 
was self studied at our mother. Yeah, I think pr
obably our mother taught us more how to read 
than what we learned in school. 

Q: Did your mother work with
 your father in the store? 
A: No, not really, she pretty much took care of us
, and again, gave us classes, how to write and 
read. 

Q: And did anything happen to your extended family on Kristallnacht? 

A: Well again, like I say, I had a stepbrother from
 my mother™s previouser Œ marr-marriage. And 
of course he killed hims elf the day he was suppos
ed to have been arrested. And we™ve had Œ but 

most of our extended family, especially from ou
r mother™s side, lived in Breslau, which is now 
Poland. And we had one aunt in Berlin, but she to
o was one of the early ones that was arrested 
and was in Œ shipped to Theresienstadt and I do 
not know if she died over there. We  lost track. 
And I™ve done some  research on it 
and I can™t find any record on her. And of course all of m Œ 

most of my father™srelatives e
ither were Œ rema ined in the U.S. or went to South America. 
End of Tape One, Side A

Beginning Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holocaust Memorial Muse
um volunteer collection 
interview with Fred Taucher. This is tape num
ber one, side B and we™ve already talked about 
Kristallnacht and your moving into the n Œ into an
 apartment. Let™s now talk about your father, 
what he did after his store was destroyed. 
A: It was shortly after Kr istallnacht when his 
store was destroyed, his property taken away and 
we were forced into living into a big apartmen
t unit where ma ny, ma ny J e ws were forced to live. 
And my father was forced to work on the railroad
. Rather than being a tailor he was forced to 
work doing hard labor. It was s Œ definitely slav
e labor. And he was actuall
y forced to live there 
until hi -his arrest  in 1943.  

Q: So, did he come  back at night, or Œ 

A: Yes, he did come  back every night, comple
tely exhausted. And I do reme mber that, as young 

as I was. I mean, he could hardly move, but he
 did come  back and he ate what little food my 
mother had to cook for him.  

Q: Where did your mother get the food? 

A: We ll, that was another problem a-after the Kr
istallnacht, when she cou Œ only had a choice to 
go to Œ to stores by Œ owned by Jews, between fi
ve and six o™clock in the evening. And Œ and 
what I think my mother did, she we
nt to the store long before five
 o™clock so that she would be 
one of the first in line to buy what necessary f
ood products she could get. And it was very, very 
small. 

Q: Prior to that, I understand that the Germans for
ced the Jewi sh me n to take the name  in their 
identification papers of Israel and the mothers 
Œ or the wome n to take the name  of Sarah. Did 
that happen to your parents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
16 
 
A: Yes, it did. Their name s beca me  Œ the mi ddle na
me  was always Israel or Sarah and actually, I 
think even as boys we had Œ we became  Israel, 
was one of the name s. I just vaguely reme mber 
that. 
Q: Did your Œ did your parents sa
y anything about that to you? 
A: Not really, not really, but yeah, I think ev
ery boy was Israel and 
every girl was Sarah. 
Q: Did you have your own papers, or your  parents ha-had you on their papers? 

A: I do not recall that, I think our
 parents had the papers, I don™
t think we had our own papers. 
Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, there 
was the anschluss in Œ in Œ in 
Austria. Did Œ were you aware of 
that? 

A: No, we were not. I did not lear
n this really, until I was older. 
Q: Had your parents, or especially
 your father, ever thought of leav
ing at this time , or did they 
ma ke any efforts to try to leave? 

A: Yes. Back in 1934, I understand, they did ma ke an
 effort to leave and we all got as far as 
Holland. But Œ it ma y have been 1936, we got as
 far as Rotterdam I think, but I think the 
Germans already were doing a lot of things 
and even though they haven™t Œ hadn™t invaded 
Holland yet, but the Œ the Œ they fo
rced my father to go back to Be
rlin. Apparently the Œ he didn't 
have the proper papers to leav
e Germany. And of course Œ and 
he had to pay Œ every penny he 
had, he had to pay just to get back
 to Berlin, and he just didn't ha
ve the financial resources to get 
us Œ to get us back out. But then again he was 
so convinced, being an American, that they are 
going to leave him alone. They™ll give him a rough 
time, but he felt he™d be left alone. And 
again, like a lot of people, especially business pe
ople were arrested and sent to concentration 
camp, going back to 1941 and 1942. My father wasn
™t arrested until 1943, and I think there are 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
17 
 
records here at the Holocaust Museum, the date 
he was arrested, even the transport number. I do 
not reme mb er now. 
Q: But Œ but you were saying, to go backwards, that
 in 1936 he was able to get you Œ the four of 
you to Œ to Œ th-the four of you in fa mily to Œ to Rotterdam? 

A: I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of th
e dates, cause again I was too young, I Œ I know 
we moved some place, and Œ but I do not know. But I know through when I lived with my 

cousins after I came here to the U.S., they said 
that he took us all once to Holland then had to 
turn back, but then he ran out of mo ney. 

Q: Now, you™re attending school, 
you™re in your new, s maller ap
artment. Your father is doing 
slave labor, your mother is tryi
ng to get food and you™re attendi
ng school with your brother?  And 
did you again have any contact with
 non-Jews then, children your age? 
A: None whatsoever. Other kids, 
they wouldn™t Œ they wouldn™t dare associate with Jews, and it 
was strictly other Jewish kids 
that we were in contact with. 
Q: Did you play game s as a child during this ti
me?  We re you ab Œ were the young children able 
to Œ I don™t want to use the word disregard, but
 you know, b-be norma l children and play game s 
during this very diffi cult time? 

A: I do not reme mber, I do not think we played 
game s. I just cannot reme mber that we  ever 

played game s. I think the times were so compli
cated. I think in school the teachers concentrated 
more in group learning and littl
e bit of Hebrew, you know, we studi
ed like the Hebrew alphabet 
and so forth. 

Q: But your lessons were in German? 

A: Yes, in German. Again, we did learn the Hebr
ew alphabet, the aleph, bet, gimmel, dalet and 
so forth, which I still know today. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
18 
 
Q: What did the United States mean to a si
x, seven year old German child under stress? 
A: It definitely meant, this is where we™re goi
ng to go. Our father always told us how great the 
U.S. are and some day we™re all going to move to the U.S. after the war is over. The U.S. will win 

the w Œ will prevail and we™re a
ll going to go to New York. And we were pretty much raised 
with that  me ntality, that to live Œ to go to
 the United States, it was Œ we said America. 
Q: What did it mean to you, what did it represent? 

A: It represented i Œ I guess you could say freedomand that it is the best country in the world to 

grow up. 

Q: So you continued school in 1940. Were you 
aware Œ granted, you were seven Œ you know, 
young, of what Hitler wa s doing and 
invading other countries in 1940? 
A: Yes, we did. We  were aware of that. 

Q: How did you know it? 

A: Well Œ 
Q: Did you have a radio? 
A: Yes, we had a radio and we heard it on the 
radio and we listened 
to Hitler and his other 
cronies, and yes, we we
re fully aware of it. 
Q: Do you reme mber his voice on the radio? 

A: Oh yes, I reme mber his screaming, definitel
y. Occasionally, which we weren™t supposed to, I 

Œ this is just Œ as we are talk
ing now, I do reme mb er once in awh
ile, illegally, we took our S-Star 
of David off and did attend a movie thea Œ watche
d a movie, maybe a comedy or something, that 
we™d go to a public movie. And of course in 
these movies they also had all this prop Œ 
propaganda. And I do reme mber that now, but I never thought about this until right now. 

Q: How did you know you™d have to
 wear a Star of David? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
19 
 
A: Oh that Œ every Œ I would say even a five year old kid knew that. 
Q: How?  

A: I think it was publicized Œ told
 by our parents, and everybody. We
 just knew we we re inferior 
citizens and we had to w
ear that [indecipherable] 

Q: Did you feel inferior? 

A: We  didn™t feel inferior, but we knew to th
e Germans we were inferior. And I think it Œ I 
probably shouldn™t compare, but I will. I think it
™s the same  way when the Afro-Ame ricans at 
one time had to sit at the back 
of the bus, they had separate pub
lic restrooms. And while I don™t 
think the average child Œ black pe
rson realized that they were tr
eated as a inferior citizen, but 
they were treated that wa y, and this is, I think ho
w we fe lt in Berlin during the war, in Germany 
during the war. 

Q: And t-tell me  about the ye
llow star, where you wore it and how it was put on your clothes. 
A: The yellow star was on our left chest, really, 
and it was Œ had to be sewn on, it had to be sewn 
on neatly. And of course our father being a tailor,
 he did that. And we Œ when we went outside 
into the public streets, we had to wear it. And 
if you didn™t wear it you were arrested, whether 
you were a five year 
old or a 55 year old. 
Q: What did you feel lik
e wearing a yellow star? 
A: I felt scared, always scared, 
because I knew that ot
her kids could come , even if they were 
three year old, or four year olds, 
they could spit at us, they cou Œ 
if they had a stick they could hit 
us and we couldn™t hit back. And so yes, I was 
scared and really afra
id to go out. And again 
some ti me s I think we were blessed, both my brot
her and I, we  did not really look Jewish. So 
some ti me s we did take the chance and did not w
ear the star and did go out and went to a movie 
theater and so forth.  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
20 
 
Q: Wh- Whe n you say you didn™t look Jewish, can you describe yourself? 
A: We ll, you know, there are certain people, you
 can tell they™re Jewi
sh.Oh, you ma y ma ke a 
mi stake, like even some  Egyptians look Jewi
sh, but we were not 
obvious Jewish looking, 
otherwise we  never would have survived living in Berlin. 

Q: We re you fair coloring, and Œ 

A: Yes, yes, very fair coloring and some times
 people thought my brothe
r is a little darker 
colored, but he looked more Ital
ian, and in those days Italy an
d Germany were still allies. 
Q: So did you Œ w-were you ever did 
Œ spat upon?  Did any of the nay Œ 
A: Oh yes, yes, we were spat upon many times. A
nd like I said earlier, my brother was pushed in 
the water, almost Œ could have drowned. And we
 underwent Œ probably my 
brother went through 
s Œ more severe pan Œ punishme nts than I was, for some  reason. 

Q: Because he was a year older? 

A: Yeah, I think so, or it™s just where he was at
, we weren™t always toge
ther. And he was Œ he 
was mi streated more than I was, I 
believe, at the begi
nning of the war. 
Q: And wha t  about your other Jewish friends, ot
her little Jewish boys?  
Did you act out any of 
this or talk this over with them? 

A: Again, here is a mi nd that is
 blank, I don™t reme mber. I do reme
mbe r  being with other Jewish 
kids, some times walking to school together. A
nd I don™t think a day went
 by where we didn™t Œ 
weren't Œ not beat up, bu-but mi streated by the Ge
rman kids, especially Hitler youth kids and 
Hitler youth was 10 years and ol Œ over.  

Q: Do you get used to this treatme nt?  Does
 a child get used to this treatment? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
21 
 
A: We ll, they expect it. It™s Œ I don™t think you 
ever get used to some th
ing like that and I know I 
never did, but I expected it and it™s just so
me thing I knew was going to happen. I don™t know 
how else I can explain that.  
Q: And again, did you confide in
 your Œ in your parents? 
A: Oh yes, oh definitely. And again, I don™t reme
mber what my parents said. My mother just 
said well, those days will pass by, just be patie
nt. These were, I think, what my parents were 
saying. 

Q: So you fe lt your parents were a comfort to you at this time . 

A: Oh, very much so. Very much so. Our pare
nts did comfort us as much as they could. 
Q: And so then it™s 1941, you™re still at 
school, your father is
 doing slave labor Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ and life goes on. Any recollectio
n during that year, or even w
ith Pearl Harbor in December, 
any Œ the bombing of Pearl Harbor  in December and Americans going into the war. 
A: No, we Œ we didn™t know about that. I did know that Franklin Roosev
elt was president. I do 
reme mber this, but I do not reme mber Japan bombi
ng Pearl Harbor. I never even heard of Pearl 
Harbor, so no, I did not
 know anything like that. 
Q: Now, you said this German woman who was your mi dwife was an acquaintance of your 
fa mily. Wa s there any relationship with her dur
ing this time ?  Had you known about her at this 
point in your life, in 1940 Œ ™41? 

A: Yes, I did, because there were time s, going ev
en back to 1939 where we did visit her at he r 
apartment. And she had a Œ an apartment in the be
tter part of Berlin, Sch
öneberg and we did visit 
her. Some times she had dinner for us. And, in fact there were times th Œ when she picked us up 

where we lived and we did remove 
our Star of David when we had 
to wear it, and we  went with 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
22 
 
her to her apartment and there we were very sa fe 
because she also Œ I think she had a special I.D. 
or some thing, that she was a high ranking Nazi
 member, a personal friend of Hitler. So nobody 
bothered her when Œ especially wh
en we were with her, too. 
Q: Was she married? 
A: No, she was never married and at that time 
she was probably in her middle 50™s. She died 
when she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war. 

Q: I™m sure you™re always asked how do you explainthe fact that this Nazi party me mber was so 

helpful to you. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Even at that time , and we™ll 
get to more late
r, of course. 
A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn™t figure that
 out at all, but now, being older and seeing 
what has happened, my guess is that she was such
 a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler 
and deep inside she was convin
ced that Hitler did not know wh
at was going on. She used to tell 
that to my father, to my mother
, that Hitler doesn™t know what™s going on. Once he learns what™s 
going on, he™s going to st op that. And I believe becau
se of that mentality, she was convinced if 
she would be caught helping us, that Hitler w
ould free her and she would say everyt hing to 
Hitler. A-And I think that ™s the only reason that  I 
can think of why she helped us. And of course 
she mu- mus t also feel that she brought me  ont
o this world. And I think that™s the only reason. 
And I think I™m the only Jewish pers
on she ever assist ed in a birth. 
Q: Did she deli Œ she did not
 deliver your brother? 
A: No, she did not. My brother I think was 
deliver ed at a Jewish hospital in Berlin. 
Q: And how is that you were not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
23 
 
A: Again, I don™t know. I Œ I Œ I th 
Œ some how either my father or
 my mot her befriended her, 
and I guess this would have been my mother™s ac
tually third child, me , and I guess she wasn™t as 
uncomfortable being assisted by a mi dwife. 
Q: So, were you born at home? 

A: Yes, I was. In fact it was Œ my fa ther ha Œ 
actually, he had two stores, one of them was within 
two blocks of each other and the first store is wher
e I was born. I think that was in Petsalozzi(ph) 
strasse. And then later on Leipne(ph)
 strasse, which was at Kr istallnacht. 
Q: So you would go t-to her house and Œ the four 
of you a-and visit with her, and fi Œ through 

1941 and did life go on in this difficult way til 1942?  And then what happened in 1943? 

A: We ll, in 1943, one day our father didn™t come  
home . And again, we did have a number of n-

non-Jewish friends that were ag
ainst the Hitler regime . And it 
was one woma n that says, leave 
your apartment, the Germans are arresting every
body. They took your father away, he™s Œ he was 

arrested.  
Q: So that™s how you heard, through this woma n?  
A: That™s right, who was a friend of ours and sh
e Œ I think she owned a Œ a laundry or some thing 
like that. But, just outside the Jewish section of 
Berlin. And Œ and she is th
e one that told us, and 
it™s Œ really, it was very close. Wh
en we gathered the few things th
at we owned Œ as I say we, my 
mother, my brother and I, the few things we ow
ned, we left the apartment and ther e was a back 
entrance. We went out the back entrance a
nd we understand that the SS came  up the front 
entrance. So we just barely escaped. 

Q: How mu ch time elapsed between the time
 the woma n told you and the time you left? 
A: Again, I™m guessing here, I would say less 
than an hour. It was very, very close. 
Q: So your father was taken away 
when he was on the labor battalion? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
24 
 
A: That is correct, he wa s, right from work taken away. And again, from what I see, the record 
showed he was shipped to Auschwitz and probably 
Œ again, talking to Ausc
hwitz survivors, they 
say norma lly what happened is when they arrive
d in Auschwitz, they had two sides. One side 
they were tattooed and they were in the work pa
rade, the other side di 
Œ were not even Œ didn™t 
even get a nu mber, they were put in the ga
s chamber and my father was one of those. 

Q: Your father was what, late 40™s, or 50 by then? 

A: I would say he was Œ I think my father was in 
the early 50™s at the time. Well, my fa ther, I Œ I 
can probably figure it out. I am not sure. He was born either 1981 or 1991. 

Q: Now, you mean 1891. 

A: Yeah, I mean 18 Œ 1891, yes,
 or nin Œ 1891, I™m not sure. 
Q: So he Œ so he was 53. 

A: Right. And again, he was murdered in Auschw
itz, roughly two days after he arrived there 
from what other people tell me  that have been there. 
Q: So your mother got you two boys together. 
A: Right. 

Q: And whe r e did she and you go? 

A: Okay, again we™re going right back to this Nazi
 mi dwife. She, because of her friendship with 
Hitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of Berlin. And only high ranking SS offi cers could 

have cabins there. And this is where she put us. 
She told all the other offi cers, military offi cers, 
mostly SS, that our father was a Œ a Œ I guess a co
lonel or something in the army Œ ar Œ German 
army and he was out in the fronts in Œ in the fron
t line in ka Œ Russia. And we lived there, right 
amongst the SS, or the wives of the SS. But then of course wintertime came along Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
25 
 
Q: Well Œ well now wa Œ wait a mi nute, what ab
out papers? Did you mother Œ wh-wh-when this 
happened in the beginning, what 
kind of papers did your mother have?  She didn't have these 
papers. 
A: Fraulein Noelting, the mi dwif
e, s he provided my mother with papers, where we went under 
different name s and us kids went
 under different name s. And ag
ain, she was right up with her 
party and we ha Œ there was bombing and a lot 
of civilians were kille
d during bomb air raids 
back in the 40™s. And so this 
mi dwife, she found out what family with Œ what mother with two 

children were killed at a certain
 Œ our age, were killed at cert
ain a-a-apartments, or houses. And 
she got us those types of iden
tification. And that™s how we liv
ed. Of course, then after six 
months or so, people were wondering Œ some ti
mes my Œ maybe I should go Œ my brother and I 
would act like we™d go to school. We™d wear the bags
 to go as if we were going to school, but we 
never did go to school. We didn™t da re go to sc
hool because of every child had to go into 
physical training and then you take a bath. We ll, us
 being boys, being circumcised would give us 
away. So we never went to school. But then pe
ople got kind of suspicious, they Œ nobody ever 
saw us in school, other kids. So this mi dwife says
, you have to leave from there. And then again 
we took on different I.D. and we mo ved from area 
to area, place to place. 
Some of the places I do 
not know, but I Œ 

Q: So the first location you stayed for six m
onths. What was your new identification, who were 
you? 

A: I was Œ it so happened I was Horst Grossma
n. My mother was a Grossman, I don™t know what 
her first name was, and my brother was a Grossman. 

Q: These were German, not Jewish Grossmans. 

A: These were German name d people th
at were killed during an air raid.  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
26 
 
Q: She obviously felt very positive towards Jews
 then, she had no nega
tive feelings towards 
Jews, or Œ or were Œ or did she 
and you were just special cases? 
A: I believe we were special cases because she used to complain about Jews, they all have so 

much mone y and they are ruining the economy of 
Ger many. I used to hear her say things like 
that, even to my mother
. And yet she said, but our fa mily 
was different. She was very strange. 
Well, when Œ after the wa r, when only my brothe
r and I survived, she was real upset when we 
told her we™re going to try and go to America. 
And she was very upset because she says, you are 
Germans, you can™t leave. And when my brothe
r and I did leave Germany, and we wrote to her 
once we got to the U.S., she would never answer us, she was so upset. She said we don™t show 

any thank you. 

Q: What would you two boys do during the time  th
e Jew Œ the German children were in school?  
What would you do, you™d take your sc
hoolbags and what would you do? 
A: What we did, we Œ this was out
 in forest type of an area and 
we would just walk inside the 
forest. In fact, we would pick mushrooms, this is
 what we ate all the ti
me . My brother and I and 
our mother too, we got to know every edible 
mushroom. And instead of going to school, we 
would pick mushrooms, so that™s what
 we had to eat most of the time. 
Q: What did your mother do? 

A: Oh, I think she Œ she st ayed at the cabin and 
she washed clothes. I th
ink she did wash clothing 
fo Œ wash and did other things for some  other people to get some  income . 

Q: On Œ in your free time, or when the German 
c hildren were not in school, did you play with 
them, did you talk with them?  

A: I don™t reme mber. I think we did, but I can™t 
be sure. There are so ma ny blanks that I can™t 
really tell you for sure if we 
did or not. I think we did. I 
do know Œ one thing I do reme mber, 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
27 
 
during the Œ there was a vacati
on period about four weeks or 
so and there was one kid Œ a 
German kid, not Jewish, who drove
 Œ he was 15 years old and he 
drove a milk delivery vehicle, 
it was a motorized vehicle. And I Œ I helped him de
liver the milk. And he was pretty much a real 
Nazi believer, Hitler youth, but some how he 
Œ he befriended me , and we became friends. Of 
course, I didn™t tell him who I was. And I know th
ere was a time where I helped him deliver the 
fresh milk. 

Q: What™s it like Œ what was it like to see a swastika? 

A: Fear. Just plain fear. Of course you saw 
it, no ma tter where you went you saw it. And the 
swastika was actually easier to get used to. The th
ing that bothered me  was the Œ the skull that 
the SS had on, or even some  soldiers that were a
ffiliated with the SS all wore that Œ that skull. 
That was, to me, worse than the swastika. 

Q: Why?  

A: Well, because I knew that were the ones that  
would kill the Jews Œ they would kill us, and we 
knew that.  

Q: We re you ever afraid when
 you were with these young German
 boys that you would let your 
guard down and say something 
that was inappropriat e? 
A: No, again we were ma ture enough. We  never we
re Œ feared that because we knew we would 
not let our guard down. And that includes my brot
her too. We knew what to say and what not to 
say. 

Q: Even Œ even at such a young age? 

A: Yes, yes we did. And we also knew that we we
re not to expose ourselves
 in a restroom or so 
forth, because we knew if we did we would be dead.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Fred Taucher. This is tape numbe
r two, side A. Just exactly wa-was this cabin Œ 
where was this cabin loca ted?  

A: Okay, it was east of Spandau and the place wa
s called Berger Uplager(ph). And again, to get 
there you had to actually walk, probably worth a 
20 or 30 mi nute walk from 
the train station, and 
right in the mi dst of a forest. And that wa
s the name of the place, Berger Uplager(ph). 

Q: What was the atmosphere like there among th
e Œ the SS families, the women and the children, 
what is Œ was it a joyous atmo
sphere, a relaxed atmosphere? 
A: Very joyous and a relaxed atmosphere. Again, 
these were all, like I said earlier, SS. They had 
the food, they had everything. And you didn™t th
ink there was a war going on, to them.  
Q: Did the SS people come  to visit? 

A: No, they didn™t, because agai
n they knew to Œ as far as they
 knew, our father was in the 
Russian front and Œ and my mother always s
howed like she was so sad, she didn't know where 
Father was exactly, that they pretty much left 
her alone, as far as I can
 remember. And we didn't 
mi x too much with the Œ and most of them didn™t 
even have kids there, and Œ because again they 

were probably, most of t he people th
ere were in their late 30™s, ear
ly 40™s and they had kids who 
are Œ probably were in se Œ in Seattle, I almost 
said. They were probably 
in Berlin taking training 
in the Hitler youth, because they 
were all Hitler youth age.  
Q: So you really didn™t 
talk to the adults? 
A: Very little. I cannot really reme mber it. I™m 
sure we did, but again th
ere™s so many blanks. 
I™m sure we did but I can™t
 Œ I just cannot reme mber. 

Q: And you did not know at that tim
e what happened to your father. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
29 
 
A: No, we knew he was in Auschwitz because he 
wrote, right after he was arrest ed he wrote a 
postcard and said that he is in Auschwitz, thi
ngs are going fine  and will see you all when I get 
back. And that™s the Œ and this postcard was wr
itten to this mi dwife and she was a little 
concerned that they would watch her because  she 
got a letter from a Jew. But again, with her 

affiliation with the SS and with Hitler, they never did anythi ng.  

Q: What did she do Œ what did she do, this woma
n, Frau Noe-Noelting, as a job?  As work, as an 

occupation. I know she was a mi dwi fe, is
 that what she continued to do? 
A: Yes, she continued being a mi dwife and sh
e brought a lot of kids into this world. 
Q: But as a me mber of a  Nazi party Œ of the Œ of
 the Nazi party, did she 
have any specific duties?  
Or she was just a good Nazi? 

A: She was just a good friend of Hitler and some
 of the other people, 
but she did not like 
Hi mmler, Goering or Goebbels. Sh
e said they™re Œ those are the pe
ople that are at fault what is 
being done to the Jews, and as soon as Hitler kno
ws about it, it™ll st op. In the meantime, she did 
her job as a mi dwife. I do reme mber that. 

Q: Did she ever see Hitler during th
e time that you were with her? 
A: I don™t believe she did. She tried to, but he was 
so busy that he just di
dn™t have time  to see 
her. But I do know she has ma de 
attempts to talk with Hitler. 
Q: How did she get this connect
ion, was it through her family? 

A: I do not know. I do not know how she and Hitler 
became friends, but likeI said earlier, there 
were pictures of her and Hitler together, even Hi
tler had her Œ his arm around her in pi ctures of 
that. How they became friends, I have no idea. 

Q: So then you left this first location because she 
told you it wasn™t safe to stay and then where 
did you go? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
30 
 
A: Again, sa Œ I Œ we lived in different plac
es throughout Berlin, wher
e I do not know. But then 
even that got a little bad Œ 
Q: You went back to the city then? 

A: To the city. We  went back to
 the city of Berlin. But then 
Œ things got bad, but again this 
mi dwife found another fa mily that was wiped out, by the name of Schmitz. And it so happened 

this woma n had children, two boys, almost our ag
e and they wi  Œ they looked a li Œ somewhat 

like us. So we actually took their I.
D., pictures of them, and we m
oved to a reso-sort area in Binz 
auf Rügen. It™s a eastern part of Germany and my 
mother had a job there as a Œ as a ma id at one 
of the Œ at a big hotel again, where soldiers t
ook their own rest and re
cuperation. And she was Œ 
my mother became a maid over there, and had an 
income . But again, after about four months we 
had to move, because again, school. We didn't dare
 go to school. In fact there was a time where 

all the German kids had to work out on a farm 
and pick vegetables and 
things, so there was no 
school. And so my brother and I were out there 
with the other German kids, boys and girls, 
pulling vegetables and things like that. But then
 it got Œ school starte
d and we had to move 
because we didn™t da re go to school again. And so 
we went back to Berlin, again this mi dwife, 

she ma iled Œ via ma il she sent us the proper documen
ts that we needed in case there™s an I.D. 

check. But at that time we almost has the prope
r I.D. for Hitler youth. But we were lucky that 
there was no I.D. check on our way to Berli
n, back from Binz auf Raden(ph) on the train, 
because we would have been caught of the Œ it 
wa s very, very, very scary when we went in 
public transportation. But we ended up back in Berl
in. I think we kept that identification until the 
end of the war, the Œ by the name  of Schmitz. 
I don™t reme mber what first name  we had, but 
again we mo ved from area to area and then, I don™t know where now, in 1945, let™s say Œ  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
31 
 
Q: Well, le-let™s wait a littl
e bit. Did you have any kind of 
a shorthand communications wi Œ 
communication system with your brother, so if 
you were out together an
d there was a problem, 
you could kind of signal him?  Do you know wha t  I™m
 saying?  So you wouldn™t have to talk, but 
you could Œ either with your eyes, or ar Œ in Œ 
anyway Œ or hands, or with your mother?  Any Œ do 
you know what I™m saying?  Any kind of back-up 
protection if things 
got really bad and you 
really couldn™t say it openly. 
A: Yes, we had some  notes. For instance, if we 
Œ if one of us, my mother, brother or I noticed 

some thing that could be a possible Gestapo chec
king for I.D., if we thought it was, we™d ma ke 

some  hand notes and we slowly in
 di Œ different pe Œ 
not together, we™d disappear. Because some  
there, sometimes you could almost guess it. We got 
so we could feel that that was a Ge stapo. 

Q: So you had hand mot i ons? 

A: Yeah, we had the hand motions and then we™d
 me Œ le-leave one at a time, and we wouldn™t 
ha Œ never go into a restroom, because they Œ th
ey caught a lot of il Œ so full Œ so-called illegal 
people in restrooms. And so we usually stayed out
 and tried to move away
 within two or  three 
blocks from where we were at, then we™d get back 
together. Yes, we Œ we di
d have that, just like 
we always had a meeting place if we got separated. 

Q: Wherever you were. Was this 
Œ did this change day by day? 
A: Not day by day but ma ybe every 
third da y we™d say, well, if we
 get separated, let™s meet at 
this train station, or lets meet at this 
building. We  always decided on a place to meet. 
Q: So you Œ well then what Œ again, what did 
you and your brother do du
ring the day while the 
other children were at school?  
You Œ you are 11 and he™s 12. 
A: Right.  

Q: [sneezes] Excuse me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
32 
 
A: Yeah, again, I d Œ I don™t reme mber. I just 
don™t know what we did. We™d walk. Of course 
now you know you had air raids almost daily. The 
U.S. used to bomb daytime, the British 
bombed at night and we spend a lot of time in ai
r raid shelters. Especially when we™re g Œ now 
going to 1944, a lot of our time was 
spent in ai r raid shelters.  
Q: Did you go to church? 
A: No, we never did go to a church, and of course
 temples were not available. But we Œ we did 
not. 

Q: Why didn't you go to church to
 show you™re a good Christian.  
A: We  Œ I don™t think we were at places long 
enough, but for some  reason we never did. Again, 
our mother must have had a 
reason not to go to a church. 

Q: Di-Did she always provide enough food for you? 

A: We ll, she tried to, but there were time s Œ th
ere were times where we didn™t have anything to 
eat for two or three days. It was not easy. TheŒ probably where we had most of the food where 
we did not starve was that short 
time  that we lived in that summer cabin in Berlin and also when 
we were in that hotel, this resort hotel in 
Binz auf Rügen. There was had ample food. Again, I 
think my mo ther took it fr om the kitchen at times. 
Q: When you walked down the street in Berlin, 
were you aware that there were other Jews on the 
street who were hiding?  Did 
you sense other Jews being near
by who were under false papers? 
A: No, could not tell. We did not. I™m sure th
ere were and they proba
bly didn™t know we were 
Jewish. No, I ba Œ I believe that the Œ the Je
ws that were living like we were, under false Œ 
assume d na me s and so forth, did not know
 anyone else that was in hiding.  

Q: Di Œ had she delivered any other Jewish babies? 

A: I do not know, I don™t think so. I think I was 
probably the only one that
 she had delivered. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
33 
 
Q: Did you know if she sheltered other Jews? 
A: Definitely not. I know we were the only ones. 

Q: How do you know that? 

A: She™d say that, she™d tell my mother that. 
She said, you are the only ones I am helping and I 
know that if Hitler 
catches me, he™ll free me and everythi ng 
will be by Œ will be forgiven and the 
concentration camps would be elim
inated once Hitler knew about it. 
Q: Did she tell any of her fa m
ily or her friends about you? 
A: She had an adopted daughter, and she™s the on
ly one that knew. And her daughter was in the 
photography business and I think she 
developed things against Œ for 
the Œ for the Nazis. Pictures 
that were taken an that were ma ybe tough to Œ to really ma ke a good picture out of, she was able 

to i-improve the Œ the pictures of it. I m
ean, you know, photography was s
till not too good at the 
time. In fact, she would even color them if th
ey wanted colored pictures. She would actually 
ma nually color the pictures. And, but again, she 
kept her mouth shut, and she was the only one 
that knew that we were Jewish. 

Q: And wha t  was her name  and 
did you have contact with her? 
A: Yes, m Œ in fact, my brot
her saw Œ visited her when he 
was stationed in the army in 
Heidelberg. 

Q: No, I mean, during the 40™s wer 
Œ did you have contact with her? 
A: Yes, I did have contact. In fact, this one 
picture that I showed to you here, she took that. 

Q: I meant during the war. 

A: During the war, yes, we did. In fact, she liv
ed with g Œ Noelting in Berlin, in Schöneberg. 
Q: What was her name? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
34 
 
A: Traute, t-r-a-u-t-e, I think 
it was Holinova, h-o-l-i-n-o-v-a. 
I could be wrong on the spelling. 
But she too has died now.  
Q: So, did you stay in different places once you 
were back in Berlin, or did you move around? 
A: We move d around all the time and until the 
beginni Œ beginning of 1945 when we lived in 
different subway stations.  

Q: Why wer en™t you in an apartment? 

A: We ll, it got so that we didn™t know where to go any more and the bombing was ak Œ like I 

said earlier, day and night. And the shelters, 
the bomb shelters were 
overcrowded. We couldn™t 
get in, and to be in a bomb shelter again as 
ki ds, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we 
didn™t have. And we were afraid to
 be caught in a bomb shelter, so
 we stayed in subway stations, 
which a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, 
because the subway stations were pretty deep 
down and they were probably one of the safest places to be  until be f Œ the day before the 

Russians came in. 
Q: Did people question you on the street why you weren't in a Hitler youth uniform?  Did 
anybody ever ask you? 

A: Only once I can reme mber where I was asked,
 why aren™t you in uniform, I™d say it™s being 
cleaned. And that™s the only time I was ever asked.  

Q: So what did you do during the day? 

A: I wished I could give you an answer for th
at, I do not re Œ I do not reme mber. I don™t know 
what we did. 

Q: And you still thought your
 father was alive? 
A: Yes, we did, yes. Again, our father had us co
nvinced that he being American, they™ll give him 
a bad time, but he™ll be released. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
35 
 
Q: What was your mother™s state of mi nd?  
A: She too thought that he would 
be freed. She definitely did. 
Q: Was she calm during this time?  What 
Œ how would you describe this wo ma n? 
A: She Œ to us she was very calm, and always th
e Œ things will get bette
r, don™t fear. We™ll be 
together  with the father, then we™ll go to Americ
a and so forth. To us she was calm, but I™m sure 
she was in constant fear. I™m just certain about it. 

Q: Then she had no contact with an
y other Jews as far as you know? 
A: As far as I know, no. I know there was a Œ a
nother person, not Jewish, who helped us out 
quite a bit, he was a doctor and also analyzed x
-rays and so forth, he had a x-ray business. And 
he Œ he was an M.D. and I think the was partly
 the underground, because th Œ he was arrested at 
the tail end of the war. And I know 
he is the one that gave my mo
ther quite a bit of infor mation, 
and where we can stay and where we could not st
ay. But other than that, my wa Œ mo ther didn™t 
have too mu ch contact with anyone else.  
Q: Ho-How did she get in contact 
with him and what was his name ?  
A: I do not know his name and I don™t know how they
 got into contact, I Œ I do not reme mber it. 
I do not even know wha t  part of Berlin that 
was, but I do reme mber having gone there a couple 
of times, ma ybe even mo re than 
that. But I do not know the name. 
Q: So now you™re sleeping in the subway station. 

A: Right. 

Q: How do you sleep in this Œ 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: H-How do you sleep in the subway station? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
36 
 
A: We ll again, we were kids and we™d just go 
on a bench and lie down on a bench. It was very 
cold at times, but you got used to that. 
Q: Did you feel very old going thro
ugh these terrifying experiences? 
A: We ll, let™s put it this way, I did not feel like
 a 10 - 11 or 12 year old. We grew up, we ma tured 
very, very early in life. And yes,
 I see other Œ I would see other 
10 year old and I see how Œ what 
a child they were and I say, they must be a lot younger than me . I do recall that. 

Q: Did you feel very German th
en, or very Jewish, or both? 

A: Some times I felt German. I had to feel Germanin order to save myse lf, but I Œ deep inside I 

felt Jewish, yes, definitely. 

Q: We re you angry then that you were Jewish an
d so you had to go through all these terrible Œ 
this terr ible ordeal? 

A: No, I was not angry, I was just wishing why 
can™t we be like anyone else. I was not angry 
being Jewish, no, but I just was wishing I could be
 Œ that this discrimi
nation against the Jews 
wouldn™t be, that it would stop. And why a m I diffe
rent than any other Ge rman kid?  I Œ ma ybe I 
regretted it, but 
I was not angry. 
Q: And Œ and then what? So you Œ you Œ as I said
, you were living in the 
subway station until? 
A: Until the end of the war. Actually, what happened is we were at  one subway station, and all of 

a sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing 
through there. And all the people that were 
at that station started mo ving Œ the s-subways we
re not running Œ on the tr
acks to another station. 
And very few of us had anything 
to eat or to drink. Some  people 
started drinking the water that 
was stuving Œ comi ng through, and most of those pe
ople actually died due 
to diseases, I think 
typhoid or whatever it brought. And there were ti
me s my brother and I were going to drink it, 
and we kind of kept each other fr
om drinking it. We knew that th
at is dirty, we™re not going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
37 
 
drink it. And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next station, which was not 
flooded then. And we probably spent Œ and my Œ our
 mother was still alive then, and Œ who kind 
of kept us, too, from drinking it. And we got to
 the other station that 
was not flooded, and Œ but 
we needed water, and so my mother went outsi
de the station upstairs to
 a fire hydrant to get 
water. And she didn't come  back down. And I we
nt up and I do reme mbe r  seeing her lying at the 
fire hydrant. And actually she 
was killed, I don™t know if it was 
German or Russians, but the 
crossfire between the Russians and the Germans. A
nd so Œ and I never could get the water, I was 
forced to go back down into the subway station 
by German sol diers. I was a kid, and he forced 
me  to go ba ck down. And I would say that same  
day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came  
into that subway station with Tommy guns
 Œ ma chine guns in each hand and everyone Œ 
everyone down in that subway tunnel started cla
pping. There were a few German sol diers there, 
they threw down their weapons and surrendered to
 those two Russian sold
iers. And again, this 
was at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no
 longer a subway station, but th
e station is still there as a Œ 
a me morial, so to speak. And that was th
e end of the war for us. And we then Œ 
Q: Let Œ let Œ let™s go back a little bit. I™m 
sure it™s painful, but you come  upstairs and you see 
your mother Œ 

A: It was very [indecipherable] 

Q: Œan-and how did you break 
the news to your brother? 
A: Okay, at the time  I didn™t know if she really wa
s dead or just injured. 
And I told my brother I 
saw our mot her, she was up at the fire hydrant, bu
t the Germans wouldn™t let me get to it, and I 
think she is okay, but I don™t know
. That™s really what I told 
him. And I didn™t know, I Œ it was 
just the way I felt. And of course we never did 
see her again. And, in fact, up to this day, I do not 
know if she was killed or injured because the 
Russians took a lot of Œ especially wome n and 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
38 
 
children, they loaded them on truck and s-shippe
d them to Rus s ia, especially wome n. In fact, 
after the war my brother and I were loaded onto 
trucks ma ny times to be Œ to go to Russia, but 
we knew Be rlin like a book, we Œ 
there wasn™t an address we c
ouldn™t find. And we, for awhile 
were guides to some  of t he Russian o
fficers going from point A to point B. 
Q: Previous to you losing your mo
ther, were di Œ di Œ wasn™t th
ere a situation where you were 
taken away? 
A: Yes. We didn™t Œ we didn™t 
cover that. Yes, again, like I 
said, we move d around freely under 
false I.D., and again in a street
car, and I was there by myself. I think I may have been on my wa y 
to this mi dwife, Noelting, because she had some
 groceries for us. And we™d do that, some ti me s 
my brother went to see her. And this was on April 15
th
, 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the 
reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D. 

check and I had the I.D., I was Œ I don™t reme mb
er the fi rst name, the last name was Schmitz. 
But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. 
So again, they make you drop the pant s and they 
knew pretty much if you didn™t ha ve the Hitler yo
uth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a 
12 year old having to drop their pants in front
 of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And 
of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they
 Œ I was arrested. They tied me  up, my hands 
behind my back, very tightly and they took me  
to Prinz-Albrecht-Stra
sse 9. That was the SS 
headquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where th
ey questioned people, 
not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or 
others that  talked against the regime, they were 
tortured at that place. And again, according to 
the archives Œ the archives in Germany do not s-
say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15
th
. It only showed that on April 17
th
, I was 
shipped to Dachau on a t Œ railcar, a train. We
ll, fo r t Œ two days there, between the 15
th
 and the 
17
th
, I was tortured, but they didn™t ge t any info
rmation out of me  because they beat me  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
39 
 
things they did, pulling teeth ou
t, I have dentures. Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or 
anything, and usually I™d pass out, and they finally 
gave up and stuck me  in one of those trains. 
And that was April 17, according to the archives
. And I ended up, after two days roughly, i-in 
Dachau, which I believe was the only concentrati
on camp that still was open and there with a 
route between Berlin and Munich. 
And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left 
the train. The trai n, railcar that  I was in was mo
st ly Œ were mostly Russian soldiers, me n and 

wome n soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of
 kids my age in there and a few other wome n 
and me n, Germans, Jews , I do not know. Then th
ere were a whole bunch of people on the floor 
of the train that were already dead, or were tram
pled to death, or been 
there a lot l
onger. I don™t 
know how long they save , you know, kept the train in
 Berlin until it was full, completely full. So 
there were a number of people that I know were
 dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no 
sanitation facilities. And it was Œ it was the worst 
hell I™ve ever been i
n. And it was either  April 
19
th
 or April 20
th
, I do not know. Again, during th Œ fr Œ apar
 Œ from the records that were kept, I 
turned up mi ssing April 20
th
. It ma y have been th-the day be
fore. But during and air raid, there 
was an air raid, and some body during 
that air raid opened up the door 
of the railcar that we were 
in. Why, I don™t know. I kind of think is that th
e German gua rds Œ they we re SS, they were 
volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies 
were right outside the camp because Dachau was

. And this was let™s Œ let™s say this was April 20
th
. And so I think to be ma ybe 
he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figur
ed ma ybe they™d get better treatment. And so 
that door opened and whoever was strong enough
, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian 
soldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them 
t hat I followed, and it wasn™t too far. We ended 
up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few Ger ma n soldiers. They were 

not SS, they were Germa n soldiers, and they we
re teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a

rifle because at that time  now they made ev
erybody defend the Motherland Œ the Fatherland. And 
anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German so
ldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers 
were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, 
and they didn™t have no weapons. But in groups 
they just  attacked the Germans, a
nd like I say, over half were killed.

Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: Œ of the United States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection interview with Fred 
Taucher. This is tape number two, side B. 
A: Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar Œ overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though 

they had weapons, but they were so
 frightened, they just froze. Th
ey just looked in awe, and the 
Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, 
they killed every one of them. And t hen they 

started to move some place and I want ed to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can™t. 

And so what I did is I looked at
 the Hitler youth kids that were 
dead and took off the uniform of 
one of the kids that was my size and put on that
 uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks, 
because I knew there were old Autoba hn, the fr
eeway Œ not Œ not freeway, highway, was right 
next to the railara Œ railroad car. And so I walked
 towards there and I deci
ded to flag down a car. 
And the first car that went by was a German SS
 car, a Mercedes and tw
o SS officers were in. 
Well, they stopped, and I said I™m Œ I  need to go 
back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and 
Russians came  by and t hey killed everybody. I™m the 
only one that is left aline, and I want Œ a-
alive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet Œ 
and go to my mother. And they said come  on in, 
jump in, we have a me ssage for Hitler, that ™s wher e we™re going to. Now reme mber, I didn™t Œ 

the only language I knew was Ger man. I talked li
ke a German, I was German, except they didn't 
know I was a German Jew. There were numerous 
roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however, 
we were waived through every roadblock because 
they were again Œ I don™t know what rank they 
were, but they were high in the SS and they had 
a little sticker on the wind
shield, and they hardly 
even ever slowed down for a roadblock, it wa
s opened up for them to go through. And they 
dropped me  off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was Œ act
ually, that was our meeting place where we 
always said if we get separated, this is wher
e we meet, and Œ and every day we™d go and meet 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
42 
 
there. We ll, we got to Œ I got to Anhalter Ba
hnhof and there was my mother and brother who 
almost fainted when they saw me  in the Hitl
er youth uniform. But anyhow, this was Œ you see, 
it™s so close to the war and we 
did then go to the Noelting, the mi
dwife, we went to her home, 
and I did change clot hes. I didn™t dare stay in
 the Hitler youth uniform bec ause they could take 
me  like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave 
them a rifle to defend. So I didn™t want to be in 
the Hitler youth. In fact, I thi
nk my brother and I both, she put 
Band-Aids on our feet like we 
were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that™s really how we lived until the Russians 
came in. 

Q: How do you explain how you kept
 your equilibrium through all of this?  You were so young, 
you were 12 years old. Le t™s even go back to the ra
ilcar. We ll, no, let™s even go back previous to 
that, to how you were tortured. Ho-ho Œ you were 12 years old. 

A: That™s right. We ll, they were so animal-like.
 They had, like I say, after some  pain, I passed 
out. And by the time  Œ I was never Œ why I di
dn™t talk, I do not know, 
I cannot tell you that. 
Another thing I want to me ntion, 
which I think nowadays, I was so 
thin. I mean whe n Œ after the 
war, when we lived with the Russians, I thi
nk I weighed 50 some  pounds and my br other wasn™t 
much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride  with didn™t recognize th
a Œ how thin I was. I 
probably looked more like an eight 
year old than a 11 year old, but
 they didn™t see that. I think 
their whole thing was to get to 
Berlin to let Hitler Œ probably 
what I think happened is because 
they knew the allies were outside , probably to 
ask Hitler what should be done. They could have 

been general officers, I™m Œ I don™t know. But, I 
mean, we practically flew to Berlin. I mean, 
they drove that Mercedes as fast
 as it could be driven and of 
course they™re Œ the only vehicles 
you saw on the Autobahn were military vehicles.  

Q: And then when you were in the railcar, was that a cattle car? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
43 
 
A: It was a cattle car, and this is why even t
oday, right here at this mu
seum, I Œ I™ve been here 
four or five time s, I have never been able to step 
foot in that cattle car that is right here at this 
museu m. 
Q: How do you explain your keeping your comp osure,
 your sanity in a car like that, when you 
were Œ when you were going through it? 

A: We ll, I knew I was going to die. I knew my Œ th
at s Œ that I was caught, they™re taking me  to a 
concentration camp, I didn™t know which one and 
I knew the end of my life was near. And I 
accepted that. And of course my brother and my mo
ther, we all knew that we are living from day 
to day and it could be at any tim
e we could be arrested and put 
to a concentration camp. I me an, 
we knew our father went to Auschwitz, we 
knew that. Even though we thought, again, him being 
an American, he will survive. 

Q: Did you know what a concentration camp was? 

A: Yes, yes, we knew and we  knew they were gassing Jews. 
Q: How did you know that? 
A: It spread. I believe the Œ this mi dwife told us. But we knew, and th-the word spread. The 

Germans knew it. Of course they said they di
dn™t know, and now they all say they never knew, 
which is a lie. They all knew. And of course th
e way they beat people up
 into the railcars, I 
mean, not only Jews, also Jehovah Witness was 
one, gay people and of course Poles or other 
foreigners that were enemies of 
Germany. And they were just beat
en, literally beaten up into the 
railcars and squeezed together like cattle. 

Q: Did the older people in the ra
ilcar help you, as a 12 year old? 
A: No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped
 me and actually kept  me  fr om getting down on 
the ground, because they knew if I would fall, I w
ou Œ could be dead, because I™d be trampled 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
44 
 
on. And I will say the Russian Œ incide ntally, they
 treated me  well, and treated my brother well 
after they liberated Berlin.  
Q: But in the railcar? 

A: I-In the railcar they treated me very well. They kept me up and made sure that  I st and up and 

don™t try to lie down. And especially, I mean I Œ 
sleepy. You know, I was there at least two days, 
nothing to eat, nothing to drink. Bu
t they kept me from lying down. 
Q: Was it dark? 

A: Oh yes. There were Œ there wa
s some light comi ng in daytime, but
 very little. And with all the 
people stacked in, it was mostly dark. And it was 
still Œ well again, we were so close together. 
That™s one good thing, otherwise we would have 
been freezing. I mean April in Germany still 
gets Œ the nights get very cold. 

Q: Wa s it all me n, or was it me n and wome n?  

A: Men and wome n, me n and wome n. And it was very
 unpleasant. There are th
ings that Œ well, I 
was young enough really, I didn™t know about a 
woma n having a period. I didn™t know about 
that. Of course, that transpired
 there. And a lot of people had 
diarrhea, and again, no sanitation 
facilities. And it™s Œ that™s what went on there 
and I™m not the only one that suffered like that. 
And Œ but again, the railcar was pr
obably as wor Œ as bad as havi
ng been tortured, because in the 
torture, so much of it, I passed out. And though I w
oke up with pain, but still, the railcar was the 
worst thing that could have any Œ happened to anybody. 

Q: Besides the Russian soldiers being of help
 to you, did you sense that people were helping 
others?  Other people were helping Œ 

A: You me a n in the railcar? 

Q: Œ other victims in the railcar? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
45 
 
A: No, I think Œ I think most of them were 
in there much longer and were too weak to do 
anything. And I think the Russian so
ldiers that helped me  and were helpful, I think were c-caught 
on the eastern part of Berlin, wh
ich the Russian came  in on. I th
ink they we re caught shortly Œ 
about the same  ti me  I was, or ma ybe it Œ two or 
three days sooner. But of course they were not 
tortured, they were just loaded on that railcar 
til it was comple tely fu
ll. But I don™t think they 
were in too long and were still st
rong enough to survive this ordeal. 
Q: What does death mean to a 12 year ol
d?  You said you knew you were going to die. 
A: It meant strictly, that™s it, you™re going to be 
Œ you™re going to be away from this world. It™s Œ 
to me , I knew death. Of course, reme mber, I saw 
my stepbrother kill himself. And I knew he was 
dead, he would never be alive agai
n. And that™s really what it mean
t to me, I™ll be just like Klaus, 
my s-stepbrother. 
Q: We re you afraid of death? 

A: No, that™s the thing. My brot
her, and I think this is probabl
y why he can™t reme mbe r  anything, 
he feared death, he Œ he feared the bombing. 
We  someti mes had to hold him or he would run 
right into the fire, practically. He
 feared death and I didn™t. I just
 took it one day at a time  and 
always took it, and I guess I still f
eel like that today. I mean, I spen
t time  in Korea and I just felt 
like, when the time comes, I Œ I™ll die. And I tho
ught my ti me was there when I was in the train, 
especially with all th
e dead people around me . 
Q: When you got back to your 
mother and your brother after th
e railcar, did you tell them what 
you went through, and the tortures? 

A: Yes, I told them wher e I was at, what happe
ned. And of course, my mo ther just cried and 
hugged me  a nd so thankful that I survived. And she suspected that is what had happened, 

because we had never been separated more than
 a Œ a day, neve r. No, I think one time, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
46 
 
mother couldn™t come  back and she was gone for one
 night, but then we 
got together again. But 
other than that we™ve always spen
t the nights togeth
er, wherever.  
Q: You were very, very quick thinking and quick
 witted to put on that Hitler youth uniform and 
flag down that car. What do you attribute that 
to?  That was a very br
illiant decision, and you 
were 12 years old. 

A: We ll Œ that™s right. Well, 
I think my brother would have 
done the same  thing. Again, ma ybe 
our mother brainwashed us in there Œ in this. 
And I think ma ybe this Frau Noelting told us 
whenever things like happen, what to do, I Œ I th
ink, but I just knew what I had to do, especially 
when I couldn™t follow the Russians and here I wa
s all alone. And Œ and I decided, well, the only 
way I™m goi ng to ma ke it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, a nd hoping that I wouldn™t be 

forced to take a rifle and start 
shooting. And again, I didn™
t know like, at the 
time  that the allies 
were out or the Œ outside the D
achau camp that the ger Œ Russians
 were outside, I didn™t know 
that. But I knew, we all knew the war was comi ng 
to an end, and we even knew that before I was 
arrested. We  knew it was the end of the war comi
ng. We ll, we knew that and th-the word spread. 
People, Germans that were against the regime  were
n't afraid to talk any more that much. And I 
used to hear people say, look at all those tanks
 there Œ to other peopl
e Œ look at those tanks, 
there™s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, th
ey™re out of gas. And so the Germans weren™t 
quite as afraid any more. But of course afte
rwards, and I Œ I do know wome n, I know me n that 
would say, oh we™re Œ we have a secret weapon. This
 just when the Russians were really fighting 

for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weap
ons and they going to take them, they™re going to 
kill the Œ all the Russians that are comi ng in. Th
ere were st ill those fanatics around and I heard 

wome n say, oh, if these Russians should come  i
n, I™m going to pour boiling water on them. And 
I™ll do everything, they™ll never get me , I™ll kill th
em, and so forth. Of co
urse, after the Russians 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
47 
 
came in, oh how sweet you are. And Œ and honestl
y, the Russians would wa Œ rape the wome n 
right out in daylight  in the street. Again, thi
ngs I didn™t know until it ca
me  true. And you know, I 
had no remo rse on those wome n that used to Œ I used
 to hear in the train 
station that they are 
going to kill the Russian, they are going to kni
fe them to death or they™re gonna put boiling 
waters on them. That™s how they felt then, and then
 they were friends. So, the Russians that came  
into Berlin were completely uneducated. They 
had no common sense, and they were Œ in fact, I 
wouldn™t be surprised if those were released pr
isoners, because the Russian Œ I think the front 
line soldiers were ma ybe from Siberia, or people 
that were politically ar
rested or other Œ some  
reason other arrest. And they were Œ they were 
not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they 
treated us we ll. And of Œ of course after Ber
lin was divided between the Russians, the French, 
the British and the U.S. troops, we then
 went to live with this mi dwife. 
Q: When Œ so you Œ le-let™s get back just 
chronologically, you Œ you Œ the ra Œ you found your 
mother, you saw that your mother had been shot. 
A: Right. 
Q: You ca me downstairs, you told your brothe
r and then the Russian soldiers came  in. 
A: Right. 

Q: And then what happened? 

A: What happened, we went to the Russian soldiers and we found some body that spoke German 

Œ no, we even found a Jewish soldier. We  f
ound a  Russian Jewish soldier who spook Œ spoke 
Yiddish. And so we communicated in Yiddish an
d said we were hungry and we told them we 
were Yiddish, right? And they gave us food, they ga
ve us water. They actually nourished us back 
a little bit. 

Q: Did you feel liberated at that mo ment? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
48 
 
A: Yes, we felt liberated. 
Q: And wha t  did that mean to you boys? 

A: Freedom, food. We  ca n talk freely. We  don™t have
 to worry about being arrested by the Nazis. 
We don™t have to worry about be
ing beaten or spit upon by other 
German kids. That™s what it 
meant, it just meant full freedom. And Œ and af
ter we receive d food and everythi ng from the 
Russians, we then Œ this Russian soldier, I don™t
 know what his rank was,
 or what, but he was Œ 
this Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated
 and we became  the guide to his officer, and 
showed him where to go in Berlin from point
 A to point B, because we knew it so well. 
Q: Wher-Where were you living? 

A: We  were still living with the Russians, very 
cl ose to this Anhalter Ba
hnhof, the train station 
where our mother was killed, we think. In fact, 
this soldier wa Œ by the time we went back 
outside the train station, our mo
ther was not Œ there was nobody by 
this fire hydrant. And that 
Jewish soldier did try to find our
 mot her, but couldn™t. So we do not know if she was taken to 
Russia or buried, or what.  

Q: And you s Œ you still exp
ected to find your father? 
A: Right. But then after Œ after 
the division between the Russians, the Œ and the Americans when 
Berlin was divided up in sectors, a
nd then we went to live with th
at mi dwife, we knew that Œ that 
Œ we found out that the people th
at were in concentration camp 
by that time  would have been 
back in Berlin or we would have known and our
 father would have known 
to get in touch with 
this mi dwife. And when he didn't Œ and the same  thing with our mother Œ we knew our mother Œ 

again, we didn't know, a nd of course, I still don™t
 know. Even today I don™t know if our mother 
died in this crossfire or  if she was sent to Russi
a, because the Russians did take thousa nds of Œ of 
kids and wome n to Russ ia. I™m sure you are aware of that. And so that, we  don™t know. We  did, 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
49 
 
before we came  to the U.S., we had to identify our mother, and we had to get a birth ad Œ a Œ a Œ 
a death certificate of our mother. And we said
 well, we don™t know. We ll, if you want to leave 
Germany you need to have a death certificate. 
So there were a whole bunch of people and so we 
just identified yes, that was our mother. They sh
owed us pictures of several people, I said yes, 
that™s our mother, so we could ge
t a death certificate. 
But if she really died
 there, we don™t know.  
Q: You stayed with the Russian soldiers Œ 

A: For a Œ 

Q: For how long? 

A: Well, I Œ I™m not sure. There must be records.
 When Œ whe n Berlin wa
s divided into the four 
sectors, it was until the division, 
we stayed with the Russians. One thing is, we were their guide, 
but trains didn™t run and things 
like this, until the di
vision really, and wa 
Œ there was no way we 
could have gotten to Schöneberg to the Œ to th
e mi dwife, and we didn™
t even know if she was 
still alive or  Œ or what. But it was after the di
-division that we went 
to Schöneberg, to the 
mi d w i f e .   

Q: Before that did you meet with people Œ meet
 people who had also been in hiding, other Jews? 
A: We ll, you saw the picture of the syna
gogue, but no that was Œ no, I didn™t, no. 
Q: I-I meant in the very beginning, after liberation. 

A: At the very beginning no, we did not meet a
nyone that was in hiding. 
No, I™m co Œ incorrect 
there. I know of about two or th
ree people that also received th
is concentration camp I.D. that 
were not in hiding, that were out
 of concentration camps, be cause the Russian governme nt, or the 
Russian military produced these I.D.™s that we were in concentration camp very close to where I 

was at at that Anhalter Bahnhof. And I Œ I did meet
 two or three people, el
derly people that did 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
50 
 
get out of a concentration camp a
nd also received this I.D. But as
 far as people that we re living 
in hiding, at that time no, I 
ha Œ did not meet anyone.  
Q: So then you Œ you went back to this woma n Œ 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- the Œ the mi dwife? 

A: To the midwife. And of course Œ she actua
lly signed us up, we did go to a German s c hool 
there after the war for a 
little bit, but not very 
long, about two months. 
Q: She was willing to take you back in? 

A: Yes, she took us back in and Œ 

Q: Did you assume  your old name s, your real name s?  

A: Yes, we Œ we assume d our real name  and sh
e even provide d clothi ng for us because  we wore 
practically rags. But we weren™t the only Ge
rma ns that wore rags, you couldn™t buy clothing 
during the war. But anyhow, she got us some  cl
othing and signed us up to a school. And I think 
she started me  in the second grade and my brot
her in the third grade in Ge rmany. But  we only 

went to that school for about a month or two, an
d then the Br itish militar
y, they inherited what 
used to be a Œ a rest and cu Œ 
recuperation camp outside of Berli
n, about three or four hours drive 
out of Berlin in Lüneburg, and where the German
s had a rest and recuperation camp. And they 
took a bunch of Œ at that time now, kids that were 
either in hiding or in 
concentration camp, they 
looked those people up, including my 
brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to 

this former [indecipherable] camp in Lünebur
g, where we were nursed Œ we were given 

complete physical examinations and we were nurse
d back into health. An
d that is straight Œ 
before we went to that camp, my
 brother and I then got to know
 some of the Jewish American 
soldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this on
e, We rner Nathan was his name , a private in 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
51 
 
the U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually 
was responsible in opening up that synagogue at 
Rosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got 
the Joint Dist ri bution Committee in touc h with us, 
who sponsored us to come  to the St ates. We ll, trying to. And while we were waiting to co-come 
to the U.S., we went to this rest  camp that th
e British sponsored, that should have been for, I 
think eight weeks. For two months. Well, we we
re there about three months when a American 
soldier, not Werner Nathan, some  other American
 soldier came , looked for us and says we are 
going to be comi ng to the United States. We  have our Œ our visas and we™re going to come  to the 

U.S. So we l e ft that camp early, went back to 
Berlin and he drove us b
ack to Berlin and I don™t 
know if it was a private vehicle or U.
S. Ar my ve hicle, I don™t reme mber. 
Q: When you were in this rest
 camp, there were other Jewish 
children, did you talk and compare 
stories?  

A: No. Nobody wanted to talk about it. They didn™t really want to talk about it, including me . We  

just survived, and some  of th
em were living in conditions 
like Œ you know, ma ybe in a ceiling 
some place and never saw daylight. Or some how 
that they had Œ ma ybe people hid them, and 
really hid them. And mo  Œ and lo
t of the kids I know were in 
Œ out in farms someplace. And Œ 
but again, lived in hiding where nobody knew that 
they were in that Œ a farmhouse. And Œ but 

nobody really wanted to talk about it too much. 

Q: What do you attribute that to? 

A: I don™t think Œ even me at the time, I was s
till thinking, is this real?  
Am I really free?  And 
yeah Œ and nobody asked. I ma y me nt ion some thi
ng here. Two years ago I met a woman, she too 
was in this rest camp. We me t each other in Pr
ague at the Child Survivors of the Holocaust 

conference. And Œ but if Œ we just didn™t talk abou
t it. And when I went back to Berlin after they 
rescue Œ recuperating, and my brot
her and I, and we told the mi
dwife, Frau Noelting that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
52 
 
were going to America. And oh, she was upset. 
She says, you™re German, you can™t go. But we 
did. 
Q: T-Tell me  more in detail how you me t We rner Nathan. 

A: After the Œ Berlin was divided, again our fath
er being an American and being pretty much 
told that we™re going to come  to Œ go to Ameri
ca some  day, we went to a U.S. Ar my camp. And 

where we lived in Schöneberg was the w Œ Ame r
ican sector, fortunately enough. And so we just 
went to an army ca mp a nd we started telling at 
the front gate really, is
 there anybody here that 
speaks German?  And most of them don™t, you know, a
nd Œ and says yes, and they called this one 
private out, which was Werner Nathan. He is ori Œ 
was originally from Austria and they went to 
the States before the war. If he
 is alive he™d be in his 80™s now
. And anyhow, we talked with him 
Œ and he was very Orthodox, too. And he says, 
well he™s in the proce
ss of finding a synagogue 
and they found a synagogue, the only synagogue in Be
rlin that was not burned. And that he was 
opening up that synagogue for Rosh Hashanah. And that™s really how we me t hi m.  
Q: So he stayed in contact with you fr om that day on? 
A: That™s right. And he is the one that contact
ed the Joint Dist ribution Committee in New York. 
Q: Did you go to the Rosh Hashanah services? 

A: Yes. This is a picture, and he
re is my brother and I at the Ro
sh Hashanah services right here 
in this pi ct ure. 

Q: What were your thought
s during that service? 
A: Thanking God that we are aliv
e, and Œ and afterwards this so 
Œ We rner Nathan forced us to 
study a little bit more Hebrew, and the various prayers. And I think it was a month or two later 

that we Œ maybe not even that long, I don™t know 
exactly, is when we became  Bar Mitzvah. My 
brother and I were the first two Jewish boys

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Fred Taucher. This is tape numbe
r three, side A, and you had begun to talk about 
preparing for your Bar Mitzvah. 

A: Right, well, having been away from really, th
e Jewish religion for all these war years, we 
were taught by this Ame r ican serviceman, w
ho was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as 

much as a rabbi, and he ma de sure that we lear
ned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar 
Mitzvah. And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of 

the Jewish chaplains fr  Œ chaplains fro m his 
Ame r ican compa ny in the army and we were 

officially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the va
rious prayers. And I do not know the exactly Œ 
exact date, but I would say it was some  ti me  
in 1946 and probably I would Œ I™m guessing now, 
between March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau Œ 

Q: So you were already 13, cause you were 13 in January. 
A: Ah, no I wa Œ that™s correct, I was 13 in Januar
y, so I was th Œ that™s right, I was 13 and my 
brother was 14. And of c ourse, he was a year
 late before he co
uld be Bar Mitzvah. 
Q: Did you want to have a Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Yes, we™ve always wanted to be Bar Mitz
vah. I mean, even though we were never very 
religious, we  were very conservative, but it 
was always our parents 
saying that when Œ I 
reme mber always saying when my brother beco
mes 13 years old he™s going to be a man, he™s 
going to be Bar Mitzvah. And the same  thing wa s 
true with me . And yes, 
I did want to be Bar 
Mitzvah and we were very proud when we became  Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: Can you describe what you did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
55 
 
A: No, that I do not reme mber. I do not reme mber
, but I know there was a big party afterwards, 
at that synagogue, and it was a Œ a day of celebra
tion, but what we did, I 
do not reme mber, but it 
was probably the most enjoyable time in our
 lives, from the day I can remember.  

Q: Who came to the service? 

A: A lot of Jewish, as well Œ Jewish U.S. sold
iers, Russian soldiers and I™m not sure but I Œ 
something in my back of the mi nd, I  Œ I™m su
re that the mi dwife™s stepdaughter, who was a 
photographer, I believe she took pictures. I do not ha
ve any of those pictur
es, but I b Œ do believe 
she was there taking pictures. And th
at™s all I can really remember.  
Q: Wa s it difficult not having your pa
rents there at your Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Of course it was. We  mi ssed our mother, we 
wished our father could have been there even 
though we knew the fact that he was dead and pe
rished in Auschwitz. And so we Œ but we did 
mi ss our mo ther and again in Œ in
 th Œ at that  time we still 
were not sure, we did not know 
whether she was still alive, or Œ 
or dead. We  didn™t know that, so 
yes, it wa s very, very hard not 
having our mother there, though 
we celebrated, it was joyous. But we still wished that our 
mother could have been there. 

Q: Were you trying to locate your 
mother still, at that point? 
A: Oh yes, all the time, we Œ whenever we lear
ned of a place that had records, and regardless 
what section, whether it Œ whet
her it was French, British or  what, we™d go over ther e and see if 
we could find anything on our mother. Bu t we, of course, never found anything. 

Q: Did Gertrude Noelting come  to y
our Bar Mitzvah, or just her daughter? 
A: I do not recall her comi ng, but I Œ I™m not 100 percent sure if her daughter came, but I Œ I 

really believe she did come  and took fi Œ pictures, but I™m almost posit
ive that Fr au Noelting 
never did come  to it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
56 
 
Q: So d Œ and you had the celebra
tion at the synagogue itself? 
A: That is correct, they had a bi
g celebration that we had food, a
nd we had fruits that we haven™t 
Œ had never seen, like a banana. We almost didn™
t know how to peel a banana and I believe we 
had banana the first time since the war. I do reme mber that. 
Q: And your relationship with your 
brother then, did it Œ it was sti
ll as intensely close as it had 
been during the war? 

A: Oh, very much so. We™ve been very close, even though after we got older and came to the 

U.S., just like brothers one year
 apart used to fight and argue,
 which we did, too, but still we 
were very close and even today we™re still very close. 

Q: And did you two talk about the wa rtime at 
that Œ in 1946, did you talk about the previous 
years?   

A: No, we never did, even when we came to the 
States, we hardly ever talked about the war 
years. It™s some thing that Œ and it was probably 
more so my brother than me. He just did not 
want to talk about it and so 
I didn™t. He Œ he took the whole 
thing a lot harder than I did, I 
believe.  

Q: And in order to get food you said you had this 
folder, this camp folder, the red Œ the red side 
of Œ 

A: Oh, oh, oh, that, yes, most peopl
e that were Œ that have surviv
ed from a  concentration camp, 
that were in a concentration camp, fi rst in Berlin
 were given a little identification by the Russian 
soldiers, it was in German and Russian, indicatin
g that we were discrimi nated against and have 
survived a concentration camp. 
And it was a red sheet of pape
r with the concentration camp 
logo. And once we Œ if Œ when we held that ce
rtificate going through line
s, buying food or other 
items, we could just hold that and could go to 
the front of the line. A
nd there was not a single 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
57 
 
German that ever complained, us going to the fron
t of the line. In fact, th
ey turned the other way, 
they didn™t even want to see this concentra
tion camp logo, they all knew what it was. And we 
had full privileges, even when we took a train. Shor
tly after the war, some  
of the trains started 
running again in Berlin, and we c
ould go to the train, never had to 
pay to ride the trains, I mean 
we had a free hand in Ber
lin right after the war. 
Q: We re you able to go back to your 
original house, orig
inal apartment? 
A: The original apartment Œ well, the apartmen
t where th Œ I call it the ghetto type of a 
apartment, where we were forced to live, that 
wa s bombed out. That was no longer in existence. 
However, both of the stores, the first store that I 
reme mber as a very small child, that my father 
had in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse and not very far, co
uple of blocks from there in Leipne(ph) strasse, 
which was the street where Œ that suffered from t he Kristallnacht, that st or e was still in existence. 
And I don™t recall us visiting either 
one of those stores right after th
e war, before we came  to the 
States. But I went back to Berlin for my first 
time in 1975, I believe, and I 
did visit that store. 
And it didn™t change much, and I just, a year ago in berli Œ in April, a year ago when I was in 

Berlin, I did visit it and of course
 there™s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one 
on Petsaloz zi(ph) st rasse, there was a Chinese fam
ily living there and also they had a store of 
Chinese artifacts and souvenir type 
items. In fact, I stopped and talked with them. Their son, it so 
happened, graduated from the University of Cali
fornia, spoke pretty good 
English and I talked 
with him for  probably close to an hour. And he 
found it very interesting 
that as a child I was 
living at that place, at a Œ it did some Œ was 
some major remo deling done and more space. Well, 
we had two bedrooms a nd a kitchen and a bathroom 
in that store when we lived ther e before the 
Kristallnacht. A-And now it had some  much nicer
 and more roomy type of bedrooms and it was 
almost like a very comfortabl e type of an apartment.

58 
 
Q: When you were with Œ studyi
ng with this young American so
ldier, was he helping other 
Jewish childr en? 
A: If he was, I™m not aware of it. I don™t think so
 because he still was a soldier and I think he was 
a company c ook and he still had to do his duties ther
e and in his off ti me  he worked with us. So I 
doubt very much that he helped others, becaus
e we were not as a group. He worked with us 
strictly as individuals. 

Q: Did you learn English then? 

A: No, we did not. We  Œ the only word of E
nglish I knew was hello, goodbye and where™s the 
bathroom?  And thank you. I think my brother 
learned a few more words of English. But 

incidentally, both my br other and I were able 
to communicate in Russia
n. We  were not fluent, 
but we were able to communicate in Russian pr
etty good, because we™ve lived with the Russians 
for about 90 days. 

Q: And you were able to pick
 up the ru Œ Russian language? 
A: That™s right. We  were able to, and like 
I say, communicate and pi
ck up, right. I have 
completely forgotten it, I still know a few word
s, but I could not carry on a conversation and I 
can understand very little. 

Q: And then how much longer did you st
ay in Germany after your Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Okay, again, I think the Bar Mitzvah was in
 the spring of 1946 and we left Berlin in 
September 1946. 

Q: I forgot to ask you an important questi
on, did you get any gifts for your Bar Mitzvah? 
A: I don™t believe we did. I don™t re
call that we received any gifts.
 We  were just so happy to be 
amongst our own without fear of bei
ng arrested. That was a gift alone. 
Q: Absolutely. Did you feel connected
 to the Russian Jewish soldiers? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
59 
 
A: At the time, yes. The  Œ we didn™t meet too ma
ny of them, but yes, they
 treated us well, and I 
was some what connected, but not as much as 
once the Americans came in. I mean, we didn't 
even keep track of the Russian and Je wish so
ldiers, except some  of 
them were at the Bar 
Mitzvah. But we pretty much got connected to th
e American Jewish soldiers, both enlisted me n 
as well as officers. I even reme mber some of th
e name s, Lieutenant Nowalski(ph), who helped us 
out, and there were a few other officers. And 
the only name s I can reme mber was Lieutenant 
Nowalski(ph) and Private We rner Nathan. 
Q: Important name s. And the name  of the synagogue, you said you™re not sure? 

A: No, I wished I would know. I don™t know the 
address, I Œ I do not know the name , but I do 
know it was the only synagogue not burned 
out, not burned by the Germans.  
Q: What was your relationship with the German ch
ildren your age, the non-
Jewish chil-children?  
Did they talk to you, did you play with them, 
did you do anything with them?  After the war. 

A: After the war?  We ll again, we went to school 
for two or three months after the war, and we 
played with them and I still sensed there was so
me prejudice towards the Jews by some of them. 
But like I have shown you this Œ th
is is Œ the funny thing is is 
how I knew there was a write-up in 
this British ma gazine, The Illustrated. And there we
re Œ was a picture of my brother and I in that 
Illustrated. It was a German ki
d whose parents knew English and 
subscribed to that magazine. 
And they are the ones that showed us th
at ma gazine with our pictures in it. 
Q: Right. You™re talking about the October 6
th
, 1945 issue of The Illustrated? 
A: That is the issue I am talk
ing about. And it was really one 
Jewish boy that was in our class 
after the war, in Berlin, that brought that 
ma gazine to school and showed it to us. 
Q: Mm-hm. And so you s Œ how Œ you said you sensed
 some  prejudice on the part of the German 
children. How Œ an-an-and can you give an example? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
60 
 
A: They were not friendly to us aft Œ they 
know Œ knew we were Jewish. They could Œ they 
could see me  go in front of a line to buy a loaf of
 bread, and they resented
 that. The adults, they 
didn™t say a word, but th-the kids
 resented that. Of course, th
ey probably didn™t understand why 
we had those privileges. But I-I di  Œ definitely saw resentment. 
Q: Mm-hm. Wat Œ was there any more overt an
ti-Semitism?  Any spitting, like you sa id before? 
A: Not that I notice it. Not that  I notice. I have 
notice anti-Semitism, especi
ally in Munich in the 
last five years.  

Q: We ™ll get to that. So you stayed, and you said
 Werner Nathan ma de arrangeme nts with the 
American Joint Distribution Œ Je
wish Distribution Committee. And 
so can you Œ let™s just talk 
about th-those arrangements. 

A: Okay. Werner Œ we again explained to We rner 
Œ fortunately he was fluent in German, as he 
came from Austria Œ that our father was an Americ
an citizen, died in Auschwitz and we want to 
come  Œ go t o America. And again he did, on 
his own, he contacted the Joint Distribution 
Committee in New York, and a-again, I don™t re
me mber how long it took, but I know in the 
meanti me  we went to Lüneburg where we went 
to a recuperation camp sp
onsored by the British 
military, who put us back into health. And it was an American soldier Œ in fact, I think it was that 

Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) that pi
cked us up from Lüneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was Œ 
again, that must have been in late August, b
ecause September seventh we left Bremerhaven on 

the SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and we
nt to New York. And besides Œ just recently I 
me t an old ma n in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sist er  ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who 

also brought Jewish immigrants
 to the U.S. And usually pe
ople don™t know anything about, 
never heard of a SS Marine Marli
n, and he knew right away, he said
 that that was his Œ the Œ his 
sister ship. So it™s quite a small world. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
61 
 
Q: What were your feelings about leaving Ge
rmany?  You said that you felt partly German. 
A: I felt more Œ I was German and I acted like a Ge rman during the war, living under false or 
assume d na me s. But the day we walked onto 
the ship, it was the greatest feeling you can 
imagine. And Œ 

Q: Did you bring anything special with you from Germany?  

A: No, we did not. We  didn™t want anything. Like 
when the Russians came  into Berlin we Œ my 
brother and I each pi cked up some very expe
nsive Leica cameras from photography stores. 

Everybody else took it, so we took some  of th
is belongings. They took our belongings, the 
German. But we did not want 
anything German. We did not br
ing anything back that was 
German. We  Œ on the ship, we ma de a few dollars
 on the ship. We ll, I di
d, my brother got too 
seasick. He was sick mo st of the way across. 
For some  reason I did not get seasick. And pe Œ 
other refugees that were on the sh
ip wanted to buy shaving cream or
 things that was in the Œ that  
you could purchase on the ship. And th
ey didn™t want to stay in line 
and so I used to stay in line 
for Œ for them and buy what they wanted. In fact 
here™s a Œ I still reme mb
er this one gentlema n 
wanted chewing gum. And I purchased and 
I took the German pronunciation for ch-chewing 
gum, which would be shaving gum, and instead of
 getting chewing gum for him, I ended up with 
a tube of shaving cream. I still reme mber that. A
nd I ended up Œ I have finally ended up selling it 
to some body else, because he wanted
 chewing gum, not shaving cream. 
Q: We re there Œ was it all refugees on the boat? 

A: I would say 99 percent were refugees, and again 
those were people either that were Œ survived 
at a concentration camp or lived in hi ding some place, some where so Œ some where. 

Q: And again, did you talk to each ot
her about what you had gone through?   

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
62 
 
A: No, I don™t believe Œ I didn™t 
want to, my brother didn™t want
 to and I don™t think anyone 
aboard wanted to talk about what they went thro
ugh. It™s Œ yes, they wanted to get that out of 
their mi nd.  
Q: And how long did the voyage take? 

A: It took 10 days. We  l e ft Sept
ember seventh, we arrived Œ when 
I saw the Statue of Liberty in 
New York, that was September 17
th
. Greatest sight you can see.  
Q: And wha t  was it like to put your foot down on American soil? 

A: Oh, it was great. Some thing th
at we thought we would never s
ee. And there were quite a few 
kids like us, orphan kids on that ship, again, also
 sponsored by the Joint Distribution Committee, 
most of them had no parents. And they were like
 we were, ma ybe some  of them thought they had 
a relative there, but again didn'
t know. And again, it was representatives from the Joint that 
picked us up and took us to 441 Caldwell Ave
nue, Brooklyn Œ I mean, Bronx, New York. And of 

course we were fed and treated wonderfully. A
nd the next day we were interviewed by German 
speaking people, and Œ 
Q: Wa - Was this a family that you went to on Œ in the Bronx? 

A: No, it was a Œ I really would say like an or
phan home . It was for children, and we were in 
there and they had beds, several beds in a room. 
And they, of course, separated the boys and the 

girls. 

Q: And then after your interview, what happened? 

A: And then, of course, we told them that we had two uncles some place in the U.S. And they 

said well, were they from Ger many?  And we said
 yes, they were origin
ally from Bre s lau, now 
ber Œ Poland. And they said, well there is a ne
wspaper that has a nationwide publication plus 
Canada. Of course, we didn™t know 
Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time . But they said 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
63 
 
they will put an ad in the ﬁAufbauﬂ and see if our
 uncles Œ at that time  we still thought they were 
uncles Œ if our uncles by any chan
ce were to read that newspaper, as most German spe a king Jews 
were subscribers to that newspa
per. Well, our uncles did not r
ead it, but very good friends of 
theirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad. And 
there were pages and pages and pages of kids or 
adults looking for people and most of them Œ it 
was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads, 
and these friends of my uncles, wh
ich turned out to be 
cousins, read that 
and called them. They 
were in Saint Louis, and my cousins Œ we™ll ca
ll them my true things, my cousins from my 
father™s si de, were called up and said there are 
two kids, just came  from Berlin and they are 
looking for Alfred and Felix tau Œ 
Taucher. And of course that™s when we  learned they were 
cousins. And my cousins were both brothers an
d they had just, actually not that long ago had 
come  to the U.S., because one cousin lived in 
Shanghai during the war, wh
ile the other one lived 
in South America. But apparently they had kept
 in touch all through the war and they ended up 
in Joplin, Missouri. How they ended up in J
oplin, I have no idea. But Joplin is a small 
community of about 35,000 people, and that™s wh
ere they ended up. And 
since they were in 
Joplin when we were found, but they were singl
e people, there was no woma n in the house, the 
social welfare agency, Je wish social fe Œ agency 
wouldn™t let us live there a
nd so we went to live 
with foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri. 
A family by the name  of Levinson, and he was a 

very Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and 
we lived with them for probably four or five 
months. But we had really problems living toge
ther, because we were not raised Orthodox. And 
so then we were moved into Œ in to another family. 

Q: Did you go to school th-then? 

A: Yes, we started th Œ both of us started in
 the eight grade. Now reme mber, my brother went 
through the third grade, I went the second grade 
of school in Germany. Even after the war, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
64 
 
short time  we went to the German school then
 wa s still only the s
econd grade, didn™t know 
English. But we went to school in Kansas City, Missouri for two years, and they assigned a 
teacher to us who knew a little bit of German, 
not  very much. She was Jewish, Mrs. We inberg, 
and she worked as Œ worked with us Œ tutored us
 to learn English. And what my brother and I did 
after we started school, we took a German Englis
h dictionary and just studied it page by page, 
word for word. And after awhile it got so that  
we used words that th
e English teachers didn™t 
understand, or we used it in the wrong context. 
And my brother then Œ this was in the ninth 
grade, I be lieve, I had a different English teacher
 than my brother di d and my English teacher, 
she says Œ a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fr ed, you ha
ve to buy some  comi c books and start reading 
comi c books. I don™t care what comi c books you read, but buy comi c books and you will have 

the Œ a much Œ ma ybe not the best gr amma r in 
the world, but you will get English that is being 
used every da y. And I will say it really helped. Re
ading the comi cs, I had a Œ seeing the pictur es 
and getting most of it out, I 
probably learned mor e  Englis
h from that than anything. 
Q: And wha t  about your name ?  You were then Œ by then Fred?  Wa s that your decision? 

A: Oh, ba Œ my Œ my cousin who we lived with th
en, after Kansas City when we moved to Joplin 
Œ oh, I should say that. We went to school in Kans
as City for two years, and then my Œ in the 
meanti me  my cousin brought in one of their aunts 
who was in Israel, at that time  I believe still 
known as Palestine. We ll, it was ™48 when Pale
stine was Œ became an independent state. And 
they brought her there to Joplin from Israel a
nd then we were permitted to live with them, and 
we went to the 10
th
, 11
th
 and 12
th
 grade in Joplin, Missouri. 
Q: And you s Œ and Œ and when did you change your name? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
65 
 
A: We  changed our name when we Œ we became 
citizen. Actually, I did not change my name 
from Horst Alfred until after I got out of the ar
my. Maybe we should go back to that later. I 
finished high school, my br
other finished high school. 
Q: Did the Œ did the Missouri children accept you
?  Did you feel like an outside in the high 
school?  

A: Not at all. We  Œ in fact, we were asked to speak at assemb lies about our Œ some  of our lives in 

Germany and Berlin during the war.And didn™t really want to talk 
about Œ we didn™t talk to a lot 
of the detail because we were ashame d to talk about
 it. For instance, I didn™t want to talk, in fact 

I didn™t tell anybody I was in a co
ncentration camp or in a trai
n, I was too ashame d of it, 
especially how I was caught. I mean, no 12 year 
old kid wants to talk about why they were 
caught. And we didn™t say that we we re in a conc
entration camp, but we just talked what it was 

life, the bombing and how it was life,
 living in fear, trying not to 
get caught. And that™s really 
most of the things that we talked about to othe
r kids. But we were very we ll accepted by the kids. 
We ma de a lot of friends. In fact, both my br
other and I go to reunion. 
In fact we have, in 
September, we have the 50
th
 year reunion comi ng up in Joplin, 
which I plan to attend and so does 
my brother. And we™ve ma de a lot of friends there. 

Q: Did you take part in sc
hool activities and sports?   
A: Very mu ch so. Not in sports so much, but
 I actually was in ROTC, Reserved Officer™s 

Training. And we had rifle teams, we had drill te
ams a Œ whi c h I participated. I also belonged to 
a Œ to various clubs, like the Key Club, which is
 the forerunners, I think to the Kiwanis, and I 

was very active. My brother was not too active, 
my brother Œ actually, my 
a Œ one of our cousins 
who we lived with was a pianist and he also taug
ht piano, and my brother 
always wanted to learn 
the piano. So while I was involved in a lot of school
 activity, my brother practiced and played the 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
66 
 
piano, but he , which I was not, got to really en
joy playing baseball, and learned Œ and became a 
very good baseball player. And he
 belonged to a baseball team, 
a high school baseball team and 
so forth. And that™s where his activity was, wh
ile mi ne was in drill teams and rifl e teams and 
Kiwanis clubs and so forth. In fact, I even learne
d how to be a speaker. And this is why I do a lot 
of speaking engageme nts now and it 
doesn™t bother me  to be Œ be speak in front of public, or 
even on TV, where I™ve taught many, many times .  
Q: Did you feel very Amer
ican at that point?  

A: Yes, I did. I felt Œ after I got pretty proficient
 in English, in fact when I went in the U.S. 
Ar my, five years after comi ng here, nobody believedme  that I was a Œ originally from Ger many, 

I spoke English like an American, rather than 
a foreigner. Through the years I started speaking 
German aga i n, also learned Japanese and I sp
eak both languages. And so

Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: Œ volunteer collection interview with Fred Tauc
her. This is tape number three, side B and you 
were talking about how you kept up Œ you were Œ 
you have an aptitude for languages. So then 
you graduated from high school, and what happened? 
A: Graduated from high school in 1951 and then 
I applied to go to the 
University of Missouri 
law school, since I had two uncles from my mother™s
 side that were lawyers. We  also had uncles 
that were dentists, mostly from our mother™s 
side. In fact, I know of
 one uncle who was in 
Shanghai during the war, and I me t some body in S
eattle who Œ whose dentist was my uncle in 
Shanghai. But anyhow Œ 

Q: You Œ bu-but you were Œ what about underg
raduate at college?  What do you mean you 
applied to law Œ you wa nted to apply to law school? 

A: I applied after I got 
out of high school, I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then 
eventually go into law school, right?  Well, 
when I took the entrance examination for the 
University of Missouri, apparently my score on th
e English part of the test was above average. 
And I was told that I cheated because  the resu
lts of the test score was muc h higher than it 
possibly could have been with the lack of educat
ion I have had and the short time  that I have 
been in the U.S. I did ask to take the test ov
er again, but back in 1951 that was not done. At Œ 
times have changed today. But so Œ since I could 
not go to the University
 of Missouri, I didn™t 
really know what I wanted to study then, because
 my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my 
parents wanted me  to be a lawyer, my brother to
 be a dentist. And so I was 18 and a half years 
old, or almo st. They were just starting to draft 18
 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the 
army and get that out of my Œ out of my life here. And so I joined the army. 

Q: And this was during the Korean war? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
68 
 
A: That was ko Œ during the Korean war. And af
ter I took my basic training in Fort Leonard 
Wood, Missouri, I was assigned to
 a replacement company there 
as a company clerk. And then 
one of the generals who was reassigned fr
om Fort Leonard Wood, who was reassigned to 
Germany, wanted a native speaking German to be hi
s driver in Germany. So I was picked to be 
the driver for this general, sinc
e I was a native speaking German. 
But I, at that time  I was not 
prepared to go back to Germany, a nd since I wa s 
still a citizen of the u 
Œ of Ger many, I did not 
have to go. 

Q: All right, you were not a ci
tizen yet of the United States? 
A: I was still a non-citizen. Now, 
I did take Œ this was kind of odd Œ I did take the examination 
for citizenship in Rolla, Missouri,
 a small city near Fort Leonard Wood. I n fact this was a college 
town, I think it was a Œ still is a very well known 
engineering school. And this is where, in that 
city, I took my exa m for  citizen
ship. In fact, one of the quest
ions that I was asked by the 
examiner Œ and I was in U.S. Ar my uniform, I 
was a corporal at the tim
e Œ and this examiner, 
one of the questions asked, if I were called to se
rve in the U.S. military in time of war, would I 
do that?  And I looked at him, I said, well– And he sa
ys yes, I Œ I™m sorry that I have to ask that, 
but that Œ that is the rule, and I realize you ar
e in the military. It k-ki nd of struck me odd. And 
anyhow, I took my citizenship examination, which 
I passed. Of course, it was everythi ng I had 
learned in high school, in governme nt and so forth. 
Was a Œ to me Œ for me it was a very simple 

exam. And it was really about Œ s
hortly wi Œ thereafter, when I ha
d the orders to go to Germany, 
but then I looked up the Jewish chaplain in Fort
h Leonard Wood, and I told him a little bit of my 
story, and of course he got my a Œ says no, I don™t have to go and they canceled my order to 

Germany. But abou Œ 

Q: Why did you not want to go to Germany?  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
69 
 
A: I-I st ill ha d too ma ny bad me mories in Germany. And the feeling there, I just was not 
prepared. And I also Œ besides that
, I didn™t want to be 
a driver for a general. I wanted to learn 
some thing while I was in the military rather than
 drive a car around and be what I considered a 
nursemaid. And so my orders thre
e days later were for Korea. A
nd I had a two weeks leave, went 
back to Joplin, visited my friends and said 
the goodbyes and everything. 
And I went to Fort 
Lewis, Wa shington, which is about a fr Œ one hour 
drive out of Seattle. And I kind of fell in love 
with that part of the country and I said to myself
, if I ma ke it back alive from Korea, this is going 
to be home. And I went to Korea and that was 1952. 

Q: How did you feel putting on an American army uniform?  

A: Proud. I was very proud to be wearing the army 
unifor m. And I think this is why I ma de, even 
through the enlisted rating, I ma de rank much fast
er than ma  Œ the average American citizen 
counterpart. While these people complained about 
the military and they didn™t want  to work, I 

did my duty and I was proud of it. And I believe 
this is why in Korea, even though there were 
sergeants that were 15 years in
 the army, I passed them up a nd 
received the rank of warrant 
officer appointme nt, when others way ahead of 
me  should have received it. It was probably a 
responsibility I had at my age that I shouldn™t ha
ve had. I was only 20 years old when I became  a 
warrant officer. 21 years old, I guess. But I alwa
ys felt proud to be an American soldier. 
Q: What were your duties in Korea? 

A: In Korea I Œ my fir Œ my first duties were to 
code reports that came from the front lines, and 
pick out the soldiers that we
re killed in action, wounded in 
action, mi ssing, and I also had the 
locator; an assignment I wasn™t supposed to have 
had as I was not a U.S. citizen, but I had that 
assignment. And then I got Œ those papers I got re
ady to be put into, which now are computers, in 
those time s they were ma chine accounting, we
 programme d t hem with Œ through plugboard 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
70 
 
wires and punch cards. And the ma n that was real
ly in charge and doing the actual operating of 
the equipment was a warrant officer. Well, he was killed driving over a mi ne and Œ which I 

didn™t know, but he Œ he was late
 in bringing the repor
ts in, which I had to code, for him to 
process through. But instead of him comi ng in, th
e Œ a colonel came in and stuck a couple of 
warrant officers™ bars on my shoulder, tore off 
my sergeant stripes and sa
ys, you have just been 
appointed to a warrant  officer, you are going to be
 Œ replace Mr. Eberhart(ph) Œ a warrant officer 
is addressed as mi ster Œ who was killed in ac
tion, and we will have a replacement for you 
shortly. After my replaceme nt ca me  in, they assign
ed another warrant officer
 to that unit and sent 
me  to Japan for three weeks, where I learne d 
how to operate those m
achines. And after three 
weeks I went back to Korea and continued the duties as a warrant officer. 

Q: Did you ever Œ when you were in 
Korea, did you ever see any bodies? 

A: I see Œ saw a lot of bodies. 

Q: And did that remi nd you of your experience du
ring the war, being in 
the railroad car and 
during the bombing of 
Berlin, seeing bodies? 
A: No, it did not. It did not remi nd me at all. I 
s Œ was sad, seeing American soldiers dead, but it 
di Œ it was not even close to remi nding me  what it wa
s like in the railroad car, because first of all, 
in the railroad car it was dark and you Œ 
most of the time you couldn™t see the bodies, you 
couldn™t see the faces. And even if you could, yo
u didn™t want  to. And you just saw pe ople that 
were dead and I never related th
at. I felt sorrow for the poor Americ
an soldiers that were killed. 
And again, it™s just like I felt 
that way ever since a child in 
Œ during my life in Germa ny, that 
when my time is up I™m going to go, a
nd if not, I™ll keep on going and living. 
Q: And how long did you stay in Korea? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
71 
 
A: Until the very tail end of the war, which I believe was September or October of ™53, I™m not 
quite sure. And after Korea I wa
s transferred to Tokyo, where I wa
s stationed for nine months. 
And actually Œ well, not at the time, I Œ I took up 
the ma rtial arts over ther
e, I took both judo and 
karate. And my instructor introduced me  to his 
sister, who was Japanese, of course. And Œ and I 
fell in love and applied to get ma rried. But as an 
officer Œ at that time  an
 officer could not ma rry 
outside the race unless you go back to an enlisted 
rating. So I was due to be  discharged then, so I 
went back to the States, took my discharge and th
en went back to Japan to get ma rried. We  were 
ma rried in excess of 40 years but we ar
e divorced now, but we™re still friends. 

Q: So you got ma rried in Japan and then
 brought your bride to the United States? 

A: Yes, I did. Yes, I was ma rried by the Ameri
can consul in Tokyo. And Œ oh, one thing I should 

me ntion. While I was heading to Korea, the army
 sent my i mmi gration records and citizenship 
records Œ that™s to be a citi
zen, to Germany, wher e my assignment was supposed to Œ where the 
first orders for it Œ for Germany. By the time 
everything got caught up I wa s going back to the 
States to be discharged. So I 
Œ when I got Œ before I got discharged again, being a warrant 
offi cer, an offi cer had to be a citizen before they can get di scharged fr om the military. So I had to 

take a 10 day leave of absence, which I wanted 
to get paid for and the army arranged a special 
citizenship exam for me in Rolla, Missouri, wher
e all my records were st ill, where I was taki ng 
my Œ took my examination. And they had a special 
hearing for me  to sworn in as a citizen. Then 
I had to go back Œ I was at that time  stationed at
 Fort Carlson, Colorado, and I had to go back to 
Fort Carlson, get my discharge. 

Q: And to be a udis Œ U.S. citizen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
72 
 
A: And then to be a u Œ a U.S. citizen, the greate
st feeling that could ha 
Œ happen to Œ could have 
happened to me . And again, I was proud that I co
uld serve in the U.S. Ar my, and even more 
proud then, to be a citizen. 
Q: And then you came Œ and then you came back and Œ when you got discharged, and went to 

school?  

A: No, I did not. I did not go to school. My Œthen my goal was to go back to Japan to get 

married. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I got a job Œ at that time, U.S. military 
people stoo Œ air force, navy, I Œ I should say air 
force, Marines and army were still going overseas 
to Korea, even though it was after the war, to 
Korea or Japa n on ships. And I took a job a Œ on the military sea transportation se rvice, that™s a 

civilian group. We  were taking troops overseas an
d bringing them back. And I took a job on one 
of those ships and got good pay and went back to
 Japan to get ma rried. And came  back after my 
ma rriage and took a job in Œ again 
I™ll call it computers, 
in the Œ doing the same  thing except Œ e-
except I wasn™t te Œ keeping track of casualtie
s, my first job was working for an insurance 
company where I operated
 the machine accounting. 
Q: Now, did you go back to Missouri or did you go to Seattle? 

A: I went to Seattle. I went b
ack to Missouri, visit my cousins 
and took some  of the belongings I 
had there and went back to Seattle. 

Q: And you™re with your young bride? 

A: No, no, she came Œ she didn't come o-over until a
bout six or seven months later. Since I was a 
naturalized citizen, and a new natu
ralized citizen, it took me  quite some  time  to get a passport for 
her. And since I was in Seattle, Wa shington, a
ll my Œ again, my immi gration and naturalization 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
73 
 
paper were in Missouri, I had to apply for he
r visa through Missouri, and it was a Œ quite a 
lengthy operation. 
Q: And then she came and what Œ then what happened? 

A: Okay, she came over here and about a year late
r we had our first son. And six years later we 
had a daughter. 

Q: And your w-work career? 

A: I worked then Œ at that time I worked fo
r a trucking comp any, again in machine accounting, 
and in 1960 I set up a com Œ this is when the first part of the computers came  around 

[indecipherable] programming com
puters, and I took the second pr
ogramming course in Seattle, 
back in 1959, learning how to program those new,
 beautiful computers, IBM computers, which 
were then the 1401. And took a job with a divisi
on of Boise Cascade Corporation, and I set up 
the very first computer installation for Greyst
one Concrete Products. Like I say, that was a 
division from Boise Cascade, it was Œ they ma de
 concrete blocks and pipe, ceme nt products. And 
I se Œ they had 11 different locations and I set 
up the computer departme nt in all 11 locations, 
and then became , besides being the Œ what was 
called the data processing ma nager, I also was 
ma de the assistant controller.
 And I put in ma ny, ma ny hours and in 1963, a Œ this Greystone 
division, some  of the managers 
bought the division from Boise Ca
scade, and I was supposed to 
have been included as one of th
e owners but they cut me  out, st
rictly the controller of that 
company, who was als Œ see Œ embezzling from th
e company. And of course, being the Œ in the 

accounting departme nt, which was part of the da
ta processing, I knew what was going on. And 
he cut me  out as being a owner of the comp
any. So in 1963, I resi gned my position and started 
my own bus iness, and Œ which is Œ I still have
 that business. Today, my company, the second 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
74 
 
oldest privately owned computer company in Seat
tle. I have pretty much turned the business 
over to my son. I am still active in the financial area of the company.  
Q: Speaking of your son and your daughter, when 
you were raising them, did you tell them about 
what you went through? 

A: Ver Œ not too much. My son was never too much
 interested in it. My daughter was very much 
interested. And when my  daughter we nt to th
e University of Washington, she decided she 
wanted to join a sorority. And I never pushed it 
or anything, she decided she wanted to join the 
AEPhi, which was a Jewish sorority. And she has 
taken a lot more interest  in what we went 
through, and even now she is very much intereste
d. I think she belongs to some  kind of a Jewish 
friendship club here in Washingt
on, D.C., where she is living. 
Q: Did you r-raise your children Jewishly? 

A: No, I did not, as a Œ neither m Œ none of my
 family were that Jewish and we Œ well, I do 

consider myself Jewish, but I am not a religious
 person. And of course my wife, being Japanese 
was not Jewish and is also not religious, that
 we let our kids do th
eir own. And my da ughter 
leans very much towards the Jewish 
religion, rather than anything else. 
Q: Are your children bilingual? 

A: My son is not. He never picked up the 
other language, even though at home  we spoke 
Japanese. My son can understand Japanese, not
 everything. He can understand his mother, but 
other Japa nese he can™t really underst and. But 
my daughter is very much bilingual. In high 
school she studied German and could communicate 
very well in German. And in Japanese, her 
Japanese now is much better than my Japanese
. She Œ most of her clients Œ she works as a 
consultant for a company and all of her clients, 
not most Œ most of her c Œ yes, mos t  of her 
clients are Japanese. She does have
 one client in London and I thi
nk she has two different clients 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
75 
 
in Spain, where she has visited. But most of her c
lients are in Japan, and of course, she speaks it. 
And the strange thing is, to Japanese, my da
ughter does not look Japanese, she looks more 
American, more Caucasian. And when she speaks
 Japanese to the Japanese, they are just 
flabbergasted because she does not speak like a 
foreign, like an American Japanese, she speaks 
like a native Japanese.  
Q: Are there any sights or sounds today, or sme
lls that remi nd you of your wartime experience, 
that kind of triggers a me mory?  

A: We ll, a good experience is in Seattle just  ab
out three weeks ago. Again, like I say, I™m still in 
the computer business today. One 
of the things we do is we host websites. The Œ we have a 
election comi ng up very shortly in
 Seattle, one of them is fo
r ma yor. A ma n that™s running for 
ma yor is presently the city attorney, who happens
 to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website. 
And his website is Sidran for Seattle ma yor dot
 org, dot com, we™ve used all of them. Well 
some body who doesn™t like him put up another we
bsite and called it Mark Sidran dot com, 
which is this Œ this attorney w
ho is running for, his first name . We
ll, his we bsite is only Sidran 

for Seattle ma yor because Mark Sidran was 
already taken. Well, that we bsite has a huge 
swastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a Œ a 
Nazi, as an SS. And it™s some body that is upset 
with him. And that Œ seeing that swastika bother
s me  more now than it did when I saw it every 
day and lived with it in Germany 
during the regime . Another time Œ 
and I refuse to go back to 
Munich, Germany Œ I Œ a  few years ago I had a clie
nt in Munich and we were doing big business, 
really, with each other. And fina
lly Œ and we always talked over the phone, always in English. 

This was, of course, back quite some  time, befo
re email really, where we sent faxes. We sent 

faxes back and forth, always in English. And 
in 1979 I visited him in person. And we had a 
appointment at 15 mi nutes before 12 at his pl ace.
 I got there at 15 mi nutes before 12, told his 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
76 
 
receptionist who I was, and she sa
id yes, I™ll let Mr. Œ I forgot 
his name  now Œ I™ll let him know. 
And so I waited, and then I asked the receptioni
st, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I 
spoke no German at the time . And as k him well, 
does he have some body with him, is he busy?  
She says no, but he must be busy, but he™ll be 
out. And at exactly 12 o™clock Œ and at exactly 12 
o™clock he come s out and he star
ts speaking German to me . Herr Taucher, and used the German 
pronunciation and didn™t say I™m sorr
y or anything. And I spoke in English. And he didn™t even 
know I spoke engli Œ German. We  never before
 spoke German, it was strictly a business 
relationship in English. He spoke very good 
English when we talked over the phone. His 
communication in English and on faxes was excell ent. And I said, don™t you s-speak English?  
You know, we™ve been communicating Œ yes, bu Œ 
and in German he answers, but you are in 

Germany, you have to speak Germa n. So I finall
y said, okay, I™ll play your silly game . In 
German. Of course, thatstartled hi
m.  And the next thing he says, 
oh it™s 12 o™clock, I have to go 
lunch. We ll, thanks for stopping in. I said goodbye,
 and I have never communicated with this 
guy. And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 
dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business. 
And we gave it to some body else. And I have found ot
her times in Munich, that is the mentality I 
find in Munich. Anyplace else, and that include
s eastern Germany, I have not found that. The 
people say in eastern Germany you have a lot of
 anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found 
that myself in eastern Germany. In Munich, yes, 
I can see kids even, 17 Œ 18 year old kids giving 
the Hitler youth Œ I-I me an, the Hitler salute. That
 is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east 
Germany that™s not permitted and they get arrest ed. In Munich the police turns ar ound. And I see 

the Nazi mentality all over 
again in Munich, and I refuse to go back to Munich. 
Q: What does that do to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
77 
 
A: It Œ it hurts me , it bothers me . And again, if
 I were younger, I would probably get myself in 
trouble. But I Œ I will say my training in j
udo and karate does teachyou discipline, and you don™t 
start a fight. But I-I am afraid in my younger days, 
I could have lost myself. It does bother me.  
Q: Do you think about your experien Œ your 
wartime experiences now often, more oft e n? 
A: Yeah. I do. What Œ when I really we Œ in fact , that™s the first time  in many, ma ny years that I 

have nightma res is when I took Patricia, who you me t,
 with me  to Berlin last year, and I took her 

to the SS headquarters, the old SS Œ SS headquarter
s. In fact, that was 
Himmler™s headquarters, 
where they also had the torture chamber. And th
ey had some  records of me, and I was asked to 
give a taped interview there. A
nd the first thing, of course I as
ked, why do you want it for?  What 
do you want it?  And this gentlema n 
who I talked to, he was in his mi ddle 30™s, I™d say, he says, 
well there™s so much denial going 
on in Germany that we want to 
get interviews fr om people that 
have been here, whether they were Jewish or not
 Jewish. There were a number of Germans that 
were also arrested and tortured there, and we™d 
like to interview every on
e of them, a nd then we 
are s-spreading those tapes th
rough high schools throughout Germany. 
So, of course I agreed to 
that interview and I had probably a 45 mi nute inte
rview there, all in German, so that high school 
kids can fully understand it.  

Q: I wanted to ask you before about that expe
rience. How is it that you did not release any 
information when they were questioning you?  You were so young. 

A: I think it™s Œ I first knew th
at if I released information, my  
mother and my brother would also 
be caught. I knew that first of a
ll. Second, every time when I was r
eady to talk, they tortured me  
so much that I passed out. And when I came to
 again, again I passed out
. I me an, there were 
times, I™ve told you some of them, like pulling te
eth, filling teeth without any me dication. Other 
times I reme mber they had me jump in a bath
tub full of ice cubes, 
full of ice, and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
78 
 
imme diately go out in very hot water, and Œ which, I passed out. And it Œ things like that. Some  
of it I Œ I don™t even want to talk
 about it, it™s just Œ but when I 
did visit that place with Patricia, 
they ma ke Œ ma de a me morial out of it now, ma
ybe you™re aware of that, I had nightmares for 
the next two or three nights in
 the hotel. Yea
h, they really brought b
ack the me mories like it 
happened. 

Q: Are there any smells that Œ that stimula
te me m Œ are any smells that stimulate you? 
A: Occasiona lly so-some things ma ybe Œ you sme
ll something, maybe there was a dead animal 

around in a real hot climate. Yes,
 that Œ that does remi nd me , but 
I try to wipe it out of my mi nd. 
But yes, occasionally that has remi nded me , mos
tly of the train. And ev
en Œ I™ll say it, even 
smelling dog feces, that remi nds me of the train.

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Fred Taucher. This is tape numbe
r four, side A, and we were talking about sounds 
and sights that Œ that trigger me mory for you.Anything else that you 
wanted to include? 
A: No, that™s really Œ I believe again the smell some
ti mes of dead animal or what I said earlier is 

probably the only thing that Œ or 
when I see a swastika. Yeah, wh
en I see a swastika, it™s Œ it 
immediately remi nds me  Œ it remi nds me of Pr
inz-Albrecht-Strasse neun, 
or nine, the torture 
chamber, what I call. It does remi nd me . And anot
her thing is, like I said, it does remi nd me  right 
here at the Holocaust Museum, when I am in front
 of that train, I cannot 
step foot. I™ve been 
remi nded of this when I visited Yad Vashem in 
J erusalem, and they have
 that train up there on 
the stand. And that train that they
 have there looks just identical 
to the train that I was in. And I 
did have some  night ma re that night at the hotel 
in Jerusalem.  The rest of it, I can go Œ another 
thing I cannot do, I have actually vi
sited the camp in Dachau once, 
and really I didn™t have too 
ma ny problems visiting it. It did give me  an idea 
had I been out of the train what I Œ what it 
would have been like. And I was ab
le to visit that. When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child 
Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, 
they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to 
Auschwitz. I could not go there. I decided not to 
go, because I lost a lot of my fa mily in both of 
those places. Was some first in Theresienstadt 
and then in Auschwitz. And I decide d there™s no 
way I could go inside Auschwitz. So
 I chose not to take that tour
. And th Œ I think in Prague, 
being in Prague and going through the Jewish ceme
tery there, even though I had no relatives in 
Prague, but it sure br
ought back me mories. 
Q: When you ju Œ got off of the train car 
in Dachau, did you see a
ny part of the camp? 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
80 
 
A: We ll, I jo Œ only Œ I™m sorry 
Œ I only see the front, with a gate
 there, fr eiheit Œ Arbeit macht 
freiheit. I did see some  people walking, mostly N
azis. I do reme mber seeing two or three people 
walking, I saw dead people. And of course so
me  of them couldn™t Œ no, I don™t think the camp 
was really bo mbed. I think the Œ the allies and 
both Œ the Russians did not bomb the camp. And 
of course at that time they flew very low. I m
ean, there were so me times when I was still in the 
train I thought the airplanes were going to landon top of the train. I mean, you could hear how 
close they were. And Œ but I saw Œ I can reme mb er
 there were soldiers and I saw a few striped 

jackets, which were prisoners, but
 that™s about all I remem Œ reme
mber of inside the camp. And I 
think there were only a few privile
ged prisoners, I think, that could 
be close to the gate for some  
reason or another. But other than that I do not 
reme mber. But like I say again, I jump ed off the 
train and then imme diately followed all those 
Russian soldiers which was crossing the train 
going the other direction.  

Q: Would you be a different person today, do you th
ink, if you hadn™t hadthe childhood that you 
did?  

A: I don™t think so. I thin
k I probably wouldn™t be as active in
 non-profit organizations that I am. 
But I don™t think so. In fact, this
 bother me  now, I hear kids in trouble, kids taking dope and so 
forth, drugs. And I feel the me dia is excusing th
e kids because they have come from broken 
home s or bad parents and so forth. 
I think it™s still the child that
 wants it that way. I just cannot 
put all the blames on the parents.
 I think Œ I think the news me
dia helps ma ke the kids blame 
their parents. And they don™t have to do what 
they are doing. I interviewed one time a for mer 
service ma n for a job, and he star
ted talking that he took dope wh
en he was in Vietnam, but you 
know how it is like in wartime?  And I just had 
to take, and everybody else took dope. And I said 
listen, I™ve gone through a war too, in Korea, a
nd not in Vietnam, but als Œ also si Œ was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
81 
 
prisoner in a concentration camp, and I never drea
me d of taking dope. That™s not an excuse and I 
Œ I can™t use you here in my company. And I didn™
t spend any more time. It a Œ I just wouldn™t 
buy it. Yes, there are some  kids that were abused 
by their parents or so Œ gran Œ or foster parents 
or what have  you, but still some  of it, it™s up to 
the ki-kid. And I don™t think I became a criminal. 
And Œ and people have asked me , we ll how come
 you have made some thing of yourself?  And 
why do other kids get in trouble?  I have no answer
 for it, but I do know that they don™t have to 
be it. 

Q: Do you seek out other survivors as frie
nds and do you Œ if you meet one, do you feel a 
connection?  

A: Yes, I definitely do. Yes, I do. I know what
 they™ve gone through and they know what I™ve 
gone through, yes. But a lot of survivors, agai
n, they hold a Œ I don™t kn
ow if it™s a grudge, but 
they don™t want to forget it, they want to li
ve with the past. And I say hey, you don™t want to 
forget it, but don™t live with the past. Live w
ith what it is now. A good example is we talked 
about Œ earlier about Lüne burg, and this recu
pe ration camp put on by the British. There is one 
lady, Dodie Jacobson, I believe her Œ is her name . 
She fo-found me  in Prague, when we were in 
Prague and we were at a workshop where we ta
lked about our experiences during the war. And 
nobody wanted to speak up, and so I was the first to
 speak, and I was telling my story in Berlin, 
and my brother and I survived, etcetera. And all 
of a sudden this one lady, Dodie, interrupted, 

and she says, were you in Lüneburg? And I said ye
s, my brother and I were there. And she went 
hysterical, because she is one that was in 
Lüneburg with us. And she was never in a 

concentration camp, but lived in
 horrible condition in hiding. 
And today she has never gotten 
ma rried, doesn™t want to, can™t get along with 
people. And again, she said it right at this 
workshop, she Œ there is Œ she Œ it™s still from 
her time in Germany. She doesn™t really want to 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
82 
 
ma ke good friends with anybody very long. And agai
n I say, Dodie, these are different times. 
You gotta live with what™s now. But she doesn™t 
want to do it. And too many of the survivors 
live that way, which I think is wrong. 
Q: Some  say that they feel like
 two different people, one on the 
outside to the outside world, and 
a different person on the inside. 
Do you feel like that too?  

A: Yeah, I do not feel that way, but I do Œ ma ny of
 them that do feel that way, and I feel it™s 
wrong. You have to Œ for instance, I do nothold any prejudice towards the younger generation 

German, exc e pt the ones that Œ t
hose neo-Nazis. And s Œ but of c
ourse, we have them right here 
in the U.S. But the younger generation, the Œ 
the people 50 years old, 
even 60 years old and 
younger, I really don™t have any grudge against 
them. They c ouldn™t do anything about it, they 
were too young then. Most of them knew what
 was going on, but they didn™t know how bad it 
was and they couldn™t do anythi
ng. The people older than me, 72 y
ears old, let™s say, and older, 
they could have done some thing about it. And those 
I just Œ I can™t be friends with them. I have a 
tough time talking to them. But you have to get 
over it. You don™t have to be friends, but you 
can™t just hold a grudge against the y
ounger generation that couldn™t help it. 
Q: When you walk down the streets in Germany, I guess excluding Munich, do you feel 
comfortable? 

A: Yes, I do. In fact, I can tell you another ex
ample that really surp
rised me. Two years ago 
when I was in Berlin, and as a Œ at the invitation 
of Berlin; they paid for my trip, they put me  up 
at the Crown Plaza Hotel, that™s a block off the Kurfürstenda mm, one of the ma in thing of it, like 

Time s Square. And wh-while we were having dinner there wa s a big party going on in the ma in 

ballroom. And I™m a curious kind of a person and 
I looked in, and I see a 
lot of people with a 
yarmulke on. So I kind of walked in and I aske
d some body t here, he was about 19 years old, with 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
83 
 
a yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I sa
id, what™s going on here?  He
 said, this is a Bar 
Mitzvah. Do you know what a Bar Mitzvah is?  I said ye
s, and I told him that 
I lived in Berlin all 
through the war. I didn™t tell him I was in a co
ncentration camp, I said 
I am an American now, 
but I am Jewish. And I asked him, how does it f
eel for a Jewi sh person like you, especially your 
age, living here in Berlin?  And he
 looked at me  kind of strange, he says, I am a Ger man, he said. 
I am a Ger man, I am a Œ Jewish is my religion. 
And that™s how some  of t he Jewish community 
thinks today as a Œ that generation, the 
19 years and younger genera
tion. They consider 
themselves German and Jewish. Of course, Jewi
sh is a religion and j Œ they should consider 
themselves as such. But that they just  come
 right out and say, I™m 
Ger man , Jewish is my 
religion. It really Œ it almost shocked me . 
Q: What were your thoughts 
during the Eichma nn trial? 
A: What my  thoughts were, hang him. Just don™
t waste the time . Everybody know Œ the world 
knows he was as guilty as could be. And some tim
es Œ I don™t believe in capital punishme nt, I 
guess, but Ei chma nn or any of those, definitely. 
Don™t waste the time and money to keep them 
alive. That™s how I felt. 

Q: What are your attitude s towards food? 

A: To Œ towards food? 

Q: Towards food. You Œ you went th
rough times of terrible hunger. 
A: Right. 

Q: Did it affect your
 attitude today? 

A: It affects my attitude  towards food. First of al
l I™ve said to myself a 
long time ago, that was all 
the lack of food I™ve had and where I™ve had to ea
t practically dirt, I ate 
food that we didn™t know 
was poisonous or not, like plants, I have said 
I™m only going to eat food th
at I like. I™m not going 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
84 
 
to do Œ eat food that I don™t like . For instance, I never could get 
used to Oriental food, whether 
it™s Chinese, Japanese, or what. Even though I wa
s ma rried to a Japanese for over 40 years, I 
refused to eat Japanese food. I have customer
s in Japan, I do go to Japan. Every one of my 
customers know that I will not eat Japanese food a
nd they take  me  to western foods. I™m a very 
fussy eater and I just refuse to
 eat food that doesn™t agree with me  or I don™t like. That™s my 
attitude on food. 

Q: Do you feel very safe here? 

A: Yes, I do. I do. I don™t care what area I am in, I 
do feel safe . I just Œ I™ve never had a problem. 
Yes, in my younger days I did need judo once wh
en some body tried to rob me , and I was able to 
defend myself, keep my property. I did break this
 Œ I was going to say gentlema n, he was not a 
gentlema n Œ break his arm. And afterwards the po
lice Œ tha-that was in 
Chicago and one of the 
detectives from the Cook County police departmentcalled me  in Seattle and asked me how much 

I weighed, how tall I was. And I could almost se
e a smile through this detective™s face over the 
phone. What happened, the guy that 
tried to rob me  was 180 pounds a
nd six foot tall, and I broke 
his arm, and his lawyer said I used unnecessary
 roughness. But I was a little younger at that time , 
too. But I do feel safe, but part of
 it is probably due to my training. 
Q: We  talked about this before
, and ma ybe just to revisit it ag
ain, talking about whether or not 
you were angry that people your age in the United
 Sta Œ Jews in Œ your age in the United States 
were safe, and yet your life was in danger and yo
u had these terrible losses. Does that anger you 
today?  

A: No, it does not. I have absolutely no anger towa
rds that. What does anger me  a little bit, and 
that is for instance, the ship the Saint Louis that  
was turned back to their death, so to speak. Even 
the German skipper want ed to go someplace where he coul d Œ he could free the people, and that 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
85 
 
the U.S. did not admit them, that angers me . And 
again, while a lot of people, especially Jewish 
people Œ I know my cousins thought 
the world of Franklin Roosevelt.
 We l l , I still blame him. He 
could have st opped all of that. He coul d have saved millions of Jews. And so I™m angry towards 
that. But other than that, no, I am not angry. Bu
t I™m angry, again, for anyone that could have 
been saved by the U.S., and di Œ wasn™t. In fact, 
my brother Œ my brother,
 my  fa t h e r , my  fa mi l y  
should have been permitted to come  to the U.
S., without money. And again, I do not know, I was 
too young, I don™t know if my father 
ever contacted the American consulate in Berlin, I do not 
know. But I think even if he ha
d, I don™t think he could have 
gotten out, he didn™t have the 
money. And that does anger me .  

Q: When your children were the ages that
 you we re from let™s say six to 12, you know Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ during those difficult time s, 
did that ma ke you think even more of the Œ of your experiences, 
when they were going through the same  age di Œ that you were? 
A: I don™t know if I can say that
, I don™t think so. I, of course
 reme mber what has happened, I 
think about it. I think about it right here in this
 building and of course 
this interview here. But 
other than that I try not to thi
nk about it. Of course I™m talking 
about it more than I used to. I 
have spoken to Rotaries, and like I say, I™ve spoken 
to the mi litary. And it™s
 much easier to talk 
about it now than it used to be. 
Q: Wh- Why is that? 

A: Maybe time and age. And I have gotten used to 
talking about it and feel 
it is necessary that 
the world st ill knows. I ha ve found too ma ny young pe
ople, educated people that know so little 
of what has happened. In fact, some  of these peop
le even believe what they read on the internet, 
that it didn™t happen. And that™s 
when I started to talk about it more, and that™s why it™s a lot 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
86 
 
easier to talk about it now. Even today as we we
re talking there were so
me  ti me s, I don™t know if 
you noticed, I was getting choked up a 
little bit. And that I can™t hel
p. But at one time I just could 
hardly talk, th Œ I had to take 
a break and couldn™t talk about it. 
But now it™s Œ it™s not like that 
any more. 
Q: Did your experience affect how you 
and your wife raised your children? 
A: No, I don™t think so. I don™t think so. My wife
 Œ my ex-wife was very
 good in raising the 
children, and part of it is
 the Japanese culture too. And I™m 
ve ry proud of both of my kids. And I 
have to give her the credit for it because I wa
s starting a business and sp
ent not enough time with 
the kids. And that™s probably part of the fault why we ended up in a divorce that should have 

been much longer ago than it has. But I will Œ I de
finitely will give her 
the credit that our kids 
were raised properly and never have gotten into 
trouble. And of course I™m very proud of both of 
my kids. 

Q: Do you feel a connection to Germany?  Do you Œ do you feel German? 
A: Not at all, I am an American, and I feel a ve
ry loyal Ame r ican. If I were to be asked by the 
U.S. Army, or any U.S. military force, to serv
e in the military again due to some emergency, I 
would not say no. I would be ready to do it and 
I know my br other would go do the same  thing. 
I-I definitely feel my allegiance is to the U.S. a
nd not to Germany. And of course, I also feel very 
strongly about Israel, but I™m still an 
American more than an Israelite. 
Q: What Œ what are yo
ur thoughts about Israel? 
A: What my  thoughts is, I hope some day there will 
be peace there. I feel ve ry good that finally 
there is a country that Jews can live there, and ho
pefully again someti me in peace. I vi sited Israel 
for my first time  in 1998, when Israel was celebra
ting their 50 year inde
pendence. I represented 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
87 
 
the ma yor of Seattle. And I was Œ it was quite an 
experience to be in Isra
el. I enjoyed visiting it 
and I do hope to visit Israel again. I feel it is 
part of me, but still, my country is the U.S.A. 
Q: Were you active in the Civil Rights move me nt, 
or Œ ve Œ well, because you lived in a country 
where people™s civil rights were denied? 
A: No, I was never active in the Civil Rights.
 Again, I was too young, and of course Œ well, I 
don™t know if you ever heard of The White Rose? 

Q: Yes [inaudible] 

A: Then you know I mean. These were Germans, and 
they were all executed. 
In fact, I think they 
were first tortured at the same
 place I was at, and then hung at 
Plötzensee, which was the place 
where the Œ where the gallows were where they
 hung the Germans that didn™t go along with the 
regime  or helped Jews or so forth. 

Q: A-And what is the connection? We were talki
ng about your activity in 
the Civil Rights mov Œ  
A: We ll, I was not Œ I was not active. I was just
 saying the people that 
were active did not live 
very long. 

Q: No, no, no, I Œ that™s not what I meant. I mean
t, were you active in the Civil Rights move me nt 
in the United States, because you had lived in a c
ountry that deprived othe
rs of civil rights. Did 
you Œ was this some thing that you™v
e worked towards as an adult? 
A: As an adult, no, I was not active. I think Œ 
I think you™re going back to the 1960™s and 70™s. 
First of all, in Seattle, we did not have the prob
lems  there that you have ha
d in other parts of the 
country. For instance, we™ve had Afro-Ame rican ma yor
s in s Œ in Œ in Seattle. Exec Œ the present 
county executive is a Œ is a black ma n. And lately
 here we™ve had a few more problems, but that 
is because we get these activists comi ng in, not even from Seattle, that demonstrat e on Œ any 

time there™s some thing going on, starting when we
 had that WTO there. And these are people 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
88 
 
that were Œ are actually being pa
id to demonstrate. And Œ but late
ly we ni Œ didna Œ we have not 
had good leadership in Seattle. The ma yor, 
even though Œ the present ma yor, even though I 
supported him, Paul Schell, is not
 very strong. The previous police 
chief, the present police chief 
is not very strong. And if anything I am an ac
tivist now to get those people out. And again I™m 
very much up within the city coun
cilor, like I said earlier, I™m sort
 of on the sister city council of 
Seattle and I know most of the politicians. 
Q: So you are active in the political life of your city? 

A: In the political life,
 yes, I am very active in the political life. 
Q: Why is that?   

A: We ll, probably it goes back because about 30 
years ago the for mer governor of the state of 
Washington, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good 
friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my 
C.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks It
alian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven 
languages. And the former governor is an America
n, but he is from Italia
n parents. In fact, a 
book has been written on him. A
nd my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph)
 introduced me  to Governor 
Rosellini, and they have been long, long friends, 
and they always speak Italian together. And 
over the year s Governor Rosellini and I have beco
me  very close fr iends. And he is the ma n Œ 
again probably because I am in the computer 
business and I di d mailings for candidates and so 
forth. 

Q: So it™s not because  you were aware of what can happen when a political system goes awry? 

A: No, definitely not, it is just 
that I helped in the political  pa
rty and some  of the m Œ right now 
yes, I™m very active to get Mark Si
dran elected as ma yor, because firs
t of all, he is Jewish and he 
tries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn™t be 
there. Again, people like
 Œ that put up that 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
89 
 
swastika, and he™s defi nitely, of course, against 
that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism. 
And lately we have seen a li
ttle bit of that in Seattle. 
Q: What does that do to you? 
A: It bothers me . And again, that™s why I™m ve
ry much in support of Mark Sidran for ma yor. 
And hopefully he will have a police 
chief that can do the right thing. 
Q: When you see pictures of victims in Rw
anda or the Sudan, what does that do to you? 
A: That bothers me , definitely. 

Q: Because of your childhood? 

A: I™m sure it is, and again I say why does that ha
ppen?  Again, I was all for the U.S. to help out 
with troops over there. I didn't like the way it wa
s taken out. And again, i-it bothers me, is just 
like the U.S. could have helped ma ny million of 
Jews being sa ved. And why they aren™t helping 
out further bothers me . I don™t like what happened 
in Iraq. I think they Œ it was good for us to be 
in there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in
 Iraq, which is still over 
there. And those things 
bother me. 

Q: Do you think you are more sensitive to that th
an those of us who did not grow up in Europe? 
A: I™m sure I am, I™ m sure I am. I know a lot of pe
ople, including Jews in S
eattle that did not like 
us going into Rwanda or Iraq and so forth. They
 say why should we get involved?  I said, the 

same  reason we should have been involved to save Jews. And some  of them, like I say, even 

other Jewish people I kn
ow, were against that. 
Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences? 

A: Yes, lately I have. I have spoken to two differe
nt rotary clubs in the Seattle area. I spoke to 
the troops in Fort Lewis, mostly officers. In fa
ct, had a long talk afterw
ards with the assistant 
commanding general of Fort Lewis, a two star
 general. And yes, I do talk about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
90 
 
Q: Why?  
A: Again, like I say, it cannot be forgotten 
and the people, so ma ny of the younger generation, 
are not learning enough in s-school
s. And I™m talking about even
 college students do not know 
enough about it, and they should know. And that™s
 why it feels very impo
rtant, people like me , 
survivors of the concentration camps, should sp
eak publicly. And in Seattle now, we have the 
Holocaust Education Center, and they get the re
quests for speakers and I am signed up as a 
speaker. 

Q: Do you Œ have you been to any conferences? 

A: Yes, I attended the Child Survivors of th
e Holocaust Conference in Prague, and was the 
chairman of that ho Œ Child Surv
ivors Conference of the Holocaust 
in Seattle, that we had last 
September. And the Œ prior to this
 I did not, as my ex 
didn™t want me  to go to any of that. But Œ 
and now I plan to go, as long as I™m healthy, I 
plan to go to every one. The next one is in 
Houston in October, and the follo wing year it™ll be in Montreal. 
And right now I™m not at liberty 
to say there™s another city in a
nother state that wants to have a 
conference. And they have asked 
me  to help them organize it because they were in
 Œ the ma in organizers were in Seattle, and Œ 
and again, that state has very fe
w survivors, which of course Wa
shington state has, and I put on, 
I feel, a fairly decent conference. 

Q: How is it that you got to be 
the one to put on 
the conference? 
A: We ll, first of all, the people 
in Seattle know what I™ve been ve
ry active. I serv
e on the United 
States Olympic Committ ee, and we put on seve
ral fundraisers that 
I have headed. And 
incident ally, Governor Rosellini is the head 
of the U.S. Olympic Committ ee for Wa shi ngton 
state. I have also been involve
d in professional associations 
where I have put on conferences 
here. At that time data processing ma
nageme nt association, of which Œ

End of Tape Four, Side A

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
92 
 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: Œ museum volunteer colle
ction interview with Fred Taucher, a
nd this is tape four, side B, and 
you were talking about putting on conferences. 
A: And anyhow, some  of the peopl
e in Seattle, the surv
ivors and so forth, knew that I had been 
very active in different activiti
es, putting on conferences and banquets and so forth. When I was 
in Prague, at the conference there, I was asked if
 Seattle could put th Œ on the conference, since 
initially it was scheduled for Vancouver, B.C., about
 a two hour drive from Seattle. And if Œ they 
cancelled the Vancouver consom Œ c onference, but sti
ll wanted it, and then asked if we could put 
it on in Seattle. And I said, if I can get the pr
oper facilities, yes. A
nd so I found the proper 
facilities and then I got the survivor s Œ child surv
ivors of the Holocaust in Seattle, there were 
about eight or nine of them. And I presented that, and with the exception of two people that 

dropped out, they asked me  to be the chairman of  it. And that™s how it came about that I headed 

that conference. 
Q: And obviously you feel a connectionto these other child survivors. 
A: Oh, I certainly do. And we Œ we meet monthly. And we™re just a small group, but we do me et 

monthly and kind of talk about how 
we survived and what we can do. 
Q: Are you proud of yourself that you were able 
to ma ke a life after such a difficult childhood? 
A: Yes, I am. I am very proud of what has happe
ned, and some of it I blame my parents for it. I 
mean, they tre Œ they raised us Œ and I™m saying 
rus Œ us, my  brother and I, the proper way, even 
as young as we were. And I am proud of my acco
mplishments and I am proud of my  brother™s 
accomplishments. Be Œ being Œ going in as a private recruit in the army, no college  education, 

working up to a field grade officer, which a ma joris, he can be proud of himself, and I am proud 

of hi m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143

Q: Did he marry? 
A: We ll, he actually has been Œ he™s on the th
ird ma rriage right now. And as you probably know, 
a lot of survivors do have troubles
 staying ma rried, but he now is ma rried to a girl from s Œ 
originally from Scotland, and they™ve 
been ma rried now for about 22 years. 
Q: Does he have children? 

A: He has one daughter from his very first ma r 
Œ ma rriage, which he never should have ma rried, 
and then he has two boys from his second ma rriage.
 I think he is some what in contact with one 
of the boys. And he has two children, a boy 
and a girl from his present ma rriage. 
Q: Oh. Did you, when you c Œ came to this country, 
try to stay in touch with Frau Noelting? 
A: Yes, we did, we wri Œ have 
written to her, but e Œ I think 
she wrote back once, and it was a 
very disturbing letter. She still Œ 
she was just as upset when we 
left Germany, and also wrote to 
us. First of all, she cr
iticized the ge Œ the poor
 spelling and so forth, and grammar we used in 
German. Of course, we ha d a second and third gr
ade education. So of course our writing skill 
wasn™t very good in German. [sneeze] Bless you. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: And she criticized that and 
she really criticized us going to the U.S. And I think we  did 
answer her, but we never heard anything from her.
 Now, my  brother, when he was stationed as a 

military soldier Œ in fact I think he was a lieutenant
 or a captai n at that time in the army Œ excuse 

me  Œ and he was stationed in Heidelberg, he did 
visit Tr owta(ph) Noelting, the stepdaughter, and 
they did get together. And I think they had a ve
ry good get together, and I think it was shortly 
after Frau Noelting had passed away
, and they talked about her. She Œ she was very old in age, 
and really didn™t want to di
e, but she knew she was dying. 
Q: So your only contact with Frau Noelting wa
s that one letter, and then her return Œ  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
94 
 
A: That™s what I can reme mber, and I™m pre
tty sure my brother will agree to that. 
Q: And then what was your connection with We r ner Nathan? 
A: Again, I actually visited him w
ith my ex-wife in New Jersey. A
nd again, it must have been Œ I 
was an officer in the Data Processing Manageme
nt Association and we had a convention in New 

York, that my ex went with me . And that must have
 been in ™69 or ™70 and we went to visit him, 
but then I lost track. I n Œ lost 
track of hi m once when I went to
 Korea in the army, but then I 
found his address again and actually was able to
 look him up. And he was doing very well, he 

had a very successful ber Œ furniture business. We 
went to his house. In fact, he picked us up at 
the airport, I think, in a ne w Cad
illac at that time, I reme mber it. 
And he was very well off. But 

then again we lost track. Again I was in the mi
dst of building a business and spending too much 
time in the business and didn™t take time to wr
ite. And then I know I had written him again 
ma ybe six months or a year late
r and the letter came back and 
no forwarding address. So Œ and 
that™s when we lost track. And he ma y be Œ ma yhave moved out of Newa rk. But I have tried to 
look it up on the internet, but unless they ha
ve a listed phone number, you can™t find them.  
Q: Do you receive reparations? 

A: No. And this is again one of my reasons that
 I™m going to Germany ne xt month. It™s one thing 
Œ first of all I play to reestablish my German 
citizenship. I have found out a lot of survivors, 
especially in our new group here, have rees 
Œ established their citi
zenship and I know some  
people are getting as mu ch as 1100 dollars 
a month pension from the German government. 
Q: When you say your new group, what do you mean?  

A: The group that we have for med, each state 
has for med their own little group, a survivor™s 
group and then we are combining it as the Holo
caust Survivor Foundation,
 and all the various 
other groups. For instance, in Seattle we have
 formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
95 
 
Recovery Project. And we are going to join as an
 affiliate. We™re still separate corporations, but 
we will be pa rt of the Holocaust  Survivors Found
ation. And a number of these people, they are 
all elected officials from their 
own state, just like I am pres
ident of the Wa shington state group. 
And Œ and a lot of these people have reestablishe
d their German citizenship because now in the 
U.S., dual citizenship is permitted. And by reesta
blishing the German citizenship, there is a 
chance to recev Œ receive a pe
nsion. And I™m goi ng to take ev
ery penny I can get out of the 
German government. 
Q: Why?  

A: Well, they took too much away from my parent
s and from me , and I thi
nk I have a moral right 
to get some  monies out of Œ I 
can live without it, I don™
t need the money, but I think morally it™s 
right for me  to get some  money. 

Q: What are your thoughts about 
Holocaust survivors today who ar
e indigent or in Œ in dire 
straights? 
A: We ll, this is Œ I have a real problem with the Œ you have the Claims  Conference, that has 
received billions of dollars. In
 fact, the U.S. governme nt gave 
them four million dollars. And the 
Œ there are people, especially in Miami that ar
e living out on the street and begging for food, that 
are concentration camp s urvivors and not receiv
ing any mone y. We  had, at our me eting two days 
ago, we had Gideon Taylor, the Œ I guess the s 
Œ executive vice president from the Claims 
Conference talking and say well, 
half of the survivor
s are living in Israel, and the Claims 
Conference also has to look out for the people li
ving in Israel. And we have built me morials. 
Well, we don™t want me morials. We  want mone y fo
r the people that need it the most, and so we 

are trying to do some thing. And first of Œ also, th
e Claims Conference is ma de up of mostly self 
appointed people that are not Holo
caust survivors. And it should 
be Holocaust survivors that do 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
96 
 
the distribution of the funds. And that™s what 
we are working on right now, even if Œ if it™s 
necessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. A
nd they have to release so me money because 
our people are dying. I have the 1999 tax return 
from the Claims Confere n
ce. Oh, I didn™t bring 
it with me. I didn't bring it with me, but where th
ey had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or 
income  of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don™t have money to pay the people that ne ed it 
the most. That is not right. And Mr. Gideon Tayl
or, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was 
184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I 
don™t know what those benefits are, plus 
expense mo ney that we don™t know how much. Th
at shouldn™t be. And 
we are, our group is 
trying to do some thing about it, a
nd that™s why we me t here in Wa shington last November, and 
just this week. So in fact, I think you said you were at the Œ at our meeting place. 

Q: Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust? 

A: I™m afraid not. I am hoping that they did, but
 did they really?  Look what was going on in 
Yugoslavia. Even going back to Cambodia, the 
killing fields in Ca mbodia. I don™t think they 
have learned, but I don™t think anything has been
 as bad what it was th
rough the Œ during the 
Nazi regi me . 

Q: Why do you say that? 

A: Well, were six million Jews Œ people tortured and murdered. Children put to death. Yes, there 

were a lot of them, but I don™t think that ma ny. A
nd forced in sof Œ put into forced labor until 
they couldn™t stand up any more and then murdere
d. I think when they were murdered, they were 

murdered a little more quickly than what th
e Germans did. But a Œ a lesson learned?  No, I™m 
afraid not. And again, it will take countries like 
the U.S., Great Britain or  other fr ee countries to 

ma ke sure it doesn™t happen again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
97 
 
Q: When we  were walking in the museum, we
 saw these young high school students outside. 
What lesson would you like to pass on to t
hose young people who were standing in line? 
A: When you see things like this happen, don™
t let it ha ppen. If you are in military age and you 
get asked to serve in your military in Œ of your
 country, which appear to be  American, U.S., 
serve, and serve proudly. I feel 
very strongly again, a
bout the Vietnam wa r. It was wrong, we all 
know it was wrong. But for every American that refu
sed to serve, some body else went and died 
for it. While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some
 of his personal pr oblems, as a president he 
did a fairly good job. He was a real
 friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him 
and never would vote for him, strictly because he 
said when he  was 13 years old, I think, he said 
he was going to be president of the U.S.A.
 some day. And some body, with that being in mi nd, 
avoiding the draft, going to 
a foreign country, and demonstr
ating against his own county Œ 
country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to
 be a president. And that™s why I never voted 
for that ma n. Like I said just earlier, every Am
erican ma n that refused to serve, some body else 
went and died for it. Look at me , I was in the U.S.
 for five years, getting out of hell, but I served 
my country, and I was proud to serve. My brothe
r served this country, and proud to serve, both 
of us as offi cers. 

Q: You said that you Œ earlier on that you lost
 your childhood, you were
n't a little boy after 
awhile. Did you ever ge
t that childhood back? 
A: No, no, that™s Œ that™s gone forever. I will sa
y that when my brother and I first came to the 
States and lived in Kansas City, we for so
me  reason started loving watching cowboy movies. 
We™d go all over Kansas City, if there was a co
wboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry, 
Johnny McBrown, I can still reme mber some  of t
hose names, we loved to watch those movies. 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
98 
 
And ma ybe that™s ma ybe comi ng back a Œ a chil
dhood where kids ma ybe at the age of 10 would 
love that. We were 13 and 14 
and we loved those movies. 
Q: Did you t-talk about your parents with your 
brother once you got to 
the United States?  Is it 
still a topic of conversation? 
A: Yes, at first we definitely 
did and we always for ma ny years th
ereafter. We  talk
ed about it, we 
wondered where our mother was. And probably my 
brother more so than I, that I quit talking 

about it. We  talked about our mother and father 
and he would start crying. And for some  reason I 
Œ I would not Œ I Œ I mean, maybe mentally I 
was stronger than he was, I am not sure. 
Q: Is Œ is it that he™s more emotional that you?   

A: He Œ he is more Œ 

Q: What Œ what do you attribute the di
fference in response to your childhood? 

A: I don™t know. Again, ma ybe Œ I was younger and 
my brother was a year older and I think 
ma ybe he matured more Œ he was mo re ma ture in 
that respect than I was. A-Again, I can™t really 
give you a full answer. But I reme mber more. And yet, when it came to me mory of our parents, 

my brother was much more emotional than I was. 

Q: Did he have more awareness of the danger that
 you were in, or do you think it was equal, that 

your awareness was the same  as his? 

A: We  were both aware equally, but my brother 
was more a-afraid, more
 scared, not only of 
being caught by the SS or the Nazi
s, but also he was scared, ve
ry scared of the bombi ng. That 
frightened him, when he could hear the bombing,
 the artillery, the anti-aircraft. He was very, 
very frightened.  

Q: Wa s it because of sound for Œ he was more se
nsitive to sound? You said he wanted to be a 
pianist. Do you think maybe the sound was more harsher for him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
99 
 
A: You know, I never th Œ gave that a thought, but 
he is very musically inclined, and now is a 
very excellent pianist, 
incidentally. And I never gave that 
a thought, but ma ybe that™s what it is. 
He Œ his sound is better. I mean, I tried to take
 a Œ violin lessons, but I™m just not musically 
inclined. But a Œ I don™t know
 if that™s it or not. 
Q: Wa s he as physically strong as Œ as you? 
A: Probably more so physically stro
ng. Again, in sports, he wa s much better in sports than Œ than 
I was, especially in baseball. Too bad I bra Œ 
didn™t bring it aga Œ 
along, I should ha Œ should 
ma ke a picture. In 1947, the ﬁKansas City Starﬂ ha
d a picture of us both first comi ng to the U.S., 

to Kansas City, and we were playing baseball
. I think my brother was a batter and I was a 
catcher.  

Q: What did baseball represent to you? 

A: America. And we learned how 
to play baseball very quickly. 
I was never very good at it and 
my brother was. I was a better swimme r, I Œ than
 my brother was. I think in Œ in sports my 
brother was much better than I was, except for 
swimmi ng, which I could do better. I guess I am 
more in a individual sport like swimmi ng and ma
rtial arts and so forth, while my brother was 
more in a team type of s ports, like baseball. 
Q: What are your children™s name s? 

A: My son™s name  is Wa lter and 
my daughter™s name  is Audr ey. 
Q: Are they name d after anybody specifically? 

A: Walter was named aft er my uncle, who was a 
lawyer. No, I had two uncles by the name  of 
Walter. One of them wa s a lawyer and one of th
em was a doctor Œ a Œ a de
ntist. And Audrey, her 
mi ddle na me we gave to Œ as Teresa, which wa
s our mother™s name . But actually, she thinks Œ 
she and her mother are very close, and she and 
I are very close and she doesn™t hold our divorce 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
100 
 
against each other. She Œ she understands her mo ther, and Œ but she did change her mi ddle name 
to Cavanno(ph), my mother™s ma iden na
me. I mean, my wife™s maiden name. 
Q: Do you think that the Œ the interest in the Holo
caust now is some thing that™s permanent or just 
a passing Œ 

A: No, I think it™s permanent. Y
eah, I think it™s very permanent 
and my daughter is very much 
interested in it. When we had the conference in S
eattle, the Child Survivor s of the Holocaust, my 
daughter went to Seattle to partic
ipate in it. Because Œ I was proba
bly one of the first to include 
second generation, much to the disagreement of the previous people from the Child Survivors. 

But I included quite a number of the sec
ond generation, I had semi nars that both second 
generation and survivors could attend, because I 
found out some  Œ a lot of the second generations 
wanted to be involved and hear fr
om other survivors than
 just their parents. And so I did include 
a number of activities th
e second generation, and my daughter 
did attend a lot of the sessions.  
Q: Is there anything you wanted to talk
 about that we haven™t touched on? 
A: No, I think we have pretty much touched ev
erything, and I have Œ real
ly feel good being able 
to give my story. And I think we™ve covere
d anything, unless you think of anything else you 

wanted to cover. 

Q: Do you feel that you™ve lived a normal
 life after the war, 
once you got settled? 
A: Yes, I feel I lived a normal life. I am fortuna
te that I was able to build up a business with a 
very mi ni mum education. A lot of my education 
is self study. I™ve led here lately a very 
comfortable life. I will say back
 in the 60™s when I star ted the 
business, it was not easy. It was 
working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, some tim
es not taking a paycheck but ma de sure all 
employees got paid. But lately I™ve lived a very co
mfortable life and I think I can live the rest of 

USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143  
101 
 
my life comfortably. And again, like
 I say, I enjoy traveling and I do 
quite a bit of it, and I just 
hope my hea lth will hold out. But until it
 holds out, I™m going to enjoy life. 
Q: We ll, that™s a wonderful note to end on. Th
ank you very much for doing the interview. 
A: Sure, it™s Œ really, I am glad
 I was able to talk about this. 
Q: This conc ludes the United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Fred Taucher.
