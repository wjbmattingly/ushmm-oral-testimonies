[indecipherable]
 that t hat portrait was stolen i n 
Russia
 with the few belongings

A: No, I don™t remember. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: But I think it™s listed somewhere. I don™t remember exactly. 
Q: The reason I focus on this, because I want t o get a sense of whether your 

mother™s family were landowners.  

A: Oh, thi s was the la Œ the la Œ that property was given by the government 

because of mother™s brother be Œ taking part in a Polish ri Œ let™s see, the rise of 

that territory, because remember, 
Poland
 
was divided 
be- before that. 
Q: And divided in what  wa y?

Polish word, and an English word, and I can™t Œ 
Poland
 was divided Œ

kind of battles, or some kind of Œ 
A: Well, he Œ he wa Œ he de-deserved some compensation from the government , 
because 
he put Œ he was in that cat egory of helping the Œ those that fought for the 

liberation of 
Poland
. 

Q: Thank you. That™s what I wanted to understand, how it is that he got some land. 

So that meant he fought for Polish independence during and after the first World 

War. Is that correct? 

A: Yeah, mm-
hm.
 
Q: Oka y. Okay. And so the land was then given to him.

she could do so much Œ a woman can do so much, but in her

Q: Oka y. 
A: Wehad ver 
Œ relatively little contact, or communicati on with the Œ with the 
country itself, because we were si mply the refugee 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah
,  yeah
. And if you sta yed there four years, that means that  it was the late 
1940s before you left, yes? 
A: About t hat. We left after the 
India

Danuta
 born? In
 Britain
? 
A: In 
Britain
. 

Q: I see. Is there anythi ng else,
 Mira
, that I have not asked you, that you think is 

important for peopl e to know, about your story? 

A: There was an incident about the goats. After work Mother went to the edge of 

the camp, and cut down those young twigs that just sprout out l eaves. And at that 

time she used to si ng, she used to Œ to tell me Œ 
taught me 
Œ well, I guess, the 
poem. I d Œ I don™t remember the Œ that Œ t he author, what ever, but anywa y, we Œ 
we were pla ying, the ki ds were pla yi ng hide and seek or something, and I Œ I was 

with them. The y st arted to go Œ go on the loft. Well, going back t o the problem 

what Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, it was po 

Œ essential that you don™t shake the Œ the bundl es, because the leaves would fall 

off, and the goats woul dn™t get any food. So you had Œ Mother 
make me be 
Œ 
listen very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-t alk to the kids, not to go and pla y on Œ 

in the loft. Well, one ti me the kids made comments about this and that. Finally, 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015

one said, oh, to the ghost, that they Œ that t he y heard noises, whatever, like finall y 
one of them sa ys Œ sa ys, oh, if we ta Œ sa y a prayer, it will all right. 

Q: Oka y, so the y thought that Œ 

A: So we started sa yi ng a prayer, but the boy Œ I don™t know which prayer it was, 

but anywa y, the y started saying a pra yer, and I was saying the same ti  Œ pra yer, 
but I Œ I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all  those kids going up 
there. Final ly, I decided not Œ not to sa y a prayer. 

Q: Not to sa y one. 

A: No – not to sa y a prayer. 

Q: Were you able to keep them from going upstairs to the loft? 

A: Well, he did – 

Q: So 
Mira
, it™s oka y. Again, this is something you™ll remember later. That often 
happens to people. 
A: No. It™s a Œ 

A2: You were wor Œ one or two words behind in the pra yer, and they thought it  

was a ghost. Remember that part of it? 

A: The what? 

A2: You were sa yi ng it , the prayer, one or two words behind, and they t hought i t 

was a ghost, remember? 
A: Not that one, no.

A2: No?  
Q: That™s oka y. 

A: No. 

Q: It™s oka y. Is there anyt hing else you™d like t o add to what we™ve tal ked about? 

A: Well, I don™t know, you™ve been very patient with me, but Œ and t his is 
a 
Œ 
a 
somewhat unfair trial for me. 
Q: I can understand that, and I appreciate Œ I know that it has taken a lot of 
strength and energy to t alk about. Thank you. Thank you for doing it. I think what 

I™ll do now, is that  we™ll conclude our interview, the 
United States Holocaust

Q: Oka y. This is t he 
United Stat
es
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
i nterview wi th 
Danuta Soletski
(ph)
 
Urbika s
, on January 23
rd
, 2015. And 
Danuta
, I want you to 
tell us a little bit about how you are related to 
Mira
, and how you have come to 
know about her story. So.  
A: So, 
Mira
 and I have the 
same mother. My mother met  m yfatheri nthatwhole 
turmoil during World War II, after he was rel eased from the prisoner of war camp, 

and she and 
Mira
 were released from Œ wel l, they escaped actually, from the labor 

camp. And it was i n 
Tatishchevo
,  near 
Sar
atov
, where was the first Polish army 
camp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't 

been murdered in the 
Soviet Union
. So they met there briefl y, and t hey actually 

met  again later on in 
Jelibod
(ph), which was i n 
Uzbekist
an
, or I don™t know, it™s 
on the border, near 
Ta shkins
(ph). 
Ta shkins
(ph) was anot her area where the 
Polish army had gone, and this is ma ybe 1500 miles or more awa y from 

Tatishchevo
, or near 
Saratov
. 

Q: Oka y. So I would li ke to Œ for us to trace. I mean, some of the things that I 

asked 
Mira
, she di dn™t remember where she wa Œ you know, what the towns were, 
and so on. And tell me, how is it t hat you know all of these places? 

A: Well, m y mother tal ked about t hese experiences the whole ti me I was growing 
up. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had m y first child, she 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015

agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on 
this project to get i t in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the 

history. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you 

know, interviewed m y parents, mostly my father, and also other hi storians who 

were aware of Œ of this migration, this whole journe y of these people that had been 
deported. 
Q: Oka y, so I™d like to start from Œ from the beginning at least, but we™ll run 

through it, oka y? 

A: Oka y. 

Q: So, 
Mira 
was born in 
Gro dno
, and that was in what part of 
Poland
? 
A: That at t he time was eastern 
Poland
. Today it is 
Belarus
, right on t he border 

really, with 
Lithuania
 and Œ and not too far from where the current  border of 
Poland
 is. 

Q: Oka y. And from 
Gro dno
, do you know what deportation the y were taken on? 
Was it the February one? 

A: The February 10
th
 one, yes, in 1940. 
Q: Oka y. And where were the y taken to?  

A: The y were taken first to a camp at Œ across the 
Urals
, which woul d have been 

technically 
Siberia
. And I™m trying to remember the Œ 
one was 
Mikelinska
(ph), 
do you remember t hat name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank. 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015 
 
 
 
68
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But the y were first there for ma ybe a few months, and this was in winter. And 

then the y were taken back to another camp near 
Perm
, which is of 
Molotov
. And 
that was where the y reall y were for the duration of the time in the Œ in the labor 

camp. 
Q: So
 Perm
 was a pret ty tough p
l ace.
 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: The Œ some of the stories that 
Mira
 shared with us today, are they ones that 

you are fami liar wit h, t hat you had heard about before? 

A: Oh yes, I grew up with these st ories, you know, but Œ you know, t hese were 

things that  were discussed, especially at Œ during holida y times, or whenever our 

Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, 
and the y would start to talk about all these things. Or just  Sunday dinners, you 
know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my 

mother. You know, my father talked about i t, but m y mother was very Œ  you 

know, she Œ she wo Œ she went through so much, you know? 

Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I™m clear about, she had to 

work as a lumberjack? 

A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, ma ybe not as tall  as I am, but she 
was, you know, generall y speaking, the Œ the Soviets took people who were 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015 
 
 
 
69
 
working in the country to do the harder jobs, because the y were honed better. And 
the people who were in the cities were doing li ghter work. And as 
Mira
 was 
sayi ng, there was no one else f Œ to work for them. It was just m y mother. And so 

they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, t o work in the 

forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that the y 
felled, and Œ and yes, there was one occasion when she Œ I don™t know, you know, 
she was so tired by then, and Œ and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated 

by the whole experi ence, because for her it was a constant  worry about saving 

Mira
, that she didn™t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And Œ and so this 
tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, the y Œ and 

watched this tree coming towards her, and at t he last second she jumped into li ke a 

pile of rubble, and t he Œ the branches from this rubble act ually cut  the Œ 
Q: Broke the Œ 
A: Œ broke the fall. So she Œ she was in there, and they thought Œ the Soviets, the 

brigadier, the supervisor of the Œ of the work t eam thought she was tryi ng to kill 

herself, you know. And so the y got mad at  her for Œ for, you know, doing that. 

And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up 

getting ga new job working Œ fixing Œ changing the oil on tractors, and also filling 

Œ there was one steam t ractor that she had t o fill water. And she got paid more for 
that. But, you know, in the co Œ in the course of all of that, you know, she di Œ she 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015 
 
 
 
70
 
almost did end up in jai l, because she was very patriotic and she woul d taunt the 
Soviets, especially the Œ the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or 

Byelorussi an™s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing 

Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just reall y Œ she kind of did things that 

didn™t help her, you know, and that™s anot her t hing that happened. So when she 
went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were Œ the y were just Œ 
you 
know, it was kind of vengeance from that parti cular barracks supervisor that didn™t 
like her. 

Q: Oka y. I wanted to get a sense of how this Œ how this developed, the context of 

such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having ha y. 

A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the ha y, and t hen there was 

another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten Œ l ike gone back t o 
get a jacket, or somethi ng, because it was start ing to rain. And that one was 
actually a much more serious one. But the first ti me I think the y docked her for, I 

think a third of her pa y, which was just ast ronomical because she wasn™t getting 

paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a l oaf and a half of bread a 

day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult. 

Q: Oka y. And did you ever know, or did she ever Œ was she ever t old why she was 

deported?  
A: Because she was a l andowner. 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015 
 
 
 
71
 
Q: That™s what I thought, that™s what I thought. 
A: And Œ and also, I thi nk the y ma y have al so known that her Œ they were still 

married, even though t hey were separated, her husband was a Œ 
a soldier, you 

know, he was sergeant in the arm y. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. All  right, so when it comes to 1941, and there™s t he agreement 
between the Polish government in exile, and t he 
Soviet Union
 to release people 
who had been citizens of 
Poland
 who had been deported, the y learned about it 

from a former prisoner, rather than officials. 

A: Right, they Œ t he Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it 

was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about 

this, and so m y mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but 

the y weren™t  Œ the y reall y did not want to give it to her, so essent ially, the y 
escaped.
 
Q: So tell me, this incident what Œ  that 
Mira
 was talking about, where she would 
be a Red Cr oss nurse, and 
Mira
 would be left in an orphanage, was this Œ 
A: Well, that™s much later, actually. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: That™s much later. Yeah, at Œ when Œ when m y mother and sister were escaped 

from the labor camp, they made their way down the 
Volga
. And t his i s that 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman  
 
January 23, 2015 
 
 
 
72
 
incident with the li ttle girl falling and being ki lled in the steamboat. And the y 
made it to Œ oh, now I™m drawing a blank. I think 
Kra-Krasnovodsk
, you think?  
A2: 
Kra-K rasnovodsk
. 

A: 
Krasnovodsk
. And then they went from there, down t he 
Caspian 
Sea
 to 
Pahlevi
, ri ght?  Or no, actually, I™m skippi ng something. There was a lo Œ there 
was Œ all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there Œ you 
know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And 

there was 
a huge mass ofpeople,andthe y na 
Œ they didn™t know where to put 

them. So i n the southern 
Soviet Union
, t he y were traveling by train back and 

forth, trying to find a pl ace to Œ to go. Finally t hey ended up getting out after that. 

And in that turmoil, that™s when the y met m y father again, okay? 

Q: I see. 
A: So, because getting out of the 
Soviet Union
 already, things were much better 
by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these 

resettlement  camps, and one was i n 
Teheran
, and t
hat™s where my motherand 

Mira
 were there. I™m not sure it was for as long as she sa ys it was, but it was 
many months. And m y mother studied nursing at that poi nt, in English. And so, 

she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, the y ended up in
 
India
, and 
there were there as Œ 
as 
Mira
 
said, youknow, forseveral years,wit h m y mother 

 
Interview with Mira Zi mmerman

being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and 
Mira
 went to a convent school 
that was set  up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation. 
Q: Oka y. Now, let me go back to t he 
Soviet Union
 a little bit. I want to get a sense 

more of the geography. So from what I understand from you™re tel ling me, is that 
the camp the y ended up staying i n was bet Œ was in 
Perm
, the region of 
Perm
.  
A: Oh, the labor camp, yes. 

Q: The labor camp. From t here the y escaped, and made their wa y t o a river, where 

they were in a steamboat, and then went down to 
Krasnovodsk
, is that wh-where 

you were sa yi ng? 

A: The y went to 
Ta
tishchevo
. 
Q: 
Tatishchevo
. 

A: Near as Œ 
Q: And what is 
Tatishchevo
? 
A: It™s a city or town near 
Saratov

Q: And what was his st ory, in brief? How did he end up t here? 
A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and 

he was almost immediatel y captured actually, i n 
Lithuania
. And then from there 

he was sent Œ 

Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern 
Poland
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And so how di d he end up in 
Lithuania
? 
A: The y were trying to protect the 
Augusta

 Forest 
canals, and Œ from the 
Germans, and the y were Œ o-or no, ma ybe it was Œ I™m not sure now. I think it was 

Œ no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got Œ 
t hey got 
caught and Œ and sent to an internment camp in 
Lithuania
. And from there the y 
were sent Œ he was sent  to the camp in 
Kozelsk
. 
Q: 
Kozelsk

under theSoviets, excuse me.
 
A: Right, right. 
Q: And Œ and he was not Œ he was not shot. 

A: No, there was Œ hi Œ  at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these 

officers were being sent somewhere, but t he y didn™t know where. And he was 
taken, actual ly, to Œ they were going to build an airstrip or somet hing up further 
north, in the tundra, and Œ at 
Grazovietz
 they were stopped, because at that point 

Germany
 had in Œ  attacked 
Poland 
Œ 
I mean, 
Russia
, and so the y were camped 
there for a while. And t hen, of course, the Poli sh government agreed, you know, 

th-that Œ there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army.  

A2: 
Armestu
(ph). 

A: It was ca Œ 
yeah, was

.
 
Q: And how is it that he met 
Mira

little food, and my mot her was Œ 
our mother wastrying tofind, you know,food,
