FRIDA WALLENSTEIN 
November 1, 1990 
 
Question:  Would you tell me  your na
me  please and where you were born? 
 
Answer:  Frida Wa llenstein, and I wa s born in 
Czecho...in what was at the time Czechoslovakia, 
in a small town called Selo-Solotvina (ph). 

 

Question:  Tell me a little b
it about your life as a child. 
 

Answer:  My fa mily mo ved from Cz echoslovakia 
to Belgium when I was about two and a half 
years old.  I had a sister
 who was also born in Czechoslovakia.
  My parents were working people 
and my little sister  was born in the Liege (ph), Belgium, where we lived until I came to the 

States.   

 

Question:  And can you desc
ribe your life 
as a child? 
 

Answer:  We had wonderful parents who cared for 
their children, protected us, did everything to 
educate us, and until the war ca...until the war 
came , we we had a very close-knit family. 
 

Question:  Was this a very Jewish family? 

 

Answer:  Yes.  My...my uh (cough) both my
 parents came from orthodox, very orthodox 
background.  My father didn't want
...did not want to keep it but my
 mother was...kept...likedto 
keep the orthodox but we lived in a city...Liege 
did not have a large Jewish uh community.  We  
had a synagogue.  We  had a haider (ph).  I went to
 haider and I learned to uh to to read Hebrew.  
I uh also had private tutors to teach me  to read
 and write Yiddish.  I used to read and write 
fluently in Yi ddish, but the the...the re was one 
kosher butcher and because of the life style in 
Belgium, the kosher laws as I grew up were not 
kept and especially, of
 course, during the war 
and during the years hi ding.  So I had forgotten about the kosher uh laws until I came to the 

States to live with my a unt, but my parents 
both came from an orthodox 
fa mily.  We went to 
services during the high holy days and I was not
 bar mitzvah because the orthodox Jews did not, 

but we assimilated mor e ...we were Jewish but c
ould not keep the strict kosher laws because 

Liege did not have enough of a Jewish population 
to ke...to be able to 
keep up like with the 
kosher meats and things like that.  And the Belgiu
m cook with butter the same  as the French but 
my mother could never do it.  She did stay with
 no cooking with butter...meat with butter...she 
could never mi x it.  We  did, but we didn't, and 
for instance we have a lo
t of shrimp, a lot of 
seafood and that was never brought into our hom
e, never, never.  We  did keep kosher. 
 

Question:  In the terms of the social environm
ent at the time, what was life like for Jews? 
 

Answer:  Did not feel Jewish.  Did not feel 
any different.  I reme mber going to school during 
Passover with ma tzos because we did not eat brea
d, but I did not feel diffe
rent from any of the 
other uh children who...because Belgium is Catholic
, what Catholic there were.  There was only 
one girl I reme mber going to school with as a Jewish girl and my sister
s who followed after me ,

but there was nothing ever brought up or me nti
oned or name d as Jewish we  were known. There 
were a lot of Polish people in
 Belgium, and they could neve
r associate us as being Czech...uh 
Czechoslovakian.  They referred to my mother as
 the Polish tailor, and my mother didn't...never 
at no time  was anything or any reference ma de to
 the fact that we were Jewish.  Never. was 
never ma de ma de to feel different.  I'm...or I di
d not feel different or  separate because I was 
Jewish...no.  Never.  
 

Question:  Di d you have non-
Jewish friends and...? 
 

Answer:  All my friends, all my school friends
 except this one girl, 
and I was not friendly...uh 
she did not become  a close friend of mi ne until I 
went into high school.  In grade school all my 
school friends were Catholic.  There was no two ways about it, because there were not enough 

Jewish families to ha ve so me body of your age be 
in the sa me  class.  And we kept...uh when St. 
Nicholas Day came, we went along with the children.  When the Easter egg hunt came along, we 

went along.  We  went East
er egg hunting.  All my friends were 
Catholic.  I lived across the street 
from the church and every time you went by, you went
 like this, and I went the same  because all 
my friends were.  My mother never stopped me
.  I knew I was Jewish but you follow along with 
the children, but I knew I was Jewish.   

 

Question:  Ca n you reme mber what happened when the war came ?  

 

Answer:  Yes I do.  Germans ca me  i n and for two 
years we stayed at home
.  We continued living 
under war conditions...rations.  Uh we went to
 sc hool and uh we lived uh under occu...you know, 
occupation, the same  as everyone else and in two y ears, exactly two years later, then we were uh 

as Jews...then we started, the Germans started with
 the Jews in in at l
east Liege.  I don't  know 
what other part of Belgium did.  The first thing 
was, no rad...the Jews were not allowed to have 
radios.  We  were not allowed to go to school.  We 
had to register as Jews and that meant that we 

took identification cards to uh th
e Foreign Ministry and they stamped a big red stamp on it, on 
the inside that said Juda (ph), and we had to w
ear the uh ____ David on the 
chest.  As a ma tter of 
fact uh I reme mber distinctly the students from
 the colleges some  things and I don't know if 
mocking is the right term, used to wear them, 
the Star of David, and they made bonfires in 
mockery of the Jewish star, and uh I don't know...
it was a ma tter of days or a week, they...there 
were some  young people who had to go to a certai
n area and report as Jews and they had to go 
with clothing, with their with
 their ration stamps and clothi
ng and food and they were young 
teenagers, two of my very close friends uh that
 I was going to high school with.  The one I had 
gone to grade school also had to go.  I was fifteen. 
 They were about fourt
een.  They were just a 
little bit younger than I am, and the families let them go because no one knew, no one had any 

idea what the reason was, why, what for.  We  
knew in Belgium about the uh Jews escaping from 
Germany.  A lot of them ended up in Bel...in 
uh Belgium, but no one knew what what was 
happening, so they went, and I don't know if it was 
a week later, ten days
 later or a few days 
later, they called me n of certain ages and my 
father was called to go to, supposedly to Dunkirk 
(ph) to build up fortifications. 

 

Question:  ____________?

Answer:  And my father was called and I can see 
him...it was a Saturday and we lived upstairs of 
a cafe in an apartment.  My father came  up the 
stairway.  We  had just finished cleaning.  The 
door was open.  He had his hair shaven, and my mo
ther said where are you going?   He says I'm 
going to re port beca use if I do they promise not 
to touch the families.  And my mother said, I 
don't trust them.  And it was a matter of...I thi
nk all the Jews, and I'm talking Liege...now 
realized some thing was wrong, that we were 
being deported and everybody went panicking.  
Everybody went into going to hiding and... 
 

Question:  Le t's go back just a mo me nt.  When...t his is now two years after the start of the  war... 

 

Answer:  After the start of the war... 

 

Question:  Go back to the very start?  How did you feel when things began to change?    What 

happened in your life? 

 

Answer:  I I I don't... 

 

Question:  Do you reme mber?    

 

Answer:  You mean when we went
 into...when they started with...? 
 

Question:  No.  When the war ju
st began...what was it like for you? 
 

Answer:  What was it like?    We  had...my parents were were wonderful.  I mean everybody did 

the black ma rket like to have food and things
, and my parents did everything.  We  di d not 
feel...oh, I reme mber my mother wa
s afraid for me because she reme mbered the Kosacks (ph), 
you know, raping, and I was going on...let's see...I wa
s going on fourteen and she was afraid for 
me, but the the Germans...someone a sked me just
 not long ago if the Germans did anything like 
to rape a  woma n.   Germans, and I 'm talk
ing Liege...probably the whole Belgium, I'm not 
sure...were not allowed to approach a civilian 
on the streets.  They had houses, prostitution 
home s, reserved for soldiers.  They never never 
touched anyone on the str
eets, and I think, if I 
reme mber, this was done for propaganda purposes to show how good the Germans were, that 

they were not our enemies, but they never never touched a wo ma n.  Belgium had food.  

Anything we had...coffee, we used to roast coffee af
ter four years of war, and we had to close the 
windows because the coffee s melled when you roas
ted it.  We had rice...everything found its 
way on black ma rket.  My father, before we went
 into hiding, used to get on his bicycle and go 
and get, you know, the carp is not the same  as th
e American carp.  It's clean.  And he would sell 
that on the ma rket because that was not ratione
d.  They would...he would go to the farmers and 

someti mes like bring eggs because that was highly
 rationed.  Now the farmers had quotas to turn 
in depending on the size of their farms, whether it 
was butter or eggs, so what they used to do is 
they used to be quote, robbed.  Some body came duri
ng the night or early in the morning and they 
were robbed, and all of that found its way on the black ma rket, so as far as where we were in 

Belgium, we  had food.  We never went hungry.  Ne
ver.  Clothing...it's not the way of life here.  
You know, you bought a dress and you wore it until 
you outgrew it and then it went down to 
your younger sister and it was passed down.  My my 
mother had been a man's tailor, so whatever 
pieces of fabric were left around, we ma naged to
 scrounge, and we wore the same  things over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

and over, but we had clothes and for money you c
ould buy and it's hard to explain.  My parents 
were honest people but anyone w
ho understands war situ
ation knows that if 
you want to survive 
in an occupied country, you do black ma rkets. In
 other words, there were ration stamps.  I 
was...never had money floating in 
my hands as much as...that's be
fore we went into hiding...this 
is the first two years of war.  The ration stamps
 were like like postage stamps and they used to 
ma ke false ones.  They used to duplicate them
, like ma king fa ke money and it used to find its 
way on the black ma rket, and that's what my fath
er did and I don't know where he got his...he did 
not produce them.  I don't who produced them, but
 we...my father used to buy them, get them 
and sell them and ma ke money th
at way, and then wherever you c
ould get either farm produce or 
I don't reme mber meat but I rememb er distinctly
 fish and eggs, whatever, and especially the 
stamps so I was old enough that if a customer
 came and wanted stamps, you see, and you could 
tell they were fake.  But reme mber that 
the civilian...I mean Ge
rmans did not occupy 
everything and besides...they called them Alexis 
(ph) patrol Germans...t
hey were all...everybody 
had to because you had a pad of butter a month as
 a ration.  I learned to
 drink coffee without 
sugar for that reason, because my mot her saved it 
to ma ke jellies and things and to this day I 
don't drink coffee with sugar for for that reason, but
 anything you wanted except bananas.  Fresh 
fruit, because Belgium had Belgium Congo and you 
could find on black ma rket.  So we ate and 
there was uh, you 

know, I I reme mber the first German.  We were
 petrified of them, you know, but the Germans 
were not all over.  The country was run by Belgiu
m civilians, so you didn't  even see them that 
much.  It's  just that we had a uh a concern (ph) 
very close by with...a bloc
k, a block and a half of 
where I lived, so you did see more of the soldiers
 than ma ybe if you lived in an area where the 
concern (ph) was not close by, but otherwise it 
was all run and all occupied by by civilians, by 
by the Belgiums, so the first two years uh ther
e wa s noth...I did not...if I think back, besides 
seeing the first Germans and clinging to my
 mother, uh you know, you saw them coming with 
their rifles and as much as we could still co
mprehend uh once we got going I did not feel...there 
was no persecution.  There was nothing.  We  conti
nued to go to school, so there was nothing to 
make us feel...I think my parents sort of protected
 us to to to what really could be.  I don't know, 
but the br unt of it was on my parents because 
they had gone through Wor l d Wa r I with the, you 
know, the Kosacks and they reme mb ered but we didn't. 

 

Question:  ____the start of the war, 
those first few years, being Jewish... 
 

Answer:  Absolutely not.  It had...there was no di
fference.  We  were, we were the same  as the 
Catholics because it's predominantly Catholic.  I 
just reme mb er ma ybe there were Protestants in 
school, but even Catholic 
religion was taught in the public schools.
  Absolutely nothing.  No idea 
that it would...that there would 
be...I did not comprehend at the 
time, but I know that when the 
Germans invaded Poland and my mother, who I'm sure
 was very smart, wanted to come  to the to 
the United St ates, and we had one aunt, her sister
, the only one, in Cleveland, so I ended up in 
Cleveland, but it di dn't work out.  I won't go into it because...but uh and we knew of the, for 

instance, the Kristallnacht.  I did not comprehend 
it.  You have to reme mber that I was much 
younger and children were not, didn't have televisi
on like here today so we did not comprehend 
the full meaning of it.  We knew the German Jews were persecuted because German Jews came 

into Belgium in running away from Germany a nd 
we had German Jews there.  I personally as a 
young girl did not come  in contact with other young 
girls.  Whether adults came or they mainly 
ma ybe went to Antwerp or Brussels...Liege 
is not a cosmopolitan city where uh, you know, uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
5 
 
uh people from other countries came.  You know, uh 
in the capital city, y
our port...but I did not 
have any contacts that I reme mber with anyone
 who ca me  out of Ger many or...I think there 
ma y...proba bly most of t hem were German, not 
even Austrian...I think Ge r...I know Germans 
came in but I did not have any contact with
 them.  I did not kn
ow of any of them. 
 
Question:  When and how di
d things begin to change? 
 

Answer:  When we had to report as Jews
.   There was no school, no...we went...no school, no 
radios.  We  had to register as Jews and then
 they started deporting 
only the young people and I 
don't know i f they were boys.  For some  reason or
 other I...these two fr
iends of mi ne (coughing) 
...excuse me ...(coughing)...had to go and then when they
 called my father, that's when he went in 
to 

turn to this Catholic family who was very stau
nch.  They had a son who was Trappist monk as a 
ma tter of fac t , and he was in the country, knew 
of the house, rented the house for us for six 
months, and we moved there.  There were three 
rooms upstairs, two rooms downstairs.  We  had 
outdoor facilities.  My father gr
ew a garden, a big vegetable gard
en.  He helped the farmers and 
we used to go down to the farmer to get fresh m
ilk.  I can still taste the milk.  I couldn't drink it 
today.  It was just drained from the uh the cheese
cloth that they used to
 strain it.  We  burned 
wood and then this uh couple came to hide with 
us.  I don't know if it was a month or two after 
we went into hiding. She had worked for my pare
nts uh as a uh as a tail...
in tailoring.  He was a 
friend of the family who also, who had come  from
 Czechoslova kia.  He had joined us because 
we were from Czechoslovakia and they got ma
rried, and I don't know how they found out, but 

they knew where we were and they joined us so
we had my parents,a
nd I was the oldest of 
three...my two sisters...and then we had a cous
in who was eight years old at the time whose 
mother had died ma ny years befo
re when he was a young child whos
e father left him when the 
Germans started with the Jews.  He had rema rried
 and the stepmother brought him to us, so we 
had four in our fa mily, and then Rochelle (ph)
 and her husband and the baby who was not quite a 
year old.  They shared a room.  My parents 
had a room and I don't re me mb er where my little 

cousin slept, but the thre
e of us slept in one room and we had to go to the stream to get water and 
to heat the water.  We  had to use outdoor f
acilities and we had woods behind the house and 
far mland in front of us.  During the weed-cuttin
g season we used to go behind the farmers when 
they cut the weeds and we called it in Fren
ch _____...you follow the the fa rmers and you pick 
the weeds that is left behi nd.  We put  them in 
big burlap sacks, went down to the flour mills and 
then we used to...my mother used
 to prepare the bread and then 
take them to the farmers and 
bake them in the outdoor oven.  If you ever ta
sted...yes...bread baked in wooden ovens and uh we 

used to get...we had identification.  Our name s 
we re changed fr om...my ma iden name  was Adler 
and Frida is a German na me...it's a foreign name
, and my na me was changed to Fernand Albert 
(ph)...in English it's pronounced Albert, and my middl
e si ster, my little sister
 kept the same na me 
but my little cousin was Zeigmund which is typi
cally a German name .  Hi s father was from 
Czechoslovakia, so we changed it to Simone (
ph), which is Simon in English, and I reme mber 
we told him if you ever want to see your father, 
your name  is Simone Adler and you'r e not to tell 

anyone.  Of course, his father ma de it.  He didn'
t.  And it took no time at all for the Catholics 
around the villages to know we were Jewish but
 no one, no one ever...I me an I reme mb er one 
time the farmers ca me because the Germans we
re looking for I don't know what and we went 
into the woods and because the farmers warned us
.  My sister and I used to go into the city 
everyday to get our ration stamps on our real  
names and one time the citizens who were handing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

out the ration stamps...the German
s were looking for some thing or 
other, and they put us in the 
back of the old school until the Germans disapp
eared and then I don't know exactly how...before 
the Germans uh came to arrest the family and 
I think...I can't...don't know how my parents found 
out.  It ma y be the same  person who ma de out the 
false ID papers for us...
found a place for me  to 
go into the city and I became  a 
ma id.  It was a woma n.  She was 
from Alsace-Lorraine (ph).  She 
was a widow to a coal mi ning engineer and she ha
d a son who was at that time  forty years old 
who was a gynecologist and babies  were delivered at home in 
those days and he received 
patients in his home two afternoons a week and 
it was a wealthy home which means they had a 
live-in maid and someone who came three times a w
eek.  I went in.  They knew I was Jewish.  I 

went in and the two...the day woma n left, so I 
did the work of two wo
men.  I scrubbed white 
ma rble halls.  I scrubbed Persian rugs.  I sc
rubbed...I mean the wood...I don't know what the 
wood is called in English...it was...and the woman 
used to go, you know, this is coal furnaces, 
and she used to go like this to ma ke sure there 
was no dust.  I had...she did the cooking and then 
when he used to come  in, they used to have a 
cocktail because  this is typical French way of 
living and relaxing.  Wh en he went to deliv
er a baby, you know, they went hours before and 
when dinner...when they were ready for dinner they 
rang a bell, and I served 
and then I went into 
the kitchen and I ate my dinner and then 
if uh...you know the French eat everything on a 
different dish, and I did the dishes, not in a 
dishwasher, but we had...t
hey were wealthy enough 
to have water that was heated not in the same
 ma nner as here but the water was...you didn't have 

to heat it on the stove.  Also he received pati
ents.  I had to sterili
ze hi s instruments and I 
ma intained a house, a three-floor 
house, and you have to appreciat
e how to clean Persian rugs.  I 
mean not carpeting, her...we'r e back into Persian r
ugs.  Parquet, uh parquet, the real parquet that 
I had to scrub with my feet and the big pads 
and I stayed there until 
my sister, my mi ddle 
sister...my my sister Bertha wa
s also placed in a doctor's home in the country for that purpose 
also and she was not feeling well and the doctor told
 her to go home  to rest and that's when on a 
Sunday morning on May 5...I used to go home  ever
y other weekend on my bicycle.  Traveled by 
bicycle.  I used to go home  uh over night.  Sh
e...the lady of the house, the lady of the house 
allowed me  to go home, but usually ma ids used
 to go home , get weekends off but she took 
advantage of my situation.  I went home  every 
other weekend, and I got a phone call that was 
me ssaged (ph), saying to me  not to go home , a
nd I got...I understood that the Germans had been 
at the house.  Now to re-track...my fat her was 
ill and I...all I reme mber his eye was broken 
outside and like he had an ear 
infection, an eye infection.  The country doctor treated him, sent 
him to the hospital and of course the hospital was 
in the city in Liege.  He came to the hospital 
on Friday.  My sister wa s supposed to come  
in and bring him shaving cream and soap for 
bathing...you did not get these things...they were
 black ma rket, the good ones...and my  sister 
never came in and I got word that...I understood 
the fam...the  Germans came and the family and 
the other couple were picked up.  Doctor Bastat
 (ph) told...where I was in hiding...managed to 
get my fathe r  released from the hospital, went to
 the hospital and my fath
er and I got on a bus to 
go to the village to see what had 
happened and I'll never forget it.  My father went on one end of 
the bus, me  on the other end and he says if one
 of us gets picked up, we don't know the other 
one.  I can see my father.  If I would have been
 picked up, my  father ignoring me .  The n we saw 
the farmers and they told us that what they did 
is they went to...you know, this is this is a little 
village with little passage, little road, not even 
a road, leading to the house, and they brought the 
fa mily from the house to the main road and they
 questioned my my mother and my mother said 
that these were not their child
ren...her children, and they were 
there for her...their health,  
wh...which was common practice, because we cam
e
 from coal-mining countries and a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

children from the schools were sent to the countr
y, but they didn't take it and they asked where 
my father was and my little sist er said in the hospital, and I understand the German slapped her 
for lying.  This came from the farme r s who we
re there when the Gestapo picked up my...the 
fa mily and you know, all the people at five o'cloc
k in the morning.  Also, in between while in 

hiding, my two sisters and my cousin were pla
ced in an orphanage which, of course, was 

Catholic but it was not working out for what
ever reason it was...I don't know...I didn't get 

involved in these things, so they were in an 
orphanage for a while and then came home and the 
reason I went  into become a ma id and they tried 
with my little sister  is for what exactly what 
happened is so you wouldn't be together if anyt
hing happened, and there was...I reme mber a ma n 
who worked in cutting the woods behind us who 
wanted to take my little cousin.  My mother 

was afraid to let him go.  She was afraid  some thing would happen to him and nothing to us, so 

he was taken with my parents.  My par...uh they
 were arrested May 5 at five o'clock in the 
morning by the Gestapo and we had (cough)...we have 
a citadel (ph) and it's  like in the suburb of 
Liege that was unoccupied but the Ge rmans occupi
ed it and they gathered the Jews from Liege 
there and they stayed there until 
May, May 12th and then they were 
sent on to Maline (ph) which 
is a city between Brussels and An
twerp where they gathered the Je
ws fr om Belgium.  While they 
were in the citadel with some
 packages, with whatever food and clothing or whatever was 
needed into the citadel and Rochelle (ph) w
ho's the only one who survived told me  that a 
German gave her milk through the bars every si
ngle day.  There were some  Germans who were 
helping people escape, get out of the citadel beca
use the citadel also hol..
.held Belgium civilians 
who did underground for uh underground sabotage and 
my father tried to pay, because it was 
done for mo ney, to have my mother and the chil
dren taken out of there but the Germans who 
were doing it were caught and were killed by the Ge
rmans, so that...yes...this 
is, this is for real.  
They were Germans.  You have to realize not al
l Germans were Gestapos.  Not all Germans were 
Nazis.  There were Germans who helped.  Whethe
r they did it for money or because they cared I 

don't know, but I know my father had found out th
at it could be done a
nd...but the Ger...these 
German sol diers who were helping, whether th
ey were uh people who did sabotage or Jews, 
were killed, were shot, you know, by their own pe
ople.  Said couldn't be done.  We  thought they 
would...this was, you have to realize, 
this is May of 1944.  D-Day was June 
6th.  The Allied troops were bombing supposedly 
the railroads but they did not dama ge the  
railroads enough to stop the trai
ns from going out, so they thought 
they would not be deported.  
Not only that, some one, some  Catholic people f
ound out when they were going out of Liege but 
they did not dare tell my father because my fa
ther went out of his mi nd, and my father tried 
everything which way he could to do some thing or 
to join them and then 
went on to Maline and I 
stayed with Monsieur Madame  LeBa re (ph)
 who they were going in between with 
correspondence.  My aunt and uncle had lived th
ere and then went to France when Jews went 
into hiding.  Jewelry which was not jewelry with
 diamonds.  There were 
gold so you could sell it 
to buy food, were brought out of the 
citadel to their homes and hande
d to us and I went to stay 
with them for just a few days but coul d not stay
 because he too, Monsieur LeBare was also in 
hiding and I went on to Brussels to
 be closer to Maline to be ab
le to send care packages and I 
stayed with a Jewish ma n who had intermarried
 a non-Jewish woma n.  In Belgium when there 
was an inter-ma rriage, they did not 

touch the Jews and I spent the last few monthsof the war in Brussels, when I say in hiding...I 

walked the streets.  I went to the library and r
ead books.  As a ma tter of fact I had surgery.  I had 
my appendix out and I went into a Catholic 
hospital and I reme mber the Allied troops were 
bombing at the time, getting ready for D-Day, 
and I went in.  I reme mber wearing a blue

nightgown and being on the elevator
 and Madame Freedma n said to me , she said you have to be 
careful, you know, when you go under
...these these were ether, you know...they put the ma sk on 
you.  She says some  people when they go under an
esthetic, they talk and I went and I had my 
appendix out and the bombs were flying all over and I reme mber waking up and I can see the 
Virgin Mary on the ceiling and I 
kept saying in Fr ench, there's 
some thing I can't talk about.  
There's something I can't  talk about.  And I happe
ned to be in a room with people who did not 
speak French.  You know Belgium i s bilingual. 
 They spoke Flemish.  They spoke...the y didn't 
speak French, and I stayed there...you know, those we
re the days they kept
 you in the hospital for 
two weeks, and that's  when D-Day had happened 
and the Allied troops came  into Brussels in 

September and my father managed to get himsel
f in jail, in a in a prison, Be lgium prison, 
because...I don't know how he ma naged it but he sa
id he used to go to help the the underground 
to fight.  He used to go to the farmers and 
quote, rob them, to feed the underground people.  
Some how or  other...I don't know wh
at he did...he got himself in ja
il, got himself a lawyer, and I 
went to the lawyer.  I said you have my father 
released, I'll kill you.  My father was in jail...I 
don't think he ever forgave me  for it...the last th
ree months of the war an
d I left Brussels and I 
decided to go home  for to be home with my 
father for my 18th birthday, and my birthday's 

September 14.  Got on a train, got as far as _____ 
which is halfway between Brussels and Liege 
and didn't realize because Brussels they just wa
lked in...the Br itish and the Canadians came in, 
and didn't realize they we re still fighting on the 
outskirts of Liege, because it's the closest place 
to Germany.  We had it when the Germans ca me 
in in reverse, and I stayed with Monsieur, 
Madame  Le Bare and got my father out of jail some
how.  He was an alien.  They were going to 
send him to Czechoslovakia, but everything was prove
n and I went to live with my father.  We  
ma naged...we were bombed.  We  had the buzz bo mbs.  
A place to live was hard to get, so I went 
back with my father and people started comi ng 
out of the camps and comi ng home  and we were 
hoping and some man and I don't remember his name
...a Jew...came ca me  out of the camp.  My 
father was going to palm readers, to fortune tell
ers, everything, and this ma n told my  father, don't 
keep hoping.  I took the bodies out 
myself from the crematories.  
You have to realize that they 
went out when Hitler had the fi nal...came up with the fi nal solution and they went into 

Auschwitz on May 21 according to Rochelle.  They left uh Belgium 19.  Arrived on the 21 and 

they separated wome n and children and Rochelle
's husband went on a march.  Didn't ma ke it.  
That's what she told me , and when they went
 in, some body told her to hand the baby to my 
mother, and afterwards they told
 her she would never se
e the child.  My mother was lost because 
my cousin was ten.  My little si ster was...l
et's see...I was going on eighteen, so my littler 
sister...six...eighteen...fourteen...I wa
s told that my mi ddle sister 
was given the option of either 
going to the women's camp or stayin
g with my mother, and she choos
e to stay with mother.  You 
have to realize they didn't know about the gas ch
ambers, and they went in imme diately.  They 
did...were not choosed for experime nts, and this
 was the final solution and they went in 
immediately.  I didn't have the heart to ask Rochelle
 did they go in right away or the next day or 
anything, but that was the final solution and this
 ma n told him, he says don't...you know, that's 
what some  of the people did is keep the bodies, so
 uh and then we ma de contact with my aunt in 
Cleveland and my father thought I would be better o
ff comi ng to the States.  And I left my father 
and came to Cleveland, and that's it. 

 

Question:  And that's it.

Answer:  I think so.  But we had...the Catholic
s...you have to realize the the people who would 
have been caught for ma king the false ID's wererisking their lives if 
they had been caught, you 
know, doing it.  Uh if you care to kn
ow, the reason the family was picked up is we had what they 
called the ____ and they were the people...I don't 
know if you can really ca
ll them pro-Germans.  
Probably most people worked for the Germans, a
nd we had sabotage very very strong in Liege 
because of the ammunition...first 
of all because they hated the 
Germans...ammunition, rifles and 
I reme mber distinctly when an American pl an
e was shot down and fell between two stacks of 
hay across from the house where we were in hidi
ng, and we walked over.  No bodies were found 
because pr obably the underground pi cked up...I don't know i f it was one fli...pilot and the co-
pilot.  I have no idea.  Nobody found anything an
d these people were helped.  You also had a 
Briti...you know, you had the Belgian undergrou
nd and I don't  know if there was some 
infiltration comi ng from England or what a
nd when my under s tanding was that if the ____ 
turned in like an underground or...t
hey got paid for this.  This
 was...that's my understanding.  
They did it for money.  My...the family and the 
other couple were arrested on a Sunday.  There 
were things...there were pe
ople arrested...I mean the Germans were doing a lot of...nobody knew 
who was doing what.  On Thursday there were tw
in brothers...they were far mers across the way 
from where we were in hiding, who had been called
 to go to German, you see, and they didn't go.  
This was...and we'r e talking Catholics.  They 
were picked up and I don't know if they also 
worked for the underground ma ybe to what extent...I don't know.  They were picked up on 

Thursday, and whoever was doing it 

slipped...I don't know how but 
they found out who did it and 
the person who was doing it was 
killed, you know, was shot down for what he wa
s doing, but with all the things that went on, 

my...our fa mily was picked up.  The two brothers, th
e twin brothers were picked up and then that 

one person...whether it was one...I know it was one
.  Whether he worked in conjunctions with 
others I couldn't tell you because I was not at ho
me ...was wa s shot down because of what he was 
doing. 
 
Question:  Di d you see this happen? 

 

Answer:  No.  No, no.  I did not see it happen.  
You have to realize I was in Liege and I was 
running for my life too, especia
lly at that time because the 
fam...you know, my parents were 
deported and I...for some reason th
e Gestapo did not believe my little
 sister.  They did not go to 
the hospital so far as I know.  My par...my father
 left the hospital right 
away that same  Sunday 
and uh Madame  _____, her son the doctor thought it w
ould be better if I left, so because they 
were in trouble if they would have caught them w
ith a Jew.  Of course they could have denied 
knowing that I was Jewish because I was ther
e as a as a ma id.  That was...you know, but it 

still...they could have been picked up and put in 
the citadel for torture and to ma ke them talk, and 
I was prepared to go to Maline, uh to Brussels to 
be able to forward packages to the fa mily, but 
they were only there for seven days and then depo
rted, so...but this all ca
me back from from the 
far mers, you know, who lived in the count
ry.  I mean this is all true.  
 

Question:  When you were in Li ege, what were
 you aware of in terms of what was going on?   
 

Answer:  When I was in Liege...just held my
 breathe if the Ge rmans...I reme mber the uh 
Madame  ____ sent me  to the dry cleaner.  We
 had a river which is the ma in river which 
separated Liege from goi ng towards France or 
from Ger many.  The bridge, the bridges were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
10 
 
dynamited even before the German invaded.  They had ju...they had dynamited one of the 
bridges and when it was acts of sabotage, the 
Germans posted themselves on each side, and I 
reme mber picking up some  dry cleaning and some
thing had happened and they stopped me  and 

they were...and I never never...I studied German 
a l so and I spoke Yiddish fluently...never opened 
my mouth when a Germa n...I didn't want to let 
anything go.  We were aw
are...we knew we were 
in hiding.  It...it...it's hard to explain because I 
reme mber my mother used to say if we can only 
live to to tell about it, to talk 
about it.  Even though I was goin
g...I was just about sixteen when 
we went into hiding, you know, we 're not the child
ren of today.  We  didn't have television.  We  
we were not world...wise like the ch
ildren are today.  My parents we
re fantastic parents in trying 
to protect us, took the brunt of it.  We were aware.
  We  told my little cousin if you ever want to 
see your father, you mu st not...your name  is Si mone
 Albert and nothing el
se, but I was a blond.  
The...I think the the help of of the farmers, the 
help of the people...we went on living.  We ate.  
My health was fantastic.  We  did go, for instance, 
in between...someone told us about a priest in 
another village in the ____ which is
 the...he was hiding a Jewish fam
ily.  As a matter of fact this 
young woman, this Rochelle who is in Israel now...he
r sister and her mother were there in that 
village that he was willing to help and I reme
mb er my mothe r  and my two sisters...maybe my 
little cousin went...no, I think my mother and my
 sister...we got on the train and we went uh 
towards Mame ur (ph) it was called and we went a
nd we stayed at the priest's  house and he was 
going to decide whether to let my sister or me
 or both of us stay and after we got off t he 
train...(laughter)......alright and we, and he...it wa sinteresting because he was helping Jews but 

on the other hand, he worked both en
ds at one time , and I want to say this very openly.  I am not 
prejudiced.  Catholics helped us to
 save, risked their lives to save
 our lives, but there's always a 
bad one, and this priest worked both ends.  As 
a ma tter of fac t , I think the underground took care 
of hi m eventually, if I reme mber 
correctly and we  didn't stay.  We  went back, so we were aware 
but until you saw, until you saw the Germans...y
ou know, it's like every day living.  We learned 
to live with no water.  We...my father ma de us 
play cards every night.  We burned a kerosene 
lamp and that was...I reme mber we used to gripe 
but we played cards.  Th
ere was nothing else to 
do.  We  played cards.  But we went to the farmer
s.  We  went to the movies. We  we wa lked... 
 

Question:  Is this in Li ege? 

 

Answer:  No, when we were in hiding in the country. 

 

Question:  I've gotten confus
ed now with the sequence. 
 

Answer:  Well, even when we were hiding, even wh
en I was in Liege, when I was in Brussels, I 
walked the street.  I walked the streets openly.  
If I would have been st
opped for any reason...first 
of all I was a girl.  I was...I was not in areas
 where sabotage went on or Germans we nt, so I 
walked...I walked the street like any other civi
lian, and in Brussels we didn't have...with Liege 
you had the river to cross, you see.  In Liege you ha
d to be careful because if any act of sabotage 
went on, because there wa s a lot there, the Germans posted themselves on each side  of the bridge 

and you had to keep your fingers crossed you didn
't  look suspicious that they'd put you...picked 
you up, put you in the citadel for questioning. 

 

Question:  Were you ever 
accosted by Nazis at all? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
11 
 
Answer:  No.  What I reme mber before we we
nt into hiding, you know, we had to have black 
drapes, no lights, and that was before we went 
into hiding, and I can see, I can hear the boots 
comi ng up the stairway, and the Gestapo came becau
se they thought they saw light.  The drapes 
were actually opaque black.  You could not see 
a white drape with light
 because that meant 
signaling, you know, whatever, and to this day wh
en I when I see boots...I mean I can see the 
German, but  that was before we went into 
hiding.  The only instance I reme mber even though 
that was not allowed is...I'm talking German sol dier...I don't know...there were two, three 
walking together and we were walking with my 
mother.  It was my sister and they stopped my 
mother for just a few mi nutes about some thi
ng that was a no-no, and they let her go, but 
otherwise, other than the ordinary sabotage 
went on or anything th
at they stopped everybody, 
especially on either side of the river.  No, Iwas never stopped. 

 

Question:  Di d they search people, search your bicycle or search... 

 

Answer:  Yes.  See they looked to see on the dry 
cleaning, yes.  Physically
 I was never searched.  
What, what they did is if they suspected some one
, they picked them up, took them to the citadel 
and I'm talking not necessarily Jews.  I'm talk
ing citizens.  Took them, let's say the the the 
underground went and picked up ammunition.  An
 hour later the real German ones _____, so 
they posted themselves and they search especially
 by the river and they would arrest...they would 
ta...and it was ma inly men.  They would take them 
to the citadel.  At first what they did is 
they...you had turned in...you had to realize that the 
identification card are almost like passport.  
They are very very official, pict
ure and everything.  They would 
they would keep the identi...the 
ID's  and say come  back and get them, but the pe
ople never went back to get them, so they got 
wise, you see, and they would hold whoever they 
had and I heard, I remember hearing of people 
being tortured to the extent I reme mber one 
inst ance of uh very clearly that some body committed 
suicide.  I reme mber it being said.   I neve
r saw anyone, I had no contact with anyone who was 
released from the citadel, but I reme mber it be
ing said if they talk, don't blame the m because 
they were being tortured.  So what was happe
ning, for instance, if 
a man who...reme mber the 
wome n didn't work in those days.  Wome n stayed 
at home.  If me n went out to work and they 
were due home  at five o'clock and word I mean 
spread like wildfire.  You knew when there was 
sabotage right after it happened.  You knew what wa
s going on at all time s.  If a ma n, if there 
was...somet hing had  happened and your husband 
or your father didn't come  home at five 
o'clock, starting from five o'clock until he got 
home  fifteen minutesla
te, you trembled.  You 
waited and you hoped they hadn't been picked up.  
But that wa s not to the Jews.  That was to 
every Belgian citizen because of the very high ra
te of sabotage that was 
going in Liege.  Now 
you have to realize that the French Belgiums ha
ted the Germans.  We'r
e not talking about the 
Flemish.  We were orthodox, but it wa s not th
e orthodox that are known in Antwerp.  I mean, 
you know, my father did not wear a yarmulke (ph)
.  I understand my mother was ma rried with a 
shidle (ph), but of course did 
not live that way.  The synagogue 
was orthodox.   We  didn't have a 
rabbi.  He went to Russia for a visit and was 
caught during the war.  The Belgian Jews except 
ma ybe for Antwerp...we're talking Liege...people my generation and older, were immi grants.  

They came ma inly from Poland to work the coal 
mi ning countries and then went into businesses, 
tailors, furriers, me rchants, and they worked 
their way out.  Belgium is a modern country, uh 
very open, and you could get yourself financially quite
 comf ortable, even as a Jew.  As an alien 
you had to register.  It was...all aliens.  There were Italians and then after the Sp...during the 

Spanish Revolution we pi cked up not ma ny Spanish because they went ma inly to France, so you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
12 
 
had aliens but not Jews.  Now I a m talking the Fren
ch part of Belgium.  I am not versed of what 
went on in Antwerp, but the Flemish Belgium ma y 
be a little, may have been a little more pro-
German than the French Belgium.  The Belgium,  the ____ hate the 

Germans, reme mbered World Wa r I.  They did 
not...the the the...when I say uneducated, we all 
went to school until like age 12.  Everybody we
nt to school.  Were not cosmopolitan.  They 
didn't know of a Jew.  I never was pointed out, 
made to feel different.  I I reme mber going to 
school with ma tzos.  Wh en we went into hidi
ng, when we had to go, we had a neighbor and I 
don't even reme mber the name .  She  said where are 
we going, so my mother told him we have to 
leave.  We  have...because we'r e Jews and they looked at us.  They didn't even know what a 

Jew...they couldn't believe we were Jewish, you s
ee, because even though we kept Judaism at 
home...my mother lit candles...the 
neighbor next door, the Ca tholic, 
was not aware of it all or we 
didn't speak about it in school.  There was not the 
exchange that children 
have today.  This is 
why St. Nicholas day, Ea ster e
gg hunt, uh the the children have 
communion.  My sister who was 
much more outgoing than I was, went to partie
s for communi on.  We  had rosaries at home , holy 
pictures.  We did not carry them, but that's  wh
at we carried during wh
ile we were in hiding 
because even the very non-staunch Catholics w
ho did not follow all the rules, carved bread 
before (ph),.  They _____.  They had rosaries in th
e house.  That's  what we carried to be part of 
the Catholic, but as a Jew until we had to go into
 hiding and even while we were in hiding, if I 
can relive it...we had fear but we
 did not have fear of the Be
lgium citizen you see, like a 
whole...Question:  Your friends 
did not turn on you like they did 
in other cases.  They rema ined 
very helpful, and when you were in hiding, were
 they helpful to you? Answer:  My Monsieur 
Madame  Le Bare...I went to stay there.  I mean this was a couple who were ma ybe at that time  

ma ybe in their fifties, late forties
...you know, when you are young they look a lot 
older...Monsieur Madame LeBare I 
went to.  Uh where I was in hiding they took me  in because 
they were anti-German but they...I...I don't think they would have risked th
eir life to the extent 
that this ma n in the country did to get us papers
, to get the false identification card.  It took one 
rotten apple to kill the whole thing.  You have 
to realize that the villa
ges, everyone knew we 
were Jewish.  Everyone knew we we re hi
ding.  There was no way...nobody abandoned us when 
when my mother and my sisters were arrested
 and brought to the ma in road, and the fa rmers 
also...this came  back from a far mer that I have no
 reason to doubt them, that they tried to help in 
saving the children.  The the ordinary far mer, th
e ordinary citizen...no one turned on us.  I mean 
Madame  ____ or the doctor did not 
turn against me .  What they did 
is they didn't want to risk my  
staying there.  There was no need for it.  It wa
s too dangerous.  I could not stay with Monsieur 
Madame  Le Bare because he also was hiding beca
use he was supposed to have gone to Germany, 

you see, to work the factories.  You have to r
ealize Hitler was loosing at the Russian fronts and 
and all the Germans...t he the German citizens were in
 the army.  They needed civilians so he also 
was hiding in his own home .  They couldn't pick
 up everybody, so they were afraid...they didn't 
turn on me .  I stayed there but for their safety, fo
r my safety, we couldn't st
ay together.  We  went 
back...my father and I got on a bus.  We went back 
to the farm.  They spoke to us.  They could 
have turned us in.  You see, we went to
 get information...what happened, what...but nobody 
turned us in.  I...we left, we left the farm.  
Nobody turned us in, but 
it took what they called 
_____ who worked for the Germans whether I feel
, whether they were ignorant or there are 
always people who go on the winning side to prot
ect themselves or whether they did for money I 
don't know, so it took one person to 
do it, but as a whole, no...no one.  
I went back to the farm.  I 
went to Monsieur Madame  Le Bare, and no one said you mus t  be...you know, it was worked out 

so that I was safe, and I was ab
le to get on a train and go to Br
ussels.  Nobody threw me  out.  We 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
13 
 
were on a bus.  Farmers...we got the story.  They
 could have called, they
 could have called the 
Germans.  They could have called the Gestapos. 
 They could have the ___ Germans and had my 
father and I arrested.  We survived through the e
nd of the war.  If it wouldn't have been for the 
Belgium citizens, for the Catholics, we could have 
never ma de it.  Not only they helped, but they 
did risk their lives.  I me an if 
they would have been caught, uh... 
 
Question:  We have to pause there. 

 

END OF T APE 1  

 

Answer:  We knew we were...when I walked the 
streets when I went on errands, even when I 
went home on weekends as a ma id, when I was 
working as a ma id, during...I don't reme mber...it 

took me  a half an hour, forty-five minutes on my 
bicycle...I had no fear dur
ing that period.  Uh I 
also had an incident that happe
ned.  We live in...it's hilly.  The trucks di d not run on gasoline...it 
was butane, whatever they run...and it was common 
practice to hook up to the truck in the back 
and go up the hill.  My skirt caught on to the tr
uck and I fell and I broke my collar bone.  I can 
prove it.  And I reme mbe r  there was a ma n sitting 
in the open truck in the 
back and they picked 
me  up and put my bicycle on and I said don't let me  die three days before my birthday.  It was 

September 11.  That's how I reme mb er the date. 
 The fear was not a c
onstant fear, you know, on 
the everyday living.  Sure we knew like before I went
 in to be a ma id and the family sat together 
and we talked and we had to play cards with 
my father...we griped, I mean like any ordinary 
teenager. 

 

Question:  And your father was present... 

 

Answer:  We were all together...the the fa mily 
except for the brief period where my t wo sisters 
and my cous in went into an orphanage which...I
 don't re me mb er how long they stayed, whether 
they stayed a month, two months, and then thenuns said my sister...my sister was too old to 

really be considered uh an orphan.  Uh the 
the food was not as...it sounds it sounds crazy...the 
food was not as good as at home.  Re me mber, we 
ate fresh vegetables, fresh foods, cream.  My 
my...I I was much heav....I was heavier than I have
 ever been and we lived as a family.  We   
burned wood.  I mean...we we we
...on most everyday thing, no.  
A ma n came to cut the woods 
behind.  They befriended us.   They offered to take my cousin... 

 

Question:  I'm still just a little bit confused.  Y
ou were living as a family with a family, and yet 
you're working as a ma id? 

 

Answer:  No.  The the whole...up until about...I don't know how long I was a ma id...three 

months, four months...the whole 
family was together until this person came and told my parents 
about my going in to become  a ma id so as to be
 separated from the fa mily.  We  were in hiding 
when I had to fill out papers and I ha d to go back to to the village, to _____...in hiding for 

twenty-two months.  I was a ma id for only several months, so the first part of the hiding, two 

fa milies were together, completely together. Fo
r a short period, my si
sters and my cousin...but 
that was much later until you you get your bearings, until...and I don't remember at which point  

of hiding they went to the orphanage.  I wa
s too old.  There wa s no two ways...we lived two 
fa milies toge ther in a little...I'm telling you, a sma
ll house in three rooms upstairs.  We can't  even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
14 
 
call them bedrooms...we  turned them into bedroo
ms  and two rooms downstairs, so we were two 
fa milies together and my father went  to help th
e fa rmers.  Uh we rode our bicycles.  We  we 
didn't work.  Uh we didn't know...you know, you had to take  it on a day-to-day basis because we 
didn't know how long we were going to be in hidi
ng.  We  left the house with no fear.  We  rode 
our bicycles to the next village with no fear.  
We  went to to the farmers to pick up eggs or 

whatever we needed with no fear.  My sister a
nd I went in to Liege fo
r our ration stamps.  How 
did I feel?   I think on the way down there was not th
at fear because we didn't have to fear every 
every citizen, you know, we passed, or or truck or ev
ery farmer.  When we went to to the station 
where they handed out the ration uh stamps, to 
give you the instance when the Germans were 
looking for I don't know what and the people w
ho were distributing them a ccording to 
___..._______________card with the Juda stamped on it, so 
they protected us.  I am sure we 
didn't realize, at least we, me as a teenager, rea
lized the full extent of what was happening.  I was 
aware...I didn't  understand Kristallnacht, fo
r instance, until many years later and you see 

pictures.  I knew it was there.  I reme mber 
when the Germans invaded Poland before...you know, 
we were going tracing back.  My...we had balconies.
  You know, this is European style.  There 
were balconies, and I reme mber...it was a beautif
ul sunshiny day.  My mother was crying, and I 
couldn't understand, but my mother reme mbered Wo
rld War I, you see.  I reme mber we left 
Liege because everybody yelled they'r e dyna miting the br idges, they'r e dyna...and we lived in the 

part of Liege we could only go to Germany, so we 
went to friends on the other side of the city.  
My father and the other ma n took off to see wh
at if they could ____ the troops, even though we 

were aliens, and we went, my mother, Madame
 Bi lkowitz (ph)...they di
dn't have children...my 
two sisters and we went...I've seen movies of it, 
and what happened is in Belgium is the civilians 
were caught with the soldiers and the planes ca
me and were shooting low 
and killing civilians, 
and we were ma rching with a few belongings, an
d people were turning around.  They said don't 
keep going.  They'r e shooting at the troops so the 
civilians are getting kill
ed, so we stopped and 
we went and I reme mber we stayed...we slept on 
the floor with everybody packed in in what was 
built for soldiers to to stay.  I reme mber tryi ng to make tea with cold water because there was no 

cold water and we decide d to turn around because
 the people who were trying to go to Fra...to 
France were comi ng back and saying the Germ
ans are...with the machine guns, you know, were 
giving the planes low and shooting, and I saw th
e first Germans as we were going back.  We  
didn't know where my father and Monsieur Berk
owitz were, and I saw the first German.  We  
were not home  yet and I could see them on a motorc
ycle with side car and with the guns and we 
held on to my mother and Madame  Berkowitz.  We
 went back to Liege and my father and Mr. 

Berkowitz came  back.  There's nothing to...and we
 went back home .  An
d during the first two 
years, everything we had to eat was black ma rk
et.  I never went hungry.  When it came to going 
to hiding, sure we were afraid
 but we didn't know about the 
concentrationcamps.  We did 
not...we knew about the ____ but I as a teenager, I 
think my parents entwined to shield us.  

Today we tell our children.  And we tell them the 
world is not all roses, but children we re not 
brought up that way, so they shielded us so...I
 I I reme mber knowing...when you went went into 
Poland, I reme mber my mother crying when war 
was declared and they ta...you know, they they 
came in.  We went into hiding.  I reme mber my 
parents talking.  I can see my father walking up 
the stairway, afraid when I hea
...when I hear boots.  When I s
ee them to this day I shutter 
because I can see the Germans ma
rching with the boots and not necessarily Gestapos.  I can hear, 
I can reme mber when the the this Gestapo stopp
ed because they thought they saw a light comi ng 
out of our windows.  But we were not afraid
 of the everyday sold
ier you see, who...and we, 
where we lived we prob...we mi ght have had mo re th
an let's say Brussels, b
ecause we were at the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

German bor der, and there was what we call ______ 
where they train soldiers, you see, and they 
occupied it.  The Americans occ
upied it in reverse when they lib
erated us.  The hiding...yes, we 
knew but maybe some  of it over forty years kind 
of...but I reme mber we went into the woods to 
sleep because the Ger...the the farmers came and 
said, you know, the Germans are searching for I 
don't know what, but going into the city, comi
ng back...until the Germans stopped us at the 
bridge and I mean I trembled, 
but I don't think I comprehended 
even what was happening in the 
citadel when people came out and said they'r e to
rturing, because as a fifteen year old girl, you 
know, you don't...unless unless you live through an e
xperience, you cannot feel what some one 
else has, but I reme mber...I was in Brussels...when 
I went to Brussels when my mother was taken 
from the citadel in Liege to Maline, and I wa
s getting ready to senda package, and Madame  
Freedma n said to me , Frida...I don't know how she found out...she says you can't send a package.  
They've been deported.  And why I cried a
nd why...I felt hurt.  You know, I'm trying to 
reme mber, but I must have known that it was so
mething terrible, and I reme mber she made me 
go to the movie and I was...so I came...their s
on who was younger, and I did not want to go, and 
she says you have to go because she felt it was be
tter for me but I remember cryi ng.  I reme mber 
feeling terrible that they were deported, you 
see.  But whether I understood...we didn't know 
about the the gas chambers.  Nobody knew.  But wh
ether...I don't think I wa
s scared.  I was so...I 
reme mber crying.  I reme mber not wanting to go to the movie, you see.  I know when I went into 

the hospital for appendicitis, I 
I was afraid to di vulge my real name, you see, but... 
 

Question:  Because it was Jewish? 

 

Answer:  Yes.  First of all I would have divulge
d I was in hiding, you see.  I had another name .  I 
must have been afraid enough, but not when 
I walked the streets 
because everybody...you know, 
the ordinary civilian walked the street, and only...
and in Brussels I did not quite have the fear 
because Br...Liege was much more dangerous 
sabotage-wise, you see.  There was a lot more 
going on in Liege.  My father while in hi
ding...we knew about the underground, you see.  Once I 
went to Brussels I was detached from that, and 
I don't think I feared for my  life during the last 
three months of the war. 

 

Question:  Le t's just pick up and trace again...I k
now we 've been through it be
fore, but just a little 
bit more slowly...you're in hiding.  You're living w
ith the two fa milies.  And what happens next?   
 

Answer:   What happened next?   We
 grew the vegetable.  We  we we went to fetch water.  We  
cooked everything the hard way.  You know, you have
 to reme mber we did laundry on the scrub 
board.  Not only we didn't  have water, we had to
 go get the water.  We  had...the the when they 

used to cut the trees, they used to leave pieces of
 wood so we gathered wood to burn in the stove.  
We did not burn coal.  Our days we
re busy from morning till night. 
 

Question:  What was your next phase, after th
e two fa milies?   You didn't stay as the two 
fa milies?   

 

Answer:  No.  I went into Liege to
 become  a ma id.  My sister very
 shortly after went to the next 
or the same village to a doctor in
 the village to become  a ma i d, but she was ill.  She did not feel 
well, and the doctor told her to go 
home  to to recuperate, so  I was in Liege as a ma id.  We nt 
home  every other weekend on my bicycle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

Question:  So your fa mily rema ined a unit... 

 

Answer:  The fa mily remained as...the two fa milies
 rema ined as a unit.  This is why when the 
Gestapo came...except except my father.  My fa
ther went, came to Lieg
e and went in...we had 
one big hospital.  He went to the hospital on Friday.  But this is what fa milies tried to do is not to 

stay together.  This is why my 
sisters went into an orphanage... 

 

Question:  A Catholic home ...? Answer:  Yeah.  Well, they'r e all Catholic.  We ...I assume  

everybody knows...went to a Cathol
ic orphanage to try to sepa
rate...you we re not in a cluster 
when this happened, which is exactly what happened you see.  Uh a lot of fa milies...tha t's what 

they tried to do...save the children, to se
parate the children 
from the adults. 
 

Question:  Do you reme mber the day that it happened? 

 

Answer:  When they were arrested?    May 5, 
1944, five o'clock in the morning.  The Gestapo 
came to pick up the family, and reme mber this...on March...March  5, excuse me .  March 5 at 

five o'clock in the morning, and you have to 
remember the weather...w
ee hours in the morning 
and it's dark, and they took them from the house 
to the ma in road to question them and my 
mother tried to save the children by telling them
 that they were not her children.  But the 
Germans di d not take it, and the farmers tried.  
I don't know to what extent, and the Germans di d 
not take it and I guess no one asked for me .  
Wh oever reported us didn't realize that I was 
mi ssing but they did ask where my father was and 
my little sist er said my father was in the 
hospital and the German slapped her for lying.  In
 this case the farmers who did not specifically 
do some thing physical for us like making the pa
pers or some thing, but they knew we were 
Jewish.  We  had food.  We had eggs.  We  had mil
k.  We  had everything we wanted.  My father 
worked for it, but uh nobody paid for us you see.
  I mean there was no exchanges, you know, 
wherever...I don't know where we got the meat.  
I reme mber a ham, a s moked ham, and my 
mother never touched it.  I mean my mother 
could not get away from the kosher laws even 
though the meat she ate was not kosher.  The farm
ers were there to notify us.  Why they didn't 
know...they came at five o'clock in the morning.  If they would have known I can assure you we 

would have been warned, but this was March 
5.  Reme mber D-Day was June 6th.  The Allied 
troops were getting ready for D-Day.  There 
was heavy bombing.  Hitler was fighting on the 
Russian front where all the Ger...they needed th
e soldiers on the Russian front, so you had the 
Catholic citizen, the Belgium citizen, in hiding 
because they didn't want to go to work in 
Germany, a nd it's hard to comprehend.  How do
 you hide in your own house, but everybody was 
hiding, and as a whole, whoever ha
d to send the letters out to say yes we have to go to the train 
station and you have to report because you have 
to go to Germany, these people were against the 
Germans too, so if you had _____ where where...I don'
t know what the percentage was, but there 
were not ma ny.  All you needed is one or two an
d they had to be caref
ul that the underground 
didn't kill them because the Catholics were Germ
an-haters enough to do it because I know they 
did it whoever caught.  As a ma tte
r of fact, when the Jews came  back fr om the camps, Belgium 
Jews in Liege did not own property, did not
 own houses.  For some  reason there was a 
couple...and we were not friends of theirs...owne
d a house.  The fa mily, a boy, girl, mother and 
father, were deported.  The girl and the boy cam
e  back.  They were around my age...I don't 
reme mber...they were one of the first ones to come  back from the camp.  The _____ had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
17 
 
occupied their house.  Do you know what happened when they came back?   People went in and 
had a bonfire throwing them out of 
t he house, you see.  So the fear we had was the fear of being 
caught and being caught in a cluster, which had 
happ...which happened.  You see, if my sister 
hadn't been sick, she too would have survived.  Uh
 we were also afraid of another Jew because 

you...the list, the name s of the Jews and I'm talking 
strictly Liege, that it
 got out, was handed out, 
was prepared by a Jewish fa mily.  They ended up
 in hiding.  As a ma tter of fact, they had two 
daughters, one my age a nd one a little bit olde
r.  They ended up in 
hiding and you know, people 
under certain circumstances do cert
ain things to save their life.  I think it's well known that 
certain people did things in the ca
mp s, that it went on at top levels 
in tryi ng to save thei r lives.  
This not unknown.  It's  not uh surfaced as much as what we went though, but there was a Jewish 

couple...I can't think of their name .  Only the da
ughter's name I reme mber.  After the war, they 
were shunned.  The older daughter
 ended up going with an Amer
ican who was not Jewish...he 
was Protestant...someplace in Tennessee or some
thing.  She was pregnant  before she was 
ma rried.  Now we 'r e going back to the days when 
when this happened it wa
s the worst thing that  
could happen.  Everybody says he deserves it.  So
 you were also concerned of what another Jew 
mi ght do in order to save his...I think when 
everybody went into hiding, every one realized no 
one could save themselves no ma tter what they 
did, so this this ma n who who who did this, 
ended up in hiding like everybody else, but he wa s...t
hey were separated fr om the girls.  The girls 
ended up in a Catholic home .  What you also had...my parents, my mother was a very good 

person, very soft-hearted, and this is how this
 couple, Rochelle and her husband and the baby, 
came in hiding with us, because we wanted to help
 them but it would have been much smarter if 
we didn't, if...we should have been more selfish 
so you didn't have as large a cluster of people 
together, but my parents knew her when she 
was what, fifteen, sixt
een, and he was from 
Czechoslovakia.  They knew him as a youngster, so
 they did for them and we went in together, 
but as a whole, Jews did not...I
 think my father ran into th
e man who had given out the list 
because you know you walked the street, you went in
to the city, and he  knew the two girls were 
in a Catholic home  and he wouldn't tell my fath
er where because he didn't want...you see, he was 
smart in a way.  He didn't want other Jews 
to find out because the more you had, the more 
dangerous it was for them.  So the idea was to do
 the best you could for yourself, but not do for 
another one, not to be caught in a cluster, but 
we were in a cluster no ma tter how we tried.  And 
uh Rochelle and...they came ...I don't
 know how much later.  It wa
s it was not a month because 
after the the teenagers we re, you know, had to go 
out and no one, no one that I know of in that 
group came back.  This was right at
 the beginning.  They came ...it mi
ght have been a week later, 
ten days later, that  they called them in, so they came and joined us and we were two families 

together which was not good so what happenswhen the Gestapo came, everybody was together.  

Why Rochelle and her husband never tried to
 go some place else...I guess we felt very well-
protected because there was no anti-Se mitism.  N
obody turned in anyone you see.  No one turned 
in anyone, except the ____ because they were underground pe ople that we re being picked up and 

they were trying to find out who was doing it.
  Sure they found out.  Sunday...my fa mily. 
Thursday the twin brothers who were supposed 
to have gone up to Germa ny.  Not only that, I 
think they were working with the underground, an
d then that...when it was found out that there 
were things going on uh before and they were tr
ying to find out who was selling out, what was 
going...I don't   know. 

 

Question:  What happened to 
you when you found out that your mo
ther had been deported?   
What were you doing and what did you do then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242

Answer:  I was in Brussels, and Madame  Friedman, 
when I went to get ready to ma ke, wanted to 
get a package ready to send to 
Maline, Madame  Friedman told me , no...they've been deported.  I 
went to pieces.  I was crying.  I didn't want want 
to believe it.  And she told me  to...she arranged 
for me  to go to the movie with her with her son, 
which I didn't  want to go.  And she says the...I 
must go and I don't reme mber which movie I saw.  I know it wasn't  an American mo vie.  They 

didn't allow it.  And I think that 
the last three months I must have lived on a...first of all my 
father was in jail.  I was separated fro m my 
fa ther and we knew that the Allied troops were 

getting ready to land.  Re me mber, this is May, 
and my fa mily went out uh May 19 you see.  D-

Day was June 6th, so while they were at the 
citadel, I was busy ma king arrangeme nts to send 
packages.  We made arrangements to get letter
s in, packages meaning if you read one of the 

letters that was sent out of the citadel, they
'r e asking for canned meat, anything that can be 
preserved.  They'r e asking for shoes.  She's 
asking for for candy...we call them bon bons...for the 

for the child.  Uh she's a sking for thread.  She's asking for a bra.  So during...from March 5 to 

May 12th was it...I was busy with that you see.  
I was with Monsieuer Madame  LeBar e  in a...oh 
no, I was not with Monsieur Madame  LeBare the w
hole time.  When I left where I was a maid, I 
don't know how...I ended up...I forgot about th
at...in the home of a law...oh, probably through 
their daughter who was ma rried to a lawyer.  I 
wa s in Liege.  I reme mber...she lived along the 
river and I ended up in the home of a lawyer, 
a single woma n who had never been ma rried. She 
smoked a pipe.  She had a boy friend.  I didn't 
expect...understand the extent
 of it.  You know, I 
was very naive.  Reme mber from the age of fi
fteen to the age of eight
een, I didn't have normal 
growing-up.  Yes.  I was in the home of a lawy
er, and I reme mber baking bread and I reme mber 
cleaning the house, but she was not...I was not th
e maid maid that I was before and I was 
arranging to ma ke packages to send to the citade
l and I was arranging to keep my father in jail, 
and she's the one I says you get my fa ther rele
ased...I'll kill you.  I was not eighteen years old, 
and I turned to the lawyer , the son- in-law of 
the home  where I was hiding who was very nice, 
you see, and he arranged when my fa ther came  up fo
r trial to keep him in jail, because my father 
was ready to surrender himself to the  Germans.  I  
forgot about that part.  I stayed with her for 
short time, so I don't think I had time to be sc
ared.  I didn't have time for anything.  I don't 
think...my fa ther had the brunt in
 trying to pay some one to get the family released from the 
citadel and when I went to Brussels, I didn't 
know about the gas chambers.  I knew they were 
deported.  I know I went to pieces
.  I...I was going on eighteen but 
it was my mother who went.  I 
reme mber crying and I reme mber saying no, I don't  want to go to the movie.  I reme mb er 

distinctly, and I lived the last
 three months...we each had, each 
of us three girls had in the 
padding of our coat my aunt in Cleveland, her na
me  and address.  She was the only relative we 
had outside of Europe except an uncle who was 
on a kibbutz in Israel.  We had her address and 

two hundred American dollars.  Remember, this is 
black ma rket, so that if we got separated the 
two hundred dollars helped me  survive financ
ially.   Re me mb er no body had money.  No body 
had a lot.  Monsieur Friedman...w
e won't go into this character. He was a character.  Took the 
two hundred dollars and sold them
 to an American, sold to a German sol dier when...reme mber 
the Germans were walk...I mean clean.  Nothing, 
not a pin was out of line when they walked.  
When the Allied troops crossed the French-Belgi
um border, the radio was saying they were 
crossing the Belgium, the French-Belgium border. 
 The news could not keep up with the Allied 
troops.  They were in Brussels.  I could see th
e Allied troops comi ng.  I ha
d been released from 
the hospital.  My appendics were...had opened an
d there was uh uh...I had an infection and there 
was no bandages and I had a gauze bandage around me , and they came and everybody was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
19 
 
kissing them.  They wanted to pick me  up a
nd I was afraid the suture was going to open 
(laughter) and the Allied troops came  in and 
I saw for the first time German soldiers...you know, 
this ____ with the jacket, and I reme mber one 
distinctly.  Reme mber, I'm going on eighteen and 
I'm seventeen...dragging a horse.  They were selling, 
they were trying to get American dollars.  
They were trying to get anything they could la
y their hands on because the German ma rk, the 
Belgium mo ney was worth, was worth absolutely 
nothing, so my two hundred American dollars, 
I never saw it because he kept...he kept it.  We  s o
ld to uh German soldiers on the black ma rket.  
It would have brought in a fortune
 probably.  That I reme mbe r  distinctly.  I reme mber getting on 
the train and I reme mber it was dusk and and I couldn't go anywhere else, because I wanted to 

get back with my father.  Whethe
r the thought of the stat
e of my mother and sisters came  into in 
my mi nd at that time...I don't think so.  What I can 
recall distinctly is saying 
I want to be with my 
father.  I want to be home for my eighteenth birt
hday.  That I reme mber.  Whether I thought or I 
wondered what happened to my mother...at the tim
e maybe I didn't.  My ma in ai m was getting 
back with my father, which I didn't do right aw
ay because I stayed with Monsieur Ma da me  
LeBare.  When I got to ___ there wa s no transpor
tation.  I got on an American jeep.  Took me  
into Liege.  Then I worked on getting my fath
er, getting, you know, my fath
er out of jail.  He 
was an alien.  They were going to send him a
nd at the time there was already becomi ng Russia, 
that part of Czechoslovakia.  
I'm trying to think and I can't ...di
d I wonder what happened to my 
mother and sisters as the Jews 
came out of the concentration cam
ps.  I guess we were hoping to 
see them come  out, because they went out ve
ry soon before D-Day, but because see they 
deported them once more even after D-Day.  This is
 June 6th they landed.  They didn't come  into 
Belgium until September, so we called them ______.  One group of Jews went out and there was 

another one I understand went out
 after them.  So we were hoping as Jews came out of the 
concentration camps...Rochelle came out.  She does
 not reme mber...I saw her in Israel...that I 
went to see her after she came home , but she didn
't  talk about what happened.  I  reme mber her 

crying, but I went to see her because when I saw he
r in Israel about eleven years ago, I said to 
her, I said Rochelle, don't you reme mber I saw yo
u, and she said no, but I reme mber.  Cause she 
told me  at the time she was sterilized, that sh
e, you know, she was not...Mengeler sterilized her, 
because when I was in Israel...that wa s before
 they announced that Mengeler had died, whether 
it's sure enough beside the point (ph), and she 
said to me , she says I could...in French, of 
course...if I could lay my hands on Mengeler, and she 
told me  the process of 
her being sterilized.  
Today, at the time, could be reversed.  She rema rried, but she cannot ha
ve children.  She could 
not, you know, she could not have children.  And what
 I reme mber at liberation is when the Jews 
came back, this whole thing...we were hoping my  mo
ther would come  back, you see.  And then 
at first, you know, they were released quite easily
 and then they were detained to rebuild their 
health and, you know, they were cleaned up and that
's  when they straggle in and some body told 
my father, you know, people survived and it was a 
Belgium fr om Liege, who had been deported 
earlier...I don't know at which poi
nt...he said to my father, don'
t keep hoping.  I took them out 
myself out of the gas chambers.  And my aunt 
by ma rriage who is the only one left in Belgium 
now, when I went back she ma de me  aware, and th
is has always been hard for me  to swallow, 
but this was the time  when he ran out of gas, 
and the people were not completely dead before 

they went into the the ovens, a
nd that has been a very, very hard thing for me .  At first I told 
myself, oh they weren't tortured.  They were not 
used for experime nts, and I thought of them of 
going into the gas chambers a
nd being killed right away, youknow.  They put peo...prisoners 
and they el ec trocut e them, and I guess this is what I wanted to believe  is they went in, until 

Rochelle just sent me  her letter and said they
 were in very bad...you know, they were on trains, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0242  
20 
 
you know, for two days from the 19th to the 21st. 
 I lived with that be
cause I ma de myself 
believe that they went in...they we
nt into the gas chambers and we
nt out right away, but that is 
not so because they were not...that's when people did not go out completely because he was 
exterminating too fast and there 
was not enough gas before they put 
them in the crematories, and 
when this was pointed out to me ...I I tried to put 
in the back of my mi nd.
  Then when I came to 
the States to live with my aunt, I came in May 
and in the fall...I don't remember what month...we 
had high holy days and my aunt wanted to go to
 ____ for my mother and I absolutely refused 
and I said oh no.  I'...I reme mber.  I say if I go 
to ____ for my mother, I'll 
bury her.  And I did not 
want to go for that reason.  I mean it's childish. It's unrealistic, but I reme mber saying to her no.  

I'll bury my mother.  And I would not go to ____
_.  And it took me a long time I think because I 
was told that my sister had a choice of goi
ng with wom...with the wom...in the women's camp 
and to my mother.  I think to myself, you know
, she was old enough to reme mber her name .  
She...I mean I was...when she went out she was si
xteen in June, June 20 or 21st.  She was old 
en...for ma ny ma ny years after hopi
ng oh, she got lost some place on the Russian side and she 
couldn't get out and maybe someday...and this is so
mething that I must admit even to this day 
even though I know, I know, I know...there is a trace 
in me a nd I've never said this to my 
son...there's a trace in me that keeps telling me
 she's alive someplace.  (Crying) I don't know why 

and I know it isn't so...but I didn't want to bury 
my mother.  For ma ny ma ny years I did not want 
to go to ______, and I know my sister is gone, but 
I think it's some thing in you that keeps that 
little bit of hope, that
 little bit of twinge and you know, 
everybody had parents.  Everybody had 
sisters.  Everybody had brothers. 
 Now we are slowly entering an age, you know...parents have 
died off and I realize that parents do die, and I 
think this has helped me to accept...and children 
loose parents at an ea rly age because  of illness, 
and as I get older and I have very, very close 
friends in Cleveland...they'r e fa mily to me ...whos
e mother and father have died, you know, from 
age.  I think if the word accept 
is the right word, I'm learning to 
live with it because we do die, 
but at eighteen I didn't want to accept it, you see. 
  And I think it's a littl
e bit easier for me  to 
accept and it's been many years th
at my mother died, because I've seen my friends loosing their 
mother and father.  I happen to have friends whose parent s lived for a long time, you know, until 

eighty, eighty©two, and they just lost them a fe
w years ago. One of them j ust lost them two 
years ago, so it does happen, so maybe it's made it more acceptable to me  that my mot her died.  

My sisters...I don't know.  When a friend of mi ne 
died because  of illness, so I'm slowly entering 
the age, you know, illness and things.  You know, I 
had a hard time adjusting to the hi gh holy 
days, uh especially Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kip
pur...not so much Passover, but Rosh Hashanna 
and Yom Ki ppur.  There's the family tie that I 
don't  go to pieces anymore.  I haven't had any 
nightma res or screaming for my fat her and fi
re burning in a long time I don't think.  Uh it 

uh...you know, time heals.  My sister is nowhere.  I 
mean there's no two ways about it.  I cannot, 
you know, kid myself and I've accepted that my mother
 is gone, and I try not to talk about it, to 

reme mber or to to face the realit
y.  It's silly...that there was not enough gas to kill them and then 
since Rochelle wrote to me , you know, I...when I see 
movies with the trains I can't  look at them.  
I went to Yad Vashem.  I 'm always afraid to s
ee pictures.  Running away from rea...reality.  
When they have real pictures, I'm al ways afraid 
to look and to see them.  I'm a fraid to look at 
train pictures, you see.  I'm alwa
ys afraid to see my mother or
 my sisters, which is foolish 
because it's the real thing, and I can watch movi es
.  I can watch...I can talk about it.  When I see 
it, then I see them and this is...this is the pa
rt that I don't like to see is, you know, whe n they 
show those skeletal-like people.  I know this 
did not happen to my mother and sisters because 

they went to the gas chamber ri
ght away you see.  But I cannot watch the the trains.  See my

little sister was fourteen in Ma
rch, but she was very small, so
 you see the child
ren.  My little 
cousin...we were very close to him because he had 
lost his real mother and he was in our house a 
lot, but I don't think I feel the 
tie with him as mu ch as with my
 sister s, and with Rochelle, the 
little boy...I mean this kid, this th
is baby didn't sit on a chair.  I me an he had all the adults 
pampering him and spoiling him, so until I get...I 
don't think I have fully accepted that there was 
not enough ___ and they were dragged out half-aliv
e.  I don't know.  I tell myself ma ybe they 
didn't, and I cannot, and I cannot see the trains. 
 I cannot watch it.  The rest I can accept and I 
always say to the Americans, you came  two months
 too late as far as I'm concerned.  You know, 
my son is an American.  I consider myself fully
 Americanized.  All my friends are American.  I 

never affiliated with people who came from Eur
ope because Belgium is very different.  I was 
one of the first...I was not a deportee and I 
came, I landed in New York exactly...._____ year 
after D-Day. I was really fortunate that I met gi
rls my age.  Whether they felt sorry because I 
didn't speak English very well. 
 I Americanized but I always say you came  too late, two months 
too late, and they bombe d supposedly the railro
ad and they mi ssed because had the railroads 
been dama ged enough, the trains couldn't have gone
 out you see.  So I had...oh is it resentme nt, 
towards the Allied troops.  You know, I'm an adult 
now and I realize that 
especially with what 
goes on now you can't  ______ all the time, but I reme
mber the evenings and we waited and we 

waited and we hoped for the Allied troops to co
me  and we waited and we hoped and I think 
that's what ke pt us going.  And that's what...because I reme mb er talking about it.  My pa rents 

talked about it.  We  talked about it.  We just
 waited.  We  talked about the Allied troops comi ng, 

and they came  June 6th and they went out May 
19th.  You see how close.  But they did not land 
in Belgium until Sept ember...until Septem...the early 
part of September, because I went home for 
my birthday September 14.  So this...I think this is
 what kept us going in hiding.  The feeling, the 
fear was only when you heard sabotage went on.  No
t even when we were in the country but in 

Liege...you didn't know who they we
re going to arrest.  You didn'
t know who they were going to 
put in the citadel to torture, and we had these 
Catholics, these wonderful people who would have 
done anything to to to help us, you see.  Papers were ma de out, I mean to such an extent that my 

father got called to go to Germany and then the 
the the ma yor of the village said we made a 
mi stake on his age, and they ma de him ten year
s older, you see.  Uh people who found a place 
for me  to go as a ma id.  When my sister t
ook over, found the orphanage.  Now let me  tell you 

that when they went to the orphanage, my pare
nts had to pay for it.  The orphanages, the _____, 
the Catholic did not take you in
 unless it was paid.  Re me mbe r  
these people are on donations, on 
income .  They did not take them unless you had th e means to pay for their support, and as it is, 

you know, they were rationed also, you know, so 
you...it was not an easy thing.  But that you had 
to pay for.  Our papers, our hou...we we paid th
e rent on the house, OK.  But it was minima l 
because there was no electricity.  There was no 
water.  There was nothing, but the people who 
got us the house didn't ask for anything.  The 
people ma de contact in us for anything.  The 
people...thisma n who made theth
e the false ID papers did not get paid.  The people who ma de 
the contacts for us did not get paid.  Everythi
ng was done to help us as Jews without any 
fi nancial reward.  The LeBare got jewelry.  Li
ke I say, they were gold rings.  We had British 
coins also in gold that we sold for money to 
survive.  All of that
 was brought...anybody could 
have taken...it was brought for free, for no no rewa
rd, nothing, and these people have never even 
been recognized realize.  When I went to Ya
d Vashem I saw they had name s, and I thought oh, 

my didn't I do that, but I don't know t o what 
extent they consider some body helping the 
Jews, you know, to recognize and put their name  ther
e.  I don't...maybe Rochelle put their name  
there, because there would have been cost ma king 
out the...and I mean the papers were made but

if they took our identification pape
rs when we we nt to the registr
y, we were registered in the...we 
were real, you see.  My little si
ster didn't need a card.  My cousin didn't need a card. You had to 
have them at age...was it fifteen we got the...eve
n a Belgium citizen had to
 register and carry an 
identification card. 
 

Question:  Le t's look at the day of 
liberation and how you 
got to America. 
 

Answer:  I had...this was my mother
's sister...the address was sewn 
into my coat for that purpose 
to have contact with someone and via an Americ
an GI...he contacted my a unt before civilians 
were allowed to write and I don't know how the 
letter got through because
 it gave his location, 
and I lived with my father which was...as ma
rvelous as parents as I had, my father was 
impossible.  He was an entirely different ma n.  He
 had the responsibility of
 an eighteen year old 
girl.  The soldiers were roaming the streets.  
The girls were sleeping w
ith the soldiers.  You 
know...this post-war...this 
is normal.  We 'r e talking America
n...we had the Americans in Liege.  
Uh he was old-fashioned in that  he came fr om a small village, small town in Czechoslovakia.  I 

had grown up all of a sudden to be eighteen, nine
teen.  I was...he did not
 allow me  to wear 
lipstick.  I made...became friends with
 a girl and we'd walk to each other's house.  In the evening 
the street s roamed with soldiers, and I used to fi
nd that my father didn't quite trust me  and he 
used to say why should you be different.  He used 
to follow me .  Uh this girl's name  was Rose, 
and we used to go halfway...if she came  to our house...back and forth.  And we walked and it 

was a short distance.  If I went 
out in the evening, he'd...he 'd...he
 didn't know whether to trust me  
not to...every other gi rl was sleeping...houses turned 
into prostitution homes.  I mean this is post-
war situation, and he thought I would be better off to come  to th
e United States to my aunt, and 
correspondence started and I guess my aunt prepar
ed to send me  the papers to bring me .  
Meantime  a first cousin of my 
father came through the Jewish Brigade out of Israel through Italy 
and he wanted me  to go to Israel, but it was too 
late.  My papers had b
een started to go to 
America.  It could have been ve
ry possible that I would have e
nded up in Israel instead, but only 
because we had my aunt 's...my aunt had moved but
 some how or other the 
letter reached her to 
where she had moved from one house to the other, a
nd I left my father not on the best of terms.  
There was...I resented my father for not trusting 
me .  My father resented me  for I don't whatever 
reason.  It was a very...but he did take care 
of me .  He borrowed money.  This was post-
war...Belgium took all their money off the ma rket and printed new money.  Nobody had francs, 

so he borrowed money to pay for my passage by 
boat at that time.  Called it a boat...I came on an 
American boat that had been used for troops a
nd I used to say that I came on a boat that had no 
class because it didn't have first, second or third 
class.  It was a ship that wa s used for uh 
civilian...as a ma tter of fact I had my  visa...I 
had a trouble...I had...they 
had no trouble getting a 
visa.  I had trouble getting a pa
ssport because I was considered 
without a nationality.  I was no 
longer considered Czech.  I was not considered
 a Russian, and the for...the Belgium For e ign 
Ministry gave me  a te mporary passport good for one
 year so I could put my visa on it, and I had 
to go to Antwerp to the American Consulate and I 
had to go to Brussels to the Foreign Ministry 
to get this called laissez-passe (ph)  which I 
still have, to get my visa, but I couldn't get 
passageway because the American troops were st
ill comi ng back.  The war brides were comi ng 
in and I remember it was a Saturday.  The travel agent came.  I was at my friend's house, and he 

says I have passage for you.  And overnight I had to
 prepare to come .  I s
till have the suitcase I 
came and hard papier ma che (ph)...reme mber this 
is post-war.  I had a coat that was made...my 
uncle was a tailor and the navy 
blankets from the navy, green bl
ankets, found their way on black

ma rkets.  My uncle ma de a beautiful hand-ma de , hand-ma de tailored coat...I mean very fine 
tailoring, and I came to the United States with a co
at and it was ma de from a green navy blanket, 
because you couldn't get fabrics.  I came  i
mmediately after...Belgium ha d food.  We  had 
everything, and then also they allowed...you coul
d not take money out of Belgium a nd they 
allowed five hundred francs...no, a thousand.  My fa
ther applied two hundred and twenty-five or 
two hundred smacked on your passport, on your visa
...my father allowed, my father applied for a 
thousand dollars.  They allowed five hundred, 
and I reme mbe r  going to the bank because I 
deposited it in the bank in Liege and picked it 
up in Cleveland and the ba
nker said to me , how 
did you ma nage...the two of them met so I came 
with seven hundred some thing dollars, seven 
hundred twenty-five or seven hundred seventy-five...t
his...the only thing there, so my father saw 

to my needs, but for some reason didn't  feel 
he could handle a nineteen
 year old young woma n.  
He was...uh he rema rried.  I me t his widow after he
 died.  I we nt back to Belgium and she said, 
your father lived for his wife a
nd his children.  So I came to Cleveland and lived with my aunt, 

and I had a mi serable life...don't 
put that on tape  please...
