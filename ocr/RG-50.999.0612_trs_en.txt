Julie Keef er was bornJula W einstock to Jewi sh parents in Lwow, Poland, on 
A p ri l
 
19, 1941. 
This photographof Julie is the only onethat existsf rom her tim e in hiding.
 
  
 
On thism ap of Poland the arrow points toLwow, where Julie was born.
 
  
 
In thisphotograph, Julie'sf ather, Herm an, is them anf arthestto the lef t inthe back 
row and herm other,Sala, is the womanfarthest to the lef t in thef ront row. Julie's parentsalso 

would have a younger daughter nam ed T ola.
 
  
 
In June
 
1941, Germ ans occupied Lwow. Germ an and Ukrainian authoritiesf orced all 
Jews into a ghetto, including Julie andherfam ily. On thism ap of Lwo w, the white arrow points 

to the location of the ghetto.

Julie's grandf ather,Aizik, was arrested andmadeaforced laborer.Af ter working at a 
lim e quarry, they m oved him to Janowska labor camp, indicated here with the red arrow. He 
escapedf rom this labor cam p. Learning that the Lwow ghetto wouldbe destroyed,hehelped 

Julie and her parentsand her sister hide inabunker in anearby f orest with 30other Jews f rom  

Lwo w. He then movedJulie and her sister to live with his non
-
Jewish  f riend,Lucia, because he 
feared the girls' cr ying would gi ve their hidingspotaway.
 
I n  Ma rc h
 
1942, the Germ ans 
deportedthousands of Jews who had remained in theLwo w ghetto to the Belzec killing center. 

T hey boarded trains f rom  the Kleptarow tra
in station indicated herewith the blue arrow.
 
  
 
T hisphotograph shows Lucia Nowicki on theleft and Aizik on the right. Aizik 
assumed the identity of  Lucia's husband, and they introduced Julie and her sister as her 

nieces.Aizik traveled back andforth betweenLucia's house and theforest to help thepeople 

in hiding there.
 
At onepointLucia was arrested by Security Police.W ithLucia in prison, Aizik 
hid Julie's sister in a Catholic children children's hom e.W hen Luciawas releasedf rom prison, 

she returned home and caredf or Julie.
 
  
 
Oneday while Aizik was visiting Lucia in town, the Germ ansfound the bunker in the 
forest and killed everyone hidden there, including Julie's parents.At theend of the war, as 

Soviet troops approached, the Germ ans evacuated the Catholic children's home where Julie's 

sister lived. Aizik and Julie were unable tof ind Julie's sisteraf ter the war.
 
  
 
T hisphotograph shows Julie, theolder girl on the lef t, Aizik, Lucia,and Julie'sf riend 
in a Displaced Persons camp after
 
the war.
 
  
 
Aizik sent Julie to Am erica in 1948,hoping tojoin her later. Julie lived in a children's 
homefor six years until a couplef rom  Cleveland, Ohio,adopted her.Aizik m arried Luciaand 

they eventually im m igrated tothe United States and settled in New York.
 
  
 
Following Julie's adoption by Thea and FredKlestadt at age 16 in1957 and her 
graduationf rom  high school, Julie attended Oberlin College in Ohiowhere she majored in 

French with m inors inSpanish andart.W hile at Oberlin Juliem et Larry Keefer whom  she

in specialeducation towork with em otionally disturbed adolescentsand did Ph.D
-
level study in 
human growth and developm ent. She studiedpsychology at the University of  Nebraska. Af ter 

Julie and Larry m oved to theW ashington, DC area, she continued her studies atBowie State 

Universit y and several otheracadem ic institutions.
 
  
 
Julie spent 29 years wi th the Montgomery County Maryland Public School System 
retiring in 2001. Over the course of thosethree decades she held anumberof  key positions 

including Mainstream Coordinator working wi th special needs students and teachers at several 

high schools,and participated in teacher training program s,
 
som e inconjunction with American 
Universit y. All of them  dealt with educationequity. Am ong herm any accomplishments she 

created LUPE, an anti

studentsat an area high school. Amemorable occasion was a visit by President Clinton and 

British Prim e Minister Tony Blair to ahigh school where she was the Adm inistrator

Julie's husband is a Ph.D. chem ist who workedf irst at the ChicagoMedical School 
andthe University of  Nebraska Medical School before joining the scientif ic staff at the National 

Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute here in theW ashington, DC area in1971. Much 

of  Larry's career has been devoted to cancerresearchand cancer
-
related drug development. 
L a rry re ti
red on October 1st,2015, af ter44 years with the NIH/NCI.Larry is here with Julie 
today.
 
  
 
Julie and Larry have two children, Steve and Sim ona, and three grandsons.
 
T he i r

son Steve, aformer Arm y Ranger, received a dualdegree in econom ics and Japanese
 
f r om  
theW hartonSchool ofBusinessand the University of  Pennsyl vania. He now owns two 
businesses. Steve's oldest sonhas just returnedf rom Israeland wil l be in charge of the

artist and after a career in photography, painting and glasswork now is a businesswom an.Her 

son has just com pleted his sophom ore yearat Springbrook High School in Maryland. As Julie 

noted to me with pride, "We got really luck y on kids and grandkids."
 
  
 
Julie has worked as avolunteer at the Mem bership Deskof  this museum on 
T hursdays and lateron Mondays where shehas shared her story wit h visitors. Most recently, 

she has been out on sick leave but hopes to return in July.
 
I think today represents a step 
forward to doing that.
 
  
 
In addition to Larry, Julie is accom panied today by her daughter Simona.
 
  
 
W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Julie Keef er.

Julie, thank you som uch for joining us today and being willin g to beour Fi
rs t  
P
erson, particularly knowing that you've been ill of late. So we are really glad to have you 
back. I know you're a little worried about yourvoice not being strong, but I think with the 

m icrophones it will wor k out justf ine.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Pleasef orgive m e if  I change octaves. My voice is notunder m y control. And I 
apologize. If  you cannot hearm e,pleasemake sure to raise a hand. Ok?And I have to thank 

all of  you so muchfor taking your tim e and com ing here today.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julie, you have som uch to share with us in a shortperiod so we'll just jum p 
right in if  that's ok.
 
 
W orldW ar II began with the invasion of Poland by f irst Germany then Russia in 
September
 
1939. Youwere born in April
 
1941.W hen you were born, the city where your fam ily 
lived was underSoviet occupation. I know yo u know ver y little about your fam ily andtheir lives 

prior to your
 
birthbutto the extent that you can, share with us whatyou do know about your 
fam ily prior to your birth.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
First Ihave to say that what I know are things thatm y grandfather wrote in his 
diary. Som e things I rem em ber but I rem em ber them
 
with the eyesof  a child. And some things 
I was told.
 
 
W hat I knew aboutm y fam ily bef orehand was that m y grandf ather was an im port 
food and vegetabledealer, m iddle class. My m other was a Jewish opera singer. My father
 
--
 
andhere is where thetranslation is interesting
 
--
 
was either a tinsm ith or aplum ber. Itdepends 
whether you readthePolish or the Russian records.Sohe was one of  theabove.
 
My parents 
were li ving ok until the
 
Ru ssia n s cam e a nd
 
tim esbecam e very hard.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know anything about your extendedfam ily?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
I know that m y grandf ather'sbrothersone way or anotherdied. His wif e was 
killed at Belzac. His parents, extendedf am ily, m ost of them  were killed at Belzac.
 
 
My uncle, you saw his picture. I do not know
 
his nam e, m y mother's older brother, 
was in the Polish Arm y and I guesshe was killed there. He was thegentleman on the right, in 

theunif orm . Andbelow him  was his wif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A couple m ore questions about that tim e. You had som ef am ily at tha
t tim e in  
the United States.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Mm
-
hm m .

>> Bill Benson:
 
How did they get to be here? 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
My gr andfather's parents sent the two daughters they had to Am ericabecause 
at that tim ethere were pogrom s, where Jews were rounded up and
 
of ten wom en or killedor 
rapedor both. Sotoprevent that,m y grandf ather'sf ather senthis two daughters to Am erica 
and they settled in Brooklyn.
 
 
I alsohad a greataunt. I don't know how or why she cam e to Am erica but I 
rem em ber that she and her twin brother came toAmerica. Andm y great Aunt Helen, whoI 

adored, was about yay high, with great, big, huge blueeyes and this m agnif icentface.Shehad 

her twin brother who was afarmer
 a
nd, of course, hadf ive daughters and was so disappointed 
no sons to help him  on hisf arm .
 
 
W hat I rem em ber about Uncle Charlie was that he drove through the mountains like 
af iend.
 
He was just, "Uhhh."  He had the biggest hands Ihad ever seen, huge, hugehands. 
W hen I  sa w 
ﬁT he Potato E
aters
ﬂ 
by Van Gogh
,  
I continuedto rem ember m y Uncle Charlie.
 
 
Anyway, m y t wo grandfather
™
s sist e rs
 
--
 
they lived together in a house they shared. 
T he older one was a widow and her daughterlived in the house also. Andthe younger one 

was m arried and hada daughter who was f our years older than
 
I . A n d  
T
an
ta
 
Rosa, the oldest, 
hada daughterthat was eight years older than I. 
 
 
It was ver y hardf orm y aunt. Ithinkm y grandfather guilt trippedherand said,oh, 
you know, you will take m y granddaughter. And I don't think she waslookingf orward to 
tha t. 

And I can't blam e her. Here I was this little 
h
eathen who grew up ina war, hadn't really seen 
plumbing before. My English consisted of one, two, three,f our,f ive,six, seven, eight, nine,10, 

period.And if  anybody said anything else. And the only school I had gone to was a school in 

Hebrew. And suddenly she was stuck with me.
 
 
She had her own issues.W hen she f irst
 
--
 
she adoredher older brother,m y 
grandfather. Andhe was like her hero.W hen shef irst saw m e,at aCatholic orphanage inNew 

Yo r k  w
hen we had just landed inBostonand thenby bus we went toNew York, I remember 
her standing at the bottom  of  the stairs and speaking toone of the nuns in Germ an. She could 

have spoken English and I wouldhave understood nothing she said but, infact, she said, 

when she saw me, "Oh, that can't
 
be 
Aizik's granddaughter. He's so
 
--
 
and she's so."  And that 
startedoff our relationship.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And Julie, I hope we'll get to later how diff icult the adjustment was af ter you 
arrived here.T here were tough tim esf or you in getting here. But going back, you were born in 

April of  1941 and Nazi Germ any turned in June
 
41.W ithindays the city of Lwow, where you  
lived, was occupied by the Nazis. Your f am ily was quickl y f orced into a ghetto.W hatdid that 

m ean 
for your fam ily, for all of  you including your grandf ather, Aizik?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
My gr andfather andm y f ather got together and planned ahiding place, which 
was of ten called a bunker, a special secret com partm ent in his barn.Andm y mother, very 

pregnan
t, and Iand my f ather, grandfather and others, were hiding in that secret bunker until 

m y grandfather lef ttogo visit a f riend who didn't have any hiding place andthen he was picked 

up. Andhe was sent to hisfirst labor cam p, which was Jaktorow, and that's where he worked 

in the lim estone quarry, which was eight kilom etersf rom  the camp itself. He would work in the 

quarry, taking rocks and
 
he had to bring them back to the camp, enduring beatings all thetim e.
 
 
I visited that place when I wentfour years
 
ago. It is now appropriately an insane 
asylum .T he building where the comm andant lived is the kind of headquarters of  it. I was told 

by a wom an we m et there
 
--
 
she said, you know, I was not born yet but I was told thatthe 
ground
 
--
 
this place looked very
 
pastoral, absolutely gorgeous with greenery andmountains 

 
5
 
andhills and valleys, just beautif ul looking. And on oneof  these hills is a monument. It isfrom  
the Israeli governm ent. It says basically that 20,000 Jews were m urdered there. And it's 

interesti
ng because this wom an said thatherfam ily m em bers said" I rem em ber the ground 
m oving f orthree days."
 
W hat had happenedwas a huge trench was dug, usually by prisoners 
them selves, and people were shotand buried but some were buriedalive, so kind ofm ove
d,  

the ground m oved.
 
 
If you read Father D
es
bois' book,"T he Hol
ocaust by Bullets"  he described som e of  
thatalso, in the Ukraine, when he andhis colleagues went thereto identif y Jews who hadno 

known graves and who were just buriedhereor there, tof ind what their names were. Father 

De
sbois studied, worked with, M
ot
he r  T
eresa. And
 
he remem beredso well Mother T
eresa 
saying ever yone deserves a nam e.Sohe, too, was boundand determ ined to goandf ind the 

names of those who were not killed in gas cham bers
 
or inother ways but who were killed by 
bulletsandburied in unm arked graves.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julie, your grandf ather, as you were describing tous, of  course,he was 
arrestedand sent to thef irst cam pand thenhe would be sent toa second cam p, Janowsk
a . 
T ell us a little bitaboutwhat happened to him there.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Janowska was later known
 
--
 
began as a labor camp and turned intoa killing 
cam p. It was a huge cam p. Ihave som epictures of pieces of  it now.W henhe got captured, 

f irst thing that happened was thathe was taken toKleptarow stationandpeople were 

separated intotwo gro ups. Abled
-
bodiedm en were puton one side, wom en weak looking or 
anyone who hadany handicap or children were put intoanother side.
 
 
T his getsa little graphic. So if there are young children here, please m ake sure you 
talk tothem  later and process things with them .
 
 
Babies were takenby thefoot, by theirf eet, children under 2,and they were thrown 
against thesehuge pillars and their skulls wer e crushed.They were thrown into the trains wi th 

them othersand everyoneelse who didn'tm ake the countand sent to Belzac, which was a gas 

cam p. And in Belzac
 
--
 
well, Belzac doesn'texist any longer but atthe train station there is a 
sign saying f rom  this station, Kleptarow, 500,000 Jews were killed, were takenand killed at 

Belzac cam p. And,of  course, this was what we had to lookf orward to. And this is what m y 

grandfather saw. He was takenbecausehe was very strong.
 
 
As a m atter of f act,
 
th e
 
f i r s t t i m e I  r ea d  abou t  
JeanValjean, I kept thinking aboutm y 
grandfather because JeanValjean was basically f ound becausehewas so strong that he 

could lif ta cart, which he did to save som eone's life. Andm y grandfather could lif t a car. 
 
 
So he was m y everythi ng. He was takenbecause he could be a good worker. He 
lost 100
 
pounds. One of  his f riends
 
--
 
he watchedone of hisf riends expire in agony because 
he was hung by hisfeet untilhedied.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your grandf ather was whipped viciously in one particular case.
 
>> J u
lie Keefer:
 
Yeah,he was. He had said to the 
c
ommandant that, you know, these
 
beds 
so -
called, wooden slats, would 
hold eight peop
le at most butnot16.And the c
om mandant was 
so irritatedthat a Jew daredto talk this way to him that he hadm y grandf ather receive 100 

lashes.And the rule was if you ref usedto give the 100 lashes to whoever, and it was usually a 

Jew who was f orced to do this, you got200 and the Jew got killed im mediately. 
 

 
W ell,m y grandfather was blackand blue andthatnight he was, of  course, in agony, 
buthisf ellow prisoners had gotten cold, wet m aterial and put itonhis back andhis body. So 

thenext m orning when he gotupfor what is called [Speaking Non
-
English Language], w
hich 
m eans thehead count, the commandant came by and said,
 
" Oh, you dog. You'realive. I 

 
6
 
expected youto die. Die, Jew dog, die." Andthis commandanthad a habit of  shooting people 
in the head. He didn't like where your Jewish star was sewed on your jacket orpants, he would 

shoot I inthe head.
 
 
So the reason it
 
was called a killing cam p is200,000 Jews were kill edf rom  that 
ca m p,  Jan o wska .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And your grandf ather, despite what he went through, endedupescaping f rom  
there. 
T e ll u s  
about his escape.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
He was told thenext day
 
--
 
becaus
e he had lost 100
 
pounds and,of  course, a 
lot of his strength. Hewas told he wouldbe takento thebackand shot the next day. So he 

decided to escape.
 
 
T here is a song by Janice Joplin
, ﬁ F
reedom 'sjust another nam e f ornothing left to 
lose.
ﬂ 
He had noth
ing lef t to lose. So where the centuries brought innew prisoners, there were 
huge gates. And the gates were openedfor new prisoners and he ran out and down a hill.W e 

saw where that probably was. Crossed the streetand there was thishuge like hole or wh
atever 

andat thebottom  of it a train ran. He was goi ng there.And ashe jum ped, he was shot in the 

right handbut he managed to get to the other side justas atrain
 
--
 
a munitions train was 
com ing. So he ran with the train andhis lif e was saved.
 
 
B u t, 
he had a bleeding hand, he had a thin cotton uniform, the concentration cam p 
unif orm , andno shoesbecause hisfeet were so big and, of course,all the clothes of all the 

prisoners were taken and they were gi ven like wooden shoesand nothing would fit him  
so he 

was barefoot. And thiswas in late Novem ber.And in Poland it was snowing and terribly cold. 

So he was running. He wound up in a small woodsand wondering how can God do this to the 

innocent Jewish people.
 
 
T henhe was desperate and ran tothe hom eo
f  a Polish peasant, Mr.
 
Bereczki. And 
I'm  still trying to go and get him as oneof  the righteous amongst nations. T his isam an, again, 

poorm an who, of  course, knew thatm y grandf ather was a Jew,f rom  a concentration camp, 

because he saw the uniform. Even
 
thoughmy grandf ather had ripped off the Jewish star. He 
bandaged
 
--
 
well, he put 
m e rc u ro c hrome
 
inm y grandfather's hand, bandaged it, gave him 
warm  clothing and som e food and said," Look, go sleep inm y barn."  My grandfather said, " No. 

I can't dothat." Because in Poland if  you were a non
-
Jew who helped a Jew, your fam ily was 
hung inf rontof  your eyes and they were lef ton lamp
-
posts, then you were shot and then the 
Jew was killed.
 
Som y grandfather was very unwill ing to do this. Andthem an said, "Look,
 
I ' ll  
leave thebarndoor open and if the Nazis com e, I'll say who knows who goes in m y barn?T he 

door was open."  
 
 
So that's where he spent the night.
 
Thefollowing day, Mr.
 
Bereczki gave him  a 
shovel, somefood and threebreads and saltandtook him
 
--
 o
h,they wrapped hisfeet in rags 
because,of  course,nobody had shoes tof ithim . Mr.
 
Bereczki took him  tothef orest which was 
about six kilom eters away and told him  to hide him self  there. And the shovel was to dig aditch 

for him self  so that he couldhidef rom the elem ents but alsof rom  the Nazis because it was a 

ver y vast woods.
 
Somy grandf ather did that. 
 
 
Meanwhile, m y father, m y m other, andm y baby sister was born whil e they were in 
hiding.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In the ghetto.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
In that bunker in the ghetto.And I oftenthinkhow couldm y m other do it.How 
could she give birth to a live child and stay alive herself in a situation where there was no 

m edicine,nofood, there were dead bodiesall over the place? How could she cope? But 

 
7
 
apparentl
y shedid becausem y baby sister was born.
 
 
T henm y grandf atherwas hiding in the woods. One day he heard som e men.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Inthem eantim e, you're still all hidden.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
W e'reall still hidden. T hat's right. Thank you. Right.
 
 
My gra n d
father is in this sm all tunnel. Other Jews com e.And one ofthem  has a gun. 
Som y grandfather had been a soldier inW orldW arI, so he becam e head.T he tunnel got 
m oreand more expandedby m oreand more people com ingf rom  sm all towns near Lwow,  all 

around,
 
until there was 30
-
som e Jews hiding in this tunnel.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hich he had been enlarging.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
All the m en were. And themen would go out at night and shoot the tiresof  
Nazi m unitionstrucks and grab guns and amm oand grenades.T hey would also go to the 

Ukrainian collaborator hutsand grab cheese,canned goods, whatever they could, and water, 

and whatever they could grab tobring back to thepeople in the tunnel.
 
 
Oneday as m y grandfather went to Mr.
 
Bereczki's house again, hefound ou
t  th a t 
the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto. Of course, we were still hiding there.Sohe tooka 

Nazi com m and car, aNazi unif orm
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That they had stolen.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
T hat they had stolen.Thankyou. Right, Bill. Anddecided to go to the ghetto to 
get us out. Andhe went atnight. Heasked the otherm en to stay in theforest a little bitf ar 

away and he would goto the ghettohim self. Because he knew exactly where we were.
 
So he went in. He took m e andm y f ather took m y baby sister andmy m otherand we all got 

som ehow to the command car. W e were supposed to go to Mr.
 
Bereczki's, m y grandfather and 
he hadtalked about how they were going to hidem y m other,m y baby sister, Tola, andm e.I 

was alm ost 3. My baby sister was 5 months.
 
 
W hat
 
I rem em ber about that tim e is a coupleof  things. I rem em berthat tunnel. I 
rem em ber it so clearly. And som etim e if  we have tim e I'lldescribe ityou. But I don't rem ember 

any people in it. I rem em berm y grandf ather, that's all.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And yet 30
-
plus people were there.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
W ere there. Uh
-
huh.T he men were going out oftento get suppliesand todo 
whatever they could.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You endedupnot staying with Mr.
 
Bereczki though.And why was that? 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Because m y mother said, look, I've lost m y mother,I've lost som uch, I'm  not 
going to losem y husband and you,f ather, I'm  not going tobe separated. If  I die, I want todie 

with m y f am ily.W hat's left of it. So she got her wa y. M y baby sister and I were takento the 

tu
nnel.
 
 
Now, the tunnel, we all got lice. It was cold and dam p andfull of all kinds of insects. 
W ecouldn't really bathe. It was too cold to bathe in cold water. Andthe other thing was
 
--
 
we ll,  
we tried to wash but we had to use the waterwe got f or drinking.W e couldnot cook or make 

f iresbecausethe Nazis would see the sm oke. So it was a toughplace tobe.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
E s pe c ia lly f o r lit t le  k id s .
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Especially f or little kids. Now, I have to describe it to you, if you don't mind. Is 
th a
t  o k?  O k.
 
 
T his isa way
 
--
 
rem ember, I was alm ost 3 at this point. So them em ory I have is of a 
ver y tall ladder, a wooden ladder going down, which probably was no more than six f eet. And I 

rem em ber these walls that were wet clay or m ud.T hey were dam p. I
 
remember feeling m y 
wa y. T here was one kind of long room . And ever ything, I rem em berthat clay, that cold,dam p

clay. And at the endofthat room  was a round, wooden, 
s
plintery table and on it squatted afat 
candle. And that was the source of light. AndI
 
remember touchingm y way around andfeeling 
all of  that. And thenthere was like anarch way to the side. And in thatarchway was another 
room m uch sm aller than thisone. But what I rem ember about it was it was dark and I 

rem em ber touch
i n g 
touching or trying to touch som ething. And it was thef irst time m y 
grandfather raised his voice to me. He raisedhis hand." Don't touch!"  He was aboutto sm ack 

m y hand. 
 
 
Now, m y grandf atherwas my darling and I was his andhenever raised his voice 
m uch less hishand tom e. SoI was shocked. And can you guess why he raisedhis voice? 

Anybody? 
 
>>
 
[Inaudible] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Knockover the candle? 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
T hat's a good point. But thecandle was still in theother room.T his was in a 
separate room  on the side.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W eapon s ?  
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Exactly. It was guns and ammunitionand grenades. And if  Ihad touched that, 
som ething m ighthavegone off. So that's why.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I know you have som uch more to share with usandour time is getting a li
ttle  
bit on the short side. You did not stay in thebunker terribly long before your grandfather had to 

m ake the decisionforyou not to stay there.Tell us about the events fromtheref or you.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Because we cried
 
--
 
I could be stopped but how doyou stopa 6
-
m onth
-
old, a 
5 -
m on t h
-
old baby? Sooneday m y m otherput her hand over Tola'sm outhand almost 
suff ocated her. My gra ndfather said, 
ﬁ
Sala, stop, you'll smother thebaby.
ﬂ 
So he decided he 
would get us out of there because we were endangering not only our fam ily but everybody 

else. And grandpa was the leader and he couldn't endanger the lives of 30
-
som e people for his 
grandchildren.
 
 
So he dressedas aPolish peasant, with Mr.
 
Bereczki's help. Hehad one of these 
jackets thathepulled up the collar very high. He borrowed a cartf rom  Mr.
 
Bereczki. It wasnot 
uncomm onto go to the centralm arket of Lwow. He did that. And in the centralmarket he was 

lookingf or adoctor who rana Catholic orphanage and couldnotf ind him. He describeshow 

desp
eratehe was. Hecouldn't f ind him. Andhe didn't know what todo. So what he did was he 
was thinking of just leaving us because we were little and cute andhe thought, well, som eone 

would take us and save our lives. And if  he lived through the war, he wou
ld com e and get us 

af ter the war was over.
 
 
Just at that pointhe ran into a wom an who had been aneighborof his, a Polish 
Catholic wom an. Her nam e is on the wall of the righteousamongst nations, Lucia Nowicka. 

She is theone who saved our li
ves. She bec
am e m y pretend aunt
. T old us pretend aunt. 
Supposedly T olaand Iwere her sister's children andher sister wasfrom the sm all town nearby 

andher sisterhad been killed.
 
T here was a lot of f ighting at thatpoint between Polsand 
Ukrainians. And they were Polish and they were supposedly killed by Ukrainians.
 
 
So he said, 
ﬁ
Lucia, can you takethe babies and save their lives?ﬂ And she said, ﬁB
ut  
Aizik, I no longer have m y own hom e. I live as a live
-
in housekeeperfor a retired engineer and 
his wif e in the country. So I'd have to ask Mrs.
 
Swierc zynski if  I could takethe children.
ﬂ 
So she 
did, and could shebring her nieces, her sister diedand she had to take care of  them . And 

Mrs .
 
Swierc zynski said sure, why not. So we cam e there as hernieces.
 
 
My grandfather
, asBill m entioned to you, took her husband's,deadhusband's, 

 
9
 
papers and becam e instead of Aizik Eisen he becam e Stanislaus Nowicka, 6'2" , Hazel
-
colored 
eyes, about220or sopounds, so he could pass.
 
 
At that point
 
--
 
Lucia lived as thishousekeeper who
 
took care of thecooking, the 
cleaning, the skinny horse, the skinnier cow. And she was there and m y grandfather was in the 
area working at various farms, trying to get apotatohere,a chickenthere,anything tobring 

back and help.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Had h
e gone back to the bunker yet?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Not yet. He hadnot gone back to thebunker yet.
 
 
T hen someone on thestreet,a wom an downthe street, said that Lucia Nowicka, 
housekeeperfor the Swierc zynskis, was hiding Jewish children. Now, the Gestapo cam e to 

question her and tookher for questioning
, w
hich m eant she was im prisonedand tortured. 
W henm y grandfathercam e back tothe house, he couldn'tf indLucia. Mrs.
 
S wie rczyn ski wa s 
kind 
of beside herself .So he said, ﬁW
ha t ' s  goi n g o n ?
ﬂ 
W el l ,  Mrs .
 
S wi e
rczynski said that the 
Gestapo tookher housekeeper and shedoesn't know why. So grandpa said, you know, 

Mrs .
 
Swierc zynski, you're a friend of the wif eof  the Nazi governor of Lwow. Now, the Nazi 
governor of Lwow l i ved in the house next to the Swierczynskis. So there were soldiers all 

a
round. Som y grandfather said,Well, can you talk to the governor's wif e andf ind out what's 
going on and get Lucia back? 
 
 
W hile she was gone
 
--
 
by the way, Mrs.
 
S wier czynski could not cope with a little tiny 
baby. She was old. And she had a house to take care of and all of this cooking to do and these 

animals. So she went to the governor's wif e and said, look, they took Luciaand Idon't know 

wh y and I really don't know what to do without her because I can't do all of  this.
 
 
Meanwhile, before this happened, m y gra
ndfather decided to save T ola
' s l i f e  b y 
taking her,at 6 months old, to a Catholic orphanage run by a professor of  pediatrics at the 

university and also a pediatrician who ran this children's hom e. He changed hernam
e f rom 
T olaW einstock, Jewish child,to Antonina Nowicka, Catholic child, 6 m onths old, blondishhair, 

blueeyes, and paid three m onths in advanceandthought, well, at least oneof  us will sur vi ve 

the war.
 
 
He came back.Andthen he talked with Mrs.
 
S wi e r
c zynski aboutapproaching the 
governor's wif e to getLuciaback becausehe was terrif iedthat theGestapo was going tokill 

her or tortureher sobadly that she would tell that we were all Jewish  and that thepeople inthe 

woods were Jewish as  well.
 
W e ll,  
t h e c
om mandant heard. He took his car, whatever, and went 
to Gestapo quartersand told the Gestapo to get Lucia andbring herright down. So Lucia was 

told by the Gestapo to cleanup andtonottalk abouther experiences ever to anyone. Andshe 

cam e back tothe Swierczynski's hom e to resum e herduties.
 
AsI say, she had beentortured. 
So she was a littlebit high strung af ter this and had a hard time.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But she had stuck to the story that you were her nieces?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
She absolutely, and didn't tell anything about anything. Andm y grandf ather 
felt, well, ok, one child was saf e atthe children's hom e, I was safe where I was, now he had to 

go to the woods and check on how ever ybody was doing in the woods.
 
 
It was now April, right aroundm y birthday. Itwas 1944. He went tothe woods.And 
atf irst he thought something'sf unny. This tunnelhas been disturbed.Then hefound the 

bodies. He thought maybe it was our own gre nades or whatever.T hen he andone otherman 

who had gone to work with th
e resistance found that all the bodies had bullet holes. So he and 

this otherm an saida prayer f or the dead andburiedall 30
-
som epeople in that sam e tunnel in 
the Borszczo wice woods. And therem y parents lie inanunm arkedgra ve somewhere in the 

 
10
 
B o r s zc z
owice Forest.
 
 
W hen we went back,m y husbandand I, in 2013, we were going thr ough the 
Borszc zowice Forest and trying tof indthesehuge depressions.W efound lots of depressions 
but
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
No way to know.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
No way to know. Right, no way to know. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So your grandfather's there.He's just buried hisdaughter and son
-
in
-
law and 
your parentsand many others, and now he makes his way back toLucia and the 

Swierc zynskis. W hat happened then? 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
T henhe was now living there with Lucia.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As her husband.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Asher husband. Andpretty soon, two m onths later,the Russians came and 
liberated usand the war was over
 f
or us.
T
hen, we started kindof
 
--
 
well, he kept
 
--
 
he started 
looking 
f or m y sister.The children's home, the roof had been bom bed,and she had been 
m oved to adiff erenttown in Poland. He wentthereand lookedfor her. Nothing.
 
So at that 
pointhedecided to try otherplaces. He heard that the children, 80 of them, were broken into 

two groups, 40 went to W estern Europe som ewhere and40 were taken to Hungary. Now, at 

thattim e you could not get into Hungary at all. It was tight with the Russians so couldn't get in 

there at all.
 
He went everywhere, to Germ any to France, to Austria, to you nam e it, could not 
f ind any trace of these 40 children. And we've been looking ever since.
 
 
Oh, then we were li vin g in a DP cam p, ourthird one now.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A displacedpersons cam p.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Or delayed pilgrim s.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
So we were, indeed, delayed. Ok?So there we were, inour
 
third one which 
was the [Indiscernible]cam p, very close to Austria. This cam p was the largest of the three in 

Austria andthe most prim itive. It was m eant to be very tem porary. So
 
people lived in shacks 
and old
-
f ashioned Army barracks which were broken into room s. Eachf am ily got one room. 
T here was no indoor plum bing. There was noheat.T here was no,of course, electricity. T here 

was no water. You had to get your waterf rom anoutside spigotandtheprivies were all in a 

row on one sideof  thecam p. It was not a great place to be.
 
 
My grandfather wanted us
 
t o 
go toIsrael but
 
--
 
at that tim e it was Palestine. But 
Palestine was nottaking any
 
m ore old people and orphaned children be
cause it was in a state 
of  wa r it s e lf .
 
So he triedf or Am erica but youcouldnot get visas toAm ericaatall, except if you 
were an orphanand you were born between certain years, you could come to America.W ell, I 

qualif ied. I was 7 years old. Grandpa sen
t m e to  Am e rica
 s
o I couldhave a better life. I could 
havef ood and saf ety and shelter anddisease f ree.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you traveled here by yourself without any fam ily m em bers.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
I traveled with a group of orphan girls. I was the youngest by f ive years. 
Grandpa talked to a 13
-
year
-
old gi rl and asked her to be in charge of me; thatI was little and 
he was going to be sosad. I was all he had lef t.W ould she lookaf ter m e?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you rem em ber anything about how youf elt at tha
t time ?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Yes. Irem em ber that very cle arly. Before we came to Am erica we had to have 
all kinds of shots and im munizations,and sowe were in a seriesof different orphanages.T he 

f irst one, I rem em ber one day walkin g with my grandf ather. At
 
thispoint he hadm arried the 
wom an who saved our lives and she becam em y grandm other.Andwe were all walkin g. Itwas 

 
11
 
beautif ul,beautif ul spring day. AndI rem em berf lowers all around. Irem ember we were 
walkin g in af ield.W e saw what looked like kind of  wire, like a cage.And there were children 

there.They were sticking their noses inthe wi re things. I rem emberfeeling just awful because 

they all looked so sad.So I rem ember taking Dziad zia's handand saying, 
ﬁY
ou won't putm e 
there, will you?
ﬂ 
And h
e said, 
ﬁN
o , I wo n 't.
ﬂ 
I sa id , 
ﬁP
r om i s e .
ﬂ 
He  sa id,  
ﬁO
k,  I  p ro m ise.
ﬂ 
A week 
later we were at theentranceof  this hom e and I was put into it. 
 
 
And If elt totally betrayed. If eltterribly lonely andnot wanted.I rem emberI told you 
that grandma'sm ind was
 
affected when shewas tortured and she couldn't cope with thef act 
that she was losing me. SoI rem em berher bending down and saying to m e, whispering, "See 

how terrible you are?Even your
 d
ziadzia 
does not like
 
you." And so I was sad. W e wentfrom  
one or
phanagetoanother. I stopped eating. Iwas just kind of wasting awa y, I guess, because 
oneof  thenuns saidto anotherone, "W ebetter call the grandf ather. She'snot going to live."  

So they called. He and babciu cam e. And dziadzia gave m e m yf irst real t
oy, a China doll with 
eyes thatopened andclosed.And he gave adozen oranges tothe nuns and sum tothis girl 

who he wantedto watch me.
 
 
Now, oranges were pri celess at that tim e. Nobody had oranges. Hekissed me. I 
rem em ber I goton theship. T he ship was anold Naval vessel converted to take 800
-
plus 
passengers to Boston, Am erica. I thought
 
--
 
Iwas ver y lonely.W e girls slept on what they 
called hamm ocks. And there werefour of them . AndI slept on the bottom  onebecause I was 

obviously the shortest.But what I remember is somethingm oving all thetim e.T erribly seasick. 

I remember a terrible, terrible tooth ache. Because in DP cam p anything American was 

wo n
derful. So what did we get?
 
Co c a
-
Cola.W hat did we li ve on? Coca
-
Co la . W ell,  it  d id  a 
number on m
y teeth, Iguess. SoI had thismassive, m assive toothache. My f riend talkedto 
oneof  thenuns and the nuns putoil of  cloves on it.T o this day when I smell oil of cloves, I 

rem em ber thatfeeling on that
 
ship.But it took eight agonizing days to gof rom
 
B r em en  t o a t 
that point Boston.
 
 
Just as an aside
,  
infourth grade, in Am erica,we were studying geography andour 
teacher was pointing out this isthe distancebetween thisand this.W ell, thedistance between 

Brem en andBoston was thisbig. Ok? And ittookeight days. So I decided geography lied.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e'reat the endof our tim e. You have to closeourprogram . Obviously we  
could spend a great deal m ore time with Juliejust hearing abouther transition,ending up in 

Cleveland in an orphanagefora number of years before being adopted when you were 16, I 

believe.
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
I was 16.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And then later, of course, your grandfather and Lucia would com e to the United 
States. I wish we had tim eto hear that.
 
 
T he one last thing I would like you 
t o 
share wi th us is you lost your parents so 
young, in a terrible way. You do not rem em ber them but youtoldme that there isa song that 

for you evokes them em ory of  your mom .
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
As I mentionedto you, m y mother was a Jewish opera singer. She hada 
gorgeous voice.W hat I rem ember about m ym other, yes, that song[Indiscernible], if I'm saying 

it correctly. It's a Yiddish lullaby and very, ver y beautif ul. And I rem emberthat she was sof t and 

cuddly and she smelled m ilky. That'sall I remem ber about her. And I guess she must have 

sm elled m ilky because she was nursing m y baby sister. And she was sof tand cuddly andhad 

this gorgeous voice, in contrast to Lucia.
 
 
Lucia I have to describe asa wom an who could swear in 30diff erent lan
guages.
 

 
12
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Couldnot sing lullabies?
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
Iasked her to sing a lullaby onceand I gotthis croaking sound of abar song. I 
said, well, never m ind.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
And that's when Inoticed that there was adiff erence. Then she was also very, 
ver y thin and bony and m y m other was niceand soft.
 
One day she had m e in her arm s and 
was taking m e on a bus, saying she was m y m other. AndI said, " You're notmy mother!"  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julie'sgoing to close our program  in just a couple ofm om ents. It's our tradition 
at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
thatour First Personhas the last word, so Julie will c lose the program .

It's our tradition that our FirstPersonhasthe last word. So, Julie? 
 
>> Julie Keefer:
 
W ell, I feel very, ver y f ortunate. Ihave been so lucky
 
in m y life. I have had 
help when I thought Iwould never have help, nor did I want itat times. But I was sofortunate 

tom eet people and have them inm y lif e whom ade lif e worthwhile and living.
 
 
My work in the Holocaust Museum is so great because I get tom eet all of these 
wonderful young people who are so super.T hey're sm art.T hey care. They're dedicated to
