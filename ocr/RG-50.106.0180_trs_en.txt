Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca
ust
 
Memorial
 
Museum
 volunteer 
collection int
erview wi th 
Helen Schwartz
, conducted by 
Gail Schwartz
, on March 
1
st
, 2010, in 
Silver Spring
,
 Maryland
. This is a post-Holocaust interview, and so I 
just wanted to give out some of your information first. You wer
e born 
Hela 
Kirschner
, April 8
th
, 1925, in 
Lódz
, 
Poland
. You were i n the 
Lódz
 ghetto from 
1939 to August 1944. Then you were in 
Auschwitz
 from August 1944, and then to 
Stutthof
, to 
Proust
, and many other places. And when you were on t he march, 
towards the end of the war, you were liberat ed March, 1945, near 
Gdansk
. 
Answer: Yes. 
Q: Oka y. So let™s t alk now, what happened after that. What Œ where did you go after 
liberation?  

A: After the liberati on, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by 

the Russians. They took very good care of us, the y supplied us with food, with 

clothes, because we were almost cl othes-less. Nothing that we had on was a sack. 

No shoes, no nothing. The Russians supplied us with everything the y could, but it 

didn™t take us long Œ w-we stayed i n a group, ma ybe eight or 10 women Œ girls 
mostly, young women. And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we 
were invaded by Œ by lice, and two da ys, three days after, everybody fell sick. And 

by being sick, the Russians were afraid to com e near us, and we di dn™t know what

was wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the 
girls was probably normal , and didn™t know what happening. But when the Russians 

didn™t come near us, we kept on asking, why don™t we get any help, or anything, to 

make us well? And we were told, either there were nurses, or the y were Œ I Œ I s Œ to 

this da y I don™t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus 
fever. And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military, 
that they might get  sick, too. There was one woman who had a daughter m y age. 
Q: You Œ you were 20 years old at the ti me.  
A: Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I Œ and there was one woman, as I sa y, 

and she spoke a litt le Russian. She ran out  to get help, so we can go to a hospital. 

Soon after, a wagon with a German came, horse and wagon, and t he y put us all on a 

wagon, and 
supposingly
 we went to a hospital . But it wasn™t a hospit al, it was a 
school converted into a hospit
al
, because there were many other women from other 
areas, which I Œ I Œ I sti ll don™t know where they came from. And they put ha y on 

the floor, and we were layi ng on t he hay, with no pillows, with no not hing, but all 

we wanted i s help. The Russians did a lot for us. 

Q: A-Are you still near 
Gdansk
, still, at the ti me? 
A: Yeah, that was, yes, near the area where I was liberated. I can™t  account the t ime, 

but after a while, the y took us to another place, which was better t han the hospital,

the school hospital . And at that ti me we saw al ready Russian doct ors, Russian 
nurses. But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn™t even Œ even 

stand if a German ca Œ if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same 
floor at the time when t hey were there. Because the Russi ans suffered a lot too, 

from the Germans. And 
supposingly
, I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why 
the Russians were so mad at the Germans, that  after, when we came back to 

ourselves, when we Œ we Œ we were sick for t wo months. So I cannot count the ti me 

when we felt better, but I assume ma ybe a month, ma ybe six weeks. We kept on 

asking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. And the y said, they killed our 

parents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as the y kill ed your sisters and 

brothers. But, after two months, we were released, and we were told Œ we were 

asked where we want t o go. So I said, I want t o go back to 
Lódz
 to find out who 
survived. And Red Cross took us over at t he time, and the y brought us back to 

Lódz
.
 
Lódz
 was just as bad as the place we came from, which, I don™t know the 
name of the place, but was near 
G da nsk
. We didn™t have anybody, but I found a 
place which was for me to sta y, with some other people. And every day we went to 

check the list of the people who survived, and who came from 
Lódz
. So I found m y 
sister and m y brot her al so survived. But m y sister came after to 
Lódz
, but m y 
brother remained in 
Germany
 because he was liberated by the Ameri cans, and that

was German territory. And where we were liberated was the Russian territory, 
because 
England
, 
Russia
, everybody took a p Œ 
a 
Œ a part of, I think the country. 

Shortly after I was reunited with m y sister, because knowi ng Œ she probably 

checked the l ist where she was, I checked t he list where I was, and we got reunited, 

so I was with m y sister shortly after. 
Q: Is this still in 
Lódz
, are you 
Œ  
A: And that was still in 
Lódz
, yes, and we couldn™t get in touch with my brother, 
but people who I don™t know what  Œ the y were not sick, or they were hiding, used to 

com 
Œ communicate, go places. So we sent the message, through this person, to m y 

brother, who was in 
Ai nring
, near 
Feldafing
, in 
Germany
, that we both survive. 
We are only two sisters, and we survive. So he sent back a message with somebody, 

not letters, because at that ti me that was too early for mail , and it was such a mix-up 
that it™s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. That was 
the most i mportant thing. So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I 

survived and I am i n this particular place, which was 
Ai nring
,  by 
Freilassing
. If 
you could, come back t o 
Germany
, so we can be all together. Shortly, when we felt 
we can 
travel, and the t ravel wasn™t  that you took a ticket and you went on the train, 

or Œ or airplane. What Œ travel, you had to find somebody who t ook you from one 

place to another, until we reached t he border of 
Poland
 and 
Germany
, and then 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz

somebody else would Œ took us to the place where m y brother was. We Œ we Œ we 
did survive the trip, and we came back to 
G
ermany
, which nobody li ked to be in 
Germany
, but we had no other choice, because we couldn™t sta y i n pol Œ in port la Œ 
in Œ I™m sorry, in portla Œ we couldn™t sta y in 
Lódz
 because nobody was there. And 
the place which we l ived was torn down, because di Œ the place where we used t o 
live was very close to t he gates where the ghetto started in 
Lódz
. So we reunited, 
and we stayed in 
Ainri ng
, with my brot her and my sister. We stayed there from ™45 
til I came to the 
United States
 in ™49. There I met my husband, a
nd wegot married. 
My sister met her husband in the four years, and m y brot her got married. So we all 

got married in 
Germany
, and from 
Germany
, the first chance anybody had, they 
want to go away from 
Germany
. So we all registered to 
America
, to Œ to 
Canada
, 
to 
Israel
, and whichever came first, we Œ 
we went. 
 
Q: Were you in a 
DP
 camp? 
A: Yes. 
Q: All this ti me, t hese four years? 

A: All those four years, yes. Some people went to live pri vately, but we went Œ we 

were in a camp. And we were by the Americans. So m y husband registered for all 

the places which were available to go. He was a tailor, and m y si ster and her 

husband and m y brother Œ so the first to leave 
Germany
 
was my brother,because

by choice, I don™t know exactly how it worked. And he went to 
Canada
. 
And we 
were supposed to go shortly after. Then, m y si ster and her husband went to 
Israel
. 
And when the y came to 
Israel
, they came right into the war, because the y came in 

™48, from Œ from the ship, my brot her-in-law was taken t o the arm y, and my sister 

was left all by herself, and very, very sick and discouraged, because we left one 
war, and came right into another war. And I stayed on in 
Germany
, because I had a 
child. I ha Œ  I was t he first one to have a child from m y brother and sister. 
Q: But your brother and sister were older t han you, or Œ 

A: Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. My child was 

born in ™47. I married in ™46, a year later I had m y daught er. And wit h children, 

nobody was very happy t o take. 
Israel
 
di dn™t want
 anybody with children. They 

took only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to 
war with no children. And by that ti me, m y brother was already in 
Ca na da
. And he 
said, be pati ent, wai t, and I™m tryi ng to get you to 
Ca nada
. That was m y brother. 
Meanti me, there was a opening to the 
United States
. And we were very happy. At 
the ti me, it was 
HIAS
 who was working to Œ t o bring the people t o the 
United 

States
. But there was a nice family in 
Portl and
,
 Maine
, which at that  time I didn™t 

even know what 
Maine 
was, and t he y needed somebody to work in a clothing 

factory, and my husband signed up as a tailor. So, we were chosen to go to

Portland
, 
Maine
, and we were very, very happy. Came t o 
Portland
 with a two and 
a half year old child. And the man who si gned up for us to come to 
Portland
, I Œ 
was one of the nicest people. He supplied us with an apart ment. My husband was 

right away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because 

40 Œ 40 some doll ars at  Œ in Œ in ™49 was a lot of money. And we were very happy 
to be in 
America
. So m y sister wasin 
Israel
, m y brother was in 
Canada
, and I was 
in 
America
. We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. So I was 
the one who was sa ying, I™m going to start doing something. Ma ybe I can 
bring you 
to 
America
. My sister said, oh I would li ke you to come to 
Israel
, and m y brother 
said, you 
Œ  I woul d like you to be i n 
Canada
. But, it took a long ti me, and 
everybody already had settled in t he places where the y were, so m y husband didn™t 

want to leave 
Portland
, 
Maine
, and m y sister didn™t want  to leave 
Israel
, and m y 
brother didn™t want to leave 
Ca nada
, so we were all separat ed. In 
Portland
, I had a 
beautiful life. The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. Even the 

Gentile people, the y accepted us li ke we were somebody special. They came Œ the y 

was quite a few families who came to 
Portland
,butthe y didn™t sta y on,because at 

that ti me, t he peopl e who came to 
Portland
, t hey were si ngle people. And for 
single people there wasn™t really much to do in 
Portland
. And the majority left, 

after a while. But three, four Œ four families were left in 
Portland
, who had

children. And I came i n ™49, in ™51 m y Œ m y son was born in 
Portland
. And I 
already had t wo chil dren, and life was beautiful. And I real ized what a beautiful 

place is to be in 
Ameri ca
. And as the years went by, I had another son, who was 
born in ™57, and this was that, and we were all  settled in 
Portland
. After my Œ after 
five years, my husband worked for thi
s ma
n who signed i t up for us. In gratitude, he 
didn™t want  to leave him, but he alwa ys want to be on hi s own. So, after five years, 

pay him back what this man did for us in 
Portland
, we opened a little shop for 
ourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. And I helped 

m y husband, and we were there for Œ for almost 40 years, until m y husband took 

sick, and m y husband died in 2000. After when I Œ 
and my kids, meantimegot 

married and moved away from 
Portland
. After 2000, I was left by myself, and very 

few friends in 
Portland
. I sta yed on for another year in 
Portland
, in 
Maine
, and 
m y daughter who l ived in 
Virginia
 at the ti me, said Œ and m y son sett led in 
New 

Jersey
, and already had families, and my daughter had families. They ask me, 
where do I want to go to be again t ogether? So I decide I™m gonna come near m y 

daughter. A nd near m y daughter, I didn™t want to be in a single home again, so I 

have chosen to be in 
Leisure World
, which I have no regrets, I™m very happy, and I 

made some new friends and I been living Œ it™s been nine years si nce I came to li ve

in 
Leisure World
, and I hope, God willing, that I will h
ave a few more years, and 
enjoy life in 
Leisure World
.  
Q: Can we go back a lit tle bit now, and I can ask you some quest ions? 
A: Yes, ma
™am.
 
Q: Thank you for telling me your story. When you were li berated i n ™45, you™re 20 
years old. 
A: Yes. 

Q: What di d that mean to you? Do you remember what your feelings were, to get Œ  

A: A feeling Œ it™s very hard for me to describe. Like, you take a chil d, which I was 

Œ 20 years is not a baby any more, but like you take a child who came out of the 

woods, and lost. That™s how I felt, with no parents, and before I united with my 

sister, life wasn™t worth living. And I kept on asking, why did I survive, and what 
did I do to Œ for me to survive and not others, or m y parents. It was very hard. But 
when I re Œ reunited wi th my sister and brother, then life became a l it tle better.  

Q: You were 14 years old when t he war st arted. 

A: Yes, ma™am. 

Q: So you really l ost a good part of your childhood. 

A: I had no Œ 
Ihad no, likethe ysa y now, a young 
Œ how Œ how do they call it?  
Q: You mean, the t eenage years? 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz  
 
March 1, 2010 
 
 
 
12
 
A: Teenage years. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t have teenage years. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t Œ at that ti me, I didn™t even know what that means, teenage years. 
Q:Right, yeah, yeah.
 
A: Because when we were in the ghetto, life was terrible. And thanks m y brother, 

who Œ he used to Œ I can say it now, he used to steal potat o peel, and bring it home. 

So my mother cooked i t, every da y she made something else. Some people were not 

as fortunate. But my brother was 
a 
fireman, and he Œ in the ghetto, he was Œ well, 

we were working. I was working too, in the ghetto. But I was working in a laundry 

where Œ what the German who sta yed in the ghetto, we washed the clothes for the 
Germans. And I never had done anyt hing, because I was youngest at home, but I 
quickly learned how to iron, how to fold up the shirts, how to Œ t he socks, and 

everything, because that was a special place, and not everybody was fortunate to 

work in the ghetto, in a place like t hat. So I could get a portion of a lit tle water soup, 

supposingly
, but it was more water than anything in it. But my parents worked, and 
m y sister, m y brot her worked. We all work. So that kept us ali ve. And having 

parents, that was another plus that we survive. In the ghetto, oh, I hate to go int o it, 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz  
 
March 1, 2010

but life in the ghett o was unbearable. Kids my age, very few survived. I was 
fortunate to survive because I Œ as I said it, I had m y parents. And I didn™t have 

m yself to fight every day, for that l ittle piece of bread, because m y mother used to Œ 

m y mother used to rati on. She didn™t eat. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But she gave it to us. 
Q: Yeah. Right. 

A: I Œ I don™t Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t want to talk about it. 

Q: How did you find out what happened to your parents? 

A: If you Œ 
anyb o dy 
Œ 
if
 
anybody wentto the museum,up 
Œ 
upstairs inthe museum, 
there is a cat tle train. Leaving the ghetto, we all went on those cattle t rains, 

supposingly
 that we are going to another Œ  
Q: Right. 

A: Œ place of work, bet ter circumstances, everyt hing bett er, so we all were happy to 

leave the ghetto, and to go Œ we thought we are gonna go with that train. But when 

we saw those cattle trai ns, we looked at each other, and I Œ I went t o m y father and I 

said Œ I didn™t go t o m y father, because we all stayed toget her Œ and I said, Dad, 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz  
 
March 1, 2010

what Œ what is that cattle train doing here? And he said, oh, they probably just 
staying here. And t he train for us is gonna come soon. The train for us never came, 

and we went on thi s cattle train. A night and a day after, when we em bark from t hat 

cattle train Œ  I don™t even think it took a minut e, and it was so bad, because half of 

the people probably were dead, who were in that train overnight. The smell, and 
every
body relieved t hemselves standing. You couldn™t even sit down or la y down or 
whatever. Everybody was in standing position. So, when the y opened the door, we 
were happy to run out as quick as we coul d. And the y made us to run out, but we 

stepped over other people. Mine father sai d that the best place is to be in a corner, 

because when we were on it, he direct Œ m y fat her direct us to go t o the corner, 

ma ybe there is gonna be better, so we all st a yed in the corner. But  when we came 

out, we had to kind of haul over the people who are la ying on top of each other. 
And when we reached t he outside, within a spl it of a minute, or a second, it went so 
quick, mine
 parents went one wa y, and m y sister, m y brot her went the other wa y. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Oka y, girls, women were separate, and men were separate. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the y said t hat because we want to run back to my mother™s si de, m y 

parents™ side, they said, no, no, no, they go to work. You gonna see them tonight.

So my mothersaidno, don™t 
Œ don™t go, go to work. I see you tonight . But soon 
after we walked awa y from the cattle train, we saw the people on the other side, 
which looked to us like craz y, and we thought that we came to work in a crazy 

house. And being young, I Œ I Œ I didn™t realize, I Œ we di dn™t know where we are Œ 

we are going, and we didn™t know that such a t hing exist like 
Auschwitz
. We never 
hear the word 
Auschwitz
, and that was another thing whi ch the Œ the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 
from 
Auschwitz
, which was a Jewish man, oh, I forgot his name. 
He never said the truth, where we are going. And our transport was the last one 

leaving the ghetto, except the people who were hiding, and didn™t want to go. And 

the one who were hi ding, cleaned up the ghett o. And we didn™t know about it, 

oka y? So, that was the last ti me, on that cattle train, that I saw my parents. 

Q: When your chil dren were growi ng up Œ  
A: Uh-huh?  
Q: Œ did you tell t hem your story, or did you wait? 

A: No, I di d not tell them, no, no. 

Q: Because?  

A: I Œ I Œ I was talking Œ I was telli ng m y chil dren very little, because when they 

were young, I didn™t want to tell them the trut h, because I was afraid that they might 

grow up with anti Œ anti Œ anti-Semite feeling. And I didn™t wanted that to mine

children. When the y were old enough, people used to write books. I was suggested 
to write a book too, but  I never want to talk about it, writ e about i t. So, I used to get 

them a book, and I said, read that to me. And I felt, as long it™s not their mother and 

father, it won™t hurt  them as much. But when t hey understood, they di dn™t ask any 

questions, no. And I have very intel ligent chil dren. My daughter™s a social worker. 
My son is working for the court, he is an at torney. And m y youngest son is a doctor. 
So, I did very well with my children. 

Q: When your chil dren were your age, when t hings started to get  bad, like Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ for instance, you were 14 when the war started. 

A: Yes. 

Q: When your chil dren turned 14, did that  trigger any responses i n you, when you 
looked at them and thinking well, when I was 14 Œ 
A: No, no. I was happy that I could Œ that they had everything, I coul d give them 

everything. No, no, no, I Œ I never Œ m y feeling, I never gave Œ I don™t know how to 

say it. I never expressed that. I never Œ 

Q: No, but I meant  insi de. Did you feel inside Œ 

A: I was happy that  my children di dn™t have to go through. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz

A: That I a m living in a beautiful country. And I was alwa ys hopi ng that never, 
never again would I live through any war. 

Q: Were you overprotective of your children, do you think? 

A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes. Mine children never had a babysit ter, because I didn™t trust 

anybody. Oh yes, t his I got to admit.  
Q: What were you afrai d of? What would happen if you had a babysitter? 
A: That Œ al wa ys my thought that I might come back, because I was working, but I 

tried to be home when the kids were home from school. But alwa ys my thought 

was, because in the ghetto, they used to go around and pick peopl e. So, let™s say if a 

small child was left home, and the parents were working in the ghett o, the y came 

back, and they found no child. 

Q: Right. 
A: I was protected, and I don™t want to go into the ghetto, because we were hiding, 
and it was unbearable, oka y. The ghetto life Œ I don™t Œ I don™t want t o talk about it 

too much.
 

Q: No, no, no. 

A: But overprotecti ve, yes, because I was afraid. 

Q: Something mi ght happen to them. 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz

A: That while I™m not home, something might happen. And that was for a long time 
with me.
 

Q: What di d the 
United States
 
meanto you, when you were 
Œ  
A: The world. Everythi ng. Everything. 

Q: How did you Œ 
A: Freedom. 
Q: How did you know that? 

A: Happiness. How did I know about the 
United States
? I came and live. Before, I 
didn™t know about  
America
.  

Q: Oka y. So that™s what I meant, when you were in Œ in that Œ  

A: No, I Œ 

Q: Œ you didn™t know much about  it, but you knew you wanted t o come to the 
United States
. 
A: Oh yes.  

Q: Because?  

A: Because what I knew at the ti me about

forgotten my past, though I don™t talk about it, but it™s al ways with me. 

Q: How is it always wi th you? Do you think about it every day? 

A: I Œ it™s Œ it™s always with me in a way Œ let™s say Œ I will give you an example. 
When we had that little shop in

said, do thi s, do t his, do that, we did more than the person ask for, but ask less t han 
somebody else would ask for. And we used to have customers who used to say Œ 

m y husband™s name was 
Adam
, t he y used to say, 
Adam
, is that all? You shoul d 
charge more. My husband used to sa y, I should charge nothing, because I want to 

give back to 
America
, what 
Ameri ca
 gave t o us. 
Q: Did you become more religious, less rel igious Œ 

A: No, less religious. 

Q: Because of what you went through? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Whyis that?
 
A: I don™t know, I Œ being young, I ca Œ m y m other was religious more than my 

father. Maybe because I didn™t come from a very Orthodox home, but God was 
always wit h me. And I used to sa y, to m yself, why couldn™t I have my parents? 
Why did they had t o go, the wa y they went? I alwa ys said, would be so nice if I 

could have a grave to go to. And that was with me, all the time. Oh pl ease, I can™t 

talk. 

Q: Have you been back to
 Poland
 at all? 

A: No. 

Q: Would you want to go? 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz  
 
March 1, 2010 
 
 
 
21
 
A: No. 
Q: Why not? 

A: Because the Pol es were even worse than t he Germans. In beginning, the y used to 

tr Œ we had a Œ we li ved in like Œ like in a court, you know? Houses were around, 

and we had like a janitor. He was the first one who threw stones into the house, 
when the Germans came in. No, I Œ I have no desire. That Œ 
America
 is my home. I 
grew up in 
America
. 
Q: Are there any sights toda y, or sounds or smells that you Œ 
that trigger memories 
of the past for you? If you hear something, or smel l somet hing, or see something 

that triggers a memory from the past?  

A: I Œ it™s alwa ys with me, so it™s when Œ when a holida y comes, and I remember 

m y parents.
 
Q: Mm-hm, that™s hard. 

A: That Œ 
th
-that™s Œ that™s the hardest part. 
Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did, when other people, for 

instance, who were l iving in the 
United States
, didn™t have to? 
A: No. Because now that we have so many wars since, and I sit at  the table and eat , 

and Œ and I realize that there™s so much goi ng on in the world, I don™t  blame 

an
ybody, because I cannot do anything. So I think of the people, t he y probably

couldn™t do. Maybe they could do something, but the y couldn™t stop t he war. They 
stopped the war when time came to stop the war, yes. Ma ybe they could stop it  a 

little earlier, but that™s life. No, I™m not angry. No. I think about i t, because every 

time when I watch television, and see what™s going on i n the world, I think back of 

m yself, and I say, why don™t I do something. But I can™t. But, I give to 
DACA
. I do 
everything i n mine power to help. And thank God for that. 
Q: Do you receive reparations? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And what are your feelings about that? 

A: I wish I wouldn™t, but I don™t get back what I lost. And that makes me feel better 

when I sa y to myself, I lost so much. Mone y is not everything. If I could back Œ 
b uy 
back with t he mone y, I would have. So, money is Œ is oka y, but I don™t live by the 
money. Money is not everything for me. Maybe I™m different, I don™t know. I don™t 
know. 

Q: Are you Œ well, we t alked about whether you™re more comfortable around those 

who survived the war, t han those who didn™t have to. 

A: No, I™m comfortabl e around anybody. 

Q: Do you think you™d be a different person today, than you are, if you hadn't  gone 

through what you went through? 
Here you werea yo

surviving, you know, unspeakable conditions. You must have had an inner strength. 
Do you thi nk you would be different if you weren™t tested the wa y you were tested. 

A: I Œ I don™t know, I don™t know. But one thing I know, that I™m ve
ry sensible, and 

I try to help everybody I can help. I am the first one who will Œ which people used Œ 

used to make remarks about me, I didn™t realize. Why are you doing that? And I 
say, I don™t  know, I™m doing it. But people say, oh, you didn™t have t o do that. But I 
do it. 

Q: You mean Œ you mean to help other people, is that what you mean? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. I have a little problem, I used to work for the Œ not work, 

but volunt eered for the Œ for the museum, but I have a problem wit h m y feet, which 

at the time it bothered me, but not as much, and I had to stop, because I had back 

surgery. But I always am t hinking, even at  m y age now, which I™m ol der now than Œ 
when I first came, I was so happy, because I was alwa ys thinking, what to do, what 
Œ wh Œ ho w can I pa y back? I always want t o pay back to t he beautiful  
America
. So 
they said, oh, why not volunteer for the museum? 

Q: The Hol ocaust Museum. 

A: Holocaust Museum, yes. So I said, sure, why not? So, I couldn™t do it for too 

long. 

Q: What ki nd of work did you do?

A: I Œ I was at the desk, I was Œ 
Q: Visitor services. 

A: Visitors, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I enjoyed it, and I love t o do Œ even now, I love 

to do for people. 

Q: What™s your feeling when you walk into that building? 
A: I become numb. I really cannot sa y how I feel. I went upstairs. When I saw t he 
train, i-it bothered me a little, but t hat was only once that I went upstai rs, and I 

didn™t go back there. But when I am with people, all I want to do is help people.  

Q: What were your t houghts duri ng th
e 
Eichmann
 trial? 
A: It didn™t help me personal, because I couldn™t bring back anybody. If we could 

switch, and bring back the people who were lost, probably I woul d feel good about 

it. But it Œ  as I say, I don™t think I have hate in m yself. And I™m happy about it, I 
don™t want to hate. I don™t Œ I Œ I have white friends, black friends. Everybody who 
is a 
mensch
, nice, human, I like him. I don™t care who the y are. 
Q: If you walk down the street and you hear somebody speaking i n Polish, let™s sa y, 

does that Œ does it Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ catch your ear? 

A: No, no, no. I don™t care. I don™t even want t o hear it.

Q: You don™t want  to hear it? 
A: No. 

Q: But what about  German?  

A: The same thing. But  I have never shown that Œ that bothers me. No, I wouldn™t 

be in 
Germany
 if you paid me, and I wouldn™t be in 
Pol and
 if you paid me. 
Q: So you have no desi re. 

A: No, not at all. Because 
Poland
 said, that if you come back, if you have property 

and you come back and you live in 
Poland
, you gonna have all pri vileges. I said, 
you 
have the property and everything, I don™t t hink we want to. But the Germans, 

when I get mine check, I say, it™s nothing in comparison what I l ost.  

Q: During the 60s and 70s with the civil rights movement here in t he 
United States
 
Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ did that Œ 
did you 
Œ I know you were raising young children, obviously, at the 
time Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ but this Œ you know, this was the story of people who were depri ved of their 

rights, just like you were deprived.  

A: Right, right. 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz

26
 
Q: Did you relate i n any wa y, to t he civil right s movement?  
A: Being i n 
Portland
, and just watching television, because when you watch 

something, and you™re not next to it, it™s a different feeling. At least, t his is how I 

feel, I don™t know about other people, I can onl y say about myself. I feel everybody 

should have the Œ the Œ the Œ their rights, but what you see on tel evision can only 
aggravate you, but you have no power of doing anything. And t hat word alwa ys 
bothered me. I am Œ I was powerl ess. And when I came here, and I was near the 

Wh
ite House, I said, oh someda y I™m gonna say it, what I feel. But, you know, as 
you get older, you get slower and you mell ow, and Œ and you are different person 

when you old, or when you™re young. When you™re young, you got al l that will and 

that power you think you have. But now, I™m too old. 

Q: Living in 
Portl and 
Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ where Œ 
well,let me justsa y this; many Holocaust survivorscame to 
New 
York
, you know, came to the big city Œ big cit ies. 

A: Right, right, ri ght. 

Q: So there was that grouping, but you didn™t have that in 
Portland
.  
A: No, no.  

Q: So, how did you keep your identity there, when there were not people Œ

A: I was just one of Œ of so many thousands. I wasn™t any different than anybody in 
Portland
. Everybody respect everybody. 
Ma i ne

Q: The people Œ 

A: I didn™t encount er any Œ  

Q: Œ 
any anti
-Semi tism? 
A: Œ anything. Not I. I don™t know, ma ybe it was, but not toward 
me.
 
Q: Did a lot of people ask you about your background, about your experiences? 

A: Very int elligent people used to talk about it. And most of the ti me I said, I 

respect you, but I prefer not to tal k about i t. But the y were bankers, or Œ or high 

ranking people, who understood the Holocaust  better than an average person. And if 

they want t o know, I wasn™t talking to them about it. Ma ybe it wasn™t right, but t his 

is how I am. 
Q: So you have never, i n a sense, talked publicl y, to groups, or anyt hi ng like that? 
A: No, no. I did talk here to 
Œ 
to schools. But when I came back, I 
Œ I Œ 
I was sick, 
because a few ti me
s I Œ 
Q: When you sa y here, what Œ what do you mean by here? 

A: In

A: Yes. A Œ a friend of mi ne, who lives in the same building where I am, he came 
before the war, oka y?  Her grandchildren go to schools i n 
Silv er Spri ng
, and she 
asked me, 
Helen
, would you like to come and talk to the kids, which are nine, 10 

year olds, 11 year ol ds. And I said, okay, I will. I did a few times, three or four 

times, and I came home and I said no, I™m not  gonna do i t any more. Because 
bef orehand I was tol d, don™t say it  too much, because the y are too young Œ 
Q: Young.  

A: Œ to understand. And when I st art talking, kind of goes out li ke Œ flows like 

water, and I had to t hink, oh, don™t sa y this, don™t sa y that. And it took too much out 

o f me
, so after a few ti mes I said no, I cannot do it. 
Q: What about your grandchildren, have you t alked to your grandchil dren? 

A: No. The y ask me, I answer. And the y ask very little, because they know how I 
feel.
 
Q: Painful. 
A: Yeah, how painful i t is
, yes.
 
Q: Did you have to wear a yellow star in the ghetto?  

A: Absolutely. 

Q: What i Œ was your feelings about weari ng the yellow star? 

 
Interview with Helen Schwartz  
 
March 1, 2010 
 
 
 
29
 
A: Oh, in beginni ng Œ and having parents and being the youngest  child, I Œ I Œ I felt 
different. I felt protected, I felt safe, I felt good. So the star in beginni ng was like Œ 

oh, like a little game. And ma ybe because m y parents didn™t dwell into us as much 

either. My father, there was a ti me before the y closed the ghetto, t hat you could go 

anyplace you wanted. You could leave the ghetto. And t he only place you could go 
was to 
Russia
. So m y father said, I don™t want to go to 
Russia
, they 
Œ  m y father 
was a very i ntelligent man, he spoke a few languages, and at the time I thought he is 
the smartest  in the world, but it turned out  he wasn™t as smart, because he made a 

mistake of staying on, not to go anyplace. So m y father said no, I™m not going t o the 

Russians. And we kids used to sa y, oh why not ? Anot Œ another place, excitement. 

And he sai d oh no, the Russians are not as intelligent, not  as educated as the 

Germans are. My father felt the Germans will do no harm to us, because he was 
going back before the first war, and I think the first war, the Germans were better 
than the Russians. I don™t know the history as well. And when the father said no, 

was no. 

Q: How much schooling did you have?  

A: I Œ 
like high 
Œ no, li ke Œ  
Q: Through high school?

Q: Child, yeah. 

A: Œ and didn™t want to leave the child. 
Q: Right. 
A: And m y husband was working, so he had t he priority, so I sai d, you go to ni ght 

school, and I will be okay. So I was tested from a very nice gentleman, who was a 

teacher in hi gh school, and he said the ability at the time, I had like high school. So 

I don™t know Œ I don™t know where it came from. But as little school  I had, it was in 

comparison to high school. 

Q: Back in

A: Yes. 

Q: The schooling i n

A: Oh no, no. No. And m y daughter, she picked up, being two and a half, by three Œ 
by four, she spoke perfect English. So I picked up probably from her. 

Q: Do you think the Holocaust could happen again? 

A: Ah boy, I hope it never does. But I thi nk the world learned a lesson, that no 

countrywil lallow that something li
ke that  should happen again. 
Iran

not a politi cian, but a little I™m listening t o everybody. I think he is more Œ how 

should I say? He is more mouth than Œ 

Q: Action. 

A: Œ action, yes. And it  mi ght turn out that I am right, because what m y sister t old

Q: What does it mean to you? 
A: Coming home. I loved it. I would go more times, but since I had the back 

surgery, I cannot walk. I walk, but I cannot  go to 
Israel
 without walki ng, and I 

don™t want to go i n a chairs, or Œ you know. The last ti me I was Œ I think it was i n

couple boys, two children Œ she had two boys, and she gave them away to a Pole. 

And she gave him whatever, gold or whatever, mone y. And he Œ he was supposed 
to keep the boys as non-
Jews.Andthat™s what my husband
 was al ways talking 

about. Not talking to anybody, but he alwa ys used to say, oh, I will never forget the 

scene when I saw the two boys, when the Poles brought them, when the Germans 

came to collect the kids. And he couldn™t do anything. Oka y, m y husband was

Germans. Andthey went 
Œ and the y were helping the Germans, and t hey were 
soldiers. So I had a Œ a easy ti me before the liberation, that  one of the Poles Œ and I 

knew, because I coul d hear the Pol ish language from far away. We never were close 

to anybody. And I knew, I Œ I used to sa y, oh the y speak Polish Œ
