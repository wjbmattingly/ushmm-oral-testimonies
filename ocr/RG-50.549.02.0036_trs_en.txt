Answer: Nothing? 

Q: This is one minute of silence -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- in our location.  

A: I have -- People, some of the people know 
me by four different first names. Why? How 
did it happen? When I was born, I was born in L
ithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents 
were Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish
, which was -- the name was in my  birth 
certificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish,
 began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish 
means lion. It™s a typical, Jewish sounding name
. So, when we came to China, I was three 

years old and I -- when I was about five, I went
 to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian 
language and all the other subjects. I -- I didn™t 
want to say that my  name was Labe, because 
it sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and othe
r things, I didn™t want to be outstanding. 
So when they asked me what my name is, I 
said, ﬁMy name is Lowah or Leve, which in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036

Russian means lion. That™s how I went thr
ough the Russian school. Then, when I was 17, 
my -- my father told me, said -- advised me
 -- suggested that I go to studying in a British 
school in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English 
language, which he said is important in order 
to get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So 
I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school. 
I didn™t want to tell them neither my Yiddish 
name nor my  Russian name, because it doesn™t 
sound good. So I said my  name, I became Leo, wh
ich means, in English, lion, same thing as 
the other two names. And that™s how I stayed, 
for   many, many, many years, until, in 1948, 
beginning of ‚49, we had to leave for Israel. Wh
en I came to Israel, I was drafted into the 
army  and when they asked me what my  name
 was, I said, ﬁLeo.ﬂ They said, ﬁWell, you 

have to change your name, this is not a 
Hebrew name.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou, from now on you 
will be Arie,ﬂ A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that™s the same name and that™s 

how I stayed and I said, ﬁI don™t want to ch
ange it any mo re.ﬂ When I came to America, 
Arie, my social security is Arie, my driver™s 
license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people 
suggested, ﬁGo on, change it, become Leo.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁNo. Enough of that.ﬂ I had some 
problems by the way, when I was working on my  vi
sa to come to the United States, I was in 
Tokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- 
the lady who was asking me questions, her 
name was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the Americ
an embassy, said, ﬁWhat is this, how can one 
man has to have four names?ﬂ I explained to
 her, she says, ah, they don™t -- she didn™t -- I 
said, ﬁI tell you what. I™ll bring you a letter from 
the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say 
that these four names mean the same thing 
in different languages.ﬂ That was acceptable. 
And that™s it. That™s how my name was.

Q: And yet we know you as Leo? 
A: Yeah. But I -- M-My documents
, my checks, my social secu
rity, everything, everything I 
have is Arie. 

Q: But do your -- What do your children call you? 

A: Dad. 

Q: What did your wife call you? 

A: Leo. Leo, Leo, Leo. Sometimes when -- My wife also spoke Russian, it was -- it was 

Leve [indecipherable]. 

Q: So it™s all right if I call you Leo? 

A: Of course it™s all right. 

Q: So if -- if you don™t mind, if we could just  back up a little bit and name your mother and 

even her maiden name. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And where she was from. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Your father and any brothe
rs or sisters that you had. 
A: Okay. My mother™s name was Rachel, her 
maiden name was Rachel Schwartz. She was 
from a small place somewhere in Uk -- in Bela -- 
in Belarus, in -- in -- in -- in Russia. My 
father™s name was Boris or Robert -- Boris,
 anyway, in Russian it was Boris. And my 
brother -- older brother, I have an older brother, 
his name is David. He and his family live in 
Nahariyya, Israel. My youngest sister, Sheelia, sh
e lives also in Israel, in a place called

Giv™atayim, which is near Tel Aviv. They
 have extended families, nice children, 
grandchildren, etcetera. Now, my children, yes? Rebecca -- 
Q: Before we go to your children -- 

A: My wife. 

Q: I know although you -- you left Vilna at a very early age -- 

A: Three years old. 

Q: Do you have any relatives remaining there? 

A: No, I di -- I didn™t know. I never -- we never -- ma -- my  parents never corresponded 

with anybody. 

Q: And you nev -- so you never returned to Vilna after the war? 

A: Never, oh, never, no never [indecipherable] 

Q: Okay. And now let™s go to your children. 

A: My children all were born in China. 

Q: And your wife, of course. 

A: And my wife. My wife, Rebecca, she was bor
n in -- in China also, but not in the same 
place where we lived, Shanghai. She was born in Harbing, which is another city in China. 

Her father, who -- he died very, very young. He 
was a soldier in the Ru
ssian army  and they 
lived in Siberia first, in Russia,
 then when he died, they move
d to China. And that™s where I 
met her. 

Q: She was Jewish also? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036

A: Oh yes, Russian Jewish, her background. 
Her name was Rebecca Lubarski, Interesting 
how I met her. She was a pretty young girl, a
bout 14 or so, I was 17 or 18 and during the 
high holidays -- in Shanghai at that time,
 there was no synagogue -- during the high 
holidays, the Jewish community, our older peopl
e, got together and rented an apartment 
where they conducted the prayers for the Jewi
sh high holidays, New Year and the Day of 
Atonement. And I -- I used to attend those servic
es. At that time I was already working in an 
importing firm in -- they -- they gave me a job.
 I clerk in the office to learn the business. 
They were importing from England, from Germa
ny, from Poland, textiles. Woolen textiles, 
there was a big market in China for tex
tiles. And from England they imported some 

artificial silk, printed with beautiful red flowers. And it -- it was nice red flowers and I 

rememb er it. And then when I went to these se
rvices one day, I saw a -- a young, pretty girl 
in a dress with a red -- that material that 
we imported. That was such a surprise. And I 

looked at material and I said, ﬁThat™s our materi
al.ﬂ Then I looked at her. I said to a friend 
of mine, I says, ﬁThat™s the girl I like to meet
. I think I™m going to marry her.ﬂ And I did, six 
years later. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Was a very interesting story. 

Q: Did you go over to her that day? 

A: No, no, I didn™t go with her that day, I 
met her later in a -- in a organization for young 
Jewish people. We met and then I started to ta
ke her out to the movies, etcetera, etcetera, 

etcetera. [indecipherable]

Q: You had a courtship for -- 
A: Oh yes, for a long time, about six years. 

Q: Six year courtship, wow. 

A: I was 17. Because in 1933, or ‚34 -- ‚33, th
e firm that I was working for -- that™s the 
beginning of another series of 
events which brings me to Ja
pan, you see? They send me to 
Japan in 1937, before the war. 

Q: From? 

A: China to Japan, to open an office there. 

Q: With your family? 

A: No, I wasn™t married yet. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No, wait a minute, 1936 they send me, I was 
married next year. ‚36 -- beginning of 1936, 
I went to Japan. I got married later in 1936, 
came back to Shanghai, married and took my  
wife to -- with me to Japan. The reason why th
e-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it 
was a different Japan in those days, they star
ted copying the British and the French textiles. 
They used to get samp les from overseas and copy 
them in the Japanese factories and prices 
were much cheaper, so they sa
id, ﬁWe want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an 
office.ﬂ I was only what wa -- what was it, ‚36?
 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I 
decided I have to learn Japanese because I™m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get 

samp les, which I would bring to different 
manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I 
would export this merchandise to China. And then
 that was -- that was that period, that was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
8
 
 
 
‚36, then my  -- my  -- we corresponded with my
 girlfriend -- my  -- my  Rebecca and then she 
said, ﬁWell, it™s about time we got married.ﬂ 
Whatever. So I came back to Shanghai, got 
married, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and 
continued with my  job. In 1937, after nine 
months of marriage, my  son was born. Now,
 my  wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was 
very concerned to give birth in Japan, she 
didn™t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she 
was used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, ﬁI™m going 
to go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child
.ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, if that™s the way you feel,ﬂ I 
wa -- she was afraid, I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ I send he
r to Japan and there our es -- our son is -- 
early in 1937, March 29th, was born. She was in
 Shanghai, I was in Japan. And that™s -- 
And that comes another very interesting cycle in
 my life. Always in ways, my life is cycles. 
I was -- Because that brings me to -- to
 the Fuguclan. You know the book Fuguclan, you 
read it, didn™t you? Oh, the story of the jap -- of
 the Jewish refugees in Japan, what I was 
doing there. You know about that, don™t you?
 If not, there is an article here. 
Q: I want you to -- to tell about it here. 

A: Well, we™ll come back to th is. I used to go to a small rest
aurant to eat over there, in 
Kovay, in Japan, 1937. And I needly -- I knew mo s
tly all the foreigners that live at that time 
in Kovay, was a small city. Small, foreigne
r communities, some British, some American, 

some Germans, etcetera, etcetera. And I kne
w by face and by acquaintance, mo stly all of 
them. I belong to the clubs, you know. So, I used
 to go to the small Japanese restaurant 
called Kovay kitchen. And I was there, one da
y I see new faces. Never seen these people 
before in my life, they are in Japan. It really
 was very rare that foreigners would come in

those days, first of all. In those days you 
had no planes, you had to go by boat and as -- it 
was -- 
Q: Was there a Jewish community in Kovay? 

A: A very small Jewish community which was 
established in 1939, two years later, I™ll tell 
you about this. 

Q: But not when you came? 

A: Not when I came. 

Q: Okay. 

A: There was a synagogue wh-which I atte nded. I used to be quite religious. 

Q: There was a synagogue when you came? 

A: But not -- You see -- You know what the As
hkenazian Jews are and the Sephardic Jews 
are? There were about 50 Sephardic Jewish c
on -- Jewish people living in Japan in those 
days, in Kovay. Jews from Iraq, Egypt, Syria,
 Lebanon, North Africa, and a very few our 
people, which we call Ashkenazi Jews. You 
know, some Russian -- mo stly Russian Jews. 
And we didn™t get organized -- we used to -- I us
ed to go to their -- to 
the -- to the Sephardic 
synagogue every Friday. They were organized bette
r than we there, because we were -- very 
few of us. Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in 
that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new 
faces. I sat not far from them and as I was liste
ning to their conversation, they were talking 
among themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare
 thing. I got very surprised, and very 
excited, I came up to them. I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, ﬁWhat do you doing here, 

what are you doing here?ﬂ They said, ﬁWell, we 
came here to open an office. We are from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036

Panama. We have an office in Panama.ﬂ 
They™re exrom -- origin
ally from Romania. 
They™re now in Panama and interesting again. You know the name Cura
ao of course, the 
visas that [indecipherable]. Th
ey had an office in Cura
ao, they had an office in Panama. 
And they were going to open an office becau
se they were starting to buy a lot of 
merchandise. Business was really good over there.
 I said, ﬁYou™re going to open an office, 
what -- do you speak Japanese?ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁDo you speak English?ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁHow are you 
going to operate an office?ﬂ ﬁWe speak Spanish,
 and of course, Yiddish.ﬂ I said, ﬁLook, I 
can speak Japanese, I can speak 
English. I will help you to open an office, to hire people.ﬂ 
ﬁOh.ﬂ We™ll -- Became good friends. I was not -- 
not busy. We became very, very friendly 
and I helped them to establish an office. Of 
course, I didn™t want -- they offered me some 

money, I -- I refused. And we became very clos
e friends. Three months later -- I think it was 

three months later, yeah, May, my wife sends 
me this -- a telegram, ﬁI™m coming home with 
my  s -- with our son.ﬂ That™s fine. So I came to the boys, I said, ﬁLook, no mo re going 

around the nighttime to the nightclubs and th
en doing things which we were doing, young 
fellows. My wife is coming home with my  s
on. Goodbye, good luck.ﬂ My wife came and I 
didn™t see them any mo re, from 1937 to 1939. In 1939, my  firm transla -- transferred me 

back to Shanghai, with my  son, my  wife, went 
to Shanghai. He was three years old, went to 
Shanghai and I was working there, in the offi
ce in Shanghai and one day I have a telephone 
call. The guy speaks to me o-on the telephone, he
 speaks to me Yiddish. I said, ﬁWho are 
you?ﬂ He said, ﬁDon™t you rememb er me, we 
-- y-you -- we were in Japan, we went 
together. My name is Max.ﬂ ﬁOh, how ar
e you Max? What are you doing in Shanghai?ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
11
 
 
 
You know, in those days, this was not so si
mp le. You couldn™t fly by planes, 30 days by 
boat. It was -- It was a different wor-world. He
 says, ﬁLook, I™m here already three days and 
I -- I would like you and your wife to come. I™m in
 the Park Hotel,ﬂ which is one of the best 
hotels, ﬁI™m here buying merchandise,ﬂ which 
he was shipping to -- somebody shipping to -
- to - -to Panama, to Cura
ao, ﬁand I want to talk to you.ﬂ ﬁOkay.ﬂ ﬁCome with your wife.ﬂ I 
say, ﬁOkay.ﬂ Came with my  wife, I [indecipherable] long talk, talk, talk. He says to me, 
ﬁYou rememb er there were three of us when 
you met us in -- in Kovay?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ 
ﬁWell, the third guy who was with us, was my  c
ousin. He was managing our office in Japan. 
He was having a hard time, he didn™t know a
ny English, he didn™t know any Japanese and 
he decided to go out on his own, to make hi
s own business. We need somebody to run our 
office. Would you like to come and work with us
 in Japan?ﬂ 1939. War in Europe just -- just 
-- just started. I said, ﬁI™m not -- I have a 
good job here, I™m not intention -- I have a small 
baby.ﬂ So he smiled. Max was his name. He wa
s about 20 years older than I was, a mo re 
seasoned guy. 

Q: His last name? 

A: Max -- Max Becker. 

Q: Becker, okay. 

A: He puts his hand in his pocket, like this, I 
rememb er, in his pocket inside his jacket. He 
takes out a paper. It was an agreement, made
 by a lawyer, with me. He knew so well that 

I™m not going to refuse his offer. When I opened 
the agreement, I -- I -- I couldn™t believe it. 
It was about five times as mu ch money as 
I was making. It was tremendous offer, I got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
12
 
 
 
excited. Besides, all may -- sou -- may -- my e
xpe-expenses in Japan, paid by the office. A 
car and a driver and a cook and the apartment,
 everything, beautiful. I said, ﬁShake.ﬂ He 
says, ﬁOne condition. I™ll shake hands with you,
 cause you see, this a contract between me 
and you.ﬂ I say, ﬁYes, what is the c
ondition?ﬂ ﬁCan you write Yiddish? All our 
correspondence has to be in Yiddish, becau
se we don™t know English, we don™t know 
Russian, we don™t know Japanese, you don™t know 
Spanish. So there is only one way we 
can correspond, Yiddish.ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, I know
 how to translate.ﬂ ﬁYou got a job.ﬂ And 
three months later, I left my  other job,
 I took my  wife, my  son, Kobe. Kobe -- 
Q: That was you -- you went to Kobe now? 
A: That was in 1939. That™s the time -- you que
stioned about the Jewish community, we got 
organized in 1940 or so. I am working for Max,
 he™s teaching me buying, really tremendous 
amount of merchandise. Had about 20 Japanese, 
an office and -- was a beautiful job, easy, 
but responsible situation. The name of the firm was Cura
ao - Panama Trading Comp any, 
because there was -- we were shipping goods to Panama, to Cura
ao, to Peru, to Chile. 
South American countries with [indecipherabl
e] everywhere. You know, it was a different 
Japan in those days, it was not a -- the time of 
wa -- Japanese radios, television sets, cars, 
etcetera. It was toys and textiles and shoes 
and -- and underwear and -- and -- and blankets 
and tablecloths. All those things we were shi
pping there. And he says, ﬁI™ll stay with you 
two months, I™ll teach you.ﬂ Of course, I didn™t -- I didn™t know that merchandise, the 

pricing and everything. He stayed with me 
and that was the time, beginning of 1940, when 
the refugees -- the story of the refugees 
you know, they were coming with the Japanese 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
13
 
 
 
transit visas, started to come in. So, my  good friend -- later, I was working for him in Japan, 
Mr. Ponvy, he was there. 

Q: You worked for Mr. Ponvy and the same comp any? 

A: Yes -- na -- at that time, no. I worked for P
onvy after the war. In ‚51, I came to -- back to 
Tokyo, that™s another story. He was a very fine
 man, a leader, an organizer. And one day he 
came to me on a Sunday. H-H-He needed a secret ary in a Jewish community to -- of course, 

he didn™t know any  English correspondence wh
ere we thought our organization, he says 
we™re going to get organized. 

Q: Where was he from? 

A: He was born in Russia. His name was Poni
vairski. In 1941, beginning before the war, he 
emigrated to the United States and he cha
nged his name from Ponivairski to Ponvi. Mr. 
Ponvi -- Anatole was his first name -- was a w
onderful man. A real leader, a real organizer 
and I was his secretary. I mean, not paid of 
course, just in the community. He says, ﬁWe 
have to organize the Jewish community.ﬂ Ther
e were about 20 our people, Russian speaking 
Jews. We made a meeting, we got together, 
we organized. [indecipherable] organize, the 
first thing to do, you have to rent a place -- a 
place of worship. That™s the first thing you do, 
and have an office. We™ve got to organize. 
Ponvi, he organized every -- he was a wonderful 
man. I think one day, on a Sunday, I rememb er, he was -- he came to my  house with a 

telegram in his hand in English. This wa
s the first telegram signed by six names from 
Lithuania -- from Kalmus, Lithuania. Germ
an sounding names. ﬁWe German Jews in 
Kalmus, Lithuania need Japanese transit visas.
 We are on our way to Argentina. The consul 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
14
 
 
 
here told us --ﬂ the consul was this man, Suki
hara, ﬁtold us that we can -- he -- he can give 
us transit visas if Jewish community in Kobe
 will guarantee our stay here. Financial support, 
political standing, etcetera, etcetera.ﬂ That wa
s in 1940, be -- be -- middle ‚40. So, I went 
with him into the police station. The -- We -- Th ey were taking care of all our affairs. And 

we told them, here is a telegram, we -- th
ey said, ﬁWill you guarantee?ﬂ ﬁYes, we guarantee, 
we --ﬂ We had a stamp. We -- Already we™re 
organized, had a stamp. We guarantee. These 
people came. After about two weeks or so, they 
came with Japanese transit visas, but they 
had visas -- final visas to go to Argentina. I never met these people. 

Q: Now, these would be signed by Sukihara? 

A: Yes, this -- these were the first visas Suki
hara signed. Then, the Polish situation started 
when Poland, in 1939 was invaded by Russia fro
m one side and by Germany from the other 
side. Many Jews from Poland, many from Warsaw
, Krakow and other cities escaped. They 
were afraid of the Germans, they were a
fraid of the Polish and where could they go? 
Lithuania. At that time, up north in Lithuani
a, Lithuania was an independent country. And 
where you find Jewish community there who c
ould -- who -- they knew that they would 

take care of them. And they started smuggling themselves over from oc -- places occupied 

by the Polish one side or by the German on the ot
her side. And they went -- That was before 

Germany attacked Poland -- Russia. They -- It es
caped to Lithuania. And then they started 
this Cura
ao visa story. You know the Cura
ao visas, on the strength of which, the Japanese 
consul Sukihara was giving them transit vi
sas, which we started getting telegrams, 10 
people, 20 people, 100 people. Eventually we 
brought, with those visas, over 3,000 people.

Q: Now, before we go too far, I™m trying to 
weave in your own family life, alongside the 
story of the community. 
A: Well, my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized, of 

course, I was busy. After office, I used to go th
ere and there were telegrams, letters, we had 
to -- I was the only one who could speak and 
write in English. There was correspondence, 
with Jewish organizations all over, and people 
started to come from Poland. And they knew 
-- especially the religious people -- there were
 about a thousand religi
ous people, rabbis and 
students, rabbinical students, organized in di
fferent groups. They would come for all their 
problems. They would come to me, because 
I was the only one who could understand them. 
Young as I was, they would come to me and I™
ll tell you some other stories which are very, I 
wouldn™t say comical, but interesting, because th
ey had their own problems, in spite of the 
fact they were refugees. Well, then our wome
n, our wives, including my  own Rebecca, got 
organized and they started to help the refugees
, they had children. Child
ren used to get sick, 
you had to take them to the hospitals, they 
spoke Japanese. So, they were helping them. 
Also, they started collecting clothes. So
me people came naked, nothing on them. They 
started to collect clothes and give it to them and this was -- in -- in th
e evening. Then, when 
we got organized, under Mr. Ponvi™s guidance a
nd instructions, we got together and we 
rented a home, which we came -- on the gr
ound floor was a synagogue, on top was offices 
and a kitchen. We hired some people, our wo
men taught the Japanese chefs how to make 
good food, etcetera. And we were going there almo
st every day, especially the women, to 
play Mah Jong and to play cards and that was a social --

Q: Was it kosher? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, it wa -- it wasn™t kosher. 

Q: Now -- Now, in this same time period, 
did you have mo re children? When did your 
children come? 

A: My -- The next children, my  -- my  -- my  daughter was -- was number two, was born 

during the war. I was in Shanghai already. I 
will tell you how it happened that I went back 
to Shanghai. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Now, as I told you, the firm I was work ing for, Max Becker, was Panamanian. It was a 

foreign comp any under Panamanian flag. And I us
ed to talk to Max and -- when he was t-
teaching me how to -- mainly to buy the goods and the qualities and you know, 

[indecipherable] a lot of merchandise. And he says, ﬁI™m going, you are ready. I ca -- You 

can take it over.ﬂ Then one day I said to him,
 ﬁMax, wh-where is your family, where is your 
family? Where is your father, where is your mo ther? You have any?ﬂ He says, ﬁYes.ﬂ I 

says, ﬁWhere are they?ﬂ He says to me, ﬁThey ar
e in Romania,ﬂ in Bessarabia, which is part 
of Romania. I said, ﬁMax, bring them over 
here. I mean, look what™s going on. Hitler is 
marching all over the world.ﬂ That was befo
re Russia was attacked by Germany, 1941 -- 
June of 1941. He says, ﬁMy father is an ol
der man,ﬂ I don™t know how old he was. ﬁHe™s 
very Orthodox, he lives with my  mo ther and 
my  two sisters and I asked him many times to

leave Romania, Bessarabia and to come and we
™ll work something out.ﬂ He says, ﬁWhere 
will I go? I don™t know any languages.ﬂ Shows me 
letters, he corresponds with his father, in 
Yiddish, of course. ﬁWhere shall I go? My hom
e is here, my  business is here.ﬂ ﬁWhat kind 
of business --ﬂ He was buying and selling some
 cows and -- and -- and -- and what do you 
call, sheep. And -- And I said, ﬁMax, the ground is -- is burning under the -- under the 
[indecipherable] under the legs of our people.
 They™re Jews.ﬂ He says, ﬁLook, I™m asking 
them to leave, they sa
id they can™t go.ﬂ I said, ﬁTell them to come here to Japan, same way 
the other refugees are coming. I will take car
e of them and we™ll work something out, but 
get them out.ﬂ He says, ﬁLook, I --ﬂ and he s
hows me letters he writes to them, was about 
six weeks before he left. He says to his fath
er, ﬁI still insist and I want you to leave with 
Mama and the two sisters, 15 - 16, and come here
 to Japan.ﬂ Well, so he -- His father writes 

to him, ﬁYou -- I think you ha -- mu st have gone  out of your mind. I should go to Japan, an 

Orthodox Jew like me? What am I going to do there?ﬂ You know. I said, ﬁMax, tell him, if 

he decides to leave, let me know. I don™t know how, what we -- I will do, but I will -- we™re 

bringing thousands of Polish Je
ws, we™ll bring them out somehow. And then wa -- I -- I 

don™t want to worry about what™s going to ha
ppen then. But get out from - -away from the 
Germans.ﬂ He writes the father, his father a letter, he shows me the letter. He says, ﬁIf you 

decide to leave, let Mr. Hanin know about it a
nd then he will -- he will see his way to -- to 
bring you over here.ﬂ And he left. He left back
 to Panama and I was standing there and then 
Germany attacks Russia, in 1941. Russians 
occupy Romania, which at that time was 
independent country, Bessarabia, under Soviet
 occupation. I get a telegram from Max™s

father. It™s in Yiddish, but of course, English 
letters. I™ll never forget it as long as I live. 
ﬁThe book that Max wanted to send me, I need
 it very urgently.ﬂ I understood. Well, how 
am I going to get him out of there? It
™s already under Soviet occupation. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is tape one, side B, Leo Hanin.
 -- Going to make a little diversion and -- 
A: No, you can -- you can change it. 
Q: Focus on the -- 

A: Now go back -- 

Q: -- the family life. 

A: -- we go back to -- 

Q: Second child. 

A: -- 1942, when the war started, ‚41. Have I 
told about that, I don™t rememb er? Anyway, I -
- if I repeat my self, it™s alright. During -- 1941, Decemb er the eighth, Pearl Harbor, I was in 

Kobe with my wife and my son. I was worki
ng for the Panamanian firm, I remember I told 
you. When Panama declared war on Japan, 
the military came to my office, it was a 
Panamanian, enemy firm. I was not -- I was a stateless immigrant without any documents, 

without any citizenship. I had my permit to co
me to Japan because I was working there. 
Every six months I had to renew it and it was 
no problem. My son, who was born in China, 

but also stateless. My wife was stateless pe
rson. Anyway, in 1942, when Panama declared 
war on Japan, the firm became enemy firm. 
The military came and they put stamps on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
19
 
 
 
safe, whatever merchandise I had there, whatev
er money, everything was arrested and I was 
left with-without my  payment, without money, without anything, because, you know, it was 
-- it was running. And they said, ﬁLook, you are 
not an enemy subject, but the firm  you are 
working for is enemy, so we have to -- to ta
ke these steps.ﬂ They put seals on the safe and 
whatever. And they said, ﬁYou can do what you 
want.ﬂ And that was in Decemb er of 1942. 
In February, things were getting very difficult. Food was hard to get. Everybody was 

rationed, not only foreigners, Japanese also. A
nd I remember so well there were rumors, fish 
is going to be distributed. So I remember so -- tw
ice, I got up at four in the mo rning, run to 
get in line for the fish. By the 
time my turn came at seven o™clock, no more fish. It was a 
hard time. My wife, my child, who was -- Israel 
was at that time, ‚37, three years old -- four 
years old. So, I had family at that time in Sh anghai, my  father and my  mo ther. My wife™s 

mo ther and her sister and other family memb ers 
were in Shanghai, so they wrote us letters 
coy -- thing was more or less normal, it was ju
st the beginning of the war, before Japan was 
bombed and all that. And we decided we™re going to go. I decided I have nothing -- I have 

to make a living somehow. I took my  wife , my  son, and we went to Shanghai. 

Q: And where did you live? 

A: We lived -- My sister™s -- My wife™s sister
 had a -- lived in a very large ho -- house. And 
she just -- There was for her -- her husband, who was -- he was a French guy. And she had 

rooms there and we -- she invited us to stay 
there, sharing all the expenses, whether it was 
rent and food and everything, 
and that™s where we lived. And making a living was pretty -- 
you know, it wasn™t -- jiha -- it™s hard to expl
ain, it was an open market, an open black 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
20
 
 
 
market. You could get any merchandise from th
is guy -- this guy had this, you could sell it. 
And this is how we made a living, buying, 
selling, and it was going on all right. Organized 
life was pretty good, the Jewish community wa
s pretty good and strong. We had our club, 
we had our synagogues, we had 
our libraries, hospitals. It was okay. And then my  s -- my  
daughter -- my  daughter Miriam was born in 1943, during the war. My wife said, ﬁLet™s 

have another baby.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, it™s hard, war-
time.ﬂ She wanted it. Okay, she was right. Of 
course, sh-she is the apple of my  eye now
. She is looking after me, my  daughter. The 
women are always more attachedto their fathers than th -- th-t
han the men are. My sons are 
also good to me, I™m very grateful. Anyway, Miriam was born, we call her Mimi for short, 

in 1943 and then the war was over. Then we were
 -- we just managed. There was no clothes, 
there was a little bit of a -- I don™t know if you read about, or heard about it, the -- on the -- 

Ja-Japanese were allies with Germany. Under Ge
rman influence, the Japanese military were 
probing -- were thinking of, under German infl
uence and pressure -- there were about 
20,000 Jews that escaped from Germany, Aust
ria and Poland, came to Shanghai. They 
could come there without any visas, they ju
st would came -- be-before the war, including 
the 3,000 Polish Jews that we saved, brought to 
Japan and then they came to Shanghai. And 
they -- the Japanese, under the pressure from the 
Germans, decided to take all these stateless 
Jewish Germ -- who came out in ‚37, and they 
put them in the ghetto. You heard about this? 
In Shanghai ghetto? They didn™t take us, they onl
y took those that came before -- after ‚37. 
The reason for this, I still don™t know if it -- 
60 years went by and why did the Japanese 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
21
 
 
 
hesitated to do to us what the Germans did?
 After all, the Germans were already getting 
ready for the Holocaust you see, and -- 

Q: And why -- why do you think 1937? 
How did they choose that date? 
A: Who? Why did what? 

Q: How did they choose the date, 1937? 

A: Who choose the date 1937? Oh, why the Japane 
-- because that™s -- that
™s the date when -
- when the Japanese and the Germans signe
d their military alliance, number one, and 
number two, many, many Germans, Jews and Au
strians were allowed to come openly to 
Shanghai. They came by boats and they came -- 
except those that came by Japan, that we 
took care of, you see? And they put them into ghettos, from 1943. 

Q: Okay. So we™re in ‚43 and you™re in Shanghai? 

A: Shanghai. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And that -- 

Q: And that™s where you were when -- when the war ended? 

A: I-In ‚45, when the war ended, we were in
 Shanghai, yes. And when the war was over, we 
were, of course, happy and relieved because so
me American planes bombed Shanghai. Not 
where we lived, but where the German Jews liv
ed, in the honque  Japanese areas. But that™s 
where they ja -- I thing American military 
thought, or whatever it was, I don™t know the 
reasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort. Anyway, 

a few bombs fell in those areas and they kille
d a few hundred Jewish refugees, the American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
22
 
 
 
bombs. That was one of those war stories. 
And 1945, the war was over, the Americans came 
and I had in my  mind all the time, China is a huge country. Now, there™s no mo re Japanese 
occupation, it will open up and there™ll be a lot 
of business to be done. So, I knew where my 

-- Max Becker and -- had an office in New Yo rk. I knew [indecipherable], and then five 

years went by. And I said, ﬁI™m going to write him a letter,ﬂ telling him possibilities of 

doing business in Shanghai, and I suggest that
 we send this and this and this kind of 
merchandise. 

Q: You had not been working for a comp any all this time? 

A: I was only for myself [inaudible] with my fa ther and my father was 
in the -- in the -- in 

textile retail business, he was selling people su
itlinks for wearing -- woolen textiles. So, the 
first American plane I rememb er, with Amer
ican pilots came, about 30 of them. I don™t 
rememb er -- they had a special name. They 
landed in Shanghai. We were so excited, 
Americans are here. And the Japanese were su
rrendering. We would rather they surrender to 
the Americans than to the Ch
inese, because we didn™t know what™s going to be with the 
Chinese. Communists were fighting Hatsunists, you know. Was a ver -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s 

another world. I wrote a letter to them i-in
 New York and I couldn™t mail it because there 
was no communication. So I mi -- took my  bicycl
e -- in those days, w-we all had bicycles 
because cars were not -- expensive and not ava
ilable. I pedaled to the hotel where I knew 
the American flyers were and I came in ther
e. There was a big sergeant,, I remember so 

well. ﬁHello, Sergeant.ﬂ ﬁYes, sir. What can I 
do for you?ﬂ I said, ﬁLook, here is a letter. I 
have to mail it to New York. I can read it to you 
what I write there, because it™s in a foreign 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
23
 
 
 
language,ﬂ it was in Jewish. He says, ﬁI don™t care, the war is over.ﬂ I said, ﬁI can™t mail it 
because there is no -- no mail yet, no communi
cation.ﬂ He says, ﬁWe are leaving tomorrow 
for Honolulu. I™ll mail it for you.ﬂ I said, ﬁSir, thank you, how mu ch this is?ﬂ ﬁI don™t want 

any money.ﬂ Anyway, he took the letter, I was ve
ry grateful and then about three, four 
weeks, I get a telegram from New York. Alr
eady communication started to -- excuse me -- 
and he says, ﬁ[indecipherable]  we receive
d your letter and don™t worry. We™re old friends 
and we™ll send you the merchandise and you™ll be
 all right. We™ll send you and I will give 
you credit,ﬂ and etcetera, etcetera. Anyway, to
 make a long story short, from 1946 to 1948, 

Max send me a lot of merchandise, open acc
ount. And business was fantastic. Was making 

a lot of money. Then one day, he came to ch eck out. Of course he was sending me a lot of 

merchandise, I owed them a lot of money. Of 
course, I paid everything, everything was all 
right, under control, I had papers. Well, he wa
nted to see what™s going on and I don™t blame 
him, it was his money. He came, I met him and I don™t know if I said so -- if I said that in 

the old tape, about his parents, what happe
ned to them, did I say that? You recall? 
Q: Th-They were killed. 

A: They were killed by the Nazis.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: He -- He knew about it, he came, and th
at™s another story. Anyway, business was good 
and he says -- we continued it with the business 
and he went back to Panama and I stayed in 
Shanghai and everything was going fine until the 
rumors. First of all, the Americans left. 

The Shanghai international concession in those 
days, was partly occupied by the American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
24
 
 
 
Marines, by the British army. They left. And 
we knew that the Chinese are fighting, the 
Communists and the Nationalists. And we -- The newspapers, we got information that the 
Communists were winning the war and they were
 advancing toward Shanghai. No, in 1948, 
beginning of 1948, I was working and I was conta 
-- connected with one of the refugees that 
we helped to come from -- I made quite a few 
friends in those that we helped, you see? And 
somehow, they wanted to pay me back, I think.
 One guy asked me to work for him and they 
didn™t offer me any money, of course. If they 
did, I wouldn™t have taken it. And one was -- I 
was working for him, he couldn™t speak a word of
  English, but he was a very bright man. 
And he says to me one day, ﬁThings are ge
tting worse and worse, you know, the ja -- the -- 
we hear the Communists are advancing. They
™re already in Nanking, which is six hours 
from Shanghai.ﬂ And they were all leaving. He
 comes to me and he says, ﬁWhat about you? 
Where are you going?ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t want to
 go anywhere, I like it here.ﬂ I was making 
good money, I have a wonderful apartment, my  wife, my  -- my  three children. He says, 

ﬁYou are going to go to America.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhat?ﬂ And, in my  mind -- 

Q: Who said this to you? 

A: One of the Polish refugees that I was help
ing him in doing his business, cause he didn™t 
know any English, there was -- he says to me
 -- and he -- he says, ﬁYou are going to go to 
America.ﬂ I sa -- I say, ﬁI -- I -- I™m not going to go to America, I mean, I -- I don™t want to 

go anywhere, I™m here.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou are going 
to go to America, we™re all leaving. This 
one is going to Israel, this one is going to Au
stralia, thi -- I™m going to America, I --ﬂ he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
25
 
 
 
says, ﬁCome with me.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhere?ﬂ ﬁWe 
go to the American embassy. He took me in 
this -- 

Q: What year was this? 

A: ‚48. 

Q: Okay. 

A: He took me in the car to the American
 embassy, it was still operation -- before the 
Communists occupied Shanghai and I got there 
application for a visa to go to America, 
which I filled it up and gave it to them. Then
, the Communists started advancing and we 

were all talking, what shall we do? Business 
is finished, stopped. The Chinese are fighting 
each other. What to do? 19 -- In May of 1948, th
e state of Israel was established and we 
were, of course, very happy, we were celebra
ting and then everybody™s leaving. They were -
- were -- My wife says, ﬁLeo, we -- we got to
 do something, we got to leave and -- three 
children.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhere are we going to --ﬂ 

Q: Oh wait, wait. You didn™t mention the 
third child. When -- When did he come? 
A: Oh, he was born in ‚48. 

Q: In Shanghai? 

A: In Shanghai. Yeah, in nine -- beginning of  1948. So -- And then our people got together 

and they said, ﬁWe were going to -- the state of Israel is established, we™ll -- let™s send a 

telegram to the newly established governmentthere, telling them that we would like to 

emigrate to Israel, because nowhere else we 
can go.ﬂ We were stateless people, without any 
nationality. And we send them a telegram. And 
sure enough, they send a man, by the name 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
26
 
 
 
of Mr. Yowell, he was a consul and they star
ted registering us, orga
nizing us, who wants to 
go to Israel? So, we went the first. My wife, 
my self, we went, registered ourselves and about 
800 of us got together and they send a ship
 after us, the Israeli government. It was a 
Panamanian ship, under Panamanian flag. Un
ited Nations somehow got involved with the 
state of Israel and the United States, I don™t know. Anyway -- 
Q: Rememb er th e n ame o f th e sh ip ? 

A: Yes. Wooster Victory. And we™re going, 
packed everything. And the Communists are 
still not in Shanghai, they came six months late
r. But things are terrible. Mobs of Chinese, 
hungry, no business, and demons
trations, all kind of things. I said [indecipherable] 
Q: Who was demonstrating? 

A: Chinese people. They were poor, they had nothing to eat. 

Q: Against? 

A: Against themselves, against us, against fore
igners, demonstrating. They were yelling in 
Chinese, I don™t know what they were yelling. 
Someone™s -- Banks had to close. Everything 
became very disorganized. Th
ere was -- Nobody™s in charge. 
Q: Chaos. 

A: Chaos. Nobody™s in charge. So, the Wooster Victory came and we were allowed to take 

out anything we had. I rememb er packi ng the piano and the  carpets and the -- 

Q: So, it was the United Nations that paid for the passage of everything? 

A: I think United Nations or was it Jewish or
 Jewish organizations, I don™t know. I know the 
flag was Panamanian flag with 
the -- with a -- captain was a Greek, the crew was Italian. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
27
 
 
 
was a nice ship, but one of those ellessgees that was -- became a -- that could carry people. 
800 people it was. 

Q: And the a -- the -- most of the people were of what nationality? 

A: It was the -- About 90 percent were German 
and Austrian and Polish Jews. The rest were 
us Russian Jews. And we -- we -- we 
went from that ship
, the first ship. 
Q: So you felt very lucky to have that? 

A: We were very lucky just to get out, just to
 get out. Also, another thing I had in my  mind, 
I knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy 
time, I think -- before McCarthy time, and 

I was Russian born. I wasn™t kosher, as far 
as the American government was concerned, 
because -- I also -- there was a time when I had a Soviet passport. I took out a Soviet pass -- 

because I had no papers, nothing, which 
I gave up when I came to Israel. 

Q: You™re talking about the reason that
 maybe you didn™t get a visa to America? 
A: I thought that if I stay back and become
 under Communist occupation, maybe at that 
time there will be difficulties to get a visa to 
go to America, they will ask me why. Why did 
you stay? Maybe you were symp athizing with them
. In those days, it was a different way of 
thinking. I say, ﬁWe are going.ﬂ So we came to Is
rael. It took us about 52 days in that ship, 
Wooster Victory. We couldn™t go by Suez beca
use there was war between Egypt and Israel. 
We had to go to Singapore. From Singapore th
e ship went to South Africa, Cape Town, 
West Africa, Dakar, Italy -- Italy, Marseilles, 
France. We were picked up by a Jewish ship 
by the name of Negbar, Israeli ship came and picked us up in Italy. 

Q: That™s Marseilles? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
28
 
 
 
A: In -- In Negbar, in Italy. In -- In -- What was this, na -- not in Naples. Got a city in a -- in 
Italy. I forgot. They came after us, of course. 

Q: From Israel? 

A: From Israel, a ship, and -- 

Q: So they met your ship in -- 

A: They didn™t meet the ship. We came on -- 
on the -- on the -- the -- on that United Nations 
ship, the Wooster Victory, to Italy. And we
 had to get off the ship and the Negbar was 

already waiting for us. There was -- Somehow
 there was communication between people on 
the ship and they were there. They™re waiti
ng for us. And in general -- I think it was in 
general. Anyhow, we came to Israel in 1949. 
Was it ‚49 or ‚48? I don™t rememb er. ‚49, I 
think. End of ‚48.  

Q: And may I ask you how you were treated as a refugee from China? 

A: Where? 

Q: In Israel. 

A: They -- The -- That was the time where thous
ands of thousands of 
Jews were coming to 
Israel from -- those people who were remnan
ts of the -- of the camps in Europe. 
Q: That™s [indecipherable]. 

A: Ships were coming full every day, were coming from all ar -- and it was -- it was a -- 

mo st -- now, the Israeli government that time, 
just green and new, young, they were treating 
everybody the same way and they were just say 
-- they organized certain camp s in tents by 
the thousands. They would put people over ther
e and I don™t know about the food, because I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
29
 
 
 
didn™t want to go to the camps. I had enough mone
y, I had small children. And we went to a 
hotel, stayed in the hotel and then we went 
-- I had some friends there who were there 10 
years ago, went from China to Israel as -- as
 a -- pioneers They met us, they were friends 
[indecipherable] and the guys I went to school 
with. They helped us out and I had -- as I 
said, I had the money. And stayed in a hot
el and bought a condo in Haifa and was -- took 
about three months that year it was built. And -- 
Q: So, you lived in a hotel for three months? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Mm. 

A: Expensive, but had no choice.
 And one of my  friends, he was a truck driver and he said, 
ﬁLook, I have a good idea. A lot of refugees  are coming in from Europe, from Germany, 

from Poland, fra -- those that remained alive 
and they need storage 
facilities, for they™re 
bringing with them -- they stayed a year or 
two in -- back and they were buying furniture 
and goods and machinery. And th-th-they™re co
ming in, they can™t put it into camps where 
they -- where they had the -- the -- what do you 
call it? Tents. They have to take storage 
somewhere to keep it and we will organize a 
storage company.ﬂ And trucking and storage, I 
-- I liked the idea. He says, ﬁI have a truck, 
you have the money, we™ll put it all together.ﬂ 
And we rented a hou -- a -- a ware
house and we started working. 
Q: Did you have a direct conn
ection with Zionism at all? 
A: Where? 

Q: In Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
30
 
 
 
A: Israel was -- is -- is a Jewish state, ther
e was no need. I mean, the parties, you mean? The 
-- The -- The -- The political parties in Israel? 
Q: I™m just asking a question. 

A: No, no, you know, you come to Israel, you 
are a Jew, you are an Israeli, y-you don™t 
have to become to any political, unless it comes 
to vote, you vote with this party or for that 
party. 

Q: You didn™t feel  pressured 
to be one thing or another? 

A: No, no, no, no. Nobody would -- pressured me, nobody. 

Q: Uh-huh. You had a very different experience
, I think, from -- from a lot of people, that™s 
why I™m asking this from you [indecipherable] 

A: I see. Here again, you know, it was interes
ting. My time when I was helping some of 
these Polish immigrants, Jews from Poland, when
 they came via Japan, eventually, on my  
rone road, they would -- somehow I would meet
 some of them and they never forgot how 
kind we were too them, how good we were to th
em. And one of them is instrumental, I™ll 
tell you this story in a minute. I don™t know if I to ld this already. If I did, how I -- why did I 

-- 

Q: I™ll tell you, if you did. 

A: Why did I have to leave Israel 
and go to Japan, in ‚40 -- in ‚51? 

Q: Ah well, before we leave Israel, is ther
e -- is there anything else about your personal 
experience? I know you had lots of fri
ends who helped you and you had -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
31
 
 
 
A: No, they didn™t help me, because I had th
e money and I had -- I needed contacts and -- 
and [indecipherable] by the way, when I came to 
Israel, the first thing I did, I went to the 
American embassy. And I said, ﬁI applied for 
a visa in 1948, would you please contact, and 
--ﬂ No, before I left Shanghai, I went there 
and I said, ﬁI™m leaving for Israel. Would you 
please send my file to Tel Aviv, to Israel? They
 did. I came to Tel Aviv one day after we 
came there. It was there, and they asked me
, ﬁDo you want to continue on your work on the 
visa?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ We™ll let you know, and th
at was it. I didn™t see them any more, until 
later. So -- 

Q: Before we leave Israel, I wanted to 
ask you -- I know you have a -- a strong sense and 
had a strong sense of being Jewish? 

A: Yes. 

Q: But, how about the religious aspects of your
 faith? Did this contribute to a strong sense 
of your belief, your faith? Your spiritual life?  

A: It™s a good question. I wasn™t really ve
ry religious, I mean I was what you call my  
heritage -- my  -- growing up at home, in a Jewi
sh home, big -- be -- my wife was a very for 
-- come from a very, very assimilated Russi
an family. She didn™t know anything about 
Judaism, very little. Kosher, forget about it, sh
e was not interested and I was also not so 
mu ch -- course, I knew, my  children had to ha
ve Bar Mitzvah and that I followed all the 
way through, and -- but the big holidays, I used 
to take my  wife, my  children, we go to the 
temp le. But at home, you know, in America, wh en you think about Judaism, I™m sure that 

you are aware of the fact that there are Ort
hodox Jews, Conservative Jews and Reform Jews.

In those days in Israel, there was no such a 
thing. There was Orthodox. And for me it was a 
little strange, those people with the long beards
 and the -- I didn™t believe the -- I didn™t 
believe I belonged to them, because I was -- I di
dn™t ever wear a hat and -- and I didn™t keep 
kosher at home. I know my  father would have be
en upset with me if he found out, but that 
was my  life, [indecipherable] busy. Anyway, 
in 19 -- we were working, we had that 
warehouse and wa-was making -- making a liv
ing and until in 1951, after two years 
working, ‚49, ‚50, ‚51.  

Q: Living in -- 

A: In Israel. 

Q: Where? In what? A house? A condo, you said. 

A: Haifa. No, a condo -- in a condo. Things ar
e not doing so well and I speak to my  friend, 
my -- my partner. I says to him, ﬁWe™ve got
 to do something, because we are not making 
enough for a living. He says, ﬁI tell you what we
 do, we have to go a
nd buy a truck, another 
truck. And we™ll hire a driver and things will be
 all right.ﬂ I was in charge of the warehouse, 

he was in charge of the transportation, you see? 

Q: Do you have any idea why, as you look back
 on it, why things were not going well? For 
everyone, or just for your business? 

A: It was beginning of a state that starts it to
 build itself up. And first of all, I didn™t know 
the language too well to go and get a job, you se
e, if I wanted to. I didn™t know Israel -- 
Hebrew too well at that time. Why didn™t go we
ll? The economic situation was not so very 
good and people -- it was a different -- a different
 way of living in those days. Everything

was -- food was very strictly rationed. You have
 to be a professional man in order to get a 
good job, an engineer, a doctor. I wasn™t -- I was 
a businessman. That™s why, I think. But, I 
was still hoping that things will be all right. Now,
 in the meantime, we were living in Haifa. 
In Tel Aviv -- I used to go there, about two 
hours by -- by car, once in awhile to visit with 
my  friends and so forth. And one of my  friends
, whom I helped him in Japan. Very int -- I 
have to tell you this story, I don™t know if I told
 that, but it™s a very  -- he™s responsible for 
me [indecipherable] yesterday. His name was Yaglem. 
Q: How? 

A: Yaglem, a Polish Jew. When I was in char
ge -- when I was secretary of the Jewish 
community in 1940 - ‚41, when the refugees would come in -- 

Q: In Kobe. 

A: In Kobe. The Japanese police gave us strict 
instructions that refuge
es, they allow them to 
come for two weeks, transit, but we extend it af
terwards, their visas, that they were not to 
have their documents with them in order not to 
allow them to travel if they wanted to go by 
train to another city, see? In Japan. And so, I 
had to have -- in my o
ffice, in the community, 
I had a big safe and all the documents, I -- we 
insisted when they co
me from the ship to 
surrender them, I would register them and 
I was looking through them. One day I look, 
Yaglem, Yaglem. We used to import merchandi
se from Poland from Yaglem when I was in 
Shanghai. And there he is, the same Yaglem? I don™t know. I started to check, ﬁWhere is 

Mr. Yaglem?ﬂ They said, ﬁOh, he™s -- he™s not
 on the -- this -- the community supervision, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
34
 
 
 
he™s a well-to-do man, with his wife and children. They™re in a big hotel and they are there. I 
say, ﬁI™m going to go and see him.ﬂ 

Q: This is Tel Aviv? 

A: No, that was in Japan. When they came 
to Japan, where we brought them from Poland, 
Lithuania, Poland, Japan, that was Yaglem 
among the refugees. Am I making my self clear? 
When I saw the name Yaglem, he was a refugee 
from Poland in Japan. I went to see him in 
a hotel. I came to the hotel, Oriental hotel, 
and there, I said, ﬁWhere is Mr. Yaglem?ﬂ 
ﬁThere he is.ﬂ And I see it™s a man, well-dressed, his wife, children. I came up to him. I said 

to him, ﬁA-Are you Mr. Yaglem?ﬂ He says, ﬁY
es.ﬂ I says, ﬁWhen I was in Shanghai, we 
used to go -- import goods from Yaglem.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ 
he says, ﬁthat™s my  factory. You imported 
from me.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁOh, very good.ﬂ He st
arted to cry. I said, ﬁMr. Yaglem, what™s the 
matter? What are you crying?ﬂ He said, ﬁI lost 
everything, they took my  factory away, and -
-ﬂ I said, ﬁBut look, you™re here in a hotel. Th
at means to say that you have means. You are 
on your way somewhere, I don™t know where. 
You can tell me about it and if there™s 
anything I can do to help you, with paperwor
k, with permits, just let me know. I™m the 
secretary of the Jewish community, I can he
lp you.ﬂ He s -- He™s -- We spoke and we 

became very close and he says, ﬁI need to ex
tend my visas for 10 days.ﬂ I said, ﬁGive me 
your documents and I™ll take your documents.ﬂ
 And I went and I extended it for -- for a 
whole month and I did very good. Anyway, 
I don™t know what happened. Then the war 
came. I™m talking now about 1940 -- ‚41, you see,
 when I met Yaglem in Japan. Then, he 
left. I understand he was in England during the war.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A  
Q: This is tape two, side A, of an inte
rview with Leo Hanin, 
conducted by Ginger Miles on 
January 22nd, 1999, for the United Stat
es Holocaust Memo rial Museum. 
A: Okay, now? So, when we came to Israel, in
 1949, I found out that Yaglem, whom I last 
saw in Japan in 1940 or ‚41, is also in Israel. 
I went to Tel Aviv -- it™s a small country, very 
easy to find people, I found him. When he sa
w me, he didn™t know what to do with me. 
ﬁI™m here. I have a factory, a woolen factory.
 It™s already doing well.ﬂ He says, ﬁIf there is 
anything you can do --ﬂ I said -- he says, ﬁLook, 
you helped me.ﬂ I said, ﬁOh, it™s all right, 
for -- don™t worry about it.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, no,
 you™re here. If there is anything you can do, 
you™re a refugee. I™m doing well, I™ll help you.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁFine, fine, fine.ﬂ And every month 
or so, I used to go to see him in Tel Aviv 
and we were good friends. 
He [indecipherable] his 
family. Then one day I get a telephone call fro
m him, from Tel Aviv to Haifa. He says, 
ﬁLeo?ﬂ ﬁYes?ﬂ He called me Leo. He says to me -- we spoke Russian -- he says to me, ﬁDo 

you have a partner by the name of so and so, 
Danny?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ I never told him about 
it. He says, ﬁCome [indecipherable] Tel Aviv, 
I have to talk to you about something very 
serious.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat happened?ﬂ He calls me from Haifa to Tel Aviv. If he says, I am 

going. I came. He says, ﬁLook, I have bad news
 for you.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat™s the bad news?ﬂ He 
said, ﬁDid you people buy a truck just recently
, you and your partner?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, how do 

you know?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he says, ﬁhow mu ch you pay fo
r this truck?ﬂ I said so mu ch and so 
mu ch. He says, ﬁYour partner stole from 
you 600 pounds.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhat are you talking 

about?ﬂ He says, ﬁHow mu ch did you pay for 
the truck?ﬂ I says, ﬁ3,600 pounds.ﬂ He says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
37
 
 
 
ﬁWell,ﬂ he says, ﬁI was in a cafe in Tel Av
iv and I heard three people talking between 
themselves and they mentioned your name. When
 they mentioned your name, I am there.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁLook, you™re talking about Mr. Hanin, he 
was in Japan, he helped me and the whole 
story.ﬂ He says, ﬁYes, we heard about him, that he is a fine man and all that, but this partner 
bought a truck from us for 3,000 pounds and he 
asks us to make the receipt for 3,600 
pounds.ﬂ And 600 pounds, which was a lot of mone
y. In those days I needed a hundred 
pounds for a -- living a month for the whole family. He says, ﬁYour partner is a thief. He 

stole from you 600 pounds.ﬂ My heart went down. 
I™m new in this country, just started a 
business, what am I going to do? And I went back
 home to Tel Aviv -- to Haifa, I told this 
to my  wife. ﬁWhat shall we do?ﬂ I said, ﬁI
 don™t know. I cannot work with him any mo re, 
he™s a ga -- he™s a -- he™s a thief. A partner, 
a friend.ﬂ Anyhow, to make a long story short, 
he was a smart guy. He found out that my  face
, he could read my  face if something was 
wrong. I didn™t want to talk about it, I didn™ t know what to do, until finally he says, ﬁYou 

mu st tell me what happened.ﬂ I said, ﬁDanny,
 what are you asking me questions. How mu ch 

did you pay for the truck?ﬂ He says to me
, ﬁWh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean?ﬂ I said, ﬁYou 
stole from me 600 pounds. You™re a thief.ﬂ ﬁHow do you know?ﬂ And he ran away. I ran 

after him. I said, ﬁDon™t run. Come, we™ll work
 it out, we™ll talk it out and we™ll find a way.ﬂ 
ﬁNo.ﬂ He came back, he says, ﬁDon™t tell anybody that I did that. If you tell them that I s-s-

swindled you -- some of our friends, I am 
going to report you to the police, that you 
changed some money on the black market.ﬂ Which 
I did. It was very strict in those days. I 
changed, you know, I had to live, you know [indeci
pherable]. He says, ﬁI™ll put you in jail,ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
38
 
 
 
and it was very strict. I says, ﬁYou™re not 
going to do that. You can™t do that, that™s 
blackmail.ﬂ He says, ﬁI™ll put you in jail, then.ﬂ 
I got scared. I closed the office, I ran to an 
attorney. I said, ﬁWhat shall I do?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he
 says, ﬁyou have any 
papers? You signed any 
papers with this man, your partner?ﬂ I said
, ﬁNo, we did it by sh-shaking hands, we are good 
friends.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou™re a fool. You don™t do such
 things in -- in Israel. You have to come 
to a lawyer, then you™re covered.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁI™ll see what I can do.ﬂ And in about six 
months after he ne-negotiated with him a
nd we [indecipherable], I closed the office, 

everything is finished, I™m go -- I go -- I ga -- I went and I got a job in the Israeli customs, I 

was a customs brok -- customs agen -- not a agent, emp-employee in the office in 

bookkeeping. Had nothing else to do. And the lawy
er is advancing, talking to his lawyer 
and fi-finishing. Finally, he says we have an
 offer. Calls me up and he says that, ﬁI can 
make a deal between you two. He keeps the 
truck, he gives me 600 pounds.ﬂ That was -- 
The trucks was worth 3,000 pounds. 
He™s stealing again. I said, ﬁFinish, I don™t want to 
have anything to do, my headache is -- pay 
him off, let him pay me, whatever he™s do -- 
finish.ﬂ He says, ﬁI do it.ﬂ And he gave 
me -- he signed six promissory notes, 100 pounds 
each, to cover it all up. I went to the soo -- this
 -- this promissory notes went to the bank. I 
had them discounted because I had to pay to
 the bank, I borrowed money for the truck. 
Anyway, it™s -- it™s an involved story. I™m sorry I™m giving you so many details. I hope it™s 

all right, no? 

Q: Oh, it™s good.

A: And I™m working on the customs, I -- I -- I left my  house, we went on -- to live in 
another place, a small village next -- not far fro m Haifa, because friend of mine had there a 

washing machine. He was washing clothes for other people, he wa -- six machines and they 

needed somebody to iron the clot

Q: Bookkeeping? 

A: Bookkeeping, my  --i-in Haifa -- 

Q: In Haifa? 

A: -- my  wife is working on the -- on the ironing machine. 

Q: In the Laundromat? 

A: I-In a -- We had our own place called Magale
ah, which means -- these friends of mine 
were washing and if somebody wanted their clothe
s to be also ironed, they would come to 
us and pay for it and my  wife would sit down 
at a [indecipherable] machine and ironing the 
pants and the shirts and the underp
ants, whatever. Making a living. 
Q: During that time of making a living, when
 your wife -- was she working full time in 
Israel? 

A: She was working the Magaleah in
 that -- in that ironing place. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She was helping me. 

Q: And was there a special pl

A: Well, we -- we had in a house, we -- we -- I bought a house in Haifa, in a place na -- in a 
small village next to Haifa. 

Q: So they just stayed at home? 

A: They stayed at home and my oldest son wa
s in school and my other kids were still too 
young, one was very young. Anyway, we were ma
king in disin -- decent living, wa -- kind 
of a hard. 

Q: Working hard. 

A: I wa -- I had two jobs. I was working in th
e customs and in the evening I would go to the 
post office, checking the packages and I -- I 
-- I calculated the duty, because a lot of 
packages were coming from all over the world.
 And I™m working in the customs and one 
day, this -- I got the letter from the bank that I di
scounted six promissory notes.           
Q: You what? 

A: I discounted the promissory notes I got from my  partner. I -- I gave them to the bank and 

they gave me the money against -- against 
interest, you know? Against me -- Against the 
promissory notes. And he was supposed to pay 
for these, because they were -- they were 
broken down to one per month. So I got a te
lephone call from the bank that the first one, 
which was due on February the first, or what
ever it was, it was paid. The other ones not 
paid. I see and say, ﬁI finished with the guy,
 he stole all my money.ﬂ So, I™m sitting and 
working in my  office and he comes in, my  part
ner, who I don™t -- I didn™t see him for all this 
time. He comes in with a guard, a guard brings
 him in because in customs, you had to have 
a permit to go and see [indecipherable]. He comes in
 and he says to me, he says, ﬁI paid for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
41
 
 
 
the first bill, but I™m not going to pay any 
more.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhat do you mean you don™t pay 
any mo re? We made a deal, we finished with 
it -- a lawyer.ﬂ He says, ﬁIf you say one mo re 
word, I™ll go to your boss and you™re working 
for the government now, and I will tell him 
that you changed money on the black market and 
I™ll put you in jail.ﬂ I got so mad, I was -- I 
-- I told to the guard, ﬁTake him out of here. 
I don™t want to see him any mo re.ﬂ And I don™t 
know what am I going to do. In the meantime,
 already, I am working on a permit, exit 
permit, because my friend Mr. Ponvi is in Ja
pan in 1951. He heard th
at I™m having problems 
in Israel. He send me a letter, he says, ﬁIf you wa
nt to come and work with me in Tokyo, I™ll 
have you any time. I™ll send you a visa.ﬂ But I ha
d to get an exit permit -- ‚51, my  friend, 

Mr. Ponvi, who has established a store in T
okyo, he came back from America in 1949, to 
Japan, to Tokyo, as an American citizen alrea
dy. He opened a big store on the main street in 
Tokyo, Ginza. Only a few foreign firms, Amer
ican, British, French, were allowed to import 
goods in those days. Japanese were not allowe
d yet. It was before the peace treaty was 
signed in 1955, I believe. MacArthur. And so he
 -- he needed someone to help him there 
and he -- he s -- he send me a telegram. He sa
ys, if you want to come and work for me in 
Tokyo, you™re welcome, I™ll send you a visa. Whic
h he did and I -- in ‚51 -- at the same 
time, my  youngest son, Danny was a very sick ch
ild. He had asthma. He was two years old -
- no, he was three years old already. And he 
was a  very, very sick boy and I show him to 
the doctors and the doctors said, ﬁThe climate in
 Israel, the sand, the heat, is very bad for 
him. If you don™t take him away to Switzerland 
or somewhere to breathe fresh air, he™s 
going to die here.ﬂ Well my -- my wife, myse
lf, we were very, very upset. And it so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
42
 
 
 
happened my  wife had a sister who was married to a Swiss guy and they lived in 
Switzerland. So I send a telegram, I said, ﬁLook,
 my  wife has to come to Switzerland for 

about six months while I go to Japan.ﬂ And th
ey came back and they said come on down 
and my wife and my daughter -- she took my daughter and Danny, the little guy, to 

Switzerland. She also wanted to take my  -- our 
oldest son, who was at that time ‚37, ‚47, 16 
-- fif -- 16 years old, but they wouldn™t let him l
eave, because in a years time he had to go to 
the army. That was a rule in Is
rael. So she left to Switzerland 
with the two children. I went 
to Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel st
ayed behind with my  wife™s mo ther, she looked 
after him until he had to go to the army, whic
h he did. He was in the 56 year war. He 
became an officer in the Israeli army. I came 
to Japan and there, working for Mr. Ponvi™s 
store, was Mr. s -- [indecipherable] was Mr. Sukihara. Mr. -- 

Q: This was a department store? 

A: Yes, a very large department store. Only
 foreigners who could pay in dollars were 
allowed to buy, the Japanese are not allowed, 
because that was before the peace treaty was 
signed.  

Q: And what did you do in the store? 

A: I was in charge of it -- manager.  

Q: Of the entire store? 

A: Almost. [indecipherable] boss together. Th
ey were importing textiles again and I™m a 
textile man. And I was w-watching wh-which 
goods to buy and helping with the Japanese 

stopit, talking to the American [indecipherable]
 because most of the customers were GI™s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
43
 
 
 
that was during the Korean war -- who would come on R and R from Korea to Tokyo and 
before they go to -- report to go home, they 
would huf -- we also had jewelry department 
and silks and textiles. And they would come
 and buy jewelers and textiles and pay in 
dollars. That was the only way that they were 
al -- they call is script in those days, do you 
know what a script is? There were no dollars in
 those days, the army  used to pay them in 
special papers. 

Q: And the name of the -- the department store? 

A: Ponvi. 

Q: Was Ponvi? 

A: Ponvi, Ponvi.  

Q: Oh. 

A: On Ginza, on the main street in Tokyo, very
 beautiful store. And we worked there and I 
met Sukihara over there. And I -- I -- I -- he
 spoke perfect, perfect Russian and perfect 
German and perfect English. A
nd [indecipherable] face, a very 
interesting man. And I tried, 
I tr -- He was in charge of all Japanese em
ployees, there were about 25 of them. Taxes and 
you know, relations and all that. Yeah, that™s S
ukiharason. Yeah, that™s him. A few times I 
came up to him and I said, ﬁLet™s go and have l
unch and I want you to talk to me about what 
you did. I understand you did --ﬂ He wouldn™t ta
lk to me. I pushed and I pressed, I was 
interested. I was, ﬁWell why, why did he 
do it?ﬂ Til today I don™t know why he did it. I 

don™t know. 

Q: Why he was aloof? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
44
 
 
 
A: Why he was giving those visas after he was instructed by the foreign office to stop 
giving the visas. I don™t know if you read the book,
 it™s called, ﬁIn Search of Sukihara.ﬂ Try 
and get it, it™s a very interesting story. Dr. He
la Levine made a complete research. He went 
to Japan and he spoke to his children and he
 spoke to his widow and -- very interesting 
story. And only one day, he finally, after I 
was pushing him -- he was really aloof. He was 
never friendly with his own Japanese people.
 This a -- you know, the man was a diplomat. 
The man spoke so many languages. The man -- I think what was in his mind -- he lost his 

job. 

Q: For what he did? 

A: For what he did. Why did he do it? I want
ed to find out. He told me once, I will never 
forget this, he says, ﬁIt was the finger of 
God.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ ﬁWell, I saved 
those people because I had an inspiration I mu
st save them.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ I 
says -- ﬁI -- I -- I don™t want to talk about it.
ﬂ He never, never, never talked to me about. I 
hope when they make the exhibition, I can give
 them some information which it might be of 
interest, you know? Anyway, ‚51, I am in Japan, 
I went to the Japanese -- to the American 
embassy in Japan, and said, ﬁMy file is in Te
l Aviv, bring it over here, I™m now in Tel Aviv 

-- i-in Tokyo.ﬂ A few months later I™m getting a ca
ll, ﬁYour file is here.ﬂ I went. And that 

was about three years they were asking me
 questions. It was during McCarthy times. 
Q: Who was asking you? 

A: A lady in charge, Miss Pinard was his name. She was in charge of the visa section. 

Q: In Japan. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
45
 
 
 
A: In Japan, in Tokyo. American lady a
nd they work in the American embassy. 
Q: Okay. 
A: ﬁWhy -- How come y-yo-you speak Russian?ﬂ
 I said, ﬁI was born there.ﬂ ﬁAre you a 

Communist?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁProve it to me.ﬂ You know, she was a -- well, she was doing 

her job. And Miss Pinard was her name, 
very nice lady, but I understood, it was 
[indecipherable] her job. ﬁCome again, we™ll 
talk to you again.ﬂ And again and a -- and I™m 
not in a hurry. I have a good job -- of course I -- 
my  mind is, my  son, my  oldest son is in the 
army  in Israel and then if I stay in Ja
pan with the younger children, having a har -- easy 
time, I™m making good money, a good living. When 
he™s finished with the army , I want him 
to go to college, I want him to study, and my  children also. There™s nothing to do in Japan, I 

have to go to America. Where else would 
I go to give my  children an education? 

Q: Did your family from Switzerland come back? 

A: No, no, no. My wife was in Switzerland w
ith the two younger children and then, after six 
months or so, I brought them to Japan, to st ay with me. I was working in Ponvi, she came 

with the children. We had a very easy life, ve
ry good life, very comfortable life. And finally, 

Miss Pinard, every month or so, a telephone ca
ll. ﬁMr. Hanin, I want to talk to you.ﬂ 
ﬁOkay.ﬂ ﬁAre you a Communist?ﬂ ﬁNo,ﬂ I said, 
I -- then I got a little upset, I said, ﬁMiss 

Pinard, you know, if I were a Communist and if I want to go to the States, would I tell you 

that I am a Communist? Let™s change places.ﬂ She says, ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ I said, ﬁI am

ﬁAnytime. I have a lot of good friends.ﬂ And -- 
But she says, ﬁWell, come again.ﬂ And I™m 
not in a hurry. I-I™m working, I™m still young.
 I -- I -- We™re doing all right, making good 
money, putting it away. Finally, one day, after 
this interrogation, I came to a lunch -- we 
used to get together, some of the boys, some
 business people, friends of mine, in a nice 
hotel. I came there and who comes in? Maury Sprung. Maury Sprung was a major in the 
United States Air Force during the war. After 
the war was over, he was an attorney. And, 

when the war was over and they had a -- a -- a -- 
a court case against the Japanese criminals, 
you know, military, also some of the industrialists
 were taken to be investigated and Maury 
was their attorney. And he he
lped them to get -- get off the case. And he was a good -- n-
now -- now he started his own practice. Where did I meet him? I met Maury in the 

synagogue, he was a Jewish guy. He was a ma
jor, [indecipherable] without uniform. And 
we™re sitting here with lunch and he comesin. ﬁHello, hello Maury, didn™t see you for a 

long time.ﬂ He says to me, ﬁWhat™s the matter with you, you are so upset?ﬂ I say, ﬁMaury, 

don™t talk to me.ﬂ He say, ﬁWhy?ﬂ I said, ﬁY
ou Americans, you make me sick.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁHow can you talk to me like this? What™s
 the matter with you, are you crazy?ﬂ I said, 
ﬁMaury.ﬂ ﬁWhere do you come from?ﬂ he says
 to me. ﬁI just came from the American 
embassy.ﬂ ﬁWhat were you doing in the American
 embassy?ﬂ I say, ﬁI am applying -- I am 
working on a b -- am -- on a visa to go to th
e United States, and this lady over there is 
asking me so many questions. Am I a Communist a
nd this and that.ﬂ He started to laugh. He 
says, ﬁLeo, don™t worry. I™ll take care of ever
ything. You need a good lawyer.ﬂ I say, ﬁI 
don™t need any lawyers. This is clear.ﬂ He sa
ys -- Am I repeating my self, I didn™t tell this

story. I say, ﬁMaury, I don™t want to talk about it, I™m so upset, she™s asking me all these 
questions every time.ﬂ I say, ﬁWell, she™s doing 
her job, what can I say?ﬂ He says to me, 
ﬁWait for me, I™ll let you know.ﬂ Couple of mont
hs go by, he calls me up at home -- and he 
used to come to my  house for dinner sometim
es, my  wife -- we™re very good friends. Says, 
ﬁ[indecipherable] will be in this little nightcl
ub over there, American owned nightclub. You 
come there with your wife, with Rebecca, 10 o™
clock at night and leave everything to me.ﬂ I 
say, ﬁWhat are you talking about?ﬂ He says, ﬁJust come.ﬂ I said to my  -- ﬁWell, Rebecca, 

let™s go.ﬂ We came there at 10 o™clock, he™s
 standing outside, in winter, waiting for us, 
drunk. Takes us around, brings us in, it™s dark
 little bar. And there were people sitting there, 
nobody™s in uniform. And he™s doing a lot of lega
l work for the American occupation, for 
the military, that™s what I understood. ﬁGeneral So
 and so,ﬂ he says to a guy sitting there, ﬁI 
want you to meet my  very good friend, Leo a
nd Rebecca Hanin.ﬂ [indecipherable] They™re 
all sitting there, nobody™s eating any food [inde
cipherable] party, it™s a nightclub. And 
another general, say, ﬁHow do you do, Genera
l?ﬂ And Miss Pinard is there, the lady from 
the embassy. He says, ﬁMiss Pinard, I want
 you to meet my  very good friend, Leo and 
Rebecca Hanin.ﬂ ﬁHello, Miss Pinard.ﬂ She sa
ys, ﬁOh, I know him.ﬂ And he walks away 
and she comes up to me and she says, ﬁWhy di
dn™t you tell me that you™re a friend of Mr. 
Sprung?ﬂ I said, ﬁMiss Pinard, you never asked 
me about my  friends, I have many friends. 
All you were asking me is about -- you know wh
at you were asking me.ﬂ I said, ﬁBy the 
way, we are at a nightclub, we are at a part
y, let™s go and have a 
drink and talk about 
anything else. I know you were 
doing your job, please don™t wo
rry about it.ﬂ She was upset.

But anyway, we went, we danced, we talked, so
cial. Three days later she calls me. I got the 
visa. It™s -- It™s who you know. 
Q: Even then. I -- I want to -- Before we -- 

A: And I got my  visa and we came to America. Thank God for that. 

Q: Before we leave Japan, I just wanted to
 ask you, did you ever meet Mrs. Sukihara?  
A: In ja -- In -- In Los Ange les, yes. Not in -- in Tokyo. 

Q: So that was recently? 

A: Yes, just about three years ago. 

Q: Okay, so we™ll g -- we™ll go to that later. 

A: I met his son, a young boy that time, in ‚51, w
ho used to come with his father to the store 
once in awhile. And I reminded it to him now 
and we had a big laugh over it. I told him 
which fruits he used to buy with his father, I 
used to go with them 
sometimes. Anyway, so -- 
Q: Your son was in Israel in the army. 

A: He was still in the army and -- and then, well,
 he was close to be si -- I™m in -- in the 
States, we came to the States in 1956, I got my  visa. My -- My -- My quota visa, everything 

is okay, I took my wife, my two children on a sh
ip, didn™t fly, just wanted to relax a little 
bit. We came -- 

Q: Do you rememb er the name of the ship? 

A: President Cleveland. 

Q: President Cleveland.

Q: And who was president during that time? 
A: Oh, at that time, president, who 
was president at that time? Was it -- 
Q: Eisenhower? 

A: No, Truman was gone. 

Q: Eisenhower? 

A: Eisenhower. Eisenhower. We came by Honolulu,
 by ship, I wanted to see Honolulu and 
came to here to Los Angeles. 

Q: You landed in Los Angeles? 

A: Landed in San Francisco, and then take 
a -- took a train, came to Los Angeles.  

Q: Oh. 

A: In San Francisco lived my wife™s brothe
r. He was -- came to America many, many, many 
years ago, so we stayed with him for a couple 
of days and then we took a [indecipherable] to 
Los Angeles. Friend of mine from Japan advise
d me. I meant to go to New York, because, 
you know, some -- some of my  friend were there. He says, ﬁGo to Los Angeles, it™s a new 

area, start a business importing and you know th
e importing, you have some money.ﬂ And I 
listened to him, and thank God I did. Anyway, th
en my -- my mind is all the time, I have to 
bring my older son here, because when he beco
mes 21, that was in -- he was born in ‚37 -- 
‚47, ‚57, ‚58. I™m here, I came here in 1956.
 In 1958, when he becomes 21, he™s no mo re 
under my  quota, he™s under his quota. In those da
ys it was very serious with quotas. And he 
was born in China. Chinese -- Wh
ites -- What they call it, Aryan quota was very hard to get. 
I knew if I don™t get him earlier, [indecipherabl
e] he™s 21, he will fall under Chinese quota

and then who knows. And in the meantime, he™s 
still in the army, he™s finishing up. I wrote 
him a letter, he wrote some -- he got his permits
. And, by the way, when I got my visa, I -- 
Miss Pinards, the lady in -- in Tokyo, I told he
r my son is still in Japan -- in Israel and I 
don™t know if -- I mean, it was going to be diffi
cult to get a visa. She says, ﬁWhen -- When 
the time comes for you to bring him, after he™s 
finished with the army , just let me know. I 
will take care of everything.ﬂ And she did.  
Q: Huh. 

A: She wrote a letter to somebody, I don™t know to whom. My son got a visa like this. And 

he came.  

Q: In -- 

A: We brought him here in 19 -- he was before 21.
 ‚37, ‚47, ‚58. End of ‚58 he came here 
and we as -- advised him to go to UCLA, and he 
went to UCLA and he started to work there 
and to study there and he™s a -- he™s a very, you know, because he™s my son, he™s a brilliant 

young boy. He™s a Ph.D. now, you know. He met a 
beautiful, wonderful girl, Lida. They got 
married. He graduated pharmacology in UCLA
 and our government send him -- the UCLA 

send him to Sweden to study -- research on the Alzheimer disease.  

Q: And your work for your own self, what did you -- 

A: I started importing business, because this
 is the only thing I knew. And I looked around 
the stores, there were Japanese this and Japane
se that. I know Japan, I am starting importing. 
Q: And you spoke fluent Japanese. 

A: Not fluent, but enough to -- to -- to -- to get along. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
51
 
 
 
Q: To do business. 
A: And things were not doing so well, I just didn™t know how to do business in America. I -- 

It was a -- It wa -- It™s another world, 
you know, and about two years later, I had some 
customers who used buy from me. They had a store on -- on Fifth Street an-and Broadway 

in those days. I™m talking a
bout 1961 - ‚62, a long time ago. 
Q: In Los Angeles? 

A: Los Angeles. I became good friend with them
 and they had a big store and on the Eighth 

-- Eighth and Broadway. I went to see them a
nd then I -- I got a -- things were no good. I 
got a -- a -- a -- a call from a friend of mine in New York. He says, ﬁLeo, I hear you™re 

having problems in business. I don™t know if thi
ngs -- I got a lot of friends.ﬂ I say, ﬁYes?ﬂ 
ﬁWould you like to go back to Japan and -- for 
a year? We have a special job for you.ﬂ I 
say, ﬁWhat kind of a job?ﬂ He says, ﬁWe have
 some customers that are here now. They™re 
from South America, from   Chile. They are su
rvivors of the Holocaust, Polish Jews. They 
don™t speak any language but Jewish and Spanish.
 You speak Jewish?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁThey 
come, they want to buy goods to export to Chile, 
they live in Chile, in a place called Arika,ﬂ 
which is on the border of Uruguay, I think.
 ﬁWould you like to go there and work with 
them?ﬂ I said, ﬁHow mu ch you going to pay me?ﬂ We made a deal. And I told my  wife, I 

said, ﬁHoney, I™ve go to go, that™s the only wa
y we can continue.ﬂ She says, ﬁWell, if you 
have to go, go for  a year.ﬂ And I went. A
nd I worked with these guys and -- and wi -- 
Q: And you lived again in Japan? 

A: Together with whom? No, my wife was 
here, in Los Angeles, I left  her here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
52
 
 
 
Q: No, you lived again, again. 
A: Again in ‚50. I lived in a hotel, that wa
s in 1959 and 1960, two years. And then my  mind 
is working. In ‚61, I have to become an Amer
ican citizen. Five years I have to live here. I 
have to be in -- in America in ‚61 to get my
 citizenship, that™s what I want. And I made a 
deal with my  friends. I was working for a y
ear in Tokyo with these people who were buying 
merchandise for Chile, but in ‚61, I have to go 
back to get my citizensh
ip. I want to be an 
American citizen. They said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ And one
 of my  customers were two guys who had a 
store on Eighth and Broadway and I was really 
friendly with them. I had some merchandise 
left over, I came to see them, I said, ﬁFe
llows, I™m going to Japan and I have some 
merchandise. I™ll leave it with you. When you 
sell it, pay my  wife.ﬂ It was about 17,000 
dollars worth of merchandise. They said, ﬁW
ell, what -- what do you mean you™re going to 
Japan?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I got a job.ﬂ ﬁDon™t 
go, we™ll open a store here, you™ll be -- you™ll 
[indecipherable] our partner.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, no,
 no.ﬂ I already -- I had to go, m-my  mind was 
very  -- was under terrible pressure. Anyway
, I look around their store, I see Japanese 
goods, Japanese goods, Japanese 
goods. In those days it was,
 you know, radios and tape 
recorders. I said, ﬁWhere do you buy all this
?ﬂ ﬁWell, we buy this from the guy in San 
Francisco and this from the guy in New York. 
This from the guy in Chicago.ﬂ I said, ﬁLook, 
I know in Japan where to buy all these things. 
I will save you a lot of money. I™ll buy it for 
you.ﬂ And I looked at this guy, Al was his name
 and he looks at me and I don™t think he 
trusts me. I™m telling him because I know what 
I™m going to do. He says, ﬁWell --ﬂ I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
53
 
 
 
ﬁLook, before you say yes or no, only one
 condition I™ll do it for you.ﬂ ﬁWhat™s the 
condition?ﬂ ﬁYou come to Japan.ﬂ 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B      
Q: This is tape two, side B, 
Leo Hanin. Continue the story. 
A: So he says, ﬁI™m going -- You -- You want me
 to come to Japan?ﬂ I say, ﬁYeah, you can 
save so much money, because you don™t have 
to buy from local importers. I™ll -- I™ll show 
you where to buy these goods. I know. I know Japa
n.ﬂ He says, ﬁWell.ﬂ I said, ﬁDon™t say 
well, just come to Japan and leave everythi
ng to me.ﬂ And he came. And we started a 
wonderful relationship which eventually wound up 
that I came back from Japan to America, 
to get my citizenship, which I got and they o
ffered me a job to work with them, these two 
friends of mine here, Allen and Abe, which ev entually developed to become a very large 

comp any, Lloyd™s Electronics. I was one of the directors. For 25 years I worked for them. 

My main job was developing -- I used to go to 
Japan, to Korea, to Taiwan, to Hong Kong, 
cause I knew how to deal with these people. 
And also, I used to go to South America to 
develop South American markets. Panama, Sout
h Africa, Venezuela, Chile and this was my 
job fo-for 25 years. 

Q: When -- Would you like to take a break? 

A: No, I™m fine. I™m finishing.
 Unless you have any questions. 
Q: Oh, I do. 

A: Go ahead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
54
 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: Now, ask me direct questions. 

Q: All I wanted to ask you, when you came to America, were you aware of any anti-

Semitism? 

A: No, I don™t think so, no. I -- I wasn™t exposed
 to it and I wasn™t ever -- oh, I was -- I™m -- 
I -- I™m a great reader, I read a lot of books 
and -- an-and television, watch television and 
newspapers and I knew what was going on, but I personally did not experience any anti-

Semitism. 

Q: And after the war, as you look back on -- on 
your relationships as a Jew with Japanese 
and Japan, did you know when Japanese American
 were being held in camps in the United 
States? 

A: I -- I read about it when I came here, yes.  

Q: And how did that make you feel? What did you think? 

A: I -- I -- I didn™t think it was right to put American citizens -- they were American 

citizens, that™s what bothered me, to be put 
into special camps, b
ecause they were not a 
Japanese, even though they were suspected of
 being spies and all whatever. But I felt 
legally, they were not -- they ha
d no right to do that to them. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did you know that there was talk that Japanese were symp athetic to Nazism, 

did you ever hear that? 

A: When? Which -- In which period of time? Well, they were -- 

Q: In any period. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
55
 
 
 
A: -- they were allies. The Japanese signed a -- a three [indecipherable] Japan, Italy and -- 
and Germany, they signed that -- what they ca
lled an axis arrangement, it was in 19 -- when 
was it, I think in 1938 - ‚39. That was a m
ilitary alliance signed by Japan and Germany. 
Q: Oh, but that didn™t make you -- that didn™ t bother you or you didn™t worry about their -- 

A: At that time, my thought was that this -- 
all this political and military arrangements were 
against Russia. See Japan was always -- c
onsidered herself an enemy of Russian 
communism. It was no idea it would become a P
earl Harbor situation. No, no, not -- not -- 
never enter -- came into my  mind. I -- I know th
ey admired the Ameri
cans, they liked the 
Americans. They -- They -- They  -- They emulated them and all that, but whatever they 

were doing political, I think it was all against Russia. That was my opinion. 

Q: Did you see Max Becker, once you got
 into the United States, again? 
A: Yes, I saw him in -- in Venezuela many year
s later, when I was traveling on my business, 
I went to see him in Caracas, Venezuela. He 
was there, married, with children. I don™t know 
if I told you about this story. 

Q: Yes, that -- that story was told. 

A: That™s the time I saw -- 

Q: That™s a beautiful story. [indecipherable] 

A: Beautiful story. He died. He recently di
ed. But, that was a very interesting, very 

emotional story. 

Q: And when did you wife pass away? 

A: 10 years ago, in 1988. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
56
 
 
 
Q: How? 
A: Here, in Los Angeles. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She passed away of cancer. For three year
s she was suffering with having chemotherapy 
and it was a difficult time. But -- Was a very difficult time. Still is. 

Q: What? 

A: Still is, for me a difficult time to be with her -- without her. 

Q: You didn™t -- You did not remarry? 

A: No, no. I don™t think I™ll ever, ever will. 

Q: And -- And when she passed away, did you move from your -- 

A: I sa -- We [indecipherable] in -- We lived in
 -- in Encino, in a -- in a -- in a condominium 
which we bought. Last place, rather and I stayed there for my self, by -- by my self for 

awhile, to -- 

Q: Mendacino? 

A: Encino. 

Q: Oh, Encino. 

A: For about four or five years, until my 
children started to tell me that it™s no good any 
mo re to stay alone, cooking and washing and doi
ng, in a big house. And besides, it has to do 
also with finances. I didn™t -- I wasn™t a rich
 man, but if I sell this condominium, I would 
have some money to be able to make my  ow n decisions what to do next. And I listened to

them and I™m glad I did. We moved here, in
 Woodland Hills. I am living in a retirement 
hotel. Not an old age home, a retirement hotel. 
Q: Yeah, just [indecipherable] 

A: Has about over a hundred people. Not a very in
teresting life, but at least I™m about five 
minutes away from my  daughter and her husba
nd and they™re so good to me. My daughter 

calls me every day. ﬁHello Dad, how ar
e you?ﬂ And the-they™re good people, good people. 
Q: And your grandchildren? 

A: My grandchildren of my  daughter™s side -- 
there -- there is a doctor, as I told you, and 
Eddie is on the computers, they live in Conne
cticut. My -- My grandson graduated Yale. His 
wife also graduated [indecipherable] Yale, sh
e™s also a doctor. They live in Connecticut, 
Westport, Connecticut, that™s where they are. 

Q: And -- 

A: And the other grandchildren, my  son™s gr
andchildren, Adam is working for a Compaq 
computer comp any in Houston, Texas. His 
wife is a chemist. She™s now involved in 
working for a manufacturer who makes medi
cine against that™s terrible sickness -- 

Q: AIDS? 

A: AIDS. She travels to South America, to South Africa; among people there, there™s a lot 

of AIDS. 

Q: Did your children marry Jewish? 

A: My children, yes, but one of my  grandsons, Eddie, who is with the computer, he married 

a Catholic girl. She didn™t convert, he
 didn™t convert. Good, nice people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
58
 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. So you have no strong feelings
 about that, one way or the other? 
A: I -- I -- I™m not very excitably happy about it.
 I would rather him married a Jewish girl, 
but life is life. 
Q: Tell me, why -- why do you think that™s important? 

A: Why do I think that™s important? 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Let me read you something. 

Q: All right. 

A: It™s on my  85th birthday in -- in a magazine
 printed in Tel Aviv, in Israel. ﬁLeo is a 
devoted family man. Proud, justly so, of  his children, grandchildren and great-

grandchildren. Throughout his lif
e, Leo had been a committed Jew, a leader in the Jewish 
community, a devoted friend of Israel, a generous
 person, a faithful friend. In a way, always 
ready to respond to the needs of others.ﬂ I me
an, i-it™s not a matter of -- I was not -- I told 
my -- my Eddie, my grandson that married a Cat
holic girl, a very nice girl, Michelle. And I 
told my  children, if it™s going to be a wedding 
in a -- in a -- in a church, if he™s going to 
convert, this grandpa is not coming. ﬁWhy? E
ddie will be bra -- ba -- heartbroken.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁLook, I cannot, just --ﬂ So they arranged, th
ey had an interdenominational wedding and she 
is a lovely girl and they live well together and 
that™s it. This is America, I understand. I am 
not that old-fashioned to -- to -- to -- to be 
so, how shall I say, crazily -- I understand. My 
mind is open.

Q: I wonder if your children understood what
 was happening in the Holocaust, since you 
were not directly there. Did you tell them, or -- 
A: I -- You know, the first tape that I made in -- in the mu seum -- 

Q: 1990. 

A: I played it to the children and to the gra ndchildren. There is another tape, which was 

made by the Wiesenthal Holocaust Museum, he
re. I played that also. And the children 
know. Th-They read, especially the grandchild
ren I™m talking about. They were brought up 
in -- in -- not in a very Orthodox Jewish wa
y, but you know, th-they know -- th-they know. I 
don™t know if they™re as -- as committed as I w
ould have liked them to be, but this is 
America. 

Q: And when you -- when you say, this is Am
erica, do you mean it™s a mixed bag, there™s 
all sorts of religions? 

A: We -- We -- No, I say -- That™s right, we ha
ve to be open minded, 
we have to understand 
that America, and I™m not saying this because 
I™m [indecipherable]. To me, America, there™s 
no other place in the world like America. A
nd I think I understand many things that are 

happening here good and bad. I™m not going to ta
lk about what™s going to happen, what™s 
happening today, it™s -- it™s -- has nothing to do 
with my  life. But I understand all that and 
sometimes it hurts. But sometimes I -- I have to
 say to myself, ﬁWell, this is America. 
Thank God the Jewish people in America ha
ve a good life.ﬂ There is some anti-Semitism 

here, I know. Farrakhan is here and other things
 are happening, but no country in the world 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036

has been so good, so open and so understanding,
 with all the other problems that America 
has been and for this I am grateful. 
Q: I wonder if you are a memb er of any Jewish organizations? 

A: No. 

Q: You™re very -- You™re considered a friend of Israel and -- 

Q: Well, yes, we have an organization he
re, a small organization called American Far 
Eastern Society of Southern California. All ex
-residents of China, la -- an-and already their 
children got together here. There is an organi
zation here, San Francisco, New York, Brazil, 
Hong Kong, Japan. And the main purpose is to 
get together and to make some drives and 
collect some money to help our older people w
ho are destitute out in Israel. We send it to 
them and New York sends it to them and -- 
and there is about 200 people in Israel, ex-
residents of China, Jewish people, who are 
comp letely out. They™re in old age homes and 
they are supported by us. We have to help them. 

Q: A question I™m asking everyone is, do you 
think that the founding of Israel has a 

particular, special meaning for Holocaust survivors? 

A: Yes, I think so. I think that -- of course
, I didn™t speak to many Holocaust survivors. I 
didn™t speak to them, but I read a lot about it, a
ll these stories, ﬁSchindler™s Listﬂ and all the 
other movies, etcetera, etcetera. And I think 
that many Jews, survivors of Holocaust had 
nowhere to go, only to Israel. No other c
ountry -- America accepted some, Australia 
accepted some, but mostly they 
came to Israel. And where -- where would they have gone if 

it wasn™t for the -- for -- for Israel? That™s the way I look at it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036

Q: I have a list of events that I™m also as
king people that we interview in America. If you 
will just mi -- look at it and I think that the 
thing that I heard you talk about the most was 
the era of Joseph McCarthy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And how it affected you, but I™m wondering if
 your experience as a Jew during this time, 
was as strongly -- also, did you -- were you able 
to relate it to any of these events that 
happened, mainly in America? 

A: Japanese concentra -- Japanese -- Do 
we want me to go through all of them? 
Q: Oh, just whatever you relate to, not -- not -- not all of them. 

A: Well, we spoke about Japane
se concentration camps, right? 

Q: Yes. 

A: The Cold War. The Cold War is -- was st rictly war -- Cold War between American 

demo cracy and Communism, which had to be reso
lved, there was always the danger of -- of 
-- of war, only the na -- Russians were accum ulating all these nuclears weapon -- nuclear 

weapons, with which they -- America was for th
em an enemy. That was -- That™s the way I 
looked at it. And when Soviet Russia became
 no mo re, I think -- I think it™s a good thing 

that happened. 

Q: In a -- In a -- I guess what I™m talking about is -- it -- were you -- were you directly 

affected by any of these? If not, then -- 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no -- 

Q: That™s really the --

A: The era of Joseph McCArthy and the Red scar
e. Well, the only thing I can -- I was never 
told that it was because of Joseph McCarthy™s s- situation that my visa was delayed for so 
long, but it was part of life, an ex-Russian
, speaking Russian, mu st be a Communist. You 
know, it was -- I think it was implanted in the -- in the heads of the -- of the United States 

embassy employees, tha -- to -- to -- to cro -- to
 check it out, because Rosenberg™s -- at that 
time the spies, the Jewish spies 
that were co -- there were two who were executed. It was a -
- it™s a difficult situation, whether this should 
have been or not, I cannot make my  opinion, 
because I am not -- first of all, I was not at  that time an American citizen to really 

understand what was going on.  

Q: And as far as the Civil Rights movement, 
did you have any particular identity with -- 
A: When I was here? 

Q: The way Blacks were treated in America? 

A: Well, in -- in -- in Los Angeles and where 
we lived here, we didn™t see that much anti-
Black, what do you call it, attitudes. We saw 
it on television. We saw it -- what happening 
the southern states and the marches that or
ganized by Martin Luther
 King and th-the dogs 
that were put on them and the people that 
couldn™t work, people -- Black people couldn™t 
drink water and go to the bathroom and all that 
kind of thing. It -- It -- It -- It bothered me, 
but I didn™t -- I don™t know the Black people too 
well, to really understand what™s -- what™s 
going on. Cause I think the Blacks that are in the 
south are different than what they are here. 
They™re here, they are mo re integrated, don™t you think so? It™s -- It™s a difficult problem. 

You see, I™d like to say to myself that after a
ll my experiences and all my life, that I am an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
63
 
 
 
American, but I am not, really. I co -- I couldn™
t. I wasn™t born here, I didn™t grow up here, 
and I sometimes listen to my children, to my gr
andchildren, the way they
 talk. I see they are 
Americans. I am still -- who am I? I don™t know . Russian, Jewish, Japanese, Chinese, I don™t 

know. My head is mixed up. 

Q: How many languages do you -- di
d you once and do you now speak? 
A: Five. I start with Russian, Yiddish, Englis
h, Hebrew, some Japanese and -- not fluent, 
some Chinese, not fluent. And I picked up so me German in school and when I was dealing 

with the Polish refugees, 
I picked up some Polish. 

Q: This is way back to something that you -- 
you said, which I™m very -- I think would be a 
-- a curious -- an interesting thing to know. At
 the time, you couldn™t talk about the Black 
Market, about the kind of activities -- 

A: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where, where? 

Q: When your partner threatened you. 

A: Yes, in Israel. 

Q: It was in Israel. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Could you tell me, was that a typical kind 
of under the table business that was going on? 
A: A -- A lot of people that came from abroad 
in those days, knew -- knew immigrants that 
had dollars. 

Q: American dollars? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
64
 
 
 
A: Yes, American dollars, in -- in -- not in th
eir pockets, cash, but in accounts. I™m talking 
about Jews from China. They all -- We all ha
d accounts in America, in New York, in the 
States Bank, or National City Bank, whatever 
branches they had in China. And in those 
days, if you changed the dollars at the official
 rate of Israeli exchange, you had to pay -- 
when we came, two dollars and 80 cents for 
one Israeli pound. Because Israeli pound at that 
time, was equivalent to the British pound. Two 
dollars and 80 cents. Within six months, it 
became a dollar for a dollar for a pound. In othe r words, if I change a thousand dollars, I 
used to get -- at 280, let™s say, three -- 300 pounds
, but then, if two months or three months 
later, if I change a thousand dollars, I get a 
thousand pounds, which is 
a big difference. It 
was a very, very difficult situation. 

Q: And so how did you -- How was it cons
idered Black Market, what you were -- 
A: Th-This is what we call Black Market. 
I mean, you had some people who had a lot of 
local money, cha -- Israeli money and they want
ed to transfer them into American money, 
but they couldn™t do it officially, to go to 
the bank and buy dollars, it wasn™t allowed. 
Today, you can. So, there was -- and we needed
 -- I needed pounds to -- to -- to -- to -- 
Israeli pounds to live on. So, if I would go a
nd change a hundred dollars and get Israeli 
pounds, I would give my  check on -- on -- on -- on the -- on the bank, wherever I had my  

account and he would give me the Israeli pounds, that was it. 

Q: So -- 

A: I -- I -- I -- You want me to look through this? 

Q: Yes, the -- the presidencies in pa
rticular, the different presidents -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
65
 
 
 
A: The presidents? The presidents, Truman
, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, fo -- ooh. Yes, 
what is the question? 
Q: Let™s talk about Truman. 

A: Truman? Yeah, that™s what I™m talking a
bout. We knew that Truman
 recognized, one of 
the first ones. He was the second one. The fi
rst recognition was given to Israel by the 
Russians. Then Truman recognized the state of
 Israel and promised to help. I mean, the 

president of -- the first president of -- of Is
rael, Dr. Weissman, came here and do you know -
- did you ever see the picture he brought in the 
Torah, as a picture? Did you see that? No? It 
was an interesting picture, I mean we appreci
ated that. Truman accepted it with thanks and 

congratulated him. And you know what Weissman
 told him? He says President Truman -- 
that President Truman told him, ﬁCongratula
tion Mr. President.ﬂ So President Weissman 
says to him, ﬁYou see, there is a big di
fference Mr. President Truman.ﬂ ﬁWhat™s the 
difference?ﬂ He says, ﬁYou are a presid
ent of 200 and what -- how many million 
Americans? 60 -- hundred million Americans.
 I am the president of a -- a million 
presidents.ﬂ Everybody in Israel thinks he™s
 a president. That was Truman™s story. 
Q: So Truman, you feel was -- was very supportive of the Jewish people? 

A: Y-Y-You know that -- whether it was support the Jewish people, whether it was oil 

interest, we don™t know. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Whether it™s against Russia, I don™t know, it™s 
hard to say. American politics, sometimes 
th-they -- they come connected 
-- interconnected to something else. I™m trying to learn all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
66
 
 
 
this now, especially with -- th
rough the Clinton story, to unde
rstand what™s going on. It™s -- 
It™s politics, it™s oil, it™s business. American business is business. 
Q: And before we leave, I also wanted you 
to tell me about the documentary that you™re 
going to be a part of. 

A: Well, the Israeli -- a group of Israeli, I th
ink they™re very religious people -- seems mo st 
of the refugees that brough -- were brought fro
m Japan, about 3,000 Jews, of them about a 
thousand were rabbis and -- and -- and -- and 
Yeshiva -- you know what Yeshiva is? Ha -- 
You know, rabbinical schools -- were over a thousand of them. 

Q: In Japan? 

A: Yeah, among those 3,000 Jews that we save
d. And I was involved very mu ch with -- 

with their problems, they had so many differe
nt problems, so many unworthy, I mean to 
discuss it, but they had to be solved. I don™t know
 if I ever told the story about Passover, no? 
Huh? You heard -- You heard this story. Til today I rememb er it, so -- 

Q: It™s a wonderful story. 

A: They are making now, the Israeli company, religious Jews are making a documentary 

about this. 

Q: Who is? 

A: Some group of people who are owning -- owning a documentary film. And they -- they 

send a group of people to Japan and to China, and 
before they went there,
 they talked to me 
about it, because they knew that I was invol
ved in the Jewish community. And they™re 
going to make a documentary and I told them 
a few stories about this Passover and about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
67
 
 
 
this thing. And, I don™t know if I ever told -- 
if I ever told this before, but anyway, a few 
years ago, the Sony -- do you got a Sony here? No.  
Q: This? 

A: The other -- The other NHK, the Japanese 
film company called me up from Japan, was 
about five years ago. And they said that th
ey were making a documentary on Mr. Sukihara, 
in Japan and they want to come to talk to me, 
would I talk to him? I say, ﬁYes,ﬂ I™ll be glad 
to talk to him. And they came with a young lady from Brooklyn, who spoke perfect 

Japanese, was very interesting girl. And I told
 them I speak Japanese, but I would rather -- 
ﬁYou might ask me some question,ﬂ I said, ﬁwhich
 I will not be able to explain myself so 
well, because my language is a little narrow.ﬂ So 
they ask me a lot of questions, this, that 
and the other. Finally, ﬁWhy do you think Mr. Sukiha
ra did what he did, gave visas?ﬂ I said, 
ﬁYou know something, I™m not a -- I™m a Jew, but I™m not a very Orthodox, very deeply 

religious Jews. At -- ﬁFirst of all,ﬂ I said, ﬁI want you to get it off the camera, I don™t want to 

tell you to be on the camera, what I™m going to tell you.ﬂ ﬁAll right.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou know 

why he did it? He did it because God direct
ed him to do it.ﬂ ﬁWh-Wh-What do you mean?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁYou see, he saved over a thousand 
rabbis and -- and rabbinical students and by 
doing that, the -- the Jewish story, the -- the -- th
e teaching of Torah, Jewish religion, Jewish 
Orthodox religion, has not been lost. It™s bei
ngs taught all over the world because of these 
people that remained alive. That™s why God di
d it.ﬂ ﬁAh, so.ﬂ Then they asked me a few 
question, ﬁWhat™s a Torah?ﬂ They didn™t know. So
 I have a five books of Moses in English, 
I gave it to them for a few days, they read 
it. Came back, asked me some questions. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
68
 
 
 
still believe that™s what happened. H-His -- Just
 recently I had a meeting with his son and a 
lady. They -- They wrote a book, it™s called, ﬁVis
as for Life,ﬂ did you hear about that visa? 
Q: Called what? 
A: They™re going to make a be -- a documenta
ry about Sukihara. There™s a book that was 
written by Sukihara™s son and a
nother lady, I forgot her name
, Japanese lady, which is 
called, ﬁVisas for Life.ﬂ Very interesting 
book. And they invited me a couple of times 
through some of the exhibitions they made in
 temples and other places, I would go. They 
would introduce me and this and that, because 
I met their father when he was 11. Oh, the 
questions they asked me, I was -- I was -- insi
de of me, I was laughing. You know, th-they -
- they™re -- they™re making money, they™re maki
ng a living out of him, God bl -- help them, 
I mean, I don™t care, it™s none of my  business.
 ﬁDo you think,ﬂ he asked me, Sukihara, ﬁmy 
father was pro-American or pro-German?ﬂ You 
know, Sukihara was a spy and there is no ca 
-- there is no -- there is no secret about it. He
 -- Well, you read this book, get this book. It™s 
called, ﬁIn Search of Sukihara.ﬂ  

Q: What did your -- What did you answ
er [indecipherable] to his son? 
A: I said, ﬁI don™t think he was pro-German 
and I don™t think he was pro-American.ﬂ ﬁWhat 
do you mean?ﬂ I said, ﬁHe was pro-Japanese. He was doing what the ji -- he want -- he 

thought a good Japanese should do?ﬂ ﬁWhy?ﬂ ﬁIf your
 father was alive today, and I would 
ask him this question and he would give me an
 answer, I™m sorry to tell you, I still wouldn™t 
have believed him. There™s so many thing that
 are behind it, I cannot figure it out.ﬂ Why? 
The Japanese people who were so -- in those 
days, who were so departmental. Orders are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036
 
 
69
 
 
 
orders, you know. There was no such a thing as
 argue against your bosses. His was the 
foreign minister, what™s his name there -- fo
rgot his name, the one who signed the -- the 
treaty with -- with Hitler. Japanese 
foreign minister, anyway, his boss. 
Q: Sukihara™s boss? 

A: Sukihara™s boss told him not to issue any vi
sas. I mean, they off -- the -- the -- the -- the 
telegram came -- I™d like to -- how long you going to be here? 

Q: Til Monday. 

A: I™d like you to read this book, I™m [indecipherable]  lend it to you. Can I deliver it 

somewhere? I think where [interruption] -- that™s all right. 

Q: I™d just like to know before we finish, if
 there anything else about those years of your 
experience that you™d like to say? 

A: I like to say this, that my -- my participation, whatever I did, was minuscule, it wasn™t 

very -- that very important. I-I-I-It played a certain 
part, but not in a very large scale. I say to 
this, I was in the right place at the right tim
e and I did to my  opinion, was the right thing 
what I did. I didn™t know at that time that 
the Holocaust was coming. You know, ‚40 - ‚41, 
we -- we didn™t know there was a Holocaust. 
We knew there was anti-Jewish situation in 
Germany, but you didn™t know that there would be
 such a terrible thing like a Holocaust, six 
million Jews killed in such a systematic way.
 It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this 
after the war, it was mindboggling. So if I did so
mething to help to save these few thousand 
Jews, thank God for that. That™s all I can
 say. The right place, the right time. 
Q: Thank you.
