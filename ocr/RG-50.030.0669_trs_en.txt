ERIC HEINZ BONDY
 
August 30, 2012
 
 

Question: This is a United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Mr.  Eric 
Bondy on Thursday , August 
29th -- is it?  Or 30th?
 
Answer: If I can correct you, that -- Eric is my
 -- my real name is He
inz.  Everybody calls 
me Hein z.
 
Q: Aah.
 
A: And  we will  get  to that  probably, but  
my name  was changed wh
en  I went  in the  
Army, and  from  Heinz, Heinz Kristoff Eric
h  (ph)  it was  changed to Eric  H.
 
Q: Aah.
 
A: So that if captured or some
thing it wouldn't be clear to 
the Germans that I was German 
originally.
 
Q: And was Bondy your origin al last name?
 
A: Yes.  Yes.
 
Q: Okay.  So you were born Heinz Kristoff Erich Bondy?
 
A: That's correct.
 
Q: But now today you 
are Eric H. Bondy?
 
A: Right.  And I'm called Heinz.
 
Q: And you're called Heinz. Okay .  Well, we'r e 
very grateful that you'v e agreed to speak 
with us.  I'll  repeat once  more  th at  today 
 is Thursday, August  30th,  2012.  We are at 
your home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. And I w
ill start this interview like we do with all 
 
of them. We want to find  out  a little  bit  ab out
  your  earliest memories, your  life,  your  
parents, your  family, the  world 
 that  you were  born  into. So if you, if we can start with 
a few factual details. The date you were born?
 
A: June 2nd, 1924.
 
Q: And did you have 
brothers and sisters?
 
A: I had two sisters.
 
Q: Are they older or younger?
 
A: They were both older, 
and they're both dead now.
 
Q: I see.  What were their names?
 
A: Anna Marie and Olla (ph).
 

Q: Anna Marie and Olla?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And how much olde
r were they from you?
 
A: Three years.  There were three years between each of us.
 
Q: Uh-huh. And wh ere were you born?
 
A: Where was I born? A place called Gunderstein in Germany.
 
Q: Gunderstein. And what majo
r city is that closest to?
 
A: Oh, it's probably 60 miles fro m Hamburg.
 
Q: Uh-huh. Northern  Germany?
 
A: Northern Germany. 
 
Q: Northern Germany. And how 
would you describe 
your family? What was your father's  
occupation? What was your mo ther's? Did y ou have a large extended family? Tells us 
about that.
 
A: I will  start  with  my grandfather, my fath
er's father, who  starte
d out  as a Jewish  
peddler with  a tray  around  his neck  selling st
uff  from  it,  and  he walked  from  what  
is now Czechoslovakia to Hamb
urg and  established an expo
rt/import business and  got  
very  rich  and  very  successf
ul. Fortunately, he died  before
  the  Nazis  could  take  
away  all his  money  and  his  houses. And 
 it was  really  his  money that provided my  
parents with  the  mo ney  to -- they  were
 school  people. They  always had boarding 
schools. And they got the money from my  gra
ndfather to do it.  My mo ther was one of 
the very early physicians and became a psychoa
nalyst. Sh e studied with Dr.  Freud, and 
he became friends of the family. I remember that 
 his  daughter, Anna Freud,  was  also  a 
psychoanalyst, used  to come  and  visit fre
quently and  was  a close  friend  of my  
mother  -- of my mother's. So th
at  that's  how  -- then  my
 father  had  a PhD in Art  
History, and  they  decided to
 go in to  education. They   be
lieved in what  was  then  a 
very  novel  idea  and progressi
ve idea  that  they  would have  a co-educational board ing 
school.  And  as the  school  grew,  they  move
d  from one  place  to the  other  until  they  
finally ended  up in aplace  called  Mariendahl
 (ph),  which  was  a large  school, became  
a large  school. I went to school there with 
about 200 students, and 
the school still exists 
in --
 
Q: In Gunderstein?
 
A: No, this is in -- it's also 
in Hamburg, but it's a different place. Gunderstein was  the  
second  school  they  had,  and  th en  Marien
dahl was  the  third  one.  After  that, of 

course, the  Nazis  came  in 1933,  and  my
 parents were both  Jewish, so it was  clear  
that  this  wasn 't  going  to last  very  lo ng,  and  for  a while  the  sch ool  continued 
because we had  the  Nazi  minister 
of education's daughter in the  school.
 
Q: Really?
 
A: So that --
 
Q: What was her name?  Do you rememb er?
 
A: Her father's name was Kerrl,  K-E-R-R-L. 
 I don't rememb er her name.  I was  about  
10 or 12 at that  time. And  th
en  my mother  decided that  
the  Nazis  were  going  to be 
there  for  a long  time. Well, 
 my father  thought they  we
re just  a passing problem. And  
we prepared to go to Sw
itzerland.  And  what  is all  this  growling?
 
Q: I know. I want  to interrupt just  for  a seco
nd. No, no,  no,  it's   okay. You  can  keep  
the  taping  going. Ju st to say  that  if there'
s audio  on the  tape  it has  some growling. 
We have  too  lovely  poodles who  are  guard
ing Mr.  Bo ndy,  and  we have  a choice  of 
whether or not  they   are in the  room  and  ba
rk,  or whether they're here  and  just have  
a low-level growl. So for  ambient audio  noise,
  we have preferred the  latter  choice. So 
just  to give  future people  who,  you  know,  future  listeners
, an idea  of why  the 
growling is there;  it
's   friendly growling.
 
A: Abso lutely.
 
Q: Okay.  Can  we back 
 up just  a little  bit.
 
A: Sure.
 
Q: I'd  like  to find  out  some
thing.  Do you  have  an ea
rliest memory, of what  you  
would  th ink  would  be one  
of your  earliest memo ries?
 
A: I was  a passionate soccer  player, and  
I remember p laying so ccer  in Germany. And  
once  the  Nazis  came  
in, they decided that  Jewish  kids  couldn't play  soccer. So my  
earliest, earliest memo ry  is not  being  allo
wed to play soccer  anymore, which  was  a 

great  blow  to me.
 
Q: Of course.  For  any  boy,  you  know.
 
A: {Laughter}
 
Q: Tell  us a little  bit  about  your  home  lif
e.  If your mother  was  a psychoanalyst and  

your  father  was,  had  a PhD in  Art  History you  said?
 
A: Uh-huh.
 

Q: -- and  was  involved in education, were  they
  at home often?  Did  you  have  a close  
relationship? Were  you brought up by nannies?
 
A: We were  pretty  close,  but  they  were
  running a boarding school, which  means  that  
we all  lived  in one  big dorm
itory. They  had  an 
apartment at one  end,  and  my sisters 
and  I lived  at the  other  end  of the  corridor.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: And  we had  a pretty  close  relationship.
 
Q: What  was  your  father  like?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: What  kind  of a personality
 did  your  father  have?
 
A: It's  hard  to tell.  He was  a very  plea
sant person, had a lot  of friends; very   serious 
about  education.   He was very much  affected
 by his  service in the  first  world  war. He 
was  wounded in the  first  world  war.  I gue
ss  th at 's  h o w  h e met  my  mo th er  was  
studying medicine in Vienna. And  he was  transf
erred, and  at one  point  in order  to be 
near  her joined  what  was  called  the  Came
l  Corps,  and  I guess  it was what  is today  
Palestine. Of course, one  of the  problems 
that  comes  with  
being  in a boarding 
school  is that  you share your  parents with 
 a lot  of people. Of course, we didn't  know  
any  other  -- any  -- anything else. We had  a 
Bavarian -- I guess  she  wasn 't  a nurse  -- 
caretaker, who took  care  of us while  they 
 were  busy.  All  I can  remember about  
her  is that  she  was  extremely Catho
lic, while  we were  probably extremely 
nonreligious and,  but  she  was  very ni
ce  and  stayed  with  us till  we left.
 
Q: About  the  first  w o rld  war.
 
A: Excuse  me?
 
Q: About  the  first  w o rld  war,  did  your  fa
ther  tell  you about  how  he came  to be 
wounded?
 
A: He was  an artillery officer, but  he very  
rarely  talked about  
the  war. He talked  
about  meeting my mother  and th ings like  that,  but  did  not  talk  much  about  the  war.
 
Q: About  his  experience?
 
A: One  of his  brothers was  killed  in the  war.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: And  the  two  other  brothers, who  were 
 very  successful. One  was  called  Cacord  
(ph)  who  -- I don't  know  if you're interest
ed in this  -- who  
started a school  in 

Germany fo r Jewish  immigrants, prepare them 
 for  emigration. He 
was probably wrong  
because he felt  that  th ey
  should  learn carpentry 
and  various other  things.
 
Q: I'm  listening even   as I am handing my  colleague the writing.
 
A: He was  -- the  school  -- he was  arre
sted and  put  in a concentration camp .
 
Q: The  uncle  of yours?
 
A: My uncle, yeah.  And  ev en
tually, I don't  know  how  
he escaped or was  released, 
and  walked  across  Europe  and  came to 
the  United  States  and  became  a full  
professor at William an d  Mary,  and  then  afte
r  the  war  went  back  to Germany and  
became  the  head  of 
the  Hamburg University.
 
Q: Unusual on many  counts.
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: That 's  a n  unusual destiny on many  counts.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q:  You  know,  very  few  Jews  went  back 
 to live  in Germany after  the  war,  and  to 

have  such  a prominent place  in the life 
 of a university and  the  city  is --
 
A: I remember that  he also  
when  he went  back  he wrote a -- what  you  call  those  
columns where  you  answer  pe
ople's problems in the newspaper?
 
Q: Oh, sort of an agony  
aunt.  He would do that?
 
A: Yeah, he did  that  for  years.
 
Q: Did  he enjoy  it?
 
A: I guess  so,  yeah.
 
Q: Did  you  ever  read  his  columns?
 
A: No.
 
{Laughter from  both}
 
Q: I'm  trying  to get  a sense  of how  Ge
rman  your  family was. You mentioned just 
briefly your  grandfather had  come from C
zechoslovakia, which  wasn't  Czechoslovakia 

--
 
A: No,  it wasn't.
 
Q: -- until  1918.
 

A: Well,  where  he came  from  was  what's  ca
lled  Bohemia then  and  was  part  of the  
Austrian Empire.
 
Q: Was  he German  speaking?
 
A: Oh,  yes,  yes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: He was  from  an German  area  in Bohemia.
 
Q: And  your  mother  was  from  Austria?
 
A: My mother was  born  in 
Austria. She  took  her  medical training in Czechoslovakia 
and,  but  she  was  Je wish  
and  she spoke  perfect German.
 
Q: And  do they  see  themselves
 more  German  than  Jewish?
 
A: Never  spoke  Jewish.  I never  learned Jewish.
 
Q: Never  learned Yiddish?
 
A: Yiddish, no.  Never  spoke  anything but 
 German, and later  French, and  that's  it.
 
Q: Did  you  -- when  the  Nazi
s  came  to power,  you  woul
d have  been  nine  years  
old.
 
A: In 1933,  I was  9 years  old.
 
Q: That's  young,  but  would 
 it -- young  fo r  the  question I'm  going  to ask,  but  do 
you  rememb er your  parents having discussi
ons about  the  Nazis  coming  to power?
 
A: Oh, yes,  yes.
 
Q: What  was  the  tone  of those  discussions
? Did  they  talk amongst themselves or did  
they  talk  to 
you  about  them?
 
A: Well,  they  explained antisemitism, which  
was  a very strange concept to me,  partly  
because I'd  been  brought up w
ithout any  religion and  didn't   really  realize th at  I was 
Jewish  until  I was  probably ten  years  old. 
 They  talked about  the  danger  of the  
Nazis  and  that  they  might  have  to do so
mething about  it,  leave,
  or -- and  they  -- 
my  mo ther was  a psychoanalyst, so they  be
lieved in talking to ch
ildren very  openly, 
and  so we pretty  much  knew
  by age  10 what  was  going  on.
 
Q: Do you  reme mb er how  your  sisters reac
ted? Did  you talk  amongst the  siblings 
about  this?
 
A: My oldest  si ster  w as  si
x  years  older  than  I was.
 

Q: So sh e  was  a teenager.
 
A: And  she  was  much  more  conscious wh
en  we left  Germany 
of leaving her  home  
and  leaving her,  and  she  had  about  the 
time  she  was  18,  she  was  engaged to a 
young  man  who  came with  us to Americ
a later  on,  and  she  started a school
 
also,  so --
 
Q: What  were  the  other  kids  in the  scho
ol  like  when  the Nazi
s  came  to power? Did  
you  feel  that  in the  classroom?
 
A: The  school, they   were  anti-Nazi and  very
  protective of my  parents. I don't  think  -- 
at least  that's  a long  time ago  -- I don't  thi
nk  any  of them  turned  out  to be Nazis. I 
know  that  one  or two  join
ed  the  SA in order  to prot
ect the  school, but  we didn't   
really  run  into  Nazis  un
til probably 1935  when  the  St
ate  started appointing teachers 
to the  school, and  they  were  of course  Nazis.
 
Q: You  said  this  was  a private school?
 
A: Yes,  it was.
 
Q: Okay.  And  it was  largely funded  by 
the  money  your grandfather had  earned?
 
A: Well,  yeah,  until  the  school  star
ted, and  then  it was funded  by tuition.
 
Q: Yeah. And  you  said  he died  before  his  --
 
A: He died  before  -- I think  he died  in 1933,  which  wa
s just  the beginning of the  
Nazi  time  in Germany, and  th
ey did  not  -- any  Jewish  pus
h  did  not  start  until  one  
or two years  later.
 
Q: Let's  back  up a little  bit  later. I di
dn't realize you  knew  him.  What  kind  of 
relationship did  you  have 
 with your  grandfather?
 
A: Very  little.  He died  when  I was  nine  
or 10.  I knew he had  a beautiful house  in 
Hamburg, as we visited occasionally, and 
 my mo th er 's mo th er
  -- my original 
grandfather was  blind  and  died   early.
 
Q: Your  maternal grandfather?
 
A: My maternal grandfather.  She  remarried a
nd  even tually died  in Theresienstadt, both  
she  and  her  husband.
 
Q: Your  grandparents, Your  step
-grandfather and  your grandmother?
 
A: And  my  grandmother, yeah.  I had  -- it was 
 amazing, I had  two  cousins.  He was  a 
chemist, an d  she  was  a social
 worker.  They  went
  to Theresienstadt for  six  years,  
and  he survived  because he was  in charge  
of delousing, and she  survived  because she  

took  care  of one  of her  child
ren. But  they  told 
 these  stories; it always  amazed  me 
that every  mo rning she  would  knock  on his  
window  to let  him k
now  that  she  was  
still  alive. And  they   came  to
 this country  and  had  a very
  successful life  here.  He 
came  -- he worked  for,  I forgot  what  
company in Pittsburg, a ch
emical company, and  
did  very   well.
 
Q: Was  it Dupont?
 
A: I'm  sorry.  I didn't  hear  you.
 
Q: Was  it Dupont?  Was  it Dupont?
 
A: No.  No.  It was  so mething, somebody el
se  in Pittsburg, I don
't  remember the  
company.
 
Q: Okay.  Let's  go back  th
en  to when  your  parent
s become increasingly concerned 
about  that  the  Nazis  have 
 come. Your  father  thinks  it's  passing. Your  mother  
thinks, no, th ey're going  to be here  for  a 
while. How  did  things evolve?  Ho w  did  
they  develop at the  school 
 and  in your parents' plans?
 
A: Well,  by that  time,  by 1935,  Jews  we
re  not  allowed to direct  schools anymore, 
and  my  mo ther  planned that 
 we would go to Switzerland, an
d  there  were  a lot  of 
Jewish refugees in Switzerland. And  my  pa
rents started a school. It was  in a place  
called  Gland,  wh ich  was  about  ha
lfway between Geneva  and  ?L ausanne?.
 
Q: G-L-O-N?
 
A: G-L-A:-N-D.
 
Q: Gland. Okay .
 
A: Gland. And  in the  beginn
ing the  school  was  made  
up mostly  of German  refugee 
kids  who  had  escaped  to Sw itzerland, and  th
e  school  was  quite  successful, but  we 
stayed  there  on the  -- three  years,  and  th
en  in 1936  we came  to the  United  States.
 
Q: I'm  a little  bit  confused by the  dates.
 
A: 1938.  I'm  sorry.
 
Q: All  right. Do you  remember anything
 about  your leaving Gunderstein?  Do you  
reme mb er any  details ab
out when  you  left  or how  you  left? 
 
A: I was  two  or three  years  old.
 
Q: No,  I meant  when  yo
u  left  Germany to go --
 
A: When  I left  Germany, yes,  we were  
very  worried about getti
ng over  the  border  
into  Switzerland.  I remember th at.
 

Q: Did  you  go by car?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Did  you  go by car?
 
A: We went  by three  different cars.  Had  
very  little tro uble at the  border.  We claimed 
that  we weren 't Jewish because they  were 
 letting -- I can  remember that  I was very  
embarrassed because somebody asked  me to take
  down  my pants  to prove  that  I 
wasn't  Jew ish, and  I was  only  about 10 
or 12,  so it was  very  embarrassin g , but  
probably  wo rth it.
 
Q: {Laughter}
 
A: And  we started a school  in Switzerland.
 
Q: What  I'm  interested in is the  detail  of
 leaving Germany. Wh y  would  it have  been   
three  cars?
 
A: We took  some  other  Jewish  students wi
th  us,  and  we thought that  the  Swiss  
would  be more  likely  to let  
us in if there  were  small  
groups  rather  than  one  --
 
Q: Larger  group?
 
A: -- larger  group.
 
Q: So it wasn™t three cars in a row?
 
A: No, it wasn™t three cars in a row. We went 
at differen t times  across  the  border. The  
Swiss  were  very anxious in those  days  abou
t  letting too  many  Jews  into  the country.
 
Q: Were  you  and  your  pare
nts and  sisters in one  car  or
 were  you  split  across  the  
three?
 
A: I was  in a car  with  my fa
ther  and  one  sister, and  my 
mother  was  in a car  with  
another sister.
 
Q: And  were  you  co ncerned?  Do  you 
 rememb er if you  were concerned about  
whether they'll make  it?
 
A: Oh,  abso lutely.  But  that
  was  a time  of great  c
oncern anyway, all  the  w ay  
around.
 
Q: Did  your  parents have  assets?
 
A: Assets?
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 

A: They  had  inherited a fair  amount  of 
money  from  my  grandfather, but  wh en  you  
left  Germany in  those  days  you were  
allowed to take  a t
housand dollars and  -- a 
thousand marks,  I guess  it was  -- and  everything else  was confiscated.
 
Q: So th ey  had  inherited money,
  but  did  they  have  a ho
use of their  own? Did  they  
have  a building?
 
A: All  that  was  lost.  We had  some  
friends in Switzerland who  helped  in the  
beginning until  the  scho
ol  got  started, but  we ha
d  almost  no money  at all.
 
Q: Okay.  And  while  you  were  in Switz
erland was  there discussion of wh at  was  
going  on in Germany?
 
A: Oh,  yes,  of course, particularly since  
most  of the students were  from  Germany and  
had  relatives in Germany and  relatives in 
concentration camps,  an d  it was  always 
discussion of wh at  was  going  on in Germany.
 
Q: Had  those  students come  from  your  sc
hool, your parents' schools, the  ones  --
 
A: Some  of them  did.  Some  of them  we
re  children of people  who  had  come  to 
Switzerland and  --
 
Q: And  one  question that  kind  of goes
  back  a little  bit: 
Your  mother, as a 
psychoanalyst, did  she  have  her  own practice?
 
A: She  never  practiced.
 
Q: She  never  practiced?
 
A: She  practiced her  trade  in the  school  
by seeing  every child  -- hey,  stop  growling 
-- she  -- sh e  -- the  schools really  were  pa
rtly  successful because she  was  there  and 
working with  every  child  --
 
Q: Individually?
 
A: -- in the  school.
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  1938,  why  
would  your  parents decide  to leave Switzerland? It was  a 
safe  country.
 
A: There was  several reasons.  One  is that  
the  Swiss  were very  dubious about  having  
Germans, and  they  were  sending people  
back  to Germany at the  time.  Secondly, 
our  visa had  run  out,  and  we were  actual
ly very   lucky.  In those days  if you  were  
Jewish  you  had  a "J"  in your  German 
passport, and  American 
immigration laws  in 
those  days meant  that  if you  were  Jewish  
it took  three  or four  mo re years  before  
you  could  get,  while  they  were  perfec
tly happy  to take  non-Jewish Germans, and  

we had  a friend  at the  German  Consulate in
 Geneva  who  made  sure  that  we had 
passports without a "J"  in it,  which  gave 
 us an early immigration visa  to America.
 
Q: I see.  I see.  So for  a
ll  those  reasons -- so that when
  you  left,  do you  rememb er 
leaving Switzerland?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: How  did  you  leave?
 
A: We went  by car  to France  and  took  a 
ship  -- I believe it was  
?La  Sauve?  to the  
United  States.
 
Q: Did  you  speak  French  at the  time?
 
A: I spoke  pretty  good  Fren
ch   then  because I'd  lived 
 in the  French  part  of 
Switzerland for  two  years.
 
Q: And  who  was  on this  trip?  Was  it just
  your  parents and  
sisters at this  point?
 
A: There  were  two  other  former  students who  came  with  us.
 
Q: And  your  sister's fiancé?
 
A: And  my  -- he had  already -- he was  non-Jewi
sh, and  he was  able  to get  a visa  for  
America, so he was  already in Am
erica by the  time  we got  here.
 
Q: Going  back  to when  you  
were  still  in Germ
any and  then  also  in Sw itzerland, your  
school  had  non-Jewish kids  in it?
 
A: Oh,  yes.
 
Q: But  was  your  social  life  confined  to the 
 people  in the school?  Did  you  have  any  
other  contact with  Germans, non-Jew
ish Germans outside of the  school?
 
A: Yeah.  Of course, I was  very  young,  but,  
as I said,  I played  soccer  a lot,  and  we 
played  other  teams  from  other parts  of Ge
rmany, and  people  came  in from  the  area. 
There was  no prejudice against Jews  at the  ti
me. If there  was, it w as  not  apparent, and  
so we had  a lot  of Germans who would  --
 
Q: By th e  time  you  leave  Europe  you're  in France  --
 
A: Switzerland.
 
Q: Switzerland. And  then  you 
 go to France. And  then  --
 
A: Well,  we just  drove  through and  sailed  from  France.
 
Q: Did  you  feel  German  anymore?
 

A: I didn't. I think  was  too  young  to really
  feel German. My sister, my oldest  sister  
felt  very  much  that she  had  lost  her  home 
 when  she  left. I didn't  really. I never  felt  
particularly German, and  havi
ng  learned French in Switzerla
nd, and  so I actually all  
my life  I h aven't felt  particularly German?
 
Q: Your  language, you  know,  how 
 you  spoke  with
  your parents.
 
A: German.
 
Q: German. Until  the  end?
 
A: Until  my sister's children 
would  scream, "English, please,
" when  we were  talking 
German, so that  we eventually started talk
ing German. My parents always  had a very  
strong  accent  because they'd   le
ft  when  they   were already adults, and  I guess  I had  a 
min imal a c cen t  so .
 
Q: Well,  I mean,  the  value  of having  anothe
r language in the  house  is the  kids  never  
understand what  you'r e  saying. 
And  sometimes that's  importa
nt. Where  did  you  come  
to the United  States? Where  did  you  arri
ve, and  where  did  
you settle  and  why?
 
A: We arrived at New  York.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: And  at first  all  six  of 
us lived  in one  hotel  room.
 
Q: Do  yo u   reme mb er t h e  n ame?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Do you  remember where?
 
A: I just  remember th at  there  were  six  
of us in the  hotel room
. {coughs) -- excuse me.
 
Q: That's  okay.  Do you  want  some  water?
 
A: No.  I'm  all  right.  I'll  get  so me  in a 
minute. And  I was  -- I was  sent  to an awful  
school  and didn't  like  it at all.
 
Q: Was  this  in Manhattan?
 
A: I was  in -- it was  a -- I can't  rememb er 
what  kind  of school  it was. I was  only  
there  for  about  six  months.
 
Q: Was  this  in Manhattan?
 
A: It was  in Manhattan.
 
Q: It was  Manhattan.
 

A: But  my parents very  soon  st
arted a school  in Windsor, Vermont.
 
Q: Aah,
 
A: The  school  was  called  the  Windsor M
ountain School. It was  called  the  Windsor 
Mountain School  all  the  way  through until  it cl
osed  in 1987  or '8 6,  or something like  
that.
 
Q: And  how  did  they  come  to choose  
Vermont as the  place to have  the  school?
 
A: They  had  various friends, and  one  of 
them  was  a writer na
med  Doro thy Canfield 
Fisher, who  was  quite  a famous writer at 
th e  time,  an d  she  lived  in Arlington, 
Vermont, and  said  there  was  th is  place  th at
  would  be very  good  for the  school. So 

we moved  to -- the  school  
then  eventually
 moved  to Manchester, Vermont, and  then   
to Lenox, Massachusetts.
 
Q: To Lenox,  Massachusetts?  That's  quite  a 
change. I mean,  it's  
quite  a change  from  
city  life  in  New  York  to,  I assu me, town  life  in Vermont.
 
A: We,  I guess,  were  never  really  invested
 in New  York, and  plans  were  always  to 
move  out  back  into
  the  country, so --
 
Q: So it didn't feel  like  much  of a change?
 
A: It didn't feel  like  
much  of a change, huh-uh.
 
Q: What  do you  remember, and  what  can  
you  tell  and describe about  those  years  
right  after  you  came,  from 
 1938 through, through -- we'll  
come  to  the  time  when  
you  beco me a Ritchie Boy.  Bu t,  you  know, 
 you're  a teenager now,  and you  have  
American society.
 
A: Well, I went  to a local  high  school  beca
use our  school wasn't   working yet.  Then  I 
went  to the  Windsor Mountain School  for  my  
last  two  years  of high  school.  I had  a 
scholarship at a place  called  Wagner  College in
 Staten Island, but  after  three  months, 

because I was  a German National, they  as
ked  me to leave,  and  through various 
friends, and  because I was  a great  soccer 
 player, I got accepted 
at Swarthmore, and  I 
stayed  in Swarthmore fo
r four  years  and  graduated from  Swarthmo re.
 
Q: I think much  better 
 than  Wagner  College.
 
A: Much better  than  Wagner  
College, yes.  And  then  I was 
the,  I think,  the  first  -- 
this  was  after  the  war  of course, and  they
  had  to take  the veterans. I got  a master's 
degree  at ?Bridmall?, which  I think  I was  th
e first  man  to get  a degree  in Bridmall.
 
Q: What  was  your  degree  in?
 
A: Modern  European  History.
 

Q: As a kid,  well,  sort  of a young  te
enager adolescent coming 
 to American, do you  
remember your  first  impressions of what  this
  place  w as  like,  w h at  the  people  were  
like, what society was  like?
 
A: Very  hard  to remember. I think  I was  
most  worried about  learning the  language 
and  learning to fit  in. It wasn 't  that 
 difficult because when  
the  Windsor Mountain 
School  started, there  were  only  about  eight 
 students. It later  beca
me  much  larger, so 
that  we all  had  sort  of a ready-made --
 
Q: But  before  then  you  
were  in this  school  which 
 wasn 't successful for  you.
 
A: I was  only  there  for  about  six  mont
hs. It was  a Lutheran school, and  it was  
terrible.
 
Q: Why?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Why?
 
A: I can 't  really  remember why  I hated  it, 
 but  I think  it was  regimented it,  and  --
 
Q: Was  it strict?
 
A: It was  strict, and  I didn't   think  we we
re  learning anything in  th
e  classes. And,  of 
course, by the  time  I was  15 or 16,  I'd  be
en  through a fair  amount  of ch anges in my  
life,  so that  I was  probably mo re  conscious 
of the world  around  me than  the  people  
my age  there,  and  th
at kind  of bothered me.
 
Q: Could  be very  lonely.
 
A: I was  lonely, because I didn't  speak  English very well.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: This  was  three  mo nths  af
ter  we arrived in this country.
 
Q: You  mentioned that  your 
 parents had  the  friend  in  Vermont who  was  a well  
known  writer. Did  they  have  a circle  of 
people  already in  the  Un ited  States  that  
were part  of a social  circle?
 
A: They  had,  for  instance?Tomus  Mun?  
was  a frien d  of theirs, and  various other  
writers. One  of the  first students was  the  
daughter of Karl  ?Sutme yer? who  was  a 
German  writer, and  there  was  a whole  gr
oup  of German  and American intellectuals 
who  supported the  school  an
d  they helped   us get  going.
 

Q: Well,  it's  unusual in many  ways  becaus
e mo st  people who  came  in the  United  
States  didn't  have  such  a circle, and  it su
ggests that  -- I don't  me
an  the  term  in any 
negative way  -- but  an elite  kind  of social
  circle  that had  come  from  Europe.
 
A: It certainly was  easier  fo
r  us than  for  many  other German  refugees. I don't  -- you  
were  probably not  alive in those  days,  but  
there  was  a very  strong  an tisemetic strain  
in America at that  time.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: And  coming  from  Germany, that  was  particularly --
 
Q: You  felt  it?
 
A: Oh,  yeah.  It was  -- it wasn 't   clear  at
 Swarthmore, which  is a Quaker  school, and  
therefore obviously  not  -- but  there  was  an
tisemitism in the  area  
where  we lived  and 
you  could  sort  of sense  it.  Maybe  we 
were  overly sensitive about  it.  I don't  know.
 
Q:  Well,  the  question I would  have  woul
d  be,  did  you remember instances where  
you  could  see  it?   You  know, thin
gs  like  that  are  very  hard  --
 
A: Just  remarks, but  nothing physical or pe
ople  would talk  about  kikes  or something 
like  that.
 
Q: They  would  say  such  things?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: They  would  say  such  things, using  those  words?
 
A: That's  how  I learned that  word.  It 
was  somebody -- and  I can  reme mb er asking  
somebody what  does  it mean,  
and th ey  explained it to me.
 
Q: Yeah,  something that  at
 that  time  was  socially
 acceptable.  No ostracism.
 
A: And  it really  is a b ig  change  in this 
 country from  the antisem
itism that  existed at 
that  time  to the  pre
tty  much total  accept
ance that  exists  now.
 
Q: Do you  remember when   y
ou  felt  that  change  happen   or was  it really  gradual?
 
A: No,  it was  gradual. And,  to be honest 
 with  you,  I never  felt particularly Jewish. 
The  only  reason  that  I would  tell  people  that
  I was  Jewish  is that  I felt  to explain 
what  the  Germans did  and  that  I wasn 't 
 ashamed of being  Jewish. Bu t  mo st  of my  
life  nobody  asked,  and  I was always  blond 
 and  not  particularly
 looking of any  kind 
of -- so that  it never  -- in many  years  it 
was  never mentioned. I me an, and  th e  fact  
that  we were  not religious, of course, made  a big  difference.
 

Q: Well,  you  an ticipated one  of my  questio
ns, which  was did  wh at  you  experience, 
you  know,  being  Jewish  whether, whatever 
relationship you  would  have  to it,  the  
outside world  in Germany certainly, 
you  know,  shaped  your  destiny.
 
A: Abso lutely, yeah.
 
Q: And  I wondered whether or not  you  felt 
 more  interested in Judaism as a result, 
where  you  may  not  have  been .
 
A: Not  really.
 
Q: Not  really?
 
A: My parents were,  I guess  what  was  calle
d  then  free thinkers and  had  absolutely 
no religio us -- I mean,  I don't think  I ever  heard 
 them  talk  about  God  or any  kind of 
religion. And  it wasn't  until  the  Nazis  that
  the  Jews became  a race,  you  know. And  
so that  when  I grew  up it was  a religion. A
nd  since  we weren't religious, then  it didn't  
play  any  part  in my life  really.
 
Q: Are  there  other  things  that  you  thin
k  are  important for  so
meone to know  about  
your  early  years  here  in the  US as a 
young  teenager going  to the  school, meeting 
American kids,  being  exposed 
to this  different environment?
 
A: When   you're  young  enough  you  adopt  
very  quickly. I guess  I was  13 or 14 when   
I came  here,  and  really  adopted very  fast  to
 -- and  of course  we all  wanted  to adopt  
to the  American. I remember that  we made
  a point  of speaki
ng English and  not  
somehow standing out  as immigrants.
 
Q: What  kind  of contact did  your  parents ha
ve  with  the relatives 
who  stayed  behind  
in Germany?
 
A: We had  very  few  relatives th at  left 
 behind  in Germany. As I said,  my mother's 

mother  died  at Theresienstadt. There  were  
-- my  mo ther's brother a
nd  his  wife  fled  
the Nazis  in Austria, and  then
  in Czechoslovakia, and  they went  to Ro mania, and  then   
decided they  weren't g o ing  to run  anymor
e and  killed  themselves. They  had  two
 
adolescent children, tw o  boys,  
who  somehow made  their  way. One  of them  came  to  
this  country  as a -- he was  kind  of a la
nguage genius  and  be
came  a professor at 
?Broome? The other  one  had  
a very  -- he went  from  -- he went  to England during  
the  war,  joined  the  Czech  Air  Force,  got  
shot  down over  Italy, 
 spent  two  years  in 
a camp,  went  back  to Czechoslovakia 
after  the  war,  got  caught  by the
 
Communists.
 
Q: Oh,  my God.
 

A: Who  were  suspicious of him  because he ha
d  served  in the Czech  Air  Force. With  
the  help  of Eleanor Roosevelt, Sinclair
 Lewis,  Dorothy Thom
pson, various other  
people, we got  him  out  of Czechoslovakia, and 
 he taught  at my school for  the  next  
15 years.
 
Q: Amazing. And  what  was  his  name? 
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: What  was  his  name?
 
A: ?Getivena?.
 
Q: ?Getivena??
 
A: Yeah.  I think  he wrote  a book  or some
body wrote  a book  ab out  his  very  difficult 
life.
 
Q: It certainly sounds  that  way.
  When  he was  shot  down in
 Italy,  he was  in an Italian 
prisoner of war  camp?
 
A: He was  in an Italian prison  of war  camp.
 
Q: Which  is probably why  he surv ived  it.
 
A: That  probably was  a lot  better  th
an  a German  prisoner of war  camp.
 
Q: What  did  you  study  at Swarth
mo re? What  would  you graduate in?
 
A: European History.
 
Q: Okay.  So your  bachelor's --
 
A: Modern  History.
 
Q: So your  bachelor's
 and  your  master's were  in gold subjects?
 
A: Yeah.  I wrote  a -- my master  thes
is  was  about  the Yalta  Conference.
 
Q: Oh,  really.  How  interesting.  How  inte
resting for lots  of reasons. Why  did  you  
choose  that?  Why  did  you ch
oose  modern  European  history? 
 
A: Well,  I guess  I was  very  interested in 
what  was  going on in the  world. I had  
spent,  oh,  four  years  in th
e  Army, and  that  made  it ev
en  more  important for  me to 
know  what was  going  on.  At one  point  I had  wanted   to teach  modern  history, but  --
 
Q: Okay.  Now,  I'm  a little  b
it  confused by chronological. Yo
u  arrive  in 1938.  Let's  
say, between '38  and  '39,  
you  get  settled from  New  York   to Windsor, Vermont.  At 
that  point  it's  1939,  Worl
d  War  II happens, Poland  is invaded.  Your  parents set  up 

the  school  in Vermont. For  two  years  to 
go to a local  school, an
d  then you  finish  
your  high  school  in,  at
 your  own  parents' school.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: That  would  be what  year?
 
A: Probably  '42  or '43  somewhere around  th ere.
 
Q: Okay.  So your  co
llege life  is post-war?
 
A: Well,  I had  one  year  in co
llege before  I jo
ined  the Army.
 
Q: And  that  was  at the  Wagner  College?
 
A: First,  I was  half  a year  at Wagner  
Co llege and  the other  half  at Swarthmo re.
 
Q: I see.  T h at's  was  the  bridge  I wanted  to 
come  to.  So you  have  that  half  year  at 
Wagner. You  transfer to Swarthmo re. Why  don'
t  you  finish  the  college, the  full four  
years  at Swarthmore?
 
A: I did.
 
Q: You  did?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: At once?  No,  you  interrupted it.
 
A: I interrupted it.  I had  three  and  a half  y
ears,  four years  in the  Army,  and  then  I 
went  back  to Swarthmore.
 
Q: Okay .  Why  did  you  interr
upt it?  Was  it your  choice?
 
A:  I was  18,  and  I loved  skiing, and  so
mebody told  me if you 
 join  the  mo untain 
troops  you'll  do a lot  of skiing. So  I volunt
eered for  the  mountain troops, which  were  
in a terrible place  called  Camphill, Colorado,and  I spent about eight  months  there  
until  I was  transferred. I suddenly got  orders  to transfer to Camp  Ritchie.
 
Q: Tell  me,  tell  me a little  
bit  about  those  eight  mont
hs in Colorado. Why  was  it 
terrible?
 
A: It was  cold.  The  Army  ha
d  just  started to train mountain
 troops  and  didn't  really  
know  what  they  were doing. 
The  camp  itself  had  probab
ly 100  wood  stoves, which  
gave  everybody which  stayed
  -- the  smoke  stayed  in
 
the  camp,  and  we all  got  rheumatis
m and  various bump s  and bruises and  --
 
Q: So it was  cold  and  not  we
ll  heated, not  efficiently heated?
 

A: Each  barrack had  a stove  at the  end  that 
 spewed  out, was  a wood  stove,  and  was  
not  very  warm  in the  barracks, and  we ne
ver  did  any  skiing. We hiked  a lot  with 
backpacks, and  I was  very  
glad  to get  out  of there.
 
Q: What  I remember from  my 
reading of the  US military fo
rces  in World  War  II is 
that  before  it had  been  much more  
of a professional army ,  and  World  War  II 
brought in civilians, and  in many  ways  
was  a great  leveler, or people from  totally 
different backgrounds were
  thrown  together.
 
A: That's  correct.
 
Q: Did  you  experience that?
 
A: Oh,  yeah.  When  I first  
went  to the  mounta
in troops, for instan
ce, most  of the  
people  were  college guys  who, people  w
ho  had  started college, wood  skiers, and 
volunteers, and  then   they  didn't  get  en
ough  people. And th ey  started send  draftees, 
for  instance, from  Georgia and various other 
 southern states  w
ho  were  absolutely 
totally miserable.  I can  reme
mber that  this  one  guy,  he was  a sharp shooter and  
was  very  proud  of it,  but  it was  so cold 
that  you  had  to wear  gloves, and  he refused 
to wear gloves, and  his  hands  kept  freezing 
to the  trigger, and  we tried  to explain it to 
him.  But  eventually he went 
 to the hospital because he had, 
 was  just  one  of those  -- 
 
Q: It's  a detail, but  it ends  up being  ve
ry  crucial for somebody
 who  was  a sharp  
shooter.
 
A: That's  right.  And  he couldn't do it wit
hout gloves, and  he didn't  feel  he could.
 
Q: Were  you  the  only  one  who  came  
from  German y who  was 
 in that  mountain 
camp?
 
A: I don't  know.
 
Q: Did  you  guys  talk  mu ch  about  with  
 one  another? Did you  get  to know  one  
another very   well?
 
A: Oh,  we got  to know  each  other,  but  at
 that  time  I spoke perfe
ct English.  And  in 
those  days  the  Army  didn't want  any  noncitizens.
 
Q: Were  you  a citizen by that  time?
 
A: No,  I became  a citizen of
 Leadville, Colorado, which was 
 right  near  the  camp.  
And  I was  -- I guess  I was  18 
or 19 when  I became  a citizen.
 
Q: Did  it mean  something?
 
A: Huh?
 

Q: Did  it mean  somethi
ng wh en  that  happened ?
 
A: I'd  been  living  in the  United  States  
for  a while,  and being  in the  Army,  it was  
nice  to be a citizen, but  it wasn 't   a terribly big  thing.
 
Q: And  now  you  say  Camp  Ritchie happened.  
It sounds  like that  transfer sort  of fell  
from  the  sky.
 
A: Yes,  it did.
 
Q: So so meone in th e  Army   mu st  have  known  your background.
 
A: Somebody found  out  I'm  sure,  and  there  
were  -- when  I talked 
 to the  people  at 
Ritchie, there  were  a lot  of people  like  
that.   So I was  younger
 than  most  because 
many of the  German  emigrees were  older  when
  they  came  to this country . They   also  
were  suddenly called  out. So mebody in their 
 service records found  that  they  spoke  
German  or French, and  so we
 got  transferred to Ritchie.
 
Q: So now  where  in R
itchie.  Tell  us what  Ritchie was, where  it was.
 
A: Ritchie --
 
Q: As mu ch  detail  as you  can.
 
A: Ritchie was  a very  strange camp.  It wa
s  near Baltimore. Actually, it was  in the  
Catoctin Mountains, and  almo
st  everybody had  a different mo ther  tongue  than 
English. Many  of the  people  were  older  
than  I was. And it was  -- we learned how  to 
interrogate prisoners of war.
 
Q: Well,  if you  could  walk  me through a 
few,  some  of the details. Do you  remember 
what  it was  like  when  you 
 got there? Who  you  first  ta
lked  to,  some  of the  
officials, h o w they  put  in one 
 place  rather  than  another place?
 
A: All  right.  I don't  really  reme mb er mu ch  of that.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: It's  50 years  ago.
 
Q: I know.
 
A: Ritchie was  more  co
mfortable than  the  --
 
Q: Colorado?
 
A: Colo rado.  And  it was  strange because peopl
e  either spoke  French  or German  or 
Japanese, and  there  was relatively rigorous tr
aining in  how  to in terrogate people, what  
not  to do,  for  instance.  In
 the  three  years  that  I in
terrogated people, 
I never  touched 

a German  prisoner, even when  I interrogate
d a concentration camp   guard   that you  
wanted  to rip  apart  with  your  hands,  we 
never  touched them,  and  I don't   think  any  
of the  other  interrogators ever  touched German  prisoners.
 
Q: So that  was  something that  you  learne
d very  early  on? That  was  one  of the  
rules?
 
A:  Abso lute rules.  Don't  touch.   You  ca
n  play  whatever intellectual trick  you  want  
to play  on them  to make  them ta
lk,  but  you  can't  touch  them.
 
Q: Can  you  rememb er anythi
ng else  about  that  trai
ning, how  to become  an 
interrogator, a prisoner of war interrogato r?
 
A: There  are  two  things:  You  had  to lear
n  the  makeup  of the  German  army,  what  
divisions, who  was  commander, what division, and 
 so on. And  they  were  very  strict  
about  not torturing anybody ev er.  I can  show  you  a picture of --
 
Q: Sure.  I'd  love  to see  it.
 
A: -- to prove  that  I was  young  once.
 
Q: {Laughter}
 
A: That's  me.
 
Q: Where?  Which  one?
 
A: (Indicating)
 
Q: Oh,  my.
 
A: These  are  German  prisoners.
 
Q: So this  is when  you'r
e  already over  in Europe?
 
A: Oh,  yes.  Yes.
 
Q: Now,  when  you  -- okay,  so
 the  training lasted  how long?
 
A: Eight  weeks.
 
Q: And  what  kind  of -- do you  remember w h at  kind  of a feeling you  got  there?  

Were  you  -- were  you  enthusiastic about  this
  assignment?  Did  you  feel  it had  some 
particular meaning?
 
A: I thought that  I was  going  to be able 
 to do mo re  -- I felt  very strongly, having  
come  from  Germany, that  it was all  -- our  
views  were  passivists, that  I co uldn't  let 
other people  do it for  me because it didn't, didn't 
 seem right  at the  tim
e.  So,  as I said,  
I volunteered.  Once  we were  
finished with  Ritchey, we
 were  assigned to various 

divisions as a team. I was  in the  79th  Divi
sion and stayed with   the  79th  Division all  
the  way  through Europe. You  can  s
ee  where  we went  somewhere here.
 
Q: Okay.  So can  you  tell 
 me a little  bit  ab out  --
 
A: See.
 
Q: Okay .  You  were  -- it looks  here  on th is
  map  that  you come  from  the  English 
Channel through France.
 
A: We came  through the  English 
Channel. We landed  in Normandy.
 
Q: On D-Day?
 
A: D plus  18 hours.  So it was  close.
 
Q: So was  it not  even  a full  
day  after  the  first  landing?
 
A: No,  that's  right.
 
Q: Can  you  tell  me  what 
 you  saw  when  you  --
 
A: A lot  of dead  people.  And  I'd   never  
seen  dead  people befo re
  in my life,  so --
 
Q: I can 't  imagine what  the  feeling -- I wo
uld  have  been scared  out  of my  wits.
 
A:  I was.   I was.  Two  things. Two  things 
 that  I remember very  well  is cro ssing the  
channel. I was extremely seasick. It was  sma
ll  boats,  a small flat-bottom boat,  and  I 
can  remember that  somebody said there's an  Ge
rman  plane  that's   
going  to attack  us. I 
said,  "Okay. I hope  it hits  us." I was  so seasick, so --
 
{Laughter by both}
 
Q: Did  you  know  that  you  were  
part  of this  invasion of Europe?
 
A: Yes.  Yes.
 
Q: When   did  they  tell  you?
 
A: We -- because I was  an interrogator by that
  time,  we were info
rmed probably three  
weeks  befo re  the  landing wh at day  the  landing would  be and  wh ere  we would  be 
landing.  Of course, we weren 't allowed to stick  
our  nose out  of the  camp  after  that  --
 
Q: Of course.
 
A: -- and  it was  heavily surrounded.  It was  
in,  I think it was  in South  Hamp ton. And  
so we knew.  And  actually the  landing was  
supposed to be a day  earlier than  the  6th 
of June,  and  --
 
Q: Hang  on just  a second.
 

{interview interrupted}
 
Q: This  is a continuation of the  USHMM  in
terview with Mr.  Eric  Heinz  Bondy. And  
we were  talking about,  about  the  landing at
 Normandy and  wh en   you  learnt  of it and  
how  the  camp  was closed  afterwards, presumab
ly to prevent news  of
 this leaking out,  
and  I interrupted  you  in the  middle  of you telling me.
 
A: What  was  I saying?  Do you  know?
 
Q: I think  it was  some thing about  the  boat  going  over.
 
A: Oh,  yeah.  I was  very  se
a  sick  on the  boat,  and  the landing itself  was  k ind  of 
traumatic b ecause I had  never seen  a lot  of de
ad  people, and  there  were  a lot  of dead 
Americans, either  in the  wate
r  or on the  beach,  and  that 
was  the  beginning of about  
a year  and  a half  of warfare.
 
Q: What  happened to  you?  Wh at  were  your  experiences?
 
A: What  were  the  experiences?
 
Q: Yeah,  after  you  landed.  Wh at  happened next?
 
A: Oh,  we were  very  busy.  The  idea  was 
 that  German prisoners would  talk  best  if 
you  talked  to them  with
in  ten minutes of their  capture 'c ause  they  were  
psychologically still 
 traumatized. So we were  very  cl
ose  to the  front lines always, and  
we started right  away   interrogating prisoners.
 
Q: So you  didn't   face  comb at
?  Even   though  you  were  cl
ose to the  front  lines,  you  
weren't involved in comb at?
 
A: Not  actually.  We always  carried guns
  and  occasionally somebody was  shooting 
at us,  and  we would  shoot  back,  
but we were  not  combat  soldiers.
 
Q: Do you  remember 
the  very  first  person  you interrogated?
 
A: No.  I ended  up interrogating probably, oh, 
 two  or three  thousa
nd people  over  the  
next  two  years.
 
Q: Oh,  my goodness.
 
A: So I don't  remember them  
too  well. I can  remember that
  if somebody didn't  want  
to tell  me what  I wanted  to 
know,  I would  say,  well,  se
e  that  solider at the  door. 
He's  from  Poland. He just  lost  his  parent
s in Po land. Would  you  
rather  talk  to him  
or to me? And  they   usually 
would  rather  talk  to me.
 
Q: Do you  have  a memo ra
ble interrogation, you  know, 
somebody who,  you  know,  
from  those  2,000  that  
you  would have  interrogated?
 

A: I have  to admit  that  I had  pretty  
strong  feelings about  the  Germans, and  
particularly ranking officers. I remember probab
ly -- there  was  nobody  who  was  really 
exciting. There  was  one  general who  knew
  the  division commander of the  division I 
was  in.  They  had  somehow gotten  together, a
nd  he was  very  upset  by the  fact  that  
I treated him  like  everybody else. And  the  
general came down  to say  hello  to him,  
but  we didn't  treat  him  
any better  than  anybody else.
 
Q:  What  can  you  tell  us about  those  interrogations?
 
A: About  what?
 
Q: About  the  interrogations, about  -- you  
mentioned that your  own  feelings were  
pretty  strong.
 
A: Well,  where  I was,  the  information we 
were  looking for was  
usually pretty  simple, 
like,  what  division are  you from, what  orde
rs  did  you  have  to attack, where  were  
you supposed to attack, how  ma
ny  people  were  there.  I mean, th ey  were  all  very  
direct  questions connected 
to the tactical situation.
 
Q: Military questions?
 
A: Military questions.
 
Q: Do you  remember the  pl
ace  where  you  had  your  first interro gation? Was  it in 
France?
 
A: It was  in France, yeah.
 
Q: Was  it close  to Norm
andy? Was  it in Normandy?
 
A: It was  probably in Normandy, yeah.
 
Q: Yeah,  did  you  meet  any  soldiers your  own  age?
 
A: German  soldiers?
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: Oh,  yeah.  The  Germans by 
that  time  had  lost  a lo
t  of people  on the  Russian 
front,  and  they  were  drafting 17, 16,  some
times 15 year  olds  into  the  Army.  So 
there  were  a lot  of people  younger than  I was.
  One  of the  things  that we did  as an 
interpreter -- as an interrogator, we were very 
 conscious that  the  Germans were  rank  
conscious. And I was  allowed to wear  any  
kind  of button  up to
 Major, which  on an 
18-year-old was  a little  iffy,  of course, and we finally settled in the  end  of wearing US 

buttons that just  said  US on th e  shirt. It di
d  allow  me to go eat 
 in the  officers' mess  
occasionally.
 

Q: But  you  say  it was  because the  German
s were  rank conscious that  you  were  
allowed to wear  these  buttons. 
Did  that  mean  that  -- did 
 that  mean  that  in the 
interrogation situation somebody wh
o  would  have  been  higher  ranking th an  you  sees  
this  button  and  then  is more likely  --
 
A: More  likely  to talk. The 
 US button  sort  of represented some  kind  of a special 
troops  to the  Germans so that
  -- but  there  were  Germans 
when  I first  started, and  it 
was  a corporal who  said  they  wouldn't talk
  to a corporal; get  
me a lieutenant; I will  
talk  to him.
 
Q: Did  they   know  that  you  were  Jewish?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Was  there  any  time  in the  interrogatio
n that  you  would reveal  anything about  
yourself?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Did  you,  did  you  ever  interrogate 
anybody who  was close  
to where  you  had  
come  from,  from  Gunderstein or Œ
 
A: Yeah,  not  really. I once  interrogated so
mebody who had  been 
 at the  school  in 
Germany.
 
Q: You're  kidding?
 
A: And  -- but  that  was  about  as close  as I got  to --
 
Q: And  did  they  talk  about  your  parents?
 
A: They  asked  about  my parents.
 
Q: So they  knew  who  you  were?
 
A: I explained to th em  who  I was.
 
Q: Were  your  feelings any  different to th
e  15 and  16 year old  than  to the  higher  
ranking officers?
 
A: Not  really.  They  were  all  G ermans to me.
 
Q: When  did  the  conversation or the 
 interrogation ever touch  on what  the  
concen tration camps  were  about?
 
A: Most  of these  people  didn
't   know  very  much. They  kn
ew they  existed, but  I did,  
after  the  war,  spend  a short 
 time at Dachau  interrogating gu
ards  and  people  there,  
and  it looked  just  like  those 
 pictures that  you've  seen.
 

Q: So is that  what  you  were  referring to
 earlier when  you said  you  couldn't touch  
anybody, even  if he had  been  a
 
camp  guard   and  you  would  have
  wanted  to tear  him  apart?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: So this  was  from  Dachau?
 
A: That's  right.
 
Q: Do you  reme mb er the  names  of
 the  persons THAT
  you interrogated?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Do  yo u   reme mb er t h e  n ame
  of any  of these  people?
 
A: No.
 
Q: No.  Do you  remember what
  they  were  like,  the  kind  of demeanor they   had?
 
A: Very  different, you  know.  Hundreds of 
them. Some were  arrogant Nazis;  some  
were  country boys  who  didn't know any  
political consequences; some  were  o ld-time 
Army  guys  who  would  follow 
 orders  no matter  what.  So it was  a great  deal  of 
difference. Towards the  end  of war,  as I 
said,  they  were  16,  17 year  olds.
 
Q: Did  this  change  you?
 
A: The  war?
 
Q: The  experience of havi
ng  been  an interrogato r.
 
A: I think  th at  the  war  probably changed 
me,  yes.  Maybe I grew  up a lot  quicker 
than  I wo uld  have  otherwise.
 
Q: What  do you  mean  by that?
 
A: That  maybe  I was  more  serious about  th
e  things  I was doing  than  I would  have  
been  if I'd  just  been  a 21 
or a 22 year  old  in college.
 
Q: Did  your  parents know  that  this  was  your  job?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: What  did  they  think  of it?
 
A: They  were  mostly  worried
 about  wh ether I was  going  to
 get  hurt  or not.  I think  
that  was  probably the  mo st concern who  had  
soldiers who  were  near  the  front  lines. 

And  one  of the  problems was  that  there  
were  no telephones and  you  had  to write  e-
mail  letters. I had  one,  which  was special.
 

Q: Oh,  my.
 
A: I thought I had  one,  but  maybe
  I don't.  These  were e-mails.
 
Q: These  were  -- are  these  telegrams?
 
A: No,  these  are  letters.
 
Q: V-mails?
 
A: Photographed and  then  sent 
 by e-mail, or whatever the  --
 
Q: It says  a V-mail, like  Victor.
 
A: That's  what  my 
parents would  be getting.
 
Q: I see.  A nd  it's  in Eng
lish.  And  was  it this  size?
 
A: No,  it was  --
 
Q: That  was  the  original size?
 
A: That  was  the  original size,  b u t  
it was  sent  this  size, in that  size.
 
Q: And  this  is almost  like  a quarter of an 
8 1/2  by 11 piece  of pa
per. And  this  is an 
example of that.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: I see.  T h at's  very  interesting. And  you 
 have  some original documents as well. I see  
there  are  --
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- about the school?
 
A: That™s something about the school. And th
at™s a document says  I was  wounded in 
action.
 
Q: What  happened?
 
A: I didn't  get  in the  fox  hole  quic kly en ough, and  I got hit  in the  foot.
 
Q: Oh,  my goodness.  And  you  got  a Purple  Heart?
 
A: I got  a Purple  Heart,  which  I didn't  pi
ck  up until  at the  end  of the  war. People  
would  -- you  had  to have  
a certain number  of points  to get  discharged , and  Purple 
Heart  would  get  you  five  points, so I made  su
re  that  this is -- I made  sure  that  I had  
this  letter  to get  my five points  so that  --
 
Q: So you  could 
 get  discharged?
 

A: -- I could  get  discharged. But  I spent  almo
st  a year after  the  end  of the  war  in 
military government in Germany.
 
Q: What  was  that  lik e?
 
A: Couldn't  find  anybody who  wasn't  a Nazi  to
 put  in charge  of,  the  only  people  we 
could  find  to -- you  know, we was  suppos
ed to set  up governments at various places.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And  the  only  people  we 
could  find  were  people  that
  had been  in concentration 
camps,  and  they  were  often  not really  rea
dy  to run  a city,  or something like  that,  so 
it was  difficult.
 
Q: Where  were  you  based  for  that  year  after  the  war?
 
A: Various places  in Germany. You  can  see  on this  line.
 
Q: So this  route  that  is described on this  map  of --
 
A: That's  the  map  that  I went  through --
 
Q: Can  I read  some  of the  names?
 
A: Sure.
 
Q: All  right. So this  is the  route  of the  
79th  Infantry Division, and  it looks  like  that  
it went  from  France, down to France  to
 Loutenburg (ph),  Luxembourg, Strasbourg.
 
A: Well,  this  was  the  Battle  of the  Bulge  up here.
 
Q: Uh-huh, in Belgium?
 
A: In Belgium was  the  Battle 
 of the  Bulge.  We were ca
lled  up there  because there  
were  some  American troops that
  were  surrounded at the  time.
 
Q: Oh,  yes.  And  there,  and  you  get  
into  Germany through ?Kothen?, through Essen,  
Recklinhausen --
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: -- Mannheim, Winterberg, Alsfeld, Eisenach , which  was already East  Germany after  
the  war,  and  then  through --
 
A: To the  Czech  border, yes.
 
Q: -- to the  Czech  border, Felesenburg, which  is already in Czechoslovakia?
 
A: Yeah.
 

Q: So when  you  set  up the  military g
overnment, the  79th Infa
ntry Division, you  
wanted  to  set  up -- where  were  you 
based  for  that  year? Were  you  in 
Czechoslo vakia?
 
A: We moved  around. This  was  --
 
Q: This  was  the  route?
 
A: This  was  after  the  war.
 
Q: Uh-huh, that  was  after  the  war.
 
A: And  we moved  around  from  
place  to place,  and  mo st  of the  time  we went  back   
here  and  set  up military governments in this  area.
 
Q: Okay.  So that what  were
  talking about  is Recklingh
ausen, Mannheim, Winterberg --
 
A: Right.
 
Q: That's  where  the 
 military governments were  set  u p
. That's  after  the  war.  And  
then  the  79th  went  from  those places 
 to Alsfeld, Eisenach, Meiningen, Eisfeld, 
?Sonnebauch?, ?Holf?, Ash,  and 
 then  Frankenberg.  And  it was  in this  part  of 
Germany th at  you  did  -- conducted t
hose  interrogations, is that  correct?
 
A: Well,  the  interrogation was  conducted all  
the  way along  anytime there  w as  a, the  
division took  a prisoner, we would  interrogate them.
 
Q: Okay.  So that's  through  France, through Northern Fran
ce, Belguim, down  towards 
Strasbourg, back  up to
 Battle  of the  Bulge?
 
A: Right,  and  then  into  Germany.
 
Q: And  the  Battle  of the  Bulge,  
was  that  where  you  were wounded?
 
A: No,  actually, it was  earlier.  It was  in July
 somewhere.  I had  a letter  in here.  What  
did  I do with it?
 
Q: There 's some  le
tters in here,  yes.
 
A: That  said  where  I was  wo
unded.  Maybe  not.  There  it is.
 
Q: Yeah.  I certify that  I was  
present when  Tech  
IV,  Eric H. Bondy,  was  wounded in 
action  on July  11th,  1944
,  in Normandy. In 
Normandy. So it was  very  soon  after 
landing.  That  he was  treated in an Amer
ican evacuation hospital, and  the  medical 
doctor  in charge  authorized the 
Purple  Heart  was  to be issued
  to this  solider. And  it's 
signed  by Richard H --
 
A: Pepi  (ph).
 

Q: Pepi.  So this  was  very  quickly. Do 
you  rememb er anything from  that  incident?
 
A: I remember that  I went  to 
the,  to some  kind  of Army
 hospital, and  they  sewed  it 
up and  put  a bandage on it 
and told  me to go back .
 
{Laughter}
 
Q: You  mentioned that  you  had  come 
 into  contact with concentration camp  
survivors.  Do you  remember th e  first ti
me   you  saw  any  concen tration camp   
survivors after liberation?
 
A: It was  at Dachau  after  the  war.
 
Q: How  much  after  the  war?
 
A: Oh,  probably two  weeks,  th
ree  weeks  after  the Armistice.
 
Q: Okay .  So  that  wo uld  have  been  end  of
 May.  That  would have  been  end  of May  
'45?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Do you  have  memories 
of that?  Do you  have  --
 
A: Of course, yes.
 
Q: What  can  you  tell  us about  it.
 
A: As I said,  it looked  just  like  the  photogra
phs you have  seen,  a lot  of dead  people  
around, piles  of clothing.
 
Q: How  did  you  get  into  Dach au?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: How  did  you  -- tell  us how  you  got  th
ere,  what  took  to 
you  to Dachau?  Why  
were  you  sent  there?
 
A: My division was  stationed 
near  Dachau, and  they  
needed somebody
 to help  
interrogate the  guards.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So I and  another interrogator was  sent  
over  there  to interrogate the  guards  and  
make  some  recommendatio
n what to do with  them.
 
Q: And  there  was  still  surviv ors of the  camp  in the  camp?
 
A: There  was  some  still  there,  yes.
 

Q: Did  you  speak  with  them?
 
A: Yes.  But  --
 
Q: Did  they   say  anything about  those  guards?
 
A: About  what?
 
Q: About  the  guards  you  were  going  to  interrogate?
 
A: Yeah,  I asked  them  about  the  guards, and 
 they   said some  were  good;  some  were  
bad,  so -- but  they  were  in pretty  bad 
 shape. I mean,  by the  
end  of the  war  the 
Germans were  running out  of food,  and  of c
ourse  they didn't  give  any  fo od  to the  
camps,  so that  many  of them were
  really  very  badly  starved.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So that  -- and  then  I can  remember that 
 I went  around and  told  all  the  soldiers 
that  were  in the  camp  don't  give them  too 
 much  food;  it will  kill  them.  It will  kill  
them. Don't  give  them.  They  used  to ha
nd  them  chocolate, which of course  was  
terrible for  them,  and  --
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And  I rememb er that  pretty  vividly, tr
ying  to tell them.  Most  Americans soldiers 
were  very  generous that  way and  wanted  to 
feed  them  and  give 
 them  whatever they  
had. But it was  just  very  bad  for  them
  since  they  had  been starving and  --
 
Q: How  long  did  you  stay  in Dachau?
 
A: Six  days,  I think.
 
Q: And  do you  rememb er approximately how 
 many  guard s  you interrogated. I know  
it's  a tough  question.
 
A: Oh,  I'm  not  sure.  Ma
ybe  20,  25,  30 of them.
 
Q: These  people  that  you  mentioned befo re  --
 
A:  Well,  they  were  usua
lly SS guards  at the  -- there 
 were some  -- I guess  by the  
end  of the  war  they  had  some  guard s 
from  Latvia  and  va
rious other  occupied  
countries who  swore up and  do
wn  that  they  weren 't SS,  of course, but  they  were 
Latvian SS or Bastognian SS,
  but  they  were  --
 
Q: That's  interesting?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: That's  interesting.  Was 
 their  demeanor any  different
 than  the  German  guards?
 

A: Oh,  yes.  Nix  SS Latv ian.
 
Q: And  had  any  of the  prisoners identified them  --
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: -- as being  particularly crue
l  or particularly good or --
 
A: Not  particularly good.  Nobody  was  ever 
 particularly good.  Th
ey  did  point  out  
some  who  were  particularly cruel,  but
  a lot  of them  were  just  guards.
 
Q: Oh,  I had  another question, and  I just  lo
st  it. When  you  -- going  back  to the  
process of interrogation. After  you  comp lete
d an interrogation, what
 did  you  do? Did  
you  have  to write  it up and  pass  it in?
 
A: We wrote  it up and  passed  it to the,  
either  the regimental or division commander, 
depending on who  we were working fo r  at the  time.
 
Q: And  the  questions I would  assume  mu st
  have  changed by the  time  you  got  to 
those  camps?
 
A: Oh,  during  the  war  the 
 questions were  all  tactical
. After  the  war,  we were  
looking for  war  crimes  and,  of course, we 
had  arrested, oh,  a lot  of sort  of Nazis  
with  a rank  around  Mayia  (ph). And  th
en   General Patton  decided that  the  Nazis  
were  just  like  Republicans and  Democr
ats, and  we should  let  them  all  go.
 
Q: Oh,  my goodness.  Oh,  my goo
dness.  And  did  th at happen?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: That  must  have  been  galling.
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: That  must  have  been  galling.
 
A: Yes,  it was.  And  I will  admit  that  mo
st  of the  people I was  with  cheered when  
they  heard  that  Patton  was  killed.
 
Q: What  else  could  you  tell  us about  th
at  experience of having  interrogated so many  
people?
 
A: You  know,  it's  like  any  
other  job,  after  a while  --
 
Q: It becomes routine.
 
A: -- it becomes routine.  And  
paid  special attention to people  who  might  have  been   
war  crimin als, but  the  general run-of-the-m
ill solider, it got  to 
be routine, and  you 
pretty  mu ch  asked  the  same  thing  over  and  over  again.
 

Q: Did  you  catch  any  pe
ople  who  were,  you  know, 
high-ranking who  were  war  
criminals?
 
A: Occasionally, there  were  some  high  rank ing SS people who  were 
 trying  to hide,  
but  usually when  that  happ
ened we would  turn  them  over  to higher  authorities.
 
Q: The  Ritchie Boys,  how  many  -- when  y
ou  were  with  the 79th  Division, were  
they  scattered all  over  amongst various divisions?
 
A: The  Ritchie Boys  were  divided into  team s  -- one lieutenant, one  sergeant, and  one  
corporal.
 
Q: And  you  were  part  of such  a team?
 
A: And  I was  the  corporal on one  of the 
 teams.  And  each di
vision would  be getting 
one  of these  teams.
 
Q: What  was  your  -- what  was  your  inte
raction with  one another? Were  you  all  -- 
did  you  have  --
 
A: We were  always  together for  a whole  year, 
 so two years.  Slept  in the  same  place,  
and  probably got  on each others  nerves, so --
 
Q: Were  they  also,  your  team  memb ers we
re  they  also  from Germany? Did  they  

have  a similar background?
 
A: The  lieutenant was  from  
Milwaukee.  At the  time  th
e Army   did  not  want  
German  refugees or recent  refugees from Germ
any being  officers in the  Army,  so that  
the lieutenants in the  office  were  usually
 German  speaking or
 poorly  German  
speaking from  places  like  Milwa
ukee and  the other  German  --
 
Q: Midwest?
 
A: -- or New  York,  86th  
Street, wherever that  is.
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: But  the  enlisted men  were  usually the  ref
ugees. But they  were  all  -- man y   of the  
refugees would  come  from Germ
any were  older  than  I was.  They  were  36,  35.  I 
reme mb er that  the  person  I was  with,  the 
 other  sergeant was  about  35 at the  time.
 
Q: Oh,  yeah,  I forgot  for  a minute  as 
you  were  talking and  as we were  going  
through the  military process, you were  basically a kid?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: You™re basically a kid still.
 

A: Yes. I wasŠI got in the Army when I was 18,  and I guess  I got  out  when  I was  22.
 
Q: When   you  leave  Germany -- by the  one  
way,  one  last question on this. Do you  
reme mb er the  name  of your teammates, you 
 know,  the  corporal and  the  lieutenant?
 
A: I knew  it about  a month  ago  and  then  
 I've  forgotten. I was  at a Ritchie Boy  
reunion, and  I guess  both  of those guys  we
re  dead  because no
body  knew  anything 
about  them, but  I can 't   remember it now.
 
Q: Were  you  part  of the  film  that  
was  made  about  Ritchie Boys  a while  ago?
 
A: No.
 
Q: No?
 
A: No?  Were  you  contacted about  it?
 
A: No,  I saw  the  movie.
 
Q: You  saw  the  movie?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Oh,  my goodness, and  nobody  had  known  to contact you?
 
A: Yes,  I actually saw  the  movie  at a Ritchie reunion.
 
Q: Let  me go th en  to the  end  of
 the  war.  You  -- you leave  in 1946?
 
A: 1945,  yeah.
 
Q: Were  you  glad  to get  out  of Germany?
 
A: Yes.  I was  glad  to get  out  of the  Ar
my.  In fact,  I made  
the  mistake of throwing 
everything away.
 
Q: In general had  it been,  asid
e  from  the  war interrogation --
 
A: Well,  I didn't   like  and  don
't  like  the  Army   system  of taking  orders  from  -- you  
know,  you  take  an order  from  the next  high er  up,  and  very  often  the  people  who  
gave  the orders  didn't  know  as 
mu ch  as the  people  who  took  them.
 
Q: {Laughter} That's  a common  frustration.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: When  you  came  back  to 
the  states, where  did  you  go?
 

A: By th at  time  my  parents had  a school
  in Manchester, Vermont. I very  quickly 
returned to college and  went  to Swarthmore and  spent  the  next  three  and  a half  
years there.
 
Q: Did  you  tell  them  about  wh at
  some  of your  experiences were?
 
A: I probably didn't  talk  ab
out  the  war  for  30 years. 
 
Q: I wanted  to ask  you  about  that.  Becaus
e in the questionnaire that  was  sent  back  it 
was  indicated that  you had  ne
ver  been  interviewed at all?
 
A: No.
 
Q: So that  to me tell
s  of a certain reticence.
 
A: Well,  I certainly didn't  volunteer to be in
terviewed, and  it was  just  something so 
different from  what  anybody else  had experience
d, except  an veteran, that  I just didn't  
want  to talk  about  it,  and  then  maybe
  after  30 years  I started talking about  it.
 
Q: To whom?
 
A: I guess  my wife  and  my parents.
 
Q: Is she  -- does  she  also  -- does  
she  have  a similar history to your  own?
 
A: No.  I was  married
 -- I'm  married twice.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: My first  wife  was  a student at Swarthmore
, and  her father  was  the  head  of the  
Harvard medical school, and  she died  of cirrhosis of the  liver  --
 
Q: Oh,  my.
 
A: -- after  we were  divorced. 
 And  I've  been  married to my current wife  for  35,  
maybe  38 years  now.  She  was  a teacher at Windsor.
 
Q: And  your  son  is -- how 
 many  children do you  have?
 
A: Two  sons.
 
Q: Two  sons.
 
A: One  is the  head  of a school  in Pennsyl
vania, and  the other  one  is a construction 
type.  And  gran dchildren.
 
Q: And  you  have  grandchildren.  How  many?
 
A: Four.
 

Q: Girls,  boys?
 
A: Two  are  adult,  and  they're 1 9  and  20
 from  my oldest son.  And  my youngest son  
has  a -- the  two  older  ones  are girls,  and 
 the  two  younger ones  are  boys,  3 and  8.
 
Q: Did  any  of the  younger generations then  
come  to you and  say  tell  us about  wh at  
happened ?
 
A: My youngest son  got  intere
sted in what  I did  during the  war,  maybe  ten  years  
ago.  But  you  can 't  blame  them. 
I never  talked  about  it,  and  --
 
Q: What  was  your  own  profession?  After 
 you  finished your masters at Swarthmo re, 
what  was  your  career  after  that? What did  you  do?
 
A: I was  the  headmaster of a co-educational boa
rd ing school  for  35 years,  called  the  
Windsor Mountain School.
 
Q: So th e  same  school  
your  parents had  founded?
 
A: The  school  was  founded by my  parents, ye s. And  then after  I came  to Washington 
I was  the  head  of a number
  of small  schools. Then  I retired when  I was  78,  or 
something like  that.
 
Q: Is there  -- have  you 
 been  back  to Germany?
 
A: Once.  I had  -- didn't  want  to go back 
 to Germany and always 
 avoided going  back  
to Germany.  They  had  a cerem
ony to honor  my  parents, and  
I felt  I should 
 go to that,  
so I was  back  in Germany once.
 
Q: At the  school?
 
A: No,  it was  in -- yeah,  it was  at the  sch
ool  too,  but the  ceremony was,  I think,  in 
Hamburg.
 
Q: Is there  anything that  I did  not  ask  
about  that  you think  was  important to note?
 
A: We talked  so much  I ca
n 't  remember what  I said.
 
Q: {Laughter}
 
Q: Well,  you  know,  one  interview can  neve
r  capture everything, and  I still  have  a 
lot  of questions about, about  the  whole  ex perience, the  details, th e  training at Camp  
Ritchie and,  you  know,  those experiences, but
  at the same  time  I realize I'm  asking  
these  so many  decades later, a
nd  it's  hard  to remember.
 
A: It's  very  hard  to rememb er, and  
particularly the  war. Sometimes I don't  know  
whether I've  seen  it in the  
movies or whether I've
  really  experience
d it because it's  so 
long ago.
 

Q: Yeah.  Yeah,  I mean, 
 that's  one  of the  
-- that's  o n e of the challenges that  we face  
when   we conduct 
these interviews --
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: -- is that  we know  that 
 so much  time  ha s  passed, a
nd so  much  more  is k n own  
now  than   was  known  at the  time. But this 
 looks  like  a very  interesting book,  the  
one  of the 79th  Division.  Have  you  ha
d  many  reunions that  you've gone  to?
 
A: No. I just  went  to -- as I told  you,  I wa
s  not  very pleased with 
 the  military so for  
about  15,  20 years  I had no contact with  
any  -- you're  free  to look  at the  book.
 
Q: Thank  you.  I will.  I will. Why  don't  we
 turn  this off.  Hang  on a second.  I will  
say  this  concludes our interview with  Mr. 
 Eric  Heinz  Bondy  on August  30th,  2012. 
Thank  you  very,  very  much.
 
A: You  are  very  well  behaved, guys.
 
Q: They  were.  They  were  very  well  behaved.
