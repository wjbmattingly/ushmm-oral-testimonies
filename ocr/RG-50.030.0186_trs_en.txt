REIF-LEHRER 
 
October 24, 1989
 
 
Q: Would you...  Uh, welcome.  And would you tell me  your name , please?  

 

A: My name  is Liane Reif-Lehrer. 

 

Q: And where and when were you born?  

 

A: I was  born in Vienna, Austria, Zweitebitziek, on November 14th, 1934. 

 

Q: Uh, tell me  about your parents.  Uh, what did your father do?  

 

A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to
 Vienna to go to medical school.  And then uh 
went on, after he finished medical school, to
 study dentistry; and then opened a dental 
practice uh in Vienna.  Uh, my mother was also
 born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think, 
probably for some frivolous reason--like a vaca
tion, or to buy clothes or something like that. 
And some how me t my father.  Uh, and they 
were married; and uh my mother stayed in 
Vienna.  And uh they uh...I guess 
things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's 
practice off the ground.  And I think during t
hose early years my mother helped out-- 

answering the phone and...and things like that.  But 
then after that, she really did not work as 
long as we were still in Europe.  And my fath
er had a rather thriving practice, uh which was 
inside our house.  There were two apartmen
ts that ...and they had the wall broken down 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
2
 
 
between them.  So that basically we had this...  I guess there were fourteen rooms on one 
level.  At one end was my father's practice, 
and the other end were our living quarters.  Uh, 
so I guess it...it was fairly thriving.  And I think there was a fair
 amount of uh...oh, social 
activity--in the sense of going to the opera, a
nd uh...  I don't know.  Maybe some  theater. 
And uh I think once a week they went to so
me relatives' and played cards.  And uh, you 
know, probably the usual kind of thing that any 
mi ddle-class family in that era would have 
been doing. 
 

Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early year
s?    Uh, you were born in '34.  What do you 
reme mber of your very early childhood?  
 

A: Well, my memories are very spotty.  Uh, 
but uh...I remember ...I remember my father's 
office, and I reme mber my own room and I re
member parts of the layout of the apartment 
quite well.  Not all of it.  I mean, I don't th
ink I could draw you a map.  But I uh...I remember 
the dining room, for example; and I remember
 the kitchen.  Uh, I think I liked messing 
around in the kitchen a lot.  And I liked...  We
 had a cook, and she let me  uh play around in 

there and do things; although I seem to remember
 my mother didn't like me to do that.  Uh 
,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and 
help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother 
was not too thrilled about that.  Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act... 

We...there were other uh...  I hate to use this 
word, but "servants," in the house.  I mean, 
people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and di
d all those things; and I think they were 
sort of fun for me .  And I reme mber a fair 
number of...of things.  Like when they uh ...they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186

used to roll up the carpets and the runners
 and take them up to--I don't know, the roof 
maybe--to beat them with those old-fash
ioned paddles.  And when they rolled up... 
Especially there were long hallways in the apartment.  So we had these long runners, and 
they would let me stand or sit on one end; and 
as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a 
ride.  Uh, and then when they folded 
the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, 

getting swung in the sheets.  U
h, and I reme mber getting rides on brooms.  You know, I'd put 
my feet on the two parts of the broom and they
 would sweep along.  Uh, 
so I remember that. 
I...I remember ...uh I remember one of my 
governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my 

room, actually.  I think in my room there wa
s my uh sort of crib and...and ma ybe...  I only 
remember that there was a crib, although as I 
look back on it by the age four it's hard to 
believe that I still slept in a crib.  But who 
knows?   And then right in...in uh line with that, 
there was this other bed where I think the govern
ess slept.  Uh,  and I remember quite well 
the layout of my room and where there was a dr
esser, and I think there was a furry animal, 
and...and where the window was.  Uh, I'm not su
re I remember terribly much else about 
those early uh years.   
 

Q: What about people?   What 
about your parents?   What do you remember about them?   What 
do you remember about...?   I believe you had a brother.  Tell me about it. 
 

A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember ve
ry much from the Vienna era about people. 
Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I 
think I remembered my father when I was 
younger.  But then, at some  stage when I was 
probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
4
 
 
were already in the United States long since by that time.  But my mother always had a large 
picture of my father on her be
d, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at 
that picture and suddenly realized that the act
ual memory of my father that I remembered 

having then had been replaced by the me mory of this photograph. 
 

Q: OK.  Let's get a sense of...of...  You described a child having a good time in the house.  Uh, 
as the Hitler years progressed and we move to
ward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh 
can you tell me  what happened?  
 

A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about
 from my first-hand recollection is about 
Kristallnacht, because I remember  that with 
incredible clarity.  Uh, my mother was holding 
me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto 
her skirt.  Uh, and there was this knock at 
the door.  And uh I re...I mean, I remember that
 it was a very tense time and it was in the 

evening.  And uh my mother went to...  We  had 
one of these peepholes that has like a metal 
cover, you know, that you push aside; and 
my mother pushed it aside, and somebody 
whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass.  And then the superintendent called 

out, "Don't worry for life.  It's just me; let us  in."  I thought two men 
came in, but my brother 

tells me actually were five or six.  Uh and th
en, I mean, they were very unpleasant.  And uh I 
think they kind of totally ignored all three 
of us, actually.  They kind of rumma ged through 
the house.  And I...and I...they took a lot of th
ings; but the only thing that I specifically 
remember them taking is that the cook...  There 
was a white closet in the kitchen where they 
kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-rela
ted things.  And...and there was a uh...a tall 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
5
 
 
can from these things called "pastilles," which cam
e in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind. 
And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook us
ed to save coins in it, groschen--which are 
sort of like pennies.  And that 
must have been important to me, because I remember that they 
took that.  And I was not disturbed...I don't re
member being disturbed about them taking 
anything else.  But I remember being distur
bed about them taking that.  And uh...so that 

evening is sort of like a frozen still photogra
ph in my mi nd.  But I...you know, then it blacks 
out on either side of that.  Uh, and one of the th
ings that I just recently uh said to my brother-

-who has often asked me , you know, "Why do you 
think backwards instead of living your 
life forwards? "   Uh, and I...I mean, that's a ha
rd question to answer.  But about a year ago, 
when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter.  I 

suddenly realized that I guess...I guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that 

era, it's perhaps a little easier.  I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what 

happened and then what happened.  And for me, I 
said to him, I feel as though there's kind of 
a black box there that I'm maybe constantly tr
ying to pry open but I can't  get it open.  And uh 
I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I some how...I 

suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person 

or some conversation or something there would 
just trigger something that would help to...to 
remi nd me of...  But I...I can't  get it back.  
And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a 
lot about how...how much my father wanted
 a daughter and how fond he was of me , 
and...and so on.  And I sort of 
would like to try to go back and remember what that 
relationship mi ght have been like, but I can't.  I can't  bring it back.

Q: Alright.  You've moved to 
your father.  And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on 
either side of Kristallnacht.  You had starte
d...your parents had started looking for papers to 
come  to America, or a way to come  to America?   What happened?  
 
A: Uh, my father uh...  And I can't  seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father 
was one of uh quite a few children.  And some  
people say five, some  people say seven, some 

people say nine.  I don't know.  I have a feeling 
it was either seven or nine.  Uh, and there 
actually was a set of twins in the family.  Bu
t, anyway, two of the siblings had come  to 
America, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's.  And there had been some talk in the family, 

apparently, of comi ng to America to join them.  Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk 

got more.  Uh, but apparently my father's 
feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old. 
I don't know English.  Uh, I woul
dn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America 
without extensive re-training.  How can I...?   And, you know, I have such a good practice 

here.  How can I just get up and go? "  Uh, well,
 my father never made it to Kristallnacht. 
Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late
 that they really had to leave.  And so, uh on 
the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother a
nd father left the house in the morning to 
do a number of chores.  And one of the chores 
was to pick up our passports, which they did. 
Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they pa
rted to do some separate things; and they 
were supposed to meet, I think, either at home 
or at the home of this cousin where they 
sometimes played cards.  But anyway, they were
 supposed to meet in the afternoon.  And my 
father never came back.  And he was found 
dead at the bottom of
 a uh...a four-story 
stairwell.  And the story over the years has 
been that he had been getting increasingly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
7
 
 
depressed--especially because in August he ha
d to close his practice and he was no longer 
allowed to to work.  Uh, and a lot of people we
re committing suicide.  And so I kind of grew 
up with uh...I mean, a very strange thing.  I m
ean, it was kind of talked about, that he had 
committed suicide.  Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and 

she...she was very adamant that I never tell 
anybody about that.  And I think, really, that 
must have been a a very difficult thing for 
me  as I was growing up.  But anyway, you know, 
I didn't really think about it very much uh either.  As an adult now, as I look back and I ask 

people, "Well, how...? "  You know, and I hear fr
om other survivors about the horrible things 
that were being done to people, my question 
has been:  "How do you know that he jumped? "  
And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don'
t know that he jumped.  But he was very 
depressed, and a lot of people were committi
ng suicide."  And uh...and my brother also 
provides a very rational uh reason, which is that
 he probably thought that the family would 
be better off without a male.  Uh, and so it seems 
likely that...that he did this.  But I can't  help 
always wondering, with all the other stories 
I hear about, could some body have pushed him?  

I mean, nobody would know the difference.  So I don't know what the answer to that is. 

But, anyway, he never came back. 
 

Q: OK.  So you and your mother now were le
ft--this is at the end of September 1938--uh 
without a father and husband. 
 

A: And by the way, those passports that my
 mother got that morning were taken on 
Kristallnacht.  So... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
8
 
 
 
Q: OK.  So we move from Se
ptember to November.  Kristallnacht happens.  You are without 
passports.  What did your mother do?   What did you do?   All of you?  
 

A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try 
to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately 
did.  I think there was probably a lot of co
rrespondence with the Klinghoffer family, which 
was my father's sister in New York.  Uh, a
nd at some point--and I don't remember when this 
was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house. 

And my...my mother was really in, I think she wa
s in really bad straights after my father's 
death.  Uh, and this friend of ours who was a 
lawyer came  and kind of supervised, I think, 
the packing of this van. Uh, and I don't reme mber
 what went into it; but I do remember what 
came out of it at the other end. 
 And it was ...  (Laughter)  I mean, it was just a ridiculous 
assortment of some useful but many totally 
useless uh objects.  But anyway, this van was 

packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a 
lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and 
it was in storage for three years until we finally 
came there.  Uh, so I...I do think I remember 
the day the van was being packed.  But then again, there is... 
 

Q: What did you do?   The van was packed; 
and then what did you and your mother do, 
specifically? 
 

A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news
, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from 
Hamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as 
they call it here.  Uh, and because people were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
9
 
 
not allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars 
per person--uh I think we and a lot of people 
like us, who mi ght not have bought first class 
tickets, uh bought first class tickets. Because 
you couldn't take the money anyway, so you 
mi ght as well, you know, spend it on this.  Uh, 
and so we...we got these tickets and we got 
these visas, uh which also cost a fair am
ount of money.  Uh, a
nd on...in early May of 1939, 
we took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat.  Now, I don't remember anything about 

the voyage except, I think, I remember two things. 
 One is that there's ki
nd of a sense of fear 
that I still have whenever I have to uh go thr
ough any kind of checkpoints.  And I think that 
part of that must have started at that time. 
 And from what my brother tells me it was very 
scary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, 
you know, were you going to get on?   Wa s 
some thing going to happen before you get on got on?
  And so on.  Uh, and the other thing is 
that I remember and still have a little white sun-
suit uh that I that I wa
s wearing on the ship; 
and I just happen to remember--again, it's like 
a still photograph of me in this little uh white 
sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. (Laughter)  Uh, 

and then I don't remember anything else from from the ship.  But uh...I mean, I know that the 

ship, of course, came to Cuba a
nd we were not allowed in.  Uh, and my brother tells me that 
uh this lawyer, whose name  was [Kleinfeld (ph)
], uh actually had already been in Cuba at 
that the time that the boat docked.  And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us.  Uh... 
 

Q: Who was the lawyer?   Wa s he a connection with you personally, or with your family?  

 

A: Well, we were quite fr iendly with them then 
when we came to the United States.  But I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
10
 
 
we were friends...I'm not sure that our parents 
were such good friends.  I have a feeling that 
the friendship mi ght have come about thr
ough the friendship between their son and my 
brother, but I'm not sure about that.  But they
 certainly figured in our lives.  I mean, I...I 
reme m...they were always talked about.  U
h, so he came to the ship, to...to see us, 
apparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the ship is...is 

of course well-known, historically.  And the ship
 was turned back, and we went to France. 
And that's when I start to have much more coherent memories. 
 

Q: Tell us what happened when the ship docked.  What did you do?   

 

A: You mean, when we got back to France?  

 

Q: When you got back to France, yes. 

 

A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little town in uh centrally...central France called Loudun. 

 

Q: How did you get there?   Do you reme mber?  

 

A: I don't remember getting to Loudun.  But uh in 
Loudun, we were put up in this hotel.  And I 
guess there must have been a group of about twen
ty of us from the St. Louis.  Uh, and I 
remember this hotel, and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in 

front of the hotel.  But in my
 adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to Loudun-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
11
 
 
-the square didn't look nearly as large as I re
membered it.  (Laughter)  Uh, uh the things I 
remember from the hotel in Loudun:  uh, I remember where our room was--it was a little 
room on the side.  And uh...and I remember some  
fairly dramatic things.  I remember having 
this little so-called boyfriend that I guess I play
ed with. Uh...  What I remember much more 
dramatically are two things.  Uh, well, fi rst off,
 there are some trivial things I remember.  I 
remember my mother was always very neat and clean.  Uh, and I remember that my mother 

was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness 
in this hotel, and that there were cats running 
around on the food preparation tables.  Uh, and 
I also remember that she was absolutely 
horrified because there was no place to bathe or 
shower in the hotel.  There were toilets, but 
no, you know, bathing rooms.  And so my mother
 apparently asked the woma n who ran the 
hotel where the town bathing facilities were; 
and the woma n apparently didn't know.  And 
my mother was totally horrified by that.  A
nd uh, oh, for years later my mother always did 
talk about "You don't know how much perfume th
is lady wore," and so on.  So I remember 
trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around.  And I remember uh...I remember 

once these two older girls sort of held me a
nd ma de me  watch while they were killing uh a 

chicken that was going to be used for dinner.
  And...and that was really...I remember that 

with great horror.  You know, I didn't want to watc
h that, and they sort of forced me .  Uh, so 
I remember that.  But the more dramatic things 
that I remember is that one morning we woke 
up and there uh was this incredible commotion 
outside.  And there were uh shots; and, I 
mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were.  And the Germans had 

come  in to Loudun.  And uh so, for I guess what 
must have been a couple of weeks we lived 
in this hotel, and uh a lot of the German sold
iers either...  I don't know if they also lived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
12
 
 
there, but they certainly were around all the tim
e and they had meals th
ere.  And one of the 
things that I remember, to this day, being incr
edibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I 
was only about five and a half or so--uh is that
 I was...  First of all, you have to understand I 
was always a very "good girl," and I always di
d everything I was told.  Uh, and I was told 
that under no circumstances was I to let on that 
I spoke German.  Now, how they expected to 
perpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French.  My brother had had 
French lessons in Vienna, so he probably di
d have some  comma nd of French.  But I was 
kind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me.  And I remember 

very clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, "Je ne comprends pas.  Je ne 

comprends pas." And I remember also thinking 
that there was some thing very funny about, I 
guess, having always been taught that you're 
not supposed to lie and here I was being 
instructed to tell this out-and-out lie.  A
nd also nobody explained to me why I was telling 
this lie.  And so I was really very perplexed, 
I think, by this whole thing.  But I did exactly 

what I was told.  And I remember the soldiers
 saying all these things to me--which I, of 
course, understood perfectly--but just saying "Je ne
 comprends pas."  So that was one thing. 

Another thing...  Oh, even before that time, 
there was one other thing I remember.  There 
was an air raid one night, and I...somehow I...I 
got away from my mother and I ran outside. 

And they had to come and retrieve me.  I 
some how thought it was interesting, or fun, or 
whatever.  Uh, but anyway, uh...so 
for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this hotel in 
Loudun, in the morning the Germans would 
do these...I don't know.  Whatever you call 
them--you know, ma neuvers or some thing.  Th
ey'd march around the hotel in formation, 
with their big boots and things.  And uh my mo
ther and my brother and I would watch from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
13
 
 
the window.  And there was one soldier...and I 
don't remember his face, but I remember, I 
remember his form.  And I remember that he 
had sort of wavy sandy-co
lored hair.  And I...I 
can't  help wondering, in retrospect, ma ybe he didn't even know I was Jewish.  I me an, or 
ma ybe he did.  I don't know.  I always sort of in the past assume d that he knew.  But now I 

think, "Well, you know, ma ybe he didn't know." 
 Who knows?   But he threw me  candies uh 
on a number of occasions.  And my mother was 
sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them 
anyway.  And here I am.  And th
en, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me  a 
little doll.  And I think that interaction through;
 I think that interaction very, very strongly 

colored my life attitudes.  U
h, because I think...I think even then, you know, I some how must 
have known that these were the bad guys.  Bu
t this guy, who I have a feeling mi ght have 
been you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was ju
st nice, you know; and he was nice to me . 
Uh, and...and ma ybe I jump to conclusions on ve
ry naïve grounds; but several years later, 
when I came to the United States, and kids
 would and...and their parents ask me , you know, 
really ridiculous things to say to a child
--like, uh, "How do you lik
e America? "  And, "Do 
you hate the Germans? "  And I remember alwa
ys saying, "No, I don't hate the Germans. 
There are good Germans, and there are bad Germans."  And I ...I mean maybe this is 

simplistic, but I've always thought that it really 
had to do with this one soldier that somehow 
made me get a...a very sensible attitude, 
even though I was so young, about the differences 
between people.  And I've always sort of very fondly reme mbered that.   
 

Q: OK.  So you were in Loudun, uh and you had th
ese these memories.  Uh, how long were you 
in Loudun?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
14
 
 
 
A:  Uh, we must have been in Loudun for some where between nine months and a year. 

 

Q: What is your perception of your mother during that period?  

 

A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I ha
d realized this more when she was still around--
my mother must have really, basically, been
 an incredibly strong person to have gone 
through that.  Because when I try to think back on it, I often think I...you know, I don't think 

I could have done the things that she did. 
 

Q: That's not what I'm asking.  I'm asking what your me mory of her... 

 

A: I...I know what you're asking, and I...I really
 had to give that preamble; because my...my 
sense of my mother during those years, and...and 
many years later, is that that she somehow 
never got it all together except for the practical
 things.  That she some how was so...I'm not 
sure what the right word is, but maybe almost
 frantic.  I mean, she was... And who knows?   I 
mean, maybe I would have been the same way.  But I mean, she really...she was in mourning 

for my father for the rest of her life.  
And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84.  I 
guess she was a woma n who already had learne
d something like five languages, but she 

could not learn French.  You know, it was not just
 there at that time.  Uh, and I think uh...  I 
wish I could remember the German word that that
 she used to use a lot.  That she was just 
uh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know wh
at to do, you know, with herself or what was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
15
 
 
going on, and so on.  Uh, and I think the...  What 
she had always told me was that after the 
Germans came into Loudun, that my brother--who wa
s uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, 
uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that 
he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether 
she left or not he was leaving.  Now, I'm not sure
 whether my brother really said that in those 
terms.  What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some 

refugees in the hotel, and that it was decided th
at they should get the He
ll out of there.  Uh, 
and there were...there was only one family, or
 possibly a family and one other person, who 
decided not to go.  And that family uh is the fa
mily of the two sisters that I showed you the 
picture of before.  And it was a mi stake, 
because they didn't get here until 1947.  But 
anyway, so I don't remember that.  What I do re
member is that one night we left everything 
that we owned--which was not much, but we
 did have, you know, suitcases and valises and 
stuff.  We  left everything, and we left in 
the dark of night.  And I think I have a...my 
recollection is that it was like mi dnight, uh with 
nothing except my brother's violin.  And this 
group of us went; and some how, in a way that wa
s not quite kosher, got 
on a train that went 
to the south of France.  Uh, and then uh so
 I remem.... I remember walking to the train 
station in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of 
this trip.  But what my brother tells me 
is that uh when we got to the border--which
 I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through 
this uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, 

the lower echelon people in these offi ces were s
till French people rather than Germans.  And 
apparently one woma n in this group of twenty went up to this woma n in this office, and said, 

"Look, you know, I've really got to get across th
e border, because I'm here and my husband 
is already on the other side."  And so this
 woma n said, "Yeah, alright."  You know, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
16
 
 
stamped her whatever you needed to get stam
ped.  And then she turned and said, "You 
know, that's also the situation for all these 
other people.  They also have somebody else 
waiting on the other side."  And apparently this
 woma n, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, 
"Yeah, yeah.  OK."  And so we all got across. 
 And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and 
now that's where my me mory picks up again.  Uh, 
the first...I think the first night we slept in 
the railroad station; and I...I remember, I th
ink I slept on a...on a scale.  You know, the kind 
of thing you weigh the baggage on.  Uh, and th
en the next night--and I thought it was just 
one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an 
abandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess 
it was stone.  And uh...and I reme mber waking 
up the first morning we were there and being 
all black and blue and sore uh from just 
sleeping on this...on this stone.  Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for 

six weeks and that people graduated.  You know
, gradually people found places to live, and 
so you kind of got to move to the better seats. 
 And then, apparently, the...the most desirable 
place was around the periphery of the arena.  
There were these uh...what I call orange crate 
make-shift beds that had straw mattresses in th
em.  And so that was... 
for the last few days 
we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on 
those.  And then, uh some how there was a... 
this Jewish committee that found...you know, was he
lping the refugees.  And they found uh a 
uh place that I think had been a pool hall, and th
ere was a small room that must have been... 
I mean, it was really not a very 
big room.  It mi ght have been ma ybe twenty feet by twenty 
feet, or twenty-five feet by tw
enty-five feet.  Certainly not...not any bigger than that.  Uh, 
and there were about thirty women who slept in 
that room.  And then, right above that, there 
was another room where all the...the men slept.  And I don't remember there being any other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
17
 
 
fema le children except for me .  And I could be
 wrong about that, but I have no recollection 
of anything but adults.  And my brother slept ups
tairs with the men; and I have a feeling he 
mi ght have been the only, you know, mi nor in that
 group as well.  But then, I mean, this is 
where I really start to remember.  I mean, I 
remember this place well.  And actually, I went 
back there in 1963 to visit it.  And uh so we sl
ept in this room; and at night we had these 
straw mattresses, and we'd line them up.  It 
was body to body on the floor.  Uh, and then in 
the morning, they would get piled up against the 
side of the room.  And there were all these 
sort of orange crates, you know, really wooden ki
nd of crates that got 
pulled out.  And we sat 
on those and...and ate off them and...and so on.  And 
uh so we were in this room for...I don't 
know, quite a long time.  And I began going to 
school.  My first year of schooling was in 
Limoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom.  And I still 

have my three notebooks from that year.  A
nd I remember the teacher, uh who I remember 
as a quite not very pleasant woma n.  And uh she 
seemed very old to me them.  I mean, she 
had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a ve
ry harshly drawn back with a bun; and she 

sat up on a dias.  And uh, I mean, I remember qu
ite a few things from this; but two things 
that stand out in my mi nd.  Uh one is that 
every morning she would come  down every aisle 
of seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I 

guess.  And uh I don't think it ever occurred to 
her that, by doing that, that she was actually 
spreading this.  And so sure enough, one da
y I came home and one of the wome n spotted 

that I had lice.  And I mean, my recollection is
 that there must have been five women every 
day who kind of attacked me  and washed my
 hair with kerosene, and then combed it 
me rcilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine
-toothed combs until they cleaned my head 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
18
 
 
out.  So that was kind of horrible.  The other 
thing that I remember is I was ...I was very 
anxious to be very good in school, and I di
d very well at almost everything except 
penmanship.  I mean, penmanship was so stressed 
in that thing, in that system or whatever; 
and I remember this teacher constantly af
ter me, because on French r's and s's you're 
supposed to have this little bump, you know at th
e top.  And I could never quite get that 

right.  I mean, she did...she accepted all the others.  I've never had a good penmanship, but 

she accepted everything else.  But she was c
onstantly after me about that little, you know, 
squiggle that I couldn't get right.  So I remember
 that.  The other thing that I remember is 
that everything was, in terms of food, was in
credibly difficult to get.  And so uh I...my 
brother was too old to get mil
k, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh 

something that sort of looked like a straighten
ed version of a coke bottle.  And my mother 
insisted that we share that.  And so, every 
morning we would go down and collect this... this 
milk.  Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that 

I really have added to that 
a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I 
got sent into bakeries to beg for bread.  
And the line was, "I've got uh...I have...I have 
money, and I have ration coupons.  But uh..." 
 Or ma ybe we didn't have ration coupons, 
whatever it was, you know.  "...we really need 
bread."  And so that was my role.  And I 
would...that bread was not only for us, but it would be shared with some  of the other people. 

And when I was interviewing my brother last
 year--because I wrote an article about this--
I...I said to my brother, "Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must 

have been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?"  And my brother, who is a very 

practical person, looked me straight in the eye a
nd said, "It wasn't  demeaning.  It was bread." 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
19
 
 
And uh...but some how I can't  feel that way 
about it.  And uh...and I guess...I mean, I guess 
we shared duties in that he had to...all the
...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when 
things had to be packed or when you had to go to
 an office to ask about visas, I me an, he got 
to do all that.  And, of course, I was too young to
 do that.  But uh but I got this horrible chore 
to do, because I was younger and cuter I guess.  
Uh, so I reme mber that.  Uh, and then I 
remember very clearly, two times uh...I th
ink you were allowed a pound of potatoes per 
month per person and one egg per month per 
person, according to these ration coupons.  And 
so, one time my mother heard that there were 
eggs out in this farm, which was...I me an, I 
remember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles.  And we came home 

with these eggs, and my mother opened them 
and they were all rotten.  And then another 
time, we heard that there were potatoes. 
 And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though 
we walked for just ages and we came home w
ith these three pounds of potatoes.  And I guess 
we were just... this is like such a feast that
 uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of 
potatoes.  And I think we just ate them all 
up.  Uh, and then there was a...probably the most 
wonderful birthday of my life 
happened in this period.  I don't know how my mother pulled 
this off;  but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag.  And in this paper 

bag was--I don't remember, I think it mi ght have been like a peach, or...and one other big 

fruit and some  dried fruits. And it was probably 
the nicest present I've ever gotten.  So, uh so 
I remember that.  And...and the two other dramatic
 things that I remember from that era is 
one that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah 
in the mi dst of this.  And I don't remember 
much about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was 
given a...a silk...a beautiful blue silk string 
bag--which we had for years--and it was filled 
with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
20
 
 
goodies that were kind of nice.  
Uh so that was one thing I remember.  And the other thing--
and we still have one of these, and it's in my son'
s car, as a matter of fact.  And I just said to 
my son the other day, "Don't you ever lose th
is!"  Uh, some where, after...I don't know 
whether it was weeks or months, uh two things 
happened.  First of all--and I can't  remember 
which happened first--but one day these two guys walked down.  It was sort of a mild hill, 
the street we were on; and these two guys ca
me  down the hill, and each of them was holding 
one end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth.  And it
...I mean, I still have it.  So I can tell you with 
with great accuracy that this is the...the worst qua
lity fabric I have ever felt in my life.  I...I 
don't think it had an iota of warmth in it.  Bu
t uh it was such a...I remember that nice feeling 
of these guys comi ng with this blanket cloth, a
nd they just had like a knife or something. 
And they just stood there and kind of, you know
, pulled off...I don't know, ma ybe a yard and 
a half.  Uh, and everybody kind of 
got a square of this, and...and we got two squares.  Uh and 
that was, you know, that was like ma nna from heav
en.  Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is 
in...in ...  One of them got lost some where; but th
e other one is in my son's car.  Uh, and then 
I guess somewhere along those uh months, the little
 house right next door to where we were 
staying became free.  And I don'
t know why we had the good fortune, but the little place next 
door was a one...I think it was just a one story 
place, and it had two rooms.  And there was a 
smaller inner room, and then this larger outer 
room.  And my brother and mother and I were 
given that little inner room.  And the outer room
 was kind of divided in half.  And the back 
part of it was given to these two sisters who we
re ma rried to two brothers.  And one of the 
brothers was named [Lutz (ph)].  I don't remember his last name.  And he was almost blind. 
He had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of
 his time cutting out those kind of leather belt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
21
 
 
loops that, you know, you hook one into the other 
and ma ke belts.  And I...I reme mber we 
used to help him do that sometimes.  And he di
d that in the outer part of this room, which 
was like his workspace.  Uh, so those are, thos
e are some  of my...  Oh, there was one other 
nice thing that I remember from Limoges.  There was a...a carpenter that we somehow got to 
know.  Uh, and I think he was kind of a ve
ry me llow-looking guy, with ma ybe reddish kind 
of hair and beard.  And you know, he seemed old 
to me then; but in retrospect he probably 
was thirty-five or some thing.  Uh but he ma de
 a wonderful little set of toy furniture for me 
out of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces
 of wallpaper on the chairs, you know, to 
make it look as though they were upholstered.  
And uh I certainly had those for years and 

years after that, and always treasured them gr
eatly.  Uh, so I guess those are uh...  Oh.  One 
thing that I didn't me ntion, uh and this was fr
om Loudun.  We  went from Loudun to Paris, to 
try to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939.  Uh, and I remember 

there was an air raid.  My mother and my brot
her and I were in a hotel.  There was an air 
raid, and for some reason we didn't hear 
it and we didn't wake up.  Some body came  and 
banged on our door and woke us up, 
and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the mi ddle 

of this huge boulevard.  And what I reme mber is
 that the smell of dog 
doo in that air raid 
shelter was just overwhelming; and I remember th
at sort of scary fee
ling of being down there 
and the sirens and the commotion.  And then...and then we were told to go back to Loudun, 

and that we would get visas in, you know, what
ever it was--six weeks or something.  But 

then, of course, the war officially started.  The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never 

got back there.  But...but that I do remember--being 
in Paris in the air raid shelter.  So then 
uh...  Well, I remember a lot about school.  I 
mean, I remember doing design in school.  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
22
 
 
guess that was one of my favorite subjects.  
It was uh...it was...it was a very controlled kind 
of art class.  Design, it was...it was not the 
kind of thing that kids do now.  And you know, 
you colored in and out the little squares and things. 
 
Q: Did you have any friends?  

 

A: You know, that's a very interesting ques
tion.  I don't remember having any friends in 
Limoges.  I must have known some  of the kids in
 my class.  My brother, I think, had a very 
nice sort of older boy, who was a pianist, w
ho took him under his wing and I think did a lot 
for him.  But I don't remember...I don't remember
 any friends.  And I...I
 think it was a very 
lonesome  time for me .  Uh, but I, you know, so
me how I...I played, and I played with the 
little doll furniture; and I uh...I think I spent a lot of time in school, and I think my mother 

played with me .  And I...I do reme mber one thing, actually.  And I think this was in 

Limoges, but I'm not sure.  Uh, and I think this 
has also stayed with me for life.  I remember 
my brother was playing with a group of kids 
his age, and they were running.  Maybe they 
were playing hide-and-seek, or some thing.  A
nd I was trying to keep 
up with them.  And I 
fell, and I reme mber having these enormous scabs on...on both knees for a long  time.  And 

I...I...I know I've always had a fear of falling. A
nd when our kids were small, I...I just found 
it intolerable to see them run. 
 And so I would always let my husband take care of that, you 
know; and I would sort of turn 
the other way.  Because I didn't want to inhibit them.  But uh 
I...I remember that day, I remember t
hose bloody horrible knees.  And...and you know, and 
uh...but I don't reme mber having any little friends of my own.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
23
 
 
 
Q: Why...  When did you leave Limoges, and why?  

 

A: Uh, we had been in touch with my father's 
sister and her children, and they were trying very 
hard to get us visas.  And apparently we would 
get a visa; the visas, I guess, expired in fairly 
short periods.  And so we would... apparently, 
we would get a visa 
and there would be no 
ship, or we couldn't get to the ship.  And th
en there would be a ship, but no visa.  And...but 
apparently some how things came together, and we
 left  and went to Marseilles.  And again, I 
thought that was just for a couple 
of days; but my brother tells me we were there for several 
weeks.  Uh, and I don't remember Marseilles at a
ll.  But apparently my brother did a lot of uh 
leg work there, and it was a matter of just st
anding in line after line after line.  And then, 
finally, everything worked out. 
 You know, we had to get an entry visa for Spain, and an 
entry visa for Portugal, and an exit visa for Fr
ance; and it had to be done in the right order, 
because, you know, one couldn't be had without th
e other one first.  And apparently there 
was an incredible amount of... of red tape 
and bureaucracy and waiting lines, and there was 
no food; and it was just a me ss.  And I don't 
remember any of that.  The only thing I 
remember quite clearly is getting on a train 
one night and going through Spain.  Now I don't 
remember...I didn't remember, until my brother 
told me, that we stopped I guess twice in 
cities in Spain.  But I remember sitting in this train, which was...I mean, it was like New 

York during rush hour.  Uh, and I remember that 
it was like this sort of totally chaotic scene. 
I mean, there were wome n in babushkas with 
big baskets; and I think there was one woman 
who had a chicken in her basket, you know, tied 
up with a scarf.  And uh this sort of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
24
 
 
pandemonium scene, and being on this train.  
 And then I don't remember anything else until 
we got on the ship going to the U.S.  Uh, but
 my brother uh has a lovely story about going 
through the uh border check, uh at the Portuguese
 border.  And he said... you know, I mean, 
there was no food on the train.  It was a me ss.
  It was dirty and everything.  And then 

everybody had to get off to go through customs; 
and my brother said, "When we got back on 
the train, it was like a different world.  You c
ould smell fresh rolls, and it was all clean." 
And uh so he...he just, you know...  I mean, when he 
tells that, he just breaks out into this 
wonderful smile.  Uh, and I don't reme mber be
ing in Lisbon.  Apparently, we walked around 
there for two weeks, waiting for this ship--which was called the S.S. Exeter--to sail. 
 

Q: Let's hold it there for a mi nute. 

 

A: We  skipped the St. Louis, huh?   (Laughter) 
 

Q: We'll change tapes.

Q: Let's pick up now.  You are on the train, a
nd you have arrived in Portugal.  Uh, what 
happens when you get off the train?   Where did you go?   What do you reme mber?  
 

A: I don't remember anything until we got on the 
ship.  And then I only remember something 
which is not very pleasant; and that is, th
at I guess on the ship uh there was, you know, 
suddenly food.  I mean, real meals, and...you 
know, and a dining room which looked nice, 
and so on.  But all three of us were seasick, 
essentially, the whole way across the Atlantic. 
And so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some  nice food, uh to really 

avail ourselves of it.  Uh, and 
I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we 
arrived in the U.S.   And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very 

uh...it caused a lot of apprehension 
in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer, 
because in Europe we use these underarm, you know, ma mmoth-sized thermometers.  And 

these people, I think, in white uniforms came ar
ound; and I remember sitting in this big room 
in these chairs, and somebody came around and 
stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's 
mouth.  Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, 
not only because I was little and I...you know, this 
seemed like really weird.  Uh, but as an adult, 
as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was 
very aware that this was still another check poi
nt and that you could still be turned away. 
And I don't know whether some body had told me
 that, you know, if you weren't healthy you 
couldn't come in.  I mean, maybe my mother had 
been talking about that or something.  But I 
remember that arrival time as being a time of
...of apprehension.  And then I reme mber being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
26
 
 
picked up by the relatives.  Uh, and what I...wha
t I remember most dramatically...  Well, first 
of all, there was this...I think it was a big fa
ncy black car.  I mean, not fancy by American 
terms; but to a small kid who, you know, just ha
d not seen anything like this for a long time. 
Uh, and I was sitting in the back seat with my
 mother and my brother.  And my mother was 
next to me, and she was at the window seat; a
nd my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of 
Manhattan, which was not a very nice place--uh, Av
enue D.  And uh as we drove into that 
neighborhood, my mother...I mean, I could hear he
r.  I could hear her very audibly.  My 
mother whispered in German, under her breat
h, some thing like, "Have I suffered so long, 
and come all this way, for this? "   And I think th
at that was...I mean, that struck me as being... 
I mean, in retrospect...  As I think back on it,
 I don't know what I thought at the time.  But in 

retrospect, it seems like such an ungrateful stat
ement to make at that moment.  Because, you 
know, I mean, suddenly we were free.  And 
uh...but I think she was so appalled.  And I 
don't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so a
ppalled, because it surely must have been 

better than, you know, what had been in France,
 and so on.  But uh...but anyway, that's ...I 
reme mber her saying that.  And uh so then uh we
 went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was 
Lena Klinghoffer.  Uh she had what was really
 quite a small apartment, and she had five 
children.  And they were grown; but three of th
em were still living in this apartment.  Uh, 
and Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were
 living at home; and the youngest daughter, 
Dorothy.  Uh, and some how she ma de the ki
ds double up.  And...and so my brother and my 
mother and I got one tiny bedroom, and we act
ually lived there with her for about three 

months.  And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on. 

Uh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal 
things happened in my Aunt Lena's house. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
27
 
 
Like uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assume d th
at, because we had been starving for the 
last two years, that we would eat
 anything that was put in front of us.  Well, that was not true 
at all.  My brother and I were the world's fu
ssiest, pickiest eaters.  And you know, and this 

food that was put in front of us was...I me a
n, it was very alien kind of...of food.  Uh, and so 
we...we...and probably our stomachs were so sh
runken anyway that we didn't need very 
much.  And so we...we were very...you know, we didn'
t eat a lot of things that were put in 
front of us.  And I think my aunt thought that
 was very peculiar.  And uh uh...and then I...I 
reme mber, uh you know, my mother had always b
een very proud of the fact that she never 
learned to cook, and that she...you know, that ot
her people had done things for her.  And uh, 
of course, she very quickly, when we got out
 apartment, learned how to cook a certain 

number of things.  But uh she would always 
say, "I don't even know how to boil water." 
And then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, 
and the kids were out.  And...and I think my 
mother really...I don't know, she was supposed to
 ma ke some  porridge or some thing.  And 

she really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know.  Hard to believe.  And I don't know; I 

sometimes get the feeling that it was like almo
st, you know, could she really not do this?   I 
mean, how do you get to grow up and not know how 
to do this?   Or was it all a put-up job?  
We ll, I don't know.  Uh, turned out that my 
mother was a very talented lady.  And uh...and 
uh very quickly learned how to do all the thi
ngs that...that were needed.  And I think the 
really sad thing is that uh there was nobody around 
to really guide her about what she should 
do.  And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not
 a wealthy woma n.  And uh so I think it 
was...it was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly
 get some thing going.  And so my mother did 
uh the easiest thing, and the first thing that ca
me  her way.  And she spent the whole rest of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186

her life working as a sewing machine operator in
 a factory.  Which was kind of very heavy 
work, uh but I think...  And she's a very hard 
worker, but...  And I think it was not so much 
the hard work that bothered her; but I thi
nk she was...she was very, very bothered by the 
kinds of people that she met in the factory, and 
she felt totally alien from those people.  You 
know, they uh...  I mean, she was...she ma de ac
quaintances very easily, but she didn't make 
friends very easily.  Uh, and I think the people th
at she tended to make real friendships with, 
insofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from Vienna, or other places 
like that, who sort of...you know, where they could 
talk about what had been, or whatever it 
was.  Uh, and she just found the conditions in 
the factory appalling.  Uh, I me an she was so 
...first of all, she was so European and so fo
rmal.  And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that 

people called her by her first name.  I m
ean, nobody every would have done that.  You 
know, she was "Frau Dr. Reif," and not, you know... 
 And all of a sudden, 
she's "Klara."  Uh, 
she would come home, and sometimes...  I th
ink one time she even cried, because she 
walked into an office and some guy was sitting at 
the desk with his feet up; and he didn't take 
his feet off the desk when she walked in.  
Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way. 
And uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thi
ng to her was the kind of language that 
people used in the factory.  I mean, she had ne
ver heard anything like this before.  And so 
she...you know, and...and gradually she learned to 
cope with it, and sh
e kind of...  You know, 
she would kid around with people at work; but
 I don't think she ever, you know, really felt 
happy in that situation.  And as I say, it wasn't  ju
st the hard work, but it was really more that 
she just felt this was not her milieu.  Uh so 
she was a very...I mean, she was a very...basically 
a lonesome , unhappy woma n in ma ny ways in 
her life.  But, on the other hand, on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
29
 
 
surface she was not.  I mean, she...you know, she al
ways kept herself busy and very involved 
in this and that and the other thing.  And she 
learned English, I think, relatively quickly.  Uh, 
and uh she...you know, kept herself active and al
ways knew where all the free concerts and 
free plays were, and took advantage of all 
those cultural things, and ran around to the 
museums.  And uh uh...and so she did all those things.  And I...actually, I should say that 
really was much later; because in the early 
days, life uh... in the early years, life was very 
very difficult.  So after three months, when
 we left my Aunt Le
na's house and got an 
apartment in Brooklyn, uh I think at her first 
job she was earning $15 a week.  And I think 
the rent was $45 a month in this apartment, 
or ma ybe $35 a month.  So
 for...for a long time 
she hardly ate.  I mean, you know, all her mone
y went to paying the rent and feeding us. 
And uh...I mean, she was the usual, you know, 
Jewish mother.  I mean, we came first 
always, everything, you know.  Uh, and she 
gradually...you know, she...I...she never...  I 
mean, she would have been a fantastic bookk
eeper, and she would have been so much 
happier, you know, if some body had led her into
 that when she...once she mastered the 
language.  But they didn't.  So she spent the re
st of the time in the factories.  And uh she...uh 
she really...she did not...  I don't know what to ca
ll it.  I mean, for example, my brother and I 
never worked.  You know, and in retrospect th
at's really weird.  Nobody ever asked us to 
contribute to the family income.  Uh, our 
job was to study; and everything, you know, kind 
of rotated around that.  Uh, so that...and in so
me sense, I mean, you could say that I was a 
spoiled brat once I came here.  Because when
 I wanted to do my homework, I told my 

mother she couldn't wash the dishes until afte
r I finished. Because the noise of the water 
running bothered me .  So here's this lady who'
s been working in the factory and then, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
30
 
 
know, travelling and...and comi ng home.  And I mean, I did help around the house a little bit. 
Uh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and 
she washed the dishes.  I think I sometimes 
dried them.  And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible 

bookkeeping thing every night.  She would not go 
to sleep until the amount of money in her 
change purse matched with this little...she 
had a little book she carried with her.  And 
every...even if it was only two cents, it got wr
itten down; uh and it had to match to the 
penny.  And she would go over it, and over it 
and over it again.  You know, "Where did I 
spend that extra ...? "  Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday. 

And it got to be funny, because in...in later 
years once I remember having a little argument 
with her about how much a certain dress that I 
had cost.  And she just went right back and 
pulled out her book.  "No, that was...you know, it was $13.95!"  (Laughter)  
 

Q: What about uh you, during these years?  

 

A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a...in some sense, a dual personality kid.  I mean, I was...I liked 
to play, and I was kind of, 
you know, fun-loving and...on one side.  Uh, but there was this 
other side of me  that was serious and thoughtfu
l, and I guess introspective and a lot of other 

things.  And...and lonesome .  Uh, not the kind of
 lonesome that...  I wrote a poem about this, 
actually.  More thinking about my mother; but
 not the kind of lonesome  that goes away 
when other people are around, but 
just a kind of inherent feeling of...I don't know.  Uh, I 
mean, only now in recent years I very often th
ink that the only way I can explain it is, you 
know, ma ybe it's what happens to a kid...  I mean, 
what happens when a four year-old kid is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
31
 
 
told that she's never going to see her father
 again.  Especially, you know, having been told 
that...that he was incredibly affectionate to me
.  I mean, what does that do?   What does that 
mean?   Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basi
cally...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to 
sing.  I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes.  And my brother and I love to tell jokes.  Uh 
uh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of
 my brother, which is much more evident I 
think in him than in me.  But there's a very mo
rbid part of me also.  I mean, it's a...I don't, 
you know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but it never goes away.  So uh...and then I think, I 

mean, my mother certainly tried very hard.  Bu
t I think she did and said some things that 
were not really very good for kids growing up.  Sh
e always told us that we were different.  I 
don't think that was very good for us.  Uh, we 
were supposed to be "aristocratic"--you know, 
in quotes.  I mean, that was a myth.  I don't...we 
were not aristocratic in Europe, either.  I 
mean, we were just reasonable, mi ddle-classed 
people.  Uh, but uh so 
I always felt different. 
 I felt different, anyway.  I mean, you know, I come
, here I am at age seven learning my third 
language, and sort of--if you consider the whol
e Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age 
seven.  And I remember comi ng to school in 
the U.S.; and you know, all the little girls and 
boys around me  are, you know, obviously talking 
about me .  And I can't  understand what 
they'r e saying.  Well, I learned English really
 fast, let me tell you.  Uh, but I always felt 
different.  We ll, you know, the more different
 you feel, some how you stay different and you 

become  different.  And uh uh...and to this day, 
I still...I mean, no matter...I mean, I always 
feel different. And I think I never thought 
of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning 
physicist that they interviewed in the [Bost
on] Globe; and he said, "I always felt a little 
different, and it always hurt a little."  And wh
en I read that, I thought, "That's...that's 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
32
 
 
really...that describes me."  Because I think s
ubconsciously, some how I've always wanted to 
belong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatev
er, you know, groups of things.  Not ever 
to belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things 
and I don't want to belong.  I don't uh...I don't 
like being associated with divisive things.  
I mean, I have very mi xed feelings about, you 
know, even about belonging to the...the quality of
 being Jewish, or whatever you want to call 
it.  Uh, because I think that's very divisive. 
 I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that 
have happened in history have happened b
ecause people are...you know, belong to...to some  
of these things.  So that's not the kind of 
belonging that I want.  
But the...belonging to...to, 
for example, uh...  Oh, you know.  Within an 
academic environment, uh people who have 
similar interests or people who like to do some activity or something.  And I always...I mean, 
I'm 55 years old but I still always feel that ther
e is something different about me compared to 
all these other people.  And it always...in some
 strange way, there's a difference.  Uh, and 
then, of course, when I was little, the differe
nce became greatly exacerbated because there 
was such an an emphasis put on learning a
nd studying and so on.  And that was not the 
favorite activity of most of the other kids at
 1092 President Street.  And so the other kids 
would come  home and uh go out and, you know, play
--this, that and the other thing.  And I 
would very often...I mean, I did play outside in 
the street, too.  But I 
did a Hell of a lot of 
homework.  And in retrospect, I think I did a 
lot more homework than was ever assigned. 
Uh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids 
were different.  They were not interested. 
And I, at some very early age, decided I 
was going to be a scientist and I was going to do 
this and that and the other thing.  And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations.  And uh 

I suppose part of that was enhanced, in th
at, you know, I mean my mother just kind of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
33
 
 
expected that we would do things and she knew 
that they were not going to do things.  And 
uh...and I think she did not let that pass quie
tly by.  Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I 
played and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not a
llowed to do anything dangerous.  And that 
included uh...  My mother used to have a fit.  
I mean, in those days people thought that if you 
walked up and down the stairs--and we lived 
on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a 
heart attack.  So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time 
I had to walk up and down the stairs.  Uh, I was 
not allowed to uh ride a bicycle, uh when the 
other kids were learning to ride bicycles; a
nd I think...I think partly that was a financial 
ma tter.  You know, I mean, it took a 
quarter an hour to rent a bicycle.  Uh, but I think mostly 
it was a safety matter.  But one of the things 
that happened very early on is that uh...I mean, I 
had this brother who was almost eight years ol
der, who was a very...we were very close; and 

I had my mother, who was a very worrisome  
Jewish mother.  And I think very early on, 
there were many times when my mother woul
d say "Black," and my brother would say, 
"White."  And at a very early age, I think I 
discerned that my brother's responses came from 
the head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut.  And that, obviously, from 

the head was better.  And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to ma ke a 

decision between the two opinions, I almost invari
ably did what my brother said.  Uh, and he 
was very protective of me; and we had a very 
sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in 
retrospect.  But it was a very uh uh loving, a
nd very uh you know sort of...we were always, 
you know, sort of kissing and that
 kind of thing.  And, by and large, people did not yell, 
and...and so on.  But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the kitchen, 

because I...he had his own room but I studied in
 the kitchen, uh he would be right there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
34
 
 
"What are you saying to this child? "   And uh I 
reme mber funny things, like uh if I had a cold 
uh my mother would say, "Well, ma ybe you shoul
d stay home from school and stay in bed." 
And my brother said, "You take two handkerc
hiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're 
using the other one.  And go to school."  We
ll, I mean, I went to school with the two 
handkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess,
 I probably spent or tried to spend and 
probably did spend a certain amount of time with
 my brother's friends, who were much older 
than me.  I mean, they were adults and I was 
still a kid.  And I think they were trying to get 
rid of me a certain amount of the time.  I m
ean, they did...my brother took me to my first 
museum.  And one of his friends took me  to my
 first ballet, and so on.  Uh, and I remember 
once my mother getting involved, because my brot
her didn't want to take me someplace he 
was going with a friend.  And my mother - I rememb
er this is so ridiculous - my mother said, 
"You can't  go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't ." 
(Laughter)  Uh, so it was not a typical childhood, in that sense.   
 

Q: OK.  Thank you very much.  You seem to have pulled a lot of it together.  I think before we 
break, though, what I'd like to ask you...  First of 
all, is there anything that you want to add 
that you haven't already covered?  
 

A: Well, uh, yeah.  I think maybe I'd like to men
tion that I talk about this very easily now, but 
that all the times when my mother was still aliv
e and that she wanted to talk about some of 
these things, I really didn't want to hear about 
it.  I didn't want to lis
ten.  Uh, first of all, 
because she would get very emotional, and I...  And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
35
 
 
that.  Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my 
kids responding in the same way.  I mean, that 
[they] don't really need this.  Uh, and so I 
really went through very many years, essentia
lly, not thinking very much about this and 
making believe it never happened.  And when th
e other kids or other people would ask me, 
"Well, what effect do you think your backgr
ound had on you? "  I would say, "Well, I was 
too young and I don't reme mber anything, and I don'
t think it had any effect on me ."  And I 
think uh--and I've been trying to write about 
some of these issues--I think that there's a 
certain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and 

you're sort of building your life and it's very
 easy to sort of not look back and push 
everything aside.  And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think 

for other people also, some how the back...b
ackground come s back to haunt you.  And it 
wasn't  really until after our kids were 
born, and...and uh you know ma ybe when I was about 
35, that I started noticing that I...that certain thi
ngs I did were not really logically explainable 
by...by things that were happening then.  And that
 the only logical explanation of why I was 
doing certain things in that way, or doing them 
at all, had to do probably with some  of the 
things that had happened very early in 
life in Vienna.  And you know, my father 

disappearing and uh...and things that happened 
in... in France and uh...and in that school in 
Limoges, and uh... and that whole business of so
rt always being on the run for those years, 
and being scared, and uh...  And I think there is 
a lot of interesting material uh to explore 
there.  Uh, and uh...and to explore with other pe
ople who have had similar experiences.  Uh, 
I think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, I mean, I would always like to have a 

controlled experiment, and of course there is
 no controlled experiment--but trying to pick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
36
 
 
apart.  Uh, and of course it's only conjectur
al, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but 
some how trying to define for myself, you know, wh
at things that have stayed with me are 
really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in 

France, and so on.  And what things are 
just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents 
by and large are crazy anyway.  Right?   A
nd...and so you, your parents uh some how inflict 
on you uh some  of that craziness that they have.  
Uh, and it's hard to tell,
 because of course I 
don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started.  And it's only in 

recent years, and actually since she's died, that
 I've really thought enough about this to to 
realize that, you know, she mi ght have been 
and probably was a very sort of, you know, 
happy carefree person in ma ny ways uh but I ne
ver knew her.  I me an, my mother wore 

black for years and years and years; and then
 she finally switched to navy.  And it was, you 
know, it was only very very late, when I was alr
eady essentially an adult that she would ever 
wear anything that was red, 
or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she 
kept up on [my] father's  grave.  She alwa
ys you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle.  Uh uh she 
she always uh...you know, I mean, she always I 
think in...in many ways--in her thoughts, at 
least--she always lived in her past.  Not
...not in her actions, but you know...  "If I only had 
my sister to talk to," and so on.  And then 
one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh 
because I...I do remember this and it was very 
dramatic was right after the war was over. 
There was a blue letter that arrived from...I th
ink it was from a cousin of my mother's who 
ended up in Israel--and I don't know if he's still 
alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had 
happened to ma ny of our relatives.  And I mean, that, you know, I reme mber it as being 

horrendous; but now, when I think back, that mu
st have been just such an incredible 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
37
 
 
nightmare to my mother.  Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean, 
essentially everybody was killed, and...and some  of 
them in rather grotesque ways.  Uh and 
I...I guess I wish I could have been a little b
it more understanding of me in relation to my 
background, and I think that would have lead
 to...to my having a better understanding and 
appreciation of my mother uh during those years.  Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got 

along very well uh until the other girls started 
dating.  And then she got...  END OF TAPE 
...like our live-in baby sitters.  And I had my ve
ry strong, very very democratic ideas about 
uh...you know, the way those people should be done, 
should be treated.  And I...and I think 
in some  sense there was kind of...I guess, she verb
alized it often.  She felt that we treated our 
live-in baby sitters better than we treated her.
  And that was probably true, because they 
didn't sort of interfere in our 
lives.  And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when 
she should have become  a friend.  And I think...I
 mean, in retrospect now that was because 
she was very lonesome.  So there's a lot more
, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it 
sometime.   
 

Q: OK.  I hope you do.  Uh, thank you.   

 

A: Is there anything else you wanted to...?  

 

Q: As a postscript, yeah.  We'll get to phot
os in a mi nute, but because you lived in the 
Klinghoffers...lived with the Klinghoffers for a 
while and there has been a great interest 
lately in Leon Klinghoffer, after the Achille
 Lauro incident, do you 
remember Leon?  Can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
38
 
 
you describe him as a child?  
 
A: Uh, I remember...I remember all five children 
uh very well.  Uh, I gue
ss I sort of uh really 
liked at first the youngest daughter best, becau
se she was so pretty and dynami c and she 
dressed so nicely.  And I was a little girl, 
and uh...and I guess, I didn't take very much 
interest in the two boys.  I think partly b
ecause they were involved in, you know, they ran 
this hardware store and they were busy; but I think also they seemed a 
little gruff to me.  Uh, 
the girls, all - actually it's funny - the girls 
were all very well-spoken even, though the boys 
come in the mi ddle.  But the boys have mu
ch more of a vernacular New York way of 
speaking, and uh...  But anyway, they...they we
re - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they 
were not so interesting to me when I was a little
 girl.  And I did occasionally go to the store 
and so on.  But the thing that I remember just
 incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere 
along the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this 

absolutely horrible teacher.  I mean, it was a 
dollar an hour.  And I don't know whether that 
was a lot in those days - I think it was not even 
a lot in those days.  But she was...she was not 
a very good teacher.  Uh but anyway.  And 
I only took lessons for maybe a year or 

some thing, but some how in the course of th
at year--or maybe it was a little longer--there 
were two recitals where I played, you know, a di
ddley something-- "In My Country Garden," 
or some thing-- for you know thirty seconds.  At one of these recitals uh... and you have to 

understand that in those days I could never have
 anything that any of the other kids had, and 

I rationalized it very well.  I always said I di
dn't want any of the other things.  But uh at 
Easter time, you know, the other kids would get 
new suits, and I...I usually didn't, and so on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
39
 
 
Leon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley
 piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet 
of pink peonies, you know; which are these really 
hugh full flowers.  And I...I just will never 
forget that. I mean, that was...that made quite
 an impression.  And just a few months ago, I 
was thumbing through one of my mother's ol
d photo albums and on one of the last pages 
this, there was this bunch of flower petals, and 
in one corner one of these flower petals - you 
know, they were all brown, there was still a little
 bit of pink and I suddenly realized that 
those were probably the left-over of the pink 
peonies uh so that was one thing.  Then I 
reme mber Leon Klinghoffer went into the army
 and I remember hearing that he uh I don't 
know whether - but anyway some thing happene
d and I guess he was in Europe and he 
became hard of hearing in one ear uh and then 
he came back and he met this very attractive 
doll-like woma n who he ma rried, Marilyn Klinghoffe
r.  Uh and I remember sort of thinking, 
because he was not really very attractive phys
ically, and uh I think he already then maybe 
had a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me , and here, you know, 
he ma rried this incredibly uh pretty uh woma n uh and they went on to have kids.  And my 

mother kind of kept contact and went to th
e wedding and I don't remember where I was at 
the time, but I I didn't go and I didn't s
ee Leon Klinghoffer for a long time.  I did 
occasionally, like in college I needed somethi
ng and I went to his store to buy it and uh but 
about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one
 of the other members of the family had a 
bar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came.  And 
by that time, he had already had a stroke. 
Uh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even 

then--he pulled me  over.  And his speech was qu
ite slurred, because of the stroke, at that 
time; and we just talked for a little while.  
And he said, "You know, I 
want you to know that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 
40
 
 
your mother was really a very good woma n."  
Uh, and I...I remember being incredibly 
impressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn. 
 And she was still so attractive-looking; and 
thinking, you know, "What a fantastic lady this 
is!  I mean, she takes care of him, she 
works..."  And you know, and she had told me  all 
these stories about the some of the things 
she did for her kids.  And I...I really felt this 
incredible feeling of respect for her; and I took 
her business card, because she was working I th
ink for a publishing company at the time, and 
I put it on my bulletin board.  And I said, "Y
ou know, I really think I ought to get to know 
Marilyn better."  But then, of course, you know
, she was in New York and I was in New 
England.  And uh I guess I talked to her ma ybe
 once or twice more at another family 
function.  And then there was this morning in Oc
tober of '85.  I was sitting at breakfast next 

to my husband, and he had the newspaper open.  
And I was reading some thing else.  And I, 
out of the corner of my eye, I saw this picture.  And the thought went through my mi nd, 

"Gee, that lady looks just like Marilyn Klingho
ffer."  And just seconds later, my husband 
said, "Isn't  your cousin's name  Klinghoffer? "  And I said, "Yes."  And he showed me  this 

article uh about the highjacking of the Achille 
Lauro.  And I...I couldn't believe it.  And I 
think it was either later that same day or the 
next morning, we turned on the television and he 
had been shot.  And I...I mean, I was just tota
lly incredulous.  Uh, well, I think would have 
been incredulous if it had been anybody that I 
knew on that ship, anyway.  But some how for 
it to be this person who was part of the famil
y, that helped get us over here; and it was now, 
you know, forty-five years later.  Uh, I mea
n, I...and you know, I kept...I kept thinking to 
myself, you know, "Statistically, what are the chan
ces that these two events should be in the 
same  person's life? "  And I...it wa
s...  Anyway, I went down to that funeral.  And that whole

family is very...they are very closed-mouthe
d about when things go wrong.  I mean, in 
contrast to the people that I hang around w
ith, who...who are very...you know, they sort of 
talk about this one's got this and this one ju
st had an operation and so on.  And so, when I 
was going down to the funeral, some body--it wa
s Dorothy, I think--said to me, "Well, you 
know, I think Marilyn's been ill."  And becau
se I have this morbid streak, I mean, 
immediately the worst thing crossed my 
mi nd.  But I...you know, nobody had said anything. 
And so...  But then after the 
funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's house; and she just looked 
like living Hell.  And I, as I was leaving to
 go back on the train, I...I kissed her good-bye. 
And I ...and I said, you know, "Well, ma ybe you'd lik
e to come up and visit us, or something. 
And I'll see you again."  And she sort of
 looked at me ; and she said, you know, "OK, 
darling.  And uh...and I...I thought, "Something is
 wrong with this woma n."  And a mi nute 
later, I said, you know, "Don't be silly!"  
I mean, you know, how w
ould you look if you had 
just been through this whole thing, and...and your
 husband had been shot, and so on?   And 
uh...and then nobody said anything.  And then I reme mber, in...I guess it was in December, 
we wake up to the news; and the mi nute the ne
ws went on, the first thing was that Marilyn 
Klinghoffer had died of cancer. 
 And, you know, it was just...well, I...I never knew her that 
well.  And I just...you know, I just felt very sa
d, because I somehow thought that I'd like to 
get to know her better and I never did.  And all those other good things.  But, so uh...that's 

the connection. 
 

Q: OK.  Thank you.

DOCUMENTS & PHOTOGRAPHS
 
 
(1)
 Uh this is my mother and my father and I think this was probably uh shortly after they had 
gotten either engaged or married, which I th
ink must have been about 1925.  They got 
engaged in '25; so this is from that general period.  My brother was born in '27. 
 

(2)
 This is a picture that was taken shortly after 
my father's death.  And uh uh that's me  cheek-to-
cheek with my mother, and uh that's my br
other on the other side.  And uh I don't know. 
Somehow, to me this picture says it all.  It
's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief-
stricken.  And especially--I didn't mention this 
before, but--my brother.  Who, of course, was 
much older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along 
very well with my mother.  But he really 
liked my father very much.  And I think he 
was incredibly devastated.  And I think during 
those times when my father was so uh depressed, 
I know he told me that that my mother just 
couldn't take it anymore and she would go off a
nd do other things.  And he would stand in a 
dark room, just holding my father's hand.  And I think...I think he was just totally, you know, 
knocked for a loop that his favorite parent was ta
ken away from him that way.  And I think it 
really shows in his face.  And 
I think uh...I think you can see in my mother's face that she is 
just totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have
 a feeling that I probably didn't really 
understand too much about what was going on.  Bu
t I think I must have reflected all the 
feelings that were happening around me .

 Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the su
rvivors of the St. Loui
s uh in Miami.  And uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186

one evening, there was a dinner and a lot of 
people brought various artifacts.  And this uh 
woma n by the name  of Mr....  Actually, a c
ouple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album; 
and I was sort of thumbing through it, and I f
ound these two photographs with me  in it.  And 
this one not only had me--and here I am, right he
re--uh but this one also had a picture of my 
brother looking absolutely mi serable.  And 
my first thought was that he look mi serable 
because he was forced to wear a double-breasted
 suit with short pants.  But uh I think he 
looked mi serable because he just really knew 
what was going on; and 
I think he was very 
serious and unhappy on the trip.  But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and 
this is actually the woman with whom I room
ed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit 
about fifteen years ago.  She lives near Philadelphia.  Uh, so that was a great find.

 This is a photograph of one page of our pass
port, which we have in a very well-preserved 
condition.  It's the usual passport, with the 
swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it 
has a lot of information.  It tells that we
 left from Hamburgha
fen on May 13th, 1939.  And 
then it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish mi ddle 
name s--uh, Sarah for me --appended.  And on this 
page, it says in French: "Refugees of the 
S.S. St. Louis.  Reif, Chaje"--which is my 
mother's Jewish name--"et ses deux enfants, uh 
Friedrich et Liane"--"and her two children, Frederick and Liane."  Uh, and of course there 

are ma ny such passports.  But for me , uh some
how especially because I didn't think about 
this for such a long time, every once in a wh
ile when this whole episode comes into my 
mi nd, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't  possi
bly really have happened to me.  This is 

some  movie I saw, or some  dream.  TEC
HNICAL CONVERSATION.  And then I go and

fish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real. 
 
Q: Alright.  Liane, thank you.
