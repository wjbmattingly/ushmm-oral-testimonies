>> Bill Benson:  Harry,  thank you som uchfor your willingness to bewith us today and be our First 
Person.
 
W ehave justan hourand youhave som uch to share with us. W e'll jum p right inand getstarted.  

Your father settled in Berlin in 1919.  Hem arried your mother in 1926.  By the time you were born in 

1937, Hitler and the Nazis had been in power forf our years. Let'sbegin with your telling us about 

your parentsand their lives prior to your birthand certainly prior to the startof  the war.
 
>> H a r r
y Marko wic z:  T his ishearsay.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hearsay, absolutely.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My f ather was in thefur business.  I think it was afamily tradition, because his 

brothers were also in thefur business,and my m other was ahousewif e.  My two siblings were born 

bef ore I was. T ook care of them . T hey probably had them iddle class lif e, as far asI know.  They 

hadam aid, which was  im portant, because ofthepolicem an.  It was actually thef iancé of the maid.
 
My parents were religi ous butnotthat religious asfar as I can tell.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Harry,  your father was a soldier in thef irst world wa r, right?
 

>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  He was drafted when he was 15 years old.  Ihave no idea what
 
he did because 
he never talkedabout it, but Arlene,m y wif e,askedhim once what he did, and he didn't say what he 

did, buthe said it was horrible.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And was the part where he was 
--
 
where he was born was actually in Poland, but 
Russia at
 
th at time ?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  You've got m e there.  I know m y m other used to try to tell m e the history of the 

fam ily and so on. One tim e it was Russia and then Poland. It changed.  But I'm not 
--

>> Bill Benson:  But you know hefought in the 
F i rs t  W
or l d  W ar
? 
>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was your extendedf am ily?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My m other'sf am ily wa s quite large. T en siblings.  My f ather, Ithinkthere were 

six in all, three boys and three girls.  Actually, four survived.  T hefour that left Poland bef ore the war 

survi ved.  One in Venezuela andone inTangier and one he joined the Frenchforeign agent and sent 

to North Af rica.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your father came to Berlin in 1919.  Do you know wh y he movedto Berlin?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes, therehad been skirm ishes 
--
 
not skirm ishes 
--
 
the Poles and Russia were 
starting tof ighteach other, and so he was going to be drafted againanddidn't want to gof ight again, 

so he lef t.  Subsequently there was a Polish
-
Ru s s ia n
 
war that started in 1920 and lasted until 1921.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you have any sensef rom what you learned later orf rom your parentswhat Berlin 

was like f or them  inthe 1920s? Because that's where they m ade their life.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  It was not
 
a goodtim e in Germ any.  Germ any had lost the war. T here was an 
econom ic crisis, inf lation,unem ploym ent.  But som ehow it was still better than living in Polandat the 

t im e .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hitler,of course, came to power in 1933. Did your parents ever share with you much 

about what that was like ashe gathered his power and then really wasf ully in charge of Germ any?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  No, they never 
--
 
we never talked about that period.W e never talked about the 
war period either.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
You did tellm e that yourfather was one of those who thought that Nazism couldn't 
last, that it wouldend and you would get through this.  Isthat so?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  Som epeople left early.  Especially professionals, because starting af ter 

Hi
tler cam e topower, soon after, doctors, lawyers, couldn'tpractice,civi l servants could not teach us,

university prof essors were f iredf rom their jobs, som any imm igrated.  But myf ather's business was 
wholesale.  Hehad representationonthe street, a store that was boycotted.  Sofor him he was not 

aff ected econom ically.
 
Inf act, som e of his com petition lef tand em igrated. Business gotbetter forhim .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnachtor the Night of Broken Glass took place on November 9
-
10, 1938, the 
ye a
r af ter you were born.  On that night there were pogrom s against Jews, hundreds of synagogues 
burned, thousands of businesses destroyed, thousandsof  Jewish men rounded upand sent to 

concentration cam psand prisons. Som etim earound Kristallnacht yourf am
ily f le d  B e rlin  f o r B e lgiu m  
and just prior to that yourf ather had taken your two siblings with him  to Aachen, Germ any, but he 

cam e back. T ellus what you can about the events that ledto yourfather taking your brother and 

sister to Aachen andthen com ing back and then youf leeingf or Belgium .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  After being warned by hisf riend, the policeman 
--
 

>> Bill Benson:  As you said, the policemanwas thef iancé of your m aid, right?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  So no longer them aid, becauseaf ter 1935,
 
Jews were not allowed to have 
young Germ an wom en working for them . But we m adef riends, apparently.
 
One thing, we never talked about any of this,but whenm y niece was in high school, she had to 

intervie w a grandparent, and Ihappened tobe theref orthe
 
interview, m y parents were both there, 
butm y niece interviewed m y m other. And occasionally m y father would say som ething.  So that was 

theonly tim e I heard the story of  their lives and som eof  the things that I learned about thepoliceman.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  From the conversation they had with your niece who was intervie wing f or aschool 
project?
 

>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   R i gh t .   I' m  so rry
 
...
 
>> Bill Benson:  So yourfather lef tf or Aachen, Germ any, with your siblings.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Aachen is on theborder, Belgium , Holland.  And tookm y sister wit h him with

RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
the ideathat we were going to go 
--
 
I don't know which country they were going to go to.  Sm uggled 
across the border. By that tim e it was too late to go, so the sm uggler had takenon toom any pe
ople.  
T here were m any people that wanted to getoutand m y brother 
--
 
m y brother toldm e this.  I don't 
rem em ber.  I wasn't there.  T here were probably 40 people going through the woods, very noisy, and 

they got the attention of a Dutch patrol andthey were arrestedand turned over to the Germ an 

authorities.  My father was jailed.  All the adults were jailed.  My brother and sister were placed with a 

Jewish f am ily in Aachen.
 
Andabout three weeks later, thepolice calledm y m other inBerlin and asked,do you know where 

your husband is?  Andshe said, of course, he's in Aachen on vacation. Aachen isa spa, resort town.  

People go therefor vacations.  So thism atched whatm y f atherhadtold them, so they believe them .  

Andhe came back with m y brother and sister to Berlin. T hen he went by him self  and got into 

Belgium ,andthen hearrangedf orthe rest of us,m y m other, brother and sister, to com eacross with 

a Belgianm an who lived near theborderand worked in Germany and he drove us back to Belgium . 

It w
as fortunatethat it just happened that Hitler was gi vin g a speech on the radioat the time we were 
at the border, so the German guards were listening tothe speech.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you more or less slippedover?
 

>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  Is that thetim e where therewas an incident of almost losing the keys tothe vehicle?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  A manowned the garage, so he hada lotof  car keys together, and he 

hadto go inside to the Germ an custom s people, and because they wou
ldn't come out.  T hey wanted 

to hear the speech. So while he was gone, to occupy m e,he gavem ethe keys, and when it was 

tim e to go, the gate was open. They were waiting f orhim to start the car and go andhe's looking for 

which key it was to go out.
 
Ev
er ybody got a little anxious at thatpoint.

RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
>> Bill Benson:  But they m ade it.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hey m ade it.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your father trying to goacross the border andbeing apprehended,and you 
f inally did get across, had hem ade effortsto
 
try to im m igrate, I think he appliedf ora visa to the U.S.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  He did, likemany other people,but they weren't giving visas.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that was a dead
-
end to pursue that? Do you know if  they tried any other eff orts to 
leave the country?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I don't know of any others.  Especially since m y f ather thought thatHitler was 

not going to stay in power m uch longer, that the world would puta stop to it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your brother and sister are several years older
 
than you, eight or nine years older 
than you, soby thattim e, they were well into their school years.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappened to their schooling?  Germany before you lef t, do you know?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hey were going
 
to regular public school and thenat some point they were no 
longer allowed to go to school, so they went to Jewish schools withall theother Jewish kids.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you f inally do getacross the border, you're in Antwerp, Belgium . W hatdid you
r 

father dotom ake ends m eet and get you establishedonce you were across the border, saf ely f or the 

m om ent in Belgium ?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Fortunately Belgium  allowed illegal im m igrants to live there. T herewere quite a 

few who had com ef rom  Germ any, Austria and Poland. Butthey were not allowed to work.  So m y 

father was invol ved in exchange of  currency.  The currency was the dollar and the British pound, 

black market kind of thing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So black m arket work to make endsm eet. And I think
 
you mentioned at one point 
you thought they were also dealing in som ediam ondsand whatever it tooktobeabletofeed the

RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y

f a m ily,  e s s e nt ia lly.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Antwerp is attheW orld Centerf ordiam ond cutting, andat that time it 
wa s, I th i
nk,alm ost exclusivel y Je ws invol ve d in thatbusiness.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So there you are now li ving in  Belgium , yourfather is trying to m akea lif etheref or 

thefam ily, but in May 1940, of course, Germany invades Belgium on May 10th, 1940.  Afew days 

la
ter yourf am ily f leestowards France, you'reheadedto France.T ell us about thef am ily's decision, if  
you can,about leaving Belgium ,trying to get to France and what that effort was like.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My f am ily was not theonly one. Hundredsof
 
thousands of Belgians, Jews and 
not Jews, wanted to get out of Belgium .  Belgium declared itself neutral, just like ithad been in world 

war one.  Num berone, the Germansdidn't respect that. T hey cam e throughBelgium  to get to 

France.  The Second W orld 
W ar
 
was the sam ething. T he Frenchhadbuilt up very strong 
fortif ication, them arginal lines on the borderwith Germ any.  So Germ ans chose not to go the hard 

wa y.  T hey cam ethrough Belgium . And so thousands andthousands of  people trying to go into 

F ra
nce, thinking that the French and the British, because bef ore theattack started on Belgi um , 
Luxem bourg, several thousand soldiers stationed in France at the border to help the French.
 
T he Germ ans invadedBelgium. TheBritish sent troops intoBelgium itse
lf .
  
So there were hundreds 
of  
--
 
m aybeasm any as a m illion Belgians going to France.  My parents anda relative and three other 
fam ilies,they went to the trucktodrive us to the French border.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Letme stop youf ora second before you tell usm ore about that.  From  what you tell 

m e, m y im age is whatwe see in war m ovies, literally hundredsof  thousands, if not am illion people, 

on bicycles and cartsand carsand trucks,all f leeing Pell Mel, trying to get away, is that what your 

sense of  
that was like?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I don't remem ber that specif ically, but that's what it was.  Not toom any cars.  

T here was a shortageof  gas.

>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  And whathappened, we got to the Belgian coast.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rented a truck with a driver?  So he's driving you?
 
>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Okay.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  And then he ref usedto go any further, whatever his reason was.  Maybe he 
was concerned abouthaving f uelto getback.  But also
 
it was ver y hard to drive becausethe roads 
were covered with people walking and soon,bicycles, so hedropped usoffat the side of the road.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So basically that's it.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hat's it. And we had to walk.  At som e pointm y
 
f atherand the other fam ily 
that was related to us, they bought 
--
 
I don't know what they call it. On the beach they have these 
threeorf our wheel bicycle kind of  things with  a bench, you pedal,for tourists. So they bought one of  

those things andputall thebaggage on top. The otherfam ily had three, alm ost three, andthe other 

fam ily also hada little girl who was three,almost three. They put us on top,and som e were pushing 

and some of thefam ily were pulling. W e got to the border, there were many people there. And the 

French let in Belgians,Dutch,other people.  But we didn'thave any nationality.  W e were stateless, 

so they didn't let us in.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So why were you stateless?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Personally, I was stateless because I
 
was born in Germ any af ter thetim e that 
Je ws 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Lost your citizenship?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  Butm y parentswere never Germ ans. I guess they were Polish.  But the 

conditions they left in 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyessentially had no citizenship anywhere in the eyes of the French there?
 

12 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  My sister told me that m y mother was trying to convince a Polish 
speaking French custom  guy to letus in,but it didn't work.  So we retreatedf rom  theborder to see 

what was going to happen.  And there were a 
--
 
ever ybody was there on vacation, so they went to a 
vil la and we were sitting there.  Didn't have any m oney, sothey sub
-
rented parts of  the house to other 
people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Probably on the sam eboat trying to get
 
across the border?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hey were going to try to do another attem pt later afew m onthsf rom the 

border.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou toldm eeventually there were 50 people living in the house thatyou had 

takenf or thatperiod of time.  So there's no hopeof  you getting intoFrance. So whatdid you do 

then?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  W ell, at that tim eBelgium had surrendered, so the Germans were there. T he 

Germ ans had surrounded the British Expeditionary Forces, severalhundred thousand British soldiers, 

and French soldiers, put their backto theocean right where we wer e, on the other side of the border, 

both sidesof  theborder really.  T heharbor, Dunkirk, the other side is the French side,theborder,and 

the British were beingevacuated,
 
all of them , the French were being evacuated,andthe British Navy 
ships, but theharbor had been bombed.  Forsom e reason the Germans had stopped about 25m iles 

back.  Maybethey ranoutof  supplies.  But they were still bombing the soldiers on the beach
es, and 

we were there on this.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, while you were on the road, you were strafed by Germ an planes,as I recall 

you saying.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I don't remem ber that. T he very f irst m em ory in m y life was being ina ditch 

next to the r
oad.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfirst mem ory in life, is that right?
 

13 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I rem em ber that therewas next to m e on theroad, there was a soldier.  But I 
knew som ehow he was an officer.  He was looking at the sky through binoculars. I was in the 
ditch 

by m yself  with m y m other next to me andm any other people.  Somehow this British 
--
 
I don 't kn o w if it 
wa s  B rit is h  
--
 
this off icer was comf orting,and I went to sleep.  I woke up.  Andhe wasn't there 
anym ore,I askedm y m other where the soldier was,
 
because Ithought there was justone.  And she 
toldm e,they're gone.  And I realized 
--
 
not realized 
--
 
I felt her f ear and anxiety about the soldiers, 
thatthe Germ ans would arrive.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, they didarrive and m arched into Franceand
 
the village you wer e in were 
occupied by the Germans and youm adethedecisionto return back into Belgium. Tell uswhere you 

went.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  W e wentbackhom e to Antwerp, walking back.  But on the way, Germ an trucks, 

em pty trucks were com ing backf rom thef ront, pickedus up. T here were other refugeeswho didn't 

get into France. Theproblem, they were doing it to clear the roads, so they could com e back with 

trucks again.  My m other said they fedus. W e didn't have any foodand they gave us
 
bread toeat.  
T he stores were notopen,nothing was working.  So we went back to Antwerp that way.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onceyou were back in Antwerp with the Nazis in control, they started passing all 

kind of edicts and harsh laws. W hat were som eof  thethings that they did?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  It was ver y progressi ve,  stepby step.T hey didn't do itall atonce.  You got 

usedtoone restriction andaccepted it and then they introducedanother one. One thing, the Jews 

hadto register. They had to register Ithinkwith the policebut also with the Germ ans, but the Jewish 

Co u n c il.
 
T here was one small step.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eventually f orced

>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint Jewish m enwere pressed intof orced labor, including your father, 
r i gh t ?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  At f irst inBelgium ,there were ghettos in Belgium .
 
Each country was really diff erent. Theattitude of the Germ ans towards eastern Europeans was ver y 

d iffe re nt f rom  
W e s te r n
 
Europe
,  
Be l g
ium  and France. Theattitude towards eastern Europeans, they 
didn't care about public opinion. They were going to m ake Poles in Russians.  Half  of thecountry is 

Flem ish speaking, Dutch, but thatm eanstheGerm anic people, they eventually include.  But t
h e y 
were concerned aboutpublic opinion.  People behaved correctly, politely.  T hey didn't do anything in 

public that wouldbring public opinion.  As it was, BelgianshatedtheGermans anyway, as a result of 

W or ld  W ar
 
1.  A lot ofbattles took place inBelgium  duringW orldW ar I, and so there wasno lost love 
between the Belgians for the Germans.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So there you are living underthese progressivel y harsher and harsher edicts and 

rules and laws.  Yourfamily m akes a decision tom ovef rom Antwerp and your move to Brussels, and 

you were there, Ithink, for about 18 months when yourfam ily m akes the very profound decision that 

it's tim eto go intohiding.  T ell us what caused them , your parents, to make thatdecision and then 

what happened.
 
>> H a r r
y Marko wic z:  T he Germ ans, they lef t the Jews aloneexcept all the restrictions, but they took 
m en, young able
-
bodied men to work inf actories and soon.  Alsotobuild thefortif ications in northern 
France on the coast, as they expected the British to cou
nter
-
attack, invade.  Andatf irstthe m en who 
were taken would write postcards home andever ything was f ine andthey would come back.  But 

later on they didn't com ebackand the cards were 
--
 
it was part of the deceptionthat was typical of 
Germ ans.  To m
ake things easy for them thatwa y.
 
Som y f ather was called up to goto work andhe didn't want to go. So we left Antwerp.  Infact, it was 

a union route, the selection of them en who were going to work.  So in Brussels, m y parents didn't 

15 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
register.  And so
 
that was 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Can you describe tom eduring thattim e you were livin g in Brussels, where you 
father hadn't registered, at that point you weren't inhiding, but I think the word you used, you were 

" living anonym ously"  because he wasn't registered. So you weren't really known to theauthorities 

there.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Oneday I was home with m y m otherandbrother and sisterwere in 

schoolandm yf atherwas doing his business.  A Gestapooff icer,two soldiers cam e toour apartm ent 

andI'm not sure why they cam e.  Probably to lookfor valuablesand m oney.  Inthef ront room of  the 

apartm ent with m y m other, and theoff icer, and two others, the soldiers were som ewhere else in the 

apartm ent. And the doorbell rang, and I ranto the window to see who was there.  All of asudden this 

off icer yelled at me.  I didn'tunderstand what he said. ButI stopped to run and he threw som ething at 

m e.  Maybe anapkin, I don't know what it was.  But I was scared becausehe was yelling at me.  And 

I  st
arted crying and then he said, the Germ anoff icer gives an order,you have toobey.
 
At thatpointI looked up in theeyes and said, is that really enough?
 
T he off icer of theT hird Reich, to behave with a child, if thishappened in Poland, he wouldhave sho
t 

her.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But in this case he lef t, right?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hey lef t shortly af terwards.  It was quiet.  Hetold me to leave the room , which I 

didn'tdobecauseI was hanging out and scared. Possibly the whole fam ily, I don't know. But
 
he was 
aware what he was doing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, in 1942, the Germans began rounding up Jews in Brussels and in 

Belgium  and that's when your parentsdecided it was tim etono longer live anonym ously but go into 

hiding.  How did they go about going into hiding?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  As I said, it was in thesumm er of '42 that theJews are rounding upwhole 

16

fam ilies,everybody, not just young able
-
bodied men who could work, all people,babies, sick people, 
anyone who is Jewish.  And taking them  away in areas that were predom inantly Jewish.  Like I said, 
there were no ghettos. Nam es and addresses.  And Antwerp, that's where it started. T hey had a 

couple raids. Antwerp, the police worked to collaborate with the Germ ans.  T hey helped collect 

people 
in  B ru sse ls.
 
Af term y parentsf ound outaboutthe raids inAntwerp, we stopped sleeping in our apartment. There 

were Jews l i ving in the neighborhood.  So we had abrother who live d nearby in the Jewish area.  

Some of us stayed with the brotherandhisfam ily and some of us stayed with f riends, I think.  And 

then afew days later the Jews had a raiding process. They took everybody awa y who wa s there.  At 

thatpoint, I wenttohiding.  T hef irstplace where we went was with a couple,and m y parents asked 

an
dpaidthem tom ove to another neighborhood inBrussels. Sothat people wouldn't know.  And 

they tookus with them .  It didn't work out toowell because they locked us into the apartment, which is 

not the worst thing,but there was nof ood. W hich didn't bother me. But things got worse. W emoved 

back into the Jewish neighborhood where we lived previously, so there were empty apartm ents. So 

they m ovedback. And the f inal thing was thegrandson,18
-
year
-
oldgrandson was living with them, 
andhe was and 1
8 -
year
-
old and unem ployed.  He joinedafascist Belgian group and eventually 
joined the German army along with 25,000 
--
 
approxim ately 25,000otherBelgian young men.  Most 
of  them were killed on the f rontf ighting the Russians.
 
So hem ay nothave turned in his grandparentsfor hiding Jewish kids, but we weren't going to takea 

chance, so we didn't stay.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Is that when you thenm oved to theVanderlindenfam ily?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T here was anotherplace where m y sister and I stayed.  It was
 
a children's 
home inthe country.  Maybe the children were there because they hadbeen sick and wewere 

convalescent, I'm  not sure.  Butm y m other cam eto visit.  My m other couldpassfor non

blond hair andblueeyes, although shedidn't speak French or Flem ish, which is a dead giveaway.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or Germ an.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes, not Frenchand Flem ish.  But she cam e to check on us,and she realized 
thatthe Jewish children in this hom e, not everybody was Jewish, but there were some Jewish adults, 

andthat made itm uchm ore interesting, so she took usaway.
 
And af ter that 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  By yourself, though?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  At f irstm y sister was there too,for a little period, to help. Because Iwas 

scared, I guess.
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  So now you are genuinely hiding in the Vanderlindens' hom e. W hat was that likefor 
you?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  It was entire hiding.  I went to school. Theneighbors must have known that I 

was not their son,but not necessarily that I was Jewish.  The school in the area, it was a Flem ish
-

speaking area,and itwas a Catholic school. Everybody spoke French. Someof thenuns spoke 

French. Buteverything was in French, the teaching. T he kidsonly spoke Flemish, but after a short 

tim e I metanolder boy who spoke Frenchand it turnedout tobea Jewish kid alsof rom  Brussels.  

And then he introduced me to som eother kids who spoke French.T here were abouta dozen in the 

school. And all of us were Jewish f rom Brussels.  Because in Brussels they speak French.  In 

Brussels itself . T his was in thefarm ing area.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right,it was sort of  isolated, rural, but at som epointI think your parents persuaded 

the Vanderlindens to actually m ove intoBrussels with you?
 

>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   Righ t .
 
>> 
Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My brother was also living in this area, although they toldm ethey did not 

18 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y

possibly gi ve awa y if  questioned.  And theGestapo went tothe house where he was saying. T here 
were t wo other Jewish kids there, the Gestapo intelligence lookingfor Jewish kids. T hey were 

lookingf or the son of 
--
 
s o rry --
 
son of thef amily.  He was workin g on the railroad andeither draf ted 
to work in Germany, or some of the Belgians took jobs working f or the Germans.  He was working in 

Germ any with several otherBelgians, andthey got f ive
-
day leave to go hom e.  But thetrains were 
running like they run norm ally.  It tookaf ew days to get to Brussels and then they went back and they 

were late.  Meanwhile, they had been where they were.  T hey worke d on a railroad yard.  And the 

railroad yard had been bom bed, so they suspected that nine orm ore of themhad given inform ation 

about theallies that led tothe raid. Sotheywere arrested. The Gestapo cam e tothe house to look 

f
or a radio transm itter, andm y brother saidthey were searching everywhere, pictures andso on.
 
But bef ore they left,my brother and the other two kids, in Germ an,we'll be backf or you tom orrow.  

So they didn't stick around.  My brother where they were li
vi n g  
--
 
m y brother knew where they were 
living.  He came over and left the area just incase the Germans cam ethenext day.  As itturns out, 

they didn't. T hey didn't come back. They wer e not interested.
 
So after thatm y parents asked tom ove into Brussels itself . Sotheyagreed. Then I was by m yself .  

And that was until the liberation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the Vanderlindenfam ily, they hada daughter.  Your mother was able to persuade 

them  and give them  the money tomove intoBrussels with you.  They were doing thisat considerable 

risk to them selves, wer en't they?
 

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Def initely, yes.  In Poland, I know that the Poles who helped Jews or hid Jews 

were executed on thespot, wholefam ilies.  If neighborshappenedto be there as well.  InB
e lgiu m ,  I 
don't know what would have happened, but itwas def initely 
--
 
they didn't know what would happen.  
T hey were taking a risk.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Harry,  I'm  m indful of our time and several things I know you want to talk about.  

19 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
W hen you were with the Vanderlindensnow in Brussels, tell us where your parents were at that tim e 
andalso I want you tobe sure to share with us that your m other somehow or another cam eto visit 

you a couple tim es.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My parents lived in what looked likea vacantapartment ina row house on a 

quiet street. T here was a neighbor acrossthe street that providedfoodfor them  whenf ood was 

available. T here wasn't ver y m uchfood. And m y sister and brotherwrote tomy parents regularl y to 

inform them  that they were f ine.  It was very i m portant. T here were no telephones. So the same 

neighbor would receive the mail athis address and thenhe would thenm ail my m other's letters back 

tom y brother and sister using his address, so they couldn't be traced to my parents' apartm ent.  My 

m other went out occasionally.  She came tom e.  One tim e I was playing on the street.  At this point I 

passedf or theVanderlindens' son.  Nobody knew.
 
Althougha priest cam e to
 -- 
Mrs. Vanderlinden ran a store.  He came into the store.  I wasoutside.  I 
saw him  going in.  And he came out. I didn't think toom uch of  it. W hen I went home, Mrs. 

Vanderlinden said, didyou see thepriest? I said, yeah.  And she said he knew I wasn't their son, that 

I  wa s Je wish .
 
>> Bill Benson:  But she continued to keep you in her hom e at that point?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  He told her that if anything happened to the parents, he would com eand 

get m eand take care of me, whatever words he used, I don't know.  And she said,no way.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So
 
your parents are living in hiding in what appears to theoutside comm unity as a 
vacant building. And your mother cam eouta few tim es. Infact, I think you saw her on thestreet one 

t im e .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  One time we were playing, kids were throwing
 
a ball backandf orth on the 
sidewalk, and this door is behindm eand behind, I see aperson approaching and it'sm y mother. I 

rem em ber things that I have beentold,not tospeakGerman, that Iwas Jewish, obviously,  that the

Vanderlindens were not m y parents. I hada com pletely new identity.  But nobody said what I should 
do if  I see m y mother on the street. So she'scom ing closerand closer and she passedand I touched 

her and we lookat each other.
 
During that tim e yourfatherdid not leave hisplace
, did he, m uch if  at all?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  He never lef t.T wo ye ars.
 
>> Bill Benson: T wo years hidden insidethat place.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson: W henBelgium  
--
 
towards the end of the war, in Belgium ,because you were liberated 
b ef
ore elsewhere, tellus about your m other com ing to get you.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  A few days bef ore Brussels was liberated, the adults were aware that it was not 

far away, m y m other showed upunexpectedly.  And she said she was taking mehom e tostay with 

h
er andm y father.  It was kindof a surprise,a shock to Mrs. Vanderlinden and I were ver y c lose.  
She said after liberation, I could come back and stay with theVanderlindens again.  On the wa y, 

we're on a streetcar. Ijust remember I was on a streetcar afew tim es andm y m other was ver y 
--
 
I 
knew she was scared. I wasn't scared because I was a littleboy.  Ididn't know what could happen.  

But you couldfeel the fear of the adults, sort of  like osm osis. This tim e she was a little more relaxed 

and at so
me point shesaid, look 
--
 
shepointed, and I looked andthere was a truck, a small truck 
Germ an truckpulled by a horse.  Itm ight have beenout of  gasor broke down, I didn't know.  And on 

topof  the truck lying down was a Germ an soldier with a heavy
-
dut
y m achine gun.  But hewas acting 
ver y strange. W estopped and they were m oving ver y slo wl y, so we  could see them . He kept looking 

around, like thetops of buildings, and I remem berm y m other said, they're running away.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But then she 
--
 a
s thealliedforces, the British came in.  Shetook youtoapark.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Af ter I had been with them  afew days, I understand that shewas taking 

m eto a parkthat was nearby, and 
--
 
but there were a lotof  peopleon the street,all going the same

direction. At some point we passed a tank that was onf ire.  It was burning.  I think it was probably a 
Germ an tank. Looking back at it,I didn't probably 
--
 
som ebody had thrown a Molotov cocktail on it.  I 
was f ascinated by thetank burnin
g.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're a littleboy, yeah.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  So I stopped and wanted to 
--
 
I was just looking.  And m y mother grabbedm e 
and said, let's go!
 
Andas we were getting closer to the park, there were m oreandm ore people rushing in that d
ire c t ion ,  

and we arrived and all were covered with tanks and British soldiers,andhappy people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described ittom e onceas " happy pandemonium ."
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  My m other walked over to the tank. T here was a soldier standing on top 

of  the tankand we didn't have a com mon language, but he reached down, bent over, andm y m other 

handedme up.  He held me andm y m other said, "
G
ive him a kiss." And kissing people, children 
kissing people ism ore practicedhere, but this is ver y special.  So I kissed him  on the cheek and then 

I looked down atm y m otherand she was cryi ng.  I didn't know wh y.  I don't know wh y she was cr ying.  

She tried to explain, it's okay, she's crying f or joy.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Harry,  of  course, the war is ongoing elsewhere in Europe.  You're liberated in 
Belgium ,andat somepoint your parents have you. T hen you goback to the Vanderlindens and your 

parents go to get your brotherand sisterf rom where they were hidden. And they hada very scar y 

experience. W ill you tell us about that?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes, m y brotherand sister by then were living separately with diff erentf am ilies 

in am ountainous area, hilly area in Belgium ,andthey have to go there by train.  My m other never 

visited there,because going on trains was particularly dangerous.  At the train stations, people

On the way, m y parents were talking to eachother.T hey were whis pering to eachother inGerm an 
and somebody heard them, and Germans were not in Belgium  at that time. I don't know the details of 

this, but there was other peopleangry.  Nothing happened.T he policem an cam e along and rescued 

m y parents.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere aboutto lynch them ,f rom what you know?
 
>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   P o s s ib ly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because they heard them  speaking German?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Germ an, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they got rescued. They were able to get your brother and sister. At what point 

was thef am ily really tr uly reunitedaf ter all that you hadbeen through? W hen did youall come 

together?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My brother and sister cam e toBrussels whenm y parents were gone.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they did notf ind them  when they got there?
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z
:  No.  Idon't know the details about that.W e got 
--
 
eventually we got 
--
 
oh, m y 
m other tookm ebackto the Vanderlindens bef ore they lef t. My uncle and aunt, the oneswe said 

stayed, had two children,m y brother's age, the boy, they were close f riends
 
as well as being cousins.  
T hey were together atonetim e.  Hehad 
--
 
my cousin Manf red hadgone to visit.  T he place he was, 
was ver y dangerousat that time.  He had to leave.  He went to stay with his parents. T here was an 

air raid. T hey went to a shelter and som ebody turned them  in, so they were deportedtoAuschwitz.  

And they didn't com eback.  My aunteventually cam e back, she was theonly one.  But they hada 

daughter who was two years old.  So m y parents got her.  I don't know how they kne w where
 
s h e 
was, but inhiding someplace.  So she was staying with us as well.  And I had no ideahow long I had 

stayed with the Vanderlindensaf terthe liberation. W hen 
--
 
on the day of  liberation, every house was 
decorated with Allied f lags, hugef lags. I don't know where people got them or how they madethem . 

23 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
T hey were the size of like double sheets hanging on thef ronts of houses, British, French, Am erican, 
Canadian. One house there was a redf lag.
 
And what I remem ber is one day I went outside and there were nof lags, which is ver y noticeable.  

Because all the color is gone. So I went back in and asked Mrs. Vanderlindenabout thef lags, where 

are thef lags? And she said, kindof  scared voice, the Germansm ight comeback.  Ididn'tknow until 

m uch later th
at this was the Battle of the Bulge, which was started in December.  SoI realized, I had 

been there since Septem ber through at least Christm as.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So at least threeorf our months continued with theVanderlindens?
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Af t e r 
we were liberated.  I askedm y brother. He's theonly one alive now. W hy 

was I with theVanderlindens still?  First of allthe war is over and we're free. He didn't know.  He said 

theapartm ent was very sm all andthere was not very m uchfurniture and it
 
was m y cousin,so I think 
probably 
--
 
I f eltmorecomfortable at this point with theVanderlindens than I did with my own f am ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Harry,  before we wrap up in just am oment, one last short questionfor you.  You 

stayed in contact with the Vanderlindens even af ter youm ovedto the United States?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  W e wrote regularly.  Not f requently, but regularly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. I'm  going to closeourprogram .  I'm  going toturn back to Harry in just a 

m om ent to close ourprogram forus. Before Ido that, I want to thank all of  you for being wit h us

thatnote, I turn it backto Harry to close our program  today.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hank you. Som e people ask, why didn't theJews resist? W hydid they go to 

thedeath like sheep?
 

Nazi, Germ any, invaded almostall of Europe. Poland,Belgium ,Luxem bourg, France, Greece,and 

the Soviet Union.  All
 
those countries hadarm ies,airf orces, with the exception of Russia,they were 
def eated within weeks.  Soalsom illions of people were killed by theNazis.  Mill ions.  People died 

during the war and that includes 3 anda half m illion battlehardened soviet prisoners of war who died 

in the handsof  theGerm ans. T hey died of starvation. T hey died ofexposure. They diedf rom  

disease, f rom  m edical experim entation.  Also executed outright.  And knowing that, I don't know 

anybody would expectunarm ed Jewish civi lians tofend off the German armies.
 
Inf act, Jews resisted.  They resisted inevery possible way, whatever wa y they could by imm igrating, 

and when it was no longer possible because there was noplace to go, they crossed borders illegall y.  

T hey hid. T hey passedf or Christians. T hey gave awa y their children to strangers.  They participated 

in undergroundactivities, attacksand soon. They also participated in sabotage in the Germ an 

m unitionsfactories where they worked as slave laborers, slave work ers. T hey organized rebellions in 

the ghettosand the concentration camps them selves. T hat doesn't sound like people going to their 

death like sheep.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Harry.
