SYLVIA KOLSKI 
 
March 29, 1990 
 
 
Q: Would you tell us your name  and where and when you were born?  
 
A: My name  is Sylvia Kolski. I was born Sylvia Karmaska
, and I lived in Tarczyn in Poland. 
 
Q: We re you known by any other name ?  
 
A: Uh...Well I was known for Sylvia in America, and in Paris Cecile, and in Poland as we were 
hiding                     
. That's all my names.  
 
Q: One of them was actually a boy's name . 
 
A: Yes.   
 because this place where we hiding was no woma n, and if some body hears my Cywia 
they would look for the woma n so they called me               
.  
 
Q: And when were you born?  
 
A: I was born 1925, September 15. 
 
Q: What do you reme mber about your life before the war?  
 
A: I was a little girl in a small town, going to school, comi ng from school, no boys, just 
homework and playing. My father was a wealthy ma n. My ma n was...if I reme mber my 
mother was never feeling well, so she has a special woma n taking care of...for the children, 
governess, and for her. And we had a ma id at home. It was a small town. Our town had only 

about 2,000 people. Uh...My father was...uh...taking care of the synagogue and                
, 
meaning riches. If some one had a store and ma ked a living, he was rich. My father had          
 
 you know and we...I think he was wealthy, and we were very happy. For the summe r we 
went to camps. I had three brothers. The first after me was Moshe, the second was Abraham, 

and the third was Fishel. There was younger, rich, but one year... We  were a happy family. 
My mother had 5 sisters and 1 brother. The brother was a very rich man. He didn't live too 

long in this town but he moved to Wa rsaw. Wa rsaw was like 32 kilome ters from Tarczyn, 
and with a bus it's 30 mi nutes away. So we very often went. My mother...like for a dress or 
for a hat or for something and always in Warsaw. And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war 

broked out. And in school, they told us we have to wear ma sks because they were afraid for 
the gas. They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came  home from 
school and the war broke out in September the 5th, 39,
1
 and my life was shattered right away 
because my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army. My father was only 39 
years old. So my fa ther was a very religious ma n. To the mill what he possessed he had two 
partners. One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in school when they

were young boys. My grandmother died when she was 28 years old. My father was 10 years 
old. And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one. So he was troubling 
and...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother. So they start like to 
doing business about 10, 11 years. And they remained after 60 years partners like they'r e just 

relatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today. So my 
father with this partner went to Warsaw to this Rabbi. What the Rabbi said if he will be 
going to the army or should he stay in Tarczyn or should he go to Wa rsaw. So the Rabbi said 

that he wouldn't go to the army. The Polish army doesn't  need him. He's too old, 39 years 
old. But he should come  to Wa rsaw. So my father came back the same  day and when I came  
home I...I saw that the maids are taking everythi
ng out from the closets and packing in sacks, 
in big, long sacks. So I said, "What's this? "   So my mother took me aside and she said, "Eat 
your supper.ﬂ I still reme mber what the supper was. Fish, fried fish. And..uh..we're going to 
Wa rsaw. And right away the me n came. He took all the possessions from the room, from our 

house and we had our own horses through the mill, you know, so everything like...was like 
a...we called this a Wa gen, you know, like you see in America when the...the...the Mexico, 
you know, and the horses, the big Wa gens, and we took every...I mean they took everything 

on the Wa gen and we went to Wa rsaw. Our family and my father's partner's family. My 
father stood still yet in Tarczyn, but my mother and the children and the maid and we came 
to Wa rsaw. It was a hectic night. The kids all were crying. We  were upset, and what we 

heard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting. So when we came  to Wa rsaw 
we came to a beautiful apartment, friends of mi ne parents were still....on the summer house 
because it was summe r in Europe and we...this was              
, and we took their apartment, 
but we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the 
building with the...you know, so we were afraid. So my mother called her brother if we could 
come  to him. So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle,                  
 23 in 
Wa rsaw. Two days later my father arrived and we been together. And that day the war 
started and there was fires and it was hell. But we still together. Not only us because then 
was bombed this...uh...uh....house on the Granichna
. So my father's partner came over with 
his family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped Warsaw. So the first 
day we wanted to go back to Tarczyn because in ghetto...it wasn't  yet a ghetto, but we were 
like, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind 

and what we had we left in the Granichna
 and it was bombed after two days. But my father 
went to a baker who bought from our business flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds, 
a 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt 
baked hallahs, bread, so we had to eat. But was a hard time with water. We didn't have water. 

So we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me , it was like a game  you know. We  
were small. We didn't understand so much...on a pot, a belt to carry the water and we went to 
the Visla (ph) for the water. It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded 

with water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. That's the way we brought the water. Till 
my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was 
my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding 

fr om the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday. I maybe get killed fr om the bombs.ﬂ And in 
the same  day my father was...went to the Rabbi with my two brothers on the                     
. He 
was...by the Rabbi...what he believed in this Rabbi, and a bomb went in...in this shelter and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114

the whole building came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you 
so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?"  So the Rabbi said, "Don't 
worry. You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren.ﬂ And all of a sudden like a 
window was opening in the ground, and my father was out from the...from the, you know, 

bombed out house, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. They 
were injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and 
they came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's apartment 

anymore because he lived in the third floor so we went to stay in a store in the same building. 
They had a dairy store with people. They didn't have children, two old people. So they 
agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself. He was a very holy ma n. 

And we also stood there. Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were 
standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. And then 
when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my 

father...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go 
there. So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you?  What I am going to do. 
Everything is bombed? "  And the Rabbi said, "Believe me . Not you....uh...not you mill is...is 

bombed.ﬂ In the same  town was my uncle. My mother's brother was a very rich ma n. He had 
a mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed 
and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. So my mother wasn't  able to go. 

We  didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn. So we start to walk. Myself, my 
father and mi ne...one of mi ne brothers, and my father's partner and his son. I will name  him 
Mr. Leshno
 and another two people. It was a distant relative of ours. He also went with his 
son to Tarczyn. 32 kilome ters. We  ma ked it in a few hours. We  get to come  home. But we 
came near to the town. The smell was terrible. From fire, from bodies, from sweat. It was 
very hot. And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house, 

and it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill. So we came back to 
the house. I opened the closet. It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we 
didn't finished our supper and what everything 
and all sugar and jam and everything because 
the war was going            
 we didn't suspect that we will have to run away. So that was good 
for us, that we had right away everything. Also a cousin of mi ne moved in to our apartment 
because her house was burned and she actually saved this house because...with water...was 
no fireme n at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go 

farther. And we were again happy to stay. Right?  As a child you ask me  what I reme mber. I 
remember I was afraid to sleep in my bed because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't 
sleep in a bed. I was always sitting or lying on the fl oor, no bed. So I went to mi ne aunt, 

mi ne father's sister to sleep. She had a restaurant in town, and she had a girl, my cousin, mi ne 
age. And we like each other very much. I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I 
don't want to sleep at home. So my mother said, "Fine.ﬂ Oh...and at the time my mother 

came also to the town back. And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody is alive, and 
the town had a square and a lot of Germans in it. And I was very much afraid and people 
were running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this 

night by my aunt. In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked some thing to 
my aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened. And they didn't want to tell me ...a 
child...what happened during the night. That the German with the Poles come into our house 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114

and they took out my cousin, the woma n's husband who let...who saved this house from the 
fire with my father with mi ne father's partner, Mr. Leshno
. They took him on the attic. They 
wanted money. So my father said he has no money. He has the mill. And it's after the war 
and I don't have money. And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a 
person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away. 

So my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without 
children, a nice old Jewish poor people. So he went into them and he sat til the morning 
there. But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. And it was the fi rst night in the 

town. So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my 
aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. It didn't took too 
long. It took about ma ybe 2 weeks. My father 
decided he's going to be free. He cannot live 
like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mi ne father's partner, Mr. Leshno
 will go to 
Russia. First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok
 (ph). They said 
goodbye to us and my mother was crying. She screamed, "I am already a widow. How do 
you leave me ? "   But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. So we 
rema ined in the town with the ma id. The ma id had no place where to go. It was a Jewish 

woma n. She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. And my father 
disappeared. We  didn't know what and where and what. Occasionally we got...I mean my 
mother got...just had the news. My mother sai
d, Oh, your father's fine and everything is 
alright. Maybe we'll some day be able to join him.ﬂ So...uh...we stood together in this 
Tarczyn, and nothing specially, you know. We  lived without... just with the hope that we will 
join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. (Sigh)  Then one day what I 

reme mber, my mother said, "We're out of money and I have to go to Wa rsaw to Mr. Flynn. 
Mr. Flynn was a Polish German. That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in 
Poland. And he had...uh....we call it here commi ssioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of 

money so ma ybe he could give us some  money. So my mother left and my younger brother 
got very sick and I didn't know what to do. I was like the woma n of the house so I called a 
neighbor. She was a nurse. And she give him so
me  me dication and make us not cry and the 
ma id was very good to us. And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a 
car and they went to this bakery. And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know 
if they went by druska
 we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw, 
another rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and 
with my cousin and my...my father's partner said, "I think I see Frymet.ﬂ Frymet was my 
mother's name . So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with 

my...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn 
to this...uh...man. And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they me et on 
the...met on the street. What a coincidence. So this was a happiest day for us. My brother's 

very sick and here I have my father back and my mother. Instead we'r e supposed to go to my 
father, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to 
make their mi nd or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in 

Russia or they'r e going back. So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a 
mi xup. Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they'r e going. This was my 
recollection as a little girl what I remembered. And...uh...my father came back and he was 

more calml y, wasn't  afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114

business again. And this...uh...Germa n Pole from the bakery gave him money. I mean he 
payed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. I wouldn't say no. Again I 
didn't have any worry as a child. School wasn't  any more for us. So my parents hired...uh... a 
tutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. Wa sn't  much, but was enough 

to...to go along, you know. And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that 
my father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went 
with Mr. Leshno
 once to Warsaw. I carried the money and one day a German came over, not 
to me , to Mr. Leshno
 and he took him away to work. And I didn't know what to do with me , 
but I know what where to go. So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. And I start to 
cry. They took him away and... So they said, "It's nothing. They catch people to work. He 
will be soon there.ﬂ And good enough he came in the night. He finished the work what they 

told him to do and he came and we came back to Tarczyn. This was my last time I went. I 
didn't want to go anymore. And we stood in this Tarczyn and life went on til it was very bad. 
And my uncle...they start to talk about the ghetto in Warsaw, so my uncle decide that he 

wants to come  to live back in Tarczyn because he was from Tarczyn because he got so rich 
so he went to live in...in Wa rsaw. So in the meantime they ma ke also from Tarczyn...uh...a 
ghetto...that all the Jews have to be in one side. Uh...Everybody in the town liked my father 

because by him it was no different. Jew, Chris
tian. He didn't eat alone. He ate if everybody 
had food. He didn't sit down to the table to the seder. That was...you asked me  what I 

remember. I just remember we were 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock still by the table, sleeping children 

because he run to the houses to see if this people had food. If not he carried from our home 
for them. As a little girl I remember many times before a holiday I was very         
 like 
children in school. My father ma kes like a nut in a handkerchief. There probably was money, 

no doubt about it, and go here and here. Don't say from who. Just give it. So a Christian 
person who was...uh...couldn't say he's a friend, a person from the town came to my father 

and he says, "Mr. Karmaski
, Too bad they'r e a ma king a ghetto, the son of a bitches.ﬂ Excuse 
me . "But can we change with apartments. I know you have a clean house and I have small 
children and I would like to change with you because he was living in the side what the 
German give us. And we changed with him. So my uncle, with his family...he had two sons 

and a wife and a ma id...so they came to live with us. And it was also, as a child it was happy 
for me . It was harmless you know, a lot of children and we had our curfew. We  couldn't go 
out like in the evening, but it was nice. We were...we lived nicely in this Tarczyn til they 

decide that it's not good. Everybody has to go to Wa rsaw ghetto. Our small town had 350 
families. So being in ghetto in Tarczyn a lot of people got...the poor got poorer, and the rich 
ones survived. They ate, but the money didn't come  in so it was very very bad. (Sigh)  So we 

packed our possessions, what we could. I, as the older daughter, I was sent to Wa rsaw. 
(Clearing Throat)  Excuse me . I was sent to Wa rsaw, also on a Wa gen, with mi ne friend, 
that's mean my father's partner. They still were partners, and we went to my uncle so my 

uncle went back too            
 his apartment in Wa rsaw and being a few days with my uncle, 
he...uh ...uh... rent a room for us by a family. This was Carmaliska
 15. So I stood there with 
our ma id and with my two brothers and my mother and my father came the last day when 
they had to go out from Tarczyn. So we lived in ghetto already. And from the whole Poland, 
from everybody from each each town, everybody came into...to Wa rsaw. And Wa rsaw was 

already a ghetto. Was a small ghetto and a big ghetto. Carmaliska
 15 belonged to the big 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
6  
 
ghetto. Uh...My father received every couple weeks, couple weeks I couldn't say, once a 
month, once in 2 months, and from time to time we knew from which time to...from the mill 
a salary. The good thing was because we had a partner also, beside Mr. Leshno
. A Christian. 
He was in the governme nt, in the Polish governme nt, a big shot. A president, but not a 

president like you have...uh...President Bush or something, but he was something. I really 
can't  explain it what that he was a big shot. When the war came out in 1939, he called my 

father and he said, "Listen, Karmaski
, I am going to leave you. I am going to America with 
my wife. His name  was President...President Shelpelski
. And he left. After the war, when I 
came to America I me t his wife. She was living in Long Island. And she said to me , "Please, 
Mrs. Karmaski
...(she didn't know my married name)..."I want you to tell my neighbors from 
where I am comi ng and who I was in Poland because I don't know if they believe me . 

She...her husband died, and she was living very poor. Matter of fact, I bought her Chanel 5, 
and she hugged me  and it was very happy. When we went to the ghetto, this President...this 

President Shelpelski left a daughter, a married daughter from the 5th marriage. This was the 
second of his...in Poland. Her husband was a ma jor. The daughter's husband was a ma jor in 
the Polish army, and she was by herself in the mill. Of course, she had workers and she...and 

a boy friend. The boy friend was a terrible anti-Semite. She was afraid for him, for Bollick
 
that she's helping us. But Richard, the engineer, was a very nice guy. I met him many times 
and he gave me  money when I was hiding. And I thank to the mill with his wife because 
nobody from from the Poles would take us in without money and without promises that after 

the war, they will be big shots or rich. (Sigh)  Anyway...so that was our support from them. 
Comi ng back to the Wa rsaw ghetto, as we received money from them we saw it's getting 
tighter and tighter and tighter. Of course, I c
ouldn't say that I felt anything, but as a child I 
wasn't  going to say that I wanted to knew much secrets from the...from the growing up 
because they always shhhh shhhhh not to tell the children. But from day after day you pick 
up some  words. Right?  Uh...My father decided...he was afraid to go to court. It was a court 

on Leshno
 which was divided in half. Half was standing in the Christian side and half in the 
ghetto. The woma n who brought us in the money came to court. My father had a piece of 
paper. It wasn't  really....he ordered himself that he has a court this and this day. The German 
didn't know what it is when he willed in through the revealing doors. He went in. He me t this 

woma n, and she gave him the money. She got paid for it. She took right away up her 
percentage. And then my father shared with my...with his partner. So we had a few dollars to 
live. There weren't too hungry. We  weren't too well off, but we were okay. One day my...my 

uncle came to us and he said it's not good. I heard this rumors and this rumors. You have a 
few dollars. I have a few dollars. Let's do some thing. So from the Rabbi what my father was 
believing so much, he had acquainting ma n. This ma n before the war he wasn't  a farmer but 

he had cows in Warsaw, and for the sake of the cows he selled the mill and he lived. So this 
ma n talked in my father to buy cows, and they could buy them and they transport 
them...Polish people transport them to the ghetto. So my father and my father's partner and 

my uncle and another few Jews shared it. It was very expensive. And they had like a dozen 
cows. Analefski Street
. It was a like from a big store ma de...uh...a place for the cows and 
they hired a couple, the ma n and the wife what they milked, you know... Is this word they 

call?  milked...uh...cows. And the 5th you had to give the donations for the poor, and for the 
opens, the milk and then the rest you could sell. So from this we lived. My father woke up 5 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
7  
 
o'clock. The mi nute he could work, you know, free to...it's safe to go, so he went to this...to 
see how many liters or quarts what we call here...the milk, the cows were giving and all the 
families lived. Not to ma ke money, but we lived. Okay. And then I...my mother said that 
father is very tired and ma ybe he shouldn't go and we children we should go because the 

mi nute when you walked out from the door to the street it was unbelievable to see. Young 
people and old people like flies, deaths, deaths, deaths. Fallen people, hunger people, on the 
street. So my father didn't go but us children 
we went. Me and my brothers and from the 

partner the son went and whatever was left we were carrying the milk in special cans, you 
know, to the apartment and from the apartment we had our places what we bought milk. We  
got paid from people say they pay another time the 20 cents or the 50 cents what it was 

container of milk. I lived there went there. And I think we lived I wouldn't a happy life, but 
we lived. Uh...We had...mine mother had a sister living in Sobolif
 near Lublin and another 
sister who lived in Wa rsaw also in ghetto got very poor. She didn't have any money. So they 

decide to shift her to this other aunt to Sobolif
 so she went with her sons there. And we stood 
in ...in Warsaw ghetto and many times people came with regards from their were     
 very 
religious town so we could get from time to time a kosher meat, what they smuggled in 

from...not from this town, from Sobolif
 or from Otvorz (ph)
, and they came to the ghetto and 
they had their clients or sometimes we had meat also which was a holiday at this time. And 

this was til 1942. 1942 my cousin came, my father's sister's daughter from a small town. I 
don't know the town. I don't remember. (clearing throat)  That...uh...her brother-in-law and 

other relatives were kidnapped. She called this kidnapped. And she escaped. She doesn't  how 
and she still doesn't  know how she came to Wa rsaw ghetto, and we should have known that 
they killing Jews. And in the same time they said that the Jews will live til July 22. And it 

start to be like, you know, not easy. Not easy! And then it started that every Jew should 
work. I never worked. I was a child. So my father had a lot of connections. He came  home 
and he said, "I think I ma naged some thing.ﬂ And what my father did started it. So they 

brought...they bribed some body that I went into work. My work was by the Germans...it's 
called a shop. This was Tebin
's shop. There was slavery, and they worked for the Germans, 
for the army, of course. Tailors and hat ma kers, a shop. A big shop. For me  it was like, I 

never saw this. My work was...uh...sitting by a table and it was in a bags a lot of hats and the 
elastic in front by the heads were sewed down from the tailors, but there and there was a 

string, you know, so I had to clean up the thread and cut with the scissor. I had a scissor. It's 
not big work. It was...only if they would let us work because every mi nute a German came  in 
and hit us or took us out. Some  he took out never came back. Some  they took out they raped. 

So we were always afraid. I...my mother worked also in the same  building. I worked on the 
fifth floor. She worked on the second floor. Sh
e stamped leather pieces. Little pieces what 
they...to suitcases or what you're wearing on the back the shoulder, you know. What you call 
this?  
 
Q: Shoulderpatch. 
 
A: So this kind of... My bro...my father also worked by the same  thing and the brother too. I had 
by the time already two brothers, not three because one was selected. It was...they came and 
they took him out. They took out everybody. And th ey took him. He was hiding in one of the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
8  
 
hiding place in the apartment. They took him out to the Umschlag. Uh...As they were 
working one day they start to give us Kenncards. This was like a piece of paper which opens 
and said that you allowed to live...in German not in Polish. Everything was in German. I 
didn't know what the line is for it. They took us out to make a line so, of course, I stood in 

the line. So I was scared. I received a card like this. I didn't know what it is. And many 
people...the one who didn't receive, they told go in the right or in the left. Actually in the left. 
I was to the right. You know, as I am talking, I could... And after they said, "Let us go back 

to work.ﬂ And we saw it's mi ssing a lot of people from these for...but we didn't know for 
what. We  didn't know if they'r e going to live or we going to live. But we were the lucky one. 
The same day my father received a card like this. My mother wasn't  working this day 

because they ma ke the come  in the nighttime for work. It was a 24-hour work. So my father 
received a card like this and I received a card. But then we knew it already what it is. That 
it's very important. Okay?  So we the lucky one. And the same  time they maked me ...not to 

come  during the day but to come ...that's how they mi xed up people...to come  in the night to 
work. So I went like 4:30, 5:00. Most...I wanted to go earlier because you were more safe in 
the place where you walk because during the day you don't see anybody in the street and 

this...the apartments were looted. But the time I wasn't  living anymore Karmiliska
 15, but we 
were told into Novolitki
 (ph) 42. This was also a friend of my father's who went to live with 
his daughter and he give us up his apartment. So we lived there and my father's partner too. 
It was like four families living in one big apartment. We couldn't...we didn't have many beds. 
I was sleeping with my mother. My brothers were sleeping on the floor. I think my father 

also on the couch or some thing. It doesn't  ma tter, but it wasn't  already what it was. And we 
still had the maid. I mean she was like in the family. It was no more maid, but like a family. 
And then one day they came and they took her away with my cousin. And we went to work 

and by work they said that we'r e going to live...I mean people just gossip...til July 22. And 
was even a song about it.  
 
Q: Do you reme mber it?  
 
A: The song...if I reme mber it. Wa s some thing from my long home I could get out some  more, 
but very little. Very little. As I say til this point, til I went to work, I...I...childish...you know, 

I didn't give too much thought about it. I'm young and I didn't think about it. I didn't realize 
that there could be such a terrible thing done to people. Uh...So finally it came, this day. 

That's when we...that we heard...it was all over the whole ghetto. Papers pasted out that all 
the Jews had to come  to one spot and this was this spot. It was three shops in the whole 
ghetto. One shop...(clearing throat)...one shop was Tebins
, the biggest one. The other one 
was...uh...I just reme mbered. Fo Broczes
 (ph) I don't...I just remembered it. Schultz. Schultz 
was working the same  work what we. So the...the...the rumors were that Schultz and Tebins 
were going to go together. And the Broczes
 (ph) which was in the small ghetto, they only 
work by Broczes
 (ph). They will rema in. But it...it was just rumors, you know. (Sigh)  So we 
were living....this was already a good life. H
ungry, working, and no future. Uh...But when 
these signs on the streets were that everybody has to come in one place, my mother didn't 
have a card. So I took out this card and I said, "Mommy, this is your card and you go with 

daddy and you take both children"...because my brother is very small. My age I was 14 I 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114

guess. I was already big. I was very tall and thin. They wouldn't let me through anyway. I 
don't consider any more a child. So you go with this brothers. And we were sure we'r e going 
to work. And I said to my mother, "You write Mommy. You will write me .ﬂ And hardly my 
mother accept this Kenncard, but she did accept. Until the mi ddle of 18 we still could work 

together in the lines. Was six people in the line, end of it, and the line it was really not to 
prescribe...not to describe how long it was. It
 was a terrible way down. The heat was ma ybe 
a 150. Nobody had a drink. The          
 on the back, the shoulder bags...everybody had a bag. 
I had a few slices of bread and I think an onion in it and my clothes and like a girl, you 

know, a pair of shoes. I also...when my house was looted in...uh...Karmi ska
 15, I went back 
with the ma id so I find my mother's beautiful pair of snake shoes and I always liked them so 

I took the shoes and I took them to mi ne so I was holding the shoes too. As we was ma rching 
I saw in the line my aunt and my uncle. That's the rich one. And her two sons. And another 

aunt, my mother's sister. And we couldn't talk, but we waved. With our eyes we ma ke like 
"God knows where we'r e going.ﬂ but still going. We  know we going to the Umschlagplatz 
because this was Miller 18
, and around the streets there. I was also...on the sixth I was with 
my friend, Henry Leshno, my cousin and his brother and another two girls. I didn't know 
them. I know them only from the shop. And this girl was probably mi ne age, but she had her 
mother and her father. And I was really jealous because all three had cards and I didn't had a 

card. I think this was my first time when I start to be jealous of anybody. And thank God this 
girl survived and her parents survived. Not the war, but to come  back. And we were in the 
line. Because I didn't had a card, and my uncle and my aunt didn't had a card, so we went to 

the...with them, and I separate from my mother in case...and no words to talk, but crying and 
crying and write and don't worry. Ma, your health you know, and you will survive and we'll 
survive this. As a child, you know, I could feel I didn't have too much words to...to comfort 

her, and she and my father went different place because they had the cards. My mother was 
struggling with me. She wants me to get a card, but I was very much against it. I felt young 
and strong. And they went away. As we came to Moranofska
 (ph), with us all and we stood 
and I said to this Henry...he was like a brother to me...I said, "Henry, we don't know where 
we are. We  here with the aunt with this, but why can't  we still go to be with my mother...with 
our parents.ﬂ He had a second mother, but very good woma n and like I start...I was...I'm a 

little older. He's alive. We'r e very good friends. And I start to agitate him, "Let's go. Let's 
go.ﬂ And we went. Me...and I ma ke his brother also to come , and the three of us start to look 
for my parents. And as we'r e looking on the Miligas
 we knew a lot of people and they said, 
"Oh, you're father is looking for you.ﬂ In the same time my father start looking for us 
because they saw it's...it's not true. Everybody could still still be together. Was a terrible hot 
day. Humi d. Hot. Without a little water. Finally, we find my father. My father said, "Thank 

God, we find you.ﬂ And we came to Miller 22
. There is the place where my mother sat on 
the floor by the house and about an hour or so even my uncle come  with his wife because we 
saw we'r e not separate. We could be all together and we find a lot of people. But this time 
my father...not only my father, but everybody...was
 starting to look to buy this Kenncardes . 
So, of course, my father was starting to look for me  for one. Couldn't get! But my mother 
said,                   
 They don't let parents with children through. Just the opposite. Let me give 
back to Cywia the card. And you go with Cywia and I stay behind with my family, with the 

brothers, with the sisters. She still had her brother. And with her fr iends. And if it's possible 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
10 
 
you come  with us or send for us. People went out...uh...with on the wagons as dead people, 
shoveled in...in the casket you know and went out so we thought ma ybe this way. A lot of 
people had bunkers in the houses and they went in. They didn't give us too much time, as by 
5 o'clock they already...the Germans come  with the "Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt...and the 

machine guns went boom, boom, boom a whole day. (Big Sigh)  And they start to organize 
the line, who's going to go left, who's going to go right. You never knew what the left line is 
or the right line is. Okay?  So here it goes so quick. My father start to say goodbye and in the 

mi ddle he fainted by saying goodbye to my mother. And I stay with the Kin
 card in the hand 
and I don't know what to do, and what to say. My mother's hand with me  I should put down 
this...uh...how do you call it?  
 
Q: Knapsack. 
 
A: Knapsack. Right. Knapsack. You want to know
 that she give me her knapsack, not mi ne, 
hers, with all her dresses. There were a few pieces of bread and an onion inside. An onion, 

everybody had an onion because they said an onion is good for you. And she took mi ne. As 
my father was fainting, my aunt catched a piece of paper. Wa ter...was no water, and start to, 

you know, revive him, and I said to my mother, "Go hide in this place.ﬂ And she kissed me  
and it's no more words. What can words say?  And I am walking with my father out and 
Leshno
 with his son and the rest of the people who wanted without Kenncard is go...could 
also stay in the line. It doesn't  ma tter if you have a Kenncard or not. Everybody was to make 
a line and to go. So this Leshno
's brother...I handled him the picture frame. He was always 6 
foot, strong like a ox, was will us in the line. They took him away this way and us in this 

way. We  didn't know where we going. But what I witnessed before was a ma n before my 
line, before my face. He had on a enormous big knapsack. His name  was Wa ssermann. He 

worked with me  by Tebins, not cutting...this was the woma n's work. He was sewing the hats. 
He was a very wealthy ma n before the war, but in the war he got poor and then got he he 
went into work to Tebins and he had a little girl about 3 years old. He had her every day by 

work and if the Germans came in, myself and Dr. Bussow...I was working, also cutting. Dr. 
Bussow was a nice lady. Her husband was a physician, children doctor...took this little girl in 
this box and covered her with the heads she should survive the, you know, the Germans what 

they came in to watch us work. He had this little girl in the knapsack. He gave her some pills 
to sleep and not to move and they took out this little girl and killed her in my eyes. I should 
say in our eyes we saw it. And they took him also away beating. So I was happy in my 

memory that my mother didn't see this and didn't go through because she had small children. 
My brothers were small. So we went this way and they went this way and sure enough...of 
course, when I passed I showed the card and they let me through. I was very tall on my age 

and very thin. And this Dr. Bossow
 said to me , "You have two bright eyebrows and the 
German don't like this.ﬂ So she took me in aside as we were walking, still in the shop, and 
she plucked out mi ne eye brows, and I was screaming because it was hurting. Come  out. 
They didn't go out (laugh) the places. Okay. So I was fortunate that they took me  back. I 

didn't me ntion that as we went to the Umschlag Plaza place, some body fell in this line, and 
the German run and right away it's like a pyramid. One fell, other falls, other falls. So they 
shoot in to this pyramid and like before me. Maybe I would fell too if I didn't see where I am 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
11 
 
approaching, you know, what I am approaching to go on. They shoot everybody was the 
whole pyramid of people, young, old, whoever fell. So when we went back, everybody was 
already tired, in tears, and this street looks
 terrible. Very bad. Possessions from people, 
hanging people from balconies what the Germans shoot them because they want to escape. 
(Sigh)  We  didn't know where we'r e going. But they took us to the shop back. So we were 
lying a whole night on the floor. Mostly were me n, not ma ny woma n. And I started this girl 
what I was jealous on her...with her mother and father. And in my heart I felt I never see my 

mother again so I really was very jealous. And there crying the whole night and my heart 
was breaking seeing for the first time in my life my father's crying, and he felt very 
uncomfortable like that he left my mother, like I felt this like maybe he exchanged me for her 

life. So. 
 
Q: We  have to stop here. The tape is about to run out. We'r e going to change it. Okay. If you'll

Q: Okay. You can go ahead now. You were saying you that you felt that your father had 
exchanged you for your mother. 
 
A: Yal. I felt like this, but he really didn't. He wasn't  this person that he lived with the hope that 
he would still be able to do something because people came back from this...from this miller
. 
But other hope was that we knewed where she is. She was not Miller 18
, but Miller 22
, and 
she stood, uh...together with my uncle and with my aunt and with friends and with the sisters 
from Mr. Leshno and his wife and children so...and I was only my father and Leshno with 
his son. And the same  day my cousin come , my uncle's son. He went through this with my 

uncle and with my aunt and the other son, but they took them, the three of them away and he 
received the Kenncard so he came to the...to the shop so we heard from him some  news. This 
was...uh...the same  day...he came a day later, but the same  day he went to the selection. So 

we knew they stayed together so our hope wa
s ma ybe we could so some thing. So the night 
was a terrible grieve...so in a terrible grieve. My heart was breaking. How my father was 

crying, and all these men. Like I mentioned there was a lot of men, more than woman and I 

was still considering myself a child there. And so in the morning we got breakfast. The 
breakfast was watered like a soup but like water but off in the line standing for the line for 
the soup, this day wasn't  a working day, but like after a funeral day you know. So we got the 

soup standing in the line and my father saw some body so he went over and he said in the 
hope so he said to my father, "Give me  your 
picture...give me  your wife's picture which I 
have the picture still. He wrote it down. My mother's name and my two brothers name. He 
went back and forth. He was the forema n from Tebins. Through him I went into work in the 
beginning. My father paid but like a bribe, you know, and he took the picture went into the 
Umschlagplatz in the Miller  and he couldn't find my mother. That was his response. The 

money he didn't give back, but he give back 
the picture, but he couldn't find. Okay?  So was 
no hope that they will come . The day went on and this was already July 23. July 24 we start 

to work. You know the work has to be done. Uh...I was still by the same  work with the 

Kennkarte. They ma ke me  work at night time and my father worked in the day. We  came  to 
the same apartment on the...it was like          
. From    
  excuse me . From        
 to the         
. 
And this was our apartment. There what my father obtained with his friend. He went to live 

with his daughter. I don't think he's alive at the time already, but it was too big apartment so 
we were there...my father and myself, Leshno and his son, and my cousin and another two 

people with two children. He worked for the Germans. He...uh...he wasn't  a shoema ker. He 
was sewing the leather of the shoes. I don't know in English this word what this... Before you 
ma ke the shoes...a shoe, you know, the leather has to be sewn together so then the 

shoema ker takes the shoes to ma ke. Anyway he worked for the Germans, but he didn't have 
a place where to live so he lived with us because...he moved in by himself. Apartment was 
empty so. So then we agreed that he should have a room and we lived together. And day and 

night we went to work. We  came back. We  didn't have any food. We  lived only what they 
gave us, but my father had a few gold pieces sewn in his shoes or on the suit and I also had 
before we went like the everybody had some  money because we didn't go...maybe we knew 

it inside, but nobody want to say. We  were sure we'r e going to work for the Germans, ma ybe 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
13 
 
to Germany, ma ybe by         
 summe rtime or whatever you know. So we had a few dollars. I 
mean slotas
 not dollars in case we have to buy something, a piece of bread or to bribe 
somebody. The bribe was terrible in Poland at this time between the Jews also. So as a child 
I was wearing stockings but I didn't wear a belt, but elastic. So two eleastic together and in 
between was money sewn around. That was mi ne possession. So little by little we came  over 

to this because we didn't have anything to live on it. And that's how we lived til 1943. The 
rumors were that the ghetto wouldn't stay too long, that they will finish us. And in between 
they opened the Umschlagplatz. No more transportations. I mean they liquidated the ghetto 

little by little. The same thing and they opened the ghetto and they heard we were fr ee fr om 
work, that the ghetto was open, the miller. We  run, myself, my father, everybody, the whole 
shop run there to look for relatives. We went straight to Miller 22 because we know we left 

there my mother. We came...on the street somebody screamed, "Uncle Mendel.ﬂ My father's 
name  was Mendel. This was my aunt's little boy, 8...7...8 years old. He was together with 
everybody, with my mother, with the brother in the bunker. So we asked him, "Where is 

everybody? "  We  didn't have to go further. He gave us all the report. He told us what 
happened. Two woma n in the building had a fight. I don't know all the words. And the 
Germans heard because they were snooping around with the dogs. So they came in and they 

find the place that there is a bunker and they were hiding there and they start to scream that 
they'r e going to put a tear bomb in the ducts. They should come  out so they will be free to 
work and live. Otherwise, they will be shot. So everybody went down. This little boy didn't 

go out. He sit and he survived. My brother, the youngster, didn't go out, but my mother didn't 
want to leave, that she should come  down. She wouldn't leave without him. So the Germans 
stayed til he came down. That's the version fr om this little cousin of mi ne. And then when he 

came down they left and took them all to the train. This was day before our New Year, 
exactly September 9, 42. So we know so much about it. But everybody said, "Let's go.ﬂ He's 
a child. Maybe he doesn't  know. You have to touch it to believe it. So we came to this house 

and when they saw me ...a few people..."Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child. Your mother 
showed us pictures from you. She was crying all the day. Poor woma n if she wouldn't go 
out.ﬂ So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true. As we were 

there the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people 
from the street because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card. So we start 
to...to hide again. But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I...we came...my father, 

myself and the rest of us back to the shop. We didn't go back to the apartment. We were 
afraid that ma ybe they will take us away. We  wanted to spend as much as we could in the 
shop. It wasn't  safe, but better than at home. You know I worked in the night time. I...I fell 

asleep during the day. I couldn't sit in the shop. They wouldn't let me in. So I stood mostly in 
the apartment. And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, "You know, I 
am looking for you. Your son come  to me  from Miller 22"...he was also from the MIller 

22..."and he said, "David, maybe you have a better...better bunker where I could hide with 

my brother and my mother. I have the money. I will give you.ﬂ And he told this my father. 
And I said, "In my bunker is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't 
take him.ﬂ So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with 

mother. But he said, "Please believe me. I couldn't do it.ﬂ This man was a very selfish man 
and a very rich ma n. So my father said, "And what you doing now.ﬂ "I have no place where 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
14 
 
to go.ﬂ So my father said, "It's okay. Come  to my house.ﬂ And he with his wife and child 
came to live together in our house. I give even away my bed to his wife because she was a 
very sick woman. She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old. This woman 
survived the war thanks to me . Many days I didn't go to the shop. I was afraid and my work 

was in the night. So I was hiding under my covers and I said, "I don't care if I live or not. 
What do I have to lose. My mother is not here. My father is working. I can't talk to him. And 
I have...I am always hungry. I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook. So what's 

the use of living.ﬂ So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woma n was very 
nice, but she had what to eat and she never shared. She never would say, "Oh, Cywia take a 
biscuit or something.ﬂ No. Mine little cousin when we met him. He was a child. He stole 

from her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, "You know, you 
have nothing to lose. Go over the...the gates. Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my 
friend. She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry. Maybe she will give you 

a place to live. He went. He came back. He came back. He ate a good meal. He brought me  a 
bread. Okay. So this family...he had a lot of money. She was hiding two little sacks under my 
mattress. She was afraid. I never looked in into the          
 believe me and I didn't care. And 
one day, looking out from the window...was in the day time, I saw that the building was like 
this that Germans are in the building. They are looking for people. So I took the cover over 
my head. And I said, "I don't care. If they come, they will come.ﬂ So she put the little girl 

under my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the door, 
but nobody was open. It was like dumb. Pretend there is nobody there. After a few mi nutes it 
was quiet and so they went away. Okay?  (Sigh)  Since this day, I said I am not staying here 

anymore. Because it was in my head if they ta
ke this little girl and I will see how they kill 
her...how they will kill me, I don't care. I wouldn'
t know it. But to see before how they kill 
her, I don't want to see it. So I went to work. I mean I didn't work because my work was into 

the night. And I stood there as much as I could. So I stood there. Okay. My father find out 
that...uh...my two cousins are alive and they work by the brocz
 (ph) shop in the brocz
 (ph) 
shop. I also forgot to mention that in the ghetto when I still had this good life in the ghetto I 

went from day to day with mi ne...we were lived together with more people in the apartment. 
Uh...So I me t              
. Maybe you heard about him. What I went there because cousin's little 
boys to...uh...were sheltered there. My father's sister's children. And I don't know. It was a 
holiday or something and it was like a children's theater and my aunt said to me maybe you 
would come to see. So I went. My grandfather was still alive. He died in ghetto in January 

1941...or may it was in 42. I think 41. And my father maked a separate burial because there 
was...in dozens they put. But he was a very religious ma n and a decent ma n so he dug by 
himself the...the graves. So I went and I met there a lot of people and I met him too. (Sigh)  

So this was the life in ghetto til my father came and he was talking with people and the 
rumors were that the ghetto wouldn't be too long that Tebins and Schultz are going together. 
We  have to look to escape the ghetto. Where to escape nobody knows. But people did if they 

were bought...uh...Polish papers that they not more Jews, but Poles. I couldn't do this 
because I looked very much as a Jew. I thought a German wouldn't recognize me if I am tall 
Jew or a Pole. But the anti-Semitism in Poland was terrible. Ninety percent of Poles worked 

hand in hand with the Jews....with the Germans. So...but in the other way you didn't have 
nothing to lose. So one day this couple came  to my father. They didn't have children. They 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
15 
 
were from our town. They were also in ghetto. And they said, "We have some body. We 'r e 
going to go to them. If you want, ma ybe you could join us.ﬂ They ma ybe wouldn't confirm 
this to my father, but they were looking for money in case if the people wouldn't take them 
without money. So ma ybe my father could pay for them too and this way they will go. So 

my father said, "In this mi nute I am not considering so much myself but mi ne baby, my 
daughter.ﬂ So he...my father came to me  and he said, "What would you say?  Would you like 
to go with Lea and Abraham to the Irish side.ﬂ I said, "Not by myself. Only with you.ﬂ It was 

summer when they took away my mother. I didn't have any other clothes. I didn't have 
winter clothes. So my father went and bought me
 a pair of boots and he prepared me and still 
from ghetto not woma n, mostly me n, young boys went out to the Polish side. They called 
this the Irish side to work. They could have come  in with two potatoes with a half bread, 
whatever, you know, and that's like the other people could buy and live also. So one day my 
father come s and says, "They are leaving soon and I am convinced that you should go.ﬂ So 

when Leshno
 heard that I am going, he wanted to send his son too. And by the time was a 
person who lived actually in...in the wilderness there in the small town, going from 
room...from farmer to farmer and they knew him and they give him some thing to survive. So 
he went out with Leshno, with this young boy. Uh...And my father came and he said, "Now 

is the time and you're going in 2 days and don't tell anybody where you're going.ﬂ But I 
couldn't hold a secret. I said, "If I want to survive, I would like my cousin to survive.ﬂ But 
this time this little boy wasn't  with us. We  send him out. Go and look you should live. 

Because a child, they didn't know he is Jewish. He was a blond, pretty little boy. So he 
wasn't  anymore with us. And everybody was laughing with that...his face like this. I had long 
braids, black and really looking like a Jewish girl
, but my Polish was perfect. (Sigh)  It's...I 
mean I had no other opportunity. My father says, "But I wanted to...leave my secret to my 
other cousin. He was a very intelligent boy. He was older than I was, few years. And I said, 
"Listen      
, anytime you escape the ghetto, come to this and this place, I knew already this 
place. My father told me because in 2 days I have to leave. But don't write it down. Just 
knew it. He was Wa rsaw born
. He spoke already 5, 6 languages, very intelligent. Very 
intelligent boy. So, fine. So I had a little guilty on my chest that I let go my secret. And the 

German was bribed by some body who went out for work that I would be on his 
workma nship today. So, of course, I been 7 o'clock in the morning in the winter dressed in 

the boots and a coat. The coat was mi ne, and nothing with me. . I couldn't hold nothing either 
one. But I was wearing like 10 shirts and my mother's dresses here and there. That's what I 
had with me . And I also could have had some thing because I am going to work so I had 

some  package and I had a       
. You know, a       
. I didn't know I am not supposed to have 
this because the German were afraid that you have a bomb or ammunition inside, but I didn't 
know it. And from this place I was instructed to come next building and there is a...like 
a...also a German workshop where the Jews what they go out worked there. And they were 

working in leather. So I came in. These two...this couple came in before. They weren't on the 
same ...uh...work out. This German was bribed. I don't know how much and what. But I was 
separated from this people and I went in to this shop and I supposed to be in hiding and this 

guy knew it, the forema n that I am comi ng in. When the forema n saw me ...his father was a 
friend of my father. My father had a lot of connections. And he says to me , "You going in 
the Irish side. You fall like a fly. With a face like this, even if you polish your           
. So I

said, "Benny, what do I have to lose? "   I said to him. He didn't survive. I survived. Why. I 
am asking this question always myself. And my best. I ask, "Why, God, was I the fortunate? "  
 And til late afternoon we stood there. I supposed to follow this couple because I don't know 
where we'r e going in Wa rsaw. From there we supposed to be transport again. This was 

Wa rsaw. This was        
. I knew very well Warsaw, but since they separated small ghetto, a 
big ghetto and here you could go and here you can't  go so I was really was very mi xed up. 
But I followed them. I followed them and I walked. We  supposed to go          
. There is the 
airport from Poland from Wa rsaw. I followed them. And it was snowing and you didn't see 

ma ny people. And I always hold a handkerchief to my nose because my nose was the ma in 
trouble because a long nose don't look like Irish. All of a sudden I heard, "Cywia,  Go. Go.ﬂ I 

am afraid to look back, but whose calling Cywia? I am following these two people and I am 
afraid to lose my eye on them. My father. What happened?  What happened that he 
heard...somebody came to tell him that he...if he wouldn't leave today, he could never leave 

again. So he and Leshno bribed also to some body by the work some body and they took a 
taxi on the Polish side and they went off. They knew Wa rsaw very well and he follows me . 
But til he told me the story was 5, 6 hours later. But, thank God, I see him. Right? He was 

dressed up like a farmer and he looked...he was very thin and the mustache what he never 
wore it in specially for this occasion, he let it go. His Polish wasn't  too good. But he came. 
And as we'r e walking, this people...this couple, I didn't see them any more. I didn't know 

where I'm going, but my father knows, but he went into the wrong door. He opens the door. 
It was night. And this woma n says, "Karma ski
, what you doing here? "   And my father got 
pale and I stay here and, "Who is this? "   He said, "That's my daughter.ﬂ This was from 

Tarczyn, from mi ne town, a woma n I didn't know her because she was mostly in Wa rsaw 
living in the same place. And when the German came she started work as a prostitute. And 

she lived with the Germans. And I...we didn't know from this. Later on, we knew it. When 
she saw us, she said, "Well, as much as I like to help you, the Germans will be here in a half 
hour.ﬂ And she start to pull out drawers and pull out big pieces like the table clothes, the 

covers to cover the windows because we'r e here. My father says, "Don't bother. How is your 
father? "   "Oh, he's fine. He lives in the same  place. You probably will see him if you go to 
Tarczyn.ﬂ And "Where you going? "  So my father says, "I am going to Tarczyn.ﬂ He was 

afraid that she's going actually next door. But we 
went out from her right away and my father 
begged her not to say anything and, "Oh, of cour
se, not.ﬂ And we went into the right door 
already. We came into the right door, but this was nervous and heartbreaking. This couple 

were there. My father's partner, Mr. Leshno,was there already too and they took us right 
away in the attic and then these people send out...they were poor people. The daughter which 
was in her 20s went out and bought food for us. We  didn't have nothing to eat. And, "Fine. 

We 'r e supposed to be there.ﬂ This was Saturday night and Sunday overnight. In the mi ddle 
of the night, the voice says, "Everything is ready. Who is going first? "  They supposed to 
take us. It was 34 kilome ters to Tarczyn. And we wanted not go to Tarczyn, but to the sides 

of Tarczyn, to...through the forest to go to the village. And they don't want him to know it, so 
they ma ked up that he will take us, the six of us. No. Leshno's son wasn't  anymore with us. 
He left before with this guy. We  were four...five. Uh...So this lady said, "She and her 

husband would go separate, and I should go with my father and this Mr. Leshno.ﬂ She 
looked like an Irish woma n and her husband          
 but she didn't want to go with us. So... but 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114

we were supposed to go to the same  place. We  me t there. Fine. So this guy took us, a young 
son from these people. They got paid. How much I don't know. And with the horses, with the 
Wa gen and we was like sitting like poor people, and they took us. And we went a few 
kilome ters, some body jumped out...it was still night, and Jews              
. Two Polish me n. 
They ma ked up with these people, you know. We  were sold out. "Give me  your money. Give 
me  a few jewels, what you have. Otherwise, we'r e going to take you to the Germans.ﬂ My 
father didn't know them. The guy didn't know them. I for sure not, but he start to shiver, this 

boy who took us...the son of this. Probably he knew what...who it is. Maybe the girl's 
boyfriend or whoever. We  never find out. So th
ey start from our, let's say, 5,000 slotas, but 
who had the money?  So between my father and Leshno they gave him a thousand or fifteen 
hundred slotas, which was a lot of money for us and they let us go. So I had no saying in it. I 
was a little girl. So only my father and Leshno said, "You can go back. We  don't need you 
anymore.ﬂ We were afraid more people like this will jump out and he could give us out to 

the German. So we start to walk on the sideways (clearing throat again) til... We didn't have 
any much money, Polish money we didn't have any more. So we walked. We  came to a 
small...uh...village and Mr. Leshno said to my father, "We're going into Saboski
.ﬂ His name  
was Saboski, a farmer, who was also dealing with my father, bought, you know, come  to 
the...to the mill, borrowed sometimes money (clearing throat). So we came in. He right away 
like he said a prayer. Who am I seeing and he was afraid, but fine, it's Sunday night so the 

children are out, dancing or anyplace else, but he just put a poor man into the barn so he tell 
him to go out. He will give him a few slotas so he will go and look for another place and 
we'll...he will let us in just to rest in peace for a couple of hours. In the meantime my father 

sold him a piece of gold, you know, a coin and he sold...Mr. Leshno
 coin so he has Polish 
money to buy some thing. And we had a good meal. Milk and bread, and they were talking a 
little bit. But to hold us, he wasn't . He didn't need us. He was rich, a rich fa rmer. He didn't 
want us. Where we going?  We had a place but he is still the destination. So we went into the 

forest. We still had to make like 20 something kilometers and we went in the daylight. We 
didn't want to walk because you could always see some body so we stood mostly in the 
forest. About 5 o'clock in the morning we went into a farmer. We  didn't where we'r e going 

in, but me and Mr. Leshno...my father couldn't go and Mr. Leshno spoke a little better this 
Polish and he knew more in this town..not town, village..people. My father didn't know so 
ma ny there. So we went in and there wasn't  there a guy, the owner from the farm, but a 

worker. And he said, "Out, you Jews, you go. What you doing here?  You're going to shot. 
Out from here.ﬂ So Mr. Leshno says to him, "Can I speak with the owner? "  "No, he's still 
sleeping. His wife is sleeping. Out from here. 
If not, the Germans are going to be here any 
mi nute.ﬂ So we were afraid. So we start to walk again til we came like 5, 6 kilometers fr om 
the place where we want to go in, but we cannot go in the daytime and we have to wait for 
the night. So we staying in this forest and my father says, "I know this forest very well, and I 

know the ma nager from the forest and you stay here with Leshno and I go by myself.ﬂ So I 
didn't agree. I said, "You'll never find us.ﬂ Yes, he went with Leshno into this ma nager and 
he was very much afraid this ma nager when he saw them, but his conscious didn't let him. 

Yablonski
 was his name , and he took them in and he give them food and he wanted to see 
me  and my father was very happy that he wants to go along but he didn't reme mber where he 
left me. And I was sitting under a tree like this and all of a sudden a little deer comes around 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
18 
 
me, smells me...smells me and I said, "My God. Is this an angel from my mother? "   I 
was...you know, it's like a dream. And, well, he said, "Wherever you go"...he didn't know 
where we'r e going..."Good luck to you. I cannot stay with you.ﬂ And by the nighttime we 
went to this place. We came to this place. This woman with the husband were there already. 

We  came to a place to a German woma n. She wasn't ...she was born in Poland, that 
Volksdeutsche, and she has a Polish husband and for the money, she takes us in. I actually 
don't know exactly the money how ma ny she got. I know they giving away a lot of 

gold...uh...but she also will have monthly money. When we receive the money from the 
partner, from the Christian partner, and a lot of lot promises from my father and him. Okay?  
So right away, they have food and the bunker is ma de. We  going in through the stables to a 

hole and mi ddle is a pole. You cannot sit. You have to like this. When you lie it just like 
sardines. Uh...We been six people already. Two days later my cousin came. I was afraid to 
say that I said to him. I didn't tell my father til he came..that I told him the place, and we took 

him in to, so we have seven people already, like sardines. And it wasn't  bad. You survive. 
And what'a  going to be nobody knew. But we'r e in a good place because she was German 
you know. But what we didn't know til the last mi nute when it happened that her husband 

belonged to...what you call...organization against the German, but they were against the Jews 
too. What's the difference?  But he wasn't  okay. Then they were pressing him that he 
should...uh...to be German to take care her nationality, and he didn't want it. So we'r e staying 

there and a cousin of mi ne, second cousin came  to stay next building. This was in the village, 
you know, like...uh...farme r's house. She came to stay also by our farmer. They took her in 
because they know the family and my father and Leshno
 went in the night time so both the 
farmers know from each other. So they went. Some times she ma ked a better me al so she 
gave some thing to eat, you know. And it was good this way. We  stood there for a nice 
couple of months til this couple said they'r e going to another place. They afraid to be 

together with us because we are too ma ny. So they went to another place. We knew it...the 
place. And the sent the brother of his brother came to live with us...to live in this (laughter) 
beautiful surroundings. In the evening a lot of times this...they came that we could come 

in...in the house. So we came in. We  had the water what she cooked for us with two potatoes 
and that's how we lived. It was like in this time before the holidays. And my father had a 
letter from a...from an estate. This called like a big farmer a           
 that he owes my father 
this and this money because my father bought from him were when he supposed...from the 
fields he brought already the...the...the corn already from him. The choice is by God all will 
be alot or will be small, but he make a deal with him...let's say it will be a 100         
 or ma ybe 
200, so I pay you for 170 or I pay you for 150. And this was the bill and my father paid in 
advance. So these        
 from this estate had paid everything and we...this was a paper, and I 
was carrying this paper with me  to go with this German woma n...he should give us some  

flour so she could ma ke bread for herself, for us, and also because my father was religious. 
We all been. We didn't want to eat bread for Passover. So she agreed that she will, with our 

help, will help make Matzahs for us. I went with her to this...uh...man til he took me in. He 
sat with me . He saw the paper. He said I should come  another day. And I said, "Frankly, I 
wouldn't like to come another day because I am taking my life in my hands like this. This is 

some kilometers to go.ﬂ And in this same talking I want him to kow that I didn't come along, 
that I come  with a Christian woma n. I was fraid to say German woman because he could kill 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
19 
 
me  and, you know, this way he has witnesses that some body is dead, that I was told my 
father... told me  what to say. And I told him everything. He didn't give me  nothing this time. 
So we appealed to the people in Tarczyn...to the mill people, and they give us flour. 50 
pounds. And 2 nights before the Passover, I, my father. this cousin from the other guy, she 

came in to us and he told us and we stood and she ma ked the oven. She had a oven in her 
house and we ma ke the ma tzahs for Passover. We  didn't have ma ny because they liked them 
better than us, this German with her children and her husband, but we didn't need anything 

else and we begged her...to my father didn't take any part in it. When she boils the potatoes, 
just right potatoes, no fat, no Schmalz, you know, because sometimes they put pork, little bit, 
and also from beets (ph) she should have ma ke Wurst for us, so that what this. And in the 

night time another few Jews came from other places. They know we'r e here. And in the 
bunker everybody was crying. We didn't have a seder, and my father make the seder. Milk 
and water was our wine. Not much, but everybody could get a drop. And this Mr. Pavlock
 
was his name , this German's husband...he was on top to see if nobody is around because it 
was a little higher the emotions than actually it should have been. Everybody was crying and 
praying to God for a mi racle, but we had a seder. And everybody went home with a piece of 

ma tzah to celebrate the second night too. And from then on, my name  was Ceshick
 (ph). Not 
Cywia, but Ceshick
 (ph). Okay?  Everybody went back home. And it was peaceful. From 
sometimes in the day, she said I should come into the house. It's quiet. I should watch the 
baby. She's going out in the fields. One day she was still home and I was called in. She says 
to me ...this German, "I left the little dog outside, so if you know he's barking you should run 

in the oven.ﬂ So I heard barking this little dog and I said...I was peeling potatoes and 
watching the baby also. I was glad to be home, not to sit there. (Sigh)  I said...all of a sudden 
she heard voices. Right?  So she ran out, and I ran in the oven. And this little dog saved my 

life. The Germans came in and they asked about her husband, and they start to speak to her 
German and I heard every word...two soldiers         
. And they asked for her husband. If she 
was very much tortured that her husband should take the nationality...the German 

nationality. Okay?  So thank God, they left and I was saved. From then on I was afraid to 
come. I was always there. One day it was really something. I had to use the bathrooms. I had 

probably a loose stomach. I went in top and I didn't know that some body inside from the 
bunker, the brother from this guy went upstairs already. So I went. It wasn't  a toilet or 
anything. I released myself, and I want to go out...down. I see the doors are open and two 

me n came with a woma n in. Uh huh. is here. A Jewish girl is here. So they spotted him to. 
So I said...it was a hole here and I came to hide here. You understand?  Not that we'r e hiding 
here. And please don't kill me . Let me  run away. So he said, "Hush. Hush.ﬂ So I and this guy 

start to run. We  run. We  didn't want to say what, you know... But we had also learned that 
whenever we going out to this place, you have to cover it back with straw, with all the dirt, 
which I did which was good. And they were looking for this ma n, for Pavlack
. Uh...We were 
running, we both of us, and we came to a place, a farmer. He knewed everybody. So we said 
that we very hungry, she should let us in. A ve
ry old woma n from a fry pan she must have 
ready for a dog...potatoes, you know, from who...whoever left them and she pulled red 
borscht on it and she put milk on it and water... like for a dog probably, and she brought us 
this for us. It was in heaven. We both start to eat. I don't even remember if it was a spoon 
(laughter) and we stood there til in the night time. In the night time we went back to the place 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
20 
 
which was, Thank God, that we survived the day. A few days later the me n came in and he 
said during the day...it was on a Monday...and the ma n said, "I am sorry, but you must leave. 
I heard in town that I have Jews. And any day they could come . So I don't want any...you 
know, anything to happen to you. So please leave. And when it's quiet you could come  

back.ﬂ This guy was sick. He was a nice ma n. What was the problem?  She got drunk, and 
she said in the...in the town there in the 
village...Sunday, Saturday, "You will see how rich I 
will get when the war is end.ﬂ Nobody knew it but when the war is end she will be a German 

because she will get rich...or she have Jews. They speculate. They didn't know it. So we have 
to run away. So my father says,          
 Where to go?  We  have nobody.ﬂ So this is like 11, 12 
o'clock in the bright day in winter. Go to th
e forest. Mr. Leshno and his son, right way they 
go to this...they were a little relatives very distant with this couple, so they'r e going to this 
couple. So my father said, "Who cares. I am going too.ﬂ We  go, but we can't  go together. So 

they went separate in us. As we going through the forest...everything through the forest, and 
we left everything here what we possessed. I had my mother's dresses which some times my 
father took in the night time a dress and went out to another farm and sold the dress or 

bought a bottle of milk for it or this, but she took control of everything, this German woman. 
I also had beads, under beads
. My father had this...he bought this for my mother as a 
souvenir, a gift, and since I took mi ne mother's knapsack...everything... 
 
Q: Knapsack. 
 
A: Knapsack. So I had this there too. So she took this too...this German woman until she 
returned after the war to me. Not all of them, but a few and I still have them and cherish 

them very much. So we came to this forest, me  and my father, and my father was very much 
afraid that some body finds me  I should be raped. I didn't know nothing about life. It wasn't  

time to..to tell me , you know. And all of a sudden he sees this ma n. He says, "I know you.ﬂ 
A christian person. You...this and this name. At the moment I don't remember, but I did 
remember his name. Maybe you could take my daughter in. She's a young girl. I will stay in 

the forest, but take my daughter in. He said, "Karma ska
, I would take you too, but they 
workers working by me . They ma king oil, black oil from         
. I don't know this word. I 
never saw it. It's like...uh...a flower, you know, by the Poles. So I really can't take you, but I 
advise you should stay away from here because this day the German confiscate pork, cows, 
anything what's alive and dead, they confiscate...confiscate from the farmers. So, Thank 

God, we'r e together again, me  and my father, because he saw that he's not a dangerous ma n 
so we got together again. And I said, "Dad, maybe we'll stay in the forest til the night and we 
go.ﬂ He said, "No, if the Germans come  they could come  to the forest too.ﬂ So we went to 

these people. There was a lady with two beautiful daughters, not too rich, and she was really 
holding this couple to survive. And these two people came also Leshno with her son and 
here we are also. We  weren't too happy at all. My father was very famous in the town. She 

liked to speak to him and everything but she doesn't  want to hold so ma ny people, and it's not 
healthy also. So we stood a little bit and then was very late and she said, "Not right away in 
the ice"...to this couple or maybe just this
 couple said...didn't say anything...we speculate 
only. "We will go. If God give us our life"...I mean I didn't say anything because I still was 
looking up to my father. To me  he was God. And we survived so much, and everything what 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
21 
 
he said it came out the right way so what can I say?  (Sigh)  So we went out with this that 
we'r e going back to this place..we have no...to this German woma n, first to have the 
possession there. Second, we'll stay there. So...but we were hungry. So I went into a store in 
the...by the forest. I knew the person. He built in Tarczyn in mi ne house...in our house, an 

oven from tiles, you know, so I asked my father, "Shall I say who I am?"  And he said, "If he 
recognize you, fine. But don't say anything? "  My  father was standing on the outside. So I 
went in and I asked, "Could you please sell me  a bread, a half kilo of bread. I'm very 

hungry.ﬂ He said, "I know who you are and would I have bread I would sell you. But it's too 
late and I don't have it. Maybe when you come another time.ﬂ Okay. So I went out and I said 
this to my father and we had to make like another 3, 4 miles...kilometers to this place where 

we been. So here we come  in, it was like...I would say 7, 8 o'clock in the night, but it was 
dark, very dark already by the forest still, and this German woman...this where we lived 
standing and washing already my mother's nice things. I said, "Why're you doing this? "   And 

also the shirts from my father and from Mr. Leshno...what ever we had. She grabbed 
every...cleaned up the bunker and she's washing. "Oh, when it gets dry, you will get it back.ﬂ 
We never get it back. We had nothing anymore, and I start to ask for shoes from my mother's 

what I had. I had...from...in the knapsack and for the beads. "Oh, what do you need it. What 
do you need it.ﬂ Okay. "Can we stay.ﬂ She said, "I prefer this place should be a little clean at 
least for a few days.ﬂ She was right. But toni
ght you have to stay. Otherwise ... where would 
you go?  So I went in back with my father to this bunker and we stayed there. And the same  
night Leshno
 came with his son, so we back four people there. My cousin went away, and 
we didn't see him for a couple of days and he didn't know what the changes were here. (Sigh) 

 So we stood, but they weren't happy with us, and we knew any day some thing will happen. 
(Sigh)  So we knew from one place where it's hiding a ma n, a acquaintance Mr. Leshno. He 

lost the whole family, but to take out a girl, for a wife, you know, to live with her and she has 
really the looks from a Christian with a brot
her. So we decide...they decide we going to 
them. But this is so far away. Like this is in the east and this is in the west. So the night is 
big. So we start to walk. And we came there, and they agreed to hold us. It was no parents 
there. Just a young boy, maybe 18, 19 years and small children. A sister was maybe 16, little 
boy 10 but he walks like he was 25, this little boy. I just drink something. If I could or not, 

but I can't  talk. So they agreed to hold us. So this couple, this man went in another place...but 
the same  farmer boy, he went to live in an attic from the house, and we took over his bunker, 
but for the day time he came to stay with us because with us was more people. They played 

cards. They talked. So we stayed together. 
(Sigh)  How long...maybe 2 months, 3 months 
probably. Anyway we heard the news from 
around what happened. One nice day we heard 

that the place by these German people... the Gestapo came they couldn't live without Jews, 

so they took in a family with two children and the Gestapo killed her husband, not with a 
shot, but like with a butt, not because he holds Jews. Because he was against to take the 
citizens as a German. They would have killed her too but she was pregnant at the time. So 

they let her live and as they were looking...I don't know, ma ybe for Jews, they find the two 
Jews...the family. The little boy escaped. Two little boys were...the kids escaped. The parents 
were killed. That's...I knew them. They were alsofrom mi ne town. It was a sister from this 

couple what I went out together from the ghetto, from the Warsaw ghetto. And the time we 
heard also that the liquidate the ghetto and that was the time when my cousin came and we

had...we saw in the morning even the me n brought us in burned pieces of paper from the 
ghetto when the ghetto was burning, like from seders or from Torahs. Who knows what it 
was. Probably just books. You know. The wind brought it back, and the smell was also... 
Okay. So we were living there. (Sigh)  Nothing comfort. Hungry. But the best we could do, 

we'r e doing only to survive. One night...

Q: Okay. You can go ahead now. 
 
A: Okay. We  stayed with this family in Pomyonka
. That's how they call this place. And there 
was no father, just a boy, a sister and...uh...two or
 three more children, and we were staying 
in this bunker one beautiful night...mustly we are people on the night, not on the day, so they 
brought us in the night. The first we couldspeak clearly. As we were sleeping, Poles 

came...young boys. Matter of fact, I recognized one who borrowed my homework from 
school, and he said, "Give me  your money. You 
rich people. Give me  your gold. GIve me  
everything.ﬂ I said, "         
, you took books from me . How was it you never wanted to ma ke 
copy from me , and you're going to take my books.ﬂ He slapped me  and he pulled my boots 
off. Okay?  He took away from my father this pi
cture, all the pictures. A night or two before I 
had a dream from my mother and she said, "Mydear child, if you want to save your pictures, 
ma ybe you could ma ke a little...uh...bag on your neck and this way you will save the 
pictures.ﬂ And I mentioned this to my cousin, and she said, "Why not?  I help you, and let's 
make it.ﬂ We didn't have any material so she took off her bra and in the bra was a double 

lining so she took the lining and make for me a...a little bag, and I put in all these pictures, 
and the pictures thanks to this you have it now. And the pictures survived. My father had a 
lot of pictures from his family from his fath
er, from his mother. He was an orphan when he 
was 9, 10 years old, so he had...still had pictures from his mother who died when she was 29 
years old. And they all take the pictures. Don't ask me why...what they need the pictures, but 
they took it. But the sad story was that the Poles didn't come along. They come with a Jewish 

boy. The Jewish boy was from our town. His name  was     
. And we saw him. He looked like 
a Pole, and ma ybe he saved his life by giving out us to them. Money...they...we didn't have 
money. If we had it, we had only in, you know, what we had hid in hiding, sewn in the 
garment what we had. And they took us to the room, together with this people, already with 

this couple, this man and this girl who took out from the attic, and they put us in a line and 
when my father...uh...saw this and they took away already his pictures, he run. He has...he 
had only his slacks and a jacket, and he had 
his pyjama under and he run. And from Leshno
 
from my father's partner, they took the boots also. In the boots was a gold piece, so he was 
barefoot. And they took my boots so I start to ask and beg in the room, "Please give...take 
everything, but I know you. We  grow up together
. I went with your sister to school. Why 
you taking my boots?  We 'r e fighting for our life. Please.ﬂ And I was crying. So one give me  
a slap in the face, and I fell to the ground. Afterthe war, I took care of him. That's the whole 
family came to Lodz to me  to beg to me  he should be released from prison. Through Russian 

soldiers and through a Pole I got to him. What's with him, I don't know, but the story was 
told. Not from me  but from this Pole who was a friend. He was a Senator before the war. 
Anyway we ran out. Then they left. When they left, the guy didn't want to hold us. It's no use 

to hold us. RIght?  So...and it was raining. It was early morning, like 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock. So I 
cannot walk in the...in the forest because it was after the...how you call this?  When they take 
from...up the...the... I forgotten?  When the farmers take off from the...from the ... I need this 

word.

Q: Plowing or the... 
 
A: Plowing...no they didn't take up the plowing. The harvest! You know when I get nervous I 
(laughter) I lose the... the harvest. It was the harvest...after the harvest, so you know the 
straw what they took off it went...it goes in your legs. I couldn't walk. But still they had the 
straw staying to get dry so me  and my cousin went into...to like on the straw like you saw in 

a picture. 
 
Q: Haystack. 
 
A: The haystack. So we went in but we couldn't 
get in to..and here we have a whole day to get 
through with this. And my cousin also went into one, but he was by himself and he start to 
talk to us, what we doing next and where are 
we going?  It start to rain and it was windy, and 
all of a sudden one mi nute it fall apart, the straw and we staying like this. No people 
surrounding. Nobody was there. So we decide we had nothing to lose. We  start to walk. 
Where are we going?  We 'r e going to a forest. But we had this ma ked up with my father. 
Only thing what happened we meet but this Senator,               
. He was a friend of ours. My 
father had hidden this stuff what he always sold for us...a dress, a garment, some thing...a 
piece of furniture, we should be able to live. So by him is the best part to live. His brother 
was the one who brought into the Wa rsaw ghetto some times money and she was the one 

from the mill what she got the pension and brought for us also. Very confident people. He 
was the one who brought to trial this guy who took my boots. Okay. So we supposed to meet 
by him, which in the night time we met there. We came to him. He said, "You go out here 

and here. You'll find your father.ﬂ So my father had already boots. Through the day, 
Lesh...my father had the boots, but Leshno
 had boots and had some thing to eat, so my father 
said, "We have no place, but let's go and look for some body also from the town. He 

mentioned once that he could have a place for us
.ﬂ This was already the night. So we went 
and we...we got this man. It was like oasis, with little trees, like a forest, and all of us went in 
there and my father said, "We will probably go to this place.ﬂ But he went, this guy went. He 
said he's a relative...I don't know exactly to my father....to this and this guy           
 to ask him 
if he wants to ma ke money so we could be by hi
m. So during the day we went in this oasis. 
We had nothing to eat, just what we'd brought up, but at least we were been all together. 
Leshno
's son ran away so he went to another place, to another village where also there were 
Jews, and I and my cousin and my father and Leshno
 and the cousin...the lady was in this 
oasis and this guy went to ask this guy. He came back with good news, that they want to take 
us, and set the amount of money and the gained the promises after...after...after. We went 
into this place. There was two very old people, and...uh...a bachelor's son and a younger son 

and a widower, a son-in-law. But the son-in-law was better than all of them. His wife died 
and he rema ined in the village, and he was working for the German by...uh...milk, but 
the...the farmers brought him milk there and he ma ke            
...uh...uh...sour cream and he 
shoveled this to the German. So a few dollars, for a few slotas
 he sometimes brought us a 
bottle of milk which it wasn't  already milk, but was sour, but it was good for us. Okay. So we 
were living on this and we were very comfortable. At night time they let us in inside and we 
had not a meal, but fine. So we took our cousin also, the very intelligent boy and there he got 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
25 
 
very sick, my cousin. And he was afraid to go to the doctor, and he start...because he knew 
so much, he start to cure himself, and he died there. And now like          
 will have his           
and after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us. My father did 
a very much, a lot a lot, but we were afraid to start it, so he remains still his bones there, in 
his field. We  stood there and this old lady went  occasionally to town and she brought bread 

and she baked bread. And we give them...my father give them money, and they live a 
little...a life a little more comfortable because they were very, very poor. And we had a nice 
place by them. And also the same  pattern...to go in, I have pictures here how we went into 

this bunker, how ma ny people we were there and nobody knew it. And this guy also stood 
with us. We  even like paid for him too. And one beautiful day...uh...they came  to the town, 
and they said that the German come  to the town and they going to occupy you, you, you...I 

mean the farmers' places, and we had to go. We  had to leave. We  had to leave. This was 
winter, and it was very, very cold. A storm in Poland and we are not dressed. I don't still 
have boots. I don't have nothing what to wear. (Sigh)  So what do I have to lose. I went to 

town. And I knocked on the door for my neighbor. Her husband worked us...worked in our 
mill and I said... she has no children. He used to like me very much because he said I said I 
was used to sing. When I went to school late                 
 and I said, "I don't have boots.ﬂ I put 
down the latest hiding and they like 2, 3 sizes smaller and I came and please...here...when 
you get the money from       
 from the mill, please buy me  a pair of boots and a coat.ﬂ So she 
went down, and she bought me  shoes, and she bought me ...high shoes, not boots, but high 

shoes, and she bought me  a coat, and she gave me a good meal to eat, and I ma ked up with 
the woma n what she took me  to town and she went shopping to me  and I survived. I came 

to...to the hiding place back with a few dollars, with bread. That's how I got the shoes for me . 
And we were there. Okay. And she always borrowed my shoes...the lady, the old lady. It was 
three sizes big. One day she said she wouldn't give me back but I didn't need it, I don't walk 

anymore. But when I...when we suppose to leave, she didn't give me  my shoes. She give me  
her shoes. And they still were too small. Where do we go? We have no place where to go. So 
we know from this place where the Jews are, by this old lady. We  go to her. So we came 

there. And the Jews they were hiding there, didn't let us in. They said they want to live. Too 
ma ny Jews cannot be here. It's very dangerous. But me  and my cousin are young girls, they 
would take in. My father and Leshno
 they don't want to take in. Okay. But the woma n 
wanted to take in my father. She didn't care. This is the picture what I showed you and which 
I brought. So I said, "If not my father, I don't want to go either.ﬂ So I, my father, Leshno
, my 
cousin, and Leshno
's son went back to this place, to the oasis, to the forest, in the mi ddle. 
This was a Sunday. And we sitting, lying like this, not sitting, but from the     
 from the 
forest. All of a sudden we hear from the town...from the village, boys are playing cards____, 

you know, and we are like mouses. Quiet. All of a sudden, bang, bang, bang. We  heard a 
shooting. I saw the Germans. I saw the police, the Polish police. I picked my head up and the 

worse part what it was, they had white cheese, like farmer cheese, apiece and a boy who I 
know it, had a whole farmer cheese. He was so happy. He went out. He was killed. So I said 
because we have farmer cheese, we'r e going to be killed. So my father said, "Don't pick up 

your head. Just lay down.ﬂ So I was lying after him. I don't know what ma ke me  do, but I 
picked up my head and I saw the bayonet...the... the...the...from the German and from the 
Polish...uh... policeman. They were looking...and for the...I can't  reme mber exactly how the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
26 
 
Polish organization                           
. They were looking for this organization because they 
were an organization also against the German, but also against the Jews. Okay. So this 
shooting what we heard...we been 7, 8 people. The players were also       
. They were shot 
from this Polish police and from the German. We  survived thanks to them because they shot 

them they head them off of us. But we saw them. My father, I me an, the rest of the people, 
everybody saw them. They didn't see us, but we could see them. Not the faces exactly, but 

they have bodies. Okay. So in the night time we said, "We can't  stay here. We cannot stay 
here. We  have to run again.ﬂ So a delegation went to this woma n that she took...has to take 
us in. So she took us in. Okay?  When she took us in, this Jewish people what they were 

hiding there, went away from her because the whole town know that she has Jews. They 
were so hungry that they was eating leaves from...from like         
, you know, spinach, from 
the...from the farm. They didn't have nothing to eat. And they give us some  money, some  

promises. We  lived on promises, which we...we...thank God we rema ined. The world was 
good. They all had paid for it. And this woma n took us out...took us in. Wa s very, very cold 

already, and was a storm, and it was near like to the liberation already. So in the night time in 
the storm, we didn't had meat and my father and...uh...Leshno
 went, but we have to go in for 
the towns they ma ked holes so we had to go like two..two flopped down and then to come  

out. Otherwise, there was no way to get through to this...uh..village. So we went in. Fine. But 
we couldn't get up. So my father with a cane...he was thin and very, you know, so he went up 

and then he start to slip me up. So I lost this bread what I had with me. I just had in my 
pocket...from the coat pocket...uh...I think I had...uh... some thing...I don't know what I had. It 
doesn't  matter. I had something, a biscuit maybe. And...uh...he started to take Leshno
 up. He 
wasn't  heavy, but he was 6 foot, ma ybe more ev
en. Very hardly, he was begging, "I want to 
die here. Please, you go. You live. Go. Go. Go.ﬂ My father says, "No. You take it. You fell 

one time. You fell two times because there's the water, and there's the snow inside. We came 

up. But now how do you go?  If you go into snow, you ma ke a lot of steps so the steps will 
lead to her. Right?  So we went. Anyway we 
came there, and there we staying. Staying there 
was a hard life there too. Til these the other Jews left. They had a hard time with them. Why?  
Because it was too ma ny of us in one place. She couldn't cook. She didn't had where to eat. 
She had a pot with a hole because it was dripping out if she put water in. They were very 
poor. Primitive. Very primitive. (Sigh)  So one beautiful day, we heard screaming. The 

police there. "Hey, Lady, where do you have the Jews? "   She said, "What Jews? "   So one 
policeman...I knew him..I had...I recognized the voice. He was    
 by father plenty in the 
good days. Malechewski (ph) was his name. With his son I went to school too. Was a small 

town. Everybody want know each other. Tarcyzn was very small. So he slapped the girl. She 
was 10 years old. "You. Tell me  where the Jews are.ﬂ She said, "We don't have Jews.ﬂ So the 

little boy who was 8 years old heard that she denies, so he denied too. They took away our 
stuff, a few pieces of silver, you know, what th
is woma n had taken from us. My father or 
Leshno
 give it to her, but this shouldn't be in first place this place because she hasn't  got a pot 
or nothing to eat, and here she has silver cup what you ma ke Kiddush on it you know. And 

we had them to sell...to get some  money or bread for it. Okay. When they left, these Jews left 
us too and we'r e by her hiding and hiding. Then
 her daughter came. A married daughter. Her 
husband was a terrible anti-Semite. And they discovered us. Money. Good words. We  
talked. We  had nothing to lose. Where do you go?  And we know it's soon it's going to be 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
27 
 
over because the American planes were on our heads. We saw it already in the night time 
when we went out from bunker we could see.We  prayed for this mome nt. Right?  So we 
stood there. No other returning. And one night people came. We  were in bunker. By her it 
was more in home because it was a cellar, and they were talking Russian and this was the 

partisans and they took the older boy away, and this week was a terrific day because the boy 
came from church. They were very religious people, the Christian people. So he went to 
church and the Priest gave a sermon that he should help people but many times he came 

home and he said, "Hey, Maw. Maybe we should throw out these Jews? "    The priests said 
that we shouldn't hold Jews or partisans because they will kills us. We had already news that 
they took two Jewish girls for five pounds of sugar to the Germans and they escaped. And 

this was my father's cousins. I include the pictures here...them. They survived the war. They 
are not living anymore. They lived in Israel. They left a nice family, but they don't live there 
anymore. Natural death. And so we were afraid. Right?  So the church didn't work for the 

Jews. That's for real. The anti-Semitism was terrible. If a neighbor knocked the door, they 
knew that this neighbor has Jews you couldn't stay another day. Even by the people what 
they took from you the money and they very nice and they wait we should be liberate so they 

will get rich, even they were anti-Semite. Why I don't know. I would never know. I am not a 
prejudice person. By me  everybody's good and all the flowers are the same . One is yellow, 
one is white and red. So am I. One...a person's a humanbeing and that's it. But the church had 

a lot to do with anti-Semitism. So this boy came home and he wasn't  in a good mood, and in 
the night time during the night, this partisans came and they lie down on the floor under the 
opening from the...how we are afraid, and they talking Russians. I don't understand 

their...now I understand Russian. But my father understood. So he bent over like this to me 
and hold my arms like this I shouldn't cough. I shouldn't do anything. Thank God. We were 
healthy in there. And everybody quiet til it got light, so he took him with his horse to some 

destination. I don't know where. Three days later he came running...the same  boy. Jew. Jude. 
Get out. Your'r e free. So we were like...we didn't want to go out. We  were like paralyzed. 
And this same  day we got flour for this woma n and she baked bread. Each bread was like a 

table round. So my father...he didn't see anything, but he touched the big bread and he's 
running. And here the front is going. And 
this was the...the...great..., you know,the 
holes...where for the tanks. And the stopped the whole army, the Russian army, and he 
screams in Russian...he's Jewish and he's liberated and he is kissing this cop, this Russian, 
and the whole army stopped. And he's explaining and he catched this    
 boy Ganick. 
His 
name  is Ganick Vitishinski
. I have pictures include from his mother. This is my ma n. By him 
we survived and I am going to do everything from him, and we are free. And he's telling 

him, so the captain says...major captain...uh...he's telling that his wife and his sons got killed 
from Germans, so he said, "So's the whole world. Everybody's killed a little. I mean he 

meant Jews because he came from Russia through with the front, and he know what is going 
on. Okay?  So and we were afraid that ma ybe it's not so. Maybe this will be German. But we 
saw the German running...Germa n soldiers running, and got killed also from...from this 

soldiers...from the Russian. And they took the bread and my father came back to..to us, and 
this night we didn't sit anymore in bunker. But from another town,            
, there was also a 
very rich persons with an estate. He also...Leskinski
         
 in Polish is the name . He came...he 
heard this Kamalski
, my father and Leshno
 is here so he came to visit. And they sat and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
28 
 
kissed, but a few days before when my father sent this lady to say that Kama lski
 is around 
and occasion I see him, give him something to eat or give him a few dollars, Polish slotas, 
that's not.... They were afraid already for communism you know. So he sat a whole night and 
speak to them and in the morning we are liberated. So everybody from us, myself, my father 

and my cousin, Leshno
 we went to town. By this time my cousin, which was my father's 
second wife, rema ined in the place by this people what we had to go away because the 
Germans really came to them. They occupied all the stables. But she looked a little 
like...uh...a Polish girl so she stood behind and she didn't want...she didn't care already for 

life. You know, she was very depressed also. She was older than me  naturally. So...uh...we 
me t her too as we went...continue. I didn't know. I didn't know much that my father and her 
was a little roma nce. And Leshno
 also would like to marry her. It was like a competition a 
little. But...uh...I think my...she married my father for mostly the promise was to my father. 
She was never ma rried, and she was a true family...she was a far cousin to me . Okay. So 
when we were liberated, my father ma rried her. And they had a very happy life, and I loved 

her very much. And she gave me a brother and a sister which I adore and I love them. My 
brother was born in Poland and my sister was born Israel and very tight family. She died 
when she was 46 years old. Naturally, she had a heart failure...failure so she died. Okay?  

And my father died in '77. He was 77 years old. He lived in Israel and when she died he...he 
like he died too. But we insist that he should pick up his life. He has small children. My 
brother was 14 years old. My sister was 6...e
xcuse me ...12 years old. She was born when my 
brother was 6 years old. And with letters...uh...I begged him he should rema rry and he did 
rema rry and he wasn't  happy. And I think from unhappiness he died. Okay?   
 
Q: Thank you. We  have to stop at this point. 
 
A: Okay. We  left Paris. And we. Shall we continue?  
 
Q: I mean that's all the time we have on this tape. Linda said we had to stop. Thank you very 
much. 
 
A: I would like to add that I went to Paris...in Lodz. 
 
Q: She said to do it in two sentences. Tell her what you need to tell about Lodz. 
 
A: I want to say I was liberated...we were liberate
d. I want to add that we were liberated. I was 
in the mi ddle.  
 
Q: Okay. Go ahead. 
 
A: I was liberated. Excuse me . I was liberated in January...in January 16, 1945. We went to 
Tarczyn. I went back to mi ne house. It was very hard for us. We couldn't stay in Tarczyn 

because in the mi ddle of the night, as much as the Poles loved us, they throw stones on us 
and they said the Jews should be killed and not stay with them anymore. So we went to live 

in Lodz. And we lived in Lodz til I me t my husband and we went to Paris in 1947. I lived in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0114 
29 
 
Paris 6 years, happy years, and then when the war start with...uh...Viet Nam...uh...we wanted 
to go to America because I didn't want to live another war. So we went to America and we 
ma ked our life. I have two daughters, Francis and Linda. They'r e both ma rried, both have 
two children. Francis has a boy and a girl, and Linda has two girls, and they'r e very good 

children and they remember they belong to the second generation. They know what their 
parents lived through. That's mi ne life. I dreamed a lot about it, and many nights I would like 
to dream or to wake up to see it, but I survived. Thank God. 
 
Q: Thank you very much. 
 
A: Thankyou.
