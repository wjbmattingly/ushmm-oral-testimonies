Q: –and we™re with Emilie Szekely in her home 
in Lexington, Kentucky.  And my na me  is Arwen 
Donahue and we™re going to be conducting an 
interview today about– well, we™ll see how far 
we get.  We ™ r e going to start with
 the birth and mo ve on from ther
e.  And I just wanted to note 
for those who are listening to this tape, that 
there was an interview done with Mrs. Szekely by 
the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation in 1996 and we
 ma y be repeating some  things that were 

discussed in that interview, but 
there ma y be some things that we
re discussed in that interview 
that we won™t talk about today.  So, Mrs. S
zekely, why don™t we start with you telling me  your 
name  at birth and your date of
 birth and where you were born? 
 

A: I was born in Hungary, Budapest, in
 1920, 16th of February, in Budapest. 
 

Q: And your name  at birth? 

 

A: Klugma n. 

 

Q: Klugma n. 

 

A: Klugma n. 

 

Q: K L U G M A N?  
 
A: Yeah, and in Russia they are writing, my cousin
 is Klegma n, because ﬁuﬂ in Russia is ﬁeﬂ.  So 
he™s writing a ﬁuﬂ, but he™s calling hims elf 
Klegman.  But it is Klugman.  Klugman, you know 
what this means in German? 
 

Q: No. 

 

A: German, 
Klug
 is ﬁsma rtﬂ, ma n.  [La ughing]  That™s th
e name.  He was a smart man.  I showed 
you their pictures.  No?    
 

Q:  Yeah. 

 

A:  My parents™ pictures. 

 

Q: Now was your father, you me nti
oned in the other interview that 
your father was Russian.  Did he 
have– of German extraction?   Or, what was his– 
 

A: The name is Klugman fr om Russia and there are 
a lot of Klugma ns there.  So I don™t know how 
it came, where it, how, but he was born in Kie
v.  And his fa mily was 
in Ki ev until the First 
World Wa r– Second World Wa r.  I™m sorry.  Then
 they had to run, because the Germans were

there.  Whoever was left from the family.  He 
ha d two sisters and a brother there.  The other 
brother was already on the front.  And they had to
 run.  So I never knew about it.  A cousin who 
came five years ago to America, the painter, he
 was telling me  the whol e story.  Wh y and how 
they had to run.  And they went past Odessa and 
they lived in a small village in a house, he said, 
what didn™t have floor.  It was 
nothing, just dust on the floor.  And they ma naged to escape, but 
they had very, very hard times.  His parents were
 alive that time, but the father and the mother, 
they all died.  Actually they say that it was 
from hunger they died, but
 I don™t know actually 
what was the reason they died, because they had 
very, very hard time s.  And after that my 
cousin, who had his mother– no, I™m sorry.  The cous
in, he has a sister, who 
is very, very sick.  
She™s here too, in Boston.  And hi m and the sist
er and the husband, and she had a daughter the 
same  age as George is and a son, they settled 
down in Odessa.  So, when the doors were opening 
here that the Russians can come
, he didn™t think about it.  He
 was just writing me , ﬁSa ve my 
daughter,ﬂ who lived in Moscow and had two l
ittle children.  I told
 you that story.  No? 
 

Q: I don™t think so. 

 

A: She had two little, beautiful daughters and her 
husband was Jewish.  And she was a half-Jew, 
because her mother wasn™t Jewish.  And the mot h
er was a practicing Russian Orthodox, so she, I 
think she brainwashed her.  But she™s supposed to come  to America, too.  She was on the quota, 

too.  In fact, they are still bot
hering me that, ﬁWhe re is she? ﬂ 
 I says, ﬁMany times, I™ve told you 
that she won™t come , never.  Please cross her o
ff  because she is taki ng some body™s place.ﬂ  They 
lived with the husband™s mother, whose husband die
d, he was injured in the war.  I don™t know, I 
think he lost his leg.  He went
 underground with the Russians.  
I don™t know that whole story, but 
I know that they had an apartment in Moscow a
nd the son lived with the mother.  He went to 
school in Moscow and he is an engineer.  She,
 he me t my cousin in school, who went for 
engineering, too.  Civil engineers.  They me t 
there and he knew that she™s half-Jew, but she 
promised him everything, everythi
ng what you want.  If they are 
going to have children they are 
going to be brought up as Jews.  And then she ha
ted Communism, she just couldn™t stand it.  I 
didn™t know why, but when I found out it was too 
late already.  Because she couldn™t go to 
church.  So they came to America.  The first Hanukkah, the television came  here to our house 

and took pictures from them, because they were 
here for the first Hanukkah.  So they are here, 
they were here for six years.  Now it was 
my husband™s, my s on™s birthday, Nove mbe r  20
th
, they 
came six years ago. 
 

Q: So they came to Lexington?   Or–? 

 

A: They came to Lexington.  I was fighting for them that they should come  here, because I didn™t 
have– only parents should bring 
children.  But the mother ha
d a brother in Brooklyn and the 
brother wanted them to go to Brooklyn.  And I 
got his name  and I spoke to him and I said, 
ﬁLook, I know that you love your sister, but the ch
ildren, they would be much, much better off 
here in Lexington to bring up children.ﬂ  Finally 
he gave in and the Federation did it for me .  
They brought them here.  They were waiting for them with a three-bedroom apartment, because 

the two mothers should come after them.  So, th
ey had a three-bedroom apartment.  And the 
televi sion was on the ai rport, when the fi rst families came.  It was a big deal.  And Ana was out 

of her mi nd that she will
 have some  relatives–

Q: Ana is your granddaughter? 
 

A: Ana is the youngest.  And there were
 two, young children, beau
tiful two children. 
 

Q: Can you say– before you go on, just, can you say how
 they™re related to you?   And what their 
names are? 
 

A: Mycousins– 

 

Q: Uhhuh. 

 

A: My cousin™s daughter, my first c
ousin, my father™s brother™s daughter. 
 

Q: Okay.  And what was her name? 

 

A: Galina. 

 

Q: Galina–? 

 

A: GalinaBashikis 
(ph)
.  Bashikis.  My son, by coincide
nce got him a job with the Gray 
Construction Company, because she had a student, 
he had a student in one of the schools, who 

was his student and then she became a teacher.  And 
he went back with hi s children there.  He 
goes always, one seme ster he takes his class to 
schools and they are– Ad
opt a School, that™s the 
name of it.  And they are teaching there, but they
 are just  st udents, not gr aduate st udent s and he™s 
observing them be fore they ma ke their lesson plans 
and they have to show it to him.  And he™s 
running from class to class.  And one day, she 
came  to that school and she said, ﬁDoes anybody 
know some body who has connections to a construc
tion company? ﬂ  And that teacher, he says, 
ﬁMy fiancé,ﬂ one of the Grays™ son.  He says, 
ﬁMy fiancé.ﬂ  So, from that time on they hired 
him, and he™s a person who, he didn™t mi nd what ki
nd of job they gave him.  He did very hard 
job.  And he loves the construc
tion.  He loves to see.  He
 was in, I don™t know how many 
buildings he builded.  He  was already a big shot 
there.  When they got their vi sa to come to 
America.  And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow.  In the mi ddle of Moscow 

the apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law.  And they would 

have a beautiful apartme nt there.  And the visa wa
s starting to expire, so my cousin said, ﬁIt is 
not worth, what is thousands of 
thousands dollars that apartment.
  It doesn™t worth, you have to 
go.ﬂ  He was in Odessa, but he helped them.  He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and 

they came.  And she was very happy.  And when sh
e got to the apartment she couldn™t believe it.  
You know, they lived in two sma
ll rooms there, so many people, four.  I mean two children and 
the couple and the grandmother.  And she was very happy.  One day– she sent, before she 

came, she sent a hundred and twenty packages 
to my na me , because she didn™t know where to 
send it and they were all Russian books.  And I sa
id, ﬁThat wo man is crazy.  She needs American 
books.  Why is she sending the 
Russian books? ﬂ   But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever.  The 
children, the big one– the little one
 didn™t go to school yet, but th
e big one went to school, to 
the same school where my husband got the job from
 the teacher.  It was in their neighborhood.  
And she spoke beautiful English already and she had– when the grandmother came  the 

following year in January, his mother came.  
She didn™t come , the other one.  And she was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

helping her and she was translati
ng and answering the telephone.  A
nd then I started to see it.  I 
started to invite them fo r holidays, and she came. 
 She sat at the table five mi nutes and after five 
mi nutes she excused herself and went to the porch 
to play with the children.  I didn™t think about 
nothing, about it.  I says, ﬁIt™s a 
little strange, but okay if she wa
nts it.ﬂ  When it come  the second 
year, she sa id, ﬁI love you, but please don™t invite
 us for the holidays.ﬂ  Still I didn™t think it was 
some thing wrong there.  Then she me t a couple, 
I still don™t know who th
ey are, a Christian 
couple, who went every week to Cincinnati.  And 
she got very friendly with them.  And she went 
with the two children and the re
ason was, because  she went for 
his American degree, what he 
got, no problem.  He got  his American degree,but when the children are home , he cannot study.  

And we go there.  It™s more things to do there. 
 We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah.  
One day they come  home, it was probably a year 
later and the father is asking them, ﬁHow was 
the zoo? ﬂ  And the big one said, ﬁWhat kind of z
oo? ﬂ  He says, ﬁYou didn™t go to the zoo?ﬂ  She 
says. ﬁNo, we went to the church.ﬂ  So he got ve
ry upset that she does it
 behind his back.  Very, 
very upset.  And I don™t know whet
her they knew it– he was ma rried eleven years, but they 
knew each ot her five years already from the scho
ol.  And I don™t know the situation, because the 
grandmother was there with them.  But he was 
traveling a lot.  The compa ny was sending him 

constantly, because they mostly work outside fr
om Lexington.  They build big, big factories, not 
housing.  And he was always sent out.  One, two y
ears after they were here, she says, ﬁI want to 

go home  for  the summer , to visit my mother.ﬂ  I sa
ys, ﬁIsn™t it easier to bring your mot her here? ﬂ   
She says, ﬁNo, my mother wouldn™
t like it here.ﬂ  She packed.  And she liked me .  She was 
working in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she wa
s an engineer and she we nt for courses to– 
computer courses to the community college.  Bu
t that job, cleaning job, 
she took at night, that 
she should be with the children during the day.  
What was the job?   She was calling me  on the 
phone constantly for hours.  She says, ﬁI am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices–ﬂ and she says, 

ﬁIt™s– in an hour I am ready.ﬂ  Perfect.  Salary
 was perfect, everything wa
s perfect.  Two years, 
right two years after in the summer, it was A
ugust.  And sometimes I was taking her, I was 
driving her to work.  They didn™t 
live close here, but I picked her up. 
 They lived in, it™s Heritage 
Village, ne ar Henry Clay High School.  That™s wh
ere all the Russians live d at that time.  I™ m 
sorry.  I picked her up and I took her to work. 
 And she says, ﬁI want to tell you some thing, 
because I love you.  But you must swear that you 
won™t tell it to Mischa.ﬂ
  Mischa, Michael is 
her husband.  I thought, ﬁMy God wh
at it could be that I cannot tell it to him? ﬂ  So, I says, 
ﬁOkay, I swear.ﬂ  And I am driving.  I almost ma de
 an accident what I heard.  She says, ﬁI™m not 
comi ng back.  I took a ticket, r
ound trip, but I™m not comi ng back.  I don™t want my c hildren to 
be brought up here.  I want them to be brought up as Russians,ﬂ and it meant– because she 

never me ntioned Jew.  She me ntioned Americans and Russians.  I says, ﬁYou are talking about 

Americans as Jews and Russians,ﬂ right away 
I knew, ﬁ–as the Russian Orthodox Church? ﬂ   
She says, ﬁNo, no.  I don™t mean that.ﬂ  I says, ﬁYes you mean it.  You mean it.ﬂ  The husband 

was– I don™t know where.  And he came home , a
nd it was the little one™s
 birthday.  And she 
ma de a birthday party and I was there.  And th
ey™re supposed to leave 
the following day to New 
York.  And the father, who lived in Boston, wa
s visiting– we have a 
summer home in the 
country, in the Catskills and he was with my son 
there.  And he™s supposed to go to the airport, 
help her to go to the airport in New York.  So, I 
said to myself, I just c
ouldn™t believe it.  I says, 
ﬁ Why are you doing it?  How can you look in your
 husband™s eye and pack?ﬂ  I don™t know, 
everythi ng she took, what she coul d.  Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone 

of them and they were little kids.  She says, ﬁIf he
 would be better to me –ﬂ 
 I says, ﬁBetter?   He 
lives for you.  He™s such a father and worki
ng like unbelievable that youshould have everything.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

And you say better? ﬂ  Better was that
 he didn™t let them go to church.  That was the worst.  And 
she told it in the hospital that 
if I don™t come  back, because my husband is bad to me .  So, what 
shall I do?   I swore.  I cannot te
ll it to Mischa.  I called my cous
in in the country.  I says, ﬁLook, 
I swore that I don™t tell it to Mi
scha, but I didn™t swear that 
I™m not telling it to you.  Your 
daughter won™t come  back.  Please don™t help he
r to go on that plane.  At least the children 
should be saved and taken away, because shekidnapped them.ﬂ  She said, ﬁThat™s– it™s 
impossible.  It™s impossible.ﬂ  And when she di
dn™t come  back after a mo nth, she went for a 
month, and I said, I told it to
 Mischa.  She says, ﬁI don™t believe you.  She™s the most honest 
woman in the world.  If you would tell it to me right
 at that time, I wouldn™t believe you, that she 
is doing it to me .ﬂ  And she did 
it.  She kidnapped the two kids.   
 

Q: Tell me , Mischa was the one who™s actually related to you? 

 

A: No.  She. 

 

Q: She™s the one who™s actually related to you. 

 

A: She is my c ousin™s.  But I am– they have no one 
here.  He has a brother, he™s in Australia.  And 
he is here now with his mother.  He doesn™t wa
nt to hear about it, to get ma rried, because he 
lives for his children.  I says, ﬁM
ischa, you are a smart 
ma n.  You lost your children.ﬂ  Every 
week, he is calling them on the phone.  And two y
ears ago, she let them come here for a month.  
They came alone by plane.  And she came the last  two weeks, because my cousin was begging 

her from Boston, that ﬁMaybe I 
see you the last time.  I am i n not a good condition and please 
come .ﬂ  She came.  Be fore they came , he bought 
a house.  They lived in an apartment.  They 
bought the house, that the childre
n should have separated rooms.  It™s a three-bedroom house 
near Man O™War.  A new house.  He ma kes nice money, so he could, he got the mortgage.  And 
the children they have their rooms and they have their beds there what I 
bought them that time .  
The ma ttresses were brand new.  And they have
 their– and even toda
y, it™s they name  on the 
door.  They put they name  on the door.  What – wh
ere do they have it in Moscow?   They have 
two bathrooms.  They give one to the children. 
 And they live like princesses here.  They loved 
it. 
 
Q: Let me  ask you a couple of questions, so I can
 ma ke sure I™m understanding.  She converted– 
did she convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy? 
 

A: Shewasn™t. 

 

Q: She was raised as a Russian– 

 

A: She was raised nothing, because it wa s Communi sm
.  She couldn™t be rais
ed with religion.  But 
when Gorbachev took over they were allowed to
 go to the church.  And when she saw it, she 
already didn™t want to come  to
 America.  She was the one who broke, broke, completely broke 
off the fa mi l y.  She wanted to come .  She was the one.  And she was telling me  that she thought 

that she wouldn™t come a nymore, but she said, ﬁT
hat™s not the right thing 
to do.  That™s not an 
honest thing to do, that I started it and I should le
t them go.ﬂ  But that was an honest thing what 
she did.  You know?   She wanted it.  She wanted
 to come  because of the church, because she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

couldn™t go to church there.  They have here
 a Greek Orthodox, but that™s not good for her.  
Anyway. 
 
Q: Let™s rewind a little bit.  We started ge tting 
onto this because you were talking about your fa mily 
that was in Russia.  And you didn™t know any of that
 family other than your
 father™s brother?  
During the war or before? 
 

A: No, I knew before the wa r about the whole fa
mily, because when my fat her was alive they 
corresponded constantly.  And we, fr om Czechoslovakia, be cause I was br ought up in 

Czechoslovakia, we sent them food.  So, I kne
w they exist.  And I reme mb er when my 
grandmother died, my fat her™s mother, because 
I reme mber how he was crying.  I was about, I 
don™t know, eight years old.  And I reme mber when 
she died.  I don™t remember when the father 
died.  And I knew about him very we ll, because he
 speaks– no.  Then my uncle was writing him 
constantly– 
 

Q: Your uncle was writing who? 

 

A: Wr iting to him.  My unc le was my father™s brothe
r, to whom I  wanted to come  to Ame r ica.  He 
was a pharmacist .  And he came with the last ship
 in 1940 to America.  And then he was writing 
him.  And after 50 years, 50 year
s, he went back to visit. 
 And he was telling me  about– 
 

Q: I™m sorry, but you™re talking about– he was writing to whom?   To his father?   Wh en you said 
your uncle was writing to hi
m, who was he writing to? 
 

A: To Izzy, his name  is Izzy, my cousin who is th
e painter.  He was writing 
to him and then he went 
to visit.  And he had two sisters, two sisters a
live at the time and him, who was the nephew.  He 
was alive.  So, after 50 years.  He went back tw
ice, because he  went alone and then he took his 
wife one year.  And so, I knew ev
erything about him.  And I knew th
at he was a big artist there, 
but he worked for the state, Communism.  They al
ways had work, but they had to do what they 
told them to do.  So, he was a real
 artist and then he had a little 
studio separate from t he house.  
And he painted what he wanted, 
because his dream– he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint 
Odessa as he knew it once.  And he did it.  
They didn™t know about it, because he did the 
commercials for everything, for the ships a
nd for operas and everyt
hing.  His name  was 
everywhere because he di d the commercials.  So, 
I knew about him.  Now, when my uncle died 
in 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one 
else.  And I started to
 write Russian, but it 
was very hard for me , because I ne ver spoke Russian.  But I wr ote Russian and I understood 
Russian.  So, with the dictionary, I wr ote him Ru
ssian.  And one day, he 
said, ﬁDon™t struggle, I 
speak English.ﬂ  And from then on, I was sending
 him English letters.  And then he had an 
exhibition in Moscow and he was narrating it in 
English.  And he sent us the tape.  And we 
couldn™t use the tape here.  I had to take it to
 downtown.  I don™t know wh
at™s the name  of the 
place.  Anyway, where they re-did it.  It was a b
eautiful– I gave it to him when he came.  I gave 
it back to him.  I says, ﬁI have you, and I have 
your paintings, and you should have that tape.ﬂ  

And I read in the Hadassah paper, last mont h, that his paintings are still– some body, you know 

they have articles about the wo
rld, travelers and it was from Odessa and they me ntioned his 
name , that his paintings are stil
l there, but he™s not there anymore.  So, that was my Russian 
fa mily.

Q: Okay, tell me  your father™s full name  and– 

 

A: Mikhail, he was Michael, 
Mikhail Klugma n, because we 
never knew Klegma n.  Klugman. 
Mikhail Klugma n.   
 

Q: And tell how he came t o leave Russia. 

 

A: He was from First Wor l d Wa r– it is not on the tape?   No.   

 

Q: It is, but I have more questions. 

 

A: In First Wor l d Wa r there were two brothers. 
 The older brother was al
ready in the war in 1914, 
before–.1914, yeah.  And he was a pharmacist, too.  
Both of them were pharmacists.  And he 
was captured and they didn™t know about him, where is he.  And one day, when my father was 

called in and he was captured in Prague and they
 took him behind the frontier to a pharma cy and 
there he me e t s his brother.  And he met his brot
her and they never separated.  They didn™t want 
to go back after the war because there were the bi
ggest pogroms in Kiev and they didn™t want to 
go back there.  And it was an international agreem
ent that they can stay in the countries where 
they were captured.  Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire.  So, 

after a while when they were there, they took 
them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of 
them, together.  I have, I think there™s a picture 
there, too, about them in Russia uniforms.  They 
took them to Hungary and under the war my mother was working there in the office, in that 

place.  And that™s how they met and fell in love. 
 And my mother™s family was very, very upset.  
Nothing against him, it was nothing against him,  but
 they were very worried that he™s a Russian 
citizen, what™s going to be?   Fr om 
then on, I think it™s there.  No?

Q: First actually, can you say whatyour father™s brother™s name was? 

 

A: JacobKlugma n. 

 

Q: And so they are living nearby one anothe
r and they ended up in
 Czechoslovakia.   
 

A: Yes, because they had to, because it was Co
mmunism in 1919 in Hungary for a little while only 
and they said that no ma tter what, every Russian 
is a Communist, Jew or 
non-Jew.  And they put 
Œ oh I have a picture here.  It™s 
very interesting.  They ma de a 
concentration camp.  They builded 
near Russia– near Budapest and they put all th
e Russians there.  My mother was married in 
1919, the beginning of 1919.  And they put them th
ere.  They didn™t know what™s going to 
happen to them.  My unc le was there.  He wasn
™t ma rried.  My mother had a cousin, who was a 
lawyer and he came there one day.  It was 
already May, mi ddle of 1919, because she was 

pregnant with me .  By the way, she got pregnant. 
 She was pregnant with me .  And she said, he 
said, ﬁYou can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come  back to 

Hungary.ﬂ  So, my mot her, who was Hungarian, sh
e had to sign that she never come s back to 
Hungary.  It was easy to sign it for my father a
nd my uncle, but they had to sign it.  So, where 
should they go?   In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was,
 the Czech ma p is Czech, Moravia, Slovakia, 
Carpathan.  The Carpathan part, wh
at was Hungary, after the war, th
e Czechs got it.  My mother 
had a second cousin there and when she heard a
bout it, what happened, she says, ﬁCome to us.ﬂ  
They were well-to-do people.  ﬁCome to us.ﬂ  So, 
they went there to Czechoslovakia.  It was at 
that time Cz echoslovakia in 1920.  When it came to 
me , to give birth, my mother got permission 
through that lawyer to go home  and I was born in
 my grandmother™s house, but they didn™t have 
an apartment.  They did have– they lived with th
ose relatives, so they left me  there with my 
grandmother and my mother™s sisters.  She had th
ree sist ers.  One of them was married, two were 
not ma rried and a brother, who was never ma rried.  He was a bachelor .  Because my 

grandmother was a widow when she was 34 years 
old, and she had five children.  The son took 
over and he was working for the family.  And t h
at™s why he never got ma rried, until the sisters 
got ma rried and whatever.  He was already 50 year
s old and he didn™t get ma rried.  So we lived 
there and 22 months after I was 
born, my mother was again Œ she 
was pregnant.  She gave birth 
to my sister.  The same  thing happened.  She 
went home with special papers and she wa s born 
there in my grandmother™s house.  By that time 
they had already an apartment and they took me  
together  with my little sister back to Czechoslovakia.  So. 
 

Q: Okay.  What was your sister™s name? 

 

A: Anna.  But she was two ﬁn™sﬂ and she didn™t want
 two ﬁnﬂ.  My daughter-i
n-law, she didn™t want 
two ﬁnﬂ.  Not because  of my sister, but she ha
d a grandmother, whom 
she didn™t like, and she 
was Anna.  So, that™s why she™s with one ﬁnﬂ, An a, but she™s name d after my sister.  And the big 

one, Ilona.  That™s a real Hunga
rian name .  She™ s name d afte r 
my mother™s youngest sister, who 
saved my life.  That™s in there,
 I think.  So, Ilona is name d af
ter her.  And Jacob, the boy is 
name d after my uncle, who was in America.  But she has an uncle, too, my daughter-in-law.  

And she didn™t want him to be name d Jacob, be
cause she didn™t like Œ she doesn™t like her

fa mily.  That™s the trouble here.  She doesn™t 
like her mother.  She never got along with the 
mother.  That™s the big trouble 
and that™s why she cannot get al
ong with me  because she doesn™t 
want to hear mother.  Only she™s the mother. And that™s the problem.  So.  But we ma nage to 
give his, the name  Jacob, because she liked my uncle.  She knew hi m and she liked hi m. 
 

Q: Tell me  about your early chil
dhood, and your earliest me mories. 
 

A: I reme mber from kindergarten on.  I went righ
t away to Czech school.  
Kindergarten, elementary 
school, gymnasium.  I wanted to be a pharmacist. 
 And they had two kind of– my father wanted 
one of us, at least, to be a pharmacist.  And we 
had two kinds of gymnasiums, very strict schools 
in Czechoslovakia.  All the prof
essors were from Prague.  And 
there were two kinds, one where 
you had to learn Latin, because every prescription 
was Latin and if you wanted to be  a doctor or 
pharmacist you had to go to that gymnasium.  So 
I went to– both of us went.  I don™t even know 
what she wanted to be, because she was unbelievabl
e smart, much s marter than I was.  She was 

always worried about me , my sister, because 
it wa s only 22 months between us.  And when I 
went to first class, I got whooping 
cough for six months.  So I had to repeat the first class, so we 
were always together.  We sat t
ogether.  Here they don™t let you do 
it.  We were always together 
and everybody thought that we were– I don™t know
.  Because we were dressed the same  and 
they thought that we are twins, but we  weren™t 
because it was 22 months between us.  But we 
were together always in school. 
 But she was a worrier always about me .  I reme mber when she 
woke me up in the morning and let me repeat
 the lesson plan, lesson, what we had to do, you 

know.  She was always worried about me .  I wa s a 
good student, but to her it
 came  very easy.  To 
me , I had to work for it.  And it was a very, ve
ry close family.  I just
, I cannot, cannot tell you.  
When they me t, my father and mother on the st
reet it was always like, you know, they were 
ma rried yesterday.  Very, very close.  My moth
er was like a friend to us.  With everything you 

could go to my mother and ask everything what 
you wanted and you got the right answer.  I was 
a very, very naïve girl, very 
naïve.  And one girl was once 
telling me  that if you kiss some body 
you can get pregnant, that kind of a 
business.  So I always we nt to my mother.   I says, ﬁIs it 
true?ﬂ  I don™t know what grade was it.  But w
ith everything–when I we
nt on a date and I came 
home , I went to their bedroom, I sat on the bed an
d I told them everything what happened.  That 
kind of a close fa mily we were.  And that™s 
why I cannot understand toda
y™s generation, because 
it was so different.  Whe n I said to my grandda
ughter that I went for,
 for four years I had a 
boyfriend, a boy friend, friend, nothin
g happened between us.  And fo
r one year, for one year, he 
didn™t even kiss me, because he said he™s very af
raid that if he™s going to ki ss me, I™m going to 
leave hi m, because of my personality.  He was 
an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he 
left a very wealthy gi rl because of me.  He love
d me very mu ch, but I was so naïve that I didn™t 
think that I love him.  But it 
was a beautiful, wonderful
 feeling that every 
week he came .  We 
me t twice a week, Saturday and Sunday.  Every 
week he came  and his hands were behind his 
back and he brought me  Œ because he knew I love
d the– what are the li
ttle blue flowers? 
 
Q: Forget-me-nots? 

 

A: Very, very little. 

 

Q: Forget-me-nots? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

A: They are not forget me – anyway– 
 

Q: Violets? 

 

A: Violets.  Wi nter, summe r , always, always wh
en he came, he had the violets.  And it was a 
wonderful feeling to know that 
you have some one to go out with 
to the movies.  We  had five 
o™clock teas there.  It was 
a very nice place where young people got together.  And then he 
started to be called to the Army.  And when 
he was called to the Army he was some where 
always close, so he eloped.  He came home  
to see me  on the weekends.  And everybody was 
telling me  that he™s looking at me  like he loves 
me .  And I was just laughi
ng.  I didn™t realize it.  
I didn™t realize it.  After four years when I me t my husband and he was already some where in 

Russia, somewhere in labor camp, him.  And he wr
ote me  and I wrote him.  And I wrote him that 
what happened with my family and I™m going to ge
t ma rried, because I need to change my na me .  
And when I wrote that letter I thought I™d die.  
Then I knew that I loved him.  That feeling, I 
never, never forget.  Such a naïvete. 
 Can you ima gine that?   Then I really– 
 

Q: What was his name ?  

 

A: And he died.  He died in Russia.  He was Ni cholas.  He was Nicholas, 
 actually it was Nicolash 
(ph ) 
in Hungary.  So it™s Nicholas.  They were a 
very wealthy fa mily.  His father had a pawn 
shop.  And he had a sister, who was teaching 
pi ano.  And we never spoke about ma rriage 
because he always said, he spoke already Eng
lish at that time.  And one day, in 1938, the 
Hungarians took back that part of Czechoslovakia. 
 So we were in trouble, but we children didn™t 
realize it that we are in trouble, 
only my parents.  And it was terribl
e.  And then he said to me , 
one day when he came home, he says, ﬁCome with 
me  to Israel.ﬂ  I looked at him.  I says, 
ﬁ Without my parents?ﬂ  And it was no Israel, young 
people went to Palestine.  Maybe he would 
be alive, if he would gone.  He wouldn™t go w
ithout me .  And I says, ﬁI cannot go without my 
parents.ﬂ  And he came back from some place.  
And we were always disc ussing other girls, and 
who is the cute girl, who is the nice girl.  And 
one day, I was already ma rried, when I heard that 
he engaged, a year later, he enga
ged a girl, whom we were discussi
ng, that she is a nice girl.  But 
they never got ma rried, because he di ed in– they
 took him to Russia, that transport labor camp.  
And he died.  And he was the only one who died 
from his family, because he had a brother who 
survived in England and his pa
rents and sisters survived ther
e in Uzhgorod where we lived.  
People were hiding them.  He was the 
only one who died from the fa mily. 
 

Q:  What was his last na me? 

 

A: Gosh, I cannot believe it, that I don™t reme mber. 

 

Q: That™s okay, that™s okay.  How ol
d were you when you started dating him? 
 

A: 18.   

 

Q: So, you started dating him in 1938? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
11
 
 
A: Yes, when the Hungarians came in, yes.  And 1941, until 1941.  In 1941, I me t my husband in 
Budapest and he was already– I don™t know which 
lagers
.  He was in labor camps, but they 
took them out from that part of Czechoslovakia.
  They took them out to Russia.  In Hungary, 
they kept them in Hungary 
in labor camp.  But t hat was 
part of, you know, that was __________ 
that time, they took, like over the border and th
ey took them to camps.  And when I wrote them 
that what happened, that I need another name .  A
nd he wrote me  back a letter and he said, ﬁIf 
you would have told me , I would right away ma rry you.ﬂ  And his friend was alive, very good 
friend and I me t hi m onc e.  And he said that fo
r one day he disappeared in the woods and they 
thought he is committing suicide because of me .  
But then he came and they took him and all of 
them died.  So, it was a terrible thing, terrible that
 I was so naïve, that I di dn™t realize it that I am 
in love.  Because I don™t even know.  I, I– we 
just kissed, that™s it.  And we  wouldn™t, he 
wouldn™t dare to do nothing, because he said th
at, ﬁYour personality is
 requiring such a–ﬂ ŒI 
cannot say it in English, that word.  Respect.  Th
at he was afraid to kiss me  for a year, because 
he thought that I am going to leave him if he is
 going to kiss me .  I don™t know whether I would 
leave hi m, because I was very naïve, after. 
 So it was like Plato– nobody believe d us.  Because 

they said when we went to the movies and we were like four couples toge
ther and they said, ﬁHe 
doesn™t look at the movies, he™s
 just looking at you.ﬂ  It™s an
 unbelievable thing, and when I am 
telling it to my grand-daughter
, she™s laughing, ﬁGrandma, those ar
e the nineties.ﬂ  You know?   
It took me  a long, long time to realize that my
 granddaughter were not seven years with his 
boyfriend and nothing happened between them.  I ju
st– I couldn™t imagine that some thing could 
happen– you know?   I trusted her, because I was 
that way, so I thought, always I thought that 
Ilona is ours, from our fa mily.  And my husband 
always said to me , ﬁNo ma tter what, you always 
can count on Ilona.ﬂ  He was 
always telling me  that.  And if you leave some thing for the 
children, he said, ﬁJacob is a boy, he will always ma
ke it.  Leave more for  Ilona.ﬂ  That™s what 
he always said.  He was mi staken, too. 
 
Q: Tell me, let™s go back a little 
bit again.  You me ntioned that you 
had wanted to be a pharmacist.  
Did your parents support that?   We
re they supportive of that? 
 
A: Yes, but I couldn™t, in ‚38 it was fi
nished.  I couldn™t go anymore to school. 
 

Q: Was it unusual at the time, for a girl? 

 

A: No, I don™t think so.  It was unusual, I knew one
 only, in the city, who was a pharmacist.  But the 
Czech girls, I don™t know what for, they tookLatin.  We  had all the Czech girls in the 

gymnasium.   And that was only– why would they 
take Latin?   Only if they wanted to be 

doctors or pharmacists.  But we didn™t get so far, 
that™s it.  And I never knew what my  sister, she 

still went one year to sch
ool when I was already in B
udapest.  Your back hurt you? 
 

Q:  I™m okay.  

 

A:  So, I just really don™t know.  
I never, I don™t know what she wanted 
to be.  It™s so interesting.  I 
know she was 22 years younger, 22 months, and it was 
very hard to me , like, to go for my first 
ball.  It was the me dical students™
 ball.  And at that time  he was already in the Army a nd one 
me dical student, who went in Prague to school, 
to me dical school.  Th
ey didn™t have me dical 
school there, now they have me dical school there.
  And he was a short fellow and he knew that I

am going out with that boy, but he was in the Ar
my, so he took me .  He came home  for vacation 
and he took me  to the Medical Ball.  I woul
d neve r forget that occasion, be cause it was 
chaperoned.  My mother was there and it was wint
er and we went on the sled with horses, you 
know, that kind of it.  I would never forget it. 
 And my aunt from Buda
pest– every year, every 
summer we went to Budapest, my mother™s fami l
y, and they always dressed us up, the children.  
I reme mber that she gave me -- it was hers, but it 
fit me  beautifully-- a light blue, long, velvet 
evening gown.  And it was open, but it has a pearlerie 
(ph) 
what I could take off.  I will never 
forget that day.  And he never, he didn™t let me
 dance with no one else.  Ot her boys wanted to– 
no.  The whole night he was dancing with me .  
It™s a very interesting story.  He became  a 
pediatrician in Prague.  And he
 went, I think that he went to German college.  They had two 
colleges, Czech and German, he or the other on
e, the dermatologist went– one of them.  The 
dermatologist, I had nothing to do with, becaus
e just my friend was ma rrying him and I know 
that he went to German college.  But he went, 
I didn™t know whether he is
 alive or not.  And 
when we came to Brooklyn, because that™s wher
e we came, to my uncle.  And one day I am 
walking on a street and I see a millinery shop, we
 had it in Hungary and I see the name.  And I 
went in, and it was, because she had one in Uz
hgorod in Czechoslovakia.  Can I hold it for you? 
 

Q: No, that™s okay. 

 

A: And she, that was his sister.  And she says, 
ﬁMy God, you are alive.  He™s not ma rried.  You are 
ma rried?ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes, I am married.ﬂ  And he 
came  to visit his sister from Prague and he 
wasn™t ma rried.  And he called me  on the phone 
one day and I didn™t see him.  My hus band was 
very jealous and I wouldn™t even dare to inv
ite him.  But my husband was working and I spoke 
about an hour on the phone with him.  And he
 was asking me , how I am doing and what I am 
doing and so on and so on.  And then he went ba
ck and he ma rried a German woma n.  I heard 
that he stayed in Germany, but he
 got divorced, too from that.  Fi
rst time he got married.  But he 
was in love with me .  And I knew that, that he 
wa s in love with me , but I would never like kiss 
him or some thing.  No way.  [Phone rings.]  
Doesn™t ma tter.  If some body knows me , they call 

me  on my phone.  Ana should be comi ng home . 
 Maybe she is going, calling me .  I don™t know. 
 

Q: We have a little more time left  on the tape. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: So, can you tell me  a little bit more about your 
early childhood?   First of all, were you attending, 
was this a public school you were attending? 
 

A: Yes, public.  We  didn™t have pr
ivate schools.  It was very intere
sting under the Czechs.  We  had 
religion in the school.  Every religion had their 
own religion.  We  had the rabbi comi ng in once 

or twice a week and the Christians had they pr
iest.  And the girls were
 sitting on his lap, the 
Czech girls, you know?   On the priest™s lap.  [La
ughter.]  Now, I know what it meant, but just 
unbelievable.  After school we went to a German-speaking religious school and we learned more 

about religion.  But it™s funny thatI know my teacher™s name  and I forgot what was, gosh, what 

was my boyfriend™s name? 
 

Q: YoumeanNicholas? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
13
 
 
 
A: I will remember it.  No.  The interesting thing 
is it was, what we learned, like pr aying, prayer, it 
was from my mother.  My mother, she was forcing 
us, like every Friday night we had to pray and 
always even if we were crying that it™s too much, too much.  It 
was hard.  Every week, one more 
page.  And actually we learned to pray frommy mother, not in school
.  We learned about 
religion from that rabbi.  We  
didn™t learn– we learned how to write, but that wasn™t He brew, 
that was like Yiddish.  But the alphabet was the 
same and it was a time that they had there a 
paper, newspaper, a Jewish paper.  And I could 
read it without punctuation.  I have no idea about 

nothing, that™s why I never could 
go up to the Torah and read the 
Torah, because I have no idea.  
I have to learn, if I would want to read some thi ng, I would break my neck to learn it.  You know?   

Because that™s without punctuation, the Torah.  
But otherwise I read fluently, but I don™t know 
what I™m reading.   
 

Q: What language did you speak at home? 

 

A: We spoke, first of all when they me t, it was– 
my mother didn™t speak Russian, he didn™t speak 
Hungarian.  Both of them spoke German, so it 
was German.  The starting was German, until my 
father learned Hungarian.  And it was German 
for a long, long time, because we had two hours 
of gymnasium, every day two hours German.  And 
the Czechs hated the H
ungarians.  My mother 
never learned Czech.  She just spoke German 
and Hungarian, because my grandmother spoke 
German.  When she was a little girl, she came fr
om Slovakia where the pa
rt, where German lived 
and she spoke German.  Not the Jewi sh, German.  
And when we went on the street and we were 
walking and we saw a professor coming from 
the  school, because those are professors in 
gymnasium.   It was like, what should I tell you?   
It was eight gymnasium,  
so it™s equal like four 
years college .  Because after eight, elementary school and then it was a– 
plipravka
 
(ph )
, 
between gymnasium and a year where we were pr
eparing to go to gymna sium.  It was a year.  
So, and we saw some  professor comi ng, so we right
 away started to pull 
my mother™s skirt.  
German, spe a king German, that they shouldn™t k
now that we speak Hungarian.  Because they– 
we spoke so well Czech, that they didn™t believe 
that we are not Czechs.  But then when they 
found out that we are not Czechs, but they di dn™
t know that we speak Hungarian.  [Laughing.]  
So, we had to speak German on the streets. 
 

Q: This must have gotten very
 confusing, just trying to– 
 

A: No, it wasn™t, when you are a child– and then wh
en we we re preparing to come  to America.  
We were preparing after we heard what™s happen
ing.  My parents are tellin
g us that we are in 
trouble.  And my uncle ma naged to come  to Amer
ica, so we started to 
learn English, private. 
 

Q: When was this?  What year? 

 

A: It was in 1940.  We  were preparing.  And it wa
s a teacher, who learne d in England.  He studied 
in England.  He wasn™t a young ma n.  And he was so
 proud of us, me  and my sister, that we are 
so good, that when we went– small town, bigger 
than here, but it was still– it was the capital 
of Carpathan.  It was a pr omenade.  They builded it up beautifully, the Czechs, that time, near 

the water.  We had a bridge divi
ding the city, so it was a very ni
ce city.  And it was a promenade, 
banks, sitting people, and he st
arted to speak loud to us, English, that was, you know, his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

commercial.  We  had had English, 
Anna Karenina
 and everything already.  We  were very good.  
So Czech school.  Czech I spoke perfect, Germ
an I spoke that time perfect, Hungarian and 
English.   
 
Q: Were you citizens of any–? 

 

A: Czech. 

 

Q: You became Czech citizens. 

 

A: We were Czech citizens.  After five years we were, or even earlier, we we re Czech citizens.  But 
when the Hungarians came  in, we 
were no citizens, because the C
zechs run away.  They went to 
Czechoslovakia.  But we couldn™t go because we 
weren™t born there.  And naturalized citizens 
couldn™t go with them and we were stuck there. 
 And that™s how my parents were killed.  The 
very first, because of that.  But the other Russi
ans, probably whoever is alive, oh, they are not 
alive anymore, because they were like  my father™s age.  But they were 46 years old when they 

killed them.  They was the same  age, my father 
and my mother.  And my 
sister was 19.  And my 
sister coul d escape, but he sa
ys, ﬁNo way, I go where my mot her goes.ﬂ  And I had that guilt 

feeling that I wanted to commit suicide because of 
that, too.  Because we were so close.  And he 

said, ﬁI go where my mot her.ﬂ  And we had no id
ea, where she went or what happened or where 
she going.  It was terrible, terrible.  And that 
aunt, my mother™s youngest sister, who was very 
well-to-do when she got ma rried, she was– they 
were very wealthy people.  And  she had one 
son.  And he™s on the picture that
 I think.  His name  was George.  My George is name d after 
him, because then he became the child of the 
family who– the two brothers, my uncle, my 
mother™s si st er™s husband, he was alive and his br other was alive.  Because they were in a labor 

camp in Hungary.  And when George was born, then
 George got his name  then, he had a little 
boy–

A: The whole family, my grandmother™s children, they
 were born all there, but my grandmother was 
actually from a place, Za m Plain 
(ph)
, it™s called, from Slovakia.  
I  told you that there were 
Germans there.  My Grandmother, but all th
e childrens were born there.  And all my 
grandmother™s sisters, who were living there too 
when she was a child, all their children were all 
born in Budapest.  Everybody was, you know, the c
ousins and everybody was born in Budapest.  
And there were plenty of them.  All of them, 
the least, had three children, my grandmother™s 
sisters, and more.  And she had, he
rself, she had five sisters and a 
brother, but they were all born 
in Hungary, in Budapest, as far as I know, 
in Budapest.  I don™t know no one who was born 
outside of Budapest.  Except for my husband.  He 
was– they were farmers, big farmers, in– I 
can™t even describe you where is 
it, outside, not in Budapest, of 
course.  It was close to Eger, 
Eger is a big city.  But they lived on a fa
rm when he was a young boy and they were very 
wealthy people.  And the first, I don™t know what
 year was it, when the Roma nians came  in and 
they took away the farm.  Second time the Russian

took away.  Three time s, everythi

over the Z and then 
horod

Mountains.  It was in a very nice 
place and a very beautiful city.  And 
to me , every city what is divide
d with a river, the city itself, 
it™s a beautiful city.  [Phone rings

Q: Did your mo ther work, continue
 to work after she got ma rried? 
 

A: No, she never worked.  She was just a 
hausfrau
, house mother, but we were struggling.  My 
father was– they were struggling until they– 
something happened with them.  My mother, I 

reme mber she ma de our clothes, everything, sh
e sewed alone by hand.  We didn™t have even a 
machine, a sewing machine.  But she tried the be
st and she tried to brough
t us up that we were 
really, everybody who spoke about us– and th
ere are only two peopl
e in Brooklyn, who knew 
my parents from my childhood, only two people, 
two friends I have, who knew them and how 
they are talking about th
em.  It™s terrible.  One lived in Prague, she got ma rried and then they 
came to America and her husband was a dermatologi
st and then he got Alzheime r™s disease.  
Anyway.  So, she, we became, we a r e still friends, but now telephone friends.  We  are talking.  

And she has two very successful 
children, unbelievable.  He™s a 
dentist.  Middle of New York, 
he has an office.  But they came after the Czech 
revolution that was in the sixties.  They came 
with everything, with furniture, with Steinway
 piano.  They brought everything with them.  
Oriental carpets.  Not as we came,
 because they didn™t let us take 
nothi ng with us when we came.  
But only two people.  And it™s so sad that only
 two people knew my parents.  You know?   It™s 
unbelievable.  Of course– no, my cousin, he does
n™t– in Canada, he doesn™t reme mber.  My 
cousin in Budapest, she reme mbers my parents.
  She was younger than my sister.  She™s younger 
than my sister was, but she is reme mbering my 
parents.  But otherwise, no one reme mbers my 
parents.  It™s very sad.  And I don™t know a
bout my grandchildren.  I wrote down everything.  
They have it on tape and still they are very 
mi xed up when I speak about an aunt, you see, we 
have some body by the name  of Ilou 
(ph )
, what was a sist er-in- law of 
my aunt, but they have the 
same name.  Because that was a second marriage to
 my uncle™s brother.  And the name  was the 
same  Ilou and Ilia 
(ph )
.  But the other one, the older one, 
she is not mi xing it up.  She knows the 
difference, who was Ilika 
(ph )
 to us and who is Ilou, she knows.  Ilou she knows, she was here 
too.  She™s alive.  That was my uncle™s sister
-in-law by second ma rriage, because the first wife 
died with the four year old li
ttle boy.  And he always wanted
 children, so he ma rried a younger 
woma n than him and she couldn™t have never childr
en.  But she has a big fa mily in Israel.  She 
has a brother and she has a sist er-in-law in Montreal, because  her brot her died when they came  to 
Canada.  When we came here, they we
nt to Canada.  And he was a paper 
(ph )
 engineer.  He 
wasn™t used to Canadian winter, slippe ry.  And 
he made a car accident  and he got a st roke from 
it.  And he didn™t die, but he got a second str
oke and he died.  And he was a young ma n.  He was 
42, some thing like that and he left
 his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada.  And the 
wife had a German nana.  She was a real 
German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her 
childhood.  Because she had very, ve ry wealthy pare
nts, and she had a sister, she di ed, too.  And 

her parents died, but that
 woma n, she stayed with her all through her life.  And she was bringing 
up her son, too.  And then she died in Canada.  She never went back.  She was from Vi enna.  

Very nice person.  I reme mber her so well.  I me t 
her ma ny times when we went to Canada.  First 
they lived in Montreal and they move d to Toront
o when the French started that you had to speak 

French.  He™s an engineer, too, my cousin. 
 

Q: Can you say some thing more– let™s talk 
more about your childhood.  Did you have any non-
Jewish friends who you played with? 
 

A: I had Czech friends, non-Jewish Czech friends, 
yes.  They were very good friends.  They had, 
they were entirely different– their 
thinking was different from ours. 
 First of all they were very

loose, the Czech girls, it was unbelievable.  Th
ere were many, many, even in my class, there 
were three twins.  Can you imagine?  There were
 ma ny twins, girls.  And, but they were good 
friends.  And then we had Hungarian friends, Jewi sh
 girls friends.  We  had.  We  had quite a lot.  
And we got together, before I went out with th
e boy.  We  got together alwa ys, every week at 
some body™s house.  During the week it was strictly
 studying.  And we went to movies and as I 
said– then we belonged to a 
Jewish organization, Kadima  
(ph)
, that™s actually, they have it in 
Israel now, too, Kadima . 
 

Q: Is that  a Zionist organization? 

 

A: It is a Zionist organization, 
yes, and it was a youth organization. 
 And in the summer we ma de 
excursions, but only for one day, in the mountai
ns together.  It was a very nice life in 
Czechoslovakia.  The Czech people are wonderful
 people and that was 
the real democracy.  
What I lived under, Masaryk and Benes 
(ph )
, that was a real democracy.  And I am la ughing 
when I am t a lking here about demo cracy.  I sa
ys, ﬁDo those people know what™s democracy? ﬂ   
You know, there are castes here and everywhere.  And even in th
e hospital– I worked 27 years 
in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital.  And there were 
very few people who were really, as you say, 
mensch
 people.  Like it was a old doct
or, he was the head of the Pediatrics.  He was the only one 
who went there in the morning and he shook hands 
with the elevator guy and some thing like that.  
You know?   It was– it was entirel
y different.  They speak here 
about democracy, but they don™t 
know what it is.  I reme mber that once before, my husband– my father had ma ny jobs before 

they had, they bought a– I don™t know what year 
was it.  They bought together a drugstore.  But 
drugstore, it means, because they di dn™t have th
eir diploma or certificate.  And I have my own 
diploma, Russian diploma.  So when he came 
to America, he worked in New York in a 
pharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the 
head of the Herbs departme nt.  They sell 
ma ny, many.  But he couldn™t do a 
prescription.  And that was the 
situation with 
my father,too, 
when they went to Czechoslovakia.  So they bought a drugstore, but they had everyt hi ng but 

prescription drugs.  But they didn™t have luncheone
ttes like here.  It was no 
such a thing.  But the 
trouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist 
died.  And it was a beautiful new pharmacy.  
And his wife wanted my  father to work for he
r.  Okay.  He took over and he was substituting 
outside.  He knew pharmacist s and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the 

pharmacy.  He knows, he did everything.  And th
en when he took over that pharmacy and my 
uncle had the drugstore.  And it was a big pl
ace and a small place, because everybody knew 

everybody.  So if some body went to 
my uncle, they were– they felt 
bad that they don™t go to my 
father.  That kind of a situation, you know?   It was 
very bad.  So on the end, he had to leave that 
pharmacy and he went back with my uncle, toge ther, because, you know, there were lot of 

Russian people.  They were non-Jews, lots.  And they knew all each ot her.  And one, oh, 

especially one, who let me  go to the office.  He
 had a very big position and he let me  go to the 
office and learn the Russian typewriter.  That™s
 how I knew how to type Russian.  But it came 
very, very good after the war, when I worked fo
r the dictionaries.  I wa
s the only one who typed 
Russian in Hungary.  So they were
 all friends, non-Jews and Jews, 
the Russians.  Of course, they 
were all educated people.  I™m not saying that th
e others were because pr obably they were anti-
Se mitic, like, you know.  Like it always was anti
-Se mitism in Russia.  But they were very good 
friends.  I never forget it, that 
one Christma s night, she said, ﬁY
ou must come  to our church.ﬂ  
It™s very interesting, the Russian
 Orthodox church.ﬂ  There, it was interesting.  No, I don™t want 
to hear about it, what happened w
ith her.  And it™s different, I s
ee it on the television.  That it is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
18
 
 
entirely different in Moscow what it was there. 
 It was a church where 
you didn™t have seats, you 
know?   You were all standing and he was like th
e leader there or whatever.  And everybody who 
came in got three kisses, you know.  Three time s you 
kiss.  Very friendly, very, very fr iendly.  
They were very, very nice people.  And then I reme mber it was a photographer, Kantor 
(ph )
 was 
his name .  And I don™t know how he  survived, because he wa s Jewish.  And he survived, I don™t 
know how.  They sent him back with the non-
Jews .  And then my friends from Brooklyn, who 

knew them t oo, and they were in California and they me t hi m.  He was alive for a long time and 

he me t their sons.  So that kind of, you know
, friends we had there, in Uzhorod.    
 

Q: How did that, how did that begin to change  after the Hungarian takeover of Uzhorod in 1938? 

 

A: It was terrible.  1938.  It was terrible becau
se– I don™t know whether I say some where that my 
cousin came and wanted to adopt us?  Okay.  My 
cousin, who was in Siberia for ma ny years.  He 
lived in Budapest, and one day he came  to Uzhor
od and he knew about the situation, that they 
were worried what is going to happen, because 
they were thrown out from Hungary.  He came 
and he said, ﬁI am going to adopt the children.ﬂ
  Under eighteen he could have done it.  ﬁAnd 
just the name will change .  They can™t stay w
ith you.  Just God forbid some thing happens that 
the children should be safe.ﬂ  And I reme mber the 
day that they called us and they called us in 
the bedroom, my father and my mo
ther and him.  And they explai
ned it to us and we started to 
cry.  We  thought that we are going to be taken aw
ay from them.  And we 
couldn™t understand it.  
Why?   Why?   Why?   Though I was 18 years old in
 1938.  But I just, we just– to take another 
name , and– they didn™t explai
n it to us, that what can ha
ppen.  You know?   Though we  knew 
the story.  We knew the story, but 
we didn™t think about it, that my
 fathe r  was never led back to 
Hungary.  Only my mother and us, every summer.  
He never was let back to Hungary to go back.  

And suddenly he™s traveling to Hungary, because 
Hungary is, we are Hungary.  And so after big, 

big discussions, we decided that we won™t do it. 
 We  children didn™t want to do it.  And that 
costed my sister™s life.  But my sister could 
be saved, and he didn™t want  because– or iginally 
when they went to that cousin, she wa nted to 
take my sister away, right away when she saw 
what™s going to happen, what™s happening.  I didn
™t know.  I wasn™t there in ‚41.  And my sister 
didn™t want to go.  She could have been saved.  And then she came, and she came– it was 

actually my grandmother™s side.  Somebody I don™t 
know how they were cousins.  I don™t know.  
Up to today I don™t know.  But she wanted, she told
 me  that she wanted to take her, but she is 
dead, too.  She went to the camps, too.  So probabl
y my sister, if she would take my sister, she 
wouldn™t be alive anyway.  But she says ﬁNo. 
 Whatever is going to
 happen, it™s going to 
happen.ﬂ  But nobody knew, nobody believed it that some  
thing is going to happe
n.  So, that™s it. 
 

Q: You were in Uzhorod in 1938 and then it became – 

 

A: In1941– 

 

Q: Did you stay there until 1941? 

 

A: My parents, yeah, I went in 1941, the first ti
me , alone, in May to– no.  In 1940, Christma sti me, 
I went with my sister, alone, Christma s vacation 
to my grandmother.  And one day, the boy with 
whom I went out and his friend, they came by car in
 Hungarian uniforms t o see us.  And I just, I 

couldn™t believe it.  It was very far away.  A
nd he was begging me  that I should go home .  He

felt some thing.  I didn™t.  I di
dn™t know nothing that time , be cau
se I didn™t know my husband.  
But he says, ﬁCome home and come home, and go 
home .ﬂ  I says, ﬁOkay, we are going to go 
home .ﬂ  But we had a good time.  They took us, 
I don™t know where we went.  Don™t reme mber.  
They stayed there two days they had to go back 
because they were in th
e army.  And we went 
back– 
 

Q:  To Uzhorod? 

 

A: In 1940 to Uzhorod.  We  went back home .  
And in 1941, in 1941, yes, in January, about in 
January, I ha d trouble with my rheuma tic fever, because I had rheuma tic fever when I was 

young, very bad.  I almost died from it.  Six months
 I was in bed, high fever.  That™s why I have 
heart trouble.  And I went back and my mother said 
that  ﬁYour sist er is still in school.  Go alone.  
You are now 21 years old, 1941.  You can travel alone
,ﬂ because it was about a day by train from 
Uzhgorod to Budapest.  ﬁAnd take th
e cure.ﬂ  I had a doctor there, 
who every year prescribed me  
a cure, what I had to take in a 
bath.  And he said that was a pr
ecaution.  It shouldn™t be trouble.  
ﬁAnd take your cure.ﬂ  Three weeks it took.  ﬁA
nd by the time you finished, we come  after you.  
Your sister  will be fi nished.ﬂ  And that was 
in May and I went.  And I went, and I met my 
husband, who we me t Christma s together when we we
re with my sister.  
We went.  We saw hi m 
once.  He was introduced to us once.  His aunt
 and my aunt were very good friends.  But he 
didn™t live in Budapest.  He
 didn™t live in Budapest. 
 

Q: Where did he live? 

 

A: My husband?   Outside in Eger.  
It™s a smaller town.  His sister liv
ed there.  And he came to his 
aunt.  And I went there with my aunt.  They
 played cards together
.  And suddenly some body™s 
opened the gates, I never– and it was him.  He 
had a cousin, who was older than him.  And I 
was expecting that he is going to open the door, 
but my husba nd, he opened the door.  And I just 
looked at him.  Who is he?   I neve
r heard from him.  And they intr
oduced us to him, so my sister 
knew him, only my sister.  And he was talki
ng to me .  And he was a very good looking guy.  
And he was seven years older than I was.  And 
he, the next few days we supposed to go back 
home  to Budapest, to Uzhorod.  
And his aunt, in the morning come s to my grandma ™ s house, I 
was in bed still.  And he says, ﬁEmilie,ﬂ my 
nickname  was Millie.  The whole family knows me , 

Millie.  My name  is Emi lie, officially.  And I di
dn™t know that Millie is 
in America a name and I 
just continue  being Emilie like in sc hool, when Iwent to school.  But my friends and my fa mily, 

everybody called me  Millie.  He says, ﬁMillie.ﬂ  Sh
e had a big voice, she says, ﬁFrank fell in love 
with you and he wants to ma rry you.ﬂ  I say, ﬁO
h please, don™t say me  this nonsense, some body 
sees some body and right away they want to ma rry? ﬂ
  I was not a bad looki
ng girl, that™s true, I 
must tell you.  [Laughing.]  But still it was very funny to me .  And he said, ﬁI know that you are 

going, you are going out with some body, but how is it
?   Is it serious?ﬂ  I says, ﬁI don™t know.  
We never spoke about marriage.ﬂ  We spoke abou
t ma rriage, but he always told me  that he 
cannot get ma rried until he is not on his own. He 
is in his father™s business and until then, he 
cannot get ma rried.  He spoke a few languages.  
He spoke already then very well English.  We  

never spoke about ma rriage, never.  I says, ﬁW
e never spoke about ma rriage.  I don™t know how I 
stand and whatever.  We  are friends, we are very
 good friends.ﬂ  So he sa
ys, ﬁNo, he™s serious.ﬂ  
I says, ﬁOkay.ﬂ  Next day we went back to Uzhor
od.  And I didn™t hear fr om hi m.  Only my aunt, 
that was my mi ddle sister of my mot h
er and she was a widow at that time.

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Serena.  And she said, ﬁI me t Frankﬂ ŠFerenz 
(ph )
, actually, FeriŠ ﬁI met him and he™s 
constantly asking me  when are you comi ng back, 
when are you comi ng back? ﬂ   So, one day I 
wrote to her, to my aunt, that I™m comi ng back to
 the bath.  Next day he was there, because that 
time he already lived in Budapest. 
 He had a business in Budapest. 
 

Q: What did he do? 

 

A: He was actually, he will finish 
business college.  He had a busin
ess, here they don™t have those 
businesses, because that time was everythi ng, the tr
anspor tation with horse and carriage.  And he 
was in business, I am always saying we are eatin
g his horse food, because, oat, oat.  That™s in 
Hungary horse food.  So, he had a business with 
oat.  But through the– it was a big business 
because he was connected to– I™m sorry, to– Wall 
Street, what is it?   
Wall Street business. 
 

Q:  Wal l St r e et? 

 

A: It wasn™t Wall Street there, but every busine
ss, big businesses were– so it was a big business, 
and he ma de  a lot of money.  And he lived there.
  But I knew about him.  They told me, he did 
tell me that time, that he just 
left his girlfriend, whom he went 
out for four years, because– his 
mother was against it because the girlfriend wasn™t 
Jewish.  And his sister 
already was married to 
a Catholic.  So she said, ﬁIt™
s enough, one person.ﬂ  She was converted, she was ma rried in a 
Christian church with popes, papers that she 
can get ma rried.  Her daught
er was born already as 
Christian.  And he loved his parent
s and he loved his mother and after four years he left the girl.  
The girl wanted to commit suicide.  It was a count
ry girl.  They had a rest
aurant there.  Because 
when he was living there with the same  business 
in smaller– it was small town and he had his 

little farm alone and horse and everything.  And he 
lived alone there.  And then he wanted to get 
rid of her because of his mother and he came 
to Budapest.  And once he came, she came after 
him, but I never met her.  But he was telling me that she came after him because she was so in 

love with him.  So anyway, so that was the stor
y that he fell in love 
with me .  You know?   She 
left– so, then I found out the story I says, ﬁOh, how 
do I trust him, if that™s the story? ﬂ  Because 
he left one, then he wants to ma rry me.  We ll,
 anyway.  So we  went out and it was already, I 
finished my cure and it was already war.  My uncle
 was al ready in America with the last ship and 
in ‚41 it was already bad.  And we went out fo
r a dinner and he brought his friend with him, who 
was in the same  business.  And we went to a re
staurant and people are looking in the papers for 

the news.  It was no television, radios were, but 
no televisions.  And he took a paper and he™s 

looking in a paper and I am aski
ng him some thing and he didn™t 
hear me .  And this way I did 
with my hand and I turned to his friend.  That 
he saw, that I wa ved and he took me  home  that 
night and I didn™t see him for three weeks.  He t
hought that I did it, that 
I don™t care about him.  
He was so sensitive, but I didn™t know that.  For 
three weeks I didn™t see hi
m.  The third week, I 
said, ﬁI™m going home.ﬂ   I said to his aunt, becau
se we were very close, even we lived very 
close.  And I said it to his cousin that I™m 
going home .  And he says, ﬁWhy, what happened? ﬂ  I 
says, ﬁI don™t know what happened. 
 I didn™t hear from hi m a nd that™s it.ﬂ  He went home to his 
mother, then his mother was telling me – I me t hi
s mother, very nice lady, she was very nice.  I 
me t his parents.  I went to Eger.  He took me  
once.  And she was telling me  that he came home

next morning and he was crying.  He was seve
n years older than me , 
that she finally found 
some body whom he loves, and she doesn™t want me .  He was – you know, it was a 
mi sunderstanding, the whole thing, but I didn™t know that he is such a sensitive guy, that he 

thinks– so it was a mi sunderstanding.  But he 
find out that I am going home.  Next day, it came 

a big rose, you know, flowers, and ﬁPlease don™t go.ﬂ

Tape 2, Side B 
 
 
A: –the ma rriage certificate and then I don™t know
.  I can™t reme mber what happened.  Probably– 
I don™t know.  Because I reme mber what my father wr
ote, that he™s gi ving his crown of his life to 
him and he should take care of her, that kind 
of a style, you know.  A
nd we agreed that my 
engageme nt will be third of July in my grandm
other™s house.  Because we don™t have my uncle 
anymore there and that those relatives were not
 so close relatives that we should ma ke an 
engageme nt.  Our fa mily was alwa
ys, my fa mily, my mother™s fa m
ily was always the family.  It 
was arranged everything, it was a Sunday and the 
whole fa mily was together, the sisters and 
everything.  I reme mber a beautiful table was ma de 
and my parents, my sister should come  up to 
the engageme nt and they never came.  That stor
y you know.  That they we
re called to the police 

and I got a telegram from our frie
nds that they called them to th
e police and they never let them 
out and ﬁYou disappear.  Go in hiding.ﬂ   
 

Q: Who told you to go in hiding? 

 

A: My friends who lived near us in Uzhorod, they 
were our friends and they lived near us.  And 
they saw when they, they knew that they went 
to the police and they ne
ver came out.  And they 
said, ﬁProbably they are looking for you,ﬂ because
 they knew everything, everythi ng who was 
not a citizen.  Because we weren™t 
Hungarian citizens.  The pa pers 
were at the police.  That was 
the police.  And they knew that you were four
 people and they got only three people, so you 
better go to hiding.  So, I couldn™
t get ma rried, because he was al
ready in labor camp, too, from 
1941 on.  But that time he was home still.  With th
e– he was in the Hungarian uniform, he was 
so gorgeous.  He was an officer.  And he– we
 couldn™t get ma rried, because in Hungary we 
couldn™t get ma rried.  Only when we were 24 years ol
d without the father™s consent, at  that  time.  
Can you ima gine?   Today you can get ma rried if 
you are ten years old, I think.  So, he went, 
short, right after, they stripped 
him of his uniform and he went to
 labor camp.  A
nd I stayed there 
with my grandmother and every ni
ght, I slept some where else.  
Some  other relatives and by his 
friends, because everything happened during the ni
ght, that they were looking for people.   
 

Q: Before we go on, you said some thing in the other 
tape I wanted to see if you could tell us more 
detail about, which was that your father came, 
was released from jail to come  and see you.  Can 
you describe that? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  So, we didn™t know what happened to
 them or whe r e they are.  And my, the youngest 
sister of my mother, Illie, Ilona
, they found out that they brought
 up a lot of, a transport from 
Uzhorod to Budapest and they put 
them like in a jail.  But they were ther e for two weeks, and 
they went to visit them.  They talked to them a
nd they went to visit them
.  And my mother told 
them that I shouldn™t come there, because I l
ook like her and it has no sense that I should be 
there, because they are going to get out from ther
e.  And one day they let out my father with a 
policeman for money to my cousin™s house, who wa
s in Siberia.  He lived very close to that 
place and he wasn™t home already, just his wife.  And nobody was in the apartment and the 

police brought my father there and he left, the po
lice.  And he says, ﬁI come  back–ﬂ this and 
that time.  I don™t know, it was an hour and a half
.  And I me t my father.  And first we just 
couldn™t talk, we were just crying 
and crying and we didn™t know what
 to say to each other.  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
23
 
 
he was just constantly questioning me .  ﬁ Are you 
sure that that™s whom
 you want to ma rry? ﬂ   
Because he knew about that I went out with that 
boy for four years.  And he said, ﬁAre you sure, 
are you sure? ﬂ   And worried about me.  I says, ﬁI
 am not sure of nothing, 
but I hope it will be all 
right.ﬂ  And he said, I said, ﬁLook, my aunt know
s his aunt and they know the family, so I hope 
it will be all right.ﬂ  And he called up from
 Uzhor od, he called Uzhorod and he called up the 
senators.  They were all Russians.  There were
 ma ny Russians, they we
re non-Jews in Uzhorod.  
And he knew everybody.  And they told him, ﬁD
on™t worry, tomorrow you™ll be out.ﬂ  And we 
parted and he says, ﬁI hope we see each othe
r tomorrow.ﬂ  And tomorrow came and my aunt and 
even my hus band, he wasn™t my husband at that tim
e, my aunt and her husband, they all went to 
the train station, because they said the peopl
e are going to go home  by train to Uzhorod.  
Everybody went back, who was non-Jew.  The Jews 
went in separate cars to Kama na Spodovski 
(ph )
, where they killed them.  And my husband, he had 
a very, very soft heart, like him.  And he 
couldn™t even, he couldn™t see th
e scene.  Though they went with 
regular cars, not 
like with cattle 
cars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hunga
rian soldiers.  He run away.  He couldn™t see 
it.  He just saw them from a distance.  And I th
ink my sister recognized h im.  I don™t know.  That 
was that.  And then a few weeks, about two week
s later, I got a card from my sister, in my 
sister™s handwriting, that ﬁ W
e are in Ka ma na Spodovski 
(ph )
.  We  don™t know what are we 
going to do here.  We  don™t know if we are going to
 have where to stay, but we are here.ﬂ  And it 
was a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a 
Hungarian soldier brought
 it back.  And what I 
know from t he museum, that™s why I went this 
Spring to the museum, I told you that.  To find 
out the truth.  Because she went first, my da
ughter-in- law, and asked about it, and me t there 
some body i n the library, who was very nice.  A
nd she, he showed her the book and he took out a 
few pages from the book and he made copies for me.  
And he  sent it to me .  He even spoke to me  

over the phone when my  sister, wh
en my daughter-in-law was there. 
 And he said, it wa sn™t that 
time that they killed them.  I always thought that they killed them when they left in July.  When I  

was there, I looked at the book, but 
I couldn™t buy it.  It™s such a 
big book.  It was not only about 
them, because, he said, they said, and it™s hereand it™s terribl e, that 38 thousand people were 

killed in one day, because they didn™t know what
 to do with them.  Because they took them to 

Poland and the Polish people were already in ghetto
s that time.  So they couldn™t help them.  
Nobody could help them.  And the Germans didn™t know
 what to do with them, so they let them 
ma de their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz.
  They took the clothes away, they put them 
on one line and on the orders.  They ma de a big, bi
g grave and they had to ma ke the grave.  And 
from the other side, the German sol diers were 
shooting them in the grav
es and right away, the 
tanks were running over them.   So I wanted 
that book, but it was no sense, because it was 
from– I have the pages what I needed.  And I se
e the pictures how they 
sit there on 
the end of 
the, the forest.  And the people– and I saw the–
 I told you about that 12 series what was on 
television, The Wi nds of Wa r?  You never heard 
about The Wi nds of War?  
 Mitchum played in 
it.  It started only four series.  It was a beautif
ul movie.  It was a French-Jewish writer, who was 
in France and his niece wa
s with him.  You don™t know that st
ory?   It™s Wi nds of War, is the 
name .  It™s in the public library.  After that 
they ma de a 12 s e ries, 12 two hours, 12 time s, the 
whole summer and I saw all of it.  It was a H
ungarian, originally he wa
s Hungarian, an actor.  
And his father was amongst those people who were
 taken and that was hi s idea to make that 
movie.  You see original pictur es what the Ge
rmans took.  Because it starts out like a colored 
movie and suddenly it™s black and 
white pictures.  And you see the tr
ains what we went in and I 
couldn™t look.  I said, ﬁI see myself s o me where 
there.ﬂ  But when I saw, I saw the whole thing, 
how they killed them.  And then I really co
ul dn™t look, because I said, ﬁMy God, I am going to

recognize either my sister or some body I™m going r
ecognize.ﬂ  I couldn™t l
ook at it.  Everything 
is in it, from the beginning to the end, with Ausc
hwitz, everything.  Twelve 
series and it is in the 
public library, everybody can borrow it. 
 
Q: Going back to that time, to 1941.  What did 
you, did you have any idea of what they were doing? 
 

A: Absolutely no idea.  No idea what they were 
doing, what is going to happen.  We  heard from 
Slovakia, what was near us, Slovakia, they ar
e taking young girls some where, only young girls.  
And where they are taking them and what they 
are doing with them, we didn™t know.  And they 
were taking them to Aus c hwitz, because I recognized
 one of them.  Four years later, I recognized 
one of them.  They were taking them there.  
They were building Auschw
itz actually.  And ma ny 

of them they made their lovers, the Germans, b
ecause they we re all pre
tty girls they took.  And 
then I knew, that they took them to Auschwitz
.  And when it was starting to happen, already it 
started near the, where Elie Wi esel is from– n
ear Romania it started.  
They started to take 
people.  And they were always saying ﬁIt canno
t happen in Budapest, it
 cannot happen.ﬂ  And 
when I said that it can happen, they always said
 ﬁYou are a pessimi st.ﬂ  It cannot happen in 
Budapest, that was the story.   
 

Q: So at the time, you are a young girl, you™re 21 ye
ars old.  Did you have any sense of the danger? 
 

A: I wanted to commit suicide, I wanted to comm
it suicide, first of all,
 because I didn™t know 
whether he will stay with me , my fia ncé.  He wa
s away.  I didn™t know what I am waiting for.  I 
knew my pa rents are some where.  I don™t know 
where.  It cannot be– I even went, it™s 
unbelievable, I even went to a fortune teller.  An
d I let him, show my palm and tell me about my 
parents.  And they said that ﬁThey are very fa
r away, don™t wait for them.ﬂ  That™s what she was 
telling me .  ﬁThey are in big da
nger.ﬂ  I just couldn™t understand it.
  But I had a feeling, that it™s 
some thing terrible happening, but I 
never had any idea.  No, never.  And when we we re going to 
Auschwitz, I didn™t know where we are going, but 
I said, ﬁAh, ma ybe we go some where, where I 
can see or meet my parents.ﬂ  If I don™t, 
I didn™t know where we are going.  Nobody knew where 
we are going.  It was just unbelievable.  So when
 I wanted to commit suicide, my aunt saved me , 
my mother™s younger sister, Illie, 
Ilona.  And she had a 13-year-old
 boy.  And three years, I was, 
it was terrible.  Every night I slept some where el
se.  And the third year, that before the Nazis 
came, she says, ﬁYou are not going nowhere.  Up to now they did look for you, you are our 

child, and you stay with us.ﬂ  And I stayed withthem.  I was like their child, they said.  They had 

a doctor who was, you know, house doctor, and he 
treated me  like they child, and I was with 
them. 
 

Q: So, you went into hiding in 1941.  Who was helping you? 

 

A: Until 1944.  Nobody was helping you, that was all fa
mily.  I went to my grandmothers, sisters, 
daughters, cousins.  And my husband had friends, they knew about it.  And I slept every night 

some where else.  During the day I st ayed with 
my grandmother.  And when I stayed with my 
grandmother, and I stayed there overnight, we we
re always in the baseme nt, because they were 
bombing us.  Terrible bombing, the Americans.  
They were going after the Germans, so they 
were bombi ng us.  In the morning we got up and we
 didn™t see nothing.  It™s 
very interesting that 
in that neighborhood it wa s nothing bombed, but my grandmother™s sister™s house.  Only one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
25
 
 
house was completely bombed and that™s– and ever
ybody is gone from  that family.  Only there 
is the girl, who is in Hungary.  That was that 
grandmother, that was that– her grandmother.  
Only that house was bombed, to the ground, nothi
ng else.  And she was the only one survivor 
from the whole family.  And she was holding ont
o me , me , me, me .  She wasn™t ma rried.  And 
she survived, because her parent s, when they 
saw what™s happening, they put her in a factory, 
like GE.  They ma de electric, but they worked for the army, a nd people who worked for the 
army, they didn™t take them to the camps.  They 
kept them in the factory until they finished the 

work.  In six months they were finished, then th
ey throw them out to the streets.  So then she 
standing there, nobody, no parents and nobody, so what
 is she going to do?   So she me t her 
aunt™s ma id.  She was a very nice person 
and she knew some body, a lady, whose husband was 
in– she was not Jewish and her husband was Jewi
sh and he was in labor camp.  He died, he 
never came back.  And that lady lived in a separa
te home.  She had a house and she took in a few 
Jewish people who didn™t have where to go, who 
came out from the factory.  And it was a doctor 

amongst them.  And my niece, my cousin was 
amongst them, whom she took in.  And she was 
hiding them.  And then the neighbors went and told
 on her, that she is buying too mu ch food and 
she™s alone, that it™s something going on there. 
 And that was found, that she pulled away the 
beds and all of them who were there, about eigh
t people, they ma de a bi
g, big hole in the ground 
and they slept every night, under the bed, in 
the ground.  And that™s how they were saved. 
 

Q: Do you remember her name ?  

 

A: No, I never knew her.  I never even knew her, no. 

 

Q: What was your, what was your daily life like, du
ring that time?   Those years that you were in 
hiding. 
 
A: Hiding?   It was terrible, because I was– 
where we were hidi ng– no, the Germans weren™t in 
there, only in 1944– it was terrible.  It was 
frightening, because I 
never knew that some body 
can grab me .  And I was afraid to go during the 
day through the streets, a
nd it was a terrible life, 
terrible.  And I was very, very depressed.  And 
they worked on me  very hard, really, that I 
shouldn™t commit suicide, because 
it was terrible.  Then he di
dn™t write to me, I don™t know for 
how long.  My fiancé.  So I didn™t know what 
was going to happen.  His parents were alive still 
and they live d in Eger, because they took away
 already the farm.  So they lived with the 
daughter.  She had a very big house.  A part of
 the house belonged to my
 husband, because that 
was an inherited house.  She inhe
rited it.  She went, can you imagine that she went to a convent 
to school, because that wa s the best school there. 
 And she was the only Jewish girl.  At  that time 
she was Jewish.  And when she was 18 years old and she came out, she me t that guy.  She had a 
lot of Jewish doctors, who wanted to ma rry he
r.  She me t that guy, who was a gorgeous guy and 
he had three kinds of doctorate, and he had a big, bi
g job with the states.  A
nd he fell in love with 
her.  And they were the biggest anti-Se mites.  Hi
s father– I told you that?   His father left a will, 
though his granddaughter was born al
ready Christian, that his gra
nddaughter cannot come  to his 
funeral.  That kind of a ma n she ma r r ied.  A
nd she was going to the Catholic Church and 
everything.  And they lived together there.  The 
parents had a separate part of the house and they 

lived together.  But when everything was happeni
ng, he didn™t save the parents.  He saved his 
wife and the daughter, but he didn™t
 save the parents, because he, 
himself, was an anti-Semite.  I 
know.  I know, because he ma de onc e a rema rk, that
 I coul dn™t believe it.  They had my stuff, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
26
 
 
because I left  it by Christian friends.  A lot 
of personal things.  And when my husband was 
transferred to Budapest, I told hi
m where the stuff is and he took it 
away and sent it to the sister.  
So whatever is saved, first they saved it, our frie
nds, but then my sister-in-law saved it.  So she 
had everything what was my dowry, my jewelr
y and everything.  So, he didn™t want it, you 
know, it was his.  He didn™t want to give it back
 to me .  And they said they don™t have it.  And 
one day they weren™t home  and I go to the clos
et and I pulled out ever
ything what was mi ne.  
That was the story.  So it was te
rrible, terrible, really terrible. 
 And I know that he ma de anti-
Se mitic remarks in front of me .  And I know that he was an anti-Semite. 
 

Q: What did he say?    

 

A: No, he ma de rema rks about my aunt, who was th
e loveliest, the best, best person in the world, 
my aunt.  And he said, ﬁThat 
Jewish woma n,ﬂ this way, about 
my aunt.  I don™t know what he 
said.  Said this and that.  This
 way to me , he is saying it about my aunt.  And I always had a 
feeling, because he was ma d that my  husband ma
rried me  and not a Christian.  He was, you 

know?   Until he met me, it took him I don™t 
know how long, when I was once there for a 
week–he took me  a week.  He took a chance, because
 he me t my train and at that time already 
they were looking for, not passpor
ts, but identifications.  And he 
took a chance and he took me  to 
meet his parents.  And him I me t, I don™t know. 
 He lived in the same  house.  And it was a 
Sunday when we went there and they came home 
from church, both of them.  And he  just, he 

came to the window I reme mber.  And he says
, ﬁHello,ﬂ through the 
window, you know?   I know 
that he was mad that he wants to marry me.   
 

Q: When you were in hiding, what did– how 
did you occupy your time?   Did you read books?   
What did you do? 
 
A: I don™t remember.  I went to my aunt many ti
me s, who had the 13-year-old boy, during the day.  
Because they lived in an other borough.  New Pe st, and it was 
Rakospolota
 
(ph )
, that was an 
other borough, they were, you know?   And I walked. 
 I reme mber I walked.  I was afraid to go 
by the street cars that they ask fo
r identification or some thing.  And I  walked.  I walked a lot.  
And I walked to her house and I tried to spend 
with my cousin– he was a lovely, lovely boy.  
And I really don™t know what I di
d the whole day.  I know when
 I was away my grandmother 
was very, very upset because she loved me  and 
they were bombing during the day.  And once I 
wasn™t there during the bombing and I had to r
un to a pharmacy to– that was our friends.  The 
woma n was my friend and the husband was a gyneco
logist.  And I ran to the pharmacy and I got 
to their baseme nt.  When it was over I went home
 and my grandmother was out of her mi nd.  She 
was so upset.  She wanted always hold my hands
, always.  And she almost died in my hands, 
because she lost her mi nd in the wagon, that™s for 
sure.  Because to say some thing like that, that 
ﬁ Would you please comb my hair? ﬂ   She didn™t know what™s happening.  And I didn™t know 

what™s happening, but I was very glad that sh
e doesn™t know what™s ha
ppening.  Such a smart 
woma n wha t  she was.  She didn™t even wear gl
asses and was reading th
e paper every day.  She 
knew about everything was going on in the world. 
 

Q: Were you following what was going 
on with the war at that time?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
27
 
 
A: Whatever they printed in H
ungarian papers, but not
hing else.  And we kn
ew.  We didn™t have 
correspondence with America.  It stopped, so I c
ouldn™t even write to my
 uncle.  Nothing.  I 
didn™t know nothing about him.  Ho
w is he doing?   What is he–?   We  knew in the beginning.  
We got a few letters from America.  And he sa
id, ﬁI™m trying to get 
your affidavit, that you 
should be able to come .ﬂ  And I even have those 
letters.  And we knew that he find a job in that 
pharmacy, the German pharmacy.  And they lived 
in the Bronx.  I know that.  And his address 
was always in my head, that I know, too.  All the 
time .  I wrote it in the dirt in Auschwitz, his 
address, that I shouldn™t forget it.
  In case, sometimes I can write 
to him.  Because it was, it was 
an unbelievable thing in Auschwitz, that you kne
w that you cannot get out from here, never.  
And still some thing was dictating to you, don™t forget
 that address.  It was such a mi xture, you 
know?   You knew that you are in a prison.  That 
you cannot get out from here.  And never, we 
never see the end, never saw the end 
of it, that we can get out from
 there.  And that woma n, that 
Romanian woman, maybe she was a Gypsy, I don™
t know.  She was dark complexion, who was 
reading there, too.  They were 
reading palms.  And I says, ﬁOkay, read my palms.ﬂ  One, it was 
before that, it was a private person when I went to
.  But that one, I went and says, ﬁDo it.ﬂ  And 
she said, ﬁYou are going to get out from here, 
and when you are going to get out from here, you 
will go for a very long trip overseas.  Your husband 
is alive, but he is in a hospital now.  He™s 
sick.ﬂ  And it was everything true what sh
e was telling me .  And she said, it was just 
unbelieva ble.  And she said, ﬁYou will ha ve thre
e children.ﬂ  And it was everythi ng true.  And 
you shouldn™t believe those things.  And it was 
everythi ng true, because I asked him, ﬁ Were you 

in the hospital? ﬂ  And he says, ﬁYes, with terri
bl e tonsillitis.ﬂ   In, 
near– no, it was already 
Hungary at that time , in Roma nia, it was Hungary 
and there he was near Bucharest.  They took it 
over, too.  And he was in the hospital from th
e labor camp, because he had very high fever and 
they put him in the hospital.  So it was true. 
 

Q: You described earlier on how you had been dati
ng this other young ma n and then you just me t 
your husband and that it was very quick.  And that
 you realized you were in love with the other 
young ma n.  Did you at some  point re
alize that you were in love 
with this ma n that you were 
engaged to?   And when did that happen? 
 

A: No.  I didn™t– I, well I saw him, I liked him, because he was ve ry good looking and very 
lovable.  But I was– until he  threw it out, I wa
s keeping the other guy™s pictur e always in my 
pocketbook.  That was an interesting thing.  Th
en when I found out that
 he is gone, then– but 
still I had it.  And once he found it and he was very
 jealous.  And I says, ﬁDon™t be jealous, he™s 
not alive anymore.ﬂ  But I don™t 
know.  You see, when I came back and I me t hi m, and I knew 
that he knew that I am alive.  Because they kne
w I am alive.  I told them, that they send to 

everywherename s from Bergen-Belsen.  Eisenhower,
 the United States.  So, he knew that I am 
alive.  I didn™t know he was alive.
  And it was a very, to me  it was 
like a very strange thing, that I 
have a husband, you know?   I have to now get to know
 hi m.   I was two weeks with him.  He got 
two weeks furlough and he had to go back when 
we got ma rried in 1944.  February, when I was 
24 years old.  We  got married and after two week
s– everybody said to hi
m, ﬁYou a r e absolutely 
out of your mi nd to get ma rried in those times.ﬂ  Bu
t he didn™t want to te
ll the whole story, that I 
need another name.  So he came from Romania 
and we got ma rried, but the day when I was 24 
years old, and–

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interv iew with Emilie Szekely.  So, let™s backtrack a little 
bit, you, you needed to get, you wanted to ge
t– was your ma in motivation to get ma rried 
because you needed another name? 
 
A: –.a different name. 

 

Q: So it wasn™t necessarily that you were 
in love with your husband at that point? 
 

A: I didn™t know hi m.  He was in labor camp and I 
was with my  grandmother.  I absolutely didn™t 
know hi m.  I went with him about three weeks, when we got engaged and then they took him 

away.  And he was ma dl y in love with me .  A
nd I then I said, God, who knows whether he will 
stay with me ?   He will go through that.  I don™t 
know what™s going to happen with me .  He had 
his parent s still then.  For three more years he ha
d his parent s, because they were killed in 1944.  
I says what are his parents going 
to say to it and that kind of a business, you know?   I didn™t 
know.   
 

Q: Did you have any kind of false pa
pers at all before you got married? 

 

A: False papers?   No.  I 
got the papers late.  I ha
ve it here, Christian birth 
certificate. Because when 
he came to the ghetto, I think somewhere it™s there 
that a day before, when we were in the ghetto, 
and one day he come s to the ghetto and I almost 
fainted.  I says, ﬁWhat are you doing here? ﬂ   He 
said, ﬁWe were just transferred to Budapest.  Th
e company was transferred to Budapest and I am 
not with them because I am driving a horse and ca
rriage.  I am in a private house with the horse 
and you come right away with me and my sister
 is going to send you a Ch
ristian birth certificate 
and until then you are going to stay with me  there.
  You stay where I stay
 with the horse.  And 
during the day, I don™t know.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁWhere is
 it?ﬂ  He says, ﬁNot far away from here,ﬂ  
he said.  I said, ﬁWell if it™s not far away from
 he re, why can™t you come  tomorrow, that I should 
put some thing together, some  clothes?ﬂ  And he ju
st didn™t wa nt to leav
e, and he says, ﬁOkay,ﬂ 
he said, ﬁbut I must tell you some thing.  If so
me body wants to get– put you in a train, don™t let 

you do it.ﬂ  They saw it, when they came  alrea
dy, what™s happening in the country.  I didn™t 
know what he meant.  When I learned what he 
meant, we were pushed by the Nazis with the 
machine guns, so how can you not let yourself, you 
know?   So he didn™t know either how is it, 
how they do it.  But he said, ﬁDon™t,ﬂ anyway.  So he left. 
 

Q: Well, let™s get to that story a little later, a
nd go chronologically and stay back at the time and tell 
me about the time, how it happened 
that you and Ferenz got ma rried. 
 

A: When we got married? 

 

Q: Uhhuh. 

 

A: He came home  for two weeks– 

 

Q: You were telling it off the tape, but tell it on the tape. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
29
 
 
 
A: Oh, oh, oh.  So he came home , he got two week
s furlough and everybody was telling him that he 
was crazy to get ma rried in those times.  But he
 didn™t want to tell the whole story to everybody, 
that I need another name  to survive.  We thought 
that I need another name
 to survive.  And we 
found a Justice of Peace, who, when
 I was 24 years old, that day, we got married, because before 
then I couldn™t get ma rried.  Only when you are 24 
years old without father™s consent.  And they 
changed my father™s bi rth certificate to Roma nia,
 instead of Russia.  And so he was covered.  
And he ma rried us.  And my aunt, we had two wi
tnesses, one was a distant relative and I don™t 
even know who was the other witness.
  I have to read it from the 
certificate.  I don™t know.  And 
we got ma rried.  And my  aunt ma de a big dinner fo
r the family.  And they send us to the city, to 

a very nice hotel.  And we went 
to the hotel and I was just ve
ry, very afraid because they 
constantly we re checking on people and asking for 
their identifications.  And especially at night 
when we we nt down to eat.  And I says, ﬁI cannot 
swallow, I can™t.  I™m so afraid here,ﬂ so, but 
we stayed there overnight.  And next day we le
ft and it wasn™t too far away from my c ousin 
where I me t my father.  That hotel
 wasn™t too far away.  And I re
me mber that we went to that 
cousin, to his wife.  He didn™t know my husba
nd.  And they didn™t come  e ven to the we dding 
because it was in Budapest, that was in outskirts 
and they were already ve ry bad time s, so it was 
no traveling.  So I introduced him.  I spend ther
e about, we spent a day there.  And then we went 
back to my grandmother™s house and we stayed th
ere for two weeks, until he stayed there.  And 
then he left.  And I stayed with my grandmother,
 later, not with my grandmother, but with my 
aunt, because she had the much bigger house.  
So, we stayed with my aunt, not with my 

grandmother when we stayed.  It was with my
 aunt.  And I stayed with my aunt, too.   
 

Q: With your aunt Ilona? 

 

A: Ilona, with her.  The other one, the other 
aunt, she was a widow and I don™t know.  We  didn™t 
even go on one train with her.  Some how she went with his aunt, with my  husband™s aunt, 

together on a train.  She wasn™t 
with us.  Only Ilona, my gra
ndmother, my  uncle™s sister, my 
uncle™s sister™s husband, they 13-
year-old, two 13-year-old boys, 
then the four years old boy and 
my uncle™s brother™s wife with th
e four-years-old boy.  We
 were together in one train.  That part 
of the fa mily, but the rest of 
the family, they were in anothe
r wagon, not in that, you know?   My 
grandmother™s sisters, because they were all 
there, but not in the same  wagon.  We  we re 80 
people in one.  So. 
 

Q: But before that you started living, you desc
ribed how you we re moving fr om house to house and 
then you started living with your aunt full time? 
 

A: Withmyaunt. 

 

Q: Can you say some thing about that? 

 

A: Full time , the third year, my aunt said, ﬁIt™s 
enough.  It seems they are not looking for you.  It 
was enough, you are our child.  You will stay with 
us.ﬂ  And I stayed with them.  Once I was 
very, very sick, my pulse went up to 160.  And th
ey called their doctor.  And the treatme nt was 
so different that time .  I reme mber that I was in
 bed and they rented from a me dical supply store 
a big, big bottle what was full with
 ice-cold water and it had tubes 
in it.  And that tube was put

on my chest, on my heart and the water was circula
ting in it.  That was the treatment.  And that 
was– I thought it was a heart attack, because it di
dn™t want  to go out.  For three weeks it didn™t 
go down, the pulse.  And then I had another thin
g in 1942, that was terr
ible too.  I had the 
appendix taken out and I couldn™t 
have it done under my na me .  Ididn™t go to the hospital.  And 
I went with my mother™s, with my
 mother™s oldest sister, whose s
on was in Siberia.  And I went 
under her name  to the hospital.  It was a privat
e hospital.  And the docto
r was a private doctor, 
who, he was a gynecologi st.  Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain 
and pain and he just couldn™t find out what is it
.  And one day my husband 
was there visiting.  It 
wasn™t my husband at that time .  And I just wa
s like in two, I had such
 a pain.  And his office 
was in my, my grandmother, where my grandmot
her lived, in that house 
was his office.  And I 
went to him and I said, ﬁI tell you the diagnosis.  
I tell you what I have.ﬂ 
 He says, ﬁWhat, what 
are you talking about? ﬂ   I said, ﬁThat must be 
appendix.ﬂ  And he says, ﬁGod, you are right.ﬂ  
And he took me  to a private hosp
ital to Budapest and they started to operate on me .  And it was 
under my aunt™s name.  I was Halas 
(ph )
.  That™s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada.  And I 
went under that name .  And the operation was so long, they didn™t know what happened there, 

that the doctors are running for more anesthesia. 
 And my aunt is sta
nding there and didn™t know 
what happened.  My appendix was 
co mpletely, co mpletely curled 
up with my colons and it was a 
very, very long operation.  And my
 heart, it was weak.  They took 
me home by a mbulance after.  
But next mo rning, six o™clock in the morning, the 
doctor is there.  And 
he lived, that was in 
Budapest, in the city, the hospital.  And we lived 
in New Pest, so it was a big distant.  I says, ﬁI 
am so sick that you are here? ﬂ   He says, ﬁN
o, no, don™t worry.  I just wanted to know how you 
feel.ﬂ  Then I found out what was happening and 
they had to take me  home by a mbulance.  And 
it was in ‚42.  And in ‚44 I have an unusual bi
g cut and that™s how I went to Mengele.  So I 
thought that that will ma tter when he sees that. 
 But you know what was interesting?  That I had 
a friend, she was a woman, who had a ma stectomy 
and she survived.  And Mengele saw it and 
she survived.  So they were very odd things.  
And she came to Canada and she died in Canada.  
It was a terrible thing.  Her s
on is an engineer.  He and my 
cousin, in Hungary, they we nt 
together to the– they started the engineering colle
ge together.  Her son a
nd my cous in, who is in 
Canada, that lady™s son.  And they lived in Montr eal.  And my cousin lived in Montreal at the 
beginning.  He went to McGill 
(ph) 
to finish his degree.  And we 
went to visit her, the lady, and 
she was alive for a few years.  And once her son 
had to go to Paris, to Fr ance for business.  I 
don™t know what kind of engineer is he, because mi
ne is a chemical engineer.  I don™t know what 
kind of engineer he– and while he was away, she 
got the pneumonia and she died.  They had to 

call him home.  She lived togeth
er with the son and with da
ughter-in-law.  She ma rried a 
Hungarian girl.  He wasn™t Jewish.  She was Je
wish, the woman.  Her husband wasn™t Jewish, so 
the son wasn™t Jewish.  So she ma rried a Hungari
an, non-Jewi sh girl, who was already in Canada 
at that time .  And she spoke perfect French a
nd she worked for the telephone company.  Very 
nice person.  We went there three 
times to visit her.  And for l
ongest time, they couldn™t– he 
retired.  They couldn™t sell their 
house.  And two years ago they wr
ote me  a letter, ﬁFinally we 
sold the house and we moved to Kingston.ﬂ  It™s 
Canada, but it™s very close to the border.  And 
it™s a beautiful place.  
And they live there.  They have 
two children.  And he said, ﬁMy son 
ma rried a French woma n with a daughter.ﬂ  Th
e son.  A French woma n, who has a daughter.  
And the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she 

was a prem
ature baby.  And she was very small, 
so they didn™t know that she survive.  She 
survived and she went to college  and then she became the hostess on the Canadian Cruise Li ne, 

for– I don™t know how long she did it.  They were
 always– every Christma s they wr ite me  and

I write them.  That™s how I know about them.  But 
when they lived in Montreal, they went, ma ny 
times, my c ousin and they were friends.  But si
nce that time, I know only from Christmas cards 
what is happening to them.  A
nd what™s interesting, my cousin™s
 son went to McGill, too.  And 
they live in Toronto.  But they st ayed there and he
 went to McGill.  And he fi nished psychiat ry.  
And he wants to– I don™t know how they are doingit, it™s not a bad idea– be a lawyer and a 
psych, psychologist, psychologist an
d a lawyer.  So, he™s going to law school in Kingston, where 
they live now.  You know.  The father™s friends
.  He™s going to Kingston,
 to law school.  It™s 
interesting.  I don™t know whether they see each 
other.  I don™t know what he was writing me  
about it.  I ha ve to call them Sunday, I don™t kno
w.  I call Sundays only because it is cheaper. 
 

Q: Tell me , going back to wartime, where were yo
u on the day, or do you reme mber the day that the 
Germans invaded Budapest in March of 1944?   
 

A: Yes, of course, of course. 

 

Q: Can you describe that day? 

 

A: Oh, that was horrible.  I was in my grandm
other™s house and we– we 
didn™t have televisions 
that time.  We just had radios.  We  didn™t have
 televisions.  We just heard it on the radio, and 
how do we see it?  Because we saw them marchi
ng in.  And I don™t reme mber how did we see it, 
because we didn™t ha ve televisions.  But I know a
nd I see with my eyes how they ma r c hed into 
Budapest and where they stopped in the mi ddle wh
ere it is divided, the Danube divides the city, 
you know?   Into two parts.  And they stop ther
e, and right a way the Hungarian Army, right 
away, they went to greet them, and cater them, a
nd did whatever they wa nt even more.  Because 
they would never find out nothing if
 those countries wouldn™t help them, what they occupied.  
Because they, who, which German knew for instance,
 that my sister-in-law was ma r r ied, that she 
was once Jewish?   Who knew it?   Only the Hungar
ians who live there and 
they went and told on 
them.  That here is a couple who was ma rrie
d, converted and who was 
ma rried to– and then 
they came, the Germans and the Hungarians together
 to look for her.  They did it themselves, the 
Hungarians, and they did it, I™m sure, in ev
ery country.  Otherwise 
how would the Germans 
know whom to take, who was the 
rich ma n, whom to call to the 
departme nt, to their offices, 
whatever, and tortur e them?  How would they kn
ow?  Because they help
 them.  Because they 
were anti-Semites.  We  didn™t know. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you some thing kind of funny, questi
on.  How did you feel a
bout being Jewish?    
 

A: Klingel 
(ph)
. 
 

Q: Oh, the last name ?    

 

A: You know, I™m constantly thinking about it, si
nce I™m talking to you.  You know the boy™s name . 
 

Q: What was it again?  

 

A: Klingel. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

Q: And his first name  was Nicholas.   
 

A: And he had a nickname , Mitza 
(ph )
.  Was very, very good looking.  I think he was the best-
looking Jewi sh boy in the city.  Ve
ry nice boy.  Very nice, respectf
ul, very, very nice.  And the 
parents, that™s interesting, too. 
 That they moved then, after th
e war they moved to Prague, the 
parents and the sister.  And my friend, 
who is now in Brooklyn, whose husband was a 

dermatologist, her children went, she gave them 
lessons, piano lessons.  Hi s sister gave them 
piano lessons.  And they were saying it, I shou
ld have known that he would ma rry me .  Can you 
imagine?   That™s what they were saying, the parent
s.  And he was telling me , that he cannot talk 
about ma rriage, because he is working for his father.  He is not on his own.  And then they blame 

me , that I should have known.  We  never spoke a
bout ma rriage, only that one time he said that 
ﬁI™m not talking about ma rriage, because, until I 
am not on my own.ﬂ  You know?   Probably they 

were against me .  I wasn™t a wealthy girl.  And sh
e went with a– she left a girl for me , who was 
a bank director™s daughter, very wealthy daughter, 
very wealthy girl.  And he went with her and 
she left her because of me .  And 
then the parent s were saying, my friend was telling me , that they 
were– the sister was telling it, 
that I should have known.  Wh at di
d they know what went on?   I 
was introduced to his sister once.
  I didn™t want it.  I was, 
I didn™t want– I don™t know.  And 
once he went to swim in the summer and there is
 his sister.  And he di
d it by purpose, that she 
should know me , the sister.  And one day then, be
fore he went away to, I don™t know where, the 
army.  And he left a book with me
 a nd I didn™t finish it.  And he said, ﬁYou bring it back to my 

mother.ﬂ  I was shaking, you know?  I was never in their house and I was shaking.  And I was so 

clumsy that I went upstairs, and she was very nice
 to me .  And in the hallway and I gave her the 
book.  And she was very nice and I was so nervous 
that I– she had some  kind of a flower pot 
and I pushed it with my hand.  [Laughing.]  It broke.  It was terrible.  It was very uncomfortable 

to meet them, because I had always a feeling th
at they are against me .  You know?   He would 
never, never say to me  that, but I had a feeling th
at the parents were against me , because I wasn™t 
in their category.  And she left that girl, w
ho was wealthy, because of me  and that was my 
feeling about them.   
 

Q: Did you think about him a lot?   Afterwar
ds when you were in hiding, for example? 

 

A: When I was hiding?   About him?  
 I already knew that he™s dead. 
 

Q: When did you find out? 

 

A: 1942.  In 1942 I found out through friends from
 Uzhorod, that all that
, I don™t know how ma ny 
friends together there went.  They took them to
 Russia.  And that ma ybe they killed them the 
same  way as  my parents.  I don™t know.  They 
put them on the trains and they were in labor 
camp and that they were killed in 1942.  I rea
lly didn™t know about to wh
om first, you know?   To 
think about my parents, to think about him, 
to think about my husband, my future husband.  I 
really didn™t know.  I was terribly mi xed up, terr
ibly.  And always worried, terribly worried.  
That fear was unbelievable, that
 now they are going to get me , 
now they are going to– because I 
saw what they are doing.  If 
you didn™t wear the star, for instan
ce, the Hungarian knew you.  And 
that was only in ‚44, when we had to start to wear the star, when the Germans ca me  i n.  But still, 

if you, I didn™t look Jewish, I co
uld have gone wherever, but they
 knew me  and they could tell it 
to please the Germans.

Q: Did you think about being Jewish? 

 

A:  That time?   I knew I was Jewish.  I couldn™t 
think different way.  I kne
w that I was Jewish.  I 
knew that I am in trouble with all other Jews. 
 

Q: Didyou–? 

 

A: I never thought about converting. 
 It wouldn™t help me .  Conversi
on.  It wouldn™t help me .  But I 
found lately, I found that Christian– I don™t evenknow whether I told George, because the last 

time when my husband went to HungaryŠhe wentma ny times when he was retiredŠhe went to 

Hungary because his sister was very sick for years a
nd he said, ﬁI want to see my sister.ﬂ  But his 
excuse was, because we had two 
little children buried there, he 
went to the grave.  And I was 
saying always, ﬁFrank, they are in our hearts, thos
e are only stones.ﬂ  I c
ouldn™t say he wants to 
see the grave.  He wants to have it redone, the lett
ers if they were in bad 
shape or whatever.  But 
his sister, he had that only sist
er and she was very, very sick, but her son-in-law was a doctor and 
he kept him alive, her alive.  And he was tel
ling me , ﬁIf not me , she would be dead ten years 
ago.ﬂ  I think she had cancer of the liver, because
 on the end they had to operate on her.  And I 
saw her, the last time I saw her, 
that summer in ™89, and January she died.  And we came back in 
1990, January.  They had to– she became yellow and 
he couldn™t help her anymore.  But he was 

telling me himself, if not me– because my ni
ece was unbelievable.  She called hi m fr om every 
meeting and everywhere, ﬁCome right away beca
use mother has fever,ﬂ and right away the 
injection.  Unbelievable.  She was a very 
good daughter.  And I was surprised how he was 
talking to him over the phone.  I says, ﬁMarie,ﬂ her name  is Anna Maria, ﬁeverybody can hear 

you.ﬂ  ﬁI don™t care.  My mother 
come s first,ﬂ and that kind of a 
thing.  So, he kept her alive, 
really.  My husband went to see 
her every year, and that year 
when he went, in ‚82, in ‚81, 
February, he had a heart attack, and he lived 17 m
onths.  And in ‚82, June, he says, ﬁI™m going to 
see my sister.ﬂ  And I spoke, I knew that three-qu
arter of his heart was gon
e.  And I spoke to his 
doctor, I says, ﬁWhat should I do?   How shall I te
ll him that he cannot go
? ﬂ   He says, ﬁYou know 
what, he can go.  He has a doctor there.  He will be  safe.  But he cannot go rowing around 

nowhere in Europe.  He goes to one place and he can go.  And June 13
th
 is his birthday, but I 
called him ma ny ti me s.  But I called hi
m on his birthday.  I™m sorry, June 17
th
.  He was born, 
1913, 17.  And I called him and he says, ﬁI feel wonde
rful.  I feel very good,ﬂ and I always gave 
the report to the doctor, because he was from th
e same hospital were I worked, the doctor.  And 
he says, ﬁYes, he has around him 
more sick people than he is, so
 he™s feeling fine.ﬂ  And he 
came home  and every first of July, we went out 
to the country house.  They were there already, 
here in 1979.  And we met there and I spend one
 week vacation there, because Ilona was born 
third of July.  And we spend her birthday.  And 
my husband came  back end of June to spend the 
week in the country for her birthda
y.  And after that, we supposed
 to go to Canada, all of us by 
car.  And he said, ﬁYou know what?  
 I came from a big trip.  You go with them to Canada.ﬂ  And 
she was pregnant with Anna that time.  She wa s 
pregnant with Anna, Ilona.  She knew that he 
wanted, because he always wanted children and th
e two died.  He always wanted children, so at 
least George should have more child
ren.  So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada.  
He said, ﬁYou go to Canada and I go home .ﬂ  A
nd he was alone, traveling 
home.  And then I got 
a call from him in Canada that please bring a pres
ent to one of my co-workers.  I says, ﬁ Why to 
her?ﬂ  She sa ys, ﬁBecause I was sick and she took me  to the hospital.ﬂ  So we packed and we

came right back.  He was a few days in Intensiv
e Care or in Coronary Care, I don™t know what 
happened.  He didn™t feel well.  And August 12
th
, August 12
th
, he died.  And I wasn™t home.  I 
was working and after work I went to the dentis
t and I had to have a tooth pulled.  And he was 
very upset about that and he came with me .  I 
went by bus.  They had private buses, because I 
went to the city periodontist.  And he came to
 the door and he looked so beautiful.  He  had 
brown pants and a yellow shirt on.  And he said
, ﬁNothing, nothing hurts me ,ﬂ because he had 
back trouble, too.  He had a spine operation. 
 He said, ﬁNothing, nothi
ng hurts me .ﬂ  And you 
know, you don™t think if it™s about your own, that
 the last day when 
you live, nothing will hurt 
you.  And that™s true.  But you just don™t th
ink.  And I™m so happy that he said it–

Q: –Szekely, took a little br eak for a few weeks ther
e.  And now I wanted to just ask you, because 
I was reviewing the interview that we did last ti
me and going over it, I had 
a couple of questions.  
And one of them was, right at 
the beginning you were talking about
 the cousin of yours, who was 
the painter, who lived in Odessa
.  And I wanted to ma ke clear, 
was it his daughter that came  over 
and stayed with you?   It wa
s his daughter?   Okay.   
 

A: It was his daughter that came  over and st
ayed with us.  We  had an apartment here. 
 

Q: You told the whole story, so I don™t want you to go through that again.  But I just wanted to 
clarify– 
 

A: It was my c ousin™s, my father™s brother™s daughter and her family.  And he, himself, lives in 
Boston. 
 

Q: Okay.  Did he come  ove r at the same  time as her? 

 

A: No, no.  He came over five years ago, six years a
go because he is a citizen already, so it has to be 
five years ago.  He became  citizen last year, ‚
99.  So, five years ago, because he came  with his 
sister and sister™s family.  
Husband only, sister™s daughter an
d husband, because the husband had 
the parents there.  And they al
ways, he and his sister lived al
ways together and a niece and a 
husband.  So he belonged with them.  I couldn™t 
bring him, because only you could bring parent s 
or sisters or  brothers.  So, he went with them because he lived with them and he had his son– 

it™s not brother-in-law actually, because his hus
band– they had the parents there already, and 
through them.  That™s why he didn™t come  here.  Bu
t his aim was if his daughter is here and their 
fa mily is there, everybody to be in Ke nt
ucky together.  That™s what he wanted. 
 

Q: And tell me  what his full name  is. 

 

A: He is, Isislav 
(ph ) 
Klugman.  That was my maiden name.   
 

Q: I see, so he was your father™s brother. 

 

A: My father™s brother™s son.   

 

Q: Okay, and we, last time we were going over 
mos tly some  questions about your childhood and 
some things that weren™t covered in the inte
rview that the Shoah Foundation did.  And what I 
wanted to do mostly today is to talk about your
 experiences after the wa
r, after the war ended.  
But one of the things that wasn™t clear to me  fr
om the Shoah Foundation inte
rview was, tell me  if 
I have this right, when you were on the transpor
ts from Hungary to Auschwitz, you were with 
your grandmother and your Aunt Ilona. 
 

A: With my Aunt Ilona and other au
nts, too and her son.  My mo ther 
had four sisters, so I was with 
three of them.  But the closest was to me  alwa
ys Ilona, because when they took my mother and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
36
 
 
they killed them in, my parent
s in 1941.  So, she was the one 
who was unbelievably helping me .  
And then the last  year, be fore the Nazis came 
in, she didn™t let me  go to hiding and she said, 
ﬁYou are our child, no matter what.  You stay with 
us.ﬂ  And so for one year I was with them 
until they took us all.  And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but 
not her son.  And my son was born. 
 To my son she was like a grandmother.  So when we left, 
we left to Vienna and we left them in Hungar
y, but we knew that they are comi ng after us, three 
weeks.  Because they had, they were elderly people already and they ha
d visa to Israel and 
England and we knew that they are going to come
.  And the time came then we came to America 
and we left them there.  And my son, he was 
so blaming me  and he was so crying.  How can I do 

it, to leave them there?  He wa
s nine years old.  He was the only relative whom he knew.  Like, 
she took care of him when I had to go to work. 
 Because under the communism we ha d to work.  
And she was everything to him.  And my hear
t was going out and I was explaining to him, 
ﬁ When we get to America and we become  citizens we are going to bring–ﬂ and that was the 

plan, that we are going to bring them over.  
But she died, unfortunately, fr om a gall bladder 
operation.  But I think that she had already 
liver cancer, but they 
don™t tell me , because nobody 
dies from a gall bladder operation.  It must ha
ve gone to the liver and the operation was okay.  
She was alive for a few days.  And one day my un
cle and his brother went 
to visit her.  They 
went every day, but one day when they went, she 
was dead.  I didn™t go, to 
the funeral.  Because 
we were here in ‚58 and that was in ‚63 and in ‚59 I got a job in the hospital when I was working 

and I says, ﬁWe don™t have either the money for th
e three of us to go,ﬂ so we couldn™t go.  But it 
was in the summertime and George was with some
 of our friends in the country.  They were 
having a bungalow they rented a
nd we went over on the weekends.  We  went to Poughkeepsie.  
And he was there and I was afraid to tell him.  
I was afraid to tell him.  And he wrote to his 
pediatrician in New York, who was the head of th
e Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and 
asked him to find out from me  the trut h, because  he
 thinks that some thing is very wrong.  And he 
showed me  the letter and he said, ﬁYou have to tell him.ﬂ  So, I was very, very
 upset to tell him.  
And I found it out, my husband did, he
 got the letter and he didn™t wa
nt to tell me .  And we are 
driving out to the country and when he told me , we ma de an accident  with the car.  I was, you 

know, so upset, we ma de– and it wa s an old car and 
we had the first car.  It was a big Pontiac.  
But some body ran into us.  It wasn™t our fault, 
and he ran away.  The guy ran away.  But I was so 
upset that how I am going to tell him, because 
it was like the end of the world.  He didn™t know 
no one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brot her, my uncle™s brother 

lost his four-years-old child and 
the second wife never could have 
children.  So he™s name d after 
my, Ilika™s son, he was George, too.  And he 
was everybody™s child, only child.  And when I had 
the other little boy, he was five mont hs old when
 he died.  I name d hi m a f ter the four-years-old, 
who died.  He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup.   
 

Q: At one point in Auschwitz, you told in your
 interview with the Shoah Foundation about how you 
arrived in Auschwitz and how you were there for,
 I think two weeks before you were given your 
tattoo and before you started working.  
When we re you separated from Ilona? 
 

A: Three weeks later.  She was, when we went to
 the barracks, she was put in the next barracks.  
Because they put 60 people in one and she would be
 the 61.  So she was put in the next barrack.  
But when I came back from work, they didn™t ge
t food, those people who didn™t work and I gave 
them my hal f of the bread and I dressed them 
up.  I™m saying ﬁthem,ﬂ she was there with one of

her friends, who had two twin sons and they are 
alive.  They went thr
ough all the– I told you 
that, no? 
 
Q: No. 

 

A: No?   She had two twin sons, her friend and th
ey went through all, a
ll the experiments with 
Mengele.  They are alive.  They are in Israel.  
One is in high– he has, I don™t know what kind of 
position, but they are not me n.  They
 cannot get ma rried, that™s what 
they did to them.  And I met 
them when I  was in 1976, I was in Israel.  And 
that was one– we went to restaurant and my 
uncle™s brother was there with his second wife, w
ho is alive and she is in Vienna.  She ma rried 
him when George was born, the second wife.  
And she was much younger than he was.  He 
wanted children and she couldn™t have children.  Wh
en we went to the re
staurant then, I didn™t 
know what™s the surprise.  My aunt™s friend wa
s there with her husband and she said she would 
never forget it, what I did for them.  B
ecause they were naked.  I was, but my 
aufseren
 (
ph)
 and 
the forewoman, she let me take out clothes, because 
I told her that my aunt is in the next camp.  
And  she let me  take out clothes.  And I dresse
d them and I gave them food.  And one day when 
Mengele came  to the camp and he was sorting out
, because he came every week and sorting out 
people.  We  had to get undressed and walk arou
nd him.  He had a stick in his hand and he™s 
pointing one here, one there and 
I was one here.  I knew I go back.  And she was on the other 

side and I didn™t know what happened to her.  
I thought she goes to gas.  I didn™t know about 
nothing else.  And I knew that that™s gas there.  It 
turned out that they took her to Ther esienstadt  
with her friend.  And they were working at an a
mmunitions factory and at 
night they stayed at 
Theresienstadt.  And only when I went back, I knew
 that she is alive.  And she was everything to 
me .  
 

Q: Why don™t we jump for ward to that time, becau
se you described the rest of that experience in 
your Shoah Interview.  And then you, so after th
e war eventually you returned to Budapest and 
you were reunited with your, with your Aunt Ilon
a and your husband.  Talk more about that time, 
talk about the reunions with those people a
nd how you were feeling and what your thoughts 
were. 
 

A: I came, I think that™s in it, when I came  to 
our station, people were standi ng there and waiting for 
people to come , because in whole Europe they 
we re waiting for people to come  because they 
knew who is alive, because Eisenhower– that I 
said, that he ma de a list from everybody and 
send it to the places where they came from.  So, t hey
 knew I am alive after liberation, but I didn™t 
know about no one.  And when we got to our st
ation, I saw there are ma ny people and I didn™t 
know no one.  I was shaking and I we nt to one of them and I says, ﬁExcuse me , do you know 

some one by the name  of Eugene Schwartz? ﬂ   An
d he started to scream and he says, ﬁYou are 
Emilie? ﬂ   I sa ys, ﬁHow do you know it? ﬂ   He sa ys
, ﬁYour uncle is waiting for you every day.  He 
was here today, too, but he had to go for some  ki
nd of a business.ﬂ  I says, ﬁBusiness? ﬂ  It was 
October fifth, ™45, and they were liberated in 
April already.  And he says, ﬁI™m going to phone 
him.ﬂ  And I  says, ﬁTelephones? ﬂ  You know.  So, he came in ten mi nutes.  ﬁHe has even a car,ﬂ 

she said, he said.  And I knew th
at he doesn™t drive.  He had a chauffeur.  They were very 
wealthy people before the war.  And they starte
d to pull themselves together.  And he came and 
we were just, we couldn™t talk.  We  were cryi
ng and crying and crying.  He
 loved me  very much 
and he was just crying.  And fi
nally when we stopped crying, di
dn™t stop, but we could talk, he

said, ﬁYour aunt is alive, but not
 my son.ﬂ  But I knew that 13 y
ears old wouldn™t be alive.  I had 
one of my uncles, my mother™s brother, that
 was the only ma n in the family, who was never 
married because my grandmother was 35 years ol
d when she was a widow and left with five 
children.  And he didn™t get married because he
 was supporting the family and he wanted the 
girls to get married and probabl
y– but he was never ma rried.  He
 was 54 years old.  And he was 
in labor camp in Hungary, but at 
the last mi nute when the Germans left, they manage d to take 
him and he was in Buchenwald.  And he was aliv
e.  And they all lived together when I came 
back.  And he came– 
 

Q: Who all lived together?   What was the whole group? 

 

A: My– Ilika, her husband– 

 

Q: I™m sorry, say the first one again, because the mi ke– 

 

A: Illie, Illie, Illie, 
Ilona, Ilona, Ilona.  Ilona
, her husband, his brother– 
 

Q: Give everybody™s name s, if you would please? 

 

A: Laszlo, Laszlo was his name – Laszlo is Vlad
islav– I don™t know what is 
Laszlo in English.  I 
have no idea. 
 

Q: That™sokay. 

 

A: Laszlo.  And my uncle, Joseph, they all lived to
gether, because his brot her wasn™t married yet.  
He lost his wife and four-years-old child.  My 
uncle™s brother wasn™t ma rried.  And they live, 
they lived, before the war, it was a beautiful ne
w house.  And the two fami lies, my uncle and his 
brother lived in one house, two ex
act, the same apartments, the most mo dern.  And the German 
soldiers were in it when they came back and they
 ruined the whole house.  So they had to re-do 
it.  So, they lived next door, was my uncle™s pa
rents™ house.  And they 
lived– that was an older 
house, and they lived in that apartment in his 
parent™s apartment, my uncle™s.  And then we 
came, I ca me back, and my husband.  I think 
it is there how I met my hus band when I came 
back.  Okay, so we stayed there, but only for a 
few days because it was no room for us.  So we 
went to Eger, to his sister, what is another cit
y.  It is about, I don™t 
know how ma ny mi les away.  
It was a very nice town.  I knew that town before
 the war, because I went to visit his mother 
there, his family, his mo ther and father, who liv
ed already with his sister, who was converted.  
That story is in there, no? 
 

Q: You me ntioned, you talked about the sister la
st time , last time we 
were here, his sister. 
 

A: Okay.  His parents lived ther
e.  And part of the house was 
my husband™s house, because that 
house was inherited.  And there were
 other relatives there from that part of the fa mily and they 
wanted the part of the house.  And they shouldn™
t get it.  My husband paid
 it out.  So a part, it 
was a very big house, it was his.  So we had like 
a separate apartment, but together with them.  
The kitchen was together, but we had two room
s and after the two rooms was the big dining 
room what separated us.  And in that apartmen
t his parents live d, because they took away their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

far ms.  They were big farmers, not in Eger, it wa
s in another city, I mean village.  And they took 
away everything from them.  They took away, it™s 
interesting, fi rst the Romanians before, after 
the first war, they took away, then the Russian
s took away.  The Germans took away.  So, they 
went back and forth and on the end, the Germans.  When the Germans took away, they had to 
leave.  And they let them leave 
and they left to their sister a
nd their daughter.  
And their son-in-
law couldn™t save them, but he saved his 
family, my sister-in-
law and his daughter. 
 

Q: I have a few questions about that time.  One,
 did you have any hope at all that your parents and 
your sister were alive? 
 

A: Hope?   No. After Auschwitz, no, but before Ausc
hwitz, I thought that th
ey must be some where 
alive.  And when we we nt to Auschwitz I t
hought we go some where, where I™m going to meet 
them.  I had no idea.  I think I said it then, that 
once I went to a fortune te
ller, I said it, and they 
said that my  parents are alive, but they are very 
far away.  And it turned out that  they were really 
alive when I found it out from the Museum.  Because
 I thought after I came back that they were 
killed right away in June, July, when they took them.  August 24
th
 they were killed, according to 
the Museum.  And they showed me  pictures and 
where they took them.  And they knew about it.  
30, what did they say, 130?   I don™t know how
 many.  How ma ny peopl e, one day they were 
killed, because they were not only from Czechoslova
kia, that part where we lived, but they were 
from Roma nia, what belonged once to Hungary, 
where Elie Wi esel comes from.  They were 
people from there, too.  And they 
were there, too.  So they were, I think, 38,000 in one day they 
killed.  Because they took them to Poland firs
t, no, I know from them. 
 And they didn™t know 
what to do with them because all the Polish pe
ople were in the ghettos and they didn™t know 

what to do with them.  That™s why they were killed.   
 

Q: Can you tell me  when and how you found out wh
at had actually happened to your parents? 
 

A: Actually I found out in 1948, because one of 
my first cousins was taken in 1941 to– we didn™t 
know where.  They took him from the street in
 1941.  He was an engineer.  And he just 
disappeared.  And in 1948, he came back from Sibe
ria.  And when he came  back and we me t, 
that was my first cousin, my mother™s sister™sson, and when he came back, he asked me, ﬁWhere 

are your parents?   What happened 
to your parents? ﬂ  And I was tel
ling him that I have no idea.  I 
got a card from my sister from Ka menetz Podolski 
(ph )
 and she™s writing, ﬁ We are here.  We  
don™t know what are we going to do.  When do we 
get an apartment or something to eat.  We 

have no idea.ﬂ  And the card had a Hungarian stam
p on it, so I assume  that she sent it with a 
soldier, a Hungarian soldier, 
back.  And from then on I didn
™t know nothing.  And then my 
cousin was telling me , ﬁ My God, I was there wh
en those people were killed.  I was on a horse 
and carriage.ﬂ  He was in– he went to underg
round with the Russians.  And how, I don™t know 
up to today, how he was riding a horse
 and carriage, and he was there, he said.  He saved a lot of 
people.  He put them under the hay.  He had no id
ea that my parents were there.  That was the 

first when I knew how they were killed, in 1948.  And I was back 1945 already from 

concentration camp.  And I still 
didn™t know what was happening. 
 

Q: During those three years then, before you f
ound out and after you got back did you make any 
effort to find out what had happened to them?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
40
 
 
A: I didn™t know where.  We became right away 
communists.  In 1948 we were communi sts.  I 
didn™t know where to ask, no idea.  And George
 was born in 1946 and my mi nd was– I am not 
saying that I was happy, but you know, I was happy th
at I have a family.  I always wanted a 
fa mily and I never knew that I can have a family. 
 I never knew that I can have a child anymore, 
so I was very happy that I had a child.  And I neve
r knew.  Never, and I didn™t come  with no one.  
Because a lot of people I met from
 my, from the place where they were ho me  when they took my  
parents.  I have in Brooklyn tw
o friends, only two, who knew my pa
rents, in this whole world,  
only two.  Those people knew my pa rents and my 
sister.  And they knew what was happening to 
the non-citizens.  Because we were not citizens 
that time .  We  were Czech citizens, but the 
Hungarians took it over, so we were now citizens.
  And those people were Hungarians.  I don™t 
know, yes, they were Hungarians.  Hungarians. 
 They weren™t Russians.  They took only the 
Russians, no other citizens.  And so they knew 
that they took them some
where, but they didn™t 
know why, because I was questioning them in Br
ooklyn.  I said, ﬁDid you know what happened 
to them? ﬂ   They said they never knew what happe
ned to them, they just knew that the transpor t 
went and never came back.   
 

Q: And I wanted to go back again and ask you a lit
tle bit more about the time right after the war had 
ended and you returned to Hungary.  You talked 
about how you wanted to have a family.  What 
else, what we re your hopes at that point?   We re  you thinking about the future?   Did you want to 

stay in Hungary?   Did you and your husband talk–? 
 

A: We couldn™t go, we couldn™t go, we
 couldn™t go nowhere.  We had to 
stay in Hungary.  It was no 
way under the Russians, that we could get– I got in
 touch with my uncle, here in America.  And 
he wanted us very badly, but it was no way that
 we– ma ybe old people got 
visas already at that 
time to Israel, but young people didn™t.  And we 
were young people, so it was impossible.  And 
then in ‚49, I had the ot her boy, so I didn™t even th
ink about it that we should go anyplace, to try.  
And we didn™t have a ba d life 
until it was really co
mmunism.  Because I had a ma id, sleep-in 
ma id.  I didn™t have to work.  And in 1948 when 
it was really communis m, I had to let her go, the 
girl, and I had to go to work.  Because everybody 
had to show what they are living from, because 

my husband was in private business and he coul
dn™t show how much he is ma king.  And he 
ma de nice money.  But I had to go to work. 
 

Q: Did your husband lose his business at that time? 

 

A: No, well he lost it after, yes. After he lost it.  And he couldn™t 
get a job, because they said he is a 
Capitalist.  It was very hard for him to get a j
ob on his profession, but then
 later on he got a job.  
He got a job later on, but it was not
 a state job.  It was again priv
ate.  He we nt together with 
some body a nd they had– he was actually, he fini
shed business college, but actually what was 
his business before the wa r, he was [laughing], 
I have to always laugh that we eat the oats, 
because that they gave to horses in Hungary.  A
nd he was in that business, feeding, oat feeding, 
because everything was horses, not cars.  Th
e transportation was horses and it was a bi g 
business, the animal food for the horses.  And they  connected with the, with the– gosh, with the 

market.   
 

Q: Stock? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

A: Stock Market.  So he had a big business and he
 ma de a lot of money, but whenever he ma de the 
money, we bought a Persian rug or we bought silver.  I 
have 40 kilo silver stuff.  I had a beautiful 
case and it was everything silver in it, because  we
 couldn™t show the mo ney.  We couldn™t put it 
in the bank or some thing.  And then they didn™t 
bother us.  They bother us in one way: that we 
had a big apartment.  Because when my aunt™s apartment was ready, they renovated it, we 
moved in, in the old apartment a
nd it was a very big one.  I mean large rooms, there were three 
large rooms.  And actually the fourth one was a ro om, too, the foyer, because we had furniture in 

there.  And we had a kitchen and bathroom and 
we had a room for the ma id from the kitchen.  
And the third room was a very big, it was so big th
at George when he was little, he could bicycle 
in it.  That was his room.  And they took away 
from us that room.  Y
ou know?   And they ma de 
an apartment from it, a one-bedroom apartment.  And they put in a family, only with one son.  A 

fa mily with one son.  It was so big that th
ey ma de kitchen, bedroom, ba throom– I don™t know, I 
never went in, what is it.  They
 were our neighbors.  But otherw
ise, we didn™t have trouble.  
They took away the business of my uncle.  He 
had 40 pairs of horses and two big trucks.  They 
were the first ones, because they were in– i
n– how do you call it, that business, when people 
moved.  It™s a moving, not moving, actually it™s no
t moving.  But with the horses, too, they were 
renting it or whatever, to companies.  And ver
y, very big business.  40 pairs.  And when it 

happened, they took my husband and he worked for th
em.  He  loved horses, that was his life, the 
horses, horseback riding actually.  He  loved it.  
And so he worked for them.  But then they took 
away the business from them, from my uncle, so 
he had to– they didn™t work anymore because 
they were elderly people.  And when the oppor
tunity came after the H
ungarian Revolution, my 
uncle™s brother escaped to Vienna with his wife
.  And fa mily is supposed to go after them, but 
we didn™t succeed. 
 

Q: You did tell that story.  
So your husband, what was the name  of your uncle, who your husband 
worked for? 
 

A: That was my uncle Eugene. 

 

Q: Okay, Ilona™s husband. 

 

A: Ilona™s husband and his brother,
 they were together.  And th
at was the business what they 
inherited from their parents. 
 It was a very old business. 
 

Q: And is that the same  uncle, your uncle™s brother,
 who got out after the Re
volution?  Is that the 
same  one?  
 

A: Okay, no.  He started to work with them too.  He was in an entirely–

Tape 4, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number four, side A 
of an interview with Emilie Szekely. 
 
A: My uncle, my mother™s brother was in labor
 camp in Hungary and when the Germans were 
leaving, they ma naged to take him to Germany 
and he was in Buchenwald.  And one day I was 
prescribing, I got always the Smithsonian ma gazi
ne and it was a picture 
there, a nice article 
about the Holocaust.  And the picture showed Buch
enwald and a part of the bunk beds, a part of 
the, it was the– 
 

Q: Barracks? 

 

A: Ya, and on the end of one of the beds, on the end 
was, the picture, they 
were all looking in the 
camera because it was after the war, and it was mark
ed, Elie Wi esel.  And on the othe r side ther e 
were three men, betwee n them, it was my uncle.  I r
ecognized him.  It was my mother™s brother. 
 

Q: And his name was–? 

 

A: Joseph.  And when Elie Wi esel was here about, 
that™s now four, five– Ilona was a senior, that™s 
four years ago.  Four years ago, he was here 
in Lexington and he had 
a wonderful, wonderful 
speech.  It was the Jewish Federation and the UK, 
they did it together.  And it was in UK, in the 
Memorial Hall.  Before that, they had a dinnerin the club, but it was 150dollars a plate, and I 

didn™t have 150 dollars for a dinner.  And peopl
e were comi ng out and they were telling him 
what a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands
 with him.  And I was very upset that I know 
that ma n from my co-worker, who was a very
 good friend, her father was very good friend, her 
husband, of Elie Wi esel and I couldn™t see him.
  I couldn™t talk to him.  So when it was 
everything over, Ana was telling me , ﬁ Wait, wa
it, ma ybe you can see it, go to his dressing 

room.ﬂ  So, a gentlema n was sta
nding there from UK, they didn™t let nobody to see him.  And I 
went there.  It was the rabbi™s 
wife, that time , Ra bbi Slaten™s 
(ph ) 
wife, and she was talking for 
me .  And she says, ﬁWould you let that lady in only
 for a few mi nutes?   She is the only survivor 
here in Lexington and she would like to talk to h
im, only for a few mi nutes.ﬂ  So he says, ﬁYes, I 
will do it, but she has to wait 
until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody™s going, 
they want to go, too.ﬂ  So, I was waiting, I says, ﬁI
 gladly wait.ﬂ  So, I was waiting and he helped 

me  down the steps, because they were wooden st
eps in the baseme nt.  It was the– I couldn™t 
believe it.  He says, ﬁYes, we are hiding peopl
e.ﬂ  [Laughing.]  And it 
was nothing to hold onto 
and they were wooden steps and he was helpi
ng me  to go down.  And suddenly I came and the 
door is open and he™s standing th
ere.  He was a very, very at
tractive ma n.  And my hea r t was 
beating, that I couldn™t say nothing, so I says, ﬁHell
o.ﬂ  He wa s very friendly.  I says, ﬁHello.ﬂ  
He says, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ  I didn™t say even my na me
, I was so excited.  I says, ﬁI am a Holocaust 

survivor and I am the only one here.ﬂ  He sa
ys, ﬁIf you are a Holocaust survivor, you must be 
from Europe.ﬂ  I says, ﬁYes.ﬂ  He says, ﬁWhere
 are you from? ﬂ   I says, 
ﬁBudapest.ﬂ  He says, 
ﬁBudapest? ﬂ  And he starts to ta
lk to me , Hungarian.  I couldn™t 
believe it.  I said, ﬁYou speak 
still Hungarian?ﬂ  Because he didn™t, I mean, 
I don™t know where he learned, because where he 
was, they were very religious people, his pare
nts.  And I think they
 spoke Yiddish and not 
Hungarian, but he spoke Hungarian.  And he 
was 15 years old, ma ybe in school, correct, in 
school, probably he learned.  He spoke wonderful
.  And he says, ﬁNo, I 
can, because I have no

one to talk to.ﬂ  His wife is French.  I sa
ys, ﬁDon™t tell me , you speak Hungarian.ﬂ  And from 
then on he spoke Hungarian to me .  And he as
ked me  where I know him from.  And I  me ntioned 
his friend™s name .  And he says, ﬁKorma n! (
ph)
ﬂ  He says, ﬁI saw him last week!ﬂ  That™s what 
he™s telling me .  I says, ﬁYes, because of you he di
dn™t want  to retire to Florida, because he was 
often–ﬂ he lives in New York, act
ually, and teaches in Boston.  A
nd they had from that part of 
the town, Sighet 
(ph )
, they had an organization.  And that 
my  friend™s husband went always there 
because he loved him.  And she then was telling 
me what went on in that organization and what 
happened at that organization [la
ughing] when they were together
, so I knew a lot about him.  
And I was telling it to him.  He 
says, ﬁBecause of you, he didn™t wa
nt to move to Florida.ﬂ  He 
says, ﬁYou know what?   I saw him in Florida.ﬂ  Wh
en he was down in Florida, he saw hi m.  So 
he was very nice, and then he says, what I am 
doing, and I told him that I am talking in schools, 
and he says, ﬁ Wonderful.ﬂ  He says, ﬁWhat grade 
are you starting? ﬂ   I says, ﬁSixth.ﬂ  He  says, 
ﬁThat™s the right grade to st
art, don™t do younger ones.ﬂ  But I 
did, because they were begging 
me .  Lexington School for five graders.  Ana went
 to SCAPA, they were four graders.  They 
were begging me , especially in SCAPA, they we
re very smart kids.  A
nd here too, in Lexington 
School, they are very, very– I s
poke twice already there.  And 
now I, the teacher was always 
asking me  whether I know a book for 
children.  I am reading now in a ma gazine that he, Elie 
Wi esel, wrote his first children™s 
book about the Holocaust with pict
ures.  So, I try to get that 
book and I try to call that teache
r in Lexington School, because she is very intelligent.  She is 
teaching fifth graders.  And they understood it.  
What kind of letters I got from the m, from the 
fifth– I just cannot believe it, how they understo
od it and how sorry they are for me .  And they 
cannot believe it, that I lived th
rough that.  Fifth graders.  So
 I tell you the truth, that I spoke 
about 150, 160 times since I am here.  That if
 I cannot do it, because I will be the mo st 
unhappiest person in the world, because 
I feel the commit me nt that I ha
ve to do it.  I still have to 
do it, because there are ma ny, many people, who 
don™t know it still and thos
e are adults, mostly 
adults.  The children are starting 
to know me  in schools, because 
I go back always, because they 
are different classes, and most of them they know. 
 In the colleges, too.  I was all over in every 
college, Berea, Midway, and the private colle
ge, Transylvania, twice, UK three times.  
Community college.  So, they know all ready.  But 
the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they 
don™t know.  So, I will be  really– and even if th
ey call me to schools, next graders who didn™t 
hear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I 
always think about it.  That it give me – I 
cannot explain it, when I talk, I 
am ve ry enthusiastic and I live 
it through again.  That™s true.  
And I have to take a tranquilizer
, I must take before I go.  And I never spoke about my  parents, 
because I couldn™t.  I was always cryi ng.  And la
tely I am even showing the pictur es of my 
parents.  And if they give me  enough time to te
ll them that story on the end, I am including it, 
what happened to them and I am showing their pict
ures.  And I was so relieved that I did it.  
Okay, I didn™t sleep at night, but I was relieved
 that I did something 
good for them who died.  
You know?   I took it in my head that they died a
nd they won™t be at peace 
until the last survivor 
is going to tell their story.  It™s– I cannot expl
ain it, what happened to me, because I never 
spoke.  I never spoke. 
 

Q: So, in those years imme diately after the wa
r that you were in Hunga
ry, you didn™t speak about 
your experiences at all?   
 

A:  I didn™t speak, even in New York, never.  Ne
w York, I didn™t have to, because there w
e re so 
ma ny, I never heard deni al.  And here I started on
ly because I heard de nial.  In Hungary I neve r

spoke about it because the Hungarians are very 
anti-Semitic.  And they told you that ﬁToo ma ny 
of you ca me  back.ﬂ  It™s a Catholic country.  I 
am not saying that the intelligent people, but I 
heard it from people saying it.  S
o, in Hungary, I even went to a doc
tor, I wanted to take off my 
number because it was so uncomfo
rtable when I was holding onto the 
train.  I went to the city.  I 
worked for the book publishers, you know, the dictiona
ries.  And that™s where they were telling, 
they were looking at those numbers like, ﬁI w
ould kill you,ﬂ you know?   Maybe it was in me  that 
I thought it, but no.  Even today, even I told you,
 I was in 1978, in Hungary with Ilona– 1978?   

What am I t a lking about?   She was born in 1970.  
1989 I was with her.  I told you that story, no?   
And we lived there for months? 
 

Q: Youme ntionedit. 

 

A: We lived, my sister -i n-law was still alive at  
that  time, my husband™s sister and she took an 
apartment for us, because  they had only a one bedroom apartment.  A ver y beautiful pl ace.  And 

he took us for an apartment, a rental, close to
 them.  And it was a woma n, whose husband was a 
school principal, but they were divorced.  And 
she had a son, an engineer and he didn™t live 
home and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and 
a living room.  One be dr
oom was separate and 
then she had a room in Bolotow 
(ph )
, near Lake Bolotow 
(ph )
, that she went there.  If she rented 
the apartment she went there, th
at she shouldn™t be home.  But we were always begging her, that 
it doesn™t bother us, she should stay home.  B
ecause she was the only person who spoke English 
and Ilona could spoke to her Engl
ish.  She was the only person.  And she worked for the– she 
was babysitting in the Canadian Embassy for so
me body.  So, she spoke English well.  We  were 
glad when she stayed home  and when she st
ayed home  she went down and she brought us 
always fresh bread and milk, and she was very
 nice to us.  We didn™t speak about religion, 
absolutely.  And the last day, the 
last day before we left, she cam
e to me and she said, ﬁI didn™t 
sleep the whole night.ﬂ  I says, ﬁWhy? ﬂ   She sa
ys, ﬁBecause I just find out, I just notice your 
number that you are Jewish and I am Jewi
sh, too.  Nobody knows it in the house.ﬂ  In 1989, 
nobody knows it in the house.  ﬁThey 
are suspicious,ﬂ she said.  
But her husband, I don™t know.  
I don™t reme mber already her name .  But it was 
a Hungarian name .  But he changed his name  
because it wa s a  Jewish name . He changed it wh
en he was a school principal.  And once, she 
was telling that she was here in America in 
Los Angeles for a month and she™s mentioning a 
name , who invited her.  And I knew them, those pe
ople, that they were Jewish people.  In New 
Pest, you know?   But still I just di
dn™t realize it that she™s Jewi
sh.  And she wouldn™t ask me  and 
I wouldn™t ask her.  But one day, she wasn™t home 
and I see– I took the ma il, and a letter came  

from Israel.  And when I gave it to her, she ri
ght away put it in her pocket.  Because she knew 
that my sister-in-law was convert
ed and ma rried to a non-Jew and 
she got that apartment and she 
thought we are not Jewish.  She was afraid to
 say that she is Jewish.  So then– it was 
unbelieva ble.  And when we came home , I sent 
her some  nylon panty hose because she couldn™t 

get it.  And for two or three years I was writi
ng her.  And I didn™t realize it, she said, ﬁI 
me ntioned to you so ma ny times who took me , 
who took me, who invited me –ﬂ and her son 
was there too.  I don™t know
 how long he was in Los Angeles, in
 California.  And I didn™t realize 
it, he went out once with that ma n, but he wa
s married.  And both of them, he and the wife, 
invited her, but I didn™t– you know?   [Laughing.]
  I didn™t know hi m personally.  But I knew, 
and I knew his name , those people who were in Los Angeles.   
 

Q: Didyou– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
45
 
 
 
A: So that™s the situation, and even today, they ar
e hiding people, they are Jews.  They are– it™s no 
good, it™s still no good in Hungary.  Under the co
mmunis m, it was no Jew, we couldn™t say, no 
religion.  They were forcing us to
 work.  A Jewish boss, he was forcing us to work on the Jewish 
holidays and he was a lawyer.  And one day, I thought it?  I said it?   --One day– his secretary 

was a very nice person.  She was Jewish, too.  Bu
t ma ny people worked there, they were all 
intellectuals, because they were– whatever we ha
d intellectually, if it™s 
so me thing medical, the 
doctors that were there and engine
ers or whatever.  It™s very in
teresting.  And he, on the biggest 
holiday, Yom Kippur, he called us to his office, me
 and his secretary and he ma de us eat.  He 

was in the Pa rty, the Communist Party because of 
his job.  But who saw it?   Why did he have to 
do it?   I couldn™t go to the syna
gogue, so I went home  by bus, I re
me mber.  Because it was, we 
lived in New Pest and that was in mi d-town.  We
 were passing the street where the synagogue is, 
I jumped off the bus at that 
station and after work
 I went to the synagogue.  And in the 
concentration camp I didn™t know that
 it™s holiday or not holiday, 
but the Polish people knew it.  
And they were telling us when it™s Yo m Kippur.  
They knew it from outside the world.  Because 
people who went to work outside, they some how got
 in touch with Polish people.  And then they 
said that tomorrow is like Yom Kippur, so I didn™t
 eat.  I was used not to eat, because eat, the 
food was only bread when we got off from th
e work, you know?   I was 
fasting there and I go 
back and I have to eat.   
 

Q: Did you have a sense of
 faith at the time?    
 
A: At the camp?  I lost  my faith. 

 

Q: After– 

 
A: In camp, I was always saying, ﬁWhere is God?  
 Where is God,ﬂ when I found out what is going 
on in camp, that they killed all the little kids.  And I 
says, ﬁWhere is God that he let, that he let it 
do those people?   Where is God?   Is it a God? ﬂ 
 I absolutely didn™t belie
ve it.  I just– I was 
saying that too, always, that I wa
s, at night when we
 couldn™t go out after work, when we were 
already inside, but if we had the chairs just to
 look outside and look at
 the stars.  And I was 
unbelievable home sick, unbelievabl
e.  And I was just always saying, I says, ﬁMy God,ﬂ Œ‚my 
God™ I didn™t say.  I just sai
d, ﬁDoes Frank,ﬂ Frank was my hu
sband, ﬁsee the same  stars what 
I™m seeing?ﬂ  Terrible home sick, and never, neverthought that I can survive from there.  Never.  
It was so impossible, you know?   It was impossi
ble.  First of all, 
I didn™t know where is 
Auschwitz.  I didn™t know that we 
are close to Krakow, we are in 
Poland.  I knew that we were in 
Poland, but I had no idea where we were.  And 
I never thought that it can happen, that the 
Russians are going to liberate 
it and we have to go.   
 

Q: So after the war when you went to synagogue, did you just  go because of tradition? 

 

A: Oh, no.  Aft e r the war, no, af
ter the war, we lived under communis m and we went to synagogue 
secretly.  And it was a, a nurser
y, a preschool in the synagogue, a
nd George went there.  But it 
was everything secretly.  When he went to schoo
l he had no religion.  He 
wasn™t allowed to say 
that he has religion.  No religion.  When we went
 to Vienna, for 17 months we lived there.  He 
was the only Jewish kid there.  And they were
 suspicious because they we re praying every 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
46
 
 
morning.  And once the teacher called me , ﬁ Why doe
s he doesn™t pray?ﬂ  I said, ﬁBecause he has 
no religion.  We lived under communism, that™s 
why he doesn™t pray.ﬂ  And every day I was 
dying until he came home from school.  I was so 
afraid what™s going to happen, that they find 
out that he™s Jewish.  It was te
rrible, terrible.  Hitler came from 
Vienna.  I told you that.  That 
even in 1957, when we went to Vienna, the workers, when they worked, they started with a 
bottle of beer and ﬁHeil Hitler.ﬂ 
 

Q: So, when you went, but did you go, you didn™t go 
to synagogue because you had religious faith? 
 

A: No.  When I  went back and I found Illie, Il
ona, when I find her and I find her husband, her 
husband, they weren™t, they weren™t religious.  Th
ey were religious and no
t religious.  We didn™t 
have nothing to eat.  So my si
ster-in-law ma nage d to buy every 
year a– she was close to the 
countryside and everybody knew them there wher
e they lived.  Her husband had a very big 
position wi th the state.  And he, himself, was an
 anti-Semite, my sister-in-law™s husband.  It™s 
unbelievable.  I was telling you about it.  Ok
ay.  But they ma naged, some how, I don™t know 
how– we got every year a pig.  Pig!  So, and 
it was a butcher, who came 
to the house, and they 
ma de for us and for Ilona, for them– my uncle 
wasn™t alive at that time , Joseph.  Because he 
was very religious, you wouldn™t beli
eve it that he went with a little prayer book to Buchenwald 
and he ma na ged to bring it back wi
th him.  Because that time already, they weren™t ki lling there, 
in Buchenwald, when he got there.  And he brought
 it back.  He was very religious.  That™s why 
he stayed with us, and not with Illie, Ilona, b
ecause  of the pork.  But we ate the pork, too.  We  
had it, too.  Especially when he
 died, it was– we ate it becaus
e there wa s nothing else, and we 
had food for  the whole year.  George doesn™t kno
w it.  He doesn™t reme mber it, so I am not 
telling it to him.  And I am not telling it even to
 the grandchi ldren.  Ana is crazy when she would 
hear it.  She™s watching always 
what you are ordering.  She is– y
eah.  But he was the president 
of the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping 
ma ny, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel.  
That time it was secret.  Secretly, they went 
through Czechoslovakia.  So, that way he was 
religious, but, you know?   But we co
uldn™t show it that we were re
ligious or not 
religious.  But 
we ate pork.  But I got back my religion.  I got my
 belief.  I got it back slowly, slowly I got it 
back.  I was always thinking about my mother, 
how he taught us, she ta
ught us to pray in 
Czechoslovakia.  And when we went to the sy
nagogue like Fr iday night or some thing, I was 
always thinking about it, how we 
were crying, but every week we had to read one more page.  
And it was so hard for us, myself and my sister
.  And I was thinking about them.  And as I was 
thinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion.  And especially when I came to 
America.  When I came to America and my uncl
e was– he wasn™t, he ate everything.  I™m not 
saying that they didn™t cook pork, but he was re
ligious.  And I reme mber him and my father 
when they were together and Passover, when they
 were together.  And every Saturday they went 
to the synagogue and then they came to us and 
they were singing after l
unch those songs that you 
are supposed to.  And when I thought about those 
things it came  back to me , you know?   It™s 
very interesting.  And now I love to go to the 
synagogue, and I am so heartbroken.  I wa sn™t there 
now three weeks, I think.  I am mi ssing it.  A
nd I™m mi ssing it.  We  don™t have a rabbi now.  He 
left.  I loved him.  It™s interesting that he™s
 near Ci ncinnati and Ilona
 was teaching here Sunday 
school art for four years.  And now he™s te
aching in his new– she goes down to the new 
congregation and she™s teaching, but only twice a 
month because it™s 40 miles away.  So, and 
it™s, but– she sees him.  And I cannot see th
em.  I was very good friends with– she™s a very 
young woman.  His wife is from Ci
ncinnati.  He™s from Minnesota, the rabbi.  And his parents 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
47
 
 
were Czechoslovakians, Czechs.  His father, I me
t his father many ti mes, he™s an optometrist .  
When he came visit he still speak Czech.   
 
Q: What was his name ?   The Rabbi. 

 

A: The Rabbi?  Slaten 
(ph)
. 
 

Q: And he was at the Orthodox, no it™s – 

 

A: Conservative.   

 

Q: Conservative. 

 

A: Conservative.  Slaten. 
 He has three sons and he was here 
11 years.  My grandson was the first 
Bar Mitzvah with him.   
 

Q: About the question where was God, did you just
 stop asking it or did 
you come  up with some  
kind of answer? 
 

A: No, I didn™t get no answer because I knew what
 was happening.  I didn™t get no answer.  But I 
was just always questioning, ﬁWhere is God?   Is
 there a God,ﬂ that™s what I was saying.  ﬁIs 
there a God, does he see what™s happen
ing?   Why, why is it happening? ﬂ 
 

Q: Do you ask yourself those questions anymore? 

 

A: Yes I am.  Why did it happen, actually?   Why did 
it happen?  For those innocent little kids, what 
could they do?   What kind of sins they had?  
 Babies.  What kind of sins they had that it 
happened?   And then I am going back to Spanish 
Inquisition.  [Laughing.]  So what was there?   
They killed the Jews all over.  Always.  The 
Jews are always the [laughing]– for everywhere 
and everything they are blaming the Jews.  So, it
™s no answer.  It™s no an
swer.  First the Blacks 
came and aft er that the Jews.  Some places they– 
when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks, 
then there are the Jews the first who are blam
ed for everything.  Why?   Does anybody knows 
why?   I lived under democracy in Czechoslovaki
a.  It was a real, real democracy.  Nobody 
knows what™s democracy.  Only if some body lived under that time Masaryk and Benes.  They 

always said, ﬁ We cannot be anti-Semitic, neve
r.  Because we have the br ain, and we are 
businessmen and we are everything what the Jews 
are.ﬂ  So I was thinking about it, that it™s 

jealousy.  It was jealousy from Hitler that the
y, he  took it from– they were supporting him, the 
Jews in Germany.  They ma de him big.  And th
en when he knew what they are doing and why, 
then they ki lled them and he wanted to have 
it.  Why are they anti, I don™t know, anti-Semitic 
here, I don™t know.  I never heard it from no one , but
 I can imagine that th
e Southern Baptist are 
anti-Semitic.  I am thinking it only because I 
was invited [laughing] to every church, every 
denomination, but never to a Baptist church.  So 
it must be some thing against the Jews.  They 
won™t say it to your face, but it must be.  They 
know it.  They saw me  in the paper.  They know 

it.  And I was never, never, and I was on every 
Christian church.  What is that?   How do you call 

it?   What is it?   And I™m telling it to the ch
ildren.  I™m finishing my speech, and I™m saying it to 
them that why I am doing it, I™m doing it that yo
u should learn not to hate and you should teach 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
48
 
 
your parent s not to hate, because I don™t think so 
that a little kid knows wh
at is to hate.  It™s 
comi ng from some whe r e, from the adults.  Correct?    
 
Q: Can you reme mber and describe the events of the 1956 Uprising? 

 

A: Yes.  In 1956– 

 

Q: From your perspective. 

 

A: –Nixon was in Hungary at that time.  And the 
students from university, th
ey got in touch with 
him.  And what was discussed, what wasn™t 
discussed, I don™t know between them, but when 

Nixon left, next day, it was the Uprising.  The st
udents, the college stude
nts, they took over the 
radio station.  That was the first.  We  didn™t ha
ve televisions.  That 
was the first.  And the 
Russians actually never left Hungary and they 
were all over scattered 
in the woods and around.  
But we didn™t see them in the cities, but they
 were there.  And it was communis m.  And Nixon 
was telling them, ﬁ Do it.ﬂ  How do we know that?  Because the last Prime mi nister, Nagy, Imre 

Nagy, who was killed by the Russians.  He was 
on the radio and he was 
begging, he was begging 
America and he was begging Nixon, he was telling 
him, ﬁOkay, do it.ﬂ  He thought that we get 
some  help.  So they came in with their tanks a
nd with their soldiers.  It was a war.  They 
bombed–

Tape 4, Side B 
 
 
A: –the apartment that we lived in Budapest, yes. 
 We  lived there.  And so when they came in in 
19– no that was 1956, the uprising.  Up to that poin
t it was all right.  We  worked and we were 
communist, but we worked.  I mean, the wealthy 
people were very afraid and we were very 
afraid with my uncle, that they are going to ta
ke them.  Beca use they came  at night.  They 
knocked on the doors, and taked people on they, 
on their cars, on their– the Russians, with 
machine guns.  And they took them to villages, and th
ey took them to villages and they left them.  
There were certain villages where they were 
designated where they took the wealthy people.  
And they couldn™t come  back to Budapest. 
 But thank God, thank God it never happened.  
Because that was against– again, it was some body 
had to tell them who are the wealthy people.  
And they were in very good friendship with ever
ybody from the higher-ups there.  Because that 

was a borough, New Pest, where we lived.  And 
like New York has five boroughs, the same  
thing Budapest has.  And so they knew everybo
dy, and they were friends with everybody, and so 
nobody told on them, so they weren™t taken away
.  Their business was taken away, but they 
didn™t.  They weren™t taken away.  What was done
 to them, they had to 
move together, the two 
families, in one apartment, because  it was too big 
for two people.  Gorgeous apartment.  House.  

And they took away they apartment and they had 
to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother-
in-law, two brothers.  And they had to rent the upst
airs apartment.  They d
ecided that they™d take 
the first floor and the second floor, it was a docto
r, a gynecologist with his fa mily.  But they 
didn™t take them out.  And from
 that, that they take out ma
ny wealthy people, ma ny wealthy 
people ma rried non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, bu
t it wasn™t a ma tch.  Just only because those 
people were giving them stay, somewhere to st ay.  
Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a 
second cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mo
ther were sisters, cousins.  I™m sorry, first 
cousins.  And she is the only one who surviv
ed from that fami ly, nobody.  She had two uncles 
and the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmot
her and her grandmother were sisters and that™s 
how the mot hers were first cousins, my mother 
and her mother.  And she was an only child and 
the only survivor.  She survived.  Her parents put 
her in a factory.  I didn™t tell you all that?   I 
don™t know.  To a factory where they were ma ki
ng like General Electric.  They were ma king 
light bulbs.  It was Tungsraum 
(ph )
, it was a very well known company.  I  think, in fact, now 
after the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric.  Some thing, I don™t know.  But 

young girls, they worked there.  And when they 
took her parents, she was working there and they 
slept there and everythi ng.  So they worked for 
the army and when they finished with the work, 
when the work was finished, they let them go.  But they di dn™t have where to go, because they 

were, nobody was there already, we were all gone.  
And that™s– I think I, some where I said that 
story, that she was hiding.  One of her aunts ha
d a ma id and she recomme nded where to go, to a 
woma n, who was non-Jewish and he
r husband was Jewish and he wa
s in labor camp.  And she 
had a house.  And she took in about eight people
, Jewish people.  It was a doctor, it wa s my 
cousins and her boyfriend and I don™t know, about ei
ght people.  And she was hiding them.  I 
told that story?    
 

A:  You did me ntion that story.  

 

Q:  Okay.  So why did we say that? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

Q: So, going back to the 1956 uprising– re
me mbe r ing the events of the uprising. 
 
A: –1956, okay.  They came  in with their tanks and th
ey were horrible.  They
 were raping girls, the 
soldiers, the Russian soldiers. 
 

Q: Did you see that happening? 

 

A: No, no, but we were very worried, because we ha d 
a maid at that time.  We were very close to 
her.  And it was terrible.  I reme mber that  it was 
George™s birthday and he wanted a car.  Before 
that he knew what he wants in the toy store a
nd we went, we went ther
e and stood on line to get 
him the car.  And the tanks were turned towards us
.  The end was so close to us.  Every mi nute, 
or when we are standing for bread, the tanks were 
turned always to shoot us.  It was terrible.  
Then, one day, I don™t know what happened– not one day, they did it many times.  But they 

were very close to us and they were shooting 
during the night.  And we were in the apartment 
and baseme nts were on the other side of the build
ing, the baseme nts, and we had to run to the 
other side with the children.  I had at that
 time my  cousin™s, who was in Russia, his two 
daughters.  They were with us because they 
went some whe r e for vacation and it happened under 
the vacation.  And they lived far,
 very far from us.  They lived 
in Buda, what was very far from 
us and they couldn™t pick up the children.  And they 
stayed with us, two little
 girls.  We had to go 
to the basement because they were shelling in 
the backyard.  Terribl e.  I don™t know how many 

nights we spent in the baseme nt.  Wh en it stopped,
 when they already were in control, I don™t 
know how long it took them.  It took them a long time, and they were in control.  Then Austria 

opened the borders, their borders and people who 
lived close, they could just walk over to 
Austria.  And thousands and thousands, and most ly
 the peasants, because they were all farmlands 
around the border, you know?   They went all over 
to Austria and in Austria they put up camps 
for them and America was sending money for it.  
We were far away, we couldn™t go, because we 
were 400 mi les away from the border, in Budapest
.  So we couldn™t go.  That story is in.  How 
did I get out, and the Russians.  That™s in. 
 

Q: I wanted to ask you– we™ll go on to Vienna a
nd then talk about your journey to the United 
States.  But I wanted to ask you whether you 
wanted to say anything about your husband and 
your relationship with hi m, because last time 
we talked you said he was a stranger to you and 

then all of sudden you me t hi m afte r the war. 
 

A: He was a stranger to me  in that way, that I kne
w him for three weeks, when he wanted to ma rry 
me.  And then he couldn™t marry me because I 
was underage .  And then they took him in labor 
camp.  He was away, and I don™t know, a few tim
es he wrot e me  cards.  But I didn™t know 
what™s going to happen, whether he stays with me  whether he will wait for me .  And he was four 

years in labor camps, so I didn™t know what™s going
 to happen.  But I re
ally– that™s why I say 
that I really didn™t know him.  I told you a
bout the other boy, whom I went with somebody for 
four years.  So, I was very mi xed up.  I was ve ry mi xed up.  I don™t know whether I fell in love 

with my hus band right away.  But my heart wa
s broken when the other one find out and then 
wrote me  a letter, ﬁWhy did I do it? ﬂ  If he woul
d know that I need a name , he would ma rry me  
right away.  And– but it was late
 already, everything was arranged th
at he fell in love with me , 
my husband.  So– he was seven years older, an
d I knew he was very good looking.  And I knew 
who was the fa mily, first of all, because my a
unt and his aunt were ve ry good friends.  So, I

knew the family from my own– and I didn™t know
 what™s going to be, and when I met him, you 
know, when we came ba ck, I was te
rribly crying and he was crying, 
too.  But he knew I™m alive.  
He knew, because he knew months ago already when
 they got the notice.  But he was waiting for 
me .  But I wasn™t sure whether he has some body 
in between or not, though we got ma rried.  We  
were ma rried in 1944, in February, when we got 
ma rried.  For two weeks we were together and 
that was that.  And I was always
, you know, afraid that they are 
going to take me still.  I am 
ma rried, but we went to a hotel, I reme mber on 
the ma rriage night.  It was unbelievable.  We  
went down to eat.  It was in the city, a beautifu
l hotel.  And everybody constantly was afraid that 
they are comi ng and asking for identif
ication and that kind of a thing. 
 It was horrible.  So I said, 
ﬁLet™s check out.  I don™t want to 
stay here.ﬂ  We  went back.  We
 went back, and we stayed with 
my grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, 
too, with Ilona.  Ilika is a, in Hungarian, I don™t 
know what it is in any language.  If some body has a na
me , they ma ke it like softer.  Ilika is softer 
than Ilona.  You know?   But that™s from Ilona, so
 we called her Ilika.  And I was Milika, my 
name  was Millie, I mean my nickname is Mi
llie.  Nobody knew me  as Emilie, only in school, 
and at work.  But otherwise, the whole fa mily 
and my friends– and then we came to America, I 
didn™t know that it™s an American name, too.  A
nd I never mentioned it.  It was always Emilie 
and that was it.  But my friends are still ca
lling me  Millie on the 
phone and my cousin and 
everybody is calling me .  I have a cousin in Canada
.  My cousin who was eight years in Siberia, 
seven years, from ‚41 to ‚48.  He has a son.  And he
 escaped after ‚56, they sent him, the parents.  
He went to University at that time already, two y
ears as an engineer.  And he was, when he came  
back he was a communist.  He wasn™t a communist, 
he was in the party and because of that, that 
he was in Russia and spoke alrea
dy Russian, he got a very big job 
in the Ministry.  He  was– as 
an engineer.  He knew that he never can come  
to America, because he was in the Communist 
Party.  So when it was finished, the communis m
, when the– I mean, whe n they opened the 
borders, he se nt his son alone to 
Vienna.  But he ha d to go to Israel, because  the plan was that the 
parents are going to come after him to Israel.  
They knew that he cannot come  to Ame r ica.  We  
weren™t here.  And so he went alone to Israel
, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his 
mother, and he stayed with the friends.  And he 
went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer, 
too.  And the parents went after him,  they got pa
ssport.  Parents and two sisters, who we re born 
after he came home, the two sisters.  But he 
escaped with his mothe
r™s motherŠgrandmother, 
grandfather and heŠthey escaped
 the mi ddle of Budapest.  
I don™t know whether you heard 
about Wallenberg, that Swedish man?   He was hi
ding them.  He was from that group and his 
mother, and his grandmother and grandfather.  Gra
ndmother.  Grandfather di
ed before they went 
to Israel.  The grandmother went with them to Isra
el and she died in Israel.  My cousin went with 
them.  I me a n of course he went with them.  He di
ed in Israel.  And it is 
very interesting that his 
father was in the First World Wa r and he got– he 
was in Siberia, too, hi
s father.  And he got a 
nerve disease, nerves.  It was terr
ible.  I reme mbe r  him very well. 
 T h a t w a s  my  mo t h e r ™ s  si s t e r ™s 
husband.  And he got the same  disease in Isra
el.  He was a young ma n.  He was 60, 62 when he 
died.  And he got a job as an e
ngineer, but in a differe
nt field.  It was a margarine factor y where 
he was in engineering, like ma king colognes and 
that kind of, you know?   Entirely different.  But 
they were okay.  Her father gave a lot of money to
 Israel, so they were okay in Israel.  The two 
sisters, my cousin™s two sisters 
were in Israel, the two sister s. 
 And the mo ther, she was here.  
When she was 75 years old, she came to Canada a
nd she came to me here and it was winter and 
she says, ﬁGod, I love to see the snow.  I never sn
ow since I am in Israel.ﬂ  It was a big snow 
when she was here.  And she spent her 75
th
 birthday here.  And two year
s later she died.  She had

diabetes and she didn™t take care of herself.  Sh e ate everything in the world, but she lived well.  
I spoke to her daughter and she said, ﬁThat™s th
e only thing, we are happy that she lived well.ﬂ 
 

Q: Let™s go back, because we got off t he subject, 
you were talking about your relationshi p with your 
husband.   
 

A: So again.  So, I wasn™t, when I came  back.  So I said, this was a long, long time.  I don™t know, 
ma ybe he fi nd some body.  I don™t know.  I was two w
eeks his wife, that™s it.  I got back.  I me t 
him before they came, before they took us, he came
 to the ghetto.  I told you that.  But it was just 
that, nothing, no relationship, we just me t.  [L
aughing.]  And then he left the ghetto and five 
mi nutes later we were surrounded.  But he was tel
ling me  that, ﬁDon™t let you take them to the 
wagons.ﬂ  I didn™t know what he™s 
talking about.  He saw it on the 
way from Roma nia, of course, 
Romania, it was near the border there where th
ey were.  What they are doing, they™re putting 
people– and when the wagons came, I reme mb er
ed his words, I says, ﬁDon™t let you put 
yourself –ﬂ  Does he know that there are guns in
volved here?   He didn™t
 know that it was done 
with machine guns.  But he told me  that ﬁYou ar
e going to get a Christia
n birth certificate and 
you come  with me .ﬂ  It was true, everything.  I 
told you that I find the birth certificate here.  I 
didn™t know about it.  Last time when he was in
 Hungary he brought everything.  His sister was 
very sick for ten years, but her son- in-law is a 
doctor and he ke pt her alive.  Because he  was 
telling me  when we were there, if not me , shewouldn™t be  alive anymore.  Because the daughter 

was always hysterical and even from meetings she called him.  He was in a hospital like here, 

Walter Reed.  He was there, a pathologist, unde
r the Communism.  So, he had a big job.  And 
she called him, ﬁRight away come  and give moth
er injections,ﬂ she yelled.  And I was there 
when she did it.  And he right away left everyt
hing, came and gave her injections.  I think that 
she had liver cancer, that™s what I think.  B
ecause she had diabetes, di abetes, I don™t know 
whether it counts for me , that that family had di
abetes, but my father™s 
sister had diabetes in 
Russia.  So it was in the fa mily.  I always for
got about it and when they were asking me, ﬁDid 
anybody have it in the fa mily? ﬂ   And I always sa
y, ﬁI don™t know, they were killed when they 

were 45 years old.ﬂ  And I know my  grandmother 
didn™t have it.  I know the other sister didn™t 
have it.  At that time  I probably– I didn™t know 
even that his sister 
had it, because she was 
writing, my father, always to his sister.  And he 
translated the letters to
 us, but I didn™t think 
about it, you know, that she had it.  And now he 
was telling me , my cousin, that she had even a 
leg amputated because of diabetes.  So it is in 
my fa mily.  But I don™t know whether I got it.  I 

don™t know.  Because it was really, I had such a 
good doctor for 27 years and he never said that™s 
diabetes.  Only my periodontist always said that 
I have diabetes because 
of my gums.  It was 
always, he said, ﬁWhat are they talking about, yo
u have diabetes? ﬂ   And he always said, ﬁNo, 
you don™t have diabetes, it™s just el
evated because of the me di cations what you are taking.ﬂ  Here 
the urologist was arguing with me , that I don™t ha
ve– I had urinary tract in
fection.  And he said, 
ﬁYou don™t have diabetes.  What are they talking 
about?   Because it™s not 
in your urine.ﬂ  Would 
you believe  that?   We ll, anyway.  So then, when 
we lived in Eger, and we started to know each 

other.  And right away, I got pregnant, a month la
ter I got pregnant.  We  got very close and he 
was a very, very good man.  Very good.  He had such
 a heart.  He was so good.  He never said, 

like George, he never said nothing bad about nobody. 
 And he tried to help people and he was a 
person like, he worked in a hospital, and 
he– like nobody, you know– even in New York they 
don™t care about the Blacks.  He shook hands with
 the elevator ma n or whatever.  You know?   
He was unbelievable good.  Unbelievable.  And whenhe retired, even before he retired, he went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
53
 
 
without me  to Hungary, because I right away ha
d four weeks vacation wi
th the hospital.  And 
when he retired, he went every year back to Hunga
ry to see his sister.  Bu
t the ma in thing to see 
the children™s grave.  And one day I told him, 
ﬁListen Frank, you see I am the mother.  You think 
that I don™t think about them? ﬂ   
I says, ﬁYou go only to the stones. 
 You must realize it, that you 
go only to the stones.ﬂ  He  says, ﬁYes, but at leas
t I can fix up the letters if they are, you know, 
not in shape.ﬂ  They are not burie
d separate.  They are buried with
 my Uncle Joseph, in the same  
grave, the two little kids.  And then that was that 
reason, that he has an only sist er and she™s very 
sick.  And then when he was very sick, he had a 
terrible heart attack in 
‚81 and in ‚82, 17 months 
he lived.  And in between that he went to Hungar
y.  I said to the doctor, 
ﬁWhat shall I tell him, 
that he cannot go? ﬂ   He says, ﬁNo, he can go, 
but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to 
Hungary.  And he™ll be all right there because hi
s nephew is a doctor and he  will be ve ry safe 
there.ﬂ  And I called him every w
eek on the phone.  And he said, ﬁI™m fine, I™m fine.ﬂ  Three-
quarters of his heart was gone.  ﬁI am fine,ﬂ he sa
id.  And I always gave th
e report to the doctor.  
And he says, ﬁHe™s fine because pr obably he sees
 sicker people around hi m, and then he has the 
nephew thereﬂ.  And that was the reason, because 
when he came  back in July, end of June–  
every July we  were in the country
 for Ilona™s, Ilona was born July 3
rd ,
 and I left a week vacation 
for that, and we went to the country house, and 
he came back before that and he came with us 
and he was fine.  We  wa nted to go, all of us, to Ca na
da after.  It™s not clos
e, but it™s on the same  
highway to go to Toronto, where it
™s close, like a country house.  
It was a long ride, but still it 
was– I don™t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls.  We  wanted to all of 

us go, and he said, ﬁYou know what?  I came from
 a long trip now, I go home myself.  I drive 
home  myself.  And you go with them.ﬂ  Laura wa
s pregnant with Ana.  And he was so happy, 
because he always wanted a lot of children.  He
 was crazy for children.  And George was an only 
child, because the two others died.  And he always
, he was very happy.  He loved them so much.  
That™s the last picture from them
 be fore he left.  That was onl
y Jacob and Ilona.  And he– it was 
in April.  No.  No, because George took him to the ai
rpor t.  It was before he left.  He died in ‚82.  
While we were in Canada, he got sick and he we
nt himself to the hospital.  They took him in 
Intensive Care, Coronary Care, 
I don™t even know.  But I called hi
m when he was already home .  
And he said, ﬁBring a present to so and so.ﬂ  I 
says, ﬁWhy?ﬂ  He said, ﬁBecause he helped me .  I 
was in the hospital.ﬂ  So right away I packed and 
I went back.  And in August he died.  I wasn™t 
even around.  You know that story?   It was terr
ible.  He was so good.  And he was so worried 
about me , because when I was sick, he didn™t 
get undressed.  He was– the whole– because I 

had two heart attacks, in ‚67 and 
in ‚70.  So, it was always me they were worried about.  So, he 
was always, he didn™t get undressed and he wa
s– unbelievable nurse, you know?   He was very, 
very good.  And with the children, everything the
y– what we had, and every vacation they were 

always for those two children, be
cause they lived upstairs.  They
 lived in the same  house.  He 
loved them.  He loved George.  He loved them.  He
 was very upset that he ™s an artist, because he 
thought that, he always of the Hungarian artist,
 and he was always telling them, ﬁYou know how 
the artists are living?   They are going baref
oot because they don™t have money for they–ﬂ 
[Laughing.]  You know, he was alwa
ys worried.  But when he said  that ﬁDon™t worry, I am going 
to teach.ﬂ  Then he was very happy, and he was 
always the first one whom George called.  That 

ﬁI got tenure, I got even–ﬂ no, he wasn™t alive 
when he got full professor, only when he got 
tenure.  He was alive.  And he was very ha
ppy, and with every exhibition, though he didn™t like 
his paintings.  But he said he loves it, because he 
went from that kind of a, ultra-modern.  But he 
was supporting him.  And that wa
s everything for him, Geor ge was everything.  That™s why we 
bought the house there, that he should have a studi
o.  But he always said to
 him, ﬁIf you want to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
54
 
 
be a real artist, don™t get ma rried.ﬂ  But he wanted
 to be an artist, but he– I mean, he didn™t have 
no one else but us, that was a fa m
ily, so he wanted a family.  So he got married.  And he loves 
his children.  He™s a very good father, and he
™s very good to me , unbelievable good to me .  And 
nobody can understand it. 
 
Q: Why is that? 

 

A: His wife cannot understand it.  And I, I– because
 they don™t know what is it– we went once to 
a psychiatrist, because she was very jealous of
 his love towards me .  She c a nnot, she cannot 
understand it that some body can l
ove two people different way.  A
nd the psychiatrist explained it 
to me .  She would never understand it, because sh
e never got along with her mother.  She loved 
her father, and the mi nute her father died, she le
ft home.  So, she would never understand it.  So, 
I said to him, ﬁSo I am here, why I am here?   Y
ou won™t understand me  either.ﬂ  It was an Italian 
guy. I said, ﬁYou wouldn™t understand me .  Wha t  is 
it to be in the world alone?   Two of us, 
nobody, no family, just two of us.  Would you understand 
that? ﬂ   So he says, 
ﬁI didn™t know that, 
she didn™t tell that.ﬂ  The trouble was, I walked 
in, he said– walked in.  I was in wheelchair, 
because I fell on the st eps here.  18 steps, a
nd in the wheelchair I was forced to go to the 
psychiatrist.  And he said to me , whe n I walk
ed in, he says– Laura wa
sn™t there, we went 
together and separate.  And he says, ﬁHow 
ma ny t i me s your son called you when you were in 
New York? ﬂ  I says, ﬁThat™s the complaint? ﬂ  
I says, ﬁIf you are a good son–ﬂ You.  That™s how 
I talked to him, ﬁand your father would die, and 
your mother is alone in
 the world, you wouldn™t 
call her every night?   And I paid the telephone bill
s.ﬂ  So, that she was complaining that he™s 

calling me  every night when the father died. 
 And some ti me s saying, and it was some thing, no, 
between us and Ilona, which I thank God, Ilona– he
 always told me , ﬁYou can always count on 

Ilona.ﬂ  He loved Ilona.  Jacob 
was very little.  He  loved Jaco
b, but Ilona was six– ‚82 and she 
was born ™76, six years old.  So Ilona was alr
eady a bigger girl.  And she always said, ﬁYou 
always can count on Ilona.ﬂ  And I must tell you, he
 was always teaching me  if he die s, what is 
going to happen and how much I should divulge. I says, ﬁFrank, please don™t talk about that.ﬂ  

He says, ﬁI know I am going to die when I am 6
9.ﬂ  I says, ﬁWhat are you talking about? ﬂ   He 
says, ﬁBecause my uncle came home from hunting, 
he was fine, too.  And he dropped dead when 
he was 69.  And he had a heart attack,ﬂ so ev
ery nightŠI didn™t sleep
 ma ny nights with himŠ
every night he got shaved, he got dressed, and he
 was sleeping in that chair.  He was always 
prepared that he has to go to the hospital or so
me thing, after the heart att
ack.  It was terrible.  
And he was always teaching me  what to do and 
how to do it.  ﬁAnd I leave you enough,ﬂ he said, 
ﬁthat you can live like a pr
incess if you want to, but if you wa
nt to live with your daughter-in-
law–ﬂ

Tape 5, Side A 
 
Q: Okay, tape nu mber five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.  And you told on the other 
tape about your– how you got out of Hungary.  
And then you went to Vienna?   Can you talk 
about what you did in Vienna? 
 
A: You know how we got out from Hungary?   Th
at you know?   Okay.  In Vienna I worked for 
International Rescue Committee.  Their office 
was in New York, and it was there a boarding 
school in the Vienna woods.  
A Hungarian teacher was in Vi
enna from Ne w York, who came 
there, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, a
nd he wanted to help them to come  over.  And 
his idea was to ma ke a boarding school for th
e Hungarian refugee child
ren.  Those were all 
peasants™ children.  The parents 
got– is it on the ta
pe once already?   N
o. The peasants who 
came over and they got a contract in Sant
o Domi ngo, I don™t know how ma ny hundr eds, that 
they get land there and they can work there a
nd they get everything.  Food and everything.  And 
some how, some how, they couldn™t get in t
ouch with nobody, but some how the International 
Rescue Committee find out that they didn™t get noth
ing.  They  put them on the fields and they 
didn™t give them nothing.  So they managed to bring them back.  So, they brought them back to 

Vienna and the parents, they put to the two cam
ps .  And the children, for the children, who were 
young, school kids, young, elementary school kids, a
nd there were some  bigger ones, they ma de 
that boarding school.  It was a beautiful, beautiful
 place and it was like 
a palace in the woods.  
And he talked them into it, that he will be h
ead of the school.  And b
ecause they helped them 
anyway, the International Rescue Committee.  This
 way they can go to school.  So we had seven 
Hungarian teachers there.  And the young ones had sc
hool there.  And the older ones he took to 
the village, the first time I saw the– the Volksw
agen bus.  He had a Volkswagen bus.  He took 
them by bus  to German schools.  And they were
 looking for a person for the office, one person 
does everything.  And my– Ilona™s 
sister-in-law, who was alrea
dy in ViennaŠshe™s Ilona, too, 
both of themŠshe spoke and was always corres
ponding, that™s what she did, in German, French, 
English, Hungarian.  And she worked for his very, 
very– her very, very, ve
ry, very rich cousin, 
who– he was so rich that he lived in an apartmen
t in the mi ddle of Vienna with his wife and two 
children near the opera house where Franz Jo
sef, Franz Josef™s gi
rl friend lived.  And 
unbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor 
with the same furniture.  And he was in a 
business that time that started, I don™t know what ki
nd of electronics they started to ma ke.  And 
he was a big businessman.  He was in Hungary, 
too, but in time he went to Vienna.  And he 
worked in his office, she worked in his offi
ce.  And she didn™t get 
enough, she thought that she 
didn™t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job.  Because she has 

those, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too.  And they recomme nded her 

to that  job for International Rescue Committee.
  Because the International Rescue Committee 
was in connection with the– they were connected to the embassy, American Embass y.  And she 

got that job.  And when she said it to the cous
in that she™s leaving b
ecause she can get more 
money, the cousin said, ﬁI give you the same  mo ne
y.ﬂ  So then she wanted to stay, because she 

didn™t have to travel.  I had to tr
avel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in 
the woods.  And in the winter it wa
s terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work.  But anyway.  
So, she said, ﬁLook, go there and tell him that you ar
e my relative, and I have to give two weeks 
notice.  I cannot leave right away, 
I have to give note and I can fill 
it in for her.ﬂ  So right away 
he says, ﬁOka y.ﬂ  He give s me  a petty cash box w
ith money.  That was so funny because I wasn™t 
used to that kind of a thing.  And he told me  wha t  
is the job, that I have to do the payroll.  I have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
56
 
 
to pay the people.  I have to, I don™t know.  I ha
d to do the bookkeeping, but
 I never did.  I took it 
home  for my husband, because that
 was his job.  I hated bookkeep
ing.  And I never knew how to 
do it, but he graduated busine
ss school.  He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the 
bookkeeping.  He didn™t know.  But when it came– 
he didn™t know that I am taking it home .  
But when it came that I had to go with the Ge
rman– not accountant, who was he?   Gosh– he 
was an accountant, yes he  was an accountant.  And 
I had to give, where, what office, some where 
I had to go at the end of the year.  Because it™s 
the same  thing, taxes.  He says, ﬁWhat about? ﬂ   I 
couldn™t answer and I told him, ﬁI a m not doing 
it, my husband is doing it
.ﬂ [Laughing]  I told 
him.  He didn™t care about it.  But anyway tw
o weeks later when it was two weeks, he says, 
ﬁ Where is Mrs. Schwartz? ﬂ   Her name – I says, ﬁS
he decided to stay.  If you want to keep me , 
okay.  If not, thank you that you kept me .ﬂ  She sa
ys, ﬁYes, I want to keep you.ﬂ  That™s how I 
got the job and they paid me in American mone
y.  I got the– oh, the Germans didn™t want me .  
They didn™t want to give me  the– you had to have
 a certification th
at you can work there.  I was 
no citizen.  And they wanted the job.  So in 
the kitchen it was a German woma n, who was the 
everything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything.  She was a German 

woma n, but I was in the office.  And then he got
 it.  He got in touc
h with the Embassy and 
whatever and I got it.  I still 
have it, the okay that I can work.  And I got paid in American 
money.  It was– I don™t know, to 
me it seemed very much, becau
se it was–  I don™t reme mber 
how much I got.  But we didn™t live in a camp, we 
didn™t.  We lived in an apartment, we lived 
together with Ilona and her husband.  We  had toge
ther an apartment.  And George went to school 
and she took care of George.  And she took back 
and forth him to school.  And then in summer, 
George came with me  there, when it was summe
r vacation.  And they brought out there– they 

did everything for those kids.  Unbelievable.  A
nd they brought a German 
artist there to teach 
them art in the summer.  And George was, my 
George was in the group.  And the first time he 

painted a head on a piece of w
ood.  A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree.  And he 
painted it, oil painting.  And 
the guy came to me and he says, ﬁDo you know whom you have 
here? ﬂ   I says, ﬁWhat do you mean? ﬂ   He said, ﬁH
e™ll be a great artist.ﬂ  Ca n you imagine that?   

And then in New York, too, in elementary– he ca
me  to mi ddle school.  He didn™t lose nothing.  
He was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house.  And he said, ﬁDo you 

know–ﬂ the same  words.  I said, ﬁWhat are you 
talking about? ﬂ   He sa
ys, ﬁYou mu st come  to 
the principal with me .ﬂ  I went to the principal,
 and they showed me  his work, what is he doing.  
So, he wanted him to go to an art school in Ma
nhattan, a high school.  I 
don™t know what was the 
name  of it.  And we mi s understood it.  We  t
hought it was music and ar
t high school.  And we 
took him to music and art high school.  And it 
was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways, 
and that was, you know, it was so far away.  We re
 you in New York?   Yeah?   It was near the 
City University, behind City University, behind Co
lumbia University.  And he was traveling for 
four years, because he had a portfolio and they 
took him.  So he went already to music and art 

high school.  And he was really good.  And after th
at he went to Cooper Union, where they take 
only 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them.  And Cooper Union is free, you know, that™s a 

Foundation.  And we just had to pay for the ma terial
s, but we didn™t have to pay for his college.  

50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants.  He was amongst them.  So we finished that.  He never 

wanted to go out-of-town college .  He was accep
ted to Penn State University, and I don™t know 
where else he applied in case he ca
nnot get to Cooper.  But he neve
r wanted to leave us.  He said, 
ﬁ We didn™t come  to America to be separated.ﬂ  We 
were three of us, that™s 
it.  My uncle was still 
alive, but we were three of us.

Q: Tell me  something, did you talk
 to George about your fa mily hi
story, and what had happened to 
your fa mily during the Holocaust, and what had 
happened to you, from the time he was a child? 
 
A: He knows.  Everything.  First of 
all he knows, he listene
d to the tape.  I always talked about it.  
And he– someti mes I am mi xing it up, that it was my
 husba nd to whom I talked or to him.  But 
he knows it.  He knows it.  And I have writte
n down everything, but unf
ortunately I wrote it 
Hungarian and he cannot read it anymore, Hungari
an.  And I really have to write it over in 
English, though I have tapes and for every kids.  I 
think my whole lifetime is in the tapes, so I 

don™t know whether it™s important to write it down. 
 But no, Ana gave me a batch that I have to 
put down the whole family hist ory because they
 are making family trees, and for me, for my 
husband, for my husband™s sisters and everything, 
in the school.  She™s asking.  They are not 
aware of it, the grandchildren, just about the Ho
locaust.  He knew my hus band, they knew, all of 
them knew my husband.  Not all of them.  Ana didn™
t know.  Anna just alwa
ys saying that ﬁThat 
chair was grandpa™s and I want to save it.ﬂ  
They didn™t have really– they don™t know.   
 

Q: When you were in Vienna  were you waiting for a visa? 

 

A: Okay, that we didn™t know.  
It was a quota was over.  Closed. 
 They let in so ma ny people 
everywhere, that it was no open quota.  That™s why 
we had to stay in Vienna.  And we stayed 17 
months.  Aft e r 17 months they give for 1,000 pe
ople, and we were amongst the first ones 
because the International Rescue Committee took us
.  I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit, 
but we didn™t need it because they paid for 
us and they took us, the International Rescue 
Committee.  And we we re the very first ones.  Th
e interesting thing was th
at by that time , ma ybe 
half a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes 
(ph )
 was her name, wor king as 
a– over the housekeeping.  She didn™t do nothing act
ually.  She lived in 
the mi ddle of Vienna 
and she had a beautiful apartment, because we we
re there.  She invited us.  And she had a car, 
she came every, she wanted a job.  He r husband wa
s Jewish, and he was killed some where in 

labor camp.  And she lived alone.  She was a fa
t woma n.  And she had– he
r mother lived here, 

in New York.  But she stayed in Vienna and she 
lived a big life.  She had a big dog, I reme mber.  
And she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job.
  She wanted a job.  And she had a car and 

when she came , she picked me  up every day by ca
r and took me  home by car, so it was much 
easier on me .  But the interesting thing was that I ne
ver told her that I was in concentration camp.  
I never told her.  I some how, I don™t know, th
ey didn™t see the number and– I don™t know.  I 
never say, never told even that I was Jewish, to 
her.  He knew probably, he knew, of course he 
knew.  Haber was his name .  He was  a school teac
her in New York.  That was his idea.  And I 
don™t know what happened to him, and to the school
, too.  Of course it™s not there anymore.  
Habdersdorf 
(ph ) 
was the name  of the village.  And she,
 when we got the okay to come , we had 
to go to Salzburg, to the Embassy.  There was the 
American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes.  And 
so she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg.  It
 was a beautiful, beautiful road.  Unbelievable 
scenery.  And then when we parted, I told her 
that I am Jewish.  [Laughing.]  She knew that I 
was in concentration camp.  She didn™t know up to th
at point and she was ve
ry upset that I didn™t 
tell her before that I was in con
centration camp.  I never told anybody. 
 

Q: Did you not tell anybody because you were afraid or–?

A: I never– I was very uncomfor
table in Vienna.  When we firs
t, it was May when we got there 
and beautiful and we had– already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came.  My 
uncle™s brother arranged.  And he was a Jewish 
man, who was saved in Singapore.  He went with 
his son to Singapore.  A very interesting ma n andhe lived alone, an elderly ma n.  And he had a 

pretty nice big apartment.  And he had only one 
room for hi mself, and he gave two rooms and 
the kitchen to us.  And so we were there and the windows were open.  And when I got up in the 

morning and I heard the German language under th
e window, I got so crazy.  I went crazy.  My 

husband couldn™t get a job.  He didn™t speak Germa
n.  He couldn™t get a job, but they gave him 
some  kind of a– oh, no.  When we left I got a 
letter from the International Rescue Committee 
that when we arrive we should go to New York, to 
their ma in office and show them the letter that 
I work for them.  And we  got a couns
elor there, and we went in and 
I give him the letter.  I didn™t 
say nowhere, it doesn™t say nowhere 
that story?   I gave him the le
tter, and he looks at me  and 
says, ﬁI don™t believe it that you don™t reme mber me .ﬂ  I says, ﬁI™m so sorry, how do you know 

me ? ﬂ   She says, ﬁI was in the school there. 
 They came some , observe
 the school from New 
York, the International Rescue 
Committee.  Don™t you reme mber I was there with my wife and I 
was in one car with you going back to Vienna? ﬂ   
Then I reme mbered.  I didn™t even think about 
it, you know, that is somebody.  So, he was very ni
ce.  He said, ﬁYou don™t 
have to show me  the 
letter, I know what you did there, but I must 
tell you, you did there everything.  But in America 
you have to do one thing, and good, not so ma ny th
ings what you did there in the office.  I™m 
going to send you to NCR school.ﬂ  When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn™t– you know?   I 

didn™t say no, but I didn™t go, when he told me  to
 go to.  Wh at happened, I didn™t know that, I got 
pregnant.  And I know it™s that I 
got pregnant in Salzburg.  I reme mb
er it, but I didn™t know that I 
got pregnant.  I didn™t know.  I had my period ev
ery month and I didn™t know that I™m pregnant.  
And three months later I 
started to bleed like terribly and I di
dn™t know that I™m pregnant.  And I 
went to the doctor and he  said you are pregnant , 
but you are going to have  a mi scarriage, because 
you have fibroids.  So, I didn™t 
go to International School.  And 
he called me  on the phone and 
he called me  when I came back from the hospital.
  And I says, ﬁI was sick, and that™s what 
happened.  I had a mi scarriage,ﬂ I told him.  ﬁA
nd I couldn™t go.ﬂ  But when I was better, they 
kept me , I was in the fourth month, and they ke
pt me  there five days.  They thought every day 

the babies, four months.  I was dying there.  I lo
st so much bl ood.  But then finally they did it.  
And they said that ﬁYou have to come  back in 
six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.ﬂ  
And six weeks later I went back and they said, 
ﬁNo you don™t need it.  It
 was so big, everything 
because you were pregna nt.  You don™t need a hyst
erectomy.ﬂ  So then I went back.  When he 
called me , I  said, ﬁNo, I can™t go now.ﬂ  So he 
sent me  to NCR school.  NCR was not the cashier 
machines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know.  They had big, big bookkeeping 

machines, before the computers.  Big bars, re
changeable that you coul
d do everything.  You 
could go, big papers with monthly statements a
nd you could go checks.  Ot
her side I could put 
the vendor™s card and put down to whom I am pa yi
ng.  And I went there a
nd I learned it in one 
week.  Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, 
ﬁYes, I can type.ﬂ  So they taught me  for the 
machine in one week and they gave me  a job aft e
r one week.  I didn™t have any experience, but I 
knew how to do the ma chine.  And they gave me
 a job in a publishing 
company in Manhattan, 
Columbus Square or Circle or wh
at was it.  And I had to travel 
from Brooklyn.  I was so sick on 
the subways that I was more in the doctor™s office 
than at home .  It was terrible.  I cannot, even 
in Hungary what is above the ground I was always 
standing outside on the air.
  I couldn™t travel.  
And that was underground and was going on in New Yo
rk subways.  It was terrible.  And that 
was a publisher, who ma de some  kind of a– I 
don™t know whether it was comi c books or what it

was, I have no–  Publishing compa ny.  And they 
were two machines, it was a receivable and a 
payable.  And I was the payable and the other guy, a guy, a young guy, who was very helpful.  
And he tried to teach me, because I knew the ma
chine, but I didn™t have experience.  I didn™t 
have the speed, first of all, and if I made a mi st
ake, I didn™t know how to correct it.  And he was 
very, very helpful.  But the comptroller– not co
mptroller, liked me very much, the co mptroller, 
but the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I 
didn™t know from my 
life.  I didn™t know 
where is Massachusetts [l aughing],  and he was so 
proud of it, that he is from Massachusetts.  He 
was a mi sery.  And he was a Jew.  And he ma de
 my life, he  got back the checks from the bank, 
what I was typing.  And he found mi stakes.  He wa
s so mi se rable and he said to me , ﬁYou just 
came.  You are a refugee, and you 
right away have to sit in an office? ﬂ  Can you ima gine?   A 
Jew.  I was very mi serable.  It was 60 dollars a 
week, what was a nice pa y at that time.  And they 
gave me  even commissions.  I don™t know what wa
s it, from sale or some thing.  I was there for 

three months and I was constantly looking for a
nother job.  And one day 
from New York Times, 
I see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospit
al is looking for an NCR opera
tor.  They were on strike 
because they were already– the half, not the 
office, but the kitche
n and the– I don™t know, 
cleaning people, they were in the Union.  And 
they had a strike.  The office, too, because nobody 
could, they had a black ma n working years on that 
machine, and he left because he got a better 
job under the strike.  And they 
didn™t have no one for three m
onths.  They had young girls, but 
they left.  Young people don™t want to sit and work. 
 You had to sit at the machine.  So, when I 
saw that, it was in walking distance from us, th
e hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning, 
my uncle™s pharmacy.  So he came always earlier 
to open that he should see me  in the morning 

when I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance.  And I never thought 

that I stay there.  A
nd the comptroller wasn™t– was out of
 town or I don™t know where.  He 
wasn™t there when I got the job.  So the personne
l, she gave me the job.  And I was working, it 
was a big office and we had two ma c hines likethere, accounts payable 
and receivable.  The 
receivable wa s another woma n working.  And the co
mptroller came back and he called me  to the 
office and he greeted me  and he was very, verynice to me .  And he said, ﬁI must tell you one 

thing, if you do the job by Christma s–ﬂ  they we
re behind three months with bills.  Well I saw 
those bins with bills.  ﬁIf you do it by Christma s, 
the job is yours.ﬂ  So I started to do it and I 
started to be very fast on the machine, very fa
st.  And I did it day befo
re Christma s.  So, but 
wome n there, they were Jewish women, they were ve
ry jealous.  One of them, first of all I never 
spoke about concentration camp.  Never.  It was 
mi xed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and 
I never spoke to them about it.  And one woma
n, a Jewish woma n, she said to me , ﬁWhy did you 
come  to America? ﬂ  This way.  I says, ﬁ What 
do you mean? ﬂ   He says, ﬁWhy, the communis m is 
not enough good? ﬂ  I says, ﬁMaybe it is good for 
you because you have a house, every child of 

you has a car and you have a nice job.  You could ch
ange place with me ,ﬂ I said.  [Laughing]   
Can you ima gine that?   She was a Leftist.  And sh
e didn™t work on a machine, but she worked in 
the office.  That time it was everything togeth
er, the billing.  We ha
d a big, big office and 
machine and no machine.  The machi nes were in
 the back.  And then 
there was another woma n, 
who was like that ma n there, who was controlling 
me  and she was mi serable, too.  If I ma de a 
mi stake, she was mi serable.   And I was crying, a
nd I went to the Compt r oller and I says, ﬁI just 
don™t know what to do.ﬂ  She says, ﬁWhat™s happen
ing? ﬂ  And I told him what™s happening.  He 
says, ﬁYou come  to me , you don™t go to them.  
If you don™t know some thing you come to me .ﬂ  
It was a man.  And from then on, I was all right.
  I had trouble because
 I ha d to answer the 
telephone.  I was payable and the vendors were 
calling me .  So, in the beginning I had big 
trouble.  I spoke English, but I spoke English, not
 Yankee.  Because I learne d English fr om an

English teacher in Czechoslovakia when it was H
ungary already and we thought that we come  to 
America.  We had private lessons
.  And my sister was very, very
 smart.  And we were reading 
Anna Karenina in English and– I told you, no?   
That story.  So we l
earned English.  And we 
didn™t understand each other on 
the phone, you know?   [Laughing.]  So in the beginning I had 
problems, but then it was okay.  Even the Amer
icans came to me , how do you spell that, how do 
you spell this?   You know?   That was the end.  But 
I never thought that I stay
 there 27 years.  I 
stayed there 27 years.  I went 
through ma ny comptrollers.  [La
ughing.]  He left, but he was a 
long time there.  But he left.  And then one da
y the Personnel Director come s in, closes the door 
and he says, ﬁAttention, please.ﬂ  Everybody looks 
up, ﬁWha t is it? ﬂ  He says, ﬁI must announce 
it, that from yesterday on, ev
erybody is in the Union.ﬂ  So I 
didn™t know what does it me an and 
why is it good or bad, just in 
the Union.  Fine.  I don™t carewhere we are.  And it was an 
unbelieva ble advantage.  I was the highest paid 
because of the machines.  So, if some body got 
three dollars pay and 
raise, I got five dollars ra
ise.  From 60 dollars in one year, because I started 
with 60 back there in the other pl ace, I went up 
to 125 dollars because of the Union.  And thank 
God, because of the Union, I have a pension to
day from the Union, and I have free medication. 
My me dication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, be
cause they are sending me  the company™s and 
that™s anothe r pension, 4,000 dollars.  And I am 
getting pension.  And because– oh, that™s the 
story.  Before I– a year before I left, it was an
ot he r strike.  And I didn™t go to work, because I 
was afraid.  You know?   Crossing th
e picket lines.  But I never picketed, never.  I was in the 
country for a month, it was a month strike.  And 
I was in touch with them.  I called always 
Personnel.  Personnel wa s begging me , ﬁPlease come
 back.ﬂ  Because by that time we had only 
one machine, it was no more receivable because th
ey gave it out to computers.  So, I was the 
only machine and the only person who knew the m
achine.  They were typing checks, the people 
who were non-Union.  And it was horrible, horrible,
 they were behind, and 
terrible.  And he was 
begging me, ﬁPlease come back.  Come back, 
don™t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.ﬂ  And 
they were in the country and one
 day he calls me and he says, ﬁCome back.  We are going to 
send you a Black girl down for you if you are af
raid.  We  are watching you when you when you 
are comi ng.  And please come  back.ﬂ  And they we nt to the country and they dropped me  off and 
they are watching it whether I go i
n.  It was no picketing.  It was 
no picket line anymore.  And I 
went in and then everybody was shocked, becau
se nobody knew that I am not in the Union.  I 
couldn™t have, I couldn™t, I don™t know.  It was–
 they just didn™t belie
ve it that I am, you know, 
in the Union, in the Union, the people.  Because 
that was a job what was a confidential job, with 
the payroll and everything.  So they didn™t believe it that I am in the Union.  So, what happened, 

the person–

Tape 5, Side B 
 
 
A: –you get out from the Union.  They didn™t know that
 I am close to retirement.  That I wanted to 
retire.  I didn™t know either.  If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and 

you get me dication from the hospital, doctors from
 the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year.  
I said, ﬁHow do I do that?ﬂ  He sa ys, ﬁI™m goi
ng to send a telegram,ﬂ because the Union was 

threatening us, that if we are st ill on strike th
ey are not going to cover us medically.  Because 
they had very good me dical coverage.  Every doc
tor wanted you if you were in the Union.  I 
says, ﬁI cannot live without me dical coverage.ﬂ  
She says, ﬁOkay so I™m going to tell them that 
you cannot be without coverage a
nd you are out fr om the Union.ﬂ  
So, for one year, I went out 
from the Union.  Then after a year
, I wanted to retire.  I worked 
one year more than 65, 66 I was 
when I left.  And I says, ﬁCan you put me  back to
 the Union? ﬂ  Because they would have to give 
me  a pension from the hospital if I am not in 
the Union.  So the personnel, the secretary, his 
secretary, arranged it that they 
paid me  for one year dues, for 
one year everything, because they 

paid for me dical for us, the Union.  And they paid for pension.  I paid the bills, hundreds of 

thousands of dollars to the Uni
on.  I was paying them.  And they said that it was a mi stake and 
they got me  back to the Union.  Can you imagine?  
 It was such a luck because I wouldn™t have 
the Union.  I wouldn™t have the pension because 
they say to me– I™m talking to some people 
fr om the hospital, ﬁIt™s terribl e, it™s almost ba
nkrupt.ﬂ  We  wer e  bankrupt after ten years, we 
went to Chapter 11.  I we nt to, through with th
em, voided thousands and thousands of checks and 
everything after ten years.  And they had to me rg
e with another hospital.  It was St. Joseph– St. 
John™s.  Here is St. Joseph™s.  St. John™s Hospita
l.  And then we got more , we were the ma in 
hospital.  We got more employees.  It was 3,000 pe
ople.  And we paid everything.  We paid they 

bills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, ev
erythi ng.  It was everyt hing through us.  So it 
was a very bi g job.  But I had a separate room 
because the machine was very noisy.  And I was 
alone in the room, so that was very good.  And 
they always wanted me to be a manager and I 
didn™t want  to because I knew that 
I am out of the Union if I am a manager.  I says, ﬁI do the job.  
I am not a manager.ﬂ  So, I was lucky. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you a couple of questions before 
we go on because we skipped your journe y to the 
Uni t e d St at es. 
 

A: My journey to the United States?  We came 
in 1958.  The International Rescue Commi ttee from 
Salzburg brought us– Oh.  That was 
a very terrible thing, too.  Th
ey send us for x-rays, chest x-
rays before you come .  And they didn™t want me
 let through.  I™m sorry, stomach.  They didn™t 
let me  go through because they said that I have  some thing on my lungs.  It turned out that I had 

pneumonia in the camp and I didn™t know about it
 and it showed.  And they said, ﬁThey can go, 
your husband and your son, but you have to go on another plane, because it™s some thing.ﬂ  I 

went crazy.  They didn™t want to
 go without me , but luckily they called me for a second x-ray 
and that was all well.  That was okay, so we came together .  But we came on a military plane.  I 

don™t know how ma ny hundreds of people, and so uncom
fortable, and we were sitting in the last 
row, near the toilet.  And they were only two seat
s, so we always changed.  One sits with George 
and then the other one wa s sitting alone, you know?  
 But we were sitting in the same  row, but 

between us the aisle.  Very uncomfortable, very.  
I think we we re 24 hours in the air.  It was just 
terrible.  And we stopped at Newfoundland, Newfoundland.  And then they gi
ve us there the first

meal, a dinner.  And from that I got so sick, 
that the whole journey to
 New York, it was just 
unbelievable.  I was so sick.  But I was pregnant
 and I didn™t know, ma ybe 
that™s why I was sick 
from the food.  So when we arrived, it was th
at time  Kennedy Airport– no, La Guardia, I™m 
sorry.  La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport.  And 
we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting 
for us and waving.  And we saw the first Black
 man in our lives.  They had a postman, who 
delivered the ma il and he had a car.  And my
 unc le, he came always– he had like here in 
pharmacies they have a counter where you have food, 
too.  It was so strange to me , because there 
is no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies.  Phar
macy is pharmacy.  And he was telling him that 
if he has a free day, that he is going to pay him ta
ke him to the airport and wait for us.  So he was 

a fat man and it was the fi rst time in my life th
at I saw a black ma n.  And he was taking us home 
to my uncle.  They lived not very far from
 the pharmacy.  Though the house was theirs, the 
pharmacy was one day apartments.  They lived in a separate apartment.  And he had a partner 

because hi s diploma– I have still hi s Russian dipl oma, was not certificat ed, so he had an 

American partner.  Very nice people.  They lived 
in the house, in the upstair
s in the house.  They 
were very good friends.  They didn™t have childr
en, and they didn™t have children.  They were 
very good friends.  He was a very nice ma n.  And so
 we were three days in our uncle™s house.  It 
was only, what they had, the living room is a bi
g, big.  Bedroom they had, and a living room, a 
kitchen.  It was a private, private house.  I 
don™t know, bathroom, nothing el
se.  They had two in 
the house, two apartments in the ho
use, the landlord and them.  A
nd they rented for us, in that 
kind of a house, but in another stre
et, an apartme nt, upstairs.  But it was small.  It was just a 
bedroom and a little living room and at the e
nd of the living room was the kitchen, a small 
kitchen with a small fr igidaire.  
So, that was our first apartment. 
 And that was our street where 
George went to mi ddle school. 
 

Q: What were your first impressions of 
the United States, and what did you expect? 
 
A: I was very upset when they showed us pict
ures fro m New Yo rk at th
e Embassy.  I says, ﬁMy 
God, stones and stones and stones.  It™s no green 
nowhere.ﬂ  They showed us New York in the 
embassy.  It was very frightening. When I went very, very first time to Manhattan, I couldn™t 
believe  it.  I couldn™t look up because I was dizzy 
from the tall houses, but I loved it.  I love New 
York and that™s the place where I 
lived most of my life.
  Wh en I added up one day where I lived 
the longest, it was New York.  And I love New Yor
k.  I loved it.  We  lived in Brooklyn, near the 

ocean.  I love the ocean.  I love the ocean in th
e Spring and in the Fall.  I don™t like to go in 
because the mob was there, it™s unbelievable.  
But to walk on the Boardwalk, the sundown, the 
sunset, it was so relaxing.  It was wonderful. 
 And they were benches, you know, and we were 
sitting on it.  It was unbelievable, and I mi ssed it 
here very, very much when I came here.  When 
I came here I knew Lexington, because he™s here
 for ‚79, 1979.  And three times a year I was 
here.  I ha d four weeks vacation, three weeks he
re and one week in the country house, that 
country house in the Catskills.  My husband love
d it because he loved the 
country.  He  loved it.  
He loved it here.  When he saw the horses, and we
 wanted to retire here
.  We ca me  here and 
always looking for places where– we wanted a d
uplex.  We  a l ways thought it™s enough, we are 
together and separate.  But for them it was ne
ver enough, the duplex.  For us it would be, they 
are small apartments.  But anyway it didn™t come  to it, because he died.  But he wanted to live 

here.  I loved the big cities.  I never lived 
in a small town, because where we lived in 
Czechoslovakia, that was the capita
l of that part.  And Budapest 
is beautiful.  So I couldn™t

63
 
 
imagine to live– and they was always questioni ng where is the city here?  Where is the city?  
[Laughing]   
 

Q: You mean in Lexington? 

 

A: Here, yeah, but you go to– then they showed 
me downtown.  I says, ﬁO
h my God.ﬂ [Laughing.]  
Okay.  But I knew where I™m comi ng.  But still when
 I came here really, that this is now real, I 
thought I go to the nuthouse.   
 

Q: When you came to Lexington? 

 

A: When I moved here.  Wh en I moved here in 
November of ‚86.  And I was very upset.  I was 
home sick.  So the first year, they
 went every year back to the su
mmer house.  Every year they 
spent there and I went with them.  It™s half
 of mi ne, from the summer house.  My husband 
bought it for me  and them, half.  But we paid th
eir half with cash because they didn™t have 
money at that time, they just st arted teaching and th
ey gave us the credit.  So we paid they half 

cash and they paid the other half out in ten years. 
 And it™s in the Catskills.  It™s a beautiful place.  
It™s a small house, but it was very nice.  We  
have two bedrooms and in between us was the 
bathroom and the living room a
nd upstairs it was a big, big at
tic and it was ma de up for a 
bedroom, but we didn™t need it.  Because we were
 four only.  They didn™t have even children at 
that time, ‚73.  And even in the winter we went up. 
 It was beautiful.  It was very close to all the 

skiing place, all the people.  It™s very nice. 
 And he wouldn™t se ll it, because he™s very 

sentimental, because Daddy loved it.  He would neve
r sell it, and he loves it because he is away 
from here and he is going up four or five, it™s 
three acres, hill.  And unde
rneath there is a big, big 
library, that™s our neighbor.  It™s a library for four
, five towns, five little towns.  A big library.  
And–  
 

Q: Let me  ask you some thing before we go on.  Y
ou described how when y
ou arrived in New York 
and there were some  people who, some  even Jewi
sh people who were not very respectful of you.  

Did you find that to be common?  
 That American Jews did not treat you respectfully because you 
were a refugee and because you were a survivor? 
 

A: Yes, correct.   

 

Q: Can you say more about that? 

 

A: Especially here, here never were refugees in 
Lexington.  Not Jewish, or 
Jewish or not Jewish.  
They never were refugees here in Le xington.  
And then up to today, I must tell you.  You are 
friends with the people in the synagogue.  They 
are not real friends.  You are friends in the 
synagogue.  There we socialize, bu
t they wouldn™t invite you to th
eir houses, even here.  Yes.  
And what I found out, I found out that almost 
everybody™s fathers came from Europe.  Those 
people who are here 30 years or whatever– ever
ybody™s, but still they ar
e Lexingtonians.  And 
it™s very interesting.  I don™t ca
re, because just now I have onl
y two friends, a lawyer and his 
wife, and from Wi nchester, Sylvia.  But she is
 again from the synagogue, because I don™t go to 
Wi nchester.  And I went when her husband died, I 
went to see her a few time s, but otherwise I™m 
not driving outside of Le xington. 
 I™m glad I find my way here.  And so, she calls when they

know that I™m sick.  But I really don™t have fr
iends here.  And another couple, who is a Polish 
couple, the Habers.  You™ve
 were there?   No.   
 
Q: I™ve spoken with them.   

 

A: But they are very nice.  Last week she ma de a 
party, it was her birthday.  
And I couldn™t ma ke it,  
I was so sick.  Because in the beginning we ma
de , we went to each other™s houses and we had a 
book club.  Everybody read the same book and we 
discussed it, book discussion club.  That 
woma n died.  That was a pharmaco
logist™s wife.  And since she 
died, I am not going.  I am not 
going.  I could.  It™s the Haddassa
h.  You know what™s the Ha ddassah?   They have it, but I don™t 
like those people because they– I don™t like them because they went away from the synagogue 

and they have their own congregation, the Ha
varah.  And I cannot see that.  And in the 
beginning, when George moved here, they were so
 friendly to him.  They wanted to get him 
there.  And he would never go.  Because they ha
ve here a rabbi, who was blind.  He was a very 
nice ma n.  He died from diabetes, fairly young. 
 And he– I don™t like those people, because 
when they found out that George doesn™t want 
to belong there, it was finished with the 
friendship.  You know?   But when they come  some
ti me s to the synagogue or whatever, they are 
nice to you.  You know?   But they have their own 
clique, only Havarah, but they are none of 
them from Lexington.  They are everybody from some
wheres else.  And they feel that they are 
together  and they help each other.  And it™s a 
bigger, ther e are 80 fa milies now there.  They are 
always bigger and bigger.  They
 don™t have a place where to pra
y.  They pray, I think, once a 
month or twice a month, I don™t know and always
 someplace else.  In the Christian church 
baseme nt or some place.  They don™t have a steady 
place.  Some ti me s they pray here, too.  Pray 
here in the club.  But I really don™t have no frie
nds.  Besides the three people and the librarian 
from the synagogue, she™s very nice.  Bu
t we don™t go to each other™s houses.   
 
Q: So, you think that pe
ople are prejudiced? 
 

A: Yes, they are, they are, definitely they ar
e.  They are very nice to you in the synagogue, you 
know.  But nobody would say, ﬁCome.ﬂ  And the rabbi 
was different.  We we
re always over.  I 
was always invited, because they used to go t
oo, and I didn™t want to go with them, like for 
Passover, to Indiana.  His best friend is there, 
from New York, best frien
d.  And I didn™t want to 
go, so I was always invited to Rabbi.  Some times 
with Ilona when she was here for Passover, but 

not to other people™s.  So it is.  
They are.  I think th
ey are.  It™s unbeliev
able.  In the beginning 
we had here big parties, because they came here, like guest speakers and they wanted to take 

them to homes.  I don™t know why they choosed us
 about two or three times and they me t here.  

And we contributed.  We  ma de the cookies and 
cakes and everything.  And one couple came, he 
is very wealthy.  And he™s a nice guy.  He™s ni
ce to me , very nice, in the synagogue, but they 
came and they looked around.  And I see that they are looking around themselves, you know?    

They were away from the other people.  And 
I said, ﬁDo you want to see the house? ﬂ  And she 
says, ﬁOh, you are acting like it wo
uld be your house,ﬂ she said,he said.  I says, ﬁYes, my 
money™s in that house.ﬂ  They thought that it
™s– because it™s on their 
name.  Me idiot.  
[Laughing]  My friend, I have a pediatrician friend, a woma n.  She doesn™t know up to today, 

that it™s _______.  She said to me , ﬁDon™t you dare 
to do it, that it™s not only your name  and 
George™s.  You ma de the money for it.ﬂ  Th
at I put it on their na
me.  I trusted them. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005

Q: Tell me  something else, have you– 
 

A: And that™s what I think, you know?  That™s how they are.  That™s 
the first and last time they were 
here, because it was a party for some body.  And onthe rabbi™s wife™s birthday, not this rabbi.  

Another.  We had a rabbi who is from England.  Rabbi Smith 
(ph )
, he™s still here.  He works for 
the State Departme nt now.  Because they– he 
was three years rabbi.  He couldn™t handle 
children.  He doesn™t have children. 
 And he is so smart that he is too smart for them.  Very, very 
smart man.  So– 
 

Q: Comi ng back to when you first arrived in Am
erica and you™re getting settled, did you consider 
yourself–what did it take to become  an American for you? 
 

A: No, no, no, no.  I right away, when we were, righ
t away, five years later, we were citizens, 
because you have to be fi ve years.  No, I felt at
 ho me .  I felt at home, and we had our friends.  
We had our friends.  We  had a lot of friends.  We
 had friends, Hungarian friends, of course, they 
were Hungarians.  Some  of them ca me  here fr
om, from Aus t ralia and th
en we me t here.  And 
then we an association, Budapest.  Every city
 had an association and we got once a month 
together in Manhattan.  They ha
d five o™clock teas.  And of 
c ourse, the end was always the 
Holocaust, talking about the Holocaust, because al
most all of them were in Holocaust, you know, 
there.  So, I felt very well.  I felt– yeah.  Th
e last six months when I left, when I was alone 
there, my husband died, I was there four more
 years alone and then they– _______–  ﬁGeorge, 
when are you comi ng? ﬂ  I me t a woma n, who wa
s my age exactly and he worked– I told you 
that too?   He worked, she worked in Manhattan 
in the jewelry section.  She was an American.  
And she didn™t live very far from us.  And I went ev
ery week, I went to the theater.  I said it?  I 
told that story?   But we had private buses and th
ey went certain hours, because I didn™t want to 
go by train.  And I didn™t drive to
 Manhattan.  She was going to the same  beauty parlor as me  
and she was sitting near me .  And 
one day I hear that she™s talking 
about it that she was in Alaska 
and whatever, but still I didn™t talk
 to her.  Maybe I am not frie
ndly.  I am not talking to people 
whom I don™t know, but I overhea
rd everything.  But she notice
d– yeah, I go to the bus and I 
am waiting on the bus.  And she lived in that st
reet where the bus stop was and she went to 
Manhattan, too.  And she said to me , ﬁ Where are you 
going? ﬂ   It™s first time  she spoke to me .  I 
said, ﬁI am going to the theater.ﬂ  She says, ﬁAlone?ﬂ  I says, ﬁYes, my husband died and I™m 

going alone.ﬂ  She said, ﬁMy God, would you get me  
a ticket, too?   For next performa nce? ﬂ  I 

says, ﬁWhy not? ﬂ   She said, ﬁBecause I am alone, too.  My husband died.ﬂ   And I said, ﬁ Where 

do I leave the ticket? ﬂ  She said, 
leave it with my beautician when
 you go the beauty parlor.  And 
I left the ticket, and from then on we became 
good friends.  And every week we went together, 
but not by bus.  I was driving.  I know how to dr
ive, but she didn™t have a car.  She knew where 

to go, but I knew how.  And we went by car.  And 
there was the parking under the theater and it 
paid.  Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it™
s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars, 
parking under the theater.
  And after that we went always 
to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a 
wonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a ga
rden restaurant, where they had coffee and 
cake.  After that we went up, and we were very
 good friends, but it was only six months because 
six months later I came.  And her son was a ma
nager of the Days Inn Hotel in Manhattan.  And 
when we we nt, first time when we went to the co
untry, first year, and I wa
s very, very home sick 
for New Yor k and I was depressed and I was cr
ying in the country.  And George said, ﬁDo you 
want to go to the city? ﬂ   I says ﬁYes.ﬂ  So, 
I called her up and her son gave us a suite for 25

dollars and we stayed there for th
ree days.  And he went to the museum right away.  And I went, 
I think, with Laura to Fift h Avenue.  I don™t know.  
And I think that Ilona went with him, yes, to 
the museum.  And we stayed there three days.  A
nd then again, one time I went only with Ilona.  
I stayed there a week.  And I in
cluded her always, the woma n for th
e theater, and they gave us a 
dinner there, for the– I reme mber before we le
ft and she was there too, you know, in the hotel.  
And we had a very good time, but it was only for six 
months.  I met her late.  I mean I saw her, 
but I didn™t know who s he was and because I was th
ere four years alone.  And she was alone four  
years, too.  And she was retiring, too, the same
 time .  She worked 20, 27 years, too.  Can you 
imagine that?  So it was late. 
 
Q: Tell me  something else, you me ntioned early 
on that soon after you arrived you saw your first 
black ma n.  And that was near the time, just 
around the time  when the Civil Rights moveme nt 
was starting.  But tell me , were you surprised about the way that blacks were treated in this 

country? 
 

A: In New York weren™t treated bad, but here, wh
en he came here, the blacks were sitting in the 
back of the bus.  That I couldn™t imagine.  It 
was no sales ladies black, no one.  I didn™t see no 
one black, they were all separate.  It was unbe
lievable.  And what was the most unbelievable 
thing, everybody wore sneakers.  In the subway
s, too.  And we said, ﬁThey don™t have shoes 
here?   Everybody™s wearing sneakers.ﬂ  We
 couldn™t understand that.  Everybody in the 
morning.  And then we saw people who went to bi
gger offices to work.  They had they shoes in 
they bags, because if you have to wait for a bus
 and, ma ny time s I was wa
iting with hi gh heels 
and I said, ﬁMy God, I wish I would wear sneakers
,ﬂ you know?   When I we
nt to the city I was 
wearing always high heels.  Because in the office 
I was wearing always high heels.  And that was 
the custom.  We couldn™t understand.  That was 
the most unbelievable thing when we went on 
the subway that everybody is in white sneakers.
  We didn™t know about
 the segregation.  We  
didn™t know in Hungary about it.  
We didn™t, we didn™t have blacks.
  We  didn™t.  Oh, I™m sorry.  
I saw the first black ma n in the English Army. 
 I saw a soldier.  And it wasn™t even– I don™t 
know whether he was in the English army.  It™s
 interesting, they were taking us by jeep to 
Nuremberg from Bergen-Belsen.  And another je
ep came and they were throwing to us from 
their jeep, oranges.  And it was a black soldier.  Th
at was the fi rst one.  Not the fi rst one.  Yes, 
that was the first one.  But I just didn™t notice 
it, color, color– it was no difference to me .   
 

Q: I just wondered if, because you had come  from 
a situation where the discrimi nation was, was, 
had such an effect.  Whe t her you expectedsome thing different in
 this country?    
 

A: I didn™t know what to expect here.  I knew just
 I have an uncle here.  I didn™t know what to 
expect.  I didn™t.  The very, very bad experien
ce was the very, very first time  when we  had a 

bigger apartment and Ge orge with the school was 
supposed to go to the Shakespearean play with 
the school to Connecticut.  And he come s home
 a nd he had a friend, who was a very tough guy.  
He was Hungarian.  And he was with him, pr
obably, I don™t know.  And 
a  black boy started to 
hit George.  And he hit him in his mo uth.  He lo
st a tooth and he was bl
eeding and he couldn™t go 
to the show.  That was the very, very first ti
me  when I said, ﬁOh my
 God, what is going on 
here? ﬂ   In Brooklyn.  It was on th
e corner where we lived.  So th
en I said, ﬁOh my God.ﬂ  You 
know?   I didn™t know nothing about it
.  It was a very strange thing. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
67
 
 
Q: Did you understand the reason 
why it had happened?    
 
A: I think that they wanted the other boy, because
 he was a very tough guy.  He was wearing always 
boots and he had a knife in his boot.  So, he
 was his bodyguard. [Laughing.] After that when it 
happened, he  was always with him.  Because I didn™t know why it happene d, because he is 

white.  I didn™t know.  But then I knew, you know, when it happened then I knew that ma ybe– 

but ma ybe they knew the other guy and they want
ed him and they– he was weak.  I don™t know.  
I don™t know, but I felt terr
ible.  I felt terrible. 
 

Q: Did you feel a little bit, 
was it, did you feel a little
 bit of prejudice after that? 
 

A: No, I didn™t.  I tell you why, because I worked with
 blacks in the hospital.  My best friends were 
blacks, who are still cal
ling me .  But not New Yorkers.  They
 were from Barbados, from Ja ma ica 
and they are different.  They are entirely diffe
rent.  New York blacks are no good.  They are no 

good.  They are.  They are no good.  But those 
people,  I don™t know whether they are more 
educated or why, but they were 
entirely different.  And we ha
d– oh, that story is interesting, 
too.  We  had New Yorkers, too, there and they hated each ot he r.  The Jama icans and the 

Barbadians, they hated the New York blacks in th
e office.  In the big accounting office.  So it 
was a big hatred between them.  And oh gosh, one
 had two daughters and one daughter ma rried a 
New Yorker.  She is divorced.  She divorced him. 
 But they were very against him.  They feel 
that they are more.  They are.  They are more 
educated.  And one of them was going to school in 
England and her husband was an engineer.  And unf
ortunately they are different.  I didn™t come  
across a New Yorker black who was so nice as t
hose.  You know what I mean?   I™m not talking 
about Harlem.  I don™t know.  But what was ar
ound me , thatwas my opi
nion and that™s how I 
felt, that they were different.

Tape 6, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number six, si
de A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.  Whe n did you start 
speaking about your Holocaust experiences? 
 
A: In 1986, when I came here, and I went to the be
auty parlor and I had a short sleeve shirt on and 
the beautician said, ﬁWhat is that?ﬂ  I said, ﬁT
his is the Holocaust.ﬂ 
 ﬁThe Holocaust?  My 
daughter was just taught in Tates 
Creek High that she shouldn™t be
lieve it.  That they shouldn™t 
believe it, it was a Holocaust.  It
 was ma de up by the Jews.ﬂ  I thought I faint.  I says, ﬁWhat? ﬂ   
She says, ﬁYes, she was just taught.  And I very 
surprised to see you.  I never saw a survivor.ﬂ  
Then a woman came hereŠI came here the first time
 alone when we didn™t move in yet and they 
had blinds made in the fa mily roomŠand she was fr om McAlpins.  And I™m sitting in the chair 

and she sits near me , this way, and she noticed 
the number.  And she jumps up and she starts to 
scream.  I says, ﬁWhat happened? ﬂ  She says
, ﬁI never saw some body, I never saw nobody, who 
came back from there.  Let me  have a, let me , can I ma ke a prayer for you? ﬂ  And she kneels 

down and she starts to pray lik
e I would come , you know, fr om so
me where, an alien.  It was 
unbelievable experience.  But after that when it ha
ppened, that she said they were teaching it.  
She was teaching in Nicholasville, La ura, at that
 time.  And I told her, I says, ﬁWhere did you 
bring me?  That™s what they teach
 here?   I never heard it in my
 life.ﬂ  And she was very upset, 
and she spoke to the high school teacher there a
nd she said, ﬁHow about if she would come  to 
school? ﬂ   I says, ﬁI cannot talk. 
 I never spoke in my life.ﬂ  She 
says, ﬁHow about if I come  to 
your house?ﬂ  She said.  So she came , and I spoke
 to the mi crophone for two hours.  And from 
that mo me nt on, she [phone rings]  –She came fr
om the high school.  I spoke two hours in the 
mi crophone.  And it was no stop.  They came to the house and they were begging me  to come  to 

speak in the high school there.  A
nd it was a pretty bad experience,
 the very first one.  That was 
the first time when I spoke. 
 

Q: What was the high school where you spoke?   Whi c h one? 

 

A: I don™t know whether, yeah, they have more.  I s
poke at other high schools,
 too.  It was a regular 
high school, but I spoke at the hi
gh school there, when there we
re wome n who were pregnant 
and they were going to school.  Th
at was another high school, but th
at was  regular high school.  
I don™t know what was the name , in Nicholasville, Jessamine County.  And they were, it was a 

ma n teacher, who was very, very nice.  He was a hi
story teacher.  But it was a– they sat like 

around the wall in circle they put 
the chairs.  And on that side, on 
the left side, it was a circle 
with about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads 
and they didn™t look at 
me.  Because at that 
time I was beginner speaker and I started to 
speak and I asked them
 who believes in the 
Holocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they s
hould put their hands up.  They didn™t.  And the 
whole time I was talking and they didn™t look at
 me .  So whe n I finished, and I was pretty 
nervous, that was my first speech.  But it was good because the teacher was absolutely 

wonderful.  And he was embracing me  and ﬁThank G
od for you, that you are here,ﬂ and that kind 
of a thing.  And I says, ﬁAnd 
do you know whom you have here? ﬂ   He says, ﬁUnfortunately, 
yes.ﬂ  So, that was a bad experience for me , you know
, that there are skinheads there.  It was in 
Nicholasville.  But then I spoke ma ny, ma ny tim
es in Nicholasville mi ddle school, and when 
Laura was teaching, that was mi
ddle school.  And that high school.  I don™t know what was the 
name  of that high school.  They were all girls,
 wome n, I mean, and one of them ca me  to me .

They came after me and she said that, ﬁI thank you very much for comi ng because my father is 
German and he is telling an entirely different 
story and I knew that it™s some thing wrong how he 
is telling it to us.ﬂ  So I had that kind of an
 experiences.  Then it was non-stop, one school after 
the other.  Then it was in Paris, Kentucky.  In 
Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education.  
That was George™s departme nt, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two 

appointme nts.  A very nice, very nice professor. 
 And he had student teac
hers in Paris, Kentucky, 
and he took me  to Paris, Kentucky.  And some , th
ey took videos there that day, but it was a very 

big wind and the windows were open.  They didn™t 
have air conditioners.   
And the videos didn™t 
came out.  Well, so he took me  the second time a
nd he took with him a pr
ofessional videotaper 
from U.K.  And I didn™t know nothing, who else is
 there, but I saw that they are wome n there 
and they are taking pictures, too, fr
om me .  And they are writing.  
I had no idea that the paper is 
there.  He called The Herald.  And that was the 
first time  whe n I was in The Herald-Leader.  And 
when I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop.
  People were calling me .  Schools were calling 
me, and I can tell you that I spoke in every sc
hool in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160 
times already.  Because usually I, they put t
ogether six, se ven, eight gr ades usually in the 

auditorium.  And if the next bunch of kids come s,
 they call me back again.  And in every high 
school I spoke, too.  In every high school.  I spoke 
twice in Dunbar.  In– wh
at is that station?   
Bryan Station, Bryan Station, they we
re very nice there.  I spoke in Lafayette.  Now I have to go 
again.  Because I spoke when Ilona
 was there and still 
the teacher is there 
and now Anna has the 
teacher.  And she, he was asking whether your 
gr andmother still does it.  And Henry Clay, I 
spoke at Henry Clay.  Twice I s
poke already at the Community Coll
ege.  Three time s  at U.K.  I 
spoke in the nurse™s departme nt, Psychiatric Nu
rses™ departme nt.  And 
then the other was the 
Middle Eastern studies, bot
h of them twice.  And– 
 

Q: Have people been receptive mostly? 

 
A: Very nice.  Very, very nice.  Very nice.  
Very, very nice.  I cannot
 tell you, I have a whole 
drawer, from letters, what they
 are doing, Montessori school. 
 All the Montessori schools I 
spoke.  There are three of them here.  I spoke in
 Scapa, I don™t know how 
ma ny ti me s.  And what 
they do, the Scapa– oh, I spoke, lately I spoke in the Adult Educati
on at night.  That™s education 
at U.K.  I have a series for the concerts, five 
tickets for the U.K– not U.K., concerts what they 
are doing, gosh, five a year.  Five concerts, fr
om all over the world they are comi ng.  And the 
teacher, the professor that sits in front of me, sh
e is a woma n, but is Geor ge™s colleague actually.  
So, she never– I don™t know, she was always afraid 
to ask me and we always talk to her.  And a 
few weeks ago, it was a concert and she turns ar
ound and she says, ﬁAre 
you alright? ﬂ   And I 
says, ﬁYes, why? ﬂ  I wasn™t all 
right the week before and George was there with Ana.  And she 
says, ﬁOh, can I ask you to talk? ﬂ   
I says, ﬁOf course.ﬂ  And one of
 her students, they are all for 
Masters, teachers who are going for Masters.  And 
one of her students is from Scapa.  And she™s 
her best friend.  And that woma n, she is a pastor™s
 wife from the Lutheran church, Mrs. Gross.  

Wonderful, wonderful person.  I 
don™t know how ma ny times  I spoke.  And what she is doing, 
she binds the books what the children are writing.  The letters, and it™s unbelievable what they 

are doing.  And flowers they are 
giving me .  And that professor,
 Dr. Backner, I don™t know how 
ma ny ti me s he took me .  He was, unfortunately he
 didn™t get tenure at U.K. because he wasn™t 
writing.  But he said he didn™t want the tenure. 
 He was there six years.  And then he was 
principal in Georgetown.  And he called me  there,
 too.  I spoke in Georgetown for hi m, and he 
picks me  up, and he takes me  home , and in-between
 he takes me  to a restaurant when he takes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
70
 
 
me  home, to the nicest restaura
nts to eat.  And it was an openi
ng here in Lexington, what™s it, 
Lexington Tr aditional.  It™s on Nicholasville Roa
d.  And I asked him when he was in– because I 
spoke there two or three time s and I knew it was an
 opening there for principal.  And I ask him in 
Georgetown whether he wants to come  to Lexi
ngton.  He lives here.  And he says, ﬁWhy? ﬂ  I 
says, ﬁBecause I know it™s, I don™t 
know the principal who is there,
 just in between.ﬂ  He lives, 
she was, he was Laura™s principa
l in Jesse Clar k.  He lives in 
our corner.  And I said, ﬁIs Mr. 
Mossgrave there? ﬂ  And he says, ﬁOh, not a bad 
idea.ﬂ  And then I spoke to Mossgrave.  I says, 
ﬁ Would you please call him because you are here onl
y for a few months.ﬂ  [Laughing]  Because 
he is retired, and he works a few mo nths only be
cause of the Social Secu
rity probably.  And he 
got the job.  He got the job.  So I already spoke 
twice to him here, in _______.  And last time  his 
wife picked me  up, and we me
t in the restaurant, Chaise 
(ph )
.  And he came there from school 
and his daughter came , too.  It™s very interesting. 
 His daughter was for a whole year in Belarus.  
Very interesting.  She said, she loves the people th
ere and she wants to learn the language.  Very 
nice person.  And both of them ca
me  to listen to me , too.  The 
wife and the daughter, last time 
that I spoke.  It was the end of the year. 
 
Q: When you started speaking about your experien
ces, did you find that me mories were comi ng up 
that you hadn™t thought of? 
 

A: Everything is comi ng up.  I 
don™t– if they give me enough t i me, I a m telling them from 
beginning to the end, everything.  
Memories are always with me , 
not coming up, they are always 
with me .  And I don™t try to forget it.  Sylvia trie
s to forget it.  That™s the difference between me  
and Sylvia.  And it™s a big difference, because 
she ma rried an American man and she ne ver had 

to talk about it.  So it™s a big difference.  But 
she doesn™t want to talk about it with me  either.  
And she was in the sa me  place.  She was in Berg
en-Belsen.  And she doesn™t want, she says what 
she has left over, life, she wants to ma ke it happy. 
 I cannot forget it.  I can
not erase it that they 
killed my pa rents.  I can™t.  And the si x m
illion people and everybody and big, big family from 
my grandmother™s side.  I can™t.  I can™t forg
et it, no one day.  And I am dr eaming about it, 

especially when I™m talking, I™m dreaming.  I said
 once to my heart doctor
, I says, ﬁI just don™t 
know, I cannot sleep.  Maybe I shoul
dn™t talk anymore.ﬂ  He said, ﬁY
ou just take your pill and 
talk.ﬂ  [Laughing]  That™s what he said.  They
 are so funny the doctors.  They have my  pictures, 
when I am i n the newspaper, they 
put it in they files.  So, when th
ey bring the files, here you are.  
It™s interesting.  Yeah, lot of them. 
 

Q: You talked earlier, I guess it was the last ti
me , about how you had such guilt feelings after your 
parents and your sist er were ki
lled.  And I wondered if you ever
 got over guilt fe
elings?  If you 
ever got over that? 
 

A: I, look, I have a guilt feeling always about my sister, yes.  How is it that
 she said– it™s fate.  I 
don™t know.  I have to come– I have to forget that
 guilt feeling, because I wa
sn™t there.  I wasn™t 
there.  And I am sure that if I would be there, I would do the same  thing.  Because she had an 

opportunity to escape and she says
, ﬁI go where my mother goes.ﬂ  And if I would be there, I 
would do the same  thing.  I wasn™t there.  It
 was a coincidence.  I had problem with my  
rheuma tic fever that year and I had to go– my mo
ther send me first.  Every summer we spent 
there in Budapest at my grandmother™s house.  
And I took every year a cure for my r heuma tic 
fever.  Whe n it was nothing wrong with me .  Th
e doctor said we should do it that it shouldn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
71
 
 
come  back.  And I had a doctor there, in one of th
ose baths that they have.  It™s wonderful waters 
they have.  And he gave me  a cure for three weeks.
  And it wasn™t my fault 
that I wasn™t there.  I 
was thinking about it many times.  That I shouldma ke, I shouldn™t be  so guilty be cause it wasn™t 
my fault.  First time  in my life, I was 21, and fi
rst time in my life I was traveling alone.  It was 
400 miles on the train to my gra
ndmother.  Because I finished sc
hool and my sister wa s still in 
school, otherwise we would go together.  The year 
before, Christma s, we went together with my 
sister.  So it wasn™t my fault.  
It was fate.  It was fate.  And wh
en I was telling it in some  schools 
and I says– children were asking me , how come  
that you survive?   I says, ﬁThat™s the only 
question I cannot answer you.ﬂ  And the principal,
 not principal, the S
uperintendent, I didn™t 
know that he was there.  He said– he was sitting in
 the corner.  ﬁI tell you why,ﬂ he said.  ﬁThat 
she should spread it to the peopl
e.ﬂ  I says, ﬁThank you very much
 for helping me  out, but I think 
my sister could have spread 
it, too.  So, it is nice that 
you think about it this way.ﬂ 
 

Q: Do you feel safe and at home  
in this country, and in Lexington? 

 

A: I™m every year alone in this house, now I don™t go
 with them in the countr
y.  And this year I am 
thinking about it.  That they rea
lly shouldn™t do it, that 
they leave me  alone here.  I went with 
them every year, but I don™t know how ma ny ye
ars now, about four years, I don™t go because 
Laura wants to be alone with George.  And he sa
ys we are here together the whole year, we are 
together.  Though it™s my house, I cannot go there.  
So, I went there three years ago.  She went to 
Hungary with Ana, because she was never in Hu
ngary, Ana.  She was never in Hungary.  Ilona 
was with me .  I took Ilona.  ™89, after her, that 
was my Bat Mitzvah present to her in ‚89.  I took 
her to Hungary for three weeks and one week in Vi
enna we were.  And so, she went with Ana.  I 
gave Ana her Bat Mitzvah present, 
the ticket, to go to Hungary.  So Laura had a free ticket that 
she™s collecting, you know, the free fli
ghts.  So they went to Hungar
y.  And then I went for three 
weeks to the country and stayed with George.  
I had a great time.  I had a great time.  What 
should I tell you.  So, that™s the situation.  I w
on™t go there now, sick as I am.  See we have 

always only one car there, and 
I am depending on them.  And it™
s not comfortabl
e anymore.  I 
took now, when the children are there, upstair
s the bedroom, because it™s a– they made a 
window, you know, the skylight there.  And they ha
ve air conditioner up there.  I cannot go steps 
up again, and up and down.  And they ma de a half ba
throom there, I ma de.  I had to pay half for 

it, the time that I am up there.  And that™s only half
 bathroom.  If I want to take a bath, I have to 
go downstairs.  It™s no more comfortable for 
me .  It came to a point that it™s no more 
comfortable. 
 

Q: I just was wondering if you felt that Ameri
ca had become  home  to you a nd that you, also 
whether you felt like– 
 

A: It was my h o me.  New York was my ho me .  It
 was my home.  I never, when I went even to 
Hungary, I never said I™m going home.  That I can 
erase because of what they did to us.  You 
know?   I was born there.  And all the relatives ther
e.  But I never, never said ﬁI am going home .  

I am going to Hungary.ﬂ  New York 
was my home. I felt at home .   
 

Q: Do you think that people in this country and 
in this day and age are,
 are paying attention enough 
to the dangers of what happened during the Holo
caust and ma king sure th
at it couldn™t happen 
again? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
72
 
 
 
A: No, no.  The people are so far away from it.  Ev
en then, when it happened, I think, they were so 
far away from it, that it™s only me  that I am afraid that it can happen and what can happen.  It™s 

only me  who went through.  They are laughing wh
en I am s a ying it, that I am afraid from 
everything.  I am afraid of my shadow, you know, 
that kind of a situation.  But no.  When we 
went to Hungary and they were asking us, ﬁHow 
could you live there?   This is a jungle there, in 
New York.ﬂ  You know?   They have a very bad opi
nion of what™s happening in New York.  It™s 
happening here, too.  This is much smaller 
and what™s happening here, when you open the 
televi sion, they start the killing.  Okay, it™s a fam
ily killing or whatever but it™s happening.  It™s 
happening here, too.  And it™s always worse for th
e people who don™t live in
 a place.  You know, 
it seems mu ch worse.  I don™t know.  I wasn™t a
fraid in New York where I lived.  Once I was 
very afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it 
to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have 
to give back Hong Kong, and they were comi ng.  
And he said that he wants it for his family.  
Baloney.  He ma de a business from it.  He ma de
 from a two-family house, four fa milies.  For 

money, he™s getting rent.  Unbelievable.  From 
the baseme nt he ma de two apartments and two 
apartments what we had upstairs.  I went to see 
it when– there™s no garage.  From the garage he 

ma de an apartment.  It™s unbelievable.  And he want
ed to get out from it, the last mi nute.  But he 
had 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down?  How much
?   I don™t know how ma ny thousands he had to 
put down when we ma de the agreement.  It wa
s in the lawyers, collateral, you know.  And he 
wanted to, if he doesn™t get the mortgage what he
 wants, that he can get out from it, but he got 
the mortgage what he wanted.  The lawyer find out
 he got the mortgage what he wanted.  But he 
wanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to ge
t out.  But then he would lose that money.  I 
think it was 25.  I don™t reme mber.  Anyway.  A
nd I was getting phone calls and it wa s a strange, 
strange accent, that I am going to come  and kill you.  So then I said, ﬁMy God, I want to get out 

as early as can from here.ﬂ  You know?   I thi
nk they were those people,
 those Chinese, I don™t 
know.  Then I was very afraid.  Though in the begi
nning I was very afraid, 
we were robbed.  So I 
slept, not in our house, we lived
 in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment, 
we were robbed.  But that™s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood.  But 

otherwise, otherwise I didn™t have
 that fear.  I didn™t go on the 
subways, I was driving.  And it 
was very dangerous already, in th
e hospital, too.  So it was a park
ing lot across the street where I 
paid parking.  And I just ran to
 the building.  It was very danger
ous.  I got out at the last mi nute 
really, because if you walked in the hospital it
self, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or 
some thing, people from outside came and they took 
it off.  So it was a very dangerous place.  
And it is very interesting that every hospital in 
New York, it is in a bad place now.  It is very 
interesting.  Even Flowers 
(ph )
,  Fift h Avenue, my God, my
 husband was operated, spine 
operation and I went to visit him with George.  
Behind it there were big buildings and we  had to 
get off the subway.  And they were throwing bottles
 against us.  That was the best hospital, the 
name  Flowe r , Fifth Avenue.  Can you imagine?   Th
at was years ago.  Stay in Harlem, or no.  So, 
we came here.  What I was seeing today on the tele
vision show, it™s really scary, about five black 
guys, who are thieves.  And that show is from
 New York, and how they are stealing cars and 
how they are just bumping into people™s cars.  And then innocent wome n, they get out, what 

happened.  And they get out too, behind them and they
 grab their necks, put 
them in the other car 
behind them and they take that car because it™s a be
tter car than theirs.  There were five of them.  

Can you ima gine that?   I don™t know how they can 
say it on the television this way.  And there 
was a detective there, too.  And they were saying it, how they are show 
it how they are doing it 

and they are selling it.  And she said, ﬁHow mu ch
 you get for that car?ﬂ  She says, ﬁWe sell it for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.478*0005
  
 
73
 
 
parts, 500 dollars.  And if it™s a Mercedes, a ni
ce, new one, some times 5,000 dollars.ﬂ  This is, 
this is, now again a more dangerous life since I ca
me .  They were stealing cars, of course they 
were stealing cars, but that way I 
didn™t hear it, never, when I wa
s living there.  So it™s now 13 
years.   
 
Q: What about anti-Semitism?    

 

A: In New York? 

 

Q: Living in Lexington, have  you experienced anti-Semitism?  

 

A: Actually no, because I am not– I think in this neighborhood, yes.  I didn™t experience it, but I 
have a friend, who is ma rried to a Chinese ma
n.  She™s from Canada.  And she, nobody was her 
friend, only I.  [Laughing.]  But she lives herea long, long time , and her mother was Russian.  

And she was born in Canada.  And she™s telli
ng me that this neighborhood, when she– they 
builded the house.  They didn™t allow Jews in th
is neighborhood.  That was what she was telling 
me .  And then I had a rema rk.  Some body came,
 I don™t know who was it, those guys who are, 
you know, trying to convert you.  I don™t know whic
h religion was it.  And I said, ﬁI am not 
interested.  I am Jewish.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁWhat is
 it, everybody is Jewish 
in this neighborhood? ﬂ   
I says, ﬁNo, mi nority.ﬂ  They are all Baptist he
re, in this neighborhood.  But now there are a few 
Jewish families.  But she said that they were
n™t allowed here in this neighborhood, Jews.  I 
didn™t, as I said, I don™t know.  I didn™t know ab
out it.  And she, she was unbelievable, they 
didn™t want  to take her nowhere between them, b
ecause she was ma rrying to a Chinese.  He is a 
genius.  He is now 70, I don™t know, some thing.  He got tenure.  He was with IBM originally.  

And then he was teaching at UK.  And now he is
 teaching in Frankfort in
 state university.  And 
at age 70 they gave him tenure.  He is such a 
genius.  But he is Chinese.  And she has two 
Chinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and 
a son, both of them are doctors.  And they were 
really suffering in this ne ighborhood, she said, becau
se they were Chinese kids.  She was always 
telling me  what they went through.  So, it™s any differe
nce, Chinese or Jew?   If they don™t, if it™s 
not their own, then they don™t like you.  I don™t k
now.  We  are friends.  With this building now.  
Those people lived before them a very long time here, 20 years.  He was a pathologist and she 

was Head of Pathology at UK.  And we didn™t go
 to each ot her™s houses, but when we spoke we 
were very nice.  And her daughter, Jenna™s daughte
r, when she got ma rried in Louisville all the 

neighbors got together, five of us and we we
nt all to the wedding, to
 her daughter™s wedding, 
because she didn™t have any family here.  She do
esn™t have  any family here.  And because I am 
Jewish and she is ma rried to a Chinese [laughi
ng] so we are very good friends.  We  are going 
together, she helps me  enormously.  She is a 
very good person.  Now she was, she was nurse, 
actually.  She went for nursing in Case We stern, in
 Cleveland.  She me t him there somewhere, I 
don™t know, in Ohio.  She– really, she felt it at 
UK.  She wa s in the Nursing department and she 
was the head of the private nurses at that time th
ey had.  And she had to give the patients the 
nurses.  And she is absolutely, you know, she 
didn™t know about discrimi nation.  And she gave 
once a black nurse to a white person.  She was fi
red.  And then when she was fired from there 
she started to tutor.  She is very good in ma
th.  And she tutored all the kids from this 
neighborhood.  She knows everybody because she was a 
tutor.  And from that, because it was not 

enough what her husband ma de, they send the two 
children to me dical school
.  The daughter is a 
psychiatrist and she is having now the first baby
, she is waiting every mi nute, though she is 35

74
 
 
years old.  Yeah, she is.  And she lives in Louisville
.  And the son is in Loui
sville, too.  He is a 
general practitioner,
 but he wanted to
 be a surgeon.

Tape 6, Side B 
 
 
A: –here that I am accepted.  I think because of
 the speeches, that™s why.  Many people know me , 
and ma ny people want me, and many people are ve ry grateful th
at I am teaching and I am 
teaching the children about histor y, what is not, 
unfortunately, not in histor y books.  It™s only a 
few words about the Second World War, the Holo
caust.  And I don™t know whether it ever will 
be.  And they are very grateful and gracious.  An
d really they do everything for me .  They pick 
me up, they take me home, they take me to eat. 
 They give me presents.  It™s unbelievable what 
they are doing, those people.  A
nd I think that it™s sincere.
  Those people who, you know, who 
are calling me  and I a m talking– so it™s ma ny peopl
e.  150 times I talk, it™s ma ny people.  They 
are sincere.  And they are not anti-Semitic.  
They are not.  I™m convinced 100 percent about 
ma ny, many of them, the y are not.   
 

Q: Anything else you™d like to
 say before we close?   
 

A: Before we close?   You are a nice person.  [Laughing.]  I like you.

A: Thank you.  [Laughter.] 

 

Q: I thank you very much for spe
nding all of this time with me. 
 

A: You are very welcome.
