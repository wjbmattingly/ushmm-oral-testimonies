>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e " Your lif e was beautif ul"  in theearly years 
b ef o r e

>> Halina Peabody:  Iwas very young, not quite 7 when the war broke out.  
My m em ory is rather childhood. I was thef irst child of m y parents.  I was the 
princess, so to speak. I had every bicyc le and tricycle, andm y m other was 
ve r y a l l
-
around sportswom an.  I was skating f reely at 5. I rem em ber that.  
She was always teaching the girls there,the little children there to swim . W e 

hada nice house.  My father was a dentist.  He had his surgery in thef ront of 
the house, and m y m other tended to m e and the little garden.  
 
 
W ehad beautiful weather there.  Zaleszczyki  is in the easternm ost 
part of Poland.  Not anym ore, but it usedtobe, and the river Dniester which 

is near Rom ania.  Youcould go ina kayak,half way through, but there were 
buoys there, and you couldn't go anyf urther. But you could geta day pass to 
Rom ania and goover.  It was ver y close, the relations were good.  It was a 
ver y f riendly f rontier.  
 
 
I had no worries.  My f ather insistedonteaching m e to read bef ore I 
was going to school, because I was supposed tobea genius.  
 
[Laughter]
 
But it stoodm e in good stead later on.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  Besides teaching you to read at5, your parents taught you 
m any other skills.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m other was a wonderf ul knitter. She taught m e to 

knit, crochet,embroider.  She used to knitform y Shirley T empledoll.

>> Bill Benson: T ell us a
 
bitm ore about your m other's athleticexperience. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,m y m other was a natural. W hen she started 
swim m ing, she imm ediately passed everybody else, even though she wasn't 
even swim m ing well.  She very quickl y becam epartof  the team .
  
Very early 
on, in herearly teenage years she won the Polish cham pionship.  She broke 

records.  Sheused toshow m e the statuetteof  gold she hadfor the 
championship, the f our
-
leaf clover that we had, all gone, but she was 
wonderful. W hen she left Zaleszczyki, even though we were f rom  Krakow, 

because there was water there, she could water ski there, and we'dgo on the 
kayak.  I hada littlepaddle, justfor me.  A wonderf ul, wonderf ul lif eup to that 
point, up to 1939.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, it all would change then. Septem ber1939 
Germ any invaded Poland from  the west. TheSoviets then invaded Poland 
f rom  theeast.  You lived in thepart of Polandthatfell under the Russian 
occupation.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. W hat happened was, we knew the Russians were 

c o m i n g.  W hat  I
 
--
 
I don't remem berexactly what I knew, but the people were 
ver y great panic, they were running around. A lot ofm en decidedthey didn't 

want to be conscripted.  T hat's what the Russians did, they used to conscript 
the m en i
nto the Russian arm y, and you were 20 years in this kind of prison.  
You couldn't leave.

So a lot ofm en
 
--
 
alsothey thought about W orldW ar I where they did 
thatto them en. They didn't thinkof  wom en and children being in any 
danger.  I didn'tm ention that m y sister was born two m onthsbefore the war.  
So there was ababy in the house. 
 
 
My f atherdecidedhe should runover to Romania with som eothers, 
andthey just went over the bridgeto Rom ania.  A lotof  people with him  did.  
 
 
Un fo rtu na te ly, th
en,the Russians cam e in, and they did a lot of bad 
things, as I understand it. T he people, however, that went over decided af ter 
a while thatthings have settleddown, and perhaps it wouldbe OK to com e 
back to thefam iliesand the businesses that they l
e ft.  
 
 
So they decided to quietly cross back over. By then,the river was 
com pletely f rozen over. Took a white sheet, they tried to cross quietly back.  
Unfortunately, the Russians by then sealedthe border. T hey were all 
arrested.  
 
 
T hey were tried for being spies, because they went over and came 
back.  Myf ather ended up in aprison, then was sent to Siberia, to aplace
 
--
 
we as thefam ily of  a crim inal, quoteunquote,were supposed to go to 

Russia.  AsI said, the crim inals andfam ilieswere also sentto Siberia.  For 
som e reason,that I still don't know what it was, they didn't take us. W e were 
all ready to go.  However, they threw us outof our house, because we were 
notallowed to have ahouse.

I know we m oved toa little place called time

called 
T ousteupthe road. W e had to leave. W ehad a little room , I remember.  
T hat picture is theonly pictureof m y sister as a little child, thatm y mother 
was there. T hat was in the winter. T hat's where we were, until very shortly 
af terwards, the Germ ans decidedthat
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Letme ask youa couple questionsbefore we go there.  

W hen yourf ather was then sent to Siberia, arrestedand sent to Siberia, did 
your m other know what had happened to him?  Did she hearf rom him  
in any 
wa y ?   
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e didn'thearf or quite a while.  He was com pletely 
incomm unicadof orawhile.  T hen we got a letter that he was in the gulag 
there. Before theGerm ans took over, we had afew letters back andf orth.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Once the Germ ans took over, that was theend of that?  
 
>> Halina Peabody: The comm unication was over.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereany other relatives sent toSiberia?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, m y aunt,uncle and cousin. T he other aunt and 

uncle, who were supposed to be takenas well, theyf or some reasonleft and 
they endedup in Auschwitz.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyweren't taken by the Russians?  
 
>> Halina Peabody: They were not, later on.

>> Bill Benson:  You were about 8
 
1/2 when the Nazis turned on the
 
Russians, andthe Germ ans cam e intothearea of Poland where you were.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  And we came back to our house then.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, then things turneddramatically worse.  Tell us 

what happened.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, when theGermans cam e, we cam e back to our 
house, when the Germans occupied the restof  Poland they put all kinds of 
rules.  Everybody was very anxious to cooperate.W e were ver y, ve ry 
terrif ied. T his was another occupation, not knowing what they expected f ro
m 
us.  As the Russians did, they demanded gold, silver, anything of  value we 

hadto give in.  
 
 
T hey hadeverybody working f orthem . Every Jewish personhad tobe 
workin g f or them , to the point where if  therewas no particular jobfor them, 
they m ade them
 
clean the roads.  
 
 
A lot of tim es they would take groups of young peopleto work in the 
f ield.  T hey would just ask f or the num ber of  so
-
and
-
so, they would take them  
and come back.  
 
 
T hey created
 
--
 
excuse m e. T hey created Judenrat. Judenrat was a 
Je w
ish com m ittee. T hey took the leadersof  the Jewish com munity of  the 
town andthey worked through them . So if they had demandsf or whatever 
they had dem ands, they would ask through the com m ittee, and the 

10
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
 
comm ittee was toldtosupply whatever was necessary
.  
 
 
As I said, we went back to our house, som y m other tried to lookaf ter 
m y sister as best she could,and me. Keptmy wr iting up. T hen they knew 
she was a good knitter, so they had her knitfor themayor of town. Of 
course,a Germ anm an who had lots of children.  Her job was to knitfor the 
m ayor's children.  
 
 
Ever ybody, as I said,was ver y cooperative. T hey, of  course,put 
ye llo w
 
stars on the houses, yellow bands on our hands.  No schoolfor 
Jewish children.   As I said, we just sat thereandtried
 
to do whatever we 
could. Very, ver y scared, not knowing, not knowing what. T here was 

nowhere to run.W e just waited to see whatwould happennext. W e hoped 
just by cooperating things wouldn't betoo bad.  Everybody was wi lli ng to do 
what was necessary
.  
 
 
W e waitedalways f or the people, went to work, came back. Then the 
SS cam e in, all in black uniform s and goldbuttons, very, ver y scar y, came 
roaring down the roadon bicycles
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Motorcycles?  
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Motorcycles, yes. 
 
Great noise. W e just stayed quiet, 
didn't know what elsewas com ing.  
 
 
W hat they did was instill a lot off ear in us. W e were absolutely 
terrif ied. T hey start doing things like catching Jewish peoplethat had beards, 

11
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
 
andthat was their religions part 
of  their
 
--
 
religious part, the religious people 
had lots of beards.T hey would catch aperson in the street.T herewere lots 
of  scream s, yells. T hey would tear off their hair anddothings like that.  I 
rem em ber one tim e I was standing inf rontof m y house, andm y m other 
pulledm e away.  T hose are the kindof  images that I rem em bered.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You shared with me an incident that took place pretty quickl y 

where a large group of young m en and wom en were roundedup.Tell us 
about that.  
 
>> H a l i
na Peabody:  Yeah. W ell, at thispoint they had thisdem andfor a big 
group of  young people.  They said they wanted asm any as they could to 
com e tothe square where they would gather,andthey would walk up the 
road. There was an old Polishm ilitary cam p.  The winters were ver y, ver y 
f ierce there. Very, ver y severe.  Som etimesfor the winter they woul d wrap 
up the trunks of the trees with burlap.T hat'swhat they said thatthey needed 
to have done, because they were up there inthem ilitary cam pand there was 
nobody there, but they neededto wrap thosetrees.  
 
 
So a lot of people came, over the number apparently even requested.  
Ever ybody wantedtohelp.  A lotof  volunteers. T hey all cam e.  
 
 
T hey were m archedup the road, and we waitedfor them to c
ome 
back inthe evening.  And nobody was com ing back. So people were getting 
a little nervous. W aited and waited. Fam ily m em bers, nothing.

Eventually, towards the evening, onem an dragged him self in and 
back to hisfam ily, and he told us what happened. W hat he said was that 
when they got there, there was a grave, a com munal grave.  T herewere 
planksof  wood over the grave, and they were told to takeoff  the clothes and 
lay down on the planks, and they were shot. As they were shot, they 
dropped into the grave.  
 
 
He was the last one tobe done.  He was oneof  the last group that 
was shot, andhe 
--
 
apparently they m issed his heart, they just hit his arm , 
andthey didn't cover them very m uch with the earth, because there was no 

n e ed  to.  A  little  b ito
ver the top.  Hem anaged to drag him self out, and he 
cam e hom e, and that's what he reported.  
 
 
W ethen understood what happened.  Over 800 people. As I 
m entioned to Bill, we alwa ys were aware of  this horrif icm em ory, that I 

thought there was nota sign of butthis grave. W e were back in Zaleszc zyki, 
andthey didn't know about it even. 
 
 
T hrough them useum s, I tracked down af ew peoplef rom  this 
hometown of m ine. As I said, I didn't rem ember any nam es, but I saw t wo 
sist e rs f ro m  Za le szczyki,  a n d I m a na g
ed to track them down.  There was 
qu i t e
 
--
 
it was aboutf ive, six of usapparently in New
 
York, in Montreal.  
 
 
W egottogether. W egot a monument. T hislady who li ves in 
Montreal went back there and she arrangedwith the town toput the

m o num e nt  o n i t .  
 
W e traveled April 2011 and put a monument. W e had a 
cantor there, and we prayed, prayedf or them. T hat was oneof m y goals that 
I wanted to put some kind of am em ory m ark there. Sothat was thef irst time 
we heard about this, what happenedtopeople when they took them away.  
 
 
T hen we settledback,we wanted to know what the next thing is going 
to be, thenext shoe todrop.  Not very soon afterwards, they again 
--
 
t h is  t ime  
thedem and wasf or anumberof  people. They had exactnum bers.  Because 

they were going to take them  for work in Germ any.  
 
 
Of course, by then,everybody was running and trying to hide.  My 
m other tookm y sister and m e over, I know, to a lady thatused to cookfor us, 
across the street,andwe were going to stay with her for the day.  And we 
waited thereall day.  
 
 
T hey hadaneasy job,because allof  thehouses were m arked with 
yello w stars, they knew where tof ind them . T hey got the right number. They 
loaded them  on the train, supposedly for work  in Germ any.  Never heard 
f r om  t
hem  again, either.  
 
 
As we went back, we realized that it was really a situation that was 
horrendous. My m other with the two children, nowhere to run.  
 
 
W e wanted to know what is going to benext. W hat they didnext, they 
didn't want to have the trouble to lookfor people and to drag them  out of the 
houses, because after they had those two actions, there were not that many 

14

Jews lef t. Sothey threw us out of the town altogether to the sam e place that 
we were during the Russians,T ouste. T hey also brought peoplef rom  the 
comm unities around that did the sam ething. W hatever was lef t, they put us 
together again into T ouste.  
 
 
T here,everybody f irst, what they wanted to do was lookf orhiding 
places,because we knew the next step would be,again, they were going to 

try to  ge t u s o ut.  
 
 
So I know m y m other said to me there's notmuch point in doing that, 
because as soon as they get us intoa sm aller group, they'll m ove us again.  
So we wil l lose. T his is a no
-
win situation.  
 
 
She was trying desperately to have at least the children taken over to 
Rom ania,all sorts of things, butnothing work ed.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  She put in m otiona plan at one point
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Not at thispoint.  She tried to get us over
 
--
  
>>
 
Bill Benson: T hat's what I mean.  Apartf rom her? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right, withouther.  Yes.  Ididn't wanttogo.  
Anyway, at this point the m an cam eagainf or a groupof  people to be in the 
square to gofor work in Germ any, and at this point you see m y m other, 
because she had some connections there, she knew two f armers. She 
decided to hide with the farm ers.  
 
 
A lot of people went underneaththe houses. A lot of people had little 

15
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

hiding places marked for them .  So everybody went into hidi
n g.   
 
 
I was placed with afarm er up inthe lof t.  I was lef t there. My m other 
m ade a deal with anotherfarm er andtookmy sister.  She was going to stay 
with thatf arm erfor the day.  As theday went on, the lady that hadme kept 
com ing back and telling m e thatthis one was seen in the square, that one 
was seen in the square.  I was convinced m y m other was caught.  All day 
long I thoughtm y God, m y m other was caught.  
 
 
T oward the endof  theday f inally, she cam ewith m y sister and toldm e 
what happened with her, which was that her farm er was scared.  Inthe 
m iddle of the day shegot scared,because itwas a high penalty f orkeeping 
Jewish people.  And she threw her out.  Shejust threw her out with m y sister 
i n t o  an  em pt y f i e l d.   
 
 
Now, that em pty f ield w
as f lat,and it had just a littlebush there, she 
toldm e. She was hiding underthis littlebush with m y sister.  Shewas 
crouching theref orthe rest of the day.  She said how they didn't see her is a 
m iracle,because they were circl ing with airplanes, lookingf or stragglers.  
Somehow, by m iracle, they didn't seeher. 
 
 
She was always worr ied about me.  Now, she was worried also that I 
was caught.  So we we re both ina stateof  greatanxiety.  
 
 
W hen we came together, she said shem adeup her m ind that w
e 
were not going to separate again. W hatever happenstous, we'll go 

16

together.T hat's the way it was goin g to be,whatever happens we'll be 
together, we're not going to be apart.  
 
 
She was worried m ainly for the children. I knew she didn't careabout 
h
erself ,because she knew what was happening in the concentration camps, 
thatthe children didn't survi ve at all.  
 
 
So she, with the help of herf riend, started thinking again of f indinga 
wa y. W hat they cam eup with, because we were three girls, shem anaged to 

obtainf alse identities of  Catholics. W e were going to just leave there, 
escapef rom  there intoa town where nobodyknew us.  
 
 
T hat's what thef riends helped her, we m anaged to get onto a train in 
Jaroslav 
--
 
I'm  sorry, in Touste.  This was going to be atrip toa place called 
Jaroslav.  I had no idea why that town, but itwas on the way to Krakow.  T he 

town was already withoutany Jews there. W e justhopednobody would 
recognize us, you know.  I was blonde, real blonde, and I had green eyes, so 
I  
didn't look Jewish.  
 
 
W edidn't speak Yiddish.  Our accents were very Polish.  My m other 
thought we hadm aybe a chance.  
 
 
So we said good

collected littlem oney for her. W ehad two suitcases left of all, everything that 
we ever had. T hat's how we startedour trip to Jaroslav.  
 
 
As we were travelin g, a young m an attachedhim self tous, started 
chatting us up, talking about the childrenandm y m other. Slowl y, slowly he 
startedpushing, asking if there was anybody Jewish in thefam ily, m aybe t
he 
father, grandfather.  Itwas enough if  it was great

great grandfather was 
Jewish, you were still Jewish.  Didn't havem uch chance.  
 
 
Slowl y, slo wl y he wore m y m other down, andyou can imagine a 
m other with two kids, terrified, not knowing where we're going, what to do.  
 
 
She said tom ef inally, you know, I couldnot resist anym ore.  I couldn't 
withstand the pressure, and I toldhim , yes, indeed, we are Jewish. At which 
point, he said, well, you know, I have to takeyou to the gestapo.  And I'm 
g
oing to Jaroslav as well, so I will look af ter you.  
 
 
He did,he looked after us very caref ully.  Hewas ver y sure tohave 
even m y sister orm e in his sights. But we had nowhere to run. W e weren't 
going to run anywa y.  
 
 
As we were travelin g, then m y m other started again thinking of  
som ething. She didn't know what, but she wanted todo something. She 

knew we didn't have any way to escape.  
 
 
T hem ainthing with her was not tobe separatedf rom  the children.  
Shedid not want the children to be takenaw

So she started speaking with him ,and she said, "Look, I will gi ve you 
the receiptsfor m y two suitcases and all them oney I have."  Evenshe 
prom ised the coats we had on ourbacks. She said" I just want youto do one 
thing f or m e. W hen w
e get to the gestapo, could you have us shot 
im mediately, all threeof us, because Idon'twant to be separatedf rom my 

children, I don't want the children to suffer."  
 
 
He prom isedhe would.  So that's how we traveled,fourdays,f our 
nights. W e were absolutely exhausted as you can im agine.W hilst we were 
traveling, I wasn't thinking hard, but we neared Jaroslav and I started 
worr ying a little bit.  I was af raid of dying, as anybody would, even asm all 
child would.  
 
 
My sister was com pletely unaware of
 
all this. She was very young, 
like 2 years old,2
 
1/2.W edidn't tell her anything.  For me, it started being a 
big deal. I got scared and didn't want todie. 
 

 
As we got off  the train,we started walking towards gestapo,and I 
started pulling at m y m
other saying " Mom ,mom , I don't wanttodie."   My 
poorm om  looked athim  and said" Look, why don't you lether go? She's 
blonde and she couldprobably get awa y with it, maybe she will sur vive."   
 
 
I said" No, I don't want to go by m yself.  I want you and 
m y sist e r t o 
com e too" obviously.  
 

 
So as we're walking, she says tohim , " Do you have children of your

own?"
 
He said" Yes."   
 
 
She said" Look, I've given you ever ything I have. W hy do you want us 
on your conscience?  Just letus go andtry our luck."   
 
 
And something touched him, andhe thoughtabout it,and he said 
" You don'thave a chance," he said, but he lef t us. 
 
 
So he lef t us in them iddle of the town, strange town, didn't know, the 
m ain road, lef t us. There we were. W e had nothing.  He took everyt hing with 
him ,of  course.W e were just threeof  us.

Bill Benson: T ell us, Halina,before you tell us how you started your new 
lif e in Jaroslav, you are just 8
 
1/2, 9 years old, and you arenow having to be

you recall of  thediff iculty of  that, of being so prepared that you wouldn't get

questions tof igure out who you really are?  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, Ididn't know m uch, but I was a kid.  I knew I had 
to  c

>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, yes. T hat was thef irst thing, m y mother sat me 
down, gave m e allof  the new details. A new nam e,new birth date,new 
grandparents, different area,everything, yes.  I knew, I was aware. Fear will 
keep you straight.  I was pretty well
-
trained by m y m other anywa y.  
 
 
I had all of the details, andthe trouble was wit h the papers that we 
never knew whether they were good or not.My m other was always  worried 
about that. T othis day, I don't know, because I gave them  to the Holocaust 
Museum .  I don't know if the papers were real or not. T hey were sold tous 
by a priest, that'sall I know.  T here were stamps. T hosedays therewere no 
com puters. T hank goodnessnow.  It was better nottobe checked. T hat 
was one of m y mother's problem s,because when we were lef t inthe town, 
she neededtof inda place to stay so we wouldn't be on the street, because 
the Germans were just walking around with the gun at the side, it was ver y 
easy.  Lif e was very ch eap.  
 
 
W e walked into a little cafe wherem y m otherstartedasking if  they 
knew of som ebody who could take lodgers in.  A youngm an got up, said he 
knew of a washer lady.  He said he would wal k us to her, which he did. T he 
lady saw m other andtwo children, of  course in a terrible, exhausted 
condition. She said she'll takeus in. 
 
 
Her sons were very m uch against it,but shesaid

she was a real 
Christian, I say alwa ys.   Am other and two children, she said Ihave to help.

W hat we got was a bed.  That's all we needed.  My m other told herwe have 
nom oney, butthat next day she would go tof ind a job, and she would
 
--
 
whatever she earns she would bring, andfor keeping us. T hat's exactly what 

she did.  
 
 
Shedid thehousekeeping job.  Youhad to steal a littlefood here and 
there.T hat was the way during the war.  She did changethis job a couple of 
tim e s.  
 
 
My sist e r wa s ve r y sick
ly.  She was ver y worri ed aboutm y sister 
because she really wa s sick.  She was alsoworr ied aboutm y sister's hair, 

becausem y sister's hair is com pletely like anaf ro, very, ver y curl y.  In 
Poland, thePolish girls have straight, blondehair.  Mine was w
a vy,  so  it  
wasn't so bad, but she was reall y an af ro.  
 
 
W hat she did, under the pretext she needs tom ake them thicker, she 
shaved herheada couple of times because she was so worried.  
 
 
T here was schoolfor Polish kidsf orone
 
--
 
f ortwo hours aday.  
O ne  
hourfor religion, one hourf or theother things. T hat's where it helped me, 

because I learned thecatechism f rom A to Zver y quickl y, because I could 
read. That was the way they taught religion at the time. I think it's changed 
now.  
 
 
W e wen t  to  c
hurch onSundays, which was lo vel y.  Mass was said in 
Latin.  It was a kindof  nice place to be, and it was warm , the incense was

lovel y and the lights.  It was the only place actually thatfelt a little more saf e, 
som ehow.  
 
 
I was sent over totheneighbor to help,apparently this neighbor was 
som ehow partly German, so he had the rightto have a laborerf orf ree, so I 
was sent tohelp him in the kitchen.  Som y motheralways thought it was 
good to be working.  
 
 
T he Germ ans, all they wanted to know is tha
t ever ybody was workin g 
for them . T hat was the m ain thing.  
 
 
During that tim e, we had one letterf rom ourfriends, who bef orethey 
perished.  Andthat letter was through the Red Cross, that came tous, which 

they forwarded, which told us thatm y f atherwas saf e with his sister in 
Palestine.  
 
 
Now, we knew there was apart of thefam ily that im m igrated to 
Palestine, now Israel, in the 1930s, 1932, I think.  Andthat was m y father's 
sister with herf our children. But we never met them. W edidn't even kno
w 
which town.  But thefact that he was outof  Russia, which was so important, 
because he was a prisonerfor 20 years hardlabor, so thef act thathe was 
out gave us some hope and som ething to hang on to during this terrible tim e.  
 
 
W eha d ve r y l i t t l e i nf

som ething that was adeath penalty as well. He killed pigsf or a livin g.

W e werealwa ys af raid they'd com earound and lookf orhim . They

>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, later. W e had something else in comm on.  Inthe 

m eantim e
,m y m otherwas always tr yin g to think of a surer way, better wa y.  
As I said, she decided that m aybe it would be good to hide inplain sight.  If  
she could work for a Germ an m ilitary camp up the road, she wouldhave an 
idea likethat.  If she was stopped inthe street, if  she showed them  the ID 
workin g f or theGermans, they would let you go.  Otherwise, they m ight 
inquire papers, this, that, orthe other. T his way, shef elt, would be a little 
saf er, because she was forever thinking of  security.  She was w
o rri e d  m y 
sister was playing in the street with curly hair, everything was scar y.  
 

 
So she applied totheGerm anm ilitary cam pfor work.  T hen she told 
her they have to check the papers, so againwe li ved in fearfor weeks.  I

don't know if they ever checked it. W ho knows? T hat far back.  
 
 
Anyway, af terabouteight weeks, she gotthe perm it and started 
workin g as you saw.  She was working in thekitchenpeeling potatoes with 
som e other people. That was her job. She had the Ausweiss, shehadthe 
ID.  A
tthat point, it becam e very im portant, becauseone night the Germ ans 
decided to lookfor the son again, and came great noise and screams. T hey 

usually cam e like that in the m iddleof  thenight.  
 
 
Open the door, they cam e in, they checked, and they took 
everybody 
in, and they said they were looking f orhim . Of course, he wasn't there.  T hey 
were going to take everybody into the stationto check them out. But then m y 
m other gotupand showed the ID. He said "No, you stay."   
 
 
So the only Jews in the place stayed.  
 
[Laughter]
 
T he others were just checked out andbrought, cam eback thenextday, 

because they were all em ployed, working one way or the other. T hat was the 
kind of thing that you had to always be watchful.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other, when
 
youdescribed her, what she did, the 
courage that that took,to not only have a hidden identity, but to go right into 
theden of the enem y,right into their camp and work.  Must have been just

My m other was tooold.  My sister was too young.  But I was there.

I was OK.  My m otheralways said, she keptm e straight, she said"W e

said "But if you're born Jewish, you m ay as well stay Jewish."

on them ain road there was the clapping of horses and carts.W e kids used 
to go and stealfoodf rom  them  som etim es. They were al ways going back 
andforth, but at this point, thism orning, it was completely quiet.  It was a 
deathly silence. W edidn't know what was happening.  
 
 
My m other was still talking about maybe sheshould get up to goto 
work, she didn't know.  I was standing by thewindo w, by the bed. She was 
in bed with m y sister.  Suddenly, there was atrem endous bang, and a bomb 
fell onus.  
 
 
I started scream ing " My hand!  My hand!"
 
My m other got up, grabbed me. The kitchenwas down, I m ean,the roof fell 
down.  My m other
 
grabbedm e by theother hand, we walked into the street.  
T he hospital was about a block anda half away.  She carriedm y sis ter, so 

she couldn't carry m e.  Butm y hand was bleeding badly.  
 
 
W e managed to get to the hospital.  She

they picked me up th

I was in thehospitalf or about two months. Iwanted to say who I was imm ediately, but m y 
m other toldm e that I can't,because, unfortunately, there was apogrom  by the Poles. 
 
 
I'm  not saying all of the Polesare bad, but that was m y experience. Af ew people that came 
outof  hiding were kille d by thePoles.  Ihad to keep the pretenseof being a Catholic. Sothat's what I 
did.  
 
 
In them eantim e,I think the stress onm y m other was so great that she was diagnosed with 
breast cancer, and thedoctorurged usto have the operation,because he didn't w
ant us to be 
orphans.  My m other had to go through that.In them eantim e, shewas writing to whereve r she could, 

and luckily f or usthe radio station inT elAvi v recognized thenam es. There was a lady there, so we 
got in touch with m yfather.  
 
 
My f ather sent a cousin of  m ine, who was in the Britisharm y, and he cam e to putus in touch 
with the Jewish agency. W e had tom ove closer to Krakow.  Again,we had to keep our pretense, 
because we were asked if  we wanted lodging.  " Are you really Polish?"
 
Meanin
g are you Jewis h? W ehad to keep the pretense up, until we got into the main kindof  groupof  

people being taken over to Germ any.  
 
 
W hat they did, they put you in a sort of  com munalhom e,then you were takenby lories, trucks

thef rontier was a Polish guard,and a Russian
