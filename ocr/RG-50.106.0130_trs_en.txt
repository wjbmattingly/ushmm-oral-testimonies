with Alice Master s, conducted

th
, 2000 in Bethesda, Maryland. 
This is a follow up interview that will focus on Alice Mast er s™ post Holocaust experi ences. In 

preparation for this interview I have listene
d to the interview you conducted with the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Nove mb er nint h of 1995. I will not ask you to repeat 

everything you said in th
at interview, instead I will use this 
interview as an opportunity to follow 
up on that interview and focus on 
your post Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side 
A. I would like you to please just esta
blish what was your name  at birth? 
Answer: Alice -- ali -- well, actua
lly it was Alixa Eberstar kova. Eb
erstark, but being a fe ma le it 
is ended with ova, Eberstarkova. 
Q: When we re you born? 
A: May 10, 1925. 

Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: In [indecipherable] Czechoslovakia. 

Q: And whe r e were you during World Wa r II? 

A: In lond -- in England, mostly in London. 

Q: And I would like you to explai
n to me  how you came to work for the Czech governme nt in 
exile in England. 

A: I -- well, I associ ated mostly with ref
ugees, especially with je -- refugees from 
Czechoslovakia. I belonged to a organization called Young Czechoslova ki a.
 And it -- there I met 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

ma ny peopl e who worked in the Czech governme nt. 
Of course, I didn™t have a chance of ever 
getting into the Czech governme nt, but I me t 
a young man who was a -- a private in the Czech 
army and one day my uncle asked me to take something to the Czech government, a document, 
to his friend, mi s -- Dr. Sc hlesinger who worked th
ere, who was a official there. And wi -- on the 
way to going to see Dr. Schlesinger I me t this 
young soldier and he said
 to me , oh, what are you 
doing here? Are you working for the Czech gove
rnme nt?  I said no, no. I -- I don™t know a 
mi nister -- any mi nisters yet. So 
-- because it was so difficult to 
get into it, I™m -- just almost 
impossible. And he said, well come  and see me  at two o™clock. And I went to see Dr. 

Schlesinger, my uncle™s friend a
nd I said, this ma n, I didn™t even know his name , a-asked me  to 
come  and see him at two o™clock. And he said we
ll, if he told you to go and see him, go and see 
him. So I -- I asked him for his name  and hetold me  what his name  was. I described the 

gentlema n to him, and then at two o™clock I went
 to his office, and as 
I enter the offi ce it said, 
Minister Meyer. I was completely stunned b
ecause he was so young, and I had absolutely not 
expected that -- that he would be -- have a -- ha
ve a position like that in the Czech government. 
In any case, he asked [indecipherable] -- should 
I put them here?  And so I saw him and he a-
asked -- of course I was very surprised and he wa
s surprised at my surprise, and he arranged for 
me to take a test. At that tim
e however, I was working for a company that was important for the 
war effort and they [indecipherable] want to rele
ase me , so for six months I was not released, but 
after six months I was -- the position was still held
 for me  and that™s how I got to work in the 
Czech governme nt. But -- should I continue on that? 

Q: What was the test? 

A: Oh well, I -- the test was extremely compli
cated. This mi  -- Minister Meyer called up a 
colleague of his and asked me  to -- asked him to give me  a test. When I came to his office the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

test consisted of -- he asked me
 to translat e the ﬁFinancial  Timesﬂ fr om English to Czech. 
Course, I didn™t understand a word of the ﬁFinancial
 Ti me s ﬂ  in English, let alone in Czech. So I 
sat at the typewriter with the 
ﬁFinancial Time sﬂ staring me  in the face -- mi nd you, I was very 
young, of course, I didn™t understand English ve
ry well, and of course eco-economics was 
beyond me . And I was terribly embarrassed and I di
dn™t know what to do and I decided the best 
thing to do is to just get up and go home , which I di
d, and I left. At that ti
me we -- my  sister and 
I lived at the YWCA. And when I came  home in 
the evening there was a message from Minister 
Meyer saying come back for another test. So I 
was really, really surpri
sed. Obviously he was 
very a-a-anxious to help me  to get into the gove
rnme nt and he wanted me  to have a job. So I 
came back for another test and this time he gave
 me  a sheet of type -- typed ma terial to copy 
type, which was, of course, very easy to do. And that was my second test and that™s how I 
succeeded in getting into the government. 

Q: When you worked for the governme nt in exil
e, what were your dutie
s and responsibilities?   
A: We ll obviously I came in at very low levels, 
but I was a bilingual secretary. Of course I -- 
since I left Czechoslovakia, si
nce I left the school system in
 Slovakia at the age of 13, my 
expertise in the language was very limited. But 
-- and so I™m -- but I s
uppose able to obvi -- 
obviously speak fluently and I was required in th
e Czech governme nt to write and to work in 
Czech. And I was brought up in the 
Slovak schools, so I still hadn™
t learne d the Czech when I got 
into the government, but I ma naged to get thr
ough. I don™t know, one does the best one can and 
survives. And people were very ha -- friendly an
d -- and people helped. And so what I did was 
mostly Czech correspondence and also I did subtitl
es for films. I did the 
-- what do you call it?  
The little te -- the tran
slations, you know, I typed those for Czech films, in Czech. And I did 
Czech and English correspondence.

Q: When exactly di d you start working 
for the Czech governme nt in exile?   
A: I think it was -- I would have to look it up but
 I -- I can™t reme mber exactly. I think it must 
have been in ™44, 1944, ma ybe a little earlier, be
cause I came to England in 1939. I lived in 
Sussex in the children™s home  for 
a year, then I we nt to school 
for another year. And I worked 
for one year at [indecipherable] 
at the bookstore, and then I worked
 -- it must have been foy -- 
™39 - ‚40 -- ™40 -- I would imagine ™43 - ™44 I 
started working for the Czech governme nt. But I 
could easily look it up later and tell you, okay? 
Q: With whom did you work? 

A: Well mos t  -- of course obviously
 I -- I -- all these pe
ople were refugees. I -- one -- I mean, I 
know that the mi nister -- Meyer, 
who was mi nister, I did not work 
with him. He was head of the 
whole thing, I hardly ever saw him. I can™t re
me mber the people™s name s, but I do have -- I 
would ha -- I have it written some where. Th
ere were different people, I me an economists, 
politicians, I mean, I don™t know. I worked for the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Ministry of 
Finance, Industry and Commerce. 

Q: What information were your privy to? 

A: Not very much. I me a n, you know, not really
 much information, just correspondence I don™t 
even reme mber what it is that
 -- who we™re writing about. But I 
did th -- mostly -- I reme mber 
ma ybe, that I did short letters, ei
ther in English or -- or -- or 
Cz ech, and that I did the films. 
Possibly did some  accounting and other wor -- secr
etarial work. But not re
ally. I was not a -- I 
was not privy to any kind of infor ma tion.  

Q: I understand you do -- have said that there 
was nothing that you knew th
at the general public 
didn™t know. 

A: That™s correct , that ™s correct. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

Q: We re you working for the governme nt when th
e Auschwitz protocols were released by the 
Czech governme nt?  I don™t know 
if you could comment on that. 
A: I was, but I™m afraid I don™t know anything about 
it. I really di dn™t at that time. Because first 
of all, we were really in a very --  let™s say it wa
s sort of like in a state 
of shock, let™s put it that 
way. And we were sort of barely ma naging to ex
ist anyway, because we were tryi ng to ma ke a 
living. We  lived through the London blitz, we didn
™t -- I mean, we had to concentrate on 
survival, on surviving and we were
 terribly afraid of what™s go -- 
what™s going on in Europe. We  
heard terrible things but we didn™t wa nt to belie
ve it because we were ve
ry frightened for our 
fa mily. And we just lived from day to day and 
we were mostly together with refugees, other 
refugees. And of course we were just -- were 
not integr ated into the British world. And what 
happened was that we lived, at first -- I mea
n, I don™t know exactly the 
dates, but I would -- I 
would be able to look them up becau
se I kept all the papers, but we 
n -- at first we lived in a chur 
-- when we -- after -- after we left the ho -- childr
en™s home, we lived in 
another girls™ home  run 
by a ger -- German refugee woma n. And we were 
four girls to a home and then we lived -- my 
sister and another friend and I li
ved in a room rented from another -- in a house from a nother 
refugee, a lady. And we socialized
 mostly with other refugees. In
 the evenings we got together 
with other refugees and we just talked about 
our s -- but we had some  very good times together, 
too, we had good social evenings, we  went to the 
theater. We went dancing, we had it -- we were 
very close together because we were all in the sa
me  boat. But we were not included in the life of 
the British, and especially not in Jewish commun
ity. I don™t reme mber that we have ever been 
invited to a Jewish holiday, to a fami ly. I don™t th
ink of -- I don™t think s
o. I can™t remember that 
we ever had a Seder in England, or
 anything like that. So we just
 sort of s-sat around wa iting for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
6 
 
the end of the war because we thought we would 
-- we were very anxious for the war to end so 
that we could go home . 
Q: You me ntioned a mome nt ago that there were 
things that you heard th
at you didn™t want to 
believe. Wh at kinds of things were you h
earing that were -- we
re frightening you? 
A: Well, hear ing terrible thi
ngs about what was going on in th
e [indecipherable] concentration 
camps. We  weren™t sure -- we di
dn't know the extent of -- of th
e things and we hoped -- and we 
always thought that our parents 
and af -- that our father would survive, because we thought -- he 
was very popular in the village 
and he was very important in th
e me  -- running of the village, 
actually, because he was very helpful with things
 like the -- he was friendly with the ma yor and 
he was friendly with the local
 population. He helped whenever there was any kind of problem 
with the fire engines. He was into everythi
ng, actually in -- and he was very handy. He was a 
mechanic and [indecipherable] a farm, we had some
 far m animals and he was very friendly with 
the local population, so I thought 
people would protect him. So we
 were hoping that h -- we kept 
on saying that probably our parent
s would be okay, but still we wo
rried terribly about our friends 
and about the rest of the fa mily. Because my fathe
r™s family, the majority of the fa mily lived in 
Poland, just across the border from where we 
were in Zakopane. We  lived in a northern -- 
northern part of Slovakia, which is very close 
to the Polish border. And so we worried. And of 
course, during the war my father -- I mean, befo
re the war, when Austria was occupi ed and 
Germany -- ther-there was trouble in Germany, my
 father used to walk refugees from those 
countries across the mountains to -- to Poland be
cause they were escaping 
from Aus t ria and from 
Germany. So we worried, of course, about Polan
d, fa mily in Poland. And of course, about our 
grandparents. Oh, and there was one other th
ing. My grandmother, who was -- lived in 
Zakopane, came  to live with our parents, because when things got bad in Poland she came across 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
7 
 
to Czechoslovakia and lived with our parents, an
d we knew that this was going to be extremely 
difficult for our parent s because I knew that my 
father would never leave as -- as long as his 
mother was staying with him.  
Q: In your pr evious interview, you mentioned that
 there was so me anti-Semitism in your village. 
I wanted to ask you, what was the official position of the governme nt in exile on the treatme nt of 

the Jews? 

A: It didn™t come  up in our c
onversation. It didn™t. I didn™t know 
what the position was. I have 
me t people who have been in the Czech Air Force he
re after the war, and they said they -- they -- 
they were an-anti-Semitic. I didn™t experience an
y anti-Semitism in the Czech government at all. 
In fact, ma ny of my coworkers were Jewish re
fugees. So, I mean, I just felt very comf ortable 
there. In fact, the majority -- I mean, I will get 
to that later probably, but most of the people I 
worked with were Jewis
h, okay?  [phone ringing] 

Q: Let me  stop for just one mo ment, we have a 
disturbance. [tape break] Okay, we™re back. I™m 
sorry for that interruption. I had asked you if you had experienced any anti-Semitism with 

respect to your work for the government in 
exile. Did you experience any anti-Semitism any time 
while you were in England? 

A: Yes, actually, we did, and the -- we lived in 
the YWCA for five years. We lived there as long 
as they allowed us to live ther
e, because after five years we ha
d to move . But especially during 
the problems in Palestine, people were very anti-Semitic. I mean, ther e was one woman in 

particular that used to make rema rks which we
re very painful to me. But otherwise the matron 
and the rest of the people were not Jewish -- I mean we were the only Jewish girl -- as far as I 

know we we re the only Jewish -- three Jewish 
girls at the YWCA. And 
I don™t remember that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
8 
 
there was any anti-Semitism except one or two people were anti-Semitic. But of course, they 
were careful when we were around, they didn™t 
say much. But one person was very outspoken. 
Q: What kinds of things did she say? 

A: Oh, she was very angry about what happened 
with Bernadotte, whenhe was assassinated, and 
she f -- said some terrible -- I mean, she had said 
very painful things which were very pr -- very 
painful to me because I felt, si nce we experienced so much anti-Semitism at home and since 

what was going on in Europe, and then we 
are experiencing it in 
England, I felt very 
disillusioned, but you know, that kind -- that 
was the only one, as far as I reme mber.  
Q: While you were in England, were you aware of 
any attemp ts to smuggle Jews into Palestine, 
during the war years especially, 
or immediately after the war? 
A: Not during the war, but immediately afte
r the war I had a cousin who survived a 
concentration camp and I went to 
visit her in Paris. And there sh
e lived in -- outside Paris in a 
home with lots of small children fr om the camps
, and I knew that the [indecipherable] went to 
Palestine. And she was one of the people who wa
s [indecipherable] out, th
at took those children 
to Palestine. But in England, no. Course -- cour
se we were very involve
d with knowing what was 
going on in Palestine and we were very Zionist
ic. I mean we -- I t
hought I would end up in 
Palestine one day, but -- in Israel
, but it didn™t work out that wa y. 
Q: Wa s there any public rush -- recognition in Engl
and of the existence of the Jewish brigade in 
the British ar my? 

A: Not that I know -- I mean, I did -- I wasn™t 
aware of it. But because we were very pa t-
patriotic, we knew about the Czech army, we kne
w about all the other ar
mies, but I didn™t know 
about the Jewish brigade.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

Q: Did you follow the local BBC br
oadcasts and the local newspa
pers regularly during the war 
years? 
A: Yes indeed, we followed the BBC. Every single
 evening at nine o™clock they played the 
national anthems. Af -- and we waited every single
 night at nine o™clock 
to hear the anthem of 
Czechoslovakia, because we were 
se -- I -- unbelievably 
patriotic, when I -- we were just brought 
up that way, that we were just hoping for the en
d of the war and we just wanted to hear the 
national anthem because [indecipherable]. And so 
we listened to the news, we listened to BBC, 
we listened, we read the paper. 
Yes, we knew what was going on, 
as much as possible. Course 
we didn™t underst -- our English was limited, but 
we als -- but we had a lot of infor mations 
through the young Czech clubs.  

Q: How was the liberation of Bergen-Belsen report ed in the British media? 

A: Don™t [indecipherable]. I don™t reme mber mu ch
 about it. I mean, that whole time it was -- I 
don™t know whether it was because we were so fri
ghtened to even think 
about these things or 
look at the papers or hear about
 it, that I don™t recall anything
 about it, really. I don™t even 
reme mber when I first heard about Auschwitz, and I don™t reme mber mu ch, 
except that we lived 
sort of in fear of this, what was going on 
and -- and I don™t reme mber
 how I found out about 
these things. 

Q: How did you learn that the war was over? 

A: I don™t even recall where I was when the war 
was over, but I know that we were -- again, it 
was partly because of fear, because we didn™t know
 what we would find, we were terrified of not 
know -- of what -- what we would find. And we -- 
and we weren™t sure what would happen to us, 
where -- where we would go, what -- of course we
 were all waiting to go home , but we weren™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
10 
 
sure what we  would find, so therefore the wholething was just a complete blank as far as I™m 
concerned. I think I sort of fo
rgot it all, because of fear. I really don™t reme mber it.  
Q: Can you describe the London that you do reme mb
er at the end of war?  What was London like 
when it was over? 

A: You me a n imme diately after the war?  We ll, it 
was completely -- well, fi rst of all, we lived 
through the entire blitz in London, a
nd I think I™ve never been -- ma ybe once I went to a shelter. 

London was -- oh, we were just -- it
 was -- it devastate
d, was bombed, all of it, everywhere. It 
was -- we were very in -- limited in our ra
tions, but everybody had a tremendous spi r it and 
everything -- everybody worked and it -- and look 
-- was excited about the 
end of the war, of 
course, naturally. And there was great excite
me nt that the war was over. Everybody was so 
hardworking and dedicated and they had busines
s as usual everywhere, on every shop, no ma tter 
whether the bombs fell the day before. And we -- as
 far as we were concerned, we were thrilled 
with the war being over. We i mme di ately cabled to
 our village to find out about our parents. We  
ran to all the places where Red Cross posted list
s of people who were -- we  found out about the 
camps at that point and we went , looked to see whether we could 
see the name s of our parents or 
our friends or  our families. And we found the par --
 name s of our parent s on lists that went to 
Auschwitz [indecipherable] and -- and from wha t  poi
nt that was. And we 
just hoped it --  just  
hoped that they would be alive. But we sent the 
cable to the teacher that wa -- lived in our house 
and we -- and to another friend, a
nd we got a cable back saying th
at our parents were sent to 
Poland in the summer of ™42 and they had not retu rned. And I have several of these cables from 

different sources. One from the district bil -- buil
ding in the village, one from our teacher, who 
lived in the house. And then also some body wrote,
 ma ybe he did, that our father was taken to 
Auschwitz and that some body went to visit him, but
 when they came to -- when they went to -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
11 
 
could never understand that because he wrote to sa
y that someone went to see my father and took 
some  clothes to him in Auschwitz, and that when
 they got there they f
ound that my father and 
some  other me n escaped, but that they were cap
tured. But we would never find out any furth -- 
more about that. And we can™t find the document,
 we looked for it. We  can™t find the document 
where he wrote this [indecipherable] so I don™t know. But then we decided that my sister, older 
sister would go back to -- to th
e village, almost immediately to find -- to see, and wait to see 
whether he would returned. Now that™s one thing 
which is absolutely unbe
lie -- I still cannot get 
-- believe that I di dn™t go along with her, because
 I-I think we  -- we were too afraid. I was too 
afraid to go back and -- but I 
wish I wouldn™t have been. I wi
sh I would have gone with her 
because my older si ster was only a year and a ha
lf older than I was, but because she wa s asked 
by my parents to take responsibility for the two of 
us, she was of a more -- we expected her to be 
like a mother to us. And so we decided that sh
e should go by herself. And b -- aside from the fact 
that we didn™t have any kind of
 -- we didn™t have any money to go to -- I mean, it was quite a 
problem to get the money together to send her to 
Czechoslovakia, or -- and she went by herself 
and found that no one came  back.  

Q: When you said no one came back, are you refe
rring just to your fa mily?  What about friends 
and neighbors? 

A: None of the me mbers of my fa mily came back, 
that was --  in the vill
age there was my -- there 
were my parents, my fat her™s mother who ca
me  from Poland to stay with my parents. My 
mother™s father and mother -- stepmother, so 
there were my three grandparents, my aunts, 
cousins, uncles, none of them ca me  back. Appa
rently a few young girls came  back, according to 
my sister, that she saw there. Sh
e went from house to house. Cour 
-- course strangers lived in the 
house and she couldn™t find any of our belongings
. She went from house to house and -- and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
12 
 
found that in -- she found a sewi
ng machine belonging to my mo
ther and other items, and the 
people told her that my mother had given them 
to the -- these -- to them, and she wanted these 
items to be given to this -- to 
three -- to each gi rls who survived, one fami ly. I think there were 
well, ma ybe two girls and she wanted the sewing m
achine to be given to them. But I think she -- 
as far as I know, she found everything, not
hing. Nobody wa nted to return anything. And she 
returned back to England and then we had to ma
ke the decision what to do next, whether to s-
stay, what to do. I mean, we had -- no plans were 
ma de, we were planning to go back home  after 
the war, but when my sister found nobody at home,
 we -- she came back to London and then we 
had to sort of s-sit around waiti
ng to decide what to do next. 
Q: When wa s the full extent of the genocide 
known in England, and what was the British 
reaction? 

A: Now, I know that it was known 
earlier, before the end of the 
war, or during the war, they 
knew that -- what was going on. At
 that time , I -- I think we knew already during the war also 
that things were -- what was 
going on, but people were not sure 
and people died. I knew that 
there were several people who came fr om Poland 
telling the British government and telling the 
world what was going on, but they
 didn™t listen, obviously. And we 
were living in a state of 
shock, not wanting to believe th
at was going on. But we™re too terr
ified, I mean I can™t even say 
sufficiently how afraid we were. And we just di
dn™t want it to be true, but we knew some thing 
horribl e was going on. So, how the Br
itish reaction?  
I didn™t ha  -- 
Q: I™m s -- I™m sorry, I have to interr
upt you because I™m almost out of tape. 
A: Okay. 

Q: Just one mome nt.

Q: -- to the news of the genocide? 
A: I had very little contact with the British peop
le, first of all. Secondly, I know what we were 
talking to among ourselves, to each other. We  
were still refugees. Ev
erybody that I was in 
contact with were people like myself, and we were just too afraid the terr ible thing 

[indecipherable] terrible things
 that were going on. But I don™t th
ink we talked to anyone about 
it. We didn™t. I don™t think -- I mean if -- I kne
w a few British people, my guardian was British. 
But we never talked about these things. She never talked to me  about it
. I -- I guess they were 
trying to protect us. 

Q: What about the newspaper reports and the 
radio broadcasts and -- and the newsreels? 
A: The newsreels? I don™t know. I don™t reme mbe r
 a-any reactions actual
ly, except my own -- I 
reme mber my own reaction [indecipher
able] my sisters. It™s just -- 
Q: We re you aware of the public opinion in Engl
and regarding the question of allowing Jewish 
survivors into Palestine?  

A: Yes, I think there was a lot of -- I reme mber
 the controversy and I reme mber the people were 
wa -- when I heard that people were against allo
wi ng the refugees to go to Palestine -- I mean, 
there were some  who we re for it and some  against 
it, there was a lot of debate. I remember that, 
but can™t reme mber details.  

Q: Is there anything that stands
 out in your mi nd from the -- the pe
riod of time  toward the end of 
the war and imme diately after the war was over, 
what -- what stands out
 in your mi nd about 
those days aside from your fear?  Is there an
ything else that -- th
at come s to your mi nd? 
A: We  -- immediate -- immediately after the war?  
We ll [indecipherable] main thing that stands 
out in my mind was just not knowi
ng what to do next, as far as 
we were concerned. I mean, I™ m

talking about personal thi
ngs. And about what would -- I mean, it was such a very difficult time, 
I can™t reme mber exactly. I mean just about up 
-- us personally, I suppose, abs -- well -- no, I 
don™t -- well, the ma in thing was what to do with
 ourselves and how to deal with how to go on 
because -- and what to do about go back to C
zechoslovakia, stay in England. What do you do?  I 
mean, it was very, very traumatic. So I -- I 
-- I just hit a blank,
 honestly, I don™t know.  
Q: How long did you continue to work 
for the Czech governme nt in exile? 
A: Well I couldn't -- I kept on -- I stayed on with
 the governme nt and it was -- the war ended in 
1945. In 1947 I received a letter, I think -- 
no. Wa it a mi nute, no, in 1947 was the annual 
meeting, second annual meeting of Internati
onal Monetary Fund in London, in September 1947. 
And I -- see, right -- immediatel
y after the war ended, most of 
the people who were working for 
the Czech government in exile went back, and the 
top officials went back to -- imme di ately went  
back to Czechoslovakia. I forgot, that™s when
 you asked me what -- 
what happened immediately 
after the war. We ll, they knew they couldn™t wa
it fast enough -- to get back to Czechoslovakia 
fast enough, so ma ny of them, ma ny of the peopl
e I worked with and ma ny of the people who 
belonged to the [indecipherable] Czechoslovaki a 
at the time who were 
-- I was with a lot, 
imme diately packed up and went back to Czechos
lovakia. That was -- also included pe ople like 
Madeline Albright™s father and the family went 
back immedi ately after th
e war. Many of these 
people were people that I knew very well because  
I worked with them. A
nd -- but I didn™t even 
think for a mome nt that I would go back. I mean, 
I was just allowed to stay, so we -- we go, and 
the exile continued in czecho -- 
in London and I worked for the mi
nistry, same mi nistry with 
Minister Meyer. He was also one
 that went back immediately. 
And I -- so in ™47, one of the 
people who went back, who was a good friend of mine, whose name  was  Latso Biele, I think he 

was a Jew, want -- cabled to the mi nistry in Lo
ndon to say that I was to be assigned to work for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
15 
 
the International Monetary Fund conference. That
™s how -- that™s how the whole thing evolved. 
And I was to be assigned to the -- the Czech 
delegation, which consists of 15 people, the 
governor of the bank of Czechoslovakia and the 
executive director for the bank of -- for the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a
nd he cabled to my boss and said that I was 
to -- he didn™t communicate with me  at all. I was 
not in touch with him at all after he went back 
to Czechoslovakia, but he cable
d and said that I was to be 
assigned to work with a co -- 
delegation comi ng to London from the Internat
ional Monetary Fund. It was the second 
[indecipherable]. And I absolutely refused to go, 
because I said I couldn™t do it because it was 
going to be a very high level delegation and it 
was a -- it was a huge annual meeting, and I was 

absolutely petrified. I honestly didn™t think I wa
s able to do this job. It was -- and he wouldn™t 

take no for an answer. I mean, not to me , I -- as I 
said, I had never been in
 touch but directly to 
my superiors. And he said I have to do it. And I 
said no, I couldn™t do it, I 
just couldn™t. I was too 
inexperienced and I was too young and I was too afraid of it. And I said, no
 I couldn™t. And they 
said yes, you will have to do it. So I was assigne
d to work with them, and I went to work with 
them. There are 15 of them here in London, and it worked out very well, of course. I mean, there 

are -- it was very good. In fact, one of them 
said to me, don™t -- why 
-- would you like to come  
and work in Washington?  And I said -- I didn'
t know much about the In
ternational Monetary 
Fund, nor did I know anything about the World 
Bank and I asked him which organization I 
should apply for and he told me  well, he likedthe International Monetary
 Fund better. And so I 
was sent for a test, and I didn™t ta
ke it seriously, I thought I would 
take a test just to see how I 
would do, for my own benefit. And 
I took the test and I just for
got completely about the whole 
thing, never thought about it again. I 
never expected that I would be offered this job. But then, in 
March 1948, when the communists took over Czechos
lovakia, I came to the office one day and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
16 
 
on my desk was a letter recalling me  back to Pra
gue. So all of us who we re then working for the 
Czech governme nt were asked to return to Pr
ague imme diately by the communist governme nt. 
As soon as I opened the letter, I sa
id, that™s the end of my career w
ith the international -- with the 
Czech governme nt, because I wasn™t going to go b
ack to Czechoslovaki a, to the Czech -- under 
the communists. And I left -- I asked my boss that
 morning to -- whether 
I could go and take the 
morning off, and I took off and started -- went 
looking for another job. A
nd I came back to the 
office late in the afternoon having found a new 
job. And whe n I got back there was a me ssage 
from my sister to say that I ha
ve a letter from International M
onetary Fund. It was -- the whole 
thing happened the very same  day. The Czech governme nt recalled me  ba ck to Prague. I found a 

new job the same  mo me nt and in 
the afternoon I had the letter o
ffering me an appointme nt with 
the International Monetary Fund. I was shock, abso
lutely shoc k because I never expected to be 
hire by the International Monetary Fund in Wa
shington, and I didn't r
eally want to come , 
because I didn™t want to -- by this time I ha
d settled down in London quite comfortably. My 
sisters were there, my friends we
re there and I wasn™t going to go 
by myself to America to start a 
new job. And I just didn™t want to do it. So I sa
id, oh no, I can™t believe th
at I got this job, I don™t 
want it. But then I thought to my
self, if I don™t go -- if
 I don™t go I™ll never forgive mys e lf, I have 
to try. And so I immediately cabled back to the 
managing director because they liked -- because  

since only high level people were hired from abro
ad, not at my level, and a letter was signed by 
the ma naging director and I cabled back -- I cab
led back to the ma naging director of the 
International Monetary Fund, appointme nt accepte
d, which I laughed about for years afterwards, 
because I thought it was so funny. When I came to
 the fund I realized that it was a funny 
response on my part to a managing director  to 
say appointme nt accepted. But in any case, I did 
accept appointme nt for the simple reason that I t
hought we™ve got to get on 
with our lives. If I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
17 
 
don™t leave London my sister, my ol
der sister will never get -- l
eave us, we™ll al
l live together, 
she™ll never ma rry and I have to break up the trio
. So I decided to leave for America, but I only 
was going to leave for one year. And I™m here still. 
Q: Before I have you leaving England co
mpletely, you were still in London -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- the end of ™45 and ™46 and ™47 and there wa
s a lot going on. I would li
ke you to take just a 
mome nt and -- and tell me , ho
w mu ch did you know of what  was going on in Czechoslovakia 
before the communists took over?  How much 
did you know and how mu ch did the general 
public know about what was going on in Czechoslovakia? 

A: Do you mean in Cze c hoslovakia itsel
f, or with the Jewish community? 
Q: Both. 

A: Oh, in Czechoslovakia I knew a lot of was go -- what was going on because I worked -- well, 

in those years in Czechoslovaki
a I knew -- let™s s
ee now, when the communists took over in 
1948, I knew that the mi nister, our mi nister, Meye
r, who then became Minister of Commerce -- I 
can™t reme mber exactly what he wa
s at the end -- that he refused 
to meet with Parliame nt when 
the communists took over and they beat him up a
nd he was thrown out -- even refused to s -- 
leave his seat in Parliame nt. And I reme mber
 that he was beaten up by the communists and 
thrown out of Parliame nt and he finally arrive
d in America. He was 
a refugee just  like many 
other refugees. And I knew that some  of the pe
ople who returned to Czechoslovakia from the 
Czech governme nt like −ling and Löbl , ma ny of th
em were executed by the communists. Some  
of my friends actually were executed. I don™t kno
w exactly what they were accused of. So well, 
there was a real struggle within
 the Czech government in -- in Czechoslovakia, obviously, the 
communists finally succeeded in taking over.Wh at other question --
 what did you ask me ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
18 
 
Q: Also during this time  in history -- 
A: Mm-h m?  

Q: -- the war crimes trials began. 

A: Mm-hm, yes. 

Q: Did you personally get involved 
at all in any of the trials? I 
just wanted a sense of how the 
trials were  covered in British pr ess.  

A: I did get involved with that, I applied to work
 at the Nuremberg trials, but I did not accept the 
job, ma inly because my German wasn™t good enough. And I did take a test to work with the 

Nuremberg trials, actually. But 
I didn™t get the job and I -- it was a shame because I really 
wanted to do be there. But -- and I don™t exac
tly know when it was, but
 I -- I knew about that, 
because I followed that, and -- but you know, I 
can™t reme mb er details any more about it, 
because everything -- you know, so much has happene
d since then. How can I reme mber ev -- all 
the details?  Of course, I did fo
llow it all and well, it™s a blur . 
Q: Did you have a sense that ju
stice was served?  Did you personally
 have a sense that justice 
was served in Nurember g? 

A: In Nuremberg?  I don™t know, I didn™t think th
at justice was served altogether in Europe, 
because I fel -- I felt ma ny of the people, es
pecially I mean, the pe
ople that I would -- in 
Czechoslovakia, people like Hlinka
 and Tiso and all the fascists, 
justice was not served, and all 
the people who responsible for what happene
d, how could -- I would, you know, I don™t see how 
that ever will be [indecipherable]. And in Nu
remb erg, I guess they did the best they could, 
anyway. I don™t know. Certainly justice wasn™t serv
ed because when I was 
in Europe this last 
summer, in Czechoslovakia, in sl -- actually
 two years ago, they™re 
bil -- building a docu -- 
monume nt to -- they™re bu
ilding a monume nt to Hlinka, who was 
the head of the fascist party in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
19 
 
Slovakia during the war. And so I asked them, how can you build a monument to a fa scist 
leader?  And they said, well, some  people think he
 was a fascist and other people think he was a 
liberator because he was responsible
 for the division, for the -- what
 the -- he -- they call the free 
Slovakia. So where is the justice? 

Q: Did you get a sense from the British press and the British people around you that they felt 

justice was se rved at Nuremberg? 

A: First of all when I told you, we hardly any ch-- any close -- we hardly had any contact with 

British pe ople. It™s very strange when I look back
 at, because  -- well, the only pe-people that I 

was really close to in Britain were my -- wa
s my guardian. And my guardian was very ma -- 
[indecipherable] that she was my
 guardian because he hadn™t ch -- if she hadn™t signed for me  I 

wouldn™t have been in England in the first pl ace. So
 she did her bit. But they did not really ha ve 
anything much to do with us. I mean her family. She was very nice to me , I mean she i-invited 

me  to lunch, she gave me a little pocket money. Sh
e was in touch with me, but she did not talked 
about politic o-of siti -- ma tters of
 what was going on, generally. And her fa mily had never really 
done anything for me , that I told you [indecipherabl
e] were invited to an
y of the things. But -- 
and otherwise I don™t reme mber that we had any 
contacts with any British group. Honestly we 
just mostly were together with
 refugees. And of course, among our
selves we talked about these 
things and we  -- when, you know, we discusse
d what was going on, and in the -- but I don™t 
know what the British -- except for the few people 
that I me t at the Y -- YWCA, there, and I was 
afraid actually, to ask them for [indecipherable]
. I would not have discussed these ma tters with 
them, you know, because I never wanted to hear
 what they had to say. You know, I was too 
afraid that they ma y say things that would be upsetting to me .  

Q: By the end of 1945 there was growing unrest in 
Palestine with respect 
to the British ma ndate. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
20 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: I was wondering if you can recall some  of that
 time period an-and some of those events with 
the conflict with the British and 
the beginnings of the U.N. debate and that whole episode in 

history. Can you recall any -- anything about that? 

A: Well, very little really. I rec -- well, I recal
l what was going on and I th -- I -- it was a big 
debate about the -- about Palestin
e, and I was hoping very muc h -- of course naturally we were 
all hoping that we would have a state of Israel. 
And I just -- I th -- I don™
t reme mber, honestly, I 
don™t remember how I reacted. I 
-- I didn™t -- mainly I was -- 
I don™t reme mber how I  -- how 
things went. I don™t.  

Q: Do you by any chance reme mber the positi
on of the Czech governme nt on the partition?   
A: I think the Czech government, that was very 
-- now, when I read about
 it in the -- recently 
when I read about it, I wa -- Czechoslovakia di
d a -- had a great hand in es -- su-supporting the 

establishment of Israel . I think they supplied Israel
 of -- Israel at the time
 with planes, tanks. As 
far as I know Czechoslovaki
a was great, great help.  
Q: We re you aware that there were Jews escaping 
from Poland via Czechoslovakia, to try to get 
to the American zone to get to Palestine?  
A: No, I wasn™t. 

Q: You me ntioned that you thought
 of -- of -- you thought of yourse
lf as a Zionist, but some how 
that didn™t happen. Wa s there a time when a -- wh
en Israel declared it
s independence that you 
ever considered -- 

A: Going to -- 

Q: -- going over to Israel?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
21 
 
A: Yes, I did. I thought -- during the war -- oh, I -- 
I thought if my parents 
didn™t survive that I 
would end up in Israel -- in Pale
stine at the time, but in is -- Is
rael. And for many, many years, I 
thought that™s where I would go. Of course then 
things change d because I came to the States. I 
mean yes, I thought I would go to Israel because 
I -- my father would have. If my mot her had 
agreed to do it, she wo -- he would left for Palestin
e in the fi  --  in the 30™
s, but I think my mother 
was reluctant to go. And I thought 
-- I belong to ma ny Jewis h orga
nizations -- well, I did belong 
to some  organi -- Jewish organizations in Engl
and. I belonged to -- can™t 
reme mber the name of 
it, but it was sort of a farm organization, I we
nt to a camp, Jewish camp. Can™t reme mber the 
name . I belonged to Maccabi Hatzair. And I was goi
ng to emi -- to go to Pa
lestine -- to Israel. I 
thought, if I am going to die fighti
ng for anything, I would fight toge
ther with the Jews in -- in 
Palestine. But it di dn™t work out that  way. 
Q: Where did you have citizenship until 1948? 

A: We ll, when I came out there was, of course 
che -- Czech. And then I didn™t want to become  a 
British citizen because I didn™t think I would stay
 in Britain. So I did 
not apply for British ci-
citizenship. So in 19 -- when my pa ssport expire
d -- when my pa -- when we came to England 
we had a passport, a Czech passport, okay, 
Czechoslovak passport. Then I -- probably I 
[indecipherable] when I -- I -- I 
came to the States and I had a 
Czechoslav passports. When that 
passport expired in ™48 or whenever
 it was, I -- I had -- I did not 
apply for citizensh
ip in Britain. 
And so I traveled on some thing called affidav
it [indecipherable] passport, so I was -- was 
stateless, because I wasn™t sure where I was going
 to end up and I didn™t want to just become  a 
British citizen if I didn™t intend to stay. So I deba
ted what to do and then of course I fi nally be-
became American citizen in 19 fif -- ™52?  ™54?  So me thing like that.  

Q: Do you reme mber when, exactly, 
you arrived at the United States? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
22 
 
A: Yes, I came  in March 1948. 
Q: What were your expectations of America? 

A: Well, when I first arrived, I came here for one 
year only, because I thought I wanted to live in 
England. But when I arrived I was absolutely th
rilled because I felt immediately at home in 
America, and that was much closer to my home
 in Czechoslovakia than it was -- ever  was in 
England. In England I was always a refugee, an
d in England I was alwa
ys -- people would ask 
me  always, when are you going home. From the da
y we arrived practically, they would ask us, 
when are you going home. So they never assume d 
that we would ever stay there. And so we 
always felt like refugees. And in America I felt 
at home  imme diately. Th
ere were many things 
that were very similar to my upbr
inging at home. So I stayed here. 
Q: Such as? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Such as?  What things were similar? 
A: Oh, well fi rst of all I was -- 
I felt comfortable here because 
there were lots of people who 
were like myself, from all over the world, okay?
 Secondly, the food, the e-everything, the people 
were welcoming and I felt very comfortable. Nobody asked me  when are you going home , they 
said you wouldn™t want  to leave, you want to stay 
here, it is the place to live. And so I felt I was 
wanted here and I was welcomed here and I want
ed to stay here. And so e-even though I came  

for a year, I almost immediately decided this is 
the place where I™ll always stay. And after -- but 
since I wasn™t quite sure what I was going to do, 
I went home -- I went back to England after one 

year. And on the way, in a flight going over to 
England, I ma de my decision that I would come  
back here and stay here. So it -- it didn't  take l
ong to persuade me  to stay here. In England, of 
course, you know, we were never made
 to feel -- I mean, I must say, I was very grateful, England 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
23 
 
was wonderful and they gave us refuge. I m
ean, America didn™t do that. I mean, we had 10,000 
children who were allowed to come  to England, 
whereas in America were hardly any refugees 
allowed to come , whereas -- so England was very
, very good, but they wanted us to come  and 
leave. That was the difference. 
Q: Did any of the Americans ask you about your 
experiences before the wa r and during the war? 
A: I have never talked to anyone about it, ev
er to anyone. Not in England, by the way, when I 
lived there, I just didn™t disc
uss my situation with anyone ever
. And then I worked in the Fund 
for 35 years, and I™ve never talked to anyone 
about it either. And nobody ever asked me  and I 
never talked -- tel -- told anyone. 
It™s very strange -- it
™s very strange that I™ve never talked to -- 
well, the first time that this came up was when I went to England for the 50
th
 anniversary -- was 
it --  the 50
th
 anniversary of the Kindert
ransport, okay?  It was 19 [i
ndecipherable] ™89. I think it 
was the 50
th
 reunion of the Kindertransport. And we -- 
when the article came  out in ﬁWashington 
Postﬂ -- 
Q: Wa it, you™re jumping ahead of me , can we - -  
A: Oh yes, okay. 

Q: -- ca-can we wait on that til we get ther e? 

A: Okay. But you asked me  about 
-- what was the question before? 
Q: I asked you if anybody in the United States 
asked you about your experiences during the war 
or before the war. 

A: No, no one ever asked me  and I wa
s not willing to tell them, either.  
Q: You were in the United States already wh
en Israel declared itself independent. Do you 
reme mber that experience? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
24 
 
A: Of course. Of course I reme mber it. I reme mb
er it very well, this 
great mome nt and a great 
thrill, and I was very, very excite
d about it and I was very sad that 
my father didn™t live to see the 
day. And what can I say? 
Q: Do you think that the fact that you were in 
the United States for that event ma de a difference 
in your ability to recall the hist
or y of this particular event? 
A: I™m sure it must have, yes, because I felt that
 there was great support in -- in the United States 
for the establishment of the state of Israel. A
nd I fe lt at home and comfortable and thrilled with 
the victory. 

Q: We ™re going to pause andI™m going to change tapes. 

A: Yeah, did you know -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
25 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Alice Mast
ers. This is tape two, side A. And 
before I start with your -- your new 
job in the United States, there™
s one question I really want to
 ask you about wartime England. 
You me ntioned that you never went down to th
e shelter. Did other pe
ople go, and why didn™t 
you go? 

A: I -- other people -- yes, people were -- the und
ergrounds we re covered with people, of course, 
from wall to wall, lying in the underground a-a
nd people were going to shelters. I didn™t go for 
various reasons. I suppose I wanted to -- for -- 
somehow I thought it™s okay to s -- nothing will 
happen to me. I don™t know how I thought that. 
And also I felt, you know, what will happen, 
happens. I mean, I just let it go. I couldn™t face go
ing to a shelter for some  reason. But I was -- I 
went up on the roof -- when I lived at the YWCA, we went up on the roof, and I was a 

firewatcher. We slept with our 
gas masks and -- and our -- everyt
hi ng re -- at the ready in case 
we had to run out of the house. And I would go 
up on the roof and watch for fires and I had a 
helmet, a gas ma sk and I went up on the roof and 
watched for fires, and --
 but I think I had -- I 
recall ma ybe I went to a shelter once, when I stay
ed at my uncle™s house, once. But I -- I can™t 
reme mber any other time that I went to it. I 
just decided it was going 
to be okay one way or 
another. 

Q: I™d like you to tell me  about your new job 
in America. What was your job title and -- and 
what were your responsibilities 
and your duties and all of that? 
A: When I was hired to work at the Fund, I wa
s hired specifically for one person who was my 
boss. He was a -- from Slovakia, he was Czech, he
 was an economi st. He was head of a division, 
the ce-central eastern European division. And I 
was hired in a quo -- all of us very, very young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
26 
 
and very inexperienced actuall
y, although I had worked for the 
Czech government, I had a -- I 
was hired in a high leve l because I was a bilingua
l secretary. It happened so that one of the 
delegates who was -- who I worked for in the 
1947 annual meeting was also a -- was a ch -- 
Czech delega tion. He was executive director and 
he thought that I should work for some one who 
was a Czech, because at the time  Czechoslovaki a 
was a me mber of the International Monetary 
Fund, which a -- it was just before the communist
s. After I arrived in 
America, Czechoslovakia 
withdrew from the International 
Monetary Fund, so we had to be
 a -- the executive board had to 
ma ke a decision to allow us to continue to work, even though Czechoslovakia was no longer a 

me mber, and we were all Czech citizens. So in 
any case, I was hired as
 secretary -- bilingual 
secretary to the chief of that 
division. So that I was already 
a head of a -- I mean, I was his 
secretary, therefore I was in char
ge of the entire division. And 
I h -- there were several other 
secretaries working un-under me . And I worked with
 him. He was the [indecipherable] director 
of European department and then he became director
 of anothe r departme nt and I -- I grew with -
- with -- I was promoted too, as an admi nistrativ
e officer and I could have had other -- I could 
have changed my position to do -- do other j
obs which were more sa -- w- with more 
responsibilities, but I decided to
 st ay with this ma n and work 
with him until he retired. Then I 
stayed with the firm for 35 years, because th
ey we re ch -- exciting. I traveled on several 
mi ssions. And it was a wonderful job a
nd I loved it and well, that™s it. 
Q: When you came here, where did you se
ttle?  Where did you first find residence? 
A: When I first arrived I was -- I came here, 
I think the fi rst of April when I arri ved in 
Washington, and -- cause the cherry blossom fes
tival, and the Fund -- at 
that time  there were 
very few hotels and very few places availabl e a
nd the Fund was very apologetic because they 
couldn™t get a room for me  at a hotel. So they we
re very apol ogetic because all the hotels were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
27 
 
full and they asked whether I would mi nd very much
 if I could spend a coupl
e of nights, the first 
two nights at the international -- 
at  the international student house. And I was absolutely thrilled 
about -- with that, because I though
t, if I ended up in a hotel by myself I would have been very 
lonely. But the international student house was just
 exactly what I needed, 
and it was just exactly 
my kind of environment, so I was taken there bychauffeur and I was depo
sited the international 
student house, and I was imme diately surroundedby students fr om all over the world including 
some  people who were already working at the Fu
nd. One of them was in the legal departme nt, a 
lawyer from Holland. One wer -- one was a economi
st from New York who worked at the Fund, 
and we -- we™ve been friends ever since that first 
day that I met them at the international student 
house and they were both working at the Fund. We™v
e been friends for all these years, 60 years. 
Is it 60 years almost?  No, 50-some  years. And I 
was immediately integr at ed, taken in, the fi rst 
night that I arrived in America,
 I was imme diately asked whether 
I want to go to the theater or 
whether I wa nted to go to the ballet, or whether 
I want to go to concert and I was never free from 
that day on. 

Q: Did you get any additional e
ducation in the United States? 
A: We ll first of all, they asked me  what kind of
 education I had in the 
-- in -- in England, which 
was very limited, of course, you know? 

Q: That™s on the other tape. 

A: Oh, is it? Very limited, very. In America 
when I started working at the fund, I thought I 
should go back to school, course. So I went, I re
gistered with the George
 Washington University 
for a course in economics. Wa sn™t easy, but so wh
en I came to the interview, they said where are 
your documents, your papers, whether you can come  in
to university?  I said, I have no papers at 
all because all my papers were destroyed duringthe war. So the person who interviewe d me  said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
28 
 
that™s fine, you are in. So I went in and I took a co
urse in economics, which wasn™t -- I kept it up 
I think, for one year, that™s it. And then I was 
-- got too busy, I didn™t do any more. But I did take 
economics, that™s about it.  
Q: When you came here, did you start to connect 
with any Jewish groups 
or Jewish refugees?   
A: No, I stayed mostly [indecipherable] the inte
rnational student house. I did not connect with 
any refugees. I mean, we  were -- you know, I work
ed at the Fund, I was at the international 
student house. I tried -- well, I di
dn™t talk to you about my -- my father was very religious and we 
went to the synagogue every Friday night and ev
ery Saturday morning. When I came to England, 
I couldn™t go to a synagogue. I just couldn™t face 
going to a synagogue. It was very pa inful, so I 
never went to. And whe n I did go, I just coul
dn't believe that people spoke English in a 
synagogue, because in my village they all spoke 
only he -- [indecipherabl
e] only in Hebrew, and 
there wasn™t any foreign words 
spoken except Hebrew. In England 
they all spoke English, they 
were very casual. And so I couldn™t bear being 
in synagogue, and in any ca
se [indecipherable] be 
very upsetting to me . And the same  thing happene
d here in America. When I came here, I tried 
to go maybe to a service once or twice, but I co
uldn™t face it, and besides, I completely turned 
against religion, because my parent
s were -- my father, my mother wasn™t as religious as my 
father, but my father was extrem
ely religious and I fel -- felt that
 with all the praying that my 
father did and all the beliefs that, and this ha
ppened, I just couldn™t face going to the synagogue, 
I just didn™t feel comfortable. Bu
t I have struggled with it all my life, I have struggled with that , 
because I didn™t know what to do. And s -- I ne ve
r -- I have not belonged to any synagogue, but I 
always feel I should. And I feel I should andI should and I don™t know 
what to do and I still 
haven™t come to terms with it. It ™s -- it™s a re
al problem for me. It™s 
a real problem for me  
because I s -- I feel 
that I ought to belong.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

Q: How did you meet your husband? 
A: Oh. How did I meet my -- I me t my husband 
in London in 1947, ex -- a-actually I me t hi m 
exactly during the time  of the [indecipherabl e]
 because I was going out 
with a -- an -- an -- 
commander friend of Peter™s -- of my  husband™s, 
okay?  He wa s -- so I me t Peter, my husband, 

through this friend of mi ne, and I 
-- well, actually he saw me  off when I was going to America. 
My friend asked Peter to see -- to
 help me mi  -- make arrangement
s for my trip to America. So 
he came along with me  to [indecipherable] and ma
de arrangeme nts -- oh, he -- he was with me, I 

ma de the arrangeme nts, he just stood by while 
I ma ke. And then I me t him again when he came 

to the States. He as a Fulbright scholar and came ™49. And when I went back to England after 

fi rst --  my fi rst year  in America, my friend told
 me that Peter Masters was in New York and he 
asked me  to take a book to him, which I did. I went
 back again and that™s -- actually we saw each 
other for the first time , even though we double da
ted in England during the war -- or, after the 
war, I didn™t know hi m during the war, after 
the war we double dated, we were engaged to 
different people. He was engaged to an Irish gi
rl and I was engaged to his friend. But then, it 
wasn™t really a definite engageme nt because I wa
sn™t su -- I wouldn™t have
 left for America if I 
felt that I wanted to ma rry him. So I came to Am
erica, Peter was here, we saw each ot her for the 
first time , actually, by ourselves. We  got enga
ged almost immediately and married shortly 
afterwards. And that will 
be 50 years next April. 
Q: What was your -- your very brief, a
pparently, what was your courtship like? 
A: You me a n with my husband, or -- it was a 
very brief courtship. Actually, in London during 
the war, when I first -- when I first met Peter,
 I had an aunt in London who was at the party 
where I met Peter, and she said -- she called me 
aside and she said to me
, why can™t you have a 

boyfriend like Peter Masters? Why must you always 
have boyfriends like this other ma n?  And so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
30 
 
when we me t in New York and we got at -- it
 was almost imme diate attraction and we got 
engaged almost imme diately. And so I was able 
to write to my aunt, guess what?  I™m going to 
ma rry Peter Masters. Because she said, why can™t
 you have a boyfriend like Peter Masters, why 
must you always date these other guys? 
Q: You have children? 

A: We  have three children and act
ually it™s been very -- Peter a
nd I are ve -- are very well -- I 
mean, we are very well suited, because Peter a
nd I come  from very similar backgrounds, except 
he come s fr om Vienna, which is a big city and 
I come from a little vill
age. But he has total 
understanding of who I am and wh
at I am and he has enormo us empathy in -- about how I feel 
about things, and understand each other totally. 
It™s been a very, very good 50 years.  
Q: You were a working mother? 

A: I was a -- I was a working mother, I have 
never stopped working, actually. And my -- and my 
daughters always feel, especially my mi ddle dau
ghter Kim, always actually stayed -- ma kes a 
point of telling me  how proud she was that I wa
s a working mother, because she thought it was a 
marvelous example for her. But I always was torn
 by being a working mo ther. I felt that I -- it 
would have been very good for my kids if I coul
d have been with them. But I had a very strong 
need to work, to be independent because when I 
was growing up my mot her -- my father was, of 
course, working, my mother wasn
™t and my mother wa -- had to ask him every morning she had 
to ask him for some mo ney to -- to buy grocerie
s and to buy necessities and he would always -- 
he didn't have very much, you know, my -- we had 
it -- more than plenty 
to live on comfortably, 
but not -- he didn™t have really em -- any kind of
 bi -- money to s -- extra money to spend. So he 
would always be -- ma ke it -- there was always 
a problem and I would watch it and I -- it would 
upset me to see my mother aski
ng for money. And I said to myself
, I will never put myself in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
31 
 
that position where I will have to ask for money. I 
want to be independent. And I just had a need 
to be not only independent during my working li
fe, because the money during my working life -- 
my work time, I -- I -- didn™t mean that much. I 
only wanted to be sure that I have worked 
enough for my retireme nt, that I would not be de
pendent on anyone. So I felt the need to work. 
And besides, I thought it was good for everybody. It 
-- ma ybe it was best for my children that I 
wasn™t around all the time on one hand. On the othe
r hand, it would have been great to be with 

the children and I some times think that it would 
have been better for some  of my children if I 
had been around. But that™s how it wa s. 

Q: You me ntioned a little while
 ago that you were conflicted a
bout going back to synagogue and 

belonging [indecipherable]. What Je
wish traditions did you observe 
in your fa mily while raising 
your children? 

A: We  li -- we did observe all the Jewish holiday
s. Not all, I mean the major holidays. We had 
Seder. We  observed Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Hanukah. All the holidays we observed, 
but we did not go to a -- the chil
dren not -- did not go to Sunday 
school and they did not go to -- 
we didn™t go to any services, except for the high ho
lidays. But we did not belong to any, so we -- 
synagogue, so we actually had to go wherever 
we  could go. Now, my ol dest daughter, Ann 
ma rried a non-Jew, but she in -- her children go 
to Sunday school, and she is having her son Bar 
Mitzvahed, which I am very proud of her that 
she is doing that. And 
the other children are 
consciously Jewish, but they don™
t belong to any synagogues either. 
Q: I wanted to ask your children™s na
me s and how you selected the name s. 
A: My oldest daughter is Ann Valerie ma s -- 
Ann Valerie Sedonia. Sedonia was my mother™s 
name , so she is name d after my mother. How 
Ann?  Oh, my grandmother was Anna, or Hannah, 
and so her first name  is and -- for my grandmother. Ki m -- my second daughter Kim, her first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
32 
 
name  is Laura -- oh, there were -- Ann has anot
her name , Ann Valerie Masters. Ann wa s name d 
after my grandmother and Valerie was the lady at
 the international stud
ent house where we had 
our wedding. And she was the ma nageress of the st
udent house, and we name d her after her, here 
in Wa shington. And Sedonia was my  mother. Laura 
Kim, she was name d after no one. And ha -- 
Tim, my son Howard was name d afte r Peter™s friend Howard. And that™s it. 
Q: In your ot her interview, you spoke about t
eaching your children morality, and I wanted to -- 

to ask you to -- to elaborate on what exactly that meant. Wha t  did you teach your children a-

about Judaism, about mo rality, a
bout all of those kinds 
of things that parents impart to their 
children?  

A: We ll, we taught our children pra -- to be decent
 human be ings; to have ethics, and to -- to be 
honest and good people. To be good to each other b
ecause my mother always was very -- that™s 

one thing she always wanted is that we are good 
to each ot her. Of course, it doesn™t always work 
that way with our kids. We™ve had our ups and downs, okay? But we try to set a good example 
for our children and we taught them to -- not to 
ha -- be prejudiced against other people. We  
lived in an integrated community in Washington. We
 tried to teach them to
 be tolerant of other 
people, they -- in fact, we overdid it, because
 we stayed in a school system where you could 
hardly s -- find another white face, except my 
daughter™s, until it was -- maybe it was a little 
overdone because it was during th
e upheaval of the 60™s, okay?  
So our children went through -- 
we lived in a neighborhood calle
d neighbors incorporated, which 
was in Washington, D.C., and 
the school system wasn™t [indecipherable] all th
e time. But -- and my husband Peter, who is a 
eternal optimist, thought that we could ma nage to 
integrate -- I mean, to balance the schools. But 
it didn™t work that way, because it just didn™t wo
rk. And finally we had to move. But the chil -- 
our oldest daughter went though th
e entire school system in elem
entary school, junior high and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
33 
 
high school in Shepherd™s -- Shepherd Park, then
 [indecipherable] and in Coolidge High School. 
And Ki m also stayed in the junior high in the 
district and with Timot
hy, we  -- our youngest son, 
we moved over to Bethesda. But in any case, our 
children have been brought
 up to be activists.  
Q: You were definitely raising child
ren during a very turbulent time -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- in this country. You talked
 a little bit about 
the schools and everything, but what about 
some  of the other things that were happening in
 the 60™s, like the sexual revolution and Cold 
War. Do any of those big social upheavals of th
e 60™s stand out in your mi nd?  Did you have any 
reactions to any of them 
because of your personal history, anyt hing like that? 
A: Like literally I™m -- we went through a whole 
f -- I mean our children 
literally had been -- it 
wasn™t such a problem in -- in the sexual revolu
tion, but with the -- just the school system was a 
problem for us. Our children really didn™t particip
ate in any of the social
 things in the schools, 
because of the upheaval. And the Cold Wa r, I me an, na
turally we were not able to travel to at a -- 
I wasn™t able to go back to Czechoslovakia and to
 my home because of the situation, because of 
the Cold Wa r, and actually the -- my first trip
 back to Czechos lovakia was just about when 
Dub
ek appeared in -- in Czechoslova
kia, and it looked like they 
were a -- going to be able to 
separate themselves from the Soviets, that we ma
de our fi rst trip to Czec
hoslovakia, in -- it was 
in the -- probably ™69 or ™68, during that pe
riod. Was my f -- very first trip back to 
Czechoslovakia. And we were hoping, of course, 
for the -- for the freedom in Czechoslovakia 
and for the Cold Wa r to end. [indecipherable] 

Q: There were several wa rs in the Middle East. Di d they have any special impact on you? 

A: Naturally. Very -- I have some family in -- in
 Israel and ma ny of them
 were participatingin 
the wars and fighting in the wars, and I have lots
 of Israeli friends who 
were involved in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
34 
 
wars. And of course I was extremely involved with, 
emotionally in the -- in the wars in Israel, 
worrying about Israel 
a great deal. But what
 can I say about it? 
Q: Did you follow the Eichma nn trial? 
A: Pardon? 

Q: Did you follow the Eichma nn trial? 

A: Yes, I did. 

Q: Did you feel justice was served? 

A: I don™t know if justice can ever be served, bu
t obviously I was glad that, anyway, that they got 
him and I™ m sorry they didn™t get them all. I 
was hoping that they woul
d find -- I think I often 
thought that ma ybe other people got 
away with -- with things that
 they shouldn™t have and pe -- 
but what did happen [indecipherable] with this 
kind of thing, I mean I just -- I followed the 
Eichma nn trial, I was glad -- I wish they would have gotten others. What can I say about it, it™s 

just horribl e, in any case. I can™t -- 
Q: You were in this country during the Eichma nn trial. 
A: Yes. 

Q: When the trial was covered -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- in the American media, in the press. 
Did you get a sense of how the people around you 
were reacting to the news that was comi ng out of this trial? 

A: The people that -- around me  were the people
 who were feeling the sa
me way as I do. I mean 
-- because, as I told you earlier, 
I didn™t discuss my situation w
ith anybody except people that are 
like myself. And if you think [indecipherable] th
ink about people in my office or outside my 
circle, I wouldn™t have talked about it, in any cas
e. And of course I followed very much myself, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
35 
 
we did as a family. And I -- but I wouldn™t have 
talked a -- about it to 
anyone else, no. So the 
people that I would have been discussing it with 
would have felt the same  way as I do. And I s -- 
and I said before, I hadn™t discussed my situation 
with anyone, so no one talked to me  about it.  
Q: Did you discuss it wi -- you say didn™t discuss 
it with anyone. Did you di
scuss it at all with 
your children? 

A: Of course. Yes, I would have discussed it wi
th my children. Oh, well, fi rst of all, it was 

always a problem, how much do you tell your child
ren?  And we didn™t tell my children too much 
about it. My -- some  of my children an -- knew 
about it more and were much more interested 
than others o -- even th -- I woul
d imagine all the children were in
terested but some  couldn™t talk 
about it as easily as others c
ould. Some , we did talk about it. A
nd if we s pecifically talked about 
the Eichma nn trial to the children, 
I don™t recall. I don™t 
recall about that, but I™m sure that they 
were aware of it. And we did not discuss too mu ch
 -- our children did not 
discuss too much about 
what happened to us. [indeciphera
ble] my mi ddle  daughtercould ne
ver tolerate talking about it. 
She just felt too pained by it.
 I don™t know, I can™t recall it.  
Q: I™m going to pause now -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- and change tape. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: -- to -- to go back to some thing that you had 
said in your earlier in
terview. In your other 
interview you said that you used
 to look at your babies, your child
ren when they were babies and 
feel sorry for them because they were Jewish an
d life would be  hard for them. Do you still feel 
that way?  Ha s life been hard for them because they were Jewish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
36 
 
A: I don™t feel like that any more, not so strongly
, but I still felt sorry slightly for them, because 
it™s not -- it™s not -- it™s hard. When they were l
ittle, I used to stand over 
their crib and I would be 
very, very upset and say what a terrible thing is
 waiting them. They will have to di scover that 
they are Jewi sh -- they will fi nd out they™re Jewi
sh and they™l l discover that  they™re di s -- hated, 
because I felt -- well, when I was a child growin
g up, I was -- I had a lot of this, you know. But I 
don™t feel that way now an -- about my children b
ecause they are adults and they are able to 
handle it, and -- but I some ti me s fe
el slightly sorry for my gra
ndchildren because I feel that 
they™ll find out that it™s not easy to
 be  a Jew, that™s all. But so I 
do -- it™s a little less severe than it 
used to be. When I was a young mot her it was very
 strongly, I felt terrib
le about it, but now it 
isn™t quite like that, it™s much easier. 

Q: You were saying a few mo me
nts ago about what you chose 
to tell your children, when you 
chose to tell your children a
bout your personal experiences. Ha ve
 you shown them some  of the 
letters, and if you have them, journals or a nything from the war years, and letters and 
correspondence with your parents?  Have
 you shared that with your children? 
A: Not really. I -- I don™t tell th
em -- I mean, they know a lot obviously, but -- and I have done a 
tape which I™ ve -- they ha ve listened to. And I™v
e talked to them little 
by little. Not too much 
when they were little, but when they were bi
gger, my mi ddle daughter Kim could hardly ever 
tolerate it. She was terr ibly upset and she neve
r goes to -- she™s never 
been to the Holocaust  
Museum, and she cannot go and see any of the films 
to do with the Holocaust. She™s -- it™s just 
too upsetting for her. But my oldest daughter is 
certainly taking her children to the Holocaust 
Museum, and she knows -- but we don™t talk about it,
 as such. We don™t talk
 about it too much. I 
don™t think the children like to ge
t into the conversation. They fi
nd it very painful. And my son 
also. We  took our son to Czechoslovakia when 
he was eight years old. We  took him to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
37 
 
village -- oh [indecipherable] I took my mi ddle 
daughter to the village, which was a very good 
experience and she™s going to -- in 
fact, going to write an article 
about it for a paper, which I™m 
dying to see, because she just thought it was wonde
rful to be able to -- to ha ve gone back. And 
my older daughter hasn™t had an opportunity, but 
she wanted to go back there. We  wi ll ma ke the 
trip and she will go and see where I was born an
d where her grandparents lived. But the children 
are very -- I didn™t -- when
 I was -- when they were little, I di
dn™t talk to them about it much. But 
of course now, we are [indecipherable] 
Q: Now that you have had children of your ow
n and you know the role of parenting through 
adolescence and into adulthood, can you look back to
 -- to your years in England and -- and in 
this country when you first came and reflect on 
how -- how the fact that you didn™t have your 
parents with you during those formative years had an impact on you? 

A: Well, it had a tr-treme ndous impact
 in that I always felt -- first of
 all, when we left home, our 
mother -- our parent tr -- were very anxious for us 
to s -- be close together
, not to -- to look after 
each other and so we -- I ma de a point always 
of wondering -- of aski
ngmyself how would my 
parents have dealt with this situation?  What 
would they have expected of me ?  How would I 

respond to anything that has come  up in my life.
 And I would always go by what I thought my 
parents would expect of me , which ma y not have b
een the best way, but this is how I ma naged to 
-- first of all I did that to
 -- in respect to -- for my parents, be
cause I felt the responsibility to take 
care of mys -- of myself and my
 sisters -- and my younger sister, 
the way my parents would have 
expected me  to do. And therefore I lived my lif
e like that, which ma y not have been the best 
way. And also, it was difficult because I wanted to
 know -- I always felt th
at I did not learn -- I 
didn™t know exactly how to -- my parents would have
 -- how -- I would have been taught certain 
things when I was growing up, and therefore I wa s 
afraid, I always said 
I wouldn™t know how to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
38 
 
t-teach my children, because I didn™t have an 
example of my parents 
teaching me . And so I 
muddled through it some how. That™s about it. And 
someti mes maybe I didn™t do it -- the greatest 
job, but it worked out the be
st I -- I did the best I coul
d. I did the best I could.  
Q: You me ntioned grandchild
ren. How ma ny grandchildren do
 you have and do they know 
anything about your past? 
A: I have five grandchildren, and hopefully ha
ve [indecipherable] there are two more. I am -- 
yes, they do, the oldest grandchildren, my 12 
year old son -- my grandson knows a great deal. In 
fact he™s very interested and 
asks a lot of questions. And my
 eight year old -- 10 year old 
grandson also knows a great deal. My seven ye
ar old granddaughter is
 too young. And -- but the 
children are very in
terested, and they know a lot. And they
 -- in fact they know more than my 
children knew at that age. And recently I me t a little
 gi rl, an eight year ol d little gi rl who was so 
interested in the war, in what happened to me , 
she said she wa s studying Ki
ndertransport, it is a 
really amazing thing, that little girl from Philade
lphia. And she has read
 all the books about the 
Kindertransport and so -- she was absolutely am
azed when I came  to her grandparents home and 
I told her I was a Kindertransport kid. She was 
really thrilled. And 
so I have been in 
correspondence with her because I think this eight y
ear ol d little gi rl from Philadelphia -- I have  
a letter here, I™ll show it to you 
later -- is the -- our future. 
Q: Has it been easier to talk to your grandchi
ldren than it was to talk to your children? 
A: Yes, I think it is -- grandchild
ren -- yes, it has, actually. In f
act, I ma de a tape for -- not my 
children, but my niece. [indecipherabl
e] my -- I -- there were three of us that came out in the 
Kindertransport. My olde r sist er was 15, I was 
14 and my little sist er was 10. My younger sist er -
- my little sister™s daughter, youngest  daughter, si nce my
 sister died at -- three or  four years ago, 
my -- her daughter wanted to write a book about he
r mother. So I -- she asked me to do a tape 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
39 
 
about my sister™s life. So it™s the first time I act
ually put the thing on tape
. And my grandchildren 
have already heard the tape about my  -- our life 
in Czechoslova kia during -- before the war. So 
they are really interested in their -- also I™m ve
ry pleased about the fact that they want to know. 
Q: Over the years that you worked in Wash
ington, how did your job, 
your professional career 
develop and grow, and how different was it at 
the end of your career than when you first came 
here and started? 
A: We ll, i -- my -- it was one -- first, I had a great
 experience working at the Fund. I -- I did very 
well. I -- I started out as a bilingual secretary 
to a division chief, which I said already, you know, 
a high position. And then I had the opportunity -- we
ll, I learned a lot, of course, on the job, and I 
had the opportunity to do other things 
and to -- I forgot what you asked me. 
Q: I asked you how your job grew
 and developed over the years. 
A: Yes, I -- I™d -- I grew with the job and I coul
d have advanced and I adva
nced as rapidly as I -- 
well, as was possible. And I ma de a perfect care
er and I enjoyed it thor
oughly and I had a great 
working life for 35 years. I could have done othe
r things, I was offered other opportunities in the 
Fund, but I stayed where I was because I enjoye dthe work I was doing. And I felt that was fine 

[indecipherable] have gone -- done more than I ha
d already done. So I felt satisfied with what I 
was doing, and I was pleased with
 the kind of work I did. 
Q: By the time  that you retired, what -- wh
at exactly was your job and what were your 
responsibilitie
s and duties? 
A: I was admi nistrative officer of a departme nt
 and there were about 19 -- roughly 1910 people 
in my departme nt, and I was responsible for hi
ring and staffing the di
fferent divisions. I was 
responsible for travel, for the budget and for whatev
er there wa s to be done in a departme nt that 
was so very vital. And I had a 
very good relationship with my colleagues and loved being there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
40 
 
and I retired nine years earlier than I needed 
to, but I felt that I needed to get on and do 
something else, and I left  the Fund. After I left I 
was consulting for two or three years, on a te -- 
freelance basis, doing budget and doing ot
her things. But it was a good decision. 
Q: You wrote an article for th
e International Moneta
ry Fund ma gazine in January of 1990. How 
did that come about? 
A: It came about because in 1989, I think, there was a 50
th
 anniversary of the Kindertransport 
from London, and it was covered by the ﬁWashingt
on Post.ﬂ And there was an -- an article 

appeared in the ﬁWashington Postﬂ about the meeti
ng and about me . It was the first time that my 
colleagues found out about my life and where I ca
me from and what happened to my family. 
And they asked me  to write an article for the [i
ndecipherable] staff news 
about my experiences, 

about my life, and about the meeting. And that™s
 how it came about, and it was an eye opener to 
everyone that I worked with, because no one 
knew about my situation and no one knew about 

my life story.  
Q: Wow. Would you please tell me about the 
reunion and that whole experience for you? 
A: It was a ma rvelous thing, I™m very grateful to 
the person who arranged 
it. I can™t think of her 
name at the moment, but I will. Do you reme mber 
her name? Okay, later I™ ll think of it, okay? It 
was one of [indecipherable] it was -- I™m glad that 
she or-organized it -- wait a mi nute, I have to 
-- okay, me t a lot of, like, well,
 I didn™t know the people that I came on the -- on the train, 
because we were little and we were from all ove
r the country, but I met the children -- the ki nder 
that were in the chil -- in the children™s home 
with me when we first 
arrived in England. And it 
was wonderful to see them and to be together 
with them aga i n and we 
had another reunion this 
year, this last year, which was 60 years anniversary. And we are in touch with ma ny of the kids 

from those days.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130

Q: Who was  Nicholas Winston, and 
what is so significant -- what 
was so significant about seeing 
him at the 50
th
 reunion and your next visit with him?  
A: Nicholas Wi nton was a young E
nglishma-ma n who organized the 
-- wa -- the Kindertransport 
out of Czechoslovakia. He organized six transpor
ts. Unfortunately only five ma de it, the last 
transpor t di d not make it, all the --  all the childr
en were already on the platfor m in Prague for the 
train to leave, but it wasn™t allowed to leave 
any more. I wa -- I thi
nk I wa s on the one -- on the 
transport which arrived on July first in England. July 1
st
, 1939. And I can tell you exactly how 
ma ny children were on that train if you 
give me  a mo ment. [indecipherable] 
Q: You me ntioned to me  a few mo
ments ago when we weren™t reco
rding that you™re going to be 
seeing him a gain in the next couple of days. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Can you tell me , you know, how this -- this vi
sit is planned for you and how it came  about? 
A: Nicholas Wi nton is now, I thi
nk, 93 years old. And he is visi
ting some  people in -- some  of 
the kinder in Florida, but he wanted to come  a
nd see us because we™ve become  quite close with 
him. And he t-told us that he 
would like to come  and visit us for a couple of days in Washington. 
There™s one other kinder -- kind he
re from Czechoslovakia, from the kinder Czech transports. 
And so he is comi ng to stay with us on the 16
th
 -- is it 16
th
 of January, and spend two nights here. 
And he wants to just sit and relax and take it easy 
and -- with us, that™s all.
 It™s wonderful that he 
wants to do it, we are thr
illed to have him here. 
Q: Are you involved with any Holocaust survivor groups? 

A: Yes, I™m involved with two or three sa --
 different groups. One is the Ki ndertransport 
association. But I think it™s now
 all under one umbrella, it™s 
going to be this year. The 
Kindertransport Association in 
London, the Kindertran
sport Association in America, and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
42 
 
Kindertransport Association of 
the Washington area Kindertranspor
t. That™s three different 
groups. And then [indecipherable] a child surv
ivors™ group, which ma ys
 -- meets once a -- a 
month in Washington, the second Sunday of
 each month. I think that™s about it. 
Q: What do you get out of your a
ssociation with these groups? 
A: That™s a big question. What do I get out of it is
 I like to be -- first of all, whenever we get 
together with any refugees, any people, Eur
opeans, we always end up talking about the 
Holocaust. It never -- it never is di
fferent, it is always thus. It doesn
™t matter what it is, if we are 
together with any of our con -- refugee, or surv
ivors, we always end up talking about it. I have 
ma ny friends, I -- one of my friends
 from the Fund, in fact, the one that I me t on the first day that 
I came to Washington was a child in -- hiding in
 Holland. She was the lawyer [indecipherable]. 
She -- she, of course, knew about my story. And wh
at do I get?  I love to be with them because 
we understand each other, we are soul  ma tes. That™s
 why we have lots of friends who are in the 
same  situation as we are and we have also a 
variety of friends who 
are not. We  have ma ny 
Jewish friends, we have ma ny non-J e wish friends,
 we have ma ny international friends. But we 
always -- we go to these meetings and it™s because I feel comf ortabl e with these people, but I 
also feel -- well, we are differe
nt in ma ny ways, too. But I go there because I feel we belong 
there, some how. What can I say, it™s complicated. 
I could tell you all kind
s of things about it. 
Q: Are you ever asked about your opinion on Madame
 Albright and her -- 
her ha -- her story? 
A: I™m very often asked about it and I™ve read quite
 a lot about it. Fi rst ofall, her cousin, the one 
who lives in Prague was on the Ki
ndertransport like I was, from 
Czechoslovakia. And I think she 
lived with them during the war, in England. And 
I am very oft e n asked about Madeline Albright 
and I cannot believe that she didn™t know about he
r grandparents. That™s my opinion. I think that 
there™s no intelligent -- I 
mean, she™s not -- she™s a very bright
 lady, and she is a 
very intelligent 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
43 
 
lady and she sure must have asked what happene
d to my grandparents, or how would she -- how 
would you not be able to ask the question?  And al
so, what about her cousin, who lost her whole 
fa mily?  She must know that her cousin lost her fa
mily. Where  did she le -- lose her family?  How 
did she lose the family? And -- that
™s all. What can I say about it
? I still think she™s bright and 
able and I respect her,
 but I can™t believe 
that she didn™t know.  
Q: Your husband Peter recently wrote a book. And I s
hould probably me ntion that Peter is also -- 
has also been interviewed by the Holocaust Mu
seum. I™d like you to tell 
me about the book and -
- and how the book has changed your lives. 

A: I™m very, very thrilled that Peter has writte
n the book, because I think it™
s very important that 
he left this docume nt, that he was able to docum
ent what happened and what he did towards -- in 
the war. I™m very, very pr oud of him and I think 
he  did a great job, he™s a great success and ma ny 
people i -- i -- we™ve had enormous a mount of co
rrespondence and praise. And people are -- say 
that it is a very important document and -- and 
very good -- better document than ma ny historical 
histories that were written about Wor l d Wa r II,
 because it™s a personal stor y of some one who 
experienced -- who was -- who lived through this. 
Now, it has changed -- anyway, people wanted 
me to help him type the book, but I told him that
 if he wanted to write a book, he has to do it 

himself. And he actually had a -- a tremendous -- 
I mean, it was a tremendous effort because he 
didn™t know how to type. I said I 
would type it for him if he type
d it up -- if he wrote it up, but I 
wasn™t going to sit at the type
writer while he ma rched up and dow
n in the room dictating to me. 
But -- so he decided to get himself a word proces
sor and he actually did it with his two fingers. 
And he wrote it, which is absolutely incredible
 and I™m really proud of him for having done it. 
And it has changed our lives because he gets --
 he gets correspondence from everywhere and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
44 
 
had found old friends and new friends all over 
the world because of the book. And I think that 
everybody should read it. 

Q: Wa nt to give me  the title of the book? 

A: ﬁStriking Back: A Jewish Commando™s Wa r Agai
nst the Nazisﬂ by Pe ter Masters, Presidio 

press. 

Q: You were telling me  when I was changing ta
pe about a suitcase in Liverpool station. Can you 
tell me  the story? 

A: There is a sculptor in London 
who is doing a suitcase -- a sculpt
ure of a suitcase, which will 
be sort of a -- like a Plexigla
s suitcase and she was asking fo
r donations of Kindertransport, 
because this is where the Kindertransports arri
ve d in London, at Liverpool station. And there™s 
going to be a sculpt ure with a huge Plexiglas suitcas
e and insi de it will be items that the children 
brought with them from Europe. She™s be -- sh
e has been asking for donations, my sister has 
given her quite a few items. I have a few things 
which I mi ght give her, but I™m hesitant because 
I hate to give away some of the things that we
re given to me  by my parents when we left them. 
Course, there are very few things. I have a blanke
t and a ring that my fathe r  bought for me  at the 
station before we left. And I don™t wa nt to part 
with my original photographs and they only want 
to have original photographs. But -- bu
t people are donating quite a few items. 
Q: You™ve mentioned several times 
return trips to Czechoslovakia. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Can you tell me about each time that you 
went and what each experience was like? 
A: The first time I went back was in 1968, I think. C
ould have been a little 
earlier. We arrived in 
-- we planned to go back because at that time  things seem to have eased up in Czechoslovakia 

and we decided that was the time  to go. And it was 
very important for me to ma ke my trip back 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
45 
 
to Czechoslovakia, since I had never been back th
ere. And we arrived in Vienna with plans to 
take a rent-a-car and drive to my village. When 
we got to [i ndecipherable] Peter and myself and 
our son, who was then seven or eight years old, wh
en we arrived in Vienna I suddenly got cold 
feet and I didn't want to go. I said to Peter, no, let™s forget about it, I don™t want to go back. For 
several reasons. First of 
all, I was very afraid of going back 
for the first time. Secondly, I wasn™t 
sure about the pol -- about the communist -- 
what was going -- you know, how it will be . And it 
was just really frightening to me  to go back, 
but Peter said no, we cam
e all this way, we are 
defi nitely going back --  we are defi nitely driving.
 So we rented a car and we drove to my village. 
We arrived in my village at six o™ clock in the ev
ening. It was not recognizable, because it used to 
be a very charmi ng little village in the lower Ta
tras mountains and now it was sort of like a 
factory. A lot of cement buildings
 all around and di -- very dilapi
dated. And we arrived in the 
village at six o™clock in the ev
ening and I didn™t know who to ask for and I didn™t know exactly 
where -- where everything was, it seemed to be 
different. And when we arrived in ce-center of 
the village, I asked -- I decided 
to ask for my gir -- girlfriend,
 who used to be the ma yor™s 
daughter. He r name  was Maria Bautiva She was my
 girlfriend, who was not Jewish. And so we 
stopped in the mi ddle of the village and I said, 
do you know Maria Bautiva?  And they -- I said, 
it™s pr obabl y not her name  any more, because it wa s her name  when she was a little girl. She ma y 

-- she™s probably ma rried and -- but this person 
know -- knew who she was and she said, she died 
two years ago. I was so di sappoint ed because I ha
d not been in touch with her since 1939, but I 
felt she would be the only person I could think of 
that I reme mber. And so then we decided to go 
and look at -- at the house wher
e we lived. And I couldn™t recogni
ze it, it was so run down. The 
entire street was so run down. And at first I di
dn™t know where it was, and I said to him, let™s go 
to the railway station, because from the railwa
y station I know how to find the house. So we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
46 
 
went to the railway station, and walked down the 
street, when there was this hou -- what seemed 
to be our house, which my father finished build
ing in 1938, it was brand new when we left it. We 
left in ™39, my father finished building this h
ouse in ™38. And there were some  children playing 
outside. And said to the children, do you live in th
at house?  And they said yes, we do, we -- three 
fa milies live in the house. We  live on the top floo
r. I -- I said, go and ask you mother whether we 
could come  in, because I used to live here. And 
so she went in, we came to the front of the house 
and the child went in and she ra
n upstairs and she said to he
r mother, somebody wants to come  
and look at the house. And the mother stood at th e top of the stairs, she looked down at us. She 

knocked on the door of the husband™s room wher e he 
was ta -- taking a nap, and she says to her 
husband, come  down, M i ss Eberstark arrives here. 
I was absolutely shocked, I said, how did you 
know who I was?  She said, well who else could it 
be?  Because I said I lived there, so she knew 
exactly in whose house she was living. That wa
s 1939, this wa s 1968, 30 years later. And so we 
went up there and of course I looked -- and 
she said that two families lived downstairs 
[indecipherable] lived upstairs. And they -- a
nd I couldn™t find one st
ick of anything that 
belonged to my parents. There wa
s nothing that was recognizable. And they imme di ately sent for 
other people to come  in. And he was telling u --
 this ma n was  apparently the same  age as we 
were -- I-I wa s, and he said we used to play 
when we were children. And then he said, I 

reme mber your grandfather and he pointed to hi
s [indecipherable] your gr
andfather always used 
to wear this gold watch with a big gold chain. A
nd he made out as if the chain were four i -- 
three inches wide, which was a li
ttle gold chain, but to him that 
chain seemed to be a huge gold 
chain. In any case, it was -- then they insist ed 
that we spend the night. Oh, another person was 
called, and they antic -- we were looking for a pl
ace to st ay for the ni ght and this man insist ed 
that we spend the night at his house, which was 
nice of him. We spend the night there and at 10 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
47 
 
o™clock in the morning I said to Peter, we™ve got 
to get out of here, I can
™t stand being here. And 
we went to a Jewish -- the 
only thing we did was g-go to 
a Jewish cemetery and we -- oh, 
everywhere we went -- I mean that first ni
ght, everybody wanted to buy our house. They said, 
could we buy your house from you?  I said no, it™s
 not my house any mor e . So they s -- and 
anyway, next morning we went to my grandfat
her™s house. And everybody there said also, could 

we buy the house from you?  All these people lived th
ere, all over the place.
 There we re lots of 
people living in the house. 

Q: I™m sorry I have to interrupt you, but
 we™re out of tape. Just one mo me nt. 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Alice Masters. Th
is is tape three, side A. And you were telling me  about your 
visit, your first vi
sit to your home. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And how people were asking you if they 
could buy your house, if they could buy your 
grandfather™s house. 

A: Mm-hm, yes. Th-The next morning -- so we 
ca -- arrive d at six in
 the evening and next 
morning the person who -- at whose house we spent 
the night, wanted us to go to the district 
building, or whatever it is, to find out how mu
ch taxes are due on the house, because he was 
interested in buying it. And reluctantly I went th
ere. And the wome n who was in charge of the 
files, brought out the files and told us about the tax, how muc h 
tax is due and she said to us, to 
me , she would like to buy the house, too. At this point
 I said to Peter, I™ve got to get out of here. 
First of all, I was not negotiating to sell any of th
e houses, but it was -- but I st
ill -- still wanted to 
go to the Jewish cemetery, which we did, we went 
-- which is between two villages. One side of 
the village is the cemetery belongi
ng to our village and the next cem
etery belongs to the village -
- next village. All th
e stones were turned -- knocked down 
and I couldn™t find my grandmother™s 
s-stone and her grave. But we just wa ndered 
around the cemetery, just 
completely overgrown 
and completely demolished. Stones were scattered a
ll over the place. Then I said to Peter, we™ve 
got to get out, I was feeling sick. So at 10 o™cloc
k in the morning -- oh, in the -- then we went to 
the woods, where we used to spend a lot of time 
with the family. And in the woods there was a 
big grave where they -- mass grave where they mu
rdered some  people. I always suspected that 
my grandfather was mur dered there, but I coul
d never find out, and that
™s one thing I did not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
49 
 
really find out who was -- the name s are not on th
e grave, so I don™t know who is buried there. 
Then we saw -- me t one Jew in the village who survived. His fa mily -- I don™t know what 
happened to his family, he didn™t seem to be all 
with it, but he converted and became  a Catholic 
and he™s ma rried to a Catholic woma n. His name
 was Shaima n, I think. And at 10 o™clock in the 
morning we pulled out and I sat in
 the back of the car, Peter and 
our son sat in the --  Peter was 
driving, our son sat next  to him. I sat in the ba
ck because I couldn™t sit 
up, I had to lie down. I 
was sick all the way, all the way to Vienna. I 
was vomiting all the way to Vienna. I was so ill 
that when we arrived at the Czech border, Peter di dn™t see the patrol , the ca -- people trying to 

stop our car, he t -- almost drove
 right through it -- through the fr
ontier. We were almost shot 
because Peter was in such state trying to get me  b
ack to Vienna because I wa s so ill. And then th 
-- [indecipherable] is dark and 
there was lanterns being instal
led [indecipherable] people were 
trying to stop him from driving 
past those lanterns. And he stoppe
d and the guard said, what are 
you trying to do?  You must stop at 
the frontier. And then h-he talk
ed -- he saw me  being very ill 
and he just opened our trunk, examined the trunkand let us go right through. We  arrived in 

Vienna at -- at 11 o™cloc
k at night and I went straight to be
d, it took me  two or three days to 
recover. We  stayed in Vienna and 
I just stayed in the hotel and trie
d to recover from my first visit 
to Czechoslovakia. But, that was a ve ry, very im
portant  visit for my life,
 because that changed a 
lot for me in my life ca -- this vi sit, because for 
years and ye ars, ever since I left home, I just felt 
like I was living from a suitcase, even though I wasma rried and had children. I just felt that there 

was some thing not quite right and that  I ha --  
like I was waiting for something to happen. Well -- 

and I was sort of longing for Czechoslovakia and 
for my home. And having ma de this trip back, 
suddenly it dawned on me  that -- because I was 
-- I always loved snowdrops and wild -- and the 
woods in Czechoslovakia, and having ma de the tr
ip back, I came back home and I said, well, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
50 
 
snowdrops and wild strawberries ar
e not everything. I -- and it sort of
 finished that chapter of my 
past. That was a very, very important time. When 
I came back fr om this trip, it really -- it did 
some thing for my entire being. It ma de me  feel se
ttled, more settled in my home. I felt this is 
where I belong and this is where I am and I 
stopped being so torn towards going home.  
Q: Wa s that your only trip to Czechoslovakia? 
A: No, no. Then we ma de another -- one other trip
 -- well, I went back to Czechoslovakia again, 
to Prague, once. But then my -- my mi ddle daughter
 came , who is a writer
, a journalist, wanted 
to go back, which really surprise
d us. She wanted to go and visit my village. So we decided to 
ma ke a trip back about four years ago. And it wa
s a wonderful, wonderful experience. We  stayed 
also a very short time , but it was wonderful for me  
to be able to take her, to show her where I 
was born, where my parents lived. And we di
dn™t go into the house this time , because nobody 
seemed to be there, but it was very run down. 
And -- but we just walk
ed around. Of course, we 
went to the synagogue which is there, which is
 not a synagogue any longer, it™s me n™s club or 
some thing. It used to be a grain storage after th
e war, when we went back first time . Then we 
went to a Jewish cemetery. Some body seems to be
 taking care of the tomb stones. But one thing I 
did not do, which I still have to do one day when 
I go back, I didn™t talk to anyone in the village. 
I just didn™t feel like I 
could talk to anyone. And I should ha
ve done that, I should have gone to 
the office, to the -- what, a district building, wh
atever they call that, to find out who survived, 
who is there, who is Jewish. I didn™t ask anyone. 
I just didn™t talk to a
nybody, I didn™t feel that I 
wanted to. But we wandered around the village,
 we went to the -- passed the synagogue, 
everybody was staring at us because we were
 looking up and down whe r e the synagogue stood. 
Then we asked the taxi driver to drive us to 
the Jewish cemetery. We  went and took photos and 
movies of the Jewish ceme tery. Then we went 
to stop at the schools to which I went, and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
51 
 
daughter just adored it all and thought it was ma rvel
ous to have been -- made the trip. Now we 
have to take the -- my oldest daughter. 

Q: Are you planning on any more trips? 

A: Yes, we want to go with my older daughter to
 s -- to do the same thing, because all the -- my 
yo -- son saw the village, he was only seven or ei
ght year s old, but -- so he  would be willing to 
go again. But my oldest daughter has never been a
nd she absolutely wants 
to see it, so one of 
these days when -- ma ybe even a year or two, we™ll go again. 

Q: Was it your mi ddle daughter w
ho was always very sensitive to
 stories about the Holocaust?   
A: Yes, it™s my mi ddle daughter who was very -- 
has go -- been to a [indecipherable] get a badge 
of [indecipherable] when she was very young she 
wrote a poem about her grandparents and she -
- she™s the one who went. She™s going to write ab
out it, which will be quite exciting because I™ m 
waiting to see that articl e. 

Q: Is there anything that we
 have not discussed that you 
still want to talk about? 
A: I think we ™ve covered more or less everything 
except, let™s see -- well, 
I think -- I can™t think 
of -- probably after we finish I™ll 
think of lots of other things th
at I haven™t said, because that 
happened when I did the original tape. After it 
wa s done, I thought of ma ny 
things that I should 
have me ntioned. Mm, well, yes, there are severa
l things that I haven™
t mentioned. I haven™t 
me ntioned my uncle, who was instrume ntal in br
inging us out. My uncle, who was my mother™s 
youngest brother, who lived in lon -- London. First 
he lived in Berlin and so he knew what was 
going on and then he lived in London and he™s the 
one who ma de the arrangeme nts for us to -- to 
come out. Now, it was absolutely a mi racle that  
we came out because we lived in a small village 
in the Tatra mountains, where no one would have 
ever imagined that anything would happen to 
us. And we always thought, duri
ng the war, that nothing would ha
ppen to my parents because we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
52 
 
thought our friends, our 
neighbors would take care of them. But we were wrong. Now, if it 
hadn™t been for my uncle and his wife, Lotte, we
 would -- who urged our 
parents, if it hadn™t 
been for my brave parents who took it upon them
selves to put three children on a train -- my 
God, when I think about it -- and to give up the children and to send them away, and if hadn™t 
been for Nicholas Wi nton, and if it had -- hadn™t 
been for my guardian who signed for me , and if 
it hadn™t been for Marda Hess who signed for my  ol
dest sister and my you
ngest sister, we would 
never have ma de it. And also I want
 to say that -- that if I had to
 say anything critical about it, is 
that nobody paid attention to our education. I mu st
 say that, because in London my older sister 

was left totally without schooling. She was 
15 years old and nobody thought of sending her to 
school. And is -- I think that is ab
solutely awful, that is, when 
I think about it. 
And with me  it 
was a mi racle that my guardian -- I mean, my 
unc le persuaded my guardian to send me  to 
secretarial school. That was a bi
g argume nt, she didn't want to 
do it because she kept on saying 
that she only was required to sign, not to do a -- do
 anything because she -- he promised her that 
she wouldn™t have to do anything but sign for me
. And now he was asking her to send me  to 
school, and I had to finish my schooling in 10 
mo nths where other children went to that 
particular school for three years to
 get the -- or two years, or th
ree years to get the schooling. I 
had to do it in 10 months, which was not -- no
t good because I didn™t speak English. I had to 
learn to speak -- take shorthand, it was very difficult.
 But that is really a 
shame that no one really 
paid much attention, I guess. Everybody was 
so stressed and preoccupied and under such 
difficulties that nobody thought about it. I mean -- I 
don™t know. It seems to me that they could 
have seen to it that my older sister had some  scho
oling, and that I was sent 
to a better school than 
I did -- was, but still, we -- we™r
e grateful that we survived and we
 are grateful that all of these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
53 
 
people participated, my uncle, the guardians, 
my parents, Ni cholas Wi nton, who else?  A-And 
everybody. It worked for -- for us. 
Q: I™m not sure you me ntioned on this tape 
the name  of your guardian. Would you please 

mention her name?  

A: Yes, her name  was Fanny Bandit. She was a sp
inster lady. She was well-to-do. She had a big 
fa mily, she was Jewish. But she just didn™t know 
what to do with me . You know, she just signed 

for me . She felt that -- she was -- happened to be a 
friend of my uncle™s, so sh -- but -- that™s why 
she signed. But she -- although she could have afford
ed to do a lot of things, she just didn™t know 
how to deal with it. Didn™t do anything. But we
 were -- she became a close friend and she was 
always -- to the end she was very proud of the f
act that she did this, and she was very proud of 

me  because she thought I did so well. 

Q: In your years in the United States, di
d you ever experience any anti-Semitism?  
A: Yes, I did. In my offi ce, actua lly there was a gi
rl that was -- when I fi
rst arrived, she used to 
make very antiseti -- anti-Semitic remarks. 
That was the only time I really experienced 
some thing -- oh yes, well that was one, and I di
dn™t say anything to her,
 I never said anything. I 
didn™t want to get into a debate with her. And 
then one day she got really angry with me . She 
said -- she blamed me . She said, why did you al
low me  to say these things. And she got angry 
with me, she blamed me for not le
tting her know that I was Jewish. 
And wi -- a-after that it was -
- never ever it was said, and she was okay. But sh
e used to make anti-Semitic remarks all the 
time at the beginning, when we first met. And 
of course, I experienced anti-Semitism because 

when we used to go to the beach, to eastern s
hore, I saw signs saying, no Jews allowed. No Jews 
or, Gentiles only. No Jews or 
dogs allowed, or some thing. I saw 
that, it was very disturbing to 
me , and very, very shocking and surprising. I did 
si -- experience a little
 bit like that, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
54 
 
otherwise, I wa -- no. Oh yes, there was a ma n that
 I was in a carpool with when I worked at the 
Fund, I won™t me n -- me ntion his name . He always us
ed to make jokes, and he said to me , the 
only mi stake Hitler made -- he used to say these th
ings, but he said that he didn't finish the job. 
He was [indecipherable] 
Q: When you look back on your life 
in the United States, what was 
the best surprise about life 
here?  

A: The best surprise? Well, lots of
 -- I love being here
. I -- the best surprise was the fact that I 
felt at home here. I -- it™s -- it™s amazing. I mean, I 
was very -- absolutely astonished when I first 
arrived, how much at home I felt, almost immedi
ately. Very comfortable,
 and I never felt like a 
foreigner here. I felt very good and I also find -- I™m
 always, to this day I™m just thrilled about 
ma ny things. First of all, ever
y single day when I get up I™m thrilled about my house and 
[indecipherable]. Then I™m thrilled and I just am
 a s tonished about the abundance of everything 
everywhere. And I™m jus t  amazed about it. Course I have neve r overcome  -- when I go to the 
store -- and I think this is a syndr
ome of ma ny refugees, I always f
eel -- I always feel that if I 
don™t buy two of everything, it won™t be there the 
next day. You know, it™s 
peculiar, I -- I keep 
on telling myself it will be there, 
I don™t need to buy two thi -- item
s at the same time. But I still 
have this thing left over from -- from years 
ago, you know, when we didn™t have anything in 
England because we had so little. I -- everyt
hing, nothing, you know, whe n we first -- when we 
were refugees, we lived in th
e children™s home for thirt -- to 
start with, and we had six -- 
sixpence pocket money a week, six pence. And most
 of it went for [indecipherable] to ride home. 
Then I ma na ged to save about 15 shillings. And 
then when we were split up -- when the war 
started we were split up, my little
 sister had to go to another ro
om -- to anot her pl ace. We were 
all split up, the three of us. And so I gave my 15 
s hillings to my little sister, because I always 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
55 
 
said, I can always take care of myself, but she wi
ll need -- be we had so little, we had nothing. I 
mean, we had so little money a
nd so little -- but, it was fi
ne. You know, we ma naged. It™s 
amazing how [indecipherable] ma nage, you know
, with nothing. But here I felt very 
comfortable, or [indecipherable] 
Q: Continue. 

A: Yeah, very comfortable, very much at hom
e and there was never a
ny question that I would 
want to be anywhere else.  

Q: So let™s pause, we have a disturbance here
. [tape break] Okay, we™re back, sorry about that, 
there was some one at your door. My last question
 to you, okay?  What is yet in store for you and 

what would you yet like to accomplish? 

A: What is yet in store? Well, I™m curious abou
t that myself. What would I like to acco mplish?  
I™d like to see that my kids are happy, that my 
children -- I mean, this is very difficult question. 
What would I like to accomplish?  It™s -- well,I keep on toying with 
the idea whether I should 
join a synagogue, that™s one thi
ng. I reject it every time, but I 
lean more towards it someti mes. 
And with what I™d like to accomplish, I™d like to clean up my house and sort out my papers and 

throw out the things I don™t need any longer and 
leave my house in order for my kids. That™s 
what I™d like to accomplish. That™s it. And I hope 
that we stay well and that my husband stays 
healthy. 

Q: Have you ever been to Israel? 

A: Yes. 

Q: I did not know that. Could you te
ll me  a little bit about the trip and -- and what it was like for 
you, and that will be  my last question. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0130  
56 
 
A: We ll, we went to Israel a few -- a few years 
ago. I™d like to go more 
often. I often te -- we 
have some  cousins in Israel that I have f
ound through Yad Vashem, one cousin. And we went 
there once with the World Jewish Congress, andit was very emotional and very moving and I 
cried when we arrived in Jerusalem.  It was w
onderful and I™d like to go again, but we  haven™t 
done it. But I have -- I™m thrilled with Israel, I™
m deli -- I -- I™m -- I hope it
 prospers and survives 
and [indecipherable] with peace. And I -- 
Israel is very close to my heart. 
Q: Thank you for speaking with me  today. 

A: Okay.
