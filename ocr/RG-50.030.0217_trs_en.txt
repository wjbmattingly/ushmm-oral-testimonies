STANISLAW SOSZYNSKI 
 October 6, 1989 
 
Q:You can speak now. We are recording. 
 

A:Yes. My name  is Stanislaw Soszynski. I was born on February 24, 1931, in Wa rsaw. I lived in 
Old Town through my whole childhood. This is
 the oldest part of Wa rsaw, mostly 
inhabited by the poor, craftsme n, me rchant
s. A very diverse population, forming the 
northern part of Wa rsaw. The neighborhood 
was inhabited by ma ny, even very ma ny, 
Jewish families. In our building, at 11 Fret St
reet, there lived five Je
wish families, out of 
twenty-odd total in the building. Our relations we
re those of neighbors, that is apartme nts 
were not locked, theft was unknown. Nowadays 
the full symb iosis that existed in those 
crowded, packed buildings is forgotten. Ther
e we re of course disturbances in this 
symbiosis. There had to be. Whenever peopleare crowded into a mall space, the conflicts 

of their interests lead to occasional st rife. 
That peaceful life, that life of storekeepers, 
tradesme n, craftsme n, mi nor civil servants, was interrupt ed by the war. There was an 

imme nse ma rket hall near the st reet that I liv
ed on. It was on Swietojerska Street. It was 
split in half, and fi sh were sold on one side, while vegetabl es, fr uits, and da iry products 

were sold on the other. That ma rket hall 
will be very important 
to the lives of many 
people during the war. Firstly, food will be  se
nt through it, for it stood on the line that 
was designated by the Germans as the border of
 the ghetto. La ter, in the years of the 
defense of Old Town, that hall will be tr
ansforme d into a huge hospital. Although it is 
impossible to change a fish ma rket or a pr
oduce ma rket into a hospital, that was how it 

was, regardless. The siege of Wa rsaw in 
1939 was a great drama. The Germans, having 
broken the resistance of the Polish army we
st of the Vistula, surrounded Warsaw. The 
city was full of historic architectural 
artifacts and monume nt
s. Al most 700 antique 
buildings we re so ravaged by the war that they
 had to be built prac
tically all over again. 
Besides, the 1.5 million enclosed people of 
the city defended itself desperately, led by 
President Stefan Starzynski. The defenders c
onsisted partly of me mbers of the Jewish 
population. President Starzynski, the defender 
of Warsaw in 1939, appointed Czerniakow 
as his co-worker representi
ng the Jewish population, the Je
wi sh society.   When the 
Germans entered Warsaw, a de molished Warsaw
 covered in snow, in which the walls 
smelled scorched. I lived through one of the 
most difficult times in my life. We were 
going on Wi erzbowa Street to Marshall Jozef P
ilsudski Square to visit my aunt, passing 

the burned buildings of Theater Square, when on
 the other side of the street I saw a ma n 
who appeared to be drunk. I was with my fath
er and my siblings. He was stumbling from 
the sides of the houses to the 
curb and weaving across the widt
h of the sidewalk. At last 
he fell down. Father said that we should keep
 going down the side of the street that we 
were on, but he crossed the street and appr oached the ma n.  He  picked him up, and now 

others came  up. Together they sat him on a wall. I saw that my father lifted up the ma n's 

trouser leg and bound the ma n's leg with his ha
ndkerchief. He kept 
going down the street, 
parallel to us.  When we  came out onto the sq
uare, I noticed that Z-shaped anti-aircraft 

ditches had been dug into the grass of the s
quare. There were some people filling them in 

while a German sentry watched over them.  The soldier wore a helmet and carried a 

carbine with an affixed bayonet. Father went 
up to him and looked at him.  He came back 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217

and said "That thug ran his bayonet through that
 man's leg."  I could not understand how 
someone could simply bayonet someone's leg lik
e that, on the street 
in broad daylight, 
simply because he was not filling a ditch fast
 enough, or, as it later turned out, because he 

was a Jew.  It was an inexplicable situation, 
but I realized then that
 a time had come when 
law went against common sense... these ar
e complex ma tters, I 
cannot explain, but I 
realized that invaders, Ge rmans, bad people had come .  
 

Q:You were eight years old then. 

 

A:I was then eight years old, yes.  A comm
on life of poverty commenced.  The city was 
destroyed, there was no running 
water, no light, no food.  Wa
ter was carried from the 
river.  Because wome n did the laundry in th
eir homes, every home had a big kettle for 
doing the wa sh.  The me n stood in a row and toge ther took all of the pots.  They went in 

long strings to the Vistula, ta
king streets that sloped down to
 the river.  They nailed 
together boards and put them over the water they
 collected so that it 
would not splash out. 
These problems ce me nt ed people all the more; nothing unites like mi sfortune.  Joy may 

split, while mi sery draws people together. This
 is the second scene that I reme mber, and 

it also is as if from a gha stly dream. 
 German patrols began appearing in our 

neighborhood dressed in what 
were known before the war as anti- _____ [102] suits.  
They were ma de out of a watertight, prepared
 fabric.  On their backs they carried tanks 
and in their hands they had nozzles such 
as are today used to
 apply lacquer under 
pressure.  There was some  kind of poison in t
hose tanks, phenol or car
bolic acid or some  
other liquid that destroyed ever
yt hing that it came into cont act with. It  turned out that  

these patrols dema nded money from owners of 
Jewish stores.  If the extortion money was 
not paid, the Germans would hose down the inside of the store with the carbolic acid. 

There was a jeweler in the next 
building to us.   He had a tiny 
store, so small that the door 
simultaneously served as the 
display.  There was a counter 
inside, while the precious 
things he put on display were hung on an ingeni
ous little shelf in the door.  I stood before 

the door when the Germans came up and dema nded
 payment - he did not have it.  Within 
a few mi nutes, the st ore had been soaked with th
at stinking carbolic acid.  To this day, I 
get a feeling of grimness whenever I enter 
a newly disinfected room, bec a use I see a ma n 
with that destructive nozzle in his hand. Ther
e was no talk of a ghetto at the beginning. 
At first it was even said that the Jews woul
d be in a better situa
tion than the Poles under 
the occupation because they would be able 
to understand what the Germans were sayi ng. 
The lion's share of the Jewish people unders
tood German. Thi s turned out to be an 
illusi on. The winter of 1939-1940 was bitterly co
ld. The frost was so strong that it split 
open trees. On New Town Squa
re, there stood a dozen trees at
 the base of which was a 
temporary cemetery. In the mi ddle stood a statue
 of the patron of 
Wa rsaw, and the trees 
broke up so that limbs were falling down on 
the graves. During that winter I wore my 
scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat. I was standi ng in 
the gate when one of
 my friends ran out 
bare-headed.  
 

Q:One of your Jewish friends? 

 

A:Yes, one of my Jewis h friends. I motioned to
 him with my  chin, to
 ask "Hey, have you gone 
crazy?  You should put some thing 
on your head."  He motioned 
with his head at a German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217

patrol standing at a narrowing in the street 
to which all the passing Jews had to bow. He 
did not have a cap so that he would not have
 to bow, in that horrible cold. I looked at 
him, he was three or four years older than 
me , and I felt the strange
ness of the situation. 
Then talk began that there would be a ghetto, 
that all the nationalities in Warsaw would 
be put into their own zones.  No one said
 that there would be 
a Jewish section, an 
extermination section. I think that the preci
sion with which that society wa s destroyed 
was the result of great thought - psychological thought, orga
nizational thought. I think 
that it must have been done by people who 
knew mob psychology. It is not so simple to 
collect three or four hundred thousand peopl
e in one place without telling them about 
one's goal, one's purpose. The first step was simp
ly lying:  that is, it was said that  Warsaw 
would be split into sectio
ns. There would be an assigned Aryan section, a German 
section, a Jewish section. The Jewish secti
on was relatively speaking huge, very large in 
this first phase.  These sections were to 
be inhabited exclusively by those assigned to 
them. The psychological groundwork for this division was laid by posting on streetcar 

posts and street lanterns signs
 that said "Jews Are Forbidden To Wa lk On This Side Of 
The Street." Suddenly, a part 
of the street was off-limits, like stores, like parks, and 
similar places in the city. A
nother form of preparation was 
that the Germans placed signs 
on the roads that instructed drivers to dr
ive past  very quickly because the area was 

infected with typhus.    Finally, small wall
s sprang up. The people of Wa rsaw, especially 
the people of Old Town, the oldest neighborhood
, were hot-headed, and if walls were put 
up against their will, th
en they took them down. At firs
t those walls were taken part. 
Someone needed some bricks, and so on. It tu
rned out that this was another ploy: it was 
said that the walls would 
for m checkpoints where the police could check passer-by's 
identification, but in reality it was announced
 that the neighborhood was closed, and that 
people who were forced to wear armbands with 
the Star of David had to go there. Tens of 
thousands of people living in that
 zone had to be moved, however.  
 

Q:Your house was not in the zone? 

 

A:Our house was on the border of the ghetto. 

 

Q:So it was still on the Aryan side? 

 

A:The back of the house was in the ghetto. But 
our part, the fr ont of the house, where our 
apartment was, was on the Aryan side . This la
ter led to an unexpected result: the great 
smuggling operation that began when the ghett
o was closed. For example, people would 
pour milk down the drain-pipes to the ghetto 
part. But now I am speaking about the point 

when tens of thousands of people were leav
ing the ghetto and tens of thousands were 
moving in. Because time was very short, 
the people who had property there had to 
quickly sell everything in an effort to save
 some thing. Those people were pauperized. So 
a great ghetto was created, containing 300,000 
people. Today, when one looks at a map 
and knows the outcome  of it all, 
one can see that the line of 
the ghetto was very carefully 
drawn so as to leave all large parks outside.
 No large area of gree
nery, no square that 
could give some  respite to 
the children there, not to me
ntion the adults. One of the 
surprising, shocking facts that I 
have learned is the story of 
the teacher in the ghetto who 
asked the children to draw su
mmer. It turned out that th
e children did not know what it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217  
4 
 
looks like. Four and five year-old childre
n who had grown up behind the walls could not; 
draw a horse, cows, sheep they did not even know what those things were . Families left  
our house in tears. Superintendent Bomoski 
[ph -220], a simp le ma n, helped them load 
what they had - they were not rich people. In
 any case, we said that
 sooner or later the 
war would end, that we would surely see each 
ot her again. Unfortunately this was not to 
be. Those walls were the battle-ground of a 
contest between the lead
ership of the ghetto, 
the people of the ghetto, and the Germans. 
Because by means of those walls, attention 
was turned away from the basic facts. If one
 day it was announced that Zlota, Hoza, or 
Sienna, or a part of a building was no longer 
in the ghetto or else was now included in the 
ghetto, it seemed as if directing energies to
ward "defense" was the most important thing. 

In reality, this was not the case. Hunger be
gan there. Rations were
 purposely reduced so 
that hunger began.     Small boys who could 
get through the holes knocked in the walls of 

the ghetto went through. Among others, two boys
 from our building came. They sat on a 
stump. All of the houses in that old part of
 town, since the only heat was from coal 
stoves, had large stumps in the courtyard 
for chopping wood. They sat on that stump, we 
all ran up. They sad that it was hard, that some  
of their parents were in poor health, that 
they came because they had nowhere to go a
nd they knew they had friends here, and so 

on. The adults gave them, I had nothing of c
ourse, what they had, some  pieces of bacon, 
bags of flour.  I ma de an appointme nt to 
see them.  Because the streetcar went through 
the streets of the ghetto to Powzazki, there 
was no other way for the streetcar to go, one 
could board on the Aryan side and ride th
rough.  Although a policeman guarded the car, 

it was possible to jump out, at first, when the 
streetcar still operated 
as it did before the 
war.  I suddenly found myself in a city that
 is hard to imagine. Thousands of people 
walked back and forth, apparently with no pur
pose.  Peddlers ran around 
with their carts.  
Some one was selling bread, which he kept in a 
basket ma de of barbed wire, so that no 
one could take it without paying.  All of thiswas so unbelievable that even now that I am 
an adult, an old ma n, an artist, whenever I 
try to represent it gr
aphically I look at my 
work and think that it is comple
te]y surrealistic.Br
ead bundled in barbed 
wire is inedible.  
One cannot even begin to share those peoples 
experience.  I found th
e boys: it turned out 
that they lived with ten othe
r people in one room.  Sanitary problems began imme diately.  
Today, in a world in which everything wo
rks without disruption, we do not understand 
what it means, twelve people in one room.  
Not in one apartment, in one room.  Now, 
suddenly that one small water closet intended for 
the use of a fa mily of four or five must 
function as a street lavatory.  An unbelievable 
thing started to happen. 
 I cannot talk about 
people dying.  I know it now, but 
I did not see it then.  But there were dead bodies laying 
on the side walks.  
 

Q:In the street or on the side? 

 

A:Everywhere!  Today it is known that; on Krochm
alna Street there was 
a building in which, out 
of four hundred inhabitants, four hundred died
!  A whole apartment building died, a huge 
apartment building with four hundred people. 
After some  time, the ghetto was sealed off 
completely.  One could not go in without a sp
ecial pass, and even with a pass... the story 
went around Wa rsaw that a Polish doctor, on 
the so-called Aryan side, whom a Jewish 
doctor called because he had a serious case, we
nt into the ghetto with a pass. The Gestapo 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217  
5 
 
followed him and killed everyone, the patient and both of the doctors.  That information 
went around the whole city.  
 

A:Was it true? 

 

A:Yes! Of course.  Today, after 
the war, the name s of those people have been established, and it 
is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of 

extermination carries with it.  Because  the walls of the ghetto moved as those people 

were crowded even more, and we lived close 
by, I had an experience 
that I already told 
you about that is I sold milk. This was neces
sary because my father fell ill and could no 

longer support the household.  Th
ere were three of us then, 
my mother.  I was twelve 
years old then.  I took a milk can and went outsi
de of town to a farmer who would sell me  
twelve liters. I was scared while transporti
ng it, because the so-called "sentries" st ood 

guard at all of the train stations. This 
was often quite dramatic: a German gendarme 
called "Pretty Boy, " because he had a very 
pretty appearance, an ideally smooth face, 
clean-shaven, a pretty boy, came into th
e compartment and started looking for 
contraband. Meat, butter, whatever ma de 
hi m happy.  I was sitting on my milk can 
between the seats next to the window. There was another milk can up on the luggage 

rack, which its owner, another ma n, had opene
d so that it would not go sour. The German 

seized the can by the handle, not knowing that
 it was open. The milk poured all over him. 
Everyone began to laugh, he asked politely whos
e can it was. The ma n ne xt to me  said 
that it was his. He opened his holster and s hot him, right in that train. Within a few 

seconds, the ma n was dead. I brought the milk 
home. That da y I also
 brought; a bottle of 
honey home , for us. I was supposed to go visit 
a friend who lived next to the ghetto wall. 
I poured some  honey on a piece of very ba
d bread, which reportedl y was ma de of 

sawdust mi xed with flour, bread which was 
rationed to us. I took my bread and honey 
and went down the street eating it. I got too th
e street where the ghetto wall was, when a 
"szaulis, " a soldier working for the Germ
ans, standing by the wall in an ash-grey 
uniform with black cuffs and a long cartridgebelt motioned to me . I was convinced that I 

had died because I imme diately thought that I 
was just as scruffy and disheveled as those 
boys who sneaked out of the ghetto in search of
 food, and that he had taken me  for one of 
those boys. That was the longest walk of my 
life. I went up to him and wa ited for him to 
turn his gun on me and shoot. It turned out th
at he  needed my  piece of bread with honey. 

He twisted my arm, took it and put it in his mouth. Then he waved me  off, " Weg."  

Comi ng back, I knew that I was alive, but at 
the same  ti me  I realized... ma ybe for a few 
mi nutes I was a Jewish boy - that there wa
s no law there, that this was a horrible 
lawlessness. At one point a rumor went ar
ound Warsaw that Jews were being deported. 
No one knew how, but the word "Ums chlagplat
z " entered the vocabularies of the people 
of Wa rsaw. Of course the te
rror inflicted on the people of
 Warsaw was so strong, people 
were shot on the street, stopped, rounded 
up and sent to camps , whole neighborhoods 
were surrounded where thousands of me n woul
d be asked for identification and put in 
cars known as "boxes, " that all 
of these terrible rumors fell 
on different ears then we 
have today, as I speak. When one sees dead 
people on the street, one reacts differently 

than to a ma n killed in a car accident . Bu
t all the same these were horribl e matters, 
exceeding the imagination.  I had anot her expe
rience that was unique. It turned out that 
there was no hope for my father. He is very si
ck, so sick that he must die. We were all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217  
6 
 
aware of this, but a person wants to... a person 
clings to his hopes. Father was put in a 
hospital which had been a special
ist hospital before the war. The hospital was located in a 
T-shaped area that was cut out of the ghetto, bu
t inside the ghetto.  To go in, one had to 
pass a guard, go along a few buildings which 
belonged to the ghetto, and there was the 
hospital building that was separate.  This
 was a hospital by name  only - there was no 
proper food there, no beds, nothing.  There were
 beds, but again in name  only -- normal, 
iron beds, not hospital beds.  As a result I carried
 part of the food we were able to obtain 
to the hospi tal every day.  I carried a can 
with a spoon and by the Arsenal, because the 
wall went along Przejazd Street, it wa s complete
ly empty.  Evidently there had just been 
a round-up or some  shooting or... anyway, I sa
w the Wa cht mann in the ghetto gate from 
a long way away.  He mi xed up the soup to ma ke  sure there were no weapons or 

ammunition in it and let me pass. As I walked
 by those walls, peopl
e appeared who were 
fixated by the sight of my can.  I saw this, I fe
lt it.  They could not cross the wall, but at 
the same time it was a horribl e feeling of an i
ndescribable hunger. That wa s how I took it.  
A few months later, the Ghetto Uprising be
gan.  From what I reme mber, it was not the 
fight that it is described as
 today, a band of desperate pe
ople shooting and so on. Because 
we lived nearby, I saw it. It was a militarily 
well-organized de fense of parts of buildings. 
I do not know how the battle looked in the 
rest of the area, bu
t along Swietojerska, 
Bonifraterska, and Franciszkanska Streets, 
within our sight, wa s fought in an exemplary 
way.  So well that snipers, placed in high point
s in those buildings, for a few days did not 
even allow the German s oldiers and divisions 
to enter that wa y.  It was not until heavy 
artillery, with multiple ba rrels, was br ought in, 
and houses were subjected to direct fire - 
they would fire at a spot several time s, the 
wall would collapse revealing an apartment, 
and they would move on to the next house, 
they were me thodically destroying house after 
house - that the defenders retreated. Anot
her shocking me thod, one that the Germans 
would use massively during the Wa rsaw Upri
sing of 1944, we re fires.  The Germans 
would set fire to whole blocks of houses.  
So that northern part of the city had an 
enormous column of smoke over it.  Because they would not let the fire department in 

and there was no access to that 
section of the city, those houses burned until they burned 
out.  They then began to demolish those houses.  
 

Q:After the Uprising? 

 

A:After the Ghetto Uprising.  No one was allo
we d in.  The Germans put up signs saying that 
they would shoot without warning at anyone found 
in that area.  It turned out that this 
was all part of their plans;
 in 1939, the architect Pabst had drawn up a plan for the 

destructionof Wa rsaw.  That nor
thern part of the c
ity was to be leveled with the ground.   
No one knew that then except for people like
 Professor Zachwatowicz, who was able to 
get to the documents dealing with Pabst in the town hall.  Now, filled with horror and 

surprise, we watched as a great city of a million and a half people and covering several 

square kilome ters was turned to desert, co
mpletely leveled. Everyt
hing of any value was 
taken out: pipes, balconies, roofing, upholster
y, and so on, and then the buildings we re 
blown up.  The houses were mi ned and blown up.  In 1944, when the Wa rsaw Uprising 

broke out, the northern part of the city that
 the Germans had designated to be the ghetto 
was a flat plain.  The partisans who went to 
attack the German divisions in the cemeteries 
discovered that there was no possibility of 
cover, because on an open field like that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0217

heavy machine guns can stop anything.  This is ve
ry hard to describe in just a few words, 
those years, 39 to 45.  If one goes to that pa
rt of Warsaw today, one can still see how it 
was. Every time  a cable is laid, everytime a 
shovel touches the earth there, remi nders of 
that city, that life, come  up.  I wanted 
to understand why it happened, why those people 
were destroyed, why that city was destroyed.  
I looked for some  sort of memory of those 
people.  I dug up the strangest 
things there. Some  of them 
I could not pick up, or, feeling 
their gravity, I decide d that I had no place worthy to hold them.  For example, once a 
bulldozer pushed aside a huge block of bric
ks, under which lay se
veral hundred trouser 
and vest buckles, which evidently had been in
 a bag or a box that had decayed.  Oxidized 
buckles.  Because they had been there, cr
ushed, for a long time , they had for med a 
cluster, a sculpture.  I looked at it and thought
 that this was a kind of summation of what 
had happened there.  There must have been 
a sickly tailor there who was suddenly told 
that he had to leave everything.  Of course, 
the buckles were the most important thing to 
him, because that was his shop.  He hid them
 down there in the baseme nt.  They took his 
live away, and the buckles lay there.  An
 object, a tiny object, can say more about a 
drama like this than a hundred words.  That fl
at plain was petrifying to the city.  It ma de 
it clear that life is stronger
 than that... that... demonic destruction.  That wa s not human 
destruction, it was some how devilish.  The know
ledge that some day this would all be 
grown over, trees would sprout, neighborhoods
, children who did not even know what 
had happened would be playing, it would be anot
her city for them.  I tried to reme mbe r  
and cement in my me mor y what had happened 
from this angle and I collected fragme nts 
of that city and of that life.  Some times 
the images I saw wandering in the ruins were 

surrealistic.  I think th
at I have told about th
is already. I once saw th
at bricks were flying 
into the air on that flat plain. They would ju
mp up.  A brick would leap into the air and 
fall down again.  There were whole fields of
 jumping bricks.  I could not understand, I 
thought that I was starting to see things, for how do bricks 
jump?   But I put aside my 
concern and went closer to where the bricks
 were flying. I now saw 
with great surprise 
that that Teutonic fury had de
stroyed everything on the surf
ace, but that down below the 
funda me nt rema ined, and they contained good, h
ealthy brick.  So the local carters earned 
money by clinging holes down to the funda me nt
, throwing the bricks up to the surface, 
and selling them to people who were building. 
 It was very simple 
and logical, there was 
nothing extraordinary about it.  All the same , th
at was how life began to creep back into 
that area. Spontaneously, in the general re
building of Warsaw, it 
began by taking out the 
bricks, restoring order.  The 
bricks were put in piles, th
e area was cleaned, the Muranow 
resident ial di strict was built, pa rtly on land that ha d been part of the Jewish section. The 

city began to expand as far as the cemeteries th
at  are st ill ther e today.  It turned out that 
this was a kind of holy place. Today it is ve ry di fficult to build some thing in Wa rsaw 

without disturbing the peace of the murdere
d.  A bulldozer scooping up earth to build a 
funda me nt brings up huma n bones, ma ss graves are found in completely unexpected 

places.  Every time a new urban building site is
 being chosen, history must be examined 
to ensure that the pl ace is not one of martyrdom.  
 

Q:And later the whole city was 
destroyed thus, all of Wa rsaw? 
 

A:The Uprising?

Q:You did not tell us your e
xperiences during the Uprising. 
 
A:That is because I did not know that: it was a su
bject of our conversation.  A year after the 
events in the Ghetto, Wa rsaw rose to do battle. 
 As it turned out, that what they had done 
in one district, they now expanded onto a scal e of the whole city.  My beloved Old Town, 

in which I gr ew up, and which was the place on 
earth to which I belonged, as everyone 
should have such a place, was leveled just as 
the ghetto was. It is very hard to understand 
the words "Your house has burned down."  They are only five words, but it is very 

difficult.  When we went out, it was also very 
surrealistic.  I kept fish.  I always liked 
animals, birds, plants.  I ma de myself an a
quarium and kept fish.  I had already had one 
sad experience: windows had to be completely bl
acked-out, so that no li
ght at all got out, 
and it was wi nter. Upon opening the curtain one
 morning, I saw that the aquarium had 
frozen.  It was so cold in the apartment that t
hose poor fish were frozen still in the ice.  It 
is now September 2, 1944, the end of the defense 
of Old Town.  We  are to come  out with 
our hands up.  I run into the apartment and 
there is the aquarium. 
I know that soon there 
will be a gr eat fi re here, and that the aquarium 
will shatter, and that that little bit of water 
has no chance of putting the fi re out.  The apartment is a place to which one comes back, 

to which one comes with the feeling that it 
is a pl ace of respite - I will not mention the 

English saying, my castle, the place in which I 
rule -- and now it does not exist. The walls 
of the houses have been jarred apart, and fr
om the gap between them
 I can see the ruins 
of the neighboring apartment. These are all 
surrealistic images.  Du
ring those 32 days of 
fighting, Old Town was  demolished down to the ground.  Wh en we came  back in January 

1945, Wa rsaw was dead.  It was kilome ters of
, tens of, hundreds of streets where no one 
lived and burned out houses stood.  Not only 
that, but it turned 
out that the whole 
infrastructure, telephone links, 
gas, light, water, it all ha
d been destroyed underground 
with special instrume nts. I now
 know, as an architect and as 
a person who is interested in 
his city, that German scientists prepar
ed a device called a "Typhoon" which blew up 

sewers. It was ma de and used. Unfort
unately for them, it was well thought-out 

scientifical ly - assumi ng that all of the sewer entrances were cl osed. In that  case, the 

sewer would be destroyed. Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Wa rsaw 

Uprising soldiers used the sewers to travel 
under the city, some of the entrances were 
open. Even on the territory of the ghetto, a boar
d with some  debris would be placed over 
the entrance, and this ma de blowing the sewer up impossible. Which saved Wa rsaw in 

1945, because it was said that the hundreds of ki
lome ters of sewers could not be built in 
another place, but here there at least is th
e existing network. The de
struction of Wa rsaw 
was planned . I me ntioned Pabst's plan. But in
 1944, Wa rsaw was turned into a fortress, 
Festung-Wa rschau, on Hitler's orders. This fo
rtress was supposed to hold the Red Army 
at the Vistula, and to prepare the city for the fighting, sp
ecial detachme nts went around 
dynamiting city bl ocks. As if this were 
not enough, places of cultural value were 
consciously targeted for exploding, and an av
erage soldier could not do this on his own. 
In Leszno, near Poznan, in 1945, 
the files of the certified ar
chitect Menzenbach [ph - 42 
]. He was a me thodical ma n . Every card in the 
file was labeled as belonging to him, and 
each had a photograph of a place he had regist
ered, with a note next to it saying when, 
where, and what was to blown up. Looking 
through the cards, one is horrified. A 
qualified architect, a ma n whose purpose is to ra
ise buildings from th
e earth to serve ma n, 
to ma ke something beautiful, using allof his knowledge against the works of his

colleagues; he walked and classified: this is 
to be blown up, because it has value. This is 
not to be bl own up, because it is not valuable
 from a cultural standpoint . An exa mple of 
this is the Bril [ph - '53] Palace. The pa
lace is not distinguished by its architecture 
compared to a Secessionist ____ [ 55 ] standing 
next to it that had 
no cultural importance. 
But the Bril [? ] Palace wa s blown up, 
while the   ___________remained. Specialists 
walked around and said "Blow this one up, a nd leave this one alone," or else burn it 
down. Another apparatus, whose German na
me  I  do not know, was designed to destroy 

completely sites that were found to have cult
ural significance, that 
is a translation from 
the German. Those buildings that were cult
ural pillars. One of them was the Royal 
Palace, and when one looks at photographs of 
the destruction, one sees that that was not 
regular mi ning work done there I have establis
hed that a special so
rt of coal dust was 
pumped into the baseme nts of such a buildi
ng, which was then detonated. That dust tore 

buildings apart into pieces the si
ze of this cup. Nothing rema ined.  
 

Q:Are there any other matters ? 

 

A:That is the end.
