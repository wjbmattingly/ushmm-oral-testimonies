Moise We iner:Moise We iner, I was born on the 24
th
 of May, 1927 in the shtetl 
Vakhnovka (Vachnovka, Vichnifka, Wachnowka
) by name .  It™s in the Ukraine 
not far from Vinnytsya (Vinnitsa, Vi
nnytsia, Vinitza, Wi nnica, Wi nnitsa, 
Wi nniza) Region (Oblast).
 
Interviewer: Can you spell the shtetl for me ?
 
Moise We iner: V  A  C  H  N  O  V  K  A, 
Vakhnovka, not far from Lipovets (Lipovich,     
 
                         Lipovec, Lipovetz, Lipowiec).
 
 

Interviewer: Can you tell me
 a little bit about your fa mily, what your father did 
for a living, what your mother was doi
ng, how ma ny brothers and sisters you 
have.
 
 
Moise We iner:My mother had six child births; but 
one, the eldest child, died when I was born in 
 
1927, from s carlet fever.  So before war we
 were seven in all --- five children, 
three brothers and two sisters.  Before th
e Revolution my father
 began to work at 
the age of eight years, when a little b
oy, when his mother died.  I don™t know how 
to say it in English; it™s a long story 
to tell because you should know the history 
on the Ukraine.  It was under Polish influence.
  It was an estate of the Pulitz (ph? ) 
or the Polish Count; and the shtetl, the vi
llages, we re working for that estate, for 
the castle of the Pulitz.  My father was 
taken to a me rchant who bought cattle far 
distance, and they buy food.  He was 
a cowboy; simply he was a cowboy.
 
 
Interviewer: Like he drove cattle?
 
 
Moise We iner:Cattle fr om Wa rsaw to Ukraine, fr om Moldavia to that  place and 
so on.  So he was a cowboy; and before the Revolution he was a cowboy or the 
help of the merchant of th
e cattle.  After the Revolution he had no profession; he 
was an unqualified worker.  It was very ha
rd for him to earn money for a living; 

to feed seven people, seven mouths.  So we helped when we were boys; we sold 

papers.
 
 
Interviewer: Newspapers?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, you know the song, ﬁBagelach Koch Par Terrosinﬂ (ph?)?   So 

it was boys (?).  My eldest sister worked at
 the plant.  The ma in aim of our fa mily, 
because my parents were ill
iterate people, true they knew Yiddish, but they went 
to the Cheder, and they went to a Jewish
 school.  But in Russian they didn™t know 
the Russian language.  They couldn™t write
, couldn™t read.  My father was 54, 
ma ybe 56, when he started to speak Russian, 
to read the newspaper; that™s all, to 
sign his name .  Before the war he worked 
at ma rket as a tax collector.  That was 
his last job.  I want to say that they s
poiled us; the mother a
nd father, especially 
my mother.   That not ob
liging us; but simply it was a saying, ﬁIf I had a pen in 
my hand, I would – (? ).  It was a very poor region.  The people were very poor 

there; not a ghetto, but a slum.
 
 

Interviewer: Was it an agricultural region?  Did people work farms or was it in 
the city?
 
 
Moise We iner:In the city, in the city, in 
the city.  It™s an agricultural region, but 
the city had some  plots.  We survived
 in the great hunger of 1932.  I was by death 
already in 1932.  But we ma na
ged how to survive that hunger.
 
 
Interviewer: That was a very bad time , I know.  I studied about the fami ne in 

the Ukraine at that time.
 
Moise We iner:It was not an easy living. But the ma in aim of our fa mily, of my 

brothers, to get an education; because it 
was the only way to ma ke a good life, to 
get away from the Jewishness, from that 
Judaism that was, did not gave way to 
the social life surroundings because there 
was no Jewish social life.  You couldn™t 
become  an engineer studying Yiddish. 
 You couldn™t become  a doctor studying 

Yiddish.  You could become  a doctor, a
nd engineer if you studied Russian or 
Ukrainian because there were universities 
and institutes, and the schools were in 
Russian or in Ukraine.  I started at a Ukrainian school; I know the Ukrainian 
language.  So it was like nail in
 our brains to get education.
 
 
Interviewer:  Your parent
s encouraged you to study.
 
 
Moise We iner:To study, yes, and the wa r 
delayed a bit.  My elder brother got 
hired; he studied as an economist when he was 40, when he came after the war.  I 
started by correspondence because I had to 
ma ke a living, to work.  As the Bible 
says, a boy who provides himself is not 
enough.  So I never felt myself enough, to 
be enough, because I began to work.  So everybody of us get high education.
 
 
Interviewer: How much olde
r were – were you the youngest?
 
 
Moise We iner:I was the youngest of the boys. 
 My sister that wa s killed, her name  
was Yeva (ph?).  And my younger daughter who came with us now to the United 
States, I name d her after my sister.  She is Yeva.
 
 
Interviewer: How much older were your
 brothers than you were?   Your older 
brothers and sisters, how
 much older were they:
 

 
Moise We iner:Well, my el der sister was 
ten years older than me .  She was 24, and 
I was 14 when we left.  My elder brot
her was six years older, and my se cond 
brother was three years older.  Depart
 in 1941 and never get together again.
 
 
Interviewer: Yourbrothers, 
you were separated from them?
 
 
Moise We iner:We were separated all our life.  They were in the army.  The  
second brother we didn™t know if he™s
 alive until 1947, because we had no 
information about him.  He went away 
with the boys and perished.  The elder 
brother found us, me  and my sister.  Ther
e was a special office in Buguruslan, in 
the creation office, and we gave our addre
ss there.  He, from the army, made the 
inquiries, and they sent him our address, 
and he found us at the end of 1941.  That 
brother couldn™t find it.  
He couldn™t find him unt il 1947.  We  lived in separate, 
different town, cities.
 
Interviewer:  After the war?
 
 
Moise Weiner: After the war, yes.  My si
ster stayed in, there was such a town, 
Orsk in Orenburg Region.  And she got ma
rried and get her work too, oculist (?) 

in Kazakhstan.  She lives now here, there, 
all her life ther e.  I was a bit a tramp 
and changed ma ny cities in my 
life.  But most the second ha
lf of my life I lived in, 
with my wife and my children, in the center 
of Russia.  It is not far from Volga, 
there™s such a town, Penza --- Sarato
v, Penza, Kuybyshev (Kuibyshev)/Samara --- 
that™s the triangle with V
yonetsk (ph?).  It is a pl
ace where pr actically without 
Jews because  in that place, before the Revolution, Jews were not allowed to live.  

In Penza Region, the population of Penza Re
gion is about one and a half million.  
They™re mostly Russians, a million and two hundred fifty thousand are Russians; 
the rest are Tartars and 
Mordova (Moldova, Mordva). 
 The rest in official 
information is given ten thousands: that™s
 Georgians, Estonians, Syrians, Jews, 
and so on, Gypsies, and ma ybe it™s a thous
and or two thousand Jews from that 
number.  But most of them are assimilate
d Jews; no Jewish life at all.  So I can 

say that  I am an assimilated Jew in the Russian culture .  I™m a Russian writer.
 
 
Interviewer: That™s what you did after the war?  You became a writer?
 
 
Moise We iner:I studied; I became a teacher.  I st udied at an Inst itute of Foreign 

Languages.  I learned the English language, 
and I worked at school and then as an 

interpreter, a transl ator  at the plant; 
and tried to become , it™s not so easy to 
become a writer in Russia.  Well, I worked, I like to say for work; I worked to 
gain money to feed my family, to keep my
 fa mily.  Then I worked for myself at 
the table writing books.
 
 
Interviewer: For this, the book?
 
 
Moise We iner:Well, it™s not the only
; I™m an author of seven books, and I 
translated.  When I was in the age of 56, 
I learned Yiddish myself, and I translated 
from Yiddish into Russian some novels 
of Jewish writers.  And I had my own 
books, and I™m still a me mber of the Union of Russian Wr iters.  I was a member 

from 1964, s o it™s about 30 years.  So we liv
ed separate.  My br
other returned to 
Vinnytsya, my sister stayed in Octuvist 
(ph? ), Kazakhstan, and I lived in Russia.  
The last four years I lived not far from
 Moscow.  I was ten years in refuse.
 
 
Interviewer: Inwhere?
 
 
Moise We iner:I was refusenik.  Ten years, they didn™t allow me  to go.  I appealed 

in 19–  I showed you the photo when we 
forced, they are standing in 1982, I 
came to Vinnytsya.  We met, all because 
I was a year in refuse , and I was waiting 
for permission to go.  And we me t.  It was 
™91 I appealed first 
to leave the country 
because I wanted to go away from there. 
 I ma naged to get away only this year.
 
 
Interviewer: How long ago did 
you arrive in this country?
 
 
Moise Weiner:Three months and a half.
 
 
Interviewer: So you got here when?
 
 
Moise We iner:In January, the 11
th
 of January.  See, the 11
th
 is, how to say it, 
arakavua (ph?), it™s such a number.  The 11
th
 of July in 1941 I left Vinnytsya, and 
in the 11
th
 of January I left Russia too.
 
 
Interviewer: That™s right, symmetry.
 

 
Moise We iner:I don™t reme mber what is the English word for that.
 
 
Interviewer: Can you tell me  a little
 bit about Vinnytsya when you were 
growing up.  What kind of town it was lik
e?   We re there a lot of Jews there?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  It was before the 
wa r, it was like Berdychiv (Bardichev, 
Berdichev, Berditchev, Berditchov, Berdy
czow) that™s the Jewish town.
 
 
Interviewer: Very high Jewish population.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  It was a Jewish town, mostly Jewish town, and I spoke 

Yiddish in my fa mily.  We were a Yiddish
 family.  But in the street with my 

friends, it was a Jewish st
reet, a Jewish region, a Jewi
sh settleme nt, Jerusalemka 
(ph? ).  It was a mi xed language: Jewi s
h, Ukrainian, Russian, not a pure language.  
At school I started Ukrainian; all of us, 
we started in a Ukrainian school.  I think 
that it was about, ma ybe  half of the popul
ation was Jewish.  It was about ma ybe 
45,000 of Jews in Vinnytsya before the wa
r; and 36 of them were killed; 36,000 
were killed, approxima tely.  Nobody knows the exact number.  But you see even 

after forty years after the war, when you have ma rried
 and children, it recovered; 
it restored only to 10,000.  It didn™t r
ecover the Jewish population.  The rema ins 
of that population left for Israel; most of 
them.  The son of my elder brother is the 
last now who stays now in Vi
nnytsya, but he applied for –
 
 
Interviewer: Toleave.
 
Moise We iner:To leave --- he wants to 
go to the United States, not to Israel.  
Well, so when he leaves, nobody of our relatives –
 
 
Interviewer: The last of the relatives.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, it™s the last
 of the relatives in Vinnytsy
a.  But my sister is in 
Kazakhstan, and her son is 
in Leni ngrad; that ™s all.
 
 

Interviewer: Do you remember any in
stances when you were growing up of 
anti-Semitism:
 
 
Moise We iner:In Vinnytsya?
 
 
Interviewer: InVinnytsya.
 
 
Moise We iner:Only, only, how to say, in 
the street ma ybe; but there was no state 
anti-Semitism before the war.  You can call 
it, it™s not anti-Semitism.  There were 
ma ny Jewis h schools in Vinnytsya.  There wa
s even a college, a Jewish college.  
But they lost their student s, not because of anti-Semitism, but because of the 
trends of assimilation; because the main 
trend of the Jewish life was to become  
assimilated.  It was theoretically a
pproved by Marxism, because there was no 
Israel before the war.  The only way to 
become  cultured, educated people was to 
become , so the Marxists said, and it was th
e politics of the state, because it was a 
Marxist state, to help th
e Jews to become  assi mila
ted in the surrounding culture, 
the Russian Ukraine.  So it was not an act
 of anti-Semitism, but I would say quite 
contrary.  It was the desire 
to help the Jews to get away fr om that life they led 
because they were not educated; they had no profession, no skill.  They we re 
ma inly shopkeepers; not shopkeepers, but petty shopkeepers.
 
 
Interviewer: That™sbourgeois?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, it™s not bourgeois.  It
™s you bought a chicken; our neighbor, 
she bought a chicken, alive.  In our family we didn™t eat poultry from the shops.  

My mother used to go to the market to
 buy live chickens, and 
I, as the youngest, 
my duty was to go with them to the shoc
het; if you know wha t ™s that.  It wa s a 
special synagogue.  The synagogue was demo
lished in 1936 or ™37, but not as an 
act of anti-Semitism.  It was an act of religious; because not synagogues, but 
churches, Polish kosciols, they were cl
osed and demolished, too.  There is a 
special --- do you know what is kashrut?
 
 
Interviewer: Kosher,yes.
 
Moise We iner:Kosher, so if you want to have kosher poultry you have to go to a 
special  man who killed with a razor; it 
was called shochet.  He was in the 
neighborhood with the synagogue.  But when the synagogue was demolished to 
the ground, his box was left; and I brought hi
m the poultry, usually two chickens.  

But our neighbor, she bought a chicken.  She cleared from the feathers and cut it 
in four pieces and went selling it to the 
neighbors.  It was her living.  So, is she 
petty bourgeois?   This wa s the trade. 
 In our house was a metal worker, I don™t 
know in English.  The other was a kersak 
(ph?); furs, hats and clothes from fur.
 
 
Interviewer: Afurrier.
 
 
Moise We iner:A furrier, artisans ma ybe.  The second was a glass-ma ker, 

windows.  He put glasses into windows.
 
 
Interviewer:  These people
 all lived in your building?
 
 
Moise We iner:On our street.  It was such
 people.  The most educated one in our 
street was an account.  That was the intelligen
tsia of our street, that™s all.  That 
was our street.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember what your
 street was called, the name  of t he 
street?
 
 
Moise We iner:The name  of the street was called Niznagrazdowska (ph? ).  Now 
the street does not exist.  I showed you --- no st reet.  Shalom (Sholom, Sholem) 
Aleichem was the second.  It does not ex
ist now.  A bit, three house on the second 
half ma ybe are left from Shalom Aleichem
 Street.  That™s all; so, a very nice 
town, very green.  A river, a very nice
 river, The Southern Bug (Buh).  I had 
ma ny friends.
 
 
Interviewer: Were most of your 
friends Jewish or were they –?
 
 
Moise We iner:Jewish, Jewish.  Most of 
them were killed.  My best friend, his 
name  was Reva Drakob (ph? ).  He and his 
father, they stayed in the town, were 
taken for hard labor, and they worked fo
r the Nazis not far from Kiev; dug in the 
earth, I don™t know exactly what.
 
 
Interviewer: Ditches.
 

 
Moise We iner:Ditches.  And my friend, he was a boy with my a ge, ma ybe he was 
fifteen or sixteen already.  He began to 
quarrel with the --- not
 the supervisor, but 
with kapo I don™t know what --- Ukrainians, policemen; and he was killed with a 

spade, my friend.  And his father became
 mad se eing that.  After the war I came 
to Vinnytsya, and they found the family, th
e mo ther; and she did not allow me  to 
greet he r husband, the father of my friend, 
because not to di sturb him.  One of my 
best friends, he has the same  na me  a s  me , we we re sitting the same  desk in school 

seven years.  Do you understand what™s frie
ndship, if you are sitting seven years?   
He was killed during the war, and his moth
er, when she me t me in the stre et , she 
began to beat me .  She went into hysteria, she became  hysterical; why he™s killed 

and you are alive.  But she didn™t unde
rstand what she says, but she knew me  
from the boyhood.  So most of my fr
iends were killed during the war.
 
 
Interviewer: Did you go to a Jewish school?
 
 
Moise We iner:No.
 
 
Interviewer: You went to
 a public school then?
 
 
Moise We iner:I went to --- the Jewish 
schools were public schools.  They were 
not private schools.  They were state school
s, as the Ukrainians and Russians, but 
I told you that first, I wanted to go to a Jewish school. 
 But then my elder sister, 

she took me  away from there because she 
wanted to ma ke, not a career, but to 
ma ke life better.  You have to go to, not
 only me , but everybody decided.  I went 
to, my brothers, me  and my sister, we  a
ll went to Ukrainian schools; started in 
Ukrainian schools,  it™s not public.  But before the war there were three Jewish 

schools.  But if in our class, in the se
venth class, were ma ybe 40 pupils in one 
class; in Jewish school we re only five.  
And one of my friends who went to the 

Jewish schools, he said that we arelucky because  we are aske d by the teacher 

ma ybe once in two weeks; and he had to
 prepare his lessons every day because 
they are only five pupils in the class.  
It was before the war, but ma ybe at the 
beginning of the war they are full.  Afte
r the war, no Jewish schools.  The ma in 
language in the streets was Jewish.
 
 
Interviewer: Hebrew or Yiddish?
 
 

Moise We iner:No, Yiddish.  Hebrew was 
not in favor; it™s loshn-koydesh (Lashon 
HaKodesh), it™s only for the prayers. 
 But every day was Jewish, Yiddish.  
Therefore, Ukrainian or Jewish was the la
nguage.  After the war, ma ybe 50 years, 
I had Jewish speech; but the last years, no Jewish language.
 
 
Interviewer: Let me  ask you, do you reme mber any of --- I know that you know 
the Germans come  to power; the Nazis come  to power in Germany in 1933.  Did 

you know, or did people in your fami ly know
, about the Germans; what the Nazis 
were doing in Germany at this time ?
 
 
Moise We iner:Well, I can tell you one detail
 of the beginning of the war what the 
people heard about the Germans.  It is an 
emotional.  When the war, I was in the 
street with my friend.  He photographed me
, and we went to the shop to buy some  
chemicals for the negatives.  And the wa
y they announced it at 12 o™clock, the 
prime mi nister will be speaking with the 
urgent infor mation.  And we went home, 
because we were waiting for some thing like that.  It was Molotov speaking, and 
when he announced that we are at war with 
the Germans, I run out
 into the street.  
From every house in that street there 
was not weeping, but howling, like about 
death.  The people felt that th
ey are doome d to death.  Th
at was the first feeling.  
That was the attitude, the knowledge about
 the Germans.  Surely we knew about 
the Nazi™s attitude to the Jews, but not at 
that – that was the fi rst reaction; and it 
was an exact reaction.
 
Interviewer: Do you remember in 1939 when the Germans and the Soviet 
Union divided Poland; do you reme mber wh
at people thought about that at the 
time?   We re they concerned that the Ge
rmans we re going to come  on in to the 
Soviet Union, or were they not ve
ry concerned?  Do you remember?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  My father, the ma tter
 is that Vinnytsya, the railroad was to 
the west was through Vinnytsy
a; and we saw the trains
 with goods that were 
butter, flour, and so on.  We didn™t get 
bread enough, and everything was sent to 
Germany.  That™s the first time; but when
 the Germans went into Finland in 1940 

–
 
 
Interviewer: When the Germans went into Finl and?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, after we were at wa
r with Finland, the Germans were invited 
by the Finns to come  in; and when they we
nt there, my father said, ‚that™s war™.
 

 
Interviewer: He knew that they were going to attack after that.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, that™s war.  He 
was not very great politician, but he 
understand.  He was a very clever ma n.  
He understood; he was not educated, but 
life educated him.  Life is a very go
od teacher.  He understand when they went 
into Roma nia, that they are ready to go to war.  He understood it quite well.
 
 
Interviewer: So it wasn™t a surpri se when they attacked?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no, it was not a surprise, because we were waiting every da y 

for that.  We  were not far from the old 
frontier, and my brother was in the army; 
and he was on special courses in Ch
isinau (Kishinev, Keshenev, Keshinov, 
Khisinau, Kishenew, Kiscinev, Kishinef, 
Kiszyniow).  But his division was in 
Comr at (Komrat).  Now if you followed the events in Russia, the Gagauz 

(Gagauzia, Gagauz Yeni) Republic ther
e on the south; the 
capital of that 
autonomy is Comr at.  And he was servi
ng in Comr at; but he was in courses, 
special courses.  He was in Chisinau, and hi
s last letter was that he™s recalled to 
his --- it was the 29
th
 of May --- and when he got this
 letter, my father said, ‚that™s 
awful™.  He understood it.
 
 
Interviewer: That was the 29
th
 of May in 1941.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.
 
 
Interviewer: So about a month before the war started.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, because  the Germans were there already in Roma nia.  He 

understood what --- he knew it not fr om the 
papers, but he knew it from life; the 

move me nt of our brothe
rs, our sons, everything.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember what th
e papers were saying at that time?
 
 
Moise We iner:I don™t know exactly; but it was ‚be calm™ .
 

 
Interviewer: That war wouldn™
t happen, and things like that?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes. Yes.
 
 
Interviewer: You said that your brother 
was in the army.  When did he go into 
the army, your older brother?
 
 
Moise We iner:1940.
 
 
Interviewer: He went into the army 
in 1940, and that™s your oldest brother?
 
 
Moise We iner:Oldest brother.
 
 
Interviewer: What was his name ?
 
 
Moise We iner:Israel.  We  all had biblical name s.  I™m Moshe, Moise, Moses.  
He™s Israel; and my second brother is
 Shimson something, Simson; I don™t know 
–
 
 
Interviewer: Oh,Sa ms on.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  Sa ms on, Sa ms on the gi
bber (ph?), Shimson 
the gibber.  In 
Yiddish it™s – in Hebrew it is Sams on the strongest, the giant, Sams on.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember --- let™s s
ee, you told me  a little bit about when 
the war started, when you said the people were howling when they heard about 
the war starting.  After that, what happened?
  What did people do?   Did people try 
to get away?  Did they run?
 
 

Moise We iner:Yes, the people tried to get --- my sister urged my father to get 
away imme diately on November the 24
th
.  But we were very poor, and we had no 
money, and –
 
 
Interviewer: This was your ol
der sister who said this?
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  She was the most cu
ltured; she understood
 better than anyone 
what is happening.  Three days she stayed
 in a line on the station to buy a ticket.
 
 
Interviewer: For three days she did?
 
 
Moise We iner:She didn™t ma nage to get a ticket.
 
 
Interviewer: But she stood in line for three days?
 
 
Moise We iner:She stood in line beginning from the 26
th
 until the 29
th
, and then 
they canceled to sell tickets.
 
 
Interviewer: And this was tickets for the train?
 
 
Moise We iner:Tickets for the train; he want
ed to go to Kiev.  We hoped that Kiev 
would never be occupied.  The myth was 
that when the Germans would come  to 
the old frontier, fire will fire them off.  
They will perish in fire because we had a 
myth that our frontier is like a line
 of Maginot.  So we hope, and we –
 
 
Tape 1, Side B
 
 
Moise We iner:29
th
 or 30
th
 of May, of J une; but it wa s th
en to deal with that panic 
the authorities spread.  Not the news, but
 hearing, I don™t know
, that the cavalry 
of Budyonny (Budyonnyy, Budennii, Budenny, Budyoni, Budyenny), there was 
such a commander, a hero of the civil war, of the Revolution, that his cavalry 
pushed back the Germans and liberated 
L™viv (Lvov, Lwow, Lemberg, Leopol).  
And the people went home .
 
 

Interviewer: They were calmed by that.
 
 
Moise Weiner:By that; returned to thei
r home s, not every – But the authorities 
used these two days to form echel
on and to send away their fa milies.
 
 
Interviewer: The governme nt people did this?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, the Communists, the local –
 
 
Interviewer: Because they knew what was happening?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  They sent away 
in passenger cars w
ith their dogs and 
suitcases (?) with their home  flowers.  
People saw that, after the second of June 
when they se nt away their families, the panic bega n again.  On the fifth, the youth 
was sent away from the town.
 
 
Interviewer: All the youth was, yeah.
 
 
Moise Weiner:– is my brother.
 
 
Interviewer: Oh, to go to the army; all 
the people who were of age to go in the 
army.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, they were taken away
; and little by little the town became  
empty.  It was every night it was bombed by the Germans.
 
 
Interviewer: When did the bombing s t art, do you reme mber?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, the first bombing was on the 24
th
 of June, on the second day 
of the war; on the third day of the war.
  And he came every day right at twelve 
o™clock.
 
 

Interviewer: Twelve o™clock at noon?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no, in the night.  And he bombe d mostly with fire bombs  to 
ma ke.  And he knew what to bomb, he 
knew what to bomb.  First he bombed 
stores --- me dicine stores
, the food stores, the Red Ar my building, and so on.  So 
was the first bombing.
 
 
Interviewer: And that continued on every day?
 
 
Moise We iner:Every day, every day.
 
 
Interviewer: What did your fa mily do?
 
 
Moise We iner:Every night we went to th
e bomb she lters.  We  spent the night in 
the bomb shelter.
 
 
Interviewer: How far away from
 your house was the bomb shelter?
 
 
Moise Weiner:Not far.  It™s maybe three --- it was in a Jewish school, in a 
baseme nt of a Jewish school; not far, tw
o or three, two bloc
ksaway ma ybe.  We  
made trenches.  I remember; on this place we dug trenches.  In the day we sat 

there.  It was a deep trench, ma ybe two 
me ters deep, covered with logs.  We sat 
there.  But after that , a bo mb struck 
one trench, and everybody was killed; we 
preferred to go to the bomb shelter.
 
 
Interviewer: You said that your family didn™t have enough money to go, to 

leave.
 
 
Moise Weiner:I won™t say.  Well, we c
ouldn™t get tickets to the railway.  The 
question was to buy a pair of horses and 
a cart and go away.  My mother was an 
ill woma n; she was not ve ry old I understand now, she was 48.  But she had 

thrombosis (?), if you know what™s that?
 
 

Interviewer: No.
 
 
Moise We iner:It™s va ricose veins.  We
 discussed several variants how to get 
away.  By foot she couldn™t go.  Tobuy horses and a cart,
 no money.  To get 
together with some body, very poor people,
 no money.  So we didn™t know what to 
do.  The only way was the railroad station. 
 So we went on the eighth of July; we 
went to the ra ilway st ation, that™s all.
 
 
Interviewer: Andthat™swh
en your parents put you on –
 
 
Moise Weiner:It was we sat three days th
ere, not be able to get, only on the 11
th
 
of July they gave eight open cars, open
 wagons.  So we departed on the station 
with my parents on the 11
th
 of July.
 
 
Interviewer: Did they tell you anything wh
en they left as to what you should do, 
what you should try to do, just
 go where they took you or –
 
 
Moise Weiner:We didn™t think that  the Ge
rmans would really come .  My father, 
because the bombings were every day, told
 that the children must be sent away 
from the town, from the bombing.  He di
dn™t think that the Germans would come 
because the old frontier will stop them.  He 
was sure that  it would be so.  So he 

gave us a loaf of bread and a piece of fat; Ukrainian bread, that™s all we ha d with 

ourselves for three days.  He told us for three days it would be enough for you.  

You would go some where.  I don™t reme mber, I was a boy; I don™t reme mber 

exactly what, but that was the whole suppl
y.  Instead of three days, a week were 
100 kilometers.
 
 
Interviewer: For one week you only ma de 100 ki lome ters on the train?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  We  stopped every half hour.
 
Interviewer: Because of the bombing?
 
 
Moise We iner:Bombing, blocking of the rail
s and so on.  The peasants didn™t --- 
we went to a village to buy some thing.  
They didn™t want to get the money, it™s 

paper; give some thing, we hadn™t.  We  ha d nothing.  Change, natural change; they 

didn™t take money.  So I don™t reme mber
 exactly any instruction what to do, 
because nobody knew what to do.
 
 
Interviewer: Was this a special  trai
n to get children out of the city?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no; a train; who had 
passes.  The passes was to Kuybyshev; 
the pass was to Kuybyshev.
 
 
Interviewer: How did you and your sister
 get passes?   Did your parents buy 
them for you?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no.  I told you that my sister was engaged, and he was an 

officer in the army.  And his family get pa
sses.  The pass was for four people.  His 
parents did not go.  His two si
sters, three sisters, took fo
r one place my sister.  I 
was without a pass.  I was thrown s
imply on the edge (?); that™s all.
 
 
Interviewer: Yourfather
 threw you on the train?
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  He saved me  my life; give me  my life for the second time.
 
 
Interviewer: As far as you knew, the train was just going to go to Kuybyshev; 

and that™s as far at it would go?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.
 
 
Interviewer: How long did it take you
 to get from Vinnytsya to Kuybyshev?
 
 
Moise We iner:We didn™t get to Kuybyshev.
 
 
Interviewer: You never ma de it there?
 
 
Moise We iner:We were bombed.  Not fa
r from Vinnytsya was a satcha (ph? ) 
station of Sinivka (ph?).  We  were bombe
d there, and then after that we met the 

sisters of my  sister™s gr oo m;  they were in
 the army.  And we stayed in the hospital 
with them, in a military hospital.  And after that , they put us in an echel on of 

wounded; my sister and his 
two sisters, as me dical si
sters to help the wounded.
 
Interviewer: That was going to the East?
 
 
Moise We iner:To the East, yes; and we
 ma naged to go only 18 or 16 kilome ters 
from that station.  We met the German ta
nks, five tanks.  They began to shell the 
locomotives, stopped him, set him the fi re.  We  didn™t understand what was 

happening.  We thought it was bombing, simply
 bombing.  We didn™t catch it; the 
Germans are here already.  So, but wh
en we looked out, we saw five tanks 
approaching and shelling the echelon; a
nd they shelled every, setting fire.
 
 
Interviewer: Was this train ma rked as
 a wounded train, like a Red Cross on it, 
or anything?
 
 
Moise We iner:Do not reme mber.  It was 
cars, like, not passe
nger cars, but we 
called them Japluski (ph?).  That™s for cattle.
 
 
Interviewer: Cattlecar.
 
 
Moise We iner:Cattle car or for foods; not food, but car for products, produce --- 

freight.  And there were shelves, mi d-sh
elves, and the wounded were lying on the 
shelves and on the floor --- both sides. 
 And we were helping them who was 
without in the head, with le
gs, and very hard wounded.  And they set every car in 
fire; and who could run, they jumped out, 
and we ran away.  And those who could 
not run, could not move, they perished in th
at fire.  So, it was such an experience, 
yeah.  So after that, we ran by foot, 
maybe 24 hours, running from –.  Those 
tanks, they were running after us and tried 
to shell, how to say it, to kill you with 
the shell, the running soldiers.  They we
re playing; the aim was like shooting.  
And we were running about 24 hours; don™t st
op.  After the war, I found that there 
was when we went to such a town, Um
an, on the Ukraine.  And after the war 
when I was writing that book about the 
war, I learned that the Germans 
surrounded three armi es from that town. 
 It was called the Uman cattle.  They 
took like 100,000 soldiers and officers, onl
y like prisoners of war.  But we 
ma naged to get out from that loop.
 
 
Interviewer: From the trap?
 

 
Moise We iner:From that trap; and we went
 out, not to the east,
 but to the south, 
southwest [was more likely southeast] to
 the railroad, such a town, Pervomays™k.  
And from there we caught a train;  it was ma
ybe weeks, (?? ) .  So we never came to 
Kuybyshev.  We  ca me  to Kuybyshev afte
r two mo nths, ma ybe, of moving; but 
they didn™t wait for us.  So 
we went further to the Urals.  We  wanted to go to the 
mi ddle Asia, most of them.  Most of th
e echelons were directed to the mi ddle 
Asia, but when we sprang out from t he tanks running, I was in a shirt and the 

trousers, and my sister wa s in a thin su
mmer dress.  And that was all we had on 
us.  And after two months, we were shabby and lousy, without money; and we 
decided to stop our running not far from Or
enburg.  And one of our sisters, a girl, 
she got a job in Orsk; and we lived 10 pe
ople in such a room.  And there it was at 
the end of September –.
 
 
Interviewer: Now Orsk is in the Ural s?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, it™s in the South Urals.  
It is on the river Ural
.  It is the fr ontier 
between Europe and Asia; so you can stay
 in Europe, cross 
the bridge, and you 
are in Asia.  So I lived on two continents
; it™s divided.  That town is situated on 
both sides of that river, and th
at™s in Europe and in Asia.
 
 
Interviewer: When you arrived there, wh
at did you do?   Did they put you to 

work?
 
 
Moise We iner:My sister got a job, and I found a job.
 
 
Interviewer: What was your job?
 
 
Moise We iner:My first job was a terrific one.  I was a little boy.
 
 
Interviewer:  You were
 about 14 at this time?
 
 
Moise We iner: Fourteen, ye s.  I was more than 14 because I was born in Ma y and 

that was in September; and 14 and three,
 four months.  I we
nt to (don™t know 

what it is in English) tshicago (ph?); what
™s tshicago, how they call that cattle is 
killed.
 
 
Interviewer:  How they k
ill cattle?   A slaughterhouse?
 
 
Moise We iner:Slaughterhouse, yes; a huge 
slaughterhouse, and th
e cattle is killed.  
And from the meat is sausages and so 
on; conserve, baked, so–.  I worked there 
10 days.  It was a specialty, 
I don™t know; the hind part of a cow, frozen, with 
such a knife.  I had to clear the meat from the bones, and it™s a great skill to put 
the knife between the bone and not the 
meat; but if you know if me at.  You know 
that between the bone and 
meat is some layer –
 
Interviewer: Ame mbrane.
 
 
Moise We iner:A me mbrane; and if you do 
not put your knife between the surface 
of the bone and that me mbrane, you will suffer a great deal because you will not 
cut –
 
Interviewer: Hard to cut it.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, hard to cut.  I had not the skill to do it, and it was heavier than 

I myself and frozen.  On the 10
th
 day, I put the knife in
to the fingers, and I got 
blood infection.  So it was blue, my hand.  I went away from that.  After when 
they healed my hand, I went to sewing --- 
not fabric --- it was enterprise, so –
 
 
Interviewer: This is where they built sewing machines?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no.  It™s where sewing
 uniform for the army --- women mo stly; 
and I started.  First I was an apprentice,
 and then when I was 15, I became ma ster 
of the shift because the gr own-up were ca
lled to the front.  And I and three other 
boys were the gang that had to check regular
ly to repair the machines.  So I was a 
qualified ma ster at 16.  At 16, I had th
e highest qualific
ation, the eighth 
qualification for master.  And there I 
worked all the war until 1945, until I was 
called to the army.
 
 
Interviewer: And you we re called into the army in 1945?
 
 

Moise We iner:Yes.
 
 
Interviewer: What time of year; do you reme mber ?
 
Moise We iner:It was after the war.  I was 18 in May, and it was in June or July.  
In August I was called to Leninburg (ph? ) [p
erhaps Leningrad].  It was in August 
already.  But I did not serve in the ar
my.  I was called to Lindacher (ph? ) 
Academy, a nd I did not ma nage to get into it.
 
 
Interviewer: Can you tell me
 a little bit about the town
 that you were in, in 
Orsk; what it was like at that time during 
the war?  We re there lots of hardship, 
was there much food there?
 
 
Moise We iner:No; it is – if you know t he history of Russia, ma ybe you know of 

the Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko.  
Taras Shevchenko was in exile in that 
town, last century.  Whe n he was in that 
town, he wrote about it.  It is a town 
where nothing to hank (?) yourself.  It™s St
eppe.  It was forme d as a fortress the 
Russians used to expanding into the mi ddle As
ia.  In Asia they used to form in the 
Steppe, fortresses.  Orsk was at fi rst a military fortress.
 
 
Interviewer: An outpost or some thing.
 
 
Moise We iner:Outpost, it™s an outpost as you 
call it.  It™s a hill 
--- the first.  The 
outpost was built on a hill.  It looks around 
the Steppe.  Before the war, they 
found nickel.
 
 
Interviewer: Nickel,themetal.
 
 
Moise Weiner:Metal.  And they built a very
 large plant there, nickel plant.  And 
many enterprises from the Ukraine, Russia, 
were evacuated to that town.  Most of 
them were military.  Over the fence there was fr om Moscow, a plant.  Boys were 

working.  They ma de mines, yeah.  We 
were sewing ammunition for garment (?), 
and they were ma king mines.  The others
 were ma king shells and so on.  It was 
mostly plants, military plants, and three labor camps.  It was gulag, one of the 

gulag places.  They were mostly enga
ged, exploited, in building the houses.  
There was socialist town.  They built th
e houses in that town; some  schools, ma ny 
hospitals, and that™s a sla
ughter house, and that™s all 
I suppose.  Now it™s a very 

large industrial town.  Food, food, ther
e was no food.  There was no food; the 
system was they had cards ---
 
 
Interviewer: A ration ca rd?
 
 
Moise We iner:Ration card, yes.  We  got --- I got 500 grams of bread.
 
 
Interviewer:  Every day?
 
Moise We iner:Every day, but it was not enough.
 
 
Interviewer: Did you get a
nything else besides bread?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, we used these cards only in the dining --- not restaurants, but 
they were called; not fabric
, but had its own dining –
 
 
Interviewer: Canteenor–
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, and there we dined ther
e.  We  had dinner there, and we had to 
give our cards there.  And I had a gardenwith my  sister; we raised potatoes.  And 

your --- I don™t remembe r --- Wallace maybe; was not the ambassador to Russia, 

but he was a special envoy of Roose velt 
in Russia.  He called those gardens, 
vegetabl e gardens, victory gardens; because
 if not those gardens, it would be very 
hard to survive.  So we had some  supply
 of potatoes for the winter.  That™s all I 
suppose what we had.  But work, I worked; the shift was for the machines was 10 
hours; one hour the break, one hour to cha
nge the shift.  It was 12 hours; 24 hours 
were divided into two.
 
 
Interviewer: So some  people worked in the day, and some  people worked at 
night.  Is that how it worked?
 
 
Moise We iner:We changed; one week in th
e day and one week in the night.  The 
shift began at eight o™clock in the morn
ing and ended at ei
ght o™clock in the 
evening.  The night shift began at eight o™
clock in the evening and ended at eight 

o™clock.  But we, the mechanics, ha d to work mu ch more because we were 
obliged to work some two, thr
ee hours to help our colleagues.
 
 
Interviewer: You all ma de sure th
e machines were running all right?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, because we had no supplies of details, of spare parts during 

the war; and the machines were out of wo
rk, most  of them.  So the usual working 
day for me  was 14, 16 hours.  And if that ma ster who had to change me , if he fell 

ill, I was put, as they ca lled 
it, that time on the war situ
ation; had no right to leave 
the shop and could prolong three, four
 a week, round the clock work.  Five 
mi nutes sleep was a happy change.
 
 
Interviewer: And you did th
is until the end of the wa
r?   This is where you 
worked?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah.
 
Interviewer: Ithinkthat™s
 all the questions I have 
about your story.  Can I ask 
you about your parents?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, I told you some  things.
 
 
Interviewer: You™re right; let™s go ba
ck.  Tell me  where they were born and 
their names. 
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, well I cannot say exactly
 where they were; I think they were 
born in Vakhnovka.  They were ma rried in Vakhnovka, in the same  shtetl where I 

was born.
 
 
Interviewer: What was your mother™s name ?
 
 
Moise We iner:I want you to explain me
 one thing, with the name s.  Nobody 
knows the full name , because when the Jews 
were given last name s, wha t  you call 
here, they were not gi ven their real Je wish name s, but depending on the place 

where they lived or to th
e Count to whom they belonged.  In the Ukraine the 

names were distorted.  So my brother is 
a Suar  (ph?); but in the Ukraine, it was 
distorted to Srue (ph? ).  
I saw even here in America, a ma n died, and his name ™s 
Srue; not a Suar, but a Sr ue.  It
™s not a name ; it™s some thing –
 
 
Interviewer: It™s like a nickname or something?
 
 
Moise We iner:It™s not a nickname ; it™s like Bob, Robert and Bob.
 
 
Interviewer: Yeah, that would be a nic
kname .  Li ke my na me  is Anthony; my 
real name  is Anthony, but my nickname  is Tony.
 
 
Moise Weiner:So my father™s father™s na
me , not my  father, but my grandfather™s 
name ; I only last year found it 
in the Bible.  It is Iss
achar (Yissachar); Isischor 
(ph? ) in English.  But my father™s second name was --- he was Isaac; my father 
Sauschis (ph?), not Issachar, but Sachar (ph?
).  You have half a name.  So what is 
the name of my mother?   The real, 
I don™t know; I know she was called Machla.
 
 
Interviewer: Machla, and that was her fi rst name?
 
 
Moise We iner:Her first name , and her ma iden na me was Sandler.  And when she 

ma rried, she became We iner.
 
 
Interviewer: So your father™s --- he  was Isaac We iner?
 
Moise We iner:Isaac We iner, yes.  Russian transcription of Machla is Ma ria.  We ll 
ma ybe we be transcribed as so, but
 we don™t know is it really so.
 
 
Interviewer: Machla looks fi ne to me.
 
 
Moise Weiner:Fine, yeah?  Well, it™s Machla.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember the years 
that they were bor
n, their birthdays?
 
 

Moise We iner:Yes; the birthday I don™t know.
 
 
Interviewer: But the year?
 
 
Moise We iner:The year I tell you, it was ™86 for my  father.
 
Interviewer: 1886?
 
 
Moise Weiner:Yes; and ™92 for my mot her.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you know when they were ma rried?
 
 
Moise We iner:Twelve, 1912.  I reme mb er quite well because my mother had in 
the house a picture, hand worked it.
 
 
Interviewer: Oh, needlepoint or something like that?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, needlework, and the date was of their ma rriage, 1912.  I 
reme mber it.  I see it before my eyes now, even now.
 
 
Interviewer: I know we talked about wh
at your father did; that he was a 
cowboy.
 
 
Moise We iner:He was a cowboy in his 
younger–  Then he was ma ybe a bit of 
me rchant maybe, I don™t know; before the Revolution.
 
 
Interviewer: Was your mother, was sh
e just a housewife or did she –?
 
 
Moise We iner:She was a housewife all her life, as far as I reme mber.  She had 

five children to keep, to bring up.  She be
gan her day at five in the morning and 
ended at two in the night.  And she di
d nothing in the eyes of the household.
 

Interviewer: I think most mothers get th
at, unfortunately.  They do a lot, but 
nobody actually sees what they do, unfort
unately.  Wa s you family, your parents 
especially, were they very religious?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, my fat her was religious.  I remember hi m to take me  with 
hims elf to the synagogue.  But when the synagogue was destroyed, he prayed at 

home .  He had phylacteries, I reme mber, a
nd the shawl.  He was religious, yeah.  

My mother went to the s
ynagogue too, but not every day.
 
 
Interviewer: Did your father go every day?
 
 
Moise We iner:On the holidays, mostly, because you see the synagogue was 

destroyed in 1936 or ™37.  I was a boy 
of nine or ten; I don™t reme mber.  I 
reme mber only that the last effort of 
my father to keep to religion was enough.  
Before the war, he and his neighbor, th
ere is such a Jewish holiday as Succos 
(Sukkos, Sicchos) in Yiddish, Sukkot (Su
ccot); they tried to ma ke a sukkah 

(siccha).  It™s a tent  maybe with greens a
nd so forth.  Then, when they were sitting 
in that sukkah, drinking wine, ma ybe , I 
don™t remember, a military man came and 
destroyed that.
 
 
Interviewer: He knocked it over?
 
 
Moise We iner:Knocked it over, yes; 
and pulled them away from there.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember when that happened?
 
 
Moise We iner:It was not long before the 
war.  That was, I don™t reme mber, the 
last effort to; after that he 
stayed home , prayed only at home.
 
 
Interviewer: Did your father ever talk
 about World Wa r I or the Revolution.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah.
 
 

Interviewer: Was he in the First World War?
 
 
Moise We iner:He was not; but he was, two 
times, he was nearly killed.  The first 
time --- maybe you know that during the Civil War there were many gangs, 
nationalistic gangs, that when they came  
to a Jewish shtetl, they ma de pogroms 
killing people.  My father was young enough, 
and he took part in a band of self-
defense, sammabaronika (? ).  When one of
 the gangs of Petlur
a (Petliura, Petlyura 
?) came, five people, and they were caught
 by the Petlurivtsa (?
); and they want 
them to be shot.  And the same time my mo
ther rushed, not to the rebbe, but to the 
Christian –
 
 
Interviewer: Priest or  – ?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, the priest, the Christian, the Pope.
 
 
Interviewer: The priest , yeah.
 
 
Moise We iner:The priest , yeah, the pr iest
, the priest, and asked him for help to 

save the life of her husband.  When they 
were brought to the lawn, was very green 
grass.  And the leader of that gang said, ‚i
t™s a pity to spoil such grass with Jewish 
blood;™ let us go further.  And that sa
ved them the life because the priest 
succeeded to come to the place and stopped th
e killing in the name  of Christ.  And 
they were set free.  And my father, I reme
mber, told that  he was in such strength 
that his hands were bound, that he–
 
Interviewer: Oh my gosh, he broke the bones.
 
 
Moise We iner:He broke the bones.  It was the first time.  So it was the legends (? ) 

of our family, this killing, the second kill
ing –  Wa s in their shtetl one of the --- I 
don™t know how to call it --
- a soldier, a gangster.  He rushed in the house.
 
 
Interviewer: Into your parents™ house?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, and began to beat -
-- the Cossacks had on a stick, leather ---
 
 

Interviewer: Awhip?
 
 
Moise We iner:A whip, nagaika (nagayka, 
nagyka) in Russian.  At the end he had 
a leaden bob; it can kill you. 
 And she had a little chil
d, a baby, on her hand; and 
he began to beat her.  And she was saved only, she told me , that she pressed 
herself to the wall protecting 
the kid; and when he hit her, the bob couldn™t get at 
her, but on the wall.  The bob struck the 
wall, but not the –  And that saved her 
the life and the life of the child.  Mayb
e it was my brother that died in 19.. (1927 
?), maybe that™s what.  That™s the ex
perience of my parents in that war.
 
 
Interviewer: That was during the Civil Wa r?
 
 
Moise We iner:The Civil War, yeah.
 
Interviewer: Do you ever reme mber y
our father speaking, or your parents 

speaking about the Revolution?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, why not?   They did 
not ma ke difference between the Civil 
War and the Revolution, because the Revol
ution was not on the Ukraine.  There 
was no Revolution;  there was only Civil 
Wa r, because the Revolution was in 
Russia, and there they came  to restore th
e Soviet power.  And the Civil War there 
were ma ny gangs, Makhno (Machno), Petlura
, Teutoni (ph?), Degrees (ph? ), and 
so on.  They told many stories about --- th
ere were stories only about the beating 
of Jews; bad, that™s all.  And about the Ge
rmans; one of the faults of the Jews on 
the Ukraine was that they reme mber ed the Germans of that time.
 
 
Interviewer: From the fi rst war?
 
 
Moise Weiner:From the fi rst war.  Are th
ey not Hilmen (ph? )?
  They are Hilmen 
(ph? ).
 
 
Interviewer: Honorable people, yes.
 
 
Moise We iner:Honorable people; people like 
we are.  That™s propaganda, and that 
was the mi stake.  If we knew really what is comi ng, but who knew that?
 

 
Interviewer: Did most of the Jews in the Ukraine feel that way, that the 
Germans were relatively decent people, a
nd that they wouldn™t do these things to 
them? 
 
 
Moise Weiner:Yeah, yeah.  Well I 
think ma ny of them who re me mber.
 
 
Interviewer: The older generation.
 
 
Moise We iner:The older generation; th
e young knew.  We  read books.  We  knew 
films; we saw fil ms about – Professor 
Maml ock was such a film.  We read 
Vectaya™s (ph?) books, and so we knew --- 
the papers, the radi o --- before the 
pact; before the pact between Molo
tov and Ribbentrop, 
the propaganda was 
against the Nazis.  So, we were a bit educ
ated in that field. 
 We knew what Nazis 
meant.  But older generation, ‚sota vitenhop™ (ph?).
 
 
Interviewer: You said that your father
, after the Re volution, he didn™t have, you 
know after the Civil Wa r also, he was an uns
killed laborer because he didn™t have, 
I guess, an industrial job before the war; 
so he didn™t really have a job after the 
war.  But he worked as a tax collector?
 
Moise We iner:No, he worked as a driver
.  He had horses at one time; you know, a 
belagula (ph?).  What is a belagula, in Yi
ddish, in Ukraine?   It
™s a driver, it™s not 
passengers you drive, but stones, bricks, and so on.
 
 
Interviewer: So he tr
ansported these things.
 
 
Moise We iner:Transported, yeah.  That
 was a long time his job until the mi d of 
the thirties.  Then he lost
 his horses, and he was –
 
 
Interviewer: How did he lose his horses, do you reme mber?   Di d they die?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  One died, and the second he sold.  He had two horses.  Then 
he worked as a night watch – 
 
 

Interviewer: Nightwatchman?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah.  And the last  years when he became a bit ill, he became in 
the market; it™s an open market, so a tax 
collector.  And that
 was his last job.
 
 
Interviewer: There was a larg
e open ma rket in Vinnytsya?
 
 
Moise We iner:Two.
 
 
Interviewer: Twoma rkets.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah.
 
 
Interviewer: One was near your home ?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, they were both not near. 
 One, on this place, when we arrived 
to settle here; ther e was a little ma
rket here, but it was demolished by the 
authorities.  But two big ma rkets were on 
that end of the city, and the second, the 
best, were on the other side.
 
 
Interviewer: What did he collect taxe
s on?   Wa s it on the things that people 
sold, or is that how he collected–?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, for the place.
 
 
Interviewer: Oh, for the place.  So he
 took fees for people to set up their 
booths?
 
Moise Weiner:Yeah, yeah; I reme mber th
at.  If you come  with a wagon of goods, 
you had to have a place; and you 
have to pay a ruble for that.
 
 
Interviewer: Did anybody in your family ev
er become  Communists?   Were they 
in the Koms omol or in the –?
 

 
Moise We iner:In my fa mily, my father
 and my mother, no.  Wh at™s about my 
brothers and sisters, we 
were all in Komsomol.  My
 brothers during the war 
became Communists and my sister, too.
 
 
Interviewer: So they joined the party.
 
 
Moise We iner:They joined the part y.  I 
never joined the party.  I was, as we 
called, non-party Bolshevik; so we called itin Russia.  I thought that three from 

us, it™s enough for the party.  I™ll be free. 
 I don™t like party discipline; so I told, 
no.
 
Interviewer: When we talked about befo
re the Germans ca me  and right before 
the war, can you tell me  what you reme mber; and what you know about what 

happened to your parents after they put you on the train in 1941?
 
 
Moise We iner:No.  We  tried to find out w
ho saw them the last, and we have very 
vague idea.  You see hope dies the las
t; so we hoped that they survived.
 
 
Interviewer: You don™t know what happened?
 
 
Moise We iner:We didn™t know.  I tried,
 you see, the whole 
my life I tried to 
understand what was my father had been
 doing between the time the Nazis came 
and his death; from day to death.  I see th
ey were put to work from the jail.  But 
there is a book, exists such
 a book, the American author of John Hersey.  He has 
written a book, 
The Wall
, about the Warsaw ghetto. 
 He has written that book 
using the Ringelblum papers.  I only here
 in America, I ma naged to get that book, 

Ringelblum™ s Diaries.  My daughter ma de me
 a  copy of it.  Now I™ m reading that.  
But that book of Hersey™s was writtenin 1950 or ™53, ma ybe.   I didn™t know 

about it; I came across it 
only in 1983.  And in that book I read everything I 
wanted to.  It™s a book about the war a
nd the ghetto, and what the Jews were 
doing from day to day from the beginning of
 the occupation.  So that™s a great 
book from my point of view.
 
 
Interviewer: So you don™t know what happe
ned to your parents after they put 
you on the train---you and your sister?
 

Moise Weiner:No, no.  He told me maybe he will go to Rakhnovka, to the parents 
of my mother; but they didn™t do anything. 
 They returned home , and they were 
caught by the Germans there.
 
 
Interviewer: And that™s all you know?
 
 
Moise We iner:That™s all I know, yeah.
 
 
Interviewer: Can I ask you about your uncle?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, that™s my uncle; Isaac too.
 
 
Interviewer: He was also Isaac?  
 
 
Moise Weiner:Isaac, yes.
 
Interviewer: And he was your mother™s brother?
 
 
Moise Weiner:Yes, it™s my mother™s brother.
 
 
Interviewer: So he would be Sandler, also?
 
 
Moise We iner:Sandler; he™s Sandler, yes.
 
 
Interviewer: Was he also born in –
 
 
Moise We iner:Rakhnovka, yes.  They were all born in Rakhnovka; they came  

from Rakhnovka, all.  Well, I cannot sa
y that tree of –, theological tree–
 
 
Interviewer: The fa mily tree?
 
 

Moise We iner:We were not used to --- I know my parents and my grand–, that™s 
all.  I saw my grandfather, my mother™s 
father, maybe two time s in my life.  He 
was a grey-bearded (? ), and he lived until 
86.  If he would not have been killed, 
ma ybe he would have.  He was a very strong ma n.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember
 when your uncle was born?
 
 
Moise We iner:No; I know he was younger than my mother; the difference, ma ybe 

two years.
 
 
Interviewer: I™ll put 1890 then.
 
Moise We iner:™94, ma ybe ™95.  So he was 45, ma ybe he was, when the war 
began.
 
 
Interviewer: Did you remember your mother talking about him very muc h, what 
kind of person he was?
 
 
Moise We iner:Well, he was a person about whom, sort of a taboo, because he was 
ma rried not on a Jewess; and he drank vodka
.  It was a horror for the Jews if a 
Jew at that time drank Vodka --- not much.  But he was a builder painter.
 
 
Interviewer: He painted houses.
 
 
Moise We iner:Houses; and when he came
 from work, he took a glass of vodka, 
ma ybe a little glass of vodka.  It was a very terrible deed fr om the point  of view of 
my mother.  She survived.
 
Interviewer: His wife did?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  I saw her after the 
war; I was a kid.  I wanted to know his 
fate.  I reme mbered the address where sh
e lived, and I went to her and asked her 
about his fate; and she couldn™
t tell me  anything at all.
 
 

Interviewer: She didn™t know for certai
n.  You told me  the story about what 
happened to him.
 
 
Moise We iner:He was called to, ma ybe to, 
not exactly to the fighting army, but he 
was called to the army.  It was called ba
ttalions, building batt
alions; battalions 
that earthworks and so on.
 
 
Interviewer: Like the engineering battalion or something?
 
 
Moise We iner:Engineering battalion, yes; he 
was called to that.  He was a painter.  
He was called to that battalion, and when they were surrounded by the Germans 
and kept like war prisoners, they were or
dered to stay in a lin
e, or two lines; I 
don™t know exactly.  Another witness told a
bout his death to my 
elder brother; he 
stood beside him.
 
 
Interviewer: He was right besi
de your uncle when he died?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.  He was standing in 
that line.  And when the command was, 
‚commi ssars and Jews step out three step
s,™ they stepped out.  They didn™t know 
why they did that.  The command was ma ke with them, how to say it in English?  

[He says some thing in Yiddish.]
 
Interviewer: Get fi nished with 
them or ma ke an end of them.
 
 
Moise We iner:Make an end of them.  
One of his compatriots standing there 
rushed out from the line, took off his ba
ndage, and with that band he strangled 
him from be hind --- and strangled him.  
That was how he died.  That was the 
story.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you know when 
that happened, was that 1941?
 
 
Moise We iner:It was 1941.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you know where he was cap
tured?   No?  Just some where in the 
Ukraine?
 

 
Moise Weiner:Somewhere; it™s under Ki
ev, because it was not fa r from Kiev.
 
Interviewer: It was near  Kiev?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember anything a
bout your mother™s fa mily; about how 
ma ny brothers and sisters she had?
 
 
Moise We iner:Yes, because I reme mber it ve ry well.  Because I don™t know how 
it™s in your fa mily, but in our fa mily it 
was the cult of Mach
la™s relatives.  He 
liked them very much, and the love of my 
mother to her sisters, to her brothers, 
were given to the children; and to the re
latives of my father we were not so –
 
 
Interviewer: Not as close.
 
 
Moise We iner:Yeah, not as close.  So they were six, three si st ers and three 

brothers.
 
 
Interviewer: Where did your uncle fall 
in that?   Was he the oldest or the 
youngest brother?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no, the eldest was my mo
ther™s sister --- her mother (they are 
looking at photographs) --- Gittel.  Her name  was Gittel (?).
 
 
Interviewer: This is Gittel?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, this is Rosa; she was 
a very beautiful gi
rl.  She was gassed 
before the wa r in Vinnytsya; she was a very 
beautiful girl.  It™s
 a photo, but in real 
life she was very nice.  Gittel had th
ree daughters; she was the youngest.  Two 
elder da ughters of Gittel we
re married, and one had two children, and the other 
had one.  They had husbands, very nice 
guys, both; and they were killed in 

Odessa.
 

 
Interviewer: The husbands were killed in
 Odessa, or she was killed in Odessa?
 
 
Moise We iner:The whole family was killed;  my aunt, her husband, her daughters, 
her granddaughters.  It was in Odessa.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you know how she died?
 
 
Moise We iner:No; they were killed –
 
 
Interviewer: They were just captured by the Germans?
 
 
Moise Weiner:Germans --- the mass killings, the mass killings.
 
 
Interviewer: Can you tell me , Gittel a
nd her husband, what did her husband do, 
do you reme mber, for a living?
 
 
Moise We iner:He worked at a plant; he was a steel worker.
 
 
Interviewer: Do you remember what plant he worked at?
 
 
Moise We iner:Well, I don™t exactly reme mb
er, but I reme mber he presented us 
with knives that he did at work; when
 he was, as a guest, you know.  But his 

daughters we re educated and their sons-i
n-law, the husbands of the daughters, 
were too educated.  They had high education.  One was a teacher ma ybe, the other 

I don™t remember.  I do not reme mb er; I would not say.
 
 
Interviewer: So Rosa was not ma rried, though?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no, she was 17; she was in the tenth form.
 
 

Interviewer: Do you remember when she was born?
 
 
Moise We iner:If she was 17 in ™40; ™23 ma ybe.
 
 
Interviewer: And she was born in Odessa?
 
 
Moise We iner:She was born, I don™t know.
 
Interviewer: But she wasn™t born in Vakhnovka?
 
 
Moise We iner:Vakhnovka, I think no.  Or ma ybe she was born in Vakhnovka; I 
will not say.
 
 
Interviewer: Ithinkthat
™s all my questions.  Do we have anybody else?
 
 
Moise We iner:Well, the younger brother, Ra
fael (ph?) Liebowitz (? ), [different 
last name?] was killed with
 his family, of my mother.
 
 
Interviewer: Your mother™s brother.
 
 
Moise We iner:My mother™s brother, the 
younger brother.  He had two sons and a 

daughter.  He  and his wife and the whole family of his wife was killed in 

Lipovets; and one of the brot
her with my grand-dad, her brothers, was killed and 
his son, his wife, three daughters; very
 ma ny people died, were killed in 
Vakhnovka.  He was buried alive, I wa s told; 
that fa mily was buried alive.  They 
were thrown into the ground. 
 
 
Interviewer: Oh, is this the person you
™re talking about who was buried alive?
 
 
Moise We iner:No, no.  I talk about his br
other.  His brother was the father of 
these; my gr and-dad.  He was killed too.  So
 it™s a long story to 
tell.  It™s about 60 
people.  I can™t name  you by myself.
 
 

Interviewer: I think we talked about 
everybody.  Is there anybody else?   We did 
your parents; we did Rosa.  I ma y call you.  Is that okay?
 
 
Moise We iner:What can I sa y?  The only th
ing I want to save, the me mory of my 
parents.  That is all I want
 to say, the me mory of thos
e who were killed.  I stayed 
alive; I™m thankful.  If I would have 
been a religious ma n, I would say, ‚thank 
God I™m alive.™  I™m alive and that™s the be
st prize in my life.  I had my life during 
the war, after the war; hard or not har
d, it™s everybody.  But I™
m alive.  My little 
sister is killed.  She would have been 
now about 60.  She had no life.  My parents 
were killed.  My mother was a very y
oung–  I™m older than my father now; he 
was killed 56 year.  My mother was 
49.  They were young people.  My Uncle 
Isaac was 45.  Rafael was ma ybe in his 30™s or  maybe 40.  Gittel was a little 

older, but Rosa was 17.  They were young pe
ople, my brothers and cousins and so 
on.  So if there is any possi
bility to keep the me mory 
about them, not about me .  I 
have my own me mory, but they cannot say nothing.  I can say for them 

some thing, not very much.  Therefore, if you can have their name s in you 

museum that people shall reme mber them, 
I woul d be quite gr
ateful; that™s all.
 
 
Interviewer: [something in Yiddish]
 
 
Moise Weiner:[same thing in Yiddish]
