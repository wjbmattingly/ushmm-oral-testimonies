apartm ent at thefactory.  
 
 
In May, 1940, Germany in vaded France andoccupied Paris. T he Garihf am ily f led south,but 
they soon returned toParis, where they were subjectedto France'snew anti
-
Jewish legisla tion. In 
1943, Albert'sf ather was deported to aforced labor camp,and Albert's motherand the children wen
t 
into hiding with Madame Galop andher husbandfor the next six m onths. W hen they returned home 
in 1944,police were sent to arrest theGarihs,butagreed to say instead thatthef am ily was nothom e 
if  thefam ily would leave imm ediately.  
 
 
Albert was placed inaCatholic boarding schoolf or boys, andhis sisters in onefor girls, in a 
northeastern suburbof Paris. W hen Paris wa s liberated in August 1944, Albert'smother was able to 
bring her childrenback to the city.  Claire andher children are shown together in thisphotograph.  
Albert'sf ather, releasedf rom  the labor cam p, walked f rom Belgium to Paris, returning tohis fam ily in 
September 1944 on Rosh Hashanah,the Jewish new year.  
 
T he Garihf am ily rem ained in France after the war.  Albert received his baccalaureate 
degree in1957, then earneda degree inEnglish and Spanish to French translationf rom  the School 
of  AdvancedT ranslation and Interpretation Studiesat the Sorbonnein 1962, and imm ediately began 
his career intranslation, which he continuesto thisday 51 years later.  His early work was  translation 
of  scientif ic and technical documentsand publicationsand latertranslation of political and econom ic 
docum ents.  
 
 
Albert's work took him  f rom  France to Cam eroon in Af rica, to Morocco, and
 
then eventually to 
the UnitedStates. The organizationsf or which he worked included,am ong others, the International

Am erican Development Bank, T heW orld Bank,and the United 
Nations. His work withW orldBank brought him  toW ashington, DC in 1976.  His current consulting 
work is f or the United Nations. 
 
 
In 1967 Albert married Marcelle Ohayon, whohadm ovedto Francefrom  Morocco in 1960.  
Albert and Marcelle have three daughters, Judith, Dalia and Noem i. Their t
hree daughters have 
gi ven them  10 grandchildren, ages18 years to 18 months.  I'd like to acknowledge that Noem i is here 

with her father. W ould you raise your hand?T hank you. 
 
 
For pleasure, Albert describes him self  asa real m ovie buff , loves photography and to read,

Albert Garih.  
 
[Applause]
 
 
Albert, thank youf or joining us andfor your wi llingness to be our 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today.  You have 
so much to share with us, and just an hour, so we'll just jum p right into it.  Letm e start off,Albert, 
asking about yourf am ily.  And what you can tell us about yourf am ily and their comm unity, what their 
lif e was like bef ore thewar? W ar began, of course, whenGermany invaded Poland, Septem ber

1939, then Nazi Germany would invade France thef ollowing May of 1940.  You were just 2 years old 
at that tim e.  So you were very young.  T ellus what you canabout yourf am ily prewar.  
 
>> Albert Garih: OK.My parents were born in Constantinople, which is now Instanbul, inTurkey, at 
thebeginning of the century, in the 20th century, and they belongedto a Jewish f am ilies. They were 
--
 o
n m y mother's side, they were descendants of  people thathad been expelledf rom  Spain in 1492 
during the inquisition.  
 
 
My f ather, his ancestors camef rom  Iraq. They were both living in T urkey.  T hey bothm oved to 
France in 1923, af ter the FirstW orldW a
r. Turkey, which was partof  the Ottom an Em pire, the 
Ottom an Em pirehad sided with Germ any in the FirstW orldW ar, and asa retributionat the end of the 
war, the VersaillesT reaty signed in 1919, the Ottom an Em pire wasdism antled. W hat was lef t was 
T u rk
e y.   
 
 
T hen came this statesm an who createdm odernT urkey, which was a secular country, actually.  
At that tim e, the Jews were a bit concerned of  whatm ight be in storef or them, becausethey'd seen, 
they'd witnessed, the genocide of the Arm enians at the beginning of the century, and when theTurks 
cam e topower to create thism odernTurkey, the Greeks were livin g i n one of the port citieson the 
AegeanSea. T hey we re also expelledf rom  Izm ir, and they went toGreece,they went back to 
Greece.  
 
 
So the Jews were a bit concerned. T hey said,W hat is going to happen to us?  A lot of them  
decided to leave at that time. T hat's whatm y m otherand m yf atherdid. They met in Paris a couple 

years later. T hey moved to France in1923, in Paris,and they m et in 1927, and they m arried in 1928. 
And I was born10 years later, but bef ore m ysisters were born in1930 and1933.

My f ather was an accountant. He was workin g in the garmentf actory, doing thepay of  the
 
--
 
thepayroll of the em ployees. T hey were struggl ing, you know, with three children. It wasnoteasy.  
At that tim epeople were not making a lot of money, and it was very h ard.  My father was strugglin g 
two jobs at the same tim e.  He was working f ull tim e in thatfactory during theday, and inthe eveni
n g 
he was selling tickets in movie theaters inParis.  
 

 
Onearrangementthatm y f atherhad made wi th hisemployer, who was also Jewish actually, 
was f or ustom ove into the janitor's apartment of thef actory.  So we were living there until 1942.  
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:  Albert, you described yourf ather tome as very sm art, but very much self
-
educated.  
And yourm other was quite educated. Tell us about yourm other too.  
 
>>
 
Albert Garih:  My mother, she wentto school longer than m yf ather.  My f ather hadto start working 
at a very young age tohelp his parents in Turkey.  My m otherm anaged 
--
 
she went to school, so did 
m y f ather, actually, becausethey were bothfluent in French. T hey'd beeneducated. The university 
was sort of an organization who opened schools, public schools,all over the Ottom an Empire, in 
Egypt, in T urkey, everywhere, andm y parents were educatedthere in Instanbul. They wer e perfectly 
f luent in French.  For them, it was a naturaldestination when they decided tom ove to go to France, 
rather than any other country. T hat's how they endedupthere.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Albert, as you said, your parents I think were married in 1928, 10 years later you're 

born in1938. You described to me that1938was a particularly om inous yearf or your parents and 
other Jews, certainly.  T ell us a little bitaboutthat.  
 
>> Albert Garih: I think, besides the war, 1938 was the worst of allyears, actually.  It started 
with  th e 

annexation of Austria by Germ any.  Hitler was born in Austria.  He was not Germ an; he was Austrian.  

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

T hef irst thing hedid was annex Austria,tomake Austria part of theReich.  T hat was thef irst m ove, 
in March 1938.  
 
 
In September 1938, he convened a conference in Munich with the Frenchforeign m inister and 
the British prim e m inister, Neville Cham berlain, andheprom ised, Hitler prom ised that if  hewas 
allowed to occupy the land that was part of what isnow the CzechRepublic, actually, if  he w
a s 
allowed to swallow this  land, there would be peace, he wouldn't go any f urther.  
 
 
So Chamberlain,the British prim em inister, who was ver y naive, believed him and he went 
back to England saying, "Wehave peace inour time." W ell, that was September 1938.  In 

September 1939, thewar broke out whenthe Germ ans marched into Poland.  
 
 
So that was the second bad thing that happened in 1938. T he third one was Kristallnacht, the 
night of broken glass.  If you have visited them useum , youm usthave seen something about that on 
thefourthf loor. T herewas a young Jew f rom Germ any, livin g in France, in Paris, who hadheardhis 
parents had been moved to the eastern border with Poland, tothePolish border of Germany, and he 
was ver y upsetabout that, and in retaliation he killed a juniordiplomat, Germ an diplomat in Paris.  
T hat signaled to Hitler to unleash his Storm Troopersandhisf olks intoa ram pageonKristallnacht.  
T hey killed 91people. They destroyed synagogues. T hey destroyed businesses, shops,bui
ld in gs ,  
apartm ents andto add insult to injury they forced the Jews to payf or the clean
-
up and to do the 
clean
-
u p.   
 
 
So that was really an inauspicious year.  Usually when I talk, to show that I am  a bitoptim istic I 
say I was born in 1938, m yf irst daughter was born the year that men walked onthe moon, 1969. I 
think that was abig stepforward.

>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, thef ollowing year,  Septem ber,Germany invades Poland,W orldW ar II 
begins, thenof  course the following spring, in May of  1940, Germ any invades Paris, then occupies 
France, then occupies Paris.  Yourf am ily with, I believe, asm uch as80% of the population lef t Paris 
in what is known as the exodus.  You said tom e, I believe your wor ds, it allbegan with the exodus? 
 
>> Albert Garih: That's where we were f irst really directly aff ectedby the war.  T here was already 

som e discrim inatem aneuvers against the Jews.  For instance, m yfather, I startedthe process of  
naturalization. T hey im m igrated in1923,and in 1939 they still didn't have the French citizenship.  So 
ever ything was f rozen.  There was already som eanti
-
sem itism  in France, so it was not easy.  
 
In 1939, when the war broke out, when the Germ ans marched intoPoland, according to 
the Munich conf erence it hasbeen said that if they m arched intoPoland, that would be war. T hey 
m arched into Poland on Septem ber 1,1939,andSeptem ber3, France andBritain declared war on 
Germ any.  The trouble was that they were ill equipped. T hey were notarmed like the Germ ans. W e 
didn't have
 
these Autobahns, the freeways Hi tler builtfor a very specif ic strategy, purpose, to be able 
tom ove troops around in the country.  In France we had 12 m iles of f reeway coming outof Paris at 

th a t tim e.  T ha t's a ll.  
 
 
So yes, in 1939, whenwar broke out,
 
nothingchanged imm ediately for us. It's only in 1940, 
af ter Hitler, who was a ver y shrewd guy, who signed a pact with Stalin, to make sure Russia would 

not react when they invaded Poland, they wo uld make sure they shared Poland, the western part 
go i n g t
o Germany, theeastern part of Polandto Russia, thenhe decidedto invade the whole of  
W estern Europe.  He started with Norway, De nm ark, Netherlands, Belgium , Luxem bourg and France.  

France was only invaded, only thenorthern part was invaded.  Butwhen t
he German soldiers

m archedon the Champs Elysees in Paris, the peopleof Paris panicked andf led, and thatwas the 
exodus, what we call in French le exod,andever ybody took to the roads, someby train, som e by car.  
T hat's wherem y m other lost her mother,
 
herbrother, her sister and nephews when a bombf ell on 
their car on thebridge, thebridge over the river south of France, not even 100m iles southof  Paris. 
 
 
W e wentdown to the river where m y m other lost her relatives, andm y m other toldm e, 
because 
I have no recollection, I was just 2 years old in June1940,that we slept in a chateau. There 
were chateaus. T he river is f am ousf or thebeautiful chateaus thatare all around the river . T hey're 
m agnif icent. W e slept in one of these chateaus.  It was notexactly i n a beautif ulbed or anything like 
that. W e were sleeping on thef loor.  My m other had nothing tofeed me. I was alwa ys cr ying, 
because I was hungry.   
 
 
My m other toldm ealso an anecdoteabout that. At onepoint, I wascrying so much, and 
I  was  
preventing everyone f rom  sleeping, so a soldier was there, some soldiers had managed not to be 

taken prisoner and toflee with the peopleof Paris, and there was one soldier there who gave her 
som e schnapps.  Said, " Give him  some schnapps.  It will calm  him down."   It did.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Here you f led with literally tens of  thousands, if nothundreds of thousands,of  people.  
Your m other lost hermotherand otherf am ily m em bers. W here didyou endupaf ter you lef t Paris? 
 
>>
 
Albert Garih: W ell,we stayed in the chateaufor afew days.  I couldn't tell you whether it was a 
week, two weeks; I have no idea.  Eventually, we hadnowhere else to go,eventually we wentback 
home.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Back to Paris?

>> Albert Garih:
  
Yes. Some people tried to go through
 
--
 
France was divided, and there was a 
demarcation linedividing theoccupied zonefrom  thef ree zone. W ell, also what Iforgot tom ention is 
that in June, June 20, France signeda separatearm istice with Germ any.  T hatmeans that we were 
no longer at war, supposedly, but we were occupied. T here was a governm ent that set upshop in 
thef ree zoneof  France in VichY, just below the demarcation line. That governm ent was 
collaborating, and actively collaborating, with the Germ any occupiers.  
 
 
W hen th e  r ou n d
-
ups started in 1941, those conducting these round
-
ups were thepolice, 
French police, not theGerm ans.  You have a couple of movies thatcam e out two, three years ago, 
onethat tells the story about this big round
-u
p that took place in July 1942. T here was another one, 
which was really f ocused on that round
-
up, which was "T he round
-
up,"  in French.  It describes these 
episodes where 13,000 Jews were roundedup inParis, including 4,000 children.  Exceptfor two, 
t h re
e whom anaged toescape beforethey were senttothe cam ps,4,000 ended up in the cam ps, 
none of them  came back.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter the return to Paris,thefam ily goes back to Paris, you would stay in your 
apartm ent until 1942.  T ell us what you can
 
about that two
-
year period, then what led tothe events 
thatforced you to leave Paris at thatpoint, or leave your apartm ent. 
 

>> Albert Garih: In1941, the collaborationist governm entadaptedwhat they called theStatute of the 
Jews, which were based on the Nurem berg Laws that were discriminatory against the Jews in 
Ge rm an y.  
 
 
So we were not allowed to goto theaters, wewere not allowed in public transportation. The 
lawyers were debarred.  The doctors were not allowed to practice. Itwas a lot of  restrictions, a lot of  

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

11
 
discrim ination against the Jews in France. T hat started in 1941.  Also myf ather was workin g in a 
factory thatbelonged to a Jew, so it must have beenat that time organized. T hey would conf iscate 
thefactory and give it to an Aryan, to anon
-
Jew, to run.  Myf ather's employer was a Jew, andhehad 
to leave hisfactory like that.  
 
 
At thatpoint, Im entioned that we were livin g i n the janitor's apartment of thef actory, we had to 
leave that apartment.  W e had to m ove f rom  that apart
m ent. Innotim e, we had to f ind som ething, 
and wef ound a very sm all apartm ent.  It was only two room s,nottwo bedrooms, two rooms.  A tiny 
kitchen, a toilet,and that was it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Noteven a bathtub? 
 
>> Albert Garih: Bathtub? No. That wouldhave been a luxury.  Not even a shower.  Really, it was 
the very basic.  So we had tom ove. W edid that in July 1942.  In the summer of 1942 
--
 
as  I  
m entioned before, the round
-
ups had startedin 1941 in France. T hey didn't start sending the Jews
 
to  
the camps until I think it was 1943, but they were held ina transit cam p in anorth suburb,northern 
suburbof Paris.  Andm y parents were ver y concernedabout that,andthey wantedf irstto keep us 
saf eby not staying at home,becauseof  thedanger of being rounded up.  
 
 
Also, they wanted usto be betterfed,because they hadnothing to
 
--
 
you know, ever ything 
was restricted.  All we hadaccessto was stale bread, sometimes they m ixed with thef lour, tom ake it 
m ore consistent.  It was dark bread, stale, hard.  If we were lucky we  would f ind a couplepotatoes.  
An egg was a luxur y item .  One egg, not adozen.  So it was ver y rar e, very hard for them tof eedus.  
So they decided to send us to af arm  notfarf rom Paris in a small town, where today there
 
is a park 
there. In those days it was nothing of the sort.

Anyway, we went tothat farm . There were two ladies.  I rem em ber thetwo ladies in thatfarm .  
I remember thenam eof  the landlady was Madame Achtouise.  My sisters would go to school.  I was
 
too young. I was 4 years old. I stayedhom e with the two ladies. I rem ember that winter, it was a 
ver y cold winter.  T here was a lotof  snow.  I rem ember Christmas there, and I remem beractually 
when I hear a song that brings m e back there.  That's where I heard that songf or thef irsttim e.  
Anyway, we stayed there for the winter and the spring of 1942
-
43.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents were still in Paris?  
 
>> Albert Garih:  My parents were still in Paris. T hey were concerned,but they stayed in th
e 
apartm ent. They couldn't com e with us.  Butm y parents had not told the ladies, MadameAchtouise 
andher sister, I think, that we were Jewish.  Oneday in a conversation, I was 4 years old,talking to 
the ladies,I told them that we were Jewish.  That's
 
all ittookf or the lady to sendus right back to our 
parents. T hey didn't want to have anything to do with that. So they sentus back to ourparents.T hat 

was in the spring of 1943.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're back now livin g in that sm all
 
--
 
>> A l b
ert Garih: In that sm allapartm ent,facing thedanger of imm inentarrest anddeportation.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou shared with me an incident your m othertold you about, because every 

tim e you wentout, of  course, you were very m uch at riskare of b
eing rounded up.  There was an 
incident. T ell us about that.  
 
>> Albert Garih: W e were not 
--
 
as Imentioned bef ore, we were not allowed to takepublic 
transportation. T hat was dangerous. I don'tknow whether it was really that we were not allowed, bu
t 
it was ver y dangerous, becausethey were doing identity checks onpeople com ing out of the trains.

Oncem y m other hadto run anerrand in Paris while m y sisters were at school. T hey wer e 
older thanm e, sothey were going to school. My m other would rather keepm e athom e.  4 years old, 
5 years old, it was not mandatory f orm e to go to school.  It was dangerous to send children to school, 
because sometimes they would go tothe schools and round up thechildren and the parents would 
never see their children again. It was dangerous. Som y m other keptm e hom e. 
 
 
T hat day she hadto run an errand in Paris. W ehad totake the Metro. W e tookthe Metro.  On 
m y wa y back, we were  at the end of the line.T here was an identitycheck.  I have no recollection 
of  
that.  My m other told me thatm any,m any years later.  She knew wh at itm eant, because the French 

--
 
the Jews had a big J on their identity cards.  So if they saw us in the train with a J on the card, 
they'd put usasideand send us tothe transit camp.
  
The transit cam p was the platf orm  to go to 
A u sch wit z.   
 
 
Som y m other heldm e in herarm s. She looked inher purse and she walked between, 
whether it was thepolicem en,m ust have been, because the policem en were notas badas the 
m ilit ia m en .   T h e  m ilit i
am en were vehem ently anti
-
Sem itic and would nothave sparedher. T hese two 
policeman, they let her go through,or didn't realize.  She walked through the two policem en, and we 

were saf e.  If one of them asked to seeher papers, I wouldn't be here today.  It was a very close call. 
W ehad a couple close calls like that during thef our
-
year period of the war.

>> Albert Garih:  Yeah, in Septem ber 1943, my f ather was sent to aslave labor cam poff  the coast of 
Norm andy in the small islands, called the Channel
 
Islands, which we re the only British possession 
that was occupied by the Nazis.  Hitler wanted to invade Great Britain, but he never succeeded in 

doing that. So theonly territory, the only Britis h territory, thathemanaged to occupy were these 
s m a ll is
lands off the coast of Normandy in France.  
 
 
So they were building the Atlantic wall that was supposed to stop aninvasionf rom the Allied 
forces.  My father was there with 900 detainees. T here were several cam ps on that island. He was 
in the worst of them, which was for the Jews.  There were people, Spanish politicalprisoners, in one 
of  the cam ps, and so they were in the worst one.  
 
 
He spent,not quite, about seven, eightm onths in that cam p building. W hile he was therehe 
hada big accident.  He was carr ying a trough full of  cementonhis head, on the scaffolding, and he 
steppedona loose board, and theboard cam e right to hithim onthe head, andhefell off a cliff .  He 
was picked upby the truck a couple hours later, I don't know, and he was sewn. W henmy mother 
heardaboutthat accident, shethought that was the lasttim e
 
--
 
we would never see him  alive again.  
 
 
My f ather was very str ong.  He was much stronger than Iam , andhe survi ved that. But 
anywa y, in them eantim e, m y m otherfoundherself  alone athom ewith three young children, with a 
constant threat of being rounded up and taken away.  She was terrified about this idea, which is 
understandable, actually.  One day, som ehow, shem et a lady in a streetmarket.  In France we have 
stre e t m a
rkets where you buy the vegetables, whatever you couldf ind in those days, which was not 
easy.  She met this lady, and som ehow shefelt she could openupto this lady, and shetold her her 

story, that she was terrified they could come at any m omentto takeus away.

T his lady, Madam eGalop, went home,and she told her husband the story about us. T henext 
day, her husband came with the cart.  He was pulling.  He took whatever personaleffectswe could, 
andthey took us with them and we lived with them f o
r about six, seven m onths.  T hat was in the f all 
of  1943, and we stayed with them  until the spring of 1944.  
 
 
T he Galopshad two daughters. I was 5 at that time,and the daughters were 4 and 3. Sofor 
m e it was a great time, becauseI was too young to be af raid or to realize the danger or anything like 
that. T he only thing I was suffering f rom  was the lack off ood,but otherwise I was not
 
--
 
and I hada 
great tim e, because Ihad two com panions wit h whom  I was playing, and Mr.
 
Galops was a sculptor, 
m a ki
ng setsf or them ovie studios. T hey hada big warehousebehind their house, where they were 
storing all of  these sets.  W e had greathide
-
an d
-
seekpartiestherewith the two little girls.  
 
 
For m e it was f ine. It was a happy
 
--
 
probably the happiest time I had during that period was 
when we were at the Galops'. TheGalops were absolutely adorablepeople.  Monsieur Galop was 

ver y handy, m aking toys f or us, piggybank.  I rem em ber alsoa plaster ball thathe m adefor us. W e 
felt really at home with them . 
 
It was wonderf ul in that respect.  
 
 
T hat doesn'tm ean that when they had visitors we had to be careful. So we would go into the 
back room , m y motherwould hushm e like that, and said "Shhh."  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa great risk tothe Galops todotha
t.  
 
>> Albert Garih: It was.  Ifthey had been caught, we would have been taken away, but they m ight 
have been taken away too, and their childrentoo. So not only a danger f or them selves, but for their 
children. These people, to me,are incredible. You
 
know, the war brought out of  thepeople thebest 
andthe worst.  Theseare an exam ple of thebest that you canf ind in people.

So we spent about six m onths,and we would have stayed longer,but they were living in
 
--
 
it  
was a sm all street,private houses,andeachone was occupied by an artist. You hadpainters, 
sculptors. One of the painters, his wif e wasa sym pathizer of the Germ ans, andprobably 
anti
-
Sem itic. Although, she likedm e. I rem em berhaving a nicem om ent with her. One day she 
asked Madam eGalop, "When are you going to get rid of that scum?"   
 
 
So at that tim e, Madam e Galop andm y m other decided it was saf er for us to go back home.  
W hich we did.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Back to your place in Paris?  
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes.  It was a suburb,actually.  T he Galops also lived there,because they m et in 

th e  m a rket, stree t m a rke t the re .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Go back to your apartment?  
 
>> Albert Garih: W e wentback to our apartment, yes. Sureenough, afew weeks later we hadthe 

vis it  o f  t wo  p o lic e
 
inspectors.  Knocked at the door at 8:00 in them orning.  I was still in bed.  My 
sisters m ust have been up preparing to go to school. T wo police inspectors knocked at the door.  

" Madam e Garih?"   
 
 
" Yes?"   
 
 
"W e cam e to take you away."   
 
T ha t ' s  on e of  th
em omentsm y m other was dreading. She started shaking like that. 
T hey said, " Don't worry.  W e're not going totake you away. W e'regoing to report we didn'tf ind you, 
but you cannot stay here.  You have tof indaplacefor riding again."  
 
 
So the inspectors lef t, andm y m otherdressed me up. I was still in bed.  I was awakenedby

thenoiseof  thetwo inspectors. My m other dressedm e up imm ediately, and we went out. She went 
to see a social worker that she knew, and she explained. She said, "You have
 
to f ind a place f or us."   
T he social worker said, " You know what?  I'll dom y best,butI cannotf ind som ething overnight. Inthe 

m eantim e,try to see if  you can sleep at yourneighbor's or
 
--
 
but don't sleep in your apartm ent."  
 
So that's what we did.  
W e slept at our next
-
door neighbor, a couple of  comm unist 
workers actually.  One daughteraboutm y age, threem onths younger than me,and they were 
workin g at night, so the night shift.  So during thenight we were sleeping in theirbed. W hen they 
com e back in them orning, we'd get up and leave them  the bed.  
 
 
Mr.
 
Miniterie hadbeencalled to go to the Ministry of  LaborService in Germany and had not 
reportedf orduty, sohe was also wantedby the Germ ans,andby the Gestapo. T hey were  also ina 
dangerou
s situation, but they tookus, at least m y m otherand I. My sisters stayed downstairs at the 
lodge keeper's apartment, a wom an with three young children.  Herhusband had been taken 
prisoner, was partof  the French arm y that were roundedupby theGerm ans
 
when the French 
capitulated in June1940.  
 
 
W esleptaf ew nights like that,until eventually the social worker told m y mother," Ifound a 
placefor each oneof  you."  So she placedmy m otheras a governess in afamily with seve ral 

children,eight 10, Idon't remem berhow m any, but abunch of children near theEiff elT ower.  
 
W e were placed in Catholic boarding schools, in a suburb east of Paris, called 
Montf erm eil, which was m adefam ous in "Les Miserables"  where Cosette lived,and that'swhere Jean 
V a lje
an meets Cosette when she goes to getwater.  T hat's in Montferm eil. That's wherewe were, 
there, Montfermeil.  Itwas a Catholic boarding school.

I remember thatthe headm istress was ver y nice with m e. I was theyoungest.  I was just6.  
You had childrenf rom 7 up to14there.  Shem usthave been the only one who knew about m y 
situation asa hidden child in that school, actually.  She was ver y m otherly with m e.  She was always 
holding m y hand.  I was her protege.  
 
 
T he only thing that was bad there was thefood. It was terrible.  Really, it was so bad thatI 
was sick all the time. Wespent the summ erof  1944. T he summ erof  1944 was particularly hot.  I 
rem em ber that. W espentm ost of the time, itwas the sum mer, so we went to class maybe 
o cca sio na
lly, and I remem ber when I was atthe Galops',I hadnothing else to do, so I learnedto read 
and write.  I could read.  I rem em ber I was ver y proud the day that I could readaf ullpage. Don't ask 

m e what it was about, I have no idea, but I could decipherevery wor d on the page.  So I could read.  
Since I was the youngest, andthere were people who could not read in that school, they putm e in 
the class with the babies, and I was m aking strokes like this. W hereas, I couldhave written anywa y.  
B u t so it 
was notexactly a glorious tim e staying in that school, but it saved our lives.  I rem em ber 
seeing m y sisters. W e would go to church every Sunday.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere hidden in adiff erentplace?

Albert Garih: InaCatholic boarding schoolf or girls.  I was in the Catholicboarding schoolf or 
boys, in the sam eplace, in Montf erm eil. W e'd go tothe sam e church on Sunday morning,to Mass. 

T hat's where I'd see my sisters.

she couldnot com municate with

>> Bill Benson:  Did she even know where you were?  
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes, she knew where we were, because that's where, actually, we witnessed the 
liberation.  One day 
--
 
I have to give you oneanecdote also. W e used to go play. T here was a road 
nearby, and we'd go to play in the woods.  One day there was a raid, air raid with the sirens blasting.  

W eknew we had to run back tothe sheltersat that tim e.  W e were in the woods. W e'd run back to 
the schools. T he next day we heard that we're in the clearing in theforest, in the sm all wood there, it 
m ay be the wood where Cosette wasf etching thepail of water.  It could have been.  
 
 
T he place where we were, there was a big hole by a bom b that hadfallen inthe place
 
we  
were. W e rushed back, and it was ver y dangerous. TheAllied landing hadtaken place inNorm andy.  
T here were air raids, Germ an planes,American planesf ighting over our heads. W eused to go tothe 
shelters. I was telling Bill bef ore we started,one
 
of m y hobbies during that tim e was to collect 
shrapnel.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou got theall clear, you'd goupand collectshrapnel?  
 
>> Albert Garih:  Yes.  You'd com eoutof  shelter atthe end of the air raid.  At the endof  the raid we'd 

go in the
 
schoolyard, and that was one of ourhobbies. I was notthe only one. W e were picking up 
the shrapnel.  I had awhole collectionof  them  when I cam ehom e. 
 

 
Oneday, I did runaway.  Ever ybody was ver y nervous about that,because it was ver y 
dangerous. 
 
It was still war, you know.  He cam eback thenext morning saying " T heAllies are

com ing."  
 
 
I don't know where hehad been,butapparently he got that inform ation. As soonas we heard 
that, we went down the Main Street,and we saw all the tanks, all the Jeeps, the soldiers.  For thef irst 
tim e it wasf riendly soldiers.  It was thef irst tim eI'd ever heard about Am ericans.  Ineverheardof  
Am ericans bef ore.  I knew about Italians, Russians, British, Germ ans of course, and French.  But 
Am ericans?  I'd n
ever heardof  these people. 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were glad to see them?  
 
>> Albert Garih: I was.  They gave m e chocolate.T hey even wanted to give me cigarettes.  But the 
headm istress was holding my leash very ti ght.  
 
[Laughter]
 
It wa s a  w
onderf ulm om ent. That's something that is hard to express, the explosionof  joy we have in 
our heart when that liberationhappened.  You see that inthe newsreels when you see thegirls 
jum ping on the tanks,kissing the soldiers.  Really, it was reall y liberation in every sense of the word.  
 
 
As soon as we were liberated, we were liberated probably a few days af terParis, becausewe 
were east of Paris. The troops were m oving east towards Germany.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  August?  
 
>> A lb e rt Ga rih : A u gust.  Pa
ris was liberated August 25,1944. W em usthave been liberatedm aybe 
one week later.  I don't know how long.  As soon as they restored train service, m y m otherwas on the 

f irst train, of course.  One day, I was sleeping
 
--
 
no, playing in the schoolyard.  It was ver y hot,as I 
said.  I was ver y weak, becauseI was underfed. I see m y sisters com ing.  T here was a side door on

there was a wall surrounding theplaygr ound of the school. There was a sidedoor.  Iseem y 
sist e rs sa y,  " G ue ss wh o 's h e re. "   
 
 
You know, a 6

year

old, I'd not seenm y m other f or threemonths.  I had almostforgotten about 
m y m other. I said, "W ho can thatbe?"  I had no idea.  Ihad topush m y sisters aside. W hen I saw 
m y m other, of course I jum ped intoher arm s. She was appalled to see how I was.  I was so skinny.  I 
was sick.  She decided to takem ehom e right away, the same day.  
 
 
I remember she had
 
--
 
ever ything we had tobuy with tickets.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ration cards?  
 
>>
 
Albert Garih: Exactly.  She bought a loaf of bread.  My younger sister, Gilberte, andm yself, we 
swallo wed the bread in no tim e. W e were constantly starved, actually.  
 

 
Som y m other tookm e home right away.  And for whatever reason, she couldn't take m
y 
sisters the sam eday, so she had to go back the next day.  She lef tm eunder the custody of  our 

neighbor, who hadthekey, who was checking onm eonce ina while.  There was nothing toeat in the 
house exceptfor a green apple. T hat's not exactl y the kind of dietthat I should havef ollowed at that 
tim e,but that's all I had.  Iate the greenapple.  Ihad hardly f inished the apple whenI heard the key 
in the door.  She saw m e, I was touching m y teeth. She said,"W hat did you eat?"   I said, " I didn'tea
t 
anything."   
 
 
" Yeah, youdid something."  
 
 
T hen she realized thatI had eaten this greenapple, which was ver y bad.  
 
Som y m other cam eback in theevening with  m y sisters.  Andm y father,m eanwhile m y 
father, who was on the Channel Islands,there had b

Channel Islands about a month bef ore, justam onth, May 7, 1944, am onthbefore D Day. They had 
been takento theStraits of  Dover.  You know, the Allies wanted theGerm ans to believe that the 
invasion couldtake place in the Strait of Dover, which is the place where the distance between Britain 
and France is short,I think 17 m iles, which is ver y sm all.  
 
 
So the Alliesused tobom b all thisarea.  Rem em ber m y m otheronce mentioning that they had 
bombed Bologna, which was right in the Strait of Dover.  How I remem berthat? I don't know.  T hat 
struck m y im agination. I heard Bologna. Sheprobably knew m y f ather was in Bolognaat that time. 
She was very concerned about that.  
 
 
My f atherand 900 detainees were sent to the Straitof  Dover to repair thefortif ications, which 
were constantly destroyed by the Alliedbom bings.  In early Septem ber, probably early Septem ber, 
they were put on atrain boundf or Germany, probably f or slave labor, another slave laborfactory, or
 
m aybefor exterm ination cam p.W e don't know about that.  
 
 
As they were traveling across Belgium, the Belgian resistance, theunderground,had blown up 
either thebridge or rail track, Idon't know, but the train was stopped there.  T here was some 

conf us
ion, some battles between the Germans and the resistance,and eventually the Germans 
released all their prisoners, andm y father walked back home. T hatwas about200 m iles. W alked 

back home. It tookhim  between oneand two weeks, I would say.  
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  He was in really lousy condition.  
 
>> Albert Garih:  He was in very bad condition.  Hehad thisbadf all, and he died much later, buthe 
diedof  seizures.  I can't help thinking thatthese seizures that he had in thef inal years of his lif e were 
relatedtohis accident on this island.

Yeah, he walked all the way, and he was ver y skinny.  He arri ved on the morning of Rosh 
Hashanah, which is the Jewish new year.  My m other was dressing m e to goto synagoguef or the 
f irst tim e, af ter the war.  For
 
us,for all practical purposes, the war ended in August 1944, but actually 
the war ended May 8,1945.   I still remember that day too, becausewe were home and I was playing 

with m y f riends in abuilding, a lone building.  I used toplay with the kids and
 
running back and forth 
like that.  Around 11:00 in them orning, the siren announcing the end of  the war startedblasting.  I still 

rem em ber atthat time, I was with a f riend,and m yf riend was m uchfaster runner than me. Thatday I 
beat him.  I wasf irst
 
on the f inish line.  
 
[Laughter]
 
It's hard toexpress, but it was som ething thatwe had to get off our chest, and that's what happened.  
T hat's how I got the impetus tobeatm y f riend.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Albert, that was May 1945,but asI said the war wa s,f or all practical purposes,over 

for you and your sisters and your parents inSeptember 1944. W hat was that period like,though, to 
try to resum e life inParis, knowing there's still the war going on until the actual end of thewar in 
1945?  
 
>> A l b e r t
 
Garih: W hen we heard the war was  over, it was like som ething 
--
 
like a balloon that had 
blown up.  For us,for all practical purposes, we had resum ed a normal life.  I went to school in 
October 1944. I started elem entary school. I was just 6 years old.
  
I went to school,had a normal 
school year.  I think I was a good student. 
 
 
Not only wa y was I a good student, I was som otivated and happy to lead anormal lif eagain.  
Of course, we still had to rationf ood, we still had ticketsf orbread and alsofor all sorts of things, and

that lastedf oraf ew years af terthe war.  Af ter the war I was so skinny and weak that Ihad to bef ed 
cod liver oil.  I don't know if  you ever try to gi ve to your kids som e cod liver oil.  I don't thinkthey 
would have taken it
 
ve r y e a s i l y.  
 
 
W ell, I was swallowing.   It's likem y body needed that.  Idrank cod liver oil, and Ialmost loved 
it.  I also had UV rays, because I was lacking som e vitam in D,I guess, or these
 
--
 
lacking these 
suntanning parlors that people go to now to get a suntan. T hey putm eona bed,under a lam p to get 

UV rays, to develop, because I was really m alnourished, inother words.  It doesn't show, but I was at 
th a t tim e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Albert, we have a couple ofm inutes, I think,f ora couple of  qu
estions f rom  our 
audience, just af ew, because we're getting very close to the endof the program . W e'll see if  we can 
get a couple questions, perhaps. Im ay haveonem oref or you.W e're going to give you am ic.  
T hank you.W e've got a handup right there.W hen you get them ic,try to make the question asbrief  
as you can, and if I think that noteverybody heard it Im ay repeat itbefore Albert answers it.  But 
there you go. 
 
>> T hank you very m uch f or sharing your story with us.  Im yself ama citizenf rom Germ any and I 

hada lot of education about the Holocaust, the war crim es, throughoutmy school tim e.  My question 
to you is:  Over the years af terthe war, how did yourf eelings towar ds Germany and Germans 
develop, especially in the senseof forgive
ness af ter a few decades, and so on?  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is what are your feelings towards Germ any and Germ ans after the war 
andthe years and time since then?  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
25
 
>> Albert Garih: That's a very good question, and Im ust tell you Iam  going toanswer by stages.  
First, of  course, we hated the Germans. TheGerm ans
 
--
 
f irst of all,we didn't call them theGerm ans, 
we called them " le bushe," which I think in English is " theKrauts."  It is a very derogatory word to call 

Ge rm an s at tha t tim e . W e we
re very hostile, which is understandable, actually.  
 
 
W hen I was inm y early 20s I used to go to afarm  camp inEnglandto brush upmy English, 
and it was farm  camps open to studentsf rom all over Europe, and there were some Germ ans, and 
these were the children of the perpetrators.  I rem em ber that I didn't have much sym pathy for them , 
because If oundthem ver y arrogant.  They still
 
--
 
they could not
 
--
 
we couldn'teven talkabout the 
issue of the war.  It was taboo; we couldn'ttalk about it.  
 
 
I th in k i
t took two generations.  I don't know if you have heard about them ovie that cam eout in 
the1980s called "TheNasty Girl,"  a movie abouta young girl, 15, 16 years old in school. She starts 

scratching to try tof ind out, she asked her dad, " Dad, where was grandpa during the war?"
 
 
It took two generations to start.  
 
 
I thinkalsoanotherevent that really m ade abig im pact in Germ any was the presentationof  the 
m iniseries on the television, " Holocaust." T hat was in the late1970s, I think.  It was the same im pact 

on the Germanpopulation as" Roots" here, about slavery.  
 
 
People were literally tr aumatized by seeing it.  They said" My grandparents didthat?"
 
 
I thinktoday, today the Germansare totally differentf rom  the Germ ans of that period,and I 
t h in
k while you still have som e skinheadsand still have some neo
-
Nazis, but you have them  all over 
the world, so it'snot specif icto Germany.  
 
 
I remember there wasan anecdote
 
--
 
notanecdote, but an incidentthathappened in the 1980s 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

in Germany when aT urkish im m igranthad been killedby som e skinheads in Germ any.  And people 
were upsetfor the lack of reactionof  the governm ent,and there was a hugedemonstration in Bonn, 
at that tim ethe capital ofW est Germany, 
--
 
Iforgot thenam e. W estern Germ any, anyway.   There 
was a huge demonstration, like300,000 people, Germ ans, demonstrating to protest the lack of  

response on the part ofthe governm ent to the assassination of aTurkish imm igrant.  
 
 
I haven'theard anything like thathappening in France or inBritain, the sam e kindof  incident.  I 
don't know. SoI think the Germ ans have changed, andI think so. Today, I am a lotmore opentoa 
dialogue with the Germ ans, somuch so that I was telling Bill that I'm  going toEurope this summ er, 
andI plan to go to
 
Berlin.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe're
 
--
 
thank youf or thatanswer, and thankyou for that question. W e're 
going to wrap up in just one mom ent.  I just wantfolks to know that the Galopsand the Minetraires 
that you stayed with. You got them honoredlater. W ould you tell us that before we close.  
 
>> Albert Garih: I was having lunch with a colleague of m ine in the late 1980s,andI told her m y 
story.  She's an Israeli.  She said, "W hydon'tyou have them  recognized?"   I said," Inever heardof  
the p
rogram ."   She gave m e the nam e of theperson she knew in Jerusalem.  She said," You tell your 
story to that person. She's working on this and will get back to you." So through that person, I 
m anaged to have theGalops and the Minetraires recognized as ri

andI said I think this experience has made me an optim ist,because I have been

if I'm alive today, 
I'm  theproduct of the cooperation of the Protestantfam ily, the Galops, who were Protestan
t,  a  

comm unist couple,and the Catholic boarding school.  So Ihad thewhole spectrum  of people who

exactly a ver y good neighbor.

couple, a m iddle

Our sectionof  the balcony was separatedf rom  
theirs by a railing.  So she askedm y m other to pass me over the railing, and shetookme intoher

felt this lady was ver y nice and very f riendly.
