March 3, 2000 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: -- you thi -- what do
 you think of the weather, 
let™s talk about the weather. 
Answer: Living in Florida, 
it™s gorgeous. I me  -- it™s a God sent weather. Noth ing better 
than that. 
Q: Is it alw ays this nice? 

A: It™s always this nice, even
 wh en  it rains, it™s only liquid sunshine, so it™s pretty good. 
Should have come here before we ev
en was born, it™s -- to be born here. 
Q: This is your id ea of paradise? 

A: That™s -- I think that
™s -- want me to hold it? 
Q: No, I™ll hold it, it™s all right. 
A: Yeah? 
Q: Cause that™s [indecipherable] 

A: No. I think th ere™s a idea of paradise. 
[indecipherable] wonderful friends, and it keeps 
me busy. Matter of fact, I have to get up ev
ery mo rning 6:30, seven o™clock just to keep 
busy, cause I go to school five times a week. 

Q: Oh, you do? 

A: I sure do, sure do. And I lecture on the -- 
on Holo caust and German history. I don™t get 
paid for it, and plus I was a volunteer in an old age home, in an hospital, except I had to

stop it because I had a triple bypass, and a 
pacemaker, so I cannot do heavy lifting -- or 
very heavy lifting, so I stopped that. 
Q: Okay, let™s pause. United States Holo
caust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr 
collection. This is an interview with Beno 
Helmer, conducted on March third, 2000, by 
Arwin Donohue. This is a 
follow up interview to a vide
otaped interview that was 
conducted with Mr. Helmer, 
and this interview will focu
s on his post-Holocaust 
experiences. The videotaped in
terview focused on his Holo
caust era experiences. We 
may go back and -- and discuss some of th
e Holocaust era experiences that weren™t 

mentioned in the first intervie
w. This is tape number one, 
side A. And, Mr. Helmer, I 
thought we would start with 
the mo ment of your liberation, and -- and move forward 
from there, and we™ll see how -- how it goes, 
as far as going back 
before that. And you 
described in your first interview how you were
 -- the circumstances of your liberation, 
and how the am -- U.S. army came into th
e -- to the POW camp where you were. And I 
wondered -- you mentioned something about th
is moment of freedom, and I wondered if 
you would talk a little bit 
about what that -- what
 freedom meant to you. 
A: Let me regress a little bit. The day of -- 
when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I 
think to -- let™s say 24 hours before I was lib
er -- I was -- got the worst beating in my 
lifetime. [in d ecipherable] I st
ill have scars on my  head and my  shoulders, because the 
commander told us to march with
 him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him. 
So he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me
 mercilessly. And I gonna die, but I™d rather 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064

die instead of marching with him. Some hour
s later, down the road, we saw a tank with a 
big, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star
 emblem. W-We didn™t kn
ow what that™s -- I 
didn™t know what that™s -- th
is means the American
 army, I know the five star emblem 
was the Russian army, so we thought that™s
 the Russian army cam
e. But it wasn™t so, 
because hours later, one s-single soldier came 
in, a short, little fello w what had a -- a -- a 
-- a rucksack on his back, and 
he said he is an American
. It was a little fellow from 
Brooklyn. And the first thing he said, ﬁWhere 
is there water?ﬂ He was thirsty, so I said, 
ﬁWe have a water fo -- water pump, but you™re
 not allowed to drink it,ﬂ -- be -- matter of 
fact, the first time I went in to the camp, the commander told
 us we are not allowed to 
drink from this water, because this may give 
typhoid. And he said 
if anybody™s drinking 
from this fountain, he going to
 be shot. And he said, ﬁTo pr
ove to you,ﬂ he took out his 
pistol, took an innocent man, and shot 
him. A Russia-Russian worker. This camp 
consisted of building prisoner 
of war camps for the Ameri
can flyers, which was never 
finished, and that™s the reason we slept on sa
nd. So now, let™s go 
right -- back to the 
American soldier. He said he was thirsty. So 
we said to him, ﬁYou cannot drink from this 
fountain, because you™re going to die.ﬂ He 
says, ﬁNo problem.ﬂ Took
 the water, put it in 
his canteen, and put a pill into his water, shook 
it, and he drank it, and I think this was the 
biggest miracle I ever saw in my
 lifetime at that time, th at he survived, he didn™t die from 
his -- because of this little pill. A few hours 
later he says he going to bring some food, 
give it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food b
ecause we were starving. I mean, when I was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064

liberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 
or 94 pounds. So  in th at evenin g, or next 
day, the French came with a kitchen, a truckwhich had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the 

back, and the French men, th
ey -- they said, ﬁThat™s the 
fr -- thanks to the French 
liberation,ﬂ which wasn™t so, ﬁwe going to sing
 ‚The Marseilles.™ﬂ A nd I had a friend of 
mine which name is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Mo
nyek Ravel. And I said, ﬁI will not sing the 
French national anthem, 
because they did not lib
erate us.ﬂ So I said, ﬁRavel, since we are 
free, let™s get out of here.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, I 
don™t want to go.ﬂ I said, ﬁRavel, good-bye, I 
am leaving.ﬂ He followed me. And this how I 
left the camp, but it -- the biggest miracle I 
saw that time was the canteen 
with the pill in the water.  
Q: I should just say that in your first inte
rview, you did talk abou
t that period, and you 
talked about your liberation, so I asked the qu
estion just to find ou
t a little bit more about 
what was going on inside of you at that tim
e, as far as what yo
u -- you said, you know, 
this was a mo ment of realizing that you were free, and -- and wh at -- and wh ether that 

meant -- did you have any sense of allegiance to  any co untry, or an y people, or -- or what 
-- what were your thoughts inside, at that point? 
A: No, thi -- at that point, I felt I was an 
orphaned. This the firs
t time I felt I was an 
orphan, because it was 
bewildering being free. What does 
that mean being free? Do I go 
wherever I want to go? Or do I go where th
ey going to tell me to go? And in -- I -- I 
didn™t have anything, no clothing, I had no fo
od. I left the French camp, and I -- I start 
missing people. I missed my  parents, I mi sse
d my sister.  My sist
er, I thought she was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
 
perished anyway s. She was a very, very skinny , little girl, so I said she cannot survive the 
camp. But I had a brother of mine, which was 
six years younger than I was, I said, ﬁHe 
was a strong lad, maybe he survived.ﬂ But 
unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a 
different card. The only one w
ho survived was my sister , nob
ody else. So when I walked 
out, I wanted to go back to 
Prag ue, to Czechoslovakia. An
d -- and we marched, Monyek 
and I, we marched, and I™m sure I told 
it before, this -- I was -- first time I was 
encountered  with baseball. I spoke about the ba
seball, so it™s -- I don™
t have to spay about 
that any more. 
Q: No, you don™t. Yeah, yo
u did mention th at. And you also mentioned -- when  you 
mentioned Monyek, did you -- yo-you told  ab
out how you took leave of him because he 
had wanted to go to  Paris, and you had -- 

A: Correct. 

Q: -- you didn™t want to stay in the detention camp . 

A: Correct, correct, yes. 
Q: I™m wondering, did you ever 
have contact with Mo nyek again? 
A: No, I found out Monyek went to Sw eden . 
I wrote it to the Jewish HIAS, or it was 
some organization in Sweden, to get in touc
h with Mo nyek Ravel, but it never, never got 
-- never I got an answer, never heard from him 
since. That™s correct, I completely forgot. 
He want to go to Paris, and I want to go 
back  home. And I™m sure
 I told you I finally 
wound up in  a DP camp. The American took me 
to DP camp  in -- I told him I was Polish, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
7
 
 
 
 
 
and I decided it™s going to Po land, it™s closer
 to go to Poland, 
from Poland to -- to 
Teplice, to Czechoslovakia, 
than -- than staying where I 
was. So you know the story 
about the rape of the women in 
the -- in the -- in th
e -- in the garage, and I don™t know if 
you know th is, when  I came home, finally came
 back to Prague, I got sick. I was sick, 
and I was in the hospital, and the clothing, I 
was changed because I was full of lice. Told 
you this story, too. 

Q: No, th e -- not about the clothing. 
A: No? I -- I went back to Prague, and I went 
back to Prague with 
fu -- for I could -- at 
that time you had to  get a permission to -- they
 put you where -- where 
they have to -- for 
housing and food. So, be
fore I went to the office, I sa
w that they was checking your 
clothing. So I was lice, I was very filthy and 
lice, because I still had that regular shirt, 
except I took somebody 
else™s shoes. So I took my -- 
I saw somebody had a bag there 
with clothing, so I took the clothing out of hi
s bag, and put my  clothing next to his bag. 
And so I went for -- and I went there, and si
nce I was a citizen of Czech-Czechoslovakia, 
that time th ey gave me, and I stayed in the Ho
tel Prague -- excuse me, Hotel Paris, except 
I got sick, and I got rheumatic fever. And they
 put me the hospital to -- hospital name of 
Boulav cabbage, I spen t some tim
e there, and I was in the wo  -- in the room with some 
Russian soldiers, and they we
re feeding me vodka. So  the medication did not help too 
much, because whatever medicat
ion th ey gave me, the vodka 
counteracted it. So finally 
the doctor said, ﬁYou know, by
 now you sh ould be having the results.ﬂ So finally he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
 
found out, he saw a glass of vodka there, so
 he put me another room, and -- and finally I 
got better. It was quite bad, I couldn™t even  f
eed my self because I had no mu scles in my  
hands. And after this I went to Teplice. 
Q: How long were you sick in the hospital? 
A: Approximately two to thre
e weeks. Quite some time, wa
s coots -- three weeks. But it 
was terrib -- matter of fact, they fed me ther
e, they -- after we got out of the ward where 
the -- where the Russian
s soldiers were, so I started to
 gain weight, and I got back 
mobility of my hands. 

Q: When  you went back to Teplice, you men
tioned in th e video interview that you had -- 

a little bit about what happened, 
that you had met your former -- 
A: Maid. 

Q: -- maid. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And that people were -- were helpful 
to you, because you were the only su rvivor. 
A: Only  [indecipherable] yes, yes. 

Q: Can you talk in more detail? Did -- di
d -- were people aski
ng you about what had 
happened , and were -- did you
 form friendships, or -- 
A: Nobody asked me what had happened , becaus
e I didn™t want to be
 the oddity of the 
whole town. And I tell you something funny, th
ing is, by evt -- everybody spoke Czech at 
that time, nobody want to speak German, but
 the first opera I saw in  Teplica, was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
 
[indecipherable] Bride, in Ge rman. Nobody spoke German, 
[indecipherable]. I couldn™t 
go back to my father™s
 -- my  parents™s house, because there was an engineer, a German 
engineer, who had th e plans of the coal mines,
 we had the coal mines underneath Teplica, 
and so th ey didn™t want to antagonize him th
at he should not dest
roy the maps, or should 
not destroy the ba -- ma -- the -- the coal mine, 
yeah coal mine. So they gave me a lovely, 
lovely apartment, a big apartm
ent that comp ensated for the house, which I didn™t have at 
that time, and th ey gave me a big store. It 
wa s a business, this was 
electrical business. I 
don™t know if I told you about -- did 
I speak about the electric business? 
Q: A little bit, a little bit. 
A: Yeah, they gave me the electric business,
 which was good, and they gave me liskies, 
s-slips -- food slip fo r the privileged class of 
-- of -- of Czech Republic, a matter of fact, 
this where I met Czech  -- Czechoslovakia, this
 -- matter of fact, I met my father™s old 
maid. Except, ventually, when 
the Russians start taking it over, 
they ask me to join the 
Russian army , which I said, ﬁWhy should I join 
the Russian army?ﬂ Ac
tually they wanted 
join the Russian Air Force. Th
ey said, ﬁBecause, let™s me tr
uthful, you have
 nobody here 
who will miss you.ﬂ And to  prove, they -- that gave
 me four or five weeks to make up my 

mind, and th e first thing wh at they do, they
 took the store away 
from me -- the business 
away from me, and I became the 
helper, because you have to 
be employed, I became the 
helper to the -- the fellow who they  gave
 the busin ess to. Good 
Russians -- a good Czech 
Communist. And it™s be -- they made it quite in
 -- unpleasant for me. So I decided is -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
 
more they took aw
ay my food stamps
, also. So I -- this -- me --
 just prove to them this 
they meant busin ess. So even tually I smuggled  
my self back to -- to Germany, to Hagana -
- the Hagana smuggled me back, and I wound up in Munich. 
Q: Can you -- before all of that
 happened in  Teplice, did you 
have any interest in staying 
there, or were you hoping to leave? 
A: I never wanted to  leave. I loved Tep
lica, I loved Czechoslovakia, I -- I never 

encountered ani -- any i -- da -- anti-Semitism. 
I really loved it, my father who loved it 
there, all -- the whole family loved it. I felt 
a hundred percent a Czech
 citizen, I liked that 
-- by the way, let me g o  back a little bit. At
 same time it happen
ed that Jan Maserik 
allegedly committed suicide, mer -- Jan 
Maserik was the son 
of Thomas Caric 
[indecipherable] of the president. And he co
mmitted suicide in Rach
en. Rachen is in a 
castle. I was in -- in Prague at the same time, 
at that time. The window he -- he -- he was 
a corpulen t man, he was a heavy set man. The window in the bath room was 

approximately six or seven feet high, in -- in
 -- in the bathroom. Even  if you stood on a 
commode -- on the toilet, you couldn™t squeeze 
through the window. No
t only  this, even 
if he could, he couldn™t get through the 
window voluntarily, because the window was too 
narrow for him to jump out the 
window. So when  he landed, 
he f -- they found, on his 
clothing they found -- they see somebody™s 
pushed  him. So, you 
know, it™s what -- the 
clothing was ripped on the si
de where he went through the mindow -- window. And -- 
and th-that™s also added to it, this -- I was scar
ed that™s -- whatever 
they said, they meant 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
 
business, there was not -- no bluffs. It™s a be --  they -- they -- they m
eant that I was scared 
of them. I was scared of the 
Russians, because a -- what I we
nt through with this -- with 
the raping of those women and -- and the be 
-- they behavior, that I -- I was scared of 
them, because I don™t know if I said it, when  I was freed  finally, they drafted me in the 
Russian army for a few days, where I escaped, 
because we -- thanks to a -- a b ag of sugar. 
So -- so I didn™t want 
to deal with them. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I still was by myself, I didn™t have 
anybody. Nobody came 
to me, nobody knows 
me. I came there, I was a newcomer
 of the block, so [inaudible] 
Q: So you didn™t have any stro
ng friendships there, that -- 
A: I di -- never made any. I wasn™t long en
ough to  make any strong 
friendship, plus my  
Czech wa -- wa-was not as good as it should
 have been, because I™ve -- through all those 
years, I always picked  up all those differe
nt languages, so sometime my  Czech was 
mixed in with Polish. So a lo
t of th em were not -- I don™t know, a lot of them, some of 
them didn™t even believe -- believe me
 that™s -- I came from Teplice. 
Q: Another question about Teplice, you had me
ntioned just briefly in the first interview 
that your -- that your father was a refug
ee, but your mo th er had been  from the area. 
A: My mother is from Austri
a. My mother is -- my moth
-mother -- my mother is from 
Salzburg. Her older sister was married to a colo
nel -- a -- a corporal in the -- in Austrian 
army. He was stationed in Teplice. He was st
ationed in  Teplice, so his wife, which now 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
 
she was his wife, came  to stay with Teplice. 
Since -- since my  mo ther was in Salzburg, sh 
-- and she was the youngest one,
 she took her to stay with 
her in Teplice, in this house 
she -- they stayed in Te plice, but they actually come fro
m Austria. My father™s a Swede. 
He came to -- to Teplice only because in 1920, 
he couldn™t make a living in  Prague, so he 
decided to  go to  Teplice. And I don™t know if 
I told you the story, 
he met my aunt -- no, 
he went to  Teplice, and wh en
 you go to Teplice by rail, from 
Prague to Teplice, you have 
to go to a city by the name of Owseek. Owsee
k you change your train, you go to Teplice. 
Sitting in a rail from O w seek on the way to Teplice, he sees
 a lady sitting across in -- in 
the railroad. So he says to the lady, ﬁYou th ink you can -- there is any jobs available in 
Teplice?ﬂ So the lady thinks to
 herself, ﬁThat™s all what we 
need is another refugee.ﬂ So 
she tells, ﬁYoung man, I tell you 
what you should do
, go back  to Prague wh ere you came 
from.ﬂ He said, ﬁTell you truthfully, I don™t 
have any money to go back.ﬂ Long story 
short, two year -- two years later, she was my mother™s sister. And that™s how my father 

wind -- wound up in  Teplice and -- and wh en 
I was born they were quite, quite poor. A 
matter of fact, my mother compensated, or 
my parents co mp ensated. Their livelihood is 
they were stuffing geese with 
-- s -- geese int -- ag
 -- stuffing the gees
e, so they -- the 
liver became big, and they was 
selling the liver to export to
 France, and so they had the 
meat for nothing. Some years la
ter, when my sister was born,
 we were quite well off, we 
already had six people in help. So  
-- so it™s ch anged quite dramatically. 
Q: So your father™s training, 
his profession before he left -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
 
A: My f -- my father comes fro
m a fami ly of bookbinders. Po
 -- anything which bo -- er -
- had to do with book. My fa
ther™s youngest brother was 
doing lettering on th e covers, in 
the gold leaf ri -- my father 
learned bookbinding, leather book binding. My  father™s oldest 
brother learned -- I don™t know what -- it™s
 so mething to do with
 th-th-the paper, 
whatever you do with the pa
per. So all of them were involved in  bookbinding. My 
father™s parents perished in the first Worl
d War, his mo ther and his older sister. They  
perished in -- in Berlin. An
d this where he comes -- cam
e from -- eventually wind up in 
Teplice. 
Q: Did you ever return to Teplice after that? 

A:  I was just there last March. I took my  
ch ildren back to  Teplice, all my  children, I 
treated them a trip, we went to Teplice, we went to Munich, went to Dusseldorf, went to 

Prague, and went to a -- the Theresienstadt
 where approximately 21 members of my f -- 
my parent™s family perished
. So I took them to Tep lice, and I took them to 

Theresienstadt. And coming back to  Tepli
ce wasn™t anything I saw. I saw my  high 
school, I saw my elementary school. I s-saw 
where -- where -- the park where we left, I 
didn™t see the -- by th e way, the house we
 owned was taken down
, and th ey built big 
blocks of -- of apartment houses, Russian st
yle drab, and -- and ugly, and square. So -- a 
matter of fact, th-the market, which was calle
d the Mozartsplatz became the Leninplatz, 
which now has now stopped bei
ng the Leninplatz, so they 
called it th e Marsarekplatz. 
And the statue of Mo zart they put in the other 
par -- in a different park. A matter of fact, I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
 
was looking for the Mozart, finally I found
 him not far, which 
now it became spar -- 
[indecipherable] spar, which ca
lled -- became the Beethovenspar. So I went to Teplice, 
but the funny thing is, I almost went as a 
tourist, no -- very little emo tional about it, 
because this was hundreds and hundreds years ago.  
Q: Did you see anyone you knew from there? 

A: Nobody™s there, I a m the onl
y one. There is -- matter of fact
, I just f -- read recently, 
Jews in Teplice are -- s -- b -- lived there si
nce 1414. During the war -- after the war, I 
was one of the few. Now they had the little bi
t, they coming from S-Slovakia now, it™s -- 
it™s a -- become a Czech Repub
lic, they come in fro
m Slovakia, they liv
e in Teplice, but 
now again, it™s diminishing. The population 
of Teplice are diminishing. The temp le, 
which was a huge, beau tiful temp le is only -- a
nd now they have a -- a stone is set on this 
place, in this platz, on this place stood a synag
ogue, that™s all what it says. At this place 
stood a -- stood a synagogue,
 and that™s was Teplice. 
Q: What about non-Jews? 

A: I don™t know anybody non-Jew, because I 
was young. I was young 
when I left, I mean 
-- and my friend, my best friend, I mean -- I d
on™t know if I told the 
interviewer, my best 
friend was -- name was Horst, and -- by th e way, let me  emphasize, I never, never 

encountered  anti-Semitism in -- 
in ch -- so long I lived  in Czechosl-slovakia that time. 
And we had a big house, and a 
b -- in the backyard  of th e house we had -- I had -- part of 
the garage, I had rabbits. And we
™re playing with -- this fellow Horst, we™re playing in a -

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
 
- and he says to me -- me, ﬁMy father said
 that you are Jewish, are you Jewish?ﬂ And I 
truthfully  didn™t know what he meant, becaus
e religion never came up as a subject in any 
conversation. Anyways, this wa
s the last time I saw this fe
llow. From there I w ent to 
university th -- Budapest, you know, because H
itler showed his ugly 
colors. So I left 
Teplice, and I finally came back 
in Teplice in 1999. By the wa
y came back very sick, I ga 
-- I got pneumonia. 
Q: And it -- and you really didn™t feel much 
emotion being back th er
e, it was -- you were 
-- felt -- 

A: At the ti -- th-the emotion wasn ™t there, 
because whatever I knew, wasn™t there. The 
house which we lived in, wasn™t there. The onl
y -- the emotion was this, I can™t believe it. 
There™s the high school -- there th e la -- no, 
there™s the elementary school in -- up  the 
hill. Was the high school I went to. Spoke to
 a lot of people, none of them knew where -- 
where I -- what [indecipherable] Mozartplatz,
 because it was a huge, gorgeous statue of 
Mozart, and the city all was be-behind it. I 
said, ﬁWas -- where™s th
e Mozartplatz?ﬂ First 
thing, very few of them spoke Czech. It™s 
amazing that™s very few of them speak Czech. 
And most mas -- not all -- most -- all of 
them, nobody -- nobody kn
ew where Mozartplatz 
was, there -- this was there 50 years ago. So went to the city hall, and all of them are 
young people, they said, ﬁWe have no archives
 of it.ﬂ No archives. I came the wrong day 
anyways. So, by coincidence, 
when I went to -- my
 mother was in charge of the theater, 
the opera and the theater, cult -- cultural center. So
 we went -- at least I went to see where 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
16
 
 
 
 
 
my  mo ther stayed the cultural center, and all 
of a sudden I see Mozart statue, oh it™s very 
interesting. We-Went to see that the spot 
where Moz -- where Beethov -- I don™t know if 
I said it, Beethoven, and -- and Gerta walked
. Gerta and Beethoven used to come that 
summer. And Gerta says to Beethoven, ﬁMove 
aside, the Kaiser is
 behind you.ﬂ And he 
said, ger -- ber -- Beethoven said to Gerta, 
he says, ﬁRemember one thing, in hundred 
years, nobody knows who the Ka
iser was.ﬂ And this is -- it™s all w ritten up, all over. And 
-- so I went to this place, and matter of f
act, as a child I rememb
er my father took a 
picture of my  sister and I, befo re my  brot
her was born, right on the same spot where 
Mozart -- which I happen to have the 
picture, my  aunt gave it to me . 
Q: It sounds as if you had a very
 artistic family, 
is that right?  
A: No, I -- I don™t think art -- artist -- artistic 
family doesn™t come thro
ugh genes. It™s just 
if you have it, you have it. If 
you don™t have it, don™t have it. 

Q: Were you always -- always interested in art? 

A: I was always interested in 
art, even as a youngster, I we
nt -- not as young, but when I 
went to Budapest, when  I lived in Budape
st, I went to mu seums. I loved to go to 
mu seums. And so I always loved art, loved a lo
t of -- I loved architecture, I love bridges. 
I love bridges a lot. I found bridges just so
mething -- something wonderful about it. So I 
like that. 

Q: I should mention for anyone
 who would listen to this ta
pe, that your house is filled 
with beau tiful art works, and paintings, some of wh ich you™ve created yourself. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
17
 
 
 
 
 
A: Thank you, thank you. 
Q: And when did you start pain
ting and -- and making art yourself? 
A: As a hobby, as a hobby, started as a hobby,
 because I tried to fill my day. I™m quite 
busy now, so as I said, I™ll get up 6:30 in the 
morning, but always try to squeeze in a few 
hours, if i can do it. I ben -- had -- have it ea
sily, but i -- I started to paint some, but it™s 

just -- I didn™t feel a ba -- if it™s not emotiona
l, I don™t do it. Has to -- has to be emotion -- 
I judge -- as you notice it, I™ve completely di
fferent -- different form of arts, b u t I do it 
emotion -- I buy a picture emotionally, not because it fits a décor, because blue doesn™t fit 

with yellow. So this how I do it. Matter of fa
ct, I -- I did this sculpture, too, wh ich is 
called ﬁThe Tower of Babel.ﬂ 
Q: Does it have any mo re of a story to it that you want to say? 
A: Yes, it has a story. There is -- it™s -- ac
tually, it™s happen under the Babylonian king, 
and they  decided it™s go -- they™re going to  build
 a tower to God. And 
this happened right 
after Noah, and what happened is everybody 
spoke the single language. Everybody sti -- 
stood each other. So they decide
d they™re going to bu
ild a tower all the ways up to God. 
So the angels came to God, he says, ﬁYou
 know somebody is building a tower, it™s high 
up to  You.ﬂ So God said, ﬁNobody does it.ﬂ A
nd He destroyed the to
wer, and everybody 
spoke a different language. And the conseq
uences was, there™s 
nobody understood each 
other. And there™s the reason y
ou have all those crazy colo
rs, nobody understands each 
other. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
 
Q: So this has -- this story -- 
A: It™s a Biblical thing, yes, yes, yeah -- 

Q: -- has a special -- but it has a special, personal meaning? 
A: No, no, no, nothing persona
l meaning, I -- the -- the personal meaning is all those 
languages, and nobody talks the same one. 
We don™t understand each other, we don™t 
understand each other. 
Q: You -- your education was interr
upted when you were a young man. 
A: Yes, was a young man, because I was at
 college in Hungary, and I was deported, 
because I was a Czech citizen at th at time,
 it was a skirmish be
tween Slovakia and 
Hungary, and they arrested me
, and I shall never forget it.
 I came h o me from the movie 
seeing ﬁModern Time,ﬂ with Ch
arlie Chaplin, and they  arrested me, and they  deported 
me. No, s -- I was in jail. Was jail for two or
 three days, and they  w-wanted to  deport me 

to ch -- back to Czechoslovakia. So I didn™t
 want to go back to 
Czechoslovakia, because 
he already occupied Sudatenla
nd in Au stria. So the only la
nguage I thought is similar to 
Czech, so I was deported to Po land. By the way, I want to -- I don™t know if I said it, 

when I lived in Hungary, I play
ed in the movies. I made tw
o or three films with quite 
known actors, which came finally  to America,
 and became quite known actors here in 
America. 

Q: You did mention it, but I wanted to ask if 
you -- were you always really interested in 
movies, or did that just -- wa
s just a matter of chance? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
19
 
 
 
 
 
A: It™s -- it™s came to be just by chance, 
and it suppl -- supplemented my  income, because 
I -- I didn™t have too mu ch money. A matter 
o f fact, the worst thing I could do, I was 

peddling vegetables, and this was -- I don™t 
know why, it was extremely degrad ing fo r 
me, but not only this, I had to study at the sa
me time. Usually you don™t have a time to do 

those things. B- But so the -- 
when I got the job in the summe
rtime, playing in the movie, 
supplemented my income quite 
well. And in Budapest I was quite a -- quite a bright man, 
because we had to do an essay,  in the college we had to do 
an essay about -- I forgot what 
it was. And I and another fellow won the essay.
 And for my college, or
 all the colleges in 
matter of fact, the compensation was this we 
allowed to -- we had 
a interview with the 
prelate of Hungary -- of my -- my so-called 
friend of mine, I went by ra-ra-railroad to a 
city by th e name of Estergum. Did I ever me
ntion this story? I went to the city of 
Estergum, and we have int -- audience with 
the archbishop of Hu ngary, in the city of 
Estergum. So it wasn™t only fo r my  college, 
there was a lot of the college -- enormous, 
big, big hall, gorgeous. And we staying in -- 
and we staying in a -- in a -- in a -- in a 
semi-circle, and the -- the archbishop co mes out 
with a entourag e of four or five people, 
and he go -- starts to face to the left, a
nd he goes around, he go
es around, everybody 
kisses his ring. And I said, ﬁI will not kiss this
 man™s rin g .ﬂ So finally he comes to me -- 
in th -- in -- in Hung-Hunga
ry, you say, ﬁKasi chuclum,ﬂ 
as a salutation. What this 
means, I kiss your hand. So  I said, ﬁKasi c
huclum,ﬂ I shake his hand, no problem. Walks 
around, fine, a -- finishes, goes to the doo
r, this one good looki
ng, tall fellow, turns 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
20
 
 
 
 
 
around, an d to the t -- says something, and t-
to the archbishop, see,
 and he turn  -- the 
archbishop turns around, and the other fellow 
turns around, he looks at me, and does f -- 
points me. I said, ﬁI know, I™m going to  the ex
ecution. They going to
 kill me.ﬂ I mean, 
why should he point to me? The -- the archbi
shop, and two more, three more men walk 
in, the tall, tall fellow. Those -- this -- me -- 
w -wave to me, and I should come to him. I 
said, ﬁDefinitely this is it, firing squad.ﬂ Walk
 into the room, walk to
 his office, huge o -- 
marble, with a wonderful design
 on the floor. Takes me around
 the shoulder, and he says 
to me, ﬁI hear you™re from a different per-per
suasion.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ He says, ﬁWhat are 
you?ﬂ ﬁA-A-A Jew.ﬂ So that™s fine, says, ta
lks to me -- matter of
 fact, everybody got 
sandwiches, or some kind of -- like a box lu nch,
 it was something that I ate with him. I 
ate with him. And during the co nversation, he
 says to me, ﬁWould you like to see where I 
going to  be buried?ﬂ I said, ﬁThat™s very unus
ual to ask somebody [indecipherab le] to be 
buried.ﬂ He says, ﬁSure.ﬂ He takes me down,  he takes me down to  the catacombs. So 

when  you walk down to the basement, or so
-called catacombs, th-there™s a -- a double 
staircase -- one -- both sides, there™s a stairc
ase going down. So  on ea
ch one on the end, 
there™s a statue. So he says to me, ﬁI bet yo
u you don™t know wh at those statues mean.ﬂ I 
didn™t know a Jew is allowed to bet. But it 
was very easy. One statue was a black statue, 
had a f -- a torch facing up, and the other si
de the statues had a f -- torch facing down . I 
said, ﬁThis is life, and this is death.ﬂ So he
 very s -- was very impressed with it. And I 
walked down, he showed
 me the niche wh ere he™s going 
to be buried, and we walked

back up. And was for quite a pleasant thi
ng, and a matter of fact, I was extremely 
flattered, oh, I was so flattered. The fe
llow who I came on the railroad, wasn™t too 
flattered with me. Matter of fact, he never sp
oke to me since. Not ev -- since, now I don™t 
know where he is, but h-he wasn ™t Jewish, 
he never spoke to me, he was so jeal -- 
Q: Why do you think th
at he was jealous? 
A: He was jealous, just jealous. 
Q: And this was the actual archbish op 
who had taken you down, and showed you 
[indecipherable] 

A: Yes, yes, the archbishop of Hungary , yes, 
yes, yes. Or this tall fellow, I was -- oh, he 
looked like a movie acto
r. Yes, this was arch -- the archbi
shop, in the city of Estergum. 
Q: I wanted to ask you a little more abou
t your -- your educa
tion, what you were 
studying, and -- 

A: At college I was studying arch itecture.
 I was studying architect
ure, but we stopped 
with it, so we didn™t do it. So  Hitler took care of this also. 
Q: Did you ever want to go back  a
nd study architecture again, or do that? 
A: I would love to go s -- I wanted to go [i
ndecipherable] but except I have to make a 
living. I came to America with
 six dollars in my  pocket.

Q: -- again that -- 
A: Which one was it? When -- when I came to
 America, I came with six dollars in my 
pocket. Actually, they gave me 10 dollars befo
re I left, except I spent 21 days on the -- on 
the -- on -- at sea. I left in 
a ship by the name of Ernie Pyle, and landed with Merle 
Marlane, because we had to transfer inich --in the English channel,
 from one ship to the 
next, and the waves were tremendous, it wa
s a tremendous storm there, and England 
wouldn™t let us in, the 800 refugees, they wo
uldn™t let us in. Even
 I came as a political 
escapee, but anyways, as it was part of the 
800 s -- passengers. I came -- we landed April 
the first, 1947, in th e harbor of New Yo rk, and 
I decide I gonna s -- la --sta -- start my  life 
all over. I had an old, old overcoat. I took 
th e overcoat and dropped it in the Hudson 
river. So I came with a thing, with a s -- only 
suit, a -- a suitcase of books, and six bucks, 
and this how m -- I started my life. So I had an
 aunt of mine, which I went to stay with 
my aunt for a little while, except th
ey was almost as poor as I wa
s. So, I had to find a job. 
I -- I -- since I sub -- mentioned before, I play
ed in the movies, I got a contact to Eddie 
Cantor. And Eddie Cantor was in 
contract at that time to RKO,
 and they offered me a job, 
a job o -- to be an usher in Radio City Mu si
c Hall, or become a waiter in -- up in the 
Catskills, some hotel in the Catskills. I didn™t 
want to do any of thos
e two. I didn™t want 
to be a server, be an usher showing seats, or 
being a server in a hote
l, so I declined all 
those offers. So I got myself a job -- actually, 
my  cousin got me a job in S. Klein, there 
was a department store, an S. Klein, I got 
a job for 28 dollars a week, 60 hours a day. Six 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
 
days, 10 hours a day. After tax and ev erythi
ng else, I came home with 24 dollars. Out of 
the 24 dollars, I had to give 15 dollars to my
 aunt fo r room and board. Actually, it was 
only room, and a Sunday dinner. 
Everything else had to be my  own, so with the subway , 
which I think at that time was a n ickel or di
me, I didn™t have too mu ch money. So I lived 
on one sandwich a day, and I lived on salami
 sandwiches for months. Simp le reason is, I 
didn™t speak English -- I hardly
 spoke English, and I go into
 the cafeteria, I saw on a 

board, salami. So I said salami in [indeciph
erable] language must be salami. S o  I walk 
down the line and I said to th
e fellow, the server that was serving, ﬁSalami.ﬂ H e says 
something to  me, I didn™t understand it, but he
 had a long knife, and he pointed to a rye 
bread, so I wave my  head, and so he made 
me a salami sandwich, 
and when you got the 
register, there were kind of small containers 
of milk, so I took two containers of milk. 
After one week, or two weeks, he knew already. 
So I went to the -- came to the end of my 
line, my  salami sandwich was waiting on -- for 
me. After this m -- I found -- my sister 

came here, found my sister, so
 I had to save some money 
even to send it to her. So, I 
lived on salami sandwic
hes quite some time. 
Q: Tell me -- it was so -- you did mention in 
 your video interview how you had thro wn  
your coat into the Hudson river, and th at was so  remarkable to me that you had done that, 
and I -- I wanted to hear a little bit 
mo re about wh at ma de you do that. 
A: I-It -- oh, it was -- actually, it was a rebirth.
 I was born again. That™s what I felt. By 
the way, I didn™t see the Statue of Liberty th at 
day, it was foggy. But I felt, I want to start 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
 
with zero. If I could ha -- cou -- dressed comp le
tely naked, I would ha
ve done it, because 
I found out this my  new life. It™s wa -- the pa
st, and I don™t -- I don™t want to dwell of my  
past. Plas is -- pa -- past is only history, so
 maybe it should  teach you some -- but I cannot 
dwell on it. According my fath
er -- my father said, ﬁHate ta
kes a tremendous big effort.ﬂ 
And I don™t have this effort, I just can™t take
 this effort to hate. I -- th at™s the reason -- 
maybe it™s wrong, I don™t hate. I just don™t 
know how to hate. In coming to America, I 
felt this was the only thing that you ca -- I c
ould shed . If I would have clothing in my  
suitcase, I would have thrown  
out too, but I only had book
s, and th ose I wouldn™t part 
with. So, this was a reb irth, this was de
finitely a rebirth, throwing the coat. 
Q: What books did you ha
ve in your suitcase? 
A: Concentration camp histor
y. History of concen trati
on -- some prints from Kaita 
Kolbitz, a lot of prints, and matter of fact, I 
wrote a book. And I was introduced to Walter 
Winchell. Not a very  pleasant man. Matter of 
fact, the first day I met him, it was quite a 
shock anyways. And I wrote a book, an outlin
e of a book which -- with -- with -- with 
diagrams, which I wanted to publish and -- through him, I think thro ugh him, I met Dotty 
Schift, which was owner -- owner of The Post. 
At that time it™s called the Piama Post, and 
I -- she was a very gracious lady, and I show
ed her the outline of th
e book, and she said, 
ﬁYoung man, if I am you, I would not do
 it, because we don™t want to awake bad 
feelings, or bad precedent. Let™
s stop hating.ﬂ Or something in 
this context. So anyways, 
I was a little disappointed, and I took my  
diary, and I threw it away, which I always 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
 
regret to this day. But thanks to her, I -- I didn
™t write it. So I came here, so I had to -- to -
- to -- to make a living, so -- and, by the wa
y, two  years later, I was drafted in United 
States army. And I™ve been -- I™m one of 
them who went to the Korean war.  
Q: You went to the Korean war? 
A: Yes. I was drafted -- I was -- n ever been 
overseas. I was -- became a surgic -- I went 
to Texas, and I became a surgical techni
cian, and they send me to Fort Lewis, 
Washington, and I worked in th e infirmary there. Let me tell you an incident in -- two 
incidents in the state of -- in 
-- in the fort. I-In -- in Texas, in San Antonio, Texas. This 
was the first time the two integrated battalions
, we were sleeping with
 blacks, and whites, 
and ev erything together, except wh en we went 
on a subway, or we 
went on the trolley 
cars, we were not allowed to be togeth er. S-
So, this was the bi -- the President Truman™s 
idea, but anyways, didn™t work out very well.
 After this, I went to Fort Lewis, and I 
worked in the infirmar
y til I was discharged. 
Q: Had you ever seen a black person 
before you came to the United States? 
A: Yes, I saw them twice. There was a 
circus by the name of Hargendorf -- Har-
Hargendas -- something Hargen something. An
d he was part of the circus performance. 
Otherwise, I never saw a cir -- eventually I 
saw a circ -- when I wa
s f -- liberated, I saw 
these black soldiers. I saw them
 in the camp , they were playing baseball, but not -- never 
saw one before.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
 
Q: Did it surprise you that there was this 
prejudice in the United 
States against black 
people, that there should be this segregation? 
A: I don™t know if it was surprise, because 
I went through quite a few years with that 
same prejudice, and -- and I had no -- no -- no 
contact with them at that time. T h e first 

time -- the contact that I had was when I work
ed fo r S. Klein department store, and I -- 
I™d never saw the prejudice. In the city of 
-- the subway of New Yo
rk was not segregated, 
so I didn™t see it til I w a-wind up in San Antoni
o, Texas, where the -- su -- where the fact 
of segregation is true. The fact of segregation. 

Q: Did you experience anu -- any 
of that prejudice personally? 

A: In the army . Sure there ba -- in an army
, but a matter of fact, a incident, I took basic 
training in fort -- in Fort Dix, and there™s 
-- I™m sitting, we havi
ng lunch, all -- wa -- 
something, sitting in the mess hall. And ther
e™s a fellow across from 
me, his name, I shall 
never forg et, his name is Deutsch. And he sa
ys to me, talking -- let me emphasize, we in 
American uniforms. And he says to you
 -- me, ﬁAre you a German?ﬂ And I knew 
something going to happe
n. And I say, ﬁYes.ﬂ He says
, ﬁYou know, Hitler did a good 
job?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhat did he do?ﬂ He said, ﬁH
e killed all the Jews.ﬂ So I had a big, big 
pitcher of hot, hot -- they just poured the hot,
 hot coffee. So I held his collar, and I poured 
it over his head, and he got third degree burn
s. And he dropped in 
agony, so the captain 
comes in, he says to Deutsch, he says, ﬁHer
eby ordering you to press charges against,ﬂ -- 
me. Fine. He walks out, and I bend down to  b 
-- said, ﬁDeutsch, if you press charges, you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
 
going to  die.ﬂ I said, ﬁNot only this, as long 
as I™m in this army , you going to  be with 
me.ﬂ He says, ﬁI going to get out of the ar
my before you.ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁNever going to 
happen.ﬂ Su re enough, Deutsch, every mo rn ing 
after you -- with the ba
nd -- they 
took off 
[indecipherable] with the red -- red face. Every 
mo rning, before he got
 out -- after he got 
out of bed to urin ate -- before he got out of 
bed, he urin ate in the bed, and walk ed out. 
And after a month, they  discharg ed him. Deutsc
h got out. This what I experience in -- in 
the army. 
Q: I want to talk more about your early ye
ars in the U.S., but maybe before we do th at, 
we should go back, b
ecause I had a question about your tim
e in -- in Munich, and before 
you came to the united -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- United States. You talked a little bit 
in your videointe
rview about it. You 
mentioned that you were worki
ng for the counter-intelligence. 
A: CIC, CIC.  
Q: And also that you were work ing -- we
re you wo rk ing for the Joint Distribution 
Committee? 
A: I was -- only as a job. This was only as 
a job. I worked for 
CIC. During the war, I 
worked in it -- for the CIC, 
thro ugh -- thro ugh my  professor, I had the professor by the 
name of Zahn. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
28
 
 
 
 
 
Q: How do you spell that? 
A: Z-a-h-n. [indecipherable] th
ink about this, this man was 
always -- was -- fascinated 
me. He had one eyeb row, went from one side of
 the head to the other side. It™s str -- one, 
single eyebrow, wh ich was very, very dynamic 
man. He was not my  idol, I had a idol of 
professor of philoso phy. 
But anyways, through him I -- I we
nt to the -- became -- went to 
the underground, til finally, I we -- we -- went
 to CIC, and I worked
 in the CIC, and I 
worked in a -- I worked
 in a place called the inflowsun
kunstad. Inflowsunkunstad means 
they were delousing uniform which came back, and not only this, they were fixing 

unifo rm. So my  job was -- I had liaison only
 one woman, her name was Renées, I don™t 
know wh at the other name is. 
She was a French lady. I don™t know if she was Jewish or 
not. She with one daughter in -- in Paris,
 and a husband who was killed, he work -- 
w o rk ed  fo r th e u n d e rg ro
und. So we -- so when we saw a uni
form come with a patch, let™s 
say, from the third panzer division. So  I 
told her, you know, we
 got 19 uniform which 
came from the city of Pulsk. So sh e g -- I don™
t know what she did w
ith it, but this how 
we did that thing -- we did -- she found out 
wh ere every division, or what division came 
from what -- where -- plus we had a lot of 
cape -- lot of concen tration camp  women 
sewing strof boots, for the Russian army to put over the shoes, because the winters were 
very severe. And that™s when I worked for the CIC, and til -- til finally -- til August the 
third -- August the second, I went back to th e concentration camp  wh ere my  parents was, 

because I found out thro
ugh a -- through the grapevine that
 -- I don™t think it was through 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
 
prof -- professor Zahn, that my  father was dyi
ng. So I went to see him, and I brought -- 
matter of fact, that™s m-my -- 
the only thing my  sister reme
mbers, I brought -- bought -- 
break glucose sugar, something, because this --
 he needed glucose for whatever he had. 
Anyway s, unfortunately, the next day they  
rounded us up, and I was one of them, and 
they send us to Auschwitz. So 
this was my job with
 the CIC -- with the CIC drop, there -- 
but I lived in the city of Tr
anstahova as a German. My Germ
an was better than any of the 
Germans lived there, even the 
-- the bullov, the head of the 
thing, my German was better, 
so except -- wherever I was, 
my German was not the right 
dialect where I came from, 
because what I speak is hol
kdeutsch, which cames from 
one section only, which is 
Hanover. But, I survived it, and the lady, le
t me tell you something about this lady. 
Gorg eous lady, matter of fact, I show you a picture of her, I have a picture of her. 
Q: Oh, you™re talking about Rainia? 

A: Rainia, yes. But any bigshot who wanted
 to sleep with her, 
she slept with. The 
consequence was unpleasant for the man, who was [indecipherable] killed, but she -- she 
slept with anybody -- any big s
hot who would want to sleep w
ith her.   She was really 
with the high echelon. And with CIC, let me
 tell you, it™s not as exotic as it sounds. I 
don™t know anything. What they
 tell me to do, I did. I 
-- my specialty was railroad 
sabotaging. She was m -- only co ntact I had, 
and I don™t know anyb
ody who she had. I -- 
that™s the reason that it was -- only I know he
r by the first name is, b ecause in case the 
[indecipherable] me, R ainia is
 -- s -- anybody could be Rain
ia. So there always was a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064

sure. I lived in a -- in a Polish home, which 
was -- he was a watchmaker. They gave me a 
room there, which I went home. And th is 
where I lived, and they
 knew I was a German, 
so they were scared of me
, and I was scared of them. 
Q: So you -- they had no 
idea that you were Jewish? 
A: No. No, no. The only difficu
lty I had was -- was urination. We ate there with the 
Germans, th-the -- the Jews, I didn™t know w
ho it was. I wore -- I was what™s called an 
ausdeutscher, a -- a German w
ho came from the -- in Russia, 
they used to have a big 
German colony, so I came one of the [indeciph
erable] office -- one of
 the ausdeutschers. 
And Zahn gave me the papers. Before I went 
to the city, he told me I -- I took a lesson -- 
a course, what movie played three weeks ag
o, what -- what gossip happened fo ur weeks 
ago. So -- so when I came in there, I knew 
whatever was going on. But, while the -- while 
the ch -- head of the -- was the head of the 
f -- bullov, he happened
 to like me, and so  I 
used to eat lunch with him. I don™t know if I 
told you an incident. 
I was sitting with him, 
having lunch one day, and during the conversati
on, he says to -- I -- he -- whatever he 
said, he says da -- I said, ﬁDa ista huntbi
gram,ﬂ which means, actually tr-translation 
means, here where the dog is buried. But this
 doesn™t mean a thing.
 Actually this means 
you hit it right on th e head. That
™s all what it means. Da ista huntbigram. So he said, 
ﬁIsn™t that funny? The first 
time I heard -- the only time I heard it before was from a 
Jew.ﬂ  
Q: How did you respond to that? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
 
A: Scary. Scary, scary, but this was ex
treme a -- a matter of fact, I tell the -- 
Q: Did you just laugh, or something? 
A: No, no, no, nothing, because he
 just said it doesn™t mean da -- Jews, he said it. Matter 
of fact, I went back, and I told it to Rainia
, I said, ﬁYou know [indecipherable] you stay 
there til we let you know.ﬂ They  never let me
 know, but finally she -- she™s the one who 
told me that we know that your father™s dying. 

Q: I wondered if you became 
involved in working with 
the -- the underground, the 
counter-intelligence during the war, because yo
u were seeking it out, or did they come 
cru -- you become somebody new -- 

A: I did not seek it out, I was too young to 
seek it out, and -- and -- and I w -- I did not 
seek it out, they say -- s -- s 
-- I -- they looked for me, 
because I™m bilingual. I spoke 
German, I spoke Czech, I speak 
Polish, I speak Hungarian, I 
sp -- so -- so -- so I™ve -- 
wherever they wanted me, I fit 
in quite well. And I spoke Polis
h better than a -- a native. I 
spoke Polish, and the one thing 
they didn™t let me get in t
ouch with -- with -- with the 
underground, with the -- the 
partisans, because they woul
d not trust them, because the 
partisans at that time, had th
e double -- dual -- dual loyalty. On
e is to the Russian party, 
to the Russian facture, and one is -- was to th
e English facture. So 
they™d never touch me. 
They never trusted them, so they -- I tried to st
ay away from them as 
much as I can. Plus, 
we found out if -- if a Jew join
ed them, they killed 
him. They killed him. So that™s what it 
was. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
 
Q: How did you come to know all of those languages? 
A: Too necessary. I mean, I™m a 
-- I™m a Czech, I went to college to Hungary, my parents 
spoke German. So later I went to Poland, and 
I -- I -- th ey give me four months, I speak a 
language well. Three months, I can -- can co
nverse any language. In  three months I can 

speak it, in four months I™m perfect. 

Q: It™s just a -- a gift. 

A: It™s not a gift. You notice that after 50 ye
ars my  ger -- my  English didn™t improve. My 
-- maybe my vocabulary, but not my accent. 

Q: It sounds good to me. 

A: [inaudible] 
Q: Your -- we don™t know anything ab out you
r religious -- whether you had a religious 
education as a child, or your back ground in that way? 
A: No. I ca -- I -- I -- I -- I did not come 
from a religious background. I know I was 

Jewish. I had a grandparents --  my mother™s 
parents finally -- matter of fact, my father 
did well, he brought over my  grandmothe
r and my  gran dfather, and step -- two 
stepbrothers, and a stepsister. No, no, not true
. He brought over my  grandparents, the two 
boys, and three girls. The two boys work ed 
for my father, and I don™t know what the 
three girls did. All of th em were spinsters,
 none of them got married. I tell you a story 
about one of them. One of th em finally got married, the y
ounger one, and she married a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
 
fellow in Prague who became -- worked for insurance company. My father, by the way, 
w o rk ed  fo r th e u nd e rg ro und . D i d  I ev er say  th is?  

Q: Yes. 
A: He wo rked for tuppa in -- in Prague [i
ndecipherable] Polacks, well, you know th e 
story, yes. So a b -- I da -- Judaism was -- I 
mean, we observed profacto Judaism to s -- to 
appease my  grandparents. So it was only the fact
 that my father went
 to the high holidays, 
and I had to  stay next to him, which was bo
ring. But I had no -- no Jewish background, 
and with me, I became an agno
stic, a quite comfortable one. And Judaism with me is a 
religion, but it™s a philosophy, and I think it™
s a very ethical philosophy. And I™m saying 
that [indecipherable] I was -- 
feel Jewish only by -- becaus
e I was born into  it, and I 
found -- I studied philosophy, 
and I found that it™s extremel
y ethical. And mo st of the 
cultures are based on Juda-C hristian ethics. 

Q: You mentioned in your last interview th
at you had an interest in the Lubovitcher 
movement. 
A: Yes, yes. I -- I -- I -- I -- I was -- I -- I 
took a psychology course
, by the way, here, and 
I studied under Anna Freud, the daughter 
An na Freud, very unhappy young lady. And 
they -- she told me to -- a part
 of the thing to tell me to st
art -- she in terview -- to try to 
help some ladies, and they were the Lubovitc
her ladies. So I tried to help her, we had 
some course, with Lubovitcher ladies, but ab
used ladies. So one lady came back black 
and blue, I said, ﬁHow often 
are you going to tell me you walked  through a glass door? I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
34
 
 
 
 
 
mean, underneath your armp it, you don™t walk thro ugh a glass door. And under your 
chin, you don™t walk glass doo
r.ﬂ So anyways, I went to
 the Lubovitcher, I met the 
Lubovitcher rabbi there, which was very un
successful, because eventually he let me 
understand it was -- you know, they ™re work in
g very  hard, and they  have a lot of 

pressure, and th ey -- whatever they have to 
do. I -- maybe they did -- I don™t -- he didn™t 
say they deserve it, but it™s -- 
may b e they -- they -- they falle
d, or something like this. So 
it was weer unpleasant, very unpleasant. So
 I didn™t do too much with them. I found 
Anna Freud a very unpleasant la -- not unple
asant, unhappy lady. Lived with  a woman 

with the -- with a lady by th e name of Birm
ingham, who was a heiress of Tiffany. Sh e 

had a husband and tw o children, she left th
em, and they  had -- she was a homose -- both 
of them were lesbians. So they lived togethe
r. After she left here, she went to England, 
and started a ki -- like a girl
™s school, a kindergarten. 
Q: Did you have -- so it was more your -- yo
ur interest, and your 
involvement with the 
Lubovitcher movement wasn™t so mu ch as
 you were interested in Hassidism -- 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no Hassidism, only beca
use of those ladies. Th-Th-
Those ladies. Those ladies. I finally -- matter of 
fact, we have here, I just found out by the 
Lubovotch -- Lubovitch temple, 
or something, and they tell 
me this Donald O™Connor, 
the movie actor who plays ﬁAll in the Family,ﬂ
 whose son died because of the overdose, 
something? He gave the money to build  this
 temple. Because, s
eems like when he was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
35
 
 
 
 
 
down, her -- they -- has -- his son, they -- th
at™s the only movement which took him in. I 
don™t know if that™s true or not, but th
at™s what they to
ld  me. E x cu se me.  
Q: So, at this point, you don™t have 
a -- a strong sense of -- of faith, or -- 
A: Religion? 
Q: -- religion of some sort? 

A: No. I have no -- no faith of religion  no
t -- never had one, answer truthfully . And the 
only thing is -- is I™m an agnostic
, which I™d be -- be -- being in
 -- not being an  atheist, is 
but a sim -- simple statement in the Bible. Th
e first statement in th
e Bible, which is in 
Hebrew called Baraiship, means the beginnin
g. I have a question with the beginning, 

because void creates void. There™s nothing in 
void, can nothing be 
created but void. And 
since something happened, there 
has to be a creation, a process of creation. If nobody can 
dispute it, that™s -- excuse me, whatever did 
it, so I find the creation was something there. 
For whoever it was, th ere is a creation. I don™t 
dispute this creation. Matter of fact, I -- I 

just went yesterday, I took a course in the 
Bible, which I took every Thursday , but it™s no 
-- no -- I™m not only  studying the Jewish Bi
ble, I™m studying -- I™m studying the Koran 
also. Funny thing is, I was talking to a phys
icist, he™s a q u ite pronon -- and renowned 

physicist. I said, ﬁIf you believe
 in the Big Bang th eory , and th
e universe in expanding in 
extremely rapid space, is this still the conseque
nce of -- of Big Bang theory, or this is 
only in our solar system, and ev
erything else is expanding of
 his own?ﬂ He doesn™t know 
it either. So, I™m not the only one.

Q: Okay. Going back to Munich -- we got 
a little bit out of that time frame, but you 
mentioned briefly that you were livin
g with a German woman at the time. 
A: I was not -- let me -- I lived with a Germ
an family, Tossan. B-Before the war, bay -- 
before the war, May the fifth -- the war ende
d May the fifth in Germany. In April, 
Hossan, and two mo re boys, I think tw o boys
 and a girl, made a push, or made a -- a 
statement in the u -- in -- in the high school.
 The boy was arrested, and the other ones, 
too, and they  were executed on meat hooks 
in the butcher shop,. Th
at™s the lady I stayed 
with. 
Q: Do you reme mb er her name? 

A: No. If I said at that time,
 may be it, but I don™t rememb
er that now. And that™s why I 
stayed in the city of Borsty
. It is o u tside of Munich.  
Q: Do you want to say some
 more about your work w
ith the CIC after the war? 
A: CIC, yes, after the war, I finally w-wind up
 in -- in Munich agai
n, and I lived with a 
lady in Borsty, and I got a job to
 -- to Jewish -- Jewish --  some Jewi sh organization. And 
I™m working that Jewish organization, and 
Rainia, the woman which I left in Poland 
someplace, which I never knew if she is there.
 I don™t know how she 
found me, it™s still a 
m-my stery to me. And she says, ﬁWe need y
ou.ﬂ I says, ﬁYou don™t need me, because 
I™m finished with it.ﬂ She says, ﬁNo, now we 
have to look fo r Nazis.ﬂ I didn™t want to do 
it, but anyways, I -- I -- I felt I sh ou -- I ow
e her something, because
 I survived it. My 
sister -- I didn™t know about my
 sister, I was the only one 
who was left. So, I start to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
37
 
 
 
 
 
work ing for the CIC again. Actu ally it was 
under the MI five. This is the military 
intelligence five, but later I found out that™s wa
s -- be -- to transferred to MI six, but still 
to me it was the CIC. 
Q: Is this a part of the British army? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. I worked for the British. An
d I was starting to look 
for Nazis. So I look 
for Nazis, and it was ba -- I went. That™s 
the reason I wound up back in Po land, I -- 
because I looked for so me Nazis there, wound up in Ge
rmany all over, and this how I 
found up in -- in the city of
 Lódz, where they transferred 
me there, A u gust the -- 1944, 
and this where I found my food stamps for my
 mother, my sister, an d myself. Anyways, I 
was unsuccessful of finding th e Nazis they wa
nted to -- me to find. I was looking fo r a 
particular Nazi. Seems like he was a important
 person the Nazi apparatus in -- in the 
British zone. So they send me to a city of 
Oofa, and the na -- allegedly the woman knew 

where he was. So I went to see the lady,
 and she says she wants 10,000 dollars. Not 
pounds, she wanted 10,000 dollars
. I go right to my  colonel, he says, you know sh e wants 
-- he said, ﬁGive it to her.ﬂ I said, ﬁHa ha, 
what are you talk about?ﬂ He says, ﬁNext time 
you go, you going to 
bring her the money.ﬂ Not knowi
ng -- this what I -- I™m not -- I 
don™t say it™s a fact, maybe it™s not, they had 
false, counterfeit dollars, and that™s what he 
wanted to give me. Anyways, I w -- I didn™
t know it at that tim
e. I™m going with the 
10,000 dollar, and I went to the lady, says, ﬁOka
y, wh ere is he?ﬂ She says, ﬁI™m not going 
to tell you.ﬂ Said, ﬁWhat do you 
mean you don™t got to tell me ? I came all the way from 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
38
 
 
 
 
 
[indecipherable] came a
ll the way to Oofa, and you say y
ou don™t want to tell me?ﬂ She 
says, ﬁYou people going to leave shortly, and I 
going to have to stay with them.ﬂ And she 
didn™t tell me. I traveled all 
over. I looked for other ones t
oo, but he was the main Nazi. 
Never found him. Finally I™m coming to Americ
a, two re -- two years later. The sergeant, 
who was a sergeant in the CIC, and a British 
boy, his parents, during the -- before the 
war, durin g the war, they moved to California. So
 he came to -- to see his parents, so he 
stopped over there, so -- so -- by them alrea
dy a bigshot. I lived in New Yo rk, I went to a 
nightclub with him, took him out,
 everything is fine. The last 
day I see him, I said to him, 
ﬁBy the way, what happened to
 this fellow?ﬂ He said, ﬁWe go
t him,ﬂ he said, ﬁisn™t that 
wonderful?ﬂ ﬁWhere was he?ﬂ Said, ﬁHe wa
s your co ok.ﬂ He was a cook in a CIC 
headquarters. We never knew it. How we fo
und him was his girlfriend reported  him. 
Otherwise, we wouldn™t ever find him, so you see -- 

Q: He was right under your noses. 

A: He was right there, and 
we never knew he was the cook
 in a CIC headquarters. So, 
after a  ba -- well, I [in d eci
pherable] funny thing let -- sorry
. When I lived in Munich, I 
didn™t -- na -- before I worked for the CIC actually, I used to ch
ange butter for -- for 
opera tickets. So I -- yeah, I remember I gave 
a big slab of butter to get a opera ticket, 
that™s the only way I saw th
e operas in -- in Munich. 
Q: You also mentioned, just briefly, that y
ou had -- you were suppos
ed to go to Poland, 
to see whether the AK, 
the Armia Kryova -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
39
 
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, Armia Kryova, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- was -- whether they were -- were -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, y
eah, that™s the reason I went to Po
land, I -- I didn™t remember why 
I went to Poland. He tells me this day is 
-- the Jews who came back to the city, ma -- 
especially the city of Nemuvera
dim, they were killed. The le
gend is supposed to be an 
organization which kills the Jews
. He never heard of it, I never heard of it, see w h at™s -- 
what happen. I couldn™t think why I went back  to
 -- to -- to -- to Lódz, I went back to -- to 
-- to Prague, to -- to -- to -- to Poland. 
And I found out, sure enough, there™s a 
organization called Arma Kryova, the army  of 
the land. So what happened, if a Jew came 
back to his little town, 
or wherever town he came, and 
he wanted his property back, so 
some Polack took it over. A-After the Germans 
left, the Polack took it over, and now the 
Polack has it, so they want 
the army, so instead of giving 
it to them, they killed them. 
They killed those thing. Matter of fact, I sent
 some pictures to the holo -- gave some 
pictures to the Holocaust Museum with thos
e people who perished, after the war, finally 
coming back after the concentration camp, a
nd they killed them. This why I went to 
Poland, I couldn™t think why I was in Poland, the Arma Kryova. 
Q: Did you have any direct deali
ng with an yone from the Armia Kryova? 
A: No, I didn™t have any but -- dealing thas 
he was an Army Kryova, because nobody™s 
admit that he killed somebody. But I dealin
g with Polish people that took I™m a -- I™m a 
Polack, too. So they ™ll -- dealt with him. A matter of fact, I™ll tell you a little in cident 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
 
what happened to me. I™m in th
e city of Cherzohova, I walk 
-- I have the open shirt, what 
I had a big, ebony cross, I used to wear a 
big, ebony cross. I™m walking up the hill, and 
there™s another fellow, a drunken, walks down the hill, and he points at me, an d he says, 
ﬁPar shiva zhija,ﬂ smelly Jew. I said, ﬁOh my God, I must 
smell even with the cross on 
my chest.ﬂ This was my
 encounter with par shiva zhija. 
And th at™s the reason I wound up 
-- I couldn™t think why I was in Poland, th
at™s the reason. Looking for Arma Kryova. 
Q: Did you look -- did you 
have -- did you look Jewish? 
A: No, I didn™t look -- never looked Jewish. 
Q: Because it seems that you were able to -- 

A: I look Aryan, I look Aryan. 
Q: You were able to get -- 
A:  It™s a -- matter of fact, when I went in
 -- when I work in [ind
ecipherable] think the 
Germans were mo re scared of me than I wa
s of them, because I spoke a better German 
than those -- those volkdeutscher who came 
to him. No, no, neve
r -- never had problem 
looking Jewish. Matter of fact, there was one in
cident. I don™t like to talk about this one 
with somebody. I stood next to a Nazi, and 
he showed  me what he did with  a child. I 
don™t want to talk about it. 
Q: You don™t have to talk ab
out it. You did mention it, first interview. Let™s see. I™m 
going to  flip the tape.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an
 interview with  Beno He
lmer. Do you remember 
what you were doing -- y-you mentioned you 
were work ing fo r a Jewish organization, 
maybe JDC. Do you remember what you 
were doing with that organization? 
A: O-On ly registering people, no
thing more. N-No capacity at 
all, just registeringpeople, 
m-manual -- you know, bookkeeping -- not 
even bookkeeping, just r-registering the 
names. And f -- f -- an d one more thing, I went to look for my sister, 
wherever I went to l 
-- I went to -- months later, I went to look -- wh
erever I went, I went to
 look for my sister. 
And I don™t know if I mentione
d how I met my  sister, or that I --  if I met somebody at 
the crossing of -- a street crossing, where 
somebody was coming out of Landsberg. So  
you know th at story, how I met my sister. 
Q: But I wasn™t sure how -- di
d -- did that pe
rson know you? 
A: No, no, no, no. No, no, no. 
No, no, no. We stop at the li
ght. I stop -- I was on the flat 
truck. We stop at the light, and we just have 
to cross light. The traffic goes one direction, 
traffic goes all directio n, because the t -- the little traffic light became green. During the 
crossing, somebody says, ﬁHow is Sonya?ﬂ So
nya is a very popular name. I don™t know 
who said it, I never saw it, it™s just a mob of
 people going one way, mob of people going 
the other way. And I say, ﬁShe is dead.ﬂ An d 
the boy said, ﬁI just saw her.ﬂ Doesn™t mean 
it was towards me, maybe he d-does know me
, maybe is -- he meant his cousin Sonya, 
whatever it is. And on th is assump tion, I kept
 on looking for my sister again. I never 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
 
thought that she going 
to be -- survive, I always look 
for my  brother. My parents, I don™t 
know,  maybe yes, maybe not. My  father wa
s very, very sick. So, the only one I was 
looking for my  brother, because he was a -- 
hunky -- a ch-chunky guy. No, so this what 
was. 
Q: Yeah, and you to ld about 
how you -- how you f
ound your sister, but
 did you ever find 
out anything certain about your
 brother and your parents? 
A: I am -- I was, not any mo re -- I was involve
d in th e national Red Cross. Matter of fact, 
they just called me maybe two months ago, 
in Switzerland, but they
 -- the -- the -- the -- 
the Red Cross in Boca, here, the Red Cross in 
-- they got in touch w
ith Polish Red Cross, 
there™s no traces. I put traces on -- on the co
mputer, all the Irving Helmer in United 
States. By coincident, there™s six of them
, but none of them are my  brother, yeah. 
Q: So you never found out for certain? 

A: Never, no, no. He™s an old man now, th
e same as I am. I never found him. Never 
found about Ronyek  -- Monyek Ravel, and all yo
u ha -- funny thing is, some years ago, I 
was thinking I would like to m
eet Rainia again, I don™t even
 know where she is. She was, 
I think eight years older than I was.  

Q: At that time, did you have any -- did you 
have any in terest in -- you mentioned just a 
little bit that you were thinking, well, wh
ile you were in Teplice, and you had the 
problem with -- with possibly being drafte
d into the Russian army, that you were 
considerin g Israel, but you ha
d an aunt in th e United Stat
es. Did you have any sense, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
 
while you™re there in Munich, 
of where you really wanted 
to be, wh ere you wanted to 
settle? 
A: I want -- I wanted to go to Israel. And I 
had an uncle, my father™s
 oldest brother, who -
- I got -- h-he got in touch with me, or I -- 
I d on™t remember. No, I got in touch through -- 
through the organization, I was wo rking fo r them
. And he wrote me a letter, he says, if I 
should try, by all means, come 
to America, because your aunt
, Marcia Kramer lives there, 
try to get in touch with her. 
And he gave me the address of
 her. An d because poverty, we 
have poverty in -- in Israel, 
it™s 1947, or 1946, right after the war, it™s right before the 
independence. That™s the reas
on I didn™t go to Israel. 

Q: Did you have strong Zionist 
feelings at that point, or -- 
A: No, no. I did not have -- my  father had stro
ng Zionist feeling. I wa
 -- I was -- you have 
to realize I -- I was sch ool, and -- and -- and 
-- and -- and -- and -- and self survi-survival 
for all those years. So -- so, emotionally, I wa
s surviving -- s-survivin
g. I™m extremely for 
Israel now, but at that time, I just want to
 go somewheres getting out of Europe, which I -
- I -- if not the circumstance, I would stay in 
Teplice, because I love Teplice. But at that 
time, the Russians took ov
er it,  they dealt me 
an ugly, ugly hand.  
Q: Why did you feel more strongly about 
Israel than the Unite
d States, for example? 
A: I didn™t know anything about the Unite
d States. And -- and -- and -- and be-being 

through -- going to  all that last few years, w
ith all the hate against Jews, and everything 
else, I thought something -- Israel
™s going to be the place, at 
least I d on™t gotta feel this

hate. So I don™t -- so -- so that™s what it wa
s. But I would like -- I want to go out of 
Europe, and finally thro ugh -- my  uncle gave 
me the address, I was sponsored to go to 
America. I needed only
 a sponsor because I was a political 
escapee, I wasn™t as a refugee. 
So that™s the reason I came here. 
Q: How did it feel to be in 
Germany, and -- and presumably 
dealing with Germans, after 
what you had 
been through? 
A: As I said before, I don™t hate. No problem. 
Q: You got along well with the wo
man who you were staying with? 
A: Oh, she was -- listen, she -- she hated Nazi
s more than I do. She lost her son on -- on 
the meathook. And she just lost him maybe for 
-- the week before th e end of th e war -- a 
month before end of the war. I mean, she is 
a bitter, old lady. I mean, I -- I -- I b eca -- you 
know, I became that [i
ndecipherable], I became an orph
aned. But it was bewildering. I 
never cried for my mother, I never cried for 
my parents. First time I think I cried was 
when I was free. I mean, because I knew -- I knew, definitely I knew that my fate going 

to be exactly the same as theirs. S o  it was 
only timing. If I don™t do it today, going to  be 
the day after tomo rrow. I had never -- and when
 I was in the concen tration camp, I never 
fought fate. Fate became my big thing. If they te
ll me stay, I stay, sit,
 sit. Whatever they 
do, because I said, I never knew
 what I gonna do. If I go left
, and that™s supposed to go 
right, I said, you know, should have, could have
, would have. It is one thing I never say, 
is should have, could have, wo
uld have. It doesn™t exist. 
So, how do I know wh at I™m 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
 
doing right, if I -- seems like what I did was 
right. But one time, I -- I tested fate. I 
supposed to b -- go to
 a coal mine, and [indecipherable]
 me to go to a coal min e, so I 
roped it off, because I said, coal mine is -- 
is definitel that. So I tried [indecipherable] 
became a cook to one of 
the Nazis in Auschwitz. An
d that™s how I survived. 
Q: Did you talk with the 
-- the German woman that yo
u stayed with about your 
experiences, or did she ask 
you about what had happene
d to you during th e war? 
A: No, I did not. Simple reason is, because I 
w o rk ed  fo r th e C I C .  So
 I did not talk about 
it. She thought I was a -- joined 
the ausdeutscher as a German. 
Q: So you were still w o
rking for the CIC as -- 
A: [indecipherable] after I get th
at apartment over there, yes. It
™s in back of -- yes, yes.  
Q: Was that difficult, to not be -- after what 
you had been through, 
and having to take on 
an -- an identity. 
A: It™s becoming acting. It became acting, 
I mea -- you became an actor. You acted, and 
you became a big shot, because 
I™m looking fo r those bastards
. You know, it™s -- it™s a bi 
-- became a more -- little bit 
more important than anything
 else, and I was looking fo r 
them. So that™s what it was, 
so -- so she didn™t know it. Banya knew I was Jewish, and th-

th-the HIAS -- it wasn™t HIAS, it was J -- J-Jewi
sh something. I worked
 for them. So they 
knew it, and finally the -- Rainia
 gave me the apartment with this lady, and she moved -- 
two houses further down, she liv
ed. She ga -- she got it to me, yes. I mean, the story is I 
came to Teplice -- to Munich smuggling myse
lf out through -- from 
t -- from Teplice, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
 
through -- through marinepart, and Hagana
h smuggled  me over, and at the border, he 
says, ﬁAnybody who has the papers, has to s-
surrender his papers, all the papers.ﬂ So I 
was smart enough not to give him my  pape
rs, otherwise I wouldn™t even come to 
America, because I would have 
no history where I come from. And that™s one -- all of a 
sudden, I™m be -- coming to -- I™m going to
 the country which hated me, which killed 
everybody of my family. And here I am, liv
ing in b -- among them again. That was 
rough. 
Q: And then  -- then you had gotten in touch 
with your aunt? Is that how -- how you made 
the decision to come to the United States? 
A: That™s was only one -- no -- it was only th e decish -- decision to come -- the decision 
was made for me, cause that™s was the only pa
pers I got. So I got the papers. By then, I 
found my sister. When I found my sister, she had papers to go to Canada, as a domestic. 
So I found her just by coincidence, a domestic,
 this was -- so by then, I want to be near 
her. So definitely Israel was out, Palestine wa
s out at that time. America became the more 
logical thing, and not only th
is, I know my uncle lived in 
New York, so she got herself a 
job in Hamilton, wh ich is right on the Cana
dian border, as a domestic, working for the 
docto r. Very attractive young lady. First night, he
 did sexual advances to her. So she quit, 
went back to the camp there, and after that 
she got a job as a domestic for a Dr. Cohen, 
which now they adopted as a 
child, and matter of fact, tw o boys, which are also fi --

physicians. They  like sisters and brothers. A
nd that™s the reason I 
stayed in New York , 
and she should be -- now 
she lives in Toronto. 
Q: You mentioned just a little 
bit about your journey to the 
United States, and the -- and 
the trouble that you went th
rough. Do you want to talk
 more about that journey? 
A: Yes. I left Hamburg, and 21 days later -- 
I left on a ship by the 
name of Merle Marlane 
-- no, no, I left on a ship of Ernie Pyle, and 
came on a ship of Merle Marlane. We broke 
down in English Channel, we lost some mo
tor, something like this. They fixed it -- but 
they couldn™t fix it, so we had to be transfe
rred, as I said, from Ernie Pyle, to the Merle 
Marlane. It was -- the waves were unbelieva
ble high, we had to 
do it on those rope 
ladders. Before we were transferred, they lo
cked us -- they -- they
 lo cked  the women on 
top, and the men down in the hole. The only th
ing they  had, because after all those days 
we ran out of food. So the only 
th -- that they fed us, was Co
ca-Cola, in bottles. At that 
time, Coca-Cola came in
 bottles. So we were drinking 
Coca-Cola. So when the whole -- 
when the ship was going from 
one side to the other, the b -- Coca b-bottles, the glass 
broke, so we were stepping on glass, so we
 couldn™t -- we were scared to walk, so we 
were sitting, and -- and -- and we stayed ther
e for quite a few days, til finally we were 
transferred on -- to the Merle Marlane. The -- 
the -- usually, a trip takes six days, we did 
it in 21 days. So the crossing wa
s not very pleasant one. Came 
here, was a foggy day, as I 
said, I throw my coat into 
the river -- Hudson river. And I 
met my  uncle, the fellow who 
sponsored me. But I couldn™t stay
 with him, I stayed with 
my -- my aunt, on a fi-five

floor walk -up, in th e Bronx. Think she was as
 poor as I was. Seems like she subsidized 
her living -- or income, my mother gave her so
me arts before she came to America, she 
gave her some paintings. She was selling those 
painting, and carpeting, and th is what she 
lived on. So -- and by that time,
 after the war, she was as  
poor as I was. She had two 
girls, unhappy. S -- 
Q: When  you were on the ship
, did you -- were you thinking
 much about wh
at kind of 
life you were heading toward s, and wh at y
ou wanted it to be? And wh at was the mood 
among th e passengers? 

A: The mood of them, the passenger, was quite 
optimistic, because they™re finally going 
to a new country, they™re going 
to a new country. So, was op
timistic in itself this -- be 
trying so mething new, and -- and I happen to 
like challenges. I love challenges. I like to 
try something new. I try anything which I didn™t try before
. And -- and scary. What™s 
going to  be with me? What going to be with? I 
don™t speak English, I have no job, I have 
no profession, I have no money.
 What™s going to  be? I have a sister in Canada, how do I 
going to  help her? An d this was ma -- always
 predominantly in my
 mind, is how do I 
going to  help my  sister. And that™s the r
eason I took a job -- a we -- we -- job for 60 
hours, with eating one salami sandwich. 
Q: Do you remember other first 
impressions of -- of New Yo rk? 
A: Yes. The huge, huge building, and I said, 
ﬁThey never have sun he
re.ﬂ I was f -- I felt 
always sorry for the people who live -- he -- 
down on bottom. He took me to Wall Street, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
50
 
 
 
 
 
or something, the seco nd or third day. And I 
said, ﬁLook at this. Th
is wonderful country, 
and they  have never see sunshi
ne.ﬂ Always felt so badly this  is dark, they™re never going 
to see sunshine. I never knew th ey go to wo
rk from -- fro m somewheres else, to  the Wall 
Street, but I thought they lived there, and 
everything is happen there. And okay , the --  
that second day, we bought me a new suit in 
Ripley™s, was the thing, and this is my first 
suit. And three or four days later, I got the j -- 
I too -- she took me to 
the ot -- as I said to 
RKO, and it offered me the job, wh ich I 
didn™t want. So I got a job for S. Klein 
department stores, 60 hours, 
and after two weeks, I beca
me a supervisor, not even 
speaking English, but I had an
 interpreter with me as a -- as a supervisor. Became 
supervisor of receiving and shipping,
 in departments store of Kleins. 
Q: How was your relationship with  your fami
ly here? Did they ask you about what had 
happened during the war? Did yo
u f -- want to talk about it? 
A: They did not want to know too mu ch, and 
I was not ready to ev -- reveal myself. I -- I 
didn™t feel like exposing my
self. You know, the -- the -- the 
-- the -- that was tredding me 
-- they were treating me with 
-- wi-with very -- kindness, they
 treating me with kindness, 
thas I, only one surv ivor, except 
-- except for my sister
 there. So they were very kind to 
me, very kind. B-Bu t you know, they never 
achieved anything tremendous in their live. 
One [indecipherable] was a -- 
was a ma ilman. The other one was a -- the other brother, 
which worked for my father, 
those two boys, was a ped -- a -- a -- a peddler something. 

And the oldest brother, which wa
s -- by the way, they are not true brothers, they™re not -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
 
th-they™re step-brothers, all 
step-brothers, except the aunt
 which I lived there, and the 
uncle wh ich sponsored me. She only had one 
true sister, and one true brother. All the 
other ones were step-sisters, because my mo
ther™s mother died in -- during childbirth 
with my mother. So, he  married couple da -- years later, 
sister. And since the babies was -
- the two girls and a boy was so small, so th
ey never knew this -- they were not telling 
them about that, they found ou
t after they got married, after my  mo ther got married, she 
found out. So he -- he only was a dental mechan
ic. So, none of them wa
s -- is -- is -- they 
lived in a middle class milieu. Aspi
rations, so-so. No big aspirations. 
Q: What about other friendships, rela
tionships, encounters with people? 
A: I -- I -- I -- let me tell you so mething. I lived
 there for awhile, and after this, I -- I felt 
that™s -- that™s only -- the 15 dollars I had to pa
y, or something, I said I try to get myself, 
it™s a little better. I befriended a 
lady who was the cousin of 
Heddy Lamar. And she says -
- also helped me, and she says, ﬁWhy don™t
 you get out, because you™re goin g to be 
stifled there. You™re staying there stifled. 
Fifth floor walk-up, bad, bad.ﬂ The -- that 
neighborhood was getting 
bad. So I got a job -- I -- I got a -- myself a apartment in a 
brownstone ons -- on River Ave, between Br
oadway , and West End Avenue, next to the 
Ansonia Hotel. So I did quite well, I mean th
at it™s -- the money whic
h I st -- fer -- to -- 
15 had to  pay out, that paid for my rent, and 
I did quite well. I liked it, and I ma de friends 
there, I made friends. And after this I was draf
ted in the army, after draft in the army, so I 
had to give up ev erything else, 
so I didn™t have anything else. And, matter of fact, she 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
 
was the only one who wrote -- used to write me
 almo st -- every two, three days, and her 
fam -- her family did not. Didn™t do it. 

Q: Were your fr -- were the friends that 
you were making mo stly Jewish, non-Jewish, 
Holocaust survivors, or -- 

A: Very little friends, very few friends. I had 
a problem at that time, which was because 
of my accent. I had a fellow which I came 
here together on a ship, which is called 
something Zimmerman, so I was 
friendly with him. But he m
oved down  to Coney Island, 
in New York, Coney Island. I lived on Broadway, so we drifted apart. He had a 

profession right away , he was a carpenter, so 
he did quite, quite well, and I didn™t have 
any profession, I was a perpetual student. So, 
I made friends afterwards, we made friends. 
But not too many friends. Let™s put it this -- we had acquaintances -- I made 

acquaintances. I had -- didn™t make a
ny friends, I made acquaintances. I had 

acquaintances, but no friends. 

Q: I guess if you joined the army, th
at you mu st have become a s -- 
A: I did not join, I was drafted. 

Q: You were drafted. You were drafted. 

A: It™s a difference. 
Q: Important difference, important distinction. Were you a citizen of the United States? 
A: No, no, I was not a citizen. 

Q: They drafted you -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
 
A: I had a tentia -- I -- in -- I -- I applied, 
because I came as a -- as p o litical escapee, 
intention to become a citizen. I w as drafted.
 And I was one of the older ones, already, 
they usually draft 18 -- 19 year old, I was in
 the 20™s already. So
 the f -- go -- the army 
was a revelation to me, it was a revelation to th
 -- but I -- I survived 
it. I made it. I made 
it. Especially in my  basic training, I had this
 incident with Dr. Do
 -- with Dr. Deutsch -- 
with Deutsch, so it left a -- a bi -- I became 
more cautious -- I beca
me mo re c a u tiou s, so  
the only thing to -- to -- to be 
in my own milieu, I became activ
e in the Jewish temple in -
- in the army base, with Judais
m, so at least I felt a certain 
amount of kinsmen, who going 
to feel this -- what I have 
been through is -- 
and not to make fun of my  language, 
whatever it was. 
Q: Did you have any symp athy for the 
American cause in the Korean war? 
A: At that time I didn™t know about the -- th
e Korean -- the -- the 
reason of th e Korean 
war. I didn™t know it. So -- so I knew the 38
th
 parallel, I k n ew it -- whatever it was, so I -- 
I was apolitical. I just came, two years, I was apolitical. 
Q: Did you become more po
litically inclined later on? 
A: Since then? Yes, I became mo re politically
 inclined. I go for Demo
cratic causes, even 
I registered independent, because I still have
 an independent mind, 
and usually, most of 
the time, w ho I vote for doesn™t get in. So 
-- so my -- my re -- election -- my voting 
record is not one of the best ones. Usually I 
take the cause which is not too popular, yes.

Q: Was there any particular event that -- that
 drew you into politics,
 or was that just a 
gradual thing, I -- do you remember earlier -- early -- 
A: You know, I think the politi -- politics i-i-i-
i-is the spine of the nation. I mean, the 
spine of nation. Look what is 
going on the -- let™s take 1999 
and 2000. With all the killing 
what™s going on by people w
ith guns, we can™t even pass a gun control law. I mean, it™s -- 
it™s terrible. So sometime I feel
 a small, autocratic nation, 
a small autocratic philosophy, 
is not the worst thing in the wh
ole world. Democracy is terrific,
 what it stands for now, to 
-- quoting Mr. Churchill, he said, ﬁDemocracy
 is only good right now, because we don™t 
know of anything better.ﬂ But if you take Helle
nistic culture, the dest
roying of Hellenistic 
culture was democracy, becaus
e everybody was right. And now we have atoks the Fifth 
Amendment. Fifth Amendment is your right to
 arm, it™s not true, doesn™t say that, Fifth 
Amendment doesn™t say that. You™re allowed 
to bear arms for th
e militia. We have a 
militia, it™s called the National Guard. You k
now the militia thas I goi
ng to shoot at him, 
he™s coming thro ugh my  door today, and I™m 
allowed to have a gun. We have to be 
educated. There™s nobody more armed in thewhole world than it is in Israel. Almost 
everybody had a rifle every -- 
but the killing is not there. 
So it seems like we have to 
educate not only wh at the gun stands for, but 
what the gun can do. But here we just -- yo 
-- the last two days we got a 
six year old child -- killed a si
x year old boy. A six year old 
boy killed some s-six year old child. This fell
ow killed yesterday, because he doesn™t like 
the white people, killed three people. And we ca
n™t pass a gun control law. We can™t even 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
55
 
 
 
 
 
pass a law to put a -- a governor on a gun. So 
this reason -- we have to be involved. Being 
gun control, being eq ual right
, being pregnancy, being wh at
ever it is. I mean, w h ere does 
it -- where does it -- my philosophy, where does th
e Senate, the House, or the --  the -- the 
state has a right to go in to my  wife™s be
droom? Or anybody™s bedroom? Wh at you want 
to do with your body? I going to tell you y
ou can™t have an abortion -- you cannot have 
abortion. The people who have 
money, they  going to get abortion regardless. If they 
don™t get it here, they get it in Canada, they
 get it in Timbuktu, th
ey get it someplace. 
Only  that -- poor people have to get an a
bortion th rough a hanger. So you have to be 
involved politically. 

Q: When did you become a citizen? 
A: Five years later, 1952. 
Q: By then were you very in
terested in the American politic
al system, or aware of the -- 
A: I -- I™m in-interested in any sy stem. I™m in
terested in any sy stem
, I™m interested in 
Israeli system, I™m inte
rested in the Muslim system. I™
m -- matter o f fact, I™m studying 
the Koran for four years already. By the 
way, so far I didn™t understand wh at it™s 
happening there, b-baffling, comp letely baff
ling, because it™s contradicting statements, 

but any --  but -- but anyways, 
it™s -- it™s -- it™s the base of 
-- of a tremendous resurgence, 
and the resu rgence is -- is -- is -- is treme
ndous. In the whole civiliz
ed world, Muslims is 
-- is -- tremendous resurgence.

Q: So, you don™t necessarily cons
ider yourself to have an iden
tity as an American, or to -- 
to have a  particular -- 
A: Oh su re, oh sure, oh sure. 100 percent Am
erican, absolutely. Ab
solutely 100 percent 
American, and that™s the reason -- I tell you wh
y I feel 100 percent am -- because I have 
the right, and I have the privilege of criticiz
ing. And is a privilege
 you never have, no -- 
anyplace else. And that™s what 
I™m an American for, because 
I can say here what I don™t 
like. And this is a difference where I came 
from. Not through an 
-- in Czechoslovakia, 
now Czech Republic, I could do almost -- almo
st the same thing. But here I can say it 
without worrying about it. Can go in a 
corner and shout what I don™t like. 
Q: Do you ever do that? 
A: I don™t shout, but I tell you a little incident
 that™s -- there™s a se
f -- fellow comes to 
Kruschev , and says, ﬁYou know, we have -- 
you know what democr
acy is? Because I can 
go in  a corn er, and I can say my  president sti
nks.ﬂ He said, ﬁThis is democ -- I have the 
same thing. I go in my corner, 
I can s -- I can say the same th
ing, your president stinks.ﬂ 
That™s democracy. 

Q: So, du -- is voting partic
ularly important to you? 
A: Oh yes, yes. There™s a privilege which yo
u don™t get too often. 
No other count --  not 
have it a lot of them.  Now, it™s a much, mu
ch better, but wa -- biv -- ah -- my history, 
where I come from, n o , no, you be careful -- ev
en if you voted, you have to be careful 
who you voted for. This -- this is -- this is
 a wonderful, wonderfu
l place, wonderful. And 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
 
it™s only makes it wonderful because we can critic
ize it. We don™t have to be subservient, 
we don™t have to be -- be -- be whatever th
ey pushed down our th ro
at, we can voice an 
opinion. 
Q: Do you want to say anything else a
bout your experience in the army ? Were yo 
disillusioned at that point, with 
the whole thing, the whole system? 
A: No, I was disillusioned for a simple reason 
is, because I had to be regimented again. 
Being in  concentration camp, whatever you 
want to call it, you are regimented, because 
you had to get up, you 
had to do this, you had to do 
that. You were under cert -- the 
regiment, or -- or the superv ision. You c-
could not exercise your freedom any way you 
wanted it. Army did the same thing to me
. Actually, nobody goi
ng to kill me, nobody 
going to  deprive me of food. No body going to  t-
take me to shoot, or t-to gas me. But it 
was on the regiment, and I am a little rough to
 be regimented again, and that™s was the 
difference. I mean, I remember al
ways in army , I don™t know if I said it, I had to pick up 
food for my block, and I -- they hit me on my  behind. Did I ever say this story? No? I 
was block number, I think 18, or 17, or 27. 
I don™t know what number block oy. So we 
went to -- there was two of us, we went and 
br-brought -- two of us went for ke -- with 
the kettle. They gave us a wate
r with -- with -- with turnips 
or something. And this was 
the food for the day. 
They call us, hypothetical let™s sa
y, at twent -- I was block number 
27, he says 26 here? Fine. He 
says 27. I don™t say nothing, I 
didn™t get there yet. He says 
20 -- or he wants to say 28, I said, ﬁHere.ﬂ 
They says, ﬁPistrits -- I zeeman swansee, gor

actenswansee?ﬂ  I said, ﬁZ
eemen swansee.ﬂ  I was late. It 
took me -- this fellow took me 
to a -- not a kapo, the superv isors were also
 Jews [indecipherable]
 and put me between 
his leg, and my  head right here, and they ga
ve me 15 with a walkin g -- not him, with a 
walking cane, which was taped ar
ound with tape or somethi
ng, it shouldn™t split. And he 
gave me 15 on my  behind. The first one, two, thre
e excruciate, after this it™s -- it™s -- it™s -
- you did not feel it anyway s. I bled rectally
. [indecipherable] I™m fi
nish, I can walk -- I 
had to pick up -- he calls me  this, ﬁIt was 
forgot -- you s -- you fo rgot something.ﬂ ﬁWhat 
the hell did I forget?ﬂ He says, 
ﬁYou forgot to say thank you.ﬂ
 So I fainted,
 so they had 
big squares where they™re full of water, so in case of fire, they should use this water to 
thing -- so they threw me 
into this lake, because I forgot to say thank you. 
Q: I™m sorry, I got a little confused, cause I 
thought you were -- you did tell that story. 
A: I did? 
Q: Yeah. But I thought you we
re going to say something ab
out the army , and the y -- and 
the U.S. experience, but I understand now -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- you were saying the regimentation. 

A: It™s the regiment -- the regimentation, yes. 
Q: Did you have any othe
r anti-Semitic experiences? 
A: Asibido -- since Deutsch, I 
had one of them, it had to do -- in -- in San An tonio, I had 
one of thing is, one fellow. As I said, it was 
a integrated company, 
so they were playing 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
 
cards, and they said, ﬁYou Jewing me down.ﬂ 
Not to me. He said in the camp, this was -- 
I just -- we just came transferred 
to there. I said, ﬁFellows, let 
me tell you, I happen to be 
Jewish. I happen to be Jewish.ﬂ So, they is
olated me a little bit, but ventually it was 
forgotten, was forgotten. [ind
ecipherable] had no problem.  
Q: Did you form any friendships during th at time? 

A: I va -- did form friendship with a fello
w by -- Don Dimarino. He a butcher from 

somewheres, as unhappy as I was, because he wa
s also drafted late. So we only formed a 
friendship in the army , but noth ing afterwards. 
Afterwards I came h ere, to mak e a living, 
and so after this, we lost each other. Fu
nny thing, I still remember this name. 
Q: How long were you 
in the army, just -- 
A: 16 months or something like this, I was th
ere. Matter of fact, of -- it sounds almost 
impossible. They knew I was in the CIC, wanted
 to put me in the CIC, and I should go to 
the papers CIC, so that could -- they goin
g to use me in Korea. My face doesn™t look 
Korean at all. So I don™t know who ever th
ought to send me to Korea to do spying. I 
mean, it™s crazy, but you know, so
mething that -- papers got fouled up, and that™s what it 
was. So that™s the reason I wou
nd up a surge -- as a surgical tec
hnician, to go to Korea, in 
a hospital. 

Q: When you -- you came to 
the United States in -- aroun
d ™48, isn™t that right? 
A: ™47. 
Q: ™47. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064

A: April first, ™47. Fool™s day. 
Q: Were you following at all the -- the -- th
e subsequent nur -- Nu remb erg Trials were 
happening near that time, and there wa
s a trial against the Krupp factory. 
A: Yes, I worked for Krupp. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I work ed for Krupp, yes. I followed  it, 
and I didn™t follow it. I tell you why, because 
emotionally I was drained. Emotionally I was 
drained. So, actually, I -- less I fo llowed -- 
I f-found I came here for a new life. I mean, th
e past doesn™t going to  do noth ing for me. 
Matter of fact, people are getting money from
 Germany. I didn™t get -- I didn™t have 
anything to do with them. I didn™t get any mone
y for 50 years. I just started receiving it 
the last one year. My sister™s
 getting it for 50 years, I never, 
ever few -- I did nothing to 
do with it. I just didn™t want to
 live through my past. Matter of fact, I was more interested 
in the ass-assassination of President Kennedy.
 And I read the Warren  Report, and I was 
more interested things
 which happen now, which I am so
 -- here, where I have something 
to do about it, where I have
 something to say about it. 
In-In-In-In-In the German war, I 
was a pawn, I was just a pawn, and I™m glad wh
at I did, that sabotage wo rk, wh ich I did, 
blowing up trains. It g ave me a certain satisfac
tion, but in retrospect, I just made a speech 
for some newspaper editors, and newspaper artists
, and I said to them -- was last year, or 
two years ago. And I said to 
them, ﬁYou know something? So
metimes I slee -- during the 
night I get up, and I says, yo
u know, you killed somebody™s ch
ild.ﬂ And then one of the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
61
 
 
 
 
 
fellows said, ﬁYou know, I felt the same  wa
y.ﬂ I don™t know if it™s comp assio -- what 
about a chi -- ki [indecipherable] was -- I kill
ed somebody™s child. Now let me  tell you an 
incident what happened to me two years ago. I 
go around -- I used to 
go around -- used to 
go around, make speeches about 
the Holocaust, and it™s either
 the -- the -- how it™s Hitler 
came to power, the German 
push on Munich, push. Landsbe
rg, and -- and vay -- Hitler 
with ﬁMein Kampf,ﬂ and ha -- Rudolf Hess, ev
erything else. So before -- this was in 
Lakewood Community  Co llege in Lakewo od, wh ic
h is part of the Fl
-Florida University. 
So before I start the sp eech, I usually say,
 ﬁDoes anybody know 
what the Holocaust 
means?ﬂ There are three girls -- three girls, 
one black, and two white girls raise their 
hand. I pick ed one of them who looks -- who 
looks Jewish, something like this. She looks 
Jewish. No problem is she goi
ng to know what the Holocaust
 mean s. I says, ﬁYes, young 
lady, wh at is the Holocaust?ﬂ She says, ﬁE
thnic food.ﬂ You™re making a face? That™s 
what she said. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
A: So sh e said it™s ethnic food, and it™s extrem
ely disappointed since then. I feel when we 
take the children to the Ho lo caust mu seum, and I -- and I think it™s -- since you are 
work ing there, I wonder if you ever observed, 
when th ey walk out, they make, tch, tch, 
tch, tch. It™s leaves an effect, and after is 
always feels better, we going to eat now. I mean, 
I don™t know how lo ng emotion stays with 
them. They should made a study, how long 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
 
emotion stays with you, if it doesn™t touche
s you extremely personally, you know, father, 
mother, cousin, something. When you see a 
strange mass of people, eight million, s-six 
million, 25 million. It™s
 only a number. History teaches us it™s not the first Holocaust we 
went thro ugh, not in th is scope, but we know 
tha -- wer -- were that -- to sin -- crusifi -- 
to Crusades, because French Huguenots, th
ere™s a Christian killing Christians, almost 
everybody. The Turks we
nt all the way up to Vienna, th
ey killed mercilessly. We went 
down to the -- two Crusades, we
 killed everybody who came in 
our way. So you see, so -- 
so this Holo caust is repeated
 itself, only in  bigger scope. And I always wonder, is if you 
talk about it, it™s only eventual
ly  going to  be a sentence in a new -- in the history books. 
You know, there was a Holocaust, 35 million 
people died, 25 million people died, six 
million Jews is gonna die, and that™s all what
 it is. I™m a very much
 involved now with 
the Holocaust survivors here, right here wher
e I live, but you know, now, as a matter of 
fact, just recently went to a meetin g, and 
somebody said somethi
ng about the Holocau -- 
he says, ﬁOh, we here to have good times.ﬂ 
S ee, even the Holocaus
t survivors don™t want 
to dwell of what happened. He says, ﬁWe ve -- 
have a life, now let™s have -- let™s think of 
good times.ﬂ So I don™t know where to we -- history going to tea -- what history going to 
think of us. Maybe th e mu seum going to stay
 for some time, like sa
me thing Mu seum of 
National History, says, you kn
ow we -- how the Indians lived, and how th e Neanderthal 
man lived, and how the Elsie lived, and th
e -- maybe we going to  be just a little 
[indecipherable]. I went to Prague, there™s 
a gorgeous, gorgeous synagogue, wh ich called 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
 
the Portuguese synagogue, which 
is gorgeous. Hitler left it inta
ct, because he said, ﬁAfter 
all the Jews are destroyed, this going to  be
 a show, the museum how the Jew -- t h ere was 
a race, by the name of Jews.ﬂ And he left it. 
And that™s all. And we were eventually going 
to be the Holocaust, I feel goi
ng to be, you know, there was 
a -- a Holocaust, there was a 
-- a -- a darkness over Europe, which -- caused by
 one man, and his organization. It™s sad.  
Q: Do you feel that -- that it™s possible 
that such a thing could happen again? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. We have a little bit now
, if you can taste it in Vienna, in Austria. I 
mean, get rid of the refugees. So  today we get 
rid of the refugees. Just five years ago, we 
-- Germany invited, in 1948, 
they invited the Tu
rks as laborer. Now, we putting a wall 
around them where they live. Now, by -- afte
r 50 years, 50 years is two generations, now 
we want to get rid of them. And if they™re 
not the Turks, tomorrow 
going to be the blue 
eyed people nec -- day after th
e blondes, or the day after, the Jews. No, I mean the -- the 
finest -- the finest example, north Vienna. A
nd th is whole opero going to die down . Even 
Israel [indecipherable] ambassador, he even
tually going to  come back . Cause it™s an 
internal struggle. Same thing we don™t 
make [indecipherable] what™s go -- going in  
Koso vo. We killing Serbians, we -- we killin
g the Russians, we [indecipherable] the 
Muslim, we killing wa -- and the sa -- Russian said
, ﬁOh, this an intern al struggle.ﬂ   So 
too Vienna going to  say, Au stria going to sa
y, ﬁThis is internal struggle, don™t meddle 
in.ﬂ So we have it all over the world. We
 have approximately 
10 to 15 wars going on 
constantly, wherever in the 
whole world. Being Pakistan, 
being Nigeria, being Zamb ia, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
 
be wh erever it is. People are dying. And wh at do we
 say? Tch, tch, tch, tch. That™s all that 
we do. 

Q: Can you talk about your i
nvolvement with survivor orga
nizations? You just mentioned 
something. 

A: Yeah, survivor organizations is -- we -- 
matter of fact, we just erected a monument 
here. We -- oh -- we had a monument here to 
-- to the Ho-Holocaust
 survivors, they 
vandalized it. In here, where 
99.9 people are Jewish, it™s a 
closed community, you have to  
have a gate to come in, somebody vandalized it.  

Q: Right here in Boca Raton? 

A: Right boc -- in Century Village. They broke 
it apart. I think they were young kids who 
come here on th e Christma s vacation, they  have 
nothing else to do, so
 they did it. So we 
just got it -- we -- we just -- matter of
 fact, the dedication going to be the 26
th
, of a new 
memorial. Yes. The -- we -- we -- there™s not
 much to be done, we -- we -- we giving 
money to -- to Wiesenthal, I -- which I belong 
to Wiesenthal Center. So that™s what I do, 
I got -- belong to the Wiesenthal Center, try 
to help financially, nothing else I can do. 
Q: Is there a large commun
ity of survivors here in 
this area where you live? 
A: As big a -- bigger than I thought, bigger th
a-than I thought. I never knew it, because I 
don™t -- I have a lot of friends, which I neve
r seek he has to be 
a Holocaust survivor. 
Lately, I just -- thanks to the organization,
 I made some wonderf
ul, wonderful friends. 
And they  all survivors. I have other frie
nds too, which are Americans, but they™re 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
 
survivors. And they™re wonderful people, they™re
 such optimists, such 
won -- full of life. I 
mean, they live each day fo-fo
r life™s sake, you know? And th ey don™t dwell whatever 
happened  yesterday. That™s yesterday, it™s -- 
forget it. I mean, yesterday™s a long story. 
Only tomorrow or today. So, 
they wonderful, wond
er people. They ve
ry positive people. 
It™s nice, very nice. 
Q: So when you get together, you 
don™t necessarily talk about it? 
A: No, nobody talks -- 
no, nobody talks about 
it. Only [indecipherable
] ta lks, my sister . 
But you know, we don™t -- not -- not. You kn
ow, everybody has a s -- little bundle of -- 
he carries his little bundle, which is not pleasant. Everybody lost somebody, e-every day 

is not -- one of them whose -- who -- who -- 
who went through the war without a scrape. 
He being bruised a little bit mo
re, being bruised a little b it less, but everybody s -- is 
bruised.  

Q: When  did you -- I know that y-you were 
married. Wh-W hen did you meet your wife, 

and do you want to say some
thing about your children? 
A: I don™t like to talk about 
it, I -- because I met her, an d I got married, and I was married 
in 1951, and divorced after 41 years, and I™m
 extremely happy. I have three wonderful 
children. It was a little bit ro
ugh with my children, the -- 
vis a vis my divorce, but it™s 
worked out quite, quite well. 
I have wo nderful, now six gr
andchildren, so I™m quite 
happy the status quo wh ich I have right now.  

Q: Do you want to say so
mething about your children? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
 
A: My children, they™re wonderful. By -- th
e oldest daughter is Debbie. Husb  -- her 
husband is Ira, who is a -- is a partner in Er
nst and Young. Has two lovely ch ildren, na -- 
named Stacey, who is in college in Maryland, 
and Michael, who just broke his arm s -- 
board  skiing. My son David, and Beth, they
 work for the state 
-- for the -- the Def-
Defense Department, the pentagon. Two lo ve 
-- lovely, lovely boy 
is Brian and Scott. 
They  live in Virgin ia. My youngest daughter D
onna, is married to --
 is -- is -- sh-she 
worked for -- for Sprint, but now sh
e just had a baby, February, the 11
th
, and her husband 
is Ray Elia Elan, and they have two little girls.
 One little girl is a big girl, and -- and she 
has one little girl, Emily, and now Daniel. My 
youngest -- si-sixth grandchild. Matter of 
fact, all my  children are named after my mo
ther. My mother™s name was Dora. All of 
them have a D. 

Q: Did you m-make a point of speaking with
 your children at a
ll about your -- your 
history? 

A: I spoke to my children as 
little as possible. Matter of fa
ct, I gave the tape, which I 
made for the Holocaust last tim
e, and I made for Spielberg. 
My youngest -- my  youngest 
daughter, and my middle son, they saw it. 
My oldest daughter has it, never saw it. 
Doesn™t want to -- she said she cannot liv
e through it, which I can understand quite 
readily. Same thing my  sister. She never would 
look at it. Doesn™t want to look at it. 

Q: But you told -- do you -- do
 -- you mentioned you do talk w
ith your sister about that 
history. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
 
A: She talks to me about it. She talks to me
. I try to avoid it as paw -- paw -- we talk 
about -- funny thing is -- to my sister, we get 
togeth er, and we talk each other ev ery sing -
- I call her nine o™clock precisely every single 
day, so long sh e™s in Florida. After this, I 
call her every fri -- every Saturday in Toronto.
 Funny thing, our hist
ory starts from birth 

to concen tration camp, never at -- in concen
tra -- never talk about concentration camp, 
with -- and after, where we fo
und each other. But we never ta
lk th-this life in between. 
We always talk the good stu
ff, like -- li -- like th
e concentration camp never happened to 
us. Like, we™ll be stopped at -- at -- at 19 f -- ™
39, to -- our history stopped. So, we try -- I 

try to be, and sh e is, or try to be as positiv
e as possible, but she always brings up, you 
know, what happened. So
, she carries the guilt, a lot [indecipherable] 
Q: So, did you ever feel the need to find so me
 way to -- to mourn for your parents? Or in 

-- for your brother, too? You mentioned that 
you didn™t cry during the war, did you cry 
afterwards? 

A: I cried afterwards. I cried afterwards. Es
-Especially with my mo
ther. Funny thing is, 
she was a wonderful, wonderfu
l woman. And my father was -- it™s was -- he was always 
a business, so -- so relation was a limited time
 r-relation thing, except when I went skiing 
with him in the wintertime. But I found him, 
he was a very, very -- more I think of him, 
more I admire him. M o re I admire him as a 
man, as a father, as a -- oh, as a -- a 
breadwinner, as everything else, 
which, as a youngster, at that
 time, did not appreciate it. 
What -- this what I missed him.
 But during the camp, I -- I 
didn™t have to, because I knew 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
 
that -- I saw the chimneys. Th
ey said, ﬁYou see you -- this 
where you gonna wind up.ﬂ It 
was the best propaganda, gonn
a wind up. The only
 thing you wa -- didn™t want to wind 
up su ffering til you get there. So -- so, whatever 
it is, I -- I knew I going to wind up. So -- 
so it was only a s -- matter of time. But longer 
you stay there, all of a sudden you said, 
ﬁWhy should -- I don™t want to die. I want 
to take advantage.ﬂ I 
-- I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I 
want to -- not take advantage, I -- I want to 
-- how you say -- I want to -- to take whatever 
it is, I forgot it. I want to hate him as much as
 I could. I wanted to take -- and that™s what 
I wanted to do. So, it -- the reason is, when I 
was for the underground, the CIC, I mean, I 
became a specialist at railroad thing. So I t
hought I was a hero, killing those boys. I was 
killing ruvaba -- blowing 
up those railroad, and being a -- 
playing spy. Oh, this was quite 
challenging, you know. Giving a -- the reports. 
So -- so -- so that one was -- I got even. 
That™s what I wanted to -- that™s what I wa -- 
sorry. This what I want to say, I wanted to 
get even with them. Co
uldn™t think of it. 
Q: But did you -- do you have 
any way of -- of -- of -- do you have any special dates that 
you -- that you memo rialize your parents,
 or do you -- do you do anything -- 
A: I -- I do not memorialize them. I do not me
morialize them, because I called -- I asked 
a rabbi if I should -- I should
 do so mething for them, you know, pray or something, is 
there some -- or light even a 
candle for them. And the rabb
i says, since you don™t have 
definite date of their demise, you cannot do it,
 you cannot do it. So -- so -- they got to -- 
they [indecipherable] in my life, this -- they
 were cremated, in my wish I going to be 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
 
doing th e same thing. My sister™s very mu ch  ag
ainst it, my family™s against it. But I feel I 
owe them so much, is I want 
to go the same way. So my  
mind is ma de up, though, fo r 
now, for quite some time. I want to go the sa
me way. I -- I just want to feel a certain 
kinship with  them. 
Q: You mentioned that during the camps you -- you 
lo st your fear of death. In your first 
interview. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Di -- is that something that 
stayed with you, or do you feel
 that -- not afraid of death? 
A: I™m not afraid of death. I -- I -- as 
I™m getting older, I would love to live longer, 
because I have a wonderful time. I have -- I ha
ve a ball. Every morning I get up, I always 
say, ﬁYou got it made,ﬂ and I read those thr
ee signs which I have in the kitchen. And I 
said, ﬁLife is worth living. Life is a wonde
rful, wonder commodity.ﬂ
 I don™t know if you 
can call it commodity, but it™s -- it
™s so much to offer, it™s so 
mu ch to do. You only have 
to grab it, it™s right there. I mean, I have a fri
end of mine, he says he
 killed another day. I 
said, ﬁHow can you kill another 
day? For me the day is too sh
ort, and you trying to kill a 
day.ﬂ I mean, it™s f -- that™s the reason I tried 
to postp one it, whatever happen, as long as I 
can, as long I can, it™s -- it™s a wonderful, wonderful thing. 

Q: What do you love to do? Wh at
 are your interests, and your --  
A: No, I -- I do charity. I do charity. I -- I -- I gi
ve charity. I belong to the organizations, I 
belong to another organization which called Habilitation, 
which takes care of mentally

challenged people. Matter of fact, we just give
 -- the -- the -- January, we just give 45,000 
dollars. Usually we give 25 and 25, but seems 
like we had some more money, so we give 
45,000 dollars, it™s a wonderful 
organization. These people 
who are challenged mentally, 
so they -- they -- they have a 
big place here, so they do -- 
like General Electric gives them 
something to put together, or -- or tell 
little plants, they 
plant plants. This 
[indecipherable] organization. I belong to the 
Holo caust organization. I go to  school five 
times a week. So, I lectur
e. So my day is full. 
Q: You go to school as a 
student, or as a teacher? 
A: As a -- I go a stu -- as -- as a student, as 
a -- I go to school as a student, plus as a 
teacher. I take a -- I take a -- well, let me tell yo
u what I take. I take th
is current events on 
Tuesday. I take -- this -- this
 semester, interesting court cases. Matter of fact, we taking 
now James Joyce, ﬁUlysses.ﬂ  You read ﬁUlysses
?ﬂ It™s interesting. I take i -- from -- from 
the Inquisition to Century 
Village. I take a -- a -- 
Q: From the Inquisition to Ce
ntury Village, what™s that? 
A: From the Spanish Inquisition in 1492, to --
 to -- you know, to coming to America, so 
he just gave it the title. 

Q: Looking at the history of -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- of the Jews? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064

A: From Jews coming to America, Jews comi
ng to America. A -- I take a current events 
history, German out of tolsto -- with Nazi
sm -- study Nazism. T
ook one -- took a course, 
Portugese Jew, Span ish and Po
rtugese Jews, especially talk
 about the -- the -- not -- the 
Sephardic Jews. So this is in a lecture, 
still a lecture, the Holocaust. I did it in high 
schools. This ex -- the experience I had in 
Lakewo ods, which was very unpleasant for 
me, so I™m not very positive about thos
e things. Well, so that™s what I do. 
Q: The experience in Lake
 Worth is that the -- 
A: Is the college which the 
girl says the ‚ethnic food.™ 
Q: What hap -- what hap -- what did 
you do or say after she said that? 
A: No, I didn™t -- we skipped it, I skipped it. 
Matter of fact, it was -- a good thing out of 
there was, on the faculty, ther
e™s a man from Lithuania, and 
he was very impressed with 
my speech, so he came over to me, and says, 
ﬁI™m not Jewish. My father lee is not 
Jewish.ﬂ Matter of fact, I became an ardent 
-- he became a born again Catholic. He said, 
ﬁI want to give you something wh ich I never s
howed to anybody else. My father is out of 
Lithuania.ﬂ Some city in Lithuania. ﬁAnd here
 is a printer™s list of
 all the Jews which 
were deported from Riga -- from Riga.ﬂ July th
e fourth , or something, and  he gave me 
the printed list, which I subm
itted. And he says, ﬁDo me a favor, don™t tell -- give them 
m-my  father-in-law™s name, don™t give my  name. Give it as you giving it as aﬂ -- so I 
mailed it to -- I spoke to somebody over 
there, I ma iled them the list, which the 
Holo caust Museum has it. A couple of weeks la
ter, I™m b -b-back there,
 so he says, ﬁI --

my  -- I spoke to my  father, he would like to
 have his name giv -- as a donor to the 
Holocaust Museum.ﬂ So I called them up, an
d they ch anged the name, thus he became 
the donor of those documents, which I have a 
copy of them right here. Came to  -- plus I 
was involved in s -- with the 
-- Spielberg. I did the hash 
-- HaShoah, also with them. 
Q: How were you involved with  them? 
A: With spiel -- I made the -- 
the -- hash -- HaShoah, the -- 
the -- I made the videotape, 
yes.  
Q: And when you go, and yo
u do these lectures, do you 
ever speak ab
out your own 
experiences, or are you mo re talking ab out general experiences? 
A: Yeah, most of -- no, I -- I s -- I -- I -- 
there™s according who I speak -- I just did a 
speech in a temple for y
oung youngsters. I tried to be not 
-- I tried to be less graphic. You 
know, I™d -- I leave out the horror stories, I 
-- I just in general -- general suffering, I 
mean, cause my  worst experience was when  I 
stood next to the Nazi
, and he threw this 
child against the wall. I mean, I don™t -- leave 
those out, I leave out that I was hit on my  
behind 25 times. All those things
 I try to -- to leave out, because the children don™t have 
to be exposed to this graphic thing -- they see enough graphic killing  
in a movie. So -- so 
I try to [indecipherable] and later I have questionnaires, and th ey are amazing thing, they  
very, very intelligent questions
. Somebody -- those questions are baffling me, but they™re 
very, very  bright children. 
Q: Can you think of any of th
e questions that they ask? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
73
 
 
 
 
 
A: I don™t know any, but I have letters whic
h they send me. The ch
ildren send me   each 
letter I -- I answer. You know, if it hurt me be
ing there. How does it feel you lost your 
parents? Ho w -- how do you de
scribe how you lo se your parents? I mean, there™s no 
words to say, that™s strictly emotional. Pr
actically, they™re not here, boom, they™re gone. 
But the -- how can you describe emotion, what
 you feel all of a sudden? You -- you have 
a fa -- a nuclear of a family, and all of a sudde
n, you™re by yourself. 
Lost a sister, lost a 
brother. I never knew my  sister was alive. So 
I -- and all of a sudden
 they say, ﬁYou see 
the chimney, that™s where you go
ing to  wind up.ﬂ So  that™s not 
very pleasant. And, plus I 
blame myself, because if I wouldn™t be there 
-- if I wouldn™t be there August the third -- 
second, in  -- in -- in the Lo-L ódz ghetto, I w
ould be here -- I would be fighting them. So 
now you™re angry, we could have fought thos
e bastards, I mu st -- not allowed to say it 
[indecipherable] fought them, and here I™m -- 
I™m -- I™m -- I became a prisoner. So it was 
s -- I lived betwe -- I lived between two wo rlds
. Here -- here, I sabotaged trains, which I 
can™t tell th at to nobody. I got even with them -- them a 
little bit, and here I became a 
prisoner like anybody else, but I became a cook 
to  the Nazi -- to a 
Nazi, then -- then -- 
then -- in a camp, and so I 
survived better, and I met -- d id I tell you I met a -- a -- a 
husband of my  aunt? I™m sitting in Auschw
itz, and there™s a transfer coming out from 
Theresienstadt. And every tim
e it came from Theresiensta
dt, I wanted to know if 
anybody know the Sternberg. My
 mother™s name is Sternbe
rg, Dora Sternberg. So the 
man sits next to me, and he™s bewildered
, completely bewilder
ed. Needs a shave, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
74
 
 
 
 
 
extremely skinny. So I said, 
ﬁDo you know anybody by name
 of Sternberg ?ﬂ He says, 
ﬁYes, I just married one.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYou married a Sternber
g?ﬂ  Long story short, he 
married  my  mo th er o l d sp in ste
r, he married her. I met him, I gave him some potatoes, he 
disappeared. I met a u n cle of mine in -- 
for two hours. He married my aunt in 
Theresienstadt. 

Q: Did he surviv e? And your aunt as well? 

A: None of them. None of the -- 19 or 20 of th
em all perished in Theresienstadt. My gr -- 
my grandfather died before the war. My gran
dmother -- that™s the reason I went back to 
Teplice, I went back  to Theresienstadt
, to show my  ch ildren wh at happened. 
Q: How -- so you vis
ited Theresienstadt? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What was that -- can you describe that? 

A: Theresienstadt, it was extreme emotion. 
I -- I -- I wanted to 
be by my self. I didn™t 
walk with all -- I didn™t walk 
with my children, I stood be
hind them, walked ahead of 
them, because this was part of the history. I 
re -- never went back to tep -- to Auschwitz, 
and na -- no -- not to  any other camp . So th
is was -- I had a physical -- I was in  this 
physical milieu, where -- where I knew some
body of me -- something of me lived 
through the whole thing. So  it was s -- very 
[indecipherab le] unpleasant, very unpleasant, 
very emotional, very  emotional, very emotional. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
75
 
 
 
 
 
Q: How did you -- what prompted you to start 
talking about your ex periences in front of 
schoolchildren, and -- and so fo rth. 
A: No, first I never knew I ma -- I -- I could 
speak in front of pe
ople. First I thought 
maybe I™m shy, wh ich I -- by na
ture I™m not shy. And it started actually, with my  son. 
He™s -- he got in touch with th e Holo caust Mu
seum, and th is how the whole thing started, 
the ball started running. And I always felt th
is -- you have to -- you have to tell them. 

History should not wipe it away
, that™s never happened. Except
 that this incident, which 
happened to me in -- in
 -- in -- in Lakewood put a damp 
on me, I think. This girl, I mean, 
quite intelligent, college gra
duate, or college student, I mean, don™t know what the 
Holocaust is. Th-That™s a -- and this funny thi
ng is tha -- a -- a -- a -- it reminds me of a 
line for Jackie Mason, that he 
does in one of his monologue. He
 says they walk out of th e 
theater, the first they 
said, ﬁWant to eat? What do you want
 to eat? What do you want to 
eat?ﬂ And I felt the same thing, you know, 
people come out from the Ho locaust Museum, 
they said, ﬁTch, tch, tch, tch, where we goi
ng to eat?ﬂ Because, yo
u know, you -- nobody 
wants to be surrounded with 
so  much misery, with so 
much negativism. You know, 
[indecipherable] nobody wants to be in a cave 
in the dark all the time, you want to go out 
the sunshine. And I don™t blame it. And the -- th
e people who   in th
e -- in the Holocaust 
organization, they said, ﬁWe don™t want to he
ar problems, we want to have good times.ﬂ 
Because we cannot dwell on it, because more 
you dwell on it, more miserable you going 
to get.

Q: And yet, you think if you forg et it comp
letely, then you™re lia
ble to do it again. 
A: No, you cannot forget it. Th
at™s a -- it™s part of my nature, it™s -- b ecomes part of my 
nature, it™s part of me. It™s here. It™s -- wake
s me up. Everywhere I look, I have it. Made a 
statues of the -- a matter -- ma --  matter of 
fact, that™s -- my si
ster [indecipherable] 
ﬁThat™s enough of those paintings.ﬂ 
Q: So you have to kind of
 find a balance betw een -- 

A: It™s a -- it™s a -- 
Q: -- remembering it, a
nd not dwelling on it. 
A: -- it™s a -- how emotional I feel about it. 
Ab -- fo -- for all those years, for years and 
years, I was thinking, you know
, my  mo ther would be 70 year
s old, and my  father would 
be 71 years old, and my  mo ther would be 80 
years old, and my  father would be 81 years 
old. Now they over a hundred. 
So , it™s all of a sudden I let go of them. Even if they would 
be alive, they wouldn™t be alive now. So  I le
t go of them, finally I let go of them. For all 
those years, I couldn™t let go of them. [inaudi
ble] Now they  gone. [indecipherable] alive. 
Q: Going back to your early -- 
early years in the Un ited States -- do you want to take a 
break? 

A: No, I™m fine [indecipherabl
e] Would you like some soda? 
Q: When you first came to the United States, a
nd then, in those first years, we talked a 
little bit ab out your growing -- 
how you slowly became interested in political things. I™m 
wondering about your aw
areness of -- of some of the ma
jor political event -- and social 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
77
 
 
 
 
 
events that were happening, 
say in the 1950™s, and 1960™s. 
Were you aware o-of, or did 
you take a particular interest in -- in anythi
ng such as McCarthyism,
 or the Civil Rights 
Movement, or anything? 
A: I -- I -- I found that McCarthyism was a ba
d -- a dark st -- dark page of American 
history. A matter of fact, I 
was a lover of -- still is a 
lover of Harry Truman. Now 
everybody™s fashionable to thi
nk him as a great president. Bu
t I thought of Harry Truman 
a great president before h-he became fashi
onable to be -- be-became popular. I think th e 
McCarthy area, if they wouldn™t
 have television, if this wouldn™t be exposed, it wouldn™t 
be so prominent in th e public
 eye. I think we gave him 
an exposure which he did not 
deserve. And matter of fact, the one whom 
I™m mo stly angry against, was President 
Eisenhower, because they ask him to r-raise an
 opinion about John Mc
Carthy, he says he 
wouldn™t honor him to mention his name, whic
h I think was terrible, til we have a -- an 
attorney by the name of Welch -- think his 
name was Welch, where he finally said on 
television, ﬁSenator, don™t 
you have any shame?ﬂ And ther
e was finally, after this 
statement, there was a senator, I think McGo
vern, but Mc-something, he finally opened  
his mouth. Til then, he was quiet. Rory  Co hn 
was the s -- the -- the 
king of the century  at 
that time. Him and Mr. Shy, who were the 
underling of mister 
-- M r. McCarthy. And 
matter of fact, I was -- I just finished hi
s biography just -- not -- just finished it. 
[indecipherable] He says in thas he had a int -- homosexual encounter with general -- 

with -- with Edgar Ho over, and Cardinal Sp
ellman. So if you™re [indecipherable] you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
78
 
 
 
 
 
think of Hoover, him being in a girdle, a
nd long stockings, it™s [indecipherable] looks 
quite [indecipherable]. So, and th-they were 
the one who was -- governed  our country. 
And I feel if not television exposure, McCa
rthyism would not get these ugly co lors in 
American history. 
Q: What did you 
like about Truman? 

A: A no nonsense Truman. He was a no nons
ense Truman. Through the [indecipherable] 
he took out the -- the rail -- was it -- I thi
nk it was a railroad strike, he took out the 
unions. I think it was a railroad strike. He wa
s a no nonsense ru -- he shot from the hip. 
He was protective of his daughter, who alle
gedly had the bi -- she was a singer, which 
somebody criticized -- criticized he
r for bad voice, and he has a pres -- not as a president, 
he said -- he said it as a father, I -- I -- 
I think it was -- w a -- an honest man. He was 

honest man. Through this, his wife was anti-
Semitic. Because he ha
d a partner, a Jew by 
the name of Jacobs, who was in the haberdashe
ry store, they went Chap ter 11, or they 
went bankrupt, wh ich they paid  back aw -- 
everything. And Bess Truman never allowed a 
Jew to walk into her house. But this how 
it was, so everybody knew wh ere Bess Truman 
stood, but he was still a wonderful president,
 I think one of the honest one. Unfo rtunately, 
he was pushed into the job overnight, and 
I think if he would have a little bit more 
experience, the Pottsdam treaty would not be 
so advantageous to the Russians, as it was 
disadvantageous to the -- to the Americans, be
cause when they came 
to Prague -- before 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
79
 
 
 
 
 
Prague, and even my city of Teplice, 
they wouldn™t move fu
rther til the Russians 
occupied even Berlin. Otherwise we woul
d have been in Berlin before them.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of 
an interview with Beno 
Helmer. What happened 
after your -- your job with S. Klein departme
nt stores? How long did 
you stay with them? 
A: S. Klein department store, I -- I started in
 the receiving departme nt
, after this I became 
manager of the concession -- of the shoe de
partment. And, I thought, well, good job, I 
had a good job, I finally made almost a hu
ndred dollars a week, which was almost a 
hundred dollars a week. Moved to
 New Jersey, and was married 
at that time, andby then 
I had the opportunity to  buy a liquor store. 
A uncle of my  wife passed on, and I bought 
the liquor store, through comp lications with 
the fami lies. Anyway s, I bought the liquor 
store, and I had the liquor store for quite nu
mber of years, til I was stabbed, and I was 
held up, and that was after 20 some odd years in
 the liquor store. So  I finally sold it, and 
retired at age 53.  
Q: Say mo re about that incident. What happened? 

A: Somebody came into the store, and just 
by coincident, was a lunch time. I had two 
people, clerks. One of them went to -- getti
ng our sandwiches, othe
r one was a delivery. 
A young man walks in, and he wants -- which 
I knew, you -- a yo -- 
a young man which I 
knew from the neighborhood. Matter of fact, hi
s father was a deacon in the church , and 
he was a choirboy in  the church. And he want
ed to buy a -- something for his girlfriend. 
And he asked me to giftwrap the bottle for his girlfriend. He was 20 -- 22 years old. So 

after I wrapped it, he pulled out the long knife, 
and he says, ﬁIt™s hold-up.ﬂ I said to him, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
81
 
 
 
 
 
ﬁIf I go, you go with me.ﬂ And I wrestled 
him. No, first he stabbed me, and then I 
wrestled him. And I grabbed the knife by th e 
blade, and I cut my  tendon in th is finger, 
this rees -- my pinkie. From the middle jo int up is stiff, because they had to sew it 
together. And we caught him. He was out of th
e jail before I got out of the hospital. And 
the judge calls me, an d tells me
, ﬁYou know the father is a de
acon in the church , and he™s 
in -- a choirboy, what do you 
think is a,ﬂ -- secretary of th
e -- of the judge, ﬁwhat do you 
think is a fair sentence?ﬂ I was perplexed, ab
solutely perplexed. 
So I said the most 
stupidest thing, I said, ﬁWhat the good judge fe
els in his heart should be a fair sentence.ﬂ 
So anyways, he got out. 
Q: What -- did that make you bitter at all? 
A: No. Scared. After this I became scared. No
t long after this, it was a Friday night, and 
the -- the -- that -- and this was before closin
g time. I [indecipherable] two clerks, one of 
them goes on delivery, other one 
stays there,  and I was held up
. Pushed in th
e back door -
- back cabinet, and a woman an
d two men held me up with a gun. And he -- m-my  co-
work er l-l-l Larfim, had a ring, and he said, 
ﬁGive me the ring.ﬂ And he says no, so she 
slapped him. I says, ﬁGoddammi t, give them 
the ring, I mean life is more important.ﬂ 
Anyway s, we caught her. She spoke a pretty g
ood English. After this, we took her to the 
court, she didn™t speak English, she only sp
oke Spanish. I don™t 
know what happened 
with the case. Happened with the case, nothing.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
82
 
 
 
 
 
Q: You have clearly had more than -- th
an one could ev en  imagine, of negative 
experience. 
A: My share -- my share of excitement. No, it™
s not negative, a share of excitement. I had 
enough in this lifetime, share of excitement
, for no -- for 10 lifetimes. Yeah, nothing went 
placid, nothing went easy. Now it finally -- 
it™s finally -- you know, it™s pretty good now, 
now it™s placid, now it™s wonderful.  

Q: But you still have -- 
so you have an opti -- 
A: I™m laughing about it. Yes, yes, be pos
itive about it. I mean, if you dwell on it, you -- 
if -- if -- if I start [indecipherable] amount of
 negativism, I don™t get out of bed in the 
morning. Going to cover myself o v er the head
, because the wo rld is black. Bu t the wo rld 
isn™t black. Look at this, it™s gorgeous, it™s te
rrific, I have something to live for. I have 
wonderful children, I have a wo
nderful friend, wonderful gran
dchildren, to -- what else 
can you ask for? Life is gorgeous. That™s 
the reason I think my interview is a positive 
interview, nothing negative 
about it. Nothing negative. 
Q: What happened after -- after that incide
nt, and you -- you got 
out of the business? 
A: Finally -- finally, I s -- I -- I went to the 
-- went out of business, because my  son said, 
ﬁDad, you don™t want they should carry you out 
feet first.ﬂ So I went out of business, and 
you know, it™s -- hanging around 
wasn™t too good an idea, pl
aying golf, whatever it was. 
So -- so I got myself a job, and became a sale
sman for a -- for a whol
esaler of champagne 
and liquor out of -- matter of fact, he asked me
 if I want to get the salary, I said, ﬁNo, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
83
 
 
 
 
 
give me a commission.ﬂ So I did very, very we
ll. Matter of fact, if I got the big, big 
account, he took it aw
ay from me. I got the first m -- 
they -- the company first million 
dollar account, I got it, he took it away. He
 says, ﬁYou don™t like it, you can quit.ﬂ 
Anyway s, after two years, we decided we co
ming down to Florida. We already had the 
place in Florida, but used to rent it. So, I wa
s 62 years old, so I said, ﬁThat™s enough, let™s 
pack it in.ﬂ So we cam
e down here, and after this I got divorce. 
Q: I was curious, if you would say a little bit 
more about your -- the class that you took 
with Anna Freud, and what you were doing? 
A: Anna Freud? We di -- ch
 -- Anna Freud was a negative personality I™ve heard. She had 
the homosexual tendencies, was madly in love
 with her father, ha
d re-occurring dreams 
about being spanked by him. And I™ll tell you,
 I don™t know if this [indecipherable] 

because  his-historic-wise, we don™t know
 homosexual [indecipherable] lesbianism, 

where it™s come from. We have
 no proof. This manifests its
elf somehow, because we -- 
we take a test of twins, identical twins, gr
owing up in a family, th
e same milieu, one of 
them become homosexual, and the other one 
doesn ™t. So we don™t know if that has 
anything to do with jeans, with
 nothing. Anyway, she was. An
d I took classes w ith it, and 
I tried to do a little bit for th
e -- as I said, with the abused
 women, in th
e ho -- in the 
Lubovitcher. And -- but I had to make a living, and the liquor store was the best 

opportunity to make a living, wh ich I did 
quite well, bought a house. First house was, I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
84
 
 
 
 
 
think 130 dollars was the insu
rance, and -- and mo rtgage, and everything else, and I 
didn™t g -- sleep nights, didn™t
 know if I gonna make it.  
Q: So sh e was -- was she teach
ing the class that you took? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: What -- what was the course? 

A: Psychology. [indecipherable] 

Q: So you -- it sou -- I mean, you -- you were mentioning a little earlier, and maybe we 
should get this on -- oh, w-we did get this on 
tape, all the different classes  that you™re 
taking now. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And it sounds as if you have a 
really broad range of interests. 
A: I don™t know anything, but I know a little 
bit of everything, somehow, seem like. 
Because it -- I -- I go -- I™m inte
rested in a class in which I ta
ke, I™m interested in it, and I 
don™t go just as an observer. I -- I -- I make 
a point to know what th
ey are talking about. 
And if they talk some which I don™t know, I ma
ke a point of looking it up. So  I don™t just 
go in  and they said, you know th
is talk x, y, z, and I go out, the next week going be there 
is something else. I make a point to know wh
at they are talking about. So that™s the 
reason I enjoyed it, it™s -- it™s -- at
 least it™s a little   resear
ch I do at the same time. And 
I™m an ardent reader. I don™t read novels, I 
think the last novel I read was I don™t know 
what. I read history and biographies. So, a ma
tter of fact, now I™m reading -- I read two 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
85
 
 
 
 
 
books at the same time, by th
e way, because I™ve ga -- becau
se it™s -- most of t h em are 
dry books, so I -- I read--  
one of them has to do -- I™m 
reading now th-the Leaman 
family. No, no, I read the Warburg family, a
nd th e other one is ﬁThe Atomic Secret of 
Israel.ﬂ Interesting books. 
Q: Do you ever read
 about the Holocaust? 
A:  I have books on ‚em, but I don™t read 
them. Because my Holo caust was my Holo caust 
alone. It was my  Holocaust, and other people™s
 Holocaust is their Ho
locaust. It was not 
an universal Holocaust, it was universal plus 
individual Holocaust. What I went through, 
nobody went through. What they  went thro
ugh, I didn™t go th rough. So my  Ho lo caust 
was being -- seeing this child destroyed, throwi
ng -- ripping up a train, or -- or sighing -- 
saying to  this German there is a huntbigram
, or this fellow says, Par shiva zhija, and 

going finally after -- after the war, when millions
 are destroyed, going to Poland, and see 
they destroying those poor remn ants o-o-o-
of a -- miniscule remn ants of Judaism, and 
they killing us. Matter of fact, I am against th
at, too, the March for the Living. I™m all for 
it. March for the living. But I™m 
against it to go to Poland. Matte
r of fact, I give to holoca 
-- I belong here, and I quite an
 active member, in a 
-- in the Holo caust thing, and I give 
charity, but I always excluding -- excluding, re
peat it, excluding to giving fo r the March 
of the Living, if it goes to Poland. I don™t go
 there, cause I found 
out that they beha -- 
behaved during the war, and af
ter the war, worse than the 
Germans, worse thanthe 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
86
 
 
 
 
 
Germans. They did it for sheer 
-- sheer hate, without reason wh
at it was. And they didn™t 
do it because they followed orders, that
 was emotionally on their own part. 
Q: In your videotaped interview, you mentio
ned some work  that you were doing, I don™t 
know if you™re doing it any more, w
ith geriatrics, with elderly people. 
A: I u -- I u -- yes, I did geriatrics with elde
r people, except, since I had my  triple bypass, 
some of the wheelchair people th
ere, they were stubborn, they 
used to drag their feet. So 
it was a very hard thing for me to do, so the doctor advised me not to do so. I did -- I -- I 
volunteered in a canc -- cancer ward in hosp ita
l, which -- it™s quite, quite depressing. And 
after I went through all this operations, I don™
t want to -- I stay away from it. So I don™t 
do any volunteer for this. Nei -- nei -- 
nor the hospital, nor the geriatrics. 
Q: Tell me more about your 
work with -- now yo
u wo rk with mentally disturbed -- 
A: No, no, no, the mentally challenged, it™
s a difference, mentally challenged. It -- 
organization which is called Ha
bilitation, which is a charitable organization,    make a 
card parties, trips, cruises, what -- everything 
else. So we give money to the -- to there. 
So my -- my involvement™s only as becau -- it™s 
-- it™s -- it™s -- it™s strictly financially. 
Strictly financially, that™s all that I am 
doing. Because they -- the organization, the 
supervision of state, or whatever it is, so th
ey have supervision there, so it™s very little 
you can do for them, the only th in
g you can do it collect money, 
or try to raise money. So 
I became a lifetime member. 

Q: Was charity work -- was givi
ng to charity always important?

A: Char -- was -- oh yes, was -- let me tell y
ou so mething about my father, about charity. 
I don™t remember eatin g with -- in Europe, th
e main meal is lunchtime. Maybe have it a 
little reversed, the main meal is lunchtime, ou
r lunchtime is our suppertime. So the main 
meal is -- is lunchtime. I don™t remember th
as I had dinner with my  parents alone. This 
mean, my  brother, my  sister and I, and my  
parents. We always had two people -- two 
students, who couldn™t afford it, eat dinner 
with us -- or lunch wh ich -- with us. Never 
remember them eat -- we ate by ourself. Yes,
 the evening meal, but not lunchtime meal. 
Always have people. My father
 always emphasized charity. I do
n™t know if I told you in 
the tape this -- my  mo ther gave hundred  thous
and, or 10 thousand, 
lot of money to the 
Hungarian government when sh e tried to free 
my father, and Minist
er Beck. I told the 
story, so you know it, yeah. 

Q: So it™s because of that background, you
 think, that you became -- you became -- 
A: You have to give, y
ou have to  give, you have to give
. My father said, ﬁComes a time 
you have to pay back,ﬂ and 
I™m paying back . I™m paying ba
ck, I drive the people -- I 
drive -- we have here people are -- just s
upplementing income, whatever it is, so they 
drive people to the airports, or drive them 
to doctors. They™re being compensated for it. 
My friends, I drive for free. E-Exception, 
if they had somebody who drove them for 
money, I don™t drive them. I tell the other 
-- let them use the other fellow, who has to 
make a living. So I don™t want
 to take his livelihood away, 
so wh oever you had, let him t-
take you. Bu t if they had nobody, I drive 
them for -- you know, I do it gratis, I don™t 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
88
 
 
 
 
 
mind. But I wouldn™t take it -- anybody to  the ai
rport, or shopping if he
 gets -- if they had 
someb -- let™s say they have George, or wh at
ever they had, and th ey  pay George, so I 
don™t want to take his job aw ay, or whatever he makes. 
Q: But in a way, what™s striking to me is that
 it seems like you could have just said wh at -
- well, my father was talking about paying 
back, and th ose were different times, and I™ve 
seen how -- I don™t -- I™ve suffered so much, 
what do I have to pay back for? But you 
haven™t taken that attitude. 
A: I tell you, th-there™s a hardest word  in th
e English language is no. There™s the hardest 
word  of English language, and I cannot sa
y it. I cannot say it. It™s [indecipherab le] 
unfortunate I have two dinner appointment, be
cause I couldn™t say no to one. Thanks to 

you I gotta cancel one. I cannot say no. Get 
it? Matter of fact, I™m doing something new 
now. I -- in -- I™m installing telephones in all 
my friends bathrooms. A matter o f fact, the 
phone is not normal height, it™s quite low, becau
se I lost my best fri
end, I lost in the 
bathroom. If he would had have
 a telephone, he maybe would 
have been alive yet. And 
so I™m installing telephones low, so in case 
you™re on the floor, yo
u can reach the phone. 
And since we getting on in  age, 
you never know if we™d need
 it. So this became -- I™m -- 
I™m a telephone installer, too. 

Q: Let me ask you something, going back alittle bit, I -- I wanted to touch on you -- you 
told a funny story in  your vi
deo interview about watching am
er -- people in the U.S. army  
playing baseball. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
89
 
 
 
 
 
A: Oh, baseball, yes. 
Q: And -- and I just wondered, you know, 
whether you found American culture in 
general to be a little bit similar to
 that, to just a lot of things th
at seem silly, or trivial, or -
- 

A: Oh well, since then I understand bels -- 
baseball, and I still found it extremely -- no 
logic to me. First time I saw them is I walk
ed out from eating, the -- I refused to eat the 
ki-kitchen -- the French  kitchen thing. So  I we
nt to a camp, I -- a-at that time I -- I told 
you, I took somebody™s shoes.
 So there was a cook cooking -- did I s -- about throwing 
the food to the dog? An
yway, the first time I see people pl
aying gloves with a ball, with a 
stick, and I found it extremely funny. I mean, lo
ok at these adults, if you -- I grew up in a 
culture of soccer. You play it for 90 minutes of
 play, at least there™s a sportsma n. Co ming 
to America, I found the same 
thing. The fellow gets millions 
of dollars paid, he has a -- a 
pinch hitter. He™s allowed three balls, or f
our balls, three mistakes, and they getting 
millions of dollars. And after mi
llions of dollars, they going 
on strike for -- for trillions. 
And we calling it sports. I mean, when do we 
gonna wake up and say,
 you know it™s not a 
sport at all, it™s a business. And we are pa
ying for this big -- and big business getting 
millions of dollars. And some 
of them behave off the fiel
d deplorably. So I -- I don™t 
watch baseball. Maybe sometime I just take a 
sneak if it™s the playoffs, but otherwise I 
don™t watch it [indecipherable]. So, I don™t 
want to be part of this big business 
conglomerate. And I still find it silly. The fello
w is the sport -- he™s a pinch hitter, he™s a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
90
 
 
 
 
 
pinch thrower. He gets four balls, I mean, not 
even the first one he throws, he is allowed 
to make three mistakes. And ho
ckey, I used to watch hockey, 
but it makes me violent. So 
the only one that sometime I sneak is at leas
t it™s one on one is -- 
is -- doesn™t appr -- 
doesn ™t approve my  philosophy, i-is boxing, once
 in awhile. And th is is not mu ch kinder 
sports than it is. But all rough,
 ro ugh. I™ve never been s-spor
ts. I™ve n-never been a sports 
follower. I belong to the Maccab
i, to the Zionist organization in Teplice, and I was a -- 
quite a good athlete there. Matter of fact, I 
was a good runner, and -- and -- and a climber, 
too. By  the way, I was a mountain climber in 
college. Did I ever tell the story about that? 
I was a mo untain climber, and I ch oose it. I 
was quite, quite good mountain climbing. On  
a Sunday we going mountain climbing, the th
ree of us, we go clim
bing, we did quite 
steep a cliff. I don™t know wh
at happened, I panicked. I ab solu tely panicked, and I was 
pass -- plat -- placed against the wall, and 
I hollered, ﬁMama, Mama.ﬂ You laughing? 
They  were laughing. They all thought this 
was a big joke. Who do you call, you call your 
mo ther. So I called, couldn™t call anything
 else. I called mama. They thought it was a 
joke, and they let me staying there, til, to th
is day, if I is -- my sister is on the 28
th
 floor. I 
cannot go on the balcony. My  
feet shake. If I see a movie, cli -- mountain climbing, my  
feet shake. Only because of this thing, 
because I hollered mama. And that™s true, I 
hollered mama. And this happened to me. 
Q: I wanted to ask you anothe
r kind of general question ab out -- in recent years in -- in 
the United States, there™s been 
more and more awareness in 
the public sphere about the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
91
 
 
 
 
 
Holocaust, and more and more 
films made, and books written, 
and -- and do you feel that 
that -- that -- how do you f
eel about that, in general? 
A: I am angry, and much against it. This
 became commercialized. The Italian film, the 
Holocaust, I would re-refuse to see it -- 
Q: ﬁLife is Beautiful?ﬂ 

A: -- because -- ﬁLife is Beautiful.ﬂ For si
mple reason. I only saw the preview. He 
marched with his leg raised behind the German army . This would never happen . I mean, 
this is a very, very serious subject. Don™t tr
ivialize it. He travel -- trivializing it. Same 
thing, the liar, whatever his name is, there™s a
nother picture, this picture they made about 
the liar. I d on™t -- the Holocaust is a serious
 subject. There™s six mi llion serious people 

died. So I™m -- I™m ag ainst it, don™t trivialize it.
 It™s -- an d let™s keep it seriously, and let™s 
give it the homage it™s deserves. But don™t make fun of it. 

Q: Do you respect any of the 
-- of the productions that have been made that treat the 
Holocaust in a fictional way? 
A: No, I -- I found Schindler™s List, which I 
found very moving, I found it very moving. 
And I do -- other picture I didn™t see -- I didn™t
 see them. I don™t see 
the Holocaust -- I -- I 
don™t -- I mer -- I don™t want to be hit over 
the head with  it again. It™s enough, it™s 
enough. Life has to go on. Yest
erday was yesterday. Do n™t forg
et it, preach it, talk about 
it, which I don™t know, I™m not very optimisti
c about it, but don™t -- don™t -- don™t -- don™t 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
92
 
 
 
 
 
-- I don™t want to see it. I don™t want to see it. 
It™s fi -- you™re talkin
g about 50 years. Two 
generations. Two generations.  
Q: I was wondering if you have any sense 
of an -- around wh en it was that you were 
deported from Lódz to Auschwitz. 

A: Yes. August -- August the third, 1944. I 
went b-back to ausch -- to -- to the Lódz 
ghetto in August the first or th e second, because Rain
ia told me thas my father was very 
sick. She knew wi -- she had 
the contact. I™m sure that I 
was not the only one who left 
from the Lódz ghetto. So I went 
back to see my  father, and 
he looked lousy, he looked 
very, very  bad, and -- and matter of fact, 
my mother said, ﬁHe 
looks better than you 
think,ﬂ because she put rouge on
 his cheek. And I brought back
 vials of glucose, because 
I [indecipherable] and I brought some bread,
 or two breads with me. Because, as a 
German, at least I had breads.
 And I think it was the day before, and after this they 
rounded up the s -- the whole st
reet there. It was Fronchy 
skunsky ooleetsa, 28, and I was 
one of them shi-shipped to -- 
to Auschwitz. And we got to se
e -- h ad the honor to see Mr.  
Mengele. 

Q: You™ve told us -- 

A: After two days -- not -- on a train, whatever it was.  
Q: Another question, from the time that you were
 in -- in Auschwitz, 
you told us -- told 
us about the German commander -- commandant, who was a-at your barrack in  
Auschwitz, and how he made you  his cook. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
93
 
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, knocked my  tooth out. Did I tell you? 
Q: And he knocked yo
ur tooth out, yeah. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah, di-did you know -- remember his name? 
A: No. He had a Po lish soundi
ng -- funny thing, he had a 
Polish sounding name, and the 
fellow I was looked in as a Nazi in  -- in th
e British zone, he had 
a Polish sounding name. 
No, but his -- I don™t know if I said it, his bi
ggest accomplishment in his life was thas he 
raped a 80 somewhat year old woman against th
e tree. H e was in love with the Gypsies. I 

got there Au gust the fourth, or 
the fifth. In July of the sa
me year, th ey -- they deported 
and killed all the Gypsies. He wa
s in love with a Gypsy lady, so
 he used to 
sleep with her 
dress on -- on, or next to him, he slept with
 her. The fellow who was 
helping me cook, I d 
-- I don™t know anything ab out cooking, and I 
don™t know -- less ab
out it now. But he 
liked it sour, so when I made 
him soup, that™s the only thi
ng we had, potatoes and water, 
whatever, vegetable soup, I used  to put a spo
onful of vinegar in it.
 And this vinegar, he 
thought this was the best soup I ever made, a
nd th e only thing is, because I put vinegar in 
it. Funny thing, I just spoke 
about it to somebody. The assist
ant was an -- a Jewi sh doctor 
from America, American doctor -- dermatol
ogist. He [indecipherable] was he left 
Germany, whatever it was, and went to Amer
ica, ca me t o  visit somebody, boom, they 
caught him, he went to Theresienstadt, from 
Theresienstadt he was in Au schwitz. His 
specialitz was warts. People he cured war -- pe
ople with warts, so -- I don™t know how 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
94
 
 
 
 
 
true it is, b u t what he told me
 is, when  people used to co me 
with it™s warts, he felt it was 
eradicated psychologically. So he used to give 
them a pill. He says, ﬁIf you take this pill, 
and if you urinate blue, the wart is helping.ﬂ 
So he gave them a placebo which didn™t do -
- no, the urine never turned to
 blue. So after one time, after second time, he came, no. 
Third time he gave th
em some kind of pill where the -- 
the urine turns blue. He says, 
ﬁOh, it™s helping.ﬂ After few treatments, the 
warts went away. So he was my a ssistant, 
that wasn™t much older than I was. And, as I 
said -- so this why -- I went to look, I had a 
girlfriend that time, an d I was looking for anybody. I knew it wasn™t my  brother, because 
he was a man. So I was looking fo r my  sister. So I volunteered between my  cooking, and 

getting bi -- hit on my  he -- on my behind, I jo
ined -- people used to take out the feces 
from -- from the -- fro m the toile
ts. You know, barracks they 
[indecipherable] but they  
had no sewer system, just went to
 the big pit, and later you ha
d to take it out with spoons, 
and put it in a big th ing, and later dump it, an
d they used it for fert
ilizing the vegetables. 
So I join ed one of those things
, so I went into the women™s 
camp, to look for my sister, 
and my  -- which I didn™t -- never expected, excu
se me -- never expected to see, and the -- 
and the same thing my  ex-g irlfriend. Never found anybody. 

Q: Were you ever given a numb er at Auschwitz? 
A: No, it -- by th at time this was overwhelmingly a lot of people came in. I know my  
number, 64641, but that™s -- 
that™s all what I knew. 
Q: 64641? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
95
 
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. And that™s all what I knew. And finally this semd -- I went to Ravensbrück, I 
went to -- to Bu chen wald. Buch enwald  I me
t Mrs. Rothchild. Did I tell you this story? 
Q: Yeah, that -- you mentioned her. 
A: And I met -- met th e prime minister of Aust
ria -- ex-prime minister of Austria, I met 
him there. And this was the first time I got 
a bath, actually, I took
 a bath. By then I 
befriended Monyek Ravel,
 and we took a water fountain, we took a first bath there. 
Q: Did you ever visit Israel? 
A: Sure, yes. Never went to 
Yad Vashem. I went to the -- I 
walked down to the Avenue 
of the Righteous, do everything, but I cann
ot walk into Yad Vash em. Can™t make it. 
Q: Do you have a strong fee
ling about the importance of th
ere being a Jewish state? 
A: Yes. Except that being destroyed within  se
lf. They™re destroyed within self. I think the 
problem is this, the parliamentary system doe
sn™t work as well as a Republican system 
what we have here. Because 
coming of -- with getting a co
alition, and -- and you don™t 
vote for a man, you vote for a party. The party 
puts out candidate x,y,
z, and if this party 
wins, x,y,z gets into the office. So the part
y is the one who picks 
the office, regardless 
what qualicatio -- what qualification you thin
k he has, is inconseq
uential, because the 
party feels, so long it™s -- does a good fo
r the party. Where we here, we have a 
parliamentary s -- a -- a Republican system, 
we p -- we pick the man. S -- Ben-Gurion 
was actually -- the Ben-Gu rion wanted this
 system, exce pt Chaim Weissman was a 

Anglophile, he love angla -- Engl
and. So we have this system
. Same thing, otherw ise he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
96
 
 
 
 
 
would -- Ben-Gurion wanted the -- we sh -- 
bi -- they should sp eak Hebrew, Weissman 
wanted th ey  should speak English. 
Q: Were the event -- the semina
l events in Israeli history 
important to you? The -- did 
you -- wh en the six day war was happening, were you -- 

A: Oh, I study -- I studied history, so I still 
do -- I still do now. I s
till study Israel history 
[indecipherable] everybody™s di
fferent view. I just fitting -- aba -- yo -- I just fin ished 

Chaim -- Chaim be -- gur -- Ben-Gurion™s histor
y of the Jews, and I just finished Eba 
Evens, which is more cultura
lly, more intellectually, and more in detailed written the 
history of the Jews. I mean, the suffering is -- is through milleniums. It™s amazing they 

survived so long. It™s a mazing. It™ s the only 
thing, in my philosophy 
it™s because they did 
not let them assimilate. Now -- now is the dest
ruction of Judaism. Why? Because they let 
us assimilate. They going [indecipherable] let 
-- we can approach any culture we want to, 
and we have the finest example, 51 percent 
of our Jewish marriages are intermarriages. 
51 percent. And a big percentage is, if the boy
 marries a Christian girl, the family stays 
Christian. If the j-jew -- the girl is Jewish
, there™s a par -- bigg
er possibility that the 
family stay s Jewish. So it™s 
only because through assimilati
on. Years ago, the -- we had 
to stay Jewish, because 
they put us in ghettos, they put us in towns, and they
 didn™t let us 
assimilate. We have famous, famous people to
 change their religion because they thought 
they going to assimilate, but it™s not true. 

Q: Does it -- are you thin -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
97
 
 
 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] Marler, one of the famous , fine musician, became a Christian because 
he -- it didn™t help, by th e way. He became
 the [indecipherable] of -- of New Yo rk 
filomec, but they still call him the Jew. Ka
rl Marx. We have a lot of famous Jews. 
[indecipherable] Heinich Hiner. He said -- Hein
ich Hiner said he doesn™t want a ca -- he 
doesn ™t want to be a Jew because he carried 
the world™s pain in hi
s soul. So there™s the 
reason he didn™t want to be. 

Q: Does it upset you, that assimilation? 
A: Not at all. Not at all. It™s only a -- a -- ups
et me in one point, it™s this -- it™s the nuclear 
of this -- little nuclear of Judaism going to  di
sappear. And as I said, Judaism is -- is the 
soul of the people, I mean, as I said. But he
n -- Heini Hiner said, he says, ﬁJudaism carry 
the soul.ﬂ And that™s what it is. And now 
we have interfight, we have fight. I mean, 
minute we got out of the ghetto
, you have also -- look how 
many different rel -- Judaism 
we have, five of them, I think. Conservativ
e, Orthodox, and [indecipherable] Orthodox, 
700 different million -- different
 groups. And the same thing is -- i-it™s -- the va -- 
Judaism is not exclusive. Martin Luther 
King kri -- killed Christianity. Look how many 
different Ch ristian denomination, before we 
had only one. So, we spreading it, and in  -- 
in generations, going to  disappear. Maybe 
not in hundred years, 200 years, but it 
eventually has to. 

Q: Did you mean Martin Luth
er, or Martin Luther King? 
A: Martin Luther. I said
 Martin Luther King? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
98
 
 
 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: No, Martin Luther. 

Q: Okay . 
A: No, Martin Luther, Martin Lu
ther. That™s who I meant, yes. 
Q: Let™s see. Did you -- do you rememb er the -- 
I -- just a couple of minor things. Does y 
-- do you rememb er the name of the camp  wh ere you went after you were in Lud-

Ludwig™s -- 
A: I was [indecipherab
le] Ludwig™s loost. 
Q: Loost. 
A: I got freed. This was a camp -- I was on a tr
ansport to go to  Sw eden, I don™t know if I 
said it, did I [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Seemed like it™s fell thro
ugh with this, I think it had to do something fo r Eichmann, 
because it had to do an
 exchange of trucks, and a p -- 
and a -- a Swiss passport for -- for 
him, or for whatever it is. So this was a 
camp , they practiced cannibalism. This was a 
camp -- I mean, laying -- we laid on -- on wet sand. 

Q: This is -- I™m sorry, go ahead. 
A: This was on wet sand we laid. A camp before
 this, we s -- as I said, we had to go -- 
board  a transport to go to Sw eden . So  si
nce I spoke German, and -- so I became the 
fellow wh o gave out Red Cross packages. Ex
cept if we -- it were, 
I think two or 300 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
99
 
 
 
 
 
people. Before we gave them 
the packages, I had to go in
to the German barracks, and 
open every package and take out the chocolate 
for the Germans, and give out the packag e 
without it. So I fi -- I™ve give them the chus 
-- chus -- so I had so me chocolates also in my 
pocket, and so Monyek Ravel and I, we shar
ed the chocolates. So had some in the 
pockets, but [indecipherable] 
ran out, so when we travel
ed from the last camp to 
Ludwig™s loost, we had no water, we -- o-op
en cattle cars. So it™s --was ho -- very, very 
dry, no water.  
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
A: -- and literally cannibals, they were
 eating whatever flesh was there the 
[indecipherable] because ther
e was no food, was no food. The war was going to end, and 
we were starving, for starving. So the other si
de of the camp, there was a -- a fence, and a 
-- a -- metal f -- not a metal fence, a wit -- ba
rbed wires fence, and the other side was a 
sugar mill. Not from -- sugar mill 
made out of beets, not of sugar cane, beets. Now, let 
me emphasize, the German didn™t know what 
was going on, so if the fa -- if the factory 
worker worked in the sugar 
mill, he saw the camp is bei
ng built, and they saw wh-what 
was going on. Anyway s, I -- I tied up my  pa
nts on th e bottom, both my  -- my  legs, by my  

ankle, and I smuggled my self out. Did I tell you 
th is story? And I beat -- I -- I robbed  a 
[indecipherable] of -- of it™s sugar beets. Wh
ich was, by the way, a disservice. I saved 
their life, o r dis -- didn™t save their life, 
because they were eating the sugar beet -- not 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
100
 
 
 
 
 
only they , Bernard, too, and Monyek Rave
l. Whatever, the group was eating it too. 
Except some of them, the expa
nsion of the stomach of the 
sugar beets, killed them. The 
intentions were good, the patient died. I d
on™t know how many, or 
whatever this, but it 
was terrible, terrible cramps. Terrible, terribl
e cramps. Diarrhea, it was just running up, 
and we had to lay in it, and we had to sleep
 in it. And we [indecipherable] the wet sand, 
because we had no -- no 
roof, no roof, nothing. 
Q: Did you have anything else
 to eat while you were there? 
A: I™m here, so I must had something eat,
 but seemed lik e it didn™t leave ana -- much 
impression, because I -- we ate at the shka -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I risked
 my life. W asn™t as 
much as a risk for anybody el
se, but no altruistic, it was as 
-- as selfish as it could been 
also, because I wanted to eat, too. But I saw th
e heaps of -- of beets there. So that™s what I 
stole.  
Q: Okay . 

A: And the beating was the wo
rst beating was the day I wasliberated. Day was -- o -- this 
was it, but it™s mo st biggest prob-problem wa s the fellow with the shu -- with the water 

pill. Couldn™t forget it. And right after the 
war, I mean, going back, allegedly to Poland, 
is a -- the -- the -- the 
transport, because I found out from 
Poland it™s going to be easier to 
go to  Teplice. I s -- those -- hearing those wo me
n being raped, I shall never forget it. And 

this left me immediately a te
rrible feeling vis à vis the Russians. Terrible feeling with th e 
-- with the Russians. Cause I feel, if -- if 
-- if they™re being raped, and it™s happening,

where was at least one decent soul? Thos
e women, I mean, they were not -- not 
Holocaust survivors, they were
 forced laborers. I mean, they
 were not concentration ca -- 
not Jewish girls, they Polish fo rced laborers.
 What a -- what -- regardless what they was, 
it -- the husband staying outside, and they 
hear this cries, a
nd this thing, they 
[indecipherable]. Where was one -- one upriding 
 Russian citizen, or 
something, that™s -- 
you know, it™s, ﬁWhat the hell 
are you doing here?ﬂ Noth ing. 
So  wh en the Russian gave 
me the [indecipherable] maybe this was psychol
ogical, I always felt that might as well 
leave. Anyway, I went back 
to Teplice now in March, y
ou can see -- you can see the 
remnants of Ru-Russians cultu
re there™s a -- you know, they
 didn™t let m -- develop. 
Finally, now, they -- they developing independe
nce, and they don™tknow how to handle 
it yet.  
Q: Is there anything else that you want to
 say, that I have overlooked  asking you? 
A: I can™t think of anything else. I can™t thin
k it was -- y ou were very kind to me. That™s -
- you didn™t make me suffer too mu  -- too much
. But I feel I exposed  my  soul, which I™m 
usually a private person, I don™t do it too well , and I don™t like to do it. So, it was a little 

rough. 

Q: I think you did a -- I 
think you did a very , ve
ry good job, and I -- 
A: Thank you very much. 

Q: -- I thank you very mu
ch. Okay, we™re -- we™re going to l

A: This is a kaleidoscope. If you notice this, 
the frame is in, and th
ere™s an eye looking 
out, and you have hundreds an
d hundreds of different colo
rs in a kaleidoscope. Second 
picture is, ﬁChaos.ﬂ This is
 called ﬁChaos,ﬂ because ther
e is no rhyme or reaso n , but 
there™s a lot of colors in it. The next -- 
Q: It looks like a Jack
son Pollack painting. 
A: It just looks like Jackson Po llack is right
, and I did it through dr
ipping method. Next 
one is called, ﬁThe Red Mo on.ﬂ  
Q: ﬁRed Moon,ﬂ th
at™s -- that™s -- 
A: Molieriani. [indecipherable
] from Molieriani. This one he
re is -- is a collage, it™s 
called, ﬁLost,ﬂ it™s a map. So
 I -- my  childre -- ﬁLost,ﬂ is a stop sign, and speed sign, and 
my children™s name on it, and it™s towns wher
e they come from, a
nd the town where I 
came from. 
Q: An-A nd how do you -- what -- do you sit do
wn  and come up with 
the i -- these ideas, 
or do they just come to
 you, or how do you -- 
A: No, no, no, I -- I -- It™s -- I™ve -- I™ve -- if
 I have no idea, I don™t do it. I start to do 
something, I have a canvas, and -- blank canvas
, I started  to do ch -- to do with a pencil 

marking, but I put it away, it™s just -- I did it  mechanically. It wasn™t emotion, I did it 
mechanical, so I gave it up. I don™t know what
 I gonna do. Next is a pin -- a pain ting, a 
big one, by Mo-Morris Katz -- Ma
nny Katz -- Morris Katz -- Mo
rris Katz. It™s a scene of 
a -- of a ti -- some kind of pastoral shi -- scen
e. Next one, the corner
, is Ross. Ross is the

painter if you -- on television as an artist, he
 p -- just passed on ri -- recently. Has a big, 
bushy hair, his name is Ross, 
who teaches you how to paint.
 That™s him. That™s Ross. 
This next painting is here, it™
s called, ﬁThe Black Hole.ﬂ 
Q: And this is one of your paintings? 
A: My painting. This called, ﬁThe Black Ho le.ﬂ  

Q: D-Do they -- when you -- so you come up 
with the idea of doing this painting, ﬁThe 

Black Hole.ﬂ 
A: Sure, yes. 
Q: D -- i -- it -- does it symbolize some
thing for you, or is it just -- 
A: I-It symbol -- ﬁThe Black Hole,ﬂ symboliz
es how small we are. H o w s -- ab-absolute 
small we are in -- in -- in -- 
according what be tr -- do no
w, we know, whatev er this 
whole universe, whatever we here, can be supp
ressed, or depressed so small, thas it can 
fit on a tablespoon. One little tablespoon, 
and this fits into the Black Hole. 
Q: Okay, so maybe just to 
describe what™s around it. 
A: It -- it -- no, I™m not di -- whatever I feel
 about it is because i -- I™m a [indecipherable] 
with a certain creations. So there had to be
 a -- even an agnostic. Thank God I™m not 
agnostic. Sounds so ludicrous, which this how 
it is. But I feel there was a beginning, and 
if there was a be-beginning, what
 created it? And that™s what 
I™m not sure with that. This 
one here is -- I usually write what it is [i
ndecipherable] called ﬁT
he Big Bang.ﬂ Here™s 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
104
 
 
 
 
 
ﬁThe Big Bang.ﬂ This I [indecipherable] is a 
creation, the universe c -- was created in one 
split, multi-second. And this is a big bang. 

Q: Now, I™m just going to describe it so we -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- get some idea of
 what it looks like. 

A: Yes. 

Q: It™s just m -- a lot of different colors
, maybe 20 or 30, and 
-- and dripped, and -- 
A: Emanates from the center. 

Q: -- yeah, em-emanating from the center. 
Kind of -- we -- and the -- and ﬁT he Black 
Hole,ﬂ one is, the black hole is kind of surro
unded by -- by a big explosion of co lors, as 
well. I-Is color important to you?  

A: Yes, yes, I love colors. 

Q: I mean, walking 
into your house -- 
A: I love colors. I love colors, 
I -- colors is life. Color is life. I love colors, and I love 
music. I never walk in this house without what I™ve called no
ise. I always have to have 
mu sic, classical, I™m strictly
 classical. I don™t walk in, I 
don™t get up in the mo rning 
without noise, I don™t go to  sleep
 without noise. I mean, if yo
u shut off the tape, there™s -- 
always have the noise, I have speakers 
all over the house. And I love noise. 
Q: Okay, moving on to --

105
 
 
 
 
 
A: There™s a -- a statue which I -- this is one
 which I did myself. It™s called a -- ﬁThe 
Tower of Babel,ﬂ which is
 wood and papier maché. 

Q: And -- and the -- the little colored ba
lls that are surrounding the tower -- 
A: Is different languages. 

Q: -- represent different languages. 

A: That™s wa -- different languages. 
The table here, the -- I designed it.  
Q: Oh. 
A: I design furniture too, by the way. Yes, as
 a hobby I enjoy. And 
[inaudible] thing is -- 
this is by -- I got it from the Vincent Price co llection, there™s an Italian painter. It™s a 
scene, children playing against the wall. 
Q: That looks kind of surreal, almost. 
A: Yes, yes, this looks surreal. 

Q: Children in -- in this big, gray space, with graffiti against the wall. 

A: Next one is by a man by the name of 
Calhoun, who praints -- 
who teaches prisoners 
how to paint, and he does pr
ison scenes. This is quite a bi
g painting of a 
black man sitting 
on a chair. 

Q: And you mentioned a little earl
ier that you -- you go to thri
ft stores to buy a lot of 
these. 

A: I go -- some of them -- some of them, no
t lot of them. Not lot of -- you can™t find 
them. This is a painting by Fromault.  I don™t 
like water scenes, so th
is is a little bit of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
106
 
 
 
 
 
water. This is Fromault. His wife is a mu
ch more pronoun -- mu
ch more recognized 
painter. This I got [inaudible] yes, yes. 
Q: The scene with a -- a vase, and a view out behind it. That™s a nice one. 
A: Yeah. This is more -- Mo
rris Katz, two more for Morris 
Katz, which is written up in 
the ﬁGuinness Book of ret -- Record,ﬂ as a mo
st prolific painter. He did, I think -- every 
three minutes, he makes a painting. [inaudible] 
Q: You don™t have to -- I mean, if you want
 to sho -- talk about every painting in the 
house, that™s fine, but -- but we could just fo
cu s on your paint -- your paintings, if you -- 
A: Oh [indecipherable] my  pa
intings [inaudible]. In my  bedroom, there™s a -- there™s a 
painting, my  painting, is a -- a scene of wind
ow being opened  towards the ocean, with a 
vase on the windowsill, and the petals are fa
lling off. There™s the one which I did here. 
Q: And does this one have a symbolism for you? 
A: No, nothing at all, nothing. Just to prov
e my self I can do [indecipherable] paintings, 
too. That™s what it is. Now here, is nothing.
 Let™s go over here to the den, there™s a 
painting. I did four paintings 
symbolizing the Holocaust. One of them is a blackboard, 

which markings of 28 lines, five, five, five
, five and three. It™s a crooked pain ting, 
hanging on an old piece of wood
, with a h -- with a nail hook
, which is dripping with 
blood. 

Q: And -- and why is 
the painting crooked? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
107
 
 
 
 
 
A: It crooked because I feel psychologically
 the preciseness of Germany was not always 
precise. Sometime it has been crooked. And 
th is one time, they were crooked. Next 
painting is a Holocaust scene of
 twent -- with a big 28 in it,
 which is 28 memb ers which I 
lost. On --on the bottom you can see the shower, with the gas. You can see the fence, you 
can see the chimney, which is spewing ashes,
 and blood. The 28 ne 
-- members, 28 faces, 
27 mouths, because my mother 
and father spoke with one m
outh, and the picture of my 
brother, the b -- eyes are blank, because he 
didn™t see the world yet. Underneath him is a 
sculpture wh ich I call, ﬁThe last Kaddish,ﬂ the 
last prayer for the death, which consists of 
stone sculpture, and tw o tears, with a -- with a 
Star of David, a gold star of David inside, 
with six different candles, which each repres
ent a different denomination. One is blue, 
it™s a Jewess, one is pink fo r the homo sexual, 
one is red for the Communist, one is for the 
Gypsies, and so on. And in the middle of it 
there is a -- a -- a candle d -- a candle glass, 
which is broken, which the wick 
is lit out -- is -- is -- is runn
ed down to the end. And the 
stones are full of smoke. Next to him have 
a painting, it™s still the 28, which is cr -- 
crossed out, which has 28 differe
nt colors. Each member of
 my family had one color. 
Above it, there is finally a little
 more optimistic painting, whic
h is called, ﬁSunrise.ﬂ It™s 
an abstract, with a yellow sun, and black lines 
over it. I think this finishes my paintings.  
Q: Thank you. What 
about this -- this -- 
A: This is a collage -- collage of -- of phot
ographs, wh ich I took some, and some of them 
I acquired, and plus with my  
food stamp, which has came fro
m the Lódz ghetto, and plus 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
108
 
 
 
 
 
I™ve pak -- pictures of the Jews which came 
back after the war, and were killed, which -- 
which I gave to the Holocaust Museum. 
Q: How did you find those pictures? 
A: Some of them I took, some of them I -- 
I tried to -- whoever gave me the pictures, I 
tried to get them. I think the mo st disturbing pi
ctures is that fun -- is this one here, with 
me. This fellow here, this most disturbing pi
cture for me, because see, if y -- if you can 
look at it, he™s being ex -executed, and notice 
-- look at his face, he says why me? Isn™t it -

- this is most ex -- terrible picture. 
Q: It™s a -- a line-up of six men standing ag
ainst a building, and -- and th e caption says, 
ﬁExecu tion, Warsaw ghetto, 1942.ﬂ And th e man 
who Mr. Helmer is pointing out is -- is 
im -- pointing to  -- has his hands over his ches
t, and -- and lo oks as if he™s crying out. 
A: Why me? Here™s -- here [inde
cipherable] try to esca --  see this, finally escape through 
the underground, so they  shoot him. Polish underground sh
oot him. Finally they escaped. 
So that™s what it was, so -- so when I wa
s in the CIC, we did not trust the Polish 
underground, because it seems like they
 knew what was 
going on there. 
Q: And -- and right belo w all of these -- all of 
these pictures, there are  pictures of your 
grandchildren. 

A: Of my grandchildren [inaudible]. It is a 
-- which I told you about
 it, the -- th e lists -- 
what is this here? This is a list which I told
 you, they gave it for th
e Riga ghetto in -- in 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064
 
 
109
 
 
 
 
 
November the 20
th
, 1941. This all the people who were
 sent to the gas chamber in the 
Riga -- Riga ghetto. 
Q: There anything else you could -- 
A: No, I think it was -- that™s it. I™m very hap
py. That™s right. Finally I made it. I finally 
found peace and happiness, which 
is absolutely wonderful. Yes. 
Q: That is wonderful. Thank you. 

A: Thank you.
