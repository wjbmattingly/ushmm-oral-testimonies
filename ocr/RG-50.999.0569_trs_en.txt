Henry Kahn was  born Heinz Kahn on J anuar y 18, 1923 in Boblingen, Germany.
 
              
This p
hoto s hows  Henr y in 1946 prior to his  induction in the United States
 
    
Army.

The arr ow on this  m ap points to the town of Boblingen wher e Henry was  bor n.
 
              
Her e we s ee Henr y's  m other Hedwig and His  father Adolf, who was  a c attle
 
    
dealer and fought for Germ any in World War I.
 
              
Later, Henr y's  father bec am e pres ident of a c attle dealers' as s ociation.
 
              
On November  9
-
10, 1938, the Nazis  unleas hed a violent s er ies of attack s  on
 
    
Jewish- o
wned bus ines s es  and s ynagogues throughout Germany known as Kr is tallnac ht, or
 
    
the "Night of Broken Glas s ."  Henr y's father was  arres ted and s ent to Dachau
 
    
c onc
entration cam p.
 
              
This photogr aph s hows  Germ ans pas s ing the broken window of a J ewis h
-
owned
 
    
bus ines s that was  destroyed during Kris tallnacht. Henry's  father  r eturned hom e a m onth
 
    
later.  Shortly after this,
 
Henry left Germ any through a Kindertrans por t, a r es c ue effort
 
    
that brought thous ands  of J ewis h c hildren to Great Br itain from  Nazi Ger many between
 
    
1938 and 1939.  Henry ar rived in England in Februar y 1939.
 
              
WhenWorld War  II began Septem ber  1, 1939, Br itis h author
ities  required Henr y
 
    
to regis ter  as an "enem y alien."
 
              
He was  s ent by s hip to Australia which is  highlighted in r ed on this m ap of
 
    
the world. After jus t one night in an internment c amp there, Henr y and 12 other men were
 
    
s elected to
 
r eturn to England, only to end up in Bombay, India.
 
              
The arr ow on this  m ap points to India.
 
              
In 1946 Henry moved to the United States .
 
              
After  the war, Henry lear ned Nazi authorities  had deported his  par ents to the
 
    
Lodz ghetto in 1941.
 
              
They were later  murdered.
 
              
We c los e with this  photograph of Henr y and Dor een Raym ond on their wedding day
 
    
in 1948.
 
              
He m et Dor een in Bombay in 1943.
 
              
J us t a few m onths  after Henr y's  ar rival in New York  in 1946 he was  Dr afted
 
    
into the United States  Arm y.
 
              
With the end of the draft he was  honorably dis c har ged in the s pring of 1947.
 
    
Henr y's s weethear t from Bombay, Doreen Raymond, arrived in the U.S. on J une 9, 1948.
 
    
They were mar ried 18 days  later on J une 27, 1948.
 
              
After  working in the expor t
-
import bus ines s , Henry went into the sc r ap m etal
 
    
bus ines s.  While working full
-
tim e and r ais ing a fam ily he enr olled in Baruc h College at
 
    
the City Univers ity of New York as an evening s tudent in 1956 earning his  degr ee in
 
    
Industrial Management in 1966.
 
              
Dor een attended Queens College getting a degree as a par alegal and worked as  a
 
    
par alegal in the Empire State Building.
 
              
Henr y r emained in the s cr ap metal bus ines s  until his 65th bir thday in 1988.
 
              
He then bec ame a real es tate agent. Following a diagnos is  of lung c anc er in
 
    
1992 Henr y retir ed fr om  his real estate wor k .
 
              
Henry and Dor een rais ed two s ons , Ralph Ans el and Roy David, and gave them  two
 
    
gr ands ons and a gr anddaughter.
 
              
To be c los er to their fam ily Henr y and Dor een m oved from New York to Bethes da,
 
    
Maryland, in 2000.
 
              
Dor een pass ed away in Novem ber
 
2012. Henr y s aid to m e, "We were very m uch in
 
    
love r ight up to the end."
 
              
Henry c ontinues to volunteer  at the Montgom ery County Thr ift Shop where Dor een
 
    
and he c ontr ibuted their  time together .
 
              
Following the los s of Doreen, Henr y became involved with this  mus eum  as  a
 
    
volunteer.  Henry s peaks to sm all groups at the m us eum.  He als o s peaks about his
 
    
Holoc aus t experienc e at loc al high sc hools  and c olleges.

Henr y i
s  fluent in Englis h and Germ an and walks  regular ly and said he is  now
 
    
inc r eas ing his  exerc ise.  He reads  a lot and s pends  time with fam ily and friends, and
 
    
I'm pleas ed to s ay that Henr y today is  joined by both s ons, Ralph and Roy and their
 
    
wive

--
 
gr ands on Sas ha and
 
    
gr anddaughter Alena are with us .  I believe Sas ha jus t graduated fr om  high sc hool this
 
    
past week.  I would like to ask you to welc om e our Fir st Per s on, Mr . Henr y Kahn.
 
              
[Applaus e]
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, thank you s o m uc h for joining us  and your  willingnes s
 
    
to be our First Pers on today. We're really honor ed to have you with us  today.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Thank  you ver y m uc h.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, befor e we begin our c onver s ation today, you as ked that
 
    
we s tar t by noting to our audience that ther e are a broad range of ways  that people
 
    
s ur vive the Holoc aus t depending on the tim e, plac e and c irc umstanc es that they wer e
 
    
living under.  Som e s ur vived c onc entration c amps .  For exam ple, you s har ed with m e that
 
    
your friend, J ean 
--
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  I c an't hear.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Is that better ?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah.
 
              
>> Bill Bens on:  Okay, you s hared with m e that your  fr iend, J ean, s ur vived
 
    
Aus c hwitz, but J ean's eight fam ily m em ber s  did not.  Ther e ar e other s who s urvived in
 
    
hiding, and then others  like you who were res c ued and found s afety in c ountr ies not
 
    
oc c upied by the Nazi regime, and that's  a way to rem ind us that your acc ount of what you
 

    
exper ienced is one indiv idual ac c ount, and befor e we c ontinue, I know you c an't s ee
 
    
this , but Henr y br ought this  with us  to put up fr ont, and it s ays  "No wic ked pers on will
 
    
s ucc eed if the good people don't ac c ede."
 
              
We will r em ind our s elves  with that r ight there.
 
              
Henry, you have s o m uc h to tell us.  We have a little time, s o we'r e going to
 
    
start.
 
              
You were ten year s  old when Hitler and the Nazis  c am e to power  in 1933.
 
    
Before we tur n to the war  and the Holoc aust and the ear lies t years  of the Hitler  regim e,
 
    
tell us  about your  fam ily and you in the year s befor e 1933.
 
             
 
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, we lived in a s m all town, whic h in the m eantime bec am e a
 
    
s uburb of Stuttgart, but at the time it was  a town, an independent town, and my father
 
    
had to tr avel ever y mor ning by train to get to work.  On the 18th of J anuary, 1923, when
 
    
I was  born, m y m other was  in the hospital and next to her or  c los e to her was  another
 
    
lady who had a daughter.  She was  Mr s . Kins ler and s he and m y wife and m other bec am e
 
    
good fr iends  as did their  r es pected families .
 
              
He wa
s  the owner of a toy fac tory, whic h was  benefit to m ys elf and m y brother.
 
              
My br other, unfortunately, pas s ed away in 1932 at s even year s  of age, but we
 
    
were very good friends  and m y par ents  went skiing with them  and played tennis  and m y
 
   
father and him, they met on Sunday m ornings at a gues t hous e and they wer e good friends .
 
    
After the Nazis  had c om e, he didn't want to join the Nazi par ty, but my father s ugges ted
 
    
to them that it might be a good idea that he s hould join, bec aus e it
 
would be an outc ast
 
    
if you didn't.  Talk about outc asts , Hitler did his  bes t to eventually des troy the J ews .
 
    
My father was  of the opinion that he had been in the fir st world war  and earned the Eye
 
    
of the Cr os s , and a veter an, obvious ly, and nothing could happen to him.  However , after
 
    
the 9th of Novem ber , Kr is tallnac ht, he was  arres ted and s ent to the c onc entration c amp.
 
    
And when he c ame bac k , ver y haggar d and no hair, all s haved off, he told me and my
 
    
m other , if ever I get bac k  ther e, I'll never  c om e out alive.  By then he had c hanged his
 
    
opinion, and unfortunately it was  too late.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, befor e we c ontinue about Kr is tallnac ht, let me ask
 

4 
 
    
another ques tion.  I think  when you were about s even, 1930, your fam ily moved to
 
    
Stuttgart s o you c ould attend the or iginal Waldorf Sc hool.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  I was  getting to that.  When I was  s even year s  old, my father,
 
    
who had to 
c ommute ever y m or ning, after he had been elected pr es ident of the
 
    
as s oc iation, he 
--
 
we dec ided 
--
 
or the parents dec ided to m ove to Stuttgart, and we
 
    
m oved ver y c los e to the Waldorf Sc hool.  The Waldorf Sc hool was  a unique sc hool, and the
 
    
owne
r of a factor y whic h was  c alled Waldorf As toria factory, he reques ted a philos opher
 
    
fr om  Austr ia, Rudolph Steiner  to guide the s c hool, and his philos ophy was  very modern,
 
    
m odern even today.  In the m eantime, the sc hool was  founded.  They were very unique, and
 
    
in the m eantim e, the sc hools  exis t all over  the wor ld, inc luding over  here.
 
              
So I went to the Waldorf Sc hool.  His  philos ophy, of c our s e, did not agree
 
    
with the Nazis  or  r ather the Nazis  didn't agr ee with the Waldorf School
 
philos ophy, and
 
    
c ons equently, 1938, the s c hool was  c los ed and the teac her s were dis mis s ed and they had
 
    
to look  for jobs .
 
              
I had a c las s  teac her who was  teac hing the c las s from the fir s t to the fifth
 
    
gr ade.  I was  ther e until the four th gr ade when we moved to Cologne.
 
              
Well, as I mentioned, in 1938, after the Kris tallnac ht, we r ec eived a telegr am
 
    
fr om  m y c ous in in England, who was  wor king in the factory, and he was  friendly with a
 
    
gir l whos e father  was  the owner , part owner of a c lothing fac tory.  And he persuaded
 
    
them to s pons or  me, becaus e kids  who cam e to England thr ough the Kindertrans port, they
 
    
had to be r es pons ible for s omebody.  That is how I was  for tunate to get to England on
 
    
the Kindertrans po
r t.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we talk about the Kindertr ans port, c an I as k  you a
 
    
c ouple m ore questions  before we get ther e?  Shortly after Hitler c am e to power in 1933,
 
    
I think your father  lost his  bus ines s .  Tell us about his  los ing his bus iness  and how he
 
    
m ade ends  m eet for his  fam ily.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, unfor tunately, it was  ver y s imple.  After '33, after
 
    
Hitler c ame to power, my father  was  the pr es ident, pr etty large, and, of c our s e, there
 
    
were Nazis  amongst the mem bers , and one day one of the Nazis  in his  unifor m c am e into
 
    
the offic e and told my father  he s hould get out, he had no r ight to be there anymore.
 
    
My father threw the keys  on the floor and walked out and that was  it.
 
             
So there was  no argument.  He c ouldn't call
 
the polic e or anything like
 
    
this , bec aus e the Nazis  wer e in power.  And they had a lot of power, becaus e he c ouldn't
 
    
argue with them.  The polic e, they c ouldn't do anything either .  Anyway, getting back
 
    
to 
--
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  One mor e ques tion.  Befor e 1938, did your family  c ons ider
 
    
emigrating?  Did they think about leaving Ger many?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Unfortunately, m y m other  c ertainly did.  She did all s or ts of
 
    
things to pr epar e for  emigr ation, however , my father, he was  s o c onvinc ed that nothing
 
    
c ould happen to him, and he didn't c hange his  m ind until he c ame back  fr om the
 
    
c onc entration c am p.  So c ons equently, and at that tim e, we didn't have as  m uch power  
--
 
    
women didn't have as m uc h power  as they have thes e days , and c ons equently, that was
 
    
questioned.  So they m oved to Cologne, wher e m y father took over  a plywood dealers hip,
 
    
and he worked ther e and there was  
--
 
I don't know how s ucc es sful, uns uc ces sful at most,
 
    
but he was  wor king ther e until 1938.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  As  you told us  alr eady, your  father was  arr ested as  part of
 
    
Kr istallnac ht.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  I s aid, yes , I told you, when he c am e out fr om th
e 
    
c onc entration c am p, he had c hanged his  m ind, but then it was  too late.  But 18 days
 
    
after my 16th birthday I 
--
 
m y parents and I went to the railroad station and they s aid
 
    
goodbye to m e, bec aus e I was  s uppos ed to go on the Kindertrans port to 
England.  I got
 

5 
 
    
into the c ar , and I knew I was  going to s ee them again.  I m ean, I just k new it.  I
 
    
c an't tell you how, but, however , the tr ain was  delayed by half an hour .  My parents ,
 
    
who had left the platfor m found out about it and c ame back
.  The mom ent I s aw them
 
    
c oming back, I knew this  is  the las t tim e I s ee them, and the last tim e I talk to them .
 
    
And this  is exac tly how it worked out.  You c an't imagine m y c ondition when I notic ed
 
    
that.  It was  a feeling.  I c an't explain it to you, but this  is  the way it was .
 
              
Well, when we c ros s ed the bor der 
--
 
after we had c ros s ed the border  into
 
    
Holland, the train left, and after we c ros s ed the bor der  into Holland, a girl 
--
 
I was
 
    
one of the oldes t ones, bec aus e the age lim it for the Kindertr ans por t was  fr om 3 to 17.
 
    
I was  16, s o I just m ade it.
 
              
After  we had cros s ed the border and ever ybody was  s ur e that the Nazis  weren't
 
    
ther e anymore, a little girl
 
took  a news paper with Hitler 's pic ture on it and tor e it
 
    
into a thous and piec es.  So this  gives  you the atmos phere. We had left that.
 
              
When we finally  got to England, the ferry took  us ac r os s the c hannel, and we
 
    
got in, and sinc e I had learned a little Englis h 
--
 
exc us e me 
-- -
in the Waldorf Sc hool
 
    
we lear ned Englis h and heard Englis h 
--
 
Englis h and Fr enc h from the firs t gr ade on, and
 
    
boys  and girls  were 
--
 
getting back  to that, girls  and boys  were in the s am e c las s, and
 
    
in
 
the third grade ever ybody had s om e 
--
 
we learned how to s ew in the fir s t grade and
 
    
gir ls were able to go into a wor ks hop and you lear n how to us e tools , just to give you
 
    
an idea about theWaldorf Sc hool.  So now we wer e in England, and we were in a big hall,
 
    
and people walked in and looked for c hildr en who had been as s igned to them , and I k new a
 
    
little bit of Englis h, s o a nic e lady walked in in a nic e fur c oat and I figur ed I'd s ee
 
    
if I c ould help her , and I asked if I c ould help her, and she pulled out a paper  with
 
    
Heinz Kahn.  So I had m y s pons or.  Her name was  Mrs . London, and my cous in c am e and we
 
    
dr ove to their home, whic h was  in Hamps tead Gar den s ubur b, a nic e hom e.  For a very
 
    
s hort tim e, Mr. London asked m e if I would like to go to s chool or if I would like to
 
    
work. Well, I had in mind to get to United States , and I knew going to s chool wouldn't
 
    
teac h me very muc h to make a living, s o I dec ided I wanted to get a job and lear n how
 
    
to 
--
 
and onc e more, I ha
d no money anyway.  So I dec ided I wanted to go to work , to
 
    
learn s om ething s o I could ear n a living when I get to the States to s ave up s om e money.
 
              
Well, it took  a few 
--
 
a c ouple of weeks  before Mr . London c ould get the
 
    
per mit for me, but ever y m or ning and ever y evening I was  tak en by c ar to work, whic h was
 
    
wonderful exc ept it was  a glor ified pr is on, bec aus e wher e they lived was  very exc luded.
 
    
There was  no public  trans portation.  It was n't easy walking dis tance.  So I was s tuck
 
    
over  ther e.  As I s aid, it was  a glor ified pr is on.  I had lunc h at the 
--
 
with the s taff
 
    
in the factor y, but I was  as s igned to go to the pac king r oom .  There I lear ned how to
 
    
m ake k nots and how to pr otec t from pins , but that was n't m uc h of a pr ofes s ion.  So I
 
    
asked Mr. London to let me work in the m ac hine s hop, lear n how to s ew, but that was
 
    
inappropr iate at the time, s o the owner  to work  with girls, s o he s aid "no."
 
              
I got a s alar y of 1 pound, 30 s hillings a week .  I told Mr . London, you don't
 
    
have to give me that muc h money bec aus e, after  all, I live with you.  And he s aid, well,
 
    
that's  ok ay.  Well, I s aved it.  I c ouldn't s pend it, whic h was  okay.  And, well, that
 
    
went on for  a while, and I couldn't get into the mac hine s hop.  However , this  was  the
 
    
beginning of April of '39, and as  you know, the war  broke out in September.  The m om ent
 
    
the war br oke out, Mr . London told me that he and his  family are going to evac uate, but
 
    since I'm 
working, I s hould go and look  for  a plac e to s tay.
 
              
Well, now I look  for  a plac e to stay and then I ask  him , "I'd like to have
 
    
m or e m oney."  He told m e, "You c an't have anym or e."
 
              
It was  a little diffic ult.  I s till had lunc h 
at the factory, but, I m ean,
 
    
that was n't m uch food, becaus e I had to pay 14 s hillings  and 6
 p
enc e
, whic h is  equivalent to
 
    
$40 out of 20.  And I had to pay that for br eak fas t and bed

bed and break fas t,

bas ic ally.
 
              
I took  my bic yc
le.  I don't know wher e I got the bic yc le, I c an't remem ber how
 
    
I got it, but I had a German bic yc le with m e, and every mor ning I r ode to work .

well, I didn't get to write a letter anyway.  I tr ied to find som ebody to s pons or  my
 
    
par ents, but I was n't suc c es sful.
 
              
Anyway, I was  told not to ask too m any questions of people, to as k  for favors ,
 
    
and that was  a bad mis take.  You
 
s hould be mor e aggr es s ive as  far  as  your  c hildr en are

> > Henr y Kahn:  September 1st, the war  br oke out, and almost im mediately the
 
    
s ir ens  started blowing up, but it was  a fals e alarm, fortunately.  But now, s inc e I had
 
    
to 
--
 
s inc e I lived by mys elf, as  I said, I found a plac e in the north of London, whic h
 
    
was  m or e 
--
 
not quite as  exc lus ive in
 
the s uburb, and first of all, ther e was  the County
 
    
Sc hool walking dis tanc e fr om wher e I lived, and I took  advantage of this  and took  a
 
    
c ours e in book keeping, whic h had nothing to do with pac king or s ewing, but it c am e in
 
    
handy eventually.  Also there was a s ynagogue, and I went there, and I had a fr iend who
 
    
lived ac r os s the s tr eet fr om me.  So I had a s oc ial life.  It was  quite s om ething in
 

    
c om paris on to what I had in Stuttgart.
 
              
I went to s c hool and now I asked Mr. London to let m e wor k  in the s ewing
 
    
m ac hine room, bec aus e he c ouldn't s ay "no" anymore, bec aus e now I was  on m y own, and he
 
    
let m e do it.  Ver y s hortly after I started, I was  effic ient enough at it s o that I
 
    
asked to go on piec e wor k.  You get paid fo
r  eac h piec e you wor k .  I was  able to m ake 30
 
    
s hillings, whic h was  mor e than I would have gotten before, and that was  helpful.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, I want to ask you about s omething.  Right after the
 
    
war began in September  1939, you wer e c alled befor e a tribunal and a notation was  put in
 
    
your  r ec ord that s aid 
--
 
I'm going to read this  
--
 
"The holder of this c ertific ate is to
 
    
be exempted fr om fur ther  or der fr om internm ent and fr om the s pec ial r es tric tions
 
    
applic able to enem y aliens  under  the aliens  or der ."
 
              
And then later  in Dec em ber  your rec ord was  added to it with the words  "you ar e
 
    
a refugee fr om Nazi oppres s ion."
 
              
What did that mean?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  I'll tell you what happened.  Fir s t it was  okay.  I went to
 
    
work every day and I went to s c hool at night and I had a little s oc ial life, whic h was
 
    
gr eat.  But then in 1940, in May 1940, the Germans  
--
 
in the m eantim e the Germ ans s end
 
    
an expeditionary
 
forc e and in May 1940, the Nazis  invaded Holland and the s outh of
 
    
Fr anc e and the Britis h expeditionar y forc e was  c ut off and 300,000 of the Br itis h
 
    
s oldier s, Fr enc h and others, wer e able to es c ape top England, but all the equipment was
 
    
los t.  
So they got s c ared.  They got pan icky.  They panicked, and once they panic , they
 
    
dec ided to inter n the lot, in other  words , inter n everyone who c ame from  Germany,
 
    
bec aus e they r eally didn't know what to do anym or e.  And they did s tupid things  and 
that
 
    
was  one of them.  And the people who r eally would have helped them, they s hut up.  Well,
 
    
we wer e inter ned on the 3rd of J une 
--
 
J uly.  On the 3rd of J uly 
--
 
oh, befor e I was
 
    
inter ned, I notic ed and I found out that s everal of my acquaintanc es wer e inter ned.  So
 
    
before I was  inter ned, I took all the m oney which I had s aved up and took  it to the
 
    
Bloom s bur y Hous e, the agenc y that is  the s pons or  for the kids  from the Kinder tr ans port.
 

7 
 
    
And I gave the m oney and I s aid, get m e out as fast as pos s ible s o I c an get to the
 
    
United States  and buy m e a ticket.  They s aid, well, the money is n't quite enough, but
 
    
we'll m ake up the differenc e, whic h was  gr eat.
 
              
I apprec iated that, but things never  wor k  out the way you think .
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, just to m ake s ur e our audienc e under s tands , what
 
    
you've told us is  that even though England welc omed you on the Kindertrans port, even
 
    
though you wer e J ewis h and a refugee fr om the Nazis , in their panic , bec aus e
 
you wer e
 
    
Germ an and fr om  Germany, they forc ed you to be inter ned?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Of c ours e, that's what I s aid.  They were panicked.  They
 
    
panicked.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  I just want to make sure everybody under stands.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  They didn't know what they were doing.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  What did they do to you?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, as I s aid, I took  my m oney over ther e.  On the 3rd of
 
    
J uly, on the 2nd of J uly, when I c am e
 
hom e, I was  told that I have to report to polic e,
 
    
take all my stuff and go to the polic e s tation.  I went ther e and was  pr omptly interned.
 
    
On the 3rd to the 4th, we wer e taken to a rac e cour s e outs ide of London, and the next
 
    
day we got a big piec e of c hees e and that was  our pr ovis ion for the day. We wer e tak en
 
    
by train, all the inter nees  wer e taken by tr ain to live on theWes t Coas t of England.
 
    
It's  a port.  And ther e we wer e put into a c am p, whic h looked lik e a Nazi c amp.  It was
 
    
a tent c am p.
 
              
We wer e told that Liver pool had been bom bed the week  befor e and the s hip that
 
    
had taken to Canada has  been s unk and m any people dr owned.  So now we wer e asked, who
 
    
wants  to volunteer to be s ent to an overs eas dominion?  I
 
didn't k now what a dom inion
 
    
was , but I figur ed they c ould have s aid s o.  So I dec ided that I would tak e a c hanc e
 
    
with a tor pedo r ather than bom bs and m ac hine guns  and, God forbid, the Nazis  take over
 
    
and c aught by the Nazis  again.
 
              
Well, on the 10th we wer e taken aboard the s hip and all our luggage was  piled
 
    
on top of the top deck  and I was  as s igned to the bottom deck  in the fr ont of the s hip.
 
    
There were hooks on the c eiling, and I figur ed there wer e hamm ock s , and I eventua
lly I
 
    
got a hammock  and then I was  s leeping there, whic h was  good.
 
              
Anyway, the ver y night the s hip left the pier , and it was  rolling.  I couldn't
 
    
tell what the weather was  like.
 
              
As it tur ned out, they tried to avoid tor pedoes , and s ure enough, the torpedo
 
    
hit the s hip and made a dent but did not explode.  22 year s later 
--
 
that was  '62 or
 
    
'63, my wife and two s ons  m et my for m er  teac her  fr om theWaldorf Sc hool, and he told us
 
    
that after they were dis m is s ed fr om the s c hool, he had to find a job.  And he told m e 
--
 
    
he told us  he wor ked in the tor pedo fac tor y, and onc e in a while he s abotaged a torpedo
 
    
by putting s and in the mec hanis m.
 
              
[c huckles]
 
              
And for  all I know, he was  the one who s aved my life and a lot of other s.
 
              
Getting back to the s hip, it took  us about a m onth, and we went around the
 
    
Cape of Good Hope.  It was  a very s low s hip.  And we finally arr ived in Sydney,
 
   
 
Austr alia.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, I know ther e's muc h m or e for you to tell us .  J ust a
 
    
c ouple of things  about that trip.
 
              
Tell us a little bit about how you wer e tr eated, what the guar ds were like and
 
    
what happened to your  pers onal belongings.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, it's  a long stor y, but...
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Do a s hort ver s ion, if you c an.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, the s hip was  a tr oop s hip and providing for 1500 tr oops.

Now, there wer e 2500 
--
 
m or e than 2500 aboard, s o you c an imagine how c rowded it was ,
 
    
and many of the people had to s leep on the floor.  They s lept on the floor .  They
 
    
preferr ed it.  They didn't know how to go into a hamm ock , whic h I happened to know.  I
 
   
was  lucky I got m ys elf a hamm ock and s lept ver y c omfortably.
 
              
They didn't have enough of anything.  It was  rather s c arc e.  There wer e
 
    
s howers , yes , but there was  s eawater , and you c ouldn't do m uc h with seawater as  far as
 
    
c leaning your s elf is  c onc er ned.  So the m es s  got pretty bad.  And people got s eas ick, s o
 
    
I dec ided I'd do s om ething about it.  I got mys elf a few young guys  together like mys elf
 
    
and we as ked for buck ets  and broom s and we c has ed half the deck to one s ide of the
 
deck
 
    
and c leaned up, and then we went bac k  and c leaned the r est of it. Well, this  activity
 
    
gave us s ome benefits, whic h was  ver y good.  Bec aus e ins tead of having to run ar ound the
 
    
deck  ever y morning for half an hour  or s o, machine guns pointing at us  in either
 
    
direction, the few of us who c leaned the deck, we were able to go to the top of the deck
 
    
and enjoy the fr es h air, whic h was  quite s om ething.  It was  very valuable at the time, I
 
    
c an as s ur e you.  Well, anyway, after we got to 
--
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Here is what I wanted you to tell me.  You des c ribed in the
 
    
beginning you put your  luggage on top.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, yes, another stor y.  We had to put
 
all our luggage in a
 
    
big pile and they put a big c anvas  over  it.  I got on top of the deck , I notic ed that
 
    
the top had been taken off of the luggage, and the tr oops, not the c r eam of the c r op, as
 
    
far as  the Br itis h Arm y was  c onc er ned, there were one eyed and lim ping, and they helped
 
    
them s elves .  They opened up the luggage, and threw s tuff over boar d.
 
              
Well, this  was  a c rim inal offens e, of c our se, but nobody c ar ed about that at
 
    
the tim e.
 
              
However , it oc cur red to our benefit, becaus e another that had followed us , the
 
    
c aptain was  c urious what they had thr own over boar d, and he picked it up, and he notic ed
 
    
ther e wer e Ger man letters.  So he r ealized there are were Germ ans aboar d and he didn't
 
    
s hoot the torp
edoes , one way we wer e als o s aved.  I found that out vis iting Germ any
 
    
after the war, Stuttgart.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  I want to thank  you for telling us  that.  Now you'v e m ade it
 
    
to Austr alia after a ver y long tr ip.  Now you'r e in Aus tr ali
a.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  I know.  It took  us  over  a month.  It took  us over a m onth to
 
    
get ther e.  And we finally landed in Sydney, Aus tralia. We wer e tak en off the s hip. We
 
    
were tak en aboard the train.  It took  18 hours  into the inter ior.  We got there and it
 
    
was  Hay, a sm all village in the des ert, bas ic ally.  The s and was  blowing 
--
 
the wind was
 
    
blowing and the s and was  hitting us  like s andblas ting.  We got into that c am p and we had
 
    
s omething to eat and went to s leep.  The Australian s oldiers  wer e very nic e and very
 
    
kind.  Ther e was  no problem at all.
 
              
And I tell you s omething els e, while on the Duner a, one of the s oldiers , one
 
    
of the cream  of the cr op of the Britis h Arm y, they got s o dr unk  that they dr opped their
 
    
r ifle.  One of them  pick ed up the r ifle and took  him to the s ick  bay s o he c ould be
 
    
r ejuvenated.
 
              
Anyway, getting back to Aus tr alia...
 
              
Getting back to Aus tr alia, we got into that c am p and the ver y next m orning,
 
    
out of 2500 people, 13 nam es wer e c alled out.  Thirteen.  As far  as  I'm conc erned, it's
 
    
a very fortunate num ber.  Thirteen names wer e c alled out.  I was  the fir st one
 
on the
 
    
lis t.  And one of our 13 overheard the s oldiers  say, "Well, thes e c haps are going back
 
    
to England."
 
              
Well, we weren't asked and we didn't know what was  going on.  Any way, the 13
 
    
were tak en back  to the s hip, but ther e was  no
 
r oom, so we were taken to the bunker, and
 
    
we wer e loc ked up.  That is  the fir st tim e I r eally got s c ared, bec aus e I was  loc ked up,
 

9 
 
    
and I knew the s hip was  
--
 
ther e was  no c hance for  m e s urviving at all.  However, we got
 
    
s omething to eat and th
at m ade me feel better .
 
              
After  a while, we were taken out.  They had to find s omeplac e to put us , s o
 
    
they took  us  up to Malabar  Hill, Sydney.  One sec tion had been c or doned off with
 
    
bar bwir e and I was  in inter nment c am p.  And there was
 
one that got the paper  ever y
 
    
m or ning, and in it we saw that wher e I us ed to work went up in flam es .  And you c an
 
    
imagine how I felt about that.
 
              
Well, we were in that internment c am p on Malabar  Hill, and we were taken back
 
    
to the 
s hift and the s hift lifted anc hor, and lo and behold, they lifted anc hor and we
 
    
took off.  It took  a month to get to Sydney, but after two weeks , the s hip stopped and
 
    
the 13 of us were taken off.  The firs t thing I notic ed was  that ther e wer e all
 
 
   
dark
-
skinned people and r ed s pots on the floor.  And eventually I got an explanation for
 
    
all of it.  So we were taken to the polic e station and 13 of us  were inter viewed by
 
    
individuals , and the offic er  who interviewed me as ked all s orts of s illy
 
ques tions , and
 
    
he s aid to me, wher e do you live?  I s aid, well, I don't even know where I am and you
 
    
ask  me where I live?
 
              
So he had to find out.  So he c ame back  and he told me.  You live in a J ewis h
 
    
Relief As s oc iation Hom e in Bom bay, India.
 
              
Uh
-
huh.
 
              
[c huckles]
 
              
So that's  the fir st time I found out wher e I was .  So I was  in India.
 
              
We wer e taken to the J ewis h Relief As s oc iation Home, and we wer e told, we have
 
    
to report twic e a week to the polic e station, otherwis e we c ould walk around and do what
 
    
we wanted.  I was  not inter ned anym ore.  I was  free to m ove around in Bom bay.  I
 
    
c ouldn't leave the is land of Bom bay without perm is s ion, but that was  it.  So voila, I
 
    
was  free!
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Why did they live you in Bom bay when you wer e s uppos ed to go
 
    
back  to England?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, I was n't s uppos ed to.  The guy didn't know.
 
              
> > B ill B
ens on:  Okay.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  He as s um ed it.  And the reas on we were taken off is  bec ause,
 
    
as I mentioned before, it was  a tr oop s hip, which c arried 
--
 
whic h was  able to c ar r y
 
    
1500 troops, and the ship was  s c heduled to tak e Br itis h tr
oops  to the Middle Eas t to
 
    
fight.  So I was  with the other  12 in Bombay, and the tr oop s hip took  the s oldier s  to
 
    
the Middle Eas t.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would s tay in India for the dur ation 
--
 
you s tayed in
 
    
India for  the r est of
 
the war ?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Well, I'll tell you about that.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Okay.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  So now I c ould have asked to be s end back  to pr is on, but I had
 
    
no taste for that.  There was no reas on for  m e to go back  to England.  I wanted to get
 
    
to United States  eventually. Whic h eventually I did, but it took quite a few year s
 
    
before that.  Anyway, I was  in Bom bay now and I wanted to get 
--
 
learn som ething,
 
    
s omething that would help.  A gentleman from  the J ewis h Relief As s oc iation took  interes t
 
    
in the 13 of us and invited s ix of us  at one tim e and s even of us  
--
 
the other  s even at
 
    
another time, and we had a big m eal at his hous e.  He had a beautif
ul home, and I bec ame
 
    
fr iendly with him , and I ask him  to s ee if I c ould get a job learning s om ething. Well,
 
    
he knew s omebody in the mec hanic  bus ines s, and I c ould work  there for a while, but the
 
    
owner wouldn't allow me to do anything at all. 
 
And the as s istant, he s howed me a few
 
    
things, but bas ic ally I c ouldn't lear n anything.  I didn't get any m oney to s peak  of.  I
 
    
didn't even get enough money to pay for the fare, s o that was  no good.  I s aid, you have
 

10
 
 
    
to give me m or e money or teach m e s om ething or I c an't affor d to wor k  for you anymore.
 
    
So I tur ned things  ar ound.  He affor ding m e or I affor ding him.
 
              
So now, s inc e I had s om e knowledge in book keeping, as I told you, I had a
 
    
c hance to go to work  as  a bookkeeper.  A book keeper in a small offic e of a gentlem an who
 
    
had an c ons ulting engineer  offic e.  He was  a cons ulting engineer, quote, unquote, and he
 
    
was  tr ying to s ell s ome s tuff.  So I worked for him and I got 35
 
r upees , whic h was  an
 
    
impr ovement fr om
 
what I got from the last, but enough to get out of the home.  I wanted
 
    
to get out of there.
 
              
Well, I bought mys elf a little book keeping for  12
 
dollar s
 
and 6 c ents .  I
 
    
quickly read it and lo and behold I was  a book k eeper .
 
             
 
So now I worked for him for a while.  Then an opening c am e at the Indian Tool
 
    
Company, and it was  owned at the time by a Czec h gentleman, and he offer ed me a job to
 
    
s upervis e the night s hift.  Well, I was 17 years  old 
--
 
or 18 years old by then, a
nd I
 
    
was  s uppos ed to s uper vis e the night s hift.
 
              
Well, the qualific ation I had was ...
 
              
You unders tand?
 
              
[c huckles]
 
              
So I went there at 5:00 in the afternoon after  the people left, the workers
 
    
left.  I waited until about 8:00 when the night shift started.  Ther e wer e a few people,
 
    
about ten of them .  They wor ked on the lathe.  This  was  a tool c ompany that made s pits
 
    
for m aking holes .  They wer e s m all, eighth of an inc h to two inc hes .
  
And ther e wer e
 
    
m ac hines  that har dened.  It was  interes ting.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, I'm  going to jum p in for  a m inute.  Ther e's s ome
 
    
things I still want you to tell us about in the r emaining tim e.  One of them is ... tell
 
    
us about the fr iend of yours  fr om Ger many who wr ote a letter to your  par ents.  You had a
 
    
fr iend, Eric.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  That's months later, you know. Well, not months  later, that's
 
    
not tr ue.  While I was  
--
 
I had been in Madr as  and c am e back  and a very good fr iend of
 
    
m ine, whom I met in Kinder in Germany, and cons tant c ontac t, and I met him in England
 
    
als o.  He had gotten to the United States.  He was  in the United States Ar my and
 
    
as s igned to the c or ps , and he c ame to Bom bay, and
 
he m et s om ebody who knew that I had
 
    
c om e back from Madr as , and he c alled m e up and I m et him  for thr ee days .  And he 
--
 
    
that's  not right.  It's a little different.  He took  me to the PX, whic h was  v er y
 
    
im pres s ive, and on the s ec ond day he found out that his  m other passed away in New York,
 
    
and the thir d day he left.  I didn't s ee him again until I got to the United States in
 

    
'46.  But after  I got to Bom bay, a gentleman left for Amer ic a, and he 
--
 
and I asked him
 
    
to s ee that friend of
 
m ine who lived in New York , the s am e guy.  And when he 
--
 
he
 
    
imm ediately wr ote to my parents  to s ay that I am  s afe in India and m y par ents were
 

    
extr emely gr ateful.  They wrote a very nic e letter to m y friend, who in turn gave it to
 
    
m e eventually, and to thank him , bec aus e they didn't know what had happened to m e,
 
    
bec aus e there was  no news  at all.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Was that the last letter you ever  had fr om your parents ?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  That was the las t letter I g
ot from my parents.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  In the time we have left, Henry, tell us about Dor een.  Tell
 
    
us about...
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, after I had c ome bac k  from Madras , I was  ther e for about
 
    
thr ee quarter s of a year.  A friend of mine, he took  m e to the Mac c abi Sports Club, they
 
    
play Ping
-
Pong over  there and s tuff like that.  And there was  a girl who played
 
    
P ing
-
Pong.  And I thought I c ould play Ping
-
Pong, but s he beat m e m ost of t
he tim e, s o I
 
    
had to get even with her . What do you think  I did?  I m arr ied her.
 
              
[ Laughter ]
 

11
 
 
              
But that was n't right away.  Bec aus e when I got to the United States  in '46, I
 
    
prepared for  that als o.  But anyway, s even m on
ths after I got to the United States, I
 
    
was  c aptain in the army, and while I was  in the arm y, I went to the s tate depar tment and
 
    
s poke to som ebody over  ther e and ask ed them 
--
 
let's s ee 
--
 
I asked them whether they
 
    
c ould do anything for m y s wee
theart.  I had a
 
c onditional engagem ent with her.  In
 
    
other wor ds , if and when we meet again, and feel the s am e way about eac h other as we do
 
    
now, we get m arr ied.  We got m arr ied for  64 year s  until s he pass ed away in 2012.  And
 
    
while they didn't do muc h, but they told m e that s om ething c ould be done.  I was  in the
 
    
arm y.  I knew ther e wer e thr ee ways  of doing things , the r ight way, the wrong way and
 
    
the arm y way.  And the army it always  wor ks one way.
 
              
So her name was  Doreen.
  
She wor k ed ac r os s the s tr eet from  the Amer ic an
 
    
Embas s y, and one day s he got a c all and asked whether  s he s till wanted to get to the
 
    
United States .  She s aid yes.  So the next day s he got another  c all.  And s he was  told
 
    
"When do you want to go
?"
 
              
As s im ple as  that.
 
              
After  two and a half year s  and 113 letters  that we exc hanged, both of us  did,
 
    
we finally 
--
 
s he finally  arr ived in New York, and s he ar rived on the 9th of J une, 1948,
 
    
and on the 27th we bec am e hus band and wife... voila!
 
              
[Applaus e]
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, if you'r e ok ay with this , I want to read s omething
 
    
that Doreen wr ote that you s hared with m e.
 
              
Henry s har ed with me that Dor een wr ote on her jour nal new year's day, 1946.
 
              
This is  while they wer e s till in India.
 
              
"Danc ed every dance with Henr y and s o ends  1945 with no r egrets , the m os t
 
    
interes ting year  I've ever experienc ed."
 
              
What a love s tory.
 
              
So the las t thing I have to ask you about, Henry, befor e we c los e the pr ogram,
 
    
when did you lear n about what happened to your parents ?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  About what?
 
              
>> Bill Bens on:  When did you lear n about what happened to your  parents ?
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn: Well, while my wife was  alive, I didn't do anything with the
 
    
Holoc aus t bec aus e s he had no inter es t in that.  We did everything together.  I wa
s a
 
    
m em ber with her of the National Counc il of J ewis h Wom en.  However , after  s he pas s ed
 
    
away, I dec ided I would wor k  in the Holoc aus t Mus eum , whic h I did.  And ther e I found
 
    
out that my parents had been s ent in '41, to Lodz, to the c onc entration c amp over ther e.
 
    
My father eventually died in '43, I believe, and m y m other s urvived until '44, and
 
    
apparently s he was  in a for c e m arc h to be s ent bac k  to Germ any.  However, the Nazis ,
 
    
they let them go to the border  of Germany in Poland.  The
y wer e for c ed to dig their own
 
    
gr aves  and then they wer e m ac hine gunned.
 
              
So that's  the stor y of m y m other.  Not everybody was  as  lucky as  I was .  In
 
    
fac t, the major ity of people wer e les s  for tunate than I was .  And I was  an exc eptiona
l 
    
exc eption, I would s ay.  I didn't hear a s hot in earnes t during the whole war.
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to turn back to Henr y in a m inute.  It's our
 
    
tr adition at Fir s t Per s on that our Fir st Per s on gets  the last wor d, s o Henry will
 close 
    
our  progr am.  As you c an tell, we c ould have s pent the r es t of the afternoon, ther e wer e
 
    
s o many details  and other stor ies that Henry c ould have told us .  So we don't get to
 
    
hear thos e, and not an opportunity for you to ask  him ques tions
 
fr om the audience, but
 
    
Henry is  going to s tay up here when he finis hes and we invite anybody who would like to
 
    
c ome up on s tage to come up and meet Henry, s hake his hand, get your pic ture taken with
 
    
him, or  ask him  a ques tion if you have one, if that's okay with you, Henry.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  Okay, s ur e.
 

12
 
 
              
> > Bill Bens on:  Before I turn it back  to Henr y, let me thank  you all for
 
    
being her e.  Rem ind you, we'll have a Fir st Pers on progr am eac h Wednes day and Thur s day
 
    
until the middle of Augus t and we hope you c an join us  again this  year .  If not, in
 
    
2017.
 
              
So with that I'm  going to tur n it back to Henry to c los e today's program.
 
              
> > Henr y Kahn:  If you know s om ebody whom  you hate and you r eally have a ver y
 
    
good reas on to hate him , rem em ber, do not generalize and do not as s ume that everybody in
 
    
the s ame c ategor y, ever ybody with the sam e bac k gr ound is the s ame.  Dis c r im inator y and
 
    
j
udic ious  and m ake s ur e that you don't prejudice what you think about the other people.
 
    
You'r e justified in hating that one pers on, but do not ever  generalize.  That's my
 
    
s ugges tion.
