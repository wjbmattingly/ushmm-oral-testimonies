A: You put an Abe because I prefer that I was Abe.  

 

Q: Okay, no problem.   

 

A: I never changed my na me.  

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: So I said my  name is Abraham Berg
ma n.  I was born June 15, 1924 in Krasnik, 
K-r-a-s-n-i-k which is Poland, the district of Lublin. 
 

Q: Lublin? 

 

A: The district is Lublin, the country is
 Poland.  Whe n I was three years old, I was 
going, three years old, I was going to 
cheder, which is Jewish school 
 

Q: Don™t mi nd me .  I™ m just going to take 
notes so you can keep going ahead.  Don™t 
-- you don™t have to worry about me . 
 

A: By seven years old, I started public sc
hool.  Public school which I was very good 
and I liked it.  Unfortunately, 1938 when I 
finished public school I wanted to go 
further but till I decided, the 
war broke out, September 1, 1939. 
 

Q: Okay.  Let me  slow down a little a
nd let me  ask you a few questions about your 
childhood.  Is that okay/ 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Can you tell me a little
 bit about your town?   Ho
w big it was, the Jewish 
population–? 
 

A: I don™t know how muc h population was ther
e.  I think like about 10,000.  It was a 
Jewish town. 
 

Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about your fa mily?   What your family was like? 
 

A: My fa mily, my mother, I didn™t have sin
ce I was two years old.  My father lately 
rema rried to another town.  I was brought
 up by my grandmother.  The age I was 
a completely orphan. 
 

Q: Did you have any br
others or sisters? 

 
 
2
 
A: No.  I did not.  I was the only child.  
But my father, when he rema rried, probably 
there were two children, I think.  But 
I never was together with them only 
vacation time, to the ot her grands and to my
 father for two weeks and that™s all.  
Last time  I saw my father was 1938.  That
™s it, wa s in a different town.  Since 

then, all kind of stories and the story is 
I never met hi m.  He don™t live and that™s 
it. 
 

Q: Okay.  What did your father do for a living? 

 

A: Tailor. 

 

Q: He was a tailor, right. 

 

A: They were all tailors. 

 

Q: He was a World Wa r I veteran, 
you were telling me  earlier, right? 
 

A: No, no. He wasn™t a war veteran.  No, 
no.  That was when he was twenty years 
old and they grabbed him and they took hi
m to Russia.  It™s not like a World Wa r 
veteran. 
 

Q: So he never really fought in th
e war, he just got taken to --? 
 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: Isee. 
 

A: That™s all.  That was in 1914. 

 

Q: Do you remember much about like the 
town and the kids you played with --? 
 

A: Oh, yeah, yeah. 

 

Q: --when you were younger?   Did you play w
ith, did you have lots of Jewish friends 
and also gentile friends? 
 

A: Mostly it was Jewish fr iends.  As a matte
r of fact, we are here like six or seven 
boys and one girl which we we
nt together to school.  Which they survived, a lot 
of them did not survive.  That girl, ri
ght, she™s a grandmother, she lives in New 
Jersey.  A few boys here, old 
friends, which we went togeth
er to cheder.  We went 
from the first to the seventh class, we ar
e together.  I have a friend here, not far 
from here and we meet together.  We 
have our -- everyone, that™s since 1900™s 
that emigrated here, they made societie
s, like our society, the Krasnik Society, 
which we meet every month and we do in
 charity everything and so on between 
us and for Israel and in general.  Now,
 for instance, in th
e wintertime we don™t 

 
 
3
have because  we all ol der people, so they are in Fl orida here and there.  Ma rch, 
we start again, which we used to meet 
in Manhattan.  Now, 
mo st live in Brooklyn 
so we meet here in ______ Heights Congreg
ation.  We make  a 
party once a while; 
we have our own ce me tery and so on.  
That™s almost every home town has but a 
lot, like the youth, don™t go in so they gi
ve up.  Which I™m trying now to take in 
my kids to it.  Of course we had friend
s; we played together
, we went to school 
together, yes, yes.  Other 
than Jewish friends, very lit
tle.  I especially had a few 
because, as I said, we live d in a street
, one side wa s Jews and one side was non-
Jews.  But mostly like the little towns, most of i t  populated from the Jews.  Like 

the surroundings around, like the farmers 
and this, they lived around the town.  

They called it in Jewish ____________ the shtetl. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I would say a big city for us a Lublin, 
that was diffe rent.  But the little towns 
where I come from, that was --.  The 
fe w Jews lived in the city and the 
surrounding around lived the non-Jews but 
we went together to school and 
everything.  Naturally, the pub
lic school, not the cheder. 
 The cheder, Jews.  It 
was like a ghetto life.  That time we di
dn™t realize now.  Now we realized, we live 
in a big city, all kinds of nationalities, we
 realized that it™s a 
different life.  But 

those days, was that kind of life. 
 

Q: Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism?  

 

A: Oh, yes, plenty. 

 
Q: Can you tell me  about some  of those? 
 

A: See here two bones?   That™s still a me
mory.  When it came , not that I™m going to 
be prejudiced whatsoever but I have to talk out the way it was then. 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: Yes.  Like for instance, here we cele
brate a Christma s altogether nice whether you 
believe or not, we celebrate together.  I liv
ed with neighbors, Italian; I am Jewish.  
It™s Hanukkah, I put out the can
dles; they put out whatever
 it is.  It™s mutual. But 
there it wasn™t unfortunately.  I have to 
say the way it is whether you™re Christian, 
whether you™re believe r or not.  You do this, to say as it was.  Very anti-Semitic.  

The Polaks, very stupid.  They only know
 one thing. We  Jews killed our God!  
That™s what they knew.  For instance, it came, let™s say twice a year you have for 

two or three weeks, a holiday from 
the school.  Once a year, vacation, two 
months.  Let™s say that twi
ce a year like Christ mas time 
or Easter, right?   The two 
holidays is about Jesus Christ -- I woul
dn™t say us Jews.  We  knew a little bit 
more those days what™s with Jesus a
nd what™s the story.  They didn™t know 
nothing; they only knew one thing.  You k
illed our God!  If he is a god, how can 
you kill hi m?   Alright, now I am di fferent than I was then.  Tough on Judaism 

 
 
4
also.  Because I know more the reality; I 
am mor e  educated and so on and so on.  
That time I was Jew 100%.  Now I™m born Jew, I am Jew but I™m different.  Not 
agreeing with everything -- so going, let™
s say it was the Christmas holiday, the 
last day of the holiday, the last day in 
school before the holiday.  Then the action 
for two, three weeks.  They came with stri
ngs and to the string attached weights, 
like a kilo we ight, a half a kilo weight and that™s the way.  They knew that they 

were going out from the  school.  If it ha
ppened during the day, I go to the teacher 
and I put a report, some thing happens.  
Not too much, but some thing.  But this 
time he knows in the afternoon, he™s out 
from the school for 
three weeks -- kill 
that Jew, hit that Jew.  So that™s th
e wa y they were hitting.  You came home 
bloodied, with blood, with faces like this.  
You killed our God!  That was the only 

thing.  That was Christmas time.  It came  ---.  
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: It came before Easter, I reme mber, like
 today, when you went to school, how far 
was it?   A mile?   You went through the ma in
 street like they call it here Kasioska, 
there was the movie.  As a matter of fact, 
from the movie was  a Jew.  At that time  

wasn™t movies like today.  There was outsi
de all the pictur es what the mo vie is.  
The movie was calling G____.  Now, why, it™
s not Polish, ma ybe it was ---.  That 
was all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: When you pass there, it™s the same  thi
ng, it™s the same  thing.  Anti-Semitism was 
very big.  Let™s say Saturday afternoon, we
 were juvenile boys, we went out for a 
walk in the main street.  As I sai
d, the whole shtetl was Jews.  Around -- so 
Polaks _______ when they came out.  Unfortunately it happened to me  this week 

I told you.  When they came out, we were walking.  Oh, you Jew!  Bang!  It 

happened to me  this week, almost the same  thing.  Where I work on Seventh 

Avenue between 38
th
 and 37
th
 Street.  I leave work at a quarter to six.  You go out, 
it™s a big traffic of people.  
I have to go this way to 42
nd
 Street station but people, 
_____ they going en ma sse to the station, 
to the Pe nn station.  One young fellow, 
taller than you -- it was raining.  Alright, 
a short fellow like me with the umbrella, 

ma ybe I didn™t have it down, the umbrella.  Alright, while wa lking you walk this 

way, this walk that way.  But one tall guy, a young fellow came  towards me  and 

like this with his rear almost to my f
ace.  What™s the me mory?  I shouldn™t say 
what.  You son-of-a-bitch Œ he could have gone and killed me .  I was sorry after 

what I said but it remi nd me  of the years 
in Poland.  But alright, some time s, as I 
said, you said excuse me , he didn™t, alri
ght.  But this, a young fellow, so it remi nd 
me of this.  Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn™t 

let them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew.
  You killed our God, you Jew killed 

our God.  I loved the school, I was going to
 the school.  I loved it, I wanted to go 
further whether I coul d afford or not.  But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was 

very big.  We had in our home town, we
 had the gymnasium.  It™s like here, 

 
 
5
college.  Here gymnasium is like for the ______.  But very seldom a Jew could go 
in, even if he could pay. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big.  
A Jew couldn™t ge t too much of it.  They 
say it is -- they say -- he couldn™t get to
 a higher -- no.  They felt it in the school, 
on the street; they felt it all over, all 
over.  The Germans, they knew where to 
make the crematoriums.  They didn™t make
 too many in Czechoslovakia, different 
people.  Same  Catholics, different.  But 
in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the 
camps were in Poland.  I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown.  I 

didn™t have to run away.  I could have walked away but where?   You walk away 

and the Polak will give  you for a kilo ______, for two pounds of sugar.  If not for 

him, I woul d run, always on the run.  He 
didn™t let me.  The last three months we 
were not toge ther.  This because they 
separated us whatever.  But whenever I 
wanted to go, run --.  One year we we
re on the camp near our hometown.  I was 
going out from the camp.  I was that time,
 I was a bricklayer.  Bricklayer, 
ceme mting, this and that.  You were looking 
for places that you should be inside.  
Because fighting with hunger is one fight
 but fighting with the weather and the 

cold, two fights was way too hard.  You 
were looking for Œ but looking; it™s not 
you™re given application.  But I ws 
a young fellow, I don™t know. They tell me  

that I am s mart and this and that.  Fine, 
inside, going out for sand, for this.  Let™s 
say a village nearby and going out for lime, 
to dig lime, I could have gone away.  
That was in 1942, I had no guards over me .  
Onl y me  and the polka with the horse 
and carriage.  All of a sudden I hear 
a voice.  Wh at is the voice?  Hey you, boy-
fellow, how can I get into the camp?   I saw he™s a Jew.  I says, who are you?   He 
tells me  the name .  In the villages, very few Jews lived.  The ones who lived, you 
knew his name  even if you didn™t know hi m.
  I am Zalek Division he said.  I look 
at him.  Wh y do you want to go into the cam
p?   I haven™t got place where to go.  I 
gave them away everything Œ all mi ne wh
atever, gone.  I don™t want to hear.  I 
haven™t got where to go.  I™m sick and 
tired already.  What™
ll happen, will happen, 
what we were told will be with me .  I says don™t do it.  It™s not so easy to get in 

because you got all -- they counting you, you come  in, they counting you.  It was 

not a question to run away.  The questi
on was, where will I hide?   I see the 
German, the uniform, I r un away from hi m.  But I see a Polak, do I know which 

one is good and which one is no good?   But 
I still wanted to run away.  But he 
didn™t let me.  He was then -- he like 
24 years difference from me .  I was a young 
boy, 18, 19 years.  Run, no.  Besides this, if
 you going to run away, they take the 
next ten and they kill.  Especially first was the family, it™s the same  na me , you 

can™t deny.  So that was the 
story.  We suffered in th
is hometown -- it was four 
kilometers from the hometown.  When we 
got to work they came for this work 
with a horse and carriage to give a day™
s duty, performa nce, whatever.  What did 

they do for us?   They didn™t have to do, ju
st look away.  yes, you gave them the 
good shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread.  But we knew, for two 

pounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclama tion:  If you bring one Jew a 

 
 
6
fa mily, two pounds of sugar, they did it. 
 Isn™t that a shame?   Don™t do for me  
good but don™t do it for me  either. 
 
Q: Can you tell me  a little b
it about when the Germans first got to your ---, when the 
war started and the Germans first come  to your town? 
 

A: Well, the war star ted Sept ember the 1
st
.  Naturally, as the war is, bombs with 
everything, whatever.  I didn™t understa
nd too much.  I didn™t know too much.  
Two weeks later, the Germans came  i nto
 our hometown.  It happened, it wa s the 
first, or the second day of Rosh Hashana
h, the New Year™s.  Of course, we didn™t 
believe it or not in the synagogue.  It™s 
not like the big town, 
every corner you had 
a synagogue.  In the little to
wns, I don™t know how it wa
s in the big towns, the 
little town was a shul and a basm _____ . 
 That means one is the synagogue and 
one is like other than a synagogue.  Le
t™s say the synagogue every Saturday, the 

basm ____ was for every day, day and night, 
even to go in for a whole night, if 
you were cold, to warm up.  So it™s Rosh
 Hashanah, New Year™s.  Before New 
Year™s people like leaders grabbed th
e scrolls, the Torah, which you probably 
know, the scroll and they br
ought them.  Let™s say, this one brought to his house 
and around the neighbors, we prayed there.  
Wa s the first day or the second day of 

Rosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shoo
ting and this and that.  A week before, 
it was bombs, which people got killed al
ready, in front of me .  One woma n got 
killed -- I run out with a 
cover to cover her and so on.  The second day they came 
in so naturally, we all star
t praying, we were afraid.  
After the Germans s t art to go 
around, nothi ng will ha ppen, everyt hi ng is 
quiet, we should go out on the street 

norma l.  About two, three days
 later started the feelings of the German.  First they 
took -- in Polish they call it 
_____, hostages.  Let™s say this 
one is a rich one, they 
went into the ma gistrate, to the ______- a
nd they got through the big Jews.  They 
took this one, they took this one, they took th
is one.  One they killed right away to 
show us what™s all about it 
if we don™t -- if we revolt against them or wha t .  It 
started, they were there.  Naturally 
-- and we didn™t know.  Now we know what 
the politics was between Stalin and H
itler.  They made some kind of --. 
 

Q: Pact? 

 

A: Pact.  We  didn™t know that.  All of a 
sudden, we hear the Russians are a couple of 
kilome ters from our town.  The next day th
ey came in a patrol; with a tank and the 
school square where I we nt to school.  
We  all around to look; everybody looked.  
The Germans were laying down looking 
at the tank ______ and so on.  I didn™t 
understand Russian but it™s almost similar. 
 All the people understood.  They said 
like they are twenty kilometers fr om us.  
It™s mor e  possibility that they™re going to 
turn back till the Bok, the River.  That™s
 what happened, they turned back.  A lot 
of people in those towns where they were, 
not far from us, they went along with 
them. 
 

Q: They went with the Russians? 

 

 
 
7
A: Yeah.  Youth, mostly youth. 
 

Q: Did you think about doing that? 

 

A: That™s what I want to bring out.  
My grandmother, she was my mother, she 
brought me  up.  She ways to me , Avul
 _____ that means my name , Avul ____ 

run, run.  I said how can I leave you. 
 The grandfather was laying in bed 
paralyzed.  He couldn™t move, he couldn™
t talk.  It was na
turally, seven years 
already.  The only one because he and me , we we re in the town.  But he was a 

businessman with his wife and children 
and I was near my grandmother.  So 
nobody understood it, only me .  For  instance, 
they bombed before they came in.  I 
took him on my back, as little as I was, 
and I dragged him to a cellar whatever.  
He says I don™t want to live no mo
re.  So nobody understood him, that™s enough 
for me .  My grandmother says, go run.  I says, where I™m going to run?   Leave 

you with the sick grandfather? No.  Those 
days wasn™t like today but I am today 
in this respect, I am today ess _____ in th
is respect, no time  old fashioned like.  
I™m American, I™m modernized
 but in this respect, I don™t want my pleasure I 
want my fa mily to give _____.  So I says no, 
that™s all there is to it.  After he run 
away with his wife and children to a vill
age, people were running even before 
they came in.  How could I, I wouldn™t 
go nowhere.  Then it started with the 
Germans.  They were there -- people 
ran, people came back.  Naturally youth 
people.  I had friends, people came back; th
ey got stuck.  They couldn™t go back, 
they went to concentration camps.  They
 started, every day, you have to go work. 
 

Q: What kind of work were they ma king people do? 

 
A: All kind of work. 
 

Q: Anything? 

 

A: Even, God forbid, it was a bad winter with snow.  The fellows they came with 
horse and carriages to the to
wn, they were laughing like 
this.  Hey Jew, hey Jews, 
you cleaning for us.  Like th
is, all standing in the roa
d, that was the me mory it 
was.  It was plenty snow; God gave us also plenty _____.  Poland had also a pact 

with Hitler and Stalin.  Be sides this, th
ey found a lot of work.  The mi nute they 
came in, our home town was an industrialized
 city.  It was like in central Poland.  
My grandmother told me in the other war, 
they came  in and they got out.  So they, 
the Polaks, were building ammunition places and so on and so on.  Lately they 

found it out that mostly the architects a
nd everything, they were Germans and it 
was everything and they ma de big places ar
ound the city.  There they took us to 
work.  What was then to do?   The Polaks, the farmers, they had to bring in the 

tags like.  What was the tags?  The grai
n and so on and so on.  We were working 

there, shipping there on the wagons, it was 
all kinds of work to do.  There was a 
big Œ then the Germans started there to ma
ke, they figure out already that they™re 
going to go in war with Russia.  Now we
 know it.  All of a sudden, there was a 
valley which it was filled from the Polaks. 
 They took it away and they started to 

 
 
8
build a -- in German, they call it ___
__.  What does it mean? That means 
gasolines, with oils, with everything to
wards the war.  On the ground, they took 
us, we had to go every day from the house 
to work which the Judenrat -- probably 
you heard of the Judenrat -- they send you 
-- every day off to work.  If you didn™t 
go, they came  for you with the Jewish poli
ce and they arrested you.  Let™s say if I 
didn™t have a few days™ work for me , I 
went out on the square there; you came 
along, you gave me  ten zlotys, I work for 
you. First I look to who has.  Every day 
I was at work.  Whether voluntarily or 
not, being home , they going to catch me  
just the same .  I needed a couple zlotys  to ma ke a living.  In the meanti me, you 
were at work, the Polaks brought in 
potatoes and all kinds of vegetables. 
 

Q: You™d steal them, yeah? 

 

A: You steal some thing, you brought home  
and the grandmother cooked it and so on 
and so on.  You worked there and we built
 a top that thing al
so.  The rail was 
going and the ______ by the Polaks and they di d that.  Enough so that half a year 

later, they started the war so everyt hing 
was from us.  The first station to send 

them the work.  Then they make a 
hanger _____, it™s a big Œ airplanes, they 
started.  We  didn™t ma ke them but we  fi
xed them and everything and so on.  Like 
in 1943, was the first aus ____ means to send away the people.  They knocked it -

- yes, before that, in spring, all of asudden, that was ™43, in the mi ddle of the 

night, they came  and says from Lublin to
 the Judenrat and they told them what 
they want them to do.  We didn™t k
now.  They knocked at every door, every 
Jewish door, the Judenrat, the Jewish police,
 had to show them which is a Jewish 
home .  They knocked on every door and th
ey kicked them out on the square, on 
the school place there with Germans a nd Jewish police, Polish police around, to 
watch them who they took out.  I lived inthat house, as I said, on the other side 
was Polak.  My grandfather died already. 
 He died right in ™40 which now, next 
month is the anniversary, 50 year, in 1940. 
 He says 52.  I, with the grandmother 
in our house.  He lived at the end of the st
reet with his in-laws.  There was he and 
his wife, three children.  There was a 
brother-in-law.  He came back from 
Brussels in ™38.  Three years he couldn™t 
stay, the war goes, he came back.  When 
he came back from Marseille till German -- he had to go by train -- when he saw 

everything, he said, give me  a little bo
at and I go back already.  He saw 
everything.  Hi m and his son 
and his wife, and another 
brother-in-law with a son, 
they all took out.  There was the  ___
____ that saved him, from seven o™clock 
until si x in the morning.  Six o™cloc k in the morning, they knocking on our door.  

My grandmother said, you 
don™t go,  I™ll go to the door. 
 You hide under the bed.  
She yells out, who is it, who is it?   She 
says, mother-in-law in Jewish, schiga, it™s 
Liah, open up.  She™s crying.  She opens 
up, she come s in and cries.  They took 

away everybody from their house, ex
cept the wome n, except her with the 
children.  The sister, the son they took 
and the mother.  They took everybody.  We  
didn™t know from nothing.  They didn™t ac
t from under but she says it™s going on 
Œ renting people to go.  I said, you go out
 and see what you can do and I go and 
change it.  My grandmother,
 she should rest wherever she is, she says no.  I says, 
look if they are going to take away h
im ______, we all going to die from hunger.  

 
 
9
If I going to be away, he™s going to be here
.  I was a child.  They say what kind of 
business you ma ke, you didn™t ma ke business.  But what he had, from the 
tailoring, from the ma gaz i nes, he sold 
some thing.  I couldn™t do it, I didn™t know, 
I was a child.  I said, Jetma, please let me  go and see.  Naturally it was going on 

like a stock market.  Wh oever gave money, 
got it.  She didn™t give money, I went 

to _____.  She was running there and back. 
 By four o™clock was a shooting and 
they took almost four kilome ters to the st
ation.  They took them all to the station 
and from there they didn™t know where.  They started to find out, we find out 

where they are.  They separate them into two camps.  He wa s in a different camp, 

his brothers-in-law were in
 a different.  It was near the Russian border which 
before the wa r was there.  I would say, very
 big jails from the Polaks.  They called 
it Ka_____.  There they send away like sp
ies or whoever didn™t ma ke right 
business or didn™t pay taxes Œ there they
 land.  Well, you start with some  people 
with a horse and carriage, they went there.
  They started, after 
six weeks, naturally 
you have to give money.  Me, and I have one
 fellow in Israel and one fellow here, 
we went to change them.  They came  t
o, hey, you little guy, y
ou going to change?   
I said, I firsr paid.  After six weeks, I ch
anged him.  This was like forced labor.  
He was writing if you not going to take me
 out, I™ll die there.  The water wa s 
straight out of the river, 
which is going a little river 
to the big river, the Bok, 
which was the border between Russia and Germa ny.  The water was so Œ you 

went into the water, pieces
 of your foot fell out like. 
 

Q: From the wa ter? 

 

A: From the waters -- something like.  Th
e air it was so light, 
you could have pulled 
down so mu ch and I was working there.  
Came  in Nove mber, instead to go home , 
we heard some thing going around.  Every mont h, like say, came  a horse and 

carriage with food for me for this, because
 they were home.  Ca me  in November 
instead to -- we thought we
 going to go home , we heard 
rumors that they were 
going to take us to the forest now to c
hop woods.  He heard that, he paid off for 
me and I should come home.  That was already Nove mber. 
 

Q: This is now 1943? 

 

A: Yeah.  Then I don™t remember exactly 
the date; they knocked at the doors on a 
Sunday and all out on the ma rket.  I don™t 
reme mber whether this was -- no, this 
was after.  It was like in April, May, no, 
no.  This wasn™t 1943.  This was ™41, the 
story what I told you. 
 

Q: The one you just told me  was in ™41? 

 

A: Forty-one. 

 

Q: Was that before Œ that was right afte
r the war with the Soviet Union started? 
 

A: No, that was 1940. 

 
 
10
 
Q: Forty.  She left before they inva
ded the Soviet Union, the Germans did? 
 

A: Right, right.  That was ™40.  Because they came in September, 1939.  This was in 
1940.  Grandfather died the beginning of
 1940.  This was 1940, Easter time .  We 
came home  i n 1940, the end of 1940.  Then in 1941 --. 
 

Q: Can I ask a question real quick?   Wa s 
there a ghetto -- when they came in, the 
Germans came in to your town -- did they set up a ghetto imme diately? 
 

A: Notyet. 

 

Q: Not yet?   Okay. 

 

A: I will come  to it, not ye t.  This wa
s 1940.  In 1941, in March, April, they knocked 
at every door, it was on a Sunday, I think.  They took us out on the ma rket.  

Everybody.  What can you take with you?   My grandmother she had to take -- 

whatever she took with her, how you call 
it when you die?   A shroud, that™s what 
she had with her because she wasn™t as 
committed and that™s what she had with 
her.  They took us out and we™re standing in
 the market; it™s full.  Here, over this 
goes on a stock ma rket, a bazaar.  The Jude
nrat, was sitting there an ol d ____ with 
beard, came over the  Judenrat to him and th
ey wanted to take him out.  He said 

no.  What, what nobody knew.  Aft e r an hour 
or two standing in the ma rket, five 
by five, five by five, to the railroad stati
on which I me ntioned is four kilome ters.  
We came  to the railroad station and st a
nding there by the railroad station and they 
start sorteering, sort-like.
  There was the arbeitzan, the guy from the labor 
departme nt from the Germans.  We called him -- by everyone and usually in the 

little town, you had a nickname .  You didn™
t know very ma ny except in school.  

But in order for the Germans not to know 
what we are saying, so we call here 
such a chin, so we call him the ____ which 
in Polish Œ Jewish ----.  It was a 
German but in civil. Every morning when you went to pl ace yourself to go to 

work, first by the Judenrat, then by the 
arbeitzen the Germans and the Judenrat 
and they saw that you were there, you were
 there, you were here.  They were only 
interested in staying and 
taking you.  So naturally I was there almost every day.  
He knew me  very well.  All of a sudde
n, he says to me  in German, hey ________, 
hey young fellow, what are you doing here?  
 Wh ere is your family.  I had my 
grandmother Ria.  Over there, people
 were separate.  I hear yelling, Avum 
____Avum_ ___, that™s me .  Abraham, Avumera l , a little one is Avumera l , a big 

one is Ava.  David, Davidol.  His wife a
nd she is yelling.  Her sister with her 
husband --. 
 

Q: Your uncle™s wife you mean?  

 

A: Yeah.  Avumeral, I look she is yelling. Even now, fire, water, I don™t care, I go.  
To save someone, I go.  My grandmother 
says where are you going?   I says to 
Tante ____.  They hit me , go back.  Her si
ster and the husband what I me ntioned 

 
 
11
and the other brother with a son and th
e mother, they pulling Liah, come , come , 
we™ll have  a good place on the train.  They
 were standing cattle and she, the 
mi nute, she had a feeling she didn™t want to go, to have a good place.  Wh en swhe 
saw me , then more of it.  This going back
 to that labor departme nt, that guy, he 
pulls me  out.  Where is your fa mily?   My
 grandmother, next to me , and he pulls 
me  standing people like by the building wher
e the station is.  We standing there 
and the police with guns, they push them to the wagons and us, they turning back 

to go home.  While we were going home , 
they we re waiting horse and carriage, 
they prepared.  They call it the ____ from 
the Polaks.  They took people on back 
but me  with my grandmother till what, there 
was no.  So we were walking.  As we 
were walking the four kilome ters, we 
found plenty dead people; all the people 
which we knew them very well.  Probably
 they couldn™t walk, they shoot them.  
We go about three kilome ters, almost our town.  Our town was on hills but the 

ma in town was in a valley.  But it wa s a lot of hill down.  When you™re st anding 

on this si de of the town, you could see th
e whole town until over the ot her hill.  
We come  and already they call it 
the w______ b______, the wide mount ain.  You 
go into the town, come s along a Polak on his 
horse and carriage and he says to my 
grandmother which he knew her when probably they came to buy suits, he says to 

her, Altaruver that means my grandfathe
r was alta, she is Altaruver, die son 
Herschek is home .  Wha t  did he say?  
I says, Grandma, you heard what he said.  

What, is he joking?   They didn™t do 
enough to us?  The Polaks_____.  As we 
come  on the top of the hill to go down to th
e town, we see lights 
in his house.  I 
say grandmother; she says probably the 
Polaks they already plundering, stealing.  

It was like half an hour ago, ma ybe took ten mi nutes.  We  come  into the house.  

He is there with his wife and with 
his children and crying over.______ the name  
of her sister to have a good place.  When
 I saw you, she says, I didn™t want to go.  
What was the reason?  Now, we knew the reason after, when we came  ba ck.  

When that arbeit_____, it means the labor departme nt, a German, he looked 

around, it was like to send away half a to
wn.  The Judenrat knew it but we didn™t 
know it.  When he looked around, everybody looked for hims elf, especially the 

Germans.  The German like this, if he  wouldn™t ha ve that function, where will he 

go?  in the wa r.  Nobody wanted to go in
 the war, no ma tter how patriotic they 

were, how good it went for them.  He  had 
a function in this city, it™s good.  He 

looked around, he saw that there is more
 than a half gone and who rema i ned?   
Older people, he wants to have the labor he 
needs.  So he run to the station and he 
took out the people.  Of course we came  in
to his house.   Then he says right away, 
go home  to our house.  Because in our house, was everythi ng so we went there.  

That was 1941.  Every day, to work, we sa
w already what the Germans are and so 
on and so on.  There wasn™t a family that
 people wasn™t mi ssing.  After we found 
out, they took them to Belzec.  There, 
nothing more to hear.  What can I sa y how 

the turn was black, like in Jewish they 
say, Schwarz.  Every day goes on work in 
this and that.  I worked in the shop.  
Before they took away, as soon as the 
Germans came in, they took away 21 youths, I show you in the book, our 

home town.  The nicet youth, 21, 22, they took them away in the mi ddle of the 

night after they ---.  So every day to 
work, it come s for the two.  In 1941, broke 
out the war with Russia. 

 
 
12
 
Q: InJune? 

 

A: June 4, June 21
st
 I think, I reme mber it good because in our town, all the 
machinery, all the Germans, military and 
everyt hi ng that the people said look at 
the road -- it™s lower down almost a me
ter.  Such a _____ and everything.  You 
never saw anything like it and 
it st arted the war.  When it started the war, it stayed 
in our place where we worked, was a whol
e, everything to fixi ng.  There came  
one soldier with 30, 40 tanks to repair.  
He begged us, he gave us to eat; slow 
down, nonsense, slow down, slow down. B
ecause otherwise, as soon as it 
finished, have to go back.  I don™t wa nt to 
go back.  I want to stay with you there.  
Every day in the morning we went to wor
k.  You walked like fi
ve, six kilome ters 
every day and in the evening you came  
home.  Sometimes they gave a truck, 
someti mes no.  This went on in that pl ace, 
this went on in that part and we all 
went to work till they didn™t pay us.  
They didn™t ask us where you ma ke a living 
from and so on and so on. We  did some  
military work especially the youth.  A 
youth like me, they took me , they came in,________that means_____, that means 

biggest craft mobilization.  They came in a train.  In the train, all of a sudden, they 

gave us to do.  In the train, staying on 
the rails,          (End of Side A) 
  

 But they were not finished so I was a br
icklayer, ma urer, they 
call it and I fi nished 
inside with the me isters, the way you would describe in Germany.  They used to 

live there.  Next to those block, the 
empty ground, we made a camp.  They said 
it™s for Italian prisoners.  Th
is is the blocks, nice blocks
.  Here, for instance, in a 
camp, they™re working.  Is in Israel but I wanted to show you those 21 boys, there 

are some  pictures of them.  Here it is 
a picture, they builded a home, our own 
home  in Israel.  It™s right by the beach.  
Whoever come s, we get together; we pray 
there and one is empty wall.  All the na
me s they -- is honored.  Cost us plenty 
money, we paid for it and we ma de it.  This
 is like, this is the synagogue from our 
home town.  We want it in English becau
se the second generation.  They didn™t 
agree with us and now it™s a lot of money and 
this and that.  This 
is like a street in 
Krasnik.  I™m looking for those, ah, me mo
ries, me mories.  See, this is the 
synagogue.  See what they had there, horses. 
 

Q: Put horses in the synagogue? 

 

A: When the Germans came in, yeah.  Then 
it was the ghetto and this is -- inside so 
beautiful, painted and everything.  Twenty
-one boys.  While we were going, one 
tree, there was a lot of fore
st around.  There were partis
ans, if you read the story 
ma ybe, or you™re familiar with the Monuk, Trawniki? 
 

Q: Oh,yeah. 

 

A: That Trawniki wasn™t far from us. 

 

Q: Oh, really?  Okay. 

 
 
13
 
A: Our region.  Trawniki po
inted us to_______.  There is 
a big story to tell about 
that.  We  wa nted to go home  already. 
 There were partisans around in the big 
forest.  We  had a few incidents.  All of
 a sudden there is a shooting and the bushes 
are burning.  It™s an unusua
l thing.  We ran into the camp, there was no appell, 
nothing, that caused a panic.  Every ni
ght when we came home, counting, an 
appell; some body had to be punished or 
whatsoever.  We  read the story, good, 
good, he will forget.  That SOB didn™t forg
et.  The next day, yeah, where is that 
swine that he ran away from me ?  Anyway, we were discussing, me  and uncle and 

some  friends around, if he cal
ls you, no.  We  decided, if 
he calls you, first of all 
when he calls you,______.  Whatever he say, 
yessir, yessir, yessir.  Don™t say 
nothing else.  I wanted to go for him.  
He says no, I go.  He went out, stood like 
this,_____ Jew swine, you dog.  No, first he says, where were you?   He says and 

we made up with that  me ister, with that 
German in case he asks to say the same  
thing. He gave him a deal, so you should say that I was calling you and you didn™t 

hear him.  In case they ask me, I will say the same thing.  They were civilians 

from Yugosl a v; they were like Germans,
 they brought them and they were our 
ma sters.  We worked together and so on and so on.  But they were on the free; 

they had living conditions and so we ma de up like this.  When he went off and--- 

Where were you?   So he said, ______ you know
 the title.  I™m sorry I didn™t hear 
you, my ma ster called me -- that means th
e me ister -- he always had that machine 
carbine  and a whip with end, a weight .  
You swine, he says, when I am calling 

you, nobody™s g--d-- business, you have to come  to me .  Everybody was looking 

in his hands, what he™s taking, either the 
machine, carbine or the whip.  He took 
the whip.  Give him like this over the head._____ that means disappear.  He had 

here, after the war in Germany, when liber
ated, a German big doctor told him to 
remove it because that might take can
cer.  I ha ve here also, you see?   
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: But I was tested, it™s nothing.  That is
 an appeal.   That™s a story that _______. 
 

Q:P That happened in ™43, though? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: That happened in ™43?   That happened in Krasnik? 

 

A: No, that happened already in the ca
mp because 1942 was Judenrein, that means 
clean.  Nobody™s under fr ee and that happe
ned in the _____.  Here, also, they™re 
fixing the fence in Krasni k camp.  Where th
ey got those pictures, I don™t know.  
Here, you see a horse and wagon and the d
ead people they put 
in there and _____  
 

Q: 1942, do you reme mber when in 1942? 

 

A: Around September, yes. 

 
 
14
 
Q: Whathappened? 

 

A: It happened like this.  We were at wor
k.  The wome n and the children were like in 
the ghetto.  The ghetto was around the syna
gogue.  It wasn™t fenced, you can call 
it a ghetto. 
 

Q: Was there some  sort of barrier
?   So you couldn™t get out or---? 
 

A: No, you could get out but where could 
you go?   If you go outside the ghetto, the 
Polak will catch you and bring you to the Gestapo.  Then they going to shoot you 

because you did some thing wrong.  So there were the children, the wome n and the 

non-working people.  Otherwise, everybody 
was, whether in this place working; 

they were in three places working, which 
after that they were
 camps.  Nat urally, 
you ask me  question, how did we live, from
 what?   We  had counts for provision.  
One evening I come home from work -- ye
s, so they going to give Judenkarde, 
that means a ﬁJﬂ.  A J that means Juden. 
 Whoever get the J card is legal.  Who 

will get those J cards?  My mother-in-law if I would have it, only a wife and thst™s 

it.  So whether it belonged to my grandmother, nowhere.  We  were hiding her, in 

a baseme nt.  We  brought her down to eat, 
within the ghetto.  One evening I come  
home  for work, I says to my
 aunt, to uncle™s wife, give me  the soup, I™ll go down 
to Grandmother and give it.  She says I gave her already.  What do you mean, you 

gave her.  I want to go and see her.  D
on™t go.  I says no.  Then she revealed to 
me , they took her away.  All 
those that they didn™t have
 the J-card, that means the 
work-card, they took them away.  Where th
ey took them awa y, there is a town, 20 
kilome ters, a little, l
ittle town.  So they took them 
there.  There is less publicity 
and from there the station four kilometers
, and from there, it™s gone.  But in the 
same  ti me , when they took them, s o me th
ing was with the partisans, a shooting 
and a lot in the mi ddle of the road.  What
™s the difference, this way or the other 

way, they got killed or so
me thing, bombing, gone.  Now re mains all the legalized 
people and all the working people and we 
are working.  From Friday morning, it 
was Friday morning, yeah I think.  Friday 
morning, that all those up that have the 
Jew card, they legalized; they have to go to
 the public bath.  The public bath was 
a Jewish bath, for religious purposes, fo
rv cleaning purposes, the bude, the bath.  
The Jewish, they have to, it was for all ki
nd of purposes.  Usually it is a Friday. 
was working because for the Saturday; all 
those people have to go that have the 
Jew card and clean themselves and so on a
nd ther e they will get the real  card and 
legalize. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: It was the Jewish comma ndant of 
the town, his name  was Piza_____.  He knew 
everything before.  Like if
 he knew some thing before, 
he gave a signal to his 
fa mily and so it spread a little bit.  
He, even didn™t know. Friday morning, they 
took them all to the bath.  The mi nute they 
took them to the bath , after they were 
inside, they supplied horse and wagons, th
ey called it a ____.  When they came 

 
 
15
out from bat h______comes around and says, 
they put him and also _____ out of 
that town.  We ca me  home Friday from work, nobody™s there.  That means it™s 

Judenrein, that means clean of Jews.  That was 1942 in September.  From there it 

started.  My uncle they took to Budz
yn, me  they took to that ___________ what I 
said and that™s it.  If you rema ined in th
e city, that means the 
shtot came, the shtetl 
came. 
 

Q: So you went to this camp now? 

 

A; They took me to that camp. 

 

Q: How fa r fr om the city wa s it? 

 

A: That was like, I would say, two kilome
ters.  That camp where uncle was, Budzyn, 
was like four kilome ters.  After two week
s like or three weeks,
 they took thirty-
five people which I was in the 35 and they 
brought me  to Budzyn, to Uncle.  They 
made a selection themselves.  When I  came into that camp, was a happy day, a 

black day.  105 people that 
day, the mi nute they went out
 to work, they se lect ed 
and there was the grave.  What I tell y
ou they took from the -- they shoot 105 
people by the grave --that day I came  to Budzyn. My uncle saw me  and ---.  Since 

then, ™42, they were in Budzyn.  So I woul
d like to say we went to the camp, to 
the camp was -- from the barracks, the camp, to the werk which they called in 

German, the werk, that mean the place where we working, all those me n and 

everything was like four kilome ters.  
But in the colony where you see those 

buildings, where those Yugoslavia-German 
lived, there, all of a sudden I became 
a brickl ayer.  So life fiest what was the 
fiest on those blocks.  The kitchen wasn™t 
like here, it was a brick.  They came from
 Yugosl a via and they lived there.  We  
went ahead_____ and we lived there.  Th
at was like ten mi nutes to the camp 
which I told you the story with those bushe
s were burning.  We were there and the 
Ukrainian we re our guards.  It was hell. 
 

Q: Can you describe the town for me  a lit
tle -- not the town, I™
m sorry, the camp for 
me a little bit? 
 

A: Budzyn. 

 

Q: Yeah.  What it looked like?
  Wa s it fenced in or ---? 
 

A: It was like those barracks, you saw t
hose barracks.  No windows, nothing.  You 
saw more or less ---. 
 

Q: Was the camp fenced in? 

 

A: Fenced, double-fenced, with an electric fence. 

 

Q: It had an electric wire? 

 
 
16
 
A: Electric wire and guards around day and 
night.  Whoever didn™t want to live no 
more, he went to the wire.  Either the wi
re killed him or the guard killed him.  The 
Ukrainians were the guards but beside th
e Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer , the SS 
ma n, that Fiess and he has his helper a
nd a few officers but they were with the 
guards.  Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp .  They 

were allowed their duty, not 
in the camp.  You as k me  
a question, what did they 
have a business to go in the camp?   there 
was a lot of business.  For instance, you 
came home -- we had a stock market, as I to
ld you, we had bargain of this.  They 
didn™t have too much to eat so they, from
 the guard, they came in, not all of them, 
whoever was duty-free and they was l
ooking by us.  Or some times, when we 
came in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out.  In the boot, this they were 

allowed and to strip you and to look.  
Sometimes you find mo ney also.  Anything 
you were not allowed you could find, otherwis
e, we were not able to survive and 
so on and so on.  In 1943, when it was the Wa rsaw uprising and the rest of the 

people, they brought to Treblinka.  Why 
I me ntioned this?  it™s a connection.  
From Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to
 us, to Budzyn in that camp.  Eight 
hundred people, well-dressed,_______ they br
ought them to us, 800.  When they 
brought them to us, so the Ukrainian______ I™m an old calhoon but those arte the 

new ones and they knew, the Germans didn™
t know so much as
 the Ukrainians, 
they knew that they have money and so on and so on.  Going in from work,_____, 

that™s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled hi
m out, stripped him --they stripped once 
my uncle also.  They came  in, in the barra
cks.  Once, if the la
gerfuhrer, that Fiess 
or his helper, adjutant, came  in and saw 
in the guard.  And the guard said, this 

one, where are they?  Right away you gua
rd, you are not allowed to do that Œ 
shoot him.  So they were sleeping, thos
e var_____people and th
is and that.  Many 
came over to me, they say this all the tim
e, I™m a n honest guy and so on.  Abie, do 
me  a favor.  Here™s 5, 600 zlotys, hide
 them.  Wh ere did you hide them?   At 
wotrk.  If tomorrow you didn™t go there, 
-- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian.  
He was a year older than I am.  I remember his name , Ger man, which he was my 

ma ster, I worked for him.  I had to____________.  I had a hiding____, he knew.  I 

didn™t tell him exactly and I had the ke
y.  There we re no honest people, listen, 

when it comes to a piece of bread, it™s a 
different story.  But they saw the honesty 
in me , this one gave me  800 zlotys, this 
one gave me  500, to hide it every time.  
They give me and I had it on the top, on 
the attic in the sand.  Once I came there 
and it was dry there, nothing there.  
Some body looked, they see what I™m doing, 
can™t say a word, you got to keep your m
outh s hut because --.  That™s the way 
when the Russian people came to us and 
they were________.  They told us stories 
from Treblinka and so on and so on.  Then
 they decided to liq
uuidate that camp.  
Before that liquidation of the camp, all of
 a sudden, there was typhus.  There was 
no water.  That was, I think, in ™43.  
There is typhus.  Are you surprised?   
Whoever was sick, there were both Œ the st
omach typhuses and there is a planastic 
like a rash from.  I had both.  Whoever si
ck, they took one barrack and there they 
put the people.  Every morning that Fiess 
came in before breakfast.  We  called his 
machine gun, this hunsagle.  What is a huns
agle, we always called it, he shouldn™t 
understand because a lot of Jewish is lik
e German.  Hunsagle means like hands-up 

 
 
17
and that carbine, machine carbine looked like 
it.  He™s going already with the --.  
Every morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the 
barrack and running.  Beside
s this, there wasn™t thos
e blocks, those blocks you 
saw.  Was block 2, outside from the fence,
 right across the street.  There was that 
block and in that block was a lazarett.  
It means a hospital.  If you was sick, they 
took you there.  It was like, it was -- in
 camp was  tailor place, shoemaker place, it 
was for us.  But in that block was for the SS.  Some  people were there and there 

was a lazarett also.  Other times, he took out
 and he shoot.  He was already in the 
typhus.  But listen, he was a ma n of 35 
at that time, 38, a strong guy.  He could 
ma ke it.  I was a little kid 18 years old.  But we didn™t go that far, we worked in 

the colony so it was like ten mi nutes from 
the camp.  Every day I want to work.  I 
went to work.  I dsat down, I sit.  I 
couldn™t do nothing.  That guy, Brumula, what 
is the hell the ma tter with you?   I said, k
eep your mouth shut.  I was returned like 
this.  He only pray to God he should be an SS ma n and I should be in his camp.  I 

said you shouldn™t live to that.  His fa ther 
was one foot shorter and he wass in the 
werk there and he was an SOB.  He br
ought me  to eat from his house.  If he 
should know that, he should spend with me  
again.  It was Œ (fe male voice: it was 
life or death every mi nute).  So you go into 
a story.  I could not survive to stay in 
camp, it™s the death.  If I would have to 
go the three, four kilometers to the 
barrack, but here ---.  We  had the obermei
ster, that was the head supervisor from 
the milers.  He was so short, Schultz, a 
German from Ostowiec.  He had here an 
STP National Organization with the 
H_____.  He was a good guy, they were 
good_______.  Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but 

fortunately I have to say the truth.  He  come s in, hey Morris to him.  Wha t  is with 

your son Brumula.  If he™s sick, he has t
p.  He said to me , me ister Schultz, sh --, 
sh --.  No he has to stay in the lazarett.  That means the hospital.  Come s over to 
me , how you feel?   I feel all right.  
You don™t be ask me , you don™t feel right.  
You got to stay in the hospital.  You were
 not allowed to tell 
outside what is going 
on inside.  If they found out, so you know what
 is the result, what the verdict is.  
But whoever wanted to fi nd out some thing, he found out.  One day he come s over 
to me,  tell you that time I was as tall 
as him.  I know already what™s going on 
here.  I keep my mouth shut.  You™re af
raid to go because Fiess every time  he 
shoots, you™re dead.  I don™t say a word. 
 That™s an interes
ting story.  I know 
already what to do.  I don™t answer nothing.  Wh at is he going to do but ---.  I says 

I™m going, kill, ki ll me , what™s the di fferenc
e?   He went over to that Fiess and he 

told me ,______ and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice.  Hey, listen, I have by 

me  such a good faulker and so on and so on 
but he™s thinking he
 needs a lazarett.  
So let him go in.  He says sh, sh.  I won™
t guarantee, not in th
at barrack.  I want 
him in the lazarett.  That™s the way he to
ld me  the story.  I didn™t hear.  You stay 

tomorrow in lager and you will go to the 
lazarett and don™t be 
afraid of nothing.  
Tomorrow they took me  into that block 2, to
 that lazarett.  Than that block 2 in 

lazarett in this bed was laying a ma n probabl
y I have in the pictur
e, that his sister, 
like that Stochman was from the men, the 
leader, his sister was from the wome n.  
Her brother was laying in one bed with so
me thing I sign here.  They put me  next 
to his bed and they also put me  in so
me thing like 00 I don™t reme mber what it 
was, a sign.  He, as he went to that ca
mp in, how far was it?  Across the street 

 
 
18
from his location to run around to those pe
ople.  Then he went to him to the 
lazarett in block 2 also.  He come s i
n, he looks around and he goes away.  he 
wanted, usually from there, they didn™t
 take out.  One day, I don™t know that but 
that™s what they told me , I was in the high fever.  You have high fever, you 

shouldn™t know from it, and you don™t know where you stand.  Let™s say every 

morning he came in high bush, v_______ how 
you feelo?   Went away.  He saw 
him going away already, thank God, but I wa
s in very high fever.  He came in and 
he asked some thing.  Instead to say some
thing, I swing with my arm.  I don™t 
know, till today I don™t believe it but the next  door man, whe n he get out, he said 

to my Uncle Morris, you know what your 
Brumula did?   I don™t know of nothing.  
When I swung like this, of course I didn™t 
hit him, he said (female voice: he was 
delirious) in German, like the gendarme in Ger man, du_______, that me ans you 

dog, a swine is like a pig, you had luck.  If
 not for this, I don™t know of nothing.  I 
can™t say nothing.  I don™t want even to
 put in the record
 because ----.  
 

Q: You don™t reme mber it? 

 

A: (He was delirious, he had periodic deliri
um)  That™s what they said.  You get out 
from the sickness, they give you three, f
our weeks, you can stay in the camp.  A 
big deal, you can stay in the camp.  Ev
erybody wants to get out from the  camp.  
The next day I™m going to work.  He sees me
, he yells at me .  I didn™t answer.  He 
went through 14 days with it.   I stood a
nd I worked, that™s all.  The same  story, 
when it came that typhus and everything, 
Trawniki, what I me ntioned, there is 
Pl_______ another camp  like this.  We work
ed for Henklewerk.  Henklewerk is a 

big air/space ----. 
 
Q: German company, right? 
 

A: They, I don™t know for who they worked.  One Sunday, and we heard about 
Pl_______, Trawniki, that they burned the camp because of the typhus, to the 

ground.  One Sunday, that was in ™43, yea
h, one Sunday, we are not going out to 
work.  The guards like double or triple d who knows.  There is standing already 

little pumps with gasoline to do us the same  thing.  People want already to jump 

on the wires.  They say I rather get killed 
from the wire that he should kill me .  
All of a sudden, stop.  What is the stop?   
That Fiess, that la
gerfuhrer, he didn™t 
want to lose his post.  As I me ntioned, because where is he  going to go.  In the 

front, nobody want to go Œ all patriots up front.  He™s some thing, had a 

conversation with Lublin with Henklew
erk there and Henklewerk stopped it.  

They called to Germany, to the headquart
ers whatever that is.  I don™t Know thE 
Story goes.  The story ends that they 
stopped, they took away everything and they 
didn™t burn us. 
 

Q: When was this, do you reme mber? 

 

A: Forty-three, I think, ™43. 

 

 
 
19
Q: Late ™43, do you reme mb er? 
 

A: Iwouldn™treme mber. 

 

Q: Sometime in ™43? 

 

A: Sometime in ™43.  They didn™t and the ne
xt day as usual, as before, whoever is 
sick stays in the barracks, whoever is
 good goes to work, thanks to Henklewerk 
and that SOB Fiess.  Then in ™43, things changed it.  That was camp, things 

changed.  We  were building the ca mp in
 the barrack because  to say what will 
have to go.  There is no_______.  They pr
obably were afraid 
of the partisans 
because when we walked to work, a lot of times disappeared and so on and so on.  

They had to cross the ma in road and this
 and that.  They brought in a little town 
what they were still in that town; they
 brought them in.  so they started to 
disappear so they figured 
different.  Why here, be there.  They build another 
camp.  It became, instead of camp, becam
e KZ.  That means concentration camp.  
A lot of them have the KZ.  Instead I have 
the number.  In that time , from civil we 
changed, if it™s concentration camp, 
we had to change to the stripes. 
 

Q: You had civilian clothes on, up to this point? 

 

A: In Budzyn, yes.  Some  c i vilian clothes 
was here ma rked a KZ.  It was some thing 
and we came to the verrick which you™re familiar with what I mean the verrick.  

In the same  time, no mo re Ukrainians but SS replaced the guard, no more 

Ukrainians.  You can imagine SS and we were there.  We  were there and when it 

started more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they 
started little by little to liquidate that 
camp.  Beca use they figured and so on and 
so on.  As I said what they did there,
 they brought_______tanks, one soldier, we 
had to fix in the tanks from the Ukra
inians™ Russia, they were pigs, dead 
ones._______which we had a_______by that and so on and so on.  Then from that 

KZ ca mp which it was in the veld, every 
time  we start fight from that people to 
send some _______. 
 

Q: Oh, you started sending 
500 people out from ca mp? 
 

A: Every time, every time. 

 

Q: Did they know where they were going?
  Did anyone say where they were going? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  One was going to another sh
tetl, one wa s going to another shtetl, where 
it was a camp like this.  Finally, we are al
most the last ones.  They were sending 
to M__________, V________ which there is also
 Henklewerk and there is salt, 

where you taking out salt from the ground.  
There they got the KZ.  It remains 
like the last groups.  My uncle knew a li
ttle bit that Stochland so he always 
begged him;  written in camp, was like a 
Jewish shtetl let™s say.  We  had our 
police, we had our leaders.  Let™s say I 
had a complaint from you.  I went in and I 

 
 
20
complained to______. In the nice Jewish way that ultimately they should know 
from it.  So my uncle talked with that
 Stochland; I would 
like to go where you go.  
Besides this, if not, I would like you shoul
d not separate us, you should know it™s 
a father and son.  It came before the la
st group to go where?  To Majdanek.  He 
said to my Uncle Morris, I can™t help no more.  I wish I knew where I am going.  

So far, I don™t know.  You see, even_______which they are here, from one 

fa mily, the mother, the husband and wife a
nd two little boys; they survived all.  
How, if you want to know the story, they 
survived with my Uncle Morris.  The 
boys ma rried, children.  He was Œ that girl 
that he was going with in the camp was 
his wife™s a cousin.  They are now in Mi
nneapolis, wherever.  So he says to me , 
you see, even them, not all of them, 
but few I™m sending this_______, I can™t help 
mysrlf. 
 

Q: So now they sent you to Majdanek? 

 

A: To Majdanek.  That was in 1944, I think.  Yeah, in ™44. 

 

Q: Early™44? 

 

A: Early™44. 

 

Q: Did they send you on trains? 

 

A: No.  Wa s close ---. 

 

Q: It was close-by, it wasn™t that far away? 
 
A: It was like 50 kilome ters.  It was 
like, you know, those trucks, open trucks and 
with wires around and the guards standing 
that you shouldn™t jump around.  They 
brought us to Majdanek.  We  saw Majdane
k, we didn™t see yet.  All those guards 
and all those fields.  Majdanek, if they 
didn™t ten fields in a crematorium, t hey 
didn™t have nothing.  They brought us in 
to field one.  That was a camp set for 
every field was a different fiel
d.  In that camp, t hey took 
us out to work within the 
camp.  Nobody was there.  Across the wires,
 in another field 
we saw fellows, one 
without an arm, one without a leg, one saw.  We  didn™t know who they were but 

they started rumors, they are Russians 
from the front.  They are prisoners, 
whatever. 
 

Q: POW™ s, prisoners of war? 

 

A: Yes.  But no one, very seldom one was a 
full guy.  Next day they take us on that 
appellplatz and they started.  My uncle, 
he had broken a leg in Budzyn like two, 
three months before.  He was working by the kitchen because they gave him a 

break but that time  whe n we went to 
the work, there was no more on the calendar 
to work.  His foot wasn™t so Œ so we ge
t out on that appell. 
 It was healed, he 
wasn™t in the hospital at camp, he wa s h
ealed.  They go and they take us to 

 
 
21
Majdanek out the next day and to separa
te us where to go to work.  They call 
schneiders, tailors.  Tailors, till he got
 with me , so ma ny, he™s behind.  I didn™t 
want, I stepped out, want to be together. 
 I didn™t know it™s in the place, I thought 
ma ybe they send away.  The policy was to look that you should be inside.  As I 
said, ine fight with the hunger, with the 
weather, with the cold was ---.  But you 
tried, you push yourself.  He is behind.  
I stepped out.  They call shoema kers, he 
says where you going?   I said my uncle ther
e.  Not his father, the other guy was a 
shoema ker and a shoema ker, he is behind.  Finally that was for the SS working, 

finally they call us in.  I got in with
 hi m together because it wasn™t too ma ny 
people.  Shoema ker, shoema ker. 
 

Q: So he became a shoema ker then? 

 

A: I and him became a shoema ker, ten people.  Ten people, they brought us in a 
barrack.  That™s outside the fields. It
™s Majdanek the camp, but Majdanek had 
about ten fields.  Each field was a cam
p.  But this was also a field where the 
whole admi nistrations are.  The ma gazines with the _______ and so on.  Come s 

over a guy, here with a red triangle, red tria
ngle is politicians.  Green is like us.  
He was with a high vake.  My name  is Fr
anz, I™m an arrister.  I am from this 
ma gazine but I am a prisoner just like you, 
he said.  Arrister.  He tells me , I was 
not in touc h with Hitler, you know what that
 means?   To ki ll him, politic.  He is 
from Œ there is a few guys, you will see them, political, German, Austrian.  There 

is little tables like shoemakers™ tabl es, te
n people.  Eight by a ta
ble there, me with 
my uncle, he gives to the other table, f
our and across sitting four, those fellows.  
Those one with one arm. one --- and I know already who they are and anot her 

table there.  He comes over to me, what
 is your name ?   He says I call you 
Brumula.  It seems to me  by the Germa
n, Abraham is Brumula, Brumula, fine.  

Who is he?   I says, this is my father
.  You be the kapo he says, you know what 

means kapo.  I am the kapo but you™re going to be like the foreman of over those 

ten peoples.  Say yes.  Yes.  
I didn™t like it.  Then he 
calls me in in his magazine, 
whole ma ga zine, shoes, clothing and ever
ything.  He has the two Russians; they 
standing with picks and picking these things
.  You see what they doing?   I see.  
You know why they doing, he tells
 me .  You going to pick 
like this and the picker 
don™t go in, either bring it to me, whether it
™s a shoe or whether it™s a garment or 
rip it and see what™s there.  Chances are 
there is gold.  Do the same  thing.  I do, I 
do.  I don™t fi nd nothing.  He took me  by the co
llar and threw me  out.  Go back to 
your place there.  He brought in bread, th
is and that every morning, from where 
he got that bread or whatever, I don™t 
know.  Across the street was the ma gazine, 
there was an undersh______, a German and a
nother Ss ma n a nd there were three, 
four Polish guys, intellectuals from t he 
colleges which they were also like 

prisoners but in a different way.  They were
 working and this and that.  They kept 
records and everything.  Every morni
ng, he took a wagon, those German wagons 
and he packed hims elf in.  You could, 
you wouldn™t recognize whether he has in 
the bag that thing or in th
e front with food with everyt
hing.  He put 
clothing, dirty 
clothing and like horses,us, and we went 
to the vasherei to the washroom where 
the wome n worked.  Our wome n there from
 our townspeople.  He gave them 

 
 
22
bread, water, ma rmalade this and that enough. 
 Every day like this.  I was the -- he 
said take a few guys.  Anyway, one day he come s over to me .  He gives me  a boot 
and my uncl e  one boot.  He says Brumula 
be careful, your father too.  I need the 
upper soft -- the bottom, never mi nd.  Bu
t you can look ma ybe .  I start to pinch, it 
don™t go.  I™m getting______.  Those Russians they were already experts.  They 

saw already what -- and my uncle does it th
e same thing;  happens to him the same 
thing.  He don™t know what I am doing.  Wh
en he took out, there is a piece where 
they were laying in it.  He took the pieces
 but this part of the shoe where it was 
inside, he threw it on the floor. Those Russian
s, they were so smarter, they were 
longer than us there; he pick
ed it up.  It was their fore ma n like I was by the Jew.  
He had one arm like this; he called him over and he shows him that and he 

says_______ that means 14, 14 pieces.  I saw this, I didn™t know what to do.  I get 

up from my chair and I go into the ma
gazine and I says to him Frank, I found 
some thing here.  How much/  I took out, 
not all of them.  I ke pt by me  three 

pieced and I give it to him.  How about 
your father?   I says I don™t know.  Before 
I says I don™t know and I got back to my 
seat, that fore ma n from the Russian, he 
took down my number, it wasn™t numbers ye
t, this is in Auschwitz but we had 
here a number and the uncle, he took down those numbers and went into the 

ma gazine and told the over______ there. 
 He was a Polish-German, he spoke 
Polish what happened here.  The mi nute he come s in and he calls my uncle™s

he took everything out and he 
put it on the table.  You have no more?   No.  Those 
Polaks, those students back and they call him in.  They call him in and that Frank, 

don™t be afraid.  He didn™t ask me  if I have some thing or I don™t have some thing,
