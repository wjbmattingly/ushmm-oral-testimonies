A: Right. 
Q: Œ sometimes you have flashes, so like Œ 

A: Yeah, the only thing I rememb er of my 
father are two really crazy things, and 
one was how he washed  his hands, and how he
 dried his back. And this is Œ this is 
so weird and my  mo ther couldn™t unders
tand why I didn™t reme mb er he Œ cause he 
said he, you know, he loved me so mu ch an
d he was with me as mu ch as he could 
be, but I remembered nothing. So, the Œ th
e only thing I remember of before we 
were in 
Vienna
 was my going into a store in 
Prague
, 
Czechoslovakia
 and saying 
[speaks Czech here]
. That™s the only thing I reme
mber. So whenever I meet 
somebody Œ 
Q: And what does that mean? 
A: It actually means, can I 
have a quart of butter, or a 
[in d ecipherable]

sent me to the store for some butter. 
And th at™s the only th ing I reme mb er

any Czech, or that was the sent

then I say that and th ey sort of look at me
 and say, you want some butter? And I say 
oh, you understood wh at I said 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: That™s f u nny. Do you know w

Prague 
befo re 
going Œ why not directly to 
Vienna
? 
A: That I don™t know why Œ 
oh, I Œ yes, I do know, I do know. We stored Œ we had 
to store whatever f Œ we could bring out, wh
ich was some fur Œ lot of furniture, and 
Œ and personal papers. We
 had to  store them in
 Prague
. And I don™t know why we 
had to store them in 
Prague
, but we did. And they were
 stored there all during the 
war, and when I was in 
England
 already, and my  mo ther was too, she paid for 
storage, all during th e war she kept up th

A: It was still being stored. And in 1946,when my mother wrote to Œ to bring it 
over, they  wrote back  and said it™s not th
ere anymore. The Œ you know, first it was 
the Nazis and then it was the Russians. And 
they had no idea wh
at happened to it, 
so Œ there was a lot of Œ all 
our personal stuff was there.

a big house back in

A: No id ea. I wrote afterwards, I wrote to the comp any. Was a big Œ it™s a big 

moving company. I wrote to them and I researched it, I 
Googled

Q: So when he arrived he 
was already very sick and Œ 
A: Well, he really Œ he was a very strong man, he was very sporty. He was an 

amateur soccer player for

about the family from Œ 
A: Well, this person wrote a biography, and 
in fact, I was just reading through it, I 
was trying to  find something about my  fath
er. But it™s not a lot. What he said was 
that there was a split in the 
family between those that 
had some money, and those 
that didn™t have money. The ones that didn
™t have money were sort of artists. A rtists 
kind of were black sheep of the family, a

Vienna
 trying to sell it. A nd I think

 excuse me. 
Q: No problem. 

A: The things I remember from 
Vienna
 are not happy memories. T h ey™re probably 
the worst memories I h ave of the war. And 
that™s why it™s so ironic that my father 
said we should go to 
Vienna
 because it™ll be safer in 
Vienna

And I Œ I™ve tried to research that, I wrote

out Œ cause you did spend like Œ it was two 
years, you came in ™36 and there was ™38, so Œ 
A: I think yeah Œ I think probably my  lack 
of memory there is due to the fact that 
we moved from 
Berlin
 to 
Czechoslovakia
. This is, you know, as a six year old 
child, or a seven year old child
 at that time. And th en my father died, and then , you 
know, we were Œ I was pretty much alone in

they had a boy an d a girl 
who were probab ly Œ I was 
eight, 18 Œ who were probably 
12 years older than I was. 
And Œ and I Œ we kept in

I remember, was n-not
 locked Œ sealed.

mo ther talking with me about what was 
going on. I-I think sh e was probably in such
 a psychological tu

know whether she was even ab

have had Œ it™s ve

thing that was going on. I just remember 
turmoil, you know, dreadful turmoil. But 
because we were not religious, and I never 
went to temp le, I don™t know if Œ how I probab

 that to religion, I

David

then? You couldn™t go to scho

did you do? 
A: Well, that was spring of ™3 8, and I don™t know. I know I 
Œ I was in the store, this 
Œ this tie shop down  below, with  these frien
ds of ours. I know I was in the store a 
lot. So I think I probably Œ that™s how I 
spent my days, with th em, while my mother 
was trying to  sell her leather flowers.  

Q: And did she manage to sell Œ 
A: Yeah, she Œ she became, I gather, I 
say she was a perfectionist, she became 
really good at that. And sh
e took that hobby, by then, to 
England
 with her and 
continued making leather flowers over there.

just lost my  father, and Œ and having no

what she was doing, the flowers, apparently
 had to make up her mind within , I think 
it was 13 days, 12 days, whether to send me on a

was crying Œ or, a lot of people were cr

 brave little kid, suppressing everything, I

Q: Did your mo ther cry? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t remember. And qu ite honestly, we never really talked 

about it. You know, there was 
so much that wasn™t talked  about. On e of the things

And my  mo ther, of course, had lived all her

ily was sort of ostracized by th e people

of the Japanese, and was very mistreated. 
So they, you know, th
ey  were angry at 
Walter
 for being a conscientious objector, and 
of course everything that came with 
Walter
, which was me. But 
Jessie™s
(ph) family, certainly, yes. All her family 
accepted me. I Œ I guess I just figured I was 
one of the family. 
And then when my 
mother came over, she lived with us for qu
ite a while. And she to
ok on a new inco Œ 
wa-way of making inco me, she studied  hair
dressing with a French  hairdresser in 
town . And in her way, she beca Œ became be
tter than he was, so people wanted her, 
not him. So, I Œ actually, it was fine with 
him, he Œ he didn™t mind, as long as she 
was getting lots of customers. And then on e day my mother thought that maybe she 
could do this on her own and 
not be wo rkin g for him. So I think she gave indication 
that she may leave, and he didn™t want 
her to leave. So he said he would do 
anything she should stay there. So she sa
id, okay, I™ll stay if you provide me with 

cigarettes. Cause at this time cigarettes were
 Œ were rationed. A
nd he actually went 
out and kept her supplied with Œ sh
e hadn™t smoked befo re she came to 
England
, 
but it™s a habit she started, she started ch
ain-smoking. And he kept her supplied with 
cigarettes. And eventually sh
e had her own busin ess, but Œ

A: I Œ I don™t th Œ I don™t reme Œ rememb
er an y struggle betw
een the two of them 
for Œ for me. My mother was too busy, y
ou know, wo rking. And she did everything 
she could to pay back  what they  were giving to Œ sh e would stay up all night to 
make Œ she would do embroide
ry. Embroider pillow Œ cush
ion covers for birthdays 
and Christmas and that sort of thing fo r 
the family. And so Œ I mean, actually my 
foster mother died in
 my mother™s arms. So it was Œ 
they were Œ they became very 
close, they became best friends almost. It 
was a Œ it™s Œ that™s sort of a very nice 
story. 
Q: That is a very nice story. 

A: Really, it Œ yeah, it Œ it™s a very nice story. 
Q: So how long did 
you stay with them? 
A: I was at the s Œ Quaker boarding school
 til ™47. I think it wa
s about til f Œ I w ould 
come home for holid ays, vacations, til about 
fi Œ til the end of the war, maybe. Til 
™45, and then my  mo ther got her own pl
ace, and then we 
lived in the town. 
Q: In 
Yo rk
? 
A: In 
Yo rk

being turned  into a Œ a Œ a hotel. Th
e people who bought my  mo ther™s house, 
bought the two houses on e
ither side, it was sort of 
terraced housing, and broke 
through, and it™s now a fairly big hotel. And I 
Googled

I can get it any time. I

now converted into Œ it™s strange. 
Q: Do you reme mb er ho
w the war ended in  Œ 
A: How it ended, yes, I reme mb er 
Churchill™s 
speech, hearing it on the radio. I was 
actually at board ing school. My  birthday is on 
V-E Day
, which is Œ you know what 
V-E Day 
is, yeah? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Maybe that™s why I™ve been so lucky, cause I was born on Mo ther™s day and my  

birthday was 
V-E Day
. Yeah, I Œ I remember that, I 
remember all the celebrations, 
and Œ 

Q: And what about 
your relatives in 
Berlin
? It was your mother™s mother? 
A: My mother™s mother died
 in theres Œ no, not in 
Theresienstadt
. She was in 
Theresienstadt
. I™m Œ I again have a package of letters from my  grandmother, on Œ 
Q: To your mother? 

A: To my mother. On paper that is lik
e tissue paper almost, you know, it™s Œ it™s 
airmail, and it™s in the old German handwriti
ng. I can read it. My mother never read 
it, ne-never read any of her 
letters, she wasn™t able to.

A: She couldn™t get herself to read anythi
ng from my  grandmother. She had all this 
guilt about leaving her there, and Œ 
Q: So, would you read the letters? 
A: I have read Œ yeah , I have gone through 
them. I can read most of it, not all of it. 
Q: But did you read them at
 the time when you were 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, I read them after 
Œ my  mo ther, you know, after she died, I Œ I got all this 
stuff. 

Q: So you didn™t even kn
ow what was going on? At th
e time when she was writing, 
your mo ther was not reading them? 
A: Well, the last letter was when she ha
d gone to an old age home. They  had 
gathered all the old people Œ old? She wa
s 66. They  had gathered all the elderly 
people, and the last letters 
from there, that she was there, and she was happy, and 
everything was fine, I mean, there™s a lot 
of cover up. And how were we, and she 

hoped we™d be fine. And they
 were going on a journey, th
ey were going to  be taken 
somewhere else, which was to 
Theresienstadt
. And then from 
Theresienstadt
, 
again from my research, I un
derstand she was sent to 
Minsk
, and died there at 
Minsk
. And I have a co uple of different repor
ts. One is that she was in a Œ one of 
the cattle cars, and they were shunted asid
e, I guess left there, and the people just 

died of starvation and Œ and cold . The ot
her was that she went to the ghetto in

Minsk
, and that again there was starvation 
[ina udible]
. And I ne Œ I never told  my  
Œ I never told my  mo ther. I had done some
 research before she died, but she was 
under the impression she d Œ her mo ther died in 
Theresienstadt
, which was not 
quite as bad as some of the other pla
ces. And I never told  her anything about 
Minsk
. And it turns out that my husba
nd™s grandmother was also in 
Theresienstadt
 
at the same time as my grandmother. So we 
keep saying, I wonder
 if they ever met 
each other? 

Q: Yeah. So, I just want to clear somethin
g. So your mother was re Œ she was not 
reading the letters as th ey were being sent, 
or you™re saying sh e di
d not want to read 
them after the war? Did you know what 
was going on with your grandmother when  

the wa-war was still going on? Do you reme
mber your mother talking about it? 
A: I certainly did not know wh at was going on. 
[break] 
A: Œ no memo ry of ever knowin g what 
Œ what was happening to my  grandmother, 
until after the war, I had no idea. And I Œ I 
don™t think my mother
 knew, either. And 
I don™t think Œ I don™t think she read her 
letters, I don™t know. Sh e always told  me 
that she had these bundle of letters, that 
she can™t get herself to read them. Now, 
whether it was re-read, that™s possible t
oo, I don™t know. But my  mo ther Œ you 
know, I told you that sh
e didn™t deal with my father™s 
death, she wasn™t able to talk

about that, she was never able
 to talk about her Œ her mother, and it was just a Œ a 
series of su ppressions that she had. 
Q: Were there ar Œ other relatives? 
A: Oh, all my  grandmother™s Œ there were
 Œ there were Œ how many of them were 
there? Seven. Seven siblings. One came to 
America
, to San Fran cis Œ to 
Lo s

Q: What™s her name? 

A: That was 
Feidelberg

Feidelbergs
(ph). He survived. Four of the sisters 
died in th e concen tration camp s. Two of 
th e children of those sisters died. One was 
a really, really young, ju st four or five years old, died. 

Q: And you knew them all from 
B erlin
? Do you rememb er any of them?

A: I don™t really Œ I don™t really remember th em, no. My mother knew them and she 
talked about them very often, but Œ 
Q: And so you learned a

and he was the one actually, who brought me 
into the wo rld. And he Œ he wa Œ he

of the sister s.  
Q: It™s okay. 
A: It™s in my book. Sometimes I have to go
 to my book to remember names. O n e of 
the Nazis had a child that was very sick, so
 they came to him to
 help the child. And 
the child was so sick that 
the uncle did not want to wo rk on him, because he knew 
that if the child died , he would be blamed fo
r it. So he said he didn™t want to take it 
on, the child was sick. So, 
by doing that, they Œ of co
urse they sent him to
