they would break the door and come  in 
with dogs, and take you to the grave.

A: Mass grave. And we didn™t know what was goi
ng on, so my dad grabbed us, the children, and 
we ran upstairs in the attic. And we had a ladder,
 and he pulled the ladder. So if you don™t have 

the ladder, you can™t climb to the attic. And 
-- and they came in and 
they didn™t see nobody, and 
they went out, with dogs, with -- they we -- with
 -- before they did this 
they were drunk. They --

they were drinking a day before. So they were screaming, yelling, raus Jude . And we stayed 
there for about three or four hours, and it calm 
down, and we went down and we found out what 
was going on. And if you survived after so ma ny
 hours, they took you to the ghetto. We had a 
ghetto in Koretz. And -- and that™s it.

kinderloch, run, because so and so and whatever. So 
my parents heard that and they -- they had a 
Ukraine family that they had 
no children, and they said -- my
 parents gave them mone y, gold, 
and whatever, jewelry, and they promised that 
they gonna save me  and my older brother. And 
my mother and dad said that we should go ther
e. And I said, no, I™m not going. If they going to 
kill you, I™m not going. I™m staying here. And well, wh
en my mother said something like that, I 
ignored her, but when the da -- 
when my dad said some thing, it 
meant business. And she started 
to pack for me  that we are leaving. And I sa
ys, if I go, I am not taking nothing, and I™m not 
going. And they said, no, we ma de arrangeme nt

it got dark, it got maybe 
eight o™clock, nine o™clock, I™m not sure, and 
we ran out from the ghe
tto. The ghetto was not 
wired, you can go. And we heard shooting. Somebody was shooting, and we hid under a bush. 

And then there was a -- I reme mber, was a -- like
 a -- not a -- pond, or what, and you had to cross 
that in order to run away, and we jumped over th
ere, and I was 10 years old, 11 years old, I didn't  
know how to swim, and my brother pulled me  out by my hair, and we -- he was a -- a ma n, a 

boy, and he stronger than I am, he knew how to swim, and he saved me . And we ran over that 

water, or whatever, I di -- I 
can™t tell you what it was. And we
 were hiding under that bush. And 
we went, we ran. It took us more 
than an hour, two hours to get to th
at -- to those people. And we 
came and it was already 10 o™clock. We knocked in
 the door, and we said, we came to you, and 
we didn™t say nothing, killing or  whatever. And sh
e said, oh my God, oh my God. And she said -
- we said, we  like to stay here for a day or 
two. And she says, oh, okay, then you can go in the 
barn and hi -- and sleep there.
 And we did. And in the morning she came, and she says, I heard 
that they killed already, everybody in Koretz. It™s
 -- everybody™s killed. And -- and we started to 
cry, and we knew that that™s it, 
they killed our parents and the 
two brothers. And every morning

eave because they gonna find out that she is hiding 
Jews, then they gonna kill he r. And that was ev
ery morning. And she would bring us a piece of 
bread and a glass of milk. And anyway, I told my 
brother, I™m leaving. I can™t stay here. And he 
says, well, there™s nothing we can do. And I wa 
-- in the morning, I got up, and I says, I™m going. 
Because she would come in and she said we mus t  leave. And I said good-bye and I walk out 

from that barn, and I didn™t know where to go, be
cause we were border with Russia, and that was
