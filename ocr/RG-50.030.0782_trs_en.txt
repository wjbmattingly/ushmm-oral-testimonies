Q: Before we get into all 
of the difficult times of the war years, I™m going to  ask a 
number of questions about wh at your life was 
like in pre-wars years; and the idea is 
to get a sense of the world you were bor
n in to, the people that you knew, who you 
were close to; so that when
 the war comes we can understand how th ings changed, 
and what was lost. So my first question is th
e very basic: can you tell me  the date of 
your birth? 
A: June 15, 1919.

 in 
Poland

ere is this place, the village?

Poland
 now, close to border with 
Ukrain e

 the territory of today™s 
Poland

bout two years before Œ two years maybe t

cau s e w h en  w e  came, 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
15
I just happened ba Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 run into him. And we
 have a long talk, he 
asked point blank what happen
ed, because in Œ bishop, they
 tell him that this Œ that 
this vil Œ village is qu-quite communist, 
ma ny co mmunists, which was not true. It 
was one. But the predecessor, well, that 
was local problems. There was a Œ the 
peasant party, and a 
youth organization, 
wici
(ph), wh ich was quite
 radical. And the 
organizer of the 
wici
(ph) became communist. He had some friends in 
France
, and 
they tend to be communists in 
France
, and they send him some literature Œ 
Q: And he was influenced? 
A: And he be Œ got influenc
ed, so he became communist. But then Œ and that was 
the reason the government ca Œ the co
unty office closed the Œ the local 
wi ci
(ph) 
organization 

Q: The youth organization. 

A: Yeah. And so  they got somebody else on 
his place, and so  he was not influential, 
this guy in the village, rea
lly, but that is what happen
ed. And 1935, I believe, there 
was a problem in the village, because the Œ 
the landlord had lot of
 land, and he need 
Œ and not much machinery. He had already 
some mach inery, but a lot of work was 
done by hand, by people. 
So he pay from about a 
zlo t y
 a day, with  a Œ with Œ on 
your own food. So , only a 
zlo t y
 a day. 
Q: So th at™s considered not a lot of money. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
16
A: There was not a lot of money Œ well, th at was a lot of money, but not enough, 
you know. Food would cost mo re than 
zlo t y
 a day, you know. 
Q: Okay , so Œ 
A: Œ or at least 
zlo t y
 for food, yeah. 
Q: Okay , so somebody who would wo rk his land Œ 
A: So th e youth, this organization, 
although was formally disbanded by the 
government, but they still existed, and th
ey have Œ they have
 library, and even 
[indecipherable]
 them, because they as
k me what kind of bo
ok to buy, and they 
have some eve Œ may Œ even  some to Œ corre
ct money for thing. So they decided to 
strike. Well, strike, and here is
 time of harvest, you know Œ 
Q: In the summer. 

A: And he need the people to take care of
 the Œ and the priest, previous one, on the 
Œ in the church, stated that cris Œ Chri
st said muts Œ pray  and work  and pray , 
something like that. And so, it is cri Œ it is 
sin to destroy, to Œ to do harvest, you 
know, God™s whatever. 

Q: Food. 

A: Yeah. And so  Œ and when  he said that
 from the altar, the young people walk out 
of the church, you know. 

Q: Oh ho. Oh ho. Yeah. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
17
A: So that became the story that it is 
communist, you know. So, they were not 
communist, but they  just didn™t like it, and 
when the new priest came, and I Œ as I 
said, I just hap Œ by accident 
I ran into Œ to  him, about first or second day wh en we 
came, before he even has Œ has a first mass 
in church. So we talk, and I tell him all 
about. So  he change Œ so he 
knew how to handle himself. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I was Œ that was ki Œ at the end of
 vacation, wh en I was Œ not vacation, but 
Œ yeah , in summer, before it™s Œ the school 
started. And so I went to school, to 
Przemy
˚
l
, and by return for east Œ for Christmas, 
I walk with my father at night, the 
night Œ midnight Œ 

Q: Mass? 
A: Œ mass. 

Q: Mm-hm, at Christmastime, yeah. 

A: For Christma s Œ cris Œ the na Œ eve. 
And so we walk  on from the priest™s Œ 
priest™s house, p-priest walk with
 one of the leaders of this Œ 

Q: Strike. 

A: Œ youth organization. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So I se Œ I said to her Œ 
my father, oh-oh, it looks good. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

18
Q: Yeah. 
A: And really, when we get there, all th
e yo-young people were there, singing, you 

know, carols and so on. So it was very 
Œ everything went back to normal. 
Q: Was your family political at all? 

A: Well, my father belonged to this
 peasant party you 
know. This was Œ 
Q: This was Œ was this Œ 

A: But he was not very activ
e, or Œ he just belonged. 
Q: So Œ but the peasant party, was it 
Œ what kind of orie
ntation did it have? 
A: Well, it was Œ it was for cons Œ but it 
was conservat Œ farmers, small farmers, 
you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So th ey had Œ they  Œ th
ey were for post government to
 get rid of those lard Œ 
large landlords, and divided that between th
e peasants and the small farmers. Wi Œ 
not take away, but they paid the landlord fo r Œ for the land.

 just four grades to have, mo re Œ

A: More grades in this school, like the la
rge villages have. And so, various things 

like that. It was not very radical.

de his living and was able to support the family, both 
from the pension, and from farming the land? 

A: Farming, yeah.

Poland
. And so we know from th

knew very  well what is
 going on, and that 
Stalin
 is not better than 
Hitler
. But the 
rest of the 
Euro pe
, rest of the world didn™t believe 
it. Especially intellectuals were 
quite left wing, to th e left bent, and they
 Œ any those news ab
out gulags, you know, 
and so on, they consider 
capitalist propaganda against 
Soviets, you know, against 
socialism, which is the future of the manki

A: You know. So Œ but anyw
ay, wh en war break out and occupation, all Poles have 
to give th e radios to Germans. No Pole can own a radio. So this 
Ka rszits ki
(ph), 
aristocratic family, due to connection 
with some aristocr
atic family in 
Austria
 Œ 
because Œ the territory was, before the war, part of 
Austria
. So some of them were 
even in the Austrian

some Œ 

Q: You™re talking before
 the first World War?

Œ have a Œ the group, you know, how many
, some unit. And they  Œ and they  Œ and 
the Œ and the landlord has tw
o villas, one old, 
and new. So the Germans took the 
new villa and family moved to old villa. 
And it was old, but little Œ maybe little Œ no 
[indecipherable]
 from the 
San 
River, wh ich was boundary. From the river you can 
see the Œ the other side of the rive
r with the Soviet guards, you know. 
Q: Oh really? You were able to do that?

 and 
England
, that there is provocation for 
Hitler

A: If 
Poland

Ta rno w
, so not far from 
Przemy
˚

Ca rpathian
 mountains. So  
down  and dig ho-holes, you know holes ther

get there, I say well, that is Œ situation wa
s, we back, from we are so far. And then 
we hear, very shortly after, artillery, then  machine guns south Œ left from us, not too 
far. So well, I know this 
Slovakia

Slovakia
 and Œ and this is what 
happened, and that was the firs

run to ward us, you know, back. 
Q: Oh, you mean the ones who were retrea

was one anti-tank gun. So, a
ltogether those three different units, the sergeant was a 
commander of that. So when th

, he ask what is going on. 
So Œ and they said that, our forces 
were crossing the bridge, when  from the 
southwest, from 
Slovakia
, the tanks, German tanks, machine guns and artillery, 
start to bombard this bridge
. So many people were killed 
on that bridge. And then 
panic, on Œ somewhere on this side, didn™
t know what to do. Some try looking fo r 
some spot where the river is not 
deep, so they can walk across. 
Q: And this is the 
San

 my father helps. So Œ well, I was not the 
one they  want, they got some other people
 too, because depends that the distances 
and so on. So that 
was my first assignment. And th
en  this ended in December, end 
of December, 1939, because the Gestapo get on the Œ in 
Przemy
˚
l
. But those 
leaders of this thing were, two of them, 
they escape. They we
re simply not home 
when Gestapo came to pick them up, but couple other people were arrested by the 

Gestapo. So, in the very is Œ tough winter
 1939, very large snow, several feet of 
snow was on ta Œ on the Œ so Œ but in 
Œ my  ples Œ my  parents came Professor 
Westfall

life. He was over 50, and 36 kilometer in
 this snow rode Œ he came 36 kilometer 
walking, because there was no other transpor
tation, to tell me that Œ to Œ to Œ to 
notify th e 
Sa rno k

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: To Œ so Œ so he return back same way, 
my father give it Œ him ride to some part 
of Œ of the road, and hoping that maybe 
if somebody else give him Œ and then  I 
walked too. Father gave me
 some part with Œ with ho
rse. And then I walked to 
Sarnok
(ph) to notify th em. Naturally we have code names, and so on, and so Œ 
Q: What was your co de name? 
A: My Œ well, my  code name was di
fferent. I go to so meplace, and I said

Poles have completely cut off 
the rest of the world, they were German Œ allowed to 
publish newspaper in Polish language, bu
t there was German propaganda. Now the

12 people were arrested, and

guards were Ukrainian nationals, workin
g together with Germans. And the 
underground 
[indecipherable]
 about it, lived not far away
, and they decided in first 
action to te Œ tonight get them out. If they

from jail. B ecause if they take Œ take them to 
Rzeszów [indecipherable]
 wh ere is 
military and the Gestapo, and

And so  they get this Œ get 
those Ukrainians lock in on
e of the cells, get all these prisoners out. And they get 
death sentence for this guy who give the name
s of all others. So they get him out of 
the jail, near forest, and shoot 
h i m. And  th is mo men t , al arm fro m 
Rzeszów
, cars are 
going. That was night. So, no Poles have a 
car Œ car, so they knew it was Germans. 
So, alarm, and they ran into 
forest with the prisoners, and this guy was left there. 
And it just happened he was not killed, he 
was Œ he lost conscious Œ consciousness, 
but was still alive. And when
 the Germ Œ Gestapo arrive
d, find out what happened,

, and to hospital, and get 
somebody th ere of their own people to stay

ition was losed in this action, was 
Russian ammunition. And this Russian amm
unition is this Œ in this camp, which 
belonged to Gestapo 
Bialystok
. This is Gestapo 
Rzeszó w
. So they contact 
Jaros
aw
 that from this camp just Œ was 
just ammunition here, so you got 
somebody who carry out this 
ammunition to Polish undergro
und. So Œ and they got 
Miaska
(ph). So get

him. But they get him 
back, and when the Gestapo raise hands, 
he grab on knees, a
nd cry and tell them 
everything what they Œ what

that I worked somewhere there. In 
Ra do m
, about 10 o™clock at evening, the train 
from

, and next day th ey have Gestapo, and 
somebody else they got, they check and th
ey release those who are working in the 
town, because 
Radom 
has factories, armame nt factories, so the Œ many people 
work before the war, so the 
Germans naturally used that 
Œ worked there. So the Œ 
and then Œ well, I was hesitated what to do
, I was not sure if my identification card 
will be good enough, you kn
ow. So, there were people as Œ still some people left. 
And there was one Polish woman who was Œ sh

German Œ Gestapo and so on. There was 
the Germans Œ Gestapo, and also the

go to Œ get to this German 
policeman, this Gestapo guy, get with him and nice Œ 

Q: Friendly, mm-hm. 
A: Œ friendly. And in  meantime, I ran out 
of the room. I know this Polish policeman 
wouldn™t Œ so, naturally they
 opened the door, wa
s slide from the r
oom, in the dark, 
on th e out. So natura
lly I didn™t walk Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ around straight, but to th e side so th
at they won™t see me. 
They  shoot, but then 
I jump at the fence and get Œ but ther
e was poli Œ eight o™clock, police hour. 
Nobody can be on street. 

Q: Curfew, yeah. 

A: You know. So Œ and I he
ar from the corner the poli
cemen, two policemen arrive

Przemy
˚

Q: But this is interesting, 
that the Polish underground was 
supplying, or at least this

 Œ 
Russia
,
 Germany
 
and 
Austria
, the war between them, between 
Austria

Russia
 bring 
the

Œ we trying to do so mething to convince So
viets, and you know, 
so th-they get fight 
Œ start to fight among them
selves, because we came  to conclu sion th at would be

war against Soviets Œ not him Œ don™t sa
y Soviets, but Socialist Republic, you 
know, and so on. And I say Œ I said, wi-wi 
Œ from this information we get, it looks 
like that, because more and more troops is 
in Œ practically in the village Œ in many 
villages. Farmers™ villages ar
e full of military units. So th
ey don™t come there for Œ 
Q: Fun. 

A: Œ any other reason. So Œ and 
buy he d Œ we do

Stalin
 don™t 
believe that Œ that will happen. And 
Stalin
 didn™t believe to the last day. But the 
grou Œ the military units Œ

tary intelligence units? 
A: Yeah.

quarantine field. Because 
Birkenau
 has the fields, each field divided from each 
other by regular fence, a wi
re fence, you know. And Œ 
Q: Did you see other prisoners there? 

A: Well, yes. They were Œ 

Q: Not just from the cattle car, but one
s who had already been there, yes? 
A: Yes Œ no, well, dif Œ as I said, the fiel
ds were only fence, so Œ and there was no 
guard  or anything, so you can go to the 
fence and talk to th
e fellow on th e other 
side. So Œ but on one side there were 
Gypsies, so not mu ch  Œ from all over the 
Euro pe
 whatever Œ whatever the languages th
ey talk, I didn™t know. On the other 
side I don™t remember even 
wa Œ what field it was. So
 Œ and I spen d there three 
weeks, and after three we
eks, instead of go to 
different field, or to 
Auschwitz
, they 
transport me to 
Buchen wald
. 
Q: Oh, so you were in 
Auschwitz
 just for three weeks? 
A: Just for three weeks in 
Birkenau
. 
Q: In 
Birkenau
 Œ 
A: And that was this extermination campfor Jews and Gypsies. There were four 

crematoriums working 24 hours a day. Fift

whole families from trains, from 
this ghetto cars, were simp
ly drived there to Œ to

gas chamber. They told them 
that they are going to  take
 shower; instead of water, 
was gas. 
Q: Can you Œ d Œ wh en you 
were there, do you rememb er
 seeing those crematoria? 
A: Well, I see them from apart, you know Œ 

Q: Distance, from a distance
, but did you know what Œ 
A: From a distance. 

Q: Did you know what they were? 
A: Well, sure we know, because they were
 all prisoners who we
re kapo, you know 
Œ na Œ da Œ well, not kapo, 
the kapo was at work, we we
re not wo rking. Bu t block 
leader, and the 
stubendienst
 Œ well, in 
Auschwitz
 they call 
schreiber
 in 
Buchen wald
 they call 
stubendienst
. They were working Œ 
they were not wo rk ing 
hap Œ they  work ing in barrack. The block le
ad er, he was the head of the block, and 
his helper, 
schreiber
 they called, secretary, or 
stubendien st
 in 
Buch enwald
, would 
take care of cleaning the barrack when we go
 to work, bring food
 at the evening for 
us when we return from work
, so we s Œ the soup was th
ere already, a-and so on. 
And clean the place. So they were old pris
oners, so they know 
a Œ so Œ and when Œ 
when  wind blew from crematoriums in our barrack, we had smell Œ burning, 

characteristic odor, smell. Very characteristic
 Œ flesh, burning fles
h. It was different 
smell than normal, you know, something bur
ning. So  we did know at the beginning 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
118
what Œ why there is different,
 so they told us; this is 
the burning flesh, smell of 
burning flesh. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And so Œ so we saw the Œ I saw from 
not too far, was maybe not even half a 
block through th e pour Œ to this ramp  wh
ere they get these pr
isoners, this Jewish 
families, an d walked them to Œ get th
em to gas chamber. So they said Œ 

Q: So you saw some of t
hose families being walked? 
A: Oh yes, from not Œ really not too far. I 
said not half a Œ not even half a block. 
Less than that. Women with 
babies in their arms. Some young ch ildren, small 
children hanging to  her mo ther™s shirts
 or you know, or father pants.  
Q: And you already knew where they™re going? 

A: Oh yes, we know. You know, that is so
mething Œ so I was very glad wh en  they 
took me, you know, to Œ that
 we are going some Œ that
 I am going somewhere. Not 
alone, but with the Œ hundreds of others. 
We didn™t know where,
 but w-we Œ I wa Œ 
I was glad that I get out from this, I wo
n™t see any mo re, yo
u know, those whole 
families going into  gas chambers. Especially
 those other prisoners who work  there. 
They  got commando called 
Canada Œ Canada
. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
119
A: I don™t know why, because they were 
very good situation,
 because when the 
transport came, they got some bad jo-job. T
hose still alive get out, and th ey have to 
Œ to trans Œ the tr
ain came from far, from 
Greece
 or something. Was three, four 
days on the road. So they go
 in and pick up dead bodies
, old people and ch ildren die 
in those condition. So get those dead b
odies. And those who ge
t out, sometimes the 
whole transport go directly to gas chambe
r, sometimes they make selection, and 
pick up young women, young men, mo r Œ 
less often wo men, mo re men, to wo rk, 
you know; young, 
strong, healthy. 
Q: Did you see any of these selections? 

A: Well, from afar, not Œ 
Q: From afar, from afar. 
A: Œ close, not close. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So Œ but they Œ th ey si Œ this Œ a
ll prisoners, you know, who work over there, 
they told  us what is going on. So is Œ they
 said that someti mes parents went to gas, 
and daughter and son, young, strong, stay
 in th e camp , and parents went to gas 
chamber. Well, they didn™t st
ay in the camp to work 
long en ough, because in the 
condition and the si Œ physical and mental 
Œ you know, knowing th
at the parents are 
dead already, they didn™t 
stay too long, they
 Œ not knowing food, 
they get weaker, 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

and when  they cannot work  hard  enough, 
so they follow th
eir parents to gas 
chamber. 
Q: The people who Œ the peopl
e who were older prisoners th
ere, w ere they Polish as 
well? 

A: No, they were all different nationalities. In 
Auschwitz
 majority of them were 
Poles, yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: In 
Buchenwald
, no, but in 
Auschwitz
 majority were Poles,
 because for quite a 
while 
Auschwitz
 was camp for Poles. According to
 history, and I read somewhere, 
the first transport to 
Auschwitz
, th-they Œ wh en they  opened the camp  Œ because 
Auschwitz
 was, before the war was military 
barracks. They were two floors -- 
build ings Œ brick buildings, you know. So  
they just build later crematorium, and 
some other things they n
eeded, surrounded th
em with barbed wires, fence and 
towers with for Œ with guard s 
with machine guns and so on. 
Q: Were you Œ when  you were
 being transported, did yo
u Œ did you know th at you 
were being taken to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, I didn™t know. 

Q: You didn™t know. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
121
A: I don™t know where. They get us from 
Tarnów
 to train, and this is it. I get Œ 
when  we get close to 
Auschwitz
 I knew station, so I thought that maybe we are 
going to 
Auschwitz
, and we went to Œ to 
Auschwitz
. Same thing later to 
Buchen wald
, I didn™t know where we go, but 
I know geograp hy, so on the Œ on the 
way, the towns, you know, we pass 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know if I go Œ we go 
to 
Buch enwald
, or to 
Dach au
, or some other camp in 
Germany
. 
Q: Did you know th e names of these German camp s by then? 
A: Yes, we knew some name.
 Dachau
 we knew. We knew 
Buch enwald
. There was 
Sach senhausen
 near 
Berlin
. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And Œ no, and Œ and 
Auschwitz
. So we knew already, especially in underground 
we know, we got some info
rmation. We have some 
prisoners who escape from 
Auschwitz
, and Œ 
Q: Had you met any of the prisoners who escaped? 

A: I didn™t met them, but they  were 
in the ungra Œ underground paper, you know, 
the condition Œ this situation 
over here, what it is there,
 and so  on. But when I get 
there, I still came to conclusion that I Œ 
I know very little. It is imp o ssible in wars, 
to describe the ca Œ the feelings, you know. 
This barbed  wires, this guard s, those 
SS

men with the dogs, and those prisoners. Many
 they call Œ they call them Œ oh gee, 
remember Œ the Œ well they
 Œ it will come to me. 
Q: Okay, okay. So, what ki
nd of work  did they have you do during those three 
weeks in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Oh, th ree weeks nothing, we didn™t do 
anything special. That was quarantine. 
Q: Okay . 
A: They wi Œ we did not left the camp. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So the block leader, who was German, in 
this case Œ in my case, when I was Œ he 

was German political comm
unist, they said. The 
stubendienst
, I don™t know. He 
was, I think, green, because we had tr
iangle. Red triangle was political prisoner. 
And there was letter 
P
 for Pole, 
R
 for Russian, you know
. And then, on this 
triangle, below this triangle, was a number. 

Q: So you Œ the number that was 
on your arm was on the triangle.  
A: Yes, also here and here. 

Q: On your pants Œ okay. 

A: Here was also just the numbe
r, nothing, no triangle there, but Œ 
Q: Okay .

123
A: Œ but here triangle. Then  recognize Œ 
criminals had green triangles. That was Œ 
we recognize that is a cr
iminal prisoner. Now, the re
ligious, by Œ those jude Œ 
Jehovah Witness, and some other sects who re
fused to serve in military, so they got 
purple triangle. 
Q: And was everybody in your barrack
s with the red triangle with the 
P
? 
A: All red Œ red triangle. Well, th e first Œ at 
the beginning in this tra Œ in the Œ in the 
mar Œ matter of fact, in 
Buchenwa ld 
too, there were barracks Œ block, they call it, 
nationalities. There were few blocks in 
Buchenwald
, there were a few blocks Poles 
only. There was also one block for Jews in the Œ in the camp there. 

Q: In 
Buchenwald
, or Œ 
A: In 
Buchenwald
, yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And they  said that there were some 
engineers, you know, ve
ry high, technically 
educated people, and they n
eed them, so this was the re
ason they keep them there. 
Q: Okay. So after the quarantine Œ and that 
was to make sure that you didn™t bring 
in typhus or something? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. After the quarantine, one day Œ 
A: Well, they pick up us ag
ain, put in the train, and we went. I don™t know where. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
124
Q: Okay . Okay. 
A: Well, I was lucky that I get to 
Buchen wald
, because many went to 
Austria
. 
Q: 
Mauthausen
? 
A: 
Mauthausen
. Which was bad because they  got stone 
quarrel
 main work there. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So th e work  was very
 hard. They got stone 
quarrel
 in 
Buch enwald
 too, but this 
was one of the comma nde
rs, not the large one. 
Q: So tell Œ 

A: And there were ma ny others. 

Q: Œ tell me, when you got to Œ did y
ou recognize geographically wh ere you were? 
Could you see through the cattle car? 
Was there a window or something? 
A: Yes, when we we
re going Œ I rememb er 
Nysa
. There™s 
Nysa
 now in 
Poland
. 
That is partisan 
Poland
 after the war, 
Nysa
, 
Nysa
. So, and th e po Œ the train stop 
there, and some people, Germ
ans, because that was German
 territory already, some 
people on the station waiting for train, we
re talking Polish ba
ndits, Polish bandits 
are in the train. 

Q: 
Ponish
(ph) 
bandyta

A: So I hear that from th
ere, through th e Œ and I didn™t feel bad about. 
Q: 
[laughter]
 Okay, so you knew you were in 
Ny sa
, in 
Germany
. 
A: 
Nysa 
si Œ well, I didn™t know where we are 
going, but when we get Œ we get in 
Weimar
, from the railr Œ from the station, and 
we walk, then I came to conclusion 
that we are probably going to 
Buchenwa ld
 because 
Buchenwald™s
 just north or 
Weimar
. 
Q: So what train sta
tio n did you go to, the 
Weim a r  
central train station, or to a 
special one that was close to Œ 
A: No, we Œ the regular Œ regular station, 
that you don™t Œ don™t have extra trains, 
other e-extra tracks. 
Q: No extra tracks to 
the camps themselves? 
A: No, to the camps 
they have, but to 
Buchenwa ld Œ  
and 
Buchenwa ld 
is on Œ on 
the slope of a hill. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So the train thi Œ can™t get Œ can get close to it, but not to the 
Buch enwald
 itself. 
Q: Okay . And what did it l
ook like as you were going from 
Weimar 
to 
Buchen wald
? What was Œ 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
126
A: Well, pe Œ nice territory, this 
Thuning en
(ph), central 
Germany
. A n d  
Weim ar Œ
 
and Œ and 
Buchen wald
 is sort of Œ
 Weimar 
is just south of 
Ha rz
 mountains, which 
are very nice Œ nice range of mountains in 
Germany
. And 
Buchenwa ld
 is closer to 
mountains than 
Weimar 
itself. 
Weimar 
is well known , dred Œ German 
[indecipherable]
 spend a lot of time there, in 
Weimar
. And so we walked from 
Weimar 
to 
Buchen wald
 east, about seven or eight 
kilo meters. And at that time 
Buchen wald
 was not very bad camp , because th
at was 1943, at yet the end of 
September or beginning of
 October, because they ne
ed workers. They built Œ 
outside of 
Buchen wald
 they built 12 factories, 12 holes
 [indecipherable]
 each one 
Œ in each hole they wo
rk Œ they Œ they prod
uce something else. Majority of this pla 
Œ of the holes were produci
ng so mething fo r the military. 
Q: And so, when  you got Œ  
A: So, it was th-the holes were Œ they
 built barb wires fence same as around 
Buchen wald
, and around th e constellation camp , 
and with everything else. And so 
in the morning when they op
ened, when we supposed to 
go to war, the guard took 
position in those spaces where they supposed
 to be, and they ope
ned the gates, and 
we walked  to 
[indecipherable]
 the holes where we work. 
Q: And what ho Œ wh-w hat ho
le were you assigned to? 
A: I didn™t work in this, cau
se I w o rked someplace else. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
127
Q: Okay , where did Œ 
A: I work for the b Œ for a wh
ile inside the wooden Œ I split 
the Œ the Œ this part with 
the roots, you know, of tree, which is Œ 
Q: The trunk of the tree. 
A: The end of the tree inside, you know, a
nd cut here. So  they 
brought over there, 
and my job was split them and Œ in small piec
es, so those other guys with saw, they 
make it wood fo r burning fo r whatever. 
Q: Okay, so what you had to do
 was split the trunks of trees? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . And th is was Œ 
A: That was light work, you know. 
Q: Well, it™s not like lifting stones, that™s for sure. 

A: But it was very hard. 

Q: Was it? 
A: Well, sure. I learned na Œ for example, 
I na Œ I didn™t know that. I would think 
that Œ that the Œ the hardwood,
 you know, it is hard to sp
lit. And Œ but the reverse is 
true. Hardwood is easy to split. Your make
 little strength, and they got special steel 
and wood thing, you know. Y
ou make in this group, steel Œ this Œ I don™t know the 
na Œ E-English name for that. And you h
it with the hammer two or three times, and 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

128
it wents down, and split little more. So make 
bigger thing, and then you take larger, 
or even wooden thing, and you hit with heavy Œ 
Q: What instrument did you have to use? 
A: Well, the regular Œ no Œ 
Q: Ax, or hammer? 

A: La Œ hammer. 

Q: Hammer. So you had a hammer to be 
able to split the wood, but no axes or 
anything like that? 

A: Well, there were axes to help, yo

™t have much hospital, but as I said, 
because they sent th
e workers to mil Œ they mobilize 
workers, German workers, so 
they need to replace them, 
they replace them with pr
isoners. So that was the 
situation, that condition were much easier th
an before. So Œ so finally I got this very 
Œ I could not put the shoe Œ foot in the sh
oe, so they send me to a hospital. There 

was a barrack like our barracks, large r

A: Well, I have Œ well, if you 
Œ they Œ once in  a while they
 send me to Œ to here, to 
there. Nothing s Œ no, ne-n
either one was any special. Oh, the most important. 
Later, I get as a Œ as a
ll prisoners already Œ in 
Buchen wald
 there was two lagers, 
two camps. Main camps and small camps. Sm
all camps, there was few barracks for 
quarantine. And they  were separated by
 fence. By the regular fence, not Œ 
Q: Barbed wire. 

A: Œ barb ed wires, and no ga
 Œ ga Œ guards or anything. Only  there was a door 
leading to it in the Œ in this fence, 
and there was one prisoner on duty checking 
permission to Œ from the 
camp, to small camp. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
139
Q: Okay . 
A: Why? Because the small camp  was quara
ntine camp. New prisoners. And I, for 
example, once in four weeks, they re Œ ke Œ in 
Buchenwa ld
, they send postcards to 
the families. It was important to notify fam
ily that I am alive. 
Another one they can 
get Œ we can get parcels from re Œ families to 
Buchen wald
. So, not a very important 
thing with all this Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ not enough food and so
 on, everybody was getting sk
in and Œ bone and skin. 
Q: Sk Œ yeah . 
A: And Œ and so  it was important. So I fe
lt the pa Œ th e Œ one margarine Œ befo re 
breakfast we got piece of bread, and one ma
rgarine, in a regular Œ regular Œ you 
know, one margarine, this th
ing. So it was important to 
save some piece of bread 
and piece of the margarine fo
r noon, because at noon you 
will Œ we Œ we were Œ we 
were getting half quart of Œ supposed to be
 coffee, but there was no coffee. Ersatz 
coffee, that™s terrible. So it was important to
 have piece of bread to work  after noon. 
At the beginning we
 didn™t know that, because ever
ybody Œ there was not too much, 
this piece of bread for one Œ 
Q: Person. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
140
A: Yeah. For breakfast. And so  Œ but 
[indecipherable]
 and so th is piece of 
margarine was 25 cents on the black 
market, and the postcard was four 
pfennigs 
Œ 
25 Œ not cents, but 
pfennigs
, the German Œ no, German, 
pfennig
 Œ 
Q: Yeah, 
pfennigs
, 
pfennig
. 
A: Œ yeah , 
pfennig
, 25 
pfennigs
. And postcard was four. So I give the four 
margarine for postcard. 
Q: Wow. 
A: This is the way th ey  handle, you know
, black market. And that was tho-tho-those 
guard s were to protect us from wi Œ di  Œ from, you know, getting advantage from 
us, but didn™t work much. But 
anyway, after some Œ near th
e end of Œ befo re this Œ 
when  they  bombed 
Buchenwa ld
 in August, I was already wo
rking in  Œ inside in the 
ga Œ in th e camp, and I just watched thos
e airplanes bombing with very big smile. 
Q: Now, you said there wa Œ was a Jewish barracks, as well? 

A: In 
Buchenwald
 there was one barrack Jews only. 
Q: And they  were privileged Œ not
 privileged, but they  were Œ 
A: Not privileged. This way Œ 

Q: Œ but they were kept 
because they had skills. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
141
A: Yes. This is wh
at they told us 
[indecipherable]
 other prisoners, you know, 
older. They were longer there,
 so they knew more
 about, that this
 is, they are skill 
workers, and this is the re
aso n  th ey  k e ep  th em th ere.  
Q: Okay . Did you have any contact with 
them directly, or were they separate? 
A: No, we had no contact, a
nd they warn us other pris

because if the Germans notice, you can be in trouble. 

Q: Okay. Were people dying a lot? 
A: Well, they were dying. 
They ™d get beaten 
at work by prisoners
, other prisoners. 
So there was a system, unhu
man system, that human k
ill other humans. Prisoners 
kill other prisoners just to survive. 

Q: How did Œ how did k
illing another prisoner he
lp somebody
 survive? 
A: Well, he was 
vorarbeiter
, or kapo Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you know. So he didn™t 
work. So that was great advant
age. Even if he don™t get 
more food, or anything, but at least he 
doesn ™t have to work. So, he has more 
chances, you know,
 to survive. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But he have to do the job. Naturally, th
ey were, majority of them trying not ju st 
to look when  kapo is coming, so work  hard
er, you know, we know that. So we did.

Well, the kapo went and

watching, not to get in trouble himself, but 
at the same time he didn™t push us any 
hard. He got this wooden stick, but he di
dn™t use. But there were some who did. 
Same thing was kapos. Kapo had three, f
our groups, and he wa
lk from one group to 
another, you know, to check on the 
vorarbeiters
 and we work . And he also was 
armed with wooden stick, and 
he used that quite often. 
Q: So you™re talking a four Œ

A: It Œ 
Bad Ga ndersheim
 we supposed to build Œ well,
 first we built Œ they have no 
Œ there was no camp. Now 200 came from 
Buchen wald
 first transport, I was in first 
transport, and then more. All together ther
e were about 550 of us. Majority of them 
were fra Œ Frenchmen, Italian 
and Russian. And then later, from 
Auschwitz
 came 
about 50 Poles and few from 
Buchenwald
, so all together wa
s about 55 - 56 Poles, 
but were hundred s of Italia
ns, Russians and Frenchmens. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And so first we have to build our barrack
s, our camp. They  put us to sleep in old 
monastery from medieval™s time, which wa
s not used as monastery, because the 
territory became Protestant, co
mpletely hundred percent. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So th is monastery was practically barn; 
the landlord, large landlord used this as Œ 
for hay, straw, and things like that. So 
we sleep there and bu
ild our barracks, and 
dig ditches to Œ to get 
sewers, water and so on. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So, we get there in September, and I th
ink lend of Œ end of 
Decemb er, we moved 
to our barracks already, from

Milicz
. 
A: Œ in 
Poland
, built just before the war. 
Open, I think, in 1938. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And naturally Germans t
ook over, they  use it. But when  the Soviets army  were 

approaching, they get all these men to
 all the machines, and send them to 
Bad 
Gandersheim
, and they built factory to
 bil Œ for build airplane
s. So we supposed to 
build the airplane, but first we have to 
build our barracks, our camp, o-our sewers 
an-and everything else. Then  one group get 
those boxes, and install in the hole, the 
hole was ready. Then  they we
re barracks like long and Œ 
but brick buildings, not too 
far away, next to this factory, where th
e German masters live.
 Civilians, you know, 
electrician, whatever what th
ey need, professional people 
to help, you kno
w, in this 
Œ to build this factory. And so we inst
alled those machines and Œ and so on, and 
then we, sometimes in winter we star
t to build the airplane. There was no Œ 
someplace else they bra Œ bring the mortars,
 you know, for Œ and 
we build just this 
thing, but we didn™t finish 
it, not even one sa Œ Ap ril fi
rst. Instead of go to work, 
they decided that we walk to 
Buchenwald
.

weaker. Some people cannot walk, older 
people especially cannot walk, because 
they were too weak. And th ey took them 
one side, shoot them, 
and we went further. 
That was called death march, and ther

A: Well, one night we Œ we 
were already in mountains. 
You know, fields, forests, 
not much any places, were here and there 
some motels, hotels,
 you know, on the 
road. So me hotels, specially for tourists
 you know, and the peop

vacation in mountains, you know, so some 
sanitoriums. And one evening we were 
getting close to night, and we hear dog 
Œ dog barks, you know

there. So we get to farm where they rais
ed these German Shepherds, those German 
dogs. So  they put us Œ dark was just about 
approach ing, so they put us against barn.

A: I don™t know how many, but we were Œ th
ey put us on field, we Œ we Œ oh, we 
hear already not just artillery, but machine guns. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So this means that Britis
h and American forces are cl
osing. So they put us one 
night in large pile of straw and so on, on 
th e field. And in the mo rning, close to 

morning, we Œ first time we hear this
 machine guns, even
 artillery, and then 
machine. So first thing was we try Œ in the 
mo rning we stay again, we don™t go out. 
Well, early in the morning, 
just -- just little, n o t completely daytime, trucks arrive 
and get out Œ they get us 
out. And we decided that we
 will stay here. There was 
about 50 of us Poles, and we got one 
fellow, he was oldest
 one among us, and by 
profession he was engineer from 
Poland
. And so we Œ so the people get out, and we 
stands there. Then trucks arrive, and th
en  in last mo ment, this guy says, you know 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
156
what? Ma Œ this is not Œ no time, let™s go. We just jump out. Shortly after they start 
to machine guns in the straw, and t
hose who stay there all were killed.  
Q: Oh my God. 
A: Some of them tried to escape, you kn
ow, get out, but they were knocked down 
by the machine gun. So we were lucky. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But next day Œ the same day, the truc
ks Œ we went thro ugh a town  wh ich was no 
Œ no any authority in uniform. They had civilians Œ civilians militia. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Civilians with old guns, you know 
[indecipherable]
 keep order, you know, the 
town . So  we know th at there™s no Œ an
y police, not even  no Gestapo, no army , 
nobody else. So Œ and they ge
t us through this town, and dr
op us in the field. Near 
was forest, and so now we st
art to get to Œ get Œ what 
the hell to do? And we came 
to conclu sion, they ™re now th
e guard. There was one Œ one 
SS
 officer, I don™t 
remember his title now, who was from 
Poland
, German from 
Poland
; speak Polish 
as good as I did. And when they start to 
kill those guys who cannot walk all Œ all the 
way, the le Œ and they were weak, cannot 
walk, they ju st take them outside and 
shoot them, and we go further. Was Œ was 
50 of us, we put ourself arms, and we 
decide Œ we got some few older people with
 Œ among us, that we are not going to 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
157
allow that. In case they try to
 pick up anyone from us, th
e closest one un Œ und Œ di 
Œ di Œ guard Œ we jump on the closest guard
, and get his gun, we
 can Œ they will kill 
Œ older guns Œ older guys will kill few of us
, but we will get gun, and then we can 
be 
[indecipherable]
 the rest. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So Œ and this guy, he was 
in charge of this march fro m 
SS
, this guy from 
Poland 
Œ German from 
Poland
. And he saw that we are walk
ing like that, and he came to 
us in Polish. He told us, don™t be afraid. 
The Œ you™re is Œ you Œ it is okay, you are 
okay. Don™t be afraid, nothing
 will happen to you guys. 
Q: Mm-hm. And so wh en did you run away ? 
A: So, in this field, as I said, they jump
 Œ dump  us from the trucks, and we came to 
conclusion that this is the 
time to Œ is forest nearby, they  won™t Œ now, the guard 
change a exce Œ with ex ception of two or th ree younger 
SS
, those 
Hitler
 followers, 
the rest were old men from the first Worl
d War, 50 or 60 years old. They  mobilized 
them, and they replaced the younger 
SS
, who went to fight. They  Œ th ey put them as 
a guard in  that Œ and so we know that they  won™t shoot us, they will shoot guard  in 
the window is where we were sending, you know.

full, this little hotel was full, and so he 
stayed over there. But 
I went there, back. 
They told me to come
 back. So  I went back , and no, th
at is it. But shortly after, w-
we were consider a small camp. There we
re altogether us about 13 - 14 people, 
because couples, and there were some 
married, two or three that were Œ 
Q: All journalists, or 
families Œ and families. 
A: Œ couple were married. They were 
Œ one wo man, she was Œ she was not the 
journalist, but she was very useful 
because she was drawing, you know.  
Q: Right. 

A: And so she was helpful, 
very  Œ like the first page, you know, especially some 
drawing on first page. And 
so 12 - 13 people. We were 
consider a small camp. And 
UNRRA
, this international organization which 
supply food for th
e displaced person 
camps, we Œ supply us with food, with Œ 
with clothing, and whatev er they have. 
And they notify us because we are Nazi, we
 are taking Œ they don
™t supply us any 
mo re. So we went as Germans, thousand cal
ories a day, but we have to buy th at 
food, and we have no mone
y, bu Œ from where? Buy th e 
food from Germans. So it 
was quite Œ 

Q: So there was the Americans now Œ inst
ead of the British, it was the American 
MP
? 
A: Americans, because Uncle 
Joe Stalin
, they were Uncle 
Joe

183
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you know, Uncle 
Joe
. And so it was bad situation. 
So we get some money, and 
we get th-the Œ in we Œ they Œ two, thr
ee times a Œ a week, we got herring, because 
they went to buy from th
e barrels, you know. They  
were cheap, and so with 
potatoes, we have dinner 
[indecipherable]
 because we cannot afford to 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And you like herring. 
A: I like, so it was no-not bad for me. I Œ 
I got nothing against, but th ese others 
didn™t like it. 
Q: I want to Œ I want to summarize this a 
little bit. What you™re saying is that you 
work ed on a weekly Po lish newspaper. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And that Polish newspaper was also again critical of the 
Soviet Union Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and eventually the American 
MPs
 come and close it down, accusing you of 
being Nazis, so you can™t 
publish the paper any mo re. 
A: No.  
Q: And the reason that you™re 
giving is that the influence of the Soviets Œ that is, as 
you put it, Uncle 
Joe
, reached into the Am
erican zone. And Œ 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

184
A: Look Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ the Americans at that time, Am
erican opinion, American press, Mr. 
Roosevelt 
were all full of praise to 
[indecipherable]
. American soldiers, I hear from 
American soldiers, Uncle 
Joe
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: They do Œ they didn™t te
ll Œ they didn™t talk about 
Stalin
 otherwise but Uncle 
Joe
. Well, you have to admit 
that Soviet army break Œ 
broke Œ broke the power of 
Hitler
. That is not question about that. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But they did not do that
 because they were against 
Hitler
, or because they love 
Americans. But 
Hitler 
attacked them, and they have Œ 
Stalin
 had no choice, 
surrendered, or fo Œ fight. So he decide
d to fight. And now 
American and British 
jump  to help  him, and a Œ not just help
 him, but embrace him. And the commu nist 
propaganda took over press and everything in 
England
 and in brit Œ 
Great Britain
, 
and in ev erywhere else. And th erefore, 
Stalin 
was Uncle 
Joe
. 
Q: All right. So, when th
e Americans closed you do
wn, the American military 
authorities Œ 
A: Yeah.

Q: Œ do you believe they were doing it 
because you were Œ you 
were being not only 
critical, but you were attacking an ally of theirs? 
A: Well, this is what they 
told us, that we are Nazis, because we are working to 
break the alliance, you know, sp
read between the Œ the get Œ 
Q: Dissension between the a Œ 

A: Dissension between allies. Th
is was the Œ th-th-the reason. 

Q: And they  didn™t understand, or they di
dn™t see a difference that you were coming 
from 
Poland
, and had your own experience. 
A: No, th ey don™t understand that, and as
 I said, I was in Po
lish army when we 
fought Germans, and we were attacked for 
Soviets. So I had on my  back proof, and 
what I believe it is right. But they didn™t 
know that. Well, as I said, you have to 
admit that the Soviet army 
really broke the power of 
Hitler
 army. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: You know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: The ar Œ th Œ 
No rma ndy  
would be probably two year
s later, and with il Œ will 
cost thousands more of lives, American, Brit
ish lives, if not the 
Soviet™s army. That 
is true. But as I said, th-they don™t fight, be
cause for Œ because they were against, or 

something, but they  had no choice Œ 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ because 
Hitler
 attacked them and Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ and they Œ and they Œ 
Q: But what I™m gettin g at, or what I want 
to try and clarify is, the first time that 
your little newspaper, that 
you published 
yourself Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ then you are arrested in the British zone. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: The reason why you were 
arrested is that it went 
to the Polish communists, it 
went to 
Warsa w
, it went to Œ 
A: No, well they Œ you know, beca
use the communists took that Œ 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: Œ you know, th Œ they
 were not too far away. 
Q: Yeah, let me finish the question. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . That it went Œ that Œ and in Œ one could make the argument that it was 
Soviet influence that made your arrest
 happen, because it went from the Po lish

communists, to 
Warsaw
, to 
Moscow
, to 
London
, to 
Germany
, and you would be 
arrested by the Brits, yes? 
A: Well, the British didn™t know, they don™t
 read Polish, so th
ey would not know 
what I am writing there. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So, it went, you know, this way, 
and to embassy Œ Soviet embassy in 
London
, to 
the British government, and British government to the commander of 
Rhin e 
army, 
and so on. That was the Œ 

Q: Okay, but one can make 
the argument that it was So
viet influence, Soviet 
pressure. 
A: Yes, yes, yeah. 
Q: The second time, when 
the Americans come and close down  this newspaper, 
would it be Soviet pressure, or would it be
 that the Americans don™t want to offend 
the Soviets and do it on their own? 
A: Well, that was Œ it was not direct Œ it 
was not, you know, thro ugh th e diplomatic 
channels, you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It was probably some higher-ups in Amer
ican govern ment in Œ occupying forces

honest man. He was for 24 or 28 years

Senator 
Percy

Interview with JohnKrawiec

204
Œ I think I am the only one no
n-Jew. Now I learn there™s another Polish fellow. But, 
they came to conclusion that those Jewi
sh survivors sometimes they cannot tell 
them much, because they were hid Œ 
hidden somewhere by Poles, or by Œ 
Q: Other people, yeah . 
A: Œ Dutch, or whatever nationality the 
ne Œ country they were, an attic, or 
somewhere, and they  don™t know mu ch wh
at was going on. The only thing that they 
were there and somebody helped
 them to surv
ive. So in 
Poland
 was death sentence 
for the whole family for helping Jews. An
d I know one case not too far from my  
village from Œ through relatives and so on. It was really  
family with six children. 
And they had two co Œ dra Œ Jewish cop. 
They got some on attic, you know, some Œ 
they stay right there. And Œ and th ey brin
g the food, you know, things like that. And 
I don™t know how th ey get Œ the Germans get Œ 

Q: The information. 

A: Œ the information, but anyway, one 
mo rn ing they Œ German Œ Gestapo plus 
German police, surrounding th eir house. Th
ey get the Jews out, the whole fami ly 
out on th e yard. They  shoot th
e Jews, then the children, starting from the oldest, and 
finishing on Œ on Œ on the youngest one, one ye
ar old, and then th e parents. This the 
way was in 
Poland
 for helping Jews. And that is true
, there™s not Œ not story. It is 
fact. And there were more facts like that, 
not too many, but Œ but there were others. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
205
This I know through family, through Œ b
ecause there was in village not far away 
from the village where I was born. 
Q: Tough. Tough. 
A: Yeah, it was tough. And you know, so it is
 Œ and only in po Œ 
in other countries, 
for sa Œ helping Jew, there was concen
tration camp. I don™t know why th ey got 
maybe because there was the large Œ the Œ in 
Poland
, there were three and a half 
million Jews in 
Poland
 before the war, 10 percent 
of the population. And in 
addition, they Œ 
Poland 
was consid er part of German 
lebensraum
, the territory the 
Germany
 needs to create thousand years empire. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Accord ing to  
Hitler
. Well, so they exterminate Po
les, not as Jews, you know, 
but because they were born. 
But they use any pre Œ pretex
t to kill Poles. They Œ but 
two millions Poles were taken to 
Germany
 to work in factories, and on farms. After 
the war bar Œ there were about two million Poles in 
Germany
. So, in  any condition, 
any pretext they have 
to kill, they did. 
Q: How do you explain that you survived ? 
A: How do I explain? Well, 
I was lucky. That is probabl
y the mo st important part. I 
was young, I Œ I was strong, and I was tough. 

Q: Like you said in the beginni
ng, there was a bit of a devil. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

206
A: Little devil, you know, it was little devil, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, it was will to live. It was importa
nt. But not for any price. The price we 
didn™t want pay, it is to cooperate with
 Germans. And those who did, they were 
sorry, and quite often, ended their life later. There was a case Œ I don™t know 

personally, but it Œ he wrote 
little book or Œ or something,
 story, right aft Œ shortly 
after the war. He was a Jewish fellow, Jewi
sh policeman in Jewi
sh ghetto, in some 
suburb of 
Warsaw
. And he escorted his li Œ his wife
 and beloved nine
, 10 years old 
daughter to the train going to 
Treblinka
, to the gas chambers. 
Q: I know th e book. 
A: Know Œ you know Œ

Q: So, I think we™ve come to 
the end of the road, as far as Œ well, we never could, 
we could talk for hours. I Œ I have Œ I have a Œ 
A: That is Œ that is for sure, really . 
Q: I have a feeling that there Œ 
A: You know, I lived 95 years Œ 

Q: There™s a lot to say. 

A: Œ so it is long live Œ long 
lifes and lo t of things happen. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So I can talk 95 years. 

Q: Good. But thank you for what you™ve sh
ared with us today. I think that it™s 
amazing, packed in, and Œ an
d thank you very mu ch fo r 
all those memories and all 
those experiences, and what you learned from 
those experiences. It is varied, it is 
not Œ it is not in one line. There™s so ma
ny things that you™ve 
talked about today, 
that were ironic, that y
ou wouldn™t expect, you know? 
A: No, I didn™t. 
Q: Yeah, but Œ and yet, they happened. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And it™s important for us to know 
th ese things. So , do you have any final 
thoughts before we co nclude our interview? 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
208
A: Well, I don™t know what, what. 
Q: Okay . Then, thank you. 

A: You rememb er not to do th e same thing ag
ain, but I don™t believe in very  Œ I Œ I 
came to conclusion that human
s are beasts, potential beasts. 
Q: Yeah, potential. 

A: Potential beasts. 

Q: Potential. 
A: Yeah. So  I don™t know if you can avoi
d that, you know. After the Holocaust, it 
happened in many countries again, after Œ until now. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: In many co Œ places. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, it happen in many places. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So Œ well, shoot, it is good to Œ the 
young generation learn, so they, young 
generation learn about. Because that Œ it has some influence Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ on them. I have Œ I met some wh
o don™t believe in Holo caust. Jews. 
Q: Who don™t believe in the Holocaust? 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec  
 
January 29, 2015 
 

 
 
209
A: Holocaust, yeah. There was a book writte
n by a Jewish fellow, I think from Œ he 
was in 
DePaul
 Un iv ersity, who wrote the bo
ok, it is a Holocaust business 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Ah, I know. It™s 
Finkelstein
(ph), I think. 
A: Something like that, yeah. 
Q: Like that, yeah, yeah. 

A: And so I get Œ 
Q: The Holocaust industry. 
A: He Œ Holocaust in
dustry, yeah, yeah. 
Q: That™s what it was. 
A: Yeah. And I Œ before they
 got this building here in 
Sko kie
, they had Œ they 
rented. So it was a smaller place, and the r
oom was for 60 chairs. So quite often we 
have to go to some schools,
 you know, large group, and ta
lk to them in school. So 
that has some good part, because we c Œ 
it depends on the school how mu ch time I 

get. Here I got half hours, you know.
 And over there, sometimes I get hour, 
sometimes even more. But he
re they go through museum
, so they learn about the 
many things, you know, ghettos and things lik
e that. Well, over there they don™t do 
that, so I have to mention ab out that. I 
don™t Œ I didn™t know ex actly what happened 
in ghetto, because I was not there. I know qui
te a bit, but this is not the same thing. 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

And so it Œ I met some people, as I said, 
some teachers, who didn™t believe it, an d 
one time, when we were going out, me Œ 
sometimes teachers ask students to write 
their impression. So I had several of t
hose letters, I don™t know, maybe close to 
hundreds of them, and they sent later to 
me Œ they sent to Ho locaust mu seum, and 
the mu s Œ mu seum to me. And there were
 one or two letters, Jewish money Œ 
Jewish girl. She mentioned that, that she didn™t believe 
[indecipherable]
 at home, 
they didn™t believe. But then
, when she saw non-Jew, Po
lish Catholic, who was in 
Auschwitz
-
Birkenau
, and he got tattoo numb ers, so he was there. And he said that 
what happened to Jews, that they went directly to gas ch
ambers, so he decide Œ she 

believe now. 
Q: That™s an am Œ th
at is an amazing Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: That is an amazing transformation, a
nd it shows the value of your showing Œ 
A: Direct Œ direct Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ contact, you know. 

Q: Yes. 
A: I Œ I know it is important in 
Poland
, fo r example, when I go to  my  high school, 
the history teachers always grab  me, and 
talk to students, 
you know, about. And 

 
Interview with JohnKrawiec

211
then I ask Œ go talk to students, how wh at 
Œ they said, well, you know, we learn that 
from the book, from Œ teachers told us an
d so on, but what, 70 years ago? Fo r me, 
what is the difference, 70 or 200 years? 
Q: It™s true. 
A: You know. 

Q: It™s true. 

A: This is what he Œ exac
tly what that student told 
me. And  h e re co mes so me b ody  
alive, who said that he was beat, that he 
was afraid, that Œ you 
know, what happened 
to him, and he told us wha Œ it bring clos
er this whole history get closer to us. 

Q: Which is also Œ 
A: And this is my sense. 
Q: This is true. 

A: It makes sense. 

Q: And this is why what you have shared 
with us today is so valuable, because 
through this testimony, many, many people 
will be able to hear it, and many, many 
people will be able to Œ 

A: I don™t know how many those things th
ey™v e got already in  Ho locaust mu seum, 
in schools, because I went to school, they
 call me, some schools; American schools, 
some this Polish. Saturday, 
Po lish language school, so th
