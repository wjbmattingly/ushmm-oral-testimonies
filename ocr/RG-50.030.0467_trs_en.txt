A:  I, my name i s Robert

pest  in 1929, August  31. 
 

Q: And, will you tell me so
mething about your 
mother and your father, their, their names and their 
fa mi ly ba ckgrounds?  
 

A:  My father was, my fat her™s 
name is Lajos Holczer.  He comes fr om a very poor working class  
fa mi l y , a Je wi s h  fa mi l y  t h at  was 
almost totally assimila
ted into the Proletaria
n e nvir onme nt.  They  
lived on the outskirts of 
Buda pest  in a tene ment  wit hout a ny wa
t er a nd el ectricit y.  M y gr andmot her 
was practically the sole supporter 
of the fa mily until th
e children got a little 
bit older because my  
grandfat her wa s a, what you woul d c all a 
lumpe n prol etary
 
(ph)
 pers on who di d not re ally care t oo  
much about father responsi
bilities.  The, so my fath
er was the oldest one who 
made it into adult life,  
there was somebody el se
 ahead of hi m but die d of tube rcul osis.  And he  has always bee n a great 
support t o hi s brot hers a n d sister s.  He  was a wo
r ki ng ma n, he has al wa ys worke d for other pe opl e.  
Eve ntually, he beca me  kind of a , 
a n a mateur dr uggist , worke d for  
comp anies but he did not have a 
for mal e duc ation and a ft er the war ,
 he joined a co-op.  He rose to
 ki nd of a mi d-level  ma nagerial  
posit ion but he basi cally wa s al wa
ys  j ust a  wor king ma n.  He neve
r we nt beyond t he s econd gra de  
and he taught himself how to read and write and 
everything else.  He ha
d exceptional qualities in  
math and law.  My mother
1
 comes from a small nort
he rn Hungaria n town, Va cz
.  This is where the 
Da nube t urns suddenl y s out h a nd 
she comes fr om a middle cl ass fa
mily, Ort hodox, very rel i gi ous . 
She ha d a br other and a s i ster, bot h 
of them who died in Worl d War II.
  The  sister wa s deport ed, the  
brot her  die d in la bor  c a m p.  Her  e ntir e fa mil y fro
m Vacz  wer e, wa s de por ted t o Ausc hwitz  a nd die d  
there .  My mother ne ve r had t o
 wor k, basic ally, my father was 
alwa ys making enough mo ney and 
she  enj oyed j ust bei ng a hous e wi fe.  Anyt hing el se ? 
 

Q:  Did you say how ma ny brothers
 and s i sters  your  fa ther ha d?  
 

A:  My fat her  had t hirtee n brothe rs 
a nd s i sters , yes, a nd he wa s the ol
dest one to s urvi ve , t o gr ow up,  
beca use his older brot her  died, ve
r y e arly.  So, the  burden of s upp
orti ng the fa mi ly was  alwa ys o n  
hi m.  So he wa s the pr ovider t y
pe a n d my mot he r  ha d no bas i c re
sponsi bi lity.   She  was basic ally 
what you would call a  petit-bourgeoi
s lady and I always admired my 
father™s values more than my  
mother ™s but  that  does n™t  me an I di
dn™t love my mother. 
 My mother also surv
ived the war with me. 
 

Q:  How di d your fat her
 and your mothe r  me et?

A:  My father and mother met, so that, my father
 was worki ng for a wholesal
e dr ug di s t ributi on fir m.  
By dr ug I, we  mea n a  
cos met ic suppl y fir m, but i n Hunga ry 
t hey were  calle d druggists , ma ki ng 
cologne wat er, t hings li ke that .  It  ha d nothi ng to
 do wit h what we cal l dr ugs
 today.  It wa s not a  
pharmaceutical comp any.  And my , 
at that ti me, in Hungar y and i n
 Eu rope, it was the custom of 
middle-class families to se
nd their daughters to secretarial sc
hool and then have 
them work for a 
fe w year s for some fir m,  
hopi ng t hat they™ r e going to cat ch a 
hus ba nd.  And my 
mother caught m y  
fat her  ther e, which was very much
 to the dislike of he
r fami ly becaus
e my father , they felt, wa s 
much below their class and 
they made hi m feel that 
wa y in all  his li fe.  Of cours e, I ca nnot reall y  
say what would have ha ppe ne d a f
ter World War II because my mot h
er™s entire famil y was wiped  
out , pr actic al ly.  Onl y a few pe opl e 
who li ve d in Buda pest  re mai ne d. 
 So, but  I resent ed t hem for a 
very si mple r eason, t hat t hey l o
oked down on 
my father who I t hought wa
s a, was a very, wa s a man 
of integrity and, and hard-w
orki ng, a  good hu man being. 
 
Q:  We re t he y, how di d the y t r eat you a s a child?  

 

A:  I had a very strange re lati ons hip wi th my mot her™ s
 fa mily, especially my gr
andparents because they 
wer e very re ligious  and I  was  born 
irreligious and whenever
 I had to visit wi th them they forc ed me  
to wear a hat  even i n the mi ddle of
 the summer and eat a cert ai n kind of ver y strict kosher food, go 
to the s ynagogue every night a nd pr
a y and, a nd i n  gener al, t he y cons
idere d  me s o me ki nd of a , what 
they call in Yiddish a 
shaygets
, somebody who i s kind of j us t  an
 outsi der  because I never really 
we nt al ong wit h thei r, w
ith their religious rules.  I also rese
nted the fact t hat 
my gra ndmot her wa s 
kind of a, of a, of a very angr
y pe rson.  I felt t hat , that t he wa y 
she t reated others and t he way she 
treated my grandfather, I  resent ed t hat.  I didn™t 
li ke to go t her e and my mother , of course, al ways  
wa nte d me t o go and vi si t and I ha ve, I just fi nally  decide d to t ake my re ve nge s o I would not have  

to visit anymore.  And one day, th
is  was , I mu st  have be en a bout eleve n or so, I went  to a butche r  
shop, got a huge ha m hoc k 
and got out and when the 
people went to the syna
gogue Friday night, I 
was eating it with
out  a hat a nd pret ty soon they were re po
rting it to her and th
ey we re coming and 
that was my last visit .  They i m me di at ely sent  me  
back to Budapest and I neve
r  ha d t o visit a gai n.   
 

Q:  Wa s your mother  a ngr y wit h you?  

 

A:  Ye s.  My mo ther wa s  very 
a ngr y, but my fa ther and I, we
 al wa ys had s o me kind of  a n 
underst anding.  Even whe n he sc ol
de d me for some thing that , that 
had something to do with religion  
to g o alo ng wit h my mo t h
er, I  se nse d  in hi s voice  
that it was not serious, th
at he just did it for my 
mother ™s s ake.  And I als o
 found out since , bet we en 1948 and 195
0, I went  to Israel
, I was in Israel  
which we will come back later, 
when I came back and I spoke He
brew, I realize th
at my father 
doe sn™t  know how t o pr ay, that  he  j ust mu mbl es  
the words.  He  ha s no i d
ea, what really, how to 
even pronounce them an
d he did this all for, fo
r the love of my, m
y, my  
mother  and I  appreci ated 
this, that he put up this pretense but it was an in
t eresti ng di sc over y for me, that .  So he ne ver , he  
never really scol ded me a nd he was pr acticall y infl ue
ntial after the war to put 
down his foot and s ay, 
forget about kosher anymore, let™s 
j ust eat what  is available.  An d so we did not ha ve a kosher  
house hol d a nymore. 
 

Q:  No w was  y o ur fa ther™ s e ntire fa
mil y not  ver y reli gious, then?

A:  Ye s, y e s , the y were n™t.  T hey we re Je ws , th ey 
never, they neve r doubt t hei
r Je wishne ss.  The y kne w  
they wer e J ews but t he y were se cular Je ws , you 
know?   And int eres tingly, qui te a fe w of the m  
survi ved because of 
the place wher e t hey li ved.  Since they 
li ved in a Prol etarian tenement ofŠcit y 
tene me ntŠt hat wa s give n to people under a ce rt
ain i nc o me who ha d t oo 
many children and not 
enough i ncome, t here, the Communi s
t Party, the illegal Communist Pa
rty had a very strong hold on 
this ar ea a n d whe n, the n, t he Worl d War I I  ca me
 and the Nuremburg laws
 and e v erythi ng els e, 
some of t hese Communist leader s,
 Communist members, 
came and act uall y  re
scue d me mbers of t he  
fa mi ly.  I have a n uncl e in Hungar y and he , fo
r exa mple ,  was a ver y  good frie nd of a past 
Communist pri me mi nist er who j ust 
died r ecently because t hey practi
cally lived side by side.  So a  
great  deal of the Hungari an leader
ship, Communist leadersh
i p , ca me  fr om this  te ne me nt.  So that  
helped re scue the m.  The Communists  were t he onl y, 
the only group you c o uld 
re ally t ur n to, during 
thos e te rribl e  ye ars that , 
t hat woul d he lp you. 
 
Q: So, was religion main
ly only rec ogniz ed i n your h
ous ehold on holi days, or  . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.  Ye s.  My, my father always ta lked t o
 me and sa id go, you know, 
to the syna gogue, your  
mother want s you to go and all thi s
 and t hat , but  he ne ver r e ally di
d a nyt hing to forc e me to do 
wh ate ver wit h religi on .  He ju st
 as ke d me to res p ect my mot h er™s
 wi shes a nd s o I had Bar Mit z va h 
and that was the last thing that 
I did.  After my Bar Mitzvah I 
neve r pr oba bly we nt to synagogue  
agai n unl ess  it was a t o urist attr acti on, I j ust , wante d
 to se e  what it is, i nside.  And, but I ne ver  
deni ed my J ewi shnes s s o  whe n my
 gr andchil dre n espe ciall y a s k me  
about religion, I 
sa y I am  a Je w 
but  I™ m not  J e wi sh.  And they 
ask me , ﬁHow can that be?ﬂ An
d I said, ﬁWell, it™s easy.ﬂ  
 

Q:  Did you have any sort
 of, any sense of faith?  
 

A:  No, not re all y.  It™s a stra nge t hing that I ha
ve ne ver been some body who 
believes in the supreme  
being and so maybe, eventuall y, my
 lot, this is going to be diff
i cult , but beca use  the y  say pe opl e  
who have fa ith, t hey die  much easi e
r than the ones who don™t, but 
I al ways j ust associat ed wit h 
people who practically felt 
the sa me wa y and it never c aus ed any pr
oblems so far in 
my life, in my 
sixty-six yea r s.  But I c an™t re me mb
er when I r eally honestl y bel ieved
 in a supreme be
ing.  And the n  
of c our se , t h e war  pr oba bly wi pe
d out, i f I  had any doubts .  
 

Q:  Will you say some thing about yo
ur r el ationshi p wit h your fa ther ? 
 

A: Myrelationshipwith 
my fat her was al ways very
 good.  I [indecipherable]
, I consider ed hi m al ways 
my , my e x a mp l e, my  he r
o, a nd I was  very very upset when i n  
1942, he wa s take n a way and se nt to  
a labor c a m p in Yugosl a via.
  And when he  ca me  bac k i n 194
5, he , of course, I was  overwhel me d  
and in my me mo ry t oo ,  even th ou g h I spent mo re 
time with my mother, a 
lot more than with my 
fat her because he was al so a tr aveli n g salesman for a long t i me and I onl y
 saw hi m on weekends, 

so me ho w my me mor y is  much mo re blurr e d wh e n it 
comes to my mother than when it comes to my  
fat her .  My mother , one  reason it  
might be that my mother died in 
1970 and my father
 died in 1980 , 
so he sur
vived ten more years and 
since we lived in Eu rope from ™74 
on, at least for six years I had a  
lot more contact with him than I wo
uld have i f I had st aye d i n the U.
S.  I always consi dered hi m an 
absolute statue of integrity and,
 and hone sty and he was a lways lo
oki ng out for my i nte rests and I ,  
eve n though whe n I a s a n Americ an, ha d a ver y 
nice l i vi ng, I  made  a ver y
 ni ce li ving and I didn™t  
need any, any material, he
 was still saving and collecting things
 for us in Hungar
y and was alway s

givi ng us a l ot of t hings when we
 we nt to visit hi m a nd we ke pt 
telli ng hi m t hat he shoul d spend it  
on hi ms el f.  He , he was j ust on
e of t h e most unsel fis h pe opl e 
I have ever met in my life . 
 
Q:  And you felt  this  wa y fr om the  
ti me  t hat you were
 a small  chil d– 
 

A:  Ye s, al way s , al wa ys .  He  was al ways t hat  wa y. 
 Just a  very si mple , ve
ry  si mp le  man .  Ve r y,  
extremely intelligent, uneducated bu
t a true human being.  And wi
th my mother, 
I always had a 
little bit of my doubts that
 she™s not as straightfo rw
ard as my fa ther.  And th
ere were little incidents 
that ki nd of, as a chi l d, it™ s a mazi
ng how it get s engraved 
i n your mind and you can
not get rid of it . 
And the thi n g that I wa s very, ve ry
 bi tter about , that I coul d ne ver fo
r give my mot her for, was t hat  
while my father was in 
concentration camp 
in Yugoslavia, she 
took a little job and 
she worked for a 
drugstore in the center of
 Buda pest .   And next to t he dr ugstor
e wa s an a ntique store.  Mr . Kl ein wa s 
the name of the man who 
owned and he liked my mo
ther.  My mother was a 
cute little creature and 
ever ybody liked her and so he woul d wait for her wh
en she closed this shop to escort her home  
beca use he l i ved t he sa me wa y and I didn™t s ee  a
nyt hing wrong wit h this, but the y notic ed how 
jealous I  am of my mother
 and it™ s not that I wanted t o posses
s my mot her , I j ust , I wa s pr otecti ng  
my  mot her  for my  fat her and  so  
he  put his ar m ar ound 
my  mot her a nd  the y wer e  lo oki n g at me  a nd  
laughing at how a nnoye d I bec a me 
and this picture is constantly 
i n my mi nd.  And I coul d ne ve r  
forgive my mother for this, that, 
that she did not realize how hurt I 
was by playing this silly game. 
And she was, still she wa
s a good person, she did 
everything possibl
e to give me a 
good educatio n 
and, but, she had a very petit-b
ourgeois thinking and another thi
ng that somehow st
ood between the 
two of us  wa s pia no.  She  deci de d that  I™ m going t o
 be a gr eat pi ano pla yer a nd I  de cide d that I ha ve 
no int eres t  in playi ng t he piano an
d s h e woul d someti mes get so annoye d tha t  I did not pr actice t hat  
she would ta ke a rug-be a t er and r
un a fte r me and try to be at me but
 I was much fa ster than she was  
so we were running around the ta
ble and t hen eventually she just
 br oke down and 
cried that she 
coul dn™t catc h me but she  had this 
obs ession with, wit h, with pi ano pl
ayi ng and s o a gain, ever sinc e  
in Worl d War II, our pi ano wa s des t roye d.  We  
gave it t o s o mebody for sa fekeepi n g and the y  
claimed that the, the bomb got it, 
whatever , I was glad.  She wanted 
to buy anot her  pia n o a nd I  sai d  

no.   Wh en I, when we came up fr om the cellar afte
r liberati on, I sai d, that™s 
it.  I a m now a  ma n.  I  
basic a lly re s c ue d my mother mor e
 than once duri ng World War II a
nd I s aid no more piano and I  
never s at down to play
 the pi ano.  Ne ver. 
 I  neve r had the urge . 
 

Q: You talked a little bit a
bout your relationship with
 your mother™s fa mily 
and I was interested in  
heari ng your  relati onshi p wit h your fat her™s  fa mil y. 
 

A:  My fat h er™ s  fa mi l y  wa s my  fav o
rite side of the fa m
i l y.  I ha d a 
gr andmother, a typic al Pr oletar ia n 
woma n wit h  thirtee n chil dren a nd not  mu ch of 
a hus ba nd.  And I re me mber
 going out and lovin g  
ever y mome nt of s pendi ng ti me wit h the m bec a
use here I  ca me, I was the , the ,  the sec ond 
grandchild in the fa mily.  There 
was one older one who, 
unfortunately, during th
e war, was killed. 
So  I wa s kind of the sweetheart of
 e v erybody and the y wer e pa mperi n
g me and t aki ng me  to pl aces 
and my grandmot her, I r e me mbe r , ha d a tre mendous
 knowledge of how to ma
ke beans in at least  
fi ft een di ffer ent ways.  There were 
be ans e very ti me I we nt out,  th
e y ha d bea ns, bea ns , but s he was  
just a  mar vel ous  woma n, a ver y 
war m -heart e d, a t ypic a l c ount r y woma n.  She  ca me  fr om s out her n  
Hungary fr om a very small village and after raising 
thirteen children during the 
day, she left them in 
the car e of my father and the n went
 fr om door t o  door selli ng silk st
ocki ngs just to add a little bit t o 
the, t o the income.  The, 
my father™s brot hers and sisters were, of
 course , s o me of th
em are only j ust

a fe w ye ars older  than I a m
, so the y wer e al most  like  br other s 
and sist ers to me at t h at ti me an d 
since t her e was no money at all in 
the family, they resorted to some
how, ill egal t hings . I  re me mber I 
love d ice skating a nd the y said, oh no probl e m a n d 
they t ook a huge scisso
rŠpair of scissorsŠand 
cut a big hol e and pus he d me t hro
ugh the hole into the ice skating 
rink, nearby, so we  always  went 
ice skating.  A lot of things were
 s olved not by ve ry le ga
l ways, but as a child, th
is was life to me. 
The r e were a lot of chil dren in t he tene me nt constantl y hor si ng around a nd nobody, nobody was  
constantly bothering me an
d, a nd, and dis cipli ni ng me a nd get
ting a he ad or  goi ng t o the  synagogue, 
nothing.  It wa s a great freedom and 
I jus t e njoye d it  ver y ver y much. 
 

Q:  Did you have a particularly
 cl ose  rel at i ons hip wit h any of your  father™ s s i bli n gs?  
 

A:  An y of my  father™s brothers or sisters? 

 

Q:  M mm- h m m.  

 

A:  Let™s  se e, di d I?  No, I  re ally ha
d a  ve ry, ver y good rel ations hi p with
 all of them, with
 practicall y all  
of the m.  And I  ca nnot really sa y 
that one or the other, I liked on
e partic ularly and i n teresti ngl y, I 
spent the least time with him.  He 
wa s a, just ki nd of a ver y outstanding figure, a tall , ve ry masc ular  
[si c ] man who went to Cze chosl ova kia during th
e War, Wo rl d War II and 
so me ho w wo rke d  for a  
shoe fact or y, which was a ver y fa mo us s hoe fact or
y all over t he wor l d, Ba
ta, got ma rri ed t here an d 
came once t o visit us and I  stil
l remember his visit.  
I was s o  i mpres se d wit h hi m, wi th hi s, t here  
wa s just a n a i r about thi s ma n tha t  i mpres sed me 
a  great deal a nd, unfort unat
ely, whe n t here was t he  
big upri sing, there wa s a big Slov
a kia n uprisi ng a g ainst t he Ger ma ns 
i n 1944, a nd he wa s an office r  
in the, in this uprising,
 in the Partisa n Ar my, a nd t hey c aught
 hi m a nd he was ha nge d.  So, we kne w  
this for sure because his wife surv
ived the war, he was a Gentile an
d he has two children living in 
Switzerl and toda y.  One ,  I™ m sor r y, one, t he other  
one  is a ste pbr othe r.  He has  one a n d I met hi m 
and s o I kne w the st ory.  But, t h
is, this was the man who, to me, 
was an outst anding repre sent ativ e  
of my fat her ™s side of fa mil y.  But , t oda y, t her
e a r e onl y t wo me n and one  wo
me n [si c . ] l e ft  o f t h e  
thirteen.  I mean, they™re in their 
late seventies, so, but on my moth
er ™s side, no br othe rs, no br othe r,  
no si ster , pr acticall y.  I onl y ha ve one cousi n le ft
 on my mother ™s si de in Budape st toda y.  He™ s  
younger t ha n  I a m, so, t ha t™s. 
 

Q:  What  were  your , did you have partic ul ar int eres t s 
a s a  chil d or  s pecial  things  that  you li ke d t o do?  
 

A:  I wa s an a v id cyc list .  I love d to, I love d to
 bicycle.  I woul d come
 home fr om school a nd 
i mme diat ely take off a nd go, t here was a big par k , we 
li ve d ne ar the, t he , we li ved on the Pest si de  
and there was a so- called rose gard
en in t he center of Pest and th
at™ s wher e I met wit h  my friends 
ever y a ft ernoon.  And we 
were comp aring our bicycles.  Bicycles
 wer e the same as
 cars today for 
us.  I mean, it was, it was a thin
g and we a d mire d t he one who had 
t he c ust om- made one or ha d just 
even custom- made par ts, and so
 we had big races on bicycle an
d t hen t hat was it, so I was 
heart broke n when in 194
4, one of t h e first  thi ngs  we had to 
take in when the Germans occupied 
Hungary wa s the bic ycle  and the ra di o.  And I los t  it.
  I also belonged to 
a n undergrou
nd Boy Sc out 
group, I was an avid u
nderground Boy Scout .  Th
e reason I say undergrou
nd bec ause we  couldn™t  
be lega l Boy Scouts.  The Boy Sc out  mo ve me nt, 
whi ch was based on br
ot herhood and equalit y of 
all, decl ared that  Jews are not
 equal a nd t her e f ore all Je wish Boy Sc out or gani za tions  were 
disbanded a nd Je ws wer e also thr o wn out of those 
Boy Scout groups that  we

some Je wish school  or  
something.  I belongedto the so-called Three-Hu

Hundred Te n J oka y M ór  Boy Sc out  
group.  Joka y Mór wa s a fa mous 
Hungarian wri t er, a hu mani st.  
He was n ot Je wish but h e  was a h u ma nist .  An d 
we met illegally, 
sometime s in th
e base me nt of  
synagogues and then we had to sp
lit up later into smaller groups a
nd it was in, in homes, in one, the 
small groups consisted of about te
n, between ten and fourteen people
 and s o we just  rot ated and did  
all ki nds  of t hings, be side s hiking, we wer e build
i n g model ai rplanes  and di

usually do, other wis e.  I have al ways, always  dr
e a mt t he se days, I ha d al wa

hool , I just  looked at 
my classmates who were,  
of c our se, Christia ns  and could wear t he uni for m a

Q:  Did you attend a secular school? 

 

A:  Yes, I have always at tended a 
secular school , excep
t  my fi rst  fo urt h gra d es 
were in a, the Jewish  
orphanage r a n a sc hool, it  was bas i
call y a sec ular s chool, but t h e Je wi
sh or phanage was i n charge i n 
order  to ha ve enough mone y t o rai s e the  or pha ns
.  So the or pha ns li ve d in a dor m w hile we  who 
were coming fro m the outside, we
 had t o pay tui tion.  And i t  wa s 
near by, I spent  four  year s t here 
and t he n, mi ddle sc hool.  I we nt t o
 a secular  stat e school, mi ddl e sc
hool because it was exactly next 
door to my house .  And 
then, of c o urse , ca me  t he– 1944, 
and 1943- 44, I c oul dn™t go t o hi gh  
school .  The r e™s one inci dent i n 
my middle school that I felt had ve
ry, ve ry i mportant conseque nce s  
for the rest of my li fe.  We were, 
as basicall y innocents abr oad, to 
the point where I really didn™t pa y 
much att enti on to being J ewi sh or not  Jewi sh until  
this inci dent  happene d.  In fi fth gr ade, it wa s an 
art class and my art teacher wa
s drawi ng s o mething on t h e black
boar d and we had to copy i t , 
exactl y.  And the n col or it exactl y.  And he c a me by 
and for s o me reas on, I us

 whic h wa s not unusual in t hose

Mr. Holczer, I was just

and all thi s s o I ran home .  I menti one d be for e  that
 I lived next to the sc hool .  The ot her house was  
where we li ved, apart ment house. 
 And I ra n up t o my 
mo the r ™s, i nt o my  mo ther ™s ar ms  a nd  as ke d 
her to cle an me up and c o me and ba
sically what I wanted is justice,
 I c oul d not, e ven at  the age of  
eleve n, I couldn™t belie ve  that t his 
is  going to be t h e way it i s.  And 
I wa nte d her  to c o me in a nd do  
something about it. 
 An d after sh e cleaned me  
up she said, ﬁNow you mu
st underst a nd, a l ot of  
things t hat  you cannot u
nder sta nd now, I cannot  go 
i n and do anythi ng, ye
s, except  a pol ogiz e for  
your behavi or.ﬂ  And I s aid, ﬁ What , what be havi
or, what did I do, used th
e wrong c ol or,ﬂ a nd s h e  
said, ﬁ We ll, you don™t underst and 
just  now.ﬂ  [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left  out was 
a very i mportant thing.  
The teacher was yelling at me
 as I was running out of 
the class, ﬁI hope you  
go to Palestine to sell oran
ges.  That™s where you be
long.ﬂ  An d so wh en I to
ld my mother, this is 
wh en her reaction came .  So  sh e came back to sch
ool wit h me  and ins t ea d 
of dema nding some kind 
of a reme dial action for this, apol ogi zed to the teac
her .  And I  thought  tha t  was , t hat wa s a  ve ry  
strange t hing.  I di dn™t underst and at t hat ti me .  I 
did understand it, years late
r, that this was the only 
course she could, she 
could take.  Obviously, she 
was afraid that maybe th
ey will kick me out of 
school i f s he  does somet h
ing el se.  And e ver y J ewi sh fa mil y, of
 course, wa nted to have their son 
fi nis h middl e  school .  And t hat 
incident some how fr ustrat ed me to the point, it created a me ntal  
bloc k.  I ne ver dr e w or never pai nte d in my li fe  
since.  I am such idiot 
when it comes to, to do 
anyt hing wit h my hands that i nvolves  dra wi ng or  pa
inting that it is pathetic
.  Whe n we  pla y s o me  
ga mes , for e xa mpl e, wi t h my frie nds , whe n I  ha ve 
to draw something, they 
can™t believe that, they  
think my perception is 
t h at of a me nta lly ret arde d pers on and it  is
, it is just a, just 
a  bl ock.  Howeve r,  
I appr eciat e art ver y much.  I neve
r fail to go and see an exhibit of
 pai nti ngs and dra wings .  I j us t  
don™t want t o do it and I cannot do 
it mysel f .  Now it™s possi
ble that t his c an be unl oc ked in ti me but 
by that  ti me  I won™t be al ive. 
 So, I rather just  leave this. 
 
Q:  Did you father care
 about  this  i ncident ? 
 
A:  No , my  fath er was  n ot a r ou nd  a
nymore.  He heard it after the wa
r and of course by that ti me, I  
coul d, I unde rstood the  whole  sit uati o n better .  
 
Q:  Was t hat  the fir st i nstan
ce of anti -Semi tism t hat– 
 

A:  –Hi t  me for the fi rst ti me? We
ll, the first one, I re
me mb er wa s whe n I wa s si x a nd I wa s p l ayi n g  
mar ble s wit h, with kids and I wo
n.  And one ki d said, t hre w the ma
r ble down the gutt er and s aid  
ﬁI™d rather throw it down the gutter than to give
 it to a Jew.ﬂ  And I we nt home a nd asked my  
mother, ﬁ What, what does it mean?ﬂ 
So, t hat r eall y was the first  ti me  
that something like
 this hit me.  
And sinc e I  we nt t o a  Je wi
sh school  for t he fi rst f
our ye ars, I wa s not r eall y e xpose d t o  thi ngs  like  
this.  But the minute I 
s witc he d a nd in fi ft h gra de, eve r yt hi
ng starte d.  Luc kil y, t her e were some  
teachers of course, in our  
school  who tried t
o make 
up for  thi s.  And I reme mber a couple of t hem.  
Unfort una tel y, t he y™re  not alive a nymore but  they di
d eve r yt hi ng possi ble t o, t o ma ke  our li fe  a  bit  
more civili ze d.  And one of t he m was  eve n fir ed 
be caus e of t hat .  But no
t everybody was like this. 
 

Q:  He  was  fire d be cause he  wa s . . .  

 

A:  He was ver y prote ctive of, of Je
wi sh c hildre n and he wa s al so fire
d bec aus e we ha d a  spe cial s ubj ect  
called, how would I , how would I translat e this , De

so re volti ng as far a s Hungary™
s neighbors were concerned.  Fo
r exampl e, the 
Roma nians were 
descr i be d as  mo nkeys on a, on a tre e, their intell
e ctual le vel a nd, I me an, for ever y nat i onalit y that  
surr ounde d Hungary, t h ey had a  ve
ry derogatory term.  And, actua
lly, t he  book was  prepari ng you  
that one day we will get even.  An
d what he was, among other things
, he was teaching
 this subject ,  
and he said, ﬁPut the book
 away and let me tell you 
what  li fe  is about .ﬂ  
And it  was  a ve ry, very 
huma n, humanisti c lec ture tha t he would gi ve us
 e ver y da y.  And, a ft er the  war , to our great  
satis fa ction, but not s urprise, he
 was  na me d as t he fir st dire ctor
 of the Hungarian Academy of 
Physic al Sci ence s, so, he , they r ec o
gnized hi m.  And he was t h en, I ta
l ke d t o hi m later  a nd he was i n 
the Illegal Social Democratic Party,
 so that also helped hi m.  But ,
 there were teac her s and I ha d a 
teacher, I don™t even know
 i f he had any political  convi ction,
 but he was a human bei ng and he 
always tried to mitigate any law, 
anything, but, but as a 
child, for example, ev
en, even in middle 
school , I ha d to go onc e a we ek to t h ree hours of, of
 l abor, bat t alion prac ti ce.  This wa s one of the  
most hu mili ating e xpe rie nces that a nybody ca n ha ve.  They ha d the scum
 of earth in ch
arge of us, it 
wa s not tea chers or any– we ha d t o repor t eith
er at school  or some where on the outski rts of  
Budapest to a practice ground wher e these hir e d in
str uctors that wer e a lot wor se than any dril l  
instr uctor  I have ever  seen in an
y mo vie, any Ameri
can movie, becaus
e i t ™s  not  that , 
it was not just 
the physical , the physical  abuse can be tolerat ed, bu
t it is the mental abuse, 
but t hat was so, so bad, 
the way the y  called us e v erythi ng, a J ewi sh thi s a n d 
a  Je wi sh that, an
d t hes e wer e people  hired to do 
this j ob a nd besi des  of mar chi ng
 and, and diggi ng and buil d ing, c o
nstantly, we were abused and 
constantly even physically
 so.  Ma ny ti me s they b
eat us and al l this.  And we had t o go there a bout  
three hours on a certain day.  Th e 
Christians then we nt to three ho
urs  of pr a ctice of what  you woul d 
call today ROTC.  They had, th
ey had marching drill practices
 and all this.  But ours was 
compl etel y different . 
 

Q:  What ye ardi
d t hat start? 
 
A:  Wh at year? We ll, I was in fi ft h 
grade, right, so it was 
a bout 1940 whe n I  e ntere d t he middle  sc hool.  
It was  about 1940. 
 
Q:  By t hat ti me , ha d any of the an
ti-Jewish legislation, 
I know there wer e a fe
w things t hat Hungar y  
had adopted, was that affec
ting your fa mil y at all?  
 

A:  We ll, ye s, i n  a se ns e, t hat  some  pe opl e  in t he 
fa mi ly, suc h a s  my a unt , wh
o was  ver y young, one of 
my fat her™ s sisters, and, was marri
ed also to a young, t w
ent y- one  or twent y-t wo yea r  old ma n.  He  
was called up to go to th
e east ern front and, and he go int o la
bor battalions, in ™41,
 I™m talking about 
™41 bec aus e that™s whe n Ger ma n y 
declared war, Ger many att acked 
the Soviet Union. 
 I mme diat ely , 
the ver y young, I t hink t we nty- one
 old J ewish men wer e c all ed up. 
 They had to go
 to a cert ain 
place i n thei r own cl othes.  They di dn™t get any 
uni for
m, anythi ng, and t ake
n to the easter n front 
i mme diat ely for mi ne, got to, to pic k up mines ,  
okay? And many of them
 without any previous 
experience a nd, a nd, and any s chooli n g as to how to 
do it, of course , ble w up. 
 Now, the reason I a m 
me ntioni ng this beca use  my fath
er™s  sister who wa s ver y young 
and ma rried to 
a young ma n, 
interestingly, when he was taken 
to t he fr ont , for  some  rea son, so
me body made a mis t ake and hi s  
unit  was  iss u ed Hungaria n ar my uni for ms .  
 

Q:  This is her husband?

A:  Her husba nd, ye s, oka y.  And he
 then we nt to t he phot ogra pher fo
r s o mething and just ha d a pi ctur e  
taken, proudly posing in a 
Hungarian military uniform, he sent
 home.  By the 
time, the picture  
arrive d at  home, he  was  dea d.  He wa s bl own up 
on a mi ne.  And this  pi
ct ure i niti ated a whol e 
avalanche of events in ou r family because my aunt
 who was a n extre mel y shre wd pers on, used this  
pictur e to sta r t, to ba sic – de clari ng hers el f firs
t as ha l f-Je wi s h, which wa s an exc epti onal position 
then.  And a s the Nure mbur g la ws
 were ti ght ened more and more 
so, she  took one 
more step and  
one more step and one more st ep i n
 pushi ng t his whole i dea t hat she™
s not really under this categor y  
of the Nurembur g laws.  
And it, t he whole t hing acceler ated to 
the poi nt where th
e last, when the 
onl y way s h e coul d be declare d an e xce ptional perso
n, a s the y we re call e d, whi c h me ans that you™ re  
not consi der ed J e wis h, was t o ta ke my gr andmot he
r down to the police statio
n and t hat  was a scene 
I re me mber:  her t aki ng my gr andm
other down a nd my gr andmot her 
had to, under oath, sign a n  
affidavit t hat  she i s an, she was an ill egiti mat e 
chi l d be cause my gr and mother wa s cle aning hous e  
for a l a wyer , a Christian lawyer
 who was dea d by t hat ti me , a 
bac helor.  And she  s i gne d t his  
affidavit which made her a, a Ch
ristian.  And with a hu
sband who died in m
ilitary uniform, so he 
wa s obvi ous l y a  Chri stia n, wit h he
r  mother  si gni ng t his  a f fi davit t h
at she was illegitimate, and the 
fat her  was a Chr i stian, she practical
ly cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family. 
And, a s I mentione d to you be fore
, she di d an e xcelle nt job up until 1944, October , that was the  
poi nt where nobody coul d 
do anything anymore be
cause hell broke  loose  in Hungar y a n d the s cum 
of eart h, the worst ele me nts, t he s o-ca lled Arrow 
Cross Part y took over and ruled fr om Oct ober 15
th
 
until  Ja nuary 18
th
 when Pest wa s liberated. 
 

Q: Back in the begi
nnings of the war, when ther
e were, did your, di
d your family expe
rience economic 
hardshi ps when there we
re economic restricti o
ns on Jewish . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.  Obviously, ever ybody e
xpe rienced this  beca use  the  me n wer e
 a wa y a nd t her e wer e ve ry, ver y  
fe w e mpl oyers who would f
eel obli gated to compensa
te the fa mil y.  And so 
a lot of people were 
actuall y e ither star ving, or the mot h er ha d t o go 
and look for a job, or i f
 t he chil dren were ol d 
enough, t he y  had t o go a nd work a n
d do s o met hi ng.  We we r e  in a 
ver y good positi on, my mot her  
and I , for a whi l e, because my fat h
er ™s e mpl oye r fel t  obli gat e d to se
nd us part of his re gular mont hl y 
salar y, so we  di d get money. 
 

Q:  Let™s  c o me  back to that  a nd fi
rst, if you wo uld, tell 
me  how your father wa
s take n away and when? 
 

A:  Okay, my father was taken away
 se veral ti mes .  You know, Hungar
y wa s kind of a s t range part of 
that Nazi area because the Hungar
ians, the Hunga r ian gover n me nt ha
s al wa ys be en i n the ha nds of 
the arist ocracy, Hungarian ari stocr
acy, and the Hungari an arist ocracy 
ha d no ta ste for  Je ws but a l so  
had no t aste for kill ing or  murde r in
g J ews.  They wer e above t his, an
d so therefor e when the dictat or  
of Hungar y, Admi ral Hor t hy, ha d t o
 a ppoint a  governme nt, mo st of 
t he ti me  that governme nt would 
not e vent ual ly do e ver yt hing that t he  Ger ma ns want
ed them to do.  So it was almost like playing  
musica l chai rs, I mean, Hu
ngary™ s a  very small country a nd you 
don™t ha ve that ma ny politi cians, 
aristocrats to go around, but al mo
st t h e sa me  fac es some how a ppe ared
, i f  not as  pri me  mi nister  then 
ma ybe mi nis t er of inter i or, or 
so methi ng.  So we r eally, up unt il 
1944, we had a great deal of a nti-
Semiti sm, we had a great  deal of 
persecution of Jews but 
we were not i n fe ar 
of our lives. Bec aus e 
some how t h at wa s bel o w the di gnit y 
of that cla ss.  Not onl y that , 
so me of t hose ari stocr ats wer e  
very Anglophiles a
nd had, during the war, conn
ections with the British. 
 And so in between, it  
depended on which aristocrat was in
 charge of the country.  Some 
of them were a little bit more  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

Ger ma n- orie nted than ot hers .  And when, a nd more
 Ger ma n- o riente d c a me  int o t he pict ure bec aus e  
the Ger mans didn™t like t he one who wa
s in office, then he ordered that
 s o and so i s 
going to go and 
serve in, these Jews will be
 taken to the labor 
battalion.  My fa ther was in
 the labor battalion before 
he was  take n to Yugosl a via but he was inside Hu
ngar y s o we  could visit hi m, we  could ta ke food 
for hi m and eventuall y, when a ne
w pri me mi nist er ca me , he declar
ed that  anybody 
over let™s say,  
forty-five can go home.  So there was no fe ar of being killed just
 because you are, yo
u™re a Jew.  Up  
until 1944, March, wh
en the Germans ma rc
hed into Hungary. 
 
Q:  So  when your father was 
called to be taken away . . . 
 

A:  To go, yea h, we  kne w where he
 was.  I reme mber, he was not fa
r fr om Buda pest  for  awhile , for a  
fe w mont h, and t he n al most e very 
we eke nd we t o ok food down, we ta
l ke d to hi m, he was relea se d, 
we could walk around a little bit. 
 And so it was not the same thin
g as taken away to a faraway 
country where we had no idea what w
oul d ha ppen to hi m.  
Now, ther e, t here, th
en i n 1942, he was  
take n a wa y for, for  good
.  For some  reason, and 
I  cannot  re all y re me mbe r  exactl y what  ha ppe ne d 
and why.  We ha d, proba bly, a more
 r adical  pri me  mi nister  who yie l
de d t o the Ger ma n
s and let this  
conti ngent of J ewish l abor batt alions go outsi de th
e countr y and he was t he n take n to Yugosla via.  I  
re me mber, e ven then, the y, the y we
re told whi ch r ailroa d stati o n are the y going to be goi ng thr ough  
in Budape st and t hey allowe d the m 
t o  be ther e I think hal f an hour
 or an hour where we had a visit 
wit h hi m so we c oul d tal k over a fe w things.  And th
at was the last I saw hi m, t hen, for a couple of 
years until  he came 
back after the war. 
 

Q:  And he , whe r e di d he  go exactl y?  

 

A:  He  went  to , he wa s i n a cop per  mine  in  B or , B,
 O, R which is I think th
e nearest is Niı which is  
Serbia today, the Se
rb Republic in Yugoslavia. 
 And he  was  there , he wa
s always tell
ing me about 
wh at was , what was i nter estin g, t he v ariou s p eo pl e
 who gua rded the m.  They
 had Croat s, they had 
German, they was all SS, Croat, 
Croat i an SS, Ger ma n SS, Hungari an, not SS, but Hungaria n, a nd I  
think that they had some
thing, I™ ve forgot wha t, but a nyway, 
vari ous nati onalit ies wer e guardi ng  
the m a nd pr oba bly Bos n ians .  And he menti oned wh
en he c a me home , i n teresti ngl y, he sai d, ﬁ S on,ﬂ

much about  anyone el se

was.ﬂ  They called them 
Ust aıa s, you know.  He wa s there a n d I think, I, th
is is probably much be
tter written than in my

fi ft y thousand were in this pa

what happened was when, when t h

So, he was very bitter about

Q:  I would l i ke to as k, you wer e ju
st de scribi ng your, your fat he r™s ex
perience in Bor and I wonder i f 
when he was  taken a w ay to Bor i f that , you and yo
ur mother and yo
ur father  were re cognizing t hat  
this was going t o be t he  bi g one ,as it  wer e a nd i f you ca n re call  
that  se par ati on and what  happe ned. 
 

A:  We ll, o f c o urse we we re alwa
ys a fra id that he would not  survi ve and we had no doubt tha t  
physically he could survive 
but we were afraid that, that he wo
uld get killed.  But an interesting 
epis ode was that, [cough] exc use me , I asked hi m af
t er the war , what , why did he s urvi v e i f so many 
people died? And he had a little, ju
st a short little anecdote,
 he said, ﬁSon
, there were two kinds of 
people in the concentration camp
.  We  got a cant e e n of wat e r e v
ery morning.  The 
one group drank 
the wat er i m mediately and 
the second group, such 
as mysel f , dr ank hal f  of t he wat er dur i ng t he da y 
and we use d  the  ot her ha lf to wash oursel ves .ﬂ 
 And I  sai d, ﬁHal f a cant
een of water  woul d ma ke 
you cl ea n? ﬂ He sa id, ﬁ N o, but I fe lt like a huma n being, I wa s still caring about mysel f .ﬂ  And he  

said, ﬁ A nd l ater on I understood 
a lot more about this 
whol e at titude  that I™ m 
not going to lie down  
here and gulp down ev
erything, I am, even though
 I am full of lice, I™m st
ill caring about myself.ﬂ  
So that, basically, that wa
s the attitude that saved, 
I™m sure, that wa
s who survived.  
And of course 
luck, because even with this attit
ude somebody could have shot you 
if they didn™t like your fa ce or 
the wa y they moved.  Yes, we , my  
mother maintained of 
cour se li ke most  wive
s that  he™s goi ng to 
retur n, a nd she wa s ri ght be cause
 eve n though we ha ve not he
ard fro m hi m fo r a lon g ti me , 
especiall y the last year  when he 
was there, of course by that time
, we coul dn™t ha ve he ard fr om hi m 
because he was already 
in the liberated area and we
 were in Hungary 
still, in the battlefi
eld.  It was, 
however, just that, that deep 
feeling that he will 
come home. An
d he came home in 1945, I 
re me mb er la te spr i n
g, it  must have been April,
 M ay, pr oba bly, and he did 
not j ust stop by a nd sai d,  
ﬁHere I am.ﬂ   He was afraid that 
ma y be we wo ul d  fain t or 
something like that.  He sent a friend up. 
A ma n ca me  up a nd inquired a bout 
my fat her a nd very slowl y kind
 of aske d, ﬁ Whe n di d you hear  
fr om hi m? ﬂ and all thi s, and ﬁ Do you thi nk he™s a
live?ﬂ and all this
, a nd slowly he sa id, ﬁ Well , I  
have a feeli n g that he is alive,ﬂ 
and sl owl
y he led us to t his . I r e me mbe r  hi m c o ming up on t he s t air s  
wit h a rucksack.  The r ucksack 
was full of sausage and pot atoes. 
 An d  he kn e w t h at we we re 
starvi ng and so t hat  was i t
.  Now, just to describe
 t he situat ion i n Hungary 
a t  that  ti me  a nd how you 
nee ded to be , to sta y a huma n be
ing, t he, we di d not liv
e in our  apart ment , we
 were mo ved, because 
you c oul d not sta y i n your a part me n
t.  You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had 
a big star on them and, event uall y 
to the ghett o.  And beca use  of t h
e hist ory of t his house , we di d 
not move i nt o the ghet t o but this  
house Zichy str eet One,
 wa s de signate d  as a 
J e wish house  firs t.  
So, in the meanti me , we move d out of, of our a par
t me nt in, tha t  was 1944, s u mmer whe n you had to

leave your apartment.  We , the ne
ighbors came, some of 
them, and said ﬁWe will 
keep this for you,  
and keep t h is for you,ﬂ  and ne edle ss to sa y, that
 not one thing eventually survived again.  Or 
resur faced again.  They all, eit h
er t he Russi ans took i t , or the bo
mbing or eve ryt hi ng.  I t ™s al l  
disa ppe are d, and wha t  c oul d you do about it?   Yo
u sai d okay.  But pe ople wer e in a way li ke 
vult ures , the y were just circlin
g ar ound a nd s ee, you know, what 
the y c an take.  And then t he  
apart ment was gi ven, al l these Jewi sh apart men
ts were given to bom
b those people whose– 
Gentiles whose houses were bomb
ed and they couldn™t 
live in any more.  And I had no idea of 
course what happened to our ap

, and I , 
my fir st thi n g, we were l i berat ed on January 18 a nd 
the first thing I went ba
ck to see, wh at, wh at 
happened to our apartment because 
we le ft, beli eve it or not , a fe w bo
xes  of li ne n the r e, just whe n  
we le ft .  We  just, we couldn™t do anyt hing wit h 
it, so.  And when I ca me , when I went  up there , I 
had this tremendous 
chip on my  shoulder
 that I™m going to show th
ese peopl e whoever are there, 
that withi n t wo hours , I 
s aid I™ m going to gi ve the m t wo hours  
to get out of here.  And here I was a  
sixtee n year  old kid, ba r e ly si xtee n, fi ft een real
l y , and telli ng the m, her e
 wa s a fa mil y
 and I was  
telling them to get out of here.  
And the fa mily consisted of a mo
ther, father, a daughter and two 
sons.  And they were tailors.  
And the old man was quite
 old, the father, wa
s telling me, he said,  
ﬁBut, but, where can we 
go? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁ Why did 
you come  here? ﬂ  And he
 s aid, ﬁ We ll, we ha ve,  
we ha ve no place .  Our , our hous e was destr oyed, and 
I me an we knew that this
 is, this was a Jewish  
apartment, but still it wa
s between this or living in the street, 
in the cold snowy Ja

ﬁCoul d, c oul d you do s o met hing, c o uld, coul d we so
me ho w co me to s o me ki

And so my mother  came 
up and she said, ﬁ Why can™t we j ust
 divi de the place bet ween us?ﬂ And  
here it was a two room ap
artment with their fa mily, fo ur people, 
fi ve people in their families and 
two , my mo t her an d I, a n
d we deci de d that a fte r looking at the m
 and listening to them and all this, 
there was just something that all of
 a s udden hit me .  M y c hip was go

we  were  goi ng to, we™ll , we™ll  ma ke i t .  And s o 
we lived there under the sa

very good fri ends.  And when my
 fat her ca me home in lat e spring, the ne w gover n me nt , De mocra tic  
governme nt ,  devise d this  plan of eac h bloc k ha d to elect a ki nd of a s mal l council and the hea d of  

that council was quite

pty apart me n t or , al most  l i ke a J ustic e

t hat  they can per f or m, te mporarily

fat her wa s a ppointe d to do thi s be ca use he was a l
wa ys very much re spec ted by the pe ople t here a n d 
the fa ct t hat he wa s now good, y
ou know, with the ne w regi me.  A
nd ne xt  to us, an apart ment  was  
full of old, old wo men who die d one  aft er another . 
 It wa s a , l i ke a Sal vati on Ar my pla ce.  The y,  
they re nte d i t  and it be ca me e mpty, s o my father
 got the apart ment for t h
e m a nd they move d over 
there s o we coul d ge t our apart me nt bac k, we li ved 
the r e, but  they c oul d never reall y thank enough 
and we , we kept t his rela tions hi p for a long ti me 
and I™ m s orr y I lost cont act wit h the m.  But t hen , 

we ha d an apartment and then we faced so me thi
ng e l se bec ause  the n t h e Russ ians wer e co ming 
around and t rying to find places for their sol dier s  
and so t hey, they got , they got t wo old Russian 
soldi ers  from Si beria  who were qua r tered in, i n
 our apa rt me nt beca use  t wo rooms  were t oo many 
for three people.  So , and 
I remember, they we
re  very c ute  ol d me n, we had no, I mea n we ha d si gn  
langua ge, we didn™t spe a k Rus sia n and the  only i n ci
de nt I re me mber i s that  
my mother, of all these 
sufferings, had one little symbol in 
her possession: a bottle 
of very expensive co

kept .  And s he said, ﬁI a m going to s t art using thi s
 aft er the war, when we are all toget her and we

it with her all

 no w, wh en  we

Now one day we came home

 to her cologne water in the ar

Russia ns we re very hard presse d to get alcohol , a

  I mean, t here wer e  
stories that I  can™t beli eve, that 
t hey went to the museum and dran
k alcohol out of t he se scie nti fic  
lab experi me nts andŠi nc ludi ng e mbr yos Šbut I never believe d those stori es, but this i s true.  The y  
drank my mother ™s c ol o gne  water . 
 The y we re s o, so har d pr esse d 
for al c ohol.  And t hat wa s a bout  
our only e xperienc e wit h  Rus sia ns in our house.  
Other wise , most pe opl e lost
 their watches.  They 
were very hard pressed for watches.  It was 
a time when nobody in hi s 
right mind would wal k  
around i n Buda pest wit h  a watc h on his wrist .  Th
ey j ust , the y we re fas ci nate d.  The y  stop you and 
they took your wat ch.  That was t heir , t hei
r, their thing.  We ll,
 anyway, okay, ask. 
 

Q:  So the Russi ans  ha d moved i nto
 your  apart me nt  then . . .  
 

A:  Yeah,two. 

 

Q:  During t he Ger ma n  oc c upati on, t his  wa s be for e. . .  

 

A:  No, no, no.  Thi s wa s dur
ing the Russian occupation. 
 

Q:  Oh, a fter . [t a l kover ]  

 

A:  Oh  ye s.  I™ m 
talking about after, this
 all ha ppene d  a fter.  Oh no, t h
ere wer e no Russians during the 
Ger ma n  oc c upati on.  I wish t her e wer e.  No. 
 

Q: I wanted to go ba
ck just a little . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.  
 
Q:  –bit , I ha d, I ha d wa nt ed t o 
a sk you a bout whe n you were young
er as a chil d an
d you were  in  
school , wer e  your  frie nds
 most ly Je wi sh . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  Or  di d you s hare  . . . 

 

A:  Ye s.  Mo stly  Je wis h.  T h ere were  a few Gentil
e friends who never, ever  
me ntione d r eligion, ne ve r 
really ma de us feel inferi or, just 
a few.  And after t he war, I made 
it clear how much I appreciated it .  
So, I™ m gla d  that I coul d do that .  Now, I als o ha ve
 to say that not many of
 my cl assmat es sur vived 
because my Jewish cl assmat es were
 i n a labor bat t alion a nd t h ey we
re wor king out side Buda pest o n  
the day when the deportati
ons ca me to that village
.  And the gendarmerie ha
d an e mpty boxcart and  
they deci de d not t o let t he m go 
home but de port the m.  So very 
fe w Je wis h cla ss m ates o f  mine  
survived.  Gentiles, again, the 
war, the army eventually, ever
ybody who was fi
fteen, fo urteen, 
fi ft een, sixt e e n a t  t he end of t h
e war, the last few months, the 
Arr o w Cross  pe ople, the y force d  
childr en out  into the st re et wit h a gun.  So quit e a fe w of t he m di d not survive .  I real ly ha d ver y  

fe w contact with, with, with
 t he few t hat sur vived but
 there we ren™t too ma ny. 
 

Q:  And you ha d menti oned t hat your father™s 
e mpl oye r was  hel pi n g you a nd your mothe r out.

A: Yes. Yes.  Yes.  An
d my  father was very grat
eful  to him and worked for hi m again after the war. 
 

Q:  And so t he help that he gave you then during th
e ti me t hat your  fat her was a wa y was enough for you 
and your  mother t o– [tal kover ] 
 

A: Yes.  I also took a job.  
I was a messenger boy up
 until 19– until the yellow star came into  
existence– ™44 March.  I was a me
ssenger boy for architect ural fi r m
.  Be caus e  of t he  bicyc l e.  I  
coul d bicycl e around t hen, so I 
was delivering me ssages and things. 
 So, that suppl e me nted als o, my 
father™s salary which wasn™t a 
full salary, just
 part of it. 
 

Q:  And as t he war progres sed, was the  next si gni
fi cant e vent t hen, woul d have bee n t he Ger ma n  
occ upati on?  
 

A:  Ye s.  1944, March,
 i f  I r e me mbe r  it,  19
th
, i s when the Ger m
ans ha d s erious  doubt s a ppa rently, t hat  
Hungary i s not a tr ust ed ally a nym
or e, that Hungary pr obabl y  ente
rt ains t he idea of getting out of 
the war  because by th
at time I think Roma
ni a wa s ready t o ju mp a nd the  
situation in It al y was very 
sha ky s o the y deci de d to occ upy Hungary offici all y
 and put in a very righ
t-wing governme nt which 
was still a lot better than wh
at came in 1944, October.
  That will be the other 
stage.  But let™s take a  
look at what  happened when the 
Ger ma ns mar ched in, t he ye llow star
 ha d to be worn wit hin a fe w 
wee ks , or–  So, the  la bor batt a
lions were more intensified.  
Now e verybody who wa s ei ghte en ha d 
to go, t hat was now, t he y  lowere d 
the limit and the deport
ati ons  starte d.  So, unfortunate l y, t hat wa s 
the worst thing, the deportations.  
They started in the countryside, 
eventually coming to Budapest.  
The y were s uppos ed to c o me t o 
Buda pest , you know
, by the fa ll. 
 

Q:  You me nti oned t hat  your  fri e
nds were deporte d one  da y.   
 

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  How di d you manage  to a
voi d being deport ed your sel f?  
 

A:  That was just an, a coincidence,
 t hat my aunt, the  one 
who gained this specia
l status, said to me, 
ﬁPle ase , I jus t  have s o me very bad fe el ings , I do
n™t wa nt you to go today out
 and wor k.  Sta y home , 
stay with me.ﬂ  She took me to 
her apart ment and that was the day wh
en it happe ned.  
It  was just a, 
just a miraculous instin
ct that she had.  And 
that is wh at saved me . 
 

Q: Did life  take a turn after that
, a f ter the Ger ma n  occ upati on did 
you fe el , were  you able t o feed  
yoursel f a nd your mothe r ade quat ely?  
 

A:  We ll, what I  did was , I gather
e d,  I was al wa ys quite street s m
art and so I some
how found t hat t he  
best  way to do this  whol e 
thing is first to get some
 paper s t h at would quali fy us Šat  least to thos e 
who don™t know usŠas Chr i stia ns . 
 So I took my mother™s jewellrie
s , s o ld it, and bought pa per s.  
And t he papers were  bla nk a nd you 
had t o fill  it out .  And I did that
.  Al so, I got s o me papers a nd I  
fill it out with the same 
name fr om a cousin of mi ne wh o wa s 
adopte d but had birt h c er tifi cate an d 
everything else that pert
ained to the fact that he
 was a Gentile.  And his pa
rents gave me his papers 
too s o I had kind of this double i n
sur ance , moving around, in case I 
ne ede d it.  For a while, I di d not  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
15 
 
 
use these pa pers .  I wait ed unti l , you know, we go
t the point where it was necessary.  Also, there  
was a danger that until the Russian troops did no
t cross the Hungarian borde
r, it was a matter of a 
telephone call to find out if yo
u had false bi rth certi ficat es.  
All they had to do is call th e 
princi palit y, you know, a nd t hat , t hat  muni cipa
lit y a nd che ck, okay?  And so, act uall y, we  waite d 
until practically the first village fe
ll and, after that, it was much easi
er to fill it out, to a town or a 
village that had, that was alre
ady occupied unde
r occu– Soviet occupation 
because they couldn™t 
check anymore. 
 

Q: And after that point, 
did you us e t hos e papers?  
 

A:  The n, t hen, then we us ed the pape rs for awhile
, but it was a , it was ver y confusi ng peri od whe n we  
wer e  mo vin g a lot .  F i r s t, my wi fe,  my mot her 
and I moved to the, the 
apart ment of one of my 
fat her™ s frie nds.  They were Seve nth- Da y Adven
t i sts.  And t h ey offere d t heir pl ace but soon t hey 
learne d that Sevent h- Da y Adventi sts
 are just in the same
 da nger as Je ws s o aft er cons ultati on, we  
left.  T hen  we were,  we  we nt t o
 a , I  wa s al wa ys  on t he stree t , he
aring, fe eling, looking, what can  
happen? Th en I took my  mo ther to a Je wish  hi gh  
school  whic h was  designated as a cl ot hing s upply  
busi nes s for  the  Hunga r i an ar my a n d it  was  rea lly
 a refuge for, for Jews
.  T he y wer e  s e win g

Hungarian Jewi sh army of

, it was j ust c onst antl y you ha d 
to cha nge your 
pos ition a nd you 
had t o al wa ys look at what see ms  
safe at t he moment.  
And i t  is pos sible that
 something that was 
sa fe one wee k beca me unsa fe the next  wee k bec a
use some body recognize d one pers on i n that pl ace  

wh en he was walking down the street
, goi ng int o places, ﬁHer e is a 
Je w,  d oes n™t we ar
 a yellow star , 
what i s he doing? ﬂ And 
so, your life  depended
 on nuances, those days. 
 
Q:  So  you just took off the yellow star? 
 

A:  My a unt i s t he one who just ri
pped off t he yell ow star a nd sai d, 
ﬁ Y ou sta y  wit h me
,ﬂ a nd t hen my 
mother came there, too.  
An d thi s  is h ow we got t o
 this hous e i n Zic hy Jeno Street , One ,  in the Fi fth 
District of Budapest. 
 

Q: Now, I think before you even mo

en a lot of Allied bomb ings . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  Ha d there not? Of Budapest? 

 

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  So  whe r e we re y o
u during that time? 
 

A: We ll, we, whenever th
ere was a, up until we
 had to leave our own apar

there was a 
bombing we lived 
in the cellar, you know, so
me ti me s for hour s.  But us uall y, t he bombi ngs ca me at

I had to lay out all my st

could pick every one of my
 clothes and still do, to 
run down.  We  had second
s to run down in the bo

, ther e was no r eally

 of the bombers, many

t before that, there 
wa s not  that  much. 
 
Q:  So , when  wa s it 
that  you move d i n wi th your a unt?  
 

A: It was late fa ll, in 19
44, you know.  Late fal l t h
at – when we fel t  t hat t hat
 place  was  the be st plac e  
to be.  An d then it turned out to 
be a  very fort unat e  choice  be ca use 
in that house, th
er e was a famous 
Hungaria n psyc hiatris t .  Ps ychi atry 
was, in Hunga r y, at the ver y, ve ry earl y stage .  Thi s ma n be ca me  
very famous and since th
ere weren™t too many
, a great deal of his client
ele were fa mous politicians,  
actor s, actr e sses, wr iters.  So he was well- known a
ll over t he place and he had 
thi s idea that he is 
goi ng t o sa ve his fa mily and frien
ds  by number one , c onta cti ng a fasc
i st officer and I ™ve no i dea  
how he did it, who wants to save 
his skin and is willing 
to play this game of
 declaring the house a 
clinic  and, a nd do e veryt hing pos sibl e to sa ve 
t h e pe opl e i nsi de t he house  and t hen he  found thi s  
ma n and hi s  na me was Jerec z ian 
Ar a Ge org e .  An d thi s  is in 
reverse order because Hungarian 
names are i n  reverse order.
  The last name 
is  wh at we  co nsi d er firs t 
s o i n  Engli sh you woul d sa y 
George Ara Jereczian.  The, I reme
mber hi m, a ve ry handsome  ma n, 
a very, kind of a man of stature  
and a fa scist uni for m, hand gre nades hangi ng fr om hi
s belt .  I mean, he was i nti midating to anyone .  
To, wit h us , he was ve ry kind.  
The, I suppos e, looki ng back t hat
 we about three hundr ed doctor s  
and families in that ap
artment house jammed, ab
solutely jammed.  While
 we could still live 
upst airs , pr obabl y there wer e at lea st  fi ve to t en 
peopl e to a r oom.  When we li ve d in t he ba se me nt, 
no one is to tell, we were just si
de by s i de on mattr esse s beca us e wh
en the si ege of 
Budapest started, 
you couldn™t  live upstair s  anymore.
  So t his ma n move d in wi th 
a fe w of his me n 
who appare ntly 
wer e  loyal  t o hi m a nd his girl fr
i end a nd the y set up t heir  hea d
quart er s there 
and they were 
practi cally li ke a, a, a support group.  The cli n
ic had it s offi cial embl em t here and the whole 
oper ation looke d like it wa s a lega l operati on t o s ave 
anybody wh o is injured.  
‚ Ka y?  No w, we™re at  
the end? 
 

Q:  Why don™t  we  pa us e her e?  I™d li
ke  to as k you s o me mor e . . . 
 

A:  Ok ay .

that you stopped  
goi ng to school at a c ert ain point a n d I wa nte d t o 
hear about  what you di d wi
t h your days at that  
ti me .  When was t hat exactly?

A:  It wa s, i t  wa s in 19 44
, [c oughs ] excus e me.  Afte
r I fi nis he d what would be
 eighth grade  here , it wa s  
the fourt h grade of mi ddle s chool a nd I was s u ppo
sed to then go to what
 they call gymnasium, 
whi ch is  hi gh s chool  in Eur ope.   I  c oul d not  ge
t  into a high s chool and 
s o  it wa s not a  long peri od 
but bet we en 1944, I  ha ve to figure
 t his out .  Le t ™ s se e, 1925, 40, 
ri ght .  So the r e wa s a year , ™ 43 

beca use I was, I le ft the school , ™43 s o I had one 
year whe n a ctuall y I didn™t do much except odd 
jobs .  My fa ther was a w ay, s o, a s I me ntione d befo
re I delivered, worked for an architect ural fir m 
and deli vere d bl uepr ints , whate ver I can fi nd but I 
coul d not get into hi gh school .  The  higher four  
grades of hi gh s chool , the gymnasi u
m.   A nd so my  mot h er
 suggested that we hire a tutor so by th e 
ti me I woul d be availa ble  for hi gh s chool , I woul dn
™t miss mu ch.  And thi s 
is why I had a pr ivat e 
tutor.  I was studying especially
 Latin because everybod
y suggested that t h at woul d pr obabl y cre ate  
a problem when all of a sudden 
I, wa r woul d be overŠwe we re 
always optimistsŠand I could go 
to, ins t ea d of the fir st for m to the sec ond for m an
d Lati n woul d create the biggest pr oble m.  So for  
Lati n and Algebr a, I had a tut or, some body in, 
i n my mo ther ™s d i s t an
t fa mi ly, who li ved i n  
Budapest.  And this 
is how the year went
 by.  There was rea
lly not much else, 
a little work and a 
little study. 
 

Q:  At t hat  ti me ,  was,  were  you  
and your mot her aware of the so-
calle d Final  Soluti on and what was  
happe ning t o  Je ws  el se where i n Eur ope?  
 

A:  Ye s.  My  mo ther  s o meho w, we
ll, first of all the BBC, of cour
se, unfortunately told us what 
happened to the Jews who were 
taken away to concentration camp
s and death camps but  by the t hat  
ti me it wa s well known i n Hungar y t oo, what t he de
portati ons, how the de port
ati ons end up.  So my 
mother was extremely upset , for u
ndersta nda ble r easons a nd I  really had t o kind of ke ep he r spir it  

up and, constantly re minding her that ther
e are certain things
 we can™t change 
and she still has to  
live for her own little immedi
ate fa mily.   But yes, we were very
 much aware, very
 much aware. 
And even though it was very
, very difficult to get 
BBC and up until 1944, Marc
h, or April when the 
radios had to be tu
rned in, we could s
till get BBC.  And I learned fr om
 my father, I 
was six years 
old whe n I  l earne d from my 
fat her  that there i s more
 to news than just the 
Hungaria n papers  a nd the  
Hungaria n r adio.  He woul d cl ose  t he s hut ters  a t  
certain times, he always
 changed t he ti mes, of 
cour se, he woul d loc k t he  doors a nd he woul d list e
n to BBC.  At a ver y ear
ly age and woul d tell me  
that t his i s t he tr uth.  Event uall y, it  became 
ver y da ngerous  bec aus e the  Ge r mans woul d have  a 
devi ce that was on top of a car, si milar pr obably to 
what ra dar  is t oda y, tha t
 woul d circl e and tr y t o  
fi nd people  who listened to for ei gn br oadcas ts
.  And it  was puni s habl e also by going to 
concentr ation camp. 
 

Q:  And yet , des pite your a w arene
ss of what was happeni ng elsewhere 
i n Eur ope , you a n
d your mother  
re mained, or  at l east  your  mot her
 remained optimistic en
ough to fi
nd you a 
tutor  and to . . .  
 

A:  Ye s.  Ye s.  [talko ver ]  Well, I 
think this is in the Jewish nature, 
if you c ons ider the fac t  that pe opl e  
in boxcars going to Auschwit
z were still running schools, right?  It™s
 just that, this pa
rt of the, of the 
opti mi s m and the fact t h at you have to learn, lear n 
and le arn.  That was with us .  That  kind of a  
fe eling ne ver  le ft us  a nd we  ne ver  rea lly gave up. 
 

Q:  Wa s your tut or J e wis h?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

A:  Ye s, yes , ye s.  S he wa s.   And  
she wa s just a dist a nt c
ous in o f my , my  mo t her a nd  s he,  I eve nt ually  
met  her when I  was in Isr ael, ag
ain. She emigr a
ted to Israel. 
 
Q:  And, we re, well le t™s jus t  go fort h 
to the, oka y, le t ™ s go bac k to your , y
our  home wit h 
your a unt t hat 
you had moved int o several mont hs  aft er t he  Ger ma n
 occ upat ion and you had 
be gun to de scribe t o  
me this hous e, and the man who 
had bee n a me mber of Arrow Cr
os s who had e stabli she d it as a  
clinic.  And as, as it wa
s established as a clinic
, did t he sa me pe opl e wh
o had be en living in it 
be for e, di d s o me of t he m  move out  or  ha
ve  to lea v e or  just mor e people ca me?  
 

A:  No, those who were i n
 the hous e, they were all o we d to sta y, whi ch is obvious, I me a n, a nybody  
who would have bee n tosse
d out would have ha d to go t o the ghett
o.  And it was, to most people, it  
was clear t h at event uall y the ghett o  is going t o
 be a nnihila t ed.  Ther e wa s no othe r way, si nce 
Budapest was surrounded 
by then by the Soviet for
ces, what else ca
n you do with 
it? They built a  
huge woode n wall  around t he  ghett o
 and, according to the rumors, 
they would just
 detonate the 
whole thi ng or burn it down or, but
 they would not let the Jews su
rvive if the si
ege had last ed 
anot her wee k or so.  The  lu
cky thing is that they just ran out of 
ti me .  I, of cour se I was  never i n the  
ghetto, but no, those who were in 
the house, they could 
stay, and a lot of other fa milies mo ved in,  
practi cally al l of the m connected
 to fa mous  Hung
a rian doctor s. 
 

Q:  Be fore  the  hous e wa s e st ablis hed a s a  clini c . . . 

 

A:  It was  a Je wi sh ho use .  

 

Q:  It was a Jewi sh house . . . 

 

A:  Ye s.   It  was  a Je wi sh  h ou s e.   It
 had, it wa s a desi
gnated Jewi sh house. 
 

Q:  And who wa s livin
g i n your a unt ™s apa rt me nt  with you?  
 

A: We ll, about at least ten other 
me mber s of our fa mily.  Some ot her 
aunts a n d brot her s of my fathe r, 
my mot her , of cours e , a nd I .  
I sa y, and it was a , about one and 
a half room apartment and ther e 
wer e ple nty of pe ople i n  it.  But t hat  was t he, 
t h e least of our proble ms
, really, you know.  We  
coul d, we c oul d slee p very well.  There were a lot 
worse ar rangements i n B
uda pe st at that ti me . 
The r e wer e, there  were  pe ople  in Swedi sh- pr ot
ected houses in, near  
the Danube, wh ere, I 

underst and, people c oul dn™t even sl
ee p.  The y jus t  wer e, you know, 
pr acti cally bac k t o bac k in a 
room, t her e wer e so ma ny pe ople ja mme d in.  Thi s
 is the one t hat Wall en
– what was  his na me , th e  
Swedish diplomat, Wallenbe
rg, the one, that was hi
s little area, Raoul Wa llenb
erg.  But I never, I 
we nt a couple of time s by, but I never we nt up but 
I noti ced t hat there j ust, ther e were just l ots of  
lots of pe opl e. 
 

Q:  And then this house, before 
it was established as a 
clinic , we re t here  non-
Jews living as well?  
 

A:  Ye s.  Yes .  An d i ntere st ingl y, 
I can remember 
that a couple of non-Jewish
 fa milies stayed there. 
The y just sta yed t here .  By t hat ti me , per ha ps 
what we nt t hrough their mi
nd is , that, si nce t he war  
inevitably is coming to an end, it™
s not a bad idea  to be here when 
the Soviet troops c o me.  So tha t  
must have been t heir r ea soni ng.  
And it was not , not i
mpr actic a l , act uall y.  At t he s a me ti me , e ve n in

the la st wee k , we were in danger of be ing ta ke n 
to the Danube, that was th

of getti ng ri d of Je ws who were di s covered outs i
de the ghett o, marc he d down a nd s hot int o the  
river .  It wa s a col d, bit t er, s nowy winter and t he Danube wa s red a nd ful l  of cor pses .  But I  
remember t hat even t he last 
wee k, some body fr om the nei g hborh
ood re porte d us to the fas cist  
authorities and t hey ca me and tri ed 
t o di sar m Jer eczian Ara George™s

bodyguar ds .  And he  se e me d, he  al most see me d he
lpl ess .  We were  alre a dy l i ne d up and the n he  
agai n arri ve d there, a ma zingl y, he  di d thi s mor e
 than once, wit h some 
paper from a very special  
higher aut hority t hat sai d , ﬁClear 
out  of here .  Thi s is  a prot ect ed 
territory and we do
 our job for t he 
government and l eave us alone.ﬂ  
We confronted the man aft er the 
war.  I know t hat .  He was 
caught , the one who re ported us bec ause he was  
stupi d e nough to show up the last wee k be for e  
Buda pest wa s, Pest wa s occ upie
d, and poi nte d fi nger s.  I al s o 
re me mber  anot her ma n who wa s a  
fascist  officer that  lived a couple 
of hous es across  from us  who was  
also quite antagonistic toward 
us and we were worrie d about hi m. 
 And also the last week, t hey brou
ght him in with 
a head injury. 
He was s hot in the hea d i n the street fighti ng.  
The r e was tre me ndous str e et fi ghti ng a nd he wa s just  
left there to die.  And I don™t know, I was jus t  fa
scinated by, by this man 
t hat, that eve r ybody wa s  
always a frai d of a nd her e he wa s, ba sicall y a not h

d in spite of my goo d  
judge me nt, I  wat ched hi m, kept goi ng ba ck to hi m,
 as  a young ma n all nigh
t, wa tch hi m how he was  
dying.  And I can™t, I st
ill cannot explain this fa sc
ination, because ever sinc
e I couldn™t look at 
anot her human bei ng, even an ani mal  that is dyi ng
.  But s o mehow, ther e wa s a mi xed fe eling i n me  

of reve nge and sati s facti on tha t  this s cum is, is not going to be  here any longer a nd I wante d to se e  

how he was goi ng.  An
d my mo th er, I re me mb er sc
ol ded me for this and c onst antl y wa s taking me 
bac k to our place , wher e  we, our sle eping arra nge m
ent was.  But , there, t here were i n cide nts like 
this and it was a ver y, ve ry stra nge pe riod for a fi
fteen- year- ol d boy.  My j ob was basic ally to ta ke  
legs and ar ms up t hat wer e cut  o
ff, operated on i n the 
so-called operati ng room
 whi ch  was a , a  da rk  
part of the  base me nt a nd ki nd of arr ange t he m on

 And whe n i n, whe n i n  
January 18
th
, we we nt up, upstair s, e v erybody was  horri fi

pil es of li mbs j ust  
piled up on t he c ourt yar d.  And 
most of it, I ha d t o pile  up be
cause I was the on

sent up wit h  these .  The doct ors oper ated wit hout  
any anesthesis [sic], anyt

that, whenever I look 
int o  that house, t hat al ways comes t o 
my  mi nd, how these h

die but  they keep t heir  secrets. 
 

Q:  Ha d any of t he ot her people who 
wer e living in your a unt™ s a part m

A: I have a fe eling th

I thought that this was my last 
mo me nt on ear th.  I wa s s e nt ou
t to get something, I think, if I 
remember correctl y, I was sent ou

 fr om shrapnels 
and we needed 
some me at .  And t he onl y kind of 
mea t , whe ne ver we ha d me at , the on

hors e meat .  And of fall e n hor ses , hor ses tha t  we re

I also crawled out to get water.  There were cer

 was still intact and you  
coul d get some water .  And a patr
ol  ca me  a nd c a ught me  a n d t hey
 said, ﬁOkay, here, come , come  
into the doorway of this
 hous e,ﬂ  and t h ey wer e s houting, yelli

ﬁLook, I s ee  four , five J ews on th

and he said, ﬁList en,ﬂ he said, ﬁar

yes.  He said, he sai d, 
ﬁGo back and I don™t ever

And I told my mother

you know, s endi ng a c ontinge nt of 
people to, to get it and then we 
brought it back and then we, we 
divided it.  He had 
his little place there and he

disci plined peopl e.  He di d not have to go down pe

 least, if nothing else 
on pa per .  M y mother  wa s a  nurse , for  exa mple .  
 
Q:  And your  only j ob was  
to take these limbs? 
 
A:  We ll, I wa s, wh at th ey
 c a lled, I was a me sse nger, 
you know, I wa s an errand
 boy.  I was  fi ft een, a nd 
so, that was, I had 
a little uniform and 
a gray overall with a,
 kind of a military 
cap.  But I was in  
charge of taking the, 
the severed things up. 
 

Q:  Did you have any fr
ie nds  in the  buil di ng?  
 

A:  I, di d I  ha ve , yes, I had a frie nd
.  And it  was  the first  
time in my life that 
I really fe lt a sexual 
attraction toward a woman.  
And I was kind of a cute
 little kid and she was a lot older than I.  And I  
think under di fferent circumstance
s, probabl y, we woul d have be en
 much cozier but  it was, ther e 
wer e too ma ny people ar ound.  I li ke d her .  She wa
s a, belie ve it or not , th
ere wa s a, a mong ot her  
things, there was a famous
 Hungaria n Je wi sh c o me dia n who also
 ended up i n our, i n our pl ace . 
Alphons o.  And thi s wa s the ot he

me good frie nds  
and I ha d all kinds of fant asies a bout her and ma ybeshe, t oo, about me.  Bu
t my mo th er wa s arou nd  
and too many people a nd so our attr a ction never rea
lly ca me t o anyt hi ng e l se, but just t hat.  But we  
spent a lot of time to
gether and, and, and it was 
just a nice puppy love, I th
i nk, that I™ ve had for  the  
first time in my life
 with an olde r, some body wa
s  at t hat ti me  older , not  to

a lot of friends in the 
Italian school in Budapest, 
the Italian embassy ma

And I fell in love 
with this girl.  
And the stupid thing, the reason th
is ties in with this

 I pronounci ng your  name  
correctly?   
 

A:  Hol czer . 

 

Q:  Hol czer .  Holczer.  I™ m i nterested

ng what  you did for entert ainme n t, 
how you, i f you ma
na ged to fi nd 
any ga mes  t o play or  wa ys t o ha ve fun?  
 

A:  We ll, i f I reme mber c orr ectly, we di d not play 
a n y ga mes bec ause the day went by wit h constantly  
watching out to survive.  We watc
he d the st reets ,  we list ene d to the ra di o.  I re me mber  that I was  
terribl y concerne d with the expres s i on of a dult s
 around me, I wa tche d their fa ce s.  I always  
suspect ed t h at they know more th
an what t hey woul d tell  me and 
somehow, in the la
st  fe w wee ks , I 
just bec a me obs ess ed wit h, wit h t his  busi nes s of s urv
ival.  I couldn™t think of
 a nyt hing else and my  
uncle, who is, the one who is still
 alive, reminded me that my 
constant question to him was, 
practi cally hourl y, ﬁ How long will this last?  How 
long will  this last? ﬂ Thi s was my constan t  
question.  I was just counting the 
hours.  We knew that the, that
 the streetfighting between the 
Ger ma ns and the Russia ns ca nnot be
 mor e than a couple
 of city bl oc ks awa y.  We s a w Ger ma n  
soldi ers , inj u red, moving down the st
r eet and we heard, pr actically, th
e gunfir e as i f it were next t o 

us.  Some peopl e ca me in injur ed who re porte d that
 jus t  a couple of bl ocks fro m us  there were  
already Russian soldiers so it was 
that, that, that tension that kept
 me  fr om doing a nyt hing el se 
except just waiti ng for t hat
 final onslaught when I can
 see that our area is liberat ed.  There was j ust 
no mood for pla ying.  We  were  no
t children.  None of us were
 chil dren.  We wer e, all our 
conversations, I remember, with the,
 wit h the kids  of my a ge down 
there, al l, everyt hing was al ways 
revol ving ar ound sur viva l .  
 

Q:  So even before 
the, the a c tual sie ge you didn™t have ? 
 

A: No, before the ac
tual siege, yes, I, i s
till contacted sometime
s my old Boy Scout comrades, they 
wer e the one s that I ke pt up wit
h.  But  onc e of c our se, t he si ege st

to go out a nd do a nyt hing like t hat .

Q:  So s o me of your , your Boy Scout  
comrades had escaped t he deportat ion? 
 

A:  Oh  y e s,  well , re me mber  t hese  were  n ot sc ho ol , th
ese wer e not  school  people,
 I told you that.  No, 
these ar e all fr om vari ous , the Boy Sc out gr oup, th
e me mbershi p consiste d of
 people from anywhere  
in Buda pe st  and for var i ous a r eas a nd quite a few 
of t he m survi ve d.  So, e ven a ft er  the war, of  

cour se, we met  for a whi le and then
 we deci de d t here i s nothi ng i n 
it for us anymore 
a nd t hat™s  whe n  
I joi ned t he Zionist  M ove ment .  That  gave me  
a lot more important goal
s  than t he  Boy Scout s. 
 

Q:  The, the Boy Sc outs, your 
frie nds  fr om the  Boy Sc outs we
ren™t in the ghetto then.   
 

A:  No .  Some of them did go in, 
you know, some of them 
did go in.  But others were n™t .  And so we 
communicated and visited with 
a  c ouple of, who wer e outs i de . 
 

Q:  You woul d go t o 
e ach ot her™s home?  
 

A:  Ye s. Ye s. St rictly, you know, 
stri ctly so.  We  di dn™t wa nt a n
y conver sati o n, any, any public plac e  
that can be overheard.  Because our  mai n concer
n was t he ki nd of topic t h
at others shoul dn™t  hear. 
 

Q:  Suc h as  wha t ? 

 

A:  Well, where are the Russian forc
es? What did you hear? 
All this.  Wh at did 
the radi o say?   We 
didn™t ha ve any ra di os, the Je ws, ri ght?  But th
ose who we re hidi ng, a
nd were per haps wi th a  
Christian fa mily, they coul
d still listen to BBC so 
that was the, the entire 
existence was 
the war and 
the t opi cs  we re just t hat . 
 
Q:  No w t he, th e  clinic, wh at,  wh o wer e  the pe ople t h
at the clinic would treat? Was it just anyone who  
would happe n t o be i njur ed?  
 
A: We ll,theoretically,we 
wer e supposed to tr eat fa
scist offici a l s acc ordi ng to
 all the papers and the, 
the per mit  t hat our  lea d er, you k
now, had.  But there wa
s such chaos in the 
last fe w weeks, you 
know, when the siege of B
udapest st arted, that we treated ever
ybody who ca me i n 
fro m t he st ree t  
wh o wa s i nj ured .  And  it  wa s path
etic , s o meti me s, that pe opl e would 
c o me in with  s o me  ver y mi nor  
problems and leave the clinic, a
nd wit hin mi nutes they we r e brou
ght back with, with practically  
their guts out.  In other words, in order to reach 
us, t hey we nt through s u ch da nge r that they lost 
their lives, eventually.  We  had,
 we had no medici ne l e ft, we 
had pra cticall y not hing.  So we  
coul dn™t do muc h.  Anybo
dy, anybody wa s tre ated.
  And doct ors are doct ors .  I wa s always  
interested in, especiall y when ther
e was a fasci st official, what  did 
t he y do t o hi m?  Would they take  
advantage of the fact that  here we are, you know, 
lost all fa mily me mbers a
nd all this, but I talked 
to, this interested me and I talk
ed to some of the doctors and th
ey sai d there™ s no such t hing, a 
doct or cannot do t hat.   
 

Q:  Did  t he clini c  wor k wit h
 any of the ot her r esc ue  or gani zations  i n a ny way?  

 

A:  No , we did n ™ t.  B y t hat ti me , 
there wa s no contact , not hi
ng.  Everybody™ s out fo

wa s, there was just , eve r ythi ng c olla pse d.  The st r

this was their way to get their reveng

was, it was the, a to
tal  rei gn of terr or. 
 
Q:  What  about  befor e t he si ege, si ege?  

 

A:  Before t he siege, it was alrea
dy l ea ding up t o t his beca us e th
ey, as soon as 
the  Ar ro w Cro ss 
move me nt t ook over on
 Oct ober 15, the , the y s t arted.  It 
was just a s ba d.  And the  mi nute t h e  
admiral who was the head of Hung

spee ch in whi ch he announce d 
that as far as he was concerned 
 th e war wa s lo st , at 
that mome nt, you know, 
hell br oke l oose.  He  
wa s arrested, his bodygu
ards were arrested. 
 

Q:  And you, a s soon as t hat , that date , Oc
tober  15, you j ust di dn™t  go outside a nymore?  
 

A:  No, well , we , that was the date 
whe n the house, t h e stor y I tol d  you be ga n t o get , ta ke s hape, oka y?  
Thi s was when we kind of put our 
hea ds toget her a nd we l earne d that this ps ychi atrist i s t aking st eps  
to bring t his man i n 
and all this.  We had to ac
t  very quickly because event s
 were really
 comi ng to  
an end.  The Russians were appro
aching Buda pes t  rapidl y and we kne w that agai n, t hat  gives t he ,  
these guys very little time
 to kill all of us.  A
nd they were getting mo
re and more vicious, 
a mazingly.  I nstea d of sa ving thei r s k
in, t hey became ev
en mor e viole nt. 
 

Q:  Okay, so, be fore the  sie g e, and 
you were s o meti mes goi ng out . . . 

 

A:  Ye s, ye s.  

 

Q:  You woul d deliver  mes sa ges?  
 
A:  Right, right.  I had, you know, 
the uni form and the ID a
nd all this.  I was sent 
t o get our  
rations, you 
know, I wa s sent  to pi ck up so
me  papers or pick up me dici
ne.  Yeah, I wa
s  j ust a . . . 
 

Q:  But you had no contact w
ith t he Red Cross  or  wit h t he di ffer e nt le gati ons. 
 

A: We ll, the, the Red, if
 I r e me mbe r  co rrectly , we h a d so me , s o
me very vague contact with the Red 
Cross , I probabl y pic ke d  up medi cine fr om the m  
or somet hing for the, fo
r the or gani z ation.  But  
pers ona lly, I had no as a ,  as an indi vi dual , I had no 
contact other than with th
e, just with the Swiss 
Emba ss y.  I told you I ha d a Switz, Swis s 
schutzpass
, that by the time th
e Arr o w Cr oss  mo ve me nt  
started, meant very little. 
 

Q:  How di d you, how
 did you get that 
sc hutzpässe
? 
 

A:  We ll, you c o uld go to the  Swedi sh Embass y or 
t h e Swiss Embass y and they
 would, put you on the 
list and eventually would give it to
 you.  And it was really
 just a, kind of a,
 a smokescr een.  Ther e 
wa s not muc h, i f you wer e
 lucky, t hey respec ted it and t hey le
t you go.  If you we
re unl ucky, t hey  
just tor e it a part a nd sai d , ﬁSt ep i nto t he wagon,
ﬂ you know, a nd you wer e  gon

never know. It, those embassi
es issued this in good faith but th
e pe opl e who looked 
at it, you were  
at the mercy of t hose.   And I ju
st happened to go to the Swiss on

probabl y you he ard the  s t ory, the Ja
panes e, it  was  a Ja panese  i n, i n, 
not  in Hungary, I t hink it wa s i n  
Lithua nia or some where , did the  sa me  thi ng. 
 
Q:  Ye s.  

 

A:  So, in Hungary, it wa s 
mai nly t he Swedi sh and the, and the 
Swiss and I think the Vatican too.  
There was some, even t hou
gh that t he Pri mat e of Hungar y was 
al most l i ke a c olla bor a t or.  He did  
not  reall y act  ver y courageous
ly unde r  the  Nazi  era .   
 

Q:  Do  you reme mb er wh
en t he siege began? 
 

A:  Ye s.  It was in Dece mb er , i f I kn o w, Dec e mb e r 2 0
th
 or some t hing, very cl ose t o Christ ma s.  That™ s  
when it– really, it just, all of 
a  sudde n we we re shot at fr om 
every di rection.  We  kne w t hat  
Buda pest wa s totall y surr ounde d.  Th
e airpla nes wer e just c o mi ng day a n d night.  The y we re call e d  
ratas, R, A, T, A, these small  
Sovi et airplanes machin
e-gunni ng a nyt hi ng on t he st reet  that move d. 
It wa s very dangerous to get out on the street.  An
d of c our se, then, whe n it
 came to ni
ght, anybody 
wa s movi ng coul d have been als o s
hot  by the fa sci sts, by t he Arrow 
Cr oss  peopl e, ‚ca use  the y wer e  
also moving.  And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of 
injuries, a smell of, of th
e stenc h of, of gunpowder  
and, and cor pses came cl oser , you kno
w?  War has a certai n smell , a ve
ry very unplea s ant s mell t ha t  
you c an reall y honestl y fe el.  And 
as a child, I  learned t hat .  That ™s, 
t hat™ s all I  can te
ll  you, but . . . 
 

Q: Now, so the entire 
buildi ng the n moved down
 into the basement?  
 

A:  Ye s, the enti re Buda pest lived i n ba s e ments . 
 Some of the newe r houses
™ base me nts wer e clea n, 
perhaps dry, you know.  And you c
oul d make i t  with a littl e effort to become temp orary li ving 
quarters.  But those built in the 19
th
 cent ury, the y were da mp, dark, th
ey were j ust awful.  Col d.  
And luckily, that this house, this 
Zic h y Jeno Stre et  was a fairl y, fairl y ne w hous e.  And t he bas e me nt  
was livable.  Now where I lived, wher
e I lived before, in mo
st  of my li fe , bac k, t hat ba se ment  was  
suc h that I , oh, I woul dn™t have
 wa nted to spe n d a ny ti me  r i ght
 t her e because it 
wa s  a da mp, ol d 
typic al, wha t  you see al most in 
Di ckensian, you know, movies or 
r ead a bout Dickensian novels . 
Als o, there wer e rats, loved thi s kind of a mois
t dark envir onme nt.  But here , I reme mber our  
basement as quite
 civilized in, in this house.
  So it was, the ha
rdship was not really
 bad and 
so many  
people , t he heat, I t hink, of the  bodi
es  ma de  up for the col d out s i de.   
 

Q:  How ma ny peopl e wer e t here?  

 

A:  Oh , I wo ul d say  we we re a fe w h un d
re d people  in t hat bas e me nt , yea h?  
 

Q:  How bi g wa s the bas e me nt?  

 

A:  Oh, it , it would be li ke a fl oor
, an entire floor of th
e house, because it was,
 usually the basements 
wer e what you can co
nsi der a  low fl oor .  So, it
™s , I cannot  re ally des cribe  it in, i n s quare foota ge  
beca use  at t h at ti me I  di dn™t e ven, I di dn™t eve n 
know about  tha t , but it , it 
was a good size apart ment  
house fl oor, oka y, 
just pictur e it .  And t h
ere  wer e mattr e sses down, and everybody brought t he 
matt resses down, and there were 
pe ople ver y cl osel y situate d and, 
was in a way, it wa s kind of a 
war m pl ace.

Q:  Were t her e separat e r ooms? 

 

A:  There were a fe w, but mainly the separate ro
oms were, were given to 
the doctors for operation, 
oper ating rooms and, a n d suppl y rooms a nd t hings like 
t hat .  Most of t he  people live d in, i n thes e  
big open areas. 
 

Q:  So the treatments continued, then? 

 

A:  Ye s, yes , y e s .  Up unt il th e, p r
actically the last minute
.  And then the liberati
on, Ja nuary 18, is when  
we he ard t h e e mer ge ncy wa ll of our  bas e ment.  We
 heard a knock and by 
law, there was a, an 
e merge nc y e ntrance t o e v ery one  of
 t h ese basements bet w een t wo hous
es that consisted only of one 
layer of bric ks.  So, a nd there ha d to be a pick ne
xt to it.  So we heard 
that a pick was worki ng ,  
brea king thr ough.  And t hen
, must ha ve be en a bout four o™cl ock, fi ve o™ cl ock i n the morni ng a nd a ll 
of a sudde n the furre d hat hal f of a young Russi an 
soldier, Soviet soldier,
 came through first and  
then the whole body.  An d 
this was first time, I th
i nk, that he got a  hug 
from pe opl e be caus e, and he 
coul dn™t understa nd why, he was abs o lutely be wil d ered
 beca us e , of c our se , t he Soviet s ol diers we re 
not welco med with great enthusia
s m anywhere  si nce most  Hungari
ans were hoping for a German 
victor y and  we , we  were  ju
st  huggi ng and kiss ing hi m. 
 

Q:  Be fore we go for war d, you, so the tr eat ment s 
continued but so, s o me body wa s act ual l y was going 
out  onto the  streets  duri ng t hat t i me a nd . . . 
 

A:  We we re, yeah, bringing in pe
opl e fr om just t h e vicinit y, okay, ver y cl ose vi cinit y.  And peopl e  
would c o me  in on their own too, you 
know, wit h a, wi th a s hrapnel or s o methi ng i n their leg or a  
small injury. 
 

Q:  And was some body go
ing out  to get  food?  
 

A:  We ll, we ha d be ans.  We, we , 
I r e member t hat we practicall y ha
d bea ns ever y day.  Bea ns , beans  
and bea ns.  As l ong as you have 
bea ns, you can r eally s urvi ve .  An
d water ,  yeah, water wa s drippi ng  
but sti ll, we  coul d ge t a t  enough wa ter to, for 
dr inki ng.  Nobody 
took a  showe r , t ha t ™s for s ure . 
The r e wa s n o wa y.  
 

Q:  Was t her e a place to cook
 in the, in the basement? 
 

A: Yep.  People had these little, you know, stoves.  A lot of
 people had little stoves and they shared 
those, whole fa milies.  There was,
 amazingly, it was a 
very peaceful environm
ent because we all, 
we  only had one important thing 
in our mi nd, to get ou
t of there, alive. 
 An d people shared. 
 

Q:  So everybodyma naged 
to get along [talkover]?  
 

A:  Ye s, nobody, there wa
s no suc h t hi n g as  lea vi
ng some body st arving or 
l ea ving s o me body wit hout  
fuel, or, I remember that everyb
ody was doing their be

there are small little

no bi g probl e ms.   
 
Q:  How ma ny doctor s w

A:  It™s hard for me t o l ook back 
but I would s ay we  had at l east t h irty
 doct ors t here, at

with me in the base me nt in this
 house .  I– s o
mebody s e nt me , I 
think, a ne wspa per articl e or whil e in visiti ng in Bu
dape st I sa w it, he ga ve 
an interview about it. 
Because it  was t he fi ftiet h  an
niversar y of t he l i ber at i on of Budapest t his  ye ar.   
 

Q: Wa s Jereczian still in, s
till with you at that point, 
at the point of the siege? 
 

A:  Jerec z ian?  

 

Q:  Yea h .  

 

A:  Oh he st aye d, he sta ye d all the ti me , he sta ye d, he
 neve r le ft the plac e.  Yea h.  So, no, he wa s the r e  
all the ti me.  And i f he had to lea ve for some re as
on, he made sure that he l eft e nough peopl e there  

to, to pr otect  us . 
 

Q:  So he  had made  just  a  c o mple
te break from th
e Ar ro w Cr oss?  
 

A:  Ye s, appare ntly, appare nt ly a nd 
wh y he even joined them and wh at 
wa s his  job there , I don™t know . 
I don™t know.   Since I le ft in 1948, you know, a
nd I think that proba bly it 
t o ok a fe w yea r s to write  
about t hese t hings and cl ear up this
 t hing and I was not t here i n these,
 from ™ 48 to ™ 50.  And a ft er I  
ca me bac k, you j ust didn™t wa nt t o, t hos e wer e t h
e wor st year s of Stali nis
m and you didn™t  want  t o  
get invol ve d with a nythi ng beca use you didn™t know 
wha t  he wa s doing at that ti me  and s o, no 
que stions as ked was t he best polic y.  But , later on in
 the sixti e s and se ve nti es, I hea r d that he was a  
concert i mpr essari o and t hat he took certain shows 
back t o Budapest .  And I  even sa w hi s na me a nd 
I am, I really regret that I didn™t go to see hi m.  
I s hould ha ve l ooked for hi m so mehow and tal ked t o 
him.  So I feel so strongly about 
this whole thing that if I knew today that he is still alive, living, I 

would pr oba bly go to Vi
enna.  That™ s wher e he l ived and, an
d, and j ust t hank hi
m a g ain.   But  I  
know that he recei ved a great deal
 of recogniti on fr om people.  Bu
t I know, I don™
t know exactl y  
what, i f he™s  alive toda y. 
 He was , I would say, a bout ten, at l
east te n, fi ft e en ye ars older tha n I, s o  
it™s hard to s ay. 
 

Q: We ll, let™s go back to the, to
 the liberation.  So there™s a Russi
an soldier who br oke thr ough a nd yo u

A:  What di d I do a fter t hat?   Well , 
I di d what pr oba bl y is a nat ural  thi
ng t o do.  I went wit h the Rus sia n 
soldi ers and whenever t h ey br oke i nt o a stor e and th
ey broke i nto ever y store that stil l had anything, 
I went with them.  And af
ter they were through and took what 
they want ed t o t ake , I  took what  I  
wa nte d to take.  In ot her words , I did what we c all ed 
zabralny
 whi c h mea n s to con f
iscate things.  I 
wa s full of hate, I was fu
ll of fr ustrat i on a nd I thought thi s, t hi s
 was t he wa y to get eve n, probably. 
And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supp
ly of all these stolen 
goods that I got fr o m 
shops t hat were just the r e , most  pe opl e woul dn™t da
re to go i n wit h the Rus sians , but I put ba ck my  
yellow star a nd I we nt wi th the m 
and unle ss I bumped i nto some Ukrai nians, who were famous ant i-
Se mite s a nd beat the  hel l  out of yo
u, t he, the  ot her s, t he y, t he y we
r e welc omi ng you.  The y said go 
ahead.  Also, we had a, a little Je
wish domestic from Ro
mania with us, who jo
ined us and helped 
my , my  mo t her a nd sh e also spe nt 
t h e last fe w mont hs wit h us int his , in t his base me nt.  And s he 
was from Romani a and wi
t h the Russians we had Roma nia n 
troops comi ng i n.  And s he wa s a  
bea uti ful young girl, ni neteen, and th
e Roma nia n officer s wer e just, just
 a bsol utel y cra zy about her. 
So she t ook me by t he ha nd a nd she s a id, ﬁCome wit h
 me.ﬂ  And s he we nt wi
th these Romanians to 
all the jewelry st ores and sh e amasse d a fortun e with
in da ys  i n je we
lry.  And then 
said goodbye to 
us and disa ppeare d.  We  never fo
und out wha t  happe ned to her. 
 She had a fi ancee in Romania ,  
wh ether she found him or not, we
 susp ected she eventu
ally ended up in Is
rael  like most young 
people of that time.  But I went
 wi th her a nd Roma nia n offi c e rs, 
I we nt with Russians.  I was kind 
of a str eet ur chin for awhile.  I 
enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody
 c an re ally give me  any orders . 
And my mot her could 
not contr ol me either , you know?   I wa
s now a ma n a nd I wa
s just intoxicated 
by this, and so I had a little
 stor e ther e, that, wit h all the st olen
 goods , and my fath
er sa w thi s  whe n  
he ca me home a nd found out , as ked 
me what happened and 
I t old hi m.   And he wa s absolut ely j ust 
horri fi ed t hat  I would do s o methi ng l i ke this a nd ma
de me t ake ever ythi ng back t o the st ores where I  
got it fr om.  It was intere
sting, he got a little cart 
for me, we put everything 
on it and he came with 
me and he st aye d outsi de  and I ha d t o  deli ver it 
ba ck.  And I te ll you, some
 of those  pe ople could  
not belie ve t hat thi s ha ppene d.  And toda y, of course
, I fe el ve ry good a bout this but not, not at tha t  
ti me .  So, i n, it took me only a ye ar or two to r
ealize that  I, my real emotions that I™ m not a 
Hungaria n, I  never had a Hu
ngaria n passport , you know?   I ne ve
r ha d any, any identit y, Hungaria n 
identi ty.  They, I wa s al wa ys be
ing deni ed of bei ng a Hungar ian 
e ven t hough my pare nts were bor n 
in Hungar y and practi cal ly eve r ybody bac k ge ner atio
ns born in Hungary and 
so I joined the Zionist  
Move ment .  And in 1948, the, t h
e, the Communists co mpletely to
ok ove r the gove
rnme nt.  They 
called it the Yea r  of Tur n.  And all other or gani
z ations exc ept for Communist youth orga niza tions 
wer e banne d .  So a gai n now I  was  in 
t h
e under ground Zionist  orga niza tion.

A:  We ll, I t old you, be fore , 
that, it, we knew because 
of an e mis s ary t hat  he  had s ent  ahea d of hi m who 
then by s ma l l dosage ma de us a w ar
e of the fact t h at he 
was ali ve, that  he was 
coming, but of course, 
it was a tre mendous emotional experi
ence for hi m t o appear there and,
 the fact that he immediately

understood why th
ere are two families living in the apartment 
and, and, and accepted our decision, it 
wa s just a ve ry nice home coming. 
 Because number one, 
we  sa w hi m,  nu mber 
t w o he  brought  food, 
which helped us to have a little fe as
t then, and number three is that 
he, we knew that 
that™s what he 
would ha ve done, he would have 
split the living quarter
s a nd would not t hrow 
a fa mi l y  o f fo ur ,  
fa mi ly of five wh o were out of 
t heir  own, we ll, pr oble m
s ,  housed in our  pl ace.  We – natur ally, we  
were totally just overwhel
me d by e motions for a whi le a nd then, se
t out to see the re st
 of the family. 
He  want ed t o s ee his  br others  a nd sist ers a n
d, and, that™s, this 
is wh at happened.   
 
Q:  So you ha d l eft , whe n did you, 
let™ s go ba ck a 
little bit again. 
 

A:  Yea h .  

 

Q:  You ha d l e ft the, the ho
use on Zichy Jeno Street. 
 

A:  Ye s.Zich y 
utca
.  Yeah, I left it practically the day after 
we  were l i ber a t e d and we nt  back t o se e  
what happened to our apart ment .  
And that™s where I found t hat fami ly
 living in it.  ‚Kay?  And, then 
short l y we  move d bac k wit h my mo
t her a nd so a fte r a fe w mont hs, 
I thi n k it must ha ve been Apri l 
or M ay whe n my fat her  finally a ppe ar ed. 
 

Q:  And you, during tha t  fe w mo
nths , food wa s very s carce?  
 

A:  It was, very scarce.  
But agai n, this aunt of ours , of mi ne , 
who pl aye d s uch a n i mportant role in 
savi ng all of us, a gai n, s he and I, we  tea med up a
nd we nt, which was ver y  cust omar y then for cit y  
people to do, took jewelry and poss
essions of the fa mily that we th
ought farmers migh
t like to have 
and we coul d put on our  bod
y,  and walked about, I 
would say, thirty, forty 
kilometer, about twenty 
mile s fr om Buda pest , a n d e xchange i t
 for food.  We  al so hired a pers
on with a horse 
to drag it back  
to Budapest.  It was mainly flour,
 lard, necessities, but of course, 
a horse was immediately a red fla g  
in, in the eyes of the Russians because they confi s
cate d ever y horse , everything that c o uld be use d  
for transport i ng t heir goods.  
And we were caught 
midway bet w een t his place and Budapest ,  
coming back, in a small Da
nubian village.  On theother side of the Danube
, there was a battle going 
on.  And we  kne w that it  does n™t a f
fe ct anyt hing, beca use t he Da nube
 is a very wi de ri ver and the  
Ger ma ns didn™t ha ve a ny me ans t o ge t over and w
hy would t h ey come  ove r , 
but there was a battle 
over  there because Trans-Da
nubia was not li berat e d ye
t.  And so t he Russi ans
 were ver y edgy and 
they confiscated the cart, they c
onfiscated the food,
 they confiscated t he hor
se and then, 
they also  
incarcerated my aunt and mysel f
.  And I have no i dea what ha ppe
ne d, but the next – my aunt wa s 
with me in the room and the, th
e Russian capt ain came i n and took
 he r out and she ca me bac k a  fe w  
hours later a nd s he sai d, ﬁDon™t worr y, e veryt hing is
 goi ng t o  be fi ne .ﬂ  And the ne xt morni ng, we  

wer e gi ven back t he car t, the ho
rse, the man wh o wa s the owner of
 the hor se and car t a nd t he food 
and e veryt hi ng else a nd l et go.  And I  can onl y guess wh
at wa s the price
.  The onl y thi ng I regret is  
that we hear d that aft er deliveri ng 
t he  stuff to our home a nd s h aring 
it with the fa mily, when the, the 
far mer whos e, who had t he horse 
and the cart went back, event ually
, was c aught and lost bot h.  S o  
yes, if you had still so me belongi
ngs that farmers would 
appreciate, you could 
have food.  Because 
the far mer s a l wa ys  ha ve  food. 
 

Q:  How long di d t hat car
t f ul  of food last  you?

Je wish or ga nizat i ons were als o

 So that helped
 too.   We  were
 not really, you 
know, in danger of, of
 st a rving t o deat h. 
 
Q:  And did you go 
ba ck to sc hool?  

 

A:  Ye s, I we nt bac k to school, to hi gh sc hool, and ev
entually finished pr actical
ly, my hi gh s chool at the  
age of eight een.  And j u st a fe
w we eks be for e, practi cally, of fini shi ng, my Zionist Or gani zati on 
give  me si gnals that it wa
s time to go to Israel 
bec ause  the y c o uldn™t guar a ntee t hat we would ha ve  
more time.  The Commu nis
t Police  wa s a nd the  bor der guards we
re  reall y  clos ing e ver ythi ng ver y 
tightl y.  So, I, my in
structions were to say goodbye to my fa mi
ly and get either an
 inst r u ment or a n 
instrument case, that was instruct
i on number one.  Then I  was calle
d by my  Zi onist 
leaders and, and 
asked if it is true that my mother
 c o mes fr om thi s nort her n Hungari an town, I sai d yes .   They s aid, 
ﬁDo us a fa vor .  Go to that tow
n, i n troduce your sel f as , so t h ey 
can recognize t hat you are, your 
mother is related,ﬂ and all this 
a nd t hat, ﬁand as k the m i f t h ey wo
uld li ke to ha ve a high sc hool  
orchestra to play a concert in tow
n.  And i f t he y say yes ,ﬂ Šwhi ch 
proba bly t hey wo
uld, they said, 
because which little town doesn™t like
 a free concertŠ ﬁgo to a printer, here is
 money and 
have nice  
post ers pri nt ed.ﬂ  And they gi ve me t he dat e.  I 
went, I tal ke d to the ma yor , he was ove r whel me d, I  
we nt to t he printe r, I ha d all t he pr
ints made and I didn™t reali ze at 
that time that this was the alibi  
just in case we woul d be
 caught because thi s to
wn is on the way t o the border, my mot her™ s 
birthplac e.  On a gi ve n day, we 
boarded the bus, t he bus wa s a  st
ate- owne d bus by t hat ti me from a  
state- owned company.  
We  were all either holding an instrume
nt or havi ng an i nstr u me nt c a se  s o  
people thought thi s was  a high s chool orc hestr a 
and whi l e si ngi ng Communis t songs, we took off  

for the border.  On t he border, wh
en we got close to this town, we
 kept on goi ng a nd the bus dri ver  
said that he wa s hungr y, we
 wer e hungry too s o we stoppe d in a,
 in a ce rtai n pub or s o a nd thi s was  
in 1948, February.  We wer e eatin
g t here a nd gett ing s o met hing to 
dri nk a n d a woman bega n to flirt 
wit h the bus drive r .  And we we
re hor rifi ed because th
at would, everyt hing would c ause  a probl e m, 
we , we kne w t hat we had a de fi nite
 plan.  And soon the bus  drive r 
said that he would like to take 
about a hal f an hour rest
 and my, our  leader ar gued
 with hi m but he s aid, ﬁA
ll right, go.ﬂ  And as 
soon a s he disappear ed, he gathere d us a nd he  sa
id, ﬁ Go across t his fi eld an
d ther e is a bar n t here  
and don™t as k any questi ons , 
just get into the barn.ﬂ  That™s what
 we di d.  The y cl ose d the ba rn a nd  
around mi dnight, or s o, or later ,
 we we re mar c hed down t o the 
Ipoly River which is the river 

bet wee n Cz echoslova kia  and Hung
ary and to our great amazeme
nt, who was  le adi ng us? Št h e  
peas ant woma n who was in the pub. 
 She shed her twelve skirts or
 so beca use t hos e wome n sti ll 
wore ma ny, ma ny s kir
ts, this was the, the thin
g.  Now s he ha d a  leat her  
j acket  a nd bl ue j eans a nd 
she sp ok e Hebrew wi th our leader.  She was a, an 
Israeli army officer, bo
rn t o
 Hunga r ian pare nts  
wh o spoke perfect Hungarian
 a nd thi s was her job, t o di stract . 
 And she led us down to the river, 
ever ythi ng wa s s uppose d to
 happen so that on the 
ot her  side of t he ri ver , this was Cz e choslovaki a 
and t he re as on we had t o go t o Cze choslovaki a 
and not t o Austria beca use t he border bet we en  
Au stria  an d Hu ng ary  wa s al
re ady c losed and ti ght ly c ontr olle d but 
the Czechs  were s
till kind of in  
bet wee n thi s  Yea r  of Tur n and th
e Democratic regi
me that was there before.  The, t h e end, at t he 
end we cros sed the ri ver  but inste ad of getti ng int o
 the truc ks , the bor der guards stayed and starte d 
to talk right there whi ch wa s odd and very pai n
ful  because the r e was s now on the gr ound.  It wa s  
very c old in Februar y, we were  wet a nd we had t o 
lie on the ground for abou
t a half an hour wh en 
they finally left .  Then we
 couldn™t fi nd a tr uck, t he tr uc k le ft , 
too, who wa s suppos ed t o wait for us . 
So it took us about a half a da
y t o find it a nd, finally, we were
 taken to Bratis

gendarmerie was paid off.  We we
re nomi nall y ar reste d by t he  gend
armerie and he put into a warm 
place i n the synagogue, t here wa s str aw on t he fl
oor , I re me mber, and the 
next mor ni ng, we were  
take n to the railroa d stati on, put in boxcart s [s ic ] a
nd withi n about a hal f a n  hour the y opened.  We 
were in Vienna, in the American se
ction of, of, of Vienna.  At that
 ti me , Vi enna was  divide d.  So  
this was my, my gr eat escape t o 
Is rae l .  And from t here on, of 
cours e, we were ta ke n down a nd  
eve ntuall y e nde d up in Is rael. 
 
Q:  You me nti o ned how you had joi ne d
 this Zionist organiza
tion that you realized
 tha t you, you were  
not  reall y a Hungarian ci tizen. 
 

A:  Rig h t .  

 

Q:  Wa s it  t he de sire t o ha ve a pl ace  tha t

A:  Ye s.  I me a n, t he y, t he y , they, 
I felt that I was among 
br othe rs and sister s and I felt Šat t hat ti me 
remember it was th
e last fe w weeks of the warŠ
t hat I was, i f I fought, I 
was going t o fight for , for  
the Jewi sh homeland.  And I already associated myse
lf more with that than
 with Hungary.  That 
wa s, every young per son ne
eds a fa therland  and that was mine , even
 though I™d 
never seen it  before .  
So, it  was  a n  e moti onal t h ing and I  st a y
ed in Israel for t w
o day, two years. 
 

Q:  How di d your par ent s re la te to your  de cision, to . . . 

 

A:  Of c our se, t hey we re ver y, very upset  and ver y 
sa d.  But I sai d, ﬁ Y ou c a n come a nd, a nd j oin me ,ﬂ  
you know.  And we agre ed that t he y
 would but of cours e, t hey coul dn™
t , be caus e  a fter we le ft , it wa s  
i mpos sibl e t o, t o lea ve Hungary for  awhile .  So, Icorre sponded and this  wa s, t his was one of t h e  

reasons why I returne d event uall y, in 1950 to Hungar
y, ‚cause I realized t hat I needed to ma ke up  
for the years that my fat h er was aw
ay.  So I ret urned to Hungary an
d it was the worst of the Stalinist 
era.  It  was li ke 
1984
, it  was te rribl e.   
 

Q:  Did he, did your father identi
fy hi msel f as a, did he feel  a 
Hungarian na tiona lis m i n a ny wa y?  
 

A:  No, my fathe r  neve r reall y made

One wa y or  anot her .  J us t , he, he , he  l ove d his e nvi

coffee and, and, probab

And he told us a cute litt

always aske
d him why doe
sn™t he 
follo w me,  wh en  he  was  alre
ady al one, after  my mother
 died and he, he said, ﬁI

An d Mr. Kohn said, ﬁLook son,

son, I am alr eady in the 
coffee house.ﬂ  And 
my father al ways said, ﬁThi

other words, this was his life, th

 and he  was also wor ki

a holi c and he kne w that i n thi s  
country, you need
 language.  And he had very
 poor language fa cilities, he
 would have never learned 
English.  So, it was 
a  re al ization but  we, we  s aw hi
m as much as we  could.   
 
Q:  What  di d you do whe n
 you arri ved in Israel? 
 

A:  Bas i call y, I s pent mo st o f my ti me

I learned to work with the tractors

youth, most of the m

Q:  Did you play any role in
 the War of Independence? 
 

A:  Ver y little, a l most none .  I got there very late , re me mber , so I do not clai m any, a ny rea l  maj or role  
at all .  No.   
 

Q:  And t he n you deci ded 
to come  ba ck i n 1950?  
 

A:  In 1950, the n, it was pa r t  of a home s ickness for my
 pare nts a nd pa rt of st upi dity on my part , that I  
belie ved t hat  things ar e t he way Communi st pa pers
 des cribe it in Hungary.  I deci ded to r etur n,  
perhaps  te mporar ily, per haps not .  
And whe n I  a rrive d i n Hungar y, I 
real ized that  
it was a fatal 
mistake. 
 

Q:  Ha d you found any of t ha t
 se nse  of home  that you we
r e l ooking for  whe n . . . 
 
A:  No .  
 

Q:  when you went t o I srae l ?  

 

A:  No, no.  I found my pa
re nts, but ot her  than that
, it wa s, it wa s a  terrible  peri od for a ny human bei ng ,  
especiall y peopl e who came fr om
 the We st.  It was t he worst 
for t h ose , beca us e you wer e  
considered unreliable and especi ally 
coming fr om Israel, even mo re so. 
 Th e reason was, that by that  
ti me , Stal in wa s very pa ranoi d and Zi
onism was one of his ma
in targets.  So, it, it, this is, this is 
something that is not much to do 
with the Holocaust anymor
e .  It wa s just very
 hard for anybody t o  
live under Communist rule at that 
time , but e spe cially for J e ws .  
Well , I don™t know if you know  
that in 1953 when he wa s  dying, he l o oke d up a nd he sa w some  Jewi sh doct ors around his deat hbe d 

and he  sai d, ﬁThey are  pois oni ng me, t hey™ r e a gai
nst me .ﬂ  And he sai d, ﬁ A rrest  t he m.ﬂ  And 
practi cally hours be fore he di ed, the y arre sted Je
wish doct ors and I was j ust at t he Univer sity i n  
Hungary, studyi ng a nd that
 was my st ate, the ti me
 of my state exami nati o
n.  And Hungary ha d to  
follow e ver ything that t h e Soviet Uni on di d s o th
ey were looki ng for any
body who had anyt hing to 
do wit h Zi onis m.  And they foun
d me at the university
 a n d I was l et go, we
eks before my state 
exam.  So, it, it was diffic
ult but  of c o urse  that has  not hing t o
 do with the Holo
caust anymore.   
 

Q:  Whe n you had be en i n I srael , 
ha d you, do you fe el, di
d you feel that you ha
d found s o me of what  
you wer e l ooking for t her e?  
Was your intent ion t o go?

A:  Ye s and no.  Ye s and no
. I had some very dee p fe elings about 
the country as such and t hen agai n, I  
was still a young man, eighteen, and 
I was also influenced by a grea
t deal of these revolutionary 

Marxist ideas.  And ther e were many
 thi ngs  that wer e not
 to my liking, that 
I woul d have loved to  
see di ffere nt ly.  And so when I le ft
 Israel, I did not just leave it w
ith nostalgia.  I 
left it because I 
thought that fi nally, someho
w, in Hungary, I™ m goi ng t o find, fi nd t h
at utopi stic state, 
that, that is, is 
justic e and e qualit y for e veryone.  And, I was j ust 
a little bit t oo st upi d, to, to
 t hink tha t  way, but I  
did.  So it  a  wa s a , a 
double r eas on to return. 
 A, a totall y unfounde d 
i deali s m and home sickness. 
 

Q:  What  di d you do for  wor k
 wh en you returned home? 

 

A:  I coul dn™t work for a w hi le beca use I wa s unr elia
ble, anybody who 
came fr om t he We
st , especiall y  
fr om Israel.  Finally, with some  
gr eat connecti ons, I was hired to 
s we ep and cle an a gar age , a state-
owne d gara ge.  And that would have  
been my fut ure for a long ti me, ha
d it not been for a, just a, a 
very fort una t e inci de nt when t he Part y sec r etar y 
o f my , my  c o mp an y was  s i
ck a nd a substit ute Part y 
secret ary was ther e.  An
d I a ppe are d at her offi
ce because t here were big 
poster s, t hey wante d 
wo rkers youth to go to 
college because t hey figur e that some
 of t he mi ddl e class and t he for mer  
upper class that sends its sons to college and I as
ked if she can recommend 
me and she said, ﬁ Well,  
I don™t know you but why do
n™t you dictate a rec o mmendati on to 
my secr etary? ﬂ  And so that was  
the bi g fir st hur dle that I we nt thr ough beca us e th
e regul ar Par t y secre t ary would have never writ te n 
that letter.  So, with this, I we
nt to a uni ver sity forum, but t he 
trouble is you had to write your  
autobiogra phy, a nd the mi nut
e  they got  to a poi nt of Isra el, whic
h you could not in those days just 
stay silent a bout t wo yea r s of your
 li fe, whe n t hey found out t hey 
said ‚Thanks but no thanks,™ and 
agai n a str ange thi ng happened.  
One of the faculty members who 
was on the comm
itt ee, cause the 
committee that interviewed people
 consisted of fa culty me mber, 
Commu nist Youth 
Organization, 
the Communist Par t y, t h e union, va ri ous  or ga niza
tions .  He c a me a ft er me and he  sai d, ﬁ Holc zer , 
Hol czer ,ﬂ he said, ﬁwas your fat her
 fr om t he subur b of Budapest?ﬂ I 
said yes.  He sai d, ﬁWas there a 
socc er tea m in whic h he and four  or fi ve of his  br
othe rs pl aye d at the sa me
 time?ﬂ I said yes. H e  
said, ﬁI  pla y ed wit h your  da d.ﬂ  
 He said, ﬁCome back in Sept embe
r ,ﬂ he s ays ﬁ You were a mi nor 
wh en  y ou l e ft  Hu
ngary.  Let™ s see i f t he mi ni ster of 
education can exempt
 you,ﬂ you know? 
Amnest y you, par don you, whate ver .  Well , anywa y
, I we nt bac k in Sept
e mber  and nobody kne w  
who I  was , nobody, th
e y had no ide a, go a way.  
So I l ooked for hi m and he
 went in to the Party 
secret ary and he  ca me  out a nd he sai d, a nd he  sai d, 
ﬁ I  a m ha ppy t o i n for m  yo
u that t he  mi nist er of  
education gi ve you a dis pen

said, ﬁThis is the last  
ti me you and I ever talk t o each other . ﬂ  He said, 
ﬁDon™t even greet me.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou don™t know 
me.ﬂ  And that was it.  
This is how I got in.  Ye ah.   So  it 
was t wo coincidences, ver y l u cky ones.

Q:  And you sta yed, 
you studied what?  
 

A:  I studied, my  major wa s geograp
hy and my mi nor  wa s history.  
 

Q:  Wh at  were  y ou inter e
sted in doing after yo
u gained yo
ur degr e e?  
 

A:  I want ed to be a geogra pher .  I wanted to wo
rk for the Geographi c Instit
ute of Hungary or teac h 
geogra phy.  I love ge ogr aphy.  And, 
in Hungar y, it wa s a ve ry important subject at that time.  But in 

Ameri ca, it was no subj ect at all.  I ,  when I arri
ved here , pe ople wer e just 
looking at me and they 
said, ﬁ No, this is, unfort u natel y, we ar e not tea chi ng
 geogra phy here .ﬂ  It wa s incor porate d into what  
they call ed s ocial  st udie s in t he high s chool. 
 

Q:  So, a fter  you . . . 

 

A:  So, I s wit ched a nd I ma de, I we
nt back t o sc hool her e in 1
959, a nd s w itche d and had a hist ory 
maj or, ‚kay.  And I left  geograp
hy just out ther e, I di dn™t t ouc h 
it anymore, so I got a master™s 
degr ee i n his tory and my secondary 
cr edentials, t eaching credentials. 
 

Q:  After you graduated fr om, 
fr om college while you were 
i n Hungar y, what
 did you do? 
 

A:  The n I ta ught in a junior high sc hool i n the s u
burbs of Bu dapest, working-
cl ass suburb i n Budape st 
until  1956, when the Re vol utio
n broke out  a nd I l eft .   
 

Q:  Did you play any sort of
 r ole i n t he  Re vol ution?  
 
A:  Just a very mi nor one.  In the 19
th
 district of Bu dapest, I wa s as
ked  to for m th e Ne w De mo cra t ic  
Teac her s™ Union.  And I had ver y a m bival ent  feeli
ngs  about  the revolution be
cause I was afrai d t hat  
the same elements, t he same kind 
of elements who came  up in 19
44, October 15, ev
entually will  
domi nate it.  I just did not trust the r evol ution so
 I stayed a w ay fr om it.  I under stood the anger of 
the peopl e and I sympat hized with t h
e , wit h the de sire to have a fr ee count r y, but I di dn™ t trust s o me  
of the groups that partic
i pate d i n it .  And what , 
what r eally preci p
itated my departur
e is that a fe w 
days before I left, I saw 
some  gr oups  wit h Arr o w Cr
oss  ar mba nds , a nd that  did 
it.   I realized that I  
would neve r be a ble  to live he re 
anymore.  There will  be absol ute
ly no, no peace 
for somebody who  
is eit her  a huma n bei ng or, or has  a  Je wis h ba
c kgr ound or  favors a  pe ace ful  livi ng, li fest yle. 
 

Q:  Ha d you e xperienc ed dir e ctly any a nti- Se miti s m?  

 

A: All the time.  Hu
ngarians are with th
e Austrians and Pole
s, probably the thre
e most anti-Semitic  
countries in Europe.  I fe lt much 
less anti-Semitism fr ankl
y i n  Ger ma n y in my ni netee n  years t hat I  
recent ly spent t here than in
 Hungary or i n Austria. 
 

Q:  So you decided t o l eave Hungary. 

 

A:  Yes, I deci ded to l eav
e Hungary and in 1956, Nove
mber, I started to walk to
ward t he border wi th a 
cousin of mine who just gradua
ted fr om high school a
nd was always in political trouble with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
35 
 
 
police for his outspoken a
ttitude, so, he followed, he 
came with me, and we 
then crossed the border 
after, I think about six,
 se ven days  or  s o.  And arrived i n Austri a . 
 
Q: Wa s it difficult to l
eave, did you need any ex
it visa or any . . .  
 

A: No, it was totally illegal.
  We were walking usua
lly from dawn to dusk a
nd whatever the conditions 
wer e , you know, fa vor abl e , we
 di dn™ t really li ke t o  wal k in broad 
da yli ght but of c our se we c oul dn™t  
wal k in the darkness eit her becaus
e we  didn™t know the terrai n.  We slept in, in ha yloft s, t he far mer s  

were quite kind.  They 
felt probably a little 
bit guilty for not participa
ting in the revolution and 
slowly approached the bord
er this way.  And then be
fore the border, it was th
en a little bit difficult, 
and we had t o ha ve, we had connec
tions because a third person joined
 us whos e relati ve s lived i n a  
bor der town and they he
lped us to get over. 
 

Q: And then your pare
nts were still living–? 
 

A: Yes.  My parents were 
still there and I told them de
fi nitely that this time 
I want them to follow me, 
eventuall y, when t hey can come l e
gally.  Bec aus e I didn™t wa nt the m
 t o, t hey wer e  by that ti me , the  
age whe n you don™t just chas e so
me body a cros s s nowfiel ds .  So, we arr i ved in Gr az, t hat was the  
fir st Austria n town, a nd you ha d all  the opportunity
 to go then a nywhe re in the world.  Ever y  
country opened its arms. [dog 
barking]  Lie down, Gelsey. 
 

Q:  So  you arrived in, in Graz. 

 

A:  An d t h e wo r l d was t h e n  
ope n to us  a nd I i nte nde d to go t o Swe d
en.  I wa nted to s t ay i n Europe , a n d 
I just thought that Swe de n woul d 
be a good pl ace  for me t o, t o be. 
 But my cousin got away fr o m  
me while we were staying in Salz
bur g, i n, i n a hotel whic h wa s on
e of t he gathering points for the 
Hungaria n re fuge es, a nd l eft a note 
for me to come and fo
llow him.  And I promis
ed his mother t hat  
I wo uld take care of him so 
I followed him and 
this is how I ende
d up in the U.S. 
 

Q:  Yo u foll o we d h i m al l t he wa y t o t he  U.S .?  

 

A: Yes.  Well, of course, 
it was very easy.  All I had to do is 
go and tell the author
ities there, the, the 
one s who were in charge  
of the Hungarian refu gees that instea
d of Sweden, I chan
ged my mind and 
I want t o go to the U.S.
  Not only that, they al
rea d y, t he y alr e a dy ha d s o me  mess age s fr om the Re d 
Cross s ayi ng that i f I s how up, 
and the reason I was away, because 
pre viously he ha d a ske d me to  
go t o Vienna  and arra nge for hi m to
 stay with his relativ
es in Vienna who were
 not my relatives, but  
he wanted to go to school there.
  He was totally into
xicat ed by t he, by the 
light, we st ern li fe styl e  
beca use he had ne ver be e n to the We s t .  And by t h e 
ti me I ca me back t o Sal zbur g, he wa s gone.  So, 
but  he  le ft  messa ges .  So the Re d Cr os s se nt me 
t o St. Louis, Mi ssouri t o
 be  r eunit ed with hi m. 
 

Q:  Did you have any id
e a why he  would have done such
 a thing, of just leaving? 
 

A:  No, he , he was just , he was a ver y unpredi cta bl
e fellow, you know?   You c
oul d not re al ly, he wa s, 
he was a just  a restl ess pe rson an
d I t h
ink he fi gur e d, well , why not , 
I wa nt t o see  the  U.S. and, a nd 
his message to me was, ﬁYou can 
always go to Sweden fr
om the U.S.  You w
ill have the mo ney and 
opport unit y, but ma ybe  yo
u won™t have the opport
unit y to go a nd see  the 
U.S. if you live in

Sweden.ﬂ  Little, little di
d he know about economic
 conditions in the eigh
ties and nineties that, I 
think, mor e Swedes ca
n t ravel  much easier
 and come here than
 we in Sweden.   
 
Q:  Why di d you pre fer
 t o go to Sweden?  
 

A:  Yo u know, I am a roma n
tic.  And I just felt that 
I would not want to l eave 
Eur ope.  Eur ope , to me , 
wa s al ways  my home .  I 
love d t he  ol d t owns , a nd I al ways  loved c l arit y a n d t hat, the Scandina via n  
purit y, maybe, that  I ha ve s een too many, I  ha
d seen too ma ny Scandi
navi an movies, Swe dis h 
movie s.  But  they j ust a p peale d to me , the li festyl e . 
 And I li ke d the fa ct tha t  
the social securit y, t hat  
people ha ve in Sca ndi na vian countri es , espe ciall y in
 Sweden.  And just a l ot 
of things appealed to 
me  a bout Swede n, and I  kne w t hat  I woul
d be tr eat ed fairly, so, that was i t. 
 

Q:  And you ha d, yet you ha d en
ough money t o j ust  tra vel t o
 t he  U.S. instea d a n d . . . 
 

A:  No, I ha d no mo ne y.  We  didn™ t 
nee d any mone y. [ta l kover ]  No. 
 Nobody had a ny money.  All you  
did was as a refugee, you appeared
 at ,  wh en , whe n  we fi nall y wer e
 pic ke d up a nd t ake n to Graz by 
the Austrian police, they were very well orga
nized there, there, you found ever y religi ous  
denomination ha ving a boot h, who welcome d you.  Yo
u could go a nd sa y t hat I a m a Baptist , I a m a  
Cat holi c , ma de no di ffe r ence  and t he n na me t he co
untry where you wanted to
 go to.  An
d, and it 
wa s ver y si mple, you didn™t nee d 
a ny mone y.  The n, ne xt s t ep wa
s e ac h ha d a pl ac e in Aust ria  
where the y t e mpor arily would ho
use  you, eve n gi ve you a littl e 
pocket money a nd ther e you waite d 
for your tra n sport ation t o  go to t hat 
c ountry.  And that so, I di d not re
ally want to be attached to any 
religi ous  or ganizati on s o I went t o a very indepe
nde nt one  ca lled t he Tols t
oy Foundati on.  It was  

founded by Tolstoy™s daugh
ter and, using I think th
e, the royalties of Tolst
oy™s books, and so they 
are the ones who brought me to th
e U.S.  It was all gratis.  I cam
e over, the Ameri
can military and 
the Air Force is the one 
who fl e w all  Hungaria n re
fuge es over.  M ATS, Mil itary Air  Tra nsportati on , 
the, t he stewardesses and al most ever ybody i nvol ved 
with us wer e  o f, o f Hu
ngarian origin, most of 
them from C l eveland.  Cl eveland is
 the second lar gest  Hu
ngarian city in the wo
rl d a fter  Budape st.  
And, a nd so here , t he y t hen, t h
en I wa s handed over to
 a Je wis h organiz ation be ca us e my cousi n  
ca me t hrough a  Je wis h orga niza tion.
   So  in  St. Lo uis the y wer e  
waiti ng for me .  I f you were a  
Hungaria n r efugee t hose  da ys , you had no pr obl e m 
because t he world, t h e 
whole wor l d fel t  very  
guilt y about  not hel pi ng the Revolut i on a nd s o t h
ey did e ve r ythi ng pos s i ble.  I mea n I wa s so  
e mbarr asse d.  I never, I wa s never in my li fe tre ated thi s wa y, I thought, you know, I was s o me  

dignitar y or somet hing.  The y were
 waiti ng for me at t he air port a nd 
I was just–  But fi rst I had to 
spe nd, like most Hunga r ians , so me
 ti me  at C a mp Kil mer in  Ne w Je rse y  whi c h wa s a scree nin g  
ca mp for pe ople .  They scree ned 
out  the sick, the U.S. did not ta
ke , I thi nk, people wit h TB and 
some ot her il lness es , the y  went t o Sc a ndi navi a,
 the Swedes did, and also
 Communist Party members 
and such.  I don™t know wh
at the criteria was, but 
they looked into your ba
ckground a little bit.  And 
so this is how I ended up in St. Louis.  My c
ousin stayed with me fo
r a bout no mor
e than t wo  
months, not even that mu
ch.  He found s o me r e la
tives in Chicago who woul
d help him to go to 
Champagne, the Univer
sity of Illinois, and he ju
st left .  And we were hous
ed, we were taken by an 
Ameri can fa mil y who ha d ver y good intent ions 
but the man was a manic depres sive so you c oul d 
never fi gure out for one s econd to 
a nother how he would re act t o you. 
 And, apparently, his wi fe felt 
that ma ybe t aking Hunga rian re fu
gees  in woul d, woul d some how re me
dy the problem but it didn™t. 
And t hey ha d a me ntall y retarded 
c hil d, s o it wa s not a  ver y i d eal si
t uati on for a ne wc omer  although 
she was ver y  nice to me and I st ayed there for a 
few months and then even
tually, I met a professor 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

of Hungari a n ancestr y a nd origi n at
 the University of, Washington 
Uni vers ity in St. Louis who had 
in As pe n, Colora do, a hous e, and 
he  and his fa mil y spe nt e very s u mme r  there be ca use he wa s a  
member of t he musi c festival .  
 And when t hey heard– I hated 
St . Louis, I just c oul dn™t fi nd  
anyt hing r edee ming a bout that , t hat
 ci ty, and when they 
hear d t hat I  was ver y unhappy a nd all t his, 
they t ook me to As pe n, Col ora do a n d the y said, 
ﬁYou ca n al wa ys wor k here for a dollar an hour, 
too.ﬂ  And I loved it.  I stayed there for al most th
r e e years.  And most of 
my fri ends and connecti ons  
and e ver ythi ng i n my Ameri ca n li fe practi cally c o
mes fr om that period.  
From my Aspe n peri od, 
people who helped me  to get a hea d 
in, in more ways than
 one.  So, I a m, I wa s ver y l uc ky a gai n t o  
end up t here .   Of course , t hos e days As
pe n wa s not  what  it i s t o day, you know. 
 
Q:  We re you t e achi ng the r e ? 

 

A:  I was , no, fr om As pe n was a pl
ace where I coll ect ed my
 mone y and, and, you know, sa ved e nough.  
I wanted t o go up to Alaska for 
one summer .  I  went up 
t o Alas ka a nd worked 
for the Forest Service  
and t he n ca me t o Fres no, Cali for nia , whic h offer ed 
me a l oa n .  I couldn™t get a s cholar ship bec ause  
they didn™t know muc h a bout me.  
M y papers di d not arri ve fr om Hu
ngary.  So it was, but at least 
they offered me a Nati onal
 Defense Loan so that helped me to 
start sc hool.  And I staye d in Fre s n o  
for t w o year s whe n I got  my teac hi
ng cr edential s  and my ma ster™s de
gre e  in hist or y.
  And I , those  
wer e, s chola sticall y spea king, t hey were good ye
ars.  I had very good 
ins tructors a nd, and good 
fri ends a nd s ponsor s and, I did not
 re gret it.  And t hen I ended up 
i n the Bay Ar ea wher e I wanted t o  
be.  And met my  wife th
e r e.  And I  wa s tea chi ng
 in Mari n County.   
 

Q:  We re you i n touc h wit h your
 par ent s t hroughout t h is . . . 
 

A:  Ye s.   All  the  ti me.   And  I , al mo st  e v
er y s u mmer  I we nt home  t o visit , oka y? 

 
Q:  Weret her eplans 
for them to come?  
 
A:  Ye s.  They, onc e I got married in
 ™ 67, they came t o visit and t hey 
e njoyed it very mu
ch and then in 
1974, when, see I marr ied my wi fe wit h thre e  child
ren.  They were tiny,
 their , t heir fat her  
aba ndone d the m, he wa s  alcoholic . 
 And so, my wi fe a nd I ra ised 
the m.  And by t he t i me , 1974, I 
get an offer fr om a fr iend of mi
ne in Switzerland to come and help
 hi m, he was a di r e ctor of a  
school in a children™s village in 
Switz erland, Pesta l ozz y, ver y fa mous c hildr en™s  vill age , Pest aloz z y  

Children™s Village.  
Do you speak German? 
 

Q:  No .  

 

A:  No .  Ok ay .  An d so , a n d  
I loved the mountains, I l
ove d t he  Al ps and I  wanted 
to get back to Europe. 
And si nce we had onl y one chil d at home by that t i me ,
 and he was willing to co
me so we we nt over . 
We , we  resi gne d our j obs and we we
nt back and t he j ob fell through.
  Because i n t he meanti me, t he  
Swiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about 
not hiring foreigners un
less they can find a local  
person for the job.  And after year

deci ded ye s, but  during t he year , 
I got to know a l ot of pe opl e in 
the system, in th
e  De part me nt o f  
De fense School System.  So now that
 the j ob fell  t hrough a nd we ba si
call y gave up our jobs  he re i n  
the State s, I had onl y one , you know
, opport unit y here , to go over a
nd see i f a ny of our , our , any of  
my  for mer colleague s can be
 found a nd i f  I ca n get 
any help t o ge t a j ob fo
r my  wi fe and mys e l f.  
And not only that I found some bu
t they were now in very, very 
high positions and they said, no 
proble m.  And bot h of us, wit hi n
 a  year , sta r te d to t eac h.  My 
wi fe got a job e ve n be fore me , 
beca use it was mor e di ffi cult for hi gh school t eac he
rs t ha n ele me ntar y.  So she starte d out a nd we  
lived in the Frankfurt area and 
we stayed for  ninet een years. 
 
Q:  How di d you meet  your  wife?  

 

A:  We , whe n I  left s c hool  wit h my
 cr edenti als, I  wanted t o, I had 
a  gi rl frie nd in the  Ba y Are a , als o 
fr om As pe n.  She was a  schoolte ac
he r and s he wa nted me 
t o get a j ob ther e so 
we c an be cl ose  a nd 
we were t her e.  Now all of a sudd
e n, she said, oh, at th
at time it was 
very, by t hat ti me  it wa s very  
di fficult to get a job for a teach
er, in the early sixties, and th
e onl y job avail able, fi nall y, was 
teachi ng special ed classes.  And I 
said, children are chil dren, I  don™t 
care.  I had t o si gn a paper that  
I would go t o school and get a cre de n tial.  And th
e  ma n who hi red me wa s a l so a Hol oca ust s urvi vor  
so it, it reall y helped.  I told hi m very hone stly 
why I want t he job and I sai d, ﬁIt does n™t  matter wh y 
I want t he job, I will , I will do a good job, you ca n, 
you can bet  on that .ﬂ  And I hope I did.  So, he  
hired me and this i s where I met 
my wi fe.  She was al so teachi ng 
speci al ed classes, and but she 
stayed only for a few years and t hen
 when I came  back i n
 1965, then I we nt in
to special ed for the 
county, for Marin Count y, and 
I stayed for al most  ten years, ni ne y
ear s.  So that™s 
ho w we met .   An d  
then I switched.  With 
the Army, I switched
 back to teaching political 
science and, and history. 
 

Q: Wh at was it like 
l ivi ng in Ger ma ny all  those  ye ars?  
 
A: We ll, it was much more 
pleas ant t ha n I ha d envi sion
ed, frankly.  I found that
 there is a very large  
segment of a ne w Ger man ge
neration that is, is abso
lutely appalled, okay, of
 the past .  And I  met a  
lot of i ntelle ctuals  who had a ver y good visi on 
of the past, and not only 
t hat, they spr ead t h e 
knowl edge a r ound.  Nat ura
lly, there is an eleme nt 
in, in Germany, that is
, you know, that is the  
scum of e art h, but frankl y, t hey ar
e very much the minor
ity.  And I , I c oul d live in Ger ma ny muc h  
easier , probably, than I coul d ever live in Austria,
 where it doesn™t take more
 than a fe w minutes to  
hear  so mebody maki ng a n a nti- Se miti c or  fa scist  r e ma
rk, especially if they 
have a couple of beer . 
You know.  So, ther e is, t here is a new Ger many.  No
w, wit h East Ger ma n y join
ing, it is a problem.  
But We st Ger many itsel f, wa s, I would sa y, a pr etty
 civil ized state.  Okay
, now the Ea st Ger ma ns ,  
that™s a di fferent, that™s a, that™s
 a tra g edy ri ght now, that t he y had 
not bee n  instr ucte d by the proper 
history teachers, and, ther e are bi
g pr oblems in East Ger
many becau
se t he East Ger mans sai d, ﬁThe 
Naz i s, oh no, the y live i n West 
Germany.  We , we are good Co mm
unist s here , we don™t have to 
worry about the past.ﬂ  And this 
attitude then led to what is ha
ppening nowadays in Germany with 
the ski nheads. 
 
Q: Wa s it difficult at firs
t for you to a cc ept that 
Ger ma ny wa s s o, t hat you c
oul d reall y get along wit h  
some  of thes
e Ger mans? 
 

A:  We ll, again, you know, I followe d 
my father.  He ca me to see us 
in Ger ma n y onc e and whi l e he was  
there, our landlady™s son 
was killed in a motorcycle
 accident, a young sevent
een year old, a young

ma n.  And we ha d to go to t he funeral.  And my
 wife said to my fath
er a s s he l ook ar ound, 
ﬁGr andpa , l o ok, all  these  me
n of your age .  Do you some ti mes  t hin
k of al l t h e ghosts t hat  are ar ound 
here behi nd these me n? ﬂ  And my fa ther sai d, ﬁ You 
ca n™t li ve with hate .ﬂ  He sa ys, ﬁThere are  
ghosts ever ywhere.  There are Indi
a n  ghosts in Ameri ca , too.  Yo
u ha ve your own ghosts.ﬂ  And 
that™s j ust t h e wa y that, you ca n™t c onstantl y thi
nk of that.  And we befrie
nd ed Ger ma ns wh o were a  
lot more even liberal than, than we
 ar e.  And s o, 
I me an, you c a n fi nd al l ki nds
 of peopl e .  That , but  
there, Germany, I don™t really 
worry too much a bout Ger ma ny as 
muc h as I worr y a bout Russ ia  
and, and Poland and Aust
ria a nd the r e you ca n find a l ot of 
fa scist elements and Hungary too, 
probably. 
 
Q:  We ™ve got a fe w more mi nutes.  So
, i s  ther e a nythi ng, what
 ma de you deci de to 
ret urn to the States? 
 

A: Oh, when, the, th
e military was in a, is, is 
a drawdown situation where they
 were pulling out quite a  
few troops from Ger ma ny 
and we r eached, my
 wi fe reached the poi nt 
where she j ust said she  
wanted to be close t o the childr en.
  We have four grandc hildr e n.  Sh
e , thi s house whi ch didn™t look 
like thi s at that ti me was a small littl e place, t his 
was one end of th
e house and that was the other end 
of t he house .  A part ner  of my
 brot her-i n-la w li ved he re, a veteri naria n, but  it was a ve ry s ma l l  
place.  It was avail abl e.  They 
bought it and he  called us a nd my 
wi fe said, ﬁLook, I stayed i n  
Eur ope for ninetee n year s wi th yo
u, now I woul d like you to stay wh
ere I would like t o
 be  and it i s  
so nice to be so close to family
.ﬂ  Our son is only four hours awa
y, in Nashville, w
ith a little baby. 
And oh, and she gets al
ong wit h her si ster ve ry well a nd 
we all get along, we never ha d a n  
argume nt .  So, that  was  a n i deal  si
t uat ion so that™s  how we got  here .

Q:  I 'm Arwen Donahue and 
I 'm here with Robert Holczer i n Par i
s, Kent ucky on Apr
il 29, 1996.  Thi s 
is a Uni t ed States Holocaust Me
mori al Muse um interv
iew.  And fi rst to– 
ask you a couple of 
questions about the issues that came
 up in t he last  intervi ew.  I  just wante d to get your a unt 's na me , 
for one  t hing, t he aunt whose  ap
art me nt you st aye d i n on Zi chy 
Jeno Street, wh at wa s her name? 
 

A:  Her na me was Aranka , t hat is 
Goldie  in Engli sh, you know, Ara n
ka, a nd Tepl y, T- E- P-L- Y.  She ' s  
still living in Hungary at 
this date and probably it 
would be very difficult 
to communicat
e with her 
because she is number one, old, 
and number t wo, I  think that she ha
s some me ntal pr obl e ms that she  
developed si nce the war and, but sh
e certai nly is t he heroi ne of the 
whole st ory a nd my s urvi val, so I  
try to keep up with her bu
t it's very, very difficu
lt and I'm very, very sorry 
about t hat .  But  she has a 
son who lives in Switzer
land so at this po
int she's still alive. 
 

Q:  
I didn't qui te  under sta nd how just
 go bac k a little bit, whe n you liv
ed i n the house on Zichy Jeno 
Street , be for e it bec a me  a  clin
i c, it wa s a  Je wi sh house. 
 

A:  Rig h t .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
40 
 
 
 
Q:  And yet  ther e were  s o me people  who 
l ived in the hous e who we re non- Je ws . 
 

A:  No n-J e ws, y e s.  

 

Q:  And I s uppose your a unt 
wa s considered one of them. 
 

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  But before the house wa s designat
ed a clini c, i f anyone in the house 
were t o  be li qui da– wer e to be  
put i nto the ghett o, woul
d they ha ve gone a part m ent by apar t me n
t, or  would t he y have taken t he  
entire house? 
 

A:  The y woul d ha ve  gone  apart me nt  by a part me nt  an
d, of course, if you co
uld pr ove  that you are  a  
gentil e, a nd that was ver y eas y bec a use e very c
onci erge ha d a list, yea r s ago t his wa s a la w in 
Hungary, that ever y concierge had a list and that
 had nothi n g to do wit h  Jews or non-Je ws wa y 
bac k, bec aus e whe n you cha nge  your  
residenc e in Eur ope, you have to 
go to the police 
a nd r eport it .  
In othe r wor ds, e ver y Europe an country, they know 
who is at that point where.  And so this list 
existed, all they had to 
do, come and talk to the concierge a
nd all t he c onci erge s were ba sicall y 
serving the government, th
ey were in my estima te
, what I call the common 
man, and their attitude 
cha nge d regarding of what the go
ve rnment wa s doi ng a nd they were
 la ckeys a nd s o
 t here was no  
big pr obl e m, they al wa ys  could te ll who were the 
gentil es and who were 
not by just showi ng t h e  
list.  But there were gentiles still
 living in the Jewish houses w
ho had a nice place 
and they just 
didn't wa nt to move, you know?   
And so when, for exa mple , at one
 ti me we were li ne d up beca us e  
the house was discovered an
d thi s George Ara Jereczian was not th
er e wit h hi s guards.
  I t hink t hey 
we nt t o buy, get some  ra tions  for  the  house , a nd 
so we were really wi thout a ny de fe nse, and we  
were lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently 

they had known wh at wa s going on 
and c oul d i de nt i fy t he ms elves.  
 

Q:  But you were lined up althou
gh you lived with your aunt? 
 

A:  We were, ye s, we were l i ned up
, we wer e line d up.  And t he n  in 
the last mo ment, a lot of things 
happe ned.  This a unt of mine, for 
example, she was also 
out, most people who c oul d go on t he str eet  
wer e al wa ys  out  looki ng for some thi ng t o e at 
a n d bri ng home and when 
she sa w her mother , for  
example, in the li neup, sh
e j ust we nt  up to her  a nd starte d t o  
kic k her a n d sai d, ﬁ Thi s  stupid slut . 
Just , s he  is s o st upi d.  Every ti me
 people say line up, s he l ine s  up, 
she's not Jewish.ﬂ
  And all this, 
and in front of those Arrow Cross 
pe ople , s he j ust  dra gge d her mother
 out of the line
 up and she had 
a pers onali ty that nobody argued with
 her.  So they assume that she 
is a genti l e, ther efor e her mot her  
is a gentile, too.  A
nd then we were saved 
because Geor ge Ara Jere
czian came 
home and 
i mme diat ely, his men i m me diate l y we
nt to these punks a
nd s aid, you know, ﬁ Cl ear out of here i n 
short  or der , papers a nd ever ythi ng e l se.  And i f
 you want , you know, we '
ll call the Ministry of 
De fens e.ﬂ   And so, t he y kne w t heir  job an
d t hreatened t hese pe
ople who then left. 
 

Q:  You me nti oned t hat  the r e wer e  a bout t e n pe
ople living in that apar
t ment  with your  aunt?  
 

A:  
About  te n, yeah, yea h.

Q:  An d so me  o f  the m were  
her br ot hers  a nd sist ers?  

 

A:  Ye s, t hey  we re, t hey were , I sta r t o ut wit h my mo
ther, then my fa ther's th
re e siste r s, oka y?   Among  
the m t his  Ar anka, Goldi e , a nd eve nt u
ally my fa ther 's  t wo brot hers , t o
o, joi ned us .  The y were  als o 
under some  kind of a  di s guis e a s 
poli ce men or  thi s and t hat  in what
e ver uni for m t hey c o uld get , but  
when things were really t
ough t he  last , I t hink, te n days or t wo 
weeks, they joined 
us , s o  the y wer e  
there, too.  Then t here were so
me hus bands , my, one of my a u nts 
ha d a hus band and a boyfri end.  It 
wa s a triangle that  the fa mily just tolerated be cau
se the boyfri end was a much
 nicer person than t he 
hus ba nd, eve r ybody, so t her
e was eve n humor the n.  
And some children.  So 
we might, it's possible 
we were e ve n more th an ten an d 
that wa s ver y for t unat e, a lot of apart me nt s have a l ot more tha n  
just ten people because this was, it sound like, it
 see med like  a safe have n and of c o urse , all the  
relatives we re c o ming a nd you wo
uldn't wa nt t o  thr o w out your re
l ative s a nd so... a  lot  of ver y  
famous doct ors were ther e who t hen
 we nt on and ca me t o t his  co
untry and elsewh ere and the whole 
fa mi ly was there, so.  
 

Q:  What about  her other brothers  an
d sis t ers, ot her t h an t hos e who we
re in the apartm
ent?  Where did 
they– were they
 at the time?  
 

A:  Oh, my a unt 's othe r, we l l , we 
were all together in 
the same apart ment , it
 wa s her apartment and 
because ordinarily a gentile wo
uld not have had anything to 
do with Jews, but this was a n  
extraordi nar y place becaus
e we, she knew t hat i f  
they reall y stor med th
e house , the  Arrow Cros s  
people, and i f they reall y eli min
at e George Ara Jer eczian and his gua
r ds, then everyt hing is lost , it 
doe sn't make  any di fference,
 so... and inside the house , of cours e, ther e wa s abs olute ly no othe r rul e  
exce pt you ma de  up your ow
n s o nobody c ared.  Ye s?  
 
Q:  But  s he  ha d, there  
were  thirteen all  together , sibli ngs, ri ght?  
 
A:  Yea h, ri ght .  

 

Q:  So ... 

 

A:  No, no, no, no, t hirtee n, 
my father ha d thirtee n br other s and si
sters and some of t he m wer e alrea dy 
dea d and others were  els e where .  
On e wa s in what wa s Sl ov aki a  at th
at ti me and par ticipated i n t h e 
Slova k upris i ng a gai nst t he Ger ma ns and was hang
ed, was captured and ha nge
d.  My fa ther wa s in  
Yugoslavia, so there were, another 
was i n a  la bor  ca mp, we  di dn't e v
e n know where he  was, s o t he y  
wer e dis pers ed.  The wome n were 
together, the women we c o uld get 
toget her and, but t he men, only  
two of them.  So  there were
 alt ogether  fi ve, fi ve of t he t hirte en, r i ght  the r e. 
 

Q:  Als o,  wh at wa s t he na me o f  th e ps yc
hiatrist, the famous psychiatrist who... 
 

A:  Völ gy e ssi , Völg yess i.   He  was  
the  mos t  fa mous  Hungari an psyc hi
atrist  of his , of t hat ti me . 
 

Q:  Woul d you s pell his  na me, plea se?  

 

A:  V- O, and there is a double, what the Germ
a ns  ca l l , what i s it , well , anywa y, two dots.

Q:  Umla ut.  

 

A:  Umla ut, yes ,  two dots on the O, 
the n L- G- Y-E - S- S-I, Vö lg yes s i.  
And he , he was a ver y influenti al  
man and I, i f I rememb
er  correctly, I heard, at  th
at  ti me  as a chi l d, t hat  he
 was the mai n r eason t hat 
this whole setup was the way it wa
s.  That  he had the connection,
 he kne w Geor ge Ara Jer eczi a n  
and he is  the one  who br
ought hi m in and suggested that let's do this. 
 

Q:  Do  you know what beca
me  of hi m a f ter the wa r?  
 

A:  He wa s in hi s, I would s ay, lat e 50's in 1945, 
but  he ha d a son and two daughter s and a relative l y  
younger wi fe, s o I ass u me that t h
ey are somewher e and I 
also assume that they
 are not in Hungar y, 
that they are probably in the U.S., so
 i f ever t here is a r eunion, I will
 see  t he m.  As a 
mat ter of fact, I  
would like t o see them becau
se I was deeply i n love 
with one of the, t he lit tle
 Völgyessi  girls.  I was 
a young ki d t hen, it  was  j ust a puppy l ove . 
 

Q:  Who el se of the gr oup that wa
s wit h you i n the a part me nt on Zich
y Je no Street s ur vived?   You a nd 
your a unt s a nd your  mot her?  
 

A: We ll, in 1945, we all surv
ived, okay?  Bu
t, oh you mean since?
  Who's still alive? 
 

Q:  So everyone we nt t hrough 
okay, went thro
ugh the war?  
 

A:  Oh , we we n t  thro ug h th e sa me 
e xpe rience and nobody... i n t hat 
house, the only people who were 
take n away wer e a ma n bet wee n ei
ghtee n and, I think it was e i ghte en a nd forty- fi ve or eight een a nd  
fi ft y-fi ve, before, before October 
15t h when the  l abor , whe n t hey tr
ul y we re just goi ng to a l abor  
camp, labor organizations, that 
is when all the me n, so ther
e were no me n until October 15th, 
between eighteen and fi fty-five in
 that house, they were all taken 
away.  So, some of the fa milie s 
who li ved there, for example, thei
r father was not with 
them by that time.  And, I don't know of 
anybody who s urvi ve d.  In ot her  wo
rds, unfortunately, mo st of these 
pe ople wer e t he n
 in a forced 
mar ch towar d Ger many at the end of the war and 
some where in, pr obabl y 
western Hungary, the y  
were just either kille
d or died of typhus. 
 

Q:  Did you keep in touch wi th an
yone el se fro m t he cl inic after  
the war , other t h an your fa mi ly?  
 

A:  No , n o ,  n o.  Yo u k n o w , I  wa s fi ftee n wh en t h e wa
r ended, and I regret  thi s  very muc h, but out side  
my family, my family is
 the onl y one , and t here ar e onl y two me
mbers living in my 
famil y and they 
are the only ones.  I tried to ask them if they 
can ma ke so me cont act, I a m
 now reall y very much 
intere sted i n kee ping up wit h some
 ot her pe opl e, but they, the y just , the y never reall y bot here d and 
they are not very good le tter writers s o, a nd i f I go 
to Hungar y, ma ybe I wil l  
look for it, I would like 
to a nd I 'm going to as k, pe
rhaps, i f I can get to t h
e, t o any, perhaps t o th
e synagogue in Hu ngary, if 
they have some know
ledge of, is t her e a group that still  come
s toget her, because t here wer e ki ds of  
my a ge  and I 'd like  to know what  ha ppene d t o t he m . 
 

Q:  Whe n you r eturned t o your a par

turning to your

A:  M mm- h m m.  

 

Q: We re your things, were you
 furniture, any of your belo

A: Yeah,interesti
ngly, well, there was 
very little left in our apartment, 
what was left, a couple of boxes, 
and I  don't know why t hey were le ft t here , t his
 fa mily ne ver touched.  And t hat , t o me, was 
i mme diat ely, I give the m  some go

direct hit when t he siege of Buda
pe st took pla c e and s o a l ot of
 the... a nd most 
of these boxes  
cont aine d ta blecl oth or s heets  or so
mething like that, and so they a

however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkin
s we had for a long time until they  
disintegr ated.  My wi fe mended the m and we us ed 
the m.  And now, what ha ppe ne d to the fur nit ure?  
A lot we give to neighbors to sa

, you will give it 
back to us and 
if we are not, then it is yours,ﬂ so
, and they took it and now not one of
 the m had a piece left that the y  
can give back to us. They all said the sa me  thin

No w,  thi s  wa s th e mo s t

was ridiculous, but not hi ng, a bsol u
tely nothing was returned from 
the nei ghbor s. 
 

Q:  Did any of your friends fr om 
before t h e war re
turn aft er war ds? 
 
A:  Any of my friends?  Wel l , as I 
me nti one d be fore, my clas s, j u nior  
hi gh cla ss, was pr
actically totally  
take n and de porte d under  thos e ve ry unus ual ci rcumst
anc es , so I had t o l ook for t he kids who we re  
not my s chool mate s, but, or either lower or highe r cl
asses, and also t he ones that I used to play wit h  
wh en I we nt  to t he 
city park which was not far 
a wa y fr om us .  And I  woul
d say that about half of 
them I found, but the othe
r hal f peris h ed, you know, either be c a
use of t he fi res, you know t here was 
bombs, or because th
ey were killed during the Arrow 
Cross era, afte
r October 15th. 
 

Q: You, in our last interview, had 
talked a little bit about meeting up with some of
 your friends aroun d  
Buda pest and that 
you would tal k a bout the 
war and that was exclusiv
e l y what  you woul d tal k  
about.  When you met up wi th 
them again after the war, wh
a t di d you tal k about  the n?  
 

A: We ll, when I met my fr iends af
ter t he war , n u mb e r  one , we we r e  so
 full of hatred, 
we we re looki ng 
for s o me kind of an outle t, s o me orga nizati on t hat  
we can joi n, and we found 
it.  And part of it was  
they give a wa y shi r ts, we found a Communist Part
y.  I m
a g ine, we wer e  fi ft een yea r  olds a nd we  
sa w t hat pe o ple we re wa l kin g ar ou
nd in re d, fla mi ng red s hirts .  
And we  found out 
that the fl aming 
red shirt s come fr om par achutes and these parach
utes were s u ppl y parac hutes that were  dropped by 

the Sovi et forces and t h e Hungar
ians got the material
 and the Communist Pa
rty ma de  a kind of a  
ca mpai gn a n d ma de it  int o
 s hirts  and would gi ve t he m t o a nyb
ody who si gned up. 
 And I t hink t his  
dre w us a lot mor e than anyt hing
 else, the four very close fri ends
 of mi ne, whom I knew fr om the 
illegal boy scout organization and, 
luckily, we all survived, we a
ll went and signed up with th e

Communist Part y a nd I think 
this is the first, or 
al most the last 
ti me , I  ever went t o the Part y 
beca use , now we we nt t o a c ouple
 of me etings a nd we wer e  just 
bore d to deat h, t his happe ned t o  
Ameri can communi sts, too.  Si gne d 
up or some thi ng, I mea n i t  wa
s the most bori ng t h ing, s o we  
never real ly considered oursel f trul y Communist 
Part y memb ers because we 
were, I think, members 
for a mont h and t he n we  never pa id
 any fees or we didn't do anyt hi
ng after that, bu
t this was, our  
first step was to go down to 
the Communist Party headquarters 
and si gn up with t he  Communi st  
Part y, whic h was under st andable beca use we felt th
at the Communist Party wa
s going to be the one 
that revenges all these atrocitie
s and whatever ha
ppened, and then we saw 
that almost everybody 
wh o wa s in  the Arr o w Cro ss mo v e me nt is als o  
in the Communist Party 
beca use  pe ople easil y  
turne d, t hat 's obvi ous, you know, 
a lot of books and essa ys wer e  writte n about ho
w anybody who is 
an extremist in one way can become
 t he e xtre mi st inŠon t he  other side
.  So we found 
that and that 
wa s dis gusti ng, absol utel y.  And 
the Communist Part y kne w about 
it a nd they de fe nde d it and we 
didn't l ike that, t heir t er minol ogy, and so we  quit.  
So  the n we  we nt b ack  to
, and kind of  regr ouped 
as ol d boy s cout s.  But our heart 
wa s not i n it bec ause  now, I me an
 for s o ma ny ye ars we could not  
do a nyt hing as boy sc out s exce pt go out a nd hike  in
 nat ure, we coul dn't e v en wear a ke rchie f .  And 
so now we c oul d we ar a uni for m an
d some of us really bought  a uni
for m, a nd the n we just, we jus t  
lost completely our lust 
for boy scout life and that didn't work. 
 Then, you know, t h
is was, anothe r  
year went by and I, of t he four , I br oke a wa y fr om
 t he other  four and I j oine d the Zi onist s.  The y  
just, there were a lot of things th
at appealed t o me, th
e fact  that, fi nall y, 
I am going to have a 
homel and, fi nally, I a m goin
g to ha ve  a passport , there was a d vent
ure .  I mme diate l y , th ey sen d me 
up i n the mountai ns and I  
had to go t h rough a  cert ain instructio
n, more t han one , on mor e tha n one  
occa sion.  And they, I adva nce d, 
I wa s prett y e ager a nd good at l
ear ni ng things , and I beca me a 
youth lea der in the move me nt and I 
love d to be with young pe ople .  And s o that , to me, was a , was a  
very happy period of my life .  My
 only conflict was with my parents.
  Since I was an only chil d, of 
course, they wanted me around as 
mu ch as possible, and I reached 
that rebellious teenage period, I  
wa s not too r ebelli ous, but rebelli ou
s e nough t o move out of t he  house
 at s i xteen a nd go t o a Zi oni s t  
childr en's home where fi rst I was ju
s t  a, a resi de nt and I like d be
i ng with my peer gr oup.  There  
wer e  ma ny, t here  were  many
 in Hungary, a  lot  of t h
e sur vivors ,  young pe ople 
of my age, just chose 
this as a life style.  And 
what we  were  doi ng t her e, we
 received a lot  of
 instructions in agriculture, in  
the l angua ge , He bre w l a nguage, in 
J e wi sh hist or y, t o pre pare  us  wh
en we go to Israel.  And my  
pare nts , of c ours e, di dn't like for me  being a wa y 
at  sixt een and I felt r eall y
 s orry for  the m and onc e  
the re belli ous peri od e nded, i n about a hal f a year 
or so, I moved ba ck home
 and one of the rea
sons  
wa s that li fe  was t oo fr e e  on t hese , i t  was t he pe
rfect kind of thesis, anti-th
esi s, that we wer e so 
restricted, now everything was free
, I mean, and I was a little bit of 
a, I was a strange kid because I 
didn't grow up ver y quic kly t o beco
me a ma n, a nd I did not like t he fa ct
 that here were girl s of my 
age who wanted t o sleep with me an
d all this and that, I just, I always
 pictured mysel f more of a, an 
indi vidual , a man who has things to
 do and I don't, I 'm not going to 
spend a lot of time with, with  
sex a nd all t his a nd my mi nd wa s not
 only on just wo men, let's put it 
t his way, eve n t
hough I already 
had sexual experience
s and the whole, and becaus
e of this, they consider
ed me a little bit of a n  
eccentric so that happy, I moved b
ack home to satisfy 
my parents, but I didn't  stay there long 
enough bec a use I got a n offer at the a ge of sevent een to go and be a reside nt advi sor in a home for  
Je wish or pha ns.  That  wa
s on, it was called Tarogato

found a ma n who bec a m e a very good
 frie nd of mi ne, the  man who l e
d the instituti
on, a ma rvelous 
ma n, also a Zionist, by
 the name of Spitzer

 and hi s fa mily, and they wer e 
very good to 
me and I felt  
very muc h at  home , pl us I  got a ni

girl frie nd who was als o  a reside nt c ounsel or the r e, 
so happy, really, they 
were very happy days. 
And in t he meanti me, 
I also partici p ated very act ively i n, I 
changed orga ni zations a nd l eft , I was in  
a, I would say, ki
nd of a petit bourgeois 
Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that  
suited my philosophy a lot more an
d I stayed with them and eventu
ally they were the ones that 
helped me t o  then i m mi gr ate t o I sr
ael , that was after, but  
we'll get to this.  Now 
I want to talk just a 
little bit a bout school be cause all the se ti mes I went to school , too.  Ri ght aft er the , 1945, as soon as 
the school started, my mother wa
s determined that I should go to 
the School of Commerce, the high 
schools wer e spe cializ e d, a nd t her e wa s one th
at was called, t he Special High School for  
Comme r ce .  Can you st op it for a s
econd because I want to close th
e window.  So as I said, my 
mother was determined th
at I should go there, of
 course, I had no desire 
but I was still a good boy 
and I started at that school and t he fact  that  it 
was t he mi ddl e of  the year, 
ba sicall y, and I  misse d t he  
fir st hal f of a year wasn't a bi
g problem because anybod
y who wa s a , a Holoc aust  s ur vivor at  t hat 
ti me c an just  about do anythi ng.  So t his was nobig proble m, t he big probl e m ca me when I notic ed 

how many of my teachers are ou
tright anti-American, 
anti-Russian, anti-Sem
itic, they haven't 
changed their attitude and there were some 
other Jewish kids in that sc
hool and I got 
together with 
the m and I a ske d the m i f , if we s h
ould tolerate this, if
 the y thi nk thi s is cor r ect and ever ybody wa s  
kind of lyi ng low, the usual wa y, a nd I  said, ﬁ N o, I 
a m not going to do t hat.ﬂ   There was speci ficall y 
one  teac her  who had, I  forgot, ha d a  Ger ma n na me
, a  ve ry s m all ma n who not onl y wa s  anti- Se mit i c 
and anti- Rus sian a nd anti -ever ythi ng and ver y pr o-
Ger ma n , but agitati ng.  He wa s not j ust ma king 
statements, he wa s really
 agitating and in a very 
e motional wa y and I was ,  
I just , I reached a point  
where I j ust coul dn't ta ke  it anym
ore , not a f ter what ha ppe ne d, just
, you know, i n the  la st fe w year s  
and my boy scout commande
r, and at that time  I was still ki
nd of hanging on w
ith the boy scout  
move me nt , my boy sc out comma n de
r was now a me mb er of the ne

he was a n offic er and he esca ped fr om t he la bor c a

ca me bac k wit h the Rus sian troops
 already and wa s one of the orga

and I said, ﬁ Thi s ma n shoul d be r e

e y did t ake hi m in a nd some how 
they went down the list 
at  school  and found out 
that I was the one who re

Q:  Okay, t his  is  tape  one, si de B 
of an interview w
ith Ro bert Holczer. 
 

A:  I just ha d to quit .  And t hen 
I  conti n ued my st udies, I  di d not wa
nt t o have the sa me experience 
agai n and I we nt to the Je wish, the Je wish ra bbi  
school, re al ly, what it wa
s, it was a school to 
educate future teachers, 
but it was a high school still.  Just
 like my previous
 high school was 
speci alized for commerci
al jobs, 
thi s one wa s, ba sicall y, a tea chi
ng gymnasium, a teaching high 
school , whic h me ant by t he l aws of
 Hungary at  that ti me t hat  on
ce you finis hedŠa nd i t  wa s instea d 
of four, fi ve  classe s, so you we
re ninet een when you fi nis hed
 t he s chool Šyou were the n a n  
element ary school t eacher at t he ag
e of nineteen without any college 
education.  I wa
s there at this 
school a nd, of course , as  far a s any kind of a ba
d experience, I  didn't ha ve any.  Now I wa s a mong  
my  own people, there we re some ve
ry, very good friends, I liked th
e school, it was nothing special, 
it wa s not c halle ngi ng me , the onl y aspe ct most  of 
us didn't like is the relig
ious a spect, whi ch we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

didn't take very seriously.  So 
actually, I was still in that school
 in my eighteen
th year when 
eve ntuall y, and we wi ll  go bac k to this, I e mi gra
te d, e migrated t o Isr a el, a nd s o I  never reall y  
fi nis hed my high school .  But out 
of deference to what ha
ppened and all this, I got a di ploma .  So I  
had a high s chool di ploma which, of c our se, my
 parents got later because
 I needed one and– so 
these are the two schools.  Once I re
ached t his level of the, thi s, th
e Jewi sh t eachi ng high school for, 
high school  for future teachers, 
whatever , it 's very di fficul t to translat e into Engli sh, perhaps  
Lyceum i s a good name for it, once 
I r eached t hat , then as
 far as my e
xperi ences aft er the Hol ocaust ,  
there was no probl e m, you know, it 's
 obvious.  Now, goi ng ba c k, of c
ourse in the me
antime, in the 
Zionist movement, a lot of change
s t ook place because we
 ha d t o go pra ct i cally
 unde r ground.  As 
the communist regi me established 
its elf in Hunga ry and i n 1948 t he 
fa mo us turn, Yea r  of the Tur n 
ca me about , whi ch happene d in ever y Ea stern Europe
an country, and the Year
 of the Turn is an 
expression when the comm
unists took control, complete 
power, because until 1948, we had 
de mocrac y i n Easter n Europe , t
hos e c ountries that  kne w what de
mocrac y wa s.  And Hungary ha d 
some very able politicians an
d was really on its road to
 become a demo
cracy, so was 
Cze chosl ova kia, and pr obabl y Pola nd, t oo, of c o ur
se , Roma nia wa s very di ff
erent.  But,
 in 1948, 
ever ythi ng has c ha nge d, we  be ca me
, agai n, jus t  li ke wi
t h t he  i llegal  boy sc out  gr oup be fore 1945, I  
found myself belongi
ng to an illegal organizatio
n, Zionism was outlawed b
ecause all of a sudden 
Stalin and company found Zi onism, of
 course , a  tool of the i mperiali s
ts as t hey call e
d it .  So we  
wer e doi ng, basic ally, the  sa me thin
gs  that we wer e doing be fore, bu
t now very c auti ously, ill egall y ,  
and mee tings were held usually ei
ther in so me far away synagogu es
, bas e me nts or i n some Je wi sh 
orphanage s where it was  not ver y obvious i f, let 's  
say, t we nty, thirty pe opl e ca me in and out beca us e  

there were hundre ds of peopl e livi ng the r e anyw
ay.  The ,  many ti me s we pa rade d as young 
communists, if we  want ed to have a larger me
et ing somewhere, singi
ng communist  s ongs whe n  
some body c a me by, but  othe rwise do
ing our own busi ness .  By 19
49, e arly 1949, t he sit uati on 
al most was intoler abl e and, basica
lly, they wanted to ha
ve the whole Zioni st movement  leave, no t  
the communists, but the Zi
onist  move ment want e d to ge t as  ma
ny pe opl e  out  as  possi ble, feari ng 
that if Czechoslovakia is
 going to turn also co mpletely communi
st, that there will be no way fr o m 
Hungary to go anywhere.  By that
 time we could only go 
illegally across th
e border.  And I think it 
was in February, 1949, that
 I got an order fro
m my Zionist le
adership to go to 
a little northern town,  
Vac z ,  V- A- C- Z,  my  mot h er co me s fr o m t h at to wn a n
d they knew it.  My j
ob was to go to the mayor 
of the town and as k hi m if
 he woul d l i ke t o ha ve a  high sc hool
 orchestra gi ve a, an eveni ng concert  
on some given date.  I went ther e, I mentioned to the mayor that
 I had been to
 Vacz many, many 
ti m
e s because my gr andparents, cousins, aunts, I  
had a lot of relatives a
nd my mother wa s born 
here , and of cour se, he was over wh
el me d that a hi gh s chool or chest r a is c o mi ng t o pla y .  I the n went  
to a printer, this was one of my 
instructions, and had all kinds of po
ster s pr inted adverti sing t he date  
and the concert.  Went 
back, re por te d it  and t he next  c o mma
nd was t hat  on a c ertai n day, I  would 
have to go with an instru
me nt or with an instrume
nt case to a corner  of Bu
dapest and the re woul d be  
a bus there, a state bus,
 by t hat ti me ever y bus 
c o mpany was  nationali zed, and I ha ve t o board the  
bus with a l ot of other people and I  have to pr
etend that I am a member
 of a hi gh s chool ba nd, 
whatever instrument I am pl ayi ng, and do, not to 
talk about anyt hing, Zi oni
s m or Isr ael, anyt hing  
like that.  And just wait for 
furt her i nstructions t here .  And of c
our se, I was noti fie d 
that this is it, 
that we would be goi ng to Isra el a nd I bi d far e
we ll to my  fa mil y an d  got an i nst ru ment case ,  
boar de d the bus on a cert ain dat e and ti me a nd I 
saw all my fe llow Zionis
t me mb er s, th e one s w ho  
wer e i n my group, and we  start ed 
toward t he Czecho
slovakian border. 
 

Q:  Ca n I  as k a few questi ons  be fore  we go on?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  I wanted to, I'm intere st ed in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism 
appealed to you as far as the t
ype of Zionist orga nizati on t hat  yo
u were i n vol ved i n a n d he aring a  
little bit more about how you fe
lt about the politics of the tim
e and the communi
st takeover. 
 

A:  I ha d very a mbival ent  fe elings li ke a  lot of 
those Jews who did not co
me  fr om t he upper mi ddl e  
class or upper class.  I came fr om defi nitel y no be
tter than the mi ddle of the 
middle cl ass or rat her ,  
perhaps, the lower middl e class. 
 My fat her came  from a very lo
w class proletari an famil y which 
wa s very unusual among the Jews  of
 Hu ngary.  My mother came  fr
om a little petit bo
urgeois fa mi ly 
fr om the northern Hungarian tow
n.  The y thought they were mi ddle clas s , but it de pe nds on how  
you classify this, as far 
as I'm concerned they were
 kind of a pseudo-petit b
ourgeois people, the kin d  
who, it 's ver y di fficult t o de fine
 them, but ther e was no
t much work and a l ot 
of complaining.  Now, 
beca use I ne ver ha d a ve ry, let 's sa y satis fa ctor y a
nd weal thy life, nat urall y I had s o me sympathie s  
wit h, with t h e Marxi st move me nt , it 's  obvi ous.  S
econd, I had a very de finite sympathy with t he m 

because they we re the most adamant about taking 
the war cri mi nals and puni
sh them.  They were 
the most anti-fascist and all these 
t hings a ppe ale d t o me.  I was ,  
you ca n c onsider eve n t h ough I wa s 
not a  me mber, re ally a ft e r my one 
mont h experi e nce , I was not a me mb
er , at le ast I di dn't consi der  
my sel f a me mb er o f t he Co mmu n i st 
Part y, but I c ertainl y was sympathi
zing with a lot of their goals, 
even though I was in a completely 
di fferent  ga me  by that ti me , knowi
ng I woul d go t o I s rael.  But , 
this is probably wh
y I changed my  affiliation and we nt fr om
 a bourge oisi e Zionist  or ga nizati on to a 
Marxist Zionist organization where 
I felt very much at 
home .  And t h ere were , of course , ugl y 
things happening, t he communi st take
over in East ern Eur ope was not 
a very pleasant occasi on.  An d 
one only had to th
ink a little bit clearly and rise above all th
is emotion to see th
at the communists 
use d very na sty me thods  to eli m
i nat e anyone who disagreed wi th 
them.  And the more power they  
grabbe d, t he  more vicious they b
eca me .  And of cour se, eve ntuall y
 I , the Zi onist s suffere d mor e  
what anybody who wa s  c
onsi dere d a Zionist or  anybody, li ke
 my fathe r , who coul d have bee n  
executed i f they di scovered t hat
 he wa s with Ti to, so
 i f you were  an e ne m
y for one reason or  
anot her , the r e wa s no la w.  The 
communists created their own laws
, t he secret police had fr ee hand 
and, of c our se, I be ga n to bec o me very dis appoi nted i n that .  My fat her , he wa s al ways a Soci al  

De mocrat , a nd he never , never approved wha t  the 
Communist Part y was doi
ng i n Hunga ry.  And he  
was very courageous because when
 the Communist Party gobbled up 
the Social De mocrati c Part y, 
he s ent  in a  postcar d a n d sai d, ﬁ Excuse  me, but 
I don't want to join 
you.ﬂ  Whic h was  ver y  
cour age ous beca use from t here on, you could have 
bee n wa tche d.  The fa ct
 tha t  he comes from a 
working class an
d was a very little fish, I thin
k saved his life.  But if he
 had been a na
me, probabl y  
he would have been 
killed then.  And so, politics, 
yes, I kept my eye on poli
tics all the time and thi s
 
helped me in 1949 to ju
st go, because I fi gured 
there will never be peace 
here, there will never be 
peac e here .  And, do you 
have any other questions? 
 

Q:  M mm- h m m.  

 

A:  Ok ay .

Q:  As far as , you ha d mentioned t hat t her e we re s o me
 serious a nti- Se miti c inci dent s at your  school a nd  
I a m wonde r ing i f you had a ny e xpectations a f t er 
the war was over that so
me of t hat would be  
ameliorated and that an
ti-Semitism was no
t goi ng t o be as muc h  
of a proble m any more?  
 
A:  Ye s, I wa s v e ry nai ve , really, at
 the age of fi fteen, fo
r some reason, I thought that a better world is 
coming.  And I was deeply disa
ppoi nted whe n I hear d t hat t h
ere were even  pogroms  in the 
countryside where a few Jews dar ed 
to come back to a vill age or a town i n Hungar y, i n Poland, i n  
Slovakia, I think the Czechs were 
the  onl y ones  who a cted i n a very
 civi lized way, 
but then they 
were always civilized and the most
 civilized in Eastern 
Europe.  That disappoi
nted me, people were 
killed, survived Auschwitz, ca me
 home and killed in 
a pogrom in Hungary 
and in some other  
Eastern European countries
, two years after the war.  And that 
made me very bitte
r and my idealism 
and my naivete rea
lly e v apor ated.  
 

Q:  Did you experience 
anything directly, any 
anti-Semitic incidents? 
 

A:  I ha ve not  been dire ctly in 
an anti-Semitic inciden
ce bec aus e I avoide d, I 
avoi de d the m, I avoide d  
any kind of such thing. 
 I associated mai nly wit h my own kind
 bec ause I s aw t hat t here  is no hope.  
Now, t his i n teresti ngl y must ha
ve change d to a certain extent 
because al most ever y one of my 
cousins is married to a gentile 
in Hungary, I think with the exce
ption of maybe tw
o, but every one 
of them, and the marriagesare very solid.  So I, a
nd it's not, they ar
e still not what 
you would call a 
truly middle class family, that mo
st of them still stayed
 in, you know, auto me
chanics and this an d 
that, t hat par t .  Now, t he one s w
ho ar e up t here , went to colle ge a
nd bec a m e dentists and those , the y  
are all marri ed to ot her Jews.  
It 's a  very inte res ting phe no menon.  But I  have not e xperi enc ed 
anything except when, right after 
the war at school.  Ok
ay?  I heard people co
nstantly yelling anti-
Semiti c sl ogans, especial ly at  socc
er ga mes , but  I  kne w that I  c an't  e
xpe ct a nyt hing el se  any mor e.   
 
Q:  And you, when you j oin
ed t he Zioni st or ganizati on, di d you ha
ve, did you reall y have dre a ms o f  
being i n I sra el, or t hat  thi s, t hat  thi s was 
something that you felt
 ver y strongl y a bout?  
 
A:  Ye s, I had drea ms a nd t h at was pr oba bly a , a , 
just  a marvel ous high of 
my youth.  Th
e whole, the 
Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spir
it  of young peopl e and re ally gi ving us what we  
wa nte d to have .  We ha d a rela tivel y free li fe, we 
had, we had a pict ur e of 
a heroic future for us, 
whether we are going to be still servi
ng in the army in Israel or just 
working in a kibb
utz as farmers, 
al most e verything about i t  had a kind of a super 
human touch that I'm going to be better than all 

these pe opl e  around her e  who ar e r
unning around like ants on the c
iti es of Buda pest , I 'm goi ng t o 
lead a very healt hy li fe, and fi
nally I '
m goi ng t o have  a c o untr
y, I have a home , I  will  have  a  
fatherland and it was, it 
wa s a mar ve l ous feeli ng.  And als o, t h
e whole, the whol
e set u p, t he whole 
orga niza tion, you know, until then, until 1946 or  so, 
most of  the pictur e that we sa w of Je wi sh 
people is, is like sheep going in
t o Auschwitz .  And all of a sudde
n these peopl e come fr om Israel ,  
they are bea uti ful looki ng people .  And not onl y 
that, t hey had courage, the way t hey car ried  
themse lves and they were teaching 
us a lot  of thi ngs, you 
know, Israel sent a lo
t of, they called them 
Schli ahs
, people that, those who are sent
, I think, literally.  And they 
were in charge
 of all these 
camps wher e we had to go t o wher e 
we wer e ta u ght s el f-d e fe nse a n
d, you know, we li ved on a tree  
in one camp, I think what , for fort
y- ei ght hours, we we re gi ve n a pi
ec e of r ope a nd 
a knife and we 
had to sta y up, a nd sle e p up ther e a nd make ou
r be d and al l thi s.  I  me
an, whi ch young per son  
doe sn't li ke this?   The whole  i m
age of t he Jew has ch
ange d in our mi nd and 
we said, ﬁGod, it's

beautiful.ﬂ  And when we were in danger, they were
 the ones wh o led us out 
of danger.  I reme mb er 
onc e I wa s up in the Börzs öny mo
untai ns in Hungary i n a sel f-d
efense camp for  a week an d 
somebody betrayed us to the poli
ce a nd the police  surrounde d us an
d there was a cr
ee k, not deeper,  
I don't thi nk it was dee pe r  than 
ma ybe twe nty i nc hes , and gue ss w
ho is t h e one who e scaped fr om 
the creek in order to do somethin
g, not to sa ve hi s own s kin, but
 he was i m me diat ely telephonin g 
and all  thi s and that and event ua
lly  we  were  rel ease d.  
 The Israeli  what ever, di plo mat, I  can't  call  
the m, the di plomat is not the right word be cause
 you picture some body, y
ou know, wi th a tie and 
suit and all this, but they 
wer e just, I, me sse ngers or
 whatever, leaders.  And 
he escaped, he escaped 
in that creek, crawling in twenty
 inch of water, you 
know, gett ing on s o me thing tha t  bl end i n with  
the, with the rocks, I 
me an t hey were  unbelie va bl e, unbelie
va ble people .  And women, you know, 
it 's, it 's , oka y, a fte r the m  the wome n ca me and, I me
an this is a completely 
different Jew.  I mean,  
and whe n I t ook my wi fe  to Isr
ael, she under stood that , that ther
e was just  somet h
ing a bout those  
kids .  And s o this , this , of course
, was, they wer e  idols a nd i t  wa
s very easy to follow the m.  An d 
they were, t hey were not real
l y de ma gogues, I  re me mbe r  quite
 a fe w of them who got quite  
introverte d, they were not gi ving you bi g s peec he
s or s o me thing, but by per sonal e xa mpl e, t he y 
wer e leaders because we foll owed
 them.  So the, the bus goi ng ba
ck to my escape fr om Hungary, 
the bus eventually r eached Vacz and, needless to
 say, it didn't stop there. 
 Beyond Vacz, it became  
quite  dar k a n d our le ade r  suggest ed to the bus  dri v
er that we stop somewh
er e and eat and there was 
a roadside pub where they also se
r v ed food.  We we nt 
in a n d we wer e  g i ve
n mone y and we c oul d 
order s o met hing, and in that pub, t he r e was a ver y
 beautiful peasant woman, 
with I don't know how 
many skirts on her, this was the 
reason you recogni
ze a peasant woman, in thos
e days they still wore 
a lot of skirts, you know, 
that 's an East ern European cost ume t h at
 a  doze n s k irts is  no big deal .  And  
she started to flirt with the bus driver.  And soon 
the bus  dri v er ca me , we nt over t o he r table , a nd 
they had a good ti me and, 
of course , we were ge tting more a nd 
more anxious t hat t his is goi ng t o  
create a big problem her e, right?  
We kne w t hat we wer e  on a ti me ta
bl e.  All of a s udden, the bus  
drive r sai d t o our lea der , ﬁHow long do you thi nk we 
will  be here? ﬂ  And our lea der sai d, ﬁ Well, all  
these  ki ds  ea t, oh, a  hal f an hour, 
fort y- five mi nut es.ﬂ   He s aid, ﬁ G oo
d, I 'll  be bac k.ﬂ a n d le ft  wit h  
the woman.  We ate, and 
our le ader sa id, ﬁ O kay, li ne up outsi d
e.ﬂ  And inst ead of 
going back t o the 
bus , he le d us down on a  fie l d i nto
 a big ba rn, I would sa
y about one  mile down 
i n a mu ddy fiel d, it  
wa s Fe brua r y and s now and mud ev
erywhere.  We all got i nto the 
barn, about thirty of us, the y 
closed the doors, barn doors, an
d he said, ﬁOkay, don'
t worry.  Everyt
hing will be okay.ﬂ  After 
mi dni ght , 1: 00 or so, t h e ba rn door
 ope ne
d a nd we  were , t h ey said
 we have t o get on l ine  and 
mar che d down, t her e wa s the ri ver 
Ipoly, I-P- O- L-Y, and that wa
s the border between Hu ngary and 
Czechoslovakia.  The Austrian bor
der was already sealed, but the 
Czechs still let Zionist groups 
come over , i t  was kind of a n arra nge me nt, t he J oi n
t did it for a lot of mone
y, howe ver ,  they di dn't 
know which border, Cze ch border gu
ard was a c o mmunist or  not, s o we have to be very care ful . 
And once we went beyond the border 
guards, everything was or
ganized there, I will 
go back to this. 
So a s we we re marchi ng down, I sa
w a woman i n a leather jacket w
ith a re vol ver ha ngi ng on her hi p 
in bl ue j eans.  I l ooked at  this
 woma n's face , s aid, ﬁHe y
, I have  see n he r be f ore
.ﬂ  An d I looked and 
said, ﬁThis is the woman in the pu
b.ﬂ   This  is to s how you how or gani zed the y wer e.  I mea n, the  
Ger ma ns  couldn't ha ve done better , really, with t heir devil ish orga
niz ation.  I  mea n, e veryt hing, i f  
you under stood t he wh
ole, they called it 
aliyah
, the  goi ng of, t o Israel .  I f
 you under stood that, ho w  
they did it, you c an under stand how 
they c oul d sur vive .  
All right?  Surrounded
 by, of c ours e, a sea 
of enemies.  On ce we  got do
wn t o the river , we ha d 
to ta ke  our s hoe s off, and we  kept eve rythi ng on 
our hea d, t he  river wa s not high e n
ough, we couldn't s wi m, s o we ha d 
to wal k, but I was very s mall , 
and it got to my throat at one tim
e.  Now this is February, imagine.
  We got over to the other side

and it was suppose d to be  that the bor der guards 
c hange , ever ything was ac cordi ng t o the cloc k, a nd  
somet hing happene d and the bor der guar ds di d not 
cha nge the wa y the y wer e suppos ed to, t hey 
were still talking to each other.  There was snow on the ground and th
e dogs, their dogs were  
barki ng, so we  ha d t o lie  down on 
t he  snow for a b out a hal f a n  hour, 
wet.  An d ma ny of us got sick, 
right there.  I myself, I lost, I got
 frostbitten and even to
day I suffer for that. 
 Now, then the border  
guar ds  finall y wer e gone and we went  up, t her e wa s 
a house where t hey used 
to press grapes, it was  
a gra pe growing re gion, but had no 
r oof a nd the wind wa s bl owi ng 
and I remember, 
I don't t hink I  
have ever been colder i n my li
fe  si nc e the n.  And so we huddle
d t ogether  because now we missed 
the truck that was supposed to pick us up right do
wn on a highway beyond that
 hill, so the Israelis, 
the t w o I srae lis, a ma n a n d a  woma

the y we nt down and 
eventually, in about  
four or five hours, t he y l ocate d

Tape 6, Si de  A 
 

Q:  Thi s is tape two, si de A, of
 an i nter v iew wit h Robert Hol czer . 
 So you'll say so methi n g about t he 
group of people th
at you were with. 
 

A:  I, my best fri end i n that group 
was a young ma n by the na me
 of Zev Rotics.  He li
ves in Israel at this 
time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Sh
unamit 14, and we corres
pond monthly, we have
 been ever since, 
ever since t h at ti me, and 
eventuall y when I left  Isr ael, we corre
sponded, we  kept 
up and I consider  
hi m my be st  frie nd.  He 's about 
the onl y pers on I keep up wi th.  Oh
 no, t here was one, another, a  
ma n by t he na me of Ni ssa n Me schel, a nd I ha ve no, 
he is in touch with my 
friend, Zev Rotics, but I  
lost touch with hi m, s o I  have no ide a what ha pp
ene d, I just know t hat he 's livi ng t he r e.  But the  
other s, t he, I  re me mber one youn
g l a dy who wa s wit h us and she ,
 unfor tunat ely, ha d eve ntually  
pne u mo nia wh en we g o t  to Vie nna ,  whic h I wi ll 
go bac k to when I c onti nue t he story of the  
jour ney, and died in Vie nna of pne u monia , and 
she's buri ed t here somewher
e in the cemetery and I 
always pla n ned t o go a nd visit her, but I a l ways
 run out of ti me and I 
don't know where she i s  
burie d, pr obably there is  
no more than one Je wi sh cemetery, so 
when I  go back t o Isr ael I ' m goi ng 
to find out because my wi
fe– Zev Rotics, someti mes 
he goes to the meeti n gs
 of our ol d fri ends and  
so he woul d know.  Now, a f
ter t he t r uck fi nall y st oppe d i n Brati sla
va .  In Br atisla va t hey took us t o  
the gendar merie where, as a for ma
lit y , we we re ar reste
d, and i nterned in t h e 
syna gogue , they t oo k  
us t o t he s yna gogue that ha d 
alrea dy war
m r ooms, stra w on t h
e floor , bl ankets , good food, 
ever ythi ng, a nd we  were  told t hat
 ne xt morning we are 
goi ng on.  And it  wa s 
very str ange beca us e 
next mor ning, a gai n, t he  gendar me ri e surr ounde d 
the  syna gogue , it wa s a  bi

just i n c ase  some  Sovi et  aut hor
it y i s wat c hi ng.  And t he y t o ok us
 to t he  railroa d stati on where  we 
wer e taken i n boxcar s, how i nter esti ng, l oc ked 
up, quite a fe w people in boxcars , and the tra in 
starte d and I think wit hi n an hour
 or  so, they opene d up a nd we were in the Ame ric an sect or of  
Vie nna.  Be caus e  Bra tisl a va is ver y c l ose to Vie n na
.  We sta y ed in Vi enna  for , I think, two, one or 
two weeks, and in an Am
erican hospital, that's 
where the Joint somehow go
t an American hospital 
for t he Zioni st members and we we

re  gi ven good food a nd war m rooms  a nd it

wa s ver y ple asant , the only thing we wer e al ways  wa
rned about, not to ever 
wander into the Soviet 
section.  We  were free t o wander 
ar ound, the c it y was  stil l divide
d i nto four  sect ions, Ame rica n,  
Briti sh, French a nd Sovi et
.  And someti mes we  had to go ve ry 
cl ose t o t he Soviet section in goi ng 
to, I re me mb er goi ng t o a  swi m mi ng 
pool, it was on the edge
, and s o everybody wa
s ne rvous.  But ,  
basic ally, it wa s a good t i me .  Vi enna
 was full of refugees, ful l  of li
fe.  Aft er one wee k or so, the n 
we wer e taken acr os s, a gain by tr uc ks, across t h e Al
ps i nto, no I have to correc t  mys elf, to, not t o  
Au stria, to a, a, a UNRRA 
camp, UNRRA was the United Nati
ons Refugee Associ ation or 
somet hing, s o the joi nt gave us te mp oraril y ove r to
 UNRRA a nd we were house d in a bea uti ful ar e a 
of the Al ps in a town called Za al felden.  It  is 
a , on a l ake , j u st the othe
r side  from G er many, and 
there wer e some very pi cturesque vil lages near
by, and I re me mber e ven 
t hough her e  the food wa s  
very meager  and we stil
l were hiki ng al most every day a nd 
goi ng up i n the 
mountains, and I 
remember that just  abov
e our  ca mp, our r e fugee  ca mp, there  
was a place, a m
ountain hut where  
Hitler and Mussolini met and we ha
d to see it and someti
mes a cabbage soup a 
day just didn't give 
us enough energy, but we were still 
pushing for it, we want
ed to see it.  We  st
ayed here, again, one  
or t wo wee k s and t he n on, agai n, now
 over t he border  to Ital y.  In 
Ital y, t hey took 
us agai n t o the 
train st ation, somewhere 
in nor ther n I t aly, and t he  train then wa
s closed up and s eale d, but re gul ar  
train, we j ust  could not  le
ave t he train, Italian detectives were on
 the trai n t o  make  s ure t hat nobody  
esca pes  be ca use  it wa s ri dicul ous bec ause  who wants  to
 escape to Ital y, at  l
east at t hat  t i me?  And 
we were taken down to Bari.  Now, 
the only thing that stands out in my mi nd wa s that a lot of time s 
wh en the train stopped, we , of 
course, rolled the windows down 
and the good looking girls among 
us e nde d up wit h doze ns of pi cture s fr om Itali a n 
men, written on it, I love 
you, I 'm goin
g to marry  
you and all this, by the 
ti me  we got  to Bari , I t hink the gir l
s were exc h angi ng pict ures a nd who 
wa nte d this one a nd t his  one?   I me a n it wa s a fu
nny t hing to see that t hose men were  really jus t  
instantly falling in love 
wit h these girls.  In Bari , a shi p wa
s  wai ting for us, i f you could call it  a  
ship.  It was called the Galil, Galil
ea or Galilee, I forgot 
exactly, and so we board
ed the ship and in  
two da ys  or three da ys , it  must ha ve been t hree  
I t hin k, we  we re 
going to reach Ha
ifa.  Everybody 
got sea sick, the boat was an ol d,
 ol d fishi ng boat  that  the Isr a e
li government brought from,  bought  
fr om Greec e  and it was a pri mitive thi ng, ver y pri miti
ve .  And I know I ha ve a ver y str ong will a nd I 
don't  want  t o, you know, go ba ck 
to that, to t he s tory, but  I neve
r  thr o w up, some how I jus t  psych 
myself up ever since I was a little
 kid as a result of an incident 
that I would not 
throw up.  And I 
re me mb er I  w a s t he on ly 
one on t he ship who c
ould eat. Ev erybody else was just constantl y  
throwi ng up and so we arrive d, by t he ti me we a
rrived in Haifa, ever yb
ody was j
ust  yellow and 
gree n a nd woul dn™t  want  to l ook at
 food.  Now, t he funny thi ng about
 this ship is 
t hat  a fe w years  
ago I was travelling in France with
 my wi fe and we stopped in th
e Loire valley in a small little 
town, Bl ois, and as we were wa lk
ing in the town there was a kind of
 a summer suit that I wanted to 
buy, it wa s very inexpens ive a nd I 
needed a summer suit for wearing 
on some occasion that I have  
to wear a suit and I went
 into the shop and I was tr
ying on the suit when the 
owner  of the  shop all of 
a sudden yel led and said, ﬁShal o m 
haver.ﬂ  And it  appear
s he wa s tal king t o 
my  wi fe  a nd so me h o w  
it ca me that he was a Moroc can Je w and he wa s 
telling, I thi nk, my wi fe  that he was a Moroccan  
Je w and a ll this, beca use he ha d a de finite Arabic 
na me .  And so my wi fe , I think, tol d hi m t hat I  
wa s Je wi sh, too you know, and th
is, so he invited us after th
e deal Šwhi ch was  a good one Šh e  
invite d us t o a bar  down on the str
eet, an out door c afé, t o drink some
thing with him. 
 And during the 
conversation he asked me  a little bit 
about my life a
nd he said to, and I aske
d him and he 
said, ﬁOh, 
I was in Israel, I wa
s a s ailor.ﬂ  I sai d, ﬁ Wher e did you s ail?
ﬂ  He said, I n the Medit erranean, of  
cour se,ﬂ and I said, ﬁ What ship? ﬂ  He said, ﬁ The Galil ea.ﬂ  ﬁWhat ti me? ﬂ   He said, ﬁ F rom 1948 to 

1950 some thing.ﬂ  Well , he wa s on
 that s hip, you know, 
and I mean it wa
s a small ship and he wa s

one of the sa ilors .  Well, when we ar r i ved i n Hai f
a, of c our se , that was a 
very emotional scene and 
then eventually, the war, basica
lly, wa s fi nis he d and ther e was no 
te mpor ar y ani mosit y so then we , 
our move me nt we nt to a ki
bbutz t her e where we t hen
 blende d in and one year
 a fter we wer e tau ght  
a trade in the kibbutz and we got 
our own land then.  I don't know
 what  else you want t o know  
about the Israeli thing. 
 
Q:  Eve r yone  from your  gr oup t h
en who wa s tra velli ng t oget her
 went t o t he  sa me  ki bbutz?  
 

A:  Ye s, ever yo ne we nt t o t he s a me
 kibbutz  except  t he one s who did no
t want to go t o t he  kibbut z, ha d 
relatives who were waiting fo r them
 and this was a little bit of a 
disappointment 
to us because  
theor eticall y, ever ybody was supposed
 to stay together , but this wa
s not the case.  
There were, not  
ever ybody wa nts to live in a kib
butz because it  is a very di ffi c
ult living for those who dream of 
mone y and wea lth and 
t heir own car  and all t his 
because it 's a, at  that  
time it was a very perfect  
communit y, but it was a communit y, 
you didn't ha ve a grea t de al that you owned at all , you  know, 

you were l uc ky i f you ha d a ra dio t h
a t  you can cal l your own.  So 
we l ost , I  would say, about one-
third of our group who had pl anne d, 
but not share d the ir pl an wit h us
, t o go i m me diatel y and st ay o n  
the outside. 
 

Q:  How wa s it deci ded t hat your gr
oup would go to a kibb
utz , was it deci ded communall y a mong the  
group or  di d some one  el s e
 decide it fo r you? 
 

A: AllZionistyouth
 organizations basi
cally, with very little exceptio
n, very few exce
ptions, were 
geared toward the ki bbutz.  Thi s was an unde
r st a ndi ng bac k  in East ern Eur ope whe r e we wer e  
recruit ed t hat Israel , and they al ways brought th
e example of the pyrami d, 
t hat the, we Jews, w e  
always li ke a pyra mi d on the top, we had all t he ,
 the far me r s , and down 
at the bottom where the  
pyramid is the largest, we had a
ll the intellectuals, and Israel n
eede d a pyra mi d ups ide down, wher e  
the lar ge st gr oup is goi ng 
to be the far mer s and t he agricult ural 
group, a nd t he s ma
llest one is goin g 
to be the intellectuals, the tip of
 t he pyra mi d.  So al most e ve ry Zi
onist or gani zation,
 that was the 
very str ong i n flue nce  a nd educati onal goal  to tea ch 
you t o go a nd be  a far m
er in a collective, you 
know?   So that was t he reason 
why most of us did go 
t o a ki bbutz.  And who decided it?   It was  
deci ded above, t hat had not hing to do with us, 
where we woul d g
o, we  wer e as signed to an old  
kibbutz , ver y ol d, e xpe r i ence d, 
lar g e ki bbutz , c alled Givat  Chaji m
, in Israel whic
h is in, about  
mi dway bet ween Hai f a and Tel Avi v 
and thi s is where we l e arned ou
r trade for one year, we stayed 
there for one ye ar. 
 

Q:  Did you s pe ak any He br ew at  all?  

 

A:  We did not s pea k any He bre w whe n we arri ve d th
ere, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except 
the ones who came from 
very reli gious fa mil i es .  They kne w 
quite  a bi t a nd for 
them it was much  
easier to le ar n, we spoke no Yiddish beca use Hung
aria ns do not spea k, Hungari an Je ws, ver y fe w 
Hungarian Jews speak Yidd
ish, and so at fi
rst 
we felt a little bit kind 
of ostracized by the 
communit y, especiall y t h e young Is
ra eli ki ds .  There wer e s o ma ny
 Hungarians comi ng
 in at that  
ti me t hat the Hungar ians even had a nickname in 
Israel, they were called 
Igen-Mi gen, I gen means 
yes in Hungarian a nd s o  kids wo
uld go a fter us on the stre et a
nd call us I gen- Migen, Igen- Migen, 
because they heard us speak
.  And s o  we wer e i n a bi g hurr y t o
 le arn  Hebr ew.  An d t he n wh en  we  
learned Hebr ew, we
 had anot her  thi n g, t he Hungarian l anguage
 is such t hat your accent stays wit h

you no ma tter what language you 
le arn, a nd so we  ha d a ve ry t h
ick accent, even when we we re 
speaking Hebrew, so we ha
d our difficulties with the 
language, but most of us
 learned it eventually. 
I was there i n Israel  for t wo y
ears  a n d by the  ti me  I c a me ho me, I  was  re all y s pea king fl uentl y. 
 
Q:  What  tra de did you le arn on this  kibbutz?  

 

A:  Okay, I was a tractor dri ver in
 the ki bbutz and worke d out pl owi ng e ver ything conne c ted wit h the  
tractor , it was called a Falha, t hat par t icular branc
h, and from sacki ng, you know, fl our s and up to 
plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, 
we did everything.  Then we got our own land, 
own piec e of land, whic h wa s a r
eclai med ar ea on the tr ain li ne bet w
een Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was  
the, the, the Israel  and 
Jordan s wa ppe d la nd a nd s o J ordan gi ve
 back a piece of land so t he tr ain 
servi ce can go from Tel  Avi v to Ha
i fa because part of the train lin
e was i n Jor dan.  This was the  
land t hat we received, and it was 
a very danger ous place, so when
 we, the first day we went out 
there, I remember, wa
s really hair raising beca
use the tract or dr ivers had t o go down a n d plow a nd  
the, t he weed in Israel is much 
higher  than a hu ma n bei ng and also
 we didn't know wher e the mi nes ,  
if ther e wer e  any mi nes.  And ev
en t hough the ar my su
pport e d us a nd the y di d give us, you know, 
generous s upport t here , we the tract or drive r s ha d 
t o go down a nd pr actic all y open up the area.  And 
so we wer e very r espect ed in t he kibbutz for t hat
 reason.  Above us was an
 Ara b town, 
Tul Ka re m,  
which today is under 
Israeli occupation and 
still a very hot spot 
for riots.  And I re
memb er that Arab 
town pra ctic ally you c ould s ee t he pe ople  on t he str
eet, and here we  were on
 the other side living, 
you know, two enemies and of course
, I  had a l ot  of adve ntur es beca
use of living onthe border, but  
then again, t hat has not much to
 do with the Holoca ust and I am 
sure that the Ho
loca ust Museum 
has a lot of testimonies from Israel
i s so the y don't  need.  I don't 
know, but that 's up to you, but  I  

have a lot of stories that ca me to us as a re sult of
 l iving so cl ose at t hat 
ti me , back in 1948, 1949, on 
the bor der , you know. 
 
Q:  I 'd be  int eres t ed i n hear ing how, what  ki nds  of 
rel ations or enc ounters  yo
u had with Arabs in that  
area. 
 
A:  We ll, wh en we fir s t sh o we d u p, wh e n we first 
s h owed up, the  firs t da y, t h ere were Ara b she pherds 
down on the  other si de of the bar bed wire , the bor d
er was just mar ke d wit h  a bunc h of barbed wire . 
And when they saw us, they emitte
d a sound like w
oo-woo-woo, and they we
re running away, they 
were just scared to deat
h.  These were she pher ds , very poor 
people, and we didn'
t know exactl y who  
they were, but we l
ear ned eventuall y, that  they
 were, they were working 
f or t he l oca l, you know, 
sheik or whomever owns the land fo
r very little.  And even
tually, we also
 saw that here
 on this side 
of the border  we are plowing with up-t o-dat e 20
th
-c entur y mac h inery a nd we  saw not fa r fr om us , a  
ma n on a horseba ck whi ppi ng people  just be cause  th ey did s o met hing a pparentl y that did not pl eas e 

the m.  The owner of the l and had pra c tically c o mpl e
te juris dicti on over the s e poor fell ows , and that  
wa s just a few hundr ed yards from 
wh ere we were wor kin g.   As t he y g ot us ed t o u s, th ey c a me  
close r  a nd cl oser  and wh
en t hey saw that we do
n't  mean a ny har m, t he y 
ca me  down t o the bar bed 
wire ma n y ti me s, wat c hi ng t o mak e
 sure t hat nobody s ees t h e m and 
tried to make friends with us 
and we di d ma ke frie nds with t he m
 for, the mai n reason is t hat 
chocolat e was very expensi ve in 
Israel t hos e days, c oc oa, and we al re ady had quit e 
a fe w chil dren i n our group, ba bie s.  Cigar ette s  

wer e very e xpe nsi ve for  
some reason in Jordan 
and t hey were very cheap
 in Israel, American 
cigare ttes .  So the y asked, oh, the se peopl e offer e
d us a deal , but they di
d not wa nt to do it during 
the day because they were afr aid that the– Jor d an
 had the best military 
force, the Arab Legion, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
54 
 
 
trained by the British and th
ey were afraid that they
 were patrolling there a
nd all this and it was a  
serious cri m e to deal wit h, with I srael is.  So at 
ni ght in the dar kne ss, a nd 
I re me mb er it wa s my tur n ,  
too , it  was  al wa ys  a fe w peo ple  
and a l wa ys  the  tra ctor dri vers  beca
use  we  had the c ont act wit h t he  
bor der pe opl e, we we nt down be cause  they would 
recogniz e us  and it wa s a  very ris ky t hing, they 
coul d ha ve j ust shot me  dea d ri
ght  there, it could have bee n a  tr
ap.  We went down a n d we  were  
doi ng all t he  busi nes s, t h ey jumped 
over or we went over , but  mai nly
 t hey came over because t hey 
wer e much better fence jumpers than
 we were .  So this wa s one  contact t hat we had.  The  other one  
was not so pleasant, these 
wadi s, dr y river  beds , t hat r un acr oss, the y don't rec ognize  bor ders , t he y  
run, you know, bac k and forth, Is
ra el, Jordan, and in, wh
en they are dry which is most of the time,  
this is where  the Ara b thi eves c o me over, they use  these river beds be cause you c an't see  the m, the y  
are, you know, they are like little canyons.  And th
ey would come over in 
these river beds and go  
into other ar eas and steal , mai nly 
ani mal s.  And t hey were unbelie va
bl y good thi eve s.  They woul d  
steal, they can, they would stea
l a cattle, they would 
steal a donkey, they 
would steal a horse 
surr ounde d by wall s.  Nobody could e ver figure out ho
w they di d it.  So the a r my hire d us  to be kind 
of a paramili tary fo
rce and go out and lie, so 
we  had to lie down in the 
wadis  and a fe w of us , we  
didn't have very good guns, we ha
d old Cz ech guns, a nd wait for the s
e thie ves to c o me .  And I only  
had one occasion when t hree of us were in a patr ol
 and there wer e about fift
een or t we nty of the se  
coming by and we didn't feel lik
e getting murdered by 
the m because what ch
ances do we have? 
And so we l et the m go by a nd t he n r eport ed to t h e 
border police that they 
we nt by, but we di dn't  
wa nt to e nga ge in a ny fi r e fi ght t her e.  Now,
 my good e xpe ri ence wa s wi th the Jor da nian Le gion, 
whi ch then eve ntuall y had also a s a d endi ng.  A
ll of a s udde n one day we were , I wa s plowing I 
re me mber, a nd I  had to ha ve al
ways a guard on my  tractor wi
th a s ubmac hine  gun who was  
constant ly c asing a nd watchi ng bec a use I was s o  cl
os e to t he  bor der a nd this wa s a fr iend of mi ne  
one  da y who was a gua rd in an 
Arab POW camp, an I s
raeli  POW camp, guardi ng Arabs duri ng th e 
Wa r of Independence, so he le
arned some Arabic fr om them. 
 And you will see why this is  
i mport a nt , a nd all of a s udden we  s a w s o me, an Ara b Legi on patr
ol ri ght by the bar be d wir e and 
they were motioning to us to co
me  down and we  said no, you know. 
 And s o they went awa y.  Ne xt  
day they ca me a nd a gai n they wer e
 motioning, t hey s aid, ﬁPe ace, peac
e.ﬂ  So fi nally they went bac k  
about fi fty yards and they 
put  thei r guns  int o a pi
le and then came back, sh
owing that they had no 
weapons and they tol d us, 
ﬁSit down on that side 
of the border.  
Wh at can we  do?ﬂ  Th ey were  
about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we 
said, ﬁOkay, let's go down.  Wh at do they want? ﬂ  
They just wanted to talk to us and from there o
n, e very day t he y woul d come
 down at a certai n ti me 
and eventually they, the Ar
a bs have wat er mel on all over, so i t  wa
s like a party, t hey would yell  a t  
one of these  poor fellows 
who wa s worki ng t her e and I , thi s  is 
all I learned in Arabic, what it is,  
ﬁHey, bri ng me a wat er mel on.ﬂ  
Yal l a Ji bbu Bat tiyah
.  And they br ought
 
a water mel on and they 
would slice it and we were eating, 
almost every day we had a little 
lunch there together, we brought 
some stuff.  And this went on 
for we eks an d wee ks a nd  wee k s an d we
eks.  And event u ally we reall y 
foole d our c ountries bec ause some ti
mes they came over and ate and la
ughed t hat t hey ate i n Isr a el  
and sometimes we 
jumpe d over a nd we said, 
ﬁOh, we ate in Jordan.ﬂ  
An d one day it wa s our turn, 
we st opped the tract or, t hey have n't come down ye
t so we were waiting 
for them, but we were 
already sitting on the ot
her side, we had 
a little blanket, we put it do
wn, all the food fr om our 
kitchen and all of a sudden
 a patrol  is there , but it is a tot al l y di ffere nt patrol .  Wha t  ha ppe ne d,  

apparently somebody sa
w t he m and repor ted the m
, I don't know what ev
er ha ppe ne d, I never s a w 
the m a gai n and the se guys wer e, 
t he y dr e w their  guns and they 
are going to shoo
t us.  And you 
know that border was no jo
ke, every night some
body was killed there, either 
an Israeli or an Arab. 
Ver y innoce nt pe opl e, y
ou know, s o meti mes a , one night I fe

were walking around and apparently
 t hey were i n t he wrong place an
d a n Isr aeli guar d, a nd most o f  
the Isr aeli border  guards wer e fr
om Arab countries, Arab Jews, we
ll , not Ara b, t hat sounds ki nd of 
strange , but Je ws from Ara b co
untri es, a nd they were vi cious.  I me an, you c ould not get better  
bor der guards and t he y wer e, the y hated the  Ara bs 
mo re tha n we hat e d t he Na zis.   An d so the y  
wer e, t he y were, the y sa w one at  ni ght, t he y wer e
 shooti ng someti mes for  no 
r eas on.  So that wa s a  
very poisonous atmo sphere there, 
and I mean it took a long time a
nd the fact that my friend spoke 
some Ara bic  and all t his and miti gate d the sit u
ati o n, but the n t he man s aid, ﬁHow c o me  you s pea k 
some Ara bic ?   Where di d you le arn it? ﬂ  And the n he 
ha d to ki nd of, s o final l y the se rge a nt who wa s 
leadi ng all t hem, al ways a master  
se rgea nt le adi ng t he  pat rol, he s aid, ﬁ You ha ve one l uc k that I  
have a  son of your age.ﬂ  
 He said, ﬁI f I ever see 
you e ven down touchi ng the 
ba rbe d wir e ,ﬂ he  sai d,  
ﬁI a m going to just ma ke  dust out 
of you.ﬂ  And of cour
se , we never went  back agai n.  That wa s,  
these ar e some exper iences li vi ng on the border. 
 
Q:  Do  y ou r e me mber what 
you would t alk a bout wi th 
these, wit h the guar ds 
before t hey were take n 
away? 
 

A: We ll, it was a very 
si mple c onvers a tion bec aus e  we  ha d a 
la nguage pr oble m, it 
was mai nly si gn 
langua ge quite a bit, and we we
r e t alking a bout , ba sical ly, t hese  pe opl e wer e tal king about t heir  
children, they showed pi ctures of 
t heir famili es and the wor d peace, 
Salaam

 in Hebrew, 
wa s c onstantly me nti one d.  And I  ha
ve  a feeli n g t hat all of us  invol ve d, probabl y, i f the y are ,  
hopefully they are alive, will always remember thisand that kind of softened 
us up, so we know that 
huma n bei n gs ca n rela x under certai n circums t a n ces 
and we don't have t o be
 enemies.  It was the 
fir st ti me t hat I r ealized that an
 Arab can, doesn't  necessarily ha
ve t o be my opp
onent , you know?  
 

Q:  How ma ny peopl e wer e  me
mber s of this ki bbutz?  
 
A:  About  a hundred, a bout a hund
red, and all from Hu ngary.  Bu
t ot her kibbutzi m ha d someti me s

End of Ta pe 6, Si de  A 
 
 
Tape 6, Si de  B 
 
Q:  Okay, this is tape  two, si de B 
of an interview with Ro
bert Ho lczer.  Did you fi
nd that your dream of 
Israel was fulfill ed, the ut opia n ide al t hat you ha
d and s o me of  your , your 
t hirst for a pl ace wher e 
you felt you belonged
, was fulfilled there? 
 

A: At first I was very, very idea
listic.  Then so
mehow, I felt a 
little bit disappointed where in our 
kibbutz , all kinds of poli tical gr ou
ps tried to kind of t ear us a part.
  And t h ere were
 mo re an d more  
arguments and so
mehow this and the fa ct that as the countr
y settled down into so-c
alled peace, if we  
can call it, the usual symptoms that
 every nation in the wor l d experi
ences, sur faced, such as cri me  
and– but the fact that t h ere were Jewish cri mi nals,
 that s hocke d me.  You know, I wa s s o nai ve tha t  
I thought  tha t anybody go
es to Israel, certai n
ly doesn't want 
t o  do a nyt hing to hur t a not her huma n 
being.  Ther e were even, even murderers, and I just
 one day a f ter anot her , these t hings, they a dde d  

to my little disappoint
ment, but I was still en
joying my self beca
use I love to be 
outdoors a
nd we, we

did t he physi cal wor k and it was all  that a young 
person wants for sel f-i ma
ge, good self-ima ge, we  
had a very good sel f-i mage of our
se lves .  There  we re t w o t hings 
t hat c ontri but ed t o my, t o my 
coming, goi ng back to 
Hungary eve ntuall y in '51.  
One was, all of a sudden I 
realized that
 I, in all 
my  li fe I l ov e d my fath er  
very, very much, a nd t his 
is a, I me an it 's a fact, there i s not hing you can  
do about it, I loved my father mo
re t han I  lo ved  my  mot her .  So
me how I always considered my  
mother a little bit of 
a, of a ki nd of pet it bourge
oi s that I  ne ver r eally comp
le tely underst o od.  And I  
thought that she was a little
 bit, s he wa s just i n a not her, i n ot
her wor ds, s he want ed me to be als o, 
you know, li ke s he  was , and pla y t he piano a nd all  
these t hings and I was not 
the  type.  So I wa s not  
that cl ose  to her e ve n though I wa
s with her all the time and practic
all y, I was also i nst rument al i n  
savi ng he r life in t he war  whe n I dragged her wit h  
me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I 
realized I spent very little time w
ith my father as a yo
ung man because 
he was always 
away in, i n  
the conce ntr ation ca mp.  And now
 he wa s ho me and now the y co
uldn't c o me any more, Hungar y  
wa s se ale d.  And the n I  also, at
 the age of ninet een, 
beca me  some how i nvolv
e d wit h a gr oup of 
cyni cal people.  And I met the m her e  and t her e 
a nd s o me of t he m I kne w 
fr om Hunga r y and t hey 
were married to this and 
this, I just somehow was 
under t he inf luence of th
e se who sa w not hing ni ce 
any more in Israel except  the ba
d things.  This, the homesickness plus
 the fact t hat t hen I began to 
get all  ki nds  of propaga nda materi al  fr om Hungary
 and somehow, this was 
the third thing, I was 
misled by all this, what I rea
d, and I thought that the situati
on cha nged and Hungar y is such a  
mar vel ous country toda y.  And 
my parents tried to communicate 
to me, even though they never 
wa nted me  to really go away, bu
t now t he y didn't want  me t o  real
l y c o me  ho me ,  the y wer e  a fr a id  
what would happe n to me
.  And that, they just 
appare ntly didn't c o me acr oss quit e we ll beca us e I ,  
eve ntuall y I just de cide d I want t o go bac k to 
Hungary, and pr oba bly home sicknes s had a great deal  
to do, I , at t hat ti me as a yo
ung ma n, I didn't re alize t hat you 
can't go home again, you know?  I 
envi sioned t hat ever ythi ng i s goi ng t o be bac k a
nd all this.  We ll, I then 
appli ed to the Hungar ian 
Emba ss y, got a per mit a n d the I sraeli s , of c our se, didn
™t ke ep me t here , a n d in 1951, I retur ned t o  
Hu ng ary .  And t ho s e we re the  wo
rst year s, aside fr om October 15
th, thos e ye ars wer e  the worst  
years of my  life , the ne
xt  t wo or t hree  years .  
 
Q:  Before we go int o more deta
ils about that, you men
tione d t hat you found th
e Israel is very well  
orga nize d as  you we re e s capi ng fro
m Hu ngary.  Wh en you arrived in
 the kibbutz , did you, did you 
share the feeling that th
e wa y t hat  the  ki bbutz wa
s  or gani zed wa s, was ver y good and s moot h a nd ,  
did you ha ve  any observa tions  a bout t hat?  
 

A:  The kibbutz  was al so ve ry we ll orga nize d, thi s 
wa s an ol d kibbutz a nd it was li ke a  clock wor k .  
Also, there was a hierar
chy whi ch naturall y some people di
dn't unde rsta nd, but I had no argume nt  
wit h that because I reali zed a pe
rs on who ca
me here fi ft y ye ars 
ago whe n ther e was not hing her e  
exce pt rocks  and Ara bs s hooting at 
the m, ha s, is more e qual , right , 
than somebody wh o arrives here 

toda y.  It wa s well r un, it was a wealt hy ki bbutz , 
there was ver y good food, 
there was culture, they 
made sur e t h at or chestras are co
mi ng, good ones, entertainment, no
, I ha d a bsol utel y no feeli ng of  
let down in this respect.  No, I ad mired the way they carried on.  Ju
st a little, just a little thing that  
shows that how they t hought of
 e veryt hing: s hoveling manur e, 
for e xa mpl e, of cour se, not  
somet hing that some body wa nts to 
do for the re s t  of hi s or her life, so or  was hing dis hes in the  
kitchen, so t here wer e, t here wer e certain t hings i n
 the kibbut z that it was not
 a, an area where yo u 
wer e assigned per manent ly, t hey 
wer e te mporar y.  And so e ve r yb
ody kne w t hat onc e in a mont h I  
have to shovel manure and once a 
month or t wic e a month, I have t o
 wash the dishes, so, t here were  
some  ot her , but  even thi s  was  taken c are of
, you know, I th
ink in a very 
human ma nner.

Q:  Did you have drea ms or ideas of
 what  exactl y you woul
d be doi ng whe n you went bac k to Hungary ,  
wa s t hat– wa s your s ense of where  you wa nt
e d t o go in your  
life very developed? 
 

A:  I was nai vel y thinking a bout go
i ng t o the uni vers ity a nd conti nui ng 
with my educatio
n to become a 
teacher, a high school t eacher, a
nd so I went back t hrough the 
Bospor us, Turkey, Black Sea, 
Roma ni a a n d then Hu
ngary.  Tra vell i ng thr ough Roma ni a by 
train, in 1949, ex
c us e me, 1951, wa s  
quite an experience, the 
people j ust  l ooked at 
me , looked at me
 and s i nc e ther e 
ar e quite a few 
Hungaria ns i n Romani a, I then– 
eventually they found out that 
I spea k Hungaria n, s o  there was  
always a Hungari an there an
d asked me  and I very naiv
ely give all the details of
 my  li fe  an
d all this 
and t hat, and I didn't underst and why the y looke d at
 me, j ust  looked at me, jus t  looke d at me, a nd  
also Roma ni a was tr e me ndousl y 
gra y  and I could onl y think of 
1984
, going across Ro mania .  And 
that was onl y t he be ginn
ing, 1951, you know?  
 

Q:  You're referring to the book, 
1984
? 
 

A:  Pardonme?  

 

Q:  You're referring to the book? 

 

A:  Ye s, I  re fe r t o th e b oo k 
1984
, or t he movie  rat her , oka y?   It 's  th
e same thing, but the movie is the 
one t hat I al ways keep i n my mi
nd wh en I think of Romania.  So
 I arrive d on t he Hungari an bor d er  
and here wa s an offi cer on the bor de
r looked at my pa pers a nd all th
i s and he , I 'll never forget what  
he tol d me, he said t o me, ﬁI don
't know where you come from, but 
it must have been ver y ba d, very  
bad t here , that you come  fro m.ﬂ  And he looke d 
at  me a nd sa id, ﬁ Welc o me to Hungar y.ﬂ   And t his  
wa s a bor de r  gua rd offi cer.  And I thought thi s  
is a strange thing, what
 does it mean?  We ll, I 
learne d very quic kly.  When I boa rde d the tr ain a gai
n on t he other side of the 
border, i t  wa s just a s  
gray as  c o mi ng t hr ough Roma ni a a n
d then finally when I 
arr i ved home, I looked ar ound, I r ealized 
that I was totally, totally misled.  
Never have I been mi sled before or
 after t he way I was.  I arrived 
there and it was the grayest , most 
c olorle ss , most sus pici ous , para noid s ociet y you c an i ma gine .  
And my bad peri od start ed wit h, of
 course, not being able
 t o get a  job, any jo
b, there was no one ,  
goi ng t o the uni versit y, of c our se, was  ridicul ous to 
think about beca use I wa s 
an unreliable element,  
I came  home, number one, fr om the 
West, I was an i mperi alist agent , 
a s fa r as  the y wer e c onc erne d,  
not onl y that , I was a Zi onist i mperi alist agent . 
 And it took me al
mos t  si x month t o get a j ob t o  
sweep a  floor, t o s w eep fl oors  a nd 
clean oil off the concre
te  in a  gar age , i n a state- owne d gara ge. 
 

Q:  How di d you get  the j ob?  

 

A:  Wit h gr eat c onnecti ons , 
t he fact t hat my father 
was from the worki ng class 
and ma ny of his brot he rs 
and their fri ends wer e invol ved, but mai nly t heir  
friends of where they co
me from, this subur b of 
Hungary, a  very poor  on
e, suburb of Bu dapest, where now 
the commu nist officials with great 
connections, but nobody wa
nte d any na mes , nobody
 wa nt ed t o stick out 
their  neck, they just 
somehow pushed so
me paperwork somewhere and 
I was an, kind of an a
uxiliary labor help, a no  
na
me pe rson whom t he y hired beca us e they neede d
 somebody to clean so
met hing.  And that wa s 
the onl y job I could get.  What hu
rt me even more was 
the fact  that my good fri ends on the street , 
some of them who stayed in Hu
ngar y, not too many beca use most of
 them escaped, but they woul d

not wa nt anything to do wit h me be
c ause most pe ople didn't want to t o
uch me , di dn't want to t alk t o  
me , they don't know me , they
 rat her woul d go t o t h e ot her side of
 t he s t reet  than  to  meet  me .  S o me  
probabl y out  of dis gus t t hat how 
stupid a human being can be to come
 ba ck t o t his, a nd others for  
fe ar.   
 
Q:  Bec ause you ha d bee n i n Israel?  

 

A:  Ye s, yes, be caus e  I ha d bee n out , it doe sn't ha ve  
to be , it di dn't have to be Israel , anyone , it was a  
totally paranoid society, 
everything that happened 
in the Soviet Union wa s 
copied the next day, you 
know.  So the, I worked 
i n this gar age  for about si x month a nd 
I always noti ced wit h gre at nostal gia,  
how the y ha ve thes e pos t ers about ur ging worke r s 
to go to college and I wanted to go to college, 
and I went  t o t he Part y secretar y of t he fi r m whi c
h ha d a bout t welve gar ages , ha d t o sign a  pa per  
that r ecommends you to go t o t he ne xt ste p a nd e ver
y ti me I  we nt t o se e hi m, he l aughed at me , he 
said, ﬁ You know that you are here by the grace of
 a fe w pe ople and not, you ha ve no merit s to go  
there.ﬂ  So t he, my br ea
k came when the secretary 
became very ill, the Part
y secretar y of t he fir m , 
and they sent out  a t e mporary Party secret ary, 
a n d s he wa s a  woma n, she  
wa s very busy whe n I  
entere d, you know, dirt y and over alls and all t his , a
nd when I t old her what  I want ed, I got a n, thi s  
opport unit y and tr y, now, when I t old her what I wa nt
e d, s he said, ﬁ Well , I don't ha ve ti me t o write 
you a r ecomme ndation.  I 'm gl ad th
at  a wor ker wants t o go t o co

don't you dictate what you need to my secret ary a
nd I wi ll just  sign it.ﬂ  So I passe d the  first hur dle,  
wit h thi s I we nt t o the  uni vers ity where I  ha d 
to submit this.  This
 was a committee, they 
intervie we d you a nd the y read your , you ha d to write your , your bi ogr a

everything, everythi

mmittee, admitting
 committee, the Young Communist  
Lea gue , the Communist Part y, one 
from the faculty, et cetera, abou
t, I would say, seve n, e i ght  
people .  And when they 
got t o c erta i n poi nts , t h ey said, ﬁ C
ome on, you mu st be
 joki ng that  you 
really think that, you kn
ow, you can come here.ﬂ  We ll, I le
ft  a nd as I  was  goi ng out  a ma n whos e  
na me was Mr. Bart os, he was on 
the facult y, t hi s was 
the Hungaria n Te acher s Aca d e my, t his wa s  
the universit y where I wanted to
 go, it was called the Teachers 
Academy, but it was part of the 
uni versit y.  He came
 out  and he said, ﬁHolczer, 
Holczer , didn't  your father 
play on a certain soccer  
tea m? ﬂ  I s ai d, ﬁ Ye s.ﬂ  He said, ﬁ Di dn't your fat h

and see, maybe 
since you were a minor wh en
 you left  the country, I w
ill try and write to the 
Mini stry of Educati on, 
ma ybe some thing can be  don

for t hree  mo nths, I we nt ba ck i n 
September and I went i n to the Part y secret ary's of
fi ce, t hey had no idea wh
o I was , they c oul dn't

 And I found hi m and he

He went into the Part y se cretar y, he c a me out a fe

He  sa id, ﬁThat  is  t he price .  You

They said, ﬁArrest them.ﬂ  And th
e y wer e, all t he  doctor
s ar ound Stali n were 
arr ested a few days 
be for e he di ed.  And t h en, whe n 
this happened, in Hungary, too, they were
 looking for Jewish 
doct ors or anybody who was,
 had anything to do wit h Zionist s  
because they called them the Zionist 
conspir acy against Stalin and t hey
 found me at t he c ollege.  The y
 had t o , since t his was a chai n 
reacti on, that  went down.  So th
e y found me and they t old me  to
 go home  and that I a m a Zionis t  
this and Zionist that.  And Stalin
 di ed three days l ater and I mean
, I wa s j u st he artbr oke n beca use it 
wa s be fore e xa ms a nd all  this a nd it was in M arc h and I wa s re ady t o ta ke 
my exa ms s oon and the n  
when everything died, di
ed down, and the so-calle
d Thaw, this is what th
ey called it politically, the 
Thaw st arted, then they called me back and they
 said forget about t he 
whol e thing a nd c o ntinue. 
 

Q:  You me nti o ned in t he l a st tape th
at your fathe r ha d, a fter he re turn
e d fr om Bor , he wa s appoint e d on 
a committee for housing? 
 

A:  M mm- h m m.  

 

Q:  Wh at , wh at hap pe ned  wi th h i s work ,  wit h his  
ca reer, di d he re main on
 that committee after the 
communist t ake over , or did he c ont i nue , you als o 
me nti one d that he we nt bac k to work for his 
former employer, did he 
continue to work for this former em
ployer?  Wh at beca
me of hi s car eer? 
 

A:  My father 's for mer employers, either died or es
ca ped i n 1947 or 1948, to 
t he West , so this, what I  
me ntione d, wa s a vol unt eer wor k.  Everybody, basical
l y, ha d to voluntee r  to do s o met hing.  Thi s  
wa s vol unte er wor k, he vol unte ere d to be appoi nted t o
 this position and this 
was not  a paid job.  
And it did not require a great deal of his ti me .  
He i mme diate l y looked fo
r some opportunit y an d 
started to work for a co-op, a lot 
of co-ops s t arte d and what co- ops
 wer e are  a group of peopl e who  
bande d toge ther a nd for me d a wh
at  you would call a, maybe a sma
ll enterprise, as l ong as t hey 
wo rked under the ruse of a coope
r ation and e veryt hing was divided,
 the pr ofit i f ther e was any, and 
they paid their taxes to the st
at e, t hi s was what the co mmunist
s consi der ed ki nd of a  happy i n-
bet ween of state far ms or state en
terprise and private enterprise. 
 Because private enterprise was 
pha sed out gradually, exc ept in c ases suc h as a s h
oe maker tha t , you know, repairs shoe s, but eve n  
for t hat, eventuall y, they had co-o
ps, shoemaker co-ops or tai l or co-o
ps or this, but a fe w, a few of 
thos e branches, that  you coul d not  rea lly work any 
other wa y e xce pt i n a co
-op, but he wa s working 
for a co- op where he r ose event uall
y, he wa s a ve ry s ma r t ma n, a nd he  
ros e to be kind of a mi dle ve l  
ma na ger, but  also worki n g and th
is co-op was working with a lot 
of wome n who woul d then get the  
mer cha ndise  and do it at home .  Th
ey were ma king shoppi
ng nets and shopping bags and things like  
that that anybody ca n do on a se wi
ng machi ne a t  home .  And the n 
the y would bring it in and so 
actuall y they had a very, a very small  area, a ver y
 s mall base and just a warehous e and he enj oye d 
this, he e njoyed it a nd he wa s ver y
 much li ke d.  The onl y pr oble m he
 ha d occ asi onal l y is that the y  
asked hi m, because he wa
s such a good worker
, and he received all kinds 
of awar ds t
h at he didn't  
really want  partic ularl y beca use  he  wa s not very
, you know, infatuate d w
ith the communist system, 
they al wa ys wa nte d hi m t o join the Pa rty beca us e he
 wa s a per fe c t, what t h ey
 called cadre, cadre, he 
comes fr om the worki ng class, he
 wa s a hard- w or king ma n, he was 
a n honest ma n, he  rose fr o m  
not hing to a  mi dl evel mana ger, s o he was a n ide a
l pers on.  But he ne ve r joine d, he always s aid , 

ﬁNo, absol ut ely no.ﬂ   So 
that, he wa s such 
a good wo rker, they
 le ft hi m alone.

Q:  Did your mo ther have to start working? 
 

A: No, my mother was totally ju
st a mother a nd a house wi fe , s he 
ne ver ha d any, any, and I ca n't  
re me mber my mot her  havi ng, you know, polit ical
 opinion or a nyt hi ng like t hat , s he had ot he r 
intere sts.  She read a l ot and 
we nt to the movies a nd she love
d visiting ar ound dur ing t he da y, she 
wa s kind of a social butterfly. 
 

Q:  You me nti oned t hat  in
 sc hool you we re st udying
 geogr aphy and history?  
 

A:  Ye s,  that  wa s my , i n coll
ege , geogra phy and hist or y. 
 

Q:  And that t h e other st udents who were in school
 with you wer e, were also
 di dn't have a lot of  
symp athy fo r communism.   Did you 
all get together with your classm
a t es a nd did you, did you tal k  
about politics often, what wa
s the mood like among 
your, your, your fellow students? 
 

A: Interestingly, with most peop
le, you could talk politic
s.  You know, 
eventually, throughout these 
years, we i solated t he ones who we
re s uspi cious t o us a nd– bec aus
e they were al ways eager beaver 
Part y worker s and give bi g spe eches a nd s o me of 
t he m di d big spee che s an
d we kne w t hat we can 
still talk to them, they™re 
just careerists and they just want 
to go ahead.  But I 
would say the great 
majority, even in the wo
rst days, we could 
still discuss things.  Obviousl
y, we didn't do it on the 
street , we di dn't do it  el sewhere 
except in our own home or in a re
sta urant  where ther e was a lot  of 
nois e a nd t h ey c oul dn't discer n, you know, who sa ys wh
at.  So in this respect,
 we did not really ha ve  
a ki nd of a prison at mos pher e i n c oll ege .  And 
our profe ss ors , I woul d s a y ei ght y per cent of t he m 
wer e  ver y much agai nst t he re gi me a n d oc casi ona l l
y the y let t h at go i n very, you know, a mbiguous  
state me nts .  We r ecogni z ed it i mme di ately a nd all this
, but just to give you on
e exa mple, mo st of us, 
we  ha d t o go to Rus sia n 
instr ucti on ever y day, most
 of us either didn't show
 up or i f  we di d, we 
didn't li ste n, we didn't  lea rn anyt hing, and a fter goi
ng t hrough c ollege, at the  end you ha d to t ake a  
state exam.  And I, the 
exam in Hungar
y at that time was you had to
 draw a written note on which 
you had a topic.  An
d you were  gi ven fi ftee n mi
nutes to take notes on th
at topic from your me mo ry, 
you were  gi ven a pencil  and s o me paper , a nd when
 you we r e calle d upon, t h
is was your t ur n a nd 
you c oul d ta lk a bout, intr oduce yo
ur t opic and t here was a committ ee.
  And I  we nt t o  my Russi a n  
exam, and this happened to other 
people too, and I drew 
my topic and I couldn't even read the title,  
let alone, couldn't read the 
title, I just, in these years I just never 
bothered to read, to learn enough t o  
read.  Today of cours e, I ' m not ve r y proud of t his , beca use now I k
now that the more languages you 
speak, you know, the more lives 
you have, but t
hose days, this was a po
litical statement, they 
coul dn't be li eve it, t hey j ust couldn't belie ve it be cau
s e I wa s straight A in my s ubj ects  and s o ther e  
wa s tre me ndous  ani mosit y 
toward me  fr om the poli
ce, from the Party secr etary and all t he other s.

Tape 7, Si de  A 
 
Q:  This is tape three, side A of an interview with 
Robert Holczer.  Do you wa
nt to continue with what 
you wer e s a ying a bout your . . . 
 

A:  Oh , th e R us s ian e xa m.   An d th
en I fo und out later that some 
of my classmat es had the same 
problem and, eventually, th
ey deci de d not to, not t o ha ve us ba ck, s o they j ust gave us a  D and they 
wer e very angry about it .  But in
 a way it was thei
r fault , t oo, beca use  how could we  ge t up t o t hat  
poi nt, going through all c l asse s, di dn™t  they reali ze 
that something is
 wrong?   Well, 
t his, I reme mber  
this very distinctly, that that
 was one way to show our reacti
on t o what wa s going on.  And  
otherwise, even the ones who were
 very active in the Co
mmu nist Party, most of
 t he m always  gave  
us a  si gnal t hat t his  is all  a s how, t her e is not hi ng 
to wor r y about.  Ther e were very fe w pe ople .  So 
when I left t he college, at that 
ti me , you, I beca me a teac he r and 
we we re suppose d to go t o the 
countryside, they c oul d not, you coul d not tea ch i n
 Buda pest t he fi rst ye ar and I was then assi gned 
to a little, small village, not far fr om
 Vacz, fr om my mother's birthpla
ce, only a fe w mi les and taught 
there for a year.  And this was 
a small village of a mi
nority, Hungary has very
 fe w minorities, but 
they ha ve  some  Sl ov
ak mi noriti es i n  the  Nort h, t hese  were  Sl
ova ks and t h ey s pea k, the y s poke ver y 
little Hungarian, but they would not admit it beca
use they were afraid that there would be 
reper cus sion, so t he y as ked for a Hungari an t eac he
r, t he y c o uld have as ked for a Slovak- spe aki n g 
teacher, too.  And it was qu
ite an experience, but i t has nothing to
 do with being Je
wi sh or wit h the 
Hol oc aust , none of t hat c a me up, it 
was just a t ota lly di ffere nt one .  
And then after this year that I 
spe nt i n– I  made  conta ct again,
 I wanted to get back with 
a youth organi zati on and I found  
interestingly that the Co
mmuni st Youth Or ga niza tion, t he Pion
eer or gani z ation pr obably c oul d us e  
me bec aus e, I me an I went thr o
ugh the boy scouts, I went t hroug
h the Zionist s, I had s o me ver y  
defini te ideas and I answered an 
a d a nd be ca me a  director of a su
mmer camp.  They
 l ooked for a  
young te acher who, I 
ha d a bout t we l ve other young teac her s 
wit h me  a nd it was  
in Budapest, it was 
just a day c a mp, and it  turne d 
out  t o be s uch a good experi ence
 that the local Communist Party  
secret ary asked me if I woul d like to
 come and teach in the di strict. 
 And I  said, ﬁ Nat ur ally, this is 
it!ﬂ  And so I was tr ans f e rred t o, jus t  t o a subur b 
of Budapest and I taught 
there until the Revolution  
came and I  escaped again. 
 

Q:  Wh en did you grad
uate fr om college? 
 

A:  '5 3.  

 

Q:  And so it wa s in '54?  

 

A:  Yea h, t he Re vol ution c a m
e in '56, oka y, so. . . 
 

Q:  So you ta ught for t w o 
years in a suburb of. . . 
 

A:  Yea h, ri ght .  One year  in 
t he countr ysi de and t w o years in
 this  s uburb.  Junior hi gh. 
 

Q:  You mentioned that  you were involved with th
e Democratic Teacher 's Un
i o n at  one  point?    
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
62 
 
 
A:  DuringtheRe vol ution, 
t hey as ked me to organi ze
 a Democrati c Te
acher's Union.  I wa s not a Pa rty 
me mber, they knew that I wa s not also an anti-Part
y me mber  either  be ca use , a nd t his  I want ed t o  
bring out a n d e mphasiz e , that as
 a J ew in Hungary, you c ould neve
r be truly a n anti -communist  
beca use you kne w one t hing, a s lo
ng as the Communist Party was 
in power, t here would be no 
pogroms  a n d your  li fe  i s sa fe.  And this  is  
what  ha ppe ne d a fte r c o mmunis m, and c o mmuni st fall , 
most of my relatives and friends 
who were in Hungar y, t his wa s thei
r gr eatest fear, t hat what wil l  
happen to them now.  
And anti-Semitism is 
now ra mpa nt i n East ern Euro
pe, in Hungary, too.  So  
this is just an interlude, I just
 wanted to say something about that
.  So I wa s just teaching in this 
suburb and until the 
Revolution and as a, and 
during the Revolution, they
 sent fo r me and they 
wanted me to get the Democratic
 Te acher s Union t oget her , variou
s de mo cratic or gani zations, a nd 
all this.  And I came
 out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town 
council , the district council and one day there wa
s some fighting out ther
e and I sa w a bunch of  
people with armbands, the Arrow 
Cr oss armb ands.  And I looked out
 t he wi ndow and al l  my desir e 
to e ver do a nyt hing or t o sta y t here ,  just  went  a w
ay.  Right in that mo ment. 
 I realized that this is 
now when I  ha ve t o le a ve.  Eve n
 t h ough I  ha d a ver y good li fe, th
e last three years, after I was 
trans ferre d t o Budape st, I had a very, very good 
life , relatively speaking, 
you know?   A good s alar y, 
I started to write for th
e  ne ws paper, the– stor ies  about young 
pe opl e.  I r an ca mps and financi ally , 
and I  got all  the re cognit i on a nd a wa rds a nd all t his
, I coul dn't complain.  
But  whe n I sa
w, when I  
sa w tha t , t he  symbol , I went
 home and I sai d, ﬁThis is it .  I wil l  
never ret ur n except  to visit.ﬂ  And I 
told my pa re nts, ﬁI n t w o 
weeks, I'm leaving.ﬂ   
 
Q:  Where did you, you men
tione d that you ha d a, you had a rea l
 enthusia s m f or worki ng wit h young 
people a nd t hat see ms to be some thi n g that you di
d for most of your a dul t life a nd at t he ti me , what , 
where did your , wher e did that en
t husias m c o me fr om and what, wh
a t  wer e you tea chi ng, were you  
teachi ng them si mply geography or
 wer e you tr ying to
 teach t hem a broade
r range of t hings? 
 
A: We ll, when I was transf
e rred t o Buda pest , i m me di ately I start e
d to t eac h ge ogra phy, the y ha d t hese 
so-ca lled pi oneer house s, thes e were  buil dings wher
e t he kids can come back
 in the afternoon and 
depending on thei r int er ests, joi n gr oups, stu
dy groups .  And I was r unn
ing the  ge ography gr ou p 
which was a lot of introduction an
d si mulati ons of  how a river  is mea nde ri ng and the n old river is 
me anderi ng, a l ot of t est s, ha nds- on t ype  of acti vi tie
s.  I took them to hike
 and I t aught  the m how, 
orient ation i n nat ure a nd all, e verythi ng t hat was r o
manti c in t he boy scout s. 
 And from this, I ki nd  
of organized a group of very en
thusi astic kids who eve ntuall y would foll ow me anywhere , you  
know, and it appealed to me
 as a young, and I can s
till do that, and so then pe
ople saw this and they 
hired me to run big camps.  But 
I always neglected the political thin
g, that was not, I never really  
cared for the politics, but I emphasi
zed the romantic thing.  I ev

fi ft een years later , some of t hes
e  ki ds  were r unning the s a me ki
nd of ca mp s and organi zations and 
they al ways came and they said, ﬁY
ou know, i f you ha d tol d us t hat
 in the middle of the night we  
have to leave our homes 
so that nobody will wake 
up and assemble in a plac
e, we would have bee n  
up there.  And we would have bee n
 following you all the wa
y out to the border.ﬂ  I didn't tell them 
that I  was leaving because I didn't wa
nt them to even have
 this silly idea, but 
after I l eft  some o f 
them learned about it and 
three of them came after me  and ende
d up i n Switz erla nd, but event uall y 
we nt ba ck t o  Hungary.  So occ asi onal l y, when I 
am in Hungary, I do bump 
into them and I go o u t 
and l ook up some , and th
ose who wer e  ver y nic e  t o me, I al wa
ys se e.  I even 
see the Communist 
Part y secr eta r y, the woman who wa s 
influential to get me, 
I took my wi fe , too, 
to see her duri ng the 
late ‚ 70s  and early ‚80s , she and her hus ba nd, I j ust, the y we r e good
 people.  They 
came from the 
old communist unde rgr o und, 
you know?   And t h ough we  ne ver talk
ed about it , I ' m s u re the y wer e 
just as dis appoi nted in what ha ppe ne d to Marx id
eas as most other people .  But the y would never  
disc uss  it be caus e t hey were t oo loyal  to t he Par ty. 
 
Q:  Wh en 1956 came and some  of th
e de monst rations  start ed, wer e yo
u intrigued in an
y wa y or did you 
mai nly feel concerned about the 
fascist elements that you were 
seei ng?   Did you go to t he bi g 
de monstr ation on October  23rd?  
 

A:  Yeah.  I was on the str eet  all the ti me because 
I believed that I have this
, anybody, most  Hol oca ust  
survi vors ha ve an i ntuiti on, ha ve a, some how, a  
sixth s e ns e  and we al wa ys wa nte d to rea d the  
crowd.  The mood of the 
crowd.  And so I was in the street a
ll t he ti me , wat ching wha t 's happe ning, 
kind of se ns ing t he unde rcurre nt
.  I was like an ani m
al and I  kne w that I  kne w exa c tl y what  was 
goi ng on.  And I kne w that these people eve ntuall y 
coul d be up to no good or quite a few of the m  
coul d be up to no good because, 
you know, the leopar d doesn't lose
 its spots and even t hough it all  
started with great democratic slogans, eventually 
aft er two we eks , it did di sinte grate a n d there wer e  
a lot of fasci st groups and I did not
 want to li ve under Rus sia n t anks,
 but I was glad, myself, that the  
Ru ssian tanks came  back.  I just didn't wa nt to live 
under t hat s yste m either, but  at le ast i t saved t he  
lives of a lot of people because 
there wer e ugl y incide nts.  The  Re
volution started fo
r t wo weeks, the 
fir st one we ek was ki nd of de mocra tic and l o
oked like democrati c and 
the sec ond wee k, j ust  
ever ythi ng disinte grate d and the cr owd we nt bers
e rk a nd I di dn't tr ust  any of that  a ny more. 
 

Q:  You also me ntioned th
at there was an extr eme a mount of an
ti-Semitism during th
at time.  Wo uld 
you just tell me some exampl
es of wh at was going on?  
 

A:  We ll, unfort unat ely, a fte r looki ng at all the count
ries where a nti-Se mitism is so rampa nt, has bee n  
and still is, I must 
conclude that all Ca
tholic countries are that wa
y in Eastern Europe, only the 
Cat holi c countries .  Pol and, Hung
ary, Slovakia and Croatia, these ar
e t he countries wh
er e, and some 
of them have very little Jews, in 
Poland there are only 
a fe w thousand Je
ws left .  I have experienced  
anti-Semitism all the time,
 [c oughs
] e xcuse me , a n d 
even when I go home nowa
da ys t o visit , well I 
haven't been to Hungary fo
r the last three years, but the letters 
I receive from my relatives constantl y  
refer to t hat and my fami ly was ne
ver  very much intere sted i n  brin
ging thi s out beca use they are,  
rather, they consider themselv
e s Hungari ans, the  ones who are 
living in Hungary today and I ' m 
always sur pr i sed t hat t his is a main concer n to t hem
, so apparently this situ
ation has ne ver c hange d.  
In 1919, Hungary became the fi rst 
fa scist country of Europe, even 
before Hitler, and stayed that 
wa y, at lea s t, even t oda y under the  curre nt, t he  un
dercurrent is very ant i-Semiti c, t h e Jews are 

responsible  for e ver ythi ng j u
st like in the Middle Ages.

Q:  How long di d you ha ve t o pr epa r
e t o leave , you made t he de cis i on 
t o l eave and then
, how long did it 
take  be fore  you act ually l eft  a n
d how did you make
 pr eparations? 
 

A:  We ll, t he Revol ution was de feate d in the fir s
t wee k of Nove mber and it took me  about ten t o 
fourteen days to get going.  I ju
st wanted to say goodb
ye to my good fr iends 
and my fa mily and also  
I had a cousin who wa
nted to come with me an
d I had to do a l
ittle preparation th
ere, too, because 
he wa s just a high sc hool graduate a nd a ver y gr een
 fell ow a t  that.  And eve ntuall y he brought hi s  
fri end, s o t h e thre e of us starte d out a nd i n a bout 
t en, t en t o fourtee n days , 
I can't reme mber exactl y, 
but no more than t wo we ek
s.  I j ust wanted t o see exactl y what
 works, what  does
n't  wor k, how ca n I  
appr oac h t he  bor der , t he most pract ic al way, a  lot  of
 people were practically 
there  a nd t h en c apt ure d  
and brought back to Budapest.  
And the repercussi on was nothing but still, 
you didn't want to go  
through all this and then in the la
st  se cond, j ust be fore
 you would go over t o 
Aust ria, captured, you  
know, be captured, so I kind of 
did a little homework, that
's all, and tried to 
think of the practic al 
aspects of how to do that. 
 
End of Ta pe 7, Si de  B 
 

 
Tape 8, Side A  
 

Q: I™m going to sit next to you, R
obert, so we™re not leaning too much. 
 

A: Yeah, yeah. I– basically, I wa
nt as little to do with Hungary 
as possible, and Hungary usually 
come up in my dreams,
 in a nightma r e. 
 
Q: Itdoes? 
 

A: Yes. I... obviously I™m not that devoted to Hungary.  I™m not a person who really believes much 
in national identity, you know, I just
... I feel that cause more pr
oblems, that and religion, than 
anything else, so I™ve never been a patriot of basi
cally any country, and ther
e... I still am not.  So, 
does it sound all right? Yeah, an ey
e on there. All those countries, so
 they wouldn™t turn Fascist.  
 

Q: Okay, I™m going to slate the tape.   

 

A: Okay,yeah. 

 

Q: It™s... 

 

A: This was probably off the record. 

 

Q: Yeah,that™s– 

 

A: You don™t want to– although I can, you know, I can– 

 

Q: What we can– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
65 
 
 
 
A: I™m willing to say this on tape, too. 

 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: Doesn™tmatter. 

 

Q: Yeah. Okay.  It™s March 17
th
, 1999, and we™re in the home of 
Robert Holczer, in Paris, 
Kentucky, and conducting an interview that™s... th
at™s based on his post-Holocaust life, just 
basically following up on... on a couple of other 
interviews we™ve done for the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, and this intervie
w is sponsored jointly by the US Holocaust 
Memorial Museum and the Kentucky Oral Hi
story Commission. And I™m Arwen Donahue, here 
we go. We ll, I™m curious, before we– 
 

A: Yeah,yeah. 

 

Q: –go into the chronology, to hear more about 
your theory of nations. 
Did... you were talking a 
little earlier, just about how you really have an
 ambition of going back to Hungary and finding 
the people who are living in the same  house that
 you were during war time. So, do you... but then 
again, you don™t have a lot of 
strong feelings for Hungary. Do
 you dislike going back, when you 
have visited?  Or, how do you f
eel about visiting there, even? 
 

A: Well– 

 

Q: I™llholdit. 

 
A: Yeah.  I don™t mi nd visiting Hungary, but... and 
the reason I don™t mi nd visiting, because I still 
have friends and some  relatives I care to see and 
I care to be with. But, on the whole, when I am 
there, I feel like a total strange
r, which is not... which is not just because of what happened to 
me , it™s also a tremendous generation gap. Most 
of the people of my ag
e, are... [dog barks] 
probably you have to stop that. 
 
Q: Yeah, I™m wondering what... Hungary– 

 

A: Yes, that I... as I me ntioned, I like to be with
 people, but the feeling of 
totally estranged, I realize 
is not just what happened... because of what happe
ned to me , but also because I am now a... I... 
reaching the age when most people are just not 
around any more. And I... it™
s a strange thing to 
walk through streets where you used to play, 
and you know that nobody is there any more from 
your previous life.  However, when I hear some anti-Semitic rema rks, which you can hear often 

in Hungary, even today, or I see so
me very rude behavior, then I re
alize that I am very lucky not 
to be here, yeah. So... and I have never beena patriot of Hungary. I™ve never had a Hungarian 

passport in my life. I™ve always been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary, 

had a big... a ZS on it, which meant I was a Jew. 
So, since I was never a 
first class citizen, not 
even a second class, no citizen at
 all, I just don™t have any att
achment to the country, as such. I 
do have attachme nt to certa
in places where I grew up. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
66 
 
 
Q: Are you an American citizen? 
 

A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 
1961, and so I always kid people who ask me, when 
they hear my accent, what happened to me , 
how come a foreigner is teaching American 
governme nt?  Some  of my students question me  and 
I said, ﬁWell, I have been an American much 
longer than you, and your parents.ﬂ And so– 
 

Q: Do you feel more of an attachme nt to being... 
to America than Hungary in any sense? I mean, by 
being a citizen, by having lived here for so long? 
 

A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that I 
do not have nationalistic 
feelings, as most people 
would have. The flag or a national anthem doesn™t 
really mean much to me
. I don™t consider that 
patriotism. But I like a lot of thi
ngs here, especially the constitution, 
and I appreciate the fact that 
I can live a fr ee life and for them I am very grat
eful and my patriotism ma
nifests itself this way, 
and not by waving the flag. 
 

Q: Did you know anything about the Constitution 
before you came , or how did you learn about... 
about the Constitution? 
 

A: No, I didn™t, because I couldn™
t... I couldn™t read it, I di dn™t sp
eak English, and in Hungary, they 
were not very eager to translate the Ameri
can Constitution as I was growing up. But when I 
came here, and I began to learn English and even
tually when I went back to school, and was a 
history ma jor, I had to... so, base... my first encounter with the Constitution was in college, in 

Fresno.  
 

Q: And what... what impressed you about it, or 
what was your response to it when you first 
_______________? 
 

A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document,
 naturally, and I still 
admi re the people who 
wrote it. I consider them genius
es, creating some thing from nothi
ng, truly, and I wish that we 
had some  of that caliber walk
ing around today in Wa shington. 
 

Q: Was becomi ng a citizen of the United States an
 important event for you?  
 Did it mean anything? 
 

A: Yes, because  I never in my life held any kind of
 citizenship or  any kind of passport. And the fact 
that now I have some thing that will... unfortunately, that in the 20
th
 century, the fact that you are 
a human being, with two eyes and a nose and ev
erything else on you, is not
 sufficient proof for 
you to travel around the world and be protected by in
ternational law. Considering all this, I felt 
much safer now that I have a country behind me  and I am protected in case I am in trouble 

some where. Yes, it meant a great deal, because th
ose days, I liked to trav
el a lot, and it was a 
sense of security that I had from it. 
 

Q: Well, going back to then, when you firs
t arrived in the United States, in 1956? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
67 
 
 
Q: Do you remember your concepti
ons, your ideas about what the Un
ited States was then and what 
you actually found and what your
 first impressions were? 
 
A: Well, since I came from a Communis t  country, an
d before that a Fascis
t country, initially the 
U.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even 
painted as any country th
at is desirable to live 
in. All I heard about it was negative. However, I 
was raised in a fa mily, my father was a very 
enlightened ma n, and he raised me  on the truth, so 
I knew that this is the 
country of the free. And 
I had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered
 me  a great deal about comi ng here, and also 

I, as I me ntioned before, I did not come  here... 
this was not my first choice, you know, I had to 
follow my cousin. What bothered me , I have... I wa
s never that much in favor of modern times 
and fast times, and a landscape with skyscrapers, 
that was not my vision of
 my fut ure li fe. I was 
a typical European, who felt a lot mo re comforta
ble in... on a narrow street with half-timbered 
houses, and a lot of people on the 
street, and sidewalk cafés, and li
ttle restaurants. Then to go to 
a country where none of this would exist. So I 
had my reservations this
 way, e motionally. I had 
no qualms about the United States politically, but 
I was worried about how can I adjust to a place 
that doesn™t have much traditions. 
 

Q: Did you find that to be true, that your impre
ssion was that there was no tradition he re, or did 
you– 
 

A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nos
talgic when it comes to, for example Christmas. I 
consider our life here quite pl
astic and I understand w
hy. I am not faulting anyone for it. I know 
that a country that is so young as the United St
ate, just never had the opportunity to develop 
those traditions that European countries have, th
at existed now for thousands of years. And so... 
But it is just sad. I feel that a 
great deal of problems come  from 
the fact that we are so young, and 
we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager
 who just became  totally uncoordinated.  
 

Q: But you me ntioned that your fa
ther taught you about America, th
at it was... that it was the Land 
of the Free. What did that mean to you?  What did that mean to him?  
 

A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he
 was around, and we had an opportunity, we listened 
to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I th
ink, but I am not so sure, even the Voice of 
America could be heard. And, of course there,
 we heard a great deal about the western... so-
called western world. And realized
 that while we are living ther
e as pr actical sl aves, in the 
western world, people have a very good life. 
And that appealed to me  a great deal. 
 

Q: How long were you in Ca mp Kilmer, when you 
first arrived in the U.S., in New Jersey? 
 
A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was 
just a screening process 
to just give a very 
superficial screening, so certain elements, unde
sirable elements would not sneak into the 

country. They were looking for me mbers of the 
Communist Party and un
fortunately, people who 
were sick, because with certain illnesses, you co
uld not gain entrance to the United States. For 
example, if you had TB. And then, from there... 
and also, they were in charge of sending you 
some where. So, they were kind of dispatchers. 
 

Q: So it was then that you got sent to– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
68 
 
 
 
A: SaintLouis. 

 

Q: SaintLouis. 

 

A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri. 

 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, what did you do there? 

 

A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was 
welcomed by the fa mily, by that time , adopted, of 
course, just symbolically, my cousin, and we 
were united. They were a... you mi ght say upper-
mi ddle class American family with some  problem
s and they thought that 
getting two Hungarian 
refugees would probabl y mitigate thei r ci rcumstan
ces. And I was, within weeks, working for a 

wholesale jewelry comp any. I was 
just a stockboy. And, very simple work, and that was my job. 
And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with
 me , of course, we were walking around and 
going to a movie, even though we couldn™t understa
nd much of it. But just planning, eventually, 
to be integrated into this society. And on w
eekdays we worked, we went home, we watched 
television. And the family was... it was a very in
teresting situation, becau
se the man was manic 
depressive and we could never 
figure out what his moves would 
be next. The... his wife was a 
very darling woman, and she was the one who trie
d to figure this out, that with two Hungarian 
refugees, the situation mi ght change. They had 
a mentally retarded s
on in an institution, who 
came home  on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young ma n, who was 

always creating some thing electrical, or mech
anical, even. So, we had good relationship with 
him, and I kept up with my host mot her for a long
 time, and only when we left for Europe, that 
was the time  when I lost contact and I don™t kno
w where she is. I understand they got a divorce 
after. It was in... unbearable to live 
with some body who was so unpredictable. 
 

Q: You mean when you left for Eur
ope to move there with Jan and–  
 

A: Mm-h m,mm-h m,yes. 

 

Q: ... much later. Uh-huh. Did you have the idea 
at that time , that you would be staying in the 
United States?  I know you had the idea originally th
at you didn™t want to st
ay, and you wanted to 
go back to Europe. We re you thinking, after 
you had arrived, that you 
would actually stay?  
What... Wha t  were your thoughts about the future? 
 

A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because ther
e was no way for me  to go back to Europe, even if 
I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country 
and get some  legal status anywhere. The reason 

was, once you were placed in a country, you coul
dn™t really do much about it any mo re. So I 
knew I had to ma ke the best of my s t ay here, but 
I certainly di dn™t want  to stay in Saint Louis, 
because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in
 Saint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also 
against just about anyone. I worked ma inly, th
is is my fate, with Germa n, it was a German 
company ba sically, a German fa mily, German 
workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name  
a group or a race around the world about whom they
 were not talking during the day, always in 
very derogatory terms. And then I found out that 
Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that 
time. You were either of German des cent, or 
you were Black. And luckily, when I became  very, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
69 
 
 
very upset about this, my Black fellow workers,
 first by sign language, probably, and later on, as 
I learned my  English, pidgin English back the
n, they invited me  on weekends to be... to go 
around with them, because they said
 one cannot just sit at home . And they introduced me  to the 
Saint Louis that most people who were born there,
 probably, wouldn™t know. I went to just about 
every nightclub, I heard just about
 every jazz band that there exis
ted those days, that came  to 
Saint Louis. And ma ny times, in a huge dance ha
ll, I was the only white face. And of course, 
someti mes, I ran into almost 
trouble too, because of that.  
 
Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that 
it would be the group of Bl
ack co-workers, rather 
than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, 
or did you think that that had anything to do 
with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendsh
ips with the German de
s cent co-workers?  What 
was the story with that? 
 

A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews
, and... but that didn™t pr event them from being 
prejudiced against me  too, and they knew that they
 were... that I was Jewi sh. It was just a general 
thing in Saint Louis, to look 
down on anyone who is not an established person. And I felt this, 
everywhere. I just... and the situation at home, wh
ere I was staying with these people, was also 
not very happy. And that, I thi
nk, contributed to my thoughts that
, how nice it would be to go to 
some other place.  
 

Q: So you came with some  ideas about this being th
e Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see 
how... what a division there was between Blacks and 
Whites in this country and the wa y that the 
White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality? 
 

A: Yes, yes, that surprised me  very, very mu
ch. In one of these w
eekend excursions, I was 
introduced to a very charmi ng college student, 
she was Black, and we started to date. And 
eventually, she explained to me  that we cannotsee each ot her any more, 
because her life was in 
danger, and my life was in danger. And she 
said, ﬁYou don™t understand 
this now, but twenty 
years from now you will understand. And as much 
as it hurts me , we have to stop seeing each 
other.ﬂ  And that was my first great introducti
on to prejudice, really, 
on a personal, you know, 
basis. 
 

Q: So, up until then, you really hadn
™t realized what a strong di vi
sion there was, or what a taboo 
there was against interracial relationships? 
 

A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society th
at was tremendously prej
udiced and I thought I 
am comi ng t o a society that is much more diffe
rent and much more positive about these things. 
And it really surprised me that there was so mu
c h dislike and hatred, th
at I knew could not be 
erased very soon.  
 

Q: Were there any civil rights ac
tivities going on in Saint Louis duri
ng the time  that you were there?  
Was there... were there any at– you know, discussi
ons, just in the wake of the Brown versus 
Board of Education decision that
 interracial education would 
be happening?  I me an, were you 
aware, or... that the schools w
ould stop being segregated?  We re 
there any things like that 
happening in Saint Louis that you we re aware of? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
70 
 
 
A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So 
I only lived there for five months  or so. And 
I... my English was not good enough to read newspa
pers or even discuss 
anything political with 
people. I di d watch television, because I felt that
 it was a good way to learn, and I got certain 
ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway 
I ever me t, you know, this kind of a problem in 
Saint Louis, no. 
 

Q: How did you learn English? 

 

A: Well, when you are... this is my great argumen
t against bilingual educa
tion, that when you have 
to, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English. No, 

for Europeans, English is an easy language to le
arn. Not so easy to writ
e, but to learn, because 
it™s... the grammar is mu ch simpler than some  Eur
opean languages. I just 
put my mi nd to it, and I 
decided, if I am here, I might as
 well do it. I could have gone to 
Cleveland, for example , and live 
my life as a Hungarian, but I want
ed to be integrated into the 
society, and I love the English 

language, that™s the truth. I thi
nk of all the languages, 
even though I admit that French is a very 
beautiful language to listen to, 
but I love the English language, I 
love... and this is why I love to 
read and I learned just by listening and my w
illpower, I think, helped 
me to get through. And 
among all the people eventually I a
ssociated with, who arrived at th
e same time, I ma de the most 
progress, because I just decided 
I don™t want to belong to any 
Hungarian club and I don™t want 
anything to do with this. I rea
lly want to learn English.  
 

Q: It was a... you me ntioned in th
e last interview that it was a frie
ndship with... was it a professor at 
Washington University?  Was that
 how you got out of Saint Louis and to Aspen?  How did your 
acquaintance with th
is ma n come  a bout? 
 

A: He saw a newspaper article about us, in the... 
I think it was the Saint L
ouis Post Dispatch. He... 
Because we were the first ones, my cousin and I 
think the first Hungarian refugees. And he cut it 
out and mi splaced it some where, and only a few 
month after, some how th-the article came up 
and he called us and he invited bo
th of us to dinner, to his ho
use. And by that time my  cousin 
was gone, so I went and I me t hi m and his family. He
 just wanted to socialize and talk about the 
days in Hungary. He came  to... he had come  to th
is country before I, right after World Wa r II. 
And his wife was a former Ger man ps
ychiatrist, and they had one son. And– 
 

Q: But they were not Jewish, were they, or– 

 

A: Yes,yes– 

 

Q: ... were... they were Jewi sh? 

 

A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn™t 
have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I last... I 
lost contact with them in... some ti me s in the sixtie
s, and reestablished it last year when I went to 
Aspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professo
r, Mr. Chabay, was already dead, but she was 
there, visiting from Florida, where she lives in 
a retireme nt home. And so
 I had a good chat with 
her about the good old days.

Q: When you me t the m, did they ask you about your
 experiences during the wa
r?  Did you talk at all 
about that?  
 
A: Yes, they ask me  a great deal 
about that, naturally. But they were
 also very much interested in 
my... at... in my present experiences then, whic
h were also not very good. Some thing happened 

to me after I moved out of my original family, 
and established my independence. For a couple of 
month, I lived with a Hungarian 
couple who rented a room, because they needed some  money, 
and they had a room with a separate entrance, 
so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad 
experience, and so I was just ready to leave, an
ywhere, in the United States. And this is when 
they showed me  a film of Aspen, Col orado, wher
e they had the summer home , and where he was 
a me mber of the music festival st aff,
 and said, ﬁYou are comi ng with us.ﬂ  
 

Q: Do you want to say anything about the 
experience that you had, that was bad? 
 

A: Well, it was... I don™t even know if anyone in th
e future would completely understand it, but it 
was just a strange coincidence that my fathe
r™s company™s... every company in Hungary had a 
Party secretary, they were in charge of prac
tically life and death, wh
at was going on. And my 
father™s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of
 the person who rented the room. So, he and his 
wife immediately, when this came  to the surface,
 they imme diately were afraid that I mi ght 
report on them back to Hungary, which I had no 
interest, I couldn™t car
e less, except one day 
they... I heard a big argume nt and I realized 
that they were arguing about abortion. The ma n 
wanted his wife to abort, she was pregnant. Th
ey were very... social 
climbers, real social 
climbers, who were constantly adding up, ever
y penny on a piece of pape r, figuring out when 

and how they can move, they can buy more furn
iture, they can buy this, they... a child was the 
last on their priority list. And so
 I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came  home, 
and she was in a pool of blood. She had done some
thing to herself, and I found her, and it–

Tape 8, Side B 
 

Q: This is tape one, side B, of an 
interview with Robert Holczer. Go ahead. 
 

A: And so the young ma n knew now that I... we have 
a secret, and he was afra
id that I would report 
this back to his mother. And of course, I had 
absolutely nothing to do with his mother. Then, 
next, the mail from home stopped. I did not ge
t any, any, any ma il, which was very strange, 
because I had an agreement with my parents that 
every week we shall write to each other. They 
received letters from me, desper
ate letters, what happened to you?  And nothing. This went on for 
weeks and weeks, until I went to a Pa rty, and th
e woman confidentially asked me to step aside, 
and told me that she was with them somewhere, 
and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were 
saying that they are stopping all my ma il and stu
ff it under their ma ttress. 
I left the place very 
quickly, I went home, looked under their ma ttress,
 and I found all the lett
ers, and confronted 
them with this, and I knew that I would have to 
move out, and that™s exactly when this happened, 
that I was invited and they sa
id, ﬁOh, you come  with us.ﬂ 
 

Q: So you went to Aspen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
72 
 
 
 
A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like goi
ng from a cave to paradise . Not only that it was 
beautiful and now, I had always been a mountain 
ma n, but the people, I just loved the people. 
That was way before Aspen was discovered and ma
de into the rich ma n™s Mecca. It wa s now a... 
it was a great deal of Europeans... Americans fr
om the 10th Mountain Di vi
sion that exist... that 
trained there during Wor l d Wa r II, and ma ny of its
 me mbers came back and established Aspen. It 

was just a ma rvelous group of people. Today, of 
course, they are all dead, but their name s are on 
streets, and the recreation centers 
and parks. And it just... it was a li
ttle bit weird for me  to return 
and see all my friends name s as street
 name s and park name s and all.   
 

Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about
 the place that was so appealing to you, and also 
how that changed your perceptionof the United St ates, if it did. 
 

A: What appealed to me  is, number one, up on 
eight thousand feet, you need each other. The 
winters ar e pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tour ists comi ng to the music festival . 

You needed other people™s help and you had to 
help others, too. There was just a cama raderie 
there, a very open attitude that 
appealed to me  a great deal. I wa
s still young, and the fact that I 
could get a job where I... my hours were not so re
gime nted, even then... there, I felt so free. The 
pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other areas of the United States.  There 

was so muc h color in the place. All kinds of 
people comi ng and going. It was just a... for a 
newcomer, it was a ma rvelous, ma rvelous introduc
tion to American life. There were people there 
who were truly the most mi ddle class, rigid fam
ily. There were people who were a very relaxed 
fa mily. All kinds, and they were all... they all got 
along so well, that was a great surprise to me . I 
also loved the fact that a great deal of the town, 
the eastern part , was still in such primitive stat e 

back then, that some  mi ner shacks still ha d cooking ut
ensils on the stove, just as they left them 
back at the turn of the century when the panic cam
e and ma ny of those miners went back to Italy 
and you... what is today Yugoslavia.
 So, there was a litt
le bit of the old. Not everything was 
concrete and glass, and well, even today the town
 has preserved a few buildings. I was very glad 
to see that not everyt hing is rebuilt.  
 

Q: When you formed friendships with people and ma
de contact with people there, did they... were 
they interested in your past, and where you™d co
me from and what had happened to you during 
the war?  Did anyone ask you about that, and 
did you feel compelled 
to talk about it? 
 

A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested.  Th
ese were the type of peopl
e, the locals and well, 
most people worked in businesses that catered 
to tourists. And it wasan asset if you had an 
accent, and if you look like some body who had an
 interesting past, because they... some times 
they hired me for a certain job just because 
I had a story. And yes, 
people were constantly 
questioning you about this, and I coul
dn™t care less, it... as a matter of
 fac t , I enjoyed this kind of 
fifteen mi nutes in the sun. And so, I m
ean, in this respect, I had no problem. 
 

Q: Did you find that people had 
an understanding of what had ha
ppened during the war, and the 
history of what had happened
 to the Jews in Europe?   
 

A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with
 whom I could really communicate about the 
war, and what happened in Europe, were the ones w
ho were in the European theater, and as I, as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
73 
 
 
I me ntioned before, ma ny of the so-called 10
th
 Mountain Division™s me mbers settled there, and I 
loved to talk to them, because they were very 
much involved in the liberation of some of the 
European countries, so they knew where I came from
. I just have to add one more thing to this, 
that interestingly, the reason I am
 so fond of Aspen, even toda y, b
ecause I believe that my life in 
America was shaped by that two and a half 
years I spent in Aspen. Almost  every major 
friendship, almost every major contact I had, af
ter I left Aspen, was based on some thing that 
happened to me  in Aspen. Al most every one of them
. I still am very close,
 and my closest friends 
today, I say, in the U.S. are those who were with
 me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.  
 
Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen? 

 

A: When I arrived there, imme diately, the next day, 
I started to wash dishes
 in a little café house 
called the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no 
more than five days or
 so, when a very nice 
looking Austrian gentlema n stopped by and, who 
looked, I reme mber, who looked exactly like 
the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, 
and said to me ... he watched me  washing dishes 
and he said, ﬁOh, I am so and so, I am a friend 
of Mr. Chabay.ﬂ And that was the gentlema n who 
brought me  to Aspen. He said, ﬁAnd I would like you to come  over and see my shop.ﬂ And he 

brought me  over to his shop, he had a nice je
welry and gift shop, and it wa s... he was a 
watchmaker and that was his ma in profession, but 
he also had a very, very nice place. And he 
asked me ... we conversed in German, since he 
wa s Austrian and I spoke much better German 

than English and he said, ﬁHow do you like my
 shop? ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhat a nice, nice, cute 
place.ﬂ He said, ﬁWould you like to work for me ?  
I can gi ve you this much,ﬂ which was a lot 
more than washing dishes. I said, ﬁBut how can 
you hire me ?  I don™t speak English.ﬂ He said, ﬁI 

didn™t ask you whether you speak E
nglish or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.ﬂ And he 
said... And I said, ﬁYes,ﬂ and he said, ﬁYou™re hi
red.ﬂ And that was the ki nd of attitude  that 
prevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of
 kidding. So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I 
started to work for him, this was in 1957, about
, I would say, July. And our friendship survived 
for forty-two years, because he™s the one, he and 
his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last 
year. Now, I work there until late fall... ear
ly fall, excuse me . A young ma n came  in around 
September, and by that time there weren™t t
oo ma ny people in Aspen, because it™s a seasonal 
place. At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street. At the end 

of Septembe r, people were leaving, the music 
fes tival was over, and the ski season came around 
in Decembe r. So everybody left, vacation, travel. 
A young man came in and started to talk to me . 

He said, ﬁI got a problem, my mother has a birt
hday and I have to get some thing for her.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁLook, that™s not... shouldn™t be a problem.ﬂ In my 
broken English I said th
at, and he looked at 
me and he immediately said, ﬁWell, where are 
you from? ﬂ  And of course, the whole story came 

about and I said, ﬁWell, why is it a problem to buy some thing for your mo ther?ﬂ He said, 

ﬁBecause she has everything.ﬂ And this is how
 I me t a then young ma n by the name  of Sheldon 
Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking famil
y. And on his twenty-first birthday he received 
a nightcl ub fr om his parents, called, The Lime lite. He just kept comi ng back and talking to me , 

and we just became really... friends. We™d occasi
onally go out at ni ght and he would bring his 
date and I would bring a date, a
nd had a very nice relationship. And then he came back later on, 
and he said, ﬁI have to leave my place, and there ar
e three apartments in the  nightclub. I just hate 
to leave the place unattended. Woul
d you mi nd moving into one of th
e apartments?  You can just 
stay there, and when I come  back we can just
 share apartments, and no problem.ﬂ Well, who™d... 
who would refuse a fr ee apartment? I moved in
to the Limelite apartment, and when he came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
74 
 
 
back in December to open it that year, he said
 to me , ﬁLook, I desperately need some body that I 
can trust, to be the cashier. How would you 
like to work for me ? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI double your 
salary.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, I would do that, but I 
am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly 
and I just... I just can™t leave.ﬂ He said, ﬁOh, this
 is America. We don™t ha
ve to worry about that. 
I™ll take care of that, I™ll talk to him.ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁYou know, Robert, here
, we don™t even show up 
when we leave, we just call and say, send my ch
e c k some whe r e.ﬂ He says, ﬁThere™s no loyalty 
here.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo?  You want me  to be loya
l to you.ﬂ The conversat
ion went on and on and on 
and I said, ﬁWell, I just cannot 
go to my friend, Kurt Breznits a
nd say, ‚I am leaving,™ because 
you double my salary.ﬂ But the truth is, I needed 
money very badly to go back to school. That 
was my aim,  that once I ma stered the language, I 
would go back to school. So, by the... I went to 
work next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt 
Breznits was laughing and said, ﬁRobert, you don™t 
have to have these problems in this country. Th
is is not Europe, and not
 only that, I would be 
delighted if you can ma ke twice as much money a s
 you ma de here. I can™t afford that salary.ﬂ 
But I said, ﬁBut we were such good friends.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁWell, from now on, as long as you™re in 
Aspen, every Friday night, we will ha ve dinner in
 my fa mily home.ﬂ So... and we did that, just 
every Friday, I usually work late 
Fridays, so they had an early di
nner, just so I can come . And we 
had dinner together and talked 
a great deal. And we saw each other ot her nights too, but that 
problem wa s solved, but I could never understand 
this distance that is between employees and 
employers. I™m still, even in my old days, as a hi
gh school teacher and all this, I would have been 
very hesitant to go and report to
 somebody that I found a better pla
ce and I want to leave. I know 
it™s silly, but it was just  pounded into me that 
you are loya l. And so I worked for the Lime lite, 
which became  a very well-known ni
ghtclub those days, with a lot of 
folk singers, as that was the 
time when the Kingston Trio a
nd all the others became fa mous
 and it was the... you know, the 
great time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all th
e rest, the... most of th
em came to this nightclub. 
And eventually, from cashier, I was pr omoted 
and eventually I ended up managing the place. 
And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, b
ecame  lucky, because his hated nightclub was 
sold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers 
who were singing there, three, four people, and 
they formed a group called ﬁThe Limeliters,ﬂ
 named after the club, became fa mous, and now 
they could buy the club fr om hi m. So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group, 

and... up until 1959, when I left. But I ma intained re
lations with one of the group, and his family. 
These are people who still very much around t
oday, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn 
Yarbrough, who was my  friend, 
is still producing CD™s. 
 

Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was 
really that you wanted to get in... to continue 
your education?  Wa s that– 
 

A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist pl ace, I 
knew that I would never ha
ve, probably, the money to 
go out on my own, because every year, buying a pl
ace, and setting up some  kind of a  business, 
was more and more expensive. As Aspen b
ecame more and more fashionable, everything 
became mor e expensive. Besides, I had no intere
st  in openi ng a business. I always thought of 

myself as an educator. I wanted to go back 
to school, and luckily, I got
 together with some  

adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska
. They said that in Alaska you can ma ke a lot 
of money and it™s fascinating, and it™
s beautiful. And I loved to travel
, so it was just a spur of a 
mome nt when I decided that at
 the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them 
to Alaska, and would try to ma ke mo ney, and th
en, eventually, that fall, I was going back to 
school in Fresno.

Q: Why Fresno?  Why Fresno? 

 

A: Why Fresno?  Yeah, people always ask me  this
 question, because I™m the most unlikely person to 
end up in a central California town of practic
ally no distinct
ion. Hundred, hundred ten degrees 
heat. Why Fresno?  Because they were the only ones
, back those days, who 
answered my letters... 
not giving me  a scholarship, because I had trouble 
getting my  records toge ther from Hungary. It 
was against the law, at that time
, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an 
opportunity to send it out with some body. And s
o, I just... a college had to accept me  on my 

word, and apparently they were afraid to do 
that. But Fresno said okay, you can come , spend a 
seme ster, we™ll find out how you function here, and 
then we will determine your status, based on 
that. And we cannot give you a scholarship, but 
we can assure you about the National Defense 
Scholarship, which was given to people who eventu
ally end up in education. And so I applied for 

that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me
, not scholarship. That™s what it was called 
back then. And I received that loan, and so 
eventually, after Alaska
, I ended... I ended up in 
Fresno. And of course, that was another eye ope
ne r, anothe r pi ece of Ame r ica that was very 
unknown to me . And it was a little 
bit of a crazy town, with... Fr
esno is the center of the 
Ar me nian population in America. And they were
... I hit it off with them extremely well, no 
problem, until they found out that I am writing my 
master thesis on Turko- American relations in 
1918-1920, and that was the time  when the Arme nian
s were persecuted terribly. And of course, 
no nation is all bad, no nation is al
l good. And of course, when they 
were reading a little bit of 
my thesis, they found out that I was very sympat
hetic to Kema l Ataturk. Of course, I condemned 
the me thod of getting rid of Ar me ni ans, but I was... I found some  goodness. So we had some  

little differences, but all in all, I liked the peopl
e in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign, 
foreign students, colleagues in th
e college and it was probably easie
r for me to navigate there, 
than if I had gone to a big instit
ution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I had a 
chance to talk to professors. It wa
s just a very relaxed atmos phere.  
 

Q: Were you feeling surprised that you™d been to 
several very different pl
aces in the country, with 
very different atmospheres. We re you surprised at
 how much variation there was in this country, 
that you had kind of come to
 expecting a certain, ma ybe– 
 

A: Unifor mity. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Well, I reported back, I reme mber to my relative
s, and parents, I said, ﬁT
his is not a country, this 
is a continent.ﬂ I said, ﬁD
on™t think in terms of a country, this is
 a continent.ﬂ It™s... it will be that 
way for a long, long time, and I thin
k it still is. When I travel, in
 spite of the uniformity that 
modern age brings, you can still see 
that it is... it™ll take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn™t, 
perhaps this is the way it should be, that we st
ill have areas that... like you can open your eyes 
and realize that you are not in Chic
ago, or not in New York.  And hope
 that they will keep it this 
way. 
 

Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your firs
t interview about what happened then, and how you... 
how you had gone from... it was after you got your 
Master™s degree, you went from Fresno to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
76 
 
 
teaching, in a special ed school, in Marin 
county, and you me ntioned you had a... you had 
wanted to go there because you had girlfriend in
 the area. And do you want to say anything more 
about that time, or do you want to go on to sayi
ng some thing about... I™d be interested in hearing 
how you me t Jan and what... kind of how your rela
tionshi p grew, and was built, and whether... 
and what she knew about your past  and what 
you talked... I™m getting ahead of myself. Why 
don™t– 
 

A: No, that™s okay. 

 

Q: ... you answer my first question first. 

 

A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area,
 for me  that was just in
credible.  I practically 
pinched myself every mo rning when I woke 
up and I saw the sun and looked around, and the 
scenery. I just couldn™t believe th
at I was that lucky. I just coul
dn™t find words to describe it to 
my parents, the beauty of the area and the very
 uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had 
for me . And still, it holds just 
a fascination. It™s almost like Eur
ope in the United States, when I 
walked the streets of San Francisco. I livedin Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I™m sorry. I 

lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is ju
st next door, which at 
that time  was affordable for a bachelor 
schoolteacher like myself. Today, of course, it 
would be impossible. And I had a nice little 
apartment in a duplex, overlooking what they ca
ll Raccoon St raight. And th
ese are small, little 
islands in the bay. The sailboats were going b
ack and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats, 
and it was just a very, very picturesque envir
onment. The type of people I associated with, 
ma inly through school, through my job, were very 
pleasant. Most of them were very young, and 
we did a lot of things together
. I also had plenty of opportunit
y, of course, to go on my  own. And 
those days, I just was a restless 
spirit. I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and 
see the streets... the lights of San 
Francisco, and just feel that th
ere is some thing going on in the 
city that I™m not part of, and I 
just have to hop into my car and 
go there. And I did that, and it 
was then fifteen mi nutes, twenty mi nutes, I was 
in the city, going around. And so then, I was 
walking around and I was happy, and I did a couple 
of things. And then I looked back and I saw 
the lights of Belvedere or Tibur
on or Sausalito, and I felt that there... some thing must be going 
on and I™m not part of it, so I hopped in my car 
and went back. So I was just restlessly looking 
for that unknown beauty which really was just
 around me , all over. And I loved to hike up on 
Mount Tamalpais. Mill Valley, a
ll those communities were very unique to me , and I thought I 
would live my life here, probably forever. 
 

Q: What year was it? What y
ear was it when you arrived? 
 

A: 1961. And, as I me ntioned previously, the only j
ob I could get here was... teaching mentally 
retarded students, but I didn™t mi nd, because I thought
 of the old Hungarian 
proverb that said for 
any... for some thing that you like, you would ev
en let people chop wood on your back, and I 
strongly believe in this. And so, 
I just... I didn™t really consider
 teaching these children a great 
deal different  than teaching regular children. As a 
matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain 
sense, it was even easier because they were so
 loyal and devoted to you. Naturally, there were 
some  problems with emotionally disturbed kids
, who were in this gr
oup, too. But basically, it 
was easy, because of their love and devotion. And I st
ayed in it for ten years,
 and after ten years, 
I honestly said to myself, I™m burned out, I have
 nothing more to give, and this is when I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
77 
 
 
returned to regulating... teaching so-called normal 
children, if there is such thing. And my wife, 
yeah, I me t my wife at a teacher™s meeting, and our
 superiors, our admi nistrators, were a rather 
strange bunch of people, who had some ti me s ve
ry unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to 
do with education, such as we s
hould have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never 
have dusty shoes. And saying this to people w
ho had to go out in the playground almost every 
hour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized 
the way we dressed or what we said, or we 
looked, and they didn™t much do it to me , but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man 

on the faculty of the county, but ma inly to wome
n. And... so I me t my wi fe and at that time she 
was ma rried with three children. And she struck 
me  as a kind of a person who doesn™t really 
want others to know mu ch about her. And I f
ound out later there was 
a reason for that. Then– 
and we just discussed things, a
nd I in my mi nd said, ﬁOh, this la
dy™s quite cold.ﬂ That was my 
first impression. And never bothered really much. 
But, our path crossed at these meetings, and 
eventually, she was writing some  kind of a public
ation for mentally retarded teachers, and she 
called me  up, and... 
 

Q: Mentally retarded teachers, or st udent s?  

 

A: I™m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. 
And she called me up and she wanted my advice in 
some thing, which I still ma intain, even up t
oday, it was just a device to strike of...

Q: This is tape two, side A, of 
an interview with Robert Holczer. 
 

A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I wa s not really very impressed, because she was not very warm. 
And then the relationship changed after her phone 
call, when she asked for some  help, because I 
thought if a woman is really cold
 and reserved, she wouldn™t call 
me  and ask for help. And so I 
called her back and we started to chat, and from
 there on, occasionally, we  called each other. But 
we never talked about personal things, and so, 
the whole thing kind of 
petered out. And then, 
later, a year  or two years later, 
I was invited to a party, and to one
 of our colleagues, and he said, 

ﬁOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She is divorced, and she looks good.ﬂ And according to... 

excuse me ... according to Jan, I said, ﬁ Wow,ﬂ whic
h I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway, 
this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered 
it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to 
see her. So they invited her and kind of ma tched 
us together one evening, and we hit it off just 
right. And from there on, I began to see her more of
ten, and eventually, we just decided that this 
was a pretty serious relationship. 
But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor , and I just was 
not going to get ma rried without giving it some  
thought. So, I did what my previous girlfriend 
did, and signed up for one year to go and teach 
for the Army in Germany. And I arrived there, 
and I spent a year in Germany, and t hat year conv
inced me  that yes, that she would be the right 
person for me, so I came home . And we got ma rri
ed on Mount Tama lpais, on the top of Mount 
Tamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike ar
ound, and the mountain we both saw every day, 

comi ng and going to school.

Q: How old we re her children at that point? 
 

A: Five, six and eight. 

 

Q: Did they ask you about your e
xperiences during the war at some  
point, or did you tell... did they 
know anything about 
your history?   
 

A: Interestingly, they were more interest ed the
n, than they are now. As little children, they kept 
asking me  a lot, and these days, as adults, if we
 meet, ma ybe they fear they knew... they heard 
everything. But I am surprised that 
my sons, who are writing all the 
time, just as a pastime, never 
really ask any questions. And they are around mo
vies concerning the Holocaust and... back those 
days. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told th
em quite a bit, and it was not really that much 
about the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn™
t want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it 
was ma inly just life, what was life when I grew 
up and what I... the thi
ngs I did, and they were 
fascinated by my accent, and they begged us to ha
ve another child, so he  or she could have an 
accent. They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my 

mi stakes that I made, because sometimes they 
were really funny. And in
advertently, I did say 
certain things that just sounded very stra
nge, and still are a sa
ying in the family. 
 

Q: Suchas? 

 

A: Pardon me ?  Such as, I... for a long time , I thought
 that fungus is really fangus, and so everybody 
called fungus a fangus. Once I told them some thing 
about a lawyer, and I... instead of lawyer, I 
kept saying liar. And they couldn™
t understand, and in the end they
 said, the difference is of no... 
when I learn, I said, ﬁGod, there is no difference,
 lawyers, liars, what™s
 the difference? ﬂ And so 
there were ma ny cute episodes. Drift and draft,
 I reme mber I had troub
le distinguishing that. 
ﬁClose the... close the door, because there is a 
drift.ﬂ And so ever sinc
e, everybody called it dr ift 
and not draft. 
 

Q: What about Jan?  Did you talk 
with Jan about your much... in the early times of your getting to 
know each other, about your experiences during th
e Holocaust, and about just the Holocaust in 

general?  
 

A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wa
nted to know everything and I told her everything. 
And she read a great deal. And, as a ma tter of fa
c t , she is my police woman, because she doesn™t 
allow me  to watch anything concerning the Holocau
st on television, because 
she says I have such 
nightma res that she doesn™t want to wake me  
up and it just... too much trouble. But I was amazed 
that after we got ma rried
, how much time she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books 
on Jewish history, and then, of course, going in
to her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish 
cookbooks and she knows more about Jewish co
oking and holidays, and... so today when 
some body a sk me  about some  Jewish custom or holid
ay or some thing, I always refer them to her, 

because she knows a lot more about it than I do. I 
just, because of my indifference to religion, I 
just never really give it too much thought, of
 learning much a bout holidays and the background, 
but she did. And of course, there was never a
ny question about conversio
n, anything like this, 
because I myself, I 
was not practicing.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

Q: How... was her family accepting of you? 
 

A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time  we got
 ma rried, the person who probably wouldn™t have 
liked me , because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was a very 

tolerant person, but she was dea
d, too, by the time we got ma rri
ed. So, the only relatives around 
that she had, was her brothe
r and her sister, who are 20
th
-Century human beings, and they are 
very, very tolerant, and ve
ry progressive people.  
 

Q: Okay, so you stayed in the Ba
y Area until 1974, is that right? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. What did you think of... were you awar
e of what was going on with the... with the 
Summer of Love, and the Free Speech Moveme nt
 and all that stuff 
that was happening in 
Berkeley, and San Francisc
o in the late sixties? 
 

A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Ar
ea, and even before that, as soon as I could 
understand and speak some  English, I became involve
d in the social and political scene very 
much. For example, I reme mber when I... even befo
re I settled in the Bay Area, I would come  up 
for the weekend and would go down, just by myself
, to North Beach, in San Francisco, to the 
beatnik coffeehouses, and just li
sten, or converse some ti me s with
 people. I really enjoyed the 
beatnik era. I liked those people, 
they were very introspective a
nd intelligent. There was kind of 
a subdued, refined attitude about them that I 
appreciated. Occasionally, when some body played 
the piano, they were sipping the coffee and 
philosophizing, just a gr
eat time , I think, for 
literature, poetry reading. They we
re all part of the scene. That  trul y was an interesting chapter in 

my life, going to North Beach. Then, later on, of c
ourse, after we were ma
rried, after I came back 
from Europe, from my one-year stint with the 
Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything 
started, especially the Vietnam Wa r flared up. An
d our fa mily was very much involved in that. 
We were going over to the city, and I reme mber 
making big signs. My wife joined the Another 
Mother for Peace move ment. We were demonstrat
ing, and there was a ve ry cute episode that 
happened to us. She usually sewed a lot for hers
elf and for the children, and bought a very nice, 
flowery ma terial to ma ke a dress. And we went 
to a big demonstration over in Berkeley, and had 

to ma ke our own signs. And we were getting th
e signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down 
on our youngest son, Kevin™s sign, and 
what did we see?  A beautiful 
flower, of some textile, and 
if we looked at it, then we  realized it was he
r dress ma terial that she had bought. He was so 
fascinated by the pattern, and he needed 
flowers, because that was the theme of the 

demonstration, you had to have flowers on your si
gns, that he didn™t think twice, and he was 

cutting out the flowers from... what... we didn™t k
now what to do about it, and then we decided 
just to talk to him, that this was not really 
the proper thing to do, but he didn™t get punished. So 
that was Vietnam. My sister-i
n-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that 
she fears that he should not run again. And interes
tingly, about three days later, he came  out and 
he announced that he would not run. So that... we 
felt that the fa mily can take some  credit for 
that decision. But, we, we tried to have our ch
ildren go and learn a lot about the times where we 
lived in, because we realized that they were ve
ry exciting times, very unique times. And perhaps, 
I always thought later on in thei
r lives, life will be much duller 
than it was back then. We also 
lived, by that  time, in Inverness, in an area that 
was in the center of all these cults, and rock 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
80 
 
 
bands and so the kids we re exposed to all thes
e people and spent some times days, just listening 
to thei r music, up in the hills. It had advantages
, it had di sadvantages. The disadvant age in this 
respect was that, no ma tter what 
parents would say to their childr
en, they always had a place to 
go and because these rock groups had open house,
 you could help yourself at the fridge, or 
whatever, eating, or no ma tter how young you were, you 
were also welcome to dip into the pot 
and smoke it. And so it was in a... in the sense, 
difficult. And ma ny of our children in the area, 
were runawa ys. They would occasionally run 
away because that was just  the styl e.  
 

Q: During that time , did you... were you aware of
 how Americans in general thought about the 
Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some  of th
e stereotypes that were attached to them? And 
did you think of yourself as a 
Holocaust survivor, and how we
re you... how were you relating to 
the culture at large, in term
s of that kind of identity? 
 

A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising questi
on, because I never really 
thought about it, but as 
you were asking me , I realize I didn
™t really think much about my
self any more, as a Holocaust 
survivor. I just thought much as a member of the  
scene, so to speak. I was more involved in what 

is happening in America, and thought more about 
it day by day, than to think too much, to give 
too much thought about the past. So, in this 
respect, it was good, because one should not 
constantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it
 was a good thing for me , in this respect. And you 
know, I was part of the whole story then, and, rath
er, an American fighting to end the wa r, and 
bring justice to people who were oppressed. 
 

Q: But you did have nightma res a
bout the past, you me ntioned that. 
 

A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by 
watching some  television story, or reading 
some thing in the newspaper. Otherwise, they 
we re going away, they were becomi ng distant. 
 

Q: What about when you lived in Germany and 
you™re... you™re there in this nation that had 
perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably 
were much more aware of the history there, 
than your acquaintances had been when you lived 
in the States. Wa s it a bigger issue that The 
Holocaust?  Was it more of a... did it have more 
of a place in your life and did you talk about it 
with people? 
 

A: The... now, this is a very complex story. Wh
en we lived in Germany, whi c h was from 1974 to 
1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Ge rmany and East Germany, the 

Holocaust wa s not a big problem, ma inly becaus
e the West Germans were bringing it into the 

open. It was not some thing hushed up under the rug. Th
ere were discussions a
bout it in schools. I 
spoke about it to high school students, ma inl
y. The whole... the whole problem with the 

Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, 
really started after th
e Unification. Now, I 
must also say that there weren™
t too ma ny peopl e who were alive in Wor l d Wa r II, by this time . 

Because I wa s fifteen when the war ended, and 
I am seventy now, almost . And so, most people 
are dead, who were in World Wa r II. Now of cour
se, it doesn™t mean that Fa scism as such, is 
dead, or was even... was dead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that 

it was the proper thing to do, Iresponded, and some ti me s when 
I looked at the person, and I 
realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was 
no reason to say anything. It would have been 
totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it 
wouldn™t have ma de any difference. I rather 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
81 
 
 
concentrated on talking to people of the mi
ddle and the younger generation. And I found that 
intellectually, at least,
 they understood what was the Holocau
st. They were very ashame d and 
sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, 
with young people especially. 
I felt that they were 
progressive enough. The younger German generation 
amazed me, because I think they are very 
progressive, and I think they see history in th
e right light. How... all this changed after the 
unification, because you had now Eastern Germa
ny joining. A country that was never taught 
proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, onl
y We st Germans were responsible for the 
Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East
 Germany, were in We st  Germany. So, those 
people had no background, and they had... they were not
 prepared for this historical fact and they 
denied it. And this is why the skinhead m
ove me nt and all the neo-
Fascist organizations, 
basically, come from, Ea st Germany, even today. 
Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and 
anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very
 bad economic conditions and the fact that 
unification didn™t bring imme
diate remedies to all their problem
s. So they had to again go back 
and blame the old scapegoat, the 
Jews, in spite of the fact that
 there aren™t too ma ny. So, since 
they couldn™t attack ma ny who are living 
among them, they went back to the past. 
 
Q: You were living in Frankfurt at the time  th
at the Wall... that the Berlin Wa ll came  down? 
 

A: Mm-h m.  

 

Q: Do you... Did you foresee any of this?  Did you, at 
the time... what were your emotions at the 
time, and your thoughts at the time that the Wall
 came down and you were seeing the... that there 
was this... unification was going to be happening? 
 

A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same , 
that we lived truly in a 
moment of history that 
is... has just very, very few co
mpanions. That it was some thing extraordinary. And now, just a 
couple of years before, nobody would have thought 
that in our lifetime, some thing like this will 
happen. But of course, after the Soviet regime  collaps
ed, then, then, it was in
evitabl e. It  still, it 
was a surprise, and it was naturally some thing that
 will always be in my mi nd, because just a few 
weeks before, my granddaughter, who was about fi
fteen at that time , came  to Europe and we 
went to the Wall in Berlin, and we had pictures 
of her just standing by, and I was telling her that 
you can bring back your children here, probably, 
and ma ybe e ven your grandchildren one day, 
and the Wa ll will still be here. And so, no, 
nobody anticipated such a 
rapi d disintegration. 
 

Q: Did your... have you talked to your grandchildren 
about... have they been interested in a... in 
your experiences during the Holocau
st, or ask you questions about– 
 

A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who is twenty
-four... I™m sorry, twenty-f
our? No, no, twenty-two, I 
talk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holoca
ust. And we usually go t
ogether to movies, not 
necessarily related to the Holocaust but some time s  
do, like, we  saw, ﬁLife is Beautifulﬂ together, 
and I make a point to take her to movies th
at deal with history... 
modern history, or the 
Holocaust, so we can talk about it. I want 
her to know everything. The, the... I have two 
grandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust Mu
seum. And they are at th
e... they were at the 
age, they went through too fast for my taste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will 

slow down. And the other... grandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say 

anything.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
82 
 
 
 
Q: So, when you were in Germany, you were 
teaching... were you teaching American students? 
 

A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American hi
gh school, where The American Ar my and the 
American diplomat™s kids would go. Just like
 any other high school. We  had a... that was a 
school district, just like an 
American school district. It 
was funded by the same  way, a nd 
operated the same  way a nd everything was the 
same , only the scene was Fr ankfurt, Germany. 
 

Q: Did you know... did you have other Jewish friend
s in Germany at the time who had been through 
the Holocaust? 
 

A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some German 
fri e nds and we talked about the Holocaust, and 
they knew about me , but it... we never really ma de 
it into a big deal, and I 
never really wanted to 

ma ke it a big deal, I didn™t want them to think th
at I solely exist and ma intain the fr iendship to 
kind of pound in the subject. They knew about me , they knew about my life, and we discussed it 

in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they 
were genuinely interest
ed and sorry for what 
happened. But, other than that, no, no, I did not 
have any other– occasionally, my high school 
teacher friend, the German couple, they invite
d me  to their schools, to talk. And Germans 

amazed me because, in our house, for example, 
there was a lady who was a farmer™s daughter, 
and she was in a... kind of a mi d-level ma nageri
al job with a pharmaceutical company and she 
had constantly friends from Israel
, and she was not Jewish. I had 
another... I have another very 
old friend in Germany, I me t back 
in the early 1960™s, and we have been friends ever since, and 
she has friends constantly visiting her from Isr
ael. She™s also not Jewish. So, there™s a lot of 
contact between Israel and Germany, and well, I d
on™t know whether this is 
a result of a... of a 
bad conscience or some thing, but certainly you 
cannot hold some body who was not even alive at 
that time responsible for anything that happened. 
No, that would be unreasonable. But it™s not... 
today, it™s not a big issue. It is 
a sad fact of history, 
especially in the western part of Germany. 
 

Q: Did you have thoughts at that tim
e, of where you wanted to stay, 
whether you wanted to stay in 
Germany and settle there, and ma ke your home 
there, or did you picture comi ng back to the 
United States at some  point?   
 

A: Oh, I could have stayed in 
Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my na me , which is a German 
name  and the fact that I was, for a few month, 
a German citizen, in World War II. And that was 
just for a few months, so I didn™t include in any 
citizenship, just by a mi stake and because of the 
strange happenings of the times. They classified
 me  as Ger man in Hungary, and temporarily we 
were considered Germans, and of course the wh
ole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few 

month when they found out who we were. But that 
little episode and my na
me , and the fact that 
the reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides be
ing Jewish, they discov
ered that one of my 
great-grandparents was born in what is called Su
detenland, which was a part of Germa n speaking 
Czechoslovakia, which was at that time, the 
Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all 
connects together, and it all added up to some
 very tragic events, because  we were not 
considered Hungarians, and my grandfather wa
s deported to Auschwitz, not because he was 

Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreig
ner. He could not prove that his gr andfather was 
a Hungarian, which was not true . But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten 

German citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, 
a great deal of money that way, because of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
83 
 
 
what happened to my fa mily in Wor l d Wa r II, 
and all this, but I neve
r had, for a second, a 
thought. I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, a nd taking German citizenship? 
There are so ma ny reasons why I shouldn™t have 
done this, right?  Numbe r  one is an emotional 
thing, a rational thing to... that w
ould be a little bit too much for me
 to bear. Second is that I have 
an American fa mily, and my wife was ready to 
re turn to the United St
ates. There no way would 
she have stayed in Europe with me . So, I knew 
that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it 
lasted.

Tape 9, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with
 Robert Holczer. Do you wa
nt to say anything else 
about Germany before we go on? 
 

A: I just want to say that I know that, for the pur
pose of the interview, you™
re interested in anti-
Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I 
must say that the country where I ran into the 

most anti-Semitic and Fascist rema rks, and... is 
Austria. And I was amazed that the... so ma ny 
years after the war, I don™t see a 
lot of changes. That here is 
a country that, unlike Germany, was  
considered a victim of Fascism, which of c
ourse, it was not, and played this role very 
successfully. And today, it is just
 terrible. It™s, the right wing 
elements are all over it. And you 
can go to any pub and just wait unti
l they have a few drinks, and 
there will be some  talk about 
the good old days. So, no, I thought Germany de alt 
with the problem mu ch, much be tter than 
Austria.  
 

Q: So you came to the U.S. in 1993, you return
ed. Did you come  straight to Kentucky? 
 

A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Fra
nkfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And by that 
time, we had a little home, because my brother 
and sister-in- law, who own Briarbrook Farm, had 
called us two years before, and asked us if we
 would like to buy a home here for a very, very 
little money, and that sounded 
just like a good investme nt. My 
wife, of course, imme diately 
knew it was going to be our home. I just considered
 ma ybe just an investme nt. We  bought it, and 
then slowly, she worked on me  to retire here. Beca
use I had no intention to come  here. I wanted 
to be near a big city and I loved 
California. And she insist ed that 
she did not want to go back to 
California, even though she lived all her American
 life there, and so she won. We ll, she followed 
me  to Europe for twenty years, and I thought it 
is proper to honor her wi
shes and whatever they 
were, but basically, she wanted to 
be close to her sister and vice-
versa, so we came here, and at 
least we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter
 in Virginia and to our son and 
her... and his fa mily in Nashville. So, th
at was an... also another consideration.  
 

Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about Ke
ntucky in general? Did you consider it to be 
kind of a backwards place, or did you ha
ve... had you heard any stereotypes about it? 
 

A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every su
mme r  when... while we were in Europe, every second 
summer or so, we would come  back and stop he
re, too, for a few days. And so I could... I was 
always very defiant when it came to this place, I 
just... I never really opened my eyes as to what 
is here, rather would sulk so... not
 in a very obvious way, but call it 
an inside sulker. That™s what 
I was, sitting on the couch during the day, and occas
ionally complaining that there is really not 
much to do here. And this was going on, I was... I 
never really came here with great enthusiasm. 
As I put it to my wife, an area 
that doesn™t even have sidewalk
s in town, to walk around, what 
am I going to do there? And also the fences bot
hered me , that you can™t go anywhere, everything 
is fenced in. And how can you take your mountai
n bike and, and bike somewhere?  You run into 
a fence within mi nutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew that she 

was very insistent, and the last time we were vi
siting here, I think it was 
in ™91, that was shortly 
after we bought that little house... people were still
 living in it, the partners
 of the farm, and I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
85 
 
 
walking around, and all of a sudden, the... my pa
st caught up with me , be cause I spent a great 
deal, as a young kid, out in nature, 
and I loved the smells and the... 
I loved the sight of a tree, the 
smell of the grass. And all of asudden, I began to smell and look at 
the very things that were so 
dear to me  when I was little and I was constantly
 hiking with my friends. And I realized that this 
is not a ba d place, and be sides, it was so peaceful
. At night there was no noise. And so I came  
back and the whole fa mily was around because 
they were... we were celebr ating our wedding 
anniversary. And I said, ﬁI want
 to say some thing to you.ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁI just ma de up my mi nd, I can 
live here very well.ﬂ And that wa
s the end. All my sulking went aw
ay, all my reservations went 
away. I knew I was not going to come  to the mi ddl
e of New York City. I knew that there is not 
going to be any half-timbered houses when I walk 
into Paris. But I thought that I can ma ke the 
best of it, and that I can live here. 
 

Q: Did you have concerns cultura
lly, what it would be like? 
 

A: Yes, that was my main concern. 
I knew that this is a beautiful  st
ate and if I drive an hour from 
here, I can start hiking and it is 
really an... an open range, but cultu
rally, I had reservations and I 
still have reservations. I feel a 
little... I would have really felt mu
ch worse, perhaps twenty, thirty 
years ago, but at the time when television brings
 you, especially the educ
ational channel and the 
history channel and Discovery a
nd there are so many channels now that you can get, that 
brings... they bring a lot of good knowledgeable stuff, and this 
is one thing. Second, of course, 
the internet  connects you with the world. So, one 
is not so isol ated any more. Still, I am still 

yearning to go to a town where 
the streets are crowded. I don™t wa
nt to live on a crowded street 
all the time , but some times, and I want to go to a 
sidewalk café, and I want to eat some  different 
food that doesn™t taste the same , a
nd just converse with people. I f
eel that there is
, right now in 
this country, there is great su
spicion. You just can™t walk up 
to people and start talking. And 
Kentucky is even better off in th
is respect than any other state, 
probably, or most other states. It 
just... there is always that suspicion in a person™
s mi nd, based on all the stor
ies that we hear day 
by day by day by day, of violence. Violence really
 kind of poisoned the atmosphere in this 
country a great deal, and I™m very sensitive to that
. So, I would love to just go to a park and sit 
on a bench some times, and just talk to strangers
, as I used to when I was younger. But that™s 
impossible. We don™t go to the park to begin 
with, because there are no... not many pa rks, and 
there aren™t... not too ma ny people, if you find a pa
rk. And when it gets dark, of course, you clear 
out, and you just don™t have that kind of a life, 
that vibrant life that 
you find still in European 
cities. 
 

Q: Do you... Have you formed relationships with peopl
e just in the community in Paris?  Neighbors, 
do you spend time in, in that town? 
 

A: Well, with neighbors, I just don™t have that 
much with... in common. On
e neighbor next to our 
far m is a hog far mer, and I don™t know anything a
bout hogs and he doesn™t seem to be interested 
in ma ny other things. And the others are way dow
n. I go to Paris to take care of some business 
that is necessary, post office or shopping, and th
is and that. And my hobbies... one of my hobbies 
is antiques, so I know the people 
who are in the antique
 business in Paris, and I can go in and 
spend some time and talk to them. But I do 
not have a close friend. Now my... however, my 
association with the so-called 
ma ster gardeners association in
 Lexington brought me together 
with people. I do volunteer work for the arboretum in season, every week, and so... one day, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
86 
 
 
these are the people, usua lly, that I am the cl
osest to, because we have a common interest, 
gardening. We spend time  together, we have me e
tings. And after the season is over, we continue 
seeing each other. So, yes, but since I came bac
k... and that has also some thing to do, of course, 
with my age , too... I have not found he
re, anyone that I can call a friend.  
 

Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourself
, or have they reached out to you in any 
way?  Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town? 
 

A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are 
interested my accent, and I cannot really say that 
they are suspicious or they reject me . One ma
n, a young ma n told me  this last year. Said, ﬁYou 
know, you are much better off than I.ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁYou open your mout h, and everybody says, 
‚Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?™ﬂ 
And he said, ﬁI open my mouth and they say, 
‚Hey, you are not from here, are you?™ And you know
 what they mean,ﬂ he says, ﬁthat I™m a 
damn Yankee.ﬂ And I don™t know about this, but a
ll I can say is that 
nobody has ever reacted 
negatively toward my a ccent. I see that sometimes
 people smile when I talk to them, and  I know 
why they do it and I consider it a 
friendly gesture. And that™s about
 it. The only people I™m really 
ma d at, the ones who listen to me  for awhile an
d say, ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ Because I know that they 
are putting me  on. That – if schoolchildren coul
d understand me , they could, too. But... and 
another thing that, of course i
rritates me , when– my hearing is 
not that good any more, and this 
has nothing to do with accent and all this, it™s just
 that some  people are ve ry intolerant , and if 
you ask, you know, ﬁ Will you please repeat it?ﬂ They ju
st say, ﬁForget it.ﬂ And the word forget it 
really irritates me . But that has nothing to do 
with accent and being foreign born.  Otherwise, I 
find that people are muc h friendlier, even with
 my reservations about being suspicious, much 
fr iendlier than they were in some
 other states that I™ve travelled. 
 

Q: Did you say awhile... ma ybe the first interview 
we did, at that time were you working with the 
Historical Society in Paris,
 or with the museum?  Do you still do that at all, or– 
 

A: No, I don™t do it any more, and frankly, I can™t
 even come  up with a good reason why. Perhaps 
it™s just that I get very busy at home, and the
... some how, the fa miliar f
aces that I knew, ma ny of 

them left and I... it™s very difficult, I think, afte
r a certain age, to ma ke friends and to build kind 
of a circle around yourself. And also when I first 
joined, the Historical Society was a lot more 
vital than it is now. I thin
k it just settled into a ro
utine life, and it just... I 
wa s just not interested 
any more. The museum was established, it™s runn
ing smoothly. I don™t think they really need me  
there any more. So I rather c
oncentrate on the Master
 Gardener™s Association, where I can do 
some thing, actually work. I am always much happ
ier when I can do physical work, than when I 
just sit around and talk about what to do.  
 

Q: Have you taken a particular inte
rest in Kentucky history since 
you™ve been here, or in learning 
about that?  
 

A: I... well, not strictly speaking 
Kentucky history, but I did take my 
first class, last year, in the 
history of Cincinnati. Cincinnati
 fascinated me from the very beginning, because when I saw it, I 
said, this is the closest thing, 
around here, to a real city. The ot
hers seem like v
illages, all of 
them. I can™t think of any place in Kentucky, that
 to me , looks like an ur ban environment. And 

the... most of the places are, you know, just 
built very quickly and the original downtown... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
87 
 
 
unfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know 
it, and what is left of it is just struggling. 
Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in
 Cincinnati, and Cincinnati
™s history, that I took 
a class, a whole week Elder Hostel 
class. I like to take classes w
ith Elder Hostel, and it™s usually 
a hands-on class, but this time I ma de an ex
ception, ‚cause I wanted to know the history, 

background, and more about the area. And it was 
not just Cincinnati, it
 was northern Kentucky, 
too. It was very good. So I™m hoping to do some  mo
re. And of course, here and there I read a 
book about Kentucky. I take some  
authors who are local and look 
into their works, and David 
Dick lives in the area, and his books... so, I am
. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky 
history, I leave this to people who 
are natives. I just have a kind of 
a... really a surf
ace interest in 
just the basics. 
 

Q: Do you feel that you can stay here and live here a
nd be at home  here for the rest of your life?  Is 
that some thing you think about? 
 

A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That™s 
it. This is my last station. I am here for good, and 
naturally, this is not a bad place to be, and ev
en though I mi ght... I coul d think of some other 
places where I would rather live, but I am he
re now, and I ma ke the best of it. So...  
 

Q: It seems like you could, if you look back on... 
on your whole life and where you came from and 
what your experiences have been, that you could sa
y to yourself that this was almost the last... 
last pl ace that you would have landed. You think? 
 

A: Yes. I wouldn™t have chosen it, back thirty or 
forty years ago, no way. Because at that time I still 
was more, some how I fe lt that I... that there was still a great deal to disc
over. And I know that, 
now that I reached the age, and c
onsidering the fact that I have h
eart problems, that I can™t just 
jump around any more. And even though I would love
 to visit some  other corners of the world, 
and our country, I have to take it easy, and this is
 basically a very good point to be. I really like 
to explor e more of the eastern 
part of the United St ates. That™s
 a very good place to be, and the 
fact that we lead here, otherw
ise in kind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and 
sister-in-law, that here... we ha
ve been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never 
had a conflict, not even a mi nor one. We  eat our
 meals together quite a bit. We  go, usually 
together to the theater or a part
y or some thing. We do a lot of thi
ngs together. We  are... they are 
our companions, and we are theirs. And so I... cons
idering all this, I am ve
ry happy, and at peace.  
 
Q: Have you encountered any anti-Semitism 
since you™ve been here to Kentucky? 
 

A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. 
I think there are so ma ny... s o few Jews here. Of 
course, that doesn™t mean anythi
ng, there are very few Jews left 
in Poland, and there™s still anti-
Se mitism, but no. 
 

Q: And then you me ntioned that you talk...  have been talking with school groups. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Will you say some thing about what that experience is like? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
88 
 
 
A: Oh that, that is... I do this w
ith great pleasure, becau
se I know that... in this area, there are very 
few people, probably, who experienced the Holocau
st, and even know what it is. And so, one 
schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always invites me , about two, 
three times a year. And last time, it was a closed ci
rcuit televi sion that they
 put me  on, with some 
other classes around Kentucky. And... but most of th
e time , I just talk to her classes... her 
combined classes or some other teachers bring in
 classes, and these are usually ki ds, thirteen, 
fourteen years old, and I like to ta
lk to them, because that™s how old I was when the real disast er 
hit me . And so I can kind of get down to their 
level of understanding and explain certain things 
to them. And I find that they are very receptiv
e, very receptive. So, I consider it a mi ssion. 
 

Q: Are these students... is th
is Bourbon county schools? 
 

A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I™ve never b
een to the Paris school system, but it™s Bourbon 
county, which is, just  basically, geographically speak
ing, it™s also in the city, they just split, I 
don™t know why. And so I talk to
 the Bourbon county schools. I s
poke to the high school last 
year, but ma inly it™s the mi ddle school. 
 

Q: Do you find that the students are they all fa
miliar with the terminology, 
the term Holocaust? Do 
they know... do they have a basic grasp of what happened? 
 

A: The mi ddle school students, because of the teach
er™s eagerness to clarify everythi ng, are much 
better informed than the high school student s. I 
was amazed. I went to the high school, I... once I 
went to Berea and talked to the 
Berea class, and that was the worst. They were just  unint erested, 
sleepy people with a professor who, hims elf, put 
me  asleep. I just couldn™t blame the students, by 
that time, they were so turned off, that no ma
tter what I did, I could ha
ve stripped nude, and it 
wouldn™t have ma de mu ch of a diffe rence in that
 class. But the mi ddle-
school kids, the junior 
high, they are just great to talk to. One girl... ju
st yesterday, I was speakin
g to a class, and one 
little girl stayed behind, and I usually spend about 
an hour and a half with them. I speak to them 
for awhile and then let them ask que stions. Andone little girl was just 
stay... just stood behind 
and she was waiting for me , wa
iting for me , whe n after everybody left, she came up, and she 
hugged me , and she kissed me , and s he said, ﬁThis is
 all... for all the mi ssed loves and kisses that 
you could not get from your pare
nts during those years.ﬂ I thought  that was just charmi ng. And 
she just turned around and left. It was... ther
e was no other, you know, 
second thought about it. 
And so, it was just very, very beautiful.  
 

Q: Have you not...  I mean, well, you mentioned you hadn™t expe rienced anti-Semitism, have you 
experienced anybody kind of asking you why 
don™t you go to church, or you know, kind of 
asking you what church do you go to, or ju
st expecting you to be Christian? 
 

A: Yeah, I... that come s around a li
ttle bit more often, when the people just cannot comprehend that, 
how can anybody who doesn™t steal, doesn™t chea
t, doesn™t embezzle, has been ma rried for 
thirty-three years, why am I not a 
church goer? And that is what 
I have to explain many times to 
people. Not only that, when I say I™m a non-believer
, of course, I think I™m out of their favors. 
And... but I try to ma ke a point there, too, that one
 does not have to go to church and belong to a 
religion, to lead a decent life. And I say that
. I look around and see how many people who go to 
church are in the news, beating their wives a
nd embezzling money from the school™s treasury, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
89 
 
 
from the county treasury or using highway funds
 for their own purposes. You don™t have to go. 
You can set your own rules. So, I do more 
argument about that th
an anything else.  
 
Q: Do you tell them that you™re... that you™re Jewi
sh and that that™s pa
rt of the reason why? 
 

A: Well, I tell them always. I™m not ma
king any ________________. I am... I always say, I™m 
Jewish, but I am not a Jew... I am a J e w, but I™m not Jewish. And of course, first, nobody 

understands what I™m talking about. And I say, ﬁEt
hnically speaking, I am a Jew. I come  from a 
ethnic group called the Se mites and one of the 
subgroups are Jews.ﬂ I said, ﬁNow these people 
have been mixed... intermingling with other people
 for over a thousand years, and therefore there 
is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there™
s no such thing as a pure anything any mo re, since 
history mi xed us up quite successfully. But, when
 it come s to religion,ﬂ I said, ﬁeven though I am 
a Jew, my re ligion is not Jewish. I have no religi
on.ﬂ I said, ﬁI am not... I do not belong to any 
organized religion.ﬂ So eventually Ithink they understand what I me an. 
 

Q: Do you ever get any responses to 
that?  People getting in
to a conversation, or 
is that just kind of 
heads nodding, and then– 
 

A: Well, of course there are always those who f
eel that they can perhaps sway me  over. And I 
always say, ﬁLook, I™m seventy years old, and 
you have no idea how ma
ny people tried, and you 
are just wasting your time,ﬂ I said. And so eventua
lly, they see that they are. So they give up and 
many of them still trust me and keeps talking to
 me , and there are those who kind of shy away, 
because I mi ght, you know, be who knows, the dev
il, or... you never know what they think of 
you if you say I™m a non-believer.  
 

Q: Oh, we™re about to end. 
 
End of Tape 9, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

Tape 10, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an 
interview with Robert Holczer. Okay, do you have any 
contact with other Holocaust survivors in 
Kentucky, or have you... do you know anything about 
anybody, besides you mentioned some body earlier on? 
 

A: No, no, I don™t know anybody. And several time s, my
 cardiologist, who is Jewish, and is very 
active in one of the synagogues in Le xington, me nti
oned that the rabbi is 
going to get in touch 
with me , be cause he wants me  to come  and talk
 to some  group within the congregation, but they 
never contacted me . I really don™t have
 any connection to any other group. 
 

Q: Do you feel any desire or any intere
st in having that kind of connection? 
 

A: I wouldn™t mi nd. I™ m c o mpletely neutral. I am
 not going out of my way to look for it, and... 
because I don™t like to dwell that mu ch upon past
. And... but I wouldn™t reject
 if they... if they 
would want to establish 
any contact with me .  
 

Q: You live in a rural ar
ea of, you know, central Kentucky, and ther
e are a lot of, I mean, as far as 
other... as far as mi nority groups, other than th
e ma in group, the... probably the ma in other group 

would be mi grant workers, and I™m i nterested 
in just hearing your... your
 perceptions of how 
people in the area deal with 
mi nority groups, and your observati
ons about... about that, if you 
have any. 
 

A: I consider this very similar to what wa s goi
ng on in Germany while we lived there. Germany had 
an economic boom in the 1950™s, just like we have
 now, which me ant that the... all the me nial 
and dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just woul
dn™t want to work in that, and also that they 
needed more workers than the country actually
 could produce. So th
ey invited in other 
nationalities as guest workers, th
at™s what they were called, and 
they were ma inly from Turkey. 
And this was back in the 50™s. The German
 economi c mi racle produ
ced a mi gration from 
Turkey, which was legal, completely legal. They 
had to have documents, they entered, they went 
to work in the factories. Now, today, in
 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has 
slowed down considerably. These Turkish worker
s, the original Turkish workers, today are 
grandparents. They brought their children back 
then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very 
nice, humanitarian gestur e, b
ecause Switzerland, who had the same  problem, did not allow 
fa mily me mbers to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody 

was allowed to... allowed to come . So, the fa
mily me mbers came, and you know, one family 
me mber then brings another family me mber, and 
pretty soon... I think t
oday there are close to 
three million Turks living in Germa ny, a country of 
sixty-five million people. That™s quite a bit, 
and of course, was tremendous resentme nt by some people to begin with. But the real problem 

came not while the economi c boom was on, the real
 problem c a me  when it was over, because 
now you had a lot of people who were already adu
lts, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, 
and all the rest. So now, here came the problem of
 what to do with them. Are they citizens, are 
they not citizens?  And welfare, are they qualified 
for welfare?  So, I am afraid of the same  thing 
here. Right now, especially around here, in the 
Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that 
these illegal... or legal Mexican 
workers are fulfilling an
 important job. They 
are working here in 
a job that most other people wouldn™t take. So, 
nobody has great reservations. When they see... I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467  
91 
 
 
heard that when they see some thing in the paper,
 that a thief was arrest
ed, or a murder happened, 
and it is a Spanish name , they do mu mble about 
it, which is natural, I don™t consider this 
extraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is
 going to happen when this economic boom ends, 
and here we will be with these people. Now, they
 are not going to work. If they don™t work, what 
will happen to them?  To their 
mi nd?  What will ha ppen to those who watch around, and will take 
the opportunity to do the same  as
 they do in Germany. The skinheads in Ge rmany were burning 
down the buildings where they lived. People died 
in fire, they were beat
en up on the street, or 
they were killed. Several, several times this happened. So, I hope that we™d... it doesn™t come  to 
this. I think that the... we need more education, 
especially in the schools,
 to ma ke these people 
welcome. They are here for a reason, they ar
e huma n beings, and just like anyone else in 
A merica, they came in by the samerights. If there is illegal immigra
tion, that is not for Kentucky 
to try to stop it, because we
 can™t, it has to be stopped dow
n on the border, that™s not our 
problem. But those who are here, they are here. 
So what are you going to do?  But the churches, 
the schools, any instituti
on, I think should work together to 
make sure that people know that 
these are huma n beings, these are not some  alie
n group that is here only temporarily. They are 
not here temporarily.  
 

Q: Do you draw... when you think about this i
ssue, does you mind draw 
parallels to your own 
experience, and experience of Jews in Europe?  
I mean, even though it™s not... I mean, with the 
Jews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of y
ears and they certainly 
belonged there, but... but the id
ea of some  kind of economi c problems making one majority 
group turn against a mi nority group and pers
ecuting them. Do you think that ma kes you 
particularly– 
 

A: Yeah,yes– 

 
Q:  ... sensitive? 
 

A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is 
a comparison. I... definitely, that– they would be 
ma de scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fa
ll. But I don™t think that  in America we ever 
have a danger of the death camps or concentrat
ion camps any more. I know 
that we had them, of 
course, on a much, much smaller 
and different scale, for the Ja
panese Americans in the West 
coast, but I don™t think that would 
ever come  to this. I™m mo re af
raid of individual treatment of 
these people. 
 

Q: Incidents like skinheads getting– 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that 
we deal in school, we deal with them realistically, 
that we let their children come to school without
 any reservation, because
 children in the world 
everywhere, ma kes no difference where they come
 from, where they go
, they should be in 
school. And number two is that we do not go ove rboard with bilingual education. These kids 

know how to speak Spanish, they should know how 
to speak English, and even the families, I 
think, would appreciate the fact, 
that we would just throw them 
into an English speaking class, 
and I can guarantee that in three months, they 
would speak English, without even an accent.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467

Q: The one thing that I... that I mi ssed asking wa
s about your parents. I... you me ntioned, ma ybe in 
the last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding. 
 
A: Mm-hm. Not for my we dding. 

 

Q: Not for your wedding? 

 

A: Mm- mm,no. 

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I 
think, six weeks or seven 
weeks. And my mother, 
of course, would have loved to stay here. My fath
er, he was just used to his life in Budapest, and 
he was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So 
there was no question that 
they would stay here. 
And my father, who has always b
een around little businesses in hi
s life, he did the usual thing 
that people at that time did, from Eastern Europe
, traveling to the We st, they were constantly 
counting what... certain prices on 
me rchandise, it would cost in 
Hungary, in Hungarian money. I 
mean, I was thinking about getting him a little ca lc
ulator , but he was so fa st in his head, he 
would beat any calculator. So, hi
s favorite place... and we lived 
in Californi a when they were 
with us, was Long™s Drugstore, which is the equiva
lent of any big drugsto
re chain in our area. 
And he... he would just... if we did some thing, the 
rest of the fa mily, with my mother, and he did 

not want to be part of it, he
 just said, ﬁOh, just drop me  at
 Long™s Drugstore,ﬂ and he would 
spend an entire day at Long™s Drugstore, l
ooking... going around, looki
ng everything, figuring 
out prices and this. So, yeah. 
 

Q: They– 
 
A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a b
it suspicious, what is this ma n doing here, and 
he was smiling always, because he couldn™t speak
 a word of English. So, finally, I had to... I 
explained, I talked to the people,
 and said, ﬁThis is my father, 
he doesn™t speak any English, and 
he loves your store.ﬂ And this is all he did. We  
drop him off here, he™s totally harmless. He never 
killed a fly in his life. He  just likes to... and so
 they laughed, and they ju
st... and eventually they 
all kind of tried to communicate w
ith him and he with them. And 
another thing that... just blew 
his mi nd, that all you can eat little places in San 
Francisco. And we used to go to one that had 
very nice stuff, stea m table, of course. And he 
just could not understand th
at here, we were five, 
seven people go, and of course, the kids kept goi
ng back and taking more and this and that, and 
so finally he said, ﬁI can™t,ﬂ 
he said, ﬁin Hungary, a restaurant
 like this would go broke in one 
day.ﬂ So, my wife went to get the manager, a
nd it... she was a very nice lady, and explain to her 
where my father come s from and what these que
stions are, so she sat down with us, and she 
said– ‚cause my father said, ﬁHow do you ma ke
 money, all you can eat? ﬂ  So, she then pointed 
out to my fa ther, that look, ﬁH
ere is your granddaughter. Look wh
at she has. She really didn™t 
take much. Look at your wife, she didn™t eat th
at much. Look at you, you 
didn™t eat that much. 
The two boys,ﬂ she said, ﬁthe two boys, okay, so 
they mi ght take up... up to the price that they 
paid, but look, all of you, you™re 
eat–ﬂ and so, she was very patie
ntly explaining. She said, ﬁOur 
problem is not what people eat, it™s what people 
try to put into their jacket.ﬂ She says, ﬁYou™d be 
surprised how ma ny people come  in here with
 a bag, and all this.ﬂ 
My father could not

understand this, that even in America people– b
ecause he had, certainly, a very idealistic vi ew 
of America. But I forgot to tell you that every 
time we picked him up from Long™s Drugstore, he 
learned this sentence to say. Firs
t he learn it in... he said it in
 Hungarian, then I taught him how 
to say in English, so the childre
n can understand. He says, ﬁThis 
country is invincible.ﬂ After 
looking at the drugstore, he ma de up his mi nd, that ba
sed on this wealth that is in this... just in 
this store, and the way people just come  in 
and can afford and buy, all this... he said, ﬁThis 
country, my son, is invincible.ﬂ He had unlimited 
faith in this country. 
And I don™t know whether 
in a previous interview I told you, when people 
ask him, ﬁ Why don™t you stay here? ﬂ  He told 
them a joke. I think I– 
 
Q: Yeah, you did, you did, yeah. 

 

A: ... I say it, so I™m not going to repeat that, 
but he... he truly, he... w
ith all the wealth, and 
everything else that just enchante
d him, he... and the nice aesthetics 
of the stores, he was ready to 
go home. 
 

Q: What year did he die, he and your mother? 

 

A: My mother died in 1971, and my
 father died in, let™s see, 1980. 

 

Q: Had you seen them again, since... in between– 

 

A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, 
yeah. I was in Germany, so they called me  and I 
come , and he had a stroke, and... but I was not wi
th my mother when she was dying. My father 

just called me. So... but they have always 
been great supporters of the United States. 
 
Q: Do you have anything else that you™d 
like to add?  I™m about out of questions. 
 
A: Well, if you give me  a couple of mi nutes– 

 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: ... You can stop that, and see 
if there™s anything else, okay? 
 

Q: Shall I pause it? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Are you involved with any other activities 
besides the Master Gardener™s Association? 
 

A: Yes, we are enthusiastic me
mbers of the Elder Hostel progr
am. We  have... my wife, I think, 
participated in just about fifteen
 or so, and I am just about five behind. And what we usually do, 
we are taking hands-on type classes. My idea 
is that I want to know
 everything before I go, 
about... a little about a lot of things, such as 
I have always wondered about blacksmithing. What 
does a blacksmith do?  How does he do it?  So I 
took a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in 
kaleidoscope making, because that interested
 me ... me , too. How does a kaleidos cope  work?

How do you ma ke one?  And I took several classes 
in wood turning, which I 
enjoy very much as 
a hobby. We  also took a beautiful class, which was 
not hands-on, but still some thing similar, to... 
in Hawaii, an Elder Hostel class for two weeks. 
We were studying the volc
anoes, the rainforest  
and then Polynesian culture. My wife is very 
active in basket weaving. She™s a me mbe r  of the 
basket weavers... Kentucky Basket
 Weavers Association, or what
ever... I don™t know if this is 
the official na me , but she participates, she exhi
bits some ti me s. Also, she™s a quilter, so as a 
quilter, she come s in contact with a lot of trul
y Kentuckians. And she doe
sn™t ever come home 
complaining that ma ybe they considered her an 
outsider. She feels very much at home with all 
these people. We  also go to We st Virginia, to 
Cedar Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian 
center for crafts, and take  a hands-on class. Our ne
xt class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, 
we have taken a class in Charlest
on and we want to go back, this 
is our next class. We  studied 
outdoor cooking and we are going back now to 
study Charleston™s garden
s. We  take trips. 
 

Q: Is this West Virgin
ia, or South Carolina?   
 

A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... 
Charleston, South Carolina. And while there, we 
visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascin
ated by Savannah, it was just walking around in a 
European city. And in Kentucky, too, occasiona lly 
we take trips. We  love to go, as I me ntioned, 
to Cincinnati. We  go up to Louisville. My wi
fe, as a quilter, goes some times to western 
Kentucky, which is the quilter™s place, you know
, Paducah is the quilter™s museum. In other 
words, we are active here, and I took the class 
in History of Cincinna
ti, in northern Kentucky. 
And I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, Th
e Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist 
organizations. I volunteered to participate in
 the Kentucky water watch program, whi c h I 
enjoyed very much. It just ende
d with the Licking River, and th
e branch here in Paris, Stoner 
Creek, was our responsibility. Four time s a yearwe had to go down and take samples, and... so 

that was, I fe lt I was part of Kentucky, doing this. 
We are... we try to stay
 active and my wife is 
ma inly involved with these quieter things, and I 
am... I like to get involved
 with some thing that 
takes me out in nature and puts me in a kayak, or
 out ther e, really fi ghting the elements. I still 
have a little bit of that
 spark. So, if I can ma nage, and if my 
heart gets better 
after the operation 
this fall, I™d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of
 the two, and just go on th
ese little rivers here. 
So– 
 

Q: Well,thankyou. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Is there anything else? 
 
A: No, I don™t think so. That™s abou
t it. I mean, I can™t... can™t really– 
 

Q: Well, thank you. This concludes the...
