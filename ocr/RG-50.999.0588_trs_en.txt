David, it was less thana month bef ore your 17thbirthday when theNazis invaded 
Poland on September
 
1, 1939. Before youtalk about your lif eduring the war and the 

3 
 
Holocaust, let's startfirst with you telling us about your fam ily, your comm unity, and yourself in 
Kozienice before the war began. 
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, I was born September
 
27, 1922. T he Germ ans attacked Pola
nd 
September
 
1. I was 16 years old. I was going to school andI worked in m yf ather'sf actory 
som etimes after school. My f ather had a shoe factory. There were 25, 30 people working. W e 

sold shoes wholesaleall over the country.
 
 
W elived in a big house. W e
 
hadam aid. I had two sisters and abrother. My parents 
were only in their 40s.W e lived in a niceneighborhood acrossf rom a big church.W e hada 

good lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to ask youa couple of  questionsbef ore you tell us about the 

Germ ans 
com ing in.Tell us how large was yourf am ily.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, m y f atherhadf our more brothers younger than he. My grandfather was 

a wholesale
 
--
 
had a wholesale business, selling suppliesfor shoemaking, suppliesf orf ishing 
industry, and supplies
 
for casketmaking, a big business.They were  all brothers working there. 
My f ather was 
t he  
f irst one
, s
ohe gotm arried and went on his own.
 
 
My sister was 18 or 19 when the Germ ans cam e in. My little brother was 12. And m y 
lit t le  s is t e r 8 .
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
:  And David, I was also going to ask you something you shared with me. You 
told us that yourf atherhada shoem aking business. On the sole of the shoes was stam ped a 

go a t. 
 
>> David Bayer:  A goat.The town of m y hom etown, Kozienice,meansnothing happened to 

the goat.T hat's thenam eof  thetown. Because m y area was a lot of  wild goats. So they 

named it Kozienice, goats. A princeor king or something years agocame beforeI was born. 

He went hunting and his wife yelled, 
ﬁN
othinghappened to the goat.
ﬂ 
Th
ey couldn't shoot goat.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nothing happened to the goat.
 
>> David Bayer:  Kozienice. T hat's it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Once the Germ ans occupiedPoland on September
 
1, 1939, your life and that 
of  yourf am ily changed swiftly and dram atically. T ell us what happened once the Germans 

cam e in.
 
>> David Bayer: W hen the Germ ans attacked Poland, they bombardedevery little town, ever y 

big city. E verybody wa s running away.W e run out of ourhouse and we went to stay in the 

forest becauseour house
 
--
 
our home was bom barded
, t
he area.
 
 
Af ter the Germans cam e in, September
 
9, they cam e intoour town. W hen we cam e to 
our house, everything was opened, thedoors opened, windows opened, Germans hanging 

around inm y house and plundering, taking whatever they can.T
hey took our food, our 
clothing.T hey took all the shoes.W e had a warehouse in the backyard. Everything was 

ra n
sa cked .  
 
W ecame in scared. The Germ ans were laughing andmakingf un of us.
 
One German 
off icer askedm y father
,  ﬁW
hyare you so scared
;ﬂ
 
t he  J e
wish were scared.And said the 
reason we were so scared, we don't want tof ight, we love ever ybody.W edon't believe in 

violence. And they laughed. Madefunof  us.
 
 
And then they tookeverything. Even m y m other's linen,the linensf rom thehouse, 
dishes, t
hey took the dishes.T hey tookall the food we had.W e hadnofood anym ore. Andall 
the stores or ransacked. And we had curf ews.W ecouldn't gooutof thehouse. 
 
 
So Ialways sneaked out of the house. I tried tof indf ood.
 
There wasa Germ an group 
of  s o l d
iers, notf arf rom our home,had a compound,a lot of German soldiers. And they had a 

4 
 
f ield kitchen.And I went there to lookf orfood. So I tooka bucket, a pot with ahandle, likea 
bucket, and I took it out to that place where the Germ ans were eating and cooking theirfood. 

But when I cam eover, there was a lot of other young people anda lot of  wom en, young 

wom en also with buckets, with pots, waiting for theGermansto give them leftover. 
 
 
But I was the only Jew because other Jewish people were scaredtogo see a 
Germ an. Butall the people there were not Jewish, were Christian. And they were all m y 

f riends.W e wentto school together.W e played soccer together.W e were neighbors.Som eof  

theparents were working for m yf ather'sf actory.
 
W hen they saw m e, they pointed theirf inger 
a t m e , 
ﬁ
J ud en
, ﬂ ﬁJu d
en, ﬂ
 
to the Germ ans,pointing thef inger.W e grew up together.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But they were letting the Germ ans know you were a Jew.
 
>> David Bayer:  Buta lot of Germ ans cam eover and gave m e thebarley, beans soup.I take 

barley andbeans andpork.W e Jewish people were notallowed toeatpork. My father didn't 

want to touch it. So m y grandf ather,eat it because it'snot a sin.T o survive, you have to eat 

anything you can.
 
W ecouldn't get to the bakery. Ever ything was locked up. No stores was 
open.T hey were ransacked.W ehad curf ews, we couldn't getout. So we hadtohave 

som ething to eat. So this was thef irst.
 
 
My m other was cryin g, all the time crying and praying. She was praying. My f ather 
used to say 
God doesn't listentoher anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint soon after you were forced into theghetto.Tell us about the 

ghetto, whatthat was likef or you.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, theneighbor
hood
 
was a nice Christian area. W ehad anice big home. 
I
t's still there now. I don't know who owns it. I didn't claim  it so thePolish governm ent saidI 
owe a lot of money f ortaxes. So somebody is livin g there and I don't even carefor thathouse. 

I wouldn't live in Poland if they paid
 
$1
 
m illion every day. I li ve here. 
 
 
W hat ha p pe n ed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the ghetto, yeah. 
 
>> David Bayer:  Thef irst few days they told us to put theStarof  David on our door
, t
hat we 
were Jewish
, 
Jewish people live here.
 
T hen they gi ve us anorder that we had tom ove out. Al
l 
the Jewish people who lived in the Christian area had tom ove toa Jewish neighborhood.They 

m ade a ghetto.T he Germ ans put barbed
-
wi r e and they gave us one room . W eused to have 
six, seven room s inour house.W e hada room for ourm aid who used to live with us. So we 

got one room  in somebody else's apartment.
 
 
T he Germ ans grabbed m e to work every day som ewhereelse. Oneday the Germans 
were digging an irri gation canal about six m iles outof our town. It took about400, 500 young 

m e nf r om  ou r  t o wn
 t
o work
 
in the canal. AndI was oneof  them  working the irrigation canal, 
diggin g ditches,big shovels and wheel barrels. 
 

 
T he ghetto was ver y bad. ButI was going to work to the canal, working, in anarea 
with f armers, with a lotoff ood.T hefarmers had potatoes aneverything. I used to steal the 

potatoesf rom  thef ield. Andthen I wenttofarm ers begging f or bread. And then thef arm ers 

askedm e if  I could sell them something. So whatever the Germ ans give us, clothing, I sold it to 

the farmers f or food. And the
n when we came hom e, shared with my parents,m y sister and 

brother. 
 
 
T hisdidn't last long.
 
Itwas going on until September
 
27,1942, theday I was born. 
T he Germ ans took all the people of m y townon a trainand shippedthem  toTreblinka, to the 

settlem ent. Actually took them there to kill tokill ever ybody, 8,000 people inm y town
, m
y 

5 
 
m other,m y father, m yuncles,m y sister, m y brother,everybody. M y grandpa's dying in the 
ghetto f rom  hunger, couldn't survive. 
 
 
So after they did that, the Germ ans took us awa y f rom the canal and shippedme to a 
place called Pionki, a big am munitionf actory in Polandnotf arf rom m y hometown,m aybe20, 

25
 
kilom eters.T hey taught me
 
how to m akeexplosives for bullets. I worked in the centrifuge 
departmentfor two years, m aking explosives. I became a chem ist.Iknew how to do itand it 

kept m e alive.
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
:  It wasver y dangerous work. W asn't it, David?
 
>> David Bayer:  Thegases were eating usup.T hey gave us special clothing, special shoes
, 
w
ooden shoes. A
nd a lot of people died from  exhaustionandf rom  the gases. 
 
 
I worked with ci vilians, Polish people who wor ked inthef actory bef ore the war. So 
whatever the Polishpeople were sharing somef ood with us,this helpedm e a lot.
 
 
I dida lotof  work for a Polish man. He used to work at the f actory there. He used to 
get paid, go to work and com ehom e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Pols were able to get paid their regular job.
 
>> David Bayer:  Before the war andduring the war Germ ans occupied it.But us they didn't 

p
ay. T hey gave us only som e clothing.T hey killed other peopleto give us the clothing. And 
som e clothing, some shoes were good, soI sold them tothe Polishpeople I worked with and 

they broughtm ef ood.And this keptm e going. I was healthier. Because if I had nofood, I 

couldn't work. T he gases
 
--
 
we didn't have it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e there was lots of sm uggling and bartering for food.
 
>> David Bayer:  Andalso, we had 
t o 
work with all kinds of chem icals. Andalso they used100 
proof  alcohol to 
m akespecial explosive. Sowho worked with thealcohol? Only Jewish people. 

T he Germ ans didn't allow the Polsbecausethe Pols were drinking.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> David Bayer:  AndJewish peoplenot drinking. So I stolea lotof thealcohol, put it in little 

bottles and exchanged with the Pols.
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, you toldm ethat non
-
sm okers were lucky.
 
>> David Bayer:  Ok.Talking about sm oking.Cotton is used to make explosives, powder. The 

Germ ans didn'thave cotton. So they m ade im itation cottonf rom  paper.T here was a 

department, a lot of people worked there,a lot of  Jewish wom an
, 
a lot of men. There was one 
guy who worked especially from m y department. He was putting thecotton on the conveyor . 

And shipped tom y departm ent, which Im ixed with the ch
e m ic a ls .
 
This guy was a sm oker. He 
worked with m eand three other guys.W e weref ive people in this departm ent. Andhe smoked 

cigarettes,f oodfor cigarette. And som etim es he volunteered
 
--
 
andI also volunteered 
som etimes
 
--
 
to clean Germ an offices and ev
erything else in thef actory. And we pickedup 
buttsf rom cigarettes that the Germ ans sm oked. Ipicked it up and put it in my pocketand sold 

it forf ood.W hoever need cigarettes gave away their bread.
 
 
T his guy, a sm oker
 
--
 i
t was night shift. He worked 12 hours aday. He was tired.T he 
cigarettef all on the conveyor. It ignited.T heconveyor cam e inandthere was abig f ire.They 

tookus out.T hey were  going to hang us.T hey didn'tf oolaround.
 
 
But what happened, there were two old men,Germ ans,engineers, in charge ofm y 
department. They came in. Onenam e was Dr.
 
Vitter and the other, Dr.
 
Lesher. I never forget 
thatnam e. I have to rem em ber that name.T he two Germansaskedthe Gestaponot to killus 

because they neededfor thefactory. And they let us go. They canceled the hanging.T here 

6 
 
was an announcem ent, a big splash,everybo dy should see that wewere hanging because we 
did sabotage.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You also triedescaping f rom Pionki several times.
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah. I escaped onetim e. Igot shot. I didn'tescapef rom thefactory. I 

escapedf rom the camp.W e went through the barbed
-
wire.W e cut the barbed
-
wire. But poor 
guys. Som ebody m usthave snitched,theGerm ans.T hey were waiti ng.W hite uniform s, 

m achine guns.W e were trying to get through,
 
them achine guns. I got shot inm y leg. I was 
lyin g in the snow. And the Germans thought Iwas dead.They lef t us lying there in the snow. 

And the guysf rom thecam p cam e in and they took us in. A doctor sewed m eup. After a while 

I went backto work.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  In addition to getting shot, you were also, if  I remember correctly, seriously 
burned ina locom otive fire.
 
>> David Bayer:  Thiswas later on.Butbefore that Iescaped onceagainf rom thefactory with 

a guy nam ed Mosze Matis. He was maybe 7
 
feet tall tom e. He wasworkin g like a gorilla. He 
was working f or a Polish worker in factory. He was taking out
 
the chem icalsf rom  the train, 
f rom  thetankers, andput it in the building. He saidtom ethere was a chance toescape and 

join the underground,Polish Arm y, in the forest.W e couldf ight theGerm ans.
 
So I agreed with 
him .W e wentout under the barbed
-
wire.W ewent to theforest.W ewalked in the villages. W e 
saw big posters everywhere we went. " 10 litres of  vodka to bring ina Jew."  T he Germ an 
g i ve  

10
 
liters of vodka to bring in a Jew dead oralive.
 
 
W hat we did?W emade au
-t
urnand went back to thefactory. I was m ore secure in 
th e
 
factory than outside. T his was the other escape. And thenI escaped again.
 
>> Bill Benson: We'll com e back toth
at .
 
>> David Bayer:  I survived this tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hereyou are in Pionki doing the slave labor. Butthe Russians were closing 

in. And asthe Russians got closer, you were forcedoutof Pionki.Tell us.
 
>> David Bayer:  TheGermans tookover Europe and wanted to take Russia. Russia was not 

so easyf or the Germans to take. So winter cam e. And theGermans were f reezing to death. 

And the Russians were burning all the houses, all the little towns, all theVillages, all thefood. 

T he Russian were b
urning
 
everything up for the
 
Germ ans
 
tof reeze to death
;  
they couldn't 
f ight.Everything was cold.T hey were losing t he war. The Russianspushed theGermansback. 

T he Germ ans were taking ever ything they could, dism antled the Pionkif actory. T hey takeus 

wi t h  t
hem  to Germ any to work in Germany.W e had to march in
 
the snow, in the winter, in 
January
 
1945
 
--
 
1944,December to 1945.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about leaving Pionki and going toAuschwitz.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, I was in a school inVirginia andone man
 
asked m e did I ever 
encountera good Germ an. I'll com eto that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. 
 
>> David Bayer:  So I told him , I said, yeah, we had a good German, a nice engineer who used 

to com e in thefactory, usedtof ix the pum psandthe machinery. He was very
 
polite. He said 
good morning. He was thank you. Really pleasant guy. He never hit us, never beatus.So that 

wa s  
a 
nice Germ an. Ok? 
 
 
But, whenthe Germ ans were f leeing and tryi ng to escape and wanted to dismantle the 
m achinery
,  
this niceGerm ans cam e in to ourcam p and askedfor volunteers. Other Germans 
cam e in,nobody wanted to go.T hey were hi ding under the bed.They were hiding in theforest. 

W edidn't wantto go.He came in. Everybody was raising their hand and running tohim  

7 
 
because we knew hewas a
 
nice guy.
 
T his Germ an got conf used. He thought we were running 
to him  andhurthim because we were rushing to the gate. Hepulleda pistoland shot the 
crowd. 
  
 
Andhe was the goodGerm an. He killed a guy and injured another one. He was a 
good Germ an, but hewas still a Nazi, still pul led a gun and shot in the crowd. So this is the 

answer I gave him  about a good German.
 
 
So what happened,they f inally tookus out by train and shippedusto Auschwitz. 
T here were over 100people in a wagon, in thef reight car. Nof ood.A lot didn'tm ake it.W e 

were choked inside. No water, nonothing.
 
W e cam e to Auschwitz
 
--
 
actually, Birkenau. W e 
walked to Auschwitz.
 
 
T alking about m y burn, got injured. But before this happened I was working on a 
locomotive to transport the
 
powder tom ake plastic rollers. A spark cam e out, some powder 
ignited and burned mein m y arm s,face, andm y legs. So Ididn't goto work anym ore. I got 

cream s on m e.
 
 
W hen I came to Auschwit z, I still was
 
--
 
crust onm y f ace andeverywhere else.T here 
wa
s a guy, a prisonerwho helped me getout of  thef reight car, saidtom e,"W hat happened to 
you?"  And I told him. So he said, " If a German ask you whathappenedto you,tell them that 

you are a chem ist andyou m ake explosives. T hey're going to needyou."
 
 
Sure enough, a Gestapo cam e over and checked everybody else and pulledme 
aside
, m
e and otherpeople.And a lot of them got killed. And they took us to the gypsy cam p 
where all the gypsies were li ving. T here was a barrack, maybe 75, 100 of us separatepeop
le .
 
 
In them eantim e,a Germ an Jewish doctor used to come with the Red Cross band and 
he was giving m e cream s. It got clear. OtherGerm ans,dignitaries came in and picked people. 

T hey picked us to work in the coal m ine.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you told the Gestapoofficer that you were a chemist.
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah. But he just putm e aside in case somebody needs me.Butthey didn't 

need me to be a chem ist.T hey took me to the coal m ine. So I wentwith the others to work  in 

the coal m ine.
 
 
T he coal m ine was
 
the worst thing in the world
, u
nderground, 12 hours a day.W ehad 
a quota.W e hadtom ake 18 wagons of  coal, little small wagons. Couldn'teven do that. 

Sometimes they lef t us to stay overnight in the m ine.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to interrupt youfor a second. Because the quota,these 18 cartsthat 

you had to do

what happened,we stole the previous shift, 
whoever worked bef ore. And we put ournumbers on the wagon and tooktheirs off.And this 

was going on like this. The Germ ans didn't have m uch coal.W e were cheating.
 
 
Also, them ine, the people who was the regular job, we tooktheir coal. And 
som etimes

in m y department we were hungr y.W hatthey gave us was ver y, ver y badf ood. 
T hey used to call ita Rom anian nam ef oroursoup. And the bread was sticky like glue.W e 

didn't keep it because we were scared to lose it
, k
eep it in m y pocket or som ebody steals it 
f rom  you.So whenever I have apieceof bread, them orning, I ate itright awa y. Starving lat er 

on.T hena lot of people were hungry. In the coal m ines,they have layers of  coal, layers of  

som e kindof  clay, looks like m argarine, like butter.Som epeople were eating that, ju

hallucinating and eating.

>> David Bayer:  They never m ade it. They died.
 
 
Inm y departm ent there was a young m an who died that way. T hey took him  out.The 
next day they replaced him  with another young m an,a religious Jewish boy with a little beard, 
t a ll,  s k in n y
, c
onstantly was prayin g.W henever you lookedathim ,he was praying. His name 
was Ruben. He wasf rom  Poland.
 
He was praying all the time.W e talked to eachother that
 
he's crazy. He's prayin g. And he hada lot of tim e.W e saidhe's crazy. He said, 
ﬁ
I 'm  n o t crazy.  
Yo u  kin d  of. I'm  no t crazy.ﬂ
 
He was praying. H e
 
cited the psalm , continuously cited the psalm .
 
 
And then there was aGestapom an, a supervisor with the unifor

a stick, likea pick, with a pickhandle
, m
adeout of copper. He was hitting people over the head 
and killing them . He killed a lotof  people. Hewas supposed to go around and check the coal, 

where to drill, you know.
 
 
Inm y group there wasa m iner, regular guy who usedto come to work. He was drilling 
andputting thedynam ite in. He put dynam ite in. After you're ready to blow, you have to yell 

" F i re  i

Ruben cam e out and s

everyb ody 
shutup. Nobody said a word anym ore to him.He survi ved and lives i n Jerusalem . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, while you were in Auschwitz, you also had surgery whi le you were 

there.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell,ever y m orning when we were going to work, the roll call.W e stand in 

the line.T he Gestapom an pass by, checksever ybody; a stick in his hand,he checked.
 
I had m y glands swell up. I was covering up with m y collar f rom m yjacket,my dirty coal jacket. 

He noticed up. He came over, pushed away the coat,and m y glands were s wollen like this. He 

called up another kapo and they tookm e to aclinic. 
 

 
T hey put m e down in
 
the clinic and they cut m e without anesthetic,without anything 
else.T hey tiedm e upon the table.T he guy, the doctor who was doing the job, was sm iling at 

m e, with a sm ilingf ace and looked atm e. Hecut me,no injection, no medicine, no nothing, 

ju s t  
tied me up. Andthe blood was com ing out. I was lying there in pain. 
 
After the operation, 
af ter their experim ent, he sewed m e up and left m e lie on the bed. 
 

 
In that clinic there wasa lotof  prisoners whowere working
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likeorderlies.
 
>> David Bayer:  Andnuns. There was one guy who was like an orderly. He was a nurse.He 

was f rom m y hom etown in Poland. He was our neighbor, lived about two blocks away f rom m e. 

I knew him  very well. I knew his m other. Hism other was a post office director. And he saw me. 

He said,"T hey going t o kill you."  He calledme Duvtche inPolish. My name was David. Knew 

m e. W e played 
soccer. He was a coach. He said, ﬁI will tr y to save you.
ﬂ 
He m ade a f alse 
paper in Germ an, tiedm e upand everything else, andI'm ableto go back to work. I walked out 

of  the clinic, went back to m y barrack and went to work.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  I thinkjust recently you f ound in the archives of them useum , recently 
acquired, the Germ anrecords of that surgery.
 
>> David Bayer:  I got them right herebecause I got copiesof  it. And theGermandoctor who 

operatedonm e, there's a story abouthim . He was a doctor in the Russian front. He got sick.

So som eone advisedhim  to get a job inAuschwit z. So heappliedand they tookhim  in to 
A u sch wi

So they senthim toa cam p which the coalm ine was. His nam e was Fis
c
her. He was 
a Germ an.T hey gave him  a home. He was doing experim ents.T hey claim  in here that he 

killed 70,000 people.
 
 
He escaped
 
and was living in east Germany, under the Russians. About 10, 15 years 
ago, they f ind him  and they hanged him .T hey had a trialand he was hanged. He was adoctor 

in a littletown with his family like nothing happened.
 
 
An d
 
even, this ishis report, his signature,and m y nam eand what he did to me.The 
report. So they f ind this in Germ any in the archives.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just recently.
 
 
David, in January 1945, one day whi le you we re in the coal m ines you were all pulled 
out of  the coal m ine and then forced on a Death March.
 
>> David Bayer: W enam ed it Death March because the Germ ans told ustohook up, under 

arm s,each other, eight in a row and march
 t
owards Germ any. T he m ain highway was f ull of  
Germ an tanksandtrucks running away f rom  the Russians. And
 
they toldus to go into the 
f ields, inthe snow, thecountry roads.W hoeverf ell down, a bullet inthehead. Andthousands 

of  thousands of people were killed like this.
 
 
I had af riendnext tome who couldn't walk anym ore. Hefell down. A Germanbent 
over,
 
boom , in the head. I stopped and Itookhis jacketand Iprayed over him . I askedfor 
forgi veness I takehis jacket,hedidn't need it anym ore. The jacket was f ull of blood. I wiped it 

off  with the snow.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this was the winter of  1944,1945. Very cold. 
 
>> David Bayer: W e keep walking, keep walking. T hen we walked to aplace called 

Blechhamm er,another concentration cam p.There were a lot of British soldiers there, Russian 

prisoners. Chased us in, nof ood, no nothing.But there were buildings. And everybody was 

tryin g to break intothe buildings.T here was warehouses with a lot of food but everybody took 

whatever they could.
 
Iwent to one warehouse, there was margarine. SoI grabbed the 
m argarine. I tookm argarine and I put it under m y shirt, inm y pants,wherever I can. It wasso 

cold.W ehad nothing to eat. 
 
 
T he Germ ans were announcing to come outagain, marching.W e didn't want to go. 
So I went with two Russian prisoners toa barbed
-
wire.W e went under the snow, went out,and 
went 
through the forest.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you broke out.
 
>> David Bayer:  Of  Blechhamm er.W estayed in theforestfor six days and six nights.W e had 

bombardm ents, com ing and going.W e heard the war was going on.W e lied inthe snow under 

pine trees. W e ate 
bark. Thetwo prisoners were Russian soldiers, lookingf orm ushroom s 
under the snow.W e shared. I shared them argarine with them .T hem argarinemelted. I didn't 

takenobath. It was so dirty. Ever ybody licke d it like it was the bestice cream . 
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  And this helped you to survive.
 
>> David Bayer:  And then we decided to getoutbecauseI was f reezing to death.T he 

Russians cam e.W e saw Russian people with the guns.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Russian Arm y was com ing.
 
>> David Bayer: W edidn't know if  
they were Russian or Germans. W e didn't care no m ore. 

And they were Russian. One Russian soldier pickedm e up, carriedm e. I weighed maybe60, 

70
 
kilos.I was nothing.
 

10
 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were half of  yourbody weight.
 
>> David Bayer:  I was just bones.T hey tookm e intoa wom an
;s
 
hom e, a Germ an wom anwith 
a daughter.Andthe Russians said take careof m e, spoke toher inGerm an.
 
Actually, one was 
a Russian Jewish off icer. He spoke Jewish, too
, a
lso Germ an
 b
ut an off icer.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So heordered these Germ an wom en to take you in?
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah. She took care of m e.Shedidn't havem uch to eat anyway. She m ade 

som e kindof  cream soup or something.Shebathedm e. She gave m e some clothing, wom an's 

clothing. Nom en.T hey m ust be in theArm y or something.I was going to leave and she was 

crying. She didn't want m e to go. And thenthe reason she didn't wantm e to go is because she 

didn't want the Russian soldiers to com e.T hey were two wom en.They would have raped 

them . She said
,  ﬁS
tay, please.
ﬂ 
Sh
e had a cow. T hey hadnothing eat she told me but thecow 
in the barn. 
 
 
W hat happened to Ruben, the young man who believed inm iracles, he was going with 
us, with thetwo Russian prisoners toescape,buthe got injured. Som ething happened tohim  

and he wa
s bleeding.Must be a bulletor som ething. He couldn't walk anym ore. So we put him  

in a barn.And we keptgoing.
 
Af ter the war, he was found by the Russians also, and they put 
him  inthe hospitaland he lived in Germ any. Andf rom Germany, the Israelis and 
Palestinians, 
Jews f rom Palestine cam e in and sm uggledhim  to Israel. But he was caught and lockedup.
 
 
Af ter theW ar of Independence, he cam eto
 
Israel. T hen I went to Panam a and then to 
Israel.W hen I came to a center who do I see? Ruben is standing there. He recognized m e. A 

religious guy with long beard
 a
nd praying. And he said, " My God.I can't believe it." That'sm e. I 
was already in Panama and I was in theArmy already and everything else. And then I went to 

see him  onetim e. He lives in Jerusalem . Hehas 11 children.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  I n t he lit t le  t im e t ha t

we still have som e tim e. Once you were liberated, you 
decided to go back toPoland.T ell us about going back to Poland.
 
>> David Bayer: W hen I gotbackon the road, the Germ an wom anwas cr ying
 
and I was 
leaving her, she toldme how to getto thehighway. It was RussianArm y and refugees. 

Ever ybody was walkin g outf rom  hiding. TheGerm an houses were em pty. A lotof Germ an 

houses were empty becausethe Germ ans run away to escape theRussians.T here was a lot 

of  beautif ul homes with beds and everything else. Soonthe way wal king, we stopped in 

homes every day in adifferent house.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the next day get up andcontinue walking. 
 

>> David Bayer:  Onehouse I pickedupa big coat, a Germ an off icer's coat. I put iton. And the 

Russian saw m e. I'm  not aGerman. I'm a refugee. He said
,  ﬁT
ake it off because we don't know 
who you areﬂ
 
I had to throw awa y a warm  Germ an coat.
 
 
And then one tim eI stopped ina hom eandIstole a bicycle. It was outside. I was 
walkin g with thebicycl e tothe highway. T wo Russians with a jeep cam e over, knockedm e off  

thebicycle and took it.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heystole thebicycle f rom  you.
 
>> David Bayer:  No.They took itbackto that wom an
,  th

>> Bill Benson:  She said you took her bicycle.
 
>> David Bayer:  I took her bicycle. It was ahard way to go home.
 
 
And then a lot of tim es, the Russian soldiers stopped with the trucksandthey give you 
a lift. But some of them were Russian wom en
 
soldiers.T hey were wo rse. The women very 
bad. They wantedm eto go with them , you know. T hey were the real McCoys, characters.
 

11
 
 
 
Sof inally I reached Poland, m y hom etown. Nobody there. I saw thehome where I was 
born, where I lived. There were otherpeople livin g there. I walked in, thePol was scared. He 
said, ﬁHere's papers. Ilive here now.
ﬂ 
>> Bill Benson:  In your home.
 
>> David Bayer:  Inm y house. AndI recognized things. SoI said, don't worry, I'm  not going to 

takenothing. I'm not going to stay. I stayedfor af ew days. I went to a Polishm an who used to 

work f or m yf ather. I w

So thenother people com e back. Otherf riends of m ine com eback

>> Bill Benson: T obring you
 
to
 
Palestine. Right?
 
>> David Bayer:  They told us to goto Czechoslovakia, go to Germ any. From there we going 

to transfer you to Palestine.
 
 
So we listened to them.W e keep going f rom one place to the other. I wind up in a DP 
cam p, displaced perso

Germ any. Over there the Am ericans cam e in.They gave us

100 
years old, maybe.
 
 
From  there I went to France, Paris. I spenteverything over there. From over there I 
went to Holland. Itooka shipto Panama.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this was 1947 when youleftf orPanama.W hyPanama?
 
>> David Bayer: W hy?When I was
 
in DP cam p, the Am erican Ambassadorf rom Munich sent 
m ea letter that somebody in Panama is looking for me. I was on a list

survi vor. He hadm y 
name, that this was afriend of m ine who went to school with me and his parentsem igratedto 

Panama before t
he war and they had been looking for relatives andf riends.So they askedme 
if  I wantedto come toPanama. So Iagreed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you went to Panam a.
 
>> David Bayer:  I could have com e 
to  
United States if  I had a way b ut takes a while. So 
Panam
a, there was a ship going to Panamaf rom  Holland. SoI wentto Panam a.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You spent a year inPanama at thattim e.
 
>> David Bayer:  And I went to Panama. I was a while there. I was in Panam afor a while. I 

didn't likePanam a City so I went to
 
live with the Indians. From  Panam ato Costa Rica.I was 
m aking leatherfor them . They were m aking shoes. They were nice people. 
 
 
Andover there I metaJewish gu y, Sam  washis nam e.W hen he saw m e, he said,

getm arried, livewith the Indians?W hy 
don't you goto Israel, plenty of  independence.T hreatened of  war and they need young people 

like you. So I said, ok, I go.
 

12
 
 
 
T here was going to bea ship in Panam a 
wa s
 
going to pick up 180 trucks in the canal 
zone 
and pick up a lotof
 
--
 
you could join that ship.The ship was nam edf or the R

Force. AGreek ship, the father nam ed the ship after the son who got killed in the Air Force. 
 
So I joined that ship. And I became in chargeof  the cargo.W hen I cam e to
 
Haif a,to Israel, I 
joinedtheArm y and they sent me to the desert andthat's it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  CanIget you
 
to
 
ju st sa y
 
--
 
>> David Bayer:  Thewar.
 
>> Bill Benson:  CanIget you to say a little bit, David. On that journey, on that ship to Is
r ae l ,  
you were towin g a PTboat. Right? T ell us about that.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, when I joined that ship, there was two Mexican Jewish guys, 
volunteers, andthe crew, and me. I joined the ship.T hey got a notif ication that we should go to 

Ve
ra c ru z
, Me xico . W hy
? T here was a torpedo boat have tobetowed toPalestine.Then all of  a 
sudden they changed it and they said don't go anym ore, go to Cuba.W hy? Because two 

Am erican Navy
 
m en wi ll take thattorpedoboat to Cuba. This torpedo boat was a Germ an 
torpedo boat
 t
he Am erican governm ent got f rom theGermans.T wo Navy m en who were going 
to take it to Cuba, stole thetorpedoboatfor
 
$80,000. The Jewish agency paid them .
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas to becom e partof the Israeli Navy, ri ght?
 

>> David Bayer:  They stole itand took it to Cuba. First Ve
ra c
ruz and then Cuba. They got a 
load of  sugar.
 
 
W ell, we went to Cuba
, f
rom Panam a to Cuba. In Panama they got cable to tie this 
torpedo boat, to tow it to Israel.That's whathappened.T he torpedonever m ade itto Israel. I
t 
went to Gibraltar, nearGreece,f illed with water.W ehad to chopoff the cable. Never m ade it. 

So thef irstboat the Israelis were supposedto have never made it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you made it and served in the IsraeliArm y, saw combat during theW ar
 
of  
Independence, wentback to Panam a,and then cam e tothe UnitedStates andm et Adele.
 
>> David Bayer:  I mether at the Israeli 
c on s ul a te
 
inIsrael. I was charged f rom theArm y. I had 
nowhere to go. I hadno f am ily
, n
o nothing. There were thousands of  thousands of  people 
com ing in.There wasnowhere to sleep. I was discharged.So I slept ona bench in a park.
 
I couldn'tf ind a job. 
 
 
Oneday I went over to a park. I was hungry. I  was going to ask them an to give me 
som e apple cakeandsoda water.There was two ladies sitting there talking toeach other.And 

one lady yelled out to them an, " Mr.
 
Ba ye r,  Mr.
 
Bayer."  I turned around. I thought they called 
m e. Them an behind the counter was named Bayer and it was m y uncle. 
 
 
I never knew I had and uncle. He was
 
m y grandf ather's brother. He cam e to Palestine 
bef ore the war f rom  Germ any. He was a Germ an. He was a Russian soldier in the FirstW orld 

W ar. He surrenderedto the Germ ans. 
He
 
lived in Germ any
, m e
t a Germ an wom an and lived in 
Germ any until 1938. In 1938 he went to Palestine. He lived there. I didn't know I had an uncle. 
 
 
He asked me who Iam. SoI told him ,m y m other, told aboutm y cousin who went by 
m otorcycle to Palestine. He said, yeah, he ishere and lives here. Iwent to see him .
 
So  I go t 
f a m ily.  
 
 S
o I couldn'tf ind a job. I stayed with m y uncle. Im etam anf rom  Panam a. He said 
there was a ship going back to Panama. If you want to goto Panamaf orf ree, you can goon 

the ship. So I said,ok, I'll take it. I could go back and I want to. 
 
 
So I wentback to Panam a and stayed in Panam af ora while andthen I came here. I 
stayed eight years in Panam a, actually. I came here in 1955.W ith
 
$9.35 inm y pocket. I cam e 

13
 
 
to Miam i. I gotoff  the plane.I took a bus toW ashington. And that's it. I startedhere in 
W ashington.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you meet Adele?
 
>> David Bayer:  I metAdele when I went to see af riend in New York, a survivor, also lived  in 

New York. I had the address. And she introducedm e to
 
m y wif e.W e had each other. That's it.
 
I wanted to go back toPanama butm y wife said huh
-
uh.W e went to Panam a. I went with her 
to
 
Panam a. And she said " Devil's Island,"  she called it. Too hot. It's ver y hot over there. 
 
And that's it.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have a couple of quick m inutesf or some questionsf rom  our audience,for 

a couple of questions.Do

W ehave m icrophoneson either side of the aisle. Please wait until you have a

that we hear it andeverybody in the audience hears it.
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah, but m y hearing is notso good.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You've done great sofar. I saw a hand go up 
som ewhere.
 
>> 
I  wa s ju st
 
--
 
I don'tknow if  you can speakto it ornot since you were sortof  younger before 
the war really got started. A lotpeople I thinkare drawing parallels between what was 

happening in the 
`
30s in Germ any and Poland totoday, what's happening sortof  in certain 
places.I'm  just wondering if  you see any parallels.
 
>> Bill Benson:  For our purposes, we'd like to just stayf ocused on his story, if  you don't m ind, 

if  that's ok.
 
>> 
O k.  
>> Bill Benson:  She was asking your thoughts about the world today compared to then.
 
>> David Bayer:  I have a lot of
 
--
 
I don't want to talk about it.W hy? I'm  abig critic of 
ever ything. If I start talking, I will c ritici ze halfthe world anywa y. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Ok.Let me just say this.W hen we f inish, David is going to stay uponthe 

stage. So if  anybody would liketo come up and ask another question, talk tohim a bitmore 

about anything, please feelf ree to do that there. I assure you, David has something to say 

about m ost everything.  
 
 
Any other qu

>> 
Hi, David. Back here. So muchof  what you said is so awful as itrelates to humanity.W hat 
you were able toovercom e is so inspiring. I was wondering, where did 
you 
f indthe strength to 
persist and to keep going?
 

>> B ill 
Benson:  David in light of  all you went through, where did youf ind your strengthtobe 

able to persist and keep going and survi ve? 
 

>> David Bayer: W hen I was working f or the irrigation canal outside m y hometown and stayed 

in the house, every tim e I walked outm y m other saidto m e, every day, she said tom e, " Don't 

forget you're a Jew,"  
d
on't change your religion, stay a Jew, die a Jew.
 
T hat's what ourfam ily 
was and is and shouldbe. AndI listenedtomy m other.I wanted to survi ve to show the world 

that
 
I am a Jew andI have fam ily.
 
 
T he reasonI didn'tm arr y in Panam a, after the war, nowhere is becauseI wanted to 
m arry a Jewish wom an and that's what Im arry. I wanted tohave afam ily, createafam ily that 

the Germans killed. My father was only 42 or43 years old. He was a religious m
a n b ut  yo un g.  I  

14
 
 
don't know how was re ligion after that. Maybe he change it. Maybe he realize Goddidn't listen
