JOHN DO LIBOIS 
 May 11, 2000 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Ambassador Dolibois, it™s 
a very nice to have you 
here in Washington. 
Answer: Thank you, it™s a pleasure to be here. 
Q: Tell me , what was your full name  at birth. 

A: We ll, actually, it was Jean, J-e-a-n. J
ean Ernest Dolibois, pronounced Dolibois in 
Luxembour g because it is a -- a French name . M y fath
er is Pa risian -- Parisian ancestry, so in -- 
in Europe it™s Dolibois. But Dolibois like Illinois 
in the United States, it makes it a lot easi er, so 

that™s just  a -- but a -- when I 
became naturalized, I paid a dollar 
extra for the naturalization fee, 
to change the Jean, J-e-a-n, which would be pr
onounced Jean, to John, J-
o-h-n. So at least my 
fi rst name is still a -- Americanized.  

Q: And tell me  what year you were born
 and where in Luxembourg you were born. 
A: I was born in Luxemb ourg City, actually a 
s-s -- the suburb Bonava, of Luxembour g City, on 
the avenue -- on the Rue de Chicago, predes
tination apparently. And the -- I was born on 
December fourth, 1918. My -- was imme
diately after -- shortly afte
r the signing of the armi stice 
and I was born the youngest of ei
ght children. Unfortunately my mo
ther died 10 days later. So 
my oldest sister Marie had to step in and -- a
nd play the role of my 
mother. And she actually 
raised me . In fact, up until the day she died, 
I called her mo m, you know, she was -- al-although 
she was my sister.  

Q: That™s interesting. 

A: But she actually is involved in my comi ng to
 the United States as an immigrant. I don™t know 
if you want to hear that -- 

Q: Yeah, I do, I do, yes, I kn --

A: -- roma ntic story, because it is that. We ll after World Wa r 
1
, we did have American 
occupation troops in Luxembourg be cause the Un
ited States -- the Americans had liberated 
Luxembour g from four years of occupation by th
e Germans. So there were American troops 
stationed in Luxembour g and some  Americans were
 billeted in our home . And as things would 
happen, my sister was 19 years ol
d, fell in love with one of the 
Americans, and they planned to 
get ma rried, if -- when he got out of the servi
ce. But then I wa s born, my mother died, and my 
sister had to take care of the 
rest of the fa mily and play the 
role of mother. So the American 
came back empty handed, but they corresponded with each ot her for 10 years. He came  back in 
1929 and married her and brought he
r to the United States, to Akron. Meanwhile my brothers 
and si -- brothers and sisters 
had all grown up and ma rried, and my
 father and I were all alone. 
So my father, who had pretty good political sens
e, and could look across 
the Mosselle river and 
see what was happening in Germany, 
and he didn™t see much of a futu
re for -- for me, at least, in 
Luxembour g, and he thought history could repeat it
self, so he decided we  ought to get out, come  
to the United States and take a
dvantage of the land of opportunity. And so my father and I came  
to the States in 1931 -- 

Q: Let me  a s k you -- 

A: -- and joined my sister now. 

Q: Uh-huh. It™s quite a stor
y about your sister -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- I must say, 10 years of correspondence that -- 

A: Right.

Q: -- I™m sure is a rare -- rare story. I -- I 
-- I understand from your autobiography that your -- 
your dad and you were quite different
 and your interest in education 
did not ma tch his interest, is 
that true? Was that  diffi cult? 

A: Yeah, my -- my father, who was a -- a very 
loving father and I respected him greatly, and -- 
and love him dearly, but he was not
 what we think of as a dad in the United States, there. There 
was no such thing as going to a ballgame  or ev
en going on vacation. I don™t remember  my father 
ever taking me on a vac ation trip
 or anything. He  worked -- he 
worked hard, he was in the 
construction business. But we had eight children
, I was the -- the youngest of the eight and my 

father had been quite successful in business. All 
of my brothers, with on
e exception, all worked 
for my father. They all went into the building tr
ade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and 

each one of them had a specialty and they worked
 in my father™s company. And naturally that™s 
what was in store for me . We ll, for some  reas
on or other I had different ideas, I™m -- I had 
ambitions. So when we came to the United States 
my father resisted my interest in having an 
education, and he -- he liked to poi
nt out that he never 
went to college, and he never even went to 
high school, and he was a success in life, why did 
I want to wa ste my time ?  And he had peculiar 
ideas, and -- you know. Don™t read so much, you™ll ge -- you™ll ruin your
 eyes. And he didn™t 
even want me to have a bi cycle because he said 
it was a useless article, y-
you pump your legs off 
to give your rear end a ride, you know. But he had 
very narrow views about that sort of thing. 
But strangely enough, when I insisted and followed 
my own path, he was the first one to step up 
front and point with pride. And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in school. He  -- he 

took upon himself to let everybody know that -- when 
I became  a valedictorian in high school, he 
-- he patted himself on the b
ack, too, it™s 
-- it™s a --

Q: Do you think he was frightened
 in some  way of the difference 
that -- how you we re different 
from -- 
A: Of -- that™s absolute --  that ™s absolutely ri
ght, he -- he -- he never 
adapted. And he ma de the 
sacrifice, comi ng to the United States, for my 
sake. And I™ve always given him credit for that. 
But he never assimilated. He never wanted to be part
 of the -- he -- he didn
™t even bother to learn 
the language. He wanted to just rema in what -- 
what he was. And proud of it. But -- and so I 
didn™t fit that pattern, right, I 
created a pattern of my own. And 
naturally, with his old fashioned, 
basically European viewpoint, he 
just didn™t -- didn™t see that. 
He couldn™t agree with that. I 
mean, we didn™t have any arguments about it, but
 he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da -- 
you don™t need to do that, I neve
r did it, look at me. And -- 
Q: And did your sister suppor
t your -- your doing what -- 
A: Oh yeah, she -- as mu ch as poss -- but I had to
 be pretty mu ch on my 
own, because I -- I was -
- ma de perfectly clear that I wasn™t going to sponge off of my  sister and her family. She had her -
- her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline. 
And -- so it was still pos
sible to do it in the 
Uni t e d St at es - - 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me  it was. 

Q: Did your dad work when he came over here, or did he stop working? 

A: We ll, he wa -- he was real
ly -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was 
concerned. But he did work around the neighbo
rhood. He would, you know, repair things for -- 
for people and do some  small building jobs and that
 sort of thing, and -- but we sold our fa mily 
home stead -- our family home , and my father c
ould pretty much live on that. He -- he was up in 

years, he was a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- see, well it™s the 50 -- he 
was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather. 
Q: 1872. Right, so he wasn™t such a young -- 

A: So, he was retired.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And so. But he did ma nage to keep busy 
around the neighborhood and 
-- in Akron and earn 
some  pocket money and so forth, but there wa
s never a -- never any want, I me an -- 
Q: So he never learned English? 

A: No, no.  

Q: Intere sting. 

A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable] 

Q: He never learned English? 

A: No, no, it -- he could -- he™d read
 the paper, at least he pretende
d to read, and he kept pretty 
much informed of what ™s going on. But there was a 
German church in -- in Akron that he went 
to. At least one sermon was preached in German in
 Saint Bernard church, I recall. So he kept up 
his contacts that way, and he subscribed to a 
-- a Luxembour g paper and a German pa per. He 
could read German. Although he was born in f -- in France, his French was not very good. He 

was primarily Germanic because hi s family had m
oved from Paris to the Saar Basin, at the time 
that Saar was still a pa rt of France. 

Q: Right. 

A: Of course, the Saar went back and forth 
and one time German, then it was independent, and 
then it was again part of France. So in the S
aar almost everybody spoke French and Ge rman, too.  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
6 
 
A: But my father primarily spoke 
the Saar dialect, which is very close to the Luxembourg patois. 
Q: Did you like -- did you like the idea of comi
ng to the United States?  Were you happy about 
that? 
A: We ll, I think -- you know, I 
wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at Luxembourg were 
American movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson. And the idea of 

cowboys and Indians appealed to me . There™s an
 author that every boy 
in -- in Luxembourg, and 
for that ma tter, I think in western Europe reads 
as a boy and those are a se
ries of novels about the 
American Indians and cowboys, written by Karl
 May. And everybody has read Karl May, as I 
did. And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life 
was like in United Stat es. 
That part appealed to 
me  very mu ch, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, 
and the idea of also leaving all my friends, 

and the culture that I was used to in Luxem
bour g, that created some  problems, so I had a 
conflict. I was excited in one way, and another 
wa y a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it. So 
the -- I didn™t wa nt to leave, so -- 
Q: Wh- Whe n you came here in ™31, it™s two year
s prior to the Nazis taking over in Germany. 
When they take over in Germany, does that imp
act you at all?  I mean, you™re still European in 
some  way, so the consciousness of what™s going on in Europe -- 

A: Oh, I think I was too young to be
 aware of -- of rea
lly what was going on. I don™t think that I 
became particularly interested in what was happ
ening. Wa  -- once we got to the States, I did, I 
think, what I now think every immi grant should 
do. First of all concentrate on learning the 
language, and I -- I couldn™t speak a word of Eng
lish, so I had work pretty hard, because I went 
to school, public school, and they imme diately sent 
me  back two years. I should have been in the 
eighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, bu
t before that I -- they put me  in kindergarten. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
7 
 
And here I am 13 years old, and I™m in kindergar
ten, the biggest boy in cl
ass, but that was the 
only advantage. But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in 
kindergarten and then a couple of mo re months 
in the third grade. A
nd then moved me  up to, 
finally, the sixth grade, and I went on from th
ere. But I think I concentrated on becomi ng a Boy 
Scout, and becomi ng Americanized, 
and I -- I loved the Boy Scout 
experience. That contributed 
a great deal to my Americaniza
tion. And learning the language wa
s -- was a challenge. And as I 
say, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential 
to become  a part of the American scene, you 

know, you should. So I didn™t -- I rea
lly sort of forgot all about 
Luxembourg and -- to the point 
where even corresponding with my friends beca
me  secondary and I didn™t do much of it any 
more. That all came back later, see. 

Q: Right. But all of your brothers and sisters,
 except for Marie, are 
-- are in Luxembourg. 
A: One more brother had come  to Chicago. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I had a brother in Chicago, my br other Ted. 
And my sister Marie in Akron. All the others 
were -- were back in Luxembourg. 
Q: So was there some  concern then, when the war started in ™39 -- 

A: Very mu ch so, and of course, after the wa
r started, there wa s no communication, and no ma il, 
we couldn™t get any. After the -- the Germans oc
cupied Luxembourg, ma il 
service to the United 
States was just unheard of. The only way -- 
I think once or twice we did get some  
communication from one of my 
brothers, because some body who 
was going to another country, 
mailed a letter for him, I -- I do recall my -- my 
fa ther getting a letter 
once from my br other 
Heinrich that way. But there was no communicati
on. N-No such thing as transatlantic telephone 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
8 
 
calls, and -- and the ma il service was nonexisten
t. But there th -- ther
e™s definitely a -- a 
cessation of communication. There wa s just 
no -- no way of being in touch, so --  
Q: So when did you gra -- you gradua
ted high school when, in ™38, ™39? 
A: 1938. 
Q: ™38?  

A: Yes. Akron -- Akron North High School. That -- 

Q: So then the question is w-well now what?  Becau
se now you have to pave the way for the next 
step [indecipherable] 

A: Well, I had -- as I say, I ha
d pretty much made up my mi nd
, and -- and -- and this is a -- 
again, the -- the a -- the hero worship that we™r
e all guilty of in our youth, and I had picked my 
hero. He was a scout executive, a camp director
. My favorite place in the United States as a boy 
was the scout camp, Ca mp Manatoc in Akron, Oh
io, that I attended re
gularly. In fact, I 
reme mber my junior year in high 
school, I spent more nights at cam
p than I did in my own bed at 
home . But I loved Camp Manatoc, an -- an --
 an ideal boy scout camp, and the ma n who was 
camp director of it, was just the 
-- he was my idol. He was the 
kind of ma n I wanted to be in 
every way. Tall, and handsome and -- and a beautiful singing voice, a sp
eaking voice. A lot of 
personality and that is what I wanted to be li
ke. And I decided I would be a professional scout 
executive so I could be like Mr. Jo
sselle and follow in that -- that
 pattern. So naturally that meant 
an education and going to college, and my a mb
ition was to get a college degree and go into 

professional scouting. And I had the audacity at that time  to write to the chief scout executive, 

Dr. James E. West, I recall at th
at time, professional scout exec
utive. And they answered my 
letter, and we  started up a correspondence. He 
s -- sort of became my 
-- my mentor by mail, 
encouraging me  on what to study in high school
 and college and preparing myself for  a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408

professional career in scouting. So that was my 
idea. Well, at scout camp I met some of the 
younger leaders, who were students at Miami Univ
ersity. And there was al
so one who was a -- a 
graduate of Washington and Jefferson College in
 Wa shington, Pennsylvania. And both of these 
interests, they started recruiting me  for their pa
rticular institution. And I 
did get a scholarship at 
Washington and Jefferson. And it was worth a lot more
 financially than another scholarship I had 
at Miami University, so I deci
ded to go to Wa shington and Jeffe
rson. And I would graduate and 
then go to the Schiff scout reserv
ation and become a professional
 scout executive. That was my 
ambition. Then I fell in love and -- during 
the summer of 1938, I me t the young lady whom I 
subsequently ma rried. And we decided during our 
summer roma nce that we would go to college 
together. And that meant going to a co-educational school. So -- 
Q: You switched. 

A: Wa shington and Jefferson was a ma le school, a
ll ma le. So I ended up taking the scholarship 
from Miami University because then we can go together. 
Q: Right. 
A: That wasn™t the only reason. Miami also 
had a good reputation, was a good school and there 
were a lot of alumni who influenced me  at 
scout camp. So we ma de a very happy choice. And 
we both enrolled at Miami University and went
 all through college t
ogether, four years. 
Q: And wha t  were you studying there? 

A: Oh, I ma jored in psychology, again at Dr. We
s t ™s suggestion. As a scout executive he thought 
psychology ought to be my ma jor because it™s wo
rking with people, understanding people, and 
working with scouts and the whole leadership 
concept, so I ma jored in psychology for that 

particular reason, so -- 

Q: Which became very fortuitous for you later on when [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
10 
 
A: Yeah, came -- s-served me -- it served me very well -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- later on too, see, Pa rticular
 at -- it tied in as part of my
 pattern of circles into what 
eventually did happen during the war and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- my career in the military and afterwards, so -- 

Q: Now, by the time  you™re at the universit
y, you™re a young ma n, you™re in love and having a 
rela -- a relationship. Are you now much more consci
ous of the war in -- in an everyday way? 
A: Oh yes, th-the -- the mi nute wore broke out we  became very conscious of it. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And of c ourse we were in school, we were
 in -- you know, in an education institution and I 
was taking a lot of courses that involved curren
t events and development in Europe. And then 
because of my European connection, I really we nt 
into that as a -- I became an avid follower of 
the news, of what was happening in -- in -- 
in Luxembourg particularly after the Germans 
invaded Luxe mbourg. You know, after all, they
 were invading my home land. Now I became 

very much concerned and followed it very closel
y. And I think what -- what added to the -- the 
stimulus there was not being able to communicat
e with anybody in Luxem
bourg, and that sort of 
added an extra challenge, or pi
zzazz to the whole relationshi p. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I was very conscious of what 
was going on in Europe by then, so -- 
Q: We re there courses on the rise of Nazism, 
on th-the kind of society, 
or -- or was it too soon 
for that sort  of thing? 

A: Much too soon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
11 
 
Q: Much too soon. 
A: Actually, a -- an-and this is some thing that  -- th
at really struck me  during the war and after the 
war and now, in retrospect, how very little we 
knew about what was going on in Germany. We 
really -- from the in -- the military intel
ligence st andpoint  and the political intelligence 
standpoint, we had no idea what Nazism was all a
bout, I mean the headlines, nothing in depth. 
And much of what we did learn, scratchy as it 
was -- sketchy as it was, was written off as 
propaganda. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, it™s the sort of thing we  --we said about the Germans in World Wa r 
1
. And you 
know, there were the America [indecipherable] w
ho were very active in the early stage, 1939 - 

1940, before Pearl Harbor and before we got involve
d. And there was this f
eeling of this is not 
our war, this is none of our business, and -- so 
what little we did know that could be introduced 
in a hist ory class or  political science class was 
either propaganda or as I sa y, was on the surface, 
nothing really in depth. And it wasn™t, until we 
got involved in the war, and began to ma ke 
personal contact with prisoners of war, and with 
German government offi cials, that we began to 
become  awa r e of what Nazism is all about. And th
is is what ma de my own assignment such a big 
challenge. We were pioneering in
 military intelligence work. 
Q: So tell me , when -- le-let me  just go back a little bit, although I™m tr
ying to figure out how old 
you were. In 1938, when Kristallnacht happens in 
Germany and there™s all these riots and 30,000 
pe -- Jews are put into -- a
rrested, do you hear about this? 
A: No. 

Q: You don™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
12 
 
A: What -- what we did here, as I say, was 
-- was very sketchy. Re me mb er now, we were no 
longer allowi ng refugees to come  to United States. 
Q: Right. 

A: We actually turned th
em a way, as you know, which I think is
 one of the -- the dark sides in 
American history. But no German i mmigrants ca
me to the United Stat es after the -- the war 
began. And -- and after Nazism, when the German
s starting working on a final solution. So the 
information we had, as I say, was -- was very inco
mplete and a lot of it was written off as -- as 
propaganda. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: We  -- we really didn™t know 
-- Kristallnacht, that could be 
a perfectly good propaganda story. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A-And so what?  So they were going around 
breaking windows, who cared?  We  -- we didn™t 
really take any of that seriously, unfortunately. 
Q: Did you hear about the Nazi Olympics in ™3
6, and the issue of should Jewish boys go -- go 
over and participate, or not? 
A: D-During the 1936 -- 

Q: 1936. 

A: -- Olymp i c? 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: Oh yes, well of course, we were ve
ry excited about our own Jesse Owens -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and -- and proud of that. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
13 
 
A: But that was -- that really had nothing to do w
ith the politics of it as far as we as young people 
are concerned -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- in other words, gee, our boy won -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and so one of our -- one of our guys ma de 
it. And we didn™t relate 
that to the philosophy of 
Nazism versus democracy or -- or anything else, no, no.  

Q: So tell me , you -- 

A: We  were quite naïve. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You both -- you graduated and go
t ma rried in 1942, is that right? 
A: We -- we got married first. 
Q: First. 
A: Which -- you know, Miami University, like ma
ny other institutions, Miami University is a 
state institution and very strict regulations. I re
me mber when we started going to college, my 
freshman ye ar boys and girls didn™t ev
en sit together at a football game . 
Q: Really? 

A: I mean, we had a woma n™s section and a me n™
s section. And that changed during the course 
of my freshman year. But there wa
s a lot of strict regul
ation. Girls had to be 
in at 11 o™clock at 
night on Fridays, 10 o™clock during the week. No 
telephone calls after 10 o™
clock, or before three 
o™clock in the afternoon. It was ve
ry rigid. The idea of two student
s being ma rried to each other 
and going to school at Miami University was -- th
at just didn™t exist. 
Well, then came Pearl 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
14 
 
Harbor, in December ™40 -- 1941, and I -- I felt -- I -- 
I really felt that I wanted -- not only would 
get involved, but wanted to
 get involved. And so I signed up for the navy, a special 
[indecipherable] program. I was going to go in th
e navy and get -- when I graduated, and through 
[indecipherable] program I could go
 to a special training school a
nd graduate as an ensign in the 
navy and that would be the natural thing for me
 t o do. So we knew that was going to happen, and 
if that™s the case, then we wanted to get marri
ed before I left. So th
e university had, meanwhile, 
changed the rules after Pearl Harbor and ma ny of 
the students who wanted to get ma rried, could. 
Now we wer e  the first to sign up. So in January 17
th
, 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, a little 
over, we got ma rried on the weekend in Oxfor
d. I reme mber our classes were dismissed. Our 
professors came  to our wedding. We
 still have a -- a film of a -- of our wedding that my father-
in-law took, and -- of all my pr
ofessors comi ng to our wedding, 
including the pr
esident of the 
university and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Upha m. 
And they gave us speci
al permission to get 
ma rried. And we started it and then
 of course there were others 
who did the same  thing. We ll, as 
it turned out, I didn™t get that navy program b
ecause I hadn™t been a naturalized citizen long 
enough. You -- you -- and I don™t know if the navy st
ill has that rule, but you could not become  
an officer in the navy, air force or ma rines, unless you™d been a American citizen 10 years. You 

could be an officer in the army, but not in 
the other branches. So 
I had gone through all the 
procedures of joining this [ind
ecipherable] program when they 
decided I hadn™t been a citizen 
long enough and didn™t qualify. So I just conti
nued my course. Then th
e draft board got me . 
Naturally, and we expected that. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they put me  in one B. That was a -- 
one A were drafted imme
diately, one B you were 
postponed because you were in school, or -- and I 
had a slight  vision pr oblem in my left eye, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
15 
 
which I didn™t even know about. So they classifi
ed me one B, which mea nt we could get married 
-- we could graduate. We were ma
rried, we could graduate. So we 
actually graduated in June of 
1942. And meanwhile I got a job with Proctor 
and Ga mble in Cincinnati, and we set up 
housekeeping in Cincinnati. And then in Nove
mber of ™42, one B number came up and my 
postponeme nt -- postponement had ended. So on Nove mber 13
th
, 1942, I got the word, you 
know, you™re now in the army. So that change
d everything, so we we
re ready to go. We 
anticipated it all along, just 
a ma tter of time, you know. And be
lieve it or not, you know, I was 
drafted, but I really was eager to
 go. I felt I™d benefited so mu ch
 and -- and I don™t have a false 
sense of patriotism, it™s very genuine. I really 
thought I wanted to serv
e and at the same time 
there was a relationship with -- I 
wanted to help liberate Luxem
bourg, so there™s a little bit of 
that entere d into it as well, so it 
was a -- a mutual, satisfying agreement. 
Q: So do you go first to basic training? 
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Basic training. 

Q: How basic was it? 

A: We ll, th-that, of course, is a -- you know, 
every once in awhile I ma -- I™m making a  speech 
and -- and I have a lot of fun 
explaining how I actually ended up 
where I eventually did. But I 
know when I was inducted at Fort Thomas, Ke
ntucky, and a -- a -- a young personnel officer, I 
think was a corporal or a PFC asked me  what 
I could do, and I told him I could speak German 
fluently and I™d like to get into -- into military
 intelligence. And his answer, ﬁWell did you ever 
drive a truck? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, but I can
 speak German fluently.ﬂ I wasn
™t going to give up so easily. 
But he wanted to know if I could drive a bus or 
a tractor, or -- or plow with some thing heavy, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
16 
 
with air brakes, and -- an
d no I didn™t qualify for any of that. 
But by that time my minute and a 
half was over, and I ended up being sent to Fort
 Knox, Kentucky to be a ta
nk driver. That™s what 
they needed that particular da
y. So I started my career in the 
army being trained to be a tank 
driver. I was in the armo red force, armored for
ce replacement training center at Fort Knox. So I 
learn how to drive a heavy vehicle in the armore
d force, even a motorcycle, which I hated. But 
the big trucks and armored cars and tanks; fired 
every weapon from a revolver on up to the big 
Howitzers and, you know, it™s kind of
 exciting, right? I -- I -- I kind of liked it. So, after I 
finished my basic training, I di
d have a college degree, the army
 decided I was officer material. 
So I became one of those 90 day wonders. I went  to officer™s candidate school and after 90 days 
at Fort Knox, I got a commi ssion as a second li
eutenant. And incidenta
lly got my commission 
from General George S. Patton, Jr. Ge neral Pa
tton was the commence ment speaker when I -- I 

graduated. And my commission was in mechani
zed cavalry, and since Patton was a cavalry 
general, he pinned a cavalry insi
gnia on the -- the me mbers of my 
class who were taken into the 
mechanized cavalry, there were 10 of us -- 10 of
 us. So I thought that was a -- a good beginning 
of my career. Course Patton wasn™t
 as famous then as -- as he subsequently became, but -- 
Q: Can you explain what mechanized cavalry is? 

A: We ll, you know, the horse cavalry. 

Q: Right. 

A: We ll, during World War 
11
, we™re -- we™re now -- 
Q: [indecipherable] horses. 

A: -- mechanized cavalry, and the mechanized ca
valry is light -- light  
tanks and fast moving 
vehicles, Jeeps, light tanks a
nd light armored cars, half trac
ks, actually. And the mechanized 
cavalry is used for reconnaissance. They™re in th
e forefront, they™re reconn
oitering th-the terrain 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
17 
 
and enemy s t rength. So reconnaissance is the --
 the spearhead of an armo red division, and 
armored division, of course, are your heavy 
guns and your heavy tanks, and you have your c-
cavalry reconnaissance for the lead, to explore th
e territory ahead, so -- and that was the purpose 
of the mechanized cavalr
y. I was assigned to the 23
rd
 cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 16
th
 
armored division, Camp Chaffee, Ar kansas. So af
ter I got my commission, that was my first 
military assignment, in Arkansas, 16
th
 armored division, so -- then, m
onths later, the army found 
out I could speak Germa n. 
Q: It finally got to them. 

A: And that ties into what  -- what I said earlier.
 We were ready to invade North Africa and we 
were going to begin to ma ke our first eyeball to
 eyeball contact with 
the enemy and it suddenly 
occurred to some body here in Wa shington that g
ee, you know, what are we going to talk to them 
about?  And who™s going to do the talking?  We  ha
dn™t thought of setting up ike -- IPW teams, or 
counterintelligence teams, or -- we
 hadn™t even thought of
 military gov
ernment, in case we won 
the war. So all of a sudden the lights went on 
and they decided we got to round up all the people 

who can speak German. So regardless of wh
ere you belonged, or regardless of what your 

background was, if you spoke Germa n, you -- you got 
yanked into military intelligence. And just 

a -- a cry went out, order went 
out, cooks, bakers, quarterma sters,
 even some  medical personnel, 
all put in the military intelligence. 

Q: Hm. 

A: And we were sent to Ca mp 
Richie, Camp Richie, Maryland, 
which is the Maryland National 
Guard camp, about 90 miles north 
of Washington. And that became 
the secret training center for 
military intelligence personnel. And 
that™s where I ended up on very short notice, from Arkansas 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
18 
 
to Camp Richie, Maryland. So I was transferred fro m the armo red force to military intelligence. 
And my spe c ialty then wa-was interrogating prisone rs of war. That™s what I was trained to do. 

Q: How ma ny of you were sent there [indeci
pherable] Richie, Maryland, do you think? 
A: Oho, that is a -- you know, i-if I were 
younger and had the ambition, I™d write another book 

and I -- I would just write about Camp Richie, be
cause that wa s the most fascinating place. You 
could -- there was a poem that a very intelligent 
military intelligence offi cer wrote, and it starts 
out, was you ever at Camp Richie, the [indeciphe
rable] of all, where the sun come s up like 
[indecipherable] recorded bugle ca
ll. And that™s the way the poem starts out. You could hear 
every language under the sun spoken at Camp Ri
chie, Maryland. And they brought in people -- 
not just German speaking, French, Italian, 
Arabic, everything. You -- you -- we had a 
conglomeration of people. And quite a few, includ
ing quite a few Jewish refugees who had come  
to the United States earlier, who 
had been taken into the army , they were all sent to Camp Richie 
because they were the only ones who could speak fluent German still. And they were the ideal 
military government and military in
telligence personnel. Their -- their f -- their German was 
fluent. There were very few a -- a that type of
 German speaking military personnel availabl e. So 
most of the others were people who had studied
 German in s c hool, or ma jored in German in 
college, or had German parents who spoke German 
at home. But the real fluent German speaker 
-- and a lot of our intelligent offi cers were -- were
 Jewish. My colleagues at
 -- that I lived with 
were all refugee families who had come to thes
e United Stat es early, in the 30™s, with their 
fa milies. So all these people were thrown togeth
er  and they ha d diffe rent sections, ther e were 
eight sections all together, and I 
was in section five, that was th
e IPW section. But there were the 
CIC, the counter-intelligence, there was the 
photo interpretation, the photo intelligence, people 
who studied aerial photos and -- andcould ma ke sense out of -- out of
 that particular effort. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
19 
 
th-there were the OSS people, and ha-hand to ha
nd combat people who worked behind the lines, 
the forerunner of the CIA. We  -- we trained 
them in everything, and we had regular German 
prisoners of war, the very first who had been
 taken in North Africa were brought to Camp 
Richie. And the -- we -- you know, we had 
a chance to practice first hand -- 
Q: I was going to -- 
A: -- with real German prisoners. So it was a --  
a very exciting place. Wh at we taught then was 
German ar my organization, which we knew nothi
ng about. Na tional Socialism, which we knew 

very little about. All the paramilitary organiza
tions under the Hitler regime , we didn™t know what 
the NSKK was, or the NSFK, th
e National Socialist Fl ying Corps, National Soci alist Motor 
Corps. This was the paramilitary that the Hitler
 regime  had organized. These people were getting 
subtle military training by belonging to the truck 
driver™s corps, or the flyi ng corps, but they 
were being prepared for military. So there were 
a lot of those. Germany was limited to a hundred 
thousand ma n army, but bor -- by the time Hitler was 
ready to invade Poland, he had more than a 
hundred thousand me n, I mean, well trained from
 the Hitler youth on up. We  didn™t know that. 
We had to learn about all these 
things. We  learned about the char
acteristics and 
the personalities 
of the high ranking Nazis; we knew nothing about 
them. If you™ve heard of the film, ﬁTriumph 
des Willensﬂ, that was our -- our text -- o-our textbook, I should say. Every Thursday I recall, all 

the classes -- the German classes were brought toge
ther in a theater at -- 
at Camp Ric hie, and we 

showed Leni Riefenstahl™s, ﬁTriumph des Willens,ﬂ a three hour documentary of a Nuremberg 

rally. And that was the only docume ntary film, 
and the only photographic evidence we had of the 
Nazi leaders, like Hess, and Goering, and Stryke
r, and Lie, and seeing them perfor m in this, 
ﬁTriumph des Willens,ﬂ in this film, was the only way that our -- our trainees could learn 

anything about what these Nazis even looked like. Th
at was the beginning of it, and that™s all we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
20 
 
had to go on. So our training was some what pr
imitive. We had limited intelligence,really, 
because we hadn™t done much over there in 
the way of gathering information, so -- 
Q: So who were -- who were the teachers?  We re th
ey historians, or were they mil -- another set 
of military intelligence people? 

A: They were -- they were people like me . For 
instance, the course la
sted two months, and 
during that time  you learned or-order battle and 
German ar my, all the th
ings that I mentioned. 
Then you were sent overseas as a me mber of an
 IPW tea m, which consisted of two officers and 
three or four enlisted me n, all trained at Rich
ie. And you would go overseas and be assigned to a 

division, or -- or a regime
nt, or even an army group, or an ar
my, as interrogator and when those 
units advanced and took prisone
rs, the IPW tea m in
terrogated them. So Ca mp Richie was 
feeding all these interrogators a
nd other intel-telligence personnel 
to the different divisions as 
fast as we could produce them. We l l , every once 
in awhile there™d be a graduate like me , who 
also had pretty good trai
ning -- [phone ringing] 
Q: Excuse me  [indecipherable] stop?  Are we ok
ay? I™m sorry, I didn™t 
unplug the phone. They 
should know when to call back here.  
A: Changing film?  

Q: No, there was a f -- the f -- the 
-- the telephone rang, for some  reason. 
A: Oh, oh.  

Q: Can you find the plug?  That™s -- you™re having
 trouble [indecipherable]. 
All right, we™re back 
fr om our little interr uptions. You were talking about -- 

A: Yeah, well, there were people like me  -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
21 
 
A: -- with -- with a -- a colle
ge education, and particularly
 a psychology ma jor, which was 
exactly the sort of thing they wanted. To interr
ogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a 
little bit of a psychological back
ground -- the -- fr om the technique
 of it. And then the German 
language. But th-the military training I had gave
 me an advantage overthose who came from the 
quarterma ster corps, or the cooks and bakers sch
ool, and -- or some  other branch of the service 

which was not as military as techni ca l. So I became a teacher. And I started trai ning ot hers, 

instead of going overseas as a me mb er of an IP
W team, I became one of the -- the staff me mbers 
in section five. Our commanding officer was the 
colonel, Colonel Wa rndorf, and the -- the other 
teachers in that section, in the German section we
re gradua tes of the Richie school who had been 
picked because they had specific background that 
ma de good teachers of them. So they were the 
ones who were teaching others. By then we were
 also getting not just people that  we were 
training in interrogation, but we 
were also getting ge
neral officers and field grade officers from 
military divisions in the country and also some
 fr om units already overseas, who were brought 
back to get so me special training in military
 intelligence, particul
arly aerial photos and 
interrogation and -- and or
der of battle, German army organi
zation, that sort of thing. So our 
students were not only in a German
 section IPW me mbers, they were also what we call the S2 
and G2 offic e rs of different divisions. So I was 
a second lieutenant and a lot of my students were 
general officers, who were the G2 of their division
s, who came for their special traini ng course at 
Ca mp Richie. It was a very exciting, a very inte
resting time. And our staff sergeant at the -- in 
section five, for instance, was Wa lter Schneider. 
Walter Schneider was an 
assist ant manager the 
Waldorf- Astoria. Our chef in the me ss hall a-at  Ca
mp Richie was a chef from one of the leading 
-- I forget which -- hotel of -- of Ne w York or 
Boston, but he was a super chef and the food was 
superb. It was served on me tal trays, but 
it was wonderful. It was gourme t food. The food was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
22 
 
superb because the people we brought in to Richie
, we -- were special -- 
specialists in different 
fields, including cooks and bake
rs. So -- so we had the best. 
Q: Wo w. 

A: Cu -- they could also speak German, so that helped also. 

Q: Tell me , in th -- in the training, in your cour
ses, when -- when you were being taught, were 
people talking about the Holocaust at
 all, about the murder of Jews? 
A: No. 

Q: None?  

A: No, no, very -- 

Q: So it was the structure of National Socialism, and the st ruct ure of the military, etcetera? 

A: Yeah, it -- mostly military based, because th
at™s what we were interest ed in getting 
information about. 

Q: I see. 
A: They -- the Holocaust  and the atrocities as-assoc
iated with the Nazi regime  was not part of the 
military. 
Q: Right. 

A: Wi  -- we really didn™t know too much about it
. A lot of that didn™t be gin to develop until we 

started invading Germa ny and liberati
ng camps and saw what was going on. 
Q: Now the Jewish boy, I ga -- thes
e are all men in the -- in Camp 
Richie, yes?  The -- the Jewish 
fellows that you me t, who had 
experience with the Nazis -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- did you talk to them and find out things? 

A: Oh yeah, yes, now that was -- but 
that was not part of the training. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
23 
 
Q: I understand. 
A: That would be a personal relationship. 

Q: Right. 

A: And frankly, you take a lot of that with a 
grain of salt, and you say, well, you know, that 
sounds like propaganda. That™s supposed to ma ke us
 hate the Germans. Is it really true?  And you 
had to really get to know the people and once you ha
d their -- they had your confidence, then you 
began to realize there™s some thing to this. Bu
t that came much later, really. I know oh, golly, 
name s like Watson, Landauer, Daniels, Verna Daniel
s, Viel. These are all Jewish colleagues of 
mi ne, and much of what they knew is hearsay, se
cond hand information. So that was not part of 
the official development or tr
aining at all. That wa s -- that
 was talk. You know, was just 
some body r e  -- reciting a story that he had hear
d from some body else, about some body. Ya -- ya 
-- you know, as I say, we  -- we had no refugees. Nobody who had been in a concentration camp 

came to Germany -- I mean, came fr om Ger many 
to the United States, not at that time. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean, that -- that ™s all post-war. 

Q: Right. 

A: So we really were, as I say, very naïve. 
Probably no one was more surprised -- and I speak 
first hand knowledge -- at the atro
ci ties or the things that they 
saw than some  of our commanding 
generals, like Eisenhower and -- 
and Bradley, as our units adva
nced, and the advancing troops 
would liberate a camp and then generals like Ei
senhower and -- and others would come and see 
for the fi rst time. And that™s the fi rst tim
e they heard of some  of these things.  
Q: Or, what you™re saying is that they hear
d of them, and they thought it was propaganda. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
24 
 
A: That -- yeah, didn™t believe it, it -- it was, 
you know, we went back to first World War, and 
the Germans were mutilating nuns and that ki nd of stories you heard. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: See, but that™s necessary in war. You have
 to -- you have to ma ke propaganda in order to 
ma ke you ha te the enemy and fight him. 
So it was taken with a grain of salt. 
Q: So you saw the w -- the war -- I don™t want to sa
y it was sort of a natura
l war, but it was -- it 
was just a wa r. These were the enemy -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- and they happened to be a big enemy. 

A: They were -- we™re looking at it fr -- 

Q: They™re just a -- 

A: -- yeah, we™re looking at strictly fr om the military st andpoint -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- you know?  We  just -- the rest of
 it really was -- came much later -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- much to our surprise. 

Q: Right. So how long do you stay in Ca mp Rich
ie?  This i -- til ni 
-- yeah, how long are you 
there? You go there when? 

A: Yeah, the training co
urse is two months. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then you were 
immediately shipped out. 

Q: Right. But you weren™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
25 
 
A: But -- but I stayed another 10 months beyond 
that. Meanwhile, we had -- when I was assigned 
to the 16
th
 armored division at Camp Chaffee, Ar kans
as, that was a brand 
new division, and I 
was a cavalry officer, in other words I -- we were
 training people for th
at division. So I knew I 
would be in Arkansas at least 
two years before I go overseas. So we decided now is the time to 
have a family. Then when my wife was nine m
onths pregnant, one week
 before our firstborn 
child was due, I was transferred to military intelligence. Boom. And that -- that  was a big 
surprise. Now everything changed. Well, Wi nni e, my 
wife, decided I at least 
had -- had to see the 

baby. So a week before Johnny Mike was due, she got
 permission from her doctor in Arkansas to 
ma ke the trip and she came  from For t  Smith, 
Arkansas, to Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania by 
train, on a troop train. Arrived on 
a Monday, and our Mike was bor
n the Sunday of that week, 
Mother™s day, 56 years ago this Sunday. He was born in Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania, so -- 

and we had to decide whether 
Mike would be -- whether Wi nnie would be taken to the hospital 
in Wa ynesboro, Pennsylvania, which is near Bl
ueridge Summit, or Hage
rstown. And the doctor 
on Sunday morning decided Wa yne sboro, so our Mi
ke was born north of the Mason-Dixon line. 

But if Dr. Bridges had decided to go to Hagersto
wn, we™d have had a southerner in our fa mily. 
Q: Right. 

A: Cause Blueridge Summit is right on the Mason-
Dixon line, so -- so -- but -- so now we had a 
baby and I was at Richie for 10 mo nths, so I was ab
le to see our child at 
least up til the age of -- 
of 10 months. 

Q: So did Winnie then come  a
nd live with you in Ca mp Richie? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: We ll, she came to Camp Richie
, yes, an-and that™s where -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
26 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- we lived in Blueri dge Summit -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Ca mp  Ri chie was -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- right about a mile from Blueridge Su
mmit, and we lived in Blueridge Summit, 

Pennsylvania, it™s right on the border of Maryla
nd and Pennsylvania. And when -- and then when 
I was shipped overseas, she went hom
e to Akron with the baby, you know -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and lived with her sister who also had a hus
band in the army, so the two sisters kept house. 
Q: [indecipherable] right. So you™re shipped out 
of the United States in April of 1945, is that 
right? 

A: Right, right. 
Q: And do you know your destination? 
A: No, that was all --  that wa
s top secret. I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was 

going. We  l e ft out of Camp Kil mer, New York on
 a troop train -- troop -- on 
the troop ship. That 
was the -- the Ile de France, a l
uxury liner which had been conve
rted into a -- a troop ship. And 
we went from New York then to Greenark, Scotla
nd and from there by trai
n all the way south to 
Southampton, England. And then by ferry boat, actu
ally, ferry steamer acro
ss the channel into Le 
Havre and then by troop train from Le Havre, even
tually to Paris after doing a lot of zigzag-ing 
because some body gotten our orders me ssed up, we were -- ended up in the wrong place, and the 

ship back to Paris. Then I was in Paris about fi
ve days, in La Vaisamé, which was the temporary 
headquarters of military intelligence in Paris at 
that particul ar point. And then I was assigned to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
27 
 
the 6824 DIC. 6824 detailed interrogation center. No
w here I have to distinguish between the 
regular IPW team that I me ntioned earlier. Th
eir function was to get tactical information. 
Tactical meaning what™s going on across the river, 
or what unit is our unit facing. Wh en are they 
planning to attack, how strong are th
ey. That™s t-tactics. We  were al
so interested now, at this late 
stage of the game in strategic 
information. Again, we want to know more about do the Germans 
have the atom bomb?  What™s this V1 and V2 busin
ess?  Chemical bacterial 
warfare. All of those 
things we knew nothing about. 
That was strategic informati
on, and we call that detailed 
interrogation. So we had a center 
in the Ardens in northern Fran
ce, [indecipherable] way up the 
point where the Mers river goes into Belgium an
d then come s back down, we were there in a 
hunting lodge. And we™d taken over this little town
 of Revan. We were billeted in private homes 
and -- and used a hunting lodge for our work
ing area. And we brought prisoners who had 
strategic information, like genera
l officers, me mbers of the German generals staff. Chemists, 
scientists, physicists, working 
on the V1, V2. Anybody who had informa tion at a strategic, high 
political  level, we would bring to this -- take
n prisoner along the battlefields anywhere, we 
would bring to this detailed 
interrogation center for strategic infor mation. Some  of the m we 
would find would have such valuable information 
that we bring them to the States. Now we had 
a very secret place, whose name  I still don™t know
, right he re in Wa shington, where we brought 
German prisoners of war who knew inside info
rmation on a very high ranking -- well, anyhow, 
my assignment was a really exciting one. I wa
s given a Jeep and a 
driver, and orders by 
command of General Eisenhower, I could go anywhe
re I wanted to go. And my job was to go 
wherever there were pr isoners
, which was now everywhere.  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
28 
 
A: And screen prisoners that we
 thought mi ght have this kind of
 strategic infor mation. A lot of 
German generals put on enlisted men™s uniforms a
nd were taken prisoner as
 ordinary corporals 
and privates, but they were really general officer
s. So we had to find that kind of people, and 
those who were scientists and -- and had this kind
 of infor ma tion we wanted. If they did, I would 
arrange to have them shipped back to Revan for 
detailed interrogation. So my job was to travel 
all along the front wi -- as we were advancing toward
 the end of the war, and talk to interrogation 
officers who thought they had a prisoner who --  
Q: Who would fit this. 

A: -- who -- who will fit that category, and then 
I would interr ogate hi m and if he did, then I 
bring him back to Revan, to 6824DIC. So that 
was my job. So, I could go wherever I wanted, 
which opened up a lot of adventur
es, you know, like the Lipizzaner ho
rses that I me ntion in my 
book.  

Q: Right, right. 
A: I happened to be at the right place at 
the right time. Or the liberation of Dachau. 
Q: Right.  
A: I arrived there the day after 
Dachau was liberated. Or, going b
ack in my own unit, I found out 
where the 16
th
 armored division that I had trained with 
in Arkansas, I found out where it was, so 
I could say, okay, let™s go there. So even up to Czechoslovakia, and the 16
th
 armored division 
was going into Pilsen, and so I sa
w some  of my old colleagues ag
ain, friends that I had trained 
with in Arkansas, pattern of circles. I me t the m
 just outside of Pilse
n, Czechoslovakia during the 
end of the war. And that™s where we had the 
Lipizzaner horse adventure, and that™s when -- 
where the wa r ended. That™s where I happened to 
be when it all came to an end, so -- so -- 
Q: Right. Well, the -- th
e tape is running out --

A: Right. 
Q: -- so we™re going to change tapes and 
get back to some  of t hese stories. 
A: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Tell me  about your arrival in Dachau the day af
ter it was liberated, that must have been some  
experience for you. 
A: I had never heard of Dachau before, I didn™t 
know anything about it. 
All I knew was that I 
wanted to go into Munich to look for a place 
to sleep, really. During the war when we were 
traveling like this, and there were just my driver 
and I, and we were just try to find a military 
unit, one of ours, that was billeted in some  hot
el, and -- or whenever we advanced, they would 
find a public building, like a hotel, and just confiscat
e it and say this is the 
headquarters. And this 
is where the division officers woul
d -- would sleep and they woul
d just take over the hotel. So 
with my orders, which we re really marvelous 
be cause I was traveling 
by command of General 
Eisenhower, I could get a room or a free meal 
almost anyplace I went. So we were always 
looking for some  place like that, 
and I was heading toward Munich when I -- I don™t know 
whether -- whether my driver, or whether we 
were getting directions from some one, toward 
Dachau just outside of Munich a
nd -- and -- and so we went over that way. And then came  -- just 
to see what -- what was going on there. We  hadheard in getting the directions that this was a 

special camp that the -- the Germans had operate
d. So we ma de a little detour on our way to 
Munich. Actually, it was on the way, and then ca
me  upon Da chau. Then I found that it was just 
the day after the liberation -- the -- the day -- act
ually, it was two days after, because the day 
after the liberation, the grand duke of Luxembour g, 
the Prince Felix -- not the grand duke, but 
the Prince Consort of the Grand Duchess had been th
ere to greet and liberate,
 or -- or be present 
for the liberation of Luxembourgers who had beenat the Dachau concentration camp. So if I had 

been there one day earlier, I would have had the o
pportunity to meet the -- th-the Prince Consort, 
Prince Felix. So we got there, and -- and that™s
 how we ca me  upon the camp. Even then, I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
31 
 
think it ma de an impact on me  that it has in 
retrospect, looking back 
on it, having learned so 
much more about the Holocaust and the atrocities
, all I know is this was a horrible place. But I 
thought it was -- my first interpretation without
 anybody telling me  -- we 
really didn™t know. I 
say -- we honestly were very naïve. Concentr
ation camp per se didn™t 
mean a thing to me . I 
thought this was a -- a prison camp where people who committed crimes were put. And so I 
didn™t really get the feel for this, except the hu 
-- the humanity aspect of it. Even a -- a prisoner 
who committed murder shouldn™t be  treated the wa y 
these people had been treated, the way they 

looked. And Dachau you know, was not a -- a deat
h camp, Dachau was just -- but these people 
were starving, and -- and had starved. I m- mea
n, the -- the corpses we saw. And it just didn™t 
register until long after, as I f
ound out more and more about it, a
nd I could say, I was there, I saw 
this and di dn™t realize what it was. 

Q: So you didn™t know what you were seeing. 

A: Yeah, I -- I didn™t realize,
 I thought it was a prison camp wher
e the prisoners were just not 
properly treated. 

Q: So tell me , did you wa
lk around, or you just -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- you just looked from your Jeep? 

A: No, frankly, I couldn™t. I -- I™m -- I have 
a weak stomach. I -- I really -- you know, for a long 
time, I -- I -- I still have difficulty
 -- ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ was the 
first movie I ever saw in which a 
concentration camp was depicted that I -- that I 
could tolerate, because I -- I thought it was very 
tastefully done. Wa s ex
cellently -- and yed -- you 
know, he didn™t dwell on -- he just showed 
enough to realize the horror of it 
without going into the detail that 
some of the films do. But I -- I 
don™t -- I don™t like to read books th
at have a lot of graphic murder 
scenes in it, I -- I -- I have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
32 
 
weak stoma c h. That probably isn™t the best way to
 say a we -- weak stom
ach, I -- I just -- I™m 
just softy, I™m a softy, I don™t like to see peopl
e suffer. I don™t -- I don™t 
li-like to see animals 
suffer, I certainly don™t like to see people suffer.
 So I™m afraid I™m like a lot of other people, you 
know, if you don™t know what you™re seeing, you™d just
 rather not look at it anyway, if you don™t 
have to. 
Q: We re you frightened?  When you wa -- when you came to that place? 

A: No, more -- more shocked. The -- the idea of
, you know, inhuma nity that was evident there. 
And as I say, I thought this was just a prison 
camp, where -- where prisoners were kept. Under 
those circumstances, how could they treat peop
le like that?  Even if they deserved rough 
treatment, they shouldn™t be treate
d -- that was my reaction. And -- 
Q: And how long did you stay -- 

A: Oh not more -- we were just couple of 
hour -- not even couple of hours, we just -- 
Q: Did your driver walk -- 
A: -- going through. 
Q: -- or did your driver stay with you? 

A: Oh ya -- you -- just walked -- walked in
 and ge -- and the wooden gate was there. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I saw -- I actually saw one person die. He
 was too weak to even -- a ma n who was just 
too weak to even talk. And that 
-- that was devastating to me . I 
had -- I didn™t want to see much 
more of it. I saw corpses. I saw one building th
at had obviously been to
rched with people having 
been locked in the building, and then tried to di
g their way out underneath it. That w -- that was 
it, that was the -- the worst of it 
all. So beyond that I didn™t want to
 see any more. And I -- I just -
- I saw enough to realize how horrible it was. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408

Q: Did you talk to the American troops who we
re there? We re they finding guards that you 
mi ght have interrogated, or did you just want 
to get out of there as fast as you could? 
A: No, I didn™t see a single German -- 
Q: You didn™t see a single German?  

A: -- at -- at my [indecipherable] 
I mean, a single German sol dier -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- at that point. They had al
ready rounded up -- what happened 
at -- at -- and this is second 
hand information -- at -- at Buchenwald, for inst
ance, the guards took off. I me an, they -- they 

weren™t equipped to fight the advancing an -- Ge
rman -- so when -- when the am -- advancing 
American. When the Americans advanced, they ju
st all ran away. And Buchenwald, the inma tes 
liberated Buchenwald, and that story I know first 
hand because we eventually come  to it because 
there were Luxembourge rs involved in the Buchen
wald camp. I actually -- by then I knew quite 

a bit about it, and so the Buchenwald story I kno
w more about, even though I hadn™t been there, 
of how it was liberated and so forth. 

Q: We ll why don™t you get into that and then 
we can go back to th
e -- the horse story. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Why don™t you -- 

A: Well, th-the Buchenwald thing actually di dn™t co
me to my attention until the trials and then 
Buchenwald was just a name  of other camps that had been there. But it became  personally close 

to me  during my e mbassy days, 40 years late
r. In Luxembour g there is an Amicale de 
Buchenwald, and these are Luxembourgers, some  
Jewish, non-Jews, some  were deserters of the 

army, some  were the parents of Luxembourgers 
who had been forced into the German army, 
who deserted and then the parents were thrown
 into the concentration camp, so we had a -- a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
34 
 
mi x. There were about si -- I think at that pra 
-- point, 74 Luxembourgers in Buchenwald who 40 
years later still made up what they call the Amicale de Buchenwald, the al umni of Buchenwald. 
They were liberated, or actually they sa
w the first the Americans at 11:30 on the 11
th
 of April, 
1945. They had sent an SOS on their home made  -- se
cretly home ma de radios, giving away their 
location where they were. They could hear the g
unfire, and they could hear even the -- the 
motors of the tanks of the sixth armo red divisi
on advancing. The Nazi guar
ds took off, the -- the 
SS people took off, and - -  and the liberators caught 
a few of them, and -- I mean, not the liberator 
-- the inma tes caught a few of the Na zi guards be
fore the liberators came and -- and took care of 
them. But most of them I -- were gone. The -- 
the whole leadership of the camp was gone. So by 
the time the Americans arrived, they were met 
with open arms by the inma tes who had liberated 
them. We ll among the m were these Luxembour gers. 
From that time  on, when they got back to 
Luxembour g, they organized thei
r reunion group, their amicale. 
There are a lot of these in 
Luxembour g, resistance groups who have organized al
umni of this particul
ar -- they call the 
LPL, the League Patiotigue Luxemb ourgoise. Th
e LPL, that was the Luxembourg underground, 
which worked with the FFI. We ll, they all ha ve 
alumni clubs, and they have luncheons and -- and 
i-it™s really a -- a very moving experience to 
be with those people. Well, the Amicale de 
Buchenwald for 40 years, and still today, at 11:30 on the 11
th
 of April, every year, me et at the 
American military cemetery and 
place a wreath at the tomb of 
General Patton, whose third army 
liberated the camp. And then they have a -- a little prayer cer-ceremony and a little remi niscing 
and then they all go and have lunch together
 and -- and remi nisce, and -- and renew their 
friendships. Well they invited the American amba
ssador to participate naturally, and so I took 
them up on it. And so I became part of the activity
 and it got to the point  where after the first 
year they asked me  to give a ta
lk, and I would talk to them, and 
-- and so that they ma de me  an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
35 
 
honorary me mber of the Amicale de Buchenwald. 
In 1945, the -- I received a letter from the 
sixth armored division, a vetera
n™s group, it™s the sixth armored 
association, they
™re called the 
Super Sixes. And a bunch of them ar e comi
ng back to Europe to celebrate the 40
th
 anniversary of 
the end of the war and the liberat
ion. And they want to come  to 
Luxembourg, and they asked me  
if I would speak to them at 
the cemetery. A lot of these vete
ran™s groups did that. During a 10 
month period of celebrating the end of the warand the liberation of Luxembourg, I was at that 
cemetery 69 times in 10 months, offi cially, not c
ounting time s when I would take a visit or two, 
to visit. A Colonel Reed from Louisville, Kentuc
ky, he wrote to me  and -- and said that he was 
bringing a group of veterans and wo
uld I speak to them at the cemetery and of -- I said of course 
I would. But could you arrange to ma ke your visi t at a time  when we could also have the 

Amicale de Buchenwald at the same time. I -- I me
ntion this incident in my book, because it -- it 
was one of the highlights I think of my e mbassy 
career. When I arrived there -- it was all -- 
always arranged for the ambassador to be th
e last one to arrive, when everybody™s -- ev -- 
everythi ng is in place. American flag on the 
fender, and ambassador flag, and -- and a lot of 

whoop-de-doo. And I arrived, and wa s quite a shocking experience because there were two 

groups standing at General Patton™s grave, andthen 5,000 white ma rble crosses and Stars of 

David behind them. It™s -- it™s a me morable sc
ene every time. You don™t visit that ceme tery 
without getting a lump in your throat. Every one
 of these people buriedthere died during the 
Battle of the Bulge, at the military cemetery in Luxembourg. And then General Patton™ s grave is 

right at the front of it. I arrive
d there, and here were the -- th
e Americans on one group and -- and 
the Amicale de Buchenwald, Luxemb ourgers in the other gr oup, just looking at each other. 

Nobody knew what to do, or what to say, because
 you know, you could -- the atmosphere was so 
heavy you could -- you c -- cut it. And I thought, 
oh what have I wrought here, you know, I™ve 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
36 
 
brought these people together, how 
am I going to break this -- break
 the ice here. And just as I 
walked up -- and I knew the Luxemb ourgers of cour
se, and -- and just as I walked up I heard one 
of the Luxembourg wome n say to one of the Am
ericans, ﬁI think I remember you, isn™t your 
name  Buddy? ﬂ  And it was, and these two got t
ogether and hugged each othe r, and -- and that 
broke the ice, I didn™t have to do anything. Th
-They s-started mi ngling then an-and introducing 
themselves to each other, and -- and that was ju
st  a -- a moving experien
ce. The leader of the 
Amicale de Buchenwald, or the president of it wa
s the mayor -- at that  time the mayor of a little 
town called Beaufort where there is a very hist
oric and roma ntic castle ruin in Luxemb ourg. 
There are quite a few castles in L
uxembourg, 74 of them to be exact, 
and Beaufort is one of the -
- the most romantic because the ruin is fairly
 well preserve d and you can tour it and imagine you 
can still see the dungeon and -- and the torture cham
ber and everythi ng else. So it™s a big tourist 
attraction, and the ma yor, of course, is respon
sible for the community and the chateau which 
belongs to the community. He invited the entire sixth armored division bunch to come to 
Beaufort as his guests and sure the -- the buses 
loaded up and they spent 
the rest of the day -- 
they changed their whole itinerar
y. They spent the rest of the da
y at this site and having their 
dinner in Beaufort, and mi ngling with the peop
le and -- and they were
 just a very warm 
experience. And to this day, and every time we
™ve gone back now since our embassy days, we 
always go to Beaufort, look up the mayor and -- 
and remi nisce about the days. They published a 
book about Buchenwald and it tells 
the whole story of the liberati
on and -- and the inma tes and 
what -- what it was like, the condi
tion. And it ends with pictures 
of this reunion group at the 40
th
 
anniversary. It™s -- a-and this mi ght well be a bo
ok that ought to be in -- in the museum library, 
too, I -- I™ll -- I™ll see to that
, yeah. But I learned more about Buchenwald from those people, 
associating with them than I did Dachau because 
as I say, i-it™s a real emotional challenge, more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
37 
 
than I could cope with. I™m -- I™m not -- you have
 to really have a strong stomach. People who 
don™t believe the Holocaust ever happened ought to ma ke a visit. Not now, should have been 
there, see the real thing. The -- 
they™d find out it happened, yeah. 
Q: Let™s go to a -- a more
 -- a happier story --  
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- although it™s still i
nvolved in this time period, where you got
 to save the Lipizzaner horses. 
Let™s talk about that . 

A: We ll, yeah I -- I don™t -- I don™t think -- well
, ma ybe -- ma ybe I™m -- I™m the savior of the -- 
the ma res anyway, not the stallion. There are two 
stories about the Lipizzaner horses and they 
always get mi xed up. Walt Disney got them all -- 
got it all mi xed up in hi
s, ﬁMiracle of the 
White Stallion.ﬂ But I™m in that movi e. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes, but now identified -- the ro
le in -- in that movie actually 
did happen that way and -- and I 
was involved in it. I had arrived 
there with my driver on a search
 for -- actually I was looking for 
Heisenberg, you know, Heisenberg the physicist N
obel prize winner. And our Manhattan project 
people were convinced that Germany was worki
ng on an atom bomb. And they wanted to know 
what Friedi sch and Weisecker, and what Heisen
berg had done and how far they had gotten. And 
the truth of it all is that the 
Germans really were not working 
on an atomic bomb. The y weren™t, 
but we didn™t know that, so we were looking fo
r people who knew some thing about Heisenberg, 
and von We isecker and atomic research and if nothing 
else it gave me  an excuse to go hither and 
yon, and go everywhere. So anyhow, that™s who I 
was supposedly looking for and it -- and I 
ma naged to be where the 16
th
 armored division was, near Ho
fe and [indecipherable] Germany, 
right near the Czech border. I was the only one
 at -- and there was a s -- a second armored 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
38 
 
cavalry regime nt which was heading in that part
icular sector. And the colonel who was in -- in 
charge of that particular ba
ttalion couldn™t speak Ge
rman. But one evening I was playing cards 
with some body and they need an interpreter and 
the colonel sent for me  and I went over to 
interpret for him, the reason being that a Ge
rman captain had voluntarily surrendered and was 
brought before the colonel to be interrogated and 
he -- the colonel coul dn™t talk to him because 
he couldn™t speak German, so I was called in to 
be the interpreter and 
Disney does have that 
scene in the movie. The colonel 
is actually eating his dinner and 
when the prisoner is brought in 
and I do the interrogating. In
 the movie the pr isoner tells the colonel about a horse farm, but that 
didn™t -- that -- that  wasn™t the cas
e at all. He was telling the co
lonel about dienst stella ost, 
service station east, translation. Whi c h is 
a military intelligence 
unit, German military 
intelligence unit, very much like 
ours, detailed interroga tion. This was a German intelligence unit 
gathering infor mation about the Soviet Union. And 
they were in a hunting lodge in the Bohemi an 
forest, just halfway between the border and Pi
lgrin, and they were interrogating German -- I 
mean, Russi an PW, who had informa tion of a strategic nature, like we were doing on our side. 
This unit had been in existence for five years an
d they had maps of every airport in the Soviet 
Union, of every bridge, of every installation, 
every weapon, anything you wanted to know about 
the Soviet army, they had it. The Soviets were
 about five mi les to the east of them, the 
Americans about five mi les to the west of them, 
they were in the mi ddle. Now what should they 
do?  Do nothing, Soviets mi ght get there first. If
 they find out what the Germans had been doing 
there, it™d be their heads. They could just dest
roy everything they had and take to the woods, but 
that wouldn™t be German. They™re not going to destroy anything they™ve been gathering for five 

years. So their third option was 
to surrender to the Americans befo
re the Soviets would get there. 
So this captain voluntarily came to our unit and 
surrendered and told my colonel all about his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
39 
 
dienst stella ost. They wanted to surrender to 
us and turn over to us all of the documentation and 
all of the interrogation reports, ma
ps and everything they had about the Soviet Union. So they 
needed a German speaking officer and I was the 
only one there, so th
e colonel said, you know, 
ﬁDoli, your -- you go in, we™ll arrange this.ﬂ So we
 had a two and a half to
n truck and driver and 
enlisted ma n guard and then the 
sergeant and I in the Jeep -- a
nd sergeant [indecipherable] the 
truck and I in my Jeep with my driver and we dr
ove into this hunting lodge. It was an air force 
colonel -- Luftwaffe colonel, a lieutenant colone
l, actually, who was the commander of this unit, 
Holters was his name  and he ma de a big show, a very formal first wor -- World Wa r 
1
 general 
st aff offi cer, wi t h  a surrender s --
 the whole thing. We loaded all 
the stuff on the trucks and there 
were just a few officers and enlisted me n and th
ey got on the truck with the documents and the 
colonel got in the Jeep with me  and then we drove
 back to our place. Th
e whole thing didn™t take 
more than about 20 mi nutes. But on the way Co
lonel Holters told me  -- asked me  if I knew 
anything about horses. And I didn™t know a thing a
bout horses. We ll, particularly he wanted to 
know if I knew anything about the Lipizzaner horses. And I didn™t know anything about them 

either. So he proceeded to tell me  about Spanis
h riding sc hool, and the hi st ory of the Li pizzaner, 
very fascinating. And then I found out the purpose of
 it all was to tell me that there was a -- a gut 
-- stut -- stud -- stud farm under the German de
partme nt of agriculture, which had been brought 
to this pl ace -- I forget  the name
 of the owner of the estate now,
 Arco whatever it was, located 
just in Czechoslovakia, sort of a equivalent to 
a bluegrass region, which pa
rticularly fertile grass 
and particularly good region to breed horses. An
d the German Departme nt of Agriculture had 
brought these mares and some stallions and othe
r horses of a different 
breed, Caucasians and 
some  were from the Rus s ian steppes. About 200 
horses, but primarily Lipizzaners for breeding 
purposes to this stud farm. And they were ju
st about two miles s
outh of where w -- two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
40 
 
kilome ters south of where we were. And he told
 me  all about this, so when he explained the 
Spanish riding school to me , I -- I just felt well
, we ought to get involved here. So we took a 
detour. I sent a sergeant and a 
truck with the other prisoners, 
and docume nts and everything on, 
and we took a little detour and this how we ca me
 upon this stud far m. And th-the -- they -- there 
were all the lipi -- my first look 
at Lipizzaner horses, a beautiful sight. This is in May, and the 
meadow wa s in bloom and everything else is 
just beautiful. And I had learned enough about the 
horses to really appreciate this. There were so
me  young horses who were fr
olicking in -- in the 
meadow and doing things that is officially de
scribed as airs above 
the ground, which are the 
things that we train the stallions to do -- I m
ean we -- they trained th
e stallions to do at the 
Spanish riding school and wherever they have Lipi
zzaner horses, there are two farms here in the 
United States where they train lipid -- breed 
and train Lipizzaners. A
nyhow, these foals -- th-
these horses we-were -- were doing these things na
turally. The trick is to
 teach them to do it on 
command. And that was the beauty of this develo
pment that I saw. Anyhow, the point was that I 
had the opportunity to -- to meet Colonel Po
tisky, who was the leader of the Spanish riding 
school, who happened to be there at
 that particular time. We ll, to
 ma ke a long story short, from 
the stud farm, once I saw it, I took some  pictures
 and I went on back then, reported to Colonel 
Reed what I had seen. He had a brother who -- w
ho had perfor me d an e -- an eques -- equestrian 
of the Olympics. And he went ri
ding a horse that was name d Potis
ky in honor of Colonel Potisky 
of the Spanish riding school. So he knew all abou
t them. And I said, ﬁWell, there™s a stud far m.ﬂ 
Here we are and -- so he took over. And we ha
d German PW and a lot of Polish DPs who were 
in the area, who then helped some  of our Amer
ican forces move the horses back into Germany 
because the fear was that the ri 
-- Sovi ets would ge t there first, and they would eat them, because 
the rumor, and it™s -- I guess it was true, too, th
ere was a Spanish riding school in Budapest, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
41 
 
the Soviets tried to get those horses to use th
em to pull wagons and the Li pizzaners wouldn™t 
respond, so they ji -- but-butchered 
them. And so they were afraid 
this what would happen to the 
Lipizzaner. Plus the fact that the 
Polish DPs didn™t like the Germans, and they would take care of 
the Lipizzaners also if they got a chance. So we rescued them, we -- we brought them. Some  of 

the stallions were there, but mostly they were th
e -- the ma res and the foals and some  of the other 
horses. And we moved them across into a sector 
of -- of Germany, Schwartzburg, which is in the 
command of the second armored cavalry regime nt
. That™s the story th
at I was involved in. 
Meanwhile, at about the same  ti me , General Wa lker of the 20
th
 corps ca me into Austria to St. 
Martin in -- in Crise, and came to
 an estate there which they se
t up as their headquarters, where 
the stallions of the Spanish ri
ding school from Vienna had been brought by Colonel Potisky. And 
colonel -- General Walker was quite impressed 
and knowing that Patton was a horse lover and 

cavalryma n, notified Patton, who was at that time 
I think in -- in Frankfort. And Patton and the 
deputy secretary of war, who was 
visiting the fr ont at that time, got into Patton™ s plane and they 
flew to Saint Martin™s and the stallions from 
the Spanish riding school put on a show for Patton -

Q: Really? 

A: -- with the result that Pa
tton put the Lipizzaners under the 
protection of the United States 
army, all Lipizzaners, which included the ones fro
m the stud far m, who were included in that 
general order. Nobody could touc
h the Lipizzaner horses who we
re under the protection of the 
United States army, because Patton wa s quite impre
ssed with them. And it turned out that he had 
wid -- ridden in the Olympics in 1912 against 
Colonel Potisky. And the most fa mous quote to 
me , a Patton quote is -- I don™t have the exact quote
, but he was quite peevishly concerned that 
why the Austrians used 57 healthy, we ll-trained 
me n to teach horses how to dance, when they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
42 
 
should be at the front fighting. I 
mean, that was the gist of it. 
Imagine these guys teaching horses 
to dance instead of fighting for their country. But 
nevertheless he -- he did protect the horses, and 
-- so Patton really is the liber ator  of the Lipizz
aners. And that™s the Disney story. Now Disney 
had the whole thing -- 
Q: Together. 

A: -- brought together, you know, a
nd there was fighting and -- and th
at -- there was resistance, 
and -- but not really, it was a very peaceful opera
tion, but a great adventure. And the sequel was 
that my pattern of circles again,is that 50 years later, my wife 
and I were in Vienna, were going 

to Vienna and wanted to go to the Spanish ridi
ng school, to see a performa nce there. And we had 
our youngest son Brian with us. And we coul
dn™t get any tickets. It was the opening 
performa nce, September 12
th
 and they were all sold out. Nobody could get me  any tickets. And 
consequently, I had a photograph and I brought so
me  of the photographs with me  of Colonel 
Potisky and myself shaking hands, with a Lipizzane
r standing next to us. So I -- very brash, I 
wrote a letter to Colonel Potisky, commandant of 
the Spanish riding school in Vienna, Austria 
and I included that picture. And told him, you kn
ow, this is me , and [indecipherable] the incident 
of our -- our -- our visit and said
 that I was tryi ng to get ticke
ts for the opening performa nce and 
if he could possibly help me  I 
would appreciate it, etcetera. I 
didn™t hear fr om hi m unt il about a 
week before we left for Europe on our vacationtrip. I got a letter from the Spanish riding school, 

not from Colonel Potisky, saying 
that he had retired, he™s on a 
trip around the world, my letter 
had caught up with him in Paris. And they had tick
ets for the three of us to come  to the Spanish 
riding school performa nce, and I should pick 
them up in the -- before 11 o™clock on the 
performa nce on that day. And sure enough, we stayed
 at the Sarka hotel, and that morning I went 
to -- I had this -- the whol e [indecipherable] wh
ere the school performs, 
there™s a big line of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
43 
 
people standi ng in line to buy tickets for standi
ng room only because they™re sold out. But you 
could buy tickets on the day of the performa nce to
 stand. We ll, only -- only time in my  life I™ve 
ever crashed a line. I went to th
e front, got a lot of dirty looks,
 but I presented the letter from 
colonel -- from that Spanish ridi
ng school and sure enough they had tickets for me . Ha d to pay 
for them, they weren™t free. I paid for the tickets
, went back hotel, got Wi nnie and our -- our son, 
and then at 11 o™clock we went ba
ck for the perfor mance. And as we came  in there to present our 
tickets, the usher looked at the 
tickets and held up his hand 
and motioned to some body who took 
us in a direction different from where everybody
 else was going. And I thought there™s a mi stake 
ma de, and we -- our tickets aren
™t any good. But instead they t
ook us to the royal box, and we 
had the perf -- we sat in there,
 in the royal box of the Spanish 
riding school. That was a big, big 
thrill.  
Q: Right. 

A: And whe n the horses came in in the opening, they 
all come in single file, 16 of them, and they 
come  right toward the royal box, and they -- si
multaneously the riders tip their hats. And 
everybody thought we must be somebody very im
portant. That was a thrilling mo me nt.  
Q: I bet it was. 

A: And that was -- and that™s 50 years after this 
particular incident, so 
it had a special meaning. 
That -- that™s the Lipi zzaner stor y. 

Q: Okay. Your next assignme nt
, I gather, is to go to the 
Palace Hotel in Mondorf, yes? 
A: The war is over, in fact the war ended, unbeknowns
t to me at the time, th
is unit of the dienst 
stella ost, Colonel Holters and two of his offi
cers -- we decided to send them to Augsburg, and 
then from Augsburg to our special service sta 
-- our own detailed inte
rrogation center, our own 
service station in the Ardenst, 
in Revan. And meanwhile my driver
 and I headed back to Revan, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
44 
 
and I continued on that particular project for about 
a week or so in Revan, of Colonel Holters and 
-- and his staff. And it was a wonderful time b
ecause we got back the day the war ended, got 
back into Revan. And the next day we  had a vi
ctory parade, full dress uniform, just my  unit, 
6824DIC, we had a drummer who pl
ayed the drum, no -- no band, or
chestra, and an American 
flag, and we got all dressed up, officers and en
listed me n, and we had a parade right through 
Revan, and th-the French people cheering us on, vi
va l™Amerique. And it was a great -- a great 
victory. And the next week or two I had a wonderful time going down to Rans for the opera, and 

interrogating -- finish
ing the job of Colonel Holters. Then
 we  ran into trouble cause our war 
departme nt wasn™t interested in
 having that information about S
oviet Union, cause that was our -
- they were our allies. And so there was a resi
stance. And then the fact my commanding officer 
was -- supposedly I heard, reprimanded for either -- 
either -- for even gath
ering this information. 
But you probably know the name  Bob Lovitt, and Bob Lovitt was a deputy secretary of state, I 

believe at the time. And he used his influence 
and eventually Colonel Holters, the two offi cers, 
and all the docume nts we -- we captured in the 
Bohe mi an forest were brought to this secret 
location here in Wa shington. And that™s the end of
 that relationship, that™s all I knew about. My 
commanding officer called me  in and said I had a 
new assignme nt, and our detailed interrogation 
center was going to be dissolved and I was going 
to go to a place that he ha d never heard of 
before, and that™s Mondorf, Luxe mbourg. Meanwh
ile, I had made one trip to Luxembourg on a 
special assignme nt to go back a
nd see if I could locate any of my
 fa mily. So this transfer to 
Luxembour g came as a real surprise. In fact, Ihad -- I had no idea ther
e were even Americans 
stationed in Luxembour g. I assume d, of course, but
 I hadn™t pursued that. So that was a real 
assignment, to get back into Luxemb ourg. And that
 assignme nt was to the central prisoner of war 
enclosure number 32, which was also coded in ou
r orders as Ashcan. That was the code word 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
45 
 
that they used, send us to the place. And that
™s all I knew about it. I had no idea what the place 
was, what it was used for or what I™d be doi
ng. All I know is I was tr
ansferred. The good news 
was that my best friend and colleague, Malcolm H
ilkey, with whom I had been at -- at-at -- in 
Vienna, and -- and in Paris, and also at 
Revan, was going to the same  place. And my 
commanding officer would be Capt
ain Sensnik, whom I had me t at Ca mp  Richie, Maryland. So I 
would be with old friends and -- and ready for what
ever they had in store for me . So I arrived in 
Luxembour g, my second visit, this time  on official
 assignment. There was a lot of talk when the 
war ended that we were now going to go to the fa
r east in military intelligence, and I anticipated 
that that™s probably what would happen to me . 
But instead I wa s sent to Luxembourg, which to 
me  was a mi racle, and which shoul
dn™t have happened that way, 
but I didn™t question it. So I 
arrive d in Mondorf. I knew Mondorf because I ha d 
gone there with my brother Heinrich who is 
ma rried, when I was still in Luxembourg as a boy. And he and his wife had taken me  to Mondorf 

on occasion. There was a little train called the Jo
ngelly that went from Luxembourg city to 
Mondorf, for people who went there, this reso
rt, Mondorf was a -- a spa, mi neral water and 
health resort health spa. And 
I knew the place that I was assi gn
ed to, that was the palace hotel. 
Four story hotel casino, with gambling tables an
d the works. And guest rooms, and all of the 
facilities for casino for -- for a health resort. So I reported there and 
then I found it -- it had 
changed quite a lot from what I reme mber as
 a boy. A fence around it, Klieg lights overheard, 
camouflage ma terial, and [indecipherable] 
hanging, you know, you couldn™t see what was going 
on inside. There were machine gun towers on each of 
the four corners of this fenced in area. And 
there was a roving guard, a Jeep, military poli
ce riding around, I think, constantly. And all I 
knew is I been transferred to
 CCPW number 32, I didn™t know 
what was -- what was going on 
inside there. So I asked the serg
eant of the guard in the Jeep, sa
y what™s going on here?  And hi -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
46 
 
his answer is very typical of se
rgeant of the guard, he said, th-the
 -- ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁI™ve been 
here three weeks,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™ve never been inside
. All I know is to get in here you have to have 
a pass signed by God, and some body has to verify 
the signature.ﬂ So that aroused my  curiosity, 
but I had the right papers, and they let me
 in, they -- I was expected. There was a 
noncommi ss ioned officer in the lobby of the hotel 
when I walked in, and he read my orders, and 
signed me  to my room. He said, ﬁThis is where yo
u™re going to live, and that™s also where you™re 
going to work.ﬂ And I asked him, ﬁWhat kind of a 
place is this?ﬂ And he said, ﬁWell, it™s an 
interrogation center, it™s a wa -- 
interrogating prisoners of war.ﬂ So
 I assume d this is continuation 
of what we™ve been doing at the 
-- at Revan, at DIC. So as I was 
in -- in the process of unpacking 
my belongings in my room, which was rather spar
sely furnished, but comf ortable. And I heard a 
knock on the door, and I thought this is one of othe
r officers comi ng in to introduce himself. So I 
opened the door, and before me  stood none other 
than Herman Goering, the Reichsmarshall of 

the Third Reich. So I was the most surprised pers
on in the world, and stood there with my mouth 
open. He clicked his heels and says, ﬁGoering, Reic
hsma rshall.ﬂ So I asked him to step inside. 
He was carrying a pair of trousers and he said, 
ﬁThis an extra pair of
 trousers.ﬂ I couldn™t 
understand this, but he, in a smirking fashion -- he 
had a way of delivering 
his lines with a smirk 
on his face. He said, ﬁWell, I wanted to be a 
model prisoner, and several days ago we were 
declassi fied. We  are now ordinary pr isoners of
 war. And we only permitted a certain amount of 
clothing. And I overlooked this particular pair of 
trousers. I didn™t want to get in trouble, so I 
want to turn them in to you.ﬂ We
ll, I -- I wasn™t quite in tune w
ith what he was leading up to, and 
then it suddenly dawned on me  that he needed an
 excuse to come  and see me  and I think he was 
sacrificing an extra pair of trousers for an excuse
. I didn™t know anything 
about the operation yet, 
but it ma -- was made clear to me later on. What he
 wanted to know is he wanted to know who I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
47 
 
was. He fancied himself the -- the leader of
 the group that was imprisoned. And I didn™t know 
who they were, but I knew now that one of them
 was Goering. So it was his business to find out 
who the newcomers, who the arrivals were. And 
he had seen me  comi ng i n through the gate, so 
he followed procedure and came to see me , using the trousers as an excuse. And then he asked 
me , ﬁ What is your particular assignment here?  
You™re a young ma n, what 
are you doing here? ﬂ  I 
was 26 at the time. And before I could answer 
him, he said, ﬁAre you by any chance the welfare 
officer, who would see to it that we all get trea
ted properly, in accordan
ce with the rules of 
Geneva convention?ﬂ So I was just going to say 
no, I™m an interrogation officer, but when he 
suggested I mi ght be the welfare officer, I sai
d, ﬁOh yeah, I™m going to see to it that you get 
treated properly,ﬂ and he was sa
tisfied. So he then started a li
st of complaints. And he was 
unhappy with the way he was brought here, that he was -- 

Q: Wa -- wa -- can we wait just one moment?  
Is that [indecipherable]. Okay, I™m sorry. 
A: We ll he had -- he had decided 
then -- well, I had decided, rath
er , that  I would see to it that 
they would all get a square deal. And he lodged 
his cam -- ki -- campaign of complaints about he 
was supposed to go to -- go into exile. He had 
brought with him 11 suitcases, with all of his 
uniforms and decorations and his Reichsma rshall 
baton, all his belongings. And he, after all, was 
the head of the German state, successor to Hitl
er and he was going to go to -- into exile like 

Napoleon or any head of state. Instead they brought
 him to this very meager hotel, with a folding 

army cot, straw ma ttress, and he was very unhapp
y with that whole arrangement. And I said well 
I knew nothing about that. And that ended our co
nversation, he clicked his heels and bowed and 
left. That evening at five o™clock, I was to re
port to my commanding offi
cer, to Captain Sensnik. 
And I was a first lieutenant at that time. And I re
ported to Captain Sensni
k and I told him that I 
had a visitor. I told him of th
is particular visit from Goer
ing. And Captain Sensnik, ﬁThat™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
48 
 
great,ﬂ he said, ﬁthat™s your cove
r.ﬂ He said, ﬁEvery one of us needs a cover, and by the way, use 
a different name , don™t use your name. You still have
 relatives in Europe, brothers and sisters, 
and we don™t know what™s ahead, but most of us 
are using different name s, so pick a name .ﬂ 
Well, I picked a n -- a name  of a -- a good L
uxembourg name, Gellen. Said, ﬁOkay, I™ll be John 
Gellen.ﬂ He said, ﬁOkay, that™s
 your name  from now on. All your 
orders, everything you get will 
be in the name  of John Gellen. And you pretend 
to be the welfare officer. You visit all the 
prisoners, listen to what they have
 to say, keep a file of what y
ou hear, and we™ll coordinate that 
with our interrogation reports. So
 yi -- ni -- that™s your job fr
om now on, t hat™s your cover.ﬂ 
Then he explained to me  that a
ll the prisoners were on the third 
and fourth floor, some two in a 
room, some single rooms. The 
second floor was a buffer zone, nothing wa s happening on that 
floor. The first floor, where we were -- we were
 billeted in our sleep
ing rooms and also our 
working offices, but we were tr
ying to find private billets outside of the compound so we could 
go home  at night after work, so we wouldn™t be
 in the same  building with the prisoners. The 
ground floor was a dining room, where the prisoner
s would eat, a lounge where they could read, 
under supervision. If they wore glasses, their glas
ses were kept on the rack
 in the lounge, they 
weren™t allowed to take their glasses upstairs. Da
nger of suicide. They mi ght break their glasses 
and cut their wrists, as some  of the m had tried to do. There was a veranda around the fr ont of the 
hotel where they could sit and s
unbathe. They could actually walk
 in the garden, a nice little 
garden. But they had to stay within
 a barb wire enclosure and there™s 
an electric -- electric wire. I 
had a picture of that, by the way, 
of the electric wire, with a German sign warning high voltage 
so they wouldn™t beyond that. And of course th
ere was a machine gun tower. Now I have my 
own theory of why we had this 
heavy guard around the 
place. None of thes
e people is going to s 
-- going to escape. W- We didn™t have to worry a
bout that. We had to wo
rry about the people on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
49 
 
the outside who mi ght want to get at them. So th
ey were more defense, and guard were more to 
protect them from the outside and keep them 
alive and in good shape for the trials, than 
otherwise. Each room was equipped with a foldin
g army cot, straw ma ttress, two or three GI 
blankets, a four legged stool and a bucket of
 water, and a cake of Lifebuoy soap. The -- 
Q: Lifebuoy? 
A: Lifebuoy, the original Lifebuoy. The kind your 
mother put in your mouth when you used a 
dirty word. That was the offi 
-- the official issue, a deodoran
t soap. There were no doorknobs on 
the doors because they could use th
e screws to -- use the sc -- the 
sharp end of a screw if they 
wanted to hurt themselves. The flush toilet were
 the kind with the tank above and the chain, that 
was remove d. The chain was remove d cause they
 mi ght use the chain. They were not pu -- 
permitted to wear belts, neckties, shoestrings -- which was a real problem. How to keep them in 

their shoes if they wore hightops without shoest
rings. We  ha d to get special permission and they 
were allowed four inch shoestrings so they could 
at least tie the top two holes together . It™s kind 
of humorous  and they made much of that when they exercised a little -- 
a little sense of humor. 
They had absolute fr eedo m to move within the ho
tel. This is how Goering came to my room. He 
could see who was going where and follow and knock on the door. This was by design. This -- 

this helped to stimulate communication. It allowed th
em to visit each other, they could go to each 
other™s rooms and get involved in discussions a
nd arguments, and get ma d at each other and we 
benefited from that. That was part of our tech
nique of gathering information. What did one 
prisoner say about the other prisoner, especi
ally if he was ma d at him. This -- 
Q: Did -- did you walk around a lot so you could 
watch what the social
ization was, and --  
A: Yes -- we -- 

Q: -- and see how they were interacting? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
50 
 
A: -- we -- we -- we -- we took advantage of 
their mutual -- of their -- the way they 
communicated with I -- who spoke to whom, 
and who snubbed whom, because we would then 
play that guy off with a -- against the othe
r one and -- and get information out of him. 
Q: Right. 
A: It was very effective. We -- we did -- we 
didn™t use any what we now consider modern 
interrogation [indecipherable]
 like recordings. There were no secr
et  tapes, defi nitely no tortur e 
devises, I mean we didn™t -- t
humbscrews or any kind of torture device. We didn™t need it. They 
were all willing to talk, a- a
nd they™re quite willing to talk. 
Q: Why do you think that was so, that
 they were so willing to talk? 
A: First of all, the more they were interrogate
d, the more i mportant they we re, because if -- if 

you had a lot of interrogations, in
 the eyes of the other prison
ers, the enemy considered you a 
decision ma ker, you were obviously one of the to
p me n. If you were not interrogated at all, 
which was true of some  of the people, I don™t 
know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn™t 
have been there. Nobody knew who they were. But they had a uniform on and they happened to 

be at the wrong place at the right time and were 
taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they 
were with some body, if t hey were 
in the presence of Goering. Like
 his -- his adjutant, or his aid. 
They were all taken prisoner, unf
ortunately because they happened
 to be Goering™s aid, but they 
had no intelligence value, and they were not perm
itted to continue to be his aid. They just 
became ordinary prisoners of war. So we -- we 
had prisoners who -- who -- 
who just -- we didn™t 
know why they were there, and they didn™t know w
hy they were there, and they wanted to be 
interrogated so they could -- they
 coul d at least feel that they
 were important. That was one 
thing. The other thing wa s none of these prisoners 
presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none 

of them wor ked as part of a team, a united effort
 to protect each other. They were all protecting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
51 
 
only themselves. Not a single one ev
er thought in terms of pr otecti
ng the German general™s staff, 
or protecting the -- the Nazi element, or th
e bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we ha d. And 
those were the three categories that automatically
 they divided themselves into. The general™s 
staff pretty much stuck together 
socially in the prison, 
in their -- their discussion groups and their 
cliques. Excuse me . When they sat on the verand
a or in the lounge, or when they ate together, 
they pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis 
pretty much stuck together. And the same  thing 
with the st atesme n or the mi nisters and some  of 
those. So each one was out to save hi s own neck. 
And they had grievances that went back to Hi
tler™s time, back to 1934 - ™35. If Goering snubbed 
this particular general, this general now ha
d an opportunity to spill the beans about Goering. 
Petty stuff, but this is exactly what we wanted 
-- w-we wanted to hear. So the socializing with 
each other and visiting with each 
other was all pa rt of a interrogation sche me. We had a conflict 
of our own, cause on one hand, there 
were five of us, five interro
gators. And we belonged to the 
Richie cr owd, we were the trai ned military inte
lligence personnel. We  ha d nothing to do with the 
operation of the prison, of how the prisoners were 
fed, or how they were housed or anything else. 
That was under the command of the -- of Col
onel Andrews, Burton C. Andrews, of the 391
st
 
anti-tank battalion -- were his pe
rsonnel. Andrews actually wa s brought
 into this job in charge of 
this detention center fr om a -- a 
prisoner of war -- not a prisoner of
 war enclosure, but a regular 
prison -- what do you call it?  A prison camp. Fo
r military prison camp, American prisoners. He 
was in charge  of -- of a prison camp. So he was a trai ned military warden, and he was in charge 
of this prison. We  had f -- about 
40 or so ordinary German soldie
rs who were ordinary prisoners 
of war. They were the cadre, the work cadre. Th
ey we -- they did the ma nual labor. The prisoners 
didn™t do their own cooking or servin
g of the food or cleaning up, except their rooms, they had to 
clean their own rooms. But they didn™t run the 
sweepers, or -- or do th
e dusting or anything in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
52 
 
the public rooms. So we had Germ
an soldiers who were carpenter
s, electricians, cooks, bakers, 
even the chaplain, a doctor. Most anything we ne
eded to run a prison. But these were ordinary 
German prisoners who were now in a position to be
 associated with the -- what they called the 
bunsin, the big animals who had run the -- the dict
atorship under Hitler™s regime . Wa s quite a -- 
that interplay was very interesting to watch. Well then we had the prison guards, the Americans, 
who supervised all of this, who directed the 
German PW, who were the work cadre. And they 
were responsible for the securi
ty and -- and everything else. Now Colonel Andrews came from a 
regular detention center, from a prison. We  had 
difficulty convincing him that these were not 
people who were being punished. They were people who were being interrogated in preparation 

for a trial. And that we needed them in pr
etty good physical condition and good me ntal condition 

in order to get their cooperation while we 
interrogated them. But 
he looked upon them as 
criminals. And he was the -- the prison warden. So
 if they didn™t exactly behave as he thought 
they should, like if they didn™t have their room 
very clean, then he would put them in solitary 
confinement . They™d stay in a baseme nt for 24 
hours, or ma ybe two days if their shoes weren™t 
shined properly. And we™d say th
at doesn™t help our interrogati
on, because if they get ma d and 
resentful, then they won™t coopera
te with us. So we had that inte
rplay, so -- and we finally had to 
go pretty high up, as high as Wild Bill Donovan, the commanding general of the -- what was 
then the OSS, who was our me ntor. He is the on
e who coached us on how to get information out 
of the prisoners, he was a -- an expert in th at kind of thing. And Donovan then had to use his 

general rank to get Colonel Andrews to cooperate
 with the idea that th
is was a -- a processing 
center, not a center for punishme nt. 

Q: We ™re going to have 
to stop the tape now -- 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
53 
 
Q: -- because we™re running out.  
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
54 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: We  -- when we compl e ted the last tape, you 
were talking about the 
problem with Colonel 
Andrews -- 
A: Andrews, yeah. 

Q: -- and his view of the prisoners versus -- or
 were these prisoners, we
re these cr iminals, who 
were these people? 

A: We ll, he treat -- as far as he
 was concerned, they we
re prisoners of war. And one of my jobs -- 
Andrews took a personal liking to me, primar
ily because I knew my
 way around Luxembourg. 
So whenever we had a VIP visitor like Genera
l Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher 
officials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appo
inted tour guide. So that became  one of my 
functions. In addition to what I had to do, I w
ould take them around Luxe
mbourg and show them 
places. We ll, Andrews enjoyed that part of it 
himself because he would always go along and -- 
and I™d on a couple of occasions invited 
Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon. And 
bourbon was just not available anywhere, except as 
we got it in our liquor ration in Mondorf. So 
every once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the fe
w of us officers would get together and have a 
little party, and we invited Prin
ce Felix to a couple of these a
ffairs, which impressed Colonel 
Andrews very much. So we finally got around to 
the point of where he saw our viewpoint in 
addition to the official persuasi
on he got from above. You know, we
 can™t treat these people like 
convicted criminals serving their sentences. We  ha
ve to try them first, and before we can try 
them, we ha d to interrogate them, and -- and that 
public relations effort helped considerably. It 

also resulted in my being at Nuremberg when
 I had done everything possible to avoid going to 
Nuremberg, cause I was tired of
 the whole thing. But once I 
arrived there on temporary duty, 
Andrews snagged me  and he wouldn™t let me  go b
ecause he wanted me  back on his staff again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
55 
 
So it had its -- its pluses and mi nuses. But he used
 me also to transl ate 
his messages to the -- the 
prisoners whenever -- for instance,
 when Streicher arrived, Doenitz 
refused on behalf of the other 
prisoners, to eat in the same  di
ning room with Streicher. Well th
en Andrews wrote a me ssage to 
be delivered to them, and I -- of 
course I translated that and read the me ssage to the prisoners and 
-- which we told them it -- you have no choice. 
I mean, he™s your boy and you™re going to eat 
with him whether you like it or not, cause you™re 
all alike. We ™re not looking at you as a grand 
admi ral, or you as a Reichsma rshall. We ™re looking 
at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and 
that™s what Streicher is, and you™re going to eat 
in the same  dining room, and that was it. That -- 
that™s the kind of me ssage that
 Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding 
crop that he carried all the time. High polished bo
ots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin™ 
image of General Patton when it came to dress an
d bearing and he loved 
to play the commanding 
officer, which some ti me s the Nazis u-used against 
all of us in a humorous sense. For instance, 
one general, I forget what his name  was, had 
not -- Andrews came walki
ng into the room and -- 
and the general didn™t stand up a
nd click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the 
baseme nt room which Andrews kept for solitary c
onfinement. And then he wrote an order that 
whenever he walked into a room they were to 
stand up at attention and 
-- and salute him. We ll, 
they carried it to the other extr
eme so whenever any one of us entered the room they did the 
same  thing. And it got to be sort of humorous, here
 I was a first lieutenant and if they were all 
sitting on the vera -- veranda in
 the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of
 these guys, and I would come  
back from lunch and walk it up -- they would a
ll stand up and click their 
heels and bow, and say 
good afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know. And it got
 to be a joke until they got tired of it, 
but we had a -- light mome nts with them too. Bu t we did convince Andrews finally to let us do 

our -- our thing, as long as the pr
isoners didn™t violate 
any of the rules he™d
 go along with it, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
56 
 
that was one of the challenges. Other than that, 
our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of 
-- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pret
ended to be the welfare officer. We ll, I was the 
welfare officer because I ma de the rounds. I woul
d go from room to room and I would ask the 
prisoner how -- how are you today, a
nd at first they were very bus
y writing letters to General 
Eisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they
 were heads of state, or former heads of 
state. And they were complaining about thei r 
treatment and making dema nds. And our job was to 
translate those letters, send them -- send them
 out through channels. 
And we never got any 
replies, I assume they™re still 
going through channels. But -- so if
 they had a letter that they 
wanted to write to some one, they would give it to
 me to translate for th
em, and send it on. Or if 
they wanted to locate their family. You know, 
I -- I don™t know where my  wife is, could you try 
to find out where she is?  And we would, which is ve
ry simp le thing because for instance, a lot of 
them lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to th
em as the bunsin, the big 
-- the big boys -- a lot of 
the Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster.
 Ma-Many of them had their villas at Tegernsee 
in Bavaria. So if Kesserling wanted to locate hi
s wife the last time he heard from her, we could 
contact a military unit of ours stationed near Tege
rnsee and ask them to investigate. And we got 
to the point where we could some times forward le
tters. And that helped tremendously in getting 
their cooperation and telling me things that -- th
at we wanted to hear. So I would ma ke the 
rounds and -- and some body would say, I don™t ha
ve any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an 
extra ration of toothpaste, sham
poo, or I have a dandruff problem
. Goering had a skin problem 
and he always -- he wanted special lotions and 
special soaps, which we couldn™t furnish, but at 
least I listened to his complain
ts and -- and by listening and symp
athizing with him, that -- that 
helped pave the way. Wh at happened then was th
at every one of us ha
d a specialty. I really 
specialized in the German general™s st aff. The hist
ory of the German general™s staff, and so forth. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
57 
 
So a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategi es and 
organization and so forth. With the result that ea
ch one of the five of us would have only a 
certain number of prisoners unde
r their jurisdiction 
and they wouldn™t get to know anything 
about any of the others. Well, I was the welfare 
officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even 
though I never interrogated them. But I would g-
go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing, 
how do you feel?  And I would end up 
getting a lot of information 
that helped my performance, 
because I kept this gossip file a
bout one s -- pr isoner said about th
e ot her. But one in particular 
stands out, was old Papa Schwar
tz, Franz Xavier Schwartz, was 
called Papa Schwartz. He was 
the Nazi party treasurer. Simple, 
kind old guy, really. He didn™t know what the score was. But he 
was a very popular politician in Bavaria and Hitle
r used him to collect the dues. If you belong to 
the Nazi party, you paid yo-your party dues. And th
at™s all Schwartz did, 
he collected dues. And 
now you think Nazi party treasurer
 would have been a very im
portant guy, who certainly would 
have a lot to do with buying property and -- a
nd receivi ng big contributions. That wasn™t 
Schwartz™s job, that was some body else™s responsib
ility. That was Funk, and to a certain extent 
at first, Schacht. So Schwartz, I don™t 
even know why we -- we brou -- he was never 
interrogated. He really 
served no particular purpose. And hi
s son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr. was 
the president of Ger man brewerie
s, which really had no particular
 connection, but he did have a -
- a paramilitary rank in th -- either  the SS or 
the SA. A lot of people, if you ma de a big 

contribution financially, if you 
were an industrialist, you wo
uld got a -- get a rank like a 
sturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing mo
re than an honorary title, and i -- and you 
could -- got to wear a 
uniform. So if you were
 president of the brew
eries, you could wear a 
uniform as a  brigadier general in
 the SS, but you really had nothing to do in the SS. But it did put 
him in the automa tic arrest category, because everybody who was an SS officer was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
58 
 
automa tically arrested by us. So we ended up w
ith a lot of these deadbeats. Well, Schwartz 
looked very much like my father, physical image. My
 father had sort of a white mustache, little 
[indecipherable] like Hindenburg. And Schwartz looke
d like my father and the first time  I went 
in to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because 
it looked almost like my own papa sitting there. 
And he noticed that and wanted to know 
what -- you know, what ma de you -- he said -- 
upshraken wa s the German word, la -- what ma de you pull back. And just in a mo me nt  of candor 
I said, ﬁW-Well, because you look very much like 
my father.ﬂ And then I showed him a picture 
of my father. And he -- he started 
to cry, he got -- he -- he got very
 emotional about that. He th -- 
he thought that was just a wonderf
ul coincidence. He™s -- he™s 
a Roma n Catholic, he was very 
devout, and he thought surely that 
God had ordained for this to 
happen. Well, I -- I had to take 
advantage of that because all the other prisoners
 kind of looked upon ov -- 
Schwartz as almost a 
father confessor. And they would go to Papa Sc
hwartz and tell him things that they didn™t tell 

anybody else, especially after an -- an interroga
tion. They were going to Papa Schwartz and say, 
well they asked me about this, but I told them th
at, but the trut h of the matter is. Well then, after 
I showed -- after wa -- won the c
onfidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he™d say, don™t 
trust so and so. And he would -- he
 would tell me things about what
 the prisoner had said to him.  
And it was that kind of play that -- that resulted
 in our getting more information than we really 
knew how to cope with, in addition to our offi
cial interrogation. We  wor ked for the Nazi war 
crimes commission, which was headed by Supreme 
Court Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be 
our prosecutor for the United States. And they we
re located in Paris. And -- and this was his 
staff, th-the general, General Telford Tayl
or, and Colonel Amon and others who were the 
assistant prosecutors. And they would ma ke up ques
tionnaires, what they wanted to know about 
a certain pr isoner. They were preparing the case 
for the prosecution against, say Karl Doenitz, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
59 
 
Grand Admi ral Doenitz. So they 
had questions about him. Wa s he 
present when this particular 
treaty was signed?  Wa s he there when -- at th
e Wannsee conference when the final solution was 
decided on?  And then we would get those quest
ionnaires, and then we
 would have a staff 
meeting. And Captain Sensnik w
ould say, okay, we have a questi
onnaire on Doenitz, Dolibois, 
you -- you handle that one. And then I would -- I w
ould get that questionnaire and then I would 
prepare my i nterrogation of Doenitz, the intent be
ing to get the answers to
 those questions, but -- 
but building it around a autobiographi
cal sketch sort of thing. And 
these were very fascinating 
because the prisoner would brag
 about his accomplishments, what he had done and everythi ng. 
And in the course of that you could work in th
e pas -- specifi c questions 
that colonel -- Justice 
Jackson wanted answered for his staff. And this 
is what ma de  the -- it™s kind of a -- a -- an 
interesting challenge, an in
terrogation. Well that was the j
ob of each interrogator. We ™d 
interrogate and some ti mes it would go on fora week, you™d do nothing but interrogate one 
prisoner, then spend the afte
rnoon writing up your report. 
Q: L-L-Let me  ask you just specific
ally, were you taking hand notes -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- or was there someone 
there taking notes, not -- 
A: That™s the wor -- no, that™s 
the worst thing you could do.  
Q: Because they would [indecipherabl e] 

A: Psychologically you would -- they would 
freeze up, ooh, he™s writing that down. I™m not 
going to tell him that, that™s going 
to go on a record. Conversation is 
what they really wanted to 
know. And -- and they would just -- a -- this mean
t -- this is why I said
 it™d go on for a week, 
because you™d interroga te ma ybe for an hour, and then you spend two or three hours putting 

together what you -- you had. Part of our training 
was to pick out pertinent facts to reme mber, to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
60 
 
put down in our -- in our reports. Sometimes we™d
 take a break and then quickly jot down the 
things that I want to reme mber and then contin
ue the interrogation, and then from the jotted 
notes later. But if you sat there with a pencil 
and asked questions, they freeze, and they would -- 
but if they could just go on a
nd -- and ex -- expound on what they had accomplished, and I did 
this and I did that and thanks to me  this wa
s done. And that™s the sort of thing we were 
encouraging. 
Q: Now tell me , were they not suspicious of you five guys walking around talking with them?  

A: Well, they knew it -- fi rst of all, they didn™t 
believe if they were anything but prisoners of 
war. To tell them, you™re going to have a trial, an
d you™re going to be tried, 
that is something that 
-- that was ri -- in the book. There™s nothing in
 the Geneva Convention or the Wa rsaw Treaty 
that says if you lose the war 
and you™re arrested and you become
 a prisoner, you mi ght be tried 
for your crimes. I mean, what -- what is a war 
crime?  That had never 
been decided until the 
Nuremberg trial. And then it isn™t quite clear. 
Look what we™re doing now. I mean, nobody really 
knows what a war crime is. This -- this busine
ss in The Hague going on now with international 
criminal court, they haven™t defined a war crim
e as yet. When some body i n Bosnia, a Serb, rapes 
a -- a Muslim woma n, i s that a wa
r crime? Or is it a cr ime against humanity? What international 
court is going to try that per 
-- well, these are the 
-- the philosophical, lega
l things that hadn™t 
come  up. So these people didn™t expect to be trie
d. They were prisoners of war, special prisoners 
of war because of their high ra
nk in -- in the government, or 
-- and therefore sometimes they 
would tell you things that they 
wished they hadn™t to
ld you when they finally went to trial. The 
trial in itself really wasn™t deci ded, the specifi cs
 of it, until an agreement was reached I think 
some ti me  in July or August of 1945. Back in Ma
y when we were beginning to interrogate these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
61 
 
me n, nobody knew that there was goi
ng to be a trial, per se. We knew that some thing was going 
to happen. 
Q: But you didn™t know what. 

A: But we had to get a lot more information befo
re that decision could be reached. And that was 
really the function of the detention center Ashcan
 in Luxembourg, to sort of gather information 
to assist the prosecuting sta
ff in developing a case -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- which then would be s -- like a grand jur
y, yes?  A crime has been co mmitted, so now this 
person is going to be tried for it. A-And that is
 the -- the function. And we
 were the investigators 
for the so-called grand jury, the war crimes co
mmission. Now in my case, in addition to getting 

these interrogation, I would 
-- I would go around and -- and 
collect gossip of what 
[indecipherable] and do them little favors, you know, 
if -- if the shoestring broke, I™d get them 
another shoestring. Just little si
mple things, little toothpaste, 
a -- or if they had a problem, you 
know, I™ve a got a toothache, I™d arrange for the den
tist to see them, and -- and in that way they -
- they just started talking. Ne
ver -- no, I shouldn™t say never, se
ldom, about themselves, when it 
came to I™m guilty of this, or I™m guilty of that, or -- I knew about concentration camps, for 

instance. But they would say, oh, Dachau, yeah, there was a pl ace like -- ask so and so. He was 

involved in that, a-and -- you know, this was the 
kind of leads that would help us in our 
interrogation. So our summer travai
l -- travails in -- in Luxembour
g was primarily to get to know 
the prisoners, their character, their personalities, 
which would help the prosecutors in developing 
their approach when they tried them, and also fo
r historical purposes. We
 had a lot of historic 
war cri -- wa r departme nt commissioned historians 
who wanted to interrogate these prisoners. So 
many ti mes we would have a -- a professor from t he Hoover Institute or  so me other think tank, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
62 
 
who was working on a particular aspect of th
e wa r history that would come  and we would 
interrogate on their behalf, they would sit in 
on it, but they couldn™
t speak German. And we 
would interrogate the prisoner, and get the inform
ation they wanted for their hi stor ical prese -- 
Q: And how would you explain that 
visit to the prisoner, just -- 
A: We  tell them the truth. Say this ma n is an historian -- 
Q: And then when -- 

A: -- and he™s writing the history of the tank -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- as used by the German comma nd. A-And the -- the tactics that Rommel used in -- in Africa, 

or Goodarian in his tank warfare. And 
oh yes, they™ll tell you all about that.  
Q: Because this ma de them -- 

A: Yeah, because it -- it -- they could -- this 
is how they were important. They could build up 

their own importance. It™s -- you ge
t that once in awhile in a crime that is committed where the 
criminal is willing to brag about how ma ny pe
ople he has killed, or  how many banks he has 
robbed, because this is the wa
y he builds up his own ego.  
Q: Give -- within the context -- I mean, in your
 autobiography you clearly 
name  so ma ny of the 
people. Could you just give whoever™s watching th
is o -- some list of th
e names of these pri -- 
there were -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- 51 people at the -- 
at the height of the -- 
A: Yeah, at -- we had, altogether 
I think, total, we  -- we kept a -- 
a daily roster of the newcomers 
arrivals. Gains -- gains and losses we called them
. And the -- and the total number of German 
prisoners who came through this process at nu
r -- at Luxembourg was 86. That just about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
63 
 
encompasses everybody who was anybody in the Nazi 
regime. They would stay with us ma ybe a 
few weeks. We had another place near Wi esba
den, it was called Dustbin. And some body had a 
good sense of humor, between Ashcan and Dustbin, I 
like to say we all got 
a lot of trash between 
Ashcan and Dustbin. So some body at -- at Wi es
baden would -- would want to interrogate a 
certain prisoner we had in Mondorf and we -- that 
prisoner would be with us, and then we™d se -- 
Albert Speer, for instance, Speer was traveling al
l over Europe  because people in Paris wanted to 

interrogate him and then he was up in Wi esbaden 
and then he went some where else, some  other 
installation. Wherever we had a 
military unit working on something 
particularly interesting for 
that prisoner, we™d move  him out. 
So, nevertheless, the prisoners we
re di vi ded into three distinct  
categor ies. We had me mbers of the German ge
neral™s staff. A field ma r s hall -- a generale 
fieldmarshall, General Fieldmarshall Keitel, th
e chief of the arme d forces high comma nd, the 
equivalent to Colin Powell as the chairman of Jo
int Chiefs of Staff, in that position. He  was 
undoubtedly the highest ranking of the Nazi gene ra
ls. And I call hi m a Nazi general because he 
was a me mber of the general™s staff who was a N
azi. He wouldn™t have been the ch -- with his 
limited ability, he would never have been the ch
airman or the -- not chairman, but the -- the 
commander in chief of the arme d for ces high co
mmand if he  hadn™t been a Nazi and ardent 
Hitler supporter. So we ha d Keitel. His deputy, Jo
dl, generale august Jodl
, Alfred Jodl, was the 
chief of operations. Under Jodl it was War
limont, Walter Warlimont, who was my special 

project when I worked on the history of that Ge
rman general staff. He wa s very cooperative. He 

was Colonel Geito, who commanded the [indecipher
able] during the Spanish revolution when 

the German -- German army was in -- a German
 military was supporting Franco in -- in Spain. 
He was a very interesting guy, spoke English flue
ntly, had ma rried an American girl whom he 
had me t whe n he was attendin -- attending our army
 war college in 1928, and he -- he was a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
64 
 
helpful individual. He was present at the 
attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20
th
, ™44, and 
was seriously wounded, a brain injury. So he ha
d a me dical discharge, which saved him from 
becomi ng one of the people -- probably he would 
have been tried at Nuremberg. But  he got a 
me dical discharge and he was out of it after July 20
th
, ™44. So a lot of the things that happened 
later on during the war, the -- the 
real war crimes, the viol ations 
of -- of the Wa rsaw Treaty and 
Geneva Convention, u -- Wa rlimont was out of it
. Now he wa s very cooperative and he helped 
us in -- in many ways, and I me ntion in my 
book an expedition I ma de with him to get an 
connection with the history of th
e general™s staff, and -- and War
limont was -- was a big help to 
me  in gathering information. And he was never trie
d. And in fact, he was re
le -- re -- released 
after a couple of months at Nuremberg and wasn™t 
even around when the trials started. We ll, then 
there was Ge neral Blaskowitz, and there was vonWoonstadt, leader of the Battle of the Bulge, 
von Blumberg, a former chief of staff. These were
 me mbers of the German general staff, career, 
high ranking, elite. In some cases me n of princi
ple because they belonged to the hi ghest social 
class you but -- you could belong to in Germany, the 
ger -- genralshtapper, th
at was it. But with a 
few exceptions, they were not neces
sarily in sympathy with the Nazi
 way of doing things, at least 
as far as we could tell. I don™t 
think we could ever link von Blumbe
rg, who was a victim of -- of 
Hitler™s doings -- von Blumberg was kicked out 
on a manufactured st ory and Keitel took his 
place because  Keitel polished the appl e and did what Hitler wa nted. You couldn™t hold those 

guys responsible for the atrocities
 because they really were not a part of that. [indecipherable] 
wouldn™t have been tried under those circumstances
. So they were very cooperative in working 
with us, and if you did come  to a point where you 
were discussing war crimes, or tried to weave 
them into the atrocity aspect, their answer was 
always, hey, I was just a soldier. I -- I followed 
command. Keitel is the guy who wa s th
e -- the chief of the arme d 
forces high comma nd, talk to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
65 
 
him. The admi rals, Grand Admi ral Doenitz, who wa
s the successor to Hitler and Grand Admi ral 
Raeder, commander in chief the German navy, were
 part of this, they were me mbers of the 
German general™s staff, and they were in that
 category. In the second group we had what I call 
the real Nazi trash. The leader of
 which, of course, would be Juliu
s Streicher, the Jew baiter, who 
prided hims elf of being a racist. And he, to the ve
ry end he was beating hi
s chest with pride, I™m 
-- I™m the leading racist , I™m -- I™m a [indeciphe
rable] he called hims
elf a [indecipherable] 
mi nister. Hasa, the word -- German for hate, and 
rasa, the word for race, of course, y-you could 
just see that in -- in Streicher 
right from the beginning. Streicher, 
gaolighter Franconia, publisher, 
editor, pornographic anti-Semitic newspaper, Der 
Sturme r. Robert Ley, La bor fr ont leader, who 
succeeded in strangling himself before the trials 
began. Leader of the arbe itsfront, the German 
labor front. You couldn™t get a job in Germany 
without belonging to the labor front. Fr itz 
Sauckel, who was the procurement officer for bri
nging in slave labor to work in Albert Speer™s 
factories and mi nes and 
munitions industries and to build 
up the war machine and maintain it 
during the war. Arthur Se yss-Inquart, who betr
ayed Austria, later became the military governor 

of the Netherlands. Baldur von Schirach, the Hi
tler youth leader. Hans Frank, the butcher of 
Poland, governor gene ral of Poland, who was willi
ng to admit that he signed the documents 
responsible for the execution of mor e  than two 
and a half million Jews in -- in Auschwitz and 
Birkenau and the other camps in Poland, for which he had the responsibility. And in this 

particular case, confessed it, admitted it. Let™s se
e, in that category were me n like Kaltenbrunner, 
Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the successor to the hangm
an Heydrich, who had -- was assassinated in 
Czechoslovakia as you know. I me ntioned Hans Frank -- 

Q: Rosenberg -- 

A: -- some  others come  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
66 
 
Q: Rosenberg, was that -- 
A: Oh yeah, wi -- Alfred Rosenbe
rg, of course, the N
azi philosopher. Hess would have been in 
that category, but of course he sat in prison 
in England and didn™t join us until Nure mberg. But 
he would have been in that par
ticular group as we ll. These were 
the ultercamfer, the old fighters 
who helped Hitler come  to 
power, who were with him during the putsc h in 1923. And he 
reordered them with the positions of -- that  had 
the power of life and death, the gaolighters who 
could send people to the concentrat
ion camp without trial, send th
em off. They were the people 
who had limited intelligence. Streicher had the lowest IQ. 

Q: Really? 

A: Julius Streicher had the IQ of 106, the lowest 
IQ of the 22 Nazis tried 
in the first session of 
tribunal. Lot of them had -- la
cked even a sound education. Sauc
kel never went beyond the fifth 
grade, but they had the power of life and death. 
They were the -- the Hitler henchmen who had 

helped --  helped Hitler in the ri se of the party. In the third category were the -- the bureaucrats, 
Meisner, Lame rs, Schterlein, 
Selter, von Popha m, Admi ral [ind
ecipherable] of Hunga ry. These 
were the mi nisters and secretaries who ran the 
German government. Some of them were active 
during the Kaiser™s regime  in World Wa r 
1
. They changed thei r political affiliation duri ng the 
Wei mar republic and kept their cushioned jobs. When Hitler came along, they became Nazis and 
kept their governme nt jobs. Probably if they™d 
been there long enough for Stalin to come  along, 
they™d have become  communists. 

Q: So they were opportunists? 

A: They were opportunists. They went with wh
atever political wind was blowing. So when you 
take all these people,put them under one roof, you get a r
eal mi x, and y-you -- you tend to have 
a cliquish development, where they just set 
off in groups by themselves. And that, from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
67 
 
psychology of interrogation was very much in our 
favor, because we just played one off against 
the other. We wanted to know about the generals
, they told us all they
 knew about the Nazis. 
And if we wanted to know about 
the Nazis we asked the -- the st
atesme n, or vice versa, we could 
-- and in that respect they were more cooperative th
an we wanted them to be because it just ma de 
us work that much harder. I mean, the more information we got, the harder we had to work in 
writing it all up. So -- 

Q: After you™re there for a couple 
of weeks doing this, is -- does 
this wear on you, having to talk 
with these folks?   

A: Definite -- definitely so. And it got to the 
point where just living in the same building with 
them was a real hardship and soon, within three 
or four weeks after I go
t there, we moved out. 
And we would just come  to work in the morn
ing, do our interrogation, and our -- our write-ups 
and do our office work and then at five o™clockgo home , and -- unless we had a visitor that we 

had an evening interrogation with a special
 commission coming up. A-And -- and that was 
necessary for your own state of mi nd because fr
ankly, you got -- you got tire
d of the smell of it 
all. It was -- even in -- in 
what used to be a luxury hotel, it 
had a prison smell, most of all 
because sanitary conditions weren™t such that 
these guys could take a shower every mor ning, and 
they didn™t have fresh clothing to put on. Y
ou know, they were wearing, a lot of times, the 
clothes that they were taken prisoner in, and mont
hs later they™re st ill w
earing the same  clothes. 
Now we did try to -- we had a prison laundry, bu
t the laundry service wa
sn™t exactly a resort 
hotel style. That whole atmos
phere, you never really had the pr
ivacy. You couldn™t just walk 
from my office in room 32, I coul
dn™t just walk down a hall and 
go to Captain Sensnik™s office 
without meeting one of the prisoners ma ybe
 along the way who wanted to gripe about 
some thing, or had a question about some thing, 
or who wanted some thing. And you kind of got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
68 
 
tired of seeing them. They™re under 
foot all the time . So we needed
 to get away. That definitely 
was -- was necessary. And in my case, personally,
 because I was playing this role of welfare 
officer, I was seeing more of them than the 
other officers were. Consequently, you had the 
wearing -- wearing thin happened 
a lot quicker with me , probably, th
an it di d with the ot hers. But 
we all had the same  feeling. If I never see anot
her Nazi again I™ll be pe
rfectly happy. That was 
sort of the -- the slogan
 we all adopted there. 
Q: But you also had to appear kind of sympatheti
c. You were not just asking questions and trying 
to get answers. You were creati
ng an atmosphere so that they 
would trust you. That puts you in a 
-- almost a schizophrenic
 situation, that™s -- 
A: Yes. Yeah, that wa --  that was the other as
 -- especially in cases where fa milies who were 
involved. Now I did visit -- I didn™t begin to vi si
t, actua lly, fa milies, until we moved out of 
Luxembour g and went to Oberhausen. And a part 
of the group went to Oberhausen, mostly the 
general officers and then others we
nt directly to Nuremberg. Then 
I went from Oberhausen to -- 
excuse me, to Nuremberg. But during that period, when I started seei ng families with children, 

even Edda Goering and -- and Herman Goering w
ould write a letter to hi
s daughter, and I would 
read his letter to his daughter si
tting on my lap, and that had to 
get to me , and -- but the difficulty 
-- and I think this is where our training at Ri
chie was emphatic, on this don™t get personally 
involved. Don™t show sympathy, don™t show under
standing even in body language. And we were 
trying not to agree, not to nod your head when they ma de one  of their profound statements which 

mi ght make them think, he agrees with me. He woul
d have done the same  thing if he were in my 
shoes. You had to avoid giving them an opportunity 
to transfer their doings 
to you -- their -- their 
philosophy. In other words, yeah, he ma y be the 
enemy, but he agrees with me , cause I saw him 
nod his head, or I saw him s mile when I said that. 
So we had to learn to be very impersonal and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
69 
 
stone faced, and not to let ourselves be moved 
by -- by what they -- they said, or what they 
some ti me s did. So body language is very important 
in talking to them, especially someone -- I -- 
I -- I like to move my ha nds when I™
m talking so it was very diffi cult to
 -- to sort of sit still and -- 
and -- and just listen. Little thi
ngs, like Herr Streicher, a ma n who couldn™t talk for five mi nutes -
- oh, two mi nutes, without becomi ng anti-Semitic. Ev
ery conversation would lead into his hatred 
of the Jews. Whether he thought that some ti me s 
you felt like giving him a real argument, or even 
punching him in the mo uth, because his convers
ation coul d rub you the wrong way. He was a 
foul mouth to begin with, a-and hi
s -- his language was just uncout
h. So that was difficult to just 
tolerate. But that same  man, when his wife Adel
e came to the prison, and I told him -- your wife 
-- now, they couldn™t have visito
rs, and this happened in Nuremberg, not -- not in Luxembourg, 
but I take that out of sequence here. I told him, 
your wife is here, what do you want me to tell 
her?  And our purpose for being -- for playing this
 role was to get information. We  wa nted to 
know more about th-the prisoner, 
about his family. Sometime s the 
wife would tell us -- tell us 
things about his activities that he
 hadn™t revealed, just through 
a short, 10 mi nute visit. When I 
told him his wife was there, and that™s the only ti
me  she ca me to visit, he gave me  a me ssage for 
her, telling me  she should visit 
hospitals and visit the sick and do 
whatever she could to help any 
orphan children. We ll, he was obviously playing up to me . I don™t -- 

Q: This was Streicher? 

A: Streicher. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I -- I can™t believe that he really wa s that 
concerned, because if -- if you read my report on 
him, he™s not the kind of a guy who would worry about orphans. But then he suddenly walked up 

to me , and he put his arm on my -- my -- his hand on 
my arm right here. And he just held it there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
70 
 
for a mo me nt and I di dn™t know what to ma ke of
 t his because we had no physical contact, we 
never shook hands, and we never addressed them 
by their -- their titles, it was always Herr 
Streicher. And they very seldom knew our name s , 
even so that they couldn™t call us by name , 
unless they specifically asked, then you told th
em your name , but we used false name s anyhow. 
But he put his hand right here on my arm and for 
a mo ment I didn™t know what to ma ke of this, 
and he held it there. And then he stepped back 
and he said, ﬁWhen you see my wife, tell her to 
put her hand in the same place on your arm, so we 
can be -- so we can be close to each other.ﬂ 
Now, that sort of thing haunts you because it
 comes from a man who you™ve already decided, 
hard-hearted, cold, the originator of the Nurembe r g Laws, his pornographi c, anti-Semitic 

newspaper. But then a gesture like that catche
s you completely unawares.
 And -- and there were 
incidents like that in their correspondence or 
their conversation where you -- you had to really 
steel yourself to avoid being sympathetic or givi
ng the impression that yeah, I think you have a 
point. I agree with you. So -- 
Q: Wo w. 
A: Right. 

Q: At -- at what point in the -- in the work at 
Ashcan -- which is such a great name  for where you 
were, did you really understand about the genoci
des?  About the sort of factory-like killing of 
Jews, and the mobile killing operations, and th
e concentration camp system. Wa s that very 
quick?  

A: Well actually, that aspect of it, to me pers
onally, didn™t come  to li
ght -- now, two of my 
colleagues were Jewish, two of about
 five officers. And one of them
 had lost his -- his parents at 
Auschwitz. He knew, he -- he knew the sa -- a-an
d -- and the -- the tales 
he -- but his knowledge 
of it was limited to his own fa mily expe
rience. He had no idea of what -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
71 
 
Q: Of the scope of it. 
A: -- the bi g scope, the bi g pict ure of this was. 
That really di d -- didn™t begi n develop until I got 

to Nuremberg and began to see some  of the evidence -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- the films. German films. 

Q: Right. 

A: Their own films captured, and began to see so
me  of the documents, i -- which -- which came  
to our intention in the course of an interrogati
on because questions that we re give n to us were 

based on the documents that we were asked to -- 
the existence of which we were asked to verify, 
the signatures which we wanted to authenticate a
nd ma ke -- verify as well. That™s when I began 
to -- to learn the atrocities. Th
en after the trials began, I did 
have the opportunity, after I left 
Nuremberg a-at my strong, urgent
 request -- but I did go back to Nuremb erg time  to time to 
finish a project with a particul
ar general officer, of the genera
le staff. And I would attend a 
session and I would hear the evid
ence. For instance, this ma n He
rse, I heard his testimony. And I 
think that wa s one of the first time s I really real
ized how vast this thing was, it -- it wasn™t just 
one individual™s doings that led to
 a certain crime, or an atrocity, 
this is really a ma chine, a -- a 
whole -- this was a governme nt actio
n. Thi -- this weren™t just isolat
ed incidents. And it wasn™t 
until really the trials began that 
-- that that came to my -- to my 
attention. There™s a -- a -- a very 
serious incident I me ntion in -- in my  book, one I™ve had first hand, for the very first time , 

outside of that brief exposure to Dachau, I d -- 
I didn™t see any more evid
ence of the atrocities 
until we met a convoy and one particular incident
, a convoy of seven two and a half ton trucks 
loaded with bodies being shifted from one ma ss grave 
to another. I think I poi
nt to that particular 
incident  even more so than my fi rst vi sit to Dachau
 as the -- the turning poi
nt. I realized that this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
72 
 
was more than just one crime by one ma n, or one 
adventure that one or 
two people participated 
in, this -- this is ma ss -- ma ss production. 
Q: I -- I want to ask you about some  of these 
particular me n that you were talking with in 

Mondorf but -- but let me  ask you some thing. 
When -- when you would do your rounds, you 
obviously couldn™t see everybody each day -- 

A: Oh no, no. 

Q: -- right? 

A: No. 

Q: So you would pick -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- I would suppose -- 

A: Yeah, just a -- 

Q: -- a group of people. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And how long would you spend with each of
 these folks?  Would it vary?  Would it be 10 
mi nutes sometimes -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- an hour another time?  

A: It -- it would depend on the individual. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: If he was an interesting person I™d want to be -- spend more time  with him.  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
73 
 
A: Frankly, von Ribbentrop, I found him very a -- 
very repulsive, very annoying. He wa -- he 
was a -- i -- i -- he was a nervous wreck. He was 
-- annoying is a good way to put -- he got -- he 
gots on your nerves, you -- you™ve me
t people who get on your nerves? 
Q: Yes, yes. 
A: We ll, von Ribbentrop was that wa y. So if I 
went to see von Ribbentrop, it would be very 
brief. And I didn™t go see him regularly at all, and 
ma ybe I -- I talked to him five or six times in 
the course of that summer -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- because he didn™t interest me . Rosenberg 
was another one like that, he was a - a nervous 
twitcher, he always had -- had some thing he 
had to fiddle with, and -- and he had all these 
nervous facial gestures. And -- and he 
was again some body whose compa ny you didn™t 
particularly enjoy or find interesting. So 
those people you -- you avoided, I -- I would spend 
more time with some body like Papa Schwartz or 
Warlimont. Keitel intrigued me  because he was 
such a pompous idiot that I sort of always felt su
perior when I talked to Keitel. Yet, he was a 
general field ma rshall, you know, five
 star general, I was just a fi
rst lieutenant, but -- [tape break, 
music] -- very painful it was, how he hadn™t been
 able to sleep a wink. A
nd I said why didn™t you 
tell the guard, we had a guard, all he had to do wa
s call th -- call the guard. 
He could walk out of 
his room and tell the guard in th
e hall that he wanted to see th
e doctor. Well, he was a general 
field ma rshall, he wasn™t going to tell an ordi
nary enlisted ma n that he had a boil on his neck. 
He™d rather suffer all night long 
and wait until an officer came, so 
he could say officer to officer. 
Well, my re action to that was, good, I hope the 
boil really gave you a pain. S-So that was a 
different kind of a visitor. And then there we
re -- Streicher fascinated
 me because it was like 
going to a zoo and -- and watching a particularly 
strange animal because he™s repugnant in one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
74 
 
sense, but you can™t take your eyes off hi m. I liked 
to spend time  with Streicher, just to see him -
- hear hi m rant and rave until I got bored, and 
then I -- I would leave him. Ley was another 
come dian.  

Q: Comedian? 

A: Come dian. Ley was -- well, first of all, he 
stammered. He stamme red -- he -- he stuttered 
occasiona lly only on a letter. Like, my name  is
 ho -- h-ho -- ho -- [tape break, ad for USN] -- 
look at -- h-he would say, if I c
ould have some of that good Amer
ican whiskey, it would [speaks 
German here] it would loosen my tongue. 

Q: Loosen my tongue. 

A: Yeah, it -- ma ke a s mooth talker out of him.  

Q: But you also said in your book that he was neve
r sensible, he didn™t -- there was no sensible 

conversation out of him.  

A: No, you couldn™t. That™s why I say he was a 
come dian. He -- he woul
d just -- you would end 
up laughing, he would amuse you, without tryi ng 
to amuse you, because he  took himself very 
seriously. He felt that he -- he 
really was a creator, he had bi
g ideas, and he did, but he didn™t 
have the ability to carry them out. He  could fa
ntasize and he wa s going to reconstruct Ge rmany 
and bring in all the Jews that ha
d left Germany and bring them b
ack and make up to the Jews the 
persecution and the atrocities th
at we  had enforced on them. And give them a chance to help 
reorganize a-and reconstruct Germany with himself 
in charge. And he™d be willing to do it out of 
his prison cell in Nuremb erg. 

Q: Oh really? 

A: Course, he™d like to have it fixed up a little bit so it™d be more comfortable, but -- but he™d be 

perfectly willing to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
75 
 
Q: To do that. 
A: -- to direct the whole thing. But this sort 
of nonsense, he was good at. When we fi nally told 
him point blank that the allied --
 allied authorities were
 not about to accept his ma ster plan for 
the reconstruction of Germany, he became suicid
al. And that™s when we put a 24 hour guard on 
his cell. And this is in Nuremberg now.  

Q: Right. 

A: But he fooled the guard and -- and he did st
rangle himself. And I was 
on duty that night. I had 
the questionable pleasure of -- 
of cutting him down and calling for help, and -- and h-he had 
succeeded in ripping the strong edge of a towel, out 
of which he ma de a noose. And then he tore 
parts of his underwear, which he stuffed in 
his mou -- keeping in mi nd he™s under guard, 
some body™s watching him, with a spotlight  on him 
all night long. And he put the -- the fragments 
of his underwear in his mouth so he wouldn™t ga
g, put the noose around his neck, then went to 
the toilet. And when he sat on the toilet, only hi
s feet would show far -- from the viewpoint of 
the guard outside his door. Then he looped that
 noose over the flushpipe, stand pipe with a 
button on it to flush the toilet, came about yay hi
gh, and he put the noose ov
er, and then literally 
forced hims elf forward and strangled hims elf. Wh
en the guard gave the alarm because he™d been 
sitting on the toilet too long, I was the duty officer
 that night and I had th
e key to the cell. And 
when I opened it up, it wa s too late already, he was 
dead. Of course then we  got the doctors and 
everything else. Dr. -- a Swiss -- Zukli, a Swi
ss doctor performe d an autopsy on him and found a 
-- a dama ged brain. Part of his brain was dama ge
d, and that was the result of an -- he was a 
navigator in airplane in 
the Luft waffe i n Worl d War 
1
, which crashed. And that really is what 
resulted in his stuttering, stamme r, and also pr
obably is -- the way his 
mi nd functioned, he just 
wasn™t quite the same , so -- but -- but he was an in
teresting person to talk 
to from that standpoint, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
76 
 
cause you didn™t know what he was going to come  up w
ith next to get -- to pr
ovide a little levity 
in the -- the day™s operations. 
Q: Can I go back to Streicher a few mi nutes? 

A: But di -- he --  

Q: When he -- when -- when Streicher came into
 the Palace hotel, t-to Ashcan, and Doenitz 
come s up to you and says we da -- you know, we
™re not eating with th
is guy, he™s not comi ng 
into the dining room, right. 

A: No, no. 

Q: You -- you all end up -- you put him on another floor. 

A: Yes. 

Q: On a separate [indecipherable] 

A: Nobody wanted to room with him. 

Q: Right. 
A: But Ley was willing to -- we called them the Bobbsey Twins. 
Q: Really? 

A: Ley was the only one who was sympathetic to 
Streicher. So Ley said that he would -- he 
would be willing to room with Streicher. But we put
 Streicher at first into -- into -- on the second 
floor where there were no other prisoners, 
because nobody wanted to room with him and we 
didn™t have any more room upstairs. And then Stre
icher indicate -- Ley indicated that he™d be 

willing to room with Streicher, so we put the tw
o together , cause as I say, we had a purpose for 
wanting them to relate to each other, conversa
tion-wise and everythi ng else. Ley was very much 
taken with St reicher, he admi red him. But that fe
eling wasn™t particularly
 returned on Streicher™s 
part. He -- he didn™t -- Streicher didn™t part
icularly care for Le y, he -- he thought he was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
77 
 
weakling. He -- he wasn™t ma tch -- a ma sochist like
 Streicher was. Streicher was all muscle and -
- and show off masochist. But Ley was just a di
rect opposite, he was a wi mp. And so Streicher 
had this tendency to look down on Ley. But th
at was the only one -- the only two who -- who 
were willing to be together. And 
the dining room -- course they ha
d to eat together, but they had 
difficulty finding some body to -- to sit with them, 
unless there was no place, and they -- they had 
to sit with them. But there wa
s very little conversation betwee
n Streicher -- everybody despised 
him. I mean, they -- they just di
dn™t care for him, especially Go
ering, who was the one that filed 
charges against him, and brought him before the c
ourt, the Nazi court, which is -- Walter Buch, 
who was another one of our prison
ers that I didn™t me ntion. He wa
s the chief justice of the -- of 
the Nazi cour t, you know, the -- when a Nazi committed a crime against another Nazi, he was 

not tried in a criminal court, he was tried in 
a Nazi court, and Wa lter Buch was the superior 

judge of this -- this Nazi court. Buch, incide
ntally, was the father-in-law of Martin Bormann, 
who was Hitler™s adjutant  and the guy that pr etty 
much spoke for Hitler and signed a lot of orders 
that are still today being questioned as to th
e authenticity, did they come  fr om Bor mann or 
Hitler. So Bormann was a very important guy, yo
u know, he -- unfortunately we didn™t have him 
with us. And Buch was the father-in-law of this
 ma n, too. Another one th
at I didn™t mention who 
was part of that Nazi trash [i
ndecipherable] was Wilhel m Frick, 
who™d been sec -- Minister of 
the Interior and was really the guy who wrote the -- the original Nuremberg laws. The -- the law 

-- the legal --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- phrase -- phrases themselves, so -- 

Q: Let™s stop the tape now since it™s goi
ng to run out soon, and go to the next tape. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
78 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: -- to st art talking about Wilhelm Frick -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- and your experience with him, what kind 
of a person was he, and what was your experience 
in talking with him?  

A: He was a nonentity, I would say. And even 
the Nazis considered him a  -- a nobody. He was 
powerful because, you know, the Minister of the In
terior in Germany, even today in -- in ma ny 
European governme nts, is in charge of the po
lice force, and has a lot more power than the 
Secretary of the Interior does in -- in -- comparat
ively in the United Stat es. 
So the Minister of the 
Interior was truly a -- an important position. But 
once Hitler became the fuehrer, when he was -- 
you know, Hitler held three jobs. He  was the fuehrer, 
that™s the leader of th
e Nazi party, that was 
really the title fuehrer, and the one that he pr
eferred, which incidentally Streicher gave him. 
When they fi rst met, in a beer hall in -- in Muni
ch, and Streicher, who was the leader of an anti-
Se mitic faction in Nuremberg, heard about this 
labor party group in Munich, which was headed 
by Hitler. And he went to Munich to hear this
 man Hitler, about whom he had heard, speak. And 
he describes in his testimony, he
 thought he actually saw a halo
 around his head, he thought this 
is the Messiah, this is the ma n who is going to
 ser -- s-save Ge rmany, whereupon he went to 
Hitler, and sa id, ﬁYou are my fu
ehrer. I will follow you, and everythi ng I have is yours.ﬂ In his 
fa mous wor ds. And Streicher was one of the 
few me mbers of the inner party who could dootz 
Hitler, address him in the fa miliar German du.Streicher was one of the few who cou -- even 

Goering didn™t have that power, 
but Streicher could -- coul d do that
. And Hitler liked that fuehrer 

business, and it was Streicher, 
at their first meeting, who sugge
sted it to him. And it was the 
union of those two parties from Nuremberg and from
 Munich that made the -- the dare -- day ap 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
79 
 
-- the deutsche arbeit party of Munich a na
tional deutsche arbeit 
party, because the two 
communities me rged, thanks to Stre icher, which was why Streicher was pa rticular ly de ar to 
Hitler, and considered him very close, and vice versa. Well, Frick was important  at -- at  the 

beginning, and he was a -- I think he wanted to be
 the police, or he was the police commissioner 
in -- in Muni ch at the time of the putsch. And he
 was active in Hitler™s political  endeavors, and 
of course became one of the followers. And then he was elected to the Reichstag and Hitler 

became chancellor and named hi m Minist er of the 
Interior . But then when Himmler came  into 
the play, and took over the Gesta
po and the -- the -- the SS and a
ll -- all the polic
e duties and the 
security services went to Hi mmler and Frick re
ally had nothing to do. He -- his position was 
strictly a -- up until be yond 1935, he -- he was r
eally nobody. He really did -- di dn™t have much 
of a -- a role, and colorless, sort
 of a -- a gray aura about him. 
His whole appearance, gray hair, 
gray face and gray clot he s, he -- he  was just --
 in a bunch of people, he would never stand out. 
Even if there were only two people in a room, he  wouldn™t stand out. 
Q: Did he admit to being a racist? 
A: He wa -- 

Q: Did he admit to being a racist? 

A: We ll, ya-- 

Q: Do you reme mber? 

A: Yeah, well, yeah -- yes -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- but it was legal. You see, i-it was -- everythi
ng he did was legal. He  -- he was the -- a legal 
interpretation. And yes, of course the Jews had 
to be done away with because that wa s the law, 
and the Nuremberg laws, and no question about it. 
Now, if you say, did you have anything to do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
80 
 
with the concentration ca mp -- which incident ally
 was not a question we -- I don™t reme mber -- I 
don™t think I ever asked it of anybody, cause I really
 didn™t know. I -- I just
 -- wasn™t in my -- I 
think with St reicher, it 
-- it had to come  up, as I recall, o-
of his -- of his own volition. Where he 
would bring it up, but never the details, as 
far as people being a
bused or starved. The 
concentration camp, as Streicher e
xplained it to me , is very simp
le. Here were these communists, 
and these communists were causing 
a lot of problems -- I™m giving Streicher™s explanation. And 
so when the big election came al
ong, at which time Hitler was to 
be the pl ebiscite, when Hitler 
was to be the supreme being, the fuehrer of the 
political party and then
 the chancellor of the 
German Reich, which ran the governme nt, and then
 the president of the German Reich, after 
Hindenburg. So he was president, chancellor 
and fuehrer. Political, organizational and 
ceremonial. So he really had three 
jobs under the title of fuehrer. We
ll, when all of this came into 
being, the communists had to be concentrated ou
t of sight so that they couldn™t cause any 
problems. They were having demonstrations 
and disrupting political meetings, and the 
communists were causing problems. So they we
re put into school build
ings and even some  
abandoned factories, as a temporary measure to 
concentrate them out of s i ght where we could 
concentrate -- keep our eyes on them. Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was 
just convenient to keep them there. It turned 
out that ma ny of the communists were Jews, so it 
was natural for those communists,
 and those Jews to end up in the concentration camps. But you 
couldn™t keep them in these tempor
ary facilities, so he had to build
 facilities for them. And this is 
how Dachau came into being a concentration cam
p, to bring these people together from the 
school building and factories where 
they were tentatively kept, a
nd put them into one camp. Tha t  
of course was the beginning. The ultima te solution, 
of course was, as the camps grew bigger and 
more and more people ended up in them, and th
e problem of feeding them, and they could no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
81 
 
longer buy their way out of Ger many by surrenderingtheir property to the German regime , they 
had to come  up with a final solution, the final so
lution was extermination. And that, of course is 
when Birkenau and -- and Auschwitz and the ot
hers came in -- into being. And that was the 
whole pattern. Now Streicher took responsibilit
y only up to when the camps were built, like 
Dachau. And then points out that he actually at 
Christmastime, as a Christmas gift, a humane 
gesture on his part, to prove what a big heart he 
had, he actually arranged for the release of some  
of these people from concentration camps. Co
mmunists, never Jews. He never arranged for a 
Jew. And this -- I™m quoting him now, how proud 
he was, ﬁNobody could ever accuse me  of 

letting a Jew out of a concentration camp.ﬂ That 
had to be put in. That was part of his -- his 

ma ke-up. But he had a Christma s party and he  woul
d invite the families of these people that he 

was releasing from the concentr
ation camp. And they didn™t know
 it, the families didn™t know 
what was going to happen, neither did the prisoners. They were suddenly whisked away to some  

gym, or some public building, then the doors woul
d be opened, and the families, and the -- the 
inma tes would come  together. And you know, nine 
out of 10 of those would become  me mbers of 
the Nazi party in appr eciation. And this is why 
he  did it, because he was the goodwill -- a lot of 
these communists became  Nazis 
after he released them from the concentration camp.  
Q: That™s what he told you. 
A: That was one of his accomplishments and -- a
nd that was really his motivation, but he never 
let Jews out. That was his kins -- 
his principles. Well, Fr-Frick, as 
I said, his role in all of this 
was that he merely -- his job was to write the laws
, interpret the laws as Minister of the Interior, 

and to follow those laws. And nothing he did was ever illega l, according to him, he always 

followed the law. So he did not -- couldn™t under
stand why he was being 
put in with all these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
82 
 
other people who were -- who -- who went beyond 
the law, obviously, becau
se that resulted in 
all the atrocities.  
Q: How about Herman Goering?  Let -- let me
 quote -- quote you from your autobiography, you 
said he was the easiest  Nazi to interrogate. He 
was able, shrewd ma nager,
 brilliant and brave, 
ruthless and grasping. At times almos t  a pleasure to
 be with, at other times a pain in the ass. 
A: Exactly. 

Q: But it was always interesting to be  with him. 

A: Yup, well that -- 

Q: How about [indecipherable] 

A: -- that -- that is it in -- and I™ve saved th
at characterization because
 it -- it st ill fits in 
retrospect, looking back on it. And first of all, Go
ering did not fit any of 
the three categories that 
I me ntioned. Nor was he accepted in those three categories. Now, he was president of the 

Reichstag, which would put him in with the bu
reaucracy, wouldn™t it?  With the governme nt, the 
secretaries and the mi nisters. We ll, they didn™t 
accept hi m. They didn™t want him. He was not 
really one of them. So he  was shut out of 
that group, von Popham, and -- and Meisner, Selta, 
those, they wanted nothi ng to do with him. Firs
t of all, because he was promoted over their 
heads. They were the me n with experience and 
everything else, and here he -- overnight, he 
became the president of the Reichstag, he wasn™t
 really one of them. Military ma n, yes, seven 
star general, Reichsmarshall, the highest m
ilitary rank ever attained by anybody in hist ory, 
except Hannibal ma ybe. But he wasn™t me m -- a me mb
er of the German gene
ral™s st aff. He -- he 
was never considered the -- the red 
stripe of the generale™s staff. 
So they didn™t accept him, none 
of the generals wanted anything to do w
ith him. I mean, i ma gine a guy who, you know, who 

comes from the rank of a -- a lieu
tenant in the riktorfin squadr
on suddenly become s a seven star 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
83 
 
Reichsma rshall of the Re ich. And so there was je
alousy and there was lack of respect and they 
never took him seriously. And incompetence. Goer
ing was not a very competent ma n in a sense 
of organization and -- he -- he could talk a big 
show, but he could never deliver the goods. He 
really wasn™t a producer. So he was resented 
by the military and he wasn™t accepted. And he 
didn™t really fit into th
e Nazi element because he was above them all. He was strutting in his 
uniforms and make -- making himself super rich 
by his acquisitions of art and [i ndecipherable] 
and special train. And then of c
ourse the -- the four year plan 
and the Herman Goering werker. 
So he™s also an industrialist, in
 addition to being the huntma ster 
of Germa ny, in addition to being 
the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe. So the 
other Nazis never considered him part of their 
group, even though he had participated in the putsc
h. So he™s pretty much
 isolated. Hereally 
wasn™t accepted. Plus, the conflict between Doen
itz and Goering. Hitlerin his last will and 
testament specified that Doenitz, Grand Admi ral 
Doenitz was to be -- to take his place and 
become the president or whatever, of the Reich, 
of the fourth Reich. But as far as Goering was 
concerned, he was designated to be Hitler™s su
ccessor, and it was only 
because Bormann either 
mi sinterpreted or withheld Goering™s last me ssa
ge  to Hitler fro m the 
[indecipherable] Salzburg 
to Berlin, which resulted in 
Hitler condemning Goering and s
upposedly sentencing him to death, 
to be assassinated by the -- by --  executed by the SS. That really wasn™t  Hitler™s doing, that was 

Bor mann, who intercepted the letters and acted no
t on Hitler™s behalf, but on his own behalf. So 
as far as Goering was concerned, he was still th
e president of the class.
 And this group photo I 
have, who sits in the mi ddle? The president of th
e class. Who is the successor, Doenitz? He™s in 
the back row. Well, those two f
ought each ot her all the time, never 
face to face, but to us they 
say, well Goering did this wrong, he did that 
wrong, and he™s a nobody and then of course, 
Doenitz didn™t do this and didn™t do that ri
ght. So that contest was going on all the time, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
84 
 
competing for each ot her for the crown under those circumstances, which was amusi ng. Now 
Goering personally then, to be with him was -- wa
s -- the nice part was, when you left Goering, 
if you got bored with his pomposity and his brag
gadocio, you could just say, well Herr Goering, 
I -- I have to leave now, I have
 another appointment. And as fa
r as he was concerned, that™s 
okay, I let you go now, I™m giving you permission to
 leave. He was always condescending. He 
never -- he never acted like he was a prisoner in 
-- he was alwa ys in charge. When you went to 
interrogate him, you were visiti
ng him. It wasn™t in
terrogation. Or when he came to your room 
for an interrogation. Some ti me s an interrogation 
was done out in the gar -- on the garden. We ™d 
go for a walk together in the hotel gardens and talk. But it was always, I™m free to talk to you 

now, you can come  and see me . Or I™ll give you anappointme nt at one o™clock this afternoon for 

a visit to your room. So he dismissed you and 
welcomed you always as the Reichsma rshall on 
[indecipherable]. Secondly, you -- you had to take that
 with a grain of salt and that™s part of the 
game . Secondly, he had a terrific sense of hu
mor, he really did. And he enjoyed himself 
tremendously, h-his own jokes. He could laugh 
harder at his own jokes than anybody I knew. 
And I think I me ntioned in my book t hat he had a 
collection of jokes being told about him in the 
underground, which he collected, he had written up 
in a little ba -- joke  book. And occasionally, 
if he was in the mood, he would produce his lit
tle book and that remi nded him of a story, and he 
would tell you a joke out of his -- his little 
book. Some times off-color jokes, but always with 
himself as the butt of the joke. If you were caught
 telling a joke like that
 in Germany, t hat was 
good for six months in a concentration camp. But he 
collected the joke and 
-- and save it. He was 
able to laugh at hims elf, which 
is a strange thing to say about 
a ma n who took himself very, very 
seriously, and who spent every li
ving mome nt ma king sure that you 
knew that he was really the 
leading Nazi and he was really in charge. And he 
did this and did that, an
d he was one of the few 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
85 
 
who admitted building this and building that, a
nd this was really his re sponsibility. He 
accomplished that; I, Herman Goering. Yet, he co
uld tell jokes about himself if he was in the 
mood. He had to be in the mood; he  was a very 
moody person. Part of which was due to the fact 
he™s a drug addict. He took paraco
deine tablets -- well, the numb
ers differ. Some  writers say a 
hundred tablets a day. I would say 
that was a little bit much. But he -- he chewed them like 
M&M™s. And he had a pocket full. He  actually ar
rived with -- with a box. 
I think he confiscated 
all the paracodeine in Germany befor e  he was take
n prisoner. And these were
 tablets that he just 
chewed. One individual tablet proba
bly very weak, but four or five would have the effect of a 
Valium, and he would take a handful and just chew
 on them, and then ma ybe a half an hour later, 
take another handful. And we guessed that he co
nsumed -- by Dr. Flicker, who was the German 
doctor, and we had an American doctor as well
, estimated that he was taking between 60 and 80 
a day of -- of these little par
acodeine tablets, about the size of
 M&Ms. They broke him of the 
habit, with his cooperation, by reducing the dosage. 
At first he didn™t realize they were doing it, 
and then gradually he participated, and then will
ingly, and almost proudly, to the extent that he 
lost weight, he lost 80 pounds while in prison, 
and actually began to f
eel pretty good. As he 
would say, prison life was good for my health, an
d -- because he lost weight and said that 
physically he felt better after six months in Mon
dorf and Nuremberg than he had ever in his adult 
life, ever since the time of the 
putsch when he became morphine 
addicted, so -- but all the time 
that he was in the Reich, he was, of course, wa
s a morphine addict, and we nt into the tank from 
time to time to be dried out and to take the cure
. And this paracodeine wa
s a way of -- of setting 
that. And when they broke him of the habit, he 
really -- by the time the tr
ials began, he was in 
pretty good shape, comp ared to the flab that he was when he first was taken prisoner. Now, other 
times, if he was in a bad mood, we just stayed 
away from hi m because he  wouldn™t cooperate, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
86 
 
wouldn™t talk. He would just say, 
ﬁI don™t feel like talk -- talki
ng today, and -- I™m not interested, 
I don™t want to talk to you today.ﬂ And that wa
s it, nothing you could do a
bout it. He was afraid 
of thunder and lightning. 
Q: Yes, I read that. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: He was -- 

A: Yeah that, I think Hasenclever or some body else
, another author has me ntioned that. But I -- I 
actually went in his cell one time during a thunde
rstorm, and he was hiding under the -- under 
the cot. Literally shrunk under the cot, because 
of the -- the terrific t
hunder storm and lightning, 
and he was frightened. And this was early in Mo
ndorf. And I think part 
of that was the -- the 
drug me ntality. I wa -- being generous in saying th
at, I -- he was not a cowa
rd, cause he was an -- 
an ace in World War 
1
, so it wasn™t on that basis. It had to 
be part of his me ntal outlook, or -- or 
his me ntal condition at -- 
at that particular time . 
Q: Unless -- I -- I was just -- 
I wondered as I was reading it in
 your book and I read it some where 
else, that unless the sounds remi nded him of so
mething during a -- the war, or -- World Wa r 
1
 
and that it wa sn™t thunderstorms 
so much, but some thing else. 
A: That could be it too, yeah, I™m not -- I don™t
 -- no, that wa -- I 
didn™t me ntion that -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- but that -- that™s a good poi
nt. That could be it, too. I-It 
-- but it definitely was a -- 
Q: It was so extreme [indecipherable] so extreme -- 

A: -- was sa -- it was an extreme, y
eah, for a ma n, it was kind of humorous . 
Q: Like an animal, a dog, or a cat -- 

A: And like -- yea
h, it just -- cowed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
87 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Li-Literally cowed by it, yeah. One amusing anecdote, which is part of my
 pattern of circles, I 
-- I tell in my book and is worth repeating, because
 it™s quite significant. 
As I said, Goering was 
pretty much isolated by the others
, with the result that most fr e
quently he would eat by hims elf, 
some ti me s by choice because all the -- all the othe
r guys were eating there, 
but here is where the 
Reichsma rshall eats. When he did eat with 
some body else, it would usually be because he 
wanted to discuss some  important ma tter thatcame to mi nd. Then he would actually make an 

appointme nt for lunch with -- or -- or dinner wi
th -- with the people. We ll, we took turns, the 
duty officer on occasion, like the me al time s.
 And I happened to be duty officer, you know, 
during a dinner -- lunch time, once. And as I 
said, we had ordinary German prisoners who 
delivered -- who prepared the food and -- and serv
e it. And this German -- ex-Germa n corporal, I 
think he was, who was a regular prisoner of war,
 worked in the kitchen, served -- came  in. And I 
happened to be standing near Go
ering™s table when he sat down
 and this ma n brought plate of 
stew, set it before Goering on a heavy porcelain dish, no knives or forks permitted, they -- they 

ate with spoo -- they ate with 
the spoons and all the food that was prepared was spoonable. They 
didn™t need a knife to cut their 
food, there were stews and things 
of that nature. 1600 calories a 
day, no mor e . That was prescribed by the Geneva
 Convention. This ma n se
t the plate of stew 
before Goering and Goering looked at it and smelle
d it, then he pushed it aside. And then he 
growled at this PW, he s a id, ﬁTake that slop 
away. I fed my dog much 
better than that back 
home .ﬂ And this PW took the plate of stew, a
nd stepped back and he 
clicked his heels and 
bowed, and he said, ﬁIn that case, Herr Reic
hsma rshall, your dog ate much better than we 
German sol diers di d.ﬂ Made an about face and walked out. Well, that was quite a me morable 

occasion. Forty years later, I™m the ambassador in
 Luxembourg and the city of Mondorf decided 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
88 
 
to ma ke me  an honorary citizen of Mondorf, which 
is quite an honor over there, because the -- I 
don™t know what -- what you get for it. I think yo
u don™t get arrested if 
you speed, or you can 
park any place you want to. Whatever, I™ve never ta
ken advantage of it, but they have a street 
name d for me, which -- which is great, I think th
at™s a real thrill because every day somebody is 
me ntioning my na me . They™ve got to -- you know, if
 they™re arrested, or 
have groceries shipped 
to them, or apply for a driver™s license, where do 
you live?  They™ve got to name  me  and so that™s 
a -- that™s an everlasti
ng honor that™s going to be 
there as long as the stre
et is. But I became  an 
honorary citizen, they had a big ceremony, the ma
yor, and the town council and the boy scouts 
and girl scouts and the villag
e band, everybody was out. And Wi nnieand I arrived in the embas -
- embassy car with the American flag, embassy fl
ag. One of those nice ego trips, of which we 
had ma ny. And we stepped out and they played th
e national anthems of bot
h countries and -- and 
then the ma yor, with his red, white and blue
 sash, his symbol of rank. And we had a 
[indecipherable] there. And then we me t some  -- 
met some of the other 
guests, including a ma n 
who was very Germanic in his approach, you know, the stiff legged, head bowing. And he 
introduced hims elf as Rudolf Dieb
enbush from Koblenz, and he was a special guest because he 
had asked to be invited to this occasion because
 he had read in the pa
per that the American 
ambassador was a for mer interrogator and was 
being honored in Mondorf as an honorary citizen. 
And since he had been a PW at the installation at 
that particular time, he was sure that he knew 
the ambassador, although Dolibois di dn™t mean anyt
hing to him, he knew me  as Gillen. So then 

he came -- then when he saw my fac e , he began to
 put two and two together
 and says, that -- that 
-- that  was Li eutena nt Gillen, Oberloitma n Gillen. So he was pleased to me et me  and -- and 

ma de a big show of who he was and so forth. We ll,
 I was pleased to meet him too, and we started 
to make -- compare some notes. Then he ta
pped me  on the shoulder, and he said, ﬁMr. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
89 
 
Ambassador, Herr [indecipherable],ﬂ he said, ﬁ
do you reme mb er the inci
dent when a soldier 
served a plate of stew to Goering? ﬂ And sai
d, ﬁThat was me , Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz.ﬂ 
It™s the same. I didn™t recognize him because 
he™s 40 years older. But that was Rudolf 
Diebenbush from Koble nz. 
P-Pattern of circles. 
Q: And wha t  did Goering do when he did that?  Did 
he just -- he didn™t sa y -- did he say anything, 
or -- 

A: Well, it --  it is --  I --  I wa
s in the back -- back of the -- 

Q: Oh. 

A: -- so I didn™t -- couldn™t see 
his facial expression, and he -- th
ere nothing he could say, but in 
my own mi nd, that ma n would have lost his h
ead if that had happened six months earlier, you 

know.  

Q: Right. 

A: The tables had been turned. I classify
 that as one of my ironic experiences. 
Q: I -- I understand when you were talking with
 Goering about German atrocities, he would 
mention the atroci ties committed by other countries. 

A: Oh yes, very quickly, beginning with the 
atom bomb, who dropped it on Hiroshima and 

Nagasaki. And who is the -- who™s the real wa
r criminal. By comparison how ma ny did you kill, 
compared to the numbers you accuse us of killing?  That was one of his favorite lines. 

Concentration camps?  We learn about concentrati
on camps from the Russians. And of course he 
-- he didn™t bring up the -- the 
ma ssacre in Poland and he -- 
Q: [indecipherable] Polish --  

A: -- he had all of that very ca -- yeah.  

Q: -- the Polish [indecipherable]  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
90 
 
A: And he -- he had -- he had all the histor
y. He -- he knew -- and 
he could go back to 
concentration camps of long, long time  ago. Yo
u know, he never -- he was not anti-Semitic 
according to him. It all de pended who the Jew was. If he was an eastern Je w from 
Czechoslovakia or Poland, that™s different, we do
n™t want them, get them out of Ger many, get rid 
of them. Now don™t kill them. He 
di dn™t believe in killing them, but
 he believed in getting rid of 
them by hook or by crook, just get rid of them. 
Don™t tortur e them, don™t kill them. That was not 
his idea , he says. Now, if he was a German 
Jew, and had not committed any crime against the 
governme nt, he very frequently said that he prot
ected them. I n fact, there was some  good -- some  
people in his household who were Jewish. Even 
his successor, Milch, was part Jewish, and he 
succeeded hi m as commander in chief of the Luftwa
ffe, and he claime d that he was criticized for 
that because Milch is part Jew.
 But in Germany, I say who is a Jew and who isn™t a Jew. That 
was one of his bylines. So, he was an interest
ing character, no matte
r how you -- how you sliced 
it, no ma tter what mood he was in.  
Q: But at one point in -- in your
 autobiography, you said it wasn™t
 difficult to get them to talk, 
but what was really difficult was to tr
y to figure out what the truth was. 
A: What the truth was, yes. And -- and what wa
s deliberate gossip. They were -- they were just 
gossiping, or  -- or  were they really telling the trut
h. The challenge in that was for us to try to 
learn as much -- what -- I can only speak for 
myself, to lear n as much about the German 
general™s staff be fore I interro
gated some body about the staff, so
 that I could tell when -- you 
know, when he was pulling my leg, or when he 
was just stretching a 
point. Which meant doing 
home work before you even begin an interrogation. 
And that was difficult because we knew very 
little. We  knew more about Freder
ick the Great and the German general™s staff back in the 18
th
 
century, but we didn™t know anything about the relationship of the 
German general™s staff to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
91 
 
rise of Hitler, the role that they played in his 
comi ng to power, or the role
 that they played in 
execution and planning of the war. And this is wh
at we needed to learn, we -- that™s what our 
homework is all about. And that 
is where this ma n Warlimont prove
d very valuable to me . It got 
to the point where if I had a sp-speci fi c interr
ogation report about the gene
ral™s staff to ask of 
Doenitz, for instance -- Jodl -- I 
never interrogated Jodl cause he
 was very uncooperative, yes or 
no. Everything was yes or no. And -- and he -- he 
just -- you never got much out of him. I don™t 
know who -- I don™t know of anybody of the other inte
rrogators ever got anyt
hing out of hi m. He 
was a very strict soldier, name , 
rank and serial number, and he played that for all he wa s worth. 
And as far as he was concerned, 
the prisoner of war and you didn™t ha
ve a right to try him. So, if 
I would interrogate Kesselring, or Blaskowitz, or 
one of those guys, I go to Warlimont first and 
ask him the same  questions, by way of doing home work. And then doing the interrogation and 
verifying what Warlimont had given me in rela
tionship to the answers to the questions I was 
getting from the prisoner. 
Q: So what has hap -- obviously before the Nure
mberg trial, there must be a huge number of 
people looking over all the confis
cated papers, the documents. Now, is Jackson and some  of the 
people working for him comi ng down to Mondorf and talking with you folks? 
A: No. 

Q: No, so you don™t -- you™re not getting that -- 

A: That didn™t -- 

Q: -- that information. 

A: -- we didn™t --  we didn™t --  they separated legal staff and the military intelligence staff 

completely. We were -- it is just like a privat
e investigator working on a crime, and giving his 
information to the pr osecutor. But the -- the invest
igator then doesn™t become  part of the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
92 
 
process. And that™s pretty much the role we pl
ay. We were investigati
ng the character and -- and 
the people and the incidents and verifying. A 
lot of our stuff was, do you recognize this 
document, do you know what it means?  Is that your
 signature, or is that 
Goering™s signature as 
you know it?  That™s -- that type of thing. Th
en after we got to Nurember g -- I did no 
interrogating at Nuremb erg. At -- 
at Nuremberg I was strictly -- first sent  ther e to get the 
information that Ley had, who claimed that he 
had some  i mportant information that he would 
give only to me -- in a letter 
he se nt to Lieutenant Gillen. So I was sent to Nuremberg on -- on 
temporary assignment for six days to -- to get that
 from Ley. And after th
at I was to come back 
home . But meanwhile, unbeknownst to me , Colone
l Andrews pulled strings to keep me  in 
Nuremberg because I guess -- well, because it wa
s comfortable to have -- have me  around, cause 
I brought back his days of power in -- in Luxe
mbourg. In Nuremberg Andrews didn™t have much 
clout because Jackson wa s in charge. And excep
t for guarding the pris
on, Andrews really had 
nothing to do with the prisoners. For that ma tter,
 I don™t think he ever -- 
he -- he didn™t see the 
prisoners day by day, face -- eyeba
ll to eyeball like he did in Luxembour g. And he missed that, 
and he -- he really was a figurehead in -- in Nure
mberg. So he wanted his old team back, so he 
tried to keep me there. And that was -- but he 
had to find something for me to do. So I became  
special assistant to -- to him, to
 carry out his orders. We ll, he 
had no orders, he really had none, 

except let him know -- if you talk to these guys, 
let me  know if they™re 
committing suici -- tryi ng 
to commit suicide, or if they™re doing some
thing unusual. Like one guy who was -- who had 
been Himml e r™s chauffeur, who listened to th
e radio all the time , 
putting his ear to the 
[indecipherable] dial, I mean that
 kind of stuff, a nd Andrews liked
 hi m, then it -- so then, in 
order to have some thing to do -- meanwhile, I wa
s pulling strings to get out of Nure mberg. I was 
fed up with the whole operation, I didn™t want any mo
re of it. And Andrews is trying to keep me , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
93 
 
and we finally ma de a deal. If I got some body to succeed me , then I coul d go, and then he would 
stop trying to hold onto me ; cause he needed me . And 
that is when we got Gustav Gilbert. I went 
through the Richie crowd, and Gilber
t had been an interrogator, I 
think at Wi esbaden, so that 
when he came  to Nure mberg -- he was a psycho
logist professionally and he got -- he had book 
written all over him before he came, and he 
was ready to go. He had his book planned. And -- 
and so Gilbert began to take over this visiting e
ach prisoner in his cell. 
And up to that point, the 
Rorschach analysis test came  into play in th
at -- Major Douglas, Dougl
as Kelly was the prison 
psychiatrist. He was a professiona
l psychiatrist, whose job it was 
to test these prisoners, you get 
their IQ, their personality quirks, their state of 
mi nd. Anything else that th
e inkblot test reveals. 
A lot of these people were self-appointed. Back in 
those days, really, for t
hose first six months or 
so after the war, you could pretty much do wh
at you wanted to do, and write your own orders 
cause everyb -- everybody™s in turmoil. And if
 you could just get some body to say, okay, I™m 
appointing Lieutenant Doli
bois chairman of the zoo, and I™d be
 chairma n of the zoo. So this guy 
Gilbert arrived -- Douglas arrive
s on the scene, and he™s a pr
ison psychiatrist, a-and he™s 
primarily working for so me institute, I think it wa
s the Drexel Institute, to test these prisoners. 

But the information would also be useful to 
the tribunal because it w
ould help them understand. 
So he became very important, pr ison psychiat -- 
except he coul dn™t speak German. So then they 
found out that I had ma jored in psychology in college
, so I knew -- I knew th
at -- the terms, with 
the result I became the interpreter for the Rorschac
h analys -- which I love
d, it was a lot of fun. 
Q: Why?  

A: And -- I just -- he gave the questions and I in
terpret -- transl ated and 
gave the answers. And -- 
and then he would ask me to writ
e what I thought after an
 interroga -- after 
an -- an interview, 
what™d you think of this? And then I would write 
my layman™ s report of what I think the prisoner 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
94 
 
was like. And then he combined that with his tech
nological -- his -- his scie
ntific analysis, and it 
made for a pretty intelligent report. The layman 
could read his report, wh
ereas if it had been all 
scientific, probably nothing would have -- not much 
would have come  of - -  and this is my first 
meeting with Hess, I had not interrogated Hess be fore, because he was in England. So was my -- 
my meeting with Hess is strictly 
for the Rorschach analysis test. 
And that was interesting, and of 
course on Goering and -- and Rosenberg. And that
 opened up a whole new avenue of getting to 
know them from -- from that side, see? 

Q: What did you learn that was di
fferent from doi ng these Rorschach
 tests than what you already 
knew, do you think? 

A: We ll, our interrogation befo
re was based on the questionnaires. We  were me rely getting 
answers to what we were asked to get informa -- then, mi ne was supplemented by -- by me , 

when my -- my inquiring about their welfare, 
and how ma ny children yo
u have, and how is your 
wife, and where is your wife now, a nd where 
did you live. What did you do before you became 
this. That kind of gossip information.  

Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: And then the personality --
 as I said, the gossip, who wa
s sleeping with whom. Who was 
having an affair with whose wife. Bormann™s th
igh bones were actually abnorma lly short, did 
you know that? 

Q: No. 

A: We ll, see now Buch told me  that, I would ne
ver have known, that Bormann seldom appeared 
in public and seldom appeared in movies because he
 really was a little bit 
abnormal in his shorter 
thigh bone. And Bor ma nn also was qu
ite an adulterer. And Bor mann 
had also ma de his wife into 
such a Nazi that she became estranged from her 
father and didn™t speak to her father for decades. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
95 
 
Had absolutely nothing more to do with her fa
ther; that was Walter Buch. And -- thanks to 
Bor mann. But that kind of gossip. But that had nothi
ng to do with the trial, that me rely gave us a 
picture. Now the Rorschach test then, gave us a 
complete characteri zation of the prisoners. First 
of all, the IQ. The highest IQ was Hjalma r Sc
hacht, who was close to genius. Second highest 
Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Third highest was Herman
 Goering. He was a very intelligent ma n. And 
then it went down on the line, a
ll the way to the lowest IQ, was 
Julius Streicher with 106. And so 
that -- that -- that was an interesting st atistic. 
Racial attitudes, Rosenber
g, for instance, who was a 
-- a latvi -- you know, born in the 
Balkans -- in -- in Baltics. 
Q: Baltics [i ndecipherabl e] 
A: You™re not -- he was not a German. Hess was born in Egypt, and never came  to Germany til 

he was 15 years of old -- of age. Hitler, to Hess,
 was a father image. Hess, we learned -- this is 

the Rorschach test now, nobody told us these 
things, Hess was a man who was comple tely 
dependent on some body else, he was not a ma n of
 his own, not a leader certainly, a follower. 
Always a good second in command, as long as some body 
else told him what to do, he -- he was -
- he was effective as a flunkie. Keitel was in th
e same  kind of a personalit
y. No leader, but -- but 
a -- a -- a good follower. Hess was a flake, physically. 
He had every ail -- ailment. If he read an 
article about some  disease, he 
ended up having it. He saw every 
doctor, every quack in Germany 
about all the different ailments he had. He took mo
re pills, more me dicine
s during his life -- he™s 
a vegetarian. When he was invited to dinner wi
th Hitler he brought hi
s own food, until Hitler 
finally forbade it, and wouldn™t allow it any more
 because He ss, when I invite you to dinner, you 
eat the food I -- Hitler was a vegeta
rian too, but Hess was more of a 
vege tarian than Hitler, so he 
brought his own meal, his own food to a dinner at 
Hitler™s home . Well, th
at kind of infor mation 
all revealed itself in the course of the Rorschach 
test. Hess saw things in -- in the inkblots that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
96 
 
other people never saw. He -- he saw blood wher
e some body else saw valentines. He -- it was all 
very fascinating. Rosenberg -- I 
had a copy of Rosenberg™s book 
out of the prison library. His 
myth [indecipherable] the myth of
 -- ﬁMyth of the Twentieth Century.ﬂ Not the mythos, mythis. I 
wanted him to autograph it for me , and I asked him 
to autograph it for me, and I -- this is one of 
those me mo ries -- me mo rable mo me nts that stic
k out. And he grabbed the book and actually put 
it behind his back, and says, ﬁI ca
n™t let you have this.ﬂ We ll, this
 is very amusing, and I said, 
ﬁ Why not? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁ Well, because when I 
wrote this book, I was looking for a new faith, a 
new belief, and I found it in writing the book. And 
I™m afraid if you read this book -- and I found 
out that you™re a good American offi cer, and 
you™re a good Christian. You™ll read my book and 
you™ll gi ve up your faith and you™ll give up your
 spirit of democracy, and you™ll accept my 
concepts of -- of the world, and I™ll have that 
on my conscience.ﬂ Which -- thinking pretty much 
of his book. But I promised that I w
ould never read it, if he would ju
st autograph it I™d have it as 
a souvenir. So he did autograph it for me . He didn
™t inscribe it, just A. Rosenberg. I me ntioned 
this to Hess. I asked Hess if he had ever
 written a book. ﬁNo, why do you ask? ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁ Well, because I™m collecting books with autogr
aphs and I thought if you had one, I would look 
for it, and get your autograph.ﬂ And I told him 
about Rosenberg. And his -- Hess said -- oh, I™m 
sorry, not he -- not Hess, Schacht -- Schirach, 
the you -- the youth 
leader, said that Rosenberg™s 
book is the only bestseller that nobody has ever 
read, because it™s a mi sh mosh of anti-
Catholicism,  anti-Christianity, anti-Semitism, 
ant i  everyt hing that™s decent [indecipherable] 
respect. So that was von Schirach™s answer to th
at particular incident. 
He had never wr itten a 
book either, Schirach. 

Q: Let me  a sk you some thing, where did you -- wha 
-- why did you get this idea of asking people 
for autographs, did you have a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
97 
 
A: Yeah, th-tha -- there was a reason -- there 
was a reason for that. I came through Rass on the 
day Jodl signed a surrender document, and -- su
rrendering unconditionally, and his signature was 
strictly Jodl, J-o-d-l. And then under that, Gene
raloberst. That was all. But some one who was 
there, an at -- an hist orian, Co
lonel Hale, Univer sity of Virginia, mentioned this to me, and I 
thought, gee that™s -- you know, I could have sto
pped in Rass and I could have seen Jodl. 
Imagine -- I would have liked to have a -- s
ee what the guy looked like. This is before 
Luxembour g, so I didn™t know I was going to end 
up in Luxembourg and actually live in the 
same  building with Jodl for -- for months. So when Jodl showed up in Luxembourg and 

everything, I thought, well here™s -- 
I -- I™ll get his autograph. So I 
went to Jodl with a three by 
five card, and I asked him if he would sign this
 for me , like he signed the surrender. And her 
accommodat e d me , Jodl, Generaloberst. Then it o
ccurred to me that I -- I had Jodl™s, and I 
should have Keitel™s, who signed 
the surrender on the eas
tern front, then I would have two. And 
I had visions I™d frame it, have 
-- these are the signatures that 
appeared on the surrender that 
ended the wa r. So I got Keitel™s. We ll, apparently 
Keitel or Jodl told some of the other prisoners 
that I had asked them for  an autograph. I don™t kn
ow why -- because when we were getting ready 
to move them from Luxembourg to Nuremberg, five 
or six of them ca me  to me  and said they™d 
like to give me  their autograph. Doenitz was one 
of them. So they gave me  their autograph on a 
piece of pape r, and so forth. So I became  known 
as an autograph collector , and I really didn™t 
have that in mi nd at all. When I was sent 
[indecipherable] my comma
nding officer was Colonel 
Phelp, and on the occasion one time was having lunch with Colonel Phelp, and I told him about 

this. I said, ﬁWould you want to see the name s 
of the -- the guys w
ho signed the surrender 
document? ﬂ And I showed them to Colonel Phelp. 
He says, ﬁHey,ﬂ he said, ﬁthat gives me  an 
idea.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhy don™t you get me  the si
gnatures of all those guys when you go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
98 
 
Nuremberg, next time  you go to Nuremberg?  Get 
all their signatures a
nd their photographs.ﬂ 
And he said, ﬁI™ll ma ke up a scrapbook, I™m goi
ng to give it to Eisenhower.ﬂ A scrapbook, a 
picture of each one of the hi
gh ranking Nazis and their autogr
aphs. And I said okay, and that 
gave me  an idea, I thought, well 
in that case, I™ll ge
t two autographs, I™ll keep one for myself, 
and I™ll have a complete collection. So that was 
my idea. So that was my -- when I went to 
Nuremberg then to get -- to -- to
 talk to Ley about his ma ster 
plan for the reconstruction of 
Germany, I had autographs in mi
nd. And I willingly got them, at l
east half a dozen others, but 
some  refuse d to sign. Hess, for instance, refuse
d to sign his. So I ma de up a certificate, 
mi me ographed, [speaks German here]. I certify herewith
 that  this is my offi
cial signature. Then I 
went to them, I said, you know, in relation to docume
nts in a trial, we want to have your official 
signature on record. And I got 
their autographs, two copies; on
e for me  and one for the -- the 
scrapbook for General Eisenhower. The sequel to that
 is that I had this collection, my own. I 
didn™t have any photographs, we we
ren™t allowed to take pictur
es. But I me t a Navy officer, a 
Navy officer in Nurembe r g, American, and -- in the 
Panther Pit, that™s the bar at the Grand Hotel 
where a lot of us were billete
d. And we happened to 
sit at the bar togeth
er and I said, you know, 
what™s the Na vy doing in Nuremberg?  You know, th
ere are no Navy ships here, and -- and he 
said well he™d been -- he was naval intellig
ence, and he was assigne
d to -- in the photo -- 
business of photo intelligence, identification of 
docume nts and so forth. And he said, you know, 
funny thing, Hitler™s official photographer was just
 brought in a couple of days ago, and he had a 
whole suitcase full of pictures 
of all the -- the high ranking Nazi
s and where they lived and all 
that kind of stuff. So here was my boy, and I to
ld him that I was trying to get some  photographs, 
could he -- he get me  some  copies. So hevery obligingly ma de copies of some  of the 

photographs of all of the -- the Nazis that were
 in -- in Hoffman, the photographer™s collection. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
99 
 
He gave them to me . I mean, we met a few da
ys later, I got copy. So I had photographs and -- 
and autographs and I gave a set to Colonel Phelp.
 There™s a sequel to that
, very recent one. I told 
you earlier, I was not a souvenir co
llector, and there was a time  a 
few ye ars ago when -- when it 
was just -- at least in my part of the world, 
where having Nazi souvenirs
 sort of ma de  you stand 
out if you showed them t o anybody, as a Nazi sy
mpathizer. And I™m thinking of Marge Schott, 
who was even me ntioned in the newspapers beca
use she had a swastika armband -- in a negative 
way. None of my grandchildren we
re interested in any of this
 stuff, so I found some body who 
was interested, who said that he would give 
these to a museum connected with the Simon 
Wi esenthal Center in California. And I gave them
 to him, the autographs and the pictures. Gave 
them to hi m.  A month ago I got a book in th
e ma il, by a ma n name d John K. Latimer, M.D., 
doctor, who was a doctor at Nuremberg, off and o
n. One of these guys who could -- I want to go 
see what it™s like at Nuremberg, so he went ther
e, and he went to Nuremberg. And actually, as a 
doctor, could interview some  
of the prisoners, which he di
d. And just a month ago, his book 
came out, and the title of the 
book is, ﬁHitler™s Fatal Disease, and Other Anecdotes.ﬂ  He knew 
me, because I had interpreted for him a couple of
 times. So it™s inscribe
d to -- he read my book, 
inscribed to Ambassador Dolibois and in parenthe
ses, our Lieutenant Gillen from Nur e mberg. 
And he wrote this book, it just came out a mont
h ago, and he sent me  a complimentary copy, 
cause he had read my book, and remi nded me , in a le
tter that I sent to hi
m thanking him, I said, 
ﬁHow did you get my name ? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁAbout
 five years ago I wrote to you about your book 
and you sent me a compl i mentary copy and I™m re
turning the favor.ﬂ A
nd I™d completely -- I 
don™t reme mber it at all. I had sent him a copy 
of my book with my autograph, because we me t 
as a -- a -- a fellow -- a colleague
 or some thing, a fellow Nuremberger, cause I had interpreted 
for him. Now his book comes out, on ﬁHitler™s Fata
l Disease,ﬂ explaining why Hitler did the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
100 
 
things he did and also some  st
ories about some  of the others. 
Some  of the stories based on my 
book. And he credits me , he -- he does say, according to Lieutenant Dolibois, or Lieutenant 
Gillen at  that  point, so and so said what. And then accompanying each one of these articles was 

their photograph and their autogra
ph. So I wrote to him, and I said where did you get those 
pictures, because some  of the ata -- autogra
ph have my own handwriting on them, where I write 
the -- the titles in, like genera
le fieldmarshall Keitel. And he said he bought them from a 
collector, he didn™t reme mber his name , but he
 paid a pretty good price for them. So my 
photograph collection, and autograp
hs are in the possession of Dr. John K. Latimer, who is a 
me dical doctor and has written a book about Hitler
™s fatal disease. Do you know wha t  the fatal 
disease is? 

Q: Tell me. Tell me. 

A: Parkinson™s disease. Hitler had Parkinson™ s di sease, and this man analyzes this based on what 

other doctors who had interviewed Hitler, or people whom he interviewed who knew Hitler, and 
a series of photographs in the book, which is a fe
ature. Toward the end of his years, every 
photograph you see of Hitler, he is ei
ther clasping his belt with hi
s left hand, or has his left hand 
in his pocket, or is -- is holding an umbrella or
 a staff or cane or some th
ing in his left hand, to 
prevent his showing the -- the Parkinson™s 
disease symptoms. And this Dr. Latimer has 
concluded on the basis -- on the interviews, a
nd his me dical observation 
and other tests, that 
Hitler suffered fr om Parkinson™s di sease and ma
ny of the decisions that  Hitler made, like the 
invasion of the Soviet Union, were due to the fact
 that he knew he didn™t much time left before 
his disease would be publicly known and he woul
d lose his effectiveness with the Ge rman 
people, and he would no longer be able to fulf
ill all of his dreams. So he ma de ma ny fatal 
decisions based on the knowledge that he -- that 
he had a fatal disease of which he was going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
101 
 
die. And that™s the title of this book, just cam
e out a month ago. ﬁHitler™s Fatal Disease, and 
Other Anecdotes,ﬂ or stories about other 
Nazis. And my pictures are in there. 
Q: But how did he get these 
photographs if you donated the -- 
A: He bought them from a collector. And the -- 

Q: But you donated them to the ba -- the Wi esenthal Center. 

A: I gave them to an individual who was going to give them to the Wi esenthal Center. 

Q: I see, right, so he lied to you. 

A: I sold my  epaulets to that same  individual, 
and for that I got paid, 
but he didn™t say anything 
that he didn™t -- he didn™t say anything about 
selling the photographs. All he said was I™m going 
to give these to the museum at th
e Wiesenthal Center. And he had -- 
Q: And the epaulet was from Goering? 

A: The epaulets were Goering™s epaulet -- 

Q: Goering™s, right. 
A: -- which Goering gave to me .  
Q: Right. Okay. 

A: But that™s what happened to autographs. 

Q: Okay, let™s stop this tape.

Q: Okay. I™m going to ask you a bunch of questi
ons that are not necessarily in or der -- 
A: Fine. 

Q: -- since you™ve been so 
good chronologically, but I thought 
I would like to get some 
impressions from you. You told the story about a woma n spy in your book, a woma n name d Gail 

Wi chell? 

A: Vitchell, mm-hm. 

Q: Vitchell. And how she got -- 

A: Yup. 

Q: -- sa -- it™s very -- it™s sort of funny in a 
[indecipherable] a little bit.
 She™s the only woma n -- 
A: Yup, yup. 

Q: -- in the story, so I thought ma ybe it w
ould be interesting fo
r you to retell that.  
A: Yeah, that -- there was several other wome n in 
the story, but very -- very briefly, one of them 
being Jodl™s wife -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and -- that I -- that I me
ntioned, and Streicher™s wife -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- Adele. But this Guyon Vitchell was -- sh
e wa s a professional spy. And she apparently had 
some  relationship, whether a love -- whether it 
was a love relationship, 
but she knew one of the 
generals that we had in a pris
on da -- now we had in Nuremberg 
-- this is in Nuremberg now, not 
in Luxembourg, we didn™t have
 any wome n in Luxembourg, but in
 Nuremberg, the top floor, one 
side of the top floor of the prison where all th
e Nazis were kept was reserved for wome n. And 
Hi mmler™s -- Himmler™s secret ar
y, and Ribbentrop™s secretary were
 among the prisoners, mostly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
103 
 
as witnesse s, not because  they were charged with
 any crimes, or intended to be. And this Vitchell 
apparently, I don™t know why she was taken prisoner
, cause there were a lot of spies, and -- and 
some  of them we even knew about. But this one, 
I think because she had th
e connection with this 
general -- and we thought that 
was the -- the spy on the higher 
rank, because the relationship -- 
and they were exchanging notes with each other. And we -- our curios ity was aroused by how -- 

how she could write a note and end up -- ends up 
in his cell. So obviously one of our guards was 
delivering me ssages from one prisoner to another. 
And that was strictly ve
rboten, that wa -- that 
was not allowed at all. So this was one of my 
functions, that -- that Co
lonel Andrews delegated 
to me when I became his special assistant. So I was to find out how this note business was going 

about. And wi -- the -- the whole in
cident was that I -- I went -- 
went to her cell, naturally. And 
the guards were not allowed in the cells at all. 
They were -- they had to stand outside the cell. 

And up at that section I think was one guard fo
r the whole corridor, we only had five or six 
wome n prisoners. But I noticed that Vitchell
, who was a rather striking looking woma n, and 
when -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe 
that came  all the way to her feet. And -- which 
I thought was unusual prison garb, but they weren™t re
ally being held as -- as criminals, so I 
didn™t pay too much attention to it. But I was 
asking her questions, and I forget how the sequel 
went, because I didn™t attach that mu ch impor
tance to it, but I did notice that she had a good 

stack of American cigare
t -- cigarettes brand -- American bra
nd cigarettes, loosely, not in a pack, 
but i-in a tray on her table in -- in the prison. An
d in the course of questioning, she -- I asked her 
where she got those cigarettes and she had no hes
itancy at all in answer
ing by just opening her 
robe. And I found out she was abs -- absolutely 
stark naked underneath the robe. Which was 
unusual prison garb also. And then 
I put two and two together and I 
said, ﬁLet me  see if I have 
this figured right. You get those 
cigarettes,ﬂ because they were 
not prison issue, ﬁyou get those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
104 
 
cigarettes from the guard. And you give him peep 
show and he tosses in 
a cigarette,ﬂ through the 
opening where we pass their food. And she said I 
had that absolutely right. We ll, I don™t know 
whether the guard was listening 
on the outside, which I think he 
was, and there really wasn™t 
anything I could do about it, and it 
really wasn™t that much of an
 issue. But obviously one of the 
guards who was willing to carry the messages wa
s giving extra cigarettes and doing her that  
favor, which -- it struck my sense of humor. I don™
t think it was a criminal
 offense, I didn™t want 
to -- but I knew if I re
ported this to Colonel Andrews, so
me body would end up in the -- in the 
brig, and some body would be severe
ly punished. So I -- I had a littl
e fun, I came  out of the cell, 
and the guard was standing in there, and just by 
looking at him, I could 
tell that he -- he knew 
what I -- what the conversation wa
s, cause he™s all red in the fa
ce, and -- and being extra polite 
and standi ng at rigid attention, almos t  like a statue
. So I just went up to hi m right face to face and 
looked at him and said, if you won™t tell, I won™t 
tell, or some thing to that effect, and walked 
away. And he said, ﬁThank you, sir.ﬂ And he clicke
d his heels. And I became  very popular with 
the guards cause the word got around very quickly. 
But I reported this to
 Colonel Andrews, who 
had no sense of humor at all. And Colonel Andr
ews would occasionally repeat the same story, 
but he had it all mi xed up. And he was giving a -- 
I think it was Ribbentrop™
s secretary or one of 
-- one of those people™s secretarie
s™ credit for being the -- the pe
rson that exposed herself. And 
that particular person was extremely ugly, and 
-- and nobody would give up a 
cigarette to look at 
her in the nude or even dressed. So that ma de 
it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause he -
- he enjoyed his story so much, but
 he did have it all screwed up. 
He had one other joke that he 
had to tell every newcomer, saying that -- he sai
d, hell, I always -- I thought -- I -- God™s last 
name was damn. When he grew
 up he thought God™s last name  was damn, and that was an 
hilarious story, when he though -- he thought that
 was just great until he found out otherwise.

But he had no sense of humor, comp ared to
 Reichsma rshall Goering, who had a pretty good 
sense of humor. 
Q: [indecipherable]. Tell me  why 
it was that you visited the wives 
-- I guess at least three, right? 
Goering™s wi fe, Kesselring, and Selta. 
Why was it that you -- that you went -- 
A: I -- I visited Kesselring and Selta™s wife when
 I went to Tegernsee with Wa rlimont to get 
those documents a -- I don™t know if you want to 
go into that story, but it
™s kind of humorous and 
interesting, too. But Wa rlimont -- mi nd you now, he
™s general of the artillery, a three star 
general, came to me  one day in Oberoszul and to
ld me  that he had a proposition, that he would 
like to visit his wife and his children, he 
had three children, two daughters and a son, at 
Tegernsee where -- where they lived on -- in Bava
ria and that if I would take him there so he 
could visit his family, he would in turn ma ke ava
ilabl e to me, all the mi nutes of all the meetings 
of the German general™s staff, bound in volumes
 all the way back to 1792 or ™32, when the 
general™s staff was founded. No
t only that but he would also have some  other books and 
documents, ma nuscripts, he™d ma ke them available to me , on the history of the Germa n general™s 

staff. We ll, that was extremely valuable, but the id
ea of my taking that prisoner to visit his family 
was just so ridiculous that I ha
d repeat it as a joke to my co
mmanding officer, I said to him, 
ﬁColonel, you -- you won™t believe this,ﬂ and -- 
and I told him. And he thought it over, and he 
smiled a little bit, and ma de no other comment. But 
the next day he called me  in and said he had 
been thinking it over, and that I ought to just 
go ahead and take Wa rlimont, but we just keep 
quiet about it. We  wouldn™t ma ke this an o-offici
al record, he would just give me  the travel 
orders, by order of the commanding officer, and 
authorize me  to go to Tegernsee, and be 
accompanied by PW W. Warlimont. But we woul
dn™t talk to anybody about it, because we -- 
obviously wa sn™t going to be allowed by anyone 
higher up. So I arranged a week later to take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
106 
 
Warlimont on a tour in a Jeep and I had my 45 ca
liber gun, and he was dressed in civilian clothes 
anyway, because he was no longer active in the 
army when he  surrendered to us. No problem, 
but I passed him off as my interpreter and my 
driver. The first problem we had was when we 
stopped in St uttgart at a military mess to get 
lunch. And the me ss sergeant of course saw my 
orders, which I presented to him, and sure e
nough sir, you can eat and 
all the courtesy and 
everything else, he said, but the Kraut isn™t 
going to get any food. And I had convinced the 
sergeant that the Kraut wa s a pretty nice guy and he
 was my i nterpreter and give him a big sales 
talk and fi nally the sergeant rele
nted and allowed the Kraut to ge
t some  food in the kitchen, but I 
heard him give a -- General Warlimont orders
 about washing his me
ss kit afterwards and 
cleaning it -- cleaning up
 after him, and he used a four 
-- a few selective phrases. I wondered 
what he would have done if he had known he wa
s talking to a three star German general, 
ordering him to wash his own me ss  kit. We ll, that story became  interesting as we got to 
Tegernsee. It seemed that Warlimont lived right 
next door to his in-laws.
 His wife™s mo ther and 
father, his ma  -- wife™s fa ther was an opera sing
er, and the wife™s mother was a native American, 
had been born in United States
, related to the Anheuser-Busch 
fa mily, a distant relative of the 
Anheuser-Busch fa mily. And he had me t their da
ughter in the United States. He wa -- the opera 
singer Baron von Cleidorf was his name , had tour 
-- was touring the United States when he me t 
this girl, whom he then ma rried in 1903, and th
ey had a daughter, and that daughter became  the 
wife of General Wa rlimont. So now Baron and Ba
roness von Cleid -- Cleidor
f lived next door to 

the Warlimonts. I st ayed with them, and the gene
ral stayed with his wife and his three children. 
They had a very happy family reunion. And we vi
sited for three days a
nd during that visit -- I 
then took off in my Jeep and went to visit Kess
elring™s wife and Selta™s wife, and brought them 
news. They had not heard of their husbands, where 
they were, if they were even alive. So I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
107 
 
really the harbinger of joy. And as
 a result of that  visit, as a 
gift to me  in the course of 
conversation, they developed an interest in my fa
mily. And I pointed out th
at I had a little son at 
home , and so I ended up with a pa
ir of lederhosen as a special gi
ft from Mrs. Selta for my son. 
And those are authentic lederhosen, they™re th
e real McCoy. So I was very proud and happy to 
have them. But it was on that occasi
on I visited those two wives. And -- 
Q: But -- go ahead. 
A: Go ahead, yeah. 

Q: No, no, go ahead. 

A: No. We ll, the -- the whole purpose of that vi
sit -- and that was fully understood -- in fact, I 
had orders. Re me mber, there wa
s a non-fraternization law, and 
American personnel were not 
permitted to fraterni ze with Germans. You could ge
t in real trouble just  by seeing -- seeing -- by 

being seen talking to a German. So
 I had a special set of orders, as
 to -- that I was a me mber of 
military intelligence, and was authorized to en
ter German homes, and also authorized to 
interrogate, investigate whatever
 mi ssion I™d -- I decided on. But 
I had official authorization. 
And this was on my -- on my orders, which I alwa
ys carried with me , be cause like an instance, 
like if anybody, military police had seen me going in
to a German home, I could have gotten in 
real trouble if I wasn™t aut
horized. Course, there was a lot 
of fraternization going on throughout 
Germany, but it was one of those rules that 
was a little bit ridiculous because in my 
[indecipherable] here was our opportunity with 
an army of occupation to really do some 
brainwashing of the Germans, and c onvince them 
that our system is far superior to the Nazi 
system. And we could have organized the German
 youth into basketball te
ams and soc cer teams 
and football teams and tell them about American 
sportsma nship. Instead, we  weren™t allowed to 
talk to them, which to me seemed a little silly. We  -- we mi ssed a wonderful opportunity, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
108 
 
was reversed when the Marshall plan went into e
ffect and we then did what we should have done 
immediately after the war. But this fraterni zati
on policy was ridiculous. One more secret to the 
story of Wa r limont is that on our way home  
-- and I did get the documents. And I don™t know 
what happened to all of the documents, but I do 
know that years later 
I purchased a book from 
my library written by John Wheeler Bennett, whic
h was the -- the mc  -- ﬁNe mesis of Power; A 
History of the German General™s Staff.ﬂ And I know
 that a lot of the research and documentation 
that appeared in John Wheeler Bennett™s book had to come  from the documents that we 

recovered through General Wa rlimont on this visit 
-- il-illegal visit to his family. On the way 
home  I didn™t travel the Autobahn, 
I took the side roads, because just
 in case of an accident or 
something, I still would have tr
ouble explaining what I was doi
ng traveling with
 a three star 
German general who was really a prisoner of war.
 So I took the side roads pretty muc h. And we 
were right near the Bavarian 
headquarters of General Patton,
 who had been appointed the 
military governor of Bavaria. And we were trave
ling along this some what isolated country road, 
heading back toward Oberoszul when there wa
s a commotion ahead of us, and obviously some  
kind of a traffic disturbance. And I pulled my Jeep
 over to side of the road and got out and stood 
by the road to see what was comi ng my way, and wh
en they reached me  with the sirens going, it 

was a Jeep with a flasher and siren, full blast, an
d then a staff car with license plate and four 
stars. And in the back seat was no less a person 
than General Patton and his dog. And of course I 
threw a fancy salute and General Patton acknowle
dged it by raising his riding crop, which he had 
in his hand, and passed on. And a fantastic thought th
at occurred to me  was that if I had only had 
enough nerve to stop the -- that pa
rticular convoy, and introduced 
General Patton to the German 
general, who had arranged all of the offensiv
e and defensive ma neuvers, including the invasion 
of Nor mandy, and say, ﬁThis is the guy who tried 
to stop you, general. A
nd this general is the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
109 
 
ma n who -- whom you c ouldn™t stop.ﬂ It would have 
been quite a meeting, but I would have had 
an awful time explaining what I 
was doing illegally with -- trave
ling with this important PW. So 
that was the whole story of that
. Visiting Mrs. Goering was part of the same  scheme , th-the 
agreement was -- and our military intelligence was 
that any way we could gather  information be 
useful, and visiting their fa milies was not only 
a gesture that opened up 
and loosened tongues, 
but it also gave us a chance to get another viewpoi
nt as I -- I mentioned ear
lier. So I went to -- 
went to visit Mrs. Goering. The housekeeper answ
ered the door and saw my American uniform 
and all but slamme d the door in my face, she would have nothing to do with me . So I went back 

and I told Goering that I tried 
to see his wife. He knew that --
 where I was going, I said I™m -- I 
was going on a trip and I was comi ng near where hi
s wife was. I think was one of the -- one of 
the chateaus that had once belonged to him, she was 
living in part of it. He then gave me  a -- a 

picture of hims elf and Emmy and 
their little daughter Edda, and 
wrote on the back of it that 
Oberloitman Gillen has my confidence and --  an
d trust, and si gned Hermann Goering, and the 
date, August eighth, I reme mber, 1945. It was A
ugust -- yeah, I think it™s August eighth. 
Anyhow, I went back there severa
l weeks later on another busine
ss trip and stopped there, and 
this time  I showed the housekeeper the photo an
d she took it into Mrs. [indecipherable] Miss 
[indecipherable] -- Mrs. Goering, and she hersel
f came to the door and invited me  in. I only 
stayed a few mi nutes, just small talk and -- and talk
ing to he r a little bit. 
I promised that I would 
come back, because I had someone el
se in the car with me  as I re
call, and I didn™t want to ma ke 
too much of a -- a visit out of it, 
other than my just delivering a le
tter, and so I promised to come  
back. And I went back again a couple of weeks late
r with a letter to the littl
e girl from her father. 
And Mrs. Goering was in prison, she™d been a
rrested by military government -- government for 

the art treasures, and she 
certainly was involved in s-some  of 
that art confisca
tion. And the little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
110 
 
girl was in a children™s home . So 
I went to vi sit her and actually 
held her on my lap and read her 
father™s letter to her, which was a kind of an
 e motional experience that I wasn™t soliciting. But 
that was the occasion of -- of th
at pa rtis -- personal visit.
 Others were -- wives visiting 
Nuremberg during the time  that I was working fo
r Colonel Andrews directly, as sort of an 
assistant prison public relations o
fficer. And when they had visitors
 like that, I know Mrs. Jodl 
came, and Streicher™s wife, and oh, two or thr
ee others that -- oh, von 
Ribbentrop™s wife, who 
incidentally is a very ugly woma n, personally 
di -- but she was a -- an heir to the Henkle 
champagne people. In this case 
-- and he was a salesman for th
e champagne line, I think it was 
Henkle [indecipherable] Henkle or one of theothers. Anyhow, he ma rried the boss™s daughter 

and this is how he -- how he got ahead. Von 
Ribbentrop, incidentally, 
I don™t know if you knew 
that he was not really a von. No, he -- h-he wa
s born Ribbentrop, but ther
e was an aunt who was 
ma rried -- his mother™s sister who was ma rri
ed to von Ribbentrop -- the other way around, 
brother, who was knighted, and he had the right
 to the title von Ribbentrop. And at age 32, von 
Ribbentrop himself, the foreign 
mi nister, Joachim, arranged for hi
s aunt, Mrs. von Ribbentrop to 
adopt him at age 32, so that he would beco
me  Joachim von Ribbentrop. Which helped him 
tremendously because it helped se
ll hi m to Hitler, who was i mpressed by the von idea, plus the 
fact that von Ribbentrop could 
speak English and -- and other th
ings. But she was another one 
who came to visit in a relationshi p with families. 

Q: I-I -- I understand that  justice Jackson came a
nd gave a semi nar [indecipherabl e] international 

military tribune -- was this in Mondorf? 

A: In Nuremberg. 

Q: In Nuremberg. 

A: No this is -- by the time th
e trials were ready to begin.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
111 
 
Q: So he gave the semi nar to whom?  
A: To the staff, the American officers who were
 assigned, both the guard element and people like 
me , a-and the prison psychiatrist and anybody else 
involved in the trial procedure. There were 
the -- the -- there was a tremendous 
judicial staff, lawyers and -- 
and others who were acting as 
the -- well, assistants to the prosecuting staff. 
The prosecuting staff had, I think -- well, Colonel 
Amon was t he deputy to Justice Jackson, Telfor
d Taylor were the only two I ever had any 
relationshi p with. I -- I interpreted for Amon on 
a few occasions, particularly the Ley episode 
where Ley was presenting his ma st
er plan, and -- and I™m -- I™m 
the one who took -- I took Ley™s 
document to Colonel Amon and then he and Jackson ruled on insignificance of it and ordered me  

to -- to tell Ley that it wasn™t
 any good. So Amon and -- and Te lford Taylor are the only two I 

had any connections with. Justice Jackson decided 
he could give a talk, a semi nar to all of the 
people connected with the prison. And the pur
pose of the semi nar 
was to explain the 
international tribunal, because ag
ain, none of us knew what we we
re really doing -- what this 
was all about, why we were having a tribunal an
d who was going to participate. The organization 
of the tribunal. The fact that we
 were having four judges and assi
stant judges from each of the 
ma jor nations participating. And the prosecuting 
staff of each of the four nations. And the 
conduct of the whole trial, and -- and what we 
were doing. And even the 
-- the redesign -- not th 
-- the rebuilding of the Palace of
 Justice, which had been heavily bombed. And we had SS me n 
who were doing the hard labor on -- who -- buildi
ng the tribunal room, which was ironic again, I 

thought, because their high ranking l
eaders were going to be tried 
in the courtroom that they 
were repairing, in the bu
ilding that they were 
reconstructing for this 
purpose. So Jackson™s 
purpose was to explain this to us, and that was 
the first detailed account I 
ever received, the only 
one for that ma tter, of what th
e purpose of the trial was, and 
what we were doing and had been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
112 
 
doing and why -- why we had been doing it. And 
I was quite impressed with Justice Jackson, I 
thought he was quite a --
 an outstanding person. 
Q: And wha t  did you think of his explanation? 
A: We ll, I had my own questions 
about it, but again, that™s from the standpoint of a then 27 year 
old, rather naïve person. Question number one was, 
we had Soviet judges sitt
ing at trial, for the 
kind of crimes that  the Soviet Union had also committed. Some how here is the ke ttle calling the 

pot black, you know. And I knew that if I were pr
eparing a defense and it were allowed, I would 
certainly raise that question in a courtroom. 
You know, you are accusing us and finding us guilty 

of crimes that one of the judges up he re represents a country which committed the same  cri mes. 

That of course, was one of the first questions. 
Next question was strictly
 out of naiveté. The 
moral position we were taking on the dropping of th
e atom bombs, for instance. While I, even to 
this day say I think we did the right thing in 
dropping it, but from thestandpoint of civilians 
being killed who really were not involved, and 
we were killing civilians too, weren™t we, with 
that bomb?  I™d say do it again if
 we had to under the same  circum
stances, but it still raised the 
question in my mi nd. It also ma de me think agai
n about the very serious 
questions that Goering 
himself, and Doenitz, and two or three other of 
the more intelligent of the high ranking personnel 
that we had in captivity raised. They said -- 
not a question, but prediction they made, the day will 
come  when you wish Germany were on yo -- were on your side and helping you against the 
Soviet Union. That was only a year before the 
Cold Wa r broke out. Their prediction was true. 

Billions that we have spent in cr eating a bulwark between western de mo cracy and Soviet 

communis m [indecipherable] Germa ny. And what we
 did in building up the -- the Marshall plan 
to begin with, in rebuilding Germany, to the po
int where I™ve asked mys e lf, who won the war?  
And that question certainly came up in this discu
ssion. So while it was very informative from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
113 
 
standpoint of the mecha nics, from the standpoin
t of the philosophy of the trials, I had to ask 
myself that question -- those que
stions. That was my -- not a re
ply to Jackson cause I wouldn™t 
dare have stood up and asked those questions, but th
ey came  to mi nd, where th -- I still maintain 
to this day that the trial was fa
ir, it was justice, I™m proud to have
 been a part of it, and my only 
concern now is as -- as I™m approach old age, is
 the imitation of the Nuremberg trials that™s 
going on around the world. And I think they take aw
ay from what the Nuremberg trials really 
tried to accomplish; that is to ma
ke it illegal to invade another 
country and enslave its people. To 
ma ke cri mes against the peace, viol ation of tr
eaties and non-aggression pa cts an international 
crime. To punish those who -- who practice cr
imes against huma nity. Thou shalt not kill. 
Nothing original about that, that goes back thous
ands of years, thou shalt not kill. And people 
who do kill, whether they do it on behalf of 
their governme nt or not, should be tried and 
punished. And thirdly, if you have an agreementon how to conduct a war, war crime s, define 

what the rules are, and if you br
eak those rules, you™re guilty of
 war crime s. Don™t mi x apples 
and oranges. Don™t mi x crimes against humanitywith war crimes or crimes against the peace. 

And these imitation international tribunals going on 
now in certain places, 
are -- th-they™re not 
real, they™re imitations. They™re 
not the real thing. They don™t ha
ve the same  objective, they 
don™t have the same  basis for operation, or for be
ing. And we™re -- we™re opening doors there we 
mi ght be sorry about some day. And -- 

Q: Why do you call them i mita -- in wh
at sense are they im -- imitate -- 
A: The ha -- well, The Ha
gue, the international -- 

Q: No, I understand what -- to what you™re referring, but why are you calling them an im -- 

imitation, and clearly you think th
ey™re a pale imitation, so why? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
114 
 
A: We ll, bec -- because they are taking an i
ndividual Serb, who is responsible for 12 wome n 
being raped, and they™r e saying he committed th
e war crime. But there™ s never been a war 
declared. There -- there™s never been -- the war cr
imes don™t apply in that 
particular case. It™s a 
crime against humanity. It™s a violation of -- of a 
-- a law. Rape is immoral, it™s illegal , it™s 
wrong. That ma n should be punished for rape. He 
shouldn™t be punished for a war crime. That -- 
Q: Are you saying that in Bosnia there was no war?  There was a war. 
A: Yeah, there w -- there was a war, but who estab
lished it to be a war?  Th
e Croats we re fighting 
with the Germans against the Serbs, 
who were on our side in World Wa r 
11
, right?  I mean, the 
Serbs were on the Amer ican side. The Croats
 and the Muslims were on the German side. 
Q: Well, the mu -- 

A: Yeah. And they committed crimes against the Se
rbs, crimes against hu manity. I mean, they -- 
they did the Nazi™s bidding in Yugoslavia, 
and they committed crimes that were quite 
horrendous. Now the tables are turned, Tito is
 gone and Milosevic come s into power. Now 
Milosevi c is committing the same crimes that th
e s -- that the Croats and the Muslims committed 
against him.  Now which one of them is the war 
cr iminal? They both committed the same crimes.  
Q: But you -- you™re -- you™re talk
ing about two different time peri
ods. You can™t only say that 
World War 
11
 is the only time that war crimes or cr imes against humanity have been committed.  
A: No, I -- I maintain that 
an international tribunal -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- ought to be an international court -- it ought
 to be established the same  way the Nuremberg 

trials were established. I don™t 
think that any nation can sudden
ly say we™re going to have an 
international trial and -- and se
t it up -- it won™t work -- it -- 
Q: Do you think there should be a 
permanent international tribunal? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
115 
 
A: No, I don™t think so. 
Q: You don™t. 

A: I -- I really -- because it -- it can get out of
 hand, like The Ha gue is 
going to get 
out of hand. 
You know who is going to be tried next?  The 
United States. For war crimes. You know -- you 
reme mber the North Korean -- the South Koreans,
 300 of them, civilians who were ma s sacred by 
American troops, who were told that North Ko
reans are invading and were under the impression 
that under that bridge were No
rth Koreans who were pretending to be South Koreans, and so 
they killed them. And there are -- now people ar
e saying that was a war crime. The Americans 
killed those innocent civilians. 
When we invaded Panama  to capture Noriega, some  civilians 
were killed. We hadn™t declared 
war on Panama . We just invaded 
Panama  to catch Noriega. And 
we killed some civilians. There are now Panama ni
ans who want rest itution, and they want the 
United States to be tried for war crimes, because  
we invaded their country and killed civilians. 
Q: But you certainly wouldn™t ma intain that en -- 
if there is such a thing as a war crime --  
A: It should be punished -- 

Q: It should be punished -- 

A: -- oh by -- oh yeah, oh -- oh -- oh, no, I do -- I™m sorry, I gave that im -- no, no -- 

Q: -- it should -- no, no, I™m sure that you would -- 

A: -- I -- I™m saying -- all I™m saying is it s
hould be on a sound founda
tion. I feel that the 
Nuremberg international war crimes tribunal, wh
ich was signed by 23 nations who had been very 
directly, and some  i
ndirectly involved -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and suffered by the Nazi regime , and they 
signed an accord, an agreement, an authorization, 
that a trial should be establishe
d, and these people should be i
ndicted for crimes against the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
116 
 
peace, war cr imes, crimes against humanity. Adm
itting that the crimes against the peace char ge 
is -- was novel at the time, because it -- it had no
t yet been established th
at viol ation of a treaty 
was an international crime. 
It takes a court process -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to ma ke that into law, so that was necessa
ry. And there wasn™t a country in the world which 
objected to the international tr
ibunal at Nuremberg, but how ma ny 
peopl e are objecting to what™s 
going on in The Hague, or even in Ge neva, or in
 some  of these other 
international cour -- you 
don™t have a really internationa
l court if you don™t have the ag
reement of the international 
community in support of it. Now that -- that™s my whole point. So when these people say -- and 

this is largely in the media, the 
-- the trials in The Hague where so
 and so from Serbia is going to 
be tried for war crimes, similar to the war crimes committed by the Nazis in Nuremberg, I think 

it takes away from the Nuremberg trials. It dem
eans them, because th -- it™s not the same thing. 
There™s no comparison. Now, if -- 
who voted for the establishment 
of the inter -- 
international 
criminal™s court?  United Nations. The ma jorityvote of the members of the United Nations. All 

right. If you had a vote today ag
ainst United States, do you think 
-- do you believe the ma jority 
of the me mbers of the United Nations would vote 
for, or -- in support of or against the United 
States? 

Q: I have no idea. 

A: We ll, I have the feeling we don™t have the su
pport in the United Nation
s that we would need 
in order to objectively meet 
a tribunal of that court. 
Q: So let me  go -- let me  go back to the [indecipherable] Jackson for a second. Did anybody ask 

him any que stions?  You didn™t raise thos
e questions with Justice Jackson? 
A: At that time ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
117 
 
Q: At that time .  
A: Oh, no, no I wouldn™t.  

Q: Did -- did everybody just sit 
there and ju -- they took what he said and [indecipherable] 
A: That™s right, yeah, well that™s what I say, I -- 
I wouldn™t have had the nerve. In fact, I™m -- I™m 
talking in -- in hindsight
 now, you know, hindsight is -- 
Q: Yeah, it™s -- it™s ve ry -- 

A: -- and I -- I have a lot 
of hindsight at
 this point. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- a lot of points that I™m ma
king now, of course, I had no -- no reasons for raising back in 
those days, and I was just a --
 a kid listening to what was 
going on. But in my own mind, I did 
have the questions that I ha
d me ntioned earlier, you know -- 
Q: Now whe n  you -- 

A: -- what is the Soviet role in
 this, and -- and the rest of it. 
Q: -- when you sat in on some  of the Nurember
g -- did you see the subseq
uent Nuremberg trials, 
or only the Nuremberg trials, the first trials? 

A: No. 

Q: The major trials. 

A: The major trial, yeah. 

Q: The major trial. 

A: I was home by the time --  

Q: You were. 

A: -- actually, I -- I was home 
by the time the trials ended. 
Q: Ended. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
118 
 
A: I -- I was just there 
the early part of 1946. 
Q: So given -- given that in ma ny wa ys you were
 getting pieces of in
for mation, even though you 
were interrogating all thes
e top Nazis, you didn™t have the whole picture. 
A: Oh no, no. 
Q: And you began to see it when you walked in
to these trials and lis
tened [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, and I™m still learning. 

Q: And you™re still learning. It™s
 a very complicated story. 
A: Yeah. There™s still an awful lot that hasn™t be
en revealed yet, and this is why I -- I™m very 
supportive of the efforts, for instance, of the Ho
locaust museum, and your oral history idea of 
getting some of the story told. As I say, I do a 
lot of public speaking, and it depresses me  when I 
talk to young people who have no idea what I™m ta
lking about. I™m talkin
g about high school and 
college students, and I me ntion name s like Goer
ing, Goebbels, Himml e r, Streicher, Ley, and 
they get a blank look on their f
ace. You know, who is he talking about?  Who are these people? 
And they don™t know anything a
bout the Nuremb erg trials.  
Q: Right. 

A: And the mi nute you talk international war cr
imes tribunal to a great majority of the young 
people, they™re imme diatel
y talking about oh yeah, 
that -- that™s in Bosn
ia, they™re getting those 
Serbs for raping some body, and that™s what the in
ternational war crimes tribunal is about. And 
that is my -- what I™m saying. I -- I don™t thi
nk there™s a comp arison. Th
ey™re not in the same  
level, they™re not the same  operation. So I think it™
s important for survivors to tell their story. I 
think it™s important for anybody whose had a conn
ection, even -- o-or ma ybe especially, this 
very new idea that this Dr. Latimer
 brings out in a book just -- just
 out, that Hitler wa s a victim 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
119 
 
of Parkinson™s disease. Not a victim of, but hadParkinson™s disease, and 
that influenced ma ny of 
the decisions he made. I -- I think that™s a -- an 
interesting line to follow and -- and pursue, yeah. 
Q: When -- when you think back on those months 
-- actually, it™s more than months, it™s more 
than a year that you spent with th
ese Nazis and doing interrogations. 
A: Yeah. All together, yeah, sure. 
Q: What effect do you think it had on you? 

A: On me  personally? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You know, I™ve -- I™ve been aske
d that question before. It contri
butes substantia
lly to, I think, 
my ma turity, to a certain amount of c ynicism
 I have now. I just don™t trust everybody just 
because he has a title. It doesn™t 
necessarily mean that he™s always 
right. In fact, it taught me also 
that no ma tter how important you are, you still pu
t your pants on one leg at a time . And I™ve seen 
me n whose faces were on the cover of Ti me  ma g
azine, and Life magazine, full blown, in color, 
who begged me  for an extra tube of toothpaste, or
 even a stick of chewing gum, or a pack of 
cigarettes. And they were four star generals. Th
ey were mi nisters and -- and heads of state. And 
so I -- when I then came into
 the -- the commercial world an
d started working for a living, I 
didn™t swoon when the corporate ex
ecutive -- when I called on the corporate executive to ask for 
a ma jor contribution to the Miami University fo
undation, because, you know, I -- I actually had 
under my control people who were much more i mporta
nt than he was. I don™t me an by that to -- 
to demean the person, but all I™m saying is it™s -- it stopped me  from being in awe of everybody 

who has a title, or a position. And 
in turn, it taught me to respect th
e person rather than the title. 
And that I could have more respect for a corporal
 than I could for a five star general, because 
I™ve seen five  star ge nerals that
 I wouldn™t promote to corporal. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
120 
 
Q: Right. 
A: See what I mean? 

Q: Yes, I do. 

A: A-And tha -- that™s -- that™s 
the lesson I learned. Cynicism to 
a certain extent, yes. But ma ybe 
it™s ma de me a better citizen. I question things 
I hear now. I just don™t take anything for granted 
because it comes from high above. 

Q: Did it depress you about the human condition, a
bout the capacity for huma n beings to be -- 
A: Yes, yes, very much so. And I was just goi
ng to say, that™s the othe
r thing I -- I worry my 
wife because  I -- I let news developments 
depress me , because I can see -- I can draw 
comparisons. I can™t help but feel -- and I™ve been asked this question ma ny times when -- when 

I was on [indecipherable], what is a typical Na
zi? Blonde, blue-eyed Aryan, six feet tall?  Mm-
mm. The typical Nazis, if there 
is such a thing, and there is, 
in my book, I knew some . He could 
be shorter than I am, he could be bald-headed. He
 could be fa t, he could be skinny. He could be 
mi staken for an American if I me t him on the st
reet. There is no typical 
Nazi. You don™t have to 
be a German to be a Nazi. 

Q: Right. 

A: You have to be a certain personality, a certain 
type to be a Nazi, and it™s not a physical type. 
It™s a person who fits a -- a cat
egory that would -- wouldn™t hes
itate to shoot you if it benefited 
him. Or wouldn™t hesitate to sell out his childr
en if there was some  benefi t for him. A person 
without character. And I me ntioned to you the quotat
ion from fieldmarshall Kesselring. That left 
a tremendous impression on me, because I got so 
involved as a boy in the Boy Scouts, and the 
Boy Scouts of America is about building character. 
And that stuck with me , and here is a five 
star general, a fieldmarshall -- a general fieldm
a r shall, who tells me  -- now I™m 27 ye ars old, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
121 
 
almost three times the age of the cub scout that 
I was, saying character is more important than 
anything else. More important than knowledge and ability. And I reme mbe r  that as a Boy Scout, 
that™s what I was taught. Character, integrity, 
telling the truth, being honest. Treating other 
people as you would like to be treated. That™s a
ll part of being character. When I see what™s 
happening, and I give talks and people say, Nazi
sm can happen only in Germany. I say, ﬁYou™re 
wrong, Nazism can happen here in the United Stat
es.ﬂ We  have neo-Nazis in the United States. 
Hatred, racism. I can see things repe -- I can s
ee patterns repeating themselves, because there are 
people without character, who are doing the kind 
of things that the Nazis did in Germany. And 
they™re doing the kind of things that enable them
 to come  to power. And I see patterns in our 
country repeating what -- exactly what happene
d in Germany, during the 20™s and the 30™s. A 
lack of interest in supporting e
ducation at the local level. In Ge
rmany during the 30™s, let Berlin 
take care of it. Let the governme nt handle it. 
We  don™t want to support our local schools. So the 
local gover -- the national governme nt takes over 
the school system, and they pay the teacher™s 
salaries, and they pay for the schools. And then they
 also tell them what to teach, and they teach 
only Nazism. And you can™t be a teacher in Germa
ny during those days without belonging to the 
National Socialist Teache
r™s Association. I get a 
little bit worried when
 everybody has to belong 
to the NEA in the United States be fore they can
 teach. That bothers me . Maybe no problem. I get 
worried when I see nobody wants to be a scout
ma ster any mo re. Nobody wants to volunteer for 
the YWCA, or the YMCA, or -- or the y-m-
a -- y -- young me n Hebrew asso -- the volunteer 
groups. People aren™t interested. So what ha
ppens?  Let the governme nt organize a youth 
program. Then you have a Hitler youth, and a Bal
dur von Schirach, who organizes the boys and 
the girls, because the local l
eaders don™t want to do it any mo
re. A-And this -- you can keep on 
multiplying this. If you get a media that all sings 
the same tune, I get very depressed. When the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
122 
 
me dia become s the voice for one party, who is going to speak for the other party?  Whose going 
to express their viewpoint?  The [indecipherable]
 publications in Germany released all the 
governme nt news, and it was only news when -- 
the news was only what the Nazis wanted you 
to read. And then you had the Voelkischer Beobachte
r, and the -- and the -- the Der Stueme r, and 
all the Nazi newspapers, telling 
you exactly what the news is, thei
r governme nt news outlets. If I 
feel that all the news is cont
rolled, and in support of only one 
concept, I draw a compar ison, I 
worry a little bit. There are signs. I frankly 
worry about gun control. People say to me, why 
didn™t the Jews defend themselves?  Why didn™t th
e Jews organize? I mea
n, they™re -- they™re 
smart. Not just the Jews, but the others too, mi
norities in other countries, in -- in Germany and 

countries that they occupy. What™s the first th
ing Hitler did when he came to power after the 
burning of the Reichstag?  Guns were illegal, 
confiscate all the guns. A
nd the Gestapo had the 
right to come knocking at your 
door and search your home to 
see if you own a gun. I™m against 
gun control. I™m for gun registra
tion. I think everybody owns a gun, 
like a car, ought to register 
that gun. If he has it legally, he 
shouldn™t object to that. Wa iting 
period is fine. Your picture on a 
gun license, that™s fine with me . But don™t take aw
ay my right to carry a weapon. We  did that tha 
-- we -- they did that in Germ
any. Instead we say, why didn™t 
the people up -- weren™t they 
organize -- defend themselves? With what? Pocket  knives? I think -- I interpret the Constitution 

and our founder™s purpose along that
 particular line. Our founders, 
in creating the United States, 
and our Constitution were getting away from King George and the oppression, and the 

dictatorship of that royal fa m
ily. And they created the revolu
tion, and they -- they had their 
militia me n, and their mi nute me n, who defended themselves and we have a free country. What 

if we get a governme nt that deprives us of 
all of our freedoms ?  How do we -- we™ve -- how do 
we organize a revolution in defens
e of our -- of free thinking and of free spirits?  We ll, that™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
123 
 
what it did to me. It makes me think about thos
e things that -- and it depresses me  if I am 
wrongly, or rightfully, I™m -- I™m 
not saying I™m -- I™m right, I c
ould be all wrong, but it still 
depresses me as I ma ke the comparisons. That™s a long answer to your question. 
Q: You did some  interviewing of Ge rman citizen
s before you left to go to the United States? 
A: Yes. That was a very negative assignment. We
 had some  of our officers -- this is during the 

non-fraternization pe riod. And some  of our pe
ople in military intelligence -- high up military 
intelligence, ask themselves what can we do to win these people over? I mean, the war is over, 

but the German people who -- they claim, look t -- 
to us as the liberators, those who were anti-
Hitler, but woke up to that fact much too late 
to do anything about it. By the time the German 

people realized -- and I™m not talking about an 
unknown quantity of German people, by the time  
they realized they had lost any freedom, that
 they were now living under a very controlled 
ma lignant dictatorship, it™s too la
te to do anything about it, becau
se the fear psychosis had been 
so firmly established. You know, parents couldn™t 
talk about any ideas or
 about the governme nt 
in their home, because the children would tell 
the teachers what thei r parents said about the 
Hitler -- about the government, or 
whether they listened to BBC on the radio. And people were 
afraid to talk to thei
r neighbors. The blocklighter mi ght be 
listening. [speaks German here]. That 
could also be taken the other way, the find -- th
e enemy could be the government. When people 
woke up, it was much too late 
to do anything about that. So 
there are Germans who claime d, 
when the war was over, we look upon you American
s as having liberated us from this. But 
instead of liberating us, you have subjected us
 to a fra -- non-fraterni
zation policy, you won™t 
even talk to us. Our schools ar
e closed, and they been closed 
for -- for mo nths. In the Soviet 
Union, schools were opened a week after the war 
ended, with textbooks a
nd everything already 
printed. Schools in Germany, West
 Germany, in the American zone
, and the British zone, didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
124 
 
open for nine months aft e r the war ended. Andwhen they did open, we used outdated textbooks 
and untrained teachers. We could have used a lo
t of those G.I.™s who were fraterni zing with 
German frauleins as schoolteachers, as youth 
organizers, to teach 
them something about 
democracy. But we didn™t, we mi ssed that opportun
ity. And some  of the people, older than I and 
more ma  -- ma ture and wise, thought what di
d we  do wrong, what are we doing wrong?  Let™s 
find out. Let™s get an opinion of -- of the people, 
let™s get a -- a reaction. So
 secretly, four of us 
were -- were selected. Selected 
only because we speak dialect. I 
-- I can speak the Zaar dialect 
because that™s what we spoke at home, which is
 ve ry much like the Luxembourg dialect. And we 
mi ngled a mong the German people, pretending to be Germa n soldiers returning from PW ca mps, 

we™d just been released. And we actually had 
German unifor m and -- and we just sit in bus 

stations and we talk to people. And you know, I™ve 
been a PW for the last two and a half years, 
and what™s going on, you know, what™s happening
 here?  Wha -- what -- what happened in 
Germany?  Why -- why is everything the way it 
is? Where did the -- the 
Third Reich fail?  And 
got their reactions. And what about the American
s?  What do you think of them?  And then we put 
all of that  together in a report, and then 
my commanding officer was severely reprimanded, 
because it wa s critical of the -- of the way we 
were doing things in Germany after the war. And 
so they ordered all the copi
es of this report destroyed, 
and nothing ever came of it.  
Q: Did you keep a copy? 

A: Yeah. But it was only confidential, it wasn™t  top secret . 

Q: Right. 

A: But I kept a copy of it, and I quote from it in my book. I me an, in my own quotes, my own 

opinion, because I brought it back from question. 
And we -- we talked to people who confessed, 
I was a Nazi, yes. Especially wome n, who continue
d to be very ardent Nazis and who gave their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
125 
 
opinion very freely. They were pining for the day when Ger man troops come  goose-stepping 
down the street again. And we thought that our aut
horities ought to know th
at there are people in 
Germany who think that way. And the highe
r ups who got our report said, oh, you know, you 
trying to tell us that the Germans 
are still Nazis, or -- 
that isn™ t so, we -- we™ve -- we™ve liberated 
them, we™ve done away with them, and they aren™t
 Nazis. We ll, there are Nazis in Germany still. 
Even as a tourist you can -- I can 
-- I can ferret them out when 
I™m traveling. I -- I reme mber -- 
oh, this is -- should be off the record, but we 
-- we had organized the Miami alumni tour for 
instance, in Denmark [indeciphera
ble] in Copenhagen. And -- a t
our, and I was the -- the tour 
host, my wi fe and I organized the Miami alumni 
tour. And we came in -- one of the people in our 
group, a very good friend of mi ne, a Miami alum
na, elderly woman, had hurt her knee very 
badly on the tour, she could hardly walk, she wa
s in agony and pain. We  c a me  into this dining 
room in this hotel where we were staying. Ca
me  off the elevator and my -- my lady friend 
immediately went to the nearest tabl e to the elev
ator and sat down, so she wouldn™t have to walk 
with her painful knee. And this
 headwaiter came stormi ng across th
e dining room. And before he 
even opened his mouth I could tell he was Germa
n. He was not -- no -- and not a Dane, he was a 
German, and with a very German accent, in Englis
h, he just told our friend, our fellow traveler, 
that she was not allowed to sit ther e, she had to
 go to the end of the dining room where this 
whole group is all eating together
. You can™t sit here, we will not
 serve you if you sit here. And 
he was just sounding so much like a Nazi, all I ha
d to do was close my eyes and -- and -- and see 
the SS insignia. And I lost my cool; I never did that
 very often, but I just
 went over, in German, 
and I read him the riot act in -- i-in Ge rman, 
no uncertain terms, and what I thought of hi m, and 
the Nazis and that this lady was 
going to be served right at this
 table, right by the elevator 
because she couldn™t walk very far. And that was it
. He actually clicke d his heels. He said yavolt, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
126 
 
and he served my lady friend at th
at -- and her companions, and sh
e -- served at that table. The 
rest of the group ate at the end of the dining room, 
but this part of our gr
oup ate at that table. 
Well, some of my friends coul
dn™t get over that, said, ﬁHow di
d you know he was a Nazi? ﬂ  And 
I could just tell he -- and he
 was, he was -- I™d swear he was a Nazi. [indecipherable] 
Q: We ll, we™re close to the end of this tape, so 
I actually have one more
 question, but I can™t ask 
it on this tape, so let™s [indecipherable] 
A: Maybe -- maybe it™s someth
ing I can answer yes or no? 
Q: No. But it™s the la
st question I have.

Q: We  could probably stay here all day and all

I™m sorry that we can™t cover all of it. 
A: Everything. 

Q: Right. The last -- 

A: We ll, it™s probably a good thing [indecipherable]

A: Yeah.

Q: It™s out of print?  [indeci

A: -- yeah, but K -- Kent State University Pre
ss is doing a new printing, it will come  out July

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And it™ll be in not the hard

A: -- in a soft cover. 

Q: That™s good to know. 

A: So -- but it™s supposed to come  out July

A: -- for the university press. 

Q: Okay. 

A: So we™re looking forward 
to that. It™ll be the four
th printing, so it™s -- 
Q: Oh, that™s great. 

A: -- doing pretty well, yeah. 

Q: My last question has to do with this incide
nt that happened in 1986. This was after you had 
completed your assignment as ambassador to Lu
xembourg and President Reagan was going to 
go to Bittburg, which caused a huge flurry, a
nd he didn™t change  his plans. And you did 
some thing other, didn™t you?  So 
could you explain what you thought -- 

A: It was still during my  embassy ye ars -- 

Q: Oh, it was -- 

A: -- I was still ambassador, this 1980 -- 
this 1985 or ™80 --
 well it was the -- 
Q: I thought it was ™86. 

A: No, no, it™s 1985, was the 40
th
 anniversary of the end of the war. 
Q: Oh no, you™re right, yes. 

A: Yeah. And President Reagan was co
mi ng to Europe to comme morate the 40
th
 anniversary and 
also to attend the summi t  meeting -- I forget 
in which one of the countries. And Ger ma ny -- I -- 
Helmut Kohl in -- invited him to ma ke an offici
al state visit to Germany while he was in Europe. 
And Reagan accepted, and was going to Europe 
-- was going to Germany while he was in 
Europe for the summit c onference, and it would be a 
stat e visit. Now, in a 
stat e visit, the -- the 
way it usually works is the ambassador of the 
host country and his count
erpart in the United 
States would get together and pl
an an agenda. And Hel mut Kohl
 had requested of the German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
129 
 
ambassador to the United States that the presiden
t should accept an invitation for a state visit, 
and while there he ought to visit an American
 -- a -- a German military cemetery and lay a 
wreath to commemorate -- to -- to memorialize the -- the 40
th
 anniversary and to comme morate 
the end of friction between Germany, a -- a gest
ure, a recognition of the bravery of those who 
fought, so forth, so forth. And Reagan, w
ho was pretty easily ac -- accepting recommendation, 
accepted that he would -- he would do this. I wa
s attending a birthday party for Arthur Burns, 
who was our ambassador to Germany, and Arthur
 Burns told me  that Reagan was comi ng to 
Germany for an official visit.
 And he thought that he shouldn™t visit the German military 
cemetery, that would cause a lot of
 friction. Arthur Burns knew what the score was. And I agreed 
with him. And then Arthur Burns said, ﬁ Why 
don™t you ma ke a counter-suggestion and have him 
come to the American cemetery in Luxembour
g instead?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhy don™t you, Arthur? ﬂ  

And he said, ﬁ We™re both passing the buck.ﬂ And he
 said, ﬁI™m the host ambassador and if I get 
involved it™s really a violation of
 protocol. I -- I shouldn™t do this
, because I™m -- I™m s upposed to 
go along with what the host governme nt wants,ﬂ and so
 forth. So I stuck my neck out and I sent a 
cable, and that was a mi stake. There is such a thing as a White House signal, and that is a direct 

telephone line from an ambassador to a White H
ouse office, the president, vice president, and 
also the secure -- national security advisor. And 
you use that for really important me ssages. And 
I should have been brave enough to use the White H
ouse signal, be the only time I would have -- 

have used it. You™d use it if Luxemb ourg is 
planning to declare war on the United States or 
some thing like that. But I should have used it tocall the president and tell him -- to invite him to 

come  to Luxembourg, my proposal being that the he
licopter, which is at hi
s disposal would come  
fr om Bittburg where he was making an offi cial 
visit to the military -- that was our biggest 

military base, and our most important  -- 15 -- 15 mi nutes less than, he coul d be in Luxembourg. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
130 
 
He could land in a parking lot, I had it all de
scribed, and lay a wreath at General Patton™s tomb. 
Then go down 500 yards from the American cem
etery, there™s a German
 military cemetery 
where 11,000 Germans a r e buried. And he could lay 
a wreath there at th
e tomb of the unknown 
soldier. And they could play [i
ndecipherable] and guaranteed no SS, 
Wa ffen SS is buried in that  
cemetery, the Luxembourgers would 
never stand for it. The whole 
thing would take 45 mi nutes, 
he could be back in Bittburg, no harm done
, everybody would be happy, nobody would criticize. 
But I ma de the mi stake of s -- using a regular 
cablegram, which goes to the state departme nt. 
And the state departme nt routinel
y routes this to the European 
director, who routes it to the 
president™s office as a recommendat i on from an
 ambassador. And I thi
nk Michael Dever got it 
and f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was 
in so ma ny words, mi nd your own business. This 
is all settled. And that was the e-end of it. 
I should have had the courage to -- cause I™d 
corresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I 
became a mbassador of course, but he  knew who I 
was, and it was on Dear John basis. And I 
think I could have gotten through 
to him, and I™ve kicked myse
lf ever since. But anyhow, 
Reagan came to Bittburg and he went to the ce
me tery where some Waffen SS were buried, I 
forget, 49 or some  -- what the number was. Michael
 Dever had been there to inspect the site, but 
the cemetery was covered with snow, so he c
ouldn™t tell. Well, he c
ould have gone to the 
registration office, any high school 
kid could have told him that th
ere were SS me n buried in the 
American military ceme -- Waffen
 SS. But he didn™t [indecipherabl
e] but that -- that was his 
problem, a mong others. Well, then I received 
an invitation from the Jewish community 

congregation in Luxemb ourg, that there was going 
to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same 
time that Reagan was in Bittburg at the cemetery, 
at the American cemetery in [indecipherable]. 
Would I accept to come? And my good friend, 
Mr. Ocks, who was the president of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
131 
 
congregation was very surprised when I persona
lly called him and said, ﬁOf course, I™ll come , 
I™ll be very happy to be there.ﬂ 
He couldn™t be lieve it, he said, 
ﬁOh,ﬂ he said, ﬁwe™re putting you 
on the spot.ﬂ Beca -- I had a very good relationship w
ith him, I used to gi ve talks to a roomful of 
survivors from Luxe mb ourg and -- and Rabbi Boltz
 is a -- a good personal friend, and used to 
invite him to our embassy, along with the Cat
holic Archbishop of Luxe mbourg. Wa s always a 
very in -- but they real good buddies, they were
 real good friends, h-had a 
very nice relationship. 
Talk about fr eedom of re ligion, they really have
 it over there. The re
spect. Grand Duke and 
Grand Duchess would come  to synagogue on many occasions, and it was just a wonderful 
relationship. Anyhow, when I accep
ted they were very much surp
rised, and I went. And that™s 
where I me t Rabbi Here, and also some  other me
mbers of the Wi esenthal Center. And the second 
surprise was that I was willing to ma ke a talk 
-- give a talk, and so I did. And I brought greetings 
from the president. And I was wise enough to at 
least notify the president 
that I was going to be 
there. Well, the media was there in force, and they 
really expected me  to take off and either blast 
the president or ma ke some  comment. And -- and I 
didn™t, all -- the only th
ing I said was I think 
President Reagan should be here instead of in B
ittburg, because this where he could have  devil -- 
deliver a really significant me ssage. But he™s not, and I™m here to represent him, and I bring you 
greetings and then I™m -- went in
to my spiel about how grateful 
we are those who sacrificed and 
we™ll never forget them -- made the regular
 speech for the occasion, and everybody was happy, 
except the media, cause I really let them do
wn, I didn™t -- I didn™t stick my neck out and 
jeopardize my job. But I was jeopardizing it beca
use if Reagan had taken offense, or some body 
else had wanted to take issu
e -- but Schulz was very understa
nding, and he compli mented me . 
And We inberger complime nted me  a nd they all sa
id fine, everything is great. And then Reagan™s 
own speech -- that afternoon, we went -- Wi nnie 
and I went to Bittbur
g and -- and heard his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
132 
 
speech and -- and I™ve quoted his speech ma ny times, and -- we can™t undo what™s been done, we 
can™t bring back to life those who have died,but the one lessons we™ve been taught by World 

War  
11
 is that good much triumph over evil -- I™m
 quoting roughly, good must triumph over evil 
and freedom must triumph over totalitarianism.
 And a -- we should never forget the lessons 
learned because that™ll help us ma ke a better futu
re than -- the gist of 
his [indecipherable] which 
he would build his speech. So everybody was oka
y, except the me dia, a
nd the thi -- and people 
who got the idea from some media presentations, 
with which I disagree, that he was perfectly 
willing to go to that  cemetery. Actually, at  that  point --  President Reagan was the kind of 

president who relied pretty much on his lieutena
nts. He -- he delegated, 
and he was a eight to 
five ma n, and some  of that is good and some  of it 
is bad. But he didn™t get involved in details, he 
never did. So me  presidents get too involved in
 details and that™s wr
ong, too. And you do have a 
staff, you do have people around you and a cabinet, so
 take what you will of that. But -- but 
Reagan really didn™t know -- I don™t think ever 
-- anybody ever told him that there were Wa ffen 
SS buried there. And if they ha
d, I don™t think he™d have known
 the difference, unless some body 
told him. I mean, how ma ny peopl e know the diffe
rence between the SS of the concentration 
camp type and the Wa ffen SS?  There is a differen
ce. And the Wa ffen SS, 
unfortunately, was sort 
of an elite military unit, and sort of like our 
Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Wa ffen 
SS ended up with a lot of regular SS me n in it, and 
they began to do a lot of the things that the -- 
the occupying forces, the atrocities agains
t the civilian population, and of course the 
concentration camp, the thing [indecipherable] so 
there was a -- a definite mi x, but the president 
wouldn™t have known that. In f
act, I don™t think anybody 
in his staff would have particularly 
known this, unless some body told them.  

Q: We ll, I want to thank you so much fo
r being so gracious with your time  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
133 
 
A: We ll, and -- 
Q: -- and your experience. 

A: -- I™ve enjoyed -- it™s brought 
back a lot of me mories, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and so -- 

Q: And wha t  we™re going to do is stop the camera now, and then come  back and show a few 

photographs. 

A: Okay, yeah. 

Q: And you™ll explain what they are. Okay. 
– And who is this very attractive young lady? 
A: That very attractive young lady was my wife. 
And that picture was taken on the last day in 
civilian clothes. She and I spent the day in our fa
vorite park in Cincinnati,
 where we were living 
at the time. So Wi nnie and I were wandering aro
und the park and visiting different places that 
were very dear to us, celebrating the last da
y in -- before I had to go into the army.  
Q: And this picture? 

A: And this is in Eden Pa rk in Cincinnati. And 
this is the last  pict ure 
taken of me  in civilian 
clothes for four and half years. The following 
day I went into the army at Fort Thoma s , 
Kentucky.  

Q: And this one? 

A: Now this is the ot her extreme, almost the 
last day in uniform. This picture was taken in 
Germany with my own Jeep, you™ll notice that™s
 Jeep number one, and the name  on the -- the 
windshield is Johnny Mike, our firs
t-born son. We had the privilege in those times of adding our 
own na me , or any name  we choose to our Jeep
s and I name d mi ne for our first-born son, Johnny 

Mike.

Q: Okay, and this picture? 
A: This is the Palace Hotel in Mondorf, Luxe mbourg. It was the special de tention center, code  

name d Ashcan, where we kept the high ranking N
azis during the summe r  of 1945, in preparation 
for the Nuremberg trials. The 10 foot barbed wi
re fence comp letely around the compound, and a 
machine gun tower in each of the four corners, 
indicates the security be
ing taken to keep the 
prisoners in, and any visitors who mi ght want to 
take justice into their own hands, out. But that™s 
the Palace Hotel -- 

Q: And this is not a legal -- 

A: -- nickname d Ashcan. 

Q: -- this is not a legal pi ctur e. 
This was taken clandestinely, yes? 

A: That -- that™s
 right, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Actually taken clandestinely by a Luxembour ge
r, who wasn™t supposed to know what™s going 
on inside there, but he did. And it was actually du
ring our embassy years that he gave it to me , 
said it™s the pictur e I took, along with several ot
he rs. This is the Palace Hotel when it™s still a 
Palace Hotel, also a casino in connection with
 the spa, the health resort, which ma kes up 
Mondorf and is the ma jor industry in Mondorf. But when you put the fence around it, the 

machine gun towers, and the camouflage nets, then 
you have Ashcan. This is the peaceful Palace 
Hotel, which incidentally has since been torn
 down. And the Luxembour gs -- the Luxembourgers 
decided they needed a more modern casino, and they 
also felt that they din -- didn™t wa nt this to 
become  a national shrine to which Germans could 
ma ke pilgrima ges, and pay tribute to the Nazis 

last home. So they tore it down, and bi -- 

Q: Okay, so who is this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
135 
 
A: This is a group photograph that actually appe
ared in Ti me  ma gazine in their November 1945 
issue, after we open up our facility
 to the media. Time maga zine t
ook this picture, they called it 
the class of 1945, with the class president, Hermann Goering, the Reichsma rshall, occupying the 
most prominent place. The Reichsmarshall consid
ered himself the -- the leader still, even though 
he had been defr ocked, more or less, by Hitler. 

Q: And who s e that? 

A: His comp etitor in this part
icular case was Grand Ad mi ral Ka
rl Doenitz, who had been name d 
by Hitler to be his successor, so
 that in this situation, both Go
ering and Doenitz comp eted with 
each other for leadership of the class of 1945.  

Q: And this picture? 

A: Now this is a close-up of a -- a section of
 the fence that completely surrounded the compound 
where Ashcan, the Palace Hotel was located. The 
bottom strand of wire, barbed wire, has a sign, 
[speaks German] because that was the electrifie
d wire. If you stepped across that one, then you 
took your life in your hands. This is one of the machine gun towers. There were four of them on 

each -- one on each corner of the fence on th
e compound. A ma n with a 30 caliber machine gun 
and two armed guards. This is the entrance to th
e Palace Hotel. And the guest just  being ushered 
in, carrying his own suitcase, 
is Baldur von Schirach, the Hi
tler youth leader and former 
gaolighter of Vienna. This is one of the rooms 
inside the Palace  Hotel, which served as the 
barber shop and also as a first 
aid office for the doctor and a de
ntist who took care of the -- the 
inmates.  

Q: And this room?  

A: This is actually one of the rooms in the Pala
ce Hotel. As a ma tter of fac t , it happens to be 
Hermann Goering™s room. Note that the complete 
furnishings are the folding army cot, which did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
136 
 
have a straw mattress on it, and th
en a rather shaky chair, and ta
ble, and a washstand. Iron bars 
on the window, plastic Plexiglas. 
And the view from that particul
ar room of the approach, the 
gardens of the Palace Hotel is on this pictur e. 
We did allow the prisoners to walk in this 
particular area inside the barbed wire enclosur
e. By comparison, when the prisoners were moved 
from Luxe mbourg to Nuremberg, they were put into
 a Franconian state prison, and this is one of 
the cells in that Franconia state prison, where th
ey spent their time all during the course of the 
Nuremberg trials, both before and during the trials, until they were sentenced to deat h, or moved 
to prison in Berlin. This is a
nother view of the same  cell with
 the window and a new paint job. 
Q: Could you just go back up here so you can see 
that the to -- they were the toilets -- 
A: Note -- note the ni che in that  cell, that actua
lly is where the ho -- the toilet is located with the 
stand pipe and a flush button at the top, which R
obert Ley, the leader of the German labor front, 
the arbe itsfront, used to strangle himself with 
a pi ece of towel, by sitti
ng on the toilet and putting 
force against the noose that he had ma nufactured 
and fastened to the pipe. When he was on the 
toilet he was out of sight of the 24 hour gua
rd who was outside his door, checking on him. 
Moved the spotlight  over the door -- o-over the -- 
the window in the door on the -- this is the 
dining room in the Palace Hotel in Mondorf wh
ere the prisoners ate their meals, served on 
porcelain plates with spoons only, no knives or
 forks permitted. The food was prepared by 
ordinary German prisoners, who also did the se
rving. [indecipherable] Ri
bbentrop eating -- this 
is at the mess facilities in Nuremberg, before they
 were being served in th
e individual cells. Note 
the me ss kits, and the regular fare that prisoners
 -- prisoner of -- prisoners
 of war are consuming 
by rules of Geneva Convention, 160
0 calories, no more, no less.  
Q: Now wha t  is this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0408  
137 
 
A: This is the pass, a very rare
 one, issued by the internal secu
rity detachme nt. If you had this 
pass, you were permitted in the war criminals 
wing of the Nuremberg prison, where only the 22 
ma jor Nazis were to be tried in the first session of the tribunal were being 
interned -- interred -- 
interned. 
Q: Interned. In turn. And in tur
n. Now start -- what is this one?  
A: Yeah, this is a -- the pass that admits you 
to the Palace of Justice,
 the -- the court session 
itself, and also the officers in the area. The 
other pass entitled you to the war criminals wing 
only. This pass also entitled you to visit the Nazi
s in another wing, who were not being tried at 

the first session tribunals. 

Q: Okay.
