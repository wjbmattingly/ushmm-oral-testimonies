Bayside, NewYork 
 
Q: Today is March 29, 1992, I amAnthony DiOrio 
and I am at the home of Mr. Gerald Grossman, 
Bayside, NewYork.  I am here on behalf of th
e United St ates Holocaust Memorial Museum to 
interview Mr. Grossman about 
his experiences duri
ng the Holocaust.  Good morning, Mr. 
Grossman.   
 

A:Goodmorning.   

 

Q: Perhaps we could begin by your telling us
 when you were born and where you were born. 
 

A: I was born in Rovno, Poland at the time, 
it™s part of the Ukraine, December 20, 1923. 

 

Q: When it was part of Poland? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Could you tell us 
about your parents. 
 

A: My parents were of Jewish religion and my 
father was born in 1900, worked as a tailor all his 
life, my mother was a housew
ife and was born in 1902 in Rovno. 
 
Q: And how many brothers 
and sisters did you have? 
 
A: I had three brothers, excuse me , and a 
sister. We  were five children all told 
 

Q: We re you the oldest? 

 

A: I was the oldest of the five. 

 

Q: What was it like growing up in Rovno? 

 

A: We ll, I thought it was O.K.. As a child I went
 to school and my father
 worked always very 
hard.  Sometimes day and night to support the whole family because he was the only one 

working in the family to provide.  My lifewas, I would say, norma l, according to the 

circumstances in that particular 
town during the Po
lish occupation. 
 

Q: For example, your father as a tailor, did he have his own shop? 

 

A: We ll, at certain time s he did have a shop for hi
ms elf but most of the time he worked in a small 
town which is eight kilome ters
 from the city of Rovno, it™s ca
lledAbarrov (? ) and he worked 
there as a custom tailor for the people of commer
ce that lived in that town and he was always 
hired by them by the week to work and he used 
to move into their homes while he was sewing 
for the whole fa mily. 
 

Q: And was he originally fro m that town? 
 

A: No, he was from Rovno but he used to go away 
for the whole week and come  back to the house 
on Friday nights for the weekend, like for Shabbat. 
 

Q: How did he come  and go? 

 

A: Most of the time he would walk 
the eight kilometers to come home
 or he used to take a train.  
That was only about twenty
 mi nute™s ride by train. 
 

Q: You me ntioned going to school.  
Wh at kind of school did you go to? 
 

A: I went to all kinds of schools. As a child, and 
I can give you exactly the, before I went to public 
school, I must have been six, five or six, I used
 to go to Cheder.  Like
 to a rabbi to learn 
Yi ddish.  I used to go to a smallTa lmudTorah 
also before, and then I went to public school, 
which was compulsory at the time, when I was 
seven years old, in Polish public schools. And 

after I finished, I went to a 
special school, specialized school 
sponsored by ORT,Ame r ican 
ORT, for three years to learn how to become  
an inspector for tailors which was only about 
twenty boys. Specialized for the Polish governme nt
 to spread them all over Poland to become  
inspectors. 
 

Q: Is this what you wanted to be? 

 

A: Ye s.  Each tailor that opened up a shop had to 
have a diploma, a ma ster ™s diploma, before he 
could open up and he had to get it 
from this kind of inspectors to 
see if they are good tailors or 
not. 
 

Q: So, conceivably you ma y have become your father ™s  inspector? 

 

A: My father would have be
en probably too old by then. 
 

Q: So you went to Cheder until you were 12 or 13? 

 

A: No, I went to Cheder in the evenings after 
school and the rest of the time I spent in public 
school. 
 

Q: Until what age did you finish public sc hool? 

 

A: 1936 and then I switched over to that speciali
zed school, ORT, which happened to be that we 
were supposed to graduate just 100 days befo
re the war started.  No, the 100 days before 
graduation the war started and that
 interrupt ed the whole thing. 
 

Q: And this was in 1939? 

 

A: 1939,yes. 

 

Q: So that was a public government school as well? 

 

A: It was, no, it was a private school sponsored by ORT.  

 
Q: The governme nt didn™t subsidize it? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Your brothers and sister, did th
ey follow you in going to public school? 
 

A: We ll, my, ye s.  My second brother and third 
brother were going to public schools and the little 
ones were not of school age yet. 
 

Q: What languages were spoken at home? 

 

A: In my house  we spokeYi ddish.  Outside we spoke Ukrainian and Polish. 

 

Q: How were relations between Jews and non-Jews in Rovno? 

 

A: We ll, the city of Rovno i t self there wa s, I would 
say, eighty-five to ninety
 percent Jewish and so 
we used the Polish language andYi ddish and we 
had very little to do with other nationalities 
except school where we used to get together. There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it 

and that was part of life, so
rta. So we accepted it as it is. 
 

Q: Do you recall any specifi c inst ances of anti-Semitism?  

 

A: We ll, yes, there was plenty.  I, myself, before th
e war, my looks are not, t
ypical sort of Jewish.  I 
have blue eyes and not a typical.  I used to be
 able to walk on the other side where the church 
was standing, the Polish churc
h.  It was called Koschua (? ) in
 Rovno where I observed and read 
the literature put out in front 
of the church against the Jews 
and anything that was possible to 
print and ma ke hatred.  So I used to relay th
is information to others because it was a little 
dangerous to walk on the other side of the street
. And that™s  the only kind of a thing.  I came 
across, myself, before the war, cer
tain episodes like, when I used to
 walk to visit my father in 
Abarrov.  I had to pass a little section where onl
y Polish people live and 
as I was walking some  

youngsters would attack Jewish guys. The episode
 was that as I was walking on the street, one 
was screaming in Polish, ﬁDer isYi d, der is 
Yi d_______. That means, ﬁis a Jew, catch him.ﬂ  
When the other friend of his came and said are you 
a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew? And 
some how because of that asking the question where 
is the Jew, he was puzzled.  He didn™t  know 
I was Jewish and he let me  go. This is the ki
nd of things as youngsters we knew. There was 

anti-Semitism. 
 

Q: We re any of your brothers accosted in similar ways? 

 

A: No, my brothers they were younger and they di
dn™t  do out of the house that much. The y didn™t 
travel outside the city of Rovno so they didn™t 
have any experiences like that, except going to 
school. 
 

Q: How about your teachers at 
public school and private school? 

 

A: Well, I personally di dn™t have any problems with
 teacher s. The only thing I did have a problem 
was because I was Jewish, they transferred me  fr om the school that was ne xt to my house to 

two kilome ters further, which was Degrabnik all th
e way in the back of th
e town.  I had to walk 

every day to go to school, two kilometers each 
way, yet there was a school next door to me. 
 
Q: Did you live in the center of Rovno? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Wa s it a Jewi sh neighborhood? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: How about relations between 
your father and his customers?  
 Earlier you mentioned that he 
provided customized tailoring for farmers and so forth. 
 

A: Ye s.  He had good relations with them.  
There was no problem at that time, among the 
Ukrainian people, and my father that worked for 
them.  He used to stay in their houses, they 
treated him like thei r own. 
 

Q: When he walked, he wasn™t  approa
ched the way that you were approached? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: You me ntioned that school wasn™t  the big pr
oblem, but I a m just wondering whether after the 
1935, after 1936 with the death of Pilsudski, whet
her you saw any changes either in the school, 
or in the town? 
 

A: Ye s.  Right after the death of Pilsudski, wh
ich the Jewish people liked, there was another 
Marshall, I think his name  was Rydz-Smi gly and 
his government looks like change.  Because as 
a youngster I realized that we had 
a lot of trouble. The first thing, I think that the government 
was infiltrated with German people and they ma
de new laws, especially for the Jews. Where 
they ma de them eat non-kosher foods, they didn™t 
allow them to kill like the Jewish way of 
kosher, and I think the wo man was called Madame 
Priestar oba that was in charge of all this 
business.  Just to give the Jews a little problem. 
 

Q: Did this affect you in anyway in school, for example? 

 

A: Personally, in school it didn™t affect us but
 I remember there was a lot of problems among the 
Jews for that problem about Kashrut. They
 didn™t eat meat because they wouldn™t eat non-
kosher meat. 
 

Q: Did these changes affect
 your father in any way? 
 

A: I couldn™t tell at the time, I was too young 
to understand. All I knew there was no kosher food 
for a long time  and there was a strike against 
the governme nt and the Jews didn™t eat any meat. 
 

Q: We re you a good student? 

 

A: Fairly good student. Ye s. 

 

Q: Did you pay any attention to politics? 

 
A: Somewhat.  I did not get into
 it although I had a friend whose 
father was a communist and was 
in jail for five years for communis m and he was a 
good friend of mi ne and we used to talk about 
other ways of life.  I was only studying this but 
I didn™t belong to this ki
nd of group at that time . 
 

Q: What was the political or
ientation of your parents? 
 

A: We ll, ma inly Zionist orientated. Ta lking a
bout Israel all the time.  Judaism. We  had 
organizations, Zionist organizations all 
kinds. There was_______________ there wasAgudas 
Yi sroel, there was a lot of different Zionist 
organizations and I belonged to some  of them. 
 

Q: Which ones did you belong to? 

 

A: I belonged to onceAgudasYi sroel, which is th
e religious Zionist orga
nization, I also belonged 
to a Socialist sort of organi
zation, I also belonged to a So
cialist sort of organization 
like______________.  So I used to walk from one place to the other. 
 

Q: Did anybody in your family, extended fa mily go to Palestine? 

 

A: One of my c ousins, which is my father ™s sister ™s
 son, left for Israel in 1935 and he just recently 
died in Israel.  He was one of the first Halutzim
 they called them, that volunteered to go to build 
Israel.  It was in 1935 and I me t hi m fo
r the first time after the war in 1968. 
 

Q: Do you recall any discussions during these ye
ars about Hitler and th
e Nazis in Germany? 
 

A: Yes. When Hitler took over, I think it was in
 1933, after that on the radi o people used to get 
together and listen to the speeches and all the prop
aganda they used to put out against Jews and 

other things.  I reme mbe r  as a child, as 
a youngster, that people were very upset. 
 

Q: Did you recall your father speak
ing about Hitler and Nazism? 
 

A: My most of the time  was  out of the house, wh
ich I told you before, and we didn™t have a chance 
to talk politics with my father. 
 

Q: How about your mother? 

 

A: My mother did not get involved with politics.
  She was a plain ordinary housewife taking care 
of her children and times were not good, economi c times were pretty bad before the war and she 

did not get involved in politics. 
 

Q: Did you live in an apartment?  

 

A: We  lived in an apartment, yes, we didn™t ha
ve our own house. The house that my mot her had 
when she got ma rried, my grandmother came back from the United St ates and sold the house 

and made them move out because one of her brot
hers had to go toArgentina and they needed 
the money and that was it for the house. 
 

Q: So you had family me mb ers who had been toAme r ica? 

 

A: Ye s. 
 

Q: Wa s there any thought of leaving Poland, or 
Rovno, at any point for economi c reasons or for 
other reasons? 
 

A: No. There was no thought. We  didn™t have the 
means to mo ve out and the fa mily was too big 
and, I guess, that was the aim to stay in Rovno. 
 

Q: Did you know, in describing the diffe r ences 
between Jews and non-Jews, any differences 
between the Poles and the Ukrainians in the way 
in which they were treated you or treated each 
other? 
 

A: No. We  didn™t  have, I personally as I said befo
re, we used to walk to that villageAbarrov where 
my father used to work and we had very good relations with the Ukrainian people. We  never 

heard any anti-Semitic things agai nst the Jews, and I 
used to ha ve fr iends that used to pl ay with 
Ukrainians. 
 

Q: Did you have Ukrainian friends? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Did you also have Polish friends? 

 

A: Ye s, we had Polish friends in school. 

 

Q: When the war begins did it come as a complete surprise? 
 
A: No.  It didn™t come as a complete surprise b
ecause, as I said, the propaganda and the talk on the 
radio and all the preparation that the Polish governme nt ma de  be fore the war like digging, in 

Polish they call it____________ ditches ag
ainst bombs, places to hide
.  It was prepared before 
September 1939. 
 

Q: How much before? 

 

A: I would say about a year.  
Everyplace in Rovno we dug ditches 
to hide against bomb, shelters. 
 

Q: FromGer many? 

 

A: FromGer many. 

 

Q: So the German attack was expected? 

 

A: It was expected, yes. 

 

Q: And how about the Soviet Union?  Wh
at was expected of the Soviet Union?  
 

A: We ll the Soviet Union was not ex
pected. That was a surprise. Th
at was called a blitzkrieg, sort 
of, against the Russians. That™s  what happened in 1941, June the 22, 1941. 
 

Q: The German attack on the Soviet Union.  
I mean the Soviet Union ma rching in Poland? 
 
A: Oh, excuse me . The Soviet 
Union, that was a surprise, yes. The Soviet Union the way we 
know made an agreement with Ge
rmany to split Poland in half. 
 I guess the river Bulg was the 
borderline where they had the border, Poland was di
vided at the Bulg.  My 
part of the territory 
fell into the Russian side. 
 

Q: Did you see any Russian soldiers in 1939? 

 

A: JustRussians. 

 

Q: Just Russians. At the time that the Russians came  in, I was in that town ofAbarro because we 
thought we had a lot of friends in that town. In 
order to hide from the war. My father took the 
whole fa mily to that town ofAbarro. And some  of the fa milies took us in– 
 

Q: Ukrainianfamilies? 

 

A: Ukrainian families took us in and when the Ru
ssians were approaching the Ukrainians were not 
so happy about that. They would have rather 
had the Germans come  in than the Russians.  
Somehow I assume that the rela
tions between the communist Russi
ans and the Ukrainians were 
not so good and they were afraid for the Russians.
 And as the Russians came  in they asked us 

to leave their house and go back to our house which we did. 
 

Q: The Ukrainians asked you to leave? 

 

A: `Yes, the Ukrainians. They didn™t want to keep us.  So the whole family was walking from that 
town, eight kilome ters, already 
with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the 
Russian military, and we also walked back and 
as we came to the city of Rovno, there was a 
guard checking everyone who came back into the town. 
 

Q: Did they give you any trouble? 

 

A: No. They just looked at us, ch
ecked us out and see, they wanted
 to see if we are not bourgeois 
capitalist, and they let us in. 
 

Q: So they decided you were not bourgeois? 

 

A: That™s  right, thy d
ecided that we didn™t
 look like bourgeois. 
 

Q: So your father was afraid that his family would be in danger. Wa s he afraid that there would be 
bombings? 
 

A: Ye s, they were afraid that there ma y be bombi
ngs or maybe attacks on Jews, so he was safer in 
that little town with hi
s friends that he knew all the time  
than he was in the city of Rovno.  
That™s why he took the whole fa mily out. 
 

Q: Wa s there any destruction 
or attacks on Jews in Rovno? 
 

A: Not at the time  when the Russians occupied. 
The Russians just walked in the city of Rovno.  

They were attacked by the Polish army and 
by the Polish police in 
the city of Rovno. 
 
Q: Who was attacked? 

 

A: TheRussians. 

 

Q: So there was Polish resistance? 

 

A: There was Polish resistance in both parts of
 the main streets of 
_____________ it was called at 
the time  in Rovno, I reme mber there was a militar
y church where they were hiding, the Polish 
police was hiding and as the Russian soldiers wi
th their equipment were comi ng in they were 
shooting at them from be hind the buildings and some
 of the m got killed an
d then they killed all 
the police that were shooting at them.  Because the next day, as I walked out, when the Russians 

were there already, I walked out and I saw 
a lot of them killed, police lying on the ground. 
 

Q: How did you feel when you saw this? 

 

A: We ll, I didn™t feel so good to see that 
people, it was not an interesting sight. 
 

Q: Seeing the Russians come  in and take over from 
the Poles, is this something to thei r cr edit?` 
 

A: We ll, for us as, I would consider ourselves 
poor fa mily, the Russian people that came into 
Rovno was better for us. We  accepted them, the 
whole city was not so ba d off when the 
Russians were there because of the city wasn™t  that rich and for my personal family, it was 

good. The economic times got better for us as a poor fa mily. 
 
Q: So the Russian occupation was not necessarily a bad thing? 
 

A: No, it wasn™t  bad in compar
ison to the Polish government. 
 

Q: We re there any changes in 
particular under Russian rule? 
 

A: Ye s, all the rules changed. There was a change
 in the system.  It was a communist system and 
everything, they had propaganda and telling a
ll the people that it™s a 
very good system and 
they™ll like it and it™s  going to be better for everybody. 
 

Q: How about walking back and forth, the eight kilo
me ters, that your father walked so often. Wa s 
that safer or less dangerous? 
 

A: It was not dangerous because most of the Polish 
army that was walking on that same road with 
us, were giving themselves up to the Russian people. 
 

Q: How about the Ukrainian far mers that your fath
er knew so well, did they lose their farms or 
suffer in any way? 
 

A: In the beginning they still kept their far ms 
but, I understand that later on they had to give up 
their farms to the Russian governme nt and work
 with them as co-hosts whatever they 
established at that point.  But personally when
 the Russians came  in I was going to school and 
then I transferred to a Russian controlled sc
hool where they taught us
 Russian language and 

continued education. 
 
Q: So you had been going to that private school to
 become  an inspector, you went to a different 
school under the Russians? 
 

A: Ye s, that was not necessa ry anymore because
 the Russian governme nt didn™t have the same  
system as the Polish government so I gave up the w
hole education that I had for that purpose.  I 
went to a Russian public school 
for a short time , and after awh
ile I read an announceme nt that 
they are looking for students 
for a specialized school and I si
gned up. This specialized school 
had to do with railroad working, on the railro
ad, which was located in Zdolbuniv, twelve 
kilome ters from the city of Rovno. The school 
wa s very nicely organized, we had dormitories 
where we stayed all the time and we were lear
ning Russian and also sp
ecialty in locomotive 
work, locomotive engineering, building cars, rail
road cars, and after that to work on the 
railroad. 
 

Q: So you were preparing to be a machinist? 

 

A: Yes, I graduated to become a locomotive en
gineer, driving a locomotive which I liked very 
much, and after I graduated they sent me  toa place to work, which was called Kami onka 

St r u m i
owa located about twenty
 five kilome ters from Lubov, the city of Lubov.  It was also 
located on the German border, very close t 
the Ge rman new border, which was in Poland. 
 

Q: When did you graduate? 

 

A: I graduated in 1941. 

 
Q: And that™s  when you went to the city? 
 

A: That™s  when I went to work. 
A few months ma ybe three or four
 months before the wa r started. 
 

Q: Meanwhile your fa mily. Now you 
separated several hundred miles. 
 

A: Now, I separated for about 200 to, I would sa
y about 300 kilome ters from the city of Rovno, 
and I was already on my  own just in touch by writi
ng letters and that™s  all.  I was already grown 
up at that time. 
 

Q: How was yo ur fa mily 
doing during these years? 
 

A: My fa mily, my father was still working as a ta
ilor and there was not muc h different than it was 
before. 
 

Q: Your brothers and si
ster were growing up? 
 

A: My brothers and sister we re growi
ng up and I was not in touch with them. 

 

Q: You don™t reme mber anything special happening to them?  

 

A: During the time  that I was gone, nothing especia
lly happened to my fa mily, they were growing 
up and I was there until the war started.. 

 
Q: We re you thinking of getting ma rried? 

 

S: No. 

 

Q: Just trying to get 
your first real job? . 

 

A: Just getting myself establishe
d.  I always wanted to grow up, 
my aim wa s to grow up and to 
help my family.  Because I was the oldest one and I saw how much they were suffering 

economically, I felt that with the ed
ucation that I got I would be ab
le to help them, and that was 
on my mi nd at all times. 
 

Q: Who was pa ying when you went to the private 
school and then to the Russian school, who was 
paying for your education? 
 

A: I was always sponsored.  My parents did not ha
ve the means to pay for my education, so I was 
sponsored by the ORT organization. Then when the Russians came in there was no charge. 
 

Q: So you were here in Lobov when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union? 

 

A: Ye s, I was in___________ and that™s when th
e real business star
ted, right there. 
 

Q: What did you see? 

 

A: On June, would you like to
 tell me  the whole episode? 
 
A:ﬂ Sure.  One June the 22
nd
, early in the morning about 4 o™cloc
k in the morning, being that I was 
on the border and working on the railroad at 
that particular town_________, in the morning I 
saw airplanes overhead fi ghting with Russian airplane
s. That was the start of the war. Already 
I saw one airplane shot down by the German airplane
s and that pilot landed not far from us.  He 
parachuted out.  I saw the Germans were flyi
ng around him while he was being parachuted and 
they were shooting at him flying down. They made
 a few holes in the parachute, but they didn™t 
get him and he safely landed. That™s  how 
we knew that some thing was going on between the 
Germans and the Russians. At 12 0™clock that 
day, the, Molotov at the time, announced that 
there was wa r and attack on Russia and there wa
s war between Russia and Germany. The first 
few hours while I was there, 
the railroad lines between___________and Lutzk was cut.  So, we  
            already were paralyzed on the rail
road because the Germans bomb arded the railroad and no 
trains were comi ng into our sta
tion.  My chief of the station kn
ew about that, that we were 
paralyzed.  He was upset, he had 
his whole fa mily, he was a Russian.  He was the chief of that 
station, and I worked under his comma nd. And, he 
said to me that you stay
 over here I will take 
my fa mily with the children and take them out 
to the city of Lubov.  I saw that there wa s no 
reason for me to stay at the station becau
se there was no communication and there was no 
connection between the stations al
ready, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying 
all by myself in that station.  I knew the Germans 
were close by, so I said why do I have to stay 
here, there is nothing to do anyway now, why 
won™t I go with you and help you to evacuate 
your fa mily to Lubov and then we will together co
me  back to the station to work. We ll, he 
agreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it 
was the only locomotive left on the station. We  
camouflaged one of the cars traveling to Lubov. 
We never made it back, because the Germans 
occupied that part and from ther
e on we did not stop in Lubov, but
 we got connected to another 

transpor t and we travel ed towards the Russian 
territory in the east, by train, and we had, I 
reme mber, a open platform train, where old cars 
were open like platforms and we took that train 
and we traveled to Rovno which took us a coupl
e of days.  I would say about three days to 
travel from Lubov to Rovno because of the bomba
rdme nts from the air by the Germans.  Every 
time we heard airplanes we had to
 stop the trains, run off to the 
sides, hide because they were 
shooting, they were flying very 
low and shooting at us with th
e automatic machine guns from 
the airplane s. When they were gone, we 
continued until I came to__________where I was still 

assigned to the railroad and this_________, which 
I me ntioned before was twelve kilome ters 
from Rovno.  I think it was June the 25
th
.  Being that___________ was onl
y twelve kilome ters 
from Rovno and my fa mi ly lived in Rovno, and I 
didn™t see them for a long time, I decided to 
go to Rovno to see my fa mily.  I was assigned to 
a post to be back at 10 o™clock at night, to 

watch a certain part of the ma in terminal of__________and I was free until 10 o™ clock that 

evening.  So I went to Rovno and met my fa mily. 
 

Q: They didn™t know you were comi ng? 

 

A: They didn™t know I was comi ng, they were ve
ry happy to see me , they thought I was already 
dead, ma ybe , or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardme nts while I was in 

Rovno.  During the day the German a i rplanes used to 
fly in and bombard sections of the city.  In 
order for my  fa mily to be safer, I told them 
to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that  

was the other part of the 
city, like one section is towards east 
of the city like facing the Russians 
and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue. 
 

 Ta pe 1, Side 1 
 

A: To bring them over to that part of thetown was already late and I had to go back 
to____________where I was assigned to be there at 
10 o™clock.  Because about 7:30 or  8™clock, 
I left my fa mily, I said goodbye to my father, my w
hole fa mily and (a portion 
of tape is blank).   
 

A: I am going to repeat a few sentences. When 
I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in 
the day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I 
was assigned. We  didn™t know at the time that 
the Germans are going to take over 
most of the territory. We fi gured it™s just  a temporary thing 
and the Russians are going to be
 able to fight back the German
s and life is going to go on 
normal.  I was responsible for my job where I wa
s in Slobonov so I had to leave my family.  My 
mother did not want me to go back.  She insisted I should stay with the fa mily, in that 

synagogue.  I spoke to my father, he was more  lik
e sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I 
reme mber a nd I™ll never forget it, he said, my
 son, you are a grown man, you have to make your  
own decisions what to do.  If you
 think that it is important for 
you to go back, then
 you have to 
go back.  So I had no problems with
 my father, but my  mot her wa
s insisting I should stay with 
them.   I ma de up my mi nd to go back because I fe
lt that if I don™t, I will 
be responsible for the 
job I™m supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a ma jor depot place where 

soldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they ha
d to be transported from
 one place to the other 
and it was important for me  to be there.  So, 
I said to my parents th
at I™m going to be there 
tonight. After I finish my job in the morning I™
ll see you back.  I™ll come  back to the city and 
see you again.  On the way to Slobonov walking, I 
walked out about six kilometers, about half 
way, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an
 attack.  It was sort 
of getting dark that 
day, already late in the day, and 
I was walking with the road of the railroad, that ™s how I came to 
Slobonov and a lot of pl anes were comi ng toward
s us and there were another few people and 
everyone was hiding and I was also hiding from t he airplanes. We  didn™t know they were going 

to attack us, they were flying very low and 
I saw the m go t owards Rovno, towards the city of 
Rovno. A few mi nutes later I looked
 out, all the airplanes they spr
ead like sort of in one line 
and they attacked the city of Rovno from one e
nd to the other. And a few mi nutes later I saw 
the whole city burning.  I was six k
ilome ters out of the city.  It wa
s very hard for me  to ma ke a 
decisi on what to do now.  I didn™t know whether my fa mily was killed at the time or not, 
because the city was on fire from one end to the other.  I made a decisi on to go to work because 

I figured like that.  If I don™t go to work and 
nothing happened to my fa mily I would be a  

deserter, be cause I was sort of mobilized alrea
dy by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and 
then they will kill me  as  a deserter, the Russian
 governme nt.  If my fa mi ly is dead, I won™t see  
them anyhow.  So I dec i ded that in the morning 
when I finish my work, I will run back to the 

city.  Being that I came back to Slobonov I wa
s on my place of work, 
watching the cars on the 
outside.  I was assigned to that, 
we had a fe w attacks in the mi ddl
e, like already da rk later on, 
we had attacks by the German airpla
nes on the railroad, on the station. 
 

Q: On your station? 

 

A: On the station that I was working. A whole 
group of people started to 
run out of the station 
because they aimed at the depot, at the station where I was working. And I ran out to the 

outskirts of Slobonov. We  went into a house 
a few kilome ters from the depot, from the 
Slobonov station and I walked into the house and I said
 I have to stay here, I have to rest until  
this thing is over and I™ll have to rest here in
 your house and the woma n did not disagree, she let 
us in, there were a few me n already sleeping on 
the floor, and she said I have no room, the only 
place I have is on the floor.  If you wa nt to accept it, 
it™s  O.K.  I aske d her, 
I said pl ease, if I fall 
asleep, wake me up, but early, ea
rly in the morning.  Being t hat I was tired and I didn™t sleep for 
a few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I wa s ve
ry tired so I fell asleep on the floor.  I wa s  

so tired that the woma n just co
ul dn™t get me up early in the morn
ing and she let me  sleep.  She 
didn™t know the reason why I had to
 be up early. About 8 o™clock, 
sort of, in the morning I got 
up.  I said, why didn™t you wake 
me up, I was supposed to be on the station working. We ll, I 
walked out of the house and I ran towards the sta
tion where I was supposed to be working. As I  
came close to the rails, I saw German tank facing
 a column of Russian soldiers with their gun 

from the tank pointing at them and all the Russian
s with their hands up we
re standing in front of 
their building fr om that colum
n. And I couldn™t figure it out 
that the Germans were there 
already because I didn™t see Germans until that poin
t, that  was the fi rst tank I ever saw German 
except in the air, the bombardme nt.  
 So I walked around behind the tank. 
 

Q: You didn™t have a uniform on? 

 

A: I had a uniform, I had a railroad unifor m on 
but not a Russian soldie
r uniform and behind the 
tank I just passed, they
 didn™t mi nd me  they only wanted 
the soldiers and they didn™t do 
anything to me.  So I walked right up. It was an
 uphill, I walked up to the railroad and I went 
into the station and I 
took a look.  During the night most of
 the trains and locomotives were 
evacuated going east while I was asleep and I didn™t see anybody on the station.  Everybody 

was evacuated.  It was empty.  It was a very f
oolish, stupid episode that if you™re interested I™ll 
tell you that I carried a little suitcase, I had so
me  underwear, clothes that I had and I put it in a 
warehouse when I ca me down with the train fr
om Slobonov originally, and it was in that 

warehouse.  I figured if I have to run I got to 
have my suitcase so I ran to that warehouse and 
there was still an old woma n closi
ng up to run away too.  I said to her, I have my suitcase with 
my clothes in it, I would like to
 get it. There were hundreds of
 suitcases lying there, I was 
looking for my personal suitcase wh
ich didn™t have much to look 
at and I found my suitcase and 

with the suitcase I ran towards the smoke that 
I saw going east from the chimney. The s moke 
was comi ng out of the locomotives, they were
 going one after the ot
her probably about two 
kilometers away from the station al ready. 
 
Q: To the east? 

 

A: To the east.  I decided to go as fast as I can
 towards those loco motives 
and they were going very 
slow because they couldn™t, looks like ahead of
 the m they had some problems, s o they were 
traveling very slow and I coul
d catch up with them, and the la
st locomotive was a fr iend of 
mi ne that also was operating that locomotive. 
When he saw me  run he slowed down and he 
picked me up. And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia.  Never had a chance to 

go back to Rovno to see if my  fa mi ly was alive or dead. And this was the last time I ever saw 

my fa mily. 
 

Q: June25? 

 

A: About June 26
th
. 
 

Q: Your mother was afraid for you or afraid for herself and fa mily? 

 

A: I think my mother was, she wanted to keep th
e fa mily together.  Bei
ng I was the only one out 
working, so she wanted me  to be with them. 
 

Q: Did you ever find out what happened to them? 

 

A: We ll, after I was working, I wa
s on the railroad traveling aro
und for six months, I wa s assigned 
in Russia to be on a group of rail
road people, a special transpor t th
at would be kept in case they 
need us for work with the military.  So as th
e Russians, which most of the time they were 
retreating, the Russian army, we were like sort 
of behind the lines traveling back and forth in 
case the government would need a transport for so
me reason.  So I was on the railroad for si x 
months, just living in cars with a whole gr
oup, hundreds of people, of railroad people, that 
worked on the railroad for the purpose of re
storing the railroad if it was bomb arded, for 
transpor ting military back and fort.  So my job at 
the time  was just  to travel. That ™s why I lived 

and as the Russians were retreating so did we wi
th the transport we were retreating. Where we 
got up to a town further away from
 Harkov.  I don™t reme mber that
 town that we stayed. As I 
was working on the station over there we actually parked at that pl ace and we worked at the 

station and I used to go out to see all the tran
sports that were comi ng by this station going east 
towards Russia and they called them_________, people 
that run away from the occupied areas 

of Ger many, people that were running away
 from the front. Wh oever could evacuate 
themselves, they were passing by our station and 
I was checking every car 
to look for relatives, 
friends from the city of Rovno.  
Wh ether they were passing by t
oo. And I looked into every car 
as they were comi ng by.  I me t one guy and he 
was a son of one of our landlords and he knew 
my fa mily very well.  He met me and he told
 me  t h a t  my  fa mi l y,  my  fa t h e r,  me t  h i m o n  t h e  
station in Harkov, that ™s a city in Russia. 
 

Q: Faraway? 

 

A: It was in the Ukraine.  It 
wasn™t , I don™t know exactly the m
ileage how far it was from Rovno, 
but it was st ill the Ukraine.  He said to me that
 my father approached me  and asked him whether 

he saw me . And at that time, nobody saw me , and he
 said to my father, no. We ll, he repeated 
those words to me  when he me t me .  He said 
my  father asked if I saw you, but I did not see you 
until now.  He knew that, he said to me that the 
whole fa mily and my fat her were in a school in 
Harkov, and they were waiting for evacuation fu
rther, or some thing.  He continued and I 
decided to go to Harkov, which was already evacuated. 
 
Q: When was this now? 

 

A: This was in 1941. 

 

Q: Monthslater? 

 

A: No, not that much later.  I would say maybe  a mo nth.  Sometimes, I woul d say, in July.  I don™t  
reme mber the date.  Bit I decided to run and take
 the fi rst transport that goes there and being I 
worked on the railroad, I could travel and I trav
eled towards Harkov.  I walked on the streets, 
which were deserted. There were no people in
 Harkov anymore.  I tried to find some body to 
direct me  to a certain school, 
I came to that school
 and nobody was there. I came back to the 
same  city I worked and did no
t meet anybody in Harkov. The 
whole city was deserted and 
evacuated. That was the only information that 
I ever had about my family. Wh ether they 
rema ined in the city, whether they we re evacuated some place, whether they walked out, I will 

never know. 
 

Q: This person that you describe
d, he™s  the last person you know. 

 

A: He was the only one that I ever me t. 

 
Q: That was July? 
 

A: It was some time in July in Harkov. And that™s  it.  Since then– 

 

Q: And after the war you never found out. 

 

A: After the war, I™m going to jump a little bit. 
After the war I managed to get out of Russia, I 
traveled, they told us that we will go to Poland.  Rovno the city of Rovno rema ined under the 

Russian government after the war, because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed 

hands back to Poland.  On the way back I ma na ged to get out of Russia and we were supposed 

to travel towards Kovid, it™s a 
city, Kovid, and my transport got
 diverted instead of going to 
Kovid, went towards Rovno.  Over
night was traveling and in th
e morning I get up and I walk 
out on the station and when I opened up the doors,
 we stopped at that station, and as I opened 
up the door I see a church, the one I mentioned 
before, a Polish church, which I recognized, I 
figured that every city in Poland, I knew I wa
s in Poland but I didn™t know which town, I 
figured in my mi nd that every city in Poland ha
s a church like that.  So I say this must be 

Poland already, because I see the church is just 
like the one we had in Rovno. The rest of the 
town was completely bo mbarded, it was leveled.  So as I walk out of the station, I didn™t 

recognize the station, it was also bombarded, demo
lished, and I asked one ma n that was passing 
by, I asked him, I say what city is this?   He 
says to me  this is R
ovno.  Can you imagine the guy 
telling me , I was born in Rovno,
 I knew the whole city and I 
didn™t  recognize it.  Only 
recognized the church that was sticking out.  It 
looked like they never aime d at churches or big 
synagogues because that surviv
ed in the city in Rovno. 

 
Q: Synagoguessurvivedtoo? 

 

A: One big synagogue which looked like a churc
h. The ma i n synagogue in the city of Rovno 
survived, and I visited Russia recently and I saw that synagogue.  I was in there. 
 

Q: How about the one in which your family was hiding in? 

 

A: No, that didn™t survived.  Most of the houses were demolished.  I couldn™t even recognize the 
area where my fa mily was.  It was completely re
built. The whole city was rebuilt.  It had only 
happened a few years ago when I wa s there. When
 I saw this in Rovno, I wasn™t  able to remain 
because my transpor t was going toward Kovid a
nd Krakow and I had to stay on the transport 
that was taki ng me out of Russia until I came to
 the borders of Poland, and we entered Poland 
some wheres near Krakow. When I first got off,
 on the fi rst station as we entered Poland in 

1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us 
out and we imme diately noticed the anti-
Se mitism right away was worse than it was in Ru
ssia. They greeted us with hatred and you can 
understand what kind of feeling I 
had and I thought I ma de a mi st
ake comi ng back to Poland.  I  
came back to Poland only to have freedom, but I didn™t find it in the behavior of the Polish 

people.  So I travel ed fro m there to a town which was Bittem.  It was somewheres, I think it 

was__________, the town of Bittem.  It used to be
 a German, a lot of German people used to 
live there before the war. When
 I came  to the town a group of
 Zionist, young people, came  to 
the transport and asked all the young Jewish peopl
e that came from Russi
a to join the Zionist 
organization and from there go to Israel.  Being 
that I was single and I didn™t find my fa mily, I 
knew I was all alone and young, I deci
ded to join this organizati
on which I was with them for  
quite a while and working with the organization in
 Bittem.  If it was of interest  to you, this 
whole organization was trying to snuggle into Isr
ael.  It was Palestine at the time , under the 
British occupation and the situation at that  time 
before the Jewish St ate was established, was 
controlled by the British and they didn™t allow any 
Jewish people to settle, they took them all to 

Cypress and other camps where they caught them on the open seas.  But, nevertheless, we all 

tried very hard to get there one way or the ot
her, because Poland was no more a place for Jews. 

During the time I was in that particular place,
 I was assigned from the organization to go on the 
ma rket and buy out all the soap, which was ca
lled Rif, in Germany it was called__________, it 
was ma de out of Jewish people 
and openly the German people on 
the market were selling that 
particular soap in bags.  It looks like it must ha
ve been with the help of
 the Israeli governme nt 
or the Jewish governme nt, we used to buy that soap out of the ma rkets, wherever we saw it 

being sold and eventually, I understand it, that so
ap went to Israel, it was buried because it was 
ma de out of Jewish people™s  fat.  So this was on
e of my jobs in that  pa
rticular organization in 
Bittem. We also tried to fi nd children, Jewish 
children that were kept  in some Christian homes 
and we tried to buy them out from the Christian pe
ople to be able to go back to Israel. And we  
managed to find a lot of Jewish children thro
ugh certain ways and investigations who had 
children like that.  Some Christian, Polish familie
s took in very, very young Jewish children and 
they kept them as their own. Which was very 
nice.  Some  Christian families did not want to 
give up their children.  But a lot 
of them decided to allow them to go back to Israel where they 
belong and we paid, the Jewish 
government, the Israeli governm
ent paid a certain amount for  
them as a price for the good deeds that they di
d.  Later on, I am not going to go into details 
about what happened when Poland attacked, 
the Polish governme nt attacked our house. 
 

Q: The  building– 

 

A: The building where the Jewish organization was 
we had ninety people in this building and in 
the mi ddle of the night they tried to attack, the Po
lish army tried to attack us, which we resisted. 
We  had some guns with us but th
ey decided and not ge
t into that 
building. That building was  
closed, it had a gate, pretty strong gate and th
ey didn™t break the gate
.  Some how they went 
away and this what happened over there. Th
is was in Bittem, and 
we called on the telephone 
the Russian military which was stat ioned in that
 town, and the Russian military told us on the 
telephone that they don™t interfere 
with the Polish governme nt.  S they didn™t  want to help us. 
 

Q: When did this in
cident take place? 
 

A: This incident took place, 1946. There came  
an order from, it looks like, you know we were  
involved with the_________ and other organizations
 that worked underground from Israel to 
bring the people, the Jewish people into Israel 
at the time. An order came for us to depart 
Bittem, start going towards sort of It aly and we
 had to go to another 
town which was called 
Katowice and from Katowice we had special pape
rs ma de for  us like new na me s and the name s  
were given to all the ni nety people, more than 
ninety because families of these youngsters that 
lived outside of this particular  building were also taken at  the same time so all of us were given 

Greek name s, each one had a Greek name  sort of, 
that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping, 
going to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the 

mi ddle of the night, one night, we smuggled the 
border from Poland to Czechoslova kia. We  
had a special guide in the mi ddle of the night. Old and young, were walking through the woods 

in the dark and people were falling and it was 
raining that night, and 
was mud on our feet, but 
we had to go as fast as possible because the gu
ide he knew the way and he was going fast.  So 
the whole length of that echelon, all the people th
at were going in one line sort of, it stretched 
for a long way, we ma na ged to get in to Czechos
lovakia. And we had an assigned building that 
was waiting for us. They took us to that partic
ular house. We  came i n all muddy with shoes 
full of mud and wet.We  had to wash ourselves ou
tside in the mi ddle of the night and from there 
we had to go, the woma n from the house took care 
of us, and we had something to eat and early 
in the morning they brought a tr
uck, a flat truck sort of, ma ybe
 about two feet high, flatbed not 
covered, they took all the older people and th
e children, the young children, on that truck, and it 
traveled to Bratislava.  Lying down on the tr
uck like from________, that wa
s the town that we 
started, right on the border to Bratislava, the 
older people were lying 
and they were covered 
with a canvas, and that™s  how they
 traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in 
Bratislava for the refugees. The younger pe
ople were assigned to go by train so being 
that________ is a tiny little tow
n, didn™t see too ma ny peopl e, slowly two by two, a boy and a 
girl, walked towards the train station and we wa nt
ed to buy tickets. As we went to the station, 
two by two, not in a group, the station ma nager,
 whoever was there, 
noticed that so many 
people are here.  He never had that ma ny peopl e goi
ng by train to Bratislava
 that he called the 
police, the Czechoslovakian police, the polic
e came and arrested us .  Naturally we had 
documents that we were Greeks so we had t
o, Greek we did not know how to spe a k, so we  

spoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the pray
ing book, so sort of this kind of language sort 
of we spoke. We  didn™t understand each other, bu
t we ma de believe that we speak Greek. They 
arrested us, the whole group. A J e wish organi
zation in Bratislava found out that we were  
arrest ed by the Czechoslovakian police, they work
ed very ha rd and they got us  out and they 
transferred us to Bratislava into that  hotel wh
ere we were going to leav
e Czechoslovakia. They 
didn™t want us there.  So we 
were lucky that they didn™t send 
us back to Poland be cause we 
really smuggled out of that country with false 
papers. When we got to Bratislava  they 
organized a group of, about 200 people, to go to th
e border to come  toVi enna. The leadership 
that was in charge of that group had a pe
rmission to take out twenty people out of 

Czechoslovakia on the border crossing. They made
 200 out of that twenty
, they added another 
zero and they took 200 people on that
 particular document. When we came to the border, they 
gave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a c
ouple of cartons ofAmerican cigarettes.  So 
we crossed the border and now we are in no-ma
n™s land. We  came to the Russian side which 

was part ofVi enna. 
 

Q: The Russian occupation zone? 

 

A: The Russian occupation zone ofVi enna. They ga ve them a couple of bottles of vodka and they 
let us through.  So we boarded a streetcar in 
Vi enna and with the streetcar we went to the 
American side ofVi enna  and we stayed in th
e Rothschild Hospital inVi enna. That was like 
sort of a place, we organized th
at hospital as a transition pl ace, 
a pl ace for refugees until it was 
time to go further towards Italy.  My uncle Men
achim was with me at certai n times.  He found 
me  in Russia. That was my mother ™s  youngest br
other.  He was in the Russian army and then 
he was bombarded and shot.  He wound up in 
certain parts of Russia where he found me  
accident ally and I was with him at
 certain pl aces. Which, if you ar
e interested, late
r on I will go 
into it.  He volunteered during Ru
ssia he volunteered to the ar
my and we separated again in 
Russia.  He was in Czechoslovaki
a until the end of the war even 
after the war, fighting Germans 
and some how he survived and he wound up in__________, in a camp, displaced persons camp, 

where he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. All the Zionist 

organizations had a conference in this camp a
nd through one person at 
the conference he found 
out that I was inVi enna on theAmerican side 
in Rothsc hild Hospital. That person at the 
conference took a me ss age to me  telling me  
about my uncle that he is living in_________, 
which at that time I did not know 
where it was, and I should pick
 myself up and travel with the 
next transport that passes by Linz and he™ll wait
 for me. Well, I excused myself from this 
organization because  I was with the Zionist organi
zation going towards Israel
 all this time, and I 
said my uncle was there and if you don™t mi nd I want 
to travel to meet him.
 That was the first 
relative I ever found since the wa
r started. And, as I was trave
ling, they gave me  permission 
and I was traveling towa rds Linz .  He was waiti
ng for me , he didn™t know which transport, but 
he was waiting for one transport to the other 
until he found me  on the transport.  But the 
transport was not supposed to st
op in Linz, only stop there for re
fueling or some thing, water. 

That transpor t was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel. And as I 

came to Linz I knew that some body was going to wa
it for me  at the station.  I looked out the 
window and he spotted me  and he was in sort of
 a Jewish with a St ar of David on his sleeve, 
with a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform
 Jewish Police, with a hat.  So somehow the 
Austrian police at the station allowed him to get 
me  off that transport and take me  with him. 
And that™s how I was able to get into this par
ticular camp or displaced persons camp.  He signed 
me  into that camp whi c h was a little hard because this particular camp__________ did not 

allow new people to sign into that camp. The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters, 

relatives that were there and if 
they found them they allowed them
 to take into the same  roo m 
they had in the camp.  Because there was no room 
in this camp for newcomers.  He managed t o  
do that by saying that I was his 
brother, not a nephew and I was ab
le to get into this camp under  
the name  of Grossman, which was his name  too, 
my na me  was changed a few times before that, 

so I accepted the name  Grossman.  He accepted the name  Grossman because he knew that in 

America his brothers name s were Grossman, so 
he didn™t want to ma ke
 complications, so he 
marked the name Grossman and I became a Gr o
ssman which I was a few times before when I  

met him, and that™s how I am a Grossman all th
is time  it would be too hard to explain to 
anybody why I am notTa nnenbaum, but Grossman. 
 So under Grossman I live in the United 
St ates si nce I came here. 

 
Q: Whatyear? 

 

A: 1948. That™s  after the present. 

 

Q: Now earlier we left you– 

 

Ta pe 2, Side 1. (Something is mi ssing 
in going from tape 1 to tape 2)  
 

A: We™re in Zagorsk and we 
built that–; it was called in
 Russian_____________, in Russian. And 
that™s the railroad that  will protect Moscow because St alin decided, and we did. We did and we 

ran it around Moscow and when Hitler came  cl
ose to Moscow, about twelve kilome ters, from 
one part of this railroad, he 
probably saw it and he saw Moscow
 already through hi
s binoculars. 
But he never crossed that railroad and the ra
ilroad many times was bo
mbarded and destroyed 
and rebuilt and stuff like that. There was an or
der by the Russian governme nt to take all these 
railroad people that were working, hundreds, 
maybe thousands that were all around Russia, 
around Mosc ow, excuse me , to ship them, and they
 were getting ready in St alingrad and this 
must, I don™t reme mber the time. 
 

Q: Would this be after the winter? 

 

A: I don™t, I can™t recall the time when St a
lingrad ma de the_______.  Maybe in 1942 or the 
beginning of ™42, some thing like that. 
 

Q: You passed the winter near Moscow? 

 
A: Yes. When I found out that th
is transport is going to St alingr
ad and I figure they are pushing, 
according to the infor mation I got, I knew that I am going t o have to fi ght for St alingrad and 
probably get killed like everybody el
se did.  But I decided to go deep
er into Russia. And I took 
a group of four guys, four railroad 
people that I knew; they were 
from Kovid, from my area.  I 
told them, I said, now we™re not going to work
 on the railroad anymore, looks like we™re going 
into some  kind of a diff erent uniform and we™re 
going to have to fight or shoot or some thing 
like that, because the whole transport is going to
wards St alingrad.  If you want, I say we should 
do another thing and go some place else.  Bei
ng that we didn™t know where to go, but we 
decided, all the five of us, decided to escape 
from that place because we are not needed 
anymore, in the mi ddle of the night we went fr om 
that place.  We  we re not arrested or kept 
under special supervision, but if some body would 
see us go away from that transport they 
would be suspicious.  So in the mi ddle of the night
 we decided to go to th
e railroad station that 
was not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is
 possible to go deeper 
to Russia, deeper in 
Russia because the Germans were very close.  
We  found, I particular no
ticed a transport that  
was assembled with cars from th
e Moscow Metro and they were al
ready stationed, they were on 
platforms, platform beds on the railroad cars 
and those cars were hoo
ked up next to these 
particular platform station.  I said to my frie
nds, I say, look, I don™t know where, but when I was 
in Moscow I saw these particular
 cars in the me tro, in the unde
rground, in the subway.  I think 
that these trains are being evacuated because they 
are valuable trains, they were very nice and if 
they are evacuated they are not going to the fr
ont they are probably going toward deep into 

Russia.  If we manage to get on this particular  trai n we will probably go towards Russia, 

because we did not get infor mation where the trans
port is going.  So that train took off and went  
to a town of Gorki, which was north and east.  
It was, now I reme mber, it was wintertime, it wa s  

cold, so it must have been between ™41 an
d ™42, because I froze my hands some place near 
Gorki. We went into certai n, there were cars, on
 flatbeds, there were al
so trucks standing on the 
platforms so we ma naged to get into a door in
to the trucks and we were traveling in that 
particular truck in the cabins al
l the way to Gorki in the cold. When we  got to Gorki, we found 
out it was Gorki, we really didn™t know that we™r
e going to come  to Gorki. We  came to Gorki 
we saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. We 
were still in the uniform of the railroad. We  
had our uniforms  on. We  went in 
to speak to, there were passenge
r train, a lot of refugees were 
there in Gorki and they didn™t allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were  
wounded soldiers from the front sort of going de
ep.  Being that they 
were wounded soldiers, I 
didn™t think that these soldiers are going toward
s the front, they were going to deep into Russia 
for treatment. So we dec i ded as railroad people to go with them, but they didn™t allow us to go 

into the inside of the train to the compartments 
because they were soldiers and we were railroad 
people, but they allowed us to stay in between th
e cars on the outside a
nd travel till the next 
station, ma ybe we™ll find another transport somepl
ace else. We  traveled for a while.  I know 

when I came off I was all frozen, my hands were 
frozen and all the othe
r guys were all frozen 
traveling in between th
e trains and we got out of Gorki. We  ma naged to hook onto some  
refugee trains later on in the cattle
 cars. When we got into some  cars there were also refugees 
from Europe, from Russia, from all different to
wns and we managed to get in there with them, 
travel to Quebishov, there™s a town Quebishov 
and from Quebishov they took us toTa shkent, 
we got off inTa shkent, that™s Asia already. 
 On the way we  had a lo
t of trouble because the 
sanitary ways were very bad and we had lic
e and sicknesses and ty
phoid and all kinds of 
sicknesses among the people, but we
 ma naged, I ma naged to get toTashkent.  InTa shkent as a 
railroad guy and as a student for a cer
tain school in Russi
a in_________, I ma de an 
appointme nt with the chief of th
e railroad from theTa shkent.  
I was lucky enough that he ma de  
an appointment for me t o see him and when I got 
up there, he was an old ma n, he was the chief, 
the Kami sar, they call it, and I to
ld him that, I told him a little lie
, that we were bomba rded o the 
road as I was traveling and my transport that 
I was with disappeared and I ma naged to come  
here and I am looking for a place to live and to st
ay and to work on the railroad. We ll he gave 
us a place, he told me  O.K., you as a machin
ist, you know me chanics, we™ll give you a job on a 
machine on a certain machine to work, but the 
other four I don™t have any place except for a 
place inTashkent to work on the same machine th
at was cutting railroad ties for the railroad. 
They would be pushing the trees up to the machine 
by hand and that will be their job.  He gave 
us a place to live inTashkent, a dorm. They took 
us into places where we could clean ourselves 
up and delouse ourselves and we liv
ed there.  I lived inTashkent
 for about nine months working 
on that ma c hine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in 

that pl ace.  Before I got the job, I was sleeping 
inTa shkent on the railway station where every 
morning hundreds of people died, th
ey took out, they found in the 
morning. They used to clean 
up the station, they found dead people from t yphoi
d that they used to pick him up and just 
throw him on the wagon. These were all refugees, and I couldn™t live like that, that™s why I  

went to look for that job, and I was lucky enough 
to be able to get that job and signed in to 
Ta shkent under the name of GedaleTe nenboim.  
And I worked there for nine months  with the 
machine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim ca me down to the station.  He passed through 

Ta shkent, he was on his way to the Polish army
 with a group.  He was dismissed from the  
Russian army, he was wounded in his thigh and 
his mouth, but the Russia
ns did not trust the 
Polish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so 

that before the Russians took over. They told them
 that if you want to go and join you can join 
the____________army in Russia which was forming up there. When he stopped on the way to 

Guzar which was near theAfghanistan border,
 that™s where the Polish army made, accepted 
their recruits.  He stopped inTa skent and he f
ound a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked 

him what, who are the people that he knows th
at are from Rovno.  Maybe there are some  
people.  He mentioned to him that I know ther
e is one guy GedaleTe nnenboim that comes here 
every morning, I used to work nights on the machine.  In the morning I used to go to the station 

to look for relatives, whoever passes by or who 
stops ma ybe I™ll find some  relatives of my 
mother or father or brothers or 
sist er.  He met me  and he said, he used to meet me  all the time 
and we used to talk to each other. When he 
saw my uncle he didn™t know that he was my uncle ;  
he only me ntioned my name  as there is one
 guy GedaleTe nnenboim that works here in 
Ta shkent.  He said GedaleTe nnenboim, that™s my
 sister ™s son. To make it short, he went to 
the____________ bureau in Russia, inTa shkent, wher
e everybody that works in the city, not as  
a refugee, but if he wor ks there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city.  I 

was signed in the books where I work and my name  
was right there.  He looked it up and they 

told him where I am, he came to the place where 
I was working and I™m not going to go into the 
details how we me t.  It was qui
te a scene and he told me  th
at now that I 
have found you, you 
have to go with me.  I said I can™t leave the m
achine.  I™m working at 
night, night is my ti me 
when I have to be at the machine. There are fort
y people working on this pa
rticul ar machine.  If 
I don™t show up they can™t  work. And he says never mi nd, he says, you™re going with me .  He 

had a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with hi m. A lot of the m 

disappear ed on the road so the list got smaller and smaller.  One of the names fr om that 

particular list I took.  I don™t reme mber the name  
and I decided to go with him.  Naturally, I 
deserted my  job and I was shaking pr etty 
badly because if the Russian_________, or the KGB 
would find me , they would probably hang me .  
The next morning I was already back on the 
station with all of the refugees
 and the way I came toTa shkent and the next morning there was a 

train going to this partic
ular spot of Guzar_________ near
 theAfghanistan_______ border 
where the Polish were recruiting me mbers to go to
 England from Russia. And I went with him 
and took one of the names on that list that he 
had. And on the way ther
e was, they call it an 
ablava the Russian_________ were ch
ecking all the people on that
 station and checking their 
passports, their names. All my  passports, all my  
documents, all the pictures that I had with me I 
had to destroy at that particular 
station.  I went into the toilet, 
threw out all my pictures of my  
fa mily, of my brothers, whatever
 I had with me , my parents, all docume nts under the name  of 

Tenenboim, all my passports, and my  documents th
at I had and I had to 
destroy because I was 
sort of a deserter from this pa
rticular work place and that was 
the end of my name Te nenboim. 
From there on I took the name  wha t  was on that paper, I don™t reme mb er the name  because it 

was a very short time  and we went to Cuzar. A
nd when I came  to Cuzar with my uncle to sign 
up to the Polish army to fight the Germans from 
the English side.  It was supposed to take all 
the Polish people.  Bring them to sort of Pale
stine, from Palestine they took them back to 
England and fight from ma ybe down there.  I don™t know what the English were going to do 

with them, but help the English people fight Germ
any. And we wanted to sign up. When they 
took me  for  a me dical examination, which they undr
essed us completely. At that particular 
point in Cuzar I was rejected because they f
ound out that I was circumc i sed and I am Jewish, 
not Polish even though I spoke Polish and my  un
cle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland, 
but because we were Jewish they didn™t accept us. 
And they gave me a document, in Polish it 
was written_________. They gave me  a document unde
r the name  of Grisorus which was the 
original name  of my uncl e , and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they ma de me Grisorus 

and since then I was Grisorus. And I had to leav
e. They didn™t accept me or my uncle.  From 
that point on the Russians had to go back to 
Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a 
Polish born person, they took me to differ
ent places of work, ca mp. They called 
it___________. That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that 

were not take n to the Russian army because we we
re Polish citizens and they only took us from 
one camp to another camp and they shipped us to
 places of work like farms where they needed 

workers and all ki nd of different places, from one 
place to the other. Th
e last  place that I was, 
because I can™t go into that cert
ain.  I have to skip over that. 
 
Q: You were all over the place?   

 

A: I was all over the pl ace and they worked me  ve
ry hard. The last place 
we were was Danscoya.  
In Danscoya I was with my uncle.  He decided 
to volunteer to the army  and he escaped from 
that particular town into the 
recruiting place of the Ru
ssian army.  He wanted to volunteer to 
fight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took, 

‚cause they needed people to fight, and he was a
ccepted.  He left me  behind in this particular 
place, this was Khazikstan and not 
far from_____________, the place was called 
Danscoya____________.The place was a place where they 
were digging ore mi nes and also had 
political prisoners.  It was 200 kilome ters 
from___________.  It was very hard to escape from 
there because the wilderness was all around the pl
ace of Danscoya.You couldn™t escape.  Even 
the prisoners couldn™t escape.  It wa s 200 kilome te
rs to walk in the w
ilderness some  wolf or  
they had wild animals on the road, they w
ould eat you up.  So nobody c
ould escape from that 
place and this is the last  place I was. When the war ended  I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen 

to go back to Poland.  I had to
 provide certain docume nts, which I didn™t have under the name  
of Grisaurus.  I showed a picture with epaulets
 that I kept.. That particular picture I didn™t 

destroy because there was nothing
 written, but was only written
 some thing in Polish with a 
stamp on the corner from the school that I went 
to in Poland in Rovno. 
And that particular 
picture I kept with me .  I still have it today,
 a copy of it in my album and because of the 
epaulets, it was from a Zionist organization, so 
we had those in Poland and the corner of it was  
written in Polish from a Polish school.  It wasn™t written Rovno because that part of Rovno was 

not on the pictur e, like a corner of the picture wa
s showing but it was written in Polish so they 

could read it. They accepted me  as a Polish citizen only because of that pictur e and I was able 
to get documents to ge t out of Rus sia under this picture, under this docume nt. That™s how I  
came back to Poland where I met my  first anti-Semites near Krakow.  
 

Q: That was some  experience.  In your work 
I know you worked in private research, you were  
never able to find out what happened to the re
st of your fa mi ly?   Either through your uncle. 
 

A: Ye s I have applications
 with the Red Cross who 
are looking into it now.  
It will probably take a 
year, but I don™t believe they will
 ever find it.  My father would 
be today, if he was alive, he 
would have been 92 years old and my mother 
would have been 90.  My younger brothers 
recently.  My younger brothers I can™t find them, 
but I™ m looking for them for the last fifty 
years.  I have documents over here that I wrot
e every place you could think of to look for my  
fa mily.  I wa s under the impression because of the information that I got from that friend of 

mi ne in Harkov that told me  that he me t my
 father, that ma ybe they are alive in Russia 

someplace. And I did everythi ng.  I wrote to Mo
scow, I wrote to HIAS, I wrote toYa dVa she m 
in Israel, any organization that 
is availabl e, pr ivate organi zati
ons, that are searching for people 
and I never was able to get an
y information whether they are 
alive or dead.  I was under the  
impression for many years that they are alive. 
 I was hoping, and even to
day I still hope, that 
ma ybe they are alive.  But I have
 doubt.  Just re
cently the last year  I ga
ve up and I decided, no, 
they are not alive.  I went to 
see the graves three and a half ye
ars ago to the city where I was 
born, Rovno.  I took my wife and my  daughter, who 
was born in the United St ates, and we went  
there for a vi sit to the place where 17,500 Jews of
 that city was shot, murdered by the Germans  
with the help of the 
Ukrainian police ove
r there in the place of Su
sneke, the woods, which I 
knew before the war very well and they were all s
hot. They assembled all the Jews, most of the  

Jews, and they were shot there between N
ovember 6 and 7, 1941, right after the Germans  
occupied the city. A few months
 later they destroyed all the Je
ws. Wha t ever was left later on, 
they had another 5,000 Jews and they kept them 
in ghettos and they were killed also. And 
another place, which was called Bially St reet, I 
visited that particular
 place.  I am under the 
impression that my whol e fa mily was killed ove
r there and the information I got was false. 
 
Q: You mean the friend of yours who saw them?  

 

A: I don™t believe it.  Because I di
d all the years, I di d all I could to look for them and I can™t  find 
anybody. 
 

Q: Did you recognize some  of the na
me s on the mo nume nt that you saw? 
 

A: The monument, I put in my 
fa mily™s  name  on the monume nt  down there now, because in 1990, 
the end of October 1990, I visited Rovno again to the opening of a big monument that the 

Russian government put up in pl ace where the Jews
 were killed.  Because up till now there was 
no me ntion that Jews were killed over there.  Only
 sort of Russian citizen
s.  But now they have 
a big tremendous monument with pl
ates all around that particular
 monument.  I have a picture 
of it, I™ll show you a picture of th
at particular spot, it™s tremendous, 
it™s  very big.  Seventy plates 
with 4,000 name s of people that sort 
of got killed in this place are wr
itten. And I al
so registered 
my fa mily there. 
 

Q: Did you recognize other name s there? 

 

A: The na me s I didn™t see, I only know that after 
we left Rovno in 1990 where I visited, the plates  
were written. The other writing was inYi ddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian on the monument for  
the fi rst time in Russia that they allowed things 
written inYi ddish in places like that.  Because 
the other towns, every town in the Ukrain
e has a ma ssacre place__________ has one, Ludsk has 
one, Kiev, Kovid has one__________ has one. All these towns, every town there was a 
ma ssacre place where they killed the Jews. At th
at time  they didn™t think of sending them to 
concentration camps. Therefor
e I don™t believe I™ll get any knowledge from, any infor mation 
from_________, Germa ny because they did not take na
me s of the people that they were killing 
in the towns. They just surrounded them, they told them to c o me  and they just killed them. The  

information that I got from Rovno where I me t peopl
e, Jewish people are 
still living 
in Rovno, 
they told me  the whole story of what happe
ned and how it happened.  I me t a woma n in Rovno 
that survived, which I have on vi
deo.  She survived the graves, 
she crawled out of the graves 
because that night she was not hit by bullet.  She survived and crawled out nude and she ran to a 

Christian, a Ukrainian or Polish I don™t reme mb er 
what she said, and they kept her and helped 
her to get dress and wash and she is one of the su
rvivors.  I met her in 
Rovno, she is there today, 
she is an older woma n a nd she is one of the survivors. 
 

Q: Did any of the survivors know your fa mily? 

 

A: Down here in NewYork I have some people 
that knew my family. The people in Rovno that 
are there today did not
 know my  fa mily. 
 

Q: So your last image of your fa m
ily is that in the synagogue on the 26
th
 of June 1941? 
 

A: Right. 

 
Q: And you we re going back to work? 

 

A: That was the last time I saw them, ye s.  In 1941, I was probably--. 

 

Q: Eighteen. 

 

A: Eighteen years old?  Ye ah. 

 

Q: St artingout_______. 

 

A: That™s  right.  Five years of
 my youth was just destroyed. 
 

Q: Do you recall saying go
odbye to your brothers? 
 

A: Oh, yes. There is a picture in my mind at all 
times.  It never leaves, that pict ure.  I will never 
forget because I reme mb er when I said goodbye
, my father took me  around and hugged me  and 
kissed me .  My mother was crying and she wa
s practically, like sort 
of hysterical, like she 
would know that I™ll never see her again. Whe n I 
left her, I tried to be like a grown person 
because I had tears in my eyes. At the time, th
e tears are comi ng back t o me  right now as I™ m 
talking to you, I didn™t want to s
how her that I™m like sort of a 
sissy that I™m cr
ying and I didn™t 
turn my head back. 
 

Q: Your brothers and sister? 

 

A: They were youngsters, they were 
kids and they didn™t understand much. 
 

Q: Any further observations? 

 

A I am working now with Holocaust Search for 
the same  purpose. That I know so ma ny people  
are looking for relatives and I don™
t think there is a better person 
than I am and dedicated more 
to that cause because I, myself
, have the feeling and I know what it me ans to lose family and 
not to be able to see them again. 
 

Q: Thank you Mr. Grossman. 

 

A: You™rewelco me.
