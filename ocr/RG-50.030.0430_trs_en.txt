e d we  had over 200,000. 
A: Over 200,000, 
almost a quarter of 
a million people we 
had in the ghetto. 
A: But then, very shortly the fi
rst tra nsport was organi zed.  Wher
e the rough ele me nt wa s sent out  
first.  And then a lot 
of volunte ers  ca me to be out  of the  ghett o. 

Q: Di d the y sen d 
a  lot  of very, ver y poor  pe opl e?  
A: By what  do you mea n , very p
oor  peopl e?   Ever ybody wa s poor!  
Q: Wh at I a m wo nd erin g is
, was their a hier archy in t he ghet to 
in terms of the population?  So me 
people  ca me  in wealt hy, r i ght?   Some people
 ca me  in with thi n gs, ot her  people ca me ... 
A: But the y had to gi ve  e veryt hing a w ay.  
There was a speci al place
.  Je wel r y fir st... 
Q: But did everybody gi
ve everything away? 
A: No, no, you are a bs ol utely ri ght
.  Some pe ople  ca me in
 with some valuables.
  Then they st arte d 
later on i f t h ey nee de d, a nd everybody
 wa s tra di n g s o me  
val u ables for food. 
A: Bertie , we di dn™t  t urn in 
our jewelry until
 the last day. 
Q: But that™ s  what  I mean. 

A: That™s what I j ust sai d.  
That e ve r ybody who had some thi ng c ould bri ng it in bec a use nobody, 
they didn™t have to undress, like 
when they went t o the camp i n 
Auschwitz, they ha
d to completely 
strip a nd everythi ng was  take n a w
a y  fr om the m.  So, natur all y, pe
ople came into 
the ghett o wit h  
whate ver val uabl es t he y had.  But t he y  di d not  hi de. 

Q: Ri ght, but  ther e woul d 
be some  people who might not  ha ve  had anythi ng?  
A: Abs olut el y.  M ost  of t he m.  Be ca use let ™ s not  forg
et  that t here were a lot  
of poor Je ws  in Pola nd. 
Q: Were they more vul nerable?  

A: Vulnerabl e in what sense? 

Q: Well, vulnerable in
 terms of the amount 
of food they would 
get, their inability 
to barter or...? 
A: No.  The y were bett e r equipp
ed t o withstand t hese environments
 t han t he higher cl ass of peopl e 
beca use t he y  wer e poor people .  The y were al wa ys
 in nee d
 for so methi n g so t he y c o uld a djust to

wa s a ver y a f fl ue nt man.  He had e ver ythi ng he wa
nted beca us e  he was a bi g owner of a big fac t or y, 
oka y?   So naturall y, he suffer ed
 much, much more and 
ha d much more t r ouble adj us ting to t hese  
conditions than the 
guy who was poor. 
A: When you see t he pi ct
ure from my we ddi ng, he  
looked like a skeleton. 
A: So also, on the survivor list, 
whe n you l ook a t  the survi vor s t oda
y, I woul d sa y t h
at about 80%  o f  
the sur vivi ng clas s we re poor  pe opl e. 

A: Bert, be careful. 

A: Today, i f  you talk t o t he m, 
ever ybody was a bi g man wit h t heir 
fa ctori es  and had a bi g working 
staff for themselves and everyb od y wa s rich and we  
know t h at they wer e  eaten
 up by the lice.  So  
you find that  the ele me nt ,  or the cl ass of pe opl e wh
o were in t ha t  conditions be for e the war adj usted 
easier to the bad conditions 
in the ghetto than 
the better class of people, if 
we want to classify them.  
Q: Was that true for y
ou?   You didn™t  come  fr
om a  poor  ba ckgr ound. 
Q: Fo r me I wo uld say that sin
ce I became right away in
 an upper position wh
ere I wo uld get a little 
bit more than others I could easier adjust to the co
ndition than most of them 
be cause a s I said I wa s 
in terrific physical condition.  
Bec aus e I was a s p orts ma n all t he way through.  I think that bec aus e 
of my physical condition I 
was able to survive and 
adjust to the conditions. 
Q: In ter ms  of your work, what wa
s t h e harde st t hi ng you ha d t o do?  
A: The har d est t hing I  ha d t o do?
  Th a t  is a 
tough question. 
Q: We  talke d a bout t hat  yeste r da y. 

A: Yes .  

Q: What was it at that t i me t hat 
ma de you sa y, I don™t want t o be 
doi ng this anymore?  Was there a 
speci fic i nci dent  or  was i t  a set of
 inci dent s t hat  ha ppe ne d t o you?  
A: No, the demands which were set forth to the ____
____, t o the depart me nt 
of labor, which I could 
not c o mbi ne  wit h any of my philo
sophy a nd my c haract ers .  And wh
en we actuall y wer e forced t o  
support t he c o mmittee who had t o make list s of deport ations , I just c oul
dn™t dige st that .  And t hat™s  
why, als o wi th the i n flue n

t of that and let my other partner do  
this job.  That was the ti
me I woul d not , I woul d have loved t o ge

in. 

Q: And why do you t hi n g, I 
know t h at Rum-c o f- ski (ph) t hre aten

Why di dn™ t he say t o you, you™ ve got to do it?   This
 is part of the job, you can™t do par t  of the job  

and not the other part of the 
j ob?   Do you have a n y i dea?  
A: No. 

Q: Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-sk
i ( ph) or  just  ot her  hea ds  of depart me nts 
que stioning or t hinking a bout phi

A: I am sure such conditions , such c
onferences and discu

Q: Do you re call a ny s ens e of, 
more theoreti cal conversations? 
A: Certai n occasi ons, yes.  
We could discuss personal  th
i ngs and per sonal  i deas. 
A: When the Rabbi came, he wa s pl aying chess with
 the Ra bbi .  It  was  then
 that they had some 
disc ussi ons.  Be cause Be rt ha d 
a dile mma  you know.  There wa s a

Q: So what did you tal k
 a bout wit h
 t he  Rabbi when you pla ye d ches s?  
A: Various  t hings of wha t  his  e xpe rie nces  beca use  
he  ha d muc h more conta c

not just walk into my office  
beca use  ot he rwis e I  woul d have never  be en abl e t o  do a nyt hing. 
Q: What e xt ent did you feel a s t ool s?  

A: Wh at?  

Q: As tools, used by
 the Germans by how im
possible your situation 
and position, yours and Rum-
cof-ski (ph) and others? 

A: Well , I must sa y tha n k hea ven t ha t  I never ha d 
anythi ng t o deal with the  Ger ma ns .  My dea ling 
was directly with Ru m-cof- ski (ph). 

Q: But in general, they built a certain structure in wh
ich the Jews in the ghetto
 had to do things that 
other wi se  maybe t hey ha d t o do, t he Ger ma ns?  

A: I couldn™t think of anything 
t hey a s ked us t o do what t he y
 s h oul d do be ca use  the y j ust ... 
Q: Well , li ke  the y assi gn people  to
 fac tories  a nd pr oduce  thi ng for t he m?  
A: For themselves, for them personally?  

Q: No, not personal

 of the Reich? 
A: Well , t hat  was  the  pur pos e of our  e xiste nce  in t he ghetto.

A: No, we were just doing what wa
s in that condition, we 
were put in that cond

the Je w i n pr olongi ng our  live s by
 wor king for t he m.  This  doe sn™
t make a n y near  col l aboration. 
Q: No, no t h at™s not what  I mea nt. 
 What I meant is to what extent
 you felt that the Germans force d  
you to be in a position which felt so
 uncomforta bl e as to t he point t o
 sa y to Rum- cof-
ski (ph) , Ok, I  
don™t wa nt t o do that  a nymore. 

A: The Ger ma ns  di d not  pu
t any demands on myself. 
Q: Not per sonally, but  i n general?  
A: The put demands on their own... 
A: The y put de ma nds on the ghett

was Rum- cof-ski  (ph) . 
 Rum- cof-ski (ph) 
and Ya kovobitch ( ph) , t hese t w o pe ople .  These  
two people were the lia
ison people bet wee n the  
ghett o and the Ger ma n ghetto fo- vert ( ph) .  They got 
the de ma nds and the y had t o give t he or ders on 
down to t he other  people  
of what has to be done. 
Q: I mean, one instance of
 it is the Ger mans coul d ha ve sai d, 
we are going into 
the ghetto and we  
are goi ng to take  15
00 healthy people... 
A: They di d it. 

Q: No, I know.  Bu
t t he y also sai d, 
you choose them. 
A: Yes .  

Q: You bring the, you make
 the deportation decision. 
A: First they did.  First they said.  And if the 
de ma nd was not met, then they came in and di d it 

themselves. 

Q: So, one c oul d have  made t he  choi
ce, we™re not  goi ng to do it?   That
 is  a choi ce, that i t could ha ve  
bee n ma de , I  don™t  know what
 t hat  would ha ve  me ant?  
A: Yes.  The result was that they did it themselves . 

Q: There i s a description in t h

But  fr om your desc ripti o n of yoursel v es... 

A: Bert did not refuse. 

Q: You re fus ed and t hen i t sa ys, for

A: Your talking a bout Be rt, he didn™t refus e, he 
just ma ni pulat ed Rum-c o f- ski (ph) be ca use he wa s  
sick.  He couldn™t go sick... 

Q: No, because t here™ s an empt y

ski (ph) and the whol e  
Jewish Counsel and to what ext ent
 was their a d mi ration t hat , yes, 
you s ave d our li ves by givi ng us 
wo rk?  
A: There were I think a much sm
aller percentage of the ghetto 
people who fe lt favorable towards 
Rum- cof-ski  (ph) .  Why, the mas s, 
the bul k of t he  people hate d Ru
m-c o f-s ki (ph) and put hi m i n,  
thought of him in such a 
way that he  was  a de ma gogue , t hat  he 
wa s a t yr ant and t hat he did mea n  
well for the  ghett o.  We know bett er
.  We who sa w ever ything an
d were involved in almost 
ever ythi ng know bett er.  That he 
was the man who really mani pulat ed
 the Ger mans at t hat ti me and 
was able to convince 
them to let us do wh at we  had 
to do so that we can survive. 
Q: So what did he ha ve t o  offe r t hat
 it wa s so valuable to the Ge rmans?  
A: T he work . 
Q: That was so valuable to them? 

A: We ha d t r e mendous t alents .  
Yes ,  we had tale nts i n ever y pha

there is to do.  We  had the

 who want ed t his , ri ght ? 
A: Bebof?  We ll, he felt 
that he  ha s s o methi ng, a force  whic h he can use. 
Q: Ri ght.  So , it was... 

A: An d he wa s able t o 
convince all the leading people to ha

they intend

A: Absolutely, but the only
 thing is that they were able to co

weapons and arm themselves. 
Q: Their work was not t hat val uab

Q: No, the deport ations  a re be for e t he  uprisi ng. 

Q: In 1942, there were 
330,000 people  de port ed. 
A: So t he y c oul d not  sati sfy t he  Ger m ans  as  we could. 

Q: So you t h ink that
 it  wa s the qual ity of t heir  wor k  or?  
A: Probabl y.  Because i f they would have satisfi

have al so be en l e ft alive .  

Q: That™s very i nteresting. 

Q: But, of course, Warsaw is not in the Reich, it™
