Interview with NormanBelfer 
March 1, 2000 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with 
Mr. Norman Belfer, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on March 
first, 2000. This is tape numbe
r one, side A, and th is is
 a follow up interview to a 
videotaped interview that was 
conducted with Mr. Belfer, in
 1995. So , let™s begin by -- 
I™m just going to correct a mistak e, it was -- 
the first interview with Mr. Belfer was done 
on May 31
st
, 1996, on videotape. Okay. I wanted 
to start by asking you a little bit more, 
going back to before the war. 
I wanted to ask you about 
your hometown, Wodzislaw? 
Answer: Yes.  

Q: Is that how you pronounce it? 

A: Yes.  
Q: And I wanted you to say, first of all, so
me thing about your fami
ly™s history in that 
area. 
A: We live in that town, my aunts, and my 
-- not only my  parents, 
my grandparents were 
born there. And we were ver -- respected citi
zens of that town . My  grandfather, and my  
father were running a busin ess, and ev entu a
lly my  brothers helped also, alongside. The 

busin ess was a processing of feathers, and do
wn, which they export
ed from Poland to the 
United States, and -- and several European co
untries. And during the peace time, that 
town was a very small -- I™m not certain 
how many people, but less than 10,000, and

primarily Jewish. And I -- I lived there for my first, let™s say 12
th
 -- 12 years or so. 
Subsequently, I moved to Kraków. 
Q: I -- I™m sorry, I™m going to 
interrupt you a little bit -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- because I don™t want you to feel like you ha
ve to  repeat what yo
u talked about in the 
video. My -- the reason that I asked you ab
out Wodzislaw is that I wondered -- your -- 
your family had a long history in th e town . 
I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a 
sense of connection with the place, if you ev er visited again. Anything mo re about that. 
A: Yes. The only connection about that town 
was that I went back 
to Poland only one 
time. This was a dozen  years ago, mo re or 
less. I think maybe more. There was a first 
march of Holocaust survivors and their 
children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and 
Birkenau, The March of the 
Living. And I -- I was one of
 them, and there were many 
others from United States, and Canada, even  
Australia, South Africa. There were about 
2,000 young people. Co llege -- college or hi
gh school age. And it was a very moving 
experience. There were very -- dignitaries fro
m Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak 
Navonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you k
now, to us about it, and it™s -- was extremely  
moving, and very , very  upsetting, of course
. Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, 
Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, a
nd also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c-
cousins. And we were received by the Polis
h government, extremel
y well. They had all 
kinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate
 building, gave a coup
le parties, you know, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

cocktail parties, where we me
-met Russian ge -- Russian ge
nerals. One of the Russian 
generals spoke Yiddish. And al
so they per -- had a -- performe
d a Jewish show in one of 
their Senate -- what do call them there, Sena
te building, it was a theater there, a theater 
build ing. The show was all done ba -- mo stly in
 -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- 
in the -- in Polish. During intermission, I we
nt over to the person who, I was very 
impressed with her singing. And I ask her ho
w did she learn that, she was quite a young 
person. She says from -- there was a cantor, 
before World War Two 
in Poland, and he -- 
he surviv ed the war, and he had a lot of reco
rds, and she learned it from the records, you 
know. The Polish government gave a special 
reception, because the following day, I 
remember, after   the -- after 
they had that big performance, 
we had -- they invited about 
40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the a
ssistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he 
gave a whole speech about the Jewish people 
should come back to Poland, they  lived 
there for a thousand years, and 
since the Jewish people left -- 
most of them left, they were 
-- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and 
in many other aspect
s, you know, were 
completely eradicated, you 
know. There™s no -- no indust
ry, the -- and they had -- a 
matter of fact, ask everyone wh
at type of profession or business, and wh en I told them 
what my parents used to do, 
say, ﬁWhy don™t you come back, we will build a plant, we™ll 
do th is and that.ﬂ So after he
 gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel, 
Ithzrak Navonne said, ﬁToo little, too late.ﬂ He 
spoke very fluent English. He said, ﬁWhat 
happened ,ﬂ and give all kinds of
 dates, ﬁwhen the Jewish peop
le came back to Poland, as 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
5
 
 
 
 
they came to their hometowns, what happe
ned to them?ﬂ He said, ﬁOh well, it™s a 
different regime.ﬂ He asked, during certain da
tes, you know, so the -- there were all kinds 
of ordinances, you know, and if people came to 
the town, they would 
-- they were either 
shot, or they had to flee town
, because their homes were o
ccupied by Polish people, and 
they didn™t want to -- they fe
lt they may want to reclaim th
eir property. So th ey had to 
flee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mi
ne, he and two other people came back to 
town . Their house was all mo stly demo lished, but
 they  had no place to
 stay, they stayed 
there. So one late afternoon, 
they knocked at the door, and my  friend opened  the door, 
and they  shot him. So th e other two left, you 
know. So my  memo ries about it, is I would 
never want to go back  there again. As a matt
er of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was 
there, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my
 son and my nephew, my  cousins, we -- we 
rented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted 
to the cem -- I didn™t reme mb er where the 
cemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We we
nt to the cemetery, and there was not o-one 
tomb stone [indecipherable] not at all. And th
ere was a -- young kids, who were -- they 
saw a car there, they saw, you know, they 
saw people dressed differently, wh atever. They  
came over and started -- I said -- you know, 
we asked him what about the cem -- what 
happened to the cemeter
y. They were teenagers, actually
. Oh, well they were demolished. 
And they -- you want to see res -- where th
e tombstones are? They
 were -- they made 
walkways out of them, they made stable
s [indecipherable] floors, and so  on.  
Q: You had family, I assume -- you had fa
mily who was buried there, I assume ? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
A: Yes. I had f -- my grandparents were
 buried there, and other relatives.  
Q: Did you -- while you were there, did 
you see any people -- 
any Gentiles you had 
known before the war? 
A: No, but I did meet some pe -- a couple
 who helped -- that couple -- these were 
children of people were -- my  parents and th
ree sisters, and two children were -- were 
hiding fo r a couple months. And th e parents we
re not alive, but I™ve been in touch with 
the daughter of -- and the son-in-law. They ca
me to visit me, to Warsaw, and we met in 
the hotel. Of course, I was very warm to them, 
and I gave them a certain as -- cert-certain 
-- in Poland, it was a substantial amount of m
oney. So  a -- they appreciate it, and they -- 
they do write, send me a Chri
stmas card, or -- or write  to me from time to time. 
Q: You mentioned this family in your first in
terview, and -- and you also mentioned that 
they had -- they had disappoint
ed you and your family by rea
lly not -- by asking for more 
and mo re money when  they were hi
ding, and -- and behaving so mewhat -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- less than honorably. I™m
 wondering how you felt about meeting with th em after the 
war? 
A: I still f -- had a -- I would say a warm f
eeling for them, because 
they did risk their 
lives by help ing, and the money,
 obviously, ha -- we had -- i 
-- if I -- I do remember that, 
we had a manager in one of our plants in
 Kraków, you know, manager who managed the 
feather and down  business. He
 would go ev ery two weeks to the place, and make sure 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
7
 
 
 
 
how -- how my  parents are, and my  -- and th e 
-- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the 
children. And he would give mo ney to that fa
mily for food, and othe
r things, whatever. I 
don™t know how much. My father felt if he 
has a money with him [indecipherab le] the 
money wasn™t so mu ch valuable any mo re, bu
t they would keep some
 jewelry, or some 
gold coin s, or wh atever, just for emergency. He
 was afraid that if he gives it all in one 
time, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she wa
s always so -- they weren™t sure, maybe, he 
would get tired of us. And it became also, ve
ry impossible to live there for a couple of 
months. Was in Novemb er, was ve
ry cold, they were 
in -- actually hidden
 in a bunker, in 
an orchard garden . And two little children, they 
were tall -- they were taught not to speak, 
and not to cry or anything. It
 was quite a horrible scene.  
Q: I had a question about the manager, too, 
who had been  helping out your family. Was 
he non-Jewish? 
A: He was non-Jewish. He was a Christian. He
 worked for us
 for many years, was a very 
loyal person. Bu t right after the war, the Ge
rman put a trustee, you know. They took out 
all the inventory and shipped it to Germany,
 you know. But certain
 materials, they 
wanted to  be processed there, so that ma
nager work ed th ere. He taught them. And 
subsequently , one of my  brothers work ed th ere.
 That -- he felt if he helps them and -- and 
so on, he will survive -- it™ll be
 easier for him to survive 
the war, you know. But it didn™t 
help.

Q: Did you have contact with him after th e war, an-and what was his name, with the 
manager? 
A: [indecipherable]. Yes, but we lost con -- 
he mu st have passed away after. We did write 
to him, and a matter of fact, we -- from -- at 
that time we lived in Italy, and we send him 
packag es, you know, of certain delicacies, you 
know, which was not available in Poland. 
But then we st -- we couldn™
t hear from him. His name wa
s Sh-Sh-Trzyna -- T-r-z-y-n-a. 
I don™t remember the first name. I used to
 call him Mr. Trzyna -- Mr. Trzyna, yeah. 

Q: I™m -- I™m wondering, ob
viously, it was extremely disa
ppointing how little the -- y-y-
you had had -- you men
tioned in your first interview th
at your family had had good 
friends before the war, who were non-Jewish, a
nd that they didn™t, for the most part, help 
during --during the war. 
Q: Didn™t help at all. N one of them help
ed. The only one is that manager wh o tried to 
help as mu ch as he could. And that family
 who were hiding our pa
rents. But they did it 
also for money, because before
 we vacated -- before we knew
 it™s going to be very tragic, 
because we heard wa -- also, there were ve
ry little communications, we had no radio, no 
newspapers, nothing. Couldn™t travel to one vi
llage to the next. But there were rumors 
that -- and there -- some towns, it was very 
-- the Germans came in, and took a lot of 
people out, or most of the Jewish people, be
cause they killed some o
fficer, some soldiers, 
which was just an excuse, you know. But we 
heard all this. My parents arranged to -- 
with these Gentile friends, they
 said, in case of a problem -- 
that w e have a problem, we 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
want to -- we w -- would like to hi -- you to 
help us, we would like to hide there. And 
they gave him a lot -- a lot of silver, and 
anything that was valuable in the house. S-
Special linen, flatware, you kno
w, stuff like this. Whatever 
they could take out, even 
some art. We emptied everythi
ng out. So this was like a co
mp ensation. In addition, we 
made sure we paid them for th
e f-food, and we pay -- also f 
-- whatever else he asked for, 
you know. It -- but still, wi -- I feel with
 all that, he was a decent human being. 
Q: I wanted to ask you, regarding that -- that 
experience of -- of real
 disappointment with 
the fact that these people who 
had been your friends before 
the war, really abandoned you 
and your family, an-and so 
many others. How do you -- 
A: Right. I had school friends, from high school
, you know, in Kraków
, and none of them 
really cont-contacted me, I mean
 even when still wa
s pretty quiet, they
 all stayed away, 
you know? 
Q: How do you -- do you feel trusting now, of
 -- I mean, after having that experience, do 
you feel that -- that as a Jew, you can really
 trust -- as a Jew living 
in America, and as a 
minority --  
A: Yes. 
Q: -- a member of a minority -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- an -- do you feel you can trust 
the majority to do what™s right? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
A: Positively, I wa -- I -- I am -- d efinitely
 would trust -- it™s a 
different system, you 
know, in the United States, it™s
 a democratic system, and ever
y citizen has it™s rights, and 
the Constitution protects every c
it-citizen. S -- but in Poland, 
although the Jewish people 
lived there over a thousand years, as a matte
r of fact, there™s -- 
in that small town, 
Wodzislaw, there™s a synagogue which was ove
r a thousand years old. Bu t during the war 
years, it was -- made a stable out of it, the 
Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so 
on. And everything was destroyed. As a matter
 of fact, I was told it™s being rebuilt now, 
they want to attract tourism, and so on, di
fferent parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish 
people in particular are very, very anti-Se
mitic, and I -- and how ca
n I -- I can explain it 
is, my  own family and I had an experience, 
although we were very
 respected citizens. 
When the Germans came 
in, the first day they came in, 
they knocked at
 every -- they 
were shooting in  front of your house, and th
ere were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so 

on. We were -- we were hiding in a warehous
e that we owned. And finally they came to 
our door, they were steel doors, they were
 banging and shooting, and -- and calling in 
German, ﬁGet out, you [indecipherable] get out
.ﬂ You know, and eventu ally we had to 
get out. They were beating us, 
and we had to run to a square
. And then, they shot several 
people, put some houses on fire. So people 
didn™t come out, they  put them on fire. And 
we are all this -- on that square they [inde
cipherable] on us, several -- maybe it™s couple 
thousand, or several thousand people. Then  th
ey left. So once they  left, my  parents felt 
th-these were the first ones co
ming in, they were -- had tanks
, you know, that we heard. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
So what -- my parents said, ﬁL
et™s go to the church, there™
s a church nearby.ﬂ And we 
were there only minutes, I don™t know, less than
 a half hour. The priest himself, in 
charge, he said, ﬁYou Belfers, you zhid -- yo
u Jews,ﬂ you know, ﬁget out.ﬂ And actually 
pushed us out, you know. Said
, [indecipherable]. So we ran 
to -- we had an  uncle, you 
know, who lived outside -- a l
ittle far out -- outs -- outside 
town. We stayed there for 
overn ight, a couple nights, I don™t reme mb er, a few days, you know. I 
t calmed down, so we went back  to the house. 
We got -- we got no he
lp, really, to speak 
of. Not only that, I know of cas
es who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the 
area, but if a neighbor would know, or fou
nd out, that they being hidden, they  would 
report them, you know? And the people, not only
 the Jewish people got either shot, or 
sent to a concentration camp, or whatever, bu
t also the Gentile. But 
there was no -- there 
were -- the Germans got only cooperati
on from everyone. The church  leaders in 
particular, and it was a bad, bad time, andI can™t explain it even nowaday s, why there 

should be such hate 
in a -- in some people™s mind towa
rds the Jewish people. The Jewish 
people have contributed a lot, not only in -- 
in Poland, everywh -- ev
erywhere they lived, 
in -- in many fields, whether it™s medicine, or 
whether it™s engineering, or -- or -- or so 
many other important fields. But obviously  it 
goes back  so many years, it goes back to -- 

it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that th
ings that we did to Christ, which is a lie, 
and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is 
not very accurate. Even the Pope recently 

stated that. And as far as Jesu
s, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
the Jewish people, he was killed by the Ro
mans. He may have -- 
may have -- he may 
have wanted  to do some reforming, or wh
atever. But why they -- why -- it™s 2,000 years 
later, why is this being taught, or when  -- or 
when  -- that™s why there™s that hate builds 
up, from childhood. They go 
to churches, they™re [indeci
pherable] Jews, or other 
references to Jew, although it has been remo
ved now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu 
-- future generations will not ever have to ex
perience difficulties and obstructions in -- of 
justice and everything, because they have one
 religion, or another religion. I don™t -- I 
don™t believe one religion™s better than the ot
her, they™re all the same, they all teach you 
to be a better person. They don™t teach you to
 hate. And that™s -- th
at™s my message, in a 
way. 
Q: Norman, how did it feel to be back
 in Poland, after all those years? 
A: I™ve -- I™ve f-fell -- I couldn™t sleep nights
, I was so upset, you know. With  all they 

tried to do fo r us, it™s amazing, they even  send
 someone to the hotel,
 one officer of the 
government. He introduced himself, and I had 
met him at the cocktail party. He showed 
me a -- gave me a card, I may have it even, 
I don™t know. He says, ﬁWhy don™t you come 
back to Poland? You bu
ilt the industry. We need you peopl
e, we need more culture, we 
need -- we need help. 
You were born here,ﬂ he says, ﬁI
 understandyou -- 
your parents, 
grandparents, great-grandparents all lived in 
this country. Why do 
-- why don™t you come 
back?ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy no
t come back? They -- everyone
 was killed. None of them 
survived , except my self and two brothers. On
e brother was in America at that time on a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
busin ess trip, and that™s why he never came ba
ck. On ly I and a brother of mine survive. 
And yid,ﬂ I said, ﬁwhat help did we get? Wh
at did we get when  we got back  -- came 
back?ﬂ And so on. ﬁOh, was a different regime
, was dif -- it™s different now. As a matter 
of fact,ﬂ he said, ﬁthat time, you know, we are 
not like in Ru ssia. In Ru ssia,ﬂ he says, ﬁthe 
government dictates w h at the people should
 do, and in  Poland, the gover -- the people 
dictate, not the,ﬂ -- which we all almost la
ughed, they were under Russian regime, and -- 
but we felt, how can they even 
say that, not being afraid to 
say it, but they probably felt 
nobody™s going to go te
ll the Russians what they
 said. But only -- 
Q: What -- what year was this? 

A: I can™t remember. Must be 12 
- 14 years, something like this. 
Q: So, it was before the -- 
A: [indecipherable] the Russian regime wa
s still the ware -- already talking about -- 
maybe a year or two later that -- that broke 
aw ay comp letely, yeah. It could be one year 
later, I™m n o t sure.  

Q: Norman, I wanted to ask you about your -- 
your fami ly, and your siblings, because in 
the first interview you -- you mentioned that 
you had, I believe, f
our sisters, and two 
brothers, but I wondered if you would name 
each one of them, and -- and say what their 

ages were relative to you. And also say specifi
cally what the fate was of each one, just so 
that we have the names conn
ected with -- with a -- with
 what happened to them. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

A: My oldest sister, her name was Bluma, wh
ich is actually in Yiddish, or German, it™s 
flowers, yeah. And she had I think three child
ren -- I™m not po -- I believe three, either 
two or three children, I™m not positive 
any more, and a husb
and. Her husband, 
[indecipherable] was a watchmaker, and he ha
d a lot of friends, Christian friends, too. 
And one day, wh en we heard wh at™s going on,
 he said he -- he made arrangement with 
some good friends of his, next town  maybe 
10 -- 10 -- 12 kilometers from Wodzislaw, to 

the town called Jarlnoveeitz. It -- it -- this
 friend came with a big wagon, and -- and 
horses, you know, in the middle of the ni 
-- one night, and they loaded up s-stuff, 
personal belongings, and so  
on. And while they were tr
aveling out of -- outside 
Wodzislaw, maybe a -- one kilo meter outside 
Wodzidslaw, the German SS, or Gestapo, 
whatever, intercepted them. An
d they shot them all.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: Was that in -- around 1940 - ™41? 

A: Jus -- let  me just thi nk. Th
is mu st have been 1942, right
. When the wa -- it was in the 
fall of ™42, in the fall time, fall season, yeah. 

Q: How much -- how much older was Bluma? 

A: Bluma mu st have been 17 years older than 
I. About 17 years. So I 
-- at that time, in -- 
in 40 -- 40 --™42, I was 19 or 20 years old, yo
u know, tw -- actually I 
-- about 20 years.  
Q: And your next -- the next oldest, after Bluma? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
A: The next oldest is Arthur, my  
brother. He was 16 years older than I. 
Q: And we know what
 happened to him -- 
A: And he went Un ited States -- 

Q: -- he came to the United States. 
A: -- on a business trip, yes. My next one wa
s my sister Mindla -- Mindla, they call her 
Manya, you know, Mindla, yeah . And s -- she 
-- let™s see, was two years, or one year 
younger than Arthur, yeah. I wo
uld say, she mu st have been 
15 years older, or 14. 14 or 
15 years. Then I have a brother Maurice, wh
o survived the war wi 
-- with me. But he -- 
he passed away, unfo rtunately, let™s say about 
-- almo st 20 years ago,
 yeah. He was much 
more affected from the war y ears than I was. He -- his wife and a child, the child was 
only three or four years old, maybe three y
ears old, was in hiding near Kraków, also 
some Christian friends. And one day she we
nt shopping to  -- for groceries, you know, 
with the child. She didn™t lo
ok specifically Jewish, you 
know? She spoke very fluent 
Polish, and all that, lik e -- like a native, of c
ourse. Somebody reported
 to the police while 
she was walking out of the store. They waite
d for her, and shot her right -- right there, 
because she started to cry and protest. Th
e child, we don™t know. There -- there was a 
witness that we met, after th
e war, told us that he was -- 
he didn™t -- he -- he didn™t 
actually see it, but he was in the same town, 
hiding, and he -- he was told that the child 
had just walked away , or wh at
ever. Somebody may have take
n the child, they don™t know 
what happened. I™ve done a lot 
of investigation, we can™t 
find any trace of it. And th e

reason I -- we did so me investigation, in po --
 in Warsaw, there's a h o tel called Belfer. I 
thought, maybe, you never know, you know. 
I -- through the Red Cr
oss, then through 
friends of mine who were in Poland. When I 
was in Poland, I didn™t -- I wasn ™t aware of 
that. May have been built after, w h en I was in
 Poland with that mi
ssion, you know, to 
[indecipherable] I was told by
 the Re-Red Cross 
in a letter, and also by some friends 
subsequently, that the reason the hotel is called 
Belfer, Belfer in poli -- 
in -- i -- they -- in 
school, they called it Belfer like a nickname. Pr
ofessor they called a Belfer. It™s a pension 
fund for teachers, and they ha
ve investment there, and that™s why it™s all -- called Belfer. 
There™s no relationship. I was about to s-s 
-- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister 
called Sheindla, or Sheindo. Schein means 
pretty, beautiful, you know, it™s -- and sh  -- 
she mu st have been eight -- seven or eight ye
ars older than I am -- th an I was. She was a 
very beautiful girl, very, very 
intelligent, and very high mark
s always a s -- in school, she 
always was the top of the class. Then I had 
another si-sister, Helena
, or Hya. She -- she 
mu st have been only two years older than I am
. Two or three, I™m not sure. She also was 
a lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually
 -- what -- what tragic
ally happened to my 
sister s, they -- the three sister s, the y  were in  camp wi-with -- with my
 parents, an-and me, 
and -- and Maurice, in Plaszów -- in Kraków, 
the concentration camp, Plaszów. And after 
being there a year, more or less, th ey were 
-- all the women were taken out. We didn™t 

know where or what. My
 mother, and my sisters. And one 
child of -- of -- of my sister 
Mindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little ch
ild, and she was maybe eight years old, or 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

so. First they took -- there were several hidden
 children, she was one 
of them. First they 
took the children out, then
 the women, we didn™t know 
where, wh at, you know. They 
always would tell you, ﬁOh, they™re going to 
a much better camp, and much easier ts -- 
it™s overcrowded  here.ﬂ They  had all kinds -- 
they had a -- schemes developed to fool y -- 
us. We had not -- we tried to believe, we ha
d no choice, you know? 
But not believing was 
worse. But after the war, when 
we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different 
people in different areas, in different cam
ps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and 
it™s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came 
-- from Italy, I went back to Munich. I heard 
in Munich th ere were big gathering of surv
ivors, you know, from all over Germany, you 
know, Austria. And when I came 
there, I me t some people. And 
they told me 
that they all 
were sent to Au schwitz. But subsequently
, maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a 
woman who was a sis -- a friend of my  younger 
sister H elena, and she said, ﬁI was with 
your three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that 
-- Polish ports, one is German, one is Polish. 

Your sister s were there, and I was there, and 
only days -- ma -- a we
ek or less before the 
Russians came into that section of Poland, th
ey put -- they told th
e people they -- they 
had pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing unif
orms, they told them 
that they going to  be 
exchanged for German prisoner 
of war in Sweden. They gave
 everybody a piece of bread, 
and tried to calm -- this was a way of calmi
ng, you know? Put th em -- loaded them on 
boats, very a -- packed them in
 like in cattle cars, you know, the same way. And th ey say 
going to  Sw eden , but they torp
edoed all the boats. We don™t 
know, there could be 10,000 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
of them. Only about a hundred we
re left to clean up, and th 
-- one of the hundred was that 
friend of my sister, yeah. 
Q: How did you find her, or how did she find you? 

A: In Milan, also, were, at th
at time -- this was almost a 
year after the war, there was a 
place where [indecipherable] where displaced 
people would stay. It 
used to be a -- a 
military pl-place, you know, a caserba, you 
know? And I would -- we already had an 
apartment in  Milan, we -- that we rented, ye ah, my brother and I. So we used to go there, 

daily almost, just -- just me
et some people, see who -- who -- wh at -- always new people 
coming there. Many of them were -- intended to
 go to Israel. Th-They stopped there for 
some reaso n . Also to look fo
r other people. She heard -- sh
e was talking to people that 
the Belfers are here in town, because she met 
some other pe -- so, one day we came there. 
She met us, you know. And she told  us the 
whole story, you know. My mo ther, however, 
did -- did perish in Auschwitz. 

Q: How did you find out about that? 

A: Because that™s -- th at was obvious because 
the -- the trains from Plaszów all went to 
Auschwitz, and they  segregated th e people. 
Young people looked 
fit, they put on one 
side, and my mother that time was a -- in 
the 50™s  -- ma ybe 50 -- 56 or 57, something 
like that.  
Q: So were you sure -- after the war, and y
ou were in Italy, were you sure that your 
mother had perished in Auschwitz? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
19
 
 
 
 
A: Y-Yes, because the whole -- most of 
the women were per-perished -- ya -- only 
young, fitting w-women they kept
. The others were gassed. They
 told them they going to 
get -- have to shower, the delousing, they calle
d it, they give them new clothes, and they  
gas them, yeah.  
Q: I wanted to talk more about that peri
od in -- in Italy, right after the war, and -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So you, at that time -- well, you menti
oned a little bit about that time in your first 
interview, and you mentione
d how you had first gone to 
-- from Salzburg to Modena. 
A: Mo -- yes. 

Q: And I wondered if, in Modena were you living in a DP camp, or -- 

A: In a DP camp. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yes. Also  was -- I emptied out some mili
tary building, and we lived there, yes, for 
about si -- five, six weeks. 

Q: And were you getting help from -- from a
ny organization like the JDC, or -- the Joint 
Distribution -- 

A: UNRRA -- UNRRA. 

Q: UNRRA? 
A: UNRRA would send packag es and so on. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

A: However, I believe I mentioned in the pr
ior tapes, you know -- video -- video tapes, 
while we were there, one American office
r, some -- I could speak some E-English, 
because I studied  English in high school, I -- he
 took an  interest in me. So I told him, you 
know, I have a brother in -- in New Yo rk, but there is no mail, you can™t -- there was no 
mail there, noofficial mail -- 
military mail, where 
they  could help me. He says, ﬁWhat is 
his name, where does he live?ﬂ I say, ﬁI don™
t know.ﬂ My  other brother Maurice was with 
me, he says he -- he -- he used to stay at
 Hotel Broadway in Ne
w York, but he doesn™t 
know wh ere he is now. This officer wrote to Hotel Broadway  in New Yo rk, and asked 

whether or no -- wh ether a name by the -- Ar
thur Belfer, his name was Artur, but he 
changed it to Arthur, you know. So, a letter 
came back, and it -- but -- I wrote the letter, 
and I told him, we are here, we are -- we 
survive, we™re -- and we don™t know whether 
anybody else survived. We -- 
we are afraid to -- I™m afra
id to say that no one else 
survived except me -- I and -- and Maurice. 
And Maurice wrote a few lines. He s -- he 
wired us 500 dollars, to a bank. I didn™t ev
en -- I didn™t even tell him anything. So, the 
bank knew displaced people, 
so they walked around with 
a sign Belfer, sent so mebody 
over. So I went over, and I sp -- couldn™t speak to this guy. I tried 
to speak to him in 

German, I was -- I was fluent in German. He 
couldn™t speak English, I couldn™t spe -- he 
couldn™t speak Polish, he couldn™t speak Hebrew
, so I couldn™t -- so he said -- in Italy, 
they say come, they say like th
is. I didn™t know [indecipherab
le] what it -- what it means. 
Finally he said -- so we went
 to the bank. My brother and I, then we had a few friends 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
21
 
 
 
 
walk with us, too. We went in -- my brot
her and I went into 
the bank. They were 
[indecipherable] waited outside,
 I said, [indecipherable] I di
dn™t know why, but I -- I 
assumed there was someone. So the manager s
poke German. He says, ﬁHebert kinder,ﬂ  
you know. He was very, very 
-- w-we have money for you, 
you know, 500 dollars. Said 
okay. ﬁBut, I ca -- I am not going to  give y
ou the money now, come 
after three o™clock.ﬂ 
So, my brother and I say, ﬁWhy after three 
o™clock, I want the money now.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁLeave it kinder,ﬂ you know, you™re children, 
[inaudible]. ﬁIt™s much better come later. 
I™ll give you now te -- 10 dollars Italian m
oney, you know?ﬂ And 
when we came after 
three, he told us, you know, 
the Black Market is -- no -- is
 a -- a thousand lira per dollar, 
and officially it™s a hundred  lira,
 and he paid us out of the 
Black Market. He saw the way 
we looked , you know. So he ha
d some comp assion, yeah. So after we had all that money, 
we went -- all the -- th e friends, we had [indec
ipherable] we went to a restaurant, and we 
-- they displayed in the window there, looked like chicken, but a-after we bought it and 

start eating it, it was rabbit. We had a -- we 
bought wine and bread. 
We had a big party, 
yeah. We stayed there anothe
r several weeks. They said -- because we -- the reason we 
went to Italy -- I wanted to go to Israel, a
nd they told us then, th
e UN RR A had offices of 
people, you know. People like you who he -- 
look healthy, and young, you mo st likely 
will be intercepted by the British, you know, 
and the -- when you go
 by boat, and they 
send you to Cyprus, because they -- they send
 a lot of people to Cyprus. So my  brother 
and I stay from one camp to another camp. So
 then  we decided we™ll go to Milan. We 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
atch -- actually hitchhiked to 
Milan, because we didn™t 
know where a railroad -- we 
didn™t know any -- couldn™t -- nob
ody understood anything pr -- pr -- 
Q: Before you go into detail about Milan, I ju
st wanted to ask a couple other questions.  
A: Surely. 
Q: What were the conditions lik
e in the DP camp in Modena?  
A: It wasn™t too bad. What we were used to
 wasn™t too bad, you 
-- they had -- you could 
shower there, you could -- they had bathrooms.
 We still were wearing a milit -- the -- the 
-- the British and the American ar
my gave us work  clothes, 
you know. The shirts we were 
-- during the war you didn™t chan ge it for a fe
w years, so can you imagine? There, we 
changed it every two weeks. So, it was a big -- 

Q: A big step up for you? 
A: Yeah. A tremendous sh -- luxu -- luxury. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: By co mp arison. They key -- the Italians we
re -- treated us, I have to say, perfectly 
fine. If you w-went to  Israel, it wouldn™t have 
treated us nicer. They were very -- when I 
lived in -- I fell in love with the Italian peop
le, really. I would have never come here to 
the United States, because my  broth -- my  ol
der brother en couraged  me, he needed me, 
he -- whatever he -- he was sick, and so  on. 
Other that that, I woul
d have never come. We 
had establish a business there and 
so on. So we went to Milan. 
Q: One more question before Milan. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
A: Fine. 
Q: Did -- did you have a -- a passion fo r going to
 Israel, or wh-what wa
s involved in that 
decision? 
A: I had a passion -- a passion to go to  Israel, 
yes. Yeah, I spoke Hebrew that time, and I 
was -- I just felt we were -- we were so brut
alized, and lost everyb -- thing, and every -- 
lost my entire family. We just
 felt -- my brother and I -- but anyway, we came here. But 
w-went to Milan, we a -- we didn™t know wh at -- we had money, we didn™t know where 

to go, we -- we were -- way we were dressed, 
 they probably wouldn™t let us in a decent 
hotel. We slept on th e railroad station. On e of
 -- one of the Italian people, we ask him, 
you know where we can stay, in -- in Ge
rman, you know. Many 
business people in 
Europe spoke German. This -- 
like now, everybody speaks En
glish in Europe, but they 
used to speak German  especi
ally busin ess people, yeah . He
 said why don™t -- the -- he 
said the railroad station were benches covere
d -- had -- covered th-those, if it rains, or 
whatever. The next morning, we
 ga -- went to a public place where you can wash up, and 
shaved. We went out and bough
t clothes, and we called -- my  brother, reme mb ered we 
have some busin ess friends in Milan, Italian 
people. He remembered 
the name, we looked 
up th e name. We called e -- the name was Guardini, and Fachik ani. They  had a lot of -- 

many stores, poultry stores, you know? All ov
er, not only Milan, outside Milan, many 
city -- man y  cities or towns. We
 -- they used to ship
 feathers to us, to Poland. So we call 
up, they  say, ﬁPronto, pronto
.ﬂ I don™t know what [indeci
pherable] even I couldn™t -- I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
said -- I st a rted s-speaking in
 German, they didn™t understa
nd, so I hung up. So my 
brother and I said, ﬁHow do we talk to 
her? Let™s go buy a di
ctionary .ﬂ Bought a 
dictionary , we wrote out padrona, you know, 
going on. ﬁBolea polari con padrona,ﬂ said, 
and yeah -- so we called again, and afa -- 
and I asked for Mr. Guardini, you know, Senor 
Guardini, padrona. He came to the phone, an
d he spoke fluent German. He says, ﬁWhy 
don™t you visit us, please come up, come up fo
r lunch.ﬂ So, we took a taxi, we went up. 
We tal -- he knew what was going on, but 
didn™t know -- we told him about our 
experience. He says -- they took us out for 
lunch, and during lunch th ey said, ﬁW e know 
you have a brother in New Yo
rk, because he was in corresp
ondence before.ﬂ When the 
war broke out, the first year or two, Italy was 
not so aligned later with Germans. So, they 
were in touch from New York -- from -- fro
m Milan, to New Yo rk, you know, these 
people. They said, ﬁYou know, we have a lot of feathers a
nd down  accumu lated.ﬂ During 
the war years you didn™t do any ex porting. ﬁS
o why don™t you take some samples and 
send it to your brother? And 
this way you can make some
 money.ﬂ [indecipherable] I 
said, ﬁBe happy.ﬂ She, ﬁCome 
tomorrow morning [indecipherabl
e] there.ﬂ And ship me -- 
that™s how we started making 
money. Then  we became -- we
 organize a firm, we hired 
some people. Now, we did some processing al
so in Milan. We set up equipment, and we 
bought feathers. We traveled all a -- that™s 
probably what takes me  
out of depression, you 
know, trudigu -- faster. We went to  Czechoslovakia, to -- we went to Hu ngary, 

Yugoslavia we went. We went -- bought as 
mu ch feathers as we could get because there 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
was a shortage in the United St
ates after world -- during the -- World War Two, they used 
up all f-feathers and down, only 
for military use, for sleepi
ng bags. And there was very 
little for public -- for private, yeah, 
people. So a big market for it.  
Q: How did it feel to be traveling in -- in  countries that -- in H-Hungary, or in 

Czechoslo vakia, or Yugoslavia wh ere -- where th
ere had been so mu ch destruction, and -
- 
A: Was just -- we felt -- we want -- you know,
 I wanted to prove to the world, and I -- 
that™s -- that™s probably why I™m -- we are 
-- I™m successful, that we are not stupid 
people, that we have ambitions, and we ha
ve knowledge, and -- and underst -- we have 
intelligence, and whatever -- ever did it in my
 life, after World War 
-- I did only things -- 
not just to make the money, to -- to show 
that I™m a dece nt human being, you know? I™ve 
never -- I -- I ca -- I -- I be frank, I have a bi
g resentment with the Germans. Maybe mo re 
for the Germans than th
e Poles, although the 
Poles were pretty bad, of course. And the 
resentment would have been -- lasted mu ch 
longer if I ever went back  to Po land, you 
know, which [indecipherable] nobody there, or
 any other. The Italians, for some reason, 
were so friendly. You know, 
even when  I couldn™t speak En
glish. I remember the first 
time we asked -- we wanted to  
go to cort -- coursa teachanase, how we go there? The 
Italians would say, ﬁGo straight here, make 
a right turn. Oh no, ma
de a mistake.ﬂ They 
showed us, or they to ok us 
there, you know? They  very , ve
ry friendly. We just -- and I 
had some friends there, eventually. We loved 
Italy, because we were used to deplorable 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
treatment, so anybody who was ni
ce, we found aba -- w-we fell 
in love with them. I had -
- I really lo ved Italy, and we go ther
e every so often. I -- I love Italy. 
Q: What about being in -- 
in Hungary, for example? 
A: We dealt only with the government th
ere. There was no private industry, or 
Yugoslavian. Strictly, you kn
ow, how many pounds do we have
 this, that, they made a 
whole list. We negotiated privately, [indeciph
erable] on this -- you know, this. We had -- 
if we wouldn™t have done this
, I think we would have been 
lost more. I -- we had a one -- 
yeah, brother-in-law who su rvived the war. One 
of my sister™s -- my  sis -- Mindla. And 
he surviv e, and he -- he never was himsel f. H e was such a wonderful, nice guy, brilliant. 
But he was so damaged, he lost two ch ild
ren and a wife, he could never come back. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: His name was Motl, li -- li -- M o tl, like in motel.  
Q: That was his last  name?  

A: Sorry? 

Q: His last name? 
A: Yeah, Finkenstein. Yeah. He
 was a -- he was a broken man, and he was such -- he 
came to visit us in Italy, we 
encouraged  him to s  -- he say that he couldn™t -- he just 
couldn™t function too mu ch. He 
went back to Poland after 
the war, and he -- and from 
him we know for sure, he -- he says, ﬁThe
re™s nobody, nobody.ﬂ 
Eve -- from the same 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
town, only two people 
survived. No, nobody. Be
sides his wife and -- and kids, he lost his 
whole, entire family, no one else surv
iv ed. His brothers, and others.   
A: You were -- so you™re -- you™re in Italy afte
r the war, and you™re just starting to learn -
- I think you said in the first interview that
 you -- you were not aware during the war, of 
Auschwitz. 
A: No, I wasn™t aware of any camp. 

Q: S-So, when you started to learn about what
 had happened, and the scale of the killings 
that -- the murders that had taken place, af
ter the war, do you remember the -- how you 
learned about that, and the eff
ect t h at it had on you then? 
A: You know, I™m not sure whether I unders
tood you, yeah -- will you -- I just was 
thinking of something else. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Could you please repeat it? 

Q: Yes. After the war, when  you were in Ital
y, and you started to 
hear about the camp s, 
and what -- and the -- what had happened th
ere, and how many -- h-how many Jews had 
been murdered -- Jews, and others too, ho -- 
do you reme mber the e
ffect that that news 
had on you when  you 
learned about it? 
A: When I learned about it, I did not know
 about any -- I mean, I learned about camps 
subsequently  there were many, because I went 
back to Munich to look for my -- I thought 
maybe my sister s survived. An
d there were people [indecipherable] some of the camps. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
28
 
 
 
 
We didn™t know there was organized there. 
We thought maybe just this happened here, 
just happened in [indeciphera
ble]. They  were so organize
d, they did town  by town, 
village by village, and there was no communi
cation at all, because peop -- there was no 
radio -- ra -- for ra -- if you had a radio, 
a death sentence, like arms, or radios. No 
newspapers. Didn™t know, didn™t know wh at
™s going on. They  kept many things so 
secretive. T h is way, there was no uprising to 
a degree. If we knew how they --   be more 
uprising, even if we had no arms, nobody he
lped us. Eve -- if anybody had arms, had to -- 
they were afraid to keep th
em, they turned them in, se 
-- except in Warsaw, they had 
uprising, and that™s the only wa -- place. 
Q: So when you -- when you 
s -- after the war, and the information is flowing more 
freely, were you -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- were you shocked, or -- to 
find out what had happen ed, and -- 
A: I was very -- of course, very, very 
-- I was very depressed about it, yeah. 
End of Tape One, Side B 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an
 interview with Norman Belfer. Wer -- were you 
-- did you have mu ch personal contact with people who were coming from the camp s 
while you were in Italy, and -- and was 
-- did you form friendships, for example? 
A: Yes, I did make personal contacts with 
a number of people. Mo st people left -- 
migrated to the United State, to Canada, to 
Australia, to -- even 
some settled in Italy, 
which I still have one particular friend who liv
es in Italy, in Milan, and there may be 

mo re living there, but I™m not f -- f -- I don™
t know them. They  all had to s -- ma ke a 
living, so they all looked for 
jobs, they looked for some prof
ession, and some even went 
back to school. I knew a doctor, and -- in 
Great Neck, New York  where we live, part 
time, who went to -- became a medical -- wh
o became a physician, went to medical 
school in Italy. I knew an engi
neer, very brilliant guy, he™s de
ceased now, and he went to 
engineering school in Munich. So there are 
-- these are only a few individuals that I 
know. 

Q: And did you talk together 
about what had happened  during the war, or did -- were you 
more focused on
 the future? 
A: We talked, but very little. We -- we -- we 
would say where we were, what we lost. We 
-- we didn™t -- it was to o painful, still, to talk
, you know? As a matter
 of fact, my  brother 
Maurice, who lo st a wife and -- and a child, 
he remarried, you know, in Milan. And he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
never told  his wife, and the -- all -- and his ch
ildren, that he lo -- he had a wife before, 
and a child thas -- because it was 
too painful to 
talk about it. 
Q: He never told them? 
A: Never told them. How I know is, after he 
passed away, I wa -- I was discussing it. He 
may have told her that he had a wife, and a 
child, but the children, 
you know, they™re in 
their 20™s, didn™t know. He wouldn™t talk about
 his experiences. Was too painfu l to him. 
My children, I did tell, over the years, yes.
 Little by little, yeah. They ask questions. But 
he never told his children. He
 -- if the children would ask him, he would say, ﬁI don™t 
want to talk about it, 
it™s too painful for me.ﬂ 
Q: That must have been -- 

A: I think since ﬁSchindler™s 
List,ﬂ -- you know, that movie, 
a lot of survivors, for some 
reason, that I -- that I k n ow, you know, in 
the -- in New York  area, have been talking 

mo re openly, for some reason. I don™t know
, I mean it™s -- many years past, obviously, 
from ™45 to now, you know? It™s 55 years. Bu
t people in the last fe
w years, you see, are 
more -- talk  more about it. 
Q: Are -- is it important to you to have frie
ndships with su rvivors, people who have been 
through something similar to
 what you™ve been through? 
A: Only  some, obviously. Not too many. Cause the 
area we lived weren™t any,  really to -
- that I know of.  
Q: In Great Neck?

A: In Great Neck. Th -- if there were any,
 I didn™t know. In New York I had -- in New 
York  City, you have Brooklyn, and you kn
ow, the Bronx there was some people. And 
especially I got to know them
 after -- in the last 20 year
s, Yad Vashem became very 
active, and I™m one of the -- I™m the inte
rnational vice-ch airman of Yad Vash em.  
Q: I want to hear more ab
out your work with Yad Vashem, and -- and th e mu seum, but 
first -- may b e we should do that a little later -- 
A: Surely. 

Q: -- and -- and stay with -- I wanted to as
k about Maurice™s -- you mentioned in the first 
interview that Maurice married in Italy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And he married a German woman? 
A: She was German Jewish, yes. 
Q: German Jewish, Okay. 

A: Yes. Actually more in the -- more Fren
ch than German, she 
c-came from a town, S-
Sowerbriken. I don™t know the English way of -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: It™s on German- French bor
der. She spoke French and Germ
an, and Italy -- and Italian, 
yeah. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
Q: And also, regarding -- you mentioned a littleearlier that -- that you™ve -- that it™s been 
difficult for you to forgive the 
German people, or that you 
-- you don™t want to forgiv e 
them. Have you had to -- in your business, have
 you had to deal with
 Germans, or is -- 
A: I never wanted to deal with them. 

Q: And y-you haven™t ha
d -- had to do that? 
A: As a matter of fact, one time si -- I was bu
ilding a major project in New Jersey, on the 
Palisades, and I was working 
-- Citibank was my  sub -- bank,
 and one of the officers 
from Citibank said, ﬁThere™s some Germans 
who would be very much interested in 
buying your project or become part of this.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁTell them th
at I would never deal 
with Germans because of my background.ﬂ I -- just simply
 not -- and the same -- Arabs 
approach me, over the years, I don™t want to 
do any business. It™s not just making money, 
it™s -- I wouldn™t just sell myse
lf because to make money, you know? I™m still very hurt 
about it, obviously, but I -- I -- I try -- I don™
t think about it, I try not
 to. I™m a v ery, very 
disciplined person, you know. I ha -- I learned 
how -- things that are not important, I -- I 
never think about it. I try to get it out of my
 mind. Otherwise I couldn™t -- I couldn™t live 
properly, I was -- as -- or do anything the ri
 -- you know? If you™re filled with all kinds of 
emotions, you couldn™t make decisions, you 
couldn™t be successful in any type of 
profession or -- or business, or 
-- or teaching, or whatev er.  
Q: When you were in Italy, did y
ou travel around 
much in Italy -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
Q: -- were you interested in the culture? 
A: Yes, I -- I -- I remember the first time
 I went to Rome. And we went -- with my 
brother, Maurice, and we went
 to the Vatican, and was so 
impressed with th e grandeur, 
with all the -- the art, and everything so  impr
essive. Very imp -- I was -- had a -- I never 
expected this to be so -- so interesting, 
and when I wa-walked out, there were mothers 
with little -- with children, begging for a pen
ny, you know? That I c
ouldn™t stand to see, 
the richness of the Vatican, all -- even gold 
jewelry, and all this, an d couldn™t support 
these poor mo thers, you know? And you saw two,
 three year olds, five years olds running 
around on that square, and so
me would tr -- even had maybe
 10 year old boys, or maybe 
12, they  were selling pornographic pictur
es, you know? I tr [indecipherable] I -- I 
couldn™t understand that. But we also trav
eled you know, and I loved Floren ce, and 
Venice very  much, and also some [indecipher
able] you know. Shallite, and I like Kromo, 
near the Swiss border, you know? That beau tif
ul hotel there, and Straza, and Terrona. I 
know a lot of it. And southern Italy, there.
 I knew Ispia, and Capr
i, and Naples. I-I -- I 
made a point, the first few years, you know, 
the fir -- after a couple years I said to my  
brother, ﬁY -- we have enough money now to 
-- we don™t have to work  so hard . Now, 
let™s do some traveling, and so on.ﬂ And we di
dn™t have a lot of money, but to us it was a 
-- a lot. We had 10,000 dollars, we -- we we
re millionaires in Italian liras, you know? 
10,000 dollar was like 10 million liras, you kno
w? So -- so [indecipherable]. So we 
traveled a lot. We had a -- made a lot of ni
ce friends, some Italians, and non-Italian.

Q: Did you practice Judaism at all? 
A: Did I what? 
Q: Did you -- did you prac
tice Judaism at all? Did you go to synagogue? 
A: Not really. Not really at all. Not at all.  Also, I be -- I was inte
rested, and during high 
holidays I would go to a temple there. It 
was like a Reform temple. But I -- I was angry 
about this whole thing, you know, other re
ligions. It -- however, it™s -- you get older and 
older, you start thinking maybe -- I don™t unders
tand, I can™t explain it, but where is God? 
Why have you puni
shed? And so on. 
Q: Y -- we didn™t hear anything about your  
religion, or your religious education before 
the war. I know that your father was Orthod
ox, but were -- did you have any natural 
inclination or interest in -- in
 religious issues, or -- or natural faith as a -- as a young man? 
A: Yes, I was -- as a young man, I was very 
-- I would say very observant. But I was not 
a f -- never was a fanatic, you know. Neither wa s my  father, he was a very Orth odox, but 

he was -- he di -- but he was active in the bus
iness world, and so on.
 But I went to Yesh-
Yeshiva, you know, before -- 
til ma -- maybe I was 13 years 
old, you know? And then I 
went to Hebrew high school. That™s where 
I learned spa -- I knew -- I knew Hebrew, but I 
didn™t know it was a spoken language [indeci
pherable]. My family all were very learned 
you know, and very broad mind
ed. And I mu st have had a ve
ry strong background, or 
whatever. They gave me
 a lot of -- they brought me up 
right, obviously. I love people, I 
trust people, I -- I can read people. Maybe th
at developed a little [indecipherable] too. I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

can read who is sensi, who isn™
t, you know? I lo -- now I say I 
lost a little bit of it, but I -- 
I don™t, know, I can read pe
ople. It™s amazing how well. 
Q: You think th at you could do th
at during the war, as well, or -- 
A: Oh, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. Do you think that
 helped you to surv ive? 
A: Must have, yes. I always kept a strai
ght face, I don™t know [indecipherable] such 
horrible things, I would not -- some people got ve
ry upset, and they w
ould be part of that 
they were -- they didn™t survive after th
at, you know? They would cry and scream, or 
whatever. You had to be made of iron. 
Q: Can you say something mo re about -- abou
t the -- about your religion now, a -- your 
faith now? It sounded li
ke y -- it™s developed. 
A: I am -- I am, I would say, 
Conservative. In other wo rds,
 I go to temp le only on high 
holid ays, and also when I have -- you 
know, Yahrtzeit, what -- what it means? 
Q: Remembrance? 
A: Where you go -- yeah -- you -- we -- we
 approximate our dates when  I lost my  
parents, then I go to temple, or my sister
s [inaudible]. The one th -- there™s a date, and 
they -- it™s a memori
al day for that person, whatever, 
I would go. Otherwise, I don™t go. 
What I found interesting, I don™t know, very fe
w people know th at, wh
en I lived in Italy, 
I had a girlfriend. Her fa -- I met her fath
er, the father was Jewish, the mother was 
Gentile. And she was a lovely girl. She told
 me she™s Christian because her mother™s 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
36
 
 
 
 
Christian, and her brothers ar
e Je wish, because the father is
 Jewish. It™s -- it™s the only 
place I™ve heard of is in Italy, yeah. They
 will go to church, a
ll of them, let™s say 
Christmas, and high holi -- Jewi
sh high holidays all 
go to temple, to s
ynagogue. That™s -- 
and -- and it was very, very normal there, it w a
sn™t -- there were a nu
mber of families like 
this. I™ve never heard of it in any other place. 
Q: Does that -- how do you
 feel about that now?  
A: I think -- I think it™s better than hating e
ach other. It™s a very good compromise, its™ a 
very good compro
mise. Because very often I hear yo
u intermarry, and when something 
goes wrong, they right away pick  on religion,
 yeah. They don™t blame, because he -- you 
don™t -- well I don™t focus on -- on it, you don™t  understand it, but I -- people get angry. 

[indecipherable] call you -- you™re a Jew, or yo
u™re this, or you™re that, you know? Had 
nothing to do with the 
religion. What I was in -- what 
amazed me a bi -- the reason I 
loved Italy so much, there was no -- I couldn™t
 feel any anti-Semitism, none whatsoever. I 
told people, they ask me, yeah
, I say -- I™m a -- a brayer who is Jewish, you know. Some 
even -- I had some Christian frien ds that we 
made over the years. I met them d u ring -- in 
the hotel, you know, wh en you™re
 on vacation, became friendly.
 So they ask me one time, 
ﬁWhere you going for Christma
s night, where you going? Wh
ich church do you go to?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI told you I™m -- I™m a -- a brayer, I™m
 Jewish.ﬂ He said, ﬁY
ou™re Jewish? But you 
poli -- you come from Poland.ﬂ Th
ey don™t understand. Poland 
all Christians. I say, ﬁYes, 
but there were some Jews there.ﬂ And they d
on™t -- didn™t matter at all. [indecipherable]

years after. As a matter of fact I have one g
uy who™ve send me a present last ti -- last 
year. We exchange presents occasionally. Sent 
some shirts with the 
name Belfer. There™s 
a comp any, you know, in Italy, they make very
 fancy sp orts clothes, 
and he sent my  wife 
and me shirts with Belfer and Belfer, printed 
in, some logo. So he found it in a store in 
Milan, so he felt he has to send it to me. We™r
e going to see him this summer, too. It™s -- 
th-th-the Catholic church actua
lly is the major -- all of th e 
maj -- the major, the pope, and 
all the cardinals, and all this, all operate
 from Rome. And I couldn™t understand why 
there™s so little anti-Sem
itism in -- in Italy, and so much 
in -- in other parts of the, in 
Europe. I couldn™t understand that. They  were
n™t preaching it, maybe, at their home base. 
Q: Di -- have you had any -- 
how do you feel about Catho
licism in general, I mean, 
having lived in a Catholic co
untry, do you think that -- 
that most Catholics are anti-
Semitic, an d it was just the Italian s who weren™t, or -- 

A: It™s -- it goes by country , so it™s almo st
 -- like Czechoslovakia let say, I know it from 
people that I knew, and I traveled after th
e war to Czechoslovakia. There was no -- not 
quarter as much anti-Se-Semitis
m as in Poland. Maybe because
 in Poland, there were -- 
the Jews were there longer, for over a thousand 
years, and th ere were mo re Jews there. I 
don™t -- we don™t know. And also, they were 
less educated. The Poles were not very well 
-- there were many illiterates, it -- maybe than ot
her countries. But see, let™s -- but at the 
same time, look at the German
s, very -- they™re very -- th e most educated people in 
Europe, they were, and what th
ey did, you know. They did it,
 I think, because the whole 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

world, nobody actually protested, nobody came
 to help. All -- by -- by being silent is like 
acquiescing. And some even help ed . Like a small country like Denmark, they told them 
the -- you know, to wear -- th e Germans told them to wear
 these Star of David, you 
know, on their clothes, or whatever. They sa
id no til the king himself put it on. And more 
s -- mo re over Bulg aria was a country wh ere 
they told  the Germans, ﬁIf you co  -- if you 
take one of our citizens out, there™s a war.ﬂ Th
ey never went in. Othe
r countries let them 
in. And the worst, I feel, was Hungary, you
 know. They were o
ccupy -- the Russians 
occupied mo st of Po land, all Poland. They  we
re close to their borders, they were -- still 
was -- only a few weeks before the war, the 
entire war was over, they were still sending 
people in April. The war was over, let™s say, 
in some parts was over already, they were 
sending Jewish people to Auschwitz. I 
mean, that™s unheard of. They just 
[indecipherable] us. It™s -- it™s 
painful to th ink about it. Why would you do that to another 
human being?  

Q: I wanted to ask you, you had, as a young
 man, your education had been in terrupted. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you -- 
A: I never finished high school. 

Q: Did you ever have th e desire to -- to go 
back to school, to continue your ed u -- your 
education, or did you ever do th at? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

A: I did go -- I di -- I h ad private tutoring in 
Milan, you know, especially wanted to learn 
Italian. I also started -- took
 some business courses, and when I came to the U.S., I went 
to -- I became interested in real estate
, you know. I -- I attended NYU, New York  
Univ ersity, you know, has cla
sses for j -- for drawings, and 
construction methods, and so 
on. And -- and also American hi
story. I took courses night -- at
 night. That™s -- and I self 
educated myself. I -- I read as 
-- I -- when I have free time, I 
read, about everything that™s 
going on, you know. The New York
 Times specifically, I read 
from all cover to cover, in 
a way. And my wife is very -- she™s very 
intellectual. As a matter of fact, she is a 
founding chairman of Fellowship of Ch ristia
n Jews, in Palm Beach. She been the f -- 
she™s a -- she can -- this organization™s only 
ab out maybe six, seven years old, you know. 
She™s on the board, and [indecipherable]. An
d Palm Beach itself was very anti-Semitic y-
years ago, but it much, much, mu
ch less now. We have -- once a year, we have a big ball, 
you know, and [indecipherable] the Breaker™s
 Hotel, where many Christian Jews come, 

sit at the same tables. In -- in general, the 
-- th e atmosphere is mu
ch, much better than it 
used to be there, because we have a dialog, 
they see we are not different than they are, 
really. We have -- here, we have a number of 
very Christian friends, very lovely people. I 
hope they  think of us as mu ch as [indeciph
erable] very lovely. I -- I don™t know, that™s 
why I can never understand the hate it build
 up. That -- that put a -- it bothers me, 
because if you™re not going to be aware of it, lik
e in history, if you™re not aware of it, it™s 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

doomed to repeat itself. In ot
her wo rds, if you don™t learn 
from the history. So  you have 
to try to correct whatever is possible. 
Q: Maybe we should talk abou
t how you came to the United 
States. Do you want to say 
something about that? 
A: Surely . My brother Arthur 
would come to Milan, Italy be
cause we lived there, and he 
wanted to buy more and more feathers, so 
he came every -- every year for awhile, see 
what we doing. And we had -- we were we
ll established, and he was on th e -- on a 
weekend, he went to the Lido Hotel in Long 
Beach -- Long Island, 
you know, he would -- 
he would go there always in the summertime,
 he and his family. He was swimming, and 
the undercurrent, he almo st drowned. He, and 
a couple of other people, I -- I believe one 
of them drowned, or -- or two, I™m not sure
, really. And he -- they operated on him be-
because he had the lung 
-- they had to cut part of one of 
lung off -- he was -- so he asked 
me to come, he wasn™t doing we
ll. Took awhile to get all 
better. I couldn™t refuse, so 
that™s how I came. I didn™t like it, really. I went
 back a few times, just for a short time, to 
visit my  other brother. And finally I met El
eanor, see. And when I met her, so  -- of 
course, we got engaged, and awhile later, and th
en we got married, so 
they went to Italy, 
and I stayed there. We stayed there for five
 weeks, my  brother was calling me after two 
weeks, when are you coming back? 
Q: So he really needed you? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
A: Yes. When are you coming ba
ck? So we star -- I he -- 
you know, that time, Eleanor 
[indecipherable] her parents heard that you going 
to Italy, going to  Italy, and I™d say that 
they were not very so phisti
cated a b out Europe, you know
. Oh. They said, ﬁWhy would 
you go to  Italy, so many places in the United 
States.ﬂ I said, ﬁI lik
e it.ﬂ But Eleanor loved 
it, too. I was considering staying back in It aly, coming back. Bu t I had s -- a feeling for 
my brother, and we got married, a
nd I -- we settled here, you know. 
Q: Can you say something mo re about why y
ou didn™t like the Un ited States, or why it 
didn™t appeal to you as mu ch as Italy? 
A: First off, when I arrived at the piers in 
New York, the screaming, and the yelling, and 
the taxi drivers. You have to wait to get a ta
xi, everybody was trying to get taxis. And the 
noise, and the overhead  west side highway, 
you know? And there were
 so ma ny people in 
the streets, and all types of people, and I just
 took me -- took me tim
e to get used to it, 
simple as that. Not I didn™t like it, but I 
-- I didn™t like the food, either. However, my 
brother and his family took me out to a steak 
house, they gave us steak for three people, 
you know? I reme mb er [indecipher
able] I couldn™t -- I wasn™t used
 to this type of food, I 
liked Italian food. And little things, nothing. 
Once I learned more about th-this -- the 
American system in amer -- and the way th ings 
are done here, I started to love it. It took 
me -- it took me a short time, it took a couple of
 years. Then I became mo re used to it, 
you know. I love it now.
 I™m very proud to be an Ameri
can citizen [indecipherable]. I do 

anything that is proper there to any citizen, I don™t care whether they™re -- or what color  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
or what religion  I-I™m not this
 way. As a matter of fact, wh
en I came am -- to the United 
States, I never saw Black children. Where -- I could see Black people aft-after the war, 
because in Poland, neve
r -- I never saw a Black person, neve
r. In Italy, you see th -- I saw 
some, and Germany, cause soldiers, you know 
still were after the war. But I never saw a 
child, or a woman. A woman I 
saw, only in a film, where 
that -- the, ﬁGone With the 
Wind,ﬂ had that -- I remember 
distinctly. I used to go to 
English movies in Milan, I 
wanted to  improve my -- my  English. So I 
ha -- I -- I had no prejud
ices. I mean, that™s 
how I was raised, obviously
, it comes from childhood.  
Q: When did you become a citizen? 

A: I became a citizen in -- let™s see -- in ™52, 
I believe, 1952. I believe you have to be -- if 
you™re married to a -- an American citizen, I 
believe after two years -- is it two or three 
years, I™m not sure, you become -- I got a pass
port, yeah. And if you are not a -- if you™re 
not married to an American, it™s -- takes fi
ve years to get a c
itizenship papers.  
Q: And by that point, 
did you feel very lo
yal to this cou --  
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: -- or really interested in this -- 
A: There™s certain things I didn™t like. 
People were -- some people were -- I find 

European people -- and I™m talking about Ital
y, I cannot -- I cannot speak about Poland.

A: Their behavior -- the behavior was mo re refi
ned in Europe than in the United States. It 
may have ch ange now, you know. Matter of f
act, American used to  dress differently, you 
know. In Dearborn, I -- I remember, I had th
e custom made suit for coming to America. I 
thought I want to look prope
r, you know? And they -- the fi
rst thing my  brother says, 
ﬁYou look like a greener.ﬂ 
You know what a greener? 
Q: Like a greenhorn? 

A: Greenhorn. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And this American says, ﬁWhy don™t you 
come and buy so me suits?ﬂ He wanted to go 
-- this was around the year end. So he wanted
 to go a hotel in the Catskills, he says, 
ﬁPeople don™t dress like this.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay, 
let™s go.ﬂ I tried on -- ev erything was so big 
-- I™m sorry -- big, and -- I d -- 
as -- I couldn™t find an-anyth
ing, but that -- so I bought 
some -- one suit, but I don™t want to buy any 
more. But also ties, at that time they were 
big ties, and very  loud. I was not used to it, 
so -- anyway. But I feel 
in the United States, 
you don™t have this -- you still 
have some resentment, and -- but it™s more civilized. It™s a 
ver -- if there is a resentment -- in Europe
 th ey were all open, you know, and -- and I 
continued, it™s -- it was a continuous proble
m, you know, whether you™re Jewish, or non-
Jewish, German, or Italian, or this. Even 
then -- between nations, 
they were hating each 
other. That™s why th ey had wars every -- ever
y 25 years, or twen -- every -- a new war.

Q: I wanted to ask you just a little bit more about Israel, or wa -- Palestine, wa --  your 
plans to go, and did -- was it difficult to disc 
-- to change your mind about that, or did -- 
how did -- how did your -- how did that desire to go -- 
A: I definitely intended to go
, I definitely wanted to go ther
e, and so did my  brother. We 
felt that we have been  abused, an d -- and mu rd
ered, you know, and we 
just wanted to be 
in a Jewish state, you know? It was not a stat
e yet, but we hoped. 
We will fight, we were 
ready to fight, and do anythi
ng, to have a -- a sovereign Je
wish state,  because we felt 
then, and now, if we had a Jewish state, th
is would have never ha
ppened. Maybe people 
would have been killed, but not by the -- by 
the millions. Nobody 
he -- you know, even 
the United States, th-they could have helped
, they didn™t help. None of the European  
countries helped, and -- nobody
 helped us. And nobody gave 
us weapons. If anybody had 
weapons, had to turn them in, 
in the beginning, you know? Th
e first two years, you hear 
they would shoot somebody, or
 put you in jail for nothing, [indecipherable], but then 

gradually became harder and harder. They fo
oled you in such a way. Very little was 
known, what was going on. And ev en the best
 of your neighbors, some of them, they 
want -- if they, let™s say, wanted to help, were
 afraid to help, see? 
But they™re very few. 
As a matter of fact, I w as in -- at Y ad Vash em, it™s going to be two years in j -- th is Ju-

June, yeah , where [indecipherable] the 50
th
 anniversary of the state of Israel. I believe 
that™s when it -- yes, ™4 8, yeah. Yad Vashem
 invited 60 families fro
m Europe who helped 
-- Righteous Gentile, you know?

Q: You mentioned -- we were talking 
a little bit about -- 
about Israel -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: Is there anything else you want to say 
about that? Maybe w-was it -- have you always 
followed closely the -- the political situation th
ere? For example, when the sic -- six day 
war came along in -- in 1967, was that an 
-- was than an importa
nt event for you? 
A: It was extremely important, because we -- 
we felt -- I felt that th ey liberated the land 
that th-the -- that the Arabs felt is their land,
 but if you go back in history, a lot of it 
belonged to Israel. And even now, the disput
e about the Gaza Strip, and other areas, you 
know, that belong to Israel, but Israel is not a 
state. It™s P alestine, an d -- there™s a conflict, 
of course, and I hope they -- they will have a 
peace tre-treaty, and try to live together, and 
they™ll be much better off by -- th
ey don™t have to love each ot
her, but at least they should 
co-exist. By co-existing, the Arabs would defin
itely benefit, and I think ev en Israel would 

benefit, having peace, not have to arm itself
, and lose people, you know, and -- which is 
completely a waste of human life. They can -- but
 what is -- what is ba
d in -- in -- in -- in 
these Arab countries, like Sa
udi Arabia has all the money, and other, and Iran, and all 
this, they all -- they hate each 
other to -- they don™t hate only Israel, they hate each other. 
Iraq, you know? They depresse
d -- they oppressed the people, 
and they live like -- all the 
leaders in these countries li-liv
e like kings. You see them 
when you go to Europe, in 
some hotels, I™ve met some -- I w as in Switzer
land maybe 10 years ago. They  take entire 
floors, they come with a whole crew, you k
now, they all -- a cook, and help, and wh at 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
they love mo st, I™ve seen, th
ey go to gamb ling casinos. They
 gamble maybe thousands, or 
millions, who knows? They just
 -- the disgrace of their ownpeople; instead of building 
them up, they build themselv
es up, the leaders themselves. It™s unfortunate. Also the 
market, let™s say, the Arab -- because of the 
standard of living there, their wages are so 
low by co mp arison to  Israel, or by com -- comp
arison to  European™s standards. And even  
s -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or 
any of these countries, exporting a lot of 
goods to the United States, b
ecause their lab o r is extremely -- 10 cents an hour. In the 
Arab countries some ma -- don™t make mo re, 
they™re making less. 
They  could build up 
their economies, like Japan did 
after World War two, and othe
rs, with the help of the 
Israelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting,
 not even  knowing what their -- they want, 
and every [indecipherable] they make, they
 don™t live up to, you know, it™s -- it™s a 
constant problem. I hope th
e new generation will understand that better, be more 
educated, mo re broadminded, and there™ll be 
peace in that area, and by having peace in 
that area, will be peace also 
in many other areas, because we
 are interrelated in a way, 
one co untry with a -- with another. I hope th -- Ira
q, in particular, and Iran, th at they have 
some new governments, you know, which aremo re for the people, not fo r themselves. 
Q: When did you first travel to Israel? 

A: I went to Israel, I -- I believe the first time
 in -- in the late 50™s,
 early six -- yeah, 1960 
I know I was there, you know, 1960 [indecipher
able]. That was a time which was very 
unusual. That -- Adolf Eichmann, at that time,
 when we were in Israel, was brought from 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
Argentina, or wh atever, and was a big, big celeb
ration, in a way. Sort of tragic, but -- that 
they caught him and brought him 
to justice. And I was -- the streets were full of people, 
and s -- and was so much excite
ment about it. Was very -- I wa -- we were very happy to 
be there, to be -- to 
have been there, yeah. 
Q: Did you follow the trials 
closely, the Eichmann trials? 
A: To a degree, yes, yes I have, definitely. As
 a matter o f fact, we w ere in Israel the two 
years ago, I started to tell you ab out the 
-- I don™t know whether I finished it. Yad 
Vashem invited 60 families fro
m Europe. These 60 fa
milies, whose -- who were -- helped 
Jews, they didn™t have to be the -- they co
uld have been ch ildren,
 or grandchildren of 
them, the whole families were invited for the 
-- they were put up in
 the Hilton Hotel, a 
very fine hotel. Made big 
dinners, and we were -- the 
big ceremony at Yad Vashem, and 
the many -- there were dignitaries from diffe
rent countries, and -- and th ere was a 
discussion, one of the speaker
s said, I™m -- I™m not sure wh
ether it was Netanyahu, or 
somebody else, during the war, World War tw o,
 there were 400 million people in -- in 
Europe, and how many do you think -- Gentile
s -- helped Jewish people? Under 14,000. 
A fraction of -- less th an one -- a fraction of one
 percent, you know. In
 other words, that™s 
--   that tells a lot. The people who -- who 
were invited, were given sp ecial medals, like 
[indecipherable]. They were treated royally, th
ey were invited to th
e -- to the president™s 
house, and that really -- they -- they were 
so -- so amazed, and some of them say they 
want to come and s -- and retire there. They
 were so -- so amazed, yeah. Yes, what I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
wanted to say, we met yes -- we met an elde
rly lady wi-with her son, from Holland. No -- 
not -- not from Holland, from Austria. She wa s put in a camp in Auschwitz. She was a 
German physician -- Austrian physician who he
lped Jewish people -- or Jewish friends, 
you know? She helped them, so
mething, she was put in -- 
into Auschwitz. And she said 
that she worked under Mengel
e, you know? And he ex perime
nted with human lives, and 
so on. He gave   and she was supposed to gi ve him certain pills to take, you know, make 

sure that they swallow, and 
so on. A lot of them she did 
not distribute, she di -- she 
disposed of it, you know, she -- and so on. Cert
ainly she -- and she even said wh at -- what 
the drugs were, certain drugs. 
She was a very elderly, and sh
e wasn™t in good health, she 
was wearing a -- sh -- with crutches, you know
. But her son was very  intelligent. Nice 
man. And he explained the whole -- what me
ng -- wh at Mengele, what he did to the 
prisoners, you know. He kept them out nude in
 that na -- in the -- in the freezing weather, 
to try -- how much you can stand. There all ki
nd of ex periments. Whatever sh e could help 
avoiding, she would -- she was risking her own lif
e, but she said she couldn™t say one hu -
- why one human being could do 
this to another. And many of 
these Christians who were 
invited, they  were very loving people. They  
say wh at they did to 
-- to you. They call us 
brother, and you know, they said
 -- they even said, you know
 -- I remember he said, we 
are brethren, beca -- we -- we believe in Jesu
s, and Jesus was a Jew. They even brought 
up, why would I hate the Jews, you know?
 He actually -- th
e Jews with the 10 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
49
 
 
 
 
commandments, all kinds. We tried -- they trie
d to explain their reasoning, tried to find 
why would this happen. It™s 
-- this was quite interesti
ng, and moving, of course.  
Q: Maybe this would be a good time for you to
 talk mo re about your role with Yad 
Vashem, and -- and with the US 
Holocaust Museum, and how you -- 
A: What -- yeah. 
Q: -- how you became invo
lved with helping. 
A: I -- I couldn™t hear the last. 

Q: How you became involved with
 helping to develop these -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- organizations. 

A: I ha -- I have some friends in New York
, and this happened, 
I mean, 30 years ago. 
They said, you know, the Yad 
Vashem -- they built -- the government actually supporting 
it. But Israel at that time was not in finan 
-- well, not in very good financial status, and 
they wanted  foreigners who have some m
eans, to help, and w 
-- they formed an 
organization New York , and I was 
invited to come and -- and 
I took an active role in -- 
you know, at meetings and so 
on, and I became a vice-chairman
. Also went to Israel, and 
to the museum on many occasions, to have 
meetings there s -- and that™s how I got 
involved. And once a year we 
have a meeting in -- in New 
York, where there are over a 
thou -- 1200 people show up,you know. More, on account of
 it™s -- the -- this is the 
largest room in New York, 
the Hilton Hotel, it™ s -- th at
 can accommodate up to 1200 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
50
 
 
 
 
people, otherwise there would be more. It™s
 n o t only survivors, many Americans will 
come there, and I™m -- I™m activ
e in that organization, I™m active in many other -- several 
others, there. But that, primarily. 
Q: I was wondering whether I -- I saw in your 
first interview that y
our mo th er had told  
you s -- before she died, that she -- she had told 
you to talk about -- to 
su rv iv e, an d  to  talk  
about what had happened. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And I™m wondering how mu ch 
that -- those words stayed in
 your mind, and influenced  
your -- your work, after the war. 

A: This -- the words stuck in
 my mind very -- and still now
, you know. Especially during 
the war years, there was a time at the end of 
the war year days, the last week of the war 
years, w-we went through hell, and I -- I coul
d not -- I wanted to give up, I couldn™t give 

up. I -- I mean, I couldn™t. I couldn™t walk an
y more. I just -- but I was thinking of my 
mother, I have to survive and 
tell the world what happened. 
She -- that™s what she told 
me. She told me, you™re the youngest -- and sh
e told it to Maurice, too. Wa -- say -- to 
me, she says, ﬁRemember, you are the youn
gest, you are the -- you look strong and 
healthy. You never -- y-you al
ways have been healthy. Y
ou eat right, [indecipherable]ﬂ -- 
you know, after it happened  to
 my father, you know, the -- th
ey shot my father, that™s -- 
that™s the time she told me. 
ﬁYou have to tell the world wh
at happened, because this -- 
this is a tragedy that is going to go down in
 history fo r -- for hundreds of years, wh-what 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
we see, what they doing to us
 here. And do your utmost to su
rvive. I am,ﬂ she said, ﬁI am 
old.ﬂ She was, that time 55 - 57, something th
at -- I™m n o t sure, maybe 57, or fi -- or 55. 
And that -- that always has been in my head
, you know? So when  I 
have an opportunity , 
we have some Christian friends 
here in Palm Beach, even th
ey talk about 
-- talk to me, 
they -- they indirectly find out I -- I™m a surv
ivor, or -- or Eleanor 
would say, you know, 
ﬁI -- I™m European, and I am su
rvivor of the war.ﬂ So, they 
want -- some want to know. I 
showed some of the films, th
e videotapes, they can™t belie
ve it, you know. They say it™s 
mindboggling, you know, it™s -- but that
™s -- that™s -- that™s how it was.  
Q: When  did you start to speak about your 
experiences during the 
war? Di -- when you 
met Eleanor, did you talk to her about it? 
A: I told her a little. I told he
r that I was in a concentration 
camp, but I didn™t tell her that 
much. Gradually, I would tell he
r more and more, you know.  
Q: Was sh -- did she encourage you to
 talk about it, or discourage you? 
A: I™m sorry? 

Q: Did she encourage you to 
talk about it, or did she di
scourag e you from talking about 
it? 

A: I would say she -- she would ask questions
, but I -- I never wanted to elaborate too 
much. I felt it was too upsetting to me, and 
it upsetted her, you know
. She™s very se -- 
very sensitive, you know, about th-this, you 
know. She can™t understand why these things 
should have happened. An
d a lot of it could have been avoi
ded, but nobody cared. It™s as 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
simple as that. Nobody cared
. Y-- with the boats, you kn
ow, came to the American 
shores, and sent them back. Mo
st of them perished. And now,
 anybody wants to come to 
America, comes in. Including criminals can 
come in. Nobody stops them, to -- the way 
they stopped civilized people, 
educated people, and so on. 
Q: Did -- was there a point wh ere it became important to you to talk about your 
experiences, and what had ha
ppened, or is it still -- 
A: I would tell -- yes, I was honored by Yad 
Vashem, I would tell my  story. As a matter 
of fact, only a couple weeks ago, I was ho
nored here by American Jewish Committee, 
and they wanted me to talk about it, and I di
d, yeah. And they said 
they never had such -- 
so many people came, and so many money. They 
raised ever -- they ne
ver raised as much 
money. Was a fundraiser. American Jewish 
Committee, youknow, 
they -- they fight 
bigotry, anti-Semitism,
 racism, all that.  
Q: Where did you say th at was? 

A: American Jewish Com-Committee. 

Q: And -- and that took place here, in --  
A: In Palm Beach, yes. They have a -- usua
lly a dinner, or a -- every year, you know, or 
cocktail reception. And it™s like ADL, you kno
w, Anti-Defamation League is the same 
thing, yeah. 

Q: And y-you felt -- was there a time when y
ou -- wh en you felt like you couldn™t talk 
about it, and that you were able to 
later, or how -- how did that happen?  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
A: I -- I never encouraged it, you know, I 
never, unless somebody asked me, yes, I would 
have. Bu t I would never start that. There ar
e many friends who know me for 40 years, 
they -- they ju -- and they ju
st found out last year, or tw
o years ago, whatever. But it 
became mo re among survivors, after ﬁSchindler™s
 List,ﬂ I notice they talk more openly, 
everybody talks more openly. Th
ere was -- n o t they didn™t talk
 because they were -- they 
didn™t ha-ha -- crimes they di
dn™t want to, it was too painfu
l to them to talk about it, 
because it™s -- it™s -- it™s very hard, you know,
 God forbid if people 
lose a whole, entire 
family. Par ents, sist ers, nie
ces, nephews, friends. It™s just -- it™s -- w h at I™m say ing it, I -- 
I don™t understand. I -- it™s -- it™s painful, I do
n™t understand it. But that™s -- that™s -- that -
- that is life, it happened. We have to make 
sure it does not happen  again, and that™s why 
I™m active in that, every organization who figh
ts, bigo -- bigotry, and anti -- not only anti-

Semitism, anti-Black, anti-thi --whatever. I 
am strongly against. I support every 
organization that I -- this is no -- no rhyme or
 reason for it, except, I would say -- I would 
say ignorance. Plain ignoran ce, and stupidity. We can live in a mu ch better world, why 
fight? Yes, we may have disagreements, or di
s -- different approaches to different si -- 
certain problems, but you -- we discuss it. 
You --you comp romise, or you co nvince the 
other person. Why -- that™s one thing, I neve
r -- since World War -- since I was liberated, 
after the World War two, I never had a fight 
with anybody. Never 
sued anybody, never a 
-- nobody sued me. Except when
 I had -- about 10 years ago, I had some guy here in 
Palm Beach -- not Palm -- west P alm, whatev
er, a builder, who -- who took advantage of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
54
 
 
 
 
me, anyway . Financially [indecipherable] noth
ing, you know. He forged statements and 
stuff like this, so -- I™m bigg
er and better, and I blame my self, I™m very trusting, you 
know. And this person was reco
mmended to me by my  attorney, is why I felt he can trust 
-- but -- but I -- I say, material things are -- 
I™d never -- ha-have never been a problem to 
me, I could somehow managed. 
Whatever I did -- I -- I -- I did almost to perfection, you 
know? And people like to deal 
with -- with me. My reputation 
is ses -- is great, and -- and 
I -- I hope the future generations will be free of
 all these prejudices, and mistreatments,  
and so on.  
Q: Let me ask you so -- clearly, you™re -- you™v
e had a great deal of 
success w ith -- with 
your undertakings in -- in life, and -- and I 
think th at™s not a -- many Holo caust survivors 
have been very successful after th e war. 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: And you don™t -- you -- I might think -- on
e might think that after what Holocaust 
survivors have been through, th
at -- that it would be very 
difficult to -- to achieve so 
much -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- after the war. Do you have any 
explan ation fo r that, any person -- 
A: But ma -- yeah, the majority
 did not achieve anything. You know, a lot of them -- a lot 
of them I know are poor, a
nd depend on help wi -- from ot
hers. You only -- the -- the 
visible ones, are the ones who have been su cce
ssful. Because they tr avel, they go around, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
55
 
 
 
 
and they see them at charity dinners, and so 
on. I think th e rea -- I can explain my  -- and I 
believe I mentioned it before. And I f -- I fin d
 every su rvivor who™s successful, is he 
wants to prove that he™s not treated like 
an animal, you know. That they™v e been  so 
mistreated, they want to prove 
to  the wo rld at large, that they are decent human beings, 
they™re productive in soc -- 
in society. They™re knowle
dgeable  about their work, 
whatever -- whether it™s professional or othe
rwise. And even as employees, you know, 
many of them, they try hard er, they have to wo
rk harder, they had to work, first of all, by 
starting with -- with nothing, 
you had to work hard to ge
t up the ladder a little, you know, 
and it™s very hard to make a living. I was 
successful because -- and my  brother, because 
we had some contacts -- business contacts befo
re one -- mo st of them didn™t have any. 
Had to -- had to work very ha
rd. I know people with two j
obs, you know, for years. But 
eventually , they started to make money, and 
-- and try to live better, and -- and di -- build 
some trust among business people, or profe
ssional people. I know some survivors who 
are wonderful architects, bright as -- or engi
neers I work with. But 
we never discuss any 
of it, that stuff, unless I meet 
them at some of our dinners 
where they discuss, you know, 
Holocaust matters, an d so on. 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A. You 
mentioned in your vide
otape interview, you -- 
you said at one point that -- that you -- th
at during the war, you became numb to the 
violence after awhile. And I -- I wonder if
 you could say how you 
became sensitive. I 
mean, you™re obviously a very sensitive pers
on. Was -- was it a long process to kind of 
get -- move from being numb, to
 being more sensitive again? 
A: The way I felt, obviously, it was -- ever
y bad incident, you know, were -- it like 
multiplied, work ed on you, and you -- you -- yo
u had to feel a l -- th at it -- almo st, you 
don™t see it, you know? You had to make be
lieve you don™t see it, because otherw i -- it 
was -- it -- it was so painful, you had to gi
ve up, you know? There were times y-you felt, 
you know, you™ll jump on one of 
these SS men, you -- even if 
he kills you la
ter, you want 
to kick him in his -- some 
places, you know, and do whatev
er. But that™s what I mean, 
you get -- you get so -- you ge
t numb , because you can™t do 
anything. You can -- y-you, 
it™s not only they™ll kill you, the rule was 
there, let™s say  one 
prisoner disappeared. 
Because, we had to line up every morning wi
th the same people, and the same -- you 
know, to march, you know, there were four or 
five of us, in width.
 If one disappeared, 10 
people were shot. So, we had to  police ea
ch others, nobody s
hould disappear. Some 
people even  wanted to give up, they woul
d lay down, they rathe
r, instead of running 
away, they just sat down on the 
floor, and later they killed th
em, and put them on a truck, 
or whatever. So you become
 -- that™s what I meant. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
Q: Yeah, okay. I under -- I understand that, I -- I 
think, and I just wo ndered if -- if it was 
difficult after the war, to -- to 
come back from that -- th at e
xperience of having -- having 
to numb yourself so that
 -- so that you wouldn™t g -- ex -- 
so that you™d be able to just 
contro l yourself. 
A: Right. 
Q: But I™m wondering, a-a-
after the war, how did y --  
A: I mu st have been very, ve
ry strong, you know, mentally 
strong. And if 
I could have 
seen such atrocities that -- I don™t think -- I do
n™t want to think about it. If it comes to my 
mind, I try to shut off my  mind at -- about it.
 It such -- just -- in-incomprehensible, you 
know? I don™t know how I did it, I just did 
it. You know, it™s just
 -- maybe it™s -- I had 
that mission from my mother. I 
had the -- also the anger, to ge
t even with these criminals, 
you know? And -- and ulti -- mayb 
-- I wanted to prove to myse
lf, after the war, that I am 
-- I am a decent human being, 
and I™m better than -- than mo
st of them. And I™m going to 
show it to the world that I -- I™m a good pe
rson. Why would the people who were l-like 
me, or better than me, had to -- had to -- 
had to die because of 
being one religion or 
another religion, or -- it™s -- it -- it™s -- it™s 
-- it™s a crazy, crazy 
world. Crazy, and no 
sensit -- without any hearts, without any sens
itivity. They may have had a mind, but not a 
heart at all. To be a good pe
rson, you have to have -- not 
only you have to have a good 
heart, above all, and a mind, too. Th
at™s all I really can say about it.

Q: Why don™t we go back to after you arri
ved in the United States
, and you -- maybe you 
can say something about how you -- you esta
blished your business. You -- you told the 
story on the videotap e about how you -- you 
met Eleanor, and h-how mu ch that turned 
you around, and -- and your willingness to -- 
to settle into life in
 the United States. 
A: Right. 
Q: What -- what else happened in  those early years? 

A: When I came to the United States, I came 
at the invitation of my  brother, who wanted 
me to work with him. At that time, my brot
her was in the feather and down  business, but 
when  I came, we bought a build ing on Stat
en Island, a-and it was formerly Wrigley 
chewing gum building. And since there was a 
shortage of feathers and down still, we 

went into -- to manufacture foam rubber. 
We hired some engineers from Firestone, I 
believe Firestone company, and chemists, a
nd we built a plant. Then the Korean war 
broke out, and there was a shortage of late
x. We had to  buy la
tex via Europe, where 
there™s other cu -- via Canada. We had the -- then they established 
quotas. So we work ed 
for several years, then we had to sell the pl
ant, you know, for a -- maybe two, three years 
later. [indecipherable] comp any [indecipherable
]. At that time, my brother and I, we 
started investing money in the oil busin ess, 
in -- in Texas, and Wyoming, and so  on. I 
invested a certain amount of mo
ney, and he had mo st of the 
money. It didn™t go too well, 
and then  I met Eleanor, and I 
-- around that time, and my brother Maurice came to the 
United States, about three year
s later. And he said, ﬁWhy 
you -- ano -- you have been 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
losing money there. Why you stay in the oil 
business?ﬂ The first -- so, and -- I was more 
close to Maurice, he was close in age, and 
went through together all the -- all the war 
years. So, I went back to the feather busine
ss, but my  brother Arthur stayed in the oil 
business, became very, very, very affluent. 
Was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 
and so on, became a public compa
ny. And I then went into real
 estate, into -- used to buy 
some buildings, renovate them, 
then I went into -- I had a -- a structural engineer, and -- 
and a architect. I had a -- a partner who wasan architect. We started build ing -- put up 
some buildings, and -- and I became successful with real estate. And my  other broth -- 
Maurice was -- still in the feather and down bus
iness, until he passed away about 18 or 20 
years after [indecipherab
le] -- about 20 years,
 yeah. So  his son came in, he was running 
it, and we sold it only a couple years ago. 
So, I was involved in th ese two businesses. Did 
I answer -- I hope I an
swered the question. 
Q: It seems that your family stayed very
, very  close. The -- those who su rviv ed, and 
maybe -- d-do you want to say 
anything mo re about your relationship with Maurice, and -
- after the war? 

A: Right. I was much closer to him, yes. 
My brother Arthur was 
16 years older, and he 
has his ways, a certain way and I didn™t always
 see it his way, you know? He was more -- 
I was more conservative, he was more -- he -- 
he would take chances, and so on. But he -- 
he succeeded, you know. And he -- he passed aw
ay only about six years ago. He was 86, 
then, you know?  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063

Q: Did your relation -- I mean, you had been  
so -- through so mu ch
 with Maurice during 
the war -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- di -- was your relationship with 
him very important to you, afterwards? 
A: Yes, I would say so. I don™t know, if I had 
Maurice, say -- or if Maurice had me there, 
whether we would ev en have survived, you kn
ow? It just -- just helped each other. A 
matter of fact, he wasn™t well, I w ould 
give him my  food, you know, he didn™t 
[indecipherable] food, and vice
 versa, you know, so on, it™s
 -- and we always said, we 
must survive this, and we will -- we will show
 them. We™ll take revenge on them, what 
kind of revenge, yeah . No, we™ll never go to Germany. 

Q: Did you ever talk, beyond
 that, about your -- about your experiences, or reminisce 
together, or was it -- 

A: Wi-with Maurice, yes. 

Q: With Mauri -- 

A: We did, but not too extens
ively, but we did talk about 
different -- about the family, 
about different -- other different things, yes, ov
er the years. We did. We were very close. 
Was close to Arthur, too, but different. He di
dn™t go through the war ye
ars, h-he was -- he 
was more of a free person, you know? 
Q: You mentioned the 
Korean war starting. 
A: 1950, yeah. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
61
 
 
 
 
Q: Did -- did you -- did -- did -- did you have 
a -- a strong feeling about th-the Cold War, 
about politics in the United Stat
es at that time, was that 
something that you took an 
interest in? 
A: I -- I only was ups -- upset, and I should sa
y, wh enev er I heard every day, so many 
Americans were killed, and so many were killed that I was very upset about it. But I 

didn™t think of politics, took
 me quite awhile. And I didn™t understand much about the 
system. I k n ew it™s a democratic system, but 
I didn™t understand the standard, to what 
extent. It took me awhile to -- to recogniz
e every -- everything. And once I recognize it, I 
-- of course I read about it, and spoke to people about, you know, different happenings. 

See, you get -- you get enlighten ed. 

Q: Was there anything that you can recall that 
-- that held a particular interest fo r you? I 
me -- maybe the Civil Rights movement, or Mc
Carthyism, or anythi
ng that you can think 
of? 

A: I reme mber about McCarthyis
m, yes, that I took an  intere
st, and I™ve -- I™ve felt that it 
is a -- I don™t know whether it™s th e right 
expression, demagogue, you know? He also 
accused people of being Communi
sts without having any know
ledge, or enough to prove 
th-that they™re actually Communists. He -- he wa
s a -- I think he was a disgrace to the ga 
-- to -- to the United States, and yeah, I -- I still 
feel that, if I think ab
out it, h-he wa -- he 
was doing mo re harm than ever did good. 

Q: When  were your -- when  was your first child born? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
A: My first child was born in ™53. His name
 is Andrew, and he™s an attorney, but he 
works wi-with me in real esta
te development. We had anothe
r son, James. Unfortunately, 
he -- he -- he drowned. He went
 on a vacation -- not actually 
on vacation, he went to fee -
- Eleanor -- Eleanor, my wife, Eleanor has a si
ster in Phoenix, and she had -- she has two 
sons, they were -- and -- and James, and Andrew  were very close to their sons, they were 
a similar ag e, only a couple years -- the othe
rs were a couple of years younger. When 

their son George was accepted at University 
of Colorado, and Eleanor™s sister called up 

Jim, he was very -- George was very close to  Jim, he said, ﬁYou 
know my  -- my  husband 
George,ﬂ senior, okay, ﬁwould 
like to take little George,ﬂ they
 call him, ﬁto -- to college, 
but he has busin ess appointments, and it™s di
fficult for him to go away. But like Jim,  let 
Jim take him, because he likes Jim, so 
how about Jim?ﬂ Eleanor
 was hesitating for 
awhile. She said, ﬁI™ll let you know.ﬂ She call,
 ask Jim. Jim would love to go. And he -- 
he said when geor -- when th
ey were here -- during Christma
s season they were in Palm 
Beach, and they talked 
about it, ef -- that he would take
 him to college. So he went. One 
day, Jim called us up on Friday  night, to 
tell us that -- when 
he™s coming back from 
Colo rado, which plane on -- on Su nday , beca
use he had to start school, you know? He 
went to Univ ersity of Pennsylvania War-Wart
on school. He was a year ahead in school, 
you know, very bright. Come [i
ndecipherable] on Saturday, at four -- four o™clock or so, 
we got a call from Colorado, or from Phoeni
x. From Phoenix, probably, that Jimmy  
drowned. What happened is, Ji
m took George to college, to 
the university. Then th-they 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
rented bicycles, and they drove to a waterw
ay nearby, a few mile
s away. The waterway 
had coves for swimme rs, and the buoys, you 
know, that separate the waterway from the 
coves were not -- weren™t there, because there was a storm a coup -- few days before. So 
a boat -- wh ile Jimmy went swimming laps around the cove, a boat came in. There were -
- there were other kids swimming, a little furthe
r, he may have been 20 yards, 10 yards, I 
don™t know, away from, cause you know, he wa
s an a -- he was on the swimming team, 
as a matter of fact, at the University of Pe
nnsylvania, so -- boat came in, he saw the boat 
coming in, he took a dive. When  he heard th
e boat passed, he came up, so that he didn™t 
realize that the skier -- the 
skier was a woman, she hit hi
m in the head, and he -- he 
drowned. They thought he took another 
dive. And the boat ne
ver stopped. And he 
drowned. And you aske
d -- we had depositions, 
we asked the husband 
and wife. First of 
all, on that waterway, they had to  sign a stat
ement that they can be
 only in the waterway, 
they cannot go into  the coves. He violated 
that. Then, we were in a conference room, I 
would say less wide than this room, about 
a little longer, but narrower. We™re sitting at a 
conference table, and there was a -- a pic -- a 
painting on the wall. So my attorney asked 
her, because she was wearing thick glasses, 
ﬁCan you tell me what you see in this 

picture?ﬂ She said no. ﬁOkay, are these re
ading glasses?ﬂ She sa
id, ﬁNo, these for 
distance, and sum -- I can™t read with them, 
they™re mostly for distance.ﬂ ﬁYou cannot 
identify the picture?ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁDid you wear th
ese glasses while you 
were skiing, while 
you on th e skis?ﬂ She says no. ﬁW hy didn™t yo
u wear the glasses?ﬂ ﬁI would lose them, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
they would fall off.ﬂ She th
ought it was a dog swimming. She killed him, actually, you 
know. And that™s the story ab out. 
Q: Was sh -- was she prosecuted in 
any way, or did y
ou press charges? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: We press char -- we spent a fortune in le
gal fee, couldn™t do it. They wouldn -- didn™t 
want to make a crimin al case out of it, 
because they have too many cases for killing 
people. Colo rado™s a funny state. You 
know th e maximum you get for killing a young 
person is only 10,000 dollars. We spent 
maybe 60,000 dollars in legal fees. 
[indecipherable] come 
there many times, and always they  couldn™t do anything. We even 
had witnesses, you know, that -- we hired a 
detective to figure out -- our lawy ers hired 
one to -- the whole report, but didn™t -- it wa
s nothing. They say it was not intended -- the 
-- the intention was not to kill,
 but whatever. We couldn™t 
-- we couldn™t get -- there was 
no co operation by -- even by the court. The ti -- 
it™s an accident, they say. And the kids -- 
his cousin was standing in -- looking at wh
ere Jimmy was swimmi ng, and so on, but he 
didn™t realize it, he™s n o t going to come b
ack. And the boats left, couldn™t -- you know, it 
took several days to find him, 
we had to hire -- we had -- it™s very deep water there. We -- 
we had to rent a -- from California, th
e s -- a special -- w h at do you call it? 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Special boat of so me sort, a net -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
A: Un-under the water, yeah
, the boat, the -- pardon me? 
Q: -- net -- net -- with a net, or with a -- 
A: No, it™s -- no, no, it™s -- 

Q: Oh, a submarine? 
A: It™s a little -- small submarine, to find 
him. Took three days. And th at™s something we 
can never, never talk to Eleanor about it, 
or the people ask how many ch ildren, and she 
breaks down at times. [indeciph
erable] Yeah, doesn ™t want to -- she doesn ™t want to say 
we have three, not four, so -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, he s -- was such a wond
erful, bright guy, sweet and -- 
Q: How old was he? 
A: 20. 
Q: Mm-hm. I™m sorry. 

A: Yeah. Strong. He was one of the best, one
 the best swimmers at the university. Even 
in -- even in  high school, he loved swimming. Good athlete. But -- 
Q: And your other childre
n? You -- you mentioned -- 
A: They™re wond
erful, yeah. 
Q: -- you mentioned Andrew , and -- 
A: And Lauren is -- works -- she was married 
for a short time, she™s divorced. She wo rk s 
in my office as an ex
ecutive. And then I have Carol, 
and she is married. She™s the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
youngest, and sh -sh-she has three children, tw o 
boys and one girl, they just were visiting 
us here during school vacation. They just left 
this past Sunday, yeah . They  have a boy of 
12, and a boy of 10, and a little girl of
 five. All lovely, beautiful children. 
Q: When did you move to -- I™m fo rgetting th
e name of the town in  New York  wh ere you 
lived? 
A: We lived in Forest Hills. No -- 

Q: You lived at first in Forest Hills
, when you first moved to New York? 
A: When I -- when I moved -- ye
ah, I lived in Brooklyn with -- 
Q: Brooklyn? 

A: -- my brother, yes. I shared a room with
 one of my  nephews fo
r a few months. They 
did want me -- I wanted to go to a hotel, but 
they felt it™d be lonesome, so on, so I stay 
there. But then I moved to a hotel, Saint Ge
orge Ho tel, in Brookl
yn, was an old hotel. 
And subsequently, we moved to s -- we built 
a plant on Staten Island, so I moved to 
Staten Island, rented an apartment there. An
d then we got married, we moved to Forest 
Hills. And we lived in Forest H
ills for about five years. We 
got married in ™52, and then 
™57 we moved to Great Neck, we bought a hou
se. And we still -- we don™t have the house 
any more, we sold it in ™79, 
so about 21 years ago, yeah. Bu
t we have an apartment in 
Great Neck, yeah, and an apartment here. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
Q: I -- you ma -- I don™t think 
you mentioned on tape, but some
thing that I was interested 
in -- in hearing you talk a little bit more a
bout, you said when  you 
first movedto Palm 
Springs, that there were -- 
A: Palm Beach, yeah. 
Q: Palm Beach, I™m so rry -- that -- that -- th
at there was a lot of anti-Semitism here -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and that it™s changed. Would you say 
something about that? Ho w you noticed it in 
the beginning, and how it™s changed? And -- 
A: Because we were told then
 that the Breaker™s Hotel, 30 years ago, na -- maybe 25 
years ago, actually did not permit Jews, you know
? So me people say about 30 this -- but I 
remember 25 years ago, that was the case. I 
know even a person who wanted  to check in  
with his wife, they said no 
you -- you can™t. Also, the people 
in -- if you went to stores, 
and so on, you look like you ar
e -- you don™t belong here. They
 gave that feeling. They  
were not friendly. 
Q: You personally had that
 feeling wh en you went to stores sometimes? 
A: I didn™t have it as much, but people talk
ed about it. Maybe I™m 
more tolerant than 
others, you know? And you just sense it. Y
ou know, wherever you went, it was -- they 
didn™t treat you politely. It was an -- little
 edge, you know? They didn™t want Jewish 
people to come to Palm Beach. Obviously it 
used to be, very -- almost no Jews. But as 
the Jewish people came more and more s-succe
ssful, and so they -- th
ey used to go to M-

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
Miami, and the sometime Miam
i too busy, they came here
. And now they say many of 
the Gentiles moving out. They 
go more north, you know. Some 
of them, yeah. They don™t 
-- that™s the story. But we never were insu
lted by anybody, any -- but they were cold to 
us, you know? I didn™t feel any partic
ular pressure, but some people did.  
Q: And how -- how did that change? What 
-- what made that change? Can you -- 
A: I think we became very active in the 
hospitals, two hos -- Saint Mary was the 
Christian hospital, and Good Samaritan was mo
re like a private estate operated -- Jewish 
people, I would say, made major contributions to the hospitals. A
nd eventually the two 
hospital merge. Many Jewish doctors cam
e from -- from New Yo
rk, or wherever. 
Chicago, and so  on. And Chri
stians. The hospitals became much more staffed better. 
They  bought equipment, you know. Here, yo
u need  a major operation, you couldn™t -- 
you had to go to  Miami or New 
York, or wherever else. Now,
 the hospitals are very well 
staffed, very good medical research they™re
 doing, and they are connected with New 
England Hospital, in Massachusetts someplace, and also Mount Sinai, New York. 

Videotape -- they can videotape operations, a
nd there -- there™s a big, big, big change. 
People, when they took 
sick, they used to go 
to their hometown, back
 to their own doctor. 
Now, they don™t do it. Plus, we also helped
 building the Kravitz Ce
nter, which is a -- a 
place where they -- they have operas, and they
 have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I 
think it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but 
a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more 
than half the money came fro m Jewish people. There™s a little
 more -- more culture. I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
would say th ey contributed money to the -- to
 small  muse ums, and s -- and now the Jews, 
and the Gentiles work together 
in all these places, 
so it™s -- it™s a very good relation. Once 
a year they have a ball for 
the -- for the hospital, you know? You have -- we have many 
fine Christians, and fine Jewish people meet, 
and also the Kravitz Center, they meet, have 
special gala nights, you know? So
 at least once, or more than
 once a year, different artists 
come from all over -- from all 
over the -- the country, and 
-- and Europe. The Moscow 
orchestra recently, and the -- some
 French theater -- what do th
ey call, I forget -- artist 
performing, and so on. 
Q: You -- you mentioned -- oops, I™m going to flip the tape. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: You mentioned Eleanor™s in
volvement with the -- what was the name of the organ -- 
A: [indecipherable] Christian and Jews. She wa
s the -- the first person, with a few other, 
with some Gentile friends, to start this orga
nization, and sh -- and 
she was the education 
chairman. She knows a 
lot about Holocaust, and about 
general inter-religious, you know, 
differences. And so she™s very, very knowledge able, and she served fo
r a couple years in 
the -- they wanted her to 
stay. I discouraged her from 
staying long, I said, ﬁGive 
somebody else a chance,ﬂ and -- and so on. 
[indecipherable] felt very dominating, you 
know? So the one atto rney took over, [indecipherable] or
 Brian, what is it? I can™t 
remember his name, he™s very 
good, but he also, after two y
ears, he starts his third one 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
70
 
 
 
 
now. Ch ristian, lovely -- they all -- tell 
you a -- I find it may be my  -- I -- I hope I™m not 
wrong, I find the -- the educated people rela
te more, cause the Jewish educated people, 
yeah, they  have someth
ing in -- in common. The uneducate
d are -- are more hateful, for 
some reaso n , on Jews, I don™t know. Ignoran
ce. And that probably is everywhere. They 
don™t understand that we -- we are people, we
 are good and bad in  
every religion, ev ery 
race, I find they have good an
d bad people. People wh
o contribute to society, and people 
who don™t. People who try to make it a wor --
 a better world, and people who don™t care, 
or obstruct. But that™s society, that™s -- 
who knows how many year
s this will take, how 
many generations, you know, for this to im
prove and vanish? We all want a better -- 
better -- better world for our chil
dren, grandchildren, and so on. 
Q: Yo-Y ou mentioned in your videotape, yo
u -- you to ld of two dreams that you had 
during th e -- during the war. One during
 the war, and one after the war -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- which were very important in some way, and I -- 

A: Right. 
Q: I was wondering if you have any -- if
 you feel -- do you have a strong -- do you 
believe in -- in intuition versus rationality, or -- 

A: I -- I tell you, I don™t -- I don™t know whether 
I believe in intuitions or not, but I ha -- I 
really don™t know, but I know 
that was a dream. It was n o t just imaginary, it was 100 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
71
 
 
 
 
percent dream, that I was -- I -- if your may 
-- shall I repeat the story, or you know the 
story? 
Q: You can if you want 
to, but we do have it. 
A: I will brief -- I™ll make it brief. 
Q: Okay . 
A: In my  dream was a l-lady who was a neig
hbor of ours. She was childless, and she, 
when I was young, as a child, 
ma ybe ev en wh en I was seven, six, seven, she always liked 
to play with me, and see what I™ve done in
 school, you know, she 
wa -- she was like my 
second mo th er. She was -- she just li -- we we
re next door neighbors. I woke -- and she 
[indecipherable] she called me
 No ck mu sh . My  n ame was No ch man ,  my  Heb r ew n ame, 
and she called me Nock mu sh, you know? ﬁNoc
kmush, Nock mu sh, don™t go there. Don™t 
go. Listen to me, don™t go,ﬂ she told me. ﬁD
on™t go to meet these 
people.ﬂ Sh e told me 
several times. I woke up. I was suppo-posed to
 meet these two individuals. I was -- I was 
-- I don™t know wh at to do. I said, ﬁI™m not 
going.ﬂ I didn™t go, and these two guys, one 
was Christian, one was Jewish
, they -- they had all people
 getting out of -- from Poland, 
young people, military age. They
 -- they must have bribed
 some Italian who were in 
charge of -- they went by -- in
 Kraków they used 
to stop, for some reason or another. So  
what they  would do, they wo
uld get unifo rms, and bandaged
 up, let™s say like -- a guy 
like me, they put [indecipherable] bandaged  
up, and make believe you can™t talk. They  

put you on the train, you know? 
Take drove you up there, put
 you on th e train, and you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063
 
 
72
 
 
 
 
can™t [indecipherable]. That™swhat I -- my parents and my 
brother felt, let somebody at 
least get out, so they -- maybe you™ll be able 
to get in touch with Arthur in the United 
States, and so on. Something -- do something. 
But I didn™t go. So, now I lived in Italy, 
and after I was there maybe a year, I had a very
 strong desire to go back to Poland. And -- 
and my brother Maurice, too. He di -- I was 
h esitating a little bit, for one reason, but he 
definitely wanted to go. I want
ed -- what we wanted to do 
is, we wanted to -- we -- we 
marked up where they shot my father, and they -- they left 
him there, and then  we buried 
him. We -- we measured how f -- how many feet
 from th at tree to 
this tree, to this 
location, that location. And there were two 
other men [indecipherable] put them in that 
burial place,  not just -- so my father came to
 me, he said , ﬁDon™t come. I -- we were all 
burned, you won™t find any -- yo
u won™t find any ashes even.ﬂ 
All burned. What they did, 
they excavated men from wher-wherever they we
re buried, and they pu
t them in fa -- put 
them in one group, an d burned th em. So I don™t want -- the other reason I didn™t want to 

go, right after the war, I le -- I learned in M
unich, if you go back to  
Poland, they  draft you 
-- if you -- in the 20™s, you kn
ow, from 19 to 28, or to 30, 
I don™t rememb er exactly. They 
draft you in the Russian army, 
they put you. So I was that tim
e 22 years old, so I didn™t 
want to go. That™s one of the 
reasons why I never went back to
 Poland. I don™t want to go 
in the ar -- in the Russian army
 after all this. And my brother 
felt -- he™s nine years older, 
he -- he -- him they don™t want to draft. He 
looked a little frail, too, that time. H e -- they 
probably wouldn™t ha -- but I -- I -- I felt pr
etty -- for all that I -- pretty healthy.

Q: Did you ever have any ot
her dreams in your life that
 were important to you? 
A: No. These two [indecipherable]
 these are the only two. I be
lieve there is something to 
do it. I have other dreams, simi lar, not -- not as strong. I -- because I don™t even  
remember. I know I had certain dreams, but I 
don™t remember them.  My sisters came to 
me [indecipherable] like -- like not -- I would se e my mother or my father in my sleep, 

just like it was, you know, 50 years ago.
 But they don™t usually talk to me. 
Q: They just appear? 

A: Yeah. Bu t this, actually were words.
 I -- I™m convinced something mu st be 
superhuman, to -- to -- to have -- to witne
ss that, to experience that. But it happened. 
Maybe somebody™s watching over me.  

Q: Why don™t you tell again, 
how -- you said it in the vide
otape, but it might be mo re 
comp lete if you said how you found out ab
out what had actually happened to  your 
father™s body. 

A: It came in my dream. He came and told me
 that they burned all of me, an d the two 

others. 
Q: But didn™t you have a brot
her-in-law who -- who had told 
you that -- cause he -- yeah. 
A: Oh, that™s right. When my brother-in-law 
came to Italy then, su bsequently , I ask him, 
did you -- because he returned 
to Poland, and he was not of military  age. And he stayed 
in Poland for maybe a year, or less. At least 
six months to a year. And I -- we ask him, 
did you go to -- because he was 
with us in that brush factor
y, you know, the -- and he saw

when  they  took my  brother out and two of 
his, you know, friends. Whoever buried him, 
he was part of it. Did he ever go back to 
Plaszów to see about ou
r father, you know? He 
said, ﬁYes, I went several ti
mes. I found out th
ey ex -- they exca
vated everybody, and 
they burned them.ﬂ The whol
e -- they -- when they liqui
dated Plaszów, befo re the 
Russian came, there were couple hundred people 
to clean up. Course, what they  did there, 
I -- I think they -- they killed tens of thous
and of people there, from med -- I -- I would 
say mostly Gentile. They br
ought in from outside the ca
mp. I don™t know for what 
charges, whether -- they mos
tly young people. Th
ey were -- they br
ought them on open 
trucks, because they -- they brou
ght it up to a hill there. And wh
at -- what they did is they 
beat them, and they  had to und
ress, and they were all -- they
 -- during the day, they -- 
every -- they were excavating trenches, y
ou know? Maybe a hundred people ex cavating 
the -- prepare for loads, and th
en  they buried them, covered th
em up. So that wa -- they 
excavated th e -- again, and burned them, 
you know? That™s what I was told by my  
brother-in-law, yeah. 
Q: How did your -- how did Maurice respond wh
en  you had that drea
m? Did he -- did he 
take it at -- at -- did he belie
ve that it was true, or how -- 
A: He believed it was true. Because the fact 
is, that two people were killed. He said, 
ﬁYou -- you -- you were told, you were gi -- 
were given a warning 
by -- how to explain 
that?ﬂ Believe in -- believe in God, or -- or 
-- or some superpower? I -- We don™t know. If 
-- if you™re religious, it™s a messag e from God, 
if it™s -- or, they can explain it many other

way. I don™t know. I would say if -- after the 
war, I did not believe in God. It took me a 
number of years, and I do believe
 in God. Bu t can I prove things? Of course not. Certain 
things, but it™s -- but you have to  accept it. 
Eleanor, not having all this experien ce, she 
doesn ™t believe mu ch in God. 
She says why -- especially sinc
e we lost Jimmy. Says why, 
why, why, was such a wonderful boy. We -- we
 all did things -- right things, and so  on. 
And -- and I suffered so much, and [indecipher
able] you know? So it™
s hard to -- I -- I 
keep telling her I don™t want to 
hear that, that she shouldn™t di
scuss it. I believe in it. Why 
I believe in it, I don™t know. Just -- I feel 
it™s easier maybe on your -- on your mind, and 
your spirit to believe than not to believe. 
Because otherwise it --
 the whole thing is 
nothing. 
Q: Do you have any in
terests or hobbies, or pash -- passi
ons, outside of your wo rk th ings, 
that you love to do? 

A: I love the work that I do. I really do. I 
like to build buildings. 
The reason I like it is I 
see in front of my eyes, take a piece of la
nd that nothing [indecipherable] mud or grass, 
and -- and you build so mething 
that is pretty, that people want, and people are happier, 
you know? Whatever we build, 
one the biggest pr-pr-prize is 
revenue. I -- only the best 
that can be done. It™s my nature, and I like to
 play golf, but I  not -- only on weekends, I 
play golf. And I swim, walk, y
ou know, when  I have time. I have a treadmill here. I don™t 
-- I walk more on the treadmill. A nd I am in 
good shape. I got -- ex
cept for hearing. I™m 
in such good sh
ape, doctors don™t believe. Anyway , 
I™ve never been  to
 hospital, sick.

Q: Really? Wow? 
A: I never had a cold . 
Q: Wow. 

A: I don™t get flu™s or colds, or -- 
Q: Great. 
A: Never. I don™t know, maybe the immune 
system built up there, I don™t know, you 
know? They -- they 
can™t believe it.  
Q: That™s good. 
A: Yeah. I don™t tell anybody that. Very fe
w people I tell that 
I™ve never had a cold. 
[indecipherable] this a 
problem, that -- this problem, that
 problem, I said no. I used to 
have b-big problem with my  hands, I couldn™t,
 I™d say, I could never hold even  a cup of 
coffee or tea, had to hold w
ith both hands. Bu t I was talking 
to my fingers 
not to bother 
me. 
Q: And they listened? 

A: I really said, ﬁGive me a break, don™t both
er me.ﬂ I used to soak
 in hot water, in the 
mo rning, and at night, you know, that what 
I -- and massage it, all th is. And it -- over the 
years it™s got better and better. Some medication 
I took, it were -- upset my sto mach, and 

I stopped taking it, and all th
is. But after that, okay.  
Q: Good. All right. Norman, do you have an
ything th at you would like to say that I 
haven™t asked you ab out?
