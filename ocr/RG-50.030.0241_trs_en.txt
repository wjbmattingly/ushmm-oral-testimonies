Q:  GoodAfter n oon.Woul

and your  pl a ce of birth?  
 

A:  We ll my  na me  was  Ger d  G- EŒ R- D Sig mu n d
(ph) von Halle . Wa s bor n on Dece mber  2, 
1922, i n Ha mbur g, Ger ma ny. 
 

Q:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?  

 

A:  I ha d one br other  a nd hi s  na me  wa s Hans  Jü
rge n(ph), and he  was l  
ye ar and nine  months 
older  than I wa s. 
 

Q:  And what  was your fathe r 's oc cupation?   

 

A:  My father 's  occ upati on Œ he  was  a n ar chitect
, speci alizing i n bui lding depart me nt stor es i n 
Ha mbur g. 
 

Q: Wo uldyoutell 
me a little bit about you
r childhood while you 
were in Hamb urg? 
 

A:  We ll, it wa s a very ple asa nt 
time . My father was doing rather
 well as an ar chi tect. We  lived 
in a  upper middle  cla ss  neighbor ho
od in Ha mburg. We  
we nt t o  public  sc hools t her e, and li fe  
was, was pretty nice al
though I understand when
 I was a baby, of cour
se Œ this was still Œ 
we 're talking about 1922, 
‚23, there was, they 
had it  was  at t he  e nd 
of World Wa r I and the 
inflation I understand fr
om my mother that they
 bought a bottle of mi
lk for a million marks 
and s o on, s o  ti mes  were  not  that  ea sy whe n 
I was a baby, but I don't  
reme mber that. And we 
we nt t o publi c sc hool, we nt t o
 what t h ey call Oberr ealschul e
1
, which you wo uld call here a 
junior high school. And then H
itler well, of course, in 1930 
and ‚31 and ‚32,
 Hitler became 
more popular and things
 became more difficult
 for the Jews althou
gh I was still a young 
child and not quite 
a ware  of e ver ythi ng t hat was going on
. I n 1933, Hi tler c a
me t o powe r as  
Chancellor and then, of course, 
things changed very dramatical
ly. I still 
remember 
being in 
juni or high s chool as an 11 
year  ol d a n d we  ha d to l earn how
 t o give  the 
Hitler salute. 
 

01: 03: 00  

 

 So here we were marching ar
ound in the gymnasium
 giving the Hitler sa
lute in the proper 
fashi on. And whenever t h ere wa
s a holiday every house had to 
displ ay a fla g. It wa s e ither 
the s wasti ka  fla g or  the  Ger man fla g a nd we 
didn't display either one 
of them, but then we  
wer e t old tha t  we ha d t o a nd 
so my  father went ou
t and he bought t he Ger ma n fla g bla ck, 
red and gol d fla g, a nd s o we  di spla ye d that  on
 the balcony and my  fa
ther  was very much 
aware t hat  there was no 
future  for us. So si nce  he  had a  
sist er mar ried to
 a Dutchman in

Amst erda m, he deci de d t o move  to Amst er
da m. Furthe r more , a
lthough we had been 
thinking i n t er ms of goi ng t o 
America, but America in 1933 
wasn't  exactl y streets weren't 
lined with gold and I thin
k Ameri ca di dn't nee d a  Ger man arc h
it ect at  that particular  ti me, so 
we  move d t o  Ams t er da m.  Ams t er da m in t hos e 
days was an absolutely
 delightful place to 
live. I woul d sa y probabl y one  
of the mo st wonder
ful times of my li
fe I 've  s pent  in 
Amsterdam as a young ma n. It
 was a very quiet,
 easy going lifestyle
. The Dutch were 
delight ful pe ople . Everyt hing we nt ve ry sl owly
. Everyt hing wa s very ne at. Eve ryt hing wa s 
very cle an. And so there  we, 
we went to sc hool e ven thou
gh when we arri ved there the 
Dutch schools were wa y ahead of
 the German schools and so 
I  was  Œ and both my br other 
and I, we  were both put back 
one clas s  so we  were  put  ba ck 
one  gra de . Holla nd, a s I  sai d, 
wa s, was  del i ght ful unevent ful  t o a  de gree  an
d, a n d we  were  not Œ a nd of c ours e, the war 
clouds  start e d gathering i n t he l ate ‚30s. An
d we were not  too much
 worried about Holland 
being Œ bec o mi ng invol ved i n t he  
war because in the last war, that is, World War I, Holland 
wa s neutr al. And for  wha t ever  rea son Œ I  ca n't  
gi ve  you the  rea s on, bu
t  for  whatever reason, 
we  felt  and t he Dutc h pe ople  felt  that beca use  
we  wer e  neutr a l in Wo
rld Wa r I we probably 
will  re mai n neutr al i n World War  
II. Needless to say, th
at did not turn out 
t o  be  true a nd i n 
May of 1940 the German
 army moved into Ho
lland and the war really
 was over before it 
even began because the whole Dut c
h army  had to capitul
ate  wi thin a peri od of four or fi ve 
days t hat we wer e no mat ch for the  Ge r ma n 
ar my who came 
in wi th a tr e me ndous  a mount 
of ai r power  etceter a, 
etcetera, etcetera.  
 
01: 07: 00  

 

 Being a Jew, of course, that wa
s  a  ver y , very unse ttl in
g ti me  for  us. We  di dn't  know what  t o 
expect. We saw the Ger man ar my 
mar ching t hrough t he street s. 
For the first time in my life, 
I see  t he gre en uni for ms  whi ch was  t he uni for m 
of the  Ges t apo. I 'd never s een that  be fore, 
and they marched through 
the  str eets , a nd to be  very hone st
, we wer e quite  fr ighte ne d by all 
of t his . As  it turne d out , t he fi rst yea r  of 
the occupation was completely uneventful. The 
Germans in that fi rst ye
ar of occupation behaved almo st 
unbeli e vabl y ge ntle ma n-li ke. They 
didn't bother anybod
y. There wer e no r eal 
proble ms . Unt il one  day, a  gr oup of young Je ws 
wer e ar rested i n Amst erdam just
 haphazardl y. They wer e j ust  
t aken off t he street . There was 
no reas on for  it. And t hey wer e
 ar reste d. And then followe d by
 a bout a  mont h or s o l ater , 
there was Œ I don't k
now whether it 's exactl y t he way 
it happened, but there wa s an 
expl osi on in a Ger ma n 
officer's club . No w wh et
he r it wa s an e xpl osion or  s o mebody l et the 
soup boil over or wh atever ha
ppened, I don't know
 what  happe ned, but  they de cide d t o 
arrest 225 young German Jews
. Not Dutch Jews, German Je
ws. An d so one night I was 
coming home. I  ca me  home  ar ou
nd four  o'clock. My brot he
r  wa s worki ng, le arni ng the  
met als  trade, and my brot her 
came
 home about I would say aro
und fi ve-t hir t y. We  live d on 
the ground fl oor  in Amste r da m and our bic ycl
es were outside on th
e window, so people 
knew that we were home.  
 

01: 10: 00  

 

 And t he  door bell  ra ng, a nd I never ga ve it  
a second thought and I wa
lked up t o t he front  
door, opened up t he do
or, and t w o me n i n brown l eather  
c oats  pus he d t heir  wa y past  me ,

went into the living room, and 
came out with a list and they 
asked me  whethe
r anybody by 
the na me  of Ha ns  Jür ge n (ph)  von Hal l e lived 
he re. Well , my br other  was  i n the bac k r oom 
and trut hfull y, I didn't  know what t o s ay, a nd 
be for e I could sa y anythi ng my brot her  ca me  
out of the back room an
d he wa nte d t o  know what  wa s goi ng
 on a nd they turned to hi m and 
said, " What 's  your  na me? "  An
d he sai d, "My na me  is Hans
 J ürgen(ph) von Hall e."   
 
01: 11: 00 

 

 And t he n t he y s aid, "I s t h ere a  Ger d Carl vo
n Hall e  her e? " I s aid, " N o."  The y  sai d, " What 's 
your na me ." I sai d, "M y na me is
 Gerd Sigmund von Halle." They
 said, "Well, that must be 
the sa me  one ." So they put us  un
der ar rest and t hey pu
shed us  out t he front
 door  jus t  t he wa y 
we  were . We  di d not  ha ve  ti me
 to sa y goodbye  to 
our pare nts . And the y
 ma rched us fr om 
our  hous e t o the Gesta po hea dquarter s  in A mst
er da m. Now whe n I  sa y 
t he y mar c he d us , we  
wer e not  ha ndcuffed. We  wer e j ust  Œ my brot he

ing there individually, 
and these t w o Gestapo ag

foll owed behi nd a bout  Œ I don't  

know Œ 20 fe et behi nd, a n d all  they
 di d is t ell us  tur n ri ght , t urn l eft , strai ght  a hea d. And s o  
that if you had passed us by 
on the street, you would never 
in a million ye
ars would you 
have known that t he se t w o yo
ung boys were unde
r arrest. And we arri ved at  Gestapo 
hea dquarter s , oh, I  would sa y ar ound five-thirty, 
si x o'cl oc k. And we wer e
 one  of the l a st to 
arrive , and when I l ooke d around
 I saw practically all of my fr
ie nds  were  the r e. There  we re 
226 young German Jews all line
d up in that Gestap
o headquarters which 
was a for mer  gi r l s 
school .  
 

01: 13: 00  

 
 An d we wer e  lin ed  u p 
down in t he ba se ment , an
d we  were shouted at 
and yelled at and, you 
know, we ha d t o st and a t  attent
i on. And we  st ood a t  atte ntio
n fr om si x o'clock until  a bout 
mi dni ght . And we wer en't al lowe d t o talk. We  
weren't allowed to move . We  were n't allowe d 
to go to the bathroom
. And ar ound mi dni ght  the  c o mma nda
nt  of the  Ges t apo hea dquarte rs 
stepped for ward and said, "Is 
the re anybody here  who ha s a  
se rious  a nd I me an seri ous  
illness to report?" And he expl
ained that anybody wh
o would be fo oling 
him, he explained 
what t he  dra stic c onse quence s of t hat  woul d be
. My brot her , who was sta ndi ng ne xt t o  me, 
pus he d me  s ort of wit h hi s el
bow and said, " Ste p for ward."  a
nd I whispere d bac k t o hi m, I 
said, " What  can I, what  c an I  tal k
 about ?" It so turn
ed out as a child I wa
s, I was not one of 
the strongest kids on th
e block. I suffered a gr
eat deal from bronchitis
 which 5,000,000 other 
people  suffer  from, and my brot her  
sai d t o me , "Te l l hi m you ha ve TB
2
" I never had TB in 
my  life, thank goodness. An d I 
wa s very, very, very 
reluct ant  t o st ep fo
r w ar d because I was 
afr aid of the consequences b
ecause they t old me what the 
consequences wo uld be if you 
lied. But he sort of in
si ste d on it, and s i nce  he  was  my 
older  brother by a  ye a r and al most 
two years, I stepped for w ard an
d I  ha d to go i nto he  took 
me i nt o a  room and he  sa ys , 
" What 's  the  matt er wit h you? " And 
I said to hi m, "I s u ffer  from

that I suffer from TB They in 
turn went to my family physicia

by the name of Dr . Hertzberger. Dr. Hertzber
ger , when my par ent
s told him what had 
happened wr ote out  a cert ifi cate which I gave
 to the museum, whic
h states that I am 
suffering fr om TB No w,  so we're here now 
back i n  the Gest apo 
headquarters in the 
base me nt  a n d ar ound mi dni ght  or  l o'cloc k 
in the morning we were transported from 
Amst erdam i n buses t o a camp ca

01: 18: 00 

 

 Thi s wa s a  c a mp surr ounded a nd pr ot ected 
by t he  Ge stapo. And 
we stayed there for 
approxima tely, oh, I would say, 
s o me where  in the  neighborhood 
of si x to ei ght  wee ks. Our 
treat ment now certai nl y wasn't 
good but  it wa sn't brutal  t o 
t he degr ee t hat  you know, we  
learned later  on what  happened
 in concentration camps. We  
we re s ubj ecte d to all  t he 
harassment and so on, but no
body was killed th
ere. One day I wa
s called into the 
commandant's office, and as I we
nt int o t he offic e I  snapped at
 a ttenti on and i n fr ont  of hi s  
des k a nd I looke d down on his 
des k and I  sa w a l ett er. I  c oul
d se e it eve n t hough it  was  
upside down. I could see it was a 
letter of Dr. Hertzberger. And 
the  c o mmandant  sa ys  to me , 
" What 's  wrong wi th you? " 
An d I said to him,  "I suffer fr om
 TB" And t his  man see me d to be  
the kind of individual that certa
inl y di d not  want  to be  in th
e pre senc e of a nybody who ha d a  
cont agi ous disease and he sai d t o me, " Get  
out of he re a nd get  a n d get out  of t he ca mp 
i mme diat ely." So I  ra n ba ck t o my bar r acks . I 
s aid goodbye  to my br
ot her  who was wi t h me  
there, and I  was rel eased that  
day. And now there were 224 bo
ys left. These 224 boys that 
sa me da y we re se nt  from this loc al c o nc
entration camp to proba
bly one of the mo st 
infa mous  c o nce ntrati on c a mps  of all  c alled Ma ut
hausen in Austria. I 
came back from camp. 
I arri ved, I  had no mone y. I  
hitc hhike d my wa y ba ck t o Am

very, ver y busy going ar ound seei
ng all of t he par ents  of my 
fr iends who had bee n t her e a nd 
telling everybody that ev
erybody was doing well 
under the circumstance
s etcetera, etcetera. 
We  received a card fr om my  brother from the 
conc entrati on ca mp M aut hausen whic h i s Œ 
now remember, we're talkin
g a bout t h e year 1941. That  wa s i n
 the early part of the war. We  
received a letter, a post card fro
m hi m, which was a sort
 of a printed post 
card. It  just said, 
"I,ﬂ then he filled in his na
me, ﬁHans Jürgen von Halle,

t o  recei ve a let t er li ke t his, but  
the r eason why we r ecei ved it  
because as I said be
fore, it was st ill 1941. 
We  also received 
two letters fr om him. 
The letters I also gave to the 
Holocaust Museum.

s o we deci ded one  da y, 
actuall y from one da y t o  the  next  we deci ded to
 le ave  our hous e. And 
I wa nt you to know 
that we j ust  l eft  the house  just
 the way it was, with 
the pictures on the walls and the food in 
the r e frigerat or and the cl othes i n t he closet  an
d, and, and nothing was 
taken. The only thing 
we  di d i s we  gave t he ke y to our a part me n
t t o one of our  ne igh
bors  who we  kne w a nd 
trusted and these were two la
dies which I will come back 
to later on in my story. 
 
01: 30: 00  

 

 And they ha d a key to the apartment. But we  
just l eft . I onl y att ended
 coll ege for  one  ye a r . 
And one of t he colle ge  pr ofes sors . Hi s  na me  wa
s Mr. In't Hout , I- N-a p
ostrophe- T  H-O- U- T. 
In't  Hout, tha t was  his  na me . I  ca lled hi m a nd I 
told him what our situ
ation wa s. And wi thout 
blinking a n e ye, without
 hesitati ng for  one  minute , he sa
ys, "Come right ov
er." And so we 
walked out  of the apartment and we  went to Mr. 
In't Hout's  apartment an
d it  wa s j ust a small  
Œ wa s a  fa mi ly of four , a hus ba nd and wi fe an
d t w o c hildr en, a boy a n
d girl about my  age. 
And t here was no room for t hre
e people. Th ere we re only tw
o Œ it was, it was a three-
bedr oom a pa r t me nt  and one r oom was  oc cupied
 by the parents and on
e room was occupied 
by the  gir l  a nd one r oom was  oc cupie d by the  bo
y, and what  they did is
 they put the boy and 
the girl  toget her i n one r oom a nd gave  me t h
e third room and their 
brot her-i n-la w t ook my 
pare nts . Now t he  pr obl e m was , now that we ar
e no l onger offi cially in resi dence i n our  
regul ar home, we  now no l onger ha ve ac ces s 
t o r ationi ng ca rds. Ra
tioning cards is the 
lifeline to food. And these two 
la dies  who were living above us
, t hey belonged t o t he  Dut ch 
undergr ound, a nd they supp
lie d us  wit h rati oning c ards . And so
 we  sta ye d i n that my par e nts 
at the i n-la w s, i n t he  br ot her-i n-la w's house  and 
I  i n Mr . In't Hout 's  house . We  st aye d f or a  
couple of months ‚til they fo
und a quote permanent residence 
for us, which wa
s on a farm 
house in the south of Ho
lland, a small village 
maybe couple of hundre
d people in the whole 
village. The name of the village
 was Alrijksdaal(ph). A small 
town not known 
for anything 
exce pt t he y ma ke  churc h  bell s.
 We  went t o Alr ijks daal( ph) , a
nd we we nt to th
is farm house 
and it was a great  relief because 
wher eas i n Amsterdam we had to
 stay wit hi n t his one r oom, 
in t he far m hous e at  ni ght  at l east , I  c o uld go 
out  into t he gar de n  and 
so on and walk around 
in t he mi ddle  of the  ni ght. And e ver ything wa
s  pre
tt y pleas ant  there ‚til  one  day a Mr . and 
Mrs. Kahn(ph) arrived 
also, another Jewish co
uple. And Mr. Ka
hn(ph) was a very
 nice little 
gentl e men. You mi ght c all hi m i n
 English, in the American sl
ang, you mi ght c all hi m, he 
was a milky toast. A no
thing indivi dual. Very nic e , l ove
l y per s on. His  wi fe , the  e xact  
opposit e. His wi fe was a beauti ful l ady, a tr em
endous flirt, and befo
re you turned around, 
she took up an affair  wit h t he far mer  who 
ha d a  wife  who ha d childr en. And I  gues s t he 
far mer 's wi fe  was  not quit e ha
ppy about the situation. An d 
in desperation when to the 
authorities and told them that th
ere were Jews in there Œ in th
is house. Unbekno
wn to us, of 
course. And so one night we we
re sitting at the dinn
er table, which was 
downstairs, facing 
the street  a n d a s I ' m l ooking ou
t t he window, I all  of a  s udden 
see a small car,
 small German

army car pulling up with four
 Ger ma n  Gesta po a ge nts j u mping out  of the  c a r and r unni n g 
into the house. Well, as we 
sa w the c ar  arri ving, we , e ver yb
ody we nt di ffer e nt wa ys . M y 
father went up into th
e  atti c. Mrs . Ka hn(ph)  went  out 
the back door into
 the woods. Mr . 
Ka hn( ph)  we nt i nto the be droom
, in hi s bedr oom. 
My mother we nt i nto our be droom a nd 
hid in a closet, and I went into
 a toilet and behind 
the toilet there was a 
little ledge and I sort 
of cr ouche d behi nd the le dge . And be f ore I  e v
en c o uld tur n a round I 
c oul d he ar the Ge sta p o 
age nt ar resti ng my father  be cause I  c o uld he ar
 hi m talki ng t o my fat her . And Mr . Kahn( ph)  
was arr ested i mmediat ely. And the far mer  was arr e sted. 
 
01: 36: 05  

 

 So what  t hey di d is  t hey 
t ook all  of t h e suitcases fr om
 Mr s. Ka hn( ph) , Mr. and Mr s. 
Ka hn( ph)  a n d t hey put t h e m int o our bedr oom.
 And our s uitc a ses were in t he be droom. And 
they put the suitcases 
all  in fr ont  of my mother 's  cl os
et  wher e s he wa s hidi ng. And e ver y 
closet  i n t he house was opened
 up except  that  one closet. W
hy? Because t h ey t hemselves 
barricaded t h at one closet  and so t hat was t he 
r eas on why they didn't  get  
in there. They left  
wit h t he pris oner s, with my fat her , M r . Ka hn( ph)
 and the and t he far mer
, a nd the y seal e d t he 
room. Th ey sealed the 
room in which my  mo ther wa s hidi
ng. The  put a wa x s eal on it  a nd 
they said they wo uld be
 back two hours later to
 get, to get  the goodie s
. And a s s oon a s t he y 
left, I got  out  of my closet , out  
of my li ttle hidi ng pl ace i n t he, 
i n  the toi let and I  spoke t o my 
mother  over  the phone. And I 'll
 tell  you quite  fra nkly i n al l my l i fe  I  ha ve  ne ver ma de  a  
more di ffi cul t de cisi on than I  di
d at t h at point . My mother  came
 out of t he cl oset  and we are 
now dis cus si ng what  to do next
. We c oul dn't get out of t h
e house because t h e house was 
surrounded. If there 
were 200 families Œ if th
ere were 200 people in 
the, in the village, I 
think al l 200 hundred we re st an
ding a round the  house . So ther
e was no wa y to
 get her  out 
through t he window or a nyt hing li ke  that. Besi de
 the wi ndow wa s up on 
t h e second floor. So 
the questi on wa s re ally s h oul d yo
u st a y i n t he clos et or  s hould
 you go under the bed. Th at 
was t he onl y two alter nati ves in
 tha t  lit tle room. And I  de cide
d, base d on not hing, ba sed on 
gut  feeli ng i f you want  to call it
, t hat  I wa nte d her t o go under  
t he be d. So s he we nt  under the 
bed and I went back into my 
little hiding place 
there. And sure enough
, couple of hours later 
they came back an
d t he y  opened the  r oom and t he y e mp
tied out every cl oset
, ever y suitcase. 
They took the suitcase,
 put it on top of th
e bed. Ac tually only
 t wo me n ca me back. 
Ori ginal ly they we re four . Now, t he y onl y 
had two men came  back. 
On e wa s standing on 
one  si de of t he be d. The other  guy wa s sta ndi
ng on the  ot her  si de 
of the bed. An d they 

e mptie d out  t he suitc ase s. And I re me mber l i ke  
it wa s yeste r da y. I had the first el ectric  r azor  
that ever was made. Not that I was the first one,
 but it wa s one  of t he first  ra zors  ever ma de 
by Phillips. And all of a sudden 
I hear my razor goin
g. And well these gu
ys had never seen 
an electri c r
a zor. And so, ﬁTha
t was good for me. I'
ll t ake  the ra zor." And t h en t he y pulle d 
out  a suit , and " We ll, that  suit
 fit s my brot her-i n-la w." And "T
hat dr ess, t hat 's
 good for my 
girl frie nd." " And t hat  thi n g."  The  enti r e th
i ng was divi ded up between these two charact ers 
whi le my mother  was under t he bed.

the l oot . I f you analyz e it , you 
t hink a bout it , here  is a  woma
n under t he  be d. I f she  had as 
much as  c oughe d, s neez e d or 
anyt hing! The di ffer ence bet wee
n Œ  wh at we  so meti me s f orget  
is the di ffer ence bet w een bein
g caught  and not  being 
c aught  is t he di ffer enc e  bet w een bei ng 
alive or  dead. That 's the differe
nce. There i s no, t here is no 
Œ you know, i f you ca n al wa ys, 
say, " We ll, I got  ca ught. You k
now, I  stol e, I stol e  an a pple  a n
d t he cop on th
e cor ner  caught 
me  a nd he  put me  in a  jai l  fo
r  a week and then I got out agai
n."  Thi s wa s not  the  ca se. He re 
if you got caught, that's
 t he end of your li fe. It 's a  deat h 
sent ence. So my mo
ther was Œ and I 
mi ght  sa y one ot her  thi ng. While
 my  father Œ when my  father
 was arrested and he Œ you 
know, he  wa s up i n t he  at tic 
he c a me  down in t he t hey put 
hi m into the  bedr oom wher e my 
mother  was i n t he closet
 i n t he be ginni ng and he  Œ t hey mu
st ha ve l e ft hi m a l one  for ma ybe 
30 sec onds  or so. He t ook off hi s 
ri ng, his wedding band and t hr e
w it i nto t he closet and t hat 
ring I still have to this
 day. That was his wedding band that
 he gave to his 
wife , my mo ther, 
and, and t hat  was  the  onl y t hing t hat  we  sa ve
d. So a fter  they took a
ll the, the loot, they 
couldn't fit it all into their 
car . They took what  they
 could, seal e d t he 
room for the second 
ti me , and sai d t hey would come bac k t he ne xt mor ning. So a fte
r they left, here's my  mo ther 
back in that room, 
s eale d and una ble t o get out . I  decide d at
 t ha t  point  that s he ha d t o get  out. 
Come  hell  or  hi gh water , she  ha d t o ge t out of
 t hat  r oom be cause  she wa s l uc ky twice . Fir st 
in t he closet where they didn't
 see her, then under 
t h e bed wher e they di
dn't see her. This 
will not last for the th
ir d t i me . So ar ound midnight aft er a
ll t he  peopl e ar ound the  vil l age had 
gone home  a nd everyt hing 
wa s quiet , I put a  la dde r  
up a gai nst  t he house .  
 

01: 43: 00  

 

 I went  up on the l adder  and s h
e came  out of the wi ndow and put
 her feet on my  shoulder and 
we  sort of Œ which ever wa y, 
we finally made it do
wnstairs and now where do we  go fr om 
here?  Now t he far mer  ha d a  very, ver y tall  hays
tac k. When I s a y haysta
ck, one of these huge 
haystacks with a roof over it. 
And we  deci ded that we 're  going 
t o go up on the hayst ack a nd 
see where we're going fr om t her
e. We di dn't know what  we'r e 
going t o do. So we cli mbed 
up on t he ha ystac k wit h a  ladder  whic h it  
cert ainl y wa s not  too 
uncomfortable Œ was a 
comfortabl e place  to rel a x ‚til  a bout a  co
upl e of hours l ater  we got  wor d fr om the  
undergr ound that  the Ge s tapo had 
found out t hat t here  were  t w o mo
re Je ws  left i n t he house . 
An d t he  Ges t apo  was  o n their wa
y back to get both
 my  mo the r  an d I .
 Well, withthat 
me ssa ge  in hand, we  had to ma ke  a de cision. 
Wher e we're goi ng fr om 
here?  Here we are in 
the south of Hol l and. We  de ci
de d Œ I  wa s t old als o  by t he 
under ground t hat t he r ailroad 
station of Alrijksdaal was surr
ounded by the  Gest a po. And so
 t here f ore  we coul d not  go 
there . It  was  i mpos sibl e. So 
I kne w
 t h at the next  ra ilroad 
st ation was  furt her  sout h and I  
didn't know exactly how to
 get there but I knew 
i n what ge neral  dire c
tion I  had t o go, so I  
took my  mo ther by hand an
d we walked Œ I wo uld say we
 wa lk ed so me
where in the 
neighborhood of probabl y fi ve 
to six hours through 
the woods and probably
 more than that, 
‚til we finally reached th
e next town at the ra
ilway station. 
And we boarded 
a train and my 
mother  and I  both in the same 
compart ment although we di d not
 sit t oget her  because i f one 
of us got  arr ested we  di dn't  want
 both of us to be arrested. So
 I sat there with
 a newspaper in 
fr ont of me so that my face 
would not show up. My
 mother was sitting on
 the other side of 
the railroad. An d we took off 
and the  next  railr oa d stop wa

window and sure enough, there

Amsterdam.  Wh en I got back to
 Amst erda m, I  got on 
the phone and I  cal le
d my  teacher, the 
onl y pers on I  kne w.  
 
01: 46: 00  

 

 Not  t he onl y pers on I kne w, but 
the  only pers on I kne w who mi ght
 be  a ble t o help us. And I 
called hi m on t he phone and I sa
i d, " Her e we are. This is wh
at  happened. My father was 

arrested. My mot her and I are 
here." An d again without thin
king for one second, he says, 
"Come r i ght over ."  So t hi s 
is 1943. We are wal king cl ear
 acr oss Amsterdam from the 
railroa d stati on and we  wind up 
bac k at Mr . I n 't  Hout 's hous e 
Œ home. Here agai
n, this little 
apart ment  Œ i t 's a city apar t ment.
 We  were t here and we stayed
 in one r oom. My mother a nd 
I stayed in that room for two an
d a hal f  ye ars . Ne ver le ft  the r
oom. Never saw fresh air, it's a 
strange  feeli ng. You know eve n a pri soner i s
 all o we d e ver y day t o exer cis e. We could not  
exerci se. We  were in that room 
and so here we are. Then t he 
foll owi ng year , Mrs. In't Hout 
died. Of natural ca us es, s he die d. And whic h wa
s a  di ffi cult  ti me beca use  now t her e wer e  a 
hundre d pe ople comi ng t o t he 
apar t m ent and nobody was  allowe d 
to know that we  were in 
that little apartment so we stayed
 in that room and so
mehow they put some 
chairs in fr ont of 
the doors  s o that nobody 
would wal k i nto that  r oom wher e we  wer e hidi ng. 

 
Q: Let me ask you this. 
Wha t  was  it li ke  l i ving i n t hat  one
 room?  How di d yo
u keep yours el f 
occ upie d dur ing the  day?  
 

A:  Ver y di ffic ul t. We  di
d get  the  undergr ound ne wspa
per which was called Het Volk
6
, V-O-L-
K. We  re ad t hat. The se were ver y rel i gious 
pe ople . The y were Prot esta nt pe ople  a nd the y 

read a great deal  about  the Ne
w Te stament and the Ol d Te stamen
t and truthfully, I learned a 
great  de al about  the  Old Test a ment  a nd the  Ne w 
t esta me nt. I t ook up 
sketc hing. I got  s o me  
paper and a pencil and I 
did some sketching and I still have 
those sketches. I 
saved them. It's 
very di fficult  and t he n, of cour se, e ver y day we
 were al ways aware. Ev
er y ti me  the door bell 
rang. Every time I heard somebody
 comi ng up t he stairs , not  to
 our  apart me nt, but up the  
stairs in the apart ment hous
e  you coul d hear . You always  
worried. Who is this? Who's 
coming up t he stairs . So we  de
cided to Œ there wa s a closet an
d I  de cide d t o c ut a hole  i nto 
the r oof of t h e cl oset . I  cut a 
hol e, oh, what woul d you c all t h
is? Two feet? It was about two 
fe et. I cut a, cut a hole 
two square feet into th
e attic. And got a 
ladder up ther
e. Looked in 
and there I was in the attic. Howeve
r, so here this is this bare 
attic. And then I saw at the end 
of the attic there was 
a wall, a brick wall.  
 

01: 50: 30  

 

 And what  I did, I t ook a  ha mme
r and a screwdri ver and sl owly 
I took out  bri c k by bric k by 
brick, I t ook out  a s mall  s ection 
of t hat  wall. J ust  a t r iangl e, ju
st big enough a nd every ti me I 
took out  the  brick, I mar k ed t h
e brick with a number on
e , t w o, t hree , four , fi ve, etc . And so 
what happened is when I 
took out he brick you got
 into the next attic 
and there in the next 
attic, when I was in that attic, I 
took the bricks and put
 them back, one, two,
 three, four, fi ve, 
and s o it  al most bec a me  a  soli d bric k wall  a g
ain. And whenever ther
e  was  any ki nd of a  
problem,  my  mother and I wo uld 
go up into this two by two hole, crawl into the Œ crawl into 
that attic, into the anne
x and then put the bricks
 back in again, etceter
a, etcetera. Wh at else 
did we do during?  We ll we Œ I 
must  sa y, just  a bout ever y day we pr actic ed. Practi ce d goi ng 
up ther e, ma king s ure  tha t  we
 knew how to do it, a nd how 
to do it the quickest way. We  
beca me  e xpe rt. I  tell  you we  were  just  expert
s i n cl i mbing up the la dder  a nd goi ng thr ough 
the hol e a nd putti ng ba ck the bric ks , 
I  kne w every brick by, by, by si ght .  
 

01: 52: 00  

 

 And i t  wa s very di ffic ult . Ver y di ffic ul t. Tw
o and a hal f yea rs i n one
 room wi thout leaving 
that room. You, you have a te
ndency of, of Œ you know, you 
c oul d l ose  your mi nd, but  we  
didn't . Then on top of it , of c
our se , all  of Holla nd Œ now t he , 
t h e invasi on of  Holla nd took 
place , t he  invasi on of Europe  took pl a ce i n 
1944. D- Da y, th
at wa s 1944. And the  Amer ican 
forces and the British forces an
d the Canadian fo rces
 so on, they libera
ted every part of 
Europe, including Berlin. Ther
e was one little piece that wa
s not liberated yet. They 
liberat ed Ar nhem. You may r ecal
l  the st ory of the bri dge at
 Ar nhem where the Americans 
lost a tr e mendous number  of 
pe opl e. We ll Ar nhe m, you know, 
t he whol e s out h of Holl and, 
Hol l and i s a  s mall countr y. The 
whol e  southern par t of Holla nd
 was alr eady l i berat ed. We  
were still up to the

Q:  Hot p l ate?  

 

A: We ll, it wasn't  a 
hot plate. There was 
no electricity so 
you put a little stick 
of wood in, but it 
was an ingenious kind of a thin
g. You Œ it was sort of a little, 
little pot with an opening and 
you put a little, little piece of
 wood in. There wasn't much 
wood either, and you just cooked 
this, this pulp, this sugar 
beets. It tasted horri bl

Q: There was something I wanted 
to ask you but I missed it a 
little earlier. Can you tell me 
about the arrest of your fa
ther  by t he  Ge stapo, a nd 
the events following that? 
 

A:  Yea h .  We ll,  as I  me n
tioned t o you my  father wa s a rreste d 
in the summer of 
‚ 42 in the  far m 
house . And he wa s arrest ed. It was in the summ
e r  so he  was  just wear ing hi s usual  s u mmer  
clothes. And he  was  se nt to a  c onc entr atio
n camp  called s™Hertogenbosch, H-E- R- T- O- G-E-
N- B- O- S- C- H.  It  was  a c onc entra tio n ca mp  in  Ho
lland. We haveletter
 fr om him.  We  have 
about a hal f a dozen l etters th
an he s e nt fr om ca mp, not t o
 us, beca use  he
 doesn't know 
where  we were but  he  s e nt it  
to these  two la dies , our neighbor
s  upst airs  and in e ver y l ette r, 
he asked for clothes. He  wa s 
c old. M y fat her  was  a s ort of a s i ckly ma n s l i ghtl y built , 
etceter a, and he stayed t h ere t h
rough t he fall and t h en t he  last  
letter we  received fr om him 
was, I believe, in November. In November he still
 had no clothes and at
 one point he was so 
sick tha t  we  got  a l etter  fr om 
hi m. Wh en I  say ﬁwe,ﬂ again it
's t h e t wo la dies , got  a l etter  
fr om which they forwarded it to
 us where somebody el
se  wrot e in hi s na me
 he wa s too sick 
to write the letter himsel
f pleading for some  warm clothes. 
As it turned ou
t, somewhere i n  
the mont h of Dece mber  he pl us  many other  pe
ople were lined up, we
 found out 
through the 
through t he undergr ound 
later , we re li ned up at t he  railr oad tra c k t here  in s™ Hert ogenbos ch 
and were stripped of all thei
r clothes and were 
put into cattle cars
 stark naked and 
transport ed clear across Ger many.
 To wh ere? Nobody knows.  
 

02: 03: 00  

 
 It is  obvi ous  to me  that he  
ne ver  made it be cause  you c an't be
 naked in a cattl e car  whi ch i s, 
you know, all open fr om 
all si des . And i n t he mi
ddle of Decemb er and no
t die, especially i f 
you are in weakened condition 
already. So I don't know what 
happened to him. I have no 
idea  wher e he di ed. At  le ast my brot her, 
I  kne w  he  die d i n Mauthausen s o t h atŒ 
 
Q:  Let me go ba ck t o

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q:  Ca n you r ec all a ny ot her  storie s 
or events  tha t  occ urred whi l e you
 were in the annex, in that 
attic? 
 

A: Not really. Not mu
ch happened in that  anne
x. We  were there over 
and over  and over  aga in, 
but  it wa s j u st the t w o of us. An
d we  didn't sleep in the annex.
 We  onl y we nt t here  whe r ever  
we  he ard s o met hing whi ch we  felt  was out  of th

some body fa mili ar, we woul d quic k

wa s our  sec o nd hi ding pla ce, so 
to s pe ak and other wis e, we we r e

one  room which c ontai n, contai ned Œ wa s one  of, 
one  of thos e beds t hat
 you pus h up a g ainst  
wh en you don't sleep on it, you 
push up against the wall. So  
we had two beds
 there, and 
there was a little desk and 
two chairs, and that
 was it. That wa

A:  Ye s. You could, except not us.

A:  No. Beca use  everyt hing wa s

02: 06: 00  

 

 I hope  nobody ha s t o go
 through hunger t he  way we  di d. H
unger i s so pai n ful . I  would wake  
up in the  mi ddle  of the night  in
 a col d  sweat  and jump up 
in be d. Why?  Bec a use  I wa s 
drea mi ng I s aw a potato. That

and I t hought I c oul d eat  i t . Whe n

Mr. In't Hout one day,

 He  found them some where on the road. Le

 in the street . The y were j ust t w o plai n 
potat oes . The whole  fa mi ly, we 
were all excited abou
t thos e two potatoes
. You can't believe 
what it  mea n s to be r eal hung

 with e arphones. And I hear d

ﬁ T he gree n c o w j u mps ov

we had in the atti

we had a map of Europe. 
We  had little flags, and 
since we  were able to hear the BBC, we  were 
a bl e to se e how the Ger man ar my first  move d 
east, and finally thank goodnes
s moved back west. And we we
re still Œ I was still under 
occupation when Hitler co
mmitted suicide. We  were 
still under occupation.  
 

Q:  Ca n you te ll me  a bout

A:  Yea h.  Thi s  wa s a bo ut fo ur we eks , fo ur we eks

there were the Dutch Œ like the 
Belgians, like the Fr
ench, like everyb od y,  there was a Nazi 
party. And there were Du
tch people joinin
g the SS and all of that, 
but in ge neral the Dutch 
people  were  very, ver y he lpful . Ve ry helpfu
l . In fact I mi ght  me

brot her  and I  were  arre ste d i n 1941, t h e e ntire  
country of Holla nd we nt on str ike. Ther e was 
no railr oad r unning. Ther e was  no stre et car

entire  c ountr y we nt on str i ke. Under  Ger man

 were under German 
occ upati on. For  a  ha ndful of Je ws. And t hat r

 what happened you

Q:  Ca n you te ll me  what ha
ppened after liberation?  
 

02: 16: 00  

 

A: We ll, after liberation
 we Œ it 's a good que stion. What, 
wh at™ll wh at'll you do? Where'll you 
go. The  fir st place  we  we nt bac k t o our fo
r me r nei g hbors, the t w o la dies  who ha d bee n 
supplyi ng us  wi th our r ati oni ng car ds  duri ng th
e war. And they had go
ne and they had the 
key to our apart ment . And t hey 
had taken out quite a bit of st
uff from the apartment. Th ey 
had ta ken out, for i nsta nc e, my 
bicycl e. And so t he 
most  i mport ant t hing that  I got  whe n I  
got  thr ough t he fi ve  ye ars  of war, I ha d a  bi cy
cl e. And let me  tell you. That  was valuable. 

That 's like here, in Amer ica, 
you ha ve a  car . Wi thout  a car, wh
at are you going to do? How 
are you goi ng t o get around?  Well
, i n Hol l and, I ha d 
bicycle. That all o wed me to do what  I 
had to do. We finally got a r
oom. We  rented a room from a 
lady wh o was a widow and she 
gave us a room for nick
els and dime s. My mother had two 
br ot hers  in Amer ica who ha d left 
Ger ma n y be fore t he  war. One wa s a  doctor . On
e was a lawyer. An d,  an
d they both married 
Ameri can women, and so 
wh en  th e war  fin a lly  wa s over , we  
wrote  to the m and t he y s ent us , 
you know, s o me doll ars  so t hat  we could at 
least buy some  food and so on. The strange 
thing happe n ed. We  were  Œ as  I said we le ft  
Ger ma ny in 1933, a nd we li ve d i n Hol l and all  
these years, you know. We  neve
r became citizens. Not becaus
e you didn't want to become 
citizens but in Holland yo
u did not Œ it was very, 
very, very difficult to 
become a citizen. It's 
not like in Americ
an, after five years you can become
 a citizen. So th
erefore we were 
forei gner s i n  Holla nd. After th
e war, well  the r eac
tion of the Dutch peop
le to the Germans 
was unbelievable. The hate that
 had built up over the years wa
s unbelievable. They wanted 
to tear t hem apart  whenever t h
ey saw a Ger man. They reall y we
r e ready t o tear t hem apart. 
Her e  we  wer e , a fter  the  war, my  mo t h er a nd  I 
had j ust gone  thr o ugh fi ve yea r s of war . The  
next thing we find out 
we're in this little room 
from this lady. Next thin
g we have Œ there is a 
ring on t he door  bell  ri ngs.

Q:  How di d you come  t o t h
e Uni ted State s a ft er you c onta cted your uncle s?  
 

A: We ll, we had actually applied 
in 1938. I n 1938, we  
ha d applied to c o me  to
 the Unit ed St at es. 
And all of t h ose  pa per s ar e als o given to t h

i f t h e war  ha d sta r ted 
instead of in May of 1945, in 
J une of ‚ 45 or  maybe  July ‚45,
 we  wo uld have
 bee n i n t he 
Uni t ed States befor e t he war , but
 the war just broke out before 
we  ha d a c ha nce  to get  there. 
So  in 1945, after the war we
 ha d to go thr ough the  whole  
pr oce dure  a gain a ppl ying for

we  came to the United States in the in the late, 

the l ast  part  of 1945. And I

Q:  How di d Œ how is  it to
 adjust to life  in th

 how did you feel when 
you got  to the Unit ed St at es? 
 

A:  We ll, the  di ffer ence i n li f e st yle, of c o urse , 
is tremendous fr om Europe
 to the Unit ed St at es. 
I ha ppene d t o l ove  it. I , I ,  
I had ma de up my  mind fr om the 
minute I got off

on, the y pur chased ne w s hi ps here  
i n t h e Unit ed St at es and these 
sailors brought the ships back to
 Holland and I wa s on
 t hat  s hi p. And a s 
I got off th

ca me t o t his  country, I ha d I  thi nk I ha d fi ve

wh o came  fr om Europe after the

get here t o t his  countr y. I ha d no money Œ fi ve

 thi n g. When you come  t o t h

I went  fr om Ce ntral  Park to 59t h Stre e t  Œ 59th

So I  took my ne ws pa per under
