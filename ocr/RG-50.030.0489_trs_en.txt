MANFRED GANS 
 November 11, 2004 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Manfred Gans, 
conducted by Amy Reuben on November 11
th
, 2004, in Fort Lee, New 
Jersey. This is tape 
number one, side A. Mr. Gans, would you please 
start by telling me  your full name , a nd where 
and when you were born? 
Answer: Okay, my na me is Manfred Gans. I was bor
n in a little town in West Germany near the 
Dutch frontier, the name  of that town is Borken, it
™s -- at the time  it used to be called Borken in 
We stfarn -- in We stphalia. A
nd I was born in there on the 27
th
 of April, 1922. My father™s family 
had lived in that town at least 
since 1610. The town records showed
 that his -- the fa -- his -- his 
mother™s family, by the name of Wi ndmiller, were 
allowed to live inside the walled city of that 
town in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews gene rally were not allowed within 
walled ci -- cities.  
Q: Do you know why, perhaps, it -- 

A: No, I can -- can™t remember why, exactly wh
at the reason was why -- but -- why they were 
allowed to live there. But basically Je ws had lived
 in that  area, or in that town since so metime -- 
some thing like 1246. The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is 

fully available in the -- in a group that has be
en formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a 
small group of people who have occupied themselv
es with the history of the Jews. And they 
have fabulous documents about everything. So if 
you have to clear up some thing, this is where 
you can go, and anybody who wants to research the s
ubject should go to these 
-- to these people.  
Q: How large a Jewish community wa
s there when you were living there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

A: There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived
 in the town itself. And there were Jewish 
fa milies in every -- all the little village s around 
it. The town was a -- you know, was the county 
seat, and the -- all these other Je
w --  little Jewish communities in 
the vi llages, some  of them had 
their own synagogues, but none of them had school
s. And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p 
-- all the Jewish ch
ildren had to come  to Borke n for the 
Jewish schools. We  -- oh, I had one towa 
-- want to me ntion one more thing which I -- this thir
d thing is very important. So the Jews in a --  
i-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 year
s. And though it was a free town, that me ans it was 
-- it was -- it had -- it was an independent tow
n, which could ma ke its ow
n decisions, my father 
was the only Jew who was ever elected into the 
town council. There have been no Jews before 
that, and no Jews, of course, sin
ce that -- since itch -- there ar e 
no Jews living in the town now. 
Everybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust. 
Q: We ll tell me , if you would, tell 
me  your father™s name , and when was he part of this council, 
and maybe you could tell me a little 
bit more about him, and your mother? 
A: Okay. My father™s name  was Maurice Gans. 
He  was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a -- 
all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- 
in the town, he went into the Je wi
sh school for the first four years 
of his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we 
can calculate when that was. And then, at 

the age of 10, he went into the high school, whic
h actually wa s a larger, Ca
tholic school. And he 
graduated from there at the age of, I think about
 16. He did -- he did not finish up as a full 
matriculation because there -- there was certain st
ages. And from there on s -- from then he -- he 
went into the textile trade, a
nd he was an apprentice in a whol
esale textile ware -- company in 
Frankfurt, i-i-in -- in Germany. He -- when Wo rld Wa r One broke out, he was a -- drafted into 

the German army. He was in Italy, and his unit wa
s continuously short of
 food, and supplies, and 
he ma de it his business to go into the Italian 
towns and get provisions there. And coming back 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
3 
 
 
from one of those expeditions, a -- a -- he was 
shot at by his own people, who hadn™t recognized 
him, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a resu
lt of a big loss of blood, he 
lost a lung, and so he -- 
his whole like -- life from there on, he had only 
one leg, and one lung. He was extremely brave. 
He was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish 
home for recuperation in 
Switzerland because of 
having lost the lung. Of course the -- you know what 
-- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he 
had tuberculosis, which he did not have, and 
there he got involved in founding a Jewish 
recuperation home . I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all 

those -- those things. When he eventually retu
rned to his hometown, he set up his own company, 
and my mother was his partner. Now, ma  -- tell 
you a little bit about my  mother, because she had 
a totally different background. 

Q: Actually, and -- first tell me  when he was elec
ted to the town council, cause you said that was 
such an unusual occurrence. 

A: Yeah, he was -- I think he was elected to th
e town council only in -- either in 1930 -- 1930 or 
™31. Then, of course when -- when the -- when the 
-- there were so ma ny elect
ions just before the 
Hitler peri od, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic part y in town. 
When the social democratic party wa s reduced to 
only one representative in
 the town council, I -- 
my father decided that his non-Jewish soci
al democratic -- wh
at trying to say? 

Q: A colleague of his, or -- 

A: A colleague -- colleague should 
stay, rather than he. And so th
at he was out of it. Now, how 
did he get into this po
sition that people voted for him?  Wh
en he returned to the town, after 
World Wa r One, and set up his own business, he also
 took a very active part 
in the league of war 
orphans, widows. And -- I™m trying to find a -- fi
nd a English wor -- when people who had been 
injured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league lik
e that, and he beca -- soon became the head of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
4 
 
 
that league. He had his st
aff work on all the applications whic
h were necessary so that these war 
orphans, war widows, and people who had -- war in
jured could apply to the various governme nt 
offices for the support to which they were ent
itled. And he never charged anybody for all these 
services, and therefore he  became very, very popul
ar. His st aff was -- his 
office staff, which was 
concerned, of course with wholesale textiles, 
was a-accustomed to service the me mber s of the 
league of war orphans, wi dows, and people who had b
een injured in the war. Oh, I also started to 
tell about my mother™s family, right? My mother™s
 fa mily lived in a little town called Falksen, 
which was near Hannover. And my grandfather, Ma
urice Frankel, had come
 from some where in 
the Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time. 
He had set up his own business, and this is a 
town, he was a total free thinker, didn™t believe 
in organized religion at 
all. But -- and his wife, 
my grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn
™t mean that they were hiding the fact that  
they were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but
 they just didn™t believ
e in organized religion. 
Their ideal were opera, and thea
ter, German [indecipherable] you 
know, that sort of thing. In 
fact, one of the sisters of my 
grandfather was an actress in Ha
nnover, and she was a paramour of 
the king of Hannover. She was very good looking. 
Even I reme mber her, though vaguely. And of 
course, I™ve seen pictures of her. So, it was to
tally different type of 
upbringing, but nevertheless 
my mother also had to go to Hebrew school tw
o or three time s a week, 
in -- this was a town 
called Springer, which was a -- probably only about
 four or five miles away. There -- you know, 
in those days of course there were plenty of trai
ns. They went to and fro by train all the time. So 
she too had a smattering of Jewish education. A
nd then when she finished elementary school, her 
parents sent her to a finishing 
school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially 
ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a 
result my mother was an
 outstanding cook, very 
much oriented towards the French cuisine, whic
h she had learned in -- in Belgium. For a short 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
5 
 
 
while, she actually worked, after the [indeciphe
rable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or 
whatever you call this, in th
e house of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish 
philosopher who -- who -- usually hi
s name  is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was -- 
who was later on a professor in -- in Israel, at 
the [indecipherable] university. Of course, Franz 
Rosensweig was at that time already very sick. 
He  had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while 
he was in the German army in -- in Poland. And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and ve-
very famous  in his interpretation 
of general philos
ophy and Judaism.  
Q: And wha t ™s your -- what was your mother™s name ?  

A: My mother™s name  was Else Fr
ankel. E -- E- l-s-e Frankel. Now -- 
Q: And whe n was she born? 

A: She was, I think, five years younger than my fath
er, so she mu st have be
en what, 18 - 19, yes.  
Q: Sol tell me a little bit about the ho me then, 
that they ha d for you, as you were growing up. Try 
to give me  a picture of what the -- what th
at, you know, how your daily life was like at home, 
and of course, could you me n
tion, you know, the siblings who -- who are your siblings. 
Q: Okay. I only vaguely reme mber the house in 
which we lived during the -- during the first 
three years of my life. That hous
e is not in existence any more
 now, but I know exactly where it 
was, it was near the railway stati
on in Borken. And my parents just rented an apartme nt th-there. 
Now, my father was very successful in business,
 he was a -- always a financial genius. And -- 
and I think in the year 19 -- yeah, ™35, just be
fore my younger brother wa s born, he bought a very 
stately house, just outside the town of Bork
en, which had been built by a ma n who wa s the 
owner of a brick factory once, th-therefore th
ey had -- they hadn™t -- not spared any -- any 
expenses, any bricks, or anything 
like that. That house is still in 
existence now, and it™s still an 
outstanding house, up to the -- up to th
e sis -- da -- this day. And it still has a lot of the features 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
6 
 
 
which it had when we lived in it. At the ti
me  when my parents bought it, and it was not 
developed around it, gradually they, you know, they
 planted trees and bu
shes, and things like 
that. So we had two ma i ds as servants, we had 
people looking after the vegetable gardens, and 
after the flower gardens. And above all, my 
father had a chauffeur, since he couldn™t drive 
himself. He was always on the road for -- during th
e whole week. Usually he came  back at night, 
some ti me s he did not come  back at night, but he
 usually came back at ni
ght and then went out 
again in the morning, into the rural district, to
 sell the specialty text
iles to people who ma ke 
custom clothing. So it -- it -- it -- i -- it wa-was
 certainly upper class. I think we had a higher 
standard of living than anything I have achieved 
since then, or my brothers have achieved since 
then. My older brothe r was called Karl, and he -- 
he was two years olde r than I. He™s still alive 
now, he lives in Israel. Now he™s called Gashom
 Kadar. He™s changed his name  during wor -- 
World Wa r Two, when he was serving in a mi xed 
Arab Jewish unit in th
e British army. And my 
younger brother, his name  was Tayol, and when he 
went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let 
me  see, he went to Israel in 1952. He too changed 
his name  from Gans  to Kadar. I have to excuse 

myself. 

Q: Okay, if you could just continue to tell me
 about your life in your childhood home , and was it 
a very festive life with your fa
mily?  Tell me  a little b
it about the sort of routines that you had, 
you know, as a fa mily, and at home. 

A: We ll the routine obviously was we go to school every da y. Until the age of 10, we  went to the 

Jewish school, Jewish elementary school, where 
we learned both the secular subjects and the 
basic parts of the Jewish servic
e, including the translation of th
e five books of Moses and things 
like that. So w-we had a systematic education in
 learning classical Hebrew
. Then, at the age of 
10, since our parents were well enough to do to --
 they could send us to high school, we shifted 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
7 
 
 
over to the hi gh school. Now, th -- the routine at 
home was that we™d all be in school until about 
one o™clock and then came  home and had the -- 
the ma in me a l  of the 
day. In the afternoon we 
were supposed to do our home work. 
Had some sort of other activitie
s, we  were essentially free. 
And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it™s
 -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. Not -- 
we wouldn™t call this strictly 
Orthodox, call it like the modern Or
thodox in the United St ates now 
here. And Friday evenings we would go to the se
rvice. After the service 
there would be a very 
festive meal. My -- my fa ther would be hom
e most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the 
weekends. Saturday morning we would go to 
synagogue again. The synagogue would finish at 
about half past 10, 11 o™clock. We  then would go 
home  and have a very fe stive breakfast, and 
after that  we were obligat ed to
 go and visit our grandmother, my father™s mother, who was living 
in town. And at that time she was beginning to 
be about 75 - 80 years old. And we had to visit 
her every Saturday. And after that we™d go b
ack to synagogue for the afternoon service, a -- 
which was at about one o™clock, an
d about two o™clock was the ma in
 me a l , and in the evening at 
the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we
 would again go to syna
gogue and participated 
what™s called the Havdalah service. So, it was a 
-- a life that  revol-revolv
ed largely around the 
Jewish religion. On Sunday we had to go to 
Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to 
Hebrew and Jewish history. The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight 
grades in it. Of course, we who 
-- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the 
high school only stayed in it for four years. But 
there were people -- Jewi
sh kids in the school 
who -- whose parents could not afford to send 
them to high school, and 
who did all the eight 
grades in the -- in the one room school, this 
was a one room sc hool. Which was very interesting 
because it -- it almost was like self education. Th
ere was only one teacher, and h-he would attend 
to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. But 
when he taught history, or when he taught 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
8 
 
 
some thing to some body else, of course you could al
ways listen in. And I think [indecipherable] 
that was very, very good for our development. That™s
 in my -- in my days, the name  of that first 
teacher we ha d, his name  was Gunsberg, and he became an outstandi ng person in the 
[indecipherable] s-service, or 
[indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally em-
emigrated to Israel, some  time before World Wa r Two. 

Q: When you started the high 
school, tell me  what age you we re when you started the high 
school, and were your friends at
 the high school only Jewish, or
 did you have also non-Jewish 
friends?  

A: We  started high school at the age of te -- 10. 
Before the Hitler period, we mi xed fairly freely. 
Not hundred percent te -- hundred 
percent freely, but fairly free
ly with everybody. And there was 
not much of a distinction ma de between Je
ws and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate 
very easily with everybody else. In 
my case, of course, this only la
sted for one year. And then in 
1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. But in the case of my older brother, this 
state of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. My
 cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the 
oldest amongst all of us who was at that time , 
he must have been alr
eady about 16 or 17, he had 
gone through that whole school, and 
of course had been totally inte
grated into the class in which 
he was. So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not 
mu ch -- there wa s not much distinction ma de, but 
there -- there -- there was -- al
ways was a certain amount of 
anti-Semitism. And the really 
wealthy families in town, non-Jewi
sh wealthy families did not mi x with Jews, basically. So there 
were certain -- 

Q: Did you reme mber feeling anti-Semitism in sc
hool before -- before Hitler came  to power? 
A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes. Fi rst of all, it wa
s already 1932, the Nazi move me nt was already very 
active, and certain -- let™s say parents of certain
 -- of children have -- 
were already very active 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
9 
 
 
Nazis. And they already came out with some  obj
ections to Jews. It di
dn™t -- it wasn™t very 
serious, and we didn™t take it very
 serious, and we  also had -- 
always had already answers to 
everything. We always fought back. 
Q: What would you say? 

A: We ll, some  of the [indeci
pherable] I reme mber some body 
say to him -- said to me , you 
Godda mn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you 
know, Jewish nose?  And I 
said better -- I said 
it™s much better than having a bird in your br
ain like you do. I said -- that™s the German 
expression for -- for being a nut, is to have, you know
 -- so -- but it -- it more or less stopped 
there.  

Q: Did you ever feel, you know, physically harassed, or -- 

A: We ll now, are you talking about f -- 
before Hitler, or after Hitler? 
Q: First before. 

A: Before Hitler, I don™t -- 
I don™t think -- I personally 
had no encounters of physical 
harassment. Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I 
don™t think it was very common to have physical 
harassment before Hitler. 

Q: Would you say -- can you tell me how large 
the overall town was, how ma ny people lived 
there, and was it -- would you say it was pretty 
good relations in genera
l between the Jewish 
community and non-Jews? 

A: The town had 8,000 in habitant s, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in 

it. The relationships were, I think, pretty good. There were, of course, very Jewish businesses, 

and there were certai n people who were anti-S
emitic, who were  just avoided. You just didn™t 
con-contact them. Of course, th
e -- the point of our town with
 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody 
knows everybody. You couldn™t hi de. But by and larg
e, I think it was a pr
etty peaceful life.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

Q: Now before we get to the time  when Hitler co
me s to power, can you give me  just a very brief 
snapshot, the personalities of 
your family me mbers; your mom,
 your -- your father, and your 
siblings. Just give me  a sense of, you know,who they -- who they 
are, and -- and their 
personalities. 
A: We ll, my  father was the -- was very, very re
spected by -- by us. He was our greatest friend, 
and w-we three sons had a extremely good re
lationship with him when he was home .  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 

Manfred Gans. This is tape number one, side 
B. If you could continue to tell me  -- you were 
starting to tell me about your mother. 

A: My mother, of course, had a hard job educ
ating three sons, and no daughter. And she was -- 
could be quite volatile at times, and put on quite
 so me  scenes when we
 wouldn™t go along with 
what she preached. And w-we could at time s fo
r m a united front against her, and she would 

complain like hell to my father, who w-would get 
very upset about it, when he heard about it. 
But -- and I don™t want to underestimate the fact th
at, of course, my mot her was in the afternoon 
in -- in my father™s business, and we were some
what educated by the maids we had in the house, 
too. We  had two ma ids, as I said before, and we 
had other se-servants, a
nd that had some sort -- 
quite a bit of influence on us, too. Which I suppo
se is the usual experience of people who have 
grown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there we
re servants. My older brother was -- he was 
very much the intellectual. He we -- he -- 
he was what you called a bookworm. And he -- he 
loved reading, and it came -- ca me  -- c-came  in ve
ry handy later on. I can go into the fine details 
afterwards. And my younger brother, he was out
standingly good looking. 
So -- and my mother 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
11 
 
 
always said that I™m -- I was her 
only s -- d-daughter. I had to lear
n all the practical skills. I had 
to do all the stuff in the kitchen, helping and so 
on, so forth. My -- my older brother was shielded 
from that -- he was quite awkward, too, that™s
 because he was so bookish. My younger brother, 
of course, was spoiled like hell because he wa
s so good looking, and so I had to have all the 
practical skills to -- to help
 everybody. So those -- those we
re the personalities, and they 
some what rema ined that way all our lives, too.  
Q: So tell me  now about Hitler comi ng to power. 

A: We ll, of course it wasn™t a -- it was not 
unexpected. There had been so ma ny elections, and 
every election Germany was going further and furt
her to the right. More 
and more people were 
voting for Hitler, or voting for the 
right wing parties, some  of whic
h were eventually merged into 
the Nazi party. Another thing, a
nother point I have to point 
out why all this was not so 
unexpected. When we visited my grandparents in 
Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- in a 
town that wa s largely Protestant. And that town was very radi cally in with the Nazi be fore Hitler. 
So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we
 went visiting there, there were a lot of kids 
who didn™t pl ay with us because we were Jews. A
nd they were already converted. So it™s a -- a -- 
th-they -- this is where the indic 
-- these were the indications of 
things changing. This a -- well, I 
never forget the day Hitler came to power. We  we
re having lunch, and we were listening to the 
radio, which was on because we listened to the one o™cloc k ne ws. And the newscast came  out, 
and then suddenly the announcer sa
id, ﬁAnd here is a little me ssage
, which has just fallen on my 
desk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has 
appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of -- 
as the next  chancellor of the German state.ﬂ A
nd I reme mber my mother was very, very shocked 
to hear this, and some how we took 
it and said -- said well, that 
wa -- this was just one of the 
things we had to face. The full implication of it,
 we ll I suppose we didn™t ful -- fully realize -- at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
12 
 
 
the time  the kids didn™t, but my mother obvi
ously did. My father was not home . I can™t 
reme mber whether he came  home that night. Bu
t soon -- he certainly came home very soon after. 
Now -- things changed in school now very -- I woul
d say very rapidly. There -- some  of the cra -
- o -- some  of our classmates were keen to jo
in the Hitler youth. There wa
s no Hitler youth in our 
town, and every time  they had a demonstrati
on, they had to call out the high school, which 
included us, for all their -- their demonstration, an
d whatever they were ce
lebrating at the time. 
Eventually my father got us out of there, we di
dn™t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- 
what do they call it?  It™s called 
in German [indecipherable]. Had 
the torchlight parades and all 
that sort of things. We  didn™t have to go -- go al
ong with that any more, but in the beginning we 
did, because the school just said everybody come  t
onight, there™ll be a torchlight  parade to 
celebrate this, that, and the 
other. And so we had to go. 
Q: Now did you always feel and know that youwere against this, even though you had to be 

there? 
A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no ident
ity cris -- crisis. That, I think is the advantage 
of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. My
 father™s father had come from Holland to 
marry my -- marry my gr andmother. And he ha
d grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland, 
though he was not Sephardic himself. In fact they
 were from t he part of Holland that borders on 
Germany. And -- but he -- he was 
-- he was very much aware of
 the Sephardic experience. And 
every time  the word Spain was used, he spit. 
I didn™t know him personally any more. He -- he 
died in 1917. He had a hernia [indecipherable]
 there was mi sop -- mi s-operation, unfortunately. 
And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware 
of the fact that expulsi
on, flight, and all that 
sort of things was part of the Jewish tradi
tion. And there were two Jewish fa milies living in 
town, who had come  from either Poland or Russi
a, and who had been exposed to this whole 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
13 
 
 
business of pogroms, and -- and ma  -- Jewish pe
rsecution in the east. So again, everybody was 
Orthodox, so just was pa rt again -- was accepted as
 being pa rt and pa rcel of one™s hi story. We  
had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came.
 People find that hard to
 believe, particularly 
I -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lo
t of Jews, who f -- Germa n Jews, who were not 
brought up Orthodox, who had all so
rts of clashes, including 
the -- the people who -- when 
some one wa s in the army, and people [indeciphera
ble] working professionally, and who had -- 
who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity 
crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to 
power, and when they were excluded from the soci
al life which they had 
practiced up to that 
time. But as I said -- of course, the other point wa
s we couldn™t socialize th
at well with other pe -
- with non-Je ws, even before Hitler, because we 
were kosher, and we couldn™t eat in their homes. 
And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of
 them would come  to our homes, and eat with us. 
As one of my schoolma tes told me  back in -- 
in the 1988 -- 1992, when I we
nt back to -- to the 
ha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- 
we -- homes  were not that comfortable in those 
days, and we all were friends because  we played
 on the street. So the -- the intima cy that one 
now can experience in being in ea
ch other™s home, we had -- we di
d not have that in any case. 
Q: So did you start to experience mo re restrictions
 at school?  And also w
ho -- tell me a little bit 
about the composition of -- of the student body 
at school. I think you s-said in your me moirs 
mostly Catholic, but tell me a little bit about that. 
A: Yeah. The -- of course the town was largely 
Catholic, and most of our classmates before 
Hitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth move
ment. That was the standard thing to do, for 

everybody to belong to the Cathol
ic youth move me nt. That of c
ourse we -- we were already 
automa tically excluded. We did not, at that time
, have a Jewish youth moveme nt to which we 
belonged, but we did later on. Now, all these -- of
 course, now the pressure became very strong 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
14 
 
 
on all these me mbers of the Cat
holic youth move me nt to change
 over to the Hitler youth, and 
most of them did, eventually. It took a little whil
e for everybody to go along that line, but this is -
- this is where they went, eventually. And our
 attitude to them was you are wrong and we are 
right. Well, it™s a -- things came to a head on th
e first of April, 1933. Now, this was only what, 
three months after Hitler came to power?  He come  to power  on the 13
th
 of January, 1933. The -- 
they started this boycott move me nt against Jewi
sh businesses. And it was a Saturday, and there 
were storm troopers in front of 
every Jewish business to ma ke su
re that people wouldn™t buy at -- 
in Jewish shops. And w-we of course had to go 
to school on Sa turday, we didn™t write, we didn™t 
ca-carry our satchel beca
use we were Orthodox, but we had to
 go to school and listen to the 
school classes. And while we were in school, the 
-- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted 
teachers, [indecipherable] was truste
d most, came and called us out, and 
he said -- he said to us, I 
reme mber there were four Jewish boys in my grade, ﬁLook, you know wha t ™s happening to you. 

I think it™d be safer for you to go home now.ﬂ S
o, when we went home, and well, you know, this 
-- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. Course our parents were -- I 

won™t say shocked, but they were stunned. And my
 father wasn™t going to take it. So he 
imme diately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, 
he got on the telephone to the headma ster of 
the school, and he says, ﬁHey, what™s happening
?  I™m not going to send my
 children back to the 
school if you can™t guaran
tee their safety.ﬂ I am convinced th
at that headma ster then had to 
contact all the necessary party lin
es. I don™t think there was a Gesta
po in this town yet, at that 
time. I was very much aware of the Gestapo when 
it finally came, because of course, they -- they 
-- later on, at the outbreak of 
World War Two, they took over our 
house as Gestapo headquarters. 
But I™m sure he -- he couldn™t give my father a dir
ect answer, he had to squa
re this away with all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
15 
 
 
the authorities. Anyhow, by Monday morning he told 
my father that all the Jewish students could 
come  back to the high school, and they 
could guarantee their -- our safety. 
Q: How did you feel personally? We re you 
getting worried, as -- as a youngster? 
A: Not in the least. Not in the least fo
r it. They were wrong, we were right.  
Q: Do you want to take a short break? 
A: Yeah, I have to get my me dicine. 

Q: Okay, if you want to continue
 telling me  recollections of -- 
of this early period when the 
Nazis came. 

A: So that was April first, and the next lightning 
bolt struck on May first. Of course May first is 
always celebrated in -- in Eu
rope by all labor unions and peop
le who have anything to do with 
labor, you know, which the Nazis th
ought they were -- were too. Th
is was a big celebration. And 
of course there again, we had to have a -- a para
de, and again, since there 
was no Hitler youth, so 
we -- we ha-had to collec -- come  together 
again. There wasn™t a big demonstration, but we 
suddenly -- one of the teachers came  out with a sw
astika emblem, which showed that he™d been -
- been a me mber of the Nazi party for quite aw
hile. I don™t know whethe
r it was true. There™s a 
long history attached to this character. He wa
s a dis -- teacher of ma
the matics, bio -- and 
particularly of biology, and he eventually was 
charged with teaching th
e signs of a racist, a 
subject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis 
had thought out. Anyhow, on May first it turned 
out, he -- he came out with a swastika emble m on 
his coat, which showed that he had been a long 

time me mbe r  of the Nazi party. 

Q: And you -- you witnessed this
 yourself, this was -- 

A: Yes, yes, yes. I have a long history with th
is ma n, who of course now, by now he™s dead. But 
he was an invalid. I can™t reme mber from what a
ny more, but he -- he -- he
 walked av -- one of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
16 
 
 
his legs wasn™t functioning properly, so he was ne
ver called into the war, he stayed in the town 
through the whole war period, and as
 I said, I had quite a history 
with this char
acter. Anyhow, 
now m- my older brother, who d
ecided that we should not communi
cate with our classmates any 
more. We  -- we shouldn™t wait. He was -- my older 
brother wa s the sort of leader of the Jewish 
kids. My cousin, who as I said, who was about at
 that time was 16 - 17 years old. When he died 
last year he -- in New York. He was -- he -- he  wa sn™t in school any more, anyhow, so my older 

brother became the leader of the Jewish child
ren, and he decided that we™re not going to wait 
until we™re excluded, we™re going to separate ourselves. So fro m that time on was -- we did not 

communicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in
 the -- in the a -- in the periods between 
lessons. We ll -- we -- communication was absolutely
 at a -- at a mi nimu
m. You know, without 
any degree of intimacy between them and us. So, and this how I went to school for five years. 

My older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was 
three years later, and we
nt to, at that time , 
Palestine, Israel. And so he was out, and so ot
her Jewish children were 
taken out of school and 
sent abroad, or didn™t continue 
high school. Emigrated and gone [i
ndecipherable]. So eventually, 
by the time -- by the time I left , there -- ther e were
 only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in 
the school, in the high school. 

Q: Did you feel -- what about the Nuremberg la
ws?  Did you and your fa mily feel repercussions 
also? 

A: Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were
 concerned meant that we couldn™t have any non-
Jewish ma ids any more. We then ma naged to 
get some  ma ids  whose 
nationality -- we-were 
Dutch by nationality, you know, it™s in
 a -- in a fr-frontier area like 
that wa sn™t that difficult to 
find. But that was the na -- the ma jor effect it ha
d -- had on us. I am not aware of any other of 
these, you know, ma nife stati
on of the Nuremberg laws.

Q: What about your father™s business? 
A: My father reduced his business considerably, 
and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his 
efforts on getting cash out of Ger many. And he
 set up a new business which sold vacuum 
cleaners, and irons, and you know, fo
r -- for pressing clothing, things
 of that nature, because he 
saw a chance to do business of that nature, to 
get a lot of his money out
 of Ger many, which of 
course, was illegal. There were scheme s of that
 nature. I know my uncles had had scheme s of 
that nature. My father™s brothers who were -- a
ll of them were doing very well financially. And -
- and including my father™s best friend, who b
ecame my fathe r-in- law later on, he too had a 
scheme  of this nature, and this is how peopl
e who had money ma naged to get some  of their 
possessions out of the country, some
 of their cash out of the count
ry. It™s -- it™s a complicated 
way of doing it. Might be interestin
g to investigat e it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk 
about it in great detail here. 

Q: Do you -- do you know at least where, in
 general, he was sending the money? 
A: Yeah, to -- largely to Holland. And he -- he we nt
 to Holland very frequently. He had a cousin 
in Wi nterswijk who cooperated w
ith him. And I don™t know all the 
details about it -- it -- but 
there -- there always was some 
money available for us. He bought 
a house in -- in 
Israel in the 

early stage, when he -- he went on a trip to Is
rael, I think in -- firs
t time  in 1936, or 1937, and 
you know my -- of course my older brother was 
there, and he obviously had to pay for the 
school, my brother went to Ben Shemen together w
ith all the -- a lot of the fa mous leaders of -- 
o-of -- a lot of the men who became th
e famous leaders later on in Israel. 
Q: Tell me -- 

A: Including -- in -- and amongst these -- his clas
smates were people like Rabin and Dayan. So 
he -- so, as I said, money was available fr
om -- for him to attend these schools.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

Q: Tell me  what were -- what were the conversat
ions like within your family, and at home ?  What 
were you talking about now?  Your father™s busin
ess was changing, the changes at school. What -
- what kind of conversations at home? 
A: Interesting question. Was a -- what were we 
-- what were we talking about?  We ll, I don™t 
think the subjects changed that dr-drastically. My
 parents were still very
 much interested in 
literature, talking about s-sub -- 
subjects of culture. And they -- 
they did occasionally discuss 
what we should and should not do, and what we
 should and should not say in public. And -- and 
if you had to be cautious and all 
that. At a very early stage of 
1933, of course they came and -- 
the police and the storm troopers came into our hous
e, and they went through my father™s library, 
but they weren™t -- weren™t enough educated to ev
en find the books that -- that were of dubious 
background. So my mot her, too, ha
d no -- absolutely no fear of th
ese people. So I call them a 
bunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers. 

And I™m sur e they -- my parents are not afraid
 of them and not hing clos
e to -- very radically 
happened. But my father was in the -- interesti
ng point, my fa ther was in the town council. He 
had advocated that the high school for girls,
 which only had 50 stude
nts in it, should be 
combined with the high school of boys. Now, of c
ourse, in a Catholic town
 that was out of the 
question. My father had always based this on th
e huge expense the 50 student school was for the 
town to support, and they said
 there should -- there should be a 
combination of that. Well would 
you believe that within two months after the 
Nazis came to power, they combined the two 
schools?  My father was away, I think in Hannover 
at the time, and my mother -- I remember my 
mother telling him on the telephone that this has 
happened, but of course she didn™t say it direct 
because the telephones were probabl y listened 
to. But she said -- she used some  Jewi sh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
19 
 
 
expression to -- to ma ke him aware of that th
is was -- was happening. Finally his scheme  was 
being translated into reality. So from one da
y to the other we had 
girls in the class.  
Q: Now, wa s your -- was your life a-aside from 
not interacting with non-Jewish students at 
school, were there other things about your daily life that really
 changed, or was it largely the 
same  as -- as before? 
A: It was largely the same as before, except that
 [i ndecipherable] we cou -- we couldn™t show our 
faces any more at spor ts events, you know?  You 
know, these sort of sports events that are 
organized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. 
There was a certain amount of exclusion there, 
and that it got worse. But ther e were -- ther e 
were classes to teach 
aircraft design in the 
afternoon, which I participated in and I™m sure we 
were allowed to particip
ate in. So it™s -- i-it 
didn™t change too drastically, ex
cept now, the other thing was of
 course that now we had a 
different teacher, who was very, very keen to -- 
to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different 
teacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary schoo
l, and he was very, very keen that we should go 
into much -- to greater depths in
 -- in Hebrew. And eventually we 
went to Hebrew classes. Now, 
I™m talking about modern Hebrew speaking clas
ses, every -- every day, except Friday. Every 
afternoon we had Hebrew classes. So that -- that 
was a radical change. And of course it did us a 
lot of good, and -- because go 
-- got us much into greater depths
 into Hebrew. This teacher, who 
also later on was -- became  the headma ster of 
the Mizrachi high school in
 Tel Aviv, he started 
the -- also the [indeciphera
ble] move me nt to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a 
little bit of a organization whic
h was -- through which we met ot
her Jewish kids from other 
towns occasionally, and so we were -- became th
e me mbers of the Mizrachi. Now it™s a national 
religious party, but it wasn™t as
 radical as that in those days
. The youth mo veme nt, and we were 
part of that.

Q: So this was still in Borken, and was this a Zionist group? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zi
onist -- Zionist group. That must
 have started round about 1934 or 
so, because my older brother was st ill in town 
when we started it, and he became one of the 
motivators of it. And as I said before, he left in 
™35, I think, to go to Israel
. So that -- that was 
another connection which we had --

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Manfred Gans. This is tape number two, side A.  

A: My mother™s sister had gone to the Jewish ag
ricultural school near Hannover, as -- when she 
had finished elementary school. And there she me
t the man whom she eventually married, Alex 
Mo. And who was one of the teachers in the schoo
l. And both my uncle, Alex Mo, and my aunt, 
spend all their lives until they emigrated from Ge
rmany, being in charge of agricultural training 
schools for Jews. Now, in 1932, I think it was, I sp
ent a summer in the school which they ran at 
the time , which was near Berlin, it wa s called Gutw
inkle, and we somewhat participated a little 
bit in the work they did, and ma  -- we were re
warded for it. But then, in 1933, they took over a 

very large, what we called a hashavah camp, 
a cultural traini ng camp for Jews who were 
changing professionally to agricult
ure. [indecipherable]. And I spent almost every summer there, 
until I left Ge rmany. And this of cour se, it was 
a fantastic influence on all our lives. We -- we 
loved the ti -- to go there. Since 
my uncle was in charge, we had, of course, a lot of privileges. 
One of the m was that we did a lot of horseback
 riding, and s-systemati
cally learned horseback 
riding from one -- one of the teachers who was th
ere, non-Jewish, who had been in the German 
army cavalry. My uncle hims elf,
 who rode around all the time, 
supervised the work that was 
being done in the fields by these 
trainees, who were changing fr
om all sorts of profession over 
into agriculture. And to a child 
this was an absolutely i -- ideal 
way of -- of living. We -- I have 
interest stories of the -- of the 
life we led there, and it was a -- 
a [indecipherable] connected with 
the work and play, and it was a 
terrific experience. And I had -- 
it™s of -- very much s et the 
atmosphere, both for my brothers and for my
self, as to wh-where we wanted to go 
professionally, eve-eventually. Some  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
22 
 
 
Q: How did it -- how did it 
establish your direction? 
A: We ll, my  uncle thought well, of -- you know, he
 -- he put -- put us into
 whatever we wanted 
to do, and was -- wherever we could be used. We
 -- in the mo rning we always worked, and he 
soon found out that I was very, very handy, so he 
assigned me  to the repair shop which they had 
there. And that sort of set me  on my  -- on my 
aim to become an engineer for repairing -- for 
agricultural machinery. I played around already at 
that  time a little bit with the idea of becomi ng 
a chemical engineer, but it was -- there was 
-- everybody said you can™t do that without doing it 
full time. And I always felt that I would never ha
ve the money to go to a full time university. So, 
there -- that was, of course, my idea, and I™ve 
already me ntioned, my older brother went to an 
eke -- went to Israel, went to Ben Shemen, which 
was the agricultural school in --  in Israel. So 
that set his life, too. And my younger brother, he -- when he finished school in -- in England, 
eventually he also took up -- there was a -- a job in
 -- in agriculture, and stayed in that field all 
his life. He later on became  a specialist of fert
ilizers and things of th
at nature. So all our 
directions we re set by this agri
cultural experience, which we ha
d in the training schools run by 
our uncle and a-aunt. 

Q: And this is when you
™re a teenager, right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  about your Bar Mitzva
h during this time  of your life? 
A: We ll, Bar Mitzvah to us was not a big deal
 really, because we knew so much Hebrew, and 
learned so much. And my older brother was Ba
r Mitzvahed in 1933, yeah ™33, that™s right. And 
at the time -- at the time my -- my mother™s father
 had just died. So my parents didn™t -- for that 
reason, and also because the Hitler
 business, did not want to ma
ke a huge  Bar Mitzvah for him. 
But, you know, he had a f -- it was a very nice Ba
r Mitzvah and all that sort of thing. Very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
23 
 
 
luxurious, but it was ke pt  relatively small. Y
ou know, we had a huge fami ly because my -- my 
grandmother had five boys and five girls. And we
 al -- and they all ma rried, and they all had 
kids, you know, so th -- wa -- it was some wh -- some
what resented by all thes
e relatives that they 
-- they weren™t --  the invitations were relativel
y kept to a small [indecipherable]. Now, by the 
time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1930 -- it™s 22 and 13 is
 35, right?  Yes, that™s
 right. ™33 to thir -- 
yeah, ™35. By the time  I was Bar Mitzvahed in 
1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with 
all the trimmi ngs on it, and of course people comi
ng to our town, they had to be fed three times 
on a s -- Saturday, you know?  On Friday nights,
 on Saturday morning, and s -- then some how 
again some thing -- some thing again in the aftern
oon. We  were expected to do the whole Torah 
reading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty 
to me  at all. And we were expected to do the 
whole reading from the prophe
ts, the Haftorah readings for the day. Again, no -- no -- no 
particular -- wa -- and we were expected to ma
ke a speech. And I ma de a f -- apparently ma de a 
speech which upset my parents very much, 
because I -- politically it was unwise. 
Q: Why is that? 
A: We ll, yeah, I think I started off by saying we 
are being accused of -- of such and such, and 
such and such things now, and I™ll teach you that 
this is totally against our laws, and that we 
couldn™t be like this. Andso it™s a so -- so anyhow -- 

Q: So your -- your speech actually had to 
do with the political climate and the time s? 
A: Yes, yes. But you know, the speech was ma de at home, not in the synagogue. And the 

servants of course that were around, were non-Je
ws, who served the meal
s, so -- I don™t think 
that my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- 
non-Jewish friends to a
ny of these occasions.  
Q: What were your favorite 
Jewish holidays growing up?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
24 
 
 
A: Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover. Best f
ood. You know, cause of my 
mother, being such a 
fabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- we re
 on a -- on a scale that wer -- was gour -- real 
gourme t eating. I mean, even the -- you know, that 
we -- we of course did not eat meat on the 
nine days before Tisha B™Av. But it was wonderful
, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of 
this world. No meat in it, and this being su
mmer, you know, you have all the fruits you want. 
And she ma de the most fantastic fruit soups, 
and vegetable soups tha 
-- vegetable dishes, 
anything you could think of. And this way it was no 
hardship at all. The only hardship was that 
we also couldn™t go swimming in those -- in thos
e nine days. And in the summer, you know?  So 
we were waiting for Tisha B™Av to be gon -- be gone
 so we could go back to the s -- to the swim 
baths, you know, go swimming.  
Q: That remi nds me  of s o me thing you wrote in
 your me moirs about the pool in -- in the 
community. Can you tell me  about 
that during this time period? 
A: Yeah, actually it™s a -- the -- 
the -- the pool was not forbidden to us, except for certain times. 
They had to, you know, there was sort of a mi xtur
e between Ca tholic and Nazi. They had periods 
[indecipherable] was wome n only, a nd -- where wo
me n wer e  allowed. Those periods we did not 
-- we were not allowed to go into the swimmi
ng pool, the town swi mmi ng pool. But then they 
also had periods when the -- the pool was open to
 me n only, a nd those periods -- in those periods 
we could still sneak in and take a swim. So we 
ha d to be carefully attuned to what could and 
what could not be done. 

Q: Was there any rule at all that said 
that Jews could not swim in that pool? 
A: Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not co
mplete exclusion. The exclusion was only for the periods when 
wome n wer e  allowed, or mi xed sw
imming was allowed. So we ma nage
d to ge -- to gets -- to 
sneak in still. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
25 
 
 
Q: Were there any other places in town
 where you weren™t actually allowed? 
A: They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only 
one movie house in town, and that put up a sign 
fairly soon saying we don™t want any Jews, Jude
n [indecipherable]. And when that sign went up, 
my parents would not allow us to go in any mo
re because this is -- you know, that -- that was 
that.  
Q: So it™s not like you tried, 
you just decided not to go? 
A: We  decided that -- not to go, yeah. I thi
nk if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have 
objected very much. 

Q: And wha t  about any recollect
ions of Nazis in -- in your
 town, did you ever have any 
encounters yourself? 

A: Oh yeah. Violent, too. I mean, it started to 
get dangerous to -- to wa
lk in the -- i -- you know, 
in the very beautiful woods 
around that town. You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for 
a walk, and sha -- would want to play, and ther
e were certain guys who 
-- who it was dangerous 
to meet. And they were beating us up and God 
knows what. That™s -- we had to be very, very 
careful. 

Q: Did this actually happen 
to you, or mostly to others? 
A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Once a guy hit me  in 
the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do 

you call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an
 injury from it for quite awhile. And there 
was another, you know, usually it was 
just beating up, or stones bei
ng thrown, and things of that 
nature. You just had -- had to be very, very 
careful. And you just -- nothing you could do. You 
had to recognize that there was superior fo
rce on the other side. You don™t stand and fight 
superior force. You just have to flee from
 it, go into an area where gro -- you have enough 
grown-ups who would interfere with
 what these kids were doing.

Q: So now tell me  about what -- what happe
ned -- what leads up to you going to England. 
A: Actually, my parents wanted to get me  into
 a Jewish high school in Berlin in 1938. On -- on 
one of the many trips to this farm, that training 
farm which my  uncle and aunt -- aunt were in 
charge of, I had to -- come  to know
 two of these schools. They had 
to -- they had come to visit 
the farm, and I was there. I got very, very friend
ly with some  of the teachers, and some  of the 
kids. And as a ma tter of fact I went to one of 
the schools, and well, for a day or two in Berlin, 
and listened in, and from -- and 
then my parents said in 1938, th
at I should leave the school in 
our hometown and go to one of those schools. And 
it was decided that sin
ce all these schools are 
very far adva nced in teaching English, I will ne
ed enough English to ca -- catch up with the ot her 
me - me mbers of the school. 

Q: What languages did you 
know already at this point? 
A: We  had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, 
of course, which we did not learn in public 
school, our education was Latin. We  -- we -- ever
 since we we re 10 years old, every day we 
learned -- had at least one or 
two hours of Latin. Latin was 
the foundation of our -- of our 
knowledge. Now, I learned some  English, I learne
d some  Fre nch, but certainly not -- not to a 
very high degree. Anyhow, my parents wanted to 
send me to England for the summer, and -- to 
learn English, and then I -- I would come  back
 to -- to -- to Ge rmany. But  while I was in 
England, my  parents wrote saying that they have 
talked with other people
, and they™ve come  to 
the conclusion that it™s not wise for me  to go ba
ck to Germany. And they said what would you do 
if we were tell you, you just 
stay where you are. So -- 
Q: And wha t  did you feel about that? 

A: Wonderful. I was free. I had -- I had ma de fri e
nds, again thr -- through my
 relatives with other 
f-family where the gentleman was very active in 
the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell. And I went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
27 
 
 
them, and I told them that -- what my parents 
had written, and -- and wh
at should I do? And we 
decided that the thing to do was, 
since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial  
college, and try and do me tric, you know, high 
school cer -- equivalent to a high school 
certificate, in that fashion. And 
I -- I loved the idea to do this. 
Q: Now tell me  when is this, how old are you, an
d what kind of ma jor experience is this for you 
at this time , because you™re pretty young. 
A: Yeah. This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, an
d -- I liked the idea of 
trying to make it in 
about four or five months, to try and get -- get a 
equivalent of a high schoo
l certificate, and then 
go and start working. Since I knew exactly what I 
wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I 
would go on and learning in -- in evening classes.
 I didn™t have any doubts as to what to do, and I 
like -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my ow
n. Now my par e nts didco
me over occasionally, my 
father or my mother, or both of them, during all 
this time when I first came to England, and -- 
until the outbreak of the war.
 They -- on and off t here, they were in Engl and. 
Q: Wa s it easy for you to leave, and 
also for them to travel like that? 
A: It was very easy for me  to leave, because we a
ll had been living so close to the frontier, we all 
had passes to cross the frontier. It took a long wh
ile to get a passport wh
-which could take me  
past the frontier areas of Holland. But we -- we -- 
we all passports at the time . One more thing, 
already at that age, I had learne
d to dr ive the car. My father wa
nted me  to do that in case we 
suddenly had to get out in the mi ddle of the night
. So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally 
illegal, I knew how to drive a car
 already. And I -- I left hom
e on a Friday afternoon, Friday 
morning, I crossed the frontier, went to my c -- my
 father took me  to his cousin, I stayed there 

for the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to 
Hoek van Holland, took th
e night boat over to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
28 
 
 
England, and arrangeme nts had b
een ma de by my parents for me
 to live temporarily with a 
fa mily, a very nice family in -- in London. 
Q: So when you were preparing to leave, were 
you thinking a lot about th
e escalating events in 
Germany?  Is this what you and 
your parents talked about a lot?  
Is this also -- was this on your 
mi nd a great deal? 

A: Yes, yes, in my mi  -- we came to the con -- 
conclusion that things we
re really getting worse 
and worse, and that it wasn™t worthwhile to take
 the risk of sticking ar
ound. So -- and since I was 
out of the country anyhow, my parents felt that 
I should stay out, because as I said before, my 
older brother had been in -- in -- in
 Israel since 1935, so it wa -- it 
wasn™t such a big sh -- idea for 
me  to get out, too. 

Q: But your parents and your younger br
other did stay in your home town? 
A: Yes. My father some how just couldn™t ma ke --
 give hims e l f the push to cut off everything. He 
saw more and more chances to get at least some
 of his money out, and he was going to stick it 
out to the -- to the end and ge
t the ma ximu m a m ount, you know, of course that probably was the 
wrong decision to ma ke. My younger brother also 
stayed at home . My parents were rather 
reluctant to let him go because he was not inde
pendent yet, and so he stayed until after 
Kristallnacht . 

Q: So tell me  about what you knew while you were now in London, what you knew about 

events, things going on like Kristallnacht. What 
-- what did you hear, and what did you know 
about what was happening back in Germany?  

A: We ll, it™s a -- you know, this 
became  wu -- practically headline news in the British papers, 
when this Kristallnacht happened, and some  of the 
papers tried to say that
 this was spontaneous, 
you know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new 
[indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
29 
 
 
this is organized. I discussed -- discussed it with
 my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, ﬁNo, 
this was organized by the state, 
there was nothing spontaneous about
 that.ﬂ This was an assertion 
of power, a first sign, and if you 
had no doubts about it, where all th
is was going to -- to -- to 
lead. The fact that so ma ny people had been put 
into prison, some  in concentration camp, and so 
on, so forth, I mean I don™t think that anybody, at 
least I didn™t have any doubts this was the 
beginning of an absolute disaster. So -- 
Q: We re you worried about your famil
y, your parents, and your brother? 
A: No, I don™t think I was worried about my pare
nts because I knew that they could always get 
out when they wanted to get out, and this is wh
at they intended to do. A
nd -- and that they had 
enough me a ns to -- to -- to get out when they wa
nted to do. So from -- personally we didn™t -- I 
didn™t feel this was a -- was to
 -- go -- going to be so critical
. But you know, the [indecipherable] 
the stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in 
our town, people who had come  from Pol a nd, and 
never -- never become  citizens, and you know, th
ey were picked up, and shipped away, and put 
at the border of Poland and -- and -- and German
y. That time we were very much aware of what 
was happening to them. You should -- you know, the 
Poles didn™t want to let them in, and the 
Germans wouldn™t ha ve them. And, you know
, these were families whom we knew. 
[indecipherable] 35 fa milies in a town, of course you know everybody. 

Q: Did you have a feeling once you™re in Londonthat you ma y never return to your home town, 

or what was your sense at that time? 

A: Absolutely. Already when I left Germany I kn
ew I would never -- never return. And I was -- I 
-- I was convinced that this German experiment w
ould last for ages and ages and we would never 
be allowed to return. I never me ntioned that this 
was all going to be over and done with in -- in 
what was it? ™38?  Fa -- ™45?  That™s seven year
s, right?  We  got back to Germany in ™45. It™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
30 
 
 
incredible. It™s incredible, except that it didn™t 
seem so incredible afte
r Munich, you know. After 
Munich we knew that war was comi ng, and -- and that Hitler would go too far. So -- but befo -- 
but when I left, I thought I will
 never see the place again. 
Q: How did that ma ke you feel, had -- di
d you feel an attachme nt to Germany?  
A: Yes, I -- I did, you know. I -- after all, we ha
d traveled a lot in Germany, we had been in 
various children™s camp s, things of that nature
, and I -- I -- I loved the 
beautiful landscapes, the 
beautiful woods and all. [indeci
pherable] very mu ch trave -- traveled along the Rhine. Was a 
beautiful area, by -- into -- by train, and so we we
re very much aware of what the place looked 
like, and definitely had -- defi
nitely had a certain attachme nt 
to it. Felt very bad about never 
being able to see it again. 

Q: So tell me  a little bit a
bout your life in -- in London, and 
are you following the news very 
carefully? Is this some thing 
that you really were, you know, cl
osely following, about these 
developments?  Just tell me  about this phase 
of your life before the 
war actually starts. 
Q: We ll, first off, as I said, when I came  to 
London, I was living with a 
wonderful family, with 
the Jacobs, who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs
, he™d been an officer in a Jewish brigade in 

World Wa r One, and of course, 
knowing a lot about Zionist histor
y, all this ma kes a little sense 
to me . His wife was from a Jewish family that ha
d settled originally in -- in Scotland, she spoke 
quite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [ind
ecipherable] woma n, very hard working. They 
had one daughter, about my age, and also li
ving with them was a nephew who was an orphan, 

and who went to business every day. And also a di
stant relative, a girl from -- a Polish Jewish 
girl apparently from very well-
to-do parents. She spent every af
ternoon in the movies. She was a 
total movie addict, this girl. So -- so it was 
a big household, and actually 
we only ate together on 
-- again, on Friday nights, and Saturday lunch time. The -- the house was located right be -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
31 
 
 
within one or two blocks of the [indeciphera
ble] synagogue, which wa
s a big synagogue, and 
that™s where Mr. Jacobs belonged. And -- and I 
concentrated on learning English, very much 
helped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to
 correct me , telling me  what to do. And ever 
since I love reading newspapers, and the Jac
obs, since they were liberals, you know, with a 
[indecipherable], course the newspaper was a ne
ws chronicle, and I u-used to translate 
newspaper articles and then learn them by heart, a
nd this is how I si -- taught myself English, to 
a large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mr
s. Jacobs, as I was there. Was a wonderful time 
I had ther e. Was a little bit expensive, and so I c
ouldn™t stay there any lengt
h of time , but while it 
lasted it was -- was very nice.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 

Manfred Gans. This is tape number two, side B. 
A: Well, one incident that actually I think is wo
rthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to 
the library, and he said, ﬁDo you want anything 
from the library? ﬂ  And I said ﬁYes, get me  
ﬁMein Kampf,ﬂ Hitler™s ﬁMein Kampfﬂ in German.ﬂ
 Of course, while I wa s in Germany, I would 
never do them the honor of reading th
is, but I felt I had to read it, a
nd I™m very, very grateful that 
I did read it at the time when I 
-- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was 
going to happen, from reading that book. And this 
-- all this -- the prop
aganda me thods, the way 
to achieve their aim. This business of expandi
ng Germany into the eastern [indecipherable] and 
sh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- 
and all this was all --  the all -- all set out there, 
you know?  It -- i-it was shus -- it was oka -- I don
™t know why I did it, but I did read ﬁMein 
Ka mpfﬂ in German while I was there. Then occa
sionally we went to the 
movies, Mr. Jacobs took 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
32 
 
 
me  to the movies, which was, of course, in 
English. And that -- that was a good experience too. 
And generally ha-have a wonderful time. Eventua
lly, when my parents say cha -- that I should 
stay, I realized I couldn™t
 stay with the Jacobs because it wa
s far too expensive, and I had to go 
and look for cheaper accommodation. An -- but -- but
 of course, by that time  my Engl ish had 
improved a lot, too. I had ma de up my mi nd to go 
to the tutorial colleg
e in Euston -- it -- is it 
Euston?  It is near -- I know it™
s near Bushhaus in -- it™s -- it™s
 Euston, which is spelled E-u-s-t-o-
n. And so I ma de the arrangeme nts to find a new ho
me , or new digs with se -- with those factors 
in mi nd of having to go to -- to th
e tutorial college every day, a-a
nd obviously I still wa nted to be 
near a synagogue and all that, and I had to live 
kosher. So that™s -- dete
rmined where I settled. 
Q: What were the signs of -- of th
e war now -- now encroaching, comi ng? 
A: We ll, the signs were the dema nds which Ge
rmany ma de on Czechoslovakia. There was the 
gathering of the party -- I can™t reme mber a
ny more where it was, where they -- where they 
celebrated the presence of the S-Sudeten German 
people, and their dema nds for incorporating the 
Sudeten area into Germany became very, very 
loud and forceful, and it wa s quite obvious what 
they wanted to do. They wanted to annex the Su
detenland. And this led to the Munich gathering, 
which -- in which France and Germa ny agreed -- 
France and England agreed that Hitler could go 
into -- could annex the Sudetenland without Fr
ance and England going to war. We ll, of course, 
Hitler signs a piece of paper saying 
that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our 
time. That™s the famous peace in our time. And 
Chamberlain came home to England, he says 
peace in our time, the memo in his hand, and I reme mber next Saturday, ne xt Shabbat in 
synagogue -- I still went to the [indecipherable]
 synagogue, Mr. Jacob saying, ﬁI don™t like this 
whole thing.ﬂ And of course, there was the famous
 speech by Churchill in Parliame nt, where he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
33 
 
 
told Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to
 choose between dishonor and war, you chose 
dishonor, that™s why you™re
 going to have war.  
Q: Wa s this -- was this a difficult time for you to -- 
A: No, no, it™s a -- you know, it no -- it became  -- it -- it
 just said it was all inevitable. This is all -
- what™s going to happen and so there was nothing 
we could do about it, and we just had to fit 
ourselves into this --  into this --  into this situ
ation. Before the Munich 
agreement, a lot of people 
had left London, including my la
ndlady and her daughters, [indeci
pherable] and I was sort of 
asked to look after myself, which I didn™t mi nd at 
all. And they -- they re
turned after the Munich 
agreement had been signed, and it was pretty su
re that a war would not
 break out immediately. 
People we -- were divided. They ca -- people 
who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I 
mean, you know, this conservative party of E
ngland. There were a lot 
of those in a rich 
community like Goldaskreen, and they took the at
titude Chamberlain di
d the right thing. We  
have not got the means to go to war at the mo
me nt. He s -- fo-fought for time. The pe ople who 
were liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dis
honor which we shouldn™t have gone in for. And the 
people who were lesstich labor, they -- they ha
d been such you Jews, they had been such 
pacifists, that they -- they -- th
ey wouldn™t hear about -- about a
ny requirements such as having a 
draft and mo bilizing, and any of those things. 
They -- they couldn™t ge
t used to this idea 
[indecipherable]. And, as I said, I was very much
 influenced by the views of people like Mr. 
Jacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this
 was a --a dishonor. So 
we™ve faced reality, as 
best as we could. And -- and of course the pr
essure on -- on the German J e ws which -- other 
Jews became larger, until more and more refugees comi ng into England, and a lot of -- and the 

difficulty of getting jobs for people, and getti
ng a way of findi ng money to live on became  larger 
and larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
34 
 
 
organized, largely by volunteers. They had mone yavailable, and they -- I think they, in my 
opinion they took care of this refugee program in 
an excellent -- in a wond
erful way, in spite of 
the fact of course, obviously everybody finished up 
living at a standard of living which was far, 
far below the sort of standard of living 
they had experienced in -- in Germany. 
Q: Wa s life difficult for you as a refugee in Lon
don, or did they also ma ke it easier for you? 
A: We ll, you know, the point was that I had enough 
money to live on. All I had to look after was 
t -- to do, was to work and work and work and 
try and get this high sc
hool sime tric in four 
months, which I didn™t succeed to do eventually, 
but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable] 
was the only thing I -- I was going for. It™s -- I -- I 
did not have to share in a lot of the hardships 
which other people were exposed to, because afte
r all, my father could send me  some  money -- 
carefully, you know, didn™t squander it in any way, 
lived very simple. But it gave me  certain 
pride to -- to live in a fr ugal 
way. And as I said, my aim was to
 -- was concentrated on qualifying 
for the high school certificate.  
Q: So tell me  about the start of the war. 
A: All right. After I finish the 
tutorial college, and have not passe
d the examination, I -- I passed 
everything except the English, I just wasn™t good
 enough. But I -- I decided I was not going to go 
back to school full time . And I registered as 
the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German 
Jewish aid committee, and saw what went on ther
e for a whole day. And in the evening, one of 
the ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- fa m
ily -- you know, these were all volunteers, people 
who did this. She had -- obviously has a tough 
day, and she says, ﬁWould you like to go to 
Manchester?ﬂ I said, yes, I™ll go. I 
thought it was very important th
at we -- we refugees would 
not all congregate in London, and so 
-- so I -- together with a few ot
her people, a few days later, 
I went to Manchester, and again, there was a orga
nized German Jewish aid 
committee, fi rst liv --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
35 
 
 
first lived in a -- in -- what do 
you call -- would you call it, I d
on™t know. Some  sort of communal 
house, which again it was, you know, had to be kos
her, and -- and it was 
very nicely organized, 
and all that, and of course we had to work a
nd keep it clean and all that. And the c-committee 
went out and to tr-try to find us jobs. And -- a
nd through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which 
-- which I liked very mu ch. In fact, this was 
the fi rst non-Jewish offer which the committee had 
had for jobs. And I wanted to go into machinery repa
ir, and it turns out that  th
is, we -- this part of 
this -- this plant was not -- th
e repair shop was not unionized, so 
I could go -- go -- go into that, 
and fit myse lf into that. And it tu
rned out to be an extremely good 
experience. It™s an interesting 
story, you can tell it in great 
details. Again, I had to ma ke it 
clear that I wouldn™t work on 
Saturday, I wouldn™t work on Friday afternoons, 
or would go home  early on Friday afternoons. 
But they -- they didn™t mind at all, they sai
d, ﬁLook, if you don™t work,you don™t get paid. If you 
clock in and you clock out, and that™s it.ﬂ Initia
lly the German Jewish aid committee subsidized 
my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I 
had started working in this job, they told me  in 
the home where we were, that I should go to a ce
rtain place, to a certai
n address where I would 
be able to make arrangeme nts to
 finding a place -- permanent place 
to live, a lodging to -- to live. 
I went to this place, I had hardly
 changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, 
and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautifu
l estate, very rich, obvious
ly very rich people. I 
didn™t know what it was all about, 
but I was hope [indecipherable] the 
right address. It turned out 
that my friend Mr. Jacobs had ma de  arrangements
 for this very well-to-do fa mily to go and be 
introduced to me . These were the Steinats. 
They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous 
Laskeys were the richest family in Manchester, 
Jewish fa mily in Manchester. And the Steinats 
were the se cond richest families. And they were --
 s-started my relationship with that -- that 
fa mily. The brother of Mrs. Steina
ts had also been an officer in 
the Jewish brigade in World War 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
36 
 
 
One, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. J
acobs and the Steinats. So you see it™s just all -- 
all a question of connection with -- and it wa
s very important in England, everything is c-
connection. It™s not what you know
, it™s whom you know. And the Steinats ma de arrangeme nts 
for me  to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a r
oom from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr. 
Steinats father. Mr. Steinats ha
ted her like the guts. He didn™t lik
e her at all. But it came in handy 
for me  to -- to live there, and I lived there w
ith another German Jewish ma n, who was two years 
older than I, and -- and there wa
s a very old ma n also living ther
e as a lodger. Now, this lady 
rented rooms, and she provided meals. It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn™t 
[indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I ha
d accepted, w-w-was techni cally very good, but it 
again, the circumstances of -- of clea
nliness, and toilet facilities we
re just d-disgusting. But I th -
- I thought this is part of living 
like this, and I was living on the 
-- during the week I was living in 
the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and 
on weekends I was going to the Steinats for 
practically all my meals, and 
living in a very, very high cl
ass atmosphere. Undoubtedly the 
Steinats were richer even than my fa ther 
was. And I -- I thought 
it was greater -- a great 
experience. So I -- I think I have to
 take another trip to the toilet. 
Q: Sure. [tape break] So where were you when the war began? 

A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item th
at was also very signif
icant in my  life. It -- 
first of all, as you ma y r e me mber or ma y know,
 I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler ma rched 

and took over the rest of Czechoslova kia. Of
 course, everybody thought the war was going to 
break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure 
it wouldn™t. Because now 
the attitude of France 
and England changed, and they started sending their 
foreign mi nisters to Moscow to try and get a 

gr-great alliance with the Russians going. And of
 course that was their big hope, that they 
eventually would pull that off, and pull it off t
ogether. And -- and all the 
workers in --  in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
37 
 
 
factory where I worked sa id we™ll 
be in war -- at war in a week 
or so, and I say, no you won™t be. 
They going to try this, and they™re going to be -- do 
their best effort to -- to
 pull a -- make alli -- a 
major alliance with the Russians. And this is
 very much what happened. So nothing much 
happened politically, ever
y -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a 
war. But the -- these two elephants were not in
 -- on the way yet. Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was 
at the St einats again, and so I me ntions that I 
had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi fr om 
Manchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me , but
 to other people, a well known rabbi from 

Berlin. Quite young, he was in mi ddle 30™s, or -- 
at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] 

after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats ha
d invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together 
with a few other very prominent people of th
e Jewish community. The day was glorious, the 
weather was glorious, the food wa
s incredible. Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, 
and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who 
later on became the head 
of the -- head of the 
Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis
 University. And he -- we became  friends right 
there and then, and he is being 
-- he being -- he was my me ntor, 
from whom I learned an awful 
lot, until the time he died in, I 
don™t know, some  times in the 80™s. He was professor at Harvard, 
same  ti me  professor at Jerusale
m University. And but that™s --
 basically he was a fantastic 
thinker, with tremendous ideas, 
and I attended a lot 
of lectures which he gave, mostly in 
Manchester, and then later on here, in this countr
y. And he set me  on a path of -- of studies, and 
views that have sur -- very much infl uenced 
my life and gave me  a mu
ch deeper understanding 
of Judaism t han I could have possibly gotten 
in any other way. So that was some time  on May, 
1930 -- ™39. And then, actually on -- so then, 
in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly 
transpired that Germany had ma de
 a pact with the Soviet Union, 
or the Soviet Union had ma de a 
pact with Germany that they were going to 
divide up Poland between the two of the m. I don™t

know whether we were a hundred percent aware of it,
 that they were going 
to divide up Poland at 
that time, but you know, that™s what it amounted 
-- amounted to. And now the road was clear for 
Hitler to ma rch into Poland, and -- which he didon September first, 1939. England declared war 
on the following Sunday, this was -- September fi
rst was a Fr iday, and England declared war on 

a -- on a Sunday night. And I happened to be at the St
einats at  that  time, listen --  listened to the 
speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, whic
h he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I 
had the -- the exact text of this
. I™ve asked people to look it up, I 
think I want to look it up, it™s 
very worthwhile. He said these [indecipherable]evil things we ™ll be fighting against, bad faith, 

some thing some thing, and oppression, but I can™t
 reme mber exactly any more. And against 
these, I™ m sure the right will prevail. So -- 

Q: Is it [i naudible] 

A: That™s this here. So the -- the fi rst thing --  th
e fi rst thing we experienced at the time, was that 
we all had to register, we  German Jews, and we 
were, in a typical British fashion, put before a 
tribunal, which [indecipherable] each case indi vidua
lly, and pe ople were classified into a categ -- 

German -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British
 we were all German. 
There were -- category 
A went straight into interment camp, categor y 
B could go on living under 
certain circumstances, 
and category C were totally free, and being treat
ed like British people. Of course with my 
connections to the Steinats and a
ll that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So 
i-it didn™t affect me  in the beginning, at all.
 The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. Conscription 
was enacted, people were called to the services
, and obviously the country was getting on a war 

fut -- footing slowly. This was the pe riod which we call the phony war because nothi ng 

happened. There was a British expeditionary force se
nt into France but not into Belgium. And th-

they were very -- an-and the western front was ex
tremely inactive, nothing happened there at all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

Hitler was occupied in the east, 
conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were 
very quiet, but everybody realized 
this was a quiet before -- before the storm. I continued to 
work in the same  place I was, and in January 
ni -- 1940, I ma naged to pass the high school 
certificate, which I had continued 
preparing -- prepared in pravin
 -- largely in private class, 
private pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going 
to any classes at all. I 
had a pr -- civil pri -- 
different private teachers. I -- I had a very h
eavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run 
around all over the place, at all time s  of the 
days and nights. And some how this way I -- I 
ma naged to -- to -- to survive. In -- now, you 
know, jobs became  freely 
available. There was a 
shortage of workers everywhere
, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do some thing 
closer to what I -- my long term aim was, and I 
got myself a job in a factory that ma nufactured 
agricultural machinery. They -- actu
al -- in actual fact, 
the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was 
not very good, and the agricultural machinery was 
very crude compared with what I had been 
doing up to that time , and I didn™t think I was lear
ning too much from getting -- being exposed to 
this machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or 
less ma de up my mi nd to give all this up, and go 
into a di fferent direction, for to -- to go into mach
ine tool s, which were th 
-- at the height of -- of 
what has -- one has to know as a me chanical engi
neer. But then of course
, came the invasion of -
- first of Norway and Denmark, and after that th
e invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the 
western front, and now everything changed. Obviously
 with the -- the use of secret sympathizers, 
Nazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in Holla
nd and in Belgium, in --
 in less -- to a lesser 
extent in Denmark, but to a larger extent in
 Norway, now the British public became a -- very, 
very concerned about people like 
ourselves. The fi rst affected --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Manfred Gans. This is tape number three, side A.  

A: So, after the invasion of the lowlands, and Hi
tler™s vict ory in the west , and after the British 
expeditionary force had been brought back to 
England via Dunkirk in the fa mous Dunkirk 
retreat, it -- our life was made a 
lot harder. As I said, I had to
 given -- I had to give up my 
bicycle. Luckily it was summer, so I could do 
everything by bus, and the days were long. But 

very soon thereafter, we were interned -- put into
 an internme nt camp. The 
first internme nt ca mp 
I was in was near Manc he ster. It 
was an old disused factory, terribl
y filthy. It was in Bury, B-u-r-
y, and there were about -- there must have some
thing like two or 3,000 people in it. They ranged 
from Ger ma n merchant sailors, so ver -- real 
Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high 
seas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Or
thodox Jews. There was a whole big group of 
Orthodox people there, and we all stuck together.We of course didn™t pa
rticipate in the -- the 
general food, we -- we did our own cooking, and 
looked after ourselves, which me ant no me at, 
and of course there were no such things as e
ggs, so f-food wa s pretty
 short. I don™t -- can™t 
reme mber how long we were in this disused factor
y. We  were lucky that th
e weather was perfect, 
for England, and this was a beautiful summer, because
 I -- I -- thinki ng i -- 
in case of rain, I don™t 
think the roof would -- would have held up. 
Q: How did you first learn that you we re going 
to be sent to this internme nt place? 
A: We ll, the police came  around, you know, the 
police came around and said oh sorry, you ha -- 
you have to pack up and you have to go -- you™ll be
 interned. The -- first they had come around 
before, and you know, told me  to se-sell the bicycl
e, which I did, I sold 
it to a neighbor who -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
41 
 
 
who was a bicycle nut. He l-loved bicycles, and 
then they came  around later on again, and said 
sorry, we have to intern you. So this was fr
om one day to the othe
r, pack up, and I -- 
Q: And whe n was this, when did this begin? 
A: This mus t  have been some thing like June, Ju
ly, 19 -- 1940. Sis -- so we were in this place in 
Bury, this -- this used factory, 
tried to ma ke ourselves useful by
 working, it™s one thing or the 
other. That was a lot of time to spend, but a 
lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis -
- there were interesting di scussi
ons. As I said, I -- I think ther
e must have been some thing like 
2,000 people in that camp. From there we were 
eventually shipped to a place near Shrewsbury, 
which was an internme nt camp which was all tents,
 so we lived in tents. Again, the Orthodox j -- 
Jews kept together and had a very organized 
life. There were enough rabbis amongst that group 
to organize all this. And we kept
 to our -- ourselves, and everybody 
tr-tried to he -- help, and 
make -- make a go of it. [indecipherable] I -- I 
did feel -- I became quite
 weak because  of the 
lack of food. The one ma in instance I reme mber is 
that when the son-in-law of the fa mous chief 
rabbi of England, Dr. Hertz, whose -- you know
, who has written that book [indecipherable] 

Torah -- underneath the green you™
ll find the -- that™s the Hertz 
Bible. And he came around and 
he -- he sort of assured us that they would see to it that the -- the f
ood situation would improve. 
But, of course, it couldn™t be for a very long ti
me  in this tent camp, and I think some  time in -- 

probably in September or so, ma ybe it was later,
 I can™t reme mber exactly any more, every -- 
these -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of
 Mann, where they had fenced off whole  districts 
of the town and some  [indecipherable] were conv
erted into --  into internment camps. Again, 
there were houses with -- for Orthodox Jews, a
nd we all kept to ourselves. But life was quite 
organized there. It was -- it was before Rosh Hashanah, because I reme mber, you know, the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
42 
 
 
the houses were right on the seaside. For Rosh Ha
shanah, a lot of people went into the ocean for 
like a -- you know, doing the clean
ing, for a mi kvah. So -- 
Q: This is all 1940 still? 
A: 1940, yeah. 

Q: Who -- was it only Germans there, a
nd were there any wome n, or only me n? 
A: There -- there was a wome
n™s camp some where. I don™t --
 don™t know -- can™t reme mber 
where it was any more, but there were only me n, youknow, in case -- there were only me n in the 

internment camp. The -- yeah, the 
-- as I said, the life was very 
-- start getting very organized, 
there were a lot of classes. You could learn 
anything you wanted, people 
taught just about any 
subject you could think about. And 
of course there were a lot of
 aus -- Austrians there. There 
were very good lectures on psyc
hology, and very intensive cla
sses on -- on -- also Jewi sh 
subjects. Mathematics classes. I remember I star
ted learning mechanical drawing there, and there 
were people who were teaching auto
mobile design and things of that nature [indecipherable] was 
very -- intellectually 
very, very active. 
Q: These are just classes 
taught by the other people w
ho were being kept there? 
A: Yeah, yeah, that™s right. All self organize
d. Well, I don™t know when it was, I think it was 
October, November, they had the -- there was an announceme nt that the age of entry into the 

army for enemy aliens, whi-which we were, had 
been lowered from 20 y
ears to 18, I think. So, I 
had actually tried to volunteer for 
the army before  that, but because 
I -- I still saw that  eventually 
we wouldn™t be able to avoid it, but I was 
too young. Then they lowered the age, and a few 
British Jewish officers came  around, and organized 
meetings. Had a big meeting in -- in the 

internme nt camp and told us to come  and voluntee
r for the army. Well, I -- I volunteer ed. It was 
some what resented by some  people. A lot of people sa
id that  they will join if they were  fr ee me n, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
43 
 
 
but they wouldn™t join from internment camp, th
ings of that nature. But I thought that was 
neither one way or the other, and that they ev
entually will have to go one way or the other 
anyhow, so mi ght as well g-go and do it sooner than 
later. I d-definitely wanted to get out of 
internme nt camp. And -- 
Q: Wa s it a -- was it also a -- even though it wa
s intellectually a -- a per -- you know, a period of 
fruitful intellectual activity, was it also just 
very harsh conditions, livi
ng conditions?  What were 
the living conditions like? 

A: No. Living conditions were pretty good, except
 again for this food business [indecipherable] 
the living conditions were quite good. We  -- we 
lived in houses. Of course, every room had -- 
was full of beds, you know, and there was one
 common room, a dining hall where everybody 
collected for anything that™s -- what
 wasn™t sleeping. And -- and it -- 
it -- it was not -- it was not 
a great hardship, no way. 

Q: Did you feel that it was unfair to --
 to keep you in an internme nt camp? 
A: Well, ma ybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- 
I felt a symp athy, with all the things you™d read 
about the -- the Quisling regime s, 
and the traitors that had been 
in Fr-France -- in -- in Holland, 
or Norway and Belgium,  I -- somehow I -- I -- I sy
mpathized with the British, that they had to do 
this in order to ma ke sure -- they couldn™t j-
justify -- before their own people they coul dn™t 
justify having us run around free in their countr
y. So it -- it was more 
-- it was definitely done 
more for mo rale and propaganda than for actually
 being afraid that things mi ght -- sas -- there 
mi ght be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. So I -- I was willing to accept this affect, 

that this w-was a necessary move that the governm
ent had to ma ke. And then in -- I think it was 
beginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps, 

but actually what was happening was 
we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train fr om the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
44 
 
 
Isle of Mann, first to Li ve rpool, and then to 
Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you 
know, it™s just -- just south -- in 
the fa r southwest of England. That was the headquarters for the 
Pioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien 
ma n -- Pioneer Corps. The other me mber s of the 
Pioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- 
actually we re very -- had come  i -- were not -- 
not completely trusted because of legal difficulties,
 or were people who had -- were not fit at all. 
So we had these German Austrian companies of the 
Pioneer Corps, that were ma de up of very f -
- relatively ve ry fit German Austrian Jews. 
And -- and the Pioneer Corps st ayed there in 
Ilfracombe in the southwest for a few weeks, for so
me  sort of basic traini
ng, which of course did 
not involve weap -- weapons. We  
were not trusted with weapons. 
And from there we went to 
Yorkshire, my company went to Yorkshire, an
d -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray 
camp, and fr om there we went to a very nice pl
ace in the -- the lake 
district, beautiful place 
where we build a -- a petroleum dump for storin
g gasoline. You know, it was all labor work. In 
Ketray camp, I don™t think we did that much labor 
yet, but then we went to this Sedberg. Now 
Sedberg was in the lake district
, a beautiful town with -- whic
h had a -- one of these what™s 
called public schools, which of course are these 
very, very private schools in England. And i-it 
was pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first 
time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to 
m- mi x with the population, started having a girlfr iend, 
things of that nature. Also, the other thing 
was my father had a cousin in York. And I™d neve
r me t them, but I knew they were there. And so 
one Sunday I hitchhiked to York, and I came to know
 my father™s cousin, who was the owner of 
a very, very successful factory in 
-- i-in -- in England. I™d hear
d about him, but I™d never been 
there, I™d never been in touch 
with these people, but I just happened to go there. And on -- on a 
Sunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at 
home . He had bought up a patent in Italy for a 
plastic which has what we would now call -- basica
lly the structure of nylon. 
But he ma de it -- he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
45 
 
 
ma de it out of the milk that was rejected from 
the chocolate ma -- making process. And he sold 
this -- his idea to Roundtree in York, the famous
 c hocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got 
their waste product, and he ma de this plasti
c which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite, 
because hi s name  was Gans, too. And they had this
 big factor y there, very successful, and his 
home  really -- which was also one of these beauti
ful estates, almost in the center of York, his 
home was sort of the rallying point  for all of us Gans and related families fr om the American and 
British army, who happened to be in England. A
nd this was -- this was a ve ry, very ni ce c-
contact, and a very nice connecti
on. I volunteered for every -- every 
damn thing that could be, to 
get me  out of the Pioneer Corps. England wa
s now alone. You know, the United States was not 

in -- not in the war, and Russia was --  had succes
sfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler. So 
they were not in the war. So the i --  the British had the idea that the only way they could possibl y 

inflict a lot of da ma ge on Germany was to have
 a huge Air Force. So they were looking for 
volunteers for people to go into 
the Air Force. Well, I went to
 the examinati
on, and all -- the 
examination was in Blackpool, which was -- wasabout two or three hours by train ride from 

where -- from where I was. Passed the examinati
on, was accepted in, but of course they -- they 
didn™t understand. When they f -- looked at my na
tionality they refused to let me  in. But I had 
the -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long ti
me  I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had 

passed the part of the acceptance process for 
the Air Force. So that didn™t work out.  
Q: And whe n is this now?  What point? 

A: This is n -- this is now -- now
, wait a mi nute, let me  see. This is 19 -- it™s nine 1940 -- four ni 
-- ™41. It™s 1941. And this -- you know, in -- in 
the meanti me  of course
, th -- round about -- I 
think it was in the spring of 1941, there was this
 meeting between Elizabeth and chur -- Churchill 
on the high seas. America was still not in the 
war, but America had -- wa s giving for free, 50 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
46 
 
 
destroyers to Great Britain on generally suppor
ting -- supporting the British war effort. But th -- 
Roosevelt could of course not go 
and -- and join in the war. There was far too much isolationi sm 
in the United States to allow him to declar e 
war, but he was actually supporting the British in 
their war effort. And then in the summe r of 
1941, I don™t know the exact date any more -- of 
course, fr om one mi nute to the ot her, Hitler moved 
his armi es against Russia. It ™s apparently just 
totally expected by both the British and the Ame r
icans. They had ma de all the provisions just 
what -- what they were going to do when this
 event would happen. I wish I would have copy 
[indecipherable] if you could get it off the street
s that Churchill made that night when -- when 
Germany invaded Russia. It™s -- it™s very applic
able to our present situation in Iraq. He  said 
some thing like I won™t take back anything I ha
ve said against Communi
sm, but I see a people 
now being faced with a totally different ideology. 
I see the ordinary Russian people, and -- be -- 
being faced with an -- a re
presentative of an ideology that is 
totally alien to them, and I™m sure 
they will resist against it. [ind
ecipherable] all this was -- I -- I -- 
I have to fi nd the actual speech. 
I-I-It™s -- it™s very, very significant.  

Q: And this whole time you were 
in the Pioneer Corps, still? 
A: Yes. Now -- I were -- things
 were loosening up. They allow -- 
we were allowed to -- we were 
getting weps -- we were now s
ubject to weapons training, and fe
lt more -- by this time, I think 
we were in Edinburgh. As a ma tter 
of fact, I -- we were working in
 a anti-aircraft
 unit that was 
the fi rst mi xed sex -- sex mi xed anti-aircr aft unit 
in the -- in -- in Great
 Britain. And it was a 
very, very interesting ex
perience, too. Also some very love
ly girls there, no doubt. And later on 
we went to -- to Glasgow, and we worked -- 
we started working build
ing an ammunition dump 
for -- let me  see, can™t reme mber exact date any 
more. I think by this time -- can™t reme mber the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
47 
 
 
date, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, bu
t I have a feeling that 
we were building this 
ammunition dump for the Americans. So that 
mu st have been after 
Pearl Harbor then.  
Q: And whe n did you get this rare op
portunity that then came  your way? 
A: We ll, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered
 for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I 
think. By that time I had made my name in th
e -- in the unit. See, 
you know, th-these -- these 
Pioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push 
themselves forward very much. They were all 
experts at everything, you know. And I -- I, of 
course, I never participated very much in -- in --
 in sports that were open to ma ny people, things 
like that. Well, one day I reme mber we had a -- they 
were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of 
like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 
me ter, you know, this is actually one round 
on -- and that was the ma jor event there. And of 
course there were all 
these guys there who had 
been such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, 
and God knows, all over the pl ace. Well, I did 
the run, and I won it so easily. And now I ha
d ma de my na me , you know. I -- I -- I hadn™t 
realized myself how -- how -- how 
f -- much better I was at sports
 than all these people who were 
so -- boasting continuously about
 their powers, you know?  A-And 
I knew when w-we were near 
Glasgow at the time, and we were billeted on pr
 -- in private home s -- you know, we were not 
eating there, but were -- just sl
ept there. Had a -- had a -- when 
-- I reme mber when I went home, 
I knew this was going to be the change of my life. And so it went. When eventually the call came 

for people to go to some thing very, very special, 
I was one of the first who was s-selected to -- 
but there being -- after this even
t, we started a -- we competed
 in ma ny, ma ny different sports 
events, and I was always very much the center of
 everything of the team that was sent by our 
unit, to all these spor
ts event -- events, and 
I™ve -- I™ve -- I was r
unning on -- on -- on a cloud, 
you know?  So I think it was at 
the end of 1942 that I was --
 went to London, and I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
48 
 
 
interviewed by a ma n who had the uniform of a 
captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot, 
and knew what he wanted, and that
 turned out to be eventually
 the skipper, you know, he™s -- 
he™s all on the pictures there. 
I -- I s-should have gone through th
ese pictures before with you. 
Q: Yeah, well you can show me  at the end. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: We can look at them. 

A: And also then, we were interviewed by some
body from M I-five, who was supposed to ma ke 

sure all on your background, and -- very knowle
dgeable people, very, very knowledgeable. You 
know this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA 
and the FBI. And I was absolutely sure that I 
had been accepted. I had no doubts about it whatso
ever. And then, a few weeks later, or two 
weeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [i
ndecipherable] told me , and ma ybe three or four 
others to go to the Pioneer Corp
s center in -- in Yorkshire. I th
ink it was in Yorkshire, horrible 
place. And there -- from there we were take
n on a train by night, and the next morning we 
arrive d in Abu Dhabi, which was the training pl
-place for [indecipherable]
 commando. And there 
we changed our name s, changed our identities.
 Within two hours, we all -- we had a false 
history, a false name , and that was it. And that
 was the beginning of the -- being in the 
commandoes.  

Q: What was your false name and your 
background, your identity you were given? 

A: My name  was Fred Gray. I spelled it a-y. And 
we were all s-supposed to say that we were 
British by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parent s had been assigned to such and such a 

-- m- my case it was, of course, Holland, since I 
spoke some  Dutch, it was easy to do, had been 
assigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in ot
her countries. And so that™s the reason why we had 
grown up in -- abroad, but we were British by na tionality. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
49 
 
 
Q: What was the ma in qualifying fact
or for being part of this troop? 
A: That you spoke German without an accent. This
 was extremely i mportant. We  didn™t realize it 
at that time , how i mportant this would [indeciphera
ble] be. I only can ta 
-- give you one statistic. 
I must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight. I 
didn™t -- I didn™t -- we didn™t reali
ze it at the time. We were supposed
 to do long distance patrols, 
we were supposed to do interroga
tion on -- on the battlefield, which we did, and which were very 
important. No doubt these were very important
, because you know, we could interroga te the 
prisoners right there and then on 
the battlefield. And we had been 
trained for that. I had been to 
the intelligence school in Ca mbridge, in -- in En
gland. And so -- and that -- that was extremely 
important, no doubt about it. But the ability to wa
lk into a German position and persuade people 
to surrender without fighting, pr
oved more important than anyt
hing else. A- Anything else we 
learned. After all, we learned everything. Mount

mp ing. Anythi -- we™d 
done any -- everything there was to 
be done. But it -- the -- the ability
 to walk into a ger -- walk 
into a German position and talk to them as 
if you were one of them, this was the ma in 

contribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us. 

Q: They would see you, of course, in your uni
form, and you would appear to be, you know, a 
British, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but 
-- but you™re sa ying the fact that you spoke 
without an accent was also more convincing to
 them, somehow, to get them to surrender? 
A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there ha d to be some  so
rt of infiltration and so
me  fights before that, 
which you ma y have read about in the stories in
 which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we 
did this repeatedly, or in France.
 You -- there had to be some  sort
 of infiltration before that, but 
once you were in that position, you -- then we we
re very, very persuasi ve. Don™t threaten them 
with a gun, just tell them quick how ma ny --

End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Manfred Gans. This is tape number three, side B.  

A: Again, they said that was not
 necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned 
out to be our greatest asset. 

Q: Who was  in this troop, the numbers of
 people, and what was their background? 
A: There were 87 people in the troop, and they were
 all, I think this -- 
with the exception of one 
or two, they were all German or Aust rian Jews
, meaning Jews by the t -- 
by Hitler™s definition. A 
lot of them by wh-what we call Halachak defini
tions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a 
Jewish father, and a non-Jewish mo
ther. Quite a number of those,
 quite a number. Of course you 
know a couple like that had to leave Germany ve ry
 early, otherwise life was impossible for them, 
and a lot of them did leave very early. So by what
 we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish 
[indecipherable] ma ybe 75 per
cent of us were Jewish. 
Q: And was this -- do you think this was an import
ant qualification that -- 
that they were looking 
for, that the British actually chose Jews? 

A: No, they didn™t choose Jews, no. Those -- Mo
ntgomery -- I™m sorry, Lord Mountbatten. Lord 
Mountbatten, who was in charge of combat ope
ration, who was -- you know, 
he™s -- is the uncle 
of, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the quee
n, he da -- his -- I thi
nk his parents had gone 
through some sort of experience in World Wa r On
e, and he was in combat -- in charge of 
combined operation, which consisted of the units  of the army, largely commanders, Air Force, 

and Navy. And he came up with the idea that he 
had to have Ge rman speakers some where, and 
that he needed really good German speakers, so
 he -- he sold that 
idea to Churchill, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
51 
 
 
Churchill was very enthused about it, and Chur
chill sa id that the troops should be called X-
troops. But of course that name  had to be 
dropped, it was too suspicious. And then, you know, 
we became a [indecipherable] of
 the inter-allied commando. That™s
 how we were -- were -- how 
we were known. Wa s a commando which had units, 
Belgian units, French units, Polish unit -- 
units, Norwegian unit, and well, that™s about it. 

Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, 
do y -- and I™m wondering 
if -- if it seems like 
it™s been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept
 secret, and -- but has it
 been sort of a well 
kept secret even -- even now? 

A: We ll, it™s just -- not kept secret, but you 
know, we all went our different ways. The -- the 
skipper, the head of the troop got injured in 
France, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was 
taken prisoner, and he wa s -- did 
not return until after the war. 
He wrote a very nice assessment 
of the troop back in 1946 or so. 
And -- you know, we were all, afte
r the war we were all -- we -- 
we didn™t particular think that we had done such 
great things. We  were -- we were involved in 
our own careers, had to ma ke a liv
ing. Potential wives, girlfriends, 
were not interested in what 
we had done during the war. What 
they wanted was to get ma rried
 and make sure that we had 
enough money to -- to have children 
and all that. And particularly th
is was the attitude of -- of 
the parents of all our potential wive
s and girlfriends. So the whole id
ea was not really -- we da -- 
we -- we didn™t care to -- we didn™
t have any reunions until maybe the 40
th
 anniversary of D-
Day, and wh-what was that?  That would have been 
in 1984, right?  Yes. I -- I think that the first 
one was 1984. And of course it™s th
e -- Peter Maas™s book that really 
brought all this out into the 
open, better than anything else. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
52 
 
 
Q: Did you realize at the time how
 unusual this was, that youwere, you know, Jewish, and able 
to train to fight and obviously eventually 
go to an area where, 
you know, Jews were so 
persecuted? 
A: Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it. I was 
very much aware, and so were my friends, that 
this was some thing totally unique.
 My -- my closest friends were
 very, very supportive of all 
this, and they realized what were -- what 
had happened. But it -- but it rema ined a unique 
experience. We -- and, you know, my
 experience of course was very -- almost very different 
from everybody else™s experience. Fi rst of all, I 
refused to go to the officer™s training school. I 
didn™t want to mi ss the war. My -- my  closest 
friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to 
officer training school for four months just before
 D-Day, and of course they mi ssed most of the 
war. I absolute refused to go. I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army 

command that people were not to be promoted to 
officers in their field without going to officer™s 
training school. Well, I didn™t car
e two hoots about it, but it so 
happens that of course I was 
attached to a Marine unit. And the Marines didn™t 
have to take any notice 
of all these army uni-
units. I was with the Marine comma ndo, and one da
y they colonel said, ﬁTell me  who you really 
are. I -- I want to ma ke -- I want to put you in for be-becomi ng an officer.ﬂ 

Q: So speaking of your other identity, what wa
s that like to assume  a different identity? 
A: Oh, it was very handy. You know
, I -- I had no difficulty with 
it. And you have -- in England 
you have the desire to submerge yourself. It™s 
not like American society. You know, if you tell -- 
in those days, it™s very different now, very diffe
rent now, in those days if you told a Br itish 
person -- a British pe rson, I™m going to be natura
lized, and become  British, and they would say, 
ﬁYou?  You™re not British.ﬂ You 
know, tha -- but here, people -- you come  in this country, and 
it™s -- the people ask you when 
are you going to get your natura
lization, or have you gotten it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
53 
 
 
already, you know?  And braka -- hurry up, and so on, 
so forth. Totally different attitude in this 
country. But -- so. you had a desire in England to 
submerge yourself and 
pretend that -- were -- 
to be some thing that you were not. And -- so thatsuited in very, very handily. Of course, I had to 
give up being an Orthodox Jew, in doing that, you know?  But -- 

Q: How difficult was that for you? 

A: We ll, let™s -- it was part of 
-- this was part of the sacrifice 
you ma ke. I want to tell you a story 
which is very, very interesting, I™v
e -- I™ve not told it before. When
 we were in the Isle of Mann 
in the inte -- internme nt camp 
-- as I said, we were Orthodox Je
ws living together, there was a 
ma n there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer
 from Ha mburg. Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg 
was known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orth
odox who had come  out of Hungary to become  a 
-- a rabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Ha mbur g, in Germa
ny. His son was regarded to be far superior to 
the father, as far as brain and knowledge was con
cerned. And one day t -- one day to the other, 
the son decided that a rabbinical 
career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. He knew 
Talmudic law fantastically, and he then went a
nd became -- took his legal papers in Germany. Of 
course he couldn™t practice by th
e time  he™d finished. So, you 
know, he couldn™t be a lawyer, 
Jewish lawyer in Germany any more . But he was with me  in there, in the same  house in which I 

was in -- on the Isle of Mann. And he -- he wa
s a tall ma n, good looking 
ma n, always  -- he did 
not run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was 
running around with [inde
cipherable] golf cap -- 
golf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ul
tra, ultra-Orthodox Jew. Extremely well versed. 

I mean, a lot of the things which I have learne
d, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and 
Jewish law, I™ve learned from hi m. Well, the da
y when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or 
three other people in the house volunteered for th
e British army, it came out
 -- we went into our 
dining room where -- which was the only common 
room there was, and we announced to people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
54 
 
 
there that -- what we had done, 
that we volunteered for the arm
y. There was a fellow there by the 
name  of Josele. We ll, Josele was a devoted Ye
shiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant, 
absolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable]. He 
got very, very upset, and 
he said, ﬁIf y -- you -- 
what you doing is you will ha ve to work on Saturdays, you™ll hardly be able to eat kosher food. 
You will have to starve yourself 
to go. This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just  
goes to show that you put your secular existence 
far above your Jewish consciousness.ﬂ And in 
the corner wa s this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer ra
bbi, and he was sitting behind his books. And he 
came out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he 
said, ﬁBut Josele,ﬂ -- reme mber, this in 1940, 
ﬁit™s -- it™s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fi ght Hitler? ﬂ Josele, he had a totally different --  totally 

different attitude to this 
-- to -- he saw the larger implication, 
in spite of the fact that by that time 
there had no -- not been concentr
ation camps, ma ss extermination a
nd all that sort of thing. You 
know, after all this was all st  -- 
still to come . But it stuc k -- stuc
k -- st uck into my mi nd, and -- 
Q: Did that influence you at the time, too? 
A: Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is 
why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it 
meant, or whatever I had to do, because -- incl
uding giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the 
time ca me  to be at the commandoes. 
Q: Now, while you were in the comma ndo, did you 
still, in your own personal and private way, 

was religion important to you as -- as you 
went through those war time experiences? 
A: It™s a -- in a sort of general way, yes. Bu
t you know, there was too ma ny other things we had 
to concentrate on to -- to even st
ar t thinking about all this. I -- I -- 
to me the Jewish religion is a 
set of ideas which I practice, a
nd it™s -- I -- I™m not that comf ortabl e in praying because the 
prayers to me are -- have a great 
depth, but they are an idiom that 
we cannot relate to. And just as 
you find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they ra
ther sit down and study the Talmud than go and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
55 
 
 
do -- do prayers. And -- and you know, this is -- so
 you had a guidance there, and -- when it was 
absolutely needed, but that wasn™t very often. And 
I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not 
-- not pray. I reme mber that one [indecipherable]
 one -- you ma y have read this story I written 
about Pontlivek, when I suddenly found myself in th
is German artillery fi re, very mu ch exposed, 
and I just -- I -- you know, I s -- I 
sort of said, get me  out of t h
is. Bus -- wa s addressing wa -- I 
was obviously addressing a higher 
authority, like God or so. And 
-- but it -- it required mo ments 
of that nature to ma ke -- to ma
ke me -- to make me even thi
nk about -- about religion. Nor mally 
the concentration had to be all 
on techniques. Going through a mi ne
field, doing this and that and 
the other. Always a technique we had [indeciphe
rable] out. You had to concentrate. There was 
no time to -- to think of anything else. And th
at™s [i ndecipherable] ma de it all possible.  
Q: So tell me  about D-Day. You -- is this
 the first time that 
you -- you entered -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- into actual war time fi ghting? 
A: Yes, it -- yes. We  had -- we had been -- we
 had tried to do certain raids on France before D-
Day, by parachute, and certain mi ssions were plante
d, or didn™t come  off, some  of them, bec -- 
because we always -- when you were -- when a -- 
when a force like that went out by parachut e, 
they had to go out with the ma ssive bombers that 
attacked the American and British bombers that 
attacked [indecipherable] Ger many at the time.
 So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you 
drop out and do certain things. We ll, none of thes
e things came off, partially because of bad 
weather, partially because the in
formation was obtained from different me ans and so on, so forth. 
So, though we had been prepared fo
r certain raids, and some  of us
 had been on certain raids, I 

personally had not been in any actual fight unt
ilD-Day. We  were seque
stered -- oh, let me  go 
back a little bit. The -- our troop, the German
 spe a king inter-allied comma ndo troop was split up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
56 
 
 
just before D-Day, when there were four or fi
ve of us attached to every invading commando 
troop. I was assigned together with a fellow by 
the name  of M orris La
timer, whose -- and the 
Sergeant Major of the troop, O™Neill, and a fe
llow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. These 
are all these cover names of 
course. Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi  from the 
Sudetenland before he joined that troop. So 
we were assigned to 41 
[indecipherable] Marine 
commando. And we were held in camps for I thi
nk two or three weeks while we were being 
briefed about the landing. And w -- we coul
dn™t communicate with anybody outside because 
those -- they were -- didn™t tell us where we 
would land. We  knew -- we had -- we saw ma ps, for 
which people who really knew France well could 
have guessed where this was. But I™m -- we 
personally, we didn™t know wher
e it was going to be. We  didn™t know we were going to land in 
Nor mandy. So we were in these camps for about tw
o or three weeks, and then one evening, total 
darkness, we  were -- we embarked into little
 boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each 
boat had ma ybe some thing like 80 people. And the -- 
all flotilla set out w
ithout light, without any 
intercommu nication, in a pitch dark night. And as
 far as I know there 
were no -- no accidents. 
We sailed past the Isle of Wi ght in total darkne
ss, couldn™t see anything at
 all. And -- and that 
was it. The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable,
 and we -- as we appr oached, as we came 
closer to the coast in the morning, well, it must
 have been about six or seven o™clock in the 
morning by the time  we landed. But before that 
we could start to see the ma ssive bombardme nt 
of the coast, and the shooting back
 of -- of the -- of the Germa n 
guns back to us. And one of us 
always sat on the steps, so that s -- wa y 
you could look out and sort of gave a running 
commentary on what was happening, what he was 
seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the 
German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells
 started falling nearer to us. Lucky tha -- 
luckily we were not hit. And now, before all this
, while we were in the camps, Montgome ry, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
57 
 
 
a -- the British commander had come  around, and he had said, ﬁLook, every time there™s a 
landing, everybody sticks to the beach because they
 want to be  protected by the Navy. Get off 
the beaches. You can -- don™t,ﬂ -- and that struck 
me  as being very, very significant . The really 
tr-trust that the British have in their Na vy, that
 I could see that the so
ldiers wouldn™t get away 
from the beach. And I was absolutely set I was 
not going to let this happen to me . So, when -- 
when the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the --
 the coast -- and of c
ourse as I said, we now 
were under direct fire -- as soon 
as I could, I run down the gangwa
y, and I got -- got down -- was 
on the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 Ge
rman sol diers who had been taken prisoner by 

the engineer™s unit that has prec
eded us, who were supposed to 
blow up the obstacles, the anti-
tank obstacles that were on the beach. And so I 
run over to those Germans, and I say to them, 
ﬁ Where™s the pass through the mi
nefields?ﬂ We ll, you know, at that time  -- a few days later I 
didn™t have any fear of mi nes any 
more, but at that time  I still wa
s very much aware. And lo and 
behold, when I didn™t threaten them, and, you know
, about being -- talking their own language, 
the first thing that occurred to me  is these guys look exactly like us Germa n Jews. Different 

uniform and they could be on our side. And lo a
nd behold they told me . I didn™t threaten them, I 
had the tommy gun down. I just said, in a very 
calm way, ﬁ Where™s the pass through the mi ne 
fields? ﬂ  And they pointed it out to me. And so
 I gathered as ma ny peopl e as I could, and I™d 
gotten through the -- gotten off the beach, a
nd gotten into Lyon sur 
Mer without a single 
casualty. So the -- the -- the -- that -- 
that was, that part of it, that
 was off, and actually we lost 50 
percent of the unit. Out of 450 people we lost 
50 percent on that day. Later on, when we ma de 
the landing in Wa shoe, in -- which wa s much
 mo re heavily defended than the Norma ndy 
beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the 

landing. But by that time we were so experien
ced that nobody could come  equal to us. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
58 
 
 
everybody di d the same  as I did, get off the boat,
 get over the beaches, forget about it and get 
out.  
Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Da y for you? 

A: No, not at all. This wa s the beginning of
 D-Day. Now, they -- we n -- we knew wh ere the 
German strong points were, and we were at th
e other end of the vill
age. Luckily, the pass 
through the mi ne field was at one
 end of Lyon sur Mer, and the 
German s t rong point was in the 
other. I had no doubt where we were. You know, 
we had studied the ma ps sufficiently. I knew 
we were at the other end, we had nothing to be
 afraid of, not until we would get to the strong 
point. Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be
 in their strong points. Why should they be 
out on the road, in the French villages?  The Fr
ench who have murdered them, you know?  So, the 
first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started ma
king our way along the road
 that was le -- going 
towards the German strong point. But, you know, you-- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and 

-- when it -- when it comes to --  when there™ s so 
much artillery fire and mortar fire. It™s -- the 
splinters will carry. So you have to go from one 
door to the other, dive in and dive out. And of 
course the population was on our side. They w
illingly opened the doors for us. So I says you 
know, you couldn™t do this in Germany. We  knew that 
we would never be able to do this type of 

street fighting in Germany, and we didn™t intend 
to do it, and the British high command saw to it 
-- had come  to the same  conclusion. So we were 
diving from one house into the other. In some  
houses actually there were people who had beenquite badly injured, with all the bomba rdme nt 

by one side or the other. In fact
 as -- as we got out, you know, to 
the road first, there were some  
British soldiers who had obviously been killed by
 being out on the street when the -- when a 
shell exploded. You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditi
ons. So we worked our way 
-- a few of us worked our way towards the strong 
point. Whe n we got into this position where we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
59 
 
 
thought we were about in the vi
ew of the strong point, we kn
ew there was an anti-tank gun 
pointing at us down the road, we got off the st
reet, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned 
houses, which was quite obviously th
at we were now very close to
 the strong point. And I went 
upstairs and tried to look out and look into the 
strong point, but some  Ger man sniper must have 
seen me  there, and he fired at me , but thank G
od he mi ssed. So I rushed downstairs again. I think 
I -- so I went  down into the house, and we were
 sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, 
when we heard a loud bang on the house next door
. And ta -- so -- obviously some  mi ssile was 
going from our side into the strong point. So we
 really didn™t know what 
the hell this was. We 
were absolutely sure that apart from our -- ou
r people there could be nobody there. So we went 
there, and we found an Arab, who had the typica
l look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed 
the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. And he
 had a 19 [indecipherable] war 
front loader rifle, which he so
me how had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German 
strong point . So -- because nobody spoke French, ik 
-- yeah, my own Fre nch was very deficient 
in those days, I now speak French much better
 [indecipherable] transf
er two years in the 
meanti me . But we persuaded him that he should jo
in us, which he gladly did. And he was with 
us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- ™45. So, after 
that, the colonel of th
e unit wanted me  to go 
with him and look at all the different positions
 which the di fferent tr
oops of 41 commandos had 
now taken up around the German strong point. And I 
went with him. And he was one of those 
guys who wouldn™t take no notice of
 any German fire. He was r
unning around with a briefcase. 
His name , I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spel
led it with e-y, and not 
a-y like I did. And he -- 
he wouldn™t throw himself down and her -- heard an
 artillery shell come  over, and we heard a 

mortar come , and -- and [indecipherable] but I 
wasn™t going to do this, so I dodged the way I™d 
learned to dodge it, and as a ma tter of fact the 
next day the colonel was severely injured, he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
60 
 
 
out of the war. So, so much for somebody taking 
such incredible risks, were totally unjustified. 
But then we had -- I -- a troop of
 South African armored vehicles came up and came  into the 
village from the beach, and the colonel persuaded th
em to ma ke a straight attack along the main 
road to -- on -- on to the German strong point
. Which was crazy. The way we did this later on, 
we used armored vehicles, and even tanks, onl
y as mobile guns. We  had them -- h-hid them 
some where in the field, and had them shoot a
nd lay down covering fire while we went in. 
Anyhow, this attack totally failed. 
I didn™t participate in it because
 I knew it would -- would be 
practically suicide to do that. But there was 
one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, 
Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what
 they still had, in trying to do this attack, 
because as we knew well from our -- from the ma ps we had been given be fore D-Day, there was 
a German [i ndecipherable] tank pointing right 
down the road. There was no chance that an 
armored car could get by that. So we hadn™t -- 
we hadn™t -- we had not succeeded in taking the 
strong point on that day. By now 
it was getting late. We  were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon 
some where, and I also wa s getting extremely hungr
y, and I -- I found mys e lf of -- a ditch that 

had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I t
ook cover, and start -- star
ted to prepare some  of 
the food which we had, it was -- I hadn™t eaten a
ll day long. I don™t think 
we had eaten during the 
night either. There was cocoa. There was -- I mean, 
there were drinks availa
ble, but I -- I didn™t 
take strong drinks because they 
slow down your reaction too much. 
And jus -- just at that time , 
the -- ther e was a magnifi cent sight of massive nu
mbers of allied glider s, British glider s come -- 
being pulled by airplanes comi ng ove r, to land on 
the other side of Lyon canal, and they were 

sort of -- you know, you could s
ee them being detached, going 
on their own, and comi ng down.

Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Manfred Gans. This is tape number four, side A. 

A: So this shows that things were proceeding 
along the way they were planned. Also, by this 

time a Ger man fighter came over and flew right 
along the beaches. And you know it says in the 
book the longest day?  That™s -- he got away with it
, nobody shot at him, but that wasn™t true, lots 
of people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him. But, you know, it -- one fighter alone 

could not ma ke much of a difference, probably 
sent in to scare people off, but it didn™t -- 
couldn™t -- it wouldn™t work in our case. So this 
wa s the fi rst -- this was D-Day, it was the end of 
D-Day. I slept very well that night
 in my ditch. I needed it. Next
 morning, we continued what we 
were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed
 to conquer German headquarters, move it 

inland. We  were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get 

into Luc sur Mer. We had to -- not succeeded doi
ng in any idle -- any of these things. So, next 
morning the first thing we -- it was decided we™l
l attack the Ge rman headquarters in -- inland. 
Well, that didn™t tu-turn -- it wasn
™t much of a headquarters. This 
happens to be a battalion that 
had just come from the Russian front and they 
were pretty decima ted. And we decided we were 
not going to go with covering fire, 
we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which 
came off be autifully. And s -- I found three Ge
rmans there who were obviously volgama -- the 
Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals 
from -- fr om Russia or Poland, they™re -- very 
hard to understand them. I tried 
to get some  more  information from the m, but they proved t-
totally useless. So then I turned around to take 
part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point 
-- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but
 by the time I arrived there, 
the strong point had given up. 
And th -- so, I was late. They -- I don™t ex
actly know how -- I th
ink it was B troop of 41

commando that was under the leadership of 
-- of very, very good officer, whom I had 
accident ally met already a year ago before that. A
nd he managed to apparently get -- infiltrat e his 
people into the strong point, and get the strong po
int to surrender. So we went on, and the next 
stage was very simple. We got into Luc sur Mer ve
ry easily, and this -- this
 was the far end of the 
British Canadian landing, and now we were at 
the border of the American and British beach 
head. And that was supposed to be our D-Day assi
gnment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day 
assignment. 
Q: Now for the rest of the war, if you could 
give me  a sense just generally, the kind of 
move me nts where you -- where you -- you know, what 
kind of territory you 
covered in general, 
and maybe there ar e a few things that  -- that come 
to mi nd that particul arly illust rate the kinds of 

things you were doing. I™m also interested, especi
ally when you were able to get Germans to 
surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way? 

A: I can say that important information that had 
strategic significance, I 
ca -- don™t think I ever -- 
ever was in that position. My idea was get as 
ma ny of them to surrender as you can -- can get. 
Find some  high ranking officer who will go with 
you and ma ke everybody surrender. This -- this 
has worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, 
and this worked ma -many, ma ny ti me s. Now, I 
must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this 

and did not succeed in -- and -- a
nd -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost 
was in a similar situation, too. We
ll, the -- after we -- we -- after 
this D-Day experience, we had a 
rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations. They had been left 

behind in the allied advance, and they were 
fully ma nned, and they were hev -- very, very 
heavily fort ified, incredibly heavily fortified. An
d it was just decided that
 it was not worthwhile 
to ma ke an attack -- a direct attack on them. 
So we were positioned around them, near -- near 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
63 
 
 
them, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, ma ke believe that they were 
about to be attacked. The -- the tra -- the trouble 
was that the allies were
 building -- had planned 
to build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [i
ndecipherable] abou -- only about ma ybe a mi l e  away 
from these radar stations. And that plan had to
 go ahead, you know, there we
re fields there that 
were suitable for landing aircra
fts on it, and this had to go ahead. And they couldn™t take any 
notice of the fact that these ger -- these undergro
und fortifications were st
ill there. So our task 
was to make them believe that they were just 
about to be attacked. And -- which we -- which we 
successfully ma naged to do for about
 a week or so. There were a lot of adventures that we had, 
where we did things that were totally wrong, th
at you would never have done a month or two 
later when we had much more experience. But lu
ckily most of the time we were -- we got away 
with it. Eventually enough equipme nt was saved 
for us -- spared for us that we could do a 
daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successf
ul. Again, I ma naged to get these guys out, to 
surrender. So you had -- we took 450 people prisone
r on -- on that day, and we ma rched them 
down to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the pris
oner camps of which ther
e were there, but we 
shipped out. That was an interest
ing experience which I™ve written 
up in great detail. If you want 

to read, you can read it. After th
at experience, we went to the 
-- what we mi ght call the eastern 
front of the Nor mandy beach head, which was on -- 
we -- we were in the part that was hev -- 
very heavily fortified, which was still the extens
ion of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall. 
And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war,
 because the -- we were always going along or 
through some hedgerows to get to our -- to find 
the German alliance, so [indecipherabl e], a-and 
th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course 
you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- 
of a experience, but we ma naged 
to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of 
patrols, and usually I ha
d to go out on every damn 
patrol  there was, because  by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would ha rdly ever go out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
64 
 
 
unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La 
-- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the 
radar st ations and he had went back to -- to 
Engl and. The Sergeant Majo
r O™Neill was still with 
me , s went -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on d
eeplus two or three, he said he was shell-
shocked. And O™Neill wa s still there, but he was largely with the offi cers, so I hardly ever saw 

them -- saw him.  

Q: Now let me  ask you, the Germans you encounter
ed along the way, did any of them question 
you and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you™re Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come  up, 

was that ever a problem? 

A: No, no, no. As a ma tter of fact
, that was the un -- unbelievable
 attitude. If some body spoke to 
them in fluent German, they thought that well
, you know, we are -- we
 have -- of such high 
culture, of course other 
people speak our language. 
Q: So they wouldn™t even guess that you were originally German?  

A: No, no, not at all. Not at all. Nobody even drea
mt  of it. It was -- it wa
s unbelievable. And that 
I think is a -- a -- you know, of 
course ga -- cultured pe-people 
speak German, naturally, right?  
And I™m sur e  you speak German, too.
 If you don™t, you™re not cultured.  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah. So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we
 got on the -- on the north
eastern part of the -- 
of the -- of the Normandy beach head. From th
ere we shifted over to some thing absolutely 
terrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern 
corner of the beach head. Again, this was the -- 
the only thing that was lucky about it is there ha
-had been a British guards battalion there before 
us, they had dug some  way with trenches. We  
we re now some thing like, maybe ma xi mum 200 - 
300 yards away from the German lines. And th
e bombardme nt was day and night, mo rtars, 
artillery. Artillery is all right because you know
 it goes off and you can hear it comi ng and you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
65 
 
 
know what to do, throw yourself into a ditch. Bu
t the mortar fires were -- could be very 
surprising, you know. We -- we -- we
 le -- it was o -- it was a lot li
ke being in World War One, it 
was trench warfare practically. Bu
t at night again, we went out on 
patrol, shot up patrols, we got 
shot up on -- on patrol  and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of 

the fact of what was happening on the other fron
ts. The fact that the Americans were breaking 
through and going south, that they were going we st
 into Brittany, and that they were swinging 
around as the British -- had been a terrible ma ss 
l-losses of germ -- of two and a half German 
divisions in one night with that
 -- were poised for counterattack 
on -- on the British advance, th -
- the Germans had not -- thought that they could 
keep this counterattack
 of two and a half 
German divisions secret, but they -- 
but of course it was all seen fr om the air, with the ability that 
the British Air Force had to -- to look at all Ge
rman move ments, and so it came in with a very 
heavy -- before the -- the Germans could even st
art to move, came in with a very, very heavy 
thousand bombers attack. And most 
of these two and a half -- th
e people of the two and a half 
divisions -- SS divisions, they -- th
ey died through lack of ox -- oxyge
n, or lack of -- or ho -- of 
hi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-e
xperienced being out in 
the open, being ready for 
counterattack. That was -- then -- th
at was a -- none of these divisi
ons appeared agai
n for the rest 
of the war. They were SS divisions. 

Q: What was the most frightening 
episode that you 
experienced?   
A: I think that, you know, sus-sustained frighten
ing, was the position we were in in Pontlivek, 
because we were a cross place, the Germans are at
 one side  in a railway 
-- in a railway station 
and we were on the other side, and we  were be 
-- behind walls at [ind
ecipherable] but we knew 
the walls were -- would not sta
nd -- would not stand a anti-tank 
gun shot, and we knew that the 
Germans us ually left -- with their rear guards th
ey usually left an anti-tank gun. And that would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
66 
 
 
have gone right through us. But v-ve
ry soon -- th-this was realized th
at we were in too exposed a 
position, and we were told to get 
-- get out of this posi
tion and just -- because also, the Germans 
had left devices in -- in all 
the bedrooms of the houses, which 
w -- suddenly all the -- all the 
houses around us went on fire, and -- you know, this
 was a sustained, longer experience. But we 
ma naged to get out of this, and get out and thenwe did what we did -- always did, we defeated 
ma  -- we ma de 10 night attacks in 
10 days in that -- that -- during that time. So we were taken 
out of Pontlivek, was decided what
 we™ll do is we -- we™ll go around 
on the night attacks, and we 
sa -- we go past them, a nd don™t 
do a frontal assault anywhere.  

Q: So, were you at some  point starting to imagine 
that the war mi ght be comi ng to an end?  When 
did you start to get a feeling that -- you know, that 
-- that this mi ght actually be close to the end 
of the war?  

A: Not until very, very much later. I --  even 
when I -- the fi rst time I got back into my own 

home town in Borken, which was Easter Saturd
ay, the town had been taken on the Thursday, 
Thursday, that Thursday before Easter. I knew 
about it, and you know, by 
that time I -- I was an 
officer, I could move around as I wanted to. Ev
erybody supported me , and I went into Borken, 
and we -- even at that time we realized that 
things were not over. And you know, actually there 
were quite a number of people 
from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before 
Hannover. You know, this is hundre
d miles away, this is almost
 on the -- on the line with -- 
where the two armi es, the Russian 
and the -- a-and the ar -- western 
forces me t. Even there, there 
was still resistance. It -- it was just unbelievable.
 We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these 
people. And the closer it was ge
tting home  to them, the c-ca -- 
th-the worse it got, and we had 
absolutely no illusi on about it, that -- that there 
wa s still some  heavy fi ghting ahead of us at all 
times. We  had -- we si -- it so happens that 
they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
67 
 
 
Dutch front, it never lit up. We  
-- we never personally were involved. But at any mome nt we 
could have been told get over to 
this and this and this position, 
and that would have been -- and 
there would have been real fana
tical resistance. There was a very good friend of mi ne, a German 
writer, who wrote a -- a book called, ﬁFive Minu
tes Before Midnight,ﬂ wh
ere he describes how 
there™s last mi nute resist ance in this
 area, all the time, and of course 
he says this -- this led to the 
destruction of all these towns in
 -- in our home district, because 
there were always some  fanatics 
who said they could hold out, and you had -- you had 
to -- had to take care of it. Quite apart from 
the fact that we just knew if th
ere was going to be an invasion of Japan, we were going to be in 
it. This unit had been in the inva
sion of Sicily, had been in the i
nva -- invasion of Italy, had -- we 
had been in Nor mandy. We had done the invasion
 of Wa shoe . There -- no way was there going 
to be an invasion of Japan without us. So, the war was not over. 

Q: And you were -- were you able to, you know, 
have enough strength 
throughout?  Was this -- 
you know, did you get used to living with just always
 having a certain amount 
of fea r , or did that 
fear go away after awhile? 

A: No, w-we [indecipherable] par
ticularly after we -- we felt 
very much experienced, battle 
experienced, superior  to the -- to the Germans.
 Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how 
to move better. A lot of their strength had gone
 out by too fanatical resistance. The fear -- the 
fear was not a real condition any more. Ve -- very
, very confident what we could do, particularly 
after the -- during and after the Wa shoe invasion. It
 was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us 
that everything had gone so smoothly against 
incredible fortifications. So -- so -- 
Q: Where were you at the end of the war?
 Where had you gotten 
to at that point? 
A: We  were still in the south of Holland, in -- you know, the -- that part of Holland never 

surrendered. Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don™t know wh
 -- well after -- even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
68 
 
 
after we left. So, you know, I had heard through pe
ople who had been -- go-gotten to Switzerland 
in this exchange of Eichma nn™s, of J e ws against 
trucks, that my parents 
were in Theresienstadt, 
so I was set to go there at the earliest possible mome nt. 
Q: When is the last time you had actually he
ard from them, or corresponded with them? 
A: I would say in 1941. There were still Red 
Cross letters, you know. 1941. A -- long before I 
went into the commandoes. That was the last time 
I [indecipherable] then they went -- they went 
into hiding too, but of course they got betraye
d. That™s one story I™ve never written up and my 
brother is always telling me  to write that up, 
that story, because I confronted that guy, and he 

finally got 10 years prison for -- but he done a 
lot of other things ap
art from betraying my 
parents. He had s-sold all th
e weapons of the Dutch underground to the Co mmunists. When -- he 
wasn™t a Communist, no way, but he was after money. He was state detective. So -- 

Q: So at the end of the war, you -- you didn™t 
know what had happened to
 your parents, but you 
started to hear. How did you hear 
about them?  Who 
-- who told you? 
A: We ll, as I said, there was this exchange of 
Jews against trucks, and some  of these had gotten 
to -- family had gone to Switzerla
nd. They wrote to my uncle in -- in New York, saying that my 
parents were in ter -- Terezin, and he wrote it t -- to my younger
 brother, who was still -- whose 
address he still knew. Of course that nobody kne
w what I was doing, or where I was. I had a 
cover addr ess and all that, and eventually that news
 got to me, that they were in -- probably in 
Terezin. And this is why I decided I want to try 
to get there. So after -- soon as I got permission 
to do that, I took a Jeep and a 
driver, and we drove all across 
Germany into the Sudetenland, 
which had not surrendered yet, still German divi
sions, it was still real German. Then we drove 
into the Russian lines, and Terezin had been li
berated by the Russians just two days before I 
came there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
69 
 
 
Q: When wa s this? 
A: This was -- I think I got to Terezin on May 12
th
, so I think it was -- must be May 12
th
 I got 
there, or May 11
th
, some thing like -- or ma ybe it wa -- so
me where around that time. It was two -- 
two or three days af
ter -- after V-E Day. 
Q: So, first of all tell me a littl
e bit about the journey to get th
ere. Wa s it a -- a difficult journey, 
what -- what was it like, and what did you see along the way? 

A: The -- the journey was hard for us because we had so mu ch trouble with the Jeep. But you 

know, you could always drive into some British or  
American repair st ation, and they didn™t fuss 
around very much, they gave you new wheels, they gave you new -- new shock absorbers, new 

brakes, whatever you have -- whatever you needed 
could always be obtained pretty rapidly. But 
then, you know, once we left there, w-we ca -- first we came accident ally into the Russian line. I 

hadn™t wanted to do this, so I went
 back into the -- went back to American lines, spent the ni ght 
there. I described it in great de
tail in my report. And then, ne
xt morning we set out and we 
crossed over into unconquered territory, the -- Ge
rmany has [i ndecipherable] to be. That™s the 
northern foothills of the Atz mountains of th
e Sudeten mountains. And it was an interesting 
experience to see Germany as it ha d been, offi
cers strutting around and so on, but of course I 
couldn™t stop. And we went up into the mount
ains and came across two and a half German 
divisions that were still there,f-fully arme d. And they, I™m sure, are the same  divisions as I me nti 

-- as I me ntioned -- as -- as me ntioned in the st
ory of -- Schindler. You reme mber the Schindler 
story?  That when -- when they -- when he wa
s going [indecipherable] to be rushed into the 
American lines from the Russian lines, they --
 he -- he -- he came acro
ss two -- two and a half 
German divisions. I™m s ure that those were th
e same  divisions. Anyhow, we crossed that, went 
down, and finally hit the Russian li
nes, and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
70 
 
 
everybody wants to shake hands, and embrace 
you. You know, the [indecipherable] was a 
ma nifestation of these two armi es, western ar
mies, and the Russian armi es having -- having 
come  together, you know, there mu st have been 
millions of such encounters. But pa rticul arly 
these people whom we met there,
 they had -- they had not been 
through this experience at all, 
and therefore they -- they were just delighted 
to see a western allied vehicle fully armed, with 
people in it. This was their meeting of east a
nd west, you know. Fa -- I forgot [indecipherable] 
they looked as if they had come
 all -- all the way from Stalin
grad, and this was, you know, the 
first German defeat in the f -- major German def
eat in -- in Russia, and we had come all the way 
from the Normandy beaches. 

Q: Was it a very emotional time for you as well? 

A: N-No, I can™t say so. I -- I -- I 
-- I was -- didn™t feel emotional 
in those days, I really didn™t. 
Ther -- they were happy, we were happy, it was a 
great experience. This 
is what we had looked 
forward to, and -- [interruption]. Yeah, the atti
tude, thank God, was -- that I had was different, 
that™s right. – I am -- when -- when -- when I 
got into the camp -- in
to the camp there, you 
know, and again the officer at the entrance of th
e troops who were guarding the exit there, he 
wanted to shake hands, you know, make his contact
 with the western alli
ed army, and then he 
said, ﬁLook, there™s one area in this camp in 
whic h there™s the -- what
 you call the zoif -- 
Q: Typhus? 

A: Typhus, yeah, but he called it zo
isha, of course, in German. And if your parents are in that, 

you have to promise me that 
you™ll come  out and not go -- go
, forget about seeing them. 
Otherwise I can™t let you go b
ack into your own army. So -- 

Q: Wa s this trip dangerous, do you think, to
 go to Theresienstadt at that time?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
71 
 
 
A: Yeah. Now that I think about it, it was just in
credible what risks we 
took. Incredible. Wa s all 
these -- first of all there™s -- there™s the da
nger of the car breaking down, what are you going to 
do?  And the second thing is, the Germans up in the Sudetenland. They were fully arme d. They - -  
you know, they were there to -- to fight. But I --
 like -- just like on -- on th
e -- some of the patrols 
I did, in open daylight. You rely 
on the fact that they™re not goi
ng to shoot at a single vehicle. 
They™re too surprised to see just  
a si ngle vehicle, just
 like they are too su
rprised to see -- see a 
single person comi ng, a pproaching them in 
a friendly way, you know?  So people don™t have 
their finger on the trigger in a posit
ion of that nature. So that -- that was the second danger. Now, 
the Russians I think were very, ve
ry cooperative, but I also -- ther
e were certain situations which 
I carefully avoided, such as ch
 -- taking girls out of
 the -- out of the concentration camp 
[indecipherable] be very inviting 
to do that, but we would have never -- would have never gone 
back with the Russians, you know. This is -- you 
couldn™t do any of those things. So there™s 
question of having enough gasolin
e, you know, there was no gasoline,
 and we -- we -- we were 
just loaded up with gasoline and we had to rely 
on the fact that we woul
d get back into American 
lines before we run out of -- of gas. So -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 

Manfred Gans. This is tape number four, side B.
 So tell me  about your first impressions when 
you arrived to Theresienstadt. 

A: We ll, first bi -- it was -- it was a -- pret
ty shocking experience to see people like this, you 
know, in their -- their starved state. So me  of the m -- quite a number of them
 too weak to even get 
up -- get out of the way for our car. That™s -- it
 was a -- that wa s [indecipherable] impr essions, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
72 
 
 
the next impression I had is this -- these are a
ll ve ry fa miliar faces. These are the Je ws amongst 
who I™ve lived all my life. So n-not that it struck 
me as being so emotional at the time, but this is 
what I realized. And I don™t know who told me , ma
ybe the Russian guards told me  that there™s a 
registry where I could find out whether my parents 
were still there, or wh
ether they -- or where 
they would be. You know, I asked around and found my
 way to this central registry. And there 
was still one girl working -- by now
 it was some thing like five o™cl
ock in the evening I think. We  
had been traveling all day long without a brea
k, without stopping for f
ood anywhere. And I p -- 
asked this girl -- gave her my
 na me  of my parents and she s -- she said, ﬁYou are extremely 
lucky. They™re still here.ﬂ So she said, ﬁI™ll co
me  with you.ﬂ So then went to the house where 
they were. They were supposed to live in, you 
know, again you saw this terrible overcrowding, 
went to -- I left the driver outside of course, 
and went upstairs. It wa
s like people everywhere, 
you know?  There was just -- there was just no 
space for anything. It was like ha ving people 
move around you. So the girl then we nt to my pa
rents, she found them, a nd [indecipherable] and 
she told them, ﬁI have good ne
ws for you, your son is here.ﬂ 
Q: Wa s it overwhelmi ng to you at the time? 
A: No. No feeling. I was shocked to
 see my parents in the state they
 were, particularly my father. 

I wouldn™t have recognized him, I -- a bit of 
a shock, y -- it was not 
-- it was not emotional 
experience at the time. Now it is
, when you think back about it. 
Q: Why was n™t it emotional at the time, do you - -  do you know? 

A: No, I just -- I j -- ma naged to f-fight down a
ll my feelings for things. Shock yes, but deep 
emotional, no. Now -- now y -- now you reme mbe r  th
is and you cry. Most 
of the time I couldn™t 
have done that. There was no -- no wa y. There wa s no -- were not my fee lings.  

Q: Do you think it™s because you had to be so strong and focused on fighting in the wa r? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
73 
 
 
A: Yeah, yes. Yeah, I mean you had to do w
ithout your feelings. I 
mean, you know, it™s -- you 
have to overcome your feelings when you jump out 
of an airplane, you know
?  Particular if -- if 
you jump out of an airplane through the bottom, and 
not through the side door. And things of that 
nature. Y-Y-You had to s -- just have to s -- 
s -- concentrate on tec
hnique and not -- not get 
carried away with any emotion. Yeah, there™s 
a good saying was -- they had in the parachute 
school, the instructors, they told 
us always, if you start feeling sorry
 for yourself, get out of here, 
you won™t jump. Ge -- get out before you have -- 
before you™re going to get your badge, because 
you can still ge -- if you get frightened when you 
-- this was the British army [indecipherable] 
says, ﬁIf you get frightened and want to get ou
t, get out.ﬂ They let you get out, but once you had 
your badge, of course, it was your du-duty to go 
ahead and -- and jump. And th-tha-that™s 
some thing -- some thing worthwhile reme mber, I 
-- I very often quote -- 
quote that, if you start 
feeling sorry for yourself, you won™t jump. Y-
You know, you can™t feel sorry for ourselves. 
We™re in the position where -- where we are, ju
st our own choice. Mayb
e not by own choice, but 
then we can™t help it, and that™s it.  
Q: You say that you were shocked the way that your -- 

A: My father looked like. 

Q: -- father looked, and what di -- 

A: I wouldn™t have recognized him. If I had me
t him on the street I wouldn™t have recognized 
him. 

Q: What -- what was so different? 

A: We ll, I mean, he -- he was, you know, he -- he
 was a well fed ma n before the war, and people 
shrivel up, you know, particularly in
 that situation in which they 
had been. They totally shrivel 
up. And he -- you can hardly recognize. They age. 
I mean that -- you know, after my father had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
74 
 
 
been back in Holland for two or three weeks, 
he looked his former self again, you know?  But 
people changed totally. 
Q: What about your mother? 

A: She some how -- some how she was slightly diffe
rent, she was more -- you see, my father not 

be -- having only one lung and one leg, was probably 
more subject to -- to these hardships. And 
my mother some how ha d ma naged to live through 
it. She worked in the S.S. kitchen, stole -- s-
stole the potatoes. Had no fear of these people,
 and somehow got through in a more positive way.  
Q: So what was it like, your -- your first, you 
know, reunion, what did yo
u talk about?  And -- 
and tell me  about that. 

A: We ll, just about everything 
of course, you know. They had b
een totally cut off from the 
world. They obviously wanted to 
ri -- wanted to know what -- wh
at wa -- what had hap -- what 
was happening to my br others, and they wanted 
-- wanted to know about 
all the other relatives, 
my mother™s sisters, and my -- my fathers re
latives. You know, we™re fami ly oriented fa mily. 
And they had a -- they -- they were amazed that I was an offi cer. Of course they couldn™t 

recognize British ranks. They were amazed that I 
was a paratrooper. They had no idea what wa -- 
all these insignia meant. And were
 absolutely in-incredible. And 
they want -- want -- and to -- 
they told a lot about their experiences, and 
what had happened, and in the camp on the -- then 
they eventually were joined 
by other people who wanted to know what was happening in 

Holland. They were living in what was called th
e Dutch colony of the Terezin camp. You ma y 
have heard about the group of young girls, [ind
ecipherable] young girls, who were in Te rezin. 
My mother was very friendly with them because 
ya -- ha -- eventually was -- was going to be 
Israel. And these -- a lot of th
ese girls came to congratulate my mother, you know, and all that. 
Mainly they wanted to know what had ha
ppened. They had no idea about the Normandy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
75 
 
 
invasion, only vaguely what -- what had happene
d there. They didn™t 
know about the total 
destruction in Germany, they couldn™t believe it. I -- you know, I -- I 
-- I -- I j -- I -- I -- I told my 
father -- he -- he had one [indecipherable] he 
said, ﬁWe can never get r-revenge for this, because 
we can™t be that cruel.ﬂ So I said
 to him, ﬁThe revenge has been, 
it™s finished. It™s not what we 
wanted, but this is ha -- this 
is what happened.ﬂ And I tell him -- 
told him, in -- there is not a 
single -- in Muenster, which was 
the capital of our county, ther
e is not a single house standing 
any more between this boulevar
d and that boulevard. It™s like
 telling you, look there™s not a 
single house standing any more between -- between 72
nd
 Street, and -- and c
ity hall in New York. 
Everything is destroyed. That ga
ve him a concept of -- of how 
incredible the destruction had 
been. When I drove through Muenster, which I ha
d known, through this ma ssive rubble, where -- 
but you know of course the roads had been cleared by American bulldoz ers, because after all, our 
armi es had to get through, all I me t was one wo
ma n who wa s crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on 
a -- on a -- in black -- in a bl
ack dress, with all around was -- 
that was Germany. That was the 
revenge. I don™t remember what th
e -- the divisions, the two and a 
half S.S. divisions that had 
been blasted out of the s -- from the sky, and that
 -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of 
oxygen. And they were supposed to be counter-att
ack. That was revenge. Nuremberg trials, none 
of them -- none of us thought of them. The re
venge had been. It was -- it was the end.  
Q: Did a lot of people at Te
rezin want revenge?  Is that
 some thing they felt -- 
A: I don™t know, I didn™t talk to 
a lot of people. People who -- wh
om I talked to were t -- were 
like the justice of -- The Hague court of justice, 
who gave me a letter to 
Princess Julianna. They -
- they wanted to have some  certain practical th
ings solved, like repatria
tion in -- in a hurry, and 
so on and so forth, which -- which I ma naged to
 have a hand in arranging later on. You know, it 
was -- everybody had his own practical needs, 
nevermind go-going after 
things like revenge. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
76 
 
 
This was a -- a concept that people whom I talked
 to were not concerned with. They wanted to -- 
me to take letters back. I must have taken some
thing like 500 letters back, which the wife of a 
friend of mi ne gave to the Red Cross in London, b
ecause of course I di dn™t have a postage stamp 
to send all these things out. So I put them in -- in 
a big parcel, and I got back
 to my unit in -- in --  
in Holland, and she send them to -- to London, and 
the wife of my friend took them to the Red 
Cross, and they sent them out. And apparen
tly most of them did arrive. [phone ringing] 
Q: So how did other people react
 to you when you came to Terezin? 

A: We ll, as I said, they were c
oncerned with practical 
things like please take 
a letter for me , and -
- or do this and this and this for us. One guy 
came  along, and he said, I own two factories in 
Germany in the Zarund, which is not very far from
 our -- my home , Borken, and I want you to be 
the -- the ma nager of these two plants, because
 if you can come  here and win, it™s everythi ng. 
And I told him, ﬁLook, I ™ m not out of the army yet,
 you know?  It™s a long tim
e pi -- we still have 
a long war ahead of us.ﬂ So people weren™t -- th
e discussions were not --
 not in any of these 
abstract subjects, they were ver
y, very practical. Told them that 
in -- in Holland you had to pay a 

gilder, which is, you know, a lot of money, for 
just one potato, but the starvation was like in 
Holland, it -- it was occupied by the Germans, no
t in [indecipherable]. And th-those were the 
things people were interest
ed in, the practical things. 
Q: What about the fact that you™
d been part of this -- this Br
itish commando, and did that come  

up much, your involvement in 
-- in -- had they known, you know, anything about that? 
A: No. They -- they -- they had 
not known that they -- did not know
 that there was such a thing 
as a Jewish brigade, again. They thought it was of
 -- they -- a lot of them felt it was sort of 
natural. We  were in England, so we -- we -- 
we -- we did the fighting. 
As Peter Maas has once 
said, ﬁWe were the em-embodi me nt of all their dreams.ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
77 
 
 
Q: It seems like ma ybe it was, you know, an inspir
ation for them, a-at the 
end of this experience 
they™d gone through, to -- to s
ee you. Did it feel that way? 
A: Yes. I think so, yes. I th -- I think it was -- so
me of the -- but some of they felt that  they -- all 
right, this -- this is what you ha -- has to do, th
ank God you did it. We  didn™t have the chance to 
do it.  
Q: What did you learn from your pa
rents about what their experiences had been during the war, 
during the time  you weren™t 
in contact with them?   
A: We ll, they roughly told me  what had happene
d to them when they were in hiding, and how 
they had been -- how they were picked up, and th
ey -- they went into this camp in Hol l and, in 
this concentration camp, and they had a chance to 
-- my mother absolutely refused to let hersel f 
be shipped out until she [i ndecipherable] forced to
 ship out. My father wanted to stay with a 
certain group, but my mother thank God, refused, 
because that group we nt straight  to Auschwitz 

to be gassed. And they -- my father had this lett
er, which he was hiding in 
his af -- artificial leg, 
where he were -- his deeds were acknowledged bythe organization of the League of German 

War Wi dows, Orphans and sa -- Injured People fr om
 World War One. He had a letter from the m 
that was written in 1934, thanking him for his fa nt
astic service. [indecipherable] in view of the 
time, you know, she has to give up that job. And se -- 
he -- he ma de the most 
out of this letter, to 
get himself promoted just in these -- these camps .
 The -- the fact that he kept his diary, which I 

have in here by the way, he did -- didn™t tell me  at
 the time, but -- so ther e™s something that was 
interesting, and it came  out later. We
ll, they -- they tried to -- they 
-- they tried to tell me  -- th-the 
worst part for them had been these transports from
 one camp to the other. They had been in this 
Dutch camp, and then they had been in Bergen-Bel
sen, and then after that 
they were shipped to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
78 
 
 
Terezin, and it was this -- thes
e long voyages on these horrible trai
ns, on these cattle trains with 
the S.S. in one of those, and -- and they were re
al -- that was a real horribl e experience for them. 
Q: How long were they at Terezin? 
A: I don™t know, I can™t reme mber.  

Q: So that first night, what -- what else happe
ned the night that you -- yo
u were at the -- at the 
camp? 

A: Well, as -- as -- we -- we talked until about 
three or four o™clock in the morning, and then we 

decided to [indecipherabl e] myself down in some pl
ace or  the other, and decided to catch a little 

bit of sleep before it got daylight again. We  ha
d -- I had gone to the commandant of t he camp -- 

ration commandant, and just to -- 
I don™t know, can™t reme mb er what
 the motive was, but he was 
very, very -- very, very fr iendly, and he -- 
but he also said, ﬁLook, you cannot stay here. By 
tomorrow morning, 10 o™clock, you ha
ve got to be out of here, 
otherwise you™re going to be 
infected, and I can™t let you -- can
™t let you go back to your own ar
my.ﬂ But he was very, very, 
very friendly. Very warm fee
ling. His ti -- the mayor was very
 -- doctor [indecipherable] lady 
doctor who speak -- spoke fluent German, or Russi
an. She did the transla
ting. Thi -- thi -- that 
was it. He [indecipherable] and I reported to 
him. I said, ﬁYeah, I™ve come to look for my 
parents,ﬂ he -- he wou -- turns 
to the lady doctor and said, ﬁH
ere, how -- how do we fi nd his 
parents for him? ﬂ And then she said [i ndecipherable] in the meantime already he was very 

concerned about it. Very, ve
ry friendly atmosphere.  

Q: Did you -- did you go there thin
king that if you found your pa
rents you would try to -- to 
bring them out? 

A: I was absolutely settled not doing that, it 
was far too dangerous. The roads were dangerous. 
People threw hand grenades, fired shot
s, did all sorts of crazy things
. Quite apart fr om that, I felt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
79 
 
 
I had a duty to pick up as ma ny Amer ican and Bri
tish soldiers as I could. In the end when we -- 
in the end when we crossed the American lines, 
the Jeep -- we had 18 people on the Jeep. Si -- 
the ex-prisoner of war, Americans and British, 
who -- who wants to get back and absolutely 
settled on making it. Some  of the m were in very, very bad shape, too. And we ma naged to get 
them across, and get them onto the buses to go 
to the Nuremb erg airport for repatriation to 
England. Returned to England. 

Q: But your parents were not infected with typhus
, right, they were genera
lly healthy at the time? 
A: Yes, yes. They did not have any of the contag
ious diseases, so I had 
been spared that. People 
who had these diseases were in what they call
ed the -- the [indecipherabl e] the -- the castle. 
Listen, I™ve got to 
[indecipherable] now. 
Q: Okay. [tape break] Okay, if you could just tell
 me  about then -- your 
-- after you leave, and -- 
and what you -- what you do to -- to help people 
leave Theresienstadt eventually -- Terezin. 
A: Okay. So, I left, I picked up all these [indeciph
erable] of wars, went back into the American 
lines, and then th-the generals from these two 
and a half German divisions, which I had me t in 
the Sudeten mountains came into the American 
lines, and the American
 com -- local American 
commander asked me to come with him to make 
these people surrender to 
the Russians, because 
they had fought the Russians a
nd therefore had to surrender to
 the Russians, that was the 
agreement we had. That™s -- every German divisi
on surrenders to those whom they -- whom they 
have been fighting. So the Americans could not
 accept their surrender, 
wouldn™t accept their 
surrender. So we returned them to the Russians. No
w, so we eventually got back to my unit, and 
it™s in the south of Holla
nd, and I na -- went to see Princess Ju
lianna, who was in ch -- chas -- 
charge of repatriation, and I gave
 her the letter, which the justic
e of [indecipherable] court had 
given me , and she said she wants to talk to me , but
 I didn™t have a chance 
to do that . That™s it --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
80 
 
 
later on, because by the time  my unit moved on to
 Germany, a nd nobody to this day believes that 
-- believes me, but the first town we moved into
 was my hometown, and 
I had absolutely nothing 
to do with it, nothing. Nobody will believe this. What
 an experience. And there we actually -- we 
were -- we weren™t even the occupation force. 
The idea was for us to be equipped with new 
weapons to get ready for the inva
sion of Japan. So it wa -- it -- 
it was of course was incredible 
experience to be right there in th
at town. We  confiscated the best
 houses in town, to which Jews 
would never have even been invited before Hitler,
 and -- [phone ringing] -- Yeah that -- that  was 
quite -- quite an experience, to be back, out of
 all places, in my home town. We ll, I just don™t 
want to get into all the de tails, but actually [i nde
cipherable] were -- my la
st job in the ar my was 
to be the deputy intelligence officer of
 a 12,000 people camp, 10,000 me n, 2,000 wome n of high 
ranking Nazis, largely preparing for the Nurembe r
g trials. A very intere
sting experience, from 
every point of view, which I ha
ve rarely told anybody about, be
cause even in Germany today, 
people do not like some  of the things that their 
relatives experienced while being in this camp, 
not -- not that in my opinion they didn™t de
serve them, but this is what it was.  
Q: Such as -- such as what? What™s an example?  
A: We ll, you know, people were held in these ca
mps, and -- who were -- who had been say of 
[indecipherable] of my hometown had been a guy
 who -- I only learned ab
out this afterwards, 
actually -- who -- who had been a judge in Po
land. You know, that™s 
an automa tic arrest 
category. Some body goe s to the judge, German 
judge in Poland, can you imagine that?  And, you 
know, you j -- obviously we were -- w-we prepar
ed a case like that, we
 pec -- practically 
condemned the guy to death already.
 He di -- that™s not what they did to him in Nuremberg, but 
they di -- they did get, you know, like the long 
sentences. So some how or the other, I think 
there™s still too ma ny Ge rmans around who, if they
 know it at all about what went on at that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
81 
 
 
time, think that a lot of these things are very unfair. And they still cannot imagine all the crimes 
that were committed in -- by say a guy who was a judge in Poland. 

Q: How did you feel talking to the Germans, in
terrogating them?  What™s 
the name of this place 
where you were, and how did you feel about it? 

A: [indecipherable]. We ll, again, we had a job 
to do. Th-The British ha d a very good system of 
ma king us fi lling in certain questionnaire interro
gating people. I filled in
 all the questionnaire 
with a typewriter, because I type
d on a Germa n typewriter quite we
ll in those days. And I -- I -- I 
had no pity on any of these people. Most of them
 really deserved it. We  had Mr. Arme yer from 
Auschwitz, and you know, he had been a comma ndant
 of the -- of Auschwitz for a while. And I 
don™t think before too long, I t
hought, hey, he was a common crim
inal, who was in prison with 
Hitler. Hitler was in prison in the 20™s. He wa
s in prison for murder. And so, you know, he stuck 
to his Nazi regime , that™s how -- how he 
ma de his career. We  had 500 high ranking German 

officers, who had spent their time in Norway 
during the war, who wouldn™t believe all these 
stories that were being circ
ulated around about concentration camp. So we ma de up a 
[indecipherable] I give them a l
ecture on what happens in Auschw
itz. He describes it in great 
detail, of how people came  in, were -- were -- we
re --  were put into these so-called showers, 
which were of course the gas showers. [indeciph
erable] and we told [indecipherable] who was -- 
thank God was stupid enough to believe that, that
 you know, he had got nothing to fear, because 
after all, he only followed orders. And he desc
ribed all this to these 500 high ranking German 

officers. And these guys were stunned. Th-The
y don™t -- there™s a film, ﬁJudgment at 
Nuremberg,ﬂ where some -- some thing similar is being done. But you know, we did it. Ours was 

not fiction.  

Q: Did you feel a lot of resentme nt? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
82 
 
 
A: To who m? 
Q: To the Germans that you interrogated? 

A: We ll, I don™t know what -- what
 you mean by resentme nt. What 
about y -- I -- I felt that these 
guys had to be brought to justice, 
you know. That we had -- had a to -- a totally different subject. 
We had a major investigation of the attempt on Hitle
r™s life in -- in -- when 
was it, in -- in June 
1944 -- July 1944?  Wa s -- was after the invasion, wasn
™t it?  Was it -- yeah, yeah, it was in July, 
so it must have been in July 1944, do you reme mber that? 

Q: I know you wrote a -- 
End of Tape Four, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
83 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Manfred Gans. This is tape number fi ve, side A.
 So I think we were ju
st finishing up talking 
about when you were interrogating Ge rmans, and 
I was wondering if you had any other feelings 
or encounters with not the -- those 
who had been high S.S. officials, 
but sort of more the ordinary 
Germans, and if there were any kind of different
 feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them 
responsible in the same  way? 

A: I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was 
an -- actually a military [i ndecipherable], I -- of 
course I me t a lot of ordinary Germans, and it 
-- I didn™t have any prejud
ice against them. I was 
willing to judge people on the basi s of who they -- 
what they were, and who they were . It was the 

-- I -- we were go -- gotten quite
 friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of 

fraternization, but ma  -- with s -- with some  of
 the Germans who were obviously had been -- not 
been [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constr
uctive. We  had to work for them. Ce rtainly in 
military government we did. Then, of course, they
 made the rule, very wisely, that no extra -- 
extra Je w, or extra [indecipherable] could be 
in military government. It would be a very good 
idea if the United States had the same rule for Ira
q now. It -- it -- it just 
is -- became -- was a bit 
of a shock that we had to leave military governme
nt, one day to the ot her, but I think it was an 
extremely wise deci sion. They wanted to show the military how -- the British author ities and 

American authorities wanted to 
show -- no, I think it™s only the Br
itish who did this, they wanted 
to show that they had confidence in the pol
itical leaders who were comi ng up wer -- like 
Adenauer and Schumacher, who were now comi ng 
up in Germany, and t hat they would not be 
sidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had le
ft the country and who had not gone through 
the same  experience as these pol
itical leaders had gone through. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

Q: So when were you discharged, and how old were you? 
A: I was discharged in August, in ni -- 1946. At 
that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from 
one day to the other I changed my na me  back, 
I didn™t -- didn™t [indeci
pherable] to Manfred 
Gans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged 
on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I 
started studying for my e ntrance examination fo
r the university, which I -- you  know I had of 

course been back in England once or twice on -- 
on leave, and I tried to ma ke arrangements for 
getting into university. Now I wanted to go for 
chemical engineering because I -- there was a 
governme nt grant for se -- ex-serviceme n, and now 
all these things that 
I had thought were not 
possible before the war, were now possible. The 
results of getting these 
-- what we -- you c-call 
in this country, G.I. grants. 

Q: And by now where™s the rest of your fa mily? 

A: We ll, you know, my parents, of 
course died in the meantime. They -- they -- my -- my parents 
went to -- c-came to Israel in 19 
-- they were here fif -- that must have been [inaudible] I don™t 
know, 1950 some thing. I ca -- and you know they lived 
in Israel until they di
ed. My father died 
wa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died. So
 they lived a -- a very 
full life in Israel. Very 
full, very good life. Course they -- you know, 
th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution 
from Ger ma ny, my father fought like blazes for a
ll those things, and he knew how to do it. So 
they had a pretty good life. 

Q: And your brothers wound up in Israel, too? 

A: My -- ma  -- my older brother, of course, was in Israel all the time. My younger brother went 

to Israel in 1952, I think.
 Yeah, ™51 -- it must have been 1952, yes. Yeah, I think my parents went 
to Israel in 1953 or ™54. 

Q: And whe n did you emigrate to the United States? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
85 
 
 
A: I came here for the first time  in 1948. I got ma
rried, and I went back 
to England, and came to 
United States for good in 1950. 
Q: So I just have a couple overa
ll questions and then we™re done, 
I think. When did you decide to 
write your me moirs about your experiences, and 
how long did that take you, and was that a 
difficult process or -- or not. 

A: We ll it -- you know, par -- part of it I had writ
ten before. I had written it for my nie c e in 
Israel, the one who drew your -- 
your attention to my story. When she was doing -- she was 
going in for a ma ster degree, and she felt that all 
she had to do was to translate my -- my holo -- 
my tere -- Terezin story, that 
will be enough. But the authorities di
dn™t let her get aw
ay with that, 
so she had to pose a large number of questions to
 me , and I answered thos
e. And a lot of it came 
out as such at that time . I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so 

[inaudible], about 2002 some time, I 
started to write, sitting down
 and writing things up on the 
computer. And it™s been -- it™s 
been growing ever since.  
Q: Has it been hard to do, 
to write about these things? 
A: Oh yeah, yes. It™s ver -- ver 
-- th -- the main -- as I said, th
e ma in -- ma in hardship is not 
recounting all the experience, 
but realizing what terrible 
risks we took. We  were so 
inexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in
 the beginning. We learned 
pretty fast, I suppose, 
but we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- 
that we would never have done if we had been 
more experienced. That -- that part of it gave 
me nightmares, re-realiz
ing how -- what -- what 
wrong steps we took. 

Q: Although it seems a mazing to me  that you have such detailed and vivid recall. Have you 

always had that me mory all along of -- of all these incidents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489  
86 
 
 
A: Well, I -- I don™t -- don™t thi
nk so, but I mean, these were ve
ry special expe
riences I have 
written up, and th-the y -- you know, I 
recall them. If I was to recall al
l the experience I™ve had in 
my professional life, I don™t thi
nk it would be quite that experi
ence, but I™ve had a very, very 
adventurous career in my professional life, t
oo, and ma ybe if I sit down -- would -- would have 
sat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured
 up some  of those experience again, it would 
have been -- would -- they would have come  
back. But you know, you start concentrating, and as 
you know, of course, these were very unique experiences. And so the -- Peter Maas™s book has 
been quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it. 

Q: Are there certain sounds or smells th
at take you back to that time  period? 
A: Mm, I don™t know. I -- I -- personally I don™
t have a very good smell -- sense of smell any 
more. No, I don™t -- I don™t think that there -- th
at any of that nature would -- would take me  
back. 

Q: And whe n did you write about your journey to -- 
to find your parents? Th
at was at a different 
time, right?  

A: To find my parents?  When I 
wrote up the story?  The night I came back from the trip. I wrote 
this whole story in one night. 

Q: And why -- why did you feel so
 motivated to do it right away? 
A: Because I wanted to infor m all my friends of 
what I had -- what I had done. I didn™t think that 
was a historical document. Luckily, the guy who 
typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had 
also been in the unit already on D-
Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a 
copy of it. So I wrote it up, and it 
took him about four or five days
 before he finished the typing 
of it all. And I don™t know that I™ve given you one of
 the originals. I -- I ca
n ge -- probably get a 
copy of one of the originals, the 
way it was originally typed up. It™s -- one of them is in Terezin,

my cousin deposited it in Terezin on one of their 
trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did. 
Of course, has mi stakes in it. This one you have
 in there is -- which was done on a computer by 
my secretary is -- is more correct. 
Q: And finally, do you feel that there have been th
ings in your life, decisions, or the way that 
you™ve approached things in your life that come  
directly from, you know, the experiences, what 
you went through during the war, what also, 
in general, the Holocaust, you know, that 
experience? 

A: Yeah, yeah, it™s hard for -- it™s
 hard for non-technical people to 
realize that, but 
the fact of the 
ma tter is that I™ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I™v
e done, if you put a large chemical plant on line, 

with a new process, new, untried equipment, and 
all that sort of thing, 
the -- the experience is 
more telling than almost anything I™d done in the 
war. As I said in one of the comparison, on the 
night of the fifth or sixth of
 June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the 
night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a 
high pressure, or elevated
 pressure chlorination 
plant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. But 

it™s very hard for non-technical peop
le to realize what is involved
 in the invention, development, 
design and start-up -- a commercial ization st art-up of a chemi cal 
process. That -- that™s one -- on 
aspect of it. So there have been 
very -- a lot of very 
interesting experiences.
 The highlight of my 
professional career, I suppose, was my giving a l
ecture in the University
 of Hanoi in 1986, to a 
totally hostile -- hostile audience, 
trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when 
they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they we
re totally hostile, not 
willing to list en. I --  as I said, 
in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lect uring 13 years 
before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphe
re was still very different then. But --

Q: I -- I s -- I think I read some where that you 
-- you™ve also been back to Germany a nd have 
spoken to students there. 
A: Yes, regularly. 

Q: And wha t ™s -- what™s that been like for you? 

A: Regularly. Oh that™s a very interesti
ng experience, very worthwhile. In 1988, on the 
anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50
th
 anniversary of Kristallnacht, 
they invited us back from my 
home town, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came 
back. My two brothers came from Israel with 
their wives. Everybody could bring one compan
ion, my wife came along. And we -- I ma de a 
condition for comi ng back, we ma de that we were 
going to be allowed to 
lecture in the schools. 
And the people were so enthused about what we
 did, that they kept on inviting us again and 
again. I™ve been there almost every second year, 
my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- 
he died in the meanti me , he went there back ever
y year to lecture, and 
it was a very worthwhile 
experience. I insisted on not only lecturing on my
 war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, 
but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts ofJudaism, which went down extremely well. It™s a 
great privilege to do that. 

Q: And students you found were receptive? 

A: Oh very. Extremely receptive. They -- well, of
 course it depended a little bit as to who the 
teacher was. If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very mu ch more 

[indecipherable] than if it was just some body 
who let us cu-cut in. But this was a very 
worthwhile experience. And as I said, they paid fo
r it. They gave us all expenses. I™ve written up 
a lot about these experiences. Unfortunately 
I have not [indeciphera
ble] but when the BBC 
thought of ma king a film about my life,
 they wanted to incorporate this
 into their -- into that film. 
And no -- and just -- and th-they 
-- they, in fact they asked me
, think you can get us some  non --

ex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-h
ow do you call it, non-rege
nerated?  The wa -- y-
you know?  I said I can, ye s I can. I know we -- 
we can produce it. It™s still there. So -- 
Q: Did you enjoy going back to Germany?  Wa s th
ere a part of you that
 enjoyed going back? 
A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first ex
perience. My wife in the -- the first time -- she 
only went along once, she was very apprehensive
 about it, very appreh
ensive. She somewhat 
frightened, but ma ybe she was already comi ng 
down with the sickness at the time. So -- 
Q: And your -- in the house where you grew up, tell
 me  just about the different stages it went 
through during the course of the war. 
A: Well, when my parents left it became Gest
apo headquarters. And they even had a torture 
chamber in our wine cellar. And then it was ta
ken over by the mili -- British military government 
as the headquarters for the district. This was when
 I came back there, only two days after -- after 
the town has been liberated, the advance people were
 just mo -- moving in. It stayed that way for 
awhile, and after that  they sold it, or they -- it
 was handed over to the German police. It became  
police headquarters in the town for a little whil
e, not very long. And th
en it went back into 
private possession. At the mo ment it™s largely -- 
there are four lawyers in it, I think it™s 
[indecipherable] their offices in there. 

Q: Do you reme mber the address? 

A: Yes, of course, Bochholderstrasse 48. 

Q: Is there anything el
se you™d like to add? 
A: Yeah, can talk for a fe w more volumes if you want to. 

Q: I know you have a lot of experiences. 

A: I want to tell you one other 
little story that™s very interes
ting. You know, when I was in -- 
preparing these, we were in the zenol ager, with
 high ranking Nazis who 
had to investigate the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0489

attempt on Hitler™s life,
 inter -- interviewing some  of th
ese generals, you know? And I was 
asking them exactly what they went through in or
der to get into a confer
ence with Hitler. These 
guys were hardly searched at all. It -- unbeli
evable, you know?  I -- so 
I took all this down, and 
didn™t say anything, didn™t say anything [indeciphera
ble]. And I said -- said to one of those guys. 
ﬁYou goddamn idiots. You were not willing to take
 the risks which we on the -- soldiers on the 
field had to take. It would have 
been so easy of you to -- for you to take out a pistol and shoot 
this guy, and pilt -- ge -- get rid of 
him, and get rid of the war, and 
all that sort of thing. And if 
you -- you -- after all, you had free access to hi m.ﬂ 
So the guy said, ﬁBut captain, in vi ew of 
Field Marshall Sbaten, the spine become s rubber.
ﬂ I -- I [indecipherable] 
understand. That™s all -- 
all they want ed to be, get a fi eld 
Marshall, become a field Marshall. 
Q: Well, I want to thank you so much for -- 
for taking so muc h time, and -- and -- and -- 
A: Thank you. I™m surprised I could talk that long.
