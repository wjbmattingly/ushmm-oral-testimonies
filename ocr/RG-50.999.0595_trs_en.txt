So Robert Behr was born in Berlin, Germ any on March 1,1922. He turned 95 this

Germ any with the city of  Berlin circled. W here Bob was born.  Bobwas the only child of 
Alf red andLilly Behr and Bob'sfather served in the Germ an Arm y inW orld W ar I.  Here 

we see a photograph of  Bob's f ather, Alf red Behr, in hisW orldW ar I unif orm .
 
T hisphotograph shows Bob'sm otherandf ather atthe beach in 1921 or 1922. Life 
changeddram atically for Bob Behr and hisfam ily and all Jews in Germ any when the Nazis

cam p.  Later in 1942Bob
 
andhis mother andstepfather were arrested and sent to 
Czechoslovakia.which we see oven thism ap.
 
He was interned in trees, also calledTerezin andthis pointsto trees.  Here we see 
a mapof  trees itself.  Later in1924 Bob was sent to a satellite cam p 
in Wulkow, Germ any 

,where he worked to rebuild the SS general headquarters destroyed by the Allies. Bob 

was liberated by the Soviet Arm y in May, 1945.
 
In 1947, Robert imm igrated tothe United States where heenlisted in the United 
States Arm y, hoping to be assigned to Berlin so he could carefor his m other. He was 

placed in Germ any, and we close with this photoof  Boband hism other in Berlin. T oday

BobBehr: If anybody ever tells you thatoldage is a blessing because you don't 
have to work anym ore, you don't have to do this anym ore, that anym ore, tell them  to go to 

hell because it 
isn 't true .
 
( Laughter ).
 
(Applause).
 
Old age is a pain.  And I'm  grateful that youare com ing to listen to me and I'll turn it 
back over tom y m entor.
 
Jen Ciardelli: W ell,Bob, we thank youf or joining us today.  And Bob, your story, 
you have som any stories to tell us.W e have sucha short period oftim e.  If  it'sokay with 

you, I say we jum p right into it.  AndI wonder,you were born in Berlin in 1922.  Can you 

tell us, start usoff by talking about lif e in Germ any before1933,before the Nazis cam e t
o 
power.

BobBehr:W ell, I was a kid. I just grew up.  I didn'tunderstand thepolitical 
ram if ications of the lost war,W orldW arI I'm  talking about that Germany had lost. But 
personally, it didn't really aff ect us. My f ather, m y parents, were m iddle class. My f ather 

was a doctor,m y m other was a housewif e who never went touniversity.  She just raised 

m e and
 
--
 
but life bef ore the Nazis was diff icult but not impossible. W hat do Im ean by 
that. W hat Im ean by that is sim ply thatGermany, for thef irst tim e,had a Constitution and 

if  you want to know m ore about it, see me later.  ButGermany never hada Constitution 

because theemperorwas running the show andnow they had andwe were
 
--
 
m aybe I 
should say I had no siblings, no mother andfather
 
--
 
no
 
brothers andsisters and the story 
I was told why this happened,that when I was bornm y m other tookthef irst look atm eas 

a baby.  She saidoh,m y God,enough is enough, and let it go at that and shemeant it.  

Shenever had abrother, never had a sister. I was the only child. 
 
I grew up in the1920s.  None of  you was even
 
--
 
your grandfathersare living at that 
tim e. So it was a time where Berlin was recuperatingf rom  a lost war.  It was a very vibrant 

city, ver y li vel y city and I grew up with a normal kids growing up in the big city and nothing 

special. Butthere were things which is it all right for me to mention the Holocaust radio?
 
Jen Ciardelli: W ell, yeah.  Do you want to go when Hitler was appointed Chancellor 
andtalk about how things
 
--
 
Bo b
 
Behr:  T hat com es later.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Okay.
 
BobBehr: I just wanted to tell you m yf irst acquaintance
 
--
 
you got to excuse us, 
we are oldf riends so we don't
 
--
 
we don't hate each other.
 
(Laughter)
 
Even if  we interrupteach other. Butno, the reason 
Im en tio n it is tha t I'm  a  kid.  I 
gre w up.  I know nothing about politics and sof orth.  But you know, there is something in 

your subconscious which begins to nag on you.  Now, letm eexplain what I mean by this.  

I have a Jewish m other, I have a Jewish father, and obviously I was Jewish.  Andthat in 

thebeginning didn't botherm e very m uch. My parents and
 
--
 
itm ight interest you to know, 
they were m ore Germ an than Jewish.  Like I say to other audiences,we were f irst of allm y 

parents were Germ ans and secondly they wer e Germ ans and thirdly they were Germ ans 

andonly then when they Jewish.  So you see thepriority this.  And Igre w up with the idea 

thatGermany was a wonderful country.  Itm ay have lost the war
 
--
 
war but basically it was  
a  
--
 
not only l
andscape
-
wise beautif ul, ithad a culture, it had a entertainment, it was a very 
vibrant city which, of  course, I couldn'tenjoy.  I was m uch too young.  And yet you know, 

Ladies and Gentlem en, when I think back 75years, thenI rem em ber things which are 

t
oday
 
--
 
no,norm ally I ask the audience,butyou guys are sm art.  You know the answer.  
W hat was them eansof mass com municationin the 1920s?  I give you two.  I give you the 

f irst one, which were newspapers. W hat's the secondone?  Ma'am, any idea what 
wa s  

m ass comm unicationsin 1923? Radio.  Of course you all knew that. Radio was what TV 

is for today.  It was a means where people couldbuy a cheap radio, get the news and so 

forth. And me, growing up in Berlin, listening to the radio which m y father h
ad  on  

constantly.  He was ve ry interested inthe
 
--
 
the world around him , including politics,I 
heardthings which despairedm e.  And thosethings were anti
-
Jewis h. T here was am an 
outof  the loudspeakerof my f ather's radio about the Jews having causedthe loss ofWorld 

W ar I . T h e J e ws  m a de
 
--
 
signed theT reatyof  Versailles.  Im ean, it went onand on and 
on. And I went tom y m other and said,"W hat's Dad listening to?"  My m other said, " Don't 

4 
 
you pay any attentionto him.  If yourf ather 
--
" and that's
 
a quote, Ladies and 
Gentlem en 
--
 
" If yourfather isdum b enough to want to listen to some politician who sits 
God knows where between you andI and Munich,and he was m aking anti
-Je wish  
speeches."   Andm y mother in herown wa y tr ied to calm me down she knew I was upset 
and she knew I was Jewish and why is the man constantly harpingagainst the Jews.  She 

said don't worry about it.  And shem ade af am ous sentence which to thisday sits in m y 

m ind, and she said, " You have nothing to worry about."  And she explained in her own 

m otherly wa y that we li ved in a democracy, that Germ any now has a new Constitution and 

that we areprotected by the policeand the best thing I cando isnotto worry.  Don't pay 

any attention what your father gets out of theradio.  You
 
have nothing to worr y about it.  
Now I want todoa jump.
 
W hat ha p pe n s ?
 

Jen Ciardelli: And so now you're talking, soAdolf  Hitler is appointed Chancellor in 
1933, and you're11 years old at thistime.
 
Bob Behr:  Yes.
 
Jen Ciardelli: And life changes.
 
Bo b
 
Behr: I was 11 years old when something so drastic, so enormous happened 
that it took yearsf or the world to understand it. W hat happened is a sim ple 

adm inistratively act.  The Nazi party was the largest party in Germ any.  Our ver y
 
--
 e xcu se  
m e.  Our very old andsenile president had no choice.  He needed to appoint the leader of 

theparty as the Chancellor of  Germ any andhis name was Adolf Hitler.  And I just 

m entioned Chancellorthis is why I like to talkto adults. This is why I'm  gratef ul youare 

co
m ing.  I don't liketo talk toeighth graders. Not that the kids are not smart,but if you say 
Hitler becam ea Chancellor, they haven't got the vaguest notion what a Chancellor is. But 

you do so I don'thave to explain that.  But anywa y, Hitler suddenly at 11:00 on aSaturday, 

he becam ethe Chancellor.  And with this, rem em ber m y m other'sfam ous words, you don't 

have to worry about anything, we are protected by thepolice, all of this went out of  the 

windo w.  It is alm ostdifficultf orm e 70
-
s om e ye a r s  l a
ter todescribeto you Am ericans, 
born and raised in af ree country.  Nota perfect onebutat leastaf ree andhonest country 

and to explain how
 
--
 
with literall y within 24 hours life changed sodrastically.  And with 
Hitler as the Chancellor, he couldnow im plem ent the very thing m y m otherhad told me 

don't you worry about. You have nothing to worry about. So we had something to worr y 

about.  He
 
--
 
Hitler we nt into politics with a onem ajorobjective and this is to destroy the 
Jews.  In thosedays we're
 
talking about 1933, and he didn't talk about killing, buthetalked 
about elim inating them f romthe econom ic, the scientif ic, the arts, wherever Jews were, 

they are to be elim inatedfrom  theGerman life.  And guess what? He did. He did with a 

bang.  I mean, lif e isdiff icultf or me todescribe.  Can
 
--
 
I don't know anything about your 
hometown, nor do I need to know.  But im agine your hom etown suddenly having signs all 

over.  I usually go and ask som ebody what his favorite sport is.  I'm sitting a little
 
farther 
away so I'll skip that.  I ask and the guy says football.  So I saidfootball.  Am ericanfootball 

or Germanfootball known as soccer? Andhe said European, soccer.  And said what do 

you need to play soccer?  W ell,the kid looksatm e and says I needa ball. I say yes, you 

do. W hatelse you need?  I need goals.  Ineed two goals.  One on each endof  thef ield. 

So what's the big problem ?  W ell, the problem  is the Nazis decreed that no Jews could 

play on thisf ield. W e were elim inated.  My favorite sport inthose days when I grew up 

was s wim m ing.  I just loved to swim . T he problem that we have nowater?  No, we had 

5 
 
plenty of  water. W hat we didn't have was a pool where the water goes in because the 
poolhada big sign saying, "No Jews should swim
 
in this pool."  Andso it went. T he city 
went f rom a very sophisticated, modern city into an absolute abyss where everything was 

bad.  Jews were som ething which the Nazis detestedand wanted toelim inate. In the 

1930s when Hitler becam e Chancellor in19
33
 
--
 
don't worr y, you're not going to get atest 
on it,but just rem em ber 1933, that's when Hitler came. And within months he had 

radicalized what we call today, he had radicalized the German people.  I still, being as old 

as I am , cannotunderstand how Germaneducated people, sophisticated people, could 

suddenly f allfor a rabble
-
rouser.  Of course there's an explanation.But guess what, I 
don'thave tim e to give  it to youbecauseI have m ore to tell you. So just takem y word f or 

it.  It wa s a  city
 
--
 
Berlin became a city which
 
--
 
where Jews were not wanted, where Jews 
were disliked, where Jews were chased away.
 
T here were tracesall over with signs on it, Jews not wanted. I can just give you 
oneexam ple. W herewe lived, we li ved in an apartm ent.W e 
didn't have enough m oney 

to buy a house.W e lived in anapartm entonthe thirdf loor.  Noelevator, but we had a 

home. And on the bottom on the street where we li ved there was a little ice cream parlor.  

Just an ordinary and we kids usedto spend our pocketm oney in that ice cream parlor in 

summ ertim eandenjoy their merchandise.  Now they had a big sign suddenly, "We do not 

serve Jews."   I don't know how m any of you
 
--
 
let me see your hands
 
--
 
have already been 
upstairs. 
 
Jen Ciardelli: Probably
 
--
 
oh, 
af ew.  Probably just a few andm orewi ll go up af ter 
they hear you speak.
 
BobBehr: Good. You wil l go upstairs.  Letme, if  Imay, alert you tosomething.  
On thefourthf loor where you wil l arri ve thereis all sorts of dynamic exhibits andam ong 

t h em  i
s a very sm all television screen which has nothing spectacular about it.  Ithasno 
m usic. Ithas nom argins.  It has nof licks.  Itwas just a rolling bandof informationon the 

fourthf loor. And the reason I mention it, because to me, this is oneof  th
e m ost 
devastating exhibits in that wholem useum  here. W hy?W hatdoes it show?  Did it show 

m urder or anything?  No.  It justhad words wr i tten in it. And that little screen, if you take a 

few m inutes to stand there, listed all theanti
-
Jewish la ws that
 
the Nazis passed where we 
lived.  Letm e give you som e exam ples. 1933, Hitler came to power.  1934, the year 

during a big rally if  the city of  Nurem burg theNazis released som e laws which were 

m andatory f or theGerm ans.  Oneof  the laws which they released during thefestival in 

September of 1934 was they took away our citizenship.  Now, thinkabout it. All of  you 

have or areentitled to probably Am ericanpassports. The Americanpassport is derived 

f rom  your birth in Am erica.  You are an Am erican citizen.  And with that you have the 

rights and privileges of an American citizen. W e,m y parents,had the right and privileges 

of  Germ an citizens whi ch includedof  courseall the civil rights. W ith one strokeof a pen in 

September of 1934, only one year af ter
 
Hitlercam e topower, we were not
 
--
 
they took 
away our citi zenship.  Hitler declaredthat noJews, regardless wher e he was born, that no 

Jews could bea citizen.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Bob, and I know that therearethrough this time, rightT Nazis 
increasingly
 
put in these restrictionsthat in 1938 really culm inated ina pogrom  that 
targeted the Jewish peopleparticularly.
 
BobBehr: Yeah.  From  thattim e on, after our citizen was taken awa y, the screws 
were tighter and tighter.  T hat screen I was telling you, you cannot imagine the things the 

6 
 
Nazis prohibited.W eweren't allowed to have apet.  Can you im agine that? We were not 
allowed to have a dog or a cat. W e were notallowed to have anautom obile.  Not allowed 

to have a telephone. Not allowed tohave a 
radio and so forth.  And the
 
--
 
the Nazis were 
bound anddeterm ined and to some degree successf ulas to elim inate the Jewish people 

f rom  the life in Germ any.
 
Letm e give you af igure, which I don'tm ention very of ten.  Germ any in thosedays 
had 65 m illion 
people in the 1930s.  How m any of those were Jews?  500,000. T hat was 

the entire
 
--
 
those 500,000 became to quote Adolf  Hitler, an eternal enem y of  Germ any.  
T hose500,000 peoplewere bound and determ ined to destroy Germany.  So youneed to 

do this trying
 
to understand.  It's difficult.  Iagree with you, it's ver y diff icult tounderstand 
to lead a life where you're an outcastand you areanoutcast simply because not what you 

did but what you are. And there'safundamental difference.  You are born Jewish and 

therefore you are badpeople. Let me justdo one thing.  Most people think that the 

Germ ans were so anti
-
Jewish because of  religion.  That is not true. I don't care who tells 
you that.  Religion was not the reason. W hy?  Because you can change you
r re ligio n .   

You can go to a priestand say Father,I would like to become a Catholic and the Father 

wi ll take you, teach you, andm ake you a Catholic. T he Nazi philosophy, what they hated 

about Jews, was theirblood.  And that was the diff icult thing to change.  You don't change 

your blood. You were born with bad bloodand theref ore you were a bad person. So you 

get an ideathe life you're livin g.  People hateyou, people don't like you,people don't want 

anything to do with you sim ply because you got b
ad blood. 
 
Now, put that in your pipe and sm oke it. Youcan see what it is
 
J e n  Cia rd e lli:  W ell,  in
 
--
 
I think you're gathering here, evenf rom ourshort 
conversation, we could beherefor the restof thepeople I thinkhearing about so many 

different aspects of what you experienced. And there'snotenough tim e. In1938 this 

violence against the Jewish population was expressed throughanevening of  violence that 

targeted shops and businesses.  Can you tell us how that event, Kristallnacht, affected 

your 
f am ily in 1938?
 
BobBehr: You going to give m e another 30m inutes? 
 
(Laughter)
 
Now you're going to do that.  You wantto getgoing. W hat happened is in essence 
there'sa lotm ore behind it,but I'll tell you that privately af terthe show is o ver. W hat 

h
appened on that
 
--
 
atthis time N Novem berof 1938, thata Jewish fellow shot aGerman 
e m ba s s y of f ic ia l,  k ille d h im .  A nd  t he  Na zis  it
 
--
 
there's a long story about it, but we just 
sim ply don'thave the tim e.  Anyway, the Jewi shf ellow when that happened in Paris, 

France, the Jewish f ellow shot the Germ an em bassy off icialand the Nazis used that 

assassinationof  the Germ an off icial who was of  course a Nazi andhe
 
--
 
they used that 
occasion tohave aenorm ous time of destruction. That was a timewhen the sy
nagogues 
were burned.W e lived not far away f rom  onesynagogue and I could see some of it. They 

putf ire, they took the holy Scripture of  the Jews, throw them  on thef loor,made the 

Germ ans walk across. They told thef irem ennot to extinguish thef ires in the synagogues. 

Let them  burn. Justbe sure thatthe Christian buildings around it are protected.  It was 

then.  But what ism ostly concerns m e originally is that that sam enight, thenightf rom  8:00 

to 9:00 Novem ber,1938, they arrested30,000 Jews. 
 
Eenie, m eenie, m inie, m o, you go to 
the concentration camp. They hadnotdoneanything.  They had not broken any laws, 

nothing.  But they were  Jews and they hadbad blood andthey needed to be punishedfor 

7 
 
som ething which happened in Paris when a total s
tranger shot a Germ an embassy off icial.  
T hat's whatm y f atherhad topay for.  Andhe was put in Buchenwald Concentration 
Cam p.  And it was very difficult. Im ay haveom itted to tell you thatm y parents got 

divorced, so it was m y
 
--
 
m y m o t he r re ma rri e d a
nd I hada stepfather.  But the arrest of  
my
 
--
 
was m y real biological father, and he was the one who went to the concentration 
cam p, simply becausehe was Jewish, sim ply because that meant he had bad blood, and 

sim ply it m eant we need to get rid of him.  And so we
 
--
 
we had to live with a stigm aof  the 
bad blood.  And f rom  then on things
 
--
 
we thought that things between 1933 and 1938 
were bad. They got a lot worse.  Everything we liked, everything we enjoyed was 

forbidden.W e weren't allowed to go and see am ovie. W e weren't allowed to go and go 

to theater. W e weren't allowed to do anything.  You becam eembraced by hatredof  

people thatdidn't like you. So
 
--
 
Jen Ciardelli: And there was also, during that period, af ter Kristallnacht,m aybe in 
'39, where you experiencedforced labor, where you had to start
 
--
 
BobBehr:W ell, personally, the Nazis found laws or established laws which made 
lif eeven more diff icult. For exam ple, they initiated a rule that anybody between the age of 

15 andI think it was
 
65 had to goand work.  And the way this works , it's not that you work 
in order to earn a living.  T hat was notthe Nazi purpose. They wantedf ree labor. W ehad 

to report
 
--
 
I was, what, 17 years old.  Ihad toreport to an off ice every m orning andthey
 
assigned you work whi ch you had to do.  Usually labor, heavy m anual labor.  I rem em ber 

two things I had to do.  I got a sack of coal and had to bring them tothebuildings where 

they had central heating f rom  the trucktothebuilding and the
 
--
 
but the otherone, I was 
m uch worse. W e had to take bricks andbring them  to construction sites.  Wedidn'thave 

in the 1930sall those trains you seetoday.  In thosedays it was m anual labor who 

brought them aterial which them asons needed by handand Jews were the ones who 

im mediately did that.  And then som ething happens. I'm going to jum p now.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Please.
 
BobBehr: And that isanybody know what happened in Septemberof  1939?  
T hank you very m uch. Yes, yes.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Invasion of Poland.
 
Bob 
Behr:T he war broke out. TheGermans m arched intoPoland in Septem ber of 
1939. W hythey didthis and how they did this, I really don't have time to go intothis.  

Suff ice it to say that the Germ ans marched into Poland and thef reePolish country was 

su d
denly a German colony, with all the laws and they had enorm ousam ount of  Jewish 
people there who were now all saddled with the
 
--
 
t he  an t i
-
Jewish laws which the Germ an 
Jews had already experiencedfor anum ber of  years. And sothe
 
--
 
but you know how 
peop

let me give you m y parents, m y stepfather andm y m other, when they heard 
thatthe Germ ans marched intoPoland,they also heard on
 
--
 
and read in thenewspapers 
or heardf rom f riends that theBritish and theFrench told the Germ ans if they don't get out 

of  Poland in 24 hours, we're going to be in astateof  war betweenGerm any andBritain 

and France.  And of course the Germ ans didn't get out, andby 4:00 in the afternoonon 

the3rd of Septem ber,1939, we were at war.  Andm y parents were happy.  Oh
,m y go sh , I 

rem em ber them , they were sayin g, that is the bestthing since green grass that we were at 

war.  You will see the
 
--
 
I was wondering, I was old enoughtounderstand, but Ididn't 
know wh y they were so happy abouta war.  T hey said well, because
 
the Britishand the 
French will destroy Germany and six m onthsf rom now Hitler will be history.  Well, you 

8 
 
know and I know and she knows that it was
 
--
 
Hitler began to win every battle.  By the time 
1942, 80% of Europe,80% were all Germ anoccupied, whether it was Greece, Bulgaria, it 
wa s
 
--
 
Hitler began towin ever ywhere and our lif e became considerably worse.  For the 
f irst tim eI was hungry.  Before that, there was always enough food. But now thatthe war 

had started, we had Ration cards. And potatoes
 
were rationedandbread were rationed 
andthe Jews got some Ration cards.  But if  the Germ ans gotfour eggs a week, the Jews 

got two.  If  the Germ ans got one pound of butter a week, we got 250gram s.  And so it was 

a time where we began tophysically suffer.Bef ore that, you sufferedm entally.  Butnow 

you began to also suffer physically.  It was very bad. 
 
Jen Ciardelli: And
 
--
 
and youm entioned1942.  Andagain, so many stories. If  I 
m ay m ove us in 1942,July of 1942, things got worse f or yourfam ily.
  
Your f am ily was 
arrested.
 
BobBehr: Yeah.  My
 
--
 
in 1942m y fam ily, the Gestapo becam eand arrested all of 
u s.  It's a  ve ry
 
--
 
they didn't com e because we were Jewish.  T hat's not why they cam e.  
T hey had good reasons.  W hathappened is thatm y m other h
elped som ebody escape 
f rom  Germany.  That was a thing punishable very harshly, if  you help somebody to 

escape. T here were only aboutthree of fourneutral countries. Everybody else was 

invol ved in the war.  And it so happened thatm y m other knew a priest
 
who lived in
 
--
 
who 
lived in the areaof  Constance and if you look at the Germanm ap, you see that Constance 

is within spitting distance of Swit zerland, which Switzerland, of  course, was neutral and so 

tom akea long story short, that
 
--
 
m y m other had an 
address and she gave that woman 
theaddress. T he woman m ade it to Switzerla nd, sitsdown, writes a postcard and writes 

on thepostcard on the bottom and says, " If itwouldn't befor you, I wouldn't be here.  I am  

f ree and I have beautiful sunshineand life isgreat."   Okay?  Of course, the Gestapo reads 

thatand says aha, Mrs.
 
Behr
 
isthe one who helped that woman escapeto Switzerland 
andherethey were.  And so in July of 1942 they cam e and arrested all of us. 
 
Now, at that time the killing in the gas chamber has already started. T he killing of  
the Jews in the gas cham ber started in 1941, the year bef ore.  Allmy relati ves
 
--
 
Jen Ciardelli: That was your cane. Here,I'll get it. 
 
BobBehr: You have to help me.
 
Jen Ciardelli:  Here we go.
 
Bob Behr:  
All m y relatives are killed. T he deportation started in '41when they 
shipped the people toAuschwitz and gassedthem . And soby '42 itwas already standard 

practice,but we were not sentto Auschwitz t o the gas chambers. Neitherm y f ather,m y 

ste pfa the
r, m y mother, nor I. T he reasonfor this was ver y sim ple.  Since m yf ather, my 
biological father, had beena volunteerf or the emperor in1914,they would not gasthose 

relatives
 
--
 
veterans and/or his relatives.  Sowe were saved by thever y f actthat m y
 
fa the r
 
--
 
father, who whenhe volunteeredf or theemperor inW orldW ar I, had no idea that 
he would save
 
--
 
that this action would savehis
 
--
 
our lives.  Of  course it was years later.  
Anyway, the bottom  line is we were not sent to Auschwit z. W e were senttoa little town in 

a country thatdoesn't exist anym ore.  It's now called T erezin and the city is calledT erezin 

andthe country is the Czech Republic.  It used to be Czechoslovakia.  But that'sanother 

long story.  It doesn't exist anym ore.  And sohere we were suddenly in a concentration 

c a m p.
 
Now, there aretonsof  books written about concentration camp. Som e were bad, 
som e were worse, som e were impossible.  It was
 
--
 
suddenly you are taken out of
 
--
 
ju s t  

9 
 
take yourself outof  your normal lif e. You goto work, you f ix your dinner, you leada 
normal life. In the concentration cam p there's nothing normal because you don'thave 

anything to say. T here were tons of Jewish people in that concentration camp but the 

power rested with theseven SS guys.  Those seven guys ran the show.  Couldn't you?  

No, you couldn'tbecause they had weapons. And we hadnothing. And so those seven 

SS guys ran the show of  60,000people.  Now, perm it me to give you a
 
--
 
a couple of  
words aboutthe 60,000. 
 
T heresienstadt used to be Austria Hungarian garrison town.  AustriaHungary didn't 
exist anym ore.  It becam epartof  Czechoslovakia thatdidn'texist anym ore because Hitler 

occupied it in March of 1939.  He took thef reedom  of the Czech's awa y.  And so that 

whole area wasf reefor the Germ ans to do what they want and they did andthey made a 

concentration cam pout of it.  Specif ically f orolder people, people over 65.  And som e of  

the younger people who were especially deserving.  And we were especially deserving 

because m y 
father volunteeredto f ightfor tem p rear. T hat savedm y lif ebecause it 
elim inatedthe gas cham berform y f am ily becauseof  theaction m yfather took when he 

volunteered tof ight the war and had no idea that years later it would save his life.
 
Anyway
 
--
 
Jen Ciardelli: And conditions were quite hard, but there was anopportunity 
to
 
--
 
there was a work opportunity that cam eup.  Can you tell us about that?
 
BobBehr: Yes, yes, Ican. W hathappened is that the war was goin g on. The Air 
Force, the Am erican
 
and BritishAir Force were bom bing the hell out of  Germ any.  Berlin 
was hit ver y badly.  And am ong thebuildingswhich was hit was theheadquarters of the 

SS. The very peoplewho were boundand determ ined toelim inatethe Jews.  T heir 

headquarters was totally destroyed.  I can give you the address.W ouldn't mean anything 

to you. And so the leader of that SS, a guy with the name of Heinrich Himmler went tothe 

Germ an authorities and saidhey, they destroyed the
 
--
 
the Am ericans destroyed m y 
headquarters.
  
I needan office. And can you gi ve m ea piece of land?  Andtom ake a 
long story short, the Germ ans give him  apiece of  land and saying here, you canbuild 

yourselves a new headquarters, barracksand then there's
 
--
 
the guy said thank you, that's 
what I
 
wanted. And then they came toT heresienstadt, to the concentration cam p where 
m y f am ily andI were, and said we need some volunteersto go there and build that guy a 

new headquarters.  And then they addeda sentence. Andf or that sentence isthe reason 

I'm  sitting here with you because they said, "If  you volunteer to go to that place where they 

build the new headquarters, if you volunteerto go, we wi ll not evacuate you."   Now, in 

parentheses everybody knew what the word" evacuate" m eant.  Itm eantdeath
.  It's 

another long story.  You'll have to come back.  Anywa y, ever ybody s aid if  you want to be 

evacuatedf rom T heresienstadt to Auschwitz,  that means they're goi ng to kill you. 
 
So I volunteered. I volunteeredand they said we will not evacuate your f ol
ks.   I  
thought well, that'sm y chance to do this. SoI volunteered. Andthat was the worst tim e in 

all these years, since 1933, that Iexperienced.  It was sobad, sohard, so diff icultthatf or 

thef irsttim e I gave up.  I was wil ling to die.  Igot ver y sick.  It was 1944, bitter cold in 

winter in 1944, Ihad a vitamin def iciency disease called impetigo and then accom panied 

by high tem peratures and youfeel just aboutas bad as you can im agine.  And Ididn't want 

to live anym ore. I didn't want to live 
anym ore. 
 
It is now '44. Ihad it f or 11 years already thatI lived underthis Hitler andm y bad 
blood and no chance to ever get out and in '44T war we knew, but we didn't have any 

10
 
 
detailsbecause the Jews were not allowed to have any means of  com municati
on. 
 
So I was standing on the barbed wire f enceone
 
--
 
tha t wa s la te
 
--
 
either late 
Novem ber orearly January, I don't really remem ber.  I think it was early January.  And 
anybody who is ever beento Europe in January knows it can bepretty lousy weather. 
 
B ut  
we were standing there in the inside thebarbed wire and we lookedoutand there was 

another guy andI.  It was a Sunday becauseon Sunday we didn't have to work.  And what 

we saw there was som ething very unbelievable. W e saw a huge trek of  people with every 

kind of moveablefurniture, wagons, baby carriage, anything, and these people were going 

outside the concentration cam p.  God knows where they were going, but it wasn't very 

diff icult tof igure out,and I'll tellnew a m inute.  And I looked and I asked this colleague of  

m ine, the prisoner who was with m e,"W ho are thesepeople."   He said thoseare 

Germ ans. W ell, yeah,they're Germans. ButI don't have all the time in the world, but I will  

tell you, what was remarkable was where they going, where 
they're com ing from .  These 

people were outside who were Germannationals were going f rom  east to west.  Now, that 

doesn'tm ean anything to you. So letm eexplain thisto you. In1941 Hitler attacked the 

Soviet Unionand theGerm ans occupiedm arching f rom  west toeast occupied.  Now all of  

a sudden thesepeople which we sa w walking, they were going f rom east to west towards 

the American, towards the British, towardsf reedom . They didn't want to be captured by 

the Russians. And the guy who explain that had to me and saiddon't you see, the 

Germ ans aref leeing f rom  the Russians. T hey're goin g f rom  east towest, f rom Moscow to 

Frankf urt and like that. AndI thoughtby m yself , you know what?  Maybe you ought to live 

a little bit longer.  If it'sthat close
 
that the Russians arealready com ing and chasing the 
Germ ans away, thenm aybe the war wil l beover ver y shortl y.  Andin closing, I can tell you 

yes, that was
 
--
 
we wer e evacuatedf rom  our concentration cam p in problem February 
1945. W e were returned to T heresienstadtto our base camp. Andon the5thof  March, 

the Soviet Arm y liberated the camp and we were suddenly f ree.  My parents, due to m y 

volunteer work, survi ve d the concentration cam p. T hey died shortly af ter,but atthat time 

they were still ali ve f rom m y volunteering to go there saved their lif e.  And the war was 

over and we were f reed.  And that's the story. 
 
Jen Ciardelli: Bob, I
 
--
 
I wonder if  you can
 
--
 
youm ention your biological father who 
was f orced tof leeGerm any in order to get out of Buchenwald. At the endof the war he 

ultim ately ended up in the UnitedStates andat the endof  the war you tried to reconnect 

with him .  Can you talk a littlebit about that? 
 
BobBehr: Yeah. T hewar was over.  It was 1946 whenPresidentT rum an 
arrange
d  
--
 
I don'thave time to explain to you the Am erican imm igration law which is nota 
ver y good law.  It's a pretty bitter law.  Lotsof restrictions. Butanyway, during the war it 

was alm ost im possible to go to Am ericabecause they had a new rule
 
--
 
had a
 
new rule 
thatevery Germ an Jew needs to have a sponsor. W ell, a sponsor,that'sa guy with a 

fam ily who is responsible let's say f orthe Behrf am ily if  we cam e toAm ericaf rom soup to 

nuts,everything. W hether that'sm edical, education, you nam e it. And to get a sponsor 

was the only wa y you could getanauthorization to com e to the United States. W ell, I 

went to the em bassy, the Am erican Em bassy in about 1939,af ter Kristallnacht and tried to 

ge t
 
--
 
andpersuadedm y m other and I andm y stepf ather could
 
go to Am ericabut we didn't 
have a sponsorand tosex offender thatfellf lat. So what did you ask m e?
 
Jen Ciardelli: So your father made it to the UnitedStates after the war.
 
Bob Behr:  Yeah, m y father got
 
--
 
IthinkI told you, on Kristallnachthe wa
s  o n e of  

11
 
 
the30,000 Jews who got arrested,put in the concentration cam pand he gotout.  And the 
wa y he got out is thatnot theGermans whostoppedhim f rom getting out. It's the country 

letting them  in.  Andhe was lucky he got permission to leavef or C
uba, and he did.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Great.  So we're going to close the program now. There's never 
enough time to hear all of the stories andexperiences youhave.  It is our tradition in
 
F i rs t  
Person
 
that we alwa ys  gi ve our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
the last word.  So in just am inute I'll turn back 
to Bobfor hisf inal words.  But whenhef inishes, we're going to have Joel come and join 

usf or a photograph where Bob will be on thestage and the whole group will be behind.  

So we invite you to stay f or that. And also, if you have a questionfor Bobor would just like 

to com eupand shakehis hand or say hi, please stay after andBob wil l be here and you 

can com e and check in with him .
 
Obviously there's somuch that we didn't cover.  You returnedto Germ any after as 
an intelligence off icer and therearem any stories aboutTexas and cowboy hats and lotsof  

things.  So go online, you can readm oreabout him . ButI'd like to thank all of  you very 
m uchf orbeing here. Wehope that you cancom e back and visit another
 
F i r s t  Pe
rs o n
 
program . Again, they run everyW ednesday andT hursday.  And Bob, I have known you 
now f or close to ten years.  You are an am azing individual and I learn something every 

tim e I hear you speak.  Andthe power
 
--
 
theexperiences you share I thinkare po
werf ul 
andespecially during this, which is the weekof  Days of  Rem em brance, it's just a real 

blessing that you've been able to share your story with us.  So on that note, I'm  going to 

turn it back to youf or ourf inal words.
 
Bob Behr: W ell, m y f inal word
 
is really ver y si m ple.  What you see in f rontof  you is 
an old used 95
-
year
-
old man and
 
--
 
who drags him selff rom  hishome tothe museum to 
talk to you. W hy do Ido this? W hy do I sit here instead of being in a warm , nice 

apartm ent where we live and talking to you?W ell, I'll tell you. W ewon't li ve m uch longer.  

W earem arked.  All the people whoare survivors wil l be gone in a short time.  So who's 

going to take over? W ho's going tobe theone who spreads m y story, anyone's, survivor 's 

sto ry?   It's 
you. W eare totally, utterly dependent on you.  And it'sa great job what you 

need to do. W hen you see something which is wrong, don't go away and say it's not m y 

problem . If  you see som ething, inm y case anti
-
Sem itic, som ebody who uses spray paint 
to  w
rite som ething ona synagogue, don't say that there's nothing Ican do about it. Goup, 
have the guts and say, " Don't do that."  Don'tdo that. T hat'sm y m ission to you.  I'm  going 

to saddle you with a job to do, todefend liberty, f reedom , andhappiness
 
on ourbehalf .  
W e won't be there. W e won't
 
--
 
wi ll not live that long.  So if  you can, if you will, f ollow the 
leadanddefend what's good and right. Andthat'sthe reason I'm  here.
 
Jen Ciardelli: Thank you.  Thank you.
 
(Applause).
