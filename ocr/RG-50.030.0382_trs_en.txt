Questi on:  I would li ke you 
to be gin by a ski ng bot h of you t o s t
ate your date  of birt h, where wer e 
you bor n --  a nd we™ll start  wi th you, Belle. 
BZ:  Ans wer:  My na me  is  Bell e Ma yer  Zec k. 
I wa s bor n in Port Henr y, Ne w York, on La ke  
Ch amplain. Wh en I was about si
x years old, my  fa mily moved 
to Suffern, New York, here in 
Rockla nd Count y. So I  went
 all t hrough the  publi c  sc
hools in Suffer n, atte nd
ed Syracuse Uni versity 
and gr aduate d fr om Ford
ha m La w sc hool i n 1940. 

Q:  Bill? 

WZ :  I am William Allen Zeck, born
 March 3rd, 1915. I grew up 
on 110th Street  between Fift h 
and Lennox Av enue, at the 
nort h end of Ce ntral  Pa rk. 
I attended grammar school, 
Townse nd- Harris Hall Hi gh Sc hool , New Yor k Uni v
ersity in University Heights, and the 
Ne w York University La w Sc hool, fr om wh ich I 
graduate d fr om i n J une of 1936, and I  ha ve  
been a lawyer all of 
these years si nce then. 
Q:  I want you to talk a little b
it about your fa mily background a
nd sort of values
 that you grew 
up wi th. And als o per haps  te
ll me a bit about why you de
cided t o become a l awyer . 
BZ:  We ll, my pa r ents  were  both i m mi gra nt s Œ both
 came to this country,
 my father sli ghtl y 
be for e t he  turn of t he  
century, my  mo ther at 
the turn of the century. 
They were married here 
and my fat her was an upst ate dair y far mer , 
but  my pare nts  ha d four  chil dre n and one  
coul dn't ma ke a  livi ng. For four
 chil dre n doi ng dair y far ming,
 i f you know a n ythi ng about

the upstate New Yor k or Ver mon
t dairy farmers, they are very
 poor people . And so he c a me  
to Suffern a n d we nt i nto busi
ness, but always had a farm. I 
was  the youngest , my el des t  
sibli ng was  a  la wyer a nd perhaps  t hat unc onscio
usl y had s o me i n flue nce  on my goi ng to law 
school . I  was  als o a  c hild of t he Depre ssion a nd 
it  wa s quite  cl e ar, it  wa s ma de quit e cl ea r to 
all of us t hat  we  ha d to ea rn 
a living when we got out of sch
ool . It was  all  right t o go to 
colle ge, but i t ha d t o be  a pur posi ve  ve nture . And 
I wa s t old tha t  I c oul dn't  be  an actr ess . I  
wa s al so tol d  I had no t ale nt whats oeve r as  a 
teac her , s o I  ki nd of  ba cke d i nto the l a w, 
seemed to be  all th
at  was left for me. 
 
01: 05: 21 

 

Q:  Isn't that sort of unus
ual  t hough, for  a woma n of th
at time to go
 into law? 
BZ:  It was, it was. There we ren't many wome n 
who we nt i nto la
w at  that  
time, it wa
s sti ll a  
man's fi eld, I suppose it 
still is today. But actually
, I came along just
 at the right time because two 
years  a ft er I  graduate d we were  at  
war and all of t he men,
 all  of the  la wyers , wer e being dra fte d. I 
think they were the first ones being drafted, so
 that  not onl y wa s I welc
o me in Wa shi ngt on, I  and 
other  wo me n  la wy ers,  wh at fe w the r e wer e ,  we we re
 rat her  sought-a fter. Of cour se a fter  t he wa r 
wa s over  a n d we  ret urne d t o our  pri v ate li ves , eve r yt
hi ng went  ba ck to the  ol
d, t o t he ol d order  a nd 
wome n were  not s ought -a fte r a nd 
wo me n could not get jobs for whic
h t heir  training and experience 
had e qui ppe d t he m ver y well  duri
ng those years of World War Two. 
Q:  Any parti cul ar c halle nges  that  you underwen
t  in ter ms  of la w a n d la w sc hool  in those  earl y 

years?

BZ:  In my early years I  can'
t  re me mb er a n y o t her  th an  mo
ney, and I certainly was not 
i mpoveris he d i n t he sens e that 
I  was helped a great deal wit h 
scholars hip mone y t o war ds t uiti on. 
And t her e were al ways  peopl e ar ound
 me to see that I didn't starve. 
But  thi n gs were ver y  tight for 
ever ybody. 

Q:  Anything i n partic ular  you wa nt t o add a bou
t your  fa mil y or your values , t h e way you were 
raised, that might 
have prepared you 
a little bit for the rather cha
llenging work ahead of you? 
BZ:  No, exc ept  t hat t he  wor k et
hic  was  ve r y str ong in our house .
 I  mean we a l wa ys ha d c hor e s, 
far  more one rous  than ou
r  chil dre n or our  gra ndchi ldren. And 
aside from the work ethic, I ca n't 
think of muc h. The first  t hing I  he ar
d about Ger ma ny, a s I  rec al l , wa s 
i n high s chool . M y  father use d 
to re ad the papers  a nd he  had 
fa mil y i n Hungary. I t  was  the n
 Œ it ha d bec o me Czec hoslovaki a 
duri ng Worl d Wa r One, but  he  had fa
mil y a nd he wa s dee ply c onc erne d,
 as were mo st of the people 
we  kne w, de eply c onc erned about  Hitl
er. My mother had no 
fa mil y i n Europe so that  it  didn't  hit  her  
quite  as  dee p ly a s it  hit  my fat her , but  she  too 
wa s very c onc erned about  wh
at was happening to the 
Jews in Europe. I can
't say it was a dail
y topic of conversatio
n. It was not until 
I got to 
Washington 
that I  became very i mmersed 
in Germany and in the war.

Q:  Let™s just, I gue ss, 
ask Bill similar questionsŠ 
WZ:  My pare nts  a l so e migr ate d, 
they from Russia in the 
ye ar 1900. Not  t oget h
er  Œ they met over 
here . M y fat her got  to li ve the United State s, as  he 
put it, just in time  to 
unde rstand t hat  President

William McKinley was 
a ssas sinat ed s hortl y a fter  he got here
. My father was i n t he coffee and tea 
busi nes s. He  us ed to i mport gree n 
coffee, blend it, roast 
it, package it, sell it
 bot h at  whol esale  and 
retail. The same also with
 tea . Not r oa sting or Œ but he  would bl
end tea and sell tea, largely to retail 
cust omers. Our coffee r oaster, 
at 110th Street, between Park 
and Ma dis on Ave nue , consta ntly 
spewed forth, every 
20 minutes, a blast of wonderfully s mellin
g coffee, which disp
ersed in the air, 
and it was the best advertising he 
c oul d pos sibl y do. It woul d s pre
a d over  a  period of about  five  
bloc ks . We  c hildre n were  mysel f  a nd t wo si sters . Be
lle talked about the disc
ipline of hard work and 
that was ver y much our disci pline.
 I f I ha d t o spec ify a n obj ecti ve 
of my par ents , bot h of the m felt 
that t heir  thr ee children, r egar d
less of gender, should receive as
 much e duc at ion as  the y c oul d 
abs orb. So that Œ I t ol d you a bou
t my  college degrees; my  older si
ster  was a graduate of NYU at 
Wa shi ngt on Square . My you
ngest  sist er gr aduate d fr om Hunt er
 Col lege and also got a Master™s 
Degree in addition to he
r Bachelor™s Degree. As 
far as the family beliefs 
are concerned, which I 
certai nly thi nk was  i mpounded int o
 me , and it  was t he busine ss of 
honest y, i ntegr ity. M y mother  
took care of all of 
the things she felt that she want ed in her 
chil dren. My fat her wante d t o be sure  
that all of the fa mily bills
 were paid, regularly paid
, paid on time. I think th
ings that ke
pt him awake 
at night, if at a
ll, other than possibly
 health factors, was getting his 
bills paid. And th
is was a very 
i mport ant  di scipli ne  and challe nge be caus e we  too 
went  thr ough t he Depre s sion years . During t hose 
years  I  ent er ed colle ge  at  19 i n 
1930 a nd gra duated coll ege  a nd la
w sc hool i n 1936
, but I worked 
regul arly ea c h day with my fat her  in hi s busi nes s 
be caus e he nee ded the hel
p, so that this was the 
basic  influe nce, I t hink, 
that pr obabl y has c arrie d 
me thr ough thi s ei ght h or 
ni nth de cade of my li fe , 
whichever it is. And the bu
siness of honesty and straight talkin
g and integrity is 
something that I 
have always looked fo r a
nd felt and tried to practice,
 even in the business 
of politics, if you will.

Q:  [Tec hni cal c onversa tion: Let me Œ you kn
ow what Bill? One thin
g I suggest Œ you're 
gripping your shi rtsle eve  here .] 

WZ: I'msorry. 

Q:  [Tec hni cal c onversa tion: You're drivi
ng hi m cra zy be cause he
 t hought it  wa s hi s 
microphone. You can't do that, 
that woul d be ver y helpful.]  
WZ :   Ok . 

Q:  Per haps you can tell me
 what you knew ab
out wh at was happ
e ning i n Eur o pe. 
WZ :  In Germany? Well, I did en
ter college in 1930, 
and Hitler was beginnin
g to scratch around 
and ma ke hi s pr ese nce  fe lt in
 one fas h ion or  anothe r in
 1931 a n d '32. Hinde nber g
1
 was in 
charge at government, H
itler was pushing in that direction. 
I didn't know to
o much about the 
pre-1930 period, during Hitler's 
Munich and post-Munich, becaus
e it wasn't part of any of 
my st udies , a nd I wa s ver y much
 involved both with the work
 I did at home  and with my  
great  de sire  t o play s hort s top for  the New Yor k
 Ya nke es and al so be  
a me mber of the United 
State s Da vis  Cup t ennis  te a m, yo
u see . But  once  we  got  int o t he  c ollege le vel  i n our  his t or y 
courses and our political 
science courses, we kn
ew what was happenin
g in Germany, and it 
wa s neither pleas ant  nor pleas ura ble;  but  act uall y, we
 di dn't r egard it  a s a  gr eat t hreat  unt il in 

the middle '30s we began to re
alize that the H
itler progra m was a definite
 threat to the Jews 
of Germany and when we began 
t o r e alize also i n t he mi ddl e 
'30s his  appetit e for  s prea di ng 
pan- Ger manis m, we bega n t o be ver y unhappy
 about wh at was happ
ening in Germany.

Bell e, as she told yo
u, had some  family left in Hunga
ry. As  far as I knew, none of my  
father's  fa mily Œ he wa s the yo
ungest child Œ came  here in 
1900, so we  didn't have any 
fa mi ly that  I  kne w of in Europe
 and we di dn't ha ve  that  to 
c onc ern us . My music  was  very 
i mport ant  in our  home. Under  dure ss I  studie d 
t he  violi n for six ye ars. Bot h my si ster s 
played the pi ano. My mot her ha
d a lovely singing voice and we
 did a good deal of singing 
and so forth. Musi
c 's  been ver y i mport ant t o us . My fa
ther used to buy 
numbers of Œ he 
love d t he  Ital ian t enors , particul arly Carus o,
2
 and he love d s o me b
eauti ful  te nors  who we re 
cant ors . We  had all  ki nds  of mus i c i n
 t he house  dur ing that  peri od.  
Q:  Actually, you bring up so
met hing that  I gues s I  di dn™t a sk Belle  about . Was  religi on 
i mport ant  in your fa mily?  
WZ:  Reli gion?  Yes, my pa rents were  Cons ervati ve
 Je ws. During my  sc hool
 year s  I woul d go t o 
grammar school from nine
 until three. I would come
 home at three, I would 
have a snack and fro m 
four  to five I  woul d pla y t he viol
in, wi th my  mo ther glar
ing at  me  to se e t ha t  
I was givi ng her a full 
hour, except  for fi ve minutes
 s he  all o wed me  t o go t o t he bat hr
oom. At  six o'clock 
I went  t o He bre w 
school, the Harlem 
Hebrew Institute at 111t
h Street between Lexingto
n and Park Avenue, and I 
spe nt t w o hours t her e e ac h day. So t ha t  thi s wa s 
a full day of education fo
r kids of that era and 
education was t he pri nci pally i m
portant thing in rais
ing c hil dr en of t hos
e years.  I was Bar 
Mitzva he d at  the  usual  a g e, and gradually a fter  Ba
r Mitzvah I worked my wa
y out from under both 
the viol in and He bre w instructi on. 
I was fi nished with all of that. 
But we  ha d i n t hos e t er ms  with a  
pretty full Hebrew education. As 
a matter of fact , I can probabl y 
sit here and write Yiddish while 
you s pea k Englis h, writi ng Yi ddish 
a nd translati n g a s we  go al ong. 
But I'm sure the scratching of 
the pe n woul d bot her t he  gentl e man out t here .

Q:  So  you Œ did the fact th
at you kne w  Yi ddis h or some Ger ma n he lp you lat er on?  
WZ :  Ye s, yes. As a matter of fact, I had fi ve 
years of Fr ench. Fr ench 
was  the  la nguage we  all  
studi ed then, but I  ha d a year of
 Ge r m an i n colle ge  and bet we e n 
the German and 
the English, I 
ma naged to get along in Nu remb erg.
 Not if I wa s interr ogating a w
itness, not without the presence 
of a n i nter pr eter, a transl ator, but I do un
derstand a good deal 
of the language, yeah. 
Q:  And I 'd li ke t o pick up wi
t h what you wer e doi ng i n Wa sh
i ngt on. You s aid t hat a fter  la w 
school  you we nt t o Was hington?  

BZ:  Well, two years after I graduated fr om law sc
hool, I  went  to work in
 the Ge neral Counsel's 
Offic e of t he  Unite d Stat e s Treas ur y a nd th
e  Ge ner al Counsel, t h
en Randol f Poll( ph), 
assigned me  to a fairly new 
burea u c al l ed Foreign Funds Co
ntr ol. It wa s i n char ge of 
admini steri n g t he Trading Wit h t he Enemy act
. And that  act , of cours e, as  you know, 
forbade all communications , tr
ansmittals, remittan
ces Œ any de aling wh
atsoever  Œ with 
Ger ma n y. Then, as Ger ma ny s u
cce s sivel y occ upied Austri a, Pol and, Scandina via , t he 
Benelux countries, and France
, wit h e ach invasi on the Tr
a ding Wit h t he  Ene my act was 
exte nde d t o t hat countr y, so t hat
 by 1941, be for e I  got  to th
e  Tr easur y, all  of Europe  and 
Britain was fairly well Œ it was 
insulated to the extent that  we coul d insulate them, to the 
exte nt t hat  we c oul d prevent Hitl er from gett in
g any use of Germany's 
exter nal assets. Those 
exter nal  ass e ts, I  ma y t e ll you
, were mainly held by I.G. 
Far ben, the gi ant  chemi cal 
company which ha d offic es a nd

xperi ence i n t he first  Worl d Wa

assets which 
they had in t his countr y had be
e n vest ed by the Ali en Pr oper t

early as  1936, the y ma de  a Œ 
t he y began a c oncerte d e ffort  to tra ns fer  out any holdi ngs  
whi ch they had here  into t he 
na me s of nomi nees  who woul d cl
oak their assets for them. I 
wa s, in the  c ours e of my wo

 I  wa s a ssi gne d to th
e investigation of 
German assets in this 
country, specifically 
General Analine and Film
, which wa s, I think, 
their largest  hol ding i n t h is c ountry.  
 
01: 25: 03 

 
But they had so ma ny other par
tici pati ons  a nd holdings  in s o 
many companies, I won't recite 
them all. And then they, if 
the y didn't own t hre e nomi nees
, thr o ugh Ameri ca ns, thr ough 
Swiss , i f t he y didn't  own contr olli ng or ma
jority interest in

for me d ne w corporati ons wit h nomi ne es for t hei
r half interests and with
 the other  hal f be ing 
held by t he Ameri can co
mpany, mai n ly Sta ndar d Oil . I  start e
d to say that it 
wa s Œ t hat where  
they di dn't have  a dire ct or i ndir ect particip

arra nge me nts  with s o me 
of the leading companies in this
 country which permitt

and, of cours e, i n t he  first  insta nce  it was di ff

Q:  Wh enever you're re
ady. OK, Bill,
 you were? 
BZ:  Bill was talking ab
out  the se c artels  a n d I 'd like t o s ay 
a word about  thi s. Cart els are not  
busi nesses, t hey're arrangements
 or a g ree ments which divi de  
up markets, fi x prices, control 
producti on. The  wa y t his  is done
 is through the use of patent
s. No w, Standard Oil of Ne w 
Jersey is a good example. It 
had had long-s
tanding alliances with I.
 G. Farben, which went 
bac k t o Worl d Wa r One, and th
ey not onl y had the se c artel  a
rra nge me nts  but the y ha d j oi nt 
owner shi p of about  10 compan
ies in this country other than Ge neral Anal ine and Film, 
whi ch I me ntione d. In t h e ‚20s , 
Standard Oil agreed to give  
I. G.  Farben the patents and 
distri buti on r ights  for t he producti on of synthetic
 gasoli ne. The y wer e wa y ahea d i n t er ms  of 
resear ch, way ahead of I .
 G. Farben. In return, they were
 Œ and the right 
to t he Europea n  
mar ket , whe r e s ynt hetic  gas oline  wa s  ba dly neede
d. In ret urn, t hey were
 s u ppose d t o ge t not 
onl y t he pate nts for  the  de velopme nt of synthetic  rubber , but  the y wer e s uppose d t o get 
whate ver know-how I . G. Far b
en had in the production of 
synthetic rubber. All of our 
rubber came  fr om Malaysia, 90
 percent of it, and when the 
Japs attacked, t he Japanese 
attacked us at Pearl Harbor
, we found our rubb
er  mar ket s cut off 
completely. In the 
meanti me Œ and the perni ciousne
ss of these cartels becomes a
pparent when you realize that 
fr om, oh, the middle '2 0s, to as 
late  as  1938, Sta nda rd Oil  ke pt 
pressi ng Farben t o give t h e m 
thos e pate nts  and t o give t he m what  know-how 
t hey ha d, beca us e whe ne ver  our  own r ubber 
comp anies,  Go od year and Firestone for example, 
t ried t o do re s earch in producing synthe tic 
rubber, Standard Oil would say 
to them, ﬁOh, now,  don't spen

the ba g, we 'r e going t o ge t the m;  
it 's  just that t he y 'r e havi ng

of its size, bu
t I don't think 
people know how far afie

the '30s , Far ben pr oduce d 90

of a  pi ece  of equi pme nt, of ar ma me nt  t o whi c

that Hit l er could not have pos sibl y wa ged wa

I think if you 
have any mo re questions, this wa
s I . G. Far ben pr epari ng for  
war . Then ther
e came a point  
when I. G. Farbe n deci de d t o 
buil d it s fourt h synthetic r ubber
 plant at Auschwitz. Th ey did 
it because of the availabi
l ity of c he ap l abor  in 
the for m of concentrati o
n  ca mp  i n mate s.  It is  
estimated that in the constructi
on of t his enor mous pl ant , i n
 t h e c onst ructi on al one, 25,000 
worker s die d . The se  wor k ers wer e ver y, ver y 
badly treat ed and t he pl
ant was run with the 
help of the SS. In ot her  words ,
 t her e were SS guar d s in e ver y 
pa rt of the fa ct ory. Not onl y 
that, but the SS  brou
ght the concentration camp inmate
s from Ausc hwitz t o t he fact ory 
ever y day and I . G. Far ben gave
 t hem receipts. They paid them
, they paid the SS a doll ar per 
ma n, a  dollar  a da y, 75 c e nts 
for  a woman and 50 cen
ts for a healthy chil

coul d work. The n t he  SS compl aine d t hat it  wa
s  t o o danger ous  to move
 these people over 
suc h a  long r oad, t hat  the r e wa
s  a  da nger that t he y c oul d e s
cape, no matter how ma ny guards 
they put on. So Fa
rben, i n c onj unction wit h 
t he SS, rec o mme nde d t hat  Bir kenau be  bui lt. It  
was closer to Auschwitz proper
 and they built the crematoriu
m, the gas cham
bers and the 
crematorium right into the build
ing so that  after the inmates, and there were French and 
Belgian and Gypsies ther e, so that  after they 
were  gass ed, t heir  bodies  
could be  di spose d of 
i mmediat ely in t he ovens. That
's why Bir kenau ha s  al wa ys be

Q:  And as  a woma n, 
as a young wo ma n, were you we lcom

BZ:  We ll, by and large 
I  was t reated very well . The St ate De
part ment i n Was hi ngt on was  al wa ys  
very s upe rcil ious . These  hyphe nate d na mes , you 
know, who wer e very s u percili ous pe ople , but  I 
think that they were 
nast y to everybody, not 
just women and theyŠ 
WZ :  Still are. 

BZ:  And i t  wa s a  matt er of de gree . I ' m sur e 
that wome n wer e on a l o

but  ther e wer e cert ain 
men that came in for their di sapp
roval  als o. Now t h
e  Briti sh, bot h in 
Wa shington and in Lo

to be very supercilious, an
d they would argue a word 
in a  pr ocl a mation or  a n ordina nce . They woul
dŠs orry Œ they would ar
gue it to de ath I me an, 
whether business should be 
called a concern or 
a corporation or an entity, an
d it would just go on fo r 
hours. Of course , I  was  y

BZ:  We ll, I ha d diffi cult y getti ng a pas sport  to go
 t o London i n t he fir st pl ace . But the Se cretar y 
of the Treasury, who was 
having his own battles with
 the State Depa

didn't know me 
at all , deci de d t o ma ke  
it a cause célèbre, t he St
ate  De part me nt  coul dn't 
tell him who to send to 
London, or anywhere 
else, and he prevailed. Ther
e weren't, in retrospect, 
there weren't 
difficulties. 
Those, what difficulties I 
had as a result of gender, 
religion, perhaps 
age, I had after 
the war; I had 
after the war when I tried 
to get a job at Chase Ba
nk in thei r foreign exchan
ge, foreign trade section 
and I couldn't even get  an inter view. 
Q:   Let 's  go bac k a nd tal k t o Bill  for  a  mi nute  
about how you ca me to all 
of thi s. Aft er you wer e 
wit h t he Lend-Lease Commi ssi
on, what you were  doing?  
WZ :  After I finished my milita
ry service, in January of 
1946, I guess, I 
knew about the 
Nuremberg trials. I had 
been in uni for m as an
 ai de -de-c a mp to Ge neral  Don E. Sc ott(ph)  
when the requisition ca
me through for m
ilitary people interested 
in going to 
Nuremberg. 
Bec ause we  wer e j ust  be fore t he  end of the  war ,
 t he  Gene ral sai d  to me, ﬁ Bill , i f you wa nt to 
go to Nuremberg, I will 
let you go now. I will report you.ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁGen

go to Nure mberg, but  I  want t o get  out  of th

 I  di d get out  as  a  civil i an, t he

t o t he  Pe ntagon, I  me t 
Telford Taylor, who was still a 
colonel there and beginning 
to recruit for subsequent

Q:   Why we re you so ea ge
r  t o go to Nure mberg?  
WZ :  I was eager to go to Nure
mb erg because Œ and not only eager 
t o  go t o Nure mberg, but  e ager  
to wo rk on an I. G. Fa
r be n tria l, be cause I 'd ha d contact  w
ith it in my work 
at the Bo ard of 
Economic We lfare before I got into the Ar m

Je wi s h c ertai nly had 
something to do with my
 eager ness t o go ther e and since I  
ha d r eally be en out for we ll over 
some where  bet wee n four  and six ye ar s, I  had 
no l a w pra ctice  to go bac k t o a nd I wa s 
intere sted in goi ng 
to federal government agai
n, a n d t his see me d t he pl
ac e t o do it a nd to do, 
be part  of the pr ose cuti o n. So I  we nt over  
there and what I  found 
ther e was a few quick 
obs erva tions  I ma de . All  of t he pe
opl e  wor king on the I MT ca s e Œ 
and just  to se
t the time for 
it, this was the end of
 March of 1946 and the IMT trial 
ended in September of 1946. The 
people  wor ki ng on t he pr osec ution sta ff were  
virtually all in uniform
, either Ar my  or Air 
For ce or Na vy. The  people who worked subse
que nt proc eedings were all, e xcuse me , 
former military people now 
in civilian mufti. And 
I went over with the 
first group of lawyers 
hired for s ubsequent  proc eedi ngs  a nd t here  were
 12 of us on the ship
 which interestingly 
was called the 
General Taylor
, but apparently it wa
sn't na me d aft er Tel f ord Ta ylor. When I  
received a call to report  to the port to get on 
t he shi p I  was tol d t hat t he ship i s the USS 
Ge ner al Tay l or 
and I  sai d, ﬁ Oh, my good
ne ss, has  he  rec eived a pr omot ion,ﬂ you know, 

beca use  he 'd be en Colonel Tayl or, but obvi ous ly 
it  was  a di ffer ent Ta ylor . I n a ny e vent , we  
formed a very close kn

ere we re also some women going 
over  as st enographer s. Ther
e wer e  a  fe w for me r  Ge r ma ns  wh o wer e  goi ng  o ver as 
transl ator s. We  tal ke d a bout t he obvi ous  thi ngs
, things we'd been doin
g i n recent  years  and 
wh at we  hoped to do wh en we  
got ove r  the r e. Whe n we  di d ge
t  over  there , t here  was n 't  very 
much for us to do be
cause the I MT tri al was on, everybod

We  didn't know wh ether there wo ul

interest, Telford's interest certain
l y wa s, i n be ginni ng to res ear
ch for one kind 
of a trial or 
anot her  involving t he I.
 G. Far ben pe ople . I  di d sit  in 
for a number of days between April 
and June on the IMT ca

 the identities of the de
fendants, the people 
in t he dock, also tryi ng
 to get  or ga nize d wit h re spe ct to 
I. G. Farben. Ther
e  wer e t hen only 
two of us who wa nte d t o work

s a lawyer from Virgi nia named 
Ji m Heat h,

 who'd been a railroad la

So uthern Railroad. And we knew
, t he t hing we  di d know a s ba
c kgr ound mat t er was  Bell 's 
repor t t o t he Kil gore  Committ ee, whi c h wa s Part  
seven of that series 
of docume nts, and we  
also ha d a Pa rt 10 which detaile
d in narrative form some of the 
exhi bits  that they used. And 
then we  be gan l ooking for doc ume n
t s beca use  we  ha d r eas on t o belie ve t ha t  ther e wa s a n I . 
G.  Farben document center in 
Frankfurt. Th ere were German 
documents in Berlin. All of 
these were captured do
cuments. And there was 
one, what was the name
 of that little town 
outsi de  of Fr ankfurt , Bell e?  Down by, no, down
 by Hoec hst?  No, I 'll  thi nk of it. In a ny 
eve nt, went  t o all  of t hos e  pla ces , c oul dn't fi nd

arrive d, it se e med rea sonably cle ar t h at we  
wouldn't  ha ve  a se cond i nter nat ional  trial , 
although Telford was no
t sure  of it and I 'd e xhaus te d all  
the poss ible source s of Kil gor e

 So  I  wo rke d wit h  
Mic key, you know who 
Colonel Marcus was, he wa s the 
West Point graduate 
who went over to Is

because he didn't know the pa

He was a very col o rful fi gure, 
both in Jewish lore an

03: 27: 44 

 

 He  was  a la wy er who  was buri e d

te r Tel ford, we nt bac k a fter 
his hiring the first 12, did the 
interviewing and the hiring fo

i n t he mont hs  of Jul y and Au

we nt t o my first l ove , whi ch wa s t o find t h

I  spoke wit h ever y one of t he

well better talk to Belle

called, she a ns were d t he  phone , I  we nt over t her

told her my  tale of

 Many of us felt as the Bri

 of some of t hese event s and act

 notice of the fact that they

 LaFollette said that, on

that the ai m of the trials wa s to punish the pr

killing, to punish the de

 were doing was killin

there was a lot of truth 
in that. In fa ct, we  ha

may be as fr ank as 
Bill, I think that 
what we were lacking was t

is in retrospect. I think if 
we  ha d ha d s o me good homici de  
lawyers over t her

have made a more telling case. 
As it was, we did 
have some trial lawy
ers who came with 
good reputat ions for advocacy, 
who left , because t hese were
 people, no matt er how 
primitive our technical equipmen
t, these were people who we
re used to pushing a button 
and s u mmoning a sta ff who woul d i m me diate l y

ma king car bon copies , 25 of e ver y si ngle  thi ng

so we had tri al la wyers  who just  woul d not  sta y

WZ :  I think, and th
is is all in retrospect, 
on the political side, I hadn'
t any idea how the judges 
wer e s elect e d t o si t on pa rticular  ca ses . I  know 
generally that the way the 
j u dges wer e selected here 
in t he United St ates.  The chief 
judge of the United States Su
pre me  Court r e fuse d t o le t a ny 
Supre me  Court j udges  c o me  over , he
 refused to let any District Cour
t  judge s  to come  ove r, s o t hat  
you re ally got a pot pourri  of people
 from vari ous st ates of the  c ountr
y. However , j ust  as  cauti ous  a s 
we  were  in  t he sele
c tion of t he pr osec ution s t a f
f for I. G. Farbe
n, for  exa mple, and I  thi n k basic ally 
for better or worse, we fe
lt that the best people we
 were getting wo uld go to
 I. G. Farben and the 
other industrialist cases, if those 
la wy ers wa nte d t o wo rk
 those  cas es you se e.
 There  should ha ve  
bee n s o me  te chni que for e valuating which j udges  were
 better prepared to serv
e on an I. G. Far ben 
case, for example. Paul  Hebert  
belonged there, Morris of North 
Da kot a, obvi ousl y didn't belong 
there  and you know, I 'm spea king 
wit hout knowing a ny of thes e peop
le but  fr om what  I 've hear d. 
That  part of t he process was faul
ty, but if you su
gge sted tha t t o Telfor d Taylor, he woul d possi bly 
say, ﬁ L ook a t  what  we  ha d t o do

de fe nda nt and s o on a nd s o forth.
 And of c our se  it wa s very, ve ry
 Œ t he di ffi culty in t he whole  
oper ation, ha ving s at on t he Supr
eme Court of Ne w York
 for 10 years myself
 and ha ving since my 
retirement spent a good deal of ti
me  l ooking at  the  two 
be cause  nobody wa nts a n
yone of any age to 
go to his grave without having 
sat 500 hours watc hing t he O. 
J. Si mp son case, you know. The 
selecti on of j udges  is part  of the  functi on of an
 administrative judge, who 
ought  to know his pe ople  
and their bac kgr ounds  a n d t heir pre d
ilections sufficiently to
 assign them sensibly
 t o c ase s. This was 
beyond comprehension in Nu remb er
g a nd pr obably beyond ha ving 
being a ble t o work out . But I  
don't  know wh at kind of curriculum
 vitae Telford Ta ylor 
had wit h re spect to e
ach of t h e 33 j udges 
who ca me  over, but i t  woul d s ee m to me t hat  
s o mebody ma de these  a ssi
gnments and I can only 
assume  t hat  t hey were  ma de on a  helt e
r-skelt er basi s, whic h wa s  unfort unate. 
 
06: 21: 54 

 
BZ:  That 's  tr ue, t hey were  pi c ked on t he  basis 
of thei r vol unte ering to go
. Now,  that didn't mean 
that we didn't ha ve  some  very 
good j u dge s. Out  of our  per sonal  knowl edge , I  thi nk tha t  we 
coul d na me  t he m. And when I 
say good judge , I  don't me an th
at they shoul d have bee n 
give n t he  lit mus t est  for  whethe
r t hey were  for  the  pr osec uti o
n or a gai nst  the pr ose cuti o n. I 
think, though, that
 they did re qui re a degr
ee of sophist icati on. I f
eel  they shoul d have ha d 
bac kgr ound on the  whole  Ger ma n ges t alt, the  
whol e Ger ma n busines s. I f not hing el se, t h e 
rise of Hitl er , what he di d, wh
o he was, how he suc
ceeded in taking over
 an entire continent 
and how he al most  succeed
e d i n ta king over  the r e st of t he wor ld.

what their backgrounds were.

Q:   What was l o cal reacti on 
t o t he tr ials , from your per
cepti ons , bei ng over t her e ? 
BZ:  That 's  a  har d  one for me.  

WZ:  It 's  a forgetta ble part  of hi
story. When we  ma ke t he  tur n i nto
 the twenty-first century and all 
the remaining people in their ni
neties and so forth an
d the children of thes

survivors also go deep 
into Social Secur

will have very much more 
signi fica nce  than the Ci vi l War , whic
h wi ll be t hat  much ol der  a gain, i n
 t er m s of ce nt urie s. It 's  going 
to be for gott en. But  the histor y is  t her e.

d t he y know what  the y ha ve t a ken out 
or t h ey'll  be a ble  to fi nd out what 
they have taken out in terms of in

t  l ook at  a not her reas on t hat I  wa s not  ea ger to

 from the work that  Belle was

I cannot escape fr om the 
politics of the situation a
nd the difficulty of deciding
 to take these indicted 
war criminals out of 
Bosnia and deliver them to 
the Hague if you are in e
ffect t he United States of 
America. Because the mo
st significant thing po
litically about th

Q:  But  wh at I  was tr yin g t o a s
k you was, at the ti me
 of the trials, was th
ere a local reaction? 
WZ :   I n  Ger ma n y?  

Q:  Cor rect . 

WZ :  Ger ma n y wa s s o Œ what I  sa
w of it, Nuremb erg, Fr ankfurt,
 wa s so ba dly tor n  up a nd 
devastat ed that the Ger mans wanted 
t o  have a bed t o sl eep
 in and t hey wanted 
t o have a place t o eat  
in and they wanted to ha
ve some food on the tabl
e and this was beyond th
eir enmities. The enmities 
by and l arge evaporat ed wit h t he 
end of t he war. They had to su
rvi ve; the  proble m wa s survi val . 
And not  onl y did we not  inter fer e wit h t heir sur v
ival, with the Marshall Pl
an and mo ney that we  
pumped into Germany and the othe
r devastated countries and Japan,
 we rebuilt thei
r factories and 
put  the m on their feet , you s ee. 

BZ:  They were hostile, 
they were hostile to th
e trials, naturally. That's
 a generalization, but 
neither Bill nor I are any 
tests of public opinion be
caus e we  si mply di dn't d

have read accounts by Re

dust of Nu remb erg. But th
ere  was  a t e nsion, a  ve ry i mporta n
t tension that wa
s cr eate d by the  
shift in our policy towards the 
Soviet  Re public . I n 
the fall of 1946, be fo
re the trial even 
began, our  Secretar y of

59
 had ma de  a spe e ch at Stut tga r t, i n which he 
indic ated t ha t  it wa s ﬁ obvious  to s o me  pe opl eﬂ,

 we were going to 
end up with a conflict with Ru ssia Œ in a c
onflict with Russia,ﬂ and 
he  inti mat ed t hat  we 
would c ertai nly ne ed the  Ger ma ns  on our  side. 
We ll, as Bill once char
acterized it, here was 
the United States Government, s
itting with this wet baby on 
its lap, that baby being the 
Nuremberg trials. So we on the 
pr os e cution ne ver  kne w from da

it was in Texas, 
and this entire country held
 its breath until that chil

Q:  On these sl ave l abor char ges, wasn't t here

BZ:  Oh, yes, well, 
that was the defense through
out, as Bill expl
ained. Either th
at they were

tri otic Ger ma n when hi s c o unt

always  the defens e of superior  or ders  and ma ny 
of the de fe ndants who we

 better to have the SS guar

 that. So that,

an important contribution to

of Hebert's dissen

 indicated that some of ou

BZ:  May I say one more 
thing? In fairness, I 
must say that despite 
the Cold War politics and 
despite the fact that it a 
gave  the  pr os e cution, the various pros
e c utions  ul cer s, t he  War  Depart me nt  
held fa st until the last tr
ial was over and I think that  the war de
partment deserves al
l the credit in the 
world for  tha t . We  wer e s o s ure  
that t h ey we re goi ng t o pull  the 
rug out fr om under us. There wa s 
never t he sli ghte st i ndi ca tion from th
at quarter that they we
re going t o do anythi
ng to di mi nis h t heir  
support of the trials.

He 's  de ad now, but  we bec a me  frie

BZ:  Let's not get in

Q:  But  what I ' m as king i s your

and what affected the hearings. 

WZ:  The y did t he  be st

B Z:  Joe  Du Boi s  wa s a  v e ry  fi ne
 admi nistr ator i n the  Tr easur y Depa rt me nt . He  was a n assi sta nt 

Ge neral Counsel, he esta
blished the Wa r Re fugee Board, wh ichŠ
and admi nister ed 
it.  And he  ha d 
several, to use a common 
word, he ha d se veral  tic ke ts s o far a s
 administration wa
s concerned. And 
it was necessary Œ t he reason I re
commended that  he be br ought ov
er was because I fel t that t he 
prosecution, in preparing the case,
 was a headless horseman, with 
people going off on their own 
advent ures  s o t o s pea k. I ' m not ta lki n g a bout 
blac k mar ket eeri ng, non-cas e  adve nture s, but  wher e 
the case was concerned they were 
goi ng, the y were ma king t he  deci
sion as  to what wa s i m porta nt 
and what to do. Amchen ha

he had als o worke d for  the  gover n me nt  during t he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0382

war . He  had bee n a  trial  l awyer  and we cert ainl y
 needed some one who had 
a gr eat deal of tri al 
experience. Drexel  Sprecher had be
en there fr om the beginning of th
e  IM T t o t he ver y e n d a ft er all 
the trials were concluded. 
He still stayed to edit an
d publish these sets of bo
oks that you're aware of, 
so t hat  he  br ought  to the  pros ecu
tion of I. G. Farben extraordinar
y knowl e dge  of both proc edure and 
a feeling for individu
al responsibility. 
He was always very grateful to 
Bill fo r pointing
 out that we 
had to Œ that it was all very well
 a nd good t o l u mp all these  me n 
int o one  cat egor y under  the t he ory 
of c onspir ac y, but t hat it wa s nece ssar y t o poi nt ou
t wher e t hey sat i n t he  or ganizati on, what t heir  
influence was, what
 their domain was and what 
their peculiar 
liability was. 
 
07: 23: 56 

 

Q:  What  about  t he l
eadershi p of Taylor? 
BZ:  We ll, Tayl or  was  ver y good.
 He  di d, he c oul d not  c ope  w
ith the mechanical
 proble ms  a n y 
more t han anyone else
 could. His deputy was Tom 
Er bin, who r eally wor ked ver y har d t o  get  sta ff, 
to get bodie s , t o get ma chinery th
at worked, t hat  di dn't
 brea k down, t o adj udi cate t he  i mpasse s t hat 
occ urred bet wee n rival  te a ms for mi meogr aphs an
d duplicating machines, 
such as they wer e, 
antiquated as they were. Pa
rdon me , they we re Œ it 
wa s a  tough job, not  to me
ntion the fa ct that they 
wer e deali ng wi th, not  all , but  se
veral  pri ma donna s a mong t he pros ecu
tors. So it was, 
I'm sure that 
in my lifetime I've 
seen better administrations, bu
t I don't think that Telford'
s gr eat  fort e wa s t hat of 
admini strat o r, nor  indee d  was  Tom 
Er bin™s . He wa s a n e xcel lent admi
nist rat or i n private life, but t he 
difficulties were, a lo
t of them were ju
st insurmountable. 
Q:  What  about  moral leader ship?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0382  
64 
 
BZ:  Oh, I think there was extrao
rdinary moral leadership. I think 
that the morale
, up until this 
Col d War  busines s, I t hi n k t hat Ta ylor  could inspir
e gr eat de dic ation, har d work and he  c oul d ral l y 
people to the cause, without 
a ny quest i on. Tayl or 's proble m was  that  he wa s Œ most pe opl e 
considered hi m rat her col
d. And he was, Tayl or was a  sc holar, he
 wa sn™t a hale fellow, well met. He  
had his circle of friends,
 he was not a good politician,
 in other words. On the 
other hand, if you went 
to hi m wit h a pr obl e m or  i f you we nt to hi m a n
d just said, as I did, 
ﬁ This i s one  monume ntal 
SNAFU a nd I ha ve  instructions t o l ea ve wheneve r
 I don't  feel  my s ervi ces  are being pr operly 
utilized,ﬂ he could be very unde
rstanding, indeed, warm. And I ha
ve letters, which are extremely 
warm, which he was not oblig
e d t o wr i t e at  all , but  also it shoul
d be not ed that he
 wa s one of the 
mo st eloquent me n, both in writing
 a n d i n s pee ch, t hat I  have  e v er 
met . I  mea n e ver yone t alks  about  
Jackson's el oque nce , parti cularl y i n his  openi ng a n
d closing statements which 
are really, I think will 
go down i n histor y wit h t he Ge ttys bur g a ddr ess , t h ey
 we re t hat  touc hing and power ful . I t hink t hat 
Telford was equally eloquent.

WZ :  Telford had an absolutely 
monumental administrative job, be
cause although all of us who 
wer e t here, wer e t here because we were i nterested

all of us, aft e r all the

 as how we e vent uall y got  the

that we will one day see

 the case in Bosnia

, these war s, int e rnal as they ma
y be , whi ch are dire ct ed agai nst  
one religious or raci

That's about all 
I ha ve  to say. 
Q:  No w I a m go ing  to

the Nuremberg principles

BZ:  I think it was a ve

think I was not prepar

e motionall y. Not  mat ure  e nough t o
 handle t his  c onst ant ass ault  on

my  husband has 
told me several time
s that it was a great,
 one  of the greate st cha p ters 
i n t he  lives of e ver ybody who 
was at  Nur e mberg and years 
ago, not recently, not in 
many yea rs, but  years  ago I use d to sa y t hat it 
was an exper ience that 
one di d not  have to have , be caus e it
 was pretty shatte

However , he  may be ri ght and I  
ma y be wrong. It  c ertainl y has  had a n i mpa ct on my l i fe .

Q:  IŠact uall y, why don™t  
you talk to me 
about  the i m pact  it™s  ha d on you?  
WZ:  Thi s wa s a n i mport ant  event i n t he  hi s t ory 
of the t we ntiet h c entury. M y li fe , bet wee n 1915 
and wherever it goes from 1996, wa
s encapsulated i n t he t wentieth 
centur y. There we
re two wars. I 
remember as a small boy, being 
taken to a parade, watching th
e AEF, the Amer
ican Expedition 
Force, march back in 1919,
 up Fift h Avenue. I was 
sensitive to that 
war. Wh en I was 
four years old 
I wore a soldier™s suit , wh
ich was modeled on the so

One. I li ve d t hrough t he Twe nties  
and t he exaggerat ed r esponses to
 the first Wo rld Wa r. I lived 
throug h,  as a student and as an ad

be en ver y well  a war e  
of every camp aign for 
the presidency since Al  Sm
ith ran against  Her bert  Hoov
er  in 1928. This  his t or
y is  part  of my li fe , 
the hist ory of the  e ntire  c entur y and t h e Nur e mber g part
 of it  is  one  that i s te rribly i mport ant bec aus e 
I par ticipate d i n it , t o t he  ext ent  of which I  partic
i p ated in the pr esidency 
of Jack Kennedy, in the 
political life of Bobby Ke
nnedy and an awareness of
 Harry Truman, 
in trying to achieve a better 
society through politics, in wh
ich I was heavily engaged and 
so was Belle engaged. And a 
realizati on now, at t his age, abou
t the beauty and the value of the li
fe of a small child. Nuremb erg is 
connect ed with al l of t hat . I  see 
t hose childr en in t he co

wea ring t hei r clot he s, I know how 
I want a c hild t o  look like  a n d t h
ese  things all  fit a patt ern you 
know. I have  no ill usi ons  about my
 contribution to this society, 
but  I don't  downgrade or  de me an 
any of Œ it's had great, gr
eat plea sure s , it 's ha d ver y di ffic ult 
pe riods  a nd per iods  of pain and they, 
they're part of most an
ybody's life, including at
 t hat  present  ti me, when
 t he  pe ople  dear to you, 
either  dying or very cl os

 Nuremb erg wa s a thing that
 I 'll  look bac k upon 
wit h a gr eat  deal  of pl easure and I  
have no comp lica

 I wish I could believe, 
because I know the 
importance of politics in 
everything that goes on 
on this  ea rth, I wis h I c oul d belie ve t ha t  those  pe

 going to do it. But I th
ink it's, I see all of the 
difficulties and all of the compli

 of us would have
