PETER BLACK 
 October 27, 1995 
 
Question: Good morning, Peter. 
Answer: Good morning, Joan. 

Q: Nice to have you here. 

A: It™s great to be here. 

Q: Peter, can you just tell me  what
 your name  was at birth, was it -- 
A: It was Peter -- Peter Bl
ack, has been all my life. 
Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts -- 

Q: Of course. 

A: -- and grew up in the suburbs of Boston. 

Q: And wha t  -- what month and year were you born? 
A: December 29
th
, 1950. 
Q: And tell me  just a little bit about your -- 
your fa mily background, and your childhood, just a 
bit. 

A: I grew up in a Boston Jewish family, non-Je
wish, no temple, as my son will say now. And I 
stayed in Boston til I was 17 and went to the Un
iversity of Wisconsin 
for undergraduate school, 
finished my graduate studies at Columbia Univ
ersity. I was certainly 
satisfied growing up in 
Boston, but anxious to get awa
y, as any teenager mi ght be. 
Q: And were you always interested in history? 

A: Yes. I did actually begin w
ith a -- after the traditional 
dinosaub session as a young child. 
Q: What™s dinosaub? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

A: Dinosaub session. As in dinosaurs, 
those beasts that
 rock the -- 
Q: Aha, dinosaurs, I see, it™s your Boston accent. 
A: Yeah, rock the earth -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- millions of years before. I went through a 
Civil Wa r interest period, and about the time of 
the appearance of William Shirer™s book, ﬁThe Ri
se and Fall of the Thir
d Reich,ﬂ I began to 
become interested in the military history of World War 
11
, and that matured into an interest  in the 
political history of the second World War, a
nd the Nazi regime  by my high school years. 
Q: And whe n you went to University of
 Wi sconsin, was George Masse there? 
A: George Masse was there, my decision to go to Wi
sconsin was dictated in part by the desire to 
get away, and in part by the stre
ngth of the history departme nt there. And I worked with a 
scholar on the Nazi regime , and pa
rticular ly, the particular  interest  in the SS, Robert Kale. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Who had been teaching at Wi sconsin until very recently -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- he retired just 
a couple of years ago. 
Q: So did you t -- also take any courses with George Masse? 

A: I didn™t take any courses with George Masse a
nd that was because I decided to take a junior  
year abroad and took mo st of my German histor
y courses in Germany at the University of Bohn. 

By the time I came back and was eligible for 
the upperclassman courses for -- that Mosse and 
Ha mmereau, who was also another ma jor scholar at
 the University of Wisconsin, were teaching, 
I had already run out of my requireme nts, and 
had to take other than history courses or non-
European history courses to complete the degree.

Q: Did you ever sneak in 
and watch him lecture? 
A: Yes, on occasion, on occasion. 
Q: And wha t  did you think? 

A: I thought he was great. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He was a wonderful lecturer a
nd I certainly used his source ma te
rial at the time . At  that time 
he was perhaps most fa mous for his book, ﬁThe Crisis of German Ideology,ﬂ which came  out in 

the mi d-60™s. 

Q: Right. 

A: And this book was in part instru
mental in educating me  as to th
e root of the na
t -- roots of the 
Nazi ideology, that is 
the intellectual roots 
of the Nazi ideology. 
Q: Mm-hm. So when you went to Columbia, why w 
-- why the choice to Columbia, not to stay at 
Wi sconsin, do you think? 
A: I had wanted to stay at Wi
sconsin, but at the time my prof
essor, Professor Kale wa s going 
through a difficult personal time , an
d he -- as it turned out wisely 
for me , said that he was not 
going to take on any new students at this time and 
advised that -- advised 
strongly that I should 
go to Columbia. At Columbia I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east 
European scholar, but had excellent contacts in the for mer count
ries of the hap -- the former 
countries that ma de up the old Hapsburg monarchy. And between the Columbia University name  

and Dayak™s contacts, it eventually opened up 
some  doors in central and eastern Europe that 
mi ght not have been opened had I stayed at Wi sconsin. 

Q: And how did you continue your work at Colu
mbia?  What was your ma jor -- this -- this -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

A: I came to Columbia with the idea of majoring
 in central and east European hist ory. There was 
more financial aid available for east European hi
story. This was the earl
y 70™s, in the time of 
détente, and it was very -- very important that
 young people study the history of this region, in 
fact there were national defense scholarships 
for study of east European languages and I obtained 
one for studying Roma nian. But primarily I went
 with the idea of st
udying German policy in 
Austria and in eastern Europe and that became my field of concentration. 
Q: Let me  go back a little bit. Wa s there any 
-- besides the inte
llectual connection, and -- and the 
interest starting from Shirer™s
 book, was there a personal connecti
on in your fa mily to World 
War  
11
 and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you, or -- 
A: No, no, this was -- this was purely comi ng 
at it through history, a
nd -- and frankly through 
military history. My fa mily had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad 

fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist 
draft notices, and fled to
 the New World at the 
beginning of this century. So with rare excepti ons, particularly some  cousins in Roma nia, who 
ma naged to survive the war in Romania, most of 
the fa mily was over in the United St ates before 
World War 
1
. 
Q: Oh, I see. So when -- you graduated Columbi a  when?  [indecipherable] 
A: I got the PhD in 1981. 

Q: 1981. And you decided not to teach, or -- si -- 
wa -- I had [i ndecipherable] you mo ved into -- 
A: We ll that -- that -- that wasn™t my decision 
exactly. The 70™s was a very difficult time for new 
graduates comi ng out and obtaini ng teaching jobs. 
I had had a couple of the -- they call them 
thousand dollar courses now, at th
at time I think they were 5
00 dollar courses. I™d taught a 
course on early modern European history, and I 
was scheduled to teach a course on World Wa r 
11
 
and on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was cal
led by a representative of the U.S. attorney™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

office in New York, and asked whether I would be 
interested in working for a short term period, 
gathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offe
nder. In this particular  case it was a Latvian 
auxiliary policeman na med Boleslaus Maikovski
s, who -- whose case had been publicized on 
ﬁ60 Minutesﬂ some  six months earlier, in the sp
ring of 1978. So I was not only aware of the case, 
I was also -- I was also interest
ed in the work, and s
hould -- little anecdote th
at goes with that 
call, at the time I received the call, I was work
ing in a fairly dead end job putting da ta onto 
computer sheets on the other side of the justi
ce departme nt™s suit against the telephone company 
at that time , the AT & T, which was the tele
phone company at that time. And it was a pretty 
dead-end job and I was home  sic
k, suffering from a kidney stone, 
and about ready to go to the 
hospital when the call came  in. And I  had been f
eeling very sorry for mys e lf, and thinking idly 
that it was too bad that I was too young to have 
been around at the time of the Nuremb erg Trials. 
So it was almost like a stroke of a 
-- a divine stroke th
at that call came in at that  time, and when 
asked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me  pass the kidney stone, 
I™ll be right in for an interview. 
Q: Le -- let me  ask you a question 
a bit about graduate school, just
 t -- t-to know what the texture 
was at the -- at the time. Were th
ere a lot of people studying World Wa r 
11
, and the Nazis and the 
-- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi
 regime , or were you an oddity at the time at 
Columbia? I mean, what 
-- what was it like?   
A: Columbia didn™t have at th
at time, a specific World Wa r 
11
 scholar. It did have a strong 
eastern European departme nt, but 
its modern -- its eastern European
 modernist, Voytek Mastney, 
who was my  professor my first year at Columbia 
didn™t get tenure and had to
 leave at the end of 
1972 - 1973. He went on to post-war studies in
 Co mmunis m. And that was the focus at 
Columbia University, but that  doesn™t  mean that
 there weren™t -- there wasn™t a generation of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
6 
 
scholars, not studying the Holocaust 
per se, because that was still very much a political term, and 
not the term of [indecipherable] for this period as
 yet, certainly not in academic parlance. But 
there were a group of scholars who had been spaw
ned and encouraged by the availability of 
captured German records on mi crofilm at the national archives. They were first available in an 
easy to use format on the mi crofilm in the early 1
960™s. And this was also the time  in which the 
originals, which had been captured by the U.S. ar
my, were returned to the Federal Republic of 
Germany in the mi d-60™s, according to treaty. And 
we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that 
generation of young scholars who were interested 
in the Nazi regime , and interested in the 
organizations of the Nazi regime , and also fascin
ated with the personnel f
iles of the individuals, 
fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate --  
what ma de these people tick, and how did they 
operate as individuals and as an
 organization. And that spawned my
 interest in the SS, and my 
interest in doing a biography. 

Q: Was -- was Hillberg™s work import
ant to you at that time , or not? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: It was. 

A: Hillberg™s work came  out in 1961 -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and he was one of the earliest part of that 
generation. Hillberg had actually worked with the 
captured German records, analyzed as a documen
t analyst in the late 40™s and early 50™s, and 
wrote his book based on that documentation befo
re it was mi crofilmed, and you can tell that 
from the citations in his book, he still has the or
iginal file folder numbers there. And his book 
first came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to
 get serious when I started college in ™68, a 
paperback version was out, and easily avai
lable even to a poor graduate student.

Q: Right, right, that Bibl
e -- that Bible-looking -- 
A: Yes, it was a Bible even then. 
Q: Right, yes. All right, so you get the cal
l, and you obviously passed your kidney stone. 
A: I did, not without 
difficulty, but I did. 
Q: Right. So then what happe
ned?  What™s the next -- what
™s the next step?  Your -- 
A: Well basically I went in to the U.S. attorney™s
 office in the southern di
strict of New York in 
south Manhattan, was interviewed by
 an attorney there, and he ga
ve me the information a -- his 
name was Tom Balout, was a la
wyer from Connecticut who™s 
long since gone into private 
practice. And he told me  a little bit about the Maikovskis case, and about the problems with the 

Maikovskis case, and he explaine
d to me that the me mbers of 
the special litig
ation unit in 
Washington, D.C., which had been formed the year
 earlier, 1977, and which had recently, in the 
spring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approxima tely
 four lawyers, two paralegals and one part-
time historian, needed some one w
ho was based in New York, who 
could conduct research in the 
archives in New York, the ma in one of which 
was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research, 
which at that time was located on the corner of East 81
st
 Street, and I believe it was Fifth 
Avenue. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they had been canvassing a-around in Wa sh
ington for contacts, and 
one of the attorneys 
at the time, George Parker, had talked to my 
first advisor at Columbia, Voytek Mastney, who 

was on a stint with Johns Hopkins at the time
. And Mastney recom -- recommended me  as a 
possibility, that™s how they got 
my name . And I came in, and -- 

Q: So did you go down to Wa shington to talk with these folks, or did you s -- 

A: No, I was hired from New York.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
8 
 
Q: From Ne w York, so -- okay. 
A: And I was based in the New York office from
 -- from my start date in September ™78, until 
shortly after the office was moved from the immi gr
ation service, was calle
d the special litigation 
unit, under the Immi gration and Naturalization Service, and it was moved into the criminal 

division in May, 1979. Six months af
ter that I had already requested
 a transfer, and I requested 
also to be able to work pa -- full time. And th
ey were interested in me , and they brought me  

down on January first, 1980. 

Q: And by that time  Rya n, Alan Ryan wa
s -- was -- was OSI formed at that point? 
A: OSI was for -- 

Q: Wa s taken out of -- 

A: -- OSI was formed in May 1979, and -- under atemporary director, Walter Rockler, who had 

been a Nuremberg prosecutor. I believe -- I™m not
 sure, I believe he was a prosecutor in the 
Deutshe Bank case at Nuremberg. And he was brought
 in by the criminal division to reorganize 
the special litigation unit, expand its st aff, a
nd deploy it effectively as
 a central agency to 
investigate and if necessa ry litig
ate all of the Nazi  offender cases in the United States. Rockler 
was the director from Se ptember -- I™m sorr
y, he was the director from M a y 1979 until 
approxima tely March 1980. I believe it was a nine 
month detail, or a 10 month detail. And Ryan 
was brought on as the deputy some time in -- he was there when I moved down to Washington, so 

it must have been sometime in 1979. And then he -- he came -- Ryan came  from the solicitor 

general™s office in the Departme
nt of Justice, and he took ove
r as director when Rockler 
withdrew and went back to 
private practice in March 1980.

Q: Right. So tell me  a little bit about this fi
rst case that you di d in New York. What -- what -- 
what were they asking you to do?  They were asking you to go to the archives and find -- can you 

talk about that? 

A: Well, they didn™t -- they di
dn't really know what to ask me  to do. They asked me  to find 
evidence about this case, and I wasn™t quite sure 
what they wanted me  to do either, so I did -- 
what I did know how to do was go to then -- go 
to the published records,
 the Nuremb erg trial 
records, and put together, I think it wa s about 
a 10 or a 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian 
auxiliary police in -- in -- unde
r German occupation in 1941. Maikovskis was accused of having 

been a precinct chief in an eastern region of
 Latvia, around Rezekne, Rossitten in German. And 
he had been accused of pa rticipa
ting in killings of local Jews in the summe r  and autumn of 1941. 
And I went to some  of the basic sources, 
there™s a lengthy Nuremberg document whi c h was 
written by the commander of the security police, in SD in the Baltic St ates, the former 

Einsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, wh
ich was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages 
dealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police, in 

particular the auxiliary police. We  also had in 
New York, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports, 
which were on mi crofilm at the ti
me, and I reviewed those and gathered the ma terial that were 
relevant to La tvian auxiliary police killings of Je
ws  and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941, 
and I put it together in a basic hi
storical essay that I would write 
as a college paper at that time . 
This was before I had the PhD., and in fact 
it was at the time when 
I was writing the PhD.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, 
and particularly by the speed in which it was 
gathered. It wasn™t such a big 
thing to a historian, but it wasobviously some thing that was very 
helpful to the attorney. And the reason for that wa
s that the case had run in
to a snag. The original 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
10 
 
allegations had come  from witnesses, primarily
 Israeli witnesses, w
ho had Maikovskis little -- 
literally in every location in 
Latvia, killing people. And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to 
Latvia to take depositions of for mer Soviet --
 Soviet Latvian citizens 
who had been Maikovskis™s 
comr ades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one
 area of Latvia, in southeastern Latvia by 
Rezekne. And the judge in the case was extremel
y hostile to the idea 
of deporting some one for 
Nazi offenses. Not -- and th-th-there™s no reason to 
believe that  he was sympathetic to the Nazis, 
he just didn™t like the idea of throwing some one 
out of the United States on the basis of old 
evidence and evidence that had came in part fr
om the Soviet Union. And the judges hostility 
ma de it diffi cult for the attorneys to use the witn
ess evidence, which, as it turned out, wa s a good 
thing for the Maikovskis case because the governme
nt eventually withdrew the charges against 

Maikovskis in the complaint, in 
-- in the order to show cause, Ma
ikovskis was a alien, he wasn™t 
a citizen. The -- the charges that placed Ma
ikovskis anywhere outside  of Rezekne were 
withdrawn, and the case then 
focused solely on what was going on in Rezekne. And with a 
combination of documents in U.S. archives, whic
h gave the general picture of what was going on 
in the Soviet -- in -- in
 -- in German occupied Latvia, in 
that region, and the statements, the 
depositions, complete with cross 
examination of Soviet witnesses 
-- that is Soviet citizens who 
had been comr ades of M a ikovskis, who described 
from their eyewitness point of view what had 
happened, enabled us to secure 
Maikovskis™s order of deportation. 
If I remember correctly, we 
lost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule agai
nst us, but we won on a
ppeal, at the board of 
immi gration appeals. And Maikovskis eventually 
fled to We st Germany before he was actually 
deported.  
Q: Deported, I see. We  -- do you know if he was 
ever tried in Germany?
 Or did he si -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
11 
 
A: Th-The German -- the -- the Germans investig
ated Maikovskis, and here -- I™m not sure, I 
think they actually -- I™m not sure if they in
di cted him, but he was placed under investigation, 
and the investigation was still 
ongoing when he died. He was an older ma n, I think he was born 
in 1909, if I reme mber correctly. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did you go to the hearing 
on the -- in this particular -- 
A: The U.S. -- the U.S. hearing, yes -- 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- I was pr esent at the hearing, which was -- to
ok place in -- in New York in -- I -- it was 
either the summer of ™8
1 or the summer of ™82. 
Q: W- When you first got involved in this, had -- 
di-did you know about the legal basis on which 
all of these cases were go
ing to be tried, and -- 
A: I knew nothing more because I -- I™m -- I was not
 a great ne wspaper reader at  the time , and I 
knew nothing more than what I had heard on th
e ﬁ60 Minutesﬂ program. I don™t reme mber what I 
heard on the ﬁ60 Minutesﬂ program, but I suspect it 
probably wasn™t too er
udite about the legal 
rami fications. I learned most of wha t
 I learned about th
e law on the job. 
Q: So te -- tell me what -- what the tri --  the tria
ls, or the ability to -- I 
don™t -- do one -- does one 
call it an indi ctment, or --  

A: No. 

Q: -- bringing a case. 

A: No, no. 

Q: It™s not a criminal procedure? 

A: I used the word indictment for the German
 case because  it was a criminal proceeding -- 
Q: Criminal pro -- right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
12 
 
A: -- in -- in Germany, but the proceedings in th
e United States are all ci
vil cases, and there -- 
they™re of two types. There™s a 
denaturalization, if the indivi dual is a U.S. citizen, there™s a 
denaturalization process, and -- a
nd the equivalent of the indictme nt is called a complaint. The 
governme nt ma kes a complaint, and the governme nt 
is the plaintiff, and the defendant is the 
person agai nst whom the -- in this case the Na
zi offender. If the i
ndividual is a -- just a 
permanent resident, is -- is an
 alien, then it™s -- it™s an or
der to show cause
 for deportation. 
Q: Right. 

A: The complaint is fi led in the U.S. District 
Court, because the U.S. District Court has the 
authority to confer and revoke citizenship. And 
the -- the order to show cause is filed in 
immi gration court, because it 
becomes a immi gration and na
turaliz -- I-Immigration and 
Naturalization Service ma
tter for non-citizens.  
Q: So that™s why these are separate, be  -- becau
se the jurisdiction over th
is particular kind of 
process -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- is in one place, and the 
other is in the other pl ace. 
A: Yes, absolutely. And -- and there -- a --a citi
zen has different rights 
than an alien, obviously. 
And there™s a procedur e -- i-in te
rms of a citizen, we -- we, that is the OSI had to go through a 
process of denaturalization, and then the whole 
set of appeals and then deportation. After the 
denaturalization, appeals had been exhausted. If 
a person had been denaturalized, and the appeals 
were exhausted, and those appeals could go all 
the way up to the Supreme Court, then the 
process woul d start again, because the person wa s now an alien. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
13 
 
A: The process would start again 
in immigration court, and go th
rough that series of appeals, 
which could again go up to the Supreme Cour
t before some one was actually deported or 
removed from the country. 
Q: The -- this particular process, to not have 
it be a criminal prosecution, is this because of 
something in international law, or was this a de
cision the United States governme nt ma de, not to 
make this a criminal proceeding, but rather to ta
lk about willful mi srepresentation, that some one 

mi srepresented who they were, and we wouldn™t ha
ve let them into the country before. Why not 
try these people for what they actually did?  

A: I think there were a lot of 
factors involved in that. One clea
rly was, unlike the -- the Great 
Britain, which decided to go the criminal route, 
the Australians and the 
brit -- and the Canadians 
also decided, with total lack of success, to go th
e criminal proceedings rout e. The United States 
had a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a 
cr iminal juri sdiction for trying these cases in the 
United States, under criminal procedures would 
-- was, as I understand it
, possible, but would 
have involved considerable difficulty, and considerab
le delay in setting up the apparatus. It also 
would have held the government to an extremely 
strict standard, as it did in the cases of 
Australia, Great Britain and Ca
nada, of proving potentially, an 
individual case of mu rder. The -- 
on the other hand, the immi gration procedures were 
in pl ace, and had been in
 place, particul arly 
since ma ny of the offenders had come  in under 
the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee 

Relief Act of the -- the -- the legi slation that was 
extant in the late 40™s 
and early 50™s. And there 
was legislation on the books already that if th
ese applicants for immi gration, and later for 
naturalization gave willful, false st atements about
 their past , that they coul d be denaturalized, 
and ultima tely deported. They would return to thei
r pre-immi gration status. That is, as an alien, 
which now the truth was known, was ineligible to en
ter the United States. And an ineligible alien 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
14 
 
face -- who is in the United States, faces deporta
tion. U.S. i mmi gration law, some time s  for ma ny 
of the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, a
nd does not ma ke many exceptions. And it was 
evidently decided -- this is not
 first-hand knowledge of -- of mi ne
, it was evidently decided that 
this would be an appropriate pro
cess to deal with the issue of N
azi offenders living in the United 
States. It was hoped, I think initia
lly, that for ma ny of these individuals, that the nations where 
they had committed their offenses, would request 
their extradition. And in fact, there was some  
precedent for that. There was an outstanding re
quest on the part of the former Yugosl a v 
governme nt, for the former Croat Minister of th
e Interior, Andrea Art
ukovich, since the early 
50™s. And in 1972, the West Germa n governme nt 
requested and obtained the extradition of a 
Long Island housewife name d Hermi ne Braunsteine
r-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the 
Lublin Majdanek concentrati
on camp, and who had evaded jus
tice afterwards, married an 
American serviceman, and had come  over to live in
 the United States, and who was sort of the 

epitome  of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan 
tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983. 
Q: So it™s a -- it™s an -- I™m -- yeah. 

A: So there™s some precedent for the idea that the nations on whose soil these indi viduals had 

committed their cr imes, would want these people back in order to try them. And of course, we 

found -- we, that is the United States governme nt, 
found very quickly that most of these nations, 
regardless of whether they made bellicose st atem
ents about dealing with Nazi offe nders, were 
not terribly excited about having 
them back, and this is some thing that we found out quite 
quickly in the Trifa case, where the Ro manians re
ally had no interest in having Valerian at the 
time, Viarel Trifa back to Romania to try him 
for anything. The Soviet Union was often prepared 
to take people back in the 1970™s and 1980™s, but
 the United St ates governme nt was not prepared 
at that time  to send individua
ls back to the Soviet Union.

Q: So this had to be some what frustrating, because th-the results are -- co
uld be seen as kind of 
mi ni ma l. Pe ople could escape to othe
r countries if they were not ex
tradited back to the original 
country to be tried. 
A: Yeah, the opportunity to escape was quite availa
ble to anyone, particular
ly to citizens. There 
was no authority to the uni -- for the United Stat
es governme nt to imprison a citizen of the 

United States during a de naturalization proceedi
ng. The immi gration and naturalization service 
can imprison an individual who is about to be or
dered deported, and of whom it can be surmised 
that he will se -- seek to flee to avoid deporta
tion. The INS can put some one in the slammer for 
that. But the United States governme nt did not ha
ve the authority to imprison an individual who 
faced denaturalization proceedings. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so those individuals could leave, in fact
, with their citizenship, and the worst they faced 
was a in abse ntia de naturalization proceeding. 
Q: So you wa -- you mi ght continue -- 
A: We  woul d continue the proceedings -- 

Q: -- the com -- the -- ce
dure -- procedure, uh-huh. 
A: -- to denaturalize, regardless of whether the 
individual was in the United States, because it 

was our intention that in the cas
es of those who fled, they were
 ineligible to enter the United 
States, and denaturalization would render them, 
now under the Holzma n a mendment, ineligible 
to ever return -- 

Q: To return. 

A: -- to the United Stat es. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
16 
 
Q: Just a -- just as a techni
cal point, if you would do a case lik
e that, would there be a defense 
attorney there, or you would simply 
do your case before the judge with -- 
A: Often there was a defense attorney, yes. 

Q: -- and -- uh-huh. 

A: Often there was a di -- an attorney represen
ting the interests of the defendant, who some ti me s 
still had pr operty in the United Stat es. 

Q: I see, I see. Can you talk a -- a bit about 
how you understand the -- the 
law, starting with the 
Displaced Pe rsons Act, and until you get to actu
ally -- well, when is it, the Holzman amendment 
is in 1980 passing -- 

A: Holzman amendment  is passed, if I™m correct -- 
if I™m correct, it was passed in -- by Congress 
in 1978, and ratified in 1980. So it became effective 
in 1980. It really goes back to United States 
immi gration policy at the end of Wo rld Wa r 
11
. The United States clearly saw that it ha d been 
remi ss -- the United States governme nt at the ti
me, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular 
support, that it had been remi
ss in granting sanctuary to re
fugees prior to World Wa r 
11
, and there 
was a concerted effort to provide special immi gr
ation legislation for refugees after World Wa r 
11
, 
that would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas
 which developed out of the 1924 Immi gration 
and Naturalization Act. And the first of these spec
ial -- fi rst of two -- actually three special  laws, 
was the Displaced Persons Act, which was pa
ssed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the 
last da y of 1952. And it created a separate cat
egory, over and above the quotas, of displaced 
persons who were eligible beyond the quotas to recei
ve visas to immi grate to the United States. 
And if me mory serves me correct, some  
400,000 people -- I think 
just under 400,000 people 
immi grated to the United States under the Di
splaced Persons Act from
 various countries in 
Europe. There were -- the Displaced Persons Act 
also provided for the establishment of a DP 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
17 
 
commission, which operated in Europe and admi ni
stered displaced person™s camps to provide 
sanctuar y for survivor s of the Holocaust, refug
ees from Communist takeovers in eastern Europe, 
and displaced persons uprooted
 by the Nazis during their occ
upation of eastern Europe who 
could -- could not, or would not be
 repatriated, to give them a pl
ace where they could find shelter 
and food, and in the case of kids, find some  
education and training, while they awaited the 
completion of the application pr ocess for a visa
. When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the 
U.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable
 public support, and this was -- keep in mi nd 
this was the time of the McCarthy era, despite 
the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief 
act was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the 

Displaced Pe rsons Act, to come  to the United 
States on special visas 
that went over and beyond 
the numbers and the quotas. And these visas, the 
last big blup of visas, came  in Dece mber 1956, 
and spilled over to January 1957 to accommoda
te the refugees from Hunga ry, from the 
Hungarian revolution of 1956. Now each of these d
ecrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945 
regulation, if I reme mbe r  correctly, 
there were increasingly less strict
 restrictions on eligibility to 
those who were either German, or received some  benefit from the Nazi regime , or had 

collaborated with the Nazi regi me. There was a 
regulation -- a -- a Stat
e Department regulation 

already in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from
 comi ng into the United States. The Displaced 
Persons Act had fairly stringent
 restrictions on Nazi collabor
ators, those who assisted in 
persecution on the basi s of race, religion and nati
onal origin, from entering the United States. 
The Refugee Relief Act also had si milar, ex
cept somewhat vaguer la
nguage, but still had 
language that excluded persons 
who personally participated in
 persecution from entering the 
United States. Now, initially, as an example of ho
w the legislation was re laxed in this aspect is 
the following; under the Displaced Pe rsons Act of 1948, SS me mbership rendered one ineligible 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
18 
 
from entering the United States, regardless of wh
at you had done in the SS -- what -- what an 
individual had done as a me mber
 of the SS. Membership in th
e SS alone, was enough to exclude 
from the United States. In -- unde
r the amendment of 1950, which me
ms - -  me re me mbership in 
the SS was no longer sufficient to exclude. One had t
o, as a me mber of the  SS, have participated 
in persecution. The ame ndment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the Baltic 
States to enter as displaced persons, even if 
they had served in collaborative units, like the 
Latvian legion of the Waffen SS. La tvians coul
d come  before , through the Displaced Pe rsons 
Act, but they can -- could not have been affiliate
d with Nazi organiza tions. Under the DP Act as 
amended, they were now no longer ineligible. 

Q: And why  -- 

A: But their me mbership -- they di d --  
they were required to tell the trut h -- 
Q: About the me mbership. 

A: -- about the me mbership, so as not to cut off an
 avenue of inquiry about 
their activities. So in 
other words it -- it rema ined against the law fo
r a Latvian who had been a me mber of the Wa ffen 

SS to say that he was a bookkeeper during the war,
 when in fact he™d been a me mber of the 

Waffen SS, even if it had -- it
 w -- would later have been found that he had done nothing more 
than been a combat soldier. If he had adm
itted under the DP Act as amended that he was a 
Waffen SS c o mbat soldier, and nothing more could 
be found against him,  then he was eligible to 
enter the United States. But having concealed th
at information, that was already concealing, 
omitting, giving false statement, to obtain a federal benefit, which -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- brought a whole other exclusionary process to bear. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
19 
 
Q: So, before we get to the -- the -- the ne
xt amendment, why do you think they made this 
change? 
A: I-I™m sure there were ma ny f
actors involved. The one that come s 
to mind is that there was a -- 
a shortage of agricultural labor in the United Stat
es, and a lot of the east European refugees from 
Communism were far mers, and farmer™s sons. A
nd the -- and al -- and ma
ny of them were also 
ethnic Germans from eas tern Europe. And I have 
no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to 
individuals who were escaping 
Communist regime s was a signifi
cant factor in amending the 
Displaced Pe rsons Act. There was also a feeling ev
en at the time  that for those who served in 
combat units that were affiliated with NaziGermany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for 

me mbers of the Baltic states, whose annexati
on by the Soviet Union the United States never 
recognized, that these people had ha
d very bad choices, and that th
e one that they chose was only 
marginally less worse than the --  the other that 
wa s available to them. An
d so I think i -- th -- a 
combination of factors led to th
e amendment of the Displaced Pers
ons Act, and also led to the -- 
the slight di fferences in the Refugee Relief Act. 

Q: And so then what is the next
 change that ha ppens?  Is it -- 
A: After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, 
at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immi gration 
and Naturalization Act had been passed, which was 
slightly less rest rictive, and here I™m -- here 
I™m speaking off the top of my h
ead -- slightly less re
strictive than the ‚24 act, but it wa s a quota 
act again. And that came  back into force, a
nd remained in force until 1986 or ™96, the new 
immi gration act -- the new i mmi gration act, I thin
k it was 1996, replaced th
e ™52 act. Under these 
acts, all of these acts, the ™52 ac
t in particular, but also the ot
her special immigration legislation, 
that an individual who was or
dered deported, could apply for 
what was called discretionary 
relief, for a number of reasons, whether they™ve 
been a good citizen, and they were -- when they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
20 
 
-- while they lived in the United St
at es, if their wi -- were married to U.S. citizens, if they had 
children who were U.S. citizens, if they had 
close relatives who were
 dependent on them who 
were U.S. citizens. And another very importa
nt and applicable one 
in these cases, if by 
deportation to the country from whence they 
came, they would be subjected to political 
persecution. And this was a particul arly applicable part of the st
atute for the Communis t  regime s, 
and was applied in the case of the former Croa
t Minister of the Interi
or, Andrea Artukovich who 
came in the -- into the United States under a false 
name , was clearly involved in persecution. He 
came even before the DP act, he came under the1924 act, I believe. And he was actually ordered 
deported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceedi
ng, but the or der of deportation was stayed 

because he was successfully able to argue th
at he  would be persecuted in a Communist 
Yugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial. And th
is very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold 
War atmosphere of the time, and this was an at
mo sphere that continued affecting the few cases 
that actually were prosecuted, or were litigat ed
 during the 50™s and 60™s, until the Viet nam era. 
Q: Uh-huh. And what was the change with the Holzma n Amendment? 

A: The Holzman Amendment, which was passed 
in 1978 radically changed this in that for 
persons who participated in persecution on th
e basis of race, religi
on, national origin and 
political opinion, they added political opinion u
nder Holzman, under the aegis of Nazi Germany 
or its allies, or in territori es occu
pied by Nazi Germany between January 30
th
, 1933, and May 
eighth, 1945, if found to be deportable, if found to 
be ineligible to enter 
the United States, could 
not apply for discretionary relief 
on any basis. And so this there 
-- this therefore opened the door 
for an actual result to these cases, you didn™t ha ve to go through the litigation only to fi nd that  

the indi vidual could appl y for and get discretionary
 relief, either because 
his children were U.S. 
citizens, or  because he could claim political pe
rsecution from a Communist country. Now, did it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
21 
 
mean that we were -- we, the U.S. governme nt we
re willing to deport th
ese people just to any 
country, as a practice?  Not yet, but at least lega
lly the possibility was ther
e to obtain an order of 
deportation and actua
lly carry it out. 
Q: And the Cold Wa r is still going on, so what
 allowed Holzman™s a mendment to actually be 
passed when people still had a very
 -- I don™t know, shall we callit a rigid view, or at least a 
Cold Wa r view of eastern European 
countries under the Soviet Union? 
A: Again, I think it was a combination of factor
s. Clearly important was the precedent of the 
Braunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked qu
estions about how ma ny other Nazi criminals 
were living in our mi dst, so to speak. And that cr
eated a certain degree of public pressure, in part 
from Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were 
immi grants with no -- no confidence to say what 
they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the 
imme diate past as opposed to dea
ling with creating a new life anda future, were now established 
U.S. citizens, quite conscious and aware of their 
rights to lobby congressmen, to get some  results 
on this. A second key factor was the developmen
t of a -- the process of
 détente between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. The year 
that Braunsteiner-Rya
n was extradited, 1972, was 
also the year that President Nixon visited Moscow 
and ushered in the era of
 détente, which lasted 
more or less until the election of Ronald Reagan 
in 1980. This was also a time  at which we in the 
United States, and to a greater degree, prosecu
tors in We st Germany were beginning to see 
glimpses of the types of usable
 evidence, credible evidence that
 existed behind the iron curtain. 
In the 50™s this stuff just was not available in an
y way. In the 60™s, particularly in the early 60™s, 
trickles of docume ntary ma terial captured by th
e Red army, c a me  into the public domain through 
west Germa n trials, and also through Soviet pr
opaganda pamphlets in th
e late 60™s and early 
70™s, denouncing the western powers for harborin
g Nazi crimi nals. Now the pamphlets were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
22 
 
were -- were nonsense, and -- and often ma ny of th
e statements in the pamphlets were nonsense, 
as well as the interpretations. But the documents
 that were photocopied, if genuine, and one 
couldn™t tell if they were genuine
 unless they subjected -- subject
ed them to careful forensic 
testing, were not only interesting in themselves, 
but fascinating as examples of the type of 
ma terial that had survived the war, and that was 
in Soviet hands. One of the key driving forces 
behind the office of special inve
stigation™s success, was an ea
rly agreement in 1980 with the 
Soviet Union to take vi de otaped depositions fr om 
Soviet citizens, all of whom were comr ades of 
the defendants in the United States, and of whom
, while it mi ght be questioned what kinds of 
pressures they were in the Soviet Union, it coul
dn™t be questioned that 
they knew the defendants 
involved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, de
fense attorneys could raise questions as to how 
they could possibly know that this was the ma n 
who did this, that and the other thing. The 
comr ades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who ma y have known them fr om their 

home towns couldn™t be questioned. They -- thei
r knowledge of the defendants as me mbers of 
these units was much more credible, even if it 
wa s comi ng fr om behind the Iron Curtain. We  also 
were unable at that time to get unrestricted access 
to Soviet records, but we were able to get 
access to copies of documentation, at least pertai
ning to our defendants at that time, and in 
response to the general objection of the defense 
that these docume nts were always forged by the 
Soviet Union, the Soviet author
ities quickly understood that in
 order for the United States 
governme nt to be credible, that they would have
 to fork over the originals. And this started 
already in 1980 - 1981, where the S
oviet authorities would have th
e original document sent to 
the Soviet embassy or Soviet consulate, depend
ing on where the trial was taking place, in the 
United States, where the document could then be examined by the governme nt™s forensics 

examiners for handwriting, for paper, for typing qua
lity, for signatures. And also by teams hired 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
23 
 
by the defense. And at no time did the Soviet
s ever repr esent to OSI that a document was 
genuine when it was not genuine. 
Q: Really? 

A: Never. Never. In some  of their pamphlet lite
rature, they would leave things out, but when we 
-- when we in the United States government aske
d where™s the beef, the Soviet Union always 
provided the beef. 

Q: So from all of these laws and amendments, th
e essential question, if I 
have it correctly, when 
you ma ke a complaint, is was there willful mi sr
epresent ation of a person™s past in connection 
with the Nazi  regi me, is that -- 

A: A basic -- 

Q: Is that  -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in general. 
A: That™s a little too general. It
™s not simply willful mi srepresentat
ion. It i -- it™s actually ma terial 
mi srepresentation, and the material
ity must go to the fact that had the information been known, it 
would or mi ght have led to an investigation that
 would or mi ght have unc
overed facts that would 
have re -- rendered the defendant in
eligible. So in other words, th
ere had to be some  basis that 
would render the individu
al ineligible beyond the simple fact of lying. 

Q: Right. 

A: Beyond the simple fact of --  

Q: It wasn™t lying about anythi
ng, it had to be lying about that 
which was ma terially relevant. 
A: Yes. And in the Nazi offender cases, that invo
lved participation and pe
rsecution on the basis 
of race, religion, national origin or  political opini on. Now that -- that -- that™s how the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
24 
 
immi gration statut e read, and that -- the natu -- 
the natural --  denaturalization complaints were 
worded somewhat differently, you ha d to prove th
at a person was of bad 
moral character because 
they ma terially mi srepresented, because they 
illegally procured a visa, having ma terially 
mi srepresented, and that mi srepresentation was ma
terial because it concealed information or data 
that mi ght have led to uncovering this person
™s participation and persecution. So it was a 
participation and persecution that was the -- 
Q: That was central. 

A: -- vital issue. 

Q: So it™s not -- 

A: You never -- 

Q: -- not me mbership? 

A: No. 

Q: So if one is -- was a member of the  Nazi pa
rty, that™s not sufficient.
 If -- if they --  
A: If it™s some thing -- if it was some thing as gene
ral and as amorphous as th
e Nazi party, or even 
the SS, or even a given military unit, yes. But there were some  units whose raison d™etre was 

involved in persecuting people in 
the basis of race, re
ligion, national origin
 and political opinion. 
A -- a -- a example that the Supreme Court ex
amined in the Fe derenko case was that of a 
concentration camp guard. And the Supreme Cour
t ruled that by the ve
ry daily duties of a 
concentration camp guard, even if he did nothi
ng personally against a pr
isoner; never shot a 
prisoner, never beat a prisoner, never so much 
as looked at a prisoner,
 by standing there on the 
perime ter of the camp with a rifle in his hand, he 
is acting as a deterrent 
fra -- for the prisoners 
from escaping, and that this was 
participation in persecu
tion. So there were certain units that if 
you could prove, if we the U.S. governme nt could pr
ove that the individual was a me mber of that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
25 
 
unit, and carried out the normal daily
 routine of that unit, we woul
d -- that -- that person could be 
proven, if we could prove those facts, a judge co
uld ma ke a fi nding that that person participated 
in persecution. Or that that person wa s a -- 
a person of bad moral character because he  
participated in persecution. 
Q: Right. So different from a criminal trial. Ha
d -- had the United States governme nt gone to do 
criminal trials, you would have had to prove 
the actual event of the person doing something, 
whereas within the context of the naturalization 
trial, if you could prove
 the connection with a 
type of action that was common, eve n if you couldn™
t prove this person did it, but if they were 
concentration camp guards, they were part
 of the Waffen SS, 
if they were -- 
A: It -- if it was understood that
 by carrying out his daily duties -- 
Q: He could be. 

A: -- he was doing it.  

Q: Oh. 
A: That -- no, he was doing it. 
Q: He was doing it. 

A: It wasn™t that he could do 
it. A concentration camp guard, by st
anding there with a rifle, is 
assisting-- it -- it™s part
icipation, assistance, advocation and 
acquiescence. Now I -- I don™t think 
we ever were able to deport anyone 
or denaturalize anyone because he -- 
Q: Advocated. 

A: -- or she acquiesced. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Advocation, no, advocation, the Tr ifa case was 
based a lot on advocation of persecution. But 
acquiescence alone usually didn™t 
cut it as a ma tter of discretion on whether to file a case. But in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
26 
 
terms of participation and assist ance, a gar -- a cordon guard at a mass killing, or a camp guard, 
is certainly helping the leadership of that tex --
 mass killing, or the leader ship of that  camp to 

persecute people, and that was assistance in 
persecution. Now had the 
United States gone the 
criminal route, it™s hard to know wha t  would 
have happened, and it™s a 
route not taken, but the 
standard of evidence would have been beyond 
a reasonable doubt, whereas the standard of 
evidence in the civil cases wa
s clear and convincing. Judges often held the United States 
governme nt fairly close to a beyond a reasonable doubt
, but we could ma ke this culpability as a 
reflection of me mbership, or me mbe r ship being cu
lpability, me mbership in an organization that 
did as its daily business the persecution of i
ndividuals on the basis of
 race, religion, national 
origin and political opinion. That 
we could do. It™s conceivable that
 in a criminal case, with the 
way we have conspiracy -- you know, prosecutions
 against conspiracy 
where the -- where the 
driver of the escape vehicle is as mu ch guilty as
 the individual who fire
s the gun of the murder 
that™s committed in the bank, it
™s conceivable we mi ght have 
gone that way, but the standards 
would have been higher, and it ma y well have
 been very difficult to obtain convictions. 
Q: Right. We™re going to have
 to take a break for -- 

A: Shortly. 

Q: -- tape. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
27 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Peter, let™s -- let™s st ar t with 
part of what we ended up with fr
om the last tape and talk about 
what does it mean to talk about acquiescence 
within the context of a complaint, wa -- 
A: Well, the sta --  the Holzman Statute refers to
 four patterns of activit
y related to persecution; 
assistance, participation, or ma ybe participati
on is a better one to start with, assistance, 
advocation, and acquiescence. Acqu
iescence as I understood while I 
was working with OSI, and 
as I think my colleagues on the legal side of it 
understood it, was basica
lly standing by without 
any specific official or unoffi
cial relation to the events, a
nd letting it happen. And to my 
knowledge we never -- we never filed a case based 
on acquiescence alone. It 
was always at least 
some  active participation, assistance or advoca
tion that me t the standard for us to ma ke a 
decisi on to file a complaint or
 an order to show cause. 
Q: So some body who was standing by, wasn™t conn
ected with a -- a unit of some  kind, but was 
watching, common folks. 
A: Yes. 
Q: That would not be considered -- 

A: No, no, we would not have, to best of my 
knowledge we wouldn™t --
 and I certainly would 
have advised against -- as a hi
storian I would have ad-advised
 against on the basis of the 
evidence, filing a case against, for instance,
 a bystander who watched an execution. Now, a 
bystander who took a rifle and -- and started shooting, 
that™s -- that™s a litt
le bit different, that 
becomes participation or assist ance. There mi ght 
be other problems with the proof in that case, 
because if it was just a by -- i 
-- if we™re just dealing with a 
bystander, hi s connection to an 
official organization would be di
fficult if not impossible to prove. 
But in terms of just standing 
and watching an act of pe rsecution take 
place, this was not sufficient by itself.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
28 
 
Q: And advocation does not mean simply intell
ectual advocation. Th-There seems to be some  
implication of some kind of act
, not simply believing that this
 -- whatever I™m watching should 
be done, right?  I mean, it™s -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- not an ideolo -- it™s not
 an ideological advocation. 
A: As we looked at it, i-in the United States 
we -- we tend to have 
a tradition of not holding 
people criminally or civilly responsible for the 
things that they belie
ve in, no ma tter how bad 
they are. But advocation in this sense we looke
d at very much in -- in a way that would be 
similar to a -- a -- potentially 
a criminal case, in that the pe
rson was advocating in a public 
forum, wher e the statements that the person wa
s making, whether it was a 
speech, or in the print 

me dia, or over the radio, would be calculated to 
incite raci al hatred, 
and from which actual 
events took place that involved killing, or persec 
-- other persecution of individuals on the basi s 
of race, religion, national origin or  political 
opini on. And we did have cases against seve ral 
propagandists. Viarel Trifa was perhaps the best 
known in the early years, but there were others, 
Verence Korair, wa -- who, as a Hungarian news
paper editor in Transylvania, and Vladamir 
Sokolof wrote for a Russian paper 
in central Russia that was p
ublished by the Wehr ma cht for the 
local population. 

Q: So is -- is the principle ba
sed on the -- the holz -- I don™t wa
nt to call it a 
doctrine, but you 
can™t yell -- you can™t yell fire in a theater, you don™
t have the freedom of speech to do that, but 

if that, sayi ng that? 

A: It™s more in the -- it -- it -- 
it™s mo re in the cont ext of actively 
inciting acts of violence or acts 
of persecution on the basis of racial
 hatred, or relig
ious prejudice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

Q: Right, no, I un -- I understand, but what it me an
s is th-tha t speech has an active component. It 
isn™t -- si  -- speech is not 
simply speech all the time. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Is -- 

A: I -- I -- okay, I understand -- 

Q: That™s -- that™s what I mean
t, I didn™t mean that it was -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- equiva lent because yelling fire in 
a theater is not exac
tly the same  thing. 
A: Yes, yes, it would -- i-it wou --
 it really wasn™t in any of ou
r cases an individual act of speech, 
no ma tter how heinous. It was really in -- in 
all of these cases an individual who held a 
responsible position either as a journalist or as 
a propaganda official, or 
as a newspape r editor 
who was responsible for content of speech or pr int 
media that incited to racial hatred and from 
which we could argue reasonably th
at actions of persecution create
d an atmosphere in which acts 
of persecu -- acts of pers
ecution could be justified. 
Q: All right, let -- let me 
go back and -- and ask you -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- about sort of the context in which 
you -- into which you came  when you went to 

Washington as this young PhD person, in this new -- 

A: Not quite PhD yet, but -- 

Q: Oh you -- no, not yet? 

A: When I moved to Washington I 
had not quite finished the PhD. I had to fini -- I moved to 
Washington on the first of January 1980, and I got th
e PhD I believe a year and a half later.  
Q: Wow, so you were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
30 
 
A: In November ™81. 
Q: So you were working full time as -- at th
e same  time you were finishing a dissertation. 

A: Yes. I got most of the writing done between
 1979 -- during the year 1979, which enabled me  
to be editing at the time I was working full time.I worked part time from ™ 78 to ™80, while I was 

in New York. 

Q: Uh-huh. So what did you come  in to?  What was 
the -- ha -- what was the organization like?  

Were there a lot of people now that -- 

A: The organization had moved over from the immi
gration service to the criminal division. It 
made a phys ical move into -- in the old days with
 the immi gration service we were in a gigantic 
room, separated by small partitions and there 
were ma ybe -- oh, if I reme mber, ma ybe between 
10 and 15 of us, from attorney to secretary. 
And when I came  down to Washington in 1980 to 
begin full time work, we were all of a sudden a st
aff of over 40, each -- almost each of us with 

his or her own office, although I shared an office 
with two others, which reflected the status of 
the historians in that early period. And we -- 
we had roughly, if I reme mbe r  correctly, around 20 
attorneys, around 10 or 15 investigators and then 
the rema ining 10 or 15 were a comb ination of 
historians, paralegals and other 
support staff. And at the time, 
Rockler, Wa lter Rockler, who was 
the first director of the OSI, ga
thered together a nu mber of attorneys, private -- from private 
practice or other governme nt agencies, and a numb
er of investigators, almost all from other 
federal agencies ranging from the custom service to
 state departme nt security to the INS for that 
matter. And this unit was melded together in a 
relatively short period of nine months, into a 
fairly effective investigative -- combin
ation investigative and litigative unit. 
Q: Do you reme mber the first meeting?  Wa s there one? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
31 
 
A: There probably was, but I don™t reme mber it. 
I™ve never been a great fan of meetings, and -- 
but I don™t -- I -- I don™t -- I do remember the me
eting at which it was announced that we were 
going to file two new cases, and it may have been 
the first two that were filed subsequent to my 
arrival in Washington, and that was the case 
against Kairys, who was a camp guard at the 
Treblinka labor camp, and against Swubsakof who 
was a me mber of a auxiliary SS unit fr -- 
from -- operative in the Caucasus. That second 
case was ultimately dropped. But I do reme mber 
a meeting at which it was announced that those 
two cases were filed, and that had to be 
some ti me  during 1980. 
Q: So what -- all right, so you 
can™t reme mber a meeting, all right
. So I was trying to figure out 
how -- 

A: Specifically. 

Q: Specifically, right. But how -- were the historia
ns sort of the low people on the totem pole in 
this group? 
A: I-In terms of the professional st
aff support staff at this point we
 were, in fact, the low persons 
on the totem pole. Genera lly the United States 
governme nt when it -- when it prosecutes, it has 
investigators develop cases, and then attorneys 
prosecute them. And in 
many ways the attorneys 
and the investigators, most of whom were ver
y, very good, came  with thos
e ideas in mi nd of how 
things should run. And I reme mber being intervie
wed -- the historians were originally under the 
investigative wing, and I was interviewed by the chie
f of investigations in the new unit, when I 
was applying to come down as a full time worker
, to move to Wa shington. And his question to 
me -- or, it was more of a statement than a questi
on, well you™re not going to 
be able to write any 
books down here. And the idea, the 
implication was that what a hist
orian did was go to a library 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
32 
 
and read books. And unfortunately
 he was even wrong on that par
ticular thing because see that 
tome -- I wrote that  Trifa tome -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- within a year after 
he ma de that statement. But what happened was, as we got the cases, we 
began to investigate them as a hi
storian would investigat
e them. And in order to
 --  they were like 
little biographies, and I ha -- of course, had wr
itten a biography for my 
dissertation, and it was a 
biography of an individual, the ch
ief of the Nazi security polic
e SD, Ernst Karltenbrunner, who 
had left very little of himself behind. And I 
had to go at his biogra
phy by dealing with the 
organizations to which he belonged, and by d
ealing with the indivi
duals with whom he 
associated. And in ma ny ways, OSI, on a much lower 
level, dealt with that type of investigative 
process. And so what the hist
orians started to do, and now again my colleague, my former 
colleague David Marlowe and I talked about this
 quite a bit when we were both at OSI as young 
historians, what we started to do was to ga
ther documentation, prim
ary source documentation. 
We understood, as historians what kinds of docum
entation bore what weight of reliability. We ™d 
gather docume ntation on the institutions that were 
relevant  to the char ges in the complaint. We™d 
gather information on the individual, but we™d al
so gather information on the comr ades of the 
individuals. And this served tw
o purposes. On the one hand we wanted to talk to those comr ades 
if they were still alive, becau
se they could tell us things th
at the victims of the defendant 
couldn™t, and they could also tell us about the 
daily routine, which th -- which information the 
defendant was not going to giveus. We couldn™t get it from anyother source other than the hints 

that were left  in the documentation. And for a 
second reason is that the personnel ma terial, and 

the admi nistrative ma terial of the organization 
that these people belonged to, whether it was a 
concentration camp, or a security police unit, or
 an auxiliary police unit, gave us a fairly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
33 
 
accurate, and fairly reliable picture of what the daily
 life of this defendant  was, so that an expert 
witness could get up in fr ont of a judge and say 
with complete conviction that on a daily basis, 
on a norma l day, so and so rotated into these part
icular guard assignments, and this was part of 
his daily duty. Now, ma ybe he didn™t do it on this 
day or that day, but if you take a period of 
time, whether it was a week or three months, he wa
s doing it in this order at least some  time, and 
that this was part of the daily 
routine, the standard operating pro
cedure of this particular unit in 
this ti -- particular place. And so in gatheri
ng this type of documentation, we were able to put 
together cases that were based on paper. 
Q: Right. 

A: And were not subject to th
e inaccuries -- inaccuracies and 
shifts of personal me mo ry. The 
attorneys and the investigators 
were often used to working primarily with live bodies, with 
witnesses, whether it was an expert  witness, an 
expert hi stor ical witne
ss, and expert forensic 
technician, a survivor witness, even a -- a pe
rpetrator witness. But 
a live body who could say 
what happene d, meaning more than the paper 
documentation. And because of some of the 
problems with the early witness statements, particul
arly survivor statements, we came to rely on 

in part, I think, because the -- of
 the historians work, more solidly on the documentation and the 
witnesses, particularly the survivor witnesses be
came much more important to show to the judge 
what it was the victims underwent as a result 
of the defendants partic
ipation, assistance or 
advocation in persecution. And it 
changed remo -- this was some
thing that historians and 
attorneys in particular, and inve
st -- investigators to 
a certain degree, sort of worked towards 
without consciously sayi ng this is how we™re going to 
change  it, this was just -- it just became a -
- a -- I won™t say instinctual dynami
c, but a professional dynamic in that the historians wanted to 

know everything they could about
 the way a place ope
rated, and how the pe
ople operated within 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
34 
 
a place. And the attorneys and the investigators 
wanted to win cases. And the combination of 
those two elements produced cases that we could put
 on that were based primarily on paper, that 
went through an expert histor
ical witness. But the witness™
s testimony alone was usually not 
enough. We  tried as much as possible to have 
the elements of the e
xpert witness testimony 
backed at every point  by a specific piece of paper th
at the judge could read and say yes, I can see 
why he comes to that opinion. So that the judge, 
if the judge chose, could go back and pick apart 
the component parts of the expert™s testimony. A
nd that was the idea that we developed. And by 
we, I say both historians and atto
rneys working together, that we
 developed, in terms of putting 
together a case that we felt woul
d be as airtight as possible.  
Q: I don™t wa nt to keep saying that we™re goi
ng to go back, but in a way I™m going back. Ho-
How in heaven™s name  do cases come ?  Wi  -- di
d it change over the years, or what -- 
A: That™s a good question. Yet -- i-in the early days, 
in -- in some  of the more fa mous cases that 
came about in this way, it could come  either from
 rumors from the old country, like Trifa was -- 
charges surfaced against Trifa both from the ra 
-- Communist Roma nian 
regime , but also from 
Romanian émigrés from the mo ment  he ste
pped off the boat as a displaced person in 1950. 
Andrea Artukovich was uncovered by, I believe, 
I -- I can™t reme mber, but I think he was 
actually seen and denounced by someone. There we
re people who would pick up on rumors. The 
Soviets would float pamphlet lit
erature in the United States 
denouncing this person or that 
person. Maikovskis was denounced in the early 60™s
, after having been tried and sentenced to 
death in absentia, in a typical So
viet style trial in the early 1960™
s. And the response of the early 
authorities in the seven -- in th
e early 70™s was to follow these leads and be  reactive to what was 
comi ng in fr om the outside. When the OSI hired fu
ll-time  historians to work on the cases that 
were floating around, and the OSI inherited 300 --
 approxima tely 350 from the INS, ma ny of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
35 
 
which had been kicking around since the 50™s and th
e 60™s uninvestigated, particularly after the 
Artukovich fiasco in the mi d-50™s.
 The historians, in their search for documentation relating to 
the place or places where the defendants served, 
and relating to the units in which the defendants 
served, came across rosters of individuals, ma ny of
 them with birthdates
 and birthplaces. And 
early on, beginning even in 1980, the investigators we
re running lists -- po
st-war lists developed 
by American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigrati
on and Naturalization 
Service to see whether ma tches had taken place, or
 whether there were hits, we called them hits. 
That the indi -- an individual of the same  na me , a
nd same  birth year at least, and it™s o-often the 
same birthdate, of this war crime suspect had actu
ally entered the United States on such and such 
a date. Once we started collecti
ng rosters, this became  a -- a --
 a fairly large operation, and we 
were the first and only unit outside of the federa
l republic of Germany, a nd the Soviet Union to 
investigate in this way. And so we began, I 
would say, certainly by 1982 - 1983, 95 percent if not 
better of our cases originated in 
this way. The historians would gath
er rosters in the course of one 
a -- investigation, in order to identify other me mber
s of that unit, in part
 as potential sources for 
witnesses, and in part as potential evidence for 
that particul ar investig
ation. And then would run 
those name s through the Immi gration and Naturali
zation Service, to determine whether these 

people came to the United States. And if we could determine whether they came to the United 

States then th-they either becam
e witnesses themselves that we 
wanted to talk to about their 
comr ades, or they became  -- and in mo
st cases they did become subjects. 

Q: It would seem sort of, I don™t know, nor -- 
natural to me  that these people would have 
changed their name s. They would have come  in with no identification, sa
y, the war, I don™t have 
any identification, this is my na
me , and then you™d never find them. 
A: You would think that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
36 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You would think that, and it -- 
it certainly happened in the cas
e of Artukovich, he did change 
his name, and he did get in under a false name. Ho
wever, mos t  of the people who came  in were 
small fr y. Most of them were certainly aware that  ther e was so me documentation about 

themselves, had existed at one time . Some  of 
them were under the impression that the Nazis 
destroyed personnel documentation. Others understood 
that in the late 40™s
 and the early 50™s, 
that where the documentation was, was in a pla
ce that at that time was inaccessible to -- 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: -- to western investigators.
 And at the time of the Displ
aced Persons Act and the Refugee 
Relief Act, those who applied would have 
to go through a background check to determine 
whether they were eligible. And these b
ackground checks were conducted by the counter-
intelligence corps of the United Stat es army. And 
they would make a check to the usual sources 
of documentation that were availabl e at the time.
 These incl uded the Berlin document center, and 
the German arme d forces information agency, as well as regional German police agencies. Now, 

most of these people, most of the OSI subjects
, 90 percent if not bett
er, were from e a stern 
Europe and most of them were s mall fry, and mo
st of them were either non-German, or were 

ethnic Germans from the  east. So if they were not 
at a certain level, or  
had not been me mbers of 
the SS or the Nazi party, the Berlin document 
center check would surface
 nothing, and the arme d 
forces information check would surface, if anythi ng, possibl y and -- the na me  of an army unit or 

a police unit, and nothing more. Wh en the individua
l was called in, if all the inve -- all the vi ce 
consul had, or the counter-int elligence corps investigator had was the number of a police unit, 

well, the investigator was essentially at the merc
y of what the applicant had to say about what 
those duties were. I mean, you could be guardin
g buildings in a polic
e unit, and under the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
37 
 
amended Di splaced Persons Act, that would not render you ineligible. There was just no access 
to the type of documentation that became availa
ble only beginning with the west German trials 
in the 60™s, and to the United States investigator
s after the period of déte
nte in the early 70™s. 
Q: I don™t know if you can comment  on this, so
 obviously you™ll say no if you can™t. We™ve 
known, I don™t know for how ma ny y
ears about Operation Pa per C
lip, and the ways in which 
certain people were brought in by the governme nt in
 order to help us, esp
ecially in science. And 
their past was whited out. Wa s 
it ever -- was there ever a time that you got -- as OSI got -- 
some body sl ipped the information and that you we
re now in a position to know that we were 
protecting a Nazi, and 
then what happened? 
A: With Operation Paper Clip, we
 actually did have one case i
nvolving an Operation Pa per Clip 
subject, Arthur Rudolf, whom we di d end up -- he
 denaturalized hims elf essentially, by default. 
The difference with Operation Paper Clip, and th
e problem with Operation Paper Clip for the -- 
for proc -- litigation in 
this context wa s that these individu
als were brought specifically to the 
United States, not despite what they™d done, but 
because of what they™d done. And this, if you go 
back to the context of that time, the purpose of
 bringing them to the United States was number 
one, to obtain whatever mi ssile expertise they mi
ght have, and also to deprive the Soviet Union 
of that mi ssile expertise. Which, whatever the mor a
lity of the situation is
, looking back at it at 
that time, it was not an unreasona
ble decision given the national s
ecurity interests at the time. 
This, obviously, did present a prob
lem in the 1970™s and 80™s when we were looking into these 
investigations, because one could not say that 
the person gave false information. Another issue 
that was problema tic is that ma ny of these people
 had, in the broader context, a rather ma rginal 
connection with the persecution. The connection wa
s generally at its worst responsibility for 
forced laborers, perhaps denouncing a forced labo
rer for -- for not working hard enough, as a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
38 
 
result of which that forced laborer would be se
nt  to a concentration ca
mp, or sent to a worse 
concentration camp, or a worst case scenario, exec
uted. This was clearly some thing that was not 
a priority for U.S. officials in the 40™s and 50™s 
when they were trying people, they were trying 
people who were shooting people. They were tr
ying people who were dir
ect, hands-on killers, 
and they had plenty of them. By the 1980™s, because
 the bi g fry were either already tried, or die -
- had died, there was a broader and more intens
ive public and legal conc
entration on different 
types of connections with Nazi crimes, and the 
connection with forced labor was clearly one of 
those. The ro -- for the roc -- for the majority of
 the rocket  scientists, their connection with the 
forced labor was in comp arison to that of a 
concentration camp guard, or a police official, 
relatively marginal. So the cases were that much
 tougher to prove, even 
without the problem of 
why the me n were brought in.  
Q: Okay. So now you got a case. Now what happe
ns?  Is there a team and you sit around and you 
strategize, Pe ter, you have to do 
this, we need this from you. Or 
do you just get the case and then 
you all go off in your own separa
te directions?  What happens? 
A: No, it™s --  it -- it --  it™s much more systema
tic than that. Cases are developed through the OSI 
research and development departme nt. This is adepartme nt that grew out of the investigative 

wing of the unit in the mid-1980™s, 
and it is responsible for the -- it
 -- i-it -- it functions among 
many other things, as a transmission belt for thes
e name s that are dredged up by the historians, 
based on the original documentation to and from th
e INS. If a hit occurs where a person of the 
same  na me  and same  birthdate as some one w
ho is a suspect of being a member of a unit 
involved in Nazi offenses, has al
so entered the United States, th
e research and development unit 
also takes several ot her steps to de termine whet
her the person is still in the United States, 
whether the person is still alive, and whether 
the person is in good health. And also to ma ke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
39 
 
certain that the individual who resides in the Unite
d States is identical with the indi vidual whose 
name a-appears on the roster that -- that was orig
inated in the Nazi era. Once all of those bases 
are covered, so to speak, then the research and development -- the chief of the research and 

development, I think her -- her name  is Elizab
eth White, we had Dr. Black and Dr. Wh ite, and 
she then opens a case, gives it an OSI number and 
it become s an investiga
tion. The case is then 
assigned to an attorney and to a 
historian, and to a para
legal. And together the historian does the 
investigations, and OSI has some  mi nima l inve
stigative personnel to 
locate people, locate 
witnesses, locate files from fede
ral agencies. But the historiandoes the investigation, works at 
the investigation to a point where the attorneys 
consider it ready for what we call a pr e- filing 
interview. Cause we assu me  that all defendant
s are innocent until pr oven guilty, and that there 
could be some  explanation for whatever it is we
™ve put together. We  obvi
ously, if we get to the 
point where we want to talk to some one, we obvi
ously feel that we have a -- a good -- we being 
the U.S. governme nt, feels that we have a good case
, that we can litigate if necessary, but there™s 
always a possibility that there™s a reasonable ex
planation for the documentation that we find in 
our hands. And so we usually atte
mpt to interview the subject of the OSI investigation prior to 
filing a case. And as citizens -- if they™re citizens,
 the subject can refuse to speak to us. Doesn™t 
have to come . It™s a civil case, the subject does no
t have to appear. If the 
subject is an alien, the 
subject must appear, but he does not have to say 
anything to us, other than
 name , rank and serial 
number, if he wants. Based on that pre-filing 
interview, depending on what the unit gets, and 
depending on what that means for the case, th
e direction of OSI ma ke
s a determination of 
whether a case, a complaint, or an order to 
show cause should be filed. And then once that 

determination is made, the -- the documentation 
is drafted, and a case is filed in court. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
40 
 
Q: Let me  a -- let me  ask you how the priorities 
are set. You™ve got a -- you can have hundreds 
of rosters, ma ybe thousands of rosters,
 and ma ybe you can make hundreds of possible 
connections. Who is the person who decides? Is ther
e sort of a hierarchy of
 i mportance?  Or is it 
simply whatever come s up first, well this wo
rks, let™s -- let™s take
 it, I mean how -- 
A: It -- no, this -- generally the hierarchy of 
importance revolves around the likelihood of an 
individual belonging to a 
specific unit that is in its daily r
outine involved in persecution. So we 
will go the u -- the United States government will push names for instance, of concentration 
camp guards before they mi ght push the name s of 
a -- an obscure police unit in an area that 
we™re not sure that there was persecution, at 
least Holzma n type persecution. We  will push 
Trawniki train guards fairly quick
ly, though if we have Trawniki 
train guards who came in late 
1943 or early 1944, they mi ght not have the same pr
iority as a Trawniki 
train guard who was at 
Belzec. 

Q: Right. 
A: Or at Sobibor. Then of course, we™re gonna
 -- we™re going to put a 
higher priority. The 
priority -- priorities that  are assi gned tend to 
reflect our experience in what constitutes a 
winnable case.  
Q: But the -- the role of the historian here, beca
use at least in the beginning, I™m assumi ng that 
the lawyers and the paralegals don™
t know much of this history, a
nd that you historians are the 
ones who can say look, this is really more importa
nt. Or am I -- or am I wrong?  Did -- did they 
come in with a lot of
 knowledge as well? 
A: They™re -- OSI has several a
ttorneys who™ve been around for -- 
Q: Now for a period -- right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
41 
 
A: -- a long time. So they have -- they have a goo
d sense -- and -- and they™ve prosecuted a lot of 
cases, and so they have a good sense of what 
constitutes a winnable case
. And they can also 
impart that good sense to the 
newer attorneys, who -- there™
s much more turnover among the 
attorneys than there is among the historians. But 
the process of opening cases is a process that™s 
more or less run by my former colleague, 
Elizabeth White. She is the one who ma kes a 
determination on whether a case should be openedor not. It does go through her superior, her 
direct superior who is the director of the offi
ce, Eli Rosenbaum, and he -- he needs to approve, 

but I don™t know of any cases where he has re
jected a recommendation from her that a case be 
filed. She™s -- 

Q: Would -- would she go to you and -- and ask y
our advice on whether a case should be opened, 
or did she really -- 

A: She™s been around long enough -- she was a -- 
she was trained in German and European 
history and she™s been with the office since 
1983. And she™s been running the R and D section 
since the departure of David Marwel
l in 1988. So she™s quite capable -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and knowledgeable in her own right to know 
what constitutes a -- a -- a unit, based on the 
documentation that exists, what constitutes a unit 
that -- who™s an -- individuals are likely to 
participating in persecution. 

Q: So if we would take an example like the Tr
ifa case which -- I think 
we ought talk about the 
notion of advocacy here, and propaga nda and -- as
 well. But how -- you wrote this huge tome, I 
don™t know, six or sev -- 800 pages, it™
s huge. It™s very heavy, Peter. 
A: It is heavy. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

Q: At what -- do you write a short version of 
that in order to say 
to the lawyers and the 
investigators, look, here is a lot of information, 
we really should move ahead. So -- or did you do 
all of that  before the actual complaint is filed?  I mean, how -- 
A: That™s a good question, and -- and -- and actu
ally the Trifa case is probably not a good 
example -- 

Q: Uh-huh, then pick another one. 

A: -- because it™s an early case. 

Q: Okay. 

A: But I -- I didn™t -- I -- I 
feel I should explain why that tome  is
 so big. It has to do with some  of 
the specifics of the Trifa case. 
Trifa was not a case which was 
developed by OSI. It was a case 
that was developed through denunc
iation. And Trifa in his defe nse was able to ma ke statements 
that were half-truths, that 
required a significant 
amount of docume ntation to develop an 
understanding among the attorneys of what the actual
 truth was. Trifa, for example, was able to 
say he was incarcerated in a concentration camp 
during the war. And what did that mean?  He 
was able to say that the Roma nian Iron Guard 
was anti-Germa n. What did that me a n?  He could 
say that the Germans di dn™t trust the Iron Guard. What did that -- all of those things we re -- were 

truth, but they weren™t the whole truth. And th
e whole truth was depende
nt on a rather acute 
analysis of what the documentati
on was, what the conditions were
 like for the Iron Guards when 
they were in German captivity. It
 was clear from t he documentation. But it took 40 pages of that 
particular part of the case to 
explain to the prosecuting attorn
eys, and also -- who would then 
explain it to the judge, through th
e expert witness, of what ex
actly was the nature of the 
persecution of Trifa. The same  is true for the 
Iron Guards anti-Germa
n behavior, or the Iron 
Guards rebellion against the Fascist Romanian 
military dictatorship which was backed by the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
43 
 
Germans. And for Trifa™s own par
ticular role in persecution, which 
was -- had to be shifted from 
the original emphasis on physical mi streatme nt of
 individuals, which came from witnesses, ma ny 
of whom didn™t, as it turned 
out, pan out, to a more -- persecution based more on advocation, 
particular ly within the student 
rubric, and student or
ganizations of exclusion and discrimi nation 
against Jews and Gypsies and Greeks in Roma ni a. 
And also towards a print advocation of -- with 
intent  to instill ha tred of these mi nority groups, and 
to help to create an atmosphere in which the 
authorities could, with reasona
ble support from the general p
opulation, engage in physical 
persecution of these individuals. An
d if you™ll notice in that partic
ular tome  at the end of each 
section, there is a contrast between Tr ifa™s st
atements, and what evidence exists, based on the 
historical context in the chapters
, that would contradict what Tr
ifa -- Trifa™s version of events. 
And that was an unusual case. 
Q: Right. 

A: A -- a mu ch more norma l type of reporting, and 
in fact it became institutionalized in the 90™s 
when courts began dema nding an expert witne
ss report, which was essentially a historical 
biography of the official duties of the defendant
. And I -- I don™t reme mber exactly which year 
we -- the courts began to require these reports, bu
t I think it was in the early 90™s. A much better 
example is the Schellong report, Conrad Schell
ong, who was a -- who was a concentration camp 
guard and security officer at Dachau in the ye
ars before the wa r, and I can tell you now that 

some one in OSI when I first at -- was assigned 
to the case was disappointed that he was only 
there before the war, and even said so mething to
 the effect, well before the war they were just 
like pr isons, weren™t they? And that
 signaled to me  as a historia
n that even before we went 
outside to deal with judges and 
defense attorneys, we had to lay a context for what Dachau was, 
and a context to prove, in a se
nse, that the people who were in
 Dachau, despite Nazi euphemi s ms 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
44 
 
and mi sstatements about who they were and why th
ey were there, were in that camp for  reasons 
of race, religion, national origin and political opinion -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and were being persecuted for those reasons.
 And a key hooker to that was dealing with the 
instrume nt, the legal police instrume nt of schut
zhaft, or protective de
tention is the loose 
translation. And by dealing with 
the regulations of protective 
detention, which was imposed by 
the Gestapo outside the concentration camp, and ha
d little to do with the individual™s sojourn 
within the camp, except to bring him or her in, or
 bring him or her out if he or she ma naged to 
survive. But the schutzhaft provided the proof that 
the people who were in that camp were in that 
camp because of their race, because  they were Je
wish in 1938, because of their national origin, 
because of their religious convictions , Jehovah™s W
itnesses, or because of their political opini on; 
Socialists, Co mmunists and -- and what have 
you. And that was quite clearly expressed in 
schutzhaft orders and in the discussion of what
 schutzhaft wa s and how schutzhaft wa s supposed 
to be applied in the documentati
on of the Gestapo, of the Reich Mi
nistry of the Interior, and of 
the concentration camp c o mmandants themselv
es. And so we -- we as historians were 
responsible for putting together a 
context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp, 
by what pseudo-legal means they
 came  into the concentratio
n camp, of how the guards were 
recruited, of what their duties were, and of how 
their daily duties invol
ved keeping these people 
in a place where they were being pe rsecuted on 
the basis of race, religion and so forth. And 
through that, if we could prove all of those fact
s, and we could prove th
at the defendant was a 
me mber of this unit, then we could prove -- then
 -- then a judge could reach a finding that this 
individual persecuted, or assisted -- particip
ated in persecution. And 
the purpose in writing a 
report, and pe ople always used to joke  about my 
long reports -- the purpose of writing the report 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
45 
 
was not only to inform the attorneys, but also to
 solidify in the mi nd of 
the historian, what the 
fra mework of this inquiry was going to be, and so th
at the historian could be 
sure that all relevant 
documentation, some of it -- some of which was 
often obscure and by itse
lf meaningless, how it 
fit in. And y -- we could use the 
report even though we didn™t s
how the reports to the expert 
witnesses until the cour ts began to require us to 
pr ovide an expert witness report, we didn™t show 
-- these were work product. But we would use th
e framework established 
by that report to work 
out the testimony of the expert witness, and then 
test it against the expert
 witnesses, cause after 
all, he was an independent indivi
dual, or she -- a-and I think most
 of our expert witnesses were 
ma l e .  

Q: Right. 

A: I think all of them we re ma le, I ca
n™t reme mbe r  a fema le expert witness. 
Q: W- Woul d they even get the re
port, or would they just -- 

A: No, they wouldn™t -- in the early 
days they would not get the report. 
Q: Right. 

A: The report was work product for the attorney
 and for the historian. But the attorney -- the 
areas that the attorney wa nted 
to cover in the testimony were 
informed by the contents and 
context that was reflected in the report. 

Q: Let me  a s k you a question of detail, cause it 
just struck me  the other day as I was reading 
through the requireme nts for what kind of persecution or torture, or advocacy, it never includes 

sexual preference. So that when you talk about t
hose people who were put into the concentration 
camps, especially before the war, there -- andI™m just wondering, is there a connection betw -- 

because the United States is not 
letting in people who said they were homosexuals at a certai n 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
46 
 
point, and that -- so it didn™t 
matter that ther e were homosexuals
 who were being persecuted in 
the concentration camps. Cause there™s no reference. 
A: You know, again, and here™s some
thing that I don™t -- I don™t --
 I -- I™m not sure of why it 
isn™t in there. I -- certainly in 1978, when th
e legislation was drafted, the focus on sexual 
preference, and on persecution for sexual pref
 -- on the basis of 
sexual preference, was 
unfortunately not as consciously not this -- not of
 the same  conscious concern to U.S. authorities 
or anyone else, frankly, as it is today. We  -- ther
e™s also, if you notice in 
the legislation, there™s 
no provision for the persecution of people who we
re engaged in what the Nazis called asocial 
behavior. 

Q: Right. 

A: Whether it was panhandling on the stre
et, or flashing, or what have you. 
Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: And part of the problem, no doubt , rests with -- the drafters of
 the legislation ma y well have 
felt, well we™re probably not going to
 pass this legislation at this time if we say that it™s wrong to 
persecute homosexuals when we have ma ny st
ates that still ha ve sodomy laws on the books. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we™re certainly not going to be able to 
pass this legislation 
if we count locking up 
panhandlers, or flashers or what
 have you, whatever asocial beha
vior you choose to -- to focus 
on, you™re not going to be able to pass this legisla 
-- we want to pass this legis -- we want to pass 
this legislation in very clear and convincing areas 
that we know at the time, in the cont ext of the 
70™s that there will be a consensus among Amer
icans that this is wrong, that we don™t want 
people who engage in this activity, persecution of
 these people, for these reasons in our United 
States. Do I know that for -- do I know that for -- 
whether that was really behind -- in the mi nds?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
47 
 
I don™t know, it™s speculation. But I 
suspect that wherever there wa
s the possibility that we the 
United States mi ght prosecute the same  things, 
this would clearly pr esent an argument for any 
defendant to say you [indecipherable] 
Q: And whe r e do Gypsies f
it into those categories? 
A: Gypsies would have -- Gypsies in -- in terms 
of that, we could have fit that into racial 
persecution. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay, so you -- 

A: And in fact we did use, in concentration 
camp cases, where Gypsies were in concentration 
camps -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- we used evidence of that to indicate pers
ecution on the basis of ra
ce. This was impossible 
to do, obviously, in the case of German homosexuals. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because the persecution was not on the basis of race, it was not on the ba sis of religion, it was 

not on the ba sis of national origin. It was not 
even on the basis of political opinion, at least not 
directly. And it is also true th
at for those homos exuals who were
 willing to ma ke the attitude 
adjustment, that they could get out, if they
 ceased practicing their 
homosexual activity, which 
was not so true for the Communists, at least on thehigher levels, or certainly not for the Jews at a 

later time.  

Q: And given what we said about what you just 
said, given the response in the American public 
against Communists, and our own treatment ofpe ople who were Communist, or who had that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
48 
 
inclination, would that ma tter 
if some body said, look, look at how you treat Communists here, 
it™s an outlaw party, or you know, you imprison pe
ople because of it, or you think they™re 
conpriri -- conspiring to overt
hrow the government. So I persecuted them, who cares?  Why -- 
you know, same  thing. Is [indecipherable] 

A: There -- that -- this clearly ha
d -- had their only been Communists -- 
Q: In there -- 

A: -- in a concentration camp, it -- it w
ould have been a problem, I think -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- because it would have been an issue that w
ould have been much harder to argue because of 
the United St ates own recent past , and recent hys
teria. The Vietnam war after all, was only a 
decade earlier, not to me ntion the McCarthy period
 here. That being said, 
I don™t recall, at least 
it™s not -- it hasn™t been in 
my history books, and there™s no reas
on to assume  that even at its 
worst, the United States governme nt treated Co mmunists the way the Nazi governme nt treated 
Communists. But it would have been
 a harder issue to argue -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- if it had been only Communi
sts. We  were not afraid, despite
 whatever mi sgivings we mi ght 
have had about the tactics of it, 
to argue that charge. That if it 
-- we -- we said Communists were 
in there because they expressed th
eir political opinion. If 
they were in a prison because they blew 
up a bridge, that was a little di
fferent, that would be a tough th
ing to argue. But a Communist 
newspaper editor in a concentra
tion camp was a person who was bei
ng persecuted on the basis of 
his political beliefs -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- political opinion. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
49 
 
Q: It™s so interesting beca use it™s 
--  it™s clear that the notion of crimin
ality, or -- is --  or is also so 
contextualized.  
A: Yes. 

Q: There™s no objective relationship between
 the law and the crime. In -- in a -- 
A: I™m not sure I -- 

Q: Well, you ha -- you -- people make decisi ons
 about what criminality is. So, in -- 
A: Yeah, in terms of discretion, people ma ke -- 

Q: Right, yeah, yeah. 

A: -- th-there™s a statue, and then of course
 any -- any prosecuting, or you know, assize case, 
litigating institution has discretion as to what level 
it™s going to prosecute, and that™s often -- or -- 

or litigate, and that™s often determined by 
whether a given case is winnable or not. 
Q: Right. 

A: Whether you can make an argument that will 
convince, in this case, a judge. And there you 
have to take into context the -- or take into acco
unt the context of an American judge in the early 
1980™s -- reme mber, that was the Reagan era, the er
a of the evil empire, sitting in an American 
courtroom and thinking about what constitutes persecution. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the persecution of political opinion has alwa
ys -- that ™s always been a bad thing in the 
United States, thankfully. It™s al
ways been a bad thing. It™s a g
ood thing that Nazis are able to 
speak, like Nazis here in the Unite
d States. It™s also a good thing th
at we prosecute them if -- if 
they commit a crime after having done so. But that™s
 some thing that we don™
t or shouldn™t -- our 
Constitution says we shouldn™t hold people liable, criminally liabl e for expression of their 

political beliefs.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
50 
 
Q: Although at various times suppression of speech obviously -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- happens in various for ms. I think what I 
was talking -- talking about, and we™ll -- we™ll 

close because the tape is going off 
is -- is that  for instance, if a 
Jew blows up a bridge against the 
Nazis, or a Communist -- forget
 the Communist mi ght 
be Jewish, but let™s say a Communist non-
Jewish person blows up a bridge during that particul
ar era, 60™s - 70™s - 80™s, it ma y be the case 
that some body would say, Jews right to blow it 
up, look what the Nazis 
are doing to the Jews. 
Communist isn™t, that™s terrorism. 
So that™s -- I think that ™s what
 I was referring to is pr ior to 
decision about whether you could ma ke a comp
laint and win in the courtroo m, which is 
obviously a strategic decision. 

A: Right. A-And -- and in a sense, that ma de partisan cases virtually impo
ssible for us to litigat e 
against, because in a se nse partisans were also, 
in occupied territories, 
were expressing their 
political opinion. 
Q: Right. 
A: That is not to be -- that they didn't want to
 be occupied by the Germans. But they were also 

blowing up bridges, and shooting German soldie
rs, and with the Vietnam experience fresh, and 
the parallel often drawn by our 
own attorneys, some  of whom 
had served in Vietnam, and 
certainly drawn by judges who had handled ci
vil cases involving pr
oblems dealing with 
Vietnam, this was obviously an issue that we were
n™t going to able to wi
n a case, even if the 
Communist happened to be
 a Jew, and the -- and the Communis
t Jew blew up a bridge, that an 
army occupying a country, unfortuna tely it has 
the right to kill people who are blowing up 
bridges.  

Q: Okay, we™re going to take a br eak 
now because the tape is running out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
51 
 
A: Good. 
Q: Okay. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
52 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Peter, can we talk about the -- the -- the way 
in which evidence is gathered? For instance, in 
the Trifa case, did all the -- the huge tome  that 
you wrote, was that all information you got from 
the archives in the United States, or we
re you able to get th
ings from Romania? 
A: There was a combination. Actually, I was not th
e first assigned to the 
Trifa case, it had pre-
dated OSI, and in fact pre-dated the SLU, the 
Special Litigation Unit in the INS, had actually 
been filed in the U.S. attorney™s office in Detr
oit, I believe it was, 
in 1975. Some  of the early 
resear ch for the SLU, in records both in the 
national archives and in 
Roma nia, were done by 
none other than Paul Shapiro, who worked as a c
ontractor for the SLU for a short time in ™78 - 
™79. I™m -- maybe ™77 - ™78. When I was hired an
d brought down to Wa shington, I had a look at 
the existing evidence, and there was 
still a s -- a number of gaps that
 needed to be filled at that 
point, prima r ily from ma terial that was held
 at the United States National Archives, and 
primarily from captured German records, SS reco
rds, and German foreig
n office records. And 
what I did wa s to gather the rest of that ma terial
 and pull that material, together with the material 
that had been gathered from Roma ni a, and with some  newer ma terial that had been gathered 
from the Library of Congress, which had the mone
toral officiale, which wa
s the legal gazette of 
the Antonescu regime  in Roma nia. And -- cause
 we weren™t at war w
ith Roma nia during the 
period that the Iron Guard was in power in 
the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941. And I 
integr ated the information fr om these various so
ur ces, into a narrative th
at was broken down into 
the topics that were relevant 
to our -- the components of our complaint and the defenses that 
Trifa had made against the charges of the governme nt.  

Q: So how is that huge docume nt used by the 
lawyers?  You -- you would write this, and then 
they would take it over? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
53 
 
A: In this particular  case, the lawyer s used it as
 a cheat sheet in a way, for developing a line that 
-- their line of questioning of the 
expert witness on direct examin
ation. And they also used -- it 
was written in such a way so that the attorneys co
uld use that which they needed, to deal with 
rebuttal questions that came  up on c r
oss-examination, the -- the questio
ns, if he says this to this, 
or if the pro -- if the defense attorn
ey asks the expert to explain this
, this is what -- this is a --  a 
reasonable response if the independent expert agrees. And some ti me s the defense attorney would 

not ask the question, and you wouldn™t need to
 introduce the e -- there was no reason to 
introduce the evidence on direct examination. 
Let me  see if I can think of a good exa -- good 

example. We could argue -- here™s an example, I 
-- I don™t reme mber if this exactly was in my 
mi nd at the time , or this be -- was an issue at th
e trial, but Trifa claime d 
that he was persecuted 
by the Nazis, that he was a concentration camp 
prisoner. Our direct examination involved his 
sojourn with the other Iron Guar
d leaders in the Birkenbrook SS 
house, where -- from where he 
had a special vacation for his stomach ulcers, where he was at spas, and going to movies, and 
writing home about -- home  to his buddies at Bi
rkenbrook about his stoma c h illnesses, and his 
me dicines, and what the weather was like, no
t -- not exactly the regul
ar concentration camp 
prisoner™s life. 
Q: Right. 

A: After Coriasima, the Iron Guard leader es
caped from Birkenbrook, and was tracked down in 
Rome  and brought back. At the behest of the 
foreign mi nistry, the SS did put the -- the Iron 
Guard leaders in a conc entration camp, I believe 
it was at Buchenwald, but I can™t remember 
where -- which camp at the mo ment. I think Seym
our went to Sachsenhausen and the rest of 
them went to Buchenwald. But even here, and th
is was the issue that was brought up for rebuttal; 
if he says, oh I was in a concentration camp, and 
I was treated poorly, even here there is evidence 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
54 
 
that the Iron Guard leaders we
re clearly prominent persons, kept in a separate compound, they 
had a radio they could listen to, and they even
 had a -- a -- Jehovah™s Witness as a -- as a -- a 
person who would clean their -- th
eir rooms, and what have you. 
Again, it was not the typical 
concentration camp existence, and they were clearl
y not in there because of
 Nazi persecution of 
their politics, they were in th
ere because the Nazis needed to keep tabs on them for foreign 
policy reasons, and they also wanted to keep th
em in reserve in the event that the Antonescu 
regime  ever tried to desert the 
axis, as it did in 1944. So it was th
at type of evidence that I felt, 
and other historians working on their cases felt
 that the attorneys ought
 to have, either for 
rebuttal purposes, or for their ge
neral background. And in some  cas
es it was information that the 
expert witness mi ght not have, but 
might be able to evaluate in a 
useful way, to frame his or her 
testimony.  
Q: Uh-huh. Wh- When the law -- when the lawyers 
would get this information from you, like -- 
like with the big book, would you then have a conversa -- would they sit with you and say, I 
don™t quite understand what this means, or how I 
can use it, I mean, was it
 transparent to them, 
how to use these things, or would th
ere be conversations between you -- 
A: This would be an ongoing -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- it would be an ongoing conversation that
 we  would have, and it would often be a 

conversation that we would have in the context 
of selecking -- selecti
ng specific documents, and 
giving them priority as to how we
 ought to use them. As I reme mber it, in our cases, in the cases 
I worked on, there were four levels of priority. We selected docume nts that we were definitely 

going to introduce as evidence on di
rect examination, through the ve
hicle of the expert witness. 
And this involved a whole procedure of ma king su
re that they were properly translated, ma king 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
55 
 
sure that they were properly 
certified as to the chain of cu
stody, which was particularly for 
ma terials from the Soviet Union, and the eastern bl oc, these were -- this could be a very, very 
complicated process. The second level requir
ed similar preparation because these were 

documents that were se lected to be used 
if necessa ry to rebut possible de fenses, or 
documentation submitted in support of possible de fenses. So in other words, you had to have 

these documents ready as if you wanted to move them into evidence, whether you moved them 

into evidence or not. But a decision to move th
em into evidence would be ma de, perhaps very 
close to trial, or maybe during th
e trial itself. The third level of priority were those docu ments 
that we felt that the expert w
itness should see. That we would 
not use them as evidence, they 
were not appropriate as evidence, either because 
they were not relevant, or because, for instance, 
they involved a witness statement where the w
itness was no longer alive and couldn™t be cross 
examined, and it was not an old enough docume n
t to come  in under an ancient docume nts 
exception to the hearsay rule. Or it was simply
 general background and general context that the 
expert witness should either see for the first time, 
or refresh his me mory a nd have it as part of the 
context of the case, but it was 
not necessary to introduce as evid
ence. It was something that the 
expert could talk about without
 having to document it. An example of tha t  mi ght be -- an 
example of t hat mi ght be a report about a specific
 event that occurred in 
1941, that was written in 
1944, either by the governme nt that perpetrated the 
event, or that was presiding over the event, 
or by the successor government. Was some thing that
 the expert probably 
should be aware of, but 
it was not some thing that was appropriate to use 
as evidence. And then the fourth rung were 
those documents that were either exonerating, or
 in some  way that could potentially adversely 
affect the case, so that the expert witness woul
d have an opportunity to
 know what they were, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
56 
 
and to reconcile them wi th the 
theory of the case as develope
d through this cooperation between 
the expert witness and 
the prosecution team.  
Q: Wa  -- I want to ask you more about 
that, but can you explain the hearsay rule? 
A: Well a -- I™m not a lawyer here -- 
Q: No. 

A: -- an -- and we move d document a tion, histor
ical documentation, not only contemporaneous 
German and other axis docume ntation, but even 
post-war interrogations under an -- an exception 
to the hearsay rule, which is 
called the ancien
t docume nts exception. And I believe to reme mber 
that the --  the year -- I think th
ere™s a year limit, and there is 
a requirement that the document is 
not created in the interests of the present proc
eeding. So in other words, it has to be old enough, 
first of all, so that there™s no shadow of a doubt
 as to whether the document was created for this 
proceeding. And by the same  token, it had to be 
totally d -- think of a good word -- totally de-
linked from the existing proceeding, cause technically
 even an order, written right prior to an 
operation, is a hearsay docume nt. The document only 
says what it says, it
™s not proof that the 
order was carried out, it™s not 
-- the signature isn™t proof that 
the person who signed it actually 
signed it, unless you test the handwriting, nor is 
it proof that the person who actually signed it 
read it, and intended that order to be -- to be 
implemented. But the expert witness could argue on 
the basis of his experience, on the basis of his 
having seen ma ny similar documents, that this was 
a norma l document of the type created by this type of
 agency in this type 
of situation. And that™s 
how this document came to be. And this went fo
r post-war interrogation pr
otocols as well, which 
were na -- not even word for word testimony. They were summaries that were written by police 

or prosecutors of what 
the witness sa id, and then the witne
ss later signed it, which is the norma l 
way of procedure in -- in contin
ental law. There™s no word for word witness testimony in a pre-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
57 
 
trial interrogation. The witness ta
lks, the prosecutor or police in
terrogator summarizes it, types it 
up, and the witness is -- is -- read
s it and then either signs to it 
or ma kes whatever changes the 
witness deems are a-appropriate and accurate. 
Q: So -- so this is why in the Hajda case, the 
early testimony of the sist
er and the father, in a 
totally separate, de-linked case coul d be accepted as
 to what they said about the -- the brother 
and the son. 

A: It ma y -- it -- it ma de it appropriate to move
 that info -- those documents into evidence. It 
came in under an exception to the hearsay rule. Now, 
as -- as far as the weight
 that™s given to that 
documentation, in that case, both the prosecution, fi
rst -- when we first got the ma terial, and the 
judge finally gave it what weight, 
as evidence he or she saw fit. A
nd in this case, in -- in that 
particular case, because of some  
certain specific -- spec
ificity of language of 
the sister™s -- of the 
sister™s description of the defendant™s unit, we 
-- we ga -- we, the pros
ecution and the judge as 
well, gave it considerable weight, because she 
used a term that she couldn™t have known, or 
wouldn™t have used. It wa s a foreign term, and it wa
s a specifi c unit, and she got part of that term 

right. She just wouldn™t ha
ve known it if he wasn™t, 
in fact, in that unit. 
Q: Uh-huh. So when you had expert witnesses, y-
you si -- the historians
 associated with OSI 
can™t act as expert 
witnesses, right -- 
A: No, that™s -- 

Q: -- you have to -- 

A: -- that has not happened as yet. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
58 
 
A: In fact, I will serve as an expert  witness for 
OSI this comi ng year in a case, and I am as -- as 
far as I know, the first former staff me mber, but 
I am a for mer staff me mber, because the expert 
is an independent expert -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and the historians on staff at
 this point, up to this point are --
 have still been considered in a 
self-censoring way by the pr
osecuting agency, as part
 of the prosecution -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and therefore vulnerable to
 charges by the defense that th
ey -- they know who they™re 
getting, th -- they know where their salaries 
come from, and they™ll testify accordingly.  
Q: Right. Now, do ex -- do the expert witnesse
s usually function -- now I™ve read one trial 
testimony a bout Hajda, and I don™t want to go -- neces
sarily go into the detail of that, but Charles 
Sidner is some body whose functio
n as an expert witness -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and I suppose Hillberg 
has functioned as a s -- 
A: Hillber g is an expert  witness. 
Q: A-Are their usual functions to add to this ki
nd of general picture, more than focusing on the 
particular person, placing that person™s unit, or
 what that unit mi ght ha
ve done in the larger 
context? Is that what the -- 

A: The expert offers eviden
ce on -- provided it™s there -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the expe rt offers evidence -- excuse me  -- 
on what the unit did, o-on the big picture, first of 
all, so we --  usually the --  the --  the way it™s laid
 out is we deal with id
eological issues, what the 
German ai ms were at the very top, what the 
specific conditions and ad
mi nistrative structures 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
59 
 
were in the particular region i
nvolved, and then getting down to 
the particular organization or 
organizations in chronological sequence as much 
as possible. And then going down as far as the 
documentation permits the expert to ma ke a judgmen
t. For instance, if the expert sees a month™s 
worth of guard rotation assignments
 at a concentration camp, that
 expert can talk about those 
rotations, because he™s seen enough 
evidence to convince him of how 
-- or -- or to define for him 
what the daily routine wa s like.
 If there™s no evidence, he ca
n speak about -- if there™s no 
evidence -- well, let me -- 
let me  retract that. If 
there™s -- if we don™t have
 the daily rotations, but 
only have evidence of the concentration camp wi thin
 the system, then the e
xpert, if he feels so 
comfortable in doing so, can talk about how 
-- what the normal routine was within the 
concentration camp system, and how in his expert
 opinion there™s no reas
on to assume  that for 
this particular concentr
ation camp, it went any way differentl
y. He cannot -- or I wouldn™t, as an 
expert witness, try to get into the detail as to 
who was rotated where at what time , or even what 
the specific places of rotation were. That you™d 
have to do on the basis of the evidence. You 
can™t know that if you don™t have
 the -- i-if -- if th
ere™s a gap in that documentation. And for 
instance, to give you an example, in the Schell
ong case, we didn™t have that documentation for 
Dachau. We  only knew that he was a security 
officer, and we knew that
 there were regular 
functions for security officers inconcentration camps. And the expert
 testified as to that. We  did 
have rotation rosters for the guards at Sachsenbur
g, where Schellong was at 
before he went to 
Dachau. And there the expert could talk very 
specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and 
such a day, was outside the bunker. 
Or that he checked in on the 
bunker as security officer every 
three or four hours, whatever th
e -- the case mi ght have been. For 
instance in the Hajda case, we 
could talk because we ha d, through a three tier
ed level of docume ntation, contemporaneous 
documentation of individuals who were in the Traw
niki system, and who served at the Treblinka 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
60 
 
labor camp, individuals who afte
r the war testified in wester
n countries, where there was -- 
where you didn™t have the baggage of what the Soviet
 system was like, that they had indeed been 
there, and done this, that and the 
other thing, and then of course, the 
Soviet protocols, in so far as 
the information contained therein was consiste
nt with the original documentation, and the 
testimony in the western protocols. And through 
a s -- a combination of those three types of 
sources, we were able to identi
fy where virtually every single 
individual who served at the 
Treblinka labor camp between March 1943, and its 
dissolution in July 19
44, where they were. 
We were able even to determine what happene
d to the people who appeared on one roster and 
were no longer on the other rost er. One was sent back because  he was a chronic drunk, and we 
had docume ntation -- hi s own testimony in that case
, that he became an alcoholic at Tr eblinka 
one. A post-war testimony in a German proceedi
ng, a west German proceed
ing. In another case, 
an individual deserted, and we found the -- the Ge rm
an wanted list, indicati
ng that this indi -- 
individual had deserted and was 
being sought at a time between the 
dates of the two rosters. And 
so the expert was able to speak in si gnifican
t detail about who was at 
Treblinka one, when, and 
what they were doing there; and in a way 
that was very convincing to the judge.  
Q: W- What is unique about the Trifa complaint 
in your -- in your view?  
Is it not common that 
one is making a complaint against someone who is
 an advocate, but notnecessarily who actually 
did the persecution, but was so -- is that
 what™s interesting 
about that case?   
A: I think Trifa™s -- the interest for Tr ifa -- we 
had a couple of journalists. Trifa was primarily a 
journalist, he was also a student
 leader. He was unique among OSI 
subjects -- well not u-unique, 
but rare among OSI subjects in that he was in the 
highest level of leadershi
p. He was next to the -
- he was in that group that was 
close to the -- the leader Horia 
Sima  hi mse l f. But he was -- he 
was unique in that much of what he said in his de
fense, in contrast to it being an outright lie, did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
61 
 
contain a grain of truth. And -- but 
was significant more for what he omitted to say, than what he 
actually admitted. In other words, Tr ifa was a concentration camp prisoner, or was ca -- I take 
that back, I™m going to withdraw that. He was, 
for a time , confined in a concentration camp. He 

was in the custody of the Germans. He was a me
mber of a move me nt that the Germans didn™t 
fully trust, and that rebelled against the regime
 that the Germans supported. All of these issues -- 
I can™t think at the mo ment of another defendant that, given the hope of 
prosecutorial ignorance, 
had a better defense in that he could rely on hal
f-truths, rather  than simply claimi ng to be in 
another place other than he was, 
or claimi ng to have been a combat soldier when he really was a 
concentration camp guard, or simply denying ever 
having served with the Germans, or in the 
Hajda case, as you saw, rather unwisely claimi ng 
that the information, though accurate as to his 
person, wasn™t him, that some body e l se was using 
his birth data, for reasons that no one could 
ever expl ain.  

Q: Did -- did Trifa actually come  to trial? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Trif -- it™s Trifa? 

A: Trifa, Trifa. 

Q: And he actually came to trial? 

A: Trifa came to trial twice -- I 
take that back, I withdraw that. 
He came to -- he was supposed to 
come to trial twice, both times -- once before the tr
ial at denat stage, and once during the trial at 
the deport stage, he threw in the towel. 

Q: At both time s?  

A: At both time s. Shortly before denaturalization, 
Trifa voluntarily turned in
 his certificate, and 
renounced his citizenship. Didn™t st
op him from appealing the deci
sion afterwards. His attorney, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
62 
 
a -- a m -- a man by the name of Wo ods, I think, I can
™t recall his first name , at that time  wrote a 
gigantic tome  in defense of Trif
a, and criticizing Trifa for withdr
awing, and bitterly attacking the 
governme nt for persecuting Trifa, which was anothe
r issue that we -- we had to deal with in 
putting together the de portation case, because we
 had every reason to be
lieve that once Trifa 
appealed the denaturalization deci
sion, which came  as a result of his voluntary act of throwing in 
the towel, we had every reason to believe that he 
would fight at deportation. And he did take it to 
trial at deportation, and I™m still convinced -- I was at the trial, I™m still convinced that due to the 
tremendous talent of the lead attorney on thecase, Kathleen Colema n, who still works for the 

Justice Departme nt, and the way she was orchestr
ating -- well, I co -- wouldn™t say orchestrating, 
the way she was permitting the expert witness, Ba yl
a Vargo, to explain the context of what this 
documentation relating to Trifa real ly meant, th
at of everyone in the 
courtroom, Trifa probably 
knew best where the testimony was going. 

Q: I see. 
A: And after two days of it -- the expert 
was on the stand for two days, Trifa™s lawyers 
approached Allen Ryan who was at the trial and 
again ultimately offe red to throw in the towel 
and agreed to an order of deportation.  
Q: And why would some body do that?  To not 
pay money to his lawyer, or to -- 
A: I h -- I ha -- I don™t kn
ow exactly, but this -- th
is is only speculation on
 my part that Trifa -- 
Trifa, perhaps even better than the judge, saw th
at -- saw what the prosecution was proving, what 
we were capable of proving in the courtroom. There could be other reasons, Trifa ma y have felt 

that this was too much of an embarrassment. This
 ma y have be en an issue at the denaturalization 
stage, after all, he wa
s the head of the Roma ni
an American Orthodox church, he wasn™t just a 
private citizen. Which certainly he
lped in terms of funding to pa
y his lawyers, but mi ght have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
63 
 
been a problem in terms of his parishioners. Th
ere ma y have been problems in the church. Other 
church leaders ma y have been a little upset at 
Trifa™s posi -- Tr ifa being who he was, and what 
that was doing to the reputation of the rom -- 
Roma nian American church, but I don™t know that. 
I don™t know what went into that ultima
te decision to throw in the towel. 
Q: Peter, you said you were at the trial, that y -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- that -- the tri -- th
e deportation, cause the --  
A: The deportation hearing, yeah. 

Q: Do you have a role there as part of
 the staff, are you simply an observer? 
A: No, we definitely -- the hist
orian is definitely a part of
 the prosecution team. This was 
some thing that came to be established fairly early 
on. I was at the -- the firs
t case that I went to 
trial with was the Schellong case, which went, I 
believe in the summer of 1981, and I also was at 
the trial in the Maikovskis case. 
And the role the historian played
 there was a -- ultimately, other 
than the expert, the case histor
ian has the strongest knowledge of
 the historical docume ntation, 
we™re talking in the Trifa case we had over 700 
exhibits, and the historian, more than the 
attorney coul d pull not only the exhibits that were
 geared for exhibits, but 
the exhibits that were 
there as background, that were -- m- mi ght become
 i mportant for one reason or another during the 
course of the trial. Only the historian had that 
knowledge at his -- or in El izabeth White™s case, 
hers -- her fingertrip -- her fingertips. 

Q: Right. 

A: And this was some thing that relieved the 
attorney of having to worry about that. And it 
relieved the paralegal, who could read the transl
ations but could not read
 the original documents, 
and if there was a discrepancy it relieved the 
paralegal of having to worry about that, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
64 
 
allowed him or her to concentrate on the location,
 the physical location of 
the individual exhibits. 
There was another function as well. One -- one ne
ver knew what kinds of defenses would come  
up, what kinds of issues would come  up at trial.
 There mi ght be an unanticipated defe nse, an 
unanticipated piece of evidence, some thing that the 
-- that the defense would introduce at the last 
mome nt, whether it™d been turned over in di scovery or not. One could never know whether the 

judge would let it in, regardless of what the 
rules were, and the rules were pretty lax in 
immi gration court. And the historian had to be ther
e in or der, if it were in
 a foreign language, to 
read the language, and also to analyze the cont ex
t of the document so that the prosecution could 
be ready to move forwa r d, regardle
ss of the issue. And so it was -- it was very much to ma nage 
the knowledge -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- ma nage the data, not -- not the knowledge but 
the data contained in the documents, and also 
as a preventative, a prophylactic measure a-against 
surprises in -- in terms of evidence that the 
defense mi ght present, or  materials that the 
defense mi ght present th
at the prosecution didn™t 
anticipate. 

Q: Now wha t  languages are 
you fluent in, so if -- 

A: I could read German, in which mo st of th
e documentation was involve
d, and during periods in 
my career, I could read some  k
itchen Polish and kitchen Roma nian. I™ve forgotten both of the 
last two. I can still pick out certain words, but 
if there was some thing that was purported to be a 
police document for instance, depending on the 
letterhead, you could get a se -- an immediate 
sense of whether this was a genuine document or not
, and be in a position to advise the attorney, 
look, we need to have a recess, we need to faxthis back to the office, we need to get some body 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
65 
 
to look at it and translate it, to 
-- to take those steps, if necessa
ry, to get the contents of the 
document availabl e to the prosecution team. 
Q: What did the room look like?  What kind of 
a room was it?  Was it a courtroom courtroom, or 
was it a --  

A: Yes, it was a courtroom. It was a courtroom
 -- in every case it was a courtroom not so 
different than the kinds 
that you see on court TV. 
Q: Yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And so you would sit at -- at the 
left or right side [indecipherable] 
A: The historian would be, in most
 cases, at the very beginning, th
ere was a sort of an attorney - 

not attorney thing, and the 
attorneys wanted to sit at the table,
 and the historian was to be in the 
front row of the audience -- 

Q: I see. 
A: -- but given the practical mo me nt um or -- or
 dynami c of how a tria
l went, the attorneys 
quickly -- the lead attorneys quickly insi
sted that the historian be there -- 
Q: Be there. 
A: -- be there. And the attorney
s -- you would often have two or 
three attorneys in a case, and 
each attorney was responsible for different witn
esses and di fferent parts of the presentation, 
you™d have a -- an introductory argume nt most
 of the time, you™d have a closing argume nt. 
You™d have one attorney responsib
le for the expert witness, whic
h was after all the crux of the 
prosecution™s case. That same  attorney, or possibl
y another attorney would be responsible for the 
testimony of the defendant, if the defe ndant wa
s either called -- occasionally we called the 
defendant as a prosecution witness,
 but more often the defendant te
stified in his own behalf, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
66 
 
the governme nt™s attorney then had an opportun
ity to cross examine. Then you had another 
attorney, mo re often a -- a -- a 
more junior attorney 
responsible for survivor witnesses and for 
witnesses who testified as to the immi gration pr
ocess, th-the qualificatio
ns for certification as 
refugee, the qualifications for certification 
as a displaced pe rson, and the vice counsels. 
Q: And could other people 
be there?  Was this -- this was an open hearing? 
A: These were public trials. 
Q: They were public trials? 

A: Yes, they were public trials. 
I don™t recall -- certainly none of
 the cases I was involved in was 
a see -- was a si -- 
was a closed trial.  
Q: Reporters could come  as well? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And report on what wa s going on? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Oh, yes. 

Q: We re expert witnesses rehearsed, or
 were they supposed to be to -- 
A: They were prepped the way any witness would 
be prepped in any kind of civil or criminal 

case. Our witnesses -- w-we™d go 
over the questions we wanted to
 ask them, and listen to their 
answers, and there were often times when the an
swer we were expecti
ng was not one that the 
expert was comfortable with, a
nd there was a dynami c, and h-
here the historian played a 
signifi cant role, often in the even
ing before trial, and in the ev
enings between the -- betwe -- 
between testimony of the expert
 witness in finding a common ground where the prosecution and 
the expert witness could both be 
comfortable with what the expe
rt witness was saying, because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
67 
 
there would be disputes and th
e expert witness was truly an 
independent witness and if he 
wouldn™t say what the lawyer expected him to
 say, that was a problem. And none of the OSI 
attorneys wanted to be accused 
of coaching a witness to say some
thing that wasn™t true. And the 
staff historian often played a role, using his 
or her knowledge of the documentation at finding 
some thing that both expert witness and prosecu
ting attorney could f
eel comfortable with. 
Q: Right. So of course, the attorney
 doesn™t want to be surprised at 
trial. You need to have a real 
sense of what™s going to happen. 
A: Absolutely, absolutely, and there is also a pr
ocess of preparing the ex
pert witness for cross 
examine questions -- cross examination questions
 that he mi ght get, and they -- the whole 
process of prepping for that. But this is some
thing that™s not unusual and happens in all 
proceedings and the defense does it
 with their witnesses as well. 

Q: Right. Not -- not that I™m going to ask you to na
me  na me s , I™d never ask you to do that, but I 
would imagine you folks had favorite expert witn
esses, and people you said we™re not going to 
use this person again, or this is -- were there 
qualities that you needed in an expert witness 
besides his expert -- or her -- not that you had 
any, but in this case, ma les, their expert -- 
knowing some thing doesn™t mean they w
ill be effective in the courtroom.  
A: Yes, th-the expert had to be comf ortable enou
gh with the material to be able to speak, offer 
his opinions with confidence. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And -- and in a sense that™s 
really what it was, it was an is
sue -- the expert had to be an 
expert, had to be comfortable enough with the data
 to be able to get up there and speak with 
confidence. And you can™t just, in my experience -- 
and I worked well with all of the experts that 
I worked with, the one I worked 
with most often was a gentlema
n na me d Charlie Si dmore, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
68 
 
worked with him in the Hajda case, as you saw from the transcript. But it -- it had to -- there had 
to be enough knowledge, enough familiarity with the ma terial on the pa rt of the expert, which 

meant the expert really had to do some  work, a
nd independent work, so that he could get up on 
the stand and feel really
 comfortable about what
 he was saying and even if he did ma ke a 
mi stake, which we™re all huma n and we do ma ke a mi
stake, that we could ma ke sure that it was 
cleared up on a follow-up question, or on redirect 
examination, if the mi stake was ma de on cross 
examination. Cause the -- the -- the nature of th
ese cases, and the level at which the infor mation 
was relevant -- most historians deal with the 
upper levels of an agency, and where we were 
dealing with people on the ground th
at are -- is generally not of 
much historical -- broader 
historical significance, given the 
complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or 
that, or the other thing, and a fo
llow-up question was often all one n
eeded to trigger off what the 
expert already knew. 

Q: I™m interested to hear what happens to you 
when you™re an expert witness, and I™m wondering 
if you can comment on this. Most people you have as
 expert witnesses are 
academics, I imagine, 
of -- of some kind. Am I  right? 

A: All have an academic background. 

Q: Academi c  background. 

A: All are trained as academi cs. 
We  had at least one expert witn
ess who was not -- did not hold a 
university position in the most recent 10 years of 
his career, but he continued to be academically 
active. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
69 
 
A: In other words, they were all experts in the 
sense that they continued to work with primary 
source documents, they continued to write histor
y, they continued to analyze docume ntation, and 
they kept up on the latest research in 
the fi eld in which th
ey were expert.  
Q: Is it uncomfortable in some ways for academics to do it in a court setting, because ambiguity 
is not what you™re looking for, you™re loo -- you
™re looking for a very specific kind of clarity. 
Now maybe it™s my bias, because I was a philosopher,
 being -- living with ambiguity is sort of 
the rule, and ma ybe as an historian 
that™s not quite 
as true, but -- 
A: I -- I think -- i-it™s been my experience, at  
least from what I™ve observed with experts on the 
stand, that there are times when the moo -- th-the ru
les of the courtroom, as to what gets in, what 
-- what -- what doesn™t get in, can 
be frustrating to the effort to 
explain the context of a situation. 
But I noticed in -- and I™m thinking of at least tw
o or three expert witnesses, who were able to 
overcome quickly, that discomfort and wo
rk with the rules of -- of evidence. 
Q: Okay. 
A: And in a sense, i-it just requires you to know
 your ma terial very, very well. To get a sense of 
the dynami c of the questioning. To not be flustere
d by interruptions by the defense, because the 
defense attorney™s job is to try to disrupt as mu
ch as possible, the train of thought of the expert, 
and to try to -- even the most d
ecent of defense attorneys -- to try 
to catch the expert witnesses -- 
witness, in errors of fact or
 interpretation that would serv
e to undermine his whole testimony. 
And those experts who accepted that, were co
mpe t ent enough in their material not to get 
flustered by those interruptions 
and kept going back and kept 
listening to, and following the 
direction of the questions, us
ually got most of what the 
-- they intended to say, out. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
70 
 
A: And in -- in -- in that sense,
 the expert testimony, ta
ken together with the trial record offered a 
fairly good picture of the history 
of this particular defendant.  
Q: Now wha t  about the use of survivor tes
timonies, or I don™t know 
how you call them, other 
kinds of witnesses, they™re not considered e
xpert witnesses, but experi ential witnesses. 
A: Eyewitnesses, in a sense. 
Q: Eyewitness, yeah. 

A: W- We use two types -- actually three types 
of eyewitnesses. There were two -- there was a 
traditiona l type of eyewitness, whether it was 
a survivor, or  a fellow perpetrator who actually 
saw specific events at hand. We  al
so used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who ma y not 
have probably i-in ma ny cases, most cases, di
dn™t know the defendant, had no idea what the 
defendant did, but could talk in 
general about what his or her pe
rception of what the guards were 
doing was, and also more important, what life 
was like. There™s no one, no book, no perpetrator 

testimony, no historian can possibly 
get across with the same  intensity
 as a survivor talking, what 
it felt like to the survivor. And it -- when the survivor
 talks, in that sense,
 if one ac-accepts the 
testimony as being no more than what it is, that su
rvivor™s memory, some of the inaccuracies that 
inevitably come  up in huma n me mo ry, even when 
they can™t be reconciled with an explanation, 
still don™t detract from the imag
e of what life was like in a co
ncentration camp, or in a line 
waiting to be shot at a pit. That this is so
me thing that -- this ki
nd of testimony lends an 
immediacy that the dry documentation just can™t 
give. But it also is 
less immu -- less vulnerable 
to attack than testimony, I saw him do it, becaus
e that raises all sorts 
of questions of how the 
witness knew who he was. And remember, he wa
s most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and 
looked pretty much like the next him and the ne
xt him after that. And how does this witness 
reme mber this particular person as opposed to 
anyone else? And in a tr
ial with a dynami c where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
71 
 
the defense attorney has the opportu
nity and must have the opportuni
ty to question that witness™s 
me mory, to try to trip that witness, to try to 
ask questions, well isn™t it po
ssible that you could be 
mi staken?  How do you really know that it was this 
person and not some one else? And in that ki -
- type of dynami c, that kind of testimony, unless 
there was so me  reason for the survivor witness 
to have known the ma n, the way you would -- th
e way you would judge the credibility of any 
eyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitn
esses -- the survivor testimony was often much 
more effective to give a picture 
of the climate of pers
ecution, to offer evidenceas to the identity 
of the people who are being persec
uted through their own persons. Th
is was stuff that they knew. 
This was stuff that they would not be mi staken 
about and could not be mi staken about. Then we 
had a third type of witness, we had to devel
op how the process of certifying refugees, and how 
the refugees applied for visas, we had to establ
ish that particular process. And we did that by 
locating individuals who had actually worked on 
those processes. In other words, displaced 
persons -- officials from the displaced pe
rsons commission. Officials from the counter-
intelligence corps, state department visa offi cials.
 In -- in --  I -- I can™t  reme mber a single case 
frankly, where any one of these officials reme mbe r
ed the specific case that they were asked to 
testify. We ll, after all, du
ring the DP act there were 
400,000 visas. That meant 400,000 
investigations and 400,000 pre-appl
ication interviews. And no reas
onable individual could be 
expected to reme mber one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn™t a -- a 

specific hooker about that -- that
 case. But what we could ask 
them about was what was the 
regular procedure?  Did you swear it
 was -- was -- was the applicant 
required to swear to the truth 
of what he was saying?  What did 
the applicant need in order to b
ecome  eligible to be a displaced 
person, to receive a visa? What were the exclus
ionary measures?  How were they implemented?  
And in that way, the witness could take -- o
ffer the judge testimony on how things actually 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
72 
 
worked. And we used those witnesses -- th
e OSI used those witnesses to introduce 
documentation regulations of the international 
refugee organization, re
gulations of the d -- 
Displaced Pe rsons Commission. Visa regulations, a
dvisory reports and what have you, that were 
releva nt to the process of how a displaced person
 entered the United States and what infor mation 
he was required to offer about his person 
in order to complete his application. 
Q: Right. We™re not -- it™s Hajda, right? 
A: Hajda, yeah. 

Q: Hajda. In the Hajda case you had two surv
ivors from Treblinka, 
who interestingly enough 
could me ntion the name s of two other guards, 
but of course did not know -- Hajda was -- was 
interesting, and th-the emphasis on the testimony 
was apparently not very much. There was an 
argument about inclusion of the testimony and the j
udge agreed to include 
it, but then didn™t use 
it very much in the final decision. And so, was it to 
give it a -- a taste of what this place was like, 
so that one could ma ke a connection between wh
at Hajda must have been doing, had he been 
there? 

A: I -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear th
at. And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of 
those witness -- they coul dn™t 
say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as  I 
reme mber. They -- they -- even
 though it was a small ca mp, th
ere were only roughly a hundred, 
120 guards there at any one time. I-In that pa
rticular camp, t he -- the commandant was a 
psychopath who often personally took pleasure in 
torturing individual prisoners, so he was a 
person who was fairly well known, even by name , to the prisoners of the camp. It was a small 

prison camp too, there were under a thousand peop
le in the camp, under a thousand Jews. And 
there was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, 
who had the bad luck to have a patch over his 
eye. And so he was reme mbered, not necessarily 
by name , but they all reme mbered the one with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
73 
 
the patch over his eye, and that™s
 natural. And in fact, the one w
ith the patch over his eye, bad as 
he was, often got blamed for virtually everythi ng
 because a -- a -- a -- a 
survivor witness, in 
reme mbering bad things that happened also reme
mbered the guy with the patch over his eye, and 
that the guy with the patch over his eye was a 
bad guy, and so the connection was ma de. And in 
ma ny cases they were right, and in some  cases 
they weren™t right. But Hajda was just one guard 
among many and it -- in -- in that 
case it was very typical of the 
survivor™s relationship to the 
normal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- th
e norma l guard, that he was a person in a 
uniform, tha t  unless there was some  reason to know
 hi m on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked 
in a tailor shop and the guard commonly came to 
the tailor shop to get his boots fixed, there was 
some  relationship that was ongoing. But just a 
guard on the perime ter was some one that the 
witness, after 40 years, couldn™t 
be  expected -- it w
ouldn™t be fair to burden the witness with 
trying to reme mber that particular person. And so in
 this particular case it was ma de easy for us 
because the defendant stipulated to all of
 the horrors in the Treblinka one camp. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: He stipulated to that, he said, okay I can se
e all of that. The issue was, was Bronislaw Hajda 
the person who was listed as Bronislaw Hajda in 
the -- in the documentati
on. And this is why the 
judge was so concerned about th
e prosecution™s efforts to document exactly what happened to 
each person who was on those two and -- and -- a
nd later three and four when you take Battalion 
Streibel into the process, roster s to document th
eir whereabouts, to convince as in this case the 
OSI did, to convince the judge that
 the information ab -- of the -- 
i -- contained in these rosters, 
the personal data and the information as to wh
ere these people were, was 
accurate, and did refer 
to these particular people. And the judge was convinced of that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
74 
 
Q: Do you ever reme mb er a case where an ey
ewitness, who was a survivor, who was at the 
place, was actually able to identify a particular
 person and be accepted for that, not because it 
was a vague reme mbrance, but was there ever an
 instance where that was the case, th-that it 
worked, people -- 

A: There was one case that I was on, the Bruno 
Blach case, where I was personally convinced 
that the survivor knew -- identifi
ed correctly, the individual as 
a guard. I was never quite certain 
that he correctly identified the indi vidual 
as the person who committe
d a killing, which he did 
identify. But the reasons that hi s particular rec
ognition of this person stru
ck me  as viable, and I 
saw him -- I saw him look at the photo spread, 
and in fact was -- when -- when the person was 
extradited to We st Germa
ny, the defe ndant was extr
adited to We st Germany, 
I had to testify as a 
witness, an eyewitness to that 
identification process. There wa
s no question that the face, the 
likeness of that picture registered
 with the -- with the witness in that  case, in my mi nd. I was 
watching him when he looked at the photo spre
ad, and I knew which photo was the defendant. 
And I was not asking the questions, an investig
ator was asking the questions, I was watching. 
And I saw him -- I -- I saw him when he hit that 
particular photo, flinch. And this was a very 
small camp, it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, about 2000 prisoners, ma ybe a hundred guards 

and a small squad of guards with canines, about 15
 of them. And this was one of the guys with a 
canine. He was a Sudaten German, and he also 
had a particularly handsome face. He was -- he 
was just striking looking. He was some one thatone mi ght reme mber in the context of a s mall 

group of people in a small camp, whe r e the indi
vidual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was 
there for two years, both in -- bo
th prisoner and guard were there 
for two years. The prisoners all 
worked in one factory, the guards all escorted them
 every day to that one factory. I don™t know to 
this day whether the identificati
on of this person as the killer in
 this case, was accurate. I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
75 
 
know to this day. Under interrogation later in the We st Germ
an proceeding against this 
individual, the evidence became so contradi ctor y, ev
en as to the identity 
of the victim of that 
shooting, that the defendant was ultima tely acquitt
ed in a criminal trial of the specific murder. 
But there™s no question in my mi
nd that that face was known to the witness. But that was the 
only case that I worked on in which I was convin
ced completely that an eyewitness recognized 
the defendant. 

Q: Mm-hm. I think we™re going to take a break 
and then go through what you consider to be the 
most important pieces of these case
s that we™ve been me ntioning, okay? 
A: Sure. 

Q: All right, you can stop now. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
76 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay. Peter, I wa -- ga -- I -- I want to have 
us have some  discussion 
about these four trials 
that we said we would talk about. But before we
 do that I wanted to as
k you a question about the 
denaturalization process. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Is the denaturalization process answering a ques
tion, is this person of moral character? And is 
the lack of moral character ba sed on the fact th
at there was a material mi srepresent ation in the 
denaturalization process -- or the 
naturalization pr ocess?  Is that 
where it comes from, or is it a 
judgment of who they were during the war?   

A: No, it™s the -- the bad moral ch
aracter is a judgme nt based on 
the ma terial mi srepresentation. 
That because  one lied, the violation is that one ma
de false st atements to obtain a federal benefit -
- 

Q: Okay. 
A: -- which citizenship is. And that that indi cated
 that this wa s a person of bad moral character. 
But the false statements, again, had to be ma terial. 
Q: Right. 

A: And in these specific cases, they ha d to cons
 -- they had to relate to information concealed 
that could have or would have led to
 -- led to the uncovery of persecution.  
Q: Now this -- this I know is a hypothetical quest
ion because I™m not sure it ever -- it ever 
happened, but I™m wondering what you -- you thi
nk mi ght happen in a case like this. Suppose 
somebody was in some sense a war criminal. They 
were me mbers of these organizations which if 
they identified themselves as part  of them, would have denied them citizenship. So let™s say they 

did come  under false pretenses, and you find this
 out, and you start a complaint, and what the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
77 
 
person does is confess, but also 
talk about how they hated what 
they did, or they changed their 
what -- that they -- they™re a di
fferent person. Is there ever -- 
could there ever be an instance 
where some body could be considered 
-- I don™t know, do I say become s -- 
A: Refor me d? 

Q: -- reformed? Would that matter, or  if someone tried to beco me -- admitted who they were 

honestly, and said, but I renounce that. Th
ey say it honestly to the people who -- 
A: Now if it -- ther e™ s really two questions. If
 someone is at -- a
nd i -- this goes for any 
immi grant, there™s -- ther e™s nothing special  about th
e Nazi cases in this. If some one admits to an 
activity or  an affiliation that would make that pe
rson ineligible to enter the United Stat es, and if 
it was a long time ago, or if the person could conv
ince the -- the consular o
fficial that he or she 
did in fact renounce that, there™s obviously discre
tion. There™s -- there™s di
s -- there™s discretion 
to permit, to give a visa anywa
y, the -- each official has discre
tion. Now, if the person lied and 
got in on the basis of concealing the infor mation, 
the theory as I understa
nd it, and it™s probably 
best to ask the attorneys when you do interview 
them, the theory as I understand it is that 
because you lied, in theory if we prove that you 
lied, your status goes back to where you were 
before you obtained the visa, which is as an al
ien about which we can then determine whether 
you are eligible to enter the United States. Now,
 the burden of proof is on the government once 
you™re here. In other words, the OSI always 
had the burden of proof 
in its cases against 
individuals who are here. But if 
you™re an alien seeking entry in
to the United States, the burden 
of proof that you™re eligible is
 upon the alien. So the alien mu st 
convince and demonstrate to the 
immi gration official, and to the cons ular official, that he is a pers
on, or she is a person eligible to 
enter the United States. We™ve 
never had to my knowledge, and I can -- I™ve never had a case 
that I worked on where individuals -- I should ma
ybe strike that, there 
was one individual who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
78 
 
confessed and said that he was 
sorry, but I couldn™t be sure th
at he wasn™t just saying that 
because now he was caught, and that this was an effort to sort of get some  mitigating 
circumstance. I™ve never had a situation here in th
e United States where we  ran into an individual 
who was torn up about what he had done becau
se of what it was that he had done -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- not because of the situation he found hims
elf vis-à-vis the immi gration authorities. May 
have played a role, but we have not had peopl
e actually come  in without us finding them to 
confess and say that they wish they hadn't done it. 

Q: Is -- was -- 

A: So it™s hard to separate -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- the confession from the circumstance in whic
h the defendant or subject finds hims elf. Been 

through some rocky time s, and there have been 
so me  instances where the fa milies of defendants 
had no idea, had no clue what the father had don
e, or had been during the second World Wa r. 

And this is certainly a hard thing for the fa milies to
 suddenly ha ve to deal with this, and they deal 
with it -- and they™ve dealt with it,
 at least as far as I™ve seen, in
 very different -- in different 
ways, from outright aggression ag
ainst the gover nment to really 
despair over who they are and 
where they came  from. But no, we™ve never had a 
situation where we could be sure -- where I 
could be sure, I can only speak for myself, that
 the remorse was unconnected to the situation of 
having been caught in the lie. 

Q: I hadn™t thought about the families, now that 
you me ntion it. In most cases, would you say 
that the fami lies resent the governme nt and are 
angry at the governme nt
 and don™t believe the 
government? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
79 
 
A: In some cases. 
Q: Some cases. 

A: I-I think it varies. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think it varies. What -- what I was saying wa
s that in some cases the children and -- and 
possibly even the spouse, particularly if the subj
ect met the spouse after th
e war, or met her here 
in the United States, they have no clue that
 subject X -- that husb
and and father X was a 
concentration camp guard, or was a shooter in a -- in
 a police squad in the eas
t. And it™s got to be 
shocking information if you had no idea before that. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: There are some  cases where the spouse at l
east knows, or suspects, and perhaps there are 
some  cases where the children know to a c -- to 
a certain degree, but I have seen cases where 
they didn™t. And that this
 was a complete surprise . 
Q: And th -- and you™ve seen cas
es where the -- the children or 
the spouse had to separate out 
themselves fr om the father, that  --  that this was so awful that they couldn™t  -- or  were they 

always filled with ambivalence because -- 

A: That -- that™s pr etty hard to determine -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because the only time that we -- we the histor
ians, at  any rate, saw the fa milies, if at all, 
was at the pre -- in -- pr e- filing interview, if 
there was one. At the post-filing deposition, where 
the testimony of the defendant is
 -- is obtained on th
e record, or some time s at trial, but 
some ti me s not. So often we -- if -- if a spouse 
or a son, wa -- who would now be grown, was -- 
was present, we™d some t i me s see the reaction of th
e spouse or the son to what they were hearing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
80 
 
And sometimes it was -- seemed apparent, or some
times it seemed likely that they were hearing 
this for the first time. But it™s 
hard to know what would happen, at 
least in my ey -- since I didn™t 
follow the families in ma ny of the -- these cases, it™s hard to know what their ultimate -- what the 

ultimate affect of this case was on the fa mily life.  

Q: In most of the cases, if not all of the cases 
that you were a part of, si
nce people were here in 
this country for a number of years before you ma de
 a complaint against them, were most of them 
living honest, upright lives?  Not me mbers of
 racist groups, or 
neo-Nazi groups, or -- 
A: Most of them were living fairly ordinary mi
ddle class, or lower mi ddle class lives. There were 
a few that had ma de it quite well, and there were a 
fe w that were sort of on the ma rgins. But with 
rare exceptions, they were not, as suc
h, lawbreakers, in the United States. 
Q: And -- and did you -- do you folks working at OSI 
sort of have little question ma rks in your 
head?  I mean, what does this -- what does this 
mean about that particular era?  These people 
come and they radically -- they become -- I 
don™t want to say norma l citizens, cause I don™t 
know what in heaven™s name  that really means,
 but they™re not crimin
als any more. And they 
live a life that is not a bad life.  
A: We ll, that -- that™s an interest
ing question. The way I look at it is
 -- is another way, in that it™s 
important for all of us, I thi
nk, as ordinary, if that -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- is a me aningful word, as ordi
nary citizens of a society, that ther
e be at least the potential, if 
we do some thing like what was done during 
the second World Wa r, regardless of the 
circumstances in which the individual found hims
elf, whether he was compelled to do it, or 

whether he did it out of his own 
a -- a -- as a volunteer, that there 
be some  possibility of legal 
consequence for that, no ma tter how ma ny years go by, in
 terms of that type of
 crime, I -- I feel -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
81 
 
- in a recent news reports of the proceedings 
against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet, that this -- though
 there are legal problems at ev
ery stage, there™s serious legal 
problems, the idea that our world, as a world 
society now, is no longer prepared to sweep 
responsibility for crimes in an official position, where an official abuses the law and causes death 
and suffering to people in his care, or her care, if
 in the future, that -- that there shouldn™t be 
some , some where down the line, the possibility 
of legal consequence for that. So I™m quite 

comfortable with that  for these particular cr imes
. It doesn™t mean that I™m -- I™m a believer that 
people can™t -- that I believe that people can™t be
 re -- rehabilitated, but 
I do believe that people 
need to take responsibility for what they™ve done. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Even if it™s some thing that they were co
mpe lled to do. I guess the ideal for me personally, 
would be to get to a point where 
each one of us has a sense that
 there are certain things that 
we™re not going to do, that it -- 
it™s better to die than to do.  
Q: Right. 

A: And there was one statement, Soviet protoc
ol of a for mer Trawniki man, who ma de this 
statement, and regardless of what you mi ght say a
bout Soviet protocols, th
is clearly wasn™t -- it 
was so unusual that it clearly wasn™t canned. Th
e individual involved had 
been a Soviet soldier 
who was captured and was selected out of a S
oviet prisoner of war camp, where he probably 
would have starved had he not b
een selected for service at Traw
niki. And he stated, after having 
served as a Trawniki trained gua
rd -- and I can™t reme mber wher
e he served, he stated to his 
interrogator after the war, to his Soviet interr oga
tor, that it would have been better for me  had I 
died in that prison camp. And if we 
are at a stage where there are thi
ngs of that nature, that we as 
human beings will not do to other human beings
, even faced with death, dictat orships are going 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
82 
 
to have a hard time carrying out ma ss murders. A
nd one element of that is at least having some  
potential of legal consequence for pa
rticipation in that kind of crime. 
Q: Now, I know you™re not a psychiat
rist or a psychologist, 
but the other part of the question is -- 
and I -- y-you certainly don™t even have to try to
 answer it if it doesn™t ma ke sense, is how do 
people do that kind of thing, and then become
 a non-criminal, and -- do you -- do you know wha t  
I mean? It™s a 
-- it™s -- it -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- what -- what is it about what you see in thes
e people?  Is it just -- it
™s -- it™s opportunistic. I 
don™t mean that they took the opportunity -- or 
some  -- some  well ma y have, to do certain things, 
but it™s opportunistic within a cert
ain situation. It™s not opportunistic
, it™s not the best way to be 
in another situation, so they b
ecome  like everybody else. So it™s 
-- I-I -- I don™t -- I haven™t 
actually thought about this before 
reading all this stuff, but it™s 
curious to me , the sort of --  
A: I -- is the question you™re asking, how can 
some one who™s done some thing like this -- 
Q: Just -- 

A: -- just  turn it all off -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- and become a normal citizen
?  Obviously it™s different -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- for different people, but 
clearly this was an extraordin
ary time. And ma ny of those who 
participated in it as perp
etrators, as well as those who experien
ced it as victims, recognize that it 
was an extraordinary time in which things were
 done that you don™t norma lly do. Many of the 
perpetrators, certainly most of the perpetrators
 that were prosecuted by OSI were youngsters. 
Teenagers, or  late teens, early 20™s when this pr
ocess began for them. So it was, sadly, a part of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
83 
 
their ma turing process, and it wasn™t necessar
ily a part of their quote norma l unquote behavior. 
Once it was over, once there was no authority, no
 compuls -- no authority to encourage, or 
compulsion to compel to participate in those ac
ts, for many it was not that  hard to rationalize 
what had happened, and even to say, well from 
now on I™m going to be a good citizen. From now 
on -- even perhaps because of this past, I™m going 
to be very careful about the laws in my new 
country. For the perpetrators, in ma ny ways, 
those who came to the new world, they were 
starting, particularly the young ones, they were st
arting as mu ch of a new life, sadly, as the 
survivors, with much less right to do so. 
Q: Yeah, right. The tri -- trif -- Tr ifa case. 

A: Trifa, yeah.  

Q: Go back and forth in my pronunciations. That
 is a case about -- primarily about a propaganda, 
so what I™d like to do is see how 
we can contrast each of these f
our -- for what™s sort of at the 
center of the accusation to get a -- a se ns
e of the range of OSI [indecipherable] 
A: Well, I -- I -- I thought of these 
particular four cases, in fact th
ree are fairly similar. Schellong 
is a concentration camp guard at 
an officer level. Bartesch is a 
concentration camp guard at -- at 
the grunt level. 

Q: Right. 

A: And Hajda is also a concentration camp guard
 at the grunt level in a different system. 
Q: That™s true, right. 

A: When I chose those cases, the -- the thing they
 had in common, other than the fact that I was 
assigned to them, and they were meaningful to 
me because I was with ea
ch one of them, in a 
sense, from beginning -- well, Tr
ifa not quite, but from beginning 
to end, was that each in its 
own way reflected a rather unique 
feature of advancing the role of
 the historian, or advancing the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
84 
 
nature of the research that went into dev -- 
the development of these cases. Schellong wa s the 
first concentration camp case.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The -- that -- the first WV
HA concentration camp case -- 

Q: Really. 

A: -- that we had. We ™d had -- Federenko was a Tr
eblinka guard before that, we™d had -- I don™t 
think we™d had another concentration camp case 
before that. So the whole WVHA system, the 
whole concept of protective arrest, the camps in 
the era before the war, this was something that  
historically new ground had to be 
broken in terms of how we presen
ted that evidence. It was also 
my fi rst case, so it was the fi rst --  it was my 
learning process, and I worked together with two 
excellent attorneys, Joe Lynch and Janet DeCosta,
 who were very flexible about giving me  the 
autonomy to do what I felt needed to be done. It 
was an excellent working relationship, and I -- 

for me , it developed the model of the working relationship between the do -- two professions, 
which despite all the name s and epithets we call one
 another, look at evid
ence in not always so 
dissimilar wa ys. A-An-And certainly are capable a
nd have in ma ny cases, collaborated quite well 
in the presentation, not only of a good case, but 
of a fairly good histor
ical record as well. 
Q: How would you characterize that
 relationship, since it became  
a model  for you?  What -- what 
-- what ar e you -- 
A: The attorneys that I have worked with on 
cases, it™s a very good rela
tionship, it™s based on 
mutual respect, it™s based on a mutual understandi
ng of what each of us -- and -- and each of us 
as representatives of our profe
ssion, can contribute to the devel
opment of this case, and the p-
present -- an-and the suc
cessful presentation of the case befo
re a judge. And it™s a good dynami c, 
I think. It worked -- it -- it worked very, very we
ll from the first case, the Schellong case, to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
85 
 
last case I worked on, which was the Hajda case, ther
e were rarely -- I-I™m not
 -- that™s not to say 
that there we ren™t argume nts and -- and screami ng 
matches fr om time to time which were -- were 
-- were a pa rt of the workplace. 
Q: Right. 

A: But there was always a -- a mutual unders
tanding that we need
ed one another --  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- very much, in order to do what our common
 aim was, was to u-u- uncover the individual™s 
responsibility for the violation 
and to ma ke possible the appropr
iate adjudication of the case. 
And that was a common goal, and despite whatever
 conflicts there were, there was always that 
return to the cooperation, and in 
-- in my case, I -- I have to sa
y there were relatively fle -- few 
conflicts. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, that it -- it was a -- a normal and h
ealthy working relationship from -- for 20 years. 
Q: Wa s the Schellong case a difficult case? 

A: The Schellong case was actually 
a fairly simpl e  case. It was -- 
it™s -- it™s -- I 
think it, if I 
reme mber correctly, Schellong was identified as 
being in the United Stat
es in approximately 
March 1980, and he was removed from the Unite
d States in ™83 or ™84. That was after 
denaturalization, deport, and all th
e -- all the -- all the appeals pr
ocesses in between. Which is a 
relativel y short time. 

Q: Right. 

A: The trial was in the summer 
of 1981, it™s 18 months, which isn™
t -- it isn™t a very long time to 
put together a case. So the mechanics of the case --
 most of the ma terial was in the United States, 
some  of it was in the Federal Re
public of Ger many, but most of it was in the United States, easy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
86 
 
to get ahold of, easy to have certified, easy to 
have translated. What wa
s special about the case 
fr om my perspective, was the fact that  it was th
is learning process, of learning what was needed 
of me , as a historian, to ma ke this case go. And 
learning -- learning to un
derstand the perspective 
of the attorneys, to understand, at least in what
 they would call a mi ni ma
l way, how the rules of 
the courtroom affect the presentation of evidence
, and how to reconcile, as much as possible, the 
historical  record with the rules of evidence. A
nd I think where we were successful in doing that, 
we had not only winning cases, but 
cases that -- that offer someth
ing to history as well. With 
Trifa, I -- I me ntioned it earli
er, that -- that Trifa had special
 aspects to his defense which 
required a much broader and deeper analysis of ea
ch particular segment of
 that case, and they 
were broken down essentially into the 10 segmen
ts that you -- that you had to carry around and 
read over the last couple of weeks.  
Q: Right. 

A: With Bartesch, which we haven™t talked much about -- 
Q: Cou -- cou -- li -- be fore we 
get to Bartesch, I want to -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- ask you some thing about Schellong, because it was -- 

A: Sure. 

Q: -- interesting to me  in reading the judgme nt a
bout Schellong is that he 
was training people. He 
was -- 

A: Yes, at Dachau. 

Q: Dachau. And -- however, it was very clear in 
the judgment that there wa s no proof that he did 
anything to a prisoner, that he ha
d anything to do -- he was not pa
rt of the commandant™s staff, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
87 
 
and so I wonder -- suppose he had 
trained these people out
side of Dachau. Woul
d that have been 
as much of a problem? 
A: If the -- 

Q: I mean -- or more -- it wouldn™t create a -- 
a -- more of a problem in terms of making a 
complaint against hi m.  

A: If the purpose of the training was to train 
concentration camp guards,
 if the concentration 
camp guards are assisting in persecut
ion, certainly the person who trai
ns them is also assisting in 
persecution. It s -- would have been an issue if, as
 a practical ma tter -- that™s
 a -- that™s theory, as 
a practical ma tter, if he had been training them
 i n basic guard detail, where the guardi -- i-it 
could be guarding prisoners or gua
rding buildings at a site away from the concentration camp, 
that would have been a harder case to ma ke.  

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: The case that would have had to have been
 ma de would have been the case that he was 
training these me n to be concentration camp gua
rds, and this is what it means to be a 
concentration camp guard. And that would, in our
 estima tion when we brought the case, would 
constitute participation in persecu
tion, or assistance in persecution.  
Q: Who ra -- I™m now trying to reme mber, I don™t know whether you reme mber who r a ised the 

question of the fact that he neve
r -- there™s no evidence that he be
at a prisoner, or that he was 
actually having much to do with prisoners at
 all. Was it your side
, or was it that he 
[indecipherable] can™t reme mber? 

A: I can™t recall that. I suspect it 
was the defense at that point -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
88 
 
A: -- but it --  that  was really the issue to a ce
rtain degree, that was de
cided by the Supreme Court 
in Federenko, which was -- the Supreme Cour
t decision came down in 1980 in Federenko, which 
was right before the Schellong ca
se, that it didn™t matter whet
her Federenko personally beat, 
assaulted or -- or -- or hurt a 
prisoner in any way. Just the fact
 that he was guarding was -- 
Q: Wa s enough. 
A: -- constituted assistance in 
persecution, that a camp guard, a 
me mber of a camp guard unit, by 
doing his daily duties, wa s 
assisting in persecution.  
Q: Right. 

A: And that was the issue that was ultimately de
cided in Schellong, and that
 was the issue that -- 
that -- that form that pr -- precedent comes fr
om Federenko that formed the precedent for the e -- 
every subsequent case that involved a concentration camp. 

Q: Okay, let™s go to Bartesch. 

A: Bartesch was unique for me  in that it was 
the one case where there was credible evidence, 
perhaps not beyond a reasonable doubt evidence, 
but certainly clear a
nd convincing evidence 
that he, Martin Bartesch shot
 someone on whom a name could be pinned. And it was also 
interesting in how that evidence came up, 
and how it was found. We  had a series of 
concentration camp cases related to
 Mauthausen, and th -- and this
 is a -- a good example of how 
OSI operates. The Bruno Blach case, which 
I was assigned to, involved a sub-camp of 
Mauthausen, and that case was already under inves
tigation as early as 1980. 
In investigating that 
case during the mi d-80™s when I investigated it, 
I went to the National 
Archives, to look through 
each of the U.S. military trials of Ma uthaus
en pe rsonnel, that U.S. military personnel had 
conducted at the site of the Dachau concentra
tion camp, in the records of the Judge Advocate 
General. Here -- at that time  it 
was downtown here in -- well, no, 
I™m -- I™m sorry, at that time  it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
89 
 
was at Sootland, at the Sootland 
repository, now they™re up in Co
llege Park, Maryland. And in 
the process of looking through all of that stuff,
 Bruno Blach was never at the ma in camp except 
for one day, he was transferred right away to
 a sub-camp called Wi ener Neudorf. But in the 
process of identifying everyone 
whom I could, who went through the Mauthausen system, I 
gathered documentation from all of the Mautha
usen and sub-camp trials so that I could put 
together an effective report eventually on 
how a person like Bruno Blach would come from 
Dachau, where he was before, via Mauthausen 
to Wi ener Neudorf. Amon
g the records that I 
found and didn™t pay too much atte
ntion to at the time  was a -- oh, it must have been about a 
hundred, 120 page document called an unnatural 
death book, unnatürliches Todesfälle. U-Un -- 
c-cases of unnatural death. Which was a log kept by the authorities of the central camp of 
Mauthausen of all unnatural deaths that were un
planned unnatural. That 
didn™t mean that they 
weren™t planned, but it meant a 
-- a prisoner -- if some  guards 
were having fun, and pushed a 
prisoner towa rds the wire, the guard shot, he was 
dead. That was recorded. I found it useful, has -
- has name s of guards, I copied it, but filed it be
cause there we re -- I did actually do more than 

file it because there were a couple of cases of
 shootings in Wi ener Neudorf. Not by Br uno Blach, 
but by others and that™s evidence th
at if an expert witness wants to
 say prisoners were shot trying 
to escape at Wi ener Neudorf, a
nd the judge or the defense asks 
well, what do you base that on?  
What evidence?  And then you have this log. Here
 so and so was shot on such and such a day, 

and by the way by this ga -- by th
is particular guard. Not Bruno 
Blach, but we have records of 
this. Now as it turned out, dur
ing that search I also found a Nuremberg document, 2176 PS, 
which was a collection of records that Mauthausen
 camp prisoners secured from destruction after 
the war, upon liberation, and turned over to the U.
S. army investigator i
nvestigating crimes at 
Mauthausen from the day that the camp was 
liberated. He was a ma jor name d Eugene  Cohen, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
90 
 
who we actually found after the war 
and talked to after the war, 
although this case never went to 
trial, and so he -- therefore he 
was not a witness. But among t hese re
cords were a series of rosters 
of Mauthausen guards, both at the main camp a
nd at some  of the sub-camps. And those rosters 
contained birthdates and ranks, and 
even last known addresses, what address that they had before 
they came to Mauthausen, before they entered German service. And so 
-- a-and again in -- in 
accordance with standa rd operating procedure at OS
I we turned these over to the research and 
development departme nt, and they ran them th
rough the INS. And Martin Bartesch came  up 
along with three others as a hit. And we the
n, in going back -- I had the Mauthausen cases 
originally, in the mi d-80™s. In going back throug
h the documentation, I came  back to this book of 
unnatural cases of death, and st
arted reading each of the entr
ies. And sure enough, Bartesch, 
Martin was assigned as a guard who shot a French
 Jewish teenager on such and such a date, I 
think it was October 1943. Bartes
ch himself was a teenager at 
that time. Bartesch was born, I 
believe in Oc tober 1926. I think it was October of 
™26, and so he was not quite 17, or just turned 
17 when he shot a teenager, who I believe was 15 
or 16 or 17, about the same  age. And we also 
found another one of the cases, another one of th
e subjects who had come  up on the roster was 
also on the list as having shot another French
 Jew at around the same  tim
e. And in that other 
case, which was the case of Stefan Riley, that in
dividual actually confesse
d to having shot at a 
person whose name  he didn™t know, when confront
ed with that information. Both cases never 
went to trial because both individuals I believe 
-- Bartesch before -- Bartesch went without a 
lawyer, quickly. In fact, I think 
it was the same lawyer who later turned up in the Hajda case. 
Bartesch was also from Chicago, so the fact th
at this guy represented Bartesch, ma de him known 
to Hajda as well, later, I thi
nk. I don™t know -- I don™t 
know that for sure, but I do -- I do think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
91 
 
Collins was also Bart esch™s lawyer. Bartesch pl ed 
-- refused to talk to us, as was his ri ght as a 
citizen. And was protected from doing so by his 
attorney, and fled to Austria before -- 
Q: Before the denaturalization? 
A: -- I think even bef -- it™s conc
eivable that it was even before 
we filed, but it mi ght have been 
after we filed, just don™t reme mber
 any more. But he did flee to 
Austria, and I believe he was 
denaturalized after -- yes, he was a citizen. I be
lieve he was denaturalized after his departure. 
Riley, who was the other concentration camp gua rd,both each at different sub-camps, I believe -

- no, they both shot at Mauthausen, but they each
 went to different sub-
camps later. Riley went 
to Bavaria, where he was, as I understand it, br
iefly investigated by the 
Ba varian authorities. 
Q: And Bartesch?  What happened to him there? 

A: Bartesch, I don™t -- I think the Austrians -- I do
n™t really know. I think the Austrians did a pro 
for ma, opened a pro forma case, but Bartesch di
ed shortly after, even though he was still a 
relatively young ma n. Riley, I -- I 
-- is presumably dead by now, but at the last I heard he was 
still alive, which would be late 80™s.  

Q: And the Hajda case is an interest ing -- 

A: The Hajda case was si gnificant for me  for two 
reasons. Three reasons, r
eally. It was the first 
case that I as a histor ian with the attorney, the 
partner this time was someone I -- one of my very 
best and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, 
Ned Stuttman. This was the first case that we had 
actually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the 

Communist regime s in the S
oviet Union and eastern Europe. This case wa s built, not 
exclusively, but at least three-qu
arters -- 75 percent of the eviden
ce was evidence that was taken 
from witnesses, or found in docume ntation that
 had been held behind the Iron Curtain since 

1945. And it also represented our first, as an offi
ce, our first extensive 
use of post-war Soviet 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
92 
 
protocols, of witness interrogations, where we
 no longer had the witne
ss alive to be cross-
examined. And we used them very, very carefully 
in that we didn™t accept them all at face value. 
We were up front about our doubts about the co
nditions under which this testimony was taken. 
We were also up front about the 
possibility that Soviet investig
ators at that time  had specific 
information that was going into that protocol 
whether the witness said 
it or not. But we used 
them where the evidence contained in them wa
s consistent with documentation, whether it was 
testimony given in the we st, or captured German
 documentation, either captured by the western 
powers or by the Soviets, where the information wa
s consistent, we could re
gard this evidence in 
the protocols as cooperative evidence. In other word
s, it didn™t stand alone, but just because it 
was protocol s taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn™t mean necessarily that we 

as investigators could, a priori say this is all 
phony, this is all fake. We  had to look at that 
evidence the way any historian -- an
d here in a sense the lawyers we
nt the way of the historians, 
the way any historian looks at a
ny evidence, with no a priori pr ec
onceptions, a priori suspicions 
but testing those elements of th
e testimony that ma de good historic
al sense, and being aware of 
those eleme nts of the testimony which one shoul
d rightfully have doubts about. And I can give 
you an example. There we re statements of for m
er Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and 
there was a whole issue, as you pr
obably saw, about the spelling of
 Hajda, because the Polish -- 
the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there™s no H in
 Russian, and the interroga
tions were always in 
Russian. There™s no H. The Russians replace H 
with the Cyrillic equi valent of the -- 
Q: G. 

A: -- the English, or the Roma n G, a nd so it was 
always Gajda, and there 
were any variation of 
Gajda, it could be G-a-i-d-a. It 
could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be
 G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there 
was any number of variations of that. And then
 of course there were
 the obvio -- the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
93 
 
mi sspellings, and the mi stranslations, and the -- 
the mi sspellings in the translation. But there 
were certain testimonies that identifi ed Hajda 
as a Pole. Now the Russians -- the Sovi ets didn™t 
have Hajda. Hajda was in the United States, they
 didn™t have him. He wa
s only of interest to 
them in that he was a name , another identificatio
n. There™s no evidence that they even knew that 
he was in the United States, although the Soviet
s knew about ma ny of the émigrés who were in 
the United St ates. There was no interest becaus
e he was Polish, and because Poland was also a 
Communist country, that the Sovi
ets were interest ed in extraditing hi m. But there were some 

witnesses who testified that Hajda wa s a Pole, ev
en though most of the rest of the people -- a 
Pole was an anomaly a mong the Trawniki me n. Th
ere were very small Polish recruiting drives, 
and there were only two of them
 who ever served at Treblinka
 one, two Poles. And not every 
witness said Hajda was a Pole. If ever y witness 
had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have 

been suspicious. If every witness had gotten the 
first name  right, one would be suspicious. But 
some  of them got the first name , some  didn™
t. Some  got the wrong fi
rst name. Some  didn™t 
reme mber a first name at all, they just  reme
mbered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole. And in a 
group of a hundred guards, that is more credib le. On the other hand, you would get testimonies 

where the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking 
to identify what people 
were involved in the 
ma ssacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners wh
en the camp was evacuated in July 1944. And 
there you™d have a list of 40 na me s. So and so -- 
I know so and so participated in the murder of 
350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacu
ated. The next guy would -- the s -- the exact 
same  thing. The next guy would the exact same  
thing. And then you get Hajda™s name, the exact 
same  thing. As a historian, I tende
d to discount. Didn™t mean that 
Hajda didn™t part
icipate, but I 
discounted that evidence as some thing that Sovi
et interrogators were interested in getting it 
because of the r -- the repeated que
stion, it was just plugging a name  into this stateme nt, that they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
94 
 
wanted. It wa s the oddities, the things that were
 different, that could be
 corroborated by other 
evidence, and Hajda™s Polish origins were corro
borated by personnel documents, and his place of 
birth. That could be used in these statements. 
We , in prosecuting the case, never charged that 
Hajda personally participated in the killings. We
 did charge  that he was there at the time  the 
killings happened, and we did describe, as you rea
d, in -- in some  detail, what the guards, the 
hundred of them, you know, there were a hund
red, hundred and 10, were doing while these 
killings were taking place. So the judge had th
e data to ma ke a judgment that well, we don™t 
know what Hajda was doing, but we know he was 
participating in some  way, because guards 
weren™t sitting around. They were all doing one 
thing, either guarding the people who were 
guarding the perime ter of the camp while the people were being taken out 
to the woods in groups 
to be shot, guarding those who were left in the 
camp while the rest were being taken out to be 
shot, escorting groups to the camp, 
or actually shooting them. It wa
s one of those things, all the 
guards were involved in that because that™s wh
at they were doing on that da y. And that was 
based on the Soviet protocols, and the primary 
source documentation. And we were able to prove 
that Hajda was there because of a group of docum
ents from t he successor unit of the Trawniki 
training camp, the Battalion Streibel. There was 
a group of 20 me n, all still working with the 
commandant of Treblinka one, who as well was evacuated. Every one of those 20 me n were on 
rosters at Treblinka one. So it ma de no sense,
 it ma de no common sense, this was a common 

sense issue for Hajda not to have been there at 
the time of the killings, 
and still be on that post-
evacuation roster with 20 other me n who ar
e all at the camp throughout, from 1943 through its 
evacuation in 1944.  

Q: Now, his lawyer, Collins, if I reme mber correctly, was ma king a big deal that on the 

personnel [indecipherable] you don™t have a fingerprint and you don™t have a phot -- a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
95 
 
photograph, am I right?  And yet you have fingerpri
nts from almost all the other people. Wa s 
there some  significance to that or didn™t -- 
A: No, there -- this was a -- a pa
rticular problem, it was -- it wa
s an interesting case. It  was -- 
was one of the reasons why we had to go into 
such detail concerning the personnel data of each 
of the people on the two Treblinka rosters, the one from March 22
nd
 in which -- when Hajda was 
sent to Tr eblinka one, and the sort of inve
ntory roster of 1944, approxima tely March 30
th
 -- 30
th
, 
1944. Hajda™s personnel file was mi ssing. We  didn™t 
have his personnel file. When we finally -- 
when our investigator -- our hist
orical investigators, those who 
could read Russian, finally got 
access to the records of the Trawni
ki trained guards in the fede ral 
security -- the archive of this 
Federal Security Service of the Russian Federati
on in the early 90™s, they
 found the notes of the 
KGB investigator who saw that file, and the notes 
that he took were consis
tent with the type of 

information that was on other personnel files. So
 it was clear that there 
was a personnel file of 
Hajda. And later we were able to actually track 
where that file went. It went with a bunch of 
personnel files to Ukraine, which was part 
of the Soviet Union 
in 1949. And tragically, 
tragically, this was very fr ustrating. It was, 
a-according to the Ukrainian authorities, it was 
destroyed in the spring of 1992. Th
e case was filed in the summer of
 1992. So before we ma de a 
request of the Ukrainians, it was destroyed, as 
the Ukrainian says, part of a norma l documents 
destruction process. 

Q: One other interesting part of
 the -- the testimony and the -- th
e use of older testimony and the 
analysis of it was the testimony of the father and th
e sister in a -- in the co
llaboration trial. They 
were being tried for 
possible collaboration. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And the father was dead, and the sist
er was not dead at the time  of --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
96 
 
A: I can™t reme mber the sister --  
Q: Probably can™t reme mber, b -- 

A: -- yes, the sister was alive -- 

Q: -- but I think the father was dead. 

A: -- and we -- we had -- we br
ought the sister over to the Un
ited States and she gave a 
deposition at which I was present, before the trial. 

Q: And denied what she -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- had said before. 

A: Claimed that it was a -- claimed th
at it -- she was forced to say it. 
Q: Right. 

A: If I reme mber correctly. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But there was -- the fa ther™s testimony in its
elf wouldn™t have been enough. The father used 
language that -- well, I don™t reme mber exactly wh
at the father said, but the father™s knowledge 
was a little less direct. He  only said that his son 
was in service with the Germans, or it was some 
-- some thing vague like that, I can™t reme mber exac
tly what it was. The sister, if I reme mber 
correctly, used a ter -- the Ge
rman term Wachma nnschaft, wh
ich happened to be the term 
describing -- Wachma nnscha
ft  was so mething -- it was the term
 that described a part of the 
Battalion Streibel. And she used the term Wach
mannschaften in Jedrzejow. And Jedrzejow is 
city in central -- south central 
Poland, along the vistu -- Vistula 
River, where the Trawniki me n 
were evacuated in July 1944, in order to pr
ess gang forced Polish laborers into building 
fortifications along the vis -- Vi
stula. You -- you™ll reme mber fr
om your history that the Red 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
97 
 
Ar my was stopped on the Vistula in front of 
Wa rsaw, and all up and down the Vistula, the 
offense ran out of steam, and the next  offe
nsive didn™t come until January 1945. So these 
Trawniki men had, between July 1944, late July 
1944, and the mi ddle of January 1945, they were 
on the Vistul a River, supervising local forced labo
r, digging fortifications 
on the west side of the 
Vistula. She knew either -- and I can™t reme mber now, either she visited him or she got a letter 
from hi m that he was in the Wachma nnschaften 
in Jedrzejow. Now there was nothing that was 
particularly horrible about -- yeah, bad things ha
ppened there, but it wasn
™t like Treblinka. It 
wasn™t like Belzec, it wasn™t lik
e Trawniki. It was a later time that seemed to be no conceivable 
reason for Polish investigators in 1945 -- reme mber
, this was January ™45, this was before the 
Soviet offensive that liberated Je
drzejow. This family is in -- near Zakopane, on the other side of 
the Vistul a, they™re being in
terrogated, and here she is 
sayi ng that he is in the 
Wachma nnschaften in Jedrzejow. Now he was in a 
company, but the headquart
ers of the Streibel 
battalion was in fact at that time  in Jedrzejow. 
And that was convincing to
 me  as a historian, to 
the attorneys as prosecutors and ul
tima tely to the expert and to th
e judge, that in fact, Bronislaw 
Hajda was in the Streibel battalion, and gave a 
tremendous a mount of authenticity to our use of 
all of those rosters, because the 
Streibel bat -- if the Streibel 
battalion rosters, which contained 
similar information to the Treblinka roster s, 
were valid -- and -- an-a
nd not -- not only in the 
sense of authenticity, but in terms of the accu
racy of the information, the accuracy of the 
personnel data, and the accuracy of where these 
place -- where these units were stationed, that 
gave greater credibility, because of the name s on
 the Streibel battalion rost ers, to the na mes on 

the Treblinka rosters. And it gave an e -- extra ad
ded push of credibility to
 the paper. And that™s 
how paper and witness testimony can corroborat
e one another, whereas a reasonable person 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
98 
 
mi ght have questions about either one, but the 
exact fit, that just w
ouldn™t happen if you were 
forging. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: You couldn™t forge it that 
well. You could take a blank personnel form and forge some one™s 
name , birth data. That kind of document you coul
d forge very easily. As I said before, the 
Soviets never sent us one of those. They ma y ha
ve  ma de them but they never sent us one of 

those. And we tested plenty. But that kind of 
connection, that this wo
ma n, interrogated by Polish 
authorities in January 1945, while
 her brother, and the German
 authorities we
re still in 
Jedrzejow, that she would know Wa c h ma nnschaf
t in Jedrzejow in January 1945, that™s not 
some thing forgers hit -- at that time , could ha
ve created. Now, we tested that document, and 
found it to be a document that did 
-- our experts found it to be a 
document that did originate in 
1945, and from Polish authorities. 

Q: Now, I don™t reme mber whether it was in th
e judgment by the judge, or whether it was the -- 
the lawyer for OSI who was saying that one of th
e important things about her testimony then was 
that she was -- fi rst of all, it™s completely de-l
inked from what  happened later, and that she was 
in a very vulnerable position. And here she was 
admitting this piece of evidence, and that there 
was some -- there -- it -- it made it more convincing. 

A: Yeah, it™s what the lawyers cal
l a statement against interest. 
Q: Interest, right, right. 

A: That it wa s against her interest to admit to
 Polish Communist authorities in January 1945, that 
her brother was serving with the Germans. Give
n that s -- the suspected charges that were up 
against her and her family -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
99 
 
A: -- of collaboration. But even if
 -- even if the Polish authoritie
s had beaten the hell out of her 
to get that infor mation, there™s 
no way that they could have know
n in January 1945 that this was 
a Wachma nnschaft, that that™s wh
at the unit was called -- basi cally
 means guard unit, or that it 
was stationed in Jedrzejow. 
Q: Right. 

A: That couldn't be forged.  

Q: Peter, tell me  some thing. Wh
en you look back on your almost
 20 years, right?  18 years? 
A: 19 years, 19 years. 

Q: 19 years. 

A: Al most exactly. 

Q: I don™t wa nt to -- I don™t want to ask this quest
ion so all I get is a yes or no answer, I™m trying 
to make it a little more complicated, but do you have 
a -- a real sense of pride in having worked 

with OSI, that there™s a kind of
 service that you™ve done, as small as it mi ght be given all the 
people who ma y well have been criminals, that this is an important service to m- more than the 

Uni t e d St at es? 

A: Yes, I do take a -- a strong pr
ofessional and personal satisfacti
on in having worked at OSI. I 
learned a lot at OSI. I learned through, as I said
 when I -- at my good-bye 
dinner, and -- and there 
ma y have be en some  surprised to hear it, I said
 that working with the 
attorneys over that ma ny 
years had taught me  how to be a 
better historian. And certainly 
the need to prove things from 
scratch had taught me  how to question assumptions th
at we so easily take for granted, that ma y 
or ma y not be based on actual evidence. And to
 really look at the ev
idence, and draw one™s 
conclusion from the primary source evidence. To give you an example of that, it™s common 

knowledge -- and I put that in quotations, that th
e Nazis like to give th
eir auxiliaries alcohol 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
100 
 
before sending them out on a mi ssion. Everybody says
 that, and in fact, witnesses talk about 
auxiliaries being drunk while they
 were shooting. But, in all 
the hundreds of statements of 
Trawniki men that I read, and in all the documents
 of Trawniki -- relating to Trawniki trained 
guards, there™s nothing about issuin
g of alcohol rations prior to 
an operation. And in fact, when 
you think of it, it ma kes no sense. You don™t give
 me n whom you™re going to put rifl es in their 
hands, and whom you ma y not entirely trust, alcohol 
to drink, for fear of not
hing else that they™ll 
shoot each ot her, or they™ll shoot you instead 
of the people they™re supposed to shoot. But why 
were -- why did witne -- were w
itnesses wrong when they saw some  of t hem drunk?  No, not in 
the cases of the Trawniki  me n, because of 
during the shooting and during deportations, the 
Trawniki were constantly extorting on their own 
whatever valuables, whether it be cash or booze 
that the victims had. Some ti me s it was cash and they
 turned it into booze, so that some  of the 
auxiliaries did have booze, and did partake of boo
ze prior to a operation, and 
that™s -- so what the 
witnesses saw, what the survivors saw, what 
they perceived to have seen was not entirely 
inaccurate. But the assumption that was draw
n, that everybody just kind of believed, was 
inaccurate. 

Q: Right, right. We ™re going 
to have to take a break. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
101 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Peter, at the end of the last tape you we
re describing your sense of service to the OSI. 
A: Yes. Yeah, I wanted to continue i-in terms 
of professionally satisfying, it was professionally 
satisfying cause of reasons that I had discusse
d, in terms of learning how to become  a better 
historian, in terms of getting access 
to records that mi ght not have thought, or been able to get 
access to had I not been with the Justice Departme
nt. Becomi ng interested in areas such as the 
auxiliary police, and Poland, and 
the Trawniki trained guards that
 mi ght not have come  across 
my radar screen as serious inte
rests had I not been at OSI. Th
e a-ability to put these pi eces 
together in -- in original for mulations. Subj
ects that nobody ha d written about because there was 
no public evidence available for people to construc
t a thesis on. This was 
all professionally very 
satisfying as a historian, I thi
nk prepared me  in many ways, br
oadened me  in ma ny, ma ny ways, 
that made me perhaps better pra -- 
prepared to take over the position 
of the senior historian at the 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. Personally, I find it 
very satisfying because as a federal civil 
servant I felt that I was doing a service to the 
American people in the se
nse that, having grown 
up in the Vietnam generation, I was contributing 
to a process where indivi duals who committed 
crimes during wartime, with all the excuses th
at one has to commit ac
ts of atrocity during 
wartime, were being called to account, despite the 
fact that they were small fr y. Despite the fact 
that in some  cases they were compelled to be 
in the positions where they eventually co mmitted 
their crimes. Despite the fact 
that decades and decades had pa
ssed, and that there was some  
reason for them to feel that this
 would never come  back to haunt 
them. That this was a process, a 
judici al pr ocess, a fa ir process by which people who had committed crimes could be ca lled to 
account. And if there is a potential for that in 
the future, conceivably th
e perpetrators of the 
future mi ght stop to think twice 
before perpetrating crimes along th
e lines of these crimes that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
102 
 
were perpetrated during the second World Wa r. And 
if that potential of legal consequence even 
works to prevent one killing, I feel
 that it would be wo
rth that effort, both for the future in terms 
of prevention, and in terms of 
bringing closure to the past.  
Q: What are your feelings about this? Do you ha
ve -- do -- I know as an historian you -- you -- 
you keep away from that, but I 
can™t believe for a mi nute -- 
A: We ll, we have feelings. 
Q: -- that  there isn™ t some sens
e of -- I don™t kn
ow, ma ybe revenge is too 
much, but that a real 
feeling of relief when these peopl
e do get denaturalized and deporte
d and even more so if they 
are extradited, and they get put on 
trial, they get punished. After 
all, denaturaliz
ation, deportation 
is a certain form of punishme nt, but -- 

A: We ll, deportation, if -- particul
arly if you™re over 70 and you™ve
 been living in the same  place 
for 35 years, I wouldn™t underestimate that -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- the severity of that as a punishme nt. Cl
early, deportation -- denatu
ralization and deportation 
is -- is symbolic in comp arison to a pr ison sent en
ce, but it™s certainly much more effective that 
simply deciding well, too 
ma ny years have passed -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- we shouldn™t go back to these things. I feel, 
in a sense, that a certain degree of justice has 
been done, not only to the victims of
 these perpetrators, but also in
 the process of immi gration as 
an American , these people, by posing as displaced
 persons took a slot that mi ght have gone to a 
person who was really in need, who was not fleei
ng prosecution, as opposed to persecution -- or 
who was fleeing prosecution, excuse 
me , rather than persecution. And 
that this is some thing that 
if we are going to have the immi gration laws th
at we do, that we shouldn™t ma ke an exception, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
103 
 
lenient exception for Nazi offenders. There are so
me  of these people who were real small fries, 
and I -- I can™t say that I feel gl
ee that their lives in America ar
e destroyed by the processes that 
we institute against them. And fr ankly for thei
r families, particularly the families that knew 
nothing about what the defendant had done, this is 
-- this can be really tr
agic. On the other hand, 
I go back to the people -- if people are going to 
kill in a wartime situation, and they™r e going to 
kill illegally, at some point it™s very important 
for all of us who survive those things, and who 
mi ght have to undergo them in the future, that we
 know that that won™t ev
er go away, that there 
will be some  consequence for that action duri
ng the second World Wa r, that there will some  
consequence for those who commit c r imes during the Yugoslav civil war, that there will be some  

consequence for those who committed crimes in Rwanda. If that becomes a habit of political  

behavior, if that become s a habit 
of judicial behavior in the 21
st
 century, and prospects seem 
better than ever before, and if the proc -- if 
OSI™s success for 20 years, and for my colleagues 
who are still there, I hope anothe
r 10, this will be a wonderful 
service that we™ve done for the 
United States and for the world at large.  

Q: When you were working for -- when is the Calley
 trial, the ma -- the My Lai massacre?  Is that  
af -- 

A: ™71, I think was the arrest. 

Q: ™71. Earlier. 

A: I think the events happened in ™69. 

Q: I™m just wondering, when you think about would 
this country -- and I™m
 not putting it on this 
country, but that™s where we™re working at because
 -- would ha ve been as aggressive against its 
own citizens, you know, i-in the sense of its ow
n citizens having committed a crime, because the 
United States governme nt was doing certain things
, would be as aggressive this way?  How -- h-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
104 
 
how does a country look at itself and do these ki
nds of things? Most countries won™t. We only 
convicted Calley, he certainly wa
s the scapegoat for all sorts of
 people up and down the line who 
were advocating these kinds of ma
ssacres all over the pl ace, right? 
A: Well, it --  the --  the Calley cas
e clearly illustrates and refl ects
 very clearly the problems with 
a governme nt policing -- 
Q: Right. Itself. 

A: -- and adjudicating itself. A-And -- and that™s 
one thing, for all the criticism that the for mer 
West Germa n governme nt and the German govern
ment has gone through for the small number 
of defendants that had actually been charged a
nd convicted, and served real sentences as opposed 
to token sentences, it still rema ins the one c
ountry outside of the Soviet Union where ma ny 
people actually went to jail for the crimes they committed. 

Q: Right, right, right. 

A: And it™s -- Lieutenant Calley is
 clearly a reflection of how diffi
cult it is for a nation to police 
itself while it™s in the heat of the fray. It™s on
e thing to start to police oneself 40 years after the 
events, when the people who are responsible ar
e no longer in power, and 
maybe no longer alive. 
But it™s quite another to stop the pr ocess while it
 is happening. That being said, the fact that 
Calley was tried at all under those circum
stances is also a significant event. 
Q: Right. So let™s talk about truth, jus
tice -- truth and justice. Or truth -- 
A: Slash justice. 

Q: Slash justice, or dash justice, I don™t know
. Or -- when you think back about the Nuremberg 
trials, and the subsequent Nuremberg trials, the D
achau trials and all of the national trials that 
happened, and then you think about the numbers
 of people who committed crimes, most of 
whom were not indicted, but even the thousands
 who were indicted we
re never put to trial 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
105 
 
because there was not enough evidence even if you were convinced that they were trul y guilty. 
What does this mean about what justice does to 
the truth of the nature of war crimes, and the 
nature of war criminals and the ability to actua
lly convict -- have a legal process against them? 
A: I -- I -- I think that  efforts to
 represent a judicial process as 
a history of the events that are 
relevant to the crime is a mi stake, although it™s 
one commonly ma de. I certainly came to OSI, or 
the SLU at that time  with the exciteme nt of be
ing able to write histor
y and convey history to a 
broader public, to historians, but also to a br
oader public through the legal process, and I™ve 
come to realize that a legal proceeding is just  
that , it has a specific pur
pose, and that is to 
ascertain a vi olation or a crime,
 a civil case vi olation and criminal case a crime, to ascertain a 
defendant, to assign or determine what the responsi
bility of the defendant is, and to determine an 
appropriate punishme nt for the crime.
 I think as a result of that, 
or at least as a result of an 
investigation, a part of the hi
storical record, whether it™s th
rough witness test
imony, perpetrator 
or survivor, or through docume ntation that othe
rwise would not have been uncovered, or would 
not have been uncovered as quickly, can push forwar
d a broader but different
 process of trying to 
understand and analyze what happened. 
I think a trial deals with an i
ndividual, or in rare cases a 
small group of individuals, to determine their re
sponsibility for very specific events, and to 
understand a broader historical pr
ocess requires a different proce
ss. And to expect the justice 
system to fulfill that latter purpose, to understand
 why things happened on a deeper level, those 
who expect that are going to be disappointed 
by the judicial process be
cause they™re putting too 
much on it, that this is a subject of
 a broader and more intensive inquiry. 
Q: But suppose I would say to you, most of the 
guilty ne ver get tried, for-forgetting ma ybe in 
most crimes, but in this particular kind of cr
ime, in war crimes, they don™t get tried. So ho-how 
well can it function?  What does it -- what does it real
ly do? Does it really i
ssue fear in the next 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
106 
 
group of people?  We ™ve seen the Nuremberg trials and the -- the national trials. We  still have had 
Rwanda and Ca mbodia and Bosnia and Sierra 
Leone, and -- and on and on and on, it doesn™t -- 
so what -- 

A: There™s obviously no guarantee.
 I don™t think the argument that 
most of the guilty don™t get 
tried is any reason not to try 
the ones a-a-and obtain convictio
ns against the ones who you can 
try. Because one couldn™t try Al Capone for murder
, didn™t mean it was a bad thing to try him for 
tax evasion. And I think it™s very 
important to set a standard, a fa
ir standard for prosecuting, a-a-
and in this sense, war crimes like this -- or I ha
te to call the -- I -- I™ll 
call them Nazi offenses 
rather than war crimes, are not di
fferent from other criminal acts in
 terms  of the need to establish 
a consistent and fair process to try these indi
vi duals and judge them, and if found guilty, and the 
-- the innocent -- the -- the acquittals
 are as important as the guilty ve rdicts for the survival of the 
system and for an expectation that the system will be
 fair, that this is an important  process. It has 
already, to a certain degree, the idea of trying 
people for crimes committed in ot her countries, 
decades after the event, is catching on. Pinochet is
 -- is an example, it™s 
an interesting example. 
And again, if this becomes a habit of political 
behavior and a legal response to regime s that 
violate human rights, this mi ght ma ke the world 
a better place. And beca
use there™s no guarantee 
that the world will be a be
tter place, doesn™t mean th
at we shouldn™t st op trying.  
Q: And hence, are you in favor of 
an international criminal court,
 rather than having sp-sp-Spain 
and England saying, we™re going to
 -- your -- your -- we™re going to extradite you, whoever you 
are, whether it™s Pi nochet or it
™s some body else, that it -- 
A: It -- it would be great if there were an inte
rnational criminal court th
at could review all of 
these cases. I think when that fails, one should us
e the systems that one ha
s in process. It would 
have been great if the United 
States could have tried thes
e criminals as criminals -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
107 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- under criminal proceedings. But the chance
s, because of the way our Constitution is 

written, because of Constitutiona l precedent, be
cause of real concerns about expos facto 
prosecutions, about jurisdiction, the 
chances that a criminal trial of
 these individuals could have 
taken place in the United States ma y have ende
d up as an excuse for doing nothing. What was 
there was immi gration legislati
on, and a -- a -- a legal response to
 violations of i mmi gration 
legisl ation that did ultimately pr ovide a fr amework 
in which perpetrators of Nazi offe nses could 
be uncovered, tried in a process that allowed for 
extensive appeals, a- available to any immi grant 

and could ultimately have a process where they
 would be removed from the United States 
because as Nazi offenders, they were inelig
ible to enter at the time they entered. 
Q: Wou -- would you if you -- if you
 could advocate, would you advo
cate that the United States 
sign the international tribunal ag
reement that other countries have signed?  Would you think that 
that was -- or are you not sure? 
A: I™m not -- I -- I would prefer to have an inte
rnational criminal tribunal. I™m not sure at this 
point that such a one would be any freer of th
e international and political  pressures that a 
national tribunal is subj ect to. And I™m not certa
in as well that the pr ecedents are strong enough 
yet for an international cr iminal tribunal to 
really have teeth, the wa
y a national tribunal -- 
Pinochet will probabl y -- if he is ever punishe
d, will pr obably receive perhaps a more appropriate 
punishme nt in Chile, more than anywhere else. 
Q: We ll, but one is not in conflict with the ot
her because if the country wishes to prosecute 
someone like they™r e doing in Chile, then the intern
ational court would not come  into play. Isn™t 
-- isn™ t the idea if the nationa
l country is will to do it -- 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
108 
 
Q: -- then it™s hands off for the international tri 
-- in terms of what has been written so far. 
A: Yes, but keep in mi nd that 
the Chileans were not ready -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to enter this pr ocess until the Spaniards re
quested --  star ted the process by -- by using an 
established procedure, Spanish c
itizens were killed by Pinochet. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: The Spaniards -- if you interpre
t that law, i-if you interpret th
at yo-you -- that murder against 
one citizen, that a country has a righ
t to protect its 
own citizens -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- that a nation can try some one, e ven the head of
 a foreign state that kills its citizens illegally. 
Q: Right. 

A: And in a sense the Spaniards used what was 
existing legislation. Never 
been tried before, but 
it was existing criminal legislation to make an ex
tradition request that set off a chain of events 
that ultimately, without an internat
ional court, has led to an inve
stigation in Chile that mi ght -- 
mi ght end in an indictme nt. And even if Pinochet 
isn™t punished, in my mi nd the fact that there is 
such an investigation for these ev
ents, a generation later,
 is an important thing. It wouldn™t have 
happened a generation ago. 

Q: Okay, then I want to ask you, the -- the other 
side of the question. Some
 countries like South 
Africa have decided to have a 
truth and reconciliation commission, and I -- I am one of those 
people who think of apartheid as a form of genocid
e. It™s not physical genocide in the sense of 
the Nazis, but it -- it is a form of a murder of
 a cultural and psychologi
cal and -- and in some  
cases, real murder. But the country
 decided rather than
 going and setting up 
trials, that they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
109 
 
would ask people to talk the truth, and seek amne
sty if it wa -- and not everybody™s going to get 
it who is speaking the truth, if 
they don™t speak enough truth.  
A: Or if the truth they speak 
is the zi -- is just too -- 

Q: [indecipherable] is not -- is not
 -- right. Now it™s in-in- interesting thing to think about, does a 

justice system, a legal system give one truth in th
e same  way t hat a truth 
and recons -- and they 
don™t call it truth and justice, th
ey call it a trut h and reconcili
ation system commission, because 
they™re trying to do something more to the soci
ety than what a legal system can do. So what do 
you think about that? 

A: You know, I -- i -- i -- it™s not 
clear what the effects of the S
outh African experiment will be 
in terms of healing the society. 
It™s not clea r whether, for inst
ance, a truth and reconciliation 
process would heal those in Ar
gentina now, who are ca
lling for justice for their disappeared 
relatives 20 years after the event.
 On the other hand, given the pr
oblems that individual nations 
have had policing themselves, I wouldn™t exclude 
it as an alternative me thod of trying to bring 
some  closure where the society is not prepared
 to adjudicate it th
rough existing criminal 
procedures, or where the absence 
of existing criminal procedures
 to handle cases like that 
precludes efforts to actually ad
judicate or to prosecute wrongdoe
rs by their peers, who ma y have 
been thei r former allies or  compatriots. It™s an 
interesting experien -- experiment, and I think it™s 

too early to tell if -- I think we 
need -- we™re going to need anothe
r 10 or 20 years to see what the 
effects of it are, because if you keep in mi nd 
that not everybody who™s morally responsible is 
legally -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- responsible enoughto obtain a conviction. 

Q: Right.

A: Whereas the truth and reconcili
ation process mi ght offer the oppor
tunity to bring some  of the 
moral responsibility out into th
e open. Might. But it™s too early to
 -- I™d have to reserve judgment 
on that. I think it™s an inte
resting experien -- e-experime nt, partic
ular ly if a societ
y is not ready to 
hand down indictme nts. 
Q: What do you think the effect of the Nuremberg 
trials are?  We™re 55 years later. Do we know 
that? 

A: I think the effect of the Nuremberg trials 
has been positive, even 
55 years later, and I™m 
looking at two issues. Not only the post-Nuremberg
 Nazi offender trials, 
whatever country they 
mi ght be in, that st ill go to this day, and that wi
ll go until the last perpetra
tor dies. But also if you 
look at the Gulf War, it™s really
 difficult for a nation to attack
 its neighbor, and annex it any 

more, without provoking some  sort of international 
reaction. And I suspect th
at that -- the ability 
to actua lly fight a war, whether we agree with Am
erican intervention or not
, to reverse the Iraqi  
occupation and annexation of Kuwai t  was some th
ing that would not necessarily have been 
possible or easy prior to 1945. 

Q: But if there weren™t oil, would we
 have done it?  We  don™t do it in Africa. 
A: Has it --  has it -- 

Q: We  don™t do it in the Congo. 

A: Has it really happened where one c
ountry has simply annexed another? 
Q: Right. 

A: The way Iraq annexed Kuwait?  I mean, it™s true, 
the oil -- the oil heightened interest and atten 
-- and attention, there™s no question about that. 
But the response, the ca
pacity to respond as a 
United Nations, rather than just one country 
defending its interests, 
defending its economi c 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
111 
 
interests, the capacity to respond as a United Na
tions seemed much more difficult as it was, 
much more realizable than the League of Na
tions capacity to respond to Nazi aggression. 
Q: But Peter, let™s -- let™s go back to Bosnia for 
a mo me nt. Even if one doesn™t think that Bosnia 
declaring itse lf a state and croa
 -- Croatia declaring itself a state, the -- the western world, 
anyway, accepted their dec-declar
ation of independence. And then
 Milosevic and the Serbs, and 
the Bosni -- they attack. We don™t do anything for 
four years, four and a half years. Nothing. 
A: I think it -- 
Q: So the -- 

A: I think because this was the disintegration of a 
state in a civil war, the 
issues were much more 
murky than they were in the case of Iraq and Ku wait. I don™t think it was only oil. I think the 

international issue was much more murky, a
nd the United States and other powers were 
uncertain as to whether there was still a Yugosla
via or whether these new states emerging from 
the break-up of Yugoslavia were legitimate states. The first -- 
Q: But we accepted that, right? 
A: The fi rst nation to accept them -- 

Q: Germany . 

A: -- was Germany, but Germany ha d other 
than huma nitarian 
reasons to do that. 
Q: Well -- 

A: Germany was following a traditional pro-Croatian policy. 

Q: Right. 

A: And it™s -- it™s more similar to the response 
of had the British or the French recognized the 
confederate states of Am
erica, which after all, declared 
their independence of the union, and 
determined to defend itself -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
112 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- against the central governme nt that was s
eeking to essentially destroy that confederate 
nation and re unite it with the United States. Brit
ain and France -- the situation was at that time 
also very murky. But there was 
no Nuremberg at that time .  
Q: Right. But you know it better than I do, that the 
world we live in now is probably going to be 
very easy to declare that™s a civil war, that™s a 
ci vil war, that ™s a civil 
war. This is not like 
Kuwait, this is not like Germany marching into
 Poland. I want to say 
Austria. S -- and so 
consequently, the murkiness gets built into a deci
sion not to do anything. It
 helps -- it -- it helps 
to say it™s murky, when if you actually look at 
the situation, why shouldn™t one go into certain 
so-called civil wars?  Do you know what
 I mean?  I think if -- I think th
at the term is used as an -- 
as an excuse not to do some thing.  

A: I-I don™t think that Nuremberg, that the Nuremb
erg trials really provides much of a precedent 
of what to do with a nation that is breaking up. 
The nur -- the internati
onal military tribunal was 
established to deal with a nati
on that planned and conceived a
nd waged an aggressive war -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- against other nations. You™ve really got to 
look at this as -- as a 
progression. Prior to World 
War  
11
 ther e was no international apparatusto deal with that. After World War 
11
, with -- with all 
its ineffectiveness, we do 
now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one 
country attacks another. Now, the next step is wh
at do when a country disintegrates, or when one 
mi nority in a country starts butchering another 
mi nority in a country. That™s some thing that 

perhaps the development of an in
ternational cour t, and the devel 
-- certainly the development of 
more cohesive international react
ion. Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms 
of providing shelter for refugees, which is something we ought to have 
learned from the last 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409

world war. That all of these initiatives are going to
 have to come  into play in the future. Whether 
we™ll be able to prevent all kill
ings, we as huma n beings, I™m not 
talking about we as the United 
States, but we as citizens of th
e world, will be able to preven
t killings is some thing no one™s 
going to be able to guarantee. But to work 
towards mitigating killings, to work towards 
providing sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who mi ght be the vi ctims of killings, and that  
-- that is some thing that we certainly could have 
done more quickly in Rwanda at least, and quite 
probably in Yugoslavia as well. Bu
t there -- each s
ituation is different, and 
we, as citizens of the 
world again, not just we the United St ates, or we
 the west, we as citizens of the world are going 
to have to work towards strategies for dealing 
with internal disturbanc
es, internal  civil wars, 
internal persecution, in a wa
y that is effective.  
Q: I mean, when you mentioned Rwanda, that become
s even more complicated. It™s not just that 

there was a genocide in the country, then the ge
nocidiers leave and go to the Congo and become  
-- 
A: And spilled into another country. 
Q: -- helped by Novato, and then Rwanda suppor
ts Cabilla going in and then bi -- Cabilla 

become s who he is. And now you have incursions 
back and forth, so it™s no longer a so-called 
civil war. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And the world is not
 responding to stop it -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- it keeps tra -- it -- th
ere™s no teeth in the response. 
A: No, and the world is -- the -- there™s -- your --
 you™re absolutely right, a
nd that™s -- this -- this 
is a different situation that 
the Nuremberg Tribunal was neve
r set up to address. This is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0409  
114 
 
some thing that we now have to deal with in the 21
st
 century and we now have to develop a 
means of preventing, if possible, mi tigating if 
possible, and -- and ultimately adjudicating if 
possible, in a way that is credib
le to the -- the victims, and cred
ible i-if you understand what I 
mean, to the perpetrators as well. 
Q: Seems like there are too many victims and too many criminals. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes, there™s -- wit
hout question, that™s true. 
Q: So what would you like to say that you haven™t talked about, or -- 

A: Hm. I think in many ways, at the moment -- I™
ll probably think about and think of 10 things 
that I™d want to say, but I™m going 
to be around for awhile, so if -- 
if it come s again 
-- but at the 
mome nt I think we™ve covered -- 

Q: Okay. I really -- I thank you so much for be
ing so open and full with
 your responses. It™s 
really been a pleasure for me . 

A: We ll, it™s been a pleasure for me , and I hope that 
this -- this tape will be helpful in the future. 
Q: I™m sure it will. Thanks, Peter. 

A: Thank you, Joan.
