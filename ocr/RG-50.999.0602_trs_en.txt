Germ any invaded Poland on September

From  there,a young Soviet officer helped the Mennfam ily get a train to Vilnius where 
they lived in the ghetto for a year. In thefall of 1940, Julius'f ather, David, m anaged
 
to get 
four

>> Julius Menn:
 
Hello,ever ybody. I'm  very happy to be here to talk to you today. Can youhear 
m e ? 
 
>>
 
Ye s .
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Good. First of  all, I want tothank the sponsors of this program  andalso Bill for 
enabling m eto talk to you. I want to share with you m y experience in partas an accidental 
survi vor of  the Holocaust.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius,you want to make yourself comf ortable? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
B ill wil l a s k  me  qu e s t ion s  
an d
 
then I will answer.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius,you described your early years as a wonderf ul lif e.T ell usabout your 
fam ily and you in your life before youm oved to Palestine.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I was born inGdansk. Gdansk was a city, state, that was establishedby the 
Leagueof  Nations. Ithad a very liberal constitution. It was sem i
-
independent. Itsf oreign policy 
andArm y were Polish. Poland was defending it
 b
ut it really was Germ an.
 
 
My f ather was a very successf ul lumberm erchant. And he also, through this lumber 
business, metm y wif e
 
--
 
I m ean,m et m y mother. Herfather had afactory in Bialystok and big 
forests near Vilna, which now is the capital of Lithuania.T hat wholearea were thef orestswere 

is now Belarus, which is another country.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius, your f ather had served 
in the Russian Arm y. Is that right?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.My f ather was a soldier. He was born inKiev, which is now the capital 
of  t he
 
Ukraine. Hefought on the Austrianf ront.T he Russian Arm y was ver y poorly equipped, 
andhe lost histoeson one leg becauseof  the cold weather and inadequate clothing.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hy did he move f rom  Russia toPoland? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, he escaped
 
--
 
there was a lotof uncertainty in the Ukraine at that time. 
And rem em ber, the Soviets were taking it over. It was a very bad time. So he escaped to 

Poland. Poland was fightingf or its independence against Russia. He got af ictitiousbirth 

certif icatef rom af ictitious village that made him  10 years olderthis way he didn't have to serve 

in the PolishArm y. And he esca
ped to Gdansk.
 
As I said,m any Jewish intellectuals wentto 
Gdansk. Inf act, there were t wo Am bassadors inW ashingtonf rom  Israel. One of them was m y 

childhood playm ate. I forget his nam e. But anyhow.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius,in 1935, when you were 6, your fam ily then moved to Palestine.T ellus 
wh y your fam ily m oved to Palestine and tell us about your years inTel Avi v at that tim e.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.I'll sit down. I have a very bad leg. I'm almost 90 years old.
 
 
W hat was your question? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf am ily m ovedf rom Poland toPalestine when you were 6.T ell us about 
them ove, why they m oved to Palestine,andwhat it was like when you were there.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
He was a great Zionist. He alwa ys wanted to live in Palestine. So in
 
'35, we 
we n t, m
y m other,father, and little sisterandthe Germ an governess, who was Catholic, who 
was wil ling to go with us. It's very interesting. I really see her as m y alter m other.She taught 

m ea lotof  Catholic catechism that Iused to say at night bef oreI went to sleep. Unfortunately 

she went back with usto Poland
 
--
 
I'll come to that story

 a
ndduring the war 
she was killed in thebom bings in Berlin. 
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
: 
W henyou m oved toT el Aviv, you started school there.W hat was school like 
for you then inthose years?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell,we got to Tel Aviv, it was a very nice city of about a quarter m illion 
people. Forexam ple, it was ri ght on the Mediterranean Sea.It was on the sea. Even if  you 

were in thef irst grade,it was extrem ely saf e.So children could walk to the beach. Iused togo 

4 
 
to the beach when I was in f irst grade and take abath in theocean, in the Mediterranean,and 
then walk home. Burglaries were unknown. People wouldn't locktheir houses. It's certainly 

changed today b
ut in thosedays it was ver y nice.
 
 
W hen Ienrolled inf irstgrade, I didn't know any Hebrew. It was a Hebrew school.T he 
teacher was telling thekids
 
--
 
she was reading them " Robinson Crusoe" . Fortunately she 
spoke German. So I would ask her to translate 
f ormethe story, so she would. And within three 

m onths I learned Hebrew.W hen you're a child, it's easy to learn a language.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In1938, you hadbeen in Tel Avi v f or three years, but in1938
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, I was ver y happy li ving in
 
Tel Aviv. T he Germ an governess essentially 
took care of me. My parents traveleda lot. I was very happy with m y f riends and school.T ogo 

to Poland, it was a terrible idea.
 
 
You m ust project yourself 
--
 
I see we have a lot of students here. You must proje
ct  
yourself  when you were 10 years old.T hat'swhen I was forced to go toPoland. My m other 

wanted to visit her fam ily and m y father still had the business in the port city near Gdansk. So 

he wanted to sell it.That's why we went in 
`
38. Obviously it was the cloudsof  war were there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And when you went, it was intendedtobe just a short stay but itdidn't work  out 
that way.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yes, just f or the sum mer.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hy did you not com ebackat the end of summ er? 
 
>> J u l i u s  M e
nn:
 
My father had diff iculty selling andm y m otherf orgot about going back. She 
had sucha good timeat her mother's. My m other
,  
when we moved to Palestine in 
`
35, she 
was only 31 years old
, a
ndto live in Palestine where in Gdansk shehad servants andT el
 
A vi v 
she hadtodo everything by herself.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So she was enjoying being back in Poland. And your father was notableto sell 
the business.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.So we came back toWarsaw and Ihad toenroll in a Polish public 
school.I went one year to that schooland I had to learn Polish.
 
 
Now, you m ust imagine, especially the kids in the school
, s
uppose you had to m ove 
to, say, Mexico. You had to learn Spanish. You hadm aybea different religion, adiff erentwa y 

of  lif e . T h is  is  b a s ica lly wh
at I conf ronted inPoland.
 
All the Pols wereCatholic,but
 
--
 
there was 
no separationof  stateand religion like we have in the UnitedStates. In thef irst hour it was 

devotedto catechism . So those who were not Polish kidshad to leave the classroom and w
a it  
in the hallway. T hose ofus who were Jewish, this was f irst tim eI really learned about 

d is c rim in a t ion .
 
So thisyear passedand I learnedPolish.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius,in that time, you went there inthe sum mer of  
`
38, stayed more than a 
year. Now we're into the m iddleof  1939. Youm entioned there was threatsof  war.W ere your 

parents worried about war, to your knowledge? And was that
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
As a child, Idon't know. I was just angry that we didn't go back.T hat summer 
of  
`
39, I spent it at m ygrandm other's littleplace in the woods. She taught mehow to collect 
m ushroom s sonot tobe poisoned andberries. That was ver y enjoya ble. IplayedT arzan inthe 

forest.I had a little knife. It was very enjoyable sum mer, Im ust say.Unfortunately we
 
s t ill d id n ' t  
go back. 
 
 
W ell, Im u st sa y
 
--
 
I keepforgetting that that summ er we went to
 
--
 
thatm ap isn't here 
anym ore.W e went toa resort that was ver y close to East Germ any and very close to 

Bialystok. Bialystok wa s close to the Germ anborder.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:
 
So Septem ber
 
1,1939, Germ any invades
 
--
 

5 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I was in the summ er resort. Septem ber
 
1, the Germans attacked Poland. I 
rem em ber the Germ ans tookplanes, were diving down. T hey hadaspecial noisemaker.The
y 
were m achine gun
ning 
the peop
le .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you rem em ber thatpersonally?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yes.W e were able to escape toBialystok throughsom ef riends who hada 
car. They took us. My father was inW arsaw. Som y m other went toW arsaw.
 
 
It's interesting.W arsaw sur vi ved f ortwo wee ks being besieged by the Germans 
bef ore it collapsed. Som y m other was ver y lucky she foundm y father and they cam eout on 

oneof  the last trains back toBialystok. 
 
 
My f ather said we cannot stay here so hef ou
nd
 
--
 
now, remember, this was 1939, a 
long tim eago. Hefound m y late grandf ather's coachm an.And that coachm an cam e in the 

m orning. It musthavebeen the 3rd of Septem beror so. He cam ewith a buggy, just like the 

pioneers who went we st, that had straw in
 
it anda canvas top.W eclim bed into the buggy and 
we went intothe Polish forests.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And tell us about that trip. You spent two weeks tryi ng to go through thef ields 
and forests.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I spent two weeks in the forest.W hat saved u
s as we were traveling
 
--
 
it  
wasn't ver y f ar.W e wanted to goto Vilna. My m other thought that her m other would be there. 

Shehad ahouse there also.
 
 
T he two weeks you can ask whatdid you eatfor a week,f irst week.W eateapples. 
W e ate apples because P
olandhasa lot of apples andthere was nobody to pick them  
because the soldiers
 
--
 
I mean thef arm ers were in the Arm y. And the same thing, nobody to 
harvest the wheat, which was ver y tall.
 
T he roads weref illed with refugees who would also eat. 
Ever y tim e the stukasappeared, we would jum p into the wheatf ield and the tall wheat 

protected us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the stukas were theGerm an dive bom bers, right?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Dive bom bers, yeah.W e were lucky to com ebackto the cart. There were 
piecesof  humansandanimals, andblood allover and sm okef rom  cars, etc. It was terrible.
 
 
One of  the questions of ten I'm  asked is
 w
as I af raid
.  
W ell, I think asa 10
-
year
-
old, you 
can only be af raid
 
f ora few m inutes. You canbe af raid when the stuka was diving and 
m achine gunning the people. I was af raid, asI remember. But long
-
term fear is an anxiety t hat 
usually vis its people but not children.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soaf ter two weeks of  going through t
h at
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
T he second week we f ound farm s thathad a lot of eggs. So m y father bought 
theeggs. But we had to eat raw eggs.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soaf ter two weeks you m ade it to
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Only dogs can eat them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were f o
rced to eat them . But youm ade it to Molodeczno after two weeks. 
W hat happened onceyou got to Molodeczno? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Oh, when we got to Molodeczno, which was a railroad junction, the coachman 
said Ihave to gobackto Bialystok. So he leftus on the
 
platf orm andwe were standing there 
anddidn't know what to do. W e heardthis rum ble. And then prettysoon it became louder. And 

those tanks appeared. And we were convinced that they were German but they had the Soviet 

star, the red star.So we knew that nobody's going to kill us instantaneously.
 
 
T his Russian young officer came on the platf orm . He liked m y little sister. He would 
gi ve her chocolate bars. Then he askedm y father where we are going and we said
 
--
 
he said 

6 
 
we wanted to go to Vilna. T he officer said, "Are you Jewish?"  Andmy f ather said yes.And the 
off icer said, "I'm  Jewish also."  So he put us on am ilitary train. Molodeczno is not very f arfrom  

Vilna, m aybe 100
 
m i l es . W e c am e t o  V i l na
, w
hich is a rather large city. M y grandm other wasn't 
there
 
so we went to one of herfarm s in a village that was notfarf rom  Vilna.W e spent there
 
about two weeks.
 
 
My achievem ent as 
a 10
-
year
-
old was I
 
learned how to ride a cow.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I must tell you, it's very diff icult to ride a cow. 
 
 
Anyhow, we cam e back to Vilna. Ihad to go tof if th grade. I had to learn Lithuanian. 
Because Lithuaniaoccupied Vilna. It's a very strange language, a very dif ficult one.It's not 

s im ila r t o  Po lis h  at  a ll.
 
Also, Ihad to learnLithuanian history, which I still rem em ber some of it.
 
 
In them eantim e we lived ina terrible place
, i
n an all Jewish ghetto.My parents 
m anaged to rent a room  f rom  af am ily. At night the rats would come outthroughthe raf ters. 

T he Soviets who occupied
 
--
 
Idon't want to go into the history because it's very com plicated.
 
I went to this Jewish school.It was a public school
 c
alledT arbut.There were so m any Jews in 
Poland; there was anetwork of  schools.It was ver y interesting. It was a school where all the 

subjectsexcept the language of  the country,which was Lithuanian,andthe history, were 

taught in Hebrew. I liked the students very m uch.
 
 
My f atherhad basically nom oney. I would goaf ter school with one of the students to 
his hom e. His nam e was [Indiscernible]. Hisfather was a lawyer. So he was rather wealthy. He 

hada radio thathe could listen to the BBC. Ihad to go back to the ghetto and tellm y father the 

summ ary of  what the news were.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As you said, the conditions where you were living were really, really t
ough 
conditions. Youhad rats in there. Youtoldm e thatf ood was very m eager. And it was also 

terrif ically cold. You were ver y cold. It was a cold winter.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Oh, yeah. Vilna is very f arnorth and it's very cold in the winter. I didn't have 
an
y warm  clothes so my m otherused to rubm y legs with animalf at because otherwise I would 

f reeze. I had to walk half an hour tothe school.
 
 
Eventually
 
--
 
if  we hadm oney, we could fly toSweden. Andf rom Sweden we could go 
anyplace. Because Sweden was a neutral country. 
 

 
Actually, m y fatherf ound an oldf riend of his in the capital of Lithuania, which was 
Kaun
as at that tim e.This m an gave m yf ather about
 
$5,000.It was a lotof  money in those 
ye a rs .  Ce rt a in ly lik e
 
$50,000 today. So m yf ather was able to 
get for our f am ily transit visas to 
the Soviet Union. There were only 300 Jews who cam ethis way on a transit visa to the Soviet 

Union.
 
 
W hat I rem em ber m ight interest you.W e came to Moscow by train. It was the winter of  
1 9 40 ,  bef o r e t he  a
t
tack of  the Germanson the Soviets.T hey put usup in a hotel
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Julius,bef ore you go there, I just want to have you share onething that you 
toldm e.Because it was so cold in Vilna and you wore shortpants togo to school, tell us what 

your m other would do to keep you warm .
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Oh, I said. Yeah, she would put animal f at.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
She would coat you in anim al faton your legs to keep you warm
. G
oose fat, 
r i gh t ?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.It's interesting. TheSoviets, how they attracted children, especially. 
T hey showed m ovies outdoorsf ree.W e loved it.
 

7 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soasyou were starting to say, Julius, there were only 300 transit visas issued. 
Your fam ily got four of them . So you set out on a train trip through the Soviet Union to 
make 
your way to Palestine.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.Overnight in Kiev m y fatherhad half of hisf am ily that were still in Kiev 
buthedidn't wantto see them  because theSoviets would arrest him . In the Soviet Union
 
you 
couldn't have any contact with foreign
e rs .
 
 
So in Moscow, we wer e ata royal hotel, which had glorious days. This was like a 
Kaf ka.T here was a chandelier in the dining room. It was covered wi th cobwebs. There were 

satin curtains that were torn.T here were wait ers that had old tuxedos on.And 
in the dining 

room  we were only guests.W e saw the menu. It was abook but the waiter said, no,no, we 

don'thave any of these. W e just have stew.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sohegi ves you them enu with lotsof  item sbuthe says we only have stew.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Ye
ah.So after threedays we  continued. One of thewaiters said tom y father 
there won'tbe any food on the road becauseon the train they don'thavef ood. Som y father 

and this waiter m ade a
 
bart
er trade. My f ather gave him two silk tiesandthe waiter gave
 
us a 
cooked goose.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That was tobe yourfood on the train. Right? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.T here was none. In Europe it's very com monon holidays to eat goose 
instead of turkey. Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sohegave him  two silk tiesfor the goose
 
to take with you on the trip.
 
So then 
you takeoff f rom  Moscow. Tell usabout thetripf rom Moscow.W here did you 
go?
 

>> Julius Menn:
 
W e wentf rom  Moscow by tr ain.W e wanted to go to Odessa, which was on 
theblack sea. Some of the naked tribes, oneof  them, they camps on the railroads.T hey had 

built af ire, sothe train hadto stop. Sofortunately we hadthat goose.
  
 
W hen we came to Odessa, they conf iscatedfur coats, m y little sister had a little gold 
ring, they ripped itoff herf inger. They took everything awa y.
 
M y grandf atherhad a big stam p 
collection. And I ripped the stam psoutbeforewe lef tand put them in a big box, sothey 

conf iscated it. My f ather pleaded with the off icial and the official said, "Tell your sonhe can 

stick his hand in that box
 
without looking andwhatever he canpull out with his handhe can 
take."  
 
 
So we went ona Soviet ship, overnight basically, to 
Constantinople
.  W e wen t  f r om  t h e 
train tothe Syrian border. It's rather a long trip.

Julius Menn:
 
P i c ked  u p a  l ot  of  b ed bu gs .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I was going to ask about that.A lot of bedbugs on the train.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ehad to gof irst class. From  Syria, Lebanon, we went to Palestine. My 
father lost everything, basically in the war.W e lived in a sm all apartm ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You'reback inTel Aviv now. You're alm ost 12.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Andthe war continuedbecause the Germ ans and Italians would bomb
 
--
 
they 
tried tobom b Haif a,the ref ineries, in thenorth of the country. And if 
t h e y m i s s ed  t he  r ef i ner y,  

they would drop their bom bs onT el Aviv because they couldn't go back to their base it would 

be tooheavy. T hey didn't have enough gasoline. So every night almostf ora while we all had 

to go down to the shelter. After a while I refused to go and I stayed in bed. I said if I'm going to 

die, I'm  going todie. W hatever itm eant.
 
 
As Bill described, I joined the Haganah, the Def ense Forces, when Iwas 15.When I 
was 17, I went to off icers training course.And them ost eventful thing that happened tom e 

8 
 
there,there was a candidate, a girl, f rom  theVi
ln a
 
school who survived the ghettouprising in 
Vilna.T here was anuprising. T hey were all kil led, but shem anagedto escape. And when I 
saw her, it was oneof  the m ostem otionalm om ents inm y lif e. I gave her a big hug. And I still 

r e m em be r  i t .
 
Idescribed it all inm y book inmuch greaterdetail. ButI lookforward to your 
questions.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe get to that, a few more questionsf rom m e, if  youdon'tm ind.
 
You're 12 years old, back inT elAvi v. You started to tell us about the resistancem ovement. 

Palestine was under British control at thattime.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W e were aBritish colony.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothere were several resistancem ovem ents goingon.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
T he  
Arabs wantedtheir independence.T he Jews wanted theirs. Basically,  the 
Jewish com munity was  run by the com munalsettlem ents, Kibbutz.They were mostly lef tists. 

T oday Israel is very ri ght wing. But in those days, the leaderof  the country
 
--
 
they were lab
o r 
people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As you said to us, of  course the war is still going on andthese Jewish 
resistance groups were making plans that they m ight have tof ight the Germ ans if  Ram ullah 

was to come into Palestine.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah, because, 
rem ember, he was already in Egypt.W ethought theGerman 
forces would eventually m ove to Palestine. And theundergroundmadeplansfor thepeople to 

escape to the mountains. Fortunately it didn't come to it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you became active in the Haganahatage 15.W hat does that mean to join 
the Haganah?W hat did you do?W hat didthatm ean to you?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Ok, whenI was 15,once a week Ihad to go toa rem ote school.And in that 
school,under thef loor, they had an artif icial cover, they woul
d take out handguns, various 
arm am ents that we learned how to use.
 
 
Also, asa 15
-
year
-
old, I was invol ved
 
--
 
we wouldplaster the walls with ille gal 
pamphlets that would say to the British thatthey would have to leave. It was som ewhat 

dangerous because i
f  yo
u were caught by the CID, the Cr
im in a l 
I
nvestigate 
D
i vi s i o n  of  t he 
British police,they would beat you on the kidneys with a metal rod that was covered with 

rubber.This would leave no outside injuries but it would destroy your kidneys.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you're 15 years old and you're taking these risks?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.W hen I was 16 or so, from  an older class,a girl was killed by a tank.
 
And then when I was in the Arm y
 
--
 
f irst of all, as Bill described, I cam eto Berkeley by m ys elf. I 
basical
ly, you m ight say, escapedf rom  m y mother.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou go there, youm entioned earlier the Kibbutz. Bef ore you came to 
the UnitedStates, you had gone to work at one of the Kibbutzes, right? You toldm ean 

incident aboutbeing out in thef ields,I thinkwith tom atoes,and you got news aboutthe end of 

the war in the Pacif ic.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah.It was custom ary in Palestine that in the summ ers
 
high school students 
would go to a comm unal settlem ent to helpout with thefarm work. I spent many sum mers, 

several summ ers, indifferent com munal settlem ents.This one we had to rem ove stonesf rom  

f ields that were never used. And thispersoncam e out, said the war is over with Japan 

because of the atom icbomb. I didn't know what the atom ic bom b was. But when it said it killed 

100,000 people, whatever it was, it was scary.

>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat  wa s
 
--
 
with the war ove r andnow som e Jews were able to survi ve in 
Europe and they're com ing toPalestine
,  
what do you rememberf rom  thattim e right af terthe 
war?W hat was it like in Tel Aviv? Or in Israel, more generally.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, there was noIsrael yet.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Palestine.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
R em e
m ber, in 
`
48 it was created. Basically T el Aviv was the sam eexcept it 
becam eam uch bigger city.W hen I was 18, af ter one semester inBerkeley, I went back
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou tell us that, how did you make thedecision to gof rom Palestineto 
B
erkeley, California,to go to school? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, there were several generationsof  students who went to school in 
Calif ornia, inBerkeley and Davis. And they told m e the clim ate is good,easy tof ind a job,and 
theuniversity was ver yinexpensi
ve .
 
 
T o give you an ideahow m uch I paidat theuniversit y,
 
$60 wasf or the hospitaland so 
on, and then
 
$600 persem ester. And there were two semesteras ayear. And you could take 
as many unitsas youwant. T hat was more or less thenorm . I know that tod
a y it is cra zy.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How did your parentsfeel about you going to Calif ornia, to the United States, 
m uch less to Calif ornia, onthe other side of the United States? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
As I said, the climate was good, you couldf inda job, education was 
inexpensive, it was really paradise.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So it'sparadise. You're in the UnitedStates.But you weren't there long. You 
went back.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I went back.I was in the Army alm ost two years. In1950, two weeks after I 
got out, I was ona ship to gobackto Berkeley.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I wantyou to share with us astory you toldme.W hen you lef tBerkeley thef irst 
tim e to go backfor theW ar of Independence,you went back and
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I wanted to leave som e time.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:
 
W edo. I have onem ore questionf or you.Sotell usabout when you got to 
New York, there was a dinner or aparty thrown f or you bef ore you're going back to Palestine 

tof ight intheW arof  Independence.T ell us about that.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Oh. There wer
e these people in the Bronx who invi tedm etoa party. I went. 
And there were all kinds of Jewish veteransf rom W orldW ar II, andthey wanted to give m e all 

kinds of weaponsto take back.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothis party, all these people bring out their weapons to take with you.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
It was ver y m oving. But I could only take one.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you served in the Arm y for two m ore years. Youfought intheW arof  
Independence.W hat was that likefor you? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell,  th e  A rm y wa s cra zy.
 
Each one haddiff erent uniform s. As you know, they 
beat the Arab arm ies. It was a m iracle. Therewere several thousand survi vors of  the 

Holocaust who arrived. Many of them were draf ted imm ediately, withoutany training tof ight in 

t h e W ar  of  I nd ep e ndenc e .
 
 
T he British, in them eantim e, rem em ber, they gave up. So May
 
15, I think, when the 
B rit is h  ga ve
 
up, them andate. Andthe 7th
 
theArab arm ies attacked.Somehow this sm all 
Jewish Arm y succeeded in def ending itself . Ihad goodf riends whowere killed in that war. And 

I of ten thinkabout them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Once Israel had its independence, you returned toBerkeley and com pleted 
your educationand began your new career.

T here'sm any other things I'd like to ask youbut let's do turn toouraudienceand see
 
if  they have questions for you.

W ehave a m icrophone in each aisle.W e're going to ask that you wait until the 
m icrophone is handedto you if  you have a question. Pleasem ake your question asbrief  as 
y
ou can. I will repeat the question justto be sure that we hear it properly up herebefore Julius 
responds to it.
 
 
It's a little hardf or us to see because of the glare of  the light, so help usout. Let us 
know

I have one right in thefront row and one inthe m iddlehere.You're going to com e

>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, I knew a little bitfrom  schoolbut in Berkeley
 
--
 
I understood whatthe 
prof essor would say but in some courses I couldn't write m y notes in English soI wrote them  in 

Hebrew.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
It's p ret
ty hard to keep trackof all the languagesthat he knew. Right? 
 
 
Ok. Do we have one back here?W ehad one right here. Right in the m iddle.There we 
go. You go ahead, please.

The question is
 
--
 
fo r
 
you in your childhood
,  
what do you think was the hardest 
ordeal for you?
 

>> Julius Menn:
 
T he hardest thing was to give up m yf riends to gooverseas again. Some of  
thosef riends I never gained back.T hat was very diff icult.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And a lot of this was when you lef tPalestine to return toPoland, right? Yeah. 
O k.  

 
All right. T hank you.
 
 
W ehave one here and then oneback there.

[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Have you returned to Tel Aviv or Israel recently?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
N ot  
inthe last 10 years because I'm  opposedtothis governm ent. But 10years

[Question Inaudible]

>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwas it like f or you in the Arm y? Isthat the question? Yeah.W hat was it 
like for you tobe in the Arm y? A young man is asking you this question.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
It was a very inf orm al Arm y. I worked part of the time. I was transferred to the 
m edical corpsand I assisted indermatology, 
syphilology,
 
and gonorrhea.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
O k .  F or s u re .

[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hen did 
you 
learn about the Nazi's s ystem aticm urder of more than s
ix m illio n  
Jews? W hat was
 
--
 
what do you rem em ber
 
--
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell,we learned about itduring the war in Palestine
,  in
 
the early 
`
40s.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know how m anyf am ily m em bers you lostduring the Holocaust? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
T here were si
x m illion people lost. W hen I lecture inMassachusetts,I tell the 
kids usually high school, I said just im agine you getup in the morning and all thepeople in 
Massachusettsare dead. Because that's about six m illion in Massachusetts and six m illion. 

Yeah
. But also there were many gypsies, Pols, and transgenderpeople who were killed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkwe have tim efor a couple more questions.There's one back here inthe 
back. T wo back there. Ok.
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Great question. There's a lot of  14 and 15
-
year
-
olds in thisaudience. T here's a 
lot of  14 and 15
-
year
-
olds in thisaudience. W hatm essage would you like those youngsters to 
takeback with them? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell,first of all, you shouldn't forget that there was a
 
Holocaust and Holocaust 
is also today
 i
n Darf ur,m ust remember, Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia. Holocaust is atilt in the 
human system . If you think about it, theGermans were the most educated people in Europe 

and yet they were able to do this doctor carry out this awful thing.T hey declared that som e 

people are below people. They are worse than dom estic anim als.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you, Julius.
 
 
T here was one other one.
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Have you visited any concentration camps?Infact,
 
you were just telling m e 
about onethat you were at.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
Yeah,I visited theone where the inmates rebelled.300 were able to escape 
to theforest butthey were betrayed by thenative people so only 30or so survived. And I met 

this wom an, very elega nt wom an, older wom an, at the Holocaustm useum and she said, "I 

stabbeda Nazi to death."Because she was in that cam p. And that's what shedid.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I have onem ore question foryou, Julius, bef ore we end.W hen we f inish, 
you're going to
 
sign copies of your book, your m em oir.
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
I want to say som ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yes. Iwanted to ask you what it meantf or youto wri te your memoir. And 
secondly, it covers you r f irst 21 years.W hy did you stop at age 21?
 
>> Julius Menn:
 I 
lost two children about40 years ago. I didn't wantto write about it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hathas it meant to you to have written them em oir? 
 
>> Julius Menn:
 
W ell, I'm  glad Idid.Becausefor grandchildren it's very im portant.T hey should 
know som ething about their grandfather.
 
 
Andalso, I want to say about the Holocaust, you shouldneverf orget. I think thef act 
that youare here should help not tof orget
, n
ot toforget because the people who lived through 
it, like m yself , are very old and thereare very few lef t.
