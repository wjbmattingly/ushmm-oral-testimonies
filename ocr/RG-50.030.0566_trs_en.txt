Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Muse
um interview with Mr. 
Joachim Ba er
, conducted by 
Ina Navazelskis
 on March 1
st
, 2010, in 
Leisure 
World, 
in 
Wheato n, Mary land 
Œ or
 Silv er Spring? 
Answer: 
Silver Spring. 
Q: 
Silver Spring, Maryland
. Thank you Mr.
 Baer
 for Œ 
A: 
Baer. 
Q: 
Baer, 
for coming to speak with us today. An
d as I said in our introduction that 
was not on tape, what we™d lik
e to do is start at the ve
ry beginning. Where were you 
born; did you have si
blings; what was your family ci
rcumstances Œ what were your 
family circumstances; who were
 your mo th er and father? 
A: Fine. 

Q: So maybe we could start there. 
A: My Œ my  name is
 Joachim Baer
. I was born in
 Hamburg
 in December 20, 
1929. I have a sister who is about four 
years older than I am. My father was a 
physician, he was a Zionist
, and he didn™t look Jewish
. And he had good pair Œ 
relation with patient. Interesting enough, myŒ the patient always talked to the Œ to 

the Œ the doctors, and they
 told my father that 
Hitler
 is build ing tanks
 and preparing

for war. And he make a state m
ent  and everyone thought that he is cr azy, that he say 
that 
Hitler
 is going to gas the Jews. 
Q: Who, this man? 
A: No, my father make that sta Œ  
Q: Your father Œ your father made the statement. 

A: Œ ke Œ statement that that™s what he ™s going to do. And mo st people thought my  

father is crazy.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And that was the atmosphere that time.
 And in teresting en ough, my  w Œ my wi Œ 

my mother was afraid to go to 
Palestine
, that was like a desert land. And in 1933 
they took a ship and went to 
Palestine
 to see if you can live there. And th en he saw 
that™s not so terrible, and th
at™s when he start making pr
eparation. But the t-turning 
point was that one day, I believe in 1935, 
Hitler
 decided Jewish phi-physician 
cannot have any mo re non-Jewish patient. And my  father was a doctor like 
[indecipherable]
 wh ere he lost a lot of his busine
ss. So that was a turning point, 
and he say, it™s time to go. 
Q: Can I i-interrupt just for a second? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Because I™d like to even
 step back a little further.

A: Okay . 
Q: You were born in 1929. 

A: Right. 
Q: And with  a sister who was four years older. 
A: About, yeah. 

Q: Okay . And your father was a physician. 

A: Right. 
Q: Did your mo ther work outside
 the home, or was she at home? 
A: No, no, she was a homemaker. 
Q: Do you count yourself as a well-to-
do family because your father was a 
physician, or was that not as such
 a prestigious post as it is in the 
United States,
 for 
example? 

A: Well, doctors in 
Germany
, they  didn™t wa Œ didn™t make that kind of money like 
they do in the 
United States. 
But we had a very nice apar
tment, and he had a office 
near the harbor, because his sp
ecialty was venereal disease. 
Q: Ah, venereal diseases. 

A: And Œ yeah, and so he ha
d to have all those sailor, which had sy philis. In those 
days there was no penicillin to cure th
em. So they suffer and it was a booming 

business, so to speak.

Q: I can imagine, because 
there was that section in 
Ha mbu rg
, isn™t there, where 
there™s Œ what is it called now? 
A: Yeah, there Œ yeah, the Œ the 
Reeperbahn
. 
Q: 
Reeperbahn,
 yeah, exactly. 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yeah. So Œ so we we
re well-to-do, but I mean, the Œ it Œ the Œ 
Q: Did you have servan ts at home? 

A: Yes, we had a 
dienstmädchen, 
you know, for the kids. 
Q: A nanny. 

A: A nanny, and we had, I th
ink, another help, we had about s-seven, eight rooms, I 
don™t know. It was a Œ it was well-to-do, ni
ce neighborhood. But 
we didn™t go Œ the 
thing is, he was Œ I don™t know what time, when he got to 
Hamburg
 to settle down, 
but it was not too many years. 

Q: Oh, so he wasn™t from 
Hamburg
? 
A: No, no, no. He was born in 
Posen
, which is in east
 Germany,
 so to speak. 
Q: Correct.  

A: And then after World War I, 
Posen
 turned to be 
Poland. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: So the family went and settled down in 
Berlin. 
Q: I see.

A: And the reason we got to 
Hamburg
, because my  father needed to  have a harbor 
where the sailor comes. My father was hi
gh intellect person, and he knew all the 
language, Norw egian 
[indecipherable]
 so he could talk to all the sailors. 
Q: Sailors. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I wonder what he Œ if th

of treatment he did give 
them. 
A: Was a very unpleasant treatme nt. It wa Œ was a Œ 
Q: Tough. 

A: Œ was a Œ was a tough, yeah, it was a t
ough one, right. So, the thing is, one Œ how 
we got to Œ my mother want
ed to go first may b e to 
Europe
. And she and my  father 
say no, if we go, we get out of 
Euro pe.
 
Q: Oh, wo-w ould your 
Œ I™m still back in 
Berlin. 
A: Oh, oh, okay. 
Q: Yeah, I really want to start at
 the beginning, before the politics. 
A: Okay , okay.

st background fam
ily. My mother not. 
My father was Œ came from a religious, no
t Œ not super Orthodox, but conservative 
Orthodox family. And my
 mother had very little 
Yiddishkeit,
 so to speak. So he 
was a Œ he was a philosopher too. I mean, he knew 
Shea ,
 he knew 
Spino za
 and he 
knew th-the Bible, and he was a high inte
llected person. He gave speeches, he was

A: Well, they were very nice parents, I m
ean, they were very lovely to me and as Œ 
my sister . And he was high intellect, so he 
used to take me for a walk and sh ow me 
the Œ the Œ the st Œ the stars, and this is the big 
[indecipherable]
 there™s the smaller

. And he gave lectures, and you
 know, so it was Œ and I had 
problem with my Bible, he always explai
ned to me. So he was high intelligence. 
Q: And do you have
 memo ries o f  
Hamburg
 itself, of the apartment that you lived 
in? 
A: Yeah, well, interesting, I remember Œ s
ee Œ see, the harbor was a main port. And 
one day my father had a patie
nt, a captain on the ship. So  he mem Œ he took me, I 
think with my mothe
r, for dinner, whatever it is, on this Œ on th-the captain table. 
An orange was a big sensation 
those days, an orange. So  Œ so as I wi Œ wouldn™t be 
caught in a Œ in a custom, I put the orange 
in my little ba Œ in my
 little coat. So this 
way we went though th e custom. 
Q: So, in other words, in order to be gues ts of the captain on 
the ship , you ha Œ you 
were leaving the territory of 
Germany
, and had to go through customs?

 thing I rememb er, there was a 
Greek boy in our building and 
I used to play with him. 
And one day he didn™t want 
to play with him. So I came
 to my  mo ther, oh, crying, he doesn™t want to play  with 
him. But the reason he wouldn™t play me, 
because he knew I am Jewish, and Jewish 
was taboo. But my  sister, who was 10 year s old, she knew what was going on, and 

she really was so relieved getting out of 
Germany
, because she knew what™s going 
on. 
Q: That Œ those few years made a huge difference. 
A: Yes. Also, my Œ my sister was very

knew what exactly. Also, she went to a Jewish school.
