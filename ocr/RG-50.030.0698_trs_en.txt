to be honest, never lie Œ liar, or somethi
ng like that. And she ha
d heart, I don™t matter 
how you can divide everything wh at we ha

happens when 
Germ any

, and Polish so ldiers were going so 
unhappy, hu Œ very hungry. 
Mo ther took ev erything what

A: Of course, radio. We had, and it was all government left 
Poland
, but what to do? 
Poland
 was not prepared for war, because we ha
d only twa Œ 20 years to start to be 
alone, not divided between our friends, 
Germany
 and 
Russia
. Therefore, it was 
completely too hard even
 understand why, because 
Russia
 is so big 
[indecipherable]
 
they came first of September came 
Germany
, without telling that we start to Œ to 
fight and this is beginni
ng of war. They came, killing as much as possible, 
bombard ing ne Œ it was a really very hard
 time. But 17 days later, our friend from 
Russia
 came to divide some part for themsel
f. On the beginning they said that, we 
brought you freedom, we have to  
help Po lish people against ru Œ 
Germany
. But after 
a couple Œ couple months later, th

Siberia

 Warsaw
