Question:  This is the United States Holoca
ust Memorial Museum interview with Doris 
Small.  Conducted by Milda Morkyte on th
e 16th of October at the Kindertransport 
Association Conference in Arli
ngton, Virginia. So, Doris, let'
s start from the beginning.  
Please tell me when -- when 
you were born?  Where?  
 

Answer:  I was born in Berlin
, Germany, in July 1923. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  And you were
 born Doris -- as Doris -- 
 
A: Dora Costinski (ph). 
 
Q: Dora Costinski.  Who are your parents? 
 
A: My parents came from Pola
nd, but my father was a prisoner in the first World War 
taken by the Germans and that's h o w he got to
 Germany.  And that's  how my  sister and I 
were born there. 
 
Q: What were your parents names? 
 
A: My father name was Max Mosik in Polis
h or Hebrew, Moshe.  Whichever name you 

want to pick. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: My mother was Hilda Moyim (ph) and in German Maria.
 
Q: Uh-huh.  And you see -- you had two sisters? 
 
A: I had one sister. 
 
Q: One sister.  
 
A: And one brother.  I'm the youngest one.  I was. 
 
Q: What were their names a
nd when were they born?  
 
A: My brother?  
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: My brother's name  was Alan Baer Costinsk
i.  He want that last n ame.  And he was 
born in Larch, Poland.  And he came with my
 mother just shortly before the -- the first 
World War to Germany. 
 
Q: With your mother only? 
 
A: Yeah.  Because my father was a prisoner 
in a German prison camp.  And she knew 
about it.  She walked 
all the way from -- but the Germans 
came  and they took everything 
away and there was nothing left.  She had tw
o more children younger 
than the one that I 
knew, and that's a boy and girl
, but they both died, I real
ly don't know how.  But the 
Germans came in and they -- th
at's the first World War. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 

A: And they  destroyed everything and there 
was nothing left for her.  So when she only 
had that one little boy left, she took him and sh
e walked  all night.  And during the day, 
she stopped over somewhere on a farm, and 
only nights she walk
ed until she -- by the 
time she reached th
e border from Poland to
 Germany, the war was practically over and 
she just walked across.  And she went to th e prison camp where my father was and they 
got together.  And th ere was nothing to  go back to
 to Poland.  So they 
stayed in Germany.  
But then later on after they got
 a little established, my sister was born in 1921 and I was 
born in 1923. 
 
Q: What's  your sister's name? 
 
A: IdA:  
 
Q: Okay.  So what do you re
memb er fro m Ber lin ?  T ell me 
about your childhood.  What 
did your parents do? 
 
A: Well, after the war it wasn 't bad.  We we
re free.  But unfortunate -- which had nothing 
to do with Hitler -- when
 I was only three years old, my mo
ther fell down a flight of stairs 
and she never recovered.  It wasn 't  anybody's 
fault.  It was her own fault.  She should 
have gone into the hospital and be in a cast.
  But she said, I have small children and I 
can 't afford to go into a cas
t and she neglected herself, wh
ich had nothing to do with 
Hitler or anything.  He wasn't even there yet.
  And, of course, after a while instead of 
getting better, she got worse.  And she's been in and out of hospitals since I rememb er.  

So I was only three so I barely remember my
 mo ther.  And by the time I started school 
there was talk about Hitler being the new chan
cellor of Germany.  So my father said, 
well, I think we're going to  put the girls right
 away in a Jewish school.  Because my 
brother went to a German school. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: When he first came to Germ
any he couldn't speak the la
nguage, but it was different.  
But when he heard about Hitler 
being so much against Jews, he
 says, I'm not going to put 
the girls in the Jew -- in the German school.  
So we went right away into a Jewish school. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: From the time we started kindergarten. 
 
Q: But you could speak German? 
 
A: Well, we learned German
 and we learned Hebrew --
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 

A: -- in the school.  We had every morning 
one hour of Hebrew fro
m Mo nd ay  to
 Friday  
five days a week and th en it was from eight 
to nine.  And nine o'clock we had regular 
subjects, German, arithmetic, 
geography, history, you know --
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: -- regular subjects.  But it 
was only for Jewish children. 
 
Q: So most of your friends were Je
wish or did you have German friends? 
 
A: Well, not really because mostly after school
 you go to somebody's house.  But as I did 
not really have a home to go -- I mean, I 
had a home but there was nobody there --
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: -- because my mother was in
 and out of the hospital.  My
 father was busy and I had to 
make a living so  we had to go to day care.  So
 straight from school we went into  day care 
and we were there until six o 'clock at night. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: By that time my father was home -- and so I -- 
 
Q: So the day care was for German ch ildren too, right?  It wasn 't -- 
 
A: No, it was Jewish. 
 
Q: Oh, it was Jewish? 
 
A: It was a Jewish day care, ye
s.  We had so rt of a hot me
al during the day so at night 
wasn't much of a meal just, 
like, a sandwich or something. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  And wh at did your father do? 
 
A: Well, as I said he was in 
the Army when he -- before he
 came to Germany.  So he 
didn't  really have a profession.  So  the -- at fi
rst, he did whatever he could ju st to make a 
living for us.  But then he opened up a little 
tobacco store.  And those days everybody 
smoked and it was a good business.  He was 
doing -- I mean, we were not rich, but he 
made a living.  We had enough to pay rent. 
 There was always food
 on the table and he 
was doing all right. 
 
Q: So you remember H itler comin g  to power?  
 
A: Yes.  By the time I started school it was pr
actically -- as a matter of
 fact, they used to 
put on th e radio in th e schools and 
we had to  listen to his speech. 
 
Q: Oh, in the -- 
 
A: In the Jewish school. 
 

Q: -- Jewish school? 
 
A: Yeah.  So his voice... 
 
Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism
 when you were a child or before? 
 
A: You mean in the street?  Well, at the be
ginning in the early '30s it wasn't bad.  
Everybody was very nice to us.  And as a ma
tter of fact, we liv
ed in an apartment 
build ing.  It was a walker.  And as you come
 up the stairs there were two apartments on 
each floor.  Here was our apartment and this
 was a -- G erman people.  And there was 
only one wall between our living room and 
their living room and you could hear 
practically -- when they walked
 or every wo rd  they said, you know, like the next room.  
And we had no problem.  I don'
t even know if there were ot
her Jewish people in this 
apartment building.  There were four floors, 
something like that.  But because I wasn't 
home all day.  I just left 7:30 in  the mo rning to
 go to school.  I came home late at night.  I 
never saw anybody.  But the la
dy that lived right next door 
to us on the same floor, my  
father used to go early in th
e mo rning, like, six o'clock a
nd th at -- those days we didn't 
have refrigeration -- and used to
 go down  and buy some grocer
ies.  I don't know if every 
day.  Depends on th e weather how long you can
 keep it.  And ev ery time used to come 
out early in the morning and the lady came out. 
 She used to say, good mo rning to  you.  
How are you how?  How is your wife doing
?  Because she knew sh e was sick.  Once -- 
so sorry.  You got smal
l children and with a sick mother. 
 And they were friendly people. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  Do you know their name or -- 
 
A: Oh, I can't rememb er the name.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I know there was only a la
dy and a young boy was there. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: I don't know.  He was like a teenager late
r on.  And as we (?certain?) were so many 
years.  But then in 
1936 my  mo ther passed away.  And,
 you know, I wouldn't even know 
it but -- you know what a Minyan is?  
 
Q: No.  
 
A: You have a ShivA: 
 
Q: Oh. 
 
A: Yeah.  Or when  somebody passes aw
ay for one week  we have mourning. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 

A: Which they call a ShivA:  People come in
 the morning for servic
e and they  used to 
come in the evening.  Twice 
we have the Minyan.  Minyan 
means you have to have at 
least 10 people. 
 
Q: Oh, yes.  Yes.  
 
A: 10 men to make the service.  S o  in '
36 it wasn't bad.  My father belonged to the 
synagogue, people used to come.  We're not 
allowed to go out for 
one week and people 
bring you food to th e house.  
So we were in that whole we
ek.  We didn't  go anywhere.  
But the next -- the follow
ing Sunday -- my mo
ther died on a Friday in
 July of '36.  So on 
Sunday was the funeral.  So 
the following Sunday when we fi
nished the Shiva, my father 
was going down stairs to 
buy groceries for following week or
 days.  So the minute he got 
into the store the lady ju
mp ed on him.  She says, I know yo
ur wife died more than a week 
ago and you did not turn in her ration cards. 
That's  how I reme mb er we mu st have been 
on ration.  '36.  That was three years before
 the war.  And if you ask me, I wouldn't even 
know we were on ration.  Just because he came
 up and he told us the story. So he says, I 
beg your pardon.  I was in mourning.  We 
don't go out for one week.  And I came  down 
this morning to turn her in
 ration card and buy my  groceries. So she calmed down. 
Because in '36 it wasn 't too bad. 
 
Q: When  did it get bad? 
 
A: You could still talk to a Jewish person.  Bu
t when we went to th
e park all the benches 
had written on, not for Jews.  
You couldn't sit on.  But ther
e were only three benches in 
that whole big park, huge park, only fo r 
Jews.  But nobody ever sat on those three 
benches.  I remember that beca
use some time on a Saturday -- 
 
Q: How did you feel about that, that you couldn't -- 
 
A: We were just kids, you know.  But like on
 the Saturday  or Sunday wh en we didn't  go 
to school or day care we use to say, oh, Papa
, can we go to the park ?  You know, but he 
work ed hard all week.  He had to  get up early.
  And he said, oh, I'm 
so tired.  So in the 
winter, of course, he used to go sleep in 
the afternoon.  But in th e summer, you know, he 
tried to be nice.  I mean, I didn't  realize, you know, we had no mo ther mo st of the time, 

and he was mo ther and father. 
 But when you're a child, you d
on't realize that it's  a double 
job fo r him. So he tried to be 
nice and he took us to the park
 as much as he could.  And I 
remember one day we were in 
the park, we were playing some
thing like hopscotch on the 
floor, my sister and I.  And he sat down on 
the bench and it said, not for Jews.  But he 
had covered the writing. 
 
Q: Oh.  
 
A: And he figures, well -- but he did not look 
Jewish because he had light eyes.  He had 
gray hair since I remember.  So
 he mu st have been on th e light side.  And th en a man, a 

German ma n, came and sat down next to hi
m on the bench.  And 
he was watching us 
playing and he tried to make a conversation with
 my  father.  He didn't know who he was.  
So he says, you know, I feel so
rry for those children.  Isn 't it 
terrible what th
ey 'r e doing to 
them? At that time -- so my fath
er just sat and he nodded.  He didn't say anything.  So  we 
just came o v er and we said, oh, Papa, some
thing -- wh en he hear
d us calling him papa, 
which means father, he realized that he was 
our father.  And he got
 up and he flew away 
like they were chasing him.  In
 case they catch him talking to
 him, they'll arrest him.  
That's  how bad it was. 
 
Q: So that was later and not -- because 
you said in '36 it wasn't that bad.  
 
A: No.  Yeah, '36 it wasn 't too bad. 
 But Hitler was in power since '33. 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
 
A: And '36 it was already -- you know -- 
 
Q: So do you remember -- 
 
A: It was hard to walk in the street. 
 
Q: Was it gradually that... 
 
A: Yeah.  Little by little it got worse and worse.
  But then later on the lady came up.  Did 
I say this already?  And she said, how is your
 wife and all this?  And then she says, well, 
you have to excuse me, I wouldn't able
 to say good mo rning to  you anymore. 
 
Q: Oh.  
 
A: Because my son is now in the Hitler Youths
.  16-year-old boy.  And if he sees me 
talking to  you, he'll report 
me.  I'm  talking to a Jew. 
 
Q: Oh.  
 
A: 16 years old.  She was afraid of him.  
Right next door.  We were
 living next door to 
each other for years.  She says, I have noth
ing against you personal.  We'v e been living 
together fo r a long time.  We'v e been -- you've
 been a good neighbo
r.  It's nothing.  So  
my  father just said, I understand.  He knew.  It
 wasn't her fault.  She's a very nice lady.  
 
I don't know if there was a man there because 
he only was talking about her and th e son. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: So I have no idea if there was a father there or not. 
 
Q: But you do rememb er
 her and her son? 
 

A: I don't too well.  But my father used to s
ee her very often.  Sh e probably  went out th e 
same time when heused to
 go out in the morning. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: Maybe she had to go to
 wo rk  or something, you know.  But there was nothing 
personal.  Sh e was very  nice.  We lived toge
ther for years, you know.  People lived next 
door, they  have problems, too mu ch noise, fi
ghting.  You know, we never had a problem. 
 
Q: So -- 
 
A: But then, of course, in 1938 all of a su dden -- as soon as my  mo ther died he start 
getting sick.  But he just was losing his voice. 
 So he went to the doctor a few times.  Was 
treating him for a cough -- cough medicine.  An
d we had no ideA :  Finally, we found out 
that it was more than a cough, 
he had thro at cancer.  And --
 
Q: He was work ing at the tobacco -- 
 
A: -- he suffered for two years.  And to the da
y same July two years later he passed away. 
 
Q: And now were how old?  
 
A: 14. 
 
Q: 14?  
 
A: Yeah.  I was 12 when my mo
ther died.  I was only three when sh e got sick.  She was 
bedridden for nine years.  See -- wh
ich had nothing to do with Hitler. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: It a different story.  It's just my story. 
 
Q: Yes.  That's -- 
 
A: Yeah.  But then
 in '38 it was already very bad.  Bu
t while my father was still alive he 
was trying so hard to  get us out
.  He kept writing letters and 
letters to family he had in 
New York.  And he says, it's 
getting very bad here.  I don'
t care for myself, I'm  an old 
man.  He was in his 50s.  He thought he wa
s old.  Bu t the children, please, try to do 
something for the children.  So
 you know what they wrote 
him back, if you need a few 
dollars, I'll send it to you. 
 
Q: Where are the relatives? 
 
A: Yeah, relatives. 
 
Q: And where -- 
 
A: In New York . 
 

Q: How close were they -- what was the relationship? 
 
A: Well, unfortunately, my father lost his mo
ther giving -- she was giving birth to  him.  
She died in childbirth.  And 
those brothers and sister were
 from seco nd wife.  So they 
were half brothers and sisters.  
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: But he wrote to the sister and he said -- 
 
Q: What was her name? 
 
A: Oh, no, please. 
 
Q: Oh, yeah.  Sure.  
I'm -- sure.  Sure.  
 
A: I don't want to in case somebody's alive, 
I don't want to say it.  But -- {laughter} but 
she says -- he says, I don't want any money.  
I need a visA:  Please take the children out.  
Things are very, very  bad here
.  Never answ ered.  And it was -- but in '36 and '38, the 
two years -- he was sick for two years.  For -- as soon as she died he start gettin g sick.  
'38 he died.  They  both died in July  and 
both on a Friday.  Isn '
t that something?  
 
Q: That's a -- 
 
A: Friday is such a day for me.  Well, anyhow so -- 
 
Q: So you were left
 orphans in '3 8? 
 
A: Yes, we were left orphans.  That was in July
 of '38.  But as I said, my  brother was a lot 
older than me because he was born in Poland.
  There were two more children after him. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: There must have been, like,
 two or three years old, or four something.  A little boy and 
a little girl but he was the oldest one.  So 
that's why he's so mu
ch older than we -- 
 
Q: So how -- how old was he? 
 
A: Well, he was 10 years older than my  sister.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And 12 years older than me.  Because, as I 
said, when they were in Poland, like, he 
was six years old and the little one probably wa s two and four.  So by the time he came to  

Germany mu st have been seven, almo st eight. 
 
Q: So he was around 27 around that time? 
 

A: Yeah.  But then th
ey took a few years before my si
ster and I were born because you 
just can 't h ave children. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: You got to get established, you got to get 
a place to live, you know.  It was just -- it 
was in the war.  He was a prisoner, you know
.  So, you know, he had to wait until he 
makes a little money to get an apartment.  A
nd then my  sister and I were born in the early 
'20s.  So my  brother was really
 quite a bit older, 10 years older. 
 
Q: So he had already -- did he alrea
dy have a job when  y
ou're father died? 
 
A: My brother?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: Yeah, he was working. 
 
Q: What did he do? 
 
A: Well, he was working by machine, like, tail
oring because he didn't
 have -- he couldn't 
go to  higher education, you know.  And so he 
had to do whatever to
 make a living.  And 
my father had the tobacco store.  And around 
Christmastime they used
 to have -- I don't if 
they're called -- what you call it he
re it -- like a Christmas market. 
 
Q: Yeah, I guess a Christma s mar k et.  
 
A: Yeah, they had -- they opened  up tables and -- 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: -- sell things a few weeks -- like, a month be
fore Ch ristma s.  So after school he used 
to take merchandise from our father's store, 
opened  a table, put up cigarettes and cigars 
and tobacco.  And they  would sell.  You're 
-- because it was so cold
, Christmastime, and 
they saw a young kid, 12, 14 y
ears old and they used to  buy from him and he make mo re 
money th an my  father made in the store.  
He was jealous on him. He was a good brother 
and a good son.  And, of course
, after my fath er died it was very hard.  We couldn't even 
get a Minyan to go to for th
e funeral.  We went to the cemetery when we buried our 
father.  And my father was collecting peop
le and paying them so
 we could have 10 
people for the funeral for the se
rvice.  Isn 't th at terrible?  
 
Q: So why was -- 
 
A: Because there was not many Jews left 
and -- from the congregation I'm talk ing, you 
know.  And there were very few and it was very
 hard .  It was bad already.  We wouldn't 
walk in the street.  They us
ed to throw rocks at us.  
And ev en going to school.  
 

Q: Did you have to wear the star? 
 
A: Not at that time.  It started after -- afte
r I already came to England.  So it was -- but 
they used to throw -- especially  in the winter.  They used to
 take a rock and put the snow 
on it, like, a snowball.  And they used 
to throw that.  It was so painful. 
 
Q: Was it children who would do that?  
 
A: Kids.  Yeah.  Teenage.  They
 used to throw the rocks.  It 
was so painful.  I was afraid 
to go -- we walked to school.  We had no trans
portation.  So I was rea
lly afraid to go to 
school.  And after my father 
died, you know, my  brother even
 tried very hard.  And, you 
know, he felt like a young father to us.  He 
was so mu ch older.  He was responsible. 
 
Q: He was.  
 
A: He was trying to make a living for us.  
Well, thank God my  father put away a few 
dollars.  We didn't have it in the bank.  So  ju
st a couple months later -- well, he died in 
July, this was August, September, October.  Th
ree months later.  O ctober 28, to be the 
exact date.  Early in the mo rning, about 7:30 
in the mo rning on a Frid
ay, Friday morning, 
the doorbell rang.  A policeman was outside. 
 I was afraid  to open the door.  And my 
brother was just getting ready 
to go to the syna
gogue for the Minyan, you know, to say 
Kaddish for my father.  He said a whole ye
ar Kaddish first for my mother.  Now, he 
stopped a little.  Now, he had to say it for my fa
ther. So he was just getting ready to go to 
say Kaddish for my father.  And when the d oorbell rang, he came out.  He was still in 
pajamas.  I looked th rough 
the peephole.  He says, who'
s at the door?  I said, it's a 
policeman.  He says, open the door.  We 
didn't do anything.  Why are you afraid?  
 
I was afraid  to open the door.  He went ov
er, opened th e door, and the policeman says, 
Herr Costinski?  You know, his name.  And he sa
ys, yes, it's me.  So he says, better come 

and see -- please come with me.  So he says, 
wait a minute.  What did I do?  He said, oh, 
I know you didn't do anything.  Bu t we just 
want to take you to the police headquarters 
ask you some questions.T
hen he looked at us two, my  si
ster and me, kids.  He says, oh, 
he'll be back soon.  So  he said
, would you mind if I get dressed 
first?  He was in pajamas.  
To him he didn't  care what he
 wore.  They wore pajamas a
nyhow in the camp.  So he 
says, all right.  But make it snappy.  Leave th
e door open.  Watched him getting dressed.  
So, you know, if you're in a hurry, you don't 
look wh at you're going to wear.  Whatever 
was there you put on.  A pair of pants and a t
op.  By  the first Oct
ober 28th, 1938, the day 
of the deportation and it was cold.  But you figur
e he'll b e back in a co
uple of hours.  So  
he didn't put a sweater or a jacket or anything. 
 Just a shi rt and pants.
  And he took him.  I 
went through the front room and I saw a truc
k down there and I saw him sitting right in 
the corner.  He said he'll be ba
ck soon, right?  That's the last
 time I ever saw him.  I never 
saw him after that day.  I never forget 
this day.  We waited and waiting th e whole 
weekend. 
 

Q: You were staying -- and you st
ayed at home and you waited?  
 
A: But it was Friday morning.  We waited Sa
turday and Sunday.  He never came back.  I 
never went back to school either, not since th
at day.  I never saw any of my  schoolmates 
or teachers.  Anybody.  
 
Monday mo rning was the first of Novemb er a
nd the doorbell rang.  
W h en  I saw  th e ag en t 
from the landlord outside, I wasn
't afraid to open the door because I've known him since I 
was a little girl.  So I open the 
door and I said, oh, good mornin
g.  You came for the rent.  
I'll go and get it.  First of the mo nth.  Ever
y first of the month -- we didn't pay checks that 
time.  We used to pay cash.  My father alwa
ys taught me, every week  you put a quarter of 
the rent away.  So when
 the month comes, rent is the mo st important thing.  Even if you 
have nothing else, no money, y
ou got to have a roof over yo
ur head.  So when I turn -- 
oh, you came for the rent.  I'll 
go and get it.  He said.  No, no
, no, no, no.  I didn't come 
for the rent.  I came to ask you two girls to le
ave this apartment at o n ce.  I said, why?  
We're paid up.  We don't owe anything.  So 
he said, oh, I know y
ou don't know anything 
but you're both minors and you cannot occupy th is
 place.  So I said, but my brother is not 
a minor.  He was older than us.  And since ou
r father died it was put on his name.  So he 
said, but you brother isn't here. 
 I said, he's only been gone tw
o days.  He'll be back.  Oh, 
no.  Your brother was deported and he will never come back. 
 
Q: That's what he told you?  
 
A: And he knew us for years sinc
e we are little girl.  While I was talking to him my sister 
went to get the money and she came out with
 cash from the other room, and wh en he saw 
all that mo ney in her hand he to ok the whol
e month's rent.  And then -- I mean, he knew 
us for so many years since we
 were little.  All of a sudden
, you know, he was really 
following orders.  But he didn't w ant to do it,
 but he had no choice. 
 So he said, okay.  
Okay .  I'll let you say a little longer.  And he 
took the whole month's rent.  But that week 
was Kristallnacht. 
 
Q: Oh, it with was the same week? 
 
A: November. 
 
Q: So did you -- wh en he told
 you that your brother was de
ported, did you believe that?  
Did you understand what that meant or... 
 
A: We heard on the radio that they  deporte
d all of the Jewish men from 16 to 60 from 
Berlin.  And from -- as it's smallest towns,
 women and children also.  But from Berlin 
itself it was men and boys from 16 to 60.  So
 he was over 16.  And,
 you know, they came 
for my father too a little later because he was 
under 60.  He was in his 50s so they came 
for him too.  And he was already dead.  It didn't go in yet -- 
 

Q: Oh.  
 
A: -- you know.  So  I said, you can't have 
him anymore, he's gone.  Okay .  They  didn't 
care.  But they would have deported 
him too.  See, and we were alone. 
 
Q: And you were left alone an
d you became the -- no, your 
sister was older than you, 
right? 
 
A: Yeah.  She was 16.  Still young. 
 
Q: So what did you do after the landlord left? 
 
A: We looked around the apar
tment and, you know, there were
 five of us living here now 
there's only two left.  What do
 you take and where do you go
?  We had no place to go.  
We didn't k n ow what to take.  Shall we take
 clothes?  Shall we ta
ke dishes?  Linens?  
What do you take?  You know, 
we had no place to go.  So  my  sister just look a few 
pictures that she can still put in her pocke t, you know, little pictures, old pictures from 
my parents and the little one.  One of the babies 
that died, we had a picture.  He has them 
of us on it so I don't know if he came before or after.  And sh e took my  mo ther's  wedding 

ring and I think a necklace with, like, a watch 
on it.  She took a few things.  That's not 
mu ch.  A small suitcase we took.  Change of 
clothing.  And that's all.  What could we 
take?  We had furniture.  We had dishes.  Li
nens.  We had my mother's trousseau.  Every 
single -- there was her name engraved.  
We had to leave everything behind. 
 
Q: And where did you go? 
 
A: We had no place to go.  We 
were out in the street.  B u t 
then we met someb o dy that 
knew my  father but I didn't even know the man 
that well.  It was a G erman Jew but he 
was married to a Gentile German lady. 
 
Q: Do you reme mb er his name? 
 
A: Yes.  Albert Brusch and her name was He
rta or BerthA:  I don't know.  But anyhow -- 
but he lived way across town .  We were northea st in Berlin and he was, like, on the east 
side.  You had to take one or tw
o trains to go there.  So he met us and he said, what you 
two girls doing in this cold we
ather out in the street with th
e suitcase?  So I said, they 
threw us out from the apartment.  He said
, I know your mo ther was sick and she passed 
away.  What happened to your da
d?  I said, he died ju st a few months ago.  Well, didn't 

you have an  older brother?  I said, yeah, but 
they took him away.  He said, oh, my God.  
He says, no wonder my hair is gray.  He wa
s 64 years old.  So he
 says, what is this 
country coming to?  He was a German Jew but 
he did not practice Juda
ism.  He was just 
a German citizen.  He fought in the first Wo
rld War in the German Army.  And he was, 
like, a real German citizen. 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
 

A: But he still considered a Jew by the Nazis.
  No matter how many 
generations.  So he 
said, well, I have only  a one-bed room apartment,
 but if you want to sleep in the bathroom 
you're welcome.  I said , thank 
you.  Thank you.  So he took 
us to his house and my  sister 
slept in the bathtub and he put 
up a folding bed next to the 
bathtub and I slept on this.  
And his wife was so wonderful.  She welcomed
 us with open arms.  
She said, I 'm so sorry 
what this is coming to.  She didn't approve
, but she had no choice.  And she cooked for 
us.  First time we had a hot meal and actu
ally  a bed to  sleep in, if you call it a bed. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: But was a roof over your
 head, like my father said. 
 
Q: So had you spen t several da
ys outside on the streets or 
was it the first day that you 
left?  Did you have to  spend some days on 
the street, like, sleep on the street nights? 
 
A: It was cold.  It was very dangerous until 
that man took us.  Well, anyhow, we were 
there for a while and she was very nice to us
.  She says, oh, my Go
d, you girls have no 
clothes to wear.  Would you believe she took 
me to a store and bought me clothes and my  
sister?  She said, I'm so sorry. 
 And he said, I would love to adopt you tw o.  We have no 
children.  I would love to ha
ve ad opt you both, but there's 
no future for you here.  She 
was so wonderful to us. 
 
Q: Where they well-off or...  
 
A: Yeah.  I mean, they had a car.  In those da
ys very few people had a car.  He had a little 

busin ess.  And, yeah , I mean, I'm not sayi
ng how rich they we
re but they had an 
apartment, one bedroom, a livi
ng room, dining room, you know.
  They were not poor, but 
I wouldn't say they were rich
, but they were comfortable. 
 And -- but before we turned 
around it was December and it was Christmas 
and the doorbell rang.  When sh e opened 
the door her brother was there in an SS unifor
m, younger brother.  So he wanted to spen d 
Christmas Eve with them.  He was probably 
stationed nearby and he needed a place to 
spend the evening.  So they 
went into the dining room and he was -- she says, quickly, 
quick go to the bathroom.  Lock
 th e door.  Don't make a light
.  Don't even breathe.  She 
was so afraid of him.  So he went in and 
he was drinking and drin
king and singing all the 
German songs.  Oh   salute, you know.  A
nd he mu st have been so  drunk.  He was 
singing.  I could hear it.  I was so scared in th
at bathroom with my sist
er.  It was so dark.  
We couldn 't see each other even.  And I said
, isn't he ever going to leave?  Finally, he 
said, okay.  Okay  -- in German, of course, he's going.  I said, thank God.  All of a sudden 
he said, okay.  Okay.  One mo
re for the road.  An
d back to the  another drink, another 
drink.  She wanted to  get rid of him already. 
 Finally, he left.  She 
knocked on the door of 
the bathro om.  She said, okay.  Girls, you ca
n come out now.  We 
opened the door, we 
couldn't see a thing because we
 had been so many hours in 
the dark.  No window, no 
light.  I felt like blinded until 
I could open my eyes.  So she 
says, I'm so sorry.  I don 't 

know if I can keep you any longer.  My brot
her could co me anytime unexpected.  I mean, 
I understood this, but what co
uld I do?  Ag ain, we were on th e go.  But he said, don't 
worry.  I made an application for both of y
ou for the Kindertransport.  He says that I 
heard that England opened 
up visas.  He told us this at th
e beginning wh en we first came.  
I forgot about this.  So he says, England op
ened up visas for 10,0
00 children up to 16.  
And I was 14 and my sister was 16.  16 she c
ould still go.  So he sa
ys, and I'm sure you 
will both qualify, you're
 orphans, you're homele
ss, they should take 
you first, right?  But 
anyhow from the time he made th
e application and he says -- 
well, when we had to leave 
there he didn't throw us out, but we had to go
.  What about if her brother comes back and 
sees us there?  So, again, we 
had to go.  Whoever took us in
.  So then he says, well, I'm 
sure it will soon come through.  You'll be 
going to England very 
soon.  Wouldn't take 
long.  But do you know how long 
it took?  Nine months.  Next
 year we first had the apply 
-- the letter in July.  I can go
 to England but my  sister's  birthday was in May.  She was 
two months too old.  If you 
would have gotten it in May sh
e could go.  But she was two 
months too old.  They came in
 July and they  gave you a wh
ole list what I could take.  
Only  two pairs of shoes, two pairs of this.  Y
ou know, all this.  No jewelry.  No nothing.  
So I was getting ready for July 
to go.  Everything happened 
on a Friday.  My  mo ther died 
on a Friday, my father died on 
a Friday, my brother was deport
ed on a Friday
.  I came to 
England on a Friday.  I don't know what's wi
th Friday.  The Kindertransport was on a 
Friday too.  Well, anyhow, so on th e day wh en I -- 
 
Q: So -- I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 But you said it was after you le
ft, after he told you -- they 
told you to leave, 
where did you go?  
 
A: Well, somebody took us in one
 night here and one 
night there.  It was difficult.  You 
know, because it wasn 't my life 
I was afraid.  I was afraid of
 their life.  They're going to 
get into trouble.  I'
m in trouble already. 
 
Q: But who were the people who were taking you in?  Were they -- 
 
A: Well, one of them actually was a Jewish 
woman with two teenage girls.  Her husband 
was also deported at the same  time so he mu
st have been Polish.  So she took the two 
girls into her bedroom and she gave us -- she re
nted us the girls' bedroom for a while.  So 
we paid her rent.  As I said, my father 
put away a little money and this we took, of 
course.  So we paid her. 
 
Q: Do you reme mb er her name? 
 
A: No.  I don't think I ever ev
en knew her name.  All I know is
 the girls were teenagers.  
Like 17 and 18 or 19.  And 
that's why they were so much
 older than we were.  They 
called me a baby.  I said, I'm a teenager too.
  But you know, 14 and 18 and 17 is not the 
same. 
 

Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Well, anyhow, so at least we had a roof ov
er our head.  But I hated that place.  Well, 
anyhow, so when the day came for 
me to leav e, my sister took 
me to the station.  And this 
man, Albert Brusch, you know, the one wh ere we
 stayed, the two of them took me to the 
station.  When I came to the station and I lo
oked down the platform
 -- oh, my God, there 
were so ma ny people, children and mo stly wo ma
n.  There was an ocean of people crying 
and ev erything.  Those mo thers took th eir ch
ildren to the train sending th em to England 
on th e Kindertransport knowing that they maybe
 never see them again.  They didn't know 
if they 're going to survive or 
what.  So I'm telling you, it was te
rrible.  But when my sister 
couldn't go they told  her that she could make an
 application for domes
tic service.  So she 
had no choice.  So she did make
 and we were hoping that sh
e would be able -- somebody 
would take her in as a maid, you know, because 
she had to have a visa, that was the mo st 
important thing.  So anyhow.  So -- but sh
e took me to the station and I was hoping, 
hoping, she'll come so on.  
You know, because it was easy 
because the English people 
were looking fo r cheap help, you know.  Becaus
e they didn't pay much.  It was just, like, 
room and board and so on.  Bu t she was over 
16, you know. So  anyhow.  So  then I came 
to the station.  I'm on the platform waiting for th
e train to come in.  I haven't been back to  
school or seen any of my  r
oommates since last year.  Sinc
e '38 I haven't been back to 
school since my  father died.  And this was 
already July  '39.  A
ll of a sudden somebody 
comes in back of me and hugs and kisses me
.  And sh e says, oh, I'm so happy you're 
going to  be on the same transport.  This is my  
Fritzi.  That's a girl that was in my class, 
but not just in my  class, she was eight 
years in my class fro
m kindergarten on. 
 
Q: What's  her name? 
 
A: Fritzi Hacker, H-a-c-a -- c-k-e-r.   
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: Fritzi is a German name.  But since kind
ergarten her mo ther used to bring her to 
school every single day.  And she used to 
pick her up.  And every mo rning she always 
had a kind word for me because she says, yo
ur mother doesn't bring you to school?  
Because I told her my 
mother is bedridden and she can't 
get out of bed.  So she was so 
sorry.  So ev ery day she always ask me, how 
is your mo ther doing?  And so on, you 
know.  She was very, very nice
.  But I didn't  know if they 
had any other children because 
I've never seen anybody else, only that one girl
.  I don't even know if she had a father or 
not.  {Undetermined interruption} It's okay.  
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So -- so when I saw her at
 the -- until the end, she was 
already 12, 13, 14 -- almost 14 
years old.  She still brought her every morning 
to school and picked her up every day like 

a baby.  So when I saw her at the station bri
nging her to send her to 
England, I thought to 
my self how can this woman bring the girl kn
owing th at she may never see her again that 
she was so attached, you know. 
 So then I said to myself, 
oh, my  God, am I glad my  
parents are dead.  I didn't have to say good
bye to them.  I didn 't
 lea v e anybody behind 
except my sister and I knew she made the app
lication.  She's going to come to England 
very soon. And then the train came 
and we got in.  We said goodbye. 
 
Q: To your sister and... 
 
A: Well, my sister, she made the application 
for domestic service.  A nd sh e came, like, 
three weeks -- she came three da
ys before the war broke out, the last minute.  But she had 
a very tough time.  She had to make all of 
the arrangements for herself.  And, you know, 
like -- not like me.  All we did -- we wore
 a name tag to know
 who you are, but 
everything was arranged like the train.
  I went through Holland.  Yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember 
crossing the border? 
 
A: Yes.  Fritzi and I, we were
 sitting and we were looking 
out the window.  And on the 
other side were two little kids
, maybe seven, eight years old.  I didn't know them.  And 
we didn't even talk to
 them.  We were just talking to eac
h other.  I didn't see her in a year, 
you know, or any of my
 schoolmates.  So anyhow.  So, 
you know, in the 
city in Berlin 
there's only, like, big buildings, cement floors. 
 You don't see trees or grass or anything 
unless you go to  the park.  So as we were going , didn't take long, you're out of the city 
and you see the suburbs.  And there was gras
s and trees, little houses.  So Fritzi said to 

me, isn't it like you're going on a field trip
 from school and tonight we'll be back home in 

our house with parents -- with our parents?  So
 I said to -- I thought to myself, well, she 
still had a home to go to and a mother but I didn't.
  But I didn't  want to make her feel bad 
so I just nodded my  head.  I said, uh-huh, uh-
huh, like this. And then  as we were going, 
all of a sudden the train stopped.  I said, 
what happened ?  Looked out the window and I 
saw the Gestapo outside.  I said uh-oh.  No
w they'r e going to  come and take us off the 
train.  And I was scared like anything.  Bu t 
I didn't  realize -- I forgot we were going 
through Holland.  So then I rea
lized this must be the border 
because they came on.  It was 
a border crossing.  So  they had to come on 
and look at your pass
port.  So he says, 
passports, passports.  You know, 
young guys in Nazi uniform. 
 So I got up and I took my  
little suitcase down.  So you know 
what he said?  Forget about it.
  He didn't want to look.  
I could have taken anything w
ith me.  I was like -- but my 
sister was, like, she t o ok 
everything.  Boy, what they did to her.  We
ll, anyhow.  We crossed the border.  It took 
15, 20 minutes we cross the border.  I said, th
ank God I'm out of Germany.  Now I don't  
have to worry anymore once you'r e out of th
e country.  Bu t we were going fo r a while 
and all of a sudden th e train stopped again.  
I said, what?  Another border from Holland?  
We're going straight through th e channel.  But when I looked up there was no Gestapo 
outside.  They were Dutch wo men 
with baskets of food.  I still 
cry when  I hear about this.  

I got a tissue, you know.  So th ey knew th
e children were coming so they brought us 
refreshments.  Wasn 't that wonder -- perfect st
rangers they came on the train.  Wasn 't that 
something?  I never forget this
. And then we traveled
 to Holland until the 
rest of the day.  
About 10 o'clock we got off 
the train that day.  And we were by the -- by the British 
channel.  And then they lined
 us up, make sure everybody 
was -- I t h ink there were 300 
children on that train from th
e connection spot.  And they  said, well, I want everybody to  
go straight to the cabin where they're assigne
d to.  And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock 
we got there.  The boat is not going to st
art going until 12.  But don't wait for 12 o'clock 
because six o 'clock in the morning if you're g o
ing to be in Harwich 
and you have to be 
packed and upstairs ready to go
.  So go right to bed.  Do
n't wait for 12 o'clock until the 
boat leaves. And when we got on
 the boat, Fritzi and I, we shared a cabin.  So they had a 
bunk and a top one.  We had to toss a coin, 
which one gets the top and which one gets the 
botto m.  That was so cute, you know.  We we
re just kids.  And anyhow she slept on the 
top. And as we went to bed sh
e kept talking.  She says, are 
you sleeping?  I said, how can 
I sleep when you 're talking to me?  You know
, we're just talking lik
e kids.  Teenagers, 
early teens, you know.  So 
anyhow.  So all of a sudden after a while the boat started 
rocking.  Uh -oh, it mu st be 12 o'clock becaus
e the boat starting going.  He said 12 o'clock 
it's going to start.  So it mu
st be two hours already.  Better go to sleep.  Six o'clock we 
have to be upstairs.  So we
 mu st have fallen asleep or something.  And then  in the 
morning we got up and we were in Harwich. 
 And from there we took
 a train to London.  
It took two hours.  And then when we got to London th ere wa
s, like, a big room, a little 
bigger than this maybe.  A little w ider.  And 
there was, like, a be
nch here and a bench 
there and there.  And we were sitting on 
those benches and some people came and th ey 
called out names.  You go with this person.
  You go with -- nobody knew where they 
were going. I had no address and 
I still like to look for this 
girl.  I wish I knew if she's 
alive, if she's in England or some place else
.  I never saw her since that day.  Because I 
didn't  know where I was going and she 
didn't know where 
she was going.   
 
Q: And you never -- never saw her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never could find her? 
 
A: No.  No.  That's a shame. 
 I didn't -- I have -- contact -- 
 
Q: Like you don't want to talk about it -- 
 
A: Anyhow I came  to England on a Friday.  An
d -- and that week I came to a couple, an 
elderly couple, I mean, old enough to be my
 parents.  They had married children and 
grandchildren.  And I met the family over the weekend. 
 
Q: Was it in London? 
 

A: In London, yeah.  I met th
e family over -- they had a marri
ed son, two or three kids; 
and a married daughter with some children.  
And then the youngest daughter was, like, in 
her 20s.  And sh e was -- I didn't even know at
 the time she was expecting her first baby.  
But it wasn't hardly to see.  And at that tim
e I didn't  even know 
where the babies came 
from.  Now, I do. Anyhow.  So
 -- so on the weekend I met th
em and then on -- she says 
to me, well, what are you goin
g to do with yourself?  You kno
w, it was July.  The schools 
were closed.  So sh e said, well, when the sch
ools open  in September, we going to register 
you for school.  So in the meantime what ar
e you going to  do with  yourself?  And th ey 
had their own -- like, a little factory.  They
 were making civilian trousers for men. So 
Monday mo rning th e younger daughter that was 
working in that place for her father, you 
know, there were a few people there.  They 
were, like, a few men and one woman.  They 
were in their 50s or 60s, you know.  Like, fo
ur or five men and one woman was right on 
the corner.  She was, lik
e, 64.  They were very nice to 
me.  But they spoke Yiddish.  I 
couldn't speak any English.  So
 th ey spoke Yiddish to me.  
I understood but I didn't speak 
it that good.  But it's  very si
milar to German.  So I knew wh
at they were saying. So she 
introduced me to ever
ybody and she showed me
 what to do.  How to use this machine 
and this machine.  A few machines she taught 
me at my  age, you know.  I never work ed.  
I had to sew the buttons with 
the machine.  And if you do
n't put it exactly in and the 
needle went next to the hole, 
you break the needles.  I must 
have broke a dozen need les.  
It was very hard to get it the right way.  And 
she was so fast because she 's been used to it, 
you know.  And then  there wa
s another machine that made the hems and another machine 
for the buttonholes.  I had to
 work all three machines, a
nd make tea twice a day for 
everybody who was there.  I still hate teA:  
It reminds me. So anyhow I was working with 
her and sh e used to take me th
ere in the morning.  I think 
we went by bus.  And th en I 
came home in the evening.  And before I had 
dinner she used to sa
y to me -- there was 
only her and her husband living there -- she sa
id, while the dinner is -- while you're 
waiting you can wash this floor.  She made 
me do the housework before -- after a whole 
day in th e factory. Well, anyhow -- but then
 this was going on for quite a few months.  
September came around.  I forgot about it 
school.  You know, and nobody mentioned a 
word .  And I was just work in
g, wo rking ev ery day.  But then she was getting ready to 
have her baby.  And her name was Fannie.  
And so  she says, well -- when  she couldn't go 
to wo rk anymore I was on my  own.  And then  a
ll the work wh at the two of us did I had to 
do my self.  So instead of going at nine o'cl
ock in the morning I ha
d to go eight o'clock 
and seven o'clock.  And 
instead of staying until five or 
six, I used to stay until seven, 
eight o'clock.  Five days, si
x days, seven days a week, I c
ouldn't keep up.  And I don't 
know what happened. 
 One day I rememb er I was going to  the bus and th e bus ride was 
tuppence. Know anything about English money? 
 Tuppence is like 20 cents.  So she used 
to give me the tuppence.  But 
then she found out they  have 
-- what is this -- you know, if 
you come until 7:30 -- before 7:30
 in the morning you get a retu
rn ticket.  So if you give 
them tuppence and a half, Ha'p
enny, you get a ticket to go ba
ck  at night. So  she says, 

make sure you get the bus before 7:30.  
And she gave me tuppence and a half, the 
Ha'p enny.  And that's all the money I had.
  I never had pocket money or wages or 
anything, only fo od and sleep, lodging. So  
I tried to get the bus -- every time I came to 
the bus, there was a lin e from here to God kn
ows wh ere.  All these big guys waiting for 
the bus.  They probably had families to supp
ort.  They saw me, they said, that kid's 
probably  wo rking fo r pocket mo ney and they us
ed to push me on the side and get on th e 
bus.  And I tried to get on th e bus but I couldn
't push those guys away.  I was trying to get 
very hard.  If I was lucky I 
got on it and I had my  ticket to go back  home.  But I 
reme mb er one day I tried so hard and they  
pushed me on the side.  And -- there be 
another bus in a minute.  Half a minute la
ter the bus came, no more return. What I'm 
going to  do?  I had to give them the tuppen ce
 and I had a Ha'p enny left.  I came to the 

place and I was crying.  So the woman that wa
s working, the one woma
n, she says to me, 
what's the matter, Puppala?  Pu
ppala means little doll.  Why ar
e you crying?  So I said, I 
missed the return bus th
is morning.  So sh e said, big deal. 
 So you're five minutes late?  I 
said, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not I'm late, I 
have no money to go 
back home.  She said, 
what it is tuppence?  Big deal.  Here's tuppence.
  And I made a Ha'p enny that day.  That's 
the first money I ever had of my
 own.  Isn't that something?  I cried because I didn't  make 
the return bus.  But I didn't tell her that. 
 
Q: So you were living with her too? 
 
A: I was living -- no, not the woman that worked there.  
 
Q: Or with the family?
 
A: She was home.  Sh
e didn't work there.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: There was people wo rking fo r them. Well,
 anyhow.  And th en an other day I was 
standing in line again waiting 
for the bus.  I mean, every mo rning I was standing in  line 
waiting for the bus.  I tried to get on this as
 mu ch as I could.  But I don't know what 
happened that morning.  All 
of a sudden I remember standi
ng in line waiting for the bus, 
but I have no id ea what happened.  All of a sudd
en I wake up, I'm in 
the hospital.  I have 
know idea how I got there. 
 
Q: And what happened?  
 
A: And I'm laying on th
e bed or stretcher and the young
 doctor bending over me  and 
talking to  me.  I couldn't understand a wo rd he
 was saying because I didn't go to school.  
Nobody spoke English to me.  I was already, 
like, a half a year in England.  If I go to 
school I would have 
spoken -- or people speak to you 
I would know a little
 English, but 
nobody spoke English to me.  
I didn't go to school so I didn'
t know any Englis
h.  And he 
was talking and talking.  I didn't know wh at 
he was saying.  So he
 didn't know what to do 

with me.  Couldn't even tell me how I feel, 
why I -- I don't know what happened.  I didn't 
even remember fainting or anything.  All I 
remember is -- was I was hot.  It was just 
before Christmas.  This I rememb er because Fa
ther Christmas came.  
Ho.  Ho.  Ho.  Ho.  
That's  how I remember what tim
e of the year it was. So he didn't know wh at to do with 
me so they put me in a big room like a ward
 with about eight or 10 people, woman, there 
all the way in the corner on one bed and 
they  called somebody from the Bloomsbury 
House.  That's the organization that was re
sp onsible for the child
ren, Kindertransport 
children. So after a while a Ms. Feldman cam
e to me see me and 
she spoke to me in 
German.  And sh e says to me, how come yo
u don't speak any Eng
lish?  You're here 
already a long time.  I mean, half a year is a 
long time to learn English, right?  At least a 
few words.  So I said, nobody 
speaks English to me, how can 
I learn?  So she said, well, 
don't you go to school?  I said, oh, my  God, sc
hool.  I forgot what school is such a long 
time.  Like, a year and a half I haven't been
 in school.  So she says, what are you doing 
with yourself all day long if you don't go to school
?  So I said, well, I wo
rk in  the factory.  
She says, well, do you have a permit?  I said, 
what's that?  I don't know wh at a permit is.  
So she said, well, whenever we came we 
check up on our child
ren and when ever we 
came to your house the lady always said, she'
s in school.  And wh en they came on th e 
weekend I was never there.  She's out with a 
friend.  They probably went to a movie or 
something.  Because I was neve
r there whenever they
 came to check up 
on me.  So they 
wouldn't let me go back .  And they  had no pl
ace where to send me.  So I had to stay in 
the hospital until they 
found a place for me. 
 
Q: How long was that?  
 
A: I know it was after Christmas because 
I know he came -- you know, Santa Clause 
came.  They call him Father Ch
ristma s.  And they gave every wo man a bed jacket.  All 
different colors.  And he came  to me he says
,  oh, you're  the youngest one here.  You're so 

pure so I'm giving you a white 
one so to put on the shoulde
r.  You know, to put on your 
arms because they don't have heat
 there.  Not at this time an
yhow.  So it's like to put on 
the bed when you sit up in bed, you know.  
 
So there was nothing wron
g with me.  I must have just ha
d a little cold or something.  I 
have -- maybe somebody put -- I have no id
ea what happened.  Ho w I was -- how I end 
up in the hospital. 
 
Q: Yeah, well, you probably  were exhausted.  
 
A: I don't even remember -- I don't remember 
falling or fainting or anything.  But they 
mu st have picked me up and take me.  I don'
t reme mb er it.  All I rememb er I'm opening 

up my  ey es and that doctor is st
anding over me and talking to
 me and I didn't know wh at 
he was talking about.  But I know I was hot. 
 
Q: So what happen
ed then when -- 
 

A: Well, then she says to me, well, we do
n't have anybody that can take you unless you 
want to go to a hostile.  I said, I d on't know wh
at a hostile is.  And I don't -- I was just 
scared.  I w as afraid to go anywhere because the way I felt already.  I was afraid  of 
everybody.  So do you have anybo
dy here?  I said, all I k n ow is I have a sister here but I 
don't even know where she is
.  S h e -- she's working for so
mebody.  She same  here on 
domestic service.  And 
you know when  they  -- 
 
Q: How did you hear th at she arrived?  
 
A: Huh?  
 
Q: How did you hear -- how did you learn th
at she arrived in England?  Were you -- 
 
A: Oh, yeah, I know
 when she arrived, she wrote to me. 
 
Q: Oh, you were -- 
 
A: So I saw her but she had to go to the pe
ople that vouch for her.  And one weekend I 
even went to visit her for one night. 
 
Q: Where -- where was it?  
 
A: It was far away.  It took a couple of hour
s to get there.  But th
at one weekend when I 
did go, I went on a Saturday  afternoon and I ca
me back Sunday in th
e evening.  That was 
probably  before I work ed day and night, you know. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 
A: And the daughter was still 
working there at the beginni
ng because she came -- the 
very last day of August '39.  
Just three days before the war 
broke out.  So the daughter 
was still w o rking with me.  So I went on a Satu
rday afternoon.  So before I went on that 
bus, I had to go to the police station and ge
t a special permit to 
spend one night at a 
different address because I was co nsidered an enemy alien. 
 
Q: Oh.  
 
A: So -- so that's all.  S o  
I had th e permit and I went there and I got there Saturd ay in th e 
evening late.  And I slept over in her roomand th en Sunday afternoon.  Bu t that's the 
only time I saw her.  And when  she came, we pi
cked her up from the st
ation.  So I saw -- 
 
Q: Oh, you did? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Who went with you to pick her up? 
 
A: I guess the lady must have.  I said, my sist
er is comin g .  Well, anyhow -- so -- but she 
had -- 
 

Q: So what was the 
lady's name?  Sorry.  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: But -- so my sister had to 
go right away  there.  But the people vouch fo r her and they  
were waiting for her.  So that one night I sp
ent one weekend there.  And then the war 
broke out soon after this, three days later.  
But at the beginning you heard bombings and -
- but it wasn't too bad.  But later on it got ve
ry bad.  Bombs were coming down one after 
the other.  You heard about the Blitz of London?  
 
Q: Yes.  Sure.  
 
A: It was real bad.  So all of the childre
n were evacuated to th
e country.  Because in 
London it was bad because there 
were factories and they tried to bomb all these things.  
And I lived in London.  But th
e people my  sister was staying with -- I don't know if they 
had a place in the country or they rented, I do
n't know.  But they  couldn't  take the bomb s 
going ev ery night to th e shelter.  Because I di
dn't even know what it was like to sleep in a 
bed anymore.  For three years, four years, you
 know, I haven't slept in the bed.  So they  
went to the country and they to ok her along.
  So I -- then I couldn 't  see her at all 
anymore.  So I -- I don't know 
if I knew any of this but I to
ld this Ms. Feldman and they 
mu st have made the arrangements.  So anyhow. 
 So my sister wrote a letter to me to the 
hospital.  And th ey wouldn't  let me out of 
the hospital.  And Ms. 
Feldman said, the only 
way we can release her is if a 
person th at's already of age. 
 Well, she was old already.  
She was -- what is age?  17?  18?  
 
Q: 18.  
 
A: 18.  So maybe she's mu st have been, yeah, 
she mu st have been 18.
  So she says, well, 
how can I come to London and st
ay with you?  See, first of 
all, the bombs and all this is 
bad, but I have no choice you'
re there too.  I was sleeping with th e bombs ev ery night.  
But wh at am I going to  do?  I have no occ
upation.  The only thing I know is cleaning 
houses.  That's the only thing I know.  That's 
what she came there for.  Domestic service.  
So I said, but I know how to 
work.  I work all three mach in
es, four machines, and I know 
-- and I can do -- so she says, but how am I going
 to make a living?  I said, don't worry.  I 
know how to work.  I'll
 teach you.  So that's  the only wa y they'll let me out. So she had to 
come to London.  Take a risk being in London 
under the Blitz instead of being safe in the 
country.  And so  we rented a room and Ms. Fe
ldman helped us a lot.  She says, as long as 
you're in this country  you're my  child no ma
tter how old you are. So -- but my  sister from 
working all this -- they didn't have mops.  Sh
e had to go on her knees and clean the floor.  
Her knees were all sw ollen, full of pus. 
 
Q: Oh, no.  
 

A: She was in terrible shape. 
 A young girl, you know.  But 
we rented a room.  I think it 
was, like, five shilling.  It was very cheap. 
 And she got us a job in a war factory to do 
something, something with ma
chines.  And I had to sh ow 
her how to work.  And we 
made a living. And, you know, the room was very
 cheap.  It wasn 't  
mu ch of a room.  You 
come up the stairs.  There's was one little room
.  There was a little bed in there, and on 
the landing was a sink about that size, and a li ttle gas ring.  That was our kitchen.  And 
the bathro om was an outhouse in th e back. 
 
Q: Well, it still had a roof -- 
 
A: Yeah, I had a roof over my  
head.  So we work ed an d we
 supported ourselves.  So 
that's about it.  But at leas
t I was with my  sister. And, 
eventually, we picked up, you 
know -- when you work, 
you work  with English people.  
I hear them talking.  I never 
even heard -- we had no television at that 
time.  Didn't h ave time to watch it anyhow, I 
was never home.  And so I picked up -- it was easie
r to listen than to speak.  I was afraid 
to open my mouth in case it doesn't come out
 right.  But I could u
nderstand already when  
they were talking to me.  There was an En
glish lady sitting right 
next to me, she was 
about 45 years old.  Because it was an old la
dy to me, you know, I was still a teenager.  
And she was very nice and she helped me a lot e
xplaining me what to do and this is this 
and this is that.  She spoke to me English,
 you know.  Sh e didn't know German. And one 
day she came in and she said, oh, we had a lo
t of bombs last night.  And they got bombed 
out the whole house went down .  Sh e was livi
ng with her elderly parents.  And I said, 
where are you going to live now?  So she says
, well, they have the prefabricated houses.  
They put them up in one day.  I said, really? 
 You know, she was very nice.  English lady.  
And so she says, I'll take you 
to  my  house and in troduce yo
u to my  parents.  And she 
took me over there and they had a beautiful
 living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a 
bathroom.  It was gorgeous.  On e day they  put 
up prefab ricated house.  I said, it's a lot 
nicer than mine.  But I wasn 't jealous.  I 
was happy.  I had a roof over my  head . 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Yeah.  It was tough.  But God was with 
me all the time.  When
 they came to the 
shelter they gave out little cards and I still have 
it in my pocketbook.  
I keep it with me all 
the time.  It's a little ca
rd that said, God is your refuge.  
Don't be afraid.  He'll be with you 
all through the raid.  When bombs are droppi
ng and danger is near, He'll be with you 
until the all clear.  And I still have it in my po
cketbook.  I take it with me wherever I go. 
 
Q: And did it help? 
 
A: And He was with me.  Because one nigh
t I came home from the -- from work.  I was 
so tired.  We had to be there at 7:30 in 
the morning and we work
ed until 6:30 at night. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  
 

A: So I was really -- I was dropping.
