swimming pool, a s Œ pool that was donated to the city of

 taking walk s and hike
s, and we used to 
go Œ when Œ 
Ma nnheim  
is located about half an 
hour™s by train or car from 
Heidelberg
, we used to go to the

Q: 11 schools. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So, what about th e first Œ th
e first schools that you went to? 
A: Was a Œ was a normal public school in 
Germ any
. In fact, interesting, I met a guy 
upstairs yesterday who went to
 the same school the same 
year. We started here the 
same year, or he started one year later. 

Q: Did you remember each ot
her, did you recognize him? 
A: No, no. But we just recognized the to
wn , and we found out we had some common 
friends. 

Q: Oh. So did your family prac
tice their religion at all?

d you have both Jewi
sh and non-Jewish 
friends?

ce anti-Semitism growing up? 
A: Yeah. Yeah, this was Œ 
as I di Œ I stayed in 
Germany
, let™s see, there were four, 
yeah, four grades of Œ of 
public school, grammar school. And then  I went for tw o 
years to German high school. And then ther
e were restrictions 
and getting to Œ and 
then my parents were in a position to send me to private boarding schools in 
Italy
; 
one on th e 
Riviera
, near 
Portofino
, apart Œ over that area. And th e second one was

near 
Merano
, in the 
Dolo mites
, in the mountain areas. So
 nice. Stayed there from 
about April ™37, til Œ I can give you 
the exact date, September thirt Œ 30
th
, 1938. 
That™s it. September has 30 days or 31? 
Q: I don™t remember. 
A: No, August has 31, September has 30, Se
ptember 30. And then  I went by train ba 
Œ the school had to close. Somehow thar Œ 
Mussolini 
got Œ close it togeth er Œ and I 
took the train from northern 
Italy
, over the 
Brenner Pass
 into 
Munich
 and back 
into 
Ma nnheim
, wh ere my  parents were living. And th at was Œ on the train I found 
every town, every station ha
d a lot flags out. Why? Because they saw me going Œ no, 
there was somebody else who took th
e same train ride, the same day. 
[indecipherable]
 Yo u™re not a history major, are you? 
Q: I am. I™m going to let 
you an swer this. Who was it? 
A: Well, check the dates. September 30
th
. 
Q: Mm-hm. Was it
 Hitler
? 
A: I was going to 
Munich
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: What happened on
 October first in 
Munich
? 
Q: 
Hitler
 was doing so mething. 
A: The 
Munich 
Conference. 
Q: Oh, okay.

A: That™s the one where 
Chamberlain
 was fooled  by 
Hitler
, that h e™s for peace. 
Q: Oh, mm-hm. 
A: That™s when 
Da ladier
 was there from 
France
, 
Chamberla in
 fro m 
England
, 
Mussolini
 and 
Hitler
. And they met, and that was, as 
far as I™m concerned, th e start, 
the prelude to World War II, 
because that™s when the Œ 
the British and the French 
said 
Hitler
 could annex
 Sudetenland
, which is the ethnically German part of 
Czechoslovakia
, which is the one that Œ and then 
a couple Œ not too long afterwards, 
Hitler
 annexed all of 
Czechoslovakia
, and renamed it 
Birman
(ph), which is the 
classy German name for that part of the country. 

Q: How Œ I™m going to back up just a little ab out that. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How old were you when  you
 first went to school in 
It a l y
? 
A: Let™s see, I went Œ I was not yet 12. Wa
s born in 30 Œ I was born in ™25, so Œ in 
June, and that was in April, ™37, so I 
was Œ I was nearly 12 years old, not quite. 
Q: Well, was it Œ was it Œ di-did 
your sisters go with you as well? 
A: No. 

Q: Was it difficult to leave Œ l
eave your family? Were you Œ 
A: No, at that time it w as Œ it was lot of go
od discipline. Before Œ wh en you went to 
the dining hall, they checked  your fingerna
ils, so make sure th
ey™re clean. They had 
somebody Œ some teacher there 
[indeciphera ble]
. And that was a very interesting

life, we experienced people from all over th
e world. They were not only Germans, 
they were also loyalists from 
Spain
 who were fleeing after the Spanish Œ during the 
Spanish Civil War, which was going on at th
at time. And th e school was very good, 
not too many studen ts there. The student to
 t-teacher ratio Œ ratio was good, and we 
got a lot of personal attention,
 and a lot of sports. We didn™t have that mu ch contact 
with the Italians, except we played soccer 
against them. But then, I went swimming, 
I even Œ that™s the first tim
e I did diving. There was har Œ hard hat diving, wh ich is 
hardly done any more. But 
in the bay, catching squids and stuff like that.  

Q: What language were Œ what language 
did you speak when  you were at school in 
Italy
? Was it German? 
A: There were different things. 
The primary language was German 
[indecipherable]
 
but everybody had to take Italian, and I wa
s reasonably fluent, and later on I went for 
a while to a German Œ to Italian public high 
school. And I had troubles with it, which 

I wasn™t that good. Then my fi
rst language before I went to 
Italy
 was French. And 
my mother was a expert in Œ in the Fren
ch language. In fact
, she used to tutor 
PhD
 
students in the States, who were prepari
ng for their language exam. You know, they 
had to pass a language exam if they took th e 
thing. And th e th Œ in teresting thing is, 
the school will send you right home twice 
a week, one postcard and one letter. And 
my mother insisted that the postcard be 
written in French. So it™s Œ and then at 

dinner, you were assig n ed to sit on different  tables, and at different tables, there was 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010

only a certain language spoken. So if you went 
this week to the French table, that™s Œ 
that was it. 

Q: The language you spoke. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So, did you Œ was 
it a positive experience? 
A: Yes. Oh well, tha Œ I mean, this is Œ th
ey were great in doing th ings like, we were 
harv Œ harvesting the seeds fro
m luk Œ eucalyptus trees, a
nd then  we learned how to  
distill and make eucalyptus oil from it. And 
we were Œ we Œ not only academically, 
also had to work , we Œ in
 the garden, we were harv
esting figs and oranges and 
lemons and Œ 
Q: So Œ 
A: My favorite thing was harvesting figs, because I liked them. Fresh ones. 

Q: Why did you leave? 

A: Pardon me? 
Q: What was the situation, why did you have to leave 
Italy
? 
A: That school? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Well, it was Œ these schools closed. First the school at the 
Mediterranean 
closed. 
I don™t know what the reason is they closed
, I don™t Œ but then they  moved so me of 
the kids into  a neighboring town , and a few of the teachers created their own

board ing school. Bu t we were
 actually staying in a 
pensionne
. And what Œ th ey had 
lessons, and we were located next to the 
Mediterranean
, we could go Œ the first 
kids to go sw imming, and see the fisherma
n coming in, and see 
them eat little fish, 
bian Œ biachettis
. They eat them all live. And Œ we
ll, you also can cook them, but 
when you cook them, the fish turns white, except the 
eyes, and the tail stays silver. 
And for beginners, you eat that with tomato
 sauce, but it tastes better with lemon. 
But then you see the eyes as 
you™re putting it in your mouth. 
Q: That sounds gross. 

A: Well, I™ve eaten Œ many years later I™v
e eaten something that was even more 
difficult to eat, and that was called  
balut
. I ate that in the 
Philippines
. That is the 
egg of a duck, soft boiled, 
about four days before the 
egg is hatched. And you eat 
everything except the beak, 
you use that to cl Œ to clean your teeth. 
Q: Gross. 

A: And when I was in the 
Philippines
 and wo rking th ere, wh
en Œ and we went out 
one ev ening Œ I mean, I™m going way back Œ 

Q: That™s okay. 

A: Œ way in 
[indecipherable]
 we went out with a couple of the other engineers, we 
went to places, and they Œ the last thing 
on the evening, they saved for me, is a 

balut
. 
Q: Were you surprised? Did you know what it was? 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
12
A: No, I didn™t know what it was. I think 
I heard about it lately, but I had a lot of 
beers with it, and just swallowe
d. But in th e next day, when
 I went back to the plant, 
it™s like having passed the initiation test. I wa
s not Œ not just a gringo, or whatever 
they call them ther
e. I was initiated Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ in their food, and I got 
better response from the work ers. 
Q: Good. 
A: They all knew about it. 
Q: So, when you left 
Italy
 in ™38 Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It was Sep-September first, you said? 
A: No, September 30
th
. 
Q: 30
th
. When Œ 
A: The conference was October first. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: The 
Munich 
Conference. 
Q: Where did you go from there? 
A: Well, I went for a short time back to 
Ma nn h e im
, and then I went to a Jewish 
board ing school in 
Germ any
, in 
Halingen
. That™s near 
Ulm
. And that was probably 
the biggest Jewish boarding school that was still remaining in 
Germ any
. And that

was closed, but 
[indecipherable]
 very long, except I think th
ey tortured us there, but 
that™s the teachers. Because 
every morning, before anythi
ng else, we had to run for 
about half an hour through the woods, h
illy and through the 
woods. There was a 
co mman d ,  
wald lauf
, which means wood Œ ru nning 
through the wood. And none of 
the guys, and there were Œ they always
 were may Œ everybody who went there 
remembered, that was the wo
rst command that was given th
ere. But then
 when that 
school closed after 
Kristallnacht
 Œ we did not expe
rience anything at 
Kristallnacht
, 
at that school, but it was closed afterwards. 
And th e different build ings were sold to 
various people. And the person who bought 
the boys™ dormitory was Field Marshal 
Rommel
. So I lived Œ I liv
ed in Œ slept in 
Rommel™s
 house before he did. 
Q: My goodness. So, after the school 
closed, where did you go to then? 
A: Well, I went for a short time back to 
Ma nn h e im
, there was a Je wish school there, 
and I went there for a couple of
 weeks, and then I went to 
Kind ertransport
. 
Q: So, where were your sisters during this time? 
A: Friend of our Œ that friends
 of ours took my sisters to 
Holland
, couple days after 
the 
Kristallnacht
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And they put them into pr
ivate families, and they were 
treated very well. The first 
one was manufacturers of a cheese Œ of a chee
se man Œ at a cheese factory in a town 
called 
Budehaven
(ph), which is in the Œ one 
of the bra-branches of the 
Rhine
, 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert

before it gets into the 
North Sea
. And Œ but then they  coul
dn™t stay there very  long 
because it™s Œ the wife got very ill and they
 couldn™t Œ they couldn™t do it any more. 
And then  they went to  another family, where the father was a diamond merchant. 
They lived in a tremen dously
 big house, and they sent
 their kids, including m-my  
sisters to the best school in 
Holland
, wh ich is the same  school that the present queen  
attended. Not at the same ti
me. S h e™s younger. But it™s the 
kind of a reputation of the 
Œ that time current princess was s-scheduled  
to go to that school an d it™s probably Œ 
it™s probably wa Œ th e best high sc Œ 
high school or something like this in
 Holland
. 
Because of that it got that royal ey Œ interjection. 
Q: Right. So  wh en you went from the board ing school in 
Germany
, back home, was 
Œ did your parents discuss with you th at 
you were going to be leaving on the 

Kindertransport? Li
ke did you know Œ 
A: Yeah, when we beca
me available, it was 
[indeciphera ble]
 short notice. It didn™t 
Œ I think it was in about January  ™39, or so
mething like that. No, 
and then my father 
was arrested and until then he could prac
tice because he was a wounded veteran of 
World War I. And th en he was put in 
Da cha u
 for a while. And then he was later 
released because he was able to 
get sponsorship by Œ by the Bishop of 
Litchfield
 in 
England
. A funny thing, on one of our trips, 
when  my  parents were visiting me up 
in 
Italy
, there was a lady staying in  the same hot
el as my  parents were staying, and 
they became friendly, and she was a se
cretary to the b Œ to the Bishop of 
Litchfield
,

and somehow my  mo th er contacted her and 
Œ wh ich they  could do and so th ere was 
a way, people Œ some adults could go ther
e, and he spent time 
til Œ he proba
bly went 
there in January or February ™39, 
and he stayed there til April ™40. 
Q: Okay . So, how lo ng was he in 
Dachau
? 
A: I don™t know, about three or four weeks? 
Q: Okay . So , wh en he came back, you Œ were you in 
Mannheim
? Or were you still 
at the school and Œ 
A: No, I was Œ I was in 
Holland
 already. 
Q: Oh, okay. So  wh at Œ wh at kind of things
 did you have to do to  prepare to leave? 
Like wh at kind of things di
d you pack, do you rememb er? 
A: No, it™s no different than going to a board ing school. 
Q: Right, I guess, yeah. 

A: I mean, I had my  experience, having been
 in four boarding schools; three Œ three 
in 
Italy
, and one in 
Germany
, and so I Œ I pretty well knew what was needed. 
Q: So you Œ did you feel 
Œ do you recall leaving your fa
mily? Was it differen t than 
the other times you had left for boarding schools? 

A: No. So th is was in the system. 
Q: Yeah. You took a train there, to 
Holland
? 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
16
A: Yeah. We first Œ they took it from 
Mannheim
, then  they had us stay overnight, 
either in 
Frankfurt
, or in 
Cologne
, I forgot. And they collected people from other 
locations, and th ey put them on a common train and to ok us into  
Rotterdam
. 
Q: Where did you go from 
Rotterdam
? 
A: Well, we first of all, I had Œ at 
Rotterdam
 we stayed for a wh
ile in the quarantine 
station. That happened to Œ every port at 
that time had a quarantine station. And Œ 
cause they didn™t know
 whether the sailors came back 
with tropical illn
esses or stuff 
like that. But there was a 
facility, was guarded by Du
tch military. We could not 
leave, but we could have visitors. For in
stance, my  sisters and theirs Œ and th eir 
foster parents, that cheese manufacturer, 
they came and visited me there. But we 
stayed in big barracks. There wasn™t much 
to do, but then  a short time afterwards, I 
was able to go do what is mi
spronounced in  the States 
as gouda, what should be 
pronounced 
howda
(ph). And th ere we were in a Œ in an  old orphanage, and in  that 
orphanage we also had quite 
a few refugee teachers. And si
nce the academic training 
some of the kids had, was quite different 
between them. And if you were, let™s say at 
Œ some more advanced training in language
s and literature and math or science, and 
you had the math teach er there, and you knew
 you were interested in that, he really 
spent a lot of time. But I must give cr
edit for being able to graduate from a 
U.S.
 high 
school on the week of my  16
th
 birthday, after having been
 in the country about 14 
months. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
17
Q: That™s pretty impressive. 
A: And I still had language 
problems with it, but Œ 
Q: What language did you 
speak when you were in 
Holland
? 
A: I think Œ well, among the kids where 
we were staying, there was primarily 
German, and the teachers, these w e
re all German speaking teachers. 
[indecipherable] 
it™s a mass instruction, only you
 had literature, you had German 
literature. Maybe a little Œ little 
English, or I don™t know, 
we spo Œ we learned some 
Dutch, we had some Dutch people coming in and Œ 
Q: But you lived primarily w
ith other German children? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . How lo ng were you in 
Holland
? 
A: Well, from about January ™39 til April ™40.
 And I was in Œ after about Œ I was for 
a short time in 
Amsterdam
, wh ich was also a quarantine station, it was a holding 
place. And they did a few things Œ for inst
ance, I learned glass blowing there. But 
very primitive, I mean, the 
very beginnings of it. But 
they kept Œ th ey had some 
vocational instructors. And then I went to 
Wieringen
. No w th at is a important place. 
It is what used to be known as an 
aliyah
 ca Œ preparation camp. Familiar with it? 
Q: Mm-mm. 
A: For Œ the term? 

Q: Mm-mm, no. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
18
A: 
Aliyah
. That is the mo  Œ Zionist moveme nt
 to go Œ preparing you to go to 
Isr a e l
. 
So we had academic traini
ng, and we had agricultura
l training, and vocational 
training. And th is is the first time I was 
involved with oil and gas, because we f Œ 
they found out the thing is, for the traini
ng, this Œ that was in the place of the 
Zu i d e r z e e
, which had been reclaimed from the 
sea, that land. Bu t you had swamp 
gas coming up through the water. And we 
collected the swamp gas and f Œ and had 
the equipment, that it could be used pr
oductively for heating and ag ricultural and 
cooking things. And this is not in
 the area of Œ farther east in 
Groningen
, where they 
discovered afterward were two Œ some very 
big gas fields. But this is probably not 
related. I never heard of this, what we 
found there, because 
it was only bubbling up. 
And we had a container that collected it, a
nd so we Œ they had Œ we built, and then 
we did agricultural things. For instance, it™
s interesting using th
at kind of a country 
place to prepare people for 
Israel
, where this was too much
 water, as compared to 
Israel
 having lack of water. But th
ey Œ they built that partic
ular facility there, and it 
was a productive fa-farm. I thi
nk they produced or Œ everything was consumed that 
was produced. They raised all kind of big animals. 

Q: Were you in contact with your 
family at this Œ at this time? 
A: Yes.  
Q: Were they in
 Eng land
?

A: No, my mother was in 
Germany
. Sh e did not go to 
England
 because her parents 
were too old to go to 
England
. 
Q: But your father was in 
England
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Wha-Wh at was your Œ tell me  about your mo ther. 

A: Well, my mother was born in 
Berlin
, but her parents moved to  
Mannheim
 when  
they retired, when they got 
old enough, they needed  some
body, one of their children 
to Œ when the mother Œ my 
mo ther, taking care of the thing. And th en she is Œ was 
academically trained, she never got her fu
ll degree, but she couldn™t make up her 
mind whether to study law or medicine. She 
did some of each, but never finished it Œ 
it, and after Œ wh en the war had started, and after 
Paris
 had fallen, and th e 
Vichy 
government was established, they
 made that province, which was 
Baden
, which is 
where 
Ma nnheim
, 
Heidelberg
 ar-are located, they made it 
Judenfrei
. Free of Jews, 
and they  de-deported all of them
 to a concentration camp in the 
Pyrenees 
called 
conda Œ called 
Gurs
, 
g-u-r-s
. You heard about that one? 
Q: Yeah, I know that one. 

A: Okay . 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Gurs
.
 
Actually the Œ the 
S
 is not pronounced  in Œ in the 
French thing, and she stayed  there for a while, together 
with her mother. Her father 
did not surv ive the transport. And Œ yeah. Th
ey lived pretty well 
in the mud. These Œ 
this was built for Spanish l
oyalists who fled across from 
Spain
 to the French border,

when  they  were being defeated. And so  it didn™t have too many comfort, it was for 
young military people, but there was Œ fo
od was somewhat limited. But since my 
mother was fluent in French
, she was part of the delegation that went to local 
farmers and try Œ tried to talk them out of
 more food, and stu
ff like that. And then 
she and her mother were transferred to 
Marseilles
, and my  mo ther had a vi-v isa to 
go to the States also. Otherw
i Œ in the meantime, lotsa th
ing; I had been Œ we had 
been in the States. I went from 
Holland
, picked up Œ we picked
 up my f Œ my sister s 
and I, we picked up my father in 
Southampton
, and went to the States. And then  we 
lived in 
New York
 for a while. But then
 my  mo th er was in  
Marseilles
, and she was 
able to catch a boat, a Fren
ch boat that was going to 
Martinique
, which is the Œ one 
of the French states or 
provinces. And Œ but since
 France
, 
Vichy
,
 France
 was at war 
with 
Eng land
, a British warship captured that
 ship and brought it into 
Trinidad
. So 
they were interned as, I guess enemy aliens in 
Trinidad
. But then from there we 
were in contact with her in the States, we 
were able to get arrangements to get a boat 
to go from 
Trinidad
 to  
New York
. And she just got there in
 time to see me graduate 
from high school. 

Q: Let™s Œ let™s back up, back to  you being in 
Holland
. So y Œ how long Œ how long 
were you in 
Holland
, total? 
A: Let™s see. ™39 to Œ about 14 months. 
Q: So how did you get from 
Holland
 to 
America
? Did you have to get a visa? 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
21
A: Yeah, oh yeah. That visa had been put in, and there was Œ when it came, you 
know, number came up, and somebody was 
Œ from the committee there, took us to 
the pier. We left from na Œ we didn™t leave from 
Holland
, we left from 
Belgium
. 
The ship left in 
Antwerp
. And then by that time, 
Germany
 and 
England
 were 
already at war. And we we
nt to Œ on th e way to 
Southampto n
 we spotted floating 
mines near 
Southampto n
, but none of them were set 
up. I saw them later on when I 
went from 
France 
to 
England
 Œ from 
England
 to 
France
 with the 
U.S.
 Army. And 
the other 
G.I.s
 tried to shoot and set off the floa
ting mines, but they never hit the 
right spot. You got a pl-place about this big,
 at a long distance, to Œ you know, this is 
to set it off 
[indecipherable]
 point. If you just hit the bo
dy, the body of the floating 
mine is heavy steel, and the mach
ine guns did not penetrate that. 
Q: So Œ 

A: But anyhow Œ 

Q: Where did your sa Œ where did your
 family settle when
 you emigrated to 
America
? 
A: First we were staying with the family 
of my  father™s brothe
r, who had been  there 
for a while. And Œ in 
Manhattan
, on 
91
st
 Street
. 
Q: And you Œ you attend
ed high school there? 

A: Yeah.

Q: Was it difficult ler Œ did you have to 
learn the language? Ha
d you spoken English 
before? 
A: Little bit. 
Q: So was Œ 
A: But I learned it after a while, and they Œ 
I Œ the teachers were actually excellent. 

That was a Œ not a particular prestigious hi
gh school. In fact, about half of them 

came from 
Harlem
, and one-third c-came from 
Hell™s K itchen
. So the teachers 
were very happy to have some kids who 
had more academic training. In fact, the 
interesting situation, the ki
ds who made the honor roll, two-th irds of them were 
foreign born. The ones who co
mpeted for valedictorian, nearly all of them spoke 
with an accent. I don™t Œ I was comp eting for it, but I had a big argument with my  

English teacher, who was a reviewer of the 
thing, and an argument when we read 
Julius Ca esar
, and I argued with her when  
Œ either, I think, either 
Cassius
 or 
[indecipherable]
 says, I forgot, because he was ambitious, I killed him. And I wrote 
my speech on th e necessity fo
r ambition. And the teacher recognized that argument I 
had with her, so I was blackballed on th
at. I had made the honor ro ll when  I 
graduated, but I did not get 
the valedictorian speech. Bu t 
then I did something else. 
Since I had such a mixed up prev ious educa
tion, I went to the different departments, 
and in so me case I took a regent ex amination, and I passed it and then I got cred it for 

the course, that got me through that fast. An
d some of them I just
 talked my way, I

think. I got some credits in art appreciati
on because I reviewed all the things I had 
seen in the Œ in the Italian and the Du
tch and the German mu seums. And I could 
distinguish different schools of pain ting an
d stuff like that, because my parents were 
very insistent when we went
 to these museums that I c
ould identify what it was, or 
who the Œ and I convinced them that I kne
w en ough ab out art appreciation, I could 
get credit for it. 
Q: Good for you. 
A: And I got all these language cred
its, and I did all right on math. So  Œ 
Q: You have a very diverse education. 
A: Yeah, then, the only thing is, I had to ta
ke fo Œ you had to take eight semesters of 
high school English, and I Œ I doubled up 
on them. They let me do that. And in fact, 
I don™t know, I even got in 
one of the honor classes. I 
don™t know how I ever did 
that, but Œ and I think maybe I ever had don
e mo re reading, not only in English, but 
in things in the in
ternational literature. 
Q: So you graduated from hi
gh school wh en you were 16
, and then did you join  Œ 
A: 16 and a day, I was very old. 

Q: Oh, right after your birthday. So  Œ 
A: I was very unhappy. Graduation Œ some 
gi Œ schools graduated on Tuesday, some 
Wednesday, some Thursday. My school gr
aduated on Thursd ay. They only had so

24
many caps and gown s to go 
around. If I would have been  on Tuesday school, I 
would have made it with 15. 
Wednesday was my  birthday. 
Q: What did you do after graduation? 
A: Well, I Œ I was a Œ that summer I was 
a junior con Œ a swimming counselor in a 
camp, and then shortly thereafter, my  parents moved to  
Ohio
, and I couldn™t get a 
decent job because of my ag
e. Even as a draftsman, they thought I might prick 
myself with a pencil. But those days the labor
 laws were ridiculous for a 16 year old, 
and said, why don™t you go back  to high sc
hool? I said, I graduated from there. So I 
got some helper jobs, not very mu ch and 
I started to do some vocational training, I 
went to a local high school and I took 
some evening courses 
in machine shop. I 
hadn™t done mu ch work  in machine shop, 
but I was interested in those things. And 

then, shortly before we got into war, we 
had defense prep aratory courses offered by 
different schools. And since I was in 
Co lumbus
, 
Ohio
, 
Ohio State 
provide that 
course, and I took so me of these courses, which were non-credit courses. But when  I 
bec Œ later on when  I was able 
to afford to go to college
, I talked to the prof who 
taught me the courses I had on 
[indecipherable]
 and I convinced him I didn™t have 
to take the course, he would 
give me academic credit for it.
 So that helped me. And I 
had Œ in fact, one of the guys
 was, i-in one of the fields
, the numb er one man in the 
country, who happen ed to be th e head of 
the department for engineering draw ing at 
Ohio State
. So, and then I went full time, fro
m the beginning of ™42 until November

of ™43. In the meantime, I got a letter cal
led greetings, your ne
ighbors want you to 
represent them in the armed forces. So 
the day Œ the day before Thanksgiving ™43 
was my  first day active duty. And on Th
anksgiving day was my  first day of 
KP
. And 
that was a big job that time. Then I sp
ent time in the army, I was being Œ with 
engineering back on 
Œ they put me into a signal co
rps, which, I mean, technical 
things, and then I went
 to something called 
ASTP
, are you familiar with that term? 
Q: N-No. 
A: It was Army Specialized Training Progra
m. What they had th
ere, they didn™t 
know how lo ng the war would last, and 
since no new kids we
re graduating from 
college, or very few, they had programs
 to give academic training and provide 
people for leadership and 
more responsibility later on.
 And they had it in two 
different Œ in several fields, one of them
 was linguistically, and the other one was 
engineering. So I went 
to the University of 
Ill inois
, where they tested me, and I 
qualified both fo r language and for engineer
ing. But I f Œ was looking lo ng term, so I 
signed up for the engineering ty pe, and they  sent me to 
Rutg ers
 University for about 
six months, to study engineering. And I got 
this Œ these were academic courses, so I 
got credit later on at 
Ohio State
 for the work I did there. 
And then, as they figured 
the war seems to have been comi
ng to the end, this was after 
D-Day
, and they  
looked like this Œ this progr
am was sending kids to colle
ge, was terminating, so I 
applied Œ I figured engineer
ing and languages, I applie
d for military  government

transfer. But somehow they 
didn™t Œ somehow they figu
red they needed me for 
military intelligence. So
 they sent me to 
Camp Ritchie
, if you ever heard of that. 
Q: Mm-mm. 
A: The so called 
Ritchie
 boys. This was Œ 
Camp Ritchie
 is in Œ near 
Hagerstown
, 
Mary land
, and this was the military intelligence
 training center. In fact, there™s a 
very good movie out, was made by a German comp any, called, ﬁ
The Ritchie Boys
,ﬂ 
and what happened, i-it was quite Œ it was 
very fair. They took people who had a 

certain high 
I.Q.
 Œ I forgot what the army called th
e thing right now Œ and they  were 
fluent in a language that was of interest; German or Italian or French. We were not 
that much concerned with eas
tern European languages.An
d they  had a similar thing 
on th e west coast, in br Œ in 
Monterey
, for people who were Œ were interested in 
Asiatic lan guages, and getting involved there.
 So I got to that 
camp, which theycou 
Œ on my  orders I™d even Œ couldn™t even say where I™m going to . And th at movie 

they made about it, I don™t know whether 
Holocaust Museum has Œ hat that, it™s Œ 
but it™s Œ but it™s a very interesting link.
 And these people di
d all kind of jobs, 
interrogation of prisoners dur
ing wa Œ during the fighting. And the mo st famous 
attendee of that school was 
Henry Kissinger
. But he graduated from there before I Œ 
I went there. And what happened? We Œ 
when we were finished, we knew more 
about the German military, the 
civil service, the reliability,
 things, when people were 
Œ were promoted on certain jobs, they had 
certain jobs, which ones were considered

highly Œ higher the liability 
for the Nazi regime. Or some of them were just Œ 
because the skill of somebody 
was, let™s say, the county
 engineer. Well, that™s 
because he si Œ knew how to 
put in sewer systems. But Œ 
and the Œ was Œ and I d Œ I 
didn™t get finished 
with that til after 
V-E
 
Da y
, so was lucky when I went overseas, I 
didn™t have to do any fighting. But I was i
nvolved in a lot of interesting episodes. I 
was in, for instance, typically
 in my favorite stories, th
ings that happened. There 
were Œ for instance, when there was a se
curity  raid in the occupation, because 
U.S. 
Army was invo Œ 
[indecipherable]
 was concerned that the Germans might pull 
Operation 
Werwolf
. That was the same  thing, the name Œ tag name they gave to 
what the French we
re doing with the 
Maquis
. Resistance. So they tried to undermine 
it. I know Œ so they, sometimes th ey had ra
ids and thing, looking for weapons, and 
looking for people that were on the 
[indecipherable]
 list. And wa Œ 
they had guys 
like me, assigned to battalion headquarter, an
d if they brought in something that was 
suspicious, I had to give it 
for a screening. I know one 
time they brought in a guy 
with a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a 
red cap. And I looked at him and I looked  
his 
I.D.
 and I looked at his brass button, and it said 
RB
, which means 
Reichsba hn
. 
And said, take that guy back to the railwaystation, he is the station master. But the 
normal 
G.I.
 wouldn™t know th-that guy from a
nother guy with a German uniform. 
Q: That™s funny. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
28
A: So this is a Œ this was some of the 
funny things, but I mean, I could Œ you could 
see they had support. I mean, people like 
my self, and colleagues of mine, who could 
thought things out. Not that 
they think they gotta arrest
 a guy because he wears a 
unifo rm. But he just Œ the kind of th
ing that I think is a funny story. 
Q: How long were you in 
Germany
 with the army? Were yo
u Œ you were stationed 
in 
Germany
, right? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How long were you there? 
A: Oh, let™s see. I got there, let™s s
ee, it was probably about from September or 
October ™45, til Œ and the stor
y gets complicated before it gets cleared up Œ and I 
stayed there until December ™47. And then  I 
was also involved in  war crimes trials. I 
was an investigator for one
 of the guys who got accuse
d, got indicted for the 
Nuremberg 
trials, but he was never tried, beca
use we could not get good ev idence 
on him. Plus when we blew his safe and fo
und all kind of thi Œ interesting things on 
there, including a letter from the Kaiser, 
because the guy was very important in 
World War I. The biggest gun in Worl
d War I was named after his wife. 
Q: Really? 
A: 
Big Bertha
. Did you ever hear 
about that? That gun? 
Q: No. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
29
A: It was the Œ then Œ the guy was 
Alfred Krupp
, from the 
Krupp
 factory, 
munitions maker and steel factory. 
And situation, they were in the 
Nuremberg 
trials 
and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice 
Jackson
, who was the prosecutor 
for 
Nuremberg
. And I attended one of these meetings
; they said, as you investigate, 
you gotta look for two things. Cri Œ prep ar
ing for and conducting aggressive warfare. 
That we found 
Krupp
, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing 
them, and things of that nature Œ othe
r war material. The other one was crimes 
against humanity; slave labor and that 
kind of stuff. And th
is ma Œ old man, 
Krupp
 
Œ and I have a lot of his personal history, 
to Œ was in Œ retired, I think because of 
health reasons, about the 
same t Œ  about the time 
Paris
 fell. So that™s before slave 
labor because a problem. And his son took 
over. So Œ and he and his son didn™t get 
along at all. And so he had 
Œ the Œ the old man didn™t have anything to  do with  the 
operation of the factory, or their personnel,
 or policies. He was there collecting his 
retirement pay, and that™s about all. In fact, 
it™s an interesting situation, that this guy 
is, when he was born, was not Œ his name was not 
Krupp
, because old man 
Krupp
, 
who was very big before
 World War I, who built up the factory a lot, 
Alfred Krupp
, 
and he ha Œ only had daughter
s, he had no sons. But he wanted to  perpetuate the 
name and the family. So the Kaiser had 
an ed ict by which the boyfriend, who was 
Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach
, was going to marry the 
Krupp
 woman, one of 
the 
Krupp 
daughters, could combine the name, 
Krupp von Bohlen und Halb ach
.

So he maintained his nob
ility name, but he main Œ 
he kept his Œ kept the 
Krupp
 
name in the family. So there was a special
 edict, I don™t know wh at year that was 
done, but it™s an interesting situation. 
Q: Yeah, it is interesting. 
A: And I used to have si Œ copy of his 
Œ I used to have his passport for a while. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Were there any other cases, lik e war crime 
trials that you work
ed on? The cr Œ the 
Krupp
 case and Œ 
A: Yeah, that was the only one for 
Nuremberg
. But then I worked
 for Œ well, again 
by th e pe Œ if I talk about things 
you know, I me Œ stop me. During the 
Yalta 
Conference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people 
who were involved on an inte
rnational basis, who were 
supposed to be tried by the 
international court, which were then 
Nuremberg
. Bu t things had happened, like 
concen tration camp or slave labor, in the 
countries whose zone 
of occupation was Œ 
was war crimes against individuals of that 
nationality, were supposed to be tried by 
courts of that ka Œ courts of that cor Œ of
 that nationality. For in
stance, again, there™s 
an interesting history whic
h is Œ don™t know whether Œ how well known that was, 
when  the Œ when  the Œ when  Œ during the fighting, 
U.S.
 troops got as far as the 
Elba
 
river. That meant they went past Œ through 
Thüring en
 where the ca Œ main town is

Weimar
, and where also 
Buch enwald
 was located there, just nearby th ere. And 
then, after the Œ they  rearranged the zones and Œ and that area of 
Weimar
 became 
Russian zone. So, since we had the eviden
ce, like lamp shades made from human bl Œ 
from human skin, and 
SS
 guards and oth Œ and all kind 
of stuff, including the wife of 
the former commandant, 
Ilse Koch
, and Œ more about her late
r. I said I have a long 
history of Œ 
[indecipherable]
 history. And so Œ so we moved befo re our troops 
withdrew  from that area, and the Russians 
moved in. We took all the stuff and put it 
into a facility in 
Da cha u
. We could intern the prisone
rs and had enough storage 
facilities to store the 
evidence. And there was a mission. Since Œ since 
Buchenwald
 
was supposed to be tried by 
Russia
, and since this is the Russian zone, we Œ we had 
a team of about two, three attorneys and 
about four linguists, 
who went thro ugh all 
that stuff that had been collected, and 
they Œ the lawyers 
put it into a legal 
documentation, to tu rn over to th e Russians,
 that they could us
e it as evidence. But 
the wi Œ Russians refused to accept it. They
 did not want to annoy the Germans. It™s 
in their zone, they wanted to say th
e communists are not doing things that 
Germany
 
look bad. So they refu
sed to do this. And so 
about Œ that was before 
Churchill 
spoke 
about the 
Iron Cu rtain
. That was 
Russia
 did not live up to its commitment under 
the 
Yalta 
Conference. So it™s Œ for many years 
later Œ about two years later they 
would Œ the 
Buchen wald
 people were tried in Americ
an war crimes trial, and I 
participated in that one. There 
were some interesting people 
[indecipherable]
 were

there, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in 
Dachau
 Œ in 
Da cha u
. The 
U.S.
 
trials. And one of the most in
 Œ at times I wasn™t sure 
I was going to  do that. Fo r a 
while I was either assistant to the prosecuto
r, assistant to the de
fense counselor, and 
was 
[indecipherable]
 court interpreter. Was sometim
e s assist ant to
 the judge, 
because they had terms, whic
h different people translated
 different ways. And they 
were Œ the judges were confused and th ey 
said, we heard this wa
s said to them, to 
them, what Œ how it happened? And th en I ha
d to figure out these were the same Œ 
translating it back into German, these we
re the same organization. So, and Œ but 
there was Œ there was some interesting people
 there. Probably the most famous Œ one 
of the most famous person who was triedthere, but he was acquitted, that was 
Otto 
Skorzeny
.
 
Did you ever heard about that name? 
Otto Skorzeny
 was the commander 
of the German Ranger. In fact, he became 
famous. After the Italian partisans had ca-
captured 
Mussolini
 and kept him on top of a mountai
n as a prisoner, his ranger unit, 
with glid ers and with mountain troo
ps, stormed that place and rescued 
Mussolini
. 
The partisan got
 Mussolini
 couple months later on and they
 killed him, but Œ but that 
was the guy. And this guy also became 
famous during the Ba
ttle of the Bulge, 
because he was commanding this ranger, Ge
rman ranger battalion, and he put them 
all in German Œ in American 
unifo rms, to go behind our 
lines Œ through our lines and 
disturb things, maybe destroy signal equi
pment and put on markers, direction signs, 
turn them around and to ca Œ 
and they were trying to, du
ring the Battle of the Bulge,

the aim of the 
Rumsted
(ph)
 
offensive was to capture 
Antwerp
. And he was an 
important part, but he was being tried Œ tried 
[indecipherable]
 for that. But there 
was an interesting thing. The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from
 Atlanta
, who 
had Œ he was usually a defense counselor, an
d he lost mo st of the cases, as defense 
counselor in war crimes trials. B u t he was 
a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because 
there was a guy who was Œ I don™t even know 
whether he was a lawyer or not, or he 
had some lawyer assistance. And he fo
und out that you can
not get anybody on 
espionage, or sabotag e. These are ruses of 
war. As long as you are not Œ as long as 
you are caught Œ not caught in the other c
ountry™s uniform. There were some of his 
men who were caught in American unifo rms, 
and they  were shot. But he was caught 
later on, I forgot whether in German uniform
, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that 
stopped it and he was acquitted. And then 
he became other things, he was Œ became 
the chief of security for 
Egypt
. He was some times Œ there was a Œ were some 
articles written, the mo
st dangerous man in 
Euro pe

Œ only one person didn™t like 
the Polish guards. There was th Œ my  dog. He always 
barked  at them. And he was a interesting dog. 

Q: What kind of dog was it? 
A: It was a German Shepherd, a relatively 
small one. But he was very good pedigree, 
because the couple Œ the dogs
 that bred him, used to 
belong to the German Field 
Marshal 
Mordell
, who, when he lost the 
[indecipherable]
 in the Œ after 
U.S.
 troops 
had moved east of the 
Rhine
 river, he committed suicide. 
Right before that, he gave 
his matched pair of dogs to a local farme
r. And I found out about those dogs. And he 
bred them, and I got one of his offsprings. Bu
t then, the kind of s
ituations that people 
do Œ in the thing, for inst
ance, I was stationed in 
Da cha u
 that time, and we had took 
a barrack where we get some veterinarian
s who were prisoners, 
and we dro Œ got a 
couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys
, and we had a veterinary clinic, because 
some of us had to go out of town fo r a coup
le of weeks, so we left the dogs there. 
But they  were too Œ even too dumb  to make
 sure they had all th
e medicine, so they 
died of distemper. Dist Œ the medi
cine was not easily available in 
Germany
, but we 
could have send it, call Œ contacted our pare
nts and have it sent from the States. So 
the dog did not Œ did not surviv e.
 But this is Œ but lot of the 
G.I.s
 had these thing. 
And by the way, if you keep pe Œ these pe
ople busy, I was working fo r a while, that 
was before that, in an internment camp, 
where they had people wh o Œ who were not 
accused of anything, but they we
re considered security risk
s, because they had really

high positions in the party, or in civil serv
ice, or in the military
. That™s primary Œ not 
in the general army, but in the 
S.S.
 or something like that. An
d they were housed in 
German army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had 
all the heat, the hot water, they had decent
 food, which was short at that time, b u t 
they were bored. So we a
rranged with them, a craft shop
. Some of them were very 
handy. And I have Œ still have at home, f
our paintings which Œ watercolors, about 
this size, which the guy did from memo ry, 
and th ey are very nice paintings, and I 
really treasure them. And they were Œ 
didn™t have much stuff, they were 
[indecipherable]
 canvas, they were the back 
of the ration boxes. So they 
improvised, and I got them home, I got th
em framed. And they didn™t want to get 
paid in money. They  said, if you do Œ if
 it™s Œ you know, we Œ well, it was good 
relationship between these craftsmen and the 
G.I.s
. They said no, I would appreciate 
it rather, if you would send a package with 
some chocolates or some  other candy to 
my wife or to my kids. 
And we got that at the 
PX
. So  it™s, again, the people wh o had 
Œ we were sorting out
 who was a real security risk
, who was Œ on the war crimes 
wanted list that was put down
 Œ put out by all 
the countries, sorting things out, and 
these were primarily the guys, the 
Ritchie
 boys. And they were very  young guys. I 
think our detachment commander, he was old, 
he was 21 years old. He was a second 
lieutenant. But th
is Œ oh, sorry. 
Q: No, you™re fine. Oops, here. Okay. 
It™s still recording, we™re good.

A: Okay , nothing.

A: No disconnects? 

Q: Nope, nope, we™re 
Œ we™re Œ we™re good. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Okay . 
A: All right, I™m sti Œ we™re 
still wired. So Œ interesti
ng thing is while I was in Œ 
investigating in that 
[indecipherable]
 team, I met a young lady who was the Œ a 
telephone operator for the 
British organization, it was Br
itish zone of occupation. 
And she had been  a telephone operator for 
the German post office, the post office 

was running the telephone system in 
Germany 
at that time. And then she was 
delegated to  be the private 
telephone operator for the state adjutant general. I mean, 
she was very good in it, to get that partic
ular thing. And then 
when the British took 
over, she went Œ became telephone operat
or for one of the British headquarters. 
There was a 
[indecipherable]
 commi ssion, they Œ since this
 is the area where the Œ 
which produced the most coal
, and they rationed the co al 
allocations through all the 
occupation areas. And we got quite involved,
 to the extent that she was my  wife, 
through the war part.

A: 
Hanni

Q: What was maiden Œ 
her maiden last name?

Sessilman

involved in the 
BDM 
and co mp eting in th e contests th
ey have for different things. 
And no, we had a very  good marriage of 62
 years, and she died day after Christmas 
last year. 

Q: Sorry to hear that. 

A: So when we got married in 
Dachau
, by the mayor
 
of 
Dach au
. In fact, we were, I 
think the second couple involving a 
G.I.
 and a war bride, that was married by that 
guy. Bu t he gave an endlessly long speech
, and we were then 
supposed to have a 
reception at the officers™ club. And we were
 getting late and late, so when we finally 
got through, we told the dr
iver to step on it, and we 
got a speeding ticket from the 
MPs
. But then we had a reception at the 
Œ or a din Œ a nice dinner at the 
[indecipherable]
 club. And Œ and a band an d everything else. 
Q: What year was this? 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
38
A: F-For Œ ™47. In fact, this is one 
reason when the Œ I stayed longer in 
Euro pe
 th an  
I had to, because when I was s
upposed to come back for di
scharge, come back to the 
States, I could not bring my  Œ I co
uld not get married, I was Œ as a 
G.I.
 you had to 
get permission by the military to marry, a
nd I could not get th
at permission, and 
without that she couldn™t co
me to the States. So, since there was a shortage of 
people, they offered all kind of
 incentives for people to stay
 there if they had certain 
skills. And I stayed there as a civilian, wh
ere I made quite a bit more money, but I 
was a Œ they had a uniform for the civilians
. So Œ and it was important that you wore 
some service ribbons, that meant you were 
not a carpetbagger. So me guys, they just 
went there and never in  the service, but th
e fact that you were in the service, you 
were accepted by them. And we could go to the 
R
 and 
R 
centers in the Œ near the 
Alps
 and used to have some good times over the weekends. And was on a lake, and 
early morning there had to be a festival
. And then you went on a sailboat. They 
rigged it for you, you didn™t
 have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until 
lunchtime. And then there wa
s a Œ then there™d be a part
y in the afternoon. So Œ and 
with an oompah
-pah bands and all this kind 
of stuff. No, this is the Œ
 G.I.s
 at that 
particular time, if they could get to thos
e places, the army took good care of them. 
Except one thing is, there was one of the 
experiences my wife had. We went to a 
place where we knew there was an 
R 
and
 R
 center, we went th
ere, but we did not 
know that was for blacks. But we asked th
em whether we could have lunch there. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert  
 
October 16, 2010 
 

 
 
39
Said yes. But then we sat on a table, and 
there was some blacks 
sitting on the table, 
they said, hey you, you can™t sit th er
e with them. That™s Œ that was the 
U.S.
 military 
in ™46 - ™47, before 
Truman 
integrated the military in Œ 
forgot again the year that 
was. Yeah, I think it was one of the first things
 he did. I think he did that after Œ after 
V-J 
Day. Well, okay, then we got married th
ere, and we could go over Œ we went 
back to the States. 
Q: Where did you settle? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: Where did you live? 

A: I went back to 
Co lumbus
, 
Ohio
, wh ere my parents were living. And I went back 
to 
Ohio
 
State
 and got my degree. In fact, three weeks ago, I was elect Œ I was titled 
distinguished alumnus from 
Ohio State
, for engineering department. 
Q: Oh, congratulations. 

A: Thank you. I got Œ had quite a bit of 
involvement with the Œ I was me mb er of a 
industry review board to advise profs what
 kind of things are strong, that industry 
needs and they sho Œ should 
emph Œ things they should 
emphasize. For instance, one 
of my  biggest comp laint, I think th at™s not only with engineers, but with other 
people, too Œ you went 
to college, did you? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Which one did you go to ?

Q: Well, I bounced around
, but I graduated from 
North Dakota  State Univ ersity
. 
A: I see, okay. 
North Dakota
. I™ve not spent any Œ I spent quite a bit of time in 
Wyomin g
, and I used to go to 
South Dako ta
 to go skiing at the Œ was it 
Black 
Hills
, or Œ yeah, I used 
to go skiing in the 
Black Hills
. When ever I had Œ I was in Œ 
in 
Gillette
,
 Wyomin g
. I was working in a coal mine th
ere. And let™s see Œ no, this is 
Œ no, this was quite interesting, to get the 
Œ to work  with th e profs and do things, and 
this is Œ yeah, I mean, the 
things I said, which is some
thing wa Œ most universities 
make a big mistake. When you went to 
college, whatever you 
studied, wh en you 
wrote a term paper, or had to give a 
report, who was your target audience? 
Q: My professor. 
A: Yeah. Somebody who 
knew much more about 
it than you did. In real life, most of 
the people deal with people 
that know less about it. For in stance, when I learned 
about computer, they 
told me to toggle over, and I 
looked for a toggle switch. I 
mean, the kind of terminology. Doctors 
are great for using terms which nobody 
understands unless you™re a docto r yoursel
f. Engineers do th at too, accountan ts at 
times, and Œ 
Q: Everybody does. 
A: Yeah. Th-That™s where you were traine
d. And I was trying to  get the school to 
mandate that the ki Œ that the students ta
ke a course in public
 speaking. True non-
specialists in Œ let™s see, what is 
that organization that gives speeches?

Q: Toastmake Œ 
A: What? 

Q: Toastmakers? Toastmakers? 
A: Yeah, Toastmaster. 
Q: Oh, Toastmaster. 

A: Yeah. The kind of a thi
ng th at they do there by wh ich you are asked to give, for 
instance, this is something I 
either learned in the military, 
then when I get back, after 
I started working there, I also went back 
in the reserve. And I 
progressed quite a bit 
there, and I commanded a unit, and I had so me fun with  something. It was 

[indecipherable]
 we had inspection from a guy from 
Washington
 coming, I don™t 
know, from headquarters. And I kn-knew abou
t it, when that was, and I scheduled 
commanders time. And one of my  favorite th
ings to schedule there is Œ it was during 
the 
Eisenhower
 administration, 
[indeciphera ble]
 for peace. And I was involved in 
building the first commercial nuclear plant 
in this country. An
d so I talked about 
how they operate and I had the drawings 
all over the wall, and Œ til I found out the 
inspector hadn™t heard about that, but I coul
d put it in a way that this guy who was 
maybe an accountant or something like that, 
or an auditor could fo Œ could fo llow it. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so in  fact, I had some fun. I had my  senior non-com was a high school 

teacher, and I made a deal with him: whenever
 I gave a lecture Œ and I had to do that 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert

42
once a week , we met once a week and Œ for 
two hours Œ one hour
 I had to do the 
work; he critiqued it. He took notes, what 
I did well, what I didn™t do well: talking 
too fast, not getting things or
ganized, talking to the bl
ackboard , all that kind of 
mistake. Using terms that were not defined.
 So after the meetings, we went to the 
nearby legion post and we both had beer, an
d he gave me a critique. And I am very 
thankful for what he has done fo r me. And 
I have addressed, I think last year at 
Ohio 
State
, I addressed a group of about 400 people. 
Q: Wow, that™s incredible. 

A: Yeah, so it™s Œ I Œ I feel comfortable with doing th at. 

Q: Yeah, you™ve had lots of practice. 
A: What? 
Q: You™re have lots of practice. 

A: Yeah, right, yeah . Doing th at and then  
back in the engineering part, I had to 
testify, or talk to governmental agencies. Like one time in 
Cana da
 and one time in 
Malaysia
. 
Kuala Lumpur
. 
Q: 
Malaysia
, wow. 
A: We were doing something that was non-st
andard, and I had to defend it. So there 
were a lot of people, some of them were
 technically trained, some were not. Why 
we™re doing it, what we™re doing, what the ri
sk was, and what the training was for to 
be done properly, and what the results 
are from the testing that had been done

before. But I felt quite comfortable even
 talking to a foreign country like in 
Kuala

. 
Q: I™m going to stop the Œ the track, and 
we™re going to start a new one, cause it™s

, conducted by
 Annie Erling
, on th e 16
th
 of October, 
2010, at the 
Kindertransport Asso ciation Conference 
at 
Arlington
,
 Virginia
. So, 
do you have any children with 
Hann i
? 
A: No, no, we decided we didn™t want an
y. But I have nephews and nieces with 
whom I™m quite close, and Œ 
Q: Did you s Œ did you stay in 
Colu mbus
, 
Oh io
? 
A: No, when I graduated, I went to 
Milwaukee
, 
Wisconsin
, and then  I went to 
Marietta
, 
Ohio
. In fact, there I 
worked for a compan
y, and they  had a 
Marietta
 
College, and they had some night courses in
 busin ess related things, but to be an 
accredited thing where you could get a degr
ee, they had to take some science 
courses. But the science faculty at 
Marietta 
College
 
were so lazy, and they didn™t 
have a graduate school, so they didn™t ha
ve the graduate stude
nts who could Œ would 
teach those. So the Œ the dean of the gra
du Œ of the night school got people out of 
industry. I was teaching physics, and engin
eering drawing, and they had some other 
people were teaching accounti
ng and chemistry and stuff lik
e that. So the wa Œ it was 
quite, quite interesting. In fact, it was lik
e teaching liberal arts because maybe I 
talked about a different piece of equipment 
in a power plant, and so me guy says, oh, 

I know all about it. This is depreciated 
over five years, because the guy was in 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert

accounting. But he had no idea wh
at in the world it was doing, why it was there. So I 
tried to clear that up. 
No, it™s all right. So Œ 
Q: Is there anything else that you™d like to Œ 
A: Well, yeah, that™s Œ I™ve stayed Œ stayed
 in the military , and I got Œ had a Œ had Œ 
also had a Œ what was known as a mobiliz
ation designation. Th
at meant Œ familiar 
with that term? 
Q: Mm-mm, no. 
A: That me ans you are training for a job th
at™s held by someb
ody else, in case a 
balloon goes up, one of you guys Œ maybe 
we™ll split the headquarter, and we need 
two people with that traini
ng, and I used Œ I did that, 
and I was in the intelligence 
branch . And one of the things that I wa
s really trying to push, and we were 
successful Œ that was during th e Cold  War era,
 that we had linguistic training. People 
training in linguistic and it was all packed
 military items. We had several reserve 
units. We were lucky; the Cold War never 
got hot. We di Œ they  didn™t have to be 
called up. Maybe some people got called up during th e 
Berlin
 crisis, but well, there 
was not Œ then we were pr
epared, as compared Œ and 
I may be talking politics now, 
during th e Gulf Wars, we had not Œ the gov
ernment had not prepared  linguists who 
could speak Arabic. I™m sure there are pl
enty guys around there who are maybe 
people who immigrated from 
Jordan
, or immigrated from 
Israel
 or
 Palestine
, or 
some of these Œ 
Egypt
, or some of the other countries, who could handle these

46
languages. And so it Œ it was Œ no, then, th
at™s interesting. When I Œ I was working 
for 
Exxon 
fo r Œ as an engineering specialist for 
about 30 years, and I worked  in 22 
countries, often teaching courses there. And 
you learn some of the tricks of the trade 
of how teaching in a foreign country. 
For instance, I was giving a course in 
Japan
, 
and I found a commercial book, or an advert
 Œ actually a catalog by a company that 
had published the same  thing 
in  English and in Japanese. 
I had the English one, so I 
got the Japanese one, and got 
one of those for each of my  students from the supplier, 
and if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had 
a slide, but then for the Japanese to read 
things about it, I would have in there saying 
E
 page 42, 
J
 page 52, so they could 
look up the referen
ce material. Plus, the idea of si
mp le sentences. Many p Œ and 
speaking very slowly. If I would have 
a foreign sp eaking audience Œ foreign 
language sp eaking audience, I would sp
eak about this pace.
 And no k Œ no 
complicated sentences, whic
h th e French can do th e 
conditionnel
. I don™t know 
whether we use that in English, the conditional case. 
Q: I™m bad at grammar. 
A: I mean, when you insert, 
the green house, which is lo
cated on the next street. You 

know, by inserting that thing. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Is for sale. I mean, 
if that™s Œ that is loca Œ the ne
xt street. Make that a separate 
sentence. This is putting two thoughts togethe
r. So I had a lot of fun with that, and I

stayed in some countries where Œ which generally are not known as being Jewish 
friendly, like 
Gaddafi™s Libya
. I worked there for a while. 
I was about four times in 
Saudi Arabia
, and I worked there, and recently
, since I retired, I™m working for Œ 
part time fo r a company, and I was in 
United Emirates
. 

Q: Oh. You™ve traveled a lot. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: That™s incredible. 
A: Yeah, I said I worked in 22 
countries, and I think I visited 52. 
Q: Wow.  
A: But I didn™t Œ I always liked to go in th e 
Far East
. I used to Œ I used to enjoy
 
Thailand
, 
Singapore
, 
Malaysia
, 
Japa n
. And I Œ I really enjoyed 
Pakistan
. And 
Pakistan
 was one of the most surprises. Fo
r instance, I was working there on a 
fertilizer plant, we were rebuilding things
, and they Œ I had so
me young engineers. 
And about half the young engineers were i
ndigenous females, and they were treated 
just as well, were given assignments equiva
lent to wh at the Œ the male engineers of 
the same ex perience level were getting. So
 wh en you, in so
me, I guess, in the 
primitive farm areas, th is may be different, 
but in the industrial area, there is Œ you 
find out the f Œ the female is treated bette
r. And we were sitting 
all together, having 
lunch and stuff like that. 

Q: Oh. 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert

A: The only thing is, the guest house I wa
s staying was next to a mo sque, and they 
woke me up every morning wh en they called 
for prayer. So, I had a lot of fun with 
those things. I mean, this is the experience
s. I said, I lived history, the same way. 
First time I was in 
Israel
 Œ in fact, to get there I was Œ had been in  
Pakistan
, and I 
cou Œ they  couldn™t f Œ you couldn™t fly from 
Pakistan
 to
 Israel
, so I flew from 
Pakistan 
to  
Tehera n
, 
Iran
, from Œ at that time there 
was Œ the shah was still in 
command. I Œ they could fly from 
Teheran
 to 
Jerusalem
. And I decided to  do so me 
sightseeing. But I figured, these old things, 
they have been  around that long, fine. 
But it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the 
Gola n Heig hts
, and we we went up th e 
Gola n Heig hts
 the same way his unit went 
up. I™m glad they cleared up all the mines. 
But it was very interesting. That™s another 
interesting experience dealing with that part
 of the wo rld. We Œ th is guy had Œ he 
was Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at
 one place, and we went there and I got 
some tea an d some dates. Not dates with
 women, dates the food. And th en there 
were Œ near there there was a warehouse, 
and there were some trucks parked. And 
these trucks had Israeli license plate, and 
he said Œ they had 
wing-nuts on th em. He 
said, you loosen one of those wing-nuts. 
And they had Jordan
ese license plates. 
What happened? They were taking the famous 
Jaffa 
oranges Œ although it was not in 
Jaffa
, it was farther west, but the same type, 
and transporting them
 to the Jordanese 
Œ to the border between 
Israel
 and 
Jordan
, then change the licen
se plate, and then 

 
Interview with Harry Ebert

moved to  Œ all the way to 
Saudi
, because 
Saudi
 had the money an d they Œ th ey 
wanted the Œ the better food. So this is 
a kind of cooperation th
at the Israeli were 
aware what was going on and th ese Arabic 
farmers who were growing th e oranges 
up there in 
[indecipherable]
 were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers 
got paid. So  it was Œ no, I™ve been  several times visiting 
Israel
, but that was an 
interesting experience. Also, 
from the military poin
t of view, there is a place ju st east 
of Œ east of 
Tel Aviv
 on a mountain called 
Kenkillya
(ph). From there you could fire 
some of the bigger guns into 
Tel Aviv
. And I think th e Israelis made a big mistake of 
ma Œ considering part of the 
West Bank
, they should have annexed that, as a 
security, to control the high grou
nd. After they found out at the 
Golan Heig hts
 how 
important the high ground is. So I™m 
sure they had enou
gh people who were 
studying this thing. And then with th
e military, I st Œ st
ayed with a co Œ

A: And a living room. So that was Œ that 
was a convenient way. I figured I didn™t 
want to drive all the way from 
New Jersey
 to

guess that™s pretty well known, that 
East
 
Baltim ore 
Street. And I Œ
 
if I wanted to get 
all my  tu Œ all my  guys together, the best place to find them was at 
East
 
Baltimore
 
Street.
