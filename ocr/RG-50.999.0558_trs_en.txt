What you are about to hear 
fr om  Gideon is  one individual's  ac c ount of the Holoc aus t. We have prepared a br ief s lide pres entation 

to 
help with his  intr oduction
. 
              
  
 
We begin with this c hildhood photograph of Gideon Fr ieder, who was  born September
 
30, 
1937.
 
 
Gideon was  born in Zvolen, Slovakia. On this m ap of Europe, the ar r ow points  to Slovakia.
 
 
Her e we s ee Gideon's  father
, Abraham Fr ieder. Gideon's  father, a rabbi, was  part of the 
undergr ound wor king gr oup of the Slovak J ewry and was  res pons ible for com munic ations  with the 

Slovak author ities .
 
 
The photo on the left is  of Gideon and his  s is ter, Gita. The photo on the r ight 
is  of Gideon's  
par ents, Ruzena and Abram , before the war.
 
 
In 1944, dur ing the Slovak  upr is ing against the Nazis , Gideon, his mother and his  s is ter fled 
fr om  Nove Mes to, where they had been living s inc e the beginning of the war. In October  they made 

their 
way nor theas t to Bans ka Bys tr ic a, whic h s erved as  the c enter of the upris ing. Bec aus e of his  
c onnec tion to the working group, Gideon's father fled s eparately.

On this  map of Slovakia, the ar row points  to the loc ation of Banska Bystrica
. A s the Nazis  
were near ing Banska Bys tr ic a, the family fled to the m ountains  wher e they were c aught in a m assac r e 
at Star e Hory. Gideon's m other  and s is ter  were k illed.And Gideon was  wounded.
 
Gideon was  taken from the m ass ac re s ite by Henry Herzog, who eventually took  him to the village of 

Bully wher e he was  plac ed in the home of Paulina and J ozef Str yc hars zyk .
 
 
This  is a c ontempor ary photogr aph of the home where Gideon was  hidden until 1945. He was  
later found by his  father  who s urvived the war .
 
         
 
Gideon lives  in theWas hington, D.C. ar ea with his  wife
, 
Dalia, having em igrated fr om Israel to 
Buffalo, New York , in 1975 and then moving her e in 1992. They have three c hildr en, a s on, Ophir, and 
two daughters, Tally and Gony, and four grandc hildr en, including twins  who are 7 years  old. Their 
granddaughter, Gita, is  named for Gideon's  s is ter, whom  we s hall hear about in a s hort while. 
 

 
I'm pleas ed to s ay that Gony, his daughter, is  here in a s urpris e vis it. Gideon thought s he was  
in Florida today. Instead s he's  here in the audience with us .
 
 
Gideon is  a phys ic is t and c om puter s c ientist. He ear ned his  
d
oc torate in quantum phys ic s  in 
Is r ael
. 
Upon his r etir em ent in 2010 as the A. J ames
 
Clark Profess or at the Sc hool of Engineer ing and 
Applied Sc ienc e at George Was hington Univer s ity, he was  nam ed the A. J ames Clark Pr ofes s or  
Em er itus of Engineer ing and Applied Sc ienc e, the fir st tim e in the his tory of the GeorgeWas hington 
University that the Board of Tr ustees kept an endowed c hair  title for an Em eritus Pr ofes s
or
. 
He als o 
pr evious ly s er ved as  the s c hool's  dean.
 
          
 
Gideon has als o taught and held dean and c hairman pos itions  at Syr ac us e Univers ity, the 
University of Mic higan, and the State Univers ity of New York at Buffalo
. 
He s er ved in the Is r aeli Minis tr
y 
of Defens e in Researc h and Development and als o s er ved in the Israeli Air  For c e
. 
In addition to 
teac hing, he has been a c ons ultant with government agenc ies and pr ivate c ompanies, s er ved as  an 
expert witnes s  in patent and c opyr ight litigation and he holds
 
s ever al patents .
 
          
 
Gideon's s on Ophir holds  the title of Inaugural Rober t L. Mc Dewitt and Catherine H. Mc Dewitt 
Pr ofes s ors hip, whic h is the highest endowed c hair pos ition in Georgetown Univer s ity. Ophir  form erly 
s er ved as  the Chair of the Com puter Sc ienc es  Department at Georgetown Univer s ity. He is  als o a 
pr ofes s or in the Sc hool of Medic ine at Georgetown. Gideon and his  s on, who als o volunteers his  tim e 

and exper tis e to this  m useum , are c ollaborating on s ever al c omputer pr ojec ts  c onc er ning degr ade
d 
images.
 
          
 
One of thes e pr ojec ts  is  a c om puter
-
bas ed initiative to aid in the r ec ognition of faded 
doc um ents  that was  s tarted six years  ago in c ooperation with a Germ an team from the Univers ity of 
Br em en. Their r ec ent work in the Germ an labor atory had led to a break through in the pr oc es s ing of 

faded doc uments  whic h is  now the s ubject of thr ee U.S. patents and one international patent. They 
hope to us e this  tec hnology to impr ove the us ability of faded doc um ents in the m us eum .
 
          
 
With that, 
I would like you to join m e in welc oming our Firs t Pers on, Gideon Fr ieder. 
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Gideon, for joining us and for your willingnes s  to be our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
today. 
We have an hour  or
 
s o. I know you have s o m uc h to s hare with
 
us  s o we will s tar t r ight away.
 
 
Although Germ any over ran Poland in Septem ber
 
1939 and s oon dom inated Eur ope, your 
hom e c ountry of Slovakia was  allied with the Germ ans  and, therefor e, not oc c upied by them until m uc h 

later. Before we talk about the start of the war , the events  that led to the oc c upation by the Germ ans , 
fir s t tell us a little bit about your fam ily and your comm unity in the year s before the war  even began.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Well, I was  a c hild, s o what I rem em ber is  what a c hild will r em em ber. Although 
Slovakia was  not oc c upied by the Ger mans until 1944, it did ins titute anti
-
J ewis h legislation, whic h by 
s om e meas ur e is even har s her than
 
the original Germ an Nur em berg Laws. So ther e was  
persec ution
. 
There was  the deportation. There was  mayhem
 
and mur der in the Slovak
-
held territory even befor e the 
Germ ans c ame.
 
 
For  m e, as  a c hild, it was  a regular  c hildhood with the exc eption that every J ew knew that 
ther e wer e c ertain r oads, c ertain plac es  in the c ity that I just don't go bec aus e the c hildr e
n will throw 

3 
 
r ocks at m e or beat m e. But that was  a regular occ ur renc e for  the J ewis h population in Slovakia 
generally s peaking.
 
So I didn't have a feeling of war , r eally, until 1944. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let's  go bac k  a little ways , even befor e the war began, in 1939. Your family m oved to 

Nove Mesto at one point. Was ther e a large J ewish c omm unity in either  Nove Mes to or where they had 
m oved fr om?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes , ther e was  a large c ommunity in both plac es. 
 
 
I have to be c areful when I s ay large. Becaus e Slovakia is  a s m all c ountry. And the large c ities  
were s mall. And I s ay it bec aus e I had an opportunity to visit China to a medium
-
s ized c ity and they 
s aid, oh, there are only s ix m illion her e. So when I s ay large c ommunity, large relative to the s ize
 
of 
thos e c ities .
 
 
Nove Mesto in partic ular , was  a ver y ac tive c ommunity. They wanted my father to c ome ther e 
to create a new type of ac tivities  in whic h he did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your father  was , by all ac c ounts , a r em arkable man.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  
Technology. What c an we say?
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your father  was  a remarkable man. By all ac c ounts  he was  s ort of the c enter of the 
J ewis h c omm unity in your  c omm unity. Tell us  about him.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I would be bias ed about my father for  a reas on that you will appr ec iate in a 
m om ent.
 
 
He was  r eally an extraordinar y m an. For example, he finis hed at the s am e time a full c ours e of 
s tud
ies  in a sec ular univer s ity while he was  attending what we c all a Yes hiva, a r eligious sc hool to 
bec om e a r abbi. And he did it s im ultaneous ly earning both degrees, rabbi and undergraduate degree
, 
and later doc tor ate in philos ophy and Germ an literatur e, whic h was  ver y unus ual for a rabbi to do, 

obvious ly.
 
 
He was  also unus ual in his  ability to s peak many languages. He was ver y, ver y ac c epted and I 
think  appr ec iated by the Catholic  c lergy. Slovakia is  85% Catholic , 15% protes tant, and 0% everything 
els e.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  So the Catholic  clergy had a lar ge, large
 
--
 
or has  still a large influenc e. H
e was  
very ac c epted by them . He was  able to s peak  and lec ture and c omm unicate in the m ajor languages  

whic h were Slovak, obvious ly, German and Hungarian. Slovakia was  pr evious ly, until the end of the 
Firs t World War, part of the 
A us tr ia
-
Hungarian Em pire. So
 
anybody who was  anybody s poke 
Hungar ian, Germ an, and 
the language of his  own c ountry.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A lot of what your  father was  involved in and helping to build a Zionis t c omm unity was  

agr ic ultur ally r elated, was n't it? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  It was  trade r elated, not only agric ultur e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sor ry. We ar e having tec hnologic al or I'm having tec hnologic al diffic ulties . Thank you. 
There we go.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I'm suppos ed to be the tec hnologis t. It works.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But I'm not.
 
>> [La
ughter] 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  He was  an unus ual r abbi, als o
, 
in the s ens e that he was  Zionis t. Zionis t was  not 
very ac c epted by the m os t extreme r eligious part of the Jewr y in Eur ope bec aus e they believed going 

bac k  to the Holy 
L
and has  to be done by the m ess iah, not by any ways . So Zion was  questionable, 
m or e c ons ider ed s ec ular. 
 
 
But he was  ver y ac c epted by the Zionist. He was Zionis t hims elf. Indeed, befor e the war  he 
had the pos s ibility to emigrate to what was  then called Pales tine but he dec ided to s tay with his  
c om m unity. So that m ade him  als o a per s on whic h c ould bring together both the ver y religious and the 
s ec ular  par ts of the population. Indeed, dur ing the beginning of the war  until 1944, when the Germ ans  
invaded, he was
 
par t of what we c alled the wor king group. It is  m or e known in his tory by its  Ger man 
nam es , [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language].
 

4 
 
 
This  was  a gr oup whic h is  unique in his tory bec aus e it had r epr es entatives  fr om both 
extremely r eligious  par t of the Jewis h community on one hand up to the very extr em ely left part c alled 
[Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language] of the Jewis h c omm unity. He was  able to put together that gr oup. It 
was  not headed by him. Again, the group is  very s pec ial bec aus e it was  headed by a wom an, whic h at
 
that tim e was  ver y unusual
, a
 
woman of valor s  whic h regr etfully per is hed in Aus c hwitz.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you des c r ibed to m e your
 
father's r ole was  more lik e a s ecretar y of s
tate.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yeah, bec aus e of his  k nowledge of languages , becaus e of the fac t that he was  s o 

c onnec ted to the es tablishment. He was  ac c epted by them. He c ould do that.
 
 
I'll give you one exam ple how he was  ac c epted. There was  a m inis ter in the gover nm ent who 
r eally had a dr eam to get a doctor ate. So my father wrote him  a doc tor al degree, ac tually wrote him a 

doc tor al whic h was  publis hed under his  name.
 

> > Bill Bens on: Wrote his  dis s ertation
 
for him?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  He wrote the whole dis s ertation, yes . He s aid, 
ﬁW
hy not
?ﬂ 
Anybody want a 
doc tor ate? 
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as a r es ult he was
 
--
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  As  a r es ult, he c ould be in his offic e, he c ould look  at doc uments , dis c us s  things , 

get influenc e. There's a cer tain ps yc hologic al dependenc e between students  and profes s ors , es pec ially 

on the high gr aduate level. So he was  able, ther efor e, to have c onnections  to the part of the 
es tablis hment whic h regular  r eligious r abbis or regular people c ouldn't have.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e not quite 7 when the Germ ans oc c upied Slovakia in 1944. The war
 
began in 
September
 
1939. Dur ing thos e year s  fr om the beginning of the war in 1939 to the German oc c upation, 
1944, what was  that ver y long per iod of life like for you and your  family
? 
As  you mentioned, they had 
ins tituted exc eptionally har s h anti
-
J ewis h la
ws  already. What was  that period of life like
? 
This  was  when 
your  father was  active in the working group.
 
>>
 
Gideon Fr ieder:  My fam ily was  r elatively protec ted. And when I s ay my fam ily, I m ean the 
imm ediate fam ily. The J ews  wer e not. They were depor ted in 1942. 
 
 
I m entioned before, talking to s om ebody, that the Slovaks  had the dis tinc tion of paying to the 
Naz
i gover nm ent 500 mark, whic h was  a king's rans om  at the tim e, for every J ew that the Germ ans  
took to kill. So they wer e not regular  tim es.
 
 
But for me
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The money
 
--
 
I think you told me the money that was  paid was  taken fr om J ews  to pay 
f
or their deportation.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes . This  is  the elegant par t of it. The J ews  paid for  their  own extinc tion. The 

Slovaks  had a pr oc es s  called Aryanization in whic h they took all the J ewis h pr oper ties  and cr eated the 
funds from  whic h they paid the
 
Germ ans.
 
 
The reas on I know about it is I work  as  a volunteer  in the m us eum  in the arc hives  and I was  
tasked in proving that this  is  really not a rumor . And I found a doc ument. And I us e it now in m y 

lec tures. It's  written in very, very offic ial type of language but it has  all the information.
 
 
So the tim es wer e har sh but for me as a c hild, I was  a c hild.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was , well, bec aus e you wer e a c hild.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  My family was  pr otected. My father  was  pr otec ted. He was  not depor ted.
 
He had 
the r ight to s tay.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e you able to begin your  education at that time?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes . I s tar ted prim ary s c hool, as a m atter of fact. In a J ewis h s c hool, fir st grade. 

The teac her , one of the teac her s , was  m y unc le who was  also a gr aduate of a Yes hiva. But he was  not 
a rabbi. He was  just teaching. And I finis hed firs t grade.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Then October happened.
 

5 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that period until 1944, of c ours e war  is going on els ewher e in Eur ope and 
Slovakia is allied with the Ger m ans . Did your fam ily exper ienc e the depravations  of war
? 
Was it diffic ult 
to
 
--
 
was  food s car ce or anything like that?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I as sum e so.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You don't know
? 
Right.
 
> > Gideon Fried
er:  Not fr om m y own experienc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  No. But from  hear ing it later ?
 
> > Gideon 
Fr ieder:  Hearing later is hear
s ay, r ight?
 
> > B ill Bens on:  Right. Right.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I r ead a lot about the Holoc aust. I educ ated mys elf.When I s peak  about
 
the 
Holoc aus t, I try to eliminate that knowledge and speak  of what I know alone. They want me to s peak  

about other things I c an. But in the inter views , like lec tures , I tend to c oncentrate on the things which I 
r em em ber fr om m y own exper ienc e.
 
> > Bill B en
s on:  From your own exper ienc e, do you rec all any inc idenc e of anti
-
S em itism ?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Oh, yes . Oh, yes. There were s tr eets I c ouldn't go through.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you knew that.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  And I knew that. The kids will throw s tone
s. How did they know that I am  a J ew
, i
t 
eludes  me. I had blond hair , str aight nos e, s poke the sam e language they s peak . Som ehow they k new
. 
Ma
ybe
 
I c ame fr om the wr ong dir ection. But it was  c lear, the plac es I c ouldn't go. Ther e were things I 
c ouldn't do, go to am us em ent park s , natur e.
 
 
I did go with m y father to s om e of the work c amps in Slovakia. Ther e were m any of them
, 
wh
er e the Jews  were detained. So I knew they were detained. I k new that bec aus e ther e wer e bar bed 
wires . But it didn't hit m e what it means. They were just in a c am p. Big deal, c am p. Thes e wer e not 

exter mination c am ps. Thes e were war c amps. They produc ed pr oduc ts for the war effort.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Although the Nazis  didn't begin conduc ting their  depor tations until 1942, befor e 
--  
do 
you
 
know if your  father  play
ed
 
any r ole in tr ying to s top deportations
? 
Was he able to do that as the 
s ecretar y of s
tate during the time?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes , well, he was  
s
ec retary of 
s
tate of the J ewis h c omm unity.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  what I m ean. 
Yeah.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  It would be better if he would be s ec retary of state. He c ould have done m or e, but 
he didn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yes.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes , he did a lot. Just as  pr oof, in Isr ael there is  a fores t whic h bears his  na
me. 
And every tree was  planted for  a pers on he s aved. So he s aved in the hundr eds  if not in the thous ands .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A tr ee planted for ever y one of thos e.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes . And he s topped
 
it by bribing, by interfering with the pr oc ess
. H
e st
opped it by 
various  m ethods. For exam ple, in one point in time, it was  dec r eed they would depor t everybody below 
a certain age and not mar ried. So he arranged for m ass  m arr iages for everybody.
 
 
In his  diar ies , whic h are, by the way, pres er ved in Is rael
 
--
 
a major histor ic al doc um ent in both 
the r es ear c h and in the trials  agains t Nazis , es pecially Eic hmann in Israel. There are var ious  anec dotes  
of what he did, anec dotes  whic h for  a rabbi ar e, how to put it m ildly, unus ual.
 
For example, he 
ar r anged
 
--
 
and I alm ost quote. He arr anged for a woman of polite morals  to engage one of the people 
in the gover nm ent.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Not exac tly what you expec t a rabbi to do.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Right. Right.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  But it was  very effective.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  in his diar y.
 

6 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  That's  in his  diar y. So I am not inventing it. If anybody wants  to know it, you c an 
find it in the diary. You may have diffic ulty reading it. It's in various  languages , none of them Englis h, 
ob
vious ly.
  
> > Bill Bens on:  You s har ed with m e, Gideon, c opies  of doc um ents from a government c ens us  of Jews  

in Slovakia that inc luded you and your fam ily in the c ens us doc ument. How s ignific ant were thos e 
c ens us  doc um ents ?
 

> > Gideon Frieder:  In 1942, the Slovak  fas c ist gover nm ent allied with Ger m any c onducted the c ensus  
of the J ews . At the tim e, in order to find, A, wher e are the J ews  to be able to deport them, to be able to

Czec hos lovakia was  independent. Eventually it bec am e part of the Rus s ian s phere of

When the c ommunis ts took  over , they took  all the ar c hives  of the fas c ist gover nm ent and put 
them in boxes , not arr anged by file, jus t put them in boxes . One unit of the

Slovak governm ent, of the for eign m inis ter of Slovak  government, c alled Unit 14, was the one

I was  tasked with trying to m ake s ens e of it. So what I did for many weeks , I put over 
micro
films  page by page by
 
page and created a databas e of all the loc ations  wher e the people wer e.
 
Regr etfully, the m us eum has  not yet been able to digitize thes e m ic rofilm s . It's a gigantic  amount of 

work. And ther e are other  things whic h have priority over thos e. But onc e they di
gitize them, I will be 
able to us e the databas e s o that
 
when a per s on comes  and s ays  who was in this plac e, I c an find it on 
the c omputer , the lis t of names .
 
 
While doing it, I found mys elf ther e. I found mys elf. I found m y m other. I found my s is ter . In th
e 
databas e. And, again, I use it in my lec tures .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Gideon, the Slovak national upris ing took  place August
 
1944. It had an immediate 
effect on you and your fam ily and your c ommunity. Tell us about the upr is ing and what it led to for you 

and 
your  family.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  In 1944, it was  c lear to anybody that Ger m any would los e the war . It was  after the 
invas ion. It was  after the big offens ive of the Rus sians  in the 
e
as ter n front. And the Slovaks  dec ided it 
m ay be better to be on the s ide of
 
the vic tors and not on the s ide of the loser s . You don't have to be a 
r ocket s c ientist for that.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  So, ther e was  an upr is ing agains t the fas c is t gover nment.
 
 
Again, his toric ally ver y inter esting bec aus e it was  one of the few c as es in the his tor y of the 
Sec ond Wor ld War that par tis ans s pons or ed by the Soviet, Comm unis t par tis ans, and partis ans  
s pons ored by the Allied For c es  c ooperated together . Us ually they didn't like eac h other.
 
 
The Czec hoslovakia gover nm ent in exile was  in London. And the Rus s ians  had their  own 
interes ts .
 
So ther e was  a c oordinated upris ing agains t the Germ ans and the Slovak gover nm ent fell.
 
 
If you want to understand war , you look  at a map. And if you look at a m ap, you s ee that the 
G
erm ans 
c ould not afford to have that part of Europe, not fr iendly to Germany. So they invaded from  
the South to take over the terr itory.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And to cr us h
 
--
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  To crush the upris ing, whic h they eventually did. It was  done not only by Ger mans . 
The 
large amount
 
--
 
not am ount. The large part of the forc e whic h fought on the s ide of the Germans  
were Ukr ainians , which fought as part of the Waffen SS, the militar y part of the SS.
 
They took  over 
Slovakia. It was  c lear that all is  over
; t
hat all the ties  with the Slovak  government have no value 
anym or e. There's  no Slovak government. All the pr otective m ec hanis ms  and all the ways  to deal with 
the Germans, inc luding bribing, whic h was  done dur ing the Slovak fas c is t gover nm ent
 
--
 
ther e was  a 
Germ an delegation there and they were br ibed. All of that was  over .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Onc e the Ger mans  were in.
 

7 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Once the Ger man m ilitary took  over . And everything c hanged. My fam ily, 
obvious ly, was  tar geted.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I would im agine your father  would have been at the top of alm ost every lis t.
 

> > Gideon Frieder:  My father would be at the top of the lis t. He knew ver y , very well that if we are 
found with him , we would be killed.
 
 
You m ay not know it but the German SS did not believe ver y m uc h in Mir anda rights.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Gideon Frieder:  They jus t took  you and killed you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you had to flee.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  We had to flee. And he knew if we flee with him it would be the end.
 
So he took his  
wife, his  s on, m ys elf, and my s is ter, and put us  in an ambulanc e and s ent the ambulanc e out of town 
towar d the Ger m an lines . Nobody would look at the ambulanc e obvious ly going towar ds  the German 
lines . Nobody's  fleeing
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Towar ds the Germ ans .
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Once the
 
am bulanc e was  out of town, it obvious ly tur ned. So the way we fled from  
Nove Mesto, wher e we lived. And he fled s epar ately.
 
 
My m other and I fled
 
--
 
we wer e in this  am bulanc e. Eventually the ambulanc e br oke down. I 
don't know how s he found a hors e, whic h was  hitc hed to the ambulanc e, and we went a bit more. 
Eventually we went into the m ountains
 
an
d walked.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you've told me about that trip. You r em em ber  s om e of it bec aus e you wer e a child.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Oh, I r emember  it. It was  a fantas tic trip.What's better than a c hild going in the 
m ountains, eating
 
--
 
not blueberr ies . There were no blue
berr
ies. Som e kind of berry. It was  fantast
ic . 
We wer e gr eeted by various  shepherds. We had milk, cheese. I was not awar e of a danger. I was 7 
ye
ar s  old.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  lik e an adventur e for you.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  For m e it was . It was  not for m y mother, I'm s ure.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Not at all.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  And c lear ly
 
--
 
not c lear ly but I don't think  for m y s is ter, les s  than 4 year
s old. S o it 
was  diffic ult. But we went thr ough the mountains . We were greeted by the s hep
h
er ds . We were guided 
by them. We s lept over  in this  little Shepherd's huts .
 
Eventually we got to Bans ka Bys tr ic a and were 
greeted by the large c ommunity of refugees .
 
She was  the wife of Rabbi Fr ieder , very well
-
known. So 
we wer e given a plac e to live and s o on.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was Bans ka Bys tr ic a in the m ountains ? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Bans ka Bys tr ic a is on the foot of the m ountains. It's the end of the plain, of the 
s outhern plain of Slovakia whic h is  the breadbask et of Slovakia and Czec hos lovakia.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And was it perc eived that it was  going to be a relatively s afe plac e for  ever ybody to 

gather ? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  That was  the c enter of the uprising.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  And the upris ing, the people were very optim is tic . They didn't r ealize the c rus hing 
forc e of the Waffen SS whic h was a
 
--
 
very highly m obile, highly tr ained and for  the Uk rainians  very 
r uthles s type of military operati
ons. The Ukrainians  for  me were far m ore ruthles s  than the Germ ans.
 
So nobody thought it would be c r us hed. Ther e wer e airplanes landing in an air port outs ide Bansk a 
Bys tric a. I don't r em ember  the name now. I m ay rec all it. The air planes  would bring pr ovis i ons  and 
ar m am ents, ammunition and s o on.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Com ing from  the allies ?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Coming fr om  the allies . N
ot from  the Russians. Fr om the W
estern part. The 
Rus s ians  were just on the other s ide of the m ountains . Everybody thought the Russ ians will c om e to 
the aid of the Slovaks, but the Rus s ians wer e m or e than happy to fight to the las t Slovak  bec aus e they 
alr eady had obvious ly their  plans  to over take it and didn't want to have any or iginal
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They just s at outs ide?

>> 
Gideon Fr ieder:  They jus t s at outs ide and let the Germans kill the par tis ans . True. If you r ead the 
his tor y.
 
 
In the later  par t of m y c areer , or beginning of my car eer, I was  part of the Israeli m ilitary 
es tablis hment in r es ear ch and development. So I lear ned a lot about weaponry, logistic s  and s o on.
 
This  is ver y s imple and ver y c allus .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As a result, wer e you in Banska Bys tr ic a for  a s hort while?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  So we wer e in Banska Bys tric a thinking that that would be the end of it. I
 
didn't 
think
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your mother and everybody els e.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  She was  very ac c epted by the c ommunity. She got to meet the guy who eventually 

s aved my life, Henry Herzog, the partis an who s aved m y life who was  a Polis h J ew who fought
 
as  part 
of the Slovak partis ans . So he was  par t of the partisan gr oup in Banska Bys tric a.
 
 
When the Germ an arm ored unit were in Zvolen, where I was  bor n, whic h was  a ver y s hort 
dis tanc e as far  as  m obile units  go, from Banska Bys tric a, it was  c lear that ever ything would be c r ushed. 
The partis ans didn't have any weaponry whic h c ould s tand up to ar mor ed units .We're not talking about 
tanks . You k now, armored c ar s or c ar rier s. Couldn't s tand agains t it. Didn't have the fir e power . So they 
had to evacuate. And that's what we did. 
 
 
My m other approac hed Henr y, Adam
 
--
 
by the way, one of my gr ands ons, Gony's  s on, is 
c alled Adam and the other  is  c alled after m y father . She appr oac hed him . He hes itated bec aus e taking 

two little c hildren and a woman with a fighting group was  not the optimal thing to do but eventually s he 
pr evailed and he took  us with him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So with the partis ans  you fled Bans ka Bys tr ic a.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  We fled with the partis ans  to the north.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Up to the mountains .
 
>
>  Gideon Fr ieder:  To the mountains  where the pa
rtis ans eventually es tablis hed thems elves  and 
s tayed there until the end of the war .
 
 
We wer e c aught in a mountain pas s age, in a place c alled Star e Hor y. And ther e was  a big 
m as s acre ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Gideon, if you don't m ind, will you s pend a little bit of time telling us  about what 
happened ther e at Star e Hor y? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Ok . So Stare Hory is  a little, little Hamlet. I won't call it even a village. Today it's  
bigger but at the tim e. It's  in a m ountain pas s age. When I s ay mountain pas s age, it's a gorge really. It's 
not a wide valley. In the gorge there was  a little str eam, a br ook , and a dirt road. That was  it.
 
The Germ ans  attack ed with airplanes
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e's  a fair ly large grou
p of you in ther e r ight?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  It was  a ver y large group. Ever ybody was  fleeing. Cars, hors es , people on foot.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you and your mother with them.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  My m other , m y s ister and I together with Henr y's  group. And
 
we went on the little 
dir t r oad. So here is the dir t r oad
. T
o the left of it is  the br ook  and then to the right is  the m eadow going 
up into the mountains . Ver y, very narr ow.
 
 
The Germ ans  attack ed by air planes . They knew what they wer e doing. They bombed the exit 
and they bombed the entr ance to the gorge. So everybody who was  ther e c ouldn't m ove out
, couldn't 
m ove in. They s tr afed ever ybody with m achine guns . It was  a m as s acre.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Inc luding killing your  m other  and your  sis ter .
 

> > Gideon Friede
r:  My m other  and my s ister were killed. I didn't k now they were dead. In the m oment 

we hear d the s hooting, we s tarted to flee fr om the dir t r oad up to get into the trees , to be s helter ed by 
the tr ees.We alm os t got to the trees when we were hit. Ther e was
 
a big c onfus ion. Ever ybody was 
r unning
, b
lood and s houting and c rying, mour ning.
 
 
I stopped at the edge of the mountain. As  a matter
 
of fac t, I k now exac tly where I s
topped 
bec aus e when I went with m y family bac k , we found the plac e. And m y c hildr en built
 
a little m em orial 
ther e.
 

9 
 
 
So we wer e fleeing. They wer e hit
. M
y m other  was  lying on her  back  with her  eyes  open. I 
was  les s  than 7 years  old. I didn't k now that s he was  dead. My s is ter was  lying on her fac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And s he was  jus t 3 years old.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  She was  4 year s old.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  4 year s  old.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  3 years  old. 3 year s old. Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you were
 
ther e, too.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I was  there. I was hit. I was luc ky. It's kind of funny to s ay you are lucky when your  
m other  is killed but I was  lucky in the sens e that I got two fles h wounds
,  
two bullets . And they wer e 
fles h wounds . They didn't s ever any m ain arter y. They didn't s ever  any m ain ner ve. They didn't s hatter 

the bone. They wer e s uper
fic ial f
le
s h wounds .
 
 
Now, in Eur ope at the time
, 
c hildren my age, boys  my age, didn't go with long pants. Right
? 
Bec aus e long pants  were a s ign of m aturity. So I had s hort pants. But it was  ver y c old. So what do 

c hildren do
? 
Boys , girls, does n't matter, had ver y thick, wool s tockings. And the wool s tockings were 
then full of the blood and it was  c old so they wer e s oaked in blood and the blood c oagulated bec aus e of 

the c old weather. It cr eated a pr es s ure bandage, exac tly what you ar e told to do when you are in a 
co
m bat s ituation. Som ebody's  wounded, you put a pres s ur e bandage. That's what happened. That's 
what s aved m y life.
 
 
Henr y, Adam, was  fleeing as  well together with another partis an r unning up. The other 
par tis an was  hit by a bullet and fell on Henry. Henr y was below him  and that's what s aved his  life. The 
other guy was  dead.
 
 
When it was  all over, when the airplanes  left, Henr y found m e s tanding next to my mother 
c r ying. I didn't know why s he's  not getting up. So he took me away and told me that s he will c om e 
later.
 

This  is s omething ver y interesting. I thought
 
--
 
I always thought that he took
 
m e from  ther e and brought 
m e to 
this  hous e
,  
to a little village
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The one we s aw?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  The one you s aw, to thes e two wonder ful people known as Str yc har s zyk. He took  

m e fr om the m as s ac re s ite and put me ther e. Always  what I r emember, I rem em ber  that they took m e. I 

r em em ber they tended to m y wounds . That's what I r em ember.
 
 
Many, m any year s  later I m et him  her e in the United States  and he had his m emoirs. I was  
ins tr um ental in publis hing them  eventually. He wr ote them in Englis h. And I was  ins trum ental in 
publis hing them .
 
And I r ead the part about m e and I dis c over ed that all I remembered was  inc orr ec t. I 
was  not taken from  ther e to Bully, to
 
the Hamlet called Bully. Ever ything about the m other and s o on 
was  c or rec t but I was not taken fr om ther e to Bully . He took m e to the m ountains  with him and I spent 

s even days  ther e. Seven days  which don't exis t in m y memor y. They are not part of m y life.
 
I cannot tell 
you anything about them. And he does n't wr ite ver y muc h about it. He is pas s ed away now.
 
 
He just s aid
 
--
 
eventually  they dec ided to take a 7
-
year
-
old boy
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They wer e regrouping as a fighting
 
--
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  They wer
e regrouping. That this  is  not a
 
plac e for a
-
year
-
old boy. So
 
he and 
another partis an took me
. A
nd that's another  s tor y. But that week is  non
-
exis tent. He didn't even know 
that I was wounded. Everybody was  covered with blood. I was  c over ed with blood. Big deal, everybody 

was .
 
 
When I c am e to the village, they dis c over ed I was  wounded. Es s entially that Hamlet thes e 
wonder ful people, s aved not only me but m any other s . Among them they saved a J ewis h 
ophthalm ologis t, m edic al doc tor  but ophthalm ologis t, and he took  c are of m y wounds .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did they c ome to pick  Bully has  the plac e to take you and how did they pick the 
Stryc har s zyk fam ily to take you in? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Let m e tell you im mediately how and you will s ee the analogue.
 
For a while,
 
I would 
like you to know, I was abs olutely, without any doubt, the bes t Slovak s peaker  in the m us eum. You 
know why
? 
There was  only one.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

10
 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  The s am e s tory with Bully. That was  the plac e whic h was  c los es t to the mountains .
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  The only one. Ok .
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  The hous e of Paulina and J ozef wer e the fir s t one on the outskirts . So they c ould 
obs er ve it and s ee that there is  nobody there, no Germ ans, and ther efor e they appr oac hed it. It was  the 
natural choic e bec aus e it was  the only c hoic e.
 
 
There was  a sm aller village on the top of the mountain but they s elected this  one bec aus e this 
was  a Hamlet, not a village, 40, 50 huts. Not even hous es . What you s ee in the pictur e is  a modern 

pic ture. Ther e was  no window in
 
the hut. It was  a warped out pig skin. If you warp pig skin ver y finally, 
it's  trans parent. And, by the way, it's a very good ins ulator. Ther e ar e two layers  ins tead of glas s.
 
So they picked it bec ause it was  r emote. It didn't have a German Gar ris on. And 
they picked the fir st 
house.
 
 
And again, your r ec ollec tion and what is  the truth is  s ometimes not the s ame. My r ec ollec tion 
was  I c am e to the hous e. And I don't r em em ber  anything but c ar e and love from this. They tr eated m e 
well. And I have s om e proof of it later whic h I will not s har e with you today bec aus e eventually we will 
have to stop. I have a c omm itment at 9:00
 
tomorrow m or ning but you pr obably want to leave ear lier 
than that. I'm her e.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  I r emem ber  only that they cared for me. I was  alway s  fed. I was  always  hungry 

bec aus e everybody was  hungr y but I was  fed. I was  fed as m uc h as they wer e, m aybe more. They 
c ar ed for me. They did myriad things to s ave my life.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would end up s taying with them.
 
>> 
Gideon Fr ieder:  I ended up staying with them. And, indeed, we went bac k , my family and I, to m eet 
the people who saved my life. They were alr eady dead. We m et the daughter. Ther e ar e var ious  proofs  
fr om  ther e, fr om  the dis cus s ions , that they r eally c ar ed about me.
 
 
What Henry wrote in his  mem oirs  is  that he and another partis an c ame to the village, to the 
Ham let, obs er ved it. Since ther e was  nobody there, the firs t hous e whic h was  Paulina and J ozef's 
hous e, and told them
, ﬁ Y
ou c an take this  kid and keep it. His  father  is a very well
-
known guy. You will 
be rewarded do it. Or if you don't do it, we kill you.
ﬂ  
 
It was  a c lear c hoic e. Was n't it
? 
I'd say.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  From  that s tor y you would think they did it r eluc tantly. I don't believe s
o. I r eally 
believe
 
--
 
as  I told you, if we had m or e time I c ould pr ove it to you, logic ally
 
--
 
that they it bec aus e they 
thought it's the r ight thing to do.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Will you s hare with us , Gideon, what you told m e about
 
--
 
to keep you safe
 
--
 
bec aus e, 
at that time, of c ours e, the Germ an Arm y is  hunting the partis ans . I believe there's  Uk rainian tr oops  
als o pr owling through the m ountains  going the same.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  And hunting the J ews .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And hunting the J ews . It was  a ver y, very danger ous  place. You're not from that 

Ham let s o your  pres enc e there was out of the ordinary. What did they do to protec t you
? 
You told me 
about one inc ident, one s ituation, wher e they told you to say s om ething.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  They did a c ouple of
 
things. Fir s t of all, they c am e in, they gave me a new name.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J an Suche.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  J an Suc he. J an is  a very, ver y Slavic , Eur opean nam e. I m et a young man here 
fr om  Germany whos e nam e is J an.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So ver y s afe nam e.
 
>
>  Gideon Fr ieder:  Ver y s afe nam e. And Suc he is a very Slav
ic
-
s ounding name. Ver y funny i
n a s ens e
 
b
ec aus e Suc he in Slovak  means  dry and I was  not dr y. I was  a m es s . I was  wet.
 
 
So I was  J an Suc he. And I was  s uppos edly the son of the br other of the wom an. 
And the 
br other, allegedly, was  killed by the partis ans . So they c reated for m e a pres enc e of s om ebody who 
s hould hate the partis ans  and like the Ger mans. Right
? 
Bec aus e my poor father
.

 T
hat's one thing.
T
he other  thing they told m e, they taught me s ometh
ing
, s o
m e kind of 
m antra. I didn't under s tand a s ingle word. Didn't understand a s ingle word. They told m e it m eans
 
--
 
the 
family will as k, you s ay this , s ay that. So often the fam ily as k m e to s ay this , s ay that. And the guy who 
as ked me would kind of pat
 
m e on the head
, ﬁ
Very nic e boy.
ﬂ  
> > Bill Bens on:  Good r es pons e.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  That was  the end of it. Only far later, far  later , by the help of Gony, by the way , I 

found out that what they taught m e was  The Lor d's  Prayer.
 
 
Now, you have to
 
r ealize 
in 1944, the Catholic  Chur c h us ed Latin in its liturgy. Ther e wer e 
only three things that people knew in the language of the c ountr y and I think  that thes e people knew 
only two out of the thr ee. 
The f
ir s t thing is  The Lord's  Prayer , "Our  father." The s ec on
d thing is Hail 
Mary, "Ave Mar ia." Those I'm s ur e they knew. The third is  a nic e 
c
r edo, "I believe in J es us ." I don't think  
they knew it. But they taught m e, however , The Lord's Pr ayer
 
but the way they r ec ited it, all the wor ds  
were blurr ed, one into another. Only later  I realized what they did.
 
 
Think about this  totally uneducate
d, 
s uperbly intelligent people. You do r ealize there's  a 
differ ence between education and intelligenc e. Educ ation is  a privilege. Intelligenc e is a gift. And they 
were gifted. They
 
understood what has to be done in thos e very diffic ult days  to s ave a c hild.
 
I was  
s uppos ed to be the fir st J ew they had s een in their life but they understood what to do.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Why
 
--
 
do you have any thoughts as  to why the other villagers , maybe out of their  own 
fear s, wouldn't have denounc ed you or denounc ed the fam ily? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  
D
o I have a knowledge
? 
No. Obviously I don't have a knowledge. Do I think I 
know? 
Yes . Do I think  ver y s tr ongly
? 
Yes .
 
 
Sorr y. They wer e true to their  faith. For them to take a c hild to be killed was  unthinkable. In a 
c ountry where a Catholic  pr ies t was  a pr es ident who s old jewels  for  m oney, of the Germans
. T
hese 
were the tr ue Chr is tians .

There was  an oc c urr ence whic h happened later. And I have to s ay it bec aus e it c omes to the 
point. The 
people who saved me died. I met, together with m y family, the daughter. The daughter  was  
bor n s ever al days  after  I left. All the time I was  there I believed that the wom an was  fat.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Gideon Frieder:  It turns  out s he was  not. She was  like this . At least fr om the desc ription of her 
daughter. She gave birth s ever al days  after I left. We met the daughter. 
 
 
Eventually the daughter had a str oke. She was  par aly zed. I c am e back  to vis it her . I c am e 
bac k  to vis it her.
 
When we m et the fir st tim e wit
h m y fam ily, s he talked about her  parents and s he s aid 
that they wanted to keep m e and if s he meets m e anytime in the futur e, s he s hould tr eat m e like a 
br other. That was  her stor y.
 
 
Now s he's  par alyzed. I come back . I find out that the family is  in financ ial need. That was  
before Slovakia
 
--
 
the Eur opean Union. And for a c ouple of Amer ic an dollars  you c ould buy a fortune 
ther e. So they needed help. So I told Anna, her nam e, 
ﬁ
I will help you financ ially
. W
e will m ake 
ar r angements.
ﬂ 
She looked at m e and said, "Abs olutely not." I s aid
, ﬁWh
at do you mean not
? 
Your  
par ents told you that I am  like your  brother. Br others  and s is ter s help each other. What do you m ean 
abs olutely not
?ﬂ  
She s aid
, ﬁ No
. ﬂ 
She s aid, "If I accept help fr om you, it m ay mean that m y pa
r ents 
s aved you for  a r eward. They didn't. They s aved you for [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language]." Which 
m eans  Chris tian love. "They s aved you bec aus e it's what God told them ."
 
 
And I looked at her
 
--
 
you may not know it but par t of m y c hecker ed pas t I did s o
m e 
r eas onably advanc ed work in logic s . Som e of my paper s  fr om the 1970s  are still referenc ed today. It 

was  reas onably good work.

> > Gideon Frieder:  That's  what they tell m e.

> > Gideon Frieder:  So I look at this  wom an. I was  s
hocked. I was  totally flabbergas ted. I told mys elf, 
Gideon, if you with your knowledge of logic  c annot c onvinc e this wom an to take the help, then 
ever ything you did in your  life is just piec e of crap written on a paper. No value whats oever. This is  the 
tim
e. You have to do s om ething.
 
 
It didn't c om e easy. For me it s eem ed like eternity. It was  sec onds  but I r eflected. I thought
 
--
 
I 
was  los t. Finally I told her, 
ﬁ
Anna, do you believe in God
?ﬂ  
Now, to ask  Anna if she believes  in God is  
like to ask  you if you'r e breathing. So I s aid, 
ﬁO
bviously you do. How do you know,
ﬂ  
I told her
, 
 ﬁ
that God 
didn't bring me to your par ents s o that now I'll be able to help you
?ﬂ 

 
And now it was  her  turn
 
to
 
be flabbergasted. But she didn't s tudy logic .
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Gideon
 
Fr ieder:  She was  more logic al than that. So s he did the only thing that a woman like her c an 
do. She s ent her daughter  to the village priest. Now
,  
they are not in Bully anym or e. The larger  village 
ther e's  a c hurc h, there's a pries t. Now
,  
the c ouple of m inutes  till the daughter  c am e back for me was  
eter nity. Poss ibly no m ore than 10, 15 m inutes. For  m e it was  a lifetim e. 
 
 
The daughter  c om es back . I talked to m ys elf: I hope that this  pries t is r eally wor th its 
or dination.
 
The daughter c ame back  and s aid, "The pr ies t s aid that we don't know how God oper ates  
but this  s eem s  like he would do it
. 
Get the help money." And s he did. And for a while we s uppor ted the 
family. For us  it was
 
--
 
I don't want to boas t about it. For us  it was  r eally peanuts . For them it wa
s  a lot.

> > Gideon Frieder:  We ar e out of time.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We ar e not out of tim e. And m y logic  is prevailing here.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Yes . He's the bos s.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You do have to tell us about at the end of the war reuniting with your  father.
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  Well he, Adam, the partis an, ever y tim e he m et a J ew anyplac e, partis an, J ew or  
others, he would tell them know that the s on 
--
 
the wife and daughter of Rabbi Frieder was  killed, an
d 
his  s on is  in this  Ham let c alled Bully. The rumor s  s pread through the J ewis h c omm unity. My father who 

was  c aught by the end of the war  but not rec ognized was  in a jail together with another J ew who didn't 
r ec ognize him  either.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So they kn
ew
 
--
 
they didn't know he was  Rabbi Frieder .
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  They knew he was  a J ew but not Rabbi Frieder. He was  arr es ted. And in the jail he 

was  told, 
ﬁY
ou know that the wife of Rabbi Fr ieder was  killed
?ﬂ  
It's all des cr ibed in this book of his , book  
about him, whic h was , by the way, publis hed in Englis h. So he k new there
.  A
fter the war he s ent 
em is s ar ies  to the village and took  me. And I was  reunited with him . He died a year  after  that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A year  after  that at age 39?
 
> > Gideon Frieder:
  
36. He was  age 36. He left his  diar ies , whic h, as I s aid, are his tor ical doc uments  in 
the arc hive in Is r ael.We had s c ads of c opies  of them. There was  a book  publis hed bas ed on them .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you s aid, his  diar ies  have even been us ed in tr
ials .
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  His  diaries  c ontain a large number of or iginal doc uments . You c annot get to them. 

They ar e kept in the arc hives  in a c ontr olled environm ent but there are s c ans  and you c an r ead the 
s c ans . This  book  whic h was  publis hed in Hebr ew, E nglis h, and Slovak bas ed on the diar ies .
 
 
So after  the war , in Eur ope and in the United States, as you well know, ther e was  an abs olute 
epidemic  of m ar r iages. Everybody wanted to rebuild their  lives
. T
he baby boom er s, right
? 
He marr ied 
as  well. And befor e he died he s wore his  wife, m y s tepm other
, 
to take m e out of that, quote, bloody 
c ontinent. We c ame in c landes tine imm igr ation. The Br itis h c alled it illegal im m igr ation. Ther e's nothing 
illegal to c om e hom e. So we c alled it c landes tine im migr ation. The J ew
is h underground arranged for us 
to c om e. And I was  r ais ed and educ ated her e.

Firs t Pers on
 
that our Fir st Pers on has the las t word.
 
 
We didn't have ti

as k  Gideon any ques tions that you have, s hake his  hand, get a picture taken with him  if you'r e ok  with 
that. Gideon will be here.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e. I r em ind you we will have
 
Firs t Pers on
 
pr ogr ams  eac h 
Wednes day and Thur s day until the m iddle of August.
 
 
Gideon, thank  you, thank  you, thank  you. I wis h we had had more tim e. I k now you do 
bec aus e you have an appointm ent at 9:00
 
tom orrow m or ning but I think  we have to let our  audience go. 
Your
 
final thoughts ? 
 
> > Gideon Frieder:  There is  very little tim e and I don't want to detain you. Try to stand on the s houlders  
of Giants and quote other s .
 
 
A wise m an once s aid the Holoc aus t was  not a childhood diseas e

they are not identifying as J ews  anym ore bec aus e they will be har med. It's  all happening 
again. It was  not a c hildhood dis eas e. We are not imm une from it. 
 
 
You will look at me and say, So what c an we do
? 
Again, let me
 
s tand on the s houlders of 
Giants. Arguably one of the most beloved pr es idents  we had in the s ec ond part of the 20th Century was  
J ohn Fitzgerald Kennedy. Pres ident Kennedy was  quoted to s ay, "The hottes t plac es in hell ar e

the values  on whic h we stand, for  the s ak e of your c hildr en, don't res er ve thos e plac es .
 
 
Thank  you.
