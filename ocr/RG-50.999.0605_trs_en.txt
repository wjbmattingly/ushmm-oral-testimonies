W e ha ve

Margit was born Margit Morawetz on February
 
26, 1922, in Innsbruck, Austria.W hen 
Margit was a baby, her fam ily m oved to Prague, Czechoslovakia.T he arrows on thism ap of  

1933 Europepoint to Austria and Czechoslovakia. 
 
 
Prague is identif ied onthis mapof  Czechoslovakia.
 
 
Here we see Margit at theage of 3. She was the youngestof four children born to 
Gottlieb and Lily Morawetz. Gottlieb, seen here, was a bankerf rom a religious 
J e wi s h  f a m il y .
 
 
Here we see Margit's fam ily at the Lido,a beach resort in Venice, in 1926. From the 
left areherbrother, Felix, her cousin
, 
Ernie Morawetz, her brother
,  
Bruno, her m other and 
father, Margit pictured here, her governess Yeya andher brother, Paul.
 
 
Margit's f ather, Gottlieb, passed away in 1932
,  wh
en Margit was 10 years old
. In
 
1938
, 
w
hen Margit was 16, attacks on Jews in Central Europe escalated and her mother decided she 
 

2 
 
should leave school in Prague. Margit was sent to Paris to live with a Frenchf am ily where she 
studied dressm aking.
 
 
In March1939, Margit's mother joinedher inFrance.T his is Margit with her dog Flippy 
just before leaving Prague in 1938.
 
 
As the Germ ans were advancing onParis, Margit's m other was ordered to report 
t o a n 
assembly point in the south. Margit boughtabike andf led with other refugees to the South of  

France. Margitf oundout thatherm other was at the Gurs DetentionCam p, shown here in this 

photograph.She eventually got a train ticket to a town outside
 
of  G ur s .
 
 
W hen France surrendered to Germany in June
 
1940, Margit's m other was able to 
leave Gurs in all the confusion and join Margit. Thetwo f led via Spain and Portugal tothe 

United States where they settled in 1941.
 
Inthis photo, we see Margit in 19
41, soon af ter she 
arrived in the UnitedStates.
 
 
T oday, Margit leads tours in all of them useum 's exhibits and speaks in various 
settings about her Holocaust experience. Recently she spoke to Congress to call attention to 

the Syrian refugee crisis. Margit
 
also works in them useum 's archives translating docum ents 
f rom  Czech andGerman to English.And she gi ves tours inf ive different languages.
 
 
In 2003, Margit's autobiography, " Margit's Story,"  was published. If you are interested 
in purchasing a copy ofher book, you may order copies in thebookstore after theprogram.
 
 
W ith that, I would like you 
to  
joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Margit Meissner.
 
>>
 
[Applause] 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
Thank youfor the applause.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
Margit, you were born in Austria and yourfam ily m oved to Prague in 
Czechoslovakia when you were ver y young. You lived there until 1938. So why don't we start 

by you talking about your lif e in Prague, yourfam ily, and what your childhood there was like.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So, as you saw, I was one off our children, theyoungest.W e were a 
we l l
-
to
-
do, very assim ilated Jewish fam ily that spoke Germ an athome but Czech in the 
streets.And because I was a youngest of four children,m y brother
s 
thoughtthat I was a little 
d o ll 
and they treatedme like a little doll.All they wantedtodo was kiss m e. And Ihated it. 
Fortunately I have overcom e that hatred asI grew older.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
I  wa s
 
--
 
m y m ain task inthe world was to learn. I was supposed
 
--
 
we  
we n
t to school six days a week, including Saturday, f rom 8:00
 
inthe m orning until 1:00. And 
then af ter I came home from  school, in the afternoon, I had private lessons in English, in 

French, in Tennessee in writing, whatever one could learn m y mother thought
 
wa s  ve r y 
im portant for m e to know.
 
 
I had basically a ver y happy childhood, although I continuously f eltpressuredbutI 
thought that's how all children grew up. I didn't know any better.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
And tell us a little bit about your parentsand how life changedaf ter 
your f atherpassed away.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So m yf ather was a banker, originally f rom a sm all town in Moravia.He 
was f rom an Orthodox Jewish f am ily. But thefam ily was ver y poor and there was nohigh 

school in his town, so he was sent toVienna, which was the capitalof  the Austro
-
Hungarian 
Em pire, and he hadtosupport him self  by tutoring other students to go through high schooland 

law school. 
 

 
Andhe was very succ essful as abanker. And when the new country of  
Czechoslovakia 
was cr eated,at theend ofWorldW arI, andthe country had to create a new 

3 
 
currency
 
--
 
because whena new country is created, they need anew m onetary system  
--
 
m y 
father was asked to com e to Prague to help create themonetary sys tem. So that's how we 
m ov
ed to Czechoslovakia. And I was never quite sure whether I was Austrian or Czech, but 
fortunately when I came to the United Statesthatdilemm aended becauseI becam ean 

Am erican.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So you were living i n Prague in the 1930s.W ere youaware of  what 
was going on in Germany, of  the riseof  theNazis at thattim e?
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, somewhat aware. One has to realize that at thattim e there were no 
m edia.T oday if you want to f ind out what goes on in the world, you look at the cellpho
ne and 
you know im m ediately what goes oneve
rywh ere.W e had none of  this. 
I thinkf or the young 
people here, the ideathat there was no televi sion, no com puter,nocell phone,that seem s like 

an impossible world but that's the world that Igre w up in.
 
 
So  
we knew ver y little about what was going on inthe world. But itwas clear that Hitler 
was persecuting Jews in Germany and especially it also was clear that he was trying to isolate 

the Jews in Germ any from  the rest of the population, to make them  into the
 
o the r. T ha t 
seemed very threatening to us.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So in 1938 Hitler annexed Austria and youbecam em uchm ore 
concerned, youand your fam ily, and you andyour m other made adecision that you should 

m ove to Paris. T ell us about that.
 
>> M a r g i t
 
Meissner:
 
W henAustria was annexed, theAustrian Nazis, who were ver y powerful 
at the tim e, were thrilled that they would becom epartof  Germ any. They really tried to show 

their new Germanoccupiers what good anti
-
Sem ites they were. T hey f orced som e elder
l
y 
Jewish peopleto kneel on the sidewalks andscrape away anti
-
Germ an propaganda. And this 
was such af rightening sight, to see old people kneeling, trying to clean the sidewalks with a 

toothbrush.W hen m y m other saw that picture, she decided that it was not safefor me to stay 

there.Although I was in Czechoslovakia thathada democratically elected governm ent that 

protected itspeoplebut she didn't think it was saf e.
 
So shedecidedthat I should leave andgo 
som eplace that wouldbe safer. So theplacewas Paris because I was very interested indress 

design.
 
 
You have tounderstand that in1938, if you wanted a dress,there was no departm ent 
store you went to. You went to adressm aker.Anddressmaking was a very respected 

prof ession.
 
So Paris was thef ashion capital of the world, so motherfound a Frenchfamily that 
was wil ling to takem e in, sortof  likea paying guest. And shefound that family and decided I 

was going to go to Paris.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So, do you recall what it felt likefor you to lea
ve Prague, everythi ng 
you knew, your f am ily, by yourself  at16and go toParis by yourself?And tell usalso how yo u 

m ade the journey toParis.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, so I was 16. I was in 10th grade. I was a very good student.That 
m eant that I got very good grades because Iknew how to taketests butI was not interested in 

learning so Ididn't learn much. I was m ainly i nterested in boys.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
But som eof  theboys that I were interested inwere not so interestedin 
m e. Sothe idea of leaving didn't seem particularly threatening. Also, I had no idea what was 

going to happen next. T he idea that Jews we re going to be deported or that Jews were going 

to be interned in concentration cam psand then gassed in gas chambers was com p
le te ly ou t of 

the question. Nobody had heard anything lik e this.
 

4 
 
 
S o  I  l ef t  P r a gue
 a
nd 
w
as proud thatm y m other had enough conf idence inm e to send 
m eaway b y m yself  toaf oreign country. Andalso, I was going to travel by air, which was t he 
m o st  
sophisticated thing one could do. One wore one's best clotheson theairplane. Little did I 
know that I was going to ride on a non
-
pressuri zes plane. So when Iarrived in Paris, I thought 
m y ears were going to drop off, it hurt som uch.
 
So whenm y French fosterfam ily picked me up 
at the airport, I wasn't even ableto speak becausem y ears were so painful.
 
 
W eknew som ewhatabout what was going on, but the kind of knowl edge thatonehas 
today certainly I didn'thave it. If other peoplehad it, I knew ver y l
it t le .
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
W hat was your day
-
to
-
day lif e like once you arrived in Paris? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, thef am ily thatm other hadfound was a very nice fam ily, had 
youngsters m y age wh o were ver y welcom ing. And because Ihad aFrench nanny at
 
h om e,  I  
spokepretty good French. Butthe lady of  the house was a French teacher and she took it 

upon herself  to makem e intoa perf ect French teacher.SoI hadprivate instructions with the 

lady ever y m orningf orthreehours. Inthe af ternoonI did hom eworkfor her. And in the evening 

I sat inf ront of am irror trying to f ashionm y mouth in such a way that I would be able tomaster 

all the French. Soas
 
a re su lt I r
eally spoke French without aforeignaccent. And that was good 
for the restof m y escape.
 
 
I went todressmaking school.Atf irst I went to a sewing school where I was the worst 
pupil because I was supposed tom ake tiny little stitches andm ake each stitch exactly like the 

next. And I wasn't able to do that. Because most of the girls in that sch
ool had had vocational 

training whereas I had been in a very academic high school.
 
So then I went to pattern m aking 
schoolanddesigning. And that was m uch better.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
W hat was your social life like inParis? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W e ll,  I  h
ad these Frenchf riends. And then there were f riendsf rom  Prague 
who cam e. But most of m y Praguef riends were Czech citizens, so they were not in the sam e 

situation asI was. I, as an Austrian, was suspectf rom  thebeginning. Austria was now partof  

G e r m an
y. So I was anex [Indiscernible]. Andthepolice kept very close track ofm e. I had to 
go to the police every other week to show m y face. And they kept threatening methat if  I ever 

did anything they didn't like, they would arrest m e im mediately. So I sort of had adouble lif e. 

Off icially I was ver y uncomfortable andfelt very threatened. And inm y private lif eI did wel l. I 

had goodf riends.They were ver y kind of me.I enjoyedm y patternmaking studies. I was good 

at it, so I liked it.And I was pleased that I spoke French so well at that point.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So the situation becom es more worrisom ewhen the Nazis occupied 
part of Czechoslovakia. Your m other comes and joins 
yo u
 
in Paris. Tell us about that.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So, there was
 
--
 
t o  be
gin with, after Austria was annexed, the Germ ans 
were surprised that nobody objectedto theannexationof Germany, although France and 

Great Britain could have objected because itwas against an international treaty. But neither 

France nor England were interested in that. And the United Stateswas out of the picture. 
 
 
Am erica, as you
 
know, had the depression and FDR
 
had his own new deal and lots of 
problem s with Congress then, so he was not interested in intervening in Europe.
 
 
So Hitler was emboldenedbecausenobody objected to the annexation of Austria, so 
he decided he was going to take the Germanpart of Czechoslovakia. Of  course, the Czech 

governm ent said you cannot takeour country
 
--
 
part of our country. So Hitler said, well, if  you 
don't give it to 
m e, I'll go  to  wa r.
 
And the Czechs mobilized. But before he started going to war, 
he decided to invite the English primem inister and the French prime m inister to Munich 

without inviting the Czech governm ent.And they decided that Germany could annex part 
of  

5 
 
Czechoslovakia. T hatwas called the MunichAgreem ent which was basically givin g up apart 
of  the world that they had no power over. So the Czech governm enthadto go into exile and a 

puppet government was created in Czechoslovakia.
 
A t tha t po in tm y m o th
er cam e to joinme in 
France.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
W hat was it likef oryou to be in Paris together?W hat happened to 
your houseand your property in Prague? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, when mother cam e to Paris and she cam e in such ahurry that the 
only thing that she could bring with her was one sm all suitcase.That's basically all thatever 

rem ainedof  our really considerableassets. And until then shehad beenableto send me a 

m onthly sum that I could useform y supportbut that was gone. Sobasically we becam e 

penniless overnight and really dependentonhelp.It was ver y worris om e but som ehow we 

m anaged.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman:
 
Did itfeel like war as im m inent? Did youhave a sense of what m ight 
com e? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
Yes. Of  course, then, in September
 
of 1939, the war started. So Germ any 
invaded Poland and that is when France andGreat Britain declaredwar on Germany. So at 

thatpoint we becam eenemy aliens becausewe were Germ ans and France was at war wit h 

Germ any. So we becam eenem y aliens. 
 
 
T he  au t
horities were even m oreaggressi ve against us, so Ihad to go tothe police 
ever y week now to show m y f ace.And they kept saying, "W edon'twant you here," "W edon't 

want all of  these ref ugees here,"  "W hydothey com e to France?
ﬂ ﬁ
W hy don't they go back 
ho
me ?
ﬂ 
So it was very uncomf ortable.
 
 
Of course, we knew what was going on within the am ountof news that we had but 
French propaganda was very strong because they said we hadfortif icationsandthe Germ ans 

would never overcom e France.In the reality, the French were not really wi lling to def end 

them selves. And the Germ ansfirst only f ought onthe easternf ront in Poland. 
 
 
So there was the " Funny 
W
ar"  in France, because France was at war with Germ any 
but there was nof ighting.
 
And when they had f inished, the
 
Polish annexation or conquest,we 
m oved west and they were now going to com eto France. In spiteof  the French propaganda, 

they advanced very ra pidly. 
 

 
Af ter af ew weeks whe n it seemed that France would not defend itself atall, my 
m other, who had come at a differentpoint than I, was sum moned tothepolice.She got a 

noticethat she should com e tothe police station intwo days with wh atever she could carry on 

her back, ina knapsack
,  
two blankets and three days' worth of food, and she was going to be 
de
ported. She was going to be sent away.
 
I went to thepolice station with her.W hen I came 
thereand said why are you arresting her, they said " None of  your business. Go home." And I 

said, "W ell, whereare you taking her?," " None of  your business. Go hom e."
 
 
So here I was by m yself. I hadno idea wherem other was going to be taken. I hadno 
idea what I should do. I was all by m yself  becausem y Czech f riends were not enem y aliens. 

For some reasonalthough Czechoslovakia was asm uch apartof  Germ any as Austria, the 

Czechs were not consideredenem y aliensby the French, so they had am uch easier time.
 
So in the lastm inutes before mother enteredthebus that was going to takeher away, shetook 

som ething out of her pocket and she gave me afew thousandf rancs, which I had no ideashe 

hadbecauseI didn't think we had any m oney. And she said tom e, "Here. Now it's up to you to 

get us out of here."
 
SoI never really knew what she meant by that.
 

6 
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
Just a couple of weeks later, very quickl y, P aris
 
fell. And your life 
changeddram atically. T ell us about that tim e.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, so,here I was by m yself . I was supposed to get usout of here, 
which m eant that certainly I should try andf ind m y mother and get her outof wherever they 
were taking her. And Ialso had to look af term yself because it becam e very clear thatthe 

Germ ans were going to com e to Paris very s oon. I did not know what to do. I tried all kinds of  

wa y s .
 
 
I had one set off riends who were also Austrian. It so happenedthatm y f riend was the 
granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, the psychiatrist, just a coincidence. And the Freudf am ily 

hadem igratedf rom  Austria to England. Somy f riend,Sophie Freud, and hermother who was 

in Paris with m e, they wanted to escape to the northwestern part of France to catch a boat 

f rom  theretoEngland.So when itbecam e a question of leaving Paris, I thought, well, I'll go  

with the Freuds toBrest, which was on the northeastern
 
--
 
northwestern part of France.
 
So  o f  
course, I was notpermitted to leave. So I went to thepolice station and said
 y
ou have to give 
m eperm ission to leave
; 
I have to go f ind m y m other
, n o
 
wa y .
 
 
And then I saw that people f rom Paris were stream ing out of the town in one direction. 
I didn't know they were all going southtoavoid the Germ an Arm y. I looked at the situationand 

s a id
, How can I go by m yself? C
an 
I 
walk wit h the people? 
 
 
T hen itoccurred tom e that I hadthism oney thatm other gave me and Ithought 
m aybe if  I could buy a bicycle, I could leave Paris on a bicycle.
 
So Iwent to buy the last bicycle 
thatthere was in Paris. It was am en's race bike with these kindsof handles. AndI boughtthis 

bicycle. I was not a good bicyclist. I just sortof  knew how to ride abicycle. And Ihad with m e 

what I could put on abaggage carrier. So I had a changeof  underwear, two pound chocolate, 

chocolate croissant, my dressm aking notes,anda box of  oil paint.Because now I was goi ng to 

becom ea designer, I needed these oil paints.
 
 
I went to thepoliceto see now they really had to let me go. And when I cam e tothe 
police station, the police station was openedbut thepolicem en hadjoinedthe chaotic crowd 

that was leaving. So I thoughtI had an alibi. Because I could say I tried to get perm ission but 

the policem en weren't there an
ym ore.
 
SoI started riding.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
T ell usaboutthatf irst day on your journey andalso tell us how yo u 
felt about being this very proper girl on a bike.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So, I was terrif iedbecause I didn't know where I was going
, w
hethe
r  I  wa s  
going in the direction that I wantedto go to. Ijustf ollowed the crowd. It turned out that withm y 

bicycle I was ver y f ortunate because the roads were jam med.Therewas no space that 

anybody could go to.There were stalled cars, people who didn't
 
know how to dri ve, cars that 
ran out of gas, andpeople walking with wheel barrels, with canary cages, baby carriages. It 

was a chaotic sight.
 
But it turnedoutthat I was fortunate because wi th the bicycle I could get 
around the stalled cars. So I made pretty good progress. And I justbicycled. I didn't pay any 

attention toanything. I just kept going. And Iwas al ways glad thatIcould keepmoving 

becausem any other people just stood there.
 
 
So when evening came
 
--
 
I bicycled all evening. W henevening came, we arrived in a 
little town. And the policem anm otioned to me. Now
,  
when a policemanm otioned to me,m y 
heart stopped. Because I said now he's going to ask mef orpapers and Idon't have papers 

andthey are going to arrest m e. But the policem an was ver y kind. He said, "
M ad em
o is e lle
, i f  
you want to spendthenight, you can go tothe school next door and lie down on thef loor in the 

schooland spend thenight." So that was very ni
ce  
of  t he  po l i c e m a n.  
 

7 
 
 
And I didthat. And when I laid down on thef loor of the school, I remem bered 
som ething that just before I leftm y house
;  
som ebody had given m ea letter that Ihadn't 
opened. Iopened the letter and it was f rom  som ebody who knew thatm y m other was in a 
cam p called Gurs.
 
Now, Gurs was just anam enobody had ever heard of. But Gurs was near 
the Pyrenees which meant it was near theSpanishborder.SoI, of course, was thrilled that I 

now had a destinationwhere m y m other was.
 
In them orning I got up atday breakout of the 
school.I didn't know until two days later that the school in which I spent thenight was bombed 

to sm ithereenstwo hours afterI lef t. So I was ver y f ortunate.
 
I kept riding. 
 
 
Af ter af ew m iles I collided with another woman.W ebothfell off our bikes. I lookedat 
m y bike. It was pretty dam aged but I could continue riding. SoI justpickedm yself upand 

continued riding.
 
Suddenly a young m an comes up tom e and said, "Madem oiselle, you can't 
go on like this. You're going to bleed to death. Look at your leg."  And I looked atm y leg and it 

wa s  r e
all y bleeding but I wasn't aware of  it. I didn't notice that it hadbeen cut sobadly. Now 
thatI noticed it, of course, now it startedhurting. Andhe said there is a drug store in thenext 

stop, get that leg bandaged. And I went tothe drug store and he said you have to go to the 

hospital, it has to be sewn. I said, no, I can't go tothe hospital, just bandage it. So he 

bandaged itand thenhe said, "W hyare you riding a bicycle?"  I saidI have to gof indm y 

m other and she's in Gurs. He said "W here isGurs?"  Nobody knew. But it is in the Pyrenees. 

He said," But thereare trains in France."  I said in Paris there were no trains. 
 
 
But inthe South of  France there were trains.So I continued riding and I came to the 
train station.There was, again,a chaotic crowd with hundreds of people waiting in line toget 

the ticket. Andone ticket counter was open. So it was bedlam . And people
 
--
 
babies were 
crying, old ladies weresitting on the ground desperate. It really was alm ost as chaotic as when 

people lef t Paris
.  
In the m iddle of the severalhours, there was air raid alarm s. Everybody was 
supposedto go to the basem ent. I had decided I wasn't going to go to thebasem ent.SoI 

stayed up on the top and again watched thebombsfalling on bothsides of the railroad s
tation. 
Andfortunately nothing happened to me. 
 
 
So I got ona train. Ithought the train was going to be com pletely em pty
 
--
 t
he train 
would be com pletely f illed. I was the only passenger in m y car. I was so scared because itwas 

nighttim e. It was blacked out.It was black,black, black. 
 
 
S o  it ' s  a
 
long story. AsJ
o A
nna told you, I wrote abook aboutm y escape. None of m y 
fam ily knew anything about this.I thoughtI was atthat point theonly survi vor of m y generation 

in m y fam ily, that these various children should know.
 
 
So I arrived
 
--
 
I took this train which I thoughtwas going northwest and the train was 
going southwest. Andwhen I arrived to aplace where I knew I hadsom e acquaintances, it 

turned out I was 20

JoAnna W asserm
an :  
T ell usabout whenyou got off  thetrain. You went to yourf riend's 
house. T ell us about what happened then.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So,m y f riends we ver y helpful.T hey really tried tohelp me. Andthe lady 
of  the house had a car,
 
and although it was not perm itted to drive private cars, shef ound Gurs. 
Shealso didn't know that itexisted. Shefound Gurs.She went toGurs and triedtof indm y 

m other. And she came backand she said, 
L
ook, I couldn'tf ind her. I lef t a message
; s
he wi
ll 
never hear about itbecause it was too chaotic. 
 

 
Som y f riends could not put me up sothey said there is apeasant lady who has an 
attic room  in the house, shem ight rent you this attic room . SoI wentto the attic room .I had 

8 
 
th e  little ca se tha t Ih a
d on m y bicycle. That's all I had.She showedm e into theattic.And I 
went to sleep there.
 
 
A couple of hours later, all of a sudden there's a knock at m y door. I opened the door. 
And there are two policem en standing there.T hey said, "
M ad em
o ise lle
, you are suspicious 
and we have to take you to the police station." T hey sort of  grabbed m e oneach side of my 
arm s and walkedm e across this cobblestonesquare to thepolice station. And that's whenI 

startedto cry. Because I thoughtnow theendis here.
 
B u t t
hey cam eto the police stationand 
thepolice chief  tookone lookatm eand said let her go. So they hadbeen over eager.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So you weren't actually in this town for very long before you were able 
to reunite with your m other.
 
>> Ma rg i t  Me
issn e r:  
So m y mother was able
 
--
 
at that point Francecapitulatedand therewas 
no governm ent.It was ver y chaotic. Again, lots of  chaos, lotsand lots of  chaotic situations.My 

m other had gottenthism essage.T he prisondirector said to people like m y mother, you can 

go, the war is over, we  are not af raidof  spiesanym ore, you can leave. But mostpeople 

couldn't leave because there was no transportation. This is in the sticks, in them iddle of  

nowhere. Butm other knew where I was, so she was ableto getafarm er with a hay wagon to 

takeherf rom  Gurs towhere I was. But,of  course, Ididn't know it. Iwas sitting in the garden 

sort of  wondering what should Idoand whatwould happennext. I saw som ebody f rom  way 

back waving at m e. I didn't wave back.W ho would wave at me?That person came closer and 

wa ved m oreem phatically. And I still didn't wave back. And when she cam e close, it was m y 

m om . ButI didn't recognize her because she was so thinand she was so dark. Shehad spent 

m ostof her tim e in Gurs outdoo
rs. So I didn't com e and em brace her. 
 
 
And shenever wantedto talkabouther tim e in Gurs.She never talked about itbut she 
alwa ys talked about the one thing that she hadf ound her child and that I wasn't even 

welcom ing her.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Ma rg i t  Me i s
sner:
 
That was very, ver y upsetting toher. 
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So shortly thereaf ter, Francedivides into two zones, theGerman 
occupied zoneand the Frenchadm inistered zone. How did you
 
--
 
yo u were now in charge. 
Your m other told you it was up to you.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
Yeah, because m y mother became com pletely passive. She certainly 
would not have beena passive person until then. Butthen she didn'twant to have any partof  

it. She said, 
ﬁI
f  we aregoing to get out of here, it's up to you.
ﬂ 
 
So we s
omehow
 
--
 
again, with huge coincidences and very luck y breaks, we m anaged 
to get to the non
-
occupied zone of France and came to Marseille, a port onthe Mediterranean 
f rom  which one couldget a boatto leave Europe.
 
Mother was passive.W e had nom oney
 o
r 
v
er y little m oney.W e rented a room  ina slophouse.That was the cheapest.We had a balcony 
on which we hada little cooker on which m other cooked vegetables. She cooked vegetables, 

and I tried to f ind a way out.
 
 
I was able to get a Spanish and Portuguese
 
transit visa that were going to be validf or 
a month. So we could leave but the French wouldnot give us exit perm its.
 
W hen  t he  da y of  t h e 
validit y of the visa was over, we decided to try and go tothe border and see whether we could 

leave without the permit.W hen we cam eto the border, theborder guard said, "W hyare you 

here?," " You can't leave." So I thought, well, if we don't leave today, we'll never lea ve. AndI 

toldm y story to a porter who said, " I can show you how to walk f rom  France into Spain." A
nd 

9 
 
that's what we did.W e walked up on thePyrenees, on the French side,down ontheSpanish 
side. 
 
 
He had saidtom e, this porter who showed us the way, " Don't lose your way because 
if  youdo, you'll get picked up by the Spanishpolice." And I said 
we  
won't lose our way, but we 
did.W e gotpickedupby the Spanish police
 
an
d wenttoa Spanishjail. That was a 
lif e
-
changing experiencef orm e becauseI thought I wouldnever be in jail. And Ialsohadno 
understanding of  thepopulation that was in this jail andI learnedthat the kindof  world vie w 

with which I grew up was really not a viable world vie w. So Ihadto rethink who I was andwhat 

I was becom ing. And that was the beginning of m y sort of  conversion into the kind of person 

thatI am  today.
 
>>
 Jo A n
na W asserman: 
How long did 
you 
spend in the jail? How did you get out?And what 
happened then?
 

>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, we had,again, very lucky, ver y goodf riends who helpedus getout 
of  jail.W ho helpedus get into Portugal. Andthere we were in Portugal, stuck ina way. T here 

were lots of  other central European refugee
s 
who had also lostall of their clothing so Ibecam e 
thedressmaker to therefugees.And, of course, Ihad to learnPortuguese because Ihad to go 

shopping in them arketplace. 
 
 
I had a
 
very good tim e. My m other was m y dressf inisher. I was theseam stress and 
thepatternm aker. And I really was able to supportus, whichf elt very good. AndI hada great 

tim e because a Portuguese young wom an of a good fam ily was not perm itted to be on the
 

streets by herself  but I was not a Portuguesegirl so I was in the streets by m yself and I got 

accosted by many, m any young m en.And if Ididn't liketheir looks, Isaid
,  ﬁI
 
don't speak 
Portuguese.
ﬂ 
But if  I liked them , then they becam ef riends of m ine. So I hada very good time.
 
 
Andduring that tim e, very unexpectedly we got an Am erican imm igration visa. After 
about eightm onths in Portugal, where therewere no ship tickets because it was war and there 

were sub
m
arines in the Atlantic ocean.W e got aPortuguese corkf reighter that carried cork 
wine bottles into the UnitedStates, so threeweeks on the Atlanticocean. I was sea sickm ost 

of  the tim e, sort of halfdying of  sea sickness.But if I wasn't dying, I played ping
-
pong with the 
crew. So I became a very good ping
-
pong player. And I learned a lot of  Portuguese.
 
W e 
arrived in the Chesapeake Bay alm ost totheday three years after I lef t my home inPrague. 

So you saw thepicture of m e when we arrived here. I was 19.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So you cam eto theUnited States. You settled here. You lived here 
for afew years. T hen you actually returned toEurope after the war. You were invol ved in
 
a 
l i t t l e  b i t  of  t he  N ur em be r g w
a r 
c
rim e trials. You worked f or the U.S.Arm y of Occupation.Tell us 
about that exp
erienceof  going back.
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So I hadm arried a G.I. When he was dem obilized, he want
ed
 
t o go  ba c k  
to Europe to work. Hegot a job in the 
N u remb e rg 
war crim e trials wi th the Am erican judge.
 
So I very reluctantly went to Germ any with hi m  because Ifelt very conf licted about anything 

Germ an because Ithought there butfor the grace of God was I. I could have been ina sim ilar 

situation.
 
 
So I was working at the court. I gota job with theAmericanArm y of Occupation. And 
m y job was to re
-
educate
 
theGerman children. And when I cam e, Iwas in an Arm y off ice.T he 
soldiers who had the job beforeplayed basketball with the Germ an children and gave them 

cokes. AndI thoughtthat was no re
-
education. And I started a serious re
-
education program  
which t
urned out to be highly unsuccessf ul. Because these children were li ving under terrible 
conditions.T here was nofood.T hey lived inhalf  bombed out buildings. T he situation was dire. 

10
 
 
It was all brand new. And the last thing they were interested in was dem o
crat ic wa ys o f 
learning. But I learned a lotbecauseI really thenunderstood thedifferencebetween growi ng 

up inafascist country as opposed to growing up in adem ocratic country. So it was a very 

interesting experience for me thatalso contributed tomy own developm ent.
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
So there's a lotm ore I would like to ask you but at thispoint I'm going 
to turn to ouraudience and give you all anopportunity toask Margit questions.
 
If  you have a 
question, raise your hand andask the question.
 
I'll repeatthe question so everyone canhear it. 
T hen Margit will respond.
 
 
Any questions? 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>>
 
T he question is, 
W
hen you were youngerand yourm other sent you Paris, atthat time 
where were your othersiblings?W hat happened to th
em? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
That's a good question. Eachone of us hadtof ind asylum  someplace in 
the world that did not want to give asylum  toanybody. Som y oldest brother happened to have 

been in India working for a Czechf irm  whenthe Nazis occupied Czec
hoslovakia. Because he 
was Jewish he losthis job imm ediately. And there he was in India,penniless, but hef ound 

refuge in Australia.So he becam eanAustralian. Andas a result, I have a big Australian 

f a m ily.
 
 
And m y brother
,  
Bruno, who was in Prague wi
th m y m other
 
and whohad said tom y 
m other don't send her to Paris, let herf inishhigh school, nothing wil l  happen to her in 

Czechoslovakia,
 
m y brotherBruno changed his m ind when the Germ ans entered and he 
eventually wound up in Canada because Canada was
 
willin g to letfarmers imm igrate if they 
were will ing to becom e farmers.T hey gave him
 
$1,000 with which he bought af oodfarm  in the 
Niagara Peninsula, and he became a Canadianf ruitfarmer.
 
 
Andm y third brother was in the American Arm y andeventually s
ettled in Spain.
 
 
So we have aSpanishfam ily, a Canadianfamily, an Australianfam ily, and an 
Am ericanf am ily. I think that this isa great achievem entf or Jews who the Nazis were going to 

exterm inate that we som ehow survi ved and became viable people in d
iff e ren t parts of the 

world 
 
>> [Question Inaudible]
 
>>
 
JoAnna W asserman: 
W hen the police cam eand you thought itwas the end, what was it 
--
what thought or idea or thing did youholdonto that kept you going? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
I  so r t  of  r em em b e r m om en
ts when Ithought really the world had com eto 
an endbut som ehow I had some kind off eeling that we were going tom ake it. Idon't know 

where I had thisfeeling f rom .
 
 
Af ter a while, af ter I had takena number of
 
--
 
what is the word
 
--
 
tried to do diff ere
n t 
things, I thought that Iwould be able tom anage. I think that Ibecame
 
--
 
I ca n 't th in k of th e 
word now.W hen youtake risks. Ibecame a risk taker. See, I couldn't think of the word risk 

because I have a very old brain, you mustunderstand.
 
>>
 
[Laught
e r]  
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
So I took risks. Andafter I took afew risks and they turned out well, like 
thebom bing thatdidn't hit the station when Iwas supposed to go to thebomb shelter, then I 

thought, well, if  I can just take onem ore risk. 
 
 
And I have rem aineda risk takerf or the rest of m y lif e. I've takenm any risks.W hen I 
f irst came to the United States, I hadall kinds of  jobs that I didn't know how to do. I thought, 

well, I'll learn. So I learned. I tooka risk. And I becam e goodat it. And as ithappened, when I 

11
 
 
was reall y good at it, we moved. So Ihad many differentopportunities todo this. AndI 
continued to be a risk taker.
 
 
T here's one thing that I would like to tell m y audience. Don't be af raid of failure. 
Because af ailure isnot a big deal. People don't try things becausethey are af raid they are not 

going to be successful and then they are going to have to deal with thefact thatthey area 

failure.T here's nothing wrong with f ailing because you learn something and you pick yourself 

up
 
and youdo something different. So it'sm uch better to try andfailthan not to try at all. 
 
 
And theother thing that I would like to leave you with is the idea thatI became a 
lif elong learner.Of  course, you understand thatm y high school education stopped when I was 

in the m iddleof  10th grade, so that'sbasically all thef orm al education I had. And Ialways f elt 

thatI was ver y under educated. SoI had tomake upfor this at any opportunity thatI had.I 

alwa ys started taking classes. So I really sort
 
of  putm yself  throughhigh school onm y terms 
because I didn't have to take classes that others wantedm eto take. I only learned what I was 

interested in. And Im ust beone of the very f ew people who has a Master's degree and who 

doesn't have a high school diplom aanddoesn't have an undergraduate degree. 
 
 
But I have a Master's degree in educationbecausem y real career, after the 
dressmaking was over
 
--
 
and that was a lot wi th dressm aking. For awhile I had a dressfactory 
in San Francisco. But I was not really interested indoing this. It wasjust a challenge.But my 

real career was in the local Montgom ery County, Maryland, school system where I workedfor 

20 years on the integration of handicapped children into the generalschoolprogram . AndIdid 

not
 
know how to dothis but m y superintendent thoughtthat I coulddo anything if I putm y head 
to  it. 
 
 
So he oneday
 
--
 
therewas a public law which required the integration of handicapped 
children into the general program .And he, out of f rustration, cam e to me and said, " Margit,you 

do it."  I said," Do what?,"he said,"T his is what the school system has todo.T he school 

system  hasto im plem ent thispublic law and Iwant you to be in charge of  it."
 
S o I  c am e h om e  
and said tom y husband, "They asked me to do this. I can'tpossibly do it."  He said," Just do it." 

So Ihad todo it. 
 
 
I'm  happy to tell you that I was really ver y suc cessf ul because I knew that I needed 
allies and then I had the law on m y side. Andthere were anum ber of people in the school 

system  who understood that this law was real ly a good law. And with thehelp of m any allies 

we m anaged, I think,a ver y good specialeducationprogram .
 
 
And whenthat was over
,  
there was a transition initiative thatthefederal governm ent 
created which m eantthe transitionof handicapped students, special education students,to the 

world of  work. I wanted to work on that. My boss said," You don'thave enough work
,  
Ma rgi t ? "  
And I said, " Yes, I have enough work but it's im portantf or Montgomery County to dothis." And 

he said, "I don'tthink so."Butthen I wentover his head to the big superintendentand he 

understood that it was im portantand he said" Let's do it."
 
I wanted to get a grant to dothis. 
Andhe said," Even if we don't get the grant,we wil l do it." 
 
 
And we didn't get the grant and we did it. Ihelped create an organization 30 years ago 
which really helped employ people with disabilities. And the organization helped em ployers 

understand
 
how to hire people with disabilities and help school system s prepare studentsf or 
work. So that is what I am  proudestof  inm y life, thatI accomplished, 30 years ago.
 
And just 
this last Sunday I retiredf rom  there. I tho
ught 30 years.

[Applause]

Thank you very m uch.

JoAnna W asserman: 
In am inute I'll turn back to Margit to closethe program
 a
s you can 
now share m y appreciationfor her brillianceandfascinating character.
 
I want to thankallof  
you for being herefor our program and hopethat you'll com e back.W ehave
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
ever yW ednesday andT hursday until them iddle of August.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
that our First Personhasthe last word. Before we turn 
back to you, I want
 
to just say that anyone who had a questionf or Margit, who didn't get a 
chance to ask that question, Margit will stand up on the stage and answer questions 
af terwards. And Joel, our photographer, is going to take a photo. Soaf ter Margit speaks, if you 

co
uld just kindof  stay where you are.W e'regoing to take a photograph so that she can 
capture thism om ent with all of you in the audience.
 
 
Ma rgi t ?
 
>> Margit Meissner:
 
W ell, I already told you lots of  things. I told you to take risks and to be 
permanent le
arners.
 
I think the last thing thatI want to say is don'tbe bystanders becauseI 
think what eachone of us does really m atters. And if  you see in your own world people who 

are being bullied, where there is prejudice, where thereare conf lict thatare being solved 

violently, don't just stand there.See whetheryou can help.Be involved in your comm unity so 

that you know what goes on and that you can bea leader inbringing comm unities together 

andm aking sure that you don't stand by when you see hatredor bigotry around. Because it's 

up to eachoneof us to help our comm unities. So itm eansthat you have to be active, that you 

can't just say, well, it's none of m y business and I goplay ball or I go
 
--
 
I don't know, I go read 
m y book. You can read your book
 
and go play ball and at the sametim e rem ain aware of what 
goes on in your community andbethere tobe aforcefor healing andf or making sure that the 

humanity which is withi n all of us isappreciated. Because eachone of  us is an important 

human being.
 
So whatyou do really m atters.
