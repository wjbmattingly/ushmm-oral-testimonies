W e're set, Henry.
  
 
T hank you, Henry, for joining us andfor being wil ling to be ourf irst person afterhaving 
done this with useach year for18 years.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Unbelievable.
 
That's right.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you have som uch to share with us and we havea little tim e, just an hour.
 
W e'll start right away.
 
 
Henry, you were 11 years old when Germany invaded Poland inSeptem ber
 
1939.
 
Bef ore we turn to thewar and the Holocaust, f irsttell usa littlebit about your fam ily and 
you 

and your comm unity bef ore the war.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W ell, we were Orthodox.
 
W e lived near the synagogue, aboutf ive 
houses away f rom it.
 
I think m y f ather was
 
--
 
he openedand closedthe synagogue because he 
wa s so  clo se  t o it .
 
And we were Orthodox,
 Jewish .  
And I was the youngest of the nine.
 
I we n t 
to public school.
 
I went to Hebrew school.
 
Ihad chores aroundthe house.
 
But I never gave  up 

3 
 
soccer playing with the other kids.
 
W e 
always  had soccer gam es, alwa ys, and other things that 
people were playing, play gam es children would play.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, by the time the war began, several of  your brotherand sisters had 
already lef t.
 
W here had they gone?
 
W here had your brother and sisters gone?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Zachery was m y brother.
 
H e  wa
s 10 years older than I was.
 
He went to 
the Polish Arm y.
 
He was draf ted, I think.
 
W hether he enlisted, I don't know, but he served three 
years.
 
Andduring thewar, he was f ighting the Nazi soldiers.
 
They som ehow wound up being 
in Lithuania.
 
And then the otherbrother, m y mom  left andm yf ather passedaway t wo m onths 
bef ore the war.
 
My m om  was ver y protective.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Passed away in the summ er.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
She was very pro tective.
 
She got the neighbors, by horseand 
b u ggy
 
--
 
you know, we  didn'thave cars orm otorcycles.
 
T he horse and buggy was thepopular 
ride, horse and buggy.
 
She tookus to afarmer that they knew.
 
He either was a client or he 
brought in some stuff we would buy f rom them ,eggs, whatever, they would bring on
 
T hursday, 
andonce beforethe Sabbath would come in, they would bring goodies
 
in .
 
 
Anyway, that manhoused us f or threedays.
 
And who went there?
 
Not m y married 
sist e rs.  
My m om , m y older brother, David, Zachery was already f ighting the war with Germ any.
 
T
hem arried sistersdidn't live close tous.
 
They li ved in theoutskirts of  the town.
 
So where they 
were I don't remember.
 
I don't rem ember thehusbands
. 
 
 A
nyway
, a
ll I know is thatone ofthe sisters that you saw, Faige, she gave up that little 
gi r l  t o  go
 
with grandm a becauseher husbandwas already in Am erica.
 
He came bef orethe 
wa r .
 
He was supposed to set up shop,business.
 
Therehe was am eatm an, in Poland, a meat 
m an selling m eat to the PolishArm y.
 
But when he cam e here
 
--
 
and I happened tom eet him 
af ter the war.
 
He bought him self a shoe factory in Brooklyn, ladies shoes.
 
Can you im agine 
that ho
w happy m y sister would have been
? 
She would have changed shoes every hour.
 
Ladies shoes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, I think you alsohada sister who had come to
 
the United States.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
T hat's how I got here.
 
My sister came here in 1937.
 
A n d  m y 
father's two brothers and a sister settled in New York, one settled here inW ashington.
 
Between thesef am ilies, threef am ilies, they were only able to getonly one girl down here 
because the im m igration laws were ver y tough.
 
You just could not go
 
--
 
every tim e you we nt to 
W arsaw, to the 
consul
, they saidnext year, next year.
 
And then 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And then it was too late.
 
>> Henry Greenbau
m:
 
And m y oldest brother tried.
 
Next year, next year.
 
So  m y siste r leftf irst.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, your f atherdied in thesumm er of 1939.
 
Septem ber
 
1, Germ any 
invaded Poland.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout what happened to you and yourf am ily i n thatf irst periodof  time 
af ter Germ ans came.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
In a short while they m arked us all with the yellow Star of David, one in 
the f ront and in the back.
 
W ehad to wear that.
 
To be honest with you, we were dressed like 
Je ws e
xcept for the black pants.
 
W e didn't have the beard.
 
W edef initely had the tassels 
st ickin g o u t .
 
Never bareheaded.
 
T hey still insisted you wear the yellow star.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Onthe f rontand the back?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
On the back, yes.
 
F r om  a b ab y o n
 
up to whatever age it is.
 
So if  you 
happened to walk on the sidewalk, f ace
-
to
-
f ace with a soldier,the order was f or you to step off 

4 
 
the sidewalk, take your hat off , stay attentionuntil the soldier walks through.
 
W henever he 
walks through, you can go backon the sidewalk.
 
 
If I we n t to  see m y siste r
 
--
 
she lived somewhere else.
 
T hey alsohad a tailor shop in 
the outskirts.
 
I musthave gotten off the sidewalk aboutfour,f ive times.
 
Every f ive m inutes, 
another soldier, another soldier.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A nd  
you had to step off into the road.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
If you didn't
 
--
 
I saw one guy get beatup.
 
He  wa s kicke d  of f .  A
nd those 
boots, I will guarantee you, doesn't 
t ick le
 
when they hit you onthe ribs or hit you with their rif le 
b u tt.
 
Off  you go on the st
reet.
 
Soonce we saw that, you obeyed it so we wouldn't get hurt.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, tell us about soonaf ter the invasion you were with your b
rother and you 
ca m e a cro ss
 
what youcalled a ragged groupof  Polish soldiers.
 
I think you were with your 
brot
her David.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W edid nothave a whole bunch of soldiers.
 
Only one soldier.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One soldier.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T hef arm er gave us apiece of  breadand butter.
 
He says, Go get 
yourself  a tom ato off the vine.
 
W hatdo you call 
them?
 
Clusters of tom atoes, those big ones.
 
W e took a tomato off  and we were eating.
 
David was supposed to get a glassof m ilk.
 
 
In them eantim e we saw somebody approaching us, a singlem an ina uniform, 
dragging along a bike, brokenbike.
 
A s he  go t clo se
 
enough,m y brother happened to know 
h im .
 
He knew m y brother.
 
W hether he was acustom er inthe tailor shop, that Idon't know, or 
either he went to school with the guy.
 
He som ehow knew him .
 
T hey called eachother by first 
name.
 
H e  s a ys
,  ﬁW
here are you running away f rom?
ﬂ 
He  s a id
,  ﬁ
I'm runningf rom  the German 
A rm y
. 
I justescapedf rom them and I'm running in the wrong direction.
ﬂ 
T he opposite direction 
he was running.
 
 
My brother, Dave, out of  nowhere, I couldnot believe what I heard,he says, "Ok if  I go 
a
long with you?"
 
He says, " Of course, you're m y f riend."
 
He was not Jewish but they knew 
each other either f rom  a customer standpoint or school.
 
T he guy says, yeah, com e along.
 
I 
didn't like whatI heard.
 
I  sa ys,  
ﬁY
ou're going to leave me with the three sistersand mom to 
protect me?
ﬂ 
I thoughtthebig brother was supposed to protect you.
 
T he older brother.
 
And so 
happenedhe ran away with that soldier, Polish soldier.
 
If ollowed them for a couple of m iles, 
hiding behind bushes.
 
Af ter I lif tedm y head,he turned aroundto see if  I'm f ollowing, " Goback 
to your mother," " Goback to yourm other."
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you did. 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Andeventually thePolish soldier yelled atm e, " Go backto yourm other.
 
You're too young to go with us."
 
I left th em
 
alone.
 
Thenext time I saw them  was in Am erica.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And we'll talk about that later.
 
 
Henry, it wasn't long after the Germ an invasion that you andthef am ily and the other 
Jews in town were forced into a ghetto.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W e ll ,  if 
youdid not live near the synagogue,that was part of the ghetto.
 
T hey took three short little blocks, very short, not long blocks.
 
And the intersections were 
blocked off.
 
W hoever lived behind that had tom ove into that order.
 
6,000 I think were there at 
t
he tim e.
 
T hey all had to move in where we were, near the synagogue.
 
And they f orm ed what 
they called the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
6,000of  you moved into a coupleof  blocks.
 

5 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T hree blocks.
 
And we had to put up two sisters and their 
children, so 
we had no room .
 
W ehad the tailor shop in thef ront.
 
But even if they were not related to you, 
you still were able to save them , give them som ewhere to sleep, safe.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, if  I remember right, just before you were forced into the ghetto, you and 
your sisters went to work in anamm unitionf actory.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
Bef ore the ghettostarted we already had jobs inthe am munition 
fa cto ry.
 
It was Faige, Ita, and Hia.
 
They had jobs inthef actory, including m e.
 
A nd  m y f at h er 
a
rranged thatbefore he passedaway.
 
One of our custom ers happened to be either am anager 
or hehad som ething to do, some big wheel inthefactory.
 
And m yf ather approached him.
 
He  
heardthe rumors that that's what the Nazis liked, tailor shop, shoe shop, 
c
arpenter, they don't 
care about that.
 
But ifyou worked in af actory, especially a m unitionf actory, they loved that 
because you helped along with the war m achinery.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you're in therem aking bullets at age 11.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W e we r e p
roducing antiaircraf t shells,heavy duty springs, m elting down 
scrap metal, and shavi ng out thebarrelsf rom thetanks.
 
S o lit t le  s link ie s .
 
A nd  s om e p eo p l e 
had to do this job.
 
Every week they m ade you change your job.
 
Alsothe hours changed
f
r om  
7:00
 
to 3:
00 ,  f r om  3 : 00
 
to 11:00, and f rom  11:00
 
to 7:00
 
in the m orning.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Once you were in the ghetto,did you continue worki ng in the am munition 
fa cto ry?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
But then thefactory nam e was
 
--
 
bef orewas called, in Polish, 
[Speakin
g N o n
-
English Language] but then whenthe Germ ans invadedus, itbecame Henry 
[Indiscernible] workers, his nam e on it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
During thattim e, you ended up living in the ghettof or alm ost three years.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Alm ost two years in the g
hetto.
 
And then they decided to have a 
selection.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou tell us about this, tell us more about the conditions in the ghettofor 
you.
 
How were you able to get food?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Food was scarce.
 
W ecould not get any f ood.
 
W e r an  
ou t  of  f oo d.
 
And 
all the stores were looted on theoutside.
 
T here was no f ood around.
 
The only wa y you could 
get extra food would be if  you bribed a soldier.
 
Now, you couldn't bribe the Germans butthe 
Ukrainians, if  you gave them a watch, abracelet, a necklace,he would bring you some bread.
 
But it so happened that they changed so often, every tim e two weeks are up, a new one 

com ing in.
 
And you only have so m uch to bribe away.
 
You're not going to give ever ything 
away.
 
So they were bri bing and then it st
opped.
 
 
T hey would bring in once a week, rations.
 
Tha t wa s it.
 
W e were dirty, f ilthy.
 
They 
wouldn't give us any soap to wash,no laundry washing, not yourself to take a shower even.
 
W e we ref ilt h y d irt y.
 
For three years we didn't wash.
 
You wore the sam e cl
othes f or three 
years.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For three years.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T he sam e clothes thatyou wore when they invaded ourtown, you wore 
the same clothes.
 
In the sum mer time, the man could undressf rom the waste up.
 
T hey used to 
take the dirt f rom  t
he groundand put itall over you, like am ud bath.
 
And thenext would pum p 
the water and clean you off a little bit.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W it h  dir t .
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
It cam eoff , eventually, you know, themud cam e off.
 

6 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You would stay in
 
those conditions in the ghettountil 1942,alm ost three years.
 
W hat happened to you then?
 
W hen did 
you 
leave the ghetto?
 
T ell us about leaving the ghetto.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Oh, leaving the ghetto.
 
There was a selection.
 
The order was 24 hours 
where no one could go to work at all.
 
Soeverybody was under one roof , so to speak.
 
They got 
extra soldiers, extra guards, extra dogs, and they putus
 
--
 
they chased us out of the ghetto 
area to a open f ield.
 
There was three orfoursoldiers directing traff ic.
  
 
I 'l
l gi ve you an exam ple, m y f am ily walked up, so I walkedup, m y mom  walkedup, my 
two m arried sisters walked up,m y grandm a had the little baby f rom Faige, also walked up 
there.
 
And right away t hat we showed our IDcards that we worked in thef actory, we went over 
to one side.
 
Andthen if you didn't have an ID,you were unattached,you didn'thave any f am ily 
or children,they'd push you over with us, the working people
, a
b le
-
bodied people, whether a 
m an or wom an, they saved all of those.
 
And they took away s
om e people away f rom us.
 
W e 
didn't know where they were taking them , handicapped,pregnant wom en, women with 

children,elderly people, grandm as, grandpas, they took them away.
 
W e lookedfor them af ter 
the war but we were told not tobother looking for them
 
because they were m urdered two days 
af ter that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
T wo days af ter that.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Af ter we were separated in a place calledT reblinka, killing center.
 
T h e y 
got off  thetrain, were ordered to a shower.
 
Instead of  water, youhadthe g
a s  k illin g t h em .
 
They 
were crem ated, too.T reblinka, nothing but a
 
k illin g c e n t e r.
 
They got off  thetrain, were ordered 
to  ta ke
 
a shower.
 
Instead of water, you had the gas killing them.
 
T hey were crem ated, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that's what happened to your m other?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
My m om ,m y two m arried sisters,three little nieces,and two nephews.
 
I 
don'tthinkthey were even 7, 8 years old.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thenwhat happened to you
, f
or thoseof  you whowere selected? 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T hey took them  away from us.
 
W e heard yellings going on, on the way 
to the train station.
 
There was either shootingin the air.
 
W e couldnot see.
 
Eventually they 
walked awa y.
 
W e c ou ld  n ot  s ee .
 
W e couldonly hear the noise, scream sa lotof  scream s and a 
lot of  shouts we heard
. W
hether they were shoot in the air or killing people we don't know.
 
T hen they turned around to us, the able
-
bodied people, thepeople thathave ID cards, turned 
around to them, and also the people who they saved that was not with ID, they did
 
other 
th
ings, maybe shoemakers, m aybe carpenters, m aybebakers, who knows, butthe 
able
-
bodied looking people that were able towork so they saved them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Im ight add, I thinkat this point you're 14 years of age.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
I 'm  
already close to
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Close to 14.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
So what happened, they chased usback to theplacebut they 
didn't let us goback into the ghetto area.
 
If you lef tanything, valuables, in the ghetto, stayed in 
the ghetto.
 
You couldnot retrieve anything.
 
They chased usfor six kilom eters uphill.
 
B y t h e  
tim e we got to the stone quarry on the top ofa hill, it was overlooking the town, the whole 

ca m p 
--
 
the whole stone quarry was overlooki ng the town.
  
 
T hey builtf orus barracks and
 
it was a slave labor camp.
 
T he barracks were on stilts.
 
T here was 100 toa barrack.
 
T here were three toa shelf , threemenor three wom en, separate 
f rom  the m en.
 
The shelf  was just like thef loor.
 
It was not a rug on there.
 
T here was notpadded 
with any stra w or hay or anything
, j
ust plain wood.
 
And we slept in our clothes, dirty,f ilthy, 
already two years old.
 

7 
 
 
And then what happened, we all got on the top of the stone quarry.
 
T he loudspeaker 
cam e on
, a
ttention, attention, you m ustempty all your pockets,
 
all your belongings.
 
So  
yo u  
didn'tbring away anything
. If
 
you had stuff  with you, som emoney, som e people did, som e 
braceletsor gold chains, whatever they had, they hadto throw theminto a box.
 
W e were 
threatened if  youdon't put them  inthis box and you com e through this gate and we searchyou 
and wef ind things on you, you will be killed on the spot.
 
So everybody was scared.
 
They took 
ever ything out, whatever they had that they didn't bribe away, they threw it in there.
 
 
T hen there was oneatthe gate and oneat the barrack.
 
They were givin g each other 
s ign a ls .
 
If  the barrackwas f ull, they went over to another barrack
 a
nd another barrack.
 
A nd 
they did the same with the wom en.
 
 
W e stayed there.
 
And thenthe only thing they did is when
 
we got tothe slave labor 
c a m p,
 
they form ed a tailor shop.
 
Over 100 tailors working on the Germ an uniform s.
 
A 
h i gh
-
ranking off icer cam e into thetailor shop.
 
He  sa ys,  Y
ou got afew m onths to do this 
operation,new stuff , and youm usthave it by that time and we will l et you know a little before 

that when the selection or when the deportation will start again.
 
 
T hatm an cam e in.
 
Bythattim e we were all si ck already.
 
W e t oo k  i t o ve r  f r om  the  
ghetto.
 
Goesf rom  thedirt and filth, we got alllice inf ested.
 
And lice breedsT y
phoid and the 
T yphoidepidem icbroke out, a very contagious sickness.
 
You sleep in such close quarters, 
three guys or three wom en together,one gets sick, you are sure the others are going to get 

sick,  t o o .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Absolutely no medical care.
 
>> H e
nry Greenbaum :
 
No .
 
No m edical care.
 
The only thing saved us, if youhad ahighf ever, 
done right there.
 
If you had low f ever, you couldf ake it to go to work.
 
You were a little dizzy.
 
I 
hada low fever and Faige, theone that gave up the little girl, she had low fever.
 
So the two of  
u s.  
But she was workin g in the tailor shop already
, F
aige.
 
Theother two were still in the 
amm unition factory.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And where were you working at thattim e?
 
W here did they m ake you work? 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
I was in thefactory, stil l producing theantiaircraft shells.
 
Yu p .  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hileyou were there atthatslave labor cam p, youwere invol ved in an escape 
a ttem p t.
 
W ill you tell us about that? 
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W hat?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
An escape attempt.
 
>>
 
Henry Greenbaum :
 
Oh , ye s.
 
T h e h i gh
-
ranking off icer walked in the tailor shopand said in 
two weeks you m ust have all of  this stuff ready because all of you are going to be deported.
 
S o 
the tailors didn't like what they heard and they organi zed anescape among them selves, 

including m y sister was there.
 
T hey were af raid to tell everybody.
 
It's im possible a whole cam p 
should disappear.
 
Some people can get out ifthey plan it right.
 
 
Som y sister, Faige, told me about the escape only theday bef ore, one 
af t e r no o n 
b ef o r e.
 
My shif t was f rom 3:00
 
t o 1 1: 0 0.
 
W hen I getback tomorrow at 11:00, be ready, we are 
going to escape.
 
 
I was already 15 years old at that tim e.
 
W e were going to escape.
 
I  lik e d  it .
 
I heard to 
get outof  this hell place.
 
I was a really happy young man.
 
I was thinking, God, it's abouttime 
we do something to get out.
 
 
And these tailors were spreading thenews am ong only theirf riends or relatives.
 
S o  i t 
was m ore than just the tailors.
 
And we linedup.
 
My sist e r ca m e b y.
 
She 
wa s
 
with a Jewish
 
policeman at night, at 11:00.
 
At  11 : 00
 
I go t off  f ro m the  f a cto ry.
 
I cam ebackand she says, 

8 
 
"W hen you com e tomorrow, do not go into the barrack.
 
W ait for m e outside and I'm  going to 
com e and get you".
 
She cam eby close to12:00.
 
I don't know, didn'thave
 
any watches, butwe 
approxim ately knew what tim ethey letus out of  thefactory. 
 
 
T hen she was holding the Jewish policem anby his hand.
 
She grabbedm y hand.
 
A ll 
three were running.
 
And they set it up sothere was 10 ina group, 10 in a line.
 
And only 10
 
can 
approach the hole.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Therewas a hole cut in the fence.
 
Righ t ?  
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T he hole hadbeen cutin the wire f ence andalso a woodenf enceon 
the outside.
 
T hey cut the wire f ence, didn'tmake any noise.
 
The third party of 10arr
ived.
 
Three 
tim es 10 got there.
 
And they cut the hole open bigger.
  
 
And then they startedfooling around with thewoodenf enc
e . B
reaking wood causes 
noise m aking.
 
Andthat caused the Germ an Shepherddogs tobarkand growl andm ade 
attention tothe guards up in the tower.
 
They put thef lood lights on,on the tower, and they saw 
people were running towards the escape route.
 
Of  coursethey were shooting at them .
 
There 
we r e  t wo  of  t hem .
 
Andthe search light was on them .
 
Quiteafew were still waiting in line.
 
I  wa s  
wa it in g.
 
I was supposed tobeafter the thirdto go.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you hadn't hada chance to run to thefence yet.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
No .
 
I stayed in the group waiting f orm y next.
 
 
So whenever they stopped with thef lood lights, people st
arted 
running out.
 
Then they 
put the lightson around crazy to see if  anybody was on the camp so to speak, running.
 
W e 
were still standing in the group likea deer on the highway.
 
T he search lights, the f lood lights, 
get the deer to f reeze.
 
T hey don't know
 
which  wa y to go.
 
So we asked thepolicem an, some 
people did.
 
He  sa id
,  ﬁW
hat would you do?
ﬂ 
He says run in different directions and run towards 
your barrack.
 
He can only shoot oneat a time.
 
Only hadthe rif le.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So goback to your barracks.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
And then run back to the barracks.
 
So while doing this, we started 
running.
 
Maybe the policem an told m y sister to run towards thehole.
 
All of  a sudden they put 
thef lood lights onherandthef lood lights were shining on us.
 
They started shooting.
 
I caught a 
bullet, struck the back of m y head, grazed m e and knockedm e out.
 
I came back afew 
seconds laterand Ididn't see m y sister, Faige, or thepolicem an.
 
Ididn't see anybody around 
m e.
 
Everybody was alr eady in the places where they were going.
 
 
T hen I decided, DearLord, you have to help m e
. Y
ou lef t me all alone so I could see 
m y sister in Am erica.
 
And I lowered m y head.
 
I do remember counting 15.
 
T here was a 
purpose of this counting because the lights, the search lights, were going 
around.
 
W he n I  h i t  
15, it was on me.
 
So Ihadto count 15, bef ore 15, and run towards the wom en barracks.
 
I 
didn't want to get into my barracks.
 
I wantedto go to the wom en's barracks lookingf orm y 
sister, Faige.
 
I thoughtm aybe she changed her m ind andmade it, like the policeman said,run 
b a ck.  
Instead, he tookher.
 
Saw I got hit, andrun towards the hole.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Still tried to get out.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
S till trie d  to ge t o ut.
 
W henI got into the woman's barracks, the wom an 
knew m e by nam e.
 I  
knew her nam e, too.
 
She was m y neighbor.
 
" You can't come in here.
 
You're full of blood.
 
You're going to get us allkilled."
 ﬁ
I'm  not going to get you killed.
 
I a lm ost 
got killed m yself
, ﬂ 
I  s a id
.  ﬁN
o ,  
you can't stay here.
ﬂ 
 
So I satdown and said she's not
 
going to get m e out of  here.
 
I sat down on the 
door
way, one f oot out and one f oot in.
 
She was a little weaker than I was.
 
She couldn't push 
m e nowhere.
 
And when everybody stopped running
,  
totally running, thetwo guards were very 

9 
 
angry and random ly they picked different barracks to shoot inside.
 
Shots came into the 
wom en's barracks.
 
All the wom en were f rightened.
 
Idon't know if  anybody got killed.
 
I  do n' t  
know.
 
T hey all jum pedoff  their bunks,on theground they went.
  
 
So I was on the ground m yself .
 
So  I
 
was eye level with them .
 
And I still searching f or 
m y sister, Faige.
 
And I ran across a cousin, a f irst cousin, Ida.
 
Sh
e was not aware of the 
escape.
 
Nobody toldher about the escape.
 ﬁ
W hat are you lookingfor?
ﬂ ﬁ
I'm  looking f or m y 
sister, Faige.
ﬂ 
" She is
 
not here.
 
I know whatbunk she is."
 
W hen Iheard bunk, well, she 
probably knew.
 
T hey m usthave been corresponding together.
 
Maybe she didn't tell herabout 
the escape.
 
T hat I don't know the reason.
 
 
Anyway, she says, "W hat happenedto you?"
 
I saidI was i
njured,
 
ca n
 
you help me.
 
She tookthe water that they had inthe barrack and she took old rag and cleanedm e off in the 
b a ck.  
Blood was running down m y shirt,f uriously, like you cut openthe skin with the knife, two
-
inch.
 
Never bothered the skull, thank G
od .
 
If  that would have been a sm idge deeper, I wouldn't 
be here talking to you.
 
I would beover thereburnt up som ewhereor probably buried.
 
T h e y 
didn'thave what do you call
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
No crem atorium  where you were.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
No burning bodies, nogassing, either.
 
Hanging, yes, shooting, yes, hit 
with you the rif le over the head, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hen did 
you 
f ind out what happened to Faige?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W hen If inally decided, after she cleanedm eup a little bit, put the rags
 
on here, tookthe beret offher head and put it onm ine.
 
"W e a r
 
t he  ber e t .
 
Let the rag stop the 
bleeding."
 
I loweredmy head.
 
T he search light was still running around.
 
I loweredm y head.
 
M y 
place was in the opposite direction.
 
I lowered m y head and I made
 
itintom y barrack where I 
belonged.
 
 
T he next m orning, roll call.
 
W e had to line up for work.
 
So a lot of people were m issing 
in that group f rom  the barrack.
 
Andm ostly the tailors, thebiggest because som eof  them got 
out earlier.
 
I don't know.
 
Ma ybe there were 75 insteadof 100.
 
S o 25  wa s  m i s s i ng.
 
So they got 
to be som ewhere.
 
They either in the barrack, under the stilts.
 
So they lef t thedogs underneath 
thebarrack to see if  anybody was hiding there.
 
 
T henall of a sudden they took the two guards with the dogs and went inside.
 
Inside 
they found people.
 
Th ey we re  sick.
 
Some of them were not injuredbut sickf rom  theT yphoid.
 
T he y f ou nd  s om e .
 
 
So the only wa y, they either escaped,they were wounded at the hole,
 
or they 
escaped.
 
And that's whenthey told us
 
toface the area where the hole is.
 
W e l oo k e d a t t he 
holeandthere was people m oaning and groaning, wounded people.
 
Oneof  them  was the 
policeman.
 
He was onthe ground,upright position.
 
He had his cap on, his arm band on.
 
He  
was still sitting down m oaning and groaning.
 
W here he was hit, Idon't know.
 
I didn't seeany 
blood.
 
 
As soon asthey shot all the woundedpeople inf ront of ourfaces
 
--
 
th is  is  wh a t  wil l 
happento you shouldyou ever get an idea escaping again
, w
e  will k ill yo u
 
--
 a
nd that's when 
as soon as the policeman dropped,then I saw m y sister, with theblond hair, stretchedout by 

h is  le gs .
 
I sa id, D
earLord, now I'm  all alone.
 
You have todouble watch me now so I canmake 
it to Am ericato seem y sister.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Andnow you are com pletely aloneat this point.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Ye s .
 
I was all alone.
 
The earlier ones, Ididn't know if  they killed them  
yet, till after the war, whenthey took them toT reblinka. 
 

10
 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
There's so muchmore to tellus and we're running out 
of time .
 
From  there you 
would be taken to Auschwit z.
 
T ell usabout going to Auschwitz.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T he date cam eby when all the unif orm s were ready, the magic day 
cam e by.
 
They chased us towards the railroad station.
 
The whole slave labor cam p was
 
em ptied out.
 
W e all got on those cattle cars.
 
Must have put at least 100 people intoa train.
 
And no water, no bathroom
,  
no water orf oodat all, just stuck us in and lo
c
ked itf rom the 
outside.
 
And whenall the cars weref ull, women andm en, we all went on a journey.
 
W e didn't 
know where they were taking us.
 
T hey wouldn't tell us.
 
W e were riding, ever y stop we stopped, 
in unison we were scream ing
,  
"W ate r, wa te r."
 
W e didn't ask for f ood.
 
W e didn't ask for 
bathroom s.
 
W e just screamedfor water.
 
T he thirst is the worst whenyou're thirsty.
 
T hey did 
not give us any water.
 
 
I remember watching the f ilm, whatever, hose, a water hose came in through that little 
windo w but they didn'tdo thattous.
 
W e scream ed indiff erent languages, in unison, "W ater!
 
W a te r !"
 
Lo
ud  
and clear.
 
They couldhear usfar awa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A nd  no wa t e r .
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
No water was gi ven
 
to
 u s.  
W ef inally arri ved at our destination.
 
It was 
A u sch wit z-
Bi rkenau.
 
They opened the cars f rom  the outside and we got off.
 
And right away 
an
other selection, left, right, lef t, right.
 
W e all looked alike.
 
W e a ll f e lt a lik e .
 
W e a ll 
ha
d t he  
s a m e s t r e n gt h.
 
 
I thinkthey had an order
 
--
 
they hadto know how m any they needed todispose of that 
day.
 
I don't think they had
 
--
 
som e people said maybe they didn't have any room .
 
I didn't care.
 
T hey could sleepon top of each other, they don't care.
 
But I thinkthey had an order how many 
to kill that nightand halfof our transport wentstraight to crem atorium.
 
They went straight t
o the 
gas chamber.
 
 
How did we know that?
 
W e asked theelderly people,the elderpeople that were there 
bef ore us.
 
W hatdid they do with people when they were separated?
 
T hey saidalready the 
sm o ke st a cks.  
You see theashesf lying around.
 
I t  wa s f r om  th em .
 
He says " You were pretty 
lu cky. "  
W h y wa s  I  l u cky?
 
Because they hadm eon theopposite side.
 
 
My f irst stop was ahaircut.
 
T he barber was Jewish.
 
So we conversed in Jewish.
 
He  
askedm e what the wound was on top of m yhead.
 
It didnot heal up yet.
 
I d idn 't 
have any 
bandages on.
 
Everything was off .
 
But there was still
 
--
 
I had a scab
, 
underneath was inf ected.
 
 
So the next one was the tattooing thenum ber.
 
My num ber onthe arm ,on the left arm , 
A18991.
 
And Ibelievethey got the inmates
 
--
 
they taughtthe inmates how to do that, in 
Auschwitz, how to do tattooing, because they didn't wantto touch you.
 
So this way the inmates 
d id  it .
 
 
T henm y third one was a shower.
 
Andm ind you, we didn't clean upfor three years, 
the same clothes
. W
ewe re  d irt y f ilt h y,  s t ill 
wit h lice, still atouch of thatT yphoid.
 
Because if you 
hadhighf ever, you never m ade it toAuschwitz anym ore.
 
Because the
 
Einsatzgruppen
,  
k illin g 
unit
,  
would come.
 
If you didn't lineupfor work, you were on the bunk, they would put you on 
the trucks and if  thetruck was f ull, they would take you to theoutskirts of  the town and 
there
 
--
 
we dug those trenches when we were  putthe yellow Star ofDavid
. T
hey would catch 
us in the street.
 
Even if
 
you showed them that you 
due at 3:00
 
f o r wo rk .
 
He  sa ys,  
ﬁY
o
u're not 
due till 3:00.
 
T his is 10:00
 
in the morning.
 
You go work f or us.
 
W e'll take you 
to  
the  fa cto ry.
ﬂ 
And they did.
 
Only once I pulleda double shift.
 
T hat's all I did, one tim e only.
 

11
 
 
 
So the holes were made.
 
T hey told us
 
this isfor m ilitary tanks to 
f a ll in .
 
Zigzag shape.
 
But they used those graves for graves, f or the people they had undress inf ront of them , 
undress inf ront of the ditch,and they were s hot in the back of the head and in they went.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So Henry, f or you at Auschwi tz, you were selectedfor slave labor, to continue 
doing more slave labor.
 
W hat were youf orced to do once you were selectedf or labor at 
A u sch wit z?  

>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
You m ean, the Germ an man, a civilian, came into Auschwitz
-
Bi rkenau 
looking f or f ree labor, cam e
 
in with two dogs and two guards.
 
He chased us out of our barrack 
in the f ront of  him.
 
He looked you over
, w
hether he liked you
. T
hoseID cards did not help you 
in Auschwitz.
 
He looked at yourfaceand how you look.
 
If you were notundernourishedor 
could 
s t i l l  do  s om e wo r k .
 
A n d it wa s lef t, righ t, lef t, righ t.
 
Andthat's whenthey killed half  ofm y 
transport.
 
 
And then thatm an took 50 of us out of there.
 
He m archedusfor three kilometers 
u p h ill.
 
Ithought it was uphill, towards Buna
-
Monowitz, a subcam po
f  A u sch wit z.
 
And that man 
was either m anager orowner of a IG FarbenCom pany, producers of  cyclone gas and bug 

sprays, autom obile tires, syntheticfuel.
 
But thatm anthat picked 50 of  usfor one reason only.
 
He wanted us to builda road with the cobblestone, a roadthat thebig trucks could goonso 

they wouldn't have only the rail becausethe rail was bom barded by the American Air Force.
 
It 
was knocked out.
 
 
So they started actually, the road too late.
 
Itwas only three months.
 
You could only do 
so much with 50 people, in the wintertime, no gloves, handling stones, all kindsof  shovels.
 
T hen if they would pay you a visit, the Air Force would com e,they wouldalwa ys bom b ahead 

of  the locomotive so when the locom otive gets to that spot, they can't go nowhere.
 
 
I rememberf rom  there we went to 
--
 
what doyou call it
 
--
 
the Air Force cam e and they 
were m ore aggressive
. T
hey hada bunker on theprem ises of the IG Farben Company.
 
T h e y 
had a bunker.
 
T he bunker was not f or the Jews.
 
T hey were f or thedogs, guards, 
and 
non
-Je ws.  
Every tim e the air raid would come, they would runfor the bunker.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat would happen to you?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W ehad to work through.
 
W e couldnever stop.
 
Maybe those soldiers 
saw us in the stripesbecause by that time, in Auschwitz af terthe shower, they gave us stri pes.
 
W ehad striped jacket,pants, wooden bottom shoes, canvas socks. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were sent to Auschwit z in 1944, as you just described.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T he  en d  of  
`
44 .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Late 
`
44 .
 
Yo u
 
were put on ahard labor crew to buildthe road.
 
In January of 
1945, as the Russiansgot closers are, you weref orced outof  thereand sent on a death 

m arch.
 
Inthe time we have lef t, Henry, tell us about them arch youwere sent on and about 
your liberati
on.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W ell ,  no t  r ea l l y
 
--
 
we didn't go f rom  Auschwitz.
 
I went to Flossenburg.
 
I 
stayed there afew m onths.
 
And then we heard rum ors that the Russians were com ing to 
liberate Flossenburg.
 
W ethought maybe that's possible but thenthey changed their m ind, the 
ru m o rs .
 
It was theAmericans approaching Flossenburg.
  
 
T he Germ ans are notstupid.
 
Three days before they load us up ontrucks.
 
T hey 
wanted to hurry.
 
T hey didn't wantus 
t o 
ma rc h .
 
On truck they tookus to the rail, stuck us in the 
t ra i
n s.  
T hey only lef t10 peopleto cleanupthe area, and to hide the evidence will to behidden.
 

12
 
 
 
In Flossenburg, the only work we did, m y group that cam e, was bundling up the 
unif orm s or clothingf rom  people who they kill ed, coats, coats, pants, pants, shoe
s,  sho e s.
 
T hey would send them back to Germ any for recycling. 
 
 
Right there we were ri ding thetrains andtheAir Force started getting more 
aggressi ve.
 
T hey knocked down to pieces the IG Farben Com pany, including the bunker.
 
I 
know 
civilians were in there
 
but guards, too.
 
And they knocked out the wholef actory.
 
T hey 
even upside down theroad for threem onthswe were building.
 
Everything was upside down.
 
T hef reight cars were sitting with supplies, upside down.
 
T he wheels were on top.
 
T hey tore 
the place ap
a r t.
 
 
T hen we startedm arching after that.
 
W ecame with the train to aplace called the 
b la c k  f ie ld.
 
W e cam e there andone car wasfull of  SS guys, or Gestapo,f ull of them.
 
T he y a ll 
had rif les with them, guns, whatever.
 
W e were riding through the countryside, quietly.
 
You 
couldhear the locom otive.
 
You heard
 
--
 
why t hey didn't go to sleep is beyondm e.
 
A ll t he y 
were doing was singin g Germ an songs, loudand clear.
 
T hen we didn't know where it com e 
f r om .
 
W ethought it was a record maybe, play
 
--
 
one 
of  those things.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But itwas the SS soldiers.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T he airplanes came through thef ield.
 
T he AirForce probably knew, or 
m aybe notprobably but 100% sure.
 
Atf irst they lowered them selves, low
-
f lyin g,  a  lit t le  lo w 
f lyin g.
 
T he y
 
gi ve theseguy as a chance.
 
T hey knew it was the 
A
m erican Air Force.
 
T hey 
openedthe cars andmade us run into the woods.
 
And if any of theGerm ans soldiers went into 
the woods, they had like a tripod, like a camera sits on, laying, stretched out on the g
round, 
andfacing where we would run.
 
You couldonly run about 10
 
f eet, you had to drop.
 
10
 
feet and 
drop.
 
 
Anyway, that Air Force tore apartthe locom otive until the last car.
 
Everything was torn 
apart
 w
ith bom bs.
 
Andf rom  then on we had to m arch.
 
T he march took a tollonus becausewe 
didn't getthat piece of bread, a little black im itation coffee.
 
At nighttim ethey gave us cabbage 
water soup.
 
I had a spoontieduptom y pants, never took that spoon off.
 
T hey never gave m e 
any food that you need a spoon.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
By that tim e, Henry, where did you think they were taking you?
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W e didn't know.
 
W edidn't know where they were taking us.
 
Because 
they kept m arching.
 
And the only way that we stopped, if  the two guards were hungry and the
y 
run out of suppliesfor soldiers, the guards, they wound up on thefarm .
 
T he farm ers
,  
German.
 
T hey had them selvesa 10
-
course m eal.
 
W ho knows what they ate.
 
And us, one raw potato 
and some water todrink.
 
You were so hungry,  you couldeatf ive or 10 potatoesand it wouldn't 
be enough.
 
Only one.
 
If  you wantto sneak in the line and get another one, if  they recognize 
you, I guarantee youthat's the lastpotato you would have.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, I know we're skipping over so m uch that youcould share with us.
 
T e ll 
us how you were liberated.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
W ell, those two guards were m arching us.
 
W hen we got closeto a 
s m a ll t
own in Bavaria,the two guards let us stop.
 
It was a wooded area.
 
W e could see the 
highwa y f ull of American pieces youf ighta 
wa r  wit h .
 
W e didn't know if  they were Am ericans.
 
W efigured out the planes are because when those planes got low, you run into the woods.
 
T hey were tr ying to save us, all of a sudden they becam e kind.
 
They let us stay for liberation.
 
T hey becam e good. 
 
 
So
 
they left us right there.
 
They ran away them selves
, t
he two guards.
 
T hey lef tus by 
ourselves.
 
By thattim e it was already half  of them archers, half of the peoplethat marched, 

13
 
 
was already dead.
 
Som eof  them  died on their own.
 
Som e of  them  they couldn't 
keep up with 
them arch, they shot them or they hit them  with the rif le over the head.
 
T here was no 
crem ation, no gasoline.
 
They had tobeburied, the bodies had to be buriedthere. 
 
 
T henall of a sudden we got mad.
 
W hy did 
you 
leave usall alone here?
 
An y
body could 
com e over hereand kill us now.
 
But they ranaway.
 
W e ran into thewoods if  you see the 
plane.
 
 
T hen we saw the Arm y.
 
You could see with the nakedeye.
 
You don't need binoculars 
on thehighwa y that this American Arm y was com ing through.
 
And one 
of tho se  ta n ks too k off  
f rom  them ain roadf rom  that colum n
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Towards you.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
T hey cam e towards us.
 
W esaidfor sure they' re going to kill us now.
 
W estill thought it was Germans.
 
W edidn't know it was Am ericans.
 
And they stopped the tank.
 
Stopped aboutf ive feet away.
 
And the beautiful American soldier cam eout, crew cut, Am erica 
w r i t t e n  h e r e,  c am e out of  t he  ha t c h.
 
He was alittle skinny tofit in that hatch.
 
He had trouble 
getting up.
 
A n ywa y.
 
H e put hishands on hism outhand he said, "W e areAmericans andall of 
you are f ree."
 
I was that time 17 years old.
 
W hen I hea
rd that word "f ree," I said 
--
 
when I 
heard that f rom  the soldier
,  
say that you aref ree, I said, Dear Lord,thank youfor leading those 
soldiers tous and give us ourf reedom but why did it take you so long?
 
Five years.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
F i ve  ye a r s.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
For us to bef ree.
 
T hesam e soldier yelled to his other soldier," Em pty 
all the rations"  on the tank.
 
T he y d um p ed  t hem  ou t.
 
W e we r e  f i gh t i ng 
like anim alsof  the jungle 
t h a t  k ill an ima ls .
 
W e were alm ost killing each other.
 
 
And somebody spokea little English in m y grouptounderstand all of that.
 
He relayed 
it to us in Yiddish, in Jewish, what he wanted.
 
He toldus tof ollow him .
 
He took us ou
t  of  the  
wooded area,across thefield, across the road into afarmhouse.
 
W e got into thefarm house.
 
In stea d
 
--
 
one jum pedto the door,had the door of  thefarmer's house open, and the otherfor 
us to go in.
 
W e weref ive years hungr y.
 
W e saw three big dishes of potatopeelings and white 
f l ou r .
 
W e left our two angels alone fora m inute.
 
W e cleaned thosetrays up.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of  the potato peelings.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
And the whitef lour that was anim alfeed.
 
Butwhen you're hungry, you 
don't designate animal feed f rom  regular f ood.
 
You're hungry.
 
You eat what you can.
 
 
Once we cleanedthose dishes out and we went inside, we didn't think it was going to 
be food
. 
T hat's why we  ateoutside because we didn't know.
 
Five years of  m istreating you and 
d
on't give you any food.
 
All of a sudden, now what I shouldhave thought thatthis is Am erica.
 
T he soldiers
, t
hey hadfor us a spread inside.
 
You can'tbelieve it, with all kinds of food, 
goodies in there.
 
 
But they wouldn't letus eatanym ore.
 
Drink lots of water
.  
You ate up all the peelings.
 
You're not hungry.
 
W ehave m ore hungry but we listened to them.
 
And wh
y 
we were drinking 
the water
? W
eheard voices in the same house, " Help, help.
 
Doctor, help."
 
T here was a group 
of  survivors there that survi ved the Death March and they wound up in the samefarmhouse.
 
Not with these two soldiers.
 
And so the soldiers went in to see what's wrong.
 
T hey ate that 
good f ood.
 
They probably overate and their stom ach wouldn'tagreewith them and they 
probably m essed up their stomach
. 
They think m aybe their stomach wouldn't accept the 
normal f ood.
 
ButI think they overate.
 
 
T hose two angels, dialed their num ber, they got them edics to come.
 
T hree hours later 
them edics cam eandgave each otherm edicine, the room with stom ach problems
.  
I showed 

14
 
 
onethe wound onm y head.
 
Ihad a scab, underneath inf ected.
 
Hecleaned it upfor me.
 
He  
bandaged it up nicely.
 
He cuthair around it.
 
 
I was a hum an being to him, not those anim als.
 
T hoseanim als would see I was 
wounded,I wouldn'tbe here speaking to you. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry, we are at the endofour tim e.
 
I wish we had another hour or two or 
three.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Oh , ye s. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
It would be a year later whenyou m ade it to the United States.
 
And you were 
able to reunite with
 
your brother who had left you in the woods.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
But I didn't know where that brother was.
 
And I didn't know where the 
Arm y brother was, Zachery.
 
T his was Dave.
 
He ran away with the soldier.
 
Idon't know whether 
he was with the soldier or him self  to Lithuania.
 
They had a Japanese 
Ambassador.
 
H e  wa s 
helping the Jews.
 
My brother didn'thave the beard,but
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He gothim  to the United States.
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
 
Yeah.
 
Anyway, he m ade af alse passport toget to Manjula
.  
T hen a 
te l
egram  to m
y sister inW ashington.
 
He came in 1941.
 
Im et up with m y other brother.
 
H e  wa s 
liberated in Poland.
 
And I was liberated in Germ any
, t
hrough that cousin, Ida.
 
S h e l ef t  f o r  
Poland to lookfor her brother.
 
Shef ound her brother in a displacedpersons camp inLodz, 
Poland.
 
Andher brother knew m y brother.
 
He traveled f rom  Lithuania
 
--
 
the Nazis caughthim  
as a war prisoner.
 
They didn't put him  in with them ilitary people asa soldierbecausehe was 
Je wish .  
T hey put him  intoa Jewish ghetto inLi
thuania.
 
So when the Russians left Poland,he 
went back to Poland.
 
He wound up in that sam edisplaced personscam p where m y cousin 
wa s .
 
 
W hen the two of us cam e to America, and I was expecting m y sister, afemale to com e 
pick us up, we seea man com ing clo

W hen he got closer,I said, 
ﬁ
I'll be darned

Dave?
 
W hat the heck are you doing here?
ﬂ ﬁ
Oh, I cam ehere in 1941.

ﬂ 
I said m yf ive sisters are gone.
 
I said you're looking atm e, and m y brother is here wi th

So it's the three brothers,and the sister in Am erica.
 
And I wasfree.
 
T hat was i

>> Bill Benson:
 
Henry
 
--
 
I wish we had tim efor you to ask questions of  Henry.
 
I don't think we

So I think we're going to have to stopf ornow.
 
Henr y is going to stay 
on the stage, however,  af ter wef inish.
 
So we're notdone qu

Anybody who wants to

Oh, youm ean, to leave with theaudience
? 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Henry Greenbaum :
O k.  
I don't want you tobe a bystander.
 
W henever you see any 
injustices done toany humanbeing, speak out.
 
If you can't do it yourself, get some help.
 
Ge t 
your parents, school teacher,principal, rabbi,or priest
 
to help you but don't leave thatperson 
unattended.
 
 
hey all gro wn up so no schoolhere.
 
But Ialways tell the children,don't bully anybody.
 
Do n ' t  bu lly.
 
T he person can't help the way they were born.
 
They have enough trouble looking 
in the m irror them se
l ve s .
 
So you treat them  a little kinder
. I
f  you don't feel likem arrying them , 
it's up to you.
 
It's up toyou.
 
But treat them  a little kinder.
 
 
Don't be abystander.
 
Speak out.
 
Andm aybe the young people
 
--
 
I don't think the 
world is going to stop killing
 
one another by our tim e, the survivors.
 
W eare passing onto the 
young ones.
 
W ehopeby the time the youngones get ourage, people will stop killing one 
another, they will be kinder to oneanother.
