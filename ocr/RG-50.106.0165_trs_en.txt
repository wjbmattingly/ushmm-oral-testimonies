Question: This is the 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Andrew Glass
, c o nducted by 
Gail Schwartz
 on 
February 14
th
, 2005, in 
Wa shington, D.C.
. This is tape number one, side
 A.
 Please 
give us your full name. 
Answer: I™m 
Andrew James Glass.
 The 
James,
 by the way is from my  parental 
grandfather 
Jacob
, who was shot by th e Nazis. 
Q: And the name that you we
re b -- given at birth? 
A: The same. The Po lish version of my  name is 
Andrej, 
which is spelled 
A-n-d-r-
e-j
, and as -- as in most Slavic countrie
s there™s also, for children and friends a 
dimunitive
, and the 
dimunitive
 for 
Andrew 
or 
Andrej
 in Polish is
 Andrush.
 
Q: And what is your date of birth? 

A: I was born November 30
th
, 1935.  
Q: And where were you born? 
A: In downtown 
Wa rsa w, P o la nd
, not in a hospital. 
Q: A-Actually at home? 
A: Yes, and I visited th -- my  place of birt
h as it were, and that is a story in itself, 
how as -- as we know, 
Warsaw
 was systematically destroyed by the Germans, but 
my house surviv ed, and I™ll explain 
a little bit later, if you care, why.

Q: What was the address of the house? 
A: Six 
Lvovaska  
Street. That™s spelled 
L-v-o-v-a-s-k-a, 
and it is in the heart of -- 
of 
Warsaw
.  
Q: Let™s now talk a little bit about your 
family, the prev ious generations, how far 
back that you know about and wh
ere they lived and so forth. 
A: My family on both
 my mother™s and father™s side 
are Polish. Myfa
ther™s family 
lived in 
Wa rsa w. 
We have the names of those who 
were my  grandfather and great-
grandfather and great-great-gra
n-grandfather. Going back 
I think to the latter part 
of the 18
th
 century. And I think my 
mother™s family was also
 Polish, although sh -- 
as a -- as a girl she lived in 
Mo scow 
during World War I. My father™s father, 
Jacob
 
was a banker, and he was totally assimila
ted  in the Polish culture, he -- although 
the family was Jewish, they 
regard ed themselves first as
 Poles and second as Jews. 
Remember that in the 
Warsaw 
of 1939, one third of the 
population was Jewish. It 
was very much of the -- a Jewish -- a cen
ter of Jewish culture and life. And my 
grandfather was a very successful banker in
 Warsaw
. One of the wealthiest men in 
Warsaw
 at the time. 
Q: And did he spell his name 
G-l-a-s-s
 also? 
A: Yes, 
Glass.
 I think i-in Polish pr
obably the pronunciation is di -- slightly 
different, slightly harder, but
 the spelling is the same.

Q: An-And your mother™s family? 
A: My mother™s family, my 
ra -- ma -- sorry. My maternal
 grandfather died at 55, 
although my  grandmother, interestingly 
sur -- not only survived the war, but 
managed to escape with us
, and lived to 96, in 
New York.
 Her -- she had one 
brother, who is still alive and 
he and his wife also surviv
ed, separately from us, but 
are st-still alive, although they™v
e lost their son who was born in 
Santa  Do mingo ,
 
and there™s a story there, too. 
Q: Well, now let™s talk about your parents. 
Wh at kind of work  did your father do? 
A: Well, my father was educated 
as a lawyer, he had a degree from
 Warsaw
 law 
school, and actually was in the sa me cla ss 
as the former late 
Prime Minister of 
Israel, Begin
, although I™m not sure they knew 
each other, but around the time that 
my  father graduated, wh ich was coincident
al with around the time I was born, that 
is the mid-30™s, Polish a-anti-Semitism beca
me much more prono
unced in degrees. 
And as a result of that, he could not practice law in 
Poland
. So  I think he just 
managed real estate properties for my  gran
dfather, including the one that we lived 
in, that I mentioned earlier. 

Q: And wa -- did your mother work ? 
A: No, no. My mother, who is
 still alive, she was born in
 1912, and so will be 93 
this year, unhappily suffered from postpar
tum psychosis when I was born, so I

didn™t see my mother -- although I didn™t
 hear about this until much later, until 
around th e time that I was two, two and 
a half. Although sh e re-recovered quite 
well, and in a very stressful time as we 
know war is for anyone, managed with out 
any mental problems. She™s had psychotic
 episodes since, but she™s come back 
from all of them. 
Q: How did your parents me et? 

A: I-In this climate of what might be ca
lled upper middle class, or even upper class 
Jews, there was -- e-everyone went to sc
hool togeth er, starting at a -- at a young 
age, in their -- their -- my parents are al
most exactly the same
 age. And these -- 
Polish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was 
explained to  me, peopl
e did not pair off 
until they married. So they di
d things in groups, went 
into the wood
s to find -- 
excuse me -- edible mushroom
s. Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in -- 
at the 
Baltic
 in a resort known as 
Sopot, S-o-p-o-t
. And then, in their early 20™s 
they paired off and my  parents paired o
ff and married. I think my father was -- my 
parents were 22 at the time. My father, by th e way, was the youngest of six or 

seven, I for -- forget, two of
 whom survived th
e war, besides my  father, but did not 
escape, they were -- they were in 
-- in the ge-German labor camps in 
Germany
, 
two sisters. And at that time, un-unde
r Po lish Jewish tradition, you weren't

supposed  to marry until your sisters marrie
d. So this was an elopement because it 
was a-against the tradition of the fam
ily. But somehow i-it all worked out. 
Q: How would you describe 
your parents? Di -- wha -- were they re-religious? It 
sounds like maybe they weren™t. 
A: Li-li -- my father was not an observant
 Jew, nor is my mother. However, they 
insisted that I have a Jewish education 
and I was -- at th at time we didn™t have 
Bar 
Mitzvahs,
 we had something called confirmation.
 So  I went thro ugh ab out a seven 
year program at 
Temple Emmanuel
 on 
Fifth
 Av enu e
 
and 
65
th
 
Street, which 
started actu ally shortly after I arrived in the 
United States
, and ended when  I was 
13. 
Q: So were they politica
lly active in any way? 
A: I wouldn™t say so. My -- 
Q: I-I™m talking about th
e very early years in 
Poland. 
A: Oh, in
 Poland
? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: No, no. There was no op
portunity, other -- y-you know -- you -- you mean in 
terms of -- of the -- the 
Bund
 or so mething like that? No. 
They -- they were not, at 
all, no. A-A-As the war approached, as -- st
rike that -- as it became clear, or clearer 
that 
Poland
 was in jeopardy from an -- Germ
an attack, the Poles made some

decisions wh ich changed my  parents fortunes
 greatly and to the 
worse. Pole -- the 
Polish government passed a decree in -- I be
lieve in the summer or
 spring of 1939, 
which was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser 
extent at Germans who controlled almo st 
all of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-
zlotys, 
held abroad by 
Poles, had to  be repatriated a
nd converted to  Polish money, the 
zloty. 
That law 
was, as you might imagine, not totally a
dhered to. In fact, there is now quite a 
number of cases involving funds that were put in 
Switzerland 
in secret accounts by 
precisely -- by contemporaries of my gr
andfather who were faced with this 
situation and whose heirs are now either r
eceiving or just seeking to prove that -- 
that these funds were theirs. But any even t, my  grandfather had considerable sums 
abroad in -- particularly in 
Switze rland
 and in  
New York
 and 
Lo ndon,
 i-in the 
order of millions of dollars. And in part be
cause he was a Polish patriot and in part 
because he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of th
is money was repatriated to 
Poland
, and there were no funds in 
New York
, there were no funds in any other 
place. So, when my parent
s eventually arrived in 
New York
 with a one week visa 
to stay in the 
United States
, they were -- they were 
destitute, pa -- financially 
destitute. Interestingly, my father -- a-
as you recall, in 1939 th ere was a World™s 
Fair in 
New York
, and the ability of Poles, particul
arly of -- of people of means to 
get 
U.S.
 visas to visit the World™s Fair was 
-- wa -- things kind of opened up, you

could -- you could get a -- a visa to go to
 the World™s Fair, and you could take a 
ship from 
Poland
 or from 
France
 and come here tha -- in
 the summer of 1939. My 
father proposed to my  grandfather that he 
-- when  this law was passed, that he sign 
hi -- these assets over to my father and that
 my father come oste
nsibly to visit the 
World™s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably  correct, that if he was 

sitting in
 New Yo rk
 with four or five million dolla
rs, that you could probably find 
a -- a ways and means not to get kicked ou
t. But my  grandfather vetoed the plan 
and I often wondered how my  life would have
 changed if -- for the better or for the 
worse, had he said, all right, go to 
New York
, and if they had arrived in 
New Yo rk
 
in that fashion rather than 
in the rather different circum
stances that brought us to 
the 
United States
. 
Q: Did your parents ever talk to you 
later about anti-Se-S
emitism that they 
experienced when you were 
still too young, obviously 
to know about it, before 
September ™39? Did they tell you of
 any incidents that happened? 
A: Well, as I said, he was unable to -- to
 practice hi -- the profession to wh ich he 
was trained, but -- 

Q: Any specific personal -- do you know
 what I mean? Very, very personal 
instances?

A: I don™t think so because 
they were living in -- in -- 
pretty much in isolation. 
Now, I put isolation in qu
otes because if you have a -- a million fellow Jews in 
Warsaw
, you can find your way around. 
My father™s resentment against 
Poland
, 
which he held until his death in 1993, wa
s really centered 
around Polish anti-S-
Semitism that was displayed after the war 
began, and during the war. And he wrote 
many letters, some to the 
New York Times
, some of -- of which were published, to 
the Jewish publications and so on and 
was e-extremely active in Jewish charities 
during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly
 t h e United Jewish Appeal. And so his -
- his resentment was that 
[indecipherable]
 resentment is that the Poles aided and 
abetted the systematic slaughter of Polish Jews. 
Q: What is your very first memory? You sa
id you were born in November ™35, so 
what di -- can you recall 
the very first memory? 
A: Yes, I remember as a very
 small child being in pa -- 
with -- not with my mother 
but with a -- a nursemaids in 
-- ah, there was a beautiful 
park near where we lived 
called park 
azienki
 which is still there, and I reme
mber the peacocks in the park. 
But one of my earliest 
memories is of the 
Stuka
 dive bomb ers bombing 
Wa rsa w, 
and the noise, and seeing the bombs fa
ll on the city and seeing the bombers, 
because they were -- dr-dropped their 
bombs from very low altitude and they 
would dive and then  pull 
up and it was an extremely -- but the noise of the

February 14, 2005

airplanes and noise of the bombs made 
an impression for someone who was living 
in central 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So we™re talking about September ™39? 
A: Exactly, we™re talking about the first 
two weeks of September, 1939. And I have 
only very  hazy memo ries of my  -- our flight from 
Warsaw
 east . Mos-Most of that 
is not recaptured memory so much as what I™ve been told
 by my parents. 
Q: No, it™s obvious that we know th at ma
ny of the things you™re telling us wh en 
you -- before you were born obviously, and 
wh en you were very young is wh at you 
learned fro-from your -- your parents. Did -- did they tell you that they tried, 
besides the 
New York
 World™s Fair, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other 
way? 

A: No, my father was very 
much a man of the world, Imean he -- he tr -- had the 
E n cy clo p ed ia  B r itann i ca  
at home, so he spoke some English, which was a -- a 
great benefit. He spoke Russian and 
German. He traveled some with my 
grandfather. I was conceived on a cruise to the fjords of 
Norway
. So he was a -- h-
he -- the radio at that time -- and I rememb
er my father telling me about listening to 
the speeches of 
Adolf Hitler
 on th-the radio, of course. 
Warsaw
 was not that far 
from 
Berlin
 and everyone had a shortw ave set 
so you could listen to -- to the 
German radio, and my father being fair
ly fluent in Germ
an could understand 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

Hitler™s 
sp eeches and how mesmerizing 
Hitler 
was, although he disagreed with, 
obviously with everything that he had to 
say. So they were ri
s -- I would say my  
father particularly but my mother as well,
 were resourceful people who, at a very 
critical stag e in the war, in 
the first weeks of the war, to
ok some dramatic steps to 
save their lives and my life. And we
 can talk about that if you like. 
Q: What language did you speak at home? 
A: Oh, that™s funny, because when my mo
ther was ill I spent a 
lot of time in my 
grandparent™s home, and th at was the -- a poly -- 

Q: Glot. 

A: Polyglot. Sorry. Po lyglot household with
 Po lish, of course, but also English, 
French, German spoken, and I rememb er as 
one of my  first memo ries actually, or -- 
I-I -- I don™t know if it™s a memory or if it was reported back to me as that I ask ed 

my  grandfather
 Jadush
, which means grandfather in 
Polish, wh-when will I get my 
own language? The idea being th at I had to
 converse with the nanny in French and 
with the maid in Polish a
nd others in Russian and Ge
rman and so I had -- I™ve 
never had a particularly strong facility
 for languages, but as a child I did. 
Q: So now you™re saying th at y
our first recollection is when 
Wa rsaw
 was being 
bombed, and did you -- again, you were 
so very young, but were your parents 
comforting, did they  ex
plain anything to you? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005

A: No. I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you 
know, wh en the war began in the first 
week of September, my father, who had 
so mewhat impaired vision and was also 
Jewish, for both those reasons was not draf
ted into the Polish army. But -- and the 
war began, either -- I™m not clear whethe
r it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft 
basis, was inducted into  a kind of home 
army  or home civil defense corps, who-
whose primary task was to fill sandbags ar
ound public buildings and to clear the 
rubble from the German bombings. And t-to pu
t up defenses as it were against -- ba 
-- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- 
of other public monuments and buildings 
being bomb ed in subsequent days. In any 
event this was almost a full-time job, he 

just was rarely home, as that wa s reported to me. In about the 12
th
 day of the war, 
he was working alongside a stranger who 
happened -- a Gentile, who happened to 
be a taxi driver. And they began talking 
ab out what a good id ea it might be for both 
families to get the heck out of 
Wa rsa w
, since the bombing was continuing and 
intensifying, and sin
ce the evidence from the 
BBC
 and from German radio, if not 
Polish radio was that the G-Germans were
 coming closer and 
you could hear the 
artillery fire from three sides. So the proble
m was that the taxi driver didn™t have 
any gas for his taxi. And this part was alwa
ys -- I never could get my  father to quite 
explain whether he had a stas
h of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew 
how on the black market to get it, it was 
always fuzzy. But the bottom line is, my 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
12
father procured gas for this taxi. So taxi
 plus gas meant that 
both families fled in 
the dawn  hours of September 13
th
. I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you 
can check it -- the -- th e bridges across the
 Vistula
 were severed. 
Warsaw 
itself 
held out against German attack until the 
end of the month. And some people also 
escaped by boat and so on and fo und ways 
out. But basically we left and traveled 
east, around the time that that opportunity 
shut down . Others traveled south toward
 
Romania
 and su rvived, but we traveled due ea
st until the taxi ran out of gas, and 
then we separated from the taxi driver a
nd his family and we somehow got a horse 
and cart and kept going east. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit more about your leaving 
Warsaw
. You again were very , 
very young. Do you rememb
er that, and if so do you rememb er your emotions and 
the understanding of -- I mean
, you were just a toddler. 
A: I was just a toddler, I was just four, 
I only cou -- one can has -- have memo ries 
from that time, particu larly if
 there™s an abrupt change in
 your life, and I have very 
sh- shady memories of that time as -- but la
ter on, that is a year later, we ended up 
across the border in
 Lithuania
 and I do remember living in 
Lithuania
 quite 
clearly, and everything since then. 
Q: Do you -- did your mo ther ever tell 
you wh at she brought 
with her -- when a 
family has to leave a home like that so 
suddenly, wh at your fo lks took with them? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
13
A: Yes, she did. They to ok nothing. And th
-the -- in that there™s a story, because 
my father™s pants, with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of 
a -- a temporary exhibit at the Holocaust 
Museum some years ago on a group of 
about 2200 Polish Jews who fled
, who were able to reach 
Japan
, and many of 
whom, not all, but ma ny of wh om survived
 because of that. An
d so the point of 
putting his pants in the exhibit was that th
at was the only thing 
he had and that was 
the only pants he ha -- he wore f-from the time that he left 
Warsaw
, I think, til the 
time he arrived in th e 
United States
. They were rather good 
pants, but they  -- they 
saw a lot of adventure through th e -- here and there. 
Q: D-Do  you have any memo ry of that
 taxi ride with the other family? 
A: Very faintly. Just remember being pi
cked up at -- somehow, and bundled  in a -- 
in a crowded black taxi and remember cr
ossing the brid ges. I had never been to  
Praga
, which is the suburb of 
Poland
 that is directly east of the city, and so I think 
I have a slight memo ry of crossing th
e river, but that™s it. No, not really. 
Q: Did you have a favorite t
oy with you, do you know th at? 

A: I had no toys, nothing,
 no. When I 
returned to 
Wa rsaw
, well after the war, and 
went to the apartment that I 
grew up in -- well, I di -- I lived in til I was four, I was 
able to recall the apartment vividly. I me
an, exactly where my room was, where the 
kitchen was, where the a -- 
the attic that was there wh
ich they didn™t know about, 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

because it was on the top floor, and had been
 sealed. The apartment itself had been 
divided during the co mmunist period in to 
six apartments, with a kind of a -- a 
frozen glass partitions going down the central
 hallway. But the -- the -- arriving at -
- at the apartment house, I had no prob
lem finding th e -- the elevator, which was 
still the same elevator, finding the apartm
ent -- I think there were three or four 
apartments on each floor, fi
nding the right apartment 
and then finding my way 
around the apartment, even
 though it had been substantially remodeled. 
Q: During the bombing in th
e first weeks of September, was your neighborhood as 
-- a-affected, damaged? 

A: I don™t know. No, I think that the bombing was mainly 
around the public 
buildings, which were a few miles away. Of 
course, o-over time, and particularly in 

1944, the entire neighborhood
, save for my  house, apartment house, was leveled, 
and I may as well tell you why. A-Around
 the corner from the apartment house 
there was and still is a gymnasium, a high 
school which became during the uprising 
of the Po lish Ho me Army , the hundred  or so days that the Po les fought the 

Germans, while the Russians sat 
on th e east side of the river -- 
Q: You™re talking ab out 1944. 
A: I™m talking about 1944. That was -- th
at w as the hi -- that was a -- a major 
military headquarters for 
the Germans. So the Germ
ans were systematically

blowing up the city, that part of the city
 that had not already been blown up in  
earlier fighting, or in  con-continuing figh
ting. But the German officers needed a 
place to live, or sleep anyway. And so  ou
r -- our house, which 
was directly around 
the -- around the corner from the 
gymnasium
 was designated as a billet for Nazi 
generals, and th erefore, while it had a lot of
 bullet holes in it, some of which were 
still evident when I returned to 
Wa rsa w
 in 1977 with President
 Carter
, that was 
one of the few houses in central 
Warsaw
 that did surv ive.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Andrew Glass
. This is tape number one, side
 B. 
And we were 
talking about how y
our family left 
Warsaw
 in the taxi and then the gas ran out. 
And where were you then? 
A: Well, as you know,
 around September 17
th
 or 18, the secret codicil of the mos -- 
Moscow
-
Berlin 
axis was put into 
play, the so-called 
Molo tov-Ribbon -- 
Ribbentrop 
Pact -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- under which the -- the Soviets invade
d from the east and there was a line or 
demarcation, so we soon fo und ourselve
s among Soviet troops who were headed

west while we were headed east. And th
is was also a risk because we were 
evidently bourgeois, educated, and there were -- I would say my  father told me, and 
I have no firsthand knowledge of this, but
 quite a few arbitrary arrests of people 
who they just didn™t like, or who the local 
Polish peasantry turned in, or whatever. 
And that was a risk, so you really didn™t
 want to s-stay in Soviet occupied  
Poland
, 
and we managed to find ou
r way -- illegally, of course -- across the border to 
Lithuania
 where, once we were in 
Lithuania,
 the Lithuanian government accepted 
us as Polish refugees. 
Q: D-Do  you rememb er any of the town
s that you passed thro ugh, or did your 
parents tell you later, or do yo
u have any recollection of th
at part of the journey? 
A: No, none at all. I th ink part of it was 
by train, and part of it was on foot. Some of 
it was on -- by horse and wagon. I do remember 
Wilno
 quite -- quite well though, 
which was the --  

Q: So that was your destination to -- to -- 
A: That was the destination and that waswhere we stayed when
 we were in -- in 
Lithuania
. Now, what™s important about th at tim
e is that at the 
time we arrivedin 
Lithuania
, although there was a strain be
tween the Po lish and Lithuanian 
governments having to do with the arrange
ments after World War I, we were ra-

rather well received, and my father was able to actually earn some
 kind of living by 
buying and selli
ng stuff. And -- 
Q: What kind of stuff? 
A: Diamond rings, and gold and people 
wanting to  -- currency manipulation, 
dollars and British pounds 
and so on. He was operatin
g on the fringes of the 
galaxy, but during th at time there was a pr
ogressive tightening of the noose by the 
Soviets. At first it was to insist on a ch
ange of government that was mo re friendly 
to the Soviet point of view, then  that gove
rnment invited, quote unquote, Soviets to 
open bases in 
Lithuania
 and eventually that led to 
a de facto Soviet occupation 
much like the S-Syrians in 
Lebanon
 and th en finally to annexation of 
Lithuania
 as 
a 
SSR
 as the Soviet Socialist Republic, whic
h it continued to be until 1991. So  we 
lived through all of that, and during the time we were in 
Lithuania
, the -- the 
Soviet presence and the s -- importance of 
the Soviets materially increased. Now, 
my  father, if I may continue, didn™t stay in 
Lithuania
 because he was -- and again, 
he was very  vague on this, whether he was 
in the underground, or whether it, as is 
mostly presented to me, that he want
ed to get his father out, who was in 
Warsaw
. 
So he made his way thro ugh the S
oviet and German lines, back to 
Wa rsa w 
on two 
occasions, and returned to 
Wa rsaw
 in the l -- winter of 1939 - 1940 and tried to 
convince my grandfather to l
eave with him, and with my grandmother as well, and

they refused, and gave reasons why they 
wouldn™t go. The reason 
is that basically 
they survived Worl
d War I, and while there were 
privations and problems, and 
several armies swept through 
Warsaw
, the Prussians, the Au
strians, the Russians 
and so on, basically civilians
 survived and were not c
onsidered combatants. World 
War II, of course, had a much different as
pect. And so  the idea of going into the 
Polish countryside, which was believed to 
be anti-Semiti c and dangerous, th-the 
idea of leaving his town house slash mans
ion was unappealing to my grandfather, 
who was then in his late 50™s. 
Q: So now you are in -- you said in 
Vilnius
? Is that where you settled in 
Lithuania
? 
A: Yes, but there™s a st -- there™s a story 
involving my  father™s second trip back in 
the winter of 1940. At -- by that time, 
the Polish Lithuanian border was patrolled 
both by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, bu
t not jointly. And on his way back from 

the second, fu
tile mission to 
Wa rsa w
, he was walking along th e railroad track in 
the snow with the pair of pants that 
ended up in the mu seum, and he was a-a-
arrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian 
patrol. My father said that had he 

encountered  a Soviet patrol there would ha
ve been no question that he would have 
been shot, because he had no pr
oper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with 

-- at least suspicious, and pr
obab ly a spy. Any even t, the Lithuanians, according to

my  father™s story, took him to their outpos
t, gave him his watch and gave him his 
money, gave him his shoes, 
and was kind of held there 
for overnight, and in the 
morning, not knowing what his fate 
would be, the -- the captain, who was 
somewhat educated, said, we
™ve been thinking ab out your 
situation and what we™ve 
decided is that we™re going to ask you a qu
estion. And based on your answer to this 
question, quite frankly, we™re either going 
to sh -- let you go or shoot you. Which 
was -- kind of concen trated his mi nd. So th
e question, wh ich my  father repeated in 
Lithuanian
 
is, or was -- 
[speaks Lithuanian here]
. Is 
Roosevelt -- 
President 
Roosevelt
 a Jew? And my  father™s response, ac
cording to my  father was, what a 
silly question, why woul
d you ask me a quest ion like that? Everybody knows 
Roosevelt™s 
Jewish. And then they sa
id, all right, get out of 
here. And he walked in 
the snow in his socks and so mehow made it back to 
Wilno
. So that -- I think that 
story is worth mem- me mo rializing beca
use it epitomizes -- you say in Polish 
[speaks Polish here]
, which means, yi -- it was such
 a time, which never existed 
before and will never exist again. 
[speaks Polish here]
. And that was a -- a 
vignette from that time. 

Q: So th en he got back to you. 
A: Yeah, then -- o-of course there was -- 
there were -- he was looking to get -- I 
mean, knowing that the Soviets were 
tightening their noose around the --

Lithuania
 and that it was an unhealthy place to 
-- to remain and of course the story 
of the Lithuanian Jews is a very sad stor
y, very few, if any,
 survived after the 
Germans invaded in June of 1941. So in th
at winter, he en -- made a really great 
effort to try to get out and we were very 
fortunate that through a strange series of 
circumstan ces we were able to leave. And 
it -- we may be described as a trifecta i-
in the sense that there were three elemen
ts to  -- to it, and if any of the three 
elements failed, we woul
d have not survived . The 
first element was a -- a 
Dutchman who was the honorary cons
ul of the Dutch government in 
Lithuania
 
and whose job was to sell 
Philips 
radios. And he decided th
at anyone who ap plied 
could get residence in 
Cura çao 
wh ich was then a Dutch colony. Course, what was 
not known is that the governor of 
Cura çao 
was not allowing anybody to  get in, but 
you could get a piece of paper that said yo
u had residence status or invitation to 
become a resident of the island of 
Curaçao. 
And with  that piece of paper you could 
then seek transit visas to get to 
Curaçao. 
Yo u needed basically three visas. You 
needed  a Ru ssian -- Soviet visa, you needed
 a Japanese visa, then you needed  to 
cross the 
Atlantic
 and get an American visa to get you to 
Curaçao. 
So there was in 
-- and this is very well known and we don™t 
have to go into  de
tail about this, there 
was a Japanese council in 
Lithuania
, in the Lithuanian 
capital, kow -- kow
 -- 
Kowsis?

Q: 
Kaunas
. 
A: 
Kaunas
 -- named 
Sigahura
, who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the Japanese 
embassy some years ago, and who issued
 2200 of -- of these transit visas to 
Japan, 
which he did wi -- against the express orde
rs of the Japanese foreign ministry in 
Tokyo -- 
to Jews. And our names and the reco rd 
is there, it™s on the internet, too. 
We got three of these, and with that -- th
at was two -- two parts of the trifecta. The 
third part -- and this part is less well known
 and deserves to be discussed in some 
detail, was to get the Soviet -- pe
rmission from the Soviets to leave 
Vilnius
 and to 
travel to 
Japan
. And th ey were selling a package deal, wh ere you got the visa, and 
the ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, 
which at that time was so mething like a 
16 day trip from 
Moscow
 to 
Vladivostok
. And if you ask what I remember, I 
reme mb er that trip very vividly, because
 it was in the winter of 1940, and it was 
very cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turn
ing five. So the first problem was how to 
get -- because the Soviets said, the only wa
y you could get this
 -- and we needed 
600 dollars for three visas, the only way 
you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the 
only way the Soviets would do business with
 you was in dollars
. And any resident 
of 
Vilnius
 who was caught with do
llars on his or her possession was automatically 
shipped to 
Siberia
, but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. You 
needed  the dollars in order 
to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was

prima facie 
evidence that you were -- had illegal
 currency and you were subject to 
immediate arrest. My father -- I don™t know
 if this is part of this -- I guess, 
surviving the Ho locaust, so we can go wi
 -- through th is if you like. My father 
came up with an ingenious plan. He had a do
uble envelo pe. He put the money in an 
envelope, and in  the o -- in the outer envelo
pe he said, this money is to be used  

solely and only for the purpose of attaini
ng three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather, 
transit visas to -- through the 
Soviet Union. 
And some of these visas were granted, 
and some people were arrested, as I was to
ld. And some visas were not granted, but 
they were not arrested. Almost
 all the interviews took place around th ree or four in 
the morning tha -- you 
were summoned to  the 
KGB
 headquarters where all this 
was happening in down town 
Vilnius
. And among th e questions that were asked 
was, if you do go to the new 
wo rld, if you do get to the 
United States
, w-would 
you be interested in help
ing us, helping the great 
Soviet Unio n 
comp lete its 
mission of liberating the world. In other 
words, would you s -- become a -- a sp y, 
or an agent. So this was a 
very difficult time. And the thir
d part of this trifecta, I 
think my father is proudest
 of having navigated that pa
rticular rapids. And so we 
did get those visas,
 and we did go to  
Mo sco w
, I do remember 
Moscow
 in 1941. 
Q: Let™s back up a little b it. So you™re -- before you 
get onto the Trans-Siberian 
railroad, do you have 
any other memo ries of 
Vilnius
? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
23
A: Well, just the apartment that we lived
 in, and eating a lot of bread and salami , 
which I -- and cheese, which is what I th
ink we surviv ed on. And I have some 
pictures I think, still, of -- one or two pi
ctures of that would -- somehow survived 
from there. Oh, there was al
so a -- a document which 
has survived, asking my 
father to bring back some kind of 
salamis or something from -- from the 
United 
States
, I guess, I don™t know, but there wa
s -- there was a -- a request for, you 
know, send -- send food back to 
Lithuania, 
so  -- from -- from a Jap anese diplomat. 
It was all a very strange time. 
Q: And what -- was it a fearful time fo
r you as a young child? A
nd -- and if so, did 

your parents explain then wh at was happening? 
A: No, not at all. I have to 
stress it was not fearful for me, I felt quite safe, and i-i-is 
-- I had a sense of adventure. I mean, I -- one
 of my memories is, as the train pulled 
into 
Vladivostok
 and we were being carried, b
ecause there was a considerable 
distance from the railh ead to th
e pier, where the Japanese ship was going to  take us 
to the west coast of 
Japan
, and being carried by my 
father, you know, because it 
was too far to walk and it was quite cold -- 
Q: Te-Tell me more ab out the train ride. 
A: Train ride was interesting that -- that -- that -- that were great 
[indeciphera ble] 
of ours on -- on the train wi-with tea, so 
I -- I was introduced to tea and I -- ever 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

24
since then I™ve been a tea dr
inker. And there was also a 
yeshiva
, a whole 
yeshiva
 
of about a hundred or so of th -- among 
th ese 2200 who were on th e train and who 
kept pretty much to themse
lves, but I rememb er the -- you know, the black coats, 
and the -- 
Q: So th ere were 2200 Jews
 on this train leaving? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, th ere might
 have been at most severa
l hundred, but there were 
2200 exit visas i ssued
. So not all the people who got ex
it visas got Soviet vi -- not 
all the people who got -- excuse me -- not 
all the people who got transit visas from 
Sigahura 
made it t-th rough 
Russia
. Some didn™t try, some tried and couldn™t and 
th-the -- the visas were staggered over 
some time and so the departures were 
staggered over some time. So we were, I th
ink, toward the middle, but I -- th-that™s 
a -- I™m not sure of that. 

Q: So what -- when did you
 actually leave? When di
d the train depart? Do you 
know the date?  
A: Pretty much. Backing up, we left 
Japan
 
[buzzer] [in a udible] --
 we left 
Japan 
in 1941. We left 
Japan
 in the latter part of April 1941 on the 
Ka ma ku ra  Ma ru
 to 
sail to 
Honolulu
 and eventually to 
Sa n F rancisco
, arriving in 
Sa n F rancisco
, I 
think, in early May of 1941. We arrived in 
Japan 
in December of 1940, and we 
were in the 
Soviet Unio n 
about two months until we got 
the train, so that meant 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
25
that we probably left 
Vilnius
 around octo -- middle of October of 1940, or about a 
year after the war began. 
Q: So you were there for 
almost a year in -- in 
Vilnius? 
A: Yes, except for the time that 
we were in -- making our way to 
Vilnius
 -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: --but I would say th e better -- yes,
 the better part of a year, yes.  
Q: Mm-hm. Any other memo
ries of the train ride, 
or we exhausted that? 
A: Y-Y-Yeah. I remember being -- we were in -- 

Q: Did you sleep in beds? 

A: No, no, there was a -- second class cars 
and -- but I rememb er arriving in -- the 
Russian winter, as you know, starts fair
ly early, so it was the latter p art of 
November, 1940, in 
No vo sibirsk
 where the train stopped, and it was about 40 
below. And the only thing for sale at the st
ation, which I bought, or was bought for 

me, was 
moroshne
, ice cream. It was, I think an in
teresting -- I™ve later been back 
to 
No vo sibirsk
 and remembered that. 
Q: Did you have warm clothes? 

A: Well, the train was warm. The train was fine. 
Q: And your parents were able to get you cl -- more clothes to wear when you were 
in 
Vilnius
? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
26
A: I-I don™t remember being cold. And we 
were there basically during the spring, 
summer an d fall, so we were there during the warm weather. 

Q: And you always had enough food? 
A: We always had enough food. And a -- and a -- a sense of I -- so rt of suspended 
animation. I mean, remember 
my father was -- and mother were 28 at the time. So 
they were ju st young people, and they were
 gaming the system, to try to figure out 
how to survive, and -- and did. 
Q: So now you™ve gotten off the train in 
Vladivostok
? 
A: Oh, there™s also an interesting story ab
out that, which is th
at there was a small 
group of Jews living in 
Japan
 as traders, who had been
 there for quite -- quite 
some time and were 
[indecipherable]
. And the Japanese required a rather large 
bond, a security bond, or -- fo
r each person who got off the 
boat, to ensure that they 
would not become dependents of the Japanese
 state, or to ensure that they would 
leave when their Japanese visas expired, 
or wh atever. Anyway , they had to co me 

up with a lot of money per capita tax or
 bond. And there -- somehow, there was -- 
the last guy off the boat was a Gentile 
and had somehow got mixed in with this 
group of 
yeshiva
 people and with  my  parents, 
who were traveling. I would say 
there were maybe 300 people on th
e boat, that would be about right. 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
27
Q: All the people on the boat were the one
s who had been on the railroad, is that 
correct? 
A: All the people on the boat
 were the ones who had reached 
Vladivostok
 from 
Moscow
 on the train, which 
took 15 days to cross. 
Q: Wh -- wa -- were there other children on 
the train that you play
ed with or talked 
to? 

A: I don™t rememb er any, no,
 no, I don™t re -- there 
may have been, but I don™t 
remember any. I reme
mber children on the 
Ka ma ku ra  Ma ru
 because there was 
also a -- a zoo that was traveling to 
San Francisco -- 
or not a zoo, a circus, and 
there were tigers and lions in cages on the 
-- on th e deck and so I rememb er playing 
with the kids and with -- 
with the wild animals as 
it were, but -- and seeing how 
close we could come without getting swip ed. 
But just to finish, 
so these -- so my 
father again, told me the story that this
 one Gentile fellow, who somehow was also 
a refugee, but wasn™t affected -- didn™t -- di
dn™t have the same story as we did, th-
th-the Japanese -- th-the -- the Jewish Japa
nese said okay, we™ll take him too. In 
other wo rds, why -- why wo
uld we send him back to 
Russia
? Even though he™s not 
Jewish, we™ll take care of him. 
Q: So you land in 
Japan
, and how long -- and t-t-tell -- tell about the life there. 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
28
A: Well, I remember
 Japan
 very clearly. This is, of course, pre-war 
Japa n
. I 
reme mb er d own town
 Tokyo 
very well. And I remember, in
 fact, riding in a trolley 
car, they had green trolley cars and we were
 passing the imperial palace, the tro lley 
car passed in front of the palace, and all of 
the ri -- passengers got out of their seats 
and bowed in the direction of the pal
aces toward the emperor. And I remember 
asking my  mo ther why were
n™t we bowing too, and sa
id well that™s, you know -- 
she said something in 
the effect -- effectively, that™s
 not our th ing, that™s the local 
thing and we don™t do that. But I rememb er the department store 
Takashima
, 
where there was a 14 story department stor
e that was -- had a -- a three story slide 
on th e roof, and how exciting it was for me 
to slide -- walk up the ladder -- and my 
parents let me do it, slide down these three 
st ories, so -- that 
was a time when my 
father™s main occupation 
was finding a way out of 
Japan
. And he managed to do 
so by getting a residence visa to the 
Dominican Republic,
 who were -- at that time 
the dictator of the 
Dominican Republic
, 
Trujillo
 was interested in Europeanizing 
and bringing in educated Eu
ropeans into -- into the -- 
Hispanio la. 
And so we were 
granted th ree visas, residence visas to the 
Dominican Republic
, and on th e basis of 
that visa, we got one week transit visas from the American consul in 
Tokyo
. So 
that when  we
 got off the 
Kamakura Maru
, we could get on a train in 
Sa n

Francisco
, change in trains in 
Chicago
 and then take a train to 
New York
 and then 
take a ship to the 
Dominican Republic, 
but we never did that. 
Q: Did you know y
ou were going to the 
United States
? You, as a child. 
A: No. No, I didn™t. I mean
, I knew I was crossing the 
Pacific
 
Ocean
 and I have 
very clear memories of -- of 
Pearl Harbor 
and 
Honolulu
 wh en  th e sh
ip docked 
there for a couple of days, 
bu-but -- before it went on. 
Q: Well again, I -- obviously yo u still were v ery young. Did the 
United States
 
mean anything? Did 
America  
have any meaning fo r you in any sense? 
A: No, not at all, it was just
 the great adventure, that we were traveling. I mean, 
we™d been  on th is train, and no
w we were on -- and living in 
Japan
 was a lot of 
fun, cause I was kind of a street kid, an
d learning Japanese very quickly. And then 
being on this boat. And that took ab
out, oh, three w
eeks to cross the 
Pacific. 
It 
wasn™t a fast boat. And it was a lot of fun,
 I mean, I would go with my  parents into 
these very hot baths wh ich th
e Japanese had, and then  y
ou™d get out of the bath and 
have a cold bucket of ice water thrown  on y
ou. It was a lo t of fun. I didn't feel I was 
a refugee in that sense, no. 
Q: Were there other Jewish children there that you played  with in  
Japan
? 
A: I suppose so. I -- I rememb er playing 
with Japanese kids, but this was a -- you 

know, a lot of the Japanese -- 
a lot of the people in our 
[indeciphera ble]
 did not

get these Dominican visas. Some of th
em got Dutch visas to go to the Dutch 
East 
Indies
. And they su ffered terribly, many of 
them died, wi -- after the Japanese 
invasion of what is now 
Indonesia
. The ones, the 
[indecipherable]
 people, the 
ones who could get visas to nowhere, when
 th e war began about six months after 
we left 
Japan, 
went to
 Shanghai 
and spent the war in 
Shanghai
. None of them 
stayed in 
Japan
. And the Jewish community in 
Shanghai
, I just know anecdotally, 
while had many privations, basically surv
ived, too. Many of them made it to 
Australia, South America,
 some to the 
United States
. So it™s literally, I mean, 
and quite clearly a -- a Diaspora.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Andrew Glass
. This is tape number two, side
 
A,
 and I was just wondering if you had an
ything mo re to say about docking in  
Hawaii
 and staying there for a little bit. 
A: Well, these are events th
at took place 65 years ago,
 so forgive me, but young 
people are impressionable, a
nd of course this was what, about six months or so, a 
little less than six months be
fore the Japanese bombed 
Pearl Harbor
, so we saw it. 
Seeing the 
Pacific
 fleet was very impressive, t
oo. A-All those battleships and 
aircraft carriers in one place. Probably 
not a good idea, but 
that was where they 
were, and we -- I think we -- my father mu
st have had some money, a little bit of 
money, because he chartered a -- or hired 
a taxicab and we kind of took a trip 
around th e island to just s -- go to 
Diamondhead
 and -- and see. It was one of 
those beau tiful spring da
ys that you have in  
Hawaii
, so I have a clear memory of 
that. And then a -- of course
 a memory of arriving in 
San Francisco 
and the 
Golden Gate 
bridge, and -- but we were there just
 for a day or so before we got on 

a train to -- to 
New York.

Q: While your father -- while your pare
nts and you were traveling, did you sense 
any concern or any wo rry or 
any tension about their havi
ng to leave their families 
back in 
Poland
, and were they aware of what was happening there? 
A: Oh well, there wasn™t an -- this was earl
y in th -- relatively early in the war, and 
while we knew that the -- the Nazis were 
anti-Semitic an d we kn
ew that a lot of 
Jews had left because of that, we hadno idea of the Holocaust, per se, no. My 

father wanted very much to get his family 
out because he feared 
for their lives, this 
early. But he had no direct evidence othe
r than, as we know, the creation of the 
ghetto, th e -- the tightening of the noose, 
as it were, the -- m-my grandfather never 
went to the ghetto, it -- th
ey -- when it became clear
 he couldn™t stay in 
Warsaw
 
any more, they went to 
a small to wn in eastern 
Poland
 where they  we
re eventually 
shot in 1943. 

Q: Do  yo u  k now wh at to wn  th at was?  

A: I can find out, and my father told me
, but I -- it do -- it doesn™t -- but h-he f -- 
they f -- after the war, my father was in 
contact with people who were there at the 
time and remembered the round
-up and when -- when they 
were shot. So they were 
never in -- in a death camp, they were just
 hauled out of their -- where they were 
staying and -- and killed. Incidentally, I had a maternal great-grandmother who, at 
the time the war began was 103. And sh e ended up in a small town not too far from

Warsaw
, and when  she was 104, she was doing 
so me, what might be called relief 
work . She was bringing food to  Jews wh
o were hiding and so mething like th at, 
never fearing fo r her own life, but there wa
s a curfew. After dark you were subject 
to arrest or worse, and she was summar
ily shot. So sh e ended her life with a 
German bullet at 104. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: I -- I can  look that up for you. I have it in -- in my computer, but it doesn™t come 
to -- I think ste -- 
Stefa n ia
, something like that. 
Stefania Glass.  
Q: So you™re in the 
United States
, and your -- you™ve left 
California
, you said, 
and you™re on your way to 
New Yo rk
? 
A: Yeah, I was a kid in -- in 
New York,
 and my father an -- tried to find some 
work. He contacted my -- his father™s br oker, my grandfather™s broker, who -- I -- I 
don™t know if they lent him some mone
y, they  possibly did. Bu t since my  
grandfather had millions of dollars invested in 
Wa ll
 Street, they -- until he pulled it 
out, they -- I mean, they wrote a le -- a le
tter o f reference for my father, which he 
sought to use effectivel
y with the immigratio n au
thorities stalling them from 
deporting him because we were illegal a
liens. And while that case was pending 
against us, trying to  get us to leave the country, the Japanese bombed 
Pearl 
Harbor
 and started World War II. And under Am
erican law at the time, my father,

who was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar wi
th American immigration law, and we -
- and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department
 had every right to deport us. But under 
U.S.
 law they could only deport us to the 
country that we had immediately entered 
from, which was the empire of 
Japan
. Or our native country, which was the 
Poland
 that was under German occupation. So  
they said you had to
 leave, but there 
was a catch 22 there in our favor. They co
uldn™t tell us where to go, cause there 
was no place to go. And then, during th e 
war, of course, th-there was -- as you 
know, under the immigration law there wa
s a Polish quota, and that Polish quota 
for immigrants was subscrib
ed until something 
like 1960, 20 year
s. But President
 
Roosevelt
 signed an executive order that basically
 said that unfilled slots, that is 
people wh o were supposed to arrive say 
in 1942, but didn™t arrive because they  
were trapped behind German lines, an -- 
those slots could be
 filled by people who 
have -- who are otherw ise of good char
acter, never mind how th ey got here. And 
on that basis, I think around 1943, while
 we were still in limbo as it were, we 
emigrated to 
Ca na da
 and re-entered as le-legally 
with -- with these immigration 
visas that were given to us in 
Ca nada
. And then in 1948 we became 
U.S.
 citizens, 
five years later. I became a
 U.S. 
citizen, 1948. 
Q: What was your first impression as a child of 
New York
 when you arrived? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
35
A: Oh, it was great, great place, my -- you 
know, my a-a-abiding 
goal at the time 
was to become fluent in English and th at 
time I -- by that time I was six, I think and 
so I didn™t speak any English. And I pick
ed it up, and both my  mo ther and father 
worked, so I was very 
mu ch during that time, a street kid on my  own. And th at was 
fine. 

Q: What part of 
New York
 Did you settle in? 
A: Well, we lived in -- very shortly after 
we arrived, we had a small apartment at 
315 
West 74
th
 Street, which put me in the same
 school district as you were in, 
P.S. 
9, 
although I think under somewhat grander ci
rcumstanc es. But, so I was a stu d ent 
at 
P.S. 9, 
and we lived on what™s known as the 
Upper West Side
.  
Q: Did you feel very different from 
the other children, having come from 
Europe? 
A: No. And remember, we all had the common 
experience of the war, that we were 

-- there was rationing, gas rationing and 
rubber rationing for tir
es and so on. And 
my father was working 
in a defense plant in 
Brooklyn
, so the main occupation, the 
main thought as I had as a child was th
at of World War II, and that was a common 
experience with all of us. 

Q: Was your mo ther work ing? 
A: Yes, yes, they were both wo rking, a
nd I had this curious experience of being 
there -- how to put it? There are child
ren who grew up in very modest

circumstances and whose parents somehowbecame wealthy. Or, whose -- or who 
had parent -- who, as parent
s were poor -- as children,
 excuse me, before they 
became parents were poor, but they  made it 
as adults. And so  there™s often this 
busin ess of 
Edward
 my  son, you know, whatever the kid wants, he can have. Bu t 
wi -- I lived in the reverse,
 that my parents were -- gr
ew up ex tremely wealthy, and 
were extremely poor. So they lived poo
r, but thought rich. And when you lived  

poor and thought rich -- you think rich, 
you do certain things that you don™t 
otherwise do. Fo r example, they never t
hought that it would -- that I should have 
some kind of babysitter. Well, 
they hadn™t had th
e money for babysitters, so I just 
was, from a very young age, I was just le
ft alone. And that -- apparently survived, 
so --  

Q: What kind of wo rk 
did your mo ther do? 
A: She was a dressmak er. She learned how 
to sew, and she made custom clothes 
for 
Henri Bendel
. 
Q: So, did sh e wo rk out of your apartment? 
A: Part of the time. M o st of the time, t
hough, she worked as a 
seamstress in -- at 
Henri Bendel.
 
Q: And their English was good al
so? They picked
 it up easily? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
37
A: Yes, yes. Funny story, my father™s ni -- name was 
Marian
 and it was spelled -- 
it was a very common Polish name, 
M-a-r-i-a-n
, and he was in the World War II 
New York 
phone book as 
Marian Glass, 
and so he would get propositioned by the 
sailors coming through and so 
on. So -- but I remember fr
 -- and so he changed his 
name to 
Martin
, self defense. But I-I remember 
ver -- by clear memories as, you 
know, seven, eight years old, of playing in 
Riverside Drive
, which was a training 
facility for the army and 
the navy. And I w
ould kind of 
march along with the 
soldiers who were living in 
the -- what is now the Hotel
 Beacon
, on 
Broadway
. 
And they  would march down 
74
th
 
Street, past the 
Schwab 
mansion. We lived 
across the street from the 
Schwab
, into 
Riverside Drive
, and there was a -- kind of 
a parade round there, where they would 
drill and I would become the mascot of 
these young soldiers who were ge
tting ready to go abroad, fight. 
Q: Did your -- did you feel different than
 th e other children, or did you tell the 
other kids where you came from,  or did your
 teachers know, or di-discuss that with 
you, with  your parents? 
A: 
Gail
, I tried very hard to hide
 my identity because I wanted
 to be accepted as an 
American. I made up stories that I was a descendent of 
An drew Jackson
 because 
our names were the same. I-I was seve
n or eight. Seven maybe. A -- by eight I 
guess I -- I knew that that wo
uldn™t work. Six, seven. Bu t I never discussed my

38
background with any of my friends. I was 
an Am-American like 
they -- they were, 
and I -- I wa -- I suppose I repressed all of 
that, but that wouldn™t be the right word , 
I was just -- I didn™t want to be different
, I didn™t want to stand out. I wanted to  
excel as a student and all of
 that, but only on the same 
terms as everyone else.  
Q: Would you describe
 yourself as an independent child? 
A: Extremely so, and of course living in 
New York
 in the 1940™s ma-make you 
even more de -- independent, so I th
ought nothing of walking over to 
Broadway
, 
putting a dime or a nickel, I don™t remember what it was in -- in the trolley car fare 
box. Or maybe at that time kids di
dn™t pay, and ju st going down  to 
Times Squa re
 
on my  own as a seven year old, eight year 
old. I was a street kid, and I knew how to 
get up and down  
Broadway 
on the trolley car. On w -- 
about the time that I w as 
eight, my  mo ther would give me a quarter 
on Saturday morning 
so I could go to the 
newsreel, which was at 
72
nd
 
and 
Broadway
. And so, as a very young person, my 
experiences of the war were watching th
ings being blown up by -- as the war 
progressed.  

Q: Well, since you had come from that part 
of the wo rld, how di
d that affect you? 
Was it very frightening for you to sit in th
e movie theater, and did you identify with 
them? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
39
A: No, it was just exciting. Was just -- 
I si -- m-maybe one
 reason why I later 
gravitated to the newspaper business was th
at I was interested in the news as a 
child. But I didn™t -- I -- I was not a fearfu
l child, I was -- I was quite -- I mean, one 
of the things that I would do as a child, 
since I was left alone a lot, would be to 
throw matches out the window. And I was pr
etending that I was bombing. I mean, I 
wa -- and because the matches would fall f
our stories and light on the concrete 
below, and start little fires actually  -- some
times the fire d epartment came -- in the 
rubbish. And that was the way I amused my self. 
Q: Because you had rememb
ered planes coming over wh
en you were young, or 
why do you think you did that? 
A: Well, I mean, we can get into the 
psychological and psyche -- psychiatric 
aspects of this, but I-I -- who -- I played at war, and war was play, and it was not 
fearful. 

Q: Yeah. Did your parents re-react in fr
ont of you as the wa
r kept going on and 
news kept coming out about Jews in 
Euro pe
, did they  express that to you? 
A: Not -- 
Ga il
, not to my recollection. I -- I ha
d no recollection of the Holocaust 
except after the war as a teenager by -- you
 know, I was 10 when the war ended, 11 
maybe, and b-by then  of an 
age when all of this made 
sense to me, but -- and then

of course my sister -- excuse me, my 
father™s sister, my 
aunt, who survived, 
Helen e 
-- Helena
, s-survived the -- the 
war in a Nazi work ca
mp, what did they -- 
Q: La-Labor -- 
A: Labor -- 
Q: Labor camp. 

A: Labor camp . And her husband 
Joseph 
somehow made it to 
Italy
. They were 
separated, and fought in -- in General 
Anders 
army in 
[indeciphera ble]
 was 
wounded in 
Montecassino
, and --  
Q: Oh. 

A: -- and they survived the war, so th
ey -- they somehow 
made it to -- to 
England
 
and my  father helped  them, but they had a daughter named 
Christina
 who™s now 
about three years younger than I, who th
ey left with the housekeeper, their 
housekeeper and she surviv ed the war in 
Warsaw
. And then the housekeeper 
wouldn™t release the -- 
Christina
, who was brought up as a 
Christian, as Catholic. 
And my  father sent 5,000 dollars to 
Wa rsa w
, which at that time, 1945, was a lot of 
money. So somehow he got her to 
England
. And she grew up in 
England
. I met 
her when I was 17 or so when I was in 
England
, and then they 
moved eventually. 
They  moved to 
Australia 
and she™s now living in 
Australia
, but quite ill with 
Parkinson™s 
Disease, but has children and the ch
ildren are doctors and doing very

well. Another sister, 
Genya
 was also -- survived th
e war, also made it to 
Australia
. 
Through the Soviet -- was arrested by the 
Soviets and released when  the war began 
-- when -- when 
-- when the -- 
Q: Liberation? 

A: No, when  
Hitler 
attacked -- Operation 
Barbarosa
. And so there was a bunch of 
people who were in labor  camps i-in northern 
Siberia
 who somehow made it -- I 
don™t know how, because it wasn™t my  story, but they  made it to 
Persia - Iran
. 
From there they went to 
India
 where my cousin 
Peter 
was born. Also did not sur -- 
deceased now, but -- so 
Genya
 and her husband made it to 
Australia
, where 
Peter
 
became a doctor and a lawyer and a diplomat
 and eventually became the Australian 
ambassador of the Un ited Nations. He was Australian ambassador to 
Vietnam
 
during th e 
Vietnam 
war, and ended up as the head of the civil service in 
Australia
, 
which is a very big deal under the Australia
n system. And unfortunately, he died of 
brain cancer in 
Seattle 
in 1997. But we were cl -- we were very close.  
Q: When  you were going to  school, the t
eachers obviously knew 
your place of birth 
was 
Poland
. Did th ey ever say anything to you 
or treat you any differently than the 
other children? 

A: Not to my recollection, although we spo 
-- I must say, we spoke Polish at home, 
and I™m s -- while I don™t use Polish, if I -- I™ve been to 
Warsaw
, I™ve -- and other

Polish cities four times, with the Pope, the Po
lish Pope, as a ri -- 
as a journalist, so 
whenever I would tr-travel there, I woul
d -- Polish would come back quickly and 
I™ve conversed with the Po-Pope in
 Polish, with no problem. So -- 
Q: So it sounds like you felt ve
ry American pretty soon on? 
A: Yeah, yes. I mean, I labored at not 
being different, and th at was my  highest 
priority. And -- 

Q: Did you know any other re
fugee children at that time? 
A: I had a close friend, 
Robert Eisenthal,
 who was also in our class at 
P.S. 9,
 who 
came from 
England
 then by way of 
Belgium
, whose parents -- whose father was 
Polish, mother was, I believe, English. An
d we were close friends. That -- that was 
in -- 

Q: Did you exchange stories and talk
 about wh at you had been thro ugh? 
A: No, but you know, there we
re these th -- we were poor, they were rich. His first 

cousin
 Henry Geltsaller
, who -- with whom I went to 
Yale
, and who also died, 
yeah, lived on 
Central Park West
, and so wh en we visited 
Henry, 
who was our 
age, it was kind of grand. But other than
 that, no. I mean, we were -- I-I -- I -- I 
would -- treated myself and was treated as an American. 
Q: Okay, the war is now over, it™s 1945, do
 you rememb er any ce
lebration of your 
parents, or anything specific about that time? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
43
A: The only thing I do remember is -- and 
I was about 11, is -- at the -- that time 
the 
New York Times 
had the war news on page two in  official communiqués, 
issued by -- e-every day there was a 
communiqué by each  of the comb atant 
governments, including the Germans, and I 
re -- I -- I would read that. And so the 
war was very, you know, important in that 
way, and remembered the wa -- the fact 
that the windows in the school had masking 
tape on them in case we were bombed. 
And so I remember asking my parents 
now that the war was over, I asked my  
father, would newspapers still be publis
hed. That was a serious question because 
the -- I thought of newspapers as being wa
r news, I didn™t equate it with any other 
kind of news, and I didn™t see any ne
ed for newspapers after the war. The 
newspapers were to tell us about 
the war, and so no war, no newspapers. 
Q: So you don™t rememb er a
ny specific celebration th at your parents had that the 

war was over? 

A: Well, th -- I have a very clear memory 
of my parents crying at -- at A-April 12
th
, 
I think it was, of 1945 when  President 
Roo sev elt
 died. Kind of -- that was the only 
president we knew, and of course he, by 
signing th at executive order, allowed us to 
stay in the 
United States
, which was becoming precarious. So  that™s a clear 
memo ry , 
Roosev elt™s
 death. And after that I just grew up. 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
44
Q: And then more and more came out abou
t the Ho locaust. How did you -- you or 
your family react to tho -- that news? 
A: Not really, I mean the -- the -- the th
ing that affected me mo st about the 
Holo caust, frankly, was as an adult traveling to 
Israel
, and particularly being with 
Jimmy Carter 
at the 
Yad Vashem
. And I don™t cry as an adult, but I did cry then, 
and I was one of a few reporters, and I think
 Carter
 may have known my  story, or 
I may have said something to
 Jody  Powell
 that -- without really going into it, why 
it was -- it was -- I said -- I think I said it 
was important to me personally to  be at 
Yad Vashem
 with President
 Carter
, and would it be okay. And so I™ve had these 
adult experiences. Another one I had of 
a similar nature wa
s in 1993 when I 
happened  to  be in 
Warsaw
 with Vice President
 Gore
 i-in which 
Gore 
and th e 
Israeli president at the time,
 made a speech a-at the memo
rial for the -- the Jews on 
the 50
th
 an niversary of the -- of the ghetto uprising, wh ich was celebrated in
 
Warsaw
, and I just happened to  be in 
Warsaw
 at the time, not for this, but 
Al 
Gore
 and so on, so I was with 
Gore. 
And a-as a 
Washington
 Bureau Chief for the 
Cox 
newspapers. And so I reme mber being ve
ry mu ch affected by th at ceremony, 
and crying. And -- and -- and just th-the th
ought that with -- with very few changes 
in parameters, that I co uld 
have been in that ghetto. 
And, you know, going to  the 
Holo caust Museum and seeing children of 
my  age walk ing in  that large -- y-you 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
45
know what I mean, th
e -- the large kind of photogra
ph, blown up photograph of the 
ghetto with the trolley car coming throug
h and everyone wearing th e armb ands and 
so on. I-I could easily see my
self being there and that 
-- I would end on the note 
that it was really quite remark
able that I wasn™t there, and that we are having this 
interview as I approach my 70
th
 year.  
Q: So you continue
d your schooling in  
New York. 
You -- you finished elementary 
school and then wh at happened? 
A: 
Joan of Arc 
Junior High School, 
Bronx 
High School of Science
, Yale
 College, 
and then a career in journalism followe
d -- a -- a short time in the army.  
Q: And did you share -- as you were growi
ng up in  high school and in college and 
so forth, did you share your back ground 
with other people? Did people know about 
that? 
A: No. No, the only place I 
shared it was on my  passport, which said I was born in 
Warsaw.
 Bu t, no. 
Q: Purposely, or you just didn™t think it was important? 
A: It was just part of my li -- my  fathe
r, when I was a young adult s-said to me, I 
have just three requests of you. And on
e of them was, never f -- never go to 
Germany
. And the second one was, never bu
y a German car, although I think he 
said germ -- 
Mercedes Benz
, but he meant German car. And he also asked me not 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
46
to marry outside the faith. Tho-Those are 
the three -- he said, otherw ise you can do 
anything you want in life. But guess whic
h one of those requests I™ve honored  in -- 
in life. None. But we got along fine. 
Q: So you said you ch ose to go into  jour
nalism, and you thought maybe it related to 
your experience as a child following the war news? 
A: Well, just an exciting way of -- of -- as
 a high school student I wo rked  at the 

New York Herald Tribune
 delivering ads and picki
ng up th e weather map from 
the weather bureau at the battery, and I 
earned enough money to travel, which I 
often enjo yed. So I traveled thro ugh western 
Euro pe, 
didn™t go to eastern 
Europe
 
til qu-quite later. But I never thought of myse
lf other than as an American, and the 
experiences of the war was, I would say quite honestly that I 
[indecipherable]
 
thought about it until this in
terview, I suppose I repre
ssed them. People have asked 
me, why didn™t I write about it, and that™s 
a good question, I just didn™t. I mean, I 
was a writer, and I -- I read stories in the 
New Yorker
 that have -- about similar 
subjects that have -- mi ght say less poignanc
y or even less relevance than my  own 
story, if it were told that way, as a pers
onal history. But I -- I just d idn™t do it. I 
didn™t want to. And why, I™m not quite -- 
e-even to this day I™m not quite clear 
why.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
47
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Andrew Glass
. This is tape number two, side
 
B.
 
A: Well, what I™ll say is that over the y
ears I™ve gotten to know quite a few Polish 
diplomats. I™ve interviewed the Po lish pr
esident, I™ve interviewed the mayor of
 
Warsaw
, prime ministers and so on, and spen t time in 
Poland
. Parenthetically, my 
father and mother traveled a good de
al. My father was an international 
businessman, but he never returned to 
Poland
, never returned to
 germa -- ne-never 
returned to 
Germany
. Traveled to 
Israel
 quite often, 
England, France, Italy. 
Australia
, of course, where were had family
. An-an -- or they would meet in 
Honolu lu
 or 
Easter Island
 or somewhere. But I got -- as
 I said, I got 
to know quite 
a few Poles over the years, including the P
ope, and so my view of the Polish role 
during World War II, quite hone
stly I would say, is a lo
t more nuanced and quite 
different than my father™s -- what I rega
rded and still regard, I suppose, as a one-
dimensional view that all Poles are bad. So
 generational-ly we never agreed, but we 
never talked  about that. 
Q: Becau -- you never talked about it because? 
A: Well, because it was -- I mean, my fa
ther™s mind was made up on the subject 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
48
and there was no point in my  saying look,
 there were also Poles who, unlike the 
ones that you co ndemn -- I mean, he made a great point for the fact that 
Hitler
 felt 
comfortable cre -- setting up death camp s in 
Poland
 and to my knowledge, I guess, 
Czechoslovakia, 
but th-that was -- th-the -- that 
he didn™t feel comf ortable in 
having say, death camps in 
France
 or 
Denmark
 or anywhere not on German soil 
that wasn™t 
Poland
. And so that -- that weighed 
heavily with my father, that 
Auschwitz
 was in 
Poland
 and others, may -- five, six 
ma jor death camp s. And th at, 
you know, th-the numb ers there are very star
k. There was, at th
e time that the war 

began -- I told you earlier 
[indecipherable]
 story of our flight, there were 
3,100,000 Jews living in  
Poland.
 And wh ile it™s not -- the numbers are not quite 
precise, they range betw een 100,000 and 150,
000 who survived out of that total, 
who were in 
Poland
 wh en the war began. Some had left to go to  
Israel
, some had 
escaped earlier, but of the number that were 
there, I mean, you can do the math. It -
- it -- it -- it™s a very small -- and so, 
that has kind of created in my  mind, 
Gail
, a -- 
how to put it? A fact that I have a -- a -- 
a get out of jail free card. That e-every day 
that I live, statistically I shouldn™t be 
alive. And so  I-I would, over time, as a 
journalist, I would find myself in 
some very dangerous places, like 
Detroit
 in the 
middle of a huge race riot, which was more
 of a National Guard riot, but that™s 
another story. Or in 
Afghanistan
 with the Soviet troops fighting the 
mujahideen
.

Gulf War
 with the scuds coming ov
er, and everybody kind of 
hiding, and I felt no fear. And I -- you kno
w, the reaction was, you know, why -- 
why were these people kind of afraid th
at they™re going to die, bec -- and you 
know, rationally there was a real risk that one of these 
mujahideen
 bullets that was 
meant for the 
spiznars
 would hit me cause I was in 
the -- harm™s w ay in each of 
these cases. But I felt kind of like who -- 
well, you know, I™m -- I™m living on 
borro wed time anyway, so what? And so I™m
 sure that it wou -- it™s not going to  
happen but if I was in 
Iraq 
today I would care less about my  personal safety. 
Q: Which feeds into a ques
tion I was going to ask you a 
little later, is, do you think 
you™re a different kind of person th
an you would have 
been if you hadn™t 
experienced the childhood that you had?
 Let™s say that you were born in the 
United 
States
 and had a very  relaxed early childhood
. Is this because of wh at you did go 
through that you had these feelings? 
A: Well, it just -- as an  a -- I suppose as
 an adult, the realization that I was a 
survivor and that the chance
s of surviving statistically in my particular case, 2200 

out of, I think 600,000 in 
Lithuania, 
almost all of whom died. I mean, the odds of 
getting out were -- in the 
first instance out of 
Warsaw
 and in the second instance 
out of 
Lithuania, 
third instance not being 
arrested in -- in the 
Soviet Union
 as -- as 
o-obvious bourgeois, and the fo urth instance leaving 
Japan
 just at the right time or

not, a-as many in th at group of 2200 ch oosing to go to th e Du tch 
East Indies, 
it 
seemed lik e a good -- good idea at
 the time. I mean all -- or 
Shanghai
 -- all of 
those were just, you know, five cush
ioned billiard shots, to arrive in 
San 
Francisco
, destitute financially, but -- but he
althy and -- and ready to, you know, 
start a new life. So I think honestly, that 
realization came to me only as a -- as an 
adult, or at least as a 
teenager, not as a child. 
Q: You finished college, and then  did yo
u say you went into the army, into the 
service? 
A: Yeah -- no, I finished college and I went
 into journalism and then I was drafted 
and I served  in the army , but never abroad . And then  I went back  to journalism and 
eventually went to the 
New York Herald Tribune
, which in 1962 sent me to 
Washin gton
 as -- that time, I was 
also married and we™ve been -- been here since. 
The 
Hera ld  Tribune
 folded. I wo
rked for awhile -- 
four years for the 
Wash ington 
Post, 
and then I worked for -- on the hill for a couple of years for Senator 
Javits
 as 
his press secretary and Senator 
Percy 
as his administrative a ssistant. I returned to 
journalism in 1971 and work
ed four years for the ﬁ
National Journalﬂ
 as an editor -
- it™s still going. And th
en in 1974 
I joined 
Cox 
newspapers, which founded a 
bureau here and I worked fro
m 1974 to  19 -- to 2001 fo r 
Cox 
newspapers, 21 of 
those years as the chief of the 
Wash ington 
bureau. And had a year at 
Harvard
 as a

fellow and then work
ed, and still do, for 
The Hill
 newspapers as a writer and for a 
while as the managing editor. And I™m looki
ng fo r other things to write about, but 
not the Holocaust. 
Q: Y-You talked -- yo-you said you haven™
t written, and you just said, and not. Can 
you just elaborate a little bit more, why not? 
A: Well, I -- I don™t know. I mean, I -- obvi
ously I should. I wrote -- I think I wrote 
one column about ca -- it was a co lu
mn  about immigration policy in 
California
 and 
how illegal aliens were being 
treated badly. And I told a 
little bit of my story, not a 
lot, but I mainly concentrat
ed  on  my  mo th er 
-- excuse me, on my mother-in-law, 

who was also an illegal -- is -- I mean, I ma
de the point that we were illegal aliens 
and that my father-in-law and mother-in-la
w were illegal. And she returned to her 
native
 Italy
 after the war -- which was devastat
ed. They were -- the family was 
from an area just south of 
Naples
 called 
Terra Del Greco, 
just in the shadow of
 
Mount Vesu vius
 near 
Pompeii
 and so she came back and then sh e wanted to 
return after about six months and her pape
rs, as they say, were not in order. And 
they wouldn™t let her on the -- 
on the ship an d so I think my  sister™s brothers went 

to see a congressman who was the head 
of the State Department committee that 
arranged for the State Department to ge
t money. He was State Justice Commerce 
Appropriations Ch air 
John J. Rooney.
 And they pointed out to 
Rooney
 that 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

nobody asked about the citizen
ship when two of my wife™s brothers were killed in 
World War II, and so why were they ra
ising these questi
ons now? And so 
Roo n ey
 
made a -- a call to the State Department and -- or passed a private bill, or -- no, I 
think he just made a call to the State De
partment, she was on the next boat back 
from 
Naples.
 And I told  that story in a column  
that I wrote about, and that made an 
impression on me that, you know, here 
were two relatively successful -- a 
Harvard
 
educated psychiatrist and a 
Wa shington
 Bureau Chief who were, you know, from 
illegal alien s, so give me a break. So th
at was -- but that was a 600 word  column, 
so that 
[indecipherable]
 ma-made an impact
, on me anyway.  
Q: You said you have a son, did you -- wh
en he was very , very young, up -- even a 
toddler, did that bring back memo ries of
 what you had to go th rough when  you 
were his age? 

A: No, but one story, my  am
 -- as I said, my -- my grandfather™s house, there was a 
housekeeper who, when  this house -- ma
nsion really, was taken over by the bil-
billeted Germans, she was of course, th
rown out. And she managed to save a 
cottage cup -- two, I think. And so after th
e war -- a-a -- and a lot of this -- this -- 
this cottage cup was from mid-18
th
 century, and quite valuable, but mo re valuable 
as silver, just to melt it
 down. And a lot of this stuff was melted down because 
these people 
[indecipherable]
 but she saved it. And so  my  father help ed her, of

53
course; after the war they sent he
r money. And so wh en I went to 
Wa rsa w
 he 
asked me to look her up, she was in her mid-
90™s by that time. A
nd she insisted that 
I take these cottage cups back with me, one
 of which I gave to my father. I don™t 
know wh at happened  to  it, I don™t have it,
 ma ybe my  mother has it. And one I kept 
myself. And my son, who was a toddler -- 
a little older than a toddler, but about the 
same age th at I was when I arrived here, said 
Daddy
, when you die, can I have th is 
cup? And that was a profoundly  imp -- im
p -- it impressed me. It impressed me. 
And of co urse his mo ther was Catholic 
and I was Jewish and we had to decide 
whether we™re going to rear him as a Catho
lic or as a Jew, or none of the above, 
and so we reared him as a Jew, and so he is a Jew. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Has he been to 
Poland
 at all? Have you taken him and sh own 
him 
Warsaw
? 
A: No, I don™t think -- he™s been to 
Prague
, he™s been to 
Berlin 
a couple of times, 
he™s going to  
Berlin
 next week. Bu t he™s never been to 
Warsaw
. I™d like him to go.  
Q: Do you consider 
yourself a Zionist? 
A: No, no, I consider myself an Americ
an. I have no Zionist feelings. And I™ve 
been to 
Israel
 quite a bit, but only as a journalis
t, not as a Zionist. Not recently, but 
a lot during the time of the -- the war 
and th e -- and I™ve gotten to  know many 
Israelis, I mean, we lived literally behind
 the Israeli ambassador™s house, which 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
54
didn™t used to have a fe
nce when  th e ambassador was 
Yitzhak Rabin. 
So we got to 
know 
Ra bin
, largely because my dog would 
often -- our little puppy then, would 
often end up in 
Rabin™s 
backyard , so we would have to  retrieve him and I got to 
know 
Ra bin
 that way, but also professionally 
wrote about him, and visited with 
him when  I went to 
Israel
. 
Q: When  you -- wh en you are in 
Israel
, do you feel any connection to the country? 
A: No, I mean, no -- none -- no, no, no -- 
Q: Or is it just another foreign country? 
A: Well, it™s a special place. I feel
 more at home there th an say in 
Sa udi Arabia
, 
but that™s because it™s a western democracy that has 
McDonald ™s
 and -- and 
parliament, the 
Knesset 
and so on. Not because I™m Jewish or anything like th at. 
But I™ve had close friends who made 
aliyah
 and who lived in
 Israel
 and I visited 
them when I was in 
Isr ael 
for other pur -- not pa-particul
arly to see them, but while 
taking -- taking in -- of course, some of the family, distant cousin s ended up in
 
Israel
, so -- 

Q: Are you angry that you had to go th rou
gh a difficult time and the res -- some of 
the rest of us didn™t have to go thro
ugh that time? And that your f -- you had the 
losses, extended family losses that you had? 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

55
A: A-A-Anger, or regret or remorse, 
I-I -- I -- not anger. I mean, we drive a 
Mercedes
 and I pointed out to my father one time -- an d a 
Mercedes
 saved my 
wife™s life in an a -- in a terrible collision,
 but that it™s really
 been built by Serbs. 
Na -- and if there are any German
 workers in that factory near 
Munich
, they -- they 
weren™t around during 
World War II, so -- 
Q: Are there any sounds or sights that remi
nd you, that bring back  any memo ries of 
-- well, let™s say the -- the -- th
e bombing, that very early 
sensation that you had, or 
your travels in 
Europe
? Anything today that triggers it? 
A: The bombing? Well, you know, going to
 Warsaw
 and seeing pictures as you 
have of -- of the devastation -- of all t
hose cities, I mean, I 
-- I ma -- one of my 
clear memo ries 
[indecipherable]
 is going to
 Euro pe
 in 1953 which was what, six 
years, seven years after the war? 
Q: Tha-That was your first trip back? 

A: Yeah, as a 17 year old, and seeing, yo
u know, devastated cities and seeing the 
damage in -- in central 
London
, seeing even  worse damage
 along the Belgian coast 
where we were cycling, 
Ostend, Brussels, 
so on. 
Q: And how did y
ou go, did you go with your family? 
A: No, with a -- just with a fri
end, just a-a -- as a -- just
 as -- for a three month trip. 
But you know, that br
ought the war back very, very 
clearly. And I remember g o ing

to 
Italy
 where we stayed in youth hostels an
d a door would open very slowly  and 
the proprietor or the prop -- say
 Tedeschi,
 which is -- so she knew we weren™t 
Italian -- which is Italian for 
Germans. And we say no, no, 
Americani
. Oh, 
Americani
, 
bene, bene, bene,
 you know, so 
[indecipherable]
 couldn™t -- so being 
an American in that -- in 
Europe
 at that time, eight years after the war, I guess, 
ended, was still quite an experience. 
Q: Do you feel Po
lish in any way? 
A: No, no. I mean, I™m on the 
list, so to speak, every tim
e there™s an event at the 
Polish embassy, they invite me and so
metimes I go. And I™ve been to the 

ambassador™s home -- he lives in the neighb
orhood -- for lunch and dinner and that 
kind of thing. And I -- I-I -- I -- when I wa
s president of the Gr
idiron Club and sat 
next to President 
Bush
 -- this was in 2001 -- you get 
to invite, you know, whoever 
you want, and I just kind of, you know, on 
a lark I invited the Polish ambassador to 
the dinner, he had never been to a Gridiron
 dinner, didn™t know what it was. And I -
- I made a joke, you know, Po lish joke, an
d that they wanted not a -- a -- a Polish 
president, they wanted a pres
ident with some
 polish. And 
Bush 
was very gracious, 
he said that he -- he had been  president th
en  for just about three months and he told 
me off the record -- well, not 
off the record, just 
told me that he was planning to go 
to 
Poland
, which was news, no one knew that. 
And I had -- one of the things I did 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
57
was to set up a -- a bureau in and within th e bureau of 
[speaks Polish here] 
which 
means election newspaper in 
Polish. And so we had a 
correspondent th
ere because 
Cox
 had invested in -- in that newspaper 
after the fall of communism, helped them 
out. It was -- turned out to be a very 
good investment, we™re de-investing it now, 
but made a lot of money. An yway, I had so
mething to do with 
that. So we -- we 
had this -- and I would make trips to 
Poland
 to help the newspape
rs set -- set it a -- 
set up and exchange news, so I gave that news to the 
Gazetta 
correspondent who 
was working in the 
Cox
 bureau, and so  they had a big ex clusive that 
Bush 
was 
coming to 
Poland
 on a -- on -- on -- on good author
ity. I couldn™t -- couldn™t give 
them my  source, but I said, you can take 
it to the bank, I know
 it™s true. The guy I 
talked to knows what he™s talking abou
t. And so I™ve had lunch with the Polish 
ambassador and so on, and we 
talk in Polish or in Englis
h, it™s -- and it™s -- and I™m 
comfortable with that. 
Q: And are you comfortable when  you™re in
 Poland
 walking on th e streets of 
[indecipherable]
  
A: Well, it™s interestin g, because you know
, I™m identified as an American and I™ve 
-- most of the trips I™ve taken to 
Poland
 would have been w
ith -- with the first 
President
 Bush,
 or with President
 Clinton
, or with 
J i mmy  Ca rter
 and I would just 
be a memb er of the White House press co
rps, and they  would make comments and 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
58
believing that what they were saying wa
 -- and I -- you know, I would say nothing, 
but then  when I would leave, I would make
 a tart remark in Polish and their jaws 
would drop. So that was fun, you know
, to be a kind of 
a hidden Pole -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- as a member of the White House press corps. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But other than that, no. 
Q: What are your feelings when you™re in 
Germany
? 
A: Normal. It™s the largest country in 
Europe
 and I™ve been going to 
Germany
 -- I 
star -- I guess I started going 
when we -- the economic su
mmits st arted, which was 
in the late 70™s, and they  would -- as 
you know, they would ro
tate and one would 
be in 
Bo nn
 every seven years, so I would go to 
Bonn
 fo r that. And then I would go 
with 
Carter
 to 
Berlin
 and I think I went with President
 Ford 
to 
Germany
, I don™t 
remember that, but I™ve been  there quite a bit. And re
cently on holiday with my 
wife, who just loved 
Berlin
. And my  son is going to 
Berlin
 next week. He™s an 
MBA
 at 
Columbia
 and the class is going to 
Germany
 on so me business trip. And 
he wa -- also had a scholarship to 
Heidelberg
 and learned German at 
Yale,
 so -- all 
of that was after my father died. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass  
 
February 14, 2005 
 

 
 
59
A: But, speaks really fluent German. 
Q: Do you think there are 
any lessons to be learned 
from what you experienced, 
what your family experienced? 
A: Well, there™s got to be existential le
sson of -- of how life 
is precious and how -- 
without getting too deep  about it, how th
e road  taken an d the road not taken can 
make a very big difference in life. And 
-- and the randomness of who su rviv es and 
who doesn™t survive, co-co
upled  with the low odds of
 survival have made an 
impression on me, but not as a child, or even
 as a -- as a teenag
er, but more as an 
adult, and particularly late 
in life, which 
would lead to things like an interest in 
doing this interview. 
Q: Why bef -- in -- in the years past, did yo
u not feel the need, or did -- o-or why is 
it now th at you feel more? Becaus
e of the stage of life we™re in? 
A: I don™t know, I mean I -- I™ve just 
taken it in, the Holocaust Museum. We 
became friends with a couple th
at had a -- a lot to do -- a 
Baltimore
 couple that had 
a lot to do with setting up the museum and 
they became close friends of ours. And 

then I-I was on the convention plat -- conve
ntion arrangements committee for the 
American Society of Newspa
per Editors and I arranged for the editors to have a 
separate and -- tour of the mu seum when 
the mu seum first opened, and of -- also 
for 
Ted Koppel 
to lead in a very interesting 
discussion at the mu seum about 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

60
Holocaust denial by the American press 
during World War II, and particularly the 
role of the 
New York Times
. So I had a -- you know, I™v
e had a -- a -- a role -- a 
role that -- that way. 
Q: Y-You™re talking about
 now, for instance, the 
New York Times
 not giving as 
much space in the paper to what was 
happening. Does that
 make you angry? 
A: No, but it™s been well documented and they
 -- they didn™t want to be -- a -- a -- a 
friend of mine, 
Alex Jones
 wrote a book ab out history of the 
New York Times, 
and he was the creator -- cur -- 
cur -- curator of a program at 
Harvard 
that I 
participated in, the 
Kennedy 
School of Politics as a fellow,
 and of course he has a 
lot in there about the 
Times
 not wanting to  identify itself as a Jewish newspaper 
during World War II, and so  that was -- 
Q: That -- does that elicit any em
otional feeling in -- in you? 
A: Truthfully no, no. Just -- one of the things, 
Gail
, as you become a journalist, at 
least in my generation of jo
urnalists is that you -- you 
-- you -- y-you step out of 
your skin  a lot. You feel that you™re a so
mewhat classless person and that the very 
rich and the very important bear no special 
role in your life to the homeless person, 
they have equal balance. And I feel that ve
ry strongly, I always have. And I -- i-i-in 
the sense that as a leader, a bureau chief 
and so on, I™ve tried to inculcate leading 
by ex ample, that you, in the younger generati
on of journalists, not to be in aw e of -- 

 
Interview with Andrew Glass

61
of the rich and powerful and no
t to be -- look down at anyone who is in trouble or 
in -- in jail or in -- in mode
st circumstances, treat them
 all the same, the same. And 
perhap s in my  own background, you know, 
that growing up poo
r, but with a rich 
mentality if you will. That may have ha
d something to do 
with why I became a 
journalist, I don™t know. It™s too deep for me. 
Q: When you go into the 
Holocaust Museum here in 
Washington, 
does it give you 
any sp -- di-different feelings? 
A: Well, as I said, particularly the view of the 
Warsaw
 ghetto and th e br -- the role 
of that. I™ve recently visited the -- not 
a Holocaust museum, but a German -- a 
museum recently o -- that opened in -- in 
Berlin
 that traces the story of Jews in 
Germany
, and I felt no particular -- I didn™t have that feeling. But I™ve been to 
Warsaw
 and talked  to people who are trying 
to create a Holocau
st museum against 
some odds in -- in 
Warsaw,
 and so I tried to help them with the -- the sense of 
giving th em some -- some support. 
Q: Did you have any co nnection with Professor 
Jan Karski
 when he was living in  
Washin gton
 and teaching at 
Georgetown
? 
A: Yes, I knew him and I talked to him.
 I me t him at the embassy, I had several 
meals  with  h im. I me t h im also  in  
Warsaw
 wh en he was back th
ere, not that long 
ago, shortly before he died. I knew  him.
 He was a very important figure, yup.

Q: Did you feel a Polish connection to him, being born  in 
Poland
 yourself? 
A: Well, I feel a connection to Po les and -- and I™m Polish, I mean that -- it says in 

Who™s Who in 
America
, born in 
Warsaw
, so that won™t go away . Maybe the 
listing in Who™s Who will end, but being born in 
Wa rsa w, 
well, that stays.  
Q: Well, as you say, is there anything we 
haven™t talked about 
that you wanted  to 
say on th e tape? 

A: What I wanted to say 
Gail 
is that I™ve been interviewed in different 
circumstan ces on -- and I m-mainly been on 
the other side of that mi crophone, and 
I don™t recall a mo re thorough, professiona
l interview than the one that you have 
just concluded.
